13828	18272	Tonight, February 7th, 2010, a new Sonic the Hedgehog game is announced.
18512	21314	Could you soon get premium Warcraft features on your iPhone?
21675	24137	And what first-person shooter is coming to Facebook?
31812	32232	Thanks for watching!
47467	48087	Anyway, hi.
48168	53010	We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
53390	54251	I'm here with you every week.
54291	55292	My name is Rob Roberts.
55432	59754	Joining me as always, say hello to the lady shouting fail, fail over there in the corner.
60575	63456	Our very own fail blog here in house, DarkSakura.
63496	64097	Fail!
64437	64777	How are you?
65836	66176	I win.
87216	87756	I like cookies.
87876	90057	Yes, so tonight he is Cookie Master Loki.
90318	92939	But I'm sure he'll talk about tech here and there as well.
92999	96240	In fact, you've been kind of over there hammering on YouTube, right?
96280	97561	What's going on over there on YouTube, Loki?
98281	103104	Well, they just uploaded my new video and disabled all the audio because they're awesome like that.
103764	104264	What happened?
104284	105505	Did you use copyright music?
105545	106365	Yeah, copyright.
106445	108987	But there's tons of videos out there that have copyright music in them.
109147	109607	That's lame.
109867	110367	I'm sorry to hear that.
110387	110668	It's all right.
110708	113109	We'll find someplace else to upload it because YouTube sucks.
113189	113529	There you go.
113917	114677	Daddy playin' the game!
140205	141385	Thank you for watching!
157150	158171	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
180495	182015	I played a crap ton of Star Trek online.
183036	191218	And then I realized when I decided to go on the quest to find Deep Space Nine that my little character had been just running around the promenade for about an hour and a half.
192059	192779	Just running around.
193539	194039	Doing nothing.
194739	195260	Running around.
196840	197460	And that's about it.
198641	199721	Except for some solitaire.
201377	203338	You've been playing actual solitaire on the computer?
204199	204959	Oh, on the iPhone.
204979	207681	I was going to say, do they even include solitaire on the computer anymore?
207901	208922	Yeah, it's included.
208962	210102	That and Spider Solitaire.
210122	210763	I haven't really looked.
211923	213945	A few others, Hearts and Freestyle and all that crap.
214145	214405	All right.
215886	216846	Loki, how was your gaming week?
217947	218567	It was pretty good.
219048	221909	I played more Borderlands and...
223755	225016	That's still entertaining me.
226237	227038	More Grand Theft Auto.
227618	228399	Finally made it.
229060	233664	I'm in the top 100 players now for true skill rankings.
233884	235886	So I'm in like the mid 90s now for that.
235966	236687	That's pretty awesome.
237447	242752	And working my way up just the cumulative ranked deathmatch stats.
243312	244774	So I think I'm
245765	247866	I don't know, it varies depending on how much I play it.
248626	251667	I think I'm around 230 something right now.
253228	257950	And then I purchased Bioshock 2, so I played a little bit of that.
258630	259890	And that one's actually pretty cool.
260010	261911	Very similar, obviously, to the first game.
262311	262731	Now, wait a minute.
262771	265472	I thought Bioshock 2 wasn't out until Tuesday, but you have the hookup, right?
265613	268254	It's not out until Tuesday, but it's pretty awesome.
270481	275063	So yeah, definitely worth checking out, especially if you like the first game.
275583	281346	It seems like there's going to be a lot of similarities between this game and the last one, but so far I'm digging it.
282666	282967	I don't know.
282987	284207	Do they have multiplayer in this one?
284347	284867	They do, yes.
285027	286568	Ah, fun.
286608	292291	That's going to be the big kicker right there, because that was one kind of glaring omission in the first one, and what a lot of people were clamoring for.
292371	294692	So I think that's probably the whole sale of the game right there.
294992	297173	I don't know if I'll even play the multiplayer, though.
298013	299894	It just doesn't seem like anything I'd be interested in.
300512	300953	Yeah, I know.
300973	304680	Whenever I play those multiplayer shooting games, I get raped in the face, and that's not a lot of fun.
304840	305822	Well, not necessarily that.
305842	308447	It just seems like tacked on or something, but whatever.
309915	310295	So that's it.
310955	311275	Alright.
311975	312516	My Gaming Week.
312536	313496	Kind of the same old stuff.
313536	317356	I've been playing more Bayonetta and World of Warcraft and some of those games.
317797	322257	The only new game I really checked out this week was one of the new Xbox Live Arcade games that they have called Chime.
323078	326198	Somebody on Twitter had posted, hey, if you like Luminous, you should play Chime.
326618	330659	And yeah, I could definitely see where somebody is making the comparisons between Chime and Luminous.
330999	332259	They're both puzzle games.
332660	334700	They're both heavily involved with music.
335160	342544	They both have a beat line that sweeps across the screen and they have very similar looking screens, might I say, that affects the gameplay.
342584	348007	But where the games get very different is that, you know, you could say Luminous is somewhat of a Tetris inspired game.
348527	352890	Chime is like, I'm going to get really old school here and I bet half the listeners don't even know what I'm talking about.
352950	355631	Chime is like Dedalion Opus on the Game Boy.
355992	357532	Anyone ever played Dedalion Opus?
359114	360375	A while back.
360435	363537	Yeah, it's one of these games here, since you probably haven't played it.
363577	364138	Here's what it is.
364198	368702	It's basically like you have all these shapes that you're trying to put in.
368722	371864	And they're all square based, but they might be in an L shape or a jagged shape.
371904	375808	And don't think just Tetris pieces, because sometimes they're like five or six blocks in a row.
376888	382653	And you try to fit them into this square or some other type of geometric shape.
382733	383034	I don't know.
383054	384475	I think maybe like tangrams.
385055	388357	But all based around Tetris style shapes, if that makes any sense at all.
388397	388717	I don't know.
388977	389998	You try to kind of fit them in there.
390358	399663	So Chime is about trying to make 3x3 squares as fast as you can out of these odd shapes, which it's a little harder than it sounds.
401064	402765	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
422840	429021	Ray Iannami in our chatroom, chat.orangelunchradio.com, Tetrominos, I think it's called.
429121	429881	I think that's it.
429981	430942	Yeah, what you're talking about there.
431022	431602	Same kind of idea.
432942	438663	So anyway, here's the thing is that as you build these blocks, your multiplier goes up the faster you build them.
438723	442844	And oddly enough, yeah, it enhances the music as you build.
443604	447025	There are songs by Moby, one of the guys from Orbital.
447805	477200	Phillip Glass has a song in there which I thought was totally random so there's some actually some big name talent in the game probably only about five songs in the game but it's only a five dollar game and I don't know maybe there will be expansions later but anyhow the beat sweeper will kind of sweep out your crap if you leave it behind too long like if you've let these isolated pieces that didn't get formed into blocks the beat sweeper will filter them out after it gets hit maybe like five times and then they all flush out and you lose your multiplier multiplier
477720	482782	So it's good for cleaning up the board, but it's bad for your score.
483182	484923	So that's the gist of Chime.
485643	487323	It's actually kind of a neat little puzzler.
488004	494806	I thought it was kind of cool, and the music was very trancy, zony, but I thought it was decent for a game like that.
494886	498047	And best of all, it's only $5, even though it's only five songs.
498407	502168	Now here's the thing, is that the game is supposed to go for charity.
502729	506310	They really advertise heavily in the game that 60% of the purchase price...
506770	510232	Go to these various children's charities and you can go online and look.
510713	518598	What I thought was a little weird though is that they actually as part of the sales pitch of the game say, buy this game and feel good about supporting charities.
518838	522881	Oh, and you get 50 gamer score just for buying the game.
523321	528805	Because there's an achievement that is called something like, and I'm paraphrasing here, feel good about yourself.
529285	529966	50 gamer score.
530026	532527	You can feel good about yourself and the purchase you've made of this game.
532867	536190	And it just gives you basically 50 gamer score for I guess going to the title screen.
537030	538191	I thought that was a little weird.
538411	539892	Like, yeah, I get it.
540052	540933	It's for charity.
541073	541854	It's a good thing.
542854	547217	But you're essentially buying gamerscore, if you think about it that way.
547258	557485	And it's not that I necessarily have a problem with that, with the charity angle, but the fact that it's kind of marketed like that is a little, I don't want to say off-putting, but that's the best word I can think of.
557845	561988	I would say, though, that it's more like just a little way of saying thank you for your donation.
562008	562108	Yeah.
563627	566789	I think that badge should be worth zero gamerscore if that's the case.
567389	573293	Like, I'm okay with there being like a little badge of pride like, yay, have your warm fuzzies for buying our charity game.
573633	580757	But I don't think it should be worth any gamerscore and I don't think they should be advertising like, hey, if you buy this game, we'll give you 50 gamerscore just for getting it.
581197	581717	Like, I don't know.
581757	582738	For me, that just kind of...
584464	587569	It just seems like it opens the floodgates to all this kind of like devious behavior.
587589	591874	Like I understand it's for charity and maybe like Microsoft kind of let him get away with that for all that.
592195	593577	And I'm not trying to like knock the game.
593717	599585	It just, when I kind of looked at that, I kind of made one of those raised eyebrow faces of that ain't right.
600566	601207	That ain't right.
602168	603249	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
620126	624708	I think for just like a good little chill out game, five bucks is not asking too much.
624908	633150	And yeah, despite my little issue with the 50 gamer score for free, it is a feel good thing that you can do like, hey, I bought this game and the money's going to charity.
633190	633911	So that's pretty cool.
634491	634591	So...
636733	638875	That was pretty much my gaming week, all things considered.
638935	641457	So those are pretty much the games I was playing.
641738	642719	How about you guys in chat?
642759	643699	How was your gaming week?
644380	647603	Some guys in chat kind of talking about the charity thing I was just talking about.
648163	656351	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com Kevin DDR in chat says, Only thing that irritated me was the different choice of pieces on different songs.
656651	660034	I think that something that fundamental to the gameplay strategy would stay consistent.
660454	660815	Interesting.
661536	668122	Kevin DDR also said, I assumed achievements generally got the amount of points based on the relative difficulty of the achievement.
668442	670925	I guess, unfortunately, some developers don't want to do that.
671005	676851	Very good point, because that 50 gamerscore achievement is like the biggest one in that game, because they only have 200 to work with.
677371	682677	And the rest of the achievements are, some of them are fairly difficult, at least from the little bit I played.
683297	683397	So...
684358	684738	There you go.
684758	688199	Some comments from chat.orangeloungeradio.com Some housekeeping tonight.
688219	690760	Of course, we always like to plug our Twitter and our Facebook.
691261	694802	www.twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us on Twitter.

717888	718529	Thank you for watching!
737290	766193	We want to thank the community at AllGames.com www.AllGames.com It's All Games Radio and it's the place where we do tape our show live every Sunday night and as I always say on the show if you don't like what you hear from us maybe one of the other shows on the network is more your cup of tea because as mentioned before, I think Jamie mentioned everybody she knows is playing Mass Effect 2 but we're all sitting here going, well we just really haven't been playing that because I've been too busy playing Bayonetta and Raiding and DarkSakura's been too busy playing Star Trek Online and
766573	791512	Shooting Klingons But I'm sure there's lots of other shows where they're talking about Mass Effect 2 non-stop So if that's more your cup of tea, hey, cool But if you do like our show, one last little plug Please visit iTunes, search for Orange Launch Radio And leave us a nice little review iTunes, by the way, recently changed the podcast page format To kind of match the rest of the CDs and things in the marketplace So if you go visit Orange Launch Radio You can see the most popular shows in our feed and so forth Although...
791912	821160	I think it's a little early to really be tracking those type of statistics but I thought it was neat you can see the little cover arts of the shows that it suggests like people who listen to Orange Lounge Radio also like and it shows all the little cover art you know who the number one show is that suggested people who also listen to Orange Lounge Radio also like you know what the number one show is in the list any guesses do tell Bobby Blackwolf our good pal Bobby is the number one suggestion of course he is because you know we're on right back to back on all games radio I'm sure we're number one on his list too
821932	844011	Alright, also getting information from our chatroom, www.orangelantradio.com, click on chat or you can go to chat.orangelantradio.com TigerClaw says, hey this just in, Dante's Inferno ad just played during the fourth quarter, because they're watching the Super Bowl right now With the tagline, Hell Awaits, which if I remember right, wasn't there some controversy that they weren't going to air that promo?
844031	846614	They just made them edit it so it wasn't saying go to hell
847294	870354	I see, that's right, it was gonna say go to hell, now it's hell awaits Who cares, it doesn't matter A little weird I did play the demo for that game, it was neat It was kind of God of War-ish, but fun Yeah So, not that, I mean, being God of War is not a bad thing Alright, let's get into some gaming news Lots of gaming news this week, surprisingly enough We're really starting to kind of kick into the year And all the game news, and Loki's starting us off with some big news, right?
870374	870434	Yep
870934	874940	Yes, this is, I don't know if it's completely big news.
875000	877985	I mean, kind of, we could have figured this out pretty simple.
878666	883132	Project Needlemouse, you know, the project that they were working on that was a 2D Sonic game.
883753	884354	Well, guess what?
884434	885455	It's Sonic 4.
885896	886637	Oh my God.
887418	889539	That's a surprise, except it's not.
890599	898181	What is kind of unique about it is it's going to be available only as an episodic game, and it's available on all the different download services.
898321	900782	We wear PlayStation Network, Xbox Live.
902822	904382	So that's kind of cool.
905043	911324	And I guess the first episode will be available this summer, and hopefully it's good.
912145	912465	I don't know.
914145	916105	I'm just not that excited about it, that's all.
916765	922727	Is it because maybe there hasn't been like a really, really like OMG, squee in my pants, exciting Sonic game?
922747	927327	Yeah, because they always say, oh, we're gonna do what people wanted us to do, and then they fuck it up somehow.
928087	931188	You know, it's... I don't know.
931208	932768	Some comments in our chat seem to agree.
932868	935849	Ray Ayanami says, can Sega not fuck up Sonic 4?
938969	940850	DarkSakura, I know you're a big Sonic fan girl.
940870	942050	What was your reaction to the trailer?
942310	942570	Squee.
945140	946541	I'm gonna take a cookie.
947381	949042	Yeah, you better eat that last cookie before I do.
951003	952544	But here's, no, no, no, I don't need any more cookies.
952604	966993	But here, I have to admit, even though the trailer didn't show much, I mean, it just kind of showed the whole idea of, hey, we're making a new Sonic game in the original Genesis game canon, which we haven't touched in, what, 15 years, I think?
967533	969434	So, maybe longer than that, I don't know.
969574	970635	But it is the updated model.
970655	970735	Yeah.
971155	995506	right and what I thought was interesting is that you know the little glimpse of gameplay you see was a very Sonic 3 corkscrew looking thing that just looked very souped up in 3D like it's interesting Mega Man 9 has sort of opened the floodgates to this kind of stuff in a way I don't know do you think this was inspired by the success of Mega Man 9 or do you think Sega's just finally getting the hint people just want the old shit with new a new coat of paint or what
996249	1000973	Well, I've noticed, and this is almost with any type of genre, be it art, music, whatever.
1001854	1010141	A lot of times you get this going towards the bigger, the better, the whole, you know, brand new, shiny, 3D, whatever, digital.
1011502	1015946	But there comes a phase in everything that you go back to the old way of doing.
1016587	1020030	You know, you want the classic look, you want the classic play.
1020550	1024554	You know, else we wouldn't have, you know, Sonic 4, we wouldn't have the new Mega Man games.
1025785	1028549	I mean, shoot, even art's done the same thing.
1028629	1036221	Like right after the Victorian age, you know, we, well, kind of around the same time, there were people that were going back to the old handmade way of doing things.
1036762	1038805	So I think it's just culture.
1039406	1039887	It's going to happen.
1039927	1040608	It was bound to happen.
1041092	1042713	History repeats itself kind of thing.
1042953	1043974	Interesting.
1044054	1044794	Some comments in chat.
1044854	1047336	Hitstun says, Well, Sega did a great job with OutRun 2.
1047416	1047956	There is hope.
1049037	1052519	I'm not sure if we're thinking of the same game here, but there was an OutRun game.
1052559	1056402	I don't think it was OutRun 2, but there was an OutRun game on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.
1056722	1057522	Yeah, OutRun 2000.
1057562	1057862	That was it.
1058723	1059583	Not that long ago.
1059724	1060784	And that was kind of cool.
1061124	1061385	Like for a...
1062345	1063666	Dan played the crap out of it.
1063686	1069628	It wasn't like OMG best game ever, but for a little arcade racing game that kind of invoked the old style of OutRun, I enjoyed it.
1069948	1072329	I think I did buy the full version and played it a little bit.
1072349	1072729	It was fun.
1072749	1075070	It had Magical Sound Shower and that's the important thing.
1075130	1075450	It sure did.
1075550	1076610	It was Magical Sound Shower.
1077351	1077651	Let's see.
1078191	1079471	And some other comments in chat room.
1079832	1082673	Frisbee says, I think this is Sega's final try.
1083593	1084453	Interesting comment.
1084473	1088295	Do you think that if this doesn't live up to the hype that Sonic's done?
1088955	1090115	It's a done franchise?
1091116	1091536	Bury it?
1093024	1094245	I think Sonic isn't going to die.
1094865	1096086	No, I don't think Sonic would die either.
1096567	1100749	Something to think about, even if Sonic 4 tanks, which I highly doubt it will.
1100789	1103251	I think they're doing the right thing in invoking the past here.
1103992	1107014	Even if, for whatever crazy ass reason, Sonic 4 tanks.
1107334	1113518	Let's not forget, Mario and Sonic at the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics and all that stuff was huge on the Nintendo Wii.
1113818	1117921	So Sonic as a character I think still has a lot of kind of clout, if you will.
1118422	1118902	It's just that
1119382	1127610	Oddly enough, if Sonic 4 were to tank, which again, I don't think it will Sonic would mainly exist in Nintendo franchises Isn't that weird?
1129278	1132400	I think it's just the way things are going
1159511	1165234	It's going to suck for them because now, since they're not putting out a full retail version, I'm assuming it's going to be cheaper.
1165994	1169836	And if people really hate the game, they're not out as much money.
1170696	1173037	Which is good for the consumer, bad for Sega.
1175100	1184108	Do you think maybe they're just doing this so that by the time they put out Episode 1, Episode 2, Episode 3, they make about as much money as they would have if they just put the game out on DVD, Blu-ray?
1184288	1187911	Pretty much, but that's assuming if everybody buys all the parts to it.
1188672	1189473	I guess that's a good point.
1190253	1192635	All right, chat.orangehauntsradio.com if you want to comment on this.
1192655	1194357	Was there anything else for this story, Loki, you wanted to add?
1195553	1202518	Um, yeah, I was also going to say that, um, one other platform that it's supposed to be coming out on is the iPhone.
1203299	1205661	And that's kind of typical with anything nowadays.
1206101	1208583	Of course, I'm going to assume that this is on the iPhone is going to control like shit.
1210097	1210877	That's just my guess.
1211097	1218460	That is a little weird that it's coming to the iPhone because, you know, I'm not a big fan of all these games getting adapted to the iPhone because the touch thing is a little weird.
1219180	1222001	But, I don't know.
1222041	1232044	Some comments, more comments from our chat room, chat.orangelounge.com Tiger Claw says, the fact that the game is episodic probably means you will have your epic boss battle against Doc Robotnik.
1232365	1233025	Wasn't that a given?
1233045	1237966	Like at the end of every stage you always have to have your, you know, Doc Robotnik battle at the end?
1238006	1238987	That's every stage, right?
1240382	1242223	Oh, TigerClaw says, actually, he's correcting that.
1242263	1245183	You will not have your epic boss battle against Doc Robotnik.
1245524	1249485	So maybe that, like, you have, like, mini-bosses.
1249585	1250505	I don't know how that would work.
1252326	1254986	SSJ100Matt says, it should have Michael Jackson music in it.
1255326	1261908	Well, I don't know if that's going to be very possible at this point, unless they were working in secret, you know, more than a year ago.
1261948	1263449	But I somehow doubt that is the case.
1265034	1269777	Well, I think all of us in studio kind of agree, though, we will pick up Sonic 4, at least check it out.
1270377	1274340	I know I will, because I do love the old Sonic games, and I'm all about checking out the new one.
1274560	1276881	I'm sure, I know Jamie's gonna buy it, I don't even have to ask her.
1277501	1277702	Yeah.
1278042	1279503	Matt, will you buy it?
1280043	1280203	Nope.
1281764	1282184	One holdout.
1282204	1283445	Why not, dare I ask?
1284445	1287447	Because I haven't bought any of the Sonic games, I just don't care.
1288588	1288908	Alright.
1289308	1291530	It's not really a game that I really got into.
1292250	1294492	Well, maybe Loki will care about this.
1294632	1299357	I know I sure did, because I let out the biggest fangirl scream when I saw this.
1299417	1300838	Like, seriously, I'm not even joking.
1301159	1302320	When I saw this last week.
1302400	1304101	Talk about out of right field.
1304181	1305683	Okay, this came out of nowhere.
1306424	1313650	Sunsoft, remember they reformed not that long ago, announced that Blaster Master Overdrive is on its way out.
1313750	1317434	That's right, a remade new version of Blaster Master, although...
1317934	1320196	I do not believe this is like a remake.
1320357	1323259	It is actually a sequel of the NES classic.
1323279	1327703	We're just kind of forgetting that, you know, Blaster Master 2 on Genesis and the Game Boy One never happened.
1328004	1334349	But this is the sequel to Blaster Master will be coming out on WiiWare for 1,000 Wii points.
1334770	1337592	Here's what I think is the biggest twist out of this whole thing.
1338053	1340935	They said, oh yeah, and the game, it's coming out Monday.
1340955	1341035	Okay.
1341756	1370346	as in tomorrow as in we've kept this a secret for however long we've been working on this and hey now it's out now you can buy it and there's even a little trailer out there that shows some of the gameplay I'm playing a little bit of it in studio because great awesome enough it has a remixed version of the theme I don't like the remix version of the theme they kind of like fucked it up you know what nothing is ever going to be as good as the original that's really what it is I don't like this one at all but this is not bad it could have been a lot worse
1372964	1374444	But you can definitely see it's 16x9.
1375065	1377265	The overhead stages look a lot different.
1379266	1384948	I don't know, this game just kind of has more of a Metroid look to it, which I'm all over that.
1386288	1386968	That's pretty sweet.
1387568	1395971	Yeah, it's like some of these overhead levels have ice themes and more cavern themes, whereas I don't remember that being the case in the first one.
1400935	1401676	DarkSakura.com
1424557	1430746	Yeah, maybe, they'll probably be up Dan's alley Now, Loki, which would you rather play, Sonic 4 or Blaster Master Overdrive?
1430806	1436294	Blaster Master Oh, okay I had to ask, I had to DarkSakura, what do you got?
1436758	1438480	Well, it was bound to happen.
1438520	1442084	I think that it was expected maybe sooner rather than now.
1442544	1447569	But Xbox Live is going to be canceling out support for the original console.
1448090	1450192	And that's going into effect on April 15th.
1450913	1458240	And it's also not just the console, but for games that are compatible with both the 360 and the old Xbox.
1458941	1459141	So...
1461129	1471168	and basically saying that because more people now are really on Xbox 360 that that's what they want to focus their power on and cut the support so they can focus more fully on the newer system.
1472864	1473244	Halo 2 Halo 3 Halo 2
1498410	1506341	well they're saying also that the other big thing is that the changes that they want to make to the service are as I say incompatible with the original games with the old games
1506772	1507292	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1531332	1558682	so that's one of the big things that getting rid of the original Xbox games and shutting down Halo 2 and so forth will free up and I would say by the end of the year probably whenever the patch comes out for Natal your friends list is going to get a big bump and you'll be able to have 250, 500, maybe even unlimited friends I don't know and I'm sure there are some other technical components that we're just not aware of because we haven't thought of them yet but there's some other things that they have to shut off these games for
1559349	1580502	but on the flip side there's a lot of as you can understand ticked off people still playing the original Xbox still playing Halo 2 haven't upgraded Xbox 360 yet that are very sad about this news what do you guys think too bad so sad it's time to give it up and put it away or do they do they make a case maybe Microsoft needs to find a way to still support this
1581222	1581863	Who cares?
1582763	1585405	I mean, seriously, how many people are still playing the original Xbox?
1585725	1587086	Upgrade, get a new system.
1587146	1590409	I mean, it's bound to happen that they're going to shut off servers.
1590469	1595752	I mean, just because you're paying for it now, okay, great, that you're paying for it month to month.
1595973	1597974	Well, now you're not.
1598334	1600456	So, I don't know.
1600976	1602577	I don't really feel sad about these people.
1603718	1631770	I do find it strange okay the original Xbox games couldn't be patched or whatever I get that but I do find it strange that Microsoft won't find a way to still let Halo 2 be playable on the 360 you know what I mean like via a patch or via you know because Halo 2 is an on-demand game it's a download game so that you could fix it so that you could still play it on Xbox 360 at least you know fix whatever is the problem with the friends list and play it that way you would think they would do that but they're not
1632330	1657514	Tiger Claw does bring up a good point though in our chat room, chat.orangelawntrader.com People can still play Halo 2 multiplayer if they get the PC version So, you know, Halo 2 is not forgotten for everybody Let's see, Hitstun in our chat says if you have an original Xbox and it's not modded, it's time to mod it And that also makes me think of the fact that, you know, you could also go the way of the original Halo And if you really want to play your Halo 2 or your Halo, it's time to break out the LAN party
1658973	1660055	You know, we still do that sometimes.
1660475	1660676	Yeah?
1660896	1663039	Yeah, we would have the TVs all over the house.
1664141	1665302	Actually, I'll tell you what's funny.
1665382	1673354	Dan's bachelor party was really a bunch of people over playing all the systems all land.
1674625	1678070	GameGuru in chat is correcting me that Halo 2 isn't a game on demand.
1678110	1678470	My bad.
1678790	1679832	I assumed that it was.
1679872	1681834	I guess Halo 1 is, but not Halo 2.
1682675	1683036	My bad.
1684177	1690125	Well, okay, but let me just say to that then, okay, make it a game on demand and make it so that it works.
1690325	1691307	Seems a little strange to me.
1692027	1718872	X-Link in our chatroom says EA does it all the time That's true, EA shuts down servers for old games And we kind of go, well, they're old There's new versions of the game out And sure enough, there is Halo 3 and Halo ODST out at this point I did like what Sega did when they closed the PSO servers Is that for the people that were running private servers They actually gave them a way to transfer characters and things
1719332	1737849	and I would think that if people are actually still playing that then there should be some other way to host your own server for it or something and have that be like an external for some reason I don't see Microsoft supporting that out of the companies like I could see why Sega would do that but I could see why Microsoft would not if that makes sense
1738589	1765716	and SJ100 Matt in our chatroom says in the end nothing lasts forever and I guess that's another point as well is that hey you know that game you got a good six or seven year run out of it right no no wait I'm saying too much that's how long Xbox Live has been around Halo 2 has probably been going what about four or five years about it came out while we were doing this show I played Halo 1 for the first time and we were on the air so it's been around for five years five years that's a pretty good run
1767603	1772227	GameGuru in chat says, Microsoft will more than likely make Halo 2 an Xbox Live Arcade title, if anything.
1772287	1772827	I could see that.
1773508	1773888	I could see that.
1773908	1774489	That'd be kind of cool.
1774509	1775930	That would be kind of cool, actually.
1775950	1777191	That might actually bring me back to Halo 2.
1777951	1778251	I don't know.
1778632	1780313	Especially with some souped up graphics and so forth.
1780353	1781694	But, oh well.
1782735	1784897	I think, again in chat, you said it good.
1785017	1786238	Nothing lasts forever.
1786438	1789721	And someday they're going to shut down the servers for all the games we're playing today.
1790541	1793263	Probably in five years when we've moved on to the Xbox 720s and so forth.
1794444	1795385	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1821195	1823796	There's TVs all over the house.
1823856	1828398	Like a TV on the kitchen table, a TV in the living room, a TV everywhere.
1828478	1830639	And they all had Nintendos hooked up.
1831520	1833641	And I was like, what the hell is going on here?
1834101	1837322	And Jamie's like, they're having a LAN party, a local area Nintendo party.
1838403	1842104	All these TVs had Nintendo systems hooked up and they were playing The Legend of Zelda.
1842505	1847167	And I guess they were having a contest to see who could beat The Legend of Zelda first.
1848047	1850528	and some people were like already on the seventh dungeon.
1850549	1852069	Like I think your husband was really far ahead.
1852189	1853550	Yeah, I think Dan actually won that one.
1853570	1854130	I'm sure he did.
1854451	1855871	And some people were still struggling.
1855891	1859874	They were on like dungeon three and some people were in the overworld so I couldn't really tell where they were at.
1860254	1864116	But I just remember thinking, that is the fucking coolest thing I've ever seen.
1864496	1869199	Like I was like, Jamie and I are going to get along just fine because this had to be about a year before we started OLR.
1869259	1875002	I mean it was a while before OLR but I just remember thinking, wow, this is all kinds of awesome.
1876529	1895368	I kind of miss that house except I don't miss where it was yeah so anyway I just wanted to tell that story if you never heard it before here on the show because I always think that's hilarious and I would love nothing more than to see another LAN party happen somewhere somehow I think that would be a lot of fun so if there's ever if Dan ever decides he's doing another Nintendo party I want in
1896269	1897470	I have to bring my FC Mobile.
1898371	1902815	Keep in mind, though, we probably got three other NESs, and you have an NES.
1902855	1904076	Oh, that's right, I do have the NES.
1904116	1906098	I do have that, but I don't have a Zelda cart, but we can get one.
1906438	1908160	Like, I've got like three of them hanging around somewhere.
1908641	1909521	I love that.
1909601	1913185	One of the batteries, I think, finally died in one of them, but we've also got Zelda 2.
1913825	1917829	Those batteries were only guaranteed to last like five years, but most of them have lasted like 20.
1918069	1918349	Yeah.
1918830	1919591	That's pretty crazy.
1920391	1921472	Alright, anyhow, sorry guys.
1921972	1924312	Got a little tangent, but that happens here on this show sometimes.
1925013	1926773	Loki, bring us back with some more gaming news.
1927674	1927874	Yes.
1929254	1939558	So, you know, Facebook's been getting a lot of games recently, and a lot of them have been pretty basic, and they're starting to get some better stuff, like with the new Civilization game and whatnot.
1940018	1943419	But now they're actually getting a first-person shooter game.
1944039	1947200	This game's called Brave Arms, and it actually looks kind of cool.
1947260	1948001	Kind of like a...
1949261	1952643	I don't know if the Quake Online stuff, like Quake Zero or whatever.
1953203	1954624	But it's pretty cool.
1954664	1956565	It's from 3G Studios.
1957626	1961148	And apparently it's set to come out in March.
1962268	1965470	And it's kind of similar to a Doom, Quake, Halo, Call of Duty.
1966811	1966971	But...
1968752	1969693	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1988450	1989331	Patent pending.
1989411	1990051	Patent pending.
2013314	2014935	Loki, would you play a game like that for free?
2015195	2016895	I think I'd check it out at least.
2017176	2021317	I played Quake Live.
2021697	2023558	I played that for a little bit when it first came out.
2023618	2027660	I thought it was cool because it was based off Quake 3, which was like the best freaking Quake they ever did.
2028660	2029960	In fact, somebody in chat agrees with me.
2030441	2030761	Let's see.
2030821	2031361	Who is it?
2031741	2036323	Ah yes, ZenthralZen says, Quake 3 Arena, best LAN party game ever, period.
2037404	2039645	It was one of the best over the internet games too.
2039665	2040845	It was a lot of fun to play.
2041585	2042346	I had a good time with that one.
2043446	2048388	We'll see how this Facebook game goes, but I'm telling you guys, this is the direction gaming's moving.
2048769	2051890	Facebook as a platform for gaming.
2052690	2057953	Pretty soon you're going to be talking Xbox 360, Wii, PS3, PC, and Facebook gaming.
2058033	2058473	Oh, and iPhones.
2058493	2059474	You've got to throw that in there too.
2060074	2062155	Facebook is like a serious platform for gaming.
2064877	2065437	Believe it or not.
2066504	2069825	One thing to take very seriously, as a lot of people do, is World of Warcraft.
2069865	2072806	And some people take the auction house dealings very seriously.
2072846	2076647	In fact, some people kind of play the economy as like the game.
2077067	2082988	Like, I don't really get into the whole auction house dealings, so I'm not sure exactly what they do, but I guess it's kind of like the stock market.
2083368	2089930	You buy items that are plentiful, and then when they're not available, you sell them at a high profit, is basically what it is.
2090390	2095013	Well, people that play World of Warcraft for the auctions and for the markets are in for a big surprise.
2095354	2096134	Because guess what?
2096194	2109144	Apparently, Blizzard has announced this week that soon you are going to be able to manage your auctions from World of Warcraft using the Armory application on the iPhone or iPod Touch.
2110253	2112775	We don't know much about exactly how this will work yet.
2112816	2122945	We don't know the specifics like can you access your in-game mail too because that's the only way you get the money from your auctions or how would you post something if you can't access your character's bags or what have you.
2123226	2124927	We don't know the answer to all the specifics yet.
2124947	2130372	We just know that Blizzard is throwing out that idea of you could play the economical game of World of Warcraft on the go.
2131033	2131433	Interesting.
2131793	2136755	But of course, one thing they are saying with this as well is that it will cost money.
2136815	2139436	It's going to be a premium-based service.
2139577	2142318	They've said premium-based, which you know that means cost money.
2143018	2150981	Don't know if that'll be a monthly thing that you add on for your character or what I would assume would be the option would be you charge for the app on the iPhone.
2151421	2155343	If you're going to be releasing this on the iPhone, you're going to charge $9.99 for the app or something like that.
2156003	2157244	That's how they will make their money.
2158086	2164835	DarkSakura, I know you're not a big WoW player anymore, but let's say they had an equivalent in Star Trek Online, or let's imagine you did still play WoW.
2164875	2166697	Do you think this is the kind of thing you'd be interested in?
2167551	2171233	As long as it's free But it's not, so you wouldn't pay a premium for it?
2171533	2180396	No, I wouldn't Then again, this is the person who just bought, you know, a thousand cryptic points Why do you think someone would be into this?
2180456	2196283	Why do you think someone would say, hey, because I'm looking at this going, you know, as awesome as this feature sounds And depending on the cost, I might just, like if it is just like five bucks for the app, I might just buy it to check it out I don't see myself really using it, like it's kind of weird to be using that on the phone
2196383	2202427	I was trying to look at the page for the interface and everything.
2202547	2203367	Well, they don't have that yet.
2203407	2205729	It's all they've said now is an announcement.
2205789	2211032	I used the Armory itself, but I don't know.
2211072	2212733	I'm not that obsessed about the games I play.
2212933	2213473	I mean, really.
2214294	2215194	It's something for addicts.
2216835	2222919	Loki, I know you're not a big MMO player anymore, but let's assume this was five years ago and this was a Final Fantasy XI auction house app.
2223059	2223660	What do you think?
2224600	2227162	Well, it's an app for an iPhone or something like that, right?
2227702	2231304	Well, yeah, but let's say it was something you could access on the web too or something, I don't know.
2232245	2232405	No.
2233006	2233186	No?
2233646	2234146	Not for you?
2234286	2234727	Not for me.
2235427	2236508	That's why I go into game.
2238029	2238449	Good point.
2239009	2247755	I have to admit, although I might be willing to kind of check it out just for the sake of checking it out, I don't know if I'd want to pay a monthly fee just to manage my auctions.
2247975	2251538	I mean, that's kind of what... And the other thing that kind of worries me
2252458	2261601	This is like my one little weird worry and I don't know maybe the chatters can tell me if I'm being irrational with this but I kind of always thought this was how a lot of the gold farmers made their money.
2262441	2273144	So by kind of allowing folks to do this without being actually in the game could you possibly be encouraging the gold farming community and the people that are hacking and stealing accounts?
2274084	2277585	Is that an irrational line of thought or do I have a legitimate concern there?
2278925	2279265	I don't know.
2280426	2280866	You tell me.
2280946	2285008	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com We'll get to some of that feedback in just a moment.
2285028	2286269	But we'll move on with the news for now.
2287490	2288050	DarkSakura.
2289331	2294934	Now, you remember when we were talking about Akira Yamaoka leaving Konami?
2295905	2296886	Well, we know where he ended up.
2297527	2309781	He's with Grasshopper Manufacture and is supposed to be doing music for an upcoming horror game that they're doing that's produced by Shinji Mikami.
2310662	2310742	Um...
2312183	2325158	So, maybe it's going to be going back to, you know, more of the, a game that has the feel of the older Silent Hill, you know, not necessarily the kind of Americanized ones now, you know what I mean?
2326019	2332466	But just if it puts anything in perspective, Grasshopper did Fatal Frame 4 and No More Heroes 2, so...
2334294	2338076	Did you know that they have the translation project for Fatal Frame 4?
2338736	2342578	Yeah, I think we covered that a few weeks ago, probably about a month ago on the show.
2342618	2343118	Yeah, I remember that.
2343138	2345659	So I think that's pretty cool.
2345679	2353282	If that's the kind of game he's going to work on, then perhaps it's a worthy thing that he's jumped ship.
2353843	2361706	I don't know where I read this, and it's probably just one of those fan wank rumors, I don't know, but I had heard that EA was courting Akira Yamaoka.
2362509	2365510	Well, EA is producing the game that Grasshopper's working on.
2365850	2366250	I see.
2366310	2369492	Maybe it was kind of jumping to conclusions type of thing.
2369752	2370312	Possibly.
2370812	2371232	That could be.
2371252	2379355	I mean, maybe this would lead to Akira Yamaoka getting to do whatever Silent Hill-y horror game I'm sure EA would be more than happy to publish.
2379775	2380916	Oh, I wouldn't doubt that at all.
2380936	2381336	Yeah.
2382016	2382396	Interesting.
2384437	2386258	I mean, that man is pretty much Silent Hill.
2387469	2394094	Going back to the chatroom, chat.orangelearnersradio.com and some of the comments from the auction app for WoW.
2394434	2399358	SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom says, I bet there will be an auction house app for Final Fantasy XIV.
2399758	2405663	You know, it will be interesting to see how Squeenix kind of embraces all this stuff that WoW is doing.
2405863	2410547	I noticed for XI, especially towards the end, they tried to do some...
2411267	2412389	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2433691	2434951	Let's see other comments from chat room.
2435472	2436973	Xlink says, I'm not buying it.
2437793	2442116	And it also says that he thought of the same thing that I was mentioning with the gold farmers.
2442597	2444858	And that's why he's not using it.
2445999	2448000	Also was a quick shout out there from HitStun.
2448020	2450682	Does Dissida have any Final Fantasy XI characters?
2451183	2455265	SSJ100Mac clarifying, yes, there's a quick cameo of a Final Fantasy XI character.
2455746	2458348	Final Fantasy XI is tricky to do because...
2459048	2461389	There was no standard hero.
2461790	2466953	You were the hero and you could look a variety of different ways, you know, because you could customize your character.
2466973	2469935	Although everyone had the same outfit over and over and over and over.
2470195	2470555	For real.
2470575	2472136	I mean, the customization was very limited.
2472236	2475798	I did like, so seeing the male characters walking around in their leather mantis.
2476179	2476839	Yes, yes.
2476879	2478260	There was always a, what were they called?
2478840	2482262	The bronze, or whatever.
2482282	2485064	Yeah, it looked like mantis, basically, who was running around and it was really funny.
2485084	2487165	With a harness.
2487506	2487726	Yes.
2487746	2487906	Yes.
2490207	2496232	Let's... But some of like maybe the boss characters and some of the NPCs that you interact with I could see being in the game.
2496252	2497533	I think that's what they were talking about.
2497893	2498393	I'm sure it is too.
2498413	2499994	S2100Mac clarifies it's a TaruTaru.
2500775	2500895	Which...
2501474	2502755	It's one of the characters that's in the game.
2502775	2505756	Doesn't surprise me at all, because Tarotaro is what everybody remembers.
2506176	2510858	And even in Final Fantasy XIV, they're going to have Tarotaros, but they're not calling them Tarotaros.
2511679	2512559	Yeah, that's retarded.
2512599	2513439	Which is so weird to me.
2513579	2515380	It is absolutely retarded.
2515520	2516361	Hey, whatever.
2516481	2518341	As long as the game is good, I don't care.
2518422	2521323	Call them Sexy Chocolate for all I care.
2521383	2522543	Sexy Chocolate?
2522563	2523884	That's awesome.
2523944	2526105	I'm going to roll a Sexy Chocolate White Mage.
2530239	2531580	I don't know how that works, but...
2557343	2559225	Oh god, we need to do some release dates.
2559305	2561126	Quick, please, change the topic, help.
2561827	2571815	Okay, well this isn't anything to do with sexy chocolate, but I guess since next week is Valentine's week, and I guess it could be sexy chocolate.
2572215	2581422	If you're into that kind of thing for Dante's Inferno, because nothing says sexy chocolate like tortured souls in hell, uh...
2582823	2584405	Star Ocean Last Hope International Edition
2607044	2622864	Family Party, 30 Great Games, Winter Fun, yet another party game compilation for the Wii World Cup of Pool, coming to the DS Shirin the Wanderer, coming to the Wii, which looks pretty awesome, that's from Atlus
2623645	2632251	and, of course, the big one for the week, Bioshock 2, making its way out on PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.
2632872	2637796	Or, if you're a teenage girl, perhaps seeing Twilight is the big game for you this week.
2638216	2639397	That will be out on the DS.
2643339	2649321	If you want none of those or just own a Wii, then perhaps Super Monkey Ball Step and Roll will be your type of game.
2649581	2651741	And that's coming out just on the Wii.
2652001	2661723	Loki, you know how much it would amuse me, especially for the YouTube channel, if we were to follow you with a camera to one of those midnight releases for Dante's Inferno or Bioshock 2, because they're both coming out at the same time, right?
2662083	2664924	And then you walk up to the counter and ask for a scene at Twilight.
2665544	2666164	I would love that.
2666184	2668445	Except I wouldn't want to do that.
2669085	2684254	by the way the reason why that's called the Divine Edition is because the Inferno was part of the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri so that's why it's called the Divine Version there you go which I've read that in 5th grade
2685153	2691618	I thought it was called the Divine Edition because it's like, you know, Sony's way of saying, hey, look, we have something exclusive.
2692378	2700764	Ah, we may have lost Final Fantasy, you know, 13 and, you know, Residents of Fate and all the other games that have come out.
2700825	2702766	But hey, we still got the Divine Edition.
2703246	2705568	You're not gonna be able to get that download content until later.
2706028	2708430	They're just trying to be all literary and cultured and shit.
2708570	2713552	I thought they called it the Divine Edition because the Sexy Chocolate Edition just got rejected is what it was.
2715512	2715752	Fail.
2716152	2716453	All right.
2717073	2719373	Hey, some other release dates for Japan.
2720394	2722374	Game coming out on the Xbox 360 this week.
2722494	2726816	Sacred 2 Fallen Angel makes its way to Japan this week.
2726856	2728696	And I'm trying to see what kind of game this is.
2728856	2730377	It's a role-playing game.
2730797	2733700	Well, okay, I can see that, but I'm trying to figure out what more about this.
2733760	2736522	Is this like a Final Fantasy-ish kind of game?
2736802	2739645	The graphics look interesting, kind of like in a desert.
2739705	2740866	It came out here last year.
2740906	2741426	It sucked.
2742467	2742787	All right.
2743168	2745590	Oh, there's like a not-Chocobo in the game there that you can ride.
2745890	2747491	They don't localize this for the U.S., though, right?
2747511	2748732	It's a Boca Cho.
2749393	2749913	Yeah.
2750354	2753156	One of the reviews, though, I'm reading online, this game is massive.
2753196	2755038	There's tons of quests, and the level cap is 200.
2755098	2755939	Who knows, though?
2755959	2757060	That was probably written by the publisher.
2758320	2785493	if you don't want to play that on the Xbox 360 you could check it out on PlayStation 3 because it's coming out there too as well as a game called Winter Sports 2010 The Great Tournament I'm assuming that's like coming from a company who didn't get the Olympic license but wants to cash in on it anyway so there you go if you want you can check out on the Nintendo Wii Mad World makes its way for Japan this week that is a Japanese localized release on the Nintendo Wii this week coming from Sega
2786413	2814601	and unfortunately a lot of folks passed here but maybe if it does very well in Japan there'll still be a sequel so you might want to consider picking that up on the Nintendo DS this week Mina no Konveni comes out this week and it is a strategy based game but when I say that it looks like a little girl going cooking it's not cooking mama but kind of like cafeteria managing maybe kind of a version of Diner Dash I don't know kind of what it strikes me as from the pictures I see there
2815241	2820965	Quickly taking a look at the PSP, Shin Sangoku Musou Multirade gets a price reduction.
2821005	2823707	That game is already out, but it's getting a little price cut this week.
2824408	2825949	It's Dynasty Warriors Strike Force.
2826309	2828431	That's what you might know the game better as.
2828991	2830452	Those are your Japanese release dates.
2831633	2833675	DarkSakura, what's going on overseas in the UK?
2833695	2834115	The other way.
2834375	2836398	Well, for the UK, we've got a few goodies.
2837660	2840965	We have Bioshock 2 on the 9th and on the 10th, Darwinia.
2842007	2850019	And the 12th is Bleach the Third Phantom, Half-Minute Hero, Phantasy Star Zero, Star Ocean, The Last Hope, and Super Monkey Ball Step and Roll.
2853081	2853401	Alrighty.
2854462	2854702	Cool.
2856043	2858064	Um, so this is kind of interesting.
2858484	2865989	Apparently there is a developer resume, um, that's hinting at an Xbox 360 version of Final Fantasy 14.
2866990	2874274	And, um, apparently also this is, uh, was being, uh, removed a few hours later.
2875315	2875835	And, um,
2876935	2888699	Apparently this profile that was on a website linked in for designer Yuki Akama referenced work on Final Fantasy XIV for PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.
2889079	2895241	Of course, only the PC and PS3 platforms have been officially confirmed to be coming out.
2896081	2901444	And not only that, but Sony took great pride in last year's E3 at saying you can only play this on the PlayStation 3.
2902785	2908048	And leading many folks to question if the Xbox Live hurdle proved to be too much for Squeenix to deal with.
2908508	2910309	Although I'm sure Microsoft doesn't want to lose that.
2910810	2914252	I'm sure we'll hear whether it's coming out on the 360 or not.
2916573	2917834	Earlier this week I thought it was.
2918214	2920335	Now, you ever use the website LinkedIn, Matt?
2920635	2920736	No.
2921116	2925538	It's kind of like a professional Facebook, I think is the best way I can describe it.
2925838	2938226	I have a profile on there, and basically it's kind of like a place where you can post your resume and do job searches, but it's supposed to be a way to professionally connect with your coworkers and people they know and so forth.
2939266	2943529	It's more like a professional LinkedIn, and there are quite a few of the gaming community uses that.
2943869	2947471	I've connected with quite a few other podcast hosts and so forth on LinkedIn.
2947971	2974834	I'm sure it will come out on 360 it only makes sense I mean more people that they can get on the service the better it is for them so I don't see why they wouldn't it just seems weird to me that Sony was so excited about it and then just to lose this again you know because this would be twice in a row with the whole Final Fantasy 13 thing going to Xbox that's gonna be a blow to the ego um we'll see like I said um
2975566	2976146	I think a version of...
2993331	2998714	I think a version on the 360 could be eventually, but it would seem like that might come out later.
2998954	3006018	And here's the other thing, Squeenix doesn't seem to think that Final Fantasy will do well on 360 in Japan.
3006058	3012021	Keep in mind, Final Fantasy 13, not happening on the 360 in Japan, or hasn't happened yet because the game's already out there.
3012861	3021927	Maybe the same type of thing is happening where they're going to release Final Fantasy XIV on the 360 here in America and only here and maybe Europe too.
3023648	3029611	But maybe they don't want to hold up the debut of the game to make the 360 version.
3029792	3030392	Does that make sense?
3030652	3032733	Because they're going to do a worldwide launch this time.
3033434	3035455	XI took like a year to get localized over here.
3035715	3038397	But maybe Final Fantasy XIV they're going to throw it out there all at once.
3038497	3040698	Japan, US, and Europe.
3040838	3041759	Everybody gets it at once.
3042360	3043621	And there'll be a 360 version someday.
3043662	3046466	Wouldn't it be hilarious if it became a 360 exclusive?
3046967	3047988	Nah, no way.
3048830	3049210	No way.
3049310	3050452	It would be hilarious, though.
3050632	3056942	Just considering how, you know, Final Fantasy XI was really created as a PS2 game.
3057543	3085731	it was really made for the Playstation 2 I know a lot of us here in the states played it on the PC but part of the reason that game was so limited and finally outgrew itself and couldn't expand the way that WoW has continued to expand is because it's limited to the PS2 and that's why Final Fantasy 11 is kind of they're not going to really support that as much anymore I'm sure it will always be alive there will always be people playing Final Fantasy 11 but it's going to downsize big time when 14 comes out
3088899	3089519	We'll see what happens
3113172	3116374	is going to be announced at the Game Developers Conference.
3116854	3121977	And that's in a story that was run by the website VideoGamer.com from an industry source.
3123017	3129741	An employee at a major international publisher, obviously anonymous as you can imagine, quote, just heard a rumor that you may be interested in.
3130081	3133663	Nintendo are going to announce a new platform at GDC.
3134143	3136325	Some devs have already started work on it.
3137345	3141367	So we don't know if that could be a redone handheld.
3141407	3148630	I mean, I think we've already heard rumblings of a DS2, even though there's the XL still has yet to come out here in the US.
3148650	3150031	We've heard rumblings of a DS2.
3150631	3153873	Some fanboys are hoping it's finally the Wii HD already.
3154973	3155814	Who knows what it could be?
3155874	3158396	Could it maybe be an enhancement to the existing Wii?
3158476	3161358	Like, I don't want to joke the Vitality Sensor, but something in that vein?
3163379	3164540	Probably nothing like that.
3164740	3166241	I don't know if they would do another Wii.
3166622	3169284	I mean, because it's selling like hotcakes right now.
3169404	3170244	What would be the point?
3171045	3176909	You know, trying to put some now I'd see maybe another handheld system because maybe that's starting to slow down a little bit.
3177710	3179411	But I doubt they would be doing a Wii.
3179960	3187505	They're going to build one that you implant into your brain so you can just play until you have seizures.
3187765	3208998	Unless they're trying to stay ahead, they're worried that maybe once these other motion controllers come out for Microsoft and PlayStation 3 and Sony, that you're going to have an even playing field and then they're going to just fail based on the quality of their product because now you're going to have these really pretty looking games that control just like they do on the Wii
3209838	3217483	and people are going to be more apt to maybe buying those, which I don't think that's true, but maybe they're just trying to stay one step ahead.
3217763	3220405	So I don't know.
3220465	3223887	Either way, I'm not too excited about it.
3224127	3229290	In our chat room at chat.org.com, MaginamiCon, I hope I said that right, says, what, a phone?
3230791	3231531	The end phone?
3231571	3232192	Could that happen?
3233633	3236334	I somehow doubt that, but that would be an interesting idea, sure.
3236354	3236975	Yeah.
3238777	3242459	Interesting too, I kind of want to say, if this is true, I don't think it's true.
3243019	3249342	I think some things might happen behind closed doors at Game Developers Conference, but I don't think you're going to see the major announcement until E3.
3249742	3252143	Game Developers Conference is not a media show.
3252283	3255384	It doesn't strike me as the place to announce a new platform.
3255904	3264128	The place to announce maybe a revision, I could see like a DSi XL or something there, even though it's already out in Japan, but you know what I mean, like a slightly altered version.
3264628	3266629	An enhancement or a new tool
3267789	3277374	I could see more Natal information coming out of GDC and some of the things that enhance gaming, but I don't see a full-on new platform being announced at Game Developers Conference.
3277414	3278434	It's not a media show.
3278634	3280595	It's for game developers.
3280655	3281355	It's in the title.
3281656	3286138	I know people think it's a media show and it's turning into one, but it's not supposed to be.
3286158	3286998	It's really, really not.
3287078	3288619	And I think a lot of people resent that it is.
3289279	3299646	So I think if Nintendo is going to make an announcement, which I think it is the DS, I think the DS is going to get the revamp, you're going to see it at E3, not a Game Developers Conference.
3299946	3311734	And yes, I know it is weird that I'm talking the DS revamp when we don't even have the XL here in the West, but I think Nintendo kind of knows that they could still put out the XL in limited quantities and it would sell if it was cheaper.
3312094	3331458	it would still sell to the 7 and 8 year olds and the mothers that like to play Pokemon and whatever, the soccer moms and whatever new DS system that will be $50 more expensive maybe even $100 more expensive will cater to the hardcore gamer who wants their Mario and Zelda games ASAP, right?
3331478	3333339	I don't know, does that seem far-fetched to you guys?
3335119	3335179	no
3336590	3349138	Alright, let's see I'm sorry I can't be too contrary about that And some other comments in chat here Talking about MotionPlus, there's a couple people bringing up MotionPlus Like, was MotionPlus a flop?
3349158	3351960	I don't know, that's a good question Was MotionPlus a flop?
3352000	3353942	What do you think, Loki, from your perspective in sales?
3354422	3361967	Just that people, as far as rental stores and stuff go They don't want to bring in games that have MotionPlus Because they're afraid that people don't have it
3362427	3364088	It's kind of like the whole Guitar Hero thing.
3364128	3368829	People don't want to bring it in because they're afraid that, you know, oh, it requires this.
3368969	3370470	It's not something that most people have.
3371550	3372130	Is it a flop?
3372170	3376511	I don't know if people are really all excited that, oh, God, this game has MotionPlus now.
3376551	3377252	It's going to be better.
3377812	3379672	I don't really think it means anything yet.
3379853	3383194	I mean, there's only been a few games that have actually used it.
3384094	3386355	And I'm sure they're pretty good.
3386635	3390136	It's just it's not, like, game-changing or anything.
3390156	3390236	Yeah.
3391276	3393638	Interesting comment from Blue Swim in our chatroom.
3393698	3395019	Interesting creative idea.
3395479	3398701	Black Wii with groundbreaking DVD support.
3399842	3400142	I don't know.
3400182	3402023	I don't think anyone's going to care.
3402043	3406205	Most people are moving on to Blu-ray and stuff, and everything's a DVD player nowadays.
3406225	3411289	Yeah, I think that's a creative outside-the-box answer for the topic at hand, but I just lean towards no.
3411609	3412830	I think Loki's right.
3412870	3413910	Everything's a DVD player.
3413930	3416492	DVD players are like $40, probably less than that.
3417172	3418233	It doesn't need a DVD player.
3420043	3424446	It's a creative answer, but maybe a Wii revision with something else.
3424506	3427748	But again, it's going to go the way of MotionPlus.
3427788	3433411	The biggest problem with MotionPlus, it wasn't included with the console to begin with, so people are afraid not everyone has it.
3433831	3436293	It's very hard to launch a peripheral.
3436573	3438774	That's what Natal's uphill battle is going to be.
3439195	3444158	That's why you read these articles and these rumors about the 360 is going to relaunch.
3444558	3449561	It's not a new console per se, but they have to treat Natal like a relaunch of the damn system.
3449901	3450541	Thanks for watching!
3479076	3483101	I don't understand why they need to add on.
3483141	3486805	The only thing I can think of is better graphics maybe soup up the actual processor inside there.
3487445	3494313	Because if they're hitting the limits of what they can do on that system, maybe that would help.
3494473	3500240	But say the DSi for the Wii or something like that.
3501981	3506543	I'm afraid that whatever they do decide to put out is just going to be very gimmicky and stupid.
3507203	3512506	It just gives them an excuse to put out another Mario game, another Metroid game, another Zelda game.
3513386	3515747	And look, oh look, it's new, but it's not.
3515767	3516628	I don't know.
3517697	3521982	Well, we're going to get into the classic game of the week here in just a moment and wrap up part A of our show.
3522042	3524845	But I do want to say hello to all the folks who are tuning in live tonight.
3524865	3526067	I guess the Super Bowl is over.
3526648	3530552	And so now we have some folks kind of coming back to us now that the football game is over.
3530592	3531253	So welcome, guys.
3531593	3532514	Glad you could tune in tonight.
3532555	3535358	I'm just going to recap quickly the things we have talked about tonight.
3535998	3541161	Sorry to the podcast listeners and the folks that listen to us at the top of the show, but I want everyone to know what we've already covered.
3541501	3544983	Sonic the 4 Episode 1 was already announced this week.
3545003	3546843	It was Project Needlemouse's other name.
3547224	3549265	Blaster Master Overdrive has surprised us.
3549305	3550585	It's going to be out on Monday.
3551426	3557228	Xbox and Microsoft is ditching live support for the original Xbox, so Halo 2 fans are pissed.
3557509	3559610	But the rest of us will gain a friends list with more than 100 friends.
3560550	3563852	Facebook is getting a new first-person shooter game called Brave Arms.
3564192	3566113	Facebook is a gaming platform, you betcha.
3566673	3574677	Blizzard has been announcing, teasing the idea of a premium auction house application for World of Warcraft so you can manage your auctions offline.
3575038	3576458	Akira Yamaoka has found a new home.
3576498	3581401	He left Konami a couple months ago and now he's at Grasshopper working with the folks that did No More Heroes.
3581841	3582902	We covered release dates.
3583382	3596171	Final Fantasy XIV, a developer's LinkedIn profile has clued us into the fact that it could be under development for the 360, but we seem to come to a consensus that if it is under development for the 360, it probably won't come out at the same time.
3596491	3598753	And then we just wrapped up talking about a story where Nintendo...
3599353	3600234	DarkSakura.com
3628909	3629631	Ew, it's sticky!
3630091	3633096	And here's a video game that you all should be playing.
3634281	3637263	Let's take a listen to Qbert and the awesome 1982 arcade noises.
3667931	3669692	Oh, nope, he won.
3671033	3672973	And he even got bonuses for the two discs on the side.
3673614	3673794	Yep.
3674654	3676375	I love the little sound that the disc makes.
3678056	3678816	Yeah, that's him cussing.
3678896	3685159	Anyway, so Q-Bert was originally supposed to be a game about Q-Bert's big nose that could shoot projectiles.
3686019	3687600	And he would hop all over a pyramid.
3687620	3689281	It was actually made by Warren Davis.
3689981	3691342	I love the high scoreboard, by the way.
3691362	3691602	Hi there!
3691642	3692183	In big letters.
3692203	3692403	Hi there!
3692423	3693324	Welcome to the Noser Elite!
3716189	3729665	Well, so yeah, it is basically sort of puzzle and hopping around and, you know, the game actually gets really hard because, you know, your first few levels you only change it once and you've got enemies all over the board.
3730767	3730847	Um...
3732589	3735251	Also, then you move on to it changing to two colors.
3735732	3737133	You have to change the entire board.
3737573	3742077	And then it happens that you change to one color, and if you hop back on it, it changes back.
3742917	3747521	And so you have to get them all to match the final new color, and there's ones that change three times if you hop on them.
3747741	3752325	And that's where the game just gets, like, disgustingly annoying.
3752525	3753566	I was really good at this.
3754847	3760512	Actually, I had the Clico version, Clico Vision version for a long time, which I still have.
3760532	3761312	I had the Commodore 64 version.
3763420	3773867	Um, but your, uh, little, uh, enemies are called Quailie, who's the purple snake, and Ugg and Wrongway, these little purple snotty creatures, and Slick and Sam that are the green boogers.
3775469	3775829	And, um...
3779255	3782196	You can ride the little discs up to the top of the pyramid.
3782356	3792519	And if you jump on the pyramid right, not on the pyramid, but on the disc right when one of the enemies are chasing you, or I should say Coily is chasing you, they'll hop off the edge behind you and die.
3793380	3794040	Isn't that great, Rob?
3794591	3794791	Yes.
3796133	3797514	That used to be how you'd have to do it.
3797534	3802439	You'd have to lure them towards a disc and then jump up there.
3802459	3806323	It's kind of like what you were talking about last week during the Classic Game of the Week, which was linked to the past.
3807564	3815051	How you'd have in those dungeons, the guards would charge at you and if you were standing towards the edge, then you'd just run real fast and they'd charge right off the edge into oblivion.
3815892	3816333	It was great.
3816792	3827116	Well, um, the other thing about this, too, though, is that it was, um, produced by Gottlieb, who does a lot of, who did, I should say, a lot of, uh, pinball tables, too.
3828377	3842022	Um, it also, um, the, the guy who developed it, uh, Warren Ellis, uh, Warren Davis, sorry, um, was, uh, the guy who was behind, um, Revolution X, um,
3842142	3846965	and Terminator 2 and Lotto Fun, Joust 2 and Us vs. Them, which is a Laserdisc game.
3847766	3851729	So, he's been in... He was also on an episode of HouseMD.
3851769	3852209	I didn't know that.
3852669	3859774	Anyway, he's, you know, been around, you know, in the industry for a while and brought out some pretty big classics.
3860114	3860735	And then, um...
3863678	3866699	It really is just a very simple little game, but it gets really hard.
3867279	3872161	As far as... There were other games that came out.
3873261	3878283	For Q-Bert itself, it came out on the Odyssey 2, which I have that system as well.
3878323	3879563	The Texas Instruments TI-99.
3879624	3881664	The Commodore VIC-20.
3881684	3884745	The Atari systems.
3885766	3885846	Um...
3887126	3889328	The Atari 5200 version is ass, by the way.
3889989	3891750	Qbert was on everything from the 80s.
3892171	3892491	Everything.
3892511	3892971	Yeah, pretty much.
3893912	3901579	There was also a sequel, an actual sequel called Qbert's Cubes, which... Is not bad.
3901839	3902279	I've played it.
3902459	3903100	It's kind of fun.
3903400	3904361	Yeah, it's kind of fun.
3904761	3908945	Then there was Qbert 3 that came out on the NES, but it was very much like the first one.
3909105	3913029	And there was a Qbert pinball, of course, Gottlieb put out, called Qbert's Quest.
3914230	3914350	And...
3916354	3919457	There was a tabletop electronic game version.
3921739	3922520	All kinds of stuff.
3922720	3934912	There's also a version that was put out by Davis that was called Faster, Harder, More Challenging Qbert and it's actually now out.
3935773	3938095	While he didn't put it into production, it's out for MAME.
3938195	3939737	He released the ROM image.
3940217	3940878	Oh wow, cool.
3941278	3955123	And of course, there's the updated Qbert that was on... Crap, now I can't remember which of the... But it was a 3D Qbert, like a Qbert remix or something.
3955283	3957723	I think there was one on PlayStation, I want to say.
3957984	3958644	I could be wrong.
3960344	3961965	Yeah, there was one on PS3.
3962005	3963805	There was the 3D version of it.
3963865	3964786	It was supposed to be pretty good.
3966550	3977599	You know, I liked Qbert and all, and I would like to see this come out on the game room that Microsoft is doing, but I don't know if it will, because who owns the rights to the Gottlieb games now?
3978240	3979941	Doesn't a board game company own them?
3979981	3981383	Doesn't Hasbro own them or something?
3981783	3982464	Something really weird?
3983204	3983845	Thanks for watching!
4002177	4031185	on the Commodore 64 version there was a mode where you could tilt your joystick 45 degrees so that way you used up, down, left, and right to control and then up went like actually to the upright and you know it made it a lot easier to control on the Commodore 64 trust me because trying to hit diagonal directions can you imagine trying to hit diagonal directions on the Xbox 360 D-pad no thank you hopefully if it does come out in game room you can use buttons for precision hopefully
4031892	4032212	We'll see.
4032572	4034413	Oh, you know what else I remember, Rob?
4034453	4034773	What's that?
4035013	4037113	The Q-Bert cartoon when I was a kid.
4038074	4039074	I had the Q-Bert board game.
4039214	4039814	There was a board game.
4041054	4044975	Actually, somewhere I may not still have it, but I had a Q-Bert plushie.
4045856	4046336	Very cute.
4046816	4047476	With his big nose.
4048216	4052977	Alright, well that's going to bring us to a close of Part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but we are not done yet.
4053017	4055158	We still have Part B coming up after the break.
4055438	4059379	We're going to talk about a new console from Sega, but it's not what you think.

4082748	4093783	Welcome back, everybody, to more of Orange Lounge Radio on this part B of our podcast, episode number 354 for this February the 7th of 2010.
4094223	4096266	It is Super Bowl Sunday here in the States.
4097047	4099190	I don't really watch the game.
4099210	4100231	I'm not really into football.
4100251	4100972	The Super Bowl.
4101112	4104574	But I know a lot of people watch it, so I know it was keeping people away from the show.
4104594	4106596	But now that it's over, you have no excuse.
4106636	4111319	So hopefully, if you're listening live, you are here in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
4112360	4116442	And of course, if you're listening to us on the podcast feed, you should try and make it for a live show sometime.
4116943	4118223	We will be here next Sunday.
4118444	4122626	Next Sunday is Valentine's Day, which is also probably going to keep several people away.
4122987	4129111	But the three of us have arranged plans with our significant others, so we will still be able to be here for the Valentine's Day show.
4129231	4130432	So look forward to that.
4131232	4133775	Anyhow, or as some folks like to call it, Singles Awareness Day.
4133875	4136418	So if you're single, come join the OLR family.
4136438	4138561	We'll make you feel right at home here and talk about games or something.
4138581	4141925	Keep your mind off of what Hallmark wants you to think about all day long.
4142465	4145309	Alright, anyhow, let's get back into some gaming news, huh?
4147069	4149870	All right, let's do some quick, quick news stories, Loki.
4150131	4151311	Yes, this is kind of cool.
4151971	4157533	Now, there will be a Heavy Rain demo coming out on PlayStation 3 soon.
4157593	4163395	It's not scheduled to come out until February 11th, but if you can't wait that long, you can actually download it now.
4163636	4167177	And the way you do this is participate in their alternate reality game.
4167597	4169077	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4197405	4209293	Precinct52.com and then you can just look for the four pieces of evidence which are the short cigarette marked 11117B the origami bird
4214477	4219039	Coffee Shop C, which you'll actually click on the one that says Diner on it.
4219520	4223622	And then the Tire Tracks, it's 117H.
4223722	4225703	When you click on the Tire Tracks, it actually expands it out.
4225943	4226683	Same with the cigarettes.
4226724	4231426	You click on the picture of the cigarette and there'll be two different choices and choose 117B.
4231786	4238530	Once you've done all that, you'll receive a code to download the demo immediately, which is better than waiting until the 11th.
4241068	4241928	Other fun stuff.
4242009	4255141	Coming to the PlayStation Network, Fret Nice, which was a game... It's kind of a side-scroll platformer game that was actually a Flash game at one time that you played entirely with the Guitar Hero Rock Band controller.
4255721	4258284	Although, for whatever reason, they decided to go with this really...
4259545	4259745	and so on.
4275012	4277353	So, PlayStation 3 this week, though.
4278373	4291717	And then finally, Rock Band is getting some new download content, including... Well, tonight, actually, was the Who Super Bowl smash-up medley.
4292477	4297178	And that was available for $2, or $2 in whatever respective points you're spending.
4300839	4327365	Also this week will be another album as well, including Holy Wars, The Punishment Due, which is for also $2, Hanger 18, Take No Prisoners, Five Magics, Poison Was The Cure, Lucretia, Tornado Of Souls, Dawn Patrol, and Rest In Peace Polaris.
4327945	4330686	All those are available for $2 as well.
4332767	4336609	And that's, of course, off the Megadeth Hangar 18, I believe.
4336889	4338930	Or, no, Rust in Peace, if I'm not mistaken.
4340131	4343252	Okay, well, I've got some more news for you guys for some other types of games.
4343592	4346834	Not music-based, but definitely a popular game folks are looking forward to.
4346934	4348114	Mod Nation Racers.
4348655	4350415	As you know, this game is coming out on the PlayStation 3.
4351116	4352636	Do we have a time frame when that game's coming out?
4352676	4353177	Is that summer?
4353397	4355958	It got delayed again, so June as of right now.
4356178	4361299	Well, apparently, not only is there going to be a PlayStation 3 version, there's going to be a PSP version launching.
4361339	4362059	What?
4362419	4364120	I know, I've never heard this news before.
4364140	4365000	Totally new news.
4365540	4372161	But anyway, just so you know, this game does have all the same tools that you'll find in the PS3 version, but of course the graphics are going to be scaled down a little bit.
4372441	4380423	But you still do get to make your own cars, your own racers, your own tracks, and you get to share them with the PSP Mod Nation community.
4380983	4383884	You get to go online with it and race and all that fun stuff.
4385224	4412353	PS3 and PSP versions launching side by side very similar to LittleBigPlanet of course also has the PS3 and PSP versions but there was about a year break between the two don't expect to see that same large window between these two releases again totally new news to me I hadn't heard this anywhere before hey Civ Network is a popular anticipated Facebook game at least at my house I'm really excited to play Civilization Network but not going to get a chance to tell June
4412853	4416214	Yeah, that's when the Civilization Network beta is apparently happening, is June.
4416754	4418595	So, yeah.
4418695	4421436	Variety, of all places, is the one that made this report.
4421476	4423937	Yeah, Variety, the magazine usually talks about movies and TV.
4423997	4426378	Well, they have to talk about games, too, when there's big stuff going on.
4426818	4430679	The beta for the new Facebook game, according to Variety, not starting until June.
4431139	4437161	Yeah, by the way, this game was initially announced back in October, and that they were going to do a beta tester hunt soon.
4438202	4440543	So soon means nine months.
4441944	4444877	So, yeah, it's like saying, you know, I'm going to have a baby soon.
4446852	4473744	One other thing I got for you guys this week A game lots and lots of people are talking about Mass Effect 2 is obviously a hugely popular title this week And with good reason from what I understand I haven't played it myself But I hear it's pretty fucking epic One thing though that is not epic is the size of the text And if you're playing on a standard television You probably can't read it It's got the tiny text problem You know, you've heard about this in other games before It's not just Mass Effect 2 that's had this problem I want to say Lost Planet had this Some other games too
4474424	4479307	and usually companies patch this problem so that you can actually read these on an SDTV.
4479627	4480207	Well, guess what?
4481048	4490132	According to the project manager, Michael Gamble, let's see, quote, we understand that on some SDTVs, the smallest text in Mass Effect 2 can be difficult to read.
4490492	4494915	While this was not an intentional result, it was a byproduct of the enhancements to the user interface.
4495375	4501418	After investigating potential solutions, we have determined that while this issue does affect a small portion of SDTV owners,
4501858	4502299	DarkSakura
4512076	4514797	Well, if you don't have a big team, you should just get one anyway, regardless.
4516958	4523881	Well, the PSP Go is apparently getting a relaunch, even though the PSP Go is kind of crap anyway.
4525242	4530924	But Game Revision is saying that they're definitely going to have a relaunch and that there's going to be a price drop.
4531024	4532505	So maybe that'll work.
4532565	4532985	Who knows?
4533685	4534626	I still think it's crap.
4536340	4547932	Also, for our DDR fans, DDR Universe 3, Dance Dance Revolution Universe 3 is on Xbox 360 games on demand.
4548333	4550815	So, get your $30 ready if you want it.
4551716	4555380	Or save your money, because it was my least favorite of the Xbox 360 games.
4556505	4560648	And now, this is the thing that I actually bought a thousand cryptic points for.
4561409	4566392	Is that you can play a Ferengi or a Federation Klingon in Star Trek Online.
4567233	4571136	But, it's like, you have to pay so much.
4571356	4572337	Okay, get this.
4572457	4577480	You pay 240 cryptic points for a Klingon, right?
4577901	4580863	You play 80 for a Ferengi.
4580883	4580863	80. 80.
4583493	4584154	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4601078	4612206	I suppose WoW charges you for certain types of faction changes and so forth, but I can't think of anything that's locked out without having to spend more money, except, I suppose, actual expansion packs themselves.
4612266	4612586	I don't know.
4612606	4618130	Well, the one thing that I want them to do is to make some of the pre-order special stuff available for other people.
4619251	4624515	And also, for some reason, my Liberated Borg isn't showing up.
4624755	4629038	I haven't tried looking in the thing again, but I haven't been able to make a Liberated Borg for my bridge crew.
4630353	4630613	Uh oh.
4630833	4632094	Maybe I need to find out where that is.
4632815	4638058	But I mean, I'm just saying that, you know, and the other thing too is that I bought more points so I could buy a third character slot.
4639199	4640480	Are you only allowed two character slots?
4640500	4641160	Two character slots.
4641220	4643322	Are there multiple servers or is it just one giant server?
4643602	4644362	One big giant server.
4644422	4645203	Oh wow, that's kind of cool.
4645223	4651927	But the big thing is they were having, if you buy a lifetime membership, then you can have, you start off with four slots.
4652708	4655049	And if you have the year one, you get like one more extra slot, I think.
4655149	4655650	So I don't know.
4655850	4659092	I didn't, I don't have the money for a lifetime, although I'd pay for it.
4660170	4664995	Question from our chat room from Amaze Satsuma, chat.orangeloungeradio.com Do the female Ferengi wear clothes?
4665476	4673604	Yes, they do, and there's an explanation for that, because keep in mind, all of our DS9 buddies out there, Ram's the Grand Nagus, and he brought in social reform.
4674886	4675747	Let's go to Twitter topics.
4675827	4676748	Twitter topics.
4678484	4680625	Every week we invite you guys to send us your tweets.
4680766	4686809	Show us your tweets at username OLR and submit your topics for possible consideration to be read on the show.
4687190	4689951	There's a few of them tonight, so I don't think we're going to read all of these, but I'll read a few of these.
4690412	4695355	From PodCulture, Twitter topic, collector's editions of video games.
4695815	4696796	Yay or nay?
4698456	4700658	I say yay depending on what you're into.
4700778	4702479	Some of the extras can be cool sometimes.
4703000	4710046	It gets a little weird though when there's like really game changing items that are only available in the collector's edition.
4710386	4710706	I don't know.
4710766	4712388	That's not cool to me.
4712908	4716031	But I mean if it's a game I really like, sure I'm going to get the collector's edition.
4716051	4719113	Like if there's a Final Fantasy XIII collector's edition, I'm probably buying it.
4720354	4722095	Loki, Collector's Editions, yay, nay.
4722235	4724035	It all depends what's in it and how much it's for.
4724055	4725976	I don't even have to ask Jamie.
4726016	4728037	She's thumbing through her Star Trek Collector's Edition right now.
4728057	4728817	It came with an art book.
4728957	4729417	It was cool.
4729477	4730677	And a pen.
4730818	4732618	And I get all kinds of cool stuff with it.
4735079	4741321	If there's something that I really, really like, and you know me and I love stuff, I will get the Collector's Edition.
4743693	4768213	going through some other tweets here Alex Carson interesting question I don't know if we're going to have much of an answer to this on Twitter what podcast do you guys like to tune into please tell me one of you guys likes Dignation here's the thing and I don't know if Loki and Jamie feel similarly but I don't listen to a lot of other podcasts because I don't want to be inadvertently influenced by what I hear on other shows like I'm all for you guys how John Tesh of you
4768793	4773315	Well, I'm all for you guys listening to independent shows, and I think you should support other independent radio.
4773715	4779217	But I don't want to hear something on one show and then inadvertently, without knowing, copy it.
4779237	4779857	Does that make sense?
4780117	4780357	Yeah.
4780917	4782898	But I do support folks listening to other shows.
4782958	4783598	There are a few.
4783658	4784478	I've listened to more.
4784939	4789480	I drive to the Bay Area more often now because I date somebody that lives in the Bay Area, and it's about a two-hour drive.
4789860	4791801	I have used podcasts to fill the gap.
4792301	4794702	Let me check with DarkSakura and Loki, though, first before I answer.
4794902	4796242	I do have a couple podcasts I like.
4796883	4797923	DarkSakura, Loki, anything?
4798462	4817946	I was listening to the GrammarCast for a while and there are a couple more like a few classic gaming ones that I was you know listening to but for the most part I actually don't really have time you know I should set them up to download on my iPhone but I hardly ever forget to update my iPhone anyway
4818228	4818428	Right.
4818609	4818849	Loki?
4819370	4821253	I don't really listen to their podcasts.
4821633	4824297	You can't at your work either because you're on the phone and stuff, right?
4824377	4825940	So I know a lot of people listen to this at work.
4825960	4826601	Yeah, I'm on the phone.
4826661	4827202	Past the time.
4829485	4833811	No, it's not... I just don't because...
4835327	4836267	I don't know, I just don't.
4837088	4838148	I don't have time.
4838328	4840569	Well, I probably have time during the day, but I just don't want to.
4843470	4845891	Not that I don't think there's good stuff out there.
4846691	4847892	I don't listen to the radio either.
4848512	4858856	I listen to my CD player, or I guess MP3 player right now, that has like 10 songs on it, and I loop them, and I just don't care about adding new stuff to it.
4858876	4860877	So same thing with podcasts, you know.
4862137	4863780	Um, you know, I read the news.
4864801	4872731	There's no, you know, for me, I'd probably listen to the game podcast and, you know, and I read news and stuff, so I don't really need to hear the news again.
4873252	4877277	You know, it's just... Wait a minute, you just told people to basically not listen to this show.
4879620	4881062	Hey, so be it, you know, whatever.
4881823	4883425	I'm just telling you why I don't listen to it.
4883505	4890173	We like to talk about all the news too, not just, I mean, we try to report, like, usually we're not the ones breaking the news, but we talk about it.
4890193	4896481	Yeah, there's absolutely no news breaking here other than, oh my god, you know, Mod Nation Racers on PSP.
4898563	4898923	DarkSakura.com
4916600	4938492	as far as video game podcasts go um i i don't know how far i want to say this like i have tried listening to a corporate oriented podcast um it was a very niche thing uh and i kind of find my found myself a little bit bored listening to it it was kind of a niche gaming podcast i kind of thought the hosts didn't have energy like they they didn't sound excited about what they were talking about it's kind of like
4939107	4940367	Hello and welcome to our show.
4940407	4942408	We're going to talk about this topic today.
4942488	4944528	As hosted by Bob Ross?
4945428	4945988	Kind of.
4946128	4952990	I shouldn't say negative things, but a lot of corp podcasts, like, dude, you're even paid to be there.
4953070	4953790	Well, yeah, exactly.
4953830	4954510	Be excited.
4954530	4955850	That and the corporate podcasts, too.
4955870	4960431	It's just like, hey, look at all these games that the game publishers just dumped on our desk with gold and money.
4960451	4961871	Look at all this shit I get to play for free.
4961891	4964212	They literally shove money into my pockets.
4964292	4966052	And I was just like, oh, I hate that.
4966192	4967053	Thank you for watching!
4986173	4988034	Some of them are such douches.
4988154	4989555	Anyhow, I'm not going to linger on the negative.
4989595	4992637	Let me move to the positive because there are some indie podcasts I've listened to that I like.
4992797	4995159	Obviously, I like Bobby's show, but clearly I'm biased.
4995339	4997240	And Friday Night Gaming, I think, is a great show too.
4998160	4999961	I actually listen to, and I really like the show.
4999981	5002383	I've listened to it like three times now on my drives to San Francisco.
5002483	5003844	I like the Warcraft Outsiders.
5004344	5009128	It's the spinoff of Video Game Outsiders, which is a show kind of similar to us.
5009288	5015693	It's a girl and two guys who kind of drink and talk about the video game news, except they all do it on Skype.
5015713	5018315	I think one of them is in Canada, and I think the others are on the East Coast somewhere.
5018335	5021157	But they do a spinoff show about Warcraft, and I think it's pretty good.
5021217	5024099	The girl leads it, and she's like a hardcore raider healer.
5024119	5028303	I think her and her boyfriend play a lot, and I think they're pretty well informed of what they're talking about.
5028383	5028803	It has energy.
5032426	5034368	They enjoy what they're talking about.
5034428	5039252	Although one guy on the show, kind of the running gag is that he doesn't really play Warcraft, so why is he there?
5039352	5042214	But they make it funny, so it works.
5042775	5044216	But they have energy.
5044256	5048219	When she talks about her rating and stuff, you can tell she is having fun.
5048259	5050321	And she's doing a show about something she really likes.
5050401	5052783	And the guy, too, and the guest host.
5053324	5056526	For those that want my opinion on what makes a good podcast...
5057367	5059248	Have fun on what you're talking about.
5059448	5062650	Make people want to listen to you because you are excited.
5062690	5065471	I try to have energy on this show every week, even if I'm having a shit week.
5065692	5070874	And don't forget, we've also got the comic podcast too that Mar and Marvel and I do.
5071955	5072555	And we giggle!
5073156	5073816	And are excited!
5075393	5075873	So there you go.
5078035	5079236	Anyhow, let's see.
5079276	5082958	Let me move on to other comments on our Twitter.
5083739	5091024	Spazinator says, latest rumor, Patrick Stewart is said to be a huge fan of handheld gaming, specifically on the N-Gage.
5092385	5092645	Get it?
5093579	5095200	Oh my god, did I really just read that joke?
5095240	5101684	See, let it not be said that we do not let every gamer have a voice, even when we should probably throw tomatoes at them.
5101744	5102684	Waka waka waka!
5102704	5107587	You know, the bad joke of the week wouldn't be a good, or wouldn't be a bad idea, you know, that would be kind of funny.
5109144	5111505	You get the OLR tomato award of the night, Spazinator.
5111525	5112805	Congratulations.
5112865	5114266	Here's one more Twitter question for you guys.
5114326	5118006	Blue Swim asks us, any word on President Cat coming here?
5118367	5118587	Nope.
5118867	5119147	P.S.
5119187	5122188	DarkSakura, I can have Mischief Makers as classic game of the week?
5123348	5123688	Maybe.
5124728	5129650	As far as President Cat goes, we didn't hear anything after the whole little gauntlet of stuff that happened that week.
5132111	5134753	I don't think it's happening.
5134973	5140339	There was the negative stories about that it only sold 100 copies, which I still say were bullshit.
5141019	5143922	I fail to see how that was possible.
5143982	5145944	Maybe 100 copies were imported to the US.
5145964	5147445	There is no way it sold 100 copies.
5147465	5147706	I'm sorry.
5149267	5155696	I mean, even the crappiest of absolute shit that comes out on the Wii sells a lot of copies.
5155976	5158640	That's why they release stuff on the Wii.
5158820	5162425	It's because people are like, hey, it's a game, it's cheap, let me buy it.
5162945	5163706	You know, it could be...
5166030	5169211	I don't know, it could be a game about working at a call center or something.
5169231	5174391	Now, the Twitter account Renowe has still been kind of making posts as of late, so they're still kind of, you know, there.
5175412	5176972	But I don't know.
5177272	5180593	I think at this point I'm not holding my breath to see it released over here.
5180653	5181453	But, you know, don't give up.
5181513	5183993	Continue to follow it and send them tweets.
5184193	5193295	And I think the best case scenario at this point is that someone kind of caught wind of this whole thing going on and maybe we'll see a game like President Cat.
5194275	5200857	But remember, there's a certain charm that President Cat had, and when you make a copy of a copy, the quality declines.
5201017	5208100	So just be very thoughtful in how you do that if you are said publisher listening right now thinking about cashing in on the President Cat craze.
5208820	5210821	I think, again, it would sell.
5211201	5211481	It would.
5212844	5216127	Let's get back into some long-form gaming news.
5216307	5218609	We'll read more of your tweets next week at twitter.com.
5219350	5220411	The mailbag's coming up, though.
5220431	5223994	I know DarkSakura's going to tear into that in just a moment, but we do have some news before we get there, Loki.
5224194	5224354	Yes.
5225475	5231320	You may remember that there was a—well, there's been a few knockoff Wii systems out there.
5231621	5236085	One of them was Zone 40, which was just some, like—
5237515	5244362	It looks sort of like a Wii, but not quite, you know, and it had, you know, 40 little mini-games.
5244422	5260497	Well now, they have the officially licensed Sega Zone, which has 20 Genesis Classic games and 30 new games, 16 of which are playable with the devices, two wireless motion controllers, and, um...
5262239	5266660	Yeah, and it's in wonderful black and blue with the Sega logo on the side.
5267941	5270182	Trying to see what games are in there.
5270802	5272142	It's kind of hard to see.
5272242	5273042	Oh, wait, here we go.
5273223	5274543	Let me guess, Sonic the Hedgehog?
5274723	5276083	Well, Sonic the Hedgehog, yes.
5276143	5277624	I mean, that's, you know...
5278164	5279005	Um, obvious.
5279545	5287091	Uh, looks like Alex Kidd, Sonic & Knuckles, uh, Columns 3, E-SWAT, Echo the Dolphin, Golden Axe.
5287131	5289873	The same shit that's in every Sega compilation, basically.
5290033	5294817	Then, like, some of the other, uh, like, arcade games that they have, uh...
5296693	5299014	I think a lot of this is just some generic stuff.
5299054	5300835	Like they have what looks like a boxing game.
5300855	5302456	Looks like Wii Boxing or something.
5302656	5304137	I can actually see the little picture here.
5304177	5305297	I got a blown up version of it.
5305618	5308639	E-SWAT, Sonic Spinball, Golden Axe, Shinobi.
5309019	5312861	And then in the Sega games section, they have Cannon.
5313181	5317163	Well, no, that's the 14 arcade games section right below that.
5317203	5318864	Mr. Balls is one of them.
5318884	5319625	Oh, I see, I see.
5320425	5322106	Bomber, Cannon...
5323539	5324220	Yeah, I see that.
5324240	5326224	Some bottle caps race or something.
5327005	5334297	It's like they basically just copied over some of the crappy games that were on there and put some Sega Genesis games on there.
5336008	5337609	And then some interactive sports games.
5337629	5337869	Look at that.
5337889	5341050	It's like Wii Sports, but with 16 different games, including darts, I see.
5342371	5342771	Interesting.
5343291	5343971	Is that curling?
5344531	5345092	I believe it is.
5346092	5347933	It would all depend on what the price is.
5348033	5355276	And it says, I guess it's priced at 39.95 euros, I believe.
5358457	5359037	I don't know, though.
5359077	5362959	I mean, it's cute, but I think I'll pass on that.
5364153	5371241	Anyhow, I don't know how I feel about these games, but Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy, you know these games.
5371261	5380911	They're actually, I believe they're like Sony Pictures Entertainment game shows, but THQ has actually licensed the franchises to make video games based on them.
5381011	5385736	I mean, it's not like it would be the first time ever a video game has been made out of Wheel of Fortune or Jeopardy.
5385936	5391218	But it would be awesome if they were, I don't know, one of the Xbox, you know.
5391298	5392858	That's what I'm saying.
5392918	5402921	That's where I was going to go with this is that wouldn't that be cool if they actually, I mean, to make these games more fun, did the whole like 1 versus 100 route and made them like a little more interactive like that?
5403021	5406982	Seriously, 1 versus 100 is awesome and everything, but it's starting to get old.
5407923	5411944	And, you know, I thought there was supposed to be more than just one game on there.
5413104	5418107	And honestly, I've never played 1 vs. 100 on Xbox Live.
5418668	5419228	It's fun-ish.
5420048	5420689	Dan likes it.
5420869	5424171	I was number one one night on Video Game Trivia halfway through.
5424211	5424951	I finally missed.
5424991	5426792	I think I had a 26-question streak.
5427153	5429734	And at one of the breaks, I was number one on the leaderboard.
5429774	5431175	I took a picture and posted it on Twitter and everything.
5431375	5432776	I talked about it a few weeks ago on the show.
5433857	5435678	But sadly, yeah, I finally failed.
5435718	5439540	I think the question I failed on was... Oh, I remember it was the ESRB rating.
5439620	5441241	What was the ESRB rating for Worms 2?
5441881	5442362	I got it wrong.
5443042	5469746	but anyway it's fun playing the Xbox Live one can be fun but yeah I get what you're saying though it does get old a lot of these game show things get old but if there was that variety I think it could be pretty cool especially like Jeopardy, Wheel of Fortune I think these could be cool games to do live you know with the whole like I don't think everybody would just watch three players but maybe if everybody got you know how like 1 vs 100 splits you up into parties of four
5470006	5470286	Yeah.
5470546	5485436	Maybe if these games did that, split you up into random parties of three, and you played a predetermined puzzle or predetermined set of questions, and then you can see maybe at the end who out of all the matches was like the top, who got the big, big score.
5485817	5486977	I mean, there's ways you could do it.
5487017	5487918	I think it'd make it fun.
5488538	5488638	Yeah.
5488659	5490820	But sadly, I don't think THQ is going to be doing that.
5490900	5491520	Because guess what?
5491560	5495623	They're actually going to be releasing them specifically on the Wii and the DS.
5496644	5496864	Yes.
5496904	5499326	So, in other words, get ready to spin the wheel with your Wiimote.
5500026	5505951	And they're going to be as bad as successful as The Price is Right and the other games that came out, which were not very much.
5505971	5508133	Yeah, I heard Press Your Luck and Price is Right weren't that bad.
5509193	5512316	But anyway, later this year is when those first games are coming out.
5512636	5519081	The statement, by the way, about these games came from the THQ Kids, Family, and Casual Games executive VP.
5519222	5522084	So no hardcore Wheel of Fortune for you.
5523895	5524736	I am sorry to say.
5525336	5528579	I really wish they would go the live game show route though on Xbox Live.
5528619	5529860	I hope we do get some more of those.
5530660	5531341	I really do.
5531621	5533663	Wouldn't it be cool to actually have a live Press Your Luck?
5534443	5535404	I would love that!
5535524	5536805	Or a live... Old school.
5536885	5538266	A live Price is Right.
5538326	5541569	I mean, imagine you could be in the audience with your little avatar.
5541629	5542830	Higher, higher, lower.
5542850	5543951	Have your little Plinko party.
5543971	5544491	Plinko party.
5545890	5573693	there's so much more that can be done and I hope it is done well how about something that's good news for a lot of people there's Fallout New Vegas will be out summer 2010 there's actually a trailer up and everything it's being developed by Obsidian Entertainment the same people that gave us Knights of the Old Republic 2 Neverwinter Knights 2 and this is going to be a direct follow up to Fallout 3
5575396	5576117	It looked kind of neat.
5577678	5578858	I just know a lot of people like Fallout.
5579679	5581860	Oh yeah, Fallout's a hugely popular game, especially number three.
5582301	5583601	It's one of those games I have yet to play.
5583641	5585903	It's in my little rental queue, but I haven't gotten the game yet.
5587684	5589065	But I hear it's Oblivion with guns.
5589365	5590466	But so much came out.
5590686	5593108	We don't have time to play every single video game.
5593508	5596450	But I'll try to get around to it, at least before Final Fantasy XIII comes out.
5596470	5598051	Because when that comes out, yeah.
5598431	5599912	Yeah, I'm worried about that.
5600012	5601913	I'm not really going to be playing anything else for a while.
5603334	5604135	I know myself.
5606148	5606849	So sad.
5607609	5609370	All these games.
5610291	5611632	So this is kind of interesting.
5612912	5621538	You may remember back we talked a little bit about how Walmart and Best Buy were kind of getting into this kiosk trade-in type of business.
5622578	5629563	They were going to be able to buy, sell, trade games, also rent out games, and I believe DVDs as well.
5630583	5637725	Problem is, though, the company behind it, Eplay, has ceased operations.
5638406	5647969	So I don't know if that means closing or out of business or whatever, but they're no longer operating, if you will.
5648989	5652110	So unfortunately, that will probably go away.
5653130	5655531	which is too bad because I hear that their trading values are pretty good.
5657492	5667035	Not true though if you're doing that in Canada because I believe actually in Canada Best Buy actually handles their trade-ins in the store and not through a kiosk so that's kind of cool.
5668435	5680666	Also, GameCrazy, apparently the parent company, Movie Gallery, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy again.
5681406	5688672	And they're only basically going to drop it down to only 250 GameCrazy locations once they're done.
5689313	5692776	And be liquidating close to 760 stores.
5694477	5695338	I can vouch for that.
5696237	5698640	That's a lot of depressing news in the retail world.
5698901	5699201	Yeah.
5699522	5700944	No, that's something that hits home here.
5701324	5702025	Oh, sure, I'm sure.
5702165	5704028	Do you know yet if everything's going to be okay?
5704428	5707212	We're thinking that the Cameron Park store is going to be okay.
5707473	5707853	That's cool.
5708774	5709015	All right.
5709035	5709455	Well, good luck.
5709495	5710497	I hope everything turns out all right.
5710717	5711078	Me too.
5711098	5712419	You know, I like living in a house.
5714056	5715237	Anyhow, on to happier news.
5715638	5720985	Some of the comments in chat still talking about the whole ideas of game shows on Xbox Live.
5721386	5726513	And I think SSJ100Matt totally has the winner idea of what game should be on Xbox Live.
5726793	5727154	You ready?
5735306	5735686	Ah, yes.
5735947	5736987	Ah, yes, the match game.
5738268	5741911	If only they could find a way to bring back Brett Summers and Charles Nelson Reilly from the dead.
5741931	5744092	It would be amazing.
5744472	5745673	Kind of a sad face news.
5745693	5747234	You know I'm big on LiveJournal, right?
5747314	5757661	One of my good friends that I've had on LiveJournal for years now ran a community on LiveJournal called Match Game LJ, which, you know, kind of did like a little LiveJournal version of the match game every week.
5757681	5761344	He decided to close it down this week, and he's not going to be running it anymore.
5761404	5762204	Give me sad face.
5763205	5764926	So what up, Mark, if you're listening, although I doubt he is.
5766046	5767587	But yes, Match Game should be on Xbox Live.
5767727	5768407	That would be wonderful.
5769807	5770267	I would love that.
5771048	5772348	Alright, on to some other news.
5772768	5776369	This is definitely kind of an eyebrow-raising piece here from Harmonix.
5776829	5786932	Harmonix has apparently done some more licensing, and this really isn't a big surprise when you consider, oh yeah, duh, Harmonix makes music games, and you know, they license stuff for Rock Band 2 all of the time.
5787292	5790833	But look at some of the things they've been licensing lately.
5790873	5792674	This is all from the Royalty Network.
5792714	5794014	I guess some people were watching there.
5794574	5805084	Anteup by M.O.P., Say Ah by Trey Songs, Evacuate the Dance Floor by Cascada, The Way I Are by Timbaland featuring D.O.E.
5805665	5808647	Those are all like dancey poppy songs.
5808707	5810449	They don't belong in rock band.
5811210	5811890	Or do they?
5812411	5815314	Or what is going on at Camp Harmonix?
5815994	5816355	Hmm.
5817182	5818582	DJ Heroish Game in the Works DDR
5837188	5837909	Thanks for watching!
5856784	5859347	I don't know, I've got to admit, you know what I'm tempted to say?
5860167	5862609	My gut tells me it's a dance game.
5863110	5868295	That they're going to try to take the dance game crown from Konami and now's a pretty good time.
5869035	5869576	Honestly.
5870617	5871257	They could do it.
5873399	5874320	I don't know, what do you guys think?
5876202	5876342	Um...
5878149	5880251	Obviously, this is a topic that hits home here at OLR.
5880391	5881692	This show started over DDR.
5881712	5884734	The dance genre is really that popular anymore.
5884774	5891879	I mean, I guess you've seen a couple titles that are really kind of stand out now, but they're a little bit different than DDR.
5892200	5896423	Just Dance is a title that I'm surprised is doing okay.
5896683	5902708	Actually, I have some co-workers, and I always talk about co-workers because that's my way to gauge the casual gamer.
5903568	5932394	some of my co-workers that I would not imagine played a lot of Nintendo Wii love Just Dance and think it's like great and I've heard some people on the show talking highly about it too some of our chatters and stuff apparently it's this big cult music game that's doing very well culty type I gotta play it at some point but anyway sorry what was the rest of your thought there no I'm just surprised that you know that's doing well so I'm not sure if they would be going like that route though
5934598	5938139	Frisbee in our chatroom says, Konami doesn't have the crown, Stepmania does.
5938919	5944501	I'm just going to say this and rip it off like a band-aid here and just kind of give you my thought here.
5944781	5946161	Stepmania is not legitimate.
5947042	5951783	I know that probably sucks to hear, and I know it's got a big community and everything, but it's not legitimate.
5952475	5978854	neither is in the groove do you well in the groove is a step above step mania in the groove was the way to try and legitimize step mania but let me put it this way you do not walk into a GameStop and buy step mania over the counter or do you really buy step mania at all I mean it's just not it's not the same step mania was always there to emulate DDR and then yeah they tried to kind of innovate it later especially within the groove and so forth but it's not I mean I could see Harmonix doing what Konami should have done
5979454	5986440	about six years ago and reinventing DDR from the ground up, which supposedly is also happening by Konami right now.
5986860	5990563	I haven't heard what's up with that DDR game they're supposed to be putting out with eight panels.
5990944	5992265	Wasn't that supposed to be out last Christmas?
5992285	5993105	It got delayed.
5994346	6001172	Yeah, it was supposed to be actually out this spring, and it still hasn't been released yet.
6001332	6004315	I think probably the second quarter.
6004975	6007996	But even still, it's just, I can't get excited about it.
6008436	6014357	Watch, I go to DDRFreak.com and let's see, do I see anything about the new DDR game?
6014997	6025660	Let's see, DDR Freak, Pump It Up Pro 2, Step Mania the Manga, DJ Hero Deal, Cobalt Flux, back in November, $40 Amazon credit with various hero bundles, yeah.
6026480	6028681	There's no news on DDR and even DDR Freak.
6028801	6033603	I mean, that is a sign about how Konami has fumbled and dropped the DDR crown.
6033683	6039585	I think if Harmonix were to show up at E3 with a new dance game with... I hate to say it, guys.
6039625	6054751	I know I'm going to piss some of you off with this comment, but without the J-pop and the stuff that most people on this side of the ocean don't know, but stuff like Timberland and Cascada and people actually recognize from clubs, Harmonix is going to... They're going to do to DDR what they did to Guitar Hero.
6056051	6058392	or Guitar Freaks, sorry, with Guitar Hero.
6059172	6060113	That could be what we're looking at.
6060593	6061673	Well, we'll just have to wait and see.
6062173	6065695	And it could be that Rock Band 3, I mean, again, this is all speculation.
6065855	6070537	I don't know why my gut just tells me Konami's vulnerable right now.
6070877	6077259	If DDR Freak can't even tell you the latest on what's going on with 8-panel DDR and this whole reinvention of the franchise, I mean, hello.
6077980	6078860	Something is wrong.
6080681	6080941	Right?
6081421	6081581	Yeah.
6081601	6081681	Yeah.
6082208	6084350	You know, we technically do have 8-panel DDR, Rob.
6085331	6085671	Doubles.
6086472	6087353	You know what I'm talking about.
6087433	6088254	I know, I know.
6088314	6090075	Well, just like quad mode.
6090415	6091476	Did that ever catch on?
6091717	6092077	No.
6092918	6095760	DarkTetsuya is saying, So, Rob, are you saying DDR is dead?
6097742	6098623	Well... Yes.
6098643	6098743	Yes.
6099600	6101302	It kind of died about five years ago.
6102563	6106126	Around the time this show stopped talking about DDR was kind of when it was starting to die.
6106286	6112272	I hate to say it, but I don't think it'll ever die, but it's not what it was ten years ago.
6113313	6113893	Let's face it.
6114814	6115375	Reality check.
6117442	6123446	Anyhow, hey, let's get into some more pleasant topics and talk a little bit about what is going on in our email bag.
6123846	6136915	That's right, every week we invite you guys to send us emails to our email address at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and every week DarkSakura likes to tear the mail bag open and read some of her favorite emails for us to respond to here on the show.
6138246	6142289	So DarkSakura, dive into the mailbag and tell us what emails are we getting this week?
6142529	6143610	Well, we got one recent.
6143710	6146573	It was one of the ones that were deleted when I was getting rid of the spam.
6148054	6149155	So I'll go ahead and read it first.
6149675	6151376	Hi, OLR crew, AZHP here.
6151416	6158162	I was listening to your podcast from the 10th and heard Jamie brush off the Rockstar forced overtime deal because they would get time and a half.
6158642	6165868	I work in the programming industry as well and I can tell you with 100% certainty that pretty much no one in the entire industry in California gets paid a cent of overtime.
6166548	6177916	Furthermore, and this is generally the norm for the games industry in general, employees are forced to work 12 hours, 6-7 days a week, with no overtime pay, no compensation for PTO, no bonuses, and sometimes even no vacation.
6177956	6180557	By the way, PTO is paid time off for those who don't speak office speak.
6181678	6183760	Sometimes even no vacation after a project is finished.
6184520	6187822	There are also generally threats of dismissal if one does not go into work.
6188243	6196328	These people are so fatigued getting one or zero days off that week, they make more and more mistakes, and they have to stay even longer to fix them.
6196748	6202334	There is a law in California that says you can be exempt from getting paid overtime if you make more than $90,000 in a year.
6202974	6205337	However, game developers generally make about half that.
6206017	6211162	It might seem like a decent salary, but when you're working 100 hour work weeks, it equates to about $14 an hour.
6215246	6217348	Now you might say, take it up with the law or quit.
6217468	6220571	However, these people are so overworked that they don't have the time to file a lawsuit.
6221031	6230940	And getting into the industry is so hard because there are so few studios owned by even fewer publishers that it's 100 times harder to get a job in the games industry than it is any other job, especially in our economic climate.
6231540	6235685	I'm sorry for the lengthy rant, but I was appalled at the complacency of the crew on reporting on this story.
6235985	6242492	I wanted everyone to know the true nature of the beast so that they could understand what most game developers go through to bring you the games you love to play.
6242692	6244194	Yours truly, AZHPPS.
6244214	6246016	Sorry about the terrible Silent Hill joke last time.
6246456	6246977	I just had to.
6247677	6252362	My point is that it's because no one says anything that this shit continues.
6253644	6276504	I kind of I sort of agree like I don't I don't want to say I'm complacent with this I mean it does strike me as very wrong but at the same time I feel like I don't know enough about that perspective because most of the people I know that work for developers aren't making these same complaints and I don't know if it's because of and it's addressing that email the fear of if they speak up they're going to get fired but if everything that's in that email is true that's bullshit
6277265	6287590	of course it's bullshit and maybe the wives should be speaking up and somebody has got to stand up for these people and put a stop to this by the way though you don't have to make $90,000 a year to be exempt from overtime trust me I know
6288058	6294581	Yeah, no, if you are an exempt employee, then your overtime is counted in other ways.
6295262	6297223	There are still boundaries.
6298663	6304646	I don't like to talk a lot about my day job because I don't want to ever jeopardize that here on the show, but I will say these few key things.
6304747	6313271	I am an exempt employee where I work, but anytime I do have to work those extra hours, my company is very good about balancing it out.
6313551	6315352	You get basically comped time, right?
6315872	6316473	In a way.
6316513	6322460	I don't think I should reveal those types of things on the show, but there are ways they make up for it, and I don't feel overworked.
6322820	6324422	And everybody should have that privilege.
6324442	6328867	I've had times at my job where they say, oh, we've got mandatory overtime this weekend, and I'm like, I'm not coming.
6329928	6330369	Why not?
6331751	6332351	I'm not coming.
6332511	6333412	I have other things to do.
6333913	6334534	I made plans.
6334874	6335655	Sorry, I'm not coming.
6336856	6338137	And they'll be like, well, okay.
6338217	6341659	Because they cannot make you work mandatory overtime.
6342460	6346082	They just say mandatory because they're strongly suggesting it.
6346102	6347583	Because they need to have the people there.
6347903	6350605	And maybe it's mandatory for them to request the overtime.
6351365	6353267	But it's not mandatory that you take it.
6353807	6356929	That you, you know, go in and work on your day off.
6357429	6358450	We have a law for a reason.
6359450	6362873	And if, I'm sorry, I really don't feel very sorry for these people who...
6365206	6367007	Well, okay.
6367108	6368268	Actually, no, I don't feel sorry.
6368429	6371291	Because, yeah, it sucks that they're having such a hard time.
6371611	6376835	But as long as they're not doing anything to change it, you know, then they're just adding to the problem.
6377355	6378076	They're adding to the problem.
6378096	6379457	Well, maybe that's why the wives are speaking up.
6379517	6386522	Maybe people, I mean, I can see what he's saying in the email there about there is a very real fear that if I speak up, I'm going to be fired.
6386702	6387463	I could see that.
6387843	6388563	But that's illegal.
6388663	6390545	It's a tough industry to crack into.
6390565	6390645	Yeah.
6390805	6393668	But it still doesn't change the fact of what the law is.
6393948	6397671	I don't want to get too political here, but is it... Just throwing ideas out there.
6398092	6404778	Is it possible that there could be a union of developers and people that work in the game industry?
6404798	6406019	I mean, maybe that's what's needed.
6406600	6407280	I would say so.
6407380	6413926	I mean, if it seems like... Do we need Sally Field to jump up on a table with her sign about starting a union?
6414867	6415628	Well, I...
6418408	6426711	I think that if anyone is working in that kind of condition, it doesn't matter how exhausted they are.
6427551	6439516	If someone does not think enough of themselves, their family, and doing work that they enjoy to try to make their workplace a better place to be, then they don't need to be there.
6440579	6447471	One of our listeners in chat, I'll withhold their name here because they are saying something somewhat negative, says, it's hard to say no, DarkSakura.
6447691	6451458	Once it's okay, twice you don't get a raise and all the industry is connected.
6454593	6456014	He's speaking to that same fear.
6456194	6458336	I mean, I get what you're saying, but I get what he's saying.
6458656	6461158	There's got something has to give.
6461218	6461678	You know what I mean?
6461738	6463079	Well, that goes back to the same thing.
6463239	6465781	If you are unhappy with the environment, you change it.
6466702	6478631	You know, one person may be one person, but for every one person that has a particular distaste for something, there are going to be at least eight other people around them, very close to them that have that same feeling.
6479986	6495363	and sometimes all it takes is for one person to say something before everybody else decides hey yeah we agree well this issue is long from over I'm sure about that maybe it's going to end up being the wives that take this on I don't know it's going to be very interesting to see what develops but for now we should probably move on to another email
6498780	6500420	One comes from Lucky Nuts.
6501761	6503361	Hey, Jamie keeps talking about her vault.
6503461	6512124	I, too, have a vault that I've kept for the last 20 years or so, and I'm considering spending the next few months clearing it out on eBay to buy more grown-up things, like a new sailboat.
6512885	6515866	Have you ever thought about clearing out your collection, and if so, did you later regret it?
6516626	6518627	First of all, grown-up is a concept.
6520247	6524709	You know, you're getting rid of one thing for recreation to get another thing for recreation.
6526298	6528780	Grown up is bullshit.
6529041	6531122	So drop that little attitude right there.
6531303	6532584	I hate that attitude so much.
6533565	6535767	And no, I'm not getting rid of the collection ever.
6536807	6537628	I love our collection.
6537668	6538649	I go back and use all the stuff.
6538729	6540491	I'm happy just looking at it.
6541716	6544837	I like going in the vault and just looking around and going, damn, we got some cool shit.
6544857	6545897	Look at all this shit.
6546117	6546517	I know.
6546597	6548018	That's how I feel.
6548058	6549398	And then she'll invite other people over.
6549618	6551699	Rob, Rob, come over and look at all my shit.
6552979	6554239	Come over here and help me play with this.
6555960	6562561	And by the way, if you go to our YouTube channel, you can actually see some video taken in the vault if you want to see what I have.
6563161	6565142	And if you are going to sell some of your stuff, though, talk to me.
6567330	6567610	Nice.
6567811	6568711	Maybe I'll have something I want.
6568731	6569132	I don't know.
6570233	6574417	I just would say from a non-collector perspective, I've sold some of my stuff.
6574817	6580123	I've never really regretted it though because I try to really think about it and not sell anything that I think I might remotely play again.
6580443	6582505	Like I think I sold my copy of Dead or Alive 4.
6582725	6584186	I just knew I wasn't going to play that again.
6584707	6587009	Misty said she was happy looking at it while she was visiting.
6588230	6588631	There you go.
6590891	6598033	Now, I did get two emails from one other person, but I'm only going to read one of them because really the first one was all like, I like Silent Hill Shattered Memories.
6598433	6605835	Can I say, though, real quick, though, if you did sell your collection and buy the sailboat, you know that you could say, I'm on a boat.
6607655	6609476	You know, that's one of my ringtones on my phone.
6609576	6609776	Is it?
6610076	6610676	I'm not surprised.
6611136	6612876	It's the one when work calls.
6612896	6614057	That's why you buy the sailboat.
6614097	6615097	You want to say, I'm on a boat.
6615977	6616977	I don't want to be on a boat.
6617178	6618078	I want to play my games.
6619722	6620142	DarkSakura.com
6648675	6650296	because then you don't have to do all the crap to it.
6651976	6652776	God, I'm smart.
6652916	6656177	I should just be a financial advisor even though I kind of suck at it.
6656577	6658138	Don't buy a goddamn boat, idiot.
6659218	6660639	You don't need a boat.
6660839	6661619	Fuck boats.
6662339	6662799	Rent it.
6664480	6665260	Charter a boat.
6665380	6667301	Jamie, you need a financial advice podcast.
6667961	6668541	Fuck no.
6669261	6672322	It would be nothing but Dan yelling at me for spending too much money on comics.
6674963	6675463	Fuck rent.
6675503	6676143	Buy comics.
6679096	6686022	DarkSakura, my grammar has greatly improved, except you're not using any capital letters and you misspelled grammar.
6701869	6705732	I was wondering if you guys have ever played the MMO Mabinogi.
6706092	6710155	If so, why have you guys never mentioned it because we haven't?
6710636	6711376	Never heard of it, ever.
6711396	6712057	Why not try it?
6712097	6718101	I mean, it's a lot like World of Warcraft except for Mabinogi is PS3.
6719142	6724966	Is the PS3 of the two you pay for nothing except pet and extra characters unless you are smart enough?
6727268	6727588	Whatever.
6727648	6728429	Is this spam?
6728649	6730851	No, it's... Alright, just checking.
6732331	6733755	I really can't read this.
6733915	6736924	Do you know how easy it would be to... Okay, I'll come stand behind you.
6738710	6745256	Also on another note, the gift Rob got from Loki, where would I find when you can play an NES game on it?
6745556	6746918	It's an FC Mobile, look it up online.
6748419	6758308	Also, I make AMVs from video games and I was wondering, can you guys have any ideas for an AMV?
6758468	6762331	Yes, there should be an AMV where the main character is learning proper spelling and grammar.
6763152	6763913	It would be fascinating.
6764233	6765954	Also, update the podcast more often.
6765974	6766234	Probably not.
6766274	6766754	Whatever.
6766834	6767815	Okay, dude, I'm sorry.
6768936	6772297	Also, spammers need to be raped with a flea warhead.
6772477	6773538	Now that I can get behind.
6775339	6775999	No pun intended.
6776159	6776740	I'm sorry.
6776880	6780942	I can't read your email because it doesn't make sense in my brain.
6782423	6782963	I'm sorry.
6783083	6787325	I'll look at your YouTube videos, but your email hurts my head.
6788786	6789106	All right.
6789406	6789927	I'm sorry.
6790687	6791247	I tried.
6791467	6792388	Are there any other emails?
6793280	6793541	No.
6793701	6796168	Well, there was another one written by the same person, but again... Yes, read it.
6796208	6796870	Please, please, please.
6797111	6798033	I love Silent Hill.
6799216	6800018	Okay, fine.
6800099	6800419	Shit.
6802256	6805497	Okay, first off, this was the first Silent Hill game I've played, so be nice, DarkSakura.
6806118	6806658	Do I have to?
6808039	6809419	Too late.
6809679	6812060	You play as Harry Masons, whose daughter is missing, blah blah blah.
6812420	6812921	We know all that.
6814721	6815722	The gameplay is seamless.
6816422	6821504	Of the PSP, your trusty flashlight adds an extra compen...
6825166	6827489	Commentary pending what you're looking at?
6827870	6829793	Yeah.
6829873	6830654	Sorry, I can't.
6831375	6832717	Also, though, but I do like this.
6832737	6834760	The Nightmare Sequences are a pain in the ass without weapons.
6836782	6837864	Go back and play the first Silent Hill.
6838750	6839291	Can I try?
6839611	6840572	Can I try reading the review?
6840752	6842194	Would you mind if I give it a shot?
6842334	6843015	Give it a try, Rob.
6843035	6843896	Hold on one minute.
6844216	6847179	I gotta bring it up here in studio here, and I will read the review for you guys.
6847460	6848941	Okay, because it's really bad.
6849262	6849702	Alright, hold on.
6849742	6850363	I'm getting in there.
6850723	6850984	Let's see.
6851104	6852465	It's Silent Hill Shattered Memories?
6853006	6853726	That would be the one.
6854027	6855168	Will this review involve...
6858487	6862792	Okay, first off, this is the first Silent Hill game I've played, so be nice, DarkSakura.
6863273	6865496	First off, this is a remake of the original.
6865576	6871143	You play as Harry Mason, whose daughter is missing, and you travel through the mysterious small town of Silent while searching for her.
6871721	6873542	Gameplay is seamless of the PSP.
6873862	6877383	Your trusty flashlight adds an extra commentary pending what you are looking at.
6877743	6881704	You have a cell phone to take pictures of static memoirs and whatnot.
6882124	6890326	The most annoying part of the game is the physiest Trist who pops up and pisses you off and the nightmare sequences are a pain in the ass without weapons.
6890927	6899089	The story changes depending on how you talk with the physierest you could get ending where she's not found or one where blah blah blah spoilers.
6899489	6902030	The game is more fuck with your head than super scary.
6902331	6904452	I give it a 4.5 out of 5.
6906272	6909994	I thought for sure you were going to use one of the audio effects on our new mixing board.
6911055	6912235	But I was wrong.
6912275	6912836	You went back.
6913136	6913776	Echo voice, Rob.
6913816	6914276	Echo voice.
6914396	6915237	You want echo voice?
6915357	6915857	Echo voice.
6920560	6923701	I own your soul.
6924642	6925582	I give it a 4.5 out of 5.
6929178	6930218	Okay, that's enough of that, for real.
6930238	6932619	Sounds like you're at the back end of a tunnel, Rob.
6932699	6932919	All right.
6933820	6934800	New mixing boards are fun.
6935801	6936541	That's it for the mailbag?
6937521	6937761	Yep.
6938282	6938522	All right.
6939782	6944564	Let's move on then to the FUs of the week because sometimes we get angsty here on this show.
6944584	6946385	That poor guy is never going to email us again.
6946425	6950306	But if you want to have your emails ready to kill, please send them to mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
6950566	6954288	Just remember, we have Yakety Sax ready to go whenever we need it.
6954888	6957169	We also have the angst music ready to go for the FUs of the week.
6973499	6974340	Fuck you, Cryptic.
6975201	6976262	For your damn servers.
6977604	6981348	Make your servers hold more people so that I don't have to play a laggy STO.
6981588	6981888	The end.
6983923	6986224	F you to people that break into my car.
6986624	6999048	And apparently there is a dude, or somebody, I'm assuming it's a dude, that broke into my car last night because I had boxes in the back of my car to give to my co-worker who's moving.
6999728	7003049	And those boxes were of a microwave and computers and whatnot.
7003529	7006170	And so they thought, hey, look, microwave and computers.
7006670	7010151	So they broke the back window, pulled the box out, and go, hey, this is a box.
7010731	7011572	What the hell is this?
7012272	7018856	Unfortunately, under those boxes was my rifle bag with all my airsoft guns, and they decided to take that in protest.
7019477	7021398	So I am without airsoft guns.
7021458	7023019	So you gave a thief guns.
7023560	7024000	Good move, Loki.
7024020	7025081	I gave a thief fake guns.
7025341	7030384	Well, I gave him guns without batteries or any of the ammo, because he didn't take any of the ammo.
7030584	7031645	It was just sitting right there.
7032225	7040271	Whatever, you know, I don't care because I haven't played airsoft in over a year, so... Yeah, it's so sad, but... If I want more airsoft guns, I'll just buy more.
7042312	7043352	I have arcade stuff to play.
7043392	7045093	I don't have players often.
7045113	7054999	The weather's been crappy, so... It's unfortunate, but it's not like... I'm not sad by it at all.
7057237	7072894	um well if that's it for your FU of the week mine would be just more moving angst and cleaning and putting things in boxes and moving it and yeah it's everything that comes with moving but I'll be over it in a couple weeks when it's over I'm sure
7074184	7075025	Otherwise, things are good.
7075105	7076347	I don't have a lot to complain about.
7076407	7077428	Life is happy.
7077448	7077508	Yay.
7077568	7078590	Butterflies and sparkles.
7079451	7086480	Alright, a couple more news stories for you guys and then your chance to interact with us live on the phone on our Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio or 1-877-GAME-OLR
7090175	7097542	Yes, Dante's Inferno is getting some download content, which I think is bundled actually with the PlayStation 3 version.
7098463	7103528	Apparently someone got the game early, or downloaded the game early, and...
7105129	7106030	Thanks for watching!
7122361	7150648	so that's kind of neat but apparently if it's not in the PS3 version I know it's definitely not in the 360 version so if you do have the 360 you'll have to get it in April hopefully it is included in the PS3 version in which case you'll get it immediately but that's neat and I don't know if it's going to be free later on but it's apparently a trailer that's on the disc so
7152003	7152405	Alrighty.
7153569	7154773	I got one more story for you guys.
7154793	7157704	Are you going to pick up Dante's Inferno, by the way, just before I get to my thing?
7158439	7167123	No, because I have Borderlands, and I now have Bioshock 2 to play, and really I'll just pick up God of War 3.
7167743	7176927	Although Dante's Inferno looked kind of cool, and I'm interested just to kind of play through it mindlessly, but not right away.
7177127	7178888	I'll wait for the maybe drop in price.
7179328	7184250	And Final Fantasy XIII is right around the corner, so I really don't have time to play all these games.
7184310	7184691	It's just...
7186451	7202677	it's just too many games I'll probably put it in the queue of things to play like on my literal now that I use a rental game so I stop spending 60 bucks on games every week put it in my queue of things to play but you know one thing I'm learning you don't always get what's number one on your list right away it's not quite as effective as Netflix just so you know
7204037	7225362	Anyhow, one other story for you guys, and this does have to do with spending money Buying stuff on your computer using one of those digital distribution sites You know Steam, they are probably the kings of what's going on But there are some other websites that sell games too And one of them is GOG.com, GOG.com Or you might call them the good old games
7225962	7226323	DarkSakura.com
7244625	7255455	Well, obviously some publishers are not having that, but GOG.com or Good Old Games tries to kind of legitimize that by selling DRM-free old games.
7255916	7257898	And they got some big lands this week.
7258318	7268207	They got a deal with Activision Publishing to get some Sierra classics, because Activision has access to those classics now, that you can't even find on Steam.
7269028	7274913	Some of those games, by the way, that are out right now, the first two that were added, Arcanum of Steamworks and Magic Obscura.
7275653	7278215	Definitely an Obscura title because I haven't even heard of that one.
7278235	7279196	But this one I definitely knew.
7279736	7281678	Gabriel Knight, Sins of the Fathers.
7281698	7283519	I don't know if you ever heard of this game.
7283639	7284860	I've heard of the Gabriel Knight games.
7284960	7288243	Yeah, it's pretty cool because Tim Curry does a voice in the game.
7288263	7289624	It was one of his voice acting gigs.
7290224	7315150	6 bucks for each one of those titles they are supposed to be doing like several titles a week over the next few months so a lot of these old school classic games if you are curious and checking them out you can go to GOG.com granted it's not the same as when that LucasArts pack was available for what like 9 bucks or something some obscenely low price on Steam over the holidays but you know you can still find some good old classic games
7316490	7331762	I have plenty of games to play and I'm just trying to get through I'm still trying to sort my MAME ROM collection to eliminate all the crap I'm not going to use
7333277	7333998	There's a lot of it.
7334218	7336841	Several folks in chat chanting down with DRM.
7336881	7341807	Well, that's one of their big things is that they don't charge or they don't have really DRM on the games.
7342148	7344831	And so you can buy them and it's legitimate.
7344871	7351238	You can feel good karma and all that stuff and not have to worry about the whole abandoned ware and possibly getting viruses and all that stuff.
7351919	7352380	So there you go.
7354068	7358450	Anyhow, that's going to do it for the news tonight, and that's where we're going to go to our Skype line.
7358610	7364032	It is now open, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
7364212	7369554	We are taking your calls live on this Sunday evening, Super Bowl Sunday, February the 7th of 2010.
7370154	7373035	While we wait for some calls to come in, Loki's got some last-minute stories for us.
7374175	7375996	Yes, I do.
7377213	7380975	Hi, this is Spazinator Hi Spazinator, what's on your mind buddy?
7405790	7407211	Two things.
7408633	7416139	I don't know if you guys saw my tweets earlier this week, but I thought it would be worth mentioning.
7416559	7422324	There's an anime series that I think you guys may want to check out.
7422644	7426307	As far as I know, DarkSakura is into anime as well.
7426772	7428053	Wait, hold that thought, hold that thought.
7428093	7432496	Because speaking of anime series, I totally forgot to get into this at the top of the show, and I wanted to.
7432956	7437780	This weekend, I went to Japantown in San Francisco, and I totally thought of Jamie.
7438200	7444625	Because, well, A, I saw the taiyaki place that I know she really loves, and she likes to eat there, and it made me think of her.
7444965	7447507	And then we went to Japan Video and some of those places, and we were looking at...
7448487	7452128	Anime, and I saw the Ragnarok anime on DVD.
7452188	7454549	I guess they made like 25 episodes of a Ragnarok anime.
7454569	7455469	Yeah, they have a whole season.
7455489	7456689	It's actually pretty good.
7456789	7457530	I've watched most of it.
7457610	7457830	Have you?
7457850	7458770	Because it made me think of you.
7458810	7461771	I was like, I should get this for Jamie, and then I'm thinking, no, she probably already has it.
7461811	7466672	Well, no, actually, I downloaded it when it first started coming out on TV, and I never finished it.
7467132	7467512	Oh, okay.
7467652	7469093	And so it actually won.
7469213	7471393	It was pretty cute, pretty close to the game.
7471573	7476395	I'm already getting the new DS one, the US one, because I tried playing it in Japanese.
7476635	7476995	I tried.
7477595	7485339	But a completely random tangent right next to all that stuff is a little store called Pika Pika, which is a picture booth store.
7485399	7487400	It's one of the stores that's nothing but picture booths.
7487860	7493243	Now, I met up in Japantown with a bunch of people that I play World of Warcraft with, so it's like we had an IRL raid.
7493603	7498305	So we raided Pika Pika, and one of the photo booths there, and there was like six of us in the photo booths.
7498465	7503688	It takes like $9 to take a picture, but it's all like green platforms you stand on, and it puts in backgrounds.
7504108	7505709	We had so much fun.
7505729	7506309	Picture Club.
7506589	7508010	It was so much fun.
7508130	7511191	Like, seriously, I think these only exist in big cities.
7511511	7513252	I've seen one by Arcade Infinity, too.
7513332	7514492	There used to be one right next door there.
7515052	7517273	But if you have one of these in your town, it's a lot of fun.
7517553	7518154	Oh, yeah, totally.
7518234	7519154	Okay, sorry, Spazinator.
7519174	7519854	I got off topic.
7519874	7521355	But what was the anime you wanted to talk about?
7522895	7524756	It's called Dubslinger Girl.
7525636	7528417	I don't know if either one of you have heard of it, but it's...
7530370	7533212	There's two seasons of it.
7533372	7535714	Both are like 13 episodes long.
7536875	7556771	And the trick synopsis of it is this government agency over in Italy basically takes in kids that are basically dying and turns them into $6 million woman-type cyborgs and has them...
7558086	7563469	Do assassinations for like assassinate terrorists and stuff like that.
7564090	7567532	So wait, Gunslinger... Hold on, Gunslinger Girl was the name of the anime?
7568912	7569553	Yeah.
7569653	7570913	Have you ever heard of this, DarkSakura?
7570973	7571434	Yes, I have.
7571454	7572995	I wanted to try it out.
7573015	7574656	I just haven't had a lot of time.
7574756	7576997	Is this something available on the PlayStation 3 marketplace?
7577017	7579218	Because I know anime is like a big niche that they have on there.
7581119	7581720	Yes, it is.
7582160	7584001	There's season one and season two.
7584161	7584922	I think there's...
7587962	7592306	I don't like a lot of Season 3, but there is another season there.
7592366	7596529	I think it's like a reimagining of the entire series.
7597390	7601553	You may want to call it Season 2.5 if you want to call it that.
7601873	7603074	Okay, like a special, sure.
7604655	7615804	Yeah, but I have the entire Season 1 and Season 2, and I just finished up Season 2 the other day, and oh my God, it's epic.
7616724	7622730	We'll have to recommend that to the listeners and to the anime fans here in the studio as well.
7623610	7626573	Gunslinger Girl, okay, so I'm really excited about that.
7626773	7632038	Anything else on the PlayStation Network we should be checking out right now?
7643690	7647954	Yeah, it's something you kind of sort of touched on on your last show.
7648894	7655299	It's the new Music Guidance Sigma 2 table for Zen Pinball.
7656720	7661404	I just got that today and it's pretty good.
7663025	7668510	In fact, personally, I think it's a little bit better than some of the other tables that are currently available for the game.
7668730	7670111	I like Zen Pinball.
7670131	7671032	I'll have to check that out.
7671052	7672713	All right.
7673365	7676009	Yeah, I'd definitely give it a thumbs up on that.
7676189	7677191	Alright.
7677531	7681618	Well, let's get going so you can take more calls.
7681798	7682439	Alright.
7683160	7684402	Well, you have a good week, Spazinator.
7684422	7687667	Thanks for the phone call and we'll forgive you for the bad joke on Twitter earlier, okay?
7690678	7693120	Alright, you too buddy, bye
7708475	7710056	I guess maybe you can still get a one-day ticket.
7710737	7711437	And I'm going.
7711798	7713038	I'm going to PAX East.
7713619	7714980	Like, really, I have tickets.
7715320	7717641	I actually just bought a regular ticket.
7718022	7723545	I decided I didn't want to do the media thing because, A, PAX doesn't really do much for media, and that's fine.
7723685	7727248	I totally am cool with that, and I think that's actually the way I wish E3 was that way.
7728469	7736134	And so, you know, I'm going as a gamer, as a fan, just like the rest of you, and don't really want to have to work through all of PAX.
7736274	7737815	So I'm just going to have fun.
7738235	7739356	So I'll be around at the show.
7739456	7747819	I'm going to try, when the schedule comes out, I will try to find like a gaming lounge time, maybe with the DS game I enjoy, that I'll go be at.
7748019	7751540	And I'll let you guys know more about that when it gets a little closer to the show.
7751960	7752921	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7752941	7753261	Who's this?
7754081	7754621	Good day, sir.
7754641	7758663	This is Lieutenant Sal Tome of USS Takahashi, requesting permission to come aboard.
7759843	7761704	Are you a Star Trek Online addict as well?
7762604	7764085	Yeah, I just picked it up last night.
7764165	7764945	It's Ranma, everyone.
7765105	7765905	Yes, hi, how you doing?
7766186	7767186	Sir, you getting the lag too?
7769005	7769585	Not really.
7769985	7770305	Really?
7771345	7781347	Because, I mean, I don't think it's my graphics card, I think it's their servers, but I had to wait in the queue of 118, and it takes like five whole seconds to move in any direction.
7782067	7787348	I have not had that problem at all, and mind you, my video card is like almost three years old.
7788288	7792009	Yeah, mine's actually just under what the correct one is supposed to be.
7792709	7797210	But seriously, they say there's supposed to be increasing server capacity, but they haven't yet.
7798524	7801166	I don't know, I just haven't had that problem at all.
7802386	7811592	It may also be the difference in locations that we're at too, because right now I just hit memory alpha and my character's all like running all over the place and there's a ton of people there.
7812712	7814173	So maybe it has to do with location too.
7814593	7815194	Probably so.
7816214	7818696	So is this what you called in to talk about tonight, Star Trek Online?
7819396	7820857	Well, that too, that too.
7822613	7826756	First thing I want to talk about is something from a couple of podcasts before.
7826816	7832259	You mentioned about how it's possible for Steam to sell so many games at dirt cheap prices.
7832539	7832819	Yes.
7833679	7835360	I believe I have the answer for that.
7835540	7835881	Please.
7836521	7840683	Okay, I used to work in a video store and we would rent games, so on and so forth.
7841303	7847207	Once the rental of the game got to a certain point, we could sell it at a price because all the rentals...
7847907	7849648	made the money back on the purchase of the game.
7850228	7854230	My thing is, with Steam, once they have this game, they sell it at that price.
7854610	7861714	Once they've made the money back on selling the game, they can just cut the price to as cheap as they want and that's just extra cash for them.
7863362	7867206	But I would still think that the deals are based on percentages of sales.
7867246	7872211	That seems kind of odd that it would work based on how much of it sells, I guess.
7873633	7874373	I get what you're saying.
7874413	7875034	It makes sense.
7875114	7875535	But I don't know.
7875575	7881561	I think maybe the whole retail strategy to digital distribution seems a little apples to oranges.
7881621	7882642	I mean, you could be right, though.
7883062	7883523	I wouldn't.
7884668	7891150	Yeah, I mean, because when we rent these games, like there was one game, you know, we have like five copies of Mortal Kombat.
7891550	7900272	Three of them will be selling for like $30 and two will be selling for, I'd say, $40 because of the rental turnaround rate on those games.
7901112	7912595	I mean, if they get a game, they sell it at this price, they make the money back off of, you know, the licensing, the rights, the time it costs that they invested into it, then there you go.
7913581	7941001	well I was also just the mindset I mean honestly I always and still kind of think the reason for the sale is that you know assuming it is based off percentages those companies are still making five dollars off a game they would have made no dollars off of had it not been on Steam on a huge ass sale you know some money's better than no money a long forgotten game that got booted off of shelves years ago so I don't know good thought though I mean anything is possible and unfortunately until we know somebody on the inside at Steam that knows the agreements of the arrangements we just won't know
7941673	7943995	Yeah, but we can go off of that for the time being.
7944616	7944996	All right.
7945376	7945637	Fine.
7946637	7948099	Anything else you want to mention?
7948359	7952122	I just want to say thanks for taking a chance to listen to my podcast over the weekend.
7952523	7955105	I have to admit I downloaded it, but I didn't listen to it yet, but I will.
7955866	7956546	That's fine.
7956586	7957127	That's fine.
7957427	7963052	And if you're looking for good titles, I recommend Kido Tenshi Angelic Lair.
7963492	7964954	It's free on Netflix right now.
7965895	7968096	What are some good animes based off of video games?
7970469	7972660	Remember Tower of Druaga, that old video game?
7972781	7973042	I do.
7973752	7974772	That's become an anime.
7974792	7975993	I believe it's been licensed.
7976313	7976633	Interesting.
7976673	7979435	Well, they had kind of a renaissance of that game a while ago, too.
7979535	7981375	There's a new Duraga game, I think, on PS2.
7981415	7982416	That makes sense.
7982936	7983436	Very interesting.
7984277	7985457	One other quick question I have for you.
7986058	7991160	A movie I saw at the video store that looked hilarious, and I don't know, maybe Jamie knows of this, too.
7991580	8002325	Apparently it was a Japanese movie directed by the same guy who did Ichi the Killer, and it was advertised as The Sound of Music meets Dawn of the Dead.
8003593	8008157	That, I don't know, but I believe the director was Takahashi Mike, or Miike?
8008357	8017225	It looked hilarious from the box art, and I was wondering before I go out and either spend money on that or obtain it through questionable means, if it was worth my time.
8018726	8023731	Anything along those lines of Ichi Tequila, I keep hearing is well worth the purchase.
8027025	8033127	I'm using a website I should have used a long time ago and looking up Ichi the Killer on... The Hills Are Alive with Sound?
8034027	8035507	It has another name to it, though.
8036027	8042489	That's like the little tagline, I think, to the... It's... The Family Something was the name of it.
8042809	8045449	The Happiness of the Katakrys?
8045670	8046450	Yes, that's it.
8046890	8047590	That's the name of it.
8049985	8050885	I've not heard of.
8051005	8052907	The hills are alive with the sound of screaming.
8053587	8055428	The sound of music means still in the dead.
8055809	8056789	That was it.
8056870	8057870	That was the box I saw.
8057930	8059972	It's awesome because it made me lol.
8060132	8062193	It made me lol for real.
8064475	8067177	Alright, well maybe somebody else will call him later and tell me about that.
8067457	8070059	Alright Ranma, we're going to let you go so we can get more calls, but thank you as always.
8070099	8071340	And hey, have fun on Star Trek, okay?
8071640	8071940	I will.
8072361	8072741	Calm out.
8076817	8081598	1877-GAME-OLR 1877-GAME-OLR 1877-GAME-OLR 1877-GAME-OLR 1877-GAME-OLR 1877-GAME-OLR 1877-GAME-OLR 1877-GAME-OLR 1877-GAME-OLR 1877-GAME-OLR 1877-GAME-OLR
8101604	8103146	It's the one and only Legend of Zaku.
8103266	8104807	Well, how are you doing, Legend of Zaku?
8105468	8109331	Recovering from almost a hangover this morning.
8109451	8110812	Were you drinking before noon?
8110892	8111513	What's going on?
8111793	8114135	No, it was basically last night's drinking.
8114615	8115396	Oh, I see.
8115656	8120300	Let's just say that I drank to the point where I drank into places where...
8122281	8125563	Okay, okay, you've got to stop typing during the show.
8125743	8127343	Seriously, you can't type right now.
8127663	8128324	Go ahead.
8129404	8135126	But yeah, I just wanted to bring up that whole harmonic speculation about the licenses.
8135586	8136167	Oh yes, please.
8137567	8142249	Basically, the way I see it is that Konami, the only thing they have going for them right now
8142978	8143579	is lawyers.
8144320	8151669	In other words, they sued Rockstar over ITG and they managed to win that case single-handedly and got their franchise.
8151789	8154192	Because it was a complete rip-off of DDR.
8154772	8155473	I hate to say it.
8155493	8159819	You could probably say the same thing for whatever Harmonix is doing with whatever they...
8160279	8162340	We think they're doing with those licenses
8185558	8187119	before the whole rock band thing.
8187259	8196903	Harmonix was also not sued over Guitar Hero because the look and feel from Guitar Freaks was completely different, whereas with I in the Groove, the look and feel was the exact same as DDR.
8197003	8201785	I mean, right on down to the backgrounds and animations and pretty much the way the arrows looked.
8202125	8203005	They added mines.
8203745	8203826	Woo!
8205446	8210150	Well, we also have to keep in mind that, I mean, you could have said the same thing for Pump It Up.
8210210	8213352	Wasn't that almost a ripoff of DDR with those arrows?
8213612	8221798	I think, though, that went back, I want to say Konami and Namiro made an agreement many years ago because Pump It Up was actually first.
8223278	8225641	But anyhow, I don't want to rehash that old news.
8225941	8226282	I get it.
8226342	8230246	Okay, so the lawyers and litigation is how Konami keeps their franchises.
8230266	8245022	Well, that all depends on how Harmonix is actually going to approach this, whether or not they're actually going to reinvent the same four-panel dance paradigm that we've seen for more than a decade, or they're going to go into a new direction.
8246312	8250239	Chances are, if I was a betting man, I would say the latter.
8250860	8253145	Just because they're pretty good at innovating.
8254175	8256376	Pretty good at innovating within rhythm.
8258676	8259296	Here's the thing, though.
8259476	8260837	All of this is speculation, though.
8261037	8266198	They could be licensing these songs for Rock Band for some weird little pop expansion they're doing.
8266238	8267338	We don't know.
8268439	8274660	I don't see those songs in particular being something that would blend well with Rock Band completely.
8275401	8280502	The way I see it is that they're doing something outside of Rock Band with that.
8281451	8300499	or Rock Band 3 is something we haven't thought of yet Pax East is probably going to give us some clues because Harmonix is in Boston this is happening in their backyard so this is the perfect place for them to make an announcement I think Harmonix is the kind of company that will drop a bomb at Pax East
8300879	8313747	See, I would love to go and see it for myself, but since I was unemployed up until last week, there was no way I would have gotten tickets well in advance.
8314247	8316729	Well, congratulations on getting employment though.
8316769	8318570	That's good news, all things considered.
8319551	8323293	Right, but I guess time will tell.
8323923	8327905	I will give it my critical eye with my music games background and I'll let y'all know.
8327945	8332446	Right, of course, and you have to make sure you don't want to, don't give them the benefit of the doubt.
8332466	8332706	Try to
8348410	8365289	well try to like press them on some hard questions obviously not treading into NBA stuff but just try to challenge them that they're trying to sell you on something that you think is not going to be revolutionary I'll do my best
8365922	8371044	Alright, Zaku, any other thoughts here before we let you go?
8371244	8377246	Don't drink a 40 ounce of liquor because all that's going to do is purge your stomach.
8377806	8378726	Happened to me last night.
8379367	8380247	Some sage advice.
8380367	8381427	Have a good one, Zaku.
8382008	8382248	Right.
8382588	8382868	Later.
8383928	8386649	We'll go ahead and take one more call if someone wants to call in.
8386669	8389830	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8390370	8391531	Loki, anything to tide us over?
8392871	8394712	250GB hard drives coming out in Japan in March.
8396246	8396506	Yay.
8397567	8398667	Probably over here eventually.
8400609	8401109	Here's a good one.
8401769	8404371	Santa Hedgehog is rumored to be playable in Mario Galaxy 2.
8406562	8407003	I don't remember.
8427706	8428827	I do remember something about it.
8428847	8432128	No, there was a new Tetris game in development, but it's not the Dish Network thing.
8432168	8435590	It was something about somebody was making a new Tetris.
8435850	8436851	I wonder if the two are related.
8437771	8438051	I don't know.
8438131	8438472	Possibly.
8438652	8440333	It's going to cost you $2.99 a month.
8440773	8442173	Really, just play it free online.
8442213	8443474	You don't need to play it on your TV.
8443874	8445175	Tetranet for life.
8446416	8446996	Anything else.
8449031	8455120	According to Game Informer, LA Noire is no longer a PS3 exclusive.
8455461	8458245	Oh, it's hitting the Xbox 360 as well.
8460308	8461731	Another one lost.
8463294	8463854	That's too bad.
8464995	8465715	That would be pretty cool.
8466396	8467336	Whenever the hell it comes out.
8468437	8468997	Long ways away.
8470118	8477361	Speaking of something else that's not an exclusive anymore, High Voltage was bringing a brand new game, The Grinder, which is going to be a Supernatural first-person shooter game.
8477761	8479482	Originally going to be a Wii exclusive.
8479582	8483204	However, now it's coming to Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC as well.
8483864	8486306	And will probably look way better than the Wii version anyways.
8487046	8489287	Last call, by the way, for phone calls.
8489307	8492147	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8492167	8494508	If you want to call into the show, it's an empty line right now.
8494568	8496448	Super Bowl Sunday is a good day when everybody's distracted.
8496868	8502490	And cracked in a two-headed contest to have fans submit user-made graffiti.
8503290	8512332	And one of the pictures that got, I guess, won was of these two male agents making out, which is pretty awesome.
8515013	8515593	Interesting.
8517352	8536493	Huh, I, okay, whatever, hey That's all I have, that's it Alright I doesn't, oh, we just in the nick of time got another call Let's take this and we'll wrap it all up Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?
8537113	8539276	Hey, this is X-Link Hey, X-Link, what's on your mind, buddy?
8539864	8546710	Hey, I'm glad to, I was reading Kotaku earlier on today and realized that they're coming out with a new version of Blaster Master come tomorrow.
8547190	8547430	Uh-huh.
8547951	8550013	I know, well, did you listen to Part A tonight?
8550053	8554436	We had a joygasm over it in Part A. Oh, did you really?
8554496	8555017	I'm sorry.
8555157	8557399	I was having, we were having some issues.
8557419	8559080	Yeah, we know, Super Bowl, blah, blah, blah.
8559140	8561522	No, no, no, no, nothing with Super Bowl at all.
8561562	8562563	It was with the Step Kids.
8562703	8564225	All right, well, okay, fair enough.
8564245	8566847	Well, what is on your mind, though, at least about the Blaster Master game?
8566867	8567728	What are your thoughts on it?
8569030	8582598	I looked over the video they had out on YouTube and I gazzled myself pretty much because this was one of the first games I got back when I had my NES and I buy it with my own money and I absolutely loved it.
8582718	8584439	In fact, I had the World of Power book.
8586000	8586780	It was so good.
8586900	8589742	All those novels by FX9 and stuff?
8589762	8590702	Yes, I have a bunch of them.
8590722	8591543	Yes, I had that one too.
8591963	8592984	And the Simon's Quest book.
8593044	8593664	Both were epic.
8593784	8594805	I think I had the Metal Gear one too.
8596579	8599041	I was missing this too because a lot of my books were burnt down.
8599061	8610888	A lot of my old school stuff that the games I had, my PS1 games, a lot of those, I had back in my mom's apartment when I was moving from going from Orlando, Florida to Melbourne, Florida.
8611668	8613049	A lot of that stuff got burnt down.
8613189	8616151	There was an arson in my mom's apartment and a lot of that stuff got burnt down.
8616171	8619593	So I had to go online and refine the books, which...
8620812	8627358	A lot of books I got, but the Simon Quest and the Metal Gear, if you have them in good condition, are really valuable and really hard to find.
8627378	8630000	A lot of the text, though, at least, is available online.
8630020	8631821	You can read a lot of those novels online.
8631841	8634764	It's not the same thing, you know, collectors and all that.
8635124	8638167	But I do, just a complete random-ass fact about those books.
8638187	8643551	And for those that don't know what we're talking about, the World of Power were these books that they wrote about old NES games.
8643631	8647795	But since a lot of the 8-bit video games didn't really have stories that made for very good books...
8648195	8651238	A lot of times the authors would kind of add their own stuff to it.
8651278	8657743	Like, for instance, I believe the plot about Castlevania II had to do with some kid, like, warping himself into that world.
8657803	8661545	Like, it wasn't even really about Simon Belmont, but somebody... To no end, the Game Master.
8661606	8662306	His little sidekick.
8663787	8684128	but there were some extra characters in Blaster Master to make that story work too and here's the interesting thing I believe one of the characters was Eve which was I think like the name of the car or something or like was one of the robot characters they actually the programmers of Blaster Master made Eve they wrote her into the official canon and she was in the Game Boy game
8685336	8687697	And it's also from Part 2 from what I understand.
8687757	8693238	I believe there was an actual Part 2 for Blaster Master and they brought the actual plot line from the book into the game.
8693498	8694458	I think that was kind of neat.
8694998	8697219	Because Blaster Master was one of the better books.
8697619	8705000	And also the covers, a lot of times the covers were different from the actual game covers from the video game.
8705120	8708661	That's right, because they took out the gun from the Metal Gear cover.
8708981	8710162	Yeah, I remember that.
8710282	8711182	It can't promote violence.
8713862	8714642	It's a kid's book.
8714723	8715263	I mean, come on.
8715523	8717303	Good times down memory lane.
8717363	8717963	Good times.
8719844	8721084	They need to bring back those books.
8721124	8722704	Although I guess they do have them to some extent.
8723144	8726285	There's books about Halo, tons of books about World of Warcraft.
8726385	8728365	Well, they're always bringing back the Chujo Adventures.
8728405	8729966	I can see why they can't do it.
8730846	8733306	Get the permission from the people and redo it.
8733526	8736187	Alright.
8737717	8741338	But no, I was just mostly, I know you were looking for some calls, so I was called about that.
8741358	8747740	I was a guy really giddy about that, because I had a lot of my old school games, like Blaster Master was one of the first ones.
8747760	8749500	Of course, Castlevania was another one, too.
8749720	8751761	Castlevania 2, I remember spending hours on it.
8752441	8753161	I'm giddy, too.
8753201	8754142	I wish it was on PS3.
8754202	8761984	I was burning out my friend's Nintendo NES, because we had it on for 18 hours straight, because we didn't want to turn it off, and we wanted to go through and beat the game, so...
8763914	8767318	I'm excited, but I'm trying very hard not to get too excited.
8767658	8770681	I don't want to set the expectations too high for this game.
8771121	8772963	I'm just going to set the bar somewhere in the middle.
8773884	8775886	I don't want to get too excited and then be disappointed.
8775926	8776347	You know what I mean?
8776883	8777864	No, I hear you, I hear you.
8777884	8782846	That'd be one of those things, like, you get all gung-ho about, and it's like, man, when the heck did I do this in the first place?
8783006	8783467	Exactly.
8784047	8784647	All right, well, excellent.
8784667	8787909	We're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you so much for the call, and you know what?
8788009	8792912	Actually, when you called, like, about two other people called in at the same time, so you lucked out, so congrats.
8792932	8793392	No problem.
8793472	8793792	Thanks, man.
8793812	8794172	I appreciate it.
8795693	8797375	All right, that is going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
8797395	8799137	And I apologize to those folks that didn't get through.
8799977	8804281	But if you do want to still interact with the show, remember, we do take Twitter topics every week.
8804642	8805983	We do take emails every week.
8806804	8807124	You know what?
8807845	8816613	Any way you can figure out on the internet on all of our various websites to contact us, we will probably consider reading it on the show if you find us on one of those many, many websites.
8817013	8821257	I'm going to go ahead and let Loki finish up any last-minute stories he has while we go ahead and shut down the Skype line.
8821479	8822960	Terror Drome, Fighting Game, Horror Movie Characters
8844853	8845954	I've not heard of this either.
8846114	8846694	Interesting.
8846794	8850036	So you've got, you know, Freddy.
8851437	8856200	You've got Jason from the Friday the 13th movies.
8856460	8858221	You actually have Ash in there as well.
8859562	8860082	Chucky.
8861163	8862423	Lots of cool characters.
8862484	8863424	Oh, here's the full list.
8863984	8864985	Oh, it's under construction.
8865025	8865545	Thank you.
8866546	8871329	But they do have a demo available online, I guess, that you can download online.
8874292	8874893	That's awesome.
8875394	8877276	And I'll have to check that out.
8877737	8886209	But if you want to check it out, it's at Terrordrome-TheGame.com That's it.
8888472	8888913	Alright.
8889673	8892235	I had to link something in the chat room that has nothing to do with video games.
8892555	8893656	But you thought you'd link it anyway.
8893876	8894277	It's all good.
8894837	8895158	What is it?
8895638	8896178	Come have a look.
8896238	8897099	It's actually this right here.
8898680	8899641	I'm a big type nerd.
8901223	8909790	And I like that there's this garage where they actually managed to get it where if you're looking right from a certain angle, everything is perfectly aligned.
8910590	8913292	But as you go through, you see they've actually painted it all the way across.
8913853	8916415	That is pretty nerdy, I gotta say.
8917016	8918377	It's one of those optical illusions.
8918908	8924891	But, well, I'm also, you know, when I look at games, I actually have been paying more attention now to how they're designed, you know?
8925351	8928293	The look and feel of them, and I think that has a lot to do with that.
8928493	8930554	You know, you have to know your way around everything.
8930574	8932415	All right.
8932575	8934416	Loki, I still see you playing on the YouTube there.
8934436	8936237	Did you get your thing fixed, or what'd you do?
8936977	8939098	I argued, saying that it was under fair use.
8940179	8941980	Oh, and the audio's back.
8942740	8943061	Nice.
8943741	8944321	Oh, look at that.
8944401	8945502	See, arguing works.
8947512	8948833	I hope you don't get our account closed
8969811	8972133	I have a quick last minute sort of like update.
8972513	8978636	Every year at Orange Lounge Radio, our friends over at Understation Live do their March Madness.
8978876	8983919	But now they call it, I think they just call it USL Madness because it doesn't always happen in March.
8984359	8987821	But all the, you might remember a few weeks ago we got some phone calls.
8987841	8989181	They were collecting the top 25 games.
8990282	9019475	Well they compiled that and they got the first brackets up So some of the games are now doing battle So if you want to check that out, go to Orange Lounge Radio And go to our forums And you'll see there's a whole forum for March Madness And it says 2009 because we can't figure out how to update it But it actually is all the posts for 2010 And you can see all the brackets And you can vote in the first round But voting closes tomorrow night, Monday night So you can choose, like for instance I'll read a few of these matchups that are going on right now Civilization vs. Time Crisis Which is better?
9021085	9023633	Halo 2 vs. Para Para Paradise
9025359	9031742	Contra vs. Final Fantasy X Final Fantasy vs. Final Fantasy VIII Final Fantasy VIII
9050831	9061840	It might be too late, but you can go vote in the next round and have your voice heard on what is truly the best video game of all time, according to the OLR Network.
9063092	9066553	Alright, that's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
9066573	9070214	I know we're done a little bit early tonight, but that's the way it goes sometimes.
9070254	9072535	Sometimes we have a lot to say, sometimes we don't have as much to say.
9072615	9075476	So we're going to wrap it all up and get on out of here for the night.
9075876	9078717	But first, we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.
9079178	9080758	And I'll start with my final thought tonight.
9080838	9084719	My final thought is I should go to the arcade or something, play some arcade games.
9084739	9085260	That would be fun.
9085560	9086140	I haven't been in a while.
9086160	9086780	That sounds like fun.
9086800	9087420	It does sound like fun.
9087901	9088541	Maybe after moving.
9089241	9090261	Dark Sakura, your final thought.
9090902	9091862	Typography is life.
9092825	9093827	And Loki, your final thought?
9095269	9096911	It's really funny how... Your mic's off.
9098233	9100036	Really funny how my mic was off.
9100636	9107727	No, that just a simple little instructional guide on eHow can get your YouTube video back up even though it has copyright music in it.
9110427	9111207	We'll see you next time.
9139122	9141164	Alright, we'll be back to do it all again next week.
9141264	9142465	It is Valentine's Day.
9142826	9144547	Who knows what's going to happen next week.
9144607	9145448	So tune in.
9145888	9149391	Until then, that does it for another week here at Orange Lounge Studios.
9149431	9150012	Have a great week.
9150032	9152875	We'll see you next Sunday for more of Orange Lounge Radio.
9156858	9157318	See you next week!
9184712	9185915	Thanks for watching!
