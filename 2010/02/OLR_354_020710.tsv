0	18240	Tonight, February 7th, 2010, a new Sonic the Hedgehog game is announced.
18240	21360	Could you soon get premium Warcraft features on your iPhone?
21360	31640	And what first-person shooter is coming to Facebook?
31640	34480	I hope it's a game where I can shoot all my old friends from high school.
34480	35680	Hey, welcome back!
35680	40120	You're listening to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
40120	42560	Apparently we're going to have to see theme songs.
42560	46160	We're still having audio fail, even a week after having all our fun new equipment here
46160	47160	in studio.
47160	51680	Anyway, hi, we are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture,
51680	53320	and the gamer lifestyle.
53320	54320	I'm here with you every week.
54320	55320	My name is Rob Roberts.
55320	60600	Joining me, as always, say hello to the lady shouting fail fail over there in the corner.
60600	63120	Our very own fail blog here in house, Dark Sakura.
63120	64120	Jamie.
64120	65120	Fail!
65120	66120	How are you?
66120	67560	I win.
67560	70560	And also joining us tonight, say hello to Cookie Master Loki.
70560	71560	Hello.
71560	73000	How you doing, Cookie Master Loki?
73000	74720	We're almost out of cookies.
74720	75720	All right.
75720	79520	So, just so you know, we've renamed Loki, at least for tonight anyway, Cookie Master
79520	83440	instead of Tech Master because he baked cookies and brought them.
83440	86320	And I don't know about Jamie, but I like it when people bring cookies to the show.
86320	87760	I like cookies.
87760	88760	Yes.
88760	90380	So, tonight he is Cookie Master Loki.
90380	93000	But I'm sure he'll talk about tech here and there as well.
93000	96360	In fact, you've been kind of over there hammering on YouTube, right?
96360	98040	What's going on over there on YouTube, Loki?
98040	102600	Well, they just uploaded my new video and disabled all the audio because they're awesome
102600	103840	like that.
103840	104840	What happened?
104840	105840	Copyright music.
105840	106840	Yeah, copyright.
106840	109280	But there's tons of videos out there that have copyright music in them.
109280	110280	That's lame.
110280	111280	I'm sorry to hear that.
111280	112280	It's all right.
112280	113280	We'll find someplace else to upload it because YouTube sucks.
113280	114400	There you go.
114400	116440	Or you could just play the song backwards.
116440	117440	That's the other idea.
117440	118440	Then they won't know.
118440	120520	I just don't care.
120520	122160	I have a sad announcement real quick.
122160	123160	What's your sad announcement?
123160	127320	The person who is going to be our youngest guest host ever can't make it.
127320	128320	I'm sorry to hear it.
128320	130320	He fell asleep in the car and needs a new diaper.
130320	132720	I'm sorry to hear it.
132720	136200	What about video games, what do you have talked about tonight you think?
136200	140280	Probably daddy playing the game.
140280	141280	What game?
141280	145680	Well, right now I think Becky's husband, Chris is playing, um, Mass Effect.
145680	147720	I was gonna say everybody's playing Mass Effect 2.
147720	148720	Except us.
148720	149720	Yeah.
149720	150720	For some reason, I just kind of missed it.
150720	151720	Dan just went back and bought Bioshock.
151720	152720	Wow.
152720	153720	And he's been playing that.
153720	155640	Well, let's talk about our gaming weeks and what the kind of games we've been playing.
155640	156720	That's how we always start off the show.
156720	160360	But hey, if you are joining us live on this Sunday evening, uh, first of all, thank you.
160360	161360	Welcome.
161360	162360	And thanks for listening to us live.
162360	164760	I mean, if you're listening to us on the podcast, we still love that too.
164760	165760	So thank you guys very much.
165760	169360	But if you are listening live on this Sunday evening, Super Bowl Sunday, but you decided
169360	174120	to take a break from the Super Bowl list, join us in our chat room, chat dot orange
174120	178000	lounge radio.com to talk about all of tonight's video game topics, including the games we
178000	179360	have been playing dark soccer.
179360	180360	How was your gaming week?
180360	185400	I played a crap ton of Star Trek online, and then I realized, um, when I decided to go
185400	189520	on the quest to find deep space nine, that I just, my little character had been just
189520	193720	running around the promenade for about an hour and a half, just running around, doing
193720	196880	nothing, running around.
196880	197880	And that's about it.
197880	201400	Well, I just have some like solitaire.
201400	203280	You didn't play like actual solitaire on the computer?
203280	207000	I didn't even, Oh, on the iPhone, I was gonna say, do they even include solitaire on the
207000	208000	computer anymore?
208000	212760	Or is that, yeah, it's included that in spider solitaire and a few of it, few others hearts
212760	214280	and freestyle and all that crap.
214280	215280	All right.
215280	217440	Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?
217440	219560	It was pretty good.
219560	225560	I played more Borderlands and, um, that's still entertaining me.
225560	229040	Uh, more Grand Theft Auto finally made it.
229040	233980	I'm in the top 100 players now, um, for true skill rankings.
233980	236100	So I'm in like the mid nineties now for that.
236100	237600	That's pretty awesome.
237600	243400	And I'm working my way up just the cumulative, uh, ranked death match stats.
243400	248280	So, um, I think I'm, I don't know, varies depending on how much I play it.
248280	252360	Um, I think I'm around two 30 something right now.
252360	256760	Um, and then I purchased a Bioshock two.
256760	260160	So I played a little bit of that and that one's actually pretty cool.
260160	262340	Very similar obviously through the first game.
262340	263340	Now wait a minute.
263340	265680	I thought Bioshock two was now till Tuesday, but you have the hookup, right?
265680	268920	It's not out till Tuesday, but it's pretty awesome.
268920	275600	Um, so yeah, uh, definitely, um, we're checking out, especially if you'd like the first game.
275600	279760	It seems like there's going to be a lot of similarities between this game and the last
279760	280760	one.
280760	281760	But, um, so far I'm digging it.
281760	282760	I don't know.
282760	284360	Did they have multiplayer in this one?
284360	285360	They do.
285360	286360	Yeah.
286360	287360	Fun.
287360	288360	That's going to, that's going to be the big kicker right there.
288360	291520	Cause that was one kind of glaring omission in the first one and what a lot of people
291520	292520	were clamoring for.
292520	294760	So I think that's probably the whole sale of the game right there.
294760	297360	I don't know if I'll even play the multiplayer though.
297360	300360	I, it just doesn't seem like anything I'd be interested in.
300360	301360	Yeah, I know.
301360	304080	Whenever I play those multiplayer shooting games, I get raped in the face and that's
304080	305080	not a lot of fun.
305080	306080	Well, not necessarily that.
306080	309920	It just seems like tacked on or something, but whatever.
309920	310920	So that's it.
310920	311920	All right.
311920	313480	Um, my gaming week, kind of the same old stuff.
313480	317280	I've been playing more Bayonetta and world of Warcraft and um, you know, some of those
317280	318280	games.
318280	321080	The only new game I really checked out this week was one of the new Xbox live arcade games
321080	322400	that they have called chime.
322400	326640	Uh, somebody on Twitter had posted, Hey, if you like luminous, you should play chime.
326640	330520	And yeah, I could definitely see where somebody is making the comparisons between chime and
330520	331520	luminous.
331520	332720	They're both puzzle games.
332720	335160	They're both heavily involved with music.
335160	340120	They both have a beat line that sweeps across the screen and they have very similar looking
340120	342600	screens, might I say, uh, that affects the gameplay.
342600	345960	But where the games get very different is that, you know, you could say luminous is
345960	348780	somewhat of a Tetris inspired game.
348780	351960	Chime is like, I'm going to get really old school here and I bet half the listeners don't
351960	353160	even know what I'm talking about.
353160	356000	Chime is like the dallion Opus on the game boy.
356000	357960	Anyone ever played to dallion Opus?
357960	358960	Okay.
358960	360360	A while back.
360360	361360	Yeah.
361360	363640	It's one of these games here since you probably haven't played it.
363640	364640	Here's what it is.
364640	368820	It's basically like you have all these shapes that you're trying to put into and they're
368820	372400	all square based, but they might be in an L shape or a jagged shape and don't think
372400	376280	just Tetris pieces because sometimes they're like five or six blocks in a row.
376280	381520	Um, and uh, you, you try to fit them into this square or like, you know, some other
381520	382640	type of geometric shape.
382640	383640	I don't know.
383640	387600	It's kind of like tangrams, but all based around Tetris style shapes, if that makes
387600	388600	any sense at all.
388600	389600	I don't know.
389600	390600	You try to kind of fit them in there.
390600	396420	So Chime is about trying to make three by three squares as fast as you can out of these
396420	400320	odd shapes, which sound, it's a little harder than it sounds.
400320	405520	Um, and so as you build these squares on the play field, there's nothing to do with dropping
405520	406820	blocks or anything.
406820	411160	You, uh, actually have free form to put the, put things down wherever you want on the play
411160	412160	field.
412160	415400	Uh, but yeah, I have this odd fascination to still want to work from the ground up,
415400	419160	even though, um, the pieces don't fall or anything like that.
419160	422840	You just kind of can rotate them however you want and put them on the board.
422840	428720	Ray Iannami in our chatroom, chat.orangelandrater.com, uh, Tetro, Tetro, Tetromino's, I think it's
428720	429720	called.
429720	430720	I think that's it.
430720	431720	Yeah.
431720	432720	What you're talking about there.
432720	433720	Same kind of idea.
433720	437280	Um, so anyway, here's the thing is that as you build these blocks, your multiplier goes
437280	438760	up the faster you build them.
438760	443080	And, and oddly enough, yeah, it enhances the music as you build.
443080	449120	Uh, there's songs by Moby, one of the guys from Orbital, uh, Philip Glass has a song
449120	450860	in there, which I thought was totally random.
450860	454200	So there's some, actually some big name talent in the game, probably only about five songs
454200	458480	in the game, but it's only a $5 game and I don't know, maybe there'll be expansions later.
458480	464540	Um, but anyhow, the, the beat sweeper will kind of sweep out your crap if you leave it
464540	465540	behind too long.
465540	469800	Like if you've let these isolated pieces that didn't get formed into blocks, it, uh, the
469800	474120	beat sweeper will filter them out after it gets hit maybe like five times and then they
474120	477700	all flush out and you lose your multiplayer, multiplier.
477700	483160	So, um, it's good for cleaning up the board, but it's bad for your score.
483160	485000	So that's the gist of Chime.
485000	487280	Um, it's actually kind of a neat little puzzler.
487280	492520	I, I, I thought it was kind of cool and, uh, the music was very trancy, zoney, but I thought
492520	494880	it was decent for a game like that.
494880	498400	And best of all, it's only $5, even though it's only five songs.
498400	502280	Now here's the thing, is that the game is supposed to go for charity.
502280	506880	Like they, they really advertise heavily in the game that 60% of the purchase price goes
506880	510760	to these various children's charities and you can go online and look.
510760	514540	What I thought was a little weird though is that they actually, as part of the sales pitch
514540	518760	of the game say, buy this game and feel good about supporting charities.
518760	523440	Oh, and you get 50 gamer score just for buying the game.
523440	527680	Because there's an achievement that is called something like, and I'm paraphrasing here,
527680	529980	feel good about yourself, 50 gamer score.
529980	532840	You can feel good about yourself and the purchase you've made of this game.
532840	536920	And it just gives you basically 50 gamer score for, I guess, going to the title screen.
536920	540060	I thought that was a little weird, like, yeah, I get it.
540060	541060	It's for charity.
541060	542060	It's a good thing.
542060	543060	Da da da.
543060	548280	But you're essentially buying gamer score if you think about it that way and it's, it's
548280	551840	not that I necessarily have a problem with that, with the charity angle, but the fact
551840	556200	that it's kind of marketed like that is a little, I don't want to say off-putting, but
556200	557640	that's the best word I can think of.
557640	561280	I would say though that it's more of like a, just a little way of saying thank you for
561280	563480	your donation.
563480	567440	I think that badge should be worth zero gamer score if that's the case.
567440	571600	Like I'm okay with there being like a little badge of pride, like, yay, have your warm
571600	573640	fuzzies for buying our charity game.
573640	577460	But I don't think it should be worth any gamer score and I don't think they should be advertising
577460	580960	like, hey, if you buy this game, we'll give you 50 gamer score just for getting it.
580960	585960	Like, I don't know, for me that just kind of, it just seems like it opens the floodgates
585960	587600	to all this kind of like devious behavior.
587600	591140	Like I understand it's for charity and maybe like Microsoft kind of let them get away with
591140	592140	that for all that.
592140	593640	And I'm not trying to like knock the game.
593640	597600	It just, when I kind of looked at that, I kind of made one of those raised eyebrow faces
597600	602200	of that's, that ain't right, that, that ain't right.
602200	607240	But hey, it is for charity and heck, what games anymore are only five bucks on Xbox
607240	610880	Live and the music, you know, some good talent.
610880	614680	It's a little bit ambient and not, well, at least the demo song, like I don't know what
614680	615760	other songs are in the game.
615760	617200	I didn't watch the trailer or what have you.
617200	619640	So I'm assuming there's some other fast paced stuff.
619640	624920	But I think for just like a good little chill out game, five bucks is not asking too much.
624920	630120	And yeah, despite my little issue with the 50 gamer score for free, it is a feel good
630120	633160	thing that you can do like, hey, I bought this game and the money's going to charity.
633160	634480	So that's pretty cool.
634480	638920	So that was pretty much my gaming week, all things considered.
638920	641720	So those are pretty much the games I was playing.
641720	642720	How about you guys in chat?
642720	644400	How was your gaming week?
644400	651200	Some guys in chat kind of talking about the charity thing I was just talking about chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
651200	655800	Kevin DDR in chat says, only thing that irritated me was the different choice of pieces on different
655800	656800	songs.
656800	660440	I think that's something that fundamental to the gameplay strategy would stay consistent.
660440	661440	Interesting.
661440	666160	Kevin DDR said, also said, I assumed achievements generally got the amount of points based on
666160	668320	the relative difficulty of the achievement.
668320	671080	I guess, unfortunately, some developers don't want to do that.
671080	674880	Very good point because that 50 gamer score achievement is like the biggest one in that
674880	677520	game because they only have 200 to work with.
677520	681640	And the rest of the achievements are, some of them are fairly difficult, at least from
681640	683320	the little bit I played.
683320	684820	So there you go.
684820	687360	Some comments from chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
687360	688360	Some housekeeping tonight.
688360	693520	Of course, we always like to plug our Twitter and our Facebook, www.Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
693520	697200	If you want to follow us on Twitter, we do a segment of the show called Twitter topics
697200	701420	up a little later where you guys can get your questions and your story suggestions done
701420	702480	right here on the show.
702480	706400	We like to pitch ourselves as the show where every gamer has a voice.
706400	708680	So we want you guys to be heard.
708680	713300	Facebook is also another way you can follow us at Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.
713300	714920	And you can join our little Facebook club there.
714920	718400	And we like to post little updates with what's going on behind the scenes.
718400	720080	Plenty of other places you can interact with us.
720080	724040	If you want to see more, because we're on like Last.fm and Steam, if you want to see
724040	729860	everything, just head to our website, www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com and look at the little box in the corner that
729860	731160	says extended play.
731160	735260	And there's all these different links to all the places where we have little communities
735260	736260	and so forth.
736260	741600	Speaking of community, we want to thank the community at AllGames.com, www.AllGames.com.
741600	745520	It's All Games Radio and it's the place where we do tape our show live every Sunday night.
745520	749760	And as I always say on the show, if you don't like what you hear from us, maybe one of the
749760	754160	other shows on the network is more your cup of tea because as mentioned before, I think
754160	757680	Jamie mentioned, everybody she knows is playing Mass Effect 2, but we're all sitting here
757680	761480	going, well, we just really haven't been playing that because I've been too busy playing Bayonetta
761480	767520	and Raiding and Dark Soccer has been too busy playing Star Trek Online and so forth.
767520	770520	But I'm sure there's lots of other shows where they're talking about Mass Effect 2 nonstop.
770520	772320	So if that's more your cup of tea, hey, cool.
772320	776400	But if you do like our show, one last little plug, please visit iTunes, search for Orange
776400	779080	Lounge Radio and leave us a nice little review.
779080	784800	iTunes, by the way, recently changed the podcast page format to kind of match the rest of the
784800	786480	CDs and things in the marketplace.
786480	790160	So if you go visit Orange Lounge Radio, you can see like the most popular shows in our
790160	793740	feed and so forth, although I think it's a little early to really be tracking those type
793740	795720	of statistics, but I thought it was neat.
795720	800720	You can see the little cover arts of the shows that it suggests, like people who listen to
800720	804400	Orange Lounge Radio also like, and it shows all the little cover art.
804400	807100	You know who the number one show is that suggested?
807100	810240	People who also listen to Orange Lounge Radio also like, you know what the number one show
810240	811240	is?
811240	812240	In the list?
812240	813240	Any guesses?
813240	814240	Do tell.
814240	816000	Bobby Black Wolf, our good pal Bobby is the number one suggestion.
816000	819600	Of course he is because, you know, we're on right back to back on all games radio.
819600	821960	I'm sure we're number one on his list too.
821960	824400	All right.

831300	836400	Tiger Claw says, hey, this just in, Dante's Inferno ad just played during the fourth quarter
836400	840560	because they're watching the Super Bowl right now with the tagline, hell awaits, which if
840560	843840	I remember it, wasn't there some controversy that they weren't going to air that promo
843840	844840	because of the tagline?
844840	847040	They just made them edit it so it wasn't saying go to hell.
847040	848040	I see.
848040	849040	That's right.
849040	850040	It was going to say, go to hell.
850040	851040	Now it's hell awaits.
851040	852040	Who cares?
852040	853040	It doesn't matter.
853040	854040	Little weird.
854040	855040	I did play the demo for that game.
855040	856040	It was, it was neat.
856040	857720	It's kind of God of War-ish, but fun.
857720	858720	Yeah.
858720	860920	So not that, I mean, being God of War is not a bad thing.
860920	861920	All right.
861920	863160	Let's get into some gaming news.
863160	865900	Lots of gaming news this week, surprisingly enough, we're really starting to kind of kick
865900	871320	into the year and all the game news and Loki starting us off with some big news, right?
871320	872320	Yes.
872320	874720	Um, this is, I don't know if it's completely big news.
874720	878240	I mean, kind of, we could have figured this out pretty simple.
878240	882700	Uh, Project Needlemouse, you know, the project that they were working on that was a 2D Sonic
882700	883700	game.
883700	884700	Well, guess what?
884700	885700	It's Sonic 4.
885700	887600	Oh my God.
887600	889800	That's a surprise, except it's not.
889800	895140	Um, what is kind of unique about it is it's going to be available only as an episodic
895140	898320	game and it's available on all the different download services.
898320	905120	We wear PlayStation Network, Xbox Live, um, so it's kind of cool.
905120	912020	And I guess the first episode will be available this summer and, um, hopefully it's good.
912020	914080	I don't know.
914080	915820	I'm just not that excited about it.
915820	916820	That's all.
916820	921020	Is it because maybe there hasn't been like a really, really like OMG squee in my pants
921020	922800	exciting Sonic game?
922800	926020	Because they always say, oh, we're going to do what people wanted us to do.
926020	928120	And then they fuck it up somehow.
928120	931240	You know, it's, I don't know.
931240	932880	Some comments in our chat seem to agree.
932880	939040	Ray Iannami says, can Sega not fuck up Sonic 4?
939040	940880	Dark Sakura, I know you're a big Sonic fan girl.
940880	942880	What was your reaction to the trailer?
942880	944880	Squee?
944880	947080	I'm going to take a cookie.
947080	949520	Yeah, you better eat that last cookie before I do.
949520	952640	But here's, no, no, no, I don't need any more cookies.
952640	958800	But here, um, I have to admit, I, even though the trailer didn't show much, I mean, it just
958800	963800	kind of showed the whole idea of, hey, we're making a new Sonic game in the original Genesis
963800	967520	game canon, which we haven't touched in what, 15 years, I think.
967520	969040	So maybe longer than that.
969040	970040	I don't know.
970040	971040	But it is the updated model.
971040	972040	Right.
972040	974420	And what I thought was interesting is that, you know, the little glimpse of gameplay you
974420	981040	see was a very Sonic 3 corkscrew looking thing that just looked very souped up in 3d.
981040	985880	Like, it's interesting, Mega Man 9 has sort of opened the floodgates to this kind of stuff,
985880	986880	in a way.
986880	987880	I don't know.
987880	990640	Do you think this was inspired by the success of Mega Man 9, or do you think Sega's just
990640	991960	finally getting the hint?
991960	996360	People just want the old shit with a new coat of paint, or what?
996360	1001720	Well, I've noticed, and this is almost with any type of genre, be it art, music, whatever,
1001720	1007280	a lot of times you get this going towards the bigger the better, the whole, you know,
1007280	1011560	brand new, shiny, 3d, whatever, digital.
1011560	1016600	But there comes a phase in everything that you go back to the old way of doing.
1016600	1020080	You know, you want the classic look, you want the classic play.
1020080	1024160	You know, else we wouldn't have, you know, Sonic 4, we wouldn't have the new Mega Man
1024160	1025160	games.
1025160	1030640	I mean, shoot, even art's done the same thing, like right after the Victorian age, you know,
1030640	1035360	we kind of around the same time there were people that were going back to the old handmade
1035360	1036780	way of doing things.
1036780	1039420	So I think it's just culture.
1039420	1040420	It's going to happen.
1040420	1041420	It was bound to happen.
1041420	1042880	History repeats itself kind of thing?
1042880	1043880	Exactly.
1043880	1044880	Interesting.
1044880	1045880	Some comments in chat.
1045880	1047480	Hitstun says, well, Sega did a great job with Outrun 2.
1047480	1048840	There is hope.
1048840	1052520	I'm not sure if we're thinking of the same game here, but there was an Outrun game.
1052520	1053520	I don't think it was Outrun 2.
1053520	1056160	There was an Outrun game on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.
1056160	1058800	Yeah, Outrun 2000, that was it.
1058800	1059800	Not that long ago.
1059800	1061200	And that was kind of cool.
1061200	1065340	Like for a, it wasn't like, OMG, best game ever.
1065340	1068840	But for it, like a little arcade racing game that kind of invoked the old style of Outrun,
1068840	1069880	I enjoyed it.
1069880	1072360	I think I did buy the full version and played it a little bit.
1072360	1073360	It was fun.
1073360	1074360	It had magical sound shower.
1074360	1075360	And that's the important thing.
1075360	1076360	It sure did.
1076360	1077360	It was.
1077360	1078360	It was magical sound shower.
1078360	1079360	Uh, let's see.
1079360	1080360	And some other comments in chat room.
1080360	1083920	Uh, Frisbee says, I think this is Sega's final try.
1083920	1084920	Interesting comment.
1084920	1089000	Do you think that if this doesn't live up to the hype that Sonic's done, it's, it's
1089000	1091120	a done franchise?
1091120	1092920	Bury it?
1092920	1094520	I think Sonic isn't going to die.
1094520	1096720	No, I don't think Sonic could die either.
1096720	1100920	Something to think about, even if Sonic 4 tanks, which I highly doubt it will, I think
1100920	1104080	they're doing the right thing and invoking the past here.
1104080	1109240	Even if, for whatever crazy ass reason Sonic 4 tanks, let's not forget, Mario and Sonic
1109240	1113280	at the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics and all that stuff was huge on the Nintendo
1113280	1114280	Wii.
1114280	1118400	So Sonic as a character, I think still has a lot of kind of clout, if you will.
1118400	1123480	It's just that oddly enough, if Sonic 4 were to tank, which again, I don't think it will,
1123480	1126600	uh, Sonic would mainly exist in Nintendo franchises.
1126600	1129360	Isn't that weird?
1129360	1130360	Little.
1130360	1135040	Like it blows my mind, you know, and I was gaming back in the day, you know, as all of
1135040	1139640	his hosts were back in, you know, 90 and 91 when all these systems was Mario versus Sonic
1139640	1140640	and so forth.
1140640	1144800	It'd just be interesting if Sonic 4 were to tank, I think Sonic would just kind of have
1144800	1146720	to become a Nintendo character in all their games.
1146720	1149720	That'd pretty much be how it would exist, but I don't think it will tank.
1149720	1151320	What about the episodic nature of the game?
1151320	1155400	Do you think the episodic nature is a little weird or do you think that's just where games
1155400	1157080	are going these days?
1157080	1159540	I think it's just the way things are going.
1159540	1163840	It's gonna suck for them because now, since they're not putting out a full retail version,
1163840	1169020	I'm assuming it's gonna be cheaper and if people really hate the game, they're not out
1169020	1170720	as much money.
1170720	1175080	Which is good for the consumer, bad for Sega.
1175080	1178680	Do you think maybe they're just doing this so that by the time they put out episode 1,
1178680	1182560	episode 2, episode 3, they make about as much money as they would have if they just put
1182560	1184360	the game out on DVD, Blu-ray?
1184360	1188000	Pretty much, but that's assuming if everybody buys all the, you know, parts to it.
1188000	1190000	I guess that's a good point.
1190000	1192640	Alright, chat.orangehonestrader.com if you want to comment on this.
1192640	1196520	Was there anything else for this story, Loki, you wanted to add?
1196520	1200880	Yeah, I was also gonna say that one other platform that it's supposed to be coming out
1200880	1205640	on is the iPhone and that's kind of typical with anything nowadays.
1205640	1210200	Of course, I'm gonna assume since it's on the iPhone, it's gonna control like shit.
1210200	1211200	That's just my guess.
1211200	1214320	That is a little weird that it's coming to the iPhone because, you know, I'm not a big
1214320	1218120	fan of all these games getting adapted to the iPhone because the touch thing is a little
1218120	1219120	weird.
1219120	1222120	But, I don't know.
1222120	1226160	Some comments, more comments from our chat room, chat.orangehonestrader.com.
1226160	1229840	Tigerclaw says, the fact that the game is episodic probably means you will have your
1229840	1232440	epic boss battle against Doc Robotnik.
1232440	1233440	Wasn't that a given?
1233440	1238160	You have every stage, you always have to have your Doc Robotnik battle at the end?
1238160	1239560	That's every stage, right?
1239560	1244040	Oh, Tigerclaw says, actually, he's correcting that you will not have your epic boss battle
1244040	1245560	against Doc Robotnik.
1245560	1249520	So maybe that like you have like mini-bosses.
1249520	1251520	I don't know how that would work.
1251520	1255080	SSJ100Matt says, it should have Michael Jackson music in it.
1255080	1259140	Well, I don't know if that's gonna be very possible at this point unless they were working
1259140	1264360	in secret, you know, more than a year ago, but I somehow doubt that is the case.
1264360	1269220	Well, I think all of us in studio kind of agree though we will pick up Sonic 4, at least
1269220	1270220	check it out.
1270220	1274240	I know I will, because I do love the old Sonic games and I'm all about checking out the new
1274240	1275240	one.
1275240	1277680	I'm sure, I know Jamie's gonna buy it, I don't even have to ask her.
1277680	1280200	Matt, will you buy it?
1280200	1281200	Nope.
1281200	1282200	One hold out.
1282200	1284540	Why not, dare I ask?
1284540	1288080	Because I haven't bought any of the Sonic games, I just don't care.
1288080	1289320	All right.
1289320	1291920	It's not really a game that I really got into.
1291920	1297640	Well, maybe Loki will care about this, I know I sure did because I let out the biggest fangirl
1297640	1302540	scream when I saw this, like seriously, I'm not even joking, when I saw this last week.
1302540	1306000	Talk about out of right field, okay, this came out of nowhere.
1306000	1312520	Sunsoft, remember they reformed, not that long ago, announced that Blaster Master Overdrive
1312520	1313880	is on its way out.
1313880	1319200	That's right, a remade new version of Blaster Master, although I do not believe this is
1319200	1320320	like a remake.
1320320	1325040	It is actually a sequel of the NES classic, we're just kind of forgetting that, you know,
1325040	1329280	Blaster Master 2 on Genesis and the Game Boy one never happened, but this is the sequel
1329280	1334880	to Blaster Master will be coming out on WiiWare for 1000 Wii points.
1334880	1338000	Here's what I think is the biggest twist out of this whole thing.
1338000	1343720	They said, oh yeah, and the game, it's coming out Monday, as in tomorrow.
1343720	1347920	As in, we've kept this a secret for however long we've been working on this and hey, now
1347920	1349360	it's out now, you can buy it.
1349360	1352760	And there's even a little trailer out there that shows some of the gameplay, I'm playing
1352760	1358640	a little bit of it in studio because awesome enough, it has a remixed version of the theme.
1358640	1362840	I don't like the remixed version of the theme, it kind of like fucks it up.
1362840	1367120	You know what, nothing is ever going to be as good as the original, that's really what
1367120	1368120	it is.
1368120	1369120	I don't like this one at all.
1369120	1371160	But this is not bad, it could have been a lot worse.
1371160	1379200	But you could definitely see it 16 by 9, the overhead stages look a lot different.
1379200	1384880	I don't know, this game just kind of has more of a Metroid look to it, which I'm all over
1384880	1385880	that.
1385880	1386880	That's pretty sweet.
1386880	1391920	Yeah, it's like some of these overhead levels have like ice themes and kind of like more
1391920	1400680	cavern themes, whereas I don't remember that being the case in the first one.
1400680	1406520	So yeah, Blaster Master Overdrive out Monday and yeah, you should have been there when
1406520	1407520	I read this.
1407520	1411600	I was just like, oh my god, oh my god.
1411600	1415320	I started flailing all about, it's pretty cool.
1415320	1418160	So yeah, 1000 Wii points and that comes out on Monday.
1418160	1421760	I'm assuming Loki's not going to be buying that, but I will.
1421760	1422760	Probably not.
1422760	1423760	Dark Sakura?
1423760	1427400	Yeah, maybe, they'll probably be up Dan Valley.
1427400	1431080	Now Loki, which would you rather play, Sonic 4 or Blaster Master Overdrive?
1431080	1432080	Blaster Master.
1432080	1433080	Oh, okay.
1433080	1435280	I had to ask, I had to.
1435280	1436920	Dark Sakura, what do you got?
1436920	1441600	Well it was bound to happen, I think that it was expected, you know, maybe sooner rather
1441600	1448280	than now, but Xbox Live is going to be canceling out support for the original console and that's
1448280	1451040	going into effect on April 15th.
1451040	1457320	And it's also not just the console, but for games that are compatible with both the 360
1457320	1458960	and the old Xbox.
1458960	1465320	So they're basically saying that because more people now are really on the Xbox 360, that
1465320	1470080	that's what they want to focus their power on and cut the support so they can focus more
1470080	1472880	fully on the newer system.
1472880	1476920	In other words, buy Halo 2, because that's, yeah, that's really the Xbox game everybody's
1476920	1477920	still playing.
1477920	1480160	I mean, yeah, I guess there's some others, maybe Counter Strike and a few others here
1480160	1482640	and there, but it's really all about the Halo 2.
1482640	1487080	Yeah, they were saying that Halo 2 was the top usage.
1487080	1491000	I think Halo 2's been the top game on Xbox, original Xbox of course, ever since the game
1491000	1492000	came out.
1492000	1494960	And you know, there's a lot of people that feel that Halo 3 did not really, and I would
1494960	1498200	say I'm one of them, didn't really live up to Halo 2 in some ways.
1498200	1501040	Well they're saying also that the other big thing is that the changes that they want to
1501040	1506780	make to the service are, as I say, incompatible with the original games, with the old games.
1506780	1510800	And I think a lot of people are already aware of this, but just in case you hadn't heard,
1510800	1515940	one of those big hindrances is that, you know, a lot of people asking, when can we have more
1515940	1517900	than a hundred people on our friends list?
1517900	1520220	We want to increase the number of people on the friends list.
1520220	1524140	And the reason why they can't do it is because of original Xbox.
1524140	1529820	It's basically hardwired into games like Halo 2 and so forth that Xbox Live only has a hundred
1529820	1531340	slots on it, basically.
1531340	1536760	So that's one of the big things that getting rid of the original Xbox games and shutting
1536760	1539380	down Halo 2 and so forth will free up.
1539380	1543400	And I would say by the end of the year, probably whenever the patch comes out for Natal, your
1543400	1548320	friends list is going to get a big bump and you'll be able to have 250, 500, maybe even
1548320	1549320	unlimited friends.
1549320	1550320	I don't know.
1550320	1553640	And I'm sure there are some other technical components that we're just not aware of because
1553640	1557840	we haven't thought of them yet, but there's some other things that they have to shut off
1557840	1559460	these games for.
1559460	1564380	But on the flip side, there's a lot of, as you can understand, ticked off people still
1564380	1570400	playing the original Xbox, still playing Halo 2, haven't upgraded to Xbox 360 yet that are
1570400	1572740	very sad about this news.
1572740	1573740	What do you guys think?
1573740	1574740	Too bad, so sad?
1574740	1576300	It's time to give it up and put it away?
1576300	1578160	Or do they make a case?
1578160	1581020	Maybe Microsoft needs to find a way to still support this.
1581020	1582020	Who cares?
1582020	1586300	I mean, seriously, how many people are still playing the original Xbox, upgrade, get a
1586300	1587300	new system?
1587300	1589900	I mean, it's bound to happen that they're going to shut off servers.
1589900	1594620	I mean, just because you're paying for it now, okay, great, you know, that you're paying
1594620	1598340	for it month to month, well, now you're not.
1598340	1600820	So I don't know.
1600820	1603580	I don't really feel sad about these people.
1603580	1608140	I do find it strange, okay, the original Xbox games couldn't be patched or whatever, I get
1608140	1614700	that, but I do find it strange that Microsoft won't find a way to still let Halo 2 be playable
1614700	1616540	on the 360.
1616540	1617540	You know what I mean?
1617540	1621780	Like via a patch or via, you know, because Halo 2 is an on-demand game, it's a download
1621780	1626940	game, so that you could fix it, so that you could still play it on Xbox 360 at least.
1626940	1630140	You know, fix whatever is the problem with the friends list and play it that way.
1630140	1632300	You would think they would do that, but they're not.
1632300	1636400	Tigerclaw does bring up a good point, though, in our chat room, chat.orangeontrated.com.
1636400	1639540	People can still play Halo 2 multiplayer if they get the PC version.
1639540	1644140	So, you know, Halo 2 is not forgotten for everybody.
1644140	1647540	Let's see, Hitstun in our chat says, if you have an original Xbox and it's not modded,
1647540	1648900	it's time to mod it.
1648900	1651980	And that also makes me think of the fact that, you know, you could also go the way of the
1651980	1656420	original Halo, and if you really want to play your Halo 2 or your Halo, it's time to break
1656420	1657420	out the LAN party.
1657420	1660340	You know, we still do that sometimes.
1660340	1661340	Yeah?
1661340	1664940	Yeah, we would have, like, the TVs all over the house, and the, actually, I'll tell you
1664940	1671860	what's funny, Dan's bachelor party was really a bunch of people over playing, you know,
1671860	1674740	all the systems on LAN, so.
1674740	1678100	GameGuru in chat is correcting me that Halo 2 isn't a game on demand.
1678100	1679740	My bad, I assumed that it was.
1679740	1682680	I guess Halo 1 is, but not Halo 2.
1682680	1683680	My bad.
1683680	1689220	Well, okay, but let me just say to that then, okay, make it a game on demand, and make it
1689220	1690220	so that it works.
1690220	1693500	It seems a little strange to me, but I guess maybe they want people to go PC.
1693500	1694500	I don't know.
1694500	1697780	XLink in our chat room says, EA does it all the time.
1697780	1698780	That's true.
1698780	1702060	EA shuts down servers for old games, and we kind of go, well, they're old, there's new
1702060	1706740	versions of the game out, and sure enough, there is Halo 3 and Halo ODST out at this
1706740	1707740	point.
1707740	1713420	I did like what Sega did when they closed the PSO servers, is that for the people that
1713420	1718500	were running private servers, they actually gave them a way to transfer characters and
1718500	1719500	things.
1719500	1722480	And I would think that if, you know, people are actually still playing that, then there
1722480	1727820	should be some other way to host your own server for it or something, you know, and
1727820	1729460	have that be like an external.
1729460	1733340	For some reason, I don't see Microsoft supporting that out of the companies.
1733340	1737380	Like, I could see why Sega would do that, but I could see why Microsoft would not, if
1737380	1738380	that makes sense.
1738380	1742140	And SHA100Matt in our chat room says, in the end, nothing lasts forever.
1742140	1745380	And I guess that's another point as well, is that, hey, you know, that game, you got
1745380	1747980	a good six or seven year run out of it, right?
1747980	1750500	No, no, wait, I'm saying too much.
1750500	1752540	That's how long Xbox Live has been around.
1752540	1755900	Halo 2 has probably been going, what, about four or five years?
1755900	1756900	About.
1756900	1759500	It came out while we were doing this show.
1759500	1760500	Oh, five is when it came out.
1760500	1763300	I played Halo 1 for the first time, and we were on the air, so it has been around for
1763300	1764300	five years now.
1764300	1765300	Five years.
1765300	1767700	That's a pretty good run.
1767700	1771380	Game Guru in chat says Microsoft will more than likely make Halo 2 an Xbox Live Arcade
1771380	1772380	title if anything.
1772380	1773380	I could see that.
1773380	1774380	I could see that.
1774380	1775380	That'd be kind of cool.
1775380	1776380	That would be kind of cool, actually.
1776380	1777820	That might actually bring me back to Halo 2.
1777820	1778820	I don't know.
1778820	1782420	Especially with some super graphics and so forth, but, oh well.
1782420	1787040	I think, again in chat, you said it good, nothing lasts forever, and some day they're
1787040	1790700	going to shut down the servers for all the games we're playing today.
1790700	1794260	Probably in five years when we've moved on to the Xbox 720s and so forth.
1794260	1797540	I just wanted to tell a quick story real quick before we get into the next story, though,
1797540	1801220	and I think I've told this on the show before, in fact I know I have, but when Dark Soccer
1801220	1805020	brought up the LAN party and the things her husband did, I have to talk about the first
1805020	1807320	time I ever went to Dark Soccer's house.
1807320	1808900	Not this house, but the house she used to live in.
1808900	1809900	The two story apartment?
1809900	1810900	In the ghetto.
1810900	1811900	Or the hood house?
1811900	1812900	In the ghetto.
1812900	1813900	Oh, with the big vaulted ceiling and the bad carpet?
1813900	1814900	Yes.
1814900	1815900	Yeah.
1815900	1817020	And it was the first time I believe I ever met your husband and George and some of the
1817020	1819500	friends that your husband hangs out with.
1819500	1821340	I walked in the house.
1821340	1826660	There's TVs all over the house, like a TV on the kitchen table, a TV in the living room.
1826660	1827660	The nest party.
1827660	1828660	A TV everywhere.
1828660	1834140	And they all had Nintendos hooked up and I was like, what the hell is going on here?
1834140	1838420	And Jamie's like, they're having a LAN party, a local area Nintendo party.
1838420	1842540	All these TVs had Nintendo systems hooked up and they were playing the Legend of Zelda.
1842540	1848080	And I guess they were having a contest to see who could beat the Legend of Zelda first.
1848080	1851560	And some people were like already on the seventh dungeon, like I think your husband was really
1851560	1852560	far ahead.
1852560	1853560	I think Dan actually won that one.
1853560	1854560	I'm sure he did.
1854560	1855900	And some people were still struggling.
1855900	1858940	They were on like dungeon three and some people were in the overworld, so I couldn't really
1858940	1863260	tell where they were at, but I just remember thinking that is the fucking coolest thing
1863260	1864520	I've ever seen.
1864520	1867580	Like I was like, Jamie and I are going to get along just fine because this had to be
1867580	1868900	about a year before we started OLR.
1868900	1873660	I mean, it was, it was a while before OLR, but I was just remember thinking, wow, this
1873660	1876100	is all kinds of awesome.
1876100	1879020	I kind of miss that house except don't miss where it was.
1879020	1880020	Yeah.
1880020	1882860	So anyway, I just wanted to tell that story if you never heard it before here on the show
1882860	1884460	because I always think that's hilarious.
1884460	1890300	And I would, I would love nothing more than to see another LAN party happen somewhere
1890300	1891300	somehow.
1891300	1892300	I think that would be a lot of fun.
1892300	1896220	So if there's ever, if Dan ever decides he's doing another Nintendo party, I want in.
1896220	1901180	I have to bring my FC mobile because keep in mind that we probably got three other NESs
1901180	1902660	and you have, you have an NES.
1902660	1903660	Well that's right.
1903660	1904660	I do have the NES.
1904660	1906500	I do have that, but I don't have a Zelda cart, but we can get one.
1906500	1909620	Like I've got like three of them hanging around somewhere.
1909620	1913900	One of the batteries I think finally died in one of them, but we've also got Zelda two.
1913900	1917580	Those batteries were only guaranteed to last like five years, but most of them have lasted
1917580	1918580	like 20.
1918580	1919580	Yeah.
1919580	1920580	Pretty crazy.
1920580	1921580	All right.
1921580	1922580	Anyhow.
1922580	1923580	Sorry guys.
1923580	1924580	Got a little tangent, but that happens here on this show sometimes.
1924580	1927820	Uh, Loki, bring us back with some more gaming news.
1927820	1928820	Yes.
1928820	1933780	Um, so you know, Facebook's been getting a lot of games recently and a lot of them been
1933780	1938460	pretty basic and they're starting to get some better stuff like new with new civilization
1938460	1944080	game and whatnot, but now they're actually getting a first person shooter game.
1944080	1947380	This game's called Brave Arms and actually looks kind of cool.
1947380	1953300	Kind of like a, I don't know if like the quake online stuff like quake zero or whatever,
1953300	1954700	but um, it's pretty cool.
1954700	1962700	It's from three G studios and um, apparently it's set to come out in March and it's kind
1962700	1969700	of similar to like a doom quake halo call of duty and that's what they should just call
1969700	1972540	the game doom quake halo call of duty.
1972540	1973540	Yeah.
1973540	1974540	Nice.
1974540	1979340	So see, when I first read about this, you know what kind of made me laugh as I imagined
1979340	1983300	because most of the games that you play on Facebook, like the Farmville's and the Yo
1983300	1989020	Ville's and the, I don't know, whatever else, but jewel blitz even, you kind of play against
1989020	1993420	other people and other people's avatars and other people's default user pictures and so
1993420	1994420	forth.
1994420	1998000	Like the image I got in my mind when I first heard this story is that I could actually
1998000	2002460	shoot my friends like their little face pictures on like bodies.
2002460	2003460	Wouldn't that be funny?
2003460	2004460	That would be funny.
2004460	2005460	That would be hilarious.
2005460	2006460	But that's probably not what this is.
2006460	2007460	Is it?
2007460	2008460	No, it's more traditional.
2008460	2009460	Somebody should make that game on Facebook.
2009460	2015060	Patent pending, patent pending, Loki, would you play a game like that for free?
2015060	2016900	I think I, I check it out at least.
2016900	2021620	I played, um, quake, um, I can't remember that quake live.
2021620	2023580	I played that for a little bit when it first came out.
2023580	2026860	I thought it was cool cause it was based off quake three, which was like the best fricking
2026860	2027860	quake they ever did.
2027860	2030140	In fact, somebody in chat agrees with me.
2030140	2031140	Uh, let's see.
2031140	2032140	Who is it?
2032140	2033140	Ah, yes.
2033140	2034140	Zen thralls.
2034140	2035140	Zen says quake three arena.
2035140	2036140	Best land party game ever.
2036140	2037140	Period.
2037140	2039580	I was, it was one of the best, uh, over the internet games too.
2039580	2041100	Oh, it was a lot of fun to play.
2041100	2043500	I had a good time with that one.
2043500	2046700	We'll see how this Facebook game goes, but I'm telling you guys this.
2046700	2048740	This is the direction gaming's moving.
2048740	2052820	Facebook as a platform for, for gaming.
2052820	2057620	Pretty soon you're going to be talking Xbox 360, Wii, PS3, PC, and Facebook gaming.
2057620	2058620	Oh, and iPhones.
2058620	2060060	You got to throw that in there too.
2060060	2064900	Facebook is like a serious platform for gaming.
2064900	2065900	Believe it or not.
2065900	2069900	Uh, one thing to take very seriously as a lot of people do is world of Warcraft and
2069900	2072820	some people take the auction house dealings very seriously.
2072820	2075220	In fact, some people kind of play the economy.
2075220	2077140	It's like the game.
2077140	2080260	Like I don't really, I don't really get into the whole auction house dealings, so I'm not
2080260	2083420	sure exactly what they do, but I guess it's kind of like the stock stock market.
2083420	2088120	You buy items that are plentiful and then when they're not available, you sell them
2088120	2090460	at a high profit is basically what it is.
2090460	2093940	Well, people that play world of Warcraft for the auctions and for the markets are in for
2093940	2096620	a big surprise because guess what?
2096620	2101060	Apparently Blizzard has announced this week that soon you are going to be able to manage
2101060	2108540	your auctions from world of Warcraft using the armory application on the iPhone or iPod
2108540	2110280	touch.
2110280	2112580	We don't know much about exactly how this will work yet.
2112580	2114060	You know, we don't know the specifics.
2114060	2116780	Like can you access your in game mail too?
2116780	2119940	Because that's the only way you get the money from your auctions or you know, how would
2119940	2123260	you post something if you can't access your character's bags or what have you.
2123260	2124960	We don't know the answer to all the specifics yet.
2124960	2128800	We just know that Blizzard is throwing out that idea of you could play the economical
2128800	2131140	game of world of Warcraft on the go.
2131140	2132140	Interesting.
2132140	2136860	But of course, one thing they are saying with this as well is that it will cost money.
2136860	2139660	It's going to be a premium based service.
2139660	2143200	They've said premium based, which you know that means cost money.
2143200	2147500	Don't know if that'll be a monthly thing that you add on for your character or what I would
2147500	2151460	assume would be the option would be you charge for the app on the iPhone.
2151460	2154340	If you're going to be releasing this on the iPhone, you're going to charge $9.99 for the
2154340	2156160	app or something like that.
2156160	2158180	That's how they will make their money.
2158180	2162060	Dark Sakura, I know you're not a big WoW player anymore, but let's say they had an equivalent
2162060	2164860	in Star Trek online, or let's imagine you did still play WoW.
2164860	2167020	Do you think this is the kind of thing you'd be interested in?
2167020	2169120	As long as it's free.
2169120	2170120	But it's not.
2170120	2171620	So you wouldn't pay a premium for it?
2171620	2173620	No, I wouldn't.
2173620	2174620	Why do you think someone would-
2174620	2178720	Then again, this is the person who just bought, you know, a thousand cryptic points.
2178720	2180500	Why do you think someone would be into this?
2180500	2183700	Why do you think someone would say, hey, because I'm looking at this going, you know, as awesome
2183700	2188220	as this feature sounds, and depending on the cost, I might just, like if it is just like
2188220	2191660	five bucks for the app, I might just buy it to check it out.
2191660	2193580	I don't see myself really using it.
2193580	2196180	Like it's kind of weird to be using that on the phone.
2196180	2202300	I was trying to look at the page for, you know, what the interface and everything.
2202300	2203420	Well, they don't have that yet.
2203420	2205660	It's all they've said now is an announcement.
2205660	2210980	I used the armory itself, but I don't know.
2210980	2212860	I'm not that obsessed about the games I play.
2212860	2215580	I mean, really, it's something for addicts.
2215580	2220740	Loki, I know you're not a big MMO player anymore, but let's assume this was five years ago and
2220740	2223100	this is a Final Fantasy XI Auction House app.
2223100	2224100	What do you think?
2224100	2227500	Well, it's an app for an iPhone or something like that, right?
2227500	2230940	Well, yeah, but let's say it was something you could access on the web too or something.
2230940	2231940	I don't know.
2231940	2232940	No.
2232940	2233940	No?
2233940	2234940	Not for you?
2234940	2235940	Not for me.
2235940	2236940	That's why I go into game.
2236940	2237940	Good point.
2237940	2242580	I have to admit, although I might be willing to just kind of check it out if, you know,
2242580	2246740	just for the sake of checking it out, I don't know if I'd want to pay a monthly fee just
2246740	2247740	to manage my auctions.
2247740	2249220	I mean, that's kind of what.
2249220	2254260	And the other thing that kind of worries me, this is like my one little weird worry and
2254260	2257900	I don't know, maybe the chatters can tell me if I'm being irrational with this, but
2257900	2262460	I kind of always thought this was how a lot of the gold farmers made their money.
2262460	2268780	So by kind of allowing folks to do this without being actually in the game, could you possibly
2268780	2272720	be encouraging the gold farming community and the people that are hacking and stealing
2272720	2274080	accounts?
2274080	2278860	Is that an irrational line of thought or do I have a legitimate concern there?
2278860	2280460	I don't know.
2280460	2281460	You tell me.
2281460	2282460	Chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
2282460	2285840	We'll get to some of that feedback in just a moment, but we'll move on with the news
2285840	2287840	for now.
2287840	2295220	Now, you remember when we were talking about Akira Yamaoka leaving Konami?
2295220	2304740	Well, we know where he ended up, is with Grasshopper Manufacture and is supposed to be doing music
2304740	2312220	for an upcoming horror game that they're doing that's produced by Shinji Mikami.
2312220	2320140	So maybe it's going to be going back to more of a game that has the feel of the older Silent
2320140	2326100	Hill, you know, not necessarily the kind of Americanized ones now, you know what I mean?
2326100	2331900	But just if it puts anything in perspective, Grasshopper did Fatal Frame 4 and No More
2331900	2332900	Heroes 2.
2332900	2338220	Do you know that they have the translation project for Fatal Frame 4?
2338220	2339220	Yeah, it's really good.
2339220	2342580	Yeah, I think we covered that a few weeks ago, probably about a month ago on the show.
2342580	2343580	Yeah, I remember that.
2343580	2344580	So I think that's pretty cool.
2344580	2351820	If that's the kind of game he's going to work on, then perhaps it's a worthy thing that
2351820	2353820	he's jumped ship.
2353820	2358700	I don't know where I read this, and it's probably just one of those fan wank rumors, I don't
2358700	2361980	know, but I had heard that EA was courting Akira Yamaoka.
2361980	2365620	Well, EA is producing the game that Grasshopper's working on.
2365620	2366620	I see.
2366620	2370060	Maybe that's, maybe it was kind of jumping to conclusions type of thing.
2370060	2371060	Possibly.
2371060	2372060	That could be.
2372060	2378140	Probably to Akira Yamaoka getting to do whatever Silent Hilly horror game I'm sure EA would
2378140	2379460	be more than happy to publish.
2379460	2381780	Oh, I wouldn't doubt that at all.
2381780	2382780	Yeah.
2382780	2383780	Interesting.
2383780	2387580	I mean, that man is pretty much Silent Hill.
2387580	2392620	Going back to the chat room, chat.orangelandradiocomm and some of the comments from the auction
2392620	2397520	app for WoW, SSJ100 Matt in our chat room says, I bet there will be an auction house
2397520	2399820	app for Final Fantasy XIV.
2399820	2404820	You know, it will be interesting to see how Squeenix kind of embraces all this stuff that
2404820	2405900	WoW is doing.
2405900	2411460	They, they, I noticed for Eleven, especially towards the end, they tried to do some very
2411460	2416680	minor armory-ish stuff, like you could access link shell lists in game and basic character
2416680	2420620	information on the web, but the armory is really robust now, like you can even get like
2420620	2424920	pictures of your characters in the armory, like as they appear in game, like it renders
2424920	2425920	them.
2425920	2426920	Oh yeah, I thought it was cool.
2426920	2429100	And you can pose them in different poses, so when other people look at it, they'll see
2429100	2430100	it, which I think is kind of cool.
2430100	2431740	Like I have one of my characters blowing a kiss.
2431740	2432740	It's really cheesy.
2432740	2437860	Let's see, other comments from chat room, xlink says, I'm not buying it.
2437860	2441680	And it also says that he thought of the same thing that I was mentioning with the gold
2441680	2446140	farmers and that's why he's not using it.
2446140	2450860	Also was a quick shout out there from hitstun, does Dissida have any Final Fantasy XI characters?
2450860	2455580	SSJ100 Matt clarifying, yes, there's a quick cameo of a Final Fantasy XI character.
2455580	2461820	Final Fantasy XI is tricky to do because there was no standard hero.
2461820	2465820	You were the hero and you could look a variety of different ways, you know, because you could
2465820	2467060	customize your character.
2467060	2470180	Although everyone had the same outfit over and over and over and over.
2470180	2471180	For real.
2471180	2472180	I mean the customization was very limited.
2472180	2475900	I did like, so seeing the male characters walking around in their leather mantis.
2475900	2478820	Yes, yes, there was always the, what were they called?
2478820	2484220	The bronze, or whatever, yeah, it looked like mantis, basically, who was running around
2484220	2485700	and it was really funny.
2485700	2488380	With a harness.
2488380	2489380	Yes.
2489380	2495100	Let's, let's, but some of like maybe the boss characters and some of the NPCs that you interact
2495100	2496100	with I could see being in the game.
2496100	2497100	I think that's what they were talking about.
2497100	2498100	I'm sure it is too.
2498100	2501500	As SSJ100 Matt clarifies, it's a Taru Taru, which...
2501500	2502980	It's one of the characters that's in the game.
2502980	2506200	Doesn't surprise me at all because Taru Taru is what everybody remembers.
2506200	2509820	And even in Final Fantasy XIV, they're going to have Taru Tarus, but they're not calling
2509820	2513580	them Taru Tarus, which is so weird to me, but...
2513580	2514580	It is absolutely retarded.
2514580	2518540	Whatever, hey, hey, whatever, as long as the game is good, I don't care.
2518540	2521500	Call them Sexy Chocolate for all I care.
2521500	2522500	Sexy Chocolate?
2522500	2523500	That's awesome.
2523500	2530220	I'm going to roll a Sexy Chocolate White Mage.
2530220	2531300	Where did I even get that?
2531300	2532300	I don't know.
2532300	2533300	Alright.
2533300	2534300	I have no idea.
2534300	2535300	You know what's funny?
2535300	2536860	You made me think about wrestling for the first time in a long time.
2536860	2538980	By talking about Sexy Chocolate White Mage?
2538980	2547260	There was a guy on there whose character's nickname was Sexual Chocolate.
2547260	2551660	That should be the name of a video game band.
2551660	2552660	Sexy Chocolate White Mage.
2552660	2556860	I don't know how that works, but...
2556860	2559300	Oh god, we need to do some release dates.
2559300	2560300	Goober!
2560300	2561300	Quick, please change the topic.
2561300	2562300	Help.
2562300	2563300	Okay.
2563300	2567080	Well, this isn't anything to do with Sexy Chocolate, but I guess since next week is
2567080	2573060	Valentine's week, and I guess it could be Sexy Chocolate, if you're into that kind of
2573060	2580060	thing for Dante's Inferno, because nothing says Sexy Chocolate like tortured souls and
2580060	2588120	hell, of course that'll be out on Playstation 3 as the Divine Edition, because it's divinely
2588120	2595020	packed with extras, and the regular edition on Xbox 360.
2595020	2601500	And then of course, also that week there will be Star Ocean Last Hope International Edition,
2601500	2606220	which is on Playstation 3, basically the port of the game that came out on Xbox 360 last
2606220	2607220	year.
2607220	2613980	Family Party 30 Great Games Winter Fun, yet another party game compilation for the Wii.
2613980	2618260	World Cup of Pool coming to the DS.
2618260	2622180	Sheeran the Wanderer coming to the Wii, which looks pretty awesome.
2622180	2623660	That's from Atlus.
2623660	2630900	And of course, the big one for the week, BioShock 2, making its way out on PC, Playstation 3,
2630900	2632860	and Xbox 360.
2632860	2638260	Or if you're a teenage girl, perhaps Seen at Twilight is the big game for you this week.
2638260	2640540	That will be out on the DS.
2640540	2647700	And if you want none of those, or just own a Wii, then perhaps Super Monkey Ball Step
2647700	2649580	and Roll will be your type of game.
2649580	2652020	And that's coming out just on the Wii.
2652020	2655260	Low-key, you know how much it would amuse me, especially for the YouTube channel, if
2655260	2659500	we were to follow you with a camera, to one of those midnight releases for Dante's Inferno
2659500	2662120	or BioShock 2, because they're both coming out at the same time, right?
2662120	2665420	And then you walk up to the counter and ask for Seen at Twilight.
2665420	2666420	I would love that.
2666420	2669100	Except I wouldn't want to do that.
2669100	2672800	By the way, the reason why that's called the Divine Edition is because the Inferno was
2672800	2680060	part of the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri, so that's why it's called the Divine Version.
2680060	2685020	Which, I've read that in fifth grade.
2685020	2689660	I thought it was called the Divine Edition because it's like, you know, Sony's way of
2689660	2691940	saying, hey look, we have something exclusive!
2691940	2692940	Ah!
2692940	2699940	We may have lost Final Fantasy 13, and, you know, Residence of Fate, and all the other
2699940	2702620	games have come out, but hey, we've still got the Divine Edition!
2702620	2705660	You're not going to be able to get that download content until later.
2705660	2708540	They're just trying to be all literary and cultured and shit.
2708540	2712340	I thought they called it the Divine Edition because the Sexy Chocolate Edition just got
2712340	2715500	rejected, is what it was.
2715500	2716500	Fail.
2716500	2717500	Alright.
2717500	2718500	Hey!
2718500	2720500	Some other release dates for Japan.
2720500	2722540	Game coming out on the Xbox 360 this week.
2722540	2727740	Sacred 2 Fallen Angel makes its way to Japan this week, and I'm trying to see what kind
2727740	2728880	of game this is.
2728880	2729880	This is a...
2729880	2730880	It's a role-playing game.
2730880	2733780	Well, okay, I can see that, but I'm trying to figure out what more about this.
2733780	2736820	Is this like a Final Fantasy-ish kind of game?
2736820	2739540	The graphics look interesting, kind of like in a desert.
2739540	2740940	It came out here last year.
2740940	2741940	It sucked.
2741940	2742940	Alright.
2742940	2745940	Oh, there's like a not-chocobo in the game there that you can ride.
2745940	2747500	They don't localize this for the US, though, right?
2747500	2748500	It's a boca-cho!
2748500	2749500	Yeah!
2749500	2753320	One of the reviews, though, I'm reading online, this game is massive.
2753320	2755540	There's tons of quests, and the level cap is 200.
2755540	2756540	Who knows, though?
2756540	2758340	That was probably written by the publisher.
2758340	2762180	If you don't want to play that on the Xbox 360, you could check it out on PlayStation
2762180	2766140	3, because it's coming out there, too, as well as a game called Winter Sports 2010 The
2766140	2767700	Great Tournament.
2767700	2772260	I'm assuming that's like coming from a company who didn't get the Olympic license, but wants
2772260	2774180	to cash in on it anyway.
2774180	2776320	So there you go.
2776320	2781020	If you want, you could check out on the Nintendo Wii, Madworld makes its way for Japan this
2781020	2782020	week.
2782020	2786520	That is a Japanese localized release on the Nintendo Wii this week, coming from Sega.
2786520	2790260	And unfortunately, a lot of folks passed here, but maybe if it does very well in Japan, there'll
2790260	2791260	still be a sequel.
2791260	2792900	So you might want to consider picking that up.
2792900	2800420	On the Nintendo DS this week, Mina no Conveni comes out this week, and it is a strategy-based
2800420	2805280	game, but when I say that, it looks like a little girl going cooking.
2805280	2811460	It's not cooking mama, but kind of like cafeteria managing, maybe kind of a version of Diner
2811460	2812460	Dash, I don't know.
2812460	2815440	Kind of what it strikes me as from the pictures I see there.
2815440	2821060	Quickly taking a look at the PSP, Shin Sangoku Musou Multirade gets a price reduction.
2821060	2824460	That game is already out, but it's getting a little price cut this week.
2824460	2826740	It's Dynasty Warriors Strike Force.
2826740	2829100	That's what you might know the game better as.
2829100	2831740	Those are your Japanese release dates.
2831740	2834580	Dark Sakura, what's going on overseas in the UK the other way?
2834580	2837700	Well for the UK, we've got a few goodies.
2837700	2842060	We have Bioshock 2 on the 9th, and on the 10th, Darwinia.
2842060	2846780	And the 12th is Bleach the Third Phantom, Half Minute Hero, Phantasy Star Zero, Star
2846780	2851740	Ocean, The Last Hope, and Super Monkey Ball Step and Roll.
2851740	2856800	Alrighty, cool.
2856800	2858860	So this is kind of interesting.
2858860	2865500	Apparently there is a developer resume that's hinting at an Xbox 360 version of Final Fantasy
2865500	2867140	14.
2867140	2877940	And apparently also this was being removed a few hours later, and apparently this profile
2877940	2885900	that was on a website linked in for designer Yuki Akama referenced work on Final Fantasy
2885900	2889460	14 for PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.
2889460	2896140	Of course, only the PC and PS3 platforms have been officially confirmed to be coming out.
2896140	2900140	And not only that, but Sony took great pride in last year's E3 at saying, you can only
2900140	2902840	play this on the PlayStation 3.
2902840	2906940	And leading many folks to question if the Xbox Live hurdle proved to be too much for
2906940	2910740	Squeenix to deal with, although I'm sure Microsoft doesn't want to lose that.
2910740	2916500	I'm sure we'll hear whether it's coming out on the 360 or not.
2916500	2917940	Earlier this week I thought it was.
2917940	2920820	Now you ever use the website linked in, Matt?
2920820	2921820	No.
2921820	2925740	It's kind of like a professional Facebook, I think is the best way I can describe it.
2925740	2929960	I have a profile on there, and basically it's kind of like a place where you can post your
2929960	2935260	resume and do job searches, but it's supposed to be a way to professionally connect with
2935260	2939300	your coworkers and people they know and so forth.
2939300	2942620	It's more of like a professional linked in, and there are quite a few of the gaming community
2942620	2943620	uses that.
2943620	2947740	I've connected with quite a few other podcast hosts and so forth on linked in.
2947740	2951380	I'm sure it will come out on 360, it only makes sense.
2951380	2955900	More people that they can get on the service, the better it is for them, so I don't see
2955900	2957100	why they wouldn't.
2957100	2962060	It just seems weird to me that Sony was so excited about it, and then just to lose this
2962060	2967460	again, you know, because this would be twice in a row with the whole Final Fantasy 13 thing
2967460	2968460	going to Xbox.
2968460	2972340	That's going to be a blow to the ego.
2972340	2973340	We'll see.
2973340	2980100	Like I said, earlier this week there were reasons for me to believe that there might
2980100	2989340	be a 360 version, but then those were soonly changed just by what I think, I don't know,
2989340	2993260	my own opinion, if I could be vaguer than that.
2993260	2998380	I think a version on the 360 could be eventually, but it would seem like that might come out
2998380	2999380	later.
2999380	3004720	And here's the other thing, Squeenix doesn't seem to think that Final Fantasy will do well
3004720	3005980	on 360 in Japan.
3005980	3010580	Keep in mind, Final Fantasy 13, not happening on the 360 in Japan, or hasn't happened yet
3010580	3013060	because the game's already out there.
3013060	3016820	Maybe the same type of thing is happening where they're going to release Final Fantasy
3016820	3023700	14 on the 360 here in America and only here in maybe Europe too.
3023700	3029820	But maybe they don't want to hold up the debut of the game to make the 360 version.
3029820	3030820	Does that make sense?
3030820	3032980	Because they're going to do a worldwide launch this time.
3032980	3037020	You know, 11 took like a year to get localized over here, but maybe Final Fantasy 14, they're
3037020	3039020	going to throw it out there all at once.
3039020	3041060	Japan, US, and Europe.
3041060	3043740	Everybody gets it at once, and there'll be a 360 version someday.
3043740	3047620	Would it be hilarious if it became a 360 exclusive?
3047620	3048620	No way.
3048620	3049620	No way.
3049620	3050740	It would be hilarious though.
3050740	3057520	Just considering how, you know, Final Fantasy 11 was really created as a PS2 game.
3057520	3059140	It was really made for the PlayStation 2.
3059140	3064580	I know a lot of us here in the States played it on the PC, but part of the reason that
3064580	3070340	game was so limited and finally outgrew itself and couldn't expand the way that WoW has continued
3070340	3073840	to expand is because it's limited to the PS2.
3073840	3079060	And that's why Final Fantasy 11 is kind of, they're not going to really support that as
3079060	3080060	much anymore.
3080060	3081060	I'm sure it will always be alive.
3081060	3084820	There will always be people playing Final Fantasy 11, but it's going to downsize big
3084820	3088900	time when 14 comes out.
3088900	3090140	And we'll see what happens.
3090140	3091540	All right.
3091540	3094940	One other story for you guys here, and then we're going to get to the classic game of
3094940	3095940	the week.
3095940	3098900	And this has to do with some rumors, and this is a big fat rumor.
3098900	3103060	And this is also one of the rumors, I don't know, it seems kind of useless to talk about
3103060	3106260	this on the show, but I thought I'd throw it out there because it is circulating around
3106260	3107260	some blogs.
3107260	3113480	But apparently there is a rumor going around that a quote, new Nintendo platform is going
3113480	3116940	to be announced at the game developers conference.
3116940	3123040	And that's in a story that was run by the website video gamer.com from an industry source,
3123040	3128140	an employee at a major international publisher, obviously anonymous, as you can imagine, quote,
3128140	3132860	just heard a rumor that you may be interested in Nintendo are going to announce a new platform
3132860	3134320	at GDC.
3134320	3137420	Some devs have already started work on it.
3137420	3141060	So we don't know if that could be a redone handheld.
3141060	3146700	I mean, I think we've already heard rumblings of a DS2, even though there's the Excel
3146700	3150780	still has yet to come out here in the US, we've heard rumblings of a DS2.
3150780	3154940	Some fanboys are hoping it's finally the Wii HD already.
3154940	3155940	Who knows what it could be?
3155940	3158540	Could it maybe be an enhancement to the existing Wii?
3158540	3163580	Like I don't want to joke the vitality sensor, but something in that vein?
3163580	3164620	Probably nothing like that.
3164620	3166340	I don't know if they would do another Wii.
3166340	3169460	I mean, because it's selling like hotcakes right now.
3169460	3174260	What would be the point, you know, in trying to put some now I'd see maybe another handheld
3174260	3178700	system because maybe that's starting to slow down a little bit, but I doubt they would
3178700	3179700	be doing a Wii.
3179700	3186540	They're going to build one that you implant into your brain so you can just play until
3186540	3187740	you have seizures.
3187740	3191420	Unless they're trying to stay ahead, they're worried that maybe once these other motion
3191420	3198660	controllers come out for Microsoft and PlayStation 3 and Sony, that you're going to have kind
3198660	3203620	of an even playing field and then they're going to just fail based on the quality of
3203620	3207300	their product because now you're going to have these really pretty looking games that
3207300	3212220	control just like they do on the Wii and people are going to be more apt to maybe buying those,
3212220	3217820	which I don't think that's true, but maybe they're just trying to stay one step ahead.
3217820	3224120	So I don't know, either way, I'm not too excited about it.
3224120	3228660	In our chatroom at chat.orangelandraday.com, MaginamiCon, I hope I said that right, says
3228660	3229660	what?
3229660	3230780	A phone?
3230780	3231780	The end phone?
3231780	3233500	Could that happen?
3233500	3239100	I somehow doubt that, but that would be an interesting idea, sure.
3239100	3242860	Interesting too, I kind of want to say if this is true, I don't think it's true.
3242860	3246900	I think some things might happen behind closed doors at Game Developers Conference, but I
3246900	3249860	don't think you're going to see the major announcement until E3.
3249860	3252260	Game Developers Conference is not a media show.
3252260	3255860	It doesn't strike me as the place to announce a new platform.
3255860	3260980	The place to announce maybe a revision, I could see like a DSi XL or something there
3260980	3263860	even though it's already out in Japan, but you know what I mean, like a slightly altered
3263860	3264860	version.
3264860	3267620	An enhancement or a new tool.
3267620	3272020	Like I could see more Natal information coming out of GDC and some of the things that enhance
3272020	3277380	gaming, but I don't see a full-on new platform being announced at Game Developers Conference.
3277380	3278660	It's not a media show.
3278660	3280660	It's for game developers.
3280660	3281660	It's in the title.
3281660	3285880	I know people think it's a media show and it's turning into one, but it's not supposed
3285880	3286880	to be.
3286880	3289260	It's really, really not, and I think a lot of people resent that it is.
3289260	3293260	So I think if Nintendo is going to make an announcement, which I think it is the DS,
3293260	3299100	I think the DS is going to get the revamp, you're going to see it at E3, not a Game Developers
3299100	3300100	Conference.
3300100	3303020	And yes, I know it is weird that I'm talking the DS revamp when we don't even have the
3303020	3308540	XL here in the west, but I think Nintendo kind of knows that they could still put out
3308540	3312060	the XL in limited quantities and it would sell if it was cheaper.
3312060	3317900	It would still sell to the seven and eight year olds and the mothers that like to play
3317900	3322860	Pokemon and whatever, the soccer moms, and whatever new DS system that will be $50 more
3322860	3328340	expensive, maybe even $100 more expensive, will cater to the hardcore gamer who wants
3328340	3330700	their Mario and Zelda games ASAP.
3330700	3331700	Right?
3331700	3332700	I don't know.
3332700	3333700	Does that seem far-fetched to you guys?
3333700	3334700	No.
3334700	3335700	No.
3335700	3336700	All right.
3336700	3337700	Let's see.
3337700	3338700	I'm sorry.
3338700	3342220	I can't be too contrary about that.
3342220	3345580	And some other comments in chat here, talking about MotionPlus, there's a couple of people
3345580	3347580	bringing up MotionPlus.
3347580	3348580	Was MotionPlus a flop?
3348580	3349580	I don't know.
3349580	3350840	That's a good question.
3350840	3352020	Was MotionPlus a flop?
3352020	3354640	What do you think, Loki, from your perspective in sales?
3354640	3359340	Just that people, as far as rental stores and stuff go, they don't want to bring in
3359340	3362420	games that have MotionPlus because they're afraid that people don't have it.
3362420	3364300	It's kind of like the whole Guitar Hero thing.
3364300	3369020	People don't want to bring it in because they're afraid that, oh, it requires this.
3369020	3371520	It's not something that most people have.
3371520	3372520	Is it a flop?
3372520	3376580	I don't know if people are really all excited that, oh God, this game has MotionPlus now.
3376580	3377580	It's going to be better.
3377580	3379740	I don't really think it means anything yet.
3379740	3385620	I mean, there's only been a few games that have actually used it, and I'm sure they're
3385620	3386620	pretty good.
3386620	3391540	It's just, it's not like game-changing or anything.
3391540	3393960	Interesting comment from Blue Swim in our chat room.
3393960	3395460	Interesting creative idea.
3395460	3399460	Black Wii with groundbreaking DVD support.
3399460	3400460	I don't know.
3400460	3401460	I don't think anyone's going to care.
3401460	3405740	I mean, most people are moving on to Blu-ray and stuff, and everything's a DVD player
3405740	3406740	nowadays.
3406740	3410700	Yeah, I think that's a creative outside-the-box answer for the topic at hand, but I just lean
3410700	3411700	towards no.
3411700	3412700	And I mean, seriously.
3412700	3413700	I think Loki's right.
3413700	3414700	Everything's a DVD player.
3414700	3415700	DVD players are like 40 bucks, probably less than that.
3415700	3416700	Wii's going to have Netflix.
3416700	3417700	Yeah.
3417700	3420060	It doesn't need a DVD player.
3420060	3426540	It's a creative answer, but maybe a Wii revision was something else, but again, it's going
3426540	3427800	to go the way of MotionPlus.
3427800	3431560	The biggest problem with MotionPlus, it wasn't included with the console to begin with, so
3431560	3433620	people are afraid not everyone has it.
3433620	3436780	It's very hard to launch a peripheral.
3436780	3439420	That's what Natal's uphill battle's going to be.
3439420	3444660	That's why you read these articles and these rumors about the 360 is going to relaunch.
3444660	3449380	It's not a new console per se, but they have to treat Natal like a relaunch of the damn
3449380	3450380	system.
3450380	3454140	There's ways they can really push the envelope with the Wii and make it very interesting,
3454140	3458440	like using the whole head tracking and stuff like that, but they're just not doing it.
3458440	3459700	They're not thinking outside the box.
3459700	3465580	They don't need these extra add-ons like the Wii Vitality sensor, which is absolute shit.
3465580	3466580	It's just going to be horrible.
3466580	3467900	No one's going to buy it.
3467900	3470900	It's just like the stupid pedometers for the DS.
3470900	3475140	Yeah, there's going to be a few people like, oh good, I can exercise now.
3475140	3479460	Yes, because you couldn't before.
3479460	3483180	I don't understand why they need the add-on.
3483180	3486700	The only thing I can think of is better graphics, maybe soup up the actual processor inside
3486700	3487700	there.
3487700	3493660	You know, because if they're hitting the limits of what they can do on that system, maybe
3493660	3494660	that would help.
3494660	3500980	But you know, like say the DSi for the Wii or something like that.
3500980	3505780	But I'm afraid that whatever they do decide to put out is just going to be very gimmicky
3505780	3511420	and stupid and it just gives them an excuse to put out another Mario game, another Metroid
3511420	3513420	game, another Zelda game.
3513420	3515860	And look, oh look, it's new, but it's not.
3515860	3516860	I don't know.
3516860	3517860	All right.
3517860	3520540	Well, we're going to get into the classic game of the week here in just a moment and
3520540	3524080	wrap up part A of our show, but I do want to say hello to all the folks who are tuning
3524080	3525080	in live tonight.
3525080	3529180	I guess the Super Bowl is over and so now we have some folks kind of coming back to
3529180	3530620	us now that the football game is over.
3530620	3531620	So welcome guys.
3531620	3532620	Glad you could tune in tonight.
3532620	3535500	I'm just going to recap quickly the things we have talked about tonight.
3535500	3539560	Sorry to the podcast listeners, the folks that listen to us, it's the top of the show,
3539560	3541380	but I want everyone to know what we've already covered.
3541380	3546820	Sonic the Four episode one was already announced this week, was Project Needlemouse's other
3546820	3547820	game.
3547820	3549340	Blaster Master Overdrive has surprised us.
3549340	3551460	It's going to be out on Monday.
3551460	3555700	Xbox and Microsoft is ditching live support for the original Xbox.
3555700	3559380	So Halo 2 fans are pissed, but the rest of us will gain a friends list of more than a
3559380	3560940	hundred friends.
3560940	3564580	Facebook is getting a new first person shooter game called Brave Arms.
3564580	3566700	Facebook is a gaming platform, you betcha.
3566700	3572100	Blizzard has been announcing teasing the idea of a premium auction house application for
3572100	3575060	World of Warcraft so you can manage your auctions offline.
3575060	3578540	Akira Yomoka has found a new home, he left Konami a couple months ago and now he's at
3578540	3581900	Grasshopper working with the folks that did No More Heroes.
3581900	3587540	We covered release dates, Final Fantasy XIV, a developer's LinkedIn profile has clued us
3587540	3592420	into the fact that it could be under development for the 360, but we seem to come to a consensus
3592420	3596580	that if it is under development for the 360, it probably won't come out at the same time.
3596580	3600600	And then we just wrapped up talking about a story where Nintendo, big, big rumor could
3600600	3606180	be unveiling a new platform at GDC, but we all seem to think that that is not true.
3606180	3612540	That it's probably some type of just kind of enhancement or new peripheral or some other,
3612540	3617140	you know, slight little addition because Game Developers Conference is not a media show.
3617140	3618140	It's just not.
3618140	3619140	All right.
3619140	3621820	Now we're going to get into the classic video game of the week.
3621820	3625780	It's a chance for us to take a trip down memory lane and go down gaming's history, and Dark
3625780	3630140	Sakura jumps into the vault and says, hey, ew, it's sticky.
3630140	3634420	And here's a video game that you all should be playing.
3634420	3638540	Dark Sakura, what is the classic video game of the week this week?
3638540	3642060	I was going to do this the other week and I decided that I was going to do it this week.
3642060	3643060	It's Qbert.
3643060	3644060	Yeah.
3644060	3649300	Qbert, where you play the little big nosed orange dude that has the, you know, curses
3649300	3653820	like a sailor and gets jumped on by snakes and little green snot looking things.
3653820	3660340	Let's take a listen to Qbert and the awesome 1982 arcade noises.
3660340	3673420	And he even got bonuses for the two discs on the side.
3673420	3674420	Yep.
3674420	3676660	I love the little sound that the disc makes.
3676660	3679100	Yeah, that's some cussing.
3679100	3684380	Anyway, so Qbert was originally supposed to be a game about Qbert's big nose that could
3684380	3685380	shoot projectiles.
3685380	3689860	And he would hop all over a pyramid that was actually made by Warren Davis.
3689860	3694820	Instead, the shooting was taken out and he jumps and changes the colors on little platforms
3694820	3696020	on a pyramid.
3696020	3700180	The original project name was called Cubes and was sort of called Snots and Boogers for
3700180	3701180	a while.
3701180	3705940	And then the little cussing thing that Qbert says when he gets hit.
3705940	3708340	I love the high score board, by the way.
3708340	3709340	Hi there!
3709340	3710700	In big letters.
3710700	3711700	Hi there!
3711700	3714180	Welcome to the Nozer Elite!
3714180	3717980	Well, hello!
3717980	3723540	So yeah, it is basically sort of puzzle and hopping around and, you know, the game actually
3723540	3728420	gets really hard because, you know, your first few levels you only change it once and you've
3728420	3731540	got enemies all over the board.
3731540	3735780	Also, then you move on to it changing to two colors.
3735780	3737700	You have to change the entire board.
3737700	3741980	And then it happens that you change to one color and if you hop back on it, it changes
3741980	3742980	back.
3742980	3745020	And so you have to get them all to match the final new color.
3745020	3747820	And there's ones that change three times if you hop on them.
3747820	3752380	And that's where the game just gets, like, disgustingly annoying.
3752380	3753860	I was really good at this.
3753860	3759840	I had the, actually, I had the Coleco version, Coleco Vision version for a long time, which
3759840	3760840	I still have.
3760840	3762700	I had the Commodore 64 version.
3762700	3769580	Um, but your little enemies are called Coily, who's the purple snake, and Ugg and Wrongway,
3769580	3775580	these little purple snotty little creatures, and Slick and Sam that are the green boogers.
3775580	3782420	And you can, you know, ride the little discs up to the top of the pyramid.
3782420	3787540	And if you jump on the pyramid right, on the disc right when one of the enemies are chasing
3787540	3792620	you, or I should say Coily is chasing you, they'll hop off the edge behind you and die.
3792620	3794940	Isn't that great, Rob?
3794940	3795940	Yes.
3795940	3797580	That used to be how you'd have to do it.
3797580	3802460	You'd have to kind of, like, lure them towards the disc and then kind of jump up there.
3802460	3805380	It's kind of like what you were talking about last week during the Classic Game of the Week,
3805380	3807580	which was Link to the Past.
3807580	3810940	How you'd have in those dungeons, the guards would charge at you, and if you were standing
3810940	3814260	towards the edge, then you'd just run real fast and they'd charge right off the edge
3814260	3815260	into oblivion.
3815260	3816260	It was great.
3816260	3821980	Well, um, the other thing about this too, though, is that it was, um, produced by Gottlieb,
3821980	3828380	who does a lot of, who did, I should say, a lot of, uh, pinball tables too.
3828380	3838660	Um, it also, um, the guy who developed it, uh, Warren Davis, sorry, um, was, uh, the
3838660	3845940	guy who was behind, um, Revolution X and Terminator 2 and a lot of fun, Joust 2 and Us vs. Them,
3845940	3847820	which is a laserdisc game.
3847820	3853380	So he's been in, he was also on an episode of House MD, I didn't know that.
3853380	3858500	Anyway, he's, you know, been around, you know, in the industry for a while and brought out
3858500	3860220	some pretty big classics.
3860220	3866740	And then, um, it really is just a very simple little game, but it gets really hard.
3866740	3872420	Um, as far as, uh, there were other games that came out.
3872420	3878340	Um, for Qbert itself, it came out on the Odyssey 2, which I have that system as well.
3878340	3887180	The Texas Instruments TI99, the, uh, Commodore VIC-20, um, Atari, the Atari systems, um,
3887180	3889860	the Atari 5200 version is ass, by the way.
3889860	3891860	Qbert was on everything from the 80s.
3891860	3892860	Yeah.
3892860	3893860	Everything.
3893860	3894860	Pretty much.
3894860	3901020	Um, there was also, um, a sequel, an actual sequel called Qbert's Cubes, which, um...
3901020	3902020	Is not bad.
3902020	3903020	I played it.
3903020	3904020	It's kind of fun.
3904020	3905020	Yeah, it's kind of fun.
3905020	3908500	Um, then there was Qbert III that came out on the NES, but it was very much like the
3908500	3909500	first one.
3909500	3914340	And there was a Qbert pinball, of course, got, like, put out called Qbert's Quest.
3914340	3922820	And, um, there was a tabletop electronic game version, um, all kinds of stuff.
3922820	3932060	There's also, um, a version that, uh, was put out by Davis that, um, was called Faster,
3932060	3937300	Harder, More Challenging Qbert, and it's actually now out, um, while he didn't put it into production,
3937300	3938300	is out for MAME.
3938300	3939940	He released the, uh, ROM image.
3939940	3940940	Oh, wow.
3940940	3941940	Cool.
3941940	3946940	And, of course, there's, um, the, uh, updated Qbert that, um, uh, was on, um...
3946940	3954340	Crap, now I can't remember which of the, um, but it was, uh, um, a 3D Qbert, like a Qbert
3954340	3955340	remix or something.
3955340	3957900	I think there was one on PlayStation, I want to say.
3957900	3958900	I could be wrong.
3958900	3964300	Yeah, there was, uh, the one on PS3, there was the 3D version of it, and it was supposed
3964300	3965300	to be pretty good.
3965300	3966300	Hmm.
3966300	3971020	You know, I liked Qbert and all, and I, I, I would like to see this come out on the Game
3971020	3975580	Room that Microsoft is doing, but I don't know if, if it will, because who owns the
3975580	3977660	rights to the Gottlieb games now?
3977660	3980620	Like, don't, doesn't a board game company own that, like, it doesn't, like, Hasbro
3980620	3981620	own them or something?
3981620	3982980	Is something really weird?
3982980	3985140	I don't know, but I'm wondering where this...
3985140	3991660	Like, I would think, though, free money, you know, like, hello, why don't you, uh, put
3991660	3995020	this game out on Game Room, but I don't know, it's gonna be weird.
3995020	3999440	But I do hope if it does come out on Game Room, that you can control it with the buttons,
3999440	4001300	because you know with the D-pad it's gonna stink.
4001300	4007100	In fact, on the Commodore 64 version, there was a mode where you could tilt your joystick
4007100	4012740	45 degrees, so that way you used up, down, left, and right to control.
4012740	4017540	And then up went, like, actually to the upright, and you know, it, it, it, it made it a lot
4017540	4022180	easier to control on the Commodore 64, trust me, because trying to hit diag-diagonal directions,
4022180	4025740	can you imagine trying to hit diagonal directions on the Xbox 360 D-pad?
4025740	4027340	No thank you.
4027340	4030540	Hopefully if it does come out in Game Room, you can use buttons for precision.
4030540	4031540	Hopefully.
4031540	4032540	We'll see.
4032540	4033540	But yeah.
4033540	4034540	Oh, you know what else I remember, Rob?
4034540	4035540	What's that?
4035540	4037540	The Qbert cartoon, when I was a kid.
4037540	4038540	Mm-hmm.
4038540	4039540	I had the Qbert board game.
4039540	4040540	There was a board game.
4040540	4041540	Yep.
4041540	4045940	I actually, somewhere, I had, I may not still have it, but I had a Qbert plushie.
4045940	4046940	Very cute.
4046940	4047940	With his big nose.
4047940	4052060	All right, well that's gonna bring us to a close of part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but
4052060	4053060	we are not done yet.
4053060	4055140	We still have part B coming up after the break.
4055140	4059500	We're gonna talk about a new console from Sega, but it's not what you think.
4059500	4064300	We're gonna talk about a sequel to the Fallout series and some interesting developments over
4064300	4065300	at Harmonix.
4065300	4068580	That's all coming up in part B. So those of you listening live, stay tuned.
4068580	4071380	We'll be back in a few minutes with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4071380	4073260	Podcast listeners, you only have to wait a few seconds.
4073260	4082980	So we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4082980	4088020	Welcome back, everybody, to more of Orange Lounge Radio on this part B of our podcast
4088020	4094220	episode number 354 for this February the 7th of 2010.
4094220	4099140	It is Super Bowl Sunday here in the States, and I'm kind of, I don't really watch the
4099140	4100140	game.
4100140	4101140	I'm not really into football.
4101140	4102140	The Super Bowl.
4102140	4104660	But I know a lot of people watch it, so I know it was keeping people away from the show.
4104660	4106660	But now that it's over, you have no excuse.
4106660	4111020	So hopefully, if you're listening live, you are here in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
4111020	4115260	And of course, if you're listening to us on the podcast feed, you should try and make
4115260	4116980	it for a live show sometime.
4116980	4118580	We will be here next Sunday.
4118580	4123120	Next Sunday is Valentine's Day, which is also probably going to keep several people away.
4123120	4126840	But the three of us have arranged plans with our significant others, so we will still be
4126840	4129260	able to be here for the Valentine's Day show.
4129260	4131180	So look forward to that.
4131180	4133940	Anyhow, or as some folks like to call it, Singles Awareness Day.
4133940	4136500	So if you're single, come join the OLR family.
4136500	4138660	We'll make you feel right at home here and talk about games or something.
4138660	4142300	Keep your mind off of what Hallmark wants you to think about all day long.
4142300	4143300	All right.
4143300	4145900	Anyhow, let's get back into some gaming news, huh?
4145900	4146900	Yes.
4146900	4147900	All right.
4147900	4149620	Let's do some quick, quick news stories.
4149620	4150620	Loki.
4150620	4151620	Yes.
4151620	4152620	This is kind of cool.
4152620	4157660	Now, there will be a Heavy Rain demo coming out on PlayStation 3 soon.
4157660	4159860	It's not scheduled to come out until February 11th.
4159860	4163680	But if you can't wait that long, you can actually download it now.
4163680	4167700	And the way you do this is participate in their alternate reality game.
4167700	4170260	Now I know you probably don't have the time to do all that stuff.
4170260	4174640	Thankfully if you go to Kotaku.com, they actually have a guide to walk you through picking up
4174640	4181340	the four pieces of evidence that you need to pick out in order to receive this demo.
4181340	4185980	So the clue and everything is all right there for you.
4185980	4192480	Basically it just involves you signing up on Sony's site, heavyrainps3.com, and just
4192480	4193600	register there.
4193600	4200900	And then go to the website precinct52.com.
4200900	4207060	And then you can just look for the four pieces of evidence, which are the short cigarette
4207060	4217220	marked 11117B, the Origami Bird, Coffee Shop C, which you'll actually click on the one
4217220	4223760	that says Diner on it, and then the tire tracks, it's 117H.
4223760	4225780	When you click on the tire tracks, it actually expands it out.
4225780	4226780	Same with the cigarettes.
4226780	4230700	You click on the picture of the cigarette and it'll be two different choices and choose
4230700	4231700	117B.
4231700	4236820	Once you've done all that, you'll receive a code to download the demo immediately, which
4236820	4241140	is better than waiting till the 11th.
4241140	4242140	Other fun stuff.
4242140	4246700	Coming to the PlayStation Network, Fret Nice, which was a game, it's kind of a side scroll
4246700	4252340	platformer game, that was actually a Flash game at one time that you played entirely
4252340	4255720	with the Guitar Hero Rock Band controller.
4255720	4261140	Although for whatever reason, they decided to go with this really freakishly weird art
4261140	4262140	style.
4262140	4264220	Personally, I like the Flash version better.
4264220	4269140	But whatever, it will be available on PlayStation Network soon.
4269140	4275780	And no date yet on the Xbox Live Arcade version, but soon.
4275780	4278420	So PlayStation 3 is sweet though.
4278420	4285340	And then finally, Rock Band is getting some new download content, including, well tonight
4285340	4298380	actually was the Who Super Bowl Smash Up Medley, and that was available for $2 or $2 in whatever
4298380	4301020	respective points you're spending.
4301020	4310220	Also this week will be another album as well, including Holy Wars, The Punishment Due, which
4310220	4313780	is for also $2.
4313780	4323780	Hangar 18, Take No Prisoners, Five Magics, Poison Was the Cure, Lucretia, Tornado of
4323780	4327940	Souls, Dawn Patrol, and Rust in Peace Polaris.
4327940	4332780	All those are available for $2 as well.
4332780	4336900	And that's of course off the Mega Death Hangar 18 album I believe.
4336900	4339620	Or no, Rust in Peace, my mistake.
4339620	4343620	Okay, well I've got some more news for you guys for some other types of games.
4343620	4346900	Not music based, but definitely a popular game folks are looking forward to.
4346900	4348620	ModNation Racers.
4348620	4350660	As you know, this game is coming out on the PlayStation 3.
4350660	4352660	Do we have a time frame when that game's coming out?
4352660	4353660	Is that summer?
4353660	4356220	It got delayed again, so June as of right now.
4356220	4359420	Well apparently, not only is there going to be a PlayStation 3 version, there's going
4359420	4361460	to be a PSP version launching out.
4361460	4362460	What?!
4362460	4364100	I know, I've never heard this news before.
4364100	4365560	Totally new news!
4365560	4369020	But anyway, just so you know, this game does have all the same tools that you'll find in
4369020	4372220	the PS3 version, but of course the graphics are going to be scaled down a little bit.
4372220	4377900	But you still get to make your own cars, your own racers, your own tracks, and you get to
4377900	4380980	share them with the PSP ModNation community.
4380980	4384260	You get to go online with it and race and all that fun stuff.
4384260	4390400	So PS3 and PSP versions launching side by side, very similar to LittleBigPlanet of course
4390400	4395340	also has the PS3 and PSP versions, but there was about a year break between the two.
4395340	4399220	Don't expect to see that same large window between these two releases.
4399220	4400940	Again, totally new news to me.
4400940	4402660	I haven't heard this anywhere before.
4402660	4408060	Hey, Civ Network is a popular anticipated Facebook game, at least at my house.
4408060	4412900	I'm really excited to play Civilization Network, but not going to get a chance to tell June.
4412900	4416780	Yeah that's when the Civilization Network beta is apparently happening, is June.
4416780	4421460	So yeah, Variety of all places is the one that made this report.
4421460	4424620	Yeah Variety, the magazine usually talks about movies and TV, well they have to talk about
4424620	4426820	games too when there's big stuff going on.
4426820	4431820	The beta for the new Facebook game, according to Variety, not starting until June.
4431820	4434980	By the way, this game was initially announced back in October, and that they were going
4434980	4438220	to do a beta tester hunt soon.
4438220	4441980	So soon means nine months.
4441980	4446860	So yeah, it's like saying, you know, I'm going to have a baby soon.
4446860	4450300	One other thing I got for you guys this week, a game lots and lots of people are talking
4450300	4454460	about, Mass Effect 2, is obviously a hugely popular title this week, and with good reason
4454460	4458820	from what I understand, I haven't played it myself, but I hear it's pretty fucking epic.
4458820	4462900	One thing though that is not epic is the size of the text, and if you're playing on a standard
4462900	4465780	television, you probably can't read it.
4465780	4467420	It's got the tiny text problem.
4467420	4470940	You know, you've heard about this in other games before, it's not just Mass Effect 2
4470940	4471940	that's had this problem.
4471940	4474500	I want to say The Lost Planet had this, some other games too.
4474500	4479660	And usually companies patch this problem so that you can actually read these on an SDTV.
4479660	4485700	Well guess what, according to the project manager Michael Gamble, let's see, quote,
4485700	4490020	we understand that on some SDTVs, the smallest text in Mass Effect 2 can be difficult to
4490020	4491020	read.
4491020	4494060	While this was not an intentional result, it was a byproduct of the enhancements to
4494060	4495460	the user interface.
4495460	4499180	After investigating potential solutions, we have determined that while this issue does
4499180	4503980	affect a small portion of SDTV owners, we are unable to resolve it for Mass Effect 2
4503980	4505300	through a title update.
4505300	4509940	So if you can't read the text on a small TV, it's time to buy a big TV.
4509940	4510940	Dr. Zara.
4510940	4515140	Well if you don't have a big TV, you should just get one anyway regardless.
4515140	4525300	Well the PSP Go is apparently getting a relaunch, even though the PSP Go is kind of crap anyway.
4525300	4530060	But Gamervision is saying that they're definitely going to have a relaunch and that there's
4530060	4531060	going to be a price drop.
4531060	4533540	So maybe that'll work, who knows?
4533540	4536500	I still think it's crap.
4536500	4547300	Also, for our DDR fans, DDR Universe 3, DDS Revolution Universe 3 is on Xbox 360 games
4547300	4548300	on demand.
4548300	4551680	So, get your $30 dollars ready if you want it.
4551680	4556500	Or save your money, because it was my least favorite of the Xbox 360 games.
4556500	4561340	And yeah, this is the thing that I actually bought a thousand cryptic points for.
4561340	4567420	Is that you can play a Ferengi or a Federation Klingon in Star Trek Online.
4567420	4571260	But it's like, you have to pay so much.
4571260	4572460	Okay, get this.
4572460	4577900	You pay 240 cryptic points for a Klingon, right?
4577900	4581300	You pay 80 for a Ferengi.
4581300	4582300	80.
4582300	4584380	What are they saying?
4584380	4585860	That maybe they just suck?
4585860	4589580	They should also have a character trait called greed, I think.
4589580	4593980	Isn't that a little weird though, that you bought this game, yet they're making you pay
4593980	4599020	extra to roll these classes that probably a lot of people want to do?
4599020	4600980	No.
4600980	4606060	I suppose WoW charges you for certain types of faction changes and so forth, but I can't
4606060	4610400	think of anything that's locked out without having to spend more money, except I suppose
4610400	4612620	actual expansion packs themselves, I don't know.
4612620	4616240	Well, the one thing that I want them to do is to make some of the pre-order special stuff
4616240	4621660	available for other people.
4621660	4624660	And also for some reason, my liberated Borg isn't showing up.
4624660	4628060	I haven't tried looking in the thing again, but I haven't been able to make a liberated
4628060	4629060	Borg for my bridge crew.
4629060	4630060	Uh oh.
4630060	4632940	Maybe soon I need to find out where that is.
4632940	4636180	But I mean, I'm just saying that the other thing too is that I bought more points so
4636180	4639220	I could buy a third character slot.
4639220	4640460	Are you only allowed two character slots?
4640460	4641460	Two character slots.
4641460	4643620	Are there multiple servers or is it just one giant server?
4643620	4644620	One big giant server.
4644620	4645620	Oh wow, that's kind of cool.
4645620	4650660	The other thing is they were having, if you buy a lifetime membership, then you can have,
4650660	4654620	you start off with four slots, and you have the year when you get like one more extra
4654620	4655620	slot, I think.
4655620	4656620	So I don't know.
4656620	4660380	I didn't, I don't have the money for a lifetime, although I'd pay for it.
4660380	4663820	Question from our chat room, from Amaze Satsuma, chat.orangelaunchradio.com, do the female
4663820	4665220	Ferengi wear clothes?
4665220	4669460	Yes, they do, and there's an explanation for that, because keep in mind, all of our DS9
4669460	4675020	buddies out there, Rom's the Grand Nagus, and he brought in social reform.
4675020	4678540	Let's go to Twitter topics.
4678540	4680780	Every week we invite you guys to send us your tweets.
4680780	4685940	Show us your tweets at username O-L-R and submit your topics for possible consideration
4685940	4686940	to be read on the show.
4686940	4689180	There's a few of them tonight, so I don't think we're going to read all of these, but
4689180	4690500	I'll read a few of these.
4690500	4698260	From Pod Culture, Twitter topic, collector's editions of video games, yay or nay?
4698260	4700820	I say yay depending on what you're into.
4700820	4702980	Some of the extras can be cool sometimes.
4702980	4708320	It gets a little weird though when there's like really game changing items that are only
4708320	4710220	available in the collector's edition.
4710220	4713060	I don't know, that's not cool to me.
4713060	4716060	But I mean if it's a game I really like, sure I'm going to get the collector's edition.
4716060	4719900	Like if there's a Final Fantasy 13 collector's edition, I'm probably buying it.
4719900	4721940	Logie, collector's editions, yay nay?
4721940	4724060	It all depends what's in it and how much it's for.
4724060	4727900	I don't even have to ask Jamie, she's thumbing through her Star Trek collector's edition
4727900	4728900	right now.
4728900	4732280	It came with an art book, it was cool, and a pen, and I get like all kinds of cool stuff
4732280	4733280	with it.
4733280	4738100	So if it's something that I really like, if there's something that I really, really like,
4738100	4743820	and you know me and I love stuff, I will get the collector's edition.
4743820	4748300	Going through some other tweets here, Alex Carson, interesting question.
4748300	4751300	I don't know if we're going to have much of an answer to this on Twitter.
4751300	4754940	What podcast do you guys like to tune into?
4754940	4757140	Please tell me one of you guys like Stignation.
4757140	4760380	Here's the thing, and I don't know if Logie and Jamie feel similarly, but I don't listen
4760380	4764340	to a lot of other podcasts because I don't want to be inadvertently influenced by what
4764340	4765900	I hear on other shows.
4765900	4767300	Like I'm all for you guys.
4767300	4768820	How John Tesh of you?
4768820	4772540	Well I'm all for you guys listening to independent shows and I think you should support other
4772540	4777720	independent radio, but I don't want to like hear something on one show and then like inadvertently
4777720	4779220	without knowing, copy it.
4779220	4780220	Does that make sense?
4780220	4781220	Yeah.
4781220	4782940	But I do support folks listening to other shows.
4782940	4783940	There are a few.
4783940	4784940	I've listened to more.
4784940	4788140	I drive to the Bay Area more often now because you know I date somebody that lives in the
4788140	4789620	Bay Area and it's about a two hour drive.
4789620	4792340	I have used podcasts to fill the gap.
4792340	4794860	Let me check with Dark Soccer and Logie though first before I answer.
4794860	4796900	I do have a couple podcasts I like.
4796900	4798380	Dark Soccer, Logie, anything?
4798380	4805880	I was listening to the Grammarcast for a while and there are a couple more like a few classic
4805880	4812620	gaming ones that I was listening to, but for the most part I actually don't really have
4812620	4813620	time.
4813620	4817740	I should set them up to download on my iPhone, but I hardly ever forget to update my iPhone
4817740	4818740	anyway.
4818740	4819740	Logie?
4819740	4821660	I don't really listen to other podcasts.
4821660	4824420	You can't at your work either because you're on the phone and stuff, right?
4824420	4829300	So I know a lot of people listen to some work to pass the time.
4829300	4836820	No, it's not, I just don't because, I don't know, I just don't.
4836820	4844340	I don't have time, well I probably have time during the day, but I just don't want to.
4844340	4847620	Not that I don't think there's good stuff out there, it's just I don't listen to radio
4847620	4848620	either.
4848620	4854860	I listen to my CD player, or I guess MP3 player right now that has like ten songs on it and
4854860	4858940	I loop them and I just don't care about adding new stuff to it.
4858940	4867100	So same thing with podcasts, I read the news, there's no, for me I'd probably listen to
4867100	4872080	the game podcasts and I read the news and stuff, so I don't really need to hear the
4872080	4873080	news again.
4873080	4880020	Wait a minute, you just told people to basically not listen to this show.
4880020	4881020	So be it, whatever.
4881020	4883540	I'm just telling you why I don't listen to it.
4883540	4888080	We like to talk about all the news too, not just, I mean we try to report, usually we're
4888080	4890460	not the ones breaking the news, but we talk about it.
4890460	4899140	There's absolutely no news breaking here other than, oh my god, ModNation Racers on PSP.
4899140	4902540	Let's see, podcasts I listen to, you know, I haven't listened to Dignation, I try to
4902540	4904780	stay away from some of the corporate ones.
4904780	4908220	I just think a lot of them aren't that great, although I will say there's an NPR podcast
4908220	4911540	that's kind of funny, the Wait Wait Don't Tell Me, it's like the game show-ish one that's
4911540	4912940	about the weekend news.
4912940	4915660	It kind of depends on what week it is and who's on the panel, but some of those are
4915660	4916660	really funny.
4916660	4921480	As far as video game podcasts go, I don't know how far I want to say this, like I have
4921480	4925380	tried listening to a corporate oriented podcast.
4925380	4930940	It was a very niche thing and I kind of found myself a little bit bored listening to it.
4930940	4932660	It was kind of a niche gaming podcast.
4932660	4937220	I kind of thought the hosts didn't have energy, like they didn't sound excited about what
4937220	4938220	they were talking about.
4938220	4942140	It was kind of like, hello and welcome to our show, we're going to talk about this topic
4942140	4943140	today.
4943140	4944820	As hosted by Bob Ross?
4944820	4951540	Kind of, like I shouldn't say negative things, but I just, a lot of corp podcasts, like dude,
4951540	4952540	you're even paid to be there.
4952540	4953540	Well yeah, exactly.
4953540	4954540	Be excited!
4954540	4957860	That and the corporate podcasts too, it's just like, hey, look at all these games that
4957860	4960420	the game publishers just dumped on our desk with gold and money.
4960420	4961980	Look at all this shit I get to play for free!
4961980	4966940	They literally shoved money into my pockets and I was just like, oh, I hate this job,
4966940	4968220	it's so awful.
4968220	4972580	To be fair, I know that gaming journalism is a very tough industry with very few jobs
4972580	4977480	and people work their asses off to stay in it, but at the same time, I found myself bored
4977480	4978660	listening to this particular podcast.
4978660	4982820	It's just like when we used to go to like Konami press days and stuff like that and
4982820	4987660	just the people there are, some of them are such douches.
4987660	4990820	Anyhow, I'm not going to linger on the negative, let me move to the positive because there
4990820	4993020	are some indie podcasts I've listened to that I like.
4993020	4996420	Obviously I like Bobby's show, but clearly I'm biased and Friday Night Gaming I think
4996420	4997940	is a great show too.
4997940	5000980	I actually listened to, and I really like the show, I've listened to it like three times
5000980	5005820	now on my drives to San Francisco, I like the Warcraft Outsiders.
5005820	5009340	It's the spinoff of Video Game Outsiders, which is a show kind of similar to us.
5009340	5014740	It's a girl and two guys who kind of drink and talk about the video game news, except
5014740	5015740	they all do it on Skype.
5015740	5018300	I think one of them is in Canada and I think the others are on the East Coast somewhere,
5018300	5021220	but they do like a spinoff show about Warcraft and I think it's pretty good.
5021220	5024140	The girl leads it and she's like a hardcore Raider healer.
5024140	5027700	I think her and her boyfriend play a lot and I think they're pretty well informed of what
5027700	5028700	they're talking about.
5028700	5032420	I think it has energy.
5032420	5036740	They enjoy what they're talking about, although one guy on the show, kind of the running gag
5036740	5040900	is that he doesn't really play Warcraft so why is he there, but they make it funny so
5040900	5041900	it works.
5041900	5047300	But they have energy, like when she talks about her rating and stuff, you can tell she
5047300	5051460	is having fun and she's doing a show about something she really likes and the guy too
5051460	5053340	and the guest host.
5053340	5058300	For those that want my opinion on what makes a good podcast, have fun on what you're talking
5058300	5059540	about.
5059540	5063460	Make people want to listen to you because you are excited and I try to have energy on
5063460	5065500	the show every week, even if I'm having a shit week.
5065500	5071980	And don't forget, we've also got the comic podcast too that Mar and Marvel and I do.
5071980	5075420	And we giggle and are excited!
5075420	5076420	So there you go.
5076420	5083780	Anyhow, let's see, let me move on to other comments on our Twitter.
5083780	5086260	Spazinator says, latest rumor.
5086260	5092460	Patrick Stewart is said to be a huge fan of handheld gaming, specifically on the N-Gage.
5092460	5093460	Get it?
5093460	5095260	Oh my god, did I really just read that joke?
5095260	5100420	See, let it not be said that we do not let every gamer have a voice, even when we should
5100420	5101740	probably throw tomatoes at them.
5101740	5102740	Waka waka waka.
5102740	5107180	You know, the bad joke of the week wouldn't be a bad idea, you know, that would be kind
5107180	5109180	of funny.
5109180	5112900	You get the OLR tomato award of the night, Spazinator, congratulations.
5112900	5114300	Here's one more Twitter question for you guys.
5114300	5118300	Blue Swim asks us, any word on President Cat coming here?
5118300	5119300	Nope.
5119300	5123540	PS Dark Sakura, I can have Mischief Makers as Classic Game of the Week?
5123540	5124700	Maybe.
5124700	5128020	As far as President Cat goes, we didn't hear anything after the whole little, you know,
5128020	5131980	gauntlet of stuff that happened that week.
5131980	5134700	I don't think it's happening.
5134700	5139180	You know, there was the negative stories about that it only sold 100 copies, which I still
5139180	5141380	say were bullshit.
5141380	5144120	I failed to see how that was possible.
5144120	5146020	Maybe 100 copies were imported to the US.
5146020	5149220	There is no way it sold 100 copies, I'm sorry.
5149220	5156100	I mean, even the crappiest of absolute shit that comes out on the Wii sells a lot of copies.
5156100	5158900	That's why they release stuff on the Wii.
5158900	5163020	It's because people are like, hey, it's a game, it's cheap, let me buy it.
5163020	5169140	You know, it could be, I don't know, it could be a game about working at a call center or
5169140	5170140	something.
5170140	5173140	Now, the Twitter account Rent a Wii has still been kind of making posts as of late, so they're
5173140	5176980	still kind of, you know, there, but I don't, I don't know.
5176980	5180820	I think at this point, I'm not holding my breath to see it released over here, but you
5180820	5181820	know, don't give up.
5181820	5186500	Continue to follow it and send them tweets, and I think the best case scenario at this
5186500	5190960	point is that someone kind of caught wind of this whole thing going on, and maybe we'll
5190960	5194340	see a game like President Cat.
5194340	5197700	But remember, there's a certain charm that President Cat had, and when you make a copy
5197700	5203180	of a copy, the quality declines, so just be very thoughtful in how you do that if you
5203180	5208460	are said publisher listening right now, thinking about cashing in on the President Cat craze.
5208460	5211140	I think, again, it would sell.
5211140	5212140	It would.
5212140	5216340	Let's get back into some long-form gaming news.
5216340	5220020	We'll read more of your tweets next week at Twitter.com slash O-L-R. The mailbag's coming
5220020	5221020	up, though.
5221020	5222940	I know Dark Soccer's gonna tear into that in just a moment, but we do have some news
5222940	5224740	before we get there, Loki.
5224740	5225740	Yes.
5225740	5231600	You may remember that there was a, well, there's been a few knockoff Wii systems out there.
5231600	5239340	One of them was Zone 40, which was just some, like, it looks sort of like a Wii, but not
5239340	5244460	quite, you know, and it had, you know, 40 little mini games.
5244460	5251700	Well, now, they have the officially licensed Sega Zone, which has 20 Genesis Classic games
5251700	5259840	and 30 new games, 16 of which are playable with the devices, two wireless motion controllers,
5259840	5268140	and yeah, and it's in the wonderful black and blue with the Sega logo on the side.
5268140	5270860	Trying to see what games are in there.
5270860	5272260	It's kind of hard to see.
5272260	5273260	Oh, wait, here we go.
5273260	5274260	Let me guess.
5274260	5275260	Sonic the Hedgehog?
5275260	5276260	Well, Sonic the Hedgehog, yes.
5276260	5279780	I mean, that's, you know, obvious.
5279780	5287220	Looks like Alex Kidd, Sonic and Knuckles, Columns 3, Eswat, Echo the Dolphin, Golden
5287220	5288220	Axe.
5288220	5290100	Every Sega compilation, basically.
5290100	5296620	Then, like, some of the other, like, arcade games that they have.
5296620	5300780	I think a lot of this is just some generic stuff, like, they have what looks like a boxing
5300780	5301780	game.
5301780	5302780	Looks like Wii boxing or something.
5302780	5304140	I can actually see the little picture here.
5304140	5305660	I got a blown up version of it.
5305660	5311900	Eswat, Sonic Spinball, Golden Axe, Shinobi, and then in the Sega games section, they have
5311900	5312900	Canon.
5312900	5317220	Well, no, that's the 14 arcade games section right below that.
5317220	5318780	Mr. Balls is one of them.
5318780	5319780	Oh, oh, oh, I see.
5319780	5320780	I see.
5320780	5327060	Bomber, Canon, yeah, I see that's a bottle caps race or something.
5327060	5332020	It's like they basically just, you know, copied over some of the, you know, crappy games that
5332020	5336020	were on there and put some Sega Genesis games on there.
5336020	5337540	And then some interactive sports games.
5337540	5338540	Look at that.
5338540	5343060	It's like Wii Sports, but with 16 different games, including darts, I see, and, uh, interesting.
5343060	5344060	Well it would-
5344060	5345060	Is that curling?
5345060	5346060	I believe it is.
5346060	5352980	It would all depend on what the price is and it says, um, I guess it's priced at, uh, $39.95,
5352980	5358300	uh, what is that, euros, I believe, so.
5358300	5359300	I don't know though.
5359300	5360300	I mean, it's-
5360300	5361300	50 pounds.
5361300	5362300	Cute, but-
5362300	5363300	50 pounds.
5363300	5364300	I think I'll pass on that.
5364300	5369500	Anyhow, um, I don't know how I feel about these games, but, uh, Wheel of Fortune and
5369500	5374860	Jeopardy, you know, these games, they're actually, I believe they're like Sony Pictures Entertainment,
5374860	5380660	um, game shows, but THQ has actually licensed the franchises to make video games based on
5380660	5381660	them.
5381660	5384540	I mean, it's not like it would be the first time ever a video game has been made out of
5384540	5385980	Wheel of Fortune or Jeopardy.
5385980	5391540	But it would be awesome if they were, I don't know, uh, one of the Xbox, you know.
5391540	5393020	That's what I'm saying.
5393020	5396340	That's where I was gonna go with this, is that, wouldn't that be cool if they actually,
5396340	5401100	I mean, to make these games more fun, did the whole, like, 1 versus 100 route and made
5401100	5403020	them, like, a little more interactive like that?
5403020	5409100	Honestly, 1 versus 100 is awesome and everything, but it's starting to get old, and, um, you
5409100	5412420	know, I thought there was supposed to be more than just one game on there.
5412420	5418260	And honestly, I've never played 1 versus 100 on, uh, you know, Xbox Live.
5418260	5419260	Just...
5419260	5420260	It's fun-ish.
5420260	5421260	Dan likes it.
5421260	5424140	I was number one one night on Video Game Trivia, like, halfway through.
5424140	5428740	I finally missed, I think I had a 26-question streak, and at one of the breaks, I was, like,
5428740	5429740	number one on the leaderboard.
5429740	5431300	I took a picture and posted it on Twitter and everything.
5431300	5433180	I talked about it a few weeks ago on the show.
5433180	5435620	Um, but, sadly, yeah, I finally failed.
5435620	5439700	I think the question I failed on was, um, oh, I remember it was the ESRB rating.
5439700	5441660	What was the ESRB rating for Worms 2?
5441660	5442660	I got it wrong.
5442660	5445060	Um, but anyway, it's, it's fun.
5445060	5447540	It's, playing the Xbox Live one can be fun.
5447540	5448820	But yeah, I get what you're saying, though.
5448820	5449820	It does get old.
5449820	5452460	A lot of these game show things get old, but if there was that variety, I think it could
5452460	5453460	be pretty cool.
5453460	5458740	Especially, like, Jeopardy, Wheel of Fortune, I think these could be cool games to do live.
5458740	5464220	Um, you know, with the whole, like, you know, I don't think everybody would just watch three
5464220	5465220	players.
5465220	5469220	But maybe if everybody got, you know how, like, 1 versus 100 splits you up into parties
5469220	5470220	of four?
5470220	5471220	Yeah.
5471220	5475140	Maybe if these games did that, it splits you up into random parties of three, and you played
5475140	5480260	a predetermined puzzle or predetermined set of questions, and then you can see, maybe,
5480260	5485340	at the end, who, out of all the matches, was, like, the top, who got the big, big score.
5485340	5488100	I mean, there's ways you could do it, I think, and make it fun.
5488100	5491620	But, sadly, I don't think THQ is going to be doing that, because, guess what?
5491620	5495700	They're actually going to be releasing them specifically on the Wii and the DS.
5495700	5500060	So, in other words, get ready to spin the wheel with your Wiimote.
5500060	5503380	And they're going to be as bad as successful as The Price is Right and the other games
5503380	5505900	that came out, which were not very much.
5505900	5508620	Yeah, I heard Press Your Luck and Price is Right weren't that bad.
5508620	5513500	But, anyway, later this year, when those first games are coming out, the statement, by the
5513500	5520160	way, about these games came from the THQ kids, family, and casual games executive VP, so
5520160	5523780	no hardcore wheel of fortune for you.
5523780	5525220	I am sorry to say.
5525220	5528540	I really wish they would go the live game show route, though, on Xbox Live.
5528540	5530300	I hope we do get some more of those.
5530300	5531300	I really do.
5531300	5534260	Wouldn't it be cool to actually have a live Press Your Luck?
5534260	5535500	I would love that!
5535500	5536860	Or a live Price is Right.
5536860	5537860	Old school.
5537860	5542260	I mean, imagine, like, you could be in the audience with your little avatar higher, higher,
5542260	5543260	lower.
5543260	5545980	Do you have a Plinko party?
5545980	5549100	There's so much more that can be done, and I hope it is done.
5549100	5553100	Well, how about something, though, that's good news for a lot of people.
5553100	5560180	There's Fallout Las- sorry, Fallout New Vegas will be out summer 2010.
5560180	5562840	There's actually a trailer up and everything.
5562840	5568060	It's being developed by Obsidian Entertainment, the same people that gave us Knights of the
5568060	5573380	Old Republic 2, Neverwinter Knights 2, and this is going to be a direct follow-up to
5573380	5574380	Fallout 3.
5574380	5576380	You look kind of neat.
5576380	5579180	I just know a lot of people like Fallout.
5579180	5582380	Oh yeah, Fallout's a hugely popular game, especially number 3.
5582380	5583740	It's one of those games I have yet to play.
5583740	5587780	It's in my little rental queue, but I haven't gotten the game yet.
5587780	5591700	But I hear it's Oblivion with guns, but so much came out, you know, we don't have time
5591700	5595460	to play every single video game, but I'll try to get around to it, at least before Final
5595460	5600620	Fantasy XIII comes out, because when that comes out, yeah, I'm not really going to be
5600620	5603180	playing anything else for a while.
5603180	5606180	I know myself.
5606180	5607660	So sad.
5607660	5610340	All these games.
5610340	5612940	So this is kind of interesting.
5612940	5617100	You may remember back when we talked a little bit about how Walmart and Best Buy were kind
5617100	5622700	of getting into this kiosk trade-in type of business.
5622700	5628180	They're going to be able to buy, sell, trade games, also rent out games, and I believe
5628180	5630900	DVDs as well.
5630900	5638460	Problem is, though, the company behind it, ePlay, has ceased operations.
5638460	5644860	So I don't know if that means closing or out of business or whatever, but they're no longer
5644860	5649020	operating, if you will.
5649020	5654340	So unfortunately that will probably go away, which is too bad, because I hear that their
5654340	5657580	trade-in values are pretty good.
5657580	5662100	Not true, though, if you're doing that in Canada, because I believe actually in Canada
5662100	5666700	Best Buy actually handles their trade-ins in the store and not through a kiosk, so that's
5666700	5668700	kind of cool.
5668700	5680100	Also GameCrazy, apparently the parent company movie gallery has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
5680100	5687660	again, and they're only basically going to drop it down to only 250 GameCrazy locations
5687660	5694240	once they're done and be liquidating close to 760 stores.
5694240	5695660	I can vouch for that.
5695660	5699060	That's a lot of depressing news in the retail world.
5699060	5700060	Yeah.
5700060	5701060	That's something that hits home here.
5701060	5702060	Oh, sure, I'm sure.
5702060	5704500	Do you know yet if everything's going to be okay?
5704500	5707540	We're thinking that the Cameron Park store is going to be okay.
5707540	5708540	That's cool.
5708540	5709540	All right.
5709540	5710540	Well, good luck.
5710540	5711540	I hope everything turns out all right.
5711540	5712540	Me too.
5712540	5713540	You know, I like living in a house.
5713540	5714540	Yeah.
5714540	5715700	Anyhow, on to happier news.
5715700	5720660	Some of the comments in chat still talking about the whole ideas of game shows on Xbox
5720660	5725660	Live, and I think SSJ 100 Matt totally has the winner idea of what games should be on
5725660	5726860	Xbox Live.
5726860	5729860	You ready?
5729860	5738280	Ah, yes, the match game.
5738280	5741580	If only they could find a way to bring back Brett Summers and Charles Nelson Riley from
5741580	5742580	the dead.
5742580	5744580	It'd be amazing.
5744580	5745740	Kind of a sad face news.
5745740	5747340	You know I'm big on live journal, right?
5747340	5752100	One of my good friends that I've had on live journal for years now ran a community on live
5752100	5756860	journal called Match Game LJ, which, you know, kind of did like a little live journal version
5756860	5757860	of the match game every week.
5757860	5761460	He decided to close it down this week, and he's not going to be running it anymore.
5761460	5763220	Give me sad face.
5763220	5766800	So what up, Mark, if you're listening, although I doubt he is, but yes, match game should
5766800	5767800	be on Xbox Live.
5767800	5768800	That would be wonderful.
5768800	5770800	I would love that.
5770800	5771800	All right.
5771800	5772860	On to some other news.
5772860	5776900	This is definitely kind of an eyebrow raising piece here from Harmonics.
5776900	5781460	Harmonics has apparently done some more licensing, and this really isn't a big surprise when
5781460	5785140	you consider, oh yeah, duh, Harmonics makes music games, and you know, they license stuff
5785140	5787300	for Rock Band 2 all of the time.
5787300	5790900	But look at some of the things they've been licensing lately.
5790900	5792460	This is all from the Royalty Network.
5792460	5794620	I guess some people were watching there.
5794620	5802900	Anti Up by M.O.P., Say Ah by Trey Songs, Evacuate the Dance Floor by Cascada, The Way I Are
5802900	5805780	by Timbaland featuring DOE.
5805780	5808700	Those are all like dancy, poppy songs.
5808700	5811140	They don't belong in Rock Band.
5811140	5812340	Or do they?
5812340	5815900	Or what is going on at Camp Harmonics?
5815900	5817120	Hmm.
5817120	5820660	Could it be that Harmo- now there's a couple options here.
5820660	5824940	Harmonics could be looking at going a really radically different direction with Rock Band
5824940	5827740	3, perhaps.
5827740	5832340	It could be that they have a DJ, other type of like DJ Hero-ish game in the works, some
5832340	5834140	answer to that.
5834140	5840540	It could be that they have a DDR response in the works, a dance game, maybe a pop band
5840540	5841540	type of game.
5841540	5842540	Who knows?
5842540	5843540	Dancing.
5843540	5844540	Who knows?
5844540	5845540	What do you think?
5845540	5846540	Or just a karaoke game.
5846540	5848060	A karaoke game?
5848060	5852100	Although Harmonics did the original Karaoke Revolution, I mean I couldn't see Harmonics
5852100	5855500	doing just a karaoke game when there's so many on the market now and they're already
5855500	5856500	into Rock Band.
5856500	5857500	I don't know.
5857500	5859340	I've got to admit, you know what I'm tempted to say?
5859340	5863140	I just- my gut tells me it's a dance game.
5863140	5867700	That they're going to try to take the dance game crown from Konami and now's a pretty
5867700	5870580	good time, honestly.
5870580	5873260	They could do it.
5873260	5874900	I don't know, what do you guys think?
5874900	5880100	Obviously this is a topic that hits home here at OLR.
5880100	5881980	This show started over DDR.
5881980	5887660	The dance genre is really that popular anymore, I mean, I guess you've seen a couple titles
5887660	5892060	that are really kind of stand out now, but they're a little bit different than DDR, like
5892060	5896660	Just Dance is a title that I'm surprised is doing okay.
5896660	5901260	Actually, I have some co-workers, and I always talk about co-workers because that's my way
5901260	5903580	to gauge the casual gamer.
5903580	5907540	Do some of my co-workers that I would not imagine played a lot of Nintendo Wii love
5907540	5910100	Just Dance, and think it's like, great.
5910100	5913700	And I've heard some people on the show talking highly about it too, some of our chatters
5913700	5914700	and stuff.
5914700	5919280	Apparently it's this big cult music game that's doing very well, culty type.
5919280	5921860	I gotta play it at some point.
5921860	5924060	But anyway, sorry, what was the rest of your thought there?
5924060	5927500	No, I'm just surprised that, you know, that's doing well.
5927500	5934620	So I'm not sure if they would be going, like, that route though.
5934620	5938860	Frisbee in our chatroom says Konami doesn't have the crown, StepMania does.
5938860	5943900	I'm just gonna say this and rip it off like a bandaid here and just kind of give you my
5943900	5944900	thought here.
5944900	5947420	StepMania is not legitimate.
5947420	5950780	I know that probably sucks to hear, and I know it's got a big community and everything,
5950780	5952660	but it's not legitimate.
5952660	5953660	Neither is In the Groove.
5953660	5957340	Do you, well, In the Groove is a step above StepMania.
5957340	5961100	In the Groove was the way to try and legitimize StepMania, but let me put it this way.
5961100	5964740	You do not walk into a GameStop and buy StepMania over the counter.
5964740	5966060	Or do you really buy StepMania at all?
5966060	5968180	I mean, it's just not, it's not the same.
5968180	5971040	StepMania was always there to emulate DDR.
5971040	5973960	And then yeah, they tried to kind of innovate it later, especially within the Groove and
5973960	5979400	so forth, but it's not, I mean, I could see Harmonix doing what Konami should have done
5979400	5985260	about six years ago and reinventing DDR from the ground up, which supposedly is also happening
5985260	5986620	by Konami right now.
5986620	5990420	I haven't heard what's up with that DDR game they're supposed to be putting out with eight
5990420	5991420	panels.
5991420	5992420	Like, wasn't that supposed to be out last Christmas?
5992420	5993420	It got delayed.
5993420	5994420	Uh, yeah.
5994420	6001180	It was supposed to be actually out this spring, and it still hasn't been released yet.
6001180	6007820	I think probably the second quarter, but even still, it's just, I can't get excited about
6007820	6008820	it.
6008820	6015060	I go to DDRfreak.com and let's see, do I see anything about the new DDR game?
6015060	6022300	Let's see, DDRfreak, Pump It Up Pro 2, StepMania, the manga, DJ Hero Deal, Cobalt Flux, back
6022300	6025900	in November, $40 Amazon credit with various hero bundles.
6025900	6026900	Yeah.
6026900	6028680	There's no news on DDR and even DDRfreak.
6028680	6033540	I mean, that is a sign about how Konami has fumbled and dropped the DDR crown.
6033540	6038860	I think if Harmonix were to show up at E3 with a new dance game, with not, I hate to
6038860	6041860	say it guys, I know I'm going to piss some of you off with this comment, but without
6041860	6045620	the J-pop and the stuff that most people on this side of the ocean don't know, but stuff
6045620	6050860	like Timberland and Cascada and people actually recognize from clubs, uh, Harmonix is going
6050860	6057860	to, they're going to do to DDR what they did to Guitar Hero, or Guitar Freaks, sorry, with
6057860	6058860	Guitar Hero.
6058860	6060140	That could be what we're looking at.
6060140	6062140	Well, we'll just have to wait and see.
6062140	6065660	And it could be not, it could be that Rock Band 3, I mean, again, this is all speculation.
6065660	6070860	I don't know why my gut just tells me Konami is vulnerable right now.
6070860	6074780	If DDRfreak can't even tell you the latest and what's going on with eight panel DDR and
6074780	6079260	this whole reinvention of the franchise, I mean, hello, something is wrong.
6079260	6080260	Right?
6080260	6081260	Yeah.
6081260	6085460	You know, we technically do have eight panel DDR, Rob.
6085460	6086460	Doubles.
6086460	6087460	You know what I'm talking about.
6087460	6088460	I know.
6088460	6089460	I know.
6089460	6090460	Well, just like quad mode.
6090460	6091860	How did that ever catch on?
6091860	6092860	I don't know.
6092860	6096580	Dark Tetsuya is saying, so Rob, are you saying DDR is dead?
6096580	6099580	Um, well, yes.
6099580	6102740	It kind of died about five years ago.
6102740	6105780	Around the time this show stopped talking about DDR was kind of when it was starting
6105780	6106780	to die.
6106780	6111860	I mean, I hate to say it, but I don't think it'll ever die, but it's not what it was 10
6111860	6113380	years ago.
6113380	6114820	Let's face it.
6114820	6115820	Reality check.
6115820	6116820	All right.
6116820	6121580	Anyhow, hey, let's get into some more pleasant topics and talk a little bit about, uh, what
6121580	6123940	is going on in our email bag.
6123940	6124940	That's right.
6124940	6130480	Every week we invite you guys to send us emails to our email address at mailbagorangeloungeradio.com.
6130480	6134340	And every week Dark Sakura likes to tear the mailbag open and read some of her favorite
6134340	6137380	emails for us to respond to here on the show.
6137380	6142380	So Dark Sakura dive into the mailbag and tell us what emails are we getting this week?
6142380	6145900	Well, we got one recent, it was one of the ones that were deleted when I was getting
6145900	6146900	rid of the spam.
6146900	6149220	Um, so I'll go ahead and read it first.
6149220	6151380	Um, hi, OLR crew, AZHP here.
6151380	6155820	I was listening to your podcast from the 10th and her Jamie brush off the rock star forced
6155820	6158620	overtime deal because they would get time and a half.
6158620	6161980	I work in the programming industry as well, and I can tell you with a percent certainty
6161980	6165860	that pretty much no one in the entire industry in California gets paid a cent of overtime
6165860	6166860	furthermore.
6166860	6169820	And this is generally the norm for the games industry in general.
6169820	6173980	Employees are forced to work 12 hours, six to seven days a week with no overtime pay,
6173980	6178900	no compensation for PTO, no bonuses, and sometimes even no vacation by the way, PTO is paid time
6178900	6181900	off for those who don't speak office speak.
6181900	6184620	Sometimes even a vacation after project is finished.
6184620	6188340	There are also generally threats of dismissal if one does not go into work.
6188340	6193460	These people are so fatigued getting one or zero days off that week, they make them more
6193460	6196840	and more mistakes and they have to stay even longer to fix them.
6196840	6200400	There is a law in California that says you can be exempt from getting paid overtime if
6200400	6203020	you make more than $90,000 in a year.
6203020	6206040	However, game developers generally make about half that.
6206040	6212880	It might seem like a decent salary, but when you're working 100 hours, 100 hour work weeks,
6212880	6215300	it equates to about $14 an hour.
6215300	6217500	Now you might say, take it up with the law or quit.
6217500	6221140	However, these people are so overworked that they don't have the time to file a lawsuit.
6221140	6224620	And getting into the industry is so hard because there are so few studios owned by even fewer
6224620	6228740	publishers that it's 100 times harder to get a job in the games industry than it is any
6228740	6230900	other job, especially in our economic climate.
6230900	6234580	I'm sorry for the lengthy rant, but I was appalled at the complacency of the crew on
6234580	6238340	reporting on the story and wanted everyone to know the true nature of the beast so that
6238340	6241960	they could understand what most game developers go through to bring you the games you love
6241960	6242960	to play.
6242960	6243960	Yours truly, AZHP.
6243960	6246300	PS, sorry about the terrible Silent Hill joke last time.
6246300	6247300	I just had to.
6247300	6253140	Now my point is, is that it's because no one says anything that this shit continues.
6253140	6255280	I kind of, I sort of agree.
6255280	6257780	Like I don't, I don't want to say I'm complacent with this.
6257780	6261540	I mean it does strike me as very wrong, but at the same time I feel like I don't know
6261540	6265720	enough about that perspective because most of the people I know that work for developers
6265720	6267580	aren't making these same complaints.
6267580	6270860	And I don't know if it's because of, and it's addressed in that email, the fear of if they
6270860	6272900	speak up, they're going to get fired.
6272900	6277260	But if everything that's in that email is true, that's bullshit.
6277260	6278300	Of course it's bullshit.
6278300	6282620	And maybe the wife should be speaking up and somebody has got to stand up for these people
6282620	6284100	and put a stop to this.
6284100	6287060	By the way though, you don't have to make 90,000 a year to be exempt from overtime.
6287060	6288060	Trust me, I know.
6288060	6289060	Yeah, no.
6289060	6293860	But if you, if you are an exempt employee, then your overtime is counted in other ways.
6293860	6297500	But yes, there are still boundaries.
6297500	6302060	You know, I, I don't like to talk a lot about my day job because I don't want to ever jeopardize
6302060	6303060	that here on the show.
6303060	6304620	But I will say these few key things.
6304620	6309900	I am an exempt employee where I work, but anytime I do have to work those extra hours,
6309900	6313380	my company is very good about balancing it out.
6313380	6314380	I don't ever feel...
6314380	6315860	You get basically comped time, right?
6315860	6316860	In a way.
6316860	6320380	I think I should reveal those types of things on the show, but you know, there, there, there
6320380	6324380	are ways they make up for it and I don't feel overworked and everybody should have that.
6324380	6327540	I've had times at my job where they say, oh, we've got mandatory overtime this weekend.
6327540	6329940	And I'm like, I'm not coming.
6329940	6330940	Why not?
6330940	6332400	Um, I'm not coming.
6332400	6333820	I have other things to do.
6333820	6334820	I made plans.
6334820	6335820	Sorry, I'm not coming.
6335820	6338180	And they'll be like, oh, well, okay.
6338180	6341780	Cause they cannot make you work mandatory overtime.
6341780	6347060	They just say mandatory because they're strongly suggesting it because they need to have the
6347060	6348060	people there.
6348060	6352740	And maybe it's mandatory for them to request the overtime, but it's not mandatory that
6352740	6353740	you take it.
6353740	6357460	That you, you know, go in and work on your day off.
6357460	6359540	We have a law for a reason.
6359540	6366820	And if, I'm sorry, I really don't feel very sorry for these people who, well, okay.
6366820	6370640	I actually, no, I don't feel sorry because yeah, it sucks that they have, they're having
6370640	6375420	such a hard time, but as long as they're not doing anything to change it, you know, then
6375420	6377460	they're just adding to the problem.
6377460	6378460	They're adding to the problem.
6378460	6379660	Well, maybe that's why the wives are speaking out.
6379660	6383020	Maybe, maybe people, I mean, I can see what he's saying in the email there about there
6383020	6386580	is a very real fear that if I speak up, I'm going to be fired.
6386580	6387900	I could see that.
6387900	6388900	But that's illegal.
6388900	6390900	It's a tough industry to crack into.
6390900	6393880	But it still doesn't change the fact of what the law is.
6393880	6398140	I don't want to get too political here, but is it just throwing ideas out there?
6398140	6404260	Is it possible that there could be a union of developers and people that work in the
6404260	6405260	game industry?
6405260	6406500	I mean, maybe that's what's needed.
6406500	6407500	I would say so.
6407500	6411180	I mean, if, if it seems like- Do we need Sally Field to jump up on a table
6411180	6415020	with her sign about starting a union?
6415020	6424500	Well, I, I think that if anyone is working in that kind of condition, the, it doesn't
6424500	6426460	matter how exhausted they are.
6426460	6433220	You know, if someone does not think enough of themselves, their family, and doing work
6433220	6439140	that they enjoy to try to make their workplace a better place to be, then they don't need
6439140	6440140	to be there.
6440140	6443540	Uh, one of our listeners in chat, I'll, I'll, I'll withhold their name here because they
6443540	6447780	are saying something somewhat negative, uh, says, it's hard to say no to our Sakura.
6447780	6453620	Once is okay, twice you don't get a raise and all the industry is connected.
6453620	6456140	I mean, I, he's speaking to that same fear.
6456140	6458820	I mean, I get what you're saying, but I get what he's saying.
6458820	6461300	There's got, something has to give.
6461300	6462300	You know what I mean?
6462300	6463300	Well, that goes back to the same thing.
6463300	6466780	If you are unhappy with the environment, you change it.
6466780	6470660	You know, one person may be one person, but for every one person that has a particular,
6470660	6476280	uh, distaste for something, there are going to be at least eight other people around them,
6476280	6480060	very close to them that have that same feeling.
6480060	6483540	And sometimes all it takes is for one person to say something before everybody else decides,
6483540	6485100	Hey, yeah, we agree.
6485100	6487420	Well, this issue is long from over.
6487420	6488460	I'm sure about that.
6488460	6490940	Maybe it's going to end up being the wives that take this on.
6490940	6491940	I don't know.
6491940	6494460	It's going to be very interesting to see what develops, but for now we should probably move
6494460	6498780	on to another email.
6498780	6500620	One comes from lucky nuts.
6500620	6503340	Hey, Jamie keeps talking about her vault.
6503340	6508060	I too have a vault that I've kept for the last 20 years or so, and I'm considering spending
6508060	6512900	the next few months clearing it out on eBay to buy more grownup things like a new sailboat.
6512900	6515820	Have you ever thought about clearing out your collection and if so, did you later regret
6515820	6516820	it?
6516820	6520260	Um, first of all, grownup is a concept.
6520260	6526660	You know, you're getting rid of one thing for recreation to get another thing for recreation.
6526660	6528500	Grownup is bullshit.
6528500	6531140	You know, so drop that little attitude right there.
6531140	6536660	I hate that attitude so much and no, I'm not getting rid of the collection ever.
6536660	6537660	I love our collection.
6537660	6538660	I go back and use all this stuff.
6538660	6540780	I get, I'm happy just looking at it.
6540780	6544940	Like, I like going in the vault and just looking around and going, damn, we got some cool shit.
6544940	6545940	Look at all this shit.
6545940	6546940	I know.
6546940	6547940	That's just how I feel.
6547940	6551660	And then she'll invite other people over, Rob, Rob, come over and look at all my shit.
6551660	6554660	Come over here and help me play with this.
6554660	6559500	You know, and by the way, if you go to our YouTube channel, um, you can actually see
6559500	6563220	some video taken in the vault if you want to see what I have.
6563220	6566140	And if you are going to sell some of your stuff though, talk to me.
6566140	6567140	Nice.
6567140	6569660	Maybe you'll have something I want.
6569660	6574580	I just to say from, from a non-collector perspective, I've sold some of my stuff.
6574580	6577900	I've never really regretted it though, cause I try to really think about it and not sell
6577900	6580060	anything that I think I might remotely play again.
6580060	6583860	Like I think I sold my copy of Dead or Alive for, I just knew I wasn't going to play that
6583860	6584860	again.
6584860	6587460	Misty said she was happy looking at it while she was visiting.
6587460	6589780	There you go.
6589780	6594220	Um, now I did get two emails from one other person, but I'm only going to read one of
6594220	6598540	them because really the first one was all like, I like Silent Hill Shattered Memories.
6598540	6602880	Can I say though real quick though, if you did sell your collection and buy the sailboat,
6602880	6607740	you know that you could say, I'm on a boat.
6607740	6609580	You know, that's one of my ringtones on my phone.
6609580	6610580	Is it?
6610580	6611580	I'm not surprised.
6611580	6613020	It's the one when, uh, when work calls.
6613020	6614100	That's why you buy the sailboat.
6614100	6615100	You want to say I'm on a boat.
6615100	6617020	I don't want to be on a boat.
6617020	6619940	I want to play my games.
6619940	6621380	Games are more versatile than a sailboat.
6621380	6625420	You can, you can go in your house unless your electricity is off.
6625420	6627620	You can play your games anytime.
6627620	6630620	That's a dark Sakura song would be, I got a vault.
6630620	6632420	I got a vault, motherfucker.
6632420	6633420	A vault.
6633420	6637700	But you can only go on your sailboat, first of all, if you're licensed for it.
6637700	6641620	A sailboat is going to give you a lot more cost and upkeep and storage.
6641620	6646500	Dude, you're going to save yourself some money just by keeping your games and renting a boat
6646500	6647620	for a weekend.
6647620	6648620	The end.
6648620	6650860	Cause then you don't have to do all the crap to it.
6650860	6652260	God, I'm smart.
6652260	6656140	I should just be a financial advisor even though I kind of, you know, kind of suck at
6656140	6657140	it.
6657140	6658140	You're a goddamn boat idiot.
6658140	6660380	You don't need a boat.
6660380	6662540	You need a- Fuck boats.
6662540	6663540	Rent it.
6663540	6665340	Jamie, you need a- Charter a boat.
6665340	6668100	Jamie, you need a financial advice podcast.
6668100	6669100	Fuck no.
6669100	6675120	It would be nothing but Dan yelling at me for spending too much money on comics.
6675120	6676120	Fuck rent.
6676120	6677120	Buy comics.
6677120	6681340	So anyway, I'm going to read just the one email.
6681340	6687620	Um, hello from Haseo- Haseo Sumiragawa.
6687620	6695540	Yeah this person, um, is, uh, yeah, anyway, and yes, DarkSakura, my grammar has greatly
6695540	6701780	improved except you're not using any capital letters and you misspelled grammar.
6701780	6706140	I was wondering if you guys have ever played the MMO Mabinogi.
6706140	6709720	If so, have you- why have you guys never mentioned it?
6709720	6710820	Because we haven't.
6710820	6711820	Never heard of it.
6711820	6712820	Ever.
6712820	6713820	Why not try it?
6713820	6719260	I mean, it's a lot like World of Warcraft except for Mabi is PS3, the two- okay, is
6719260	6724340	the PS3 of the two you pay for nothing except pet next to your characters unless you are
6724340	6725340	smart enough?
6725340	6726340	Uh, whatever.
6726340	6727340	Is this spam?
6727340	6728340	No, it's- Alright, just checking.
6728340	6733340	You know, I'm wondering if you- I really can't read this.
6733340	6737540	Do you know how easy it would be to- okay, I'll come stand behind you.
6737540	6742860	Okay, also on another note, the gift Rob got from Loki, where would I find when you can
6742860	6745600	play an NES game on it?
6745600	6747580	It's an FC Mobile, look it up online.
6747580	6748580	eBay.
6748580	6752300	Also I make AMVs from video- there's actually a couple sites that sell them to you.
6752300	6757100	Also I make AMVs from video games and I was wondering, can you guys have any ideas for
6757100	6758100	an AMV?
6758100	6761980	Yes, there should be an AMV where the main character is learning proper spelling and
6761980	6762980	grammar.
6762980	6764400	It'd be fascinating.
6764400	6765900	Also update the podcast more often.
6765900	6766900	Probably not.
6766900	6767900	Okay, dude.
6767900	6768900	I'm sorry.
6768900	6772460	Also, spammers need to be raped with a flaya warhead.
6772460	6775340	Now that I can get behind.
6775340	6776340	No pun intended.
6776340	6782260	I'm sorry, I- you're- I can't read your email because it doesn't make sense in my brain.
6782260	6787660	I'm sorry, I'll look at your YouTube videos, but your email hurts my head.
6787660	6788660	Alright.
6788660	6789660	I'm sorry.
6789660	6790660	I tried!
6790660	6792660	Are there any other emails?
6792660	6795500	No, well there was another one written by the same person, but again-
6795500	6797220	Yes, read it, please, please, please!
6797220	6799220	I love Silent Hill.
6799220	6800220	Okay, fine!
6800220	6801220	Shit.
6801220	6805620	Okay, first off, this was the first Silent Hill game I've played, so be nice, DarkSakura.
6805620	6807180	Do I have to?
6807180	6809740	Okay, this is a remake of the original- Too late.
6809740	6812220	You play as Harry Masons whose daughter is missing, blah blah blah.
6812220	6813900	We know all that.
6813900	6816420	Um, the gameplay is seamless.
6816420	6826900	Love the PSP, your trusty flashlight, adds an extra compen- commentary pending what you're
6826900	6827900	looking at.
6827900	6828900	Yeah.
6828900	6829900	Sorry, I can't.
6829900	6835220	Also, though, but I do like this, the nightmare sequences are a pain in the ass without weapons.
6835220	6838820	Um, go back and play the first Silent Hill.
6838820	6839820	Can I try?
6839820	6840820	Can I try reading the review?
6840820	6842140	Would you mind if I give it a shot?
6842140	6843140	Give it a try, Rob.
6843140	6846300	Hold on one minute, I'm gonna- I gotta bring it up here in studio here, and I will read
6846300	6847300	the review for you guys.
6847300	6848300	Okay, cause it's really bad.
6848300	6849300	Okay, hold on.
6849300	6850820	Alright, hold on, I'm getting in there.
6850820	6852420	Let's see, what is- Silent Hill Shadow Memories?
6852420	6854100	That would be the one.
6854100	6861540	Will this review involve- Okay, first off, this was the first Silent Hill game I've played,
6861540	6863540	so be nice, DarkSakura.
6863540	6865620	First off, this is a remake of the original.
6865620	6868920	You play as Harry Mason whose daughter is missing, and you travel through the mysterious
6868920	6871860	small town of Silent while searching for her.
6871860	6873940	Gameplay is seamless of the PSP.
6873940	6877780	Your trusty flashlight adds an extra commentary pending what you are looking at.
6877780	6882140	You have a cell phone to take pictures of static memoirs and whatnot.
6882140	6887480	The most annoying part of the game is the physiatrist who pops up and pisses you off,
6887480	6890940	and the nightmare sequences are a pain in the ass without weapons.
6890940	6895960	The story changes pending on how you talk with the physiarist you could get ending where
6895960	6899500	she's not found or one where blah blah blah spoilers.
6899500	6902180	The game is more fuck with your head than super scary.
6902180	6906220	I give it a 4.5 out of 5.
6906220	6911140	I thought for sure you were going to use one of the audio effects on our new mixing board,
6911140	6912300	but I was wrong.
6912300	6913300	You went back old dude.
6913300	6914300	Echo voice, Rob!
6914300	6915300	Echo voice!
6915300	6916300	You want echo voice?
6916300	6917300	Echo voice.
6917300	6918300	Hold on.
6918300	6919300	Ooh.
6919300	6922300	I own your soul.
6922300	6923300	Whoa!
6923300	6929140	I give it a 4.5 out of 5.
6929140	6930260	Okay that's enough of that for real.
6930260	6932860	It sounds like you're at the back end of a tunnel Rob.
6932860	6933860	Alright.
6933860	6935940	New mixing boards are fun.
6935940	6936940	That's it for the mailbag?
6936940	6937940	Yep.
6937940	6938940	Alright.
6938940	6944380	Uh, let's move on then to the FUs of the week because sometimes we get angsty here on this
6944380	6945380	show.
6945380	6946380	That poor guy is never going to email us again.
6946380	6949420	But if you want to have your emails ready to kill, please send them to mailbag at orange
6949420	6950700	launch radio dot com.
6950700	6954940	Just remember, we have Yakety Sax ready to go whenever we need it.
6954940	6973660	We also have the angsty music ready to go for the FUs of the week.
6973660	6974660	Fuck you Cryptic.
6974660	6977780	For your damn servers.
6977780	6981620	Make your servers hold more people so that I don't have to play a laggy STO.
6981620	6982620	The end.
6982620	6983620	Loki.
6983620	6990300	FU to people that break into my car and apparently there is a dude, or somebody, I'm assuming
6990300	6996620	it's a dude, that broke into my car last night because I had boxes in the back of my car
6996620	7002700	to give to my coworker who's moving and those boxes were of a microwave and computers and
7002700	7003700	whatnot.
7003700	7006660	And so they thought, hey look, microwave and computers.
7006660	7010340	So they broke the back window, pulled the box out and go, hey, this is a box.
7010340	7012220	What the hell is this?
7012220	7017660	Unfortunately under those boxes was my rifle bag with all my airsoft guns and they decided
7017660	7019460	to take that in protest.
7019460	7021420	So I am without airsoft guns.
7021420	7023460	So you gave a thief guns.
7023460	7024460	Good move, Loki.
7024460	7025460	I gave a thief fake guns.
7025460	7029660	Well, I gave him guns without batteries or any of the ammo because he didn't take any
7029660	7030660	of the ammo.
7030660	7031940	It was just sitting right there.
7031940	7032940	Whatever.
7032940	7036500	You know, I don't care because I haven't played airsoft in over a year or so.
7036500	7042260	It's so sad, but if I want more airsoft guns I'll just buy more.
7042260	7043260	I have arcade stuff to play.
7043260	7050220	I don't have time to play airsoft and it's been too, the weather's been crappy, so.
7050220	7055940	It's unfortunate, but it's not like, I'm not sad by it at all.
7055940	7064420	Well, if that's it for your FU of the week, mine would be just more moving angst and cleaning
7064420	7070220	and putting things in boxes and moving it and yeah, it's everything that comes with
7070220	7074220	moving, but I'll be over it in a couple of weeks when it's over, I'm sure.
7074220	7075220	Otherwise things are good.
7075220	7076460	I don't have a lot to complain about.
7076460	7077460	Life is happy.
7077460	7078460	Yay.
7078460	7079460	Butterflies and sparkles.
7079460	7080460	All right.
7080460	7083380	A couple more news stories for you guys and then your chance to interact with us live
7083380	7088540	on the phone on our Skype line at orange lounge radio or one eight seven seven game O L R
7088540	7089540	okay.
7089540	7090540	Yes.
7090540	7095900	Uh, Dante's Inferno is getting some download content, which I think is bundled actually
7095900	7097820	with the PlayStation three version.
7097820	7105580	Um, apparently someone got the game early or downloaded the game early and, um, recorded
7105580	7110240	a video that they sent to Kotaku, which shows a new download content that's going to have
7110240	7115940	some new online, um, co-op actually a new playable character along with that.
7115940	7119800	And there's some different, uh, trials apparently that you can play and you can create your
7119800	7122420	own new trials and share them online.
7122420	7124420	So that's kind of neat.
7124420	7131060	Um, but apparently if, uh, it's not in the PS three version, I know it's definitely not
7131060	7132440	in the three 60 version.
7132440	7136020	So if you do have the three 60, uh, you'll have to get it in April.
7136020	7142260	Um, hopefully it is included in the PS three version, in which case you'll get it immediately.
7142260	7143780	But that's neat.
7143780	7149060	And um, I don't know if it's going to be free later on, but it's, uh, apparently a trailer
7149060	7150780	that's on the disc.
7150780	7151780	So.
7151780	7152780	All righty.
7152780	7154740	Uh, I got one more story for you guys.
7154740	7158500	Are you going to pick up Dante's Inferno by the way, just before I get to my thing?
7158500	7165780	No, because I have Borderlands and I now have Bioshock two to play and really I'll just
7165780	7167740	pick up God of War three.
7167740	7171900	Although Dante's Inferno looked kind of cool and you know, I'm, I'm interested just to
7171900	7177020	kind of play through it mindlessly, but not right away.
7177020	7181420	I'll wait for the maybe drop in price or, and Final Fantasy 13 is right around the corner.
7181420	7184380	So it's like, I really don't have time to play all these games.
7184380	7187620	It's just, it's just too many games.
7187620	7191020	I'll probably put it in the queue of things to play, like on my literal, now that I use
7191020	7195020	a rental game, so I stopped spending 60 bucks on games every week, uh, put it in my queue
7195020	7196020	of things to play.
7196020	7199500	But you know, one thing I'm learning, you don't always get what's number one on your
7199500	7200500	list right away.
7200500	7203660	It's not quite as effective as Netflix, just so you know.
7203660	7207340	Anyhow, uh, one other story for you guys, and this does have to do with spending money,
7207340	7212580	uh, buying stuff on your computer, uh, using one of those, uh, digital distribution sites.
7212580	7216460	You know, Steam, they are, uh, probably the kings of what's going on.
7216460	7223140	But there's some other websites that sell games too, and one of them is GOG.com, GOG.com,
7223140	7226020	or you might call them the good old games.
7226020	7229700	If you think about it, it's kind of a site that tries to legitimize abandonware.
7229700	7233500	If you've never heard of that term before, a lot of folks like to use some weird clause
7233500	7237100	in copyright law, which I think some dude just made up because he wanted to justify
7237100	7238100	the theft.
7238100	7242220	Um, is that if a game hasn't been published for seven years, then it's okay to send on
7242220	7243220	the internet wherever you want.
7243220	7244620	You can, uh, send that game out there.
7244620	7249620	Well, uh, obviously some publishers are not having that, uh, but GOG.com or good old games
7249620	7255940	tries to kind of legitimize that by selling DR free, DR, I'm sorry, DRM free old games.
7255940	7257900	And they got some big lands this week.
7257900	7263460	Um, they got a deal with Activision publishing to get some, uh, Sierra classics because Activision
7263460	7269060	has access to those classics now, uh, and that you can't even find on steam.
7269060	7272180	Some of those games, by the way, that are out right now, the first two that were added
7272180	7275860	are Canem of Steamworks and Magic Obscura.
7275860	7276860	Definitely an Obscura title.
7276860	7280460	Cause I haven't even heard of that one, but this one I definitely knew, Gabriel Knight
7280460	7281460	Sins of the Fathers.
7281460	7284940	I don't know if you ever heard of this game, but I've heard of the Gabriel Knight games.
7284940	7285940	Yeah.
7285940	7286940	It's pretty cool.
7286940	7288180	Cause Tim, Tim, Tim Curry does a voice in the game.
7288180	7292140	It was one of his voice acting gigs, six bucks for each one of those titles.
7292140	7295840	They are supposed to be doing like several titles a week over the next few months.
7295840	7299980	So a lot of these old school classic games, if you are curious and checking them out,
7299980	7302180	you can go to GOG.com.
7302180	7307680	Granted it's not the same as when that LucasArts pack was available for what, like nine bucks
7307680	7308680	or something.
7308680	7312860	Some obscenely low price on steam over the holidays, but, uh, you know, you can still
7312860	7318580	find some good old classic games because Loki doesn't have enough new games to play clearly.
7318580	7321860	So he should add some classic games to his, uh, buffet too.
7321860	7326780	I have plenty of games to play and I'm just trying to get through, I'm still trying to
7326780	7333140	sort my Maim ROM collection to eliminate all the crap I'm not going to use.
7333140	7337900	A lot of, several folks in chat chanting down with DRM, well that's one of their big things
7337900	7342140	is that they don't charge or they don't have really DRM on the games.
7342140	7344840	And so you can buy them and it's, you know, legitimate.
7344840	7348140	You can feel good karma and all that stuff and then not have to worry about the whole
7348140	7351940	abandonware and possibly getting viruses and all that stuff.
7351940	7354100	So there you go.
7354100	7357300	Anyhow that's going to do it for the news tonight and that's where we're going to go
7357300	7358580	to our Skype line.
7358580	7364220	It is now open 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
7364220	7368900	We are taking your calls live on this Sunday evening, Super Bowl Sunday, February the 7th
7368900	7369900	of 2010.
7369900	7373740	While we wait for some calls to come in, Loki's got some last minute stories for us.
7373740	7376260	Yes, uh, I do.
7376260	7379300	Well I just assume you usually do.
7379300	7382380	If you didn't, I guess I was wrong.
7382380	7387220	Uh, no, actually there's some other stuff we can talk about, um, of course I don't have
7387220	7389460	to pull it up yet because that would be really awesome.
7389460	7391380	Actually we'll talk about this real quick.
7391380	7395860	There's a game, Tales of Innocence, which was released on DS, um, in Japan.
7395860	7397580	You gotta reprieve, you gotta call.
7397580	7399460	Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
7399460	7402540	Hi, this is Spaznator.
7402540	7404540	Hi Spaznator, what's on your mind buddy?
7404540	7413180	Uh, two things, um, yeah, uh, I didn't know if you guys saw my tweets earlier in the week,
7413180	7420060	but, um, I thought it was kind of worth mentioning, uh, there's, uh, anime series that, uh, I
7420060	7422060	think you guys may want to check out.
7422060	7426620	I, before I can go back and check with Sakura into, uh, Anime as well.
7426620	7430180	Wait, hold that thought, hold that thought, because speaking of anime series, I, I totally
7430180	7433040	forgot to get into this at the top of the show and I wanted to.
7433040	7438380	This weekend I went to Japantown in, uh, San Francisco and I totally thought of Jamie,
7438380	7442780	because I, well, A, I saw the Taiyaki place that, um, I know she really loves and she
7442780	7445040	likes to eat there and it made me think of her.
7445040	7449040	And then we went to Japan video and some of those places and we were looking at, um, anime.
7449040	7452140	And I saw the Ragnarok anime on DVD.
7452140	7454660	I guess they made like 25 episodes of a Ragnarok anime.
7454660	7456700	Yeah, they have a whole season, it's actually pretty good.
7456700	7457700	I've watched most of it.
7457700	7458700	Have you?
7458700	7459700	Because it made me think of you.
7459700	7461380	I was like, I should get this for Jamie and then I'm thinking, no, she probably already
7461380	7462380	has it.
7462380	7466580	But actually I downloaded it when it first started coming out on TV and I never finished
7466580	7467580	it.
7467580	7468580	Oh, okay.
7468580	7469580	And so it actually won.
7469580	7471500	It was pretty cute, pretty, you know, close to the game.
7471500	7476500	I'm already getting the new DS one, the US one, um, cause I tried playing it in Japanese.
7476500	7477660	I tried.
7477660	7482300	But a completely, completely random tangent right next to all that stuff is a little store
7482300	7485420	called Pika Pika, which is a picture booth store.
7485420	7487860	It's one of the stores that's nothing but picture booths.
7487860	7491500	Now I met up in Japantown with a bunch of people that I play World of Warcraft with.
7491500	7493620	So it's like we had an IRL raid.
7493620	7497460	So we raided Pika Pika and one of the photo booths there and there was like six of us
7497460	7498460	in the photo booths.
7498460	7502620	Like it takes like $9 to take a picture, but it's all like green platforms you stand on
7502620	7504100	and it puts in backers.
7504100	7506540	We had so much picture club.
7506540	7508180	It was so much fun.
7508180	7511380	Like seriously, I think these only exist in big cities.
7511380	7513180	I've seen one by Arcade Infinity too.
7513180	7516660	There used to be one right next door there, but if you have one of these in your town,
7516660	7517660	it's a lot of fun.
7517660	7518660	Oh yeah, totally.
7518660	7519660	Okay.
7519660	7520660	Sorry.
7520660	7521660	What else do you want to talk about?
7521660	7522660	Uh, it's called Dumslinger Girl.
7522660	7532340	I don't know if either one of you have heard of it, but it's, uh, there's two, uh, seasons
7532340	7533340	of it.
7533340	7541380	Both are like 13 episodes long and the trick synopsis of it is, uh, you know, this government
7541380	7548700	agency over in, uh, really basically, uh, takes in, uh, you know, kids, they're basically
7548700	7558860	dying to, uh, $6 million, you know, women type cyborgs and, uh, has them, uh, do, uh,
7558860	7564140	assassinations for like, uh, assassinate terrorists and stuff like that.
7564140	7568100	So wait, Gunslinger, hold on, Gunslinger Girl was the name of the anime?
7568100	7569100	Yeah.
7569100	7570980	And you've, have you ever heard of this dark side?
7570980	7571980	Yes, I have.
7571980	7572980	I wanted to try it out.
7572980	7574780	It's just, you know, I haven't had a lot of time.
7574780	7577100	Is this something available on the PlayStation 3 marketplace?
7577100	7581660	Cause I know anime is like a big niche that they have on there that, uh, yes, it is.
7581660	7588220	Uh, there's, you know, season one and season two, and I think, uh, there's, uh, uh, I don't
7588220	7592300	want to call it a season three, but there is, uh, like another season there.
7592300	7597020	I think it's like, uh, like a reimagining of the entire series.
7597020	7601820	Uh, you want me when I call it like season 2.5, we were, if you want to call it that.
7601820	7602820	Okay.
7602820	7603820	Like a special, sure.
7603820	7611060	Yeah, but I have the entire season one and season two and I took very stuck season two
7611060	7616580	about a day and, oh my God, it's epic.
7616580	7622500	I mean, you know, it, you know, some always, you know, popping a video podcast kind of
7622500	7628220	like don't really like season two so much, but no, I love it personally.
7628220	7633140	So take that as you may, but you know, all in all it's pretty good.
7633140	7637140	We'll have to recommend that to the listeners and to the anime fans here in studio as well.
7637140	7638140	Gunslinger Girl.
7638140	7639140	Okay.
7639140	7640140	So sound really excited about that.
7640140	7642580	Anything else on the PlayStation network we should be checking out right now?
7642580	7643580	Uh, yeah.
7643580	7648540	Uh, it's something you kind of sort of touched on on your last show.
7648540	7655220	Uh, it's, uh, the new, uh, music guidance Sigma 2, uh, table for Zen Pinball.
7655220	7656220	Uh-huh.
7656220	7664300	I just stopped today and it's pretty good, uh, in fact, first of all, I think it's a
7664300	7668980	little bit better than some of the other tables that are currently available for the game.
7668980	7669980	I like Zen Pinball.
7669980	7671980	I'll have to check that out.
7671980	7672980	Yeah.
7672980	7673980	Yeah.
7673980	7676220	I'd definitely give her a thumbs up on that.
7676220	7677220	All right.
7677220	7681820	Well, uh, uh, let's get going so, uh, you can take more calls.
7681820	7682820	All right.
7682820	7683820	Yep.
7683820	7684820	Well, you have a good week, Spaznator.
7684820	7687540	Give me a phone call and we'll forgive you for the bad joke on Twitter earlier.
7687540	7688540	Okay.
7688540	7689540	All right.
7689540	7690540	You too, buddy.
7690540	7691540	Bye.
7691540	7692540	877 game.
7692540	7693540	OLRs.
7693540	7697540	The number to call her username on Skype is orange lounge radio.
7697540	7702780	Uh, by the way, taking a call from the East coast does remind me, uh, PAX East is probably
7702780	7703780	about what?
7703780	7704780	Six, seven weeks away.
7704780	7706020	Uh, PAX East is sold out.
7706020	7708020	So if you didn't get a ticket, you're out of luck.
7708020	7710220	Uh, I guess you maybe can still get a one day ticket.
7710220	7713060	Uh, and I'm going, I'm going to PAX East.
7713060	7715180	And I've like, really, I have tickets.
7715180	7717980	I, I actually just bought a regular ticket.
7717980	7722220	I decided I didn't want to do the media thing because a, PAX doesn't really do much for
7722220	7723220	media.
7723220	7724220	And that's fine.
7724220	7725220	I totally am cool with that.
7725220	7727700	And I think that's actually the way I wish E3 was that way.
7727700	7732500	Um, and so, you know, I just, I'm just, I'm going as a gamer, as a fan and you know, just
7732500	7736340	like the rest of you and, and don't really want to have to work through all of the packs.
7736340	7738320	So, uh, I'm just going to have fun.
7738320	7739460	So I'll be around at the show.
7739460	7740460	I'm going to try.
7740460	7745220	When the schedule comes out, I will try to find like a gaming lounge time, maybe with
7745220	7748060	the DS game I enjoy, uh, that I'll go be at.
7748060	7751660	And I'll let you guys know more about that when it gets a little closer to the show.
7751660	7752940	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7752940	7753940	Who's this?
7753940	7754940	Good day, sir.
7754940	7757220	This is Lieutenant South, tell me of USS Takahashi.
7757220	7759840	I'm pressing permission to come aboard.
7759840	7761980	Are you a Star Trek Online addict as well?
7761980	7764180	Yeah, I just picked it up last night.
7764180	7765180	It's Ron Matt, everyone.
7765180	7766180	Yes.
7766180	7767180	Hi, how you doing?
7767180	7769140	Sir, you getting the lag too?
7769140	7770140	Not really.
7770140	7774420	Because it's, I mean, I don't think it's my graphics card.
7774420	7779060	I think it's their servers, but I had to wait in the queue of 118 and it takes like five,
7779060	7781900	you know, five whole seconds to move in any direction.
7781900	7784100	I have not had that problem at all.
7784100	7787860	And mind you, my video card is like almost three years old.
7787860	7792260	Yeah, mine's actually just under what the correct one is supposed to be.
7792260	7796180	And, but it's seriously, they say they're supposed to be increasing server capacity,
7796180	7798380	but they haven't yet.
7798380	7799380	I don't know.
7799380	7802420	I just haven't had that problem at all.
7802420	7805940	It may also be the difference in locations that we're at too, because right now I've
7805940	7811060	been, I just hit memory alpha and my character's all like running all over the place and there's
7811060	7812060	a ton of people there.
7812060	7814600	So maybe it has to do with location too.
7814600	7815600	I believe so.
7815600	7819140	So is this what you called in to talk about tonight at Star Trek Online or?
7819140	7820540	Well, that too.
7820540	7821540	That too.
7821540	7826860	Um, first thing I want to talk about, something from a couple of podcasts in the, before you
7826860	7832820	mention about how it's possible for Steam to sell so many games at dirt cheap prices.
7832820	7833820	Yes.
7833820	7835620	I believe I have the answer for that.
7835620	7836620	Please.
7836620	7837620	Okay.
7837620	7841380	I used to work in a video store and we would rent games, so on and so forth.
7841380	7846220	Once the rental of the game got to a certain point, we could sell it at a price because
7846220	7850240	all the rentals made the money back on the purchase of the game.
7850240	7854680	My thing is with Steam, once they have this game, they sell it at that price.
7854680	7858980	Once they've made the money back on selling the game, they can just cut the price to as
7858980	7863440	cheap as they want and that shares extra cash for them.
7863440	7867300	But I would still think that the deals are based on percentages of sales.
7867300	7871060	That seems kind of odd that, you know, that it would work based on, you know, how much
7871060	7873380	of it sells, I guess.
7873380	7874380	I get what you're saying.
7874380	7875380	It makes sense.
7875380	7876380	But I don't know.
7876380	7880940	I think maybe the whole like retail strategy to digital distribution seems a little apples
7880940	7881940	to oranges.
7881940	7882940	I mean, you could be right though.
7882940	7889300	I mean, because when we rent these games, like there was one game, you know, we have
7889300	7895100	like five copies of Mortal Kombat, three of them will be selling for like $30 and two
7895100	7901060	will be selling for, I'd say, $40 because of the rental turnaround rate on those games.
7901060	7907020	I mean, if they get a game, they sell at this price, they make the money back off of, you
7907020	7912300	know, the licensing, the rights, the time it costs to be invested into it, and there
7912300	7913300	you go.
7913300	7916660	Well, I was also just the mindset, I mean, honestly, I always still kind of think the
7916660	7920180	reason for the sale is that, you know, assuming it is based off percentages, those companies
7920180	7925300	are still making $5 off a game they would have made no dollars off of had it not been
7925300	7926860	on Steam on a huge sale.
7926860	7930060	You know, some money is better than no money, a long forgotten game that got booted off
7930060	7931980	of shelves years ago.
7931980	7933660	So I don't know.
7933660	7934660	Good thought though.
7934660	7935660	I mean, anything is possible.
7935660	7939200	And unfortunately, until we know somebody on the inside at Steam that knows the agreements
7939200	7941300	of the arrangements, we just won't know.
7941300	7944260	Yeah, but we can go off of that for the time being.
7944260	7945260	All right.
7945260	7946260	Fine.
7946260	7947260	Anything else?
7947260	7951460	I just want to say thanks for listening, for taking the chance to listen to my podcast
7951460	7952460	over the weekend.
7952460	7956100	I have to admit I downloaded it, but I didn't listen to it yet, but I will.
7956100	7957520	That's fine, that's fine.
7957520	7963540	And if you're looking for good titles, I recommend Kidu Tenshi Angelic Layer.
7963540	7966020	It's free on Netflix right now.
7966020	7970700	What are some good animes based off of video games?
7970700	7972660	Remember Tower Jiraga, that old video game?
7972660	7973900	I do.
7973900	7974900	That's become an anime.
7974900	7975900	I believe it's been licensed.
7975900	7976900	Interesting.
7976900	7979660	Well, they had kind of a renaissance of that game a while ago, too.
7979660	7981500	There's a new Jiraga game, I think, on PS2.
7981500	7982500	That makes sense.
7982500	7983500	Yeah.
7983500	7984500	Very interesting.
7984500	7985940	One other quick question I have for you.
7985940	7990580	A movie I saw at the video store that looked hilarious, and I don't know, maybe Jamie knows
7990580	7991580	of this, too.
7991580	7992580	Apparently, it was a...
7992580	7995640	And I can't remember the name of it, but apparently it was a Japanese movie directed by the same
7995640	8001980	guy who did Ichi the Killer, and it was advertised as, um, The Sound of Music meets Dawn of the
8001980	8002980	Dead.
8002980	8008340	That, I don't know, but I believe the director was Takahashi Mike or Miike.
8008340	8013380	It looked hilarious from the box art, and I was wondering before I go out and either
8013380	8017900	spend money on that or obtain it through questionable means, if it was worth my time.
8017900	8024660	Um, anything along those lines of Ichi the Killer, I keep hearing is well worth the purchase.
8024660	8030780	I'm actually using a website I should have used a long time ago and looking up Ichi the
8030780	8031780	Killer on...
8031780	8034060	The Hills Are Alive with Sound?
8034060	8036200	It has another name to it, though.
8036200	8039100	That's like the little tagline, I think, to the...
8039100	8040100	It's, um...
8040100	8042860	The Family Something was the name of it.
8042860	8045140	The Happiness of the Katakris?
8045140	8047060	Yes, that's it.
8047060	8049900	That's the name of it.
8049900	8051020	That I've not heard of.
8051020	8053580	The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Screaming?
8053580	8056340	The Sound of Music Meets Stone of the Dead.
8056340	8057340	That was it.
8057340	8058340	That was the box I saw.
8058340	8061040	It's awesome because it does look exactly like, uh...
8061040	8062460	It made me lol for real.
8062460	8064140	Alright, that'd be awesome.
8064140	8067500	Alright, well maybe somebody else will call in later and tell me about that.
8067500	8070020	Alright, Ramo, we're gonna let you go so we can get more calls, but thank you as always,
8070020	8071460	and hey, have fun on Star Trek, okay?
8071460	8072460	I will.
8072460	8073460	Calm out.
8073460	8074460	1-877-GAMEL-OR.
8074460	8082460	At first I was like, was that a Seacrest Out thing?
8082460	8085140	But no, I forgot they do that in Star Trek.
8085140	8086140	1-877-GAMEL-OR.
8086140	8088300	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8088300	8090700	We'll take maybe one more call, I don't know.
8090700	8091700	We'll see how it goes.
8091700	8095140	Uh, Loki, I keep cutting you off, but we'll see how far we can get before we get another...
8095140	8096140	Oh, never mind.
8096140	8097140	We got another call.
8097140	8098140	I know.
8098140	8099140	You can try.
8099140	8100140	Psych!
8100140	8101140	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
8101140	8102140	Who's this?
8102140	8103260	Uh, it's the one and only Legend of Zaku.
8103260	8105500	Well, how are you doing, Legend of Zaku?
8105500	8108620	Recovering from almost a hangover this morning.
8108620	8109620	Nice.
8109620	8110980	Were you drinking before noon?
8110980	8111980	What's going on?
8111980	8114060	No, it was basically last night's drinking.
8114060	8115060	Oh, I see.
8115060	8121940	Um, let's just say that I drank to the point where I, I drank into places where, into a,
8121940	8122940	into a boundary.
8122940	8123940	Okay, okay.
8123940	8125940	You've got to stop, stop typing during the show.
8125940	8126940	Seriously.
8126940	8127940	You can't type right now.
8127940	8128940	Go ahead.
8128940	8129940	All right.
8129940	8134220	But yeah, I just wanted to bring up that whole, that whole harmonic speculation about, you
8134220	8135220	know, the licenses.
8135220	8136220	Oh yes, please.
8136220	8141860	Um, basically, the way I see it is that Konami, the only thing they have going for them right
8141860	8144320	now is lawyers.
8144320	8149980	In other words, they sued Roxer over ITG and they managed to win that case single-handedly
8149980	8152100	and, and got their franchise.
8152100	8154220	Because it was a complete rip-off of DDR.
8154220	8156220	I, I hate to say it, but they had a right.
8156220	8159540	And you could probably say the same thing for whatever Harmonics is doing with whatever
8159540	8162340	they, we think they're doing with the, with those licenses.
8162340	8166820	Right, it's going to be a rip-off of Beatmania because that's exactly what DJ Hero was, except
8166820	8167920	it wasn't.
8167920	8172460	And so, you know, really, I think with a DJ game, assuming that's what they're doing,
8172460	8173780	we don't even know what the hell they're doing.
8173780	8176780	They could be doing, you know, Rockman stuff.
8176780	8177780	I mean, who knows?
8177780	8178780	Exactly.
8178780	8182380	I mean, Harmonics still has, uh, amplitude and frequency.
8182380	8187740	Where did, didn't that make them famous before, before the whole, the whole Rockman thing?
8187740	8191660	Harmonics was also not sued over Guitar Hero because the look and feel from Guitar Freaks
8191660	8193060	was completely different.
8193060	8196940	Whereas with IT in the groove, it, the look and feel was the exact same as DDR.
8196940	8201200	I mean, right on down to the backgrounds and animations and, and pretty much the way the
8201200	8202200	arrows looked.
8202200	8203200	They added mines.
8203200	8204200	Woo!
8204200	8205200	You know what I mean?
8205200	8209460	Well, we also have to keep in mind that, uh, I mean, you could have said the same thing
8209460	8210460	for Pump It Up.
8210460	8213460	Wasn't that almost a rip-off of DDR with those arrows?
8213460	8219420	I think though that went back, I want to say Konami and Amiro made an agreement many years
8219420	8223340	ago because Pump It Up was actually first.
8223340	8225660	But anyhow, I don't want to rehash that old news.
8225660	8226660	I get it though.
8226660	8227660	Okay.
8227660	8230300	So, so the lawyers in, in litigation is how Konami keeps their franchises going.
8230300	8234780	Well, that all depends on how, how, you know, how harmonics is actually going to approach
8234780	8239500	this, whether or not they're actually going to reinvent the same four panel dance, dance
8239500	8244580	paradigm that we've seen for, for more than a decade or they're going to go into a new
8244580	8245580	direction.
8245580	8250980	Chances are, you know, if I was a betting man, I would say, I would say the latter just
8250980	8255900	because they're pretty good at innovating, pretty good at innovating within, you know,
8255900	8256900	within rhythm.
8256900	8260740	You know, and all, here's the thing though, all of this is speculation though.
8260740	8265700	I mean, they could be licensing these songs for rock band for some weird little pop expansion
8265700	8266700	they're doing.
8266700	8267700	We don't know.
8267700	8268700	You know, it could be nothing.
8268700	8272540	I don't see those songs in particular being something that, that would blend well with
8272540	8275380	rock band, you know, completely.
8275380	8278780	The way I see it is that they're going to do something, they're, they're doing something
8278780	8281500	outside of rock band with that.
8281500	8285620	Or rock band three is, is something we haven't thought of yet.
8285620	8289980	I think PAX East is probably going to give us some clues because, you know, Harmonics
8289980	8292140	is a huge, Harmonics is in Boston.
8292140	8293720	This is happening in their backyard.
8293720	8296620	So this is the perfect place for them to make an announcement.
8296620	8300660	I think Harmonics is the kind of company that will drop a bomb at PAX East.
8300660	8306780	See, I would love to, to go and see it for myself, but since I was, since I was unemployed
8306780	8312920	and up until last week, there was no way, there was no way I would have gotten tickets
8312920	8314340	well in advance.
8314340	8318100	Well congratulations on, uh, getting employment though, that's, that's good news, all things
8318100	8319100	considered.
8319100	8320100	Right.
8320100	8326260	But I guess, I guess time will tell to, you know, on what's going to happen, whether or
8326260	8328340	not they make good use of those licenses.
8328340	8329340	Exactly.
8329340	8333260	And keep in mind, I will be, you know, whatever Harmonics puts out, if they do bring it to
8333260	8338060	PAX East and I get a chance to get my grubby little hands on it, I will give it my critical
8338060	8341580	eye with my music games background and I'll, I'll let y'all know.
8341580	8342580	Right.
8342580	8343580	Of course.
8343580	8347460	Just try to make sure you don't want to, don't give them the benefit of the doubt.
8347460	8352740	Try to, well try to like, uh, you know, add, press them on some hard questions, obviously
8352740	8358140	not, you know, not treading into NDA stuff, but, but just try to like, challenge them
8358140	8362700	that they, that they're trying to sell you on something that's, that you think is not
8362700	8364580	going to be revolutionary.
8364580	8365580	I'll do my best.
8365580	8369700	All right, Zaku, uh, any other thoughts here before we, uh, let you go?
8369700	8374500	Um, don't, don't drink a 40 ounce of liquor because all it, all that's going to do is
8374500	8377420	create, all it's going to do is purge your stomach.
8377420	8379420	It happened to me last night.
8379420	8380420	Some sage advice.
8380420	8382060	Have a good one, Zaku.
8382060	8383060	Right.
8383060	8384060	Later.
8384060	8388180	We'll go ahead and take one more call if someone wants to call in 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username
8388180	8389900	on Skype is ORANGELOUNGERADIO.
8389900	8391940	Loki, anything to tide us over?
8391940	8395300	250 gigabyte hard drives coming out in Japan in March.
8395300	8396300	Yay.
8396300	8398300	Probably over here eventually.
8398300	8401780	Uh, here's a good one.
8401780	8406540	Sonic the Hedgehog is rumored to be playable in Mario Galaxy 2.
8406540	8409300	Kind of going back to what we were talking about in part A.
8409300	8412700	Where if Sonic the Hedgehog 4 fails, then Sonic will just be a Nintendo character.
8412700	8413700	There you go.
8413700	8414700	There you go.
8414700	8421620	Uh, let's see, there's a Dish Network channel that's going to be dedicated to Tetris.
8421620	8422620	You can play it on your TV.
8422620	8426140	Didn't that come up a few weeks ago, or maybe that was the show that didn't happen, I don't
8426140	8427140	remember.
8427140	8428140	I don't remember.
8428140	8429140	I don't remember something about...
8429140	8432140	No, there was a new Tetris game in development, but it wasn't, it's not the Dish Network thing,
8432140	8435740	it was something about somebody was making a new Tetris.
8435740	8437660	I wonder if the two are related.
8437660	8438660	I don't know.
8438660	8439660	Possibly.
8439660	8440660	It's going to cost you $2.99 a month.
8440660	8443900	Really, just play it free online, you don't need to play it on your TV.
8443900	8446660	Play it on anything else.
8446660	8447660	Anything else.
8447660	8454460	Um, according to Game Informer, and I got my magazine today, LA Noire is no longer a
8454460	8455460	PS3 exclusive.
8455460	8459180	Oh, it's hitting the Xbox 360 as well.
8459180	8461940	Ugh, another one, lost.
8461940	8463900	That's too bad.
8463900	8468500	That would be pretty cool, whenever the hell it comes out.
8468500	8469500	Long ways away.
8469500	8473780	Speaking of something else that's not an exclusive anymore, High Voltage was bringing a brand
8473780	8477740	new game, The Grinder, which is going to be a supernatural first person shooter game,
8477740	8482460	originally going to be a Wii exclusive, however now it's coming to Xbox 360, PlayStation 3,
8482460	8483940	and PC as well.
8483940	8487220	And it will probably look way better than the Wii version anyways.
8487220	8492140	Last call, by the way, for phone calls, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is orange-lantredio,
8492140	8495140	if you want to call into the show, it's an empty line right now, Super Bowl Sunday's
8495140	8496940	a good day when everybody's distracted.
8496940	8503380	And Cracked In 2 had a contest to have fans submit user-made graffiti.
8503380	8511620	And one of the pictures that got, I guess, won, was of these two male agents making out.
8511620	8514340	Which is pretty awesome.
8514340	8515900	Interesting.
8515900	8517220	Huh.
8517220	8523620	I, okay, whatever, hey.
8523620	8524620	That's all I have.
8524620	8525620	That's it.
8525620	8526620	Alright.
8526620	8532140	I, oh, we just in the nick of time got another call, let's take this and then we'll wrap
8532140	8533140	it all up.
8533140	8536620	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
8536620	8537620	Hey, this is X-Link.
8537620	8539860	Hey, X-Link, what's on your mind, buddy?
8539860	8544340	Hey, I'm glad to, I was reading Kotaku earlier on today and realized that they're coming
8544340	8547780	out with a new version of Blaster Master come tomorrow, everywhere.
8547780	8550020	I know, well, did you listen to Part A tonight?
8550020	8556940	We had a joygasm over it in Part A. Oh, did you, I'm sorry, I was having, we were having
8556940	8557940	some issues.
8557940	8558940	Yeah, we know, Super Bowl, blah, blah, blah.
8558940	8562660	No, no, no, no, nothing with Super Bowl at all, it was with the step-kids.
8562660	8564660	Alright, well, okay, fair enough.
8564660	8567300	What is on your mind, though, at least about the Blaster Master game, what are your thoughts
8567300	8568300	on it?
8568300	8573660	I'm going to think, I looked over the video they had out on YouTube and I, yeah, I gazzled
8573660	8579460	myself pretty much because this was one of the first games I got back when I had my NES
8579460	8582660	and I buy it with my own money and I absolutely loved it.
8582660	8585980	In fact, I had the World of Power book.
8585980	8586980	It was so good.
8586980	8589180	Oh, those novels by, like, FX9 and stuff?
8589180	8590180	Yes, yes, I have a bunch of them.
8590180	8592020	Fuck yes, I had that one, too.
8592020	8593700	And the Simon's Quest book, both were epic.
8593700	8596540	I think I had the Metal Gear one, too.
8596540	8599940	Yeah, I was missing this, too, because a lot of my books were burnt down, a lot of my old
8599940	8605820	school stuff for the games that I had, my PS1 games, a lot of those, I had back in my
8605820	8612420	mom's apartment when I was going from Orlando, Florida to Melbourne, Florida, a lot of stuff
8612420	8613420	got burnt down.
8613420	8616500	There was an arson in my mom's apartment and a lot of that stuff got burnt down, so I had
8616500	8622660	to go online and re-find the books, which, a lot of books I got, but the Simon's Quest
8622660	8626740	and the Metal Gear are, if you have them in good condition, are really valuable and really
8626740	8627740	hard to find.
8627740	8630060	A lot of the text, though, at least, is available online.
8630060	8631700	You can read a lot of those novels online.
8631700	8632700	Yeah.
8632700	8636460	Yeah, it's not the same thing, you know, collectors and all that, but I do, just, like, complete
8636460	8639460	random-ass fact about those books, and for those that don't know what we're talking about,
8639460	8644240	the World of Power were these books that they wrote about old NES games, but since a lot
8644240	8648340	of the 8-bit video games didn't really have stories that made for very good books, a lot
8648340	8652340	of times the authors would kind of add their own stuff to it, like, for instance, I believe
8652340	8657460	the plot about Castlevania 2 had to do with some kid, like, warping himself into that
8657460	8658460	world.
8658460	8660300	Like, it wasn't even really about Simon Belmont, but somebody-
8660300	8661620	To no end the Game Master.
8661620	8662620	Rip-off!
8662620	8663980	His little sidekick.
8663980	8668100	But there were some extra characters in Blaster Master to make that story work, too, and here's
8668100	8669300	the interesting thing.
8669300	8673700	I believe one of the characters was Eve, which was, I think, like, the name of the car or
8673700	8675900	something, or, like, was one of the robot characters.
8675900	8681740	They actually, the programmers of Blaster Master, made Eve, they wrote her into the
8681740	8685420	official canon, and she was in the Game Boy game.
8685420	8687700	And it's also from part two, from what I understand.
8687700	8691460	I believe there was an actual part two for Blaster Master, and they brought the actual
8691460	8693340	plot line from the book into the game.
8693340	8697620	I think that was kind of neat, so, because Blaster Master was one of the better books.
8697620	8704260	And also, the covers, a lot of times the covers were different from the actual game covers
8704260	8705260	from the video game.
8705260	8708980	That's right, because they took out, like, the gun from the Metal Gear cover, and they,
8708980	8709980	yeah, I remember that.
8709980	8710980	I remember that.
8710980	8711980	I remember that one.
8711980	8712980	Yeah, so.
8712980	8715580	But the kids' book, I mean, come on.
8715580	8719820	Good times down memory lane, good times.
8719820	8722740	They need to bring back those books, although I guess they do have them to some extent.
8722740	8726100	Like, there's books about Halo, tons of books about World of Warcraft.
8726100	8728300	Well, they're always bringing back, like, the Chijo Adventures.
8728300	8729580	I couldn't see why they couldn't do it.
8729580	8734980	I mean, you know, get the permission from the people and, you know, redo it, I mean.
8734980	8737740	All right.
8737740	8740900	But no, I was just mostly, I know you guys, you were looking for some calls, so it's called
8740900	8741900	about that.
8741900	8744620	And I was the guy really giddy about that, because I, you know, I had a lot of my old
8744620	8747780	school games, you know, like Blaster Master, you know, it was one of the first ones.
8747780	8749740	Of course, Castlevania was in there, I want to.
8749740	8751740	Castlevania II, I remember spending hours on it.
8751740	8752740	I'm giddy, too.
8752740	8753740	I wish it was on PS3.
8753740	8758860	Always burning out my friends, Nintendo, NES, because we had it on for 18 hours straight
8758860	8761180	because we didn't want to turn it off, and, you know, we wanted to go through and beat
8761180	8763780	the game, so.
8763780	8768180	I'm excited, but I'm trying very hard not to get too excited that I don't want to set
8768180	8772500	the expectations too high for this game, I'm just going to set the bar, like, somewhere
8772500	8773500	in the middle.
8773500	8776020	Because, you know, I don't want to get too excited and then be disappointed, you know
8776020	8777020	what I mean?
8777020	8778020	No, I hear you.
8778020	8779020	I hear you.
8779020	8781020	I'd be one of those things, like, you get all gung-ho about it, and it's like, ah, man,
8781020	8782820	when the heck did I do this in the first place?
8782820	8783820	Exactly.
8783820	8786340	All right, well, X-Link, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank
8786340	8789320	you so much for the call, and, you know what, actually, when you called, like, about two
8789320	8792500	other people called in at the same time, so you lucked out, so congrats.
8792500	8793500	No problem.
8793500	8794500	Thanks, man.
8794500	8795500	I appreciate it.
8795500	8798220	All right, that is going to do it for the Skypline tonight, and I apologize to those
8798220	8802780	folks that didn't get through, but if you do want to still interact with the show, remember,
8802780	8807900	we do take Twitter topics every week, we do take emails every week, you know what, any
8807900	8811460	way you can figure out on the internet on all of our various websites to contact us,
8811460	8815980	we will probably consider reading it on the show if you find us on one of those many,
8815980	8816980	many websites.
8816980	8820100	I'm going to go ahead and let Loki finish up any last minute stories he has while we
8820100	8821580	go ahead and shut down the Skypline.
8821580	8823620	This is kind of old news, I guess.
8823620	8826380	I've never heard of it, so I'm going to mention it.
8826380	8833220	Apparently there is a fan project, I guess an independent game, if you will, that is
8833220	8844740	called Terrordrome, and basically it's a fighting game featuring only horror movie characters.
8844740	8846860	I've not heard of this either, interesting.
8846860	8856860	So you've got Freddy, you've got Jason from the Friday the 13th movies, you actually have
8856860	8864260	Ash in there as well, Chucky, lots of cool characters, oh here's the full list, oh it's
8864260	8869260	under construction, thank you, but they do have a demo available online, I guess, that
8869260	8877860	you can download, it's awesome, and I'll have to check that out.
8877860	8886060	But if you want to check it out, it's at Terrordrome-thegame.com.
8886060	8887060	That's it.
8887060	8888060	Alright.
8888060	8892660	I had to link something in the chat room that has nothing to do with video games.
8892660	8895780	But you thought you'd link it anyway, it's all good, what is it?
8895780	8898580	Come have a look, it's actually this right here.
8898580	8905780	I'm a big type nerd, and I like that there's this garage where they actually manage to
8905780	8910660	get it, where if you're looking right from a certain angle, everything is perfectly aligned.
8910660	8913920	But as you go through, you see they've actually painted it all the way across.
8913920	8917020	That is pretty nerdy, I gotta say.
8917020	8918700	It's one of those optical illusions.
8918700	8923700	But also, when I look at games, I've actually been paying more attention to how they're
8923700	8928540	designed, you know, the look and feel of them, and I think that has a lot to do with that.
8928540	8930980	You know, you have to know your way around everything.
8930980	8931980	Alright.
8931980	8935980	Uh, Loki, I still see you playing on the YouTube there, did you get your thing fixed, or what
8935980	8936980	did you do?
8936980	8939660	Um, I argued saying that it was under fair use.
8939660	8942420	Oh, and it, the audio's back!
8942420	8943420	Nice.
8943420	8947460	Oh, look at that, see, arguing works.
8947460	8949260	I hope you don't get our account closed.
8949260	8950260	No, yeah.
8950260	8955380	So anyways, the new video that I posted online is now working, so if you want to go check
8955380	8959780	it out, please do it quickly, because I don't know how long they'll leave it up there.
8959780	8963060	And next week, next week we may not have an Orange Lounge Radio YouTube account, so enjoy
8963060	8964060	it while it lasts.
8964060	8965060	Who gives a crap?
8965060	8966060	We'll make a new one.
8966060	8967060	Alright.
8967060	8968060	But yes, check it out now!
8968060	8969060	Cool.
8969060	8972620	Uh, I have a quick last minute, sort of like, update.
8972620	8978940	Every year at Orange Lounge Radio, our friends over at Understation Live do their March Madness,
8978940	8982940	but now they call it, I think they just call it, uh, USL Madness, because it doesn't always
8982940	8987860	happen in March, but all the, you might remember a few weeks ago, we got some phone calls,
8987860	8992460	they were collecting the top 25 games, well they compiled that and they got the first
8992460	8993980	brackets up.
8993980	8997300	So some of the games are now doing battle, so if you want to check that out, go to Orange
8997300	9002100	Lounge Radio, and go to our forums, and you'll see there's a whole forum for March Madness,
9002100	9005300	and it says 2009 because we can't figure out how to update it, but it actually is all the
9005300	9010380	posts for 2010, and you can see all the brackets, and you can vote in the first round, but voting
9010380	9012860	closes tomorrow night, Monday night.
9012860	9015700	So you can choose, like, for instance, I'll read a few of these matchups that are going
9015700	9022900	on right now, Civilization versus Time Crisis, which is better, uh, Halo 2 versus Para Para
9022900	9030640	Paradise, Contra versus Final Fantasy X, and one of my favorites, Final Fantasy versus
9030640	9034480	Final Fantasy VIII, that's right, it just so happened the two Final Fantasies are doing
9034480	9038380	battle for each other, and when I voted Final Fantasy VIII was winning and I was pissed,
9038380	9042460	I was like, how can people vote for Craptacular VIII over the original?
9042460	9046380	I don't get it, but Final Fantasy I is currently winning and I feel much better.
9046380	9049100	So there you go, go check that out, but that's only going to be good till Monday night, so
9049100	9053940	if you're listening on the podcast, it might be too late, but you can go vote in the next
9053940	9061020	round and have your voice heard on what is truly the best video game of all time, according
9061020	9063100	to the OLR network.
9063100	9066780	Alright, um, that's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio, I know we're
9066780	9070420	done a little bit early tonight, but, um, that's the way it goes sometimes, sometimes
9070420	9073180	we have a lot to say, sometimes we don't have as much to say, so we're going to wrap it
9073180	9075940	all up and get on out of here for the night.
9075940	9080060	But first, we gotta go around and get everybody's final thought, and I'll start with my final
9080060	9081060	thought tonight.
9081060	9084420	My final thought is, I should, like, go to the arcade or something, play some arcade
9084420	9085420	games, that would be fun.
9085420	9086420	I haven't been in a while.
9086420	9087420	That sounds like fun.
9087420	9088420	It does sound like fun.
9088420	9089420	Maybe after moving.
9089420	9090940	Uh, DarkSakurai, your final thought?
9090940	9092860	Typography is life.
9092860	9094220	And Loki, your final thought?
9094220	9098300	It's really funny how- Your mic's off.
9098300	9103460	It's really funny how my mic was off, um, no, that, uh, just a simple little, uh, instructional
9103460	9110540	guide on eHow can get your YouTube video back up even though it has copyright music in it.
9110540	9114340	Let's hope it's there next week, we'll see, but, uh, one thing I hope to see next week
9114340	9115340	is all of you.
9115340	9118620	Uh, thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting.
9118620	9122780	Hey, if you like what you heard, all we ask, tell a couple friends about the show, tell
9122780	9126000	a couple enemies about the show if you want, just tell people about the show, help us with
9126000	9128220	word of mouth because that is the only way we get to promote.
9128220	9132060	We don't have a multimillion dollar website or magazine or video game company behind us.
9132060	9134260	We are all about the independent word of mouth.
9134260	9137460	That's how we've been kept empowered over the past eight years that we've been doing
9137460	9138460	this show.
9138460	9139460	Whew.
9139460	9141260	All right, we'll be back to do it all again next week.
9141260	9142820	It is Valentine's Day.
9142820	9144660	Who knows what's going to happen next week.
9144660	9145660	So, uh, tune in.
9145660	9149460	Until then, uh, that does it for another week here at Orange Lounge Studios.
9149460	9150460	Have a great week.
9150460	9157460	We'll be back next Sunday for more of Orange Lounge Radio.
9180460	9181460	Right anyway.
9181460	9210460	See you next week.
