00:13.837 --> 00:24.695
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, February 14th, 2010, the X10 event brings us a barrage of Xbox news, you'll see less Guitar Hero in 2010, and what new video game is getting a movie screenplay written for it?

00:31.078 --> 00:35.402
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello everybody out there and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:35.482 --> 00:38.805
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:38.885 --> 00:39.986
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rob Roberts.

00:40.387 --> 00:45.972
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be talking to you over the next few hours here live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

00:46.012 --> 00:49.975
[SPEAKER_06]: Joining me as she does every week, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura.

00:51.377 --> 00:52.818
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.

00:53.278 --> 00:55.380
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate that noise more than anything, you know that, right?

00:55.420 --> 00:56.161
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that noise.

00:56.181 --> 00:57.042
[SPEAKER_06]: You do that just to make me mad.

00:57.442 --> 00:59.544
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, just so you know, Jamie's a little sick tonight.

01:00.505 --> 01:01.066
[SPEAKER_02]: In the head.

01:01.486 --> 01:04.209
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's a given, that's always, that's like your thing.

01:04.589 --> 01:06.171
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had the crap.

01:06.451 --> 01:10.315
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, but you're not like coughing and sounding plaguey, you just, your voice is a little eh.

01:10.796 --> 01:11.816
[SPEAKER_02]: TechMasterLoki TechMasterLoki

01:39.949 --> 01:41.871
[SPEAKER_07]: The Difference Between Crocheting and Knitting

02:01.972 --> 02:02.673
[SPEAKER_06]: Not this, Rob.

02:02.833 --> 02:03.694
[SPEAKER_06]: You're making me a scarf.

02:03.734 --> 02:04.054
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a scarf.

02:04.074 --> 02:05.495
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making you the gayest scarf ever.

02:05.555 --> 02:07.057
[SPEAKER_06]: I want a Rainbow Doctor Who scarf.

02:07.077 --> 02:07.897
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I asked for.

02:07.917 --> 02:08.398
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be fun.

02:08.758 --> 02:08.998
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:09.038 --> 02:09.259
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

02:09.339 --> 02:09.719
[SPEAKER_06]: Who cares?

02:10.580 --> 02:16.885
[SPEAKER_06]: We're here, of course, every week, live Sunday nights, 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show, live at All Games Radio.

02:16.925 --> 02:19.668
[SPEAKER_06]: Big thanks to them for letting us steal their bandwidth every week.

02:19.728 --> 02:22.330
[SPEAKER_06]: It's www.allgames.com.

02:22.370 --> 02:27.535
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to check out our own website and our show archives, you can head over to www.orangeloungeradio.com.

02:28.215 --> 02:31.718
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight we're going to start off the show as we always do with a little bit of how was your gaming week.

02:32.578 --> 02:35.360
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, I know her voice is kind of bugging her.

02:35.661 --> 02:38.002
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go to her anyway and ask how our gaming week was.

02:38.443 --> 02:39.684
[SPEAKER_06]: Or better yet, you know what?

02:39.904 --> 02:40.744
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet I could guess.

02:41.205 --> 02:43.706
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to do my impersonation of DarkSakura's gaming week.

02:43.887 --> 02:44.207
[SPEAKER_06]: You ready?

02:44.767 --> 02:44.967
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

02:46.368 --> 02:51.710
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, first off, I played Star Trek online, and I saw some Borg, and it was cool.

02:52.110 --> 02:53.331
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't find any Borg.

02:53.411 --> 02:54.231
[SPEAKER_11]: I fought the Gorn.

02:54.371 --> 02:59.933
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I watched my husband play a first-person shooter, but it made me sick, so I decided to play Peggle.

03:00.353 --> 03:00.854
[SPEAKER_03]: Peggle!

03:01.094 --> 03:02.694
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I haven't played any Peggle.

03:03.515 --> 03:05.335
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought that was pretty good, Loki.

03:05.355 --> 03:09.197
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do you sound like Clarence from Wonder Shows Him?

03:09.337 --> 03:09.697
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

03:13.869 --> 03:15.250
[SPEAKER_02]: I did play Star Trek Online.

03:15.270 --> 03:15.910
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course you did.

03:15.930 --> 03:18.051
[SPEAKER_02]: I did shoot the Gorn, not the Borg.

03:18.091 --> 03:19.292
[SPEAKER_02]: The Gorn are the lizard people.

03:19.452 --> 03:19.632
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

03:20.172 --> 03:22.633
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was excellent.

03:24.054 --> 03:27.575
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I played Solitaire on my iPhone.

03:27.595 --> 03:28.456
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not play Peggle.

03:28.556 --> 03:31.057
[SPEAKER_02]: I found a Flash version of Bust a Move.

03:32.137 --> 03:33.098
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Puzzle Bobble.

03:34.420 --> 03:38.562
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we got out some obscure game system from the vault and hooked it up and played it.

03:38.582 --> 03:43.445
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we played Chrono Trigger on the Super Nintendo.

03:44.006 --> 03:45.587
[SPEAKER_11]: And Dan was playing Ninja Gaiden 3.

03:47.688 --> 03:50.249
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we have the Ninja Gaiden trilogy on the SNES.

03:51.190 --> 03:51.490
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

03:51.650 --> 03:53.091
[SPEAKER_06]: How dare I say an obscure game?

03:54.512 --> 03:54.772
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob.

03:55.292 --> 03:55.512
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

03:57.453 --> 03:58.034
[SPEAKER_06]: Love you, mean it.

04:00.055 --> 04:01.776
[SPEAKER_02]: You did bring me coffee, so I forgive you.

04:02.076 --> 04:03.597
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to try and do my gaming week?

04:04.346 --> 04:05.307
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to try and do my Gaming Week?

04:05.567 --> 04:06.127
Well!

04:07.208 --> 04:08.269
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty close, pretty close.

04:08.569 --> 04:09.630
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to Loki next, though.

04:09.670 --> 04:10.611
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your Gaming Week, Loki?

04:11.331 --> 04:13.973
[SPEAKER_07]: I just played lots of Grand Theft Auto.

04:15.414 --> 04:16.115
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, it was funny.

04:16.335 --> 04:21.458
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't run into him, but my coworkers ran into somebody that was actually cheating.

04:22.379 --> 04:27.800
[SPEAKER_07]: Their console modded in a modded version of the game and they were cheating that way.

04:28.420 --> 04:34.122
[SPEAKER_07]: Granted, we could do that again, but I just don't want to have to have all these banned consoles sitting around.

04:35.222 --> 04:40.103
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, can I just say in chat, of course, I haven't given them a shout out yet, but we always welcome our chatters every week.

04:40.183 --> 04:43.804
[SPEAKER_06]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to join us live on this Sunday evening.

04:44.144 --> 04:46.705
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're listening via the podcast, there's other ways you can interact with us.

04:46.905 --> 04:48.025
[SPEAKER_06]: Our Twitter feed at OLR.

04:48.405 --> 05:02.059
[SPEAKER_06]: Our Facebook at Orange Lounge Radio Or of course our mailbag Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com VidPower is live in our chat tonight and says Do Loki next Play GTA 4 then worked on Arcade Cabinet That would be the Loki impersonation No, that's about right

05:04.522 --> 05:07.504
[SPEAKER_07]: No, so we... I watched him play, this guy.

05:07.905 --> 05:09.746
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, it was just stupid.

05:09.786 --> 05:11.328
[SPEAKER_07]: But still winning.

05:11.608 --> 05:18.273
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually, I think I'm now in the 80s for... What was it?

05:18.994 --> 05:23.438
[SPEAKER_07]: True skill rank in single deathmatch.

05:23.958 --> 05:25.139
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of cool.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.501
[SPEAKER_07]: So top 80 players of the world.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.263
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in...

05:31.164 --> 05:34.187
[SPEAKER_07]: Just the cumulative deathmatch ranks.

05:34.448 --> 05:40.114
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm about to break 200, so I'll be in the top 200 there, which is cool.

05:40.334 --> 05:44.259
[SPEAKER_07]: And I still frustrate my coworkers a lot because I win all the time.

05:44.779 --> 05:45.220
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

05:45.240 --> 05:46.481
[SPEAKER_02]: You frustrate your co-hosts too.

05:46.881 --> 05:47.302
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all right.

05:48.143 --> 05:49.164
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not because I win all the time.

05:49.918 --> 06:09.530
[SPEAKER_07]: and then I played more Borderlands so that was fun and just kind of working a little bit through that and download the two expansions for that so hopefully I'll play those soon and then finally did work on my arcade cabinet I replaced the graphics card that was in there and

06:09.970 --> 06:13.131
[SPEAKER_07]: with a much faster one and much better one.

06:13.832 --> 06:18.654
[SPEAKER_07]: Because before I had an arcade VGA card because they were meant to output to an arcade cabinet.

06:18.734 --> 06:24.116
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you can do it with other graphics cards, but you have to run a special driver to do it.

06:24.596 --> 06:25.477
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I did that.

06:25.917 --> 06:27.978
[SPEAKER_07]: Finally, it took me forever to get the work right.

06:28.558 --> 06:32.120
[SPEAKER_07]: But now I can play my Naomi games full speed.

06:32.160 --> 06:35.761
[SPEAKER_07]: I can play Street Fighter 4 full speed.

06:36.562 --> 06:36.642
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

06:38.382 --> 07:05.551
[SPEAKER_07]: the only thing I can't play full speed right now that I really wish I could was my Taito X games like BlazBlue Continuum Shift is still kind of slow so I would need to get a slightly newer graphics card to get that one to work just right I think because the one I have right now the graphics card is only 64 bit which I should have bought a newer one but whatever so most of it works

07:07.116 --> 07:07.476
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

07:07.856 --> 07:09.017
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else you want to add?

07:09.917 --> 07:10.377
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, that's it.

07:10.697 --> 07:11.878
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

07:12.618 --> 07:13.098
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

07:13.939 --> 07:17.000
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura was kind of right when she was doing the impersonation of me there.

07:17.440 --> 07:20.141
[SPEAKER_06]: I did play a little bit of WoW this week, still leveling the characters.

07:21.182 --> 07:24.303
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what my payback's going to be for poking fun at DarkSakura?

07:24.343 --> 07:25.624
[SPEAKER_06]: Not making fun, poking fun.

07:25.704 --> 07:26.724
[SPEAKER_06]: I tease because I love.

07:27.124 --> 07:29.525
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to catch whatever she has, so I'm going to be here next week.

07:31.946 --> 07:32.887
[SPEAKER_02]: I put the fun in dysfunction.

07:49.409 --> 08:17.581
[SPEAKER_06]: MyGameWeek Not just WoW, I did play some other stuff too Although I did ding 37 I'm almost 38 Anyhow On my warrior Shut up Let's see, other games I played this week Because I did play some other stuff Okay, you remember last week on the show If you listened to last week's show I was squeeing all over the place Because Blaster Master Overdrive was coming out on the Wii Which is, you know, this sequel If you will, to the original Blaster Master On the NES

08:18.602 --> 08:21.545
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, of course, there was a version on the Genesis and Game Boy as well.

08:21.565 --> 08:23.447
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just kind of, I guess, assuming those didn't happen.

08:23.928 --> 08:25.650
[SPEAKER_06]: And this kind of came out of nowhere.

08:25.750 --> 08:27.232
[SPEAKER_06]: It was released this week on WiiWare.

08:27.712 --> 08:31.777
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, of course, Monday, I go home from work, automatically download this thing right away.

08:31.817 --> 08:32.918
[SPEAKER_06]: And I spent a little time with it.

08:33.579 --> 08:37.243
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure everybody wants to know my thoughts because I was so excited and I was happy about it last week.

08:37.303 --> 08:38.344
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I played it and...

08:40.146 --> 08:43.729
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess maybe I overhyped it a little bit.

08:43.749 --> 08:44.990
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't all that.

08:46.031 --> 08:46.591
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's the thing.

08:46.631 --> 08:47.832
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't bad.

08:48.733 --> 08:51.195
[SPEAKER_06]: It just wasn't what I thought it could have been.

08:51.996 --> 08:55.598
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple things I noticed right off the bat is that it did not support 16.9.

08:56.819 --> 09:00.683
[SPEAKER_06]: It still had the black bars on the left and right side of the screen on my widescreen TV.

09:01.403 --> 09:02.704
[SPEAKER_06]: The controls were a little weird.

09:02.744 --> 09:08.349
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the vehicle is supposed to control a little odd, but I felt like they overcompensated in the Blaster Master game.

09:09.029 --> 09:36.389
[SPEAKER_06]: um one of the things that kind of bugged me is I felt the different stages didn't have a lot of um differentness between them there wasn't a lot of uniqueness between the levels it's like one level was cave and it had brown walls and one level was outdoors but you go into a cave right away the other level was like ice cave and you're you have blue walls and and when you go into the overhead areas they're they're not that exciting they look like the dungeons from the 8-bit willow on the NES I mean it just kind of

09:37.129 --> 09:40.151
[SPEAKER_06]: Just different variations of a little maze like that.

09:40.591 --> 09:43.813
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wasn't all that floored with it.

09:44.153 --> 09:45.554
[SPEAKER_06]: But then you have to look at the other side of it.

09:45.634 --> 09:46.355
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the game was only $10.

09:47.455 --> 09:49.016
[SPEAKER_06]: They did Metroid it a little.

09:49.036 --> 09:50.577
[SPEAKER_06]: You have save points, you have maps.

09:50.717 --> 09:55.060
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like the way they did save points because only certain caves have save points.

09:55.100 --> 09:58.702
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes you don't want to drive around for 20 minutes looking for a save point.

09:59.082 --> 10:00.783
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I...

10:02.344 --> 10:03.544
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

10:23.171 --> 10:28.217
[SPEAKER_06]: That had been made for another system and then finished for the Wii.

10:28.257 --> 10:38.106
[SPEAKER_06]: I seriously think what I played was made for the PS1 or PS2 and then for whatever reason it didn't happen, it came out on the Wii instead.

10:38.807 --> 10:40.269
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what the game kind of felt like to me.

10:40.329 --> 10:44.393
[SPEAKER_06]: It felt like a mediocre PS1 game just suddenly now on the Wii.

10:44.913 --> 10:45.093
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

10:45.914 --> 11:08.268
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, the value, $10, the music kicks ass, a lot of the remixes are really cool, and you know, there is that nostalgia factor My only other big bitch, and this is damn near a game ruiner for me, like this is why I can't play Blaster Master Overdrive for long periods of time The controls blow, they absolutely blow, and it's one really logical flaw that makes it blow

11:09.875 --> 11:13.017
[SPEAKER_06]: You use your Wiimote, like, tilted to the side like an NES controller.

11:13.317 --> 11:15.278
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, all the buttons pretty much are used.

11:15.398 --> 11:17.839
[SPEAKER_06]: You use the A button, the giant one, to switch weapons.

11:18.219 --> 11:21.061
[SPEAKER_06]: You use the 1 button to fire your weapon, which, you know, makes sense.

11:21.461 --> 11:25.643
[SPEAKER_06]: You use the 2 button to fire a super weapon, which you do once in a great while.

11:25.943 --> 11:27.944
[SPEAKER_06]: So you don't really... And you don't want to hit that inadvertently.

11:28.424 --> 11:31.646
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you use the trigger button on the back of the controller...

11:31.926 --> 11:32.226
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.

11:51.526 --> 11:52.626
[SPEAKER_06]: Sucks.

11:52.746 --> 11:53.987
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not holding it.

11:54.847 --> 11:56.228
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know who thought that.

11:56.368 --> 11:57.808
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the first thing that made me think.

11:57.828 --> 12:10.952
[SPEAKER_07]: Why can't they just do it the old way where you would just hold the fire button down and then it would just stay firing in that one direction and you can move around strafe and then you just basically let go of it and turn and then hold it down again to shoot a different direction.

12:11.072 --> 12:13.354
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft asks, does it have classic controller support in our chatroom?

12:13.394 --> 12:15.695
[SPEAKER_06]: It does not, which I thought was a glaring omission too.

12:15.715 --> 12:17.557
[SPEAKER_06]: You can only play it with the NES controller.

12:32.948 --> 12:36.811
[SPEAKER_06]: or I'm sorry NES style regular Wiimote tilted to the side.

12:38.593 --> 12:39.433
[SPEAKER_06]: The controls blow.

12:39.694 --> 12:43.617
[SPEAKER_06]: I was really irritated that I couldn't remap it and that's the first thing that made me think.

12:43.917 --> 12:48.120
[SPEAKER_06]: I think someone just brought this over from like PS2 and thank you chat rooms for reminding me.

12:48.841 --> 12:50.682
[SPEAKER_06]: They did release a Blaster Master on PSX.

12:50.722 --> 12:51.043
[SPEAKER_06]: They did.

12:51.763 --> 12:55.726
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know if this was like a sequel that they started to make or a PS2 version.

12:55.786 --> 12:56.087
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

12:56.927 --> 12:59.929
[SPEAKER_06]: or, again, I'm hypothesizing just based on what I played.

12:59.969 --> 13:03.692
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't feel like it was made for the Wii because I think if it was, it would have supported 16.9.

13:04.752 --> 13:07.034
[SPEAKER_06]: So the controls really kind of ruined it for me.

13:07.154 --> 13:13.618
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's too bad because at the end of the day, it still seems like there's a fun game in there somewhere.

13:14.158 --> 13:16.500
[SPEAKER_06]: And for $10, it's still not a terrible deal.

13:16.980 --> 13:19.542
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just I would urge you to go spend your money on the original game.

13:20.194 --> 13:21.555
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, that's what I do.

13:21.956 --> 13:23.156
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was Blaster Master Overdrive.

13:38.328 --> 13:39.269
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

13:53.485 --> 14:22.221
[SPEAKER_06]: as far as Castle Crashers goes I love how they have all these little in jokes and they really souped it up and they added some things into it like you know fighting each other to see who can kiss the girl and the little power ups and the magic you know I think they did definitely take that genre of gaming to the next level so I was you know definitely Castle Crashers is a good buy if you haven't already bought it I mean it's like what the best selling Xbox 360 arcade game so I imagine most of you own it I just I'm slow in getting around to some games okay um

14:23.832 --> 14:50.755
[SPEAKER_06]: and then I didn't really play a whole lot else in depth but I watched my boyfriend play tons of games because he got a brand new monitor this week that's like a 25 inch monitor it's huge it's very similar to Dan's monitor it's gigantic and I just watched him play like Left 4 Dead 2 and Half-Life 2 like every neat looking game he owned he had to load within the scope of like two hours and it was pretty I will admit it was pretty and you know I played WoW on that thing too and it was very pretty very pretty

14:51.756 --> 14:53.757
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, that's about it for our gaming weeks.

14:54.297 --> 14:55.758
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to move on.

14:55.818 --> 14:57.719
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get into some news here in just a moment.

14:57.759 --> 14:59.180
[SPEAKER_06]: But first, we want to take some housekeeping.

14:59.220 --> 15:00.140
[SPEAKER_06]: It is Valentine's Day.

15:00.200 --> 15:03.242
[SPEAKER_06]: So for those that are celebrating Valentine's Day, happy Valentine's Day.

15:03.302 --> 15:04.043
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope it was a good one.

15:04.763 --> 15:08.345
[SPEAKER_06]: For those that aren't, well, take a moment to celebrate what you really love today.

15:08.645 --> 15:09.305
[SPEAKER_06]: Video games.

15:10.406 --> 15:14.628
[SPEAKER_06]: Join our chat, chat.orangeloungeradio.com and talk about the latest in gaming news this week with us.

15:15.268 --> 15:18.210
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, our Twitter and all that other stuff as well that I mentioned earlier.

15:18.570 --> 15:18.870
[SPEAKER_06]: X10 Event

15:43.400 --> 15:49.483
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, if you remember, I mean, the original Dead Rising came out, I think, 07 or 08?

15:49.884 --> 15:50.804
[SPEAKER_07]: Around the same time?

15:51.024 --> 15:51.805
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it was in August.

15:52.625 --> 15:53.405
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but that's pretty cool.

15:54.426 --> 15:56.487
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, uh, some of the stuff they were also showing off about it.

15:56.507 --> 16:09.274
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, apparently, of course, since this, you know, being X10, they announced that they're gonna have an exclusive, uh, to Xbox Live, Dead Rising 2 K-0, uh, which is a prologue to the sequel of the game.

16:10.554 --> 16:29.526
[SPEAKER_07]: and we'll kind of work as a game add-on and not only that it's basically going to be the demo for the game so you'll get to kind of get your Dead Rising on slightly earlier than the game actually comes out well now Loki demos are usually free and I'm guessing this is not going to be free

16:30.346 --> 16:43.037
[SPEAKER_06]: um maybe yeah okay maybe I mean maybe I'm not giving enough credit I mean if it's just gonna be a giant advertisement for the game maybe it will be free who knows but I just kind of doubt it I don't know why I'm being skeptical

16:44.624 --> 16:46.425
[SPEAKER_06]: History shows this kind of crap is usually not free.

17:09.252 --> 17:09.813
[SPEAKER_06]: He says no.

17:10.794 --> 17:12.596
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell them with the microphone, do you like games?

17:13.737 --> 17:14.058
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

17:16.080 --> 17:19.704
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then I don't know if we're going to be able to talk too much on the show tonight.

17:19.724 --> 17:20.445
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want mommy?

17:21.166 --> 17:22.087
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like to play the guitar?

17:24.252 --> 17:24.732
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Rob.

17:46.877 --> 17:47.157
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

17:47.878 --> 17:49.580
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll have achievements and all that good stuff, though, right?

17:49.960 --> 17:50.140
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

17:50.581 --> 17:54.385
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what would make a good... By the way, we have comments in chat room.

17:54.425 --> 18:03.073
[SPEAKER_06]: Chat.orangeonestradio.com Blackwolf in chat, our pal Bobby Blackwolf, who's on before us every Sunday at All Games Radio, says, Julian sounds like the ferret.

18:04.014 --> 18:04.234
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

18:06.276 --> 18:07.638
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to get him to say, excuse me.

18:07.658 --> 18:11.622
[SPEAKER_11]: No, he's the one to look in the garage.

18:12.243 --> 18:13.625
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's where all the pinball machines are, huh?

18:13.645 --> 18:14.526
[SPEAKER_02]: He loves the garage.

18:14.646 --> 18:15.647
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, of course he does.

18:16.188 --> 18:16.748
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a boy.

18:16.908 --> 18:18.751
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, we let a two-year-old derail the show, but that happens.

18:18.771 --> 18:19.972
[SPEAKER_06]: But he doesn't like games, though.

18:20.172 --> 18:20.452
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

18:21.033 --> 18:23.114
[SPEAKER_11]: Dead Rising 2 Dead Rising 2 Dead Rising 2 Dead Rising 2

18:50.922 --> 18:54.305
[SPEAKER_06]: I took pictures of zombies or something like, you know, Dead Rising, Snap.

19:11.718 --> 19:12.238
[SPEAKER_07]: Dead Rising is awesome.

19:36.328 --> 19:37.408
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, I enjoyed Dead Rising 2.

19:37.448 --> 19:38.929
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of a pleasant little surprise.

19:39.129 --> 19:41.749
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm kind of curious where they're going to go with the sequel.

19:42.129 --> 19:43.410
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the picture-taking thing, though.

19:43.710 --> 19:46.370
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the whole opening of the first game was like taking pictures, wasn't it?

19:46.470 --> 19:48.211
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but see, he's not a journalist this time.

19:48.231 --> 19:54.412
[SPEAKER_07]: This time he's like, you know, a duct tape expert because, you know, that's... Is that an actual job?

19:54.492 --> 19:58.973
[SPEAKER_06]: You can like... What would you study in college to become a duct tape expert?

20:00.513 --> 20:01.933
[SPEAKER_06]: Fusion, I would imagine.

20:04.134 --> 20:04.414
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

20:04.793 --> 20:05.133
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbox Live X10

20:24.578 --> 20:27.921
[SPEAKER_06]: The first game that's going to come out on March 3rd is called Toy Soldiers.

20:29.001 --> 20:33.224
[SPEAKER_06]: Scrap Metal is coming out as well, as well as Perfect Dark.

20:33.405 --> 20:37.968
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, they're going to do a remake of Perfect Dark, and that's coming out on Xbox Live Arcade this March.

20:38.188 --> 20:41.971
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, kind of coming out of nowhere, Game Room is coming out.

20:42.031 --> 20:44.212
[SPEAKER_06]: It has been confirmed that that will come out in March.

20:44.593 --> 20:45.914
[SPEAKER_06]: So at least we have a target date for that.

20:46.414 --> 20:47.755
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm guessing just...

20:48.035 --> 20:49.296
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect Dark Playthrough Perfect Dark Playthrough

21:09.557 --> 21:10.097
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe.

21:10.117 --> 21:11.158
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw him jumping.

21:11.278 --> 21:12.738
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a remake of the N64 one.

21:12.758 --> 21:13.999
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he can't jump in that.

21:14.059 --> 21:14.819
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I don't know.

21:15.179 --> 21:17.600
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, by the way, some of the price is already out for some of those as well.

21:17.640 --> 21:20.541
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect Dark will set you back $10, 800 Microsoft points.

21:20.901 --> 21:23.382
[SPEAKER_06]: Toy Soldiers and Scrap Metal, $15 a piece.

21:23.462 --> 21:24.843
[SPEAKER_06]: That's 1,200 Microsoft points.

21:25.183 --> 21:31.905
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, Game Room is free to download, but it will cost $3 if you want to play it on one system, either your 360 or your PC.

21:31.945 --> 21:33.486
[SPEAKER_06]: 400 Microsoft points or $5 for both systems.

21:37.147 --> 21:41.728
[SPEAKER_06]: or 50 cents, 40 Microsoft points for one play.

21:42.168 --> 21:46.869
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I always thought it was supposed to be two plays, two quarters for two plays, but I guess they scaled it back to one.

21:48.029 --> 21:48.549
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

21:48.589 --> 21:52.770
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are some of the prices of the games coming out on Xbox Live in March.

21:53.010 --> 21:54.111
[SPEAKER_06]: So definitely a very busy month.

21:54.371 --> 21:55.671
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything you guys are looking forward to?

21:55.691 --> 22:02.412
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm all about Game Room as much as I'm a little bit irritated that I've bought a lot of those games before.

22:02.972 --> 22:04.873
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what else I played this week?

22:05.033 --> 22:05.553
[SPEAKER_06]: The other night...

22:07.754 --> 22:34.955
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Alan was playing WoW or something and I was just I was there you know hanging out and I just fired up old Atari 2600 games I started playing Pitfall 2 The Lost Caverns I was playing that for a little bit and then I was playing an old old game called and I can't remember the name now Dragonfire I think it was called it was there was two modes to it one was where you were running across the drawbridge and you had to dodge the fireballs and then the second screen was you had to collect all the treasure and dodge the fireballs from the dragon I think it's called Dragonfire

22:35.916 --> 22:37.638
[SPEAKER_06]: I played those games for like an hour.

22:38.359 --> 22:38.979
[SPEAKER_06]: It's crazy.

22:39.500 --> 22:43.884
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm all about Game Room and playing some of the classic games again as long as it's not stuff I've already bought.

22:44.865 --> 22:51.472
[SPEAKER_06]: So I won't be buying Scramble, thank you very much, or Frogger, or Tempest or anything else that's already been on Xbox Live.

22:51.492 --> 22:56.136
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not buying Frogger just despite Frogger because I hate...

22:57.838 --> 23:02.063
[SPEAKER_07]: and the incessant whoring out of Frogger.

23:02.263 --> 23:04.366
[SPEAKER_07]: Konami, get a new game to whore out.

23:04.466 --> 23:05.046
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

23:05.147 --> 23:08.470
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not Frogger itself, the classic game that you have a problem with.

23:08.550 --> 23:10.873
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the incessant whoring of the franchise and what it's become.

23:10.893 --> 23:13.336
[SPEAKER_07]: They have made me hate the original game of Frogger now.

23:13.837 --> 23:17.718
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I remember when they first came out with that Frogger game on PS1, it was awesome.

23:17.838 --> 23:23.060
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, that first Frogger revival game was awesome when it first came out, but then it's like, that's all they make now.

23:25.021 --> 23:26.821
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't know.

23:27.822 --> 23:29.362
[SPEAKER_06]: But the original Frogger's okay.

23:29.422 --> 23:30.423
[SPEAKER_06]: My favorite Frogger...

23:31.303 --> 23:37.308
[SPEAKER_06]: My memories of Frogger were of being in 4th grade on roller skates playing at the skating rink in Dothan, Alabama

24:00.546 --> 24:02.989
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a roller rink in Roseville, California that I used to go to.

24:03.029 --> 24:03.730
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's still there.

24:03.750 --> 24:04.631
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Roller King.

24:04.651 --> 24:06.734
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to play Spy Hunter in the arcade there.

24:06.894 --> 24:13.883
[SPEAKER_02]: They had that same Frogger machine for at least 10 years.

24:15.224 --> 24:18.068
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would play it every summer on roller skates.

24:18.382 --> 24:20.345
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of Frogger hate in our chat room.

24:20.365 --> 24:23.329
[SPEAKER_06]: Chat.orange.com Ray Iannami says Frogger sucks.

24:23.730 --> 24:25.332
[SPEAKER_06]: Spyro says Frogger is scary.

24:25.733 --> 24:27.856
[SPEAKER_06]: Toagak says Frogger, go get hit by a car.

24:27.896 --> 24:31.862
[SPEAKER_02]: To this day though, I play Frogger best on roller skates.

24:32.964 --> 24:33.805
[SPEAKER_02]: On an arcade machine.

24:34.125 --> 24:39.068
[SPEAKER_06]: I play Spy Hunter best with roller skates, which always fascinated me because it had a gas pedal on those machines.

24:39.089 --> 24:41.850
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to see Frogger Shattered Soldier.

24:42.551 --> 24:44.652
[SPEAKER_07]: The funniest thing I ever saw.

24:44.852 --> 24:49.656
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this was in Chico, at a roller rink in Chico, California, where I went to school for college.

24:50.016 --> 24:56.480
[SPEAKER_06]: They had a DDR machine in a roller rink, and the first time I ever saw that, I was like, you know something bad's going to happen on that machine.

24:56.520 --> 25:01.344
[SPEAKER_02]: Some idgit's going to hop up on there and try to play in roller skates.

25:01.364 --> 25:01.444
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

25:01.784 --> 25:04.246
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, HitStun is showing the other side of the spectrum here.

25:04.326 --> 25:05.487
[SPEAKER_06]: One other comment about Frogger.

25:05.507 --> 25:08.729
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how we got on this tangent, and then we'll go to DarkSakura with another news story.

25:09.069 --> 25:11.251
[SPEAKER_06]: But HitStun gives another side of the token here.

25:12.232 --> 25:15.274
[SPEAKER_06]: Frogger is a great first video game for kids.

25:16.875 --> 25:17.876
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a valid argument.

25:18.016 --> 25:19.757
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a good kid video game.

25:19.997 --> 25:21.799
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, do you think he has a point?

25:24.541 --> 25:29.104
[SPEAKER_07]: If they want to turn him off of video games because they're going to frustrate the hell out of him.

25:30.727 --> 25:33.970
[SPEAKER_02]: I can look at it as an educational tool for hand-eye coordination.

25:34.210 --> 25:38.053
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a classic excuse we use with our parents.

25:38.214 --> 25:40.816
[SPEAKER_06]: Mother, I'm working on my hand-eye coordination.

25:41.196 --> 25:48.162
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're dealing with the concept of objects in motion.

25:49.583 --> 26:16.928
[SPEAKER_02]: so it honestly and I've actually I found a study on this a few years ago where they were saying talking about games like Frogger as being ones that teach about physics in motion so well but couldn't you learn hand-eye coordination from Street Fighter 4 you know let the kid get his butt kicked a little but it's the whole point of things moving in opposite directions of you know horizontal versus vertical movement you know spatial relations

26:18.314 --> 26:18.995
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, fine.

26:19.135 --> 26:23.803
[SPEAKER_06]: Azure Edge in chat, by the way, jumped in and said Battletoads was his first game.

26:24.624 --> 26:25.806
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a game that gets you sick.

26:25.826 --> 26:26.527
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a game.

26:27.228 --> 26:28.610
[SPEAKER_02]: I can already tell you what mine was.

26:29.632 --> 26:30.073
[SPEAKER_02]: Pong.

26:30.093 --> 26:31.094
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, of course.

26:31.114 --> 26:31.996
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Kangaroo.

26:32.717 --> 26:37.599
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember what my first first game was, but I have really early memories of playing combat.

26:37.779 --> 26:41.781
[SPEAKER_06]: It was probably combat when the family got an Atari 2600 and Spider-Man.

26:42.061 --> 26:47.764
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember going in my mom's bedroom where the Atari 2600 was hooked up so that she could limit my playtime to play Spider-Man.

26:47.984 --> 26:52.226
[SPEAKER_02]: We always had CryptoQuip at my friend's house because we had an Odyssey 2.

26:53.206 --> 26:54.267
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

27:06.149 --> 27:29.704
[SPEAKER_06]: I always wanted a ColecoVision but my mother I think I have two my mother wouldn't give me one because she says we have an Atari 2600 we don't need the other one which you know she made a point the ColecoVision I'm sorry was far superior alright especially since it had the expansion module that you could play Atari 2600 games on plus once we got the Commodore 64 that's really all I played for years and years I didn't even touch 2600 anymore it was all about the Commodore 64 that thing was awesome what was it TI-85 nice

27:32.026 --> 27:34.509
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, let's move on with more gaming news.

27:34.569 --> 27:35.891
[SPEAKER_06]: Fast forward to now.

27:36.992 --> 27:37.453
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

27:38.334 --> 27:40.036
[SPEAKER_02]: I really shouldn't have been talking that much, too.

27:40.056 --> 27:40.737
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

27:41.118 --> 27:44.762
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Halo Reach Beta has a date.

27:45.003 --> 27:48.727
[SPEAKER_02]: It's May 3rd, but only if you already have ODST.

27:50.449 --> 27:58.612
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, at the X10 event, Microsoft made the announcement that the multiplayer beta was going to begin for the ODST owners.

27:58.892 --> 28:04.754
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, that means you have to actually have the ODST disk to access the beta.

28:05.814 --> 28:07.315
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yay, I have it.

28:07.848 --> 28:10.649
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, I mean, it makes sense.

28:10.829 --> 28:16.472
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the people that are going to want to play Halo Reach right away already have Halo ODST.

28:16.632 --> 28:17.953
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it makes sense.

28:18.333 --> 28:26.737
[SPEAKER_06]: I imagine if you're a Halo fan, you know, it's not like they're pairing it with a game like Crackdown where you have to kind of go outside the genre to pick up this game.

28:26.757 --> 28:29.018
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, remember when the Halo 3 beta came with Crackdown?

28:29.318 --> 28:32.380
[SPEAKER_06]: You had to buy this completely different game to get access to the Halo 3 beta.

28:33.407 --> 28:34.368
[SPEAKER_02]: Crackdown was fun, though.

28:34.388 --> 28:38.752
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, although it turned out, I mean, thankfully, Crackdown was a pretty good game, but imagine if it hadn't been.

28:39.312 --> 28:40.513
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that could have been a bad thing.

28:40.854 --> 28:44.237
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I mean, it makes sense that they're doing it that way.

28:44.277 --> 28:46.539
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to tell you what the joy of Crackdown was for me.

28:47.019 --> 28:49.021
[SPEAKER_06]: Jump, wave, jumping, huge.

28:49.201 --> 28:52.944
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming in the house and having Dan and Will play Crackdown.

28:53.445 --> 28:54.766
[SPEAKER_02]: Going, I like jumping!

28:55.447 --> 28:55.787
Yeah.

28:56.107 --> 28:57.488
[SPEAKER_02]: and that little high-pitched voice.

28:58.069 --> 28:58.769
[SPEAKER_03]: I like jumping!

28:59.470 --> 29:00.150
[SPEAKER_03]: I like jumping!

29:01.571 --> 29:02.131
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

29:02.872 --> 29:03.352
I know.

29:03.452 --> 29:04.573
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets stuck in my head.

29:04.893 --> 29:09.277
[SPEAKER_02]: So every time I think about Crackdown, I instantly hear Dan and Will in my head going, I like jumping!

29:09.537 --> 29:11.558
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you won't have to worry about that when Perfect Dark comes out.

29:13.119 --> 29:14.100
[SPEAKER_02]: I like not jumping.

29:14.801 --> 29:16.622
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, what do you think of the whole Halo thing?

29:16.642 --> 29:22.326
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, for me, I'm like, oh darn, I would have liked a free demo that I could download and play, but I can't hate on what they're doing.

29:22.844 --> 29:26.385
[SPEAKER_07]: They did the same thing with Crackdown, of course.

29:26.585 --> 29:29.666
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not surprised that they're doing the same thing with this.

29:31.066 --> 29:38.688
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't care because I didn't play much of the Halo 3 beta and I just can't see myself playing much of the Halo Reach beta.

29:41.549 --> 29:44.850
[SPEAKER_06]: Halo Online for me is just not that big.

29:45.230 --> 29:45.951
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

30:10.493 --> 30:10.894
[SPEAKER_06]: That much.

30:11.134 --> 30:13.878
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can't see myself getting into these other ones.

30:13.898 --> 30:14.539
[SPEAKER_06]: But you never know.

30:14.599 --> 30:19.946
[SPEAKER_06]: If my college buddies call me up and say, Rob, you gotta get Halo Reach so we can all play again, I'd probably do it.

30:20.787 --> 30:21.187
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

30:22.469 --> 30:23.030
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on.

30:23.090 --> 30:26.154
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, you have a lot, a lot of news here coming from another presser.

30:26.502 --> 30:30.123
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, EA, they had a bunch of stuff coming out.

30:30.163 --> 30:33.664
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say it's from their end of the fiscal quarter stuff.

30:34.484 --> 30:40.745
[SPEAKER_07]: And they released their tentative release schedule for fiscal 2011.

30:41.345 --> 30:47.787
[SPEAKER_07]: So running from April or I guess, yeah, April to April 2011.

30:47.827 --> 30:47.907
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

30:51.851 --> 30:56.735
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, some stuff's not a big surprise, you know, sequels to big franchises.

30:57.455 --> 31:04.180
[SPEAKER_07]: One that's already been teased already, Dead Space 2 is slated for early 2011.

31:04.361 --> 31:07.383
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't really say when, I guess Q4 of 2011, so...

31:09.324 --> 31:11.405
[SPEAKER_07]: Summer between January and March of 2011.

31:12.466 --> 31:17.688
[SPEAKER_07]: You can expect that one to be coming, of course, on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

31:18.048 --> 31:22.330
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe they're skipping the PC version this time around.

31:23.011 --> 31:35.817
[SPEAKER_07]: Some other things also have been teased before and are coming by holiday of 2010, Crisis 2, which was on the cover recently of one of the game magazines, supposed to be taking place in New York.

31:36.877 --> 31:39.699
[SPEAKER_07]: and Sims 3 will be making its way out to consoles.

31:40.199 --> 31:50.003
[SPEAKER_07]: Also NBA Jam coming this holiday and EA Sports MMA supposed to be coming out between October and December of 2010 as well.

31:52.558 --> 31:56.280
[SPEAKER_07]: and some other smaller stuff also being put out.

31:58.141 --> 32:02.963
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, new Harry Potter, tie in with the Deathly Hallows.

32:03.243 --> 32:05.764
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, those games make money.

32:06.104 --> 32:09.265
[SPEAKER_06]: Those Harry Potter games, they make money and they've only got a little bit left.

32:09.686 --> 32:12.627
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, they'll probably still find a way to crank out those games even when the movies are done.

32:12.927 --> 32:18.852
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, I could see them doing some... Hell, they did Lord of the Rings games for the longest time.

32:19.172 --> 32:21.054
[SPEAKER_07]: They have another Lord of the Rings game coming out in the movie.

32:21.074 --> 32:22.475
[SPEAKER_06]: Harry Potter MMO.

32:23.476 --> 32:24.997
[SPEAKER_06]: You know someone wants to do it.

32:25.838 --> 32:26.959
[SPEAKER_06]: You know someone wants to do it.

32:26.999 --> 32:27.720
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be epic.

32:27.920 --> 32:33.344
[SPEAKER_06]: Do it a Harry Potter MMO with all the people I know that are really into the Harry Potter fandom.

32:33.885 --> 32:35.106
[SPEAKER_06]: Just log on to LiveJournal.

32:35.146 --> 32:36.527
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll find tons of people that love

32:36.727 --> 32:38.449
[SPEAKER_06]: That would get Nelly playing MMOs.

32:38.809 --> 32:44.114
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm telling you, I am kind of shocked there isn't already one talked in development.

32:45.175 --> 32:57.426
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be the game somebody makes once all the others... Wouldn't it be awesome, just totally unrealistic and never going to happen, but wouldn't it be awesome the next game that Blizzard is developing is Harry Potter MMO?

32:57.606 --> 32:57.906
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

32:58.747 --> 33:00.508
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like something ridiculous.

33:00.768 --> 33:01.409
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

33:02.049 --> 33:06.512
[SPEAKER_06]: If Blizzard were making that, even I would have to play it.

33:06.692 --> 33:07.493
[SPEAKER_06]: I really would.

33:07.993 --> 33:08.854
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I've said.

33:08.914 --> 33:10.375
[SPEAKER_06]: Blizzard really doesn't make bad games.

33:10.955 --> 33:13.076
[SPEAKER_06]: They haven't made a bad game in about 25 years.

33:14.257 --> 33:15.698
[SPEAKER_06]: Blizzard doesn't really make bad games.

33:17.859 --> 33:18.820
[SPEAKER_07]: Some other games coming out.

33:19.681 --> 33:34.711
[SPEAKER_07]: Between July 1st and September 30th, the real-time world's crime-themed MMO, which this will probably get me into MMOs as well, APB, or what I like to call Saints Row Grand Theft Auto Online, which would be awesome.

33:35.251 --> 33:42.635
[SPEAKER_07]: and then of course the next Medal of Honor game right now slated for the summer as well.

33:42.795 --> 33:44.456
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, no, I take that back.

33:44.596 --> 33:51.000
[SPEAKER_07]: It's sometime between now and March 2011, so anytime I guess for Medal of Honor.

33:52.601 --> 34:01.451
[SPEAKER_07]: And, let's see, to kind of go with the more casual crowd, they're going to be doing some new EA Sports Active games, which are due out around this holiday.

34:02.172 --> 34:06.116
[SPEAKER_07]: And, of course, it's not surprising, but they're going to be possibly...

34:07.297 --> 34:16.966
[SPEAKER_07]: I played those games myself and I had a bitch with them and my bitch was you couldn't skip exercises that the system was not recognizing you as actually doing due to the limitations of the Wii motion recognition which ticked me off.

34:30.459 --> 34:31.100
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

34:51.539 --> 35:00.304
[SPEAKER_06]: and you can use the board if you have it but a common misconception about EA Sports or EA Active, you do not need the balance board to play it.

35:00.504 --> 35:04.426
[SPEAKER_06]: It comes with a little wrist strap thing that you don't even really use.

35:04.446 --> 35:05.487
[SPEAKER_06]: The resistance band.

35:05.647 --> 35:08.209
[SPEAKER_06]: Well yeah, the resistance band, I'm sorry, not the wrist strap, the leg strap.

35:09.569 --> 35:14.292
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you put this thing on your leg and you put the Wiimote in it so it senses when you're running a little better.

35:15.493 --> 35:17.334
[SPEAKER_02]: I would rather just have real resistance bands.

35:18.918 --> 35:22.941
[SPEAKER_02]: The only reason I've won it because that's a better workout.

35:23.362 --> 35:27.765
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing is going to replace like the gym and eating healthier.

35:27.805 --> 35:31.529
[SPEAKER_07]: But it will probably be a little bit better than fake hula hooping on.

35:31.549 --> 35:32.650
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, exactly.

35:32.670 --> 35:34.631
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what though I think that a great way to lose weight is?

35:35.212 --> 35:35.913
[SPEAKER_02]: Stomach virus.

35:37.314 --> 35:37.694
[SPEAKER_06]: Tapeworm.

35:38.795 --> 35:39.216
[SPEAKER_06]: Tapeworms, too.

35:55.045 --> 35:56.366
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that it or is there more EA?

35:56.626 --> 35:57.687
[SPEAKER_07]: There's more, just real quick.

35:58.307 --> 36:02.070
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, Dragon Age will be getting a sequel in early 2011 as well.

36:02.150 --> 36:06.193
[SPEAKER_07]: Now this is important because Dragon Age was pretty badass.

36:06.573 --> 36:10.456
[SPEAKER_07]: What's also interesting though is it will be making its way out to portables as well.

36:10.836 --> 36:12.918
[SPEAKER_07]: The DS and PSP or possibly cell phones.

36:16.262 --> 36:20.304
[SPEAKER_06]: Epic Dragon Age is very epic, so I'm not surprised at all that there's a sequel.

36:20.404 --> 36:21.845
[SPEAKER_06]: Sequel to a successful franchise?

36:21.925 --> 36:22.265
[SPEAKER_06]: No!

36:22.646 --> 36:26.148
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of surprised it's coming out so fast, but there you go.

36:27.308 --> 36:29.289
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only, what, a year since the last one?

36:29.549 --> 36:30.430
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but this is coming out in 2011.

36:30.470 --> 36:31.431
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be over a year.

36:31.451 --> 36:32.891
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, they didn't say beginning 2011.

36:32.931 --> 36:33.072
[SPEAKER_06]: Early 2011.

36:33.112 --> 36:33.852
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's 18 months, maybe.

36:39.896 --> 36:41.237
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll probably be the same engine.

36:41.558 --> 36:45.822
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really a long time in the gaming world.

36:45.863 --> 36:46.964
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.

36:47.845 --> 36:48.305
[SPEAKER_06]: True.

36:48.325 --> 36:52.810
[SPEAKER_06]: They've already put out at least two of those EA Active games, if not three or four.

36:52.830 --> 36:54.913
[SPEAKER_06]: There's going to be even more, but still.

36:54.933 --> 36:59.418
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like a one-tenth of a Duke Nukem Forever.

37:00.410 --> 37:03.111
[SPEAKER_06]: All I'm saying is that, you know, they need to just make sure you take the time to get it right.

37:03.151 --> 37:03.431
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all.

37:03.631 --> 37:06.833
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Mass Effect 1 and 2 probably had a similar gap between them, right?

37:06.933 --> 37:08.454
[SPEAKER_06]: Mass Effect 1 and 2 is probably what?

37:08.514 --> 37:10.575
[SPEAKER_06]: About 18 months or maybe two years, right?

37:10.875 --> 37:12.736
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe somebody in chat knows better.

37:12.776 --> 37:15.257
[SPEAKER_07]: Mass Effect 1, I believe, was November 08.

37:16.577 --> 37:18.898
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, yeah, it's about the same.

37:18.998 --> 37:23.460
[SPEAKER_06]: There's people out there proclaiming Mass Effect 2 is the greatest video game ever made, period.

37:23.480 --> 37:26.862
[SPEAKER_07]: It's supposed to be better because it's, you know, the combat's a lot better.

37:27.322 --> 37:29.824
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, it looks interesting, but I'm not going to buy it.

37:30.044 --> 37:33.727
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's on my to-play list, but I've got to be honest with y'all.

37:34.348 --> 37:42.614
[SPEAKER_06]: I have been a Final Fantasy fanboy since the very, very first one that my friend and I used the strategy guide made by Nintendo Power to get through.

37:43.635 --> 37:45.096
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be buying Final Fantasy XIII.

37:45.136 --> 37:47.398
[SPEAKER_06]: You probably won't hear me talk about anything but that until I beat it.

37:48.118 --> 37:48.979
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

37:50.180 --> 37:50.420
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow.

37:52.244 --> 37:56.788
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, that didn't really happen with Final Fantasy XII, but I blame XII.

37:57.409 --> 37:59.911
[SPEAKER_06]: XII should not have been on the PS2, but that's for another day.

37:59.951 --> 38:02.974
[SPEAKER_06]: Go back and listen to old episodes if you want to know more thoughts on that.

38:03.774 --> 38:04.535
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so I don't know.

38:04.795 --> 38:08.118
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything out of EA real quickly before we move on with the news that makes you very excited?

38:08.178 --> 38:13.083
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the Dragon Age story is pretty cool, and NBA Jam I'm certainly looking forward to as well.

38:13.827 --> 38:20.210
[SPEAKER_07]: I think NBA Jam is going to be a letdown because the NBA games haven't been that great.

38:22.450 --> 38:28.313
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless they make it control more like a traditional NBA Jam game, that's the only way I can see that being good.

38:28.413 --> 38:34.795
[SPEAKER_07]: But either EA's NBA Live games are not good on the Wii.

38:36.035 --> 38:39.877
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, they sold so poorly that they didn't put one out this year.

38:41.554 --> 39:01.722
[SPEAKER_06]: AkumaJP in chat says don't get your hopes too high though Rob that's a good point I've heard Final Fantasy XIII has been getting some slack the whole like no towns thing and it's linear but well and also I should know better than to get my hopes high very high for a game because that's what I do with Blaster Master we just need Blitz, NFL Blitz

39:02.902 --> 39:04.123
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking Final Fantasy, but whatever.

39:04.163 --> 39:04.423
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

39:04.623 --> 39:04.803
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

39:05.003 --> 39:06.264
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Final Fantasy is going to be awesome.

39:06.284 --> 39:08.084
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's what Akuma's saying.

39:08.164 --> 39:08.565
[SPEAKER_06]: Be careful.

39:08.605 --> 39:10.866
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't hype it too much because it might not be all that.

39:12.607 --> 39:14.227
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, people have been playing the Japanese version.

39:14.367 --> 39:15.668
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it sounds good, so.

39:17.267 --> 39:22.230
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well moving on to some, I don't know, this is kind of a mixed bag of news.

39:22.290 --> 39:23.291
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good news and bad news.

39:24.372 --> 39:30.256
[SPEAKER_06]: Activision plans on reducing the number of Guitar Hero, Band Hero, and the Music Hero franchises that they do in 2010.

39:30.636 --> 39:41.043
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is coming word of mouth from the Activision Publishing CEO, Mike Griffith, who of course they had a conference call this week, saying that fewer SKUs will service a broader audience.

39:41.083 --> 39:41.963
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2009, we released 25 music SKUs.

39:42.024 --> 39:44.005
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2010, we plan to release less than 10.

39:47.367 --> 39:56.414
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, of course, the speculation is, okay, well, they're going to do away with probably the PS2 bundles that can't be selling very well and probably a lot of these band-specific games and so forth.

39:56.514 --> 40:04.460
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, they do a lot of game and then game plus plastic instrument, game plus plastic instruments.

40:04.700 --> 40:06.021
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're going to be cutting back on those.

40:06.041 --> 40:08.283
[SPEAKER_06]: I imagine a lot of these are going to be game only, right?

40:08.403 --> 40:10.925
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll leave the bundling to the Costcos of the world, right?

40:11.646 --> 40:11.826
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

40:12.486 --> 40:12.766
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

40:13.807 --> 40:20.992
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think, and although you're going to hear that there's just less music games coming from them, which I think we all kind of view as a good thing.

40:21.373 --> 40:23.574
[SPEAKER_06]: We knew Guitar Hero was getting too saturated.

40:23.634 --> 40:29.679
[SPEAKER_06]: This whole Guitar Hero, Van Halen, Guitar Hero 5, Band Hero, all coming out within like a month of each other, too much.

40:30.339 --> 40:30.660
[SPEAKER_06]: Too much.

40:31.600 --> 41:01.305
[SPEAKER_06]: unfortunately when you talk about making a decision like that which we do say is a good thing the bad news is they're going to lay off people because they don't need them anymore and some different companies really got hit hard with layoffs this week I heard Neversoft really got hit hard also Underground Development who made the Guitar Hero Van Halen game and they also did a Dave Mira BMX series they've been slaughtered completely they're out also surprisingly kind of an end of an era

41:01.585 --> 41:02.986
[SPEAKER_06]: for us here at Orange Lounge Radio.

41:03.026 --> 41:06.007
[SPEAKER_06]: You know this show started because of Dance Dance Revolution.

41:06.047 --> 41:08.649
[SPEAKER_06]: We all met playing DDR at the arcade and talked about music games.

41:09.209 --> 41:19.734
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you've ever been to a DDR tournament, especially back in the day, it was probably sponsored by a little company trying to sell their DDR pads and their expensive mats that would help you do a better DDR game at home.

41:20.154 --> 41:21.695
[SPEAKER_06]: Red Octane, that's how they started.

41:22.135 --> 41:27.318
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, as you know, Red Octane teamed up with Harmonix for the first Guitar Hero game.

41:28.298 --> 41:28.939
[SPEAKER_06]: Red Octane

41:29.699 --> 41:31.499
[SPEAKER_06]: has been shut down.

41:32.200 --> 41:38.141
[SPEAKER_06]: Only the staff that is directly involved with instrument development will stay at Activision, otherwise the rest of it's gone.

41:39.522 --> 41:41.942
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of the end of an era in ways.

41:42.142 --> 41:43.483
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know, what do you guys think?

41:43.663 --> 41:49.404
[SPEAKER_06]: Having been fans of music games and kind of knowing Red Octane and seeing their peeps out at DDR Tournament, what do you think?

41:49.724 --> 41:51.665
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw this coming for the moment of the acquisition.

41:53.245 --> 41:53.825
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I say it?

41:55.165 --> 41:56.286
[SPEAKER_06]: It's sad but true, yeah.

41:56.526 --> 41:57.006
[SPEAKER_06]: I could see that.

41:57.620 --> 42:00.923
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew they were going to squeeze what they could out of them the moment the money got bad.

42:01.223 --> 42:01.523
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut.

42:02.704 --> 42:02.964
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki?

42:03.565 --> 42:04.185
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not surprised.

42:04.886 --> 42:12.592
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been cutting a lot of different smaller studios and stuff, but guess we're not going to get in the groove.

42:15.033 --> 42:19.977
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I gotta say, now the in the groove fanboys can finally shut the fuck up.

42:20.097 --> 42:21.238
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously.

42:22.459 --> 42:23.400
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just not going to happen.

42:23.420 --> 42:24.461
[SPEAKER_06]: Just go away.

42:25.641 --> 42:45.854
[SPEAKER_06]: Duke Nukem Forever will happen before that so anyhow yes also as mentioned let's see what else Luxaflux was shut out never soft employees were hit half of radical entertainment staff I mean it's just it was it was not fun times at Activision this week so of course

42:46.294 --> 42:46.855
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

43:04.668 --> 43:05.068
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

43:06.909 --> 43:12.690
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how about something, a different type of sacking altogether.

43:14.651 --> 43:29.155
[SPEAKER_02]: For anyone who was interested, and I'm really not one of them, but I know people who were interested in the Alan Wake game, they actually announced that the PC version is not going to be happening again.

43:29.856 --> 43:36.003
[SPEAKER_02]: The Xbox 360 version of Alan Wake will be out on May 21st, but it will not be out on PC.

43:36.083 --> 43:36.924
[SPEAKER_02]: It just will not work.

43:39.795 --> 43:43.017
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't know, is this surprising or no?

43:43.077 --> 43:49.641
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, in a way, a lot of these games now are developed with the console in mind first, and then the PC secondary, so if it didn't work, it didn't work.

43:50.241 --> 44:04.230
[SPEAKER_06]: But still, if you're still a PC gamer at heart, and I gotta say, you know, I was watching Alan play Bioshock this week on his, just for a little bit, on his fancy new monitor, and he's got a video card and everything, I was like, dang, this, in a lot of ways, this looks better than it does on the 360.

44:04.550 --> 44:08.553
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's, there's still a lot of good stuff in PC games.

44:08.713 --> 44:08.913
[SPEAKER_02]: Well,

44:09.153 --> 44:14.714
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to tell you, because keep in mind, now I'm playing Star Trek Online with an old video card.

44:15.134 --> 44:16.474
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to be upgrading mine soon.

44:16.574 --> 44:23.636
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've seen screen captures for people who've played on the newest GeForce, and it's amazing.

44:24.256 --> 44:28.697
[SPEAKER_02]: So really having the right card makes all the difference with a lot of PC games.

44:30.057 --> 44:31.237
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, here's an example, Rob.

44:32.277 --> 44:36.098
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonic R, which I have on Saturn, and I have on PC.

44:37.699 --> 44:41.043
[SPEAKER_02]: and I played it back in the day when I got a new Radeon on the PC.

44:41.604 --> 44:53.758
[SPEAKER_02]: Same game, either way, played so much better on the PC, looked cleaner, so it does make a difference if your computer's a little bit better than spec, you know what I mean?

44:54.418 --> 45:03.301
[SPEAKER_06]: Part of me thinks I'll be playing Microsoft Game Room more on my PC than I will my 360 because, well, I won't have to use the 360 controller on my PC.

45:03.341 --> 45:06.422
[SPEAKER_06]: I can get a decent pad for like 15 bucks.

45:06.782 --> 45:08.262
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the 360 controller.

45:09.103 --> 45:10.323
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate the D-pad, though.

45:10.383 --> 45:12.504
[SPEAKER_06]: Playing a classic game on that's going to blow.

45:13.584 --> 45:16.425
[SPEAKER_06]: So, unless Microsoft releases a new pad.

45:16.725 --> 45:19.946
[SPEAKER_02]: I still want an adapter so I can use my Saturn dual analog controller.

45:20.846 --> 45:22.787
[SPEAKER_02]: The best controller ever.

45:23.547 --> 45:24.808
[SPEAKER_06]: I am interested in Alan Wake, though.

45:24.848 --> 45:25.689
[SPEAKER_06]: I will throw that out there.

45:25.709 --> 45:30.272
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want to play that when it comes out among all the other, my gosh, games to catch up on this year.

45:30.992 --> 45:33.574
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, quick follow-up to the last story we were talking about.

45:33.714 --> 45:37.416
[SPEAKER_06]: I just decided for Chits and Giggles to go to RedOctane.com.

45:38.077 --> 45:41.919
[SPEAKER_06]: It now forwards you automatically to the GuitarHeroStore.com.

45:42.139 --> 45:43.200
[SPEAKER_06]: It did for the longest time.

45:43.220 --> 45:44.340
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

46:10.809 --> 46:16.973
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, let's travel around the globe and check out some upcoming release dates for things on systems you will be able to get.

46:17.653 --> 46:27.839
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, this week, in fact today, you can pick up your Wii Remote in blue or pink just in time for Valentine's Day.

46:29.060 --> 46:31.602
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that you know what sex your Wii Remote is.

46:34.303 --> 46:38.445
[SPEAKER_07]: On the Wii will be Data East Arcade Classics coming out this week.

46:38.925 --> 46:42.367
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can get your BurgerTime and your Bad Dudes on.

46:42.547 --> 46:43.128
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's cool.

46:43.148 --> 46:44.828
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that coming out on any other systems or just Wii?

46:44.948 --> 46:45.249
[SPEAKER_06]: Just Wii.

46:46.229 --> 46:46.449
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh.

46:47.130 --> 46:48.410
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you a bad enough dude to say the president?

46:48.430 --> 46:49.291
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say Bad Dudes.

46:51.388 --> 46:55.910
[SPEAKER_07]: And it also has the BurgerTime sequel on there.

46:56.951 --> 46:58.371
[SPEAKER_06]: I've played the BurgerTime sequel.

46:59.972 --> 47:07.996
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's a typical sequel to an arcade game where the original was more fun in your memories than the sequel was.

47:08.896 --> 47:13.019
[SPEAKER_07]: Dynasty Warriors Strike Force coming out this week on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

47:15.561 --> 47:23.026
[SPEAKER_07]: SOCOM US Navy SEALS Fireteam Bravo 3 finally making its way out after quite a few delays on PSP this week.

47:23.306 --> 47:28.029
[SPEAKER_07]: Aliens vs. Predator coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and PC.

47:29.090 --> 47:35.694
[SPEAKER_07]: Jayma will be happy to know that Ragnarok, formerly known as Ragnarok Online, will be making its way out for the DS this week.

47:35.996 --> 47:37.597
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, playing it in English.

47:38.698 --> 47:42.080
[SPEAKER_07]: Tropico 3, coming out on Xbox 360 this week.

47:42.820 --> 47:47.082
[SPEAKER_07]: Ace Attorney Investigations, Miles Edgeworth, making its way out on the DS.

47:48.263 --> 47:55.507
[SPEAKER_07]: The sequel to the music-making game, Korg DS 10+, making its way out on the DS.

47:55.687 --> 47:57.248
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that like Korg is in the keyboard?

47:57.368 --> 47:57.889
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it is.

47:58.069 --> 47:58.509
[SPEAKER_07]: Sweet.

47:59.210 --> 48:03.172
[SPEAKER_07]: Chicken Riot, a budget shooter game coming out on the Wii.

48:04.833 --> 48:04.933
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

48:06.758 --> 48:07.620
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here.

48:11.127 --> 48:13.192
[SPEAKER_07]: Free Running, making its way out on the Wii.

48:14.775 --> 48:14.995
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

48:18.389 --> 48:42.396
[SPEAKER_07]: Deadly Premonition coming out on Xbox 360 this week kind of a budget survival horror game and the PC collection of Strong Bad's cool game for attractive people making its way out as well and looks like a re-release of the oh no actually this may be the original Fallout Fallout trilogy on PC for $14.99 not bad

48:44.747 --> 48:45.127
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

49:01.997 --> 49:10.244
[SPEAKER_06]: Dante's Inferno makes its way, a version for Japan coming out this week on the 18th, as well as Eat Lead, the return of Matt Hazard coming out on the 360.

49:10.625 --> 49:15.889
[SPEAKER_06]: Heading on over to the PlayStation 3, of course you also get Biohazard 5 there, but they call it the Alternative Edition.

49:16.610 --> 49:20.813
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if this is just simply a price reduction or if they were adding something to it.

49:20.873 --> 49:23.876
[SPEAKER_07]: It might be the Gold Edition that's coming out over here in March.

49:24.156 --> 49:24.636
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it is.

49:24.977 --> 49:27.419
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like the, you know, souped up a little bit.

49:27.879 --> 49:30.983
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, of course, Eat Lead and Dante's Inferno, also on the PS3.

49:31.123 --> 49:38.132
[SPEAKER_06]: Also on the PS3, something that had a demo here in the States this week, Heavy Rain, the origami killer, comes out on the 18th in Japan.

49:38.613 --> 49:44.120
[SPEAKER_06]: Also in Japan, Shin Sangoku Mosu Online, Kamishu Rambu comes out.

49:45.141 --> 49:45.281
[SPEAKER_06]: It's...

49:46.022 --> 49:47.383
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that Romance of the Three Kingdoms?

49:47.403 --> 49:48.383
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think it's nice.

49:48.463 --> 49:50.104
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's right.

50:03.411 --> 50:05.053
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks Dynasty Wars-ish.

50:05.273 --> 50:08.015
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it has the combo meter and everything.

50:08.156 --> 50:13.160
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably a mix of the two because it is from Koei.

50:14.942 --> 50:19.066
[SPEAKER_07]: That might be their version of Strike Force or there's a Samurai Warriors game coming out.

50:19.687 --> 50:20.448
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network,

50:35.546 --> 50:37.547
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if that one's coming out exactly.

50:38.487 --> 50:40.607
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, there is a premium version of that if you want as well.

50:40.707 --> 50:43.468
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, quickly, big release for PS3 in Japan this week.

50:43.528 --> 50:44.848
[SPEAKER_06]: Skate 2 gets a price reduction.

50:45.008 --> 50:46.709
[SPEAKER_06]: Uncharted gets a bundle pack this week.

50:47.169 --> 50:49.249
[SPEAKER_06]: Next week, Demon's Souls is getting a price reduction.

50:49.269 --> 50:51.310
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a pretty awesome PS3 exclusive.

50:51.990 --> 50:55.151
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing on the Wii this week in Japan, which is somewhat surprising.

50:55.191 --> 50:57.451
[SPEAKER_06]: That's because next week is a pretty big week.

50:57.492 --> 51:02.433
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a lot of games, including the Tales of Symphonia getting a price reduction.

51:02.453 --> 51:03.153
[SPEAKER_06]: That's next week, though.

51:04.093 --> 51:17.924
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation 2 of course the pickings are getting a little slimmer there on PS2 but they have a game called Last Escort Club Kotze is coming out in regular and limited editions the DS gets Yu-Gi-Oh!

51:17.984 --> 51:20.986
[SPEAKER_06]: 5D's World Championship 2010 Reverse of Arcadia

51:21.738 --> 51:25.761
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're still playing Yu-Gi-Oh!, you're in for a treat this week in Japan.

51:26.221 --> 51:43.915
[SPEAKER_06]: Lastly on the PSP this week, Last Escort as well, and let's see, SOCOM, Fate Unlimited gets a price reduction, Densetsu no Yushin no Densetsu Legendary Saga comes out as well.

51:44.355 --> 51:46.697
[SPEAKER_06]: So a lot of little games here and there on the PSP this week.

51:46.837 --> 51:47.898
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

51:48.238 --> 51:49.459
[SPEAKER_06]: That does it for Japanese releases.

51:50.431 --> 51:52.332
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in the UK, we've got a small list.

51:52.372 --> 51:56.355
[SPEAKER_02]: We have on the 18th, Puzzle Chronicles on DS and PSP.

51:57.175 --> 52:10.643
[SPEAKER_02]: 19th, we have Ace Attorney Investigations, Miles Edgeworth, Aliens vs. Predator, Dynasty Warrior Strike Force Special, Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney, Justice for All, and Real Fishing Angler's Dream.

52:13.408 --> 52:14.310
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's it for me.

52:15.111 --> 52:23.764
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, just a few more stories for you guys and then we're going to get to the classic video game of the week because we just wouldn't have a show here at OLR if we couldn't have our classic game of the week.

52:24.004 --> 52:25.847
[SPEAKER_06]: But a few new stories first, Loki.

52:27.415 --> 52:44.290
[SPEAKER_07]: During an acceptance speech at the Japan Media Arts Festival, Miyamoto was referring to an unannounced Nintendo hardware and at least one new Wii project he's working on, which uses the Wii Motion Plus peripheral.

52:45.170 --> 53:14.237
[SPEAKER_07]: and of course he didn't make any formal announcements or anything like that but apparently there is something being worked on and I guess we'll just have to wait to find out what exactly that is but I'm not surprised that there's new hardware coming I would guess probably a new handheld I know, hasn't there just been rumblings and it seems like we've had stories little hints dropped by Nintendo for quite a while now there is some type of motion enabled DSi coming out or like a DS2 or something that's going to be dumb

53:16.115 --> 53:19.859
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the DS isn't a bad system.

53:19.879 --> 53:21.041
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just flooded with shovelware.

53:21.261 --> 53:26.827
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not saying it's dumb that they're putting out another system.

53:27.228 --> 53:31.092
[SPEAKER_07]: The reason why I'm saying that is because they just came out with the DSi a year ago.

53:31.112 --> 53:31.332
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

53:34.864 --> 53:38.245
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, think about when we were transitioning into the DS.

53:38.405 --> 53:41.306
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember the year we were there at E3, seeing the DS.

53:41.366 --> 53:44.487
[SPEAKER_06]: It was our first E3, the year they showed off the DS for the very first time.

53:44.907 --> 53:46.127
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember what else they were showing off?

53:46.547 --> 53:48.628
[SPEAKER_06]: The micro advances at the same time.

53:49.028 --> 53:53.229
[SPEAKER_06]: And there were people saying, well, who the hell would want to buy a micro advance when they just announced the DS?

53:53.669 --> 53:54.889
[SPEAKER_06]: But Jamie bought one.

53:55.369 --> 53:57.670
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not say that I bought one.

53:57.770 --> 53:58.250
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not.

53:58.310 --> 53:59.310
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry, Jamie.

53:59.531 --> 54:00.491
[SPEAKER_06]: Acquired one.

54:00.531 --> 54:01.171
[SPEAKER_06]: Acquired one.

54:01.331 --> 54:30.800
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, here's the difference though between that though, whereas the DSi is being treated as a new platform, I mean they are now starting to put out DSi exclusive games and then you know, they're going to probably slowly phase out the DS stuff I guess, I don't know why they would do that because they have so many right now, but to put out yet another hardware platform that's going to be a portable system that's kind of like, what the hell, I mean say you just bought a DSi you know, and it's got a, you know

54:31.420 --> 54:34.602
[SPEAKER_07]: It does have feature enhancements compared to the DS.

54:34.662 --> 54:38.965
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not just, look, we made it smaller, or look, we made it larger, or look, we made it purple.

54:39.245 --> 54:42.868
[SPEAKER_06]: A camera and memory storage or whatever the DSI had.

54:42.908 --> 54:44.589
[SPEAKER_06]: Memory storage, download service.

54:44.609 --> 54:45.750
[SPEAKER_06]: I never bothered with DSI.

54:45.950 --> 54:47.071
[SPEAKER_07]: I barely play my DS anymore.

54:47.091 --> 54:47.551
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, exactly.

54:47.831 --> 54:48.311
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't either.

54:48.391 --> 54:54.375
[SPEAKER_07]: But the thing is, if they're going to put out a motion-enabled platform as well that's not compatible with this...

54:55.856 --> 54:58.117
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, how many times are they going to get you to buy the DS?

54:59.058 --> 55:00.818
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I guess, how many times did you buy the Game Boy?

55:00.879 --> 55:08.362
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, hasn't every Nintendo handheld just been an evolution of the previous one of some sort, and they've all kind of been backwards compatible?

55:08.382 --> 55:11.183
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think at this point they're going to have to come out with something new, like new-new.

55:12.084 --> 55:13.584
[SPEAKER_07]: New hardware platform, period.

55:13.744 --> 55:14.725
[SPEAKER_06]: Still play DS carts.

55:15.045 --> 55:15.345
[SPEAKER_06]: It will.

55:17.126 --> 55:17.566
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fine.

55:18.086 --> 55:18.466
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

55:19.147 --> 55:19.727
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not buying it.

55:21.104 --> 55:23.605
[SPEAKER_07]: Telling you right now, I'm not paying for another handheld.

55:23.625 --> 55:27.448
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they're turning into Apple, where every year there'll be something bigger and better and newer.

55:30.049 --> 55:31.450
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not touching Apple stuff either.

55:32.611 --> 55:37.573
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well here's something maybe Loki could play that is for a Nintendo system, and I think this would be pretty exciting.

55:38.294 --> 55:46.959
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a game being developed by Epicenter, and they have combined the games Guitar Hero and Typing of the Dead.

55:47.959 --> 55:50.261
[SPEAKER_06]: to bring you Rock of the Dead.

55:51.021 --> 56:02.510
[SPEAKER_06]: So you use a rock band or guitar hero controller on your Wii and you use it to basically kill undead by playing different fret patterns or hitting different buttons on the guitar will allow you to kill zombies.

56:03.391 --> 56:08.194
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know if that sells you guys right there, but then they also go on to say they're serious.

56:08.554 --> 56:12.437
[SPEAKER_06]: They've brought in some like uber nerdy star tech power into this game.

56:13.138 --> 56:15.660
[SPEAKER_06]: Neil Patrick Harris will be the voice of the main character.

56:16.440 --> 56:18.642
[SPEAKER_06]: Felicia Day will also be doing a voice

56:36.435 --> 56:41.278
[SPEAKER_07]: is you basically have, you know, something that is knocking off House of the Dead.

56:41.699 --> 56:46.482
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, even knocking off Typing of the Dead instead of a keyboard, it's the fret buttons.

56:46.662 --> 56:48.143
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, there's going to be a lawsuit.

56:48.363 --> 57:03.313
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, seriously, the names are too, you know, if it was like, you know, Zombie Rock or something like that, you know, the names are too similar, the presentation's too similar, the gameplay's too similar, it's going to be, they're going to have a lawsuit.

57:03.593 --> 57:06.114
[SPEAKER_06]: You think Sega will sue to get the name changed?

57:06.674 --> 57:08.794
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Zombie Rock.

57:08.934 --> 57:12.575
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they will sue them because, let me put it this way, this company is putting this out as a conspiracy.

57:13.455 --> 57:14.075
[SPEAKER_07]: They're a nobody.

57:14.215 --> 57:17.556
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they're like a really small development house.

57:18.736 --> 57:19.257
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, though?

57:19.917 --> 57:22.057
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it when small studios have good ideas, though.

57:22.077 --> 57:23.858
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a good idea.

57:23.898 --> 57:25.378
[SPEAKER_07]: They just ripped someone else off.

57:25.618 --> 57:29.759
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, hey, typing dead would be awesome if I didn't have to find a keyboard and I could just use a guitar.

57:29.879 --> 57:30.179
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

57:30.199 --> 57:37.223
[SPEAKER_02]: But, though, I'll be honest that I had this discussion with someone about them doing another typing of the dead with a different peripheral.

57:37.583 --> 57:39.405
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I was thinking, you know, drumming of the dead.

57:40.105 --> 57:42.446
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to reiterate, Neil Patrick Harris is awesome.

57:42.947 --> 57:44.408
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, great for Neil Patrick Harris.

57:44.448 --> 57:46.269
[SPEAKER_07]: He needs, you know, money, too, to pay the bills.

57:46.349 --> 57:49.030
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm sorry, it's still a rip-off.

57:50.495 --> 57:58.961
[SPEAKER_07]: and there's nothing... I mean, it looks exactly like... If this Rock of the Dead came out and they didn't say who made it, who would you think made it?

57:59.281 --> 57:59.701
[SPEAKER_07]: Sega!

57:59.942 --> 58:01.603
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it sounds like House of the Dead.

58:01.623 --> 58:02.403
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like House of the Dead.

58:02.423 --> 58:03.984
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have said, yeah, Sega's getting funny.

58:04.365 --> 58:05.145
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, exactly.

58:05.385 --> 58:07.407
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's a rip-off.

58:07.507 --> 58:10.209
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sorry... It's kind of a bummer Sega didn't think of it.

58:11.505 --> 58:16.890
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a bummer, but at the same time, it probably won't make it out, at least not under that name.

58:16.950 --> 58:22.415
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give you the honest reason I'm not interested in this game, despite the voice talent behind it, is that I'm not buying a guitar for the Wii.

58:22.535 --> 58:23.075
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

58:23.916 --> 58:24.977
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have to borrow one.

58:25.197 --> 58:26.278
[SPEAKER_02]: Flailing.

58:26.358 --> 58:27.099
[SPEAKER_02]: I would totally play it.

58:27.579 --> 58:31.082
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought the Dreamcast keyboard for Typing of the Dead.

58:31.222 --> 58:34.545
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Typing of the Dead on Dreamcast, but I would totally play this too on the 360.

58:36.247 --> 58:37.148
[SPEAKER_06]: Flailing of the Dead.

58:39.781 --> 58:42.722
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, did you know that they have the air guitar controller?

58:43.842 --> 58:44.062
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

58:44.622 --> 58:45.542
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw one at Fry's.

58:45.962 --> 58:46.762
[SPEAKER_06]: Sitar of the Dead?

58:46.902 --> 58:49.503
[SPEAKER_12]: No, an air guitar controller.

58:49.723 --> 58:49.943
[SPEAKER_12]: I know.

58:50.423 --> 58:51.403
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy.

58:51.503 --> 58:58.485
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a great idea, more power to them if they're able to launch it without a lawsuit, but I mean, seriously.

58:58.885 --> 59:03.226
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to think, haven't there been like parody games before that were obvious play on titles?

59:03.266 --> 59:09.187
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, granted, there's Dawn of the Dead and stuff like that, Day of the Dead, whatever, but

59:10.448 --> 59:24.880
[SPEAKER_07]: House of the Dead A zombie shooter That had a version that wasn't with a light gun It was with a keyboard And you entered in commands And it killed the zombie This is basically the same thing Except it's a guitar controller And the movie sucked

59:25.160 --> 59:25.700
[SPEAKER_07]: Samba de la Muerta

59:53.396 --> 01:00:22.369
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna maraca the zombies to death I would play the hell out of that I would play the shit out of that game especially if Neil Patrick Harris did a voice you know what Rob maybe we should have that as a side to our LAN party have a maraca booty shaking contest going on in the other room I think Samba de la Muerte should be a dream game I don't know I'm thinking that's we should have that and of course Rod Caliber yeah but Rod Caliber has kind of already been done Samba de la Dead or whatever awesome

01:00:24.443 --> 01:00:26.125
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, boy oh boy.

01:00:26.305 --> 01:00:35.253
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let's take a different direction here in the show and take a look at gaming's past and take a trip down memory lane to figure out what the classic game of the week is.

01:00:36.174 --> 01:00:44.101
[SPEAKER_06]: Because every week, DarkSakura likes to take a trip to the vault and find a game that she says, hey, you ungrateful kids, you ought to be playing this game.

01:00:44.121 --> 01:00:46.503
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, she picked something from the ColecoVision this week, right?

01:00:46.684 --> 01:00:46.844
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

01:00:47.004 --> 01:00:47.264
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

01:00:47.404 --> 01:00:47.945
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe next week.

01:00:48.245 --> 01:00:49.566
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, get off my lawn.

01:00:50.547 --> 01:00:56.410
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, she said get off my lawn and then decided Go play this This should be the classic game of the week So what is your classic game of the week, DarkSakura?

01:00:56.650 --> 01:01:01.833
[SPEAKER_06]: Doom Doom is the classic game of the week

01:01:02.406 --> 01:01:04.568
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

01:01:23.042 --> 01:01:29.947
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, IDDQD was, I think, God Mode, and then ID Level Skip, and then ID BFG for all the weapons and crap.

01:01:30.148 --> 01:01:33.650
[SPEAKER_07]: No, BFG, that was just the big fucking gun.

01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:34.291
[SPEAKER_02]: The big fucking gun.

01:01:34.431 --> 01:01:35.071
[SPEAKER_07]: KFA.

01:01:35.351 --> 01:01:35.852
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it.

01:01:38.050 --> 01:01:39.011
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:01:55.306 --> 01:02:05.753
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there were also, um, this gave us a term that we had before the coining of, you know, first person shooter, I really think.

01:02:05.993 --> 01:02:07.254
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was Doom Clone.

01:02:07.414 --> 01:02:10.957
[SPEAKER_02]: How often did we use the term Doom Clone back in the day?

01:02:12.483 --> 01:02:15.567
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yes, there were tons of Doom knockoff games though, tons.

01:02:15.887 --> 01:02:20.212
[SPEAKER_02]: But from there we had Doom 2 Hell on Earth, and by the way the first Doom came out in 93.

01:02:20.272 --> 01:02:23.856
[SPEAKER_02]: Doom 2 was 1994, Ultimate Doom 1995, Master Levels for Doom 2, Final Doom in 1996.

01:02:24.276 --> 01:02:25.297
[SPEAKER_02]: Even Doom was copying Doom.

01:02:32.165 --> 01:02:46.015
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but now there's also Doom Resurrection that came out last year in June for the iPhone, which I haven't played, but it's a parallel to Doom 3.

01:02:47.617 --> 01:02:52.620
[SPEAKER_02]: Doom 4 was stated for being in production, but there's nothing out on it yet.

01:02:54.001 --> 01:02:55.903
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's first person.

01:02:55.943 --> 01:02:57.444
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get a chainsaw.

01:02:57.764 --> 01:02:58.745
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get the BFG.

01:03:02.066 --> 01:03:07.070
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you can, um, there's just all kinds of, like, weird stuff also hidden in the game, too.

01:03:07.930 --> 01:03:16.336
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, like in, uh, Doom 2, you have a bunny called Daisy that's, you know, impaled on a stake, and you have to give vengeance for it and crap.

01:03:18.097 --> 01:03:18.918
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um...

01:03:20.538 --> 01:03:22.860
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, basically, it's just going through.

01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:31.445
[SPEAKER_02]: If you play it on the weakest level and then you try to get through to the last level, it doesn't let you play the last level.

01:03:31.505 --> 01:03:41.031
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, the screen goes black like you're... But the reason why I'm bringing up Doom is because of the...

01:03:42.992 --> 01:03:45.673
[SPEAKER_02]: The home hacks, the wads.

01:03:46.713 --> 01:03:47.994
[SPEAKER_02]: All kinds of different versions.

01:03:48.114 --> 01:03:50.014
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's a Ghostbusters one.

01:03:50.895 --> 01:03:52.915
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a Gatchaman one.

01:03:53.135 --> 01:03:54.676
[SPEAKER_02]: Aliens, Sailor Moon.

01:03:54.836 --> 01:03:57.116
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the Dragon Ball Z one back in the day.

01:03:58.037 --> 01:04:02.598
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all these people who would just go and, you know, change out the sprites and everything.

01:04:02.658 --> 01:04:08.600
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, also, also, the other thing was skipping to the hidden Wolfenstein level.

01:04:09.762 --> 01:04:15.625
[SPEAKER_06]: Wolfenstein was the game I would mod, not so much Doom, but I had the Mortal Kombat characters for Wolfenstein.

01:04:15.645 --> 01:04:17.546
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a lot of fun.

01:04:17.606 --> 01:04:22.169
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I prefer them for Quake, but we had Doom first.

01:04:23.770 --> 01:04:33.435
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that Doom is really the reason why we've got just the massive tons of first-person shooters that we have today.

01:04:33.695 --> 01:04:35.836
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of want to play this on Xbox Live later.

01:04:36.056 --> 01:04:38.517
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I want to have an epic frag fest on Doom later.

01:04:38.857 --> 01:04:43.279
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to play... This is actually the one... This video is from Ultimate Doom.

01:04:44.219 --> 01:04:51.882
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, I played quite a bit of it on the Nintendo 64, but really... This was the game I learned my appreciation for PC gaming on.

01:04:51.902 --> 01:04:55.684
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was from this that I was playing Duke Nukem 3D.

01:04:56.704 --> 01:04:58.965
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, where you could do your own voice macros and everything.

01:04:59.205 --> 01:05:01.826
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was the game I learned to do deathmatching on.

01:05:02.867 --> 01:05:03.147
[SPEAKER_02]: You know...

01:05:04.007 --> 01:05:07.209
[SPEAKER_02]: On top of that, I can play Doom without getting motion sick.

01:05:08.430 --> 01:05:08.770
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:10.351
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's sprite-based.

01:05:11.391 --> 01:05:11.892
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's right.

01:05:11.912 --> 01:05:16.134
[SPEAKER_06]: You have the whole, like, sprites don't make you sick, but the real 3D rendering.

01:05:16.154 --> 01:05:17.255
[SPEAKER_02]: But polygons do.

01:05:17.415 --> 01:05:17.835
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

01:05:18.823 --> 01:05:19.464
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:05:35.505 --> 01:05:48.031
[SPEAKER_02]: And going to hang out, this was, no I take that back, 94, my first year of college And going to hang out at my friend Marcy's house playing Doom Playing Doom and Phantasmagoria Do you remember that game?

01:05:48.191 --> 01:06:02.578
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Phantasmagoria just came out on the Good Old Games website this week I don't think it's in tonight's show roll, or I don't remember if we talked about it last week But Phantasmagoria, old is new again Yeah, but you know, we were playing this in Loom, I was playing Loom when I was playing Doom

01:06:03.675 --> 01:06:05.116
[SPEAKER_06]: I played a crap load of Doom.

01:06:05.156 --> 01:06:10.180
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I used to call into a BBS that specialized in doing the Doom 2 networking.

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:12.902
[SPEAKER_06]: So you would call into this BBS and you'd do these settings.

01:06:12.922 --> 01:06:13.943
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even remember what you had to do.

01:06:13.963 --> 01:06:14.623
[SPEAKER_06]: It was so long ago.

01:06:14.844 --> 01:06:16.945
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you'd launch Doom 2 and you could actually play.

01:06:17.265 --> 01:06:19.167
[SPEAKER_06]: And this BBS would charge.

01:06:19.187 --> 01:06:22.169
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd get an hour free and then you had to pay for more hours.

01:06:22.469 --> 01:06:26.613
[SPEAKER_06]: So of course we'd keep re-registering new accounts and putting in fake phone numbers and stuff.

01:06:26.653 --> 01:06:26.893
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:06:27.313 --> 01:06:49.802
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll tell you, you know, that same year of school, we had our Mac Lab, and keep in mind, it was the old, you know, the big rectangle box, tall Macs with the crappy keyboards and shit, and mine had a black and white version of Doom on it.

01:06:51.132 --> 01:06:55.633
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so I was playing Doom in black and white in class and getting a D in the class.

01:06:55.933 --> 01:07:00.595
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a great game of the week because I think especially for you younger folks out there to listen to the show.

01:07:00.635 --> 01:07:05.436
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I know even though we swear a lot more than we should on this show and so kids should listen to our show.

01:07:05.816 --> 01:07:09.097
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's some of you in like that 16 to 17 range that listen to this program.

01:07:09.517 --> 01:07:15.219
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're one of those folks, if you want to see what gaming was like when we were 16, I mean not to be all like...

01:07:16.059 --> 01:07:18.081
[SPEAKER_06]: I walked uphill back where I was.

01:07:18.101 --> 01:07:18.801
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's face it.

01:07:18.821 --> 01:07:19.682
[SPEAKER_12]: I walked uphill both ways.

01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:21.843
[SPEAKER_06]: We're getting old because we've been doing this show for eight years.

01:07:21.863 --> 01:07:22.884
[SPEAKER_02]: Speak for yourself.

01:07:23.505 --> 01:07:24.345
[SPEAKER_02]: I still get carded.

01:07:24.485 --> 01:07:26.066
[SPEAKER_06]: This was the game I would play when I was 16.

01:07:26.887 --> 01:07:31.851
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to see a real game that we grew up on and loved, Doom is a great example.

01:07:31.931 --> 01:07:35.733
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're making me feel old because I was in college when I was playing Doom.

01:07:36.254 --> 01:07:38.015
[SPEAKER_02]: Doom came out when I was in 11th grade.

01:07:38.475 --> 01:07:38.675
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:07:38.796 --> 01:07:42.458
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was playing it more when I was out of... It aged.

01:07:42.478 --> 01:07:43.119
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have... I had an...

01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:49.463
[SPEAKER_02]: My computer that I had was a TI and I had a Clico Atom.

01:07:50.324 --> 01:07:52.165
[SPEAKER_02]: I would use the school's Apple IIe.

01:07:52.305 --> 01:07:59.330
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have my own computer until, you know, at least a regular use computer until Light 95 and I was on AOL 1.5 on DOS.

01:08:02.432 --> 01:08:03.994
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to read this in chat real quick.

01:08:04.054 --> 01:08:05.956
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob D's commenting on what I said there.

01:08:06.016 --> 01:08:08.719
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm almost 23, but I played all this stuff when I was younger.

01:08:08.839 --> 01:08:11.042
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he links a screenshot from ZZT.

01:08:11.362 --> 01:08:15.287
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to take a moment to say hail ZZT, one of the greatest PC games of all freaking time.

01:08:15.707 --> 01:08:16.168
[SPEAKER_06]: We miss you.

01:08:17.938 --> 01:08:43.531
[SPEAKER_02]: but I do have to make a mention of it that Doom is actually one of the games that led up to one of my favorite wads and it wasn't it actually wasn't Doom but it was a Quake one but I first played a version of it on Doom and then found a much better one for Quake was Gacha Quake which was a full on fully redone Gachamon Quake

01:08:45.012 --> 01:08:54.196
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, Doom was like my thing Doom is awesome Yeah, for anyone who hasn't played it God, what planet have you been living on?

01:08:54.757 --> 01:09:12.405
[SPEAKER_06]: Bochikawa in our chatroom says Doom is seriously one of the best games to have lasted for this long Wow And like I was saying before And it even had a crappy movie If you are one of those younger folks that didn't get to experience this when you were a teen or whatever Seriously, go on Xbox Live and check it out

01:09:12.645 --> 01:09:13.145
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:09:37.422 --> 01:09:40.104
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a challenge then.

01:09:40.144 --> 01:09:41.945
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go ahead and revive the Doomwad.

01:09:42.766 --> 01:09:44.007
[SPEAKER_02]: Doomwad, that's great.

01:09:44.767 --> 01:09:46.308
[SPEAKER_02]: I want someone to make OLR Doom.

01:09:46.428 --> 01:09:47.029
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck.

01:09:47.049 --> 01:09:48.950
[SPEAKER_02]: Those things take a lot of work.

01:09:49.871 --> 01:09:51.572
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone made us a text-based game.

01:09:51.812 --> 01:09:52.293
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

01:09:52.413 --> 01:09:53.754
[SPEAKER_02]: We can have an OLR Doom.

01:09:53.894 --> 01:09:55.035
[SPEAKER_06]: I want OLR Doom.

01:09:55.055 --> 01:09:56.376
[SPEAKER_06]: The text game was pretty awesome.

01:09:56.816 --> 01:09:57.576
[SPEAKER_02]: OLR Doom.

01:09:58.877 --> 01:09:59.237
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it.

01:09:59.257 --> 01:10:02.438
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I want to see my face melting and getting shot.

01:10:02.478 --> 01:10:03.759
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we don't use our faces.

01:10:03.919 --> 01:10:04.619
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be themed.

01:10:04.639 --> 01:10:06.220
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to be the ones with the gun.

01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:09.561
[SPEAKER_02]: We're the ones with the gun, and whoever wins gets a hat homemade by me.

01:10:09.922 --> 01:10:10.142
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

01:10:10.622 --> 01:10:12.743
[SPEAKER_06]: And you guys know who the various enemies of OLR are.

01:10:12.863 --> 01:10:14.904
[SPEAKER_06]: You can put them in there.

01:10:14.924 --> 01:10:18.085
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Ken Kudragi will be in there with a bicycle helmet and crayons.

01:10:22.341 --> 01:10:24.624
[SPEAKER_06]: Some folks in chat saying, oh, Zen Thrall Zen, there it is.

01:10:24.744 --> 01:10:25.926
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Rob, I've tried.

01:10:25.986 --> 01:10:27.188
[SPEAKER_06]: I was hoping for the same thing.

01:10:28.109 --> 01:10:28.409
[SPEAKER_06]: Fail.

01:10:29.531 --> 01:10:32.095
[SPEAKER_06]: So sadly, you cannot do the keyboard on Xbox Arcade.

01:10:33.052 --> 01:10:36.174
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so that's going to do it for the Classic Game of the Week, but that was a darn good one.

01:10:36.554 --> 01:10:36.934
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job.

01:10:37.875 --> 01:10:39.596
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I'm awesome.

01:10:39.676 --> 01:10:43.378
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to take a quick break here at OLR Headquarters, but don't go anywhere.

01:10:43.418 --> 01:10:56.145
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be right back with Part B, a lot of quick news tonight in Part B, as well as some news about another video game movie, Sonic 4, more details, Blur, a racing game I'm looking forward to, and a few more details on Game Room.

01:10:56.185 --> 01:10:59.447
[SPEAKER_06]: And are we looking at Wii's being hard to find all over again?

01:10:59.687 --> 01:11:01.875
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to talk about that in part B. So don't go anywhere.

01:11:01.935 --> 01:11:05.268
[SPEAKER_06]: We will be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:11:11.753 --> 01:11:17.639
[SPEAKER_06]: And welcome back everybody to more of Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday night, February the 14th of 2009.

01:11:17.719 --> 01:11:21.744
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time for part B of our episode number 355.

01:11:22.264 --> 01:11:29.692
[SPEAKER_06]: During the break there, we were playing some classic 8-bit songs and unfortunately you don't hear our break music on the podcast because, you know, copyright issues and all that.

01:11:30.072 --> 01:11:55.588
[SPEAKER_06]: but um we were playing some 8-bit songs for our uh chatters and they were kind of guessing and we had some uh let me let me just quickly name you the playlist we had because you know they're only about a minute long the NES songs were weren't that long so we did a lot of them we did a Battle of Olympus, Dr. Mario, Guardian Legend, Fashanadu, uh Kid Icarus, Crystallis, Goonies 2, Balloon Fight and then what I thought was a really tricky one Magic of Scheherazade, the town music that was a old school NES game I really liked it was kind of like

01:11:56.168 --> 01:12:23.608
[SPEAKER_06]: Zelda and an RPG like mixed together it was weird and then of course Metroid we had some requests in chat like I think some folks want to hear StarTropics and I saw a shout out for DuckTales too we'll try to get those at the end for our live listeners unfortunately you guys who are listening to us in the podcast we for copyright reasons can't do that although what I can do I can I can play the music and then talk over it so that's this is the magic of Scheherazade music and then I want to play like a little clip there so there you go

01:12:24.428 --> 01:12:25.309
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone remember that game?

01:12:25.449 --> 01:12:25.710
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone?

01:12:26.150 --> 01:12:26.390
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone?

01:12:26.791 --> 01:12:27.451
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone remember playing it?

01:12:28.052 --> 01:12:30.074
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, that's not even on virtual console.

01:12:30.594 --> 01:12:34.238
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the developer who made that game probably doesn't exist anymore.

01:12:34.258 --> 01:12:35.179
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't even remember who made that.

01:12:35.199 --> 01:12:36.180
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that the Culture Brain?

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:37.701
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't even remember.

01:12:37.981 --> 01:12:45.328
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyhow, let's get into some rapid fire news tonight and then we're going to get into Twitter topics as well.

01:12:46.189 --> 01:12:48.171
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag coming up this segment as well.

01:12:48.231 --> 01:12:48.912
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, start us off.

01:12:49.432 --> 01:12:50.793
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you like free stuff?

01:12:50.893 --> 01:12:53.253
[SPEAKER_07]: Because everybody does.

01:12:53.514 --> 01:12:53.814
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

01:12:53.994 --> 01:12:54.734
[SPEAKER_07]: I like free stuff.

01:12:55.374 --> 01:13:01.476
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the things that you can look forward to free is the old Command & Conquer games.

01:13:01.596 --> 01:13:02.137
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

01:13:02.297 --> 01:13:07.158
[SPEAKER_07]: EA is now offering Command & Conquer Classics, which are free to download.

01:13:07.879 --> 01:13:10.800
[SPEAKER_07]: And they are including...

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:17.464
[SPEAKER_07]: Tiberium Dawn, Tiberium Sun with the Firestorm expansion pack, and my personal favorite, Red Alert.

01:13:18.725 --> 01:13:28.191
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, I guess apparently they are easy to download, but to get them running with your modern computers, it may be a little bit tricky.

01:13:28.992 --> 01:13:31.033
[SPEAKER_07]: So keep that in mind.

01:13:31.533 --> 01:13:40.499
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're looking to download those, apparently Big Download is the website that will have those available.

01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:48.465
[SPEAKER_07]: BigDownload.com Some other cool stuff, of course, the LEGO Star Wars games, very popular.

01:13:48.805 --> 01:13:51.107
[SPEAKER_07]: And you may be thinking, hey, what's going to happen?

01:13:51.147 --> 01:13:52.788
[SPEAKER_07]: And what are they going to do for the third one?

01:13:52.828 --> 01:13:56.971
[SPEAKER_07]: Since obviously they've ran out of the Star Wars movies.

01:13:57.011 --> 01:14:02.255
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, not exactly, because the third LEGO Star Wars game will actually follow the Clone Wars.

01:14:03.156 --> 01:14:05.798
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm assuming the movie and maybe the TV series.

01:14:06.238 --> 01:14:13.761
[SPEAKER_07]: It's scheduled to come out later this year, probably in the fall, just in time for holidays, and on all your favorite platforms except for the PlayStation 2.

01:14:14.941 --> 01:14:20.123
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're seeing some brand new battle modes, also some head-to-head combat as well.

01:14:20.883 --> 01:14:25.885
[SPEAKER_07]: The level editor from Indiana Jones 2 will be coming back as well.

01:14:26.725 --> 01:14:33.127
[SPEAKER_07]: And just some new squad commands, lightsaber slicing, lightsaber jumps.

01:14:33.767 --> 01:14:37.410
[SPEAKER_07]: Long Distance Jedi Attacks, and Grapple Tie-Ups and whatnot.

01:14:38.471 --> 01:14:39.172
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of cool.

01:14:40.132 --> 01:14:43.655
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though I'm not really a fan of the Clone Wars series.

01:14:44.216 --> 01:14:44.456
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh well.

01:14:45.357 --> 01:14:47.338
[SPEAKER_07]: And then finally, L.A.

01:14:47.418 --> 01:14:55.585
[SPEAKER_07]: Noire, a game that is coming from Rockstar, will be making its way out this year in September.

01:14:55.925 --> 01:14:58.548
[SPEAKER_07]: It is, of course, kind of a crime drama game.

01:14:59.649 --> 01:15:10.902
[SPEAKER_07]: brought to you by the folks that put out Grand Theft Auto and what once was a PlayStation 3 exclusive is now of course coming out on both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:14.781
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that is it.

01:15:42.797 --> 01:15:43.817
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, how do you know this for sure?

01:15:44.097 --> 01:15:50.079
[SPEAKER_06]: Because this is somewhat of a bombshell to be dropping and part B of our show, which a lot of people probably don't listen long enough to get to.

01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:53.600
[SPEAKER_07]: Just listening from Square.

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:56.801
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm sure they'll announce it soon at some point.

01:15:57.142 --> 01:15:58.962
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know when the game's coming out right now.

01:15:59.002 --> 01:16:05.124
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still scheduled around... Do you think or do you have anything that indicates to you that it's going to be simultaneous with PS3?

01:16:05.144 --> 01:16:06.564
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be the same time.

01:16:07.065 --> 01:16:07.865
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be the same time.

01:16:08.625 --> 01:16:15.227
[SPEAKER_07]: but right now it's all kind of we don't even know exactly for sure when it's coming out.

01:16:16.667 --> 01:16:19.968
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now it's kind of hovering around June but that stuff gets delayed all the time.

01:16:20.228 --> 01:16:23.389
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a nice little bombshell to tuck there in rapid fire news.

01:16:23.449 --> 01:16:34.092
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's just because we were talking about exclusives so I mean I don't know, it makes sense because they're going to sell a hell of a lot of Final Fantasy XIII on 360 so I'm not surprised.

01:16:34.918 --> 01:16:37.841
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, gee, it makes my iPhone stories look a little silly, but I'll try.

01:16:54.981 --> 01:16:55.541
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:17:14.747 --> 01:17:17.208
[SPEAKER_06]: Apogee's Rise of the Triad is coming to the iPhone.

01:17:33.936 --> 01:18:02.956
[SPEAKER_06]: and also big bombshell on the iPhone Plants vs. Zombies because Pop Crack, you know they put out a lot of addicting games Plants vs. Zombies has a date which seems strange because Apple games don't usually get dated because it's just kind of you're at Apple's mercy but for whatever reason PopCap has said it is coming out on the handheld February 15th that would be tomorrow or if you're listening on the podcast probably today or yesterday so Plants vs. Zombies on February 15th on the iPhone

01:18:03.896 --> 01:18:04.657
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go, DarkSakra.

01:18:16.918 --> 01:18:19.819
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, that perhaps Dudley will be in Street Fighter 4.

01:18:19.959 --> 01:18:22.000
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Super Street Fighter 4, I should say.

01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:24.861
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be pretty cool.

01:18:25.541 --> 01:18:27.222
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though I never used him and thought he sucked.

01:18:27.742 --> 01:18:29.662
[SPEAKER_02]: Although people are infuriating using him.

01:18:30.683 --> 01:18:34.884
[SPEAKER_02]: Mega Man 10 will have a March release.

01:18:37.925 --> 01:18:39.766
[SPEAKER_02]: We will have it after...

01:18:42.507 --> 01:18:48.530
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, the WiiWare version will be March 1st, PlayStation 3 will be March 11th, and Xbox 360 will be March 31st.

01:18:49.651 --> 01:18:55.654
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, in that batch, Rock Band is going to be getting some new tracks.

01:18:56.515 --> 01:19:01.878
[SPEAKER_02]: An Otis Redding track pack, which is Sitting on the Dock of the Bay, the fa-fa-fa-fa-fa sad song.

01:19:02.618 --> 01:19:18.865
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sick y'all I got dreams to remember and love man and then some individual tracks all time low weightless alpha beat fascination buyer sets orchestra stray cat strut that's such a cool song and the chemical brothers let forever be and they're also available for lego rock band

01:19:20.791 --> 01:19:23.272
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, how about some Twitter topics then?

01:19:23.312 --> 01:19:27.795
[SPEAKER_06]: If we're all done with the rapid fire stuff tonight, let's get into some Twitter topics.

01:19:27.935 --> 01:19:35.599
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, our computer is acting up right now and I can't even access the theme music because it's being rude.

01:19:36.419 --> 01:19:38.060
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if our feed just went down.

01:19:40.401 --> 01:19:41.162
[SPEAKER_06]: We did go down.

01:19:42.102 --> 01:19:42.642
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we down?

01:19:43.603 --> 01:19:44.083
[SPEAKER_06]: We're down.

01:19:44.123 --> 01:19:45.044
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, hold on guys.

01:19:45.464 --> 01:19:49.426
[SPEAKER_06]: Those of you listening on the podcast, we need to go ahead and just bring our feed right back up.

01:19:56.266 --> 01:19:56.906
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we're back.

01:19:56.947 --> 01:20:01.229
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a little bit of a live stream difficulty there, so we lost all of our listeners there for a minute.

01:20:01.389 --> 01:20:04.011
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why, but Winamp decided to crash on us.

01:20:04.552 --> 01:20:09.915
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's kind of an important program when we're trying to broadcast, because we use Shoutcast to send our feed over to the all-game servers.

01:20:10.295 --> 01:20:18.761
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we left off with the show, Jamie had just finished up her last little rapid-fire stories, talking about the Rock Band releases for the week.

01:20:18.801 --> 01:20:22.684
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if our live listeners got to hear that, but we know it's saved for the podcast.

01:20:23.024 --> 01:20:26.006
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to move on now and move into some Twitter topics.

01:20:30.108 --> 01:20:47.215
[SPEAKER_06]: of course every week we invite your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR we got a lot tonight so I apologize if I don't get to your tweet but we just have kind of a lot tonight so especially if you sent multiple tweets probably only going to read one okay TigerClaw305 sends us a tweet that says game teaches

01:20:48.445 --> 01:20:50.686
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know if I should say this with a child in the room.

01:20:52.467 --> 01:20:56.690
[SPEAKER_06]: Game teaches S-E-X through the eyes of a superhero.

01:20:57.070 --> 01:21:04.274
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, Jillian would walk into the room right as I'm starting to read this story here.

01:21:05.495 --> 01:21:05.795
[SPEAKER_06]: Awkward.

01:21:06.395 --> 01:21:09.519
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so a game teaches SEX through the eyes of a superhero.

01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:22.093
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently health officials in Ontario, Canada, are talking about a new video game launched Thursday that will help teenagers learn about sex through the eyes of a superhero.

01:21:22.133 --> 01:21:22.914
[SPEAKER_06]: He left the room, it's okay.

01:21:23.655 --> 01:21:27.680
[SPEAKER_06]: This is an online game, ironically, by the Middlesex London Health Unit.

01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:32.505
[SPEAKER_06]: It gets a player to choose a character and answer true or false questions about their activity.

01:21:33.086 --> 01:21:38.853
[SPEAKER_06]: You can either be a man named Captain Condom, a virgin named Wonder Badge,

01:21:39.654 --> 01:21:46.377
[SPEAKER_06]: or a boy named Willie the Kid who believes size doesn't matter or PowerPap, a sexually active gal.

01:21:47.118 --> 01:21:48.759
[SPEAKER_06]: This is worth it just for the names alone.

01:21:49.459 --> 01:21:58.023
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to fight the game's supervillain, the Sperminator, who's a muscular man wearing a red wrestling mask with, of course, penis arms, by correctly answering a number of questions.

01:21:58.063 --> 01:22:00.484
[SPEAKER_06]: If you get an answer wrong, you get shot by sperm.

01:22:00.524 --> 01:22:02.125
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell kind of game is this?

01:22:02.145 --> 01:22:03.486
[SPEAKER_06]: The tiger called Link to us.

01:22:03.826 --> 01:22:05.227
[SPEAKER_06]: This is disgusting.

01:22:07.428 --> 01:22:09.791
[SPEAKER_06]: www.getitonlondon.com

01:22:26.286 --> 01:22:27.086
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:22:52.619 --> 01:22:54.040
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100, Matt linked us to this.

01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:58.882
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if any of you guys saw that new We Are The World video for the 25th anniversary or whatever.

01:22:59.022 --> 01:22:59.522
[SPEAKER_06]: Refuse.

01:23:00.023 --> 01:23:01.383
[SPEAKER_06]: It was awful.

01:23:01.663 --> 01:23:03.024
[SPEAKER_06]: It is awful.

01:23:03.104 --> 01:23:14.849
[SPEAKER_06]: Michael Jackson, seriously, if I were him, I would rise from the grave and slap, who's that guy, Lil Wayne or whatever, in the face for using auto-tune in a disgusting way on that song.

01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:16.510
[SPEAKER_05]: He used auto-tune on that song?

01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:17.451
[SPEAKER_06]: It was bad.

01:23:18.371 --> 01:23:19.893
[SPEAKER_06]: and just, it is bad.

01:23:20.253 --> 01:23:21.074
[SPEAKER_06]: It was so bad.

01:23:21.174 --> 01:23:22.435
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we just know he can't sing.

01:23:22.455 --> 01:23:22.895
[SPEAKER_06]: It was so bad.

01:23:22.915 --> 01:23:23.636
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, seriously?

01:23:24.036 --> 01:23:28.821
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I'm all for, you know, supporting charities and all that, but don't do it through this organization.

01:23:29.141 --> 01:23:33.205
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, just donate to the Red Cross or donate to one of the Haiti relief organizations.

01:23:33.465 --> 01:23:36.468
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't make these celebrities think they actually helped because they didn't.

01:23:37.089 --> 01:23:37.950
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my take on it.

01:23:37.970 --> 01:23:38.370
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

01:23:38.450 --> 01:23:43.415
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually did buy the Haiti, Help Haiti, whatever.

01:23:43.675 --> 01:23:46.376
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I did the little text message too when they did the telethon and so forth.

01:23:46.737 --> 01:23:48.678
[SPEAKER_02]: I downloaded the album on Amazon.

01:23:48.698 --> 01:23:49.278
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

01:23:49.598 --> 01:23:54.260
[SPEAKER_02]: And Shakira is not allowed to cover The Pretenders ever.

01:23:56.141 --> 01:23:56.442
[SPEAKER_06]: Never.

01:23:56.782 --> 01:24:00.303
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, SSJ100Matt didn't want us to just talk about that.

01:24:00.344 --> 01:24:05.106
[SPEAKER_06]: They wanted us to mention that somebody in the video, and you can't really see who because it's obscured, but it's circled here.

01:24:05.126 --> 01:24:08.408
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this is actually because they're showing clips of, I believe, this is Haiti at this point.

01:24:08.728 --> 01:24:10.969
[SPEAKER_06]: You actually can see somebody's wearing a Fatal Fury hat.

01:24:12.930 --> 01:24:15.192
[SPEAKER_06]: Rock Band DLC will be more selective in the future.

01:24:33.127 --> 01:24:53.520
[SPEAKER_06]: hmm so apparently they're going to start to scale back maybe some of the stuff that you know because they put a lot of stuff on there maybe they're just finally realizing they're not selling as much as they used to and that there's a lot of tracks that maybe just aren't worthy of being on rock band maybe because they have the rock band network now they can kind of screen through a lot of stuff I don't know

01:24:54.986 --> 01:24:55.306
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

01:24:55.987 --> 01:25:00.490
[SPEAKER_06]: Master of the Claw linked us to a YouTube, but I can't pull it up in studio because it'll be too quick here.

01:25:00.770 --> 01:25:02.651
[SPEAKER_06]: But it says this relates to Typing of the Dead.

01:25:02.671 --> 01:25:05.733
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently there was a PC guitar battling game from 1995, but it is a short clip.

01:25:09.083 --> 01:25:16.305
[SPEAKER_06]: And then lastly here from Spazinator, PSN, which is better, local or online multiplayer?

01:25:16.526 --> 01:25:20.347
[SPEAKER_06]: I say online for one reason, the no pants rule, LOL.

01:25:21.307 --> 01:25:23.508
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't know, Loki, what do you think?

01:25:23.588 --> 01:25:25.448
[SPEAKER_06]: Is local or online gaming better?

01:25:25.788 --> 01:25:27.129
[SPEAKER_06]: I would prefer local.

01:25:27.549 --> 01:25:28.310
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

01:25:43.493 --> 01:26:03.256
[SPEAKER_07]: and we found out why our network is so laggy it's because we have these wonderful or I should say it was a wonderful use of company money we have these photo frames on all of our desks that pull pictures off of a website that have little event pictures from our work and stuff the web shots

01:26:03.656 --> 01:26:06.437
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and they all suck bandwidth.

01:26:07.058 --> 01:26:12.900
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we have like Xbox Live disconnects all the freaking time just from those stupid things.

01:26:13.060 --> 01:26:14.001
[SPEAKER_07]: Thankfully, they're fixing it.

01:26:14.441 --> 01:26:19.543
[SPEAKER_07]: But still, you know, that's why I do like System Link for that kind of stuff.

01:26:19.584 --> 01:26:24.306
[SPEAKER_07]: And I kind of wish Grand Theft Auto had System Link because if that was the case, we'd be still playing our modded games.

01:26:25.206 --> 01:26:30.290
[SPEAKER_06]: I prefer local multiplayer, but I really like online multiplayer when local multiplayer is impossible.

01:26:31.190 --> 01:26:38.575
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, I think I've said this on the show before, my boyfriend lives two hours away, so during the week we can't really just drive out and see each other one night.

01:26:38.915 --> 01:26:46.721
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the weekends we'll play Castle Crashers or something together, but during the week we play WoW online.

01:26:46.781 --> 01:26:50.623
[SPEAKER_06]: So I like online gaming for when in real life it's impossible.

01:26:52.745 --> 01:26:53.145
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

01:26:53.185 --> 01:26:54.686
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the last question for tonight.

01:26:55.446 --> 01:27:23.152
[SPEAKER_06]: more Twitter topics next week at twitter.com slash OLR let's get back into some more news stories we'll start off with Loki yes I'm sorry can I throw this out here real quick I'm sorry Actdeft wanted to append his tweet saying that the Rock Band article goes on to talk about how the fees that the record labels are charging for the music being on Rock Band is probably leading to them being more selective which if the record companies are going to get greedy with what ends up being promotion for their own stuff

01:27:24.492 --> 01:27:26.414
[SPEAKER_06]: I say let him get what's coming to him.

01:27:27.175 --> 01:27:28.516
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is Rock Band turning him down.

01:27:30.258 --> 01:27:30.879
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, sorry, Loki.

01:27:31.199 --> 01:27:32.501
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all right.

01:27:33.722 --> 01:27:39.808
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's hard to believe that even though the Wii's been out for almost three years now that...

01:27:41.710 --> 01:27:43.271
[SPEAKER_07]: There's still shortages, apparently.

01:27:43.872 --> 01:27:48.937
[SPEAKER_07]: And some of the retailers are saying that the demand is still outpacing the supply.

01:27:49.657 --> 01:27:58.065
[SPEAKER_07]: And a bunch of different retailers, including GameStop, Amazon, and Newegg, have all been having issues keeping the wheat in stock.

01:27:58.245 --> 01:28:03.550
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently, orders from Nintendo are just not coming in in a timely manner.

01:28:04.111 --> 01:28:05.932
[SPEAKER_07]: And Nintendo is saying, well...

01:28:06.593 --> 01:28:11.456
[SPEAKER_07]: The replenishing the Wii supply will be a challenge.

01:28:11.516 --> 01:28:23.523
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, in the short term, replenishing the Wii inventories will be a challenge, but we're doing everything we can to satisfy consumers looking for Wii to purchase.

01:28:26.445 --> 01:28:40.292
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, I guess December, it was thought that Nintendo had actually reduced Wii production going into the holiday, is from a report in December.

01:28:41.032 --> 01:28:45.295
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you see, here's the problem I have with this, is that...

01:28:46.635 --> 01:28:50.678
[SPEAKER_07]: They always say, oh, we're having trouble making the Wii's and stuff like that.

01:28:51.459 --> 01:28:52.700
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:54.061
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like three years later.

01:28:54.121 --> 01:28:54.962
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't buy it either.

01:28:55.002 --> 01:29:00.366
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not believing that any of those shortages from before are even... I think they were all manufactured.

01:29:00.446 --> 01:29:01.706
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, this is a shortage now.

01:29:01.987 --> 01:29:03.548
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't put out a console.

01:29:04.348 --> 01:29:08.031
[SPEAKER_07]: Why aren't you putting out tons and tons and tons of consoles out there in the market?

01:29:08.071 --> 01:29:08.331
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

01:29:09.332 --> 01:29:12.740
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you afraid that people are just going to find them everywhere and now they're not going to want them?

01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:14.864
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't understand.

01:29:14.904 --> 01:29:18.351
[SPEAKER_07]: If your console is that good, then what's the problem with having a good supply of them?

01:29:19.682 --> 01:29:23.545
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I know, because you need to create this artificial shortage so everyone scrambles for them.

01:29:23.845 --> 01:29:25.907
[SPEAKER_06]: Something's up, too, and I'm calling them on it.

01:29:26.147 --> 01:29:30.830
[SPEAKER_06]: This is stupid that it's like three years out and they're still having these bad shortages.

01:29:31.191 --> 01:29:31.671
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

01:29:31.711 --> 01:29:32.552
[SPEAKER_06]: Then don't buy a Wii.

01:29:33.733 --> 01:29:35.634
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can't find a Wii, maybe you shouldn't buy one.

01:29:35.694 --> 01:29:37.475
[SPEAKER_06]: Go out and get a 360 or a PS3.

01:29:37.495 --> 01:29:39.357
[SPEAKER_06]: They're both much more reasonable than they were before.

01:29:40.802 --> 01:29:41.783
[SPEAKER_06]: James Burt

01:30:04.139 --> 01:30:05.401
[SPEAKER_06]: and he was 24 years old.

01:30:05.481 --> 01:30:12.329
[SPEAKER_06]: He illegally uploaded New Super Mario Brothers Wii to the internet and thanks to a current affair in Australia, I guess, profiled him.

01:30:12.689 --> 01:30:18.115
[SPEAKER_06]: He did this whole little interview there and they asked him, did you admit that what you did was quite stupid?

01:30:19.316 --> 01:30:23.099
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, Nintendo Australia is claiming that the upload of New Super Mario Bros.

01:30:23.139 --> 01:30:26.901
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii was snatched 50,000 times.

01:30:27.581 --> 01:30:36.286
[SPEAKER_06]: He got a copy from somebody who broke the street date on the game and basically saying the folks at Nintendo, it's no different than stealing anything else.

01:30:37.407 --> 01:30:43.211
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, let's see, James Burt will have to pay a $1.5 million fine in Australian dollars.

01:30:43.231 --> 01:30:44.632
[SPEAKER_06]: That's about $1.3 million US.

01:30:44.652 --> 01:30:46.333
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a settlement, by the way, too.

01:30:46.353 --> 01:30:46.453
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

01:30:48.213 --> 01:30:51.054
[SPEAKER_06]: He says it's something he's going to have to work through for the rest of my life.

01:30:51.074 --> 01:30:51.975
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a quote there.

01:30:52.695 --> 01:30:55.236
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's what you get for uploading stuff to the internet.

01:30:55.816 --> 01:30:58.897
[SPEAKER_07]: Downloading, they never seem to go after those people.

01:30:58.937 --> 01:31:01.538
[SPEAKER_07]: But uploaders, man, those are the guys that they go after.

01:31:01.558 --> 01:31:02.078
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

01:31:02.118 --> 01:31:03.418
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't want to be the one that gets caught.

01:31:03.458 --> 01:31:04.399
[SPEAKER_06]: So remember what they say.

01:31:04.479 --> 01:31:05.579
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't copy that floppy.

01:31:06.819 --> 01:31:07.099
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't worry.

01:31:07.139 --> 01:31:08.200
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not copying the floppies.

01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:10.500
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, you know what?

01:31:11.001 --> 01:31:11.481
[SPEAKER_06]: Be careful.

01:31:13.410 --> 01:31:17.733
[SPEAKER_06]: But you do admit, when you copy games like that, you are breaking the law.

01:31:18.113 --> 01:31:21.895
[SPEAKER_06]: You are copying something that's, you know, not supposed to be copied.

01:31:22.736 --> 01:31:24.337
[SPEAKER_06]: There's really no nice way of putting it.

01:31:24.497 --> 01:31:28.259
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're not, I mean... Is it a Robin Hood, steal for the rich, give to the poor thing?

01:31:28.399 --> 01:31:31.001
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, that's an ethical question, but it is stealing.

01:31:31.901 --> 01:31:32.422
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really.

01:31:32.662 --> 01:31:33.964
[SPEAKER_07]: Not by the definition of stealing.

01:31:34.004 --> 01:31:37.969
[SPEAKER_07]: Stealing means that possession is moved from one object to another.

01:31:38.569 --> 01:31:46.659
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, if you have a car stereo in your car and I somehow manage to duplicate that car stereo, you still have your car stereo.

01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:48.802
[SPEAKER_06]: But now I have your car stereo.

01:31:50.518 --> 01:31:51.079
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:32:13.397 --> 01:32:18.799
[SPEAKER_07]: I do feel bad for Nintendo, and this is why they're unable to put out those Nintendo systems.

01:32:18.859 --> 01:32:22.901
[SPEAKER_07]: If only they had sold 50,000 copies more of New Super Mario Bros.

01:32:22.961 --> 01:32:26.022
[SPEAKER_07]: Wii in Australia, the world would be a better place.

01:32:26.943 --> 01:32:27.803
[SPEAKER_07]: Wiis would be plentiful.

01:32:28.003 --> 01:32:28.943
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone would be happy.

01:32:29.083 --> 01:32:33.425
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of times, though, I bet of those 50,000 people, they wouldn't have bought the game.

01:32:33.645 --> 01:32:34.906
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's the one thing I will say.

01:32:35.386 --> 01:32:40.348
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe of the 50,000, like, 500 ever actually planned on buying the game.

01:32:41.609 --> 01:32:44.231
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people want to download stuff because it's free.

01:32:44.931 --> 01:32:53.378
[SPEAKER_06]: There's lots of people that download CDs that are like, oh, I don't know if I'd ever really listen to this, but hey, since I have an opportunity, I'll check this out.

01:32:54.068 --> 01:32:58.589
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually buy CDs and individual tracks off Amazon all the time.

01:32:59.290 --> 01:33:05.311
[SPEAKER_06]: I buy iTunes and regular CDs once in a while too, but what I cannot stand is import.

01:33:05.351 --> 01:33:10.513
[SPEAKER_06]: Very recently, I'll admit, I downloaded a CD, but that's because the CD's not out here, but it's out in another country.

01:33:10.833 --> 01:33:17.155
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll support the artists when they're finally released here, but in the meantime... If it's what I'm thinking of, I'm totally planning on getting that.

01:33:17.255 --> 01:33:18.695
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is what you're thinking.

01:33:19.115 --> 01:33:25.299
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, I actually almost laid down $30 to import an Angela Aki CD, so I was close.

01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:26.500
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let me put it this way.

01:33:27.061 --> 01:33:29.362
[SPEAKER_06]: I think people need to realize it's a worldwide market now.

01:33:30.183 --> 01:33:39.789
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that it is technically theft, but it's one of those, I guess you would say, it's not really a harmless crime, but it's

01:33:42.129 --> 01:33:42.729
[SPEAKER_07]: Victimless?

01:33:43.049 --> 01:33:44.050
[SPEAKER_07]: Victimless, I guess.

01:33:44.210 --> 01:33:44.610
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

01:33:44.690 --> 01:33:47.510
[SPEAKER_07]: But you would see, I guess you could say that development houses are victims.

01:33:47.530 --> 01:33:51.111
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I was going to say, how many development houses did Activision shut down this week?

01:33:51.131 --> 01:33:51.811
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay, come on.

01:33:51.851 --> 01:33:53.512
[SPEAKER_07]: That is not because of piracy.

01:33:53.552 --> 01:33:57.713
[SPEAKER_07]: That is because they're stupid and put out 50,000 different Guitar Hero games.

01:33:58.413 --> 01:33:59.773
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, boo fucking hoo.

01:34:00.253 --> 01:34:02.994
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, you know, those guys got paid for making the games that they did.

01:34:03.174 --> 01:34:03.834
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know what?

01:34:03.854 --> 01:34:09.576
[SPEAKER_07]: The one development house put out the really shitty Transformers games, so I don't feel bad for them at all.

01:34:09.976 --> 01:34:11.376
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Lux of Flux.

01:34:11.676 --> 01:34:11.936
[SPEAKER_07]: Vigilante 8

01:34:36.397 --> 01:34:38.900
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all that it comes down to.

01:34:39.741 --> 01:34:51.715
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'm just being naive, but I don't pirate console games because A, I'd rather have the real thing, and B, it's kind of a pain in the ass to do.

01:34:52.275 --> 01:34:55.759
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually easier for me to use something legitimate like Gamefly.

01:34:56.886 --> 01:34:59.628
[SPEAKER_07]: I could if I wanted to, but I have too many games I'm playing now.

01:34:59.748 --> 01:35:05.393
[SPEAKER_07]: So why would I bother downloading and burning off a game to just sit?

01:35:06.734 --> 01:35:07.195
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, good.

01:35:07.295 --> 01:35:15.261
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, I have a whole stack of games I could be playing, but I don't have time because I'm playing Borderlands or I'm playing Bioshock 2.

01:35:16.402 --> 01:35:19.365
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just I don't have time for that stuff.

01:35:19.802 --> 01:35:23.125
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, the views and opinions expressed by the host do not necessarily... Alright, anyway.

01:35:23.425 --> 01:35:26.607
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you want to express your opinion, we'll take emails.

01:35:26.627 --> 01:35:30.970
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com I'm sure some people are sitting there wanting to say their piece.

01:35:31.250 --> 01:35:34.252
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm sure we'll hear more about this next week.

01:35:35.593 --> 01:35:37.955
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on, I'm going to go ahead and cover this next story as well.

01:35:37.975 --> 01:35:39.957
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to do with the iPad.

01:35:40.937 --> 01:35:41.977
[SPEAKER_06]: and PopCap.

01:35:42.777 --> 01:35:49.779
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently PopCap, or as I've called them before in the show, PopCrack, they do believe that the iPad will change gaming.

01:35:50.359 --> 01:35:53.560
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just going to take about three years and a hardware update before it's really going to happen.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:04.862
[SPEAKER_06]: This comes from the co-founder of PopCap, John Vesci, talking to Eurogamer, saying that the iPad will change gaming, it will be phenomenally successful, and it will fulfill a need consumers don't even know they have yet.

01:36:05.542 --> 01:36:08.465
[SPEAKER_06]: The iPad's important, but I think it's going to be more important in three years.

01:36:08.845 --> 01:36:11.808
[SPEAKER_06]: Look how long it took the iPod to get the momentum where everyone has one.

01:36:11.868 --> 01:36:15.311
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably going to take the second generation iPad to make it really like, wow.

01:36:15.871 --> 01:36:18.533
[SPEAKER_06]: This is my opinion, and I think it's going to be phenomenally successful.

01:36:18.573 --> 01:36:19.054
[SPEAKER_06]: I really do.

01:36:19.394 --> 01:36:20.035
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very simple.

01:36:20.075 --> 01:36:22.957
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like it has a magical set of features, just a great package.

01:36:23.378 --> 01:36:27.981
[SPEAKER_06]: I know what I'm getting when I have to get my mom a computer now, an iPad, because she can't screw it up.

01:36:28.102 --> 01:36:29.303
[SPEAKER_06]: She can't download a bunch of stuff.

01:36:29.323 --> 01:36:30.784
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the perfect mom computer, right?

01:36:31.084 --> 01:36:32.905
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's the perfect computer for 10 year olds to play with.

01:36:32.925 --> 01:36:36.388
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, those comments from PopCap co-founder John Vesci to Hero Gamer.

01:36:48.897 --> 01:36:50.038
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, what's this attachment?

01:36:50.178 --> 01:36:50.898
[SPEAKER_07]: Virus?

01:36:51.278 --> 01:36:53.119
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds interesting.

01:36:53.259 --> 01:37:00.463
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, my mom, who for the longest time didn't even know what the CD tray did in a computer, is now using email.

01:37:00.503 --> 01:37:02.364
[SPEAKER_06]: And I get emails from her, and it's very strange.

01:37:02.804 --> 01:37:04.505
[SPEAKER_11]: My grandmother's using email.

01:37:04.585 --> 01:37:06.586
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm worried the next time I go, she's going to be like...

01:37:06.766 --> 01:37:07.287
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:37:26.846 --> 01:37:27.086
[SPEAKER_06]: and so on.

01:37:48.435 --> 01:37:53.560
[SPEAKER_07]: The Apple products are not computers for complete idiots that can't understand anything.

01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:57.703
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, at least that's, I hope, not the impression that they're trying to put out there.

01:37:58.484 --> 01:38:00.085
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sorry, you're too dumb for PC.

01:38:00.225 --> 01:38:03.008
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to move to the Apple products.

01:38:03.988 --> 01:38:07.071
[SPEAKER_07]: Apple products, it's special ed for computer users.

01:38:07.111 --> 01:38:11.314
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, look, despite the choice of words he used, I think he makes a point.

01:38:11.374 --> 01:38:13.857
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of the same thing I said about the iPad a couple weeks ago.

01:38:14.597 --> 01:38:42.420
[SPEAKER_06]: there's going to be a new one Apple puts out new ones every year and this first version of the iPad is kind of yoink yoink but let's not forget the iPhone didn't have the apps on it when it first came out and that's what really took the iPhone to the next level the iPad will get its features it's just going to take a year I tell you if an iPad like had a video camera on the front of it so you could do video conferencing from it like over 3G and stuff oh my god it would sell like crazy and that'll be in the revision it will

01:38:43.723 --> 01:38:44.704
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait and see.

01:38:44.984 --> 01:38:48.666
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it'll change gaming because it'll have a camera, it'll have motion, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:38:48.686 --> 01:38:49.406
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, though?

01:38:49.566 --> 01:38:56.510
[SPEAKER_07]: The Nintendo Wii 3 will be super awesome because it's going to have holographic graphics and it's just going to be phenomenal.

01:38:56.771 --> 01:38:58.592
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's just support them with that.

01:38:58.612 --> 01:39:04.155
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, with a PlayStation 4, it's going to vacuum the floor and do the dishes and cook me breakfast.

01:39:06.806 --> 01:39:07.727
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's stupid.

01:39:07.767 --> 01:39:09.148
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a stupid argument.

01:39:09.488 --> 01:39:11.870
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, it'll be good in three years.

01:39:12.170 --> 01:39:14.071
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, good for them.

01:39:14.231 --> 01:39:15.472
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be good after they figure it out.

01:39:15.532 --> 01:39:16.333
[SPEAKER_07]: It sucks.

01:39:17.433 --> 01:39:18.194
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

01:39:18.214 --> 01:39:19.375
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an awesome argument.

01:39:19.735 --> 01:39:26.119
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it sucks now, but eventually when they figure out that it sucks and make a better platform, then it'll be awesome.

01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:27.600
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it won't.

01:39:28.161 --> 01:39:30.422
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll still suck, and then they'll come out with something else.

01:39:30.522 --> 01:39:31.083
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be better.

01:39:31.223 --> 01:39:32.944
[SPEAKER_06]: One step closer to the holodeck.

01:39:33.124 --> 01:39:35.546
[SPEAKER_06]: Gaming always takes us one step closer to the holodeck.

01:39:36.492 --> 01:39:37.613
[SPEAKER_07]: Such a stupid argument.

01:39:37.633 --> 01:39:38.253
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

01:39:38.933 --> 01:39:39.894
[SPEAKER_07]: Stupid PopCap.

01:39:40.934 --> 01:39:43.355
[SPEAKER_07]: You make your addicting little games and be done with it.

01:39:43.556 --> 01:39:45.076
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't need your opinion out there in the marketplace.

01:39:45.096 --> 01:39:47.738
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm telling you, Bejeweled Blitz, seriously, crack.

01:39:48.298 --> 01:39:49.538
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, crack.

01:39:49.619 --> 01:39:54.221
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and I give them props for making addictive casual games that sell like crazy.

01:39:55.419 --> 01:39:59.862
[SPEAKER_07]: At the same time, they have no fucking clue what platform works well out there.

01:40:00.402 --> 01:40:01.242
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, come on, man.

01:40:01.363 --> 01:40:04.744
[SPEAKER_07]: It is just a large iPod Touch.

01:40:05.485 --> 01:40:07.126
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all it is.

01:40:07.886 --> 01:40:09.327
[SPEAKER_06]: Let the man have an opinion.

01:40:09.367 --> 01:40:09.807
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

01:40:09.867 --> 01:40:12.689
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be phenomenal later on when the new version comes out.

01:40:12.709 --> 01:40:18.352
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's awesome, but by that time, they're going to come out with something else, and people are going to totally forget about the iPad.

01:40:18.372 --> 01:40:20.053
[SPEAKER_06]: Where every gamer has a voice, Loki.

01:40:20.353 --> 01:40:20.874
[SPEAKER_06]: Every gamer.

01:40:22.748 --> 01:40:23.208
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

01:40:24.329 --> 01:40:26.529
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Loki, what do you have for us next with news?

01:40:26.889 --> 01:40:29.790
[SPEAKER_07]: God, it's so frustrating.

01:40:31.071 --> 01:40:33.712
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, apparently they're making movies about anything nowadays.

01:40:33.892 --> 01:40:39.154
[SPEAKER_07]: That's especially the case when it comes to licensing movie or games into movies.

01:40:39.174 --> 01:40:45.556
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of which, you know, half these games that get licensed into movies, it's like, where the hell are they?

01:40:45.616 --> 01:40:48.337
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, for example, Clock Tower, where the hell is that?

01:40:49.077 --> 01:40:52.098
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, shit, they're making movies based on Battleship.

01:40:52.486 --> 01:40:55.325
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't there supposed to be a Silent Hill 2 movie at some point too?

01:40:55.808 --> 01:40:59.791
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, I'm sure after they're done churning out remakes.

01:40:59.811 --> 01:41:01.292
[SPEAKER_06]: There's supposed to be a new Clue.

01:41:02.213 --> 01:41:04.935
[SPEAKER_06]: They keep saying it's a remake of the 80s one, but it's not.

01:41:05.175 --> 01:41:07.617
[SPEAKER_06]: That is scripture to me.

01:41:07.657 --> 01:41:10.119
[SPEAKER_06]: You do not remake Clue from the 80s, okay?

01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:14.743
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're going to do Battleship and whatever.

01:41:15.103 --> 01:41:16.444
[SPEAKER_06]: No, and Monopoly.

01:41:16.824 --> 01:41:18.225
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, there's a Monopoly movie.

01:41:18.365 --> 01:41:19.666
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't.

01:41:20.407 --> 01:41:21.868
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to see a Yahtzee movie.

01:41:22.328 --> 01:41:23.189
[SPEAKER_06]: Go fish.

01:41:25.851 --> 01:41:28.734
[SPEAKER_06]: A movie about an old maid.

01:41:28.754 --> 01:41:29.615
[SPEAKER_06]: It's awful.

01:41:29.755 --> 01:41:31.497
[SPEAKER_07]: Her pairs of friends.

01:41:31.798 --> 01:41:40.427
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of awful, one of the games that they decided to or I guess the developer of said game is looking to license it into a movie.

01:41:40.447 --> 01:41:41.468
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of the opposite of where...

01:41:42.749 --> 01:41:50.857
[SPEAKER_07]: Darkest of Days is a game based off of these futuristic soldiers that go back in time to save certain people from different wars.

01:41:51.158 --> 01:41:53.220
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically it's time cop again.

01:41:53.980 --> 01:41:57.884
[SPEAKER_07]: You go back in time and you kill people and whatnot.

01:42:00.071 --> 01:42:09.867
[SPEAKER_07]: So now they're looking at... I guess the writers of The Rock are attached to craft the screenplay.

01:42:09.927 --> 01:42:14.434
[SPEAKER_07]: So hey, that could be kind of cool, because they wrote a pretty good screenplay for The Rock, but...

01:42:16.997 --> 01:42:24.320
[SPEAKER_07]: The good thing about this, though, is the premise is interesting enough where most people won't even realize it's a game tie-in.

01:42:24.500 --> 01:42:29.001
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, it's a good thing that they don't associate it with the game at all.

01:42:31.362 --> 01:42:32.542
[SPEAKER_07]: Can they make a movie out of this?

01:42:33.002 --> 01:42:33.882
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think it would be any good?

01:42:33.922 --> 01:42:35.363
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's vague enough to where it works.

01:42:35.423 --> 01:42:37.183
[SPEAKER_07]: It's people going back in time killing other people.

01:42:37.484 --> 01:42:38.864
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds interesting enough.

01:42:40.686 --> 01:43:08.753
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, too bad the game didn't have more of an impact Moving on to a game that probably will have more impact We talked a lot about this last week, Sonic the Hedgehog 4 But the news had just recently came out when we did the show So a little more has developed, including a rumor going around That Sonic the Hedgehog 4 may actually be out in retail Once all of the episodes come out on the various networks Sort of like what they did with Grand Theft Auto 4 They had the download content and then they released it to retail

01:43:09.913 --> 01:43:10.994
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:43:35.131 --> 01:43:36.392
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what do you think of the petition?

01:44:02.955 --> 01:44:03.696
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:44:20.803 --> 01:44:25.506
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkTetsuya says, Nah, they'll just charge for DLC to reskin them.

01:44:25.527 --> 01:44:28.028
[SPEAKER_02]: Sad, but probably true.

01:44:47.622 --> 01:44:48.002
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

01:44:48.303 --> 01:44:51.264
[SPEAKER_06]: Blades of Steel says, yeah, internet petitions don't work.

01:44:51.805 --> 01:44:59.489
[SPEAKER_06]: And Rei Ayanami, I love this comment, says, Sonic, I'm really happy for you and I'm going to let you finish, but Twilight has one of the dumbest fan bases of all time.

01:45:02.270 --> 01:45:03.211
[SPEAKER_06]: Take from that what you will.

01:45:05.312 --> 01:45:05.492
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:45:05.872 --> 01:45:07.033
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, let's go to the mailbag.

01:45:12.481 --> 01:45:18.704
[SPEAKER_06]: Every week we invite you guys to send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we read a few of your favorites here on the show.

01:45:19.144 --> 01:45:25.286
[SPEAKER_06]: Since DarkSakura is having voice issues tonight, I'm going to go ahead and relieve her of her mailbag duties and I'll read the mailbag for her.

01:45:25.907 --> 01:45:30.088
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, send us your emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com We just have a couple emails this week.

01:45:30.789 --> 01:45:35.590
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a whole lot to read tonight, but I do want to read these couple quick emails that we have in the mailbag.

01:45:36.631 --> 01:45:39.072
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to start it off with an email from...

01:45:41.386 --> 01:45:45.987
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see a signature, so I'll just say Sam S from the email header.

01:45:46.647 --> 01:45:47.047
[SPEAKER_06]: Sam says,

01:46:06.152 --> 01:46:34.763
[SPEAKER_06]: so far for 2010 even though we missed like two weeks of show just because there wasn't an actual show I'm pretty good about getting them up in 24 hours so I'd like to pat myself on the back here's a much longer email tonight from the name Molten Brown one of my favorite nicknames that we have out there hey guys it's Molten Brown again yes despite the humor over the name last time I wrote in I decided to keep it well good for you you stick by what you believe in Molten Brown

01:46:35.543 --> 01:46:40.564
[SPEAKER_06]: I listened to your podcast from last week when you touched on the issue of developers' rights again and I wanted to weigh in.

01:46:41.005 --> 01:46:49.107
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my first year of law school and other than making me more cynical about the legal system as a whole, I am realizing how many different things affect the outcome of a lawsuit.

01:46:49.487 --> 01:46:54.348
[SPEAKER_06]: Disclaimer, I could be completely wrong and I accept that, but this is my opinion based on what I know.

01:46:55.068 --> 01:46:55.529
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine by me.

01:46:55.549 --> 01:46:56.669
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm welcoming of all opinions.

01:46:57.426 --> 01:47:03.229
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, I don't think the developers would have a chance against the companies unless they banded together, and even then it would be questionable.

01:47:03.689 --> 01:47:10.352
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the DarkSakura feels that if you don't do anything about a bad situation, you are helping to create the situation, and I agree with her in part.

01:47:10.872 --> 01:47:15.514
[SPEAKER_06]: But I also realize that the game companies are going to have a lot more money to defend themselves than the developers.

01:47:15.954 --> 01:47:24.458
[SPEAKER_06]: And this affects how good of lawyers they can get, what the lawyers can do on their case, whether the lawyer can devote more time to the case or has to juggle multiple clients at the same time.

01:47:24.898 --> 01:47:25.519
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching.

01:47:40.174 --> 01:47:42.596
[SPEAKER_06]: Going Through Discovery, and all the other steps of process.

01:47:43.057 --> 01:47:49.122
[SPEAKER_06]: Developers may not have the monetary means to defend themselves with the law, so even if they wanted to, it might not be possible.

01:47:49.542 --> 01:47:50.343
[SPEAKER_06]: And that sucks.

01:47:50.924 --> 01:47:57.249
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry for being a downer, but I wanted to shed some light on some of the other issues developers may face that prevent them from doing anything.

01:47:57.629 --> 01:47:59.511
[SPEAKER_06]: And Molten Brown signs his email.

01:47:59.911 --> 01:48:02.073
[SPEAKER_06]: This email has been brought to you by Sleep Deprivation.

01:48:02.394 --> 01:48:03.835
[SPEAKER_06]: Need a ready excuse for screwing up?

01:48:03.915 --> 01:48:05.897
[SPEAKER_06]: Sleep Deprivation may be the thing for you.

01:48:07.037 --> 01:48:09.959
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, any comments on the other perspective there?

01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:11.580
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I agree with it.

01:48:12.121 --> 01:48:25.129
[SPEAKER_02]: I just still think that if it's still, I think that people need to put the effort into, this is why I'm thinking it would be something like along the lines of a class action lawsuit.

01:48:26.649 --> 01:48:35.737
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I kind of suggested this a couple weeks ago, and I realize this is a polarizing topic, and I don't want to get too political, but I just want to throw that idea out there and see what sticks.

01:48:36.458 --> 01:48:36.818
[SPEAKER_06]: Unions.

01:48:37.399 --> 01:48:43.564
[SPEAKER_06]: What if there was, like, a union for game developers that they kind of banded together and then maybe could afford some of these things?

01:48:43.604 --> 01:48:44.065
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

01:48:44.425 --> 01:48:48.809
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, granted, then you get all these, like, the dues that goes with it, but at least there would be, like, a union to fight for rights.

01:48:49.429 --> 01:48:52.772
[SPEAKER_06]: But look, I realize it's a polarizing topic, but I just want to throw the idea out there.

01:48:52.832 --> 01:48:53.073
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean...

01:48:53.653 --> 01:48:55.414
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you tell me what's right or what's wrong with that idea?

01:48:55.434 --> 01:48:56.294
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a good idea.

01:48:56.314 --> 01:49:02.536
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the whole point that it's sad that we're dealing with, you know, that level of corruption, I think, in the system.

01:49:03.536 --> 01:49:05.577
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to continue this debate next week, that's fine.

01:49:05.637 --> 01:49:10.899
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're going to email us on this topic again at mailbag at orangelounge.com, I really want to hear your thoughts on the whole union idea.

01:49:10.939 --> 01:49:13.300
[SPEAKER_06]: Good idea, bad idea, whatever idea.

01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:15.281
[SPEAKER_06]: That was really it for emails this week.

01:49:15.341 --> 01:49:19.382
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at orangelounge.com if you want to send us more emails.

01:49:20.698 --> 01:49:21.739
[SPEAKER_12]: What was that, DarkSakura?

01:49:21.859 --> 01:49:23.760
[SPEAKER_12]: We're having a child meltdown in the other room.

01:49:23.780 --> 01:49:24.341
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I can hear.

01:49:24.361 --> 01:49:27.123
[SPEAKER_06]: It's alright, we're going to still try to continue with the show.

01:49:28.184 --> 01:49:30.867
[SPEAKER_06]: After the mailbag, we always like to take a minute to say F.U.

01:49:31.307 --> 01:49:32.648
[SPEAKER_06]: to things that are making us angry.

01:49:32.708 --> 01:49:34.550
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little segment we call the F.U.s of the week.

01:49:50.714 --> 01:49:52.317
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, do you have any angst for us tonight?

01:49:52.517 --> 01:49:53.098
[SPEAKER_02]: Being sick.

01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:54.400
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

01:49:56.884 --> 01:49:57.805
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really, actually.

01:49:58.306 --> 01:49:59.127
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have anything.

01:50:01.591 --> 01:50:01.792
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

01:50:01.832 --> 01:50:02.693
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just in a good mood?

01:50:02.733 --> 01:50:03.314
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything's happy?

01:50:03.835 --> 01:50:04.937
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm in a complacent mood.

01:50:05.558 --> 01:50:06.139
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, good to hear it.

01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:09.082
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really have a lot of FUs either.

01:50:09.102 --> 01:50:10.603
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like I should have something.

01:50:11.104 --> 01:50:15.148
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just give another FU to moving and having to get everything in boxes and all that good stuff.

01:50:15.488 --> 01:50:18.551
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not looking forward to moving, but at least it'll be over after this week.

01:50:18.932 --> 01:50:20.013
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and an FU to my car.

01:50:21.515 --> 01:50:24.918
[SPEAKER_06]: There's always a new surprise when it breaks down in my car, and today it's the air conditioner.

01:50:26.119 --> 01:50:26.439
[SPEAKER_06]: Goodie, goodie.

01:50:40.104 --> 01:50:40.504
[SPEAKER_05]: Fun time.

01:50:40.584 --> 01:50:41.805
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to do it for the FUs of the week.

01:50:43.065 --> 01:50:43.345
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:50:44.045 --> 01:50:46.106
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on with some more news stories.

01:50:46.126 --> 01:50:47.166
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a couple more for you guys.

01:50:47.186 --> 01:50:52.228
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:50:52.668 --> 01:50:58.970
[SPEAKER_06]: Do remember, if you're going to use the Skype client to actually call us, call Echo123 first if you've never been on the show before.

01:50:59.450 --> 01:51:02.351
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if you have been on the show before, you might just want to double check that you're okay.

01:51:02.831 --> 01:51:02.991
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki?

01:51:03.673 --> 01:51:15.736
[SPEAKER_07]: During the 2009 fiscal earnings report from Activision, CEO Michael Griffith noted that Bizarre Creations would be doing a multiplayer beta for Blur next month.

01:51:16.136 --> 01:51:23.197
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't specify when exactly it's going to be, but at least it'll be on...

01:51:29.136 --> 01:51:29.616
[SPEAKER_07]: The Xbox 360.

01:51:30.036 --> 01:51:31.537
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's stupid.

01:51:31.557 --> 01:51:34.439
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't say what platforms the games are coming out on.

01:51:35.399 --> 01:51:36.900
[SPEAKER_07]: PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:40.982
[SPEAKER_07]: But no word on which platform they're actually going to do the beta for.

01:51:42.443 --> 01:51:43.503
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm excited for Blur.

01:51:43.523 --> 01:51:46.165
[SPEAKER_06]: It was one of my favorite things we saw at E3 last year.

01:51:46.205 --> 01:51:47.745
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Mario Kart meets Burnout.

01:51:47.925 --> 01:51:49.126
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's why I was calling it before.

01:51:49.326 --> 01:51:49.766
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be neat.

01:51:50.006 --> 01:51:50.227
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

01:51:50.247 --> 01:51:50.987
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm excited for it.

01:51:52.231 --> 01:51:55.414
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, and the last story I have for you guys tonight has to do with Game Room.

01:51:55.454 --> 01:51:57.436
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, I'm pretty excited about Game Room.

01:51:57.476 --> 01:51:58.396
[SPEAKER_06]: I love my classic games.

01:51:58.837 --> 01:52:02.260
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are some more tidbits coming out of the X10 event when it comes to Game Room.

01:52:03.100 --> 01:52:06.944
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, five to seven games a week are supposed to be added for download.

01:52:06.984 --> 01:52:07.924
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what they're claiming.

01:52:07.964 --> 01:52:09.626
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see if it becomes a reality or not.

01:52:10.226 --> 01:52:15.431
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to do like a weekly release on a particular day, kind of like what they do for Rock Band or the Xbox Live Arcade.

01:52:16.091 --> 01:52:19.154
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, they're looking at Thursday, but that could change.

01:52:20.194 --> 01:52:24.876
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, apparently they're going to add some incentives for you to get games the day that they come out.

01:52:25.356 --> 01:52:30.859
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you buy a game the day it comes out, it will be a special item that stays with you in your personal game room.

01:52:31.819 --> 01:52:38.062
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things that the game room producer Fred Norton was showing off was a helicopter that flew around the player's avatar.

01:52:38.702 --> 01:52:40.963
[SPEAKER_06]: The day one exclusives would be different for every game.

01:52:41.263 --> 01:52:44.785
[SPEAKER_06]: It would somehow tie into the game's iconography.

01:52:44.865 --> 01:52:45.505
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, you know,

01:52:46.185 --> 01:52:56.692
[SPEAKER_06]: and if you really watch that Game Room trailer you can see like a little yellow dragon from Adventure rendered in 3D which I know sounds weird but it's like walking around the little playhouse.

01:52:57.013 --> 01:53:00.095
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet it would be little things like that that you're going to get for day one releases.

01:53:00.715 --> 01:53:01.275
[SPEAKER_06]: I would imagine.

01:53:02.536 --> 01:53:06.277
[SPEAKER_07]: So have they mentioned how you're going to be able to go to like friends game rooms and stuff like that?

01:53:06.297 --> 01:53:09.478
[SPEAKER_07]: Because what's the point in decorating your own game room if only you see it?

01:53:09.678 --> 01:53:10.538
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they haven't.

01:53:10.578 --> 01:53:14.259
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm thinking I wouldn't get too excited about this.

01:53:14.319 --> 01:53:18.400
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's just going to be that you have your game room and you can go look at others' games room.

01:53:18.480 --> 01:53:20.541
[SPEAKER_06]: I would think that you would at least be able to play a demo.

01:53:20.821 --> 01:53:21.521
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know what it is?

01:53:21.621 --> 01:53:23.862
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be the way for them to solicit the quarters.

01:53:24.422 --> 01:53:28.443
[SPEAKER_06]: You probably will do a lot of your 40 Microsoft Point play or your 50 cent play.

01:53:28.863 --> 01:53:38.429
[SPEAKER_06]: visiting other people's game rooms I think that's the whole idea behind it is go visit your friends game rooms and try out their machines for 40 points at pop I bet you that's what it is

01:53:40.020 --> 01:53:41.021
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see though.

01:53:41.241 --> 01:53:48.125
[SPEAKER_06]: There's still a ways to go before the end of March when Game Room is expected to come out and hopefully our questions will be answered by then.

01:53:48.906 --> 01:53:52.688
[SPEAKER_06]: So that does it for the scheduled stories we have tonight.

01:53:53.008 --> 01:53:54.869
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to go ahead and go to the Skype line.

01:53:54.929 --> 01:54:04.275
[SPEAKER_06]: First though, before we get to the Skype line tonight, I want to play this voicemail because this is about something we probably haven't talked enough about on the show, but it is a big thing going on on our website right now.

01:54:04.315 --> 01:54:05.716
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me play this voicemail first.

01:54:08.385 --> 01:54:11.646
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi Rob, this is Brett Wall from Undersedation Live.

01:54:12.126 --> 01:54:20.709
[SPEAKER_09]: Our show's on hiatus, so I'm leaving a voicemail to Orange Lounge Radio reminding all of your listeners to participate in QSL Madness.

01:54:21.029 --> 01:54:21.909
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm getting distracted.

01:54:22.289 --> 01:54:25.010
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're in the round of 64 right now.

01:54:25.030 --> 01:54:27.071
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some fantastic matchups going on.

01:54:27.231 --> 01:54:30.532
[SPEAKER_09]: All you need is a form account and a hand to click your mouse with.

01:54:31.572 --> 01:54:32.733
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all in our form.

01:54:33.153 --> 01:54:35.734
[SPEAKER_09]: They're at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

01:54:35.754 --> 01:54:36.714
[SPEAKER_09]: Be sure to visit and

01:54:37.259 --> 01:54:39.761
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello to everybody out there in Orange Bond Radio Land.

01:54:39.921 --> 01:54:41.263
[SPEAKER_09]: We missed you on USL.

01:54:41.343 --> 01:54:42.864
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, talk to you later.

01:54:43.044 --> 01:54:43.745
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

01:54:44.666 --> 01:54:46.908
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much, Bressel, from Under Station Live.

01:54:46.968 --> 01:54:47.969
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know they were on hiatus.

01:54:47.989 --> 01:54:48.629
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on there?

01:54:48.970 --> 01:54:51.111
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought I saw a tweet about it, but I don't know.

01:54:51.151 --> 01:54:54.034
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes Travis threatens to go on hiatus, but then doesn't really go on hiatus.

01:54:54.054 --> 01:54:55.916
[SPEAKER_06]: So I hope everything's okay over at USL Land.

01:54:56.316 --> 01:54:56.997
[SPEAKER_06]: So whatever.

01:54:57.677 --> 01:54:59.359
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you guys get better or whatever's going on.

01:54:59.999 --> 01:55:08.165
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, Under Station Live Madness, the big battle to figure out the greatest video game of all time is going on right now on the Orange Lounge Radio forums.

01:55:08.625 --> 01:55:10.747
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of some surprising things going on there.

01:55:10.827 --> 01:55:16.031
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I kind of lost my shit and got angry when Time Crisis beat Civilization, which I think is a travesty.

01:55:16.731 --> 01:55:18.793
[SPEAKER_06]: But whatever, I'll leave my opinions on the forums.

01:55:20.094 --> 01:55:45.693
[SPEAKER_06]: You can vote for whichever game you like more And then they kind of whittle their way down It's kind of modeled after a March Madness NCAA kind of thing To the greatest video game of all time Which Super Metroid won one year I think Mario 3 won it last year And so we'll see who wins this year There's a bunch of stuff going on on the forums right now So if you haven't checked that out, check that out on the forums At OrangeLoungeRadio.com There's a whole little March Madness section there So take a look

01:55:46.624 --> 01:55:51.646
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we're going to go to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:55:51.666 --> 01:55:53.287
[SPEAKER_06]: We're now open for business on the Skype line.

01:55:53.347 --> 01:55:55.948
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead and give us a call if you'd like, and we'll take some calls.

01:55:56.928 --> 01:55:57.909
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:55:57.929 --> 01:55:58.269
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

01:55:59.309 --> 01:56:00.690
[SPEAKER_06]: This is DSMaster26.

01:56:00.810 --> 01:56:02.811
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, DSMaster, what's on your mind?

01:56:04.971 --> 01:56:06.552
[SPEAKER_08]: Not much.

01:56:06.892 --> 01:56:13.575
[SPEAKER_08]: I participated in the finale of 1 vs. 100, which was perceived to be a Halo game.

01:56:16.683 --> 01:56:17.023
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

01:56:17.483 --> 01:56:18.324
[SPEAKER_06]: Did that happen tonight?

01:56:18.404 --> 01:56:19.944
[SPEAKER_06]: Was the 1 vs. 100 finale tonight?

01:56:21.165 --> 01:56:23.626
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it was two days ago.

01:56:24.486 --> 01:56:25.147
[SPEAKER_06]: So what did they do?

01:56:25.207 --> 01:56:26.847
[SPEAKER_06]: What made it such a Halo fangasm?

01:56:26.907 --> 01:56:27.348
[SPEAKER_06]: I missed it.

01:56:27.388 --> 01:56:29.068
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot that the season was coming to an end.

01:56:30.049 --> 01:56:35.151
[SPEAKER_08]: They had two of the creators from Halo 3 and 3 of it.

01:56:35.531 --> 01:56:38.332
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, the creators of the whole series on there.

01:56:39.273 --> 01:56:44.115
[SPEAKER_08]: Talking about the Halo series and Halo Legends being on

01:56:53.679 --> 01:56:57.141
[SPEAKER_06]: Was there any mention of the whole news about Xbox Live?

01:56:57.161 --> 01:57:03.966
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I know this just happened a couple weeks ago about original Xbox Live shutting down for original Xbox and how that will impact Halo 2.

01:57:04.186 --> 01:57:04.966
[SPEAKER_06]: Did that come up at all?

01:57:07.128 --> 01:57:08.649
[SPEAKER_08]: I did not talk about that.

01:57:09.629 --> 01:57:11.611
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that doesn't really surprise me.

01:57:11.651 --> 01:57:13.292
[SPEAKER_06]: I just kind of wondered if that would come up at all.

01:57:13.633 --> 01:57:16.875
[SPEAKER_06]: Did they say anything during the finale about the next season of 1 vs. 100?

01:57:19.297 --> 01:57:26.043
[SPEAKER_08]: They said there is definitely going to be Season 3, but they don't know exactly when it's possibly going to start.

01:57:26.063 --> 01:57:30.326
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn, it's cold in Nebraska.

01:57:31.127 --> 01:57:31.287
Yeah.

01:57:34.148 --> 01:57:35.549
[SPEAKER_08]: And the sky is blue.

01:57:35.569 --> 01:57:36.009
[SPEAKER_06]: What else is new?

01:57:36.029 --> 01:57:38.011
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a little bit of a news announcement for you guys.

01:57:38.031 --> 01:57:46.918
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the broadcasting class from the Career Center over here in Omaha, Nebraska is coming all the way to Anaheim, California.

01:57:48.279 --> 01:57:48.599
All right.

01:57:48.940 --> 01:57:49.420
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, wait.

01:57:49.460 --> 01:57:51.361
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to take it back to 1 vs. 100 for a minute here.

01:57:51.702 --> 01:57:53.003
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you want to see in Season 3?

01:57:54.964 --> 01:57:55.224
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh?

01:57:56.345 --> 01:57:57.907
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you want to see in Season 3 of 1 vs. 100?

01:57:57.947 --> 01:57:58.007
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh.

01:58:02.970 --> 01:58:08.117
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, probably them to try to get... Oh, God.

01:58:08.217 --> 01:58:11.682
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably the guys behind DJ Hero or something like that.

01:58:12.483 --> 01:58:12.704
[SPEAKER_08]: Like...

01:58:13.382 --> 01:58:17.726
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and actually, that same night with the Halo guys, Jimmy Fallon popped in once or twice.

01:58:38.717 --> 01:58:39.918
[SPEAKER_08]: He was definitely funny.

01:58:39.938 --> 01:58:40.919
[SPEAKER_08]: He also plays 1 vs. 100.

01:58:40.979 --> 01:58:41.119
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh.

01:58:41.139 --> 01:58:41.300
[SPEAKER_08]: Well...

01:59:02.574 --> 01:59:12.119
[SPEAKER_08]: There are three game shows in my mind that would be really good for Xbox 5 and that same spiel that 1 vs. 100 is going at.

01:59:13.059 --> 01:59:14.620
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, but not really.

01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:16.701
[SPEAKER_08]: Deal or no deal, no.

01:59:16.941 --> 01:59:17.662
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a no-go.

01:59:18.882 --> 01:59:21.263
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably Who Wants to be a Millionaire, that'd be good.

01:59:21.283 --> 01:59:23.885
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a video game years ago.

01:59:24.025 --> 01:59:24.425
[SPEAKER_06]: Good idea.

01:59:26.885 --> 01:59:34.547
[SPEAKER_06]: I do also give a big fat no to Deal or No Deal because I hate that game show.

01:59:34.667 --> 01:59:35.927
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a terrible game show.

01:59:36.187 --> 01:59:42.149
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the worst game show, one of the worst they've ever done because Deal or No Deal takes absolutely no skill.

01:59:42.269 --> 01:59:43.929
[SPEAKER_06]: There is zero skill involved.

01:59:44.129 --> 01:59:48.190
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of Deal or No Deal, you know those ticket redemption games, right?

01:59:48.530 --> 01:59:49.450
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I've played it.

01:59:49.470 --> 01:59:51.171
[SPEAKER_08]: They need a deal or no deal for that now.

01:59:51.611 --> 01:59:52.472
[SPEAKER_06]: I've played it.

01:59:52.612 --> 01:59:53.732
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate to admit, I've played it.

01:59:54.452 --> 02:00:02.115
[SPEAKER_06]: My friend, it wasn't me, but one of my friends actually got all the way down to opening the final case and won the jackpot.

02:00:02.195 --> 02:00:02.735
[SPEAKER_06]: I was amazed.

02:00:04.296 --> 02:00:08.457
[SPEAKER_06]: But then I also wasn't because I was like, she just got lucky because there's no skill involved.

02:00:09.918 --> 02:00:11.399
[SPEAKER_08]: There are two game shows in my mind.

02:00:12.119 --> 02:00:14.720
[SPEAKER_08]: Would possibly have to be like Wheel of Fortune.

02:00:14.740 --> 02:00:15.640
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be pretty good.

02:00:16.841 --> 02:00:17.021
[SPEAKER_08]: And...

02:00:18.547 --> 02:00:19.788
[SPEAKER_08]: Hollywood Squares.

02:00:20.728 --> 02:00:22.269
[SPEAKER_06]: Hollywood Squares I'd be down with.

02:00:22.289 --> 02:00:23.109
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be pretty funny.

02:00:23.129 --> 02:00:24.550
[SPEAKER_06]: You could totally do the prices right.

02:00:24.990 --> 02:00:25.650
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you could.

02:00:25.890 --> 02:00:26.830
[SPEAKER_06]: You could, but they won't.

02:00:27.151 --> 02:00:29.752
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, DS Master.

02:00:30.012 --> 02:00:40.496
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to let you know, I don't know what ear to my phone or something, but the audio when you're speaking on my end, like you're sounding a little bit crackly.

02:00:40.516 --> 02:00:42.557
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what's up.

02:00:43.077 --> 02:00:44.678
[SPEAKER_06]: It's demons in the phone system.

02:00:47.489 --> 02:00:47.850
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn.

02:00:48.251 --> 02:00:49.553
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, have a good night, DS Master.

02:00:50.495 --> 02:00:53.581
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, you too, and happy Valentine's Day, all our crew.

02:00:53.962 --> 02:00:54.223
[SPEAKER_06]: Later.

02:00:55.729 --> 02:01:17.701
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what that is it's always going to sound a little weird over our little rigged setup here but do remember if you do call OLR turn your volume down a lot so that you don't get picked up in fact it's even best to turn it off or mute it or something just keep that in mind 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype Orange Lounge Radio on Skype Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?

02:01:19.182 --> 02:01:22.104
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi this is Spazinator Hi Spazinator what's on your mind?

02:01:24.608 --> 02:01:29.772
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, well, one issue is kind of a compound issue.

02:01:30.832 --> 02:01:38.137
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you saw my one tweet from earlier, but I kind of want to take Sony to ask about a problem that I'm having.

02:01:38.637 --> 02:01:39.417
[SPEAKER_05]: Please do.

02:01:40.618 --> 02:01:51.965
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, my initial problem is my PlayStation 3 just last weekend got the dreaded yellow light of death.

02:01:52.981 --> 02:01:53.682
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-oh.

02:01:55.363 --> 02:02:08.272
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm sure you, DarkSakura, and Loki all know what that is.

02:02:08.393 --> 02:02:11.455
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't bother explaining it.

02:02:11.735 --> 02:02:17.279
[SPEAKER_06]: So are you just mad about the yellow light, or did something happen in trying to get it fixed?

02:02:19.901 --> 02:02:21.622
[SPEAKER_10]: Using so much the

02:02:23.191 --> 02:02:24.491
[SPEAKER_10]: the Joe White Adults.

02:02:25.311 --> 02:02:32.773
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that systems fail and I can always, you know, and I plan on taking it to Sony to every fix.

02:02:33.253 --> 02:02:34.753
[SPEAKER_10]: There isn't so much a problem.

02:02:35.513 --> 02:02:52.917
[SPEAKER_10]: Where the problem lies is that when I explained the situation to one of the Sony reps and told them that I didn't need to send my system in for repairs, I need to explain to them that I have two profiles on my system and one of which is for gaming and one is

02:02:53.464 --> 02:02:55.485
[SPEAKER_10]: for purchasing movies and TV shows.

02:02:56.946 --> 02:03:01.689
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have a lot of video content that I purchased through the store.

02:03:02.949 --> 02:03:16.657
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was concerned about being able to play the videos that I purchased once I get the system back because they get really wonky DRM.

02:03:17.798 --> 02:03:21.240
[SPEAKER_10]: And to paraphrase what the one rep said,

02:03:22.329 --> 02:03:26.982
[SPEAKER_10]: There's like a 50-50 chance that you may lose all your content.

02:03:29.246 --> 02:03:30.847
[SPEAKER_06]: A 50-50 chance?

02:03:31.267 --> 02:03:34.009
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell kind of advice is that?

02:03:34.069 --> 02:03:34.790
[SPEAKER_06]: That's weird.

02:03:35.690 --> 02:03:37.812
[SPEAKER_06]: I interpret that as there's a zero chance.

02:03:37.852 --> 02:03:40.073
[SPEAKER_06]: They're giving you false hope and that's pretty disgusting.

02:03:40.674 --> 02:03:44.476
[SPEAKER_06]: And I remember you went through this whole mess not that long ago.

02:03:45.337 --> 02:03:49.780
[SPEAKER_06]: You lost all your DRM to video content and you finally got it.

02:03:49.800 --> 02:03:52.401
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember you called us and we said, don't take no for an answer.

02:03:52.441 --> 02:03:53.102
[SPEAKER_06]: You keep calling back.

02:03:53.382 --> 02:03:55.664
[SPEAKER_06]: And finally you were able to get some of it back.

02:03:55.744 --> 02:03:57.545
[SPEAKER_06]: But it sounds like they're running you through that gauntlet again.

02:03:59.006 --> 02:04:00.406
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

02:04:01.567 --> 02:04:24.355
[SPEAKER_10]: My line of thought is to follow with what you just said, is that I paid through the nose for all this content, you know, two to three bucks per TV episode, you know, I got a whole shit ton of them, plus $10 to $15 per movie.

02:04:27.206 --> 02:04:32.170
[SPEAKER_10]: And I get like hundreds and hundreds of videos, so needless to say, that's a lot of money.

02:04:33.170 --> 02:04:38.835
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, I expect that since I pay for all this stuff, I should be able to use it.

02:04:39.716 --> 02:04:48.663
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, right now I have a hardware failure, you know, which I have to send my machine into a repair bus.

02:04:49.481 --> 02:04:55.804
[SPEAKER_10]: Once I get the machine repair, I should be able to play the content that I purchased.

02:04:56.484 --> 02:05:14.351
[SPEAKER_06]: Spazator, please keep us posted with what happens after the repair and everything, or which side of the 50-50 or whatever you end up on, because if you do lose your access to all that and they don't do anything about it, I want to help put it out there in the public, because everybody needs to think twice about buying something.

02:05:14.671 --> 02:05:20.915
[SPEAKER_06]: A damn thing from Sony if, you know, this is the way they're going to treat it as like, well, there's a 50-50 chance it might still work.

02:05:21.336 --> 02:05:22.957
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why people hate DRM.

02:05:23.457 --> 02:05:27.400
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they're going to leave the door wide open like this, people need to know to not support it.

02:05:27.800 --> 02:05:37.087
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would really encourage you that if Sony does not do the right thing, does not satisfy you, does not leave you a satisfied customer, stop buying stuff on the marketplace.

02:05:37.167 --> 02:05:38.107
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that's going to be painful.

02:05:38.187 --> 02:05:39.028
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you use them a lot.

02:05:39.268 --> 02:05:40.569
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're going to have to explore alternatives.

02:05:40.589 --> 02:05:41.069
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to.

02:05:41.249 --> 02:05:41.930
[SPEAKER_06]: You owe it to yourself.

02:05:43.564 --> 02:05:58.515
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, what I got planned for your time being, which I already mentioned, on Twitter and Facebook is I never set my system in just yet because I'm waiting on a check from a Social Security Disability P.E.

02:05:58.675 --> 02:06:01.557
[SPEAKER_10]: to cover the cost of the repairs.

02:06:02.238 --> 02:06:03.859
[SPEAKER_10]: But once I do get that check...

02:06:05.837 --> 02:06:06.238
[SPEAKER_10]: Good idea.

02:06:06.258 --> 02:06:13.388
[SPEAKER_10]: Spaznier, we're going to have to wrap up so we can get to some more calls, but please keep us posted on what happens.

02:06:23.365 --> 02:06:23.745
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure.

02:06:23.865 --> 02:06:24.226
[SPEAKER_10]: Will do.

02:06:24.426 --> 02:06:24.686
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

02:06:25.526 --> 02:06:26.187
[SPEAKER_06]: You too, Spadina.

02:06:26.227 --> 02:06:26.807
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, buddy.

02:06:27.047 --> 02:06:27.287
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck.

02:06:27.307 --> 02:06:27.927
[SPEAKER_06]: Let us know what happens.

02:06:29.208 --> 02:06:30.949
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, that is irritating.

02:06:31.109 --> 02:06:32.870
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be so mad if I was him right now.

02:06:33.711 --> 02:06:35.371
[SPEAKER_06]: And I love what Brad is saying here in chat.

02:06:35.391 --> 02:06:37.753
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, we don't know what the end result's gonna be, so we'll see.

02:06:38.053 --> 02:06:42.755
[SPEAKER_06]: But Brad says in chat, shit like this is why I just torrent my video content.

02:06:42.835 --> 02:06:45.897
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, Loki was just having this whole spiel on piracy earlier.

02:06:45.957 --> 02:06:47.038
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, this is it right here.

02:06:47.398 --> 02:06:49.039
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, people pirate because of DRM.

02:06:49.179 --> 02:06:50.960
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you want to know legitimately...

02:06:51.560 --> 02:06:57.864
[SPEAKER_06]: Why there might be a fraction of a reason to support piracy, listen to Spassinator's call.

02:06:57.985 --> 02:07:07.611
[SPEAKER_06]: If his thing comes back and none of his content works again, I'm going to be like, dude, you should be pirating things on the PlayStation marketplace because that's the only way you're going to get around the DRM.

02:07:07.631 --> 02:07:09.753
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see why it wouldn't work because...

02:07:10.854 --> 02:07:13.175
[SPEAKER_07]: It's tied to his account, not his system.

02:07:13.496 --> 02:07:14.456
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he had the problem before.

02:07:14.737 --> 02:07:18.199
[SPEAKER_06]: But, dude, can you believe a rep told him there's a 50-50 chance you're going to lose it all?

02:07:18.219 --> 02:07:20.421
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's stupid people working for all companies.

02:07:20.661 --> 02:07:22.383
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like saying, I might like you and I might not.

02:07:22.703 --> 02:07:23.003
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

02:07:23.063 --> 02:07:26.006
[SPEAKER_06]: As a customer service trainer, that irritates me.

02:07:26.606 --> 02:07:27.967
[SPEAKER_06]: Call back and talk to a different rep.

02:07:29.048 --> 02:07:29.889
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get to another call.

02:07:29.929 --> 02:07:30.970
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:07:30.990 --> 02:07:31.330
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

02:07:32.151 --> 02:07:32.571
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.

02:07:32.651 --> 02:07:34.292
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from the west coast of Sweden.

02:07:34.332 --> 02:07:35.213
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Judith speaking.

02:07:35.393 --> 02:07:36.034
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, hello.

02:07:36.394 --> 02:07:37.795
[SPEAKER_06]: Another Swedish listener?

02:07:37.835 --> 02:07:38.636
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know Ake Ripper?

02:07:39.471 --> 02:07:43.712
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't know him, but I heard him on the last episode, I think he called in.

02:07:44.272 --> 02:07:45.873
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've heard him a bunch of times.

02:07:46.173 --> 02:07:49.213
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured I'd try and get on and represent Sweden.

02:07:50.194 --> 02:07:52.554
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, we're all about... Dude, we're like getting bigger than ABBA.

02:07:52.834 --> 02:07:53.514
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, no, alright.

02:07:55.215 --> 02:07:56.755
[SPEAKER_06]: So to what do we owe this phone call tonight?

02:07:56.775 --> 02:07:57.275
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind?

02:07:57.975 --> 02:07:58.736
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a couple of things.

02:07:58.876 --> 02:07:59.616
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I would like to...

02:08:00.596 --> 02:08:06.623
[SPEAKER_00]: Do like a shout out to the person who directed me to Orange Lounge Radio and got me to start listening to it.

02:08:07.183 --> 02:08:08.264
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's Dalit.

02:08:08.525 --> 02:08:11.207
[SPEAKER_00]: It's D-A-L-33-T.

02:08:12.709 --> 02:08:18.435
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think he's ever called in or been on the chat, but I just want to give him a big thank you and hopefully he hears this and gets back to me.

02:08:18.715 --> 02:08:26.920
[SPEAKER_06]: Dalit, thank you for being Leet because we always do say at the end of the show if you like Orange Lounge Radio tell a friend or two about the show and help us spread the word.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:30.562
[SPEAKER_06]: Clearly Leet has done that and gets a gold star for his efforts.

02:08:30.602 --> 02:08:30.922
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

02:08:31.663 --> 02:08:33.224
[SPEAKER_02]: And happy first call to the show.

02:08:33.604 --> 02:08:34.985
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and happy first call to the show.

02:08:35.615 --> 02:08:36.815
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I'll have many more.

02:08:37.776 --> 02:08:38.696
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also have a question.

02:08:39.416 --> 02:08:47.058
[SPEAKER_00]: You had talked a bit about piracy before, and it's such a big concern, and there's been a lot of talking about it in the chat.

02:08:47.998 --> 02:08:49.078
[SPEAKER_00]: What should they do to prevent it?

02:08:49.119 --> 02:08:59.101
[SPEAKER_00]: Should they have more DRM, less DRM, more extreme DRM, like maybe having to take a photo of your receipt and then send it in and have to call in and then have it activated online?

02:08:59.201 --> 02:09:02.122
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what should companies do to prevent piracy?

02:09:03.623 --> 02:09:04.764
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think there's an easy answer.

02:09:04.804 --> 02:09:08.165
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if that answer were out there, it would probably be being done right now.

02:09:08.225 --> 02:09:09.226
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.

02:09:09.446 --> 02:09:12.707
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not easy to solve, but how should they go about trying to solve it?

02:09:12.807 --> 02:09:13.348
[SPEAKER_00]: What approach?

02:09:14.248 --> 02:09:16.229
[SPEAKER_00]: More restrictions or more freedom?

02:09:17.893 --> 02:09:21.316
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a fan of the program-based DRM.

02:09:21.536 --> 02:09:25.980
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer activation codes, though they are easier to bypass.

02:09:27.100 --> 02:09:38.750
[SPEAKER_02]: But for an example of it being effective, when I was given Guild Wars as a present and my activation code had been scratched off, I couldn't find a generator, I couldn't do anything.

02:09:39.290 --> 02:09:45.237
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually took a photo of my code and gave them the serial number off of my box.

02:09:45.357 --> 02:09:56.410
[SPEAKER_02]: They sent me a new code and that to me I think is less frustrating than having to deal with something that's going to install on your system or having to re-download things.

02:09:56.990 --> 02:09:57.470
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're

02:10:23.695 --> 02:10:25.497
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where things are going to go.

02:10:25.717 --> 02:10:27.138
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I think they should go there?

02:10:28.079 --> 02:10:30.341
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe not, but that's where they're going to go.

02:10:32.302 --> 02:10:37.627
[SPEAKER_06]: I always miss the old, you have to look in the manual to look at the faces or match things up.

02:10:38.368 --> 02:10:41.150
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how they used to do the old PC stuff back in the day.

02:10:41.190 --> 02:10:43.432
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but that stuff, you can photocopy that.

02:10:43.552 --> 02:10:44.613
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, but I miss that stuff.

02:10:44.833 --> 02:10:57.943
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, here's my real answer, though, is that I think one way that they could do it is, it's kind of one thing they're doing, is it's kind of one of those fight fire with fire, is that the publishers themselves go out on these torrent sites and put the games up for download, but they're borked versions.

02:10:58.303 --> 02:11:01.506
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the whole, you remember, Arkham Asylum was crippled.

02:11:01.526 --> 02:11:02.887
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mirror's Edge and stuff like that, yeah.

02:11:02.927 --> 02:11:03.147
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I...

02:11:03.447 --> 02:11:03.987
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com

02:11:30.527 --> 02:11:42.735
[SPEAKER_07]: So that may work in the short run, but people will find, or, you know, as in the case of Batman Arkham Asylum, people will find a way around it within like a day, and that will be done for.

02:11:43.276 --> 02:11:59.606
[SPEAKER_07]: So really the easiest way to do it, and unfortunately it is going to be the mandatory online activations, and it's basically going to be a code inside like a manual or something like that that they're going to have to enter into some online service to download a key or something.

02:12:00.987 --> 02:12:06.550
[SPEAKER_07]: or it's going to be inside the manual and you put it in the game and then people will find a key generator around it.

02:12:06.630 --> 02:12:09.731
[SPEAKER_07]: So no matter what they do, people will find a way around it.

02:12:10.151 --> 02:12:12.732
[SPEAKER_06]: I got one more thought and then I'm sure you want to say something on this too.

02:12:12.873 --> 02:12:22.817
[SPEAKER_06]: My other thought would be I think the best way to probably stop piracy or at least curb it, I don't think you will ever stop it, but to curb it, I think you make it cheap, you make it stupid.

02:12:23.397 --> 02:12:26.699
[SPEAKER_06]: I would point at iTunes as an example of that.

02:12:26.860 --> 02:12:29.401
[SPEAKER_06]: iTunes kind of showed up in the wake of Napster.

02:12:29.441 --> 02:12:30.902
[SPEAKER_06]: Napster got shut down, obviously.

02:12:31.363 --> 02:12:34.745
[SPEAKER_06]: iTunes kind of showed up as a legitimate way of doing something like Napster.

02:12:35.005 --> 02:12:40.029
[SPEAKER_06]: And the cool thing about iTunes, and I think one reason why it's been very successful, it's easy enough for my mother to use.

02:12:40.389 --> 02:12:42.911
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cheap, 99 cents a song, and stupid.

02:12:43.191 --> 02:12:44.612
[SPEAKER_06]: Click button, purchase song.

02:12:45.072 --> 02:12:48.376
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's why digital distribution and things like Steam are starting to get more and more.

02:12:48.396 --> 02:12:58.406
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think Steam is going to pick up, pardon the pun, Steam, and you're going to see more, you know, these blowout sales, $9.99 for a game, click button, receive game.

02:12:59.449 --> 02:13:06.274
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, it gives you the illusion of having not really spent anything because you're not dealing with a tangible item.

02:13:06.674 --> 02:13:10.597
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not cashing out money using your card.

02:13:11.117 --> 02:13:13.579
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just clicking a button and there you go.

02:13:13.619 --> 02:13:17.762
[SPEAKER_02]: Your information is already there, which it does encourage people to spend more.

02:13:17.802 --> 02:13:20.104
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm guilty of the same, like Amazon's one click.

02:13:20.984 --> 02:13:21.645
[SPEAKER_02]: That gets me.

02:13:22.205 --> 02:13:24.766
[SPEAKER_02]: I buy books on Kindle and end up paying too much.

02:13:24.866 --> 02:13:26.327
[SPEAKER_06]: And look at the 360.

02:13:27.207 --> 02:13:29.888
[SPEAKER_06]: As Bobby lovingly refers to it, the Microsoft Space Bucks.

02:13:30.008 --> 02:13:32.369
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all just an elaborate illusion that you're spending real money.

02:13:32.830 --> 02:13:35.991
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, Caller, I know you probably have something you want to say on this.

02:13:36.071 --> 02:13:37.912
[SPEAKER_06]: What are your thoughts on your own question?

02:13:39.079 --> 02:13:43.941
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they need to take away the DRM and make it, like you said, make it cheaper and encourage people to buy it.

02:13:44.421 --> 02:13:56.444
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a painful experience with Bioshock when I first bought it because you can install it like five times and you have to do an online activation and after five times you have to call in and if you want to

02:13:57.369 --> 02:13:57.509
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude,

02:14:12.409 --> 02:14:13.049
[SPEAKER_00]: Bingo.

02:14:13.189 --> 02:14:13.710
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm with you.

02:14:13.810 --> 02:14:17.872
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's almost like our last caller, the guy who's having problems with his video content.

02:14:17.912 --> 02:14:22.835
[SPEAKER_06]: He's being punished for his hardware breaking and him trying to support things and do things the legal way.

02:14:23.115 --> 02:14:31.420
[SPEAKER_06]: You expect anybody to support your – and that's why I said, dude, Spazinator, if it stops working, you need to just stop supporting Sony like that.

02:14:31.620 --> 02:14:34.442
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean he champions for Sony a lot on this show.

02:14:34.722 --> 02:14:36.263
[SPEAKER_06]: But if they're not going to return the favor to him –

02:14:36.823 --> 02:14:54.175
[SPEAKER_06]: they can go F themselves and we should bring it to light that if you use the Sony Video Marketplace to buy content it could possibly be a ticking time bomb hopefully it comes out next week that this was all just a big scare from a bonehead rep at Sony let's hope

02:14:55.777 --> 02:14:56.057
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow.

02:14:56.998 --> 02:14:58.819
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm not going to take up more of your time.

02:14:59.199 --> 02:15:03.422
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to wish you a happy belated Valentine's Day and say goodbye.

02:15:03.562 --> 02:15:04.963
[SPEAKER_06]: You're still in time here in the U.S.

02:15:05.023 --> 02:15:06.724
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 8.30 and it's still Valentine's Day here.

02:15:06.784 --> 02:15:07.864
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you very much for the call.

02:15:07.904 --> 02:15:08.725
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost 6 a.m.

02:15:08.765 --> 02:15:08.925
[SPEAKER_00]: here.

02:15:10.046 --> 02:15:11.286
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for staying up late.

02:15:11.567 --> 02:15:12.067
[SPEAKER_06]: It means a lot.

02:15:12.087 --> 02:15:12.467
[SPEAKER_06]: No worries.

02:15:12.867 --> 02:15:13.148
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:15:13.428 --> 02:15:13.988
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one, buddy.

02:15:14.769 --> 02:15:14.969
[SPEAKER_06]: Same.

02:15:15.189 --> 02:15:15.329
[SPEAKER_06]: Night.

02:15:16.243 --> 02:15:35.673
[SPEAKER_06]: I love first time callers and you know what I think that's the perfect way to end the Skype line tonight so I'm sorry to those guys that didn't get through tonight remember you still can send us tweets you can send us emails there are tons of other ways to interact with the show but I think let's let's end it on a first time caller tonight that was that was a good note to end on and a good topic very good topic kind of it's it's interesting how those two calls related tonight isn't it

02:15:36.525 --> 02:15:37.826
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, last minute stories.

02:15:37.866 --> 02:15:39.747
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, I know you've got to have some last minute stories over there.

02:15:40.548 --> 02:15:40.708
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

02:15:41.548 --> 02:15:41.788
[SPEAKER_06]: No?

02:15:42.489 --> 02:15:44.930
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I just wasn't paying attention.

02:15:45.691 --> 02:15:47.672
[SPEAKER_07]: Jerk.

02:15:48.513 --> 02:15:52.275
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure we've got something, but I just have to look it up.

02:15:53.956 --> 02:15:56.217
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, do you have any last minute stories for the night?

02:15:56.498 --> 02:15:56.898
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

02:15:57.198 --> 02:15:58.539
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm almost done with this hat.

02:16:00.020 --> 02:16:01.061
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a quick programming note.

02:16:01.161 --> 02:16:08.887
[SPEAKER_06]: Next week, we are still planning on having a show next week, but I just want to warn folks, if things get delayed or something weird happens, it could happen.

02:16:09.167 --> 02:16:11.389
[SPEAKER_06]: This is live, really, not so much podcast.

02:16:12.129 --> 02:16:13.651
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm moving next week.

02:16:13.771 --> 02:16:19.515
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I have movers that are supposed to be able to do it all in the morning, but just if weird stuff happens, yeah.

02:16:19.795 --> 02:16:25.340
[SPEAKER_06]: The podcast could also be delayed a little bit next week because I may not have internet at my new place right away.

02:16:25.900 --> 02:16:30.303
[SPEAKER_06]: but if worse comes to worse I'll just come over here to Casa de Jamie and take care of things over here.

02:16:30.343 --> 02:16:31.364
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure she won't mind.

02:16:31.844 --> 02:16:34.046
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll make hats together and upload podcasts.

02:16:34.086 --> 02:16:34.546
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be fun.

02:16:34.707 --> 02:16:35.627
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll teach you how to crochet.

02:16:36.268 --> 02:16:36.828
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be fun.

02:16:37.769 --> 02:16:42.132
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably be more productive than a lot of the things I stay at home and do like World of Warcraft and stuff.

02:16:42.572 --> 02:16:44.674
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright Loki, got any last minute stories for us?

02:16:44.734 --> 02:16:46.175
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we'll just cover a few things here.

02:16:47.175 --> 02:16:50.798
[SPEAKER_07]: Sam & Max, The Devil's Playground has been revealed by the OFLC.

02:16:51.939 --> 02:16:54.560
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, that leaked out when it got raided.

02:16:55.221 --> 02:17:01.065
[SPEAKER_07]: And the episode 1 of that series will now be entitled The Penal Zone.

02:17:01.705 --> 02:17:06.609
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's scheduled to be coming out later on, probably this year.

02:17:07.890 --> 02:17:07.990
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh...

02:17:09.634 --> 02:17:11.115
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here.

02:17:12.456 --> 02:17:22.102
[SPEAKER_07]: Holy Invasion of Privacy Batman is unfortunately going to have to change its name after a conflict with an existing IP.

02:17:22.483 --> 02:17:24.384
[SPEAKER_07]: In other words, Batman.

02:17:25.905 --> 02:17:32.149
[SPEAKER_07]: So now it has been changed to What Did I Do to Deserve This, My Lord?

02:17:32.750 --> 02:17:35.311
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, the sequel will be coming out very soon.

02:17:35.552 --> 02:17:37.293
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll include the original as well.

02:17:39.415 --> 02:17:55.412
[SPEAKER_07]: Square Enix has trademarked Deuce X Human Revolution possibly meaning that they're going to be doing a new game in that series and it's been a while it's weird to hear that Square Enix is doing that but I have to remember they absorbed Eidos so this is a little weird for me but okay

02:17:57.389 --> 02:18:11.221
[SPEAKER_07]: and then of course those of you who bought Darksiders early enough received a card with a code on it and the instructions of do not discard this card and you'll want to save this code.

02:18:11.561 --> 02:18:24.551
[SPEAKER_07]: It has been revealed though that that code will entitle you to a free copy of Red Faction Guerrilla for PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 and the offer will be available until the end of March 7th

02:18:25.752 --> 02:18:31.698
[SPEAKER_07]: and apparently no word on exactly when you'll receive those copies.

02:18:32.499 --> 02:18:45.971
[SPEAKER_07]: You will have to pay $5 for shipping, however, but still though, Red Faction Guerrilla is a pretty awesome game and no word if they're still printing those cards and if they're included in copies of the game as of right now.

02:18:48.374 --> 02:18:49.455
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's about it.

02:18:51.306 --> 02:18:51.787
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:18:52.267 --> 02:18:56.170
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's going to kind of start to wrap up another edition here.

02:18:56.190 --> 02:18:57.372
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I saw something else that's kind of funny.

02:18:57.452 --> 02:18:57.772
[SPEAKER_06]: Or not.

02:18:57.832 --> 02:18:58.713
[SPEAKER_06]: Real quick.

02:18:58.913 --> 02:19:00.134
[SPEAKER_07]: No, please, go ahead.

02:19:00.154 --> 02:19:04.838
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't see a link to it or anything, but apparently someone's developed an emulator for the NES.

02:19:05.239 --> 02:19:12.505
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now it doesn't have any audio in it yet, but they programmed it all in the Blu-ray Java app.

02:19:15.128 --> 02:19:22.118
[SPEAKER_07]: So it will actually be able to run on PlayStation 3s without modification using just a flash drive.

02:19:25.701 --> 02:19:26.321
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this out yet?

02:19:27.142 --> 02:19:28.002
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently it is.

02:19:28.082 --> 02:19:29.663
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't see a link to where it was at though.

02:19:30.643 --> 02:19:35.525
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't run, like I said, with sound yet, but it does run most of the ROMs.

02:19:35.665 --> 02:19:38.066
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only a matter of time then before they get the sound and everything.

02:19:38.146 --> 02:19:41.528
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's pretty awesome that they're able to program that and no modification.

02:19:42.208 --> 02:19:45.510
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully it plays smoothly because the PlayStation controller is a sweet controller.

02:19:45.570 --> 02:19:47.110
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love to play NES games with that.

02:19:48.211 --> 02:19:50.272
[SPEAKER_06]: Ones that I own the cartridge for, legitimately, of course.

02:19:50.432 --> 02:19:50.732
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

02:19:51.632 --> 02:19:51.973
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

02:19:52.713 --> 02:19:53.013
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:19:53.854 --> 02:19:57.015
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's going to do it for another edition here of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:19:57.115 --> 02:20:00.577
[SPEAKER_06]: But before we wrap things up, we've got to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:20:00.637 --> 02:20:02.878
[SPEAKER_06]: So, DarkSakura, do you have any final thoughts for us tonight?

02:20:03.599 --> 02:20:04.139
[SPEAKER_05]: I have one.

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:05.420
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

02:20:12.984 --> 02:20:13.364
[SPEAKER_06]: Sigh.

02:20:13.964 --> 02:20:14.865
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, your final thought.

02:20:17.395 --> 02:20:34.973
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to play more Borderlands my final thought is I'm getting hungry again I had a very lovely breakfast made for me this morning that was very filling but now you know that was a while ago so now I'm getting to the point where I'm like ooh tacos we'll see

02:20:35.538 --> 02:20:39.782
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, thank you guys so much for downloading our show or listening to us live and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you guys very much for continuing to spread the love.

02:20:55.194 --> 02:20:55.635
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all we ask.

02:20:56.535 --> 02:20:57.056
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to do it.

02:20:57.076 --> 02:20:59.778
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be back here next week with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
