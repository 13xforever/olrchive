00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,240
Tonight, February 7th, 2010, a new Sonic the Hedgehog game is announced.

2
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,360
Could you soon get premium Warcraft features on your iPhone?

3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:31,640
And what first-person shooter is coming to Facebook?

4
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,480
I hope it's a game where I can shoot all my old friends from high school.

5
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,680
Hey, welcome back!

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,120
You're listening to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,560
Apparently we're going to have to see theme songs.

8
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,160
We're still having audio fail, even a week after having all our fun new equipment here

9
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,160
in studio.

10
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,680
Anyway, hi, we are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture,

11
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,320
and the gamer lifestyle.

12
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,320
I'm here with you every week.

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,320
My name is Rob Roberts.

14
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,600
Joining me, as always, say hello to the lady shouting fail fail over there in the corner.

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,120
Our very own fail blog here in house, Dark Sakura.

16
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,120
Jamie.

17
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,120
Fail!

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,120
How are you?

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,560
I win.

20
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,560
And also joining us tonight, say hello to Cookie Master Loki.

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,560
Hello.

22
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,000
How you doing, Cookie Master Loki?

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,720
We're almost out of cookies.

24
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,720
All right.

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,520
So, just so you know, we've renamed Loki, at least for tonight anyway, Cookie Master

26
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,440
instead of Tech Master because he baked cookies and brought them.

27
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,320
And I don't know about Jamie, but I like it when people bring cookies to the show.

28
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,760
I like cookies.

29
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,760
Yes.

30
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,380
So, tonight he is Cookie Master Loki.

31
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,000
But I'm sure he'll talk about tech here and there as well.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,360
In fact, you've been kind of over there hammering on YouTube, right?

33
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,040
What's going on over there on YouTube, Loki?

34
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,600
Well, they just uploaded my new video and disabled all the audio because they're awesome

35
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,840
like that.

36
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,840
What happened?

37
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,840
Copyright music.

38
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,840
Yeah, copyright.

39
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,280
But there's tons of videos out there that have copyright music in them.

40
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,280
That's lame.

41
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,280
I'm sorry to hear that.

42
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,280
It's all right.

43
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,280
We'll find someplace else to upload it because YouTube sucks.

44
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,400
There you go.

45
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,440
Or you could just play the song backwards.

46
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,440
That's the other idea.

47
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,440
Then they won't know.

48
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,520
I just don't care.

49
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,160
I have a sad announcement real quick.

50
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,160
What's your sad announcement?

51
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,320
The person who is going to be our youngest guest host ever can't make it.

52
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,320
I'm sorry to hear it.

53
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,320
He fell asleep in the car and needs a new diaper.

54
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,720
I'm sorry to hear it.

55
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,200
What about video games, what do you have talked about tonight you think?

56
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,280
Probably daddy playing the game.

57
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,280
What game?

58
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,680
Well, right now I think Becky's husband, Chris is playing, um, Mass Effect.

59
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,720
I was gonna say everybody's playing Mass Effect 2.

60
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,720
Except us.

61
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,720
Yeah.

62
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,720
For some reason, I just kind of missed it.

63
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,720
Dan just went back and bought Bioshock.

64
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,720
Wow.

65
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,720
And he's been playing that.

66
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,640
Well, let's talk about our gaming weeks and what the kind of games we've been playing.

67
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,720
That's how we always start off the show.

68
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,360
But hey, if you are joining us live on this Sunday evening, uh, first of all, thank you.

69
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,360
Welcome.

70
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,360
And thanks for listening to us live.

71
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,760
I mean, if you're listening to us on the podcast, we still love that too.

72
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,760
So thank you guys very much.

73
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,360
But if you are listening live on this Sunday evening, Super Bowl Sunday, but you decided

74
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,120
to take a break from the Super Bowl list, join us in our chat room, chat dot orange

75
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,000
lounge radio.com to talk about all of tonight's video game topics, including the games we

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,360
have been playing dark soccer.

77
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,360
How was your gaming week?

78
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,400
I played a crap ton of Star Trek online, and then I realized, um, when I decided to go

79
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,520
on the quest to find deep space nine, that I just, my little character had been just

80
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,720
running around the promenade for about an hour and a half, just running around, doing

81
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,880
nothing, running around.

82
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,880
And that's about it.

83
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,400
Well, I just have some like solitaire.

84
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,280
You didn't play like actual solitaire on the computer?

85
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,000
I didn't even, Oh, on the iPhone, I was gonna say, do they even include solitaire on the

86
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
computer anymore?

87
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,760
Or is that, yeah, it's included that in spider solitaire and a few of it, few others hearts

88
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,280
and freestyle and all that crap.

89
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,280
All right.

90
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,440
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

91
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,560
It was pretty good.

92
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:45,560
I played more Borderlands and, um, that's still entertaining me.

93
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,040
Uh, more Grand Theft Auto finally made it.

94
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,980
I'm in the top 100 players now, um, for true skill rankings.

95
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,100
So I'm in like the mid nineties now for that.

96
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,600
That's pretty awesome.

97
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,400
And I'm working my way up just the cumulative, uh, ranked death match stats.

98
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,280
So, um, I think I'm, I don't know, varies depending on how much I play it.

99
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,360
Um, I think I'm around two 30 something right now.

100
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,760
Um, and then I purchased a Bioshock two.

101
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,160
So I played a little bit of that and that one's actually pretty cool.

102
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,340
Very similar obviously through the first game.

103
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,340
Now wait a minute.

104
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,680
I thought Bioshock two was now till Tuesday, but you have the hookup, right?

105
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,920
It's not out till Tuesday, but it's pretty awesome.

106
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:35,600
Um, so yeah, uh, definitely, um, we're checking out, especially if you'd like the first game.

107
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,760
It seems like there's going to be a lot of similarities between this game and the last

108
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,760
one.

109
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,760
But, um, so far I'm digging it.

110
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,760
I don't know.

111
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,360
Did they have multiplayer in this one?

112
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,360
They do.

113
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,360
Yeah.

114
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,360
Fun.

115
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,360
That's going to, that's going to be the big kicker right there.

116
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,520
Cause that was one kind of glaring omission in the first one and what a lot of people

117
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,520
were clamoring for.

118
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,760
So I think that's probably the whole sale of the game right there.

119
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,360
I don't know if I'll even play the multiplayer though.

120
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,360
I, it just doesn't seem like anything I'd be interested in.

121
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,360
Yeah, I know.

122
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,080
Whenever I play those multiplayer shooting games, I get raped in the face and that's

123
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,080
not a lot of fun.

124
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,080
Well, not necessarily that.

125
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,920
It just seems like tacked on or something, but whatever.

126
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,920
So that's it.

127
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,920
All right.

128
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,480
Um, my gaming week, kind of the same old stuff.

129
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,280
I've been playing more Bayonetta and world of Warcraft and um, you know, some of those

130
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,280
games.

131
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,080
The only new game I really checked out this week was one of the new Xbox live arcade games

132
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,400
that they have called chime.

133
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,640
Uh, somebody on Twitter had posted, Hey, if you like luminous, you should play chime.

134
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,520
And yeah, I could definitely see where somebody is making the comparisons between chime and

135
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,520
luminous.

136
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,720
They're both puzzle games.

137
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,160
They're both heavily involved with music.

138
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,120
They both have a beat line that sweeps across the screen and they have very similar looking

139
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,600
screens, might I say, uh, that affects the gameplay.

140
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,960
But where the games get very different is that, you know, you could say luminous is

141
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,780
somewhat of a Tetris inspired game.

142
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,960
Chime is like, I'm going to get really old school here and I bet half the listeners don't

143
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,160
even know what I'm talking about.

144
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,000
Chime is like the dallion Opus on the game boy.

145
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,960
Anyone ever played to dallion Opus?

146
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,960
Okay.

147
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,360
A while back.

148
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,360
Yeah.

149
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,640
It's one of these games here since you probably haven't played it.

150
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,640
Here's what it is.

151
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,820
It's basically like you have all these shapes that you're trying to put into and they're

152
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,400
all square based, but they might be in an L shape or a jagged shape and don't think

153
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,280
just Tetris pieces because sometimes they're like five or six blocks in a row.

154
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,520
Um, and uh, you, you try to fit them into this square or like, you know, some other

155
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,640
type of geometric shape.

156
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,640
I don't know.

157
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,600
It's kind of like tangrams, but all based around Tetris style shapes, if that makes

158
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,600
any sense at all.

159
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
I don't know.

160
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
You try to kind of fit them in there.

161
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:36,420
So Chime is about trying to make three by three squares as fast as you can out of these

162
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,320
odd shapes, which sound, it's a little harder than it sounds.

163
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:45,520
Um, and so as you build these squares on the play field, there's nothing to do with dropping

164
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,820
blocks or anything.

165
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:51,160
You, uh, actually have free form to put the, put things down wherever you want on the play

166
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,160
field.

167
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,400
Uh, but yeah, I have this odd fascination to still want to work from the ground up,

168
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,160
even though, um, the pieces don't fall or anything like that.

169
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,840
You just kind of can rotate them however you want and put them on the board.

170
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:08,720
Ray Iannami in our chatroom, chat.orangelandrater.com, uh, Tetro, Tetro, Tetromino's, I think it's

171
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,720
called.

172
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,720
I think that's it.

173
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
Yeah.

174
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,720
What you're talking about there.

175
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
Same kind of idea.

176
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,280
Um, so anyway, here's the thing is that as you build these blocks, your multiplier goes

177
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,760
up the faster you build them.

178
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,080
And, and oddly enough, yeah, it enhances the music as you build.

179
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:29,120
Uh, there's songs by Moby, one of the guys from Orbital, uh, Philip Glass has a song

180
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,860
in there, which I thought was totally random.

181
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,200
So there's some, actually some big name talent in the game, probably only about five songs

182
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,480
in the game, but it's only a $5 game and I don't know, maybe there'll be expansions later.

183
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:44,540
Um, but anyhow, the, the beat sweeper will kind of sweep out your crap if you leave it

184
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,540
behind too long.

185
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,800
Like if you've let these isolated pieces that didn't get formed into blocks, it, uh, the

186
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,120
beat sweeper will filter them out after it gets hit maybe like five times and then they

187
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,700
all flush out and you lose your multiplayer, multiplier.

188
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:03,160
So, um, it's good for cleaning up the board, but it's bad for your score.

189
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,000
So that's the gist of Chime.

190
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,280
Um, it's actually kind of a neat little puzzler.

191
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,520
I, I, I thought it was kind of cool and, uh, the music was very trancy, zoney, but I thought

192
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,880
it was decent for a game like that.

193
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,400
And best of all, it's only $5, even though it's only five songs.

194
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,280
Now here's the thing, is that the game is supposed to go for charity.

195
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,880
Like they, they really advertise heavily in the game that 60% of the purchase price goes

196
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,760
to these various children's charities and you can go online and look.

197
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,540
What I thought was a little weird though is that they actually, as part of the sales pitch

198
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:38,760
of the game say, buy this game and feel good about supporting charities.

199
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,440
Oh, and you get 50 gamer score just for buying the game.

200
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,680
Because there's an achievement that is called something like, and I'm paraphrasing here,

201
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,980
feel good about yourself, 50 gamer score.

202
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,840
You can feel good about yourself and the purchase you've made of this game.

203
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,920
And it just gives you basically 50 gamer score for, I guess, going to the title screen.

204
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,060
I thought that was a little weird, like, yeah, I get it.

205
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,060
It's for charity.

206
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,060
It's a good thing.

207
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,060
Da da da.

208
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:08,280
But you're essentially buying gamer score if you think about it that way and it's, it's

209
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,840
not that I necessarily have a problem with that, with the charity angle, but the fact

210
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,200
that it's kind of marketed like that is a little, I don't want to say off-putting, but

211
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,640
that's the best word I can think of.

212
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,280
I would say though that it's more of like a, just a little way of saying thank you for

213
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,480
your donation.

214
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,440
I think that badge should be worth zero gamer score if that's the case.

215
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,600
Like I'm okay with there being like a little badge of pride, like, yay, have your warm

216
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,640
fuzzies for buying our charity game.

217
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,460
But I don't think it should be worth any gamer score and I don't think they should be advertising

218
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,960
like, hey, if you buy this game, we'll give you 50 gamer score just for getting it.

219
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,960
Like, I don't know, for me that just kind of, it just seems like it opens the floodgates

220
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,600
to all this kind of like devious behavior.

221
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,140
Like I understand it's for charity and maybe like Microsoft kind of let them get away with

222
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,140
that for all that.

223
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,640
And I'm not trying to like knock the game.

224
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,600
It just, when I kind of looked at that, I kind of made one of those raised eyebrow faces

225
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,200
of that's, that ain't right, that, that ain't right.

226
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,240
But hey, it is for charity and heck, what games anymore are only five bucks on Xbox

227
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,880
Live and the music, you know, some good talent.

228
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,680
It's a little bit ambient and not, well, at least the demo song, like I don't know what

229
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,760
other songs are in the game.

230
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,200
I didn't watch the trailer or what have you.

231
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,640
So I'm assuming there's some other fast paced stuff.

232
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,920
But I think for just like a good little chill out game, five bucks is not asking too much.

233
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:30,120
And yeah, despite my little issue with the 50 gamer score for free, it is a feel good

234
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,160
thing that you can do like, hey, I bought this game and the money's going to charity.

235
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,480
So that's pretty cool.

236
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,920
So that was pretty much my gaming week, all things considered.

237
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,720
So those are pretty much the games I was playing.

238
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,720
How about you guys in chat?

239
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,400
How was your gaming week?

240
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:51,200
Some guys in chat kind of talking about the charity thing I was just talking about chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

241
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,800
Kevin DDR in chat says, only thing that irritated me was the different choice of pieces on different

242
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,800
songs.

243
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,440
I think that's something that fundamental to the gameplay strategy would stay consistent.

244
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,440
Interesting.

245
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,160
Kevin DDR said, also said, I assumed achievements generally got the amount of points based on

246
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,320
the relative difficulty of the achievement.

247
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,080
I guess, unfortunately, some developers don't want to do that.

248
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,880
Very good point because that 50 gamer score achievement is like the biggest one in that

249
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,520
game because they only have 200 to work with.

250
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,640
And the rest of the achievements are, some of them are fairly difficult, at least from

251
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,320
the little bit I played.

252
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,820
So there you go.

253
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,360
Some comments from chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

254
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,360
Some housekeeping tonight.

255
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,520
Of course, we always like to plug our Twitter and our Facebook, www.Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

256
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,200
If you want to follow us on Twitter, we do a segment of the show called Twitter topics

257
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,420
up a little later where you guys can get your questions and your story suggestions done

258
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,480
right here on the show.

259
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,400
We like to pitch ourselves as the show where every gamer has a voice.

260
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,680
So we want you guys to be heard.

261
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:53,300
Facebook is also another way you can follow us at Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.

262
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,920
And you can join our little Facebook club there.

263
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,400
And we like to post little updates with what's going on behind the scenes.

264
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,080
Plenty of other places you can interact with us.

265
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,040
If you want to see more, because we're on like Last.fm and Steam, if you want to see

266
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:09,860
everything, just head to our website, www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com and look at the little box in the corner that

267
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,160
says extended play.

268
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,260
And there's all these different links to all the places where we have little communities

269
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,260
and so forth.

270
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:21,600
Speaking of community, we want to thank the community at AllGames.com, www.AllGames.com.

271
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,520
It's All Games Radio and it's the place where we do tape our show live every Sunday night.

272
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,760
And as I always say on the show, if you don't like what you hear from us, maybe one of the

273
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,160
other shows on the network is more your cup of tea because as mentioned before, I think

274
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,680
Jamie mentioned, everybody she knows is playing Mass Effect 2, but we're all sitting here

275
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,480
going, well, we just really haven't been playing that because I've been too busy playing Bayonetta

276
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:47,520
and Raiding and Dark Soccer has been too busy playing Star Trek Online and so forth.

277
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,520
But I'm sure there's lots of other shows where they're talking about Mass Effect 2 nonstop.

278
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,320
So if that's more your cup of tea, hey, cool.

279
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,400
But if you do like our show, one last little plug, please visit iTunes, search for Orange

280
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,080
Lounge Radio and leave us a nice little review.

281
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:04,800
iTunes, by the way, recently changed the podcast page format to kind of match the rest of the

282
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,480
CDs and things in the marketplace.

283
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,160
So if you go visit Orange Lounge Radio, you can see like the most popular shows in our

284
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,740
feed and so forth, although I think it's a little early to really be tracking those type

285
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,720
of statistics, but I thought it was neat.

286
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,720
You can see the little cover arts of the shows that it suggests, like people who listen to

287
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,400
Orange Lounge Radio also like, and it shows all the little cover art.

288
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,100
You know who the number one show is that suggested?

289
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,240
People who also listen to Orange Lounge Radio also like, you know what the number one show

290
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,240
is?

291
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,240
In the list?

292
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,240
Any guesses?

293
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,240
Do tell.

294
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,000
Bobby Black Wolf, our good pal Bobby is the number one suggestion.

295
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,600
Of course he is because, you know, we're on right back to back on all games radio.

296
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,960
I'm sure we're number one on his list too.

297
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,400
All right.

298
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:49,160
Also getting information from our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat or

299
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,300
you can go to chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

300
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:56,400
Tiger Claw says, hey, this just in, Dante's Inferno ad just played during the fourth quarter

301
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,560
because they're watching the Super Bowl right now with the tagline, hell awaits, which if

302
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,840
I remember it, wasn't there some controversy that they weren't going to air that promo

303
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,840
because of the tagline?

304
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,040
They just made them edit it so it wasn't saying go to hell.

305
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,040
I see.

306
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,040
That's right.

307
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,040
It was going to say, go to hell.

308
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,040
Now it's hell awaits.

309
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,040
Who cares?

310
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,040
It doesn't matter.

311
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,040
Little weird.

312
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,040
I did play the demo for that game.

313
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,040
It was, it was neat.

314
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,720
It's kind of God of War-ish, but fun.

315
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,720
Yeah.

316
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,920
So not that, I mean, being God of War is not a bad thing.

317
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,920
All right.

318
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,160
Let's get into some gaming news.

319
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,900
Lots of gaming news this week, surprisingly enough, we're really starting to kind of kick

320
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:31,320
into the year and all the game news and Loki starting us off with some big news, right?

321
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,320
Yes.

322
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,720
Um, this is, I don't know if it's completely big news.

323
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,240
I mean, kind of, we could have figured this out pretty simple.

324
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,700
Uh, Project Needlemouse, you know, the project that they were working on that was a 2D Sonic

325
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,700
game.

326
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,700
Well, guess what?

327
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,700
It's Sonic 4.

328
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,600
Oh my God.

329
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,800
That's a surprise, except it's not.

330
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:55,140
Um, what is kind of unique about it is it's going to be available only as an episodic

331
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:58,320
game and it's available on all the different download services.

332
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:05,120
We wear PlayStation Network, Xbox Live, um, so it's kind of cool.

333
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:12,020
And I guess the first episode will be available this summer and, um, hopefully it's good.

334
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,080
I don't know.

335
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,820
I'm just not that excited about it.

336
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,820
That's all.

337
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:21,020
Is it because maybe there hasn't been like a really, really like OMG squee in my pants

338
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,800
exciting Sonic game?

339
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,020
Because they always say, oh, we're going to do what people wanted us to do.

340
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,120
And then they fuck it up somehow.

341
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,240
You know, it's, I don't know.

342
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,880
Some comments in our chat seem to agree.

343
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:39,040
Ray Iannami says, can Sega not fuck up Sonic 4?

344
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,880
Dark Sakura, I know you're a big Sonic fan girl.

345
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,880
What was your reaction to the trailer?

346
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,880
Squee?

347
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,080
I'm going to take a cookie.

348
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,520
Yeah, you better eat that last cookie before I do.

349
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,640
But here's, no, no, no, I don't need any more cookies.

350
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:58,800
But here, um, I have to admit, I, even though the trailer didn't show much, I mean, it just

351
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,800
kind of showed the whole idea of, hey, we're making a new Sonic game in the original Genesis

352
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,520
game canon, which we haven't touched in what, 15 years, I think.

353
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,040
So maybe longer than that.

354
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,040
I don't know.

355
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,040
But it is the updated model.

356
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,040
Right.

357
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,420
And what I thought was interesting is that, you know, the little glimpse of gameplay you

358
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:21,040
see was a very Sonic 3 corkscrew looking thing that just looked very souped up in 3d.

359
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,880
Like, it's interesting, Mega Man 9 has sort of opened the floodgates to this kind of stuff,

360
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,880
in a way.

361
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,880
I don't know.

362
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,640
Do you think this was inspired by the success of Mega Man 9, or do you think Sega's just

363
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,960
finally getting the hint?

364
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:36,360
People just want the old shit with a new coat of paint, or what?

365
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,720
Well, I've noticed, and this is almost with any type of genre, be it art, music, whatever,

366
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:47,280
a lot of times you get this going towards the bigger the better, the whole, you know,

367
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,560
brand new, shiny, 3d, whatever, digital.

368
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:56,600
But there comes a phase in everything that you go back to the old way of doing.

369
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,080
You know, you want the classic look, you want the classic play.

370
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,160
You know, else we wouldn't have, you know, Sonic 4, we wouldn't have the new Mega Man

371
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,160
games.

372
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,640
I mean, shoot, even art's done the same thing, like right after the Victorian age, you know,

373
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,360
we kind of around the same time there were people that were going back to the old handmade

374
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,780
way of doing things.

375
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,420
So I think it's just culture.

376
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,420
It's going to happen.

377
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,420
It was bound to happen.

378
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,880
History repeats itself kind of thing?

379
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,880
Exactly.

380
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,880
Interesting.

381
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,880
Some comments in chat.

382
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,480
Hitstun says, well, Sega did a great job with Outrun 2.

383
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,840
There is hope.

384
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,520
I'm not sure if we're thinking of the same game here, but there was an Outrun game.

385
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,520
I don't think it was Outrun 2.

386
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,160
There was an Outrun game on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.

387
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,800
Yeah, Outrun 2000, that was it.

388
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,800
Not that long ago.

389
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,200
And that was kind of cool.

390
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,340
Like for a, it wasn't like, OMG, best game ever.

391
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,840
But for it, like a little arcade racing game that kind of invoked the old style of Outrun,

392
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,880
I enjoyed it.

393
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,360
I think I did buy the full version and played it a little bit.

394
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,360
It was fun.

395
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,360
It had magical sound shower.

396
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,360
And that's the important thing.

397
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,360
It sure did.

398
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,360
It was.

399
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,360
It was magical sound shower.

400
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,360
Uh, let's see.

401
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,360
And some other comments in chat room.

402
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,920
Uh, Frisbee says, I think this is Sega's final try.

403
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,920
Interesting comment.

404
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:09,000
Do you think that if this doesn't live up to the hype that Sonic's done, it's, it's

405
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,120
a done franchise?

406
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,920
Bury it?

407
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,520
I think Sonic isn't going to die.

408
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,720
No, I don't think Sonic could die either.

409
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,920
Something to think about, even if Sonic 4 tanks, which I highly doubt it will, I think

410
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,080
they're doing the right thing and invoking the past here.

411
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,240
Even if, for whatever crazy ass reason Sonic 4 tanks, let's not forget, Mario and Sonic

412
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,280
at the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics and all that stuff was huge on the Nintendo

413
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,280
Wii.

414
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,400
So Sonic as a character, I think still has a lot of kind of clout, if you will.

415
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,480
It's just that oddly enough, if Sonic 4 were to tank, which again, I don't think it will,

416
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,600
uh, Sonic would mainly exist in Nintendo franchises.

417
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,360
Isn't that weird?

418
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,360
Little.

419
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:55,040
Like it blows my mind, you know, and I was gaming back in the day, you know, as all of

420
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,640
his hosts were back in, you know, 90 and 91 when all these systems was Mario versus Sonic

421
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,640
and so forth.

422
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,800
It'd just be interesting if Sonic 4 were to tank, I think Sonic would just kind of have

423
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,720
to become a Nintendo character in all their games.

424
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,720
That'd pretty much be how it would exist, but I don't think it will tank.

425
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,320
What about the episodic nature of the game?

426
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,400
Do you think the episodic nature is a little weird or do you think that's just where games

427
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,080
are going these days?

428
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,540
I think it's just the way things are going.

429
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:23,840
It's gonna suck for them because now, since they're not putting out a full retail version,

430
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,020
I'm assuming it's gonna be cheaper and if people really hate the game, they're not out

431
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,720
as much money.

432
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,080
Which is good for the consumer, bad for Sega.

433
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,680
Do you think maybe they're just doing this so that by the time they put out episode 1,

434
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,560
episode 2, episode 3, they make about as much money as they would have if they just put

435
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,360
the game out on DVD, Blu-ray?

436
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:48,000
Pretty much, but that's assuming if everybody buys all the, you know, parts to it.

437
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I guess that's a good point.

438
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,640
Alright, chat.orangehonestrader.com if you want to comment on this.

439
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,520
Was there anything else for this story, Loki, you wanted to add?

440
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,880
Yeah, I was also gonna say that one other platform that it's supposed to be coming out

441
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,640
on is the iPhone and that's kind of typical with anything nowadays.

442
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,200
Of course, I'm gonna assume since it's on the iPhone, it's gonna control like shit.

443
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,200
That's just my guess.

444
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,320
That is a little weird that it's coming to the iPhone because, you know, I'm not a big

445
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,120
fan of all these games getting adapted to the iPhone because the touch thing is a little

446
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,120
weird.

447
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,120
But, I don't know.

448
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,160
Some comments, more comments from our chat room, chat.orangehonestrader.com.

449
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,840
Tigerclaw says, the fact that the game is episodic probably means you will have your

450
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,440
epic boss battle against Doc Robotnik.

451
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,440
Wasn't that a given?

452
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,160
You have every stage, you always have to have your Doc Robotnik battle at the end?

453
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,560
That's every stage, right?

454
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:44,040
Oh, Tigerclaw says, actually, he's correcting that you will not have your epic boss battle

455
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,560
against Doc Robotnik.

456
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,520
So maybe that like you have like mini-bosses.

457
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,520
I don't know how that would work.

458
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,080
SSJ100Matt says, it should have Michael Jackson music in it.

459
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,140
Well, I don't know if that's gonna be very possible at this point unless they were working

460
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:04,360
in secret, you know, more than a year ago, but I somehow doubt that is the case.

461
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:09,220
Well, I think all of us in studio kind of agree though we will pick up Sonic 4, at least

462
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,220
check it out.

463
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:14,240
I know I will, because I do love the old Sonic games and I'm all about checking out the new

464
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,240
one.

465
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,680
I'm sure, I know Jamie's gonna buy it, I don't even have to ask her.

466
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,200
Matt, will you buy it?

467
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,200
Nope.

468
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,200
One hold out.

469
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,540
Why not, dare I ask?

470
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:28,080
Because I haven't bought any of the Sonic games, I just don't care.

471
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,320
All right.

472
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,920
It's not really a game that I really got into.

473
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:37,640
Well, maybe Loki will care about this, I know I sure did because I let out the biggest fangirl

474
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:42,540
scream when I saw this, like seriously, I'm not even joking, when I saw this last week.

475
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:46,000
Talk about out of right field, okay, this came out of nowhere.

476
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,520
Sunsoft, remember they reformed, not that long ago, announced that Blaster Master Overdrive

477
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,880
is on its way out.

478
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:59,200
That's right, a remade new version of Blaster Master, although I do not believe this is

479
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,320
like a remake.

480
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,040
It is actually a sequel of the NES classic, we're just kind of forgetting that, you know,

481
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:09,280
Blaster Master 2 on Genesis and the Game Boy one never happened, but this is the sequel

482
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,880
to Blaster Master will be coming out on WiiWare for 1000 Wii points.

483
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,000
Here's what I think is the biggest twist out of this whole thing.

484
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,720
They said, oh yeah, and the game, it's coming out Monday, as in tomorrow.

485
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,920
As in, we've kept this a secret for however long we've been working on this and hey, now

486
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,360
it's out now, you can buy it.

487
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,760
And there's even a little trailer out there that shows some of the gameplay, I'm playing

488
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:38,640
a little bit of it in studio because awesome enough, it has a remixed version of the theme.

489
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,840
I don't like the remixed version of the theme, it kind of like fucks it up.

490
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,120
You know what, nothing is ever going to be as good as the original, that's really what

491
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,120
it is.

492
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,120
I don't like this one at all.

493
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,160
But this is not bad, it could have been a lot worse.

494
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:59,200
But you could definitely see it 16 by 9, the overhead stages look a lot different.

495
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,880
I don't know, this game just kind of has more of a Metroid look to it, which I'm all over

496
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,880
that.

497
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,880
That's pretty sweet.

498
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,920
Yeah, it's like some of these overhead levels have like ice themes and kind of like more

499
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:20,680
cavern themes, whereas I don't remember that being the case in the first one.

500
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:26,520
So yeah, Blaster Master Overdrive out Monday and yeah, you should have been there when

501
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,520
I read this.

502
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,600
I was just like, oh my god, oh my god.

503
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,320
I started flailing all about, it's pretty cool.

504
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,160
So yeah, 1000 Wii points and that comes out on Monday.

505
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,760
I'm assuming Loki's not going to be buying that, but I will.

506
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,760
Probably not.

507
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,760
Dark Sakura?

508
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,400
Yeah, maybe, they'll probably be up Dan Valley.

509
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,080
Now Loki, which would you rather play, Sonic 4 or Blaster Master Overdrive?

510
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,080
Blaster Master.

511
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,080
Oh, okay.

512
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,280
I had to ask, I had to.

513
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,920
Dark Sakura, what do you got?

514
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,600
Well it was bound to happen, I think that it was expected, you know, maybe sooner rather

515
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:08,280
than now, but Xbox Live is going to be canceling out support for the original console and that's

516
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,040
going into effect on April 15th.

517
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:17,320
And it's also not just the console, but for games that are compatible with both the 360

518
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,960
and the old Xbox.

519
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:25,320
So they're basically saying that because more people now are really on the Xbox 360, that

520
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:30,080
that's what they want to focus their power on and cut the support so they can focus more

521
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,880
fully on the newer system.

522
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,920
In other words, buy Halo 2, because that's, yeah, that's really the Xbox game everybody's

523
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,920
still playing.

524
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,160
I mean, yeah, I guess there's some others, maybe Counter Strike and a few others here

525
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,640
and there, but it's really all about the Halo 2.

526
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,080
Yeah, they were saying that Halo 2 was the top usage.

527
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:51,000
I think Halo 2's been the top game on Xbox, original Xbox of course, ever since the game

528
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
came out.

529
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,960
And you know, there's a lot of people that feel that Halo 3 did not really, and I would

530
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,200
say I'm one of them, didn't really live up to Halo 2 in some ways.

531
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,040
Well they're saying also that the other big thing is that the changes that they want to

532
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:06,780
make to the service are, as I say, incompatible with the original games, with the old games.

533
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:10,800
And I think a lot of people are already aware of this, but just in case you hadn't heard,

534
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:15,940
one of those big hindrances is that, you know, a lot of people asking, when can we have more

535
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,900
than a hundred people on our friends list?

536
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,220
We want to increase the number of people on the friends list.

537
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:24,140
And the reason why they can't do it is because of original Xbox.

538
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:29,820
It's basically hardwired into games like Halo 2 and so forth that Xbox Live only has a hundred

539
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,340
slots on it, basically.

540
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:36,760
So that's one of the big things that getting rid of the original Xbox games and shutting

541
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,380
down Halo 2 and so forth will free up.

542
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,400
And I would say by the end of the year, probably whenever the patch comes out for Natal, your

543
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:48,320
friends list is going to get a big bump and you'll be able to have 250, 500, maybe even

544
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,320
unlimited friends.

545
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,320
I don't know.

546
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,640
And I'm sure there are some other technical components that we're just not aware of because

547
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,840
we haven't thought of them yet, but there's some other things that they have to shut off

548
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,460
these games for.

549
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:04,380
But on the flip side, there's a lot of, as you can understand, ticked off people still

550
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:10,400
playing the original Xbox, still playing Halo 2, haven't upgraded to Xbox 360 yet that are

551
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,740
very sad about this news.

552
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,740
What do you guys think?

553
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,740
Too bad, so sad?

554
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,300
It's time to give it up and put it away?

555
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,160
Or do they make a case?

556
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,020
Maybe Microsoft needs to find a way to still support this.

557
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,020
Who cares?

558
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:26,300
I mean, seriously, how many people are still playing the original Xbox, upgrade, get a

559
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,300
new system?

560
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,900
I mean, it's bound to happen that they're going to shut off servers.

561
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:34,620
I mean, just because you're paying for it now, okay, great, you know, that you're paying

562
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:38,340
for it month to month, well, now you're not.

563
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,820
So I don't know.

564
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,580
I don't really feel sad about these people.

565
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:48,140
I do find it strange, okay, the original Xbox games couldn't be patched or whatever, I get

566
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:54,700
that, but I do find it strange that Microsoft won't find a way to still let Halo 2 be playable

567
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,540
on the 360.

568
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,540
You know what I mean?

569
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:01,780
Like via a patch or via, you know, because Halo 2 is an on-demand game, it's a download

570
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:06,940
game, so that you could fix it, so that you could still play it on Xbox 360 at least.

571
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:10,140
You know, fix whatever is the problem with the friends list and play it that way.

572
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,300
You would think they would do that, but they're not.

573
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:16,400
Tigerclaw does bring up a good point, though, in our chat room, chat.orangeontrated.com.

574
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,540
People can still play Halo 2 multiplayer if they get the PC version.

575
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:24,140
So, you know, Halo 2 is not forgotten for everybody.

576
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,540
Let's see, Hitstun in our chat says, if you have an original Xbox and it's not modded,

577
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,900
it's time to mod it.

578
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,980
And that also makes me think of the fact that, you know, you could also go the way of the

579
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:36,420
original Halo, and if you really want to play your Halo 2 or your Halo, it's time to break

580
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,420
out the LAN party.

581
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:40,340
You know, we still do that sometimes.

582
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,340
Yeah?

583
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,940
Yeah, we would have, like, the TVs all over the house, and the, actually, I'll tell you

584
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:51,860
what's funny, Dan's bachelor party was really a bunch of people over playing, you know,

585
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,740
all the systems on LAN, so.

586
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:58,100
GameGuru in chat is correcting me that Halo 2 isn't a game on demand.

587
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,740
My bad, I assumed that it was.

588
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:02,680
I guess Halo 1 is, but not Halo 2.

589
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,680
My bad.

590
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:09,220
Well, okay, but let me just say to that then, okay, make it a game on demand, and make it

591
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,220
so that it works.

592
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:13,500
It seems a little strange to me, but I guess maybe they want people to go PC.

593
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,500
I don't know.

594
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,780
XLink in our chat room says, EA does it all the time.

595
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,780
That's true.

596
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,060
EA shuts down servers for old games, and we kind of go, well, they're old, there's new

597
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:26,740
versions of the game out, and sure enough, there is Halo 3 and Halo ODST out at this

598
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,740
point.

599
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:33,420
I did like what Sega did when they closed the PSO servers, is that for the people that

600
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:38,500
were running private servers, they actually gave them a way to transfer characters and

601
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,500
things.

602
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,480
And I would think that if, you know, people are actually still playing that, then there

603
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,820
should be some other way to host your own server for it or something, you know, and

604
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,460
have that be like an external.

605
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:53,340
For some reason, I don't see Microsoft supporting that out of the companies.

606
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:57,380
Like, I could see why Sega would do that, but I could see why Microsoft would not, if

607
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,380
that makes sense.

608
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:02,140
And SHA100Matt in our chat room says, in the end, nothing lasts forever.

609
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,380
And I guess that's another point as well, is that, hey, you know, that game, you got

610
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,980
a good six or seven year run out of it, right?

611
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,500
No, no, wait, I'm saying too much.

612
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,540
That's how long Xbox Live has been around.

613
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,900
Halo 2 has probably been going, what, about four or five years?

614
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,900
About.

615
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,500
It came out while we were doing this show.

616
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,500
Oh, five is when it came out.

617
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,300
I played Halo 1 for the first time, and we were on the air, so it has been around for

618
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,300
five years now.

619
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,300
Five years.

620
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,700
That's a pretty good run.

621
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,380
Game Guru in chat says Microsoft will more than likely make Halo 2 an Xbox Live Arcade

622
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,380
title if anything.

623
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,380
I could see that.

624
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,380
I could see that.

625
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,380
That'd be kind of cool.

626
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,380
That would be kind of cool, actually.

627
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,820
That might actually bring me back to Halo 2.

628
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,820
I don't know.

629
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:42,420
Especially with some super graphics and so forth, but, oh well.

630
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:47,040
I think, again in chat, you said it good, nothing lasts forever, and some day they're

631
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,700
going to shut down the servers for all the games we're playing today.

632
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,260
Probably in five years when we've moved on to the Xbox 720s and so forth.

633
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,540
I just wanted to tell a quick story real quick before we get into the next story, though,

634
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:01,220
and I think I've told this on the show before, in fact I know I have, but when Dark Soccer

635
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:05,020
brought up the LAN party and the things her husband did, I have to talk about the first

636
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,320
time I ever went to Dark Soccer's house.

637
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,900
Not this house, but the house she used to live in.

638
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,900
The two story apartment?

639
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,900
In the ghetto.

640
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,900
Or the hood house?

641
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,900
In the ghetto.

642
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,900
Oh, with the big vaulted ceiling and the bad carpet?

643
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,900
Yes.

644
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,900
Yeah.

645
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,020
And it was the first time I believe I ever met your husband and George and some of the

646
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,500
friends that your husband hangs out with.

647
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,340
I walked in the house.

648
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:26,660
There's TVs all over the house, like a TV on the kitchen table, a TV in the living room.

649
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,660
The nest party.

650
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,660
A TV everywhere.

651
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:34,140
And they all had Nintendos hooked up and I was like, what the hell is going on here?

652
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:38,420
And Jamie's like, they're having a LAN party, a local area Nintendo party.

653
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:42,540
All these TVs had Nintendo systems hooked up and they were playing the Legend of Zelda.

654
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:48,080
And I guess they were having a contest to see who could beat the Legend of Zelda first.

655
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,560
And some people were like already on the seventh dungeon, like I think your husband was really

656
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,560
far ahead.

657
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,560
I think Dan actually won that one.

658
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,560
I'm sure he did.

659
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,900
And some people were still struggling.

660
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,940
They were on like dungeon three and some people were in the overworld, so I couldn't really

661
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:03,260
tell where they were at, but I just remember thinking that is the fucking coolest thing

662
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,520
I've ever seen.

663
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,580
Like I was like, Jamie and I are going to get along just fine because this had to be

664
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,900
about a year before we started OLR.

665
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:13,660
I mean, it was, it was a while before OLR, but I was just remember thinking, wow, this

666
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,100
is all kinds of awesome.

667
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,020
I kind of miss that house except don't miss where it was.

668
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,020
Yeah.

669
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,860
So anyway, I just wanted to tell that story if you never heard it before here on the show

670
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,460
because I always think that's hilarious.

671
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:30,300
And I would, I would love nothing more than to see another LAN party happen somewhere

672
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,300
somehow.

673
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,300
I think that would be a lot of fun.

674
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:36,220
So if there's ever, if Dan ever decides he's doing another Nintendo party, I want in.

675
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:41,180
I have to bring my FC mobile because keep in mind that we probably got three other NESs

676
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,660
and you have, you have an NES.

677
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,660
Well that's right.

678
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,660
I do have the NES.

679
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,500
I do have that, but I don't have a Zelda cart, but we can get one.

680
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,620
Like I've got like three of them hanging around somewhere.

681
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:53,900
One of the batteries I think finally died in one of them, but we've also got Zelda two.

682
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:57,580
Those batteries were only guaranteed to last like five years, but most of them have lasted

683
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,580
like 20.

684
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,580
Yeah.

685
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,580
Pretty crazy.

686
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,580
All right.

687
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,580
Anyhow.

688
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,580
Sorry guys.

689
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,580
Got a little tangent, but that happens here on this show sometimes.

690
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,820
Uh, Loki, bring us back with some more gaming news.

691
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,820
Yes.

692
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:13,780
Um, so you know, Facebook's been getting a lot of games recently and a lot of them been

693
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:18,460
pretty basic and they're starting to get some better stuff like new with new civilization

694
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:24,080
game and whatnot, but now they're actually getting a first person shooter game.

695
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,380
This game's called Brave Arms and actually looks kind of cool.

696
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:33,300
Kind of like a, I don't know if like the quake online stuff like quake zero or whatever,

697
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,700
but um, it's pretty cool.

698
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:42,700
It's from three G studios and um, apparently it's set to come out in March and it's kind

699
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:49,700
of similar to like a doom quake halo call of duty and that's what they should just call

700
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,540
the game doom quake halo call of duty.

701
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,540
Yeah.

702
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,540
Nice.

703
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:59,340
So see, when I first read about this, you know what kind of made me laugh as I imagined

704
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:03,300
because most of the games that you play on Facebook, like the Farmville's and the Yo

705
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:09,020
Ville's and the, I don't know, whatever else, but jewel blitz even, you kind of play against

706
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:13,420
other people and other people's avatars and other people's default user pictures and so

707
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,420
forth.

708
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:18,000
Like the image I got in my mind when I first heard this story is that I could actually

709
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,460
shoot my friends like their little face pictures on like bodies.

710
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,460
Wouldn't that be funny?

711
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,460
That would be funny.

712
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,460
That would be hilarious.

713
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,460
But that's probably not what this is.

714
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,460
Is it?

715
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,460
No, it's more traditional.

716
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,460
Somebody should make that game on Facebook.

717
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:35,060
Patent pending, patent pending, Loki, would you play a game like that for free?

718
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,900
I think I, I check it out at least.

719
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:41,620
I played, um, quake, um, I can't remember that quake live.

720
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,580
I played that for a little bit when it first came out.

721
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,860
I thought it was cool cause it was based off quake three, which was like the best fricking

722
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,860
quake they ever did.

723
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,140
In fact, somebody in chat agrees with me.

724
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,140
Uh, let's see.

725
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,140
Who is it?

726
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,140
Ah, yes.

727
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,140
Zen thralls.

728
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,140
Zen says quake three arena.

729
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,140
Best land party game ever.

730
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,140
Period.

731
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,580
I was, it was one of the best, uh, over the internet games too.

732
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,100
Oh, it was a lot of fun to play.

733
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,500
I had a good time with that one.

734
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,700
We'll see how this Facebook game goes, but I'm telling you guys this.

735
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,740
This is the direction gaming's moving.

736
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:12,820
Facebook as a platform for, for gaming.

737
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:17,620
Pretty soon you're going to be talking Xbox 360, Wii, PS3, PC, and Facebook gaming.

738
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,620
Oh, and iPhones.

739
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,060
You got to throw that in there too.

740
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:24,900
Facebook is like a serious platform for gaming.

741
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,900
Believe it or not.

742
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,900
Uh, one thing to take very seriously as a lot of people do is world of Warcraft and

743
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,820
some people take the auction house dealings very seriously.

744
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,220
In fact, some people kind of play the economy.

745
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,140
It's like the game.

746
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:40,260
Like I don't really, I don't really get into the whole auction house dealings, so I'm not

747
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,420
sure exactly what they do, but I guess it's kind of like the stock stock market.

748
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:48,120
You buy items that are plentiful and then when they're not available, you sell them

749
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,460
at a high profit is basically what it is.

750
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,940
Well, people that play world of Warcraft for the auctions and for the markets are in for

751
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,620
a big surprise because guess what?

752
00:34:56,620 --> 00:35:01,060
Apparently Blizzard has announced this week that soon you are going to be able to manage

753
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:08,540
your auctions from world of Warcraft using the armory application on the iPhone or iPod

754
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,280
touch.

755
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,580
We don't know much about exactly how this will work yet.

756
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,060
You know, we don't know the specifics.

757
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,780
Like can you access your in game mail too?

758
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,940
Because that's the only way you get the money from your auctions or you know, how would

759
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,260
you post something if you can't access your character's bags or what have you.

760
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,960
We don't know the answer to all the specifics yet.

761
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,800
We just know that Blizzard is throwing out that idea of you could play the economical

762
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,140
game of world of Warcraft on the go.

763
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,140
Interesting.

764
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:36,860
But of course, one thing they are saying with this as well is that it will cost money.

765
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:39,660
It's going to be a premium based service.

766
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:43,200
They've said premium based, which you know that means cost money.

767
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,500
Don't know if that'll be a monthly thing that you add on for your character or what I would

768
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:51,460
assume would be the option would be you charge for the app on the iPhone.

769
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:54,340
If you're going to be releasing this on the iPhone, you're going to charge $9.99 for the

770
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,160
app or something like that.

771
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,180
That's how they will make their money.

772
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:02,060
Dark Sakura, I know you're not a big WoW player anymore, but let's say they had an equivalent

773
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,860
in Star Trek online, or let's imagine you did still play WoW.

774
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,020
Do you think this is the kind of thing you'd be interested in?

775
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,120
As long as it's free.

776
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,120
But it's not.

777
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,620
So you wouldn't pay a premium for it?

778
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,620
No, I wouldn't.

779
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,620
Why do you think someone would-

780
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:18,720
Then again, this is the person who just bought, you know, a thousand cryptic points.

781
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,500
Why do you think someone would be into this?

782
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,700
Why do you think someone would say, hey, because I'm looking at this going, you know, as awesome

783
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:28,220
as this feature sounds, and depending on the cost, I might just, like if it is just like

784
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:31,660
five bucks for the app, I might just buy it to check it out.

785
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,580
I don't see myself really using it.

786
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:36,180
Like it's kind of weird to be using that on the phone.

787
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:42,300
I was trying to look at the page for, you know, what the interface and everything.

788
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,420
Well, they don't have that yet.

789
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,660
It's all they've said now is an announcement.

790
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:50,980
I used the armory itself, but I don't know.

791
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,860
I'm not that obsessed about the games I play.

792
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,580
I mean, really, it's something for addicts.

793
00:36:55,580 --> 00:37:00,740
Loki, I know you're not a big MMO player anymore, but let's assume this was five years ago and

794
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,100
this is a Final Fantasy XI Auction House app.

795
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,100
What do you think?

796
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,500
Well, it's an app for an iPhone or something like that, right?

797
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,940
Well, yeah, but let's say it was something you could access on the web too or something.

798
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:11,940
I don't know.

799
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,940
No.

800
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,940
No?

801
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,940
Not for you?

802
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,940
Not for me.

803
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,940
That's why I go into game.

804
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,940
Good point.

805
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:22,580
I have to admit, although I might be willing to just kind of check it out if, you know,

806
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:26,740
just for the sake of checking it out, I don't know if I'd want to pay a monthly fee just

807
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,740
to manage my auctions.

808
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,220
I mean, that's kind of what.

809
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:34,260
And the other thing that kind of worries me, this is like my one little weird worry and

810
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:37,900
I don't know, maybe the chatters can tell me if I'm being irrational with this, but

811
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:42,460
I kind of always thought this was how a lot of the gold farmers made their money.

812
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:48,780
So by kind of allowing folks to do this without being actually in the game, could you possibly

813
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:52,720
be encouraging the gold farming community and the people that are hacking and stealing

814
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,080
accounts?

815
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:58,860
Is that an irrational line of thought or do I have a legitimate concern there?

816
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,460
I don't know.

817
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,460
You tell me.

818
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,460
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

819
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:05,840
We'll get to some of that feedback in just a moment, but we'll move on with the news

820
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,840
for now.

821
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:15,220
Now, you remember when we were talking about Akira Yamaoka leaving Konami?

822
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:24,740
Well, we know where he ended up, is with Grasshopper Manufacture and is supposed to be doing music

823
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:32,220
for an upcoming horror game that they're doing that's produced by Shinji Mikami.

824
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:40,140
So maybe it's going to be going back to more of a game that has the feel of the older Silent

825
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:46,100
Hill, you know, not necessarily the kind of Americanized ones now, you know what I mean?

826
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:51,900
But just if it puts anything in perspective, Grasshopper did Fatal Frame 4 and No More

827
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,900
Heroes 2.

828
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:58,220
Do you know that they have the translation project for Fatal Frame 4?

829
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,220
Yeah, it's really good.

830
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:02,580
Yeah, I think we covered that a few weeks ago, probably about a month ago on the show.

831
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,580
Yeah, I remember that.

832
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,580
So I think that's pretty cool.

833
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:11,820
If that's the kind of game he's going to work on, then perhaps it's a worthy thing that

834
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,820
he's jumped ship.

835
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:18,700
I don't know where I read this, and it's probably just one of those fan wank rumors, I don't

836
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,980
know, but I had heard that EA was courting Akira Yamaoka.

837
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:25,620
Well, EA is producing the game that Grasshopper's working on.

838
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,620
I see.

839
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:30,060
Maybe that's, maybe it was kind of jumping to conclusions type of thing.

840
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,060
Possibly.

841
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,060
That could be.

842
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:38,140
Probably to Akira Yamaoka getting to do whatever Silent Hilly horror game I'm sure EA would

843
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,460
be more than happy to publish.

844
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,780
Oh, I wouldn't doubt that at all.

845
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,780
Yeah.

846
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,780
Interesting.

847
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:47,580
I mean, that man is pretty much Silent Hill.

848
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:52,620
Going back to the chat room, chat.orangelandradiocomm and some of the comments from the auction

849
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:57,520
app for WoW, SSJ100 Matt in our chat room says, I bet there will be an auction house

850
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,820
app for Final Fantasy XIV.

851
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:04,820
You know, it will be interesting to see how Squeenix kind of embraces all this stuff that

852
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,900
WoW is doing.

853
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:11,460
They, they, I noticed for Eleven, especially towards the end, they tried to do some very

854
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:16,680
minor armory-ish stuff, like you could access link shell lists in game and basic character

855
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,620
information on the web, but the armory is really robust now, like you can even get like

856
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:24,920
pictures of your characters in the armory, like as they appear in game, like it renders

857
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,920
them.

858
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,920
Oh yeah, I thought it was cool.

859
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,100
And you can pose them in different poses, so when other people look at it, they'll see

860
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,100
it, which I think is kind of cool.

861
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,740
Like I have one of my characters blowing a kiss.

862
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,740
It's really cheesy.

863
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:37,860
Let's see, other comments from chat room, xlink says, I'm not buying it.

864
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:41,680
And it also says that he thought of the same thing that I was mentioning with the gold

865
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,140
farmers and that's why he's not using it.

866
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:50,860
Also was a quick shout out there from hitstun, does Dissida have any Final Fantasy XI characters?

867
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:55,580
SSJ100 Matt clarifying, yes, there's a quick cameo of a Final Fantasy XI character.

868
00:40:55,580 --> 00:41:01,820
Final Fantasy XI is tricky to do because there was no standard hero.

869
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:05,820
You were the hero and you could look a variety of different ways, you know, because you could

870
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,060
customize your character.

871
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:10,180
Although everyone had the same outfit over and over and over and over.

872
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,180
For real.

873
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,180
I mean the customization was very limited.

874
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:15,900
I did like, so seeing the male characters walking around in their leather mantis.

875
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,820
Yes, yes, there was always the, what were they called?

876
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:24,220
The bronze, or whatever, yeah, it looked like mantis, basically, who was running around

877
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,700
and it was really funny.

878
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,380
With a harness.

879
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,380
Yes.

880
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:35,100
Let's, let's, but some of like maybe the boss characters and some of the NPCs that you interact

881
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,100
with I could see being in the game.

882
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,100
I think that's what they were talking about.

883
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,100
I'm sure it is too.

884
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:41,500
As SSJ100 Matt clarifies, it's a Taru Taru, which...

885
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,980
It's one of the characters that's in the game.

886
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:46,200
Doesn't surprise me at all because Taru Taru is what everybody remembers.

887
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,820
And even in Final Fantasy XIV, they're going to have Taru Tarus, but they're not calling

888
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:53,580
them Taru Tarus, which is so weird to me, but...

889
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,580
It is absolutely retarded.

890
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:58,540
Whatever, hey, hey, whatever, as long as the game is good, I don't care.

891
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:01,500
Call them Sexy Chocolate for all I care.

892
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,500
Sexy Chocolate?

893
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,500
That's awesome.

894
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:10,220
I'm going to roll a Sexy Chocolate White Mage.

895
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,300
Where did I even get that?

896
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,300
I don't know.

897
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,300
Alright.

898
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,300
I have no idea.

899
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,300
You know what's funny?

900
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,860
You made me think about wrestling for the first time in a long time.

901
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,980
By talking about Sexy Chocolate White Mage?

902
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:27,260
There was a guy on there whose character's nickname was Sexual Chocolate.

903
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:31,660
That should be the name of a video game band.

904
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,660
Sexy Chocolate White Mage.

905
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:36,860
I don't know how that works, but...

906
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:39,300
Oh god, we need to do some release dates.

907
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,300
Goober!

908
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,300
Quick, please change the topic.

909
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,300
Help.

910
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,300
Okay.

911
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:47,080
Well, this isn't anything to do with Sexy Chocolate, but I guess since next week is

912
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:53,060
Valentine's week, and I guess it could be Sexy Chocolate, if you're into that kind of

913
00:42:53,060 --> 00:43:00,060
thing for Dante's Inferno, because nothing says Sexy Chocolate like tortured souls and

914
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:08,120
hell, of course that'll be out on Playstation 3 as the Divine Edition, because it's divinely

915
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:15,020
packed with extras, and the regular edition on Xbox 360.

916
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:21,500
And then of course, also that week there will be Star Ocean Last Hope International Edition,

917
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:26,220
which is on Playstation 3, basically the port of the game that came out on Xbox 360 last

918
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:27,220
year.

919
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:33,980
Family Party 30 Great Games Winter Fun, yet another party game compilation for the Wii.

920
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:38,260
World Cup of Pool coming to the DS.

921
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:42,180
Sheeran the Wanderer coming to the Wii, which looks pretty awesome.

922
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,660
That's from Atlus.

923
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:50,900
And of course, the big one for the week, BioShock 2, making its way out on PC, Playstation 3,

924
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,860
and Xbox 360.

925
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:58,260
Or if you're a teenage girl, perhaps Seen at Twilight is the big game for you this week.

926
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,540
That will be out on the DS.

927
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:07,700
And if you want none of those, or just own a Wii, then perhaps Super Monkey Ball Step

928
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,580
and Roll will be your type of game.

929
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,020
And that's coming out just on the Wii.

930
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:15,260
Low-key, you know how much it would amuse me, especially for the YouTube channel, if

931
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:19,500
we were to follow you with a camera, to one of those midnight releases for Dante's Inferno

932
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,120
or BioShock 2, because they're both coming out at the same time, right?

933
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,420
And then you walk up to the counter and ask for Seen at Twilight.

934
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:26,420
I would love that.

935
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:29,100
Except I wouldn't want to do that.

936
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:32,800
By the way, the reason why that's called the Divine Edition is because the Inferno was

937
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:40,060
part of the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri, so that's why it's called the Divine Version.

938
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:45,020
Which, I've read that in fifth grade.

939
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:49,660
I thought it was called the Divine Edition because it's like, you know, Sony's way of

940
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,940
saying, hey look, we have something exclusive!

941
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:52,940
Ah!

942
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:59,940
We may have lost Final Fantasy 13, and, you know, Residence of Fate, and all the other

943
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,620
games have come out, but hey, we've still got the Divine Edition!

944
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:05,660
You're not going to be able to get that download content until later.

945
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:08,540
They're just trying to be all literary and cultured and shit.

946
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:12,340
I thought they called it the Divine Edition because the Sexy Chocolate Edition just got

947
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:15,500
rejected, is what it was.

948
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:16,500
Fail.

949
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,500
Alright.

950
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,500
Hey!

951
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,500
Some other release dates for Japan.

952
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,540
Game coming out on the Xbox 360 this week.

953
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:27,740
Sacred 2 Fallen Angel makes its way to Japan this week, and I'm trying to see what kind

954
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:28,880
of game this is.

955
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,880
This is a...

956
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,880
It's a role-playing game.

957
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,780
Well, okay, I can see that, but I'm trying to figure out what more about this.

958
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:36,820
Is this like a Final Fantasy-ish kind of game?

959
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:39,540
The graphics look interesting, kind of like in a desert.

960
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,940
It came out here last year.

961
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:41,940
It sucked.

962
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:42,940
Alright.

963
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,940
Oh, there's like a not-chocobo in the game there that you can ride.

964
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,500
They don't localize this for the US, though, right?

965
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,500
It's a boca-cho!

966
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,500
Yeah!

967
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:53,320
One of the reviews, though, I'm reading online, this game is massive.

968
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,540
There's tons of quests, and the level cap is 200.

969
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:56,540
Who knows, though?

970
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:58,340
That was probably written by the publisher.

971
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:02,180
If you don't want to play that on the Xbox 360, you could check it out on PlayStation

972
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:06,140
3, because it's coming out there, too, as well as a game called Winter Sports 2010 The

973
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:07,700
Great Tournament.

974
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:12,260
I'm assuming that's like coming from a company who didn't get the Olympic license, but wants

975
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,180
to cash in on it anyway.

976
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:16,320
So there you go.

977
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:21,020
If you want, you could check out on the Nintendo Wii, Madworld makes its way for Japan this

978
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:22,020
week.

979
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:26,520
That is a Japanese localized release on the Nintendo Wii this week, coming from Sega.

980
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:30,260
And unfortunately, a lot of folks passed here, but maybe if it does very well in Japan, there'll

981
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:31,260
still be a sequel.

982
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:32,900
So you might want to consider picking that up.

983
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:40,420
On the Nintendo DS this week, Mina no Conveni comes out this week, and it is a strategy-based

984
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:45,280
game, but when I say that, it looks like a little girl going cooking.

985
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:51,460
It's not cooking mama, but kind of like cafeteria managing, maybe kind of a version of Diner

986
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,460
Dash, I don't know.

987
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:55,440
Kind of what it strikes me as from the pictures I see there.

988
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:01,060
Quickly taking a look at the PSP, Shin Sangoku Musou Multirade gets a price reduction.

989
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:04,460
That game is already out, but it's getting a little price cut this week.

990
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:06,740
It's Dynasty Warriors Strike Force.

991
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,100
That's what you might know the game better as.

992
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,740
Those are your Japanese release dates.

993
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:14,580
Dark Sakura, what's going on overseas in the UK the other way?

994
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:17,700
Well for the UK, we've got a few goodies.

995
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:22,060
We have Bioshock 2 on the 9th, and on the 10th, Darwinia.

996
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:26,780
And the 12th is Bleach the Third Phantom, Half Minute Hero, Phantasy Star Zero, Star

997
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:31,740
Ocean, The Last Hope, and Super Monkey Ball Step and Roll.

998
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:36,800
Alrighty, cool.

999
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,860
So this is kind of interesting.

1000
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:45,500
Apparently there is a developer resume that's hinting at an Xbox 360 version of Final Fantasy

1001
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,140
14.

1002
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:57,940
And apparently also this was being removed a few hours later, and apparently this profile

1003
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:05,900
that was on a website linked in for designer Yuki Akama referenced work on Final Fantasy

1004
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:09,460
14 for PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.

1005
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:16,140
Of course, only the PC and PS3 platforms have been officially confirmed to be coming out.

1006
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:20,140
And not only that, but Sony took great pride in last year's E3 at saying, you can only

1007
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:22,840
play this on the PlayStation 3.

1008
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:26,940
And leading many folks to question if the Xbox Live hurdle proved to be too much for

1009
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:30,740
Squeenix to deal with, although I'm sure Microsoft doesn't want to lose that.

1010
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:36,500
I'm sure we'll hear whether it's coming out on the 360 or not.

1011
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,940
Earlier this week I thought it was.

1012
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:40,820
Now you ever use the website linked in, Matt?

1013
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:41,820
No.

1014
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:45,740
It's kind of like a professional Facebook, I think is the best way I can describe it.

1015
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:49,960
I have a profile on there, and basically it's kind of like a place where you can post your

1016
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:55,260
resume and do job searches, but it's supposed to be a way to professionally connect with

1017
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:59,300
your coworkers and people they know and so forth.

1018
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:02,620
It's more of like a professional linked in, and there are quite a few of the gaming community

1019
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:03,620
uses that.

1020
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:07,740
I've connected with quite a few other podcast hosts and so forth on linked in.

1021
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:11,380
I'm sure it will come out on 360, it only makes sense.

1022
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:15,900
More people that they can get on the service, the better it is for them, so I don't see

1023
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,100
why they wouldn't.

1024
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:22,060
It just seems weird to me that Sony was so excited about it, and then just to lose this

1025
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:27,460
again, you know, because this would be twice in a row with the whole Final Fantasy 13 thing

1026
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:28,460
going to Xbox.

1027
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:32,340
That's going to be a blow to the ego.

1028
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:33,340
We'll see.

1029
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:40,100
Like I said, earlier this week there were reasons for me to believe that there might

1030
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:49,340
be a 360 version, but then those were soonly changed just by what I think, I don't know,

1031
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:53,260
my own opinion, if I could be vaguer than that.

1032
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:58,380
I think a version on the 360 could be eventually, but it would seem like that might come out

1033
00:49:58,380 --> 00:49:59,380
later.

1034
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:04,720
And here's the other thing, Squeenix doesn't seem to think that Final Fantasy will do well

1035
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:05,980
on 360 in Japan.

1036
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:10,580
Keep in mind, Final Fantasy 13, not happening on the 360 in Japan, or hasn't happened yet

1037
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:13,060
because the game's already out there.

1038
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:16,820
Maybe the same type of thing is happening where they're going to release Final Fantasy

1039
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:23,700
14 on the 360 here in America and only here in maybe Europe too.

1040
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:29,820
But maybe they don't want to hold up the debut of the game to make the 360 version.

1041
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:30,820
Does that make sense?

1042
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:32,980
Because they're going to do a worldwide launch this time.

1043
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:37,020
You know, 11 took like a year to get localized over here, but maybe Final Fantasy 14, they're

1044
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:39,020
going to throw it out there all at once.

1045
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:41,060
Japan, US, and Europe.

1046
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:43,740
Everybody gets it at once, and there'll be a 360 version someday.

1047
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:47,620
Would it be hilarious if it became a 360 exclusive?

1048
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:48,620
No way.

1049
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:49,620
No way.

1050
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:50,740
It would be hilarious though.

1051
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:57,520
Just considering how, you know, Final Fantasy 11 was really created as a PS2 game.

1052
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,140
It was really made for the PlayStation 2.

1053
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:04,580
I know a lot of us here in the States played it on the PC, but part of the reason that

1054
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:10,340
game was so limited and finally outgrew itself and couldn't expand the way that WoW has continued

1055
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:13,840
to expand is because it's limited to the PS2.

1056
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:19,060
And that's why Final Fantasy 11 is kind of, they're not going to really support that as

1057
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:20,060
much anymore.

1058
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:21,060
I'm sure it will always be alive.

1059
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:24,820
There will always be people playing Final Fantasy 11, but it's going to downsize big

1060
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:28,900
time when 14 comes out.

1061
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:30,140
And we'll see what happens.

1062
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:31,540
All right.

1063
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:34,940
One other story for you guys here, and then we're going to get to the classic game of

1064
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:35,940
the week.

1065
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:38,900
And this has to do with some rumors, and this is a big fat rumor.

1066
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:43,060
And this is also one of the rumors, I don't know, it seems kind of useless to talk about

1067
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:46,260
this on the show, but I thought I'd throw it out there because it is circulating around

1068
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,260
some blogs.

1069
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:53,480
But apparently there is a rumor going around that a quote, new Nintendo platform is going

1070
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:56,940
to be announced at the game developers conference.

1071
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:03,040
And that's in a story that was run by the website video gamer.com from an industry source,

1072
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:08,140
an employee at a major international publisher, obviously anonymous, as you can imagine, quote,

1073
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:12,860
just heard a rumor that you may be interested in Nintendo are going to announce a new platform

1074
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:14,320
at GDC.

1075
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:17,420
Some devs have already started work on it.

1076
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:21,060
So we don't know if that could be a redone handheld.

1077
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:26,700
I mean, I think we've already heard rumblings of a DS2, even though there's the Excel

1078
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:30,780
still has yet to come out here in the US, we've heard rumblings of a DS2.

1079
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:34,940
Some fanboys are hoping it's finally the Wii HD already.

1080
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:35,940
Who knows what it could be?

1081
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:38,540
Could it maybe be an enhancement to the existing Wii?

1082
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:43,580
Like I don't want to joke the vitality sensor, but something in that vein?

1083
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:44,620
Probably nothing like that.

1084
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,340
I don't know if they would do another Wii.

1085
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:49,460
I mean, because it's selling like hotcakes right now.

1086
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:54,260
What would be the point, you know, in trying to put some now I'd see maybe another handheld

1087
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:58,700
system because maybe that's starting to slow down a little bit, but I doubt they would

1088
00:52:58,700 --> 00:52:59,700
be doing a Wii.

1089
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:06,540
They're going to build one that you implant into your brain so you can just play until

1090
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:07,740
you have seizures.

1091
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:11,420
Unless they're trying to stay ahead, they're worried that maybe once these other motion

1092
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:18,660
controllers come out for Microsoft and PlayStation 3 and Sony, that you're going to have kind

1093
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:23,620
of an even playing field and then they're going to just fail based on the quality of

1094
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:27,300
their product because now you're going to have these really pretty looking games that

1095
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:32,220
control just like they do on the Wii and people are going to be more apt to maybe buying those,

1096
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:37,820
which I don't think that's true, but maybe they're just trying to stay one step ahead.

1097
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:44,120
So I don't know, either way, I'm not too excited about it.

1098
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:48,660
In our chatroom at chat.orangelandraday.com, MaginamiCon, I hope I said that right, says

1099
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:49,660
what?

1100
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:50,780
A phone?

1101
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:51,780
The end phone?

1102
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:53,500
Could that happen?

1103
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:59,100
I somehow doubt that, but that would be an interesting idea, sure.

1104
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:02,860
Interesting too, I kind of want to say if this is true, I don't think it's true.

1105
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:06,900
I think some things might happen behind closed doors at Game Developers Conference, but I

1106
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:09,860
don't think you're going to see the major announcement until E3.

1107
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:12,260
Game Developers Conference is not a media show.

1108
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:15,860
It doesn't strike me as the place to announce a new platform.

1109
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:20,980
The place to announce maybe a revision, I could see like a DSi XL or something there

1110
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:23,860
even though it's already out in Japan, but you know what I mean, like a slightly altered

1111
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:24,860
version.

1112
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:27,620
An enhancement or a new tool.

1113
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:32,020
Like I could see more Natal information coming out of GDC and some of the things that enhance

1114
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:37,380
gaming, but I don't see a full-on new platform being announced at Game Developers Conference.

1115
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:38,660
It's not a media show.

1116
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,660
It's for game developers.

1117
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:41,660
It's in the title.

1118
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:45,880
I know people think it's a media show and it's turning into one, but it's not supposed

1119
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:46,880
to be.

1120
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,260
It's really, really not, and I think a lot of people resent that it is.

1121
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:53,260
So I think if Nintendo is going to make an announcement, which I think it is the DS,

1122
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:59,100
I think the DS is going to get the revamp, you're going to see it at E3, not a Game Developers

1123
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,100
Conference.

1124
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:03,020
And yes, I know it is weird that I'm talking the DS revamp when we don't even have the

1125
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:08,540
XL here in the west, but I think Nintendo kind of knows that they could still put out

1126
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:12,060
the XL in limited quantities and it would sell if it was cheaper.

1127
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:17,900
It would still sell to the seven and eight year olds and the mothers that like to play

1128
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:22,860
Pokemon and whatever, the soccer moms, and whatever new DS system that will be $50 more

1129
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:28,340
expensive, maybe even $100 more expensive, will cater to the hardcore gamer who wants

1130
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:30,700
their Mario and Zelda games ASAP.

1131
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:31,700
Right?

1132
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:32,700
I don't know.

1133
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:33,700
Does that seem far-fetched to you guys?

1134
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:34,700
No.

1135
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:35,700
No.

1136
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,700
All right.

1137
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:37,700
Let's see.

1138
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:38,700
I'm sorry.

1139
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:42,220
I can't be too contrary about that.

1140
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:45,580
And some other comments in chat here, talking about MotionPlus, there's a couple of people

1141
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:47,580
bringing up MotionPlus.

1142
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:48,580
Was MotionPlus a flop?

1143
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:49,580
I don't know.

1144
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:50,840
That's a good question.

1145
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,020
Was MotionPlus a flop?

1146
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:54,640
What do you think, Loki, from your perspective in sales?

1147
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:59,340
Just that people, as far as rental stores and stuff go, they don't want to bring in

1148
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:02,420
games that have MotionPlus because they're afraid that people don't have it.

1149
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:04,300
It's kind of like the whole Guitar Hero thing.

1150
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:09,020
People don't want to bring it in because they're afraid that, oh, it requires this.

1151
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:11,520
It's not something that most people have.

1152
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,520
Is it a flop?

1153
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:16,580
I don't know if people are really all excited that, oh God, this game has MotionPlus now.

1154
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:17,580
It's going to be better.

1155
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,740
I don't really think it means anything yet.

1156
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:25,620
I mean, there's only been a few games that have actually used it, and I'm sure they're

1157
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:26,620
pretty good.

1158
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:31,540
It's just, it's not like game-changing or anything.

1159
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:33,960
Interesting comment from Blue Swim in our chat room.

1160
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,460
Interesting creative idea.

1161
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:39,460
Black Wii with groundbreaking DVD support.

1162
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:40,460
I don't know.

1163
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:41,460
I don't think anyone's going to care.

1164
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:45,740
I mean, most people are moving on to Blu-ray and stuff, and everything's a DVD player

1165
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:46,740
nowadays.

1166
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:50,700
Yeah, I think that's a creative outside-the-box answer for the topic at hand, but I just lean

1167
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:51,700
towards no.

1168
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:52,700
And I mean, seriously.

1169
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:53,700
I think Loki's right.

1170
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,700
Everything's a DVD player.

1171
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:55,700
DVD players are like 40 bucks, probably less than that.

1172
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:56,700
Wii's going to have Netflix.

1173
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:57,700
Yeah.

1174
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:00,060
It doesn't need a DVD player.

1175
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:06,540
It's a creative answer, but maybe a Wii revision was something else, but again, it's going

1176
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:07,800
to go the way of MotionPlus.

1177
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:11,560
The biggest problem with MotionPlus, it wasn't included with the console to begin with, so

1178
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,620
people are afraid not everyone has it.

1179
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:16,780
It's very hard to launch a peripheral.

1180
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:19,420
That's what Natal's uphill battle's going to be.

1181
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:24,660
That's why you read these articles and these rumors about the 360 is going to relaunch.

1182
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:29,380
It's not a new console per se, but they have to treat Natal like a relaunch of the damn

1183
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:30,380
system.

1184
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:34,140
There's ways they can really push the envelope with the Wii and make it very interesting,

1185
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:38,440
like using the whole head tracking and stuff like that, but they're just not doing it.

1186
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,700
They're not thinking outside the box.

1187
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:45,580
They don't need these extra add-ons like the Wii Vitality sensor, which is absolute shit.

1188
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:46,580
It's just going to be horrible.

1189
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:47,900
No one's going to buy it.

1190
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:50,900
It's just like the stupid pedometers for the DS.

1191
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:55,140
Yeah, there's going to be a few people like, oh good, I can exercise now.

1192
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:59,460
Yes, because you couldn't before.

1193
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:03,180
I don't understand why they need the add-on.

1194
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:06,700
The only thing I can think of is better graphics, maybe soup up the actual processor inside

1195
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:07,700
there.

1196
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:13,660
You know, because if they're hitting the limits of what they can do on that system, maybe

1197
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:14,660
that would help.

1198
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:20,980
But you know, like say the DSi for the Wii or something like that.

1199
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:25,780
But I'm afraid that whatever they do decide to put out is just going to be very gimmicky

1200
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:31,420
and stupid and it just gives them an excuse to put out another Mario game, another Metroid

1201
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:33,420
game, another Zelda game.

1202
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:35,860
And look, oh look, it's new, but it's not.

1203
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:36,860
I don't know.

1204
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:37,860
All right.

1205
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:40,540
Well, we're going to get into the classic game of the week here in just a moment and

1206
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:44,080
wrap up part A of our show, but I do want to say hello to all the folks who are tuning

1207
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,080
in live tonight.

1208
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:49,180
I guess the Super Bowl is over and so now we have some folks kind of coming back to

1209
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:50,620
us now that the football game is over.

1210
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:51,620
So welcome guys.

1211
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:52,620
Glad you could tune in tonight.

1212
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:55,500
I'm just going to recap quickly the things we have talked about tonight.

1213
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:59,560
Sorry to the podcast listeners, the folks that listen to us, it's the top of the show,

1214
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:01,380
but I want everyone to know what we've already covered.

1215
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:06,820
Sonic the Four episode one was already announced this week, was Project Needlemouse's other

1216
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:07,820
game.

1217
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:09,340
Blaster Master Overdrive has surprised us.

1218
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:11,460
It's going to be out on Monday.

1219
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:15,700
Xbox and Microsoft is ditching live support for the original Xbox.

1220
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:19,380
So Halo 2 fans are pissed, but the rest of us will gain a friends list of more than a

1221
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:20,940
hundred friends.

1222
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:24,580
Facebook is getting a new first person shooter game called Brave Arms.

1223
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:26,700
Facebook is a gaming platform, you betcha.

1224
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:32,100
Blizzard has been announcing teasing the idea of a premium auction house application for

1225
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:35,060
World of Warcraft so you can manage your auctions offline.

1226
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:38,540
Akira Yomoka has found a new home, he left Konami a couple months ago and now he's at

1227
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:41,900
Grasshopper working with the folks that did No More Heroes.

1228
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:47,540
We covered release dates, Final Fantasy XIV, a developer's LinkedIn profile has clued us

1229
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:52,420
into the fact that it could be under development for the 360, but we seem to come to a consensus

1230
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:56,580
that if it is under development for the 360, it probably won't come out at the same time.

1231
00:59:56,580 --> 01:00:00,600
And then we just wrapped up talking about a story where Nintendo, big, big rumor could

1232
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:06,180
be unveiling a new platform at GDC, but we all seem to think that that is not true.

1233
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:12,540
That it's probably some type of just kind of enhancement or new peripheral or some other,

1234
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:17,140
you know, slight little addition because Game Developers Conference is not a media show.

1235
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:18,140
It's just not.

1236
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:19,140
All right.

1237
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:21,820
Now we're going to get into the classic video game of the week.

1238
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:25,780
It's a chance for us to take a trip down memory lane and go down gaming's history, and Dark

1239
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:30,140
Sakura jumps into the vault and says, hey, ew, it's sticky.

1240
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:34,420
And here's a video game that you all should be playing.

1241
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:38,540
Dark Sakura, what is the classic video game of the week this week?

1242
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:42,060
I was going to do this the other week and I decided that I was going to do it this week.

1243
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:43,060
It's Qbert.

1244
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:44,060
Yeah.

1245
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:49,300
Qbert, where you play the little big nosed orange dude that has the, you know, curses

1246
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:53,820
like a sailor and gets jumped on by snakes and little green snot looking things.

1247
01:00:53,820 --> 01:01:00,340
Let's take a listen to Qbert and the awesome 1982 arcade noises.

1248
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:13,420
And he even got bonuses for the two discs on the side.

1249
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:14,420
Yep.

1250
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:16,660
I love the little sound that the disc makes.

1251
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:19,100
Yeah, that's some cussing.

1252
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:24,380
Anyway, so Qbert was originally supposed to be a game about Qbert's big nose that could

1253
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:25,380
shoot projectiles.

1254
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:29,860
And he would hop all over a pyramid that was actually made by Warren Davis.

1255
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:34,820
Instead, the shooting was taken out and he jumps and changes the colors on little platforms

1256
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:36,020
on a pyramid.

1257
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:40,180
The original project name was called Cubes and was sort of called Snots and Boogers for

1258
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:41,180
a while.

1259
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:45,940
And then the little cussing thing that Qbert says when he gets hit.

1260
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:48,340
I love the high score board, by the way.

1261
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:49,340
Hi there!

1262
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:50,700
In big letters.

1263
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:51,700
Hi there!

1264
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:54,180
Welcome to the Nozer Elite!

1265
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:57,980
Well, hello!

1266
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:03,540
So yeah, it is basically sort of puzzle and hopping around and, you know, the game actually

1267
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:08,420
gets really hard because, you know, your first few levels you only change it once and you've

1268
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:11,540
got enemies all over the board.

1269
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:15,780
Also, then you move on to it changing to two colors.

1270
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:17,700
You have to change the entire board.

1271
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:21,980
And then it happens that you change to one color and if you hop back on it, it changes

1272
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:22,980
back.

1273
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:25,020
And so you have to get them all to match the final new color.

1274
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:27,820
And there's ones that change three times if you hop on them.

1275
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:32,380
And that's where the game just gets, like, disgustingly annoying.

1276
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:33,860
I was really good at this.

1277
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:39,840
I had the, actually, I had the Coleco version, Coleco Vision version for a long time, which

1278
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:40,840
I still have.

1279
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,700
I had the Commodore 64 version.

1280
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:49,580
Um, but your little enemies are called Coily, who's the purple snake, and Ugg and Wrongway,

1281
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:55,580
these little purple snotty little creatures, and Slick and Sam that are the green boogers.

1282
01:02:55,580 --> 01:03:02,420
And you can, you know, ride the little discs up to the top of the pyramid.

1283
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:07,540
And if you jump on the pyramid right, on the disc right when one of the enemies are chasing

1284
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:12,620
you, or I should say Coily is chasing you, they'll hop off the edge behind you and die.

1285
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:14,940
Isn't that great, Rob?

1286
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:15,940
Yes.

1287
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:17,580
That used to be how you'd have to do it.

1288
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:22,460
You'd have to kind of, like, lure them towards the disc and then kind of jump up there.

1289
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:25,380
It's kind of like what you were talking about last week during the Classic Game of the Week,

1290
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:27,580
which was Link to the Past.

1291
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:30,940
How you'd have in those dungeons, the guards would charge at you, and if you were standing

1292
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:34,260
towards the edge, then you'd just run real fast and they'd charge right off the edge

1293
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:35,260
into oblivion.

1294
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:36,260
It was great.

1295
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:41,980
Well, um, the other thing about this too, though, is that it was, um, produced by Gottlieb,

1296
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:48,380
who does a lot of, who did, I should say, a lot of, uh, pinball tables too.

1297
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:58,660
Um, it also, um, the guy who developed it, uh, Warren Davis, sorry, um, was, uh, the

1298
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:05,940
guy who was behind, um, Revolution X and Terminator 2 and a lot of fun, Joust 2 and Us vs. Them,

1299
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:07,820
which is a laserdisc game.

1300
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:13,380
So he's been in, he was also on an episode of House MD, I didn't know that.

1301
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:18,500
Anyway, he's, you know, been around, you know, in the industry for a while and brought out

1302
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:20,220
some pretty big classics.

1303
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:26,740
And then, um, it really is just a very simple little game, but it gets really hard.

1304
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:32,420
Um, as far as, uh, there were other games that came out.

1305
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:38,340
Um, for Qbert itself, it came out on the Odyssey 2, which I have that system as well.

1306
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:47,180
The Texas Instruments TI99, the, uh, Commodore VIC-20, um, Atari, the Atari systems, um,

1307
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:49,860
the Atari 5200 version is ass, by the way.

1308
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:51,860
Qbert was on everything from the 80s.

1309
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:52,860
Yeah.

1310
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:53,860
Everything.

1311
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:54,860
Pretty much.

1312
01:04:54,860 --> 01:05:01,020
Um, there was also, um, a sequel, an actual sequel called Qbert's Cubes, which, um...

1313
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:02,020
Is not bad.

1314
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:03,020
I played it.

1315
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:04,020
It's kind of fun.

1316
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:05,020
Yeah, it's kind of fun.

1317
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:08,500
Um, then there was Qbert III that came out on the NES, but it was very much like the

1318
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:09,500
first one.

1319
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:14,340
And there was a Qbert pinball, of course, got, like, put out called Qbert's Quest.

1320
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:22,820
And, um, there was a tabletop electronic game version, um, all kinds of stuff.

1321
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:32,060
There's also, um, a version that, uh, was put out by Davis that, um, was called Faster,

1322
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:37,300
Harder, More Challenging Qbert, and it's actually now out, um, while he didn't put it into production,

1323
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:38,300
is out for MAME.

1324
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:39,940
He released the, uh, ROM image.

1325
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:40,940
Oh, wow.

1326
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:41,940
Cool.

1327
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:46,940
And, of course, there's, um, the, uh, updated Qbert that, um, uh, was on, um...

1328
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:54,340
Crap, now I can't remember which of the, um, but it was, uh, um, a 3D Qbert, like a Qbert

1329
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:55,340
remix or something.

1330
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:57,900
I think there was one on PlayStation, I want to say.

1331
01:05:57,900 --> 01:05:58,900
I could be wrong.

1332
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:04,300
Yeah, there was, uh, the one on PS3, there was the 3D version of it, and it was supposed

1333
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:05,300
to be pretty good.

1334
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:06,300
Hmm.

1335
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:11,020
You know, I liked Qbert and all, and I, I, I would like to see this come out on the Game

1336
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:15,580
Room that Microsoft is doing, but I don't know if, if it will, because who owns the

1337
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:17,660
rights to the Gottlieb games now?

1338
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:20,620
Like, don't, doesn't a board game company own that, like, it doesn't, like, Hasbro

1339
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:21,620
own them or something?

1340
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:22,980
Is something really weird?

1341
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:25,140
I don't know, but I'm wondering where this...

1342
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:31,660
Like, I would think, though, free money, you know, like, hello, why don't you, uh, put

1343
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:35,020
this game out on Game Room, but I don't know, it's gonna be weird.

1344
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:39,440
But I do hope if it does come out on Game Room, that you can control it with the buttons,

1345
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,300
because you know with the D-pad it's gonna stink.

1346
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:47,100
In fact, on the Commodore 64 version, there was a mode where you could tilt your joystick

1347
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:52,740
45 degrees, so that way you used up, down, left, and right to control.

1348
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:57,540
And then up went, like, actually to the upright, and you know, it, it, it, it made it a lot

1349
01:06:57,540 --> 01:07:02,180
easier to control on the Commodore 64, trust me, because trying to hit diag-diagonal directions,

1350
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:05,740
can you imagine trying to hit diagonal directions on the Xbox 360 D-pad?

1351
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:07,340
No thank you.

1352
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:10,540
Hopefully if it does come out in Game Room, you can use buttons for precision.

1353
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:11,540
Hopefully.

1354
01:07:11,540 --> 01:07:12,540
We'll see.

1355
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:13,540
But yeah.

1356
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:14,540
Oh, you know what else I remember, Rob?

1357
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:15,540
What's that?

1358
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:17,540
The Qbert cartoon, when I was a kid.

1359
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:18,540
Mm-hmm.

1360
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:19,540
I had the Qbert board game.

1361
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:20,540
There was a board game.

1362
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:21,540
Yep.

1363
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:25,940
I actually, somewhere, I had, I may not still have it, but I had a Qbert plushie.

1364
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:26,940
Very cute.

1365
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:27,940
With his big nose.

1366
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:32,060
All right, well that's gonna bring us to a close of part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but

1367
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:33,060
we are not done yet.

1368
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:35,140
We still have part B coming up after the break.

1369
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:39,500
We're gonna talk about a new console from Sega, but it's not what you think.

1370
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:44,300
We're gonna talk about a sequel to the Fallout series and some interesting developments over

1371
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:45,300
at Harmonix.

1372
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:48,580
That's all coming up in part B. So those of you listening live, stay tuned.

1373
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:51,380
We'll be back in a few minutes with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1374
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:53,260
Podcast listeners, you only have to wait a few seconds.

1375
01:07:53,260 --> 01:08:02,980
So we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1376
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:08,020
Welcome back, everybody, to more of Orange Lounge Radio on this part B of our podcast

1377
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:14,220
episode number 354 for this February the 7th of 2010.

1378
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:19,140
It is Super Bowl Sunday here in the States, and I'm kind of, I don't really watch the

1379
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:20,140
game.

1380
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:21,140
I'm not really into football.

1381
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:22,140
The Super Bowl.

1382
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:24,660
But I know a lot of people watch it, so I know it was keeping people away from the show.

1383
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:26,660
But now that it's over, you have no excuse.

1384
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:31,020
So hopefully, if you're listening live, you are here in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

1385
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:35,260
And of course, if you're listening to us on the podcast feed, you should try and make

1386
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:36,980
it for a live show sometime.

1387
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:38,580
We will be here next Sunday.

1388
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:43,120
Next Sunday is Valentine's Day, which is also probably going to keep several people away.

1389
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:46,840
But the three of us have arranged plans with our significant others, so we will still be

1390
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:49,260
able to be here for the Valentine's Day show.

1391
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:51,180
So look forward to that.

1392
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:53,940
Anyhow, or as some folks like to call it, Singles Awareness Day.

1393
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:56,500
So if you're single, come join the OLR family.

1394
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:58,660
We'll make you feel right at home here and talk about games or something.

1395
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:02,300
Keep your mind off of what Hallmark wants you to think about all day long.

1396
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:03,300
All right.

1397
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:05,900
Anyhow, let's get back into some gaming news, huh?

1398
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:06,900
Yes.

1399
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:07,900
All right.

1400
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:09,620
Let's do some quick, quick news stories.

1401
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:10,620
Loki.

1402
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:11,620
Yes.

1403
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:12,620
This is kind of cool.

1404
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:17,660
Now, there will be a Heavy Rain demo coming out on PlayStation 3 soon.

1405
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:19,860
It's not scheduled to come out until February 11th.

1406
01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:23,680
But if you can't wait that long, you can actually download it now.

1407
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:27,700
And the way you do this is participate in their alternate reality game.

1408
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:30,260
Now I know you probably don't have the time to do all that stuff.

1409
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:34,640
Thankfully if you go to Kotaku.com, they actually have a guide to walk you through picking up

1410
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:41,340
the four pieces of evidence that you need to pick out in order to receive this demo.

1411
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:45,980
So the clue and everything is all right there for you.

1412
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:52,480
Basically it just involves you signing up on Sony's site, heavyrainps3.com, and just

1413
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:53,600
register there.

1414
01:09:53,600 --> 01:10:00,900
And then go to the website precinct52.com.

1415
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:07,060
And then you can just look for the four pieces of evidence, which are the short cigarette

1416
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:17,220
marked 11117B, the Origami Bird, Coffee Shop C, which you'll actually click on the one

1417
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:23,760
that says Diner on it, and then the tire tracks, it's 117H.

1418
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,780
When you click on the tire tracks, it actually expands it out.

1419
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:26,780
Same with the cigarettes.

1420
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:30,700
You click on the picture of the cigarette and it'll be two different choices and choose

1421
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:31,700
117B.

1422
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:36,820
Once you've done all that, you'll receive a code to download the demo immediately, which

1423
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:41,140
is better than waiting till the 11th.

1424
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:42,140
Other fun stuff.

1425
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:46,700
Coming to the PlayStation Network, Fret Nice, which was a game, it's kind of a side scroll

1426
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:52,340
platformer game, that was actually a Flash game at one time that you played entirely

1427
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:55,720
with the Guitar Hero Rock Band controller.

1428
01:10:55,720 --> 01:11:01,140
Although for whatever reason, they decided to go with this really freakishly weird art

1429
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:02,140
style.

1430
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:04,220
Personally, I like the Flash version better.

1431
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:09,140
But whatever, it will be available on PlayStation Network soon.

1432
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:15,780
And no date yet on the Xbox Live Arcade version, but soon.

1433
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:18,420
So PlayStation 3 is sweet though.

1434
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:25,340
And then finally, Rock Band is getting some new download content, including, well tonight

1435
01:11:25,340 --> 01:11:38,380
actually was the Who Super Bowl Smash Up Medley, and that was available for $2 or $2 in whatever

1436
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:41,020
respective points you're spending.

1437
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:50,220
Also this week will be another album as well, including Holy Wars, The Punishment Due, which

1438
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:53,780
is for also $2.

1439
01:11:53,780 --> 01:12:03,780
Hangar 18, Take No Prisoners, Five Magics, Poison Was the Cure, Lucretia, Tornado of

1440
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:07,940
Souls, Dawn Patrol, and Rust in Peace Polaris.

1441
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:12,780
All those are available for $2 as well.

1442
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:16,900
And that's of course off the Mega Death Hangar 18 album I believe.

1443
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:19,620
Or no, Rust in Peace, my mistake.

1444
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:23,620
Okay, well I've got some more news for you guys for some other types of games.

1445
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:26,900
Not music based, but definitely a popular game folks are looking forward to.

1446
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:28,620
ModNation Racers.

1447
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:30,660
As you know, this game is coming out on the PlayStation 3.

1448
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:32,660
Do we have a time frame when that game's coming out?

1449
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:33,660
Is that summer?

1450
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:36,220
It got delayed again, so June as of right now.

1451
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:39,420
Well apparently, not only is there going to be a PlayStation 3 version, there's going

1452
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:41,460
to be a PSP version launching out.

1453
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:42,460
What?!

1454
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:44,100
I know, I've never heard this news before.

1455
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:45,560
Totally new news!

1456
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:49,020
But anyway, just so you know, this game does have all the same tools that you'll find in

1457
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:52,220
the PS3 version, but of course the graphics are going to be scaled down a little bit.

1458
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:57,900
But you still get to make your own cars, your own racers, your own tracks, and you get to

1459
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:00,980
share them with the PSP ModNation community.

1460
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:04,260
You get to go online with it and race and all that fun stuff.

1461
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:10,400
So PS3 and PSP versions launching side by side, very similar to LittleBigPlanet of course

1462
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:15,340
also has the PS3 and PSP versions, but there was about a year break between the two.

1463
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:19,220
Don't expect to see that same large window between these two releases.

1464
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:20,940
Again, totally new news to me.

1465
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:22,660
I haven't heard this anywhere before.

1466
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:28,060
Hey, Civ Network is a popular anticipated Facebook game, at least at my house.

1467
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:32,900
I'm really excited to play Civilization Network, but not going to get a chance to tell June.

1468
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:36,780
Yeah that's when the Civilization Network beta is apparently happening, is June.

1469
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:41,460
So yeah, Variety of all places is the one that made this report.

1470
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:44,620
Yeah Variety, the magazine usually talks about movies and TV, well they have to talk about

1471
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:46,820
games too when there's big stuff going on.

1472
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:51,820
The beta for the new Facebook game, according to Variety, not starting until June.

1473
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:54,980
By the way, this game was initially announced back in October, and that they were going

1474
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:58,220
to do a beta tester hunt soon.

1475
01:13:58,220 --> 01:14:01,980
So soon means nine months.

1476
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:06,860
So yeah, it's like saying, you know, I'm going to have a baby soon.

1477
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:10,300
One other thing I got for you guys this week, a game lots and lots of people are talking

1478
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:14,460
about, Mass Effect 2, is obviously a hugely popular title this week, and with good reason

1479
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:18,820
from what I understand, I haven't played it myself, but I hear it's pretty fucking epic.

1480
01:14:18,820 --> 01:14:22,900
One thing though that is not epic is the size of the text, and if you're playing on a standard

1481
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:25,780
television, you probably can't read it.

1482
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:27,420
It's got the tiny text problem.

1483
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:30,940
You know, you've heard about this in other games before, it's not just Mass Effect 2

1484
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:31,940
that's had this problem.

1485
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:34,500
I want to say The Lost Planet had this, some other games too.

1486
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:39,660
And usually companies patch this problem so that you can actually read these on an SDTV.

1487
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:45,700
Well guess what, according to the project manager Michael Gamble, let's see, quote,

1488
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:50,020
we understand that on some SDTVs, the smallest text in Mass Effect 2 can be difficult to

1489
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:51,020
read.

1490
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:54,060
While this was not an intentional result, it was a byproduct of the enhancements to

1491
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:55,460
the user interface.

1492
01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:59,180
After investigating potential solutions, we have determined that while this issue does

1493
01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:03,980
affect a small portion of SDTV owners, we are unable to resolve it for Mass Effect 2

1494
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:05,300
through a title update.

1495
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:09,940
So if you can't read the text on a small TV, it's time to buy a big TV.

1496
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:10,940
Dr. Zara.

1497
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:15,140
Well if you don't have a big TV, you should just get one anyway regardless.

1498
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:25,300
Well the PSP Go is apparently getting a relaunch, even though the PSP Go is kind of crap anyway.

1499
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:30,060
But Gamervision is saying that they're definitely going to have a relaunch and that there's

1500
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:31,060
going to be a price drop.

1501
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:33,540
So maybe that'll work, who knows?

1502
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:36,500
I still think it's crap.

1503
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:47,300
Also, for our DDR fans, DDR Universe 3, DDS Revolution Universe 3 is on Xbox 360 games

1504
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:48,300
on demand.

1505
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:51,680
So, get your $30 dollars ready if you want it.

1506
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:56,500
Or save your money, because it was my least favorite of the Xbox 360 games.

1507
01:15:56,500 --> 01:16:01,340
And yeah, this is the thing that I actually bought a thousand cryptic points for.

1508
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:07,420
Is that you can play a Ferengi or a Federation Klingon in Star Trek Online.

1509
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:11,260
But it's like, you have to pay so much.

1510
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:12,460
Okay, get this.

1511
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:17,900
You pay 240 cryptic points for a Klingon, right?

1512
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:21,300
You pay 80 for a Ferengi.

1513
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:22,300
80.

1514
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:24,380
What are they saying?

1515
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:25,860
That maybe they just suck?

1516
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:29,580
They should also have a character trait called greed, I think.

1517
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:33,980
Isn't that a little weird though, that you bought this game, yet they're making you pay

1518
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:39,020
extra to roll these classes that probably a lot of people want to do?

1519
01:16:39,020 --> 01:16:40,980
No.

1520
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:46,060
I suppose WoW charges you for certain types of faction changes and so forth, but I can't

1521
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:50,400
think of anything that's locked out without having to spend more money, except I suppose

1522
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:52,620
actual expansion packs themselves, I don't know.

1523
01:16:52,620 --> 01:16:56,240
Well, the one thing that I want them to do is to make some of the pre-order special stuff

1524
01:16:56,240 --> 01:17:01,660
available for other people.

1525
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:04,660
And also for some reason, my liberated Borg isn't showing up.

1526
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:08,060
I haven't tried looking in the thing again, but I haven't been able to make a liberated

1527
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:09,060
Borg for my bridge crew.

1528
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:10,060
Uh oh.

1529
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:12,940
Maybe soon I need to find out where that is.

1530
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:16,180
But I mean, I'm just saying that the other thing too is that I bought more points so

1531
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:19,220
I could buy a third character slot.

1532
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:20,460
Are you only allowed two character slots?

1533
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:21,460
Two character slots.

1534
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:23,620
Are there multiple servers or is it just one giant server?

1535
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:24,620
One big giant server.

1536
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:25,620
Oh wow, that's kind of cool.

1537
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:30,660
The other thing is they were having, if you buy a lifetime membership, then you can have,

1538
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:34,620
you start off with four slots, and you have the year when you get like one more extra

1539
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:35,620
slot, I think.

1540
01:17:35,620 --> 01:17:36,620
So I don't know.

1541
01:17:36,620 --> 01:17:40,380
I didn't, I don't have the money for a lifetime, although I'd pay for it.

1542
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:43,820
Question from our chat room, from Amaze Satsuma, chat.orangelaunchradio.com, do the female

1543
01:17:43,820 --> 01:17:45,220
Ferengi wear clothes?

1544
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:49,460
Yes, they do, and there's an explanation for that, because keep in mind, all of our DS9

1545
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:55,020
buddies out there, Rom's the Grand Nagus, and he brought in social reform.

1546
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:58,540
Let's go to Twitter topics.

1547
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:00,780
Every week we invite you guys to send us your tweets.

1548
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:05,940
Show us your tweets at username O-L-R and submit your topics for possible consideration

1549
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:06,940
to be read on the show.

1550
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:09,180
There's a few of them tonight, so I don't think we're going to read all of these, but

1551
01:18:09,180 --> 01:18:10,500
I'll read a few of these.

1552
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:18,260
From Pod Culture, Twitter topic, collector's editions of video games, yay or nay?

1553
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:20,820
I say yay depending on what you're into.

1554
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:22,980
Some of the extras can be cool sometimes.

1555
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:28,320
It gets a little weird though when there's like really game changing items that are only

1556
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,220
available in the collector's edition.

1557
01:18:30,220 --> 01:18:33,060
I don't know, that's not cool to me.

1558
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:36,060
But I mean if it's a game I really like, sure I'm going to get the collector's edition.

1559
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:39,900
Like if there's a Final Fantasy 13 collector's edition, I'm probably buying it.

1560
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:41,940
Logie, collector's editions, yay nay?

1561
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:44,060
It all depends what's in it and how much it's for.

1562
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:47,900
I don't even have to ask Jamie, she's thumbing through her Star Trek collector's edition

1563
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:48,900
right now.

1564
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:52,280
It came with an art book, it was cool, and a pen, and I get like all kinds of cool stuff

1565
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:53,280
with it.

1566
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:58,100
So if it's something that I really like, if there's something that I really, really like,

1567
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:03,820
and you know me and I love stuff, I will get the collector's edition.

1568
01:19:03,820 --> 01:19:08,300
Going through some other tweets here, Alex Carson, interesting question.

1569
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:11,300
I don't know if we're going to have much of an answer to this on Twitter.

1570
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:14,940
What podcast do you guys like to tune into?

1571
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:17,140
Please tell me one of you guys like Stignation.

1572
01:19:17,140 --> 01:19:20,380
Here's the thing, and I don't know if Logie and Jamie feel similarly, but I don't listen

1573
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:24,340
to a lot of other podcasts because I don't want to be inadvertently influenced by what

1574
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:25,900
I hear on other shows.

1575
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:27,300
Like I'm all for you guys.

1576
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:28,820
How John Tesh of you?

1577
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:32,540
Well I'm all for you guys listening to independent shows and I think you should support other

1578
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:37,720
independent radio, but I don't want to like hear something on one show and then like inadvertently

1579
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:39,220
without knowing, copy it.

1580
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:40,220
Does that make sense?

1581
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:41,220
Yeah.

1582
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:42,940
But I do support folks listening to other shows.

1583
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:43,940
There are a few.

1584
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:44,940
I've listened to more.

1585
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:48,140
I drive to the Bay Area more often now because you know I date somebody that lives in the

1586
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:49,620
Bay Area and it's about a two hour drive.

1587
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:52,340
I have used podcasts to fill the gap.

1588
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:54,860
Let me check with Dark Soccer and Logie though first before I answer.

1589
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:56,900
I do have a couple podcasts I like.

1590
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:58,380
Dark Soccer, Logie, anything?

1591
01:19:58,380 --> 01:20:05,880
I was listening to the Grammarcast for a while and there are a couple more like a few classic

1592
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:12,620
gaming ones that I was listening to, but for the most part I actually don't really have

1593
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:13,620
time.

1594
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:17,740
I should set them up to download on my iPhone, but I hardly ever forget to update my iPhone

1595
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:18,740
anyway.

1596
01:20:18,740 --> 01:20:19,740
Logie?

1597
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:21,660
I don't really listen to other podcasts.

1598
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:24,420
You can't at your work either because you're on the phone and stuff, right?

1599
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:29,300
So I know a lot of people listen to some work to pass the time.

1600
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:36,820
No, it's not, I just don't because, I don't know, I just don't.

1601
01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:44,340
I don't have time, well I probably have time during the day, but I just don't want to.

1602
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:47,620
Not that I don't think there's good stuff out there, it's just I don't listen to radio

1603
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:48,620
either.

1604
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:54,860
I listen to my CD player, or I guess MP3 player right now that has like ten songs on it and

1605
01:20:54,860 --> 01:20:58,940
I loop them and I just don't care about adding new stuff to it.

1606
01:20:58,940 --> 01:21:07,100
So same thing with podcasts, I read the news, there's no, for me I'd probably listen to

1607
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:12,080
the game podcasts and I read the news and stuff, so I don't really need to hear the

1608
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,080
news again.

1609
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:20,020
Wait a minute, you just told people to basically not listen to this show.

1610
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:21,020
So be it, whatever.

1611
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:23,540
I'm just telling you why I don't listen to it.

1612
01:21:23,540 --> 01:21:28,080
We like to talk about all the news too, not just, I mean we try to report, usually we're

1613
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,460
not the ones breaking the news, but we talk about it.

1614
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:39,140
There's absolutely no news breaking here other than, oh my god, ModNation Racers on PSP.

1615
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:42,540
Let's see, podcasts I listen to, you know, I haven't listened to Dignation, I try to

1616
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:44,780
stay away from some of the corporate ones.

1617
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:48,220
I just think a lot of them aren't that great, although I will say there's an NPR podcast

1618
01:21:48,220 --> 01:21:51,540
that's kind of funny, the Wait Wait Don't Tell Me, it's like the game show-ish one that's

1619
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:52,940
about the weekend news.

1620
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:55,660
It kind of depends on what week it is and who's on the panel, but some of those are

1621
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:56,660
really funny.

1622
01:21:56,660 --> 01:22:01,480
As far as video game podcasts go, I don't know how far I want to say this, like I have

1623
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:05,380
tried listening to a corporate oriented podcast.

1624
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:10,940
It was a very niche thing and I kind of found myself a little bit bored listening to it.

1625
01:22:10,940 --> 01:22:12,660
It was kind of a niche gaming podcast.

1626
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:17,220
I kind of thought the hosts didn't have energy, like they didn't sound excited about what

1627
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:18,220
they were talking about.

1628
01:22:18,220 --> 01:22:22,140
It was kind of like, hello and welcome to our show, we're going to talk about this topic

1629
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:23,140
today.

1630
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:24,820
As hosted by Bob Ross?

1631
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:31,540
Kind of, like I shouldn't say negative things, but I just, a lot of corp podcasts, like dude,

1632
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:32,540
you're even paid to be there.

1633
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:33,540
Well yeah, exactly.

1634
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:34,540
Be excited!

1635
01:22:34,540 --> 01:22:37,860
That and the corporate podcasts too, it's just like, hey, look at all these games that

1636
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:40,420
the game publishers just dumped on our desk with gold and money.

1637
01:22:40,420 --> 01:22:41,980
Look at all this shit I get to play for free!

1638
01:22:41,980 --> 01:22:46,940
They literally shoved money into my pockets and I was just like, oh, I hate this job,

1639
01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:48,220
it's so awful.

1640
01:22:48,220 --> 01:22:52,580
To be fair, I know that gaming journalism is a very tough industry with very few jobs

1641
01:22:52,580 --> 01:22:57,480
and people work their asses off to stay in it, but at the same time, I found myself bored

1642
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:58,660
listening to this particular podcast.

1643
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:02,820
It's just like when we used to go to like Konami press days and stuff like that and

1644
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:07,660
just the people there are, some of them are such douches.

1645
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:10,820
Anyhow, I'm not going to linger on the negative, let me move to the positive because there

1646
01:23:10,820 --> 01:23:13,020
are some indie podcasts I've listened to that I like.

1647
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:16,420
Obviously I like Bobby's show, but clearly I'm biased and Friday Night Gaming I think

1648
01:23:16,420 --> 01:23:17,940
is a great show too.

1649
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:20,980
I actually listened to, and I really like the show, I've listened to it like three times

1650
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:25,820
now on my drives to San Francisco, I like the Warcraft Outsiders.

1651
01:23:25,820 --> 01:23:29,340
It's the spinoff of Video Game Outsiders, which is a show kind of similar to us.

1652
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:34,740
It's a girl and two guys who kind of drink and talk about the video game news, except

1653
01:23:34,740 --> 01:23:35,740
they all do it on Skype.

1654
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:38,300
I think one of them is in Canada and I think the others are on the East Coast somewhere,

1655
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:41,220
but they do like a spinoff show about Warcraft and I think it's pretty good.

1656
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:44,140
The girl leads it and she's like a hardcore Raider healer.

1657
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:47,700
I think her and her boyfriend play a lot and I think they're pretty well informed of what

1658
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:48,700
they're talking about.

1659
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:52,420
I think it has energy.

1660
01:23:52,420 --> 01:23:56,740
They enjoy what they're talking about, although one guy on the show, kind of the running gag

1661
01:23:56,740 --> 01:24:00,900
is that he doesn't really play Warcraft so why is he there, but they make it funny so

1662
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:01,900
it works.

1663
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:07,300
But they have energy, like when she talks about her rating and stuff, you can tell she

1664
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:11,460
is having fun and she's doing a show about something she really likes and the guy too

1665
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:13,340
and the guest host.

1666
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:18,300
For those that want my opinion on what makes a good podcast, have fun on what you're talking

1667
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:19,540
about.

1668
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:23,460
Make people want to listen to you because you are excited and I try to have energy on

1669
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:25,500
the show every week, even if I'm having a shit week.

1670
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:31,980
And don't forget, we've also got the comic podcast too that Mar and Marvel and I do.

1671
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:35,420
And we giggle and are excited!

1672
01:24:35,420 --> 01:24:36,420
So there you go.

1673
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:43,780
Anyhow, let's see, let me move on to other comments on our Twitter.

1674
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:46,260
Spazinator says, latest rumor.

1675
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:52,460
Patrick Stewart is said to be a huge fan of handheld gaming, specifically on the N-Gage.

1676
01:24:52,460 --> 01:24:53,460
Get it?

1677
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:55,260
Oh my god, did I really just read that joke?

1678
01:24:55,260 --> 01:25:00,420
See, let it not be said that we do not let every gamer have a voice, even when we should

1679
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:01,740
probably throw tomatoes at them.

1680
01:25:01,740 --> 01:25:02,740
Waka waka waka.

1681
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:07,180
You know, the bad joke of the week wouldn't be a bad idea, you know, that would be kind

1682
01:25:07,180 --> 01:25:09,180
of funny.

1683
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:12,900
You get the OLR tomato award of the night, Spazinator, congratulations.

1684
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:14,300
Here's one more Twitter question for you guys.

1685
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:18,300
Blue Swim asks us, any word on President Cat coming here?

1686
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:19,300
Nope.

1687
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:23,540
PS Dark Sakura, I can have Mischief Makers as Classic Game of the Week?

1688
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:24,700
Maybe.

1689
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:28,020
As far as President Cat goes, we didn't hear anything after the whole little, you know,

1690
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:31,980
gauntlet of stuff that happened that week.

1691
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:34,700
I don't think it's happening.

1692
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:39,180
You know, there was the negative stories about that it only sold 100 copies, which I still

1693
01:25:39,180 --> 01:25:41,380
say were bullshit.

1694
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:44,120
I failed to see how that was possible.

1695
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:46,020
Maybe 100 copies were imported to the US.

1696
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:49,220
There is no way it sold 100 copies, I'm sorry.

1697
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:56,100
I mean, even the crappiest of absolute shit that comes out on the Wii sells a lot of copies.

1698
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:58,900
That's why they release stuff on the Wii.

1699
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:03,020
It's because people are like, hey, it's a game, it's cheap, let me buy it.

1700
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:09,140
You know, it could be, I don't know, it could be a game about working at a call center or

1701
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:10,140
something.

1702
01:26:10,140 --> 01:26:13,140
Now, the Twitter account Rent a Wii has still been kind of making posts as of late, so they're

1703
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:16,980
still kind of, you know, there, but I don't, I don't know.

1704
01:26:16,980 --> 01:26:20,820
I think at this point, I'm not holding my breath to see it released over here, but you

1705
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:21,820
know, don't give up.

1706
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:26,500
Continue to follow it and send them tweets, and I think the best case scenario at this

1707
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:30,960
point is that someone kind of caught wind of this whole thing going on, and maybe we'll

1708
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:34,340
see a game like President Cat.

1709
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:37,700
But remember, there's a certain charm that President Cat had, and when you make a copy

1710
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:43,180
of a copy, the quality declines, so just be very thoughtful in how you do that if you

1711
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:48,460
are said publisher listening right now, thinking about cashing in on the President Cat craze.

1712
01:26:48,460 --> 01:26:51,140
I think, again, it would sell.

1713
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:52,140
It would.

1714
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:56,340
Let's get back into some long-form gaming news.

1715
01:26:56,340 --> 01:27:00,020
We'll read more of your tweets next week at Twitter.com slash O-L-R. The mailbag's coming

1716
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:01,020
up, though.

1717
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:02,940
I know Dark Soccer's gonna tear into that in just a moment, but we do have some news

1718
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:04,740
before we get there, Loki.

1719
01:27:04,740 --> 01:27:05,740
Yes.

1720
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:11,600
You may remember that there was a, well, there's been a few knockoff Wii systems out there.

1721
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:19,340
One of them was Zone 40, which was just some, like, it looks sort of like a Wii, but not

1722
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:24,460
quite, you know, and it had, you know, 40 little mini games.

1723
01:27:24,460 --> 01:27:31,700
Well, now, they have the officially licensed Sega Zone, which has 20 Genesis Classic games

1724
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:39,840
and 30 new games, 16 of which are playable with the devices, two wireless motion controllers,

1725
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:48,140
and yeah, and it's in the wonderful black and blue with the Sega logo on the side.

1726
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:50,860
Trying to see what games are in there.

1727
01:27:50,860 --> 01:27:52,260
It's kind of hard to see.

1728
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:53,260
Oh, wait, here we go.

1729
01:27:53,260 --> 01:27:54,260
Let me guess.

1730
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:55,260
Sonic the Hedgehog?

1731
01:27:55,260 --> 01:27:56,260
Well, Sonic the Hedgehog, yes.

1732
01:27:56,260 --> 01:27:59,780
I mean, that's, you know, obvious.

1733
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:07,220
Looks like Alex Kidd, Sonic and Knuckles, Columns 3, Eswat, Echo the Dolphin, Golden

1734
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:08,220
Axe.

1735
01:28:08,220 --> 01:28:10,100
Every Sega compilation, basically.

1736
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:16,620
Then, like, some of the other, like, arcade games that they have.

1737
01:28:16,620 --> 01:28:20,780
I think a lot of this is just some generic stuff, like, they have what looks like a boxing

1738
01:28:20,780 --> 01:28:21,780
game.

1739
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:22,780
Looks like Wii boxing or something.

1740
01:28:22,780 --> 01:28:24,140
I can actually see the little picture here.

1741
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:25,660
I got a blown up version of it.

1742
01:28:25,660 --> 01:28:31,900
Eswat, Sonic Spinball, Golden Axe, Shinobi, and then in the Sega games section, they have

1743
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:32,900
Canon.

1744
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:37,220
Well, no, that's the 14 arcade games section right below that.

1745
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:38,780
Mr. Balls is one of them.

1746
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:39,780
Oh, oh, oh, I see.

1747
01:28:39,780 --> 01:28:40,780
I see.

1748
01:28:40,780 --> 01:28:47,060
Bomber, Canon, yeah, I see that's a bottle caps race or something.

1749
01:28:47,060 --> 01:28:52,020
It's like they basically just, you know, copied over some of the, you know, crappy games that

1750
01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:56,020
were on there and put some Sega Genesis games on there.

1751
01:28:56,020 --> 01:28:57,540
And then some interactive sports games.

1752
01:28:57,540 --> 01:28:58,540
Look at that.

1753
01:28:58,540 --> 01:29:03,060
It's like Wii Sports, but with 16 different games, including darts, I see, and, uh, interesting.

1754
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:04,060
Well it would-

1755
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:05,060
Is that curling?

1756
01:29:05,060 --> 01:29:06,060
I believe it is.

1757
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:12,980
It would all depend on what the price is and it says, um, I guess it's priced at, uh, $39.95,

1758
01:29:12,980 --> 01:29:18,300
uh, what is that, euros, I believe, so.

1759
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:19,300
I don't know though.

1760
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:20,300
I mean, it's-

1761
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:21,300
50 pounds.

1762
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:22,300
Cute, but-

1763
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:23,300
50 pounds.

1764
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:24,300
I think I'll pass on that.

1765
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:29,500
Anyhow, um, I don't know how I feel about these games, but, uh, Wheel of Fortune and

1766
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:34,860
Jeopardy, you know, these games, they're actually, I believe they're like Sony Pictures Entertainment,

1767
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:40,660
um, game shows, but THQ has actually licensed the franchises to make video games based on

1768
01:29:40,660 --> 01:29:41,660
them.

1769
01:29:41,660 --> 01:29:44,540
I mean, it's not like it would be the first time ever a video game has been made out of

1770
01:29:44,540 --> 01:29:45,980
Wheel of Fortune or Jeopardy.

1771
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:51,540
But it would be awesome if they were, I don't know, uh, one of the Xbox, you know.

1772
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:53,020
That's what I'm saying.

1773
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:56,340
That's where I was gonna go with this, is that, wouldn't that be cool if they actually,

1774
01:29:56,340 --> 01:30:01,100
I mean, to make these games more fun, did the whole, like, 1 versus 100 route and made

1775
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:03,020
them, like, a little more interactive like that?

1776
01:30:03,020 --> 01:30:09,100
Honestly, 1 versus 100 is awesome and everything, but it's starting to get old, and, um, you

1777
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:12,420
know, I thought there was supposed to be more than just one game on there.

1778
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:18,260
And honestly, I've never played 1 versus 100 on, uh, you know, Xbox Live.

1779
01:30:18,260 --> 01:30:19,260
Just...

1780
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:20,260
It's fun-ish.

1781
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:21,260
Dan likes it.

1782
01:30:21,260 --> 01:30:24,140
I was number one one night on Video Game Trivia, like, halfway through.

1783
01:30:24,140 --> 01:30:28,740
I finally missed, I think I had a 26-question streak, and at one of the breaks, I was, like,

1784
01:30:28,740 --> 01:30:29,740
number one on the leaderboard.

1785
01:30:29,740 --> 01:30:31,300
I took a picture and posted it on Twitter and everything.

1786
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:33,180
I talked about it a few weeks ago on the show.

1787
01:30:33,180 --> 01:30:35,620
Um, but, sadly, yeah, I finally failed.

1788
01:30:35,620 --> 01:30:39,700
I think the question I failed on was, um, oh, I remember it was the ESRB rating.

1789
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:41,660
What was the ESRB rating for Worms 2?

1790
01:30:41,660 --> 01:30:42,660
I got it wrong.

1791
01:30:42,660 --> 01:30:45,060
Um, but anyway, it's, it's fun.

1792
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:47,540
It's, playing the Xbox Live one can be fun.

1793
01:30:47,540 --> 01:30:48,820
But yeah, I get what you're saying, though.

1794
01:30:48,820 --> 01:30:49,820
It does get old.

1795
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:52,460
A lot of these game show things get old, but if there was that variety, I think it could

1796
01:30:52,460 --> 01:30:53,460
be pretty cool.

1797
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:58,740
Especially, like, Jeopardy, Wheel of Fortune, I think these could be cool games to do live.

1798
01:30:58,740 --> 01:31:04,220
Um, you know, with the whole, like, you know, I don't think everybody would just watch three

1799
01:31:04,220 --> 01:31:05,220
players.

1800
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:09,220
But maybe if everybody got, you know how, like, 1 versus 100 splits you up into parties

1801
01:31:09,220 --> 01:31:10,220
of four?

1802
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:11,220
Yeah.

1803
01:31:11,220 --> 01:31:15,140
Maybe if these games did that, it splits you up into random parties of three, and you played

1804
01:31:15,140 --> 01:31:20,260
a predetermined puzzle or predetermined set of questions, and then you can see, maybe,

1805
01:31:20,260 --> 01:31:25,340
at the end, who, out of all the matches, was, like, the top, who got the big, big score.

1806
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:28,100
I mean, there's ways you could do it, I think, and make it fun.

1807
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:31,620
But, sadly, I don't think THQ is going to be doing that, because, guess what?

1808
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:35,700
They're actually going to be releasing them specifically on the Wii and the DS.

1809
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:40,060
So, in other words, get ready to spin the wheel with your Wiimote.

1810
01:31:40,060 --> 01:31:43,380
And they're going to be as bad as successful as The Price is Right and the other games

1811
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:45,900
that came out, which were not very much.

1812
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:48,620
Yeah, I heard Press Your Luck and Price is Right weren't that bad.

1813
01:31:48,620 --> 01:31:53,500
But, anyway, later this year, when those first games are coming out, the statement, by the

1814
01:31:53,500 --> 01:32:00,160
way, about these games came from the THQ kids, family, and casual games executive VP, so

1815
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:03,780
no hardcore wheel of fortune for you.

1816
01:32:03,780 --> 01:32:05,220
I am sorry to say.

1817
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:08,540
I really wish they would go the live game show route, though, on Xbox Live.

1818
01:32:08,540 --> 01:32:10,300
I hope we do get some more of those.

1819
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:11,300
I really do.

1820
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:14,260
Wouldn't it be cool to actually have a live Press Your Luck?

1821
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:15,500
I would love that!

1822
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:16,860
Or a live Price is Right.

1823
01:32:16,860 --> 01:32:17,860
Old school.

1824
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:22,260
I mean, imagine, like, you could be in the audience with your little avatar higher, higher,

1825
01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:23,260
lower.

1826
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:25,980
Do you have a Plinko party?

1827
01:32:25,980 --> 01:32:29,100
There's so much more that can be done, and I hope it is done.

1828
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:33,100
Well, how about something, though, that's good news for a lot of people.

1829
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:40,180
There's Fallout Las- sorry, Fallout New Vegas will be out summer 2010.

1830
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:42,840
There's actually a trailer up and everything.

1831
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:48,060
It's being developed by Obsidian Entertainment, the same people that gave us Knights of the

1832
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:53,380
Old Republic 2, Neverwinter Knights 2, and this is going to be a direct follow-up to

1833
01:32:53,380 --> 01:32:54,380
Fallout 3.

1834
01:32:54,380 --> 01:32:56,380
You look kind of neat.

1835
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:59,180
I just know a lot of people like Fallout.

1836
01:32:59,180 --> 01:33:02,380
Oh yeah, Fallout's a hugely popular game, especially number 3.

1837
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:03,740
It's one of those games I have yet to play.

1838
01:33:03,740 --> 01:33:07,780
It's in my little rental queue, but I haven't gotten the game yet.

1839
01:33:07,780 --> 01:33:11,700
But I hear it's Oblivion with guns, but so much came out, you know, we don't have time

1840
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:15,460
to play every single video game, but I'll try to get around to it, at least before Final

1841
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:20,620
Fantasy XIII comes out, because when that comes out, yeah, I'm not really going to be

1842
01:33:20,620 --> 01:33:23,180
playing anything else for a while.

1843
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:26,180
I know myself.

1844
01:33:26,180 --> 01:33:27,660
So sad.

1845
01:33:27,660 --> 01:33:30,340
All these games.

1846
01:33:30,340 --> 01:33:32,940
So this is kind of interesting.

1847
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:37,100
You may remember back when we talked a little bit about how Walmart and Best Buy were kind

1848
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:42,700
of getting into this kiosk trade-in type of business.

1849
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:48,180
They're going to be able to buy, sell, trade games, also rent out games, and I believe

1850
01:33:48,180 --> 01:33:50,900
DVDs as well.

1851
01:33:50,900 --> 01:33:58,460
Problem is, though, the company behind it, ePlay, has ceased operations.

1852
01:33:58,460 --> 01:34:04,860
So I don't know if that means closing or out of business or whatever, but they're no longer

1853
01:34:04,860 --> 01:34:09,020
operating, if you will.

1854
01:34:09,020 --> 01:34:14,340
So unfortunately that will probably go away, which is too bad, because I hear that their

1855
01:34:14,340 --> 01:34:17,580
trade-in values are pretty good.

1856
01:34:17,580 --> 01:34:22,100
Not true, though, if you're doing that in Canada, because I believe actually in Canada

1857
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:26,700
Best Buy actually handles their trade-ins in the store and not through a kiosk, so that's

1858
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:28,700
kind of cool.

1859
01:34:28,700 --> 01:34:40,100
Also GameCrazy, apparently the parent company movie gallery has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy

1860
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:47,660
again, and they're only basically going to drop it down to only 250 GameCrazy locations

1861
01:34:47,660 --> 01:34:54,240
once they're done and be liquidating close to 760 stores.

1862
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:55,660
I can vouch for that.

1863
01:34:55,660 --> 01:34:59,060
That's a lot of depressing news in the retail world.

1864
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:00,060
Yeah.

1865
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:01,060
That's something that hits home here.

1866
01:35:01,060 --> 01:35:02,060
Oh, sure, I'm sure.

1867
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:04,500
Do you know yet if everything's going to be okay?

1868
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:07,540
We're thinking that the Cameron Park store is going to be okay.

1869
01:35:07,540 --> 01:35:08,540
That's cool.

1870
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:09,540
All right.

1871
01:35:09,540 --> 01:35:10,540
Well, good luck.

1872
01:35:10,540 --> 01:35:11,540
I hope everything turns out all right.

1873
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:12,540
Me too.

1874
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:13,540
You know, I like living in a house.

1875
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:14,540
Yeah.

1876
01:35:14,540 --> 01:35:15,700
Anyhow, on to happier news.

1877
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:20,660
Some of the comments in chat still talking about the whole ideas of game shows on Xbox

1878
01:35:20,660 --> 01:35:25,660
Live, and I think SSJ 100 Matt totally has the winner idea of what games should be on

1879
01:35:25,660 --> 01:35:26,860
Xbox Live.

1880
01:35:26,860 --> 01:35:29,860
You ready?

1881
01:35:29,860 --> 01:35:38,280
Ah, yes, the match game.

1882
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:41,580
If only they could find a way to bring back Brett Summers and Charles Nelson Riley from

1883
01:35:41,580 --> 01:35:42,580
the dead.

1884
01:35:42,580 --> 01:35:44,580
It'd be amazing.

1885
01:35:44,580 --> 01:35:45,740
Kind of a sad face news.

1886
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:47,340
You know I'm big on live journal, right?

1887
01:35:47,340 --> 01:35:52,100
One of my good friends that I've had on live journal for years now ran a community on live

1888
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:56,860
journal called Match Game LJ, which, you know, kind of did like a little live journal version

1889
01:35:56,860 --> 01:35:57,860
of the match game every week.

1890
01:35:57,860 --> 01:36:01,460
He decided to close it down this week, and he's not going to be running it anymore.

1891
01:36:01,460 --> 01:36:03,220
Give me sad face.

1892
01:36:03,220 --> 01:36:06,800
So what up, Mark, if you're listening, although I doubt he is, but yes, match game should

1893
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:07,800
be on Xbox Live.

1894
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:08,800
That would be wonderful.

1895
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:10,800
I would love that.

1896
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:11,800
All right.

1897
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:12,860
On to some other news.

1898
01:36:12,860 --> 01:36:16,900
This is definitely kind of an eyebrow raising piece here from Harmonics.

1899
01:36:16,900 --> 01:36:21,460
Harmonics has apparently done some more licensing, and this really isn't a big surprise when

1900
01:36:21,460 --> 01:36:25,140
you consider, oh yeah, duh, Harmonics makes music games, and you know, they license stuff

1901
01:36:25,140 --> 01:36:27,300
for Rock Band 2 all of the time.

1902
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:30,900
But look at some of the things they've been licensing lately.

1903
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:32,460
This is all from the Royalty Network.

1904
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:34,620
I guess some people were watching there.

1905
01:36:34,620 --> 01:36:42,900
Anti Up by M.O.P., Say Ah by Trey Songs, Evacuate the Dance Floor by Cascada, The Way I Are

1906
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:45,780
by Timbaland featuring DOE.

1907
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:48,700
Those are all like dancy, poppy songs.

1908
01:36:48,700 --> 01:36:51,140
They don't belong in Rock Band.

1909
01:36:51,140 --> 01:36:52,340
Or do they?

1910
01:36:52,340 --> 01:36:55,900
Or what is going on at Camp Harmonics?

1911
01:36:55,900 --> 01:36:57,120
Hmm.

1912
01:36:57,120 --> 01:37:00,660
Could it be that Harmo- now there's a couple options here.

1913
01:37:00,660 --> 01:37:04,940
Harmonics could be looking at going a really radically different direction with Rock Band

1914
01:37:04,940 --> 01:37:07,740
3, perhaps.

1915
01:37:07,740 --> 01:37:12,340
It could be that they have a DJ, other type of like DJ Hero-ish game in the works, some

1916
01:37:12,340 --> 01:37:14,140
answer to that.

1917
01:37:14,140 --> 01:37:20,540
It could be that they have a DDR response in the works, a dance game, maybe a pop band

1918
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:21,540
type of game.

1919
01:37:21,540 --> 01:37:22,540
Who knows?

1920
01:37:22,540 --> 01:37:23,540
Dancing.

1921
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:24,540
Who knows?

1922
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:25,540
What do you think?

1923
01:37:25,540 --> 01:37:26,540
Or just a karaoke game.

1924
01:37:26,540 --> 01:37:28,060
A karaoke game?

1925
01:37:28,060 --> 01:37:32,100
Although Harmonics did the original Karaoke Revolution, I mean I couldn't see Harmonics

1926
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:35,500
doing just a karaoke game when there's so many on the market now and they're already

1927
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:36,500
into Rock Band.

1928
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:37,500
I don't know.

1929
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:39,340
I've got to admit, you know what I'm tempted to say?

1930
01:37:39,340 --> 01:37:43,140
I just- my gut tells me it's a dance game.

1931
01:37:43,140 --> 01:37:47,700
That they're going to try to take the dance game crown from Konami and now's a pretty

1932
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:50,580
good time, honestly.

1933
01:37:50,580 --> 01:37:53,260
They could do it.

1934
01:37:53,260 --> 01:37:54,900
I don't know, what do you guys think?

1935
01:37:54,900 --> 01:38:00,100
Obviously this is a topic that hits home here at OLR.

1936
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:01,980
This show started over DDR.

1937
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:07,660
The dance genre is really that popular anymore, I mean, I guess you've seen a couple titles

1938
01:38:07,660 --> 01:38:12,060
that are really kind of stand out now, but they're a little bit different than DDR, like

1939
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:16,660
Just Dance is a title that I'm surprised is doing okay.

1940
01:38:16,660 --> 01:38:21,260
Actually, I have some co-workers, and I always talk about co-workers because that's my way

1941
01:38:21,260 --> 01:38:23,580
to gauge the casual gamer.

1942
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:27,540
Do some of my co-workers that I would not imagine played a lot of Nintendo Wii love

1943
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:30,100
Just Dance, and think it's like, great.

1944
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:33,700
And I've heard some people on the show talking highly about it too, some of our chatters

1945
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:34,700
and stuff.

1946
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:39,280
Apparently it's this big cult music game that's doing very well, culty type.

1947
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,860
I gotta play it at some point.

1948
01:38:41,860 --> 01:38:44,060
But anyway, sorry, what was the rest of your thought there?

1949
01:38:44,060 --> 01:38:47,500
No, I'm just surprised that, you know, that's doing well.

1950
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:54,620
So I'm not sure if they would be going, like, that route though.

1951
01:38:54,620 --> 01:38:58,860
Frisbee in our chatroom says Konami doesn't have the crown, StepMania does.

1952
01:38:58,860 --> 01:39:03,900
I'm just gonna say this and rip it off like a bandaid here and just kind of give you my

1953
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:04,900
thought here.

1954
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:07,420
StepMania is not legitimate.

1955
01:39:07,420 --> 01:39:10,780
I know that probably sucks to hear, and I know it's got a big community and everything,

1956
01:39:10,780 --> 01:39:12,660
but it's not legitimate.

1957
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:13,660
Neither is In the Groove.

1958
01:39:13,660 --> 01:39:17,340
Do you, well, In the Groove is a step above StepMania.

1959
01:39:17,340 --> 01:39:21,100
In the Groove was the way to try and legitimize StepMania, but let me put it this way.

1960
01:39:21,100 --> 01:39:24,740
You do not walk into a GameStop and buy StepMania over the counter.

1961
01:39:24,740 --> 01:39:26,060
Or do you really buy StepMania at all?

1962
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:28,180
I mean, it's just not, it's not the same.

1963
01:39:28,180 --> 01:39:31,040
StepMania was always there to emulate DDR.

1964
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:33,960
And then yeah, they tried to kind of innovate it later, especially within the Groove and

1965
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:39,400
so forth, but it's not, I mean, I could see Harmonix doing what Konami should have done

1966
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:45,260
about six years ago and reinventing DDR from the ground up, which supposedly is also happening

1967
01:39:45,260 --> 01:39:46,620
by Konami right now.

1968
01:39:46,620 --> 01:39:50,420
I haven't heard what's up with that DDR game they're supposed to be putting out with eight

1969
01:39:50,420 --> 01:39:51,420
panels.

1970
01:39:51,420 --> 01:39:52,420
Like, wasn't that supposed to be out last Christmas?

1971
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:53,420
It got delayed.

1972
01:39:53,420 --> 01:39:54,420
Uh, yeah.

1973
01:39:54,420 --> 01:40:01,180
It was supposed to be actually out this spring, and it still hasn't been released yet.

1974
01:40:01,180 --> 01:40:07,820
I think probably the second quarter, but even still, it's just, I can't get excited about

1975
01:40:07,820 --> 01:40:08,820
it.

1976
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:15,060
I go to DDRfreak.com and let's see, do I see anything about the new DDR game?

1977
01:40:15,060 --> 01:40:22,300
Let's see, DDRfreak, Pump It Up Pro 2, StepMania, the manga, DJ Hero Deal, Cobalt Flux, back

1978
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:25,900
in November, $40 Amazon credit with various hero bundles.

1979
01:40:25,900 --> 01:40:26,900
Yeah.

1980
01:40:26,900 --> 01:40:28,680
There's no news on DDR and even DDRfreak.

1981
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:33,540
I mean, that is a sign about how Konami has fumbled and dropped the DDR crown.

1982
01:40:33,540 --> 01:40:38,860
I think if Harmonix were to show up at E3 with a new dance game, with not, I hate to

1983
01:40:38,860 --> 01:40:41,860
say it guys, I know I'm going to piss some of you off with this comment, but without

1984
01:40:41,860 --> 01:40:45,620
the J-pop and the stuff that most people on this side of the ocean don't know, but stuff

1985
01:40:45,620 --> 01:40:50,860
like Timberland and Cascada and people actually recognize from clubs, uh, Harmonix is going

1986
01:40:50,860 --> 01:40:57,860
to, they're going to do to DDR what they did to Guitar Hero, or Guitar Freaks, sorry, with

1987
01:40:57,860 --> 01:40:58,860
Guitar Hero.

1988
01:40:58,860 --> 01:41:00,140
That could be what we're looking at.

1989
01:41:00,140 --> 01:41:02,140
Well, we'll just have to wait and see.

1990
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:05,660
And it could be not, it could be that Rock Band 3, I mean, again, this is all speculation.

1991
01:41:05,660 --> 01:41:10,860
I don't know why my gut just tells me Konami is vulnerable right now.

1992
01:41:10,860 --> 01:41:14,780
If DDRfreak can't even tell you the latest and what's going on with eight panel DDR and

1993
01:41:14,780 --> 01:41:19,260
this whole reinvention of the franchise, I mean, hello, something is wrong.

1994
01:41:19,260 --> 01:41:20,260
Right?

1995
01:41:20,260 --> 01:41:21,260
Yeah.

1996
01:41:21,260 --> 01:41:25,460
You know, we technically do have eight panel DDR, Rob.

1997
01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:26,460
Doubles.

1998
01:41:26,460 --> 01:41:27,460
You know what I'm talking about.

1999
01:41:27,460 --> 01:41:28,460
I know.

2000
01:41:28,460 --> 01:41:29,460
I know.

2001
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:30,460
Well, just like quad mode.

2002
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:31,860
How did that ever catch on?

2003
01:41:31,860 --> 01:41:32,860
I don't know.

2004
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:36,580
Dark Tetsuya is saying, so Rob, are you saying DDR is dead?

2005
01:41:36,580 --> 01:41:39,580
Um, well, yes.

2006
01:41:39,580 --> 01:41:42,740
It kind of died about five years ago.

2007
01:41:42,740 --> 01:41:45,780
Around the time this show stopped talking about DDR was kind of when it was starting

2008
01:41:45,780 --> 01:41:46,780
to die.

2009
01:41:46,780 --> 01:41:51,860
I mean, I hate to say it, but I don't think it'll ever die, but it's not what it was 10

2010
01:41:51,860 --> 01:41:53,380
years ago.

2011
01:41:53,380 --> 01:41:54,820
Let's face it.

2012
01:41:54,820 --> 01:41:55,820
Reality check.

2013
01:41:55,820 --> 01:41:56,820
All right.

2014
01:41:56,820 --> 01:42:01,580
Anyhow, hey, let's get into some more pleasant topics and talk a little bit about, uh, what

2015
01:42:01,580 --> 01:42:03,940
is going on in our email bag.

2016
01:42:03,940 --> 01:42:04,940
That's right.

2017
01:42:04,940 --> 01:42:10,480
Every week we invite you guys to send us emails to our email address at mailbagorangeloungeradio.com.

2018
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:14,340
And every week Dark Sakura likes to tear the mailbag open and read some of her favorite

2019
01:42:14,340 --> 01:42:17,380
emails for us to respond to here on the show.

2020
01:42:17,380 --> 01:42:22,380
So Dark Sakura dive into the mailbag and tell us what emails are we getting this week?

2021
01:42:22,380 --> 01:42:25,900
Well, we got one recent, it was one of the ones that were deleted when I was getting

2022
01:42:25,900 --> 01:42:26,900
rid of the spam.

2023
01:42:26,900 --> 01:42:29,220
Um, so I'll go ahead and read it first.

2024
01:42:29,220 --> 01:42:31,380
Um, hi, OLR crew, AZHP here.

2025
01:42:31,380 --> 01:42:35,820
I was listening to your podcast from the 10th and her Jamie brush off the rock star forced

2026
01:42:35,820 --> 01:42:38,620
overtime deal because they would get time and a half.

2027
01:42:38,620 --> 01:42:41,980
I work in the programming industry as well, and I can tell you with a percent certainty

2028
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:45,860
that pretty much no one in the entire industry in California gets paid a cent of overtime

2029
01:42:45,860 --> 01:42:46,860
furthermore.

2030
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:49,820
And this is generally the norm for the games industry in general.

2031
01:42:49,820 --> 01:42:53,980
Employees are forced to work 12 hours, six to seven days a week with no overtime pay,

2032
01:42:53,980 --> 01:42:58,900
no compensation for PTO, no bonuses, and sometimes even no vacation by the way, PTO is paid time

2033
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:01,900
off for those who don't speak office speak.

2034
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:04,620
Sometimes even a vacation after project is finished.

2035
01:43:04,620 --> 01:43:08,340
There are also generally threats of dismissal if one does not go into work.

2036
01:43:08,340 --> 01:43:13,460
These people are so fatigued getting one or zero days off that week, they make them more

2037
01:43:13,460 --> 01:43:16,840
and more mistakes and they have to stay even longer to fix them.

2038
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:20,400
There is a law in California that says you can be exempt from getting paid overtime if

2039
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:23,020
you make more than $90,000 in a year.

2040
01:43:23,020 --> 01:43:26,040
However, game developers generally make about half that.

2041
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:32,880
It might seem like a decent salary, but when you're working 100 hours, 100 hour work weeks,

2042
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:35,300
it equates to about $14 an hour.

2043
01:43:35,300 --> 01:43:37,500
Now you might say, take it up with the law or quit.

2044
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:41,140
However, these people are so overworked that they don't have the time to file a lawsuit.

2045
01:43:41,140 --> 01:43:44,620
And getting into the industry is so hard because there are so few studios owned by even fewer

2046
01:43:44,620 --> 01:43:48,740
publishers that it's 100 times harder to get a job in the games industry than it is any

2047
01:43:48,740 --> 01:43:50,900
other job, especially in our economic climate.

2048
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:54,580
I'm sorry for the lengthy rant, but I was appalled at the complacency of the crew on

2049
01:43:54,580 --> 01:43:58,340
reporting on the story and wanted everyone to know the true nature of the beast so that

2050
01:43:58,340 --> 01:44:01,960
they could understand what most game developers go through to bring you the games you love

2051
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:02,960
to play.

2052
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:03,960
Yours truly, AZHP.

2053
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:06,300
PS, sorry about the terrible Silent Hill joke last time.

2054
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:07,300
I just had to.

2055
01:44:07,300 --> 01:44:13,140
Now my point is, is that it's because no one says anything that this shit continues.

2056
01:44:13,140 --> 01:44:15,280
I kind of, I sort of agree.

2057
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:17,780
Like I don't, I don't want to say I'm complacent with this.

2058
01:44:17,780 --> 01:44:21,540
I mean it does strike me as very wrong, but at the same time I feel like I don't know

2059
01:44:21,540 --> 01:44:25,720
enough about that perspective because most of the people I know that work for developers

2060
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:27,580
aren't making these same complaints.

2061
01:44:27,580 --> 01:44:30,860
And I don't know if it's because of, and it's addressed in that email, the fear of if they

2062
01:44:30,860 --> 01:44:32,900
speak up, they're going to get fired.

2063
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:37,260
But if everything that's in that email is true, that's bullshit.

2064
01:44:37,260 --> 01:44:38,300
Of course it's bullshit.

2065
01:44:38,300 --> 01:44:42,620
And maybe the wife should be speaking up and somebody has got to stand up for these people

2066
01:44:42,620 --> 01:44:44,100
and put a stop to this.

2067
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:47,060
By the way though, you don't have to make 90,000 a year to be exempt from overtime.

2068
01:44:47,060 --> 01:44:48,060
Trust me, I know.

2069
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:49,060
Yeah, no.

2070
01:44:49,060 --> 01:44:53,860
But if you, if you are an exempt employee, then your overtime is counted in other ways.

2071
01:44:53,860 --> 01:44:57,500
But yes, there are still boundaries.

2072
01:44:57,500 --> 01:45:02,060
You know, I, I don't like to talk a lot about my day job because I don't want to ever jeopardize

2073
01:45:02,060 --> 01:45:03,060
that here on the show.

2074
01:45:03,060 --> 01:45:04,620
But I will say these few key things.

2075
01:45:04,620 --> 01:45:09,900
I am an exempt employee where I work, but anytime I do have to work those extra hours,

2076
01:45:09,900 --> 01:45:13,380
my company is very good about balancing it out.

2077
01:45:13,380 --> 01:45:14,380
I don't ever feel...

2078
01:45:14,380 --> 01:45:15,860
You get basically comped time, right?

2079
01:45:15,860 --> 01:45:16,860
In a way.

2080
01:45:16,860 --> 01:45:20,380
I think I should reveal those types of things on the show, but you know, there, there, there

2081
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:24,380
are ways they make up for it and I don't feel overworked and everybody should have that.

2082
01:45:24,380 --> 01:45:27,540
I've had times at my job where they say, oh, we've got mandatory overtime this weekend.

2083
01:45:27,540 --> 01:45:29,940
And I'm like, I'm not coming.

2084
01:45:29,940 --> 01:45:30,940
Why not?

2085
01:45:30,940 --> 01:45:32,400
Um, I'm not coming.

2086
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:33,820
I have other things to do.

2087
01:45:33,820 --> 01:45:34,820
I made plans.

2088
01:45:34,820 --> 01:45:35,820
Sorry, I'm not coming.

2089
01:45:35,820 --> 01:45:38,180
And they'll be like, oh, well, okay.

2090
01:45:38,180 --> 01:45:41,780
Cause they cannot make you work mandatory overtime.

2091
01:45:41,780 --> 01:45:47,060
They just say mandatory because they're strongly suggesting it because they need to have the

2092
01:45:47,060 --> 01:45:48,060
people there.

2093
01:45:48,060 --> 01:45:52,740
And maybe it's mandatory for them to request the overtime, but it's not mandatory that

2094
01:45:52,740 --> 01:45:53,740
you take it.

2095
01:45:53,740 --> 01:45:57,460
That you, you know, go in and work on your day off.

2096
01:45:57,460 --> 01:45:59,540
We have a law for a reason.

2097
01:45:59,540 --> 01:46:06,820
And if, I'm sorry, I really don't feel very sorry for these people who, well, okay.

2098
01:46:06,820 --> 01:46:10,640
I actually, no, I don't feel sorry because yeah, it sucks that they have, they're having

2099
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:15,420
such a hard time, but as long as they're not doing anything to change it, you know, then

2100
01:46:15,420 --> 01:46:17,460
they're just adding to the problem.

2101
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:18,460
They're adding to the problem.

2102
01:46:18,460 --> 01:46:19,660
Well, maybe that's why the wives are speaking out.

2103
01:46:19,660 --> 01:46:23,020
Maybe, maybe people, I mean, I can see what he's saying in the email there about there

2104
01:46:23,020 --> 01:46:26,580
is a very real fear that if I speak up, I'm going to be fired.

2105
01:46:26,580 --> 01:46:27,900
I could see that.

2106
01:46:27,900 --> 01:46:28,900
But that's illegal.

2107
01:46:28,900 --> 01:46:30,900
It's a tough industry to crack into.

2108
01:46:30,900 --> 01:46:33,880
But it still doesn't change the fact of what the law is.

2109
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:38,140
I don't want to get too political here, but is it just throwing ideas out there?

2110
01:46:38,140 --> 01:46:44,260
Is it possible that there could be a union of developers and people that work in the

2111
01:46:44,260 --> 01:46:45,260
game industry?

2112
01:46:45,260 --> 01:46:46,500
I mean, maybe that's what's needed.

2113
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:47,500
I would say so.

2114
01:46:47,500 --> 01:46:51,180
I mean, if, if it seems like- Do we need Sally Field to jump up on a table

2115
01:46:51,180 --> 01:46:55,020
with her sign about starting a union?

2116
01:46:55,020 --> 01:47:04,500
Well, I, I think that if anyone is working in that kind of condition, the, it doesn't

2117
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:06,460
matter how exhausted they are.

2118
01:47:06,460 --> 01:47:13,220
You know, if someone does not think enough of themselves, their family, and doing work

2119
01:47:13,220 --> 01:47:19,140
that they enjoy to try to make their workplace a better place to be, then they don't need

2120
01:47:19,140 --> 01:47:20,140
to be there.

2121
01:47:20,140 --> 01:47:23,540
Uh, one of our listeners in chat, I'll, I'll, I'll withhold their name here because they

2122
01:47:23,540 --> 01:47:27,780
are saying something somewhat negative, uh, says, it's hard to say no to our Sakura.

2123
01:47:27,780 --> 01:47:33,620
Once is okay, twice you don't get a raise and all the industry is connected.

2124
01:47:33,620 --> 01:47:36,140
I mean, I, he's speaking to that same fear.

2125
01:47:36,140 --> 01:47:38,820
I mean, I get what you're saying, but I get what he's saying.

2126
01:47:38,820 --> 01:47:41,300
There's got, something has to give.

2127
01:47:41,300 --> 01:47:42,300
You know what I mean?

2128
01:47:42,300 --> 01:47:43,300
Well, that goes back to the same thing.

2129
01:47:43,300 --> 01:47:46,780
If you are unhappy with the environment, you change it.

2130
01:47:46,780 --> 01:47:50,660
You know, one person may be one person, but for every one person that has a particular,

2131
01:47:50,660 --> 01:47:56,280
uh, distaste for something, there are going to be at least eight other people around them,

2132
01:47:56,280 --> 01:48:00,060
very close to them that have that same feeling.

2133
01:48:00,060 --> 01:48:03,540
And sometimes all it takes is for one person to say something before everybody else decides,

2134
01:48:03,540 --> 01:48:05,100
Hey, yeah, we agree.

2135
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:07,420
Well, this issue is long from over.

2136
01:48:07,420 --> 01:48:08,460
I'm sure about that.

2137
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:10,940
Maybe it's going to end up being the wives that take this on.

2138
01:48:10,940 --> 01:48:11,940
I don't know.

2139
01:48:11,940 --> 01:48:14,460
It's going to be very interesting to see what develops, but for now we should probably move

2140
01:48:14,460 --> 01:48:18,780
on to another email.

2141
01:48:18,780 --> 01:48:20,620
One comes from lucky nuts.

2142
01:48:20,620 --> 01:48:23,340
Hey, Jamie keeps talking about her vault.

2143
01:48:23,340 --> 01:48:28,060
I too have a vault that I've kept for the last 20 years or so, and I'm considering spending

2144
01:48:28,060 --> 01:48:32,900
the next few months clearing it out on eBay to buy more grownup things like a new sailboat.

2145
01:48:32,900 --> 01:48:35,820
Have you ever thought about clearing out your collection and if so, did you later regret

2146
01:48:35,820 --> 01:48:36,820
it?

2147
01:48:36,820 --> 01:48:40,260
Um, first of all, grownup is a concept.

2148
01:48:40,260 --> 01:48:46,660
You know, you're getting rid of one thing for recreation to get another thing for recreation.

2149
01:48:46,660 --> 01:48:48,500
Grownup is bullshit.

2150
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:51,140
You know, so drop that little attitude right there.

2151
01:48:51,140 --> 01:48:56,660
I hate that attitude so much and no, I'm not getting rid of the collection ever.

2152
01:48:56,660 --> 01:48:57,660
I love our collection.

2153
01:48:57,660 --> 01:48:58,660
I go back and use all this stuff.

2154
01:48:58,660 --> 01:49:00,780
I get, I'm happy just looking at it.

2155
01:49:00,780 --> 01:49:04,940
Like, I like going in the vault and just looking around and going, damn, we got some cool shit.

2156
01:49:04,940 --> 01:49:05,940
Look at all this shit.

2157
01:49:05,940 --> 01:49:06,940
I know.

2158
01:49:06,940 --> 01:49:07,940
That's just how I feel.

2159
01:49:07,940 --> 01:49:11,660
And then she'll invite other people over, Rob, Rob, come over and look at all my shit.

2160
01:49:11,660 --> 01:49:14,660
Come over here and help me play with this.

2161
01:49:14,660 --> 01:49:19,500
You know, and by the way, if you go to our YouTube channel, um, you can actually see

2162
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:23,220
some video taken in the vault if you want to see what I have.

2163
01:49:23,220 --> 01:49:26,140
And if you are going to sell some of your stuff though, talk to me.

2164
01:49:26,140 --> 01:49:27,140
Nice.

2165
01:49:27,140 --> 01:49:29,660
Maybe you'll have something I want.

2166
01:49:29,660 --> 01:49:34,580
I just to say from, from a non-collector perspective, I've sold some of my stuff.

2167
01:49:34,580 --> 01:49:37,900
I've never really regretted it though, cause I try to really think about it and not sell

2168
01:49:37,900 --> 01:49:40,060
anything that I think I might remotely play again.

2169
01:49:40,060 --> 01:49:43,860
Like I think I sold my copy of Dead or Alive for, I just knew I wasn't going to play that

2170
01:49:43,860 --> 01:49:44,860
again.

2171
01:49:44,860 --> 01:49:47,460
Misty said she was happy looking at it while she was visiting.

2172
01:49:47,460 --> 01:49:49,780
There you go.

2173
01:49:49,780 --> 01:49:54,220
Um, now I did get two emails from one other person, but I'm only going to read one of

2174
01:49:54,220 --> 01:49:58,540
them because really the first one was all like, I like Silent Hill Shattered Memories.

2175
01:49:58,540 --> 01:50:02,880
Can I say though real quick though, if you did sell your collection and buy the sailboat,

2176
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:07,740
you know that you could say, I'm on a boat.

2177
01:50:07,740 --> 01:50:09,580
You know, that's one of my ringtones on my phone.

2178
01:50:09,580 --> 01:50:10,580
Is it?

2179
01:50:10,580 --> 01:50:11,580
I'm not surprised.

2180
01:50:11,580 --> 01:50:13,020
It's the one when, uh, when work calls.

2181
01:50:13,020 --> 01:50:14,100
That's why you buy the sailboat.

2182
01:50:14,100 --> 01:50:15,100
You want to say I'm on a boat.

2183
01:50:15,100 --> 01:50:17,020
I don't want to be on a boat.

2184
01:50:17,020 --> 01:50:19,940
I want to play my games.

2185
01:50:19,940 --> 01:50:21,380
Games are more versatile than a sailboat.

2186
01:50:21,380 --> 01:50:25,420
You can, you can go in your house unless your electricity is off.

2187
01:50:25,420 --> 01:50:27,620
You can play your games anytime.

2188
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:30,620
That's a dark Sakura song would be, I got a vault.

2189
01:50:30,620 --> 01:50:32,420
I got a vault, motherfucker.

2190
01:50:32,420 --> 01:50:33,420
A vault.

2191
01:50:33,420 --> 01:50:37,700
But you can only go on your sailboat, first of all, if you're licensed for it.

2192
01:50:37,700 --> 01:50:41,620
A sailboat is going to give you a lot more cost and upkeep and storage.

2193
01:50:41,620 --> 01:50:46,500
Dude, you're going to save yourself some money just by keeping your games and renting a boat

2194
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:47,620
for a weekend.

2195
01:50:47,620 --> 01:50:48,620
The end.

2196
01:50:48,620 --> 01:50:50,860
Cause then you don't have to do all the crap to it.

2197
01:50:50,860 --> 01:50:52,260
God, I'm smart.

2198
01:50:52,260 --> 01:50:56,140
I should just be a financial advisor even though I kind of, you know, kind of suck at

2199
01:50:56,140 --> 01:50:57,140
it.

2200
01:50:57,140 --> 01:50:58,140
You're a goddamn boat idiot.

2201
01:50:58,140 --> 01:51:00,380
You don't need a boat.

2202
01:51:00,380 --> 01:51:02,540
You need a- Fuck boats.

2203
01:51:02,540 --> 01:51:03,540
Rent it.

2204
01:51:03,540 --> 01:51:05,340
Jamie, you need a- Charter a boat.

2205
01:51:05,340 --> 01:51:08,100
Jamie, you need a financial advice podcast.

2206
01:51:08,100 --> 01:51:09,100
Fuck no.

2207
01:51:09,100 --> 01:51:15,120
It would be nothing but Dan yelling at me for spending too much money on comics.

2208
01:51:15,120 --> 01:51:16,120
Fuck rent.

2209
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:17,120
Buy comics.

2210
01:51:17,120 --> 01:51:21,340
So anyway, I'm going to read just the one email.

2211
01:51:21,340 --> 01:51:27,620
Um, hello from Haseo- Haseo Sumiragawa.

2212
01:51:27,620 --> 01:51:35,540
Yeah this person, um, is, uh, yeah, anyway, and yes, DarkSakura, my grammar has greatly

2213
01:51:35,540 --> 01:51:41,780
improved except you're not using any capital letters and you misspelled grammar.

2214
01:51:41,780 --> 01:51:46,140
I was wondering if you guys have ever played the MMO Mabinogi.

2215
01:51:46,140 --> 01:51:49,720
If so, have you- why have you guys never mentioned it?

2216
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:50,820
Because we haven't.

2217
01:51:50,820 --> 01:51:51,820
Never heard of it.

2218
01:51:51,820 --> 01:51:52,820
Ever.

2219
01:51:52,820 --> 01:51:53,820
Why not try it?

2220
01:51:53,820 --> 01:51:59,260
I mean, it's a lot like World of Warcraft except for Mabi is PS3, the two- okay, is

2221
01:51:59,260 --> 01:52:04,340
the PS3 of the two you pay for nothing except pet next to your characters unless you are

2222
01:52:04,340 --> 01:52:05,340
smart enough?

2223
01:52:05,340 --> 01:52:06,340
Uh, whatever.

2224
01:52:06,340 --> 01:52:07,340
Is this spam?

2225
01:52:07,340 --> 01:52:08,340
No, it's- Alright, just checking.

2226
01:52:08,340 --> 01:52:13,340
You know, I'm wondering if you- I really can't read this.

2227
01:52:13,340 --> 01:52:17,540
Do you know how easy it would be to- okay, I'll come stand behind you.

2228
01:52:17,540 --> 01:52:22,860
Okay, also on another note, the gift Rob got from Loki, where would I find when you can

2229
01:52:22,860 --> 01:52:25,600
play an NES game on it?

2230
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:27,580
It's an FC Mobile, look it up online.

2231
01:52:27,580 --> 01:52:28,580
eBay.

2232
01:52:28,580 --> 01:52:32,300
Also I make AMVs from video- there's actually a couple sites that sell them to you.

2233
01:52:32,300 --> 01:52:37,100
Also I make AMVs from video games and I was wondering, can you guys have any ideas for

2234
01:52:37,100 --> 01:52:38,100
an AMV?

2235
01:52:38,100 --> 01:52:41,980
Yes, there should be an AMV where the main character is learning proper spelling and

2236
01:52:41,980 --> 01:52:42,980
grammar.

2237
01:52:42,980 --> 01:52:44,400
It'd be fascinating.

2238
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:45,900
Also update the podcast more often.

2239
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:46,900
Probably not.

2240
01:52:46,900 --> 01:52:47,900
Okay, dude.

2241
01:52:47,900 --> 01:52:48,900
I'm sorry.

2242
01:52:48,900 --> 01:52:52,460
Also, spammers need to be raped with a flaya warhead.

2243
01:52:52,460 --> 01:52:55,340
Now that I can get behind.

2244
01:52:55,340 --> 01:52:56,340
No pun intended.

2245
01:52:56,340 --> 01:53:02,260
I'm sorry, I- you're- I can't read your email because it doesn't make sense in my brain.

2246
01:53:02,260 --> 01:53:07,660
I'm sorry, I'll look at your YouTube videos, but your email hurts my head.

2247
01:53:07,660 --> 01:53:08,660
Alright.

2248
01:53:08,660 --> 01:53:09,660
I'm sorry.

2249
01:53:09,660 --> 01:53:10,660
I tried!

2250
01:53:10,660 --> 01:53:12,660
Are there any other emails?

2251
01:53:12,660 --> 01:53:15,500
No, well there was another one written by the same person, but again-

2252
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:17,220
Yes, read it, please, please, please!

2253
01:53:17,220 --> 01:53:19,220
I love Silent Hill.

2254
01:53:19,220 --> 01:53:20,220
Okay, fine!

2255
01:53:20,220 --> 01:53:21,220
Shit.

2256
01:53:21,220 --> 01:53:25,620
Okay, first off, this was the first Silent Hill game I've played, so be nice, DarkSakura.

2257
01:53:25,620 --> 01:53:27,180
Do I have to?

2258
01:53:27,180 --> 01:53:29,740
Okay, this is a remake of the original- Too late.

2259
01:53:29,740 --> 01:53:32,220
You play as Harry Masons whose daughter is missing, blah blah blah.

2260
01:53:32,220 --> 01:53:33,900
We know all that.

2261
01:53:33,900 --> 01:53:36,420
Um, the gameplay is seamless.

2262
01:53:36,420 --> 01:53:46,900
Love the PSP, your trusty flashlight, adds an extra compen- commentary pending what you're

2263
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:47,900
looking at.

2264
01:53:47,900 --> 01:53:48,900
Yeah.

2265
01:53:48,900 --> 01:53:49,900
Sorry, I can't.

2266
01:53:49,900 --> 01:53:55,220
Also, though, but I do like this, the nightmare sequences are a pain in the ass without weapons.

2267
01:53:55,220 --> 01:53:58,820
Um, go back and play the first Silent Hill.

2268
01:53:58,820 --> 01:53:59,820
Can I try?

2269
01:53:59,820 --> 01:54:00,820
Can I try reading the review?

2270
01:54:00,820 --> 01:54:02,140
Would you mind if I give it a shot?

2271
01:54:02,140 --> 01:54:03,140
Give it a try, Rob.

2272
01:54:03,140 --> 01:54:06,300
Hold on one minute, I'm gonna- I gotta bring it up here in studio here, and I will read

2273
01:54:06,300 --> 01:54:07,300
the review for you guys.

2274
01:54:07,300 --> 01:54:08,300
Okay, cause it's really bad.

2275
01:54:08,300 --> 01:54:09,300
Okay, hold on.

2276
01:54:09,300 --> 01:54:10,820
Alright, hold on, I'm getting in there.

2277
01:54:10,820 --> 01:54:12,420
Let's see, what is- Silent Hill Shadow Memories?

2278
01:54:12,420 --> 01:54:14,100
That would be the one.

2279
01:54:14,100 --> 01:54:21,540
Will this review involve- Okay, first off, this was the first Silent Hill game I've played,

2280
01:54:21,540 --> 01:54:23,540
so be nice, DarkSakura.

2281
01:54:23,540 --> 01:54:25,620
First off, this is a remake of the original.

2282
01:54:25,620 --> 01:54:28,920
You play as Harry Mason whose daughter is missing, and you travel through the mysterious

2283
01:54:28,920 --> 01:54:31,860
small town of Silent while searching for her.

2284
01:54:31,860 --> 01:54:33,940
Gameplay is seamless of the PSP.

2285
01:54:33,940 --> 01:54:37,780
Your trusty flashlight adds an extra commentary pending what you are looking at.

2286
01:54:37,780 --> 01:54:42,140
You have a cell phone to take pictures of static memoirs and whatnot.

2287
01:54:42,140 --> 01:54:47,480
The most annoying part of the game is the physiatrist who pops up and pisses you off,

2288
01:54:47,480 --> 01:54:50,940
and the nightmare sequences are a pain in the ass without weapons.

2289
01:54:50,940 --> 01:54:55,960
The story changes pending on how you talk with the physiarist you could get ending where

2290
01:54:55,960 --> 01:54:59,500
she's not found or one where blah blah blah spoilers.

2291
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:02,180
The game is more fuck with your head than super scary.

2292
01:55:02,180 --> 01:55:06,220
I give it a 4.5 out of 5.

2293
01:55:06,220 --> 01:55:11,140
I thought for sure you were going to use one of the audio effects on our new mixing board,

2294
01:55:11,140 --> 01:55:12,300
but I was wrong.

2295
01:55:12,300 --> 01:55:13,300
You went back old dude.

2296
01:55:13,300 --> 01:55:14,300
Echo voice, Rob!

2297
01:55:14,300 --> 01:55:15,300
Echo voice!

2298
01:55:15,300 --> 01:55:16,300
You want echo voice?

2299
01:55:16,300 --> 01:55:17,300
Echo voice.

2300
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:18,300
Hold on.

2301
01:55:18,300 --> 01:55:19,300
Ooh.

2302
01:55:19,300 --> 01:55:22,300
I own your soul.

2303
01:55:22,300 --> 01:55:23,300
Whoa!

2304
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:29,140
I give it a 4.5 out of 5.

2305
01:55:29,140 --> 01:55:30,260
Okay that's enough of that for real.

2306
01:55:30,260 --> 01:55:32,860
It sounds like you're at the back end of a tunnel Rob.

2307
01:55:32,860 --> 01:55:33,860
Alright.

2308
01:55:33,860 --> 01:55:35,940
New mixing boards are fun.

2309
01:55:35,940 --> 01:55:36,940
That's it for the mailbag?

2310
01:55:36,940 --> 01:55:37,940
Yep.

2311
01:55:37,940 --> 01:55:38,940
Alright.

2312
01:55:38,940 --> 01:55:44,380
Uh, let's move on then to the FUs of the week because sometimes we get angsty here on this

2313
01:55:44,380 --> 01:55:45,380
show.

2314
01:55:45,380 --> 01:55:46,380
That poor guy is never going to email us again.

2315
01:55:46,380 --> 01:55:49,420
But if you want to have your emails ready to kill, please send them to mailbag at orange

2316
01:55:49,420 --> 01:55:50,700
launch radio dot com.

2317
01:55:50,700 --> 01:55:54,940
Just remember, we have Yakety Sax ready to go whenever we need it.

2318
01:55:54,940 --> 01:56:13,660
We also have the angsty music ready to go for the FUs of the week.

2319
01:56:13,660 --> 01:56:14,660
Fuck you Cryptic.

2320
01:56:14,660 --> 01:56:17,780
For your damn servers.

2321
01:56:17,780 --> 01:56:21,620
Make your servers hold more people so that I don't have to play a laggy STO.

2322
01:56:21,620 --> 01:56:22,620
The end.

2323
01:56:22,620 --> 01:56:23,620
Loki.

2324
01:56:23,620 --> 01:56:30,300
FU to people that break into my car and apparently there is a dude, or somebody, I'm assuming

2325
01:56:30,300 --> 01:56:36,620
it's a dude, that broke into my car last night because I had boxes in the back of my car

2326
01:56:36,620 --> 01:56:42,700
to give to my coworker who's moving and those boxes were of a microwave and computers and

2327
01:56:42,700 --> 01:56:43,700
whatnot.

2328
01:56:43,700 --> 01:56:46,660
And so they thought, hey look, microwave and computers.

2329
01:56:46,660 --> 01:56:50,340
So they broke the back window, pulled the box out and go, hey, this is a box.

2330
01:56:50,340 --> 01:56:52,220
What the hell is this?

2331
01:56:52,220 --> 01:56:57,660
Unfortunately under those boxes was my rifle bag with all my airsoft guns and they decided

2332
01:56:57,660 --> 01:56:59,460
to take that in protest.

2333
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:01,420
So I am without airsoft guns.

2334
01:57:01,420 --> 01:57:03,460
So you gave a thief guns.

2335
01:57:03,460 --> 01:57:04,460
Good move, Loki.

2336
01:57:04,460 --> 01:57:05,460
I gave a thief fake guns.

2337
01:57:05,460 --> 01:57:09,660
Well, I gave him guns without batteries or any of the ammo because he didn't take any

2338
01:57:09,660 --> 01:57:10,660
of the ammo.

2339
01:57:10,660 --> 01:57:11,940
It was just sitting right there.

2340
01:57:11,940 --> 01:57:12,940
Whatever.

2341
01:57:12,940 --> 01:57:16,500
You know, I don't care because I haven't played airsoft in over a year or so.

2342
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:22,260
It's so sad, but if I want more airsoft guns I'll just buy more.

2343
01:57:22,260 --> 01:57:23,260
I have arcade stuff to play.

2344
01:57:23,260 --> 01:57:30,220
I don't have time to play airsoft and it's been too, the weather's been crappy, so.

2345
01:57:30,220 --> 01:57:35,940
It's unfortunate, but it's not like, I'm not sad by it at all.

2346
01:57:35,940 --> 01:57:44,420
Well, if that's it for your FU of the week, mine would be just more moving angst and cleaning

2347
01:57:44,420 --> 01:57:50,220
and putting things in boxes and moving it and yeah, it's everything that comes with

2348
01:57:50,220 --> 01:57:54,220
moving, but I'll be over it in a couple of weeks when it's over, I'm sure.

2349
01:57:54,220 --> 01:57:55,220
Otherwise things are good.

2350
01:57:55,220 --> 01:57:56,460
I don't have a lot to complain about.

2351
01:57:56,460 --> 01:57:57,460
Life is happy.

2352
01:57:57,460 --> 01:57:58,460
Yay.

2353
01:57:58,460 --> 01:57:59,460
Butterflies and sparkles.

2354
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:00,460
All right.

2355
01:58:00,460 --> 01:58:03,380
A couple more news stories for you guys and then your chance to interact with us live

2356
01:58:03,380 --> 01:58:08,540
on the phone on our Skype line at orange lounge radio or one eight seven seven game O L R

2357
01:58:08,540 --> 01:58:09,540
okay.

2358
01:58:09,540 --> 01:58:10,540
Yes.

2359
01:58:10,540 --> 01:58:15,900
Uh, Dante's Inferno is getting some download content, which I think is bundled actually

2360
01:58:15,900 --> 01:58:17,820
with the PlayStation three version.

2361
01:58:17,820 --> 01:58:25,580
Um, apparently someone got the game early or downloaded the game early and, um, recorded

2362
01:58:25,580 --> 01:58:30,240
a video that they sent to Kotaku, which shows a new download content that's going to have

2363
01:58:30,240 --> 01:58:35,940
some new online, um, co-op actually a new playable character along with that.

2364
01:58:35,940 --> 01:58:39,800
And there's some different, uh, trials apparently that you can play and you can create your

2365
01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:42,420
own new trials and share them online.

2366
01:58:42,420 --> 01:58:44,420
So that's kind of neat.

2367
01:58:44,420 --> 01:58:51,060
Um, but apparently if, uh, it's not in the PS three version, I know it's definitely not

2368
01:58:51,060 --> 01:58:52,440
in the three 60 version.

2369
01:58:52,440 --> 01:58:56,020
So if you do have the three 60, uh, you'll have to get it in April.

2370
01:58:56,020 --> 01:59:02,260
Um, hopefully it is included in the PS three version, in which case you'll get it immediately.

2371
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:03,780
But that's neat.

2372
01:59:03,780 --> 01:59:09,060
And um, I don't know if it's going to be free later on, but it's, uh, apparently a trailer

2373
01:59:09,060 --> 01:59:10,780
that's on the disc.

2374
01:59:10,780 --> 01:59:11,780
So.

2375
01:59:11,780 --> 01:59:12,780
All righty.

2376
01:59:12,780 --> 01:59:14,740
Uh, I got one more story for you guys.

2377
01:59:14,740 --> 01:59:18,500
Are you going to pick up Dante's Inferno by the way, just before I get to my thing?

2378
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:25,780
No, because I have Borderlands and I now have Bioshock two to play and really I'll just

2379
01:59:25,780 --> 01:59:27,740
pick up God of War three.

2380
01:59:27,740 --> 01:59:31,900
Although Dante's Inferno looked kind of cool and you know, I'm, I'm interested just to

2381
01:59:31,900 --> 01:59:37,020
kind of play through it mindlessly, but not right away.

2382
01:59:37,020 --> 01:59:41,420
I'll wait for the maybe drop in price or, and Final Fantasy 13 is right around the corner.

2383
01:59:41,420 --> 01:59:44,380
So it's like, I really don't have time to play all these games.

2384
01:59:44,380 --> 01:59:47,620
It's just, it's just too many games.

2385
01:59:47,620 --> 01:59:51,020
I'll probably put it in the queue of things to play, like on my literal, now that I use

2386
01:59:51,020 --> 01:59:55,020
a rental game, so I stopped spending 60 bucks on games every week, uh, put it in my queue

2387
01:59:55,020 --> 01:59:56,020
of things to play.

2388
01:59:56,020 --> 01:59:59,500
But you know, one thing I'm learning, you don't always get what's number one on your

2389
01:59:59,500 --> 02:00:00,500
list right away.

2390
02:00:00,500 --> 02:00:03,660
It's not quite as effective as Netflix, just so you know.

2391
02:00:03,660 --> 02:00:07,340
Anyhow, uh, one other story for you guys, and this does have to do with spending money,

2392
02:00:07,340 --> 02:00:12,580
uh, buying stuff on your computer, uh, using one of those, uh, digital distribution sites.

2393
02:00:12,580 --> 02:00:16,460
You know, Steam, they are, uh, probably the kings of what's going on.

2394
02:00:16,460 --> 02:00:23,140
But there's some other websites that sell games too, and one of them is GOG.com, GOG.com,

2395
02:00:23,140 --> 02:00:26,020
or you might call them the good old games.

2396
02:00:26,020 --> 02:00:29,700
If you think about it, it's kind of a site that tries to legitimize abandonware.

2397
02:00:29,700 --> 02:00:33,500
If you've never heard of that term before, a lot of folks like to use some weird clause

2398
02:00:33,500 --> 02:00:37,100
in copyright law, which I think some dude just made up because he wanted to justify

2399
02:00:37,100 --> 02:00:38,100
the theft.

2400
02:00:38,100 --> 02:00:42,220
Um, is that if a game hasn't been published for seven years, then it's okay to send on

2401
02:00:42,220 --> 02:00:43,220
the internet wherever you want.

2402
02:00:43,220 --> 02:00:44,620
You can, uh, send that game out there.

2403
02:00:44,620 --> 02:00:49,620
Well, uh, obviously some publishers are not having that, uh, but GOG.com or good old games

2404
02:00:49,620 --> 02:00:55,940
tries to kind of legitimize that by selling DR free, DR, I'm sorry, DRM free old games.

2405
02:00:55,940 --> 02:00:57,900
And they got some big lands this week.

2406
02:00:57,900 --> 02:01:03,460
Um, they got a deal with Activision publishing to get some, uh, Sierra classics because Activision

2407
02:01:03,460 --> 02:01:09,060
has access to those classics now, uh, and that you can't even find on steam.

2408
02:01:09,060 --> 02:01:12,180
Some of those games, by the way, that are out right now, the first two that were added

2409
02:01:12,180 --> 02:01:15,860
are Canem of Steamworks and Magic Obscura.

2410
02:01:15,860 --> 02:01:16,860
Definitely an Obscura title.

2411
02:01:16,860 --> 02:01:20,460
Cause I haven't even heard of that one, but this one I definitely knew, Gabriel Knight

2412
02:01:20,460 --> 02:01:21,460
Sins of the Fathers.

2413
02:01:21,460 --> 02:01:24,940
I don't know if you ever heard of this game, but I've heard of the Gabriel Knight games.

2414
02:01:24,940 --> 02:01:25,940
Yeah.

2415
02:01:25,940 --> 02:01:26,940
It's pretty cool.

2416
02:01:26,940 --> 02:01:28,180
Cause Tim, Tim, Tim Curry does a voice in the game.

2417
02:01:28,180 --> 02:01:32,140
It was one of his voice acting gigs, six bucks for each one of those titles.

2418
02:01:32,140 --> 02:01:35,840
They are supposed to be doing like several titles a week over the next few months.

2419
02:01:35,840 --> 02:01:39,980
So a lot of these old school classic games, if you are curious and checking them out,

2420
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:42,180
you can go to GOG.com.

2421
02:01:42,180 --> 02:01:47,680
Granted it's not the same as when that LucasArts pack was available for what, like nine bucks

2422
02:01:47,680 --> 02:01:48,680
or something.

2423
02:01:48,680 --> 02:01:52,860
Some obscenely low price on steam over the holidays, but, uh, you know, you can still

2424
02:01:52,860 --> 02:01:58,580
find some good old classic games because Loki doesn't have enough new games to play clearly.

2425
02:01:58,580 --> 02:02:01,860
So he should add some classic games to his, uh, buffet too.

2426
02:02:01,860 --> 02:02:06,780
I have plenty of games to play and I'm just trying to get through, I'm still trying to

2427
02:02:06,780 --> 02:02:13,140
sort my Maim ROM collection to eliminate all the crap I'm not going to use.

2428
02:02:13,140 --> 02:02:17,900
A lot of, several folks in chat chanting down with DRM, well that's one of their big things

2429
02:02:17,900 --> 02:02:22,140
is that they don't charge or they don't have really DRM on the games.

2430
02:02:22,140 --> 02:02:24,840
And so you can buy them and it's, you know, legitimate.

2431
02:02:24,840 --> 02:02:28,140
You can feel good karma and all that stuff and then not have to worry about the whole

2432
02:02:28,140 --> 02:02:31,940
abandonware and possibly getting viruses and all that stuff.

2433
02:02:31,940 --> 02:02:34,100
So there you go.

2434
02:02:34,100 --> 02:02:37,300
Anyhow that's going to do it for the news tonight and that's where we're going to go

2435
02:02:37,300 --> 02:02:38,580
to our Skype line.

2436
02:02:38,580 --> 02:02:44,220
It is now open 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2437
02:02:44,220 --> 02:02:48,900
We are taking your calls live on this Sunday evening, Super Bowl Sunday, February the 7th

2438
02:02:48,900 --> 02:02:49,900
of 2010.

2439
02:02:49,900 --> 02:02:53,740
While we wait for some calls to come in, Loki's got some last minute stories for us.

2440
02:02:53,740 --> 02:02:56,260
Yes, uh, I do.

2441
02:02:56,260 --> 02:02:59,300
Well I just assume you usually do.

2442
02:02:59,300 --> 02:03:02,380
If you didn't, I guess I was wrong.

2443
02:03:02,380 --> 02:03:07,220
Uh, no, actually there's some other stuff we can talk about, um, of course I don't have

2444
02:03:07,220 --> 02:03:09,460
to pull it up yet because that would be really awesome.

2445
02:03:09,460 --> 02:03:11,380
Actually we'll talk about this real quick.

2446
02:03:11,380 --> 02:03:15,860
There's a game, Tales of Innocence, which was released on DS, um, in Japan.

2447
02:03:15,860 --> 02:03:17,580
You gotta reprieve, you gotta call.

2448
02:03:17,580 --> 02:03:19,460
Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

2449
02:03:19,460 --> 02:03:22,540
Hi, this is Spaznator.

2450
02:03:22,540 --> 02:03:24,540
Hi Spaznator, what's on your mind buddy?

2451
02:03:24,540 --> 02:03:33,180
Uh, two things, um, yeah, uh, I didn't know if you guys saw my tweets earlier in the week,

2452
02:03:33,180 --> 02:03:40,060
but, um, I thought it was kind of worth mentioning, uh, there's, uh, anime series that, uh, I

2453
02:03:40,060 --> 02:03:42,060
think you guys may want to check out.

2454
02:03:42,060 --> 02:03:46,620
I, before I can go back and check with Sakura into, uh, Anime as well.

2455
02:03:46,620 --> 02:03:50,180
Wait, hold that thought, hold that thought, because speaking of anime series, I, I totally

2456
02:03:50,180 --> 02:03:53,040
forgot to get into this at the top of the show and I wanted to.

2457
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:58,380
This weekend I went to Japantown in, uh, San Francisco and I totally thought of Jamie,

2458
02:03:58,380 --> 02:04:02,780
because I, well, A, I saw the Taiyaki place that, um, I know she really loves and she

2459
02:04:02,780 --> 02:04:05,040
likes to eat there and it made me think of her.

2460
02:04:05,040 --> 02:04:09,040
And then we went to Japan video and some of those places and we were looking at, um, anime.

2461
02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:12,140
And I saw the Ragnarok anime on DVD.

2462
02:04:12,140 --> 02:04:14,660
I guess they made like 25 episodes of a Ragnarok anime.

2463
02:04:14,660 --> 02:04:16,700
Yeah, they have a whole season, it's actually pretty good.

2464
02:04:16,700 --> 02:04:17,700
I've watched most of it.

2465
02:04:17,700 --> 02:04:18,700
Have you?

2466
02:04:18,700 --> 02:04:19,700
Because it made me think of you.

2467
02:04:19,700 --> 02:04:21,380
I was like, I should get this for Jamie and then I'm thinking, no, she probably already

2468
02:04:21,380 --> 02:04:22,380
has it.

2469
02:04:22,380 --> 02:04:26,580
But actually I downloaded it when it first started coming out on TV and I never finished

2470
02:04:26,580 --> 02:04:27,580
it.

2471
02:04:27,580 --> 02:04:28,580
Oh, okay.

2472
02:04:28,580 --> 02:04:29,580
And so it actually won.

2473
02:04:29,580 --> 02:04:31,500
It was pretty cute, pretty, you know, close to the game.

2474
02:04:31,500 --> 02:04:36,500
I'm already getting the new DS one, the US one, um, cause I tried playing it in Japanese.

2475
02:04:36,500 --> 02:04:37,660
I tried.

2476
02:04:37,660 --> 02:04:42,300
But a completely, completely random tangent right next to all that stuff is a little store

2477
02:04:42,300 --> 02:04:45,420
called Pika Pika, which is a picture booth store.

2478
02:04:45,420 --> 02:04:47,860
It's one of the stores that's nothing but picture booths.

2479
02:04:47,860 --> 02:04:51,500
Now I met up in Japantown with a bunch of people that I play World of Warcraft with.

2480
02:04:51,500 --> 02:04:53,620
So it's like we had an IRL raid.

2481
02:04:53,620 --> 02:04:57,460
So we raided Pika Pika and one of the photo booths there and there was like six of us

2482
02:04:57,460 --> 02:04:58,460
in the photo booths.

2483
02:04:58,460 --> 02:05:02,620
Like it takes like $9 to take a picture, but it's all like green platforms you stand on

2484
02:05:02,620 --> 02:05:04,100
and it puts in backers.

2485
02:05:04,100 --> 02:05:06,540
We had so much picture club.

2486
02:05:06,540 --> 02:05:08,180
It was so much fun.

2487
02:05:08,180 --> 02:05:11,380
Like seriously, I think these only exist in big cities.

2488
02:05:11,380 --> 02:05:13,180
I've seen one by Arcade Infinity too.

2489
02:05:13,180 --> 02:05:16,660
There used to be one right next door there, but if you have one of these in your town,

2490
02:05:16,660 --> 02:05:17,660
it's a lot of fun.

2491
02:05:17,660 --> 02:05:18,660
Oh yeah, totally.

2492
02:05:18,660 --> 02:05:19,660
Okay.

2493
02:05:19,660 --> 02:05:20,660
Sorry.

2494
02:05:20,660 --> 02:05:21,660
What else do you want to talk about?

2495
02:05:21,660 --> 02:05:22,660
Uh, it's called Dumslinger Girl.

2496
02:05:22,660 --> 02:05:32,340
I don't know if either one of you have heard of it, but it's, uh, there's two, uh, seasons

2497
02:05:32,340 --> 02:05:33,340
of it.

2498
02:05:33,340 --> 02:05:41,380
Both are like 13 episodes long and the trick synopsis of it is, uh, you know, this government

2499
02:05:41,380 --> 02:05:48,700
agency over in, uh, really basically, uh, takes in, uh, you know, kids, they're basically

2500
02:05:48,700 --> 02:05:58,860
dying to, uh, $6 million, you know, women type cyborgs and, uh, has them, uh, do, uh,

2501
02:05:58,860 --> 02:06:04,140
assassinations for like, uh, assassinate terrorists and stuff like that.

2502
02:06:04,140 --> 02:06:08,100
So wait, Gunslinger, hold on, Gunslinger Girl was the name of the anime?

2503
02:06:08,100 --> 02:06:09,100
Yeah.

2504
02:06:09,100 --> 02:06:10,980
And you've, have you ever heard of this dark side?

2505
02:06:10,980 --> 02:06:11,980
Yes, I have.

2506
02:06:11,980 --> 02:06:12,980
I wanted to try it out.

2507
02:06:12,980 --> 02:06:14,780
It's just, you know, I haven't had a lot of time.

2508
02:06:14,780 --> 02:06:17,100
Is this something available on the PlayStation 3 marketplace?

2509
02:06:17,100 --> 02:06:21,660
Cause I know anime is like a big niche that they have on there that, uh, yes, it is.

2510
02:06:21,660 --> 02:06:28,220
Uh, there's, you know, season one and season two, and I think, uh, there's, uh, uh, I don't

2511
02:06:28,220 --> 02:06:32,300
want to call it a season three, but there is, uh, like another season there.

2512
02:06:32,300 --> 02:06:37,020
I think it's like, uh, like a reimagining of the entire series.

2513
02:06:37,020 --> 02:06:41,820
Uh, you want me when I call it like season 2.5, we were, if you want to call it that.

2514
02:06:41,820 --> 02:06:42,820
Okay.

2515
02:06:42,820 --> 02:06:43,820
Like a special, sure.

2516
02:06:43,820 --> 02:06:51,060
Yeah, but I have the entire season one and season two and I took very stuck season two

2517
02:06:51,060 --> 02:06:56,580
about a day and, oh my God, it's epic.

2518
02:06:56,580 --> 02:07:02,500
I mean, you know, it, you know, some always, you know, popping a video podcast kind of

2519
02:07:02,500 --> 02:07:08,220
like don't really like season two so much, but no, I love it personally.

2520
02:07:08,220 --> 02:07:13,140
So take that as you may, but you know, all in all it's pretty good.

2521
02:07:13,140 --> 02:07:17,140
We'll have to recommend that to the listeners and to the anime fans here in studio as well.

2522
02:07:17,140 --> 02:07:18,140
Gunslinger Girl.

2523
02:07:18,140 --> 02:07:19,140
Okay.

2524
02:07:19,140 --> 02:07:20,140
So sound really excited about that.

2525
02:07:20,140 --> 02:07:22,580
Anything else on the PlayStation network we should be checking out right now?

2526
02:07:22,580 --> 02:07:23,580
Uh, yeah.

2527
02:07:23,580 --> 02:07:28,540
Uh, it's something you kind of sort of touched on on your last show.

2528
02:07:28,540 --> 02:07:35,220
Uh, it's, uh, the new, uh, music guidance Sigma 2, uh, table for Zen Pinball.

2529
02:07:35,220 --> 02:07:36,220
Uh-huh.

2530
02:07:36,220 --> 02:07:44,300
I just stopped today and it's pretty good, uh, in fact, first of all, I think it's a

2531
02:07:44,300 --> 02:07:48,980
little bit better than some of the other tables that are currently available for the game.

2532
02:07:48,980 --> 02:07:49,980
I like Zen Pinball.

2533
02:07:49,980 --> 02:07:51,980
I'll have to check that out.

2534
02:07:51,980 --> 02:07:52,980
Yeah.

2535
02:07:52,980 --> 02:07:53,980
Yeah.

2536
02:07:53,980 --> 02:07:56,220
I'd definitely give her a thumbs up on that.

2537
02:07:56,220 --> 02:07:57,220
All right.

2538
02:07:57,220 --> 02:08:01,820
Well, uh, uh, let's get going so, uh, you can take more calls.

2539
02:08:01,820 --> 02:08:02,820
All right.

2540
02:08:02,820 --> 02:08:03,820
Yep.

2541
02:08:03,820 --> 02:08:04,820
Well, you have a good week, Spaznator.

2542
02:08:04,820 --> 02:08:07,540
Give me a phone call and we'll forgive you for the bad joke on Twitter earlier.

2543
02:08:07,540 --> 02:08:08,540
Okay.

2544
02:08:08,540 --> 02:08:09,540
All right.

2545
02:08:09,540 --> 02:08:10,540
You too, buddy.

2546
02:08:10,540 --> 02:08:11,540
Bye.

2547
02:08:11,540 --> 02:08:12,540
877 game.

2548
02:08:12,540 --> 02:08:13,540
OLRs.

2549
02:08:13,540 --> 02:08:17,540
The number to call her username on Skype is orange lounge radio.

2550
02:08:17,540 --> 02:08:22,780
Uh, by the way, taking a call from the East coast does remind me, uh, PAX East is probably

2551
02:08:22,780 --> 02:08:23,780
about what?

2552
02:08:23,780 --> 02:08:24,780
Six, seven weeks away.

2553
02:08:24,780 --> 02:08:26,020
Uh, PAX East is sold out.

2554
02:08:26,020 --> 02:08:28,020
So if you didn't get a ticket, you're out of luck.

2555
02:08:28,020 --> 02:08:30,220
Uh, I guess you maybe can still get a one day ticket.

2556
02:08:30,220 --> 02:08:33,060
Uh, and I'm going, I'm going to PAX East.

2557
02:08:33,060 --> 02:08:35,180
And I've like, really, I have tickets.

2558
02:08:35,180 --> 02:08:37,980
I, I actually just bought a regular ticket.

2559
02:08:37,980 --> 02:08:42,220
I decided I didn't want to do the media thing because a, PAX doesn't really do much for

2560
02:08:42,220 --> 02:08:43,220
media.

2561
02:08:43,220 --> 02:08:44,220
And that's fine.

2562
02:08:44,220 --> 02:08:45,220
I totally am cool with that.

2563
02:08:45,220 --> 02:08:47,700
And I think that's actually the way I wish E3 was that way.

2564
02:08:47,700 --> 02:08:52,500
Um, and so, you know, I just, I'm just, I'm going as a gamer, as a fan and you know, just

2565
02:08:52,500 --> 02:08:56,340
like the rest of you and, and don't really want to have to work through all of the packs.

2566
02:08:56,340 --> 02:08:58,320
So, uh, I'm just going to have fun.

2567
02:08:58,320 --> 02:08:59,460
So I'll be around at the show.

2568
02:08:59,460 --> 02:09:00,460
I'm going to try.

2569
02:09:00,460 --> 02:09:05,220
When the schedule comes out, I will try to find like a gaming lounge time, maybe with

2570
02:09:05,220 --> 02:09:08,060
the DS game I enjoy, uh, that I'll go be at.

2571
02:09:08,060 --> 02:09:11,660
And I'll let you guys know more about that when it gets a little closer to the show.

2572
02:09:11,660 --> 02:09:12,940
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2573
02:09:12,940 --> 02:09:13,940
Who's this?

2574
02:09:13,940 --> 02:09:14,940
Good day, sir.

2575
02:09:14,940 --> 02:09:17,220
This is Lieutenant South, tell me of USS Takahashi.

2576
02:09:17,220 --> 02:09:19,840
I'm pressing permission to come aboard.

2577
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:21,980
Are you a Star Trek Online addict as well?

2578
02:09:21,980 --> 02:09:24,180
Yeah, I just picked it up last night.

2579
02:09:24,180 --> 02:09:25,180
It's Ron Matt, everyone.

2580
02:09:25,180 --> 02:09:26,180
Yes.

2581
02:09:26,180 --> 02:09:27,180
Hi, how you doing?

2582
02:09:27,180 --> 02:09:29,140
Sir, you getting the lag too?

2583
02:09:29,140 --> 02:09:30,140
Not really.

2584
02:09:30,140 --> 02:09:34,420
Because it's, I mean, I don't think it's my graphics card.

2585
02:09:34,420 --> 02:09:39,060
I think it's their servers, but I had to wait in the queue of 118 and it takes like five,

2586
02:09:39,060 --> 02:09:41,900
you know, five whole seconds to move in any direction.

2587
02:09:41,900 --> 02:09:44,100
I have not had that problem at all.

2588
02:09:44,100 --> 02:09:47,860
And mind you, my video card is like almost three years old.

2589
02:09:47,860 --> 02:09:52,260
Yeah, mine's actually just under what the correct one is supposed to be.

2590
02:09:52,260 --> 02:09:56,180
And, but it's seriously, they say they're supposed to be increasing server capacity,

2591
02:09:56,180 --> 02:09:58,380
but they haven't yet.

2592
02:09:58,380 --> 02:09:59,380
I don't know.

2593
02:09:59,380 --> 02:10:02,420
I just haven't had that problem at all.

2594
02:10:02,420 --> 02:10:05,940
It may also be the difference in locations that we're at too, because right now I've

2595
02:10:05,940 --> 02:10:11,060
been, I just hit memory alpha and my character's all like running all over the place and there's

2596
02:10:11,060 --> 02:10:12,060
a ton of people there.

2597
02:10:12,060 --> 02:10:14,600
So maybe it has to do with location too.

2598
02:10:14,600 --> 02:10:15,600
I believe so.

2599
02:10:15,600 --> 02:10:19,140
So is this what you called in to talk about tonight at Star Trek Online or?

2600
02:10:19,140 --> 02:10:20,540
Well, that too.

2601
02:10:20,540 --> 02:10:21,540
That too.

2602
02:10:21,540 --> 02:10:26,860
Um, first thing I want to talk about, something from a couple of podcasts in the, before you

2603
02:10:26,860 --> 02:10:32,820
mention about how it's possible for Steam to sell so many games at dirt cheap prices.

2604
02:10:32,820 --> 02:10:33,820
Yes.

2605
02:10:33,820 --> 02:10:35,620
I believe I have the answer for that.

2606
02:10:35,620 --> 02:10:36,620
Please.

2607
02:10:36,620 --> 02:10:37,620
Okay.

2608
02:10:37,620 --> 02:10:41,380
I used to work in a video store and we would rent games, so on and so forth.

2609
02:10:41,380 --> 02:10:46,220
Once the rental of the game got to a certain point, we could sell it at a price because

2610
02:10:46,220 --> 02:10:50,240
all the rentals made the money back on the purchase of the game.

2611
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:54,680
My thing is with Steam, once they have this game, they sell it at that price.

2612
02:10:54,680 --> 02:10:58,980
Once they've made the money back on selling the game, they can just cut the price to as

2613
02:10:58,980 --> 02:11:03,440
cheap as they want and that shares extra cash for them.

2614
02:11:03,440 --> 02:11:07,300
But I would still think that the deals are based on percentages of sales.

2615
02:11:07,300 --> 02:11:11,060
That seems kind of odd that, you know, that it would work based on, you know, how much

2616
02:11:11,060 --> 02:11:13,380
of it sells, I guess.

2617
02:11:13,380 --> 02:11:14,380
I get what you're saying.

2618
02:11:14,380 --> 02:11:15,380
It makes sense.

2619
02:11:15,380 --> 02:11:16,380
But I don't know.

2620
02:11:16,380 --> 02:11:20,940
I think maybe the whole like retail strategy to digital distribution seems a little apples

2621
02:11:20,940 --> 02:11:21,940
to oranges.

2622
02:11:21,940 --> 02:11:22,940
I mean, you could be right though.

2623
02:11:22,940 --> 02:11:29,300
I mean, because when we rent these games, like there was one game, you know, we have

2624
02:11:29,300 --> 02:11:35,100
like five copies of Mortal Kombat, three of them will be selling for like $30 and two

2625
02:11:35,100 --> 02:11:41,060
will be selling for, I'd say, $40 because of the rental turnaround rate on those games.

2626
02:11:41,060 --> 02:11:47,020
I mean, if they get a game, they sell at this price, they make the money back off of, you

2627
02:11:47,020 --> 02:11:52,300
know, the licensing, the rights, the time it costs to be invested into it, and there

2628
02:11:52,300 --> 02:11:53,300
you go.

2629
02:11:53,300 --> 02:11:56,660
Well, I was also just the mindset, I mean, honestly, I always still kind of think the

2630
02:11:56,660 --> 02:12:00,180
reason for the sale is that, you know, assuming it is based off percentages, those companies

2631
02:12:00,180 --> 02:12:05,300
are still making $5 off a game they would have made no dollars off of had it not been

2632
02:12:05,300 --> 02:12:06,860
on Steam on a huge sale.

2633
02:12:06,860 --> 02:12:10,060
You know, some money is better than no money, a long forgotten game that got booted off

2634
02:12:10,060 --> 02:12:11,980
of shelves years ago.

2635
02:12:11,980 --> 02:12:13,660
So I don't know.

2636
02:12:13,660 --> 02:12:14,660
Good thought though.

2637
02:12:14,660 --> 02:12:15,660
I mean, anything is possible.

2638
02:12:15,660 --> 02:12:19,200
And unfortunately, until we know somebody on the inside at Steam that knows the agreements

2639
02:12:19,200 --> 02:12:21,300
of the arrangements, we just won't know.

2640
02:12:21,300 --> 02:12:24,260
Yeah, but we can go off of that for the time being.

2641
02:12:24,260 --> 02:12:25,260
All right.

2642
02:12:25,260 --> 02:12:26,260
Fine.

2643
02:12:26,260 --> 02:12:27,260
Anything else?

2644
02:12:27,260 --> 02:12:31,460
I just want to say thanks for listening, for taking the chance to listen to my podcast

2645
02:12:31,460 --> 02:12:32,460
over the weekend.

2646
02:12:32,460 --> 02:12:36,100
I have to admit I downloaded it, but I didn't listen to it yet, but I will.

2647
02:12:36,100 --> 02:12:37,520
That's fine, that's fine.

2648
02:12:37,520 --> 02:12:43,540
And if you're looking for good titles, I recommend Kidu Tenshi Angelic Layer.

2649
02:12:43,540 --> 02:12:46,020
It's free on Netflix right now.

2650
02:12:46,020 --> 02:12:50,700
What are some good animes based off of video games?

2651
02:12:50,700 --> 02:12:52,660
Remember Tower Jiraga, that old video game?

2652
02:12:52,660 --> 02:12:53,900
I do.

2653
02:12:53,900 --> 02:12:54,900
That's become an anime.

2654
02:12:54,900 --> 02:12:55,900
I believe it's been licensed.

2655
02:12:55,900 --> 02:12:56,900
Interesting.

2656
02:12:56,900 --> 02:12:59,660
Well, they had kind of a renaissance of that game a while ago, too.

2657
02:12:59,660 --> 02:13:01,500
There's a new Jiraga game, I think, on PS2.

2658
02:13:01,500 --> 02:13:02,500
That makes sense.

2659
02:13:02,500 --> 02:13:03,500
Yeah.

2660
02:13:03,500 --> 02:13:04,500
Very interesting.

2661
02:13:04,500 --> 02:13:05,940
One other quick question I have for you.

2662
02:13:05,940 --> 02:13:10,580
A movie I saw at the video store that looked hilarious, and I don't know, maybe Jamie knows

2663
02:13:10,580 --> 02:13:11,580
of this, too.

2664
02:13:11,580 --> 02:13:12,580
Apparently, it was a...

2665
02:13:12,580 --> 02:13:15,640
And I can't remember the name of it, but apparently it was a Japanese movie directed by the same

2666
02:13:15,640 --> 02:13:21,980
guy who did Ichi the Killer, and it was advertised as, um, The Sound of Music meets Dawn of the

2667
02:13:21,980 --> 02:13:22,980
Dead.

2668
02:13:22,980 --> 02:13:28,340
That, I don't know, but I believe the director was Takahashi Mike or Miike.

2669
02:13:28,340 --> 02:13:33,380
It looked hilarious from the box art, and I was wondering before I go out and either

2670
02:13:33,380 --> 02:13:37,900
spend money on that or obtain it through questionable means, if it was worth my time.

2671
02:13:37,900 --> 02:13:44,660
Um, anything along those lines of Ichi the Killer, I keep hearing is well worth the purchase.

2672
02:13:44,660 --> 02:13:50,780
I'm actually using a website I should have used a long time ago and looking up Ichi the

2673
02:13:50,780 --> 02:13:51,780
Killer on...

2674
02:13:51,780 --> 02:13:54,060
The Hills Are Alive with Sound?

2675
02:13:54,060 --> 02:13:56,200
It has another name to it, though.

2676
02:13:56,200 --> 02:13:59,100
That's like the little tagline, I think, to the...

2677
02:13:59,100 --> 02:14:00,100
It's, um...

2678
02:14:00,100 --> 02:14:02,860
The Family Something was the name of it.

2679
02:14:02,860 --> 02:14:05,140
The Happiness of the Katakris?

2680
02:14:05,140 --> 02:14:07,060
Yes, that's it.

2681
02:14:07,060 --> 02:14:09,900
That's the name of it.

2682
02:14:09,900 --> 02:14:11,020
That I've not heard of.

2683
02:14:11,020 --> 02:14:13,580
The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Screaming?

2684
02:14:13,580 --> 02:14:16,340
The Sound of Music Meets Stone of the Dead.

2685
02:14:16,340 --> 02:14:17,340
That was it.

2686
02:14:17,340 --> 02:14:18,340
That was the box I saw.

2687
02:14:18,340 --> 02:14:21,040
It's awesome because it does look exactly like, uh...

2688
02:14:21,040 --> 02:14:22,460
It made me lol for real.

2689
02:14:22,460 --> 02:14:24,140
Alright, that'd be awesome.

2690
02:14:24,140 --> 02:14:27,500
Alright, well maybe somebody else will call in later and tell me about that.

2691
02:14:27,500 --> 02:14:30,020
Alright, Ramo, we're gonna let you go so we can get more calls, but thank you as always,

2692
02:14:30,020 --> 02:14:31,460
and hey, have fun on Star Trek, okay?

2693
02:14:31,460 --> 02:14:32,460
I will.

2694
02:14:32,460 --> 02:14:33,460
Calm out.

2695
02:14:33,460 --> 02:14:34,460
1-877-GAMEL-OR.

2696
02:14:34,460 --> 02:14:42,460
At first I was like, was that a Seacrest Out thing?

2697
02:14:42,460 --> 02:14:45,140
But no, I forgot they do that in Star Trek.

2698
02:14:45,140 --> 02:14:46,140
1-877-GAMEL-OR.

2699
02:14:46,140 --> 02:14:48,300
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2700
02:14:48,300 --> 02:14:50,700
We'll take maybe one more call, I don't know.

2701
02:14:50,700 --> 02:14:51,700
We'll see how it goes.

2702
02:14:51,700 --> 02:14:55,140
Uh, Loki, I keep cutting you off, but we'll see how far we can get before we get another...

2703
02:14:55,140 --> 02:14:56,140
Oh, never mind.

2704
02:14:56,140 --> 02:14:57,140
We got another call.

2705
02:14:57,140 --> 02:14:58,140
I know.

2706
02:14:58,140 --> 02:14:59,140
You can try.

2707
02:14:59,140 --> 02:15:00,140
Psych!

2708
02:15:00,140 --> 02:15:01,140
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

2709
02:15:01,140 --> 02:15:02,140
Who's this?

2710
02:15:02,140 --> 02:15:03,260
Uh, it's the one and only Legend of Zaku.

2711
02:15:03,260 --> 02:15:05,500
Well, how are you doing, Legend of Zaku?

2712
02:15:05,500 --> 02:15:08,620
Recovering from almost a hangover this morning.

2713
02:15:08,620 --> 02:15:09,620
Nice.

2714
02:15:09,620 --> 02:15:10,980
Were you drinking before noon?

2715
02:15:10,980 --> 02:15:11,980
What's going on?

2716
02:15:11,980 --> 02:15:14,060
No, it was basically last night's drinking.

2717
02:15:14,060 --> 02:15:15,060
Oh, I see.

2718
02:15:15,060 --> 02:15:21,940
Um, let's just say that I drank to the point where I, I drank into places where, into a,

2719
02:15:21,940 --> 02:15:22,940
into a boundary.

2720
02:15:22,940 --> 02:15:23,940
Okay, okay.

2721
02:15:23,940 --> 02:15:25,940
You've got to stop, stop typing during the show.

2722
02:15:25,940 --> 02:15:26,940
Seriously.

2723
02:15:26,940 --> 02:15:27,940
You can't type right now.

2724
02:15:27,940 --> 02:15:28,940
Go ahead.

2725
02:15:28,940 --> 02:15:29,940
All right.

2726
02:15:29,940 --> 02:15:34,220
But yeah, I just wanted to bring up that whole, that whole harmonic speculation about, you

2727
02:15:34,220 --> 02:15:35,220
know, the licenses.

2728
02:15:35,220 --> 02:15:36,220
Oh yes, please.

2729
02:15:36,220 --> 02:15:41,860
Um, basically, the way I see it is that Konami, the only thing they have going for them right

2730
02:15:41,860 --> 02:15:44,320
now is lawyers.

2731
02:15:44,320 --> 02:15:49,980
In other words, they sued Roxer over ITG and they managed to win that case single-handedly

2732
02:15:49,980 --> 02:15:52,100
and, and got their franchise.

2733
02:15:52,100 --> 02:15:54,220
Because it was a complete rip-off of DDR.

2734
02:15:54,220 --> 02:15:56,220
I, I hate to say it, but they had a right.

2735
02:15:56,220 --> 02:15:59,540
And you could probably say the same thing for whatever Harmonics is doing with whatever

2736
02:15:59,540 --> 02:16:02,340
they, we think they're doing with the, with those licenses.

2737
02:16:02,340 --> 02:16:06,820
Right, it's going to be a rip-off of Beatmania because that's exactly what DJ Hero was, except

2738
02:16:06,820 --> 02:16:07,920
it wasn't.

2739
02:16:07,920 --> 02:16:12,460
And so, you know, really, I think with a DJ game, assuming that's what they're doing,

2740
02:16:12,460 --> 02:16:13,780
we don't even know what the hell they're doing.

2741
02:16:13,780 --> 02:16:16,780
They could be doing, you know, Rockman stuff.

2742
02:16:16,780 --> 02:16:17,780
I mean, who knows?

2743
02:16:17,780 --> 02:16:18,780
Exactly.

2744
02:16:18,780 --> 02:16:22,380
I mean, Harmonics still has, uh, amplitude and frequency.

2745
02:16:22,380 --> 02:16:27,740
Where did, didn't that make them famous before, before the whole, the whole Rockman thing?

2746
02:16:27,740 --> 02:16:31,660
Harmonics was also not sued over Guitar Hero because the look and feel from Guitar Freaks

2747
02:16:31,660 --> 02:16:33,060
was completely different.

2748
02:16:33,060 --> 02:16:36,940
Whereas with IT in the groove, it, the look and feel was the exact same as DDR.

2749
02:16:36,940 --> 02:16:41,200
I mean, right on down to the backgrounds and animations and, and pretty much the way the

2750
02:16:41,200 --> 02:16:42,200
arrows looked.

2751
02:16:42,200 --> 02:16:43,200
They added mines.

2752
02:16:43,200 --> 02:16:44,200
Woo!

2753
02:16:44,200 --> 02:16:45,200
You know what I mean?

2754
02:16:45,200 --> 02:16:49,460
Well, we also have to keep in mind that, uh, I mean, you could have said the same thing

2755
02:16:49,460 --> 02:16:50,460
for Pump It Up.

2756
02:16:50,460 --> 02:16:53,460
Wasn't that almost a rip-off of DDR with those arrows?

2757
02:16:53,460 --> 02:16:59,420
I think though that went back, I want to say Konami and Amiro made an agreement many years

2758
02:16:59,420 --> 02:17:03,340
ago because Pump It Up was actually first.

2759
02:17:03,340 --> 02:17:05,660
But anyhow, I don't want to rehash that old news.

2760
02:17:05,660 --> 02:17:06,660
I get it though.

2761
02:17:06,660 --> 02:17:07,660
Okay.

2762
02:17:07,660 --> 02:17:10,300
So, so the lawyers in, in litigation is how Konami keeps their franchises going.

2763
02:17:10,300 --> 02:17:14,780
Well, that all depends on how, how, you know, how harmonics is actually going to approach

2764
02:17:14,780 --> 02:17:19,500
this, whether or not they're actually going to reinvent the same four panel dance, dance

2765
02:17:19,500 --> 02:17:24,580
paradigm that we've seen for, for more than a decade or they're going to go into a new

2766
02:17:24,580 --> 02:17:25,580
direction.

2767
02:17:25,580 --> 02:17:30,980
Chances are, you know, if I was a betting man, I would say, I would say the latter just

2768
02:17:30,980 --> 02:17:35,900
because they're pretty good at innovating, pretty good at innovating within, you know,

2769
02:17:35,900 --> 02:17:36,900
within rhythm.

2770
02:17:36,900 --> 02:17:40,740
You know, and all, here's the thing though, all of this is speculation though.

2771
02:17:40,740 --> 02:17:45,700
I mean, they could be licensing these songs for rock band for some weird little pop expansion

2772
02:17:45,700 --> 02:17:46,700
they're doing.

2773
02:17:46,700 --> 02:17:47,700
We don't know.

2774
02:17:47,700 --> 02:17:48,700
You know, it could be nothing.

2775
02:17:48,700 --> 02:17:52,540
I don't see those songs in particular being something that, that would blend well with

2776
02:17:52,540 --> 02:17:55,380
rock band, you know, completely.

2777
02:17:55,380 --> 02:17:58,780
The way I see it is that they're going to do something, they're, they're doing something

2778
02:17:58,780 --> 02:18:01,500
outside of rock band with that.

2779
02:18:01,500 --> 02:18:05,620
Or rock band three is, is something we haven't thought of yet.

2780
02:18:05,620 --> 02:18:09,980
I think PAX East is probably going to give us some clues because, you know, Harmonics

2781
02:18:09,980 --> 02:18:12,140
is a huge, Harmonics is in Boston.

2782
02:18:12,140 --> 02:18:13,720
This is happening in their backyard.

2783
02:18:13,720 --> 02:18:16,620
So this is the perfect place for them to make an announcement.

2784
02:18:16,620 --> 02:18:20,660
I think Harmonics is the kind of company that will drop a bomb at PAX East.

2785
02:18:20,660 --> 02:18:26,780
See, I would love to, to go and see it for myself, but since I was, since I was unemployed

2786
02:18:26,780 --> 02:18:32,920
and up until last week, there was no way, there was no way I would have gotten tickets

2787
02:18:32,920 --> 02:18:34,340
well in advance.

2788
02:18:34,340 --> 02:18:38,100
Well congratulations on, uh, getting employment though, that's, that's good news, all things

2789
02:18:38,100 --> 02:18:39,100
considered.

2790
02:18:39,100 --> 02:18:40,100
Right.

2791
02:18:40,100 --> 02:18:46,260
But I guess, I guess time will tell to, you know, on what's going to happen, whether or

2792
02:18:46,260 --> 02:18:48,340
not they make good use of those licenses.

2793
02:18:48,340 --> 02:18:49,340
Exactly.

2794
02:18:49,340 --> 02:18:53,260
And keep in mind, I will be, you know, whatever Harmonics puts out, if they do bring it to

2795
02:18:53,260 --> 02:18:58,060
PAX East and I get a chance to get my grubby little hands on it, I will give it my critical

2796
02:18:58,060 --> 02:19:01,580
eye with my music games background and I'll, I'll let y'all know.

2797
02:19:01,580 --> 02:19:02,580
Right.

2798
02:19:02,580 --> 02:19:03,580
Of course.

2799
02:19:03,580 --> 02:19:07,460
Just try to make sure you don't want to, don't give them the benefit of the doubt.

2800
02:19:07,460 --> 02:19:12,740
Try to, well try to like, uh, you know, add, press them on some hard questions, obviously

2801
02:19:12,740 --> 02:19:18,140
not, you know, not treading into NDA stuff, but, but just try to like, challenge them

2802
02:19:18,140 --> 02:19:22,700
that they, that they're trying to sell you on something that's, that you think is not

2803
02:19:22,700 --> 02:19:24,580
going to be revolutionary.

2804
02:19:24,580 --> 02:19:25,580
I'll do my best.

2805
02:19:25,580 --> 02:19:29,700
All right, Zaku, uh, any other thoughts here before we, uh, let you go?

2806
02:19:29,700 --> 02:19:34,500
Um, don't, don't drink a 40 ounce of liquor because all it, all that's going to do is

2807
02:19:34,500 --> 02:19:37,420
create, all it's going to do is purge your stomach.

2808
02:19:37,420 --> 02:19:39,420
It happened to me last night.

2809
02:19:39,420 --> 02:19:40,420
Some sage advice.

2810
02:19:40,420 --> 02:19:42,060
Have a good one, Zaku.

2811
02:19:42,060 --> 02:19:43,060
Right.

2812
02:19:43,060 --> 02:19:44,060
Later.

2813
02:19:44,060 --> 02:19:48,180
We'll go ahead and take one more call if someone wants to call in 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username

2814
02:19:48,180 --> 02:19:49,900
on Skype is ORANGELOUNGERADIO.

2815
02:19:49,900 --> 02:19:51,940
Loki, anything to tide us over?

2816
02:19:51,940 --> 02:19:55,300
250 gigabyte hard drives coming out in Japan in March.

2817
02:19:55,300 --> 02:19:56,300
Yay.

2818
02:19:56,300 --> 02:19:58,300
Probably over here eventually.

2819
02:19:58,300 --> 02:20:01,780
Uh, here's a good one.

2820
02:20:01,780 --> 02:20:06,540
Sonic the Hedgehog is rumored to be playable in Mario Galaxy 2.

2821
02:20:06,540 --> 02:20:09,300
Kind of going back to what we were talking about in part A.

2822
02:20:09,300 --> 02:20:12,700
Where if Sonic the Hedgehog 4 fails, then Sonic will just be a Nintendo character.

2823
02:20:12,700 --> 02:20:13,700
There you go.

2824
02:20:13,700 --> 02:20:14,700
There you go.

2825
02:20:14,700 --> 02:20:21,620
Uh, let's see, there's a Dish Network channel that's going to be dedicated to Tetris.

2826
02:20:21,620 --> 02:20:22,620
You can play it on your TV.

2827
02:20:22,620 --> 02:20:26,140
Didn't that come up a few weeks ago, or maybe that was the show that didn't happen, I don't

2828
02:20:26,140 --> 02:20:27,140
remember.

2829
02:20:27,140 --> 02:20:28,140
I don't remember.

2830
02:20:28,140 --> 02:20:29,140
I don't remember something about...

2831
02:20:29,140 --> 02:20:32,140
No, there was a new Tetris game in development, but it wasn't, it's not the Dish Network thing,

2832
02:20:32,140 --> 02:20:35,740
it was something about somebody was making a new Tetris.

2833
02:20:35,740 --> 02:20:37,660
I wonder if the two are related.

2834
02:20:37,660 --> 02:20:38,660
I don't know.

2835
02:20:38,660 --> 02:20:39,660
Possibly.

2836
02:20:39,660 --> 02:20:40,660
It's going to cost you $2.99 a month.

2837
02:20:40,660 --> 02:20:43,900
Really, just play it free online, you don't need to play it on your TV.

2838
02:20:43,900 --> 02:20:46,660
Play it on anything else.

2839
02:20:46,660 --> 02:20:47,660
Anything else.

2840
02:20:47,660 --> 02:20:54,460
Um, according to Game Informer, and I got my magazine today, LA Noire is no longer a

2841
02:20:54,460 --> 02:20:55,460
PS3 exclusive.

2842
02:20:55,460 --> 02:20:59,180
Oh, it's hitting the Xbox 360 as well.

2843
02:20:59,180 --> 02:21:01,940
Ugh, another one, lost.

2844
02:21:01,940 --> 02:21:03,900
That's too bad.

2845
02:21:03,900 --> 02:21:08,500
That would be pretty cool, whenever the hell it comes out.

2846
02:21:08,500 --> 02:21:09,500
Long ways away.

2847
02:21:09,500 --> 02:21:13,780
Speaking of something else that's not an exclusive anymore, High Voltage was bringing a brand

2848
02:21:13,780 --> 02:21:17,740
new game, The Grinder, which is going to be a supernatural first person shooter game,

2849
02:21:17,740 --> 02:21:22,460
originally going to be a Wii exclusive, however now it's coming to Xbox 360, PlayStation 3,

2850
02:21:22,460 --> 02:21:23,940
and PC as well.

2851
02:21:23,940 --> 02:21:27,220
And it will probably look way better than the Wii version anyways.

2852
02:21:27,220 --> 02:21:32,140
Last call, by the way, for phone calls, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is orange-lantredio,

2853
02:21:32,140 --> 02:21:35,140
if you want to call into the show, it's an empty line right now, Super Bowl Sunday's

2854
02:21:35,140 --> 02:21:36,940
a good day when everybody's distracted.

2855
02:21:36,940 --> 02:21:43,380
And Cracked In 2 had a contest to have fans submit user-made graffiti.

2856
02:21:43,380 --> 02:21:51,620
And one of the pictures that got, I guess, won, was of these two male agents making out.

2857
02:21:51,620 --> 02:21:54,340
Which is pretty awesome.

2858
02:21:54,340 --> 02:21:55,900
Interesting.

2859
02:21:55,900 --> 02:21:57,220
Huh.

2860
02:21:57,220 --> 02:22:03,620
I, okay, whatever, hey.

2861
02:22:03,620 --> 02:22:04,620
That's all I have.

2862
02:22:04,620 --> 02:22:05,620
That's it.

2863
02:22:05,620 --> 02:22:06,620
Alright.

2864
02:22:06,620 --> 02:22:12,140
I, oh, we just in the nick of time got another call, let's take this and then we'll wrap

2865
02:22:12,140 --> 02:22:13,140
it all up.

2866
02:22:13,140 --> 02:22:16,620
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

2867
02:22:16,620 --> 02:22:17,620
Hey, this is X-Link.

2868
02:22:17,620 --> 02:22:19,860
Hey, X-Link, what's on your mind, buddy?

2869
02:22:19,860 --> 02:22:24,340
Hey, I'm glad to, I was reading Kotaku earlier on today and realized that they're coming

2870
02:22:24,340 --> 02:22:27,780
out with a new version of Blaster Master come tomorrow, everywhere.

2871
02:22:27,780 --> 02:22:30,020
I know, well, did you listen to Part A tonight?

2872
02:22:30,020 --> 02:22:36,940
We had a joygasm over it in Part A. Oh, did you, I'm sorry, I was having, we were having

2873
02:22:36,940 --> 02:22:37,940
some issues.

2874
02:22:37,940 --> 02:22:38,940
Yeah, we know, Super Bowl, blah, blah, blah.

2875
02:22:38,940 --> 02:22:42,660
No, no, no, no, nothing with Super Bowl at all, it was with the step-kids.

2876
02:22:42,660 --> 02:22:44,660
Alright, well, okay, fair enough.

2877
02:22:44,660 --> 02:22:47,300
What is on your mind, though, at least about the Blaster Master game, what are your thoughts

2878
02:22:47,300 --> 02:22:48,300
on it?

2879
02:22:48,300 --> 02:22:53,660
I'm going to think, I looked over the video they had out on YouTube and I, yeah, I gazzled

2880
02:22:53,660 --> 02:22:59,460
myself pretty much because this was one of the first games I got back when I had my NES

2881
02:22:59,460 --> 02:23:02,660
and I buy it with my own money and I absolutely loved it.

2882
02:23:02,660 --> 02:23:05,980
In fact, I had the World of Power book.

2883
02:23:05,980 --> 02:23:06,980
It was so good.

2884
02:23:06,980 --> 02:23:09,180
Oh, those novels by, like, FX9 and stuff?

2885
02:23:09,180 --> 02:23:10,180
Yes, yes, I have a bunch of them.

2886
02:23:10,180 --> 02:23:12,020
Fuck yes, I had that one, too.

2887
02:23:12,020 --> 02:23:13,700
And the Simon's Quest book, both were epic.

2888
02:23:13,700 --> 02:23:16,540
I think I had the Metal Gear one, too.

2889
02:23:16,540 --> 02:23:19,940
Yeah, I was missing this, too, because a lot of my books were burnt down, a lot of my old

2890
02:23:19,940 --> 02:23:25,820
school stuff for the games that I had, my PS1 games, a lot of those, I had back in my

2891
02:23:25,820 --> 02:23:32,420
mom's apartment when I was going from Orlando, Florida to Melbourne, Florida, a lot of stuff

2892
02:23:32,420 --> 02:23:33,420
got burnt down.

2893
02:23:33,420 --> 02:23:36,500
There was an arson in my mom's apartment and a lot of that stuff got burnt down, so I had

2894
02:23:36,500 --> 02:23:42,660
to go online and re-find the books, which, a lot of books I got, but the Simon's Quest

2895
02:23:42,660 --> 02:23:46,740
and the Metal Gear are, if you have them in good condition, are really valuable and really

2896
02:23:46,740 --> 02:23:47,740
hard to find.

2897
02:23:47,740 --> 02:23:50,060
A lot of the text, though, at least, is available online.

2898
02:23:50,060 --> 02:23:51,700
You can read a lot of those novels online.

2899
02:23:51,700 --> 02:23:52,700
Yeah.

2900
02:23:52,700 --> 02:23:56,460
Yeah, it's not the same thing, you know, collectors and all that, but I do, just, like, complete

2901
02:23:56,460 --> 02:23:59,460
random-ass fact about those books, and for those that don't know what we're talking about,

2902
02:23:59,460 --> 02:24:04,240
the World of Power were these books that they wrote about old NES games, but since a lot

2903
02:24:04,240 --> 02:24:08,340
of the 8-bit video games didn't really have stories that made for very good books, a lot

2904
02:24:08,340 --> 02:24:12,340
of times the authors would kind of add their own stuff to it, like, for instance, I believe

2905
02:24:12,340 --> 02:24:17,460
the plot about Castlevania 2 had to do with some kid, like, warping himself into that

2906
02:24:17,460 --> 02:24:18,460
world.

2907
02:24:18,460 --> 02:24:20,300
Like, it wasn't even really about Simon Belmont, but somebody-

2908
02:24:20,300 --> 02:24:21,620
To no end the Game Master.

2909
02:24:21,620 --> 02:24:22,620
Rip-off!

2910
02:24:22,620 --> 02:24:23,980
His little sidekick.

2911
02:24:23,980 --> 02:24:28,100
But there were some extra characters in Blaster Master to make that story work, too, and here's

2912
02:24:28,100 --> 02:24:29,300
the interesting thing.

2913
02:24:29,300 --> 02:24:33,700
I believe one of the characters was Eve, which was, I think, like, the name of the car or

2914
02:24:33,700 --> 02:24:35,900
something, or, like, was one of the robot characters.

2915
02:24:35,900 --> 02:24:41,740
They actually, the programmers of Blaster Master, made Eve, they wrote her into the

2916
02:24:41,740 --> 02:24:45,420
official canon, and she was in the Game Boy game.

2917
02:24:45,420 --> 02:24:47,700
And it's also from part two, from what I understand.

2918
02:24:47,700 --> 02:24:51,460
I believe there was an actual part two for Blaster Master, and they brought the actual

2919
02:24:51,460 --> 02:24:53,340
plot line from the book into the game.

2920
02:24:53,340 --> 02:24:57,620
I think that was kind of neat, so, because Blaster Master was one of the better books.

2921
02:24:57,620 --> 02:25:04,260
And also, the covers, a lot of times the covers were different from the actual game covers

2922
02:25:04,260 --> 02:25:05,260
from the video game.

2923
02:25:05,260 --> 02:25:08,980
That's right, because they took out, like, the gun from the Metal Gear cover, and they,

2924
02:25:08,980 --> 02:25:09,980
yeah, I remember that.

2925
02:25:09,980 --> 02:25:10,980
I remember that.

2926
02:25:10,980 --> 02:25:11,980
I remember that one.

2927
02:25:11,980 --> 02:25:12,980
Yeah, so.

2928
02:25:12,980 --> 02:25:15,580
But the kids' book, I mean, come on.

2929
02:25:15,580 --> 02:25:19,820
Good times down memory lane, good times.

2930
02:25:19,820 --> 02:25:22,740
They need to bring back those books, although I guess they do have them to some extent.

2931
02:25:22,740 --> 02:25:26,100
Like, there's books about Halo, tons of books about World of Warcraft.

2932
02:25:26,100 --> 02:25:28,300
Well, they're always bringing back, like, the Chijo Adventures.

2933
02:25:28,300 --> 02:25:29,580
I couldn't see why they couldn't do it.

2934
02:25:29,580 --> 02:25:34,980
I mean, you know, get the permission from the people and, you know, redo it, I mean.

2935
02:25:34,980 --> 02:25:37,740
All right.

2936
02:25:37,740 --> 02:25:40,900
But no, I was just mostly, I know you guys, you were looking for some calls, so it's called

2937
02:25:40,900 --> 02:25:41,900
about that.

2938
02:25:41,900 --> 02:25:44,620
And I was the guy really giddy about that, because I, you know, I had a lot of my old

2939
02:25:44,620 --> 02:25:47,780
school games, you know, like Blaster Master, you know, it was one of the first ones.

2940
02:25:47,780 --> 02:25:49,740
Of course, Castlevania was in there, I want to.

2941
02:25:49,740 --> 02:25:51,740
Castlevania II, I remember spending hours on it.

2942
02:25:51,740 --> 02:25:52,740
I'm giddy, too.

2943
02:25:52,740 --> 02:25:53,740
I wish it was on PS3.

2944
02:25:53,740 --> 02:25:58,860
Always burning out my friends, Nintendo, NES, because we had it on for 18 hours straight

2945
02:25:58,860 --> 02:26:01,180
because we didn't want to turn it off, and, you know, we wanted to go through and beat

2946
02:26:01,180 --> 02:26:03,780
the game, so.

2947
02:26:03,780 --> 02:26:08,180
I'm excited, but I'm trying very hard not to get too excited that I don't want to set

2948
02:26:08,180 --> 02:26:12,500
the expectations too high for this game, I'm just going to set the bar, like, somewhere

2949
02:26:12,500 --> 02:26:13,500
in the middle.

2950
02:26:13,500 --> 02:26:16,020
Because, you know, I don't want to get too excited and then be disappointed, you know

2951
02:26:16,020 --> 02:26:17,020
what I mean?

2952
02:26:17,020 --> 02:26:18,020
No, I hear you.

2953
02:26:18,020 --> 02:26:19,020
I hear you.

2954
02:26:19,020 --> 02:26:21,020
I'd be one of those things, like, you get all gung-ho about it, and it's like, ah, man,

2955
02:26:21,020 --> 02:26:22,820
when the heck did I do this in the first place?

2956
02:26:22,820 --> 02:26:23,820
Exactly.

2957
02:26:23,820 --> 02:26:26,340
All right, well, X-Link, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank

2958
02:26:26,340 --> 02:26:29,320
you so much for the call, and, you know what, actually, when you called, like, about two

2959
02:26:29,320 --> 02:26:32,500
other people called in at the same time, so you lucked out, so congrats.

2960
02:26:32,500 --> 02:26:33,500
No problem.

2961
02:26:33,500 --> 02:26:34,500
Thanks, man.

2962
02:26:34,500 --> 02:26:35,500
I appreciate it.

2963
02:26:35,500 --> 02:26:38,220
All right, that is going to do it for the Skypline tonight, and I apologize to those

2964
02:26:38,220 --> 02:26:42,780
folks that didn't get through, but if you do want to still interact with the show, remember,

2965
02:26:42,780 --> 02:26:47,900
we do take Twitter topics every week, we do take emails every week, you know what, any

2966
02:26:47,900 --> 02:26:51,460
way you can figure out on the internet on all of our various websites to contact us,

2967
02:26:51,460 --> 02:26:55,980
we will probably consider reading it on the show if you find us on one of those many,

2968
02:26:55,980 --> 02:26:56,980
many websites.

2969
02:26:56,980 --> 02:27:00,100
I'm going to go ahead and let Loki finish up any last minute stories he has while we

2970
02:27:00,100 --> 02:27:01,580
go ahead and shut down the Skypline.

2971
02:27:01,580 --> 02:27:03,620
This is kind of old news, I guess.

2972
02:27:03,620 --> 02:27:06,380
I've never heard of it, so I'm going to mention it.

2973
02:27:06,380 --> 02:27:13,220
Apparently there is a fan project, I guess an independent game, if you will, that is

2974
02:27:13,220 --> 02:27:24,740
called Terrordrome, and basically it's a fighting game featuring only horror movie characters.

2975
02:27:24,740 --> 02:27:26,860
I've not heard of this either, interesting.

2976
02:27:26,860 --> 02:27:36,860
So you've got Freddy, you've got Jason from the Friday the 13th movies, you actually have

2977
02:27:36,860 --> 02:27:44,260
Ash in there as well, Chucky, lots of cool characters, oh here's the full list, oh it's

2978
02:27:44,260 --> 02:27:49,260
under construction, thank you, but they do have a demo available online, I guess, that

2979
02:27:49,260 --> 02:27:57,860
you can download, it's awesome, and I'll have to check that out.

2980
02:27:57,860 --> 02:28:06,060
But if you want to check it out, it's at Terrordrome-thegame.com.

2981
02:28:06,060 --> 02:28:07,060
That's it.

2982
02:28:07,060 --> 02:28:08,060
Alright.

2983
02:28:08,060 --> 02:28:12,660
I had to link something in the chat room that has nothing to do with video games.

2984
02:28:12,660 --> 02:28:15,780
But you thought you'd link it anyway, it's all good, what is it?

2985
02:28:15,780 --> 02:28:18,580
Come have a look, it's actually this right here.

2986
02:28:18,580 --> 02:28:25,780
I'm a big type nerd, and I like that there's this garage where they actually manage to

2987
02:28:25,780 --> 02:28:30,660
get it, where if you're looking right from a certain angle, everything is perfectly aligned.

2988
02:28:30,660 --> 02:28:33,920
But as you go through, you see they've actually painted it all the way across.

2989
02:28:33,920 --> 02:28:37,020
That is pretty nerdy, I gotta say.

2990
02:28:37,020 --> 02:28:38,700
It's one of those optical illusions.

2991
02:28:38,700 --> 02:28:43,700
But also, when I look at games, I've actually been paying more attention to how they're

2992
02:28:43,700 --> 02:28:48,540
designed, you know, the look and feel of them, and I think that has a lot to do with that.

2993
02:28:48,540 --> 02:28:50,980
You know, you have to know your way around everything.

2994
02:28:50,980 --> 02:28:51,980
Alright.

2995
02:28:51,980 --> 02:28:55,980
Uh, Loki, I still see you playing on the YouTube there, did you get your thing fixed, or what

2996
02:28:55,980 --> 02:28:56,980
did you do?

2997
02:28:56,980 --> 02:28:59,660
Um, I argued saying that it was under fair use.

2998
02:28:59,660 --> 02:29:02,420
Oh, and it, the audio's back!

2999
02:29:02,420 --> 02:29:03,420
Nice.

3000
02:29:03,420 --> 02:29:07,460
Oh, look at that, see, arguing works.

3001
02:29:07,460 --> 02:29:09,260
I hope you don't get our account closed.

3002
02:29:09,260 --> 02:29:10,260
No, yeah.

3003
02:29:10,260 --> 02:29:15,380
So anyways, the new video that I posted online is now working, so if you want to go check

3004
02:29:15,380 --> 02:29:19,780
it out, please do it quickly, because I don't know how long they'll leave it up there.

3005
02:29:19,780 --> 02:29:23,060
And next week, next week we may not have an Orange Lounge Radio YouTube account, so enjoy

3006
02:29:23,060 --> 02:29:24,060
it while it lasts.

3007
02:29:24,060 --> 02:29:25,060
Who gives a crap?

3008
02:29:25,060 --> 02:29:26,060
We'll make a new one.

3009
02:29:26,060 --> 02:29:27,060
Alright.

3010
02:29:27,060 --> 02:29:28,060
But yes, check it out now!

3011
02:29:28,060 --> 02:29:29,060
Cool.

3012
02:29:29,060 --> 02:29:32,620
Uh, I have a quick last minute, sort of like, update.

3013
02:29:32,620 --> 02:29:38,940
Every year at Orange Lounge Radio, our friends over at Understation Live do their March Madness,

3014
02:29:38,940 --> 02:29:42,940
but now they call it, I think they just call it, uh, USL Madness, because it doesn't always

3015
02:29:42,940 --> 02:29:47,860
happen in March, but all the, you might remember a few weeks ago, we got some phone calls,

3016
02:29:47,860 --> 02:29:52,460
they were collecting the top 25 games, well they compiled that and they got the first

3017
02:29:52,460 --> 02:29:53,980
brackets up.

3018
02:29:53,980 --> 02:29:57,300
So some of the games are now doing battle, so if you want to check that out, go to Orange

3019
02:29:57,300 --> 02:30:02,100
Lounge Radio, and go to our forums, and you'll see there's a whole forum for March Madness,

3020
02:30:02,100 --> 02:30:05,300
and it says 2009 because we can't figure out how to update it, but it actually is all the

3021
02:30:05,300 --> 02:30:10,380
posts for 2010, and you can see all the brackets, and you can vote in the first round, but voting

3022
02:30:10,380 --> 02:30:12,860
closes tomorrow night, Monday night.

3023
02:30:12,860 --> 02:30:15,700
So you can choose, like, for instance, I'll read a few of these matchups that are going

3024
02:30:15,700 --> 02:30:22,900
on right now, Civilization versus Time Crisis, which is better, uh, Halo 2 versus Para Para

3025
02:30:22,900 --> 02:30:30,640
Paradise, Contra versus Final Fantasy X, and one of my favorites, Final Fantasy versus

3026
02:30:30,640 --> 02:30:34,480
Final Fantasy VIII, that's right, it just so happened the two Final Fantasies are doing

3027
02:30:34,480 --> 02:30:38,380
battle for each other, and when I voted Final Fantasy VIII was winning and I was pissed,

3028
02:30:38,380 --> 02:30:42,460
I was like, how can people vote for Craptacular VIII over the original?

3029
02:30:42,460 --> 02:30:46,380
I don't get it, but Final Fantasy I is currently winning and I feel much better.

3030
02:30:46,380 --> 02:30:49,100
So there you go, go check that out, but that's only going to be good till Monday night, so

3031
02:30:49,100 --> 02:30:53,940
if you're listening on the podcast, it might be too late, but you can go vote in the next

3032
02:30:53,940 --> 02:31:01,020
round and have your voice heard on what is truly the best video game of all time, according

3033
02:31:01,020 --> 02:31:03,100
to the OLR network.

3034
02:31:03,100 --> 02:31:06,780
Alright, um, that's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio, I know we're

3035
02:31:06,780 --> 02:31:10,420
done a little bit early tonight, but, um, that's the way it goes sometimes, sometimes

3036
02:31:10,420 --> 02:31:13,180
we have a lot to say, sometimes we don't have as much to say, so we're going to wrap it

3037
02:31:13,180 --> 02:31:15,940
all up and get on out of here for the night.

3038
02:31:15,940 --> 02:31:20,060
But first, we gotta go around and get everybody's final thought, and I'll start with my final

3039
02:31:20,060 --> 02:31:21,060
thought tonight.

3040
02:31:21,060 --> 02:31:24,420
My final thought is, I should, like, go to the arcade or something, play some arcade

3041
02:31:24,420 --> 02:31:25,420
games, that would be fun.

3042
02:31:25,420 --> 02:31:26,420
I haven't been in a while.

3043
02:31:26,420 --> 02:31:27,420
That sounds like fun.

3044
02:31:27,420 --> 02:31:28,420
It does sound like fun.

3045
02:31:28,420 --> 02:31:29,420
Maybe after moving.

3046
02:31:29,420 --> 02:31:30,940
Uh, DarkSakurai, your final thought?

3047
02:31:30,940 --> 02:31:32,860
Typography is life.

3048
02:31:32,860 --> 02:31:34,220
And Loki, your final thought?

3049
02:31:34,220 --> 02:31:38,300
It's really funny how- Your mic's off.

3050
02:31:38,300 --> 02:31:43,460
It's really funny how my mic was off, um, no, that, uh, just a simple little, uh, instructional

3051
02:31:43,460 --> 02:31:50,540
guide on eHow can get your YouTube video back up even though it has copyright music in it.

3052
02:31:50,540 --> 02:31:54,340
Let's hope it's there next week, we'll see, but, uh, one thing I hope to see next week

3053
02:31:54,340 --> 02:31:55,340
is all of you.

3054
02:31:55,340 --> 02:31:58,620
Uh, thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting.

3055
02:31:58,620 --> 02:32:02,780
Hey, if you like what you heard, all we ask, tell a couple friends about the show, tell

3056
02:32:02,780 --> 02:32:06,000
a couple enemies about the show if you want, just tell people about the show, help us with

3057
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,220
word of mouth because that is the only way we get to promote.

3058
02:32:08,220 --> 02:32:12,060
We don't have a multimillion dollar website or magazine or video game company behind us.

3059
02:32:12,060 --> 02:32:14,260
We are all about the independent word of mouth.

3060
02:32:14,260 --> 02:32:17,460
That's how we've been kept empowered over the past eight years that we've been doing

3061
02:32:17,460 --> 02:32:18,460
this show.

3062
02:32:18,460 --> 02:32:19,460
Whew.

3063
02:32:19,460 --> 02:32:21,260
All right, we'll be back to do it all again next week.

3064
02:32:21,260 --> 02:32:22,820
It is Valentine's Day.

3065
02:32:22,820 --> 02:32:24,660
Who knows what's going to happen next week.

3066
02:32:24,660 --> 02:32:25,660
So, uh, tune in.

3067
02:32:25,660 --> 02:32:29,460
Until then, uh, that does it for another week here at Orange Lounge Studios.

3068
02:32:29,460 --> 02:32:30,460
Have a great week.

3069
02:32:30,460 --> 02:32:37,460
We'll be back next Sunday for more of Orange Lounge Radio.

3070
02:33:00,460 --> 02:33:01,460
Right anyway.

3071
02:33:01,460 --> 02:33:30,460
See you next week.
