1
00:00:13,828 --> 00:00:18,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight, February 7th, 2010, a new Sonic the Hedgehog game is announced.

2
00:00:18,512 --> 00:00:21,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you soon get premium Warcraft features on your iPhone?

3
00:00:21,675 --> 00:00:24,137
[SPEAKER_07]: And what first-person shooter is coming to Facebook?

4
00:00:31,812 --> 00:00:32,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

5
00:00:47,467 --> 00:00:48,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, hi.

6
00:00:48,168 --> 00:00:53,010
[SPEAKER_04]: We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

7
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,251
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here with you every week.

8
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:55,292
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts.

9
00:00:55,432 --> 00:00:59,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Joining me as always, say hello to the lady shouting fail, fail over there in the corner.

10
00:01:00,575 --> 00:01:03,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Our very own fail blog here in house, DarkSakura.

11
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:04,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Fail!

12
00:01:04,437 --> 00:01:04,777
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?

13
00:01:05,836 --> 00:01:06,176
[SPEAKER_08]: I win.

14
00:01:27,216 --> 00:01:27,756
[SPEAKER_08]: I like cookies.

15
00:01:27,876 --> 00:01:30,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so tonight he is Cookie Master Loki.

16
00:01:30,318 --> 00:01:32,939
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm sure he'll talk about tech here and there as well.

17
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:36,240
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, you've been kind of over there hammering on YouTube, right?

18
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,561
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on over there on YouTube, Loki?

19
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:43,104
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they just uploaded my new video and disabled all the audio because they're awesome like that.

20
00:01:43,764 --> 00:01:44,264
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened?

21
00:01:44,284 --> 00:01:45,505
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you use copyright music?

22
00:01:45,545 --> 00:01:46,365
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, copyright.

23
00:01:46,445 --> 00:01:48,987
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's tons of videos out there that have copyright music in them.

24
00:01:49,147 --> 00:01:49,607
[SPEAKER_11]: That's lame.

25
00:01:49,867 --> 00:01:50,367
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry to hear that.

26
00:01:50,387 --> 00:01:50,668
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all right.

27
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:53,109
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll find someplace else to upload it because YouTube sucks.

28
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:53,529
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

29
00:01:53,917 --> 00:01:54,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Daddy playin' the game!

30
00:02:20,205 --> 00:02:21,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

31
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,171
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

32
00:03:00,495 --> 00:03:02,015
[SPEAKER_09]: I played a crap ton of Star Trek online.

33
00:03:03,036 --> 00:03:11,218
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I realized when I decided to go on the quest to find Deep Space Nine that my little character had been just running around the promenade for about an hour and a half.

34
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:12,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Just running around.

35
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:14,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Doing nothing.

36
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:15,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Running around.

37
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,460
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's about it.

38
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:19,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Except for some solitaire.

39
00:03:21,377 --> 00:03:23,338
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been playing actual solitaire on the computer?

40
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:24,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, on the iPhone.

41
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:27,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, do they even include solitaire on the computer anymore?

42
00:03:27,901 --> 00:03:28,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's included.

43
00:03:28,962 --> 00:03:30,102
[SPEAKER_09]: That and Spider Solitaire.

44
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:30,763
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't really looked.

45
00:03:31,923 --> 00:03:33,945
[SPEAKER_09]: A few others, Hearts and Freestyle and all that crap.

46
00:03:34,145 --> 00:03:34,405
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

47
00:03:35,886 --> 00:03:36,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

48
00:03:37,947 --> 00:03:38,567
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty good.

49
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:41,909
[SPEAKER_11]: I played more Borderlands and...

50
00:03:43,755 --> 00:03:45,016
[SPEAKER_11]: That's still entertaining me.

51
00:03:46,237 --> 00:03:47,038
[SPEAKER_11]: More Grand Theft Auto.

52
00:03:47,618 --> 00:03:48,399
[SPEAKER_11]: Finally made it.

53
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,664
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm in the top 100 players now for true skill rankings.

54
00:03:53,884 --> 00:03:55,886
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm in like the mid 90s now for that.

55
00:03:55,966 --> 00:03:56,687
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty awesome.

56
00:03:57,447 --> 00:04:02,752
[SPEAKER_11]: And working my way up just the cumulative ranked deathmatch stats.

57
00:04:03,312 --> 00:04:04,774
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think I'm

58
00:04:05,765 --> 00:04:07,866
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, it varies depending on how much I play it.

59
00:04:08,626 --> 00:04:11,667
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I'm around 230 something right now.

60
00:04:13,228 --> 00:04:17,950
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I purchased Bioshock 2, so I played a little bit of that.

61
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,890
[SPEAKER_11]: And that one's actually pretty cool.

62
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Very similar, obviously, to the first game.

63
00:04:22,311 --> 00:04:22,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, wait a minute.

64
00:04:22,771 --> 00:04:25,472
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought Bioshock 2 wasn't out until Tuesday, but you have the hookup, right?

65
00:04:25,613 --> 00:04:28,254
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not out until Tuesday, but it's pretty awesome.

66
00:04:30,481 --> 00:04:35,063
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, definitely worth checking out, especially if you like the first game.

67
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:41,346
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems like there's going to be a lot of similarities between this game and the last one, but so far I'm digging it.

68
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:42,967
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

69
00:04:42,987 --> 00:04:44,207
[SPEAKER_12]: Do they have multiplayer in this one?

70
00:04:44,347 --> 00:04:44,867
[SPEAKER_12]: They do, yes.

71
00:04:45,027 --> 00:04:46,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, fun.

72
00:04:46,608 --> 00:04:52,291
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be the big kicker right there, because that was one kind of glaring omission in the first one, and what a lot of people were clamoring for.

73
00:04:52,371 --> 00:04:54,692
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's probably the whole sale of the game right there.

74
00:04:54,992 --> 00:04:57,173
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if I'll even play the multiplayer, though.

75
00:04:58,013 --> 00:04:59,894
[SPEAKER_11]: It just doesn't seem like anything I'd be interested in.

76
00:05:00,512 --> 00:05:00,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

77
00:05:00,973 --> 00:05:04,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever I play those multiplayer shooting games, I get raped in the face, and that's not a lot of fun.

78
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,822
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, not necessarily that.

79
00:05:05,842 --> 00:05:08,447
[SPEAKER_11]: It just seems like tacked on or something, but whatever.

80
00:05:09,915 --> 00:05:10,295
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's it.

81
00:05:10,955 --> 00:05:11,275
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

82
00:05:11,975 --> 00:05:12,516
[SPEAKER_04]: My Gaming Week.

83
00:05:12,536 --> 00:05:13,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of the same old stuff.

84
00:05:13,536 --> 00:05:17,356
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing more Bayonetta and World of Warcraft and some of those games.

85
00:05:17,797 --> 00:05:22,257
[SPEAKER_04]: The only new game I really checked out this week was one of the new Xbox Live Arcade games that they have called Chime.

86
00:05:23,078 --> 00:05:26,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody on Twitter had posted, hey, if you like Luminous, you should play Chime.

87
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:30,659
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I could definitely see where somebody is making the comparisons between Chime and Luminous.

88
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:32,259
[SPEAKER_04]: They're both puzzle games.

89
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,700
[SPEAKER_04]: They're both heavily involved with music.

90
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:42,544
[SPEAKER_04]: They both have a beat line that sweeps across the screen and they have very similar looking screens, might I say, that affects the gameplay.

91
00:05:42,584 --> 00:05:48,007
[SPEAKER_04]: But where the games get very different is that, you know, you could say Luminous is somewhat of a Tetris inspired game.

92
00:05:48,527 --> 00:05:52,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Chime is like, I'm going to get really old school here and I bet half the listeners don't even know what I'm talking about.

93
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Chime is like Dedalion Opus on the Game Boy.

94
00:05:55,992 --> 00:05:57,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone ever played Dedalion Opus?

95
00:05:59,114 --> 00:06:00,375
[SPEAKER_08]: A while back.

96
00:06:00,435 --> 00:06:03,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's one of these games here, since you probably haven't played it.

97
00:06:03,577 --> 00:06:04,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what it is.

98
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:08,702
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically like you have all these shapes that you're trying to put in.

99
00:06:08,722 --> 00:06:11,864
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're all square based, but they might be in an L shape or a jagged shape.

100
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:15,808
[SPEAKER_04]: And don't think just Tetris pieces, because sometimes they're like five or six blocks in a row.

101
00:06:16,888 --> 00:06:22,653
[SPEAKER_04]: And you try to fit them into this square or some other type of geometric shape.

102
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:23,034
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

103
00:06:23,054 --> 00:06:24,475
[SPEAKER_04]: I think maybe like tangrams.

104
00:06:25,055 --> 00:06:28,357
[SPEAKER_04]: But all based around Tetris style shapes, if that makes any sense at all.

105
00:06:28,397 --> 00:06:28,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

106
00:06:28,977 --> 00:06:29,998
[SPEAKER_04]: You try to kind of fit them in there.

107
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:39,663
[SPEAKER_04]: So Chime is about trying to make 3x3 squares as fast as you can out of these odd shapes, which it's a little harder than it sounds.

108
00:06:41,064 --> 00:06:42,765
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

109
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:09,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Ray Iannami in our chatroom, chat.orangelunchradio.com, Tetrominos, I think it's called.

110
00:07:09,121 --> 00:07:09,881
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's it.

111
00:07:09,981 --> 00:07:10,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, what you're talking about there.

112
00:07:11,022 --> 00:07:11,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Same kind of idea.

113
00:07:12,942 --> 00:07:18,663
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, here's the thing is that as you build these blocks, your multiplier goes up the faster you build them.

114
00:07:18,723 --> 00:07:22,844
[SPEAKER_04]: And oddly enough, yeah, it enhances the music as you build.

115
00:07:23,604 --> 00:07:27,025
[SPEAKER_04]: There are songs by Moby, one of the guys from Orbital.

116
00:07:27,805 --> 00:07:57,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Phillip Glass has a song in there which I thought was totally random so there's some actually some big name talent in the game probably only about five songs in the game but it's only a five dollar game and I don't know maybe there will be expansions later but anyhow the beat sweeper will kind of sweep out your crap if you leave it behind too long like if you've let these isolated pieces that didn't get formed into blocks the beat sweeper will filter them out after it gets hit maybe like five times and then they all flush out and you lose your multiplier multiplier

117
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,782
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's good for cleaning up the board, but it's bad for your score.

118
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:04,923
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the gist of Chime.

119
00:08:05,643 --> 00:08:07,323
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually kind of a neat little puzzler.

120
00:08:08,004 --> 00:08:14,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was kind of cool, and the music was very trancy, zony, but I thought it was decent for a game like that.

121
00:08:14,886 --> 00:08:18,047
[SPEAKER_04]: And best of all, it's only $5, even though it's only five songs.

122
00:08:18,407 --> 00:08:22,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Now here's the thing, is that the game is supposed to go for charity.

123
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:26,310
[SPEAKER_04]: They really advertise heavily in the game that 60% of the purchase price...

124
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:30,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to these various children's charities and you can go online and look.

125
00:08:30,713 --> 00:08:38,598
[SPEAKER_04]: What I thought was a little weird though is that they actually as part of the sales pitch of the game say, buy this game and feel good about supporting charities.

126
00:08:38,838 --> 00:08:42,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and you get 50 gamer score just for buying the game.

127
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:48,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's an achievement that is called something like, and I'm paraphrasing here, feel good about yourself.

128
00:08:49,285 --> 00:08:49,966
[SPEAKER_04]: 50 gamer score.

129
00:08:50,026 --> 00:08:52,527
[SPEAKER_04]: You can feel good about yourself and the purchase you've made of this game.

130
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:56,190
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just gives you basically 50 gamer score for I guess going to the title screen.

131
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,191
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was a little weird.

132
00:08:58,411 --> 00:08:59,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, I get it.

133
00:09:00,052 --> 00:09:00,933
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for charity.

134
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:01,854
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good thing.

135
00:09:02,854 --> 00:09:07,217
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're essentially buying gamerscore, if you think about it that way.

136
00:09:07,258 --> 00:09:17,485
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not that I necessarily have a problem with that, with the charity angle, but the fact that it's kind of marketed like that is a little, I don't want to say off-putting, but that's the best word I can think of.

137
00:09:17,845 --> 00:09:21,988
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say, though, that it's more like just a little way of saying thank you for your donation.

138
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:22,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

139
00:09:23,627 --> 00:09:26,789
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that badge should be worth zero gamerscore if that's the case.

140
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:33,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I'm okay with there being like a little badge of pride like, yay, have your warm fuzzies for buying our charity game.

141
00:09:33,633 --> 00:09:40,757
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't think it should be worth any gamerscore and I don't think they should be advertising like, hey, if you buy this game, we'll give you 50 gamerscore just for getting it.

142
00:09:41,197 --> 00:09:41,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know.

143
00:09:41,757 --> 00:09:42,738
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, that just kind of...

144
00:09:44,464 --> 00:09:47,569
[SPEAKER_04]: It just seems like it opens the floodgates to all this kind of like devious behavior.

145
00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:51,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I understand it's for charity and maybe like Microsoft kind of let him get away with that for all that.

146
00:09:52,195 --> 00:09:53,577
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not trying to like knock the game.

147
00:09:53,717 --> 00:09:59,585
[SPEAKER_04]: It just, when I kind of looked at that, I kind of made one of those raised eyebrow faces of that ain't right.

148
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:01,207
[SPEAKER_04]: That ain't right.

149
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:03,249
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

150
00:10:20,126 --> 00:10:24,708
[SPEAKER_04]: I think for just like a good little chill out game, five bucks is not asking too much.

151
00:10:24,908 --> 00:10:33,150
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, despite my little issue with the 50 gamer score for free, it is a feel good thing that you can do like, hey, I bought this game and the money's going to charity.

152
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:33,911
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty cool.

153
00:10:34,491 --> 00:10:34,591
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

154
00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:38,875
[SPEAKER_04]: That was pretty much my gaming week, all things considered.

155
00:10:38,935 --> 00:10:41,457
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are pretty much the games I was playing.

156
00:10:41,738 --> 00:10:42,719
[SPEAKER_04]: How about you guys in chat?

157
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:43,699
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your gaming week?

158
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Some guys in chat kind of talking about the charity thing I was just talking about.

159
00:10:48,163 --> 00:10:56,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com Kevin DDR in chat says, Only thing that irritated me was the different choice of pieces on different songs.

160
00:10:56,651 --> 00:11:00,034
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that something that fundamental to the gameplay strategy would stay consistent.

161
00:11:00,454 --> 00:11:00,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

162
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:08,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Kevin DDR also said, I assumed achievements generally got the amount of points based on the relative difficulty of the achievement.

163
00:11:08,442 --> 00:11:10,925
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess, unfortunately, some developers don't want to do that.

164
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:16,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good point, because that 50 gamerscore achievement is like the biggest one in that game, because they only have 200 to work with.

165
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:22,677
[SPEAKER_04]: And the rest of the achievements are, some of them are fairly difficult, at least from the little bit I played.

166
00:11:23,297 --> 00:11:23,397
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

167
00:11:24,358 --> 00:11:24,738
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

168
00:11:24,758 --> 00:11:28,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Some comments from chat.orangeloungeradio.com Some housekeeping tonight.

178
00:11:57,888 --> 00:11:58,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

179
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:46,193
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to thank the community at AllGames.com www.AllGames.com It's All Games Radio and it's the place where we do tape our show live every Sunday night and as I always say on the show if you don't like what you hear from us maybe one of the other shows on the network is more your cup of tea because as mentioned before, I think Jamie mentioned everybody she knows is playing Mass Effect 2 but we're all sitting here going, well we just really haven't been playing that because I've been too busy playing Bayonetta and Raiding and DarkSakura's been too busy playing Star Trek Online and

180
00:12:46,573 --> 00:13:11,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Shooting Klingons But I'm sure there's lots of other shows where they're talking about Mass Effect 2 non-stop So if that's more your cup of tea, hey, cool But if you do like our show, one last little plug Please visit iTunes, search for Orange Launch Radio And leave us a nice little review iTunes, by the way, recently changed the podcast page format To kind of match the rest of the CDs and things in the marketplace So if you go visit Orange Launch Radio You can see the most popular shows in our feed and so forth Although...

181
00:13:11,912 --> 00:13:41,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a little early to really be tracking those type of statistics but I thought it was neat you can see the little cover arts of the shows that it suggests like people who listen to Orange Lounge Radio also like and it shows all the little cover art you know who the number one show is that suggested people who also listen to Orange Lounge Radio also like you know what the number one show is in the list any guesses do tell Bobby Blackwolf our good pal Bobby is the number one suggestion of course he is because you know we're on right back to back on all games radio I'm sure we're number one on his list too

182
00:13:41,932 --> 00:14:04,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, also getting information from our chatroom, www.orangelantradio.com, click on chat or you can go to chat.orangelantradio.com TigerClaw says, hey this just in, Dante's Inferno ad just played during the fourth quarter, because they're watching the Super Bowl right now With the tagline, Hell Awaits, which if I remember right, wasn't there some controversy that they weren't going to air that promo?

183
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,614
[SPEAKER_11]: They just made them edit it so it wasn't saying go to hell

184
00:14:07,294 --> 00:14:30,354
[SPEAKER_04]: I see, that's right, it was gonna say go to hell, now it's hell awaits Who cares, it doesn't matter A little weird I did play the demo for that game, it was neat It was kind of God of War-ish, but fun Yeah So, not that, I mean, being God of War is not a bad thing Alright, let's get into some gaming news Lots of gaming news this week, surprisingly enough We're really starting to kind of kick into the year And all the game news, and Loki's starting us off with some big news, right?

185
00:14:30,374 --> 00:14:30,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep

186
00:14:30,934 --> 00:14:34,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, this is, I don't know if it's completely big news.

187
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,985
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, kind of, we could have figured this out pretty simple.

188
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:43,132
[SPEAKER_11]: Project Needlemouse, you know, the project that they were working on that was a 2D Sonic game.

189
00:14:43,753 --> 00:14:44,354
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, guess what?

190
00:14:44,434 --> 00:14:45,455
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Sonic 4.

191
00:14:45,896 --> 00:14:46,637
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my God.

192
00:14:47,418 --> 00:14:49,539
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a surprise, except it's not.

193
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:58,181
[SPEAKER_11]: What is kind of unique about it is it's going to be available only as an episodic game, and it's available on all the different download services.

194
00:14:58,321 --> 00:15:00,782
[SPEAKER_11]: We wear PlayStation Network, Xbox Live.

195
00:15:02,822 --> 00:15:04,382
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's kind of cool.

196
00:15:05,043 --> 00:15:11,324
[SPEAKER_11]: And I guess the first episode will be available this summer, and hopefully it's good.

197
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:12,465
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

198
00:15:14,145 --> 00:15:16,105
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just not that excited about it, that's all.

199
00:15:16,765 --> 00:15:22,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it because maybe there hasn't been like a really, really like OMG, squee in my pants, exciting Sonic game?

200
00:15:22,747 --> 00:15:27,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, because they always say, oh, we're gonna do what people wanted us to do, and then they fuck it up somehow.

201
00:15:28,087 --> 00:15:31,188
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's... I don't know.

202
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Some comments in our chat seem to agree.

203
00:15:32,868 --> 00:15:35,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Ray Ayanami says, can Sega not fuck up Sonic 4?

204
00:15:38,969 --> 00:15:40,850
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, I know you're a big Sonic fan girl.

205
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,050
[SPEAKER_04]: What was your reaction to the trailer?

206
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:42,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Squee.

207
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,541
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna take a cookie.

208
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:49,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you better eat that last cookie before I do.

209
00:15:51,003 --> 00:15:52,544
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's, no, no, no, I don't need any more cookies.

210
00:15:52,604 --> 00:16:06,993
[SPEAKER_04]: But here, I have to admit, even though the trailer didn't show much, I mean, it just kind of showed the whole idea of, hey, we're making a new Sonic game in the original Genesis game canon, which we haven't touched in, what, 15 years, I think?

211
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,434
[SPEAKER_04]: So, maybe longer than that, I don't know.

212
00:16:09,574 --> 00:16:10,635
[SPEAKER_08]: But it is the updated model.

213
00:16:10,655 --> 00:16:10,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

214
00:16:11,155 --> 00:16:35,506
[SPEAKER_04]: right and what I thought was interesting is that you know the little glimpse of gameplay you see was a very Sonic 3 corkscrew looking thing that just looked very souped up in 3D like it's interesting Mega Man 9 has sort of opened the floodgates to this kind of stuff in a way I don't know do you think this was inspired by the success of Mega Man 9 or do you think Sega's just finally getting the hint people just want the old shit with new a new coat of paint or what

215
00:16:36,249 --> 00:16:40,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I've noticed, and this is almost with any type of genre, be it art, music, whatever.

216
00:16:41,854 --> 00:16:50,141
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of times you get this going towards the bigger, the better, the whole, you know, brand new, shiny, 3D, whatever, digital.

217
00:16:51,502 --> 00:16:55,946
[SPEAKER_09]: But there comes a phase in everything that you go back to the old way of doing.

218
00:16:56,587 --> 00:17:00,030
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you want the classic look, you want the classic play.

219
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:04,554
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, else we wouldn't have, you know, Sonic 4, we wouldn't have the new Mega Man games.

220
00:17:05,785 --> 00:17:08,549
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, shoot, even art's done the same thing.

221
00:17:08,629 --> 00:17:16,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Like right after the Victorian age, you know, we, well, kind of around the same time, there were people that were going back to the old handmade way of doing things.

222
00:17:16,762 --> 00:17:18,805
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's just culture.

223
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:19,887
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to happen.

224
00:17:19,927 --> 00:17:20,608
[SPEAKER_09]: It was bound to happen.

225
00:17:21,092 --> 00:17:22,713
[SPEAKER_04]: History repeats itself kind of thing.

226
00:17:22,953 --> 00:17:23,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

227
00:17:24,054 --> 00:17:24,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Some comments in chat.

228
00:17:24,854 --> 00:17:27,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Hitstun says, Well, Sega did a great job with OutRun 2.

229
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:27,956
[SPEAKER_04]: There is hope.

230
00:17:29,037 --> 00:17:32,519
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if we're thinking of the same game here, but there was an OutRun game.

231
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,402
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it was OutRun 2, but there was an OutRun game on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.

232
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, OutRun 2000.

233
00:17:37,562 --> 00:17:37,862
[SPEAKER_04]: That was it.

234
00:17:38,723 --> 00:17:39,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that long ago.

235
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:40,784
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was kind of cool.

236
00:17:41,124 --> 00:17:41,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Like for a...

237
00:17:42,345 --> 00:17:43,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan played the crap out of it.

238
00:17:43,686 --> 00:17:49,628
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't like OMG best game ever, but for a little arcade racing game that kind of invoked the old style of OutRun, I enjoyed it.

239
00:17:49,948 --> 00:17:52,329
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I did buy the full version and played it a little bit.

240
00:17:52,349 --> 00:17:52,729
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fun.

241
00:17:52,749 --> 00:17:55,070
[SPEAKER_08]: It had Magical Sound Shower and that's the important thing.

242
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:55,450
[SPEAKER_04]: It sure did.

243
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,610
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Magical Sound Shower.

244
00:17:57,351 --> 00:17:57,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

245
00:17:58,191 --> 00:17:59,471
[SPEAKER_04]: And some other comments in chat room.

246
00:17:59,832 --> 00:18:02,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Frisbee says, I think this is Sega's final try.

247
00:18:03,593 --> 00:18:04,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting comment.

248
00:18:04,473 --> 00:18:08,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that if this doesn't live up to the hype that Sonic's done?

249
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:10,115
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a done franchise?

250
00:18:11,116 --> 00:18:11,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Bury it?

251
00:18:13,024 --> 00:18:14,245
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Sonic isn't going to die.

252
00:18:14,865 --> 00:18:16,086
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't think Sonic would die either.

253
00:18:16,567 --> 00:18:20,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Something to think about, even if Sonic 4 tanks, which I highly doubt it will.

254
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:23,251
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're doing the right thing in invoking the past here.

255
00:18:23,992 --> 00:18:27,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if, for whatever crazy ass reason, Sonic 4 tanks.

256
00:18:27,334 --> 00:18:33,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's not forget, Mario and Sonic at the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics and all that stuff was huge on the Nintendo Wii.

257
00:18:33,818 --> 00:18:37,921
[SPEAKER_04]: So Sonic as a character I think still has a lot of kind of clout, if you will.

258
00:18:38,422 --> 00:18:38,902
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that

259
00:18:39,382 --> 00:18:47,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Oddly enough, if Sonic 4 were to tank, which again, I don't think it will Sonic would mainly exist in Nintendo franchises Isn't that weird?

260
00:18:49,278 --> 00:18:52,400
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's just the way things are going

261
00:19:19,511 --> 00:19:25,234
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to suck for them because now, since they're not putting out a full retail version, I'm assuming it's going to be cheaper.

262
00:19:25,994 --> 00:19:29,836
[SPEAKER_11]: And if people really hate the game, they're not out as much money.

263
00:19:30,696 --> 00:19:33,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is good for the consumer, bad for Sega.

264
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:44,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think maybe they're just doing this so that by the time they put out Episode 1, Episode 2, Episode 3, they make about as much money as they would have if they just put the game out on DVD, Blu-ray?

265
00:19:44,288 --> 00:19:47,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much, but that's assuming if everybody buys all the parts to it.

266
00:19:48,672 --> 00:19:49,473
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's a good point.

267
00:19:50,253 --> 00:19:52,635
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, chat.orangehauntsradio.com if you want to comment on this.

268
00:19:52,655 --> 00:19:54,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Was there anything else for this story, Loki, you wanted to add?

269
00:19:55,553 --> 00:20:02,518
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, yeah, I was also going to say that, um, one other platform that it's supposed to be coming out on is the iPhone.

270
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:05,661
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's kind of typical with anything nowadays.

271
00:20:06,101 --> 00:20:08,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, I'm going to assume that this is on the iPhone is going to control like shit.

272
00:20:10,097 --> 00:20:10,877
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just my guess.

273
00:20:11,097 --> 00:20:18,460
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a little weird that it's coming to the iPhone because, you know, I'm not a big fan of all these games getting adapted to the iPhone because the touch thing is a little weird.

274
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:22,001
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I don't know.

275
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:32,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Some comments, more comments from our chat room, chat.orangelounge.com Tiger Claw says, the fact that the game is episodic probably means you will have your epic boss battle against Doc Robotnik.

276
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:33,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't that a given?

277
00:20:33,045 --> 00:20:37,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Like at the end of every stage you always have to have your, you know, Doc Robotnik battle at the end?

278
00:20:38,006 --> 00:20:38,987
[SPEAKER_04]: That's every stage, right?

279
00:20:40,382 --> 00:20:42,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, TigerClaw says, actually, he's correcting that.

280
00:20:42,263 --> 00:20:45,183
[SPEAKER_04]: You will not have your epic boss battle against Doc Robotnik.

281
00:20:45,524 --> 00:20:49,485
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe that, like, you have, like, mini-bosses.

282
00:20:49,585 --> 00:20:50,505
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how that would work.

283
00:20:52,326 --> 00:20:54,986
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Matt says, it should have Michael Jackson music in it.

284
00:20:55,326 --> 00:21:01,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know if that's going to be very possible at this point, unless they were working in secret, you know, more than a year ago.

285
00:21:01,948 --> 00:21:03,449
[SPEAKER_04]: But I somehow doubt that is the case.

286
00:21:05,034 --> 00:21:09,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think all of us in studio kind of agree, though, we will pick up Sonic 4, at least check it out.

287
00:21:10,377 --> 00:21:14,340
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I will, because I do love the old Sonic games, and I'm all about checking out the new one.

288
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,881
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure, I know Jamie's gonna buy it, I don't even have to ask her.

289
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:17,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

290
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:19,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt, will you buy it?

291
00:21:20,043 --> 00:21:20,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

292
00:21:21,764 --> 00:21:22,184
[SPEAKER_11]: One holdout.

293
00:21:22,204 --> 00:21:23,445
[SPEAKER_11]: Why not, dare I ask?

294
00:21:24,445 --> 00:21:27,447
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I haven't bought any of the Sonic games, I just don't care.

295
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:28,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

296
00:21:29,308 --> 00:21:31,530
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not really a game that I really got into.

297
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe Loki will care about this.

298
00:21:34,632 --> 00:21:39,357
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I sure did, because I let out the biggest fangirl scream when I saw this.

299
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:40,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, seriously, I'm not even joking.

300
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:42,320
[SPEAKER_04]: When I saw this last week.

301
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk about out of right field.

302
00:21:44,181 --> 00:21:45,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, this came out of nowhere.

303
00:21:46,424 --> 00:21:53,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Sunsoft, remember they reformed not that long ago, announced that Blaster Master Overdrive is on its way out.

304
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:57,434
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, a remade new version of Blaster Master, although...

305
00:21:57,934 --> 00:22:00,196
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not believe this is like a remake.

306
00:22:00,357 --> 00:22:03,259
[SPEAKER_04]: It is actually a sequel of the NES classic.

307
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:07,703
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just kind of forgetting that, you know, Blaster Master 2 on Genesis and the Game Boy One never happened.

308
00:22:08,004 --> 00:22:14,349
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is the sequel to Blaster Master will be coming out on WiiWare for 1,000 Wii points.

309
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:17,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what I think is the biggest twist out of this whole thing.

310
00:22:18,053 --> 00:22:20,935
[SPEAKER_04]: They said, oh yeah, and the game, it's coming out Monday.

311
00:22:20,955 --> 00:22:21,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

312
00:22:21,756 --> 00:22:50,346
[SPEAKER_04]: as in tomorrow as in we've kept this a secret for however long we've been working on this and hey now it's out now you can buy it and there's even a little trailer out there that shows some of the gameplay I'm playing a little bit of it in studio because great awesome enough it has a remixed version of the theme I don't like the remix version of the theme they kind of like fucked it up you know what nothing is ever going to be as good as the original that's really what it is I don't like this one at all but this is not bad it could have been a lot worse

313
00:22:52,964 --> 00:22:54,444
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can definitely see it's 16x9.

314
00:22:55,065 --> 00:22:57,265
[SPEAKER_04]: The overhead stages look a lot different.

315
00:22:59,266 --> 00:23:04,948
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, this game just kind of has more of a Metroid look to it, which I'm all over that.

316
00:23:06,288 --> 00:23:06,968
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty sweet.

317
00:23:07,568 --> 00:23:15,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's like some of these overhead levels have ice themes and more cavern themes, whereas I don't remember that being the case in the first one.

318
00:23:20,935 --> 00:23:21,676
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

319
00:23:44,557 --> 00:23:50,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, maybe, they'll probably be up Dan's alley Now, Loki, which would you rather play, Sonic 4 or Blaster Master Overdrive?

320
00:23:50,806 --> 00:23:56,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Blaster Master Oh, okay I had to ask, I had to DarkSakura, what do you got?

321
00:23:56,758 --> 00:23:58,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it was bound to happen.

322
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,084
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that it was expected maybe sooner rather than now.

323
00:24:02,544 --> 00:24:07,569
[SPEAKER_09]: But Xbox Live is going to be canceling out support for the original console.

324
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:10,192
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's going into effect on April 15th.

325
00:24:10,913 --> 00:24:18,240
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's also not just the console, but for games that are compatible with both the 360 and the old Xbox.

326
00:24:18,941 --> 00:24:19,141
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

327
00:24:21,129 --> 00:24:31,168
[SPEAKER_09]: and basically saying that because more people now are really on Xbox 360 that that's what they want to focus their power on and cut the support so they can focus more fully on the newer system.

328
00:24:32,864 --> 00:24:33,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Halo 2 Halo 3 Halo 2

329
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:06,341
[SPEAKER_09]: well they're saying also that the other big thing is that the changes that they want to make to the service are as I say incompatible with the original games with the old games

330
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:07,292
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

331
00:25:31,332 --> 00:25:58,682
[SPEAKER_04]: so that's one of the big things that getting rid of the original Xbox games and shutting down Halo 2 and so forth will free up and I would say by the end of the year probably whenever the patch comes out for Natal your friends list is going to get a big bump and you'll be able to have 250, 500, maybe even unlimited friends I don't know and I'm sure there are some other technical components that we're just not aware of because we haven't thought of them yet but there's some other things that they have to shut off these games for

332
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:20,502
[SPEAKER_04]: but on the flip side there's a lot of as you can understand ticked off people still playing the original Xbox still playing Halo 2 haven't upgraded Xbox 360 yet that are very sad about this news what do you guys think too bad so sad it's time to give it up and put it away or do they do they make a case maybe Microsoft needs to find a way to still support this

333
00:26:21,222 --> 00:26:21,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Who cares?

334
00:26:22,763 --> 00:26:25,405
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, seriously, how many people are still playing the original Xbox?

335
00:26:25,725 --> 00:26:27,086
[SPEAKER_11]: Upgrade, get a new system.

336
00:26:27,146 --> 00:26:30,409
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's bound to happen that they're going to shut off servers.

337
00:26:30,469 --> 00:26:35,752
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, just because you're paying for it now, okay, great, that you're paying for it month to month.

338
00:26:35,973 --> 00:26:37,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, now you're not.

339
00:26:38,334 --> 00:26:40,456
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I don't know.

340
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:42,577
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really feel sad about these people.

341
00:26:43,718 --> 00:27:11,770
[SPEAKER_04]: I do find it strange okay the original Xbox games couldn't be patched or whatever I get that but I do find it strange that Microsoft won't find a way to still let Halo 2 be playable on the 360 you know what I mean like via a patch or via you know because Halo 2 is an on-demand game it's a download game so that you could fix it so that you could still play it on Xbox 360 at least you know fix whatever is the problem with the friends list and play it that way you would think they would do that but they're not

342
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:37,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Tiger Claw does bring up a good point though in our chat room, chat.orangelawntrader.com People can still play Halo 2 multiplayer if they get the PC version So, you know, Halo 2 is not forgotten for everybody Let's see, Hitstun in our chat says if you have an original Xbox and it's not modded, it's time to mod it And that also makes me think of the fact that, you know, you could also go the way of the original Halo And if you really want to play your Halo 2 or your Halo, it's time to break out the LAN party

343
00:27:38,973 --> 00:27:40,055
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we still do that sometimes.

344
00:27:40,475 --> 00:27:40,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah?

345
00:27:40,896 --> 00:27:43,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we would have the TVs all over the house.

346
00:27:44,141 --> 00:27:45,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I'll tell you what's funny.

347
00:27:45,382 --> 00:27:53,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan's bachelor party was really a bunch of people over playing all the systems all land.

348
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:58,070
[SPEAKER_04]: GameGuru in chat is correcting me that Halo 2 isn't a game on demand.

349
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:58,470
[SPEAKER_04]: My bad.

350
00:27:58,790 --> 00:27:59,832
[SPEAKER_04]: I assumed that it was.

351
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,834
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess Halo 1 is, but not Halo 2.

352
00:28:02,675 --> 00:28:03,036
[SPEAKER_04]: My bad.

353
00:28:04,177 --> 00:28:10,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, okay, but let me just say to that then, okay, make it a game on demand and make it so that it works.

354
00:28:10,325 --> 00:28:11,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Seems a little strange to me.

355
00:28:12,027 --> 00:28:38,872
[SPEAKER_04]: X-Link in our chatroom says EA does it all the time That's true, EA shuts down servers for old games And we kind of go, well, they're old There's new versions of the game out And sure enough, there is Halo 3 and Halo ODST out at this point I did like what Sega did when they closed the PSO servers Is that for the people that were running private servers They actually gave them a way to transfer characters and things

356
00:28:39,332 --> 00:28:57,849
[SPEAKER_09]: and I would think that if people are actually still playing that then there should be some other way to host your own server for it or something and have that be like an external for some reason I don't see Microsoft supporting that out of the companies like I could see why Sega would do that but I could see why Microsoft would not if that makes sense

357
00:28:58,589 --> 00:29:25,716
[SPEAKER_04]: and SJ100 Matt in our chatroom says in the end nothing lasts forever and I guess that's another point as well is that hey you know that game you got a good six or seven year run out of it right no no wait I'm saying too much that's how long Xbox Live has been around Halo 2 has probably been going what about four or five years about it came out while we were doing this show I played Halo 1 for the first time and we were on the air so it's been around for five years five years that's a pretty good run

358
00:29:27,603 --> 00:29:32,227
[SPEAKER_04]: GameGuru in chat says, Microsoft will more than likely make Halo 2 an Xbox Live Arcade title, if anything.

359
00:29:32,287 --> 00:29:32,827
[SPEAKER_04]: I could see that.

360
00:29:33,508 --> 00:29:33,888
[SPEAKER_04]: I could see that.

361
00:29:33,908 --> 00:29:34,489
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be kind of cool.

362
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:35,930
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be kind of cool, actually.

363
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,191
[SPEAKER_04]: That might actually bring me back to Halo 2.

364
00:29:37,951 --> 00:29:38,251
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

365
00:29:38,632 --> 00:29:40,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially with some souped up graphics and so forth.

366
00:29:40,353 --> 00:29:41,694
[SPEAKER_04]: But, oh well.

367
00:29:42,735 --> 00:29:44,897
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, again in chat, you said it good.

368
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:46,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing lasts forever.

369
00:29:46,438 --> 00:29:49,721
[SPEAKER_04]: And someday they're going to shut down the servers for all the games we're playing today.

370
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:53,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably in five years when we've moved on to the Xbox 720s and so forth.

371
00:29:54,444 --> 00:29:55,385
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

372
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:23,796
[SPEAKER_04]: There's TVs all over the house.

373
00:30:23,856 --> 00:30:28,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a TV on the kitchen table, a TV in the living room, a TV everywhere.

374
00:30:28,478 --> 00:30:30,639
[SPEAKER_04]: And they all had Nintendos hooked up.

375
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,641
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, what the hell is going on here?

376
00:30:34,101 --> 00:30:37,322
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jamie's like, they're having a LAN party, a local area Nintendo party.

377
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:42,104
[SPEAKER_04]: All these TVs had Nintendo systems hooked up and they were playing The Legend of Zelda.

378
00:30:42,505 --> 00:30:47,167
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess they were having a contest to see who could beat The Legend of Zelda first.

379
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:50,528
[SPEAKER_04]: and some people were like already on the seventh dungeon.

380
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:52,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I think your husband was really far ahead.

381
00:30:52,189 --> 00:30:53,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think Dan actually won that one.

382
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:54,130
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure he did.

383
00:30:54,451 --> 00:30:55,871
[SPEAKER_04]: And some people were still struggling.

384
00:30:55,891 --> 00:30:59,874
[SPEAKER_04]: They were on like dungeon three and some people were in the overworld so I couldn't really tell where they were at.

385
00:31:00,254 --> 00:31:04,116
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just remember thinking, that is the fucking coolest thing I've ever seen.

386
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:09,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I was like, Jamie and I are going to get along just fine because this had to be about a year before we started OLR.

387
00:31:09,259 --> 00:31:15,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean it was a while before OLR but I just remember thinking, wow, this is all kinds of awesome.

388
00:31:16,529 --> 00:31:35,368
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of miss that house except I don't miss where it was yeah so anyway I just wanted to tell that story if you never heard it before here on the show because I always think that's hilarious and I would love nothing more than to see another LAN party happen somewhere somehow I think that would be a lot of fun so if there's ever if Dan ever decides he's doing another Nintendo party I want in

389
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,470
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to bring my FC Mobile.

390
00:31:38,371 --> 00:31:42,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep in mind, though, we probably got three other NESs, and you have an NES.

391
00:31:42,855 --> 00:31:44,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's right, I do have the NES.

392
00:31:44,116 --> 00:31:46,098
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have that, but I don't have a Zelda cart, but we can get one.

393
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:48,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I've got like three of them hanging around somewhere.

394
00:31:48,641 --> 00:31:49,521
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.

395
00:31:49,601 --> 00:31:53,185
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the batteries, I think, finally died in one of them, but we've also got Zelda 2.

396
00:31:53,825 --> 00:31:57,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Those batteries were only guaranteed to last like five years, but most of them have lasted like 20.

397
00:31:58,069 --> 00:31:58,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

398
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,591
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty crazy.

399
00:32:00,391 --> 00:32:01,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow, sorry guys.

400
00:32:01,972 --> 00:32:04,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Got a little tangent, but that happens here on this show sometimes.

401
00:32:05,013 --> 00:32:06,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, bring us back with some more gaming news.

402
00:32:07,674 --> 00:32:07,874
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

403
00:32:09,254 --> 00:32:19,558
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, Facebook's been getting a lot of games recently, and a lot of them have been pretty basic, and they're starting to get some better stuff, like with the new Civilization game and whatnot.

404
00:32:20,018 --> 00:32:23,419
[SPEAKER_11]: But now they're actually getting a first-person shooter game.

405
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:27,200
[SPEAKER_11]: This game's called Brave Arms, and it actually looks kind of cool.

406
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,001
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of like a...

407
00:32:29,261 --> 00:32:32,643
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if the Quake Online stuff, like Quake Zero or whatever.

408
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:34,624
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's pretty cool.

409
00:32:34,664 --> 00:32:36,565
[SPEAKER_11]: It's from 3G Studios.

410
00:32:37,626 --> 00:32:41,148
[SPEAKER_11]: And apparently it's set to come out in March.

411
00:32:42,268 --> 00:32:45,470
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's kind of similar to a Doom, Quake, Halo, Call of Duty.

412
00:32:46,811 --> 00:32:46,971
[SPEAKER_11]: But...

413
00:32:48,752 --> 00:32:49,693
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

414
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:09,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Patent pending.

415
00:33:09,411 --> 00:33:10,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Patent pending.

416
00:33:33,314 --> 00:33:34,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, would you play a game like that for free?

417
00:33:35,195 --> 00:33:36,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'd check it out at least.

418
00:33:37,176 --> 00:33:41,317
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Quake Live.

419
00:33:41,697 --> 00:33:43,558
[SPEAKER_04]: I played that for a little bit when it first came out.

420
00:33:43,618 --> 00:33:47,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was cool because it was based off Quake 3, which was like the best freaking Quake they ever did.

421
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,960
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, somebody in chat agrees with me.

422
00:33:50,441 --> 00:33:50,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

423
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:51,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Who is it?

424
00:33:51,741 --> 00:33:56,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah yes, ZenthralZen says, Quake 3 Arena, best LAN party game ever, period.

425
00:33:57,404 --> 00:33:59,645
[SPEAKER_04]: It was one of the best over the internet games too.

426
00:33:59,665 --> 00:34:00,845
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a lot of fun to play.

427
00:34:01,585 --> 00:34:02,346
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a good time with that one.

428
00:34:03,446 --> 00:34:08,388
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see how this Facebook game goes, but I'm telling you guys, this is the direction gaming's moving.

429
00:34:08,769 --> 00:34:11,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Facebook as a platform for gaming.

430
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:17,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty soon you're going to be talking Xbox 360, Wii, PS3, PC, and Facebook gaming.

431
00:34:18,033 --> 00:34:18,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and iPhones.

432
00:34:18,493 --> 00:34:19,474
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to throw that in there too.

433
00:34:20,074 --> 00:34:22,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Facebook is like a serious platform for gaming.

434
00:34:24,877 --> 00:34:25,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Believe it or not.

435
00:34:26,504 --> 00:34:29,825
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing to take very seriously, as a lot of people do, is World of Warcraft.

436
00:34:29,865 --> 00:34:32,806
[SPEAKER_04]: And some people take the auction house dealings very seriously.

437
00:34:32,846 --> 00:34:36,647
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, some people kind of play the economy as like the game.

438
00:34:37,067 --> 00:34:42,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't really get into the whole auction house dealings, so I'm not sure exactly what they do, but I guess it's kind of like the stock market.

439
00:34:43,368 --> 00:34:49,930
[SPEAKER_04]: You buy items that are plentiful, and then when they're not available, you sell them at a high profit, is basically what it is.

440
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:55,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, people that play World of Warcraft for the auctions and for the markets are in for a big surprise.

441
00:34:55,354 --> 00:34:56,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Because guess what?

442
00:34:56,194 --> 00:35:09,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, Blizzard has announced this week that soon you are going to be able to manage your auctions from World of Warcraft using the Armory application on the iPhone or iPod Touch.

443
00:35:10,253 --> 00:35:12,775
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know much about exactly how this will work yet.

444
00:35:12,816 --> 00:35:22,945
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know the specifics like can you access your in-game mail too because that's the only way you get the money from your auctions or how would you post something if you can't access your character's bags or what have you.

445
00:35:23,226 --> 00:35:24,927
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know the answer to all the specifics yet.

446
00:35:24,947 --> 00:35:30,372
[SPEAKER_04]: We just know that Blizzard is throwing out that idea of you could play the economical game of World of Warcraft on the go.

447
00:35:31,033 --> 00:35:31,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

448
00:35:31,793 --> 00:35:36,755
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, one thing they are saying with this as well is that it will cost money.

449
00:35:36,815 --> 00:35:39,436
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a premium-based service.

450
00:35:39,577 --> 00:35:42,318
[SPEAKER_04]: They've said premium-based, which you know that means cost money.

451
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:50,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't know if that'll be a monthly thing that you add on for your character or what I would assume would be the option would be you charge for the app on the iPhone.

452
00:35:51,421 --> 00:35:55,343
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to be releasing this on the iPhone, you're going to charge $9.99 for the app or something like that.

453
00:35:56,003 --> 00:35:57,244
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how they will make their money.

454
00:35:58,086 --> 00:36:04,835
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, I know you're not a big WoW player anymore, but let's say they had an equivalent in Star Trek Online, or let's imagine you did still play WoW.

455
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:06,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think this is the kind of thing you'd be interested in?

456
00:36:07,551 --> 00:36:11,233
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as it's free But it's not, so you wouldn't pay a premium for it?

457
00:36:11,533 --> 00:36:20,396
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I wouldn't Then again, this is the person who just bought, you know, a thousand cryptic points Why do you think someone would be into this?

458
00:36:20,456 --> 00:36:36,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you think someone would say, hey, because I'm looking at this going, you know, as awesome as this feature sounds And depending on the cost, I might just, like if it is just like five bucks for the app, I might just buy it to check it out I don't see myself really using it, like it's kind of weird to be using that on the phone

459
00:36:36,383 --> 00:36:42,427
[SPEAKER_09]: I was trying to look at the page for the interface and everything.

460
00:36:42,547 --> 00:36:43,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they don't have that yet.

461
00:36:43,407 --> 00:36:45,729
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all they've said now is an announcement.

462
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:51,032
[SPEAKER_09]: I used the Armory itself, but I don't know.

463
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,733
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not that obsessed about the games I play.

464
00:36:52,933 --> 00:36:53,473
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, really.

465
00:36:54,294 --> 00:36:55,194
[SPEAKER_09]: It's something for addicts.

466
00:36:56,835 --> 00:37:02,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, I know you're not a big MMO player anymore, but let's assume this was five years ago and this was a Final Fantasy XI auction house app.

467
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:03,660
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?

468
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,162
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's an app for an iPhone or something like that, right?

469
00:37:07,702 --> 00:37:11,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, but let's say it was something you could access on the web too or something, I don't know.

470
00:37:12,245 --> 00:37:12,405
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

471
00:37:13,006 --> 00:37:13,186
[SPEAKER_04]: No?

472
00:37:13,646 --> 00:37:14,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Not for you?

473
00:37:14,286 --> 00:37:14,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Not for me.

474
00:37:15,427 --> 00:37:16,508
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I go into game.

475
00:37:18,029 --> 00:37:18,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Good point.

476
00:37:19,009 --> 00:37:27,755
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to admit, although I might be willing to kind of check it out just for the sake of checking it out, I don't know if I'd want to pay a monthly fee just to manage my auctions.

477
00:37:27,975 --> 00:37:31,538
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's kind of what... And the other thing that kind of worries me

478
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:41,601
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like my one little weird worry and I don't know maybe the chatters can tell me if I'm being irrational with this but I kind of always thought this was how a lot of the gold farmers made their money.

479
00:37:42,441 --> 00:37:53,144
[SPEAKER_04]: So by kind of allowing folks to do this without being actually in the game could you possibly be encouraging the gold farming community and the people that are hacking and stealing accounts?

480
00:37:54,084 --> 00:37:57,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that an irrational line of thought or do I have a legitimate concern there?

481
00:37:58,925 --> 00:37:59,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

482
00:38:00,426 --> 00:38:00,866
[SPEAKER_04]: You tell me.

483
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:05,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com We'll get to some of that feedback in just a moment.

484
00:38:05,028 --> 00:38:06,269
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll move on with the news for now.

485
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:08,050
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

486
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:14,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, you remember when we were talking about Akira Yamaoka leaving Konami?

487
00:38:15,905 --> 00:38:16,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we know where he ended up.

488
00:38:17,527 --> 00:38:29,781
[SPEAKER_09]: He's with Grasshopper Manufacture and is supposed to be doing music for an upcoming horror game that they're doing that's produced by Shinji Mikami.

489
00:38:30,662 --> 00:38:30,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

490
00:38:32,183 --> 00:38:45,158
[SPEAKER_09]: So, maybe it's going to be going back to, you know, more of the, a game that has the feel of the older Silent Hill, you know, not necessarily the kind of Americanized ones now, you know what I mean?

491
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:52,466
[SPEAKER_09]: But just if it puts anything in perspective, Grasshopper did Fatal Frame 4 and No More Heroes 2, so...

492
00:38:54,294 --> 00:38:58,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you know that they have the translation project for Fatal Frame 4?

493
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:02,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think we covered that a few weeks ago, probably about a month ago on the show.

494
00:39:02,618 --> 00:39:03,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I remember that.

495
00:39:03,138 --> 00:39:05,659
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's pretty cool.

496
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:13,282
[SPEAKER_09]: If that's the kind of game he's going to work on, then perhaps it's a worthy thing that he's jumped ship.

497
00:39:13,843 --> 00:39:21,706
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know where I read this, and it's probably just one of those fan wank rumors, I don't know, but I had heard that EA was courting Akira Yamaoka.

498
00:39:22,509 --> 00:39:25,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, EA is producing the game that Grasshopper's working on.

499
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:26,250
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

500
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:29,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it was kind of jumping to conclusions type of thing.

501
00:39:29,752 --> 00:39:30,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Possibly.

502
00:39:30,812 --> 00:39:31,232
[SPEAKER_04]: That could be.

503
00:39:31,252 --> 00:39:39,355
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, maybe this would lead to Akira Yamaoka getting to do whatever Silent Hill-y horror game I'm sure EA would be more than happy to publish.

504
00:39:39,775 --> 00:39:40,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I wouldn't doubt that at all.

505
00:39:40,936 --> 00:39:41,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

506
00:39:42,016 --> 00:39:42,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

507
00:39:44,437 --> 00:39:46,258
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that man is pretty much Silent Hill.

508
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:54,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Going back to the chatroom, chat.orangelearnersradio.com and some of the comments from the auction app for WoW.

509
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:59,358
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom says, I bet there will be an auction house app for Final Fantasy XIV.

510
00:39:59,758 --> 00:40:05,663
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it will be interesting to see how Squeenix kind of embraces all this stuff that WoW is doing.

511
00:40:05,863 --> 00:40:10,547
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed for XI, especially towards the end, they tried to do some...

512
00:40:11,267 --> 00:40:12,389
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

513
00:40:33,691 --> 00:40:34,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see other comments from chat room.

514
00:40:35,472 --> 00:40:36,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Xlink says, I'm not buying it.

515
00:40:37,793 --> 00:40:42,116
[SPEAKER_04]: And it also says that he thought of the same thing that I was mentioning with the gold farmers.

516
00:40:42,597 --> 00:40:44,858
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why he's not using it.

517
00:40:45,999 --> 00:40:48,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Also was a quick shout out there from HitStun.

518
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Does Dissida have any Final Fantasy XI characters?

519
00:40:51,183 --> 00:40:55,265
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Mac clarifying, yes, there's a quick cameo of a Final Fantasy XI character.

520
00:40:55,746 --> 00:40:58,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XI is tricky to do because...

521
00:40:59,048 --> 00:41:01,389
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no standard hero.

522
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:06,953
[SPEAKER_04]: You were the hero and you could look a variety of different ways, you know, because you could customize your character.

523
00:41:06,973 --> 00:41:09,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Although everyone had the same outfit over and over and over and over.

524
00:41:10,195 --> 00:41:10,555
[SPEAKER_04]: For real.

525
00:41:10,575 --> 00:41:12,136
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the customization was very limited.

526
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:15,798
[SPEAKER_09]: I did like, so seeing the male characters walking around in their leather mantis.

527
00:41:16,179 --> 00:41:16,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes.

528
00:41:16,879 --> 00:41:18,260
[SPEAKER_04]: There was always a, what were they called?

529
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,262
[SPEAKER_04]: The bronze, or whatever.

530
00:41:22,282 --> 00:41:25,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it looked like mantis, basically, who was running around and it was really funny.

531
00:41:25,084 --> 00:41:27,165
[SPEAKER_04]: With a harness.

532
00:41:27,506 --> 00:41:27,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

533
00:41:27,746 --> 00:41:27,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

534
00:41:30,207 --> 00:41:36,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's... But some of like maybe the boss characters and some of the NPCs that you interact with I could see being in the game.

535
00:41:36,252 --> 00:41:37,533
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's what they were talking about.

536
00:41:37,893 --> 00:41:38,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure it is too.

537
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:39,994
[SPEAKER_04]: S2100Mac clarifies it's a TaruTaru.

538
00:41:40,775 --> 00:41:40,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Which...

539
00:41:41,474 --> 00:41:42,755
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one of the characters that's in the game.

540
00:41:42,775 --> 00:41:45,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't surprise me at all, because Tarotaro is what everybody remembers.

541
00:41:46,176 --> 00:41:50,858
[SPEAKER_04]: And even in Final Fantasy XIV, they're going to have Tarotaros, but they're not calling them Tarotaros.

542
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:52,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's retarded.

543
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:53,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is so weird to me.

544
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:55,380
[SPEAKER_04]: It is absolutely retarded.

545
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, whatever.

546
00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:58,341
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as the game is good, I don't care.

547
00:41:58,422 --> 00:42:01,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Call them Sexy Chocolate for all I care.

548
00:42:01,383 --> 00:42:02,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Sexy Chocolate?

549
00:42:02,563 --> 00:42:03,884
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

550
00:42:03,944 --> 00:42:06,105
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to roll a Sexy Chocolate White Mage.

551
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:11,580
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how that works, but...

552
00:42:37,343 --> 00:42:39,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh god, we need to do some release dates.

553
00:42:39,305 --> 00:42:41,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Quick, please, change the topic, help.

554
00:42:41,827 --> 00:42:51,815
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, well this isn't anything to do with sexy chocolate, but I guess since next week is Valentine's week, and I guess it could be sexy chocolate.

555
00:42:52,215 --> 00:43:01,422
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're into that kind of thing for Dante's Inferno, because nothing says sexy chocolate like tortured souls in hell, uh...

556
00:43:02,823 --> 00:43:04,405
[SPEAKER_11]: Star Ocean Last Hope International Edition

557
00:43:27,044 --> 00:43:42,864
[SPEAKER_11]: Family Party, 30 Great Games, Winter Fun, yet another party game compilation for the Wii World Cup of Pool, coming to the DS Shirin the Wanderer, coming to the Wii, which looks pretty awesome, that's from Atlus

558
00:43:43,645 --> 00:43:52,251
[SPEAKER_11]: and, of course, the big one for the week, Bioshock 2, making its way out on PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.

559
00:43:52,872 --> 00:43:57,796
[SPEAKER_11]: Or, if you're a teenage girl, perhaps seeing Twilight is the big game for you this week.

560
00:43:58,216 --> 00:43:59,397
[SPEAKER_11]: That will be out on the DS.

561
00:44:03,339 --> 00:44:09,321
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want none of those or just own a Wii, then perhaps Super Monkey Ball Step and Roll will be your type of game.

562
00:44:09,581 --> 00:44:11,741
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's coming out just on the Wii.

563
00:44:12,001 --> 00:44:21,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you know how much it would amuse me, especially for the YouTube channel, if we were to follow you with a camera to one of those midnight releases for Dante's Inferno or Bioshock 2, because they're both coming out at the same time, right?

564
00:44:22,083 --> 00:44:24,924
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you walk up to the counter and ask for a scene at Twilight.

565
00:44:25,544 --> 00:44:26,164
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love that.

566
00:44:26,184 --> 00:44:28,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Except I wouldn't want to do that.

567
00:44:29,085 --> 00:44:44,254
[SPEAKER_09]: by the way the reason why that's called the Divine Edition is because the Inferno was part of the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri so that's why it's called the Divine Version there you go which I've read that in 5th grade

568
00:44:45,153 --> 00:44:51,618
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought it was called the Divine Edition because it's like, you know, Sony's way of saying, hey, look, we have something exclusive.

569
00:44:52,378 --> 00:45:00,764
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, we may have lost Final Fantasy, you know, 13 and, you know, Residents of Fate and all the other games that have come out.

570
00:45:00,825 --> 00:45:02,766
[SPEAKER_11]: But hey, we still got the Divine Edition.

571
00:45:03,246 --> 00:45:05,568
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not gonna be able to get that download content until later.

572
00:45:06,028 --> 00:45:08,430
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just trying to be all literary and cultured and shit.

573
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:13,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought they called it the Divine Edition because the Sexy Chocolate Edition just got rejected is what it was.

574
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:15,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Fail.

575
00:45:16,152 --> 00:45:16,453
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

576
00:45:17,073 --> 00:45:19,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, some other release dates for Japan.

577
00:45:20,394 --> 00:45:22,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Game coming out on the Xbox 360 this week.

578
00:45:22,494 --> 00:45:26,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Sacred 2 Fallen Angel makes its way to Japan this week.

579
00:45:26,856 --> 00:45:28,696
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm trying to see what kind of game this is.

580
00:45:28,856 --> 00:45:30,377
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a role-playing game.

581
00:45:30,797 --> 00:45:33,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, okay, I can see that, but I'm trying to figure out what more about this.

582
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this like a Final Fantasy-ish kind of game?

583
00:45:36,802 --> 00:45:39,645
[SPEAKER_04]: The graphics look interesting, kind of like in a desert.

584
00:45:39,705 --> 00:45:40,866
[SPEAKER_04]: It came out here last year.

585
00:45:40,906 --> 00:45:41,426
[SPEAKER_04]: It sucked.

586
00:45:42,467 --> 00:45:42,787
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

587
00:45:43,168 --> 00:45:45,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there's like a not-Chocobo in the game there that you can ride.

588
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:47,491
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't localize this for the U.S., though, right?

589
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:48,732
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a Boca Cho.

590
00:45:49,393 --> 00:45:49,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

591
00:45:50,354 --> 00:45:53,156
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the reviews, though, I'm reading online, this game is massive.

592
00:45:53,196 --> 00:45:55,038
[SPEAKER_04]: There's tons of quests, and the level cap is 200.

593
00:45:55,098 --> 00:45:55,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows, though?

594
00:45:55,959 --> 00:45:57,060
[SPEAKER_04]: That was probably written by the publisher.

595
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:25,493
[SPEAKER_04]: if you don't want to play that on the Xbox 360 you could check it out on PlayStation 3 because it's coming out there too as well as a game called Winter Sports 2010 The Great Tournament I'm assuming that's like coming from a company who didn't get the Olympic license but wants to cash in on it anyway so there you go if you want you can check out on the Nintendo Wii Mad World makes its way for Japan this week that is a Japanese localized release on the Nintendo Wii this week coming from Sega

596
00:46:26,413 --> 00:46:54,601
[SPEAKER_04]: and unfortunately a lot of folks passed here but maybe if it does very well in Japan there'll still be a sequel so you might want to consider picking that up on the Nintendo DS this week Mina no Konveni comes out this week and it is a strategy based game but when I say that it looks like a little girl going cooking it's not cooking mama but kind of like cafeteria managing maybe kind of a version of Diner Dash I don't know kind of what it strikes me as from the pictures I see there

597
00:46:55,241 --> 00:47:00,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Quickly taking a look at the PSP, Shin Sangoku Musou Multirade gets a price reduction.

598
00:47:01,005 --> 00:47:03,707
[SPEAKER_04]: That game is already out, but it's getting a little price cut this week.

599
00:47:04,408 --> 00:47:05,949
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Dynasty Warriors Strike Force.

600
00:47:06,309 --> 00:47:08,431
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you might know the game better as.

601
00:47:08,991 --> 00:47:10,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are your Japanese release dates.

602
00:47:11,633 --> 00:47:13,675
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what's going on overseas in the UK?

603
00:47:13,695 --> 00:47:14,115
[SPEAKER_04]: The other way.

604
00:47:14,375 --> 00:47:16,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, for the UK, we've got a few goodies.

605
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:20,965
[SPEAKER_09]: We have Bioshock 2 on the 9th and on the 10th, Darwinia.

606
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:30,019
[SPEAKER_09]: And the 12th is Bleach the Third Phantom, Half-Minute Hero, Phantasy Star Zero, Star Ocean, The Last Hope, and Super Monkey Ball Step and Roll.

607
00:47:33,081 --> 00:47:33,401
[SPEAKER_11]: Alrighty.

608
00:47:34,462 --> 00:47:34,702
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool.

609
00:47:36,043 --> 00:47:38,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so this is kind of interesting.

610
00:47:38,484 --> 00:47:45,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently there is a developer resume, um, that's hinting at an Xbox 360 version of Final Fantasy 14.

611
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:54,274
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, apparently also this is, uh, was being, uh, removed a few hours later.

612
00:47:55,315 --> 00:47:55,835
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um,

613
00:47:56,935 --> 00:48:08,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently this profile that was on a website linked in for designer Yuki Akama referenced work on Final Fantasy XIV for PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.

614
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:15,241
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, only the PC and PS3 platforms have been officially confirmed to be coming out.

615
00:48:16,081 --> 00:48:21,444
[SPEAKER_04]: And not only that, but Sony took great pride in last year's E3 at saying you can only play this on the PlayStation 3.

616
00:48:22,785 --> 00:48:28,048
[SPEAKER_04]: And leading many folks to question if the Xbox Live hurdle proved to be too much for Squeenix to deal with.

617
00:48:28,508 --> 00:48:30,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I'm sure Microsoft doesn't want to lose that.

618
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:34,252
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure we'll hear whether it's coming out on the 360 or not.

619
00:48:36,573 --> 00:48:37,834
[SPEAKER_11]: Earlier this week I thought it was.

620
00:48:38,214 --> 00:48:40,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you ever use the website LinkedIn, Matt?

621
00:48:40,635 --> 00:48:40,736
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

622
00:48:41,116 --> 00:48:45,538
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like a professional Facebook, I think is the best way I can describe it.

623
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:58,226
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a profile on there, and basically it's kind of like a place where you can post your resume and do job searches, but it's supposed to be a way to professionally connect with your coworkers and people they know and so forth.

624
00:48:59,266 --> 00:49:03,529
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more like a professional LinkedIn, and there are quite a few of the gaming community uses that.

625
00:49:03,869 --> 00:49:07,471
[SPEAKER_04]: I've connected with quite a few other podcast hosts and so forth on LinkedIn.

626
00:49:07,971 --> 00:49:34,834
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure it will come out on 360 it only makes sense I mean more people that they can get on the service the better it is for them so I don't see why they wouldn't it just seems weird to me that Sony was so excited about it and then just to lose this again you know because this would be twice in a row with the whole Final Fantasy 13 thing going to Xbox that's gonna be a blow to the ego um we'll see like I said um

627
00:49:35,566 --> 00:49:36,146
[SPEAKER_11]: I think a version of...

628
00:49:53,331 --> 00:49:58,714
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a version on the 360 could be eventually, but it would seem like that might come out later.

629
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:06,018
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's the other thing, Squeenix doesn't seem to think that Final Fantasy will do well on 360 in Japan.

630
00:50:06,058 --> 00:50:12,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep in mind, Final Fantasy 13, not happening on the 360 in Japan, or hasn't happened yet because the game's already out there.

631
00:50:12,861 --> 00:50:21,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe the same type of thing is happening where they're going to release Final Fantasy XIV on the 360 here in America and only here and maybe Europe too.

632
00:50:23,648 --> 00:50:29,611
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe they don't want to hold up the debut of the game to make the 360 version.

633
00:50:29,792 --> 00:50:30,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that make sense?

634
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:32,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they're going to do a worldwide launch this time.

635
00:50:33,434 --> 00:50:35,455
[SPEAKER_04]: XI took like a year to get localized over here.

636
00:50:35,715 --> 00:50:38,397
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe Final Fantasy XIV they're going to throw it out there all at once.

637
00:50:38,497 --> 00:50:40,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Japan, US, and Europe.

638
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:41,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody gets it at once.

639
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,621
[SPEAKER_04]: And there'll be a 360 version someday.

640
00:50:43,662 --> 00:50:46,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Wouldn't it be hilarious if it became a 360 exclusive?

641
00:50:46,967 --> 00:50:47,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, no way.

642
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:49,210
[SPEAKER_04]: No way.

643
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:50,452
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be hilarious, though.

644
00:50:50,632 --> 00:50:56,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Just considering how, you know, Final Fantasy XI was really created as a PS2 game.

645
00:50:57,543 --> 00:51:25,731
[SPEAKER_04]: it was really made for the Playstation 2 I know a lot of us here in the states played it on the PC but part of the reason that game was so limited and finally outgrew itself and couldn't expand the way that WoW has continued to expand is because it's limited to the PS2 and that's why Final Fantasy 11 is kind of they're not going to really support that as much anymore I'm sure it will always be alive there will always be people playing Final Fantasy 11 but it's going to downsize big time when 14 comes out

646
00:51:28,899 --> 00:51:29,519
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what happens

647
00:51:53,172 --> 00:51:56,374
[SPEAKER_04]: is going to be announced at the Game Developers Conference.

648
00:51:56,854 --> 00:52:01,977
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's in a story that was run by the website VideoGamer.com from an industry source.

649
00:52:03,017 --> 00:52:09,741
[SPEAKER_04]: An employee at a major international publisher, obviously anonymous as you can imagine, quote, just heard a rumor that you may be interested in.

650
00:52:10,081 --> 00:52:13,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo are going to announce a new platform at GDC.

651
00:52:14,143 --> 00:52:16,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Some devs have already started work on it.

652
00:52:17,345 --> 00:52:21,367
[SPEAKER_04]: So we don't know if that could be a redone handheld.

653
00:52:21,407 --> 00:52:28,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think we've already heard rumblings of a DS2, even though there's the XL still has yet to come out here in the US.

654
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:30,031
[SPEAKER_04]: We've heard rumblings of a DS2.

655
00:52:30,631 --> 00:52:33,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Some fanboys are hoping it's finally the Wii HD already.

656
00:52:34,973 --> 00:52:35,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows what it could be?

657
00:52:35,874 --> 00:52:38,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Could it maybe be an enhancement to the existing Wii?

658
00:52:38,476 --> 00:52:41,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't want to joke the Vitality Sensor, but something in that vein?

659
00:52:43,379 --> 00:52:44,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably nothing like that.

660
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:46,241
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if they would do another Wii.

661
00:52:46,622 --> 00:52:49,284
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, because it's selling like hotcakes right now.

662
00:52:49,404 --> 00:52:50,244
[SPEAKER_11]: What would be the point?

663
00:52:51,045 --> 00:52:56,909
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, trying to put some now I'd see maybe another handheld system because maybe that's starting to slow down a little bit.

664
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:59,411
[SPEAKER_11]: But I doubt they would be doing a Wii.

665
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:07,505
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to build one that you implant into your brain so you can just play until you have seizures.

666
00:53:07,765 --> 00:53:28,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Unless they're trying to stay ahead, they're worried that maybe once these other motion controllers come out for Microsoft and PlayStation 3 and Sony, that you're going to have an even playing field and then they're going to just fail based on the quality of their product because now you're going to have these really pretty looking games that control just like they do on the Wii

667
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:37,483
[SPEAKER_11]: and people are going to be more apt to maybe buying those, which I don't think that's true, but maybe they're just trying to stay one step ahead.

668
00:53:37,763 --> 00:53:40,405
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't know.

669
00:53:40,465 --> 00:53:43,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Either way, I'm not too excited about it.

670
00:53:44,127 --> 00:53:49,290
[SPEAKER_04]: In our chat room at chat.org.com, MaginamiCon, I hope I said that right, says, what, a phone?

671
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:51,531
[SPEAKER_04]: The end phone?

672
00:53:51,571 --> 00:53:52,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Could that happen?

673
00:53:53,633 --> 00:53:56,334
[SPEAKER_04]: I somehow doubt that, but that would be an interesting idea, sure.

674
00:53:56,354 --> 00:53:56,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

675
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:02,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting too, I kind of want to say, if this is true, I don't think it's true.

676
00:54:03,019 --> 00:54:09,342
[SPEAKER_04]: I think some things might happen behind closed doors at Game Developers Conference, but I don't think you're going to see the major announcement until E3.

677
00:54:09,742 --> 00:54:12,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Game Developers Conference is not a media show.

678
00:54:12,283 --> 00:54:15,384
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't strike me as the place to announce a new platform.

679
00:54:15,904 --> 00:54:24,128
[SPEAKER_04]: The place to announce maybe a revision, I could see like a DSi XL or something there, even though it's already out in Japan, but you know what I mean, like a slightly altered version.

680
00:54:24,628 --> 00:54:26,629
[SPEAKER_04]: An enhancement or a new tool

681
00:54:27,789 --> 00:54:37,374
[SPEAKER_04]: I could see more Natal information coming out of GDC and some of the things that enhance gaming, but I don't see a full-on new platform being announced at Game Developers Conference.

682
00:54:37,414 --> 00:54:38,434
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a media show.

683
00:54:38,634 --> 00:54:40,595
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for game developers.

684
00:54:40,655 --> 00:54:41,355
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in the title.

685
00:54:41,656 --> 00:54:46,138
[SPEAKER_04]: I know people think it's a media show and it's turning into one, but it's not supposed to be.

686
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:46,998
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really, really not.

687
00:54:47,078 --> 00:54:48,619
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think a lot of people resent that it is.

688
00:54:49,279 --> 00:54:59,646
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think if Nintendo is going to make an announcement, which I think it is the DS, I think the DS is going to get the revamp, you're going to see it at E3, not a Game Developers Conference.

689
00:54:59,946 --> 00:55:11,734
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, I know it is weird that I'm talking the DS revamp when we don't even have the XL here in the West, but I think Nintendo kind of knows that they could still put out the XL in limited quantities and it would sell if it was cheaper.

690
00:55:12,094 --> 00:55:31,458
[SPEAKER_04]: it would still sell to the 7 and 8 year olds and the mothers that like to play Pokemon and whatever, the soccer moms and whatever new DS system that will be $50 more expensive maybe even $100 more expensive will cater to the hardcore gamer who wants their Mario and Zelda games ASAP, right?

691
00:55:31,478 --> 00:55:33,339
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, does that seem far-fetched to you guys?

692
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:35,179
[SPEAKER_08]: no

693
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:49,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's see I'm sorry I can't be too contrary about that And some other comments in chat here Talking about MotionPlus, there's a couple people bringing up MotionPlus Like, was MotionPlus a flop?

694
00:55:49,158 --> 00:55:51,960
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, that's a good question Was MotionPlus a flop?

695
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,942
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think, Loki, from your perspective in sales?

696
00:55:54,422 --> 00:56:01,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Just that people, as far as rental stores and stuff go They don't want to bring in games that have MotionPlus Because they're afraid that people don't have it

697
00:56:02,427 --> 00:56:04,088
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of like the whole Guitar Hero thing.

698
00:56:04,128 --> 00:56:08,829
[SPEAKER_11]: People don't want to bring it in because they're afraid that, you know, oh, it requires this.

699
00:56:08,969 --> 00:56:10,470
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not something that most people have.

700
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:12,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it a flop?

701
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:16,511
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if people are really all excited that, oh, God, this game has MotionPlus now.

702
00:56:16,551 --> 00:56:17,252
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be better.

703
00:56:17,812 --> 00:56:19,672
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really think it means anything yet.

704
00:56:19,853 --> 00:56:23,194
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there's only been a few games that have actually used it.

705
00:56:24,094 --> 00:56:26,355
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm sure they're pretty good.

706
00:56:26,635 --> 00:56:30,136
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just it's not, like, game-changing or anything.

707
00:56:30,156 --> 00:56:30,236
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

708
00:56:31,276 --> 00:56:33,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting comment from Blue Swim in our chatroom.

709
00:56:33,698 --> 00:56:35,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting creative idea.

710
00:56:35,479 --> 00:56:38,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Wii with groundbreaking DVD support.

711
00:56:39,842 --> 00:56:40,142
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

712
00:56:40,182 --> 00:56:42,023
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think anyone's going to care.

713
00:56:42,043 --> 00:56:46,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Most people are moving on to Blu-ray and stuff, and everything's a DVD player nowadays.

714
00:56:46,225 --> 00:56:51,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that's a creative outside-the-box answer for the topic at hand, but I just lean towards no.

715
00:56:51,609 --> 00:56:52,830
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Loki's right.

716
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:53,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's a DVD player.

717
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:56,492
[SPEAKER_04]: DVD players are like $40, probably less than that.

718
00:56:57,172 --> 00:56:58,233
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't need a DVD player.

719
00:57:00,043 --> 00:57:04,446
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a creative answer, but maybe a Wii revision with something else.

720
00:57:04,506 --> 00:57:07,748
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, it's going to go the way of MotionPlus.

721
00:57:07,788 --> 00:57:13,411
[SPEAKER_04]: The biggest problem with MotionPlus, it wasn't included with the console to begin with, so people are afraid not everyone has it.

722
00:57:13,831 --> 00:57:16,293
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very hard to launch a peripheral.

723
00:57:16,573 --> 00:57:18,774
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what Natal's uphill battle is going to be.

724
00:57:19,195 --> 00:57:24,158
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you read these articles and these rumors about the 360 is going to relaunch.

725
00:57:24,558 --> 00:57:29,561
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a new console per se, but they have to treat Natal like a relaunch of the damn system.

726
00:57:29,901 --> 00:57:30,541
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

727
00:57:59,076 --> 00:58:03,101
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't understand why they need to add on.

728
00:58:03,141 --> 00:58:06,805
[SPEAKER_11]: The only thing I can think of is better graphics maybe soup up the actual processor inside there.

729
00:58:07,445 --> 00:58:14,313
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if they're hitting the limits of what they can do on that system, maybe that would help.

730
00:58:14,473 --> 00:58:20,240
[SPEAKER_11]: But say the DSi for the Wii or something like that.

731
00:58:21,981 --> 00:58:26,543
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm afraid that whatever they do decide to put out is just going to be very gimmicky and stupid.

732
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:32,506
[SPEAKER_11]: It just gives them an excuse to put out another Mario game, another Metroid game, another Zelda game.

733
00:58:33,386 --> 00:58:35,747
[SPEAKER_11]: And look, oh look, it's new, but it's not.

734
00:58:35,767 --> 00:58:36,628
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

735
00:58:37,697 --> 00:58:41,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're going to get into the classic game of the week here in just a moment and wrap up part A of our show.

736
00:58:42,042 --> 00:58:44,845
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do want to say hello to all the folks who are tuning in live tonight.

737
00:58:44,865 --> 00:58:46,067
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess the Super Bowl is over.

738
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:50,552
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now we have some folks kind of coming back to us now that the football game is over.

739
00:58:50,592 --> 00:58:51,253
[SPEAKER_04]: So welcome, guys.

740
00:58:51,593 --> 00:58:52,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Glad you could tune in tonight.

741
00:58:52,555 --> 00:58:55,358
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to recap quickly the things we have talked about tonight.

742
00:58:55,998 --> 00:59:01,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to the podcast listeners and the folks that listen to us at the top of the show, but I want everyone to know what we've already covered.

743
00:59:01,501 --> 00:59:04,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Sonic the 4 Episode 1 was already announced this week.

744
00:59:05,003 --> 00:59:06,843
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Project Needlemouse's other name.

745
00:59:07,224 --> 00:59:09,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Blaster Master Overdrive has surprised us.

746
00:59:09,305 --> 00:59:10,585
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be out on Monday.

747
00:59:11,426 --> 00:59:17,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox and Microsoft is ditching live support for the original Xbox, so Halo 2 fans are pissed.

748
00:59:17,509 --> 00:59:19,610
[SPEAKER_04]: But the rest of us will gain a friends list with more than 100 friends.

749
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:23,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Facebook is getting a new first-person shooter game called Brave Arms.

750
00:59:24,192 --> 00:59:26,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Facebook is a gaming platform, you betcha.

751
00:59:26,673 --> 00:59:34,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Blizzard has been announcing, teasing the idea of a premium auction house application for World of Warcraft so you can manage your auctions offline.

752
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:36,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Akira Yamaoka has found a new home.

753
00:59:36,498 --> 00:59:41,401
[SPEAKER_04]: He left Konami a couple months ago and now he's at Grasshopper working with the folks that did No More Heroes.

754
00:59:41,841 --> 00:59:42,902
[SPEAKER_04]: We covered release dates.

755
00:59:43,382 --> 00:59:56,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XIV, a developer's LinkedIn profile has clued us into the fact that it could be under development for the 360, but we seem to come to a consensus that if it is under development for the 360, it probably won't come out at the same time.

756
00:59:56,491 --> 00:59:58,753
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we just wrapped up talking about a story where Nintendo...

757
00:59:59,353 --> 01:00:00,234
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

758
01:00:28,909 --> 01:00:29,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Ew, it's sticky!

759
01:00:30,091 --> 01:00:33,096
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's a video game that you all should be playing.

760
01:00:34,281 --> 01:00:37,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's take a listen to Qbert and the awesome 1982 arcade noises.

761
01:01:07,931 --> 01:01:09,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, nope, he won.

762
01:01:11,033 --> 01:01:12,973
[SPEAKER_04]: And he even got bonuses for the two discs on the side.

763
01:01:13,614 --> 01:01:13,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

764
01:01:14,654 --> 01:01:16,375
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the little sound that the disc makes.

765
01:01:18,056 --> 01:01:18,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's him cussing.

766
01:01:18,896 --> 01:01:25,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, so Q-Bert was originally supposed to be a game about Q-Bert's big nose that could shoot projectiles.

767
01:01:26,019 --> 01:01:27,600
[SPEAKER_09]: And he would hop all over a pyramid.

768
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:29,281
[SPEAKER_09]: It was actually made by Warren Davis.

769
01:01:29,981 --> 01:01:31,342
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the high scoreboard, by the way.

770
01:01:31,362 --> 01:01:31,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi there!

771
01:01:31,642 --> 01:01:32,183
[SPEAKER_09]: In big letters.

772
01:01:32,203 --> 01:01:32,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi there!

773
01:01:32,423 --> 01:01:33,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome to the Noser Elite!

774
01:01:56,189 --> 01:02:09,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, so yeah, it is basically sort of puzzle and hopping around and, you know, the game actually gets really hard because, you know, your first few levels you only change it once and you've got enemies all over the board.

775
01:02:10,767 --> 01:02:10,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

776
01:02:12,589 --> 01:02:15,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, then you move on to it changing to two colors.

777
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,133
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to change the entire board.

778
01:02:17,573 --> 01:02:22,077
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it happens that you change to one color, and if you hop back on it, it changes back.

779
01:02:22,917 --> 01:02:27,521
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you have to get them all to match the final new color, and there's ones that change three times if you hop on them.

780
01:02:27,741 --> 01:02:32,325
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where the game just gets, like, disgustingly annoying.

781
01:02:32,525 --> 01:02:33,566
[SPEAKER_09]: I was really good at this.

782
01:02:34,847 --> 01:02:40,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I had the Clico version, Clico Vision version for a long time, which I still have.

783
01:02:40,532 --> 01:02:41,312
[SPEAKER_04]: I had the Commodore 64 version.

784
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:53,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but your, uh, little, uh, enemies are called Quailie, who's the purple snake, and Ugg and Wrongway, these little purple snotty creatures, and Slick and Sam that are the green boogers.

785
01:02:55,469 --> 01:02:55,829
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um...

786
01:02:59,255 --> 01:03:02,196
[SPEAKER_09]: You can ride the little discs up to the top of the pyramid.

787
01:03:02,356 --> 01:03:12,519
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you jump on the pyramid right, not on the pyramid, but on the disc right when one of the enemies are chasing you, or I should say Coily is chasing you, they'll hop off the edge behind you and die.

788
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:14,040
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't that great, Rob?

789
01:03:14,591 --> 01:03:14,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

790
01:03:16,133 --> 01:03:17,514
[SPEAKER_04]: That used to be how you'd have to do it.

791
01:03:17,534 --> 01:03:22,439
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd have to lure them towards a disc and then jump up there.

792
01:03:22,459 --> 01:03:26,323
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like what you were talking about last week during the Classic Game of the Week, which was linked to the past.

793
01:03:27,564 --> 01:03:35,051
[SPEAKER_04]: How you'd have in those dungeons, the guards would charge at you and if you were standing towards the edge, then you'd just run real fast and they'd charge right off the edge into oblivion.

794
01:03:35,892 --> 01:03:36,333
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great.

795
01:03:36,792 --> 01:03:47,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, um, the other thing about this, too, though, is that it was, um, produced by Gottlieb, who does a lot of, who did, I should say, a lot of, uh, pinball tables, too.

796
01:03:48,377 --> 01:04:02,022
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, it also, um, the, the guy who developed it, uh, Warren Ellis, uh, Warren Davis, sorry, um, was, uh, the guy who was behind, um, Revolution X, um,

797
01:04:02,142 --> 01:04:06,965
[SPEAKER_09]: and Terminator 2 and Lotto Fun, Joust 2 and Us vs. Them, which is a Laserdisc game.

798
01:04:07,766 --> 01:04:11,729
[SPEAKER_09]: So, he's been in... He was also on an episode of HouseMD.

799
01:04:11,769 --> 01:04:12,209
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't know that.

800
01:04:12,669 --> 01:04:19,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, he's, you know, been around, you know, in the industry for a while and brought out some pretty big classics.

801
01:04:20,114 --> 01:04:20,735
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, um...

802
01:04:23,678 --> 01:04:26,699
[SPEAKER_09]: It really is just a very simple little game, but it gets really hard.

803
01:04:27,279 --> 01:04:32,161
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as... There were other games that came out.

804
01:04:33,261 --> 01:04:38,283
[SPEAKER_09]: For Q-Bert itself, it came out on the Odyssey 2, which I have that system as well.

805
01:04:38,323 --> 01:04:39,563
[SPEAKER_09]: The Texas Instruments TI-99.

806
01:04:39,624 --> 01:04:41,664
[SPEAKER_09]: The Commodore VIC-20.

807
01:04:41,684 --> 01:04:44,745
[SPEAKER_09]: The Atari systems.

808
01:04:45,766 --> 01:04:45,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

809
01:04:47,126 --> 01:04:49,328
[SPEAKER_09]: The Atari 5200 version is ass, by the way.

810
01:04:49,989 --> 01:04:51,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Qbert was on everything from the 80s.

811
01:04:52,171 --> 01:04:52,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything.

812
01:04:52,511 --> 01:04:52,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, pretty much.

813
01:04:53,912 --> 01:05:01,579
[SPEAKER_09]: There was also a sequel, an actual sequel called Qbert's Cubes, which... Is not bad.

814
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:02,279
[SPEAKER_04]: I've played it.

815
01:05:02,459 --> 01:05:03,100
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of fun.

816
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's kind of fun.

817
01:05:04,761 --> 01:05:08,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Then there was Qbert 3 that came out on the NES, but it was very much like the first one.

818
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:13,029
[SPEAKER_09]: And there was a Qbert pinball, of course, Gottlieb put out, called Qbert's Quest.

819
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:14,350
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

820
01:05:16,354 --> 01:05:19,457
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a tabletop electronic game version.

821
01:05:21,739 --> 01:05:22,520
[SPEAKER_09]: All kinds of stuff.

822
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:34,912
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also a version that was put out by Davis that was called Faster, Harder, More Challenging Qbert and it's actually now out.

823
01:05:35,773 --> 01:05:38,095
[SPEAKER_09]: While he didn't put it into production, it's out for MAME.

824
01:05:38,195 --> 01:05:39,737
[SPEAKER_09]: He released the ROM image.

825
01:05:40,217 --> 01:05:40,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wow, cool.

826
01:05:41,278 --> 01:05:55,123
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, there's the updated Qbert that was on... Crap, now I can't remember which of the... But it was a 3D Qbert, like a Qbert remix or something.

827
01:05:55,283 --> 01:05:57,723
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there was one on PlayStation, I want to say.

828
01:05:57,984 --> 01:05:58,644
[SPEAKER_04]: I could be wrong.

829
01:06:00,344 --> 01:06:01,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there was one on PS3.

830
01:06:02,005 --> 01:06:03,805
[SPEAKER_09]: There was the 3D version of it.

831
01:06:03,865 --> 01:06:04,786
[SPEAKER_09]: It was supposed to be pretty good.

832
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:17,599
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I liked Qbert and all, and I would like to see this come out on the game room that Microsoft is doing, but I don't know if it will, because who owns the rights to the Gottlieb games now?

833
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't a board game company own them?

834
01:06:19,981 --> 01:06:21,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't Hasbro own them or something?

835
01:06:21,783 --> 01:06:22,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Something really weird?

836
01:06:23,204 --> 01:06:23,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

837
01:06:42,177 --> 01:07:11,185
[SPEAKER_04]: on the Commodore 64 version there was a mode where you could tilt your joystick 45 degrees so that way you used up, down, left, and right to control and then up went like actually to the upright and you know it made it a lot easier to control on the Commodore 64 trust me because trying to hit diagonal directions can you imagine trying to hit diagonal directions on the Xbox 360 D-pad no thank you hopefully if it does come out in game room you can use buttons for precision hopefully

838
01:07:11,892 --> 01:07:12,212
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

839
01:07:12,572 --> 01:07:14,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you know what else I remember, Rob?

840
01:07:14,453 --> 01:07:14,773
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

841
01:07:15,013 --> 01:07:17,113
[SPEAKER_09]: The Q-Bert cartoon when I was a kid.

842
01:07:18,074 --> 01:07:19,074
[SPEAKER_04]: I had the Q-Bert board game.

843
01:07:19,214 --> 01:07:19,814
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a board game.

844
01:07:21,054 --> 01:07:24,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, somewhere I may not still have it, but I had a Q-Bert plushie.

845
01:07:25,856 --> 01:07:26,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cute.

846
01:07:26,816 --> 01:07:27,476
[SPEAKER_09]: With his big nose.

847
01:07:28,216 --> 01:07:32,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well that's going to bring us to a close of Part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but we are not done yet.

848
01:07:33,017 --> 01:07:35,158

849
01:07:35,438 --> 01:07:39,379
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to talk about a new console from Sega, but it's not what you think.

850
01:07:39,981 --> 01:07:56,207

852
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:16,266
[SPEAKER_04]: It is Super Bowl Sunday here in the States.

853
01:08:17,047 --> 01:08:19,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really watch the game.

854
01:08:19,210 --> 01:08:20,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not really into football.

855
01:08:20,251 --> 01:08:20,972
[SPEAKER_12]: The Super Bowl.

856
01:08:21,112 --> 01:08:24,574
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know a lot of people watch it, so I know it was keeping people away from the show.

857
01:08:24,594 --> 01:08:26,596
[SPEAKER_04]: But now that it's over, you have no excuse.

858

01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:36,442
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, if you're listening to us on the podcast feed, you should try and make it for a live show sometime.

860
01:08:36,943 --> 01:08:38,223
[SPEAKER_04]: We will be here next Sunday.

861
01:08:38,444 --> 01:08:42,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Next Sunday is Valentine's Day, which is also probably going to keep several people away.

862
01:08:42,987 --> 01:08:49,111
[SPEAKER_04]: But the three of us have arranged plans with our significant others, so we will still be able to be here for the Valentine's Day show.

863
01:08:49,231 --> 01:08:50,432
[SPEAKER_04]: So look forward to that.

864
01:08:51,232 --> 01:08:53,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, or as some folks like to call it, Singles Awareness Day.

865
01:08:53,875 --> 01:08:56,418
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're single, come join the OLR family.

866
01:08:56,438 --> 01:08:58,561
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll make you feel right at home here and talk about games or something.

867
01:08:58,581 --> 01:09:01,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep your mind off of what Hallmark wants you to think about all day long.

868
01:09:02,465 --> 01:09:05,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow, let's get back into some gaming news, huh?

869
01:09:07,069 --> 01:09:09,870
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's do some quick, quick news stories, Loki.

870
01:09:10,131 --> 01:09:11,311
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, this is kind of cool.

871
01:09:11,971 --> 01:09:17,533
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, there will be a Heavy Rain demo coming out on PlayStation 3 soon.

872
01:09:17,593 --> 01:09:23,395
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not scheduled to come out until February 11th, but if you can't wait that long, you can actually download it now.

873
01:09:23,636 --> 01:09:27,177
[SPEAKER_11]: And the way you do this is participate in their alternate reality game.

874
01:09:27,597 --> 01:09:29,077
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

875
01:09:57,405 --> 01:10:09,293
[SPEAKER_11]: Precinct52.com and then you can just look for the four pieces of evidence which are the short cigarette marked 11117B the origami bird

876
01:10:14,477 --> 01:10:19,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Coffee Shop C, which you'll actually click on the one that says Diner on it.

877
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:23,622
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the Tire Tracks, it's 117H.

878
01:10:23,722 --> 01:10:25,703
[SPEAKER_11]: When you click on the Tire Tracks, it actually expands it out.

879
01:10:25,943 --> 01:10:26,683
[SPEAKER_11]: Same with the cigarettes.

880
01:10:26,724 --> 01:10:31,426
[SPEAKER_11]: You click on the picture of the cigarette and there'll be two different choices and choose 117B.

881
01:10:31,786 --> 01:10:38,530
[SPEAKER_11]: Once you've done all that, you'll receive a code to download the demo immediately, which is better than waiting until the 11th.

882
01:10:41,068 --> 01:10:41,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Other fun stuff.

883
01:10:42,009 --> 01:10:55,141
[SPEAKER_11]: Coming to the PlayStation Network, Fret Nice, which was a game... It's kind of a side-scroll platformer game that was actually a Flash game at one time that you played entirely with the Guitar Hero Rock Band controller.

884
01:10:55,721 --> 01:10:58,284
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, for whatever reason, they decided to go with this really...

885
01:10:59,545 --> 01:10:59,745
[SPEAKER_11]: and so on.

886
01:11:15,012 --> 01:11:17,353
[SPEAKER_11]: So, PlayStation 3 this week, though.

887
01:11:18,373 --> 01:11:31,717
[SPEAKER_11]: And then finally, Rock Band is getting some new download content, including... Well, tonight, actually, was the Who Super Bowl smash-up medley.

888
01:11:32,477 --> 01:11:37,178
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was available for $2, or $2 in whatever respective points you're spending.

889
01:11:40,839 --> 01:12:07,365
[SPEAKER_11]: Also this week will be another album as well, including Holy Wars, The Punishment Due, which is for also $2, Hanger 18, Take No Prisoners, Five Magics, Poison Was The Cure, Lucretia, Tornado Of Souls, Dawn Patrol, and Rest In Peace Polaris.

890
01:12:07,945 --> 01:12:10,686
[SPEAKER_11]: All those are available for $2 as well.

891
01:12:12,767 --> 01:12:16,609
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's, of course, off the Megadeth Hangar 18, I believe.

892
01:12:16,889 --> 01:12:18,930
[SPEAKER_11]: Or, no, Rust in Peace, if I'm not mistaken.

893
01:12:20,131 --> 01:12:23,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, I've got some more news for you guys for some other types of games.

894
01:12:23,592 --> 01:12:26,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Not music-based, but definitely a popular game folks are looking forward to.

895
01:12:26,934 --> 01:12:28,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Mod Nation Racers.

896
01:12:28,655 --> 01:12:30,415
[SPEAKER_04]: As you know, this game is coming out on the PlayStation 3.

897
01:12:31,116 --> 01:12:32,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have a time frame when that game's coming out?

898
01:12:32,676 --> 01:12:33,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that summer?

899
01:12:33,397 --> 01:12:35,958
[SPEAKER_11]: It got delayed again, so June as of right now.

900
01:12:36,178 --> 01:12:41,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, apparently, not only is there going to be a PlayStation 3 version, there's going to be a PSP version launching.

901
01:12:41,339 --> 01:12:42,059
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

902
01:12:42,419 --> 01:12:44,120
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I've never heard this news before.

903
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:45,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally new news.

904
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:52,161
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, just so you know, this game does have all the same tools that you'll find in the PS3 version, but of course the graphics are going to be scaled down a little bit.

905
01:12:52,441 --> 01:13:00,423
[SPEAKER_04]: But you still do get to make your own cars, your own racers, your own tracks, and you get to share them with the PSP Mod Nation community.

906
01:13:00,983 --> 01:13:03,884
[SPEAKER_04]: You get to go online with it and race and all that fun stuff.

907
01:13:05,224 --> 01:13:32,353
[SPEAKER_04]: PS3 and PSP versions launching side by side very similar to LittleBigPlanet of course also has the PS3 and PSP versions but there was about a year break between the two don't expect to see that same large window between these two releases again totally new news to me I hadn't heard this anywhere before hey Civ Network is a popular anticipated Facebook game at least at my house I'm really excited to play Civilization Network but not going to get a chance to tell June

908
01:13:32,853 --> 01:13:36,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's when the Civilization Network beta is apparently happening, is June.

909
01:13:36,754 --> 01:13:38,595
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

910
01:13:38,695 --> 01:13:41,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Variety, of all places, is the one that made this report.

911
01:13:41,476 --> 01:13:43,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Variety, the magazine usually talks about movies and TV.

912
01:13:43,997 --> 01:13:46,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they have to talk about games, too, when there's big stuff going on.

913
01:13:46,818 --> 01:13:50,679
[SPEAKER_04]: The beta for the new Facebook game, according to Variety, not starting until June.

914
01:13:51,139 --> 01:13:57,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, by the way, this game was initially announced back in October, and that they were going to do a beta tester hunt soon.

915
01:13:58,202 --> 01:14:00,543
[SPEAKER_04]: So soon means nine months.

916
01:14:01,944 --> 01:14:04,877
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, it's like saying, you know, I'm going to have a baby soon.

917
01:14:06,852 --> 01:14:33,744
[SPEAKER_04]: One other thing I got for you guys this week A game lots and lots of people are talking about Mass Effect 2 is obviously a hugely popular title this week And with good reason from what I understand I haven't played it myself But I hear it's pretty fucking epic One thing though that is not epic is the size of the text And if you're playing on a standard television You probably can't read it It's got the tiny text problem You know, you've heard about this in other games before It's not just Mass Effect 2 that's had this problem I want to say Lost Planet had this Some other games too

918
01:14:34,424 --> 01:14:39,307
[SPEAKER_04]: and usually companies patch this problem so that you can actually read these on an SDTV.

919
01:14:39,627 --> 01:14:40,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, guess what?

920
01:14:41,048 --> 01:14:50,132
[SPEAKER_04]: According to the project manager, Michael Gamble, let's see, quote, we understand that on some SDTVs, the smallest text in Mass Effect 2 can be difficult to read.

921
01:14:50,492 --> 01:14:54,915
[SPEAKER_04]: While this was not an intentional result, it was a byproduct of the enhancements to the user interface.

922
01:14:55,375 --> 01:15:01,418
[SPEAKER_04]: After investigating potential solutions, we have determined that while this issue does affect a small portion of SDTV owners,

923
01:15:01,858 --> 01:15:02,299
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

924
01:15:12,076 --> 01:15:14,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if you don't have a big team, you should just get one anyway, regardless.

925
01:15:16,958 --> 01:15:23,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the PSP Go is apparently getting a relaunch, even though the PSP Go is kind of crap anyway.

926
01:15:25,242 --> 01:15:30,924
[SPEAKER_09]: But Game Revision is saying that they're definitely going to have a relaunch and that there's going to be a price drop.

927
01:15:31,024 --> 01:15:32,505
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe that'll work.

928
01:15:32,565 --> 01:15:32,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

929
01:15:33,685 --> 01:15:34,626
[SPEAKER_09]: I still think it's crap.

930
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:47,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, for our DDR fans, DDR Universe 3, Dance Dance Revolution Universe 3 is on Xbox 360 games on demand.

931
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:50,815
[SPEAKER_09]: So, get your $30 ready if you want it.

932
01:15:51,716 --> 01:15:55,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Or save your money, because it was my least favorite of the Xbox 360 games.

933
01:15:56,505 --> 01:16:00,648
[SPEAKER_09]: And now, this is the thing that I actually bought a thousand cryptic points for.

934
01:16:01,409 --> 01:16:06,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that you can play a Ferengi or a Federation Klingon in Star Trek Online.

935
01:16:07,233 --> 01:16:11,136
[SPEAKER_09]: But, it's like, you have to pay so much.

936
01:16:11,356 --> 01:16:12,337
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, get this.

937
01:16:12,457 --> 01:16:17,480
[SPEAKER_09]: You pay 240 cryptic points for a Klingon, right?

938
01:16:17,901 --> 01:16:20,863
[SPEAKER_09]: You play 80 for a Ferengi.

939
01:16:20,883 --> 01:16:20,863
80. 80.

940
01:16:23,493 --> 01:16:24,154
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

941
01:16:41,078 --> 01:16:52,206
[SPEAKER_04]: I suppose WoW charges you for certain types of faction changes and so forth, but I can't think of anything that's locked out without having to spend more money, except, I suppose, actual expansion packs themselves.

942
01:16:52,266 --> 01:16:52,586
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

943
01:16:52,606 --> 01:16:58,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the one thing that I want them to do is to make some of the pre-order special stuff available for other people.

944
01:16:59,251 --> 01:17:04,515
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, for some reason, my Liberated Borg isn't showing up.

945
01:17:04,755 --> 01:17:09,038
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't tried looking in the thing again, but I haven't been able to make a Liberated Borg for my bridge crew.

946
01:17:10,353 --> 01:17:10,613
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh oh.

947
01:17:10,833 --> 01:17:12,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I need to find out where that is.

948
01:17:12,815 --> 01:17:18,058
[SPEAKER_09]: But I mean, I'm just saying that, you know, and the other thing too is that I bought more points so I could buy a third character slot.

949
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:20,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you only allowed two character slots?

950
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:21,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Two character slots.

951
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:23,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there multiple servers or is it just one giant server?

952
01:17:23,602 --> 01:17:24,362
[SPEAKER_09]: One big giant server.

953
01:17:24,422 --> 01:17:25,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wow, that's kind of cool.

954
01:17:25,223 --> 01:17:31,927
[SPEAKER_09]: But the big thing is they were having, if you buy a lifetime membership, then you can have, you start off with four slots.

955
01:17:32,708 --> 01:17:35,049
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you have the year one, you get like one more extra slot, I think.

956
01:17:35,149 --> 01:17:35,650
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know.

957
01:17:35,850 --> 01:17:39,092
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't, I don't have the money for a lifetime, although I'd pay for it.

958
01:17:40,170 --> 01:17:44,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Question from our chat room from Amaze Satsuma, chat.orangeloungeradio.com Do the female Ferengi wear clothes?

959
01:17:45,476 --> 01:17:53,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, they do, and there's an explanation for that, because keep in mind, all of our DS9 buddies out there, Ram's the Grand Nagus, and he brought in social reform.

960
01:17:54,886 --> 01:17:55,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to Twitter topics.

961
01:17:55,827 --> 01:17:56,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter topics.

962
01:17:58,484 --> 01:18:00,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week we invite you guys to send us your tweets.

963
01:18:00,766 --> 01:18:06,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Show us your tweets at username OLR and submit your topics for possible consideration to be read on the show.

964
01:18:07,190 --> 01:18:09,951
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a few of them tonight, so I don't think we're going to read all of these, but I'll read a few of these.

965
01:18:10,412 --> 01:18:15,355
[SPEAKER_04]: From PodCulture, Twitter topic, collector's editions of video games.

966
01:18:15,815 --> 01:18:16,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay or nay?

967
01:18:18,456 --> 01:18:20,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I say yay depending on what you're into.

968
01:18:20,778 --> 01:18:22,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the extras can be cool sometimes.

969
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:30,046
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets a little weird though when there's like really game changing items that are only available in the collector's edition.

970
01:18:30,386 --> 01:18:30,706
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

971
01:18:30,766 --> 01:18:32,388
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not cool to me.

972
01:18:32,908 --> 01:18:36,031
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean if it's a game I really like, sure I'm going to get the collector's edition.

973
01:18:36,051 --> 01:18:39,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if there's a Final Fantasy XIII collector's edition, I'm probably buying it.

974
01:18:40,354 --> 01:18:42,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, Collector's Editions, yay, nay.

975
01:18:42,235 --> 01:18:44,035
[SPEAKER_04]: It all depends what's in it and how much it's for.

976
01:18:44,055 --> 01:18:45,976
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even have to ask Jamie.

977
01:18:46,016 --> 01:18:48,037
[SPEAKER_04]: She's thumbing through her Star Trek Collector's Edition right now.

978
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:48,817
[SPEAKER_09]: It came with an art book.

979
01:18:48,957 --> 01:18:49,417
[SPEAKER_09]: It was cool.

980
01:18:49,477 --> 01:18:50,677
[SPEAKER_09]: And a pen.

981
01:18:50,818 --> 01:18:52,618
[SPEAKER_09]: And I get all kinds of cool stuff with it.

982
01:18:55,079 --> 01:19:01,321
[SPEAKER_09]: If there's something that I really, really like, and you know me and I love stuff, I will get the Collector's Edition.

983
01:19:03,693 --> 01:19:28,213
[SPEAKER_04]: going through some other tweets here Alex Carson interesting question I don't know if we're going to have much of an answer to this on Twitter what podcast do you guys like to tune into please tell me one of you guys likes Dignation here's the thing and I don't know if Loki and Jamie feel similarly but I don't listen to a lot of other podcasts because I don't want to be inadvertently influenced by what I hear on other shows like I'm all for you guys how John Tesh of you

984
01:19:28,793 --> 01:19:33,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm all for you guys listening to independent shows, and I think you should support other independent radio.

985
01:19:33,715 --> 01:19:39,217
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't want to hear something on one show and then inadvertently, without knowing, copy it.

986
01:19:39,237 --> 01:19:39,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that make sense?

987
01:19:40,117 --> 01:19:40,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

988
01:19:40,917 --> 01:19:42,898
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do support folks listening to other shows.

989
01:19:42,958 --> 01:19:43,598
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a few.

990
01:19:43,658 --> 01:19:44,478
[SPEAKER_04]: I've listened to more.

991
01:19:44,939 --> 01:19:49,480
[SPEAKER_04]: I drive to the Bay Area more often now because I date somebody that lives in the Bay Area, and it's about a two-hour drive.

992
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:51,801
[SPEAKER_04]: I have used podcasts to fill the gap.

993
01:19:52,301 --> 01:19:54,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me check with DarkSakura and Loki, though, first before I answer.

994
01:19:54,902 --> 01:19:56,242
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have a couple podcasts I like.

995
01:19:56,883 --> 01:19:57,923
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Loki, anything?

996
01:19:58,462 --> 01:20:17,946
[SPEAKER_09]: I was listening to the GrammarCast for a while and there are a couple more like a few classic gaming ones that I was you know listening to but for the most part I actually don't really have time you know I should set them up to download on my iPhone but I hardly ever forget to update my iPhone anyway

997
01:20:18,228 --> 01:20:18,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

998
01:20:18,609 --> 01:20:18,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki?

999
01:20:19,370 --> 01:20:21,253
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really listen to their podcasts.

1000
01:20:21,633 --> 01:20:24,297
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't at your work either because you're on the phone and stuff, right?

1001
01:20:24,377 --> 01:20:25,940
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know a lot of people listen to this at work.

1002
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:26,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm on the phone.

1003
01:20:26,661 --> 01:20:27,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Past the time.

1004
01:20:29,485 --> 01:20:33,811
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's not... I just don't because...

1005
01:20:35,327 --> 01:20:36,267
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, I just don't.

1006
01:20:37,088 --> 01:20:38,148
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have time.

1007
01:20:38,328 --> 01:20:40,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I probably have time during the day, but I just don't want to.

1008
01:20:43,470 --> 01:20:45,891
[SPEAKER_11]: Not that I don't think there's good stuff out there.

1009
01:20:46,691 --> 01:20:47,892
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't listen to the radio either.

1010
01:20:48,512 --> 01:20:58,856
[SPEAKER_11]: I listen to my CD player, or I guess MP3 player right now, that has like 10 songs on it, and I loop them, and I just don't care about adding new stuff to it.

1011
01:20:58,876 --> 01:21:00,877
[SPEAKER_11]: So same thing with podcasts, you know.

1012
01:21:02,137 --> 01:21:03,780
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, you know, I read the news.

1013
01:21:04,801 --> 01:21:12,731
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no, you know, for me, I'd probably listen to the game podcast and, you know, and I read news and stuff, so I don't really need to hear the news again.

1014
01:21:13,252 --> 01:21:17,277
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's just... Wait a minute, you just told people to basically not listen to this show.

1015
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:21,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, so be it, you know, whatever.

1016
01:21:21,823 --> 01:21:23,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just telling you why I don't listen to it.

1017
01:21:23,505 --> 01:21:30,173
[SPEAKER_04]: We like to talk about all the news too, not just, I mean, we try to report, like, usually we're not the ones breaking the news, but we talk about it.

1018
01:21:30,193 --> 01:21:36,481
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there's absolutely no news breaking here other than, oh my god, you know, Mod Nation Racers on PSP.

1019
01:21:38,563 --> 01:21:38,923
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1020
01:21:56,600 --> 01:22:18,492
[SPEAKER_04]: as far as video game podcasts go um i i don't know how far i want to say this like i have tried listening to a corporate oriented podcast um it was a very niche thing uh and i kind of find my found myself a little bit bored listening to it it was kind of a niche gaming podcast i kind of thought the hosts didn't have energy like they they didn't sound excited about what they were talking about it's kind of like

1021
01:22:19,107 --> 01:22:20,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello and welcome to our show.

1022
01:22:20,407 --> 01:22:22,408
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about this topic today.

1023
01:22:22,488 --> 01:22:24,528
[SPEAKER_02]: As hosted by Bob Ross?

1024
01:22:25,428 --> 01:22:25,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of.

1025
01:22:26,128 --> 01:22:32,990
[SPEAKER_04]: I shouldn't say negative things, but a lot of corp podcasts, like, dude, you're even paid to be there.

1026
01:22:33,070 --> 01:22:33,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, yeah, exactly.

1027
01:22:33,830 --> 01:22:34,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Be excited.

1028
01:22:34,530 --> 01:22:35,850
[SPEAKER_11]: That and the corporate podcasts, too.

1029
01:22:35,870 --> 01:22:40,431
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just like, hey, look at all these games that the game publishers just dumped on our desk with gold and money.

1030
01:22:40,451 --> 01:22:41,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at all this shit I get to play for free.

1031
01:22:41,891 --> 01:22:44,212
[SPEAKER_11]: They literally shove money into my pockets.

1032
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:46,052
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just like, oh, I hate that.

1033
01:22:46,192 --> 01:22:47,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1034
01:23:06,173 --> 01:23:08,034
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of them are such douches.

1035
01:23:08,154 --> 01:23:09,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, I'm not going to linger on the negative.

1036
01:23:09,595 --> 01:23:12,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me move to the positive because there are some indie podcasts I've listened to that I like.

1037
01:23:12,797 --> 01:23:15,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, I like Bobby's show, but clearly I'm biased.

1038
01:23:15,339 --> 01:23:17,240
[SPEAKER_04]: And Friday Night Gaming, I think, is a great show too.

1039
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually listen to, and I really like the show.

1040
01:23:19,981 --> 01:23:22,383
[SPEAKER_04]: I've listened to it like three times now on my drives to San Francisco.

1041
01:23:22,483 --> 01:23:23,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the Warcraft Outsiders.

1042
01:23:24,344 --> 01:23:29,128
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the spinoff of Video Game Outsiders, which is a show kind of similar to us.

1043
01:23:29,288 --> 01:23:35,693
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a girl and two guys who kind of drink and talk about the video game news, except they all do it on Skype.

1044
01:23:35,713 --> 01:23:38,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I think one of them is in Canada, and I think the others are on the East Coast somewhere.

1045
01:23:38,335 --> 01:23:41,157
[SPEAKER_04]: But they do a spinoff show about Warcraft, and I think it's pretty good.

1046
01:23:41,217 --> 01:23:44,099
[SPEAKER_04]: The girl leads it, and she's like a hardcore raider healer.

1047
01:23:44,119 --> 01:23:48,303
[SPEAKER_04]: I think her and her boyfriend play a lot, and I think they're pretty well informed of what they're talking about.

1048
01:23:48,383 --> 01:23:48,803
[SPEAKER_04]: It has energy.

1049
01:23:52,426 --> 01:23:54,368
[SPEAKER_04]: They enjoy what they're talking about.

1050
01:23:54,428 --> 01:23:59,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Although one guy on the show, kind of the running gag is that he doesn't really play Warcraft, so why is he there?

1051
01:23:59,352 --> 01:24:02,214
[SPEAKER_04]: But they make it funny, so it works.

1052
01:24:02,775 --> 01:24:04,216
[SPEAKER_04]: But they have energy.

1053
01:24:04,256 --> 01:24:08,219
[SPEAKER_04]: When she talks about her rating and stuff, you can tell she is having fun.

1054
01:24:08,259 --> 01:24:10,321
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's doing a show about something she really likes.

1055
01:24:10,401 --> 01:24:12,783
[SPEAKER_04]: And the guy, too, and the guest host.

1056
01:24:13,324 --> 01:24:16,526
[SPEAKER_04]: For those that want my opinion on what makes a good podcast...

1057
01:24:17,367 --> 01:24:19,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Have fun on what you're talking about.

1058
01:24:19,448 --> 01:24:22,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Make people want to listen to you because you are excited.

1059
01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:25,471
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to have energy on this show every week, even if I'm having a shit week.

1060
01:24:25,692 --> 01:24:30,874
[SPEAKER_09]: And don't forget, we've also got the comic podcast too that Mar and Marvel and I do.

1061
01:24:31,955 --> 01:24:32,555
[SPEAKER_09]: And we giggle!

1062
01:24:33,156 --> 01:24:33,816
[SPEAKER_09]: And are excited!

1063
01:24:35,393 --> 01:24:35,873
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

1064
01:24:38,035 --> 01:24:39,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's see.

1065
01:24:39,276 --> 01:24:42,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me move on to other comments on our Twitter.

1066
01:24:43,739 --> 01:24:51,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Spazinator says, latest rumor, Patrick Stewart is said to be a huge fan of handheld gaming, specifically on the N-Gage.

1067
01:24:52,385 --> 01:24:52,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it?

1068
01:24:53,579 --> 01:24:55,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, did I really just read that joke?

1069
01:24:55,240 --> 01:25:01,684
[SPEAKER_04]: See, let it not be said that we do not let every gamer have a voice, even when we should probably throw tomatoes at them.

1070
01:25:01,744 --> 01:25:02,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Waka waka waka!

1071
01:25:02,704 --> 01:25:07,587
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the bad joke of the week wouldn't be a good, or wouldn't be a bad idea, you know, that would be kind of funny.

1072
01:25:09,144 --> 01:25:11,505
[SPEAKER_04]: You get the OLR tomato award of the night, Spazinator.

1073
01:25:11,525 --> 01:25:12,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations.

1074
01:25:12,865 --> 01:25:14,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's one more Twitter question for you guys.

1075
01:25:14,326 --> 01:25:18,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Blue Swim asks us, any word on President Cat coming here?

1076
01:25:18,367 --> 01:25:18,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

1077
01:25:18,867 --> 01:25:19,147
[SPEAKER_04]: P.S.

1078
01:25:19,187 --> 01:25:22,188
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, I can have Mischief Makers as classic game of the week?

1079
01:25:23,348 --> 01:25:23,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

1080
01:25:24,728 --> 01:25:29,650
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as President Cat goes, we didn't hear anything after the whole little gauntlet of stuff that happened that week.

1081
01:25:32,111 --> 01:25:34,753
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's happening.

1082
01:25:34,973 --> 01:25:40,339
[SPEAKER_04]: There was the negative stories about that it only sold 100 copies, which I still say were bullshit.

1083
01:25:41,019 --> 01:25:43,922
[SPEAKER_04]: I fail to see how that was possible.

1084
01:25:43,982 --> 01:25:45,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe 100 copies were imported to the US.

1085
01:25:45,964 --> 01:25:47,445
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no way it sold 100 copies.

1086
01:25:47,465 --> 01:25:47,706
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1087
01:25:49,267 --> 01:25:55,696
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, even the crappiest of absolute shit that comes out on the Wii sells a lot of copies.

1088
01:25:55,976 --> 01:25:58,640
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why they release stuff on the Wii.

1089
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:02,425
[SPEAKER_11]: It's because people are like, hey, it's a game, it's cheap, let me buy it.

1090
01:26:02,945 --> 01:26:03,706
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it could be...

1091
01:26:06,030 --> 01:26:09,211
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, it could be a game about working at a call center or something.

1092
01:26:09,231 --> 01:26:14,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the Twitter account Renowe has still been kind of making posts as of late, so they're still kind of, you know, there.

1093
01:26:15,412 --> 01:26:16,972
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know.

1094
01:26:17,272 --> 01:26:20,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I think at this point I'm not holding my breath to see it released over here.

1095
01:26:20,653 --> 01:26:21,453
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, don't give up.

1096
01:26:21,513 --> 01:26:23,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Continue to follow it and send them tweets.

1097
01:26:24,193 --> 01:26:33,295
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the best case scenario at this point is that someone kind of caught wind of this whole thing going on and maybe we'll see a game like President Cat.

1098
01:26:34,275 --> 01:26:40,857
[SPEAKER_04]: But remember, there's a certain charm that President Cat had, and when you make a copy of a copy, the quality declines.

1099
01:26:41,017 --> 01:26:48,100
[SPEAKER_04]: So just be very thoughtful in how you do that if you are said publisher listening right now thinking about cashing in on the President Cat craze.

1100
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:50,821
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, again, it would sell.

1101
01:26:51,201 --> 01:26:51,481
[SPEAKER_04]: It would.

1102
01:26:52,844 --> 01:26:56,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get back into some long-form gaming news.

1103
01:26:56,307 --> 01:26:58,609
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll read more of your tweets next week at twitter.com.

1104
01:26:59,350 --> 01:27:00,411
[SPEAKER_04]: The mailbag's coming up, though.

1105
01:27:00,431 --> 01:27:03,994
[SPEAKER_04]: I know DarkSakura's going to tear into that in just a moment, but we do have some news before we get there, Loki.

1106
01:27:04,194 --> 01:27:04,354
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1107
01:27:05,475 --> 01:27:11,320
[SPEAKER_11]: You may remember that there was a—well, there's been a few knockoff Wii systems out there.

1108
01:27:11,621 --> 01:27:16,085
[SPEAKER_11]: One of them was Zone 40, which was just some, like—

1109
01:27:17,515 --> 01:27:24,362
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks sort of like a Wii, but not quite, you know, and it had, you know, 40 little mini-games.

1110
01:27:24,422 --> 01:27:40,497
[SPEAKER_11]: Well now, they have the officially licensed Sega Zone, which has 20 Genesis Classic games and 30 new games, 16 of which are playable with the devices, two wireless motion controllers, and, um...

1111
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:46,660
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and it's in wonderful black and blue with the Sega logo on the side.

1112
01:27:47,941 --> 01:27:50,182
[SPEAKER_11]: Trying to see what games are in there.

1113
01:27:50,802 --> 01:27:52,142
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of hard to see.

1114
01:27:52,242 --> 01:27:53,042
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wait, here we go.

1115
01:27:53,223 --> 01:27:54,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me guess, Sonic the Hedgehog?

1116
01:27:54,723 --> 01:27:56,083
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Sonic the Hedgehog, yes.

1117
01:27:56,143 --> 01:27:57,624
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's, you know...

1118
01:27:58,164 --> 01:27:59,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, obvious.

1119
01:27:59,545 --> 01:28:07,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, looks like Alex Kidd, Sonic & Knuckles, uh, Columns 3, E-SWAT, Echo the Dolphin, Golden Axe.

1120
01:28:07,131 --> 01:28:09,873
[SPEAKER_04]: The same shit that's in every Sega compilation, basically.

1121
01:28:10,033 --> 01:28:14,817
[SPEAKER_11]: Then, like, some of the other, uh, like, arcade games that they have, uh...

1122
01:28:16,693 --> 01:28:19,014
[SPEAKER_11]: I think a lot of this is just some generic stuff.

1123
01:28:19,054 --> 01:28:20,835
[SPEAKER_11]: Like they have what looks like a boxing game.

1124
01:28:20,855 --> 01:28:22,456
[SPEAKER_11]: Looks like Wii Boxing or something.

1125
01:28:22,656 --> 01:28:24,137
[SPEAKER_04]: I can actually see the little picture here.

1126
01:28:24,177 --> 01:28:25,297
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a blown up version of it.

1127
01:28:25,618 --> 01:28:28,639
[SPEAKER_04]: E-SWAT, Sonic Spinball, Golden Axe, Shinobi.

1128
01:28:29,019 --> 01:28:32,861
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in the Sega games section, they have Cannon.

1129
01:28:33,181 --> 01:28:37,163
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, no, that's the 14 arcade games section right below that.

1130
01:28:37,203 --> 01:28:38,864
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Balls is one of them.

1131
01:28:38,884 --> 01:28:39,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I see, I see.

1132
01:28:40,425 --> 01:28:42,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Bomber, Cannon...

1133
01:28:43,539 --> 01:28:44,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I see that.

1134
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:46,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Some bottle caps race or something.

1135
01:28:47,005 --> 01:28:54,297
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like they basically just copied over some of the crappy games that were on there and put some Sega Genesis games on there.

1136
01:28:56,008 --> 01:28:57,609
[SPEAKER_04]: And then some interactive sports games.

1137
01:28:57,629 --> 01:28:57,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.

1138
01:28:57,889 --> 01:29:01,050
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Wii Sports, but with 16 different games, including darts, I see.

1139
01:29:02,371 --> 01:29:02,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1140
01:29:03,291 --> 01:29:03,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that curling?

1141
01:29:04,531 --> 01:29:05,092
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it is.

1142
01:29:06,092 --> 01:29:07,933
[SPEAKER_11]: It would all depend on what the price is.

1143
01:29:08,033 --> 01:29:15,276
[SPEAKER_11]: And it says, I guess it's priced at 39.95 euros, I believe.

1144
01:29:18,457 --> 01:29:19,037
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, though.

1145
01:29:19,077 --> 01:29:22,959
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's cute, but I think I'll pass on that.

1146
01:29:24,153 --> 01:29:31,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, I don't know how I feel about these games, but Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy, you know these games.

1147
01:29:31,261 --> 01:29:40,911
[SPEAKER_04]: They're actually, I believe they're like Sony Pictures Entertainment game shows, but THQ has actually licensed the franchises to make video games based on them.

1148
01:29:41,011 --> 01:29:45,736
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's not like it would be the first time ever a video game has been made out of Wheel of Fortune or Jeopardy.

1149
01:29:45,936 --> 01:29:51,218
[SPEAKER_11]: But it would be awesome if they were, I don't know, one of the Xbox, you know.

1150
01:29:51,298 --> 01:29:52,858
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm saying.

1151
01:29:52,918 --> 01:30:02,921
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where I was going to go with this is that wouldn't that be cool if they actually, I mean, to make these games more fun, did the whole like 1 versus 100 route and made them like a little more interactive like that?

1152
01:30:03,021 --> 01:30:06,982
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously, 1 versus 100 is awesome and everything, but it's starting to get old.

1153
01:30:07,923 --> 01:30:11,944
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, I thought there was supposed to be more than just one game on there.

1154
01:30:13,104 --> 01:30:18,107
[SPEAKER_11]: And honestly, I've never played 1 vs. 100 on Xbox Live.

1155
01:30:18,668 --> 01:30:19,228
[SPEAKER_12]: It's fun-ish.

1156
01:30:20,048 --> 01:30:20,689
[SPEAKER_12]: Dan likes it.

1157
01:30:20,869 --> 01:30:24,171
[SPEAKER_04]: I was number one one night on Video Game Trivia halfway through.

1158
01:30:24,211 --> 01:30:24,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I finally missed.

1159
01:30:24,991 --> 01:30:26,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I had a 26-question streak.

1160
01:30:27,153 --> 01:30:29,734
[SPEAKER_04]: And at one of the breaks, I was number one on the leaderboard.

1161
01:30:29,774 --> 01:30:31,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I took a picture and posted it on Twitter and everything.

1162
01:30:31,375 --> 01:30:32,776
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked about it a few weeks ago on the show.

1163
01:30:33,857 --> 01:30:35,678
[SPEAKER_04]: But sadly, yeah, I finally failed.

1164
01:30:35,718 --> 01:30:39,540
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the question I failed on was... Oh, I remember it was the ESRB rating.

1165
01:30:39,620 --> 01:30:41,241
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the ESRB rating for Worms 2?

1166
01:30:41,881 --> 01:30:42,362
[SPEAKER_04]: I got it wrong.

1167
01:30:43,042 --> 01:31:09,746
[SPEAKER_04]: but anyway it's fun playing the Xbox Live one can be fun but yeah I get what you're saying though it does get old a lot of these game show things get old but if there was that variety I think it could be pretty cool especially like Jeopardy, Wheel of Fortune I think these could be cool games to do live you know with the whole like I don't think everybody would just watch three players but maybe if everybody got you know how like 1 vs 100 splits you up into parties of four

1168
01:31:10,006 --> 01:31:10,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1169
01:31:10,546 --> 01:31:25,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe if these games did that, split you up into random parties of three, and you played a predetermined puzzle or predetermined set of questions, and then you can see maybe at the end who out of all the matches was like the top, who got the big, big score.

1170
01:31:25,817 --> 01:31:26,977
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's ways you could do it.

1171
01:31:27,017 --> 01:31:27,918
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it'd make it fun.

1172
01:31:28,538 --> 01:31:28,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1173
01:31:28,659 --> 01:31:30,820
[SPEAKER_04]: But sadly, I don't think THQ is going to be doing that.

1174
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:31,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Because guess what?

1175
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:35,623
[SPEAKER_04]: They're actually going to be releasing them specifically on the Wii and the DS.

1176
01:31:36,644 --> 01:31:36,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1177
01:31:36,904 --> 01:31:39,326
[SPEAKER_04]: So, in other words, get ready to spin the wheel with your Wiimote.

1178
01:31:40,026 --> 01:31:45,951
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're going to be as bad as successful as The Price is Right and the other games that came out, which were not very much.

1179
01:31:45,971 --> 01:31:48,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I heard Press Your Luck and Price is Right weren't that bad.

1180
01:31:49,193 --> 01:31:52,316
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, later this year is when those first games are coming out.

1181
01:31:52,636 --> 01:31:59,081
[SPEAKER_04]: The statement, by the way, about these games came from the THQ Kids, Family, and Casual Games executive VP.

1182
01:31:59,222 --> 01:32:02,084
[SPEAKER_04]: So no hardcore Wheel of Fortune for you.

1183
01:32:03,895 --> 01:32:04,736
[SPEAKER_04]: I am sorry to say.

1184
01:32:05,336 --> 01:32:08,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I really wish they would go the live game show route though on Xbox Live.

1185
01:32:08,619 --> 01:32:09,860
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope we do get some more of those.

1186
01:32:10,660 --> 01:32:11,341
[SPEAKER_04]: I really do.

1187
01:32:11,621 --> 01:32:13,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Wouldn't it be cool to actually have a live Press Your Luck?

1188
01:32:14,443 --> 01:32:15,404
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love that!

1189
01:32:15,524 --> 01:32:16,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a live... Old school.

1190
01:32:16,885 --> 01:32:18,266
[SPEAKER_04]: A live Price is Right.

1191
01:32:18,326 --> 01:32:21,569
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, imagine you could be in the audience with your little avatar.

1192
01:32:21,629 --> 01:32:22,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Higher, higher, lower.

1193
01:32:22,850 --> 01:32:23,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Have your little Plinko party.

1194
01:32:23,971 --> 01:32:24,491
[SPEAKER_09]: Plinko party.

1195
01:32:25,890 --> 01:32:53,693
[SPEAKER_09]: there's so much more that can be done and I hope it is done well how about something that's good news for a lot of people there's Fallout New Vegas will be out summer 2010 there's actually a trailer up and everything it's being developed by Obsidian Entertainment the same people that gave us Knights of the Old Republic 2 Neverwinter Knights 2 and this is going to be a direct follow up to Fallout 3

1196
01:32:55,396 --> 01:32:56,117
[SPEAKER_11]: It looked kind of neat.

1197
01:32:57,678 --> 01:32:58,858
[SPEAKER_08]: I just know a lot of people like Fallout.

1198
01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:01,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, Fallout's a hugely popular game, especially number three.

1199
01:33:02,301 --> 01:33:03,601
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of those games I have yet to play.

1200
01:33:03,641 --> 01:33:05,903
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in my little rental queue, but I haven't gotten the game yet.

1201
01:33:07,684 --> 01:33:09,065
[SPEAKER_04]: But I hear it's Oblivion with guns.

1202
01:33:09,365 --> 01:33:10,466
[SPEAKER_04]: But so much came out.

1203
01:33:10,686 --> 01:33:13,108
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have time to play every single video game.

1204
01:33:13,508 --> 01:33:16,450
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'll try to get around to it, at least before Final Fantasy XIII comes out.

1205
01:33:16,470 --> 01:33:18,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when that comes out, yeah.

1206
01:33:18,431 --> 01:33:19,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm worried about that.

1207
01:33:20,012 --> 01:33:21,913
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not really going to be playing anything else for a while.

1208
01:33:23,334 --> 01:33:24,135
[SPEAKER_04]: I know myself.

1209
01:33:26,148 --> 01:33:26,849
[SPEAKER_11]: So sad.

1210
01:33:27,609 --> 01:33:29,370
[SPEAKER_11]: All these games.

1211
01:33:30,291 --> 01:33:31,632
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is kind of interesting.

1212
01:33:32,912 --> 01:33:41,538
[SPEAKER_11]: You may remember back we talked a little bit about how Walmart and Best Buy were kind of getting into this kiosk trade-in type of business.

1213
01:33:42,578 --> 01:33:49,563
[SPEAKER_11]: They were going to be able to buy, sell, trade games, also rent out games, and I believe DVDs as well.

1214
01:33:50,583 --> 01:33:57,725
[SPEAKER_11]: Problem is, though, the company behind it, Eplay, has ceased operations.

1215
01:33:58,406 --> 01:34:07,969
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't know if that means closing or out of business or whatever, but they're no longer operating, if you will.

1216
01:34:08,989 --> 01:34:12,110
[SPEAKER_11]: So unfortunately, that will probably go away.

1217
01:34:13,130 --> 01:34:15,531
[SPEAKER_11]: which is too bad because I hear that their trading values are pretty good.

1218
01:34:17,492 --> 01:34:27,035
[SPEAKER_11]: Not true though if you're doing that in Canada because I believe actually in Canada Best Buy actually handles their trade-ins in the store and not through a kiosk so that's kind of cool.

1219
01:34:28,435 --> 01:34:40,666
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, GameCrazy, apparently the parent company, Movie Gallery, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy again.

1220
01:34:41,406 --> 01:34:48,672
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're only basically going to drop it down to only 250 GameCrazy locations once they're done.

1221
01:34:49,313 --> 01:34:52,776
[SPEAKER_11]: And be liquidating close to 760 stores.

1222
01:34:54,477 --> 01:34:55,338
[SPEAKER_08]: I can vouch for that.

1223
01:34:56,237 --> 01:34:58,640
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot of depressing news in the retail world.

1224
01:34:58,901 --> 01:34:59,201
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1225
01:34:59,522 --> 01:35:00,944
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's something that hits home here.

1226
01:35:01,324 --> 01:35:02,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sure, I'm sure.

1227
01:35:02,165 --> 01:35:04,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know yet if everything's going to be okay?

1228
01:35:04,428 --> 01:35:07,212
[SPEAKER_08]: We're thinking that the Cameron Park store is going to be okay.

1229
01:35:07,473 --> 01:35:07,853
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

1230
01:35:08,774 --> 01:35:09,015
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1231
01:35:09,035 --> 01:35:09,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, good luck.

1232
01:35:09,495 --> 01:35:10,497
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope everything turns out all right.

1233
01:35:10,717 --> 01:35:11,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Me too.

1234
01:35:11,098 --> 01:35:12,419
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I like living in a house.

1235
01:35:14,056 --> 01:35:15,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, on to happier news.

1236
01:35:15,638 --> 01:35:20,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the comments in chat still talking about the whole ideas of game shows on Xbox Live.

1237
01:35:21,386 --> 01:35:26,513
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think SSJ100Matt totally has the winner idea of what game should be on Xbox Live.

1238
01:35:26,793 --> 01:35:27,154
[SPEAKER_04]: You ready?

1239
01:35:35,306 --> 01:35:35,686
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, yes.

1240
01:35:35,947 --> 01:35:36,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, yes, the match game.

1241
01:35:38,268 --> 01:35:41,911
[SPEAKER_04]: If only they could find a way to bring back Brett Summers and Charles Nelson Reilly from the dead.

1242
01:35:41,931 --> 01:35:44,092
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be amazing.

1243
01:35:44,472 --> 01:35:45,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of a sad face news.

1244
01:35:45,693 --> 01:35:47,234
[SPEAKER_04]: You know I'm big on LiveJournal, right?

1245
01:35:47,314 --> 01:35:57,661
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my good friends that I've had on LiveJournal for years now ran a community on LiveJournal called Match Game LJ, which, you know, kind of did like a little LiveJournal version of the match game every week.

1246
01:35:57,681 --> 01:36:01,344
[SPEAKER_04]: He decided to close it down this week, and he's not going to be running it anymore.

1247
01:36:01,404 --> 01:36:02,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me sad face.

1248
01:36:03,205 --> 01:36:04,926
[SPEAKER_04]: So what up, Mark, if you're listening, although I doubt he is.

1249
01:36:06,046 --> 01:36:07,587
[SPEAKER_04]: But yes, Match Game should be on Xbox Live.

1250
01:36:07,727 --> 01:36:08,407
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be wonderful.

1251
01:36:09,807 --> 01:36:10,267
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love that.

1252
01:36:11,048 --> 01:36:12,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, on to some other news.

1253
01:36:12,768 --> 01:36:16,369
[SPEAKER_04]: This is definitely kind of an eyebrow-raising piece here from Harmonix.

1254
01:36:16,829 --> 01:36:26,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Harmonix has apparently done some more licensing, and this really isn't a big surprise when you consider, oh yeah, duh, Harmonix makes music games, and you know, they license stuff for Rock Band 2 all of the time.

1255
01:36:27,292 --> 01:36:30,833
[SPEAKER_04]: But look at some of the things they've been licensing lately.

1256
01:36:30,873 --> 01:36:32,674
[SPEAKER_04]: This is all from the Royalty Network.

1257
01:36:32,714 --> 01:36:34,014
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess some people were watching there.

1258
01:36:34,574 --> 01:36:45,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Anteup by M.O.P., Say Ah by Trey Songs, Evacuate the Dance Floor by Cascada, The Way I Are by Timbaland featuring D.O.E.

1259
01:36:45,665 --> 01:36:48,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are all like dancey poppy songs.

1260
01:36:48,707 --> 01:36:50,449
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't belong in rock band.

1261
01:36:51,210 --> 01:36:51,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do they?

1262
01:36:52,411 --> 01:36:55,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Or what is going on at Camp Harmonix?

1263
01:36:55,994 --> 01:36:56,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

1264
01:36:57,182 --> 01:36:58,582
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Heroish Game in the Works DDR

1265
01:37:17,188 --> 01:37:17,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1266
01:37:36,784 --> 01:37:39,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I've got to admit, you know what I'm tempted to say?

1267
01:37:40,167 --> 01:37:42,609
[SPEAKER_04]: My gut tells me it's a dance game.

1268
01:37:43,110 --> 01:37:48,295
[SPEAKER_04]: That they're going to try to take the dance game crown from Konami and now's a pretty good time.

1269
01:37:49,035 --> 01:37:49,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly.

1270
01:37:50,617 --> 01:37:51,257
[SPEAKER_04]: They could do it.

1271
01:37:53,399 --> 01:37:54,320
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, what do you guys think?

1272
01:37:56,202 --> 01:37:56,342
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

1273
01:37:58,149 --> 01:38:00,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, this is a topic that hits home here at OLR.

1274
01:38:00,391 --> 01:38:01,692
[SPEAKER_04]: This show started over DDR.

1275
01:38:01,712 --> 01:38:04,734
[SPEAKER_11]: The dance genre is really that popular anymore.

1276
01:38:04,774 --> 01:38:11,879
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I guess you've seen a couple titles that are really kind of stand out now, but they're a little bit different than DDR.

1277
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:16,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Just Dance is a title that I'm surprised is doing okay.

1278
01:38:16,683 --> 01:38:22,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I have some co-workers, and I always talk about co-workers because that's my way to gauge the casual gamer.

1279
01:38:23,568 --> 01:38:52,394
[SPEAKER_04]: some of my co-workers that I would not imagine played a lot of Nintendo Wii love Just Dance and think it's like great and I've heard some people on the show talking highly about it too some of our chatters and stuff apparently it's this big cult music game that's doing very well culty type I gotta play it at some point but anyway sorry what was the rest of your thought there no I'm just surprised that you know that's doing well so I'm not sure if they would be going like that route though

1280
01:38:54,598 --> 01:38:58,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Frisbee in our chatroom says, Konami doesn't have the crown, Stepmania does.

1281
01:38:58,919 --> 01:39:04,501
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to say this and rip it off like a band-aid here and just kind of give you my thought here.

1282
01:39:04,781 --> 01:39:06,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Stepmania is not legitimate.

1283
01:39:07,042 --> 01:39:11,783
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that probably sucks to hear, and I know it's got a big community and everything, but it's not legitimate.

1284
01:39:12,475 --> 01:39:38,854
[SPEAKER_04]: neither is in the groove do you well in the groove is a step above step mania in the groove was the way to try and legitimize step mania but let me put it this way you do not walk into a GameStop and buy step mania over the counter or do you really buy step mania at all I mean it's just not it's not the same step mania was always there to emulate DDR and then yeah they tried to kind of innovate it later especially within the groove and so forth but it's not I mean I could see Harmonix doing what Konami should have done

1285
01:39:39,454 --> 01:39:46,440
[SPEAKER_04]: about six years ago and reinventing DDR from the ground up, which supposedly is also happening by Konami right now.

1286
01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:50,563
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't heard what's up with that DDR game they're supposed to be putting out with eight panels.

1287
01:39:50,944 --> 01:39:52,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't that supposed to be out last Christmas?

1288
01:39:52,285 --> 01:39:53,105
[SPEAKER_04]: It got delayed.

1289
01:39:54,346 --> 01:40:01,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was supposed to be actually out this spring, and it still hasn't been released yet.

1290
01:40:01,332 --> 01:40:04,315
[SPEAKER_11]: I think probably the second quarter.

1291
01:40:04,975 --> 01:40:07,996
[SPEAKER_11]: But even still, it's just, I can't get excited about it.

1292
01:40:08,436 --> 01:40:14,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch, I go to DDRFreak.com and let's see, do I see anything about the new DDR game?

1293
01:40:14,997 --> 01:40:25,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, DDR Freak, Pump It Up Pro 2, Step Mania the Manga, DJ Hero Deal, Cobalt Flux, back in November, $40 Amazon credit with various hero bundles, yeah.

1294
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:28,681
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no news on DDR and even DDR Freak.

1295
01:40:28,801 --> 01:40:33,603
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that is a sign about how Konami has fumbled and dropped the DDR crown.

1296
01:40:33,683 --> 01:40:39,585
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if Harmonix were to show up at E3 with a new dance game with... I hate to say it, guys.

1297
01:40:39,625 --> 01:40:54,751
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I'm going to piss some of you off with this comment, but without the J-pop and the stuff that most people on this side of the ocean don't know, but stuff like Timberland and Cascada and people actually recognize from clubs, Harmonix is going to... They're going to do to DDR what they did to Guitar Hero.

1298
01:40:56,051 --> 01:40:58,392
[SPEAKER_04]: or Guitar Freaks, sorry, with Guitar Hero.

1299
01:40:59,172 --> 01:41:00,113
[SPEAKER_04]: That could be what we're looking at.

1300
01:41:00,593 --> 01:41:01,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we'll just have to wait and see.

1301
01:41:02,173 --> 01:41:05,695
[SPEAKER_04]: And it could be that Rock Band 3, I mean, again, this is all speculation.

1302
01:41:05,855 --> 01:41:10,537
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why my gut just tells me Konami's vulnerable right now.

1303
01:41:10,877 --> 01:41:17,259
[SPEAKER_04]: If DDR Freak can't even tell you the latest on what's going on with 8-panel DDR and this whole reinvention of the franchise, I mean, hello.

1304
01:41:17,980 --> 01:41:18,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Something is wrong.

1305
01:41:20,681 --> 01:41:20,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

1306
01:41:21,421 --> 01:41:21,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1307
01:41:21,601 --> 01:41:21,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1308
01:41:22,208 --> 01:41:24,350
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we technically do have 8-panel DDR, Rob.

1309
01:41:25,331 --> 01:41:25,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Doubles.

1310
01:41:26,472 --> 01:41:27,353
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm talking about.

1311
01:41:27,433 --> 01:41:28,254
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I know.

1312
01:41:28,314 --> 01:41:30,075
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, just like quad mode.

1313
01:41:30,415 --> 01:41:31,476
[SPEAKER_11]: Did that ever catch on?

1314
01:41:31,717 --> 01:41:32,077
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1315
01:41:32,918 --> 01:41:35,760
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTetsuya is saying, So, Rob, are you saying DDR is dead?

1316
01:41:37,742 --> 01:41:38,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Well... Yes.

1317
01:41:38,643 --> 01:41:38,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1318
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:41,302
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of died about five years ago.

1319
01:41:42,563 --> 01:41:46,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Around the time this show stopped talking about DDR was kind of when it was starting to die.

1320
01:41:46,286 --> 01:41:52,272
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate to say it, but I don't think it'll ever die, but it's not what it was ten years ago.

1321
01:41:53,313 --> 01:41:53,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's face it.

1322
01:41:54,814 --> 01:41:55,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Reality check.

1323
01:41:57,442 --> 01:42:03,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, hey, let's get into some more pleasant topics and talk a little bit about what is going on in our email bag.

1324
01:42:03,846 --> 01:42:16,915
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, every week we invite you guys to send us emails to our email address at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and every week DarkSakura likes to tear the mail bag open and read some of her favorite emails for us to respond to here on the show.

1325
01:42:18,246 --> 01:42:22,289
[SPEAKER_04]: So DarkSakura, dive into the mailbag and tell us what emails are we getting this week?

1326
01:42:22,529 --> 01:42:23,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we got one recent.

1327
01:42:23,710 --> 01:42:26,573
[SPEAKER_09]: It was one of the ones that were deleted when I was getting rid of the spam.

1328
01:42:28,054 --> 01:42:29,155
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll go ahead and read it first.

1329
01:42:29,675 --> 01:42:31,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, OLR crew, AZHP here.

1330
01:42:31,416 --> 01:42:38,162
[SPEAKER_09]: I was listening to your podcast from the 10th and heard Jamie brush off the Rockstar forced overtime deal because they would get time and a half.

1331
01:42:38,642 --> 01:42:45,868
[SPEAKER_09]: I work in the programming industry as well and I can tell you with 100% certainty that pretty much no one in the entire industry in California gets paid a cent of overtime.

1332
01:42:46,548 --> 01:42:57,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Furthermore, and this is generally the norm for the games industry in general, employees are forced to work 12 hours, 6-7 days a week, with no overtime pay, no compensation for PTO, no bonuses, and sometimes even no vacation.

1333
01:42:57,956 --> 01:43:00,557
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, PTO is paid time off for those who don't speak office speak.

1334
01:43:01,678 --> 01:43:03,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes even no vacation after a project is finished.

1335
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:07,822
[SPEAKER_09]: There are also generally threats of dismissal if one does not go into work.

1336
01:43:08,243 --> 01:43:16,328
[SPEAKER_09]: These people are so fatigued getting one or zero days off that week, they make more and more mistakes, and they have to stay even longer to fix them.

1337
01:43:16,748 --> 01:43:22,334
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a law in California that says you can be exempt from getting paid overtime if you make more than $90,000 in a year.

1338
01:43:22,974 --> 01:43:25,337
[SPEAKER_09]: However, game developers generally make about half that.

1339
01:43:26,017 --> 01:43:31,162
[SPEAKER_09]: It might seem like a decent salary, but when you're working 100 hour work weeks, it equates to about $14 an hour.

1340
01:43:35,246 --> 01:43:37,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you might say, take it up with the law or quit.

1341
01:43:37,468 --> 01:43:40,571
[SPEAKER_09]: However, these people are so overworked that they don't have the time to file a lawsuit.

1342
01:43:41,031 --> 01:43:50,940
[SPEAKER_09]: And getting into the industry is so hard because there are so few studios owned by even fewer publishers that it's 100 times harder to get a job in the games industry than it is any other job, especially in our economic climate.

1343
01:43:51,540 --> 01:43:55,685
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry for the lengthy rant, but I was appalled at the complacency of the crew on reporting on this story.

1344
01:43:55,985 --> 01:44:02,492
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted everyone to know the true nature of the beast so that they could understand what most game developers go through to bring you the games you love to play.

1345
01:44:02,692 --> 01:44:04,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Yours truly, AZHPPS.

1346
01:44:04,214 --> 01:44:06,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry about the terrible Silent Hill joke last time.

1347
01:44:06,456 --> 01:44:06,977
[SPEAKER_09]: I just had to.

1348
01:44:07,677 --> 01:44:12,362
[SPEAKER_09]: My point is that it's because no one says anything that this shit continues.

1349
01:44:13,644 --> 01:44:36,504
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of I sort of agree like I don't I don't want to say I'm complacent with this I mean it does strike me as very wrong but at the same time I feel like I don't know enough about that perspective because most of the people I know that work for developers aren't making these same complaints and I don't know if it's because of and it's addressing that email the fear of if they speak up they're going to get fired but if everything that's in that email is true that's bullshit

1350
01:44:37,265 --> 01:44:47,590
[SPEAKER_04]: of course it's bullshit and maybe the wives should be speaking up and somebody has got to stand up for these people and put a stop to this by the way though you don't have to make $90,000 a year to be exempt from overtime trust me I know

1351
01:44:48,058 --> 01:44:54,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, if you are an exempt employee, then your overtime is counted in other ways.

1352
01:44:55,262 --> 01:44:57,223
[SPEAKER_04]: There are still boundaries.

1353
01:44:58,663 --> 01:45:04,646
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like to talk a lot about my day job because I don't want to ever jeopardize that here on the show, but I will say these few key things.

1354
01:45:04,747 --> 01:45:13,271
[SPEAKER_04]: I am an exempt employee where I work, but anytime I do have to work those extra hours, my company is very good about balancing it out.

1355
01:45:13,551 --> 01:45:15,352
[SPEAKER_09]: You get basically comped time, right?

1356
01:45:15,872 --> 01:45:16,473
[SPEAKER_04]: In a way.

1357
01:45:16,513 --> 01:45:22,460
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I should reveal those types of things on the show, but there are ways they make up for it, and I don't feel overworked.

1358
01:45:22,820 --> 01:45:24,422
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody should have that privilege.

1359
01:45:24,442 --> 01:45:28,867
[SPEAKER_09]: I've had times at my job where they say, oh, we've got mandatory overtime this weekend, and I'm like, I'm not coming.

1360
01:45:29,928 --> 01:45:30,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not?

1361
01:45:31,751 --> 01:45:32,351
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not coming.

1362
01:45:32,511 --> 01:45:33,412
[SPEAKER_09]: I have other things to do.

1363
01:45:33,913 --> 01:45:34,534
[SPEAKER_09]: I made plans.

1364
01:45:34,874 --> 01:45:35,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I'm not coming.

1365
01:45:36,856 --> 01:45:38,137
[SPEAKER_09]: And they'll be like, well, okay.

1366
01:45:38,217 --> 01:45:41,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they cannot make you work mandatory overtime.

1367
01:45:42,460 --> 01:45:46,082
[SPEAKER_09]: They just say mandatory because they're strongly suggesting it.

1368
01:45:46,102 --> 01:45:47,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they need to have the people there.

1369
01:45:47,903 --> 01:45:50,605
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe it's mandatory for them to request the overtime.

1370
01:45:51,365 --> 01:45:53,267
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's not mandatory that you take it.

1371
01:45:53,807 --> 01:45:56,929
[SPEAKER_09]: That you, you know, go in and work on your day off.

1372
01:45:57,429 --> 01:45:58,450
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a law for a reason.

1373
01:45:59,450 --> 01:46:02,873
[SPEAKER_09]: And if, I'm sorry, I really don't feel very sorry for these people who...

1374
01:46:05,206 --> 01:46:07,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, okay.

1375
01:46:07,108 --> 01:46:08,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, no, I don't feel sorry.

1376
01:46:08,429 --> 01:46:11,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, yeah, it sucks that they're having such a hard time.

1377
01:46:11,611 --> 01:46:16,835
[SPEAKER_09]: But as long as they're not doing anything to change it, you know, then they're just adding to the problem.

1378
01:46:17,355 --> 01:46:18,076
[SPEAKER_09]: They're adding to the problem.

1379
01:46:18,096 --> 01:46:19,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe that's why the wives are speaking up.

1380
01:46:19,517 --> 01:46:26,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe people, I mean, I can see what he's saying in the email there about there is a very real fear that if I speak up, I'm going to be fired.

1381
01:46:26,702 --> 01:46:27,463
[SPEAKER_04]: I could see that.

1382
01:46:27,843 --> 01:46:28,563
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's illegal.

1383
01:46:28,663 --> 01:46:30,545
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a tough industry to crack into.

1384
01:46:30,565 --> 01:46:30,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1385
01:46:30,805 --> 01:46:33,668
[SPEAKER_09]: But it still doesn't change the fact of what the law is.

1386
01:46:33,948 --> 01:46:37,671
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to get too political here, but is it... Just throwing ideas out there.

1387
01:46:38,092 --> 01:46:44,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it possible that there could be a union of developers and people that work in the game industry?

1388
01:46:44,798 --> 01:46:46,019
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, maybe that's what's needed.

1389
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:47,280
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say so.

1390
01:46:47,380 --> 01:46:53,926
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if it seems like... Do we need Sally Field to jump up on a table with her sign about starting a union?

1391
01:46:54,867 --> 01:46:55,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I...

1392
01:46:58,408 --> 01:47:06,711
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that if anyone is working in that kind of condition, it doesn't matter how exhausted they are.

1393
01:47:07,551 --> 01:47:19,516
[SPEAKER_09]: If someone does not think enough of themselves, their family, and doing work that they enjoy to try to make their workplace a better place to be, then they don't need to be there.

1394
01:47:20,579 --> 01:47:27,471
[SPEAKER_04]: One of our listeners in chat, I'll withhold their name here because they are saying something somewhat negative, says, it's hard to say no, DarkSakura.

1395
01:47:27,691 --> 01:47:31,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Once it's okay, twice you don't get a raise and all the industry is connected.

1396
01:47:34,593 --> 01:47:36,014
[SPEAKER_04]: He's speaking to that same fear.

1397
01:47:36,194 --> 01:47:38,336
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I get what you're saying, but I get what he's saying.

1398
01:47:38,656 --> 01:47:41,158
[SPEAKER_04]: There's got something has to give.

1399
01:47:41,218 --> 01:47:41,678
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

1400
01:47:41,738 --> 01:47:43,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that goes back to the same thing.

1401
01:47:43,239 --> 01:47:45,781
[SPEAKER_09]: If you are unhappy with the environment, you change it.

1402
01:47:46,702 --> 01:47:58,631
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, one person may be one person, but for every one person that has a particular distaste for something, there are going to be at least eight other people around them, very close to them that have that same feeling.

1403
01:47:59,986 --> 01:48:15,363
[SPEAKER_04]: and sometimes all it takes is for one person to say something before everybody else decides hey yeah we agree well this issue is long from over I'm sure about that maybe it's going to end up being the wives that take this on I don't know it's going to be very interesting to see what develops but for now we should probably move on to another email

1404
01:48:18,780 --> 01:48:20,420
[SPEAKER_09]: One comes from Lucky Nuts.

1405
01:48:21,761 --> 01:48:23,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Jamie keeps talking about her vault.

1406
01:48:23,461 --> 01:48:32,124
[SPEAKER_09]: I, too, have a vault that I've kept for the last 20 years or so, and I'm considering spending the next few months clearing it out on eBay to buy more grown-up things, like a new sailboat.

1407
01:48:32,885 --> 01:48:35,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you ever thought about clearing out your collection, and if so, did you later regret it?

1408
01:48:36,626 --> 01:48:38,627
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, grown-up is a concept.

1409
01:48:40,247 --> 01:48:44,709
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you're getting rid of one thing for recreation to get another thing for recreation.

1410
01:48:46,298 --> 01:48:48,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Grown up is bullshit.

1411
01:48:49,041 --> 01:48:51,122
[SPEAKER_09]: So drop that little attitude right there.

1412
01:48:51,303 --> 01:48:52,584
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate that attitude so much.

1413
01:48:53,565 --> 01:48:55,767
[SPEAKER_09]: And no, I'm not getting rid of the collection ever.

1414
01:48:56,807 --> 01:48:57,628
[SPEAKER_09]: I love our collection.

1415
01:48:57,668 --> 01:48:58,649
[SPEAKER_09]: I go back and use all the stuff.

1416
01:48:58,729 --> 01:49:00,491
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm happy just looking at it.

1417
01:49:01,716 --> 01:49:04,837
[SPEAKER_09]: I like going in the vault and just looking around and going, damn, we got some cool shit.

1418
01:49:04,857 --> 01:49:05,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at all this shit.

1419
01:49:06,117 --> 01:49:06,517
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1420
01:49:06,597 --> 01:49:08,018
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how I feel.

1421
01:49:08,058 --> 01:49:09,398
[SPEAKER_09]: And then she'll invite other people over.

1422
01:49:09,618 --> 01:49:11,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, Rob, come over and look at all my shit.

1423
01:49:12,979 --> 01:49:14,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Come over here and help me play with this.

1424
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:22,561
[SPEAKER_09]: And by the way, if you go to our YouTube channel, you can actually see some video taken in the vault if you want to see what I have.

1425
01:49:23,161 --> 01:49:25,142
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you are going to sell some of your stuff, though, talk to me.

1426
01:49:27,330 --> 01:49:27,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

1427
01:49:27,811 --> 01:49:28,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I'll have something I want.

1428
01:49:28,731 --> 01:49:29,132
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1429
01:49:30,233 --> 01:49:34,417
[SPEAKER_04]: I just would say from a non-collector perspective, I've sold some of my stuff.

1430
01:49:34,817 --> 01:49:40,123
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never really regretted it though because I try to really think about it and not sell anything that I think I might remotely play again.

1431
01:49:40,443 --> 01:49:42,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I think I sold my copy of Dead or Alive 4.

1432
01:49:42,725 --> 01:49:44,186
[SPEAKER_04]: I just knew I wasn't going to play that again.

1433
01:49:44,707 --> 01:49:47,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Misty said she was happy looking at it while she was visiting.

1434
01:49:48,230 --> 01:49:48,631
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1435
01:49:50,891 --> 01:49:58,033
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I did get two emails from one other person, but I'm only going to read one of them because really the first one was all like, I like Silent Hill Shattered Memories.

1436
01:49:58,433 --> 01:50:05,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I say, though, real quick, though, if you did sell your collection and buy the sailboat, you know that you could say, I'm on a boat.

1437
01:50:07,655 --> 01:50:09,476
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that's one of my ringtones on my phone.

1438
01:50:09,576 --> 01:50:09,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it?

1439
01:50:10,076 --> 01:50:10,676
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not surprised.

1440
01:50:11,136 --> 01:50:12,876
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the one when work calls.

1441
01:50:12,896 --> 01:50:14,057
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you buy the sailboat.

1442
01:50:14,097 --> 01:50:15,097
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to say, I'm on a boat.

1443
01:50:15,977 --> 01:50:16,977
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to be on a boat.

1444
01:50:17,178 --> 01:50:18,078
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to play my games.

1445
01:50:19,722 --> 01:50:20,142
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1446
01:50:48,675 --> 01:50:50,296
[SPEAKER_09]: because then you don't have to do all the crap to it.

1447
01:50:51,976 --> 01:50:52,776
[SPEAKER_09]: God, I'm smart.

1448
01:50:52,916 --> 01:50:56,177
[SPEAKER_09]: I should just be a financial advisor even though I kind of suck at it.

1449
01:50:56,577 --> 01:50:58,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't buy a goddamn boat, idiot.

1450
01:50:59,218 --> 01:51:00,639
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't need a boat.

1451
01:51:00,839 --> 01:51:01,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck boats.

1452
01:51:02,339 --> 01:51:02,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Rent it.

1453
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:05,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Charter a boat.

1454
01:51:05,380 --> 01:51:07,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, you need a financial advice podcast.

1455
01:51:07,961 --> 01:51:08,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck no.

1456
01:51:09,261 --> 01:51:12,322
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be nothing but Dan yelling at me for spending too much money on comics.

1457
01:51:14,963 --> 01:51:15,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck rent.

1458
01:51:15,503 --> 01:51:16,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Buy comics.

1459
01:51:19,096 --> 01:51:26,022
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, my grammar has greatly improved, except you're not using any capital letters and you misspelled grammar.

1460
01:51:41,869 --> 01:51:45,732
[SPEAKER_09]: I was wondering if you guys have ever played the MMO Mabinogi.

1461
01:51:46,092 --> 01:51:50,155
[SPEAKER_09]: If so, why have you guys never mentioned it because we haven't?

1462
01:51:50,636 --> 01:51:51,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Never heard of it, ever.

1463
01:51:51,396 --> 01:51:52,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not try it?

1464
01:51:52,097 --> 01:51:58,101
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's a lot like World of Warcraft except for Mabinogi is PS3.

1465
01:51:59,142 --> 01:52:04,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Is the PS3 of the two you pay for nothing except pet and extra characters unless you are smart enough?

1466
01:52:07,268 --> 01:52:07,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

1467
01:52:07,648 --> 01:52:08,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this spam?

1468
01:52:08,649 --> 01:52:10,851
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's... Alright, just checking.

1469
01:52:12,331 --> 01:52:13,755
[SPEAKER_04]: I really can't read this.

1470
01:52:13,915 --> 01:52:16,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know how easy it would be to... Okay, I'll come stand behind you.

1471
01:52:18,710 --> 01:52:25,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Also on another note, the gift Rob got from Loki, where would I find when you can play an NES game on it?

1472
01:52:25,556 --> 01:52:26,918
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an FC Mobile, look it up online.

1473
01:52:28,419 --> 01:52:38,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I make AMVs from video games and I was wondering, can you guys have any ideas for an AMV?

1474
01:52:38,468 --> 01:52:42,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, there should be an AMV where the main character is learning proper spelling and grammar.

1475
01:52:43,152 --> 01:52:43,913
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be fascinating.

1476
01:52:44,233 --> 01:52:45,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, update the podcast more often.

1477
01:52:45,974 --> 01:52:46,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not.

1478
01:52:46,274 --> 01:52:46,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

1479
01:52:46,834 --> 01:52:47,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, dude, I'm sorry.

1480
01:52:48,936 --> 01:52:52,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, spammers need to be raped with a flea warhead.

1481
01:52:52,477 --> 01:52:53,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that I can get behind.

1482
01:52:55,339 --> 01:52:55,999
[SPEAKER_04]: No pun intended.

1483
01:52:56,159 --> 01:52:56,740
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1484
01:52:56,880 --> 01:53:00,942
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't read your email because it doesn't make sense in my brain.

1485
01:53:02,423 --> 01:53:02,963
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1486
01:53:03,083 --> 01:53:07,325
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll look at your YouTube videos, but your email hurts my head.

1487
01:53:08,786 --> 01:53:09,106
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1488
01:53:09,406 --> 01:53:09,927
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1489
01:53:10,687 --> 01:53:11,247
[SPEAKER_09]: I tried.

1490
01:53:11,467 --> 01:53:12,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any other emails?

1491
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:13,541
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1492
01:53:13,701 --> 01:53:16,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there was another one written by the same person, but again... Yes, read it.

1493
01:53:16,208 --> 01:53:16,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Please, please, please.

1494
01:53:17,111 --> 01:53:18,033
[SPEAKER_09]: I love Silent Hill.

1495
01:53:19,216 --> 01:53:20,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, fine.

1496
01:53:20,099 --> 01:53:20,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Shit.

1497
01:53:22,256 --> 01:53:25,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, first off, this was the first Silent Hill game I've played, so be nice, DarkSakura.

1498
01:53:26,118 --> 01:53:26,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Do I have to?

1499
01:53:28,039 --> 01:53:29,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Too late.

1500
01:53:29,679 --> 01:53:32,060
[SPEAKER_09]: You play as Harry Masons, whose daughter is missing, blah blah blah.

1501
01:53:32,420 --> 01:53:32,921
[SPEAKER_09]: We know all that.

1502
01:53:34,721 --> 01:53:35,722
[SPEAKER_09]: The gameplay is seamless.

1503
01:53:36,422 --> 01:53:41,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Of the PSP, your trusty flashlight adds an extra compen...

1504
01:53:45,166 --> 01:53:47,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Commentary pending what you're looking at?

1505
01:53:47,870 --> 01:53:49,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1506
01:53:49,873 --> 01:53:50,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I can't.

1507
01:53:51,375 --> 01:53:52,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, though, but I do like this.

1508
01:53:52,737 --> 01:53:54,760
[SPEAKER_09]: The Nightmare Sequences are a pain in the ass without weapons.

1509
01:53:56,782 --> 01:53:57,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Go back and play the first Silent Hill.

1510
01:53:58,750 --> 01:53:59,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I try?

1511
01:53:59,611 --> 01:54:00,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I try reading the review?

1512
01:54:00,752 --> 01:54:02,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you mind if I give it a shot?

1513
01:54:02,334 --> 01:54:03,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Give it a try, Rob.

1514
01:54:03,035 --> 01:54:03,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on one minute.

1515
01:54:04,216 --> 01:54:07,179
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta bring it up here in studio here, and I will read the review for you guys.

1516
01:54:07,460 --> 01:54:08,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, because it's really bad.

1517
01:54:09,262 --> 01:54:09,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, hold on.

1518
01:54:09,742 --> 01:54:10,363
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting in there.

1519
01:54:10,723 --> 01:54:10,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1520
01:54:11,104 --> 01:54:12,465
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Silent Hill Shattered Memories?

1521
01:54:13,006 --> 01:54:13,726
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be the one.

1522
01:54:14,027 --> 01:54:15,168
[SPEAKER_11]: Will this review involve...

1523
01:54:18,487 --> 01:54:22,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, first off, this is the first Silent Hill game I've played, so be nice, DarkSakura.

1524
01:54:23,273 --> 01:54:25,496
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, this is a remake of the original.

1525
01:54:25,576 --> 01:54:31,143
[SPEAKER_04]: You play as Harry Mason, whose daughter is missing, and you travel through the mysterious small town of Silent while searching for her.

1526
01:54:31,721 --> 01:54:33,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Gameplay is seamless of the PSP.

1527
01:54:33,862 --> 01:54:37,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Your trusty flashlight adds an extra commentary pending what you are looking at.

1528
01:54:37,743 --> 01:54:41,704
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a cell phone to take pictures of static memoirs and whatnot.

1529
01:54:42,124 --> 01:54:50,326
[SPEAKER_04]: The most annoying part of the game is the physiest Trist who pops up and pisses you off and the nightmare sequences are a pain in the ass without weapons.

1530
01:54:50,927 --> 01:54:59,089
[SPEAKER_04]: The story changes depending on how you talk with the physierest you could get ending where she's not found or one where blah blah blah spoilers.

1531
01:54:59,489 --> 01:55:02,030
[SPEAKER_04]: The game is more fuck with your head than super scary.

1532
01:55:02,331 --> 01:55:04,452
[SPEAKER_04]: I give it a 4.5 out of 5.

1533
01:55:06,272 --> 01:55:09,994
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought for sure you were going to use one of the audio effects on our new mixing board.

1534
01:55:11,055 --> 01:55:12,235
[SPEAKER_11]: But I was wrong.

1535
01:55:12,275 --> 01:55:12,836
[SPEAKER_11]: You went back.

1536
01:55:13,136 --> 01:55:13,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Echo voice, Rob.

1537
01:55:13,816 --> 01:55:14,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Echo voice.

1538
01:55:14,396 --> 01:55:15,237
[SPEAKER_04]: You want echo voice?

1539
01:55:15,357 --> 01:55:15,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Echo voice.

1540
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:23,701
[SPEAKER_04]: I own your soul.

1541
01:55:24,642 --> 01:55:25,582
[SPEAKER_04]: I give it a 4.5 out of 5.

1542
01:55:29,178 --> 01:55:30,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's enough of that, for real.

1543
01:55:30,238 --> 01:55:32,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds like you're at the back end of a tunnel, Rob.

1544
01:55:32,699 --> 01:55:32,919
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1545
01:55:33,820 --> 01:55:34,800
[SPEAKER_04]: New mixing boards are fun.

1546
01:55:35,801 --> 01:55:36,541
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it for the mailbag?

1547
01:55:37,521 --> 01:55:37,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

1548
01:55:38,282 --> 01:55:38,522
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1549
01:55:39,782 --> 01:55:44,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on then to the FUs of the week because sometimes we get angsty here on this show.

1550
01:55:44,584 --> 01:55:46,385
[SPEAKER_04]: That poor guy is never going to email us again.

1551
01:55:46,425 --> 01:55:50,306
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you want to have your emails ready to kill, please send them to mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

1552
01:55:50,566 --> 01:55:54,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Just remember, we have Yakety Sax ready to go whenever we need it.

1553
01:55:54,888 --> 01:55:57,169
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have the angst music ready to go for the FUs of the week.

1554
01:56:13,499 --> 01:56:14,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck you, Cryptic.

1555
01:56:15,201 --> 01:56:16,262
[SPEAKER_09]: For your damn servers.

1556
01:56:17,604 --> 01:56:21,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Make your servers hold more people so that I don't have to play a laggy STO.

1557
01:56:21,588 --> 01:56:21,888
[SPEAKER_09]: The end.

1558
01:56:23,923 --> 01:56:26,224
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to people that break into my car.

1559
01:56:26,624 --> 01:56:39,048
[SPEAKER_11]: And apparently there is a dude, or somebody, I'm assuming it's a dude, that broke into my car last night because I had boxes in the back of my car to give to my co-worker who's moving.

1560
01:56:39,728 --> 01:56:43,049
[SPEAKER_11]: And those boxes were of a microwave and computers and whatnot.

1561
01:56:43,529 --> 01:56:46,170
[SPEAKER_11]: And so they thought, hey, look, microwave and computers.

1562
01:56:46,670 --> 01:56:50,151
[SPEAKER_11]: So they broke the back window, pulled the box out, and go, hey, this is a box.

1563
01:56:50,731 --> 01:56:51,572
[SPEAKER_11]: What the hell is this?

1564
01:56:52,272 --> 01:56:58,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, under those boxes was my rifle bag with all my airsoft guns, and they decided to take that in protest.

1565
01:56:59,477 --> 01:57:01,398
[SPEAKER_11]: So I am without airsoft guns.

1566
01:57:01,458 --> 01:57:03,019
[SPEAKER_11]: So you gave a thief guns.

1567
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:04,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Good move, Loki.

1568
01:57:04,020 --> 01:57:05,081
[SPEAKER_11]: I gave a thief fake guns.

1569
01:57:05,341 --> 01:57:10,384
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I gave him guns without batteries or any of the ammo, because he didn't take any of the ammo.

1570
01:57:10,584 --> 01:57:11,645
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just sitting right there.

1571
01:57:12,225 --> 01:57:20,271
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever, you know, I don't care because I haven't played airsoft in over a year, so... Yeah, it's so sad, but... If I want more airsoft guns, I'll just buy more.

1572
01:57:22,312 --> 01:57:23,352
[SPEAKER_11]: I have arcade stuff to play.

1573
01:57:23,392 --> 01:57:25,093
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have players often.

1574
01:57:25,113 --> 01:57:34,999
[SPEAKER_11]: The weather's been crappy, so... It's unfortunate, but it's not like... I'm not sad by it at all.

1575
01:57:37,237 --> 01:57:52,894
[SPEAKER_04]: um well if that's it for your FU of the week mine would be just more moving angst and cleaning and putting things in boxes and moving it and yeah it's everything that comes with moving but I'll be over it in a couple weeks when it's over I'm sure

1576
01:57:54,184 --> 01:57:55,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, things are good.

1577
01:57:55,105 --> 01:57:56,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a lot to complain about.

1578
01:57:56,407 --> 01:57:57,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Life is happy.

1579
01:57:57,448 --> 01:57:57,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

1580
01:57:57,568 --> 01:57:58,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Butterflies and sparkles.

1581
01:57:59,451 --> 01:58:06,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, a couple more news stories for you guys and then your chance to interact with us live on the phone on our Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio or 1-877-GAME-OLR

1582
01:58:10,175 --> 01:58:17,542
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Dante's Inferno is getting some download content, which I think is bundled actually with the PlayStation 3 version.

1583
01:58:18,463 --> 01:58:23,528
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently someone got the game early, or downloaded the game early, and...

1584
01:58:25,129 --> 01:58:26,030
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

1585
01:58:42,361 --> 01:59:10,648
[SPEAKER_11]: so that's kind of neat but apparently if it's not in the PS3 version I know it's definitely not in the 360 version so if you do have the 360 you'll have to get it in April hopefully it is included in the PS3 version in which case you'll get it immediately but that's neat and I don't know if it's going to be free later on but it's apparently a trailer that's on the disc so

1586
01:59:12,003 --> 01:59:12,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty.

1587
01:59:13,569 --> 01:59:14,773
[SPEAKER_04]: I got one more story for you guys.

1588
01:59:14,793 --> 01:59:17,704
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you going to pick up Dante's Inferno, by the way, just before I get to my thing?

1589
01:59:18,439 --> 01:59:27,123
[SPEAKER_11]: No, because I have Borderlands, and I now have Bioshock 2 to play, and really I'll just pick up God of War 3.

1590
01:59:27,743 --> 01:59:36,927
[SPEAKER_11]: Although Dante's Inferno looked kind of cool, and I'm interested just to kind of play through it mindlessly, but not right away.

1591
01:59:37,127 --> 01:59:38,888
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll wait for the maybe drop in price.

1592
01:59:39,328 --> 01:59:44,250
[SPEAKER_11]: And Final Fantasy XIII is right around the corner, so I really don't have time to play all these games.

1593
01:59:44,310 --> 01:59:44,691
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just...

1594
01:59:46,451 --> 02:00:02,677
[SPEAKER_04]: it's just too many games I'll probably put it in the queue of things to play like on my literal now that I use a rental game so I stop spending 60 bucks on games every week put it in my queue of things to play but you know one thing I'm learning you don't always get what's number one on your list right away it's not quite as effective as Netflix just so you know

1595
02:00:04,037 --> 02:00:25,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, one other story for you guys, and this does have to do with spending money Buying stuff on your computer using one of those digital distribution sites You know Steam, they are probably the kings of what's going on But there are some other websites that sell games too And one of them is GOG.com, GOG.com Or you might call them the good old games

1596
02:00:25,962 --> 02:00:26,323
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1597
02:00:44,625 --> 02:00:55,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, obviously some publishers are not having that, but GOG.com or Good Old Games tries to kind of legitimize that by selling DRM-free old games.

1598
02:00:55,916 --> 02:00:57,898
[SPEAKER_04]: And they got some big lands this week.

1599
02:00:58,318 --> 02:01:08,207
[SPEAKER_04]: They got a deal with Activision Publishing to get some Sierra classics, because Activision has access to those classics now, that you can't even find on Steam.

1600
02:01:09,028 --> 02:01:14,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of those games, by the way, that are out right now, the first two that were added, Arcanum of Steamworks and Magic Obscura.

1601
02:01:15,653 --> 02:01:18,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely an Obscura title because I haven't even heard of that one.

1602
02:01:18,235 --> 02:01:19,196
[SPEAKER_04]: But this one I definitely knew.

1603
02:01:19,736 --> 02:01:21,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Gabriel Knight, Sins of the Fathers.

1604
02:01:21,698 --> 02:01:23,519
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you ever heard of this game.

1605
02:01:23,639 --> 02:01:24,860
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard of the Gabriel Knight games.

1606
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:28,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's pretty cool because Tim Curry does a voice in the game.

1607
02:01:28,263 --> 02:01:29,624
[SPEAKER_04]: It was one of his voice acting gigs.

1608
02:01:30,224 --> 02:01:55,150
[SPEAKER_04]: 6 bucks for each one of those titles they are supposed to be doing like several titles a week over the next few months so a lot of these old school classic games if you are curious and checking them out you can go to GOG.com granted it's not the same as when that LucasArts pack was available for what like 9 bucks or something some obscenely low price on Steam over the holidays but you know you can still find some good old classic games

1609
02:01:56,490 --> 02:02:11,762
[SPEAKER_11]: I have plenty of games to play and I'm just trying to get through I'm still trying to sort my MAME ROM collection to eliminate all the crap I'm not going to use

1610
02:02:13,277 --> 02:02:13,998
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of it.

1611
02:02:14,218 --> 02:02:16,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Several folks in chat chanting down with DRM.

1612
02:02:16,881 --> 02:02:21,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's one of their big things is that they don't charge or they don't have really DRM on the games.

1613
02:02:22,148 --> 02:02:24,831
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you can buy them and it's legitimate.

1614
02:02:24,871 --> 02:02:31,238
[SPEAKER_04]: You can feel good karma and all that stuff and not have to worry about the whole abandoned ware and possibly getting viruses and all that stuff.

1615
02:02:31,919 --> 02:02:32,380
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

1616
02:02:34,068 --> 02:02:38,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, that's going to do it for the news tonight, and that's where we're going to go to our Skype line.

1617
02:02:38,610 --> 02:02:44,032
[SPEAKER_04]: It is now open, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1618
02:02:44,212 --> 02:02:49,554
[SPEAKER_04]: We are taking your calls live on this Sunday evening, Super Bowl Sunday, February the 7th of 2010.

1619
02:02:50,154 --> 02:02:53,035
[SPEAKER_04]: While we wait for some calls to come in, Loki's got some last-minute stories for us.

1620
02:02:54,175 --> 02:02:55,996
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I do.

1621
02:02:57,213 --> 02:03:00,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, this is Spazinator Hi Spazinator, what's on your mind buddy?

1622
02:03:25,790 --> 02:03:27,211
[SPEAKER_01]: Two things.

1623
02:03:28,633 --> 02:03:36,139
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you guys saw my tweets earlier this week, but I thought it would be worth mentioning.

1624
02:03:36,559 --> 02:03:42,324
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an anime series that I think you guys may want to check out.

1625
02:03:42,644 --> 02:03:46,307
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as I know, DarkSakura is into anime as well.

1626
02:03:46,772 --> 02:03:48,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, hold that thought, hold that thought.

1627
02:03:48,093 --> 02:03:52,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Because speaking of anime series, I totally forgot to get into this at the top of the show, and I wanted to.

1628
02:03:52,956 --> 02:03:57,780
[SPEAKER_04]: This weekend, I went to Japantown in San Francisco, and I totally thought of Jamie.

1629
02:03:58,200 --> 02:04:04,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, well, A, I saw the taiyaki place that I know she really loves, and she likes to eat there, and it made me think of her.

1630
02:04:04,965 --> 02:04:07,507
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we went to Japan Video and some of those places, and we were looking at...

1631
02:04:08,487 --> 02:04:12,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Anime, and I saw the Ragnarok anime on DVD.

1632
02:04:12,188 --> 02:04:14,549
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess they made like 25 episodes of a Ragnarok anime.

1633
02:04:14,569 --> 02:04:15,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they have a whole season.

1634
02:04:15,489 --> 02:04:16,689
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually pretty good.

1635
02:04:16,789 --> 02:04:17,530
[SPEAKER_08]: I've watched most of it.

1636
02:04:17,610 --> 02:04:17,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you?

1637
02:04:17,850 --> 02:04:18,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it made me think of you.

1638
02:04:18,810 --> 02:04:21,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, I should get this for Jamie, and then I'm thinking, no, she probably already has it.

1639
02:04:21,811 --> 02:04:26,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, no, actually, I downloaded it when it first started coming out on TV, and I never finished it.

1640
02:04:27,132 --> 02:04:27,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

1641
02:04:27,652 --> 02:04:29,093
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it actually won.

1642
02:04:29,213 --> 02:04:31,393
[SPEAKER_09]: It was pretty cute, pretty close to the game.

1643
02:04:31,573 --> 02:04:36,395
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm already getting the new DS one, the US one, because I tried playing it in Japanese.

1644
02:04:36,635 --> 02:04:36,995
[SPEAKER_09]: I tried.

1645
02:04:37,595 --> 02:04:45,339
[SPEAKER_04]: But a completely random tangent right next to all that stuff is a little store called Pika Pika, which is a picture booth store.

1646
02:04:45,399 --> 02:04:47,400
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the stores that's nothing but picture booths.

1647
02:04:47,860 --> 02:04:53,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I met up in Japantown with a bunch of people that I play World of Warcraft with, so it's like we had an IRL raid.

1648
02:04:53,603 --> 02:04:58,305
[SPEAKER_04]: So we raided Pika Pika, and one of the photo booths there, and there was like six of us in the photo booths.

1649
02:04:58,465 --> 02:05:03,688
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes like $9 to take a picture, but it's all like green platforms you stand on, and it puts in backgrounds.

1650
02:05:04,108 --> 02:05:05,709
[SPEAKER_04]: We had so much fun.

1651
02:05:05,729 --> 02:05:06,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Picture Club.

1652
02:05:06,589 --> 02:05:08,010
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so much fun.

1653
02:05:08,130 --> 02:05:11,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, seriously, I think these only exist in big cities.

1654
02:05:11,511 --> 02:05:13,252
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen one by Arcade Infinity, too.

1655
02:05:13,332 --> 02:05:14,492
[SPEAKER_04]: There used to be one right next door there.

1656
02:05:15,052 --> 02:05:17,273
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you have one of these in your town, it's a lot of fun.

1657
02:05:17,553 --> 02:05:18,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, totally.

1658
02:05:18,234 --> 02:05:19,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, sorry, Spazinator.

1659
02:05:19,174 --> 02:05:19,854
[SPEAKER_04]: I got off topic.

1660
02:05:19,874 --> 02:05:21,355
[SPEAKER_04]: But what was the anime you wanted to talk about?

1661
02:05:22,895 --> 02:05:24,756
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Dubslinger Girl.

1662
02:05:25,636 --> 02:05:28,417
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if either one of you have heard of it, but it's...

1663
02:05:30,370 --> 02:05:33,212
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two seasons of it.

1664
02:05:33,372 --> 02:05:35,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Both are like 13 episodes long.

1665
02:05:36,875 --> 02:05:56,771
[SPEAKER_01]: And the trick synopsis of it is this government agency over in Italy basically takes in kids that are basically dying and turns them into $6 million woman-type cyborgs and has them...

1666
02:05:58,086 --> 02:06:03,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Do assassinations for like assassinate terrorists and stuff like that.

1667
02:06:04,090 --> 02:06:07,532
[SPEAKER_04]: So wait, Gunslinger... Hold on, Gunslinger Girl was the name of the anime?

1668
02:06:08,912 --> 02:06:09,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1669
02:06:09,653 --> 02:06:10,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever heard of this, DarkSakura?

1670
02:06:10,973 --> 02:06:11,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I have.

1671
02:06:11,454 --> 02:06:12,995
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to try it out.

1672
02:06:13,015 --> 02:06:14,656
[SPEAKER_09]: I just haven't had a lot of time.

1673
02:06:14,756 --> 02:06:16,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this something available on the PlayStation 3 marketplace?

1674
02:06:17,017 --> 02:06:19,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know anime is like a big niche that they have on there.

1675
02:06:21,119 --> 02:06:21,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is.

1676
02:06:22,160 --> 02:06:24,001
[SPEAKER_01]: There's season one and season two.

1677
02:06:24,161 --> 02:06:24,922
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's...

1678
02:06:27,962 --> 02:06:32,306
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like a lot of Season 3, but there is another season there.

1679
02:06:32,366 --> 02:06:36,529
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's like a reimagining of the entire series.

1680
02:06:37,390 --> 02:06:41,553
[SPEAKER_01]: You may want to call it Season 2.5 if you want to call it that.

1681
02:06:41,873 --> 02:06:43,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, like a special, sure.

1682
02:06:44,655 --> 02:06:55,804
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I have the entire Season 1 and Season 2, and I just finished up Season 2 the other day, and oh my God, it's epic.

1683
02:06:56,724 --> 02:07:02,730
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to recommend that to the listeners and to the anime fans here in the studio as well.

1684
02:07:03,610 --> 02:07:06,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Gunslinger Girl, okay, so I'm really excited about that.

1685
02:07:06,773 --> 02:07:12,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else on the PlayStation Network we should be checking out right now?

1686
02:07:23,690 --> 02:07:27,954
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's something you kind of sort of touched on on your last show.

1687
02:07:28,894 --> 02:07:35,299
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the new Music Guidance Sigma 2 table for Zen Pinball.

1688
02:07:36,720 --> 02:07:41,404
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got that today and it's pretty good.

1689
02:07:43,025 --> 02:07:48,510
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, personally, I think it's a little bit better than some of the other tables that are currently available for the game.

1690
02:07:48,730 --> 02:07:50,111
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Zen Pinball.

1691
02:07:50,131 --> 02:07:51,032
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to check that out.

1692
02:07:51,052 --> 02:07:52,713
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1693
02:07:53,365 --> 02:07:56,009
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd definitely give it a thumbs up on that.

1694
02:07:56,189 --> 02:07:57,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

1695
02:07:57,531 --> 02:08:01,618
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's get going so you can take more calls.

1696
02:08:01,798 --> 02:08:02,439
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

1697
02:08:03,160 --> 02:08:04,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you have a good week, Spazinator.

1698
02:08:04,422 --> 02:08:07,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for the phone call and we'll forgive you for the bad joke on Twitter earlier, okay?

1699
02:08:10,678 --> 02:08:13,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, you too buddy, bye

1700
02:08:28,475 --> 02:08:30,056
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess maybe you can still get a one-day ticket.

1701
02:08:30,737 --> 02:08:31,437
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going.

1702
02:08:31,798 --> 02:08:33,038
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to PAX East.

1703
02:08:33,619 --> 02:08:34,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, really, I have tickets.

1704
02:08:35,320 --> 02:08:37,641
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually just bought a regular ticket.

1705
02:08:38,022 --> 02:08:43,545
[SPEAKER_04]: I decided I didn't want to do the media thing because, A, PAX doesn't really do much for media, and that's fine.

1706
02:08:43,685 --> 02:08:47,248
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally am cool with that, and I think that's actually the way I wish E3 was that way.

1707
02:08:48,469 --> 02:08:56,134
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, I'm going as a gamer, as a fan, just like the rest of you, and don't really want to have to work through all of PAX.

1708
02:08:56,274 --> 02:08:57,815
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just going to have fun.

1709
02:08:58,235 --> 02:08:59,356
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll be around at the show.

1710
02:08:59,456 --> 02:09:07,819
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try, when the schedule comes out, I will try to find like a gaming lounge time, maybe with the DS game I enjoy, that I'll go be at.

1711
02:09:08,019 --> 02:09:11,540
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll let you guys know more about that when it gets a little closer to the show.

1712
02:09:11,960 --> 02:09:12,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1713
02:09:12,941 --> 02:09:13,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1714
02:09:14,081 --> 02:09:14,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Good day, sir.

1715
02:09:14,641 --> 02:09:18,663
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Lieutenant Sal Tome of USS Takahashi, requesting permission to come aboard.

1716
02:09:19,843 --> 02:09:21,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you a Star Trek Online addict as well?

1717
02:09:22,604 --> 02:09:24,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I just picked it up last night.

1718
02:09:24,165 --> 02:09:24,945
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Ranma, everyone.

1719
02:09:25,105 --> 02:09:25,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, hi, how you doing?

1720
02:09:26,186 --> 02:09:27,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Sir, you getting the lag too?

1721
02:09:29,005 --> 02:09:29,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really.

1722
02:09:29,985 --> 02:09:30,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

1723
02:09:31,345 --> 02:09:41,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, I mean, I don't think it's my graphics card, I think it's their servers, but I had to wait in the queue of 118, and it takes like five whole seconds to move in any direction.

1724
02:09:42,067 --> 02:09:47,348
[SPEAKER_06]: I have not had that problem at all, and mind you, my video card is like almost three years old.

1725
02:09:48,288 --> 02:09:52,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, mine's actually just under what the correct one is supposed to be.

1726
02:09:52,709 --> 02:09:57,210
[SPEAKER_09]: But seriously, they say there's supposed to be increasing server capacity, but they haven't yet.

1727
02:09:58,524 --> 02:10:01,166
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, I just haven't had that problem at all.

1728
02:10:02,386 --> 02:10:11,592
[SPEAKER_09]: It may also be the difference in locations that we're at too, because right now I just hit memory alpha and my character's all like running all over the place and there's a ton of people there.

1729
02:10:12,712 --> 02:10:14,173
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe it has to do with location too.

1730
02:10:14,593 --> 02:10:15,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably so.

1731
02:10:16,214 --> 02:10:18,696
[SPEAKER_04]: So is this what you called in to talk about tonight, Star Trek Online?

1732
02:10:19,396 --> 02:10:20,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that too, that too.

1733
02:10:22,613 --> 02:10:26,756
[SPEAKER_06]: First thing I want to talk about is something from a couple of podcasts before.

1734
02:10:26,816 --> 02:10:32,259
[SPEAKER_06]: You mentioned about how it's possible for Steam to sell so many games at dirt cheap prices.

1735
02:10:32,539 --> 02:10:32,819
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1736
02:10:33,679 --> 02:10:35,360
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe I have the answer for that.

1737
02:10:35,540 --> 02:10:35,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Please.

1738
02:10:36,521 --> 02:10:40,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I used to work in a video store and we would rent games, so on and so forth.

1739
02:10:41,303 --> 02:10:47,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Once the rental of the game got to a certain point, we could sell it at a price because all the rentals...

1740
02:10:47,907 --> 02:10:49,648
[SPEAKER_06]: made the money back on the purchase of the game.

1741
02:10:50,228 --> 02:10:54,230
[SPEAKER_06]: My thing is, with Steam, once they have this game, they sell it at that price.

1742
02:10:54,610 --> 02:11:01,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Once they've made the money back on selling the game, they can just cut the price to as cheap as they want and that's just extra cash for them.

1743
02:11:03,362 --> 02:11:07,206
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would still think that the deals are based on percentages of sales.

1744
02:11:07,246 --> 02:11:12,211
[SPEAKER_04]: That seems kind of odd that it would work based on how much of it sells, I guess.

1745
02:11:13,633 --> 02:11:14,373
[SPEAKER_04]: I get what you're saying.

1746
02:11:14,413 --> 02:11:15,034
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes sense.

1747
02:11:15,114 --> 02:11:15,535
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know.

1748
02:11:15,575 --> 02:11:21,561
[SPEAKER_04]: I think maybe the whole retail strategy to digital distribution seems a little apples to oranges.

1749
02:11:21,621 --> 02:11:22,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you could be right, though.

1750
02:11:23,062 --> 02:11:23,523
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't.

1751
02:11:24,668 --> 02:11:31,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, because when we rent these games, like there was one game, you know, we have like five copies of Mortal Kombat.

1752
02:11:31,550 --> 02:11:40,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Three of them will be selling for like $30 and two will be selling for, I'd say, $40 because of the rental turnaround rate on those games.

1753
02:11:41,112 --> 02:11:52,595
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if they get a game, they sell it at this price, they make the money back off of, you know, the licensing, the rights, the time it costs that they invested into it, then there you go.

1754
02:11:53,581 --> 02:12:21,001
[SPEAKER_04]: well I was also just the mindset I mean honestly I always and still kind of think the reason for the sale is that you know assuming it is based off percentages those companies are still making five dollars off a game they would have made no dollars off of had it not been on Steam on a huge ass sale you know some money's better than no money a long forgotten game that got booted off of shelves years ago so I don't know good thought though I mean anything is possible and unfortunately until we know somebody on the inside at Steam that knows the agreements of the arrangements we just won't know

1755
02:12:21,673 --> 02:12:23,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but we can go off of that for the time being.

1756
02:12:24,616 --> 02:12:24,996
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1757
02:12:25,376 --> 02:12:25,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine.

1758
02:12:26,637 --> 02:12:28,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you want to mention?

1759
02:12:28,359 --> 02:12:32,122
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to say thanks for taking a chance to listen to my podcast over the weekend.

1760
02:12:32,523 --> 02:12:35,105
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to admit I downloaded it, but I didn't listen to it yet, but I will.

1761
02:12:35,866 --> 02:12:36,546
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.

1762
02:12:36,586 --> 02:12:37,127
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.

1763
02:12:37,427 --> 02:12:43,052
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're looking for good titles, I recommend Kido Tenshi Angelic Lair.

1764
02:12:43,492 --> 02:12:44,954
[SPEAKER_06]: It's free on Netflix right now.

1765
02:12:45,895 --> 02:12:48,096
[SPEAKER_04]: What are some good animes based off of video games?

1766
02:12:50,469 --> 02:12:52,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember Tower of Druaga, that old video game?

1767
02:12:52,781 --> 02:12:53,042
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.

1768
02:12:53,752 --> 02:12:54,772
[SPEAKER_04]: That's become an anime.

1769
02:12:54,792 --> 02:12:55,993
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it's been licensed.

1770
02:12:56,313 --> 02:12:56,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1771
02:12:56,673 --> 02:12:59,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they had kind of a renaissance of that game a while ago, too.

1772
02:12:59,535 --> 02:13:01,375
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a new Duraga game, I think, on PS2.

1773
02:13:01,415 --> 02:13:02,416
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes sense.

1774
02:13:02,936 --> 02:13:03,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting.

1775
02:13:04,277 --> 02:13:05,457
[SPEAKER_04]: One other quick question I have for you.

1776
02:13:06,058 --> 02:13:11,160
[SPEAKER_04]: A movie I saw at the video store that looked hilarious, and I don't know, maybe Jamie knows of this, too.

1777
02:13:11,580 --> 02:13:22,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently it was a Japanese movie directed by the same guy who did Ichi the Killer, and it was advertised as The Sound of Music meets Dawn of the Dead.

1778
02:13:23,593 --> 02:13:28,157
[SPEAKER_06]: That, I don't know, but I believe the director was Takahashi Mike, or Miike?

1779
02:13:28,357 --> 02:13:37,225
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked hilarious from the box art, and I was wondering before I go out and either spend money on that or obtain it through questionable means, if it was worth my time.

1780
02:13:38,726 --> 02:13:43,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything along those lines of Ichi Tequila, I keep hearing is well worth the purchase.

1781
02:13:47,025 --> 02:13:53,127
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm using a website I should have used a long time ago and looking up Ichi the Killer on... The Hills Are Alive with Sound?

1782
02:13:54,027 --> 02:13:55,507
[SPEAKER_04]: It has another name to it, though.

1783
02:13:56,027 --> 02:14:02,489
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like the little tagline, I think, to the... It's... The Family Something was the name of it.

1784
02:14:02,809 --> 02:14:05,449
[SPEAKER_11]: The Happiness of the Katakrys?

1785
02:14:05,670 --> 02:14:06,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's it.

1786
02:14:06,890 --> 02:14:07,590
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the name of it.

1787
02:14:09,985 --> 02:14:10,885
[SPEAKER_11]: I've not heard of.

1788
02:14:11,005 --> 02:14:12,907
[SPEAKER_11]: The hills are alive with the sound of screaming.

1789
02:14:13,587 --> 02:14:15,428
[SPEAKER_11]: The sound of music means still in the dead.

1790
02:14:15,809 --> 02:14:16,789
[SPEAKER_11]: That was it.

1791
02:14:16,870 --> 02:14:17,870
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the box I saw.

1792
02:14:17,930 --> 02:14:19,972
[SPEAKER_11]: It's awesome because it made me lol.

1793
02:14:20,132 --> 02:14:22,193
[SPEAKER_04]: It made me lol for real.

1794
02:14:24,475 --> 02:14:27,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well maybe somebody else will call him later and tell me about that.

1795
02:14:27,457 --> 02:14:30,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright Ranma, we're going to let you go so we can get more calls, but thank you as always.

1796
02:14:30,099 --> 02:14:31,340
[SPEAKER_04]: And hey, have fun on Star Trek, okay?

1797
02:14:31,640 --> 02:14:31,940
[SPEAKER_04]: I will.

1798
02:14:32,361 --> 02:14:32,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Calm out.

1799
02:14:36,817 --> 02:14:41,598
[SPEAKER_04]: 1877-GAME-OLR 1877-GAME-OLR 1877-GAME-OLR 1877-GAME-OLR 1877-GAME-OLR 1877-GAME-OLR 1877-GAME-OLR 1877-GAME-OLR 1877-GAME-OLR 1877-GAME-OLR 1877-GAME-OLR

1800
02:15:01,604 --> 02:15:03,146
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the one and only Legend of Zaku.

1801
02:15:03,266 --> 02:15:04,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, how are you doing, Legend of Zaku?

1802
02:15:05,468 --> 02:15:09,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Recovering from almost a hangover this morning.

1803
02:15:09,451 --> 02:15:10,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Were you drinking before noon?

1804
02:15:10,892 --> 02:15:11,513
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on?

1805
02:15:11,793 --> 02:15:14,135
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was basically last night's drinking.

1806
02:15:14,615 --> 02:15:15,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I see.

1807
02:15:15,656 --> 02:15:20,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just say that I drank to the point where I drank into places where...

1808
02:15:22,281 --> 02:15:25,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, okay, you've got to stop typing during the show.

1809
02:15:25,743 --> 02:15:27,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, you can't type right now.

1810
02:15:27,663 --> 02:15:28,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

1811
02:15:29,404 --> 02:15:35,126
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I just wanted to bring up that whole harmonic speculation about the licenses.

1812
02:15:35,586 --> 02:15:36,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yes, please.

1813
02:15:37,567 --> 02:15:42,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, the way I see it is that Konami, the only thing they have going for them right now

1814
02:15:42,978 --> 02:15:43,579
[SPEAKER_05]: is lawyers.

1815
02:15:44,320 --> 02:15:51,669
[SPEAKER_05]: In other words, they sued Rockstar over ITG and they managed to win that case single-handedly and got their franchise.

1816
02:15:51,789 --> 02:15:54,192
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it was a complete rip-off of DDR.

1817
02:15:54,772 --> 02:15:55,473
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate to say it.

1818
02:15:55,493 --> 02:15:59,819
[SPEAKER_05]: You could probably say the same thing for whatever Harmonix is doing with whatever they...

1819
02:16:00,279 --> 02:16:02,340
[SPEAKER_05]: We think they're doing with those licenses

1820
02:16:25,558 --> 02:16:27,119
[SPEAKER_05]: before the whole rock band thing.

1821
02:16:27,259 --> 02:16:36,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Harmonix was also not sued over Guitar Hero because the look and feel from Guitar Freaks was completely different, whereas with I in the Groove, the look and feel was the exact same as DDR.

1822
02:16:37,003 --> 02:16:41,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, right on down to the backgrounds and animations and pretty much the way the arrows looked.

1823
02:16:42,125 --> 02:16:43,005
[SPEAKER_04]: They added mines.

1824
02:16:43,745 --> 02:16:43,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo!

1825
02:16:45,446 --> 02:16:50,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we also have to keep in mind that, I mean, you could have said the same thing for Pump It Up.

1826
02:16:50,210 --> 02:16:53,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't that almost a ripoff of DDR with those arrows?

1827
02:16:53,612 --> 02:17:01,798
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, though, that went back, I want to say Konami and Namiro made an agreement many years ago because Pump It Up was actually first.

1828
02:17:03,278 --> 02:17:05,641
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyhow, I don't want to rehash that old news.

1829
02:17:05,941 --> 02:17:06,282
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.

1830
02:17:06,342 --> 02:17:10,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so the lawyers and litigation is how Konami keeps their franchises.

1831
02:17:10,266 --> 02:17:25,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that all depends on how Harmonix is actually going to approach this, whether or not they're actually going to reinvent the same four-panel dance paradigm that we've seen for more than a decade, or they're going to go into a new direction.

1832
02:17:26,312 --> 02:17:30,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Chances are, if I was a betting man, I would say the latter.

1833
02:17:30,860 --> 02:17:33,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because they're pretty good at innovating.

1834
02:17:34,175 --> 02:17:36,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty good at innovating within rhythm.

1835
02:17:38,676 --> 02:17:39,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing, though.

1836
02:17:39,476 --> 02:17:40,837
[SPEAKER_04]: All of this is speculation, though.

1837
02:17:41,037 --> 02:17:46,198
[SPEAKER_04]: They could be licensing these songs for Rock Band for some weird little pop expansion they're doing.

1838
02:17:46,238 --> 02:17:47,338
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know.

1839
02:17:48,439 --> 02:17:54,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see those songs in particular being something that would blend well with Rock Band completely.

1840
02:17:55,401 --> 02:18:00,502
[SPEAKER_05]: The way I see it is that they're doing something outside of Rock Band with that.

1841
02:18:01,451 --> 02:18:20,499
[SPEAKER_04]: or Rock Band 3 is something we haven't thought of yet Pax East is probably going to give us some clues because Harmonix is in Boston this is happening in their backyard so this is the perfect place for them to make an announcement I think Harmonix is the kind of company that will drop a bomb at Pax East

1842
02:18:20,879 --> 02:18:33,747
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I would love to go and see it for myself, but since I was unemployed up until last week, there was no way I would have gotten tickets well in advance.

1843
02:18:34,247 --> 02:18:36,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, congratulations on getting employment though.

1844
02:18:36,769 --> 02:18:38,570
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good news, all things considered.

1845
02:18:39,551 --> 02:18:43,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, but I guess time will tell.

1846
02:18:43,923 --> 02:18:47,905
[SPEAKER_05]: I will give it my critical eye with my music games background and I'll let y'all know.

1847
02:18:47,945 --> 02:18:52,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, of course, and you have to make sure you don't want to, don't give them the benefit of the doubt.

1848
02:18:52,466 --> 02:18:52,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Try to

1849
02:19:08,410 --> 02:19:25,289
[SPEAKER_05]: well try to like press them on some hard questions obviously not treading into NBA stuff but just try to challenge them that they're trying to sell you on something that you think is not going to be revolutionary I'll do my best

1850
02:19:25,922 --> 02:19:31,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Zaku, any other thoughts here before we let you go?

1851
02:19:31,244 --> 02:19:37,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't drink a 40 ounce of liquor because all that's going to do is purge your stomach.

1852
02:19:37,806 --> 02:19:38,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Happened to me last night.

1853
02:19:39,367 --> 02:19:40,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Some sage advice.

1854
02:19:40,367 --> 02:19:41,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one, Zaku.

1855
02:19:42,008 --> 02:19:42,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1856
02:19:42,588 --> 02:19:42,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

1857
02:19:43,928 --> 02:19:46,649
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go ahead and take one more call if someone wants to call in.

1858
02:19:46,669 --> 02:19:49,830
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1859
02:19:50,370 --> 02:19:51,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, anything to tide us over?

1860
02:19:52,871 --> 02:19:54,712
[SPEAKER_04]: 250GB hard drives coming out in Japan in March.

1861
02:19:56,246 --> 02:19:56,506
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay.

1862
02:19:57,567 --> 02:19:58,667
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably over here eventually.

1863
02:20:00,609 --> 02:20:01,109
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's a good one.

1864
02:20:01,769 --> 02:20:04,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Santa Hedgehog is rumored to be playable in Mario Galaxy 2.

1865
02:20:06,562 --> 02:20:07,003
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember.

1866
02:20:27,706 --> 02:20:28,827
[SPEAKER_04]: I do remember something about it.

1867
02:20:28,847 --> 02:20:32,128
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there was a new Tetris game in development, but it's not the Dish Network thing.

1868
02:20:32,168 --> 02:20:35,590
[SPEAKER_04]: It was something about somebody was making a new Tetris.

1869
02:20:35,850 --> 02:20:36,851
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if the two are related.

1870
02:20:37,771 --> 02:20:38,051
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1871
02:20:38,131 --> 02:20:38,472
[SPEAKER_11]: Possibly.

1872
02:20:38,652 --> 02:20:40,333
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to cost you $2.99 a month.

1873
02:20:40,773 --> 02:20:42,173
[SPEAKER_11]: Really, just play it free online.

1874
02:20:42,213 --> 02:20:43,474
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't need to play it on your TV.

1875
02:20:43,874 --> 02:20:45,175
[SPEAKER_11]: Tetranet for life.

1876
02:20:46,416 --> 02:20:46,996
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything else.

1877
02:20:49,031 --> 02:20:55,120
[SPEAKER_11]: According to Game Informer, LA Noire is no longer a PS3 exclusive.

1878
02:20:55,461 --> 02:20:58,245
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, it's hitting the Xbox 360 as well.

1879
02:21:00,308 --> 02:21:01,731
[SPEAKER_11]: Another one lost.

1880
02:21:03,294 --> 02:21:03,854
[SPEAKER_11]: That's too bad.

1881
02:21:04,995 --> 02:21:05,715
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be pretty cool.

1882
02:21:06,396 --> 02:21:07,336
[SPEAKER_11]: Whenever the hell it comes out.

1883
02:21:08,437 --> 02:21:08,997
[SPEAKER_11]: Long ways away.

1884
02:21:10,118 --> 02:21:17,361
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of something else that's not an exclusive anymore, High Voltage was bringing a brand new game, The Grinder, which is going to be a Supernatural first-person shooter game.

1885
02:21:17,761 --> 02:21:19,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Originally going to be a Wii exclusive.

1886
02:21:19,582 --> 02:21:23,204
[SPEAKER_11]: However, now it's coming to Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC as well.

1887
02:21:23,864 --> 02:21:26,306
[SPEAKER_11]: And will probably look way better than the Wii version anyways.

1888
02:21:27,046 --> 02:21:29,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Last call, by the way, for phone calls.

1889
02:21:29,307 --> 02:21:32,147
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1890
02:21:32,167 --> 02:21:34,508
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to call into the show, it's an empty line right now.

1891
02:21:34,568 --> 02:21:36,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Bowl Sunday is a good day when everybody's distracted.

1892
02:21:36,868 --> 02:21:42,490
[SPEAKER_11]: And cracked in a two-headed contest to have fans submit user-made graffiti.

1893
02:21:43,290 --> 02:21:52,332
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of the pictures that got, I guess, won was of these two male agents making out, which is pretty awesome.

1894
02:21:55,013 --> 02:21:55,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1895
02:21:57,352 --> 02:22:16,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh, I, okay, whatever, hey That's all I have, that's it Alright I doesn't, oh, we just in the nick of time got another call Let's take this and we'll wrap it all up Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?

[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, this is X-Link Hey, X-Link, what's on your mind, buddy?

1897
02:22:19,864 --> 02:22:26,710
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I'm glad to, I was reading Kotaku earlier on today and realized that they're coming out with a new version of Blaster Master come tomorrow.

1898
02:22:27,190 --> 02:22:27,430
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh-huh.

1899
02:22:27,951 --> 02:22:30,013
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, well, did you listen to Part A tonight?

1900
02:22:30,053 --> 02:22:34,436
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a joygasm over it in Part A. Oh, did you really?

1901
02:22:34,496 --> 02:22:35,017
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

1902
02:22:35,157 --> 02:22:37,399
[SPEAKER_00]: I was having, we were having some issues.

1903
02:22:37,419 --> 02:22:39,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we know, Super Bowl, blah, blah, blah.

1904
02:22:39,140 --> 02:22:41,522
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no, nothing with Super Bowl at all.

1905
02:22:41,562 --> 02:22:42,563
[SPEAKER_00]: It was with the Step Kids.

1906
02:22:42,703 --> 02:22:44,225
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, okay, fair enough.

1907
02:22:44,245 --> 02:22:46,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what is on your mind, though, at least about the Blaster Master game?

1908
02:22:46,867 --> 02:22:47,728
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your thoughts on it?

1909
02:22:49,030 --> 02:23:02,598
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked over the video they had out on YouTube and I gazzled myself pretty much because this was one of the first games I got back when I had my NES and I buy it with my own money and I absolutely loved it.

1910
02:23:02,718 --> 02:23:04,439
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I had the World of Power book.

1911
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:06,780
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so good.

1912
02:23:06,900 --> 02:23:09,742
[SPEAKER_04]: All those novels by FX9 and stuff?

1913
02:23:09,762 --> 02:23:10,702
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I have a bunch of them.

1914
02:23:10,722 --> 02:23:11,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I had that one too.

1915
02:23:11,963 --> 02:23:12,984
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Simon's Quest book.

1916
02:23:13,044 --> 02:23:13,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Both were epic.

1917
02:23:13,784 --> 02:23:14,805
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I had the Metal Gear one too.

1918
02:23:16,579 --> 02:23:19,041
[SPEAKER_00]: I was missing this too because a lot of my books were burnt down.

1919
02:23:19,061 --> 02:23:30,888
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my old school stuff that the games I had, my PS1 games, a lot of those, I had back in my mom's apartment when I was moving from going from Orlando, Florida to Melbourne, Florida.

1920
02:23:31,668 --> 02:23:33,049
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that stuff got burnt down.

1921
02:23:33,189 --> 02:23:36,151
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an arson in my mom's apartment and a lot of that stuff got burnt down.

1922
02:23:36,171 --> 02:23:39,593
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to go online and refine the books, which...

1923
02:23:40,812 --> 02:23:47,358
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of books I got, but the Simon Quest and the Metal Gear, if you have them in good condition, are really valuable and really hard to find.

1924
02:23:47,378 --> 02:23:50,000
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the text, though, at least, is available online.

1925
02:23:50,020 --> 02:23:51,821
[SPEAKER_04]: You can read a lot of those novels online.

1926
02:23:51,841 --> 02:23:54,764
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the same thing, you know, collectors and all that.

1927
02:23:55,124 --> 02:23:58,167
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do, just a complete random-ass fact about those books.

1928
02:23:58,187 --> 02:24:03,551
[SPEAKER_04]: And for those that don't know what we're talking about, the World of Power were these books that they wrote about old NES games.

1929
02:24:03,631 --> 02:24:07,795
[SPEAKER_04]: But since a lot of the 8-bit video games didn't really have stories that made for very good books...

1930
02:24:08,195 --> 02:24:11,238
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of times the authors would kind of add their own stuff to it.

1931
02:24:11,278 --> 02:24:17,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, for instance, I believe the plot about Castlevania II had to do with some kid, like, warping himself into that world.

1932
02:24:17,803 --> 02:24:21,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it wasn't even really about Simon Belmont, but somebody... To no end, the Game Master.

1933
02:24:21,606 --> 02:24:22,306
[SPEAKER_04]: His little sidekick.

1934
02:24:23,787 --> 02:24:44,128
[SPEAKER_04]: but there were some extra characters in Blaster Master to make that story work too and here's the interesting thing I believe one of the characters was Eve which was I think like the name of the car or something or like was one of the robot characters they actually the programmers of Blaster Master made Eve they wrote her into the official canon and she was in the Game Boy game

1935
02:24:45,336 --> 02:24:47,697
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also from Part 2 from what I understand.

1936
02:24:47,757 --> 02:24:53,238
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe there was an actual Part 2 for Blaster Master and they brought the actual plot line from the book into the game.

1937
02:24:53,498 --> 02:24:54,458
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was kind of neat.

1938
02:24:54,998 --> 02:24:57,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Blaster Master was one of the better books.

1939
02:24:57,619 --> 02:25:05,000
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the covers, a lot of times the covers were different from the actual game covers from the video game.

1940
02:25:05,120 --> 02:25:08,661
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, because they took out the gun from the Metal Gear cover.

1941
02:25:08,981 --> 02:25:10,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I remember that.

1942
02:25:10,282 --> 02:25:11,182
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't promote violence.

1943
02:25:13,862 --> 02:25:14,642
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a kid's book.

1944
02:25:14,723 --> 02:25:15,263
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, come on.

1945
02:25:15,523 --> 02:25:17,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times down memory lane.

1946
02:25:17,363 --> 02:25:17,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

1947
02:25:19,844 --> 02:25:21,084
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to bring back those books.

1948
02:25:21,124 --> 02:25:22,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I guess they do have them to some extent.

1949
02:25:23,144 --> 02:25:26,285
[SPEAKER_04]: There's books about Halo, tons of books about World of Warcraft.

1950
02:25:26,385 --> 02:25:28,365
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're always bringing back the Chujo Adventures.

1951
02:25:28,405 --> 02:25:29,966
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see why they can't do it.

1952
02:25:30,846 --> 02:25:33,306
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the permission from the people and redo it.

1953
02:25:33,526 --> 02:25:36,187
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

1954
02:25:37,717 --> 02:25:41,338
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, I was just mostly, I know you were looking for some calls, so I was called about that.

1955
02:25:41,358 --> 02:25:47,740
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a guy really giddy about that, because I had a lot of my old school games, like Blaster Master was one of the first ones.

1956
02:25:47,760 --> 02:25:49,500
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, Castlevania was another one, too.

1957
02:25:49,720 --> 02:25:51,761
[SPEAKER_00]: Castlevania 2, I remember spending hours on it.

1958
02:25:52,441 --> 02:25:53,161
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giddy, too.

1959
02:25:53,201 --> 02:25:54,142
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish it was on PS3.

1960
02:25:54,202 --> 02:26:01,984
[SPEAKER_00]: I was burning out my friend's Nintendo NES, because we had it on for 18 hours straight, because we didn't want to turn it off, and we wanted to go through and beat the game, so...

1961
02:26:03,914 --> 02:26:07,318
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited, but I'm trying very hard not to get too excited.

1962
02:26:07,658 --> 02:26:10,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to set the expectations too high for this game.

1963
02:26:11,121 --> 02:26:12,963
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to set the bar somewhere in the middle.

1964
02:26:13,884 --> 02:26:15,886
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to get too excited and then be disappointed.

1965
02:26:15,926 --> 02:26:16,347
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

1966
02:26:16,883 --> 02:26:17,864
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I hear you, I hear you.

1967
02:26:17,884 --> 02:26:22,846
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be one of those things, like, you get all gung-ho about, and it's like, man, when the heck did I do this in the first place?

1968
02:26:23,006 --> 02:26:23,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1969
02:26:24,047 --> 02:26:24,647
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, excellent.

1970
02:26:24,667 --> 02:26:27,909
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you so much for the call, and you know what?

1971
02:26:28,009 --> 02:26:32,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, when you called, like, about two other people called in at the same time, so you lucked out, so congrats.

1972
02:26:32,932 --> 02:26:33,392
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.

1973
02:26:33,472 --> 02:26:33,792
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, man.

1974
02:26:33,812 --> 02:26:34,172
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.

1975
02:26:35,693 --> 02:26:37,375
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that is going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

1976
02:26:37,395 --> 02:26:39,137
[SPEAKER_04]: And I apologize to those folks that didn't get through.

1977
02:26:39,977 --> 02:26:44,281
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you do want to still interact with the show, remember, we do take Twitter topics every week.

1978
02:26:44,642 --> 02:26:45,983
[SPEAKER_04]: We do take emails every week.

1979
02:26:46,804 --> 02:26:47,124
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1980
02:26:47,845 --> 02:26:56,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Any way you can figure out on the internet on all of our various websites to contact us, we will probably consider reading it on the show if you find us on one of those many, many websites.

1981
02:26:57,013 --> 02:27:01,257
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go ahead and let Loki finish up any last-minute stories he has while we go ahead and shut down the Skype line.

1982
02:27:01,479 --> 02:27:02,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Terror Drome, Fighting Game, Horror Movie Characters

1983
02:27:24,853 --> 02:27:25,954
[SPEAKER_11]: I've not heard of this either.

1984
02:27:26,114 --> 02:27:26,694
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

1985
02:27:26,794 --> 02:27:30,036
[SPEAKER_11]: So you've got, you know, Freddy.

1986
02:27:31,437 --> 02:27:36,200
[SPEAKER_11]: You've got Jason from the Friday the 13th movies.

1987
02:27:36,460 --> 02:27:38,221
[SPEAKER_11]: You actually have Ash in there as well.

1988
02:27:39,562 --> 02:27:40,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Chucky.

1989
02:27:41,163 --> 02:27:42,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of cool characters.

1990
02:27:42,484 --> 02:27:43,424
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, here's the full list.

1991
02:27:43,984 --> 02:27:44,985
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, it's under construction.

1992
02:27:45,025 --> 02:27:45,545
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1993
02:27:46,546 --> 02:27:51,329
[SPEAKER_11]: But they do have a demo available online, I guess, that you can download online.

1994
02:27:54,292 --> 02:27:54,893
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.

1995
02:27:55,394 --> 02:27:57,276
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'll have to check that out.

1996
02:27:57,737 --> 02:28:06,209
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you want to check it out, it's at Terrordrome-TheGame.com That's it.

1997
02:28:08,472 --> 02:28:08,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1998
02:28:09,673 --> 02:28:12,235
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to link something in the chat room that has nothing to do with video games.

1999
02:28:12,555 --> 02:28:13,656
[SPEAKER_04]: But you thought you'd link it anyway.

2000
02:28:13,876 --> 02:28:14,277
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all good.

2001
02:28:14,837 --> 02:28:15,158
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it?

2002
02:28:15,638 --> 02:28:16,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Come have a look.

2003
02:28:16,238 --> 02:28:17,099
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually this right here.

2004
02:28:18,680 --> 02:28:19,641
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a big type nerd.

2005
02:28:21,223 --> 02:28:29,790
[SPEAKER_09]: And I like that there's this garage where they actually managed to get it where if you're looking right from a certain angle, everything is perfectly aligned.

2006
02:28:30,590 --> 02:28:33,292
[SPEAKER_09]: But as you go through, you see they've actually painted it all the way across.

2007
02:28:33,853 --> 02:28:36,415
[SPEAKER_04]: That is pretty nerdy, I gotta say.

2008
02:28:37,016 --> 02:28:38,377
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of those optical illusions.

2009
02:28:38,908 --> 02:28:44,891
[SPEAKER_09]: But, well, I'm also, you know, when I look at games, I actually have been paying more attention now to how they're designed, you know?

2010
02:28:45,351 --> 02:28:48,293
[SPEAKER_09]: The look and feel of them, and I think that has a lot to do with that.

2011
02:28:48,493 --> 02:28:50,554
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you have to know your way around everything.

2012
02:28:50,574 --> 02:28:52,415
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2013
02:28:52,575 --> 02:28:54,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, I still see you playing on the YouTube there.

2014
02:28:54,436 --> 02:28:56,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you get your thing fixed, or what'd you do?

2015
02:28:56,977 --> 02:28:59,098
[SPEAKER_11]: I argued, saying that it was under fair use.

2016
02:29:00,179 --> 02:29:01,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and the audio's back.

2017
02:29:02,740 --> 02:29:03,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

2018
02:29:03,741 --> 02:29:04,321
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, look at that.

2019
02:29:04,401 --> 02:29:05,502
[SPEAKER_11]: See, arguing works.

2020
02:29:07,512 --> 02:29:08,833
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you don't get our account closed

2021
02:29:29,811 --> 02:29:32,133
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a quick last minute sort of like update.

2022
02:29:32,513 --> 02:29:38,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Every year at Orange Lounge Radio, our friends over at Understation Live do their March Madness.

2023
02:29:38,876 --> 02:29:43,919
[SPEAKER_04]: But now they call it, I think they just call it USL Madness because it doesn't always happen in March.

2024
02:29:44,359 --> 02:29:47,821
[SPEAKER_04]: But all the, you might remember a few weeks ago we got some phone calls.

2025
02:29:47,841 --> 02:29:49,181
[SPEAKER_04]: They were collecting the top 25 games.

2026
02:29:50,282 --> 02:30:19,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Well they compiled that and they got the first brackets up So some of the games are now doing battle So if you want to check that out, go to Orange Lounge Radio And go to our forums And you'll see there's a whole forum for March Madness And it says 2009 because we can't figure out how to update it But it actually is all the posts for 2010 And you can see all the brackets And you can vote in the first round But voting closes tomorrow night, Monday night So you can choose, like for instance I'll read a few of these matchups that are going on right now Civilization vs. Time Crisis Which is better?

2027
02:30:21,085 --> 02:30:23,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Halo 2 vs. Para Para Paradise

2028
02:30:25,359 --> 02:30:31,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Contra vs. Final Fantasy X Final Fantasy vs. Final Fantasy VIII Final Fantasy VIII

2029
02:30:50,831 --> 02:31:01,840
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be too late, but you can go vote in the next round and have your voice heard on what is truly the best video game of all time, according to the OLR Network.

2030
02:31:03,092 --> 02:31:06,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2031
02:31:06,573 --> 02:31:10,214
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we're done a little bit early tonight, but that's the way it goes sometimes.

2032
02:31:10,254 --> 02:31:12,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes we have a lot to say, sometimes we don't have as much to say.

2033
02:31:12,615 --> 02:31:15,476
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to wrap it all up and get on out of here for the night.

2034
02:31:15,876 --> 02:31:18,717
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.

2035
02:31:19,178 --> 02:31:20,758
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll start with my final thought tonight.

2036
02:31:20,838 --> 02:31:24,719
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is I should go to the arcade or something, play some arcade games.

2037
02:31:24,739 --> 02:31:25,260
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be fun.

2038
02:31:25,560 --> 02:31:26,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't been in a while.

2039
02:31:26,160 --> 02:31:26,780
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds like fun.

2040
02:31:26,800 --> 02:31:27,420
[SPEAKER_04]: It does sound like fun.

2041
02:31:27,901 --> 02:31:28,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe after moving.

2042
02:31:29,241 --> 02:31:30,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Sakura, your final thought.

2043
02:31:30,902 --> 02:31:31,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Typography is life.

2044
02:31:32,825 --> 02:31:33,827
[SPEAKER_04]: And Loki, your final thought?

2045
02:31:35,269 --> 02:31:36,911
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really funny how... Your mic's off.

2046
02:31:38,233 --> 02:31:40,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Really funny how my mic was off.

2047
02:31:40,636 --> 02:31:47,727
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that just a simple little instructional guide on eHow can get your YouTube video back up even though it has copyright music in it.

2048
02:31:50,427 --> 02:31:51,207
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you next time.

2049
02:32:19,122 --> 02:32:21,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we'll be back to do it all again next week.

2050
02:32:21,264 --> 02:32:22,465
[SPEAKER_04]: It is Valentine's Day.

2051
02:32:22,826 --> 02:32:24,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows what's going to happen next week.

2052
02:32:24,607 --> 02:32:25,448
[SPEAKER_04]: So tune in.

2053
02:32:25,888 --> 02:32:29,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Until then, that does it for another week here at Orange Lounge Studios.

2054
02:32:29,431 --> 02:32:30,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a great week.

2055
02:32:30,032 --> 02:32:32,875
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you next Sunday for more of Orange Lounge Radio.

2056
02:32:36,858 --> 02:32:37,318
[SPEAKER_07]: See you next week!

2057
02:33:04,712 --> 02:33:05,915
Thanks for watching!
