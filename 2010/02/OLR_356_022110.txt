Night, February 21st, 2010 Nintendo hits Australian piracy again EA is going to shut down more servers And a recent HD fighting game is being ported to the iPhone
Hello, my friends on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the video game podcast where every gamer has a voice.
We are live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
Thanks to the folks at All Games Radio for letting us steal their bandwidth every week right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, live on Sunday nights.
My name is Rob Roberts.
I'll be joining you over the next few hours.
With me, as always, say hello to my one and only co-host, Dark Sakura.
One and only.
Well, you know, one and only sidekick.
I don't know, because I always introduce Loki as Tech Master Loki.
He's still a co-host, but that's just the way it is.
You made him spit out his chicken.
I'm sorry.
Loki knows I love him.
Not in a, you know, no homo.
Isn't that what the rappers say now?
I think I was seeing something the other day where, I don't know, some rappers were talking about, you know, yeah, yeah, you look really good in that outfit, no homo.
Although I am a homo, if you haven't already heard, so whatever.
This show's off to a very strange start already tonight.
It's not just the bandwidth issues, is it?
Yeah, so anyway, how you doing, DarkSakura?
I'm doing.
All right.
And, of course, the one and only Techmaster Loki is here as well.
Hello.
How you doing, Loki?
Good.
All right.
So we're going to be talking video games, of course, over the next few hours with you guys at our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
And I want to apologize in advance.
Live radio tonight, I don't know what's going on.
We're having some bandwidth issues on all games, and I think it's kind of why we're off.
It's not all games' fault, though.
They're perfect, because Bobby had a flawless show last night.
DarkSakura, Luke, Carameldansen
Alright, so we also have a special guest here in the studio tonight And it's not often we get guests at Studio DarkSakura, besides Shermie of course But sometimes you have Dan, and I know Tiara's been here before as well But tonight we have another special guest, say hello everybody to Salacious Pop Hello, how are you?
I'm good, how are you?
Good, now it's funny that I was talking about Nohomo earlier Because Salacious Pop happens to be my boyfriend That's right, I brought my boyfriend to the show tonight, so how are you?
I'm great.
Yes.
So tell the listeners a little bit about yourself and video games like what you're into.
Like what kind of video games do you play without like telling us about your gaming week?
What would you say would be like your favorite video game and the types of stuff you're into?
Music and rhythm games, RPGs and adventure games.
What would you say is your favorite video game ever?
Valkyrie Profile.
Why?
The art direction, the story, the multiple endings, and the music.
How did you get into video games?
Did you get into video games when you were older, or was it something you've had a controller in your hands since you were born, or what?
I think I got an Atari 2600 when I was about 6 or 7 years old.
And from there I graduated up to the NES and Super NES and played all these Sierra online games and that was it.
Very cool.
And of course the chat room is chiming in here.
Leachum6 in chat says, does that mean plus homo?
I guess.
I don't know.
Whatever.
We're just, you know what?
We like video games.
That's the important thing here.
So...
Yeah, we're going to talk about video games over the next few hours.
The latest that's going on in video games and news and everything.
I don't know what it is.
Tonight is just an off night.
I don't know if it's like the bandwidth or what, but I just feel kind of off and it has nothing to do with Alan being here.
Maybe I'm cracking under the pressure.
I don't know.
Is it different being here?
Because you've listened to the show before, obviously, right?
You've commented in chat.
Is it different being here in studio than it is listening?
Absolutely.
How is it different?
Dan's in the other room, I'm nervous.
All right, well, don't be nervous.
And even Loki.
Loki seems a little off tonight, too.
What's going on, Loki?
Because I asked Loki a question earlier.
He has malaria.
He got a little bitchy with me.
Like, it's not... Loki's not usually the bitchy one.
DarkSakura, she's the bitchy one.
Loki... I didn't get bitchy.
I was joking.
You were a little bitchy.
I was joking.
Oh, okay.
Yeah, that's what I tell Dan once a month.
She's like, well, someone didn't give me the stories that I put in there.
I'm like, well, that's too bad.
but here's the thing here's the thing the listeners have to know is that Loki although I know he kind of gets branded as the angry one on the show like you know because he does his little rants when it's appropriate and he's like the angry guy on the show like he's actually like if you meet him in real life he's one of like the nicest people you'll ever meet seriously like I really mean that like Loki goes out of his way to help people you know he's that guy you can call when your computer's broken or you know that tech guy everybody knows that you can call right?
I'm the angry one
Yeah, and Jamie's usually the angry one.
But tonight is weird because Loki was kind of like, you know...
Well, I don't know.
Too bad.
And then Jamie's like, I'm going to knit the listeners a sweater.
Well, no.
It was just like she wanted to put stories in and I forgot to put them on there.
And I'm like, well, I can't do anything about it now.
It's no big deal.
I don't think anyone cares.
I was trying to be funny.
I wasn't like, damn you, woman.
Why are you complaining?
It's never like that.
How can I be mad?
I have chicken.
No, how can anybody be mad?
I don't know.
And Rob brought churro chips.
That's right.
These delicious... I'm going to endorse these.
They don't pay me, but these chips are delicious.
I think I would like another couple of them, please.
They're Stacy's Cinnamon Sugar Pita Chips, and they're delicious.
And I bought them at Walgreens.
No, wait, wait, wait.
Get back in here.
Wait, is... A Dan approaches?
Get your butt back in here.
Throw the pester ball at Dan.
See if he can catch his attention.
Pester, pester.
Bother, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother.
Dan!
Dan was just trying to say hi to Alan
If it's your 50th time listening, I'm sorry.
Alright, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
It was a lot of Star Trek Online because I have a new graphics card.
Or really, I have someone else's old graphics card, but it's new to me.
In fact, the box of it is sitting right behind you.
Indeed.
Oh, it's the GeForce 9800 GTX Plus Black Edition with bells and whistles and crack, you know, falling out of it.
Have you overclocked it yet?
No.
You should.
We'll see.
because it's easy and it's extra juice.
We'll see.
Okay.
Why don't you overclock the card, woman?
Don't you know what you're doing?
Well... I couldn't resist.
It went in on Wednesday.
Since then, I've had a friend in the hospital.
I'm sorry.
I've had homework.
I've had a meeting.
Is your friend okay?
Is this someone I know?
Are they okay?
I don't think... No, you've met him.
Um...
One of my friends from Temple, he went in with something with his heart.
I'll tell you more offline.
So I went to see him at the hospital, and I've been trying to play Star Trek Online today, but my internet's been kind of... So every time I would pick a system to go to, it would...
Okay, you know on Ragnarok Online, when you would have a hiccup, and your character would just suddenly back up like a bajillion miles back from wherever you were before?
I understand, but I'll bet you maybe 1% of the listenership understands.
Well, it'd be like, my ship would hiccup, it would backtrack, so you'd actually see the trails going backwards ahead of the ship, and it would change direction, and I'm like, what the hell?
So basically your computer was telling you, I can't keep it moving, I don't have the power!
It wasn't even letting, giving me any option to enter the system when I was manually controlling it to go there.
I was like, well crap, I can't, you know, level, but I started my Klingon the other night and that was pretty cool.
I have Klingon now.
So the system was down.
The system is down.
The system is down.
Okay.
I was also playing little clone games on my Linux box.
I was playing, I think it was called Penguin Freeze or something.
And it's best to move with penguins.
And they had Kinect 4.
And I was playing Minesweeper.
And the little, you know... A socially awkward penguin in the game?
I guess.
Yeah.
and then um I was playing Puzzle Bobble in Flash which is pretty fun and um that's about it yeah alright and I slept
Techmaster Loki, how was your gaming week?
Actually, before I get to that, I should say some of the people in chat are commenting on the exchange earlier about the switching personalities night.
SJ100Matt, go USA in chat.
That's right, it's Olympics time.
SJ100Matt says, Loki missed posting stories, but at least he has chicken.
Loki Jenkins.
I just wanted honey barbecue chicken every now and then to get the craving for.
There's nothing wrong with chicken.
You know, I kind of have a cold right now, so it was the only thing that sounded good.
Chicken and vitamin C. Orange chicken.
Yeah.
Orange chicken, yeah.
There you go.
Um, let's see, this week, didn't play a whole lot of stuff.
I did put in a good five hours worth of Borderlands, so yesterday, so that was fun.
Um, started doing, uh, Mad Moxie's Underdome Riot, and it's very tedious.
Although, I did play one round with a friend, um, earlier in the week during lunch, and it was actually pretty fun co-op, but single player, man, it's pretty boring.
But, um...
It was cool, so I played that a little bit, and I'm just kind of working through Borderlands still.
It's still very fun, and I can't wait for the next expansion to come out.
That'll be pretty cool.
Although, what a weird level cap, though.
They capped it at 61 in the new expansion.
Huh.
It's like, okay...
Well, maybe there's going to be four more expansions.
So it'll be 62 and then 63.
It's still dumb, but 61, okay, that's what you want to stop at.
Fine with me.
And then, of course, more Grand Theft Auto.
In fact, actually, I want to say that I'm in the top 200 now for cumulative...
I'm not really sure about that, but I know for a fact, though, I'm in like the mid-70s now for true skill rankings, so I'm in the top 75 players in the world.
So that's pretty awesome.
And if one of our listeners wants to serve you a slice of humble pie, how can they do that?
Find me online.
We play just ranked games now.
So if you happen to be playing a ranked game around 10, 10.30-ish, 3, 3.30, and then sometime between noon and 1, depending if we're playing during lunch, you should be able to find us because there's no one on there.
So it's pretty easy.
We have four systems, and we're able to get into ranked games together easy.
So...
Thanks for watching!
I don't know.
QQ more.
They make fun of me.
They're like, what?
Like, they'll get ahead or something and they'll be just like, oh, you're just sucking it up today, blah, blah, blah.
I'm like, alright, now I gotta kill you.
See how they go and do that.
And now you're just gonna learn the lesson that's involved with, you know, criticizing my plane.
And that is...
Death.
Lots and lots of death.
In very humiliating ways.
So yeah.
Alright.
My gaming week, not a whole lot to report on.
I moved this week though.
I have a really good excuse.
I have a new place that I'm living at and I'm still without internet.
So not even a lot of WoW this weekend.
It's kind of sad.
But I did play a little bit of WoW of course earlier in the week.
I mean, come on.
It's me we're talking about.
I was playing that right up until they unplugged the internet.
And then after that, probably my other big gaming thing was that I actually went to Roseville Golf Land this week The great place where video games go to die Although I have to say, the games I was interested in playing were all working fine And I did play lots and lots of Beatmania Distorted And I was playing the old school songs in Distorted But I know Alan tried playing King of Fighters What was wrong?
You were playing King of Fighters 98 or something?
What were you playing there?
Yeah, it was King of Fighters 2003 Okay
and the first player side had a button missing and the second player side couldn't move left or forward when you're second player so that was a great time.
That's so easy to fix too though.
Imagine trying to play a fighting game without moving forward.
You know what this means?
Photo time again.
But I gotta say, the 2DX machine worked fine.
And all the music games actually seemed to be in really good shape.
You were playing DJ Max Technica.
Yeah, that was working fine, right?
Let me give you an example of how long it's been since I've been there.
They didn't have the 2DX machine set up the last time I was there.
You know what?
Not a lot's changed, I gotta be honest.
It's, you know, a lot of Ticket Redemption machines still, and this is really true of any arcade I could probably mention.
It's mostly Ticket Redemption machines.
It's a safe bet.
Yeah.
I did play a little bit, Alan and I sparred on Mario Kart, and, you know, it's nothing like Mario Kart, the home version.
You know, I've been wanting to play the second one.
because they have a second GPRK but yeah the GPRK ones are kind of boring actually but hey port them in the home systems make them playable online oh wait asking too much alright so that was pretty much my gaming week not a lot of exciting stuff because you know without me moving right now hopefully I'll have more next week I know I will in two weeks when Final Fantasy XIII is out so just wait Alan how was your it's only two weeks away I know it's exciting it is exciting it's so exciting alright Alan how was your gaming week what did you play
I played a lot of WoW because for some reason someone got me into that.
I don't know who.
So lots of WoW.
Logged into my City of Heroes characters.
I still play that.
The next expansion, Going Rogue, is actually due out in July.
So I just logged in to get re-familiarized myself with my characters.
Played some Gyromancer, the DLC, the extra hard maps.
Now that it works.
Yes, now that it works.
And Valkyrie Profile DS is really what I'm playing right now.
Very cool.
City of Heroes real quick, because it's not a game we've talked a lot about on the show.
I think we've all kind of like dabbled in it a little bit.
I've got the Architect Edition in my closet.
I know you kind of played it like a little bit, but not like extensively, right?
What does City of Heroes have?
Because you're obviously still playing it while you're juggling WoW.
What does City of Heroes have for you in an MMO that WoW is lacking?
The ability to come up with a very strong character concept and the costume designer is so powerful that you can pretty much have a completely unique character.
Oh, I love that.
I downloaded that little Korean client that you could just play with all day and not have to even have an account.
That was so much fun.
and I did notice that when you were showing me your thing like how you could like go in a phone booth and you'd have like the different costumes you could save like five different costume presets it didn't seem to affect your abilities at all whatsoever at least that I noticed I don't know maybe it did and then like you had a little bio written on your character and you'd actually kind of written a whole little thing and I was thinking this is like an RP type of player's
City of Heroes has an amazing RP community, and I think it's almost a six-year-old game.
And for them to be releasing a major expansion six years after the fact, there has to be the money there and the subscriptions, and it's mostly the RPers that are sticking around.
And WoW's probably been around about five, six years.
It just had its fifth anniversary, so it's been around about as long.
Yeah, City of Heroes was huge for the first six or seven months, and then when WoW came out, there was sort of a big vacuum.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
but there's definitely you know there's always going to be those diehards that just love the game and I think especially when you bring that RP component into it you know I don't know I mean Final Fantasy XI had somewhat you could do I mean you could do the RP with any game but I could see where City of Heroes really lets you embrace that you know Final Fantasy XI if you think WoW is limited with how your character can look Final Fantasy XI is really limiting too so
Well, I have to say that, you know, the moment I moved on to Star Trek Online, I forgot about World of Warcraft.
Really, I did.
Okay, then let me ask you the same question I asked Alan.
What is it about Star Trek Online that had it for you that WoW didn't?
Or is it just, I know you love Star Trek, is it just the fandom, period?
It's really not just the fandom, it's the fact that I really can play by myself.
It's annoying as fuck to party with people.
Really, it's annoying.
It pisses me off.
I hate doing it.
Even when it's one of my friends, after an hour of following behind somebody, I'm like, okay, I'm tired of this.
This is monotonous.
Whereas in Star Trek Online, it's like when you are doing your instances, you go into an area and you may have three people already there, complete strangers, and you can run through your series of instances together.
When you're done with it, that's it.
You don't have to really hang out with them.
You don't have to follow them around.
You can do your own thing.
Like, I had one person go into one instance, and I went to a completely different one, and we all got, you know, the points for it, because we, it was still, we were working together.
And that's what I like, is it's sort of, it's teamwork, but you can choose if you want to do a fleet mission or, and it's, and it feels like an episode.
It's got enough random in it that it really keeps my interest in it.
I hate PvP.
You know, but I gotta admit, from a WoW standpoint, you know, I realize not everybody's into it, which is cool, but for me, why I like WoW is that it is such a robust game.
You know, I can just log in, it's like, oh, I'm gonna just go slip right into a dungeon, or, you know, nobody else is online, maybe I'll go PvP by myself, or, hey, Alan's online, we're gonna go quest together, and it's like we're hanging out, but we're not, because we're nerds.
I totally don't mind doing PvP if I get to smash some Klingons in the face.
I just can't wait until we get the Romulan and Cardassian missions.
Is that like a future expansion?
Yeah, I think that's going to be a future thing.
I will play some more Star Trek online, but see, there's this big thing kind of hovering in the distance, and that is Final Fantasy XIV.
And I just know, like, I have to play it.
I have to.
I sucked three years.
I mean, if you guys think I talk about WoW a lot, you should have been on the show.
3, 4 years ago.
Like, do you remember when we used to talk about the fairy server?
I mean, that's old school, okay?
I used to play with you.
I know, we used to talk.
I mean, I used to just talk about Final Fantasy XI all the freaking time on this show.
So, I mean, I have to try XIV just because I sunk so much time into XI.
Well, you know, I gave XI a really good try.
I mean, you were here watching me play, doing the freaking macros on my controller.
But if you hate grouping with people, XI stinks.
It does.
I mean, XI is about forced...
and me.
To be fair, they fixed a lot of that years later after I left with the level sync and everything.
My big problem with that one is just that maybe it was because I was playing the White Mage.
Maybe it was because I was the party bitch.
You know?
And I've told this story before.
The final straw for that game was me calling everybody over with my little dinky... Okay, I will go back.
Actually, playing with Japanese players is not annoying.
They know how to party.
If you know what I mean.
They're the only ones that would respect a bard.
That's right.
I remember when you tried to play a bard.
Dude, I was a pimp-ass bard, but, you know... No one wanted to play the bard.
I rocked the bard.
Audience, if you would...
See, here's your proof.
Angry Loki.
When you talk about, you know, some of the hacking and the stuff, he gets angry Loki.
I rocked the bard.
What angry man says that?
Remember, you can also swap out the music and stuff in there because there was that little trick you could do.
And so I would have, like, smack my bitch up to, like, the battle music.
It was awesome.
I remember when you would mount up on the chocobo and it would play the theme from The NeverEnding Story.
Thanks for watching!
Oh, yes.
Oh, that's fun.
Well, what my story was, as I was saying.
Sorry.
It's okay.
No, I think that's funny.
It was worth it.
Smack my bitch up.
Anyway, so my little character, you know, because when you throw out your macros, you can call everyone in your party to come back to you so that you can do an area effect buff.
And I was finally like, I did the buff, everything, then this one comes in, hey, I'm in a buff.
I'm like, fuck you.
Log out.
And that was it.
I never played again.
I totally forgot about Falkor's Ride or whatever it said to the Chocobo thing.
It was awesome.
It was very epic.
This was when Loki and I lived together, and, like, we had our computers, like, kind of, like, right next to each other, like, they're here in the studio.
So, you know, I'd be doing my thing in Final Fantasy XI, and then, like, I'm like, okay, because, you know, Loki and I would play together sometimes because we're nerds, right?
And I'd say, like, okay, Loki, come meet me in Alteppa Desert and let's party.
And, like, Loki's fanfare is, like, coming from the computer.
Bring your harp!
I did that though with Ragnarok for a little while because it's all mp3s so you could change out the music so I remember going into it was this one place that used to have this big epic music and it was like instead it was a bassoon quartet
There was another one.
The group party music that I had was the battle music.
It wasn't the theme of Zanarkand or whatever, but from Final Fantasy XI.
Oh, it was the jacked, angry music.
I remember that.
Otherworld.
It was awesome.
I don't remember that from Final Fantasy X. I remember it from your freaking every time.
Because I was a healer, so I never really engaged the monster.
but like, you know, when you, I think you finally started Black Mage instead of Bard, and you know, we'd be fighting, you know, the killer level 60 rabbit, or whatever and then like, okay engage the rabbit, doo doo doo doo doo, like you just had the most epic bunny killing music I'd ever heard in my life I just hope that's the only thing that they include from Final Fantasy XI in XIV is the ability to change the music you're not supposed to be able to do that, you just like to hack things, yes alright
Anyhow, boy, we're not even into the gaming news yet.
You know what?
If I was going to do that, then my battle music would be bitches.
Mindless self-indulgence.
I don't know what mine would be.
What would be some good battle music for me, Alan?
I'm trying to think for Final Fantasy XIV if I could hack the music.
What are you guys talking about?
Anyhow Actually Shaoran in the chat room I hope I pronounced that right Chat.orangewatchradio.com has a suggestion If Star Trek Online had a customizable music OLR would need to bring in I'm on a boat I would totally do that for the You know how they have the ferries you can take
Oh yeah, I remember the first time taking a ferry in Final Fantasy XI.
I got on the little ferry because getting around in Final Fantasy XI kind of sucks.
It takes like 30 minutes to get from one thing to the other.
So you'd get on the boat.
I remember the first time I ever took a boat ride.
It's like do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
Happy little boat music and then all of a sudden it gets really dark.
Do-do-do-do-do-do.
Oh, we freaking got raided by pirates.
The first time I ever rode a boat in the game.
But I remember that being an epic moment of Final Fantasy XI.
I was like, that was actually really cool that the boats will randomly get raided by pirates.
You would have to, as a low-level character, literally run and hide in the basement.
I think I had to.
Because you came and got me one time.
While someone drags a kraken down the stairs.
Anyhow.
I have to say, though, I still, to this day, remember the look on your face when I was doing my macros on my controller.
I was very impressed with the way you were doing the... And then I couldn't.
That's what I hated in World of Warcraft.
I couldn't use my damn controller.
Final Fantasy XI was built for the PS2.
And I have to remember, using a controller, that's the way most of the Japanese players do it.
And some American ones as well, obviously.
But I cannot imagine that game without a computer keyboard.
Anyway.
I agree with Ranma.
When did this become Final Fantasy Radio?
I don't know.
So let's move on.
Let's get into some housekeeping tonight and talk a little bit about what's going on with OLR before we get into the gaming news tonight.
I don't have a whole lot of show-specific news besides...
Don't forget that you can always join us on our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, and of course we're on Facebook as well, Orange Lounge Radio there, add us as your friend, and we will usually make updates, except tonight, because with all the internet hiccup we had earlier, we didn't get onto many of the social networking, but...
Also, we got a voicemail from Breslul, and he wants to update you guys on USL Madness and what is going on there in our forums.
So I want to go to the voicemail, and uh-oh, did I delete it?
I hope not.
Oops, when we did the reboot earlier, I might have deleted his voicemail.
Whoopsie, let's see if I can get to it here.
And here we go, here's his voicemail.
Here's a voicemail from Breslul about what is going on in USL Madness at our forums at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
Hello Orange Lounge Radio, it's Brest Law once again reminding you, three hosts, and the listeners to give us some votes here on USL Madness.
We have some fantastic matchups in the round of 32.
We've got a heated one between Final Fantasy 7 and Pokemon.
Mega Man 2 is facing Mega Man 3 in one of the most bizarre matchups of the tournament.
Ocarina of Time vs. Tecmo Super Bowl, Earthbound vs. Secret of Mana.
I could go on, but there's not enough time in the show.
but please visit our forums, get yourself an account and vote today because half of these games go away and then next week is the Sweet 16 where things get incredibly interesting.
Once again, log on to our forums and vote.
We'll talk to you later and USL will be back on the... This is it.
Let me try that again.
USL will be back on February 27th.
We'll see you then.
Till then!
That was Bress Lowell from Under Sedation Live, Saturday nights at AllGamesRadio, AllGamesRadio.com, or if you want just the radio feed, it's AllGamesRadio.com.
And they'll be back on Saturday.
But yeah, Bress Lowell and Travis, they team up with us to do this USL Madness, which is kind of like a take on March Madness, if you don't know what it is, where they try to define the greatest video game of all time.
And everybody submits their lists, and then he seeds it like it was basketball games and
And Guardian Legend wins.
Guardian Legend wasn't even in the top 64 on people's list.
It was on my list.
I had it in my top 25 games of all time, but I guess that wasn't enough.
Because, admittedly, it wasn't number one.
Sorry, Jamie.
But, yeah, as he said in the voicemail, there's some pretty epic matchups going on right now.
Like Mega Man 2 versus Mega Man 3.
How do you even decide between those two games?
Mega Man 2.
Practically the same guy.
Mega Man 2.
I said 2 as well.
What is it that draws you to 2 over 3, though?
I like the number 2 better than the 3.
Bubble Man Stage Music Metal Blades I think it's just the fact that well for me and the way I rationalized it when I voted on the forums was that Mega Man 2 was kind of set the bar like obviously Mega Man 1 was the original but you know it had all these things like scoring and less bosses and kind of a different interface and everything Mega Man 2 kind of really polished that and really Mega Man 3 is just Mega Man 2 with some new frills in it but Mega Man 2 was so important that those bosses came back in 3
Mega Man 2 was one of my big accomplishments because I used to be able to do the dragon level blindfolded.
I remember you telling me about that.
I used to be able to play that game through in one sitting.
It's all about timing with that level.
The only other game I've been able to do that with is World 8-1 and Super Mario Bros.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Final Fantasy 7 is, it seems like a lot of the vote isn't, I mean, I could be wrong, but there's a lot of vote that is not for Pokemon so much as it is against Final Fantasy 7 because of all the fanboy wank.
And I was trying to figure out, like, why that is.
Because, like, I don't think Final Fantasy 7 is the best Final Fantasy, but certainly, like, it was the game that got me to buy a PlayStation.
It was, you know... I owned that game before I had a PlayStation.
How does that work?
My roommate had one.
Oh.
And, yeah, you know, I just remember it just changed the way you kind of perceive Final Fantasy games because it was so different from the sprite-based ones.
But I agree the fan wank got a little crazy, but I can't hold that against the game.
But I don't know.
But then you look at a series like Pokemon, and that's like a cult.
That's like, I don't even know.
Like, Pokemon sucks people in and doesn't let them go.
It's like, I don't get it.
Yeah, I don't know.
But yeah, whatever.
I can't be mad, I guess.
That's what happens.
Every gamer has a voice, even when that voice is whack.
www.orangeloungeradio.com No disrespect to the Pokemon fans.
To me, they're kind of all the same game.
They are all the same game.
Look!
Oh my god, we discovered new Pokemon that are no way similar to the other Pokemon.
Buy more games.
Before you send in the hate mail, though...
I was there when the first movie came out in theaters.
I went and saw it opening night, okay?
I think I went with you, didn't I?
No, I went in Chico.
No, that's right, because I got the import.
You might have went to the second one with me, because I went and saw the second one, too.
I saw the third one with you at the theater.
Probably.
But I had to import a copy of the Japanese one.
So, yeah, don't send in the hate mail.
Pokemon's fine.
I just...
Where are they going to go with it?
They just make more Pokemon.
If they made an MMO, I'd try it.
I would.
For the record, I still think Digimon's cooler.
All right, let's get into some gaming news.
We're like, what, 30 minutes in the show after a 15-minute late start.
We haven't even covered news yet.
This is going to be a 10 o'clock at night show.
That's 1 a.m.
for you East Coasters.
Let's get started on some gaming news, Loki.
Okay, so the ESA did a survey.
I shouldn't really say a survey, but they did research focusing on 200 specific titles during the month of December.
Not necessarily stuff that came out in December, but just during that month.
And it showed that of those 200 titles, there were 9.78 million illegal downloads for those titles during the month of December.
And you might think, okay, well, maybe the U.S.
is to blame because there's a lot of people in the U.S.
that pirate.
But actually, no, there's other countries that were a lot higher.
In fact, the highest number of unauthorized downloads came from Italy with 20.3% of the total, Spain following that with 12.5%, France with 7.5%, and China with 5.7%.
I blame Luxembourg
The countries I think of are not the ones you're naming.
Like, I usually think, you know, because of the stereotypes about being able to buy bootlegs in Hong Kong, like right on the street corners, and, you know, knowing of all that that goes on, I would think it's like Hong Kong, Taiwan, those would be the types of places that would be the tops for piracy, but Italy?
Now, pardon my ignorance for those overseas listeners, but I've never even been over to the other side of the Atlantic, so sorry, I know we have a lot of listeners over there because we try to
Let every gamer have a voice, including our friends from overseas.
But is there something about Italy where the distribution that gets to the rest of Europe doesn't get there or something?
I have no idea.
But they said also that of those 10 million, those aren't even really a full picture of what's being downloaded.
I think it's just all Modern Warfare 2 is probably what it was.
well because my thought is you know is that I've gotten into this topic before and I don't know if it was on a call with Bobby's show at the end or if it was on this show but that I think a lot of this piracy comes from folks that can't get the game through legal means turn to piracy and that's why I kind of question well does Italy get game releases when the rest of you know those countries over there get them or is there something about Italy where in Spain and some of those other countries you named where they don't get the games at the same time so people turn to piracy
Are there laws where maybe the game has to be in a local language, like Italian or Spanish, so they can't release them there?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't really hear a lot of just, you know, I don't really hear of anything being delayed there, but I mean, I don't really know.
We never hear like, you know, Italy's not getting the game because it's been censored or something like that.
It's always Germany or New Zealand or Australia.
They got to catch them all.
Well, I would love to hear from a listener, because I know we have some listeners over there.
So if you are listening and you're one of those countries Loki named, I would love to get an email from you.
Why do you think piracy is so rampant where you live?
I mean, is the legal just difficult or expensive or what?
Because I think...
I don't know, why do people turn to piracy in the US?
Because they blame the $60 price point of a console game.
I'm too poor, I'm a starving student, or whatever it is.
Try to justify it with the whole Robin Hood philosophy of steal from the rich and give to the poor.
That's what motivates most piracy.
I'm not saying a good thing about that, I'm just saying what I see.
That's just kind of what it seems to be.
It's the whole Robin Hood approach.
Anyhow, well, be careful.
I don't think it's as altruistic as Robin Hood's intent.
It's rob from the rich and give to me.
Okay, fair enough.
Speaking of piracy, you might want to be a little bit careful if you're into that.
Keep in mind, piracy is not legal.
Just a reminder.
So you are walking a dangerous line.
And that is evidenced by what's going on in Australia right now.
In fact, when I first read this story, I was like,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Apparently, Gadgetgear.com.au, because all the Australian ones ended AU, they were actually told they have to stop selling the device.
They got fined the equivalent of $466,000 US dollars.
The folks that were named in the suit, Patrick Lee and James Lee, I guess they also kind of sold this independently, not through the same site, but they also were fined $100,000 Australian.
That's about $90,000 here Australian.
Also, what I think is interesting as part of the settlement, or I'm sorry, not settlement, but suit, they have to disclose who is supplying the R4 chips.
Hmm.
So that again is just, that's the second in like a week's time of Nintendo winning some anti-piracy stuff.
I think it's dumb that they, you know, I mean, those chips, I understand that they can be used for piracy, but a computer can be used for piracy.
So, you know, we're going to make computers legal now too?
I mean, it's just, you have to go after the, sadly enough, you have to go after the people that are using the pirate stuff.
Or, I don't know, here's a thought, go after people putting ROMs online.
it won't matter if you have the stupid chip for your DS because it won't work with anything there's no fucking ROMs out there
Oddly enough, I kind of agree with you.
And I think your computer analogy, even though I don't own an R4 and I don't think I would get into all this stuff.
I have two and a G3.
I have two Ninja Passes.
Okay.
I feel like I'm too stupid to really get into all that stuff.
I don't know what it is, but I think if I had one, I'd want to play homebrew stuff on it is probably what I would be into.
Yeah, that's pretty fun.
I like having the real deal because then I know I'm going to get online and not get my system bricked and all that.
I'm willing to pay the extra money just for ease of mind in that regard.
But as far as the R4 stuff goes, I think when you buy a device like that, yeah, I should be able to use the parts for whatever I want as long as I'm not – I get the problem with piracy.
You're stealing someone else's property that they spent money to create.
It's going after the wrong people.
But if somebody wants to put a free ROM on the internet for their free public domain, just like somebody puts their music up on MySpace, they want you to download it and listen to it to get their band name out there.
It's just like people, it'd be like going after somebody or a camcorder company because somebody used it to pirate a film.
Thanks for watching!
I don't know.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I even got bored of that.
I shouldn't be getting bored of a Zelda game.
I mean, come on, it's Zelda.
It's awesome.
Do you think maybe your expectations have kind of raised?
No, but they didn't really do that much different other than, look, now Link's riding a train instead of a boat.
I mean, it's the same damn game.
Okay, I'm going to take the tangent train for a minute here, but we kind of got into it a couple weeks ago on the show.
I remember talking about Game Room and some of these old arcade games and Atari 2600 games.
and some folks saying that you know they're repetitive they're boring and I'm thinking that's what it was all about back when you know those games first came out what's wrong with you you know like are we just have our expectations about what makes a good game like changed in that regard I guess they have to some extent you know you it would be like this
It would be like saying, okay, I'm playing Pac-Man.
Pac-Man's cool.
And then we come out with Pac-Man 2, which is exactly the same as Pac-Man 1, except now the screen is blue and purple instead of yellow and blue.
That's basically the difference between... That's Ms.
Pac-Man.
But she has a bow in her hair.
She has a bow, and it's slightly different.
But no, seriously, it's almost like they've said, okay, what can we do to put the least amount of effort into this so we can release a sequel really quick?
And yes, I understand.
Ooh, it's... I mean, they don't even try to tie any of the games storyline-wise together.
Oh, yes, it's another adventurer who happens to look the same as Link, and his name is Link, and now he's gotta go rescue this Princess Zelda, who's not the same Princess Zelda, even though she looked exactly the same as the last game.
Don't they gotta do that in all the Zelda games?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
No, there is a bit more about EA servers being a big clank putting on them.
On March 16th, we have service shutdown for Death Jam for PS3, Godfather for PS3 and Xbox 360, Lord of the Rings Conquest, Mercenaries 2, Need for Speed Carbon on portable, Need for Speed Pro Street PSP, Simpsons for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and
April 15th, Burnout 3, Takedown, Army of Two for PS3, but that's only in Asia.
And, of course, we have a ton of original Xbox being shut down after that and PS2 games.
So, yeah, pretty much everything that's Xbox, PS2 earlier, and Tiger Woods.
So...
You know, I'm surprised that, I mean, there's some of the games on there, like Simpsons, I don't remember there being online for that.
It was funny, though, because even, like, Def Jam Icon, that was one of those games, oh, yeah, you can put your music in there and, you know, play and stuff.
I'm like, oh, yeah, if we put some weird, like, DDR music in there, that'd be really funny, because it's meant for more, like, hip-hop stuff.
Yeah.
Oh, well.
Yeah.
And it's not really surprising.
I mean, it costs money to run the servers.
And if they're not making any more money on these games and new stuff's going to be coming out, what's the point of keeping it around?
There's a lot of companies out there that don't really have these servers that they shut down.
EA is the main one we hear about every now and then.
I think we had one from Sega when they shut down the server for Chromehounds.
Those are the only ones I've heard of for a while.
That's kind of interesting.
Well, and, you know, Xbox original getting shut down is, you know, somewhat notable, you know.
But that's just a matter of time.
But I don't understand, like, current generation stuff, the servers being shut down for them.
I mean, that's just kind of weird.
I can understand, like, you know, okay, yeah, we're moving on to the PlayStation 4, you know, the PlayStation Network for PlayStation 3 is going to have to go away now.
But keep in mind, also looking, again, economy-wise, you know,
A lot of companies are losing money anyway.
If they're trying to mitigate... I fully believe that it's to mitigate cost.
I really do.
I think that's part of it too.
And Loki, as you said earlier, you play Grand Theft Auto and nobody's ever online.
I'm kind of surprised they're not threatening to pull the plug on that.
If people aren't using it, it's costing them to keep the servers up.
They are just not playing what I'm playing.
I see.
There's specific settings because we play with auto-aim off and some newbie players out there like to play with auto-aim on.
That would be me.
And so because of that, anybody that's searching for a game with auto-aim on, they're only going to find auto-aim on games.
So you have to specify that.
Thanks for watching!
for um the battle league atony there's at least 50,000 people on the ranked leaderboards um right now so um there's a lot of people out there it's just you know whether they may be wanting to play just free mode or just you know some other you know deathmatch non-ranked you know team deathmatch who knows
All right, chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to join us.
X-Link reminds us they've also shut down the servers for the PS2 and PC versions of Phantasy Star Universe.
That was another big recent one.
Phantasy Star Universe is starting to disappear, which is a pretty big deal.
But I'm kind of not surprised a lot of the communities on Xbox 360.
Wasn't that the only way you had the voice enabled in it too?
Maybe, yeah.
Well, of course you could always use something like Ventrilo or something on the PC, I suppose.
Well, let's move on.
Now, that doesn't sound too bad right now, but there's a few things, of course, you have to understand.
The system is kind of flawed, and the reason being is, for example, if your connection experiences any sort of issue, whether it be like drop in bandwidth or momentary pause, router reboot, or whatever, the software will immediately boot you out of your game back to the main menu, and you'll lose all your progress.
And that's it.
Also, if Ubisoft's master servers encounter any errors, then all the players with a working connection logged into the servers will not be able to play their games until the servers are back online.
Oh gee, Ubisoft's customer support isn't about to blow up or anything.
So, you know... Doesn't Ubisoft make the, like, Imagine games?
Yes, they do.
Okay, so I imagine there's equivalents of that on the PC, right?
Well, the main... The two titles that are going to be coming up... And this is a Korean PC game where they tested...
The two upcoming titles, Assassin's Creed 2 and Settlers 7.
I don't think they have any Imagine games for a PC, but they would have this DRM if they did.
And that's where I'm going with this.
Not everybody that would be buying a game like that is tech-savvy enough to understand what DRM even is.
Certainly not.
The type of people that buy those Imagine games are probably not the same people that listen to this podcast, unless of course they're buying it for their kids.
You know...
My point is, you're going to have these moms buying it for their daughters and people that don't really follow gaming or understand what DRM even is that just know the game isn't going to fire up on the computer.
Who's going to get the phone call about that?
The phone calls are going to go to Ubisoft or they're going to go to Targets and Walmarts across the country.
And when that starts happening, they're going to stop carrying it.
Exactly, and I have a feeling that this will be cracked in probably a few days.
Well, usually those types of things are, and people are going to turn to that.
And sadly, what's going to end up happening?
But unfortunately, soccer mom Jones, who buys this for her daughter, you'll imagine, I don't know, dress-up shop or whatever they come out with.
How many of those Imagine games are there?
We were at Target last night.
Too many.
How many of those Imagine games were there on the shelf, Alan?
Like 5,000, right?
At least a dozen, yeah.
What were some Imagine titles that caught your eye?
Right next to Cooking Mama, 1, 2, 3, and Gardening Mama, and just everything.
Crazy.
Anyhow, while we're talking about online authentication, I think this is kind of interesting.
It's almost like a combination of the past couple stories we've been hearing about server costs to maintain, as well as a little bit about the DRM.
Socom, Fireteam, Bravo 3.
If you are going to be playing this game on the PSP, you're going to get a code so that you can go and redeem it on the PlayStation Network and you'll be able to access the game online.
But if you don't buy this game either directly through PSM because it will automatically be enabled or you get the code new, you'll have to shell out $20 to get the license to let you play online.
Think about that for a minute.
What that basically means is
they're kind of targeting people who are going after this used or the people who buy this second hand because think about it if you buy it new you'll get a code if you buy it online you don't need a code because you bought it online but if you buy it used no code for you well it's for piracy really
DarkSakura.com
Sony actually has a workaround for it in their own system.
And the reason this is, granted, you can't play online games.
But thanks to that wonderful, and I don't remember what the hell it's called now, but remember how you can do ad hoc over the internet with Sony PlayStation 3?
Well, guess I don't need to go online to play other people online.
I can just go ad hoc over the internet, and it works just fine.
It's not lag city or anything?
No, it shouldn't be.
Interesting.
by the way John Culler from Sony actually was quoted to IGN saying it's quote a trial run for a new initiative we are exploring for the platform so even if you're like ah fuck it I don't play SOCOM this could still be in the future impacting a game you play they're waiting to see how long it's cracked and it probably will get cracked somehow
You don't think the used thing has anything to do with it?
Oh, I'm sure that it has a little bit to do with it.
That's why they also were testing out the market with, like, Member Local... Not Local Roku 2.
Patapon 2, I think.
Where they had the game in a retail box, but all it was was a card with a scratch-off code.
Oh, yeah.
I saw that at Fry's, yeah.
You know, so that's another thing.
They were test marketing, so...
I'm just thinking, if I were to pick up this game used, I'd be kind of irritated that then I have to go online and pay another $20.
Like, again, here we go with the angry phone calls from people who don't know better to this time GameStop.
And if I were GameStop, you know, and you can use that term loosely to describe whatever game store makes their bread and butter off of used games and happens to sell new games as well, I'd be kind of pissed.
And I would...
like can you imagine especially with such a powerhouse that GameStop is and we'll just throw in all the other you know like companies in there okay like the powerhouse that they are with something like this kind of going after their used market can you imagine if they were to say and they have the power to do this they run a magazine for heaven's sake they could discourage people from buying the game think about it what's to stop I mean this this might be a little conspiracy theory here but what's to stop GameStop from publishing a negative review in this game
and Game Informer which is the most popular video game magazine out there that happens to be run by GameStop to discourage people from buying this game for no other reason than it cuts into the used game market but yet they use this whole they're going to get to with the $20 thing as the reason but the real reason is the bottom line of the game stores
Thanks for watching!
but I would think at the same time that this could be bad for Sony anyways because when a competing game comes out there let's see, am I going to buy the game that won't let me play online unless I pay $20 or the other game that's equally cool that I can play online for free that's a tough one I will go with the free one
Let's see, TigerClaw in our chatroom, chat.orange.com says, I wonder, what if Sony sells this game in twos?
For example, what if you want to only buy the multiplayer part?
Couldn't you just purchase the multiplayer game itself and not the full single player?
And here's the problem, too, with the SOCOM 3.
It's not...
It's a discounted game.
It's a full-price game.
So, it's not like, hey, we're selling this for $20, but if you want to go online, you can pay the other $20, and then equal the cost of a full-price game.
No, it's nothing like that, where they're offering it at a discount.
It's a full-price game, and then you have to pay another $20 on top of it.
Well, you know what I say.
If you don't like it, don't buy it.
End of story.
I mean, that's really what it is.
If you don't like it, don't buy it.
But, I mean, a game like this, SOCOM has its fan base.
There's people that aren't even going to bat an eye at this because they're already going to buy the game new.
They'll find a way.
We'll see what happens.
Let's move on with some more stories.
We've got release dates coming up as well as the classic game of the week in a little bit here on Orange Launch Radio.
Well, this is some good news.
How about something happy?
Yay, happy.
At least happy for me because I'm playing it.
You're going to give me money?
Yay!
I'm not playing that game.
I'm so happy.
Star Trek.
Star Trek Online.
They are actually working on ways of opening up the ship so that you can explore more of your own ship.
You know, so far all you can do is go hang out on the bridge and that's kind of boring.
You know, I look at my Andorian dude just, you know, piloting.
I'm like, okay, he's piloting.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It is happy for me.
I said it was happy for me.
But they basically want to make it more, you know, do what they can to make it more like actual Star Trek.
And this is something that they've quoted as saying that it's something that they want to do, but they're not going to implement it until they have it working flawlessly.
I want a holodeck.
No.
Starboard Bow, Starboard Bow, Starboard Bow
That was nerdier than what I said.
Um, on Xbox 360, Risen, the ever-delayed game now coming out on Xbox 360.
I believe the PC version came out last October.
Uh, lovely Lisa and Friends on the DS.
Apparently it's from the Tommy Corporation.
I believe it's a doll that's actually in Japan.
Why this is being brought out over here is beyond me.
Because she's lovely.
I guess...
Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii DS, and PSP.
And, of course, that's going to feature all your favorite Sega characters.
And Banjo-Kazooie, of course, in the Xbox 360 version.
Let's see here.
Hello Kitty Birthday Adventures on DS Napoleon Total War coming out on PC Pony Friends 2 coming out on DS Anything our listeners might actually want to buy?
Wait, you're saying Pony Friends 2 is not on the top of their list?
You know, I'm thinking no.
Well, that's too bad.
Heavy Rain coming out on PlayStation 3 this week as well.
And then, let's see, wrapping it up.
Deck of Sports on DS.
Oh, Deck of Sports was the one that had curling in it, right?
Yes, I'm not sure if the DS version has curling in it.
I love Winter Olympics time of year.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Sure.
Alright.
Coming out on February 25th on the Xbox 360, a localized version of Borderlands comes out from 2K Games.
Also a game called Esp Galuda 2.
A black label comes out in limited edition and regular formats.
Of course, there's a 2 there.
It is the sequel to Esp Galuda.
And if you've never heard of it, that's because it's a shmup.
So shoot them up.
Very colorful, seizure-inducing graphics where most of your screen is taken up with an overlay because it's a vertical shooter.
But you know there are some hardcore shmup fans out there.
So I'm sure they'll be picking this up without delay.
Also, No Fate, Only the Power of Will comes out from Alchemist on February the 25th on the Xbox 360.
Not sure what this game's all about.
Of course, it's got anime girls all over it, but this chick who's getting out of the pool is kind of angry.
I don't know why she's so angry.
She's getting out of the pool there.
She looks like Atena.
It's an adventure game, and this other chick's just dreaming.
But I like to think that maybe she is looking at the chick getting out of the pool, and that's what's making her angry.
I don't know.
Anyhow, that made for a much funnier in-studio than it did radio.
I apologize for that.
I snorted my root beer if that makes you feel better.
It does, a little bit.
And there is no curling in DexportsDS.
Fail.
A million times fail.
PlayStation 3, a price reduction on Demon's Souls.
If you haven't picked that up yet, you really should.
It's awesome.
That's pretty much the only thing to look forward to on PlayStation 3 unless you need some new HDMI cables because some third parties are putting some more of those out.
But the Nintendo Wii has a lot this week, which is good because they've had some quiet weeks lately, including Ark Rise Fantasia is coming out.
Minas No Susume selection.
I think that might be just a price reduction then.
I think, yeah, Ark Rise Fantasia I think has already been out.
Just a price reduction there.
It's kind of like a best hits over there.
As far as new games go, Rajironogia Wii.
That's the sequel to Radergy.
I don't know if I'm even saying that right.
Radergy.
Radergy.
There's like an extra R in here.
Another shmup, basically, but this time on the Wii.
Radio Allergy, as it's called over here.
Fushigi no Dungeon, Furai no Shiren 4, Kami no Hitomi no Akuma no Heso
Mystery Dungeon
I don't know if it's a... I don't know what language.
But the guy's wearing kind of a funny hat.
He's got a monkey.
It's the funny hat game featuring monkey.
Also, Super Robot Taisen OG Saga.
There's a series we can't get rid of.
That's right.
It's never going away.
And on the PSP, BlazBlue Portable comes out this week as well as Katekyou Hitman Reborn, Kizuna No Tag Battle, which is, of course, a fighting game.
You can tell they're on the PSP.
I'm not sure if this is based off an anime, but this looks like that one where you can do four people at a time all playing at once.
Looks like fun.
That's going to do it for your Japanese release dates.
Metal Slug XX Metal Slug XX Metal Slug XX Metal Slug
Alright, let's do just a couple more stories and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week and I believe DarkSakura has picked a true classic for you guys tonight.
It better like it.
You know, I picked the most piss your pants title I could think of.
And it ties in with a game that we had coming out this week as well.
We'll get there in a minute.
I don't know why they're... I didn't even know there were sci-fi kids.
Do they make crappy children's shows too?
I didn't know.
Well, they did like a Wizard of Oz and an Alice in Wonderland.
Yeah, which were all really like... They were like dark, weren't they?
They were weird.
Yeah.
I don't know.
So apparently, though, they're going to be working with the Diplob character.
Maybe there'll be a cartoon show.
Who knows?
Will a Cylon show up?
I mean, maybe there's Battlestar Galactica, Caprica.
I don't think there's anything there.
When I think of sci-fi network, I think of BSG.
I can't help it.
I think of crappy sci-fi movies that are normally on there.
That's true.
What is that?
Is that from Sci-Fi Network?
The shark meet octopus?
Or what is it?
The flying shark?
Yeah, where the shark eats a plane out of the sky.
Yes.
Yeah.
That's all those lovely Sci-Fi movies.
Yeah, they show them on the soup all the time, right?
Yeah.
Oh, good times.
With Deborah Gibson.
Yes.
Because, you know, she's a woman now, so no longer Debbie.
That's right.
Um, and then the other thing, of course, the blob is also gonna be not just on the Wii this time, it's also supposed to be coming to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
Um, also, there's gonna be some new Saints Row and Red Faction at E3 this year.
Uh, of course, Saints Row 3 is not supposed to be coming out until 2011, which makes me very sad, but the new Red Faction game is supposed to be slated for later this year, so, um, that might be cool.
And then, um,
So I guess we'll have to wait until E3 to check those out.
Okay, I have to go back to the sci-fi thing for a minute because, like, the blob game, yeah, that's cool.
I remember playing the blob at PAX a couple years ago, of all places.
So, you know, and I remember Loki really enjoyed it, too.
So don't get me wrong.
I'm glad that game is getting a sequel if sci-fi is putting it out or however it's coming out.
But seriously... It's still THQ, yeah.
Why aren't they making, like, the shark and octopus video game?
Like, when Alan was saying that sharks eat planes out of the sky, like, that sounds awesome.
Because the movie was awful.
But...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and you destroy things and Debra Gibson does a voice.
Wouldn't you want to buy that game?
Fuck yes!
See?
Well, okay, they put out the Jaws game, which granted was awesome because you can maybe- Fuck Jaws!
I'm talking- Did Jaws eat a plane out of the sky?
It could've.
No, he chased around Richard Dreyfuss.
Boo hoo.
Landshark.
The guy's got one foot in the grave.
Come on.
Did it have Debra Gibson?
I don't think so.
Chatroom, am I crazy?
Well, we knew that.
No, I mean for real about this.
Chat, would you or would you not want to play that game?
Actdeft in chat says, President Cat vs. Flying Shark Octopus.
There you go.
DarkTetsuya says, Screw President Cat, I want that game.
Look, I am all about these lol what the fuck random games.
You ought to know that by now, listening to this show.
Unless this is your first time listening.
Which again, I apologize.
What is that?
Is that something someone linked to?
Uncovering the secrets of Mega Shark, Death in the Skies.
Hold on, SSJ, I hate to do this in the middle of the show, but SSJ100Matt is linking us to this YouTube, and just knowing SSJ100Matt, I think this is important.
Holy shit!
The shark is eating the plane.
That needs to be on the end and the birds fly away.
Why is that not on the Wii?
Why is that not being optioned for a video game?
That was 50 kinds of awesome.
It's so awful.
You're only encouraging these people.
Video games are kind of stupid.
Loki, welcome.
I mean, I realize there are some video games out there with deep plots and all this stuff, but come on.
That just screams America.
Fuck yeah.
Sharks eating planes.
I just like this scene.
Dude looks out the window.
Shark!
I assure you that watching the two seconds of that aren't necessarily as good as watching a full 90-minute movie.
Imagine you're sitting down with a Nintendo Wii and then all of a sudden... Holy shit!
Why would a shark attack a plane?
It makes no sense.
Why do fighting characters decide to fight to the death and throw fireballs at each other and do spinning bird kicks and all the other bullshit?
Come on!
It's a video game.
Sharks can eat planes.
In fact, that should be in Street Fighter V.
Maybe it could be in Civilization 5.
That's right, there is a Civilization 5.
How'd you like that transition?
There is a Civilization 5 announced.
It is coming fall of 2010.
Of course, this made me squee.
You know I love my Civilization.
I think Civilization 1 is like my favorite PC game they've ever made.
But good old Sid Meier and Civilization series, a fifth installment coming out from 2K Games this fall, 2010.
And I shouldn't be surprised at this news, although I have to admit this was news I kind of wasn't expecting.
But then the news came out this week and I was like,
Fuck yeah, another Civilization!
Cool!
I wasn't expecting it, but cool.
Because the fourth one was actually really good.
It was probably my favorite next to the first one.
But they are talking about it's going to be an all-new engine.
The biggest change, the most shocking change, if you will.
They have switched to hexagon tiles instead of square-based tiles.
It's now going to be hexagon.
So think Catan meets Civilization, or Catanalization, if you will, is what I'm calling this game.
So there it is.
It's going to have, of course, the leaders will be all animated and the landscapes will be all nice and new combats, new diplomacy, and mods, mods, mods, because they are embracing of the mod community, which is very cool.
Don't expect this to come out on consoles, though.
It's just too much micromanaging in Civilization game.
It really can't be done on a console.
But, of course, there is Civ Revolution, which took some flack from Civ fans because it kind of dumbed down the series, if you will.
I'll tell you what, I think Civ Revolution is a great introduction to the series.
I think it was an overlooked game on consoles.
I think it was a lot of fun.
I don't think it compares to the PC versions, but I think if you're just not much of a PC gamer or want a game that is low-key on your console, go for it.
Civ Network's pretty cool.
Yeah, I'm looking forward to Civilization V. Gonna get your Civ on?
Oh yeah, I might have to actually put down WoW to try this out for a little while.
Alan, I know you play some PC games.
You play a pretty big mix of PC and console games, right?
Yep.
Do you play Civilization at all?
Not really.
I don't know if this is going to work.
No, but seriously though, you play a lot of shooter type games, right?
What kind of PC games are you into?
lots of first person shooters love Bioshock and Half-Life as far as Civ, a game like Civ I was really into Rise of Nations which was sort of a Civ clone that came out by Big Huge Games under Microsoft's Game Studios label so yeah, I played that very cool
Alright, before we get to the classic game of the week, I was sent another YouTube from SSJ100Matt in private.
I have to watch this.
This is the shark.
Yeah, eats the Golden Gate Bridge just like that.
During midday commute too.
How rude of that shark.
If that was in a video game?
I won't play as the fucking shark.
Exactly.
That's why Jaws didn't sell, Loki.
Can Jaws eat the Golden Gate Bridge?
No.
Can I do my bit, Rob?
I guess you can do your bit.
You've been very patient and suffering through an hour and a half of OLR tonight.
Actually, it's only an hour and 15 minutes, but we were here in the studio for quite a bit beforehand.
Classic Game of the Week, etc., etc., goes into the vault, finds a game, blah, blah, blah, picks one for you, and it's great.
Yeah?
Yes!
Our Game of the Week is Shenmue!
Yay!
Why, yes, I would like to try a game of Lucky Hit.
Um, all I found was, like, just the soundtrack stuff, because, really, I was getting tired of listening to Rio talk.
Asking about sailors.
I know, the sailors one, I was just, I had to go back and watch that.
Do you have sailors that come in here?
Well, sometimes they come in at night, but they leave before it gets too late.
The lady of most, yeah.
Anyway.
Shenmue is one of the masterpieces of Yu Suzuki.
It's really meant for interactive and to be a free-form sort of environment.
And, you know, you have real-life aspects like you go to bed, you get up in the morning, you pee.
Well, I don't know, they clearly don't show I'm peeing.
but you can also go to vending machines and arcades and you can like play classic games in the arcades which is awesome
and he has a video game system in his house, has convenience stores.
So it's really open as for what you could do.
But with the characters in there, basically the overall story is that Ryo comes home and finds them beating up his dad and then he gets smacked around and then his dad tells him where to find something that he's looking for and the game goes from there.
So...
You know, so you go around and you actually are trying to track down this guy and trying to figure out what's going on.
And you have to talk to all the people and you have to do rescues and you have to go against these other guys.
It's a big investigation, you know.
And you just play as this guy.
And you can also raise kittens.
You can feed kittens.
Oh, well, I'm sold.
They're cute little kittens.
But, um...
The game was... There were little quick time events that were in the game too where you would witness something and you would have to hit the right button at the right time and that's how a lot of the fighting went too and then it would go along with a cutscene and you had your little questing areas and you had your different battles and Ryo could fight because his dad ran a dojo and of course he was going to teach his kid.
The cool thing about this, though, is that it was supposed to be a killer app for the Saturn.
That was the big thing about it.
In fact, you can actually find online...
A video of the Saturn version.
It was pretty sweet for Saturn at the time.
But it was going to try to revive the Saturn.
But since the Dreamcast was coming out, they actually started working on Shenmue.
At the time it was Katana, remember?
That's right, I remember that, yeah.
Yeah.
And then what was being worked on was called Project Berkeley.
So there were tech demos out under that name.
And then it went into actual production for Dreamcast.
And every character that you run into in the game has... They had voice actors for.
In Japanese and English, a full orchestrated soundtrack.
And...
At that time, that level of voice acting was kind of unheard of too.
That was pretty awesome, I gotta say.
And then it had a weather system in the game called the Magic Weather System.
Um...
So when you go through the game, you have different, you know, things that are happening, but they actually were meant to reflect the actual weather conditions of Yokosuka at the time, which is where he lived in Japan.
And it was set in the 1986-1987.
So you can actually go and explore different parts of town, too.
Remember the 80s?
So this could have been happening concurrently with Karate Kid 2.
Yes.
Okay.
But I mean, you know, it's meant to be, you know, what Japan was like in the 80s in a little small town.
You know, in the Japanese version you had Coca-Cola stuff everywhere.
Which is funny, since Pepsi's, Pepsi Japan, their big thing was with, Sega's big thing was with Pepsi.
Remember they had Pepsi Man?
Yeah.
I remember in the Crazy Taxi games, you were going to all the Pepsi brand restaurants.
But they actually put out a couple of games in Japan that were Pepsi Man.
I remember that, yeah.
You could actually go on YouTube and look up little commercials of Pepsi Man.
So, anyway.
So I thought it was funny that they had Coca-Cola for that one everywhere.
And you know, and...
It was, you know, also with, they were trying to show exactly what, you know, people were like in that days, like the younger generation was going more towards a western look for things.
So you had your older generation in one style and your younger generation in a different style.
And you also had a passport disc that you could go in and view the cutscenes for the movies.
You could listen to the music.
You had information so you could learn about other things going on in the game and the characters.
You had the mini-games you could replay.
You had a free battle.
Just all kinds of interactive stuff.
And then you could use the passport to get to Shenmue World through the Dreamcast internet.
So it was just all kinds of... It had an online manual network ranking for all your things.
You could play with... You had VMU icons for your cute little VMU.
collectible items like the toy capsules which would be like ships from other games I had an OPA OPA your data review it was all kinds of stuff and you can also track everything that you've done in the game from how long you've played to how long you've done the mini games to how many soft drinks you've bought
and it of course discontinued when they cancelled Dreamcast production and there was a sequel of course which was Shenmue 2 but because it didn't sell very well Shenmue or Shenmue 2 we didn't get any more story that was it and there's people still holding their breath for Shenmue 3 and I have a feeling that we might see it one day but I like breathing
But, you know, they also did a figure that Dan showed me of Ryo driving a forklift.
There's also, he's in the Sega Racers game.
Yes, he is, and he's riding the motorbike, and he also rides the forklift.
But you can actually buy a figure, a recent figure that came out of Ryo riding a forklift.
Can I admit something?
Go for it.
I've never played this game.
I've heard about how fascinating it is I even had a Dreamcast but I just never really got around to playing this game Would you like to borrow my copy?
Would you like to play a game of Lucky Hit?
That's all I know There's some video where the dude just goes around asking everybody that and I kind of found it funny But I've always heard about its epic epicness You can play my copy if you want I don't even know if my Dreamcast is hooked up It's full of epic epicness like you just said
All right.
Shenmue, your classic game of the week.
So there it is.
All right.
We're going to take a break here at Orange Lounge Radio, but we've got plenty more to come tonight in Part B. We've got, of course, your phone calls and your Twitter topics if you haven't sent in any Twitter topics.
Go ahead and get those in right now to at OLR on Twitter.
We're going to get to the rapid fire news as well and then get to some other stories including kind of a surprising new iPhone game as well as some of the dates and things for the upcoming Xbox Live block party and some news on Fable 3.
We got all that coming up right after a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio.
And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday night, February the 21st of 2010.
You are listening to that podcast where every gamer has a voice.
And you might not know this, but we have an Olympic gold medal for being awesome.
So we're going to talk about some more gaming news, of course, tonight.
Join us if you're listening live at All Games Radio.
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to be.
as you are listening live on this Sunday if you've never listened live before you really should join us sometime it's kind of a different show when you're listening live and as Alan is finding out tonight it's a really different show when you're sitting here in studio
Yes.
No, that's alright.
Yeah, I'm good.
Cheers, thanks a lot.
Yes, there's a cool fan-made 8-bit-esque Mega Man first-person shooter game that someone's made called Mega Man 8-Bit Deathmatch and features some of the original Mega Man characters and their kind of 8-bit glory, kind of almost like a Doom mod, but I don't think it is.
and yeah it's really sweet you can actually check it out on I believe it's cutstuff.net is where you can find that to download and apparently it's free at least they have a trailer of it and stuff I'm not sure when it's actually being released but it's pretty cool
Yeah, anyways.
So other things that are pretty cool.
There's a lot of stuff out there that are allowing you to buy a game and get something else for free.
For example, last week we talked about how if you were one of the people that bought Darksiders, you would get a code for a free Red Faction game.
Well, if you didn't happen to keep your mystery code with your copy of Darksiders, fear not.
You can still redeem...
A free copy of Red Faction Guerrilla, assuming that you have a copy of your receipt and some other stuff that they want you to send them copies of.
And with that, you'll get a free copy of Red Faction Guerrilla and a digital art book.
Also, another kind of bonus THQ is handing out.
With people that pre-ordered Dawn of War 2, the expansion to the Warhammer franchise...
you will be able to get Saints Row 2 on PC for free which is pretty cool and then of course THQ isn't the only ones doing that for Battlefield Bad Company 2 on PC if you happen to pre-order your copy through the EA store you will net yourself a free copy of Battlefield 2142 as well
and then finally if you happen not to play PC games and maybe bought a PSP Go during the last few weeks here you'll be able to redeem I guess a free copy of Assassin's Creed Bloodlines or LittleBigPlanet for PSP and to do this you have to redeem it between February 18th and March 21st
Wait, so that's like if you just buy a new PSP Go, you can get one of those games for free?
Yeah, during this time.
I guess they're trying to finally make it worth some of the money they're asking for it.
Yeah, so that's kind of cool.
And then finally, there was a contest that was being held for modders for Unreal Tournament 3.
And Epic has released the winners of the Make Something Unreal contest.
and several mod teams created a bunch of different mods for it.
The winning mod was a game called The Hunted.
It was a third-person survivor horror action game that kind of looked like a Wild West version of Left 4 Dead.
As the winner of the contest, the team will receive $50,000 and a commercial license for the Unreal Engine, meaning the team can actually make an Unreal Engine title as a commercial product.
And...
That'd be pretty awesome looking.
I watched the trailer for this and it was sweet.
Some of the other winners.
Second place was The Ball from Toltec Studios.
Third place, Angels Fall First by PlantStorm.
And it's the PlantStorm team.
They won $30,000.
Fourth place, Prometheus.
And also the Prometheus team, they won $20,000.
And it looks like fifth place won $10,000 with Hazard, A Journey of Life.
And they had some other categories as well.
Lots of money being given away, though.
That's pretty cool.
So, yeah.
Hopefully, we'll look forward to seeing that.
Alright, well I have some quick topics for you guys here.
And one of them has to do with a game that's unlikely to...
It's not one you would think is as played as it is, but what does WoW have?
World of Warcraft's got, what, 11, maybe 12 million players on it?
I think that's about right.
I think Warcraft is probably one of the biggest MMOs with that many people.
What if I told you there was a game with about seven times as many players on it playing right now?
It's FarmVille.
Yeah, that's right.
There's a news story circulating game blogs this week.
I hate that game.
FarmVille has passed 80 million users yesterday.
DarkSakura.com
Yeah, so FarmVille, of course, 80 million people playing FarmVille.
Look, whether you love or hate FarmVille, it certainly goes to show that Facebook as a gaming platform should not be discounted.
I mean, that is a huge amount of people.
No word as to how many spam messages those 80 million people have sent their friends about.
I don't know, sign up for this and get a million farm bucks or whatever it is.
I don't know.
So I can get a super cow to make lots of milk or whatever they do.
Super cow.
Super cow, whatever.
I see all this bullshit all the time.
I get all these group invites like, join me now in Farmville so I can get my honeycomb or whatever.
I hit all of those.
Oh my gosh.
No, I get like group invites to my email.
I mean, ugh.
I just report them for abuse every time.
I just get irritated.
But see, yeah, I mean, Actdeft in chatroom brings up a good point.
Bejeweled Blitz greater than Farmville.
I will admit, I still play Bejeweled Blitz, like, a lot.
Like, Alan, you watched me play the other day.
Like, I was like, oh, I gotta get my score in for the week because I want to get entered in for laptop.
And, yeah, I have Bejeweled Blitz on my phone.
Not more, I quit that too I've tried some of them
and I tried FarmVille and I finally actually told people before they had the hide, you know, all things from this application to just stop including me on their little announcements.
You know, I would hunt down people and tell them, disinclude me.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Of course, my favorite of those groups is still I Bet This Pickle Can Get More Fans Than Nickelback.
Wasn't there one that's like I Bet This Mobius Strip Can Get More Fans Than Itself?
I saw a group called that.
Or there was another one.
I don't know.
There was one you joined this week.
Or was that just a status update, Alan?
You put like I Bet That X Can Get More Fans Than Y. I don't remember what it said.
I Bet This Atvar Can Get More Fans Than Y.
Pound Fu, like just variables.
Programming joke?
Yes.
Got it.
That's a very high-level nerd joke.
That might be too highbrow for this show, actually.
You need to tone it down with some dick and fart jokes.
Oh, hey, StarCraft II, hey, no better way to bring it to gaming than talk about StarCraft II.
Of course, as I'm sure you've heard many other places, the beta launched this week, and yeah, lots of people very eager to get in this game.
How eager are they?
So eager that they are paying up to $300 for StarCraft 2 beta keys to get into this game.
This is some of the tickets that were handed out at BlizzCon 2008, apparently.
Now they are selling for $300.
As high as $450 they've been spotted.
Wow.
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I think StarCraft 2 is going to be kind of cool, but not $450 cool.
Dude, I can wait like a month for the finished product.
Or not a month.
Three months for the finished product.
I'll wait six even.
A lot of good news at Blizzard Camp right now, though.
Blizzard also this week has announced that their Pandaren campaign, that's right, they were selling in-game pets in World of Warcraft for $10 to fundraise money for the Make-A-Wish Foundation.
Yeah, I bought one.
Shut up.
Don't judge me.
Hey, I helped contribute to a cause that overall raised, they are announcing...
1.1 million dollars was raised by the Pandaren monks.
And that was such a big donation.
It was actually reported in the OC Register, which is a pretty big newspaper in Orange County, which you may know or not know.
That's where Blizzard is headquartered.
What you also may not know about Orange County, I believe there is an art gallery there called the Orange Lounge.
If you Google Orange Lounge, I don't know if you put Orange Lounge right here, just like Orange Lounge, you get that in your results.
Just kind of a LOL what type of moment.
Anyhow, the Pandora Monks are still on sale, but you should know they are no longer going towards the Make-A-Wish Foundation.
That was just a limited time thing.
Hey, if you look up Dark Sakura on Google, you can get my DeviantArt page.
Do you really?
Yeah, you do.
Interesting.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Yes, I do.
And by the way, I found the Orange Lounge.
Nice.
So anyway, yeah, with the stuff I have, we've got rock band releases coming from Hymn, One Night Only, The Police, and Marilyn Manson.
So the Hymn Pack is Heart Killer, Ode to Solitude, Wings of a Butterfly, which I don't give a shit about.
And then we have...
KSM, Distracted, Marilyn Manson, The Dope Show, One Night Only, Just for Tonight, and Please, Walking on the Moon.
And they're also available for Lego Rock Band.
Then we have...
Yeah, David Coverdale's kind of funny.
He's not sure if there's going to be any Whitesnake songs coming on to any of the music games.
The only one that I care about is Here I Go Again.
Because, I mean, I'm sorry, that song's just awesome.
And then Axis is bringing back the Kunio-kun series.
We...
River City Dodgeball
Yep, Super Dodgeball Brawlers.
Sweet.
So that's it.
Alright.
Let's get into some Twitter topics, folks.
We always invite your Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR and we're going to read some of your tweets.
Show us your tweets.
DarkSakura.com
for parts of like West Sacramento-ish.
I think they're really popular, but not a lot here.
And U-verse, I don't think really exists here.
Yeah, we don't have U-verse.
I looked up all of those for my new apartment because I wanted to competitively price and see who could give me the best deal, but Comcast was my only option.
But it looks like the internet's running fine now, so whatever.
Let's see.
Got a message from Alpha Cananogram that's pointing us to this news story on Joystick.
I want to make sure this isn't coming up later in the show because I didn't familiarize myself very well with the show world tonight.
Uh-oh.
Yeah, the personal reason is I gotta get off this sinking ship quick.
Hopefully things are able to turn around there.
And also another tweet to us from Actdeft saying, can someone buy me this please?
And he links us to a story on Kotaku that talks about pre-ordering the Final Fantasy XIII soundtrack.
85 tracks on 4 CDs.
You can also get that on the North American Squeenix store.
I'm sure it's going to be available through iTunes as well, but what a nice little collector's edition that would make.
So, there you go.
Nice.
I don't know, I haven't really heard a lot of the music from Final Fantasy XIII yet.
Just the Leona Lewis song, but that's because that's on her CD.
Anyway, so you can hear the little clip on iTunes.
So I haven't really heard the actual music music from the game yet.
But I did see...
of all places i saw on oh no they didn't this week which if you've never heard of oh no they didn't alan help me describe oh no they didn't you've been a member longer than i have how would you describe it it's the largest community on live journal it's so it's so large that during um major news events it'll actually crash the site for one community that's totally non-profit they don't make any um money off of it but it's just celebrity gossip and media news so it's just you know celeb lols basically yeah
And lots of great... Animated GIFs are the whole reason to be on Oh No They Didn't.
You find the best animated GIFs you're going to find anywhere on the internet there.
So anyway, Oh No They Didn't had a story about... Somebody posted the actual video on YouTube of Leona Lewis playing Final Fantasy XIII.
And it was kind of awkward to look at.
Like, you know, she's really cute and everything, but her lines sounded really fed.
Let me see if I can find that video really quick before we get to the next news story here.
Maybe I'll have Loki do a news story real quick while I try to find the video, and then I'll come back to this, because you've got to hear this, because I don't know.
As precious as Leona Lewis is, I can't really think of a good adjective to describe Leona Lewis, but precious seems to be one.
Her lines sound really forced, so I've got to try this.
By the way, AkumaJP in chat is saying, quite good.
Apparently the music is quite good.
So, chat.orangezonsradio.com
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
A week after that, March 10th, we'll have Scrap Metal, which is kind of a top-down racing game.
No one will really care, though, because that's the same week as, I believe, Final Fantasy XIII.
And that's also 1,200 Microsoft points, or $15.
March 17th, there will be the Perfect Dark Xbox Live Arcade game coming out for $10, or 800 Microsoft points.
And then finally, of course, as expected, on March 24th, the Game Room Hub will be available for no charge.
Of course, the games will run on their 400 Microsoft points or $5 for a PC and Xbox 360 friendly version.
Or if you want to license them for one system, 240 Microsoft points or 40 Microsoft points for a single play.
I'm so excited about Game Room, though.
I think it's going to be fun.
And I hope there'll be people that want to have competitions on the old school games with me.
I'll buy some of them, but I'm definitely not buying all the games that I had.
Oh, definitely.
No.
And I refuse.
I will not buy a game that was already out on Xbox Live.
Although, I will ask this, because I don't see a story on this anywhere else.
And I read this earlier this week.
Did you hear about how apparently some of the Midway games have disappeared from Xbox Live completely?
Yes.
Joust, and Smash TV.
Pretty much anything that was connected to Midway.
Gauntlet, they're gone.
They're not on Xbox Live.
You cannot buy them now.
Now, they swear up and down, or at least on Major Nelson's blog, it swears nothing to do with Game Room, it's a licensing thing, and maybe that has to do with the Warner Brothers acquisition, but I don't know.
I kind of look at that and go, okay, uh-huh, sure.
I think it has to do with Midway being gone.
I think that's what it is, because now... But seriously, if Joust shows up on Game Room, aren't you going to be like...
I'm sorry, I gave a visual.
They're not going to be... I don't think that's the reason why.
First off, I can't imagine those games are really popular right now as far as purchases go.
But they're classic.
Smash TV is a classic.
I understand that, but at the same time...
I guess maybe they could be doing that, but I don't think it's going to matter because there's going to be Pac-Man and Namco games aren't going away on Xbox Live Arcade.
Konami games, I know.
Konami games.
Frogger.
We'll always have Frogger.
So I don't... Yeah, great.
So I don't doubt that... I don't think that's the reason why is that because they're putting them on that service, but we'll see.
And a good question from Actdeft in our chatroom, Joust, then what will happen with those Xbox Live 12-month game codes?
I guess they're screwed, or maybe you'll get the points instead.
Well, first off, so you know, the Xbox Live 12-month game codes that come with free games and stuff, I think they switched out those games.
Yeah, they probably switched out Joust a long time ago.
They do new versions all the time.
And the same thing, you know, they may be off the marketplace, but those codes may still redeem it.
and if you've already downloaded it and need to re-download it again, they're still up there.
So they're on their servers.
Yeah, and your game doesn't stop working just because it's gone.
Yeah, so it may not matter that those game codes are in there.
Do you know how many of those freaking games I bought?
Like I think what I want to do tomorrow is just go in when I have the internet again.
I'm going to go in and actually just play Joust and Smash TV and all those games you can't get anymore just to fill up my gamer card to go, I have them.
Alright, let's go back to something I was mentioning earlier.
This video is only a minute 13, so I'm going to go ahead and play it in studio.
This is Leona Lewis talking about Final Fantasy XIII, and this is on YouTube user Gamerspawn, although I'm guessing he probably just stole it from the official Squeenix YouTube, but this is just who I'm playing it from, so whatever.
So here it is, Leona Lewis talking about Final Fantasy XIII.
There's a little, here we go.
Really amazing.
Graphics are insane.
She just did this little, like, yes thing with her little hand, like a little fist.
Like, I don't know how many times I've been playing Final Fantasy where I went, yes, but that couldn't have looked any more forced.
I just point out.
I have to say, I have, though, thrown down my controller and gone, oh, for fuck's sake.
Exactly.
That's what I want to see Leona Lewis do.
I want to see her throw her controller out the window like, fucking monster.
That would be funny.
What do you want to bet?
Like, she might be holding the controller, but somebody else off camera is holding the real controller and playing the game.
So they can show her playing the game, quote, quote.
Amazing.
I just wanted to, like, run around the land all day.
Hi, everyone.
I'm thrilled to be collaborating with Square Enix on such a groundbreaking game.
I never would have imagined my hands as such a perfect fit for Final Fantasy XIII, but the strong female protagonist struck a chord with me, and I can't wait to see Lightning do her thing.
In anticipation of the much-awaited launch of Final Fantasy XIII, and on behalf of Square Enix, please join us in celebration of the launch of Final Fantasy XIII on March 9th.
It's like I can see her eyes reading off the cue card.
I mean, no one says protagonist, you know.
I wanna run around the field!
I see something sparkly!
In defense of that... Ah, Butterfly!
Oh my god!
In defense of the running around all day thing, I have been doing a lot of that in Star Trek Online just to see, oh, I wonder if this planet's here.
Oh, I wonder if this planet's here.
But that's an MMO.
The funny thing is, Final Fantasy XIII's kind of been getting a little slack for how linear it is.
I've heard it's kind of like, you don't have towns and the dungeons are not... It's a little more linear, although I've heard good things about the game.
It's just a little different.
It's just funny to hear her say, I could just run around all day.
Do that.
I can just run around all day because that's all I know how to do.
I can run around all day long and annoy the fuck out of my significant other who's watching me play this game and go, What the fuck are you doing, woman? !
I was gonna say it's the only way really one of her singles is gonna sell 2 million copies here is that she attaches it to that video game well no because then all the stuck up people are gonna be like oh well the Japanese version's better cause you know everything you know who actually had I think to this date had the best Final Fantasy song ever and that's Angela Aki I'm sorry that hers was such a crap game but Kiss Me Goodbye was a great song and
and it launched her career.
That was 9, right?
Yes.
But I don't think 9 was a crap game.
It was one of the better PlayStation.
It was better than 8.
The thing about 9 is it just kind of like, if I remember right, you know, this is many years ago, but if I remember right, 9 just kind of showed up, like, just out of nowhere, like, hey, Final Fantasy 9's out.
Like, oh, wow.
And then it was like, hey, fanservice, fanservice, and then, hey, the PS2's out now.
Like, it was kind of the same thing that happened with Final Fantasy 12.
It was like, hey, here's Final Fantasy 12 finally.
Oh, but the Xbox 360 and PS3 are out now.
Darn.
Well, I meant, and I'm not saying it was a bad game, I'm not saying, a crap game was more like, I lost interest in it.
Like, I got to the, I got on the airship and I was done.
You know, when you first escape.
But, it had the best song.
SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom saying looking at the video she is using the player one controller.
Yeah, but see if they're smart.
If they're really smart they have another system that it's synced to and then they have the other controller synced to the other one.
Yeah.
They thought ahead, huh?
Oh, come on.
That's how I would do it.
An idiot could play a Final Fantasy game.
And after all, she did say that she liked running around the field, so maybe they just put her down.
Well, she was just running around the field.
Okay, look, I like Leona Lewis.
She's precious.
Why are these animals attacking me while I'm running around the field?
Why are we picking on Leona Lewis?
She's defenseless.
It's like we're kicking Bambi, like making fun of Leona Lewis.
We're not making fun of Leona Lewis, we're making fun of how forced that video was.
I don't mind the Final Fantasy XIII song.
I think the trailer is kind of weird with all the stuff blowing up and it's like, My hands!
You know, like explosions and motorcycles.
My hands!
You know, it's like, it doesn't really fit.
I can put that song then as my battle music in Final Fantasy XIV.
There you go.
When you're attacking a level 75 bunny.
Crushing your neck.
My hands.
Ripping your head off.
I don't like doing falsetto on the show.
Hey, let's talk about iTunes and the iPhone.
Because, of course, the iPhone, whether Loki likes it or not, is another gaming platform.
And apparently...
What?
Never mind.
Oh, okay.
Apparently there's this game out on the iPhone that folks are getting a little crazy about.
And it's Wobble Eyeboobs.
This program got... Use your imagination, folks.
$30,000 is how much this game made last year.
But it was now being removed because people were complaining about the sexual content.
Apparently...
Some of the rules that were given as to what is not supposed to be in your app.
No images of women in bikinis.
No images of men in bikinis.
No skin.
No silhouettes that indicate that wobble can be used for wobbling boobs.
No sexual connotations or innuendo.
Boobs, babes, booty, sex.
Nothing that can be sexually arousing.
And no apps will be approved that in any way imply sexual content.
By the way, the guy asked, since no skin is cited as the reason this app was pulled, he asked if a burqa was okay.
But the Apple guy apparently got angry at that.
I don't know.
Do you think Apple has a right to be removing these ads?
It's gone.
Huh?
It's gone.
Oh yeah, it's gone.
Do you think Apple has a right to be taking this stuff down?
I think they have a right, but I think at the same time they should offer this kind of content.
I mean, just maybe locked somehow.
We can download a song called Boobs.
And aren't there apps about farting and peeing and pooping and all this stuff?
That's not nudity.
I'm sure there's apps about blowing people up.
Well, unless you're gonna go in your pants, pooping does involve nudity at some point.
You can rip people's eyes out, but goddammit, if a boob shakes...
It's over for you.
So for example, in a game like God of War that has lots of bloody violence, there should be some really erotic game that they put out with no violence in it.
It's only fair.
Just make it prove that you're 18 in order to download the content.
Doesn't it kind of already do that?
I seem to remember downloading some content and it'll say, this might be objectionable.
I think the keyboard cat app that I have, which will play keyboard cat at the touch of a button, it's amazing.
actually says this might contain mature content and you have to be 17 or older to continue.
It's keyboard cat.
I know, but... I think that cats playing keyboard is offensive.
It's cruelty to keyboards.
What about dogs playing keyboards?
I don't give a shit.
Just curious.
They should play the bassoon.
What?
I just said the bassoon for some reason.
I don't know.
Where did the bassoon come from?
I think I mentioned the bassoon quartet earlier.
You're in a bassoon mood.
I see.
Rolf the dog played keyboard before anyone.
Sorry.
Freaking keyboard cat app.
Now I have to download it.
I've got to bring it back to Muppets.
Rolf the dog is before keyboard cat.
Can I do a story?
Yes.
Speaking of iPhone and violence, um, yeah, Street Fighter 4 is going to be coming on the iPhone, and I'm like, why?
Really?
Why?
So far, all we see is Ken and Ryu, um, nothing really in action.
They look kind of, um, dinky and tiny.
I wasn't aware that the iPhone had a big 3D processor in it or anything.
So...
Whatever.
But, in happier news for those of us who will play Super Street Fighter 4, we get some Street Fighter 3 characters.
We get Ibuki, we get Makoto, and we get Dudley, as we mentioned in rumor of the week before.
So, that's pretty cool.
And there's also this cake box.
I was looking at the Japanese... I'm sure you saw what my wallpaper was of Sakura, but it was the Super Street Fighter 4 website.
There's also this Korean taekwondo fighter who's just vicious.
Absolutely vicious.
They show this character beating up Sagat, and they never show anyone beating up Sagat.
So, pretty crazy.
I didn't play a lot of Street Fighter 3, admittedly.
Are these good characters to be bringing over?
Ibuki was my staple for Street Fighter 3.
Same.
She's fast.
Although, you know who I actually would have really liked to have seen was Elena.
I think Elena was the one I used.
She's the one that kind of did like capoeira type moves, right?
Yeah.
I used her when I played.
She was all leg.
Ah, very cool.
Kind of like Eddie in Tekken 4, right?
Or 3, 4, one of the two?
3.
Ah.
Because after that they got Christy.
So Street Fighter 4 on the iPhone, huh?
They're talking about pouring it to the PSP also.
I can see the PSP better than I can see the buttons.
Well, the screen capture, this image that they had of it was like the joystick and everything was on the screen.
So are you going to actually be able to see what you're doing?
No.
It's a bad idea.
They're going to make money off of it, but it's a bad idea.
Well, you know what I think about Street Fighter 4 coming to the iPhone?
Your mom?
Actually, no, that's the Muppet Babies theme.
I just had it stuck in my head ever since Alan mentioned Rolf.
Let's jam to this a little bit.
Because it's going to be better than Street Fighter 4 on the iPhone, let's face it.
Oh yeah, no, I don't care about Street Fighter 4 on the iPhone.
It's going to control like shit.
Until Apple releases an actual joystick for the iPhone, who cares?
But I would download a Muppet Babies app.
I would.
Well, maybe you might be more interested in Fable 3.
Fable 3, they're talking a little bit about the co-op in the game.
And it sounds to me, even though they're claiming it's all new and stuff,
It sounds just like Fable 2 if you ask me, but according to an interview with Peter Molino during the 4Guys1UP podcast, they talked about the co-op system.
Basically, if you go into someone else's game, you'll take your player, your player's dog,
The weapons that you've crafted as well.
All the unique stuff that you've made will be in the game.
Also, if you don't want to be tied into the person's camera, you could go off and do your own thing.
But of course, just like the second game, you want to be careful of who you invite in your game because someone may come in and rape all your women.
Just like, you know... I hate it when that happens.
Yes, exactly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
or hits on the shopkeeper and then they stop working.
I hate it when I leave my house and I come back and all the women got raped while I was gone.
What a downer to your day.
Yes.
So...
Fable 2 and Fable 3 probably not that much different from each other.
What a shock.
Despite all this hype, you know, much like the hype from Fable 1 to Fable 2, don't be surprised if they're very similar.
Well, if I get to bring all this stuff into the game, can I bring Shermie into my game?
That's what I want to do.
What would she do?
Poop?
Not be able to run and catch up.
No, she'd find a towel that was laying around in your game and piss on it.
Which is what she's been doing lately.
Fuck you to my cat.
No. 120.
Yeah, 90 minutes for the average player.
Apparently it's the entire first dungeon of the game and two bosses from the game.
So that's coming out on February 25th for the game Darksiders.
I guess they just wanted to see, wanted to really give you a whole in-depth look at the game.
It seems like, why not?
If a game is going to take 50 hours to complete, what's with giving away an hour and a half for free?
They could have given away an hour and a half demo for Oblivion and people would still buy it.
I think that's a good idea.
Get people hooked.
Games like Saints Row where they had a half an hour demo.
I played that demo like 80 times.
It was awesome.
Get people hooked and then there you go.
Kill time until the game came out.
DarkSakura is going to dive into the mailbag.
at Mailbag at OrangeLauncher.com and read some emails right now.
about the general gaming populace.
They have no fucking clue what the average gamer wants.
This guy needs to shut his mouth and also the iPad is a disgrace and I wish it would be the downfall of Apple Go Microsoft.
Um, whatever.
Now this is a little... Can I respond to that real quick?
Like, dude, you're welcome to your opinion and all that fun stuff.
But you're wrong.
But, like, okay, even if the iPad fails, Apple still has ginormous business as a phone company.
I know that's not what they started as.
They started with those little green monitors that were in all of our grade school classrooms.
but they're a huge phone company now and yet computers and all that stuff too but the phone thing is huge.
The Mac is still the standard of the graphic design industry.
But yeah, I do remember Loki going off on that one show that was kind of funny and yeah, he had a point.
I'll meet you halfway there.
Now for the long ass email of the night.
Yay!
Hi, LLR.
I'm not sure how much help this email will be, but I was listening to your last two podcasts and wanted to know what it would take to get the video game development companies to be unionized.
I'm definitely no expert, but I work for a local in Chicago.
Although I have no say in the local's decisions or anything, I've been with them for a while now, and I've seen how things are done.
I also work closely with one of the largest unions in the U.S.
I'm not an employee.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
AFSCME, AFL-CIO, and SCIU are one of the biggest unions, SCIU dealing with USA, Canada, and Puerto Rico.
One of the ladies at work said that the video game industry would probably fall under the entertainment category, which would mean that all of the unions that AFL-CIO is the one to contact.
What they need to do is contact their closest AFL-CIO branch.
It all depends, although, because I don't know which video game company you had in mind.
If you were thinking EA, where a friend of mine works, they would need to contact the Sacramento office or maybe San Francisco.
I honestly can't remember.
I didn't take notes.
And there's a link.
It's actually aflcio.org slash joinayunion slash how slash howto.cfm
Now you can end my email here, but I'd like to voice my opinion on this.
Unionizing video game workers is probably supported by most gamers who feel they should have fair work hours, pay, and everything else.
However, say there's a strike at Square Enix and it prevented the release of the newest Final Fantasy game or strike at Capcom that's keeping the newest crossover fighting game from coming out.
Will gamers still support the striking workers?
Who will gamers choose the product to the workers?
I honestly don't know what I'd want more to be honest.
Remember the writer's strike that prevented new episodes of TV shows from premiering?
Were you reading for the writers or were you craving more episodes of Lost or Ugly Betty?
This is my insertment.
I didn't care.
I don't really watch TV.
I know you don't watch a lot of TV, but look, from the standpoint of somebody who was like, I think the writer's strike kind of ruined Heroes.
Well, the second season was already kind of poopy, but I don't know.
The writer's strike really damned some shows that were on a roll.
I see the point the email is trying to make.
It's a great point and one I didn't consider last week.
That's why I'm glad we got emails on it.
But if companies also want to keep their product going, they need to have a quality work environment for the people that are working for them.
You have to respect the worker.
To continue, I remember in high school after I graduated that teachers were striking for whatever reason, maybe pay, and they kept school from starting on time, which meant the end of the school year was that much later.
The students were not happy and wanted the striking to end, not for the teacher's sake, but for their early release.
Who knows?
I probably didn't want to be on the teacher's side because teachers aren't usually students' best friend.
Who knows?
So yeah, I wouldn't know what I'd go for.
If you support the workers, then be really sure you still support them, even at the cost of the release date of a game you're really looking forward to.
Stan.
Rob, it was nice meeting you when you came to ASEN.
I know I was kind of boring.
Oh, okay, okay.
I know who this is.
Well, that was a great email and brought up some points.
And I don't know if you had told me you worked for a union, but that's really neat to kind of see that side of it and kind of brought up some things I didn't think about.
Like, especially, yeah, what would happen if they go on strike?
You know, we hear all these reports about conditions.
And again, I want to make this clear.
I wasn't necessarily, like, supporting saying they should unionize.
I was just kind of asking the question, what about?
Like, is it a feasible option?
Question mark.
I don't know.
You know?
The only way anything's going to change is if something is done.
So I was just suggesting maybe Union is that something, maybe.
And it's kind of neat to get that email and think about that perspective.
If that were to happen, strikes would be a very real possibility.
And people already bitch and complain when games are delayed, even if the game is being delayed for quality reasons.
Yeah, a lot of people have been...
I don't know, I would like to think me personally
I'm okay with the game being delayed as long as they're going to put out a quality product at the end like I was really looking forward to Blur that was supposed to come out fourth quarter last year but they delayed it to this year because they wanted to make sure online wasn't fucked and I'm okay with that I would rather they fix it than put out a crap game oh I agree I agree with that
There actually is one more email about the unions.
Hey OLR, I know we've been on this topic for three weeks now, so I will keep it short.
The problem with unionizing game developers is that unions cost extra money that game publishers are just not going to be willing to pay for.
They'll just hire non-unionized employees.
Lord knows that there are enough people desperate to get into the industry by any means possible that they will work god-awful hours thinking they're the next best game developer since Miyamoto.
Basically, as long as there are people to take advantage of, this will probably never stop.
Unfortunately, it doesn't leave much room for people with families who don't want to or simply can't work 12-hour days seven days a week.
These people get suckered in by company lies when they say they're getting hired for the job, saying that crunch periods will only happen on a necessity basis.
The crunch period slowly becomes perpetual, and if they don't crunch, they get fired.
etc.
etc.
etc.
etc.
Hopefully I kept that brief enough.
As a programmer myself, I count my blessings for being employed by a company that lets us go home at 7pm, though plenty of us stay later willingly, and doesn't make us work weekends, and I think it's outrageous that there are situations like this right in my backyard since I work in Silicon Valley.
Yours truly, AZHP
Well, I wish we could name – I completely understand why you don't want to say who you work for on a delicate subject like this, so please.
But I wish we could recognize whatever company that is and go, yay, and pat them on the back for having kind of a good employee policy like that.
Maybe that's what it's going to take is negative press for these companies like EA and whatever else we've heard about with the nightmare hours to curb it.
Bad press is never really a good thing.
I don't know.
It's not an easy issue.
I think this second emailer makes a really good point about the whole...
You get to test Barbie soccer!
I'll look at it, because I like reality TV, and I like video games, and I like House Sparks.
So you would think I'm all about something like the tester, but I know I'm not going to like it.
I just know it.
But something like that kind of glamorizes what might not actually be that glamorous.
It's just a little hard watching a show that's basically a commercial shoved down your throat.
Did you watch it?
No, but I can guess what it's gonna be.
A giant commercial shoved down my throat.
Oh, look it!
Let's test God of War 3!
Oh my goodness, it's so epic and wonderful.
But look at all these bugs!
No, it's not gonna be like that.
All it's gonna be is them stupid challenges that are game-related...
and then they get to talk about how awesome it was to get to play God of War 3 before anybody else you know what would make me watch the tester is if RuPaul was the judge you know and that at the end of every episode remember don't fuck it up it's time for you to lip sync for your life seriously if you've never watched Drag Race it's like the best reality show on right now well can I read the last email?
of course
Dear OLR, I have a pair of questions for Loki.
If I buy a banned modded 360 console and play a game with a patch, can I download the patch and will the patch prevent me from playing a burned game?
I wholly understand if you refuse to answer this question.
Stay care, Redertainment.
Repeat that.
A banned modded 360.
Okay.
And has a game that a patch is released for it.
Can you download the patch and will the patch prevent you from playing the burned game?
No, the patch will not prevent you from playing the Burned game, but you're not going to be able to connect to live to download the patch.
So you would have to download the patch by some other means and then transfer it to your hard drive.
And then, yes, you would be able to do that.
It's over!
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us emails.
I think that's the way DarkSakura should end the mailbag every week.
It's over!
There is actually a website, though, that does carry all of the game patches that are out there for Xbox 360.
And you can download them all individually and search by title.
Unfortunately, I do not remember what that website is.
But I know that if you do a search on Google, you'll probably be able to find it.
Because I've seen it a few times.
But that would be the way to do it if you're going to bother patching the game.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Yay!
Naughty Games!
Bubble Bath Babes 2?
Not quite.
This is actually... Miss World Nude 2010?
This doesn't even really have a game involved with it.
I mean, they're just... It's basically, if Ubisoft were to release this today, it would be probably called My Masturbation Coach.
Press A, C, Tits?
Is that the name of the game?
No, it's basically a game that tracks your masturbation and whatnot.
Wait, is this like instead of like MyFitnessCoach or WeFit?
Exactly.
It tracks your... Masturbation.
For example...
Do you have to enter it in manually?
Funny.
Anyways, the game is from the game developer Waffle, which they win right there because their name is Waffle.
I can't compete with that.
The Eero title looks... Let me butcher this real quick here.
It looks like Migeti Ga Toma Ranai Boku 2
Oh, I'm not even going to bother.
Are we talking like a Belgian waffle or like an Eggo?
It's just waffle.
Waffle, waffle, waffle.
Anyways.
That's going to be in a song someday.
I know that.
That's the code name of the game right there.
Waffle, waffle.
Anyways, so the game records important events or everyday events.
For example, today's play style, Socks Masturbation.
Yes, they give you inspirational...
methods of masturbation.
For example, number of times you've wanked today.
Total number of times wanked so far.
There is a graphical chart that has it all.
Time taken for ejaculation and average time taken for ejaculating.
Is it animation with little dead sperm?
They've got cute anime girls that are in there.
But it gets better.
And then of course they have a wonderful database where you can organize and track information.
Total time spent wanking so far.
Total number of ejaculations so far.
And then, of course, oh, this is even better.
And then they list innovative methods of masturbation you might have never thought about.
including, in the diagram here, it looks like that stuff cut out of foam and then someone has foam pieces in the tube.
I don't know.
Anyways, but then, of course, the game is sold with a pocket pussy as well.
I thought you just used the Wii Fitness board.
The Tenga...
The Tenga Egg Wavy is what it's called.
I thought that's what the resistance strap was for.
Ripped for your pleasure.
The cover, I mean, it's just topless anime chicks all wet and thriving around.
There is no way you would not know what this game is about.
Waffle!
Waffle!
You can do this!
So you should be able to do the same thing here and show total lost productivity time to masturbation in the world.
I would imagine that the pedometer could probably be used in slimmer fashion for this device.
Not going to see this on DSiWare, unfortunately.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I'm watching it.
And it's funny.
It's basically because Travis in the game, the way he saves is by taking a dump in a toilet.
And that's the animation that they show.
Well, this chick that's in the game, she's actually taking a shower.
Well, the glitch is that somehow she ends up in the middle... Ew, she goes in the shower?
No, she does not take a dump in the shower.
Shinobu...
I'll give you a moment.
Well, she's fake naked.
Yeah, it's Sims naked type of stuff.
But still, the thing is that she does not have clothes on and they cannot patch that out.
Go Nintendo.
No word on how exactly to recreate the glitch, but it is on YouTube for those who want to check it out.
Rob is having a real life segfault right now.
It's pretty amazing.
I'm gonna go drop a save
and SSJ100 Matt threw out the requisite tub girl question mark in our chat.
No, it's not tub girl.
Meh.
All right.
Oh, my stomach hurts.
Please.
Yeah, we need to do the FUs of the week now because I hurt from laughing.
F you to a bunch of little tiny minor things adding up to put me in the single worst mood I have ever been in in ages.
Rob, breathe.
Breathe.
I'm trying.
I don't know why it's so funny.
Okay, I'm okay.
I'm okay.
and DarkSakura.com
See?
Aww.
Ew, you can kind of see that.
Yeah, I'm going to take a picture of it and put it up online.
Because I'm that kind of exhibitionist.
Who wants to see my big bump?
Careful Waffle Entertainment might put that in their next game.
Loki.
I hate coughing.
It's tough.
I don't know.
I'm not super angsty.
F you to that not funny image that made me not stop laughing.
FU to just moves taking me like three weeks to accomplish moving.
Although everything was really smooth with the big furniture today, I still have so much stuff to clean.
So FU to cleaning.
Grr.
Alan, do you have any FUs of the week you'd like to share with our audience?
FU to having to job search for Super Serious rather than just casually having to find another job.
Do you want to try sharing some of your talents in case anyone's looking to hire somebody?
You can always get a job as a video game tester.
Oh, yeah.
Yes, he's breathing.
I think he qualifies.
So, all right.
Let's go ahead and let me do another story for you guys here from one more story.
And then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
But we do have one more story, and it's about a new video game movie in the works.
And that movie...
Missile Command.
Yes, that's right.
Missile Command apparently is being made into a movie.
At least, well, I don't know.
A lot of things they say are going to get made into a movie but don't really, but this is the latest one.
It's got more of a plot than Monopoly, the movie.
And Clue and all this stuff, right, they were talking about previously?
They should not remake Clue.
Clue was awesome the first time.
Well apparently it's coming from the Los Angeles Times that Atari is trying to sell a Missile Command film to a movie production company to get the Missile Command movie made.
I don't know what it would be about, but whatever.
It's got to be better than Armageddon was.
No word if Yars' Revenge might become a movie.
Who knows?
What kind of movie would you make out of Missile Command?
No word either if Mr. Awesome is going to be in the movie or not.
What's that?
A crappy one?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Whatever.
It's not showing up.
That came up in chat.
Two people asked, is Mr. Awesome the star?
Going back to some years old topics from All Games Radio, the network that we are on.
Let's get to the Skype line and quickly.
1-877-GAME-OLR If you'd like to give us a call right now, Skype line is open for business.
Or you can give us a call at username OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.
We'll get to your calls in just a moment.
While we wait for those calls to come in, because there's always a little bit of a delay, we'll get to some last minute stories.
Loki.
Yes, the new expansion for Resident Evil 5, also featured in the Gold Edition, has an Easter egg where you can actually unlock the classic camera.
You already talked about that, didn't you?
No, that was one of my stories that you didn't put in there.
Thank you.
Sorry.
You wanted to talk about that, but... Sorry.
Well, how about something else?
I've got one.
On the ESRB site, Q's working on a PixelJunk racer's second lap.
There you go.
Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio, who's this?
I just want to know Legend of Zaku Legend of Zaku, what's on your mind?
Nothing much, just recovering from another dull and lackluster weekend.
I don't know if you've probably heard about this story that was hitting up the rounds on Slashdot and I think Kotaku recently about a company, about a video game developer who had operations in Australia and apparently, since for some reason or another were trying to pull out of that country, but before they did, they actually snuck into the Australian offices and
They're developers that they had down there.
They snuck in and they actually took the code.
They took the IP from them.
Well, you know what I think about that?
What?
Well, I don't know.
What do you think?
Is this justice?
Do they have a right to go in and steal the code that they made or no?
Well, I mean, the whole situation is in a gray area.
I mean, you have on one hand
According to that company, which is Interzone, they said that because they use a third-party HR firm, they basically...
Basically, they're shifting the blame on them because they screwed up all the paperwork, the legal paperwork with the Australian tax offices.
And especially, they're also blaming that country for not giving them the incentives that they were owed for actually setting up operations there.
And then you see the developers with their other side of the story where they were overworked and to the point where
They didn't even get paid at all.
They were literally working without a paycheck.
Which, I mean, this is one of those unfortunate tales of the video game industry where you have a developer that tries to cut corners even though he's trying to make a quick dollar by trying to
Zaku, do you wear a hard hat when you call on the show?
Not really.
Oh, I was just curious.
Well, you know, if they're working for this company, though, and the company is paying them to do a job, and the job is to write code for this game... Okay, okay.
The reason why Rob was making banging noises is because that's what it sounds like when you type.
Well, it's not my fault that the microphone is so close to the webcam on my MacBook, alright?
I'm just saying, that's why Rob was making the noises and asking about the hard hat.
I can't type fluently.
I'm more of a pecker.
Anyways, that's what we're saying.
Wait, did you just say you're a pecker?
I just... Alright, let's grow.
Never!
You know, we give our favorite people the hardest time.
I know.
Look, in all seriousness, to answer the question, or respond to, I guess, the story about it, is that, you know, there's a certain kind of, like, yay hero to the story about them going in and stealing this code because the developers are screwing them over.
But the bottom line is, you know, they are signing the checks and paying them to write code for this game.
And if, you know, it doesn't work out, it's still owned by the people who signed those paychecks.
I understand that.
But when you actually go for months without paying your employee and just try to shift blame, you know, not make any any valiant effort to rectify the situation that I mean, the onus falls on that company.
Well, is this an American company?
Is this an American company?
It's basically an American company which supposedly has a studio in Australia.
They'll get the pantsuit off of them anyway.
I mean, right now, the Australian tax board, as I said, they're owed lots of back taxes.
because, you know, as I said, if they outsource human resources and payroll to an Australian company that didn't do their job, it's the parent company's responsibility to make sure that those taxes are paid and everything is settled in whatever country they're operating.
I mean, this applies for any other company that sets a shop anywhere else.
You have to play by the local... You know, they have to play by the local...
Thank you very much for the call.
Alright.
Later, dude.
All right.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hi, this is Elite Slayer.
Hey, Elite Slayer, what's on your mind?
Well, I was actually on my laptop earlier, and we were starting to talk about the Halo Reach beta, and then they were like, oh, and they wanted to know more about the Halo storyline, and I know a lot about, like,
Bungie in the storyline and so we started talking about it and then this guy came on and then we got into this full-blown argument about whether there were Spartans left in the Halo saga when like Halo 3 was happening or not and I was on the side of that there was because you know just thinking Master Chief was he and the whole storyline was kind of following him and
But you never actually realize, you know, kind of the other Spartans that there may have been less.
So, um, but the other guy was talking about this, and I don't know where these facts are coming up, but he said that, um, in Halo 2 and in Halo 3, they're talking about how he was the last Spartan, and there was, um, no one else left, and he was the only guy that could help this war, and to be honest with you, I did not play Halo 2.
Um, I mean, I've watched all the cutscenes and everything, but I didn't watch Halo, I, I watched, I didn't play Halo 2.
Even though I know what's happening from the graphics to the world's worst cliffhanger on there, but I just seriously don't know.
This is driving me crazy about whether there was actually Spartans left in Halo 3 or there wasn't.
I mean...
is there like a place in the storyline that actually says there is or isn't because how they're talking about how in Halo Reach that's new coming up you know you can play the beta on May 3rd now when it comes up but how they're talking about how he had a squad and then they're thinking they all died you know I just don't know it's driving me crazy to be honest with you out of curiosity do you have your own show because you just talked for two minutes there it was fascinating
I mean, yeah, you know, you can say I'm kind of the person that can, I can actually talk a lot, but what I like to do for fun, like this may surprise you, I like to debate a lot.
I mean, I'm not kidding you.
People will be like, after it's done, they're like, you hate me now?
I'm like, no, dude, I just did that because I was pretty much bored.
That's it, you know?
That's my personality, to be honest with you.
Elite Slayer, I'm going to answer your question quite simply.
I don't know.
Did you happen to catch the new Halo Legends anime series?
There's a lot of different backstory stuff in there too.
Yeah.
Um, yeah, I'll tell you this, though.
Um, I saw, I saw the first four episodes of Halo Legends, and I looked at it, and I'm like, oh my god, you know?
I'm like, where, because a lot of the stuff there, it does go along the series, but then it's like, some of the stuff, you know, it's like they're just pulling out of their ass, you know?
I'm like, where did this come from?
Because in, um, the third episode, they're riding these motorbike things, um, in, like, space, and, um,
It just doesn't make any sense.
But I'm starting to say um a lot.
Oh, my God.
That's all right.
You're nervous.
It's a radio show.
Okay, wait.
We've got to wrap up here and go soon.
And I've got to be honest.
I don't know the answer to your Halo question, but maybe it's the answer to one of these books or whatever.
Oh, yeah, there's books too on the whole Halo thing.
But I want to debate you real quick on a certain topic, okay, since you're a big debate person.
Let's debate.
What is cooler, keyboard playing cats or keyboard playing –
All right, dude.
I got to go with... Yeah, I heard your segment on this earlier.
I got to say cats because just think.
Cats, you've got lol cats.
Cats are crazy.
You've got these animated gifs.
You've got all these things.
It's got to be one of a cool app.
Everyone loves kittens.
They're cute.
They've got all this funny crap with them.
They're swearing.
Kittens have... They're just awesome.
Okay, well, you're wrong, and you're an idiot!
No, dude.
I know what I'm doing, okay?
You're a liar, okay?
I got this.
Kittens are awesome.
I mean, I know I can sometimes be a dog person, but online and iPhones, kittens are so much better.
They're funner.
They lighten up your day.
I mean, they make you smile.
Come on.
It comes down to this, okay?
It hurts.
The easiest way you can determine which one's cooler, which is obviously cats, is because...
Okay, dogs are trainable.
Cats are the untrainable, okay?
To train a cat to play a keyboard, well, force a cat to play a keyboard, same thing.
Why are we even talking about this?
Why?
It's so much cooler.
This is pointless conversation.
Elite Slayer, this has been a heck of a call, but I've got to let you go so we can get some more.
But thank you for your call to the show.
Yeah, okay, later, man.
You know what was awesome about that phone call?
The fact that Shermie went and hid?
Not a damn thing came of it.
We never even bothered to answer his question.
Then he took two minutes to ask.
Dude, Wikipedia.
Halo Wiki.
The whole chat room is going, gong, gong, please end this.
Make it stop.
Why are you doing this to me?
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
This is somebody who's not going to fap into a keyboard or sit there and get in a stupid conversation about stupid stuff like Halo.
Are you sure?
Oh, I'm definitely sure.
Dude, really?
What's on your mind?
Who is this?
What's up, guys?
This is X-Link.
This is X-Link.
Hi, X-Link.
What's on your mind?
Nothing much, man.
Just getting ready to shoot myself in the head with DMs calling every... Oh, I'm not going to get into it, seriously.
X-Link, it's the show where every gamer has a voice.
No, it's going to be soon.
It's going to be called... Next time you go in, wow, I'm going to put a hit on you with every single Horde member going after you for a surprise money for putting DS Master on the line.
It's going to be like an episode of The Guild, which, by the way, tangent, I watched the entirety of season one and two of The Guild last night with Alan because...
Everything was packed, except for the computer, because if you're a nerd, the computer's the last thing you pack.
So all I had was instant Netflix, because the PS3 was packed, all the DVDs were packed.
So we decided to watch instant Netflix, and I don't know if you know, but The Guild is now available seasons one and two on Netflix.
And you just kind of reminded me of one of the episodes where one of the guildies is kind of leading a secret double life to make one of the other guild members that she's mad at make his life hell.
I don't know, what did you think of The Guild?
Oh, I loved it.
Oh, you've seen it?
X-Link?
I'm sorry?
You've seen it, X-Link?
Oh, yes, yes, definitely, yeah.
I've seen both seasons, yes.
It's a little bit over the top for me.
Some of it's just a little too out there, but for nerd lols, it's pretty good.
What did you think, Alan?
You watched it too with me.
Did you like it?
Yeah, it was good.
I've been on WoW for about two or three months, so I get all the jokes now.
Yeah, there you go.
All right, what did you really call in to talk about tonight?
No, I was calling about the Ubisoft and what bastardization they're doing with the whole DRM and that stuff.
You know, like I said before, and besides the Imagination series and stuff like that, don't forget they also did the CSI series.
They were also part of the Press Your Luck, which, oh yeah, thanks Ubisoft.
Now I can't play any of those cool game show games.
You just hit a whammy.
Congrats.
Yeah.
So yeah, so now you're going to stop me from playing those as well.
And my mom, because my mom likes this series of games.
So you're going to make her stop because she doesn't have the internet connection in her place.
Bravo on that.
Though I know there's going to be a patch and there's going to be ways of getting around it.
So I'm not the least bit worried.
But still, I mean, just the fact that it's going to be a headache just for all that, you know.
And like you said before, it's going to be a headache.
You're going to have all these people who doesn't know all these different ways around it.
They're going to sit here and they're going to flood the support lines because of all this, you know.
And you can't take a PC game back to the store.
So best of luck on that.
So I...
Do you think, though, that it's going to work?
I mean, don't you think it's just going to get cracked within a couple days?
It will get cracked, but you've got to realize, too, a lot of people don't know this different stuff that we do.
And a lot of these people I'm going to feel bad for because they're going to buy the game, they're going to open it up, they're going to put it in, they're not realizing this is going to happen.
And once they realize it's going to happen, they're going to try to take it back to the store.
And they're going to be like, the store's going to be like, sorry, that's tough.
You should have known that beforehand.
I think you and I are on the same page there.
You don't want to debate me like the last caller did.
That's... Boring.
I know.
Alright.
Well, what else?
Anything else on your mind tonight, X-Link, before we let you go?
No, that was pretty much about it.
I just thought it was kind of interesting when I was hearing about all that.
There's more games than just the Imagination series.
With all these things we're seeing between the Ubisoft news and then we're talking about the whole SOCOM or whatever that game is on PSP that's going to have the multiplayer is going to charge if you didn't buy it new.
You're going to see all these inventive things.
It's not even the beginning of the end.
And the interesting thing about that would be that also is I would love to see the responses from people from eBay that don't know about it.
They buy the game used for their son or something, and then they figure out, you know, the son wants to play multiplayer.
They figure out they have to charge $20 for it to get to multiplayer.
That's going to be interesting to see the results of that.
Yeah, interesting as in about like a 20-car pileup on the side of the road.
All right, XLink, got to let you go, buddy.
But have a good one, okay?
No problem.
You too.
Bye.
We just have call after call tonight.
Let's go to another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, folks.
It's SSJ100 Matt.
Hi, SSJ100 Matt.
What's on your mind tonight?
Not much.
Definitely not Halo Reach.
But by the way, keyboard Zaku cats are better.
Oh, I see.
When it talks about keyboard cat and dog cat, ZakuCat wins.
That's fair.
Did you say dog cat?
Did I say dog cat?
You said dog cat.
I probably did say dog cat.
Well, you know, SSJ100Matt now is going to make me think of the whole shark and octopus videos with all the YouTubes he was linking tonight, which were A-plus videos, by the way.
When you can get videos to get a laugh on a radio show, you've done a good job.
Yeah.
So, um, actually, one thing I did want to talk about is, that will actually get us to the debate, you know, I'm talking about the, the USL Madness going on in the forums.
Uh-huh, yes, we played a little promo from, uh, Breslow a little earlier.
What do you think about what's going on there?
Well, I'm just, I'm just kind of amazed at just the amount of, like, heat that's going on in there.
Like, right now, Pokemon is beating Final Fantasy VII nine votes to four.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
My question is, are a lot of people just voting against Final Fantasy VII because they just hate the fact that it's overhyped?
I don't know.
I think there's a large generation of modern fans that really just do not like Final Fantasy VII.
I think it's a little bit of both.
I think you have some genuine Pokemon fans, but I think some of that is anti-Final Fantasy VII votes too.
I think like any great political race, there's something like that going on there.
I wish there was more of a sampling of our audience voting in those polls, but what can you do?
But also, you know, we got Symphony of the Night losing to Legend of Zelda, which, you know, that's a good matchup.
Yeah, you know, I can't get mad about that.
To be honest, I can't get mad about the Pokemon 1 too.
I realize Pokemon has its rabid fanbase.
I mean, the anime is still going, and it's been going for, what, like at least 10 years now?
I mean, the anime is just not losing steam, and I get it.
Like, if it was losing to a game like, I don't know, Blades of Steel...
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on there.
Hold on there.
Hold on there.
Now listen here.
I'm kidding.
I just wanted to start something.
Yeah.
But, um, no, I mean, no, my point is, you know, if you genuinely like Pokemon and think it's a better game, then I'm cool with that.
But, you know, if you just like, if you're voting against the game that, you know...
Just because it's overhyped or everyone likes it, like you said, haters to the left.
and I think 6 is still in it so you know I'm okay that if 7's out this round and one of the other Final Fantasy games continues but what's weird about the whole setup of the way and it's just I guess the way the cards fell and I know John has this very specific way of seeding everything in the match but it's really weird how like 3 Mario games and like 3 Zelda games are likely to take up the top 32 then again you know maybe Zelda and Mario shouldn't be so good
I know they're good games, I get it, but it's just weird.
Maybe I'm saying that because some of the games got grouped as series and some didn't, but I'm sure it had a lot to do with how people's lists were.
If you even look at my list, I probably did have two different Zelda games on it and two different Mario games on it.
They are really good series, but it's just interesting that we're going to be down to 16 and half of that is going to be Zelda and Mario.
Hey, you know, listen, I put Blades of Steel as number one.
I know you did.
Kind of jokingly, but you know, I, if you saw, you know, I wrote a ridiculous manifesto, just jokingly, but you know.
No, I know.
And Blades of Steel was a great game.
You know what?
I don't play a lot of sports games.
I really don't.
But I owned Blades of Steel on the NES.
That's how good it was.
It was a great game.
And it had Grotty's.
Only sports can ever know.
Grotty's Minigame.
All right, well, that's the show.
I'm Matt.
We're going to let you go so we can wrap things up.
But thanks so much for your call.
Yep, take it easy, man.
Have a good one.
Alright, apologies to those who didn't get through tonight.
We took like four calls tonight.
Usually when I take three, so send us an email if you didn't get through or a tweet.
We always appreciate those and we'll talk to you guys hopefully next time on Orange Lounge Radio.
But many, many different ways to interact with the show.
Chat room, Twitter, all that good stuff.
I think all the calls we got tonight were people that weren't on last week.
So it's good to kind of, or maybe Zaku was, I don't know.
But it's good to kind of spread the love a little bit.
Alright, we're going to go around and kind of start to wrap up the show, but first we've got to make sure all of our last minute stories are cleared out.
Anything else you guys wanted to bring up tonight?
Loki?
DarkSakura?
I like chocolate.
That's not a news-breaking story.
There's a few things from AOU 2010, the arcade expo that's in Japan.
They're showing off some of the new things, including Sega is bringing Project Diva to the arcades.
It's a rhythm music game.
Kind of looks a little bit like a cross between... I don't know.
Something like maybe a Parappa-type game with...
Oh, wow.
That Namco singing game.
I don't know.
Basically, it's just, you know, like a music rhythm game with chicks singing stuff.
It looks neat.
It's got these, not really poppin' music buttons, but it's basically got four buttons that kind of match the PlayStation face buttons.
So that's kind of neat.
And that'll be coming to arcades, I imagine, pretty soon.
Another one that they showed off that was actually really huge was Metal Gear Arcade.
Talk about one hell of a complex cabinet.
Oh yeah, I heard about this.
It's got these 3D glasses, head tracking built into those, it's like a goggle type thing.
You have a gun that you use and just...
Talk about... Well, that's just begging to get broken.
Yeah, talk about detailed, so that's kind of cool.
I don't know when that's going to be coming out.
Then we were talking, there's apparently there was some concern because of the rumors that Final Fantasy XIV is coming out this year that Final Fantasy XI will be going by the wayside with the release of that.
Is that for real?
Because I did remember before I had no internet after the move, I remember reading that story and I was like, there's no official word from Square Enix.
This seems like a rumor run wild.
Well, that's the thing.
It's not.
It's not going to be going by the wayside.
In fact, Wada tweeted, there seems to be a rumor that Final Fantasy XI is ending, but if that was done, we'd be in trouble.
Yoichi Wada Yoichi Wada
No, they can't shut down Eleven right now just to make room for 14.
EverQuest 1 and 2 ran at the same time and all these other ones that have sequels.
City of Heroes and Villains are running at the same time.
One's not going to close because the other is out.
Might there be server consolidations?
Yeah, that could happen and probably will happen.
I bet Eleven has a server consolidation by the end of the year.
But it's not going to close.
Not going to close.
And then the last thing, you remember that we mentioned that Perfect Dark would be coming to Xbox Live Arcade during March?
Well, with that will be the GoldenEye 007 maps from the game on Nintendo 64.
Those will be also coming to Perfect Dark as well as possibly the weapons.
Sneaky sneaky.
Thank you so much for coming and being on the show tonight.
I know you didn't get to say a whole lot, but I hope you had fun.
I did.
Thanks for having me.
No problem.
Come again sometime and don't be afraid to speak your mind.
It's where every gamer has a voice, Alan.
Do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?
My cat's breath smells like cat food.
Loki, your final thought tonight?
My final thought is I get to take off work tomorrow because I am sick.
My final thought is looking at the Dragon Quest slime on Dan's desk kind of makes me want to play Dragon Quest VIII.
I don't know why, but it was kind of cool.
DarkSakura, your final thought.
I'm totally addicted to this Sailor Senshi doll maker.
You are the reason Ubisoft has a market for those designer dress games.
No, I'm kidding.
No, probably you're right.
Actually, I'm kind of jealous watching you play.
No, thanks a lot, of course, for tuning in to our show and supporting and downloading and listening to Independent Radio.
We really appreciate it.
We do this show for free.
All we ask, if you enjoyed what you heard...
Outro Music
Even when it's an off night like tonight.
But you know what?
The whole chat room seems to be into it.
So hey, good times.
Thank you guys.
We really appreciate the support.
And we'll be back to do it all again next week.
What do you guys think?
Why not?
Why not?
So for myself, Alan, Loki, Jamie, and Shermie, good night.
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio
Thanks for watching!
