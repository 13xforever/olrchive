1
00:00:13,971 --> 00:00:18,417
[SPEAKER_15]: Tonight, February 28th, 2010, which country has banned Heavy Rain?

2
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:25,047
[SPEAKER_15]: A date is announced for the Final Fantasy XIV beta, and a Nintendo press event brings us a barrage of Wii and DS news.

3
00:00:31,294 --> 00:00:42,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello my friends and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, that talk show on the internet, live every Sunday night, dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:42,257 --> 00:00:44,477
[SPEAKER_06]: It is the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:44,497 --> 00:00:54,540
[SPEAKER_06]: We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern Time at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.

6
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,741
[SPEAKER_06]: A big thanks to them for letting us steal their bandwidth every single week.

7
00:00:58,174 --> 00:00:58,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Meh.

8
00:01:04,568 --> 00:01:04,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Meh.

9
00:01:05,048 --> 00:01:05,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Meh.

10
00:01:05,768 --> 00:01:06,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Meh.

11
00:01:07,408 --> 00:01:10,649
[SPEAKER_09]: I have one thing to say to the California government.

12
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:11,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Meh.

13
00:01:11,809 --> 00:01:12,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck.

14
00:01:12,389 --> 00:01:14,890
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll get into that in a little bit during housekeeping, absolutely.

15
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,830
[SPEAKER_06]: If you wonder what she's talking about.

16
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,651
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not just an unbalanced budget, but there's other stuff going on.

17
00:01:19,671 --> 00:01:20,411
[SPEAKER_06]: You've probably heard.

18
00:01:20,771 --> 00:01:23,591
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's made those water cooler press stories this week.

19
00:01:24,111 --> 00:01:26,092
[SPEAKER_06]: And boy, do we have the response for you.

20
00:01:26,112 --> 00:01:27,252
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to get into that in a little bit.

21
00:01:28,312 --> 00:01:30,272
[SPEAKER_06]: We do talk games too, right, Tech Master Loki?

22
00:01:30,452 --> 00:01:31,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Also here joining us every week.

23
00:01:31,693 --> 00:01:32,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, every now and then.

24
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:33,153
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing, Loki?

25
00:01:33,573 --> 00:01:34,794
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing okay Yeah, I'm boycotting him

26
00:02:03,607 --> 00:02:05,208
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody with any taste is.

27
00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:07,410
[SPEAKER_06]: My grandma's happy, I'll tell you that.

28
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's get into our gaming weeks.

29
00:02:09,932 --> 00:02:20,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, once in a while we do talk about video games here, and we let the gamers have a voice in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, but don't worry, if you're not listening live, if you're listening on the podcast feed, there are a million billion ways to communicate with the show.

30
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:23,763
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's a social network for it, we're probably on it somewhere.

31
00:02:24,504 --> 00:02:30,089
[SPEAKER_06]: The Twitters, the Facebooks, we take emails every week, all of it, and phone calls later on too, so...

32
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:31,490
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

33
00:02:54,945 --> 00:03:01,012
[SPEAKER_09]: I've had lots of homework to do and lots of responsibilities to take care of, so I haven't really played anything.

34
00:03:01,052 --> 00:03:02,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you've got to take a break once in a while.

35
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:08,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I've tried to play my Sims 3 and it probably hates my mods, so I have to reinstall it, so whatever.

36
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:10,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Loki, how about you?

37
00:03:10,503 --> 00:03:11,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you been playing anything this week?

38
00:03:12,861 --> 00:03:14,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a lot of Borderlands.

39
00:03:15,423 --> 00:03:20,287
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been trying to go through and finish Mad Moxie's Underdome.

40
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:25,811
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately didn't get a chance to do that because the ones I'm on now are the 20 round matches.

41
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:31,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Which each round has 5 waves in it and it takes forever.

42
00:03:31,596 --> 00:03:31,856
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

43
00:03:33,257 --> 00:03:37,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I made it only through seven rounds before I realized I'm not going to be able to finish it in the time that I had.

44
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:41,780
[SPEAKER_02]: So I quit that and played a little bit more just the standard campaign now.

45
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,163
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm almost maxed out as far as my level goes.

46
00:03:48,423 --> 00:03:54,605
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am kind of trying to collect some weapons and stuff because I downloaded the new expansion.

47
00:03:56,646 --> 00:03:59,687
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, the new expansion kills any mods that you have.

48
00:04:00,427 --> 00:04:00,728
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

49
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:03,770
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

50
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:23,867
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

51
00:04:24,288 --> 00:04:24,728
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be fun.

52
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,952
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, more Grand Theft Auto.

53
00:04:28,793 --> 00:04:30,515
[SPEAKER_02]: And doing well on that.

54
00:04:30,595 --> 00:04:32,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Still trying to move up the leaderboards.

55
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:40,627
[SPEAKER_02]: And I broke 200 now for cumulative ranked deathmatches.

56
00:04:43,056 --> 00:04:53,806
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I think, almost like in the 60s for TrueSkill rankings, so it's going pretty well.

57
00:04:53,846 --> 00:04:55,307
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be up there pretty soon.

58
00:04:55,608 --> 00:05:00,092
[SPEAKER_02]: The only problem is, though, is those guys that are actually in the top of the TrueSkill ranks...

59
00:05:00,652 --> 00:05:04,935
[SPEAKER_02]: They tend not to want to play games that they're losing.

60
00:05:05,376 --> 00:05:09,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently they drop out and so their rank doesn't go down.

61
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,762
[SPEAKER_02]: So I actually did run into some people.

62
00:05:12,782 --> 00:05:18,126
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually ran into the number one player and the number six player and both of them did not want to play me.

63
00:05:19,207 --> 00:05:21,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is too bad because I would have kicked the crap out of them.

64
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:22,509
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

65
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:23,931
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm playing this week.

66
00:05:24,711 --> 00:05:25,892
[SPEAKER_06]: And you still have a cold.

67
00:05:25,932 --> 00:05:27,874
[SPEAKER_06]: You were sick last week and you're still sick.

68
00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:29,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you feeling okay?

69
00:05:30,276 --> 00:05:31,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you need some medication?

70
00:05:31,678 --> 00:05:32,218
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm fine.

71
00:05:32,238 --> 00:05:33,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I took two days off this week.

72
00:05:34,741 --> 00:05:36,162
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I play a lot of Borderlands.

73
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:38,944
[SPEAKER_02]: And did other things.

74
00:05:41,346 --> 00:05:44,108
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't really go into that because wife would not be happy.

75
00:05:44,808 --> 00:05:45,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright then.

76
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:46,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine.

77
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, my gaming week.

78
00:05:48,411 --> 00:05:52,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I had a week similar to Jamie's where a lot of real life stuff is coming into play.

79
00:05:53,113 --> 00:05:57,556
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still working on the whole moving thing which will be done like tomorrow, so thankfully.

80
00:05:58,676 --> 00:05:59,817
[SPEAKER_06]: But I did play a little bit.

81
00:05:59,857 --> 00:06:01,578
[SPEAKER_06]: I did get into World of Warcraft, of course.

82
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,500
[SPEAKER_06]: My boyfriend and I have been leveling together.

83
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,301
[SPEAKER_06]: I helped him kind of get started with the character.

84
00:06:06,341 --> 00:06:07,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, no, I take that back.

85
00:06:07,121 --> 00:06:09,643
[SPEAKER_06]: He started the character and by the time it got to about...

86
00:06:10,383 --> 00:06:12,804
[SPEAKER_06]: about level 21, I don't remember, 23, somewhere in there.

87
00:06:12,824 --> 00:06:16,066
[SPEAKER_06]: We started leveling together and now we just hit 50 this weekend.

88
00:06:16,106 --> 00:06:17,546
[SPEAKER_06]: So yay to leveling.

89
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,148
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of fun to have somebody to always play WoW with.

90
00:06:20,228 --> 00:06:20,868
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cool.

91
00:06:20,968 --> 00:06:28,792
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm really trying to get as much Borderlands in this week because I have a feeling I'm going to have Final Fantasy XIII by the end of this week and oh my god, everything's going to stop.

92
00:06:28,892 --> 00:06:29,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, wait, wait.

93
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:31,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Is your connection getting that early?

94
00:06:31,613 --> 00:06:33,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I want to place an order if so.

95
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:38,936
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we have extras, but I will check.

96
00:07:03,109 --> 00:07:09,131
[SPEAKER_06]: We had this story where it came up at some point during the show that the former Midway games had all disappeared from Xbox Live.

97
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:10,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Joust and Smash TV.

98
00:07:10,812 --> 00:07:13,013
[SPEAKER_06]: So I had a night where I just decided to play a bunch of retro games.

99
00:07:13,053 --> 00:07:14,213
[SPEAKER_06]: I went in and I played Joust.

100
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,174
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I actually played Smash TV.

101
00:07:16,594 --> 00:07:19,075
[SPEAKER_06]: I started playing Gyruss for a while for some weird reason.

102
00:07:19,496 --> 00:07:21,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's not a weird reason.

103
00:07:21,056 --> 00:07:21,877
[SPEAKER_06]: I just really love that game.

104
00:07:21,897 --> 00:07:23,297
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of my favorite shooters from the 80s.

105
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,699
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually beat my former high score, which isn't very good.

106
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:27,519
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to work on it.

107
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:33,941
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Gyruss and a lot of the old arcade games, admittedly, is all about memorization, like knowing where the ships come from in every wave.

108
00:07:34,341 --> 00:07:36,681
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just really need to kind of work on it for a little while.

109
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:37,761
[SPEAKER_06]: But I got a better score.

110
00:07:37,781 --> 00:07:38,482
[SPEAKER_06]: So that made me happy.

111
00:07:38,522 --> 00:07:41,202
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I beat my score on another old game, too.

112
00:07:41,242 --> 00:07:42,443
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can't remember which one it was.

113
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:44,763
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember if it was Time Pilot or no, I think it was like Tempest.

114
00:07:45,303 --> 00:07:46,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, though, my score is still not very good.

115
00:07:47,024 --> 00:07:47,724
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to work on it.

116
00:07:47,984 --> 00:07:55,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, as I mentioned, one of the things I did while I was sick is worked on something that my wife would not like.

117
00:07:55,868 --> 00:07:59,310
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is I'm building up our top arcade cabinet for work.

118
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,771
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's actually coming along pretty well.

119
00:08:02,831 --> 00:08:03,532
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks pretty nice.

120
00:08:04,332 --> 00:08:06,953
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

121
00:08:28,522 --> 00:08:30,343
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

122
00:08:51,693 --> 00:08:57,065
[SPEAKER_02]: But for some reason, the Naomi version of Marvel vs. Capcom 2 still has slowdowns in it.

123
00:08:57,145 --> 00:09:01,354
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not by my computer because it's certainly fast enough.

124
00:09:02,628 --> 00:09:05,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me ask kind of like a random MAME question, because I'm going to be honest.

125
00:09:05,789 --> 00:09:09,711
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't played MAME, the arcade emulator, in quite a long time.

126
00:09:11,071 --> 00:09:18,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Did it ever get to the point where it does more things online, like the exchange of high scores or an online leaderboard or something?

127
00:09:18,594 --> 00:09:24,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I really see that as being some of the big appeal of Game Room to me, the legitimate MAME or whatever you want to call it.

128
00:09:24,516 --> 00:09:30,018
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's really cool that I'm going to have leaderboards with friends and some of that medals and achievements element.

129
00:09:30,318 --> 00:09:31,559
[SPEAKER_06]: MAME is just...

130
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:32,979
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com

131
00:10:02,392 --> 00:10:09,258
[SPEAKER_02]: They do have patches now that will save your high scores, but nothing that you can play online with each other.

132
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:20,027
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other programs out there like Mess or Misfit Mame, which will run all sorts of hacked games.

133
00:10:21,268 --> 00:10:26,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe those will have some sort of online play or something, but Mame does not.

134
00:10:27,513 --> 00:10:33,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, it does make sense, though, that there's not a lot of frills because MAME is sort of in that really gray area of legality as it is.

135
00:10:33,739 --> 00:10:41,607
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's nothing wrong with the MAME program itself, but it's the fact that the ROMs are not legal except for a handful.

136
00:10:41,647 --> 00:10:45,591
[SPEAKER_06]: There have been a few that the original creators of the game have come back and said...

137
00:10:45,991 --> 00:10:49,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was like 25 years ago, and we're not going to make any money off of it.

138
00:10:50,012 --> 00:10:52,793
[SPEAKER_06]: So we hereby release it in the public domain.

139
00:10:52,813 --> 00:10:53,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Woohoo, have fun.

140
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:55,114
[SPEAKER_06]: There have been a handful of those games.

141
00:10:55,654 --> 00:11:04,716
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think if MAME were to come in and say, oh, we're going to implement this online leaderboard for this game, it would really kind of start to push the boundaries of the gray area of legality.

142
00:11:04,736 --> 00:11:05,656
[SPEAKER_02]: It would just be tough.

143
00:11:05,676 --> 00:11:09,457
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be tough to do it, and it'd be tough to make sure people aren't cheating in it.

144
00:11:09,677 --> 00:11:09,878
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

145
00:11:11,518 --> 00:11:12,318
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd just be too difficult.

146
00:11:12,378 --> 00:11:14,359
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do believe, actually, that...

147
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:23,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Macaron or maybe Demol, one of the Dreamcast emulators, is actually doing online.

148
00:11:23,692 --> 00:11:26,075
[SPEAKER_02]: You can play multiplayer over the internet.

149
00:11:26,235 --> 00:11:26,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's cool.

150
00:11:27,277 --> 00:11:30,882
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know those do Naomi games, so like Marvel vs. Capcom 2 or...

151
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Did they ever perfect it on the NES or SNES?

152
00:11:47,222 --> 00:11:48,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I think those have gotten better.

153
00:11:48,522 --> 00:11:48,822
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

154
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:50,263
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't play over the internet with that stuff.

155
00:11:50,403 --> 00:11:51,003
[SPEAKER_02]: The same with MAME.

156
00:11:51,023 --> 00:11:53,684
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's my cabinet.

157
00:11:54,044 --> 00:11:57,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, the motherboard in it is really cheap.

158
00:11:57,785 --> 00:12:01,066
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, anytime I overclock it, the ethernet stops working.

159
00:12:01,606 --> 00:12:06,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I've always said I would love Nintendo's Virtual Console if it was on Xbox Live.

160
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:16,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're going to get into this more later, but I'm honestly surprised at the release schedule that they have right now, so maybe they are coming around.

161
00:12:17,053 --> 00:12:28,180
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because that's basically all the games that they announced at E3 coming out before E3 this year, so it's like, okay, clean slate, what are you going to announce for the rest of the year, you know?

162
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we'll get into that a little bit, though.

163
00:12:30,341 --> 00:12:32,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we get into the gaming news, let me do some housekeeping tonight.

164
00:12:32,743 --> 00:12:37,247
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have a whole lot of housekeeping here in-house, but something DarkSakura referenced a little earlier in the show.

165
00:12:37,287 --> 00:12:39,628
[SPEAKER_06]: I just kind of wanted to share this and throw this out there with you guys.

166
00:12:40,229 --> 00:12:48,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, the California State Assembly passed a measure this week that is going to support anti-swearing week, or what do they call it?

167
00:12:48,195 --> 00:12:49,256
[SPEAKER_06]: No cussing week, right?

168
00:12:49,276 --> 00:12:49,996
[SPEAKER_06]: The first week of March.

169
00:12:50,016 --> 00:12:50,717
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, something like that.

170
00:12:50,797 --> 00:12:54,160
[SPEAKER_06]: So starting Monday, because today's the last day of February, believe it or not.

171
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,922
[SPEAKER_06]: So starting Monday, it is no cuss week in California.

172
00:12:57,322 --> 00:13:02,248
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you so much as say fuck out loud, you're going to get hauled off to jail.

173
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,070
[SPEAKER_06]: No, okay, it's not really like that.

174
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,491
[SPEAKER_06]: What it is, I don't know.

175
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:12,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Some kid in a club in California started this no cussing club.

176
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:39,776
[SPEAKER_06]: and it caught on amongst all these people that think if you cuss then clearly you're not intelligent because only unintelligent people have to fill their vocabulary with cuss words blah blah blah I don't know something along those lines so somehow this got all the way to the state assembly while we are in the midst of a budget crisis yet again mind you and you know we can't even go to the DMV anymore because we're not even sure when they're actually open because they're closed half the time anyway sorry I don't want to get on the political tangent here too much

177
00:13:40,877 --> 00:13:53,653
[SPEAKER_06]: So they found time to pass this resolution to support the No Cussing Week, and they're encouraging that everybody should keep a swear jar, and you should, you know, where if you say fuck or damn or whatever, you should put in 25 cents into the swear jar.

178
00:13:54,715 --> 00:13:54,935
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

179
00:13:56,597 --> 00:14:12,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and you should donate this to charity, to Haiti or probably Chile now, and obviously our thoughts to everybody who was affected by that recent thing, and I don't have a problem with donating to charity, but I think I have a little bit of a problem with...

180
00:14:12,995 --> 00:14:17,716
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the government endorsing something that sort of infringes on freedom of speech.

181
00:14:17,796 --> 00:14:18,876
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, call me crazy.

182
00:14:19,516 --> 00:14:24,617
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you look at this dude's website for the No Cussing Club, they're selling books.

183
00:14:25,057 --> 00:14:28,078
[SPEAKER_06]: They're selling charters on how to start your own club.

184
00:14:28,378 --> 00:14:30,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Gee, the guy's profiting off this idea.

185
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:33,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they taxing him?

186
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:34,479
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope so.

187
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what?

188
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:41,841
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't knock him for profiting off of it because if people are dumb enough to pay him for it, then...

189
00:14:43,635 --> 00:14:43,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

190
00:14:43,955 --> 00:14:47,137
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's what capitalism is built on.

191
00:14:47,677 --> 00:14:48,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Profiting off the stupid.

192
00:14:49,538 --> 00:14:51,098
[SPEAKER_06]: This state is... I'm sorry.

193
00:14:51,118 --> 00:14:57,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I don't mean to get on the political train, but this does affect video games because this is the home of Silicon Valley and where a lot of the games are made.

194
00:14:57,801 --> 00:15:01,683
[SPEAKER_06]: So if the state goes belly up, so are a lot of your favorite game publishers.

195
00:15:02,363 --> 00:15:05,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, but this non-cussing week is about as...

196
00:15:21,523 --> 00:15:24,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk Like a Pirate Day has not been endorsed by the state of California.

197
00:15:24,826 --> 00:15:28,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk Like a Pirate Day is an internet meme, basically, that's gone crazy.

198
00:15:28,989 --> 00:15:29,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

199
00:15:29,749 --> 00:15:30,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it a 4chan thing?

200
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,251
[SPEAKER_06]: It might as well be.

201
00:15:32,311 --> 00:15:33,132
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those things.

202
00:15:33,372 --> 00:15:44,841
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically about that important as far as... I would say even less important than Talk Like a Pirate Day because that's actually kind of cool.

203
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:46,121
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about that important like...

204
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:48,804
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

205
00:15:57,182 --> 00:15:57,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Who cares?

206
00:16:19,304 --> 00:16:42,888
[SPEAKER_06]: I can say them and nobody can take that right away because I live in America which is great but I'm glad you brought that up because next week's show will fall during No Cussing Week so I do want to point out we here at OLR we do have our plan and we are going to bring you OLR Presents our No Cussing Week show next week so we're looking very much forward to that so stay tuned so OLR celebrates No Cussing Week in the state of California next week

207
00:16:43,448 --> 00:16:43,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Celebrate?

208
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:48,295
[SPEAKER_02]: But why are we giving them more fuel for their fire?

209
00:16:48,555 --> 00:16:49,076
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be fun.

210
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:53,822
[SPEAKER_06]: We like to challenge ourselves here at Orange Lounge Radio.

211
00:16:54,804 --> 00:16:56,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's challenge ourselves with some video game news tonight.

212
00:16:56,987 --> 00:16:57,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

213
00:16:59,109 --> 00:17:00,409
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to fucking do it.

214
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:05,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I had to get that out of there.

215
00:17:06,011 --> 00:17:09,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so this is kind of interesting.

216
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:20,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, the PS3 developers have now 70 megabytes of additional RAM unlocked to be able to use in their games.

217
00:17:21,494 --> 00:17:43,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony apparently has been upgrading the PS3 over the past few months and doing so they've dropped the OS's memory footprint from 120 megabytes to 50 megabytes and basically allowing the system to use less RAM and therefore being able to pass on the RAM to other developers.

218
00:17:43,589 --> 00:17:47,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, is that going to really make a difference?

219
00:17:47,892 --> 00:17:48,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not.

220
00:17:48,473 --> 00:17:48,773
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

221
00:17:50,968 --> 00:17:52,149
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll help.

222
00:17:52,770 --> 00:18:00,356
[SPEAKER_02]: They won't have to optimize their code as much, but as PS3 developers have basically said, any bit of RAM helps.

223
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:01,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Neat.

224
00:18:03,581 --> 00:18:08,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I guess a little bit of RAM is better than none, but, well, I mean, sorry.

225
00:18:09,183 --> 00:18:11,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, there is RAM in the system as it is, but you know what I mean.

226
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,045
[SPEAKER_06]: The more RAM, the merrier.

227
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:20,868
[SPEAKER_06]: But how is it that this console's been out for so long, and now they're saying, hey, we've unlocked this hidden RAM.

228
00:18:21,188 --> 00:18:24,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it just because they've optimized processes and systems?

229
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:27,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they've just optimized their operating system.

230
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:33,193
[SPEAKER_02]: They basically found new ways to do different things, and now, because it's optimized, they don't need as much RAM.

231
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:40,202
[SPEAKER_06]: But I wouldn't expect that suddenly all these games are going to have uber better graphics and all this stuff.

232
00:18:40,242 --> 00:18:43,083
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, 70 megs of RAM is not that much when all is said and done.

233
00:18:43,103 --> 00:18:49,187
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's going to be like an extra, maybe an extra splish splash in the water effect or an extra little dangling light somewhere in Silent Hill.

234
00:18:49,207 --> 00:18:49,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not anything.

235
00:18:49,707 --> 00:19:00,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised they're not using it for like, you know, more features in the operating system, you know, custom soundtracks in all the games, you know.

236
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:05,236
[SPEAKER_02]: and CrossGameChat, which I think is still there now, hopefully.

237
00:19:06,697 --> 00:19:08,759
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, video chat or something like that.

238
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:09,159
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

239
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,380
[SPEAKER_02]: They could be using that RAM for something.

240
00:19:12,842 --> 00:19:13,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, I don't know.

241
00:19:13,742 --> 00:19:14,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

242
00:19:15,443 --> 00:19:19,626
[SPEAKER_02]: These consoles, you know, have been out for a while and put more RAM in them.

243
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:25,591
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like gigs of RAM instead of like half a gig or whatever the hell's in these.

244
00:19:25,811 --> 00:19:27,372
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's not more than a gig.

245
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:48,896
[SPEAKER_06]: it's pathetic but they can't up it after the console's already out because then the games that are released may not work on the older system so it's just like you have a new console out there like remember like I'm thinking of the Nintendo 64 memory pack like didn't you have to have that little memory pack in order to play like Majora's Mask I think was the biggest game with that

246
00:19:49,204 --> 00:20:01,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Some games, yes, but here's the thing is, like the PSP, they double the RAM that they have for their, well, it's mainly for their web browser, but it can be done.

247
00:20:01,888 --> 00:20:06,070
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, all it would do is those games would run smoother.

248
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:10,311
[SPEAKER_06]: I see, but games would still have to be optimized for the lowest common denominator, really.

249
00:20:10,471 --> 00:20:10,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

250
00:20:11,192 --> 00:20:12,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Or else they're going to find themselves in trouble.

251
00:20:12,992 --> 00:20:17,194
[SPEAKER_02]: But eventually they would phase that out, you know, phase out the old systems and...

252
00:20:18,274 --> 00:20:26,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well one system that doesn't seem to be getting any upgrades in its near future is the Nintendo Wii, but that doesn't stop Nintendo from trying to crank out the big, big games.

253
00:20:26,538 --> 00:20:30,320
[SPEAKER_06]: And they had a big press event this week, we're going to focus on the next few stories talking about for a moment.

254
00:20:31,341 --> 00:20:34,522
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course some big, big titles coming out of this press event that happened this week.

255
00:20:35,623 --> 00:21:04,544
[SPEAKER_06]: two of them being Mario Galaxy 2 and Metroid Other M sounds like Super Mario Galaxy 2 and Metroid Other M are both going to be out mid-year which was a little bit of a surprise because I think a lot of us were thinking even though Other M was shown at last E3 we were kind of thinking oh it's early it's going to be out this holiday season but no both these games have now been dated for mid-year so Mario Galaxy 2 I believe they've said they've even said like what May I think and Metroid Other M is going to be out in June yes

256
00:21:04,844 --> 00:21:07,886
[SPEAKER_06]: So, June 27th, which is the day after my birthday, I believe.

257
00:21:08,407 --> 00:21:14,311
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, it's kind of exciting these games are coming out so soon, but what's that mean for the rest of the year?

258
00:21:14,751 --> 00:21:16,652
[SPEAKER_06]: What big titles does Nintendo have left?

259
00:21:16,752 --> 00:21:19,794
[SPEAKER_02]: They've already hinted that they're going to announce a new Zelda game that's going to come out at the end of the year.

260
00:21:19,894 --> 00:21:21,536
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's basically what's going to happen.

261
00:21:21,556 --> 00:21:24,338
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have a new Zelda game, probably running in the Twilight Princess engine.

262
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,260
[SPEAKER_02]: And that'll be the new game this year.

263
00:21:28,701 --> 00:21:30,322
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone will go buck wild over it.

264
00:21:31,122 --> 00:21:40,026
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I guess some of the early impressions are out over these games, and Super Mario Galaxy 2 is pretty much Super Mario Galaxy 1, but some new worlds and new features and things.

265
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:41,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a lot of differences, though.

266
00:21:42,027 --> 00:21:43,407
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like the game has suddenly changed.

267
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,328
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it has to be.

268
00:21:44,788 --> 00:21:47,249
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as it has Be Mario, who's going to care?

269
00:21:47,269 --> 00:21:52,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, it was a good game, so you don't really need to change it.

270
00:21:54,406 --> 00:22:15,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Metroid Other M, on the other hand, finally we're getting some more details out of that, and it does sound like it's going to be a direct sequel to Super Metroid, which you know has me excited, because I think Super Metroid's the greatest game they ever made, so hearing that this is a direct sequel, well, I do also approach that with caution, because there's a part of me that goes, they could really screw this up, but apparently they have a whole rendered...

271
00:22:15,985 --> 00:22:17,967
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm certainly excited about Metroid Other M. I...

272
00:22:41,747 --> 00:22:46,010
[SPEAKER_06]: If it is mostly a 2D Metroid especially, I'm really excited.

273
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,291
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm cool with them throwing some 3D in there a la Paper Mario.

274
00:22:50,292 --> 00:22:56,035
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, it's not that Prime was bad, but it's just I love Super Metroid and can't wait to see a game like that.

275
00:22:56,135 --> 00:23:00,578
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm sure we'll see more details on this in the coming months because this game is going to be out now.

276
00:23:00,978 --> 00:23:01,839
[SPEAKER_06]: What, we're looking at March?

277
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:02,819
[SPEAKER_06]: This game's out in three months.

278
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:03,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

279
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Crazy.

280
00:23:07,216 --> 00:23:23,912
[SPEAKER_06]: and actually we're getting linked to something on YouTube I'm hoping this isn't a joke but it comes from Tiger Claw saying the Metroid Other M intro video was apparently leaked oh yeah somebody's got their little camera here at the press conference so Tiger Claw just linked this in our chat room

281
00:23:25,703 --> 00:23:31,987
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to see, and I apologize because I know video doesn't make for great radio, but okay, we see nebulas and clouds and all that stuff here.

282
00:23:32,007 --> 00:23:34,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me skip forward a little more in the video.

283
00:23:36,129 --> 00:23:42,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, whoever's holding their camera is having to hold it a little low, but we do see kind of like a rendered Samus in 3D.

284
00:23:42,633 --> 00:23:45,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, those graphics look really good, especially for the Wii.

285
00:23:46,713 --> 00:23:49,274
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Nintendo's hoping this will be the game that changes people's minds.

286
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:52,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there's the baby Metroid from the end of Super Metroid.

287
00:23:52,636 --> 00:23:53,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't it cute?

288
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:54,457
[SPEAKER_06]: And the mother brain.

289
00:23:55,057 --> 00:23:55,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.

290
00:23:56,138 --> 00:23:57,659
[SPEAKER_06]: That actually does look pretty impressive.

291
00:23:57,859 --> 00:24:00,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, remember how the boss shot the laser from her eye and everything?

292
00:24:01,581 --> 00:24:02,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

293
00:24:05,063 --> 00:24:06,083
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty cool.

294
00:24:07,064 --> 00:24:10,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, whoever leaked that little piece of footage is gonna get busted, but that's really awesome.

295
00:24:12,587 --> 00:24:13,007
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

296
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:19,296
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to check that out, the YouTube user that has this video posted right now is MetroidBlaster127.

297
00:24:19,676 --> 00:24:24,138
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where we got linked to by our chat room.

298
00:24:24,198 --> 00:24:28,160
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta say, maybe this will be the game that changes people's minds on the Wii.

299
00:24:28,661 --> 00:24:29,041
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

300
00:24:31,322 --> 00:24:37,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's not necessarily that my mind needs to be changed because Nintendo does put out that one or two awesome games a year.

301
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:42,408
[SPEAKER_02]: If this does well, let's see a Team Ninja Zelda game or a Team Ninja Mario game.

302
00:24:43,925 --> 00:24:44,245
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura

303
00:25:09,736 --> 00:25:12,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this is about the DSi XL.

304
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:14,880
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got a date and a price for it.

305
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,161
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like it's going to be out on March 28th.

306
00:25:17,261 --> 00:25:21,724
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be $190, and I'm pretty sure I don't know if I'm going to get one.

307
00:25:23,705 --> 00:25:27,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Aren't they saying that a new DS is kind of rumored for E3 this year?

308
00:25:27,588 --> 00:25:29,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that could be one of the things that they announce?

309
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:34,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's supposed to be one for $189.99.

310
00:25:34,773 --> 00:25:38,976
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to laugh if they do release a new one right after they do this.

311
00:25:39,856 --> 00:25:42,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I know we've gotten into this on the show before.

312
00:25:42,097 --> 00:25:44,558
[SPEAKER_06]: They did the micro after the DS was announced.

313
00:25:44,578 --> 00:25:45,018
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked my micro.

314
00:25:45,078 --> 00:25:47,599
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly don't think that they need to do another DS.

315
00:25:47,639 --> 00:25:54,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, granted, the XL, whatever, people might want a larger screen for something.

316
00:25:54,082 --> 00:25:54,542
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

317
00:25:54,562 --> 00:25:59,744
[SPEAKER_02]: They're kind of posing this as like a secondhand e-book reader or something like that.

318
00:25:59,764 --> 00:26:06,487
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I think one of the new pieces of software they're going to have with this is like some sort of classic novel collection or something like that.

319
00:26:06,768 --> 00:26:07,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I could be interesting.

320
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:08,757
[SPEAKER_09]: I would get that.

321
00:26:09,139 --> 00:26:10,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Then again, I use my Kindle.

322
00:26:10,427 --> 00:26:11,588
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't this game.

323
00:26:11,628 --> 00:26:17,533
[SPEAKER_02]: There was actually a... Or it wasn't the DSi XL that was necessarily kind of cool.

324
00:26:17,633 --> 00:26:30,004
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a... I want to say it's a new DSiWare game that's going to be coming out where it's like a hidden pictures game that you have to search for different letters in this scene.

325
00:26:30,544 --> 00:26:35,048
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's kind of cool about it though is they almost do a pseudo head tracking with it using the camera.

326
00:26:35,388 --> 00:26:38,511
[SPEAKER_02]: You actually tilt the system around and the camera changes angles

327
00:26:39,151 --> 00:27:00,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Based on how you have the system tilted Why don't they do this technology with DSi That might make it a lot cooler With different games coming out That you have this neat little Head tracking technology built in That would be really cool And kind of a way to differentiate Themselves with DSi Because right now it's like It's a DS with a camera They don't like to give us what we want

328
00:27:01,826 --> 00:27:04,329
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, another big problem with this is the price.

329
00:27:04,649 --> 00:27:06,471
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, $200, right?

330
00:27:06,511 --> 00:27:07,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Or $190 or whatever it is.

331
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:13,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Something like that is supposed to be like $20 more than what the DSi is now.

332
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's stupid.

333
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:18,845
[SPEAKER_06]: But now you're also talking you could get a Wii for the same price, right?

334
00:27:18,885 --> 00:27:20,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Or at least an Xbox 360 low-end, right?

335
00:27:20,427 --> 00:27:20,567
[SPEAKER_06]: For $199.

336
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,812
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't know.

337
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:27,795
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not really sold on, again, why I need the DSi XL.

338
00:27:28,176 --> 00:27:29,277
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a DSi.

339
00:27:29,617 --> 00:27:30,118
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have one.

340
00:27:30,158 --> 00:27:32,621
[SPEAKER_06]: I have the DS Lite, was the last Nintendo system I bought.

341
00:27:33,422 --> 00:27:39,308
[SPEAKER_06]: And I probably wouldn't have even bought that if I hadn't kind of bought it as like a knee-jerk thing when I was on vacation once.

342
00:27:39,469 --> 00:27:39,609
[SPEAKER_06]: This...

343
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:41,130
[SPEAKER_06]: I would still have my DS fat.

344
00:28:08,232 --> 00:28:09,473
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't understand the point of this.

345
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:43,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, maybe they're in pretty colors, because that would be a big seller, as if they're in fabulous pink and sexy lavender.

346
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:50,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know what the colors are going to be, but I think from what we've seen in the pictures, it's like they have a wine burgundy color.

347
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:52,061
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and another one's bronze.

348
00:28:53,002 --> 00:28:53,743
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd get a bronze one.

349
00:28:54,905 --> 00:28:55,025
[SPEAKER_06]: It's...

350
00:28:56,614 --> 00:29:01,956
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so like a third place looking color and then a Franzia looking color.

351
00:29:03,196 --> 00:29:09,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, if you want a DSi in a specific color, there are websites out there that will give you a DSi in any color you want.

352
00:29:09,598 --> 00:29:13,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can go to Nintendo World Store in New York and they'll give you a DSi color.

353
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,560
[SPEAKER_06]: I almost did that.

354
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:21,782
[SPEAKER_06]: They had like the custom DS cases and really there was a sexy metallic green one I kind of wanted but I resisted.

355
00:29:21,822 --> 00:29:22,382
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't buy it.

356
00:29:23,408 --> 00:29:52,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Almost As you should have because you probably already have a DS And there's no reason to purchase something because of the color There really wasn't Except the fact that it was one of the lights And I didn't have a light at that time So I almost bought that I did buy my Now I can't remember which letter is attached to it My pink one Because it was pink I do feel a little And I wanted to be different than what people expect

357
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Mine are very generic.

358
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,361
[SPEAKER_06]: My DS fat is gray and my DS light is black.

359
00:29:56,481 --> 00:29:58,102
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not my DS, my old SP.

360
00:29:58,342 --> 00:29:59,582
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not the SP, the one before that.

361
00:29:59,682 --> 00:30:02,543
[SPEAKER_06]: But I feel a little ridiculous having both of them at this point.

362
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:05,083
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I just need to sell one of these, but who'd buy it?

363
00:30:05,944 --> 00:30:06,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Do what we do.

364
00:30:07,384 --> 00:30:08,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Get another room.

365
00:30:09,645 --> 00:30:10,685
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have another room.

366
00:30:10,705 --> 00:30:11,265
[SPEAKER_06]: I just moved.

367
00:30:11,305 --> 00:30:12,105
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to downsize.

368
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:13,606
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have as much room as I had before.

369
00:30:14,026 --> 00:30:15,426
[SPEAKER_06]: I got boxes everywhere still.

370
00:30:16,186 --> 00:30:17,147
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to get rid of things.

371
00:30:17,847 --> 00:30:18,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Take my DS to the dump.

372
00:30:20,168 --> 00:30:21,808
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's move on with some more news.

373
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:26,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so some other interesting stuff that came out of the Media Summit.

374
00:30:26,428 --> 00:30:35,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo will be publishing Dragon Quest IX in North America, which is kind of weird if you think about it because Square Enix is over here.

375
00:30:35,171 --> 00:30:36,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Why aren't they publishing the game?

376
00:30:37,672 --> 00:30:54,214
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it's coming out over here sometime in the summer and you know with Nintendo being the one that's publishing the game hopefully there'll be a better marketing campaign behind it so maybe that's good and because people buy blindly whatever Nintendo puts out so that's always good

377
00:30:56,235 --> 00:31:21,525
[SPEAKER_02]: another game scheduled for May coming to the DS would be Picross 3D and kind of a cool looking game and of course you know Picross is kind of a puzzle game where you make a picture well now it's going to be in three dimensions as well and you'll break apart cubes to reveal different little cube animals and objects and stuff so that's kind of neat um

378
00:31:22,725 --> 00:31:23,285
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

379
00:31:45,811 --> 00:31:46,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Not in America, no, that's true.

380
00:31:47,733 --> 00:31:49,194
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks pretty cool.

381
00:31:49,234 --> 00:31:51,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of reminded me of some Panzer Dragon stuff on there.

382
00:31:53,977 --> 00:31:55,158
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, WiiWare.

383
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:03,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Right around the corner, actually, Cave Story will be making its way out on WiiWare March 22nd with slightly upgraded graphics.

384
00:32:04,585 --> 00:32:06,627
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks kind of neat.

385
00:32:06,747 --> 00:32:14,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, there's going to be some download content as well being available, including a new Boss Rush and Sanctuary Time Attack mode.

386
00:32:15,253 --> 00:32:17,074
[SPEAKER_02]: That will be available to download.

387
00:32:20,175 --> 00:32:20,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh.

388
00:32:20,915 --> 00:32:22,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I guess I take that back.

389
00:32:23,456 --> 00:32:24,096
[SPEAKER_02]: I misread that.

390
00:32:24,736 --> 00:32:27,197
[SPEAKER_02]: It was originally announced as download content, but now it's being included.

391
00:32:28,037 --> 00:32:28,918
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you get it for free.

392
00:32:30,718 --> 00:32:32,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, extra stuff for free is always good.

393
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:33,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.

394
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:39,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Any news that particularly got you excited at the Nintendo conference?

395
00:32:39,061 --> 00:32:40,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we've kind of touched on most of the stuff.

396
00:32:41,922 --> 00:32:42,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

397
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:54,634
[SPEAKER_02]: There was some other interesting stuff, like regarding Monster Hunter Tri, or I guess they're calling it Monster Hunter Tri or whatever.

398
00:32:56,295 --> 00:32:57,876
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll talk a little bit more about that later.

399
00:32:58,136 --> 00:32:59,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.

400
00:33:00,577 --> 00:33:07,421
[SPEAKER_02]: I was very interested to see that both Mario Galaxy and Metroid Other M are coming out in the second quarter, which...

401
00:33:08,993 --> 00:33:09,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

402
00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:20,540
[SPEAKER_06]: New Zelda, OMG!

403
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:49,705
[SPEAKER_06]: and last year's E3 they came out within five minutes they were on New Super Mario Bros.

404
00:33:49,745 --> 00:33:52,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii and they're like hey it's a New Super Mario Bros.

405
00:33:52,588 --> 00:33:59,236
[SPEAKER_06]: game that looks and kind of plays like the old school one and this is what gamers want da da da and guess what it's out this holiday woohoo

406
00:33:59,676 --> 00:34:01,417
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was one of the big things they showed on the floor.

407
00:34:01,797 --> 00:34:10,119
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm thinking there could be another, like, gotcha this year from Nintendo, except I worry it might be the Zelda game that's already kind of leaked out.

408
00:34:10,259 --> 00:34:13,740
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm guessing it's going to be like a Pikmin 3, probably the new Zelda game.

409
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:21,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Wii Relax, which will be retarded, but it'll probably come out around October-ish, I think around the same time as Wii Fit Plus did this year.

410
00:34:21,323 --> 00:34:23,223
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they'll probably treat it as... Oh, the Vitality?

411
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:27,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think they'll probably treat it as much, you know, like the Wii Fit Plus.

412
00:34:27,805 --> 00:34:28,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a lot of... I mean...

413
00:34:29,605 --> 00:34:34,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not going to do as well as we fit in general.

414
00:34:35,748 --> 00:34:40,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't see the need for that little vitality sensor, but whatever.

415
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:47,734
[SPEAKER_02]: What would be really cool though is to do a new Zelda game, but new Super Mario Bros.

416
00:34:47,774 --> 00:34:52,216
[SPEAKER_02]: style where it's old school Zelda, but four player and teaming up.

417
00:34:52,236 --> 00:34:53,077
[SPEAKER_02]: So the four swords.

418
00:34:53,597 --> 00:34:54,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that, yeah.

419
00:34:54,837 --> 00:34:56,018
[SPEAKER_11]: I want a lethargy sensor.

420
00:34:57,321 --> 00:34:59,743
[SPEAKER_06]: How about a Wii Vitality Sensor that shocks you?

421
00:35:00,584 --> 00:35:01,224
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not moving!

422
00:35:01,324 --> 00:35:02,465
[SPEAKER_11]: Clear!

423
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:08,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Or just something like when you screw up in the game, it gives you a little bite with electricity or something.

424
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:09,170
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

425
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:10,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Could be fun.

426
00:35:10,571 --> 00:35:12,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe a new WarioWare game.

427
00:35:13,113 --> 00:35:17,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Or the fanboy in me would love to see an F-Zero game come out of nowhere.

428
00:35:17,356 --> 00:35:21,359
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to hold my breath though, but that would be the whoa crap game.

429
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,481
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still holding out for an Excite Truck

430
00:35:24,925 --> 00:35:27,809
[SPEAKER_02]: A real Excite Truck 2, not this Excite Bots bullshit.

431
00:35:29,872 --> 00:35:30,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

432
00:35:30,393 --> 00:35:31,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything's possible.

433
00:35:31,721 --> 00:35:33,442
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, let's move on to some other platforms.

434
00:35:33,502 --> 00:35:43,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, a big game going on right now is Heavy Rain on the PlayStation 3, which sadly I have not gotten my hands on yet amongst all my real-life stuff going on, but I do want to play it at some point.

435
00:35:43,228 --> 00:35:52,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I heard, and this is kind of like breaking news as we're taping live on this Sunday, I heard something about PlayStation Network is down right now, I guess, and if you want to play Heavy Rain, you can't.

436
00:35:52,995 --> 00:35:54,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I don't know how that works.

437
00:35:54,716 --> 00:35:57,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Does the game talk to the servers somehow?

438
00:35:57,278 --> 00:35:58,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you have to be online?

439
00:35:58,198 --> 00:35:58,839
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see how it could.

440
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:05,267
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see how it could because, you know, what if you don't have an internet connection and you can't play the game?

441
00:36:07,474 --> 00:36:31,702
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, apparently something was going on I guess there's some game crashing errors going on on the PSN and it has something to do with the dates reverting and now some of the data is corrupting or something and yeah, the issues are preventing folks from launching games like Heavy Rain so it sounds like the date or something might have got screwed up and now it's messing everyone up I wonder how that works Yikes Hopefully that's fixed soon

442
00:36:33,183 --> 00:36:36,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Heavy Rain was banned in another country this week.

443
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:37,585
[SPEAKER_06]: United Arab Emirates.

444
00:36:38,006 --> 00:36:39,647
[SPEAKER_06]: You will not be able to play Heavy Rain.

445
00:36:39,707 --> 00:36:40,727
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an official ban there.

446
00:36:41,628 --> 00:36:50,753
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you are in the Middle East and you want to play this game, you're going to have to import it or something because the game was banned by the country's National Media Council.

447
00:36:51,133 --> 00:36:55,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, Sony has come out and said, you know, the game is an 18 plus game.

448
00:36:55,416 --> 00:37:00,419
[SPEAKER_06]: It is strong content, but they didn't really respond to this particular ban.

449
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:09,045
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have a feeling they might just cut their losses since, unfortunately, for anybody listening who might be in the UAE, it's not one of Sony's biggest markets.

450
00:37:09,205 --> 00:37:12,027
[SPEAKER_06]: So they might just be cutting their losses and hoping you guys will import it.

451
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:12,527
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

452
00:37:13,628 --> 00:37:16,349
[SPEAKER_06]: But it wasn't banned because of the bugs.

453
00:37:16,409 --> 00:37:19,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, there's some bugs going on in Heavy Rain.

454
00:37:19,211 --> 00:37:20,892
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to do with just some technical things.

455
00:37:21,253 --> 00:37:22,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Some audio is out of sync.

456
00:37:23,714 --> 00:37:25,095
[SPEAKER_06]: The game is freezing up.

457
00:37:25,275 --> 00:37:28,337
[SPEAKER_06]: There are some auto-saves that turn out they can't load.

458
00:37:28,598 --> 00:37:30,359
[SPEAKER_06]: And for some reason, everybody's speaking French.

459
00:37:31,459 --> 00:37:33,040
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kidding about the last one, sort of.

460
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:39,961
[SPEAKER_06]: But the rest is all... Well, you've heard about how Heavy Rain was made in France and was developed by a French studio.

461
00:37:40,282 --> 00:37:45,163
[SPEAKER_06]: So they have all these French voice actors, but they're doing English and apparently the accent is really noticeable.

462
00:37:45,183 --> 00:37:46,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Really noticeable.

463
00:37:46,883 --> 00:37:55,966
[SPEAKER_02]: The PlayStation Network actually got hacked because on their website there is a directory called Dear PlayStation that says get Flash and or enable JavaScript and stop wasting my time.

464
00:37:58,274 --> 00:37:58,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

465
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:01,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Yikes.

466
00:38:01,635 --> 00:38:04,597
[SPEAKER_06]: So PSN might be the victim of a hack going on right now.

467
00:38:06,297 --> 00:38:08,278
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, the game is locking up and so forth.

468
00:38:08,438 --> 00:38:14,380
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess Sony has kind of posted in their forums about it saying that they are aware of some of the issues.

469
00:38:14,761 --> 00:38:22,624
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're having a particular issue, you should go to the thread and post your information because this is the era of patching video games that are already broken.

470
00:38:23,664 --> 00:38:47,977
[SPEAKER_06]: isn't Sony the same service that's running a show right now about finding a video game tester I'm going to talk about this more in part B yes Sony might need some more video game testers right now so maybe you all win yeah maybe everybody needs to win that show and go test Heavy Rain I don't know I will talk more about the tester in part B I have a lot of thoughts on that so we'll get into that a little later on in the program but for now more gaming news from DarkSakura and then the release dates in a little bit

471
00:38:49,023 --> 00:38:50,104
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, release dates.

472
00:38:50,364 --> 00:38:51,125
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking forward.

473
00:38:52,085 --> 00:38:55,328
[SPEAKER_09]: But instead of that, this is not something that anyone should be looking forward to.

474
00:38:55,388 --> 00:38:56,689
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty bad.

475
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:05,175
[SPEAKER_09]: There are 12 game stores, as in a big retailer in the UK.

476
00:39:05,595 --> 00:39:11,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, more than that, 43 are going to be closing down in the UK.

477
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:14,941
[SPEAKER_09]: That means that 247 people are going to be laid off.

478
00:39:16,162 --> 00:39:21,746
[SPEAKER_09]: or, as the article says, will be redundant, which I think is a horrible term.

479
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:27,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Also... Well, that's what they call it over there, though, redundancies, right?

480
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:27,490
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

481
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:30,132
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think it's just a terrible word.

482
00:39:31,332 --> 00:39:32,593
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, hi, you're redundant.

483
00:39:33,254 --> 00:39:34,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

484
00:39:35,535 --> 00:39:38,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Whose fault is that for creating a redundant position?

485
00:39:38,357 --> 00:39:39,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

486
00:39:39,898 --> 00:39:41,699
[SPEAKER_06]: The same guy who's probably laying me off.

487
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:45,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's going to be a third of the stores out of a total of 682.

488
00:39:45,982 --> 00:39:56,729
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's including 12 game stores and 6 game station outlets and 25 Debenhams stores, the little concessions.

489
00:39:57,062 --> 00:39:58,142
[SPEAKER_06]: GameStop GameCrazy GameCrazy

490
00:40:25,032 --> 00:40:26,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't get me started on that, please.

491
00:40:26,273 --> 00:40:29,796
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I'm sorry, but, you know, it's... A bunch of GameStops closed?

492
00:40:29,916 --> 00:40:36,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, then there would be an adequate number of GameStops available, because right now there's way too many.

493
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they're totally cornering the market, which I think is disgusting.

494
00:40:39,483 --> 00:40:41,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't we have antitrust laws and stuff?

495
00:40:41,384 --> 00:40:42,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we do, but Google's not listening.

496
00:40:42,905 --> 00:40:44,427
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, GameStop's not listening.

497
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:45,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I say Google?

498
00:40:46,148 --> 00:40:46,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you said Google.

499
00:40:46,748 --> 00:40:47,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, Google's on the list, too.

500
00:40:47,809 --> 00:40:48,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Google's always listening.

501
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:54,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, Google's just been on a decline in the past couple years.

502
00:40:54,389 --> 00:40:56,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Google's being sued for violation of antitrust.

503
00:40:57,011 --> 00:40:59,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm a big Google fan, but I'm sorry.

504
00:40:59,972 --> 00:41:01,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Wave was what?

505
00:41:01,733 --> 00:41:03,454
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't need Google Mars.

506
00:41:03,674 --> 00:41:04,295
[SPEAKER_06]: And Buzz?

507
00:41:04,515 --> 00:41:05,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you know about that?

508
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:06,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Google Mars?

509
00:41:06,316 --> 00:41:07,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Google Mars.

510
00:41:07,276 --> 00:41:08,617
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the maps on Mars, right?

511
00:41:08,637 --> 00:41:08,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

512
00:41:08,877 --> 00:41:09,678
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's cool.

513
00:41:10,138 --> 00:41:11,779
[SPEAKER_10]: It's cool, but it doesn't look very good.

514
00:41:11,859 --> 00:41:15,401
[SPEAKER_10]: And why do we need to... Can't we just go to NASA's website or something?

515
00:41:15,901 --> 00:41:16,081
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm okay.

516
00:41:16,161 --> 00:41:17,101
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm okay with Google Mars.

517
00:41:17,442 --> 00:41:21,544
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's Earth in the style, but it's Mars in the style of Google Earth.

518
00:41:21,564 --> 00:41:21,964
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm okay with that.

519
00:41:21,984 --> 00:41:22,904
[SPEAKER_08]: What about Google Veronica Mars?

520
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Buzz!

521
00:41:24,205 --> 00:41:25,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Google Veronica Mars would be cool.

522
00:41:25,966 --> 00:41:27,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Buzz was bad.

523
00:41:28,707 --> 00:41:30,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Buzz was a bad idea.

524
00:41:30,668 --> 00:41:31,308
[SPEAKER_06]: What was Buzz?

525
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:31,969
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't hear about that.

526
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:45,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Buzz was their response to Twitter, but the problem was it automatically added the, like, 40 most common people you email to your Buzz friends list, and if somebody went to your public profile, they could see the 40 people you email the most.

527
00:41:45,715 --> 00:41:53,982
[SPEAKER_06]: So if one of them happens to be like an ex or, you know, a boss is emailing his secretary on a personal email, everybody can see that.

528
00:41:54,002 --> 00:41:54,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Or a porn finder.

529
00:41:54,903 --> 00:41:55,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

530
00:41:55,563 --> 00:42:01,568
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, whoever thought that was a good idea needs to be made redundant.

531
00:42:02,609 --> 00:42:03,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly.

532
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:06,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if they were going to do something like that, they should have it as an option that you could select.

533
00:42:06,852 --> 00:42:08,253
[SPEAKER_09]: It's ridiculous.

534
00:42:08,373 --> 00:42:12,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, now they backtracked, but they botched the launch of that thing, and now nobody's going to trust it.

535
00:42:12,815 --> 00:42:17,218
[SPEAKER_06]: So they might as well just nuke, nuke Buzz, nuke Wave, and start again.

536
00:42:17,398 --> 00:42:17,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Google BuzzWave.

537
00:42:17,979 --> 00:42:20,140
[SPEAKER_09]: I am sick of the social networking, by the way.

538
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,441
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like I was posting on my Facebook earlier.

539
00:42:22,881 --> 00:42:25,323
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sick of social networking, yet I'm compelled to still do it.

540
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:28,347
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

541
00:42:42,245 --> 00:42:43,526
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

542
00:43:09,523 --> 00:43:10,523
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just ridiculous.

543
00:43:10,563 --> 00:43:13,384
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just thinking like, okay, I get what they're trying to do.

544
00:43:13,884 --> 00:43:21,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Like here at OLR, we try to embrace all social networking when it comes out because we want to be where every gamer has a voice and we want people to interact with us.

545
00:43:21,926 --> 00:43:25,487
[SPEAKER_06]: And I get that Bizarre is trying to be on the cutting edge.

546
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:27,427
[SPEAKER_06]: So for that, I say, okay, cool.

547
00:43:27,747 --> 00:43:31,608
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's the other part of me that goes, God, as if Twitter didn't have enough bullshit on it already.

548
00:43:32,148 --> 00:43:35,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, honestly, guys, I'm just straight up with this whole social networking thing.

549
00:43:35,491 --> 00:43:36,271
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've told people this.

550
00:43:36,811 --> 00:43:49,280
[SPEAKER_06]: If you post important news about your life on Facebook and are going to give me a pop quiz on it later or expect me to know that, like, you are getting engaged because the only place you said anything was Facebook, I'm sorry.

551
00:43:49,781 --> 00:43:50,702
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't fly with me.

552
00:43:51,122 --> 00:43:55,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, if you want me to know what's going on with you, text, email.

553
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:57,927
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I like to think those are kind of modern things.

554
00:43:58,067 --> 00:43:58,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Or call.

555
00:43:58,967 --> 00:44:00,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Pick up the phone, dial the numbers, and call.

556
00:44:01,485 --> 00:44:02,165
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

557
00:44:02,225 --> 00:44:03,366
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to read this list.

558
00:44:03,927 --> 00:44:06,168
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a poster that was done by The Oatmeal.

559
00:44:07,449 --> 00:44:09,290
[SPEAKER_09]: The 10 things you need to stop tweeting about.

560
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:10,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you seen that, Rob?

561
00:44:11,431 --> 00:44:11,971
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I have not.

562
00:44:12,452 --> 00:44:13,552
[SPEAKER_09]: One, what are you eating?

563
00:44:13,793 --> 00:44:15,093
[SPEAKER_09]: I had meatloaf for breakfast.

564
00:44:15,253 --> 00:44:15,894
[SPEAKER_09]: LOL, please, RT.

565
00:44:17,828 --> 00:44:33,765
[SPEAKER_09]: social media the conference or event that you're at Twitter itself well now wait a minute though because Twitter like we did the tweet thing from E3 and I think a lot of people like that because we post pictures on the floor that was reporting news this example is using it's like

566
00:44:36,154 --> 00:44:57,253
[SPEAKER_06]: So and so totally owned that last session on optimizing your Twitter background pic I get what you're saying You know what, there's a girl on my friends list And I love her to death I think she's amazing But she posts so many updates Whenever she's at like a concert for a former American Idol or something Like it just fills up my page And I can't see anybody else's list And I'm kind of just thinking like

567
00:44:58,374 --> 00:44:59,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you post a live journal?

568
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Or somewhere where you can make long posts?

569
00:45:01,455 --> 00:45:05,356
[SPEAKER_09]: The other one on here is your workout, your kid, dog, cat, goat, or whatever else.

570
00:45:05,997 --> 00:45:08,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking out of context, as in people who just say nonsense.

571
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Daily booth photos, emotional breakthroughs.

572
00:45:11,659 --> 00:45:12,859
[SPEAKER_09]: What's a daily booth photo?

573
00:45:13,219 --> 00:45:15,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Like posting the daily picture of yourself.

574
00:45:16,491 --> 00:45:19,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, like where it's the same picture of me every day, flexing and looking cute?

575
00:45:19,315 --> 00:45:19,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, okay.

576
00:45:19,796 --> 00:45:21,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Emotional breakthroughs in the number of followers you have.

577
00:45:22,439 --> 00:45:23,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

578
00:45:24,241 --> 00:45:27,806
[SPEAKER_06]: That's so tacky when somebody posts like, I have a thousand followers.

579
00:45:28,587 --> 00:45:29,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'll have to tell you.

580
00:45:29,528 --> 00:45:30,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you don't.

581
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:31,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you have 999.

582
00:45:31,471 --> 00:45:31,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Click.

583
00:45:32,935 --> 00:45:35,617
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to tell you what hit me today.

584
00:45:35,697 --> 00:45:40,579
[SPEAKER_09]: And I actually use Twitter now for more of professional networking.

585
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,301
[SPEAKER_09]: I follow a lot of other designers.

586
00:45:43,561 --> 00:45:45,262
[SPEAKER_09]: I follow people in the comic book industry.

587
00:45:45,402 --> 00:45:51,485
[SPEAKER_09]: And I actually get something out of... And yeah, it's not that I don't care about the people on Twitter.

588
00:45:52,286 --> 00:45:52,786
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

589
00:45:53,366 --> 00:45:56,248
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just that I really don't need to know how big of a poop you took.

590
00:45:58,109 --> 00:46:01,191
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure your baby is cute, but I would rather have something meaningful.

591
00:46:02,153 --> 00:46:28,639
[SPEAKER_06]: I honestly I feel like the biggest hypocrite when it comes to Twitter because most of the stuff I tweet these days have to do with video games and I kind of use it like for OLR related things and to keep tabs on the OLR fans but I don't like reading that stuff like when I look at my fans list and it's like a bunch of other podcasters promoting their shows I'm like yeah okay I know you have a show I get it but as in here I am tweeting hey listen to OLR tonight you know well it's just Twitter makes me feel dirty

592
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:34,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's why I say, you know, we have problems with it, yet we feel compelled to use it, right?

593
00:46:34,569 --> 00:46:37,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it is now a part of our culture.

594
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,684
[SPEAKER_09]: If you think about it, it's really a great... Which is why it's not cool anymore.

595
00:46:44,325 --> 00:46:49,250
[SPEAKER_09]: In Facebook, I have a little bit more love for because I use that as my mini blog.

596
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:55,555
[SPEAKER_09]: That's actually, I go back and check on it because I usually just put my to-do list up there, like what do I need to get done today and refer back to it.

597
00:46:55,976 --> 00:47:04,284
[SPEAKER_09]: But I've actually not even been, you know, I'm actually making a conscious effort not to use either of them so much and actually keep a notebook with me and use my live journal and my blog.

598
00:47:04,904 --> 00:47:12,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the thing that freaks me out is that CNN uses Twitter as a real source now, and that kind of weirds me out a little bit.

599
00:47:12,707 --> 00:47:15,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when Boner died this week, right?

600
00:47:15,648 --> 00:47:18,729
[SPEAKER_06]: The celebrity from... He was Boner on Growing Pain.

601
00:47:18,789 --> 00:47:19,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Chekhov's kid.

602
00:47:19,909 --> 00:47:20,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, oh yeah, Chekhov's kid.

603
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:25,231
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, unfortunately, very tragic, sad, you know, what have you.

604
00:47:25,431 --> 00:47:29,733
[SPEAKER_06]: But CNN went to Twitter to see what all the other celebrities...

605
00:47:30,433 --> 00:47:31,574
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

606
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:51,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

607
00:48:12,682 --> 00:48:12,982
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

608
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this is my thought.

609
00:48:15,003 --> 00:48:16,624
[SPEAKER_06]: I can use Google and Twitter.

610
00:48:16,864 --> 00:48:23,007
[SPEAKER_09]: When they're doing editorials and want to get viewer feedback, that's a good thing.

611
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:25,108
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the same reason why we have the chat room.

612
00:48:25,789 --> 00:48:31,251
[SPEAKER_09]: When we talk about an actual story and we want to see what people think about it, I think look at it as that equivalent.

613
00:48:32,212 --> 00:48:34,613
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's a fine line.

614
00:48:34,653 --> 00:48:36,154
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a really fine line.

615
00:48:37,394 --> 00:48:39,916
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that's why I think there's legitimate uses for it.

616
00:48:40,016 --> 00:48:43,338
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, you know, a lot of people honestly are using it to validate themselves.

617
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:49,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas, you know, if you want to share something important with people, it's a good way to do it.

618
00:48:49,922 --> 00:48:55,185
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to see what other people are doing in your industry, it's a good thing to find out other people that are in your industry.

619
00:48:55,605 --> 00:49:00,708
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm really just getting like so tired of the, oh, I had to poop today.

620
00:49:02,149 --> 00:49:06,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, nobody's going to retweet you and then say, I'm so glad your colon is working properly.

621
00:49:07,093 --> 00:49:08,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Some people do reply to that.

622
00:49:09,915 --> 00:49:10,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't get me started.

623
00:49:11,497 --> 00:49:18,862
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, I post really inane stuff on there too, but I actually just detached my loud Twitter feed from my live journal.

624
00:49:20,844 --> 00:49:24,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

625
00:49:24,126 --> 00:49:27,369
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the thing I hate most about Twitter is that it's invading live journal.

626
00:49:27,409 --> 00:49:27,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

627
00:49:27,909 --> 00:49:29,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Gold star for Jamie, I'm so happy.

628
00:49:30,271 --> 00:49:35,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Over the last few weeks, I would just go back and check my loud Twitter feed and I posted one thing.

629
00:49:37,233 --> 00:49:37,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

630
00:49:39,274 --> 00:49:40,875
[SPEAKER_09]: I just now do it to keep up with other people.

631
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:49,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Or if I have something to announce that's important, like, come to my birthday party, or I'm going to be going to LA, I would like to meet up with my friends there.

632
00:49:50,058 --> 00:49:50,698
[SPEAKER_09]: That type of thing.

633
00:49:51,558 --> 00:49:56,780
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a little bit more reasonable instead of, oh, I had some Weetabix for breakfast.

634
00:49:58,211 --> 00:49:58,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

635
00:49:58,952 --> 00:50:08,137
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we're on this big tangent with social networking, but we're in a weird place right now where it's kind of like the honeymoon phase is over with the Twitter and the Facebook and now it's like, okay, I'm over it.

636
00:50:10,362 --> 00:50:16,166
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have some thoughts, why not email them to us, mailbag at orangelandradio.com, or we'll probably get some phone calls on it later in the show.

637
00:50:16,666 --> 00:50:21,490
[SPEAKER_06]: For now, though, we want to get to the classic game of the week, but not before we do release dates and a couple more news stories.

638
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:24,652
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's travel around the world and see what's coming out in the various countries.

639
00:50:24,732 --> 00:50:24,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

640
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, this week there's actually some pretty good stuff coming out.

641
00:50:28,575 --> 00:50:32,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Sins of a Solar Empire, Trinity, actually, coming out this week as well.

642
00:50:33,538 --> 00:50:38,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Dante's Inferno making its way out on PSP was a little delayed from the other games by almost a month.

643
00:50:39,582 --> 00:50:49,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Alice in Wonderland, they have that coming out in DS and on the Wii, the Wii version being more like the movie, the DS version being more like Beetlejuice the cartoon.

644
00:50:50,189 --> 00:50:51,710
[SPEAKER_02]: At least that's what it looks like in the picture.

645
00:50:53,791 --> 00:50:58,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Lunar Silver Star Harmony Limited Edition coming out on PSP.

646
00:51:00,215 --> 00:51:26,465
[SPEAKER_02]: DECA Sports on the DS this week SpongeBob's Boating Bash coming out on the Nintendo DS and on the Wii kind of a demolition derby type of game MLB 2K10 coming out on PlayStation 2, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and PSP Also coming out from Sony, MLB 10 The Show, which is on all Sony platforms, PS2, PS3, and PSP

647
00:51:29,591 --> 00:51:34,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Battle of Giants, Mutant Insects, Battlefield Bad Company 2, Silent Hunter 5, Battle of the Atlantic,

648
00:51:49,364 --> 00:52:02,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Supreme Commander 2 coming out from Square Enix on PC as well and Lips Party Classics coming out on Xbox 360 and that is it.

649
00:52:02,831 --> 00:52:07,493
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw a new commercial for Lips this week that I guess uses Lily Allen sort of as the centerpiece of it.

650
00:52:08,374 --> 00:52:08,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Eh.

651
00:52:09,655 --> 00:52:10,435
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't that impressed.

652
00:52:12,762 --> 00:52:14,643
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I guess maybe I'm just more of a SingStar fan.

653
00:52:14,683 --> 00:52:16,803
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised anybody buys Lips, to be honest.

654
00:52:17,144 --> 00:52:23,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I buy SingStar, I mean... Yeah, but I understand SingStar because there's an actual following for that, but Lips is not so much.

655
00:52:24,326 --> 00:52:25,907
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like they're trying, they keep putting games out.

656
00:52:25,927 --> 00:52:28,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think Lips was kind of put out as a response to SingStar.

657
00:52:28,988 --> 00:52:32,889
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if Lips had come first, I probably would have been on the Lips bandwagon.

658
00:52:32,909 --> 00:52:35,310
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just SingStar seems to be easier to use, I guess.

659
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:37,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, SingStar also has the real... Well, I guess Lips does too.

660
00:52:38,011 --> 00:52:38,331
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

661
00:52:38,551 --> 00:52:41,692
[SPEAKER_06]: I know SingStar just has all the real videos integrated.

662
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:43,052
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a really great party game.

663
00:52:43,232 --> 00:52:43,752
[SPEAKER_02]: It does too.

664
00:52:44,012 --> 00:52:51,534
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thing I thought with Lips was it was supposed to be able to integrate any music that you had and kind of turn it into a karaoke version.

665
00:52:52,555 --> 00:52:53,175
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it does.

666
00:52:53,235 --> 00:52:54,055
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just kind of wonky.

667
00:52:54,375 --> 00:52:56,996
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the greatest implementation.

668
00:52:57,497 --> 00:52:58,777
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically using one of those.

669
00:52:59,137 --> 00:53:04,080
[SPEAKER_06]: You can use a filter in Adobe Audition to take out vocals too, but it's a little hit and miss.

670
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:09,222
[SPEAKER_06]: There's even some MP3 plugins that do that for Winamp, but it's a little hit and miss because it's just looking.

671
00:53:09,843 --> 00:53:16,726
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how the science of it works, but it looks at a certain component of the track of the song and kind of removes it, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.

672
00:53:18,481 --> 00:53:38,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, moving on to the Xbox 360 in Japan and looking at Japanese release dates Bioshock 2 comes out this week on March 4th as well as Nobunaga no Yabutendo comes out and I believe that was on the PS3 a couple weeks ago because I seem to remember talking about that game before but yeah, localized version of Bioshock 2 also on the 360 this week in Japan

673
00:53:38,767 --> 00:53:39,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on to the PlayStation 3.

674
00:53:41,169 --> 00:53:44,991
[SPEAKER_06]: No, there's Nobunaga no Yabutendo again, so maybe it was pushed back a little, I don't know.

675
00:53:45,351 --> 00:53:49,333
[SPEAKER_06]: But there it is on the PlayStation 3, also Bioshock 2 on the PlayStation 3 as well.

676
00:53:50,254 --> 00:53:51,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe this is actually, you know what this is?

677
00:53:52,215 --> 00:53:52,975
[SPEAKER_06]: No, this is different.

678
00:53:52,995 --> 00:53:56,597
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not the Dynasty Warriors, this actually looks like Nobunaga's Ambition.

679
00:53:56,637 --> 00:53:58,878
[SPEAKER_06]: This looks like a next-gen version of it.

680
00:53:58,918 --> 00:54:05,082
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I can't read the Japanese, but just looking at the interface, it looks like they're picking the different city layouts and so forth.

681
00:54:05,482 --> 00:54:12,109
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you know the Nobunaga Ambition series of games, I don't know how to explain it in a nutshell.

682
00:54:12,209 --> 00:54:19,356
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically an RTS-ish kind of game that's about Japanese feudalism, I guess is the easiest way for me to sum it up.

683
00:54:19,376 --> 00:54:20,697
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a feudal Japan sim.

684
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:25,622
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked the old school one on the NES, but boy that game's evolved quickly over time.

685
00:54:25,642 --> 00:54:27,604
[SPEAKER_02]: I had one on PlayStation 2 a few years back.

686
00:54:28,911 --> 00:54:30,852
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the last one I remembered that came out over here.

687
00:54:31,133 --> 00:54:31,853
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a new one coming out.

688
00:54:32,354 --> 00:54:34,795
[SPEAKER_06]: On the Nintendo Wii, nothing this week, believe it or not.

689
00:54:34,835 --> 00:54:36,477
[SPEAKER_06]: But next week, Taiko no Tatsujin.

690
00:54:36,497 --> 00:54:38,558
[SPEAKER_06]: I know our music game fans might be familiar with that one.

691
00:54:38,878 --> 00:54:41,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Taiko no Tatsujin makes its way to the Wii next week.

692
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:42,361
[SPEAKER_06]: That's March 11th, not this week.

693
00:54:42,381 --> 00:54:43,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that another one?

694
00:54:43,222 --> 00:54:43,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a sequel?

695
00:54:43,782 --> 00:54:45,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I thought they had one over there already.

696
00:54:45,483 --> 00:54:50,127
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought they had one there already too, but this must be... Is this the one with the inflatable drum?

697
00:54:50,147 --> 00:54:51,368
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it is.

698
00:54:51,928 --> 00:54:53,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Or this could also be a price reduction.

699
00:54:54,971 --> 00:55:00,411
[SPEAKER_06]: or it could be the game because yeah they're only I think this is maybe the game by itself without the drum

700
00:55:02,051 --> 00:55:03,132
[SPEAKER_06]: is probably what it is.

701
00:55:05,614 --> 00:55:07,796
[SPEAKER_06]: On the PlayStation 2 this week, nothing.

702
00:55:07,916 --> 00:55:08,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, nothing.

703
00:55:09,137 --> 00:55:13,961
[SPEAKER_06]: On the Nintendo DS, though, a lot of Dragon Quest games are going into the Ultimate Hits collection.

704
00:55:13,981 --> 00:55:22,108
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be 4, 9, and 5 all get price reductions for Squeenix, as well as Final Fantasy 4.

705
00:55:22,188 --> 00:55:23,949
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a big week for price reductions.

706
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:28,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, there is Bomberman, Touchland...

707
00:55:28,513 --> 00:55:31,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Star Bomber No Miracle World gets a price reduction as well.

708
00:55:32,096 --> 00:55:37,081
[SPEAKER_06]: And probably a big, big release this week in Japan, which is why everything else is kind of limited this week.

709
00:55:37,441 --> 00:55:40,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Pokemon Ranger, Hikari no Kiseki comes out this week.

710
00:55:41,826 --> 00:55:42,907
[SPEAKER_06]: This is...

711
00:55:44,542 --> 00:55:45,543
[SPEAKER_06]: This is different.

712
00:55:45,563 --> 00:55:48,966
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not like the gold and silver in those games.

713
00:55:48,986 --> 00:55:51,869
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's what that means.

714
00:55:51,889 --> 00:55:53,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's a little description here.

715
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:57,313
[SPEAKER_06]: The Pokemon nappers are catching Pokemon and involving them in shady activities.

716
00:55:58,214 --> 00:56:00,156
[SPEAKER_06]: There are more than 300... Shut up.

717
00:56:00,456 --> 00:56:02,817
[SPEAKER_06]: There are more than 300 species of Pokemons.

718
00:56:03,137 --> 00:56:03,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Pokeporn.

719
00:56:04,317 --> 00:56:06,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of them you've seen in HeartGold and Silver.

720
00:56:06,718 --> 00:56:09,519
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you tame them and you can get them to join you in battle.

721
00:56:09,559 --> 00:56:13,520
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not, like I'm just looking at the screenshots, it's not the same type of game as the other games.

722
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:16,461
[SPEAKER_06]: This looks a little more like action-y, actually, for some reason.

723
00:56:17,622 --> 00:56:18,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Like a tactics game?

724
00:56:19,182 --> 00:56:21,263
[SPEAKER_06]: No, like, it looks like it's almost like mini-games.

725
00:56:21,303 --> 00:56:25,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, this one looks like, see how it's kind of like first-person flight type of game there?

726
00:56:25,284 --> 00:56:25,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

727
00:56:25,564 --> 00:56:27,525
[SPEAKER_06]: And then this one looks like some type of running.

728
00:56:28,065 --> 00:56:30,466
[SPEAKER_06]: This one looks like they're drawing on the DS screen.

729
00:56:31,506 --> 00:56:34,967
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like it's almost like a mix of mini-games and Pokemon or something.

730
00:56:36,148 --> 00:56:36,688
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there you go.

731
00:56:39,061 --> 00:56:44,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Lastly on the PSP, .hack slash link comes out on the PSP.

732
00:56:44,642 --> 00:56:47,263
[SPEAKER_06]: That's another big release, so check that out.

733
00:56:47,503 --> 00:56:52,243
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're a fan of the .hack series, the PSP gets a new .hack game this week.

734
00:56:52,603 --> 00:56:55,664
[SPEAKER_06]: They call it the grand finale you've all been waiting for.

735
00:56:57,504 --> 00:56:57,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck.

736
00:56:58,965 --> 00:57:00,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move to the UK, DarkSakura.

737
00:57:01,525 --> 00:57:02,045
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to.

738
00:57:03,505 --> 00:57:04,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we move there?

739
00:57:05,626 --> 00:57:06,746
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I can't afford it.

740
00:57:07,495 --> 00:57:32,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well on the 3rd of March we have Toy Soldiers, on the 5th we have Alice in Wonderland, and then Assassin's Creed 2 for PC, Battlefield Bad Company 2, BlazBlue Calamity Trigger, Dementium 2 on the DS, Picross 3D, Silent Hunter 5 by Ubisoft, and Supreme Hunter 2, and Sushi Go Round for the DS and the Wii.

741
00:57:34,456 --> 00:57:35,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Mmm, sushi.

742
00:57:36,097 --> 00:57:36,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay, sushi.

743
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:43,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys and then we're going to get into the classic game of the week.

744
00:57:43,087 --> 00:57:44,530
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll just give you a little hint.

745
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:46,793
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to give away what DarkSakura's picked.

746
00:57:46,813 --> 00:57:48,416
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to say it's really old.

747
00:57:50,279 --> 00:57:51,020
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's not a bad thing.

748
00:57:52,998 --> 00:57:53,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh.

749
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:58,603
[SPEAKER_02]: So apparently Activision is being sued for false patent marketing.

750
00:57:59,283 --> 00:58:10,432
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that is, is basically that Activision is filing patents for its products that are beyond the scope of what it's producing.

751
00:58:11,033 --> 00:58:19,279
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, there's patent 753, which is basically a DDR pad, which would...

752
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:20,300
[SPEAKER_02]: C1-6

753
00:58:40,801 --> 00:58:45,926
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the group behind us, the patent compliance group.

754
00:58:46,226 --> 00:58:49,769
[SPEAKER_02]: They're seeking, and this is almost to the point where it's retarded.

755
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:53,372
[SPEAKER_02]: They're seeking $500 for each Activision violation.

756
00:58:53,392 --> 00:58:53,372
$500.

757
00:58:54,393 --> 00:58:54,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

758
00:58:54,593 --> 00:58:54,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

759
00:58:59,198 --> 00:59:05,907
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, but apparently, um, they're also, you know, targeting other companies as well.

760
00:59:06,588 --> 00:59:08,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, just Activision happens to be one of those.

761
00:59:08,971 --> 00:59:13,637
[SPEAKER_02]: And according to, uh, Mark, looks like, uh, Mathenitus, uh, uh,

762
00:59:14,578 --> 00:59:21,702
[SPEAKER_02]: The statute in question is one that actually penalizes false marketing that a product is patented or patent pending.

763
00:59:21,762 --> 00:59:27,505
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea that those false markings might deter someone from trying to create something new in that area.

764
00:59:28,325 --> 00:59:30,847
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, hey look, we have a...

765
00:59:31,747 --> 00:59:59,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Patent for a DDR controller You can't make any dance games It's like they're calling dibs on everything Dibs on this, dibs on this And then they don't do anything with it And we're going to get into another story a little later on tonight About something that they're like Nope, nope, can't have it, it's ours And they're not going to do anything with it As much as a silly lawsuit as this sounds I'm glad someone's calling them on it Because now Activision is going to have to respond to this Has Activision made a response to this?

766
01:00:01,239 --> 01:00:10,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they haven't made a response yet, but at the same time, I don't see how they can, you know, patent a DDR pad when a DDR pad's already been made.

767
01:00:11,286 --> 01:00:11,766
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

768
01:00:11,806 --> 01:00:15,088
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you can't patent something that already exists.

769
01:00:15,429 --> 01:00:20,452
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't say, hey look, I invented the rock, now you all owe me money because you have rocks.

770
01:00:21,533 --> 01:00:49,294
[SPEAKER_06]: well maybe they changed a couple little things well that's how it works patent law in this country is really weird really weird they change one or two things and claim it that they invented the genre we know how that works we'll see what comes forth of that I'm really looking forward to what Activision has to say about that remember when Activision was like the best game company in the world because they made games like Pitfall and Kaboom and Keystone Capers

771
01:00:49,684 --> 01:01:03,404
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Bobby Kotick came along His days are numbered, I'm telling you His days are numbered because he looks Just lately in the past couple years He's come out and looked like a buffoon He's douchey mcdouche Nobody likes their CEO to be a douche

772
01:01:04,659 --> 01:01:06,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, how about something for free?

773
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:07,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Free games.

774
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, this is the way to do business.

775
01:01:09,501 --> 01:01:10,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Activision, take notes.

776
01:01:11,341 --> 01:01:11,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Free games.

777
01:01:12,121 --> 01:01:14,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I'll tell you even better than that, DarkSakura.

778
01:01:14,302 --> 01:01:15,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Free Peggle.

779
01:01:15,722 --> 01:01:16,183
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

780
01:01:16,303 --> 01:01:18,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Free Peggle.

781
01:01:18,123 --> 01:01:24,805
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a promotion going on right now where you can get Peggle Nights for yourself or a loved one, family member, or even an enemy if you want.

782
01:01:24,845 --> 01:01:25,245
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

783
01:01:25,766 --> 01:01:29,647
[SPEAKER_06]: All you have to do, you sign up for PopCap's newsletter by going to PopCap.com.

784
01:01:31,228 --> 01:01:52,209
[SPEAKER_06]: by the way of course that means they're going to spam your email with all the newsletters but hey I don't know about you I have an email just set up for spam so to sign up for different websites bug me not so yeah there you go if you want there's also websites too with disposable email addresses that'll last for about 10 minutes enough time for them to send you back your confirmation code and then poof it's gone nice

785
01:01:53,988 --> 01:01:57,272
[SPEAKER_06]: I always liked the idea of setting up my own domain.

786
01:01:57,312 --> 01:01:58,172
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a friend that did this.

787
01:01:58,192 --> 01:02:00,835
[SPEAKER_06]: He had his own domain that he set up for email addresses.

788
01:02:01,256 --> 01:02:09,104
[SPEAKER_06]: And what he would do is when he would sign up for websites, he would create a new email account on his domain that was like, you know, whatever his name was.

789
01:02:09,124 --> 01:02:14,890
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll say John dot and then whatever the name of the site was that he was signing up for.

790
01:02:15,310 --> 01:02:15,570
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

791
01:02:33,762 --> 01:02:41,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Question from our chat room, Kossin, and I apologize if I'm saying that wrong, but Kossin says, what's the disposable email site called?

792
01:02:41,688 --> 01:02:44,249
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember, but I saw it in 2600 Magazine a while back.

793
01:02:44,850 --> 01:02:51,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, there's a few of them, because Gold Anthro follows up with Dispostable.com, and Robocoon says Meltmail.com.

794
01:02:51,554 --> 01:02:53,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Dispostable, I think, is the one I was thinking of.

795
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:57,218
[SPEAKER_06]: And Toagak just simply says there are lots of them, so there's a few of them out there.

796
01:02:58,419 --> 01:03:00,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Wherever they can stick a banner ad, that's what they're going to do.

797
01:03:01,241 --> 01:03:05,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we're going to get into a segment here on the show that we love to do every week.

798
01:03:05,142 --> 01:03:06,642
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Classic Game of the Week.

799
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:23,026
[SPEAKER_06]: And during the Classic Game of the Week, we encourage DarkSakura to dive into the vault of classic gaming and find a game that she says, you know what, kids and adults too, you should be playing this game this week because it's a classic game.

800
01:03:23,346 --> 01:03:25,086
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're not playing this, you're a buffoon.

801
01:03:25,606 --> 01:03:27,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, a butt-foon.

802
01:03:27,907 --> 01:03:30,127
[SPEAKER_06]: So what should the non-buffoons be playing this week?

803
01:03:30,546 --> 01:03:31,647
[SPEAKER_09]: The game is Venture.

804
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:33,488
[SPEAKER_09]: It's from 1981.

805
01:03:33,668 --> 01:03:36,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, that's old.

806
01:03:36,609 --> 01:03:36,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

807
01:03:36,909 --> 01:03:38,070
[SPEAKER_06]: That's older than most of our listeners.

808
01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:40,411
[SPEAKER_09]: I was five when this game came out.

809
01:03:40,511 --> 01:03:45,093
[SPEAKER_06]: So since this is such an old game, there's not a lot of music, but let's play some... There's actually plenty of music in this one.

810
01:03:45,794 --> 01:03:47,234
[SPEAKER_06]: With some ambient noises and stuff?

811
01:03:47,275 --> 01:03:47,995
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's a lot of music.

812
01:03:48,015 --> 01:03:48,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there actual music?

813
01:03:48,455 --> 01:03:48,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Just listen.

814
01:03:48,955 --> 01:03:49,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

815
01:03:54,874 --> 01:04:01,739
[SPEAKER_09]: The one posted here is actually the ClicoVision version specifically because I played a crap ton of this on ClicoVision.

816
01:04:04,662 --> 01:04:08,485
[SPEAKER_09]: But the game is where you're this little guy named Winky who looks like kind of a sperm.

817
01:04:08,765 --> 01:04:11,848
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, kind of like a... Yeah, whatever.

818
01:04:12,845 --> 01:04:14,566
[SPEAKER_09]: This little blob with a bow and arrow.

819
01:04:15,007 --> 01:04:17,709
[SPEAKER_09]: And he walks around this hall with these big things.

820
01:04:17,849 --> 01:04:21,093
[SPEAKER_09]: I used to call them boogers when I was playing this as a kid.

821
01:04:23,495 --> 01:04:25,697
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're just these tentacled hall monsters.

822
01:04:27,058 --> 01:04:27,939
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't kill them.

823
01:04:27,979 --> 01:04:28,940
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't stop them.

824
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:31,182
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just completely invulnerable.

825
01:04:32,283 --> 01:04:32,383
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

826
01:04:34,844 --> 01:04:45,938
[SPEAKER_09]: With that, you actually have to go into these four or five rooms per area, and then get the treasure that's in each room while you're shooting and avoiding the little creatures inside them, and each one has their own theme.

827
01:04:48,401 --> 01:04:53,788
[SPEAKER_09]: If you touch one of the monsters, it's called, you're getting carrioned.

828
01:04:55,458 --> 01:04:56,879
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

829
01:05:23,636 --> 01:05:25,517
[SPEAKER_09]: and you've got different types of dungeons.

830
01:05:25,537 --> 01:05:28,218
[SPEAKER_06]: You cannot touch a corpse because they're smelly.

831
01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:29,118
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll get carrioned.

832
01:05:30,379 --> 01:05:34,060
[SPEAKER_09]: In level one, you've got the wall room, the serpent room, the skeleton room, the goblin room.

833
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:38,421
[SPEAKER_09]: In level two, you have the two-headed room, the dragon room, the spider room, the troll room.

834
01:05:38,441 --> 01:05:39,962
[SPEAKER_09]: I can tell you the dragon room was pain in the ass.

835
01:05:40,682 --> 01:05:43,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Level three, you have the genie room, the demon room, the cyclops room, and the bat room.

836
01:05:46,969 --> 01:06:14,743
[SPEAKER_09]: but I freaking love this game this is kind of weird because I noticed especially for being such an old game like you have this screen that's like zoomed out showing all the different rooms and then you kind of like go into one room that's the dragon room by the way pain in the ass but now this is one of those games keep in mind I had a ClicoVision for a long time like I remember MTV coming out and me having a ClicoVision

837
01:06:16,454 --> 01:06:20,916
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember those in a span of, you know, when I lived in the same house.

838
01:06:20,936 --> 01:06:21,656
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll put it that way.

839
01:06:27,379 --> 01:06:29,760
[SPEAKER_09]: My mother used to play a lot of this.

840
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:32,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, my mom's favorite game was Space Fury.

841
01:06:32,061 --> 01:06:32,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you remember that?

842
01:06:33,581 --> 01:06:34,762
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because I didn't have a click of it.

843
01:06:34,822 --> 01:06:37,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Space Fury was kind of like an Asteroids kind of game.

844
01:06:40,212 --> 01:06:43,133
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the type of stuff that I bet is coming to Microsoft's game room.

845
01:06:43,153 --> 01:06:50,876
[SPEAKER_06]: When they talk about like a thousand classic games, you're going to see somebody digging into the back catalog of a lot of the old systems like ColecoVision and Atari.

846
01:06:50,936 --> 01:06:52,536
[SPEAKER_09]: I could probably make this in Flash now.

847
01:06:53,436 --> 01:06:56,457
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, seriously, I probably know enough Flash now to make this game.

848
01:06:57,418 --> 01:06:58,538
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure there's clones out there.

849
01:06:59,058 --> 01:07:04,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but honestly, this was seriously one of my favorite games when I was a little kid.

850
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,822
[SPEAKER_09]: And I love the little dinky music.

851
01:07:07,842 --> 01:07:10,064
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd go around humming this one to myself when I was a kid.

852
01:07:11,285 --> 01:07:14,688
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you know, the games that I had at the time, I had like Mousetrap and Carnival.

853
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:17,791
[SPEAKER_09]: But this one got tons of play.

854
01:07:18,011 --> 01:07:19,573
[SPEAKER_09]: This one and Turbo.

855
01:07:20,714 --> 01:07:20,914
[SPEAKER_09]: But...

856
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:26,922
[SPEAKER_11]: And it actually had pretty good music for when it came out.

857
01:07:26,963 --> 01:07:28,083
[SPEAKER_06]: For 81, yeah.

858
01:07:29,084 --> 01:07:32,326
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go, your classic video game of the week, Venture.

859
01:07:32,446 --> 01:07:36,629
[SPEAKER_06]: It was an arcade game too, but I guess DarkSakura was really referencing the ColecoVision one.

860
01:07:36,949 --> 01:07:38,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Was the arcade version really different?

861
01:07:38,911 --> 01:07:39,411
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not really.

862
01:07:40,652 --> 01:07:42,353
[SPEAKER_09]: The ColecoVision one I think came out in...

863
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:47,735
[SPEAKER_06]: 82?

864
01:07:46,515 --> 01:07:47,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's some from the arcade version.

865
01:07:47,755 --> 01:07:49,536
[SPEAKER_06]: I just noticed this related little video here.

866
01:07:49,576 --> 01:07:51,356
[SPEAKER_06]: I just kind of want to take a peek and see how it's different.

867
01:07:51,756 --> 01:07:53,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, it's very similar looking.

868
01:07:53,457 --> 01:07:55,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Almost like it's done on the same hardware or something.

869
01:07:55,657 --> 01:07:57,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Except there's a little bit more animation.

870
01:07:58,097 --> 01:07:58,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

871
01:08:01,858 --> 01:08:03,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, when you go in the rooms it zooms in.

872
01:08:06,239 --> 01:08:06,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

873
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:07,919
[SPEAKER_09]: But it had the same gameplay.

874
01:08:08,199 --> 01:08:08,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

875
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:10,980
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of interesting.

876
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:11,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Oops, sorry.

877
01:08:12,406 --> 01:08:12,647
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

878
01:08:12,947 --> 01:08:16,956
[SPEAKER_09]: But honestly, for me, it was all about... I mean, the rooms are all the same.

879
01:08:16,976 --> 01:08:19,100
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just they zoom in and out.

880
01:08:20,283 --> 01:08:22,427
[SPEAKER_09]: But this was totally like my game.

881
01:08:23,083 --> 01:08:24,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Venture Venture Venture Venture

882
01:08:48,838 --> 01:08:51,760
[SPEAKER_06]: My timeline from back then is not that great.

883
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:52,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me check.

884
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:54,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, look that up real quick because I'm curious.

885
01:08:54,761 --> 01:08:57,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there are some similarities of sorts between the two.

886
01:08:57,703 --> 01:09:00,124
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've seen comparisons to Berserk as well.

887
01:09:00,484 --> 01:09:05,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the Hallmonster is actually sort of like the evil Otto from Berserk.

888
01:09:05,487 --> 01:09:07,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is the bouncing happy face, if anyone's actually played that.

889
01:09:08,528 --> 01:09:10,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Good stuff.

890
01:09:11,770 --> 01:09:12,790
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't find Adventure.

891
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:13,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh well.

892
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:16,552
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe actually spelling it right would be nice.

893
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:17,650
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

894
01:09:35,973 --> 01:09:43,465
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, we're going to take a quick break here at Orange Lounge Radio, but fear not, we'll be back with more in tonight's Part B. So stick around, folks.

895
01:09:43,926 --> 01:09:47,311
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be right back in just a minute with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

896
01:09:49,306 --> 01:09:56,271
[SPEAKER_06]: And for those of you guys listening live tonight, we're going to take a quick music break here in studio and then we'll come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

897
01:09:56,592 --> 01:10:01,896
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just going to do some potpourri here of some various, I think we'll do some Bomani songs tonight.

898
01:10:01,936 --> 01:10:02,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

899
01:10:03,037 --> 01:10:07,000
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be right back in just a moment here live at All Games Radio with Part B of Orange Lounge Radio.

900
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:09,522
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a chance for you to get up and stretch and all that good stuff.

901
01:10:10,322 --> 01:10:10,943
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you in a minute.

902
01:10:16,707 --> 01:10:19,148
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

903
01:10:41,380 --> 01:11:04,589
[SPEAKER_06]: But we played a remix by Mr. T Not the I pity the foo kind from the A-Team But Mr. T that did Bomani remixes back in the day From Poppin' Music 10 He did a remix of Goonies Are Good Enough From Goonies 2 Which was also in the movie, the Cyndi Lauper song Now I can play a clip So let me play a quick little clip For the benefit of the podcast listeners

904
01:11:13,616 --> 01:11:14,617
[SPEAKER_06]: F the Haters

905
01:11:38,103 --> 01:11:39,684
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network

906
01:12:03,153 --> 01:12:08,519
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like an experimental thing because this is television essentially that was made for the PlayStation Network.

907
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:15,568
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a reality show and I know we've reported on this on the show before so I think most of our listeners are already aware.

908
01:12:15,868 --> 01:12:21,294
[SPEAKER_06]: It's this reality show where the prize is to become a game tester for Sony Computer Entertainment.

909
01:12:21,334 --> 01:12:22,155
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the prize.

910
01:12:23,076 --> 01:12:28,343
[SPEAKER_06]: And, but one thing they also don't say very well, also a $5,000 signing bonus.

911
01:12:28,724 --> 01:12:30,766
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is a cash prize that goes with it as well.

912
01:12:31,267 --> 01:12:33,910
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is at least just that.

913
01:12:33,930 --> 01:12:35,593
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll need it to offset the wages.

914
01:12:36,874 --> 01:12:38,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I checked out the show.

915
01:12:38,496 --> 01:12:40,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if you guys don't already know, I am...

916
01:12:41,580 --> 01:13:10,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Unapologetically a fan of reality game shows I don't necessarily mean all reality TV But I loved Survivor back in the day I wanted to apply for Survivor actually way back in the day But I didn't have a passport or something So I didn't do it I remember when they were casting for the first season of Survivor But I just love old game shows And I like the whole idea of a reality game show I've done fan games online I even like Project Runway And my new favorite reality game show is RuPaul's Drag Race It's the most amazing show on television right now

917
01:13:10,956 --> 01:13:11,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

918
01:13:30,709 --> 01:13:34,612
[SPEAKER_06]: But of course, obviously, hearing about the tester, I'm a little bit apprehensive about this.

919
01:13:34,632 --> 01:13:36,733
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm like, okay, I'm a fan of reality shows.

920
01:13:36,853 --> 01:13:37,754
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a fan of video games.

921
01:13:38,194 --> 01:13:40,355
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to check this show out and give it a fair shot.

922
01:13:40,735 --> 01:13:42,136
[SPEAKER_06]: So I downloaded the show.

923
01:13:42,256 --> 01:13:44,038
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about a 22-minute show.

924
01:13:44,098 --> 01:13:46,739
[SPEAKER_06]: It's suitable for a 30-minute broadcast, basically with commercial breaks.

925
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:51,662
[SPEAKER_06]: And I watched it, and it's not that bad.

926
01:13:53,183 --> 01:13:54,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you surprised to hear me say that?

927
01:13:55,044 --> 01:13:55,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

928
01:13:55,445 --> 01:13:55,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

929
01:13:56,189 --> 01:13:58,250
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not terrible.

930
01:13:59,611 --> 01:14:01,433
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a ridiculous concept.

931
01:14:01,833 --> 01:14:14,962
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm not going to get past the fact that we all know, if you've kind of had a friend that works in the gaming industry, we all know the prize at the end of the day is ridiculous, but at least they throw a $5,000 signing bonus into it, so at least there's that.

932
01:14:16,482 --> 01:14:17,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

933
01:14:36,676 --> 01:14:41,584
[SPEAKER_06]: The look of it was really good and it was put together okay.

934
01:14:41,624 --> 01:14:48,955
[SPEAKER_06]: The editing was really tight because it's only a 22 minute show so you don't really get a lot of time to know the people but the editing was competent.

935
01:14:49,196 --> 01:14:51,299
[SPEAKER_06]: The show was put together well enough

936
01:14:52,721 --> 01:15:05,671
[SPEAKER_06]: The biggest flaw about the show is that, again, the contest is so ridiculous to begin with that basically the whole elimination and everything that they did was over this one minor challenge that they did.

937
01:15:05,711 --> 01:15:13,878
[SPEAKER_06]: That the judges, who were two guys that worked for Sony and Hal Sparks, which I don't know why Hal Sparks is a judge and not the host.

938
01:15:14,358 --> 01:15:42,354
[SPEAKER_06]: But whatever, I realize they need to have some type of celebrity draw I actually like Hal Sparks, I think he's great on The Soup back in the day when he was doing that stuff And then the I Love the 90s and all those shows I think he's funny, and of course queer as folk So I think he's a good talent to have on there Although as a judge, I think he would have been a better host Because they have some no-name girl doing the hosting And she's a generic reality show host, whatever

939
01:15:43,359 --> 01:15:44,440
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

940
01:16:06,557 --> 01:16:07,077
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com.

941
01:16:21,824 --> 01:16:49,843
[SPEAKER_06]: but here's the other thing I want to say about this because I know a lot of people are saying like what the hell Rob you actually like the show I don't know if I go so far as to say like I like it I'm going to set a season pass on my TiVo I just think it was a competent show and quite honestly it's better than about 90% of what's on G4 television here's my problem is I the way I looked at it is when I heard that they're doing a reality show where people are going to get to play you know games and stuff like that you know that are you know first looks at certain games I saw that as

942
01:16:50,023 --> 01:16:53,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey look, it's a 22 minute long commercial for Sony Games.

943
01:16:53,825 --> 01:16:54,545
[SPEAKER_02]: No thanks.

944
01:17:12,153 --> 01:17:12,674
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that, Jamie?

945
01:17:30,808 --> 01:17:32,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing, I was talking about Shermie.

946
01:17:32,730 --> 01:17:32,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

947
01:17:33,010 --> 01:17:34,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Shermie just crapped.

948
01:17:34,371 --> 01:17:34,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, did she?

949
01:17:35,012 --> 01:17:36,333
[SPEAKER_09]: That was her review of the show.

950
01:17:37,854 --> 01:17:38,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

951
01:17:39,135 --> 01:17:41,897
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I mean, they played it up okay.

952
01:17:42,138 --> 01:17:43,639
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I was expecting a lot worse.

953
01:17:43,839 --> 01:17:44,860
[SPEAKER_06]: The bar was very low.

954
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:50,124
[SPEAKER_06]: But I got a show that I would watch if I was flipping through TVs with nothing to watch.

955
01:17:50,445 --> 01:17:52,606
[SPEAKER_06]: And I stop on G4 TV and the show's on.

956
01:17:52,927 --> 01:17:55,429
[SPEAKER_06]: It's better than most of the crap on that network right now.

957
01:17:55,816 --> 01:17:59,617
[SPEAKER_09]: That still just doesn't sound like enough to make me actually put any effort into watching TV.

958
01:18:01,078 --> 01:18:02,418
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't recommend this show for you, Jamie.

959
01:18:02,438 --> 01:18:03,158
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think you'd like it.

960
01:18:05,319 --> 01:18:10,401
[SPEAKER_09]: I watch three shows with any variety of regularity.

961
01:18:11,261 --> 01:18:13,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Supernatural, Doctor Who, and...

962
01:18:16,786 --> 01:18:18,228
[SPEAKER_09]: I love drag queens so much.

963
01:18:18,288 --> 01:18:18,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Me too.

964
01:18:18,948 --> 01:18:19,108
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

965
01:18:19,329 --> 01:18:19,809
[SPEAKER_06]: On Xbox Live.

966
01:18:19,969 --> 01:18:20,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

967
01:18:34,955 --> 01:18:38,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that they're going to have the Microsoft Game Room thing.

968
01:18:38,697 --> 01:18:38,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

969
01:18:39,458 --> 01:18:41,559
[SPEAKER_02]: To bring back Starcade.

970
01:18:41,759 --> 01:18:42,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

971
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:50,864
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, you've got to think, though, this is, sure, this show is a little eh, but it could be setting the stage for something even greater in the future.

972
01:18:50,944 --> 01:18:55,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, it's kind of interesting that, wow, Sony put all this together.

973
01:18:55,647 --> 01:19:00,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Who else might deliver their show exclusively on PlayStation Network or Xbox Live Arcade?

974
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:02,491
[SPEAKER_06]: And, yeah, I'm all for Starcade coming back.

975
01:19:02,771 --> 01:19:04,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Or some type of old school game show.

976
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:30,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Like 1 vs. 100, but Starcade where you play the games that they're playing during the show and stuff like that That was a great idea To answer Tigerclaw, I wasn't impressed enough with the first episode of V to give it any more thought And for the listeners that don't know what DarkSakura's talking about Tigerclaw said V next month, you gotta watch V So there you go Oh, Shermie took a duty in the hallway, that's no good

977
01:19:32,978 --> 01:19:59,835
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what she thinks of the tester A shit with no effort I can't believe the cat just took a dump on the floor in the middle of the show Dump where dump should not be on the PlayStation Network Which cat, when forced to watch the tester, takes a crap first?

978
01:20:03,743 --> 01:20:08,993
[SPEAKER_09]: No, to explain, Shermie is an old lady.

979
01:20:09,755 --> 01:20:11,778
[SPEAKER_09]: She's up there now in cat ears.

980
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:15,065
[SPEAKER_03]: So she just didn't make it to the litter box or what?

981
01:20:16,027 --> 01:20:16,788
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

982
01:20:38,408 --> 01:20:38,849
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no.

983
01:20:39,169 --> 01:20:44,613
[SPEAKER_09]: She will do it either when she decides to poop somewhere that is not her box.

984
01:20:45,254 --> 01:20:49,037
[SPEAKER_09]: She will either do it on one of the bathroom rugs right in front of the bathroom or on one of the kitchen rugs.

985
01:20:49,798 --> 01:20:53,561
[SPEAKER_09]: She does not do it so much on one of the kitchen rugs because I yelled at her.

986
01:20:54,742 --> 01:20:57,084
[SPEAKER_09]: She at least does it where it can be easily cleaned up.

987
01:20:58,064 --> 01:20:59,325
[SPEAKER_09]: I think she's making a statement.

988
01:20:59,385 --> 01:21:01,707
[SPEAKER_09]: I think she's like, Mom, you should quit your job and pay attention to me 24-7.

989
01:21:03,807 --> 01:21:04,728
[SPEAKER_06]: She cats it all the time.

990
01:21:05,048 --> 01:21:08,470
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's stop talking about poop and talk about game news.

991
01:21:09,410 --> 01:21:12,732
[SPEAKER_02]: She says this show is good for me to poop on.

992
01:21:13,892 --> 01:21:14,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Clearly.

993
01:21:15,173 --> 01:21:17,114
[SPEAKER_06]: How about some rapid fire news, Loki?

994
01:21:17,514 --> 01:21:17,854
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

995
01:21:18,435 --> 01:21:21,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's actually this is kind of... Real quick, sorry.

996
01:21:21,396 --> 01:21:22,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Get your tweets in.

997
01:21:22,757 --> 01:21:28,480
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I mentioned it before in the show, but if you have some tweets for tonight's Twitter topics, get those in now, now, now.

998
01:21:29,188 --> 01:21:30,128
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of interesting.

999
01:21:30,208 --> 01:21:39,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Meat Boy is coming to Xbox Live Arcade, and actually before the WiiWare version, which I didn't even realize there was an Xbox Live Arcade version, and now it's coming out before.

1000
01:21:39,872 --> 01:21:44,734
[SPEAKER_02]: It's scheduled to be coming out this summer, and that's pretty cool.

1001
01:21:44,754 --> 01:21:51,076
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those who don't know, Super Meat Boy is a platform action game starring a little character that's made out of meat.

1002
01:21:51,976 --> 01:21:55,397
[SPEAKER_02]: and you splat around the screen and that's all fun.

1003
01:21:56,838 --> 01:22:16,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Then of course there's going to be a tie-in game with the new movie Kick-Ass that is coming to PlayStation 3 and the iPhone and of course this game kind of reminds me a little bit of The Watchmen The End is Nigh which I think did a little bit better on the PS3 probably because the Blu-ray was bundled with the game.

1004
01:22:17,864 --> 01:22:18,784
[SPEAKER_02]: when it came out in retail.

1005
01:22:18,864 --> 01:22:24,226
[SPEAKER_02]: But the PS3 game will have Facebook integration as well.

1006
01:22:25,086 --> 01:22:27,887
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1007
01:22:28,247 --> 01:22:30,127
[SPEAKER_02]: The game looks just okay.

1008
01:22:30,627 --> 01:22:33,328
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks just like a beat-em-up action game, just like the Watchmen one.

1009
01:22:34,809 --> 01:22:36,629
[SPEAKER_02]: The movie, though, on the other hand, is pretty awesome.

1010
01:22:36,849 --> 01:22:43,331
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of what happens when kids decide to become superheroes, but they don't have superpowers.

1011
01:22:43,531 --> 01:22:44,311
[SPEAKER_02]: They just fight crime.

1012
01:22:45,956 --> 01:22:47,583
[SPEAKER_02]: and Scott Nicholas Cage acting weird.

1013
01:22:49,521 --> 01:22:55,105
[SPEAKER_02]: and then on the PlayStation Network the version of Castle Crashers is getting a brand new edition.

1014
01:22:55,966 --> 01:23:01,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Extreme Volleyball Action is coming to the PlayStation 3 version of Castle Crashers.

1015
01:23:03,051 --> 01:23:17,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently they're including a cooperative and competitive volleyball game with online or offline play and Magic Attacks apparently will be directly applied to your ball as well as there's going to be some leaderboards

1016
01:23:19,143 --> 01:23:22,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Spiky Moves, and some other stuff.

1017
01:23:22,905 --> 01:23:26,127
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is coming from the Behemoth Development Blog.

1018
01:23:28,329 --> 01:23:32,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Jamie's having the great Lysol race in the hallway right now.

1019
01:23:32,831 --> 01:23:34,072
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good thing I can't smell anything.

1020
01:23:34,092 --> 01:23:35,913
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, you're congested.

1021
01:23:35,953 --> 01:23:36,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't smell a thing.

1022
01:23:36,994 --> 01:23:38,014
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just being polite.

1023
01:23:38,054 --> 01:23:40,176
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't want to sit here and go, Jamie, your house smells like poop.

1024
01:23:40,316 --> 01:23:41,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, no, I just smelled it.

1025
01:23:42,837 --> 01:23:43,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Fucking Shermie.

1026
01:23:44,278 --> 01:23:44,838
[SPEAKER_09]: She just needs a...

1027
01:23:46,966 --> 01:23:50,854
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I don't know, maybe all this talk about the tester made Jamie crap her pants.

1028
01:23:51,014 --> 01:23:52,277
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to be rude.

1029
01:23:52,638 --> 01:23:55,724
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it sure makes shit in the hall.

1030
01:23:55,764 --> 01:23:56,686
[SPEAKER_03]: At least go in the tub.

1031
01:24:00,763 --> 01:24:02,103
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a reference to last week's show.

1032
01:24:02,123 --> 01:24:02,724
[SPEAKER_06]: You see what I did there?

1033
01:24:04,184 --> 01:24:04,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Loki.

1034
01:24:04,964 --> 01:24:06,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have anything else you want to share?

1035
01:24:06,925 --> 01:24:08,145
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

1036
01:24:08,205 --> 01:24:09,866
[SPEAKER_06]: I got some quick stories for you guys.

1037
01:24:10,246 --> 01:24:11,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I did check out this game.

1038
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:16,007
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't mention it during my gaming week, but this is something I did check out this week, and that was Missile Command.

1039
01:24:16,047 --> 01:24:19,128
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a brand new version of Missile Command from Atari.

1040
01:24:19,368 --> 01:24:21,969
[SPEAKER_06]: It's free to play, and it's on the web, and it's like a co-op.

1041
01:24:22,289 --> 01:24:25,590
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually a multiplayer thing by developer OMGPOP.

1042
01:24:26,121 --> 01:24:27,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Atari.com slash Missile Command It's free, can't complain about free

1043
01:24:50,385 --> 01:24:52,327
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not surprised 505 Games is the publisher I think

1044
01:25:17,788 --> 01:25:19,049
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, yeah, they are the publisher.

1045
01:25:19,129 --> 01:25:20,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's developing it?

1046
01:25:20,330 --> 01:25:21,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Big Head Games.

1047
01:25:21,831 --> 01:25:23,211
[SPEAKER_06]: They did Chime on the Xbox Live.

1048
01:25:24,132 --> 01:25:25,313
[SPEAKER_06]: That was recent.

1049
01:25:25,673 --> 01:25:28,835
[SPEAKER_06]: No word as to what the game is at all.

1050
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:30,356
[SPEAKER_06]: How would you make a game out of grease?

1051
01:25:30,716 --> 01:25:31,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a karaoke game?

1052
01:25:32,097 --> 01:25:32,877
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be awful.

1053
01:25:33,037 --> 01:25:35,739
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, hey, look, we bought the rights to something.

1054
01:25:35,799 --> 01:25:37,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, let's make a game out of it.

1055
01:25:38,441 --> 01:25:40,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Not them, but other companies.

1056
01:25:40,762 --> 01:25:41,943
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll buy rights for...

1057
01:25:43,504 --> 01:25:44,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Like stupid shit.

1058
01:25:44,605 --> 01:25:46,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the smile.

1059
01:25:46,407 --> 01:25:47,869
[SPEAKER_02]: You know like the smiley face shirts?

1060
01:25:48,269 --> 01:25:48,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Smiley?

1061
01:25:48,830 --> 01:25:49,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1062
01:25:49,491 --> 01:25:51,773
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a company that bought the rights for that and made a game out of it.

1063
01:25:51,893 --> 01:25:53,335
[SPEAKER_02]: No one remembers it because it sucked.

1064
01:25:53,775 --> 01:25:56,939
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember Faceball 2000 that had the big smileys.

1065
01:25:57,059 --> 01:25:58,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a nice day.

1066
01:25:59,021 --> 01:26:00,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, but that game was actually kind of fun.

1067
01:26:01,724 --> 01:26:02,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, for example...

1068
01:26:04,908 --> 01:26:09,956
[SPEAKER_02]: The Jelly Belly, they have like a Jelly Belly game because they licensed that because the license was really cheap.

1069
01:26:09,976 --> 01:26:10,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Jelly Bellys are yummy.

1070
01:26:11,178 --> 01:26:13,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Or M&M's, they made some M&M games.

1071
01:26:13,582 --> 01:26:16,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, there was like an M&M racing game that was pretty terrible, huh?

1072
01:26:17,432 --> 01:26:22,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, Yo Noid was cool, but that was way back in the 80s when people knew what the hell the Noid was.

1073
01:26:22,574 --> 01:26:23,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Make kids.

1074
01:26:24,134 --> 01:26:25,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't the Noid supposed to be making a comeback?

1075
01:26:26,495 --> 01:26:27,476
[SPEAKER_02]: It was supposed to be.

1076
01:26:27,996 --> 01:26:30,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, how about a computer game everybody wants to play?

1077
01:26:30,336 --> 01:26:31,877
[SPEAKER_06]: There's tons and tons of people who want to play this.

1078
01:26:31,917 --> 01:26:34,398
[SPEAKER_06]: StarCraft 2, and of course the beta's going on right now.

1079
01:26:34,858 --> 01:26:35,319
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura

1080
01:27:01,084 --> 01:27:03,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this is pretty happy stuff.

1081
01:27:03,586 --> 01:27:09,592
[SPEAKER_09]: There are, for a pre-order bonus for Super Street Fighter 4, there's a classic costume pack.

1082
01:27:10,392 --> 01:27:14,556
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they are for Blanka, Guile, Gen, Feilong, and Dhalsim.

1083
01:27:15,917 --> 01:27:20,961
[SPEAKER_09]: For Feilong, he gets a kind of a Kato costume.

1084
01:27:22,162 --> 01:27:23,083
[SPEAKER_09]: I love Feilong.

1085
01:27:23,684 --> 01:27:26,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Blanka gets Dansgi costume.

1086
01:27:28,187 --> 01:27:30,429
[SPEAKER_09]: And this goes back to Street Fighter Alpha 3.

1087
01:27:31,289 --> 01:27:32,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you ever beat Street Fighter Alpha 3?

1088
01:27:32,930 --> 01:27:35,492
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I ever played Street Fighter Alpha 3.

1089
01:27:35,672 --> 01:27:38,453
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of during that period when I wasn't playing a lot of games heavy.

1090
01:27:38,854 --> 01:27:42,136
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the endings, Dan and Blanka are just hanging out.

1091
01:27:43,677 --> 01:27:45,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan can understand all of Blanka's grunts.

1092
01:27:46,331 --> 01:27:48,192
[SPEAKER_09]: So he's like, I see you, my friend.

1093
01:27:48,252 --> 01:27:49,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go out and play.

1094
01:27:49,553 --> 01:27:50,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Rolling and rolling.

1095
01:27:50,494 --> 01:27:51,954
[SPEAKER_09]: And it has the two of them rolling across the screen.

1096
01:27:51,974 --> 01:27:53,515
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where I get the rolling and rolling from.

1097
01:27:54,316 --> 01:27:56,777
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, he's wearing Dansky.

1098
01:27:57,758 --> 01:27:59,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they like gay lovers or something?

1099
01:27:59,299 --> 01:28:00,059
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so.

1100
01:28:00,419 --> 01:28:01,120
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just BFFs.

1101
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:02,460
[SPEAKER_09]: They're BFFs.

1102
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:03,861
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Jay and Silent Bob.

1103
01:28:05,142 --> 01:28:07,943
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Gen has a shirtless... Heterosexual life partners.

1104
01:28:08,163 --> 01:28:08,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1105
01:28:09,403 --> 01:28:10,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Gen is shirtless.

1106
01:28:10,784 --> 01:28:13,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Guile is wearing a ballistic vest.

1107
01:28:14,105 --> 01:28:18,107
[SPEAKER_09]: He's just all kinds of, you know, hardcore ops guy.

1108
01:28:18,707 --> 01:28:28,731
[SPEAKER_09]: And Dhalsim is wearing a, I guess, just more traditional dress for India.

1109
01:28:28,751 --> 01:28:28,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1110
01:28:30,111 --> 01:28:30,551
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1111
01:28:30,631 --> 01:28:31,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Very snazzy and lousy.

1112
01:28:31,411 --> 01:28:42,795
[SPEAKER_06]: He looks like... Who was that fighter in Mike Tyson's Punch-Out where the little ruby in his turban would flash and that's how you knew he was about to throw a punch?

1113
01:28:43,415 --> 01:28:45,236
[SPEAKER_06]: What was that guy's name in Mike Tyson's Punch-Out?

1114
01:28:45,276 --> 01:28:45,896
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.

1115
01:28:46,356 --> 01:28:47,796
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what Dhalsim looks like right there.

1116
01:28:47,917 --> 01:28:49,357
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to link the picture in the chat room.

1117
01:28:49,977 --> 01:29:16,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody in chat will yell it out There's a tiger or something Shaoran in chat by the way says bromance would be the term for what Dan and Blanca have going on there Now I have an image of Dan saying snooch to the nooch You know there's actually it's funny the term bromance there actually is a term called romantic friendship Have you ever heard of that?

1118
01:29:16,770 --> 01:29:19,311
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I have yeah I thought that was funny

1119
01:29:20,326 --> 01:29:22,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Tetsuya says Great Tiger was the name of that fighter.

1120
01:29:23,267 --> 01:29:23,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds right.

1121
01:29:24,068 --> 01:29:24,648
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he's right.

1122
01:29:26,209 --> 01:29:30,691
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I love having a live audience because when I don't know the answer to something I'll just go chat help and they do.

1123
01:29:30,971 --> 01:29:31,431
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great.

1124
01:29:32,272 --> 01:29:34,993
[SPEAKER_06]: And Actdefta is wondering if they're starting a bad bromance.

1125
01:29:37,435 --> 01:29:37,875
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1126
01:29:37,935 --> 01:29:45,322
[SPEAKER_09]: I freaking have to listen to that song now after me really loathing Lady whatever.

1127
01:29:46,584 --> 01:29:48,886
[SPEAKER_06]: You cannot resist the power of Lady Gaga.

1128
01:29:48,906 --> 01:29:49,727
[SPEAKER_06]: She's amazing.

1129
01:29:49,767 --> 01:29:51,789
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really like any of her other stuff, by the way.

1130
01:29:52,049 --> 01:29:54,231
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just that one I actually kind of like.

1131
01:29:54,351 --> 01:29:54,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody's perfect.

1132
01:29:55,132 --> 01:29:55,712
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll come around.

1133
01:29:56,013 --> 01:29:56,893
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1134
01:29:56,953 --> 01:29:58,395
[SPEAKER_09]: She'll eventually become perfect like me.

1135
01:29:58,993 --> 01:30:03,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Twitter topic time, www.twitter.com slash OLR.

1136
01:30:03,995 --> 01:30:08,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Show us your tweets every week and we'll read some of our favorites here on the program.

1137
01:30:08,936 --> 01:30:12,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, we can't read everything, but there's some really good questions tonight, so I want to get to this.

1138
01:30:13,958 --> 01:30:14,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1139
01:30:15,118 --> 01:30:17,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Nutman wants to know if the podcast will be uploaded tomorrow.

1140
01:30:17,619 --> 01:30:18,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty please.

1141
01:30:18,499 --> 01:30:18,979
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be.

1142
01:30:19,459 --> 01:30:20,840
[SPEAKER_06]: There shouldn't be a delay at all this week.

1143
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:24,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I got to say, I had last week show up Monday night, but I should...

1144
01:30:24,821 --> 01:30:29,604
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been getting pretty good this year about getting this show up within 24 hours, so I'm going to try and continue that trend.

1145
01:30:29,785 --> 01:30:30,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Knock on wood.

1146
01:30:31,306 --> 01:30:37,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft links us to a story that Harmonix might not actually be working on Rock Band 3 right now.

1147
01:30:37,170 --> 01:30:39,371
[SPEAKER_06]: There may actually be something else going on right now.

1148
01:30:40,332 --> 01:30:44,255
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess this is a news story he's linked us to from rockbandaid.com.

1149
01:30:47,417 --> 01:30:48,598
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess, let's see, what's going on here?

1150
01:30:48,638 --> 01:30:51,320
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a Twitter from some guy, I guess, at Harmonix.

1151
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:56,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Harmonix, the creators of the Rock Band video game, is planning on using one of my tracks for their demo projects.

1152
01:30:57,003 --> 01:30:57,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

1153
01:30:57,363 --> 01:30:59,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, this is some other guy.

1154
01:31:00,145 --> 01:31:04,328
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess Harmonix recently licensed hip-hop and dance songs, kind of putting it all together.

1155
01:31:04,848 --> 01:31:10,152
[SPEAKER_06]: And so now maybe there might be a new frequency or amplitude game is kind of the rumor that's going on right now.

1156
01:31:10,572 --> 01:31:31,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Which would make a lot of sense, you know, Frequency and Amplitude kind of came out when not a lot of people knew who Harmonix was And they were more experimental games, but they were great games And I think if they are gonna, you know, now that more people know what Rock Band is That they're gonna kind of come out with a, I don't know, what would they call a game around dance music and stuff That's in that Frequency, Amplitude vein, I don't know Frequency?

1157
01:31:32,189 --> 01:31:32,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Frequency 2?

1158
01:31:33,390 --> 01:31:34,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Frequitude?

1159
01:31:34,671 --> 01:31:36,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows Applency?

1160
01:31:36,312 --> 01:31:36,952
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Hero?

1161
01:31:37,092 --> 01:31:37,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh wait, no

1162
01:31:38,991 --> 01:31:39,331
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1163
01:31:39,892 --> 01:31:43,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Salvax7 sends us a variety of tweets here around one subject.

1164
01:31:43,436 --> 01:31:43,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me read these.

1165
01:31:44,016 --> 01:31:46,579
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little longer than 140 characters, but it's okay.

1166
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:47,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I like the question here.

1167
01:31:47,941 --> 01:31:49,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Salvax7 on Twitter.

1168
01:31:49,542 --> 01:31:51,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, I have an interesting question for you.

1169
01:31:51,705 --> 01:31:58,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Historically, which generation of gaming would you classify as the most contrib... It got cut off.

1170
01:31:58,212 --> 01:32:00,835
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming contributive to society's development.

1171
01:32:01,315 --> 01:32:06,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Regarding to the social interaction, the fun element, escape from one's reality, and moral values.

1172
01:32:07,378 --> 01:32:10,340
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's complex, but if you could answer it, I would appreciate it.

1173
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:11,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, guys.

1174
01:32:11,241 --> 01:32:11,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a nice one.

1175
01:32:12,561 --> 01:32:13,162
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you guys think?

1176
01:32:13,482 --> 01:32:19,345
[SPEAKER_06]: What generation of gaming would classify as the most contributive to society's development?

1177
01:32:21,892 --> 01:32:22,532
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a tough question.

1178
01:32:22,552 --> 01:32:23,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Development of what?

1179
01:32:24,013 --> 01:32:25,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Just the development of society.

1180
01:32:25,754 --> 01:32:32,957
[SPEAKER_06]: As in, and he goes on to specify, as in the social interaction, the fun element, the escape from one's reality and moral values.

1181
01:32:33,237 --> 01:32:33,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Pong.

1182
01:32:34,857 --> 01:32:35,978
[SPEAKER_06]: All the way back to old school pong.

1183
01:32:35,998 --> 01:32:36,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Where would we be?

1184
01:32:36,858 --> 01:32:39,299
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, where would the industry be if someone didn't invent pong?

1185
01:32:39,339 --> 01:32:40,520
[SPEAKER_06]: The zeroth generation?

1186
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:41,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1187
01:32:42,418 --> 01:32:44,301
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say like the arcade age or something like that.

1188
01:32:44,341 --> 01:32:56,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe even like just the, not necessarily the 8-bit generation, but like, you know, even before that, probably the 4-bit generation, you know, the Atari, Coleco, Odyssey, that kind of stuff.

1189
01:32:56,558 --> 01:32:58,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think in gaming it'd be the day that we got on the radio.

1190
01:33:00,106 --> 01:33:00,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice answer.

1191
01:33:01,247 --> 01:33:02,748
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have two answers for this question.

1192
01:33:02,788 --> 01:33:05,269
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say I think it's the fourth generation of gaming.

1193
01:33:05,629 --> 01:33:06,950
[SPEAKER_06]: The one that involved the NES.

1194
01:33:07,390 --> 01:33:16,295
[SPEAKER_06]: When the Nintendo Entertainment System first came to America because it came out at a time when video games were pretty much declared dead and dying and nobody was interested in video games anymore.

1195
01:33:16,696 --> 01:33:20,818
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, after the great video game crash of 84, 83, whatever you want to pay it as.

1196
01:33:21,218 --> 01:33:23,280
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry I'm not from your country

1197
01:33:38,115 --> 01:33:57,007
[SPEAKER_06]: even people that don't do nerdy gaming podcasts every week or listen to them they know who Mario and Luigi are you know those characters I think it was really the first generation to create a character I don't think everybody on the street knows who Pitfall Harry or maybe some of the well maybe Pac-Man I mean that came from the generation before but I think I don't know

1198
01:33:57,367 --> 01:34:01,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Something about really bringing it into the homes and so forth with these really memorable characters.

1199
01:34:01,951 --> 01:34:04,773
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was really the generation that defined current gaming.

1200
01:34:04,793 --> 01:34:09,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Then again, Pac-Man did have a song written about him and Mario really didn't other than do the Mario.

1201
01:34:11,178 --> 01:34:13,901
[SPEAKER_06]: But then my other answer to the question would be the current one.

1202
01:34:14,321 --> 01:34:18,546
[SPEAKER_06]: The current generation of gaming, I think, is huge to society because for a variety of reasons.

1203
01:34:18,986 --> 01:34:30,578
[SPEAKER_06]: A, the Wii has... As much as we love to hate on it for what it is sometimes here on this show, there's no denying that it has penetrated society in a way that most video game systems have not.

1204
01:34:30,679 --> 01:34:32,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii Sports is like...

1205
01:34:34,182 --> 01:34:36,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Such a typical video game.

1206
01:34:36,203 --> 01:34:38,303
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not even a video game to a lot of people.

1207
01:34:38,363 --> 01:34:41,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii Sports is an activity.

1208
01:34:42,024 --> 01:34:44,165
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an activity simulation.

1209
01:34:44,325 --> 01:34:46,106
[SPEAKER_06]: People don't say, let's come over and play video games.

1210
01:34:46,126 --> 01:34:49,006
[SPEAKER_06]: They say, let's come over and play Wii Sports or the Wii.

1211
01:34:49,106 --> 01:34:50,127
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just so interesting.

1212
01:34:50,167 --> 01:35:01,330
[SPEAKER_06]: And then on the other hand, you have Xbox Live really kind of, in a way, almost killing arcades because people are able to communicate over the internet and talk while they're playing games and develop this whole community.

1213
01:35:01,810 --> 01:35:25,994
[SPEAKER_06]: and then you know some somewhat the PlayStation 3 in this as well but then now that video games are not just about video games but they're entertainment boxes there are these you know sets in our living room that do everything that now that they're they're getting their own TV shows for heaven's sakes I mean I think this current one is is shaping things up in in a huge way that's going to continue certainly it's they're setting it up to have a longer lifespan than the generations before it so we'll see

1214
01:35:26,687 --> 01:35:29,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep in mind the networking side of it and the web play side of this.

1215
01:35:30,410 --> 01:35:34,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember we had the X-Link back in the day.

1216
01:35:35,115 --> 01:35:36,996
[SPEAKER_09]: We had, well in Japan they had Satellaview.

1217
01:35:37,857 --> 01:35:42,041
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not a new concept, it's a perfected concept.

1218
01:35:42,061 --> 01:35:43,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but it's now, it's penetrating.

1219
01:35:44,643 --> 01:35:48,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me, has penetrated the marketplace and had its effect on society that Sateleview didn't.

1220
01:35:48,727 --> 01:35:49,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody remembers Sateleview.

1221
01:35:49,427 --> 01:35:58,475
[SPEAKER_09]: What was a novel concept then is, and actually I didn't even have to say, one of the biggest games that came out that really brought that on was Phantasy Star Online.

1222
01:35:59,716 --> 01:36:00,357
[SPEAKER_09]: If you think about it.

1223
01:36:00,677 --> 01:36:01,117
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1224
01:36:24,266 --> 01:36:27,788
[SPEAKER_06]: But see, you know, and I'm really trying to take that question as literal as possible.

1225
01:36:27,848 --> 01:36:28,988
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the biggest impact on society?

1226
01:36:29,008 --> 01:36:30,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if you ask, what's my favorite?

1227
01:36:30,869 --> 01:36:33,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the Super Nintendo was my favorite console in that whole generation.

1228
01:36:33,611 --> 01:36:35,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo versus Sega and TurboGrafx.

1229
01:36:35,591 --> 01:36:38,253
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that was like right when I was in high school and kind of growing up.

1230
01:36:38,313 --> 01:36:39,353
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember all that stuff.

1231
01:36:39,393 --> 01:36:42,095
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was my favorite generation.

1232
01:36:42,155 --> 01:36:45,556
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't think it necessarily had the biggest impact on society.

1233
01:36:45,596 --> 01:36:46,997
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was more of a bridge.

1234
01:36:47,437 --> 01:36:49,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Video games were still a niche thing back then.

1235
01:36:49,378 --> 01:36:50,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Master System, and Genesis

1236
01:37:13,334 --> 01:37:14,837
[SPEAKER_09]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1237
01:37:26,398 --> 01:37:27,058
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an evolution.

1238
01:37:27,078 --> 01:37:33,764
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's why I want to go back very far back to pinball, Rob, to pinball.

1239
01:37:34,905 --> 01:37:39,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Some comments from our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, live on this Sunday night as we tape at All Games Radio.

1240
01:37:41,009 --> 01:37:46,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Shaoran says, World of Warcraft just standardized both the best and worst of MMO tropes.

1241
01:37:47,214 --> 01:37:50,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, it's not necessarily about inventing a concept, it's about perfecting it.

1242
01:37:50,977 --> 01:37:53,258
[SPEAKER_06]: I think is an important point that was brought up.

1243
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:54,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, that was a great question.

1244
01:37:55,039 --> 01:37:57,721
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to give an honorary gold star to Salvax.

1245
01:37:57,761 --> 01:37:58,882
[SPEAKER_06]: He gets a Twitter gold star.

1246
01:37:59,062 --> 01:38:02,904
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we've given any of those out, but that was one of my favorite Twitter questions we've gotten ever.

1247
01:38:03,024 --> 01:38:04,084
[SPEAKER_06]: So gold star for you.

1248
01:38:05,265 --> 01:38:08,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Robocoon wants to clue us in on a Steam UI update.

1249
01:38:08,707 --> 01:38:10,748
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a beta thing that you can opt into, and that's good.

1250
01:38:10,768 --> 01:38:13,870
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Steam could use a little bit of a facelift.

1251
01:38:14,490 --> 01:38:26,697
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't read this story or familiarize myself with it in advance, but apparently you can take part in the beta by going into Steam's website and the settings link and then selecting the 2010 UI update under beta participation.

1252
01:38:27,038 --> 01:38:37,184
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm looking at these screenshots and I gotta say one thing that does kind of worry me is I'm noticing in one of these screenshots there's like a list that shows community activity and it shows what games your friends are buying.

1253
01:38:38,027 --> 01:38:40,689
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I want that data out there and published.

1254
01:38:40,709 --> 01:38:44,271
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want my friends knowing that I just bought the Amazing Unicorn game.

1255
01:38:44,852 --> 01:38:46,473
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hoping there's a way to suppress that.

1256
01:38:46,773 --> 01:38:47,673
[SPEAKER_11]: Imagine fairies.

1257
01:38:49,174 --> 01:38:51,276
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure there is a way to suppress that.

1258
01:38:52,472 --> 01:39:12,843
[SPEAKER_06]: but there is there's some unicorn game that's out there on Steam and my boyfriend's been tempting me with this saying you know you want this game you know you want this game when obviously it looks like such crap but it's kind of one of those things like I want to like buy it for you as a gift so you're obligated to play it and then you have to talk about it on next week's OLR during How Was Your Gaming Week like I think we actually had that conversation are you pulling it up right now or what?

1259
01:39:13,443 --> 01:39:14,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, I'm going on my Steam.

1260
01:39:15,685 --> 01:39:16,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Look for the Unicorn Gamer.

1261
01:39:16,805 --> 01:39:18,967
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to get a text message in a minute that'll tell me what it is.

1262
01:39:20,127 --> 01:39:21,268
[SPEAKER_06]: What magical unicorn game?

1263
01:39:21,568 --> 01:39:23,029
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something about magical unicorns.

1264
01:39:23,229 --> 01:39:26,431
[SPEAKER_06]: There's an awesome... Okay, not even... Oh, God, here we go.

1265
01:39:26,531 --> 01:39:28,172
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no, no, no.

1266
01:39:28,192 --> 01:39:30,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Choo-choo, tangent train, pulling to the station.

1267
01:39:30,374 --> 01:39:31,474
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, this isn't a tangent train.

1268
01:39:31,494 --> 01:39:36,578
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually... There's another magical unicorn game that's on... No, don't get me wrong.

1269
01:39:36,618 --> 01:39:39,699
[SPEAKER_02]: I set a commercial for this because I watch Cartoon Network at Adult Swim sometimes.

1270
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:40,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1271
01:39:40,660 --> 01:39:43,102
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1272
01:40:09,707 --> 01:40:10,547
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1273
01:40:33,553 --> 01:40:41,497
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is still worth sharing, so thank you for the tweet because now it's penetrated like Yahoo and it's starting to get onto the mainstream sites about this copy protection.

1274
01:40:41,737 --> 01:40:45,659
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Robot Unicorn Attack is what the game's called.

1275
01:40:45,779 --> 01:40:50,121
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Secret of the Magic Crystals, Rob, is the one that you're looking for.

1276
01:40:50,561 --> 01:40:51,062
[SPEAKER_06]: is that it?

1277
01:40:51,542 --> 01:41:13,563
[SPEAKER_06]: it's also gone down to $6.99 oh wow that's a bargain hold on I just got a text message hold on I'm firing up my phone and the screenshot where you do crafting with a magic material called anus that's right one of the screenshots there's a magical crafting I don't know if it deleted his first text where he told me the name of the game but yeah that's the game what is that again?

1278
01:41:14,816 --> 01:41:16,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I just found the name.

1279
01:41:17,157 --> 01:41:18,418
[SPEAKER_09]: The Secret of the Magic Crystals.

1280
01:41:18,538 --> 01:41:19,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's it.

1281
01:41:19,718 --> 01:41:24,580
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a game about unicorns, and in one of those screens, if you look at one of those screenshots, okay, look, there, there.

1282
01:41:24,881 --> 01:41:29,402
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a crafting material on that screen called anus.

1283
01:41:30,023 --> 01:41:34,885
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look at it, one of the, like you have to collect anus, but it's A-E-N-U-S.

1284
01:41:36,434 --> 01:41:37,275
[SPEAKER_09]: A-E-N-U-S.

1285
01:41:37,315 --> 01:41:37,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there it is.

1286
01:41:39,658 --> 01:41:40,338
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pink.

1287
01:41:40,599 --> 01:41:43,462
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to collect all the pink anus you can.

1288
01:41:47,826 --> 01:41:48,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

1289
01:41:48,307 --> 01:41:49,528
[SPEAKER_15]: You know you want that game.

1290
01:41:51,850 --> 01:41:52,291
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck it.

1291
01:41:52,611 --> 01:41:53,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Add to cart.

1292
01:41:53,232 --> 01:41:53,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Reverse.

1293
01:41:53,933 --> 01:41:54,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you really?

1294
01:41:54,493 --> 01:41:55,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you buying the game?

1295
01:41:57,677 --> 01:41:59,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, I'm buying it for seven bucks.

1296
01:41:59,598 --> 01:42:00,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations, Alan.

1297
01:42:00,599 --> 01:42:00,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job.

1298
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:01,640
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1299
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:08,325
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will have a full review of the gay unicorn game, complete with anus and horn.

1300
01:42:08,445 --> 01:42:08,705
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1301
01:42:09,205 --> 01:42:11,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Let us know how the anus crafting goes a little later.

1302
01:42:12,185 --> 01:42:24,288
[SPEAKER_06]: This might need to be our next cause here on the show that we yell and scream for everybody to tweet and Facebook about is to get this on the consoles because I want some pink anus on my Xbox 360.

1303
01:42:24,728 --> 01:42:31,189
[SPEAKER_02]: This game apparently, the Robot Unicorn Attack or whatever, has a really interesting song that plays in the background.

1304
01:42:31,749 --> 01:42:34,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I haven't played it yet, but on the commercial it sounded funny.

1305
01:42:35,410 --> 01:43:01,647
[SPEAKER_06]: it's uh the chat room is uh it's erasure always oh yeah that was it yeah because i in fact i actually made a live journal post on this like a while back no i posted it on twitter hold on here's here's a little bit just so just so you have something to reference here loki this is the actual feel oh yeah yeah that's it

1306
01:43:03,783 --> 01:43:05,464
[SPEAKER_06]: This is actually one of my favorite Erasure songs.

1307
01:43:05,524 --> 01:43:07,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Erasure is a great synth-bop band.

1308
01:43:08,467 --> 01:43:11,029
[SPEAKER_11]: I love this one too.

1309
01:43:11,749 --> 01:43:13,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you play this game.

1310
01:43:14,291 --> 01:43:15,112
[SPEAKER_02]: To unicorns?

1311
01:43:15,252 --> 01:43:16,153
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.

1312
01:43:16,213 --> 01:43:19,575
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, to unicorns running and farting rainbows.

1313
01:43:19,615 --> 01:43:23,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go, Rob.

1314
01:43:23,959 --> 01:43:24,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.

1315
01:43:27,722 --> 01:43:30,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on, Loki's fired this up in studio.

1316
01:43:30,384 --> 01:43:31,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this a Flash game?

1317
01:43:31,765 --> 01:43:31,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1318
01:43:35,506 --> 01:43:44,733
[SPEAKER_06]: This is... Oh my god, your unicorn was all twisted in a big pile up in the ground.

1319
01:43:45,254 --> 01:43:46,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you post this link in chat, please?

1320
01:43:46,695 --> 01:43:47,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is so awesome.

1321
01:43:48,016 --> 01:43:49,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you post this link in chat?

1322
01:43:49,577 --> 01:43:49,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1323
01:43:50,038 --> 01:43:50,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

1324
01:43:51,639 --> 01:43:52,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe put it on the Twitter.

1325
01:43:52,780 --> 01:43:55,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you post it to the Twitter that we're talking about it on the show right now?

1326
01:43:55,642 --> 01:43:56,623
[SPEAKER_06]: You know the password and all that?

1327
01:43:57,223 --> 01:43:57,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1328
01:43:58,004 --> 01:43:58,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Please post that to the Twitter.

1329
01:43:59,045 --> 01:44:00,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I just downloaded a song.

1330
01:44:02,717 --> 01:44:03,958
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta sleep eventually, guys.

1331
01:44:27,213 --> 01:44:32,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Lastly, a tweet from Alex P. Carson wanting us to give a shout out to Alex Nicole.

1332
01:44:32,058 --> 01:44:33,039
[SPEAKER_06]: It's her first time listening.

1333
01:44:33,380 --> 01:44:33,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out.

1334
01:44:34,961 --> 01:44:35,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out!

1335
01:44:36,503 --> 01:44:39,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope she didn't turn it off after the farting rainbows chat.

1336
01:44:39,366 --> 01:44:40,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope we didn't scare her off.

1337
01:44:41,348 --> 01:44:41,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1338
01:44:43,110 --> 01:44:50,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, Amazed Shitsuma in chat, yes he changed his name, Amazed Shitsuma says Orange Lounge Unicornio is the new name of the show apparently.

1339
01:44:50,999 --> 01:44:52,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Who doesn't love unicorns?

1340
01:44:52,821 --> 01:44:53,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Like evil people.

1341
01:44:55,023 --> 01:44:55,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyhow.

1342
01:44:56,125 --> 01:45:02,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, I hate to interrupt you because I know you're running to the Twitter right now to post, but Loki can you give us some more gaming news here on OLRB.

1343
01:45:04,654 --> 01:45:05,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI

1344
01:45:21,552 --> 01:45:42,838
[SPEAKER_02]: and those of course have to do I guess with Abyssia and it's going to have a let's see here Vision of Abyssia I guess will come out during the summer with the other two Scars of Abyssia and Heroes of Abyssia coming soon after that and each new area can be purchased for $10 on the PlayOnlineViewer

1345
01:45:44,659 --> 01:45:47,201
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised that there's still expansions coming out to this.

1346
01:45:47,281 --> 01:45:49,362
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really sure what these new ballerinas are.

1347
01:45:50,083 --> 01:45:52,845
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is something that was added way after I left.

1348
01:45:53,665 --> 01:45:55,907
[SPEAKER_11]: I totally realized that I never finished my other Twitter topics.

1349
01:45:57,268 --> 01:45:57,708
[SPEAKER_06]: You never what?

1350
01:45:57,748 --> 01:45:59,129
[SPEAKER_11]: Not my Twitter topic, so rapid fire.

1351
01:45:59,509 --> 01:46:00,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then we'll come back to it in a moment here.

1352
01:46:00,949 --> 01:46:01,269
[SPEAKER_11]: It's fine.

1353
01:46:01,369 --> 01:46:02,430
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all right.

1354
01:46:02,930 --> 01:46:08,472
[SPEAKER_06]: But quickly, I wanted to say about Final Fantasy XI and its developments and what have you.

1355
01:46:10,092 --> 01:46:19,115
[SPEAKER_06]: This should kind of squelch those rumors that Final Fantasy XI is shutting down in a couple months to make room for XIV, which I always thought was a little bit ridiculous, how fast that spread like wildfire.

1356
01:46:19,175 --> 01:46:24,337
[SPEAKER_06]: But this, I'm sure, is in part to shut up those rumors that XI is still being supported.

1357
01:46:26,901 --> 01:46:28,181
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to fit in there, Shermie.

1358
01:46:29,142 --> 01:46:32,804
[SPEAKER_02]: What's Shermie trying to... Oh, Shermie's trying to... She's trying to poop on the mixing board.

1359
01:46:33,764 --> 01:46:34,204
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not working.

1360
01:46:34,224 --> 01:46:34,705
[SPEAKER_02]: She's trying.

1361
01:46:35,505 --> 01:46:36,546
[SPEAKER_06]: End the show, end the show.

1362
01:46:37,066 --> 01:46:37,306
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1363
01:46:37,906 --> 01:46:40,828
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a little more for us, Loki?

1364
01:46:41,028 --> 01:46:41,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1365
01:46:41,388 --> 01:46:48,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Final Fantasy XIV will be going into closed beta soon, actually, starting March 11th.

1366
01:46:49,312 --> 01:46:51,293
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe that they did have...

1367
01:46:54,475 --> 01:47:03,437
[SPEAKER_02]: The VanaFest, I guess, the 2010 website, which was some, they had some news, I guess, about Final Fantasy XI as well.

1368
01:47:03,938 --> 01:47:13,560
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the PlanetLine website, there's also interesting news, I guess, that the betas will start on March 11th.

1369
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:15,161
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I've already signed up for this.

1370
01:47:15,361 --> 01:47:16,561
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say I've already signed up for this.

1371
01:47:16,621 --> 01:47:19,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I signed up for it too, but my email box was empty.

1372
01:47:19,082 --> 01:47:21,482
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know about yours, but I saw that story and then I cried.

1373
01:47:21,502 --> 01:47:22,503
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't got anything yet either.

1374
01:47:22,663 --> 01:47:23,743
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, you know what?

1375
01:47:24,063 --> 01:47:26,404
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still time, so maybe.

1376
01:47:26,544 --> 01:47:29,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's one of those things where I won't be in the first wave, but maybe a later wave.

1377
01:47:29,584 --> 01:47:30,245
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be hopeful.

1378
01:47:30,545 --> 01:47:37,727
[SPEAKER_06]: But it gives me time to finish playing XIII because seriously, the beta for XIV is coming out two days after XIII.

1379
01:47:38,387 --> 01:47:40,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Two days between Final Fantasy titles in the U.S.

1380
01:47:40,967 --> 01:47:41,528
[SPEAKER_06]: if you think about it.

1381
01:47:41,628 --> 01:47:42,568
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of strange.

1382
01:47:43,288 --> 01:47:44,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and here's something else.

1383
01:47:44,169 --> 01:47:49,772
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think about it, if it's going into the beta now, maybe those May release dates are a little bit more accurate.

1384
01:47:50,172 --> 01:47:52,433
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know about May, but I bet the end of the year.

1385
01:47:53,514 --> 01:47:56,576
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like Final Fantasy XIV will be out by the end of the year, and that's kind of weird.

1386
01:47:56,996 --> 01:48:00,918
[SPEAKER_06]: I was not expecting it that soon, especially with XIII having taken as long as it did.

1387
01:48:01,719 --> 01:48:03,740
[SPEAKER_06]: So, pleasant surprise, I suppose.

1388
01:48:04,981 --> 01:48:05,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1389
01:48:05,361 --> 01:48:05,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1390
01:48:06,001 --> 01:48:11,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go over to Dark Sakura and whatever stories we skipped over because of all our discussions on unicorns.

1391
01:48:12,532 --> 01:48:13,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Unicorn farting.

1392
01:48:13,432 --> 01:48:16,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully it'll leak online just like BlazBlue did.

1393
01:48:35,484 --> 01:48:49,328
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there's an online Digimon battle game that's supposed to be coming out in the US that's a version of the Korean Digimon RPG, which I actually think I'll freaking play that because I love Digimon.

1394
01:48:50,802 --> 01:48:51,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Digimon Zero 2

1395
01:49:17,419 --> 01:49:37,110
[SPEAKER_09]: and um well a couple of movies and I have um like the first two volumes of it on of the Japanese version on DVD someone I used to date a long time ago just went on a couple dates with made me watch the Digimon movie I remember that it's you should watch the Japanese one that's why it didn't last you should watch the Japanese one it's actually really good is it

1396
01:49:37,390 --> 01:49:38,372
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I saw the English one

1397
01:49:53,471 --> 01:49:54,652
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1398
01:50:18,550 --> 01:50:46,945
[SPEAKER_06]: so they reach this little settlement well now Activision owns it because of all the acquisitions that go on and so forth and Activision has demanded that this game stop completely they're not honoring the old agreement they have demanded that this cease and desist immediately Phoenix Online has been doing this game since 2002 and then yeah so Activision has basically said even though they don't have plans on doing a sequel themselves by the way King's Quest is pretty much dead

1399
01:50:48,516 --> 01:50:49,657
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they should release it anyway.

1400
01:50:50,617 --> 01:50:51,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they don't want to get sued.

1401
01:50:51,938 --> 01:50:54,160
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can't say I necessarily blame them.

1402
01:50:54,340 --> 01:50:56,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Change the name and release it for free.

1403
01:50:56,922 --> 01:51:02,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, we actually, I believe we had one of the developers on the show many, many years ago.

1404
01:51:02,305 --> 01:51:07,349
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you'd have to go back to old, like the To Go podcast from 2005, 2006 to find this.

1405
01:51:07,369 --> 01:51:12,232
[SPEAKER_06]: But I want to say we had the guy on the show because I remember going to some virtual press conference online thing about it.

1406
01:51:12,672 --> 01:51:33,468
[SPEAKER_06]: and we also hosted a mirror of one of the early betas for the game I believe when it was still called King's Quest I think one of the big things they were touting if I remember right again this is like four or five years ago so please my memory is a little shoddy was that Roberta Williams actually knew of the project and although she couldn't officially give it her blessing she kind of gave it a wink and a nod you know what I mean

1407
01:51:34,369 --> 01:51:35,991
[SPEAKER_06]: We hosted the beta for this.

1408
01:51:36,933 --> 01:51:38,635
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't believe it went anywhere.

1409
01:51:38,695 --> 01:51:42,660
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it's still on our website at orangelaunchradio.com slash TSL.

1410
01:51:43,301 --> 01:51:43,982
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't get a letter.

1411
01:51:44,563 --> 01:51:46,645
[SPEAKER_06]: So, do you want to see what this is all about?

1412
01:51:47,106 --> 01:51:47,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Have fun!

1413
01:51:50,031 --> 01:52:18,839
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's kind of a douchey thing for Activision to do when they know they're not I realize they're in their rights to do it just like when Nintendo shut down the movie project the Zelda movie, we talked about this a couple months ago they were in their rights to do it but with Activision just having bought this saying they're not going to do anything with it but then putting the plug on this when they already stripped anything that was King's Quest related out of it that's just douchey Activision gets our douche of the week award there you go

1414
01:52:20,876 --> 01:52:46,925
[SPEAKER_06]: so I think that's unfortunate and you know my thought is I'm kind of with Jamie I say release it anyway as a torrent but if you're really afraid of getting the pantsuit off of you seriously go back change the name change some of the text change the characters nobody's gonna freaking know no Activision is not gonna seek it out that hardcore if you go in and change the information so it's hard to detect that it once was the silver lining I bet you you'll have it

1415
01:52:48,226 --> 01:52:48,587
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1416
01:52:49,088 --> 01:52:50,831
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm curious to see if the game gets leaked.

1417
01:52:50,871 --> 01:52:51,492
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet it does.

1418
01:52:51,693 --> 01:52:53,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Once it hits the internet, there is no going back.

1419
01:52:54,859 --> 01:52:55,259
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1420
01:52:56,442 --> 01:52:58,125
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what you have for us up next?

1421
01:52:59,844 --> 01:53:06,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, in other news, we have a game called Voice Fantasy.

1422
01:53:06,550 --> 01:53:09,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Square Enix has filed a trademark for it in Europe.

1423
01:53:10,974 --> 01:53:14,097
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe it could be a Final Fantasy vocal CD?

1424
01:53:14,437 --> 01:53:15,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe?

1425
01:53:16,859 --> 01:53:17,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

1426
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:19,341
[SPEAKER_09]: But it could be something cool.

1427
01:53:19,461 --> 01:53:20,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully it will be cool.

1428
01:53:21,763 --> 01:53:25,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it'll be like a SingStar Voice Fantasy or something, too.

1429
01:53:27,862 --> 01:53:31,365
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it could be a karaoke-controlled Final Fantasy 1, right?

1430
01:53:31,945 --> 01:53:35,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Or maybe one that you have to sing to progress your game or something.

1431
01:53:35,768 --> 01:53:36,749
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to fight!

1432
01:53:37,469 --> 01:53:38,810
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to cast holy!

1433
01:53:39,370 --> 01:53:42,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Or maybe you have to sing accurately to progress.

1434
01:53:43,693 --> 01:53:45,615
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you still playing the fucking Unicorn game?

1435
01:53:45,815 --> 01:53:46,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1436
01:53:48,036 --> 01:53:51,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Amaze Shitsuma in chat says, Douche of the Week award, so Shermie will poop on them.

1437
01:53:52,665 --> 01:53:58,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we give a big sure me poop award to the folks at Activision this week.

1438
01:53:58,033 --> 01:54:02,338
[SPEAKER_09]: The next time she takes a shit on the floor, I'll take a picture of it so we can just send it to whoever.

1439
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:04,141
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that idea.

1440
01:54:04,642 --> 01:54:05,303
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good idea.

1441
01:54:05,823 --> 01:54:08,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, put down the game and read some news for us.

1442
01:54:09,805 --> 01:54:10,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1443
01:54:11,566 --> 01:54:16,607
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this is not a big surprise because I don't think it's really taken off as far as I'm aware.

1444
01:54:17,148 --> 01:54:17,908
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation Home.

1445
01:54:18,548 --> 01:54:23,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently advertisers are ignoring PlayStation Home, but they are interested in the PlayStation Network.

1446
01:54:24,590 --> 01:54:33,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently a report coming from Brand Week saying that they're opting to pursue opportunities in Xbox Live instead.

1447
01:54:33,754 --> 01:54:37,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently ad agency, looks like a publicist,

1448
01:54:38,296 --> 01:54:55,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Dineo, John Rafferty, they told the website for the moment one it felt kind of clunky and once you got through that there wasn't much there regarding I guess the robotic nature of PlayStation Home.

1449
01:54:56,972 --> 01:55:21,482
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think it kind of makes sense because there's a lot of places to advertise in PlayStation Home but if you're like me, you don't use PlayStation Home so you're not seeing those ads so it makes more sense to put it on like say banner ads that are on the PlayStation Network or banner ads on the Xbox Live Marketplace because you're seeing those as you're going browsing for other things.

1450
01:55:22,262 --> 01:55:23,382
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you hit the nail on the head.

1451
01:55:23,943 --> 01:55:28,084
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no reason to go into PlayStation Home except when they launch something new.

1452
01:55:28,484 --> 01:55:31,985
[SPEAKER_06]: It's usually you go in there once and you go, oh, huh, and then that's it.

1453
01:55:32,285 --> 01:55:32,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Neat.

1454
01:55:32,925 --> 01:55:35,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like that, remember that salt that was on there?

1455
01:55:35,166 --> 01:55:35,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

1456
01:55:35,886 --> 01:55:36,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Went there once.

1457
01:55:37,206 --> 01:55:41,228
[SPEAKER_06]: I went in there a couple times and played it and got some of the little things and I was like, okay, done.

1458
01:55:42,308 --> 01:55:42,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1459
01:55:43,257 --> 01:55:44,720
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really want to pay for this.

1460
01:55:44,740 --> 01:55:48,205
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a souped up version of a game I played on my 386 computer back in 1993.

1461
01:55:48,265 --> 01:55:48,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really into it.

1462
01:55:59,248 --> 01:56:04,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, something that a lot of people are into is the idea of Nintendo starting over with a brand new Wii.

1463
01:56:04,590 --> 01:56:10,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it came out at the Nintendo Media Summit thanks to a GameSpot cornering Cammy Dunaway.

1464
01:56:11,392 --> 01:56:16,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, they say that there's not going to be a Wii successor anytime soon.

1465
01:56:17,254 --> 01:56:23,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently they're kind of looking for what happened with the PS2 is that they want to kind of re-emulate the fact that they're on top for years and years.

1466
01:56:24,737 --> 01:56:36,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Cammy Dunaway was quoted in the GameSpot interview saying, quote, even though our install base is at this point 5 million households larger than the PS2 install base was at the same point in the life cycle, it still has a lot of room to grow.

1467
01:56:36,760 --> 01:56:39,681
[SPEAKER_06]: If you think PS2, there's been about 50 million sold.

1468
01:56:40,081 --> 01:56:41,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii, close to 28 million sold.

1469
01:56:42,902 --> 01:57:01,327
[SPEAKER_06]: so it says to me there's still a big audience out there that we can access with the Wii so basically we still have sold shit loads of these systems so why would we start over with something new just because the core gamers are mad the soccer moms are happy so F you it's raining money at my world ha ha ha

1470
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:32,710
[SPEAKER_06]: so don't expect a new Wii to be announced at E3 this year but I think in great Nintendo fashion their way around this would be releasing the Wii HD or something along those lines where it's not necessarily a whole new system but it's a Wii Plus like the DS Lite or something like that that's what I could see Nintendo doing and then saying well it's still a Wii yeah I don't know we'll see

1471
01:57:33,624 --> 01:57:38,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyhow, we're going to get into that section of the show where we interact with your emails.

1472
01:57:38,488 --> 01:57:41,451
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the mailbag segment here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1473
01:57:42,512 --> 01:57:44,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Every week, DarkSakura opens up the mailbag.

1474
01:57:45,814 --> 01:57:49,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com That's all one word.

1475
01:57:49,357 --> 01:57:50,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag.

1476
01:57:50,138 --> 01:57:55,102
[SPEAKER_06]: M-A-I-L-B-A-G at OrangeLoungeRadio.com If you have an email you want DarkSakura to read.

1477
01:57:55,402 --> 01:57:58,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks like a lot of people took the opportunity this week, didn't they, DarkSakura?

1478
01:57:58,485 --> 01:57:58,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1479
01:57:58,965 --> 01:58:00,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, get to reading.

1480
01:58:01,437 --> 01:58:02,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, OLR Kardashians.

1481
01:58:03,118 --> 01:58:03,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1482
01:58:04,558 --> 01:58:08,199
[SPEAKER_09]: I just discovered that I could walk from where I live to Valve's headquarters.

1483
01:58:08,599 --> 01:58:08,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1484
01:58:09,380 --> 01:58:17,342
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a GameWorks in downtown Seattle that has BlazBlue, Street Fighter 4, Totsunoko vs. Capcom, King of Fighters 1 million, and a few pinball thingies.

1485
01:58:17,362 --> 01:58:20,003
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you ever are up there for PAX, I recommend stopping by.

1486
01:58:20,223 --> 01:58:20,723
[SPEAKER_06]: We went there.

1487
01:58:20,923 --> 01:58:21,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we did.

1488
01:58:21,383 --> 01:58:22,184
[SPEAKER_06]: We did stop by.

1489
01:58:23,084 --> 01:58:25,505
[SPEAKER_06]: They had that whole room of Sega cranes, right?

1490
01:58:25,525 --> 01:58:25,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1491
01:58:26,745 --> 01:58:27,445
[SPEAKER_09]: And I played a few.

1492
01:58:28,225 --> 01:58:31,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, since I'm entering high school, I was wondering if I should learn Japanese.

1493
01:58:31,406 --> 01:58:31,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it hard?

1494
01:58:32,546 --> 01:58:36,287
[SPEAKER_09]: I would kind of want to know what my important future is telling me.

1495
01:58:36,787 --> 01:58:39,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Typed with minor precision at 1240 AM, Austin.

1496
01:58:39,908 --> 01:58:42,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to let you know, Japanese is not an easy language.

1497
01:58:43,569 --> 01:58:48,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, because honestly I think the biggest difficulty in Japanese is the grammar.

1498
01:58:49,474 --> 01:58:51,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Not necessarily the vocabulary, but the grammar.

1499
01:58:52,275 --> 01:58:53,636
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little convoluted.

1500
01:58:53,857 --> 01:58:55,358
[SPEAKER_09]: I was a Japanese major for a little while.

1501
01:58:56,138 --> 01:59:01,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I know a few sites that will give you beginner lessons.

1502
01:59:01,062 --> 01:59:02,022
[SPEAKER_09]: You can find them for free.

1503
01:59:02,943 --> 01:59:05,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I think one is called iLearn or something.

1504
01:59:05,425 --> 01:59:09,047
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, just try a couple of those little online sites and see what you think.

1505
01:59:09,548 --> 01:59:12,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, I mean, it really is kind of a convoluted...

1506
01:59:13,230 --> 01:59:29,064
[SPEAKER_06]: in comparison to English it really depends on what industry you want to get into when you get older and maybe you're too young to know that now if you're just kind of like now going into high school which you're probably too young to listen to this show actually also depending on where you live because when I lived in Alabama it was good for me to know French

1507
01:59:29,850 --> 01:59:32,331
[SPEAKER_06]: And here in California, it's really good to know Spanish.

1508
01:59:32,871 --> 01:59:33,992
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really good to know it.

1509
01:59:34,092 --> 01:59:39,374
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's a lot of jobs out there where they really want bilingual people that speak Spanish.

1510
01:59:39,454 --> 01:59:40,874
[SPEAKER_06]: So you might want to think about that.

1511
01:59:40,934 --> 01:59:42,815
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, is Japanese really practical?

1512
01:59:43,195 --> 01:59:51,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if you want to get into an industry that has to do with technology and possibly relocating to Japan or working closely with Japanese business or finances.

1513
01:59:51,499 --> 01:59:52,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Or going into the JET program.

1514
01:59:52,779 --> 01:59:56,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, any of that, then yeah, Japanese is going to be a practical language to learn.

1515
01:59:57,284 --> 02:00:00,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, you might be a little young to really know what you want to do.

1516
02:00:00,268 --> 02:00:02,290
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was 15, I hadn't a clue.

1517
02:00:02,350 --> 02:00:03,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I did have a clue.

1518
02:00:03,312 --> 02:00:05,654
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to be a game show host, but that didn't quite pan out.

1519
02:00:07,136 --> 02:00:09,299
[SPEAKER_06]: I ended up changing my mind when I was like,

1520
02:00:09,699 --> 02:00:12,281
[SPEAKER_06]: I changed my major 8 times so don't even worry about it

1521
02:00:27,792 --> 02:00:29,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but I agree with Akuma JP.

1522
02:00:29,934 --> 02:00:30,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Do it while you're young.

1523
02:00:31,034 --> 02:00:33,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Learn a new language because it's much harder when you're older.

1524
02:00:33,716 --> 02:00:36,578
[SPEAKER_06]: And I tried to learn a second language in high school.

1525
02:00:36,678 --> 02:00:37,678
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried to learn Spanish.

1526
02:00:38,339 --> 02:00:45,343
[SPEAKER_06]: And unfortunately, this is going to sound terrible because I am a teacher of sorts even though I teach in a corporate environment as my day job.

1527
02:00:45,963 --> 02:01:05,107
[SPEAKER_06]: and I think teachers do great things but I had a Spanish teacher that was so terrible she actually ruined Spanish for me like I was not able to learn a language because this lady was so bad thankfully she's not teaching anymore she didn't she didn't keep teaching very long but it's unfortunate that that one person kind of screwed it up you know

1528
02:01:06,741 --> 02:01:07,121
[SPEAKER_09]: DDoS servers

1529
02:01:22,328 --> 02:01:27,232
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems to me like that would be the perfect target for a DDOS attack to cause maximum damage.

1530
02:01:27,612 --> 02:01:35,157
[SPEAKER_09]: A normal DDOS would only disrupt traffic, but an attack against Ubisoft servers would cause everyone's games to shut off and swamp their phone line.

1531
02:01:35,798 --> 02:01:38,319
[SPEAKER_09]: I was wondering what you guys thought about this problem.

1532
02:01:38,820 --> 02:01:45,585
[SPEAKER_09]: As a side question, I wanted to know what you guys thought about having a homebrew, no piracy, and tech-themed show on all games co-hosted by me and Jaded.

1533
02:01:47,586 --> 02:01:48,627
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, awesome show on the 22nd.

1534
02:01:49,628 --> 02:01:50,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Togek DDOS DDOS DDOS DDOS

1535
02:02:19,128 --> 02:02:19,548
[SPEAKER_06]: New Blood, Fresh Meat

1536
02:02:41,812 --> 02:02:55,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, I know they're open to having more ideas, and I know one thing that they don't want is they really don't want more general video game discussion shows, because they already have a lot of them, including us, admittedly, although we've been doing what we do a long time.

1537
02:02:56,505 --> 02:02:57,526
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think the idea of a niche...

1538
02:03:01,952 --> 02:03:10,845
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know of a show like that on all games unless I'm really behind on who's on the network right now.

1539
02:03:11,225 --> 02:03:15,011
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's always a good thing if you think of an idea for a show that no one's done yet.

1540
02:03:16,769 --> 02:03:21,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey OLR Crew, AZHP here again.

1541
02:03:21,453 --> 02:03:26,677
[SPEAKER_09]: I was listening live to your show on Sunday, though I wasn't in chat because I was putting together IKEA furniture at the time.

1542
02:03:27,878 --> 02:03:36,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, when I heard you all report on the Ubisoft DRM that requires you to be on the internet constantly in order to play Assassin's Creed 2, my first thought was, are Ubisoft insane?

1543
02:03:36,865 --> 02:03:38,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Do they want people to pirate their game?

1544
02:03:38,547 --> 02:03:42,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Because honestly, once it's cracked, the pirate versions will actually be better than a retail copy.

1545
02:03:43,188 --> 02:03:43,709
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1546
02:03:59,185 --> 02:04:27,300
[SPEAKER_09]: someone obviously dropped the ball here and is completely out of touch with gamers I was going to buy Assassin's Creed 2 but after hearing about this I don't think I will anymore now I don't think I'm going to pirate it since I'm not really interested in the game but doesn't it seem like Ubisoft is actually encouraging people to pirate the game so they won't have to deal with that DRM yours truly is HP I just think they're stupid I really have no comment I agree with your email 100% I really have nothing else to say I think what you say is absolutely valid it's just encouraging piracy

1547
02:04:29,079 --> 02:04:58,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, next email It's kind of a cool email Hey OLR gang, a quick question here I'm a techie very much like yourselves and I have a few electronics in the house However, it's starting to become a problem as I have a few wires just dangling and crossing under my gaming desk My Wii, Xbox 360, computer setup all share the same space Do you have any personal home solutions or recommendations for organizing an otherwise jungle of wires as well as saving me the time and money in the long run eliminating a potential fire hazard Randy from Texas I do, I have a lot of suggestions because we do them

1548
02:05:00,272 --> 02:05:02,353
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get a switch box, first of all, for your systems.

1549
02:05:02,873 --> 02:05:05,735
[SPEAKER_09]: You can also, what we do in the studio is we have zip ties.

1550
02:05:06,915 --> 02:05:07,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Although we don't really use them anymore.

1551
02:05:08,836 --> 02:05:15,840
[SPEAKER_09]: But we have zip ties for our cables for our mics and for the plugs and various hookups.

1552
02:05:16,300 --> 02:05:18,041
[SPEAKER_09]: That way we can minimize what's there to trip over.

1553
02:05:18,061 --> 02:05:25,385
[SPEAKER_09]: You can also get, I believe you can get them at Fry's or any electronic store or computer store or just in general.

1554
02:05:25,405 --> 02:05:26,446
[SPEAKER_09]: You can actually buy them online.

1555
02:05:26,927 --> 02:05:27,350
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1556
02:05:30,464 --> 02:05:35,466
[SPEAKER_09]: They look like the plastic ring binders that go on presentation books and stuff.

1557
02:05:36,007 --> 02:05:42,009
[SPEAKER_09]: But you bind your cords together and wrap them around your cords and then it leaves them as a long trail.

1558
02:05:42,490 --> 02:05:44,270
[SPEAKER_09]: You can also duct tape them to the floor.

1559
02:05:44,711 --> 02:05:45,731
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, seriously.

1560
02:05:46,972 --> 02:05:49,893
[SPEAKER_09]: You can use electrical tape to bind them together too.

1561
02:05:49,993 --> 02:05:56,516
[SPEAKER_09]: My computer actually, when we put in my card, my new graphics card, we actually just...

1562
02:05:57,476 --> 02:06:00,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Electrical taped all the bonus wires together.

1563
02:06:00,399 --> 02:06:02,662
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's lots of stuff that you can do.

1564
02:06:03,262 --> 02:06:06,726
[SPEAKER_09]: And really, you can get almost any of these things really cheap.

1565
02:06:06,766 --> 02:06:07,667
[SPEAKER_09]: You can buy twist ties.

1566
02:06:07,707 --> 02:06:09,128
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get leftover twist ties.

1567
02:06:09,148 --> 02:06:11,731
[SPEAKER_06]: These little zippy ties we use in the studio or at the 99 cent store, right?

1568
02:06:11,831 --> 02:06:11,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1569
02:06:11,971 --> 02:06:13,813
[SPEAKER_09]: I bought a pack of eight of them for a dollar.

1570
02:06:15,114 --> 02:06:17,235
[SPEAKER_09]: You just have to look around.

1571
02:06:17,595 --> 02:06:23,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Really, the thing that you want to do is find something that's going to be non-flammable, something that can bind them together.

1572
02:06:24,058 --> 02:06:36,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, if you want something that's going to hold them securely, your best bet, get a switch box or if you have multiple hookups to your TV, I would get electrical tape and bind the ones to each specific system together.

1573
02:06:36,825 --> 02:06:43,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, if you leave them at the right length for your binding, you can, if you need to transport them, just unplug them and move them easily.

1574
02:06:43,968 --> 02:07:03,131
[SPEAKER_06]: and labels go a long freaking way even though you might be thinking oh what a pain in the butt or you know they're so silly if you just like label your wires at both ends oh my god you will be so happy later if you ever have to move if you use the electrical tape method just get a sharpie right on the electrical tape yeah PS3 you know it's very easy

1575
02:07:03,331 --> 02:07:06,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you've seen the box of cables that we have, Rob, obviously.

1576
02:07:07,033 --> 02:07:17,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Where it's like you sort of have to look at the end and guess what it is and be afraid if you happen to find an N64 or a Super Nintendo thing because they use the same ones, practically.

1577
02:07:19,279 --> 02:07:27,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Or if you happen to accidentally hook up your Japanese PlayStation 2 adapter and then realize it won't fit in your US one.

1578
02:07:28,383 --> 02:07:29,884
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just going off because...

1579
02:07:30,624 --> 02:07:39,778
[SPEAKER_09]: it really does help of course we have big bins now in the vault where we keep all of that and don't know which one's which tape

1580
02:07:41,935 --> 02:07:42,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Also for speaker cables.

1581
02:07:43,436 --> 02:07:43,876
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just saying.

1582
02:07:45,037 --> 02:07:48,299
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get these plastic pieces.

1583
02:07:48,779 --> 02:07:51,861
[SPEAKER_09]: For example, we have our surround sound wired.

1584
02:07:52,682 --> 02:07:55,384
[SPEAKER_09]: And we didn't wire it under the floor or anything yet.

1585
02:07:56,284 --> 02:07:57,565
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is something I wanted to do.

1586
02:07:57,585 --> 02:07:58,226
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't done it yet.

1587
02:07:58,266 --> 02:08:02,368
[SPEAKER_09]: But you can get these plastic strips that you can adhere to the floor.

1588
02:08:02,469 --> 02:08:04,870
[SPEAKER_09]: They use them in office buildings.

1589
02:08:06,031 --> 02:08:10,354
[SPEAKER_09]: To keep you from tripping over wires that happen to be spread for your speakers and whatnot.

1590
02:08:11,894 --> 02:08:12,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Good suggestions.

1591
02:08:13,375 --> 02:08:14,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you can find us anywhere.

1592
02:08:14,555 --> 02:08:18,977
[SPEAKER_09]: Just make sure that you get something that's, you know, electronic safe and fire safe.

1593
02:08:20,737 --> 02:08:21,197
[SPEAKER_06]: More emails?

1594
02:08:22,278 --> 02:08:22,618
[SPEAKER_09]: One more.

1595
02:08:23,258 --> 02:08:24,078
[SPEAKER_09]: It's long.

1596
02:08:24,098 --> 02:08:25,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay, long email.

1597
02:08:26,379 --> 02:08:27,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Long email is long.

1598
02:08:28,740 --> 02:08:29,840
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't stop playing this.

1599
02:08:31,040 --> 02:08:32,321
[SPEAKER_06]: You're still playing the Magic Unicorn game, huh?

1600
02:08:32,341 --> 02:08:33,941
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to have erasure stuck in my head.

1601
02:08:34,001 --> 02:08:35,562
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to be having nightmares about erasure.

1602
02:08:37,045 --> 02:08:37,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello there, OLR.

1603
02:08:37,845 --> 02:08:40,066
[SPEAKER_09]: This is G-Ditz writing in.

1604
02:08:40,146 --> 02:08:55,631
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the Swedish dude who called a few shows ago and talked about DRM and seeing as exams are closing in, I can't really spare the time to attend the next live show, so I figured I'd answer the call for European to write about it, the high piracy rate over here, and what might be the cause of it.

1605
02:08:56,671 --> 02:09:05,018
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have a lot of insight on how game releases or pricing works in Italy, where the highest rate of piracy occurred according to the study presented in last week's show.

1606
02:09:05,539 --> 02:09:11,984
[SPEAKER_09]: I do, however, live in Sweden, where the famous Pirate Bay BitTorrent site was founded, and where piracy is also frequent.

1607
02:09:13,786 --> 02:09:17,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Now there are quite a few factors as to why I have many times been tempted to pirate.

1608
02:09:17,907 --> 02:09:18,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Release.

1609
02:09:18,927 --> 02:09:24,368
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the biggest factors is for me whether or not I can purchase a product legally.

1610
02:09:25,428 --> 02:09:33,250
[SPEAKER_09]: When it comes to anime, for example, there usually isn't a retailer around here to supply them, and if there is, it's all dubbed or subbed in Swedish, which isn't how I like my anime.

1611
02:09:33,550 --> 02:09:35,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Agreed, I hate most English dubs.

1612
02:09:37,211 --> 02:09:38,671
[SPEAKER_09]: I like watching them in Japanese with subtitles.

1613
02:09:39,375 --> 02:09:49,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Another annoying thing is that the delay between US release and the European one, it's usually a week or just a few days, but once in a while a game takes almost a full year to get over here.

1614
02:09:49,843 --> 02:09:52,065
[SPEAKER_09]: One example is Rock Band 2 with the instrument bundle.

1615
02:09:52,666 --> 02:09:56,549
[SPEAKER_09]: At the time of its release, I didn't have any rhythm hardware for my PS3 and was stuck with a hard decision.

1616
02:09:56,989 --> 02:09:58,090
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1617
02:10:23,989 --> 02:10:29,740
[SPEAKER_09]: As a side effect of this, I now despise Harmonix a bit for not being able to ship hardware in a reasonable amount of time.

1618
02:10:32,708 --> 02:10:57,299
[SPEAKER_09]: DRM DRM isn't different for us Europeans but it's still something to consider when buying a product even more if you want to lend it to a friend install it several times or just be able to play it without an internet connection the worst DRM I have to deal with on a daily basis is a CAD computer aided design program used for making mechanical parts and design requires not only a constant online connection but also requires said connection to go through the school network

1619
02:10:57,980 --> 02:10:59,885
[SPEAKER_09]: We're using AutoCAD?

1620
02:11:05,947 --> 02:11:11,730
[SPEAKER_09]: This means I have to VPN to the school network at all times when using said software.

1621
02:11:12,070 --> 02:11:17,232
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't even imagine how such extreme restrictions would urge people to buy it when a pirated copy would mean a lot less hassle.

1622
02:11:18,113 --> 02:11:18,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Cost.

1623
02:11:19,133 --> 02:11:24,496
[SPEAKER_09]: This is one of the biggest hurdles for many people, myself included, and it goes a bit beyond what Americans have to go through.

1624
02:11:24,696 --> 02:11:31,639
[SPEAKER_09]: From what I gather, a new retail game over in the US costs about $60, which would be the equivalent of $450 Swedish kronor.

1625
02:11:34,620 --> 02:11:43,068
[SPEAKER_09]: However, we have a value-added tax for each and every item we purchase in stores, where the rate for any item can be 612 or even 25% added to the price.

1626
02:11:43,729 --> 02:11:47,672
[SPEAKER_09]: In short, a video game costs a Swedish person 600 kronors, which is the equivalent of $80.

1627
02:11:47,732 --> 02:11:55,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if I know the tax goes to education, government funding, and healthcare, it still leaves a big hole in my wallet every time I buy a video game.

1628
02:11:56,926 --> 02:11:57,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Summary.

1629
02:11:57,847 --> 02:12:02,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully this letter gave you guys a better image of what gaming and the gamer lifestyle is like across the sea.

1630
02:12:03,570 --> 02:12:11,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if we sometimes get treated as less important market, we still like to support our favorite developers and actually pay for games we enjoy.

1631
02:12:12,375 --> 02:12:16,817
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have any more questions, I'd be happy to answer them when I get the time, but for now I have to get back to studying.

1632
02:12:17,197 --> 02:12:17,878
[SPEAKER_09]: GDits out.

1633
02:12:18,838 --> 02:12:20,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Good luck with your exams, by the way.

1634
02:12:20,258 --> 02:12:21,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, good email.

1635
02:12:21,739 --> 02:12:29,420
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a little sad, though, that it didn't come from one of the countries that was really high on the list, because I don't recall Sweden being in the top ten.

1636
02:12:29,440 --> 02:12:31,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I do appreciate Sweden very much.

1637
02:12:32,180 --> 02:12:33,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Without them, we would not have ABBA.

1638
02:12:34,361 --> 02:12:35,381
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know what I mean, seriously.

1639
02:12:36,281 --> 02:12:37,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Good email, otherwise, though.

1640
02:12:37,741 --> 02:12:39,982
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always good to hear different perspectives from around the world.

1641
02:12:40,042 --> 02:12:41,142
[SPEAKER_09]: I found the other email, by the way.

1642
02:12:41,362 --> 02:12:41,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, goody.

1643
02:12:41,882 --> 02:12:43,523
[SPEAKER_09]: From our buddy, Robaba.

1644
02:12:44,143 --> 02:12:45,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I haven't heard from him in a while.

1645
02:12:45,323 --> 02:12:45,983
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope he's doing well.

1646
02:12:46,451 --> 02:12:48,993
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure the trailers for Super Mario Galaxy 2 will be plentiful.

1647
02:12:49,093 --> 02:12:51,755
[SPEAKER_09]: I noticed that the little starbursts don't say you're Mr. Gay anymore.

1648
02:12:52,176 --> 02:12:53,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Now they say you're my gay.

1649
02:12:53,617 --> 02:12:55,458
[SPEAKER_09]: That's almost sweet in its own way.

1650
02:12:58,821 --> 02:12:59,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Rob.

1651
02:12:59,561 --> 02:12:59,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1652
02:13:00,682 --> 02:13:01,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

1653
02:13:01,203 --> 02:13:02,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Rob-a-ba-ba.

1654
02:13:03,264 --> 02:13:03,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate it.

1655
02:13:04,444 --> 02:13:10,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and yeah, also we got a random voice V-text, even though we've covered this, I'll go ahead and say it.

1656
02:13:10,307 --> 02:13:10,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1657
02:13:10,807 --> 02:13:17,590
[SPEAKER_09]: From, um, I don't want to say the person's name, I'll just say from Sumiragawa-san.

1658
02:13:18,210 --> 02:13:21,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Three new characters have been announced for Super Street Fighter 4, Ibuki, Makoto, and Deadly.

1659
02:13:21,552 --> 02:13:22,272
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we've covered it.

1660
02:13:22,492 --> 02:13:24,413
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if that was sent during the show last week.

1661
02:13:24,453 --> 02:13:24,973
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet it was.

1662
02:13:25,113 --> 02:13:25,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably.

1663
02:13:25,613 --> 02:13:26,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there you go.

1664
02:13:26,533 --> 02:13:27,634
[SPEAKER_09]: But I still wanted to read it.

1665
02:13:27,674 --> 02:13:28,674
[SPEAKER_09]: It was short, and why not?

1666
02:13:28,834 --> 02:13:29,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

1667
02:13:29,574 --> 02:13:30,555
[SPEAKER_06]: We like to read our emails.

1668
02:13:30,615 --> 02:13:34,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send emails.

1669
02:13:34,256 --> 02:13:34,936
[SPEAKER_06]: We like emails.

1670
02:13:34,976 --> 02:13:36,016
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully we'll get some more.

1671
02:13:36,916 --> 02:13:44,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Meantime, let's do our FUs of the week, because good lord, we have no shortage of angst this week after all these Activision stories we're hearing.

1672
02:13:44,579 --> 02:13:48,000
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we all know who's getting this dedication tonight.

1673
02:14:03,271 --> 02:14:09,333
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give you a hint, his name is Bobby and I'm not talking about the always awesome Bobby Blackwolf.

1674
02:14:09,993 --> 02:14:10,613
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

1675
02:14:11,393 --> 02:14:13,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, well, okay, fuck Activision, whatever.

1676
02:14:14,654 --> 02:14:19,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, fuck Shermie's poop for sticking up the house.

1677
02:14:20,056 --> 02:14:22,717
[SPEAKER_09]: I seriously have no idea what the hell is up with my damn cat.

1678
02:14:24,181 --> 02:14:26,082
[SPEAKER_09]: She's only started doing this in the last month.

1679
02:14:26,182 --> 02:14:27,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Just pooping.

1680
02:14:27,763 --> 02:14:28,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Randomly.

1681
02:14:28,363 --> 02:14:29,863
[SPEAKER_09]: She'll use her box, don't get me wrong.

1682
02:14:30,264 --> 02:14:34,926
[SPEAKER_09]: And then she'll be like, Oh, by the way, Mom, I have left you a little brown present in front of the bathroom.

1683
02:14:36,686 --> 02:14:44,870
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um... F you to stomach problems that kept me from going to the Purim spiel last night.

1684
02:14:45,970 --> 02:14:49,652
[SPEAKER_09]: I was looking forward to my first Purim, but I hurt myself.

1685
02:14:51,141 --> 02:14:51,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe another time.

1686
02:14:52,521 --> 02:14:54,522
[SPEAKER_05]: We're sorry, but our Purin is in another castle.

1687
02:14:56,422 --> 02:14:56,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki!

1688
02:14:57,982 --> 02:15:13,026
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to people that find it necessary to stop their car a good four or five car lengths behind the other car that's in front of them, preventing you from going around them because they're douchebags.

1689
02:15:13,266 --> 02:15:18,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only that, they kind of drive slow or take turns really wide or take turns really slow.

1690
02:15:18,867 --> 02:15:19,647
[SPEAKER_02]: So F you to bad drivers.

1691
02:15:22,273 --> 02:15:24,515
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really have a lot of FUs, to be honest.

1692
02:15:25,175 --> 02:15:28,637
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm relatively in a good mood, all things considered, but FU to moving.

1693
02:15:28,677 --> 02:15:30,358
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just been the one thing that's been on my mind.

1694
02:15:30,538 --> 02:15:35,921
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be so happy that next week it will be over and we can get on to other things like Final Fantasy XIII.

1695
02:15:35,941 --> 02:15:39,063
[SPEAKER_01]: One more, one more.

1696
02:15:40,484 --> 02:15:41,184
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you don't have to play the music.

1697
02:15:41,204 --> 02:15:41,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I gotta go.

1698
02:15:41,925 --> 02:15:42,605
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to play it.

1699
02:15:42,625 --> 02:15:43,486
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't have to play the music.

1700
02:15:43,506 --> 02:15:43,906
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.

1701
02:15:44,046 --> 02:15:44,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Sims 3.

1702
02:15:44,286 --> 02:15:47,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are you giving an FU to your favorite game or one of them?

1703
02:15:47,794 --> 02:15:48,916
[SPEAKER_08]: because it's not loading.

1704
02:15:49,557 --> 02:15:50,498
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's because of my mod.

1705
02:15:51,420 --> 02:15:57,569
[SPEAKER_06]: I mentioned it in part A. A couple more news stories for you guys and then the Skype line.

1706
02:15:58,090 --> 02:16:01,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Brace yourselves, it's always an adventure where every gamer has a voice.

1707
02:16:02,658 --> 02:16:05,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Monster Hunter Tri is coming out April 20th.

1708
02:16:06,601 --> 02:16:12,245
[SPEAKER_02]: It will also be available in a bundle with the Classic Controller Pro.

1709
02:16:12,265 --> 02:16:15,227
[SPEAKER_02]: The Classic Controller with the extra little grips on them.

1710
02:16:17,108 --> 02:16:20,670
[SPEAKER_02]: That bundle will be available for $60 whereas the game will be just $49.99.

1711
02:16:23,232 --> 02:16:37,469
[SPEAKER_02]: GameStop will be offering demo discs starting March 8th for those who pre-order and also those who pre-order will get themselves a card for 500 Wii Points, so basically $5 back.

1712
02:16:38,570 --> 02:17:07,217
[SPEAKER_02]: but not only that the online play will actually be free to play as opposed to what's in Japan where you actually have to pay to play the game so it'll actually be free to play online which I'm sure is very happy news for fans of the Monster Hunter series I don't know it's neat looking that's happy news for anybody free is awesome no one likes to pay for stuff anyways

1713
02:17:08,715 --> 02:17:09,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes you have to.

1714
02:17:09,717 --> 02:17:10,919
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how society works.

1715
02:17:11,601 --> 02:17:12,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1716
02:17:13,364 --> 02:17:14,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn commerce.

1717
02:17:16,744 --> 02:17:27,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, one more story for you guys and then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio and that has to do with the teaser trailer that was released this week.

1718
02:17:29,568 --> 02:17:34,470
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a new teaser trailer that just hit the internet for Pac-Man Battle Royale.

1719
02:17:34,550 --> 02:17:38,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it looks like that early trademark that was discovered is true.

1720
02:17:38,751 --> 02:17:42,072
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a new Pac-Man game coming out and it's called Battle Royale.

1721
02:17:42,572 --> 02:17:44,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Outside of that, what else is this game about?

1722
02:17:44,933 --> 02:17:48,715
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know because this is probably the worst teaser trailer I've ever seen in my life.

1723
02:17:48,815 --> 02:17:49,995
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 13 seconds.

1724
02:17:50,095 --> 02:17:50,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Ready?

1725
02:17:50,396 --> 02:17:50,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Here it is.

1726
02:17:51,316 --> 02:17:52,556
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the Namco logo.

1727
02:17:52,937 --> 02:17:55,798
[SPEAKER_06]: And then... Oh, yes.

1728
02:17:55,878 --> 02:17:56,538
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that noise.

1729
02:17:56,578 --> 02:17:57,339
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Pac-Man.

1730
02:17:58,639 --> 02:17:59,419
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the logo.

1731
02:18:00,120 --> 02:18:00,520
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

1732
02:18:00,680 --> 02:18:02,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Sneak peek at Amusement Expo 2010.

1733
02:18:02,361 --> 02:18:04,562
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the whole teaser right there.

1734
02:18:04,742 --> 02:18:05,842
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't tease anything.

1735
02:18:07,483 --> 02:18:08,824
[SPEAKER_06]: We already kind of knew about the game.

1736
02:18:08,884 --> 02:18:09,484
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a tease.

1737
02:18:09,684 --> 02:18:12,405
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to tease you and let you think that we've given you a teaser.

1738
02:18:12,665 --> 02:18:13,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, tease.

1739
02:18:13,666 --> 02:18:13,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?

1740
02:18:15,549 --> 02:18:42,483
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can see at least on the logo that there are four different colored Pac-Mans There's a yellow, a red, a pink, and a blue Kind of like the ghosts in a weird way Although I believe one of the ghosts is orange, not yellow, but still It's chasing a ghost But they are chasing a ghost So maybe it's some type of multiplayer Pac-Man CE That seems to be the popular thought as to what this is all about Plus they are showing this at the Amusement Expo 2010 So the thought is, hmm, arcade game?

1741
02:18:44,624 --> 02:18:45,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Arcade Games

1742
02:19:13,700 --> 02:19:14,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey Rob, this is Footy Monster.

1743
02:19:15,061 --> 02:19:16,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey Footy Monster, how are you?

1744
02:19:17,864 --> 02:19:19,606
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh man, I tell you it's been a couple of days.

1745
02:19:20,426 --> 02:19:25,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Now for those that don't know, Footy Monster is one of our listeners who lives quite a distance away.

1746
02:19:25,831 --> 02:19:27,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Where do you live, Footy Monster, for those new to the show?

1747
02:19:28,634 --> 02:19:30,055
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm in Chile right now.

1748
02:19:31,257 --> 02:19:35,000
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's the big place that's on the news lately because of an earthquake.

1749
02:19:35,240 --> 02:19:36,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we've heard about it.

1750
02:19:36,401 --> 02:19:37,903
[SPEAKER_06]: And where exactly in Chile are you?

1751
02:19:38,584 --> 02:19:41,966
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm actually in Santiago, like in one of the major cities that was hit by it.

1752
02:19:42,467 --> 02:19:46,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, but you're calling into the show, so your internet's working.

1753
02:19:46,369 --> 02:19:47,290
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, is everything cool?

1754
02:19:47,310 --> 02:19:49,952
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, my internet was working before my phone worked.

1755
02:19:50,492 --> 02:19:50,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1756
02:19:50,572 --> 02:19:51,232
[SPEAKER_13]: It was crazy.

1757
02:19:51,533 --> 02:19:52,633
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't understand how that happened.

1758
02:19:52,673 --> 02:19:59,518
[SPEAKER_13]: The first thing I could do to tell like my mother in Argentina and like my friends and stuff that I was okay was through Facebook.

1759
02:20:00,339 --> 02:20:00,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1760
02:20:00,639 --> 02:20:01,399
[SPEAKER_13]: It was the weirdest thing.

1761
02:20:01,679 --> 02:20:01,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1762
02:20:02,640 --> 02:20:05,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-oh, this kind of leads into that whole talk we were having about social networking.

1763
02:20:06,002 --> 02:20:06,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you hear that?

1764
02:20:06,442 --> 02:20:09,584
[SPEAKER_11]: But didn't I say that there are legitimate reasons and then there's just the crap?

1765
02:20:09,764 --> 02:20:12,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, but it's still interesting in this context.

1766
02:20:12,746 --> 02:20:18,889
[SPEAKER_13]: Honestly, in that context, the first click I did was to hit submit to say I'm okay.

1767
02:20:19,269 --> 02:20:21,910
[SPEAKER_13]: DJ Ranma's idea that I call in to let people know in case they hadn't heard but

1768
02:20:43,516 --> 02:20:44,196
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's good to know.

1769
02:20:44,236 --> 02:20:45,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you still doing a regular show?

1770
02:20:45,637 --> 02:20:49,020
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you used to do the role-playing show, but I think you guys put that on hold, right?

1771
02:20:49,441 --> 02:20:56,968
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, well, I moved here to Chile last year, and I had to put it on hold because of work and not knowing my schedule and stuff.

1772
02:20:57,448 --> 02:20:59,790
[SPEAKER_13]: So I didn't put it on hold myself.

1773
02:21:00,170 --> 02:21:05,775
[SPEAKER_13]: I gave the show, like the reins of it, to one of the co-hosts, and he decided to put it on hold indefinitely.

1774
02:21:05,856 --> 02:21:06,616
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's that.

1775
02:21:07,717 --> 02:21:13,404
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, I've been, like, about two weeks ago I was guesting on Video Game News Radio.

1776
02:21:13,824 --> 02:21:14,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, fun.

1777
02:21:14,865 --> 02:21:17,548
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, I was there if you care to listen to my musings.

1778
02:21:17,788 --> 02:21:19,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Are those the guys in Cleveland?

1779
02:21:19,370 --> 02:21:20,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Or am I mixing my shows up?

1780
02:21:20,291 --> 02:21:20,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they are.

1781
02:21:20,752 --> 02:21:21,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1782
02:21:21,172 --> 02:21:21,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.

1783
02:21:21,513 --> 02:21:21,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1784
02:21:21,973 --> 02:21:22,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

1785
02:21:22,774 --> 02:21:25,357
[SPEAKER_06]: They're the other guys that have been doing a show forever.

1786
02:21:25,557 --> 02:21:26,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I think they've been on about as long as we have.

1787
02:21:26,778 --> 02:21:28,480
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, they've been doing this show as long as you guys have.

1788
02:21:28,520 --> 02:21:29,001
[SPEAKER_06]: It's crazy.

1789
02:21:29,021 --> 02:21:29,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1790
02:21:29,221 --> 02:21:29,702
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.

1791
02:21:29,722 --> 02:21:31,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a very different show than us.

1792
02:21:32,726 --> 02:21:40,999
[SPEAKER_06]: You must have been calling in to talk about Halo 3 or some of the shooter games, or the Call of Duty type stuff.

1793
02:21:41,780 --> 02:21:44,263
[SPEAKER_06]: That's more the type of stuff they get into, right?

1794
02:21:44,944 --> 02:21:49,047
[SPEAKER_13]: The best thing that they do is when they talk about nothing that's related to video games, honestly.

1795
02:21:49,067 --> 02:21:54,910
[SPEAKER_13]: They just go on rants about how one of them is a trucker, the other one is, you know, out of a job, and it's hilarious.

1796
02:21:54,930 --> 02:21:55,270
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1797
02:21:55,550 --> 02:21:59,513
[SPEAKER_06]: How interesting that that would be the interesting part of their show, too.

1798
02:21:59,953 --> 02:22:01,454
[SPEAKER_13]: Honestly, they actually had a spin-off.

1799
02:22:01,514 --> 02:22:07,997
[SPEAKER_13]: They have a spin-off show that they called Midwest Wasteland, I believe the name, and that's all they talk about.

1800
02:22:08,017 --> 02:22:12,700
[SPEAKER_13]: They just said, you know what, we're going to scrap the video game part of it and just go with what people actually like.

1801
02:22:13,561 --> 02:22:14,161
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's pretty funny.

1802
02:22:14,361 --> 02:22:23,266
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting you bring up spinoff shows, because, you know, Jamie was doing a comic podcast for a while, and I know she had to put that on hold, but there might be other spinoff shows in the works.

1803
02:22:23,286 --> 02:22:25,587
[SPEAKER_06]: You never know what might be coming, so stay tuned.

1804
02:22:26,307 --> 02:22:28,608
[SPEAKER_13]: So, yeah, you know, I just wanted to call in about that.

1805
02:22:29,089 --> 02:22:33,511
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't get heard more than, you know, Scraps, Bruces, that kind of thing from...

1806
02:22:34,051 --> 02:22:37,394
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, moving debris and stuff because one of our walls actually came down.

1807
02:22:37,574 --> 02:22:37,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.

1808
02:22:38,415 --> 02:22:42,518
[SPEAKER_13]: That separates our wall, like our house from the neighbors and it fell down on our cars.

1809
02:22:43,019 --> 02:22:43,719
[SPEAKER_13]: Oof.

1810
02:22:44,059 --> 02:22:46,742
[SPEAKER_13]: So, our cars are now, like, you know, they're covering rubble and...

1811
02:22:47,304 --> 02:22:49,085
[SPEAKER_13]: Now they need to be repaired and stuff.

1812
02:22:49,146 --> 02:22:51,507
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember Jamie had a wall fall on her car and it wasn't even an earthquake.

1813
02:22:51,527 --> 02:22:52,108
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just about to say that.

1814
02:22:52,128 --> 02:22:53,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I remember that happening.

1815
02:22:53,409 --> 02:22:55,711
[SPEAKER_09]: It was at my old apartment complex.

1816
02:22:55,771 --> 02:23:01,796
[SPEAKER_09]: We had this sort of stucco and brick wall that was around the dumpster.

1817
02:23:02,576 --> 02:23:06,820
[SPEAKER_09]: And we had that windstorm and the wall actually fell over on the car.

1818
02:23:06,840 --> 02:23:07,300
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, yeah.

1819
02:23:07,921 --> 02:23:11,143
[SPEAKER_09]: And it just dented one ridge on it from where it impacted.

1820
02:23:11,183 --> 02:23:16,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Thankfully, the car was still drivable, although it looked like just an ugly thing.

1821
02:23:17,088 --> 02:23:18,889
[SPEAKER_13]: But a car is just a car.

1822
02:23:19,329 --> 02:23:20,189
[SPEAKER_06]: A car is just a car.

1823
02:23:20,369 --> 02:23:20,849
[SPEAKER_06]: It's replaced.

1824
02:23:20,869 --> 02:23:23,250
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's the only thing I can be thankful of.

1825
02:23:23,310 --> 02:23:28,812
[SPEAKER_13]: Although, I don't know, you guys are in California, so you kind of are used to the earth shaking, I suppose.

1826
02:23:28,852 --> 02:23:29,812
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not in Sacramento so much.

1827
02:23:29,832 --> 02:23:32,813
[SPEAKER_06]: The place we live is not nearly as bad with the earthquakes.

1828
02:23:32,873 --> 02:23:35,394
[SPEAKER_06]: We've felt a few, but they're usually not that bad.

1829
02:23:35,474 --> 02:23:40,216
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do go to San Francisco a lot, and I have a lot of friends over there, and it's a little more prevalent over there.

1830
02:23:41,036 --> 02:23:44,237
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's weird how many earthquakes there have

1831
02:23:44,457 --> 02:23:45,999
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1832
02:24:05,117 --> 02:24:12,359
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, actually, we've been having, you know, the earthquake itself here, where it hit here in Santiago, was about 7 point something.

1833
02:24:13,819 --> 02:24:16,140
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't quite 8, and at the epicenter it was 8.8.

1834
02:24:16,320 --> 02:24:18,660
[SPEAKER_13]: We got 2012, 2012, 2012.

1835
02:24:19,460 --> 02:24:26,842
[SPEAKER_13]: If you look at the footage that you will see on TV, it's most likely from that place, which is about 300 kilometers away from here.

1836
02:24:28,063 --> 02:24:51,500
[SPEAKER_13]: but still you know in earthquake distances that's nothing like it still hits pretty hard all around so you know it wasn't as bad as that but still what's funny or not that funny actually and that actually has me scared shitless lately is that every few hours there's going to be an aftershock and those aftershocks can reach 6.1 6.5 and all of a sudden you're just doing your things and everything's just shaking again and you know

1837
02:24:52,100 --> 02:24:54,223
[SPEAKER_13]: After we're waking up at 3.34 a.m.

1838
02:24:54,644 --> 02:25:00,791
[SPEAKER_13]: to an earthquake that fell the wall on your car, you get really nervous all the time.

1839
02:25:00,811 --> 02:25:05,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Especially for me, this is my first major thing because I live in Argentina and nothing happens.

1840
02:25:05,677 --> 02:25:06,759
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no earthquakes, no tornadoes.

1841
02:25:06,859 --> 02:25:09,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I heard they felt this one in Buenos Aires, so...

1842
02:25:10,183 --> 02:25:18,412
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but I've been in Buenos Aires when we quote-unquote feel an earthquake and it's like, oh, look, there's a wind gust.

1843
02:25:18,652 --> 02:25:19,633
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's like, it's nothing.

1844
02:25:19,813 --> 02:25:24,198
[SPEAKER_13]: But being here, I was honestly just, I don't remember being afraid.

1845
02:25:24,218 --> 02:25:25,379
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't remember anything.

1846
02:25:25,399 --> 02:25:30,625
[SPEAKER_13]: I just remember running away outside, away from trees and walls, just, you know.

1847
02:25:31,537 --> 02:25:42,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Footy Monster, just do your best to be safe, and don't live in fear too bad, because if it's your time, then lightning could strike you when you're walking down the street.

1848
02:25:43,606 --> 02:25:44,546
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

1849
02:25:44,747 --> 02:25:52,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything could happen ever, so don't live in fear, but always have a plan, and I think this is a good lesson for all the listeners.

1850
02:25:52,632 --> 02:25:55,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though we're a video gaming podcast, this is still a good opportunity to talk about if...

1851
02:25:57,155 --> 02:26:03,822
[SPEAKER_06]: I have one piece of advice in regards to that because it's been baffling my mind what people have been doing here.

1852
02:26:03,842 --> 02:26:06,865
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's an earthquake going on, if there's some sort of natural disaster going around you...

1853
02:26:18,417 --> 02:26:19,718
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't grab your laptop.

1854
02:26:20,038 --> 02:26:21,378
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't grab your DS.

1855
02:26:21,898 --> 02:26:23,099
[SPEAKER_13]: Just get out.

1856
02:26:24,079 --> 02:26:24,699
[SPEAKER_13]: Be safe.

1857
02:26:24,739 --> 02:26:31,041
[SPEAKER_13]: Put some shoes on because that's probably going to be dangerous if you're just walking in a place and try to get shoes at least.

1858
02:26:31,461 --> 02:26:33,282
[SPEAKER_13]: But other than that, just get out.

1859
02:26:33,462 --> 02:26:34,422
[SPEAKER_13]: Everything else is replaceable.

1860
02:26:36,910 --> 02:26:43,631
[SPEAKER_13]: ransacking like supermarkets and department stores and they're taking LCDs with them when they don't even have a house anymore and then to feed themselves.

1861
02:26:43,811 --> 02:26:45,352
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't even get it.

1862
02:26:45,432 --> 02:26:46,652
[SPEAKER_13]: Like some people are stupid.

1863
02:26:46,672 --> 02:26:47,992
[SPEAKER_13]: They react stupidly to this thing.

1864
02:26:48,012 --> 02:26:49,472
[SPEAKER_13]: So that would be my advice.

1865
02:26:49,552 --> 02:26:50,012
[SPEAKER_13]: Be smart.

1866
02:26:50,272 --> 02:26:51,733
[SPEAKER_13]: Just be safe first.

1867
02:26:51,873 --> 02:26:53,113
[SPEAKER_13]: Then worry about everything material.

1868
02:26:53,433 --> 02:26:58,054
[SPEAKER_06]: That is some unfortunate but necessary advice especially for a tech savvy crowd.

1869
02:26:58,534 --> 02:27:01,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Footy, I'm going to have to let you go to get some more calls but stay safe, okay?

1870
02:27:01,854 --> 02:27:02,095
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1871
02:27:02,115 --> 02:27:02,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much, guys.

1872
02:27:02,595 --> 02:27:03,175
[SPEAKER_06]: We're all thinking of you.

1873
02:27:03,275 --> 02:27:03,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care.

1874
02:27:04,295 --> 02:27:04,575
[SPEAKER_13]: You too.

1875
02:27:04,595 --> 02:27:04,695
[SPEAKER_13]: Bye.

1876
02:27:06,329 --> 02:27:29,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that's the last of it I hope there's not another big earthquake coming Oh boy Oh boy, alright Well we still have time for some more calls 1-877-GAME-OLR Use name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio Feel free to call in, tell some dick and fart jokes To kind of relieve the tension a little bit, it'd be nice Or talk about the unicorn game with Loki Because he will not stop playing it over there I just found something else disturbing Sure, what's that?

1877
02:27:30,807 --> 02:27:34,650
[SPEAKER_09]: The Wonder Twins are on Smallville now Goody goody, what's that mean?

1878
02:27:35,804 --> 02:27:43,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonder Twin Powers, Activate Oh god, wow Amazing, alright, let's go to the phones Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1879
02:27:44,229 --> 02:27:45,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, it's Ranma, what's up everyone?

1880
02:27:45,850 --> 02:27:46,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey Ranma, how you doing?

1881
02:27:47,091 --> 02:27:47,792
[SPEAKER_06]: We're good, how are you?

1882
02:27:47,812 --> 02:27:50,093
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm doing good What's on your mind tonight?

1883
02:27:51,054 --> 02:28:04,442
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, a couple of things Well, I want to reference back to the beginning of the episode About how they try to pass that little ban on swearing for a week Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-huh

1884
02:28:05,225 --> 02:28:12,437
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, a few months ago, they tried to do the same thing here in New York, but they tried to ban the N-word.

1885
02:28:13,800 --> 02:28:15,122
[SPEAKER_12]: It didn't get that far.

1886
02:28:16,423 --> 02:28:21,027
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, free speech is free speech, so I wouldn't support that.

1887
02:28:21,227 --> 02:28:27,073
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's a huge difference between the N-word and the F-word.

1888
02:28:27,153 --> 02:28:27,713
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

1889
02:28:28,234 --> 02:28:28,674
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I do.

1890
02:28:30,536 --> 02:28:31,437
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a huge difference.

1891
02:28:31,697 --> 02:28:35,340
[SPEAKER_06]: I still think people just shouldn't say the N-word out of good taste.

1892
02:28:35,400 --> 02:28:38,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if we were going to say, you know what, we're going to have...

1893
02:28:38,983 --> 02:28:44,808
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have our week where we're just going to start swearing profusely in protest of this law.

1894
02:28:45,068 --> 02:28:47,209
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to say every dirty word we can think of.

1895
02:28:47,269 --> 02:28:49,011
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to say fuck, shit, piss, so forth.

1896
02:28:49,351 --> 02:28:52,113
[SPEAKER_06]: I still wouldn't say that word, you know?

1897
02:28:53,134 --> 02:28:53,494
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course.

1898
02:28:53,594 --> 02:29:00,780
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean there are times I find myself saying it by accident or depending on the company that I am with, you know?

1899
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:01,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

1900
02:29:02,915 --> 02:29:10,517
[SPEAKER_12]: But a lot of times I do find it a little bit offensive, but half the time I just don't care because it kind of falls into free speech and it just doesn't bother me at all.

1901
02:29:10,897 --> 02:29:11,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1902
02:29:11,317 --> 02:29:14,478
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like – and I read a comment from the chatroom.

1903
02:29:14,558 --> 02:29:17,918
[SPEAKER_06]: GS68 says, wait, isn't not being able to say the N-word censorship?

1904
02:29:18,979 --> 02:29:20,019
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess, yeah, it is.

1905
02:29:20,499 --> 02:29:29,161
[SPEAKER_06]: But my whole thought is that I just don't want to say that because there's a big heavy weight that comes with saying that word and a lot of responsibility like –

1906
02:29:30,261 --> 02:29:32,984
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of those don't write checks your ass can't cash kind of thing.

1907
02:29:33,184 --> 02:29:34,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that make sense?

1908
02:29:35,166 --> 02:29:46,616
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're going to say a word like that, you better be prepared for the social repercussions that come with a very emotion-inducing word.

1909
02:29:46,956 --> 02:29:55,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Chris Rocks, though, said that if it's Christmas Eve and someone beats you in the head when you're trying to buy the last Barbie doll, that you can call them that for 45 minutes.

1910
02:29:58,479 --> 02:30:17,771
[SPEAKER_06]: 4 o'clock in the morning within a two block radius and you have to show your receipt I actually listened to that very recently that was funny excellent from Kitsune in chat saying the n-word is disrespectful saying fuck is not unless you call someone a fucker

1911
02:30:18,572 --> 02:30:19,593
[SPEAKER_09]: I call people fuckers.

1912
02:30:19,633 --> 02:30:20,694
[SPEAKER_09]: I call my husband fucker.

1913
02:30:20,774 --> 02:30:21,034
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1914
02:30:21,095 --> 02:30:23,157
[SPEAKER_06]: I call people fuckers and motherfuckers all the time.

1915
02:30:23,237 --> 02:30:25,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes it's a term of endearment, like bitch.

1916
02:30:25,700 --> 02:30:27,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, God, Jamie, you're such a bitch.

1917
02:30:27,582 --> 02:30:34,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, back when I was hanging... But I mean that in a positive, you know... Back when I was hanging out with a certain somebody... Mm-hmm.

1918
02:30:36,112 --> 02:30:46,022
[SPEAKER_09]: We actually had a whole conversation about that, about how the only people who could use those particular terms are the ones that it applied to, contextually.

1919
02:30:46,582 --> 02:30:49,325
[SPEAKER_09]: They even had a mention of that in the Hebrew Hammer, I thought was absolutely hilarious.

1920
02:30:51,187 --> 02:30:54,610
[SPEAKER_09]: So we used to go around calling each other, I guess, the H-word.

1921
02:30:57,210 --> 02:30:57,751
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to say it.

1922
02:30:57,831 --> 02:30:57,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Honky.

1923
02:30:57,991 --> 02:30:58,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

1924
02:30:58,511 --> 02:31:00,773
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, what pray tell is the H word?

1925
02:31:00,853 --> 02:31:01,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1926
02:31:01,254 --> 02:31:02,255
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, cracker and everything.

1927
02:31:02,275 --> 02:31:02,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

1928
02:31:02,935 --> 02:31:05,377
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, because it was like, okay, well, so they can do it.

1929
02:31:05,397 --> 02:31:05,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Why can't we?

1930
02:31:08,334 --> 02:31:10,656
[SPEAKER_09]: We had that conversation, so we just started going around doing it.

1931
02:31:11,477 --> 02:31:13,299
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, as a point of order.

1932
02:31:14,220 --> 02:31:23,470
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's not supposed to be insulting when you're the one doing it, when it's sort of like you taking it and turning it around.

1933
02:31:24,111 --> 02:31:28,796
[SPEAKER_09]: At the same time, you know, if someone else came and said that, it'd be like, oh, insult, blah, blah, blah.

1934
02:31:29,096 --> 02:31:29,797
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, but, you know...

1935
02:31:32,100 --> 02:31:33,321
[SPEAKER_09]: I could go on a whole rant about this.

1936
02:31:34,082 --> 02:31:34,622
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it.

1937
02:31:54,415 --> 02:32:04,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like some people like to or love to hide behind that anonymity on Xbox Live and just write checks left and right that are going to bounce, if you know what I mean.

1938
02:32:06,660 --> 02:32:06,960
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.

1939
02:32:07,340 --> 02:32:15,503
[SPEAKER_06]: So, anyhow, Ranma, after such a deep conversation, do you have a dick and fart joke or at least a video game you've been playing lately?

1940
02:32:16,664 --> 02:32:19,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Video game, but before I get into it, I just want to know, did you hear me on my keyboard?

1941
02:32:21,158 --> 02:32:21,378
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

1942
02:32:21,998 --> 02:32:22,438
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, good.

1943
02:32:22,819 --> 02:32:23,059
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1944
02:32:24,459 --> 02:32:24,919
[SPEAKER_12]: No, you're fine.

1945
02:32:26,660 --> 02:32:29,080
[SPEAKER_12]: I downloaded Blaster Master Overdrive.

1946
02:32:29,821 --> 02:32:30,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, yes, yes.

1947
02:32:30,941 --> 02:32:32,241
[SPEAKER_06]: I talked about this a couple weeks ago.

1948
02:32:32,281 --> 02:32:32,842
[SPEAKER_12]: What did you think?

1949
02:32:33,562 --> 02:32:34,482
[SPEAKER_12]: I really liked it.

1950
02:32:35,242 --> 02:32:37,163
[SPEAKER_12]: My roommate, he's played it.

1951
02:32:37,763 --> 02:32:43,765
[SPEAKER_12]: His main gripe is the fact that in the original NES version, you could jump higher with Sophia.

1952
02:32:45,990 --> 02:32:48,552
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even catch that difference, but that's a good one.

1953
02:32:49,132 --> 02:32:49,853
[SPEAKER_06]: He caught that.

1954
02:32:50,053 --> 02:32:51,794
[SPEAKER_06]: The controls were what pissed me off.

1955
02:32:51,874 --> 02:32:53,515
[SPEAKER_06]: That whole strafing with the button.

1956
02:32:55,196 --> 02:32:55,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Yuck.

1957
02:32:57,758 --> 02:32:58,659
[SPEAKER_06]: But otherwise you liked it.

1958
02:32:58,679 --> 02:33:00,140
[SPEAKER_12]: Classic controller right there, you know?

1959
02:33:00,440 --> 02:33:02,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they needed the classic controller.

1960
02:33:02,441 --> 02:33:06,524
[SPEAKER_06]: There were these few little imperfections with the game that needed to be fixed.

1961
02:33:06,544 --> 02:33:07,025
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

1962
02:33:09,046 --> 02:33:12,128
[SPEAKER_12]: The fact of the matter is we have a sequel.

1963
02:33:12,168 --> 02:33:14,570
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we're kind of more excited about that than anything else.

1964
02:33:15,208 --> 02:33:15,648
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

1965
02:33:15,909 --> 02:33:16,709
[SPEAKER_06]: At least it happened.

1966
02:33:17,010 --> 02:33:17,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Better than nothing.

1967
02:33:18,151 --> 02:33:21,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Ranma, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you so much, okay?

1968
02:33:21,053 --> 02:33:21,914
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem.

1969
02:33:21,934 --> 02:33:23,956
[SPEAKER_06]: And have fun with Blaster Master and the remixed music.

1970
02:33:24,016 --> 02:33:24,476
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty good.

1971
02:33:24,617 --> 02:33:25,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, later.

1972
02:33:27,279 --> 02:33:28,820
[SPEAKER_06]: We can probably squeeze in one more call.

1973
02:33:29,141 --> 02:33:33,625
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to go to Loki, though, if he's taking a break from the Unicorn game and see if there's any last-minute stories.

1974
02:33:33,665 --> 02:33:34,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie, too, if she has anything.

1975
02:33:35,430 --> 02:33:36,471
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm ranting in the chat room.

1976
02:33:36,951 --> 02:33:37,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

1977
02:33:37,612 --> 02:33:37,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

1978
02:33:38,212 --> 02:33:38,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1979
02:33:39,053 --> 02:33:42,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently the ESRB has revealed yet another lips game on the way.

1980
02:33:42,275 --> 02:33:49,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently it's called I Heart the 80s and it will feature such songs including... Let's see here.

1981
02:33:50,741 --> 02:33:55,844
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really say, but they say some of the songs, of course, or lyrics that are in there.

1982
02:33:55,924 --> 02:33:56,965
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a very kinky girl.

1983
02:33:57,645 --> 02:34:03,569
[SPEAKER_02]: I really need to love... I really love to taste her and you don't have to sell your body to the night.

1984
02:34:04,250 --> 02:34:04,450
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1985
02:34:04,864 --> 02:34:06,365
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even recognize those songs.

1986
02:34:06,385 --> 02:34:08,807
[SPEAKER_02]: I recognize, uh, she's a very kink girl.

1987
02:34:09,007 --> 02:34:10,047
[SPEAKER_02]: I do recognize that one.

1988
02:34:10,928 --> 02:34:11,829
[SPEAKER_06]: That one I recognize.

1989
02:34:12,629 --> 02:34:13,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's take a quick call.

1990
02:34:13,770 --> 02:34:14,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1991
02:34:14,750 --> 02:34:15,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1992
02:34:16,151 --> 02:34:16,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening!

1993
02:34:17,032 --> 02:34:21,915
[SPEAKER_00]: You, uh, crossed the, uh, supposed, like, oh, what the fuck, I lost it.

1994
02:34:22,335 --> 02:34:24,637
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, hello there, oh my lord, this is Akira Bird.

1995
02:34:25,037 --> 02:34:26,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, it's the other Swedish guy.

1996
02:34:26,978 --> 02:34:27,639
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing?

1997
02:34:28,519 --> 02:34:29,340
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing just fine.

1998
02:34:29,480 --> 02:34:33,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, what do you think about this whole fact that now we have, like, a second Swedish listener?

1999
02:34:33,282 --> 02:34:34,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you okay with that?

2000
02:34:34,952 --> 02:34:37,155
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

2001
02:34:37,175 --> 02:34:37,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you hear that?

2002
02:34:37,776 --> 02:34:38,758
[SPEAKER_06]: I missed that.

2003
02:34:38,798 --> 02:34:40,480
[SPEAKER_06]: He called in a couple weeks ago, too.

2004
02:34:40,801 --> 02:34:42,504
[SPEAKER_06]: We have another guy in Sweden who listens.

2005
02:34:43,377 --> 02:35:10,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh damn Of course I know Sweden's a big place I'd be all like do you guys know each other But you know that would be like a little silly Because that's like when people ask me if I see celebrities Because I live in California When LA is like 8 hours away from here And even when you're in LA you don't really see celebrities Because celebrities don't really like to You know they don't really go out in public And shop at you know Vons often you know It's different But anyway what's on your mind I'm sorry I didn't mean to get on the tangent there

2006
02:35:11,910 --> 02:35:29,507
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I have a question for Jamie, actually, since, well, how would, if someone, if a Sims 3 player that plays Sims 3 quite a bit would actually attempt to try to play Sims 2, how would that feel?

2007
02:35:31,129 --> 02:35:31,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, wait, wait, say that.

2008
02:35:31,929 --> 02:35:33,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Taking a step backwards, I think.

2009
02:35:33,310 --> 02:35:36,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, if you're a Sims 3 fan.

2010
02:35:36,051 --> 02:35:37,532
[SPEAKER_10]: I've gone back and played Sims 2.

2011
02:35:38,693 --> 02:35:45,876
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was fun picking up my old games because there's actually, because the mod community, you know, there's so much more out for Sims 2.

2012
02:35:46,276 --> 02:35:47,737
[SPEAKER_09]: I could do a whole lot more in my games.

2013
02:35:47,777 --> 02:35:49,958
[SPEAKER_09]: I really enjoy going back to Sims 2 every so often.

2014
02:35:50,578 --> 02:35:54,680
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm, wait, Sims 3 is catching up.

2015
02:35:55,521 --> 02:35:55,721
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

2016
02:35:57,099 --> 02:36:12,393
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, yeah, because I have been... Because the most fun I'm having is that since I have the World of Adventures expansion, I have this...

2017
02:36:14,075 --> 02:36:24,262
[SPEAKER_00]: I like having my sims doing the spar part against each other because the kung fu part is way entertaining, actually.

2018
02:36:24,382 --> 02:36:32,908
[SPEAKER_06]: I just have to share, I'm looking over at DarkSakura's desk and World Adventures is sitting right on the desk under one of her knitting projects right there.

2019
02:36:32,928 --> 02:36:34,990
[SPEAKER_06]: And then High End Loft Stuff is right there, too.

2020
02:36:35,050 --> 02:36:36,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, I just got them together.

2021
02:36:36,351 --> 02:36:36,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

2022
02:36:36,931 --> 02:36:38,492
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to reinstall everything.

2023
02:36:38,532 --> 02:36:41,334
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just funny you brought it up because they're sitting on her desk right now.

2024
02:36:41,354 --> 02:36:42,015
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll take a picture.

2025
02:36:44,117 --> 02:36:51,040
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of high-end lost stuff, do you think it's worth it?

2026
02:36:51,220 --> 02:36:57,322
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem myself is that, well, because I was found like cheap...

2027
02:36:58,689 --> 02:37:09,917
[SPEAKER_00]: I found cheap Sims 2 games was that I found the original Sims 2 and a few expansions.

2028
02:37:10,338 --> 02:37:16,122
[SPEAKER_00]: The expansions for the second part is the animal thing, whatever.

2029
02:37:16,362 --> 02:37:17,123
[SPEAKER_01]: The pets and everything?

2030
02:37:18,175 --> 02:37:18,435
[SPEAKER_00]: Pets.

2031
02:37:19,516 --> 02:37:26,278
[SPEAKER_00]: And the travel parts.

2032
02:37:28,899 --> 02:37:29,180
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.

2033
02:37:30,720 --> 02:37:36,723
[SPEAKER_00]: And the supposed annoying thing is that, well, the expansion in Sims 2 that I'm...

2034
02:37:37,703 --> 02:37:49,754
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have yet, since the expansions that I'm interested in are the year-round... The seasons.

2035
02:37:50,234 --> 02:37:51,615
[SPEAKER_00]: Seasons.

2036
02:37:51,776 --> 02:37:52,937
[SPEAKER_00]: Seasons and free time.

2037
02:37:53,237 --> 02:38:04,267
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, well, at the current, my Sims 3 game I find is a bit boring, but in a way kind of funny, since...

2038
02:38:05,140 --> 02:38:10,782
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I like to have my Sims sleeping outside.

2039
02:38:13,543 --> 02:38:16,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I know that for World of Ventures you've got the tents and everything.

2040
02:38:16,265 --> 02:38:23,347
[SPEAKER_09]: To be honest, my whole thing with Sims 2 was really just building houses, which is the same thing I do in Sims 3.

2041
02:38:25,308 --> 02:38:26,389
[SPEAKER_09]: I love building houses.

2042
02:38:27,069 --> 02:38:29,470
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's really all I do in it, is just build houses.

2043
02:38:30,817 --> 02:38:32,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

2044
02:38:47,908 --> 02:38:52,094
[SPEAKER_09]: or The Sims Resource, you can get all kinds of stuff.

2045
02:38:52,274 --> 02:39:02,246
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you sort right for which expansions that you have, you can get all kinds of just really cool stuff that's all made by user-made content.

2046
02:39:02,987 --> 02:39:03,868
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but here's the other thing.

2047
02:39:04,608 --> 02:39:26,945
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if you can tell me, but the only thing I want to know in any kind of way is that, well, are the stuff that's included in high-end Loft stuff, are there actually a point better than things that you get in the expansion or the original game?

2048
02:39:27,125 --> 02:39:29,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I haven't actually got it to run yet.

2049
02:39:31,588 --> 02:39:56,424
[SPEAKER_09]: Mine froze because of all the mods I have already installed because I have the no blur mod so you can actually see them naked I hate the blur, it just annoys me and I have a couple of slider hacks so that I can change different parts of the body and I think I might have to reinstall everything to get my games to play

2050
02:39:57,806 --> 02:40:04,931
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can't say anything on that because I'm using no mods at all, unfortunately.

2051
02:40:08,093 --> 02:40:11,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe she'll have a better answer for that component in a couple weeks when she gets all that fixed.

2052
02:40:11,955 --> 02:40:26,905
[SPEAKER_06]: But kind of going back to the original question, I think the best point that was made by Jamie there was the whole point about that if there's something you want to go back and kind of experience that was in 2, especially with all the mods that were done for it and probably a bunch of scenarios that exist out there on the internet and so forth...

2053
02:40:27,325 --> 02:40:28,486
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really the best way to do it.

2054
02:40:28,566 --> 02:40:30,308
[SPEAKER_06]: And the fact it's dirt cheap now.

2055
02:40:30,588 --> 02:40:36,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you can get... The whole Sims Uber collection's gotta be really affordable at this point, right?

2056
02:40:36,352 --> 02:40:36,913
[SPEAKER_09]: I think so.

2057
02:40:37,053 --> 02:40:40,035
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you probably get like... I think they do like whole box sets now.

2058
02:40:40,296 --> 02:40:42,237
[SPEAKER_06]: But Aki Ripper, I say take it to the extreme.

2059
02:40:42,497 --> 02:40:43,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Go all the way back and play Sims 1.

2060
02:40:44,059 --> 02:40:44,879
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no.

2061
02:40:47,521 --> 02:40:50,824
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's possible with my computer since I'm running...

2062
02:40:52,385 --> 02:40:57,170
[SPEAKER_00]: Running 64-bit Windows 7 at the moment.

2063
02:40:57,190 --> 02:40:58,050
[SPEAKER_00]: How about SimCity?

2064
02:40:58,070 --> 02:40:59,472
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's possible.

2065
02:40:59,972 --> 02:41:00,172
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2066
02:41:00,392 --> 02:41:02,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Aki Ripper, we've got to let you go so we can wrap up the show.

2067
02:41:02,454 --> 02:41:03,876
[SPEAKER_06]: But thanks so much for the call, okay, buddy?

2068
02:41:04,997 --> 02:41:05,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Later.

2069
02:41:05,457 --> 02:41:06,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Have fun simming.

2070
02:41:07,699 --> 02:41:07,939
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2071
02:41:07,959 --> 02:41:09,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks so much, guys, for the call tonight.

2072
02:41:09,360 --> 02:41:10,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Apologies to those that didn't get through.

2073
02:41:11,582 --> 02:41:13,044
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a lot of stuff going on tonight, though.

2074
02:41:13,104 --> 02:41:16,607
[SPEAKER_06]: So, again, you can always send us an email and tweets and all that good stuff.

2075
02:41:16,909 --> 02:41:17,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Please do.

2076
02:41:17,810 --> 02:41:19,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Many ways to interact with Orange Lounge Radio.

2077
02:41:19,451 --> 02:41:20,571
[SPEAKER_06]: We always appreciate it.

2078
02:41:20,951 --> 02:41:24,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's go around and wrap up any other last minute stories.

2079
02:41:24,754 --> 02:41:26,275
[SPEAKER_06]: I cut Loki off for that call.

2080
02:41:26,695 --> 02:41:27,075
[SPEAKER_02]: That's alright.

2081
02:41:27,875 --> 02:41:30,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Pump It Up Fiesta has been unveiled to be coming out March 2010.

2082
02:41:31,478 --> 02:41:35,740
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the brand new upgrade for Pump It Up.

2083
02:41:36,601 --> 02:41:40,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't this what happened to some of the folks behind In The Groove are now with the Pump It Up folks?

2084
02:41:41,243 --> 02:41:41,644
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2085
02:41:41,664 --> 02:41:43,665
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I thought happened.

2086
02:41:44,386 --> 02:41:54,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, though, Fiesta will strengthen the intermediate steps for pump lovers, mania, and newly improved easy steps for beginners.

2087
02:41:54,968 --> 02:41:58,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Players also have the option of versus mode in Fiesta.

2088
02:42:00,289 --> 02:42:01,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

2089
02:42:01,309 --> 02:42:05,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Separated interfaces to better accommodate general players and pump lovers from the start.

2090
02:42:06,450 --> 02:42:12,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Users can play one of the custom-made steps by using USB, so custom stuff's kind of cool.

2091
02:42:12,971 --> 02:42:20,573
[SPEAKER_02]: and Fiesta is compatible with both personal USB and pump USB, whatever that... I imagine they're all about the same anyways.

2092
02:42:20,613 --> 02:42:22,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, go have a Fiesta with Pump It Up Fiesta.

2093
02:42:22,613 --> 02:42:24,674
[SPEAKER_02]: And they do have a partial song list.

2094
02:42:24,974 --> 02:42:25,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a siesta.

2095
02:42:26,214 --> 02:42:29,655
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to see if there's anything other than Banya stuff on here.

2096
02:42:31,435 --> 02:42:32,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, good old Banya.

2097
02:42:32,815 --> 02:42:33,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Tons of Banya.

2098
02:42:34,396 --> 02:42:35,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Banya production stuff.

2099
02:42:37,406 --> 02:42:41,714
[SPEAKER_02]: They did a remake of Turkey March, I guess.

2100
02:42:41,754 --> 02:42:43,197
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been in pump forever.

2101
02:42:44,179 --> 02:42:48,247
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of remakes and remixes in there.

2102
02:42:48,267 --> 02:42:48,768
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of cool.

2103
02:42:50,690 --> 02:42:53,833
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2104
02:43:11,948 --> 02:43:18,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though the game just came out last week, New Line Cinema has optioned the rights for the film adaptation of Heavy Rain.

2105
02:43:19,590 --> 02:43:22,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though the game plays out pretty much like a film anyways, I guess I could see that.

2106
02:43:26,632 --> 02:43:31,754
[SPEAKER_02]: And then... That's pretty much all I wanted to talk about.

2107
02:43:33,251 --> 02:43:33,591
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2108
02:43:34,232 --> 02:43:39,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's going to bring us to the close of a show, but not until we go around and get everybody's final thought.

2109
02:43:39,215 --> 02:43:45,719
[SPEAKER_06]: But first, let me say a big thank you to everybody, of course, for tuning in and supporting Orange Lounge Radio and supporting independent podcasting.

2110
02:43:46,560 --> 02:43:48,121
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't really make any money off this show.

2111
02:43:48,161 --> 02:43:49,122
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, we pay to do it.

2112
02:43:49,662 --> 02:43:52,724
[SPEAKER_06]: So we do really appreciate all you guys who help us spread the word.

2113
02:43:52,764 --> 02:43:56,527
[SPEAKER_06]: All we ask, just tell one or two people about the show and help us spread the word.

2114
02:43:56,547 --> 02:44:02,391
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, we always do love, love when people post kind reviews of us out on the internet, whether it be on

2115
02:44:03,571 --> 02:44:07,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys so much for all the kind words about us on the internet.

2116
02:44:07,734 --> 02:44:09,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2117
02:44:09,274 --> 02:44:09,935
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll start with Loki tonight.

2118
02:44:09,955 --> 02:44:10,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, what's your final thought?

2119
02:44:21,656 --> 02:44:30,201
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait to go home and install Hyper Spin 1.0 into my cabinet and finally drop down that list of games so I can actually play some stuff.

2120
02:44:31,542 --> 02:44:34,144
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is Itchy.

2121
02:44:35,284 --> 02:44:35,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Tasty?

2122
02:44:36,005 --> 02:44:37,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, DarkSakura.

2123
02:44:37,546 --> 02:44:38,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Tasty.

2124
02:44:39,207 --> 02:44:40,207
[SPEAKER_06]: That's your final thought, Tasty?

2125
02:44:40,447 --> 02:44:41,488
[SPEAKER_11]: You said Itchy, I said Tasty.

2126
02:44:41,568 --> 02:44:42,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, there you go.

2127
02:44:42,309 --> 02:44:42,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Itchy and Scratchy.

2128
02:44:43,329 --> 02:44:44,010
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Rob.

2129
02:44:44,570 --> 02:44:45,931
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I know.

2130
02:44:46,611 --> 02:44:47,512
[SPEAKER_06]: And Jill, yeah, I get it.

2131
02:44:48,732 --> 02:44:50,293
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want to end up a Jill sandwich.

2132
02:44:50,313 --> 02:44:50,994
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

2133
02:44:52,668 --> 02:44:53,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, thank you guys so much.

2134
02:44:54,511 --> 02:44:56,293
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be back here next week to do it all again.

2135
02:44:56,514 --> 02:45:00,479
[SPEAKER_06]: So until then, that's going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2136
02:45:00,840 --> 02:45:01,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a great week everybody.

2137
02:45:02,001 --> 02:45:05,466
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you next week with another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
