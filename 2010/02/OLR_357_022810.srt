00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,800
Tonight, February 28th, 2010.

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,360
Which country has banned heavy rain?

3
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,960
A date is announced for the Final Fantasy XIV beta, and a Nintendo Press event brings

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,760
us a barrage of Wii and DS news.

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,640
Hello, my friends, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, that talk show

6
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,080
on the internet, live every Sunday night, dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming

7
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,240
culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

8
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,480
It is the show where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,720
We do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern time

10
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,480
at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf Show.

11
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,160
A big thanks to them for letting us steal their bandwidth every single week.

12
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,240
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you over the next few hours, I'll say hello to the one

13
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,240
and only DarkSakura.

14
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,240
Meh.

15
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,240
How are you?

16
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,240
Meh.

17
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,240
Meh.

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,240
Meh.

19
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,880
I have one thing to say to the California government.

20
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,880
Meh.

21
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,880
Fuck.

22
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,800
I'll get into that in a little bit during housekeeping, absolutely.

23
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,760
If you wonder what she's talking about, and it's not just an unbalanced budget, but there's

24
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,640
other stuff going on, you've probably heard.

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,160
I think it's made those water cooler press stories this week.

26
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,600
And boy do we have the response for you, we're gonna get into that in a little bit.

27
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,560
Uh, we do talk games too, right, Techmaster Loki?

28
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,560
Also here joining us every week?

29
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,560
Um, yeah, every now and then.

30
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,560
How you doing, Loki?

31
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,560
I'm doing okay.

32
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,040
I like that, every now and then we do decide to get around to games.

33
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,280
So today was the end of the Olympics, right?

34
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,800
Um, apparently it is.

35
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,800
Are they done?

36
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
The closing ceremony?

37
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
I guess they're done.

38
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,360
Okay, good, we won't have to compete against them anymore, cause our listener numbers have

39
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,520
been down, cause people gotta watch their curling.

40
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,480
Yay, the office is gonna be back on, that makes me happy.

41
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,840
Alright, all the shows, are you excited about the Tonight Show with Jay Leno?

42
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,800
Oh, I'm not watching that.

43
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,800
Yeah, nobody is.

44
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,800
Alright, uh.

45
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,640
Yeah, I'm boycotting him.

46
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,040
Nobody with any taste is.

47
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,800
My grandma's happy, I'll tell you that.

48
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,800
Alright, let's get into our gaming weeks.

49
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,240
Yes, once in a while we do talk about video games here, and we let the gamers have a voice

50
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,840
in our chat room, chat.orangelauntrady.com, but don't worry, if you're not listening live,

51
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,420
if you're listening on the podcast feed, there are a million billion ways to communicate

52
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,420
with the show.

53
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,000
If there's a social network for it, we're probably on it somewhere.

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Uh, the Twitters, the Facebooks, we take emails every week.

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
All of it.

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,980
And phone calls a little later on too, so uh, yeah, we'll look forward to chatting with

57
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,980
you guys.

58
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,540
Uh, let's get into our gaming weeks though.

59
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,000
Let's actually bring it to games, video games.

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,120
What have you been playing this week, Dark Sakura?

61
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,120
Um, not really much of anything, I really haven't had any time.

62
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,860
I've been, had a very, very busy week.

63
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,560
I've played a little, actually no I didn't, I actually played any Star Trek Online this

64
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,560
week, I don't think.

65
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,560
So.

66
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,560
Wow, are you okay?

67
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,560
Are you feeling okay?

68
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,560
Real life.

69
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,720
Well, that happens.

70
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,040
I've had lots of homework to do and lots of, you know, responsibilities to take care of,

71
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,040
so I haven't really played anything.

72
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,760
Well, you gotta take a break once in a while.

73
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,080
Although I've tried to play my Sims 3 and it probably hates my mod, so I have to reinstall

74
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,080
it, so whatever.

75
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,160
Well, Loki, how about you, have you been playing anything this week?

76
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:19,680
Um, just a lot of Borderlands, um, I've been trying to go through and finish Mad Moxie's

77
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,320
Underdome and unfortunately didn't get a chance to do that because the ones I'm on now are

78
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:33,760
the 20 round matches, which, each round has 5 waves in it and it takes forever, so, unfortunately

79
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,040
I made it only through 7 rounds before I realized I'm not gonna be able to finish it in the

80
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,600
time that I had, so I quit that and played a little bit more just the standard campaign

81
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:48,580
now, but I'm almost maxed out as far as, um, you know, my level goes.

82
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:53,320
But I am kind of trying to collect some weapons and stuff because, you know, I downloaded

83
00:03:53,320 --> 00:04:00,480
the new expansion, um, and unfortunately the new expansion kills any mods that you have,

84
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,760
so can't use my modded weapons as cool as they are, so I just have to find something,

85
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,000
you know, newer ones to use, but, I mean you can still mod weapons, you just can't go crazy

86
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,440
with them now, you can't put like shotgun parts on a pistol or, you know, rocket launch

87
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,960
parts on a machine gun or whatever, you just have to keep it within the rules of the game,

88
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,360
so I don't know, it'll be fun.

89
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,040
Um, and then of course, more Grand Theft Auto and, uh, doing well on that, still trying

90
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:40,780
to move up the leaderboards and, uh, I broke 200 now for cumulative, uh, ranked death matches

91
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:53,280
and I'm, I think, almost like in the 60's for, uh, true skill rankings, so, it's going

92
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,440
pretty well, I'll be up there pretty soon.

93
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,720
The only problem is though, is those guys that are actually in the top of the true skill

94
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:07,000
ranks, they tend not to want to play games, um, that they're losing, apparently they drop

95
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,640
out and so it doesn't, their rank doesn't go down.

96
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,140
So I actually did run into some people, I actually ran into the number one player and

97
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:19,760
like the number six player and both of them did not want to play me, which is too bad

98
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,320
because I would have kicked the crap out of them.

99
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,760
That's it, that's why I'm playing this week.

100
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,960
And you still have a cold, you were sick last week and you're still sick.

101
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,960
Yeah.

102
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,960
Are you feeling okay?

103
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,960
Um.

104
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
Do you need some medication?

105
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:38,080
No, I'm fine, I took two days off this week and that's where I play a lot Borderlands,

106
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,840
and did other things, but uh, you can't really go into that because a wife would not be happy.

107
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:51,020
Alright then, fine, uh, okay, my gaming week, actually I had a week similar to Jamie's where

108
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,960
a lot of real life stuff is coming into play.

109
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,800
I'm still working on the whole moving thing, which will be done like tomorrow, so thankfully.

110
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,840
But I did play a little bit, I did get into World of Warcraft of course, my boyfriend

111
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,320
and I have been leveling together, I helped him kind of get started with the character,

112
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,600
actually no, I take that back, he started the character and by the time it got to about

113
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,040
level 21, I don't remember, 23, somewhere in there, we started leveling together and

114
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,680
now we just hit 50 this weekend, so yay to leveling.

115
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,000
It's kind of fun to have somebody to always play WoW with, it's cool.

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,400
You know, I'm really trying to get as much Borderlands in this week, because I have a

117
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,080
feeling I'm going to have Final Fantasy 13 by the end of this week, and oh my god, everything's

118
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,080
going to stop.

119
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,700
Wait, wait, wait, is your connections getting that early, because I want to place an order

120
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:36,080
if so.

121
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,400
I don't know if we have extras, but I will check, that's for sure.

122
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,120
You can count on me coming over on Saturday if that's the case, oh no, I'm going to be

123
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,120
out of town this weekend, oh well, Monday, Monday for sure.

124
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,800
Alright, well anyway, all that stuff aside, yeah, I'm very excited about Final Fantasy

125
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,280
13, I was very busy with movies, I didn't play a lot, but I did have one night earlier

126
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,360
this week, I just decided to have a retro 360 arcade night for the heck of it, because

127
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,520
I was joking on last week's show that, you know, we had this story where it came up at

128
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,800
some point during the show that the former Midway games had all disappeared from Xbox

129
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,920
Live, Joust and Smash TV, so I had a night where I just decided to play a bunch of retro

130
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,600
games, I went in, I played Joust, I went in, I played, I don't think I actually played

131
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,480
Smash TV, I started playing Jyris for a while, for some weird reason, like, well, it's not

132
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,040
a weird reason, I just really love that game, it's one of my favorite shooters from the

133
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,040
80s.

134
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,960
I actually beat my former high score, which isn't very good, I need to work on it.

135
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,920
You know, Jyris, and a lot of the old arcade games admittedly, is all about memorization,

136
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,580
like knowing where the ships come from in every wave, so I just really need to kind

137
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,480
of work on it for a little while, but I got a better score, so that made me happy.

138
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,440
I think I beat my score on another old game too, and I can't remember which one it was,

139
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,720
I don't remember if it was Time Pilot or, no, I think it was like Tempest, again though,

140
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,840
my score is still not very good, I need to work on it.

141
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:54,240
Yeah, as I mentioned, you know, one of the things I did while I was sick is worked on

142
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,780
something that my wife would not like, and that is I'm building up parts of Arcade Cabinet

143
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:04,640
for work, so that's actually coming along pretty well, it looks pretty nice.

144
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,620
But I'm excited because today, actually, they released the new version of Hyperspin, which

145
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:15,740
is the frontend I use for my cabinet, and the thing I like about the new one the best

146
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:23,000
is they have a way to add games to your favorites list, really simple, and that's going to make

147
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,500
cutting down the list of 5,000 games to what I'm actually going to play a whole lot faster

148
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,760
than I was doing it before, so I'm actually going to be downloading that probably when

149
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,880
I get home, and I'm going to go through my cabinet and get it all ready to go, but actually

150
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:46,880
I put a second brand new graphics card into it so that I could play BlazBlue Continuum

151
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:54,480
Shift at full speed, and I can now, and it's awesome, but for some reason, an IOMI version

152
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,000
of Marvel is Capcom 2 still has slowdowns in it, but it's not by my computer because

153
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,680
it's certainly fast enough, so.

154
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,040
Let me ask kind of like a random MAME question, because I'm going to be honest, I haven't

155
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:11,160
played MAME, the Arcade Emulator, in quite a long time.

156
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,400
Did it ever get to the point where, like, it does more things online, like the exchange

157
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,740
of high scores or like an online leaderboard or something?

158
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,960
Because I really see that as being some of the big appeal of Game Room to me, the legitimate

159
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,400
MAME or whatever you want to call it, I think it's really cool that I'm going to have leaderboards

160
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,360
with friends and, you know, some of that medals and achievements element.

161
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,800
MAME is just flat out emulating the old games, right?

162
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,200
They didn't add any frills to it?

163
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,040
They didn't really add any frills to it, you can get ones that'll do different things,

164
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,720
but it's mainly they're just looking for the actual arcade emulation that, you know, using

165
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:52,960
just your processor and, you know, no, you know, using your graphics card for anything.

166
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,760
As far as playing stuff online with each other, they don't really have that.

167
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,760
And I can understand, you know, the high scores and stuff, that'd be kind of tough.

168
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:08,040
I mean, they do have patches now that will save your high scores, but nothing that you

169
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,360
can play online with each other.

170
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:17,320
They may have, like, you know, there's other programs out there like MESS or Misfit MAME,

171
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,280
which will run all sorts of hacked games.

172
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:27,440
Maybe those will have, you know, some sort of online play or something, but MAME does not.

173
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,640
Honestly, it does make sense, though, that there's not a lot of frills, because MAME is

174
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,680
sort of in that really gray area of legality as it is.

175
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,520
I mean, there's nothing wrong with the MAME program itself, but it's the fact that, you

176
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:42,960
know, the ROMs are not legal, except for a handful, you know, there have been a few that

177
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:47,560
the original creators of the game have come back and said, yeah, that was like 25 years

178
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,120
ago and we're not going to make any money off of it, so we hereby release it in the

179
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,120
public domain.

180
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,120
Woohoo, have fun.

181
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,680
There have been a handful of those games.

182
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,280
So I think if MAME were to come in and say, oh, we're going to implement this online leaderboard

183
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:04,320
for this game, it would really kind of start to push the boundaries of the gray area of

184
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,320
legality that it's in.

185
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,880
It'd be tough to do it, and it'd be tough to make sure people aren't cheating in it,

186
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,880
and just...

187
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,880
True.

188
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,440
It'd just be too difficult.

189
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:22,160
But I do believe, actually, that I think Macaron or maybe Demul, one of the Dreamcast emulators,

190
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,680
is actually doing online.

191
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,040
You can play multiplayer over, like, the internet.

192
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,040
No, that's cool.

193
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,840
And I know those do Niomi games, so like Marvel vs. Capcom 2 or...

194
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,520
Did they ever perfect it on the NES or Super Nintendo, because I remember some of those

195
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:40,520
old, old emulators, like, I want to say, like, Nesticle, even, if you remember that one,

196
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:45,040
and Zessness had internet play, but it was kind of wonky.

197
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,120
Did they ever perfect that?

198
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,120
I think those have gotten better.

199
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,120
I don't know.

200
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,120
I don't play over the internet with that stuff.

201
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,120
The same with MAME.

202
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:57,800
I mean, it's my, my cabinet, unfortunately, the motherboard in it's really cheap, and

203
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,320
so anytime I overclock it, the ethernet stops working, so...

204
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:07,880
Well, I've always said I would love Nintendo's Virtual Console if it was on Xbox Live.

205
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,680
That's what I've always said about Virtual Console.

206
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,400
We're going to get into this more later, but I'm honestly surprised at the release schedule

207
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,200
that they have right now, so maybe they are coming around, I mean, because that's basically

208
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:25,800
all the games that they announced at E3 coming out before E3 this year, so it's like, okay,

209
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,480
clean slate, what are you going to announce for the rest of the year, you know?

210
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,320
Yeah, we'll get into that a little bit, though.

211
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,720
Before we get into the gaming news, let me do some housekeeping tonight.

212
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,160
We don't have a whole lot of housekeeping here in house, but something Dark Soccer referenced

213
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,960
a little earlier in the show, I just kind of wanted to share this and throw this out

214
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:45,000
there with you guys, apparently the California State Assembly passed a measure this week

215
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
that is going to support anti-swearing week, or what do they call it, no cussing week,

216
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
right?

217
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The first week of March.

218
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yeah, something like that.

219
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,480
So starting Monday, because today's the last day of February, believe it or not, so starting

220
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,340
Monday, it is no cuss week in California.

221
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:02,360
So if you so much as say fuck out loud, you're going to get hauled off to jail.

222
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,160
No, okay, it's not really like that.

223
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:13,400
What it is, I don't know, some kid in a club in California started this no cussing club,

224
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:18,000
and it caught on amongst all these people that think if you cuss, then clearly you're

225
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,440
not intelligent because only unintelligent people have to fill their vocabulary with

226
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,360
cuss words, blah, blah, blah, I don't know, something along those lines.

227
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,160
So somehow this got all the way to the State Assembly.

228
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,600
While we are in the midst of a budget crisis, yet again, mind you, and we can't even go

229
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,400
to the DMV anymore because we're not even sure when they're actually open, because they're

230
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,400
closed half the time.

231
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,880
Anyway, sorry, I don't want to get on the political tangent here too much.

232
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,200
So they found time to pass this resolution to support the no cussing week, and they're

233
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:51,780
encouraging that everybody should keep a swear jar, and if you say fuck or damn or whatever,

234
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,720
you should put in 25 cents into the swear jar.

235
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:03,320
So yeah, and you should donate this to charity, to Haiti or probably Chile now, and obviously

236
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,520
our thoughts to everybody who was affected by that recent thing, and I don't have a problem

237
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:14,500
with donating to charity, but I think I have a little bit of a problem with the government

238
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,760
endorsing something that sort of infringes on freedom of speech.

239
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,520
I mean, call me crazy, and if you look at this dude's website for the no cussing club,

240
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:29,120
they're selling books, they're selling charters on how to start your own club, gee, the guy's

241
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,080
profiting off this idea.

242
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,960
Are they taxing him?

243
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,960
I hope so.

244
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:39,520
Well, you know what, you can't knock him for profiting off of it because if people are

245
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,680
dumb enough to pay him for it, then whatever.

246
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:50,480
I mean, that's what capitalism is built on, profiting off the stupid, so why not?

247
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,840
I'm sorry, again, I don't mean to get on the political train, but this does affect video

248
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,840
games because this is the home of Silicon Valley and where a lot of the games are made,

249
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,080
so you know, if the state goes belly up, so are a lot of your favorite game publishers.

250
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,080
Well they're already written.

251
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,680
I'm sorry, but this non-cussing week is about as, okay, now I don't even want to compare

252
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:15,200
it to that because this, you know, god damn it if I make fun of Talk Like a Pirate Day,

253
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:20,840
but I mean, as far as non-cussing week goes, it is about, you know, as, as, uh...

254
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,960
Well, but Talk Like a Pirate Day has not been endorsed by the state of California.

255
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,480
Talk Like a Pirate Day is an internet meme-y, basically, that's gone crazy.

256
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,480
Yeah, exactly.

257
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,800
Is it a 4chan thing?

258
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,080
It might as well be.

259
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,080
You know, it's one of those things.

260
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:38,560
But, I mean, it's basically about, you know, that important as far as, I mean, and I would

261
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,240
say even less important than Talk Like a Pirate Day because that's actually kind of cool,

262
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:49,160
but um, you know, it's about that important, like, you know, no one's gonna care.

263
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,720
I mean, they're not doing anything.

264
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,760
They're not punishing you for not cussing.

265
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,200
Most people don't even know that this is even happening.

266
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,200
Who cares?

267
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,360
Uh, comment from our chat room, Tigerclaw, and chat says, you know, this sucks for those

268
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,220
who do podcasts that live in California.

269
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,880
They won't be able to cuss on their show either, lol.

270
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,880
Hold on.

271
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,880
Hold on.

272
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,760
This is just an assembly thing that supports no cussing week.

273
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,440
Nobody can stop me from saying fuck, that's my first amendment right.

274
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,240
I can say fuck and I can say cunt and whole lots of worse words I can think of.

275
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,520
I can say them and nobody can take that right away because I live in America, which is great.

276
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:28,680
But I'm glad you brought that up because next week's show will fall during no cussing week.

277
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,760
So I do want to point out, we here at OLR, we do have our plan and we are going to bring

278
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,720
you, OLR presents our no cussing week show next week.

279
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,580
So we're looking very much forward to that.

280
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,920
So stay tuned.

281
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,120
So OLR celebrates no cussing week in the state of California next week.

282
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,120
It'll be fun.

283
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,600
But why are we giving them more fuel for, you know, their fire, you know what I mean?

284
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,600
It'll be fun.

285
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,920
We like to challenge ourselves here at Orange Lounge Radio.

286
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,020
Let's challenge ourselves with some video game news tonight, Loki.

287
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,120
I don't want to fucking do it.

288
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,720
Sorry, I have to get that out of there.

289
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,520
So this is kind of interesting.

290
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:19,520
Apparently the PS3 developers have now 70 megabytes of additional RAM unlocked to be

291
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,560
able to use in their games.

292
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:27,680
Sony apparently has been upgrading the PS3 over the past few months and doing so they've

293
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:36,540
dropped the OS's memory footprint from 120 megabytes to 50 megabytes and basically allowing

294
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:44,600
the system to use less RAM and therefore being able to pass on the RAM to other developers.

295
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,100
Now, is that going to really make a difference?

296
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,100
Probably not.

297
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:55,080
I mean, it'll help, you know, they want to optimize their code as much.

298
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,480
But you know, as PS3 developers have basically said, any bit of RAM helps.

299
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,480
So neat.

300
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:09,420
Yeah, I guess a little bit of RAM is better than none, but well, I mean, sorry, obviously

301
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,120
there is RAM in the system as it is, but you know what I mean?

302
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,720
The more RAM, the merrier.

303
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:19,240
But how is it that this console's been out for so long and now they're saying, hey, we've

304
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,240
unlocked this hidden RAM?

305
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,240
Is it just because they've optimized?

306
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,800
Yeah, they've just optimized their operating system.

307
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:32,360
They basically found new ways to do it for things and now, because it's optimized, they

308
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,320
don't need as much RAM.

309
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,620
But yeah, I wouldn't expect that suddenly all these games are going to have uber better

310
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,160
graphics and all this stuff.

311
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,120
I mean, 70 megs of RAM is not that much and all said and done.

312
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,440
So what, that's going to be like an extra, maybe an extra splish splash in the water

313
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,480
effect or an extra little dangling light somewhere in Silent Hill.

314
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:56,000
Anything I'm surprised they're not using it for like, you know, more, you know, features

315
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,600
in the operating system, you know, custom soundtracks in all the games, you know, cross

316
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:08,440
game chat, which I think is still there now, hopefully, you know, video chat or something

317
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,440
like that.

318
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,440
I don't know.

319
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,880
They could be using that RAM for something.

320
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,800
Or I don't know, let's see, these consoles, you know, have been out for a while and put

321
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:24,960
more RAM in them, you know, like gigs of RAM instead of like half a gig or whatever the

322
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,960
hell's in these.

323
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,360
I know it's not more than a gig.

324
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,360
It's poetic.

325
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:36,960
But they can't up it after the console's already out because then the games that are released

326
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,040
may not work on the older system.

327
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,720
So it's just like you have a new console out there.

328
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,720
Like remember, like I'm thinking of the Nintendo 64 memory pack.

329
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,320
Like, didn't you have to have that little memory pack in order to play like Majora's

330
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,320
Mask?

331
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,320
Is that a nice game with that?

332
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,680
Some games, yes.

333
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:55,760
But here's the thing is, like the PSP, they doubled the RAM that they have for their,

334
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,840
well, it's mainly for their web browser, but it can be done.

335
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,760
I mean, all it would do is those games would run smoother.

336
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,760
I see.

337
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,600
But games would still have to be optimized for the lowest common denominator, really.

338
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
Yes.

339
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,040
Or else they're going to find themselves in trouble.

340
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:18,280
But eventually they would phase that out, you know, phase out the old systems and all

341
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,400
right, well, one system that doesn't seem to be getting any upgrades in its near future

342
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,640
is the Nintendo Wii, but that doesn't stop Nintendo from trying to crank out the big,

343
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,640
big games.

344
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,840
And they had a big press event this week.

345
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,320
We're going to focus on the next few stories talking about for a moment.

346
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,180
And of course, some big, big titles coming out of this press event that happened this

347
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,180
week.

348
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:42,680
Two of them being Mario Galaxy 2 and Metroid Other M. Sounds like Super Mario Galaxy 2

349
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,600
and Metroid Other M are both going to be out mid-year, which was a little bit of a surprise

350
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,760
because I think a lot of us were thinking, even though Other M was shown at last E3,

351
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,920
we were kind of thinking, oh, it's early, it's going to be out this holiday season.

352
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,200
But no, both these games have now been dated for mid-year.

353
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,420
So Mario Galaxy 2, I believe they've said, they've even said like, what, May, I think,

354
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,400
and Metroid Other M is going to be out in June.

355
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
Yes.

356
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,400
So June 27th, which is the day after my birthday, I believe.

357
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,160
So, you know, it's kind of exciting these games are coming out so soon, but what's that

358
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,760
mean for the rest of the year?

359
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,800
What big titles does Nintendo have left?

360
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,920
They've already hinted that they're going to announce a new Zelda game that's going

361
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,920
to come out at the end of the year.

362
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,560
I mean, that's basically what's going to happen.

363
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:26,000
You're going to have a new Zelda game, probably running in the Twilight Princess engine.

364
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,120
And that'll be the new game this year, and everyone will go buck-a-wild over it.

365
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,960
So I guess some of the early impressions are out over these games, and Super Mario Galaxy

366
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,660
2 is pretty much Super Mario Galaxy 1, but some new worlds and new features and things.

367
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,040
Not a lot of differences, though.

368
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,320
It's not like the game has suddenly changed.

369
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,080
I don't think it has to be, I mean, really.

370
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,400
As long as it has B. Mario, who's going to care?

371
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:54,440
Really it was, you know, it was a good game, so you know, don't really need to change it.

372
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,480
Metroid Other M, on the other hand, finally we're getting some more details out of that,

373
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,960
and it does sound like it's going to be a direct sequel to Super Metroid, which you

374
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,540
know has me excited, because I think Super Metroid's the greatest game they ever made.

375
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:09,920
So hearing that this is a direct sequel, well, I do also approach that with caution, because

376
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,800
there's a part of me that goes, they could really screw this up.

377
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:18,540
But apparently they have a whole rendered scene of what happens at the end of Super

378
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:24,880
Metroid, is how the beginning of Other M starts, and it's all like rendered in the new 2 to

379
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,880
3D type thing.

380
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,840
I guess what happens in the game is that you play a lot of it in 2D, but you can actually

381
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,160
switch to 3D on a button press, which sounds kind of neat.

382
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,460
Is that the first person?

383
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:37,720
It's like Paper Mario or something, which is interesting.

384
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,760
So I'm certainly excited about Metroid Other M.

385
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,000
If it is mostly a 2D Metroid especially, I'm really excited.

386
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,680
I mean, I'm cool with them throwing some 3D in there a la Paper Mario, and you know, it's

387
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:55,520
not that Prime was bad, but it's just I love Super Metroid and can't wait to see a game

388
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,520
like that.

389
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,680
So I'm sure we'll see more details on this in the coming months, because this game is

390
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,680
going to be out now.

391
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,920
What, we're looking at March?

392
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,920
This game's out in three months?

393
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,920
Yeah.

394
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,920
Crazy.

395
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,920
So.

396
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,320
And actually we're getting linked to something on YouTube.

397
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,960
I'm hoping this isn't a joke, but it comes from Tiger Claw saying the Metroid Other M

398
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,640
intro video was apparently leaked.

399
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,040
Oh yeah, somebody's got their little camera here at the press conference.

400
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,400
So Tiger Claw just linked this in our chat room.

401
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,880
I'm trying to see, and I apologize because I know video doesn't make for great radio,

402
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,240
but okay, we see nebulas and clouds and all that stuff here.

403
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,120
Let me skip forward a little more in the video.

404
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,600
Now whoever's holding their camera's having to hold it a little low, but we do see kind

405
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,080
of like a rendered Samus in 3D action.

406
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,560
Those graphics look really good, especially for the Wii.

407
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,520
I know Nintendo's hoping this will be the game that changes people's minds.

408
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,440
Oh, there's the baby Metroid from the end of Super Metroid.

409
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,520
Isn't it cute?

410
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
And the mother brain.

411
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,680
Oh wow, that, that actually does look pretty impressive.

412
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,200
Oh, remember how the boss shot the laser from her eye and everything?

413
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,200
Interesting.

414
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,200
That's pretty cool.

415
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,800
Oh, whoever leaked that little piece of footage is going to get busted, but that's really

416
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,800
awesome.

417
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,800
That's cool.

418
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,760
If you want to check that out, the YouTube user that has this video posted right now

419
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,440
is MetroidBlaster127.

420
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,800
That's where we're, where we got linked to by our chat room.

421
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:28,320
I got to say, maybe this will be the game that changes people's minds on the Wii.

422
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,320
I don't know.

423
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,560
Well, or it's not necessarily my mind needs to be changed because Nintendo does put out

424
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,240
like that one or two awesome games a year.

425
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:44,000
If this does well, let's say a Team Ninja Zelda game or a Team Ninja Mario game.

426
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,440
Or just a third party with a sacred Nintendo franchise.

427
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,400
Or a Team Ninja Smash Brothers game.

428
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,400
Ah, hot.

429
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,280
That'd be very hot.

430
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,280
So we'll see.

431
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,240
That'll be out in June.

432
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,760
Unfortunately it's not going to be HD because the Wii doesn't support it, but...

433
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,760
Who cares?

434
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,760
It's good.

435
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,480
Yeah, it's, I got to say for 480p it still looks really good.

436
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,520
So we'll see.

437
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,520
We will see.

438
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,240
Well, let's move on with some more gaming news.

439
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,520
Dark Sakura.

440
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,200
Well, this is about the DSi XL.

441
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,920
We've got a date and a price for it.

442
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:20,720
It looks like it's going to be out on March 28th, going to be $190 and I'm pretty sure

443
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,760
I don't know if I'm going to get one.

444
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,640
Aren't they saying that a new DS is kind of rumored for E3 this year?

445
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,000
Like that could be one of the things that they announce?

446
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,080
Yeah, it's supposed to be one for $189.99.

447
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,720
I'm going to laugh if they do release a new one right after they do this.

448
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,120
Well, I know we've gotten into this on the show before.

449
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,200
They did the micro after the DS was announced.

450
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,200
I liked my micro.

451
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,600
I honestly don't think that they need to do another DS.

452
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:54,120
I mean, granted the XL, whatever, they, people might want a larger screen for something.

453
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:59,480
I don't know, they're kind of posing this as like a secondhand ebook reader or something

454
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,480
like that.

455
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,800
In fact, I think one of the new pieces of software they're going to have with this is

456
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,600
like some sort of classic novel collection or something like that.

457
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,880
That could be interesting.

458
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,880
I would get that.

459
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,420
And then again, I use my Kindle.

460
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,700
It wasn't this game.

461
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:17,720
There was actually a, or it wasn't the DSi XL that was necessarily kind of cool.

462
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:24,280
There was a, I want to say it's a new DSiWare game that's going to be coming out where it's

463
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:29,240
like a hidden pictures game that you have to search for different letters in this like

464
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,240
scene.

465
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,840
But what's kind of cool about it though is they almost do like a pseudo head tracking

466
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,440
with it using the camera.

467
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,960
You actually tilt the system around and the camera changes angles based on how you have

468
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,960
the system tilted.

469
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,600
Why don't they do this technology with like DSi that might make it a lot cooler with new

470
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,400
different games coming out that you have this neat little kind of head tracking technology

471
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,400
built in.

472
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:56,280
You know, that would be really cool and kind of a way to differentiate themselves with

473
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,280
DSi.

474
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,520
Because right now it's like, eh, it's a DS with a camera.

475
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,880
They don't like to give us what we want.

476
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,580
You know, another big problem with this is the price.

477
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,760
I mean $200, right, or $190 or whatever it is.

478
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:14,040
Something like that is supposed to be like $20 more than what the DSi is now.

479
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,040
Yeah.

480
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,160
But now you're also talking, you could get a Wii for the same price, right, or at least

481
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:23,680
an Xbox 360 low end, right, for $199.

482
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,760
So I don't know.

483
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,040
I'm not really sold on, again, why I need the DSi XL.

484
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,520
I don't have a DSi.

485
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,520
I don't have one.

486
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,400
I have the DS Lite, was the last Nintendo system I bought.

487
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,640
And I probably wouldn't have even bought that if I hadn't kind of bought it as like a knee

488
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,000
jerk thing when I was on vacation once.

489
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,160
I would still have my DS back.

490
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:46,820
This is really dumb that it's coming out for a price point that's higher than the DSi.

491
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,000
Really what they should have done is drop the price of both systems.

492
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,920
Maybe put out the DSi XL at the price of the current DSi and drop the price of the DSi.

493
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:59,220
But even then it's like, well, do I really need a larger screen?

494
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:04,960
It doesn't really enhance anything other than the graphics are slightly bigger now.

495
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,960
I don't know.

496
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,080
I think it's kind of unnecessary.

497
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:13,120
I guess this whole ebook thing you're talking about could be interesting, but is it something

498
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,680
that I would not be able to use on the DSi regular?

499
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,680
No.

500
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,120
No, you wouldn't be able to, but it'd just be slightly bigger on the, you know, and we're

501
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,480
talking slightly bigger.

502
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,640
I mean, it's not like the screen size is like double or triple of what the DSi is.

503
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,120
It's still enough to fit in your pocket, right?

504
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:30,980
It didn't really give me an impression of being anything that fantastic.

505
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:35,800
I just, I don't understand the point of this.

506
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:40,800
Ooh, maybe they're in pretty colors because that would be a big seller as if they're in

507
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,000
like, you know, fabulous pink and sexy lavender.

508
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,360
I don't know what the colors are going to be, but I think from what we've seen in the

509
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,520
pictures is like they have like a wine burgundy color.

510
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,040
Yeah, and another one's bronze.

511
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,000
I'd get a bronze one.

512
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:02,720
It's so like a third place looking color and then a Franzia looking color.

513
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,240
Really, if you want a DSi in a specific color, there are websites out there that will give

514
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:12,000
you a DSi in any color you want, or you can go to the Nintendo World store in New York

515
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,640
and they'll give you a DSi color.

516
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,680
I almost did that.

517
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:20,080
They had like the custom DS cases and this like really there was a sexy metallic green

518
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,080
one.

519
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,080
I kind of wanted, but I resisted.

520
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,680
I didn't buy it almost as you should have because you probably already have a DS and

521
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,040
there's no reason to purchase something because of a color.

522
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,640
There really wasn't, except the fact that it was one of the lights and I didn't have

523
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,140
a light at that time.

524
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,140
So I almost bought that.

525
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:46,360
I did buy my, now I can't remember which letter is attached to it, my pink one because it

526
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,360
was pink.

527
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,360
I do feel a little...

528
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:52,720
And I wanted to be different than what people expect.

529
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,760
Mine are very generic.

530
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,360
My DS fat is gray and my DS light is black.

531
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,760
It's not my DS, my old SP, not the SP, the one before that.

532
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,600
But I feel a little ridiculous having both of them at this point.

533
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,960
I'm like, I just need to like sell one of these, but who'd buy it?

534
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,440
Do what we do.

535
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,560
Get another room.

536
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,680
I don't have another room.

537
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,680
I just moved.

538
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,680
I had to downsize.

539
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,680
I don't have as much room as I had before.

540
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,520
I got boxes everywhere still.

541
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,400
I need to get rid of things.

542
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,560
Take my DS to the dump.

543
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,320
All right, let's move on with some more news.

544
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,320
Okay.

545
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,040
So some other interesting stuff that came out of the media summit, Nintendo will be

546
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:31,180
publishing Dragon Quest IX in North America.

547
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:35,200
Which is kind of weird if you think about it, because Square Enix is over here.

548
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,600
Why aren't they publishing the game?

549
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,520
But hey, whatever.

550
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,440
It's coming out over here sometime in the summer.

551
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:46,240
And you know, with Nintendo being the one that's publishing the game, hopefully there'll

552
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,880
be a better marketing campaign behind it.

553
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,340
So maybe that's good.

554
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:56,400
And because people buy blindly whatever Nintendo puts out, so that's always good.

555
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:03,200
Another game scheduled for May coming to the DS would be Picross 3D.

556
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,360
And kind of a cool-looking game.

557
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,600
And of course, you know, Picross is kind of a puzzle game where you make a picture.

558
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:16,440
Well, now it's going to be in three dimensions as well, and you'll break apart cubes to reveal

559
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,980
different little cube animals and objects and stuff.

560
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,920
So that's kind of neat.

561
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:28,560
Kind of a more niche game, but Sin and Punishment 2, or what's being called over here, Sin and

562
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,840
Punishment Star Successor will be coming out on June 7th.

563
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:37,160
They had a new trailer for it as well, and it looks all sorts of sexy, and of course

564
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:43,660
it's a shooter game that will be the sequel to the one that came out on Nintendo 64 way

565
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,960
back in the day.

566
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,960
But not in America.

567
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,880
Not in America, no, that's true.

568
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:52,440
And looks pretty cool, kind of reminded me of some Panzer Dragon stuff on there.

569
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:58,600
So and then of course, WiiWare, right around the corner actually, Cave Story will be making

570
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:06,920
its way out on WiiWare March 22nd with slightly upgraded graphics, and looks kind of neat.

571
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:12,240
Also there's going to be some download content as well being available, including a new boss

572
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,560
rush and sanctuary time attack mode that will be available to download.

573
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:23,320
Huh, oh, I guess I take that back.

574
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,680
I misread that.

575
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:28,000
It was originally announced as download content, now it's being included.

576
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,760
So you get it for free.

577
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,520
Well extra stuff for free is always good.

578
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,520
Definitely.

579
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:38,880
So, any news that particularly got you excited at the Nintendo conference?

580
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,560
I know we've kind of touched on most of the stuff.

581
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:52,320
There was some other interesting stuff, like regarding Monster Hunter Tri, or I guess they're

582
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:57,680
calling it Monster Hunter Tri or whatever, but we'll talk a little bit more about that

583
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,680
later.

584
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,680
Gotcha.

585
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:04,920
I'm just, I was very interested to see that both Mario Galaxy and Metroid Other M are

586
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:11,040
coming out in the second quarter, which is really unheard of that they would put both

587
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,680
of those blockbuster games, because it's like, well crap, if you're putting out these two

588
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:19,560
games now, then what the hell do you have for, you know, holiday?

589
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,560
A new Zelda, OMG!

590
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,840
Oh yeah, it's pretty much a new Zelda game.

591
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,800
Well and then whatever they're going to show at E3 that might be the surprise, but that's

592
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,160
probably the Zelda game that's not much of a surprise at this point.

593
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:33,400
Remember, and I know I've said this on a show before, but New Super Mario Brothers Wii was

594
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,200
kept under wraps until E3, it was really the surprise.

595
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,760
Because remember the way that whole press conference went, like last year's E3 was supposed

596
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,920
to be kind of like this apology for the year before, and last year's E3, they came out

597
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:51,160
within five minutes, they were on New Super Mario Brothers Wii, and they're like, hey,

598
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:55,080
it's a New Super Mario Brothers game that looks and kind of plays like the old school

599
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:59,040
one, and this is what gamers want, dah dah dah, and guess what, it's out this holiday.

600
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,040
Woohoo!

601
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,800
And that was one of the big things they showed on the floor.

602
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:07,080
You know, I'm thinking there could be another like Gotcha this year from Nintendo, except

603
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,240
I worry it might be the Zelda game that's already kind of leaked out.

604
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,320
I'm guessing it's going to be like a Pikmin 3, probably the new Zelda game.

605
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,760
Wii Relax, which will be retarded, but it'll probably come out around October-ish, I think

606
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,320
around the same time as Wii Fit Plus did this year, and I think they'll probably treat it

607
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,320
as- Oh, the Vitality?

608
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,880
Yeah, I think they'll probably treat it as much, you know, like the Wii Fit Plus.

609
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:35,600
Not a lot of, I mean, probably not going to do as well as Wii Fit, you know, in general.

610
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:40,440
I just don't see the need for that little Vitality sensor, but whatever.

611
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:46,640
It would be really cool though, is to do like a new Zelda game, but like, you know, like

612
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:51,600
new Super Mario Brothers style, where it's old school Zelda, but like four player and

613
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,600
teaming up.

614
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,600
So, the four swords.

615
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,720
Something like that, yeah.

616
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,280
I want a lethargy sensor.

617
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,000
How about a Wii Vitality sensor that shocks you?

618
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,480
You're not moving!

619
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,480
Clear!

620
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,480
Fang!

621
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:08,280
Or just something like when you screw up in the game, it gives you a little bite of electricity

622
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,280
or something.

623
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,280
I don't know.

624
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,280
Could be fun.

625
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,280
Maybe a new Wario War game.

626
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,680
That could be, or the fanboy in me would love to see an F-Zero game come out of nowhere.

627
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,680
Oh god, that'd be awesome.

628
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,480
I'm not going to hold my breath though, but that would be the whoa crap game for me.

629
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,400
I'm still holding out for an Excite Truck 2.

630
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,840
You know, a real Excite Truck 2, not this Excite Bots bullshit.

631
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,840
Who knows?

632
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,840
Anything's possible.

633
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,840
Alright, well let's move on to some other platforms, obviously a big game going on right

634
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:40,560
now is Heavy Rain on the Playstation 3, which sadly I have not gotten my hands on yet amongst

635
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,440
all my real life stuff going on, but I do want to play it at some point, although I

636
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,240
heard, and this is kind of like breaking news as we're taping live on this Sunday, I heard

637
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:51,180
something about Playstation Network is down right now, I guess, and if you want to play

638
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,040
Heavy Rain, you can't.

639
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,740
Like I don't know how that works.

640
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,280
Does the game talk to the servers somehow?

641
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,600
Like you have to be online?

642
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:04,200
I don't see how it could because, you know, what if you don't have an internet connection

643
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,320
and you can't play the game?

644
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,320
I don't know.

645
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,320
Apparently something was going on.

646
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:14,640
I guess there's some game crashing errors going on on the PSN and it has something to

647
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,480
do with the dates reverting and now some of the data's corrupting or something.

648
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:23,560
And yeah, the issues are preventing folks from launching games like Heavy Rain, so it

649
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:27,440
sounds like the date or something might have got screwed up and now it's messing everyone

650
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,440
up.

651
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,440
I wonder how that works.

652
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,440
Yikes.

653
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,360
Well, hopefully that's fixed soon.

654
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:36,440
But meanwhile, Heavy Rain was banned in another country this week.

655
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,040
United Arab Emirates.

656
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,800
You will not be able to play Heavy Rain.

657
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,680
It's an official ban there.

658
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,160
So if you are in the Middle East and you want to play this game, you're going to have to

659
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:51,120
import it or something because the game was banned by the country's National Media Council.

660
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:55,400
Of course, Sony has come out and said, you know, the game is an 18 plus game.

661
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:01,080
It is strong content, but they didn't really respond to this particular ban.

662
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,600
So I have a feeling they might just cut their losses since unfortunately for anybody listening

663
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,920
who might be in the UAE, it's not one of Sony's biggest markets, so they might just be cutting

664
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,040
their losses and hoping you guys will import it.

665
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,800
I don't know.

666
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,760
But it wasn't banned because of the bugs.

667
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,080
Apparently there's some bugs going on in Heavy Rain.

668
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,300
It has to do with just some technical things.

669
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,680
Some audio is out of sync.

670
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,320
The game is freezing up.

671
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,500
There are some auto saves that turn out they can't load and for some reason everybody's

672
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,360
speaking French.

673
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,760
I'm just kidding about the last one sort of, but the rest, the rest is all, well, you've

674
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,300
heard about like how Heavy Rain was made in France and was developed by a French studio.

675
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,100
So they have all these French voice actors, but they're doing English and apparently the

676
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,320
accent is really noticeable.

677
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,320
Really noticeable.

678
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,080
The PlayStation network actually got hacked because on their website there is a directory

679
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:55,420
called Dear PlayStation that says get flash and or enable JavaScript and stop wasting

680
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,200
my time.

681
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,760
Interesting.

682
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,920
That's funny.

683
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,920
Yikes.

684
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,320
So PSN might be the victim of a hack going on right now.

685
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,480
So yeah, the game is locking up and so forth.

686
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:13,560
So I guess Sony has kind of posted in their forums about it saying that they are aware

687
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,900
of some of the issues and if you're having a particular issue, you should go to the thread

688
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:21,800
and post your information because you know, this is the era of patching video games that

689
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,800
are already broken.

690
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,320
Isn't Sony the same service that's running a show right now about finding a video game

691
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,320
tester?

692
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,320
I'm going to talk about this more in part B.

693
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,320
Yes, they are.

694
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,960
Sony might need some more video game testers right now, so maybe you all win.

695
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,000
Maybe everybody needs to win that show and go test Heavy Rain.

696
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I don't know.

697
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,600
I will talk more about the tester in part B. I have a lot of thoughts on that, so we'll

698
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,040
get into that a little later on in the program.

699
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:48,600
But for now, more gaming news from Dark Soccer and then the release dates in a little bit.

700
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,320
Oh, release dates.

701
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,320
I'm looking forward.

702
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:55,440
But instead, this is not something that anyone should be looking forward to.

703
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,100
It's pretty, pretty bad.

704
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:05,800
There are 12 game stores, as in a big retailer in the UK.

705
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:11,440
Actually more than that, 43 are going to be closing down in the UK.

706
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,120
That means that 247 people are going to be laid off.

707
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:23,840
Or as the article says, will be a redundant, which I think is a horrible term.

708
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,240
Also...

709
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,160
Well that's what they call it over there though, redundancies, right?

710
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,160
I know.

711
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,160
I just think it's awful.

712
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,520
It's just a terrible word.

713
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:35,640
You know, hi, you're redundant, okay?

714
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,920
Whose fault is that for creating a redundant position?

715
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,720
The same guy who's probably laying me off.

716
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:48,080
Well that's going to be a third of the stores out of a total of 682.

717
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:55,280
So it's including 12 game stores and 6 game station outlets and 25 Debenham's stores.

718
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,160
The little concessions.

719
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:02,960
And just so folks not in the UK know, the store is actually called Game.

720
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,560
So when you say a game store, you're not being vague.

721
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,560
It's actually G-A-M-E.

722
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,560
All caps.

723
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,560
All caps, trademark, restricted.

724
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,480
Would you say, and I'm not familiar, would you say, Jamie, that's kind of like their

725
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,480
version of GameStop?

726
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,440
Like that's their big, big industry there?

727
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,960
I'd say it's a big one.

728
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,960
That would be...

729
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,760
Can you imagine if like a bunch of GameStops here shut down?

730
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,160
Although I guess what we've had the news about GameCrazy and some of the competitors.

731
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,160
Don't get me started on that, please.

732
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,320
I know, I'm sorry.

733
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,320
But you know, it's...

734
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,920
A bunch of GameStops closed?

735
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,320
Wow, then there'd be an adequate number of GameStops available because right now there's

736
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,320
way too many.

737
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,600
Yeah, they're totally cornering the market, which I think is disgusting.

738
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,560
Don't we have antitrust laws and stuff in this?

739
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,560
Yeah, we do.

740
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,560
But Google's not listening.

741
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,560
I mean, GameStop's not listening.

742
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,560
Did I say Google?

743
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,560
Yeah, you said Google.

744
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,560
Yeah, well Google's on the list too.

745
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,560
Google's always listening.

746
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,760
Now, Google's just been on a decline in the past couple of years.

747
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,760
Like I'm a big Google...

748
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,640
Google's being sued for violation of antitrust.

749
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:01,760
Well, you know, I'm a big Google fan, but I'm sorry, Wave was what?

750
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,720
We don't need Google Mars.

751
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,720
And Buzz was bad.

752
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,720
Did you know about that?

753
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,720
Did you know about Google Mars?

754
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,720
Google Mars.

755
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,720
That's the maps on Mars, right?

756
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,720
Yes.

757
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,720
I think that's cool.

758
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,720
It's cool, but it doesn't look very good.

759
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,720
And why do we need to...

760
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,600
Can't we just go to NASA's website or something?

761
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,480
I'm okay with Google Mars.

762
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,320
You know, it's Earth in the style...

763
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,520
But it's Mars in the style of Google Earth.

764
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,520
I'm okay with that.

765
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,520
What about Google Veronica Mars?

766
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,520
Buzz!

767
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,520
Google Veronica Mars would be cool.

768
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,520
I don't need that for that.

769
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,960
Buzz was bad.

770
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,280
Buzz was a bad idea.

771
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,280
What was Buzz?

772
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,280
I didn't hear about that.

773
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:37,520
It was their response to Twitter, but the problem was it automatically added the 40

774
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:42,080
most common people you email to your Buzz friends list, and if somebody went to your

775
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:45,760
public profile, they could see the 40 people you email the most.

776
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:51,760
So if one of them happens to be like an ex, or, you know, a boss is emailing his secretary

777
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,000
on a personal email, everybody could see that.

778
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Or a porn finder.

779
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Exactly.

780
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,360
Like, whoever thought that was a good idea needs to be made redundant.

781
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,360
Honestly.

782
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,040
Well, if they were going to do something like that, they should have it as an option that

783
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,040
you could select.

784
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,040
It's ridiculous.

785
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:12,040
Well, now they backtracked, but they botched the launch of that thing, and now nobody's

786
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,040
going to trust it.

787
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,400
So they might as well just nuke Buzz, nuke Wave, and start again.

788
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,400
Google Buzz Wave.

789
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,440
I am sick of the social networking, by the way.

790
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,720
It's like I was posting on my Facebook earlier.

791
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,760
I'm sick of social networking, yet I'm compelled to still do it.

792
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,760
I am, too.

793
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,800
You know, Tangent Train, choo choo.

794
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,800
Okay.

795
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:37,440
There's this whole email that came out this week from Bizarre Creations, who's a studio

796
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,440
I really respect.

797
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,440
They're great.

798
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,440
They make a lot of great stuff.

799
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,340
And I'm really looking forward to Blur.

800
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:45,560
Just as a gamer, that was one of the fun games I played at E3.

801
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:50,720
But they were talking about how they have fully integrated Twitter into Blur, and how

802
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,520
you can actually tweet while driving in Blur.

803
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:58,760
And not just necessarily making, and I apologize because I don't have the press release in

804
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:02,480
front of me, so I hope I'm not misstating anything, but I believe it was so far as,

805
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:07,920
you can hit the left bumper, and you can automatically send to your Twitter what you are doing in

806
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:08,920
Blur.

807
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,580
That's just ridiculous.

808
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:13,960
And I'm just thinking, okay, I get what they're trying to do.

809
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:18,560
Like here at OLR, we try to embrace all social networking when it comes out, because we want

810
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,920
to be where every gamer has a voice, and we want people to interact with us.

811
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,680
And I get that Bizzare is trying to be on the cutting edge.

812
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,760
So for that, I say, okay, cool.

813
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,880
But there's the other part of me that goes, God, as if Twitter didn't have enough bullshit

814
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,880
on it already.

815
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,440
Like, honestly, guys, I'm just straight up with this whole social networking thing.

816
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,760
And I've told people this.

817
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:41,840
If you post important news about your life on Facebook, and are going to give me a pop

818
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:46,640
quiz on it later, or expect me to know that like you are getting engaged because the only

819
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,840
place you said anything was Facebook, I'm sorry.

820
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,840
That doesn't fly with me.

821
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:56,360
Like, if you want me to know what's going on with you, text, email, you know, I like

822
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:00,300
to think those are kind of modern things or call, pick up the phone, dial the numbers

823
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,520
and call.

824
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,520
You know what?

825
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,520
I have to read this list.

826
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:10,280
And as a poster that was done by the oatmeal, the 10 things you need to stop tweeting about.

827
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,280
Have you seen that Rob?

828
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,280
No, I have not.

829
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,680
One, what are you eating?

830
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,120
I had meatloaf for breakfast, lol please RT.

831
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:22,400
Social media, the conference or event that you're at.

832
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,400
Twitter itself.

833
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,360
Well, now wait a minute though, because Twitter, like we did the tweet thing for me three and

834
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:30,440
I think a lot of people like that because we were pictures in the, that was reporting

835
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,660
news.

836
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:37,840
This example is using, it's like a total, so and so totally owned that last session

837
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,720
on optimizing your Twitter background pic.

838
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,720
I get what you're saying.

839
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,720
You know what?

840
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,760
There's a girl on my friends list and I love her to death.

841
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:50,000
I think she's amazing, but she posts so many updates whenever she's at like a concert for

842
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,220
a former American Idol or something like it just fills up my page and I can't see anybody

843
00:44:55,220 --> 00:45:00,400
else's list and I'm kind of just thinking like, can you post a live journal or somewhere

844
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,400
where you can make long posts?

845
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:06,000
The other one on here is your workout, your kid, dog, cat, goat or whatever else.

846
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,940
Speaking out of context, as in people who just say nonsense, daily booth photos, emotional

847
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:15,880
breakthroughs and the number of like posting the daily picture of yourself.

848
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,280
Oh, like where it's the same picture of me every day flexing and looking cute.

849
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,280
Yeah.

850
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,280
Okay.

851
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,280
Emotional breakthroughs and the number of followers you have.

852
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,280
Oh yeah.

853
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,680
That's, and that's, that's so tacky when somebody posts like, I have a thousand followers.

854
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,000
Well, I'll have to tell you, now you don't.

855
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,800
Now you have nine 99 click.

856
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:38,040
I have to tell you the, what, what hit me today and I actually, I use Twitter now for

857
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:41,120
more of a professional networking.

858
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,460
I follow a lot of other designers.

859
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:47,880
I follow people in the comic book industry and I actually get something out of, you know,

860
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:52,320
and yeah, it's not that I don't care about the people on Twitter.

861
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,440
You know what I mean?

862
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,980
It's just that I really don't need to know how big of a poop you took or I, you know,

863
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:02,080
I'm sure your baby is cute, but I would rather have something meaningful.

864
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:05,920
I honestly, I feel like the biggest hypocrite when it comes to Twitter because most of the

865
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,200
stuff I tweet these days have to do with video games and I kind of use it like for OLR related

866
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,920
things and to keep tabs on the OLR fans.

867
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,440
But I, I don't like reading that stuff.

868
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,480
Like when I look at my fans list and it's, it's like a bunch of other podcasters promoting

869
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,480
their shows.

870
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,820
I'm like, yeah, okay, I know you have a show.

871
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:22,820
I get it.

872
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:27,980
But as in here I am tweeting, Hey, listen to OLR tonight, you know, Twitter makes me

873
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:28,980
feel dirty.

874
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:32,400
Well, let's just say, you know, we, we have problems with it yet.

875
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,800
We feel compelled to use it, right?

876
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,960
Because it is now a part of our culture.

877
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:44,320
If you think about it, it's really, uh, why it's not cool anymore.

878
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:49,980
In Facebook, I have a little bit more love for because I use that as my mini blog.

879
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:53,320
That's actually, I go back and check on it cause I usually just put my to do list up

880
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,320
there.

881
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,000
Like what do I need to get done today and refer back to it.

882
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,360
But I've actually not even been, you know, I'm actually making a conscious effort not

883
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:03,640
to use either of them so much and actually keep a notebook with me and use my live journal

884
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:04,960
and my blog.

885
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,960
Well the thing that freaks me out is that like CNN uses Twitter as like a real source

886
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:10,960
now.

887
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,800
And that kind of weirds me out a little bit.

888
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:18,160
Like when, when boner died this week, right here, the celebrity from, he was boner on

889
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,160
growing pains.

890
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,160
Chekhov's kid.

891
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,160
Yeah.

892
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,160
Oh yeah.

893
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,160
Chekhov's kid.

894
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,680
Um, you know, unfortunately very tragic, sad, you know, what have you.

895
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:32,880
But CNN went to Twitter to see what all the other celebrities who knew him like Kirk Cameron

896
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,800
and you know, the people that would have worked with him before were saying about him.

897
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,160
And I don't know, like I just, I read the story and I just kind of thought whatever

898
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:45,860
happened to like, he's um, he does a lot of Jesus stuff.

899
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:50,460
Like you would find his works at the Bible houses and yeah, those types of places.

900
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:56,120
But anyway, uh, he was in the, um, movie for, uh, left behind, left behind.

901
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,600
I keep thinking left for dead.

902
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,600
No, not that movie.

903
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,600
That's a different movie.

904
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,600
Left behind.

905
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:01,600
That's it.

906
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,600
The rapture movie.

907
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,600
Yeah.

908
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:08,000
But my whole thing is that CNN is running this report about what all the celebs on Twitter

909
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,600
are saying and I can't help but think like whatever happened to actual reporting?

910
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,600
I know.

911
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,600
Well, this is, this is my thought.

912
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,680
Like I can use Google and Twitter.

913
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:22,180
Is it when they're doing editorials and when it get like a viewer feedback?

914
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,180
That's a good thing.

915
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:26,540
You know, the same reason why we have the chat room, you know, when we talk about an

916
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:30,240
actual story and we want to see what people think about it, it's, I think, look at it

917
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:34,700
as that equivalent, but in, it's a fine line.

918
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:39,920
It's a really fine line and you know, that's why I think there's legitimate uses for it.

919
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,960
I think, you know, a lot of people honestly are using it to validate themselves.

920
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:49,160
Whereas, you know, if, if you want to share something important with people, it's a good

921
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,160
way to do it.

922
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,680
If you want to see what other people are doing in your industry, it's a good thing to find

923
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,700
out other people that are in your industry.

924
00:48:55,700 --> 00:49:01,280
But I'm really just getting like a, like so tired of the, Oh, I had to poop today.

925
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,280
Yeah.

926
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,280
Yeah.

927
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,400
Nobody's going to retweet you and then say, I'm so glad your colon is working properly.

928
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,200
You know, some people do reply to that.

929
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,540
Don't, don't get me started.

930
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:16,320
And yeah, I've, I've posted really inane stuff on there too, but I actually just, uh, detached

931
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:24,240
my, uh, loud Twitter feed from my live journal and I, cause of the, whatever, yay.

932
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,320
Last thing I hate most about Twitter is that it's invading live journal.

933
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,320
Yay.

934
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,320
Gold star for Jamie.

935
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,360
I'm so happy.

936
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:34,560
Over the last few weeks, I would just go back and check my loud Twitter feed and like I

937
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:38,840
posted one thing, why?

938
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:43,080
I just now do it to keep up with other people, you know, or if I have something to announce,

939
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:48,320
like that's important, like come to my birthday party or I'm going to be going to LA.

940
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,120
I would like to meet up with my friends there.

941
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,680
That type of thing.

942
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:56,360
That's a little bit more reasonable instead of, Oh, um, I had some, uh, we'd a Bix for

943
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,360
breakfast.

944
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,360
Yeah.

945
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,360
I don't know.

946
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:02,000
I know we're on this big tangent with social networking, but it's just, it's, we're in

947
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,520
a weird place right now where it's, it's kind of like the honeymoon phase is over with the

948
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,520
Twitter and the Facebook.

949
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:10,360
And now it's like, okay, I'm linking this poster to the chat room.

950
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,600
If you have some thoughts, why not email them to us?

951
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:16,560
Mailbag orange launch radio.com or we'll probably get some phone calls on it later in the show

952
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:19,960
for now though, we want to get to the classic game of the week, but not before we do release

00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,200
and PSP.

970
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:37,000
Um, battle of giants, mutant insects, kind of a little fighting game from Ubisoft, uh,

971
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,000
battlefield bad company two coming out on PlayStation three X-Box three 60 and PC this

972
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:49,440
week silent hunter five battle of the Atlantic coming out on PC.

973
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:54,880
Supreme commander two coming out from square Enix on PC as well.

974
00:51:54,880 --> 00:52:02,720
And lips party classics coming out on X-Box three 60 and that is it.

975
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,600
I saw a new commercial for lips this week that I guess uses Lily Allen sort of as the

976
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,160
centerpiece of it.

977
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,160
Yeah.

978
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,720
I wasn't that impressed.

979
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,200
I don't know.

980
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:17,240
I guess I'm, maybe I'm just, I'm surprised anybody buys lips to be honest.

981
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,240
Well I buy sink star.

982
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:22,640
I mean, yeah, but I understand seeing star cause there's an actual following for that,

983
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,880
but lips is not so much.

984
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,000
It's like they're trying to keep putting game.

985
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,040
I think lips was kind of put out as a response to sing star.

986
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,720
You know, if lips had come first, I probably would have been on the lips.

987
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,480
It's just seeing star seems to be easier to use.

988
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:38,000
Well seeing star also has like the real, well I guess lips does too.

989
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I don't know.

990
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I know seeing star like it just has all the real videos integrated and you know, it's

991
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,100
a really great party game, but it does too.

992
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:48,440
But the thing I thought with lips was it was supposed to be able to integrate any music

993
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:52,480
that you had in kind of turned into a karaoke version, but.

994
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:53,480
I believe it does.

995
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:54,480
It's just kind of wonky.

996
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:59,180
It's not the greatest implementation, you know, it's basically using one of those.

997
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:03,440
You can use a filter in like Adobe audition to take out vocals too, but it's, it's a little

998
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,440
hit and miss.

999
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:08,240
There's even some MP3 plugins that do that for Winamp, but it's a little hit and miss

1000
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,920
cause it's just looking, I don't know how the science of it works, but it looks at a

1001
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,960
certain component of the track of the song and kind of removes it and sometimes it works

1002
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,960
and sometimes it doesn't.

1003
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:18,960
Oh well.

1004
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:24,520
Anyhow, moving on to the Xbox 360 in Japan and looking at Japanese release dates.

1005
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:30,240
Bioshock 2 comes out this week on March 4th as well as Nobunaga no Yabutendo comes out

1006
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,360
and I believe that was on the PS3 a couple weeks ago cause I seem to remember talking

1007
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,360
about that game before.

1008
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:38,880
But yeah, localized version of Bioshock 2 also on the 360 this week in Japan.

1009
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,880
Moving on to the PlayStation 3, no there's Nobunaga no Yabutendo again, so maybe it was

1010
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,480
pushed back a little, I don't know.

1011
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:50,440
But there it is on the PlayStation 3, also Bioshock 2 on the PlayStation 3 as well.

1012
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:53,020
Maybe this is actually, you know what this is, no this is different.

1013
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:56,660
This is not the Dynasty Warriors, this actually looks like Nobunaga's Ambition.

1014
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:58,920
This looks like a next gen version of it.

1015
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:02,520
You know, I can't read the Japanese, but just looking at the interface, it looks like they're

1016
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:05,500
picking the different city layouts and so forth.

1017
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:11,360
So if you know the Nobunaga Ambition series of games, I don't know how to explain it in

1018
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,360
a nutshell.

1019
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:17,920
It's basically an RTS-ish kind of game that's about Japanese feudalism, I guess is the easiest

1020
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,240
way for me to sum it up.

1021
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,800
It's a feudal Japan sim.

1022
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:25,560
I liked the old school one on the NES, but boy that game's evolved quickly over time.

1023
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:30,360
That one on PlayStation 2 a few years back, that was the last one I remembered that came

1024
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,360
out over here.

1025
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,360
Oh there's a new one coming out.

1026
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:36,440
On the Nintendo Wii, nothing this week believe it or not, but next week Taiko no Tatsujin,

1027
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:39,800
I know our music game fans might be familiar with that one, Taiko no Tatsujin makes its

1028
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,320
way to the Wii next week, and that's March 11th, not this week.

1029
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,320
Is that another one?

1030
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,320
Like a sequel?

1031
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,320
Because I thought they had one over there already.

1032
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,960
I thought they had one there already too, but this must be, uh...

1033
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,200
Is this the one with the inflatable drum?

1034
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,900
I believe it is.

1035
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:56,560
Or this could also be a price reduction, or it could be the game, because yeah, they're

1036
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,560
only...

1037
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:05,680
I think this is maybe the game by itself without the drum, is probably what it is.

1038
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:09,200
On the PlayStation 2 this week, nothing, again nothing.

1039
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:13,440
On the Nintendo DS though, a lot of Dragon Quest games are going into the Ultimate Hits

1040
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:20,920
collection, that would be 4, 9, and 5 all get price reductions from Squeenix as well

1041
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:24,880
as Final Fantasy 4, so it's a big week for price reductions.

1042
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:31,080
Otherwise, there is Bomberman Touchland, Star Bomber No Miracle World gets a price reduction

1043
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:35,640
as well, and probably a big, big release this week in Japan, which is why everything else

1044
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:42,040
is kind of limited this week, Pokemon Ranger, Hikari no Kiseki comes out this week.

1045
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:49,560
This is different, this is not like the gold and silver in those games, but yeah, it's

1046
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,560
a new Pokemon game.

1047
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:51,560
I think that's what that means.

1048
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:55,880
Here's the little description here, the Pokemon nappers are catching Pokemon and involving

1049
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:04,800
them in shady activities, there are more than 300 species of Pokeporns, most of them you've

1050
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:08,960
seen in HeartGold and Silver, and then you tame them and you can get them to join you

1051
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,520
in battle, but it's not, like I'm just looking at the screenshots, it's not the same type

1052
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:17,680
of game as the other games, this looks a little more action-y, actually, for some reason.

1053
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,000
Like a tactics game?

1054
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:24,320
No, it looks like it's almost like mini-games, see how it's kind of like first person, flight

1055
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:28,440
type of game there, and then this one looks like some type of running, this one looks

1056
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:31,520
like they're drawing on the DS screen.

1057
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:36,200
It looks like it's almost like a mix of mini-games and Pokemon or something.

1058
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,320
So there you go.

1059
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:46,760
Lastly on the PSP,.hack//Link comes out on the PSP, that's another big release, so check

1060
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:47,760
that out.

1061
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:52,640
If you're a fan of the.hack// series, the PSP gets a new.hack// game this week.

1062
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:57,600
They call it the grand finale you've all been waiting for.

1063
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,600
Good luck.

1064
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,560
Let's move to the UK, DarkSakura.

1065
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,560
I'd like to.

1066
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,560
Can we move there?

1067
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:07,240
Um, no, I can't afford it.

1068
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,240
Damn, okay.

1069
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:14,720
Well, on the 3rd of March we have Toy Soldiers, on the 5th we have Alice in Wonderland, and

1070
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:21,760
then Assassin's Creed 2 for PC, Battlefield Bad Company 2, BlazBlue Calamity Trigger,

1071
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:29,840
Dementium 2 on the DS, Picross 3D, Silent Hunter 5 by Ubisoft, and Supreme Hunter 2,

1072
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:35,040
and Sushi Go Round for the DS and the Wii.

1073
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,040
Sushi.

1074
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,040
Yay, Sushi.

1075
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:41,560
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys and then we're going to get into the

1076
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:44,840
classic game of the week and I'll just give you a little hint.

1077
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:47,920
I'm not going to give away what DarkSakura's picked, I'm just going to say it's really

1078
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:48,920
old.

1079
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:52,760
But that's not a bad thing.

1080
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,760
Oh yeah.

1081
00:57:54,760 --> 00:58:01,640
So apparently Activision is being sued for false patent marketing and what that is is

1082
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:09,060
basically that Activision is filing patents for its products that are beyond the scope

1083
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:13,760
of what it's producing, for example.

1084
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:22,280
There's patent 753, which is basically a DDR pad, which wouldn't necessarily apply to Guitar

1085
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:28,920
Hero, which is what it's under, or 689, which is a DJ Hero turntable, which doesn't really

1086
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:34,280
work with Guitar Hero 5 or Band Hero.

1087
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:40,880
Apparently they're just putting out patents for different things in C16.

1088
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:46,320
And this is, the group behind this is a patent compliance group.

1089
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:51,420
They're seeking, this is almost to the point where it's retarded, they're seeking $500

1090
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:54,280
for each Activision violation.

1091
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:59,280
$500, really.

1092
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:06,920
So but apparently they're also targeting other companies as well.

1093
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,040
Just Activision happens to be one of those.

1094
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:18,960
And according to Mark Mathenitis, the question is one that actually penalizes false marking

1095
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,800
that a product is patented or patent pending.

1096
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:26,560
The idea that those false markings might deter someone from trying to create something new

1097
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,400
in that area.

1098
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:35,120
So basically, hey look, we have a patent for a DDR controller, you can't make any dance

1099
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,120
games.

1100
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:38,120
It's like they're calling dibs on everything.

1101
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,760
Dibs on this, dibs on this, dibs on this, and then they don't do anything with it.

1102
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:44,280
And we're going to get into another story a little later on tonight about something

1103
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,720
that they're like, nope, nope, can't have it, it's ours.

1104
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:52,240
And they're not going to do anything with it.

1105
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:56,600
As much as a silly lawsuit as this sounds, I'm glad someone's calling them on it because

1106
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,580
now Activision is going to have to respond to this.

1107
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:01,840
Has Activision made a response to this?

1108
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:08,080
They haven't made a response yet, but at the same time, I don't see how they can, you know,

1109
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:11,880
patent a DDR pad when a DDR pad's already been made, you know what I mean?

1110
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,460
It's like, you can't patent something that already exists.

1111
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:17,960
You can't say, hey look, I invented the rock.

1112
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:21,640
Now you all owe me money because you have rocks.

1113
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:25,040
Well maybe they changed a couple of little things here.

1114
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,560
That's how it works.

1115
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:29,680
One law in this country is really weird, really weird.

1116
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:34,120
They change one or two things and claim it that they invented the genre, yeah.

1117
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,120
We know how that works.

1118
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,680
Yeah, right.

1119
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:39,640
So we'll see what comes forth of that.

1120
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:42,840
I'm really looking forward to what Activision has to say about that.

1121
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,760
Remember when Activision was like the best game company in the world because they made

1122
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:49,840
games like Pitfall and Kaboom and Keystone Capers?

1123
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,080
Then Bobby Kotick came along.

1124
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,880
His days are numbered, I'm telling you.

1125
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:57,680
His days are numbered because he looks, just lately in the past couple of years he's come

1126
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:04,320
out and looked like a buffoon and nobody likes, nobody likes their CEO to be a douche.

1127
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:07,320
Hey, how about something for free?

1128
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:08,320
Free games.

1129
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:11,460
Now this is the way to do business, Activision Take Notes.

1130
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:12,460
Free games.

1131
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,480
Actually I'll tell you even better than that, Dark Sakura.

1132
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,860
Free Pagle.

1133
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:16,860
That's right.

1134
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:17,860
Free Pagle.

1135
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:18,860
Crack.

1136
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:22,120
There is a promotion going on right now where you can get Pagle Knights for yourself or

1137
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:25,440
a loved one, family member, or even an enemy if you want, I don't care.

1138
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:31,280
All you have to do, you sign up for PopCap's newsletter by going to popcap.com.

1139
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:34,960
By the way, of course, that means they're going to spam your email with all the newsletters,

1140
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,260
but hey, I don't know about you, I have an email just set up for spam.

1141
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:41,000
So to sign up for different websites, bug me not.

1142
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,680
So yeah, there you go.

1143
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:47,400
There's also websites with disposable email addresses that'll last for about ten minutes,

1144
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:51,920
enough time for them to send you back your confirmation code and then poof, it's gone.

1145
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:52,920
Nice.

1146
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:57,240
I always liked the idea of setting up my own domain.

1147
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:01,280
I had a friend that did this, had his own domain that he set up for email addresses.

1148
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:05,480
And what he would do is when he would sign up for websites, he would create a new email

1149
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:12,760
account on his domain that was like, you know, whatever his name was, we'll say, uh, john.

1150
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:15,440
And then whatever the name of the site was that he was signing up for.

1151
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:19,040
So when all the spam emails started coming in, he would know exactly what site was doing

1152
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:22,960
it because he custom made email addresses for every website he signed up for.

1153
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:23,960
I think that's a great idea.

1154
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:28,520
Of course, I don't know if he posted those results anywhere, but he should.

1155
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:31,960
So I think I'd like to know what websites are selling my email address.

1156
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,040
I'll kick their butt.

1157
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:36,160
Question from our chat room.

1158
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:40,160
Uh, Kossin, and I apologize if I'm saying that wrong, but Kossin says, what's the disposable

1159
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,560
email site called?

1160
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:44,840
I don't remember, but I saw it in 2600 Magazine a while back.

1161
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:49,200
Apparently if there's a few of them, because gold anthro follows up with disposable.com

1162
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:54,080
and RoboKun says meltmail.com disposable, I think is the one I was thinking of.

1163
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,080
And Toa Gak just simply says there are lots of them.

1164
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:59,800
So there's a few of them out there wherever they can stick a banner ad.

1165
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,280
That's that's what they're going to do.

1166
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:04,960
All right, we're going to get into a segment here on the show that we love to do every

1167
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:05,960
week.

1168
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:09,280
It's the classic game of the week.

1169
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:13,040
And during the classic game of the week, we encourage dark soccer to dive into the vault

1170
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:18,640
of classic gaming and find a game that she says, you know what, kids and adults too,

1171
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:23,360
you should be playing this game this week because it's a it's a classic game.

1172
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:25,480
And if you're not playing this, you're a buffoon.

1173
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:26,480
Yeah.

1174
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:27,480
Dark soccer.

1175
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:28,480
But phone.

1176
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,540
So what should the non buffoons be playing this week?

1177
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:36,640
The game is venture from 1981 Wow, that's old.

1178
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:37,640
Yeah, that's older than most.

1179
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:40,520
I was five when this game came out.

1180
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:43,160
So since this is such an old game, there's not a lot of music.

1181
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:46,680
But let's play there's actually plenty of music in this one with some ambient noises

1182
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:47,680
and stuff.

1183
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:48,680
No, it's a lot of music.

1184
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:49,680
Listen.

1185
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:59,400
The one posted here is actually the clique of vision version specifically, because I

1186
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:03,040
played a crap ton of this on clique of vision.

1187
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:08,640
But the game is where you're this little guy named Winky who looks like kind of a sperm.

1188
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:15,040
I mean, kind of like a yeah, whatever he's this little blob with a bow and arrow.

1189
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:19,360
And he walks around this hall where these big things that I used to call them boogers

1190
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:23,580
when I when I was playing this as a kid.

1191
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:27,080
But they're just these tentacled hall monsters.

1192
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,080
You can't kill them.

1193
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:29,220
You can't stop them.

1194
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:32,360
They're just completely invulnerable.

1195
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:39,920
And with with that, you actually have to go into these four or five rooms per area and

1196
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:43,680
then get the treasure that's in each room while you're shooting and avoiding the little

1197
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:44,680
creatures inside.

1198
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:48,400
And each one has their own theme.

1199
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:53,960
If you touch one of the monsters, it's called you're getting carrioned.

1200
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:58,720
Which I thought, like, you hear that noise?

1201
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,640
That's when one of the when you've been hanging out in the room too long and the hall monster

1202
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:02,640
comes after you.

1203
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:03,640
I see.

1204
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:07,040
Or I guess now that I'm a little bit older, I can call it Cthulhu face.

1205
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:11,460
But you can you can do a little bit of dodging here and there.

1206
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:16,920
You can and the thing is that you can't run into the corpses of the things that you shoot

1207
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:19,380
or they'll kill you too.

1208
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:23,720
And they'll block your path until they fade from the screen.

1209
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,720
And you've got different types of dungeons.

1210
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:28,320
You cannot touch a corpse because they're smelly.

1211
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:30,400
You'll get carrioned.

1212
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:33,760
In level one you've got the wall room, the serpent room, the skeleton room, the goblin

1213
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:34,760
room.

1214
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:38,240
In level two you have the two-headed room, the dragon room, the spider room, the troll

1215
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,240
room.

1216
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:40,240
I can tell you the dragon room was pain in the ass.

1217
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:47,040
Level three you have the genie room, the demon room, the cyclops room, and the bat room.

1218
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:48,500
But I freaking love this game.

1219
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:52,020
This is kind of weird because I noticed that, like, you know, especially for being such

1220
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:57,240
an old game, like you have this screen that's like zoomed out showing all the different

1221
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:59,600
rooms and then you kind of like go into one room.

1222
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:00,600
That's the dragon room, by the way.

1223
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:01,600
That's interesting.

1224
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:02,600
Pain in the ass.

1225
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:11,480
But now this is one of those games, keep in mind, I had a clique-o-vision for a long time.

1226
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:16,360
Like I remember MTV coming out and me having a clique-o-vision.

1227
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:20,960
I remember those in a span of, you know, when I lived in the same house.

1228
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,440
I'll put it that way.

1229
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:30,320
And this was, my mother used to play a lot of this.

1230
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,880
Actually my mom's favorite game was Space Fury.

1231
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:32,880
Do you remember that?

1232
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,000
No, because I didn't have a clique-o-vision.

1233
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,600
Space Fury was kind of like an asteroids kind of game.

1234
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:43,200
And this is the type of stuff that I bet is coming to Microsoft's game room.

1235
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:47,080
When they talk about like a thousand classic games, you're going to see somebody digging

1236
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:50,880
into the back catalog of a lot of the old systems like clique-o-vision and Atari.

1237
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,480
I could probably make this in Flash now.

1238
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:56,840
I mean, seriously, I probably know enough Flash now to make this game.

1239
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,800
I'm sure there's clones out there.

1240
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:04,240
Oh yeah, but honestly it was, this was seriously one of my favorite games when I was a little

1241
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,240
kid.

1242
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:09,640
And I love the little dinky music, I'd go around humming this one to myself when I was

1243
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:10,640
a kid.

1244
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:16,320
But I mean, you know, the games that I had at the time, I had like Mouse Trap and Carnival.

1245
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:18,100
But this one got tons of play.

1246
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:21,800
This one and Turbo, but...

1247
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:22,800
Alright.

1248
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:26,980
And it actually had pretty good music for when it came out.

1249
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:29,120
For 81, yeah.

1250
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:32,400
So there you go, your classic video game of the week, Venture.

1251
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:36,520
It was an arcade game too, but I guess Dark Psycho is really referencing the clique-o-vision

1252
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,520
one.

1253
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,520
Was the arcade version really different?

1254
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:40,640
No, not really.

1255
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:46,560
The clique-o-version, clique-o-vision, clique-o-vision one I think came out in 82?

1256
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:47,720
Here's some from the arcade version.

1257
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:50,680
I just noticed this related little video here, I just kind of want to take a peek and see

1258
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:51,680
how it's different.

1259
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:55,720
Oh yeah, it's very similar looking, like almost like it's done on the same hardware or something.

1260
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:58,080
Except, you know, there's a little bit more animation.

1261
01:07:58,080 --> 01:07:59,080
Yeah.

1262
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:03,880
Oh yeah, when you go in the rooms, it like zooms in.

1263
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:04,880
Interesting.

1264
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:08,360
But it had the same gameplay.

1265
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:09,360
Yeah.

1266
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,360
That's kind of interesting.

1267
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:12,360
Oops, sorry.

1268
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:13,360
Alright.

1269
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:17,480
But honestly, for me, it was all about, I mean, you know, the rooms are all the same.

1270
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:22,920
It's just, they zoom in and out, you know, but this was totally like my game.

1271
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:23,920
Alright.

1272
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:27,000
Venturi, oh this one has the corpses kind of rotting away.

1273
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Yeah.

1274
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,440
I mean, like I said, a little bit more animation, you know, but, oh and the snot monsters were

1275
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:33,440
red.

1276
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:36,360
But still, it's the same game.

1277
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:42,000
The clique-o-vision version is probably, for its time, the best translation of that game

1278
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
that there was.

1279
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Which came first?

1280
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Venture or adventure?

1281
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Because...

1282
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
I think venture came first.

1283
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Did it really?

1284
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,720
I just, you know, my timeline from back then is not that great.

1285
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:51,720
Let me check.

1286
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:52,720
Let me check.

1287
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:54,880
Yeah, look that up real quick, because I'm curious.

1288
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:58,640
Because there are some similarities of sorts between the two, and I've seen comparisons

1289
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,800
to Berserk as well, because...

1290
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:05,520
Yeah, it actually, the hall monsters are actually sort of like the evil Otto from Berserk.

1291
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:08,600
Which is the bouncing happy face, if anyone's actually played that.

1292
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:10,600
Good stuff.

1293
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:13,040
Um, I can't find adventure.

1294
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,040
Oh well.

1295
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:17,440
Oh no, maybe actually spelling it right would be nice?

1296
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:20,000
That would help in trying to do your research.

1297
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Absolutely.

1298
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Yeah.

1299
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Okay.

1300
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:30,120
No, adventure was, uh, well there was a Sierra one in 1979.

1301
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:31,120
So yeah.

1302
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:32,120
Hmm.

1303
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:33,760
There's different games that were named adventure.

1304
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:34,760
So.

1305
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:35,760
Interesting.

1306
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:39,800
Alright, well we're gonna take a quick break here at Orange Lounge Radio, but fear not,

1307
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:42,080
we'll be back with more in tonight's Part B.

1308
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,960
So stick around folks.

1309
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:49,360
We'll be right back in just a minute with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1310
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:53,160
And for those of you guys listening live tonight, we're gonna take a quick music break here

1311
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:56,640
in studio, and then we'll come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1312
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:01,120
We're just gonna do some potpourri here of some various, I think we'll do some Bamani

1313
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,120
songs tonight.

1314
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:03,120
Why not?

1315
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,440
We'll be right back in just a moment here live at All Games Radio with Part B of Orange

1316
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:07,440
Lounge Radio.

1317
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:10,360
This is a chance for you to get up and stretch and all that good stuff.

1318
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:16,720
We'll see you in a minute.

1319
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:21,320
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, February the 28th

1320
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:22,320
of 2010.

1321
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,920
So it's not a leap year, so it is the last day of February.

1322
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:27,120
It's gonna be March all over again tomorrow.

1323
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,440
Can't believe how fast the year is moving.

1324
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:30,440
Yikes.

1325
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:31,640
We're all getting old really quick.

1326
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:35,840
Speaking of which, the song that we just played during break, now unfortunately the podcast

1327
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:39,200
listeners can't hear it because you know the songs that we play during the break are copyrighted

1328
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:44,960
so we can only do it during the live streaming, but we played a remix by Mr. T, not the I

1329
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:49,880
Pity the Foo kind from the A-Team, but Mr. T that did Bamani remixes back in the day

1330
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:52,280
from Popin' Music 10.

1331
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:58,440
He did a remix of Goonies Are Good Enough from Goonies 2, which was also in the movie,

1332
01:10:58,440 --> 01:10:59,440
the Cyndi Lauper song.

1333
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:04,200
Now I can play a clip, so let me play a quick little clip for the benefit of the podcast

1334
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:14,560
listeners.

1335
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:15,560
It's good enough.

1336
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:16,560
Okay, yeah, right.

1337
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:21,640
So I just was, and it was making me think that, God, I loved Goonies 2, the video game on

1338
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:22,640
the NES.

1339
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:26,360
It was so like kind of like ahead of his time in some ways, but I was firing that up on

1340
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:29,960
the FC Mobile not that long ago because I actually have the cartridge of it and good

1341
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:30,960
memories.

1342
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,120
That was such a great game.

1343
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:35,820
Even though it really had nothing to do with the Goonies movie, it was still amazing.

1344
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:36,820
So F the Haters.

1345
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:37,820
There you go.

1346
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:42,520
Before we get into Twitter topics and some more gaming news tonight, I wanted to talk

1347
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:44,720
really quickly about something I watched this week.

1348
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:48,920
And I don't know if you guys, I don't know if Loki or Dark Soccer has familiarized themselves

1349
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:49,920
with this at all, but...

1350
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,760
I know what it is, and therefore I avoided this.

1351
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:52,960
Okay, well here it is, here it is.

1352
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:58,680
On the PlayStation Network this week, or I should say last week, they released The Tester,

1353
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:03,240
which is kind of a PlayStation Network exclusive show.

1354
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:07,120
It's kind of like an experimental thing because this is television essentially that was made

1355
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,020
for the PlayStation Network.

1356
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:14,720
So it's a reality show, and I know we've reported on this on the show before, so I think most

1357
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:18,320
of our listeners are already aware, it's this reality show where the prize is to become

1358
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:21,440
a game tester for Sony Computer Entertainment.

1359
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:22,440
That is the prize.

1360
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:23,440
Sony Prize.

1361
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:28,760
But one thing they also don't say very well, also a $5,000 signing bonus.

1362
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:31,320
So there is a cash prize that goes with it as well.

1363
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:33,960
So there is at least just that.

1364
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:36,320
You'll need it to offset the wages.

1365
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:38,480
Well, I checked out the show.

1366
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:44,880
Now if you guys don't already know, I am unapologetically a fan of reality game shows.

1367
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:49,800
I don't necessarily mean all reality TV, but I loved Survivor back in the day.

1368
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:53,360
I wanted to apply for Survivor actually way back in the day, but I didn't have a passport

1369
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:54,840
or something, so I didn't do it.

1370
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:58,020
But I remember when they were casting for the first season of Survivor.

1371
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:00,760
But I just love old game shows, and I like the whole idea of a reality game show.

1372
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:01,760
I watched Big Brother.

1373
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:04,360
I've done fan games online.

1374
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:08,360
I even like Project Runway, and my new favorite reality game show is RuPaul's Drag Race.

1375
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:11,060
It's the most amazing show on television right now.

1376
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:15,040
What I don't like when they talk about reality shows, I don't like The Housewives of Orange

1377
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,040
County.

1378
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,440
I don't like The Hills.

1379
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,520
And so I agree there's a lot of crap out there.

1380
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:23,000
I kind of hate it when people say, I hate reality shows.

1381
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Reality game shows.

1382
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,340
Because that's like saying, I hate dramas, or I hate comedies.

1383
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:30,760
There's a lot of different types of reality shows, and some of them are very good.

1384
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:34,520
But of course, obviously, hearing about The Tester, I'm a little bit apprehensive about

1385
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:36,760
this, but I'm like, okay, I'm a fan of reality shows.

1386
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:38,040
I'm a fan of video games.

1387
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:40,760
I need to check this show out and give it a fair shot.

1388
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,280
So I downloaded the show.

1389
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:44,140
It's about a 22-minute show.

1390
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:47,360
It's suitable for a 30-minute broadcast, basically with commercial breaks.

1391
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:53,180
And I watched it, and it's not that bad.

1392
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:54,880
Are you surprised to hear me say that?

1393
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:55,880
Nope.

1394
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:56,880
No.

1395
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,700
It's not terrible.

1396
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:01,720
It's a ridiculous concept.

1397
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:05,600
I mean, I'm not going to get past the fact that we all know, if you've kind of had a

1398
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:10,600
friend that works in the gaming industry, we all know the prize at the end of the day

1399
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:11,600
is ridiculous.

1400
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,120
But at least they throw a $5,000 signing bonus into it.

1401
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:16,560
So at least there's that.

1402
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:20,220
But I'm thinking to myself as I'm watching this, you know, this is basically a television

1403
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:22,000
show I'm watching on my PlayStation.

1404
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:27,080
The quality is great because it's in HDTV, and you can download it in HD, and it looks

1405
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:32,360
better than most HD Comcast shows because I think most television comes out only at

1406
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:35,280
like 720, but this was like 1080 or whatever.

1407
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:40,860
So the look of it was really good, and it was put together okay.

1408
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:43,920
The editing, you know, the editing was really tight because it's only a 22-minute show,

1409
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:46,800
so you don't really get a lot of time to know the people.

1410
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:49,220
But the editing was competent.

1411
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:52,760
The show was put together well enough.

1412
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:58,760
The biggest flaw about the show is that, again, the contest is so ridiculous to begin with

1413
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:05,040
that basically the whole elimination and everything that they did was over this one minor challenge

1414
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:10,440
that they did that the judges, who were two guys that worked for Sony and Hal Sparks,

1415
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:15,160
which I don't know why Hal Sparks is a judge and not the host, but whatever.

1416
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:20,040
I realize they need to have some type of celebrity draw, and, you know, I actually like Hal Sparks.

1417
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:25,000
I think he's great on The Soup back in the day when he was doing that stuff, and then

1418
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,840
I Love the 90s and all those shows.

1419
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:30,660
I think he's funny, and of course queer as folk, you know.

1420
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:35,600
So I think he's a good talent to have on there, although, you know, as a judge, eh, I think

1421
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:39,040
he would have been a better host because they have some no-name girl doing the hosting,

1422
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:43,440
you know, she's, what, a generic reality show host, whatever.

1423
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:47,880
So I guess my biggest complaint is that the competition itself is a little weird.

1424
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:51,960
Like I kind of wish they had, like most reality game shows run an hour, even RuPaul's Drag

1425
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:56,560
Race is an hour, so that there is like a mini challenge, a mega challenge, and some time

1426
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,400
to understand what's going on.

1427
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:01,020
But I felt like the biggest flaw with the show is that it was just like, it was done

1428
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:06,440
so fast that you really didn't get a feel for why maybe one of them left.

1429
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:10,440
I'll just spoil the first episode for you guys, two people leave in the first episode,

1430
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:14,280
one of them you kind of see coming because they're very strange and awkward, but the

1431
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:19,160
other one you're kind of like, I didn't really know anything about this person, so I can't

1432
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:21,840
feel bad that they got kicked off the show.

1433
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:24,520
But here's the other thing I want to say about this, because I know a lot of people are saying

1434
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:27,720
like, what the hell, Rob, you actually like the show?

1435
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:30,880
I don't know if I'd go so far as to say like, I like it, I'm going to set a season pass

1436
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:31,880
on my TiVo.

1437
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:37,800
I just think it was a competent show and quite honestly, it's better than about 90% of what's

1438
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:38,800
on G4 television.

1439
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:43,000
Here's my problem, the way I looked at it is when I heard that they're doing a reality

1440
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:48,000
show where people are going to get to play games and stuff like that, that are first

1441
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,320
looks at certain games, I saw that as, hey look, it's a 22 minute long commercial for

1442
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,880
Sony games, no thanks.

1443
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,220
It wasn't that bad, it wasn't that in your face.

1444
01:16:57,220 --> 01:17:02,520
They live in this bachelor pattish thing that is all these video games and you know of course

1445
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:07,240
the guys like, sweet, Uncharted 2, some of that was a little ridiculous, but that's no

1446
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:10,180
worse than the judges drinking Coke at the American Idol's table.

1447
01:17:10,180 --> 01:17:13,120
You expect there's going to be some of that product placement, but the challenge had nothing

1448
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:14,640
to do with the Sony game at all.

1449
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,960
And I thought actually the challenge that they played in this first episode, which was

1450
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:22,820
basically a glamorized version of can you spot the differences between the two pictures,

1451
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:28,640
I thought it actually played into the whole what you have to do to be a tester thing relatively

1452
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:29,640
well.

1453
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:30,640
What's that, Jamie?

1454
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:31,640
Nothing.

1455
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:32,640
I was talking about Shermie.

1456
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:33,640
Oh.

1457
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:34,640
Shermie just crapped.

1458
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:35,640
Oh, did she?

1459
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:37,640
That was her review of the show.

1460
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:39,200
Nice.

1461
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:42,020
But yeah, I mean they played it up okay.

1462
01:17:42,020 --> 01:17:43,840
I mean I was expecting a lot worse.

1463
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:49,140
The bar was very low, but I got a show that I would watch if I was flipping through TVs

1464
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:52,980
with nothing to watch and I stop on G4 TV and the show's on.

1465
01:17:52,980 --> 01:17:55,880
It's better than most of the crap on that network right now.

1466
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:59,280
That still just doesn't sound like enough to make me actually put any effort into watching

1467
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,280
TV.

1468
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:02,760
But yeah, you don't, I wouldn't recommend the show for you, Jamie, I don't think you'd

1469
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:03,760
like it.

1470
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:12,480
Well, you know, I watch three shows with any variety of regularity, Supernatural, Doctor

1471
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:17,800
Who, and let me get back to it.

1472
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:18,800
Oh, BBC News.

1473
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:19,800
Oh, okay.

1474
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:20,800
You know what?

1475
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:21,800
What?

1476
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:24,780
I was gonna say though, Jamie, I would recommend, however, you watch RuPaul's Drag Race because

1477
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:25,960
it's amazing.

1478
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:27,280
And may the best woman win.

1479
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,640
I love drag queens so much.

1480
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,960
You know what would be so awesome?

1481
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:31,960
Me too.

1482
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:32,960
What?

1483
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:33,960
On Xbox Live.

1484
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:34,960
Huh.

1485
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:38,720
Now that they're gonna have the Microsoft Game Room thing.

1486
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:39,720
Yeah.

1487
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:41,400
To bring back Starrcade.

1488
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:42,400
Seriously.

1489
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:47,180
But, you know, you gotta think though, this is, sure this show is a little eh, but it

1490
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:50,960
could be setting the stage for something even greater in the future.

1491
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:55,940
Like, you know, it's kind of interesting that, wow, Sony put all this together, who else

1492
01:18:55,940 --> 01:19:00,560
might deliver their show exclusively on PlayStation Network or Xbox Live Arcade?

1493
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,720
And yeah, I'm all for Starrcade coming back.

1494
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:04,400
Or some type of old school game show.

1495
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:08,760
Like, you know, like 1 vs 100, but Starrcade, where you play the games that they're playing

1496
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:10,880
during the show and stuff like that.

1497
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,300
That is a great idea.

1498
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:13,300
I would love to see that.

1499
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:16,080
To answer Tigerclaw, I wasn't impressed enough with the first episode of V to give it any

1500
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,940
more thought.

1501
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:21,280
And for the listeners that don't know what Darkstar is talking about, Tigerclaw said,

1502
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,280
V next month.

1503
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:25,280
You gotta watch V. So there you go.

1504
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:29,520
Oh, Shermie took a duty in the hallway.

1505
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:33,000
That's no good.

1506
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:40,600
And that's what she thinks of the tester.

1507
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:45,840
A shit with no effort.

1508
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:49,920
I can't believe the cat just took a dump on the floor in the middle of the show.

1509
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:55,640
Dump where dump should not be on the PlayStation Network.

1510
01:19:55,640 --> 01:20:01,760
Which cat, when forced to watch the tester, takes a crap first?

1511
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:10,000
No, to explain, Shermie is an old lady.

1512
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,000
She's up there now in cat ears and is not in...

1513
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,920
So she just didn't make it to the litter box or what?

1514
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:16,920
I have no idea.

1515
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:17,920
I'm trying to figure out what's wrong.

1516
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,960
I'm going to take her to the vet probably after payday.

1517
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:20,960
I hope she's okay.

1518
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:23,240
Yeah, she's just been...

1519
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:24,240
And anytime she...

1520
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:25,960
Well, no, I just...

1521
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:29,120
Maybe she doesn't like her litter because she does that when she doesn't like her litter

1522
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:30,120
either.

1523
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:32,000
Even though it's the same litter I've been using for a while.

1524
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
I think it was just a response.

1525
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,280
Well, props to her at least going towards the bathroom.

1526
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:36,280
I know.

1527
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:37,960
At least she didn't do it on the mixing board.

1528
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:39,500
No, no, no.

1529
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:41,880
She will do it either.

1530
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:46,000
When she decides to poop somewhere that is not her box, she will either do it on one

1531
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,840
of the bathroom rugs right in front of the bathroom or on one of the kitchen rugs.

1532
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:54,800
She does not do it so much on one of the kitchen rugs because I yelled at her.

1533
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,920
She at least does it where it can be easily cleaned up.

1534
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,320
I think she's making a statement.

1535
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:03,840
I think she's like, mom, you should quit your job and pay attention to me 24 seven.

1536
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:04,840
She cats it all the time.

1537
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:09,440
All right, let's stop talking about poop and talk about game news.

1538
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:13,880
She says the show is good for me to poop on.

1539
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:15,200
Clearly.

1540
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:17,520
How about some rapid fire news, Loki?

1541
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:18,520
All right.

1542
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:21,120
Well, um, there's actually this is real quick.

1543
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,120
Sorry.

1544
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:23,120
Get your tweets in.

1545
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:26,800
I don't think I mentioned it before in the show, but if you have some tweets for tonight's

1546
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:30,360
Twitter topics, get those in now, now, now, um, this is kind of interesting.

1547
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:36,280
Super Meat Boy is coming to Xbox Live Arcade and actually before the WiiWare version, which,

1548
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:39,520
you know, I didn't even realize there was an Xbox Live Arcade version, and now it's

1549
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:43,600
coming out before it is scheduled to be coming out this summer.

1550
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:44,760
And that's pretty cool.

1551
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:49,120
And for those who don't know, Super Meat Boy is a platform action game starring a little

1552
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:53,760
character that's made out of meat and you splatter around the screen and that's all

1553
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:55,760
fun.

1554
01:21:55,760 --> 01:22:01,800
Then, of course, there's going to be a tie in game with the new movie Kick Ass that is

1555
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:05,400
coming to PlayStation three and the iPhone.

1556
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:11,240
And of course, this game kind of reminds me a little bit of the Watchmen The End is Nigh,

1557
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:16,320
which I think did a little bit better on the PS3, probably because the Blu-ray was bundled

1558
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:19,000
with the game when it came out retail.

1559
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:25,160
But the PS3 game will have Facebook integration as well.

1560
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:28,480
And I don't know.

1561
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,640
Game looks just OK.

1562
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:34,800
It looks just like a beat-em-up action game, just like the Watchmen one.

1563
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:39,760
The movie, though, on the other hand, is pretty awesome and it's kind of, you know, what happens

1564
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:43,640
when kids decide to become superheroes, but they don't have superpowers.

1565
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:46,000
They just fight crime.

1566
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,760
It's got Nicolas Cage acting weird.

1567
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:54,560
And then on the PlayStation Network, the version of Castle Crashers is getting a brand new

1568
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,320
addition.

1569
01:22:56,320 --> 01:23:03,000
Extreme Volleyball Action is coming to the PlayStation three version of Castle Crashers.

1570
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:10,160
Apparently they're including a cooperative and competitive volleyball game with online

1571
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:16,320
or offline play, and Magic Attacks apparently will be directly applied to your ball as well

1572
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:22,720
as there's going to be some leaderboards, spiking moves, and some other stuff.

1573
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:26,720
And this is coming from the Behemoth development blog.

1574
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:32,320
Sorry, Jamie's having the great Lysol race in the hallway right now.

1575
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:34,200
It's a good thing I can't smell anything.

1576
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:35,880
Oh, that's right, you're congesting.

1577
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:36,880
I can't smell a thing.

1578
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:37,880
I was just being polite.

1579
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:40,160
I didn't want to sit here and go, Jamie, your house smells like poop.

1580
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:44,320
Well, no, I just smelled it because fucking Shermie.

1581
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:45,760
She just needs, she just needs a...

1582
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:50,920
I was like, I don't know, maybe all this talk about the tester made Jamie crap her pants.

1583
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:51,920
I don't know.

1584
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:52,920
I don't want to be rude.

1585
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:53,920
No.

1586
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,760
It's Shermie shit in the hall.

1587
01:23:55,760 --> 01:24:00,520
At least go in the tub.

1588
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:03,480
I was, that was a reference to last week's show, you see what I did there?

1589
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:04,480
All right.

1590
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,480
Sorry, Loki.

1591
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:07,160
Do you have anything else you want to share?

1592
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:08,160
That's it.

1593
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:09,160
All right.

1594
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:10,160
I got some quick stories for you guys.

1595
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:11,560
Actually, I did check out this game.

1596
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:14,520
I didn't mention it during my gaming week, but this is something I did check out this

1597
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:16,120
week and that was Missile Command.

1598
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:19,440
It's a brand new version of Missile Command from Atari.

1599
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:22,360
It's free to play and it's on the web and it's like a co-op.

1600
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:25,560
It's actually a multiplayer thing by developer OMG Pop.

1601
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:30,000
That doesn't sound like another developer I know that does a lot of casual web games

1602
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,360
at all, but yeah, it's a whole like new souped up version of Missile Command and it's, it

1603
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:35,360
was okay.

1604
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:36,360
It was cute.

1605
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:37,360
It was fun.

1606
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:41,480
It wasn't really that much like the original to me, but no word yet if Mr. Awesome is on

1607
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:46,680
and playing or what's going on, but you can check that out at Atari.com slash Missile

1608
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:47,680
Command.

1609
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:48,680
It's free.

1610
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:49,680
Can't complain about free.

1611
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:54,000
Well, I had no idea that they were trying to do this game, but apparently they are.

1612
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,800
They're making a game out of Grease.

1613
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:58,940
Yes, the play Grease.

1614
01:24:58,940 --> 01:25:02,040
You know, tell me more.

1615
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:03,040
Tell me more.

1616
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:04,040
Yes.

1617
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:07,860
Uh, apparently, uh, yeah, they're making a video game version of this five Oh five games

1618
01:25:07,860 --> 01:25:09,440
actually is the people that were making it.

1619
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:10,440
I'm not surprised.

1620
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:16,640
They have actually found, uh, a, I guess a, a publisher for it or five Oh five games is

1621
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:17,640
the publisher.

1622
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:18,640
I think I'm sorry.

1623
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:21,320
Yeah, they are the publisher who's, who's developing a big head games.

1624
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:27,480
Uh, they did chime on the Xbox live that was a recent, no word as to like what the game

1625
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:28,920
is at all.

1626
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:30,760
How would you make a game out of Grease?

1627
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:33,140
Like a karaoke game or it's going to be awful.

1628
01:25:33,140 --> 01:25:35,520
It's just like, Hey look, we bought the rights to something.

1629
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:36,520
Yay.

1630
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:37,520
Let's make a game out of it.

1631
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:44,120
You know, not them, but like other companies, you know, they'll buy rights for like stupid

1632
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:45,120
shit.

1633
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:48,840
Like the smile, you know, like the smiley face shirts, smiley.

1634
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:49,840
Yeah.

1635
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:51,920
There is a company that bought the rights for that made a game out of it.

1636
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:53,600
No one remembers it because it sucked.

1637
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:58,320
I remember a face ball 2000 that had the big smiley's have a nice day.

1638
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,320
Exactly.

1639
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:01,040
But that game was actually kind of fun.

1640
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:08,360
Um, or for example, um, the jelly belly, they have like a jelly belly game cause they licensed

1641
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:12,320
that cause the license was really cheap or yummy or M and M's.

1642
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:15,080
They made some M and M game racing game.

1643
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:16,080
That was pretty terrible.

1644
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:17,080
Huh?

1645
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:18,080
Well, yeah.

1646
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:21,600
Yo, no, it was cool, but that was like way back in the eighties when people knew what

1647
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:26,080
the hell the noise kids and annoyed supposed to be making a comeback.

1648
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:29,560
It was supposed to be, look, how about a computer game?

1649
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:30,560
Everybody wants to play.

1650
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:32,720
There's tons and tons of people want to play this star craft too.

1651
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:34,680
And of course the beta is going on right now.

1652
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:39,200
Uh, apparently due to the number of Blizzcon attendees, not everybody who is at Blizzcon

1653
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:44,200
is yet in the beta, but in the next couple of weeks after this first wave, uh, supposedly

1654
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:47,440
all the Blizzcon attendees are going to be included in a future wave.

1655
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:49,560
It's supposed to be happening in the next couple of weeks.

1656
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:52,640
So it might be as soon as the time you guys actually hear this podcast.

1657
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,120
So you might want to follow up on that.

1658
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:57,880
If you were a Blizzcon attendee, you could be playing a star craft too right now, or

1659
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:59,000
very soon at least.

1660
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,360
Dark Sakura.

1661
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:03,200
Well, um, this is pretty happy stuff.

1662
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:08,600
Um, there are, uh, for a pre-order bonus for super street fighter four, there's a classic

1663
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,480
costume pack.

1664
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:15,080
And so, um, they are for Blanca, Guile, Gen, Feilong and Dalsim.

1665
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:22,280
Um, for Feilong he gets a kind of a, uh, Kato costume.

1666
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:23,280
And Blanca- I love Feilong.

1667
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:24,280
Just saying.

1668
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:26,440
Blanca gets Dan's Gui.

1669
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:32,160
Which if you, uh, and this goes back to actually, um, Street Fighter Alpha 3, did you ever beat

1670
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:33,160
Street Fighter Alpha 3?

1671
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:35,400
I don't think I ever played Street Fighter Alpha 3.

1672
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:38,880
It was kind of during that period when I wasn't playing a lot of games heavy.

1673
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:42,320
One of the endings, Dan and Blanca are just hanging out.

1674
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:45,560
And Blanca can- no, Dan can understand all of Blanca's grunts.

1675
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:49,920
So he's like, I see you, my friend, let's go out and play.

1676
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:50,920
Rolling and rolling.

1677
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:52,840
And it has the two of them rolling across the screen, that's where I get the rolling

1678
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:53,840
and rolling from.

1679
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:56,400
So yeah, he's wearing a Dansky.

1680
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:59,160
Um, then- Are they like gay lovers or something?

1681
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:00,160
Or is it just- I don't think so.

1682
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:01,160
Okay.

1683
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:02,160
They're just BFFs.

1684
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:03,160
They're BFFs.

1685
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:04,560
It's Jay and Silent Bob.

1686
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:08,640
Um, and then Gen has a- Heterosexual life partners.

1687
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:09,640
Yeah.

1688
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:10,640
Gen is shirtless.

1689
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:14,240
Um, Guile is wearing a ballistic vest.

1690
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:18,760
He's just all kinds of, you know, hardcore ops guy.

1691
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:28,720
And Dhalsim is wearing, um, a, uh, I guess just more traditional, um, dress for India.

1692
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:30,720
There you go.

1693
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:31,720
Very snazzy.

1694
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:38,680
He looks like- Who is that fighter in, um, um, Mike Tyson's Punch Out where the little

1695
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:43,120
ruby in his turban would flash, and that's how you knew he was about to throw a punch.

1696
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:45,240
What was that guy's name in Mike Tyson's Punch Out?

1697
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:47,480
I don't remember, but this totally- Because that's what Dhalsim looks like right

1698
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:48,480
there.

1699
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:49,480
I'm gonna link the picture in the chat room.

1700
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:50,480
All right.

1701
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:52,000
Somebody, somebody in chat will, uh, yell it out there.

1702
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Ah, it's Tiger something.

1703
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
I don't remember.

1704
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Yeah.

1705
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:00,600
Uh, Shaoran in chat, by the way, says bromance would be the term for, uh, what Dan and Blanca

1706
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:02,120
have going on there.

1707
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:07,000
And Dark Tetsuya says, now I have an image of Dan saying snooch to the nooch.

1708
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:12,600
You know, there's actually, um, it's funny that the term bromance, there actually is,

1709
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:15,200
um, a term called romantic friendship.

1710
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:16,600
Have you ever heard of that?

1711
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:18,280
I think I have, yeah.

1712
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:19,920
And I thought that was funny.

1713
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:23,160
Uh, Dark Tetsuya says Great Tiger was the name of that fighter.

1714
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:24,160
Sounds right.

1715
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:26,340
I think he's right.

1716
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:29,240
That's why I love having a live audience, because when I don't know the answer to something,

1717
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:31,000
I'll just go chat, help, and they do.

1718
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,000
It's great.

1719
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:37,480
And Akdefta is wondering if they're starting a bad bromance, rah, rah.

1720
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:38,480
You know what?

1721
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:46,720
I freaking have to listen to that song now after, you know, me really loathing Lady whatever,

1722
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:49,000
because you cannot resist the power of Lady Gaga.

1723
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
She's she's amazing.

1724
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,120
I don't really like any of her other stuff, by the way.

1725
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:53,120
It's just that one.

1726
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:54,360
I actually kind of like, okay.

1727
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:55,360
Nobody's perfect.

1728
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:56,360
You'll come around.

1729
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:57,360
I know.

1730
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:58,360
I know.

1731
01:29:58,360 --> 01:29:59,360
She'll eventually become perfect like me.

1732
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:06,320
Okay, topic time, www.Twitter.com slash O L R. Show us your tweets every week and we'll

1733
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:08,520
read some of our favorites here on the program.

1734
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:12,340
Of course, we can't read everything, but there's some really good questions tonight, so I want

1735
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:13,340
to get to this.

1736
01:30:13,340 --> 01:30:15,120
Um, let's see.

1737
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:17,800
Nut Man wants to know if the podcast will be uploaded tomorrow.

1738
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:18,800
Pretty please.

1739
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:19,800
It should be.

1740
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:22,680
Uh, there shouldn't be a delay at all this week, although I got to say I had last week's

1741
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:26,360
show up Monday night, but I should, I've been getting pretty good this year about getting

1742
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:27,980
the show up within 24 hours.

1743
01:30:27,980 --> 01:30:29,900
So I'm going to try and continue that trend.

1744
01:30:29,900 --> 01:30:35,060
Knock on wood, um, at depth links us to a story that harmonics might not actually be

1745
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:37,220
working on rock band three right now.

1746
01:30:37,220 --> 01:30:39,680
There may actually be something else going on right now.

1747
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:44,960
Um, I guess, uh, this is a new story he's linked us to from rock band aid.com.

1748
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:48,740
Uh, I guess, let's see what's going on here.

1749
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:52,180
There's a Twitter from some guy, I guess, at harmonics harmonics.

1750
01:30:52,180 --> 01:30:55,760
The creators of the rock band video game is planning on using one of my tracks for their

1751
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:56,760
demo projects.

1752
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:57,760
Awesome.

1753
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:03,040
This is some, uh, other guy and I guess harmonics recently licensed hip hop and dance songs

1754
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,880
kind of putting it all together.

1755
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:09,440
And so now maybe there might be a new frequency or amplitude game is kind of the rumor that's

1756
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:11,860
going on right now, which would make a lot of sense.

1757
01:31:11,860 --> 01:31:14,400
You know, frequency and amplitude kind of came out when not a lot of people knew who

1758
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:18,000
harmonics was and they were more experimental games, but they were great games.

1759
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,760
And I think if they are going to, you know, now that more people know what rock band is,

1760
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:25,880
if they're going to kind of come out with a, I don't know what would they call a game

1761
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:32,120
around dance music and stuff that's in that frequency, amplitude, vein, I don't know frequency

1762
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:37,000
frequency to freak, who knows, Apple and CJ hero.

1763
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,560
Oh wait, no, we'll see.

1764
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:43,480
Uh, Salvex seven sends us a variety of tweets here on one subject.

1765
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:44,480
Let me read these.

1766
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:47,000
It's a little longer than 140, 40 characters, but it's okay.

1767
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Does it like the question here?

1768
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,240
Salvex seven on Twitter.

1769
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:54,080
Hey guys, I have an interesting question for you historically, which generation of gaming

1770
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:58,160
would you classify as the most contra country that got cut off?

1771
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:03,760
I'm assuming contributive to society's development regarding to the social interaction, the fun

1772
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:07,140
element escape from one's reality and moral values.

1773
01:32:07,140 --> 01:32:10,560
I know it's complex, but if you could answer it, I would appreciate it.

1774
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:11,560
Take care guys.

1775
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:12,560
Have a nice one.

1776
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:13,600
What do you guys think?

1777
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:22,000
What generation of gaming would classify as the most contributive to society's development?

1778
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,000
That's a tough question.

1779
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:28,960
What just the development of society as in, and he goes on to specify as in, uh, the social

1780
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:34,640
interaction, the fun element, the escape from one's reality and moral, moral values, pong

1781
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:36,000
haul the way back to old school.

1782
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Where would we be?

1783
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:40,400
I mean, where would the industry be if someone didn't invent pong, the zeroth generation?

1784
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:44,520
Yeah, I'd say like the arcade age or something like that.

1785
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:50,520
Maybe even like just the, not necessarily the eight bit generation, but like, um, you

1786
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:55,800
know, even before that probably the four bit generation, you know, the Tari, Coleco, Odyssey,

1787
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:56,800
that kind of stuff.

1788
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:00,160
Well, I think in gaming it'd be the day that we got on the radio.

1789
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:01,160
Nice answer.

1790
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:02,720
Uh, I would have two answers for this question.

1791
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:05,640
I would say, I think it's the fourth generation of gaming.

1792
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:08,940
The one that involved the NES, the, when the Nintendo entertainment system first came to

1793
01:33:08,940 --> 01:33:13,660
America because it came out at a time when video games were pretty much declared dead

1794
01:33:13,660 --> 01:33:16,720
and dying and nobody is interested in video games anymore.

1795
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:21,280
You know, after the great video game crash of 84, 83, whatever you want to pay it as.

1796
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:25,040
And then, um, the NES comes out and the NES does very well.

1797
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:30,720
And who in the, in our generation, you know, where our lower thirties, upper twenties,

1798
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:34,760
who in our generation does not know super Mario brothers or link from Zelda.

1799
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:39,680
Like who in this generation does not know that from your country, even people that don't

1800
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:43,880
do nerdy gaming podcasts every week or listen to them, they know who Mario and Luigi are.

1801
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:45,120
You know, those characters.

1802
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:48,480
I think it was really the first generation to create a character.

1803
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:53,480
I don't think everybody on the street knows who Pitfall Harry, or maybe some of the, well,

1804
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:54,480
maybe Pac-Man.

1805
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:57,880
I mean, that came from the generation before, but I think, I don't know, something about

1806
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:01,760
really bringing it into the homes and so forth with these really memorable characters.

1807
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:07,240
I think that was really the generation that did have a song written about him and Mario

1808
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:10,040
really didn't other than do the Mario.

1809
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:14,360
Um, but then the, my other answer to the question would be the current one.

1810
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:18,240
The current generation of gaming, I think is huge to society because for a variety of

1811
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:24,160
reasons, a, the, we has, you know, as much as we love to hate on it for, you know, what

1812
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:28,280
it is sometimes here on this show, there's no denying that it has penetrated society

1813
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:30,720
in a way that most video game systems have not.

1814
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:36,280
We sports is like such a typical video game.

1815
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:38,400
It's like not even like a video game to a lot of people.

1816
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:44,280
We sports is a, it's a, it's like, you know, it's an activity simulation.

1817
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:46,800
People don't say, let's come over and play video games and say, let's come over and play

1818
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:50,120
we sports or, you know, the, we, you know, it's, it's just so interesting.

1819
01:34:50,120 --> 01:34:55,200
And then on the other hand, you have Xbox live, you know, really kind of in a way almost

1820
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:58,800
killing arcades because people are able to communicate over the internet and talk while

1821
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:01,800
they're playing games and develop this whole community.

1822
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:05,840
And then, you know, some, somewhat the PlayStation three in this as well, but then now that video

1823
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:08,640
games are not just about video games, but they're entertainment boxes.

1824
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:13,960
There are these, you know, sets in our living room that do everything that now that they're,

1825
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:16,120
that they're getting their own TV shows for heaven's sakes.

1826
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:20,400
I mean, I think this current one is, is shaping things up in, in a huge way.

1827
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:21,400
That's going to continue.

1828
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:25,320
Certainly it's, they're setting it up to have a longer lifespan than the generations before

1829
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:26,320
it.

1830
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:27,320
So we'll see.

1831
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:30,680
Keep in mind the networking side of it and the web play side of this.

1832
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:35,160
Remember back, remember we had the X link back in the day.

1833
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:37,920
We had, well in Japan they had Satellaview.

1834
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:40,440
So it's not a new concept.

1835
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:41,920
It's a perfected concept.

1836
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:46,320
But it's, it's now, it's penetrate, excuse me, it's penetrated the marketplace and had

1837
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:49,480
its effect on society that Satellaview didn't, nobody remembers Satellaview.

1838
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:54,520
What was a novel concept then is, and actually I didn't even have to say one of the biggest

1839
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:59,960
games that came out that really brought that on was Phantasy Star Online, if you think

1840
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:00,960
about it.

1841
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:04,600
Cause you could get on and chat with your friends and it was on a console that you could

1842
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:06,640
do this back onto the Dreamcast.

1843
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:07,680
So I mean that was a big thing.

1844
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:12,360
But unfortunately it wasn't until you had like World of Warcraft perfected the MMO in

1845
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:13,360
some ways.

1846
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:14,920
I guess you get to give some of that to EverQuest as well.

1847
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:18,000
Then again, Ragnarok Online was my big crack.

1848
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,760
But again, society, most people know Warcraft.

1849
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:22,760
I'd really say maybe it's the advent of the MMO.

1850
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:27,600
But you see, you know, and I'm really trying to take that question as literal as possible

1851
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:28,880
is what's the biggest impact on society?

1852
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:32,800
Cause if you ask what's my favorite, well the Super Nintendo was my favorite console

1853
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:33,800
in that whole generation.

1854
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:35,480
Nintendo versus Sega and Turbo Graphics.

1855
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:38,680
I mean that was like right when I was in high school and kind of growing up, I remember

1856
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:39,680
all that stuff.

1857
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:42,280
So that was, that was my favorite generation.

1858
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:45,560
But I don't think it necessarily had the biggest impact on society.

1859
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:47,200
I think that was more of a bridge.

1860
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:49,280
Video games were still a niche thing back then.

1861
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:53,720
It did create though a good deal of initial rivalry and discussion because back, you know,

1862
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:55,760
for a long time it was like, oh well you have an Atari.

1863
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:57,180
Oh now you have a ColecoVision.

1864
01:36:57,180 --> 01:37:00,480
There wasn't really a big contest between many of the systems.

1865
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:03,120
Because really what was coming out was one upping the other.

1866
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:06,160
Until you start getting, you know, actual competition going.

1867
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:09,600
Like it's funny, you know, I grew up with my Super Nintendo with my Nintendo.

1868
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:13,320
Dan grew up with Master System and Genesis.

1869
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:14,320
You know.

1870
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:15,320
So I bring the Nintendo love.

1871
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:16,480
He brings the Sega love.

1872
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:20,880
Of course I've developed my Sega love, you know, after I, you know, got to sit down and

1873
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,640
play the Saturn for a long, long time.

1874
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:27,160
But it's, it's an evolution.

1875
01:37:27,160 --> 01:37:32,800
It really just, I think that's why I want to go back very far back to the, to Pinball

1876
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:34,960
Rob to Pinball.

1877
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:38,960
Some comments from our chat room, chat.orangelaunchradio.com, live on this Sunday night as we tape at

1878
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:39,960
All Games Radio.

1879
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:45,800
Gia, I'm sorry, Sharan says, World of Warcraft just standardized both the best and worst

1880
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:47,040
of MMO tropes.

1881
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:50,600
Again, it's not necessarily about inventing a concept, it's about perfecting it.

1882
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:53,400
I think is an important point that was brought up.

1883
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:55,080
Anyway, that was a great question.

1884
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:57,760
So I'm going to give an honorary gold star to Salvax.

1885
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:58,960
He gets a Twitter gold star.

1886
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:01,900
I don't think we've given any of those out, but that was one of my favorite Twitter questions

1887
01:38:01,900 --> 01:38:03,040
we've gotten ever.

1888
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:05,280
So gold star for you.

1889
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:08,720
Robocoon wants to clue us in on a Steam UI update.

1890
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:10,720
It's a beta thing that you can opt into, and that's good.

1891
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:14,160
I think Steam could use a little bit of a facelift.

1892
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:17,540
I'm not, I haven't read this story as familiar as myself with it in advance, but apparently

1893
01:38:17,540 --> 01:38:23,400
you can take part in the beta by going into Steam's website in the settings link and then

1894
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:27,060
selecting the 2010 UI update under beta participation.

1895
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:29,760
But I'm looking at these screenshots and I got to say one thing that does kind of worry

1896
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:34,880
me as I'm noticing in one of these screenshots, there's like a list that shows community activity

1897
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,880
and it shows what games your friends are buying.

1898
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:40,560
I don't know if I want that data like out there and published.

1899
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:43,960
Like I don't want my friends knowing that I just bought the amazing unicorn game.

1900
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:47,080
You know, I'm hoping there's a way to suppress that.

1901
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:49,080
Imagine fairies.

1902
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:51,800
I'm sure there is a way to suppress that.

1903
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:55,760
But there is, there's some unicorn game that's out there on Steam and my boyfriend's been

1904
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:58,600
tempting me with this saying, you know you want this game, you know you want this game.

1905
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:02,080
When obviously it looks like such crap, but it's kind of one of those things like I want

1906
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:04,020
to like buy it for you as a gift.

1907
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:06,760
So you're obligated to play it and then you have to talk about it on next week.

1908
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:08,400
So LR during how was your gaming week?

1909
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:11,520
Like I think we actually have conversation.

1910
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:13,520
Are you pulling it up right now or what?

1911
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:14,520
Sure.

1912
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:15,520
I'm going on my Steam.

1913
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:18,160
Look, look for the unicorn game or I'm going to get a text message in a minute.

1914
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:21,560
That'll tell me what it is, but magical unicorn game.

1915
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:23,320
It's something about magical unicorns.

1916
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:24,320
There's an awesome.

1917
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:25,320
Okay.

1918
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:30,040
It's not even God, here we go, no, no, no, no, no, no, no tangent train, no, no, no,

1919
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:31,040
no.

1920
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:32,040
Tangent train.

1921
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:36,640
This is actually, there's another magical unicorn game that's on, no, don't get me wrong.

1922
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:40,720
It's a commercial for this cause I watch Cartoon Network and Adult Swim sometimes.

1923
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:42,280
They have a new game on their website.

1924
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:44,480
Oh yeah, the farting unicorn rainbow game.

1925
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:45,480
I played that.

1926
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:49,400
I don't know about farting unicorn game, but it's just this unicorn that's jumping in the

1927
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:54,520
commercial and running around and stuff with the, with, I forget what music it, it set

1928
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:58,160
this on like eighties rock band music or something.

1929
01:39:58,160 --> 01:39:59,160
I got to find that.

1930
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:00,160
I've played this.

1931
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:01,160
I have played this.

1932
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:06,120
The chat room is urging us to check the hallway to make sure Shirmi hasn't taken another crap

1933
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:09,720
on this topic.

1934
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:10,720
Do you smell shit?

1935
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:12,120
I don't think so.

1936
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:17,960
All right, well, while you're looking that up, let me get a couple of these other tweets

1937
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:19,800
out of the way here at our Twitter.

1938
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:25,240
Um, MNZeba sends us a Twitter, it says new copy protection technology outrages gamers.

1939
01:40:25,240 --> 01:40:27,480
Not sure if this is already said, and this is the link.

1940
01:40:27,480 --> 01:40:29,140
I believe this is talking about Ubisoft.

1941
01:40:29,140 --> 01:40:31,040
So yeah, we have brought this up on a previous episode.

1942
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:34,840
It was brought up a couple of weeks ago, but I think this is still worth sharing.

1943
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:38,840
So thank you for the tweet because now it's penetrated like Yahoo and it's starting to

1944
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:41,800
get onto the mainstream sites about this copy protection.

1945
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:45,840
It's a robot unicorn attack is what the game's called.

1946
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:50,560
It's it's secret of the magic crystals. Rob is the one that you're looking for.

1947
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:51,600
Is that it?

1948
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:53,440
It's also gone down to $6.99.

1949
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:54,440
I think.

1950
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:55,440
Oh, wow.

1951
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:56,440
That's a bargain.

1952
01:40:56,440 --> 01:40:57,440
Hold on.

1953
01:40:57,440 --> 01:40:58,440
I just got a text message.

1954
01:40:58,440 --> 01:40:59,440
Hold on.

1955
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:00,440
I'm firing up my phone.

1956
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:04,280
And the screenshot where you do crafting with a magic material called anus.

1957
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:05,280
That's right.

1958
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:09,440
When one of the screenshots, there's a magical crafting, I don't know if it deleted his first

1959
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:12,360
text where he told me the name of the game, but yeah, that's the game.

1960
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:13,360
What is it?

1961
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:15,880
What is it again?

1962
01:41:15,880 --> 01:41:18,440
I just found the name, the secret of the magic crystals.

1963
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:19,720
Yes, that's it.

1964
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:20,720
It's a game about unicorns.

1965
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:24,440
And in one of those screens, if you look at one of the screenshots, okay, look there,

1966
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:29,960
there, there's a crafting material on that screen called anus.

1967
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:34,400
If you look at it, one of the, like you have to collect anus, but it's A-E-N-U-S.

1968
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:39,600
A-E-N-U-S. Yeah, there it is.

1969
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:40,600
As pink.

1970
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:48,320
You have to collect all the pink anus you can.

1971
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:50,480
You know you want that game.

1972
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:52,640
Fuck it.

1973
01:41:52,640 --> 01:41:53,640
Add to cart.

1974
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:54,640
Reverse.

1975
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:55,640
Did you really?

1976
01:41:55,640 --> 01:41:56,640
Are you buying the game?

1977
01:41:56,640 --> 01:41:57,760
I'm buying it.

1978
01:41:57,760 --> 01:41:59,760
Right now I'm buying it for seven bucks.

1979
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:00,760
Congratulations, Alan.

1980
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:01,760
Good job.

1981
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:02,760
All right.

1982
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:08,440
And I will have a full review of the gay unicorn game complete with anus and horn.

1983
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:09,440
All right.

1984
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:12,240
I don't know how the anus crafting goes a little later.

1985
01:42:12,240 --> 01:42:18,280
This might need to be our next, um, uh, cause here on the show that, that we yell and scream

1986
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:21,960
for everybody to tweet and Facebook about is to get this on the consoles because I want

1987
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:24,760
some pink anus on my Xbox 360.

1988
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:29,960
This game, apparently the robot unicorn attack or whatever has a really interesting song

1989
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:34,880
that plays in the background, although I haven't played it yet, but on the commercial it sounded

1990
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:35,880
funny.

1991
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:38,080
It's, uh, the chat room is, uh, it's erasure always.

1992
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:45,280
Cause I, in fact, I actually made a live journal post on this like a while back.

1993
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:50,680
No, I posted it on Twitter.

1994
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:51,680
Hold on.

1995
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:54,200
Here's, here's a little bit, just so, just so you have something to reference here.

1996
01:42:54,200 --> 01:43:05,800
Loki is the actual, oh yeah, that's actually one of my favorite erasure songs.

1997
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:08,440
Erasure is a great synthball fan.

1998
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:11,440
I love that one too.

1999
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:12,440
Yeah.

2000
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:20,200
This is, you play this game to unicorns, to unicorns running and farting rainbows.

2001
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:27,640
Here we go, Rob, let's see here.

2002
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:30,280
Well now Loki's Loki's fired this up in studio.

2003
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:31,280
What is this?

2004
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:32,280
Is this a flash game?

2005
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:33,280
Yeah.

2006
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:45,320
Oh my gosh, your unicorn was all twisted in a big pile up in the ground.

2007
01:43:45,320 --> 01:43:46,760
Can you post this link in chat please?

2008
01:43:46,760 --> 01:43:47,760
This is so awesome.

2009
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:49,160
Can you post this link in chat?

2010
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:50,160
Yeah.

2011
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:51,760
Okay, thank you.

2012
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:52,760
Maybe put it on the Twitter.

2013
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:55,680
Can you post it to the Twitter that we're talking about it on the show right now?

2014
01:43:55,680 --> 01:43:57,120
You know the password and all that.

2015
01:43:57,120 --> 01:43:58,120
All right.

2016
01:43:58,120 --> 01:43:59,120
Please post that to the Twitter.

2017
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:00,920
That's why I just downloaded the song.

2018
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:01,920
Yeah.

2019
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:02,920
Thank you.

2020
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:03,920
Thank you.

2021
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:04,920
Thank you, Dark Tetsuya.

2022
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:05,920
Orange Tansit Radio.

2023
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:06,920
Oh yeah.

2024
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:10,640
So the original tweet had to do with copy protection from Ubisoft.

2025
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:11,640
Yeah.

2026
01:44:11,640 --> 01:44:14,520
Now it's in the mainstream press and I was just going to say that it's interesting that

2027
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:19,360
now, you know, that digital copyright stuff has been screwed up so bad it's in the mainstream

2028
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:20,360
press.

2029
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:23,920
30 minutes into part B and we're still on Twitter topics, just FYI.

2030
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:32,080
And then lastly, a tweet from Alex P Carson wanting us to give a shout out to Alex Nicole.

2031
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:33,520
It's her first time listening.

2032
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:35,040
Shout out.

2033
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:36,560
Shout out.

2034
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:39,200
Hopefully she didn't turn it off after the farting rainbows chat.

2035
01:44:39,200 --> 01:44:41,360
I hope we didn't scare her off.

2036
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:42,360
All right.

2037
01:44:42,360 --> 01:44:45,400
Anyhow, and Amazed Shitsuma in chat.

2038
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:46,400
Yes, he changed his name.

2039
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:51,000
Amazed Shitsuma says Orange Lounge Unicornio is the new name of the show apparently.

2040
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,880
Who doesn't love unicorns?

2041
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:54,280
Like evil people.

2042
01:44:54,280 --> 01:44:55,280
All right.

2043
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:58,380
Anyhow, Loki, I hate to interrupt you because I know you're running to the Twitter right

2044
01:44:58,380 --> 01:45:04,680
now to post, but Loki, can you give us some more gaming news here on OPLR?

2045
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:08,680
It was very distracting, but that game was awesome.

2046
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:15,880
Anyways, so there's some cool stuff coming to Final Fantasy 11, believe it or not.

2047
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:21,680
They just announced that three new battle arenas are coming to Final Fantasy 11.

2048
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:28,920
And those, of course, have to do, I guess, with Abyssia, and it's going to have, let's

2049
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:33,940
see here, Vision of Abyssia, I guess will come out during the summer, with the other

2050
01:45:33,940 --> 01:45:38,800
two Scars of Abyssia and Heroes of Abyssia coming soon after that.

2051
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:44,600
And each new area can be purchased for $10 on the Play Online viewer.

2052
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:47,240
I'm surprised that there's still expansions coming out to this.

2053
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:49,980
I'm not really sure what these new battle arenas are.

2054
01:45:49,980 --> 01:45:53,560
I mean, this is something that was added way after I left, so.

2055
01:45:53,560 --> 01:45:57,320
I totally realized that I never finished my other Twitter topics.

2056
01:45:57,320 --> 01:45:58,320
You never what?

2057
01:45:58,320 --> 01:45:59,320
Not my Twitter topics.

2058
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:00,320
They're rapid fire.

2059
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:01,320
Well, then we'll come back to it in a moment here.

2060
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:02,320
It's fine.

2061
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:03,320
That's all right.

2062
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:10,180
But quickly, I wanted to say about Final Fantasy 11 and its developments and what have you,

2063
01:46:10,180 --> 01:46:13,640
this should kind of squelch those rumors that Final Fantasy 11's shutting down in a couple

2064
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:17,800
months to make room for 14, which I always thought was a little bit ridiculous, how fast

2065
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:19,240
that spread like wildfire.

2066
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:26,960
But this I'm sure is in part to shut up those rumors that 11 is still being supported.

2067
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:29,200
You're not going to fit in there, Shirmi.

2068
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:30,200
What's Shirmi trying?

2069
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:31,200
Oh, Shirmi's trying to...

2070
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:33,080
She's trying to poop on the mixing board.

2071
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:34,080
It's not working.

2072
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:35,080
She's trying.

2073
01:46:35,080 --> 01:46:36,080
End the show.

2074
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:37,080
End the show.

2075
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:38,080
All right.

2076
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:41,120
You got a little more for us, Logi?

2077
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:42,120
Yes.

2078
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:47,000
Also, Final Fantasy 14 will be going into closed beta soon, actually.

2079
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:59,560
Starting March 11th, and I believe that they did have the VanaFest, I guess, the 2010 website,

2080
01:46:59,560 --> 01:47:00,560
which was some...

2081
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:04,000
They had some news, I guess, about Final Fantasy 11 as well.

2082
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:11,680
But on the Play Online website, there's also interesting news, I guess, that the betas

2083
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:15,220
will start on March 11th, and I think I've already signed up for this.

2084
01:47:15,220 --> 01:47:16,640
I want to say I've already signed up for the beta.

2085
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:19,040
Yeah, I signed up for it too, but my email box was empty.

2086
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:22,120
I don't know about yours, but I saw that story and then I cried.

2087
01:47:22,120 --> 01:47:23,120
I haven't got anything yet either.

2088
01:47:23,120 --> 01:47:24,120
But hey, you know what?

2089
01:47:24,120 --> 01:47:26,640
There's still time, so maybe.

2090
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:29,480
Maybe it's one of those things where I won't be in the first wave, maybe a later wave.

2091
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:30,480
I'll be hopeful.

2092
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:35,280
But it gives me time to finish playing 13, because seriously, the beta for 14 is coming

2093
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:38,440
out two days after 13.

2094
01:47:38,440 --> 01:47:41,760
Two days between Final Fantasy titles in the US, if you think about it.

2095
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:42,760
That's kind of strange.

2096
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:46,880
Well, and here's something else, if you think about it, if it's going into the beta now,

2097
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:49,880
maybe those May release dates are a little bit more accurate.

2098
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:53,520
I don't know about May, but I bet the end of the year.

2099
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:56,320
It sounds like Final Fantasy 14 will be out by the end of the year, and that's kind of

2100
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:57,320
weird.

2101
01:47:57,320 --> 01:48:01,760
Like, I was not expecting it that soon, especially with 13 having taken as long as it did.

2102
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:03,960
So pleasant surprise, I suppose.

2103
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:04,960
Yes.

2104
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:05,960
Alright.

2105
01:48:05,960 --> 01:48:10,700
Let's go over to Dark Sakura and whatever stories we skipped over because of all our

2106
01:48:10,700 --> 01:48:12,720
discussions on unicorns.

2107
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:14,680
Acorn farting.

2108
01:48:14,680 --> 01:48:22,120
Well, just quick stuff, SNK Playmore announced that King of Fighters 13, whatever, it better

2109
01:48:22,120 --> 01:48:29,120
not suck like 12 did, but it's going to be run on Tytos Type X2 arcade hardware, the

2110
01:48:29,120 --> 01:48:31,880
same one that Street Fighter 4, BlazBlue, blah blah.

2111
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:35,560
And hopefully it'll leak online, just like BlazBlue did.

2112
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:43,640
And then there's an online Digimon battle game that's supposed to be coming out in the

2113
01:48:43,640 --> 01:48:47,760
US that's a version of the Korean Digimon RPG, which I actually, I think I'll freaking

2114
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:50,720
play that because I love Digimon.

2115
01:48:50,720 --> 01:48:51,720
I know you do.

2116
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:54,260
Dude, I was a big fan- I think it's ironic that this story's coming

2117
01:48:54,260 --> 01:48:57,320
out this week, because didn't we have some big discussion last week on Pokemon?

2118
01:48:57,320 --> 01:49:03,160
Yeah, we were talking about like Pokemon versus, it was in the OLR Madness that's going on

2119
01:49:03,160 --> 01:49:04,440
on the forums right now with the game voting.

2120
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:07,320
We were talking about Pokemon, you were like, whatever, I'm still into Digimon.

2121
01:49:07,320 --> 01:49:14,680
Well, you know, I actually, I liked Digimon Zero 2 enough to have the movie on DVD, the

2122
01:49:14,680 --> 01:49:21,720
Japanese version of it on DVD, and um, well, a couple of movies, and I have like the first

2123
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:25,240
two volumes of it on, of the Japanese version on DVD.

2124
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:30,100
Someone I used to date a long time ago, just went on a couple dates with, made me watch

2125
01:49:30,100 --> 01:49:31,400
the Digimon movie.

2126
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:32,400
I remember that.

2127
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:36,480
You should watch the Japanese one, you should watch the Japanese one, it's actually really

2128
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:37,480
good.

2129
01:49:37,480 --> 01:49:38,480
Is it?

2130
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:39,480
I think I saw the English one.

2131
01:49:39,480 --> 01:49:45,920
So, alright, anyhow, going back into some other longer topics tonight, this one is one

2132
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:49,360
that somewhat hits close to home, let me talk about this.

2133
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:53,460
This is Activision doing a little bit of a douchey move this week.

2134
01:49:53,460 --> 01:49:58,360
They have pulled the plug on what was a fan project for the King's Quest series.

2135
01:49:58,360 --> 01:50:02,120
Now we've talked about this on the show before, it was a long time ago, but you might remember

2136
01:50:02,120 --> 01:50:03,720
the Silver Lining.

2137
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:07,320
At one point this was called King's Quest IX, the Silver Lining, but then due to an

2138
01:50:07,320 --> 01:50:12,160
agreement with Vivendi, who bought the rights to all the old Sierra games, they had to take

2139
01:50:12,160 --> 01:50:16,560
out King's Quest out of the name, and they could develop this as like a community project

2140
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:18,560
with the Silver Lining.

2141
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:20,080
So they reached this little settlement.

2142
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:24,720
Well now, Activision owns it, because of all the acquisitions that go on and so forth,

2143
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:28,420
and Activision has demanded that this game stop completely.

2144
01:50:28,420 --> 01:50:31,320
They're not honoring the old agreement.

2145
01:50:31,320 --> 01:50:34,360
They have demanded that this cease and desist immediately.

2146
01:50:34,360 --> 01:50:35,360
Fuck them!

2147
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:39,240
Phoenix Online has been doing this game since 2002.

2148
01:50:39,240 --> 01:50:43,840
And then yeah, so Activision has basically said, even though they don't have plans on

2149
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:48,400
doing a sequel themselves, by the way, King's Quest is pretty much dead.

2150
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:50,700
I think they should release it anyway.

2151
01:50:50,700 --> 01:50:54,200
Well they don't want to get sued, so I can't say I necessarily blame them.

2152
01:50:54,200 --> 01:50:56,920
Change the name and release it for free.

2153
01:50:56,920 --> 01:51:02,200
Now we actually, I believe we had one of the developers on the show many, many years ago.

2154
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:07,360
I think you'd have to go back to old, like the To-Go podcast from 2005-2006 to find this,

2155
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:10,720
but I want to say we had the guy on the show, because I remember going to some virtual press

2156
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:15,980
conference online thing about it, and we also hosted a mirror of one of the early betas

2157
01:51:15,980 --> 01:51:18,860
for the game, I believe when it was still called King's Quest.

2158
01:51:18,860 --> 01:51:22,520
I think one of the big things they were touting, if I remember right, again this was like four

2159
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:27,020
or five years ago, so please, my memory's a little shoddy, was that Roberta Williams

2160
01:51:27,020 --> 01:51:31,340
actually knew of the project, and although she couldn't officially give it her blessing,

2161
01:51:31,340 --> 01:51:34,400
she kind of gave it a wink and a nod, you know what I mean?

2162
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:36,800
We hosted the beta for this.

2163
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:41,640
I don't believe it went anywhere, I believe it's still on our website at orangelaunchradio.com

2164
01:51:41,640 --> 01:51:43,120
slash tsl.

2165
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:47,160
I didn't get a letter, so do you want to see what this is all about?

2166
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:48,160
Have fun!

2167
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:53,520
I think it's kind of a douchey thing for Activision to do, when they know they're not, I mean

2168
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:57,280
I realize they're in their rights to do it, just like when Nintendo shut down the movie

2169
01:51:57,280 --> 01:52:00,960
project, they were, the Zelda movie, we talked about this a couple months ago, they were

2170
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:06,300
in their rights to do it, but with Activision just having bought this, saying they're not

2171
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:10,040
going to do anything with it, but then putting the plug on this, when they already stripped

2172
01:52:10,040 --> 01:52:16,120
anything that was King's Quest related out of it, that's just douchey.

2173
01:52:16,120 --> 01:52:20,920
Activision gets our douche of the week award, there you go.

2174
01:52:20,920 --> 01:52:26,180
So I think that's unfortunate, and you know my thought is, I'm kind of with Jamie, I say

2175
01:52:26,180 --> 01:52:30,060
release it anyway, it's a torrent, but if you're really afraid of getting the pantsuit

2176
01:52:30,060 --> 01:52:35,480
off of you, seriously go back, change the name, change some of the text, change the

2177
01:52:35,480 --> 01:52:38,960
characters, nobody's going to freaking know.

2178
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:41,440
Activision is not going to seek it out that hardcore.

2179
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:45,120
If you go in and change the information so it's hard to detect that it once was the silver

2180
01:52:45,120 --> 01:52:48,280
lining, I bet you you'll have it.

2181
01:52:48,280 --> 01:52:49,280
We'll see.

2182
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:52,520
I'm curious to see if the game gets leaked, I bet it does, and once it hits the internet

2183
01:52:52,520 --> 01:52:54,880
there is no going back.

2184
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:55,880
We'll see.

2185
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:59,120
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us up next?

2186
01:52:59,120 --> 01:53:06,520
Well, in other news we have a game called Voice Fantasy.

2187
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:12,760
Square Enix has put a final trademark for it in Europe, and maybe it could be a Final

2188
01:53:12,760 --> 01:53:20,160
Fantasy vocal CD, maybe, who knows, but it could be something cool, hopefully it will

2189
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:21,160
be cool.

2190
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:27,760
Maybe it'll be like a sing-star voice fantasy or something too.

2191
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:31,920
I guess it could be a karaoke controlled Final Fantasy 1, right?

2192
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:35,480
Or maybe one that you have to sing to progress your game or something.

2193
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:39,360
I want to fight, I want to cast holy.

2194
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:42,800
Or maybe you have to sing accurately to progress.

2195
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:46,000
Are you still playing the fucking unicorn game?

2196
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,000
Yes.

2197
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:48,000
God.

2198
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:52,440
Amaze Shitsuma in chat says, douche of the week award, so Shirmi will poop on them.

2199
01:53:52,440 --> 01:53:58,040
Yes, we give a big Shirmi poop award to the folks at Activision this week.

2200
01:53:58,040 --> 01:54:01,600
The next time she takes a shit on the floor I'll take a picture of it so we can just send

2201
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:02,600
it to whoever.

2202
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:04,760
I like that idea.

2203
01:54:04,760 --> 01:54:05,760
That's a good idea.

2204
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:09,480
Loki, put down the game and read some news for us.

2205
01:54:09,480 --> 01:54:10,480
Okay.

2206
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:16,320
No, this is not a big surprise because I don't think it's really taken off as far as I'm

2207
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:17,320
aware.

2208
01:54:17,320 --> 01:54:18,320
PlayStation Home.

2209
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:23,520
Apparently advertisers are ignoring PlayStation Home, but they are interested in the PlayStation

2210
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:24,520
Network.

2211
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:31,920
Apparently a report coming from Brandweek saying that they're opting to pursue opportunities

2212
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:33,520
in Xbox Live instead.

2213
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:43,280
Apparently ad agency, looks like a publicist, Danaud, John Rafferty, they told the website

2214
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:48,480
from the moment one, or from moment one it felt kind of clunky.

2215
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:54,360
And once you got through that there wasn't much there regarding I guess the robotic nature

2216
01:54:54,360 --> 01:54:57,080
of PlayStation Home.

2217
01:54:57,080 --> 01:55:02,160
And I think, I mean it kind of makes sense because there's a lot of places to advertise

2218
01:55:02,160 --> 01:55:08,320
in PlayStation Home but if you're like me, you don't use PlayStation Home so you're not

2219
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:15,360
seeing those ads so it makes more sense to put it on like say, you know, banner ads that

2220
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:19,120
are on the PlayStation Network or banner ads on the Xbox Live Marketplace because you're

2221
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:21,920
seeing those as you're going browsing for other things.

2222
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:24,040
I think you hit the nail on the head.

2223
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:28,520
There's no reason to go into PlayStation Home except when they launch something new that's

2224
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:32,280
usually you go in there once and you go, oh, huh, and then that's it.

2225
01:55:32,280 --> 01:55:33,280
Neat.

2226
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:35,240
Just like that, remember that salt that was on there?

2227
01:55:35,240 --> 01:55:36,240
Yeah, yeah.

2228
01:55:36,240 --> 01:55:37,240
Yeah, went there once.

2229
01:55:37,240 --> 01:55:40,400
Yeah, I went in there a couple of times and played it and got some of the little things

2230
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:42,400
and I was like, okay, done.

2231
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:43,400
Yeah.

2232
01:55:43,400 --> 01:55:46,640
Because I think they wanted you to pay for like more and I was like, I don't really want

2233
01:55:46,640 --> 01:55:47,640
to pay for this.

2234
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:48,640
Yeah.

2235
01:55:48,640 --> 01:55:52,920
It's not really, I mean it's just a souped up version of a game I played on my 386 computer

2236
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:56,380
back in like 1993, you know.

2237
01:55:56,380 --> 01:55:59,320
Not really into it.

2238
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:03,200
Well something that a lot of people are into is the idea of Nintendo starting over with

2239
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:04,680
a brand new Wii.

2240
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:11,720
Well it came out at the Nintendo Media Summit thanks to a GameSpot cornering Cami Dunaway.

2241
01:56:11,720 --> 01:56:17,520
Basically they say that there's not going to be a Wii successor anytime soon.

2242
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:20,600
Apparently they're kind of looking for what happened with the PS2 is that they want to

2243
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:24,760
kind of re-emulate the fact that they're on top for years and years.

2244
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:28,360
Cami Dunaway was quoted in the GameSpot interview saying quote, even though our install base

2245
01:56:28,360 --> 01:56:33,240
is at this point 5 million households larger than the PS2 install base was at the same

2246
01:56:33,240 --> 01:56:36,760
point in the life cycle, it still has a lot of room to grow.

2247
01:56:36,760 --> 01:56:40,080
If you think PS2, there's been about 50 million sold.

2248
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:42,900
Wii close to 25, 28 million sold.

2249
01:56:42,900 --> 01:56:47,000
So it says to me there's still a big audience out there that we can access with the Wii.

2250
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:53,240
So basically we still have sold shitloads of these systems so why would we start over

2251
01:56:53,240 --> 01:56:54,320
with something new?

2252
01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:56,260
Just because the core gamers are mad.

2253
01:56:56,260 --> 01:56:57,360
The soccer moms are happy.

2254
01:56:57,360 --> 01:56:59,320
So F you.

2255
01:56:59,320 --> 01:57:03,180
It's raining money at my world hahaha.

2256
01:57:03,180 --> 01:57:07,480
So don't expect a new Wii to be announced at E3 this year.

2257
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:14,080
But I think in great Nintendo fashion their way around this would be releasing the Wii

2258
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:21,440
HD or something along those lines where it's not necessarily a whole new system but it's

2259
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:25,200
a Wii plus like the DS Lite or something like that, you know what I mean?

2260
01:57:25,200 --> 01:57:29,120
That's what I could see Nintendo doing and then saying well it's still a Wii.

2261
01:57:29,120 --> 01:57:30,120
Yeah.

2262
01:57:30,120 --> 01:57:32,360
I don't know.

2263
01:57:32,360 --> 01:57:33,600
We'll see.

2264
01:57:33,600 --> 01:57:38,520
Alright anyhow we're gonna get into that section of the show where we interact with your emails.

2265
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:42,560
It's the mailbag segment here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2266
01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:45,920
Every week Dark Sakura opens up the mailbag.

2267
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:48,440
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2268
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:54,000
It's all one word, mailbag, M-A-I-L-B-A-G at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you have an email

2269
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,160
you want Dark Sakura to read.

2270
01:57:55,160 --> 01:57:58,280
Looks like a lot of people took the opportunity this week, didn't they Dark Sakura?

2271
01:57:58,280 --> 01:57:59,280
Yeah.

2272
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:01,440
Alright well get to reading.

2273
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:04,440
Hey OLR Kardashians, okay.

2274
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:09,400
I just discovered that I could walk from where I live to Valve's headquarters, yeah.

2275
01:58:09,400 --> 01:58:12,920
And there's a Gameworks in downtown Seattle that has BlazBlue, Street Fighter 4, Tatsunoko

2276
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:18,480
vs Capcom, King of Fighters 1 million, and a few pinball thingies so if you ever are

2277
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:20,280
up there for PAX I would recommend stopping by.

2278
01:58:20,280 --> 01:58:21,280
We went there.

2279
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:22,280
Yeah we did.

2280
01:58:22,280 --> 01:58:23,280
We did stop by.

2281
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:25,640
They had that whole room of Sega cranes, right?

2282
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:26,640
Yeah.

2283
01:58:26,640 --> 01:58:27,640
Yeah.

2284
01:58:27,640 --> 01:58:28,640
And I played a few.

2285
01:58:28,640 --> 01:58:31,440
Oh since I'm entering high school I was wondering if I should learn Japanese.

2286
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:32,440
Is it hard?

2287
01:58:32,440 --> 01:58:37,000
I would kind of want to know what my important future is telling me.

2288
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:40,040
Typed with minor precision at 1240 AM, Austin.

2289
01:58:40,040 --> 01:58:46,460
Just to let you know, Japanese is not an easy language because honestly I think the biggest

2290
01:58:46,460 --> 01:58:49,560
difficulty in Japanese is the grammar.

2291
01:58:49,560 --> 01:58:52,400
Not necessarily the vocabulary but the grammar.

2292
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:53,720
It's a little convoluted.

2293
01:58:53,720 --> 01:58:57,360
I was a Japanese major for a little while.

2294
01:58:57,360 --> 01:59:01,080
I know a few sites that will give you beginner lessons.

2295
01:59:01,080 --> 01:59:03,360
You can find them for free.

2296
01:59:03,360 --> 01:59:07,460
I think one is called iLearn or something but yeah just try a couple of those little

2297
01:59:07,460 --> 01:59:13,240
online sites and see what you think because I mean it really is kind of a convoluted in

2298
01:59:13,240 --> 01:59:15,360
comparison to English.

2299
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:18,680
It really depends on what industry you want to get into when you get older and maybe you're

2300
01:59:18,680 --> 01:59:21,720
too young to know that now if you're just kind of like now going into high school which

2301
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:24,440
you're probably too young to listen to this show actually so but.

2302
01:59:24,440 --> 01:59:28,840
Also depending on where you live because when I lived in Alabama it was good for me to know

2303
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:29,940
French.

2304
01:59:29,940 --> 01:59:32,960
And here in California it's really good to know Spanish.

2305
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:34,000
It's really good to know it.

2306
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:38,160
I mean that's just you know there's a lot of jobs out there where they really want bilingual

2307
01:59:38,160 --> 01:59:40,880
people that speak Spanish so you might want to think about that.

2308
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:43,240
I mean is Japanese really practical?

2309
01:59:43,240 --> 01:59:47,520
Well if you wanted to get into an industry that has to do with technology and possibly

2310
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:51,800
you know relocating to Japan or working closely with Japanese business or finances.

2311
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:52,800
Or going into the JET program.

2312
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:57,520
Yeah any of that you know then yeah Japanese is going to be a practical language to learn.

2313
01:59:57,520 --> 02:00:00,280
Again you might be a little young to really know what you want to do.

2314
02:00:00,280 --> 02:00:02,400
When I was 15 I hadn't a clue.

2315
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:03,400
Well I did have a clue.

2316
02:00:03,400 --> 02:00:06,920
I wanted to be a game show host but that didn't quite pan out.

2317
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:12,080
I ended up changing my mind when I was like 24 on what I wanted to do.

2318
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:13,720
So I changed my major eight times.

2319
02:00:13,720 --> 02:00:15,480
Yeah and most people do.

2320
02:00:15,480 --> 02:00:17,660
But just try to think maybe like one step ahead.

2321
02:00:17,660 --> 02:00:21,480
Am I just learning this because I think it'd be cool or you know is there like maybe a

2322
02:00:21,480 --> 02:00:22,680
practical use to this.

2323
02:00:22,680 --> 02:00:25,880
I think you'll thank yourself later.

2324
02:00:25,880 --> 02:00:29,960
Anyhow yeah but I agree with the Kuma JP.

2325
02:00:29,960 --> 02:00:31,140
Do it while you're young.

2326
02:00:31,140 --> 02:00:33,840
Learn a new language because it's much harder when you're older.

2327
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:36,600
And I tried to learn a second language in high school.

2328
02:00:36,600 --> 02:00:41,520
I tried to learn Spanish and unfortunately I this is going to sound terrible because

2329
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:45,040
you know I am a teacher of sorts even though I teach in a corporate environment as my day

2330
02:00:45,040 --> 02:00:47,000
job.

2331
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:51,560
And I think teachers do great things but I had a Spanish teacher that was so terrible

2332
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:53,360
she actually ruined Spanish for me.

2333
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:57,060
Like I was not able to learn a language because this lady was so bad.

2334
02:00:57,060 --> 02:00:58,400
Thankfully she's not teaching anymore.

2335
02:00:58,400 --> 02:01:00,720
She didn't she didn't keep teaching very long.

2336
02:01:00,720 --> 02:01:04,920
But it's unfortunate that that one person kind of screwed it up.

2337
02:01:04,920 --> 02:01:05,920
You know.

2338
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:09,840
I accidentally closed one of the emails and I don't remember which one it is.

2339
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:10,840
Uh oh.

2340
02:01:10,840 --> 02:01:11,840
Spiadio.

2341
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:13,040
Well okay.

2342
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:15,800
This is from Tolgak.

2343
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:19,600
After thinking about the Ubisoft DRM scheme I got to thinking what would happen if someone

2344
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:22,360
DDOS'd the servers.

2345
02:01:22,360 --> 02:01:27,480
It seems to me like that would be the perfect target for DDOS attack to cause maximum damage.

2346
02:01:27,480 --> 02:01:32,640
A normal DDOS would only disrupt traffic but an attack against Ubisoft servers would cause

2347
02:01:32,640 --> 02:01:35,680
everyone's games to shut off and swamp their phone line.

2348
02:01:35,680 --> 02:01:38,840
I was wondering what you guys thought about this problem.

2349
02:01:38,840 --> 02:01:42,880
As a side question I wanted to know what you guys thought about having a homebrew no piracy

2350
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:47,600
and tech themed show on all games co-hosted by me and Jaded.

2351
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:49,720
By the way awesome show on the 22nd.

2352
02:01:49,720 --> 02:01:50,720
Who's that from?

2353
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:51,720
Tolgak.

2354
02:01:51,720 --> 02:01:59,800
My first question about the um the I'm sorry the what oh the DDOS on the Ubisoft site sorry

2355
02:01:59,800 --> 02:02:04,000
I thought you had another comment um as far as that goes I think you just give another

2356
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:10,400
reason to add to the list of why this type of copyright protection is stupid so just

2357
02:02:10,400 --> 02:02:12,040
add that to the ongoing list.

2358
02:02:12,040 --> 02:02:13,240
You bring up a valid point.

2359
02:02:13,240 --> 02:02:16,920
If Ubisoft gets DDOS there's really nothing to stop it's the same thing as the server

2360
02:02:16,920 --> 02:02:19,080
going down for whatever technical reason.

2361
02:02:19,080 --> 02:02:22,160
As far as the question about your all games podcast um that's something that has to be

2362
02:02:22,160 --> 02:02:26,640
decided by the all games staff which um although we're happy to work with them we don't make

2363
02:02:26,640 --> 02:02:30,800
decisions there so uh you wanna check out all games dot com and I know there's links

2364
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:35,000
there on like how to submit your show and so forth so just kinda dig around there um

2365
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:39,040
and I'm sure you'll find it or get in touch with me in chat and I can put you in touch

2366
02:02:39,040 --> 02:02:40,040
with the right people.

2367
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:41,800
New blood fresh meat.

2368
02:02:41,800 --> 02:02:45,160
Yeah I mean I know they're open to having more ideas and I know what one thing that

2369
02:02:45,160 --> 02:02:50,440
they don't want is they really don't want more general video game discussion shows cause

2370
02:02:50,440 --> 02:02:54,800
you know they already have a lot of them including us um admittedly although we've been doing

2371
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:58,480
what we do a long time uh but I think the idea of like a niche.

2372
02:02:58,480 --> 02:03:04,720
I don't know of well yeah I know we are but um I think also uh the idea of like a home

2373
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:09,920
brew and I don't know of a show like that on all games unless I'm really behind on who's

2374
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:13,680
on the network right now so I think that's always a good thing if you think of an idea

2375
02:03:13,680 --> 02:03:15,400
for a show that no one's done yet.

2376
02:03:15,400 --> 02:03:16,960
There you go.

2377
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:18,880
Okay well moving on.

2378
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:24,120
Hey OLR crew AZHP here again I was listening live to your show on Sunday though I wasn't

2379
02:03:24,120 --> 02:03:28,000
in chat because I was putting together Ikea furniture at the time I'm sorry.

2380
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:31,360
Anyway when I heard you all report on the Ubisoft DRM that requires you to be on the

2381
02:03:31,360 --> 02:03:36,800
internet constantly in order to play Assassin's Creed 2 my first thought was are Ubisoft insane?

2382
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:40,760
Do they want people to pirate their game because honestly once it's cracked the pirate versions

2383
02:03:40,760 --> 02:03:43,160
will actually be better than a retail copy.

2384
02:03:43,160 --> 02:03:46,920
You won't have to be connected to the internet to play and if your internet goes down during

2385
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:50,760
the middle of the game it won't matter PC Gamer apparently did a test run of the DRM

2386
02:03:50,760 --> 02:03:54,400
and if you are playing and your internet goes out you won't even get a chance to quick save

2387
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:56,200
before it boots you out of the game.

2388
02:03:56,200 --> 02:03:59,360
You lose all your progress since your last save.

2389
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:02,800
Someone obviously dropped the ball here and is completely out of touch with gamers.

2390
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:06,100
I was going to buy Assassin's Creed 2 but after hearing about this I don't think I will

2391
02:04:06,100 --> 02:04:07,240
anymore.

2392
02:04:07,240 --> 02:04:11,320
Now I don't think I'm going to pirate it since I'm not really interested in the game but

2393
02:04:11,320 --> 02:04:15,000
it doesn't seem like Ubisoft is actually encouraging people to pirate the game so they won't have

2394
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:19,280
to deal with that DRM yours truly is HP and I just think that they're stupid.

2395
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:23,560
I really have no comment I agree with your email 100% I really have nothing else to say

2396
02:04:23,560 --> 02:04:28,080
I think what you say is absolutely valid it's just encouraging piracy.

2397
02:04:28,080 --> 02:04:32,040
Alright next email it's kind of a cool email.

2398
02:04:32,040 --> 02:04:35,760
Hey OLR gang a quick question here I'm a techie very much like yourselves and I have a few

2399
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:39,280
electronics in the house however it's starting to become a problem as I have a few wires

2400
02:04:39,280 --> 02:04:41,720
just dangling and crossing under my gaming desk.

2401
02:04:41,720 --> 02:04:46,620
My Wii, Xbox 360, computer setup all share the same space do you have any personal home

2402
02:04:46,620 --> 02:04:51,760
solutions or recommendations for organizing an otherwise jungle of wires as well as saving

2403
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:55,280
me the time and money in the long run eliminating a potential fire hazard.

2404
02:04:55,280 --> 02:04:56,340
Randy from Texas.

2405
02:04:56,340 --> 02:05:01,400
I do I have a lot of suggestions because we do them please you can get a switch box first

2406
02:05:01,400 --> 02:05:06,680
of all for your systems you can also what we do in the studio is we have zip ties for

2407
02:05:06,680 --> 02:05:12,760
the although we don't really use them anymore but we have zip ties for our our cables for

2408
02:05:12,760 --> 02:05:17,520
our mics and for the the plugs and various hookups that way we can minimize what's there

2409
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:23,120
to trip over you can also get I believe you can get them at Fry's or any electronics store

2410
02:05:23,120 --> 02:05:27,620
or computer store or just in general you can actually buy them online they're these kind

2411
02:05:27,620 --> 02:05:33,640
of long twisty things that they look like the like the the plastic ring binders you

2412
02:05:33,640 --> 02:05:38,400
know they go on like presentation books and stuff but you wrap you bind your cords together

2413
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:43,320
and wrap them around your cords and then it leaves them as a long trail you can also duct

2414
02:05:43,320 --> 02:05:49,560
tape them to the floor I mean seriously my you can use electrical tape to bind them together

2415
02:05:49,560 --> 02:05:57,120
to my computer actually let me put in my my card my new graphics card we actually just

2416
02:05:57,120 --> 02:06:03,320
electrical taped all the bonus wires together so there's lots of stuff that you can do and

2417
02:06:03,320 --> 02:06:07,580
really you can get almost any of these things you know really cheap you can buy twist ties

2418
02:06:07,580 --> 02:06:12,400
you can get leftover ties we use in the studio or at the 99 cent store yeah I bought a pack

2419
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:17,760
of eight of them for a dollar you know so you just have to look around you know really

2420
02:06:17,760 --> 02:06:22,480
the thing that you want to do is find something that's going to be non flammable something

2421
02:06:22,480 --> 02:06:26,680
that can bind them together honestly if you want something that's going to hold them securely

2422
02:06:26,680 --> 02:06:32,360
your best bet get a switch box or if you have them you know multiple hookups to your TV

2423
02:06:32,360 --> 02:06:37,080
I would get electrical tape and bind the ones to each specific system together and also

2424
02:06:37,080 --> 02:06:41,440
if you leave them at the right length for your binding you can if you need to transport

2425
02:06:41,440 --> 02:06:46,600
them just unplug them and move them easily and labels go a long freaking way even though

2426
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:50,720
you might be thinking oh what a pain in the butt or you know they're so silly if you just

2427
02:06:50,720 --> 02:06:55,480
like label your wires at both ends oh my god you will be so happy later if you ever had

2428
02:06:55,480 --> 02:07:00,560
to move if you use the electrical tape method just get a sharpie right on the electrical

2429
02:07:00,560 --> 02:07:05,760
tape yeah ps3 you know it's very easy well you've seen the box of cables that we have

2430
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:09,480
rob obviously where it's like you sort of have to look at the end and guess what it

2431
02:07:09,480 --> 02:07:16,280
is and oh be afraid if you happen to find an n64 or a super nintendo thing because they

2432
02:07:16,280 --> 02:07:21,640
use the same ones practically you know or if you happen to accidentally hook up your

2433
02:07:21,640 --> 02:07:28,080
japanese playstation to you know adapter and then realize it won't fit in your us one and

2434
02:07:28,080 --> 02:07:32,960
you know i'm just going off because it really does it really does help of course we have

2435
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:39,720
big bins now in the vault where we keep all of that and don't know which one's which tape

2436
02:07:39,720 --> 02:07:48,400
all right also for speaker cables i'm just saying um you can get these uh plastic pieces

2437
02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:53,480
like for example if you're like we have our um surround sound wired and we didn't wire

2438
02:07:53,480 --> 02:07:57,320
it under the uh floor or anything yet but you can't and this is something i wanted to

2439
02:07:57,320 --> 02:08:01,680
do we haven't done it yet but you can get these plastic strips that you can adhere to

2440
02:08:01,680 --> 02:08:06,920
the floor that go the easement office buildings you know that to keep you from tripping over

2441
02:08:06,920 --> 02:08:13,400
wires that happen to be spread like for your speakers and whatnot so good suggestions yeah

2442
02:08:13,400 --> 02:08:17,840
you can find this anywhere just make sure that you get something that's you know electronic

2443
02:08:17,840 --> 02:08:27,300
safe and fire safe more emails one more it's long yay long email long email is long

2444
02:08:27,300 --> 02:08:32,960
i can't stop playing this are you still playing the magic unicorn game i'm gonna have a racer

2445
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:39,320
stuck in my head on i'm gonna be having nightmares about erasure hello there olr this is uh gditz

2446
02:08:39,320 --> 02:08:44,040
writing in i'm the swedish dude who called a few shows ago and talked about drm and seeing

2447
02:08:44,040 --> 02:08:48,840
as exams are closing and i can't really spare the time to attend the next live show so i

2448
02:08:48,840 --> 02:08:53,480
figured i'd answer the call for european to write about it oh good the high piracy rate

2449
02:08:53,480 --> 02:08:58,180
over here and what might be the cause of it first off i don't have a lot of insight on

2450
02:08:58,180 --> 02:09:02,560
how game releases or pricing works in italy where the highest rate of piracy occurred

2451
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:07,140
according to the study presented in last week's show i do however live in sweden where the

2452
02:09:07,140 --> 02:09:13,800
famous pirate bay bit torrent site was founded and where piracy is also frequent and now

2453
02:09:13,800 --> 02:09:18,760
there are quite a few factors as to why i have many times been tempted to pirate release

2454
02:09:18,760 --> 02:09:23,560
one of the biggest factors is for me whether or not i can purchase purchase a product legally

2455
02:09:23,560 --> 02:09:28,360
i hit something um when it comes to anime for example there usually isn't a retailer

2456
02:09:28,360 --> 02:09:32,140
around here to supply them if there is it's all dubbed or subbed in swedish which isn't

2457
02:09:32,140 --> 02:09:38,120
how i like my anime agreed i hate most english dubs you know i like watching when japanese

2458
02:09:38,120 --> 02:09:42,320
with subtitles another annoying thing is that the delay between us releasing the european

2459
02:09:42,320 --> 02:09:47,780
one usually it's usually a week or just a few days but once in a while a game takes

2460
02:09:47,780 --> 02:09:52,000
almost a full year to get over here one example is rock band 2 with the instrument bundle

2461
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:55,640
and at the time of its release i didn't have any rhythm hardware for my ps3 and was stuck

2462
02:09:55,640 --> 02:09:59,520
with a hard decision from all the reviews and talk about rock band 2 and guitar hero

2463
02:09:59,520 --> 02:10:04,320
4 it was quickly confirmed that the second hardware iteration from the makers of rock

2464
02:10:04,320 --> 02:10:09,260
band was superior one and the game was also thought to be better but with the release

2465
02:10:09,260 --> 02:10:14,000
of rock band 2 bundle in europe wasn't even sent while guitar hero 4 was due in just a

2466
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:17,880
few months now piracy wasn't an option since i needed the hardware and ended up buying

2467
02:10:17,880 --> 02:10:21,800
guitar hero 4 bundle to get the hardware and then bought rock band 2 disc which arrived

2468
02:10:21,800 --> 02:10:26,920
two weeks before guitar hero 4 as a side effect of this i now despise harmonix a bit for not

2469
02:10:26,920 --> 02:10:34,560
being able to ship hardware in a reasonable amount of time sorry drm now drm isn't different

2470
02:10:34,560 --> 02:10:39,160
for us europeans but it's still something to consider when buying a product even more

2471
02:10:39,160 --> 02:10:43,040
if you want to lend it to a friend install it several times just be able to play it without

2472
02:10:43,040 --> 02:10:48,520
an internet connection the worst drm i have to deal with on a daily basis is a cad computer

2473
02:10:48,520 --> 02:10:53,760
aided design program used for making mechanical parts and design requires not only a constant

2474
02:10:53,760 --> 02:10:59,320
online connection but also requires said connection to go through the school network um we're

2475
02:10:59,320 --> 02:11:03,820
using autocad interesting you know and we don't talk a lot about the the schemes used

2476
02:11:03,820 --> 02:11:10,040
in non-games well this means i have to run i have to vpn to the school network at all

2477
02:11:10,040 --> 02:11:14,080
times when using said software i can't even imagine how such extreme restrictions would

2478
02:11:14,080 --> 02:11:19,320
urge people to buy it when a pirated copy would mean a lot less hassle cost this is

2479
02:11:19,320 --> 02:11:23,360
one of the biggest hurdle for many people myself included and it goes a bit beyond what

2480
02:11:23,360 --> 02:11:27,800
americans have to go through from what i gather a new retail game over in the us cost about

2481
02:11:27,800 --> 02:11:36,320
60 which would be the equivalent of 450 swedish a swedish kroner however we have a value added

2482
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:40,680
tax for each and every item we purchase in stores where the rate for any item can be

2483
02:11:40,680 --> 02:11:46,520
6 12 or even 25 added to the price in short a video game costs a swedish person 600 kroners

2484
02:11:46,520 --> 02:11:52,000
which is the equivalent of 80 even if i know the tax goes to education government funding

2485
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:57,040
and health care it still leaves a big hole in my wallet every time i buy a video game

2486
02:11:57,040 --> 02:12:01,600
summary hopefully this letter gave you guys a better image of what gaming and the gamer

2487
02:12:01,600 --> 02:12:06,320
lifestyle is like across the sea even if we sometimes get treated as less as less important

2488
02:12:06,320 --> 02:12:10,800
market we still have to we still like to support our favorite developers and actually pay for

2489
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:15,040
games we enjoy if you have any more questions i'll be happy to answer them when i get the

2490
02:12:15,040 --> 02:12:19,960
time but for now i have to get back to studying jeditz out good luck with your exams by the

2491
02:12:19,960 --> 02:12:25,940
way yes good email um i i'm a little sad though that it didn't come from one of the countries

2492
02:12:25,940 --> 02:12:29,520
that was really high on the list because i don't recall sweden being in the top 10 well

2493
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:34,680
i do i do appreciate sweden very much without them we would not have abba but you know what

2496
02:12:43,200 --> 02:12:47,080
abba oh i haven't heard from him in a while i hope he's doing well i'm sure the challenge

2497
02:12:47,080 --> 02:12:50,480
for super mario galaxy 2 will be plentiful i noticed that the little starburst don't

2498
02:12:50,480 --> 02:12:58,360
say you're mr gay anymore now they say you're my gay that's almost sweet in its own way

02:15:05,600 --> 02:15:12,080
behind the other car that's in front of them preventing you from going around them because

2519
02:15:12,080 --> 02:15:16,640
they're douchebags not only that they kind of drive slow or take turns really wide or

2552
02:18:21,560 --> 02:18:25,920
a blue kind of like the ghosts in a weird way although i believe one of the ghosts is

2553
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:30,040
orange not yellow but still it's chasing a ghost but it did they are chasing a ghost

2554
02:18:30,040 --> 02:18:35,200
so maybe it's some type of multiplayer pac-man ce that seems to be the popular thought as

2555
02:18:35,200 --> 02:18:40,280
to what this is all about plus they are showing this at the amusement expo 2010 so the thought

2556
02:18:40,280 --> 02:18:47,960
is mm arcade game possibly yeah arcade games so that's always good news to know that new

2557
02:18:47,960 --> 02:18:51,560
arcade games are coming out because unfortunately it's a genre we don't hear enough of in this

2558
02:18:51,560 --> 02:18:57,360
day and age so there it is all right we're gonna go to the skype line right now at one

2566
02:19:32,480 --> 02:19:37,040
on the news lately because of an earthquake yes we've heard about it and where exactly

2567
02:19:37,040 --> 02:19:41,560
in chile are you i'm actually in santiago like in one of the major cities i was hit

2568
02:19:41,560 --> 02:19:46,640
by it wow are you but you're calling into the show so your internet's working i mean

2569
02:19:46,640 --> 02:19:51,440
is everything actually my my internet was working before my phone worked wow it's crazy

2570
02:19:51,440 --> 02:19:55,840
i don't understand how that happened the first thing i could do to tell like my mother in

2571
02:19:55,840 --> 02:20:01,040
argentina and like my friends and stuff that i was okay was through facebook wow weirdest

2572
02:20:01,040 --> 02:20:05,520
thing no no uh-oh this kind of leads into that whole talk we were having about social

2573
02:20:05,520 --> 02:20:08,760
networking did you hear that didn't i say that there are legitimate reasons and then

2574
02:20:08,760 --> 02:20:13,600
there's just the crap yes but it's it's it's still interesting in this context honestly

2575
02:20:13,600 --> 02:20:19,860
in that context the first click i did was to hit submit to say i'm okay the second click

2576
02:20:19,860 --> 02:20:26,680
was to join the i survived the earthquake group that's exactly what i did very nice

2577
02:20:26,680 --> 02:20:31,240
very nice well i'm i'm really glad to know you're doing okay and for any of our listeners

2578
02:20:31,240 --> 02:20:35,760
who might remember you from your previous phone calls um i'm i'm sure they're glad to

2579
02:20:35,760 --> 02:20:40,400
hear that you're okay too so yeah i'm assuming that's um vj ramen's idea that i that i call

2580
02:20:40,400 --> 02:20:44,200
in to let people know in case they hadn't heard but yeah no that's good to know are

2581
02:20:44,200 --> 02:20:47,800
you still doing a regular show i know you used to do the role-playing show but i think

2582
02:20:47,800 --> 02:20:53,520
you guys put that on hold right yeah well i moved here chile last year and uh i had

2583
02:20:53,520 --> 02:20:57,640
to put it on hold because of you know work and not knowing my schedule and stuff so i

2584
02:20:57,640 --> 02:21:02,640
put it i didn't put it on hold myself i gave the show like the reins of it to one of the

2585
02:21:02,640 --> 02:21:07,960
co-hosts and he decided to put it on hold and definitely so gotcha that's that but you

2586
02:21:07,960 --> 02:21:12,880
know i've been like uh about two weeks ago i was on a guest thing on video game news

2587
02:21:12,880 --> 02:21:17,920
radio oh fun so you know i was there if you care to listen to my musings but are those

2588
02:21:17,920 --> 02:21:22,800
the guys in cleveland or am i yeah they are they are okay oh wow okay cool yeah they're

2589
02:21:22,800 --> 02:21:26,240
the other guys that have been doing this a show forever like i think they've been on

2590
02:21:26,240 --> 02:21:29,720
about as long as we have this show as long as you guys have it's crazy that's cool yeah

2591
02:21:29,720 --> 02:21:33,640
it's a very different show than us it's it's more yeah you must have been calling in to

2592
02:21:33,640 --> 02:21:39,880
talk about uh like halo 3 or or some of the shooter games because they play or the call

2593
02:21:39,880 --> 02:21:44,840
of duty type stuff that's oh that's that's more the type of stuff they get into right

2594
02:21:44,840 --> 02:21:48,520
the best thing that they do is when they talk about nothing that's related to video games

2595
02:21:48,520 --> 02:21:53,000
honestly they just go on rants about how one of them is a trucker the other one is you

2596
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:57,360
know a part of a job and it's hilarious i don't know how interesting that uh that would

2597
02:21:57,360 --> 02:22:01,500
be the uh interesting part of their show too honestly they actually had a spin-off they

2598
02:22:01,500 --> 02:22:07,200
have a spin-off show uh that they called some midwest wasteland i believe the name and uh

2599
02:22:07,200 --> 02:22:10,080
that's all they talk about like they just said you know what we're gonna scrap the video

2600
02:22:10,080 --> 02:22:14,920
game part of it and just go with what people actually like so it's pretty funny it's interesting

2601
02:22:14,920 --> 02:22:19,240
you bring up spin-off shows because you know jamie was doing a comic podcast for a while

2602
02:22:19,240 --> 02:22:22,880
and i know she had to put that on hold but uh there might be other spin-off shows in

2603
02:22:22,880 --> 02:22:27,720
the works you never know what might be coming so stay tuned so uh yeah you know i just wanted

2604
02:22:27,720 --> 02:22:32,180
to call in about that uh i didn't get hurt more than you know you know scraps bruises

2605
02:22:32,180 --> 02:22:36,840
that kind of thing from you know moving debris and stuff because one of our walls actually

2606
02:22:36,840 --> 02:22:41,720
came down wow uh that separates our well like our house from the neighbors and it fell down

2607
02:22:41,720 --> 02:22:47,560
on our cars so so our cars are now like you know they're covering rubble and now they

2608
02:22:47,560 --> 02:22:51,480
need to be repaired and stuff i remember jamie had a wall fall on her car i was just about

2609
02:22:51,480 --> 02:22:56,960
to say yeah i remember that happening it was um at my old apartment complex we had uh this

2610
02:22:56,960 --> 02:23:04,120
sort of uh stucco and brick wall that was around uh the dumpster and we had that windstorm

2611
02:23:04,120 --> 02:23:09,720
and the wall actually fell over on the car right yeah and it just dented one ridge on

2612
02:23:09,720 --> 02:23:14,040
it from where it impacted thankfully the car was still drivable though it looked like like

2613
02:23:14,040 --> 02:23:20,840
a just a ugly thing but yeah that's a car it's here so the car is just a car it's replaced

2614
02:23:20,840 --> 02:23:24,280
yeah that's yeah that's the only thing i can be thankful of although i mean i don't know

2615
02:23:24,280 --> 02:23:28,280
you guys are in california so you kind of are used to like you know the earth shaking

2616
02:23:28,280 --> 02:23:34,000
i suppose the place we live is not nearly as bad with the earthquakes we've felt a few

2617
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:37,280
but they're usually not that bad but i do go to san francisco a lot and i have a lot

2618
02:23:37,280 --> 02:23:39,960
of friends over there you know and it's a little more it's a little more prevalent over

2619
02:23:39,960 --> 02:23:46,060
there um but it's just it's weird how many earthquakes there have been lately like in

2620
02:23:46,060 --> 02:23:51,600
the last two months there have been four major earthquakes haiti chile japan and taiwan and

2621
02:23:51,600 --> 02:23:55,860
there was all the same there was also a pretty big one in california on the north coast it

2622
02:23:55,860 --> 02:24:01,340
was off the coast but it was uh the out in the ocean by eureka like i remember it made

2623
02:24:01,340 --> 02:24:06,160
the news here it was it was above a six it's a pretty big deal yeah well actually we've

2624
02:24:06,160 --> 02:24:11,080
We've been having, you know, the earthquake itself here, where it hit here in Santiago

2625
02:24:11,080 --> 02:24:13,080
was about 7 point something.

2626
02:24:13,080 --> 02:24:17,480
It wasn't quite 8 and at the epicenter it was 8.8.

2627
02:24:17,480 --> 02:24:18,480
But we've been...

2628
02:24:18,480 --> 02:24:19,480
We've got 2012, 2012, 2012.

2629
02:24:19,480 --> 02:24:25,120
Yeah, if you look at the footage that you will see on TV, most likely from that place,

2630
02:24:25,120 --> 02:24:28,160
which is about 300 kilometers away from here.

2631
02:24:28,160 --> 02:24:30,600
But still, you know, in earthquake distances that's nothing.

2632
02:24:30,600 --> 02:24:32,780
Like it still hits pretty hard all around.

2633
02:24:32,780 --> 02:24:38,080
So, you know, it wasn't as bad as that, but still what's funny or not that funny actually

2634
02:24:38,080 --> 02:24:43,320
and that actually has me scared shitless lately is that every few hours there's going to be

2635
02:24:43,320 --> 02:24:44,320
an aftershock.

2636
02:24:44,320 --> 02:24:49,560
And those aftershocks can reach 6.1, 6.5 and all of a sudden you're just doing your things

2637
02:24:49,560 --> 02:24:51,240
and everything's just shaking again.

2638
02:24:51,240 --> 02:24:56,720
And you know, after we're waking up at 3.34 a.m. to an earthquake that, you know, fell

2639
02:24:56,720 --> 02:25:00,840
the wall on your car, you know, you get really nervous all the time.

2640
02:25:00,840 --> 02:25:04,600
Especially for me, this is my first major thing because I live in Argentina.

2641
02:25:04,600 --> 02:25:05,600
Nothing happens.

2642
02:25:05,600 --> 02:25:06,600
Like there's no earthquakes, no tornadoes.

2643
02:25:06,600 --> 02:25:09,440
Well, I heard they felt this one in Buenos Aires, so...

2644
02:25:09,440 --> 02:25:15,360
Yeah, yeah, but I've been in Buenos Aires when we quote unquote feel an earthquake and

2645
02:25:15,360 --> 02:25:18,360
it's like, oh, look, there's a wind gust.

2646
02:25:18,360 --> 02:25:19,840
And it's like it's nothing.

2647
02:25:19,840 --> 02:25:22,720
But like being here, I was honestly just...

2648
02:25:22,720 --> 02:25:24,520
I don't remember being afraid.

2649
02:25:24,520 --> 02:25:25,520
I don't remember anything.

2650
02:25:25,520 --> 02:25:31,680
I just remember like running away outside, away from trees and walls, just, you know.

2651
02:25:31,680 --> 02:25:36,240
Footy monster, just, you know, just do your best to be safe and, you know, don't live

2652
02:25:36,240 --> 02:25:41,360
in fear too bad because, you know, if it's your time, then lightning could strike you

2653
02:25:41,360 --> 02:25:43,360
when you're walking down the street, you know.

2654
02:25:43,360 --> 02:25:45,000
That's true.

2655
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:46,040
Anything could happen ever.

2656
02:25:46,040 --> 02:25:47,040
So don't live in fear.

2657
02:25:47,040 --> 02:25:48,120
But always have a plan.

2658
02:25:48,120 --> 02:25:51,840
And I think this is a good lesson for all the listeners.

2659
02:25:51,840 --> 02:25:55,200
You know, even though we're a video gaming podcast, this is still a good opportunity

2660
02:25:55,200 --> 02:26:00,120
to talk about, you know, if something bad happens, do you know what you would do?

2661
02:26:00,120 --> 02:26:03,760
Like for example, you listening to this show, bam, something's happening right now.

2662
02:26:03,760 --> 02:26:04,760
There's an emergency.

2663
02:26:04,760 --> 02:26:06,520
An earthquake happens where you are right now.

2664
02:26:06,520 --> 02:26:07,520
Do you know what you would do?

2665
02:26:07,520 --> 02:26:12,360
I have one piece of advice in regards to that because it's been baffling my mind what people

2666
02:26:12,360 --> 02:26:13,800
have been doing here.

2667
02:26:13,800 --> 02:26:17,880
If there's an earthquake going on, if there's some sort of natural disaster going around

2668
02:26:17,880 --> 02:26:20,360
you, don't grab your laptop.

2669
02:26:20,360 --> 02:26:22,080
Don't grab your DS.

2670
02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:23,080
Just get out.

2671
02:26:23,080 --> 02:26:24,080
Just go get...

2672
02:26:24,080 --> 02:26:25,080
Be safe.

2673
02:26:25,080 --> 02:26:27,600
Put your long shoes on because that's probably going to be dangerous if you're just walking

2674
02:26:27,600 --> 02:26:31,600
in a flooded place and, you know, try to get shoes at least.

2675
02:26:31,600 --> 02:26:34,400
But other than that, just get out and everything else is replaceable.

2676
02:26:34,400 --> 02:26:39,320
I've been looking at people ransacking like supermarkets and department stores and they're

2677
02:26:39,320 --> 02:26:44,440
taking LCDs with them when they don't even have a house anymore and then to feed themselves.

2678
02:26:44,440 --> 02:26:45,440
I don't even get it.

2679
02:26:45,440 --> 02:26:46,680
Like some people are stupid.

2680
02:26:46,680 --> 02:26:48,040
They react stupidly to this thing.

2681
02:26:48,040 --> 02:26:49,560
So that would be my advice.

2682
02:26:49,560 --> 02:26:50,560
Be smart.

2683
02:26:50,560 --> 02:26:51,920
Just be safe first.

2684
02:26:51,920 --> 02:26:53,520
Then worry about everything material.

2685
02:26:53,520 --> 02:26:57,920
That is some unfortunate but necessary advice, especially for a tech-savvy crowd.

2686
02:26:57,920 --> 02:27:01,360
Footy, I'm going to have to let you go to get some more calls, but stay safe, okay?

2687
02:27:01,360 --> 02:27:02,360
All right.

2688
02:27:02,360 --> 02:27:03,360
Thank you so much, guys.

2689
02:27:03,360 --> 02:27:04,360
We're all thinking of you.

2690
02:27:04,360 --> 02:27:05,360
Take care.

2691
02:27:05,360 --> 02:27:06,360
You too.

2692
02:27:06,360 --> 02:27:07,360
Bye.

2693
02:27:07,360 --> 02:27:08,360
Oof.

2694
02:27:08,360 --> 02:27:09,360
I hope that's the last of it.

2695
02:27:09,360 --> 02:27:10,360
I hope there's not another big earthquake coming.

2696
02:27:10,360 --> 02:27:11,360
Oh, boy.

2697
02:27:11,360 --> 02:27:12,360
Oh, boy.

2698
02:27:12,360 --> 02:27:13,360
All right.

2699
02:27:13,360 --> 02:27:14,960
Well, we still have time for some more calls.

02:27:19,360 --> 02:27:21,440
Tell some dick and fart jokes to kind of relieve the tension a little bit.

2704
02:27:21,440 --> 02:27:22,440
It'd be nice.

2705
02:27:22,440 --> 02:27:25,400
We're going to talk about the unicorn game with Loki because he will not stop playing

2706
02:27:25,400 --> 02:27:26,400
it over there.

2707
02:27:26,400 --> 02:27:27,400
I can't help it.

2708
02:27:27,400 --> 02:27:28,400
It's so addicting.

2709
02:27:28,400 --> 02:27:29,400
I just found something else disturbing.

2710
02:27:29,400 --> 02:27:30,400
Sure.

2711
02:27:30,400 --> 02:27:31,400
What's that?

2712
02:27:31,400 --> 02:27:32,800
The Wonder Twins are on Smallville now.

2713
02:27:32,800 --> 02:27:34,280
Goody, goody.

2714
02:27:34,280 --> 02:27:35,920
What's that mean?

2715
02:27:35,920 --> 02:27:37,480
Wonder Twin powers activated.

2716
02:27:37,480 --> 02:27:38,480
Oh, God.

2717
02:27:38,480 --> 02:27:39,480
Wow.

2718
02:27:39,480 --> 02:27:40,480
Amazing.

2719
02:27:40,480 --> 02:27:41,480
All right.

2720
02:27:41,480 --> 02:27:42,480
Let's go to the phones.

2721
02:27:42,480 --> 02:27:43,480
Hi.

2722
02:27:43,480 --> 02:27:44,480
You're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

2723
02:27:44,480 --> 02:27:45,480
Who's this?

2724
02:27:45,480 --> 02:27:46,480
Hey, it's Rama.

2725
02:27:46,480 --> 02:27:47,480
What's up, everyone?

2726
02:27:47,480 --> 02:27:48,480
Hey, Rama.

2727
02:27:48,480 --> 02:27:49,480
How are you doing?

2728
02:27:49,480 --> 02:27:50,480
We're good.

2729
02:27:50,480 --> 02:27:51,480
How are you?

2730
02:27:51,480 --> 02:27:52,480
I'm good.

2731
02:27:52,480 --> 02:27:53,480
A couple of things.

2732
02:27:53,480 --> 02:27:57,920
Well, I want a reference back to the beginning of the episode about how they're trying to

2733
02:27:57,920 --> 02:28:02,000
pass that little ban on swearing for a week.

2734
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:05,440
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, huh?

2735
02:28:05,440 --> 02:28:06,440
Yeah.

2736
02:28:06,440 --> 02:28:11,120
A few months ago, they tried to do the same thing here in New York, but they tried to

2737
02:28:11,120 --> 02:28:13,840
ban the N-word.

2738
02:28:13,840 --> 02:28:16,520
It didn't get that far.

2739
02:28:16,520 --> 02:28:21,280
You know, and free speech is free speech, so I wouldn't support that.

2740
02:28:21,280 --> 02:28:27,200
But there's a huge difference between the N-word and the F-word.

2741
02:28:27,200 --> 02:28:28,200
You know what I mean?

2742
02:28:28,200 --> 02:28:30,640
Yes, I do.

2743
02:28:30,640 --> 02:28:31,640
There's a huge difference.

2744
02:28:31,640 --> 02:28:35,520
I still think people just shouldn't say the N-word out of good taste.

2745
02:28:35,520 --> 02:28:40,880
Even if we were going to say, you know what, we're going to have our week where we're just

2746
02:28:40,880 --> 02:28:45,840
going to start swearing profusely in protest of this law, and we're going to say every

2747
02:28:45,840 --> 02:28:49,600
dirty word we can think of, and we're going to say fuck, shit, piss, so forth, I still

2748
02:28:49,600 --> 02:28:51,800
wouldn't say that word.

2749
02:28:51,800 --> 02:28:53,120
You know?

2750
02:28:53,120 --> 02:28:54,120
Of course.

2751
02:28:54,120 --> 02:28:59,440
I mean, there are times I find myself saying it by accident, or depending on the company

2752
02:28:59,440 --> 02:29:03,040
that I am with, you know?

2753
02:29:03,040 --> 02:29:06,840
But there are times I do find it a little bit offensive, but half the time I just don't

2754
02:29:06,840 --> 02:29:10,960
care, because it kind of falls into free speech, and it just doesn't bother me at all.

2755
02:29:10,960 --> 02:29:11,960
Right.

2756
02:29:11,960 --> 02:29:16,000
I'm like, you know, and I read a comment from the chatroom, GS68 says, wait, is it not being

2757
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,880
able to say the N-word censorship?

2758
02:29:18,880 --> 02:29:20,680
I guess, yeah, it is.

2759
02:29:20,680 --> 02:29:24,920
But my whole thought is that I just don't want to say that, because there's a big heavy

2760
02:29:24,920 --> 02:29:30,280
weight that comes with saying that word, and a lot of responsibility, like, you know, and

2761
02:29:30,280 --> 02:29:33,120
it's one of those don't write checks your ass can't cash kind of thing.

2762
02:29:33,120 --> 02:29:34,240
Does that make sense?

2763
02:29:34,240 --> 02:29:35,240
You know?

2764
02:29:35,240 --> 02:29:38,980
So if you're going to say a word like that, you better be prepared for the social repercussions

2765
02:29:38,980 --> 02:29:46,960
that come with a very, what's the word I'm looking for, a very emotion-inducing word.

2766
02:29:46,960 --> 02:29:51,760
Well, Chris Rocks, though, said that if it's Christmas Eve, and someone beats you in the

2767
02:29:51,760 --> 02:29:56,000
head when you're trying to buy the last Barbie doll, that you can call them that for, like,

2768
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:57,000
45 minutes.

2769
02:29:57,000 --> 02:30:02,040
Yeah, at four o'clock in the morning, within a two-block radius, yeah.

2770
02:30:02,040 --> 02:30:03,880
And you have to show your receipt.

2771
02:30:03,880 --> 02:30:04,880
Uh-huh.

2772
02:30:04,880 --> 02:30:09,920
Yeah, I actually listened to that very recently, that was funny.

2773
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:16,440
Excellent from Kitsune in chat, saying the N-word is disrespectful, saying fuck is not,

2774
02:30:16,440 --> 02:30:18,280
unless you call someone a fucker.

2775
02:30:18,280 --> 02:30:21,000
But I call people fucker all the time, I call my husband fucker.

2776
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:24,640
I call people fuckers and motherfuckers all the time, and sometimes it's a term of endearment,

2777
02:30:24,640 --> 02:30:25,640
like bitch.

2778
02:30:25,640 --> 02:30:31,360
Like, God, Jamie, you're such a bitch, but I mean that in positive, you know?

2779
02:30:31,360 --> 02:30:36,760
Back when I was hanging out with a certain somebody, we used to, we actually had a whole

2780
02:30:36,760 --> 02:30:40,800
conversation about that, about how the only people who could use those particular terms

2781
02:30:40,800 --> 02:30:46,600
of the people are the ones that applied to, you know, contextually, you know, and they

2782
02:30:46,600 --> 02:30:49,560
even had a mention of that in the Hebrew Hammer, I thought was absolutely hilarious.

2783
02:30:49,560 --> 02:30:57,000
Um, but, uh, so we used to go around, you know, calling each other, I guess, the H-word.

2784
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:58,000
I'm gonna say it.

2785
02:30:58,000 --> 02:30:59,000
Honky.

2786
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:00,000
Oh, okay.

2787
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:01,000
I was gonna say, what pray tell is the H-word?

2788
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:02,000
Okay.

2789
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:03,000
You know, cracker and everything.

2790
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:04,000
Yeah, yeah.

2791
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:07,000
You know, because it was like, okay, well, so they can do it, why can't we?

2792
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:12,360
So we had that conversation, so we just started going around doing it, you know, as, as a

2793
02:31:12,360 --> 02:31:19,000
point of order, you know, it's not, it's not supposed to be insulting when you're the one

2794
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:20,000
doing it.

2795
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:24,120
When it's, it's sort of like you taking it and turning it around.

2796
02:31:24,120 --> 02:31:28,200
At the same time, you know, if someone else came and said that, it'd be like, oh, insult,

2797
02:31:28,200 --> 02:31:29,200
blah, blah, blah.

2798
02:31:29,200 --> 02:31:33,920
You know, but, you know, I, I could go on a whole rant about this.

2799
02:31:33,920 --> 02:31:34,920
I believe it.

2800
02:31:34,920 --> 02:31:37,360
And we'll tie this into video games because you might be sitting there going, what is

2801
02:31:37,360 --> 02:31:40,480
this discussion on language and words have to do with video games?

2802
02:31:40,480 --> 02:31:46,680
Sign on to Xbox Live and play any popular multiplayer game on Xbox Live and you will

2803
02:31:46,680 --> 02:31:51,200
see why this discussion is important because that whole spiel I said about don't write

2804
02:31:51,200 --> 02:31:54,520
checks your ass can't cash when it comes to saying some things.

2805
02:31:54,520 --> 02:31:55,520
Yeah.

2806
02:31:55,520 --> 02:32:01,540
Like some people like to, or love to hide behind that anonymity on Xbox Live and just

2807
02:32:01,540 --> 02:32:06,520
write checks left and right that are going to bounce if you know what I mean.

2808
02:32:06,520 --> 02:32:07,520
Wow.

2809
02:32:07,520 --> 02:32:13,080
So anyhow, Rama, after such a deep conversation, do you have a dick and fart joke or at least

2810
02:32:13,080 --> 02:32:16,800
a video game you've been playing lately?

2811
02:32:16,800 --> 02:32:20,760
Video game, but before I get into it, I just want to know, did you hear me on my keyword?

2812
02:32:20,760 --> 02:32:21,760
No.

2813
02:32:21,760 --> 02:32:22,760
Okay, good.

2814
02:32:22,760 --> 02:32:23,760
Okay.

2815
02:32:23,760 --> 02:32:26,480
Um, no, you're fine.

2816
02:32:26,480 --> 02:32:29,120
I downloaded Blaster Master Overdrive.

2817
02:32:29,120 --> 02:32:30,840
Ah, yes, yes.

2818
02:32:30,840 --> 02:32:32,360
I talked about this a couple of weeks ago.

2819
02:32:32,360 --> 02:32:33,440
What did you think?

2820
02:32:33,440 --> 02:32:34,800
I really liked it.

2821
02:32:34,800 --> 02:32:37,800
Um, my roommate, he's, he's played it.

2822
02:32:37,800 --> 02:32:43,000
He, his main gripe is the fact that in the original NES version, you could jump higher

2823
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,920
with Sophia.

2824
02:32:45,920 --> 02:32:49,140
I didn't even catch that difference, but that's a good one.

2825
02:32:49,140 --> 02:32:50,140
He caught that.

2826
02:32:50,140 --> 02:32:51,960
The controls were what pissed me off.

2827
02:32:51,960 --> 02:32:53,960
That whole straight with the button.

2828
02:32:53,960 --> 02:32:54,960
Ugh.

2829
02:32:54,960 --> 02:32:55,960
Yuck.

2830
02:32:55,960 --> 02:32:58,720
So, but otherwise you liked it?

2831
02:32:58,720 --> 02:33:00,280
Classic controller right there, you know?

2832
02:33:00,280 --> 02:33:01,280
Yeah.

2833
02:33:01,280 --> 02:33:02,280
They needed the classic controller.

2834
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:06,560
It's just, there were these few little imperfections with the game that needed to be fixed.

2835
02:33:06,560 --> 02:33:09,000
You know what I mean?

2836
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:12,080
But the fact of the matter is we have a sequel.

2837
02:33:12,080 --> 02:33:15,320
I think we're kind of more excited about that than anything else.

2838
02:33:15,320 --> 02:33:16,320
That's true.

2839
02:33:16,320 --> 02:33:17,320
At least it happened.

2840
02:33:17,320 --> 02:33:18,320
Better than nothing.

2841
02:33:18,320 --> 02:33:20,360
All right, Rama, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you

2842
02:33:20,360 --> 02:33:21,360
so much.

2843
02:33:21,360 --> 02:33:22,360
Okay.

2844
02:33:22,360 --> 02:33:23,360
No problem.

2845
02:33:23,360 --> 02:33:24,360
And have fun with Blaster Master and the remixed music.

2846
02:33:24,360 --> 02:33:25,360
That's pretty good.

2847
02:33:25,360 --> 02:33:26,360
All right.

2848
02:33:26,360 --> 02:33:27,360
Later.

2849
02:33:27,360 --> 02:33:28,840
Um, we can probably squeeze in one more call.

2850
02:33:28,840 --> 02:33:32,840
I need to go to Loki though if he's taking a break from the unicorn game and see if there's

2851
02:33:32,840 --> 02:33:33,840
any last minute stories.

2852
02:33:33,840 --> 02:33:34,840
Jamie too, if she has anything.

2853
02:33:34,840 --> 02:33:36,840
No, I'm ranting in the chat room.

2854
02:33:36,840 --> 02:33:37,840
Really?

2855
02:33:37,840 --> 02:33:38,840
Yep.

2856
02:33:38,840 --> 02:33:39,840
Okay.

2857
02:33:39,840 --> 02:33:42,600
Apparently the SRB has revealed yet another Lips game on the way.

2858
02:33:42,600 --> 02:33:49,000
Apparently it's called I Heart the 80s and it will feature such songs including, let's

2859
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:50,000
see here.

2860
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:55,560
That doesn't really say, but they say some of the songs, of course, or lyrics that are

2861
02:33:55,560 --> 02:33:56,560
in there.

2862
02:33:56,560 --> 02:33:57,560
She's a very kinky girl.

2863
02:33:57,560 --> 02:33:59,120
I really need to love.

2864
02:33:59,120 --> 02:34:04,320
I really love to taste her and you don't have to sell your body to the night.

2865
02:34:04,320 --> 02:34:06,200
So I don't even recognize those songs.

2866
02:34:06,200 --> 02:34:08,920
I recognize that she's a very kinky girl.

2867
02:34:08,920 --> 02:34:11,000
I do recognize that one.

2868
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:12,000
That one I recognize.

2869
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:13,800
Let's take a quick call.

2870
02:34:13,800 --> 02:34:14,800
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

2871
02:34:14,800 --> 02:34:15,800
Who's this?

2872
02:34:15,800 --> 02:34:17,120
Good evening.

2873
02:34:17,120 --> 02:34:20,920
You crossed the, uh, supposed like, Oh, what the fuck?

2874
02:34:20,920 --> 02:34:21,920
I'm lost.

2875
02:34:21,920 --> 02:34:22,920
It anyway.

2876
02:34:22,920 --> 02:34:23,920
Hello there.

2877
02:34:23,920 --> 02:34:24,920
Oh Lord.

2878
02:34:24,920 --> 02:34:25,920
This is my kid.

2879
02:34:25,920 --> 02:34:26,920
Hello.

2880
02:34:26,920 --> 02:34:27,920
Hi.

2881
02:34:27,920 --> 02:34:28,920
How are you doing?

2882
02:34:28,920 --> 02:34:29,920
I'm doing just fine.

2883
02:34:29,920 --> 02:34:33,320
Now, what do you think about this whole fact that now we have like a second Swedish listener?

2884
02:34:33,320 --> 02:34:34,800
Are you okay with that?

2885
02:34:34,800 --> 02:34:35,800
What?

2886
02:34:35,800 --> 02:34:36,800
Yeah.

2887
02:34:36,800 --> 02:34:38,800
Did you hear that?

2888
02:34:38,800 --> 02:34:40,840
He called in a couple of weeks ago too.

2889
02:34:40,840 --> 02:34:42,880
We have another guy in Sweden who listens.

2890
02:34:42,880 --> 02:34:44,440
Oh damn.

2891
02:34:44,440 --> 02:34:45,440
Of course.

2892
02:34:45,440 --> 02:34:46,440
I know Sweden's a big place.

2893
02:34:46,440 --> 02:34:47,440
I'd be all like, do you guys know each other?

2894
02:34:47,440 --> 02:34:50,600
But you know, that would be like a little silly because that's like when people ask

2895
02:34:50,600 --> 02:34:55,040
me if I see celebrities, cause I live in California when LA is like eight hours away from here.

2896
02:34:55,040 --> 02:34:58,480
And even when you're in LA, you don't really see celebrities cause celebrities don't really

2897
02:34:58,480 --> 02:35:04,800
like to, you know, they don't really go out in public and shop at, you know, Vons often,

2898
02:35:04,800 --> 02:35:07,160
you know, it's, it's, it's different.

2899
02:35:07,160 --> 02:35:08,800
But anyway, what's on your mind?

2900
02:35:08,800 --> 02:35:09,800
I'm sorry.

2901
02:35:09,800 --> 02:35:10,800
I didn't mean to get on the tangent there.

2902
02:35:10,800 --> 02:35:16,960
Uh, well, what was I gonna, well, I have a question for Jamie actually since, well, uh,

2903
02:35:16,960 --> 02:35:24,880
how would you, if someone, if a Sims 3 player that plays Sims 3 quite a bit would actually

2904
02:35:24,880 --> 02:35:29,280
attempt to try to play Sims 2, how would that feel?

2905
02:35:29,280 --> 02:35:32,000
Wait, wait, wait, say that.

2906
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:33,000
Taking a step backwards.

2907
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:40,120
I think like if you're a Sims 3 fan, I've gone back and played Sims 2 and it was fun

2908
02:35:40,120 --> 02:35:44,520
picking up my old games cause there's actually, um, because the mod community, you know, there's

2909
02:35:44,520 --> 02:35:47,720
so much more out for Sims 2, I could do a whole lot more in my games.

2910
02:35:47,720 --> 02:35:50,760
I really enjoy going back to Sims 2 every so often.

2911
02:35:50,760 --> 02:35:55,560
But I, I, I'm, wait Sims 3 is catching up.

2912
02:35:55,560 --> 02:36:03,320
So yeah, well, yeah, because, well, the, because I have been, because the most accurate, the

2913
02:36:03,320 --> 02:36:09,800
most fun I'm having is that since I have the expansion, since I have the World Adventures

2914
02:36:09,800 --> 02:36:19,200
expansion, I have this, I, I, I like having my Sims doing like doing the spar part against

2915
02:36:19,200 --> 02:36:24,280
each other because like the kung fu part is like way entertaining actually.

2916
02:36:24,280 --> 02:36:28,880
I just have to share, I'm looking over at DarkSakra's desk and World Adventures is sitting

2917
02:36:28,880 --> 02:36:33,240
right on the desk under, under one of her knitting projects right there and then high

2918
02:36:33,240 --> 02:36:35,000
end loft stuff is right there too.

2919
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:36,440
Yep, I just got them together.

2920
02:36:36,440 --> 02:36:37,440
Wow.

2921
02:36:37,440 --> 02:36:38,440
It's, I need to re-install everything.

2922
02:36:38,440 --> 02:36:41,440
It's just funny you brought it up cause they're sitting on her desk right now.

2923
02:36:41,440 --> 02:36:44,120
I'll take a picture.

2924
02:36:44,120 --> 02:36:50,920
Speaking of high end, high end loft stuff, do you think it's worth it?

2925
02:36:50,920 --> 02:36:51,920
They're worth it.

2926
02:36:51,920 --> 02:36:59,240
Because I, the problem myself is that, well, because I was found like cheap, found like

2927
02:36:59,240 --> 02:37:10,360
cheap Sims 2, Sims 2 game was that I found like, like the original Sims 2 and a few expansions.

2928
02:37:10,360 --> 02:37:25,840
The expansions for the second part is the animal thing, whatever, the pets and the travel

2929
02:37:25,840 --> 02:37:38,080
parts and the supposed annoying thing is that, well, the expansions in Sims 2 that I'm interested

2930
02:37:38,080 --> 02:37:41,000
of I don't have yet.

2931
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:53,120
Since the expansions that I'm interested in are the year round, the seasons and free time

2932
02:37:53,120 --> 02:38:03,000
because well, at the current, my Sims 3 game I find is a bit boring, but in a way kind

2933
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:12,000
of funny since, well, I like to have my, have my, have my Sims sleeping outside.

2934
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:16,520
Like with, yeah, well I know that for world adventures you've got the tents and everything.

2935
02:38:16,520 --> 02:38:22,320
To be honest, my whole thing with, with Sims 2 was really just building houses, which is

2936
02:38:22,320 --> 02:38:25,220
the same thing I do in Sims 3.

2937
02:38:25,220 --> 02:38:27,160
I love building houses.

2938
02:38:27,160 --> 02:38:29,920
So that's really all I do in it, is just build houses.

2939
02:38:29,920 --> 02:38:31,200
Oh well.

2940
02:38:31,200 --> 02:38:36,680
But I do, if you were looking, if you don't want to pay for, you know, like the high end

2941
02:38:36,680 --> 02:38:40,560
loft stuff, because I mean, I got it because, you know, it was 20 bucks.

2942
02:38:40,560 --> 02:38:41,560
I was there.

2943
02:38:41,560 --> 02:38:43,240
I had the money to blow.

2944
02:38:43,240 --> 02:38:44,760
That's why I got it.

2945
02:38:44,760 --> 02:38:52,360
But if you go to mod the Sims or the Sims resource, you can get all kinds of stuff.

2946
02:38:52,360 --> 02:38:56,640
And if you, you know, if you sort right, you know, for which expansions that you have,

2947
02:38:56,640 --> 02:39:02,000
you can get all kinds of, of just really cool stuff that's all made by, you know, user made

2948
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:03,000
content.

2949
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:07,280
Yeah, but here's the other thing, I don't even know if you can tell me, but I, the only

2950
02:39:07,280 --> 02:39:12,220
thing I want to know in any kind of way is that, well, are there, are the stuff that's

2951
02:39:12,220 --> 02:39:21,360
included in high end loft stuff, are there better, actually a point better than things

2952
02:39:21,360 --> 02:39:27,000
in the original, things that you get, that you get in the expansion or the original game?

2953
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:30,080
Well, I haven't actually got it to run yet.

2954
02:39:30,080 --> 02:39:31,080
Okay.

2955
02:39:31,080 --> 02:39:35,520
Yeah, mine froze, I think because of all the mods I have already installed, because I have

2956
02:39:35,520 --> 02:39:41,120
like the no blur mod, you know, so you can actually see them naked.

2957
02:39:41,120 --> 02:39:44,680
I hate the blur, it just annoys me.

2958
02:39:44,680 --> 02:39:51,000
And I have like, you know, a couple of slider hacks so that I can, you know, change different

2959
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:56,160
parts of the body and I think I might have to reinstall everything to get my games to

2960
02:39:56,160 --> 02:39:57,160
play.

2961
02:39:57,160 --> 02:40:03,560
Well, I have, and I can't, I can't say anything on that because I have, I'm using no mods

2962
02:40:03,560 --> 02:40:07,360
at all, unfortunately.

2963
02:40:07,360 --> 02:40:08,360
So I will.

2964
02:40:08,360 --> 02:40:11,320
Well, maybe she'll, she'll have a better answer for that component in a couple of weeks when

2965
02:40:11,320 --> 02:40:13,960
she gets all that fixed, but kind of going back to the original question, I think that

2966
02:40:13,960 --> 02:40:19,040
the best point that was made by, by Jamie there was the whole point about that if there's

2967
02:40:19,040 --> 02:40:22,600
something you want to go back and kind of experience that was in too, especially with

2968
02:40:22,600 --> 02:40:25,880
all the mods that were done for it and probably a bunch of scenarios that exist out there

2969
02:40:25,880 --> 02:40:28,640
on the internet and so forth, that's really the best way to do it.

2970
02:40:28,640 --> 02:40:30,440
And the fact it's, it's dirt cheap now.

2971
02:40:30,440 --> 02:40:31,440
Yeah.

2972
02:40:31,440 --> 02:40:36,000
You can get the whole Sims Uber collections gotta be really affordable at this point,

2973
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:37,000
right?

2974
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:38,000
I think so.

2975
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,960
I mean, you probably get like, I think they do like whole box sets now, but Aki ripper,

2976
02:40:40,960 --> 02:40:44,640
I say, take it to the extreme, go all the way back and play Sims one.

2977
02:40:44,640 --> 02:40:45,640
Oh no.

2978
02:40:45,640 --> 02:40:52,840
Uh, and I don't think that's possible with my computer since I'm running, uh, running

2979
02:40:52,840 --> 02:40:57,200
64, 64 bits, uh, seven windows seven at the moment.

2980
02:40:57,200 --> 02:40:59,240
So I don't think that's possible.

2981
02:40:59,240 --> 02:41:00,240
All right.

2982
02:41:00,240 --> 02:41:03,080
I can remember we got to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much for

2983
02:41:03,080 --> 02:41:04,080
the call.

2984
02:41:04,080 --> 02:41:05,080
Okay, buddy.

2985
02:41:05,080 --> 02:41:06,080
Oh, later.

2986
02:41:06,080 --> 02:41:07,080
Have fun simming.

2987
02:41:07,080 --> 02:41:08,080
All right.

2988
02:41:08,080 --> 02:41:09,360
Thanks so much guys for the calls tonight.

2989
02:41:09,360 --> 02:41:11,080
Apologies to those that didn't get through.

2990
02:41:11,080 --> 02:41:13,120
Uh, we had a lot of stuff going on tonight though.

2991
02:41:13,120 --> 02:41:17,040
So, uh, again, you can always send us an email and tweets and all that good stuff.

2992
02:41:17,040 --> 02:41:18,040
Please do.

2993
02:41:18,040 --> 02:41:19,480
Uh, many ways to interact with orange launch radio.

2994
02:41:19,480 --> 02:41:20,840
We always appreciate it.

2995
02:41:20,840 --> 02:41:21,840
All right.

2996
02:41:21,840 --> 02:41:24,520
Let's go around and, uh, wrap up any other last minute stories.

2997
02:41:24,520 --> 02:41:26,440
I cut Loki off for that call.

2998
02:41:26,440 --> 02:41:27,440
That's all right.

2999
02:41:27,440 --> 02:41:28,440
Uh, pump it up.

3000
02:41:28,440 --> 02:41:31,800
Fiesta has been unveiled to be coming out March, 2010.

3001
02:41:31,800 --> 02:41:36,800
This is the brand new, um, upgrade for pump it up.

3002
02:41:36,800 --> 02:41:40,320
This would happen to some of the folks behind in the groove are now with like the pump it

3003
02:41:40,320 --> 02:41:41,320
up folks.

3004
02:41:41,320 --> 02:41:42,320
I don't know.

3005
02:41:42,320 --> 02:41:44,400
That's what I thought happened.

3006
02:41:44,400 --> 02:41:50,640
Apparently though, uh, uh, Fiesta will, um, strengthen the intermediate steps for a pump

3007
02:41:50,640 --> 02:41:55,280
lovers, uh, mania and newly improved easy steps for beginners.

3008
02:41:55,280 --> 02:41:59,120
Players also have the option of versus mode in Fiesta.

3009
02:41:59,120 --> 02:42:04,600
Uh, let's see, uh, separated interfaces to better accommodate general players and pump

3010
02:42:04,600 --> 02:42:06,620
lovers from the start.

3011
02:42:06,620 --> 02:42:10,280
Users can play one of the custom made steps by using a USB.

3012
02:42:10,280 --> 02:42:13,060
So custom sets, kind of cool.

3013
02:42:13,060 --> 02:42:19,260
And uh, this is compatible with both a personal USB and pump USB, whatever that I imagine

3014
02:42:19,260 --> 02:42:20,840
they're all about the same anyways.

3015
02:42:20,840 --> 02:42:22,600
Go have a Fiesta with pump it up Fiesta.

3016
02:42:22,600 --> 02:42:26,160
They do have a partial song list out of Siesta.

3017
02:42:26,160 --> 02:42:30,040
I'm trying to see if there's anything other than Banya stuff on here.

3018
02:42:30,040 --> 02:42:37,440
Uh, Oh, good old Banya tons of Banya, uh, Banya production stuff.

3019
02:42:37,440 --> 02:42:42,760
They did a remake of a Turkey March, I guess Turkey that's been in, that's been in pump

3020
02:42:42,760 --> 02:42:43,760
forever.

3021
02:42:43,760 --> 02:42:44,760
Yeah.

3022
02:42:44,760 --> 02:42:48,360
Uh, a lot of remakes and remixes in there.

3023
02:42:48,360 --> 02:42:49,360
That's kinda cool.

3024
02:42:49,360 --> 02:42:51,840
Um, all right.

3025
02:42:51,840 --> 02:42:53,760
And I'm getting corrected in chat.

3026
02:42:53,760 --> 02:42:54,760
That's pump it up.

3027
02:42:54,760 --> 02:43:00,800
Pro says AJ mix and a Y Y R says pump it pro two is not the same thing as Fiesta.

3028
02:43:00,800 --> 02:43:02,840
So I guess there's two different pumps series.

3029
02:43:02,840 --> 02:43:03,840
Okay.

3030
02:43:03,840 --> 02:43:04,840
I kind of lost track.

3031
02:43:04,840 --> 02:43:05,840
Sorry guys.

3032
02:43:05,840 --> 02:43:07,680
Let's go, Oh, he, he, it's the five panel game.

3033
02:43:07,680 --> 02:43:09,800
I that's, that's how much I know of pump.

3034
02:43:09,800 --> 02:43:10,800
Sorry.

3035
02:43:10,800 --> 02:43:11,800
No offense to the community.

3036
02:43:11,800 --> 02:43:16,320
Even though the game just came out last week, a new line cinema has a option, the rights

3037
02:43:16,320 --> 02:43:21,040
for the film adaptation of heavy rain, even though the game plays out pretty much like

3038
02:43:21,040 --> 02:43:31,160
a film anyways, I guess I could see that, uh, and then that's pretty much all I wanted

3039
02:43:31,160 --> 02:43:32,160
to talk about.

3040
02:43:32,160 --> 02:43:33,160
All right.

3041
02:43:33,160 --> 02:43:37,960
Well, that's going to bring us to the close of a show, but not until we go around and

3042
02:43:37,960 --> 02:43:39,240
get everybody's final thought.

3043
02:43:39,240 --> 02:43:43,280
But first let me say a big thank you to everybody of course, for tuning in and supporting orange

3044
02:43:43,280 --> 02:43:45,600
lounge radio and supporting independent podcasting.

3045
02:43:45,600 --> 02:43:48,120
Um, you know, we don't really make any money off the show.

3046
02:43:48,120 --> 02:43:49,320
In fact, we pay to do it.

3047
02:43:49,320 --> 02:43:52,760
Uh, so we do really appreciate all you guys who help us spread the word.

3048
02:43:52,760 --> 02:43:56,240
All we ask, just tell, you know, one or two people about the show and help us spread the

3049
02:43:56,240 --> 02:43:57,240
word.

3050
02:43:57,240 --> 02:44:00,800
And of course we always do love, love, uh, when people post kind reviews of us out on

3051
02:44:00,800 --> 02:44:07,320
the internet, whether it be on, um, uh, iTunes or whether it be on, you know, what are the

3052
02:44:07,320 --> 02:44:10,640
other big sites that are out there, podcast alley or what have you, wherever you choose

3053
02:44:10,640 --> 02:44:11,640
to post it.

3054
02:44:11,640 --> 02:44:12,640
We really appreciate it.

3055
02:44:12,640 --> 02:44:15,760
So thank you guys so much for all the kind words about us on the internet.

3056
02:44:15,760 --> 02:44:16,760
Okay.

3057
02:44:16,760 --> 02:44:18,280
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

3058
02:44:18,280 --> 02:44:19,760
We'll start with a Loki tonight.

3059
02:44:19,760 --> 02:44:21,560
Loki, what's your final thought.

3060
02:44:21,560 --> 02:44:27,520
I can't wait to go home and install hyper spin 1.0 into my cabinets and finally drop

3061
02:44:27,520 --> 02:44:31,520
down that list of games so I can actually play some stuff.

3062
02:44:31,520 --> 02:44:34,000
My final thought is itchy.

3063
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:35,000
Yes.

3064
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:36,000
Dark Sakura.

3065
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:37,000
Tasty.

3066
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
That's your final thought?

3067
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:40,000
Tasty.

3068
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:41,000
You said itchy.

3069
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:42,000
I said tasty.

3070
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:43,000
All right.

3071
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:44,000
There you go.

3072
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:45,000
Itchy and scratchy.

3073
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:46,000
I know.

3074
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:47,000
I know.

3075
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:48,000
I know.

3076
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:49,000
I know.

3077
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:50,000
And Jill.

3078
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:51,000
Yeah, I get it.

3079
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:52,000
You don't want to end up a Jill sandwich.

3080
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:53,000
Anyhow.

3081
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:54,000
Thank you guys so much.

3082
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,520
Uh, we'll be back here next week to do it all again.

3083
02:44:56,520 --> 02:45:00,860
