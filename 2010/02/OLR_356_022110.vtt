Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
Here's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Lowkey

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, February 21st, 2010, Nintendo hits Australian piracy again,

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
EA is going to shut down more servers, and a recent HD fighting game is being ported to the iPhone.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Hello my friends on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio,

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
the video game podcast where every gamer has a voice.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
We are live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
Thanks to the folks at All Games Radio for letting us steal their bandwidth

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
every week right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, live on Sunday nights.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
With me is always say hello to my one and only co-host, DarkSakura.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
One and only?

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Well, you know, one and only sidekick.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
I don't know, because I always introduce Lowkey as tech master Lowkey.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
He's still a co-host, but that's just the way it is.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
You made him spit out his chicken.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
I'm sorry. Lowkey knows I love him.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Not in a, you know, no homo.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Isn't that what the rappers say now?

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
I think I was seeing something the other day where, I don't know, some rappers were talking about,

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
you know, yeah, yeah, you look really good in that outfit. No homo.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
Although I am a homo if you haven't already heard, so whatever.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
This show's off to a very strange start already tonight.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
It's not just the bandwidth issues, is it?

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Yeah.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
So anyway, how you doing, DarkSakura?

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
I'm doing.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
All right.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
And of course, the one and only tech master Lowkey is here as well.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Hello.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
How you doing, Lowkey?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Good.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
All right.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
So we're gonna be talking video games, of course, over the next few hours with you guys

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
at our chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
And I want to apologize in advance.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
Live radio tonight, I don't know what's going on.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
We're having some bandwidth issues in all games, and I think it's kind of why we're off.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
It's not all games' fault, though.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
They're perfect, because Bobby had a flawless show.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
But it's something to do, I think, with Comcast somewhere.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
So we're actually starting at 6.15 tonight to give you an idea of how many internet issues we have.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
But that's the joy of doing live radio.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
I gotta say, there's not a lot of podcasts out there that do it live.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
You know, obviously there are several.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
But there's not a lot that do the phone calls and all that other stuff.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
And that's just part of the fun of it.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
You know, I think it's the best way to make sure that every gamer has a voice.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
So you have to take the bad with the good, and sometimes there's gonna be bandwidth issues.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
All right.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
So we also have a special guest here in the studio tonight.

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
And it's not often we get guests at Studio Dark Sakura, besides Shermy, of course.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
But sometimes you have Dan, and I know Tiara's been here before as well.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
But tonight we have another special guest.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
Say hello, everybody, to Salacious Pop.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Hello.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
How are you?

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
I'm good. How are you?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Good.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
Now, it's funny that I was talking about No Homo earlier, because Salacious Pop happens

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
to be my boyfriend.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
That's right.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
I brought my boyfriend to the show tonight.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
So how are you?

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
I'm great.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Yes.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
So tell the listeners a little bit about yourself and video games, like what you're into.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Like, what kind of video games do you play?

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Without telling us about your gaming week, what would you say would be your favorite

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
video game and the types of stuff you're into?

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
Music and rhythm games, RPGs, and adventure games.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Yeah?

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
And what would you say is, like, your favorite video game ever?

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Valkyrie Profile.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Yeah?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Why?

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
The art direction, the story, the multiple endings, and the music.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Gotcha.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
What was, like, kind of, how did you get into video games?

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Did you get into video games when you were, like, older?

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
Or was it something you've, like, had a controller in your hand since you were born?

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Or what?

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
I think I got an Atari 2600 when I was about six or seven years old.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
And from there I graduated up to the NES and Super NES and played all these Sierra Online

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
games and that was it.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Very cool.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
And, of course, the chat room's chiming in here.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Leachum6 in chat says, does that mean plus homo?

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
I guess.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
I don't know.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Whatever.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
We're just, you know what, we like video games.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
That's the important thing here.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
So, yeah, we're going to talk about video games over the next few hours and the latest

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
that's going on in video games and news and everything.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
I don't know what it is.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Tonight is just an off night.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
I don't know if it's, like, the bandwidth or what, but I just feel kind of off and it

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
has nothing to do with Alan being here.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Or maybe I'm cracking under the pressure.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
I don't know.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Is it different being here?

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Because you've listened to the show before, obviously, right?

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
You've commented in chat.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Is it different being here in studio than it is listening?

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Absolutely.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
How is it different?

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Because I'm on live radio.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Because you're on live radio?

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Because you get in the middle of the chicken.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
And I'm nervous.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
You're nervous?

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Don't be nervous.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
It's fine.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
We've gotten away with this crap for some reason.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Dan's in the other room.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
I'm nervous.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Yeah.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
All right.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Well, don't be nervous.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
And even Loki.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Loki seems a little off tonight, too.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
What's going on, Loki?

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Because I asked Loki a question earlier.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
He has malaria.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
He got a little bitchy with me.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Loki's not usually the bitchy one.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Dark soccer.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
She's the bitchy one.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Loki.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
I didn't get bitchy.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
I was joking.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
You were a little bitchy.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
I was joking.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Oh, okay.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
Yeah, that's what I tell Dan once a month.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
She's like, well, someone didn't give me the stories that I put in there.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
I'm like, well, that's too bad.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
But here's the thing.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Here's the thing.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
It was funny.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Here's the thing the listeners have to know.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
Loki, although I know he kind of gets branded as the angry one on the show, because he does

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
his little rants when it's appropriate.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
And he's the angry guy on the show.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
He's actually, if you meet him in real life, he's one of the nicest people you'll ever

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
meet.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Seriously.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
I really mean that.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Loki goes out of his way to help people.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.320
He's that guy you can call when your computer's broken or that tech guy everybody knows that

05:27.320 --> 05:28.320
you can call, right?

05:28.320 --> 05:29.320
I'm the angry one.

05:29.320 --> 05:30.320
Yeah.

05:30.320 --> 05:31.320
And Jamie's usually the angry one.

05:31.320 --> 05:40.240
But tonight is weird because Loki was kind of like, well, I don't know, too bad.

05:40.240 --> 05:43.080
And then Jamie's like, I'm going to knit the listeners a sweater.

05:43.080 --> 05:50.040
Well, no, it was just like she wanted to put stories in and I forgot to put them in there.

05:50.040 --> 05:51.960
And I'm like, well, I can't do anything about it now.

05:51.960 --> 05:52.960
It's no big deal.

05:52.960 --> 05:53.960
I don't think anyone cares.

05:53.960 --> 05:54.960
I was trying to be funny.

05:54.960 --> 05:55.960
But it's just funny.

05:55.960 --> 05:56.960
I wasn't like, damn you woman.

05:56.960 --> 05:57.960
Why are you complaining?

05:57.960 --> 06:00.960
I was never like that.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.080
How can I be mad?

06:02.080 --> 06:03.080
I have chicken.

06:03.080 --> 06:04.080
No.

06:04.080 --> 06:05.080
How can anybody be mad?

06:05.080 --> 06:07.360
And Rob brought churro chips.

06:07.360 --> 06:08.360
That's right.

06:08.360 --> 06:09.360
These delicious.

06:09.360 --> 06:10.360
I'm going to endorse these.

06:10.360 --> 06:11.360
They don't pay me, but these chips are delicious.

06:11.360 --> 06:13.080
I think I would like another couple of them, please.

06:13.080 --> 06:16.600
They're Stacy's cinnamon sugar pita chips and they're delicious.

06:16.600 --> 06:18.040
And I bought them at Walgreens.

06:18.040 --> 06:19.040
No, wait, wait, wait.

06:19.040 --> 06:20.040
Get back in here.

06:20.040 --> 06:22.040
Wait, is a Dan approaches?

06:22.040 --> 06:23.040
Put your butt back in here.

06:23.040 --> 06:24.040
Throw the pester ball at Dan.

06:24.040 --> 06:25.040
See if he can catch his attention.

06:25.040 --> 06:26.040
Pester, pester.

06:26.040 --> 06:27.040
Baller, baller, baller, baller, baller, baller.

06:27.040 --> 06:29.040
I guess he didn't want to come in.

06:29.040 --> 06:30.040
All right.

06:30.040 --> 06:35.360
Anyhow, when he hears us saying something that he doesn't agree with, he'll pop in and

06:35.360 --> 06:36.360
let us know.

06:36.360 --> 06:37.360
All right, let's start off.

06:37.360 --> 06:41.360
You can know he's going to stick his head and go, bitches.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.360
All right.

06:43.360 --> 06:47.360
Dan was just trying to say hi to Alan.

06:47.360 --> 06:48.360
All right.

06:48.360 --> 06:49.920
Let's go around and see how everybody's gaming week was.

06:49.920 --> 06:52.480
Usually we start the show with a little bit of how is your gaming week, but tonight we're

06:52.480 --> 06:53.480
broken.

06:53.480 --> 06:56.560
If it's your first time listening, I'm sorry.

06:56.560 --> 06:59.080
If it's your 50th time listening, I'm sorry.

06:59.080 --> 07:02.480
All right, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

07:02.480 --> 07:07.120
It was a lot of Star Trek online because I have a new graphics card, or really I have

07:07.120 --> 07:10.080
someone else's old graphics card, but it's new to me.

07:10.080 --> 07:12.880
In fact, the box of it is sitting right behind you.

07:12.880 --> 07:13.880
It's a-

07:13.880 --> 07:14.880
Indeed.

07:14.880 --> 07:25.000
Oh, it's a GeForce 9800 GTX Plus Black Edition with bells and whistles and crack falling

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
out of it.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.840
Have you ever clocked it yet?

07:28.840 --> 07:29.840
No.

07:29.840 --> 07:30.840
You should.

07:30.840 --> 07:32.240
We'll see.

07:32.240 --> 07:34.920
Because it's easy and it's extra juice.

07:34.920 --> 07:35.920
We'll see.

07:35.920 --> 07:36.920
Okay.

07:36.920 --> 07:39.960
Why don't you ever clock the card, woman?

07:39.960 --> 07:42.320
Don't you know what you're doing?

07:42.320 --> 07:43.320
Well-

07:43.320 --> 07:44.320
I couldn't-

07:44.320 --> 07:45.320
I've had it.

07:45.320 --> 07:48.800
It went in on Wednesday.

07:48.800 --> 07:51.720
Since then, I've had a friend in the hospital.

07:51.720 --> 07:52.720
I've had homework.

07:52.720 --> 07:53.720
I've had a meeting-

07:53.720 --> 07:54.720
Is your friend okay?

07:54.720 --> 07:55.720
Is this someone I know?

07:55.720 --> 07:56.720
Are they okay?

07:56.720 --> 07:57.720
I don't think he-

07:57.720 --> 08:00.360
I haven't met him.

08:00.360 --> 08:07.440
One of my friends from Temple, he went in with something with his heart.

08:07.440 --> 08:11.200
I'll tell you more offline.

08:11.200 --> 08:15.280
So I went to see him at the hospital, and I've been trying to play Star Trek online

08:15.280 --> 08:20.560
today, but my internet's been kind of-

08:20.560 --> 08:23.920
Every time I would pick a system to go to, it would-

08:23.920 --> 08:29.960
Okay, you know on Ragnarok Online, when you would have a hiccup, and your character would

08:29.960 --> 08:33.920
just suddenly back up a bajillion miles back from wherever you were before?

08:33.920 --> 08:38.240
I understand, but I'll bet you maybe 1% of the listenership understands.

08:38.240 --> 08:44.720
Well, it'd be like, my ship would hiccup, it would backtrack, so you'd actually see

08:44.720 --> 08:49.360
the trails going backwards ahead of the ship, and it would change direction.

08:49.360 --> 08:51.280
And I'm like, what the hell?

08:51.280 --> 08:57.200
So basically your computer was telling you, I can't keep it moving, I don't have the power!

08:57.200 --> 09:02.640
It wasn't even letting- giving me any option to enter the system when I was manually controlling

09:02.640 --> 09:03.640
it to go there.

09:03.640 --> 09:08.080
I was like, well crap, I can't, you know, level, but I started my Klingon the other

09:08.080 --> 09:10.160
night, and that was pretty cool.

09:10.160 --> 09:11.600
I have Klingon now.

09:11.600 --> 09:12.600
So the system was down.

09:12.600 --> 09:14.240
The system is down, dude.

09:14.240 --> 09:15.640
The system is down.

09:15.640 --> 09:16.640
Okay.

09:16.640 --> 09:21.000
I was also playing little clone games on my Linux box.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.920
I was playing, I think it was called like, Penguin Freeze or something, and it's best

09:24.920 --> 09:27.060
to move with penguins.

09:27.060 --> 09:34.000
And they had Connect Four, and I was playing Minesweeper, and the little, you know, just-

09:34.000 --> 09:36.120
Is socially awkward penguin in the game?

09:36.120 --> 09:38.280
I guess.

09:38.280 --> 09:45.440
And then, I was playing Puzzle Bobble in Flash, which is pretty fun.

09:45.440 --> 09:49.360
And that's about it, yeah.

09:49.360 --> 09:50.360
Alright.

09:50.360 --> 09:52.680
And I slept.

09:52.680 --> 09:53.680
Techmaster Loki.

09:53.680 --> 09:54.680
How was your gaming week?

09:54.680 --> 09:59.020
Actually, before I get to that, I should say, some of the people in chat are commenting

09:59.020 --> 10:02.160
on the exchange earlier about the Switching Personalities night.

10:02.160 --> 10:05.040
Sj100matt, go USA in chat.

10:05.040 --> 10:06.360
That's right, it's Olympics time.

10:06.360 --> 10:11.640
Sj100matt says, Loki missed posting stories, but at least he has chicken.

10:11.640 --> 10:15.560
Loki Jenkins.

10:15.560 --> 10:18.160
I just wanted honey barbecue chicken.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.160
Every now and then I get the craving for it.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.760
There's nothing wrong with chicken.

10:20.760 --> 10:25.280
You know, I kind of have a cold right now, so it was the only thing that sounded good.

10:25.280 --> 10:27.840
Chicken and vitamin C. Orange chicken.

10:27.840 --> 10:28.840
Yeah.

10:28.840 --> 10:30.840
Orange chicken, yeah.

10:30.840 --> 10:33.120
There you go.

10:33.120 --> 10:35.760
Let's see, this week, didn't play a whole lot of stuff.

10:35.760 --> 10:43.000
I did put in a good five hours worth of Borderlands though yesterday, so that was fun.

10:43.000 --> 10:48.480
Started doing Mad Moxie's Underdome Riot, and it's very tedious.

10:48.480 --> 10:54.160
Although I did play one round with a friend earlier in the week during lunch, and it was

10:54.160 --> 10:58.280
actually pretty fun co-op, but single player, man, it's pretty boring.

10:58.280 --> 11:04.680
But it was cool, so I played that a little bit, and I'm just kind of working through

11:04.680 --> 11:05.680
Borderlands still.

11:05.680 --> 11:09.560
It's still very fun, and can't wait for the next expansion to come out.

11:09.560 --> 11:10.560
That would be pretty cool.

11:10.560 --> 11:12.880
Although, what a weird level cap though.

11:12.880 --> 11:16.200
They capped it at 61 in the new expansion.

11:16.200 --> 11:17.200
Huh.

11:17.200 --> 11:19.600
I mean, it's like, okay.

11:19.600 --> 11:24.400
Well, maybe there's going to be four more expansions, so it'll be 62, and then 63.

11:24.400 --> 11:25.400
Who knows?

11:25.400 --> 11:31.160
It's still dumb, but 61, okay, that's what you want to stop at, fine with me.

11:31.160 --> 11:33.680
And then, of course, more Grand Theft Auto.

11:33.680 --> 11:47.240
In fact, actually, I want to say that I'm in the top 200 now for cumulative.

11:47.240 --> 11:51.840
I'm not really sure about that, but I know for a fact though, I'm in like the mid 70s

11:51.840 --> 11:59.600
now for true skill rankings, so I'm in the top 75 players in the world, so that's pretty

11:59.600 --> 12:00.600
awesome.

12:00.600 --> 12:04.400
And if one of our listeners wants to serve you a slice of humble pie, how can they do

12:04.400 --> 12:05.400
that?

12:05.400 --> 12:06.400
Just find me online.

12:06.400 --> 12:12.360
We play just ranked games now, so if you happen to be playing a ranked game around 10, 1030-ish,

12:12.360 --> 12:18.560
you know, 3, 330, and then sometime between noon and one, depending on if we're playing

12:18.560 --> 12:23.720
during lunch, you should be able to find us, because there's no one on there.

12:23.720 --> 12:25.080
So it's pretty easy.

12:25.080 --> 12:31.640
We have four systems and we're able to get into ranked games together easy, so...

12:31.640 --> 12:35.600
We're looking for people to play because everybody keeps dropping one when they play with us

12:35.600 --> 12:38.640
because they get pissed off that we kick the crap out of them.

12:38.640 --> 12:42.080
And not that we do it on purpose, I kick the crap out of everybody, including my coworkers,

12:42.080 --> 12:46.740
and they get pissed off too, but, you know.

12:46.740 --> 12:47.740
I don't know.

12:47.740 --> 12:49.520
QQ more.

12:49.520 --> 12:52.040
They make fun of me, they're like, what?

12:52.040 --> 12:55.800
And they'll get ahead or something and they'll be just like, aww, you're just sucking it

12:55.800 --> 13:01.200
up today, blah, blah, blah, I'm like, alright, now I gotta kill you.

13:01.200 --> 13:05.120
See how they go and do that, and now you're just gonna learn the lesson that's involved

13:05.120 --> 13:09.960
with, you know, criticizing my playing.

13:09.960 --> 13:12.280
And that is death.

13:12.280 --> 13:14.560
Lots and lots of death.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.560
In very humiliating ways.

13:16.560 --> 13:18.120
So yeah.

13:18.120 --> 13:19.120
Alright.

13:19.120 --> 13:22.760
My gaming week, not a whole lot to report on.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.000
I moved this week, though, I have a really good excuse.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.120
I have a new place that I'm living at, and I'm still without internet, so not even a

13:29.120 --> 13:32.280
lot of wow this weekend, it's kinda sad.

13:32.280 --> 13:35.960
But I did play a little bit of wow, of course, earlier in the week, I mean, come on, it's

13:35.960 --> 13:37.160
me we're talking about.

13:37.160 --> 13:40.120
I was playing that right up until they unplugged the internet.

13:40.120 --> 13:45.360
And then after that, probably my other big gaming thing was that I actually went to Roseville

13:45.360 --> 13:49.160
Golf Lamb this week, the great place where video games go to die.

13:49.160 --> 13:52.880
Although I have to say, the games I was interested in playing were all working fine, and I did

13:52.880 --> 13:56.400
play lots and lots of BeatMania Distorted, and I was playing the old school songs in

13:56.400 --> 13:57.400
Distorted.

13:57.400 --> 14:00.760
But I know Alan tried playing, like, King of Fighters, or something, what was wrong?

14:00.760 --> 14:04.160
You were playing, what, King of Fighters 98 or something, what were you playing there?

14:04.160 --> 14:07.160
Yeah, it was King of Fighters 2003.

14:07.160 --> 14:13.720
And the first player side had a button missing, and the second player side couldn't move left.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.160
Or forward when you're second player.

14:15.160 --> 14:19.000
So that was a great time.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.760
So it's so easy to fix, too, though.

14:20.760 --> 14:23.000
Imagine trying to play a fighting game without moving forward.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.440
You know, this means photo time again.

14:26.440 --> 14:31.720
But I gotta say, the 2DX machine worked fine, and all the music games actually seemed to

14:31.720 --> 14:32.840
be in really good shape.

14:32.840 --> 14:34.840
You were playing DJ Max Technica.

14:34.840 --> 14:36.240
Yeah, that was working fine, right?

14:36.240 --> 14:39.320
I'm gonna give you an example of how long it's been since I've been there.

14:39.320 --> 14:45.240
They didn't have the 2DX machine set up the last time I was there.

14:45.240 --> 14:46.240
You know what?

14:46.240 --> 14:48.160
Not a lot's changed, I gotta be honest.

14:48.160 --> 14:51.880
It's a lot of ticket redemption machines still, and this is really true of any arcade I could

14:51.880 --> 14:52.880
probably mention.

14:52.880 --> 14:53.880
It's mostly ticket redemption machines.

14:53.880 --> 14:54.880
It's a safe bet.

14:54.880 --> 14:55.880
Yeah.

14:55.880 --> 15:00.960
I did play a little bit, Alan and I sparred on Mario Kart, and it's nothing like Mario

15:00.960 --> 15:01.960
Kart, the home version.

15:01.960 --> 15:06.680
You know, I've been wanting to play the second one, because they have a second GPRK, but

15:06.680 --> 15:10.080
yeah, the GPRK ones are kind of boring, actually.

15:10.080 --> 15:13.360
But hey, port them in the home systems.

15:13.360 --> 15:14.360
Make them playable online.

15:14.360 --> 15:15.360
Oh, wait.

15:15.360 --> 15:16.360
I'm asking too much.

15:16.360 --> 15:17.960
All right, so that was pretty much my gaming week.

15:17.960 --> 15:21.560
Not a lot of exciting stuff, because, you know, without me moving right now, hopefully

15:21.560 --> 15:22.560
I'll have more next week.

15:22.560 --> 15:25.840
I know I will in two weeks, when Final Fantasy XIII's out, so just wait.

15:25.840 --> 15:26.840
Alan, how was your-

15:26.840 --> 15:28.400
It's only two weeks away.

15:28.400 --> 15:29.400
I know.

15:29.400 --> 15:30.400
It's exciting.

15:30.400 --> 15:31.400
It is exciting.

15:31.400 --> 15:32.400
I'm so excited.

15:32.400 --> 15:33.400
All right, Alan, how was your gaming week?

15:33.400 --> 15:34.400
What'd you play?

15:34.400 --> 15:39.200
I played a lot of WoW, because for some reason, you know, someone got me into that.

15:39.200 --> 15:43.120
I don't know who, but yeah, so lots of WoW.

15:43.120 --> 15:45.480
Logged into my City of Heroes characters.

15:45.480 --> 15:48.240
I still play that.

15:48.240 --> 15:53.000
The next expansion, Going Rogue, is actually due out in July.

15:53.000 --> 15:58.920
So I just logged in to, you know, get- refamiliarized myself with my characters.

15:58.920 --> 16:03.240
Played some Gyromancer, the DLC, the extra hard maps.

16:03.240 --> 16:04.240
Now that it works.

16:04.240 --> 16:07.000
Yes, now that it works.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.840
And a Valkyrie profile DS is really what I'm playing right now.

16:10.840 --> 16:12.840
Very cool.

16:12.840 --> 16:15.840
City of Heroes, real quick, because it's not a game we've talked a lot about on the show.

16:15.840 --> 16:18.000
I think we've all kind of, like, dabbled in it a little bit.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.440
I've got the architect addition in my closet.

16:20.440 --> 16:24.720
Like, I know you kind of played it, like, a little bit, but not, like, extensively,

16:24.720 --> 16:25.720
right?

16:25.720 --> 16:29.040
What does City of Heroes have, because you're obviously still playing it while you're juggling

16:29.040 --> 16:30.040
WoW.

16:30.040 --> 16:34.600
What does City of Heroes have for you in an MMO that WoW is lacking?

16:34.600 --> 16:41.040
The ability to come up with a very strong character concept, and the costume designer

16:41.040 --> 16:44.360
is so powerful that you can pretty much have a completely unique character.

16:44.360 --> 16:45.360
Oh, I love that.

16:45.360 --> 16:50.600
I downloaded that little Korean client that you could just play with all day and not have

16:50.600 --> 16:51.600
to even have an account.

16:51.600 --> 16:53.840
That was so much fun.

16:53.840 --> 16:57.920
And I did notice that when you were showing me your thing, like, how you could, like,

16:57.920 --> 17:00.200
go in a phone booth and you'd have, like, the different costumes.

17:00.200 --> 17:02.420
You could save, like, five different costume presets.

17:02.420 --> 17:06.640
It didn't seem to affect your abilities at all whatsoever, at least that I noticed.

17:06.640 --> 17:07.640
I don't know.

17:07.640 --> 17:08.640
Maybe it did.

17:08.640 --> 17:10.880
And then, like, you had a little bio written on your character, and you'd actually kind

17:10.880 --> 17:14.280
of written a whole little thing, and I was thinking, this is like an RP type of player's

17:14.280 --> 17:15.280
dream.

17:15.280 --> 17:19.080
City of Heroes has an amazing RP community, and I think that's...

17:19.080 --> 17:23.160
It's almost a six-year-old game, and for them to be releasing a major expansion six years

17:23.160 --> 17:27.000
after the fact, there has to be the money there in the subscriptions, and it's mostly

17:27.000 --> 17:29.680
the RP-ers that are sticking around.

17:29.680 --> 17:30.680
Six...

17:30.680 --> 17:32.760
And WoW's probably been around about five, six years.

17:32.760 --> 17:36.320
Well, it just had its fifth anniversary, so it's been around about as long, yeah.

17:36.320 --> 17:40.880
Yeah, City of Heroes was huge for the first six or seven months, and then when WoW came

17:40.880 --> 17:49.160
out, there was sort of a big vacuum, but it's server population's kind of low, but yeah,

17:49.160 --> 17:50.160
there's still a community.

17:50.160 --> 17:51.160
Well, a lot of MMOs like that.

17:51.160 --> 17:54.840
I mean, Final Fantasy XI, you know, it took a little hit when WoW came out, but I think

17:54.840 --> 17:58.200
the audiences for those two games are very different, but I just, I know because I was

17:58.200 --> 18:01.040
playing Final Fantasy XI and kind of went back and forth for a little while between

18:01.040 --> 18:03.920
that and WoW when it first came out, but there's definitely, you know, there's always gonna

18:03.920 --> 18:07.760
be those diehards that just love the game, and I think especially when you bring that

18:07.760 --> 18:11.960
RP component into it, you know, I don't know, I mean, Final Fantasy XI had somewhat, you

18:11.960 --> 18:15.400
could do, I mean, you could do the RP with any game, but I could see where City of Heroes

18:15.400 --> 18:17.280
really let you embrace that, you know.

18:17.280 --> 18:21.280
Final Fantasy XI, if you think WoW's limited with how your character can look, Final Fantasy

18:21.280 --> 18:23.400
XI's really limiting too, so...

18:23.400 --> 18:30.840
Well, I have to say that, you know, the moment I moved on to Star Trek Online, I forgot about

18:30.840 --> 18:33.280
World of Warcraft, really, I did.

18:33.280 --> 18:36.360
What is it, okay, then let me ask you the same question I asked Alan, what is it about

18:36.360 --> 18:40.120
Star Trek Online that had it for you that WoW didn't, or is it just, I know you love

18:40.120 --> 18:42.080
Star Trek, is it just the fandom, period?

18:42.080 --> 18:47.720
It's really not just the fandom, it's the fact that I really can play by myself, you

18:47.720 --> 18:52.900
know, I don't have to, it's annoying as fuck to party with people, really.

18:52.900 --> 18:56.480
It's annoying, it pisses me off, I hate doing it.

18:56.480 --> 19:00.200
You know, even when it's one of my friends, after like an hour of following behind somebody,

19:00.200 --> 19:02.880
I'm like, okay, I'm tired of this, this is monotonous.

19:02.880 --> 19:08.400
Whereas in Star Trek Online, it's like when you are doing your instances, you go into

19:08.400 --> 19:12.020
an area and you may have three people already there, complete strangers, and you can run

19:12.020 --> 19:16.060
through your series of instances together, when you're done with it, that's it.

19:16.060 --> 19:19.160
You don't have to really hang out with them, you don't have to follow them around, you

19:19.160 --> 19:21.040
can do your own thing.

19:21.040 --> 19:26.000
Like I had one person go into one instance, and I went to a completely different one,

19:26.000 --> 19:31.680
and we all got, you know, the points for it, because it was still, we were working together.

19:31.680 --> 19:37.000
And that's what I like, is it's sort of, it's teamwork, but you can choose if you want to

19:37.000 --> 19:44.420
do a fleet mission, and it feels like an episode, it's got enough random in it that it really

19:44.420 --> 19:45.860
keeps my interest in it.

19:45.860 --> 19:49.680
I will just quickly say this in WoW's defense, is that since you left, they did roll out

19:49.680 --> 19:53.440
the Looking for Dungeon tool, which has really helped with a lot of the instancing in that

19:53.440 --> 19:54.440
game.

19:54.440 --> 19:55.440
That was the one while I was playing it.

19:55.440 --> 19:56.440
Oh was it?

19:56.440 --> 19:57.440
Yeah.

19:57.440 --> 19:58.440
Oh wow.

19:58.440 --> 19:59.440
And now they're going to be rolling out, and I don't think it's in our show world this

19:59.440 --> 20:02.600
week, I apologize if I'm bumping a story, but Looking for PvP is coming out as well

20:02.600 --> 20:03.600
very soon.

20:03.600 --> 20:04.600
Nope, you're not.

20:04.600 --> 20:05.600
I hate PvP.

20:05.600 --> 20:11.880
You know, but I gotta admit, from a WoW standpoint, you know, I realize not everybody's into it,

20:11.880 --> 20:15.540
which is cool, but for me, why I like WoW is that it is such a robust game.

20:15.540 --> 20:18.800
You know, I can just log in, it's like, oh, I'm gonna just go slip right into a dungeon,

20:18.800 --> 20:22.920
or, you know, nobody else is online, maybe I'll go PvP by myself, or hey, Alan's online,

20:22.920 --> 20:25.440
we're gonna go quest together, and it's like we're hanging out, but we're not, because

20:25.440 --> 20:26.440
we're nerds.

20:26.440 --> 20:31.240
I totally don't mind, though, doing PvP, though, if I get to smash some Klingons in the face.

20:31.240 --> 20:35.760
I just can't wait until we get Romulan and Cardassian missions.

20:35.760 --> 20:36.880
Is that like a future expansion?

20:36.880 --> 20:39.440
Yeah, I think that's gonna be a future thing.

20:39.440 --> 20:45.280
I will play some more Star Trek online, but see, there's this big thing kind of hovering

20:45.280 --> 20:51.600
in the distance, and that is Final Fantasy XIV, and I just know, like, I have to play

20:51.600 --> 20:52.600
it.

20:52.600 --> 20:56.600
I have to, I've sucked three years, I mean, if you guys think I talk about WoW a lot,

20:56.600 --> 21:01.480
you should have been on the show three, four years ago, like, do you remember when we used

21:01.480 --> 21:03.200
to talk about the fairy server?

21:03.200 --> 21:05.080
I mean, that's old school, okay?

21:05.080 --> 21:06.080
I used to play with you.

21:06.080 --> 21:09.300
I don't, we used to talk, I mean, I used to just talk about Final Fantasy XI all the

21:09.300 --> 21:13.780
freaking time on the show, so, I mean, I have to try XIV, just because I sunk so much time

21:13.780 --> 21:14.780
into XI.

21:14.780 --> 21:18.980
I mean, I gave XI a really good try, I mean, you were here watching me play, doing the

21:18.980 --> 21:20.640
freaking macros on my controller.

21:20.640 --> 21:23.440
But if you hate grouping with people, XI stinks.

21:23.440 --> 21:24.440
It does.

21:24.440 --> 21:27.600
I mean, XI is about forced, the enemy?

21:27.600 --> 21:28.600
It is forced grouping.

21:28.600 --> 21:32.120
To be fair, they fixed a lot of that, like, years later, like, after I left with the level

21:32.120 --> 21:34.160
sink and everything, but, you know.

21:34.160 --> 21:38.800
Well, you know, my big problem with that one is just that, you know, maybe it was just

21:38.800 --> 21:42.500
because I was playing the White Mage, maybe it was because I was the party bitch.

21:42.500 --> 21:48.800
You know, it finally, and I've told the story before, the final straw for that game was

21:48.800 --> 21:53.040
me calling everybody over with my little dinky, okay, I will go back, actually, playing with

21:53.040 --> 21:55.360
Japanese players is not annoying.

21:55.360 --> 21:57.360
They know how to party.

21:57.360 --> 21:58.360
If you know what I mean.

21:58.360 --> 21:59.880
They're the only ones that would respect a bard.

21:59.880 --> 22:03.400
That's right, I remember when you tried to play a bard.

22:03.400 --> 22:08.940
Dude, I was a pimp-ass bard, but, you know, just no one wanted to play the bard, I rocked

22:08.940 --> 22:09.940
the bard.

22:09.940 --> 22:17.860
And if you would, see, here's your proof, angry Loki, when you talk about, you know,

22:17.860 --> 22:21.040
some of the hacking and the stuff, he gets angry Loki.

22:21.040 --> 22:24.180
I rocked the bard.

22:24.180 --> 22:26.240
But then, what angry man says that?

22:26.240 --> 22:29.900
But remember, you can also swap out the music and stuff in there, because there was that

22:29.900 --> 22:34.680
little trick you could do, and so I would have, like, smack my bitch up to, like, the

22:34.680 --> 22:35.680
battle music.

22:35.680 --> 22:36.680
It was awesome.

22:36.680 --> 22:40.160
Dude, I remember when you would mount up on the chocobo, and it would play the theme from

22:40.160 --> 22:41.760
the Neverending Story.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.760
Oh, yeah?

22:43.760 --> 22:45.600
Oh, yes.

22:45.600 --> 22:48.120
Oh, that's fun.

22:48.120 --> 22:51.800
Well, what my story was, as I was saying.

22:51.800 --> 22:52.800
Sorry.

22:52.800 --> 22:53.800
It's okay.

22:53.800 --> 22:54.800
No, I think that's funny.

22:54.800 --> 22:55.800
It was worth it.

22:55.800 --> 22:56.800
Smack my bitch up.

22:56.800 --> 22:59.600
Anyway, so my little character, you know, because when you throw out your macros, you

22:59.600 --> 23:04.160
can call everyone in your party to come back to you so that you can do an area effect buff.

23:04.160 --> 23:09.840
And I was finally, like, I did the buff, everything, then this one guy comes in, hey, I'm in the

23:09.840 --> 23:10.840
buff.

23:10.840 --> 23:13.840
I'm like, fuck you, log out.

23:13.840 --> 23:14.840
And that was it.

23:14.840 --> 23:15.840
I never played again.

23:15.840 --> 23:16.840
All right.

23:16.840 --> 23:22.960
I totally remember, I totally forgot about Falkor's Ride or whatever it said to the chocobo,

23:22.960 --> 23:25.000
but it was awesome.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.020
It was very epic.

23:27.020 --> 23:29.840
This was when Loki and I lived together, and, like, we had our computers, like, kind of,

23:29.840 --> 23:31.840
like, right next to each other, like, they're here in the studio.

23:31.840 --> 23:35.040
So, you know, I'd be doing my thing in Final Fantasy XI, and then, like, I'm like, okay,

23:35.040 --> 23:38.260
because, you know, Loki and I would play together sometimes because we're nerds, right?

23:38.260 --> 23:42.200
And I'd say, like, okay, Loki, come meet me in Altepa Desert and let's party.

23:42.200 --> 23:45.160
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

23:45.160 --> 23:49.400
And, like, Loki's fanfare is, like, coming from the computer.

23:49.400 --> 23:50.400
And then I'll say...

23:50.400 --> 23:51.400
Bring your harp.

23:51.400 --> 23:52.400
No, then I'll...

23:52.400 --> 23:57.600
I did that, though, with Ragnarok for a little while, because it's all MP3s, so you could

23:57.600 --> 23:58.600
change out the music.

23:58.600 --> 24:02.600
So, I remember going into...

24:02.600 --> 24:07.400
It was this one place that used to have this big, epic music, and it was, like, instead

24:07.400 --> 24:10.160
it was a bassoon quartet.

24:10.160 --> 24:11.160
There was another one.

24:11.160 --> 24:13.320
The group party music that I had was...

24:13.320 --> 24:15.120
The battle music was the theme...

24:15.120 --> 24:19.800
It wasn't the theme of Zanarkand or whatever, but it's from Final Fantasy XI.

24:19.800 --> 24:21.960
It was the jacked, angry music.

24:21.960 --> 24:22.960
I remember that.

24:22.960 --> 24:23.960
Otherworld.

24:23.960 --> 24:25.960
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

24:25.960 --> 24:26.960
Otherworld.

24:26.960 --> 24:27.960
It was awesome.

24:27.960 --> 24:31.560
And Final Fantasy X, I remember it from your frickin', like, every time.

24:31.560 --> 24:35.320
Because I was a healer, so I never really engaged the monster, but, like, you know,

24:35.320 --> 24:36.320
when you...

24:36.320 --> 24:39.720
I think you finally started Black Mage instead of Bard, and, you know, we'd be fighting,

24:39.720 --> 24:45.920
you know, the killer level 60 rabbit or whatever, and then, like, okay, engage the rabbit.

24:45.920 --> 24:47.920
Doo doo doo doo doo doo.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.440
Like you just had the most epic bunny killing music I've ever heard in my life.

24:50.440 --> 24:55.080
I just hope that's the only thing that they include from Final Fantasy XI in XIV, is the

24:55.080 --> 24:56.320
ability to change the music out.

24:56.320 --> 24:58.040
You're not supposed to be able to do that.

24:58.040 --> 24:59.040
You just like to hack things.

24:59.040 --> 25:00.040
Oh, who cares?

25:00.040 --> 25:01.040
Yes.

25:01.040 --> 25:02.040
All right.

25:02.040 --> 25:05.560
Anyhow, boy, we're not even, like, into the gaming news yet.

25:05.560 --> 25:06.560
Hey.

25:06.560 --> 25:07.560
You know what?

25:07.560 --> 25:09.120
If I was gonna do that, then my battle music would be bitches.

25:09.120 --> 25:13.240
I mean, mindless self-indulgence.

25:13.240 --> 25:14.400
I don't know what mine would be.

25:14.400 --> 25:16.920
What would be some good battle music for me, Alan?

25:16.920 --> 25:17.920
I'm trying to think.

25:17.920 --> 25:19.720
For Final Fantasy XIV, if I could hack the music.

25:19.720 --> 25:21.720
What are you guys talking about?

25:21.720 --> 25:25.800
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

25:25.800 --> 25:26.800
Anyhow.

25:26.800 --> 25:31.680
Actually, Shaoran in the chat room, I hope I pronounced that right, chat.orange.radio.com

25:31.680 --> 25:36.000
says, has a suggestion, if Star Trek Online had a customizable music, OLR would need to

25:36.000 --> 25:38.760
bring in, I'm on a boat.

25:38.760 --> 25:44.720
I would totally do that for the, you know how they have the fairies you could take?

25:44.720 --> 25:50.520
Oh yeah, I remember the first time taking a fairy in Final Fantasy XI.

25:50.520 --> 25:53.720
Like I got on the little fairy, cause like, you know, getting around in Final Fantasy

25:53.720 --> 25:54.720
XI kind of sucks.

25:54.720 --> 25:57.080
It takes like 30 minutes to get from one thing to the other.

25:57.080 --> 25:58.080
So you'd get on the boat.

25:58.080 --> 26:01.480
I remember the first time I ever took a boat ride, you know, it's like, doo doo doo doo

26:01.480 --> 26:02.480
doo doo doo doo doo.

26:02.480 --> 26:03.480
You know, happy little boat music.

26:03.480 --> 26:06.840
And then all of a sudden it gets really dark, doo doo doo doo doo.

26:06.840 --> 26:10.640
We fricking got raided by pirates the first time I ever rode a boat in the game.

26:10.640 --> 26:14.240
And now, but I, I remember that being an epic moment of Final Fantasy XI.

26:14.240 --> 26:17.060
I was like, that was actually really cool that the boats will randomly get raided by

26:17.060 --> 26:18.060
pirates.

26:18.060 --> 26:22.000
And like, I would, you would have to, as a low level character, literally run and hide

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
in the basement.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.800
I think I had to, cause you like, you came and got me one time.

26:26.800 --> 26:31.640
Well, someone dragged a Kraken down the stairs.

26:31.640 --> 26:36.560
Anyhow, I have to say though, I still, to this day, remember the look on your face when

26:36.560 --> 26:38.600
I was doing my macros on my controller.

26:38.600 --> 26:42.120
I was very impressed with the way you were doing the, but, but then I couldn't, that's

26:42.120 --> 26:43.120
what I hated in World of Warcraft.

26:43.120 --> 26:44.840
I couldn't use my damn controller.

26:44.840 --> 26:49.280
Final Fantasy XI was built for the PS2, you know, and I have to remember losing controller.

26:49.280 --> 26:51.120
That's the way most of the Japanese players do it now.

26:51.120 --> 26:55.000
And some American ones as well, obviously, but I cannot imagine that game without a computer

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
keyboard.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Anyway.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
I agree with Rama.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.200
When did this become Final Fantasy Radio?

26:59.200 --> 27:00.200
I don't know.

27:00.200 --> 27:01.200
So let's move on.

27:01.200 --> 27:04.720
Let's get into some housekeeping tonight and talk a little bit about what's going on with

27:04.720 --> 27:09.600
OLR before we get into the gaming news tonight.

27:09.600 --> 27:15.020
I don't have a whole lot of show specific news besides, don't forget that you can always

27:15.020 --> 27:17.000
join us on our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.840
And of course we're on Facebook as well.

27:18.840 --> 27:23.720
Orange Lounge Radio there, Addis is your friend and we will usually make updates except tonight

27:23.720 --> 27:26.920
because with all the internet hiccup we had earlier, we didn't get onto many of the social

27:26.920 --> 27:32.360
networking, but also, uh, we got a voicemail from Breslul and he wants to update you guys

27:32.360 --> 27:36.560
on usl madness and what is going on there in our forums.

27:36.560 --> 27:41.920
So I want to go to the voicemail and oh, did I delete it?

27:41.920 --> 27:42.920
I hope not.

27:42.920 --> 27:43.920
Oops.

27:43.920 --> 27:46.760
When we did the reboot earlier, I might've deleted his voicemail.

27:46.760 --> 27:47.760
Whoopsie.

27:47.760 --> 27:50.200
Let's see if I can get to it here.

27:50.200 --> 27:51.200
And here we go.

27:51.200 --> 27:52.200
Here's his voicemail.

27:52.200 --> 27:55.280
Here's a voicemail from Breslul about what is going on in usl madness at our forums at

27:55.280 --> 27:56.280
orange launch radio.com.

27:56.280 --> 28:05.360
Hello Orange Lounge Radio, it's Breslul once again, reminding you and the listeners to give

28:05.360 --> 28:08.240
us some votes here on usl madness.

28:08.240 --> 28:11.440
We have some fantastic match-ups in the round of 32.

28:11.440 --> 28:14.960
We've got a heated one between Final Fantasy 7 and Pokemon.

28:14.960 --> 28:19.280
Mega Man 2 is facing Mega Man 3, one of the most bizarre match-ups of the tournament.

28:19.280 --> 28:23.120
Ocarina of Timers and Tecmo Super Bowl, Earthbound vs Secret of Mana.

28:23.120 --> 28:26.080
I could go on, but there's not enough time in the show.

28:26.080 --> 28:31.040
But please visit our forums, get yourself an account and vote today because half of

28:31.040 --> 28:37.400
these games go away and then next week is the sweet 16 where things get incredibly interesting.

28:37.400 --> 28:40.880
Once again, log on to our forums and vote.

28:40.880 --> 28:48.120
We'll talk to you later and usl will be back on the, let me try that again, usl will be

28:48.120 --> 28:51.800
back on February 27th.

28:51.800 --> 28:52.800
We'll see you then.

28:52.800 --> 28:53.800
Till then.

28:53.800 --> 29:00.120
Now that was Breslul from Understation Live, Saturday nights at All Games Radio, allgamesradio.com

29:00.120 --> 29:05.000
or if you want just the radio feed, it's allgamesradio.com and they'll be back on Saturday.

29:05.000 --> 29:09.160
But yeah, Breslul and Travis, they team up with us to do this usl madness, which is kind

29:09.160 --> 29:12.360
of like a take on March Madness, if you don't know what it is, where they try to define

29:12.360 --> 29:17.160
the greatest video game of all time and everybody submits their list and then he seeds it like

29:17.160 --> 29:18.640
it was basketball games.

29:18.640 --> 29:20.440
And Guardian Legend wins.

29:20.440 --> 29:23.520
Guardian Legend wasn't even like in the top 64 on people's list.

29:23.520 --> 29:24.520
It was on my list.

29:24.520 --> 29:28.000
I had it in my top 25 games of all time, but I guess that wasn't enough because admittedly

29:28.000 --> 29:30.400
it wasn't number one, sorry Jamie.

29:30.400 --> 29:33.520
But there's, yeah, as he said in the voicemail, there's some pretty epic match-ups going on

29:33.520 --> 29:34.520
right now.

29:34.520 --> 29:37.440
Like Mega Man 2 versus Mega Man 3, how do you even decide between those two games?

29:37.440 --> 29:39.720
Like it's practically the same guy.

29:39.720 --> 29:40.840
I said two as well.

29:40.840 --> 29:42.800
What is it that draws you to two over three though?

29:42.800 --> 29:43.800
Do you think?

29:43.800 --> 29:47.600
I like the number two better than three.

29:47.600 --> 29:49.720
Bubble Man stage music.

29:49.720 --> 29:51.320
Metal blades.

29:51.320 --> 29:55.160
I think it's just the fact that, well for me and the way I rationalized it when I voted

29:55.160 --> 29:58.520
on the forums was that Mega Man 2 was kind of set the bar.

29:58.520 --> 30:02.960
Like obviously Mega Man 1 was the original, but you know, it had all these things like

30:02.960 --> 30:06.600
scoring and less bosses and kind of a different interface and everything.

30:06.600 --> 30:10.760
Mega Man 2 kind of really polished that and really Mega Man 3 is just Mega Man 2 with

30:10.760 --> 30:12.920
some new thrills in it.

30:12.920 --> 30:17.920
But Mega Man 2 was so important that those bosses came back in three.

30:17.920 --> 30:22.120
Mega Man 2 was one of my, I'd have to say my big accomplishments because I used to be

30:22.120 --> 30:23.640
able to do the dragon level blindfolded.

30:23.640 --> 30:26.640
I remember, I remember you telling me about that and I used to be able to play that game

30:26.640 --> 30:28.440
like, you know, through in one sitting too.

30:28.440 --> 30:31.120
Because that level has like, it's all about timing with that level.

30:31.120 --> 30:33.520
The only other, like I said, the only other game I've been able to do that with is World

30:33.520 --> 30:35.160
8-1 and Super Mario Brothers.

30:35.160 --> 30:36.160
Nice.

30:36.160 --> 30:37.160
Very cool.

30:37.160 --> 30:40.040
Yeah, so I don't know, it's just something about, I mean not that Mega Man 3 is a bad

30:40.040 --> 30:43.720
game by any means, but that's the tough thing about March Madness is you have to sometimes

30:43.720 --> 30:44.720
look at two good games.

30:44.720 --> 30:46.040
Now here's the other interesting one.

30:46.040 --> 30:49.160
There's Final Fantasy 7 versus Pokemon going on right now.

30:49.160 --> 30:54.160
And I notice there's interesting, Pokemon is winning as of the time of the show.

30:54.160 --> 30:58.520
Final Fantasy 7 is, it seems like a lot of the vote isn't, I mean I could be wrong, but

30:58.520 --> 31:03.420
there's a lot of vote that is not for Pokemon so much as it is against Final Fantasy 7 because

31:03.420 --> 31:04.420
of all the fanboy wank.

31:04.420 --> 31:08.520
And I was trying to figure out why that is because I don't think Final Fantasy 7 is the

31:08.520 --> 31:14.480
best Final Fantasy, but certainly like, it was the game that got me to buy a Playstation.

31:14.480 --> 31:15.480
It was, you know.

31:15.480 --> 31:18.080
I owned that game before, I had a Playstation.

31:18.080 --> 31:19.080
How does that work?

31:19.080 --> 31:20.080
My roommate had one.

31:20.080 --> 31:21.080
Oh.

31:21.080 --> 31:25.840
And yeah, you know, I just remember it just changed the way you kind of perceive Final

31:25.840 --> 31:29.000
Fantasy games because it was so different from the sprite based ones.

31:29.000 --> 31:35.120
But I agree the fan wank got a little crazy, but I can't hold that against the game.

31:35.120 --> 31:39.880
But I don't know, but then you look at a series like Pokemon and that's like a cult.

31:39.880 --> 31:44.760
That's like, I don't even know, like Pokemon sucks people in and doesn't let them go.

31:44.760 --> 31:45.760
It's like.

31:45.760 --> 31:46.760
I don't get it.

31:46.760 --> 31:47.760
Yeah.

31:47.760 --> 31:48.760
I don't know.

31:48.760 --> 31:49.760
But yeah, whatever.

31:49.760 --> 31:50.980
I can't be mad I guess.

31:50.980 --> 31:51.980
That's what happens.

31:51.980 --> 31:55.000
Every gamer has a voice even when that voice is whack.

31:55.000 --> 31:59.480
Www dot orange lounge radio.com no disrespect to the Pokemon fans.

31:59.480 --> 32:04.160
I just, I, to me, they're kind of all the same game.

32:04.160 --> 32:06.000
Like I are all the same game.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
Look.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
Oh my God.

32:08.000 --> 32:12.320
We discovered new Pokemon that are no way similar to the other Pokemon.

32:12.320 --> 32:13.320
Buy more games.

32:13.320 --> 32:14.320
All right.

32:14.320 --> 32:15.600
Before you send in the hate mail though.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.320
I was there when the first movie came out in theaters.

32:17.320 --> 32:18.320
I went and saw it opening night.

32:18.320 --> 32:19.320
Okay.

32:19.320 --> 32:20.320
So I think I went with you.

32:20.320 --> 32:21.320
Didn't I?

32:21.320 --> 32:22.320
No, I went Chico.

32:22.320 --> 32:23.320
No, that's right.

32:23.320 --> 32:24.700
Because I, I got the important.

32:24.700 --> 32:27.640
You might've went to the second one with me because I went and saw the second one too.

32:27.640 --> 32:32.280
I saw the third one with you at the theater probably, but I had, but I had to import a

32:32.280 --> 32:36.120
copy of the, of the Japanese one.

32:36.120 --> 32:37.440
So yeah, don't send in the hate mail.

32:37.440 --> 32:38.600
I Pokemon's fine.

32:38.600 --> 32:41.840
I just, I, where are they going to go with it?

32:41.840 --> 32:47.540
It's just, I, if they just make more Pokemon, if they made an MMO, I try it.

32:47.540 --> 32:48.540
I would.

32:48.540 --> 32:49.540
And then they have the record.

32:49.540 --> 32:50.800
I still think Digimon's cooler.

32:50.800 --> 32:52.840
All right, let's get into some gaming news.

32:52.840 --> 32:55.880
We're like what, 30 minutes in the show after a 15 minute late start, we haven't even covered

32:55.880 --> 32:56.880
news yet.

32:56.880 --> 32:59.880
This is going to be a 10 o'clock at night show.

32:59.880 --> 33:00.880
Let's see what happens.

33:00.880 --> 33:01.880
That's 1am for you East coasters.

33:01.880 --> 33:03.640
Let's get started on some gaming news.

33:03.640 --> 33:04.640
Loki.

33:04.640 --> 33:05.640
Okay.

33:05.640 --> 33:10.680
So, um, the ESA did a survey, um, or I shouldn't really say a survey, but they did research

33:10.680 --> 33:14.740
focusing on 200 specific titles during the month of December.

33:14.740 --> 33:18.280
Not necessarily stuff that came out in December, but just during that month.

33:18.280 --> 33:28.640
And it showed that of those 200 titles, there were 9.78 million illegal downloads for those

33:28.640 --> 33:31.400
titles during the month of December.

33:31.400 --> 33:37.200
And the, uh, you might think, okay, well maybe the U.S. is, you know, to blame because there's

33:37.200 --> 33:38.920
a lot of people in the U.S. at pirate.

33:38.920 --> 33:43.200
But actually, no, there's other countries that were a lot higher.

33:43.200 --> 33:50.720
In fact, um, the highest number of unauthorized downloads came from Italy with 20.3% of the

33:50.720 --> 33:51.720
total.

33:51.720 --> 34:00.200
Spain, following that with a 12.5%, France with 7.5% and China with 5.7%.

34:00.200 --> 34:01.200
Interesting.

34:01.200 --> 34:03.200
Now, okay.

34:03.200 --> 34:07.160
I know there might be more to that story, so I apologize for interrupting you, but um,

34:07.160 --> 34:10.880
you know, when I hear the news about the piracy and the numbers, I don't think the, of the

34:10.880 --> 34:11.880
U.S. is number one.

34:11.880 --> 34:15.960
I think a lot of people think, oh, that's all in the U.S. or whatever, but no, I, but

34:15.960 --> 34:17.180
I blame Luxembourg.

34:17.180 --> 34:19.800
The countries I think of are not the ones you're naming.

34:19.800 --> 34:24.440
Like I usually think, you know, because of the stereotypes about being able to buy bootlegs

34:24.440 --> 34:28.800
in Hong Kong, like right on the street corners and you know, knowing of all that that goes

34:28.800 --> 34:31.340
on, I would think it's like Hong Kong, Taiwan.

34:31.340 --> 34:35.360
Those would be the types of places that would be the tops for piracy, but Italy?

34:35.360 --> 34:40.600
Now pardon my ignorance for those overseas listeners, but I've never even been over to

34:40.600 --> 34:41.840
the other side of the Atlantic.

34:41.840 --> 34:42.840
So sorry.

34:42.840 --> 34:46.000
I know we have a lot of listeners over there cause we try to let every gamer have a voice,

34:46.000 --> 34:48.120
including our friends from overseas.

34:48.120 --> 34:52.160
But is there something about Italy where like the distribution that gets to the rest of

34:52.160 --> 34:54.160
Europe doesn't get there or something?

34:54.160 --> 34:55.160
I have no idea.

34:55.160 --> 35:00.060
Um, but they said also that of that, you know, those 10 million, those aren't even really

35:00.060 --> 35:03.400
a full picture of, you know, what's being downloaded.

35:03.400 --> 35:06.540
I think it's just all modern warfare too.

35:06.540 --> 35:07.540
It's probably what it was.

35:07.540 --> 35:11.720
Well, cause my thought is, you know, is that I've gotten into this topic before and I don't

35:11.720 --> 35:16.040
know if it was on a call with Bobby show at the end or if it was on this show, but um,

35:16.040 --> 35:20.960
that I think a lot of this piracy comes from folks that can't get the game through legal

35:20.960 --> 35:23.040
means turn to piracy.

35:23.040 --> 35:27.840
And that's why I kind of question, well, does Italy get game releases when the rest of,

35:27.840 --> 35:29.780
you know, those countries over there get them?

35:29.780 --> 35:34.160
Or is there something about Italy where, and Spain and some of those other countries you

35:34.160 --> 35:38.740
named where they don't get the games at the same time so people turn to piracy?

35:38.740 --> 35:42.920
Like are there laws where maybe the game has to be in a local language like Italian or

35:42.920 --> 35:44.240
Spanish so they can't release them there?

35:44.240 --> 35:45.240
I don't know.

35:45.240 --> 35:46.240
I don't know.

35:46.240 --> 35:51.600
I don't really hear a lot of just, um, you know, I don't really hear of anything being

35:51.600 --> 35:53.480
delayed there, but I mean, I don't really know.

35:53.480 --> 35:57.720
We never hear like, you know, Italy's not getting the game cause it's been censored

35:57.720 --> 35:58.720
or something like that.

35:58.720 --> 36:01.560
It's always Germany or New Zealand or Australia.

36:01.560 --> 36:02.960
They gotta catch them all.

36:02.960 --> 36:06.240
Well, I would love to hear from a listener and you know, cause I know we have some listeners

36:06.240 --> 36:07.240
over there.

36:07.240 --> 36:09.680
If you're listening and you're in one of those countries, Loki named, I would love to get

36:09.680 --> 36:11.240
an email from you.

36:11.240 --> 36:13.760
Why do you think piracy is so rampant where you live?

36:13.760 --> 36:17.640
I mean, is the legal just difficult or expensive or what?

36:17.640 --> 36:20.360
Cause I think, I don't know.

36:20.360 --> 36:22.500
Why do people turn to piracy in the US?

36:22.500 --> 36:25.520
Because they blame the $60 price point of a console game.

36:25.520 --> 36:29.880
You know, I'm, I'm too poor, I'm a, I'm a starving student or whatever it is, you know,

36:29.880 --> 36:35.080
try to justify it with, you know, the whole Robin Hood philosophy of steal from the rich

36:35.080 --> 36:36.120
and give to the poor.

36:36.120 --> 36:38.680
That's what motivates most piracy.

36:38.680 --> 36:41.080
You know, I'm not saying a good thing about that.

36:41.080 --> 36:42.740
I'm just, I'm just saying what I see.

36:42.740 --> 36:43.960
That's just kind of what it seems to be.

36:43.960 --> 36:45.840
It's, it's the whole Robin Hood approach.

36:45.840 --> 36:49.160
So anyhow, uh, well be careful.

36:49.160 --> 36:52.760
I don't think it's as altruistic as Robin Hood's intent.

36:52.760 --> 36:54.880
It's rob from the rich and give to me.

36:54.880 --> 36:55.880
Okay.

36:55.880 --> 36:56.880
Fair enough.

36:56.880 --> 36:57.880
All right.

36:57.880 --> 37:00.600
Well, speaking of piracy, you might want to be a little bit careful if you're into that.

37:00.600 --> 37:04.800
Keep in mind, you know, piracy is not legal, just a reminder, you know, so you are walking

37:04.800 --> 37:06.240
a dangerous line.

37:06.240 --> 37:09.960
Um, so that is evidenced by what's going on in Australia right now.

37:09.960 --> 37:13.480
In fact, when I first read this story, I was like, Oh, what is this?

37:13.480 --> 37:17.080
This is, do we already read about this last week when some pirate got busted in Australia?

37:17.080 --> 37:19.040
No, this is something else.

37:19.040 --> 37:24.560
Nintendo is actually managed to win a case against the R4 mod cartridge for the DS.

37:24.560 --> 37:28.400
What happened is that Nintendo actually won a lawsuit against, uh, the Australian distributor

37:28.400 --> 37:29.400
of the R4.

37:29.400 --> 37:31.880
Uh, this is coming from the news lines in Australia.

37:31.880 --> 37:37.320
Uh, apparently gadget gear.com.au cause all the Australian ones in today, you, they were

37:37.320 --> 37:39.560
actually told they have to stop selling the device.

37:39.560 --> 37:47.320
They got fined the equivalent of $466,000, uh, the folks that were named in the suit,

37:47.320 --> 37:52.400
Patrick Lee and James Lee, I guess they also kind of sold this independently, not through

37:52.400 --> 37:53.400
the same site.

37:53.400 --> 37:57.760
Uh, but they also were fined $100,000 Australian.

37:57.760 --> 37:59.920
That's about 90,000 here.

37:59.920 --> 38:02.960
Also what I think is interesting is part of the settlement or I'm sorry, not settlement,

38:02.960 --> 38:03.960
but suit.

38:03.960 --> 38:07.400
Uh, they have to disclose who is supplying the R4 chips.

38:07.400 --> 38:08.400
Hmm.

38:08.400 --> 38:13.640
So that again is just, that's the second in like a week's time of Nintendo winning some

38:13.640 --> 38:14.640
anti-piracy.

38:14.640 --> 38:15.640
I think it's dumb.

38:15.640 --> 38:21.680
The, you know, I mean those chips, I understand that they can be used for piracy, but a computer

38:21.680 --> 38:23.020
can be used for piracy.

38:23.020 --> 38:26.320
So yeah, we're going to make computers legal now too.

38:26.320 --> 38:31.160
I mean it's just, you have to go after the, sadly enough, you have to go after the people

38:31.160 --> 38:35.080
that are using the pirate stuff or I don't know, here's a thought.

38:35.080 --> 38:37.120
Go after people putting ROMs online.

38:37.120 --> 38:43.000
It won't matter if you have the stupid chip for your DS because it won't work with anything.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.060
There's no fucking ROMs out there.

38:46.060 --> 38:50.600
Oddly enough, I kind of agree with you and I think your computer analogy, you know, even

38:50.600 --> 38:55.120
though I don't own an R4 and I don't think I would get into all this stuff, I have two

38:55.120 --> 38:56.120
and a G3.

38:56.120 --> 38:58.200
I have two Ninja passes.

38:58.200 --> 39:03.560
I think, okay, I think, you know, I, I'm, I feel like I'm too stupid to really get into

39:03.560 --> 39:04.560
all that stuff.

39:04.560 --> 39:07.760
I don't know what it is, but I think if I had one, I'd want to play like homebrew stuff

39:07.760 --> 39:10.040
on it is probably what I would be into.

39:10.040 --> 39:13.760
You know, I, I like having the real deal because then I know I'm going to get online and not

39:13.760 --> 39:16.560
get my system bricked and you know, all of that, like I'm willing to pay the extra money

39:16.560 --> 39:19.880
just for ease of mind in that regard.

39:19.880 --> 39:25.320
But as far as like the R4 stuff goes, I think when you buy a device like that, yeah, I should

39:25.320 --> 39:28.960
be able to use the parts for whatever I want.

39:28.960 --> 39:31.580
As long as I'm not stealing, I get the problem with piracy.

39:31.580 --> 39:35.880
You're stealing someone else's property like, you know, that they spent money to create

39:35.880 --> 39:36.880
the wrong people.

39:36.880 --> 39:42.120
But if somebody wants to put a free ROM on the internet for their free public domain,

39:42.120 --> 39:45.840
just like somebody puts their music up on MySpace, they want you to download it and

39:45.840 --> 39:48.280
listen to it to get their band name out there.

39:48.280 --> 39:54.260
It's just like people, it'd be going after, it'd be like going after somebody, um, or

39:54.260 --> 40:00.120
a camcorder company because somebody used it to pirate a film.

40:00.120 --> 40:06.120
You can't do that just because it's a device that allows you to run unauthorized stuff.

40:06.120 --> 40:10.560
I guess they could just, you know, stop the, you know, ban them from manufacturing it or

40:10.560 --> 40:11.760
they could try.

40:11.760 --> 40:15.120
But if it's unauthorized in the first place and there's not a lot you can do to lock it

40:15.120 --> 40:20.520
out since they can't really update the hardware to do that, um, via firmware or anything.

40:20.520 --> 40:28.080
But um, I don't know, I mean it, there are a lot of legitimate uses for it besides piracy.

40:28.080 --> 40:33.520
For the record, I haven't used mine to play anything in months because I just don't care

40:33.520 --> 40:34.520
anymore.

40:34.520 --> 40:36.160
I have to admit, I'm kind of in the same boat.

40:36.160 --> 40:39.480
Like even when I was moving this weekend, I found just like tons and tons of DS and

40:39.480 --> 40:40.480
PSP games.

40:40.480 --> 40:44.320
I'm like, I don't even remember the last time I touched these cause, but if you've listened

40:44.320 --> 40:47.400
to the show before, you know, I have this weird thing against handheld gaming.

40:47.400 --> 40:50.280
Like I just can't, games are meant for my television.

40:50.280 --> 40:52.280
Like I can't play them sitting there.

40:52.280 --> 40:58.760
I feel, I don't know, dirty, not dirty, and there's been some really good handheld games

40:58.760 --> 40:59.760
too.

40:59.760 --> 41:02.720
Like Final Fantasy four on the DS loved it, you know, and yeah, there's non Final Fantasy

41:02.720 --> 41:03.720
games too, you know?

41:03.720 --> 41:10.400
Well, I, the last thing I was playing was, um, the Zelda, um, spirit tracks, but I even

41:10.400 --> 41:12.040
got bored of that.

41:12.040 --> 41:14.000
I shouldn't be getting bored of a Zelda game.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.500
I mean, come on, it's Zelda, it's awesome.

41:17.500 --> 41:23.200
Do you think maybe your expectations have kind of no, but they didn't really do that

41:23.200 --> 41:28.120
much different other than look now, now links right in a train instead of a boat.

41:28.120 --> 41:29.760
I mean, it's the same damn game.

41:29.760 --> 41:30.760
Okay.

41:30.760 --> 41:33.660
I'm going to take the tangent train for a minute here, but like we kind of got into

41:33.660 --> 41:34.920
it a couple of weeks ago on the show.

41:34.920 --> 41:39.200
I remember talking about game room and some of these old arcade games and Atari 2,600

41:39.200 --> 41:42.580
games and some folks saying that, you know, they're repetitive, they're boring.

41:42.580 --> 41:46.500
And I'm thinking that's what it was all about back when you know, those games first came

41:46.500 --> 41:47.500
out.

41:47.500 --> 41:48.500
What's wrong with you?

41:48.500 --> 41:53.320
You know, like, are we just, have our expectations about what makes a good game like changed

41:53.320 --> 41:54.320
in that regard?

41:54.320 --> 41:58.480
I guess they have to some extent, you know, it would be like this.

41:58.480 --> 42:04.300
It would be like saying, okay, um, I'm playing Pac-Man Pac-Man's cool.

42:04.300 --> 42:07.820
And then we come out with Pac-Man two, which is exactly the same as Pac-Man one, except

42:07.820 --> 42:11.720
now the screen is blue and purple instead of like yellow and blue.

42:11.720 --> 42:16.480
That's basically the difference between, you know, Ms. Pac-Man, but she has a bone.

42:16.480 --> 42:21.480
She has a bow and you know, it's slightly different, but no, seriously, it's, it's almost

42:21.480 --> 42:25.240
like they've said, okay, well, what can we do to put the least amount of effort into

42:25.240 --> 42:28.340
this so we can release a sequel really quick?

42:28.340 --> 42:29.340
And yes, I understand.

42:29.340 --> 42:33.880
Ooh, it's, I mean, they don't even try to tie any of the games storyline wise together.

42:33.880 --> 42:40.480
Oh yes, it's another adventurer who happens to look the same as Link and his name is Link.

42:40.480 --> 42:44.880
And now, uh, he has got to go rescue this Princess Zelda, who's not the same Princess

42:44.880 --> 42:47.940
Zelda, even though she looked exactly the same as the last game.

42:47.940 --> 42:50.700
Don't they do that in all the Zelda games?

42:50.700 --> 42:54.340
Like aren't all the links like different links, but there could, I mean, sometimes they're

42:54.340 --> 42:56.400
the same link depending on what game you're playing.

42:56.400 --> 42:59.520
It's just, it's, it's lazy is what it is.

42:59.520 --> 43:01.580
It's like, oh, let's, I thought that's why the name was Link.

43:01.580 --> 43:05.860
Cause they're all linked from my just dumb.

43:05.860 --> 43:07.500
I don't think that's why.

43:07.500 --> 43:09.500
All right, fine.

43:09.500 --> 43:13.860
All right, let's move on with some other gaming news before I take the tangent train somewhere

43:13.860 --> 43:14.860
else.

43:14.860 --> 43:16.700
Do you have a news story to save us here a little bit?

43:16.700 --> 43:17.700
I do.

43:17.700 --> 43:19.580
I'm, I'm tangled up in yarn.

43:19.580 --> 43:20.580
No.

43:20.580 --> 43:29.660
Um, there is a bit more about, uh, EA, um, servers being a big clank putting on them.

43:29.660 --> 43:37.260
On March 16th, we have, um, service shut down for death jam for PS3, Godfather for PS3 and

43:37.260 --> 43:44.140
Xbox 360, Lord of the Rings conquest, Mercenaries 2, need for speed carbon on portable, um,

43:44.140 --> 43:50.460
need for speed, um, pro street PSP, Simpsons, um, for PlayStation three and Xbox 360, April

43:50.460 --> 43:56.420
15th, burnout three take down, um, army of two for PS3, but that's only in Asia.

43:56.420 --> 44:03.100
And then, um, of course we have a ton of original Xbox being shut down after that and PS2 games.

44:03.100 --> 44:10.060
So yeah, a lot, uh, pretty much everything that's Xbox PS2 earlier and, um, tiger woods.

44:10.060 --> 44:11.060
So,

44:11.060 --> 44:15.380
you know, I'm surprised that, uh, I mean, there's some of the games on there like Simpsons.

44:15.380 --> 44:18.580
I don't remember there being online for that.

44:18.580 --> 44:23.300
Um, it was funny though, cause even like a Def Jam icon, that was one of those kids.

44:23.300 --> 44:24.300
Oh yeah.

44:24.300 --> 44:26.260
You can put your music in there and you know, play and stuff.

44:26.260 --> 44:27.260
I'm like, Oh yeah.

44:27.260 --> 44:30.780
If we put some weird like DDR music in there, that'd be really funny.

44:30.780 --> 44:32.780
Cause it's meant for more like hip hop stuff.

44:32.780 --> 44:33.780
Yeah.

44:33.780 --> 44:34.780
Oh well.

44:34.780 --> 44:35.780
No.

44:35.780 --> 44:38.300
Well, you know, and it's not really surprising.

44:38.300 --> 44:44.980
I mean, it costs money to run the servers and if they're not making any more money on

44:44.980 --> 44:49.140
these games and you know, new stuff's going to be coming out, what's the point of keeping

44:49.140 --> 44:50.140
it around?

44:50.140 --> 44:51.140
Yeah.

44:51.140 --> 44:53.180
Well, there's a lot of companies out there that don't really have these servers that

44:53.180 --> 44:54.180
they shut down.

44:54.180 --> 44:57.620
I mean, um, really EA is the main one we hear about every now and then.

44:57.620 --> 45:04.540
Um, and then I think we had one from Sega when they shut down the server for Chrome

45:04.540 --> 45:10.540
hounds, but I mean, those are the only ones I've heard of for like a while.

45:10.540 --> 45:11.540
So I don't know.

45:11.540 --> 45:12.540
That's kind of interesting.

45:12.540 --> 45:18.820
Well, and you know, Xbox original getting shut down is, you know, somewhat notable,

45:18.820 --> 45:22.640
you know, just, but that's just, that's just a matter of time.

45:22.640 --> 45:26.780
But I don't understand like current generation stuff, the servers being shut down for them.

45:26.780 --> 45:29.020
I mean, that's just kind of weird.

45:29.020 --> 45:33.220
I can understand like, you know, okay, yeah, we're moving on to the PlayStation four, you

45:33.220 --> 45:36.540
know, the PlayStation network for PlayStation three is going to have to go away and keep

45:36.540 --> 45:43.140
in mind also looking again, economy wise, you know, a lot of companies are losing money

45:43.140 --> 45:44.140
anyway.

45:44.140 --> 45:47.620
If they're trying to mitigate, I fully believe that it's just, it's to mitigate cost.

45:47.620 --> 45:48.620
I really do.

45:48.620 --> 45:49.620
I think that's part of it too.

45:49.620 --> 45:55.020
And Loki, as you said earlier, you play what grand theft auto and nobody's ever online.

45:55.020 --> 45:57.380
I'm kind of surprised they're not threatening to pull the plug on that.

45:57.380 --> 46:00.420
If people aren't using it, it's costing them to keep the they are just, they're not playing

46:00.420 --> 46:01.420
what I'm playing.

46:01.420 --> 46:02.420
I see.

46:02.420 --> 46:07.380
I mean, specific settings, um, cause we play with auto aim off and some newbie players

46:07.380 --> 46:11.860
out there like play with auto aim on and that would be me.

46:11.860 --> 46:17.660
And uh, so because of that, anybody is searching for a game with auto aim on, they're only

46:17.660 --> 46:19.220
going to find auto aim on games.

46:19.220 --> 46:20.940
So you have to specify that.

46:20.940 --> 46:24.080
But I mean, how many people are really playing like Godfather online anymore?

46:24.080 --> 46:25.080
You know, it's probably really hard.

46:25.080 --> 46:29.080
Probably not that many people like, I mean, put it this way, like for like validate Tony

46:29.080 --> 46:33.020
right now, which is one of the expansions, but most people are playing the vanilla grand

46:33.020 --> 46:34.020
theft auto stuff.

46:34.020 --> 46:38.260
I mean, so I'm sure there's, you know, hundreds of thousands of people online for, um, the

46:38.260 --> 46:39.260
battle of gay Tony.

46:39.260 --> 46:42.940
There's at least 50,000 people on the ranked leaderboards, um, right now.

46:42.940 --> 46:46.180
So um, there's a lot of people out there.

46:46.180 --> 46:51.380
It's just, you know, whether they may be wanting to play just free mode or just, you know,

46:51.380 --> 46:58.140
some other, you know, death match, non ranked, you know, team death match, who knows?

46:58.140 --> 46:59.140
All right.

46:59.140 --> 47:00.940
Uh, chat dot orange lounge, radio.com.

47:00.940 --> 47:04.700
If you want to join us, uh, X-link reminds us they've also shut down the servers for

47:04.700 --> 47:07.460
the PS two and PC versions of fantasy star universe.

47:07.460 --> 47:09.380
That was another big recent one.

47:09.380 --> 47:13.180
Fantasy star universe is starting to disappear, which is a pretty big deal, but yeah, I'm

47:13.180 --> 47:14.180
not kind of not surprised.

47:14.180 --> 47:17.280
A lot of the communities on X-Box three 60 cause wasn't that the only way you had the

47:17.280 --> 47:19.900
voice enabled in it too, maybe.

47:19.900 --> 47:20.900
Yeah.

47:20.900 --> 47:25.260
So, well of course you could always use something like ventrilo or something on the PC, I suppose.

47:25.260 --> 47:26.960
Well let's move on.

47:26.960 --> 47:31.500
So one thing that would suck if the server shut down for it would be, um, Ubisoft's new

47:31.500 --> 47:33.380
PC DRM servers.

47:33.380 --> 47:38.020
Um, apparently of course they revealed the plan back in January that they're going to

47:38.020 --> 47:44.000
streamline their DM DRM process across all PC titles by making players log into Ubisoft

47:44.000 --> 47:47.040
servers to authenticate before playing.

47:47.040 --> 47:52.980
Now that doesn't sound too bad right now, but there's a few things of course you have

47:52.980 --> 47:54.400
to understand.

47:54.400 --> 48:00.540
It's um, the system is kind of flawed and the reason being is for example, if your connection

48:00.540 --> 48:05.660
experiences any sort of issue, uh, you know, whether it be like, you know, dropping bandwidth

48:05.660 --> 48:11.220
or momentary pause, router reboot or whatever, the software will immediately boot you out

48:11.220 --> 48:17.020
of your game back to the main menu and you'll lose all your progress until, you know, up

48:17.020 --> 48:19.460
to the previous save.

48:19.460 --> 48:21.940
And um, that's it.

48:21.940 --> 48:27.980
So, um, if Ubisoft's master servers encounter any errors, then all the players with a working

48:27.980 --> 48:32.080
connection logged into the servers will not be able to play their games until the servers

48:32.080 --> 48:33.080
are back online.

48:33.080 --> 48:38.260
Oh gee, Ubisoft's customer support isn't about to blow up or anything.

48:38.260 --> 48:43.100
So you know, um, doesn't Ubisoft make the like imagine games?

48:43.100 --> 48:44.100
Yes they do.

48:44.100 --> 48:45.100
Okay.

48:45.100 --> 48:47.580
So I imagine there's equivalents of that on the PC, right?

48:47.580 --> 48:51.260
Well the main, the two titles that are going to be coming up, and this is according to

48:51.260 --> 48:57.940
PC gaming, they tested the two upcoming titles, um, Assassin's Creed 2 and Settlers 7.

48:57.940 --> 49:02.780
I don't think they have any imagine games for a PC, but they would have this DRM if

49:02.780 --> 49:03.780
they did.

49:03.780 --> 49:04.780
And that's where I'm going with this.

49:04.780 --> 49:09.800
And you know, not everybody that would be buying a game like that is tech savvy enough

49:09.800 --> 49:12.540
to understand what DRM even is.

49:12.540 --> 49:16.580
You know, certainly not, the type of people that buy those imagine games are probably

49:16.580 --> 49:19.460
not the same people that listen to this podcast unless of course they're buying it for their

49:19.460 --> 49:20.460
kids.

49:20.460 --> 49:26.980
You know, my point is, you're going to have these, uh, moms buying it for their daughters

49:26.980 --> 49:31.860
and you know, people that don't really follow gaming or understand what DRM even is that

49:31.860 --> 49:33.860
just know the game isn't going to fire up on the computer.

49:33.860 --> 49:35.460
Who's going to get the phone call about that?

49:35.460 --> 49:39.700
The phone calls are going to go to Ubisoft or they're going to go to targets and Walmarts

49:39.700 --> 49:41.100
across the country.

49:41.100 --> 49:44.820
And when that starts happening, they're going to stop carrying it.

49:44.820 --> 49:45.820
Exactly.

49:45.820 --> 49:52.220
Um, I have a feeling, um, that this will be cracked in probably a few days.

49:52.220 --> 49:56.660
Well, usually those types of things are, and people are going to turn to that and sadly

49:56.660 --> 49:58.020
it what's going to end up happening.

49:58.020 --> 50:04.580
But unfortunately, soccer mom Jones who buys this for her daughter, you'll imagine, I don't

50:04.580 --> 50:06.780
know, dress up shop or whatever they come out with.

50:06.780 --> 50:07.980
How many of those imagine games are there?

50:07.980 --> 50:09.380
We were a target last too many.

50:09.380 --> 50:12.740
How many of those imagine games were there on the shelf, Alan, like, like 5,000, right?

50:12.740 --> 50:13.740
At least a dozen.

50:13.740 --> 50:14.740
Yeah.

50:14.740 --> 50:21.420
I just caught your eye right next to cooking mama one, two, three, and gardening mama.

50:21.420 --> 50:28.700
And you know, it's just everything crazy anyhow, uh, while we're talking about online authentication,

50:28.700 --> 50:30.260
I think this is kind of interesting.

50:30.260 --> 50:33.060
It's almost like a combination of the past couple of stories we've been hearing about,

50:33.060 --> 50:39.280
you know, server costs to maintain as well as a little bit about the, uh, DRM, um, so

50:39.280 --> 50:41.980
come fire team Bravo three.

50:41.980 --> 50:46.500
If you are going to be playing this game on the PSP, you're going to get a code so that

50:46.500 --> 50:50.620
you can go and redeem it on the PlayStation network and you'll be able to access the game

50:50.620 --> 50:51.620
online.

50:51.620 --> 50:56.340
But if you don't buy this game either directly through PSN because it will automatically

50:56.340 --> 51:02.260
be enabled or you get the code new, you will have to shell out $20 to get the license to

51:02.260 --> 51:03.820
let you play online.

51:03.820 --> 51:04.940
Think about that for a minute.

51:04.940 --> 51:08.780
What that basically means is they're kind of targeting people who are going after this

51:08.780 --> 51:12.340
used or the people who buy this second hand, because think about it.

51:12.340 --> 51:14.320
If you buy it new, you'll get a code.

51:14.320 --> 51:17.280
If you buy it online, you don't need a code cause you bought it online.

51:17.280 --> 51:19.900
But if you buy it used, no code for you.

51:19.900 --> 51:22.380
Well, it's for piracy really.

51:22.380 --> 51:26.260
You think that's part of it or you think it's, that's what they're targeting it for.

51:26.260 --> 51:27.260
I see.

51:27.260 --> 51:28.260
So $20 to be able to actually play.

51:28.260 --> 51:30.500
You know what I hear the funniest part about though.

51:30.500 --> 51:34.260
Wouldn't they be, what wouldn't a pirated game not be able to go online to get authenticated

51:34.260 --> 51:35.260
though?

51:35.260 --> 51:36.540
No, it can, it can go online.

51:36.540 --> 51:40.700
Interesting because pirated games, basically they act like just installed games, but here's

51:40.700 --> 51:44.260
the, here's the best part.

51:44.260 --> 51:48.260
Sony actually has a workaround for it in their own system.

51:48.260 --> 51:53.360
And the reason this is, can grant it, you can't play online games, but thanks to that

51:53.360 --> 51:56.420
wonderful and I don't remember what the hell it's called now, but remember how you can

51:56.420 --> 52:00.380
do ad hoc over the internet with Sony PlayStation three?

52:00.380 --> 52:04.660
Well, guess I don't need to go online to play other people online.

52:04.660 --> 52:09.180
I can just go ad hoc over the internet and it works just fine.

52:09.180 --> 52:10.380
It's not lag city or anything.

52:10.380 --> 52:12.020
No, it shouldn't be.

52:12.020 --> 52:13.020
Interesting.

52:13.020 --> 52:17.560
By the way, uh, John color from Sony actually, I was quoted to IGN saying it's quote a trial

52:17.560 --> 52:20.900
run for a new initiative we are exploring for the platform.

52:20.900 --> 52:25.620
So even if you're like, ah, fuck it, I don't play SOCOM, uh, this could still be in the

52:25.620 --> 52:27.580
future impacting a game you play.

52:27.580 --> 52:33.660
They're waiting to see how long it's cracked and it probably will get cracked somehow.

52:33.660 --> 52:36.180
They don't think they use thing has anything to do with it.

52:36.180 --> 52:38.180
Oh, I'm sure that it has a little bit to do with it.

52:38.180 --> 52:42.740
That's why they also were testing out the market with, um, like member local, not local

52:42.740 --> 52:49.940
record to, um, pot upon two, I think where they had the game in a retail box, but all

52:49.940 --> 52:52.020
it was was a card with a scratch off.

52:52.020 --> 52:53.020
Oh yeah.

52:53.020 --> 52:54.020
And I saw that at fries.

52:54.020 --> 52:55.020
Yeah.

52:55.020 --> 52:56.020
You know, so that's another thing.

52:56.020 --> 52:57.300
They were test marketing.

52:57.300 --> 53:02.140
So I'm just thinking if I were to pick up this game used, I'd be kind of irritated that

53:02.140 --> 53:04.220
I have to go online and pay another $20.

53:04.220 --> 53:07.540
Like again, here we go with the angry phone calls from people who don't know better to

53:07.540 --> 53:09.180
this time GameStop.

53:09.180 --> 53:13.180
And if I were GameStop, you know, and you can use that term loosely to describe whatever

53:13.180 --> 53:16.520
game store makes their bread and butter off of used games and happens to sell new games

53:16.520 --> 53:17.520
as well.

53:17.520 --> 53:18.520
I'd be kind of pissed.

53:18.520 --> 53:23.580
And I would like, can you imagine, especially with such a powerhouse that GameStop is, and

53:23.580 --> 53:27.380
we'll just throw in all the other, you know, like companies in there, okay.

53:27.380 --> 53:32.060
Like the powerhouse that they are with something like this kind of going after their used market,

53:32.060 --> 53:35.740
can you imagine if they were to say, and they have the power to do this, they run a magazine

53:35.740 --> 53:36.980
for heaven's sake.

53:36.980 --> 53:39.020
They could discourage people from buying the game.

53:39.020 --> 53:40.020
Think about it.

53:40.020 --> 53:41.020
What's to stop.

53:41.020 --> 53:45.640
I mean, this, this might be a little conspiracy theory here, but what's to stop GameStop from

53:45.640 --> 53:50.560
publishing a negative review in this game in Game Informer, which is the most popular

53:50.560 --> 53:54.820
video game magazine out there that happens to be run by GameStop to discourage people

53:54.820 --> 53:57.980
from buying this game for no other reason than it cuts into the used game market.

53:57.980 --> 54:01.280
But yet they use this whole, they're going to get to with the $20 thing.

54:01.280 --> 54:02.280
It's the reason.

54:02.280 --> 54:06.240
But the real reason is the bottom line of the game stores because they need the advertising

54:06.240 --> 54:11.020
dollars that are provided by Sony to be able to run their magazine.

54:11.020 --> 54:15.740
But the same thing though, they could basically discourage people from, you know, buying the

54:15.740 --> 54:21.820
game without writing a negative review and use the employees letting people know.

54:21.820 --> 54:27.520
But I would think at the same time that this could be bad for Sony anyways, because when

54:27.520 --> 54:32.160
a competing game comes out there, let's see, am I going to buy the game that won't let

54:32.160 --> 54:36.760
me play online unless I pay $20 or the other game that's equally cool that I can play online

54:36.760 --> 54:37.760
for free?

54:37.760 --> 54:38.760
Hmm.

54:38.760 --> 54:39.760
That's a tough one.

54:39.760 --> 54:43.200
I will go with the free one.

54:43.200 --> 54:44.200
Let's see.

54:44.200 --> 54:45.200
Tiger Claw in our chat room.

54:45.200 --> 54:49.160
chat.orangeslaungeradio.com says, I wonder what if Sony sells this game in twos?

54:49.160 --> 54:53.120
For example, what if you want to only buy the multiplayer part, couldn't you just purchase

54:53.120 --> 54:57.240
the multiplayer game itself and not the full single player?

54:57.240 --> 55:01.000
And here's the problem too with the SOCOM 3.

55:01.000 --> 55:04.300
It's not a discounted game.

55:04.300 --> 55:06.680
It's a full price game.

55:06.680 --> 55:11.560
So it's not like, hey, we're selling this for 20 bucks, but you know, if you want to

55:11.560 --> 55:17.000
go online to pay the other 20 and then, you know, equal the cost of a full price game.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.580
No, it's nothing like that where they're offering a discount.

55:19.580 --> 55:22.920
It's a full price game and then you have to pay another $20 on top of it.

55:22.920 --> 55:25.480
Well, you know what I say, if you don't like it, don't buy it.

55:25.480 --> 55:26.480
End of story.

55:26.480 --> 55:28.040
I mean, that's really what it is.

55:28.040 --> 55:29.040
If you don't like it, don't buy it.

55:29.040 --> 55:32.280
But I mean, a game like this SOCOM has its fan base.

55:32.280 --> 55:33.280
This is good.

55:33.280 --> 55:35.360
There's people that aren't even going to bat an eye at this because they already are going

55:35.360 --> 55:36.960
to buy the game new.

55:36.960 --> 55:37.960
They'll find a way.

55:37.960 --> 55:40.520
No, we'll see what happens.

55:40.520 --> 55:41.520
Let's move on with some more stories.

55:41.520 --> 55:44.200
We've got release dates coming up as well as the classic game of the week and a little

55:44.200 --> 55:46.080
bit here on Orange Lounge Radio.

55:46.080 --> 55:48.720
Well, this is some good news.

55:48.720 --> 55:49.720
How about something happy?

55:49.720 --> 55:50.720
Yay.

55:50.720 --> 55:51.720
Happy.

55:51.720 --> 55:52.720
It looks happy for me because I'm playing it.

55:52.720 --> 55:53.720
You're going to give me money?

55:53.720 --> 55:54.720
Yay.

55:54.720 --> 55:55.720
I'm not playing that game.

55:55.720 --> 55:56.720
I'm not playing that game.

55:56.720 --> 55:57.720
I'm not playing that game.

55:57.720 --> 55:58.720
Star Trek.

55:58.720 --> 55:59.720
Star Trek Online.

55:59.720 --> 56:05.520
They are actually working on ways of opening up the ship so that you can explore more of

56:05.520 --> 56:06.520
your own ship.

56:06.520 --> 56:10.440
You know, so far, all you can do is go hang out on the bridge and that's kind of boring.

56:10.440 --> 56:16.880
You know, I look at my Andorian dude just, you know, piloting, I'm like, okay, he's piloting.

56:16.880 --> 56:22.160
And I can sit in my captain's chair, ooh, but you can't really do much.

56:22.160 --> 56:26.720
I mean, you can invite people there, but I would really like to, I even think it would

56:26.720 --> 56:30.960
be cool to have like, you know, in ship missions, you know, that would be cool.

56:30.960 --> 56:34.040
You know, you have to fight the Borg in the middle of your ship or something.

56:34.040 --> 56:35.040
Oh, like first contact.

56:35.040 --> 56:36.040
Yeah.

56:36.040 --> 56:38.160
By the way, I thought you said happy news, not nerdy news.

56:38.160 --> 56:39.160
It is happy news.

56:39.160 --> 56:40.160
I'm just kidding.

56:40.160 --> 56:46.040
I said it was happy for me, but, um, they basically want to make it more, you know,

56:46.040 --> 56:50.560
do what they can to make it more like actual Star Trek.

56:50.560 --> 56:53.880
And this is something that they've quoted as saying that it's something that they want

56:53.880 --> 56:58.120
to do, but they're not going to implement it until they have it working flawlessly.

56:58.120 --> 57:01.200
Well of course, you don't want, especially with an MMO, you'll piss off your user base

57:01.200 --> 57:03.000
if you roll out something that's all flawed.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.040
I want a holodeck.

57:04.040 --> 57:05.680
Would I be able to, a holodeck would be cool.

57:05.680 --> 57:08.880
Would I also be able to walk around the ship and demand that people bow down before me

57:08.880 --> 57:11.760
or I'll shoot to kill?

57:11.760 --> 57:12.760
No.

57:12.760 --> 57:17.720
However, um, I get, I bet if you're, you know, I see, I think it would be cool if you could

57:17.720 --> 57:20.560
actually, you know, do like rank things going up through your ship too.

57:20.560 --> 57:24.600
But then that means you're, if you're on the Klingon ship and you do something your subordinates

57:24.600 --> 57:28.920
think is cowardly, they can challenge you to a doodle of death.

57:28.920 --> 57:29.920
Interesting.

57:29.920 --> 57:33.000
Well, at least that's how it works on a Klingon ship.

57:33.000 --> 57:36.000
I want to change my music and have Klingon opera playing in the background on my Klingon

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
ship.

57:37.000 --> 57:40.200
I think you should have a, there's Klingons on the starboard bow, starboard bow, starboard

57:40.200 --> 57:43.460
bow.

57:43.460 --> 57:45.320
That was nerdier than what I said.

57:45.320 --> 57:46.320
Okay.

57:46.320 --> 57:47.320
Touche.

57:47.320 --> 57:48.320
All right.

57:48.320 --> 57:51.240
We're going to travel around the world now and check out some release dates and some

57:51.240 --> 57:53.560
things coming to a store near you.

57:53.560 --> 57:54.560
Yes.

57:54.560 --> 57:57.080
This week I actually got some pretty cool stuff coming out.

57:57.080 --> 58:02.200
I'm starting off with Endless Ocean Blue World coming out on the Nintendo Wii.

58:02.200 --> 58:06.140
You can also find that with a bundle with Wii Speak because yes, you can play this game

58:06.140 --> 58:10.160
online and talk to each other while you're under the sea.

58:10.160 --> 58:16.880
On Xbox 360 Risen, the ever delayed game now coming out on Xbox 360 and I believe the PC

58:16.880 --> 58:20.000
version came out last October.

58:20.000 --> 58:25.000
Lovely Lisa and Friends on the DS apparently from the Tommy Corporation.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.080
I believe it's a doll that's actually in Japan.

58:27.080 --> 58:29.480
Why this is being brought out over here is beyond me.

58:29.480 --> 58:30.520
Because she's lovely.

58:30.520 --> 58:32.520
I guess.

58:32.520 --> 58:42.360
Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii DS and PSP.

58:42.360 --> 58:46.920
And of course that's going to feature all your favorite Sonic characters or Sega characters

58:46.920 --> 58:53.600
and Banjo-Kazooie of course in the Xbox 360 version.

58:53.600 --> 58:57.320
See here.

58:57.320 --> 58:59.600
Hello Kitty Birthday Adventures on DS.

58:59.600 --> 59:00.600
Yippee.

59:00.600 --> 59:01.600
Yeah.

59:01.600 --> 59:02.640
I know.

59:02.640 --> 59:06.760
Napoleon Total War coming out on PC.

59:06.760 --> 59:10.320
Pony Friends 2 coming out on DS.

59:10.320 --> 59:13.200
Anything our listeners might actually want to buy?

59:13.200 --> 59:14.200
What are you saying?

59:14.200 --> 59:15.680
Pony Friends 2 is not on the top of their list?

59:15.680 --> 59:17.560
You know, I'm thinking no.

59:17.560 --> 59:20.000
Well that's too bad.

59:20.000 --> 59:23.960
Heavy Rain coming out on PlayStation 3 this week as well.

59:23.960 --> 59:29.880
And then, let's see, wrapping it up, Deck of Sports on DS.

59:29.880 --> 59:34.240
Oh, Deck of Sports was the one that had curling in it, right?

59:34.240 --> 59:37.880
Yes, I'm not sure if the DS version has curling in it.

59:37.880 --> 59:40.640
I love Winter Olympics time of year.

59:40.640 --> 59:43.400
But I know they have a bunch of other stuff in there.

59:43.400 --> 59:46.720
I think it's maybe new sports in the DS version.

59:46.720 --> 59:50.560
Of course, it's not going to let me see it, so.

59:50.560 --> 59:51.560
Oh well.

59:51.560 --> 59:55.200
Alright, well should I travel over to Japan and take a look at the releases over there?

59:55.200 --> 59:56.200
Sure.

59:56.200 --> 59:57.200
Alright.

59:57.200 --> 59:58.200
Hi.

59:58.200 --> 01:00:02.200
Coming out on February 25th on the Xbox 360, a localized version of Borderlands comes out

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:03.640
from 2K Games.

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:10.000
Also a game called Espgaluda 2, a black label comes out in the limited edition and regular

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
formats.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Of course, there's a 2 there.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
It is the sequel to Espgaluda.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.160
And if you've never heard of it, that's because it's a shmup, it's a shoot-em-up.

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:21.280
Very colorful, seizure-inducing graphics where most of your screen is taken up with an overlay

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.800
because it's a vertical shooter.

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:28.800
But you know there are some hardcore shmup fans out there, so I'm sure they'll be picking

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:31.340
this up without delay.

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:36.320
Also no fate, only the power of will comes out from Alchemist on February 25th on the

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:37.320
Xbox 360.

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:38.480
Not sure what this game's all about.

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:43.060
Of course, it's got anime girls all over it, but this chick who's getting out of the pool

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:44.060
is kind of angry.

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:45.480
I don't know why she's so angry.

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:46.480
She's getting out of the pool there.

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:47.480
She looks like Utena.

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:48.480
It's an adventure game.

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:49.960
And then this other chick's just dreaming.

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:53.040
But I like to think that maybe she is looking at the chick getting out of the pool and that's

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:54.040
just making her angry.

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:55.040
I don't know.

01:00:55.040 --> 01:01:00.760
Anyhow, that made for a much funnier in-studio than it did radio, I apologize for that.

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:01.760
Moving on.

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:02.760
I snorted my root beer if that makes you feel better.

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:03.760
It does, a little bit.

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:06.440
And there is no curling in Deck of Sports DS.

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:07.560
Fail.

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:09.360
A million times fail.

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:11.960
PlayStation 3, a price reduction on Demon's Souls.

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:14.160
If you haven't picked that up yet, you really should.

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:15.160
It's awesome.

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:17.280
That's pretty much the only thing to look forward to on PlayStation 3 unless you need

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:21.600
like some new HDMI cables because some third parties are putting some more of those out.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.440
But the Nintendo Wii has a lot this week, which is good because they've had some quiet

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:28.480
weeks lately, including Arc Rise Fantasia is coming out.

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:32.440
Ina no Susume selection, I think that might be just a price reduction then.

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:35.040
I think, yeah, Arc Rise Fantasia I think has already been out.

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:36.140
Just a price reduction there.

01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:38.040
It's kind of like a best hits over there.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:42.200
As far as new games go, Raji Ronnojia Wii.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:45.080
That's the sequel to Radarji.

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:47.160
I don't know if I'm even saying that right.

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:48.160
Radarji.

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.160
Radarji.

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:51.220
There's like an extra R in here.

01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:53.800
Another shmup basically, but this time on the Wii.

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:55.760
Radio Allergy as it's called over here.

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:59.320
Well the big thing about this one is that the final boss from the last game will now

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:01.440
be a PC in this game.

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.960
So you have shields and all that stuff.

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:07.080
Co-op mode and lots of fun things for a shmup game.

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:10.280
That again is on the Nintendo Wii.

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:12.440
Checking out some other systems on the DS.

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:18.280
Estpolis, The Lands Cursed by the Gods is coming out as well as Fushigi no Dungeon,

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:22.320
Furai no Shirin 4, Kami no Hitomi no Akuma no Heiso.

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:23.880
Yes, that is the entire name of the game.

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:25.120
Mystery Dungeon.

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:26.640
That is exactly I think what it is.

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:28.080
No, it's a learning language.

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:30.360
But Fushigi no Dungeon means Mystery Dungeon.

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:34.840
So it's not Chocobo's Mystery Dungeon, it's just the mystery is this new language you're

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:35.840
trying to learn.

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:36.840
Let me see.

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:44.560
I don't know if it's a, I don't know what language, but the guy's wearing a kind of

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:45.560
a funny hat.

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:46.560
He's got a monkey.

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:50.720
It's the funny hat game featuring monkey.

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:52.640
Also Super Robot Taisen OG Saga.

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:55.200
There's a series we can't get rid of.

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:56.200
That's right.

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:57.200
It's never going away.

01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:03.800
And on the PSP, BlazBlue Portable comes out this week as well as Katekyo Hitman Reborn,

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:07.200
Kizuna no Tag Battle, which is of course a fighting game.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.040
You can tell they're on the PSP.

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:12.440
I'm not sure if this is based off an anime, but this is like, it looks like that one where

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:16.400
you can do like four people at a time all playing at once.

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:17.400
Looks like fun.

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:20.800
That's going to do it for your Japanese release dates.

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:28.120
For the UK, we have on the 23rd Metal Slug XX and then on the 25th Blue Toad Murder Files

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:29.120
Episode 3.

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:35.440
And then the 26th, we've got Heavy Rain, Lips Party Classics, Napoleon, Total War, Sonic

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:39.080
and Sega All-Stars Racing and Undead Knights.

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:44.080
I believe Metal Slug XX is coming out over here in the US as well.

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:45.080
I love Metal Slug.

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:47.000
I must have missed that.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.640
All right, let's do just a couple more stories and then we're going to get to the classic

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:56.440
game of the week and I believe Dark Soccer has picked a true classic for you guys tonight.

01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:57.760
Better like it.

01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:01.920
You know, I picked the most piss your pants title I could think of.

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:06.880
And it ties in with a game that we had coming out this week as well.

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:09.760
We'll get there in a minute.

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:15.880
So there's some new stuff coming out, not completely unexpected from THQ that they made

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:16.880
announcements for.

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:20.920
There's going to be a sequel to The Blob, which was actually a pretty cool game that

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:23.360
came out before on the Wii.

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:29.080
And this time, though, it's going to be branded under a new sci-fi channel brand, I guess,

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:30.760
called Sci-Fi Kids.

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:31.920
I don't know why they're...

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:33.600
I didn't even know there were sci-fi kids.

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:35.840
Do they make crappy children's shows, too?

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:36.840
I didn't know.

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:39.960
Well, they did like a Wizard of Oz and an Alice in Wonderland.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.040
Yeah, where two are all really like...

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.680
They were like dark, weren't they?

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:44.680
They were weird.

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:45.680
Yeah.

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:47.800
I don't know.

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:54.440
So apparently, though, they're going to be working with the DiBlob character.

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:57.280
Maybe there'll be a cartoon show, who knows?

01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:58.400
Will a Cylon show up?

01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:01.160
I mean, maybe there's Battlestar Galactica, Caprica.

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:02.440
I don't think there's anything there.

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:05.560
When I think of Sci-Fi Network, I think of BSG.

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:06.560
I can't help it.

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:09.080
I think of crappy sci-fi movies that are normally on there.

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:10.080
That's true.

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:11.080
What is that?

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:12.080
Is that from Sci-Fi Network?

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:13.080
The Shark Meat Octopus?

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:14.080
Or what is it?

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:15.080
The Flying Shark?

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:17.080
The Flying Shark eats a plane out of the sky.

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.080
Yes.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.080
Yeah.

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:20.080
That's all those lovely sci-fi movies.

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:21.480
Yeah, they show them on the soup all the time, right?

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:22.480
Yeah.

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:23.480
Oh, good times.

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:24.480
With Deborah Gibson.

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:25.480
Yes.

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:26.880
Because, you know, she's a woman now, so no longer Debbie.

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:27.880
That's right.

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:33.160
And then the other thing, of course, DiBlob is also going to be not just on the Wii this

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:34.160
time.

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:38.600
It's also supposed to be coming to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:43.320
Also going to be some new Saints Rowan Red Faction at E3 this year.

01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:48.840
Of course, Saints Row 3 is not supposed to be coming out until 2011, which makes me very

01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:49.840
sad.

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:54.280
But the new Red Faction game is supposed to be slated for later this year, so that might

01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:55.280
be cool.

01:05:55.280 --> 01:06:01.240
And then, yeah, so I guess we'll have to wait until E3 to check those out.

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:06.200
Okay, I have to go back to the sci-fi thing for a minute, because the Blob game, yeah,

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.200
that's cool.

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:10.240
I remember playing DiBlob at PAX a couple years ago, of all places.

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:12.560
So, you know, and I remember Loki really enjoyed it too.

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:16.080
So don't get me wrong, I'm glad that game is getting a sequel, if sci-fi is putting

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:17.560
it out or however it's coming out.

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:18.560
But seriously?

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:19.560
It's still THQ, yeah.

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:23.840
Why aren't they making, like, the shark and octopus video game?

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:28.880
Like, when Alan was saying that sharks eat planes out of the sky, like, that sounds awesome.

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:31.040
Because the movie was awful.

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:36.520
But video games have plots that are about as good as a sci-fi movie, let's face it.

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:40.120
I mean, if you could, like, buy a Wii game.

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:43.880
Dark Sakura, wouldn't you want to play a video game on the Nintendo Wii?

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:49.720
Just imagine a game where it's a shark, or no, an octopus that has eight tentacles, and

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:52.040
all the tentacles are sharks.

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:54.840
And you destroy things, and Debra Gibson does a voice.

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:56.320
Wouldn't you want to buy that game?

01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:57.320
Fuck yes!

01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:58.320
See?

01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:02.240
Well, okay, they put out the Jaws game, which, granted, was awesome, because you could maybe-

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:03.240
Fuck Jaws!

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:04.240
I'm talking-

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:05.960
Did Jaws eat a plane out of the sky?

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:06.960
It could have.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:08.520
No, he chased around Richard Dreyfuss.

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:09.520
Boo hoo.

01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:10.520
Yeah, shark.

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:15.520
The guy's got one foot in the grave, come on.

01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:16.640
Did it have Debra Gibson?

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:19.960
I don't think so.

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.520
Chat room, am I crazy?

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:23.160
Well, we knew that.

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:27.040
No, I mean, for real about this, wouldn't you- Chat, would you or would you not want

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:28.040
to play that game?

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:32.960
ActDeft in chat says, President Cat versus Flying Shark Octopus.

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:33.960
There you go.

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:36.840
Dark Tetsuya says, screw President Cat, I want that game.

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:40.640
Look, I am all about these low, what the fuck, random games.

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:44.440
You ought to know that by now, listening to this show, unless it's your first time listening,

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:47.120
which again, I apologize.

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:48.120
What is that?

01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:49.120
Is that something someone linked to?

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:52.200
Uncovering the secrets of Mega Shark, death in the skies.

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:57.880
Hold on, SSJ, I hate to do this in the middle of the show, but SSJ100Matt is linking us

01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:01.800
to this YouTube, and just knowing SSJ100Matt, I think this is important.

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:02.800
Yes.

01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:04.800
Holy shit.

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:21.040
The shark is eating the plane.

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:23.200
That needs to be on the end, and the birds fly away.

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:25.160
Why is that not on the Wii?

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:28.520
Why is that not being optioned for a video game?

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:29.520
That's awesome.

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:32.960
That was 50 kinds of awesome.

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:34.240
It's so awful.

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:38.160
You're only encouraging these people.

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:43.760
Video games are kind of stupid, Loki, welcome, I mean, I realize there are some video games

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:47.560
out there with deep plots and all this stuff, but come on.

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:53.760
That just screams America, fuck yeah, shark's eating planes.

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:57.000
I just like the scene dude looks out the window, shark!

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:02.840
I assure you that watching the two seconds of that, you know, aren't necessarily as good

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:06.760
as watching the full 90 minute movie.

01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:16.960
Imagine you're sitting down with a Nintendo Wii and then all of a sudden, holy shit!

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:19.240
Why would a shark attack a plane?

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:21.200
It makes no sense.

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:25.960
Why do fighting characters decide to fight to the death and throw fireballs at each other

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:28.960
and do spinning bird kicks and all the other bullshit?

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:29.960
Come on!

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:31.480
It's a video game.

01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:32.960
Sharks can eat planes.

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:37.000
In fact, that should be in Street Fighter V.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.640
Maybe it could be in Civilization V, that's right, there is a Civilization V, how'd you

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:41.640
like that transition?

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:45.360
There is a Civilization V announced, it is coming fall of 2010.

01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:49.200
Of course, this made me squeak, you know I love my Civilization, I think Civilization

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:53.760
I is like my favorite PC game they've ever made, but good old Sid Meier and Civilization

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:59.440
series, a fifth installment coming out from 2K Games this fall, 2010.

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:03.120
And I shouldn't be surprised at this news, although I have to admit this was news I kind

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:07.640
of wasn't expecting, but then the news came out this week and I was like, fuck yeah, another

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:08.640
Civilization!

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:09.640
Cool!

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:13.160
Like, I wasn't expecting it, but cool, because the fourth one was actually really good, it

01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:14.840
was probably my favorite next to the first one.

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:17.720
But they are talking about it's going to be an all new engine, the biggest change, the

01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:22.100
most shocking change if you will, they have switched to hexagon tiles instead of square

01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:27.320
based tiles, it's now going to be hexagon, so think Catan meets Civilization, or Catanalization

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:29.320
if you will, is what I'm calling this game.

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:31.640
So there it is.

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:35.900
It's going to have of course, the leaders will be all animated, and the landscapes will

01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:40.960
be all nice, and new combats, new diplomacy, and mods, mods, mods, because they are embracing

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:43.000
of the mods community, which is very cool.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.240
Don't expect this to come out on consoles though, it's just, it's too much micromanaging

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:50.040
in Civilization game, it really can't be done on a console.

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:55.140
But of course there is Civ Revolution, which took some flack from Civ fans because it kind

01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:59.200
of dumbed down the series if you will, but I'll tell you what, I think Civ Revolution

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:00.840
is a great introduction to the series.

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:04.120
It's kind of like, I think it was an overlooked game on consoles, I think it's a lot of fun.

01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:07.760
I don't think it compares to the PC versions, but I think if you're just not much of a PC

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:14.200
gamer, or a game that is low key on your console, go for it, Civ Network is pretty cool.

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:18.680
So yeah, I'm looking forward to Civilization V.

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:19.920
Gonna get your Civ on?

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:24.320
Oh yeah, I might have to actually put down WoW to try this out for a little while.

01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:29.160
Alan, I know you play some PC games, you play like a pretty big mix of PC and console games,

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:30.160
right?

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:31.160
Yep.

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:32.480
Do you play Civilization at all?

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:33.480
Not really.

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:34.480
I don't know if this is gonna work.

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:39.840
No, but seriously though, you play a lot of shooter type games, right?

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:40.840
Yeah.

01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:42.440
What kind of PC games are you into?

01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:45.400
Lots of first person shooters, like Bioshock and Half Life.

01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:51.760
As far as a game like Civ, I was really into Rise of Nations, which was sort of a Civ clone

01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:56.360
that came out by Big Huge Games under Microsoft's Game Studios label.

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:59.040
So yeah, I played that.

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.040
Very cool.

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:08.280
All right, um, before we get to the classic game of the week, I was sent another YouTube

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:10.480
from SSJ100Matt in private.

01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:12.680
I have to watch this.

01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:24.760
This is, um, the shark goes and eats the golden gate bridge just like that.

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:26.280
During midday commute too.

01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:27.760
How rude of that shark.

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.240
Pericacra.

01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:32.840
If that was in a video game.

01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:35.360
I won't play as the fucking shark.

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:36.960
Exactly.

01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:38.920
That's why Jaws didn't sell Loki.

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:41.320
Can Jaws eat the golden gate bridge?

01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:43.320
No.

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:46.320
I think that he's tuned you out, Rob.

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:49.480
When Loki is playing some game over there, it looks like it's like on the Atari 2600.

01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:51.000
It's gotta be homebrew of some sort.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Loki, what is it?

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Speak up.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.480
What are you playing over there?

01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:55.480
It's Cream Wolf.

01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:56.480
What?

01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:57.480
Gross.

01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:01.120
What is it?

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:02.120
What is?

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:08.040
You're a werewolf ice cream guy and you have to make people fat so you can eat them.

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:09.040
Okay.

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:14.600
I'm thinking of a parody of a Shakira song already.

01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:16.160
Now I'm- Can I do my bit, Rob?

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:18.280
I guess you can do your bit.

01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:22.160
You've been very patient and suffering through an hour and a half of OLR tonight.

01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:25.200
Actually, it's only an hour and 15 minutes, but we were here in the studio for quite a

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.200
bit beforehand.

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:28.400
Classic game of the week, et cetera, et cetera.

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:32.400
Goes into the vault, finds a game, blah, blah, blah, picks one for you and it's great.

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:33.400
Yeah?

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:34.400
Yes.

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:37.560
Our game of the week is Shenmue.

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:38.560
Yay.

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:39.560
Why?

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:40.560
Yes.

01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:42.680
I would like to try a game of Lucky Hit.

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:50.080
All I found was just the soundtrack stuff because really I was getting tired of listening

01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:52.520
to Rio talk.

01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:53.880
Asking about sailors.

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:54.880
I know.

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:55.880
The sailors one.

01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:58.200
I had to go back and watch that.

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.200
Do you have sailors that come in here?

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:06.600
Well, sometimes they come in at night, but they leave before it gets too late.

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:08.240
The lady of months.

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:09.240
Yeah.

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:10.240
Anyway.

01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:17.000
Shenmue is one of the masterpieces of Yu Suzuki.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:27.480
It's really meant for interactive and to be a freeform environment and you have real life

01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:32.040
aspects like you go to bed, you get up in the morning, you pee, well, I don't know,

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:36.720
they clearly don't show him peeing, but you can also go to vending machines and arcades

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:45.280
and you can play classic games in the arcades, which is awesome, and he has a video game

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:54.000
system in his house, he has convenience stores, so it's really open as for what you can do.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:00.360
With the characters in there, basically the overall story is that Rio comes home and finds

01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:04.720
him beating up his dad and then he gets smacked around and then his dad tells him where to

01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:11.360
find something that he's looking for and the game goes from there.

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:15.160
You go around and you're actually trying to track down this guy and trying to figure out

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:20.760
what's going on and you have to talk to all the people and you have to do rescues and

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:26.760
you have to go against these other guys, it's a big investigation, you know, and you just

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:29.120
play as this guy.

01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:32.200
And you can also raise kittens.

01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:33.200
You can feed kittens.

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:34.200
Oh well, I'm sold.

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:38.200
They're cute little kittens.

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:48.760
But the game was, there were little quick-time events that were in the game too, where you

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:52.960
would witness something and you would have to hit the right button at the right time

01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:56.440
and that's how a lot of the fighting went too and then it would go along with the cut

01:15:56.440 --> 01:16:01.760
scene and you had your little questing areas and you had your different battles and Rio

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:08.360
could fight because his dad ran a dojo and of course he was going to teach his kid.

01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:14.240
The cool thing about this though is that it was supposed to be a killer app for the Saturn.

01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:16.400
That was the big thing about it.

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:28.840
In fact, you can actually find online a video of the Saturn version, it was pretty sweet

01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:35.720
for Saturn at the time, but it was going to try to revive the Saturn, you know, but since

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:40.840
the Dreamcast was coming out, they actually started working on Shenmue for, at the time

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:43.320
it was Katana, remember?

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:44.320
The working name?

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:46.720
That's right, I remember that, yeah.

01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:50.840
And then, while it was being worked on, it was called Project Berkeley, so there were

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:57.440
tech demos out under that name and then it went into actual production for Dreamcast

01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:06.320
and every character that you run into in the game has, they had voice actors for, in Japanese

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:11.880
and English, a full orchestrated soundtrack.

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:16.600
At that time, that level of voice acting was kind of unheard of too, that was pretty awesome

01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:17.600
I gotta say.

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:24.680
And then it had a weather system in the game called the Magic Weather System, so when you

01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:31.520
go through the game you have different, you know, things that are happening but they actually

01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:38.440
were meant to reflect the actual weather conditions of Yokosuka at the time, which is where he

01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:45.800
lived in Japan, and it was set in the 1986, 1987, so you could actually go and explore

01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:48.800
different parts of town too.

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:51.840
So this could have been happening concurrently with Karate Kid 2?

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:52.840
Yes.

01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:53.840
Okay.

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:59.760
I mean, you know, it's meant to be, you know, what Japan was like in the 80s in a little

01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:05.600
small town, you know, in the Japanese version you had Coca Cola stuff everywhere, which

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:12.520
is funny, since Pepsi Japan, their big thing was with, Sega's big thing was with Pepsi.

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:15.160
Do you remember they had Pepsi Man?

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:21.680
I remember in the Crazy Taxi games you were going to all the Pepsi brand restaurants.

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:26.880
But they actually put out a couple of games in Japan that were Pepsi Man.

01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:31.560
You could actually go on YouTube and look at the little commercials of Pepsi Man.

01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:35.760
So anyway, so I thought it was funny that, you know, they had Coca Cola for that one

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:42.880
everywhere and, you know, and it was, you know, also with, they were trying to show

01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:47.200
exactly what, you know, people were like in that days, like the younger generation was

01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:49.720
going more towards a western look for things.

01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:53.880
So you had your older generation in one style and your younger generation in a different

01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:55.520
style.

01:18:55.520 --> 01:19:03.800
And you also had a passport desk that you could go in and view the cut scenes for the

01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:08.040
movies, you could listen to the music, you had information so you could learn about other

01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:13.360
things going on in the game and the characters, you had the mini games you could replay, you

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:17.920
had a free battle, just all kinds of interactive stuff.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:25.080
And then you could use the passport to get to Shenmue World through the Dreamcast internet.

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:30.360
So it was, you know, just all kinds of, it had an online manual, network ranking for

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:31.680
all your things.

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:37.960
You could play with, you had VMU icons, you know, for your cute little VMU, collectible

01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:41.520
items like the toy capsules, you know, which would be like, you know, ships from other

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:46.640
games that, I had an Oppa Oppa, you know, your data review.

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:48.240
It was all kinds of stuff.

01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:53.480
And you can also track everything that you've done in the game from how long you've played

01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:59.280
to how long you've done the mini games to how many soft drinks you've bought.

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:05.240
And it, of course, discontinued when they canceled Dreamcast production.

01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:14.600
And there was a sequel, of course, which was Shenmue 2, but because it didn't sell very

01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:19.200
well, you know, Shenmue or Shenmue 2, we didn't get any more story.

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:20.200
That was it.

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:23.960
And there's people still holding their breath for Shenmue 3.

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:28.320
And I have a feeling that we might see it one day, but I like breathing.

01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:38.120
But, you know, they also did a figure that Dan showed me of Ryo driving a forklift.

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:40.960
And there's also, he's in the Sega Racers game.

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:41.960
Yes, he is.

01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:45.240
He's riding the motorbike and he also rides the forklift.

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:52.800
But you can actually buy a figure, a recent figure that came out of Ryo riding a forklift.

01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:53.800
Can I admit something?

01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:54.800
Go for it.

01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:55.800
Never played this game.

01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:57.000
Well, I'd fix that.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.280
I've heard about how fascinating it is, but I just, you know, I even had a Dreamcast,

01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:02.320
but I just never really got around to playing this game.

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:03.760
Would you like to borrow my copy?

01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:06.280
Would you like to play a game of Lucky Hit?

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:08.800
That's all I know from the game.

01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:12.000
There's some video where the dude just goes around asking everybody that.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.880
And I kind of found it funny, so.

01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:16.760
But I've always heard about its epic epicness.

01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:18.560
You can play my copy if you want.

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:20.680
I don't even know if my Dreamcast is hooked up.

01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:22.760
It's full of epic epicness, like you just said.

01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:23.760
All right.

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:25.720
Shenmue, your classic game of the week.

01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:26.720
So there it is.

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:27.720
All right.

01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:30.360
We're going to take a break here at Orange Lounge Radio, but we got plenty more to come

01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:33.560
tonight in part B. We got, of course, your phone calls and your Twitter topics.

01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:36.680
If you haven't sent in any Twitter topics, go ahead and get those in right now to at

01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:38.880
o-l-r on Twitter.

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:42.080
We're going to get to the rapid fire news as well and then get to some other stories

01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:47.740
including the kind of a surprising new iPhone game as well as some of the dates and things

01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:52.280
for the upcoming Xbox Live Block Party and some news on Fable 3.

01:21:52.280 --> 01:22:02.640
We got all that coming up right after a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:06.600
And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday night, February

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:08.440
the 21st of 2010.

01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:12.080
You are listening to that podcast where every gamer has a voice.

01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:16.920
And you might not know this, but we have an Olympic gold medal for being awesome.

01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:19.980
So we're going to talk about some more gaming news, of course, tonight.

01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:22.320
Join us if you're listening live at All Games Radio.

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:26.760
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to be as you are listening live on this Sunday.

01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:29.520
If you've never listened live before, you really should join us sometime.

01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:32.160
It's kind of a different show when you're listening live.

01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:34.700
And as Alan is finding out tonight, it's a really different show when you're sitting

01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:35.700
here in studio.

01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:36.700
Correct?

01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:37.700
Yes.

01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:38.700
Yes.

01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:39.700
What was the comparison you were making earlier during the break?

01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:40.700
I don't even know if you want to share it.

01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:41.700
But it was funny.

01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:42.700
I laughed.

01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:43.700
No, that's all right.

01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:44.700
Are you sure?

01:22:44.700 --> 01:22:45.700
Yeah.

01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:46.700
I'm good.

01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:47.700
Because I'll try to tell it.

01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:48.700
It won't be as funny.

01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:49.700
Cheers.

01:22:49.700 --> 01:22:50.700
Thanks a lot.

01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:51.700
Nice.

01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:52.700
All right.

01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:53.700
Let's go ahead and get back into some gaming news and, of course, Twitter topics coming

01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:54.700
up.

01:22:54.700 --> 01:22:55.700
So be sure to get those in.

01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:57.600
So quick stories real quick, Logie.

01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:58.600
Yes.

01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:05.400
There's a cool fan made 8-bit-esque Mega Man first person shooter game that someone's made

01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:07.860
called Mega Man 8-bit Deathmatch.

01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:12.700
And it features some of the original Mega Man characters and their kind of 8-bit glory.

01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:16.500
It's kind of almost like a Doom mod, but I don't think it is.

01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:18.360
And yeah, it's really sweet.

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:25.500
You can actually check it out on, I believe it's cutstuff.net is where you can find that

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:27.000
to download.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.220
And apparently it's free.

01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:30.380
At least they have a trailer of it and stuff.

01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:35.860
I'm not sure when it's actually being released, but it's pretty cool.

01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:37.060
Yeah.

01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:38.860
Anyways.

01:23:38.860 --> 01:23:41.740
So other things that are pretty cool.

01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:46.500
There's a lot of stuff out there that are allowing you to buy a game and get something

01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:47.500
else for free.

01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:50.540
For example, last week we talked about how if you were one of the people that bought

01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:54.860
Darksiders, you would get a code for a free Red Faction game.

01:23:54.860 --> 01:24:00.980
Well, if you didn't happen to keep your mystery code with your copy of Darksiders, fear not.

01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:07.020
You can still redeem a free copy of Red Faction Guerrilla, assuming that you have a copy of

01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:12.300
your receipt and some other stuff that they want you to send them copies of.

01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:17.660
And with that you will get a free copy of Red Faction Guerrilla and a digital art book.

01:24:17.660 --> 01:24:24.940
Also another kind of bonus THQ is handing out, with people that pre-ordered Dawn of

01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:30.620
War 2, the expansion to the Warhammer franchise, you will be able to get Saints Row 2 on PC

01:24:30.620 --> 01:24:34.100
for free, which is pretty cool.

01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:37.500
And then of course THQ isn't the only ones doing that.

01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:41.620
For Battlefield Bad Company 2 on PC, if you happen to pre-order your copy through the

01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:49.460
EA store, you will net yourself a free copy of Battlefield 2142 as well.

01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:58.420
And then finally, if you happen not to play PC games and maybe bought a PSP Go, during

01:24:58.420 --> 01:25:05.380
the last few weeks here, you'll be able to redeem, I guess, a free copy of Assassin's

01:25:05.380 --> 01:25:09.540
Creed Bloodlines or Little Big Planet for PSP.

01:25:09.540 --> 01:25:16.260
And to do this, you have to redeem it between February 18th and March 21st.

01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:20.020
Wait, so that's like if you just buy a new PSP Go, you can get one of those games for

01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:21.020
free?

01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:22.020
Yeah, during this time.

01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:23.020
Hmm.

01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:25.140
I guess they're trying to finally make it worth some of the money they're asking for

01:25:25.140 --> 01:25:26.140
it.

01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:27.140
Yeah, so that's kinda cool.

01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:28.140
Alrighty.

01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:34.860
And then finally, there was a contest that was being held for modders for Unreal Tournament

01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:41.620
3, and Epic has released the winners of the Make Something Unreal Contest, and several

01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:45.100
mod teams created a bunch of different mods for it.

01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:47.780
The winning mod was a game called The Hunted.

01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:52.220
It was a third-person survivor horror action game that kinda looked like a Wild West version

01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:53.900
of Left 4 Dead.

01:25:53.900 --> 01:25:58.900
As the winner of the contest, the team will receive $50,000 and a commercial license for

01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:03.580
the Unreal Engine, meaning the team can actually make an Unreal Engine title as a commercial

01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:05.460
product.

01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:09.380
And that'd be pretty awesome looking.

01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:11.860
So I'd watch a trailer for this and it's sweet.

01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:18.240
Some of the other winners, second place was The Ball from Toltec Studios.

01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:25.420
Third place, Angels Fall First by Plantstorm, and it's the Plantstorm team, they won $30,000.

01:26:25.420 --> 01:26:32.480
Fourth place, Prometheus, and also the Prometheus team, they won $20,000.

01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:36.260
And it looks like fifth place won $10,000, with Hazard, A Journey of Life.

01:26:36.260 --> 01:26:38.900
And they had some other categories as well.

01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:41.020
Lots of money being given away though.

01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:43.740
That's pretty cool.

01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:47.340
So yeah, hopefully we'll look forward to seeing that.

01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:52.140
Alright, well I have some quick topics for you guys here, and one of them has to do with

01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:55.940
a game that's unlikely to...

01:26:55.940 --> 01:26:59.420
It's not one you would think is as played as it is, but what does WoW have?

01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:02.580
World of Warcraft's got, what, 11, maybe 12 million players on it?

01:27:02.580 --> 01:27:03.580
I think that's about right.

01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:06.460
I think Warcraft is probably one of the biggest MMOs of that many people.

01:27:06.460 --> 01:27:09.860
What if I told you there was a game with about seven times as many players on it playing

01:27:09.860 --> 01:27:11.340
right now?

01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:12.340
It's Farmville.

01:27:12.340 --> 01:27:15.860
Yeah, that's right, there's a new story circulating game blogs this week.

01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:16.860
I hate that game.

01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:22.620
Farmville has passed 80 million users, 80 million.

01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:24.300
That's like a country, okay?

01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:25.940
That is a huge amount of people playing Farmville.

01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:30.380
Now I don't know if that necessarily means people regularly playing Farmville, because

01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:31.380
I know...

01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:33.620
Okay, look, I'll admit, I tried it out many months ago.

01:27:33.620 --> 01:27:34.620
Don't judge me.

01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:37.100
I tried it out many months ago just because I had friends that were playing, and you know

01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:40.420
you get so much spam on your Facebook, you're like, well gee, if so many of my friends are

01:27:40.420 --> 01:27:41.900
playing it, there must be something about it.

01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:46.660
Yeah, I played it for about, not even a month, maybe two weeks, and it was like, what?

01:27:46.660 --> 01:27:47.900
What am I doing?

01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:48.900
This is ridiculous.

01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:53.500
Yeah, so Farmville, of course, 80 million people playing Farmville.

01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:58.620
Look, whether you love or hate Farmville, it certainly goes to show that Facebook as

01:27:58.620 --> 01:28:00.620
a gaming platform should not be discounted.

01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:02.220
I mean, that is a huge amount of people.

01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:06.060
No word as to how many spam messages those 80 million people have sent their friends

01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:07.060
about.

01:28:07.060 --> 01:28:11.180
I don't know, sign up for this and get a million farm bucks or whatever it is, I don't know,

01:28:11.180 --> 01:28:14.900
so I can get a super cow to make lots of milk or whatever they do.

01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:15.900
Super cow.

01:28:15.900 --> 01:28:16.900
Super cow.

01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:18.700
I see all this bullshit all the time.

01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:23.260
I get all these group invites like, join me now in Farmville so I can get my honeycomb

01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:24.260
or whatever.

01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:25.260
I hid all of those.

01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:26.260
Oh my gosh.

01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:28.380
No, I get like group invites to my email.

01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:29.500
I mean, ugh.

01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:33.660
I just report him for abuse every time.

01:28:33.660 --> 01:28:34.660
I just get irritated.

01:28:34.660 --> 01:28:39.140
But see, yeah, I mean, actdeft in chat room brings up a good point, Bejeweled Blitz greater

01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:40.520
than Farmville.

01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:43.540
I will admit, I still play Bejeweled Blitz like a lot.

01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:45.180
Like Alan, you watched me play the other day.

01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:47.380
Like I was like, oh, I gotta get my score in for the week because I want to get entered

01:28:47.380 --> 01:28:49.020
in for a laptop.

01:28:49.020 --> 01:28:55.900
And uh, yeah, I have Bejeweled Blitz on my phone and well, you know, like they put Lexulus

01:28:55.900 --> 01:29:00.580
on there, which is my Scrabble game and I do Scrabble solitaire on it.

01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:02.380
That's right now the only game I still play.

01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:07.900
I mean, I still have a pet society, but I mean, seriously, all the other of those games

01:29:07.900 --> 01:29:09.540
are just completely ridiculous.

01:29:09.540 --> 01:29:11.020
Like sorority life.

01:29:11.020 --> 01:29:12.580
I rolled my eyes out.

01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:13.580
Guilty.

01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:14.580
I know.

01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:15.580
Guilty.

01:29:15.580 --> 01:29:18.940
But I'm saying that the, you know, I quit that too.

01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:25.140
I've tried some of them and I tried Farmville and I finally actually told people before

01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:30.760
they had the hide, you know, all things from this application to just stop including me

01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:32.680
on their little announcements.

01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:37.120
You know, I would hunt down people and tell them, dis-include me.

01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:40.860
Now there's a Facebook group that's like, I don't give a hoot or I don't give a shit

01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:44.540
about your mafia, your farm or your, I don't remember what it is.

01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:45.540
I joined that.

01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:46.540
Or your sorority.

01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:50.500
And then I'm kind of like, now that I'm watching all these people join this group, like it's

01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:51.500
just funny.

01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:53.580
The way Facebook works is interesting.

01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:54.580
Of course.

01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:59.260
My favorite of those groups is still, I bet this pickle can get more fans than Nickelback.

01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:04.980
Wasn't there one that's like, I bet this more, this mobius strip can get more fans than itself.

01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:07.140
I saw a group called that or what.

01:30:07.140 --> 01:30:08.140
There was another one.

01:30:08.140 --> 01:30:09.140
I don't know.

01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:11.020
There was one you joined this week or was that just a status update?

01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:16.500
Alan, you put like, I bet that X can get more fans than Y or I don't remember what it said.

01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:17.500
Something.

01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:18.500
Yes.

01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:21.660
I bet this at VAR can get more fans than pound foo.

01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:23.140
Like just variables.

01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:24.140
Programming joke.

01:30:24.140 --> 01:30:25.140
Yes.

01:30:25.140 --> 01:30:26.140
Got it.

01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:27.140
That's a very high level nerd joke.

01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:28.140
That might be too high brow for the show.

01:30:28.140 --> 01:30:29.140
Actually.

01:30:29.140 --> 01:30:30.140
I don't know.

01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:31.620
You might, you need to, you need to tone it down with some Dick and fart jokes.

01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:34.860
Oh, Hey, uh, Starcraft two.

01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:37.580
Hey, no better way to bring it to gaming than talk about Starcraft two.

01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:38.580
Of course.

01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:40.380
As you, I'm sure you've heard many other places.

01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:45.780
The beta launched this week and uh, yeah, lots of people very eager to get in this game.

01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:47.460
How eager are they?

01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:54.960
So eager that they are paying up to $300 for Starcraft two beta keys to get into this game.

01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:59.060
This is a, some of the tickets that were handed out at Blizzcon 2008 apparently.

01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:03.860
Um, now they are selling for $300 as high as four 50 they've been spotted.

01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:04.860
Wow.

01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:07.300
I mean, uh, don't get me wrong.

01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:11.500
I think Starcraft two is going to be kind of cool, but not $450 cool, dude.

01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:14.580
I can wait like a month for the finished product or not a month, three months for the finished

01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:15.580
product.

01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:19.380
That's even a lot of good news at Blizzard camp.

01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:23.860
Uh, right now though, Blizzard also this week has announced that their pandaren campaign,

01:31:23.860 --> 01:31:24.860
that's right.

01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:28.540
They were selling in game pets and world of Warcraft for 10 bucks to fundraise money for

01:31:28.540 --> 01:31:29.540
the make a wish foundation.

01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:30.540
Yeah, I bought one.

01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:31.540
Shut up.

01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:32.540
Don't judge me.

01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:34.500
Hey, I helped contribute to a cause that overall raised.

01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:41.300
They are announcing $1.1 million was raised by the pandaren monks.

01:31:41.300 --> 01:31:45.340
And uh, that was such a big donation was actually reported in the OC register, which is a pretty

01:31:45.340 --> 01:31:50.100
big, uh, um, newspaper in orange County, which you may know or not know.

01:31:50.100 --> 01:31:54.100
That's where Blizzard is headquartered, which you also may not know about orange, orange

01:31:54.100 --> 01:31:55.100
County.

01:31:55.100 --> 01:31:59.640
I believe there is an art gallery there called the orange lounge that if you Google like

01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:03.580
orange lounge, I think you put, I don't know if you put orange laundry or just like orange

01:32:03.580 --> 01:32:05.660
lounge, you get that in your results.

01:32:05.660 --> 01:32:08.420
Just kind of a lol what type of moment.

01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:13.500
Uh, anyhow, the pandaren monks are still on sale, but you should know they are no longer

01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:16.100
going towards the make a wish foundation.

01:32:16.100 --> 01:32:18.140
That was just a limited time thing.

01:32:18.140 --> 01:32:22.140
Hey, if you look up dark Sakura on Google, you get my deviant art page.

01:32:22.140 --> 01:32:23.140
Do you really?

01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:24.140
Yeah, you do.

01:32:24.140 --> 01:32:25.140
Interesting.

01:32:25.140 --> 01:32:26.580
I don't know what happens if you look up Rob Roberts.

01:32:26.580 --> 01:32:30.920
I think you just get some random old guy cause like I did a picture search and I wasn't even

01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:32.180
on page one, but that's okay.

01:32:32.180 --> 01:32:36.380
I like, I like being a little bit of an image that comes up is of some girl that says dark

01:32:36.380 --> 01:32:37.380
Sakura.

01:32:37.380 --> 01:32:38.380
Well, you're fucked.

01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:42.020
The second picture is me, um, seven years ago.

01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:43.020
Oh wow.

01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:45.300
I just think it was funny cause I like randomly doing that.

01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:46.300
So let's see what we get on.

01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:50.740
I'm going to actually do a search for orange lounge.

01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:53.820
You have some rapid fire news stories to be reading young lady.

01:32:53.820 --> 01:32:54.820
Yes I do.

01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:56.420
And by the way, I found the orange lounge.

01:32:56.420 --> 01:32:57.420
Nice.

01:32:57.420 --> 01:33:05.100
So anyway, um, yeah, with, uh, the stuff I have, we've got, um, rock band releases coming

01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:14.100
from him one night only, um, the police and Marilyn Manson.

01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:18.660
So the him pack is heart killer, Oh, to solitude wings of a butterfly, which I don't give a

01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:19.980
shit about.

01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:26.660
And then we have a KSM, um, distracted Marilyn Manson, the dope show one night only just

01:33:26.660 --> 01:33:28.940
for tonight and police walking on the moon.

01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:31.580
And they're also available for Lego rock band.

01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:38.060
Then we have, um, yeah, David Coverdale is kind of funny.

01:33:38.060 --> 01:33:45.900
Um, they, he's not sure if there's going to be any white snakes songs coming on to, uh,

01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:47.500
any of the music games.

01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:51.900
The only one that I care about is, uh, here I go again because I mean, I'm sorry, that

01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:54.580
song is just awesome.

01:33:54.580 --> 01:34:02.020
And then, um, AXIS, um, is, uh, bringing back the Kunio-kun series.

01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:10.620
We um, they are going to be, um, localizing Kunio-kun no Cho Nekketsu Dayan Dokai, which

01:34:10.620 --> 01:34:13.460
is Kunio's extreme hot-blooded athletic meet.

01:34:13.460 --> 01:34:17.620
And for those who do not know, the Kunio games are the river city games.

01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:22.280
So they are actually adopting the river city name to release these under.

01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:27.320
So we get river city super sports challenge and river city soccer hooligans, river city

01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:28.320
dodge ball.

01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:29.320
Yeah.

01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:30.320
Super dodge ball brawlers.

01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:31.320
Sweet.

01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:32.320
So that's it.

01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:35.940
All right, let's get into some Twitter topics, folks.

01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:39.540
We always invite your Twitter topics at twitter.com slash O L R.

01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:41.460
We're going to read some of your tweets.

01:34:41.460 --> 01:34:44.060
Show us your tweets.

01:34:44.060 --> 01:34:45.060
Let's see.

01:34:45.060 --> 01:34:49.260
Uh, our first tweet tonight comes to us from, um, I think that story's coming up a little

01:34:49.260 --> 01:34:50.260
later.

01:34:50.260 --> 01:34:54.580
Let me do this one for stir lock that says, do you guys use Comcast having connection

01:34:54.580 --> 01:34:55.900
issues here as well?

01:34:55.900 --> 01:34:58.260
Uh, I believe the studio is on Comcast, right?

01:34:58.260 --> 01:34:59.260
Yup.

01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:02.060
In fact, I think Comcast in the Sacramento area is really one of the only options.

01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:07.440
There's another provider called SureWest for parts of like, they suck here west Sacramento

01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:08.440
ish.

01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:10.420
I think they're really popular, but not a lot here.

01:35:10.420 --> 01:35:13.500
And um, the U-verse I don't think really exists here.

01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:14.700
Yeah, we don't have U-verse.

01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:17.860
I tried to look, I looked up all of those for my new apartment cause I want to, you

01:35:17.860 --> 01:35:20.100
know, competitively price and see who can give me the best deal.

01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:25.220
Comcast was my only option, but it looks like the internet's running fine now.

01:35:25.220 --> 01:35:26.220
So whatever.

01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:32.840
Um, let's see, uh, got a message from alpha Kananagram that's, uh, pointed us to this

01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:34.980
news story, uh, on joystick.

01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:39.340
I want to make sure this isn't coming up later in the show cause I didn't familiarize myself

01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:43.900
very well with the show world tonight, but it has to do with Nippon Ichi.

01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:48.660
The president over there is going to be resigning apparently at the March 31st.

01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:53.580
Nippon Ichi president Tomohiro Sato said that he is stepping down from his managerial post

01:35:53.580 --> 01:35:55.300
on March 31st.

01:35:55.300 --> 01:35:59.240
He's saying it is because of personal reasons, but just a coincidence.

01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:03.900
It happens to be that Nippon Ichi recently announced that they are facing a big financial

01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:04.900
decline.

01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:05.900
Uh-oh.

01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:06.900
Yeah.

01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:10.740
The personal reason is, uh, I got to get off the sinking ship quick.

01:36:10.740 --> 01:36:13.480
Hopefully things are able to turn around there.

01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:17.620
And also another tweet to us from actdeft saying, can someone buy me this please?

01:36:17.620 --> 01:36:21.580
And he links us to a story on Kotaku that talks about pre-ordering the Final Fantasy

01:36:21.580 --> 01:36:25.860
13 soundtrack, 85 tracks on four CDs.

01:36:25.860 --> 01:36:29.100
Uh, you can also get that on the North American Squeenix store.

01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:32.900
I'm sure it's going to be available through iTunes as well, but what a nice little collector's

01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:34.340
edition that would make.

01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:36.340
So there you go.

01:36:36.340 --> 01:36:37.340
Nice.

01:36:37.340 --> 01:36:39.060
I don't know.

01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:41.700
I haven't really heard a lot of the music from Final Fantasy 13 yet.

01:36:41.700 --> 01:36:45.340
Just the Leona Lewis song, but that's because that's on her CD anyway.

01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:47.200
So you can hear the little clip on iTunes.

01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:50.080
So I haven't really heard the actual music music from the game yet.

01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:55.580
So, but I did see of all places I saw on Oh No They Didn't this week, which if you've

01:36:55.580 --> 01:36:59.420
never heard of Oh No They Didn't, Alan, help me describe Oh No They Didn't.

01:36:59.420 --> 01:37:00.540
You've been a member longer than I have.

01:37:00.540 --> 01:37:01.580
How would you describe it?

01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:03.500
It's the largest community on LiveJournal.

01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:08.820
It's so, it's so large that during, um, major news events, it'll actually crash the site

01:37:08.820 --> 01:37:13.060
for one community that's totally nonprofit and they don't make any money off of it, but

01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:15.700
it's just celebrity gossip and media news.

01:37:15.700 --> 01:37:17.780
So it's just, you know, celeb lols basically.

01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:18.780
Yeah.

01:37:18.780 --> 01:37:22.180
Uh, and lots of great animated gifts are the whole reason to be on Oh No They Didn't.

01:37:22.180 --> 01:37:25.000
You find the best animated gifts you're going to find anywhere on the internet there.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:29.180
So anyway, um, Oh No They Didn't had a story about somebody posted the actual video on

01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:36.500
YouTube of Leona Lewis playing Final Fantasy 13 and it was kind of awkward to look at like,

01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:40.860
you know, she's really cute and everything, but her lines sounded really fed.

01:37:40.860 --> 01:37:44.540
Like I don't, let me see if I can find that video really quick, um, before we get to the

01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:48.580
next news story here, maybe I'll have Loki do a new story real quick while I try to find

01:37:48.580 --> 01:37:53.060
the video and then I'll come back to this cause it's, you got to hear this cause I don't

01:37:53.060 --> 01:37:54.060
know.

01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:58.700
Like as, as, as precious as Leona Lewis is, I can't really think of a good verb or adjective

01:37:58.700 --> 01:38:04.420
to describe Leona Lewis, but a precious, what seems to be one, uh, her lines sound really

01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:05.420
forced.

01:38:05.420 --> 01:38:07.320
So I've got, I got to try this.

01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:09.820
By the way, uh, Kuma JP in chat is saying quite good.

01:38:09.820 --> 01:38:11.420
Apparently the music is quite good.

01:38:11.420 --> 01:38:17.060
So chat at orange on radio.com you want me to go ahead and do this story where I try

01:38:17.060 --> 01:38:21.640
to find that YouTube, um, to kind of go back to what we talked about last week with the

01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:26.580
Xbox live arcade block party, um, got some pretty good games coming out during the month

01:38:26.580 --> 01:38:27.580
of March.

01:38:27.580 --> 01:38:32.260
Um, now we do have dates for all of them, so you can plan accordingly.

01:38:32.260 --> 01:38:37.740
And to recap, uh, March 3rd, we're going to see the release of toys soldiers for 1200

01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:41.580
Microsoft points or $15 in real money a week after that.

01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:47.260
So March 10th, we'll have a scrap metal, which is kind of a top down racing game.

01:38:47.260 --> 01:38:51.660
No one really care though, because that's the same week as I believe final fantasy 13.

01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:57.060
Um, and that's also 1200 Microsoft points or $15 on March 17th.

01:38:57.060 --> 01:39:05.700
Uh, there will be the, um, perfect dark, uh, Xbox live arcade game coming out for $10 or

01:39:05.700 --> 01:39:11.880
800 Microsoft points, and then finally, of course, as expected, uh, March 24th, the game

01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:14.740
room hub will be available, uh, for no charge.

01:39:14.740 --> 01:39:21.340
Of course, the games will run on their 400 Microsoft points or $5 for a PC and Xbox 360

01:39:21.340 --> 01:39:22.500
friendly version.

01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:28.740
Or if you want to license them for one system, 240 Microsoft points or 40 Microsoft points

01:39:28.740 --> 01:39:30.980
for a single play.

01:39:30.980 --> 01:39:32.780
I am so excited about game room though.

01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:33.780
I think it's going to be fun.

01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:37.220
And I, and I hope there'll be people that want to have competitions on the old school

01:39:37.220 --> 01:39:38.220
games with me.

01:39:38.220 --> 01:39:41.980
Cause I think I'll buy some of them, but I'm not going to buy like, I'm definitely not

01:39:41.980 --> 01:39:43.740
buying all the games that I've had.

01:39:43.740 --> 01:39:44.740
Definitely.

01:39:44.740 --> 01:39:45.740
No, I refuse.

01:39:45.740 --> 01:39:48.220
I will not buy a game that was already out on Xbox live.

01:39:48.220 --> 01:39:51.180
Although I will ask this cause I don't see a story on this anywhere else.

01:39:51.180 --> 01:39:52.420
And I read this earlier this week.

01:39:52.420 --> 01:39:55.900
Did you hear about how apparently some of the midway games have disappeared from Xbox

01:39:55.900 --> 01:40:00.940
live completely, uh, joust and smash TV, like pretty much anything that was connected to

01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:01.940
midway gauntlet.

01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:02.940
Oh, they're gone.

01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:03.940
They're gone.

01:40:03.940 --> 01:40:04.940
They're not on Xbox live.

01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:05.940
You cannot buy them now.

01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:09.420
Now they swear up and down, or at least on major Nelson's blog, it swears nothing to

01:40:09.420 --> 01:40:10.460
do with game room.

01:40:10.460 --> 01:40:11.860
It's a licensing thing.

01:40:11.860 --> 01:40:14.900
And maybe that has to do with like the Warner brothers acquisition, but I don't know.

01:40:14.900 --> 01:40:18.060
I kind of look at that and go, okay, uh huh, sure.

01:40:18.060 --> 01:40:20.160
I think it has to do with midway being gone.

01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:24.140
I think that's what it is because now, but seriously, if Joe shows up on game room, aren't

01:40:24.140 --> 01:40:28.660
you going to be like, you just get, I'm sorry, I gave a visual, but aren't you just kind

01:40:28.660 --> 01:40:32.660
of like hanging around to go really not going to be really, I don't think that's the reason

01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:33.660
why.

01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:37.420
I mean, first off, I can't imagine those games are really popular right now as far as purchases

01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:38.420
go.

01:40:38.420 --> 01:40:39.420
But they're classic.

01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:40.780
I mean, smash TV is a classic.

01:40:40.780 --> 01:40:46.800
I understand that, but you know, at the same time, I guess maybe they could be doing that,

01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:49.940
but it, I don't think it's going to matter because there's going to be Pac-Man and the

01:40:49.940 --> 01:40:54.780
Namco games aren't going away on, you know, Xbox live arcade, Konami games, I don't know.

01:40:54.780 --> 01:40:55.780
Konami games.

01:40:55.780 --> 01:40:56.780
Frogger.

01:40:56.780 --> 01:40:57.780
We'll always have Frogger.

01:40:57.780 --> 01:40:59.900
So I don't, you know, great.

01:40:59.900 --> 01:41:03.260
Um, so I don't doubt that.

01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:08.100
I don't think that's the reason why is that, you know, because they're putting them on,

01:41:08.100 --> 01:41:11.540
on that service, but well, we'll see.

01:41:11.540 --> 01:41:16.340
Uh, and I, I, I, good question from act JEFT in our chat room, Joust, then what will happen

01:41:16.340 --> 01:41:18.780
with those Xbox live 12 month game codes?

01:41:18.780 --> 01:41:22.460
I guess they're screwed or maybe you'll get the point.

01:41:22.460 --> 01:41:28.940
Well, the first off, so you know, the Xbox live 12 month game codes that are, you know,

01:41:28.940 --> 01:41:30.340
that come with free games and stuff.

01:41:30.340 --> 01:41:32.140
Um, I think they switched out those games.

01:41:32.140 --> 01:41:33.140
Yeah.

01:41:33.140 --> 01:41:34.660
They probably switched out Joust a long time ago.

01:41:34.660 --> 01:41:36.340
They do new versions all the time.

01:41:36.340 --> 01:41:40.700
And the same thing, you know, they may be off the marketplace, but those codes may still

01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:41.760
redeem it.

01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:45.000
And if you've already downloaded it and need to redownload it again, they're still up there.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.000
So they're on their servers.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Yeah.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.020
And your game doesn't stop working just because it's gone.

01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:53.340
So it, it, it may not matter that those game codes are in there.

01:41:53.340 --> 01:41:55.700
Do you know how many of those freaking games I bought?

01:41:55.700 --> 01:41:59.220
Like I think what I want to do tomorrow is just go in when I have internet again, I'm

01:41:59.220 --> 01:42:03.600
going to go in and actually just play Joust and Smash TV and all those games you can't

01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:09.100
get anymore just to fill up my gamer card to go, nah, nah, nah, I have them cause I'm

01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:10.100
weird.

01:42:10.100 --> 01:42:11.100
All right.

01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:13.460
Uh, let's go back to something I was mentioning earlier.

01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:16.860
This video is only a minute 13 so I'm going to go ahead and play it in studio.

01:42:16.860 --> 01:42:23.140
This is Leona Lewis talking about Final Fantasy 13 and this is on YouTube user Gamerspawn,

01:42:23.140 --> 01:42:27.460
although I'm guessing he probably just stole it from the, uh, official Squeenix YouTube,

01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:29.260
but this is just who I'm playing it from.

01:42:29.260 --> 01:42:30.700
So whatever.

01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:31.700
So here it is.

01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:33.700
Leona Lewis talking about Final Fantasy 13.

01:42:33.700 --> 01:42:38.780
There's a little, here we go.

01:42:38.780 --> 01:42:40.780
Pretty amazing.

01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:42.780
graphics are insane.

01:42:42.780 --> 01:42:57.140
She just did this little like, yes thing with her little hand, like a little fist.

01:42:57.140 --> 01:43:00.780
Like I don't know how many times I've been playing Final Fantasy where I went, yes, but

01:43:00.780 --> 01:43:02.180
that couldn't have looked any more forced.

01:43:02.180 --> 01:43:06.420
I just, just point out, I have to say I have though thrown down my controller and gone

01:43:06.420 --> 01:43:07.780
out for fuck's sake.

01:43:07.780 --> 01:43:08.780
Exactly.

01:43:08.780 --> 01:43:09.780
That's what I want.

01:43:09.780 --> 01:43:10.780
That's what I want to see.

01:43:10.780 --> 01:43:23.780
I want her to throw her controller at the window like fucking monster will be funny.

01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:24.780
What do you want to bet?

01:43:24.780 --> 01:43:27.620
Like she might be holding the controller, but somebody else off camera is holding the

01:43:27.620 --> 01:43:33.260
real controller and playing the game so they can show her playing the game.

01:43:33.260 --> 01:43:34.260
Cool.

01:43:34.260 --> 01:43:35.260
Cool.

01:43:35.260 --> 01:43:36.260
Amazing.

01:43:36.260 --> 01:43:41.060
I don't know until I run around the land all day.

01:43:41.060 --> 01:43:42.060
Hi everyone.

01:43:42.060 --> 01:43:45.700
I'm thrilled to be collaborating with Square Enix on such a groundbreaking game.

01:43:45.700 --> 01:43:51.060
I never would have imagined my hands as such a perfect fit for Final Fantasy 13, but the

01:43:51.060 --> 01:43:55.860
strong female protagonist struck a chord with me and I can't wait to see lightning do her

01:43:55.860 --> 01:43:56.860
thing.

01:43:56.860 --> 01:43:57.860
No one talks like that.

01:43:57.860 --> 01:44:01.260
In anticipation of the much awaited launch of Final Fantasy 13 and on behalf of Square

01:44:01.260 --> 01:44:07.740
Enix, please join us in celebration of the launch of Final Fantasy 13 on March 9th.

01:44:07.740 --> 01:44:11.780
It's like I can see her eyes reading off the cue card as she's saying.

01:44:11.780 --> 01:44:14.500
No one says protagonist.

01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:16.900
Well unless you're a literary nerd.

01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:17.900
And she's not.

01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:19.940
I could run around the land all day.

01:44:19.940 --> 01:44:20.940
This game is awesome.

01:44:20.940 --> 01:44:21.940
It has a wonderful story.

01:44:21.940 --> 01:44:24.020
I want to run around the field.

01:44:24.020 --> 01:44:26.460
It's like, come on, what is wrong with me?

01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:29.700
I see something sparkly.

01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:35.780
In defense of that, in defense of the running around all day thing, I have been doing a

01:44:35.780 --> 01:44:39.260
lot of that in Star Trek Online just to see, oh I wonder if this planet's here, oh I wonder

01:44:39.260 --> 01:44:40.260
if this planet's here.

01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:41.260
But that's an MMO.

01:44:41.260 --> 01:44:46.140
And the funny thing is, Final Fantasy 13's kind of been getting a little slack for how

01:44:46.140 --> 01:44:47.780
linear it is.

01:44:47.780 --> 01:44:52.320
Like I've heard it's kind of like, you don't have towns and the dungeons are not, you know,

01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:53.500
it's a little more linear.

01:44:53.500 --> 01:44:54.940
Although I've heard good things about the game.

01:44:54.940 --> 01:44:55.940
It's just a little different.

01:44:55.940 --> 01:44:58.860
So it's just funny to hear her say, I could just, I could just run around all day.

01:44:58.860 --> 01:45:00.260
I could just do that.

01:45:00.260 --> 01:45:02.660
I could just run around all day because that's all I know how to do.

01:45:02.660 --> 01:45:08.180
I could run around all day long and annoy the fuck out of my significant other who's

01:45:08.180 --> 01:45:11.140
watching me play this game and go, what the fuck are you doing woman?

01:45:11.140 --> 01:45:14.300
Did you want to say something Alan?

01:45:14.300 --> 01:45:18.820
I was going to say it's the only way really one of her singles is going to sell two million

01:45:18.820 --> 01:45:19.820
copies here.

01:45:19.820 --> 01:45:22.020
Is that she attaches it to that video game.

01:45:22.020 --> 01:45:24.820
Well no because then all the, all the stuck up people are going to be like, oh well the

01:45:24.820 --> 01:45:28.620
Japanese version's better because you know, everything.

01:45:28.620 --> 01:45:34.060
You know who actually had, I think to this date had the best final fantasy song ever.

01:45:34.060 --> 01:45:35.740
And that's Angela Aki.

01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:42.520
I'm sorry that hers was, was such a crap game, but kiss me goodbye was a great song and it

01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:43.520
launched her career.

01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:45.420
Was it, was that was nine, right?

01:45:45.420 --> 01:45:46.420
Yes.

01:45:46.420 --> 01:45:48.060
But I don't, I don't think nine was a crap game.

01:45:48.060 --> 01:45:49.060
It was one of the better places.

01:45:49.060 --> 01:45:51.580
It was better than eight.

01:45:51.580 --> 01:45:56.400
The thing about nine is it just kind of like, if I remember right, you know, this is many

01:45:56.400 --> 01:46:00.780
years ago, but if I remember right, nine just kind of showed up like just out of nowhere,

01:46:00.780 --> 01:46:02.300
like, Hey, Final Fantasy nine's out.

01:46:02.300 --> 01:46:03.300
Like, Oh wow.

01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:05.280
And then it was like, Hey, fanservice fanservice.

01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:07.340
And then Hey, the PS2 is out now.

01:46:07.340 --> 01:46:10.020
Like it was kind of the same thing that Final Fantasy happened with Final Fantasy 12.

01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:12.380
But it was like, Hey, here's Final Fantasy 12 finally.

01:46:12.380 --> 01:46:14.780
Oh, but the Xbox 360 and PS3 are out now.

01:46:14.780 --> 01:46:15.780
Darn.

01:46:15.780 --> 01:46:21.400
Well, I meant, and I'm not saying it was a bad game, I'm not saying crap game was more

01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:23.460
like I lost interest in it.

01:46:23.460 --> 01:46:29.800
Like I got to the, I got on the airship and I was done, you know, when you first escape,

01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:35.360
but it had the best song, uh, SSJ 100 Matt in our chat room saying, looking at the video,

01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:37.260
she is using the player one controller.

01:46:37.260 --> 01:46:38.260
Yeah.

01:46:38.260 --> 01:46:41.020
But see, if they're smart, if they're really smart, they have another system that it's

01:46:41.020 --> 01:46:47.980
sync to, and then they have the other controller sync to the other one they thought I had an

01:46:47.980 --> 01:46:50.380
idiot could play a Final Fantasy game.

01:46:50.380 --> 01:46:54.280
And after all, she did say that she liked running around the field.

01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:57.640
So maybe they just put her down and maybe that was, she was just running around the

01:46:57.640 --> 01:46:58.640
field.

01:46:58.640 --> 01:46:59.640
Okay.

01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:00.640
Look, I like Leona Lewis.

01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:01.640
She's precious.

01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:02.640
She can.

01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:05.520
Why are we picking on Leona Lewis?

01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:06.520
She's defenseless.

01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:08.560
She's like, it's like, it's like, we're kicking Bambi.

01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:10.240
Like making fun of Leona Lewis.

01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:11.240
We're not making fun of Leona Lewis.

01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:13.020
We're making fun of the song.

01:47:13.020 --> 01:47:14.020
She did an avatar.

01:47:14.020 --> 01:47:16.020
How forced that video was.

01:47:16.020 --> 01:47:18.400
I don't mind the Final Fantasy 13 song.

01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:22.880
Like I think it, I don't, I think the trailer is kind of weird with all the stuff blowing

01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:31.820
up and it's like, you know, like explosions and motorcycles, you know, it's like, it doesn't

01:47:31.820 --> 01:47:32.820
really fit.

01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:40.200
I can put that song then as my battle music in Final Fantasy 14.

01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:48.000
When you're attacking a level 75 bunny, crushing your neck,

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:53.320
Yipping your head off.

01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:55.000
I don't like doing falsetto on the show.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:01.680
Hey, let's talk about iTunes and iPhone because of course the iPhone, whether a Loki likes

01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:04.280
it or not, is another gaming platform.

01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:08.280
And apparently, um, but nevermind.

01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:09.280
Okay.

01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:14.280
Apparently there's this game out on the iPhone that folks are getting a little crazy about

01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:18.040
and it's a wobble eye boobs.

01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:26.200
This program got, use your imagination folks, $30,000 is how much this game made last year,

01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:32.040
but it was now being removed because you know, people were complaining about the sexual content.

01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:36.940
Apparently some of the rules that were given as to what is not supposed to be in your app,

01:48:36.940 --> 01:48:44.160
no images of women in bikinis, no images of men in bikinis, no skin, uh, no silhouette

01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:49.600
that indicate that wobble can be used for wobbling boobs, no sexual connotations or

01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:55.440
innuendo, boobs, babes, booty sex, nothing that can be sexually arousing and no apps

01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:58.960
will be approved that in any way imply sexual content.

01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:04.200
By the way, the guy asked us since no skin is a cited as a reason this app was pulled.

01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:11.500
He asked if a burka was okay, but the Apple guy apparently got angry at that.

01:49:11.500 --> 01:49:12.500
I don't know.

01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:15.040
Do you think, uh, Apple has a right to be removing these ads?

01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:16.040
It's gone.

01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:17.040
Huh?

01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:18.040
It's gone.

01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:19.040
Oh yeah, it's gone.

01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:20.040
Do you think Apple has a right to be taking this stuff down?

01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:21.040
Or is it free speech?

01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:24.160
I think they have a right, but I think at the same time they should offer this kind

01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:25.160
of content.

01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:28.280
I mean, just maybe locked somehow.

01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:30.680
You can download a song called boobs.

01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:34.720
And aren't there, aren't there apps about like farting and peeing and pooping and all

01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:35.720
this stuff?

01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:36.720
That's not nudity.

01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:39.000
I'm sure there's apps about blowing people up.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.000
It's not nudity.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:44.080
It's not going to go in your pants pooping does involve nudity at some point this way.

01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:45.080
Okay.

01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:51.400
You can rip people's eyes out, but God damn it, if a boob shakes, it's over for you.

01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:53.720
That's kind of messed up.

01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:55.020
Should be equal across the board.

01:49:55.020 --> 01:49:57.360
If you're going to have violent video games, which I don't know.

01:49:57.360 --> 01:49:58.360
I don't know.

01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:01.920
Apple's rules of violence, but you're going to have like, you know, the pooping calculator.

01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:06.620
I think it's my next bowel movement should be mandatory mandatory for companies that

01:50:06.620 --> 01:50:12.240
put out violent games, that there's equally as much sexual games out there.

01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:16.900
So for example, you know, in a game like God of war that has lots of bloody violence, there

01:50:16.900 --> 01:50:21.560
should be like just some really erotic game that they put out with no violence in it.

01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:22.560
It's only fair.

01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:26.480
Just make it prove that you're 18 in order to download the content.

01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:27.480
Doesn't it kind of already do that?

01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:31.340
Like I seem to remember like downloading some content and it'll say, this is a just might

01:50:31.340 --> 01:50:32.340
be objectionable.

01:50:32.340 --> 01:50:36.620
I think the keyboard cat app that I have, which will play keyboard cap at the cat at

01:50:36.620 --> 01:50:37.620
the touch of a button.

01:50:37.620 --> 01:50:38.620
It's amazing.

01:50:38.620 --> 01:50:43.120
Uh, actually says this might contain mature content and are you have to be 17 or older

01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:44.120
to continue.

01:50:44.120 --> 01:50:46.000
It's keyboard cat.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:52.000
I know, but I think that cats playing keyboard is offensive.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.400
It's cruelty to keyboards.

01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:55.400
What about dogs playing keyboards?

01:50:55.400 --> 01:50:57.440
I don't give a shit.

01:50:57.440 --> 01:50:58.440
Just curious.

01:50:58.440 --> 01:50:59.440
You should play the bassoon.

01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:00.440
I don't know.

01:51:00.440 --> 01:51:01.440
What?

01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:02.840
I think I said the bassoon for some reason.

01:51:02.840 --> 01:51:03.840
I don't know.

01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:04.840
What?

01:51:04.840 --> 01:51:05.840
Where did the bassoon come from?

01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:07.560
I think, oh, I mentioned the bassoon quartet earlier.

01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:08.560
You're in a bassoon mood.

01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:09.560
I see.

01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:10.560
I see.

01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:12.280
Rolf, the dog played keyboard before anyone.

01:51:12.280 --> 01:51:17.880
So sorry, freaking keyboard cat app.

01:51:17.880 --> 01:51:18.880
Now I have to download it.

01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:19.880
I always got to bring it back to Muppets.

01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:26.040
I mean, Rolf, the dog is used before keyboard cat.

01:51:26.040 --> 01:51:28.040
Can I do a story?

01:51:28.040 --> 01:51:29.040
Yes.

01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:33.640
Speaking of iPhone and violence, yeah, Street Fighter IV is going to be coming on iPhone,

01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:35.640
and I'm like, why?

01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:36.640
Really?

01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:37.640
Why?

01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:42.200
So far, all we see is Ken and Ryu, nothing really in action.

01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:45.200
They look kind of dinky and tiny.

01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:55.400
I wasn't aware that the iPhone had a big 3D processor in it or anything, so whatever.

01:51:55.400 --> 01:52:01.400
But in happier news for those of us who will play Super Street Fighter IV, we get some

01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:02.640
Street Fighter III characters.

01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:11.800
We get Ibuki, we get Makoto, and we get Dudley, as we mentioned, Rumor of the Week before.

01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:13.680
So that's pretty cool.

01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:16.320
And there's also this kickbox.

01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:21.200
I was looking at the Japanese, I'm sure you saw what my wallpaper was of Sakura, but it

01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:24.360
was a Super Street Fighter IV website.

01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:32.960
There's also this Korean Taekwondo fighter who's just vicious.

01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:33.960
Absolutely vicious.

01:52:33.960 --> 01:52:37.120
They show this character beating up Sagat, and they never show anyone beating up Sagat,

01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:40.240
so pretty crazy.

01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:42.640
I didn't play a lot of Street Fighter III, admittedly.

01:52:42.640 --> 01:52:45.920
Are these good characters to be bringing over, or is this kind of like, they could have picked

01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:46.920
better ones?

01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:48.720
Ibuki was my staple for Street Fighter III.

01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:49.720
Same.

01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:50.720
Yeah.

01:52:50.720 --> 01:52:51.720
She's fast.

01:52:51.720 --> 01:52:54.720
The only one who I actually would have really liked to see was Elena.

01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:56.200
I think Elena was the one I used.

01:52:56.200 --> 01:52:58.520
She's the one that kind of did like Capoeira type moves, right?

01:52:58.520 --> 01:52:59.520
Yeah.

01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:00.520
I used her when I played.

01:53:00.520 --> 01:53:01.520
She was all leg.

01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:02.520
Ah, very cool.

01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:06.240
Kind of like Eddie in Tekken 4, right, or 3, 4, 1 of the 2?

01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:07.240
3.

01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:09.520
Because after that they got Christie.

01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:11.440
So Street Fighter IV on the iPhone, huh?

01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:14.080
They're talking about porting it to the PSP also.

01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:16.080
It's going to be interesting.

01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:17.080
You know what I-

01:53:17.080 --> 01:53:19.080
I can see the PSP better than I can see the-

01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:20.640
It makes more sense because it has buttons.

01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:27.760
The screen capture, well the screen capture, this image that they had of it was like the

01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:32.040
joystick and everything was on the screen.

01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:35.520
So like, are you going to actually be able to see what you're doing?

01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:37.100
No.

01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:38.280
It's a bad idea.

01:53:38.280 --> 01:53:40.560
They're going to make money off of it, it's a bad idea.

01:53:40.560 --> 01:53:43.600
Well, you know what I think about Street Fighter IV coming to the iPhone?

01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:44.600
Your mom?

01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:54.920
Actually, no, that's the Muppet Babies theme.

01:53:54.920 --> 01:54:01.080
I just had it stuck in my head ever since Alan mentioned Rolfe, so.

01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:03.080
Let's jam to this a little bit.

01:54:03.080 --> 01:54:10.600
Because it's going to be better than Street Fighter IV on the iPhone, let's face it.

01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:20.240
Oh yeah, no, I don't care about Street Fighter IV on the iPhone, it's going to control like

01:54:20.240 --> 01:54:24.000
shit until the Apple releases an actual joystick for the iPhone.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:25.160
Who cares?

01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:27.800
But I would download a Muppet Babies app, I would.

01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:30.880
Well maybe you might be more interested in Fable III.

01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:34.680
Fable III, they're talking a little bit about the co-op in the game.

01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:39.860
And it sounds to me, even though they're claiming it's all new and stuff, it sounds just like

01:54:39.860 --> 01:54:45.940
Fable II if you ask me, but according to an interview with Peter Molyneux during the Four

01:54:45.940 --> 01:54:52.680
Guys 1UP podcast, they talked about the co-op system.

01:54:52.680 --> 01:55:00.440
Basically if you go into someone else's game, you'll take your player, your player's dog,

01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:06.640
the weapons that you've crafted as well, all the unique stuff that you've made will be

01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:07.640
in the game.

01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:11.520
So if you don't want to be tied into the person's camera, you could go off and do your own thing.

01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:16.840
But of course, just like the second game, you want to be careful of who you invite in

01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:19.760
your game because someone may come and rape all your women.

01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:20.760
Just like, you know.

01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:22.680
I hate it when that happens.

01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:23.680
Yes, exactly.

01:55:23.680 --> 01:55:29.360
Or it hits on the shopkeeper and they stop working.

01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:32.520
I hate it when I leave my house and I come back and all the women got raped while I was

01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:33.520
gone.

01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:35.720
It's just, what a downer to your day.

01:55:35.720 --> 01:55:36.720
Yes.

01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:41.800
So, does Shermie like my jacket?

01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:49.040
I think Shermie is confused at all the feet blocking access to her bed.

01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:50.040
Shermie ran away.

01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:51.040
Shermie's like, fuck this.

01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:52.040
No, she didn't run.

01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:53.040
She waddled.

01:55:53.040 --> 01:55:54.040
I won't go get pie.

01:55:54.040 --> 01:55:57.800
She waddled with her little shaking belly.

01:55:57.800 --> 01:56:05.160
So just looking at this, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say Fable 2 and Fable 3,

01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:08.000
probably not that much different from each other.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:09.000
What a shock.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:16.440
Despite all this hype, you know, much like the hype from Fable 1 to Fable 2, don't be

01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:18.000
surprised if they're very similar.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:21.840
Well, if I get to bring all this stuff into the game, can I bring Shermie into my game?

01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:22.840
That's what I want to do.

01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:24.880
What would she do?

01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:25.880
Poop?

01:56:25.880 --> 01:56:27.080
Not be able to run and catch up.

01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:31.560
No, she'd find a towel that was laying around in your game and piss on it, which is what

01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:34.120
she's been doing lately.

01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:36.080
Fuck you to my cat.

01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:37.920
We're not at that segment yet.

01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:41.400
Anyhow, we'll get there, though.

01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:42.400
We'll be there in a minute.

01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:47.820
But first, I want to mention this story about a Darksiders demo that's coming to Xbox Live

01:56:47.820 --> 01:56:50.040
and PlayStation Network on February 25th.

01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:51.780
Apparently, it's a pretty extensive demo.

01:56:51.780 --> 01:56:56.460
They're saying, THQ and Vigil Games, they're saying this demo is going to be 90 minutes

01:56:56.460 --> 01:57:02.120
to complete for the average player, which means I'll be able to beat it in 30.

01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:03.120
No, 120.

01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:05.200
Yeah, 90 minutes for the average player.

01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:09.920
Apparently, it's the entire first dungeon of the game and two bosses from the game.

01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:15.920
So that's coming out on February 25th for the game Darksiders.

01:57:15.920 --> 01:57:20.480
I guess they just wanted to see, wanted to really give you a whole in-depth look at the

01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:21.480
game.

01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:22.840
It seems like, why not?

01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:27.840
You know, if a game is going to take 50 hours to complete, what's with giving away an hour

01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:28.840
and a half for free?

01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:32.840
They could have given away an hour and a half demo for Oblivion and people would just come

01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:33.840
to you.

01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:34.840
I mean, there's games.

01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:35.840
Get people hooked.

01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:38.640
Games like Saints Row where, you know, they had a half an hour demo, I played that demo

01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:39.640
like 80 times.

01:57:39.640 --> 01:57:40.640
It was awesome.

01:57:40.640 --> 01:57:41.640
Yeah.

01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:42.640
Get people hooked.

01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:43.640
And then there you go.

01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:44.640
Kill time until the game came out.

01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:45.640
All right.

01:57:45.640 --> 01:57:48.540
Uh, we're going to get into the mailbag section of our show.

01:57:48.540 --> 01:57:52.880
Every time you guys send us emails at mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, we take a moment

01:57:52.880 --> 01:57:57.920
during the show to rip open the mailbag and pick a few of our favorite emails to read.

01:57:57.920 --> 01:58:02.080
Dark Soccer is going to dive into the mailbag at mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and read

01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:03.560
some emails right now.

01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:05.480
Hi guys, it's Sam S again.

01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:09.200
I just wanted to say sorry about criticizing your haste when it comes to the feed.

01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:13.400
The article about PopCap dumbass struck as potentially mind blowing.

01:58:13.400 --> 01:58:15.800
I think I'm on the same rage level as Loki on this one.

01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:16.800
The guy is a dumbass.

01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:21.560
There is no reason PopCap reps need to say anything about the general gaming populace.

01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:24.360
They have no fucking clue what the average gamer wants.

01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:29.040
This guy needs to shut his mouth and also the iPad is a disgrace and I wish it would

01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:31.200
be the downfall of Apple Go Microsoft.

01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:33.640
Um, whatever.

01:58:33.640 --> 01:58:36.080
Now this is- Can I respond to that real quick?

01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:40.920
Like dude, you're welcome to your opinion and all that fun stuff, but like, okay, even

01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:48.480
if the iPad fails, Apple still has ginormous business as a phone company.

01:58:48.480 --> 01:58:50.080
I know that's not what they started as.

01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:54.360
They started with those little green monitors that were in all of our grade school classrooms,

01:58:54.360 --> 01:58:58.400
but they're a huge phone company now and yet computers and all that stuff too, but like

01:58:58.400 --> 01:59:03.040
the phone thing is huge- The Mac is still the standard of the graphic

01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:04.040
design industry.

01:59:04.040 --> 01:59:08.640
But yeah, I do remember Loki going off on that one show that was kind of funny and yeah,

01:59:08.640 --> 01:59:09.640
he had a point.

01:59:09.640 --> 01:59:12.280
I'll, I'll, I'll meet you halfway there.

01:59:12.280 --> 01:59:14.880
Now for the long ass email of the night.

01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:15.880
Yay!

01:59:15.880 --> 01:59:16.880
Hi, O.L.R.

01:59:16.880 --> 01:59:21.660
I'm not sure how much help this email will be, but I was listening to your last two podcasts

01:59:21.660 --> 01:59:26.160
and wanted to know what it would take to get the video game development companies to be

01:59:26.160 --> 01:59:27.160
unionized.

01:59:27.160 --> 01:59:30.640
I'm definitely no expert, but I work for a local in Chicago.

01:59:30.640 --> 01:59:34.440
Although I have no say in the local's decisions or anything, I've been with them for a while

01:59:34.440 --> 01:59:36.200
now and I've seen how things are done.

01:59:36.200 --> 01:59:38.600
I also work closely with one of the largest unions in the US.

01:59:38.600 --> 01:59:42.760
I'm not an employee, but I visit them every day and I see some of the big wigs on a daily

01:59:42.760 --> 01:59:43.760
basis.

01:59:43.760 --> 01:59:47.120
I'm no expert, but some of what they do has rubbed off on me.

01:59:47.120 --> 01:59:50.320
At first I thought it involved simple factors like the size of a company or what percentage

01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:52.520
of said company wants to be unionized.

01:59:52.520 --> 01:59:58.000
I talked to some of the folks at work and they summarized what they said.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:02.320
Those employees that want to organize need to sit down with the organizer and well, get

02:00:02.320 --> 02:00:03.320
organized.

02:00:03.320 --> 02:00:09.440
AFSCME, AFL-CIO, and SCIU are one of the biggest unions, SCIU dealing with USA, Canada, and

02:00:09.440 --> 02:00:10.680
Puerto Rico.

02:00:10.680 --> 02:00:14.000
One of the ladies at work said that the video game industry would probably fall under the

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:18.440
entertainment category, which should mean that all of the unions, the AFL-CIO is the

02:00:18.440 --> 02:00:19.440
one to contact.

02:00:19.440 --> 02:00:22.680
What they need to do is contact their closest AFL-CIO branch.

02:00:22.680 --> 02:00:27.180
It all depends, although, because I don't know which video game company you had in mind.

02:00:27.180 --> 02:00:30.600
If you were thinking EA, where a friend of mine works, they would need to contact the

02:00:30.600 --> 02:00:32.280
Sacramento office or maybe San Francisco.

02:00:32.280 --> 02:00:33.280
I honestly can't remember.

02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:35.520
I didn't take notes and there's a link.

02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:42.520
It's actually aflcio.org slash join a union slash how slash how to dot CFM.

02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:46.880
Now you can end my email here, but I'd like to voice my opinion on this.

02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:50.320
Protecting video game workers is probably supported by most gamers who feel they should

02:00:50.320 --> 02:00:53.320
have fair work hours, pay, and everything else.

02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:59.560
However, say there's a strike at Square Enix and it prevented the release of the newest

02:00:59.560 --> 02:01:02.900
Final Fantasy game or strike at Capcom that's keeping the newest crossover fighting game

02:01:02.900 --> 02:01:04.240
from coming out.

02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:06.840
Will gamers still support the striking workers?

02:01:06.840 --> 02:01:08.760
Who will gamers choose the product to the workers?

02:01:08.760 --> 02:01:12.600
I honestly don't know what I'd want more to be honest.

02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:16.000
Remember the writer strike that prevented new episodes of TV shows from premiering?

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:19.920
Were you reading for the writers or were you craving more episodes of lost or ugly Betty?

02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:20.920
Oh wow.

02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:22.120
My, my insertment.

02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:24.240
I didn't care.

02:01:24.240 --> 02:01:25.600
I don't, I don't really watch.

02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:29.200
I know you don't watch a lot of TV, but look from the standpoint of somebody who was like,

02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:32.320
I think the writer's strike kind of ruined heroes that show.

02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:36.420
Well, the second season was already kind of poopy, but like, I don't know, like the writer's

02:01:36.420 --> 02:01:39.560
strike really damned some shows that were on a roll.

02:01:39.560 --> 02:01:42.720
I see, I see the point the email was trying to make.

02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:45.880
It's a, it's a, it's a great point and one I didn't, one I didn't consider last

02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:46.880
week.

02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:48.320
That's why I'm glad we got emails on it.

02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:51.840
But if companies also want to keep their product going, they need to have a quality work environment

02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:53.760
for the people that are working for them.

02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:58.480
You have to respect the worker, but to continue, I remember in high school after I graduated,

02:01:58.480 --> 02:02:02.400
the teachers were striking for whatever reason, maybe pay, and they kept school from starting

02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:05.720
on time, which meant the end of the school year was that much later.

02:02:05.720 --> 02:02:09.400
The students were not happy and wanting, and one of the striking to end, not for the teacher

02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:11.200
sake, but for their early release.

02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:16.000
Who knows, I probably didn't want to be on the teacher side because teachers aren't

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.360
usually students' best friend, who knows.

02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:21.480
So yeah, I wouldn't know, um, know what I'd go for.

02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:25.960
If you support the workers, then be really sure you still support them, even at the cost

02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:28.600
of the release date of a game you're really looking forward to.

02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:31.920
Stan, Rob, it was nice to meet, it was nice meeting you when you came to ASIN.

02:02:31.920 --> 02:02:32.920
I know I was kind of boring.

02:02:32.920 --> 02:02:33.920
Oh, okay, okay.

02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:34.920
I know who this is.

02:02:34.920 --> 02:02:39.240
Well, that was a great email and, and, and brought up some points and, um, I don't,

02:02:39.240 --> 02:02:43.480
I don't know if you told me you worked for a union, but that's really neat that, um,

02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:46.280
to kind of see that side of it and kind of brought up some things I didn't think about.

02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:49.020
Like especially, yeah, what would happen if they go on strike?

02:02:49.020 --> 02:02:52.640
You know, we hear all these reports about conditions and again, I want to make this

02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:53.640
clear.

02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:57.480
I wasn't necessarily like supporting saying they should unionize, I was just kind of asking

02:02:57.480 --> 02:03:01.040
the question, what about like, is it a feasible option?

02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:02.040
Question mark.

02:03:02.040 --> 02:03:03.040
I don't know.

02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:09.160
You know, the only, the only way anything's going to change if, is, is if something is

02:03:09.160 --> 02:03:10.160
done.

02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:14.720
So I was just suggesting maybe union, is that something maybe then it's kind of neat to

02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:18.880
get that email and think about that perspective is that, you know, if, if that were to happen,

02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:23.080
uh, strikes would be a very real possibility and people already bitch and complain when

02:03:23.080 --> 02:03:27.440
games are delayed, even if the game is being delayed for quality reasons.

02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:28.440
You know?

02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:29.440
Yeah.

02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:30.880
A lot of people have been, I think Final Fantasy was a good example.

02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:35.240
A lot of people have been given Final Fantasy some smack because 13 has taken forever to

02:03:35.240 --> 02:03:36.240
come out.

02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:39.880
But what if it had been delayed even more because of some type of, of workers strike?

02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:41.680
That's a, an interesting point.

02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:42.680
I don't know.

02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:47.120
I would like to think me personally, I'm okay with the game being delayed as long as they're

02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:48.840
going to put out a quality product at the end.

02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:51.320
Like I was really looking forward to blur that was supposed to come out fourth quarter

02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:55.160
last year, but they delayed it to this year because they want to make sure online wasn't

02:03:55.160 --> 02:03:56.160
fucked.

02:03:56.160 --> 02:03:57.160
And I'm okay with that.

02:03:57.160 --> 02:03:58.640
I would rather they fix it than put out a crap game.

02:03:58.640 --> 02:03:59.640
Oh, I agree.

02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:01.640
I agree with that.

02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:06.680
Um, there actually is one more email, um, about, uh, the unions.

02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:12.280
Hey, O-O-L-R. I know we've been on this topic for three weeks now, so I will keep it short.

02:04:12.280 --> 02:04:16.600
The problem with unionizing game developers is that unions cost extra money that game

02:04:16.600 --> 02:04:19.120
publishers are just not going to be willing to pay for.

02:04:19.120 --> 02:04:21.680
They'll just hire non-unionized employees.

02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:25.480
Lord knows that there are enough people desperate to get into the industry by any means possible

02:04:25.480 --> 02:04:29.520
that they will work god awful hours thinking they're the next best game developer since

02:04:29.520 --> 02:04:30.520
Miyamoto.

02:04:30.520 --> 02:04:34.640
Basically, as long as there are people to take advantage of, this will probably never

02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:35.640
stop.

02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:38.720
Unfortunately, it doesn't leave much room for people with families who don't want to

02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:41.760
or simply can't work 12 hour days, seven days a week.

02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:45.040
These people get suckered in by company lies when they say they're getting hired for the

02:04:45.040 --> 02:04:49.980
job saying that crunch periods will only happen on a necessity basis.

02:04:49.980 --> 02:04:54.540
The crunch period slowly becomes perpetual and if they don't crunch, they get fired.

02:04:54.540 --> 02:04:58.360
The only light at the end of the tunnel I can see is if all the talent gets wise to

02:04:58.360 --> 02:05:01.720
this sort of thing and the bottom is just going to fall out of the industry.

02:05:01.720 --> 02:05:05.760
There are no senior level developers left and all you have is a bunch of hotshots with

02:05:05.760 --> 02:05:09.160
a degree who don't actually know how to get a game out on time.

02:05:09.160 --> 02:05:13.160
The EA's, Rockstar's, Activision's of the world need to realize that their employees

02:05:13.160 --> 02:05:17.000
are really the ones who make the money for them and if they don't treat them well, they

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.040
won't have a leg left to stand on.

02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:20.480
Hopefully I kept that brief enough.

02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:23.980
As a programmer myself, I count my blessings for being employed by a company that lets

02:05:23.980 --> 02:05:29.720
us go home at 7 p.m. though plenty of us stay later willingly and doesn't make us work weekends

02:05:29.720 --> 02:05:33.120
and I think it's outrageous that there are situations like this right in my backyard

02:05:33.120 --> 02:05:35.120
since I work in Silicon Valley.

02:05:35.120 --> 02:05:37.880
Here's truly AZHP.

02:05:37.880 --> 02:05:41.980
Well I wish we could name, I completely understand why you don't want to say who you work for

02:05:41.980 --> 02:05:48.860
on a delicate subject like this so please, but I wish we could recognize whatever company

02:05:48.860 --> 02:05:55.280
that is and go yay and pat them on the back for having kind of a good employee policy

02:05:55.280 --> 02:05:58.060
like that.

02:05:58.060 --> 02:06:02.280
Maybe that's what it's going to take is negative press for these companies like EA and whatever

02:06:02.280 --> 02:06:06.120
else we've heard about with the nightmare hours to curb it.

02:06:06.120 --> 02:06:08.200
Bad press is never really a good thing.

02:06:08.200 --> 02:06:09.200
I don't know.

02:06:09.200 --> 02:06:10.200
It's not an easy issue.

02:06:10.200 --> 02:06:15.840
I think this second emailer makes a really good point about the whole people are dying

02:06:15.840 --> 02:06:17.320
to get into the video games industry.

02:06:17.320 --> 02:06:22.840
I mean most of those tester positions are like temps, they're temp jobs through contracting

02:06:22.840 --> 02:06:26.880
agencies and that's how many people get their foot in the door which is why I think it's

02:06:26.880 --> 02:06:31.520
hilarious that they're glamorizing the whole thing on this PlayStation 3 show, the tester

02:06:31.520 --> 02:06:33.460
or whatever it's called that's coming out.

02:06:33.460 --> 02:06:35.760
Now granted I haven't watched it yet.

02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:38.280
You get to test Barbie soccer.

02:06:38.280 --> 02:06:42.840
I'll look at it because I like reality TV and I like video games so you would think

02:06:42.840 --> 02:06:46.680
I would like some and I like how sparks so you would think I'm all about something like

02:06:46.680 --> 02:06:49.920
the tester but I just I know I'm not gonna like it.

02:06:49.920 --> 02:06:52.840
I just know it.

02:06:52.840 --> 02:06:56.520
But something like that kind of glamorizes what might not actually be that glamorous.

02:06:56.520 --> 02:07:00.240
It's just a little hard watching a show that's basically a commercial shoved down your throat.

02:07:00.240 --> 02:07:01.480
Did you watch it?

02:07:01.480 --> 02:07:04.320
No, but I can guess what it's gonna be.

02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:06.160
A giant commercial shoved down my throat.

02:07:06.160 --> 02:07:07.160
Oh look it!

02:07:07.160 --> 02:07:09.000
Let's test God of War 3!

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:13.920
Oh my goodness it's so epic and wonderful but look at all these bugs!

02:07:13.920 --> 02:07:14.920
No it's not gonna be like that.

02:07:14.920 --> 02:07:19.880
All it's gonna be is them stupid challenges that are game related and then they get to

02:07:19.880 --> 02:07:24.460
talk about how awesome it was to get to play God of War 3 for anybody else.

02:07:24.460 --> 02:07:29.640
You know what would make me watch the tester is if RuPaul was the judge.

02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:35.480
You know and that at the end of every episode remember don't fuck it up.

02:07:35.480 --> 02:07:40.560
It's time for you to lip sync for your life.

02:07:40.560 --> 02:07:44.160
Seriously if you've never watched Drag Race it's like the best reality show on right now.

02:07:44.160 --> 02:07:45.640
Well can I read the last email?

02:07:45.640 --> 02:07:46.640
Of course.

02:07:46.640 --> 02:07:49.520
Dear OLR, I have a pair of questions for Loki.

02:07:49.520 --> 02:07:55.640
If I buy a banned modded 360 console and play a game with a patch, can I download the patch

02:07:55.640 --> 02:07:58.840
and will the patch prevent me from playing a burned game?

02:07:58.840 --> 02:08:01.360
I wholly understand if you refuse to answer this question.

02:08:01.360 --> 02:08:03.760
Stay care entertainment.

02:08:03.760 --> 02:08:06.400
Repeat that.

02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:08.560
A banned modded 360.

02:08:08.560 --> 02:08:10.560
Okay.

02:08:10.560 --> 02:08:13.060
And has a game that patches released for it.

02:08:13.060 --> 02:08:18.400
Can you download the patch and will the patch prevent you from playing the burned game?

02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:20.840
No the patch will not prevent you from playing the burned game but you're not going to be

02:08:20.840 --> 02:08:23.360
able to connect to live to download the patch.

02:08:23.360 --> 02:08:28.080
So you would have to download the patch by some other means and then transfer it to your

02:08:28.080 --> 02:08:33.840
hard drive and then yes you would be able to do that.

02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:35.960
It's over!

02:08:35.960 --> 02:08:39.640
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us emails.

02:08:39.640 --> 02:08:42.040
I think that's the way Dark Soccer should end the mailbag every week.

02:08:42.040 --> 02:08:43.040
It's over!

02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:47.360
There is actually a website though that does carry all of the game patches that are out

02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:52.200
there for Xbox 360 and you can download them all individually and search by title.

02:08:52.200 --> 02:08:56.200
Unfortunately I do not remember what that website is but I know that if you do a search

02:08:56.200 --> 02:09:00.120
on Google you'll probably be able to find it because I've seen it a few times.

02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:05.600
But that would be the way to do it if you're going to bother patching a game.

02:09:05.600 --> 02:09:09.920
Alright well now that the email segment is done it's time for us to get to the angst

02:09:09.920 --> 02:09:14.640
but Dark Soccer ran out real quick so I guess let's just cover some gaming news.

02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:17.000
We'll do the angst before Skypline tonight.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.560
Okie dokie.

02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:23.360
So let's see let's talk about a few naughty games.

02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:25.180
Yay!

02:09:25.180 --> 02:09:26.180
Naughty games!

02:09:26.180 --> 02:09:27.400
Bubble Bath Babes 2?

02:09:27.400 --> 02:09:28.400
Not quite.

02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:30.280
This is actually Miss World Nude 2010.

02:09:30.280 --> 02:09:32.960
This doesn't even really have a game involved with it.

02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:37.560
I mean they're just, it's basically if Ubisoft were to release this today it would be probably

02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:40.440
called My Masturbation Coach.

02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:42.140
Press A C Tits?

02:09:42.140 --> 02:09:43.640
Is that the name of the game?

02:09:43.640 --> 02:09:51.000
No it's basically a game that tracks your masturbation and what not.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:55.600
Wait is this like, instead of like My Fitness Coach or Wii Fit?

02:09:55.600 --> 02:09:56.600
Exactly.

02:09:56.600 --> 02:09:58.440
It tracks your...

02:09:58.440 --> 02:09:59.440
Masturbation.

02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:00.440
Ok.

02:10:00.440 --> 02:10:01.440
Alright.

02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:09.080
Do you have to enter it in manually?

02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:10.080
Funny.

02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:15.880
Anyways the game is from the game developer Waffle which they went right there because

02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:17.520
their name is Waffle.

02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:19.280
I can't compete with that.

02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:25.480
The Eero title looks, let me butcher this real quick here.

02:10:25.480 --> 02:10:32.800
Looks like a Migeti Ga Tomarane Boku 2.

02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:33.800
I'm not even going to bother.

02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:37.080
Are we talking like a Belgian Waffle or like an Eggo?

02:10:37.080 --> 02:10:38.080
It's just Waffle.

02:10:38.080 --> 02:10:40.080
Waffle, Waffle, Waffle.

02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:41.080
Anyways.

02:10:41.080 --> 02:10:46.440
That's going to be in a song someday I know that.

02:10:46.440 --> 02:10:49.040
That's the code name of the game right there.

02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:50.040
Waffle, Waffle.

02:10:50.040 --> 02:10:55.160
Anyways so the game records important events or everyday events.

02:10:55.160 --> 02:10:58.720
For example, today's play style, Socks Masturbation.

02:10:58.720 --> 02:11:05.280
Yes, they give you inspirational methods of masturbation.

02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:11.120
For example, number of times you've wanked today, total number of times wanked so far,

02:11:11.120 --> 02:11:17.480
there is a graphical chart that has it all, time taken for ejaculation and average time

02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:18.480
taken for ejaculation.

02:11:18.480 --> 02:11:21.240
Is it animation with little dead sperm?

02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:23.680
They've got like cute anime girls that are in there.

02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:24.680
But it gets better.

02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:25.680
It gets better.

02:11:25.680 --> 02:11:31.160
And then of course they have a wonderful database where you can organize and track information.

02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:37.040
Total time spent wanking so far, total number of ejaculations so far.

02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:41.360
And then of course, oh this is even better.

02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:49.600
And then they list innovative methods of masturbation you might have never thought about.

02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:54.640
Including in the diagram here, it looks like that stuff cut out of foam and then someone

02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:57.280
has like foam pieces in the tube.

02:11:57.280 --> 02:11:58.280
I don't know.

02:11:58.280 --> 02:12:04.560
Anyways, but then of course the game is sold with like a pocket pussy as well.

02:12:04.560 --> 02:12:05.560
Oh!

02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:09.400
I thought you just used the Wii Fitness board.

02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:11.720
The Tenga Egg Wavy is what it's called.

02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:15.320
I thought that's what the resistance strap was for.

02:12:15.320 --> 02:12:16.320
Ripped for your pleasure.

02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:24.240
I mean yeah, the cover, I mean it's just topless anime chicks all wet and thriving around.

02:12:24.240 --> 02:12:28.440
There is no way you would not know what this game is about.

02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:32.080
So yes, that is coming from Waffle in Japan.

02:12:32.080 --> 02:12:33.080
Waffle!

02:12:33.080 --> 02:12:34.080
Waffle!

02:12:34.080 --> 02:12:39.240
I'm sorry, but it's just, I don't know if you've ever played my personal walking coach

02:12:39.240 --> 02:12:43.320
on the DS, but you can actually connect to the internet and upload your steps to this

02:12:43.320 --> 02:12:47.920
big online database that shows you how far the world has walked to the moon or the earth.

02:12:47.920 --> 02:12:53.880
So you should be able to do the same thing here and show total lost productivity time.

02:12:53.880 --> 02:13:02.080
I would imagine that the pedometer could probably be used in a slimmer fashion for this device.

02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:06.600
Not gonna see this on DSiWare unfortunately.

02:13:06.600 --> 02:13:08.800
Okay and then the other thing, there's a weird glitch that's actually...

02:13:08.800 --> 02:13:10.160
But wait, there's more!

02:13:10.160 --> 02:13:12.520
Yes, there is more.

02:13:12.520 --> 02:13:14.480
No More Heroes 2, Desperate Struggle.

02:13:14.480 --> 02:13:21.780
Of course there's a lot of sexual innuendo in the game, but there is also a save glitch

02:13:21.780 --> 02:13:27.040
apparently that causes one of the female characters to appear completely naked.

02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:28.920
I'm watching it.

02:13:28.920 --> 02:13:35.600
And it's funny, it's basically because Travis in the game, the way he saves is by taking

02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:39.960
a dump in like a toilet, and that's the animation that they show.

02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:47.320
Well this chick that's in the game, she's actually taking a shower.

02:13:47.320 --> 02:13:49.840
Well the glitch is that somehow she ends up in the middle of the...

02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:50.840
Ew!

02:13:50.840 --> 02:13:53.760
No, she does not take a dump in the shower.

02:13:53.760 --> 02:13:58.360
A Shinobu.

02:13:58.360 --> 02:14:00.160
I'll give you a moment.

02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:01.160
She's not...

02:14:01.160 --> 02:14:02.160
Well she's fake naked.

02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:06.600
Yeah, it's Sims naked type of stuff.

02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:10.680
But still, the thing is that she does not have clothes on and they cannot patch that

02:14:10.680 --> 02:14:11.680
out.

02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:15.560
Go Nintendo.

02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:19.120
No word on how exactly to recreate the glitch, but it is on YouTube for those who want to

02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:21.280
check it out.

02:14:21.280 --> 02:14:23.600
Rob is having a real life segfault right now.

02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:25.000
It's pretty amazing.

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:32.040
I can't get the image in my head of the game saving her pooping in the shower.

02:14:32.040 --> 02:14:34.800
Like that's nasty.

02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:36.480
That doesn't just watch down the drain.

02:14:36.480 --> 02:14:40.680
He even calls it dropping a save.

02:14:40.680 --> 02:14:43.080
I'm gonna go drop a save.

02:14:43.080 --> 02:14:53.720
And SSJ100Matt threw out the requisite tub girl question mark in our chat.

02:14:53.720 --> 02:14:57.520
No, it's not tub girl.

02:14:57.520 --> 02:14:58.520
Meh.

02:14:58.520 --> 02:14:59.520
Alright.

02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:01.520
Ow, my stomach hurts.

02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:02.520
Please.

02:15:02.520 --> 02:15:22.320
Yeah, we need to do the FUs of the week now because I hurt from laughing.

02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:28.160
FU to a bunch of little tiny minor things adding up to put me in the single worst mood

02:15:28.160 --> 02:15:30.520
I have ever been in in ages.

02:15:30.520 --> 02:15:31.520
Rob, breathe.

02:15:31.520 --> 02:15:32.520
I'm trying.

02:15:32.520 --> 02:15:34.520
I don't know why it's so funny.

02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:35.520
Okay, I'm okay.

02:15:35.520 --> 02:15:36.520
I'm okay.

02:15:36.520 --> 02:15:37.520
Carry on.

02:15:37.520 --> 02:15:39.520
You're still speaking like you've been kicked in the nuts.

02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:40.520
Carry on.

02:15:40.520 --> 02:15:41.520
We're fine.

02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:42.520
Try to do a show.

02:15:42.520 --> 02:15:43.520
Professional radio.

02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:44.520
Uh huh.

02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:45.520
Yeah, right.

02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:46.520
We're professional.

02:15:46.520 --> 02:15:51.800
And a secondary FU to my wrist because I've started crocheting again.

02:15:51.800 --> 02:15:56.560
This problem with my wrist swelling on one of the tendons has actually come back.

02:15:56.560 --> 02:16:00.640
I started using a thumb trackball mouse to get it to go away.

02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:04.360
But no, I discovered that I like crocheting again and so now it's decided to come back

02:16:04.360 --> 02:16:07.120
so I have to stop crocheting as often.

02:16:07.120 --> 02:16:08.120
See?

02:16:08.120 --> 02:16:09.120
Aww.

02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:11.120
Ew, you can kind of see that.

02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:13.960
Yeah, I'm going to take a picture of it and put it up online because I'm that kind of

02:16:13.960 --> 02:16:14.960
exhibitionist.

02:16:14.960 --> 02:16:15.960
Wanna see?

02:16:15.960 --> 02:16:22.600
Who wants to see my big bump?

02:16:22.600 --> 02:16:25.240
Careful waffle entertainment might put that in their next game.

02:16:25.240 --> 02:16:26.240
Loki.

02:16:26.240 --> 02:16:29.600
Uh, empty my cold.

02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:31.400
I hate coughing.

02:16:31.400 --> 02:16:33.240
It's tough.

02:16:33.240 --> 02:16:34.720
Um, I don't know.

02:16:34.720 --> 02:16:35.720
I'm not super angsty.

02:16:35.720 --> 02:16:40.000
FU to that not funny image that made me not stop laughing.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:47.080
Um, FU to just, um, moves taking me like three weeks to accomplish moving.

02:16:47.080 --> 02:16:50.900
Although everything was really smooth with the big furniture today, I still have so much

02:16:50.900 --> 02:16:51.900
stuff to clean.

02:16:51.900 --> 02:16:52.900
So FU to cleaning.

02:16:52.900 --> 02:16:53.900
Grrr.

02:16:53.900 --> 02:16:54.900
Argh.

02:16:54.900 --> 02:16:58.920
Um, Alan, do you have any FUs of the week you'd like to share with our audience?

02:16:58.920 --> 02:17:06.120
FU to having to, uh, job search or super serious rather than just casually having to find another

02:17:06.120 --> 02:17:07.120
job.

02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:10.600
Do you want to try sharing some of your talents in case anyone's looking to hire somebody?

02:17:10.600 --> 02:17:13.640
You can always get a job as a video game tester.

02:17:13.640 --> 02:17:14.640
Oh yeah.

02:17:14.640 --> 02:17:15.640
Yes, he's breathing.

02:17:15.640 --> 02:17:19.640
I think he qualifies.

02:17:19.640 --> 02:17:20.640
So all right.

02:17:20.640 --> 02:17:24.600
Uh, let's go ahead and, uh, let me do another story for you guys here from, uh, one more

02:17:24.600 --> 02:17:28.880
story and then we're going to open up the Skype line at one eight seven seven game O

02:17:28.880 --> 02:17:33.320
L R username on Skype is orange lounge radio, but we do have one more story and it's about

02:17:33.320 --> 02:17:38.640
a new video game movie in the works and that movie missile command.

02:17:38.640 --> 02:17:40.160
Yes, that's right.

02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:43.920
Missile command apparently is being made into a movie at least.

02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:44.920
Well, I don't know.

02:17:44.920 --> 02:17:48.160
A lot of things they say are going to get made into a movie, but don't really, but this

02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:49.220
is the latest one.

02:17:49.220 --> 02:17:53.720
It's got more of a plot than monopoly, the movie and clue and all this stuff, right?

02:17:53.720 --> 02:17:54.840
They were talking about previously.

02:17:54.840 --> 02:17:56.160
They should not remake clue.

02:17:56.160 --> 02:17:57.160
Clue was awesome.

02:17:57.160 --> 02:17:58.160
The first time.

02:17:58.160 --> 02:18:01.640
Well, apparently, uh, it's coming from the Los Angeles times that Atari is trying to

02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:06.600
sell a missile command film to do whatever they want to try to make to a movie production

02:18:06.600 --> 02:18:09.320
company, uh, to get the missile command movie made.

02:18:09.320 --> 02:18:11.840
I don't know what it would be about, uh, but whatever.

02:18:11.840 --> 02:18:17.960
It's gotta be better than like Armageddon was no word if yards revenge might become

02:18:17.960 --> 02:18:18.960
a movie.

02:18:18.960 --> 02:18:19.960
Who knows?

02:18:19.960 --> 02:18:20.960
I don't know.

02:18:20.960 --> 02:18:21.960
What kind of movie would you make at a missile command?

02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:27.120
I don't know where either if I'm just going to be in the movie or not.

02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:28.120
What's that?

02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:29.120
A crappy one.

02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:30.600
I don't know.

02:18:30.600 --> 02:18:31.600
I don't know.

02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:32.600
Whatever.

02:18:32.600 --> 02:18:33.600
Yeah, of course.

02:18:33.600 --> 02:18:34.600
It's not showing up.

02:18:34.600 --> 02:18:35.600
That came up in chat.

02:18:35.600 --> 02:18:41.360
Like two people asked is Mr Awesome, the star going back to some, uh, years old topics from

02:18:41.360 --> 02:18:44.280
all games, radio, the network that we are on.

02:18:44.280 --> 02:18:48.000
Let's get to the Skype line and quickly one eight seven seven game O L R. If you'd like

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:51.600
to give us a call right now, Skype line is open for business or you can give us a call

02:18:51.600 --> 02:18:55.240
at username orange lounge radio on Skype.

02:18:55.240 --> 02:18:58.120
We'll get to your calls in just a moment while we wait for those calls to come in cause there's

02:18:58.120 --> 02:18:59.120
always a little bit of a delay.

02:18:59.120 --> 02:19:01.040
We'll get to some last minute stories.

02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:02.040
Loki.

02:19:02.040 --> 02:19:03.040
Yes.

02:19:03.040 --> 02:19:06.900
Uh, the new expansion for resident evil five also featured in the gold edition, um, has

02:19:06.900 --> 02:19:11.480
an Easter egg where you can actually unlock the classic camera and you already talked

02:19:11.480 --> 02:19:12.480
about that, didn't you?

02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:15.960
No, that was one of my stories that you put in there.

02:19:15.960 --> 02:19:16.960
Thank you.

02:19:16.960 --> 02:19:17.960
Sorry.

02:19:17.960 --> 02:19:21.640
You won't, you wanted to talk about that, but sorry.

02:19:21.640 --> 02:19:22.640
Well how about something else?

02:19:22.640 --> 02:19:26.440
I've got one on the ESRB site.

02:19:26.440 --> 02:19:28.360
Q's working on a pixel junk racer.

02:19:28.360 --> 02:19:29.360
Second lap.

02:19:29.360 --> 02:19:33.480
There you go.

02:19:33.480 --> 02:19:37.120
It appears that racers is the one that plays like a super sprint or whatever that old ass

02:19:37.120 --> 02:19:38.120
Atari game is.

02:19:38.120 --> 02:19:39.120
Right?

02:19:39.120 --> 02:19:40.120
Yeah.

02:19:40.120 --> 02:19:41.120
Okay.

02:19:41.120 --> 02:19:42.120
I remember that one.

02:19:42.120 --> 02:19:43.120
Yes.

02:19:43.120 --> 02:19:44.120
Let's go to the phones.

02:19:44.120 --> 02:19:45.120
We got a call.

02:19:45.120 --> 02:19:46.120
Hi, you're on orange lodge radio.

02:19:46.120 --> 02:19:47.120
Who's this?

02:19:47.120 --> 02:19:48.120
This is the legend of Zaku.

02:19:48.120 --> 02:19:49.120
What's on your mind?

02:19:49.120 --> 02:19:50.120
Uh, nothing much.

02:19:50.120 --> 02:19:53.120
Just recovering from another dull and lackluster weekend.

02:19:53.120 --> 02:19:58.120
Um, yeah, I just, I think, I don't know if you've probably heard about this story that

02:19:58.120 --> 02:20:02.640
was like hitting up the rounds on slash side and I think could, could talk to recently

02:20:02.640 --> 02:20:08.100
about a company, but a video game developer who had, who had operations in Australia and

02:20:08.100 --> 02:20:13.600
apparently since, uh, for some reason or another, we're trying to pull out of that country.

02:20:13.600 --> 02:20:19.080
But before they did, they actually snuck into their, you know, to the Australian offices,

02:20:19.080 --> 02:20:24.720
you know, their developers that they had down there, they snuck in and they actually, they

02:20:24.720 --> 02:20:29.080
actually took the, the code, she took the, the IP from them.

02:20:29.080 --> 02:20:31.680
Well, you know what I think about that?

02:20:31.680 --> 02:20:32.680
What?

02:20:32.680 --> 02:20:40.040
Uh, yeah, uh, no, I, I, well, I don't know.

02:20:40.040 --> 02:20:42.920
What do you think is this, is this justice that they have a right to go in and steal

02:20:42.920 --> 02:20:44.400
the code that they made or no?

02:20:44.400 --> 02:20:46.920
Well, I mean, the whole situation is in a gray area.

02:20:46.920 --> 02:20:52.320
I mean, you have on one hand, according to that, according to that company, which is

02:20:52.320 --> 02:21:00.480
a inner zone, they said that because they use a third party HR firm, they basically,

02:21:00.480 --> 02:21:03.840
they basically, you know, they're shifting the blame on them because they screwed up

02:21:03.840 --> 02:21:11.720
all the, all the paperwork, legal paperwork with the Australian tax offices and especially,

02:21:11.720 --> 02:21:14.880
you know, they're also blaming that country for not giving them the incentives that they

02:21:14.880 --> 02:21:20.880
were, that they were owed for actually, for actually setting up operations there.

02:21:20.880 --> 02:21:24.200
And then you see the developers, you know, with their other side of the story where they

02:21:24.200 --> 02:21:29.680
were, you know, overworked and to the point where they didn't even get paid at all.

02:21:29.680 --> 02:21:35.840
They were literally working without a paycheck, which I mean, this is the, this is one of

02:21:35.840 --> 02:21:40.960
those, you know, unfortunate tales of the video game industry where you have a developer

02:21:40.960 --> 02:21:49.240
that tries to like, you know, cut, cut corners, even though he's trying to make a, trying

02:21:49.240 --> 02:21:52.760
to make, in other words, he's trying to make it, he's trying to make a quick dollar by

02:21:52.760 --> 02:21:57.840
trying to outsource things that normally most companies would be able to take care of on

02:21:57.840 --> 02:21:58.840
their own.

02:21:58.840 --> 02:22:01.280
Zaco, do you wear a hard hat when you call on the show?

02:22:01.280 --> 02:22:02.280
Not really.

02:22:02.280 --> 02:22:03.280
Oh, I was just curious.

02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:07.800
Um, well, you know, if they're working for this company though, and the company is paying

02:22:07.800 --> 02:22:11.280
them to do a job and the job is to write code for this game.

02:22:11.280 --> 02:22:12.280
Okay.

02:22:12.280 --> 02:22:13.280
Okay.

02:22:13.280 --> 02:22:14.280
Are you ready?

02:22:14.280 --> 02:22:18.520
The reason why Rob was making banging noises is because that's what it sounds like when

02:22:18.520 --> 02:22:19.520
you type.

02:22:19.520 --> 02:22:24.920
Well, it's not my fault that the, the microphone is so close to the webcam on my Mac book.

02:22:24.920 --> 02:22:25.920
All right.

02:22:25.920 --> 02:22:30.360
I'm just saying that's why Rob was making the noises and asking about the hard hat.

02:22:30.360 --> 02:22:31.920
I can't type fluently.

02:22:31.920 --> 02:22:32.920
I'm more pecker.

02:22:32.920 --> 02:22:37.240
Anyways, as we were saying, wait, did you just say you're a pecker?

02:22:37.240 --> 02:22:45.000
I just, you know, you know, we, we give our favorite people the hardest time look in all

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:49.880
services to answer the question or to respond to the, I guess the story about it is that,

02:22:49.880 --> 02:22:55.100
you know, there's a certain kind of like yay hero to the story about them going in and

02:22:55.100 --> 02:22:58.040
stealing this code because the developers are screwing them over.

02:22:58.040 --> 02:23:02.320
But the bottom line is, you know, they, they are signing the checks and paying them to

02:23:02.320 --> 02:23:04.280
write code for this game.

02:23:04.280 --> 02:23:06.240
And if you know, it doesn't work out.

02:23:06.240 --> 02:23:11.320
It's still owned by the people who sign those paychecks, but when you actually go for months

02:23:11.320 --> 02:23:15.940
without paying your employee and just try to shift blame, you know, not make any, any

02:23:15.940 --> 02:23:25.020
valiant effort to rectify the situation that, I mean, the owners falls on that company labor.

02:23:25.020 --> 02:23:26.960
Is this an American company?

02:23:26.960 --> 02:23:32.200
It's basically an American company, which you know, has supposedly has a studio in Australia.

02:23:32.200 --> 02:23:34.700
They'll get, they'll get the pants suit off of them anyway.

02:23:34.700 --> 02:23:40.560
I mean, right now the Australian tax board, you know, as I said, they, they're, they're

02:23:40.560 --> 02:23:46.540
owed lots of, you know, back taxes because, you know, as I said, if they outsource human

02:23:46.540 --> 02:23:52.520
resources and payroll to an Australian company that didn't do their job, it's the parent

02:23:52.520 --> 02:23:57.800
company's responsibility to make sure that those taxes are paid and everything is settled

02:23:57.800 --> 02:23:59.360
in whatever country they're operating.

02:23:59.360 --> 02:24:03.760
I mean, this is, this applies for any other company that sets a shop anywhere else.

02:24:03.760 --> 02:24:09.080
They have to play by the local, you know, they had to play by the local, yeah, the play

02:24:09.080 --> 02:24:10.800
by the municipality's rules.

02:24:10.800 --> 02:24:17.320
Like if I were to set up something, you know, if I were to set up a company in another country,

02:24:17.320 --> 02:24:19.020
I'll be under their jurisdiction.

02:24:19.020 --> 02:24:23.960
So I'd have to make sure that my company was running legitimately over there.

02:24:23.960 --> 02:24:28.000
It'll be interesting to see all the lawsuits that go back and forth on this whole thing.

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:32.520
But Zach, Zach, we gotta, we gotta wrap up and get to some other calls, but, um, thank

02:24:32.520 --> 02:24:33.840
you very much for the call.

02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:34.840
All right.

02:24:34.840 --> 02:24:35.840
All right.

02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:36.840
Later, dude.

02:24:36.840 --> 02:24:37.840
All right.

02:24:37.840 --> 02:24:38.840
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:24:38.840 --> 02:24:39.840
Who's this?

02:24:39.840 --> 02:24:42.240
Um, hi, this is Elite Slayer.

02:24:42.240 --> 02:24:44.840
Hey, Elite Slayer, what's on your mind?

02:24:44.840 --> 02:24:50.600
Um, well, I was actually, um, on, I was on my laptop earlier and we were starting to

02:24:50.600 --> 02:24:57.420
talk about the, um, Halo Reach beta and we, and then they were like, oh, and they wanted

02:24:57.420 --> 02:25:00.280
to know more about, you know, like the Halo storyline.

02:25:00.280 --> 02:25:03.020
And I know a lot about like bungee in the storyline.

02:25:03.020 --> 02:25:08.880
And so we started talking about it and then, um, this guy came on and then we got into

02:25:08.880 --> 02:25:14.920
this full blown argument about whether there were Spartans left in the Halo saga when like

02:25:14.920 --> 02:25:17.700
Halo three was happening or not.

02:25:17.700 --> 02:25:24.000
And I was on the side of that there was because, you know, just thinking master chief was,

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:31.120
um, he, and, uh, the whole storyline was kind of following him, but you never actually realized,

02:25:31.120 --> 02:25:34.760
you know, kind of the other Spartans out there may have been left.

02:25:34.760 --> 02:25:40.840
So, um, but the other guy was talking about this and I don't know where these facts are

02:25:40.840 --> 02:25:45.920
coming up, but he said that, um, in Halo two and in Halo three, they're talking about how

02:25:45.920 --> 02:25:50.560
he was the last Spartan and there was, um, no one else left.

02:25:50.560 --> 02:25:53.440
And he was the only guy that could help this war.

02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:56.840
And to be honest with you, I did not play Halo two.

02:25:56.840 --> 02:26:01.880
Um, I mean, I've watched all the cut scenes and everything, but I didn't watch Halo.

02:26:01.880 --> 02:26:04.600
I watched, I didn't play Halo two.

02:26:04.600 --> 02:26:09.320
Um, even though, you know, I know it's, um, what's happening, you know, from the graphics

02:26:09.320 --> 02:26:13.000
to the world's worst cliffhanger on there.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:18.140
But um, I just seriously don't know, this is driving me crazy about whether there's

02:26:18.140 --> 02:26:24.920
Spartans left, um, whether there was actually Spartans left in Halo three or there wasn't,

02:26:24.920 --> 02:26:31.240
I mean, um, is there like a place in the storyline that actually says there is or isn't because

02:26:31.240 --> 02:26:35.560
how they're talking about how in Halo reach that's new coming up, you know, you can play

02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:40.640
the beta on May 3rd now, um, when it comes up, but how they're talking about how he had

02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:43.560
a squad and then they're thinking they all died.

02:26:43.560 --> 02:26:44.680
You know, I just don't know.

02:26:44.680 --> 02:26:47.240
It's driving me crazy to be honest with you.

02:26:47.240 --> 02:26:50.000
Out of curiosity, do you have your own show?

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:51.840
Cause you just talked for two minutes.

02:26:51.840 --> 02:26:54.760
There was, is fascinating.

02:26:54.760 --> 02:26:55.760
I mean, yeah.

02:26:55.760 --> 02:27:00.920
Uh, you know, you can say I'm kind of the person that can, I can actually talk a lot,

02:27:00.920 --> 02:27:03.840
but what I like to do for fun, like this may surprise you.

02:27:03.840 --> 02:27:05.920
Um, I like to debate a lot.

02:27:05.920 --> 02:27:10.800
I mean, I'm not kidding you.

02:27:10.800 --> 02:27:15.140
People will, um, be like, they, after it's done, they're like, do you hate me now?

02:27:15.140 --> 02:27:16.400
I'm like, no dude.

02:27:16.400 --> 02:27:17.400
I just did that.

02:27:17.400 --> 02:27:18.400
Cause I was pretty much bored.

02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:25.320
I mean, that's it, you know, that's how, that's my personality to be honest with you.

02:27:25.320 --> 02:27:30.720
But I don't, uh, lead Slayer, I'm going to answer your question quite, quite simply.

02:27:30.720 --> 02:27:31.720
I don't know.

02:27:31.720 --> 02:27:39.360
I, did you know, no, I wasn't paying attention to everything, but, uh, did you, um, happen

02:27:39.360 --> 02:27:44.000
to catch the new Halo legends, uh, anime series that they had?

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.360
Cause there's a lot of, uh, different backstory stuff.

02:27:46.360 --> 02:27:51.680
I think in there too, it might, um, yeah, I'll tell you this though.

02:27:51.680 --> 02:27:58.200
Um, I saw, I saw the first four episodes of Halo legends and I looked at it and I'm like,

02:27:58.200 --> 02:28:02.800
Oh my God, you know, I'm like, where, cause a lot of the stuff there, it does go along

02:28:02.800 --> 02:28:06.960
the series, but then it's like some of the stuff, you know, it's like they're pulling,

02:28:06.960 --> 02:28:11.080
just pulling out of their ass, you know, I'm like, where did this come from?

02:28:11.080 --> 02:28:16.440
Because in, um, the third episode, they're riding these motorbike things, um, in like

02:28:16.440 --> 02:28:21.120
space and, um, just doesn't make any sense.

02:28:21.120 --> 02:28:26.480
Um, but, um, I'm starting to say I'm a lot, oh my God.

02:28:26.480 --> 02:28:27.480
That's all right.

02:28:27.480 --> 02:28:28.480
That's all right.

02:28:28.480 --> 02:28:29.480
You're nervous.

02:28:29.480 --> 02:28:30.480
It's a radio show.

02:28:30.480 --> 02:28:31.480
Okay.

02:28:31.480 --> 02:28:32.480
Wait before we got to wrap up here and go soon and I gotta be honest.

02:28:32.480 --> 02:28:35.440
I don't know the answer to your Halo question, but maybe it's answered one of these books

02:28:35.440 --> 02:28:36.440
or whatever.

02:28:36.440 --> 02:28:37.440
Oh yeah.

02:28:37.440 --> 02:28:39.800
There's books too on the whole Halo thing, but I want to, I want to debate you real quick

02:28:39.800 --> 02:28:40.800
on a certain topic.

02:28:40.800 --> 02:28:41.800
Okay.

02:28:41.800 --> 02:28:46.240
Uh, since you're a big debate person, let's debate, uh, what, what is cooler keyboard

02:28:46.240 --> 02:28:49.040
playing cats or keyboard playing dogs?

02:28:49.040 --> 02:28:50.040
Okay.

02:28:50.040 --> 02:28:52.040
And you start and take whatever side you want.

02:28:52.040 --> 02:28:57.400
All right, dude, I got to go with, um, I, yeah, I heard your second on this earlier.

02:28:57.400 --> 02:29:02.640
I got to say cats because just think cats, you've got low cap cats are crazy.

02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:06.560
You got these animated gifts, you got all these things, you know, um, it's gotta be

02:29:06.560 --> 02:29:07.720
one of a cool app.

02:29:07.720 --> 02:29:12.120
Um, you know, everyone loves kittens, they're cute, they've got all this funny crap with

02:29:12.120 --> 02:29:13.120
them.

02:29:13.120 --> 02:29:14.120
They're swearing.

02:29:14.120 --> 02:29:17.200
Kittens have, you know, they're just awesome.

02:29:17.200 --> 02:29:18.200
Okay.

02:29:18.200 --> 02:29:20.680
Well you're wrong and you're an idiot.

02:29:20.680 --> 02:29:21.680
Okay.

02:29:21.680 --> 02:29:22.680
Okay.

02:29:22.680 --> 02:29:23.680
You're a liar.

02:29:23.680 --> 02:29:24.680
Okay.

02:29:24.680 --> 02:29:25.680
I got this.

02:29:25.680 --> 02:29:26.680
Kittens are awesome.

02:29:26.680 --> 02:29:34.440
I mean, I know I can sometimes be a dog person, but on, you know, online and iPhone, you know,

02:29:34.440 --> 02:29:35.440
kittens are so much better.

02:29:35.440 --> 02:29:38.360
They're funner, they lighten up your day.

02:29:38.360 --> 02:29:40.400
I mean, they make you smile.

02:29:40.400 --> 02:29:41.400
Come on.

02:29:41.400 --> 02:29:43.400
It comes down to this.

02:29:43.400 --> 02:29:44.400
Okay.

02:29:44.400 --> 02:29:49.160
The easiest way you can determine which one's cooler, which is obviously cats, is because,

02:29:49.160 --> 02:29:51.320
okay, dogs are trainable.

02:29:51.320 --> 02:29:52.320
Cats are the untrainable.

02:29:52.320 --> 02:29:53.320
Okay.

02:29:53.320 --> 02:29:57.080
To train a cat to play a keyboard, well, force a cat to play keyboard.

02:29:57.080 --> 02:29:58.080
Same thing.

02:29:58.080 --> 02:30:01.200
Why are we even talking about this?

02:30:01.200 --> 02:30:02.200
Why?

02:30:02.200 --> 02:30:03.200
It's so much cooler.

02:30:03.200 --> 02:30:09.680
At least Slayer, this has been a heck of a call, but I've got to let you go so we can

02:30:09.680 --> 02:30:11.760
get some more, but thank you for your call to the show.

02:30:11.760 --> 02:30:12.760
Yeah.

02:30:12.760 --> 02:30:13.760
Take care.

02:30:13.760 --> 02:30:14.760
Later, man.

02:30:14.760 --> 02:30:16.400
You know what was awesome about that phone call?

02:30:16.400 --> 02:30:19.820
Not a damn thing came of it.

02:30:19.820 --> 02:30:24.120
We never even bothered to answer his question, but then he took two minutes to ask.

02:30:24.120 --> 02:30:25.120
Dude, Wikipedia.

02:30:25.120 --> 02:30:26.120
I don't.

02:30:26.120 --> 02:30:27.120
Yeah.

02:30:27.120 --> 02:30:28.120
Halo Wiki.

02:30:28.120 --> 02:30:29.120
All right.

02:30:29.120 --> 02:30:34.000
The whole chat room is going gong, gong, please end this, make it stop.

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.720
Why are you doing this to me?

02:30:36.720 --> 02:30:41.480
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:30:41.480 --> 02:30:42.480
Who's this?

02:30:42.480 --> 02:30:46.960
This is somebody that's not going to fap into a keyboard or sit there and get a stupid conversation

02:30:46.960 --> 02:30:48.560
about stupid stuff like Halo.

02:30:48.560 --> 02:30:49.560
Are you sure?

02:30:49.560 --> 02:30:51.040
Oh, I'm definitely sure.

02:30:51.040 --> 02:30:52.240
Dude, really?

02:30:52.240 --> 02:30:53.240
What's on your mind?

02:30:53.240 --> 02:30:54.240
Who is this?

02:30:54.240 --> 02:30:55.240
What's up, guys?

02:30:55.240 --> 02:30:56.240
This is excellent.

02:30:56.240 --> 02:30:57.240
This is excellent.

02:30:57.240 --> 02:30:59.320
Hey, X-Link, what's on your mind?

02:30:59.320 --> 02:31:01.320
Nothing much, man.

02:31:01.320 --> 02:31:05.880
Just getting ready to shoot myself in the head with DS, calling every... Oh, I'm not

02:31:05.880 --> 02:31:06.880
going to get to it, seriously.

02:31:06.880 --> 02:31:07.880
Hey, X-Link.

02:31:07.880 --> 02:31:08.920
Just thinking about this.

02:31:08.920 --> 02:31:11.120
It's the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:31:11.120 --> 02:31:12.120
No, it's going to be soon.

02:31:12.120 --> 02:31:13.120
It's going to be called.

02:31:13.120 --> 02:31:16.080
The next time you go in a while, I'm going to put a hit on you with every single Horde

02:31:16.080 --> 02:31:20.440
member going after you for surprise money for putting DS Master on the line.

02:31:20.440 --> 02:31:25.000
It's going to be like an episode of the Guild, which, by the way, tangent, I watched the

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:30.120
entirety of season one and two of the Guild last night with Alan, because everything was

02:31:30.120 --> 02:31:33.360
packed except for the computer, because if you're a nerd, the computer's the last thing

02:31:33.360 --> 02:31:34.360
you pack.

02:31:34.360 --> 02:31:38.480
So all I had was instant Netflix, because the PS3 was packed, all the DVDs were packed.

02:31:38.480 --> 02:31:39.480
So we decided to watch instant Netflix.

02:31:39.480 --> 02:31:43.360
I don't know if you know, but the Guild is now available seasons one and two on Netflix,

02:31:43.360 --> 02:31:46.280
and you just kind of reminded me of one of the episodes where one of the guildies is

02:31:46.280 --> 02:31:51.540
kind of leading a secret double life to make one of the other Guild members that she's

02:31:51.540 --> 02:31:53.920
mad at make his life hell.

02:31:53.920 --> 02:31:54.920
I don't know.

02:31:54.920 --> 02:31:55.920
What did you think of the Guild?

02:31:55.920 --> 02:31:56.920
Oh, I loved it.

02:31:56.920 --> 02:31:57.920
I loved that show.

02:31:57.920 --> 02:31:58.920
Oh, you've seen it, X-Link?

02:31:58.920 --> 02:31:59.920
I'm sorry?

02:31:59.920 --> 02:32:00.920
You've seen it, X-Link?

02:32:00.920 --> 02:32:01.920
Oh, yes.

02:32:01.920 --> 02:32:02.920
Yes, definitely.

02:32:02.920 --> 02:32:03.920
Yeah.

02:32:03.920 --> 02:32:04.920
I've seen both seasons.

02:32:04.920 --> 02:32:05.920
Yes.

02:32:05.920 --> 02:32:06.920
It's a little bit over the top for me.

02:32:06.920 --> 02:32:12.560
Like, some of it's just, like, a little too out there, but, you know, for nerd lols, it's

02:32:12.560 --> 02:32:13.560
pretty good.

02:32:13.560 --> 02:32:14.560
What did you think, Alan?

02:32:14.560 --> 02:32:15.560
You watched it too with me.

02:32:15.560 --> 02:32:16.560
Did you like it, or was it a little like-

02:32:16.560 --> 02:32:17.560
Yeah, it was good.

02:32:17.560 --> 02:32:20.480
I've been on WoW for about two or three months, so I get all the jokes now.

02:32:20.480 --> 02:32:21.480
Oh, there you go.

02:32:21.480 --> 02:32:24.000
All right, what did you really call in to talk about tonight?

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:31.880
No, I was calling about Ubisoft and what bastardization they're doing with the whole DRM and stuff.

02:32:31.880 --> 02:32:35.920
You know, like I said before, and besides the Imagination series and stuff like that,

02:32:35.920 --> 02:32:38.800
don't forget they also did, like, the CSI series.

02:32:38.800 --> 02:32:44.760
They were also part of, you know, the Press Your Luck, which, oh, yeah, thanks Ubisoft.

02:32:44.760 --> 02:32:47.360
Now I can't now play any of those cool game show games.

02:32:47.360 --> 02:32:49.360
You just hit a whammy.

02:32:49.360 --> 02:32:50.360
Congrats.

02:32:50.360 --> 02:32:51.360
Yeah.

02:32:51.360 --> 02:32:53.080
So now you're going to stop me from playing Addis as well.

02:32:53.080 --> 02:32:56.640
And my mom, because my mom likes a series of games, so you're going to make her stop

02:32:56.640 --> 02:32:59.740
because she doesn't have an internet connection in her place, so.

02:32:59.740 --> 02:33:04.200
Bravo on that, I know there's going to be a patch and there's going to be ways of getting

02:33:04.200 --> 02:33:07.680
around it, so I'm not the least bit worried, but still, I mean, it's just the fact that

02:33:07.680 --> 02:33:10.320
it's going to be a headache just before all that, you know?

02:33:10.320 --> 02:33:12.160
And like you said before, it's going to be a headache.

02:33:12.160 --> 02:33:15.940
You're going to have all these people who doesn't know all these different ways around

02:33:15.940 --> 02:33:16.940
it.

02:33:16.940 --> 02:33:19.400
They're going to sit here and they're going to— yeah, they're going to flood the support

02:33:19.400 --> 02:33:21.040
lines because of all this, you know.

02:33:21.040 --> 02:33:24.920
And you can't take a PC game back to the store, so best of luck on that.

02:33:24.920 --> 02:33:25.920
Nope.

02:33:25.920 --> 02:33:26.920
So, I...

02:33:26.920 --> 02:33:27.920
I do...

02:33:27.920 --> 02:33:30.040
Do you think, though, that it's gonna work?

02:33:30.040 --> 02:33:32.680
I mean, don't you think it's just gonna get cracked within a couple days?

02:33:32.680 --> 02:33:33.680
I mean...

02:33:33.680 --> 02:33:37.240
Yeah, it will get cracked, but you gotta realize, too, a lot of people don't know this difference

02:33:37.240 --> 02:33:38.240
of what we do.

02:33:38.240 --> 02:33:41.460
And a lot of the people, I'm gonna feel bad for because they're gonna buy the game.

02:33:41.460 --> 02:33:42.460
They're gonna open it up.

02:33:42.460 --> 02:33:43.460
They're gonna put it in.

02:33:43.460 --> 02:33:44.460
They're not realizing this is gonna happen.

02:33:44.460 --> 02:33:47.920
And once they realize it's gonna happen, they're gonna try to take it back to the store and

02:33:47.920 --> 02:33:48.920
they're gonna be like...

02:33:48.920 --> 02:33:50.560
The store's gonna be like, sorry, that's tough.

02:33:50.560 --> 02:33:51.880
You should have known that beforehand.

02:33:51.880 --> 02:33:54.640
I think you and I are on the same page there.

02:33:54.640 --> 02:33:56.720
You don't wanna debate me like the last caller did.

02:33:56.720 --> 02:33:57.720
That's...

02:33:57.720 --> 02:33:58.720
Nah.

02:33:58.720 --> 02:33:59.720
Yeah.

02:33:59.720 --> 02:34:00.720
Boring.

02:34:00.720 --> 02:34:01.720
I know.

02:34:01.720 --> 02:34:02.720
All right.

02:34:02.720 --> 02:34:03.720
Well, what else is...

02:34:03.720 --> 02:34:04.720
Sorry.

02:34:04.720 --> 02:34:05.720
Anything else on your mind tonight, X-Link, before I let you go?

02:34:05.720 --> 02:34:06.720
No, that was pretty much about it.

02:34:06.720 --> 02:34:09.040
I just thought it was kind of interesting when I was hearing about all that, you know.

02:34:09.040 --> 02:34:12.120
You know, there's more games than just the Imagination series and...

02:34:12.120 --> 02:34:15.420
You know, with all these things we're seeing, you know, with... between the Ubisoft news

02:34:15.420 --> 02:34:18.420
and then we're talking about the whole... what was it?

02:34:18.420 --> 02:34:22.760
SOCOM or whatever that game is on PSP that's gonna have the multiplayer's gonna charge

02:34:22.760 --> 02:34:25.140
if you didn't buy it new.

02:34:25.140 --> 02:34:27.080
You're gonna see all these inventive things.

02:34:27.080 --> 02:34:29.600
It's just... it's not even the beginning of the end.

02:34:29.600 --> 02:34:30.600
Not even.

02:34:30.600 --> 02:34:34.800
And the interesting thing about that would be that also is I would love to see the responses

02:34:34.800 --> 02:34:37.220
from people from eBay that don't know about it.

02:34:37.220 --> 02:34:41.080
They buy the game you use for their son or something and then they figure out, you know,

02:34:41.080 --> 02:34:44.040
the son wants to play multiplayer and figure out they have to charge another $20 for it

02:34:44.040 --> 02:34:45.040
to get the multiplayer.

02:34:45.040 --> 02:34:46.040
Yeah.

02:34:46.040 --> 02:34:47.040
That's gonna be interesting to see the results on that.

02:34:47.040 --> 02:34:48.040
So...

02:34:48.040 --> 02:34:52.080
That's gonna be interesting as in about like a 20 car pile up on the side of the road.

02:34:52.080 --> 02:34:53.080
Alright, X-Link.

02:34:53.080 --> 02:34:54.080
Gotta let you go, buddy.

02:34:54.080 --> 02:34:55.080
Have a good one.

02:34:55.080 --> 02:34:56.080
No problem.

02:34:56.080 --> 02:34:57.080
You too.

02:34:57.080 --> 02:34:58.080
Bye.

02:34:58.080 --> 02:34:59.080
We just have call after call tonight.

02:34:59.080 --> 02:35:00.080
Let's go to another call.

02:35:00.080 --> 02:35:01.080
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:35:01.080 --> 02:35:02.080
Who's this?

02:35:02.080 --> 02:35:03.080
Hey, folks.

02:35:03.080 --> 02:35:04.080
It's SSJ100 Matt.

02:35:04.080 --> 02:35:05.080
Hi, SSJ100 Matt.

02:35:05.080 --> 02:35:07.960
What's on your mind tonight?

02:35:07.960 --> 02:35:08.960
Not much.

02:35:08.960 --> 02:35:10.280
Definitely not Halo Reach.

02:35:10.280 --> 02:35:15.160
But by the way, Zaku... keyboard Zaku cats are better.

02:35:15.160 --> 02:35:17.040
Oh, I see.

02:35:17.040 --> 02:35:19.880
When it talks about keyboard cat and dog cat, Zaku cat wins.

02:35:19.880 --> 02:35:20.880
That's fair.

02:35:20.880 --> 02:35:21.880
Did you say dog cat?

02:35:21.880 --> 02:35:22.880
Did I say dog cat?

02:35:22.880 --> 02:35:23.880
I probably did.

02:35:23.880 --> 02:35:24.880
You said dog cat?

02:35:24.880 --> 02:35:25.880
I probably did say dog cat.

02:35:25.880 --> 02:35:30.280
Well, you know, SSJ100 Matt now is gonna make me think of the whole shark and octopus videos

02:35:30.280 --> 02:35:35.760
with all the YouTubes he was linking tonight, which were A-plus videos, by the way.

02:35:35.760 --> 02:35:40.440
When you can get videos to get a laugh on a radio show, you've done a good job.

02:35:40.440 --> 02:35:41.440
Yeah.

02:35:41.440 --> 02:35:42.440
So...

02:35:42.440 --> 02:35:46.440
Actually, the one thing I did want to talk about is, that will actually get us to debate.

02:35:46.440 --> 02:35:51.240
You know, I'm talking about the... the USL madness going on in the forums.

02:35:51.240 --> 02:35:52.240
Uh-huh, yes.

02:35:52.240 --> 02:35:55.960
We played a little promo from Bresloh a little earlier.

02:35:55.960 --> 02:35:57.640
What do you think about what's going on there?

02:35:57.640 --> 02:35:58.640
Well, I'm just...

02:35:58.640 --> 02:36:03.800
I'm just kind of amazed at just the amount of, like, hate that's going on in there.

02:36:03.800 --> 02:36:09.640
Like, right now, Pokemon is beating Final Fantasy VII nine votes to four.

02:36:09.640 --> 02:36:10.640
Mm-hmm.

02:36:10.640 --> 02:36:16.240
Now, my question is, are a lot of people just voting against Final Fantasy VII because they

02:36:16.240 --> 02:36:20.800
just hate the fact that it's overhyped or...

02:36:20.800 --> 02:36:21.800
I don't know.

02:36:21.800 --> 02:36:27.480
I think there's, like, a large generation of, like, modern fans that really just do

02:36:27.480 --> 02:36:29.520
not like Final Fantasy VII.

02:36:29.520 --> 02:36:30.880
I think it's a little bit of both.

02:36:30.880 --> 02:36:34.720
I think you have some genuine Pokemon fans, but I think some of that is anti-Final Fantasy

02:36:34.720 --> 02:36:35.720
VII votes, too.

02:36:35.720 --> 02:36:39.360
I think, like, any great political race, there's something like that going on there.

02:36:39.360 --> 02:36:43.960
I wish there was more of a sampling of our audience voting in those polls, but what can

02:36:43.960 --> 02:36:44.960
you do?

02:36:44.960 --> 02:36:45.960
Yeah.

02:36:45.960 --> 02:36:50.000
I mean, obviously, you know, we got Symphony of the Night losing to Legend of Zelda, which,

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.320
you know, that's a good matchup, so...

02:36:52.320 --> 02:36:55.040
Yeah, you know, I can't get mad about that.

02:36:55.040 --> 02:36:57.160
To be honest, I can't get mad about the Pokemon one, too.

02:36:57.160 --> 02:36:59.080
I realize Pokemon has its rabid fanbase.

02:36:59.080 --> 02:37:02.560
I mean, the anime is still going, and it's been going for, what, like, at least, like,

02:37:02.560 --> 02:37:03.560
ten years now?

02:37:03.560 --> 02:37:06.040
I mean, the anime is just not losing steam, and I get it.

02:37:06.040 --> 02:37:07.040
You know, I don't...

02:37:07.040 --> 02:37:10.200
Like, if it was losing to a game like, I don't know, Blades of Steel...

02:37:10.200 --> 02:37:13.840
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on there.

02:37:13.840 --> 02:37:14.840
Hold on there.

02:37:14.840 --> 02:37:15.840
Listen here.

02:37:15.840 --> 02:37:16.840
Okay.

02:37:16.840 --> 02:37:17.840
I just wanted to start something.

02:37:17.840 --> 02:37:18.840
Yeah.

02:37:18.840 --> 02:37:23.600
But, um, no, I mean, my point is, you know, if you genuinely like Pokemon and think it's

02:37:23.600 --> 02:37:26.840
a better game, then I'm cool with that, but, you know, if you just, like, if you're boning

02:37:26.840 --> 02:37:32.840
against a game that, you know, just because it's overhyped or everyone likes it, you know,

02:37:32.840 --> 02:37:34.520
like you said, haters to the left.

02:37:34.520 --> 02:37:35.520
Yes, exactly.

02:37:35.520 --> 02:37:36.520
Haters gonna hate.

02:37:36.520 --> 02:37:39.800
You know, I'm okay with Final Fantasy VII taking a step back.

02:37:39.800 --> 02:37:40.800
I mean, it's what?

02:37:40.800 --> 02:37:43.840
We're down to, what, 32 games, so if it doesn't make the top 16, oh, well, it probably wouldn't

02:37:43.840 --> 02:37:45.160
be in my top 16, either.

02:37:45.160 --> 02:37:47.720
There's other Final Fantasy games I think were better than VII.

02:37:47.720 --> 02:37:51.440
I love Final Fantasy VI, I love Final Fantasy IV, I would place both those games, and I

02:37:51.440 --> 02:37:56.200
think VI is still in it, so, you know, I'm okay that if VII's out this round and one

02:37:56.200 --> 02:37:59.840
of the other Final Fantasy games continues, but what's weird about the whole setup of

02:37:59.840 --> 02:38:04.400
the way, and it's just, I guess, the way the cards fell, and I know Jon has this very specific

02:38:04.400 --> 02:38:10.520
way of seeding everything in the match, but it's really weird how, like, three Mario games

02:38:10.520 --> 02:38:16.720
and, like, three Zelda games are likely to take up the top 32.

02:38:16.720 --> 02:38:17.720
It's-

02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:21.240
Then again, you know, maybe Zelda and Mario shouldn't be so good.

02:38:21.240 --> 02:38:25.220
I know, I know they're good games, I get it, but it's just weird, and I think maybe I'm

02:38:25.220 --> 02:38:30.080
saying that because some of the games got grouped as series and some didn't, but I'm

02:38:30.080 --> 02:38:33.680
sure it had a lot to do with how people's lists were, like, I know, like, if you even

02:38:33.680 --> 02:38:37.060
look at my list, I probably did have two different Zelda games on it and two different Mario

02:38:37.060 --> 02:38:38.060
games on it.

02:38:38.060 --> 02:38:41.200
So, they are really good series, but it's just interesting that we're down to, like,

02:38:41.200 --> 02:38:44.920
you know, we're gonna be down to 16 and, like, half of that is gonna be Zelda and Mario.

02:38:44.920 --> 02:38:48.460
Hey, you know, listen, I put Blades of Steel as number one.

02:38:48.460 --> 02:38:49.460
I know you do.

02:38:49.460 --> 02:38:53.600
Kinda jokingly, but, you know, I, if you saw, you know, I wrote a ridiculous manifesto,

02:38:53.600 --> 02:38:54.600
just jokingly, but, you know.

02:38:54.600 --> 02:38:56.680
No, I know, and Blades of Steel was a great game.

02:38:56.680 --> 02:38:57.680
You know what?

02:38:57.680 --> 02:38:58.680
I don't play a lot of sports games.

02:38:58.680 --> 02:39:01.320
I really don't, but I owned Blades of Steel on the NES.

02:39:01.320 --> 02:39:02.320
That's how good it was.

02:39:02.320 --> 02:39:03.320
It was a great game.

02:39:03.320 --> 02:39:04.320
Exactly.

02:39:04.320 --> 02:39:05.320
And it had Groddies.

02:39:05.320 --> 02:39:06.320
Only sports games I've ever known.

02:39:06.320 --> 02:39:07.320
Groddies minigame.

02:39:07.320 --> 02:39:08.320
So, we're gonna wrap things up.

02:39:08.320 --> 02:39:09.320
But thanks so much for your call.

02:39:09.320 --> 02:39:10.320
Yup.

02:39:10.320 --> 02:39:11.320
Take it easy.

02:39:11.320 --> 02:39:12.320
Have a good one.

02:39:12.320 --> 02:39:13.320
All right.

02:39:13.320 --> 02:39:14.320
Apologies to those that didn't get through tonight.

02:39:14.320 --> 02:39:15.320
We took, like, four calls tonight.

02:39:15.320 --> 02:39:19.680
Usually, when I take three, so, uh, send us an email if you didn't get through or a tweet.

02:39:19.680 --> 02:39:23.460
We always appreciate those and, uh, we'll talk to you guys, hopefully, next time on

02:39:23.460 --> 02:39:26.520
Orange Lounge Radio, but many, many different ways to interact with the show.

02:39:26.520 --> 02:39:29.960
Chat room, Twitter, all that good stuff.

02:39:29.960 --> 02:39:33.840
I'm glad, I think all the calls we got tonight were people that weren't on last week, so

02:39:33.840 --> 02:39:36.720
it's good to kind of, or maybe Zaku was, I don't know, but it's good to kind of spread

02:39:36.720 --> 02:39:37.720
the love a little bit.

02:39:37.720 --> 02:39:38.720
So.

02:39:38.720 --> 02:39:39.720
All right.

02:39:39.720 --> 02:39:42.080
Um, we're gonna go around and, uh, kind of start to wrap up the show, but first we gotta

02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:44.320
make sure all of our last minute stories are cleared out.

02:39:44.320 --> 02:39:46.800
Uh, anything else you guys want to bring up tonight, Loki?

02:39:46.800 --> 02:39:47.800
Dark Sakura?

02:39:47.800 --> 02:39:49.800
I like chocolate.

02:39:49.800 --> 02:39:51.800
That's not a news breaking story.

02:39:51.800 --> 02:39:59.000
There's a few things, uh, from, um, AOU 2010, uh, the Arcade Expo that's in, uh, Japan.

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:02.240
They're showing off some of the new things including Sega is bringing, uh, Project Diva

02:40:02.240 --> 02:40:03.240
to the arcades.

02:40:03.240 --> 02:40:04.240
Yay!

02:40:04.240 --> 02:40:12.920
Um, rhythm music game kind of looks a little bit like a cross between, um, I don't know,

02:40:12.920 --> 02:40:20.560
something like maybe like a per-appetite game with, um, oh wow, that Namco singing game.

02:40:20.560 --> 02:40:21.560
I don't know.

02:40:21.560 --> 02:40:26.320
Basically, it's just, you know, like a music rhythm game with, uh, chicks singing stuff.

02:40:26.320 --> 02:40:27.800
Um, it looks neat.

02:40:27.800 --> 02:40:31.860
It's got these, um, not really popping music buttons, but it's basically got four buttons

02:40:31.860 --> 02:40:36.620
that kind of match the, uh, PlayStation face buttons.

02:40:36.620 --> 02:40:38.080
So that's kind of neat.

02:40:38.080 --> 02:40:41.440
And that'll become an arcades imagined pretty soon.

02:40:41.440 --> 02:40:46.280
Uh, another one that they showed off that was actually really huge, um, was Metal Gear

02:40:46.280 --> 02:40:47.280
Arcade.

02:40:47.280 --> 02:40:50.040
With, talk about one hell of a complex cabinet.

02:40:50.040 --> 02:40:51.760
Oh yeah, I've heard about this.

02:40:51.760 --> 02:40:59.700
It's got, like, these 3D glasses, head tracking, um, built into those, like, it's like a goggle

02:40:59.700 --> 02:41:00.700
type thing.

02:41:00.700 --> 02:41:07.920
Um, you have a gun that you use and just talk about, well, that's just begging to get broken.

02:41:07.920 --> 02:41:09.720
Yeah, talk about details.

02:41:09.720 --> 02:41:11.720
So that's kind of cool.

02:41:11.720 --> 02:41:14.760
Um, I don't know when that's going to be coming out.

02:41:14.760 --> 02:41:20.000
Uh, then we were talking, there's, uh, apparently there was some concern because of the rumors

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:23.800
that Final Fantasy XIV is coming out this year, that Final Fantasy XI will be going

02:41:23.800 --> 02:41:26.520
by the wayside, um, with the release of that.

02:41:26.520 --> 02:41:27.880
Is that for real?

02:41:27.880 --> 02:41:31.980
Because I, I did remember before I had no internet after the move, I remember reading

02:41:31.980 --> 02:41:35.360
that story and I was like, there's no official word from Square Enix, this seems like a rumor

02:41:35.360 --> 02:41:36.360
run wild.

02:41:36.360 --> 02:41:39.400
It just, uh, well, that's the thing, it's, it's not, it's not going to be going by the

02:41:39.400 --> 02:41:40.400
wayside.

02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:41.400
Oh, thank God.

02:41:41.400 --> 02:41:45.680
Uh, Wada, uh, tweeted, uh, there seems to be a rumor that Final Fantasy XI is ending,

02:41:45.680 --> 02:41:49.200
but if that was done, we're, uh, we'd be in trouble.

02:41:49.200 --> 02:41:50.200
Um.

02:41:50.200 --> 02:41:52.920
Well, if it's on Twitter, then you know it's true.

02:41:52.920 --> 02:41:56.780
If it's coming from, you know, uh, Yoji Wada.

02:41:56.780 --> 02:42:01.340
In this case, if it's coming from a verified dude's account, I think there's really no

02:42:01.340 --> 02:42:02.340
dispute in that, I guess.

02:42:02.340 --> 02:42:03.340
Yoji Wada.

02:42:03.340 --> 02:42:08.260
Um, so I guess, no, they can't shut down 11 right now just to make room for 14 EverQuest

02:42:08.260 --> 02:42:12.640
one and two ran at the same time and you know, all these other ones that have sequels, city

02:42:12.640 --> 02:42:14.900
heroes and villains are running at the same time.

02:42:14.900 --> 02:42:18.260
You know, one's not going to close because the other is out.

02:42:18.260 --> 02:42:23.680
Might there be server consolidations because there's going to be a, yeah, that could happen

02:42:23.680 --> 02:42:24.680
and probably will happen.

02:42:24.680 --> 02:42:28.880
I bet 11 has a server consolidation by the end of the year, but it's not going to close.

02:42:28.880 --> 02:42:29.880
Not going to close.

02:42:29.880 --> 02:42:35.400
Um, and then the last thing, um, you remember, uh, that we mentioned that Perfect Dark would

02:42:35.400 --> 02:42:37.880
be coming to Xbox Live Arcade during March.

02:42:37.880 --> 02:42:45.540
Well with that will be the GoldenEye 007 maps from, um, the game on Nintendo 64.

02:42:45.540 --> 02:42:49.000
Those will be also coming to Perfect Dark as well as possibly the weapons.

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:54.240
Sneaky, sneaky, sneaky way to get GoldenEye content on the Xbox without having to do all

02:42:54.240 --> 02:42:55.240
the licenses.

02:42:55.240 --> 02:42:56.240
There you go.

02:42:56.240 --> 02:42:57.240
I like the way they think.

02:42:57.240 --> 02:42:58.240
Next best thing.

02:42:58.240 --> 02:42:59.240
Good job.

02:42:59.240 --> 02:43:00.240
That's it.

02:43:00.240 --> 02:43:01.240
All right.

02:43:01.240 --> 02:43:04.920
Well, if that does it for a last minute stories, then it's the part of the show.

02:43:04.920 --> 02:43:08.060
We're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:43:08.060 --> 02:43:09.760
So Alan, we'll start with you.

02:43:09.760 --> 02:43:11.360
Thank you so much for coming and being on the show tonight.

02:43:11.360 --> 02:43:15.800
I know you didn't get to say a whole lot, but I hope you had fun sitting in here and

02:43:15.800 --> 02:43:16.800
sitting in.

02:43:16.800 --> 02:43:17.800
Thanks for having me.

02:43:17.800 --> 02:43:18.800
No problem.

02:43:18.800 --> 02:43:21.360
Come again sometime and, and, and don't be afraid to speak your mind.

02:43:21.360 --> 02:43:23.880
It's where every gamer has a voice, Alan, even yours.

02:43:23.880 --> 02:43:25.760
So do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

02:43:25.760 --> 02:43:27.840
My cat's breath smells like cat food.

02:43:27.840 --> 02:43:28.840
Okay.

02:43:28.840 --> 02:43:29.840
Yeah.

02:43:29.840 --> 02:43:30.840
Uh, Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:43:30.840 --> 02:43:35.640
Uh, my final thought is I get to take off work tomorrow cause I am sick.

02:43:35.640 --> 02:43:40.920
My final thought is looking at the Dragon Quest slime on Dan's desk kind of makes me

02:43:40.920 --> 02:43:42.600
want to play Dragon Quest eight.

02:43:42.600 --> 02:43:44.960
I don't know why, but it was kind of cool.

02:43:44.960 --> 02:43:46.640
Dark Sakura, your final thought.

02:43:46.640 --> 02:43:53.440
I'm totally addicted to this, uh, Sailor Senshi doll maker.

02:43:53.440 --> 02:43:57.360
You are the reason Ubisoft has a market for those designer dress games.

02:43:57.360 --> 02:43:58.360
No, I'm kidding.

02:43:58.360 --> 02:44:00.160
Uh, probably you're right.

02:44:00.160 --> 02:44:02.760
Actually, I'm kind of jealous watching you play.

02:44:02.760 --> 02:44:07.480
No, thanks a lot of course for tuning into our show and supporting and downloading and

02:44:07.480 --> 02:44:08.960
listening to independent radio.

02:44:08.960 --> 02:44:09.960
We really appreciate it.

02:44:09.960 --> 02:44:11.200
We do this show for free.

02:44:11.200 --> 02:44:14.920
All we ask if you enjoyed what you heard, tell a friend about the show, help spread

02:44:14.920 --> 02:44:16.360
the word about orange lounge radio.

02:44:16.360 --> 02:44:17.740
We really appreciate it.

02:44:17.740 --> 02:44:22.000
And you know what, you know what else helps leaving reviews on iTunes or links.

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:26.600
Some of you plug us in like forum signatures and stuff, even if it's like a little banner

02:44:26.600 --> 02:44:28.040
that's like, I listen to LR.

02:44:28.040 --> 02:44:31.920
We think that kind of stuff is really cool and really makes the, this whole thing worth

02:44:31.920 --> 02:44:32.920
it.

02:44:32.920 --> 02:44:36.280
So, uh, uh, even when it's an off night like tonight, but you know what, the whole chat

02:44:36.280 --> 02:44:37.440
room seems to be into it.

02:44:37.440 --> 02:44:38.440
So Hey, good times.

02:44:38.440 --> 02:44:39.880
Uh, thank you guys.

02:44:39.880 --> 02:44:42.960
We really appreciate the support and we'll be back to do it all again next week.

02:44:42.960 --> 02:44:44.600
What do you guys think?

02:44:44.600 --> 02:44:45.600
Why not?

02:44:45.600 --> 02:44:46.600
Why not?

02:44:46.600 --> 02:44:50.600
So for myself, Alan, Loki, Jamie and Shermy, good night.

02:44:50.600 --> 02:44:54.600
You've been listening to orange lounge radio.

02:44:54.600 --> 02:45:00.360
Orange lounge radio is an orange lounge production to join us for a live show.

02:45:00.360 --> 02:45:08.840
Visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6 PM Pacific time, the views and opinions expressed

02:45:08.840 --> 02:45:13.720
on orange lounge radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff of orange

02:45:13.720 --> 02:45:18.680
lounge radio or all games.com, but we're probably right anyway.

02:45:18.680 --> 02:45:20.680
See you next week.
