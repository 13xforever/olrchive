13971	18417	Tonight, February 28th, 2010, which country has banned Heavy Rain?
18438	25047	A date is announced for the Final Fantasy XIV beta, and a Nintendo press event brings us a barrage of Wii and DS news.
31294	42237	Hello my friends and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, that talk show on the internet, live every Sunday night, dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42257	44477	It is the show where every gamer has a voice.
44497	54540	We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern Time at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.
54560	57741	A big thanks to them for letting us steal their bandwidth every single week.
58174	58274	Meh.
64568	64928	Meh.
65048	65428	Meh.
65768	66428	Meh.
67408	70649	I have one thing to say to the California government.
70789	71069	Meh.
71809	72089	Fuck.
72389	74890	I'll get into that in a little bit during housekeeping, absolutely.
75370	76830	If you wonder what she's talking about.
77110	79651	And it's not just an unbalanced budget, but there's other stuff going on.
79671	80411	You've probably heard.
80771	83591	I think it's made those water cooler press stories this week.
84111	86092	And boy, do we have the response for you.
86112	87252	We're going to get into that in a little bit.
88312	90272	We do talk games too, right, Tech Master Loki?
90452	91513	Also here joining us every week.
91693	92413	Yeah, every now and then.
92593	93153	How you doing, Loki?
93573	94794	I'm doing okay Yeah, I'm boycotting him
123607	125208	Nobody with any taste is.
126029	127410	My grandma's happy, I'll tell you that.
127790	129872	Alright, let's get into our gaming weeks.
129932	140961	Yes, once in a while we do talk about video games here, and we let the gamers have a voice in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, but don't worry, if you're not listening live, if you're listening on the podcast feed, there are a million billion ways to communicate with the show.
141061	143763	If there's a social network for it, we're probably on it somewhere.
144504	150089	The Twitters, the Facebooks, we take emails every week, all of it, and phone calls later on too, so...
150789	151490	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
174945	181012	I've had lots of homework to do and lots of responsibilities to take care of, so I haven't really played anything.
181052	182333	Well, you've got to take a break once in a while.
182734	188560	Although I've tried to play my Sims 3 and it probably hates my mods, so I have to reinstall it, so whatever.
189622	190463	Well, Loki, how about you?
190503	191544	Have you been playing anything this week?
192861	194122	Just a lot of Borderlands.
195423	200287	I've been trying to go through and finish Mad Moxie's Underdome.
200867	205811	And unfortunately didn't get a chance to do that because the ones I'm on now are the 20 round matches.
205991	211276	Which each round has 5 waves in it and it takes forever.
211596	211856	So...
213257	217879	Unfortunately, I made it only through seven rounds before I realized I'm not going to be able to finish it in the time that I had.
217959	221780	So I quit that and played a little bit more just the standard campaign now.
221840	228163	But I'm almost maxed out as far as my level goes.
228423	234605	But I am kind of trying to collect some weapons and stuff because I downloaded the new expansion.
236646	239687	And unfortunately, the new expansion kills any mods that you have.
240427	240728	So...
242108	243770	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
263567	263867	I don't know.
264288	264728	It'll be fun.
266050	267952	And then, of course, more Grand Theft Auto.
268793	270515	And doing well on that.
270595	272518	Still trying to move up the leaderboards.
273579	280627	And I broke 200 now for cumulative ranked deathmatches.
283056	293806	I'm, I think, almost like in the 60s for TrueSkill rankings, so it's going pretty well.
293846	295307	I'll be up there pretty soon.
295608	300092	The only problem is, though, is those guys that are actually in the top of the TrueSkill ranks...
300652	304935	They tend not to want to play games that they're losing.
305376	309719	Apparently they drop out and so their rank doesn't go down.
310600	312762	So I actually did run into some people.
312782	318126	I actually ran into the number one player and the number six player and both of them did not want to play me.
319207	321028	Which is too bad because I would have kicked the crap out of them.
322169	322509	That's it.
323030	323931	That's what I'm playing this week.
324711	325892	And you still have a cold.
325932	327874	You were sick last week and you're still sick.
328475	329416	Are you feeling okay?
330276	331357	Do you need some medication?
331678	332218	No, I'm fine.
332238	333700	I took two days off this week.
334741	336162	That's where I play a lot of Borderlands.
338004	338944	And did other things.
341346	344108	You can't really go into that because wife would not be happy.
344808	345389	Alright then.
346429	346750	Fine.
347210	348310	Okay, my gaming week.
348411	352653	Actually, I had a week similar to Jamie's where a lot of real life stuff is coming into play.
353113	357556	I'm still working on the whole moving thing which will be done like tomorrow, so thankfully.
358676	359817	But I did play a little bit.
359857	361578	I did get into World of Warcraft, of course.
362479	364500	My boyfriend and I have been leveling together.
364540	366301	I helped him kind of get started with the character.
366341	367061	Actually, no, I take that back.
367121	369643	He started the character and by the time it got to about...
370383	372804	about level 21, I don't remember, 23, somewhere in there.
372824	376066	We started leveling together and now we just hit 50 this weekend.
376106	377546	So yay to leveling.
377627	380148	It's kind of fun to have somebody to always play WoW with.
380228	380868	It's cool.
380968	388792	You know, I'm really trying to get as much Borderlands in this week because I have a feeling I'm going to have Final Fantasy XIII by the end of this week and oh my god, everything's going to stop.
388892	389392	Wait, wait, wait.
389432	391593	Is your connection getting that early?
391613	393674	Because I want to place an order if so.
396195	398936	I don't know if we have extras, but I will check.
423109	429131	We had this story where it came up at some point during the show that the former Midway games had all disappeared from Xbox Live.
429211	430512	Joust and Smash TV.
430812	433013	So I had a night where I just decided to play a bunch of retro games.
433053	434213	I went in and I played Joust.
434233	436174	I don't think I actually played Smash TV.
436594	439075	I started playing Gyruss for a while for some weird reason.
439496	441036	Well, it's not a weird reason.
441056	441877	I just really love that game.
441897	443297	It's one of my favorite shooters from the 80s.
443777	446699	I actually beat my former high score, which isn't very good.
446759	447519	I need to work on it.
447899	453941	You know, Gyruss and a lot of the old arcade games, admittedly, is all about memorization, like knowing where the ships come from in every wave.
454341	456681	So I just really need to kind of work on it for a little while.
456721	457761	But I got a better score.
457781	458482	So that made me happy.
458522	461202	I think I beat my score on another old game, too.
461242	462443	And I can't remember which one it was.
462463	464763	I don't remember if it was Time Pilot or no, I think it was like Tempest.
465303	466984	Again, though, my score is still not very good.
467024	467724	I need to work on it.
467984	475448	Yeah, as I mentioned, one of the things I did while I was sick is worked on something that my wife would not like.
475868	479310	And that is I'm building up our top arcade cabinet for work.
480430	482771	So that's actually coming along pretty well.
482831	483532	It looks pretty nice.
484332	486953	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
508522	510343	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
531693	537065	But for some reason, the Naomi version of Marvel vs. Capcom 2 still has slowdowns in it.
537145	541354	But it's not by my computer because it's certainly fast enough.
542628	545729	Let me ask kind of like a random MAME question, because I'm going to be honest.
545789	549711	I haven't played MAME, the arcade emulator, in quite a long time.
551071	558354	Did it ever get to the point where it does more things online, like the exchange of high scores or an online leaderboard or something?
558594	564156	Because I really see that as being some of the big appeal of Game Room to me, the legitimate MAME or whatever you want to call it.
564516	570018	I think it's really cool that I'm going to have leaderboards with friends and some of that medals and achievements element.
570318	571559	MAME is just...
572259	572979	and DarkSakura.com
602392	609258	They do have patches now that will save your high scores, but nothing that you can play online with each other.
609318	620027	There's other programs out there like Mess or Misfit Mame, which will run all sorts of hacked games.
621268	626853	Maybe those will have some sort of online play or something, but Mame does not.
627513	633699	Honestly, it does make sense, though, that there's not a lot of frills because MAME is sort of in that really gray area of legality as it is.
633739	641607	I mean, there's nothing wrong with the MAME program itself, but it's the fact that the ROMs are not legal except for a handful.
641647	645591	There have been a few that the original creators of the game have come back and said...
645991	649972	Yeah, that was like 25 years ago, and we're not going to make any money off of it.
650012	652793	So we hereby release it in the public domain.
652813	653513	Woohoo, have fun.
653553	655114	There have been a handful of those games.
655654	664716	So I think if MAME were to come in and say, oh, we're going to implement this online leaderboard for this game, it would really kind of start to push the boundaries of the gray area of legality.
664736	665656	It would just be tough.
665676	669457	It'd be tough to do it, and it'd be tough to make sure people aren't cheating in it.
669677	669878	True.
671518	672318	It'd just be too difficult.
672378	674359	But I do believe, actually, that...
676321	683471	I think Macaron or maybe Demol, one of the Dreamcast emulators, is actually doing online.
683692	686075	You can play multiplayer over the internet.
686235	686816	Now that's cool.
687277	690882	And I know those do Naomi games, so like Marvel vs. Capcom 2 or...
691840	694163	Did they ever perfect it on the NES or SNES?
707222	708382	I think those have gotten better.
708522	708822	I don't know.
708842	710263	I don't play over the internet with that stuff.
710403	711003	The same with MAME.
711023	713684	I mean, it's my cabinet.
714044	717265	Unfortunately, the motherboard in it is really cheap.
717785	721066	And so, anytime I overclock it, the ethernet stops working.
721606	726167	Well, I've always said I would love Nintendo's Virtual Console if it was on Xbox Live.
729028	736493	Well, we're going to get into this more later, but I'm honestly surprised at the release schedule that they have right now, so maybe they are coming around.
737053	748180	I mean, because that's basically all the games that they announced at E3 coming out before E3 this year, so it's like, okay, clean slate, what are you going to announce for the rest of the year, you know?
748880	750301	Yeah, we'll get into that a little bit, though.
750341	752723	Before we get into the gaming news, let me do some housekeeping tonight.
752743	757247	We don't have a whole lot of housekeeping here in-house, but something DarkSakura referenced a little earlier in the show.
757287	759628	I just kind of wanted to share this and throw this out there with you guys.
760229	768095	Apparently, the California State Assembly passed a measure this week that is going to support anti-swearing week, or what do they call it?
768195	769256	No cussing week, right?
769276	769996	The first week of March.
770016	770717	Yeah, something like that.
770797	774160	So starting Monday, because today's the last day of February, believe it or not.
774180	776922	So starting Monday, it is no cuss week in California.
777322	782248	So if you so much as say fuck out loud, you're going to get hauled off to jail.
782748	784070	No, okay, it's not really like that.
784110	785491	What it is, I don't know.
786052	792960	Some kid in a club in California started this no cussing club.
793380	819776	and it caught on amongst all these people that think if you cuss then clearly you're not intelligent because only unintelligent people have to fill their vocabulary with cuss words blah blah blah I don't know something along those lines so somehow this got all the way to the state assembly while we are in the midst of a budget crisis yet again mind you and you know we can't even go to the DMV anymore because we're not even sure when they're actually open because they're closed half the time anyway sorry I don't want to get on the political tangent here too much
820877	833653	So they found time to pass this resolution to support the No Cussing Week, and they're encouraging that everybody should keep a swear jar, and you should, you know, where if you say fuck or damn or whatever, you should put in 25 cents into the swear jar.
834715	834935	So...
836597	852334	Yeah, and you should donate this to charity, to Haiti or probably Chile now, and obviously our thoughts to everybody who was affected by that recent thing, and I don't have a problem with donating to charity, but I think I have a little bit of a problem with...
852995	857716	You know, the government endorsing something that sort of infringes on freedom of speech.
857796	858876	I mean, call me crazy.
859516	864617	And if you look at this dude's website for the No Cussing Club, they're selling books.
865057	868078	They're selling charters on how to start your own club.
868378	870819	Gee, the guy's profiting off this idea.
873059	873739	Are they taxing him?
874079	874479	I hope so.
875080	875860	Well, you know what?
876520	881841	You can't knock him for profiting off of it because if people are dumb enough to pay him for it, then...
883635	883935	Whatever.
883955	887137	I mean, that's what capitalism is built on.
887677	888877	Profiting off the stupid.
889538	891098	This state is... I'm sorry.
891118	897721	Again, I don't mean to get on the political train, but this does affect video games because this is the home of Silicon Valley and where a lot of the games are made.
897801	901683	So if the state goes belly up, so are a lot of your favorite game publishers.
902363	905866	I'm sorry, but this non-cussing week is about as...
921523	924766	Talk Like a Pirate Day has not been endorsed by the state of California.
924826	928368	Talk Like a Pirate Day is an internet meme, basically, that's gone crazy.
928989	929729	Yeah, exactly.
929749	930870	Is it a 4chan thing?
931150	932251	It might as well be.
932311	933132	It's one of those things.
933372	944841	It's basically about that important as far as... I would say even less important than Talk Like a Pirate Day because that's actually kind of cool.
944901	946121	It's about that important like...
948323	948804	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
957182	957622	Who cares?
979304	1002888	I can say them and nobody can take that right away because I live in America which is great but I'm glad you brought that up because next week's show will fall during No Cussing Week so I do want to point out we here at OLR we do have our plan and we are going to bring you OLR Presents our No Cussing Week show next week so we're looking very much forward to that so stay tuned so OLR celebrates No Cussing Week in the state of California next week
1003448	1003909	Celebrate?
1003949	1008295	But why are we giving them more fuel for their fire?
1008555	1009076	It'll be fun.
1011539	1013822	We like to challenge ourselves here at Orange Lounge Radio.
1014804	1016927	Let's challenge ourselves with some video game news tonight.
1016987	1017287	Loki.
1019109	1020409	I don't want to fucking do it.
1024570	1025511	Sorry, I had to get that out of there.
1026011	1029772	Anyways, so this is kind of interesting.
1030112	1040514	Apparently, the PS3 developers have now 70 megabytes of additional RAM unlocked to be able to use in their games.
1041494	1063049	Sony apparently has been upgrading the PS3 over the past few months and doing so they've dropped the OS's memory footprint from 120 megabytes to 50 megabytes and basically allowing the system to use less RAM and therefore being able to pass on the RAM to other developers.
1063589	1067252	Now, is that going to really make a difference?
1067892	1068413	Probably not.
1068473	1068773	I mean...
1070968	1072149	It'll help.
1072770	1080356	They won't have to optimize their code as much, but as PS3 developers have basically said, any bit of RAM helps.
1081798	1081998	Neat.
1083581	1088843	Yeah, I guess a little bit of RAM is better than none, but, well, I mean, sorry.
1089183	1091904	Obviously, there is RAM in the system as it is, but you know what I mean.
1092124	1093045	The more RAM, the merrier.
1093525	1100868	But how is it that this console's been out for so long, and now they're saying, hey, we've unlocked this hidden RAM.
1101188	1104009	Is it just because they've optimized processes and systems?
1104049	1107751	Yeah, they've just optimized their operating system.
1107791	1113193	They basically found new ways to do different things, and now, because it's optimized, they don't need as much RAM.
1115239	1120202	But I wouldn't expect that suddenly all these games are going to have uber better graphics and all this stuff.
1120242	1123083	I mean, 70 megs of RAM is not that much when all is said and done.
1123103	1129187	So that's going to be like an extra, maybe an extra splish splash in the water effect or an extra little dangling light somewhere in Silent Hill.
1129207	1129687	Probably not anything.
1129707	1140573	I'm surprised they're not using it for like, you know, more features in the operating system, you know, custom soundtracks in all the games, you know.
1141273	1145236	and CrossGameChat, which I think is still there now, hopefully.
1146697	1148759	You know, video chat or something like that.
1148779	1149159	I don't know.
1150120	1151380	They could be using that RAM for something.
1152842	1153582	Or, I don't know.
1153742	1154303	Let's see.
1155443	1159626	These consoles, you know, have been out for a while and put more RAM in them.
1160627	1165591	You know, like gigs of RAM instead of like half a gig or whatever the hell's in these.
1165811	1167372	I know it's not more than a gig.
1169335	1188896	it's pathetic but they can't up it after the console's already out because then the games that are released may not work on the older system so it's just like you have a new console out there like remember like I'm thinking of the Nintendo 64 memory pack like didn't you have to have that little memory pack in order to play like Majora's Mask I think was the biggest game with that
1189204	1201668	Some games, yes, but here's the thing is, like the PSP, they double the RAM that they have for their, well, it's mainly for their web browser, but it can be done.
1201888	1206070	I mean, all it would do is those games would run smoother.
1206850	1210311	I see, but games would still have to be optimized for the lowest common denominator, really.
1210471	1210691	Yes.
1211192	1212832	Or else they're going to find themselves in trouble.
1212992	1217194	But eventually they would phase that out, you know, phase out the old systems and...
1218274	1226178	Alright, well one system that doesn't seem to be getting any upgrades in its near future is the Nintendo Wii, but that doesn't stop Nintendo from trying to crank out the big, big games.
1226538	1230320	And they had a big press event this week, we're going to focus on the next few stories talking about for a moment.
1231341	1234522	And of course some big, big titles coming out of this press event that happened this week.
1235623	1264544	two of them being Mario Galaxy 2 and Metroid Other M sounds like Super Mario Galaxy 2 and Metroid Other M are both going to be out mid-year which was a little bit of a surprise because I think a lot of us were thinking even though Other M was shown at last E3 we were kind of thinking oh it's early it's going to be out this holiday season but no both these games have now been dated for mid-year so Mario Galaxy 2 I believe they've said they've even said like what May I think and Metroid Other M is going to be out in June yes
1264844	1267886	So, June 27th, which is the day after my birthday, I believe.
1268407	1274311	So, you know, it's kind of exciting these games are coming out so soon, but what's that mean for the rest of the year?
1274751	1276652	What big titles does Nintendo have left?
1276752	1279794	They've already hinted that they're going to announce a new Zelda game that's going to come out at the end of the year.
1279894	1281536	I mean, that's basically what's going to happen.
1281556	1284338	You're going to have a new Zelda game, probably running in the Twilight Princess engine.
1285919	1288260	And that'll be the new game this year.
1288701	1290322	And everyone will go buck wild over it.
1291122	1300026	So, I guess some of the early impressions are out over these games, and Super Mario Galaxy 2 is pretty much Super Mario Galaxy 1, but some new worlds and new features and things.
1300566	1301987	Not a lot of differences, though.
1302027	1303407	It's not like the game has suddenly changed.
1303427	1304328	I don't think it has to be.
1304788	1307249	As long as it has Be Mario, who's going to care?
1307269	1312611	Really, it was a good game, so you don't really need to change it.
1314406	1335285	Metroid Other M, on the other hand, finally we're getting some more details out of that, and it does sound like it's going to be a direct sequel to Super Metroid, which you know has me excited, because I think Super Metroid's the greatest game they ever made, so hearing that this is a direct sequel, well, I do also approach that with caution, because there's a part of me that goes, they could really screw this up, but apparently they have a whole rendered...
1335985	1337967	I'm certainly excited about Metroid Other M. I...
1361747	1366010	If it is mostly a 2D Metroid especially, I'm really excited.
1366050	1369291	I mean, I'm cool with them throwing some 3D in there a la Paper Mario.
1370292	1376035	And, you know, it's not that Prime was bad, but it's just I love Super Metroid and can't wait to see a game like that.
1376135	1380578	So I'm sure we'll see more details on this in the coming months because this game is going to be out now.
1380978	1381839	What, we're looking at March?
1381879	1382819	This game's out in three months.
1383319	1383519	Yeah.
1384000	1384360	Crazy.
1387216	1403912	and actually we're getting linked to something on YouTube I'm hoping this isn't a joke but it comes from Tiger Claw saying the Metroid Other M intro video was apparently leaked oh yeah somebody's got their little camera here at the press conference so Tiger Claw just linked this in our chat room
1405703	1411987	I'm trying to see, and I apologize because I know video doesn't make for great radio, but okay, we see nebulas and clouds and all that stuff here.
1412007	1414408	Let me skip forward a little more in the video.
1416129	1422613	Now, whoever's holding their camera is having to hold it a little low, but we do see kind of like a rendered Samus in 3D.
1422633	1425115	Actually, those graphics look really good, especially for the Wii.
1426713	1429274	I know Nintendo's hoping this will be the game that changes people's minds.
1429595	1432596	Oh, there's the baby Metroid from the end of Super Metroid.
1432636	1433417	Isn't it cute?
1433517	1434457	And the mother brain.
1435057	1435598	Oh, wow.
1436138	1437659	That actually does look pretty impressive.
1437859	1440200	Oh, remember how the boss shot the laser from her eye and everything?
1441581	1442601	Interesting.
1445063	1446083	That's pretty cool.
1447064	1450846	Ooh, whoever leaked that little piece of footage is gonna get busted, but that's really awesome.
1452587	1453007	That's cool.
1454633	1459296	If you want to check that out, the YouTube user that has this video posted right now is MetroidBlaster127.
1459676	1464138	That's where we got linked to by our chat room.
1464198	1468160	I gotta say, maybe this will be the game that changes people's minds on the Wii.
1468661	1469041	I don't know.
1471322	1477946	Well, it's not necessarily that my mind needs to be changed because Nintendo does put out that one or two awesome games a year.
1478226	1482408	If this does well, let's see a Team Ninja Zelda game or a Team Ninja Mario game.
1483925	1484245	DarkSakura
1509736	1512718	Well, this is about the DSi XL.
1513138	1514880	We've got a date and a price for it.
1514940	1517161	It looks like it's going to be out on March 28th.
1517261	1521724	It's going to be $190, and I'm pretty sure I don't know if I'm going to get one.
1523705	1527548	Aren't they saying that a new DS is kind of rumored for E3 this year?
1527588	1529509	Like that could be one of the things that they announce?
1530610	1534232	Yeah, it's supposed to be one for $189.99.
1534773	1538976	I'm going to laugh if they do release a new one right after they do this.
1539856	1542037	Well, I know we've gotten into this on the show before.
1542097	1544558	They did the micro after the DS was announced.
1544578	1545018	I liked my micro.
1545078	1547599	I honestly don't think that they need to do another DS.
1547639	1554062	I mean, granted, the XL, whatever, people might want a larger screen for something.
1554082	1554542	I don't know.
1554562	1559744	They're kind of posing this as like a secondhand e-book reader or something like that.
1559764	1566487	In fact, I think one of the new pieces of software they're going to have with this is like some sort of classic novel collection or something like that.
1566768	1567491	I could be interesting.
1568034	1568757	I would get that.
1569139	1570064	Then again, I use my Kindle.
1570427	1571588	It wasn't this game.
1571628	1577533	There was actually a... Or it wasn't the DSi XL that was necessarily kind of cool.
1577633	1590004	There was a... I want to say it's a new DSiWare game that's going to be coming out where it's like a hidden pictures game that you have to search for different letters in this scene.
1590544	1595048	But what's kind of cool about it though is they almost do a pseudo head tracking with it using the camera.
1595388	1598511	You actually tilt the system around and the camera changes angles
1599151	1620895	Based on how you have the system tilted Why don't they do this technology with DSi That might make it a lot cooler With different games coming out That you have this neat little Head tracking technology built in That would be really cool And kind of a way to differentiate Themselves with DSi Because right now it's like It's a DS with a camera They don't like to give us what we want
1621826	1624329	You know, another big problem with this is the price.
1624649	1626471	I mean, $200, right?
1626511	1627633	Or $190 or whatever it is.
1627833	1633759	Something like that is supposed to be like $20 more than what the DSi is now.
1634020	1635241	Yeah, it's stupid.
1635501	1638845	But now you're also talking you could get a Wii for the same price, right?
1638885	1640407	Or at least an Xbox 360 low-end, right?
1640427	1640567	For $199.
1643650	1644812	So, I don't know.
1644852	1647795	I'm not really sold on, again, why I need the DSi XL.
1648176	1649277	I don't have a DSi.
1649617	1650118	I don't have one.
1650158	1652621	I have the DS Lite, was the last Nintendo system I bought.
1653422	1659308	And I probably wouldn't have even bought that if I hadn't kind of bought it as like a knee-jerk thing when I was on vacation once.
1659469	1659609	This...
1660149	1661130	I would still have my DS fat.
1688232	1689473	I don't understand the point of this.
1716281	1723610	Ooh, maybe they're in pretty colors, because that would be a big seller, as if they're in fabulous pink and sexy lavender.
1723630	1730659	Well, I don't know what the colors are going to be, but I think from what we've seen in the pictures, it's like they have a wine burgundy color.
1730839	1732061	Yeah, and another one's bronze.
1733002	1733743	I'd get a bronze one.
1734905	1735025	It's...
1736614	1741956	It's so like a third place looking color and then a Franzia looking color.
1743196	1749178	Really, if you want a DSi in a specific color, there are websites out there that will give you a DSi in any color you want.
1749598	1753659	Or you can go to Nintendo World Store in New York and they'll give you a DSi color.
1753839	1755560	I almost did that.
1755660	1761782	They had like the custom DS cases and really there was a sexy metallic green one I kind of wanted but I resisted.
1761822	1762382	I didn't buy it.
1763408	1792206	Almost As you should have because you probably already have a DS And there's no reason to purchase something because of the color There really wasn't Except the fact that it was one of the lights And I didn't have a light at that time So I almost bought that I did buy my Now I can't remember which letter is attached to it My pink one Because it was pink I do feel a little And I wanted to be different than what people expect
1792580	1793700	Mine are very generic.
1793740	1796361	My DS fat is gray and my DS light is black.
1796481	1798102	It's not my DS, my old SP.
1798342	1799582	No, not the SP, the one before that.
1799682	1802543	But I feel a little ridiculous having both of them at this point.
1802583	1805083	I'm like, I just need to sell one of these, but who'd buy it?
1805944	1806564	Do what we do.
1807384	1808044	Get another room.
1809645	1810685	I don't have another room.
1810705	1811265	I just moved.
1811305	1812105	I had to downsize.
1812125	1813606	I don't have as much room as I had before.
1814026	1815426	I got boxes everywhere still.
1816186	1817147	I need to get rid of things.
1817847	1818927	Take my DS to the dump.
1820168	1821808	All right, let's move on with some more news.
1822446	1826067	Okay, so some other interesting stuff that came out of the Media Summit.
1826428	1835091	Nintendo will be publishing Dragon Quest IX in North America, which is kind of weird if you think about it because Square Enix is over here.
1835171	1836432	Why aren't they publishing the game?
1837672	1854214	whatever it's coming out over here sometime in the summer and you know with Nintendo being the one that's publishing the game hopefully there'll be a better marketing campaign behind it so maybe that's good and because people buy blindly whatever Nintendo puts out so that's always good
1856235	1881525	another game scheduled for May coming to the DS would be Picross 3D and kind of a cool looking game and of course you know Picross is kind of a puzzle game where you make a picture well now it's going to be in three dimensions as well and you'll break apart cubes to reveal different little cube animals and objects and stuff so that's kind of neat um
1882725	1883285	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1905811	1906992	Not in America, no, that's true.
1907733	1909194	And it looks pretty cool.
1909234	1911615	Kind of reminded me of some Panzer Dragon stuff on there.
1913977	1915158	And then, of course, WiiWare.
1916319	1923845	Right around the corner, actually, Cave Story will be making its way out on WiiWare March 22nd with slightly upgraded graphics.
1924585	1926627	And it looks kind of neat.
1926747	1934613	Also, there's going to be some download content as well being available, including a new Boss Rush and Sanctuary Time Attack mode.
1935253	1937074	That will be available to download.
1940175	1940355	Huh.
1940915	1942615	Oh, I guess I take that back.
1943456	1944096	I misread that.
1944736	1947197	It was originally announced as download content, but now it's being included.
1948037	1948918	So, you get it for free.
1950718	1952439	Well, extra stuff for free is always good.
1952839	1953199	Definitely.
1956060	1959041	Any news that particularly got you excited at the Nintendo conference?
1959061	1960501	Now we've kind of touched on most of the stuff.
1961922	1962002	Um...
1964549	1974634	There was some other interesting stuff, like regarding Monster Hunter Tri, or I guess they're calling it Monster Hunter Tri or whatever.
1976295	1977876	But we'll talk a little bit more about that later.
1978136	1979237	Gotcha.
1980577	1987421	I was very interested to see that both Mario Galaxy and Metroid Other M are coming out in the second quarter, which...
1988993	1989574	Thank you for watching!
1999719	2000540	New Zelda, OMG!
2025140	2029705	and last year's E3 they came out within five minutes they were on New Super Mario Bros.
2029745	2032548	Wii and they're like hey it's a New Super Mario Bros.
2032588	2039236	game that looks and kind of plays like the old school one and this is what gamers want da da da and guess what it's out this holiday woohoo
2039676	2041417	And that was one of the big things they showed on the floor.
2041797	2050119	You know, I'm thinking there could be another, like, gotcha this year from Nintendo, except I worry it might be the Zelda game that's already kind of leaked out.
2050259	2053740	I'm guessing it's going to be like a Pikmin 3, probably the new Zelda game.
2054340	2061283	Wii Relax, which will be retarded, but it'll probably come out around October-ish, I think around the same time as Wii Fit Plus did this year.
2061323	2063223	And I think they'll probably treat it as... Oh, the Vitality?
2063563	2067384	Yeah, I think they'll probably treat it as much, you know, like the Wii Fit Plus.
2067805	2068765	Not a lot of... I mean...
2069605	2074407	Probably not going to do as well as we fit in general.
2075748	2080270	I just don't see the need for that little vitality sensor, but whatever.
2080290	2087734	What would be really cool though is to do a new Zelda game, but new Super Mario Bros.
2087774	2092216	style where it's old school Zelda, but four player and teaming up.
2092236	2093077	So the four swords.
2093597	2094317	Something like that, yeah.
2094837	2096018	I want a lethargy sensor.
2097321	2099743	How about a Wii Vitality Sensor that shocks you?
2100584	2101224	You're not moving!
2101324	2102465	Clear!
2103686	2108830	Or just something like when you screw up in the game, it gives you a little bite with electricity or something.
2108870	2109170	I don't know.
2110151	2110551	Could be fun.
2110571	2112953	Maybe a new WarioWare game.
2113113	2117336	Or the fanboy in me would love to see an F-Zero game come out of nowhere.
2117356	2121359	I'm not going to hold my breath though, but that would be the whoa crap game.
2121580	2123481	I'm still holding out for an Excite Truck
2124925	2127809	A real Excite Truck 2, not this Excite Bots bullshit.
2129872	2130332	Who knows?
2130393	2131154	Anything's possible.
2131721	2133442	All right, well, let's move on to some other platforms.
2133502	2143168	Obviously, a big game going on right now is Heavy Rain on the PlayStation 3, which sadly I have not gotten my hands on yet amongst all my real-life stuff going on, but I do want to play it at some point.
2143228	2152334	Although I heard, and this is kind of like breaking news as we're taping live on this Sunday, I heard something about PlayStation Network is down right now, I guess, and if you want to play Heavy Rain, you can't.
2152995	2154496	Like, I don't know how that works.
2154716	2157197	Does the game talk to the servers somehow?
2157278	2158178	Like, you have to be online?
2158198	2158839	I don't see how it could.
2159699	2165267	I don't see how it could because, you know, what if you don't have an internet connection and you can't play the game?
2167474	2191702	I don't know, apparently something was going on I guess there's some game crashing errors going on on the PSN and it has something to do with the dates reverting and now some of the data is corrupting or something and yeah, the issues are preventing folks from launching games like Heavy Rain so it sounds like the date or something might have got screwed up and now it's messing everyone up I wonder how that works Yikes Hopefully that's fixed soon
2193183	2196084	Heavy Rain was banned in another country this week.
2196445	2197585	United Arab Emirates.
2198006	2199647	You will not be able to play Heavy Rain.
2199707	2200727	It's an official ban there.
2201628	2210753	So if you are in the Middle East and you want to play this game, you're going to have to import it or something because the game was banned by the country's National Media Council.
2211133	2215376	Of course, Sony has come out and said, you know, the game is an 18 plus game.
2215416	2220419	It is strong content, but they didn't really respond to this particular ban.
2221039	2229045	So I have a feeling they might just cut their losses since, unfortunately, for anybody listening who might be in the UAE, it's not one of Sony's biggest markets.
2229205	2232027	So they might just be cutting their losses and hoping you guys will import it.
2232147	2232527	I don't know.
2233628	2236349	But it wasn't banned because of the bugs.
2236409	2239171	Apparently, there's some bugs going on in Heavy Rain.
2239211	2240892	It has to do with just some technical things.
2241253	2242694	Some audio is out of sync.
2243714	2245095	The game is freezing up.
2245275	2248337	There are some auto-saves that turn out they can't load.
2248598	2250359	And for some reason, everybody's speaking French.
2251459	2253040	I'm just kidding about the last one, sort of.
2253060	2259961	But the rest is all... Well, you've heard about how Heavy Rain was made in France and was developed by a French studio.
2260282	2265163	So they have all these French voice actors, but they're doing English and apparently the accent is really noticeable.
2265183	2266823	Really noticeable.
2266883	2275966	The PlayStation Network actually got hacked because on their website there is a directory called Dear PlayStation that says get Flash and or enable JavaScript and stop wasting my time.
2278274	2278934	Interesting.
2281195	2281555	Yikes.
2281635	2284597	So PSN might be the victim of a hack going on right now.
2286297	2288278	So yeah, the game is locking up and so forth.
2288438	2294380	So I guess Sony has kind of posted in their forums about it saying that they are aware of some of the issues.
2294761	2302624	And if you're having a particular issue, you should go to the thread and post your information because this is the era of patching video games that are already broken.
2303664	2327977	isn't Sony the same service that's running a show right now about finding a video game tester I'm going to talk about this more in part B yes Sony might need some more video game testers right now so maybe you all win yeah maybe everybody needs to win that show and go test Heavy Rain I don't know I will talk more about the tester in part B I have a lot of thoughts on that so we'll get into that a little later on in the program but for now more gaming news from DarkSakura and then the release dates in a little bit
2329023	2330104	Oh, release dates.
2330364	2331125	I'm looking forward.
2332085	2335328	But instead of that, this is not something that anyone should be looking forward to.
2335388	2336689	It's pretty bad.
2338010	2345175	There are 12 game stores, as in a big retailer in the UK.
2345595	2351239	Actually, more than that, 43 are going to be closing down in the UK.
2351359	2354941	That means that 247 people are going to be laid off.
2356162	2361746	or, as the article says, will be redundant, which I think is a horrible term.
2363627	2367270	Also... Well, that's what they call it over there, though, redundancies, right?
2367290	2367490	I know.
2367510	2370132	I just think it's just a terrible word.
2371332	2372593	You know, hi, you're redundant.
2373254	2374635	Okay.
2375535	2378337	Whose fault is that for creating a redundant position?
2378357	2379438	Yeah.
2379898	2381699	The same guy who's probably laying me off.
2381719	2385902	Well, that's going to be a third of the stores out of a total of 682.
2385982	2396729	So it's including 12 game stores and 6 game station outlets and 25 Debenhams stores, the little concessions.
2397062	2398142	GameStop GameCrazy GameCrazy
2425032	2426253	Don't get me started on that, please.
2426273	2429796	I know, I'm sorry, but, you know, it's... A bunch of GameStops closed?
2429916	2436260	Wow, then there would be an adequate number of GameStops available, because right now there's way too many.
2436280	2439343	Yeah, they're totally cornering the market, which I think is disgusting.
2439483	2441184	Don't we have antitrust laws and stuff?
2441384	2442885	Yeah, we do, but Google's not listening.
2442905	2444427	I mean, GameStop's not listening.
2445067	2445728	Did I say Google?
2446148	2446728	Yeah, you said Google.
2446748	2447789	Yeah, well, Google's on the list, too.
2447809	2448570	Google's always listening.
2449847	2454309	Now, Google's just been on a decline in the past couple years.
2454389	2456631	Google's being sued for violation of antitrust.
2457011	2459872	Well, I'm a big Google fan, but I'm sorry.
2459972	2461313	Wave was what?
2461733	2463454	We don't need Google Mars.
2463674	2464295	And Buzz?
2464515	2465255	Did you know about that?
2465755	2466176	Google Mars?
2466316	2467056	Google Mars.
2467276	2468617	That's the maps on Mars, right?
2468637	2468837	Yes.
2468877	2469678	I think that's cool.
2470138	2471779	It's cool, but it doesn't look very good.
2471859	2475401	And why do we need to... Can't we just go to NASA's website or something?
2475901	2476081	I'm okay.
2476161	2477101	I'm okay with Google Mars.
2477442	2481544	You know, it's Earth in the style, but it's Mars in the style of Google Earth.
2481564	2481964	I'm okay with that.
2481984	2482904	What about Google Veronica Mars?
2482944	2483204	Buzz!
2484205	2485465	Google Veronica Mars would be cool.
2485966	2487486	Buzz was bad.
2488707	2490448	Buzz was a bad idea.
2490668	2491308	What was Buzz?
2491388	2491969	I didn't hear about that.
2491989	2505055	Buzz was their response to Twitter, but the problem was it automatically added the, like, 40 most common people you email to your Buzz friends list, and if somebody went to your public profile, they could see the 40 people you email the most.
2505715	2513982	So if one of them happens to be like an ex or, you know, a boss is emailing his secretary on a personal email, everybody can see that.
2514002	2514543	Or a porn finder.
2514903	2515403	Exactly.
2515563	2521568	I mean, whoever thought that was a good idea needs to be made redundant.
2522609	2523070	Honestly.
2523590	2526672	Well, if they were going to do something like that, they should have it as an option that you could select.
2526852	2528253	It's ridiculous.
2528373	2532775	Well, now they backtracked, but they botched the launch of that thing, and now nobody's going to trust it.
2532815	2537218	So they might as well just nuke, nuke Buzz, nuke Wave, and start again.
2537398	2537958	Google BuzzWave.
2537979	2540140	I am sick of the social networking, by the way.
2540360	2542441	It's like I was posting on my Facebook earlier.
2542881	2545323	I'm sick of social networking, yet I'm compelled to still do it.
2545843	2548347	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2562245	2563526	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2589523	2590523	That's just ridiculous.
2590563	2593384	And I'm just thinking like, okay, I get what they're trying to do.
2593884	2601126	Like here at OLR, we try to embrace all social networking when it comes out because we want to be where every gamer has a voice and we want people to interact with us.
2601926	2605487	And I get that Bizarre is trying to be on the cutting edge.
2605687	2607427	So for that, I say, okay, cool.
2607747	2611608	But there's the other part of me that goes, God, as if Twitter didn't have enough bullshit on it already.
2612148	2615471	Like, honestly, guys, I'm just straight up with this whole social networking thing.
2615491	2616271	And I've told people this.
2616811	2629280	If you post important news about your life on Facebook and are going to give me a pop quiz on it later or expect me to know that, like, you are getting engaged because the only place you said anything was Facebook, I'm sorry.
2629781	2630702	That doesn't fly with me.
2631122	2635405	Like, if you want me to know what's going on with you, text, email.
2635425	2637927	You know, I like to think those are kind of modern things.
2638067	2638667	Or call.
2638967	2640789	Pick up the phone, dial the numbers, and call.
2641485	2642165	You know what?
2642225	2643366	I have to read this list.
2643927	2646168	And it's a poster that was done by The Oatmeal.
2647449	2649290	The 10 things you need to stop tweeting about.
2650210	2650891	Have you seen that, Rob?
2651431	2651971	No, I have not.
2652452	2653552	One, what are you eating?
2653793	2655093	I had meatloaf for breakfast.
2655253	2655894	LOL, please, RT.
2657828	2673765	social media the conference or event that you're at Twitter itself well now wait a minute though because Twitter like we did the tweet thing from E3 and I think a lot of people like that because we post pictures on the floor that was reporting news this example is using it's like
2676154	2697253	So and so totally owned that last session on optimizing your Twitter background pic I get what you're saying You know what, there's a girl on my friends list And I love her to death I think she's amazing But she posts so many updates Whenever she's at like a concert for a former American Idol or something Like it just fills up my page And I can't see anybody else's list And I'm kind of just thinking like
2698374	2699534	Can you post a live journal?
2699775	2701435	Or somewhere where you can make long posts?
2701455	2705356	The other one on here is your workout, your kid, dog, cat, goat, or whatever else.
2705997	2708978	Speaking out of context, as in people who just say nonsense.
2709498	2711639	Daily booth photos, emotional breakthroughs.
2711659	2712859	What's a daily booth photo?
2713219	2715440	Like posting the daily picture of yourself.
2716491	2719275	Oh, like where it's the same picture of me every day, flexing and looking cute?
2719315	2719715	Yeah, okay.
2719796	2721958	Emotional breakthroughs in the number of followers you have.
2722439	2723540	Oh, yeah.
2724241	2727806	That's so tacky when somebody posts like, I have a thousand followers.
2728587	2729488	Well, I'll have to tell you.
2729528	2730229	Now you don't.
2730990	2731411	Now you have 999.
2731471	2731631	Click.
2732935	2735617	I have to tell you what hit me today.
2735697	2740579	And I actually use Twitter now for more of professional networking.
2741240	2743301	I follow a lot of other designers.
2743561	2745262	I follow people in the comic book industry.
2745402	2751485	And I actually get something out of... And yeah, it's not that I don't care about the people on Twitter.
2752286	2752786	You know what I mean?
2753366	2756248	It's just that I really don't need to know how big of a poop you took.
2758109	2761191	I'm sure your baby is cute, but I would rather have something meaningful.
2762153	2788639	I honestly I feel like the biggest hypocrite when it comes to Twitter because most of the stuff I tweet these days have to do with video games and I kind of use it like for OLR related things and to keep tabs on the OLR fans but I don't like reading that stuff like when I look at my fans list and it's like a bunch of other podcasters promoting their shows I'm like yeah okay I know you have a show I get it but as in here I am tweeting hey listen to OLR tonight you know well it's just Twitter makes me feel dirty
2789119	2794048	Well, that's why I say, you know, we have problems with it, yet we feel compelled to use it, right?
2794569	2797554	Because it is now a part of our culture.
2798960	2802684	If you think about it, it's really a great... Which is why it's not cool anymore.
2804325	2809250	In Facebook, I have a little bit more love for because I use that as my mini blog.
2809870	2815555	That's actually, I go back and check on it because I usually just put my to-do list up there, like what do I need to get done today and refer back to it.
2815976	2824284	But I've actually not even been, you know, I'm actually making a conscious effort not to use either of them so much and actually keep a notebook with me and use my live journal and my blog.
2824904	2832667	Well, the thing that freaks me out is that CNN uses Twitter as a real source now, and that kind of weirds me out a little bit.
2832707	2835528	Like when Boner died this week, right?
2835648	2838729	The celebrity from... He was Boner on Growing Pain.
2838789	2839609	Chekhov's kid.
2839909	2840890	Yeah, oh yeah, Chekhov's kid.
2841890	2845231	You know, unfortunately, very tragic, sad, you know, what have you.
2845431	2849733	But CNN went to Twitter to see what all the other celebrities...
2850433	2851574	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2870390	2871872	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2892682	2892982	I know.
2893823	2894863	Well, this is my thought.
2895003	2896624	I can use Google and Twitter.
2896864	2903007	When they're doing editorials and want to get viewer feedback, that's a good thing.
2903067	2905108	It's the same reason why we have the chat room.
2905789	2911251	When we talk about an actual story and we want to see what people think about it, I think look at it as that equivalent.
2912212	2914613	But it's a fine line.
2914653	2916154	It's a really fine line.
2917394	2919916	You know, that's why I think there's legitimate uses for it.
2920016	2923338	I think, you know, a lot of people honestly are using it to validate themselves.
2924458	2929802	Whereas, you know, if you want to share something important with people, it's a good way to do it.
2929922	2935185	If you want to see what other people are doing in your industry, it's a good thing to find out other people that are in your industry.
2935605	2940708	But I'm really just getting like so tired of the, oh, I had to poop today.
2942149	2946212	Yeah, nobody's going to retweet you and then say, I'm so glad your colon is working properly.
2947093	2948414	Some people do reply to that.
2949915	2950776	Don't get me started.
2951497	2958862	And yeah, I post really inane stuff on there too, but I actually just detached my loud Twitter feed from my live journal.
2960844	2964046	Yay!
2964126	2967369	That's the thing I hate most about Twitter is that it's invading live journal.
2967409	2967709	Yay!
2967909	2969551	Gold star for Jamie, I'm so happy.
2970271	2975873	Over the last few weeks, I would just go back and check my loud Twitter feed and I posted one thing.
2977233	2977594	Why?
2979274	2980875	I just now do it to keep up with other people.
2981375	2989938	Or if I have something to announce that's important, like, come to my birthday party, or I'm going to be going to LA, I would like to meet up with my friends there.
2990058	2990698	That type of thing.
2991558	2996780	That's a little bit more reasonable instead of, oh, I had some Weetabix for breakfast.
2998211	2998532	I don't know.
2998952	3008137	I know we're on this big tangent with social networking, but we're in a weird place right now where it's kind of like the honeymoon phase is over with the Twitter and the Facebook and now it's like, okay, I'm over it.
3010362	3016166	If you have some thoughts, why not email them to us, mailbag at orangelandradio.com, or we'll probably get some phone calls on it later in the show.
3016666	3021490	For now, though, we want to get to the classic game of the week, but not before we do release dates and a couple more news stories.
3021570	3024652	So let's travel around the world and see what's coming out in the various countries.
3024732	3024972	Loki.
3025272	3027714	Yes, this week there's actually some pretty good stuff coming out.
3028575	3032417	Sins of a Solar Empire, Trinity, actually, coming out this week as well.
3033538	3038762	Dante's Inferno making its way out on PSP was a little delayed from the other games by almost a month.
3039582	3049008	Alice in Wonderland, they have that coming out in DS and on the Wii, the Wii version being more like the movie, the DS version being more like Beetlejuice the cartoon.
3050189	3051710	At least that's what it looks like in the picture.
3053791	3058814	Lunar Silver Star Harmony Limited Edition coming out on PSP.
3060215	3086465	DECA Sports on the DS this week SpongeBob's Boating Bash coming out on the Nintendo DS and on the Wii kind of a demolition derby type of game MLB 2K10 coming out on PlayStation 2, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and PSP Also coming out from Sony, MLB 10 The Show, which is on all Sony platforms, PS2, PS3, and PSP
3089591	3094853	Battle of Giants, Mutant Insects, Battlefield Bad Company 2, Silent Hunter 5, Battle of the Atlantic,
3109364	3122591	Supreme Commander 2 coming out from Square Enix on PC as well and Lips Party Classics coming out on Xbox 360 and that is it.
3122831	3127493	I saw a new commercial for Lips this week that I guess uses Lily Allen sort of as the centerpiece of it.
3128374	3128494	Eh.
3129655	3130435	I wasn't that impressed.
3132762	3134643	I don't know, I guess maybe I'm just more of a SingStar fan.
3134683	3136803	I'm surprised anybody buys Lips, to be honest.
3137144	3143906	Well, I buy SingStar, I mean... Yeah, but I understand SingStar because there's an actual following for that, but Lips is not so much.
3144326	3145907	It's like they're trying, they keep putting games out.
3145927	3148508	Well, I think Lips was kind of put out as a response to SingStar.
3148988	3152889	You know, if Lips had come first, I probably would have been on the Lips bandwagon.
3152909	3155310	It's just SingStar seems to be easier to use, I guess.
3155390	3157951	Well, SingStar also has the real... Well, I guess Lips does too.
3158011	3158331	I don't know.
3158551	3161692	I know SingStar just has all the real videos integrated.
3161892	3163052	It's a really great party game.
3163232	3163752	It does too.
3164012	3171534	But the thing I thought with Lips was it was supposed to be able to integrate any music that you had and kind of turn it into a karaoke version.
3172555	3173175	I believe it does.
3173235	3174055	It's just kind of wonky.
3174375	3176996	It's not the greatest implementation.
3177497	3178777	It's basically using one of those.
3179137	3184080	You can use a filter in Adobe Audition to take out vocals too, but it's a little hit and miss.
3184160	3189222	There's even some MP3 plugins that do that for Winamp, but it's a little hit and miss because it's just looking.
3189843	3196726	I don't know how the science of it works, but it looks at a certain component of the track of the song and kind of removes it, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.
3198481	3218027	Anyhow, moving on to the Xbox 360 in Japan and looking at Japanese release dates Bioshock 2 comes out this week on March 4th as well as Nobunaga no Yabutendo comes out and I believe that was on the PS3 a couple weeks ago because I seem to remember talking about that game before but yeah, localized version of Bioshock 2 also on the 360 this week in Japan
3218767	3219828	Moving on to the PlayStation 3.
3221169	3224991	No, there's Nobunaga no Yabutendo again, so maybe it was pushed back a little, I don't know.
3225351	3229333	But there it is on the PlayStation 3, also Bioshock 2 on the PlayStation 3 as well.
3230254	3231794	Maybe this is actually, you know what this is?
3232215	3232975	No, this is different.
3232995	3236597	This is not the Dynasty Warriors, this actually looks like Nobunaga's Ambition.
3236637	3238878	This looks like a next-gen version of it.
3238918	3245082	You know, I can't read the Japanese, but just looking at the interface, it looks like they're picking the different city layouts and so forth.
3245482	3252109	So if you know the Nobunaga Ambition series of games, I don't know how to explain it in a nutshell.
3252209	3259356	It's basically an RTS-ish kind of game that's about Japanese feudalism, I guess is the easiest way for me to sum it up.
3259376	3260697	It's a feudal Japan sim.
3261057	3265622	I liked the old school one on the NES, but boy that game's evolved quickly over time.
3265642	3267604	I had one on PlayStation 2 a few years back.
3268911	3270852	That was the last one I remembered that came out over here.
3271133	3271853	There's a new one coming out.
3272354	3274795	On the Nintendo Wii, nothing this week, believe it or not.
3274835	3276477	But next week, Taiko no Tatsujin.
3276497	3278558	I know our music game fans might be familiar with that one.
3278878	3281160	Taiko no Tatsujin makes its way to the Wii next week.
3281220	3282361	That's March 11th, not this week.
3282381	3283161	Is that another one?
3283222	3283742	Like a sequel?
3283782	3285283	Because I thought they had one over there already.
3285483	3290127	I thought they had one there already too, but this must be... Is this the one with the inflatable drum?
3290147	3291368	I believe it is.
3291928	3293929	Or this could also be a price reduction.
3294971	3300411	or it could be the game because yeah they're only I think this is maybe the game by itself without the drum
3302051	3303132	is probably what it is.
3305614	3307796	On the PlayStation 2 this week, nothing.
3307916	3308536	Again, nothing.
3309137	3313961	On the Nintendo DS, though, a lot of Dragon Quest games are going into the Ultimate Hits collection.
3313981	3322108	That would be 4, 9, and 5 all get price reductions for Squeenix, as well as Final Fantasy 4.
3322188	3323949	So it's a big week for price reductions.
3324770	3328133	Otherwise, there is Bomberman, Touchland...
3328513	3331516	Star Bomber No Miracle World gets a price reduction as well.
3332096	3337081	And probably a big, big release this week in Japan, which is why everything else is kind of limited this week.
3337441	3340705	Pokemon Ranger, Hikari no Kiseki comes out this week.
3341826	3342907	This is...
3344542	3345543	This is different.
3345563	3348966	This is not like the gold and silver in those games.
3348986	3351869	I think that's what that means.
3351889	3353010	Here's a little description here.
3353530	3357313	The Pokemon nappers are catching Pokemon and involving them in shady activities.
3358214	3360156	There are more than 300... Shut up.
3360456	3362817	There are more than 300 species of Pokemons.
3363137	3363677	Pokeporn.
3364317	3366318	Most of them you've seen in HeartGold and Silver.
3366718	3369519	And then you tame them and you can get them to join you in battle.
3369559	3373520	But it's not, like I'm just looking at the screenshots, it's not the same type of game as the other games.
3373540	3376461	This looks a little more like action-y, actually, for some reason.
3377622	3378502	Like a tactics game?
3379182	3381263	No, like, it looks like it's almost like mini-games.
3381303	3385104	Like, this one looks like, see how it's kind of like first-person flight type of game there?
3385284	3385484	Yeah.
3385564	3387525	And then this one looks like some type of running.
3388065	3390466	This one looks like they're drawing on the DS screen.
3391506	3394967	It looks like it's almost like a mix of mini-games and Pokemon or something.
3396148	3396688	So, there you go.
3399061	3404622	Lastly on the PSP, .hack slash link comes out on the PSP.
3404642	3407263	That's another big release, so check that out.
3407503	3412243	If you're a fan of the .hack series, the PSP gets a new .hack game this week.
3412603	3415664	They call it the grand finale you've all been waiting for.
3417504	3417924	Good luck.
3418965	3420385	Let's move to the UK, DarkSakura.
3421525	3422045	I'd like to.
3423505	3424066	Can we move there?
3425626	3426746	No, I can't afford it.
3427495	3452154	Okay, well on the 3rd of March we have Toy Soldiers, on the 5th we have Alice in Wonderland, and then Assassin's Creed 2 for PC, Battlefield Bad Company 2, BlazBlue Calamity Trigger, Dementium 2 on the DS, Picross 3D, Silent Hunter 5 by Ubisoft, and Supreme Hunter 2, and Sushi Go Round for the DS and the Wii.
3454456	3455236	Mmm, sushi.
3456097	3456718	Yay, sushi.
3458900	3463047	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys and then we're going to get into the classic game of the week.
3463087	3464530	And I'll just give you a little hint.
3464870	3466793	I'm not going to give away what DarkSakura's picked.
3466813	3468416	I'm just going to say it's really old.
3470279	3471020	But that's not a bad thing.
3472998	3473178	Huh.
3474679	3478603	So apparently Activision is being sued for false patent marketing.
3479283	3490432	And what that is, is basically that Activision is filing patents for its products that are beyond the scope of what it's producing.
3491033	3499279	For example, there's patent 753, which is basically a DDR pad, which would...
3500260	3500300	C1-6
3520801	3525926	And this is the group behind us, the patent compliance group.
3526226	3529769	They're seeking, and this is almost to the point where it's retarded.
3530190	3533372	They're seeking $500 for each Activision violation.
3533392	3533372	$500.
3534393	3534573	Really?
3534593	3534693	Yeah.
3539198	3545907	So, um, but apparently, um, they're also, you know, targeting other companies as well.
3546588	3548330	Um, just Activision happens to be one of those.
3548971	3553637	And according to, uh, Mark, looks like, uh, Mathenitus, uh, uh,
3554578	3561702	The statute in question is one that actually penalizes false marketing that a product is patented or patent pending.
3561762	3567505	The idea that those false markings might deter someone from trying to create something new in that area.
3568325	3570847	So basically, hey look, we have a...
3571747	3599890	Patent for a DDR controller You can't make any dance games It's like they're calling dibs on everything Dibs on this, dibs on this And then they don't do anything with it And we're going to get into another story a little later on tonight About something that they're like Nope, nope, can't have it, it's ours And they're not going to do anything with it As much as a silly lawsuit as this sounds I'm glad someone's calling them on it Because now Activision is going to have to respond to this Has Activision made a response to this?
3601239	3610826	Um, they haven't made a response yet, but at the same time, I don't see how they can, you know, patent a DDR pad when a DDR pad's already been made.
3611286	3611766	You know what I mean?
3611806	3615088	It's like, you can't patent something that already exists.
3615429	3620452	You can't say, hey look, I invented the rock, now you all owe me money because you have rocks.
3621533	3649294	well maybe they changed a couple little things well that's how it works patent law in this country is really weird really weird they change one or two things and claim it that they invented the genre we know how that works we'll see what comes forth of that I'm really looking forward to what Activision has to say about that remember when Activision was like the best game company in the world because they made games like Pitfall and Kaboom and Keystone Capers
3649684	3663404	And then Bobby Kotick came along His days are numbered, I'm telling you His days are numbered because he looks Just lately in the past couple years He's come out and looked like a buffoon He's douchey mcdouche Nobody likes their CEO to be a douche
3664659	3666960	Hey, how about something for free?
3667180	3667960	Free games.
3668000	3669320	Now, this is the way to do business.
3669501	3670801	Activision, take notes.
3671341	3671981	Free games.
3672121	3674182	Actually, I'll tell you even better than that, DarkSakura.
3674302	3675202	Free Peggle.
3675722	3676183	That's right.
3676303	3678063	Free Peggle.
3678123	3684805	There is a promotion going on right now where you can get Peggle Nights for yourself or a loved one, family member, or even an enemy if you want.
3684845	3685245	I don't care.
3685766	3689647	All you have to do, you sign up for PopCap's newsletter by going to PopCap.com.
3691228	3712209	by the way of course that means they're going to spam your email with all the newsletters but hey I don't know about you I have an email just set up for spam so to sign up for different websites bug me not so yeah there you go if you want there's also websites too with disposable email addresses that'll last for about 10 minutes enough time for them to send you back your confirmation code and then poof it's gone nice
3713988	3717272	I always liked the idea of setting up my own domain.
3717312	3718172	I had a friend that did this.
3718192	3720835	He had his own domain that he set up for email addresses.
3721256	3729104	And what he would do is when he would sign up for websites, he would create a new email account on his domain that was like, you know, whatever his name was.
3729124	3734890	We'll say John dot and then whatever the name of the site was that he was signing up for.
3735310	3735570	DarkSakura.com
3753762	3761207	Question from our chat room, Kossin, and I apologize if I'm saying that wrong, but Kossin says, what's the disposable email site called?
3761688	3764249	I don't remember, but I saw it in 2600 Magazine a while back.
3764850	3771354	Apparently, there's a few of them, because Gold Anthro follows up with Dispostable.com, and Robocoon says Meltmail.com.
3771554	3773916	Dispostable, I think, is the one I was thinking of.
3774036	3777218	And Toagak just simply says there are lots of them, so there's a few of them out there.
3778419	3780581	Wherever they can stick a banner ad, that's what they're going to do.
3781241	3785082	Alright, we're going to get into a segment here on the show that we love to do every week.
3785142	3786642	It's the Classic Game of the Week.
3789243	3803026	And during the Classic Game of the Week, we encourage DarkSakura to dive into the vault of classic gaming and find a game that she says, you know what, kids and adults too, you should be playing this game this week because it's a classic game.
3803346	3805086	And if you're not playing this, you're a buffoon.
3805606	3807646	Yeah, a butt-foon.
3807907	3810127	So what should the non-buffoons be playing this week?
3810546	3811647	The game is Venture.
3812767	3813488	It's from 1981.
3813668	3816069	Wow, that's old.
3816609	3816869	Yeah.
3816909	3818070	That's older than most of our listeners.
3818090	3820411	I was five when this game came out.
3820511	3825093	So since this is such an old game, there's not a lot of music, but let's play some... There's actually plenty of music in this one.
3825794	3827234	With some ambient noises and stuff?
3827275	3827995	No, it's a lot of music.
3828015	3828435	Is there actual music?
3828455	3828935	Just listen.
3828955	3829035	Oh.
3834874	3841739	The one posted here is actually the ClicoVision version specifically because I played a crap ton of this on ClicoVision.
3844662	3848485	But the game is where you're this little guy named Winky who looks like kind of a sperm.
3848765	3851848	I mean, kind of like a... Yeah, whatever.
3852845	3854566	This little blob with a bow and arrow.
3855007	3857709	And he walks around this hall with these big things.
3857849	3861093	I used to call them boogers when I was playing this as a kid.
3863495	3865697	But they're just these tentacled hall monsters.
3867058	3867939	You can't kill them.
3867979	3868940	You can't stop them.
3869140	3871182	They're just completely invulnerable.
3872283	3872383	And...
3874844	3885938	With that, you actually have to go into these four or five rooms per area, and then get the treasure that's in each room while you're shooting and avoiding the little creatures inside them, and each one has their own theme.
3888401	3893788	If you touch one of the monsters, it's called, you're getting carrioned.
3895458	3896879	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3923636	3925517	and you've got different types of dungeons.
3925537	3928218	You cannot touch a corpse because they're smelly.
3928258	3929118	You'll get carrioned.
3930379	3934060	In level one, you've got the wall room, the serpent room, the skeleton room, the goblin room.
3934760	3938421	In level two, you have the two-headed room, the dragon room, the spider room, the troll room.
3938441	3939962	I can tell you the dragon room was pain in the ass.
3940682	3943723	Level three, you have the genie room, the demon room, the cyclops room, and the bat room.
3946969	3974743	but I freaking love this game this is kind of weird because I noticed especially for being such an old game like you have this screen that's like zoomed out showing all the different rooms and then you kind of like go into one room that's the dragon room by the way pain in the ass but now this is one of those games keep in mind I had a ClicoVision for a long time like I remember MTV coming out and me having a ClicoVision
3976454	3980916	I remember those in a span of, you know, when I lived in the same house.
3980936	3981656	I'll put it that way.
3987379	3989760	My mother used to play a lot of this.
3990120	3992001	Actually, my mom's favorite game was Space Fury.
3992061	3992661	Do you remember that?
3993581	3994762	No, because I didn't have a click of it.
3994822	3997323	Space Fury was kind of like an Asteroids kind of game.
4000212	4003133	This is the type of stuff that I bet is coming to Microsoft's game room.
4003153	4010876	When they talk about like a thousand classic games, you're going to see somebody digging into the back catalog of a lot of the old systems like ColecoVision and Atari.
4010936	4012536	I could probably make this in Flash now.
4013436	4016457	I mean, seriously, I probably know enough Flash now to make this game.
4017418	4018538	I'm sure there's clones out there.
4019058	4024620	Yeah, but honestly, this was seriously one of my favorite games when I was a little kid.
4025800	4027822	And I love the little dinky music.
4027842	4030064	I'd go around humming this one to myself when I was a kid.
4031285	4034688	I mean, you know, the games that I had at the time, I had like Mousetrap and Carnival.
4036250	4037791	But this one got tons of play.
4038011	4039573	This one and Turbo.
4040714	4040914	But...
4043360	4046922	And it actually had pretty good music for when it came out.
4046963	4048083	For 81, yeah.
4049084	4052326	So there you go, your classic video game of the week, Venture.
4052446	4056629	It was an arcade game too, but I guess DarkSakura was really referencing the ColecoVision one.
4056949	4058430	Was the arcade version really different?
4058911	4059411	No, not really.
4060652	4062353	The ColecoVision one I think came out in...
4066495	4067735	82?
4066515	4067735	Here's some from the arcade version.
4067755	4069536	I just noticed this related little video here.
4069576	4071356	I just kind of want to take a peek and see how it's different.
4071756	4073416	Oh yeah, it's very similar looking.
4073457	4075197	Almost like it's done on the same hardware or something.
4075657	4077437	Except there's a little bit more animation.
4078097	4078357	Yeah.
4081858	4083979	Oh yeah, when you go in the rooms it zooms in.
4086239	4086619	Interesting.
4086639	4087919	But it had the same gameplay.
4088199	4088439	Yeah.
4090260	4090980	That's kind of interesting.
4091000	4091460	Oops, sorry.
4092406	4092647	All right.
4092947	4096956	But honestly, for me, it was all about... I mean, the rooms are all the same.
4096976	4099100	It's just they zoom in and out.
4100283	4102427	But this was totally like my game.
4103083	4104944	Venture Venture Venture Venture
4128838	4131760	My timeline from back then is not that great.
4131820	4132440	Let me check.
4132580	4134161	Yeah, look that up real quick because I'm curious.
4134761	4137343	Because there are some similarities of sorts between the two.
4137703	4140124	And I've seen comparisons to Berserk as well.
4140484	4145406	Yeah, the Hallmonster is actually sort of like the evil Otto from Berserk.
4145487	4147848	Which is the bouncing happy face, if anyone's actually played that.
4148528	4150209	Good stuff.
4151770	4152790	I can't find Adventure.
4153490	4153731	Oh well.
4154651	4156552	Maybe actually spelling it right would be nice.
4157330	4157650	DarkSakura.com
4175973	4183465	All right, well, we're going to take a quick break here at Orange Lounge Radio, but fear not, we'll be back with more in tonight's Part B. So stick around, folks.
4183926	4187311	We'll be right back in just a minute with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4189306	4196271	And for those of you guys listening live tonight, we're going to take a quick music break here in studio and then we'll come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4196592	4201896	We're just going to do some potpourri here of some various, I think we'll do some Bomani songs tonight.
4201936	4202236	Why not?
4203037	4207000	We'll be right back in just a moment here live at All Games Radio with Part B of Orange Lounge Radio.
4207020	4209522	This is a chance for you to get up and stretch and all that good stuff.
4210322	4210943	We'll see you in a minute.
4216707	4219148	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4241380	4264589	But we played a remix by Mr. T Not the I pity the foo kind from the A-Team But Mr. T that did Bomani remixes back in the day From Poppin' Music 10 He did a remix of Goonies Are Good Enough From Goonies 2 Which was also in the movie, the Cyndi Lauper song Now I can play a clip So let me play a quick little clip For the benefit of the podcast listeners
4273616	4274617	F the Haters
4298103	4299684	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network
4323153	4328519	It's kind of like an experimental thing because this is television essentially that was made for the PlayStation Network.
4328980	4335568	So it's a reality show and I know we've reported on this on the show before so I think most of our listeners are already aware.
4335868	4341294	It's this reality show where the prize is to become a game tester for Sony Computer Entertainment.
4341334	4342155	That is the prize.
4343076	4348343	And, but one thing they also don't say very well, also a $5,000 signing bonus.
4348724	4350766	So there is a cash prize that goes with it as well.
4351267	4353910	So there is at least just that.
4353930	4355593	You'll need it to offset the wages.
4356874	4358416	Well, I checked out the show.
4358496	4360579	Now, if you guys don't already know, I am...
4361580	4390356	Unapologetically a fan of reality game shows I don't necessarily mean all reality TV But I loved Survivor back in the day I wanted to apply for Survivor actually way back in the day But I didn't have a passport or something So I didn't do it I remember when they were casting for the first season of Survivor But I just love old game shows And I like the whole idea of a reality game show I've done fan games online I even like Project Runway And my new favorite reality game show is RuPaul's Drag Race It's the most amazing show on television right now
4390956	4391557	Thanks for watching!
4410709	4414612	But of course, obviously, hearing about the tester, I'm a little bit apprehensive about this.
4414632	4416733	But I'm like, okay, I'm a fan of reality shows.
4416853	4417754	I'm a fan of video games.
4418194	4420355	I need to check this show out and give it a fair shot.
4420735	4422136	So I downloaded the show.
4422256	4424038	It's about a 22-minute show.
4424098	4426739	It's suitable for a 30-minute broadcast, basically with commercial breaks.
4427300	4431662	And I watched it, and it's not that bad.
4433183	4434504	Are you surprised to hear me say that?
4435044	4435205	Nope.
4435445	4435665	Nope.
4436189	4438250	It's not terrible.
4439611	4441433	It's a ridiculous concept.
4441833	4454962	I mean, I'm not going to get past the fact that we all know, if you've kind of had a friend that works in the gaming industry, we all know the prize at the end of the day is ridiculous, but at least they throw a $5,000 signing bonus into it, so at least there's that.
4456482	4457022	Thanks for watching!
4476676	4481584	The look of it was really good and it was put together okay.
4481624	4488955	The editing was really tight because it's only a 22 minute show so you don't really get a lot of time to know the people but the editing was competent.
4489196	4491299	The show was put together well enough
4492721	4505671	The biggest flaw about the show is that, again, the contest is so ridiculous to begin with that basically the whole elimination and everything that they did was over this one minor challenge that they did.
4505711	4513878	That the judges, who were two guys that worked for Sony and Hal Sparks, which I don't know why Hal Sparks is a judge and not the host.
4514358	4542354	But whatever, I realize they need to have some type of celebrity draw I actually like Hal Sparks, I think he's great on The Soup back in the day when he was doing that stuff And then the I Love the 90s and all those shows I think he's funny, and of course queer as folk So I think he's a good talent to have on there Although as a judge, I think he would have been a better host Because they have some no-name girl doing the hosting And she's a generic reality show host, whatever
4543359	4544440	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4566557	4567077	and DarkSakura.com.
4581824	4609843	but here's the other thing I want to say about this because I know a lot of people are saying like what the hell Rob you actually like the show I don't know if I go so far as to say like I like it I'm going to set a season pass on my TiVo I just think it was a competent show and quite honestly it's better than about 90% of what's on G4 television here's my problem is I the way I looked at it is when I heard that they're doing a reality show where people are going to get to play you know games and stuff like that you know that are you know first looks at certain games I saw that as
4610023	4613064	Hey look, it's a 22 minute long commercial for Sony Games.
4613825	4614545	No thanks.
4632153	4632674	What's that, Jamie?
4650808	4652490	Nothing, I was talking about Shermie.
4652730	4652830	Oh.
4653010	4654011	Shermie just crapped.
4654371	4654912	Oh, did she?
4655012	4656333	That was her review of the show.
4657854	4658134	Nice.
4659135	4661897	But yeah, I mean, they played it up okay.
4662138	4663639	I mean, I was expecting a lot worse.
4663839	4664860	The bar was very low.
4665160	4670124	But I got a show that I would watch if I was flipping through TVs with nothing to watch.
4670445	4672606	And I stop on G4 TV and the show's on.
4672927	4675429	It's better than most of the crap on that network right now.
4675816	4679617	That still just doesn't sound like enough to make me actually put any effort into watching TV.
4681078	4682418	I wouldn't recommend this show for you, Jamie.
4682438	4683158	I don't think you'd like it.
4685319	4690401	I watch three shows with any variety of regularity.
4691261	4693802	Supernatural, Doctor Who, and...
4696786	4698228	I love drag queens so much.
4698288	4698928	Me too.
4698948	4699108	What?
4699329	4699809	On Xbox Live.
4699969	4700029	Huh.
4714955	4718377	Now that they're going to have the Microsoft Game Room thing.
4718697	4718897	Yeah.
4719458	4721559	To bring back Starcade.
4721759	4722559	Seriously.
4722680	4730864	But, you know, you've got to think, though, this is, sure, this show is a little eh, but it could be setting the stage for something even greater in the future.
4730944	4735067	Like, you know, it's kind of interesting that, wow, Sony put all this together.
4735647	4740270	Who else might deliver their show exclusively on PlayStation Network or Xbox Live Arcade?
4740570	4742491	And, yeah, I'm all for Starcade coming back.
4742771	4744192	Or some type of old school game show.
4744372	4770129	Like 1 vs. 100, but Starcade where you play the games that they're playing during the show and stuff like that That was a great idea To answer Tigerclaw, I wasn't impressed enough with the first episode of V to give it any more thought And for the listeners that don't know what DarkSakura's talking about Tigerclaw said V next month, you gotta watch V So there you go Oh, Shermie took a duty in the hallway, that's no good
4772978	4799835	And that's what she thinks of the tester A shit with no effort I can't believe the cat just took a dump on the floor in the middle of the show Dump where dump should not be on the PlayStation Network Which cat, when forced to watch the tester, takes a crap first?
4803743	4808993	No, to explain, Shermie is an old lady.
4809755	4811778	She's up there now in cat ears.
4812420	4815065	So she just didn't make it to the litter box or what?
4816027	4816788	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4838408	4838849	No, no, no.
4839169	4844613	She will do it either when she decides to poop somewhere that is not her box.
4845254	4849037	She will either do it on one of the bathroom rugs right in front of the bathroom or on one of the kitchen rugs.
4849798	4853561	She does not do it so much on one of the kitchen rugs because I yelled at her.
4854742	4857084	She at least does it where it can be easily cleaned up.
4858064	4859325	I think she's making a statement.
4859385	4861707	I think she's like, Mom, you should quit your job and pay attention to me 24-7.
4863807	4864728	She cats it all the time.
4865048	4868470	All right, let's stop talking about poop and talk about game news.
4869410	4872732	She says this show is good for me to poop on.
4873892	4874473	Clearly.
4875173	4877114	How about some rapid fire news, Loki?
4877514	4877854	All right.
4878435	4881376	Well, there's actually this is kind of... Real quick, sorry.
4881396	4882197	Get your tweets in.
4882757	4888480	I don't think I mentioned it before in the show, but if you have some tweets for tonight's Twitter topics, get those in now, now, now.
4889188	4890128	This is kind of interesting.
4890208	4899852	Super Meat Boy is coming to Xbox Live Arcade, and actually before the WiiWare version, which I didn't even realize there was an Xbox Live Arcade version, and now it's coming out before.
4899872	4904734	It's scheduled to be coming out this summer, and that's pretty cool.
4904754	4911076	And for those who don't know, Super Meat Boy is a platform action game starring a little character that's made out of meat.
4911976	4915397	and you splat around the screen and that's all fun.
4916838	4936924	Then of course there's going to be a tie-in game with the new movie Kick-Ass that is coming to PlayStation 3 and the iPhone and of course this game kind of reminds me a little bit of The Watchmen The End is Nigh which I think did a little bit better on the PS3 probably because the Blu-ray was bundled with the game.
4937864	4938784	when it came out in retail.
4938864	4944226	But the PS3 game will have Facebook integration as well.
4945086	4947887	I don't know.
4948247	4950127	The game looks just okay.
4950627	4953328	It looks just like a beat-em-up action game, just like the Watchmen one.
4954809	4956629	The movie, though, on the other hand, is pretty awesome.
4956849	4963331	It's kind of what happens when kids decide to become superheroes, but they don't have superpowers.
4963531	4964311	They just fight crime.
4965956	4967583	and Scott Nicholas Cage acting weird.
4969521	4975105	and then on the PlayStation Network the version of Castle Crashers is getting a brand new edition.
4975966	4981170	Extreme Volleyball Action is coming to the PlayStation 3 version of Castle Crashers.
4983051	4997882	Apparently they're including a cooperative and competitive volleyball game with online or offline play and Magic Attacks apparently will be directly applied to your ball as well as there's going to be some leaderboards
4999143	5002865	Spiky Moves, and some other stuff.
5002905	5006127	And this is coming from the Behemoth Development Blog.
5008329	5012371	Sorry, Jamie's having the great Lysol race in the hallway right now.
5012831	5014072	It's a good thing I can't smell anything.
5014092	5015913	That's right, you're congested.
5015953	5016934	I can't smell a thing.
5016994	5018014	I was just being polite.
5018054	5020176	I didn't want to sit here and go, Jamie, your house smells like poop.
5020316	5021897	Well, no, I just smelled it.
5022837	5023578	Fucking Shermie.
5024278	5024838	She just needs a...
5026966	5030854	I was like, I don't know, maybe all this talk about the tester made Jamie crap her pants.
5031014	5032277	I don't want to be rude.
5032638	5035724	No, it sure makes shit in the hall.
5035764	5036686	At least go in the tub.
5040763	5042103	That was a reference to last week's show.
5042123	5042724	You see what I did there?
5044184	5044724	Sorry, Loki.
5044964	5046265	Do you have anything else you want to share?
5046925	5048145	That's it.
5048205	5049866	I got some quick stories for you guys.
5050246	5051526	Actually, I did check out this game.
5051546	5056007	I didn't mention it during my gaming week, but this is something I did check out this week, and that was Missile Command.
5056047	5059128	It's a brand new version of Missile Command from Atari.
5059368	5061969	It's free to play, and it's on the web, and it's like a co-op.
5062289	5065590	It's actually a multiplayer thing by developer OMGPOP.
5066121	5067862	Atari.com slash Missile Command It's free, can't complain about free
5090385	5092327	I'm not surprised 505 Games is the publisher I think
5117788	5119049	I'm sorry, yeah, they are the publisher.
5119129	5120270	Who's developing it?
5120330	5121130	Big Head Games.
5121831	5123211	They did Chime on the Xbox Live.
5124132	5125313	That was recent.
5125673	5128835	No word as to what the game is at all.
5128875	5130356	How would you make a game out of grease?
5130716	5131837	Like a karaoke game?
5132097	5132877	It's going to be awful.
5133037	5135739	It's just like, hey, look, we bought the rights to something.
5135799	5137160	Yay, let's make a game out of it.
5138441	5140722	Not them, but other companies.
5140762	5141943	They'll buy rights for...
5143504	5144545	Like stupid shit.
5144605	5146247	Like the smile.
5146407	5147869	You know like the smiley face shirts?
5148269	5148710	Smiley?
5148830	5149030	Yeah.
5149491	5151773	There's a company that bought the rights for that and made a game out of it.
5151893	5153335	No one remembers it because it sucked.
5153775	5156939	I remember Faceball 2000 that had the big smileys.
5157059	5158140	Have a nice day.
5159021	5160523	Exactly, but that game was actually kind of fun.
5161724	5162585	Or, for example...
5164908	5169956	The Jelly Belly, they have like a Jelly Belly game because they licensed that because the license was really cheap.
5169976	5170817	Jelly Bellys are yummy.
5171178	5173562	Or M&M's, they made some M&M games.
5173582	5176086	Oh yeah, there was like an M&M racing game that was pretty terrible, huh?
5177432	5182554	Well, yeah, Yo Noid was cool, but that was way back in the 80s when people knew what the hell the Noid was.
5182574	5183074	Make kids.
5184134	5185515	Isn't the Noid supposed to be making a comeback?
5186495	5187476	It was supposed to be.
5187996	5190316	Look, how about a computer game everybody wants to play?
5190336	5191877	There's tons and tons of people who want to play this.
5191917	5194398	StarCraft 2, and of course the beta's going on right now.
5194858	5195319	DarkSakura
5221084	5223146	Well, this is pretty happy stuff.
5223586	5229592	There are, for a pre-order bonus for Super Street Fighter 4, there's a classic costume pack.
5230392	5234556	And so they are for Blanka, Guile, Gen, Feilong, and Dhalsim.
5235917	5240961	For Feilong, he gets a kind of a Kato costume.
5242162	5243083	I love Feilong.
5243684	5246186	Blanka gets Dansgi costume.
5248187	5250429	And this goes back to Street Fighter Alpha 3.
5251289	5252890	Did you ever beat Street Fighter Alpha 3?
5252930	5255492	I don't think I ever played Street Fighter Alpha 3.
5255672	5258453	It was kind of during that period when I wasn't playing a lot of games heavy.
5258854	5262136	One of the endings, Dan and Blanka are just hanging out.
5263677	5265398	Dan can understand all of Blanka's grunts.
5266331	5268192	So he's like, I see you, my friend.
5268252	5269333	Let's go out and play.
5269553	5270474	Rolling and rolling.
5270494	5271954	And it has the two of them rolling across the screen.
5271974	5273515	That's where I get the rolling and rolling from.
5274316	5276777	So yeah, he's wearing Dansky.
5277758	5279079	Are they like gay lovers or something?
5279299	5280059	I don't think so.
5280419	5281120	They're just BFFs.
5281800	5282460	They're BFFs.
5282480	5283861	It's Jay and Silent Bob.
5285142	5287943	And then Gen has a shirtless... Heterosexual life partners.
5288163	5288383	Yeah.
5289403	5290224	Gen is shirtless.
5290784	5293805	Guile is wearing a ballistic vest.
5294105	5298107	He's just all kinds of, you know, hardcore ops guy.
5298707	5308731	And Dhalsim is wearing a, I guess, just more traditional dress for India.
5308751	5308831	Yeah.
5310111	5310551	There you go.
5310631	5311391	Very snazzy and lousy.
5311411	5322795	He looks like... Who was that fighter in Mike Tyson's Punch-Out where the little ruby in his turban would flash and that's how you knew he was about to throw a punch?
5323415	5325236	What was that guy's name in Mike Tyson's Punch-Out?
5325276	5325896	I don't remember.
5326356	5327796	That's what Dhalsim looks like right there.
5327917	5329357	I'm going to link the picture in the chat room.
5329977	5356009	Somebody in chat will yell it out There's a tiger or something Shaoran in chat by the way says bromance would be the term for what Dan and Blanca have going on there Now I have an image of Dan saying snooch to the nooch You know there's actually it's funny the term bromance there actually is a term called romantic friendship Have you ever heard of that?
5356770	5359311	I think I have yeah I thought that was funny
5360326	5362527	Dark Tetsuya says Great Tiger was the name of that fighter.
5363267	5363708	Sounds right.
5364068	5364648	I think he's right.
5366209	5370691	That's why I love having a live audience because when I don't know the answer to something I'll just go chat help and they do.
5370971	5371431	It's great.
5372272	5374993	And Actdefta is wondering if they're starting a bad bromance.
5377435	5377875	You know what?
5377935	5385322	I freaking have to listen to that song now after me really loathing Lady whatever.
5386584	5388886	You cannot resist the power of Lady Gaga.
5388906	5389727	She's amazing.
5389767	5391789	I don't really like any of her other stuff, by the way.
5392049	5394231	It's just that one I actually kind of like.
5394351	5394992	Nobody's perfect.
5395132	5395712	You'll come around.
5396013	5396893	I know.
5396953	5398395	She'll eventually become perfect like me.
5398993	5403915	Twitter topic time, www.twitter.com slash OLR.
5403995	5408916	Show us your tweets every week and we'll read some of our favorites here on the program.
5408936	5412937	Of course, we can't read everything, but there's some really good questions tonight, so I want to get to this.
5413958	5414558	Let's see.
5415118	5417579	Nutman wants to know if the podcast will be uploaded tomorrow.
5417619	5418339	Pretty please.
5418499	5418979	It should be.
5419459	5420840	There shouldn't be a delay at all this week.
5420880	5424281	Although I got to say, I had last week show up Monday night, but I should...
5424821	5429604	I've been getting pretty good this year about getting this show up within 24 hours, so I'm going to try and continue that trend.
5429785	5430325	Knock on wood.
5431306	5437130	Actdeft links us to a story that Harmonix might not actually be working on Rock Band 3 right now.
5437170	5439371	There may actually be something else going on right now.
5440332	5444255	I guess this is a news story he's linked us to from rockbandaid.com.
5447417	5448598	I guess, let's see, what's going on here?
5448638	5451320	There's a Twitter from some guy, I guess, at Harmonix.
5451680	5456783	Harmonix, the creators of the Rock Band video game, is planning on using one of my tracks for their demo projects.
5457003	5457303	Awesome.
5457363	5459665	Oh, no, this is some other guy.
5460145	5464328	And I guess Harmonix recently licensed hip-hop and dance songs, kind of putting it all together.
5464848	5470152	And so now maybe there might be a new frequency or amplitude game is kind of the rumor that's going on right now.
5470572	5491388	Which would make a lot of sense, you know, Frequency and Amplitude kind of came out when not a lot of people knew who Harmonix was And they were more experimental games, but they were great games And I think if they are gonna, you know, now that more people know what Rock Band is That they're gonna kind of come out with a, I don't know, what would they call a game around dance music and stuff That's in that Frequency, Amplitude vein, I don't know Frequency?
5492189	5492589	Frequency 2?
5493390	5494050	Frequitude?
5494671	5496292	Who knows Applency?
5496312	5496952	DJ Hero?
5497092	5497513	Oh wait, no
5498991	5499331	We'll see.
5499892	5503416	Salvax7 sends us a variety of tweets here around one subject.
5503436	5503996	Let me read these.
5504016	5506579	It's a little longer than 140 characters, but it's okay.
5506920	5507901	Because I like the question here.
5507941	5509122	Salvax7 on Twitter.
5509542	5511324	Hey guys, I have an interesting question for you.
5511705	5518192	Historically, which generation of gaming would you classify as the most contrib... It got cut off.
5518212	5520835	I'm assuming contributive to society's development.
5521315	5526898	Regarding to the social interaction, the fun element, escape from one's reality, and moral values.
5527378	5530340	I know it's complex, but if you could answer it, I would appreciate it.
5530440	5531200	Take care, guys.
5531241	5531881	Have a nice one.
5532561	5533162	What do you guys think?
5533482	5539345	What generation of gaming would classify as the most contributive to society's development?
5541892	5542532	That's a tough question.
5542552	5543233	Development of what?
5544013	5545393	Just the development of society.
5545754	5552957	As in, and he goes on to specify, as in the social interaction, the fun element, the escape from one's reality and moral values.
5553237	5553697	Pong.
5554857	5555978	All the way back to old school pong.
5555998	5556758	Where would we be?
5556858	5559299	I mean, where would the industry be if someone didn't invent pong?
5559339	5560520	The zeroth generation?
5561020	5561200	Yeah.
5562418	5564301	I'd say like the arcade age or something like that.
5564341	5576398	Maybe even like just the, not necessarily the 8-bit generation, but like, you know, even before that, probably the 4-bit generation, you know, the Atari, Coleco, Odyssey, that kind of stuff.
5576558	5578701	Well, I think in gaming it'd be the day that we got on the radio.
5580106	5580526	Nice answer.
5581247	5582748	I would have two answers for this question.
5582788	5585269	I would say I think it's the fourth generation of gaming.
5585629	5586950	The one that involved the NES.
5587390	5596295	When the Nintendo Entertainment System first came to America because it came out at a time when video games were pretty much declared dead and dying and nobody was interested in video games anymore.
5596696	5600818	You know, after the great video game crash of 84, 83, whatever you want to pay it as.
5601218	5603280	I'm sorry I'm not from your country
5618115	5637007	even people that don't do nerdy gaming podcasts every week or listen to them they know who Mario and Luigi are you know those characters I think it was really the first generation to create a character I don't think everybody on the street knows who Pitfall Harry or maybe some of the well maybe Pac-Man I mean that came from the generation before but I think I don't know
5637367	5641470	Something about really bringing it into the homes and so forth with these really memorable characters.
5641951	5644773	I think that was really the generation that defined current gaming.
5644793	5649377	Then again, Pac-Man did have a song written about him and Mario really didn't other than do the Mario.
5651178	5653901	But then my other answer to the question would be the current one.
5654321	5658546	The current generation of gaming, I think, is huge to society because for a variety of reasons.
5658986	5670578	A, the Wii has... As much as we love to hate on it for what it is sometimes here on this show, there's no denying that it has penetrated society in a way that most video game systems have not.
5670679	5672781	Wii Sports is like...
5674182	5676183	Such a typical video game.
5676203	5678303	It's not even a video game to a lot of people.
5678363	5681884	Wii Sports is an activity.
5682024	5684165	It's an activity simulation.
5684325	5686106	People don't say, let's come over and play video games.
5686126	5689006	They say, let's come over and play Wii Sports or the Wii.
5689106	5690127	It's just so interesting.
5690167	5701330	And then on the other hand, you have Xbox Live really kind of, in a way, almost killing arcades because people are able to communicate over the internet and talk while they're playing games and develop this whole community.
5701810	5725994	and then you know some somewhat the PlayStation 3 in this as well but then now that video games are not just about video games but they're entertainment boxes there are these you know sets in our living room that do everything that now that they're they're getting their own TV shows for heaven's sakes I mean I think this current one is is shaping things up in in a huge way that's going to continue certainly it's they're setting it up to have a longer lifespan than the generations before it so we'll see
5726687	5729790	Keep in mind the networking side of it and the web play side of this.
5730410	5734634	Remember we had the X-Link back in the day.
5735115	5736996	We had, well in Japan they had Satellaview.
5737857	5742041	So it's not a new concept, it's a perfected concept.
5742061	5743682	Yeah, but it's now, it's penetrating.
5744643	5748487	Excuse me, has penetrated the marketplace and had its effect on society that Sateleview didn't.
5748727	5749387	Nobody remembers Sateleview.
5749427	5758475	What was a novel concept then is, and actually I didn't even have to say, one of the biggest games that came out that really brought that on was Phantasy Star Online.
5759716	5760357	If you think about it.
5760677	5761117	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5784266	5787788	But see, you know, and I'm really trying to take that question as literal as possible.
5787848	5788988	What's the biggest impact on society?
5789008	5790669	Because if you ask, what's my favorite?
5790869	5793591	Well, the Super Nintendo was my favorite console in that whole generation.
5793611	5795311	Nintendo versus Sega and TurboGrafx.
5795591	5798253	I mean, that was like right when I was in high school and kind of growing up.
5798313	5799353	I remember all that stuff.
5799393	5802095	So that was my favorite generation.
5802155	5805556	But I don't think it necessarily had the biggest impact on society.
5805596	5806997	I think that was more of a bridge.
5807437	5809098	Video games were still a niche thing back then.
5809378	5810519	Master System, and Genesis
5833334	5834837	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5846398	5847058	It's an evolution.
5847078	5853764	I think that's why I want to go back very far back to pinball, Rob, to pinball.
5854905	5859728	Some comments from our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, live on this Sunday night as we tape at All Games Radio.
5861009	5866814	Shaoran says, World of Warcraft just standardized both the best and worst of MMO tropes.
5867214	5870377	Again, it's not necessarily about inventing a concept, it's about perfecting it.
5870977	5873258	I think is an important point that was brought up.
5873679	5874939	Anyway, that was a great question.
5875039	5877721	So I'm going to give an honorary gold star to Salvax.
5877761	5878882	He gets a Twitter gold star.
5879062	5882904	I don't think we've given any of those out, but that was one of my favorite Twitter questions we've gotten ever.
5883024	5884084	So gold star for you.
5885265	5888427	Robocoon wants to clue us in on a Steam UI update.
5888707	5890748	It's a beta thing that you can opt into, and that's good.
5890768	5893870	I think Steam could use a little bit of a facelift.
5894490	5906697	I haven't read this story or familiarize myself with it in advance, but apparently you can take part in the beta by going into Steam's website and the settings link and then selecting the 2010 UI update under beta participation.
5907038	5917184	But I'm looking at these screenshots and I gotta say one thing that does kind of worry me is I'm noticing in one of these screenshots there's like a list that shows community activity and it shows what games your friends are buying.
5918027	5920689	I don't know if I want that data out there and published.
5920709	5924271	I don't want my friends knowing that I just bought the Amazing Unicorn game.
5924852	5926473	I'm hoping there's a way to suppress that.
5926773	5927673	Imagine fairies.
5929174	5931276	I'm sure there is a way to suppress that.
5932472	5952843	but there is there's some unicorn game that's out there on Steam and my boyfriend's been tempting me with this saying you know you want this game you know you want this game when obviously it looks like such crap but it's kind of one of those things like I want to like buy it for you as a gift so you're obligated to play it and then you have to talk about it on next week's OLR during How Was Your Gaming Week like I think we actually had that conversation are you pulling it up right now or what?
5953443	5954724	Sure, I'm going on my Steam.
5955685	5956785	Look for the Unicorn Gamer.
5956805	5958967	I'm going to get a text message in a minute that'll tell me what it is.
5960127	5961268	What magical unicorn game?
5961568	5963029	It's something about magical unicorns.
5963229	5966431	There's an awesome... Okay, not even... Oh, God, here we go.
5966531	5968172	No, no, no, no, no, no.
5968192	5970354	Choo-choo, tangent train, pulling to the station.
5970374	5971474	No, no, no, this isn't a tangent train.
5971494	5976578	This is actually... There's another magical unicorn game that's on... No, don't get me wrong.
5976618	5979699	I set a commercial for this because I watch Cartoon Network at Adult Swim sometimes.
5979720	5980520	Okay.
5980660	5983102	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6009707	6010547	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6033553	6041497	I think this is still worth sharing, so thank you for the tweet because now it's penetrated like Yahoo and it's starting to get onto the mainstream sites about this copy protection.
6041737	6045659	It's Robot Unicorn Attack is what the game's called.
6045779	6050121	It's Secret of the Magic Crystals, Rob, is the one that you're looking for.
6050561	6051062	is that it?
6051542	6073563	it's also gone down to $6.99 oh wow that's a bargain hold on I just got a text message hold on I'm firing up my phone and the screenshot where you do crafting with a magic material called anus that's right one of the screenshots there's a magical crafting I don't know if it deleted his first text where he told me the name of the game but yeah that's the game what is that again?
6074816	6076837	Um, I just found the name.
6077157	6078418	The Secret of the Magic Crystals.
6078538	6079198	Yes, that's it.
6079718	6084580	It's a game about unicorns, and in one of those screens, if you look at one of those screenshots, okay, look, there, there.
6084881	6089402	There's a crafting material on that screen called anus.
6090023	6094885	If you look at it, one of the, like you have to collect anus, but it's A-E-N-U-S.
6096434	6097275	A-E-N-U-S.
6097315	6097976	Yeah, there it is.
6099658	6100338	It's pink.
6100599	6103462	You have to collect all the pink anus you can.
6107826	6108167	Oh.
6108307	6109528	You know you want that game.
6111850	6112291	Fuck it.
6112611	6113172	Add to cart.
6113232	6113652	Reverse.
6113933	6114473	Did you really?
6114493	6115534	Are you buying the game?
6117677	6119578	Right now, I'm buying it for seven bucks.
6119598	6120579	Congratulations, Alan.
6120599	6120959	Good job.
6121360	6121640	All right.
6122240	6128325	And I will have a full review of the gay unicorn game, complete with anus and horn.
6128445	6128705	All right.
6129205	6131287	Let us know how the anus crafting goes a little later.
6132185	6144288	This might need to be our next cause here on the show that we yell and scream for everybody to tweet and Facebook about is to get this on the consoles because I want some pink anus on my Xbox 360.
6144728	6151189	This game apparently, the Robot Unicorn Attack or whatever, has a really interesting song that plays in the background.
6151749	6154970	Although I haven't played it yet, but on the commercial it sounded funny.
6155410	6181647	it's uh the chat room is uh it's erasure always oh yeah that was it yeah because i in fact i actually made a live journal post on this like a while back no i posted it on twitter hold on here's here's a little bit just so just so you have something to reference here loki this is the actual feel oh yeah yeah that's it
6183783	6185464	This is actually one of my favorite Erasure songs.
6185524	6187166	Erasure is a great synth-bop band.
6188467	6191029	I love this one too.
6191749	6193711	Yeah, you play this game.
6194291	6195112	To unicorns?
6195252	6196153	It's amazing.
6196213	6199575	Yes, to unicorns running and farting rainbows.
6199615	6203598	Here we go, Rob.
6203959	6204679	Let's see here.
6207722	6210364	Hold on, Loki's fired this up in studio.
6210384	6211545	Is this a Flash game?
6211765	6211945	Yes.
6215506	6224733	This is... Oh my god, your unicorn was all twisted in a big pile up in the ground.
6225254	6226675	Can you post this link in chat, please?
6226695	6227716	Oh, this is so awesome.
6228016	6229057	Can you post this link in chat?
6229577	6229777	Yeah.
6230038	6230558	Okay, thank you.
6231639	6232600	Maybe put it on the Twitter.
6232780	6235542	Can you post it to the Twitter that we're talking about it on the show right now?
6235642	6236623	You know the password and all that?
6237223	6237484	Alright.
6238004	6238885	Please post that to the Twitter.
6239045	6240326	Also, I just downloaded a song.
6242717	6243958	I gotta sleep eventually, guys.
6267213	6272038	Lastly, a tweet from Alex P. Carson wanting us to give a shout out to Alex Nicole.
6272058	6273039	It's her first time listening.
6273380	6273760	Shout out.
6274961	6275322	Shout out!
6276503	6279226	Hope she didn't turn it off after the farting rainbows chat.
6279366	6280768	Hope we didn't scare her off.
6281348	6281609	Alright.
6283110	6290418	Anyhow, Amazed Shitsuma in chat, yes he changed his name, Amazed Shitsuma says Orange Lounge Unicornio is the new name of the show apparently.
6290999	6292240	Who doesn't love unicorns?
6292821	6293982	Like evil people.
6295023	6295604	Alright, anyhow.
6296125	6302992	Loki, I hate to interrupt you because I know you're running to the Twitter right now to post, but Loki can you give us some more gaming news here on OLRB.
6304654	6305976	Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI
6321552	6342838	and those of course have to do I guess with Abyssia and it's going to have a let's see here Vision of Abyssia I guess will come out during the summer with the other two Scars of Abyssia and Heroes of Abyssia coming soon after that and each new area can be purchased for $10 on the PlayOnlineViewer
6344659	6347201	I'm surprised that there's still expansions coming out to this.
6347281	6349362	I'm not really sure what these new ballerinas are.
6350083	6352845	I mean, this is something that was added way after I left.
6353665	6355907	I totally realized that I never finished my other Twitter topics.
6357268	6357708	You never what?
6357748	6359129	Not my Twitter topic, so rapid fire.
6359509	6360929	Well, then we'll come back to it in a moment here.
6360949	6361269	It's fine.
6361369	6362430	That's all right.
6362930	6368472	But quickly, I wanted to say about Final Fantasy XI and its developments and what have you.
6370092	6379115	This should kind of squelch those rumors that Final Fantasy XI is shutting down in a couple months to make room for XIV, which I always thought was a little bit ridiculous, how fast that spread like wildfire.
6379175	6384337	But this, I'm sure, is in part to shut up those rumors that XI is still being supported.
6386901	6388181	You're not going to fit in there, Shermie.
6389142	6392804	What's Shermie trying to... Oh, Shermie's trying to... She's trying to poop on the mixing board.
6393764	6394204	It's not working.
6394224	6394705	She's trying.
6395505	6396546	End the show, end the show.
6397066	6397306	All right.
6397906	6400828	You got a little more for us, Loki?
6401028	6401248	Yes.
6401388	6408612	Also, Final Fantasy XIV will be going into closed beta soon, actually, starting March 11th.
6409312	6411293	And I believe that they did have...
6414475	6423437	The VanaFest, I guess, the 2010 website, which was some, they had some news, I guess, about Final Fantasy XI as well.
6423938	6433560	But on the PlanetLine website, there's also interesting news, I guess, that the betas will start on March 11th.
6433640	6435161	And I think I've already signed up for this.
6435361	6436561	I want to say I've already signed up for this.
6436621	6439042	Yeah, I signed up for it too, but my email box was empty.
6439082	6441482	I don't know about yours, but I saw that story and then I cried.
6441502	6442503	I haven't got anything yet either.
6442663	6443743	But hey, you know what?
6444063	6446404	There's still time, so maybe.
6446544	6449504	Maybe it's one of those things where I won't be in the first wave, but maybe a later wave.
6449584	6450245	I'll be hopeful.
6450545	6457727	But it gives me time to finish playing XIII because seriously, the beta for XIV is coming out two days after XIII.
6458387	6460927	Two days between Final Fantasy titles in the U.S.
6460967	6461528	if you think about it.
6461628	6462568	That's kind of strange.
6463288	6464149	Well, and here's something else.
6464169	6469772	If you think about it, if it's going into the beta now, maybe those May release dates are a little bit more accurate.
6470172	6472433	I don't know about May, but I bet the end of the year.
6473514	6476576	It sounds like Final Fantasy XIV will be out by the end of the year, and that's kind of weird.
6476996	6480918	I was not expecting it that soon, especially with XIII having taken as long as it did.
6481719	6483740	So, pleasant surprise, I suppose.
6484981	6485141	Yes.
6485361	6485601	Alright.
6486001	6491845	Let's go over to Dark Sakura and whatever stories we skipped over because of all our discussions on unicorns.
6492532	6493412	Unicorn farting.
6493432	6496593	Hopefully it'll leak online just like BlazBlue did.
6515484	6529328	And then there's an online Digimon battle game that's supposed to be coming out in the US that's a version of the Korean Digimon RPG, which I actually think I'll freaking play that because I love Digimon.
6530802	6531162	Digimon Zero 2
6557419	6577110	and um well a couple of movies and I have um like the first two volumes of it on of the Japanese version on DVD someone I used to date a long time ago just went on a couple dates with made me watch the Digimon movie I remember that it's you should watch the Japanese one that's why it didn't last you should watch the Japanese one it's actually really good is it
6577390	6578372	I think I saw the English one
6593471	6594652	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6618550	6646945	so they reach this little settlement well now Activision owns it because of all the acquisitions that go on and so forth and Activision has demanded that this game stop completely they're not honoring the old agreement they have demanded that this cease and desist immediately Phoenix Online has been doing this game since 2002 and then yeah so Activision has basically said even though they don't have plans on doing a sequel themselves by the way King's Quest is pretty much dead
6648516	6649657	I think they should release it anyway.
6650617	6651738	Well, they don't want to get sued.
6651938	6654160	So I can't say I necessarily blame them.
6654340	6656021	Change the name and release it for free.
6656922	6662285	Now, we actually, I believe we had one of the developers on the show many, many years ago.
6662305	6667349	I think you'd have to go back to old, like the To Go podcast from 2005, 2006 to find this.
6667369	6672232	But I want to say we had the guy on the show because I remember going to some virtual press conference online thing about it.
6672672	6693468	and we also hosted a mirror of one of the early betas for the game I believe when it was still called King's Quest I think one of the big things they were touting if I remember right again this is like four or five years ago so please my memory is a little shoddy was that Roberta Williams actually knew of the project and although she couldn't officially give it her blessing she kind of gave it a wink and a nod you know what I mean
6694369	6695991	We hosted the beta for this.
6696933	6698635	I don't believe it went anywhere.
6698695	6702660	I believe it's still on our website at orangelaunchradio.com slash TSL.
6703301	6703982	I didn't get a letter.
6704563	6706645	So, do you want to see what this is all about?
6707106	6707507	Have fun!
6710031	6738839	I think that's kind of a douchey thing for Activision to do when they know they're not I realize they're in their rights to do it just like when Nintendo shut down the movie project the Zelda movie, we talked about this a couple months ago they were in their rights to do it but with Activision just having bought this saying they're not going to do anything with it but then putting the plug on this when they already stripped anything that was King's Quest related out of it that's just douchey Activision gets our douche of the week award there you go
6740876	6766925	so I think that's unfortunate and you know my thought is I'm kind of with Jamie I say release it anyway as a torrent but if you're really afraid of getting the pantsuit off of you seriously go back change the name change some of the text change the characters nobody's gonna freaking know no Activision is not gonna seek it out that hardcore if you go in and change the information so it's hard to detect that it once was the silver lining I bet you you'll have it
6768226	6768587	We'll see.
6769088	6770831	I'm curious to see if the game gets leaked.
6770871	6771492	I bet it does.
6771693	6773977	Once it hits the internet, there is no going back.
6774859	6775259	We'll see.
6776442	6778125	DarkSakura, what you have for us up next?
6779844	6786130	Well, in other news, we have a game called Voice Fantasy.
6786550	6789913	Square Enix has filed a trademark for it in Europe.
6790974	6794097	And maybe it could be a Final Fantasy vocal CD?
6794437	6795918	Maybe?
6796859	6797259	Who knows?
6798160	6799341	But it could be something cool.
6799461	6800642	Hopefully it will be cool.
6801763	6805867	Maybe it'll be like a SingStar Voice Fantasy or something, too.
6807862	6811365	I guess it could be a karaoke-controlled Final Fantasy 1, right?
6811945	6815448	Or maybe one that you have to sing to progress your game or something.
6815768	6816749	I want to fight!
6817469	6818810	I want to cast holy!
6819370	6822492	Or maybe you have to sing accurately to progress.
6823693	6825615	Are you still playing the fucking Unicorn game?
6825815	6826135	Yes.
6828036	6831999	Amaze Shitsuma in chat says, Douche of the Week award, so Shermie will poop on them.
6832665	6838012	Yes, we give a big sure me poop award to the folks at Activision this week.
6838033	6842338	The next time she takes a shit on the floor, I'll take a picture of it so we can just send it to whoever.
6843400	6844141	I like that idea.
6844642	6845303	That's a good idea.
6845823	6848147	Loki, put down the game and read some news for us.
6849805	6850205	Okay.
6851566	6856607	No, this is not a big surprise because I don't think it's really taken off as far as I'm aware.
6857148	6857908	PlayStation Home.
6858548	6863850	Apparently advertisers are ignoring PlayStation Home, but they are interested in the PlayStation Network.
6864590	6873313	Apparently a report coming from Brand Week saying that they're opting to pursue opportunities in Xbox Live instead.
6873754	6877515	Apparently ad agency, looks like a publicist,
6878296	6895719	Dineo, John Rafferty, they told the website for the moment one it felt kind of clunky and once you got through that there wasn't much there regarding I guess the robotic nature of PlayStation Home.
6896972	6921482	and I think it kind of makes sense because there's a lot of places to advertise in PlayStation Home but if you're like me, you don't use PlayStation Home so you're not seeing those ads so it makes more sense to put it on like say banner ads that are on the PlayStation Network or banner ads on the Xbox Live Marketplace because you're seeing those as you're going browsing for other things.
6922262	6923382	I think you hit the nail on the head.
6923943	6928084	There's no reason to go into PlayStation Home except when they launch something new.
6928484	6931985	It's usually you go in there once and you go, oh, huh, and then that's it.
6932285	6932485	Neat.
6932925	6935146	Just like that, remember that salt that was on there?
6935166	6935706	Yeah, yeah.
6935886	6936526	Went there once.
6937206	6941228	I went in there a couple times and played it and got some of the little things and I was like, okay, done.
6942308	6942468	Yeah.
6943257	6944720	I don't really want to pay for this.
6944740	6948205	It's just a souped up version of a game I played on my 386 computer back in 1993.
6948265	6948986	Not really into it.
6959248	6964230	Well, something that a lot of people are into is the idea of Nintendo starting over with a brand new Wii.
6964590	6970452	Well, it came out at the Nintendo Media Summit thanks to a GameSpot cornering Cammy Dunaway.
6971392	6976114	Basically, they say that there's not going to be a Wii successor anytime soon.
6977254	6983436	Apparently they're kind of looking for what happened with the PS2 is that they want to kind of re-emulate the fact that they're on top for years and years.
6984737	6996320	Cammy Dunaway was quoted in the GameSpot interview saying, quote, even though our install base is at this point 5 million households larger than the PS2 install base was at the same point in the life cycle, it still has a lot of room to grow.
6996760	6999681	If you think PS2, there's been about 50 million sold.
7000081	7001382	Wii, close to 28 million sold.
7002902	7021327	so it says to me there's still a big audience out there that we can access with the Wii so basically we still have sold shit loads of these systems so why would we start over with something new just because the core gamers are mad the soccer moms are happy so F you it's raining money at my world ha ha ha
7024100	7052710	so don't expect a new Wii to be announced at E3 this year but I think in great Nintendo fashion their way around this would be releasing the Wii HD or something along those lines where it's not necessarily a whole new system but it's a Wii Plus like the DS Lite or something like that that's what I could see Nintendo doing and then saying well it's still a Wii yeah I don't know we'll see
7053624	7058348	Alright, anyhow, we're going to get into that section of the show where we interact with your emails.
7058488	7061451	It's the mailbag segment here on Orange Lounge Radio.
7062512	7064613	Every week, DarkSakura opens up the mailbag.
7065814	7069297	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com That's all one word.
7069357	7070018	Mailbag.
7070138	7075102	M-A-I-L-B-A-G at OrangeLoungeRadio.com If you have an email you want DarkSakura to read.
7075402	7078064	Looks like a lot of people took the opportunity this week, didn't they, DarkSakura?
7078485	7078805	Yeah.
7078965	7080907	Alright, well, get to reading.
7081437	7082918	Hey, OLR Kardashians.
7083118	7083918	Okay.
7084558	7088199	I just discovered that I could walk from where I live to Valve's headquarters.
7088599	7088879	Yeah.
7089380	7097342	And there's a GameWorks in downtown Seattle that has BlazBlue, Street Fighter 4, Totsunoko vs. Capcom, King of Fighters 1 million, and a few pinball thingies.
7097362	7100003	So if you ever are up there for PAX, I recommend stopping by.
7100223	7100723	We went there.
7100923	7101343	Yeah, we did.
7101383	7102184	We did stop by.
7103084	7105505	They had that whole room of Sega cranes, right?
7105525	7105785	Yeah.
7106745	7107445	And I played a few.
7108225	7111286	Oh, since I'm entering high school, I was wondering if I should learn Japanese.
7111406	7111926	Is it hard?
7112546	7116287	I would kind of want to know what my important future is telling me.
7116787	7119528	Typed with minor precision at 1240 AM, Austin.
7119908	7122589	Just to let you know, Japanese is not an easy language.
7123569	7128693	Um, because honestly I think the biggest difficulty in Japanese is the grammar.
7129474	7131675	Not necessarily the vocabulary, but the grammar.
7132275	7133636	It's a little convoluted.
7133857	7135358	I was a Japanese major for a little while.
7136138	7141042	Um, I know a few sites that will give you beginner lessons.
7141062	7142022	You can find them for free.
7142943	7145365	Um, I think one is called iLearn or something.
7145425	7149047	But yeah, just try a couple of those little online sites and see what you think.
7149548	7152450	Because, I mean, it really is kind of a convoluted...
7153230	7169064	in comparison to English it really depends on what industry you want to get into when you get older and maybe you're too young to know that now if you're just kind of like now going into high school which you're probably too young to listen to this show actually also depending on where you live because when I lived in Alabama it was good for me to know French
7169850	7172331	And here in California, it's really good to know Spanish.
7172871	7173992	It's really good to know it.
7174092	7179374	I mean, there's a lot of jobs out there where they really want bilingual people that speak Spanish.
7179454	7180874	So you might want to think about that.
7180934	7182815	I mean, is Japanese really practical?
7183195	7191439	Well, if you want to get into an industry that has to do with technology and possibly relocating to Japan or working closely with Japanese business or finances.
7191499	7192299	Or going into the JET program.
7192779	7196844	Yeah, any of that, then yeah, Japanese is going to be a practical language to learn.
7197284	7200188	Again, you might be a little young to really know what you want to do.
7200268	7202290	When I was 15, I hadn't a clue.
7202350	7203272	Well, I did have a clue.
7203312	7205654	I wanted to be a game show host, but that didn't quite pan out.
7207136	7209299	I ended up changing my mind when I was like,
7209699	7212281	I changed my major 8 times so don't even worry about it
7227792	7229313	Yeah, but I agree with Akuma JP.
7229934	7230854	Do it while you're young.
7231034	7233215	Learn a new language because it's much harder when you're older.
7233716	7236578	And I tried to learn a second language in high school.
7236678	7237678	I tried to learn Spanish.
7238339	7245343	And unfortunately, this is going to sound terrible because I am a teacher of sorts even though I teach in a corporate environment as my day job.
7245963	7265107	and I think teachers do great things but I had a Spanish teacher that was so terrible she actually ruined Spanish for me like I was not able to learn a language because this lady was so bad thankfully she's not teaching anymore she didn't she didn't keep teaching very long but it's unfortunate that that one person kind of screwed it up you know
7266741	7267121	DDoS servers
7282328	7287232	It seems to me like that would be the perfect target for a DDOS attack to cause maximum damage.
7287612	7295157	A normal DDOS would only disrupt traffic, but an attack against Ubisoft servers would cause everyone's games to shut off and swamp their phone line.
7295798	7298319	I was wondering what you guys thought about this problem.
7298820	7305585	As a side question, I wanted to know what you guys thought about having a homebrew, no piracy, and tech-themed show on all games co-hosted by me and Jaded.
7307586	7308627	By the way, awesome show on the 22nd.
7309628	7310589	Togek DDOS DDOS DDOS DDOS
7339128	7339548	New Blood, Fresh Meat
7361812	7375785	Yeah, I mean, I know they're open to having more ideas, and I know one thing that they don't want is they really don't want more general video game discussion shows, because they already have a lot of them, including us, admittedly, although we've been doing what we do a long time.
7376505	7377526	But I think the idea of a niche...
7381952	7390845	I don't know of a show like that on all games unless I'm really behind on who's on the network right now.
7391225	7395011	So I think that's always a good thing if you think of an idea for a show that no one's done yet.
7396769	7401173	Hey OLR Crew, AZHP here again.
7401453	7406677	I was listening live to your show on Sunday, though I wasn't in chat because I was putting together IKEA furniture at the time.
7407878	7416165	Anyway, when I heard you all report on the Ubisoft DRM that requires you to be on the internet constantly in order to play Assassin's Creed 2, my first thought was, are Ubisoft insane?
7416865	7418467	Do they want people to pirate their game?
7418547	7422590	Because honestly, once it's cracked, the pirate versions will actually be better than a retail copy.
7423188	7423709	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7439185	7467300	someone obviously dropped the ball here and is completely out of touch with gamers I was going to buy Assassin's Creed 2 but after hearing about this I don't think I will anymore now I don't think I'm going to pirate it since I'm not really interested in the game but doesn't it seem like Ubisoft is actually encouraging people to pirate the game so they won't have to deal with that DRM yours truly is HP I just think they're stupid I really have no comment I agree with your email 100% I really have nothing else to say I think what you say is absolutely valid it's just encouraging piracy
7469079	7498671	Alright, next email It's kind of a cool email Hey OLR gang, a quick question here I'm a techie very much like yourselves and I have a few electronics in the house However, it's starting to become a problem as I have a few wires just dangling and crossing under my gaming desk My Wii, Xbox 360, computer setup all share the same space Do you have any personal home solutions or recommendations for organizing an otherwise jungle of wires as well as saving me the time and money in the long run eliminating a potential fire hazard Randy from Texas I do, I have a lot of suggestions because we do them
7500272	7502353	You can get a switch box, first of all, for your systems.
7502873	7505735	You can also, what we do in the studio is we have zip ties.
7506915	7507996	Although we don't really use them anymore.
7508836	7515840	But we have zip ties for our cables for our mics and for the plugs and various hookups.
7516300	7518041	That way we can minimize what's there to trip over.
7518061	7525385	You can also get, I believe you can get them at Fry's or any electronic store or computer store or just in general.
7525405	7526446	You can actually buy them online.
7526927	7527350	DarkSakura.com
7530464	7535466	They look like the plastic ring binders that go on presentation books and stuff.
7536007	7542009	But you bind your cords together and wrap them around your cords and then it leaves them as a long trail.
7542490	7544270	You can also duct tape them to the floor.
7544711	7545731	I mean, seriously.
7546972	7549893	You can use electrical tape to bind them together too.
7549993	7556516	My computer actually, when we put in my card, my new graphics card, we actually just...
7557476	7560299	Electrical taped all the bonus wires together.
7560399	7562662	So there's lots of stuff that you can do.
7563262	7566726	And really, you can get almost any of these things really cheap.
7566766	7567667	You can buy twist ties.
7567707	7569128	You can get leftover twist ties.
7569148	7571731	These little zippy ties we use in the studio or at the 99 cent store, right?
7571831	7571951	Yeah.
7571971	7573813	I bought a pack of eight of them for a dollar.
7575114	7577235	You just have to look around.
7577595	7583598	Really, the thing that you want to do is find something that's going to be non-flammable, something that can bind them together.
7584058	7596805	Honestly, if you want something that's going to hold them securely, your best bet, get a switch box or if you have multiple hookups to your TV, I would get electrical tape and bind the ones to each specific system together.
7596825	7603728	Also, if you leave them at the right length for your binding, you can, if you need to transport them, just unplug them and move them easily.
7603968	7623131	and labels go a long freaking way even though you might be thinking oh what a pain in the butt or you know they're so silly if you just like label your wires at both ends oh my god you will be so happy later if you ever have to move if you use the electrical tape method just get a sharpie right on the electrical tape yeah PS3 you know it's very easy
7623331	7626533	Well, you've seen the box of cables that we have, Rob, obviously.
7627033	7637878	Where it's like you sort of have to look at the end and guess what it is and be afraid if you happen to find an N64 or a Super Nintendo thing because they use the same ones, practically.
7639279	7647963	Or if you happen to accidentally hook up your Japanese PlayStation 2 adapter and then realize it won't fit in your US one.
7648383	7649884	I'm just going off because...
7650624	7659778	it really does help of course we have big bins now in the vault where we keep all of that and don't know which one's which tape
7661935	7662915	Also for speaker cables.
7663436	7663876	I'm just saying.
7665037	7668299	You can get these plastic pieces.
7668779	7671861	For example, we have our surround sound wired.
7672682	7675384	And we didn't wire it under the floor or anything yet.
7676284	7677565	And this is something I wanted to do.
7677585	7678226	We haven't done it yet.
7678266	7682368	But you can get these plastic strips that you can adhere to the floor.
7682469	7684870	They use them in office buildings.
7686031	7690354	To keep you from tripping over wires that happen to be spread for your speakers and whatnot.
7691894	7692535	Good suggestions.
7693375	7694535	Yeah, you can find us anywhere.
7694555	7698977	Just make sure that you get something that's, you know, electronic safe and fire safe.
7700737	7701197	More emails?
7702278	7702618	One more.
7703258	7704078	It's long.
7704098	7705359	Yay, long email.
7706379	7707419	Long email is long.
7708740	7709840	I can't stop playing this.
7711040	7712321	You're still playing the Magic Unicorn game, huh?
7712341	7713941	I'm going to have erasure stuck in my head.
7714001	7715562	I'm going to be having nightmares about erasure.
7717045	7717825	Hello there, OLR.
7717845	7720066	This is G-Ditz writing in.
7720146	7735631	I'm the Swedish dude who called a few shows ago and talked about DRM and seeing as exams are closing in, I can't really spare the time to attend the next live show, so I figured I'd answer the call for European to write about it, the high piracy rate over here, and what might be the cause of it.
7736671	7745018	I don't have a lot of insight on how game releases or pricing works in Italy, where the highest rate of piracy occurred according to the study presented in last week's show.
7745539	7751984	I do, however, live in Sweden, where the famous Pirate Bay BitTorrent site was founded, and where piracy is also frequent.
7753786	7757227	Now there are quite a few factors as to why I have many times been tempted to pirate.
7757907	7758247	Release.
7758927	7764368	One of the biggest factors is for me whether or not I can purchase a product legally.
7765428	7773250	When it comes to anime, for example, there usually isn't a retailer around here to supply them, and if there is, it's all dubbed or subbed in Swedish, which isn't how I like my anime.
7773550	7775550	Agreed, I hate most English dubs.
7777211	7778671	I like watching them in Japanese with subtitles.
7779375	7789343	Another annoying thing is that the delay between US release and the European one, it's usually a week or just a few days, but once in a while a game takes almost a full year to get over here.
7789843	7792065	One example is Rock Band 2 with the instrument bundle.
7792666	7796549	At the time of its release, I didn't have any rhythm hardware for my PS3 and was stuck with a hard decision.
7796989	7798090	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7823989	7829740	As a side effect of this, I now despise Harmonix a bit for not being able to ship hardware in a reasonable amount of time.
7832708	7857299	DRM DRM isn't different for us Europeans but it's still something to consider when buying a product even more if you want to lend it to a friend install it several times or just be able to play it without an internet connection the worst DRM I have to deal with on a daily basis is a CAD computer aided design program used for making mechanical parts and design requires not only a constant online connection but also requires said connection to go through the school network
7857980	7859885	We're using AutoCAD?
7865947	7871730	This means I have to VPN to the school network at all times when using said software.
7872070	7877232	I can't even imagine how such extreme restrictions would urge people to buy it when a pirated copy would mean a lot less hassle.
7878113	7878513	Cost.
7879133	7884496	This is one of the biggest hurdles for many people, myself included, and it goes a bit beyond what Americans have to go through.
7884696	7891639	From what I gather, a new retail game over in the US costs about $60, which would be the equivalent of $450 Swedish kronor.
7894620	7903068	However, we have a value-added tax for each and every item we purchase in stores, where the rate for any item can be 612 or even 25% added to the price.
7903729	7907672	In short, a video game costs a Swedish person 600 kronors, which is the equivalent of $80.
7907732	7915579	Even if I know the tax goes to education, government funding, and healthcare, it still leaves a big hole in my wallet every time I buy a video game.
7916926	7917266	Summary.
7917847	7922989	Hopefully this letter gave you guys a better image of what gaming and the gamer lifestyle is like across the sea.
7923570	7931654	Even if we sometimes get treated as less important market, we still like to support our favorite developers and actually pay for games we enjoy.
7932375	7936817	If you have any more questions, I'd be happy to answer them when I get the time, but for now I have to get back to studying.
7937197	7937878	GDits out.
7938838	7940118	Good luck with your exams, by the way.
7940258	7941138	Yes, good email.
7941739	7949420	I'm a little sad, though, that it didn't come from one of the countries that was really high on the list, because I don't recall Sweden being in the top ten.
7949440	7951840	Well, I do appreciate Sweden very much.
7952180	7953341	Without them, we would not have ABBA.
7954361	7955381	But you know what I mean, seriously.
7956281	7957641	Good email, otherwise, though.
7957741	7959982	It's always good to hear different perspectives from around the world.
7960042	7961142	I found the other email, by the way.
7961362	7961662	Oh, goody.
7961882	7963523	From our buddy, Robaba.
7964143	7965283	Oh, I haven't heard from him in a while.
7965323	7965983	I hope he's doing well.
7966451	7968993	I'm sure the trailers for Super Mario Galaxy 2 will be plentiful.
7969093	7971755	I noticed that the little starbursts don't say you're Mr. Gay anymore.
7972176	7973537	Now they say you're my gay.
7973617	7975458	That's almost sweet in its own way.
7978821	7979301	Oh, Rob.
7979561	7979922	Alright.
7980682	7981043	Excellent.
7981203	7982164	Thank you, Rob-a-ba-ba.
7983264	7983885	Appreciate it.
7984444	7990167	Oh, and yeah, also we got a random voice V-text, even though we've covered this, I'll go ahead and say it.
7990307	7990507	Sure.
7990807	7997590	From, um, I don't want to say the person's name, I'll just say from Sumiragawa-san.
7998210	8001372	Three new characters have been announced for Super Street Fighter 4, Ibuki, Makoto, and Deadly.
8001552	8002272	So, we've covered it.
8002492	8004413	I wonder if that was sent during the show last week.
8004453	8004973	I bet it was.
8005113	8005593	Probably.
8005613	8006433	Yeah, there you go.
8006533	8007634	But I still wanted to read it.
8007674	8008674	It was short, and why not?
8008834	8009174	Why not?
8009574	8010555	We like to read our emails.
8010615	8014036	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send emails.
8014256	8014936	We like emails.
8014976	8016016	So hopefully we'll get some more.
8016916	8024499	Meantime, let's do our FUs of the week, because good lord, we have no shortage of angst this week after all these Activision stories we're hearing.
8024579	8028000	So I think we all know who's getting this dedication tonight.
8043271	8049333	I'll give you a hint, his name is Bobby and I'm not talking about the always awesome Bobby Blackwolf.
8049993	8050613	DarkSakura.
8051393	8053694	Um, well, okay, fuck Activision, whatever.
8054654	8059296	Um, fuck Shermie's poop for sticking up the house.
8060056	8062717	I seriously have no idea what the hell is up with my damn cat.
8064181	8066082	She's only started doing this in the last month.
8066182	8067202	Just pooping.
8067763	8068303	Randomly.
8068363	8069863	She'll use her box, don't get me wrong.
8070264	8074926	And then she'll be like, Oh, by the way, Mom, I have left you a little brown present in front of the bathroom.
8076686	8084870	And, um... F you to stomach problems that kept me from going to the Purim spiel last night.
8085970	8089652	I was looking forward to my first Purim, but I hurt myself.
8091141	8091821	Maybe another time.
8092521	8094522	We're sorry, but our Purin is in another castle.
8096422	8096722	Loki!
8097982	8113026	F you to people that find it necessary to stop their car a good four or five car lengths behind the other car that's in front of them, preventing you from going around them because they're douchebags.
8113266	8118347	Not only that, they kind of drive slow or take turns really wide or take turns really slow.
8118867	8119647	So F you to bad drivers.
8122273	8124515	I don't really have a lot of FUs, to be honest.
8125175	8128637	I'm relatively in a good mood, all things considered, but FU to moving.
8128677	8130358	That's just been the one thing that's been on my mind.
8130538	8135921	I will be so happy that next week it will be over and we can get on to other things like Final Fantasy XIII.
8135941	8139063	One more, one more.
8140484	8141184	No, you don't have to play the music.
8141204	8141825	Now I gotta go.
8141925	8142605	You don't have to play it.
8142625	8143486	No, I don't have to play the music.
8143506	8143906	There it is.
8144046	8144246	Sims 3.
8144286	8147428	Why are you giving an FU to your favorite game or one of them?
8147794	8148916	because it's not loading.
8149557	8150498	I think it's because of my mod.
8151420	8157569	I mentioned it in part A. A couple more news stories for you guys and then the Skype line.
8158090	8161495	Brace yourselves, it's always an adventure where every gamer has a voice.
8162658	8165600	Monster Hunter Tri is coming out April 20th.
8166601	8172245	It will also be available in a bundle with the Classic Controller Pro.
8172265	8175227	The Classic Controller with the extra little grips on them.
8177108	8180670	That bundle will be available for $60 whereas the game will be just $49.99.
8183232	8197469	GameStop will be offering demo discs starting March 8th for those who pre-order and also those who pre-order will get themselves a card for 500 Wii Points, so basically $5 back.
8198570	8227217	but not only that the online play will actually be free to play as opposed to what's in Japan where you actually have to pay to play the game so it'll actually be free to play online which I'm sure is very happy news for fans of the Monster Hunter series I don't know it's neat looking that's happy news for anybody free is awesome no one likes to pay for stuff anyways
8228715	8229677	Sometimes you have to.
8229717	8230919	That's how society works.
8231601	8232062	Yeah.
8233364	8234106	Damn commerce.
8236744	8247948	Alright, one more story for you guys and then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio and that has to do with the teaser trailer that was released this week.
8249568	8254470	There's a new teaser trailer that just hit the internet for Pac-Man Battle Royale.
8254550	8258651	Yes, it looks like that early trademark that was discovered is true.
8258751	8262072	There is a new Pac-Man game coming out and it's called Battle Royale.
8262572	8264513	Outside of that, what else is this game about?
8264933	8268715	I don't know because this is probably the worst teaser trailer I've ever seen in my life.
8268815	8269995	It's 13 seconds.
8270095	8270336	Ready?
8270396	8270856	Here it is.
8271316	8272556	There's the Namco logo.
8272937	8275798	And then... Oh, yes.
8275878	8276538	I know that noise.
8276578	8277339	That's Pac-Man.
8278639	8279419	There's the logo.
8280120	8280520	That's it.
8280680	8282321	Sneak peek at Amusement Expo 2010.
8282361	8284562	That was the whole teaser right there.
8284742	8285842	They didn't tease anything.
8287483	8288824	We already kind of knew about the game.
8288884	8289484	It was a tease.
8289684	8292405	We're going to tease you and let you think that we've given you a teaser.
8292665	8293426	Oh, tease.
8293666	8293926	Right?
8295549	8322483	But you can see at least on the logo that there are four different colored Pac-Mans There's a yellow, a red, a pink, and a blue Kind of like the ghosts in a weird way Although I believe one of the ghosts is orange, not yellow, but still It's chasing a ghost But they are chasing a ghost So maybe it's some type of multiplayer Pac-Man CE That seems to be the popular thought as to what this is all about Plus they are showing this at the Amusement Expo 2010 So the thought is, hmm, arcade game?
8324624	8325265	Arcade Games
8353700	8354941	Hey Rob, this is Footy Monster.
8355061	8356783	Hey Footy Monster, how are you?
8357864	8359606	Oh man, I tell you it's been a couple of days.
8360426	8365791	Now for those that don't know, Footy Monster is one of our listeners who lives quite a distance away.
8365831	8367853	Where do you live, Footy Monster, for those new to the show?
8368634	8370055	I'm in Chile right now.
8371257	8375000	So that's the big place that's on the news lately because of an earthquake.
8375240	8376361	Yes, we've heard about it.
8376401	8377903	And where exactly in Chile are you?
8378584	8381966	I'm actually in Santiago, like in one of the major cities that was hit by it.
8382467	8386349	Wow, but you're calling into the show, so your internet's working.
8386369	8387290	I mean, is everything cool?
8387310	8389952	Actually, my internet was working before my phone worked.
8390492	8390552	Wow.
8390572	8391232	It was crazy.
8391533	8392633	I don't understand how that happened.
8392673	8399518	The first thing I could do to tell like my mother in Argentina and like my friends and stuff that I was okay was through Facebook.
8400339	8400619	Wow.
8400639	8401399	It was the weirdest thing.
8401679	8401840	Wow.
8402640	8405982	Uh-oh, this kind of leads into that whole talk we were having about social networking.
8406002	8406422	Did you hear that?
8406442	8409584	But didn't I say that there are legitimate reasons and then there's just the crap?
8409764	8412726	Yes, but it's still interesting in this context.
8412746	8418889	Honestly, in that context, the first click I did was to hit submit to say I'm okay.
8419269	8421910	DJ Ranma's idea that I call in to let people know in case they hadn't heard but
8443516	8444196	No, that's good to know.
8444236	8445577	Are you still doing a regular show?
8445637	8449020	I know you used to do the role-playing show, but I think you guys put that on hold, right?
8449441	8456968	Yeah, well, I moved here to Chile last year, and I had to put it on hold because of work and not knowing my schedule and stuff.
8457448	8459790	So I didn't put it on hold myself.
8460170	8465775	I gave the show, like the reins of it, to one of the co-hosts, and he decided to put it on hold indefinitely.
8465856	8466616	So that's that.
8467717	8473404	But, you know, I've been, like, about two weeks ago I was guesting on Video Game News Radio.
8473824	8474264	Oh, fun.
8474865	8477548	So, you know, I was there if you care to listen to my musings.
8477788	8479030	Are those the guys in Cleveland?
8479370	8480271	Or am I mixing my shows up?
8480291	8480672	Yeah, they are.
8480752	8481032	Okay.
8481172	8481473	Oh, wow.
8481513	8481793	Okay.
8481973	8482313	Cool.
8482774	8485357	They're the other guys that have been doing a show forever.
8485557	8486758	Like, I think they've been on about as long as we have.
8486778	8488480	Yeah, they've been doing this show as long as you guys have.
8488520	8489001	It's crazy.
8489021	8489081	Wow.
8489221	8489702	That's cool.
8489722	8491585	Yeah, it's a very different show than us.
8492726	8500999	You must have been calling in to talk about Halo 3 or some of the shooter games, or the Call of Duty type stuff.
8501780	8504263	That's more the type of stuff they get into, right?
8504944	8509047	The best thing that they do is when they talk about nothing that's related to video games, honestly.
8509067	8514910	They just go on rants about how one of them is a trucker, the other one is, you know, out of a job, and it's hilarious.
8514930	8515270	I don't know.
8515550	8519513	How interesting that that would be the interesting part of their show, too.
8519953	8521454	Honestly, they actually had a spin-off.
8521514	8527997	They have a spin-off show that they called Midwest Wasteland, I believe the name, and that's all they talk about.
8528017	8532700	They just said, you know what, we're going to scrap the video game part of it and just go with what people actually like.
8533561	8534161	So it's pretty funny.
8534361	8543266	It's interesting you bring up spinoff shows, because, you know, Jamie was doing a comic podcast for a while, and I know she had to put that on hold, but there might be other spinoff shows in the works.
8543286	8545587	You never know what might be coming, so stay tuned.
8546307	8548608	So, yeah, you know, I just wanted to call in about that.
8549089	8553511	I didn't get heard more than, you know, Scraps, Bruces, that kind of thing from...
8554051	8557394	You know, moving debris and stuff because one of our walls actually came down.
8557574	8557914	Wow.
8558415	8562518	That separates our wall, like our house from the neighbors and it fell down on our cars.
8563019	8563719	Oof.
8564059	8566742	So, our cars are now, like, you know, they're covering rubble and...
8567304	8569085	Now they need to be repaired and stuff.
8569146	8571507	I remember Jamie had a wall fall on her car and it wasn't even an earthquake.
8571527	8572108	I was just about to say that.
8572128	8573049	Yeah, I remember that happening.
8573409	8575711	It was at my old apartment complex.
8575771	8581796	We had this sort of stucco and brick wall that was around the dumpster.
8582576	8586820	And we had that windstorm and the wall actually fell over on the car.
8586840	8587300	That's right, yeah.
8587921	8591143	And it just dented one ridge on it from where it impacted.
8591183	8596708	Thankfully, the car was still drivable, although it looked like just an ugly thing.
8597088	8598889	But a car is just a car.
8599329	8600189	A car is just a car.
8600369	8600849	It's replaced.
8600869	8603250	Yeah, that's the only thing I can be thankful of.
8603310	8608812	Although, I don't know, you guys are in California, so you kind of are used to the earth shaking, I suppose.
8608852	8609812	It's not in Sacramento so much.
8609832	8612813	The place we live is not nearly as bad with the earthquakes.
8612873	8615394	We've felt a few, but they're usually not that bad.
8615474	8620216	But I do go to San Francisco a lot, and I have a lot of friends over there, and it's a little more prevalent over there.
8621036	8624237	But it's weird how many earthquakes there have
8624457	8625999	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8645117	8652359	Well, actually, we've been having, you know, the earthquake itself here, where it hit here in Santiago, was about 7 point something.
8653819	8656140	It wasn't quite 8, and at the epicenter it was 8.8.
8656320	8658660	We got 2012, 2012, 2012.
8659460	8666842	If you look at the footage that you will see on TV, it's most likely from that place, which is about 300 kilometers away from here.
8668063	8691500	but still you know in earthquake distances that's nothing like it still hits pretty hard all around so you know it wasn't as bad as that but still what's funny or not that funny actually and that actually has me scared shitless lately is that every few hours there's going to be an aftershock and those aftershocks can reach 6.1 6.5 and all of a sudden you're just doing your things and everything's just shaking again and you know
8692100	8694223	After we're waking up at 3.34 a.m.
8694644	8700791	to an earthquake that fell the wall on your car, you get really nervous all the time.
8700811	8705097	Especially for me, this is my first major thing because I live in Argentina and nothing happens.
8705677	8706759	There's no earthquakes, no tornadoes.
8706859	8709062	Well, I heard they felt this one in Buenos Aires, so...
8710183	8718412	Yeah, but I've been in Buenos Aires when we quote-unquote feel an earthquake and it's like, oh, look, there's a wind gust.
8718652	8719633	And it's like, it's nothing.
8719813	8724198	But being here, I was honestly just, I don't remember being afraid.
8724218	8725379	I don't remember anything.
8725399	8730625	I just remember running away outside, away from trees and walls, just, you know.
8731537	8742425	Footy Monster, just do your best to be safe, and don't live in fear too bad, because if it's your time, then lightning could strike you when you're walking down the street.
8743606	8744546	That's true.
8744747	8752132	Anything could happen ever, so don't live in fear, but always have a plan, and I think this is a good lesson for all the listeners.
8752632	8755974	Even though we're a video gaming podcast, this is still a good opportunity to talk about if...
8757155	8763822	I have one piece of advice in regards to that because it's been baffling my mind what people have been doing here.
8763842	8766865	If there's an earthquake going on, if there's some sort of natural disaster going around you...
8778417	8779718	Don't grab your laptop.
8780038	8781378	Don't grab your DS.
8781898	8783099	Just get out.
8784079	8784699	Be safe.
8784739	8791041	Put some shoes on because that's probably going to be dangerous if you're just walking in a place and try to get shoes at least.
8791461	8793282	But other than that, just get out.
8793462	8794422	Everything else is replaceable.
8796910	8803631	ransacking like supermarkets and department stores and they're taking LCDs with them when they don't even have a house anymore and then to feed themselves.
8803811	8805352	I don't even get it.
8805432	8806652	Like some people are stupid.
8806672	8807992	They react stupidly to this thing.
8808012	8809472	So that would be my advice.
8809552	8810012	Be smart.
8810272	8811733	Just be safe first.
8811873	8813113	Then worry about everything material.
8813433	8818054	That is some unfortunate but necessary advice especially for a tech savvy crowd.
8818534	8821294	Footy, I'm going to have to let you go to get some more calls but stay safe, okay?
8821854	8822095	All right.
8822115	8822575	Thank you so much, guys.
8822595	8823175	We're all thinking of you.
8823275	8823595	Take care.
8824295	8824575	You too.
8824595	8824695	Bye.
8826329	8849586	I hope that's the last of it I hope there's not another big earthquake coming Oh boy Oh boy, alright Well we still have time for some more calls 1-877-GAME-OLR Use name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio Feel free to call in, tell some dick and fart jokes To kind of relieve the tension a little bit, it'd be nice Or talk about the unicorn game with Loki Because he will not stop playing it over there I just found something else disturbing Sure, what's that?
8850807	8854650	The Wonder Twins are on Smallville now Goody goody, what's that mean?
8855804	8863629	Wonder Twin Powers, Activate Oh god, wow Amazing, alright, let's go to the phones Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
8864229	8865810	Hey, it's Ranma, what's up everyone?
8865850	8866951	Hey Ranma, how you doing?
8867091	8867792	We're good, how are you?
8867812	8870093	I'm doing good What's on your mind tonight?
8871054	8884442	Um, a couple of things Well, I want to reference back to the beginning of the episode About how they try to pass that little ban on swearing for a week Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-huh
8885225	8892437	Yeah, a few months ago, they tried to do the same thing here in New York, but they tried to ban the N-word.
8893800	8895122	It didn't get that far.
8896423	8901027	You know, free speech is free speech, so I wouldn't support that.
8901227	8907073	But there's a huge difference between the N-word and the F-word.
8907153	8907713	You know what I mean?
8908234	8908674	Yes, I do.
8910536	8911437	There's a huge difference.
8911697	8915340	I still think people just shouldn't say the N-word out of good taste.
8915400	8918283	Even if we were going to say, you know what, we're going to have...
8918983	8924808	We're going to have our week where we're just going to start swearing profusely in protest of this law.
8925068	8927209	And we're going to say every dirty word we can think of.
8927269	8929011	And we're going to say fuck, shit, piss, so forth.
8929351	8932113	I still wouldn't say that word, you know?
8933134	8933494	Of course.
8933594	8940780	I mean there are times I find myself saying it by accident or depending on the company that I am with, you know?
8940800	8941200	Mm-hmm.
8942915	8950517	But a lot of times I do find it a little bit offensive, but half the time I just don't care because it kind of falls into free speech and it just doesn't bother me at all.
8950897	8951137	Right.
8951317	8954478	I'm like – and I read a comment from the chatroom.
8954558	8957918	GS68 says, wait, isn't not being able to say the N-word censorship?
8958979	8960019	I guess, yeah, it is.
8960499	8969161	But my whole thought is that I just don't want to say that because there's a big heavy weight that comes with saying that word and a lot of responsibility like –
8970261	8972984	It's one of those don't write checks your ass can't cash kind of thing.
8973184	8974525	Does that make sense?
8975166	8986616	So if you're going to say a word like that, you better be prepared for the social repercussions that come with a very emotion-inducing word.
8986956	8995343	Well, Chris Rocks, though, said that if it's Christmas Eve and someone beats you in the head when you're trying to buy the last Barbie doll, that you can call them that for 45 minutes.
8998479	9017771	4 o'clock in the morning within a two block radius and you have to show your receipt I actually listened to that very recently that was funny excellent from Kitsune in chat saying the n-word is disrespectful saying fuck is not unless you call someone a fucker
9018572	9019593	I call people fuckers.
9019633	9020694	I call my husband fucker.
9020774	9021034	I know.
9021095	9023157	I call people fuckers and motherfuckers all the time.
9023237	9025199	Sometimes it's a term of endearment, like bitch.
9025700	9027182	Like, God, Jamie, you're such a bitch.
9027582	9034651	Well, back when I was hanging... But I mean that in a positive, you know... Back when I was hanging out with a certain somebody... Mm-hmm.
9036112	9046022	We actually had a whole conversation about that, about how the only people who could use those particular terms are the ones that it applied to, contextually.
9046582	9049325	They even had a mention of that in the Hebrew Hammer, I thought was absolutely hilarious.
9051187	9054610	So we used to go around calling each other, I guess, the H-word.
9057210	9057751	I'm going to say it.
9057831	9057971	Honky.
9057991	9058231	Oh, okay.
9058511	9060773	I was going to say, what pray tell is the H word?
9060853	9061214	Okay.
9061254	9062255	You know, cracker and everything.
9062275	9062615	Yeah, yeah.
9062935	9065377	You know, because it was like, okay, well, so they can do it.
9065397	9065798	Why can't we?
9068334	9070656	We had that conversation, so we just started going around doing it.
9071477	9073299	You know, as a point of order.
9074220	9083470	You know, it's not supposed to be insulting when you're the one doing it, when it's sort of like you taking it and turning it around.
9084111	9088796	At the same time, you know, if someone else came and said that, it'd be like, oh, insult, blah, blah, blah.
9089096	9089797	You know, but, you know...
9092100	9093321	I could go on a whole rant about this.
9094082	9094622	I believe it.
9114415	9124519	Yeah, like some people like to or love to hide behind that anonymity on Xbox Live and just write checks left and right that are going to bounce, if you know what I mean.
9126660	9126960	Wow.
9127340	9135503	So, anyhow, Ranma, after such a deep conversation, do you have a dick and fart joke or at least a video game you've been playing lately?
9136664	9139825	Video game, but before I get into it, I just want to know, did you hear me on my keyboard?
9141158	9141378	No.
9141998	9142438	Okay, good.
9142819	9143059	Okay.
9144459	9144919	No, you're fine.
9146660	9149080	I downloaded Blaster Master Overdrive.
9149821	9150601	Ah, yes, yes.
9150941	9152241	I talked about this a couple weeks ago.
9152281	9152842	What did you think?
9153562	9154482	I really liked it.
9155242	9157163	My roommate, he's played it.
9157763	9163765	His main gripe is the fact that in the original NES version, you could jump higher with Sophia.
9165990	9168552	I didn't even catch that difference, but that's a good one.
9169132	9169853	He caught that.
9170053	9171794	The controls were what pissed me off.
9171874	9173515	That whole strafing with the button.
9175196	9175457	Yuck.
9177758	9178659	But otherwise you liked it.
9178679	9180140	Classic controller right there, you know?
9180440	9182101	Yeah, they needed the classic controller.
9182441	9186524	There were these few little imperfections with the game that needed to be fixed.
9186544	9187025	You know what I mean?
9189046	9192128	The fact of the matter is we have a sequel.
9192168	9194570	I think we're kind of more excited about that than anything else.
9195208	9195648	That's true.
9195909	9196709	At least it happened.
9197010	9197670	Better than nothing.
9198151	9201033	Alright, Ranma, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you so much, okay?
9201053	9201914	No problem.
9201934	9203956	And have fun with Blaster Master and the remixed music.
9204016	9204476	It's pretty good.
9204617	9205077	Alright, later.
9207279	9208820	We can probably squeeze in one more call.
9209141	9213625	I need to go to Loki, though, if he's taking a break from the Unicorn game and see if there's any last-minute stories.
9213665	9214746	Jamie, too, if she has anything.
9215430	9216471	No, I'm ranting in the chat room.
9216951	9217251	Really?
9217612	9217872	Yep.
9218212	9218512	Okay.
9219053	9222235	Apparently the ESRB has revealed yet another lips game on the way.
9222275	9229620	Apparently it's called I Heart the 80s and it will feature such songs including... Let's see here.
9230741	9235844	It doesn't really say, but they say some of the songs, of course, or lyrics that are in there.
9235924	9236965	She's a very kinky girl.
9237645	9243569	I really need to love... I really love to taste her and you don't have to sell your body to the night.
9244250	9244450	So...
9244864	9246365	I don't even recognize those songs.
9246385	9248807	I recognize, uh, she's a very kink girl.
9249007	9250047	I do recognize that one.
9250928	9251829	That one I recognize.
9252629	9253410	Let's take a quick call.
9253770	9254730	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9254750	9255091	Who's this?
9256151	9256952	Good evening!
9257032	9261915	You, uh, crossed the, uh, supposed, like, oh, what the fuck, I lost it.
9262335	9264637	Anyway, hello there, oh my lord, this is Akira Bird.
9265037	9266938	Hello, it's the other Swedish guy.
9266978	9267639	How are you doing?
9268519	9269340	I'm doing just fine.
9269480	9273242	Now, what do you think about this whole fact that now we have, like, a second Swedish listener?
9273282	9274083	Are you okay with that?
9274952	9277155	What?
9277175	9277756	Did you hear that?
9277776	9278758	I missed that.
9278798	9280480	He called in a couple weeks ago, too.
9280801	9282504	We have another guy in Sweden who listens.
9283377	9310349	Oh damn Of course I know Sweden's a big place I'd be all like do you guys know each other But you know that would be like a little silly Because that's like when people ask me if I see celebrities Because I live in California When LA is like 8 hours away from here And even when you're in LA you don't really see celebrities Because celebrities don't really like to You know they don't really go out in public And shop at you know Vons often you know It's different But anyway what's on your mind I'm sorry I didn't mean to get on the tangent there
9311910	9329507	Well, I have a question for Jamie, actually, since, well, how would, if someone, if a Sims 3 player that plays Sims 3 quite a bit would actually attempt to try to play Sims 2, how would that feel?
9331129	9331909	Wait, wait, wait, say that.
9331929	9333270	Taking a step backwards, I think.
9333310	9336011	Like, if you're a Sims 3 fan.
9336051	9337532	I've gone back and played Sims 2.
9338693	9345876	And it was fun picking up my old games because there's actually, because the mod community, you know, there's so much more out for Sims 2.
9346276	9347737	I could do a whole lot more in my games.
9347777	9349958	I really enjoy going back to Sims 2 every so often.
9350578	9354680	But I'm, wait, Sims 3 is catching up.
9355521	9355721	So...
9357099	9372393	Yeah, well, yeah, because I have been... Because the most fun I'm having is that since I have the World of Adventures expansion, I have this...
9374075	9384262	I like having my sims doing the spar part against each other because the kung fu part is way entertaining, actually.
9384382	9392908	I just have to share, I'm looking over at DarkSakura's desk and World Adventures is sitting right on the desk under one of her knitting projects right there.
9392928	9394990	And then High End Loft Stuff is right there, too.
9395050	9396171	Yep, I just got them together.
9396351	9396711	Wow.
9396931	9398492	I need to reinstall everything.
9398532	9401334	It's just funny you brought it up because they're sitting on her desk right now.
9401354	9402015	I'll take a picture.
9404117	9411040	Speaking of high-end lost stuff, do you think it's worth it?
9411220	9417322	The problem myself is that, well, because I was found like cheap...
9418689	9429917	I found cheap Sims 2 games was that I found the original Sims 2 and a few expansions.
9430338	9436122	The expansions for the second part is the animal thing, whatever.
9436362	9437123	The pets and everything?
9438175	9438435	Pets.
9439516	9446278	And the travel parts.
9448899	9449180	Whatever.
9450720	9456723	And the supposed annoying thing is that, well, the expansion in Sims 2 that I'm...
9457703	9469754	I don't have yet, since the expansions that I'm interested in are the year-round... The seasons.
9470234	9471615	Seasons.
9471776	9472937	Seasons and free time.
9473237	9484267	Because, well, at the current, my Sims 3 game I find is a bit boring, but in a way kind of funny, since...
9485140	9490782	Well, I like to have my Sims sleeping outside.
9493543	9496225	Well, I know that for World of Ventures you've got the tents and everything.
9496265	9503347	To be honest, my whole thing with Sims 2 was really just building houses, which is the same thing I do in Sims 3.
9505308	9506389	I love building houses.
9507069	9509470	So that's really all I do in it, is just build houses.
9510817	9512138	Thanks for watching!
9527908	9532094	or The Sims Resource, you can get all kinds of stuff.
9532274	9542246	And if you sort right for which expansions that you have, you can get all kinds of just really cool stuff that's all made by user-made content.
9542987	9543868	Yeah, but here's the other thing.
9544608	9566945	I don't even know if you can tell me, but the only thing I want to know in any kind of way is that, well, are the stuff that's included in high-end Loft stuff, are there actually a point better than things that you get in the expansion or the original game?
9567125	9569547	Well, I haven't actually got it to run yet.
9571588	9596424	Mine froze because of all the mods I have already installed because I have the no blur mod so you can actually see them naked I hate the blur, it just annoys me and I have a couple of slider hacks so that I can change different parts of the body and I think I might have to reinstall everything to get my games to play
9597806	9604931	Well, I can't say anything on that because I'm using no mods at all, unfortunately.
9608093	9611935	Well, maybe she'll have a better answer for that component in a couple weeks when she gets all that fixed.
9611955	9626905	But kind of going back to the original question, I think the best point that was made by Jamie there was the whole point about that if there's something you want to go back and kind of experience that was in 2, especially with all the mods that were done for it and probably a bunch of scenarios that exist out there on the internet and so forth...
9627325	9628486	That's really the best way to do it.
9628566	9630308	And the fact it's dirt cheap now.
9630588	9636192	Yeah, you can get... The whole Sims Uber collection's gotta be really affordable at this point, right?
9636352	9636913	I think so.
9637053	9640035	I mean, you probably get like... I think they do like whole box sets now.
9640296	9642237	But Aki Ripper, I say take it to the extreme.
9642497	9643698	Go all the way back and play Sims 1.
9644059	9644879	Oh no.
9647521	9650824	I don't think that's possible with my computer since I'm running...
9652385	9657170	Running 64-bit Windows 7 at the moment.
9657190	9658050	How about SimCity?
9658070	9659472	I don't think that's possible.
9659972	9660172	All right.
9660392	9662414	Aki Ripper, we've got to let you go so we can wrap up the show.
9662454	9663876	But thanks so much for the call, okay, buddy?
9664997	9665277	Later.
9665457	9666098	Have fun simming.
9667699	9667939	All right.
9667959	9669320	Thanks so much, guys, for the call tonight.
9669360	9670782	Apologies to those that didn't get through.
9671582	9673044	We had a lot of stuff going on tonight, though.
9673104	9676607	So, again, you can always send us an email and tweets and all that good stuff.
9676909	9677309	Please do.
9677810	9679390	Many ways to interact with Orange Lounge Radio.
9679451	9680571	We always appreciate it.
9680951	9684514	Alright, let's go around and wrap up any other last minute stories.
9684754	9686275	I cut Loki off for that call.
9686695	9687075	That's alright.
9687875	9690937	Pump It Up Fiesta has been unveiled to be coming out March 2010.
9691478	9695740	This is the brand new upgrade for Pump It Up.
9696601	9700943	Isn't this what happened to some of the folks behind In The Groove are now with the Pump It Up folks?
9701243	9701644	I don't know.
9701664	9703665	That's what I thought happened.
9704386	9714468	Apparently, though, Fiesta will strengthen the intermediate steps for pump lovers, mania, and newly improved easy steps for beginners.
9714968	9718889	Players also have the option of versus mode in Fiesta.
9720289	9721069	Let's see.
9721309	9725790	Separated interfaces to better accommodate general players and pump lovers from the start.
9726450	9732291	Users can play one of the custom-made steps by using USB, so custom stuff's kind of cool.
9732971	9740573	and Fiesta is compatible with both personal USB and pump USB, whatever that... I imagine they're all about the same anyways.
9740613	9742593	Well, go have a Fiesta with Pump It Up Fiesta.
9742613	9744674	And they do have a partial song list.
9744974	9745694	Not a siesta.
9746214	9749655	I'm trying to see if there's anything other than Banya stuff on here.
9751435	9752355	Oh, good old Banya.
9752815	9753476	Tons of Banya.
9754396	9755616	Banya production stuff.
9757406	9761714	They did a remake of Turkey March, I guess.
9761754	9763197	That's been in pump forever.
9764179	9768247	A lot of remakes and remixes in there.
9768267	9768768	That's kind of cool.
9770690	9773833	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9791948	9798790	Even though the game just came out last week, New Line Cinema has optioned the rights for the film adaptation of Heavy Rain.
9799590	9802671	Even though the game plays out pretty much like a film anyways, I guess I could see that.
9806632	9811754	And then... That's pretty much all I wanted to talk about.
9813251	9813591	All right.
9814232	9819195	Well, that's going to bring us to the close of a show, but not until we go around and get everybody's final thought.
9819215	9825719	But first, let me say a big thank you to everybody, of course, for tuning in and supporting Orange Lounge Radio and supporting independent podcasting.
9826560	9828121	We don't really make any money off this show.

9832764	9836527	All we ask, just tell one or two people about the show and help us spread the word.
9836547	9842391	And of course, we always do love, love when people post kind reviews of us out on the internet, whether it be on
9843571	9847674	Thank you guys so much for all the kind words about us on the internet.
9847734	9849254	Okay, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
9849274	9849935	We'll start with Loki tonight.
9849955	9850795	Loki, what's your final thought?
9861656	9870201	I can't wait to go home and install Hyper Spin 1.0 into my cabinet and finally drop down that list of games so I can actually play some stuff.
9871542	9874144	My final thought is Itchy.
9875284	9875745	Tasty?
9876005	9877085	Yes, DarkSakura.
9877546	9878046	Tasty.
9879207	9880207	That's your final thought, Tasty?
9880447	9881488	You said Itchy, I said Tasty.
9881568	9882148	Alright, there you go.
9882309	9882989	Itchy and Scratchy.
9883329	9884010	No, Rob.
9884570	9885931	I know, I know.
9886611	9887512	And Jill, yeah, I get it.
9888732	9890293	You don't want to end up a Jill sandwich.
9890313	9890994	What?
9892668	9893950	Anyhow, thank you guys so much.
9894511	9896293	We'll be back here next week to do it all again.
