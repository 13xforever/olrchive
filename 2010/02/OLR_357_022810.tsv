0	16800	Tonight, February 28th, 2010.
16800	18360	Which country has banned heavy rain?
18360	22960	A date is announced for the Final Fantasy XIV beta, and a Nintendo Press event brings
22960	29760	us a barrage of Wii and DS news.
29760	35640	Hello, my friends, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, that talk show
35640	41080	on the internet, live every Sunday night, dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming
41080	42240	culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42240	44480	It is the show where every gamer has a voice.
44480	48720	We do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern time
48720	54480	at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf Show.
54480	58160	A big thanks to them for letting us steal their bandwidth every single week.
58160	61240	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you over the next few hours, I'll say hello to the one
61240	62240	and only DarkSakura.
62240	63240	Meh.
63240	64240	How are you?
64240	65240	Meh.
65240	66240	Meh.
66240	67240	Meh.
67240	70880	I have one thing to say to the California government.
70880	71880	Meh.
71880	72880	Fuck.
72880	74800	I'll get into that in a little bit during housekeeping, absolutely.
74800	78760	If you wonder what she's talking about, and it's not just an unbalanced budget, but there's
78760	80640	other stuff going on, you've probably heard.
80640	84160	I think it's made those water cooler press stories this week.
84160	87600	And boy do we have the response for you, we're gonna get into that in a little bit.
87600	90560	Uh, we do talk games too, right, Techmaster Loki?
90560	91560	Also here joining us every week?
91560	92560	Um, yeah, every now and then.
92560	93560	How you doing, Loki?
93560	94560	I'm doing okay.
94560	97040	I like that, every now and then we do decide to get around to games.
97040	99280	So today was the end of the Olympics, right?
99280	100800	Um, apparently it is.
100800	101800	Are they done?
101800	102800	The closing ceremony?
102800	103800	I guess they're done.
103800	107360	Okay, good, we won't have to compete against them anymore, cause our listener numbers have
107360	109520	been down, cause people gotta watch their curling.
109520	112480	Yay, the office is gonna be back on, that makes me happy.
112480	116840	Alright, all the shows, are you excited about the Tonight Show with Jay Leno?
116840	118800	Oh, I'm not watching that.
118800	119800	Yeah, nobody is.
119800	120800	Alright, uh.
120800	123640	Yeah, I'm boycotting him.
123640	126040	Nobody with any taste is.
126040	127800	My grandma's happy, I'll tell you that.
127800	129800	Alright, let's get into our gaming weeks.
129800	133240	Yes, once in a while we do talk about video games here, and we let the gamers have a voice
133240	136840	in our chat room, chat.orangelauntrady.com, but don't worry, if you're not listening live,
136840	140420	if you're listening on the podcast feed, there are a million billion ways to communicate
140420	141420	with the show.
141420	144000	If there's a social network for it, we're probably on it somewhere.
144000	148000	Uh, the Twitters, the Facebooks, we take emails every week.
148000	149000	All of it.
149000	151980	And phone calls a little later on too, so uh, yeah, we'll look forward to chatting with
151980	152980	you guys.
152980	154540	Uh, let's get into our gaming weeks though.
154540	156000	Let's actually bring it to games, video games.
156000	158120	What have you been playing this week, Dark Sakura?
158120	162120	Um, not really much of anything, I really haven't had any time.
162120	164860	I've been, had a very, very busy week.
164860	168560	I've played a little, actually no I didn't, I actually played any Star Trek Online this
168560	169560	week, I don't think.
169560	170560	So.
170560	171560	Wow, are you okay?
171560	172560	Are you feeling okay?
172560	173560	Real life.
173560	174720	Well, that happens.
174720	180040	I've had lots of homework to do and lots of, you know, responsibilities to take care of,
180040	181040	so I haven't really played anything.
181040	182760	Well, you gotta take a break once in a while.
182760	188080	Although I've tried to play my Sims 3 and it probably hates my mod, so I have to reinstall
188080	189080	it, so whatever.
189080	192160	Well, Loki, how about you, have you been playing anything this week?
192160	199680	Um, just a lot of Borderlands, um, I've been trying to go through and finish Mad Moxie's
199680	204320	Underdome and unfortunately didn't get a chance to do that because the ones I'm on now are
204320	213760	the 20 round matches, which, each round has 5 waves in it and it takes forever, so, unfortunately
213760	217040	I made it only through 7 rounds before I realized I'm not gonna be able to finish it in the
217040	221600	time that I had, so I quit that and played a little bit more just the standard campaign
221600	228580	now, but I'm almost maxed out as far as, um, you know, my level goes.
228580	233320	But I am kind of trying to collect some weapons and stuff because, you know, I downloaded
233320	240480	the new expansion, um, and unfortunately the new expansion kills any mods that you have,
240480	246760	so can't use my modded weapons as cool as they are, so I just have to find something,
246760	251000	you know, newer ones to use, but, I mean you can still mod weapons, you just can't go crazy
251000	256440	with them now, you can't put like shotgun parts on a pistol or, you know, rocket launch
256440	261960	parts on a machine gun or whatever, you just have to keep it within the rules of the game,
261960	265360	so I don't know, it'll be fun.
265360	271040	Um, and then of course, more Grand Theft Auto and, uh, doing well on that, still trying
271040	280780	to move up the leaderboards and, uh, I broke 200 now for cumulative, uh, ranked death matches
280780	293280	and I'm, I think, almost like in the 60's for, uh, true skill rankings, so, it's going
293280	295440	pretty well, I'll be up there pretty soon.
295440	299720	The only problem is though, is those guys that are actually in the top of the true skill
299720	307000	ranks, they tend not to want to play games, um, that they're losing, apparently they drop
307000	310640	out and so it doesn't, their rank doesn't go down.
310640	315140	So I actually did run into some people, I actually ran into the number one player and
315140	319760	like the number six player and both of them did not want to play me, which is too bad
319760	322320	because I would have kicked the crap out of them.
322320	324760	That's it, that's why I'm playing this week.
324760	327960	And you still have a cold, you were sick last week and you're still sick.
327960	328960	Yeah.
328960	329960	Are you feeling okay?
329960	330960	Um.
330960	331960	Do you need some medication?
331960	338080	No, I'm fine, I took two days off this week and that's where I play a lot Borderlands,
338080	344840	and did other things, but uh, you can't really go into that because a wife would not be happy.
344840	351020	Alright then, fine, uh, okay, my gaming week, actually I had a week similar to Jamie's where
351020	352960	a lot of real life stuff is coming into play.
352960	358800	I'm still working on the whole moving thing, which will be done like tomorrow, so thankfully.
358800	362840	But I did play a little bit, I did get into World of Warcraft of course, my boyfriend
362840	366320	and I have been leveling together, I helped him kind of get started with the character,
366320	369600	actually no, I take that back, he started the character and by the time it got to about
369600	374040	level 21, I don't remember, 23, somewhere in there, we started leveling together and
374040	377680	now we just hit 50 this weekend, so yay to leveling.
377680	381000	It's kind of fun to have somebody to always play WoW with, it's cool.
381000	384400	You know, I'm really trying to get as much Borderlands in this week, because I have a
384400	388080	feeling I'm going to have Final Fantasy 13 by the end of this week, and oh my god, everything's
388080	389080	going to stop.
389080	392700	Wait, wait, wait, is your connections getting that early, because I want to place an order
392700	396080	if so.
396080	401400	I don't know if we have extras, but I will check, that's for sure.
401400	404120	You can count on me coming over on Saturday if that's the case, oh no, I'm going to be
404120	407120	out of town this weekend, oh well, Monday, Monday for sure.
407120	410800	Alright, well anyway, all that stuff aside, yeah, I'm very excited about Final Fantasy
410800	414280	13, I was very busy with movies, I didn't play a lot, but I did have one night earlier
414280	419360	this week, I just decided to have a retro 360 arcade night for the heck of it, because
419360	424520	I was joking on last week's show that, you know, we had this story where it came up at
424520	428800	some point during the show that the former Midway games had all disappeared from Xbox
428800	432920	Live, Joust and Smash TV, so I had a night where I just decided to play a bunch of retro
432920	435600	games, I went in, I played Joust, I went in, I played, I don't think I actually played
435600	440480	Smash TV, I started playing Jyris for a while, for some weird reason, like, well, it's not
440480	443040	a weird reason, I just really love that game, it's one of my favorite shooters from the
443040	444040	80s.
444040	447960	I actually beat my former high score, which isn't very good, I need to work on it.
447960	451920	You know, Jyris, and a lot of the old arcade games admittedly, is all about memorization,
451920	455580	like knowing where the ships come from in every wave, so I just really need to kind
455580	458480	of work on it for a little while, but I got a better score, so that made me happy.
458480	462440	I think I beat my score on another old game too, and I can't remember which one it was,
462440	465720	I don't remember if it was Time Pilot or, no, I think it was like Tempest, again though,
465720	467840	my score is still not very good, I need to work on it.
467840	474240	Yeah, as I mentioned, you know, one of the things I did while I was sick is worked on
474240	478780	something that my wife would not like, and that is I'm building up parts of Arcade Cabinet
478780	484640	for work, so that's actually coming along pretty well, it looks pretty nice.
484640	489620	But I'm excited because today, actually, they released the new version of Hyperspin, which
489620	495740	is the frontend I use for my cabinet, and the thing I like about the new one the best
495740	503000	is they have a way to add games to your favorites list, really simple, and that's going to make
503000	509500	cutting down the list of 5,000 games to what I'm actually going to play a whole lot faster
509500	514760	than I was doing it before, so I'm actually going to be downloading that probably when
514760	519880	I get home, and I'm going to go through my cabinet and get it all ready to go, but actually
519880	526880	I put a second brand new graphics card into it so that I could play BlazBlue Continuum
526880	534480	Shift at full speed, and I can now, and it's awesome, but for some reason, an IOMI version
534480	540000	of Marvel is Capcom 2 still has slowdowns in it, but it's not by my computer because
540000	542680	it's certainly fast enough, so.
542680	546040	Let me ask kind of like a random MAME question, because I'm going to be honest, I haven't
546040	551160	played MAME, the Arcade Emulator, in quite a long time.
551160	555400	Did it ever get to the point where, like, it does more things online, like the exchange
555400	558740	of high scores or like an online leaderboard or something?
558740	562960	Because I really see that as being some of the big appeal of Game Room to me, the legitimate
562960	566400	MAME or whatever you want to call it, I think it's really cool that I'm going to have leaderboards
566400	570360	with friends and, you know, some of that medals and achievements element.
570360	573800	MAME is just flat out emulating the old games, right?
573800	575200	They didn't add any frills to it?
575200	579040	They didn't really add any frills to it, you can get ones that'll do different things,
579040	584720	but it's mainly they're just looking for the actual arcade emulation that, you know, using
584720	592960	just your processor and, you know, no, you know, using your graphics card for anything.
592960	597760	As far as playing stuff online with each other, they don't really have that.
597760	601760	And I can understand, you know, the high scores and stuff, that'd be kind of tough.
601760	608040	I mean, they do have patches now that will save your high scores, but nothing that you
608040	609360	can play online with each other.
609360	617320	They may have, like, you know, there's other programs out there like MESS or Misfit MAME,
617320	621280	which will run all sorts of hacked games.
621280	627440	Maybe those will have, you know, some sort of online play or something, but MAME does not.
627440	630640	Honestly, it does make sense, though, that there's not a lot of frills, because MAME is
630640	633680	sort of in that really gray area of legality as it is.
633680	637520	I mean, there's nothing wrong with the MAME program itself, but it's the fact that, you
637520	642960	know, the ROMs are not legal, except for a handful, you know, there have been a few that
642960	647560	the original creators of the game have come back and said, yeah, that was like 25 years
647560	652120	ago and we're not going to make any money off of it, so we hereby release it in the
652120	653120	public domain.
653120	654120	Woohoo, have fun.
654120	655680	There have been a handful of those games.
655680	660280	So I think if MAME were to come in and say, oh, we're going to implement this online leaderboard
660280	664320	for this game, it would really kind of start to push the boundaries of the gray area of
664320	665320	legality that it's in.
665320	668880	It'd be tough to do it, and it'd be tough to make sure people aren't cheating in it,
668880	669880	and just...
669880	670880	True.
670880	672440	It'd just be too difficult.
672440	682160	But I do believe, actually, that I think Macaron or maybe Demul, one of the Dreamcast emulators,
682160	683680	is actually doing online.
683680	686040	You can play multiplayer over, like, the internet.
686040	687040	No, that's cool.
687040	691840	And I know those do Niomi games, so like Marvel vs. Capcom 2 or...
691840	695520	Did they ever perfect it on the NES or Super Nintendo, because I remember some of those
695520	700520	old, old emulators, like, I want to say, like, Nesticle, even, if you remember that one,
700520	705040	and Zessness had internet play, but it was kind of wonky.
705040	707120	Did they ever perfect that?
707120	708120	I think those have gotten better.
708120	709120	I don't know.
709120	710120	I don't play over the internet with that stuff.
710120	711120	The same with MAME.
711120	717800	I mean, it's my, my cabinet, unfortunately, the motherboard in it's really cheap, and
717800	721320	so anytime I overclock it, the ethernet stops working, so...
721320	727880	Well, I've always said I would love Nintendo's Virtual Console if it was on Xbox Live.
727880	730680	That's what I've always said about Virtual Console.
730680	734400	We're going to get into this more later, but I'm honestly surprised at the release schedule
734400	739200	that they have right now, so maybe they are coming around, I mean, because that's basically
739200	745800	all the games that they announced at E3 coming out before E3 this year, so it's like, okay,
745800	748480	clean slate, what are you going to announce for the rest of the year, you know?
748480	750320	Yeah, we'll get into that a little bit, though.
750320	752720	Before we get into the gaming news, let me do some housekeeping tonight.
752720	756160	We don't have a whole lot of housekeeping here in house, but something Dark Soccer referenced
756160	758960	a little earlier in the show, I just kind of wanted to share this and throw this out
758960	765000	there with you guys, apparently the California State Assembly passed a measure this week
765000	769000	that is going to support anti-swearing week, or what do they call it, no cussing week,
769000	770000	right?
770000	771000	The first week of March.
771000	772000	Yeah, something like that.
772000	774480	So starting Monday, because today's the last day of February, believe it or not, so starting
774480	777340	Monday, it is no cuss week in California.
777340	782360	So if you so much as say fuck out loud, you're going to get hauled off to jail.
782360	784160	No, okay, it's not really like that.
784160	793400	What it is, I don't know, some kid in a club in California started this no cussing club,
793400	798000	and it caught on amongst all these people that think if you cuss, then clearly you're
798000	802440	not intelligent because only unintelligent people have to fill their vocabulary with
802440	805360	cuss words, blah, blah, blah, I don't know, something along those lines.
805360	808160	So somehow this got all the way to the State Assembly.
808160	812600	While we are in the midst of a budget crisis, yet again, mind you, and we can't even go
812600	816400	to the DMV anymore because we're not even sure when they're actually open, because they're
816400	817400	closed half the time.
817400	820880	Anyway, sorry, I don't want to get on the political tangent here too much.
820880	825200	So they found time to pass this resolution to support the no cussing week, and they're
825200	831780	encouraging that everybody should keep a swear jar, and if you say fuck or damn or whatever,
831780	834720	you should put in 25 cents into the swear jar.
834720	843320	So yeah, and you should donate this to charity, to Haiti or probably Chile now, and obviously
843320	848520	our thoughts to everybody who was affected by that recent thing, and I don't have a problem
848520	854500	with donating to charity, but I think I have a little bit of a problem with the government
854500	857760	endorsing something that sort of infringes on freedom of speech.
857760	863520	I mean, call me crazy, and if you look at this dude's website for the no cussing club,
863520	869120	they're selling books, they're selling charters on how to start your own club, gee, the guy's
869120	871080	profiting off this idea.
871080	873960	Are they taxing him?
873960	874960	I hope so.
874960	879520	Well, you know what, you can't knock him for profiting off of it because if people are
879520	883680	dumb enough to pay him for it, then whatever.
883680	890480	I mean, that's what capitalism is built on, profiting off the stupid, so why not?
890480	893840	I'm sorry, again, I don't mean to get on the political train, but this does affect video
893840	897840	games because this is the home of Silicon Valley and where a lot of the games are made,
897840	902080	so you know, if the state goes belly up, so are a lot of your favorite game publishers.
902080	903080	Well they're already written.
903080	907680	I'm sorry, but this non-cussing week is about as, okay, now I don't even want to compare
907680	915200	it to that because this, you know, god damn it if I make fun of Talk Like a Pirate Day,
915200	920840	but I mean, as far as non-cussing week goes, it is about, you know, as, as, uh...
920840	924960	Well, but Talk Like a Pirate Day has not been endorsed by the state of California.
924960	928480	Talk Like a Pirate Day is an internet meme-y, basically, that's gone crazy.
928480	929480	Yeah, exactly.
929480	930800	Is it a 4chan thing?
930800	932080	It might as well be.
932080	933080	You know, it's one of those things.
933080	938560	But, I mean, it's basically about, you know, that important as far as, I mean, and I would
938560	943240	say even less important than Talk Like a Pirate Day because that's actually kind of cool,
943240	949160	but um, you know, it's about that important, like, you know, no one's gonna care.
949160	950720	I mean, they're not doing anything.
950720	953760	They're not punishing you for not cussing.
953760	957200	Most people don't even know that this is even happening.
957200	958200	Who cares?
958200	961360	Uh, comment from our chat room, Tigerclaw, and chat says, you know, this sucks for those
961360	963220	who do podcasts that live in California.
963220	965880	They won't be able to cuss on their show either, lol.
965880	966880	Hold on.
966880	967880	Hold on.
967880	970760	This is just an assembly thing that supports no cussing week.
970760	974440	Nobody can stop me from saying fuck, that's my first amendment right.
974440	979240	I can say fuck and I can say cunt and whole lots of worse words I can think of.
979240	983520	I can say them and nobody can take that right away because I live in America, which is great.
983520	988680	But I'm glad you brought that up because next week's show will fall during no cussing week.
988680	992760	So I do want to point out, we here at OLR, we do have our plan and we are going to bring
992760	996720	you, OLR presents our no cussing week show next week.
996720	998580	So we're looking very much forward to that.
998580	999920	So stay tuned.
999920	1003120	So OLR celebrates no cussing week in the state of California next week.
1003120	1004120	It'll be fun.
1004120	1008600	But why are we giving them more fuel for, you know, their fire, you know what I mean?
1008600	1011600	It'll be fun.
1011600	1014920	We like to challenge ourselves here at Orange Lounge Radio.
1014920	1019020	Let's challenge ourselves with some video game news tonight, Loki.
1019020	1021120	I don't want to fucking do it.
1021120	1026720	Sorry, I have to get that out of there.
1026720	1030520	So this is kind of interesting.
1030520	1039520	Apparently the PS3 developers have now 70 megabytes of additional RAM unlocked to be
1039520	1041560	able to use in their games.
1041560	1047680	Sony apparently has been upgrading the PS3 over the past few months and doing so they've
1047680	1056540	dropped the OS's memory footprint from 120 megabytes to 50 megabytes and basically allowing
1056540	1064600	the system to use less RAM and therefore being able to pass on the RAM to other developers.
1064600	1068100	Now, is that going to really make a difference?
1068100	1069100	Probably not.
1069100	1075080	I mean, it'll help, you know, they want to optimize their code as much.
1075080	1080480	But you know, as PS3 developers have basically said, any bit of RAM helps.
1080480	1081480	So neat.
1081480	1089420	Yeah, I guess a little bit of RAM is better than none, but well, I mean, sorry, obviously
1089420	1092120	there is RAM in the system as it is, but you know what I mean?
1092120	1093720	The more RAM, the merrier.
1093720	1099240	But how is it that this console's been out for so long and now they're saying, hey, we've
1099240	1101240	unlocked this hidden RAM?
1101240	1102240	Is it just because they've optimized?
1102240	1107800	Yeah, they've just optimized their operating system.
1107800	1112360	They basically found new ways to do it for things and now, because it's optimized, they
1112360	1115320	don't need as much RAM.
1115320	1118620	But yeah, I wouldn't expect that suddenly all these games are going to have uber better
1118620	1120160	graphics and all this stuff.
1120160	1123120	I mean, 70 megs of RAM is not that much and all said and done.
1123120	1126440	So what, that's going to be like an extra, maybe an extra splish splash in the water
1126440	1129480	effect or an extra little dangling light somewhere in Silent Hill.
1129480	1136000	Anything I'm surprised they're not using it for like, you know, more, you know, features
1136000	1141600	in the operating system, you know, custom soundtracks in all the games, you know, cross
1141600	1148440	game chat, which I think is still there now, hopefully, you know, video chat or something
1148440	1149440	like that.
1149440	1150440	I don't know.
1150440	1152880	They could be using that RAM for something.
1152880	1158800	Or I don't know, let's see, these consoles, you know, have been out for a while and put
1158800	1164960	more RAM in them, you know, like gigs of RAM instead of like half a gig or whatever the
1164960	1165960	hell's in these.
1165960	1169360	I know it's not more than a gig.
1169360	1170360	It's poetic.
1170360	1176960	But they can't up it after the console's already out because then the games that are released
1176960	1179040	may not work on the older system.
1179040	1180720	So it's just like you have a new console out there.
1180720	1183720	Like remember, like I'm thinking of the Nintendo 64 memory pack.
1183720	1187320	Like, didn't you have to have that little memory pack in order to play like Majora's
1187320	1188320	Mask?
1188320	1189320	Is that a nice game with that?
1189320	1190680	Some games, yes.
1190680	1195760	But here's the thing is, like the PSP, they doubled the RAM that they have for their,
1195760	1201840	well, it's mainly for their web browser, but it can be done.
1201840	1206760	I mean, all it would do is those games would run smoother.
1206760	1207760	I see.
1207760	1210600	But games would still have to be optimized for the lowest common denominator, really.
1210600	1211600	Yes.
1211600	1213040	Or else they're going to find themselves in trouble.
1213040	1218280	But eventually they would phase that out, you know, phase out the old systems and all
1218280	1221400	right, well, one system that doesn't seem to be getting any upgrades in its near future
1221400	1225640	is the Nintendo Wii, but that doesn't stop Nintendo from trying to crank out the big,
1225640	1226640	big games.
1226640	1227840	And they had a big press event this week.
1227840	1231320	We're going to focus on the next few stories talking about for a moment.
1231320	1234180	And of course, some big, big titles coming out of this press event that happened this
1234180	1235180	week.
1235180	1242680	Two of them being Mario Galaxy 2 and Metroid Other M. Sounds like Super Mario Galaxy 2
1242680	1246600	and Metroid Other M are both going to be out mid-year, which was a little bit of a surprise
1246600	1250760	because I think a lot of us were thinking, even though Other M was shown at last E3,
1250760	1253920	we were kind of thinking, oh, it's early, it's going to be out this holiday season.
1253920	1257200	But no, both these games have now been dated for mid-year.
1257200	1262420	So Mario Galaxy 2, I believe they've said, they've even said like, what, May, I think,
1262420	1264400	and Metroid Other M is going to be out in June.
1264400	1265400	Yes.
1265400	1268400	So June 27th, which is the day after my birthday, I believe.
1268400	1273160	So, you know, it's kind of exciting these games are coming out so soon, but what's that
1273160	1274760	mean for the rest of the year?
1274760	1276800	What big titles does Nintendo have left?
1276800	1278920	They've already hinted that they're going to announce a new Zelda game that's going
1278920	1279920	to come out at the end of the year.
1279920	1281560	I mean, that's basically what's going to happen.
1281560	1286000	You're going to have a new Zelda game, probably running in the Twilight Princess engine.
1286000	1291120	And that'll be the new game this year, and everyone will go buck-a-wild over it.
1291120	1294960	So I guess some of the early impressions are out over these games, and Super Mario Galaxy
1294960	1300660	2 is pretty much Super Mario Galaxy 1, but some new worlds and new features and things.
1300660	1302040	Not a lot of differences, though.
1302040	1303320	It's not like the game has suddenly changed.
1303320	1305080	I don't think it has to be, I mean, really.
1305080	1307400	As long as it has B. Mario, who's going to care?
1307400	1314440	Really it was, you know, it was a good game, so you know, don't really need to change it.
1314440	1317480	Metroid Other M, on the other hand, finally we're getting some more details out of that,
1317480	1320960	and it does sound like it's going to be a direct sequel to Super Metroid, which you
1320960	1325540	know has me excited, because I think Super Metroid's the greatest game they ever made.
1325540	1329920	So hearing that this is a direct sequel, well, I do also approach that with caution, because
1329920	1332800	there's a part of me that goes, they could really screw this up.
1332800	1338540	But apparently they have a whole rendered scene of what happens at the end of Super
1338540	1344880	Metroid, is how the beginning of Other M starts, and it's all like rendered in the new 2 to
1344880	1345880	3D type thing.
1345880	1348840	I guess what happens in the game is that you play a lot of it in 2D, but you can actually
1348840	1352160	switch to 3D on a button press, which sounds kind of neat.
1352160	1353460	Is that the first person?
1353460	1357720	It's like Paper Mario or something, which is interesting.
1357720	1361760	So I'm certainly excited about Metroid Other M.
1361760	1366000	If it is mostly a 2D Metroid especially, I'm really excited.
1366000	1370680	I mean, I'm cool with them throwing some 3D in there a la Paper Mario, and you know, it's
1370680	1375520	not that Prime was bad, but it's just I love Super Metroid and can't wait to see a game
1375520	1376520	like that.
1376520	1379680	So I'm sure we'll see more details on this in the coming months, because this game is
1379680	1380680	going to be out now.
1380680	1381920	What, we're looking at March?
1381920	1383920	This game's out in three months?
1383920	1384920	Yeah.
1384920	1385920	Crazy.
1385920	1386920	So.
1386920	1390320	And actually we're getting linked to something on YouTube.
1390320	1393960	I'm hoping this isn't a joke, but it comes from Tiger Claw saying the Metroid Other M
1393960	1396640	intro video was apparently leaked.
1396640	1401040	Oh yeah, somebody's got their little camera here at the press conference.
1401040	1404400	So Tiger Claw just linked this in our chat room.
1404400	1408880	I'm trying to see, and I apologize because I know video doesn't make for great radio,
1408880	1412240	but okay, we see nebulas and clouds and all that stuff here.
1412240	1416120	Let me skip forward a little more in the video.
1416120	1420600	Now whoever's holding their camera's having to hold it a little low, but we do see kind
1420600	1423080	of like a rendered Samus in 3D action.
1423080	1426560	Those graphics look really good, especially for the Wii.
1426560	1429520	I know Nintendo's hoping this will be the game that changes people's minds.
1429520	1432440	Oh, there's the baby Metroid from the end of Super Metroid.
1432440	1433520	Isn't it cute?
1433520	1434520	And the mother brain.
1434520	1437680	Oh wow, that, that actually does look pretty impressive.
1437680	1442200	Oh, remember how the boss shot the laser from her eye and everything?
1442200	1445200	Interesting.
1445200	1446200	That's pretty cool.
1446200	1450800	Oh, whoever leaked that little piece of footage is going to get busted, but that's really
1450800	1451800	awesome.
1451800	1452800	That's cool.
1452800	1457760	If you want to check that out, the YouTube user that has this video posted right now
1457760	1460440	is MetroidBlaster127.
1460440	1463800	That's where we're, where we got linked to by our chat room.
1463800	1468320	I got to say, maybe this will be the game that changes people's minds on the Wii.
1468320	1470320	I don't know.
1470320	1475560	Well, or it's not necessarily my mind needs to be changed because Nintendo does put out
1475560	1478240	like that one or two awesome games a year.
1478240	1484000	If this does well, let's say a Team Ninja Zelda game or a Team Ninja Mario game.
1484000	1486440	Or just a third party with a sacred Nintendo franchise.
1486440	1488400	Or a Team Ninja Smash Brothers game.
1488400	1489400	Ah, hot.
1489400	1491280	That'd be very hot.
1491280	1492280	So we'll see.
1492280	1495240	That'll be out in June.
1495240	1498760	Unfortunately it's not going to be HD because the Wii doesn't support it, but...
1498760	1499760	Who cares?
1499760	1500760	It's good.
1500760	1503480	Yeah, it's, I got to say for 480p it still looks really good.
1503480	1505520	So we'll see.
1505520	1506520	We will see.
1506520	1508240	Well, let's move on with some more gaming news.
1508240	1509520	Dark Sakura.
1509520	1513200	Well, this is about the DSi XL.
1513200	1514920	We've got a date and a price for it.
1514920	1520720	It looks like it's going to be out on March 28th, going to be $190 and I'm pretty sure
1520720	1523760	I don't know if I'm going to get one.
1523760	1527640	Aren't they saying that a new DS is kind of rumored for E3 this year?
1527640	1530000	Like that could be one of the things that they announce?
1530000	1536080	Yeah, it's supposed to be one for $189.99.
1536080	1539720	I'm going to laugh if they do release a new one right after they do this.
1539720	1542120	Well, I know we've gotten into this on the show before.
1542120	1544200	They did the micro after the DS was announced.
1544200	1545200	I liked my micro.
1545200	1547600	I honestly don't think that they need to do another DS.
1547600	1554120	I mean, granted the XL, whatever, they, people might want a larger screen for something.
1554120	1559480	I don't know, they're kind of posing this as like a secondhand ebook reader or something
1559480	1560480	like that.
1560480	1563800	In fact, I think one of the new pieces of software they're going to have with this is
1563800	1566600	like some sort of classic novel collection or something like that.
1566600	1567880	That could be interesting.
1567880	1568880	I would get that.
1568880	1570420	And then again, I use my Kindle.
1570420	1571700	It wasn't this game.
1571700	1577720	There was actually a, or it wasn't the DSi XL that was necessarily kind of cool.
1577720	1584280	There was a, I want to say it's a new DSiWare game that's going to be coming out where it's
1584280	1589240	like a hidden pictures game that you have to search for different letters in this like
1589240	1590240	scene.
1590240	1593840	But what's kind of cool about it though is they almost do like a pseudo head tracking
1593840	1595440	with it using the camera.
1595440	1599960	You actually tilt the system around and the camera changes angles based on how you have
1599960	1600960	the system tilted.
1600960	1605600	Why don't they do this technology with like DSi that might make it a lot cooler with new
1605600	1610400	different games coming out that you have this neat little kind of head tracking technology
1610400	1611400	built in.
1611400	1616280	You know, that would be really cool and kind of a way to differentiate themselves with
1616280	1617280	DSi.
1617280	1619520	Because right now it's like, eh, it's a DS with a camera.
1619520	1621880	They don't like to give us what we want.
1621880	1624580	You know, another big problem with this is the price.
1624580	1627760	I mean $200, right, or $190 or whatever it is.
1627760	1634040	Something like that is supposed to be like $20 more than what the DSi is now.
1634040	1635040	Yeah.
1635040	1639160	But now you're also talking, you could get a Wii for the same price, right, or at least
1639160	1643680	an Xbox 360 low end, right, for $199.
1643680	1644760	So I don't know.
1644760	1648040	I'm not really sold on, again, why I need the DSi XL.
1648040	1649520	I don't have a DSi.
1649520	1650520	I don't have one.
1650520	1653400	I have the DS Lite, was the last Nintendo system I bought.
1653400	1657640	And I probably wouldn't have even bought that if I hadn't kind of bought it as like a knee
1657640	1660000	jerk thing when I was on vacation once.
1660000	1661160	I would still have my DS back.
1661160	1666820	This is really dumb that it's coming out for a price point that's higher than the DSi.
1666820	1669000	Really what they should have done is drop the price of both systems.
1669000	1674920	Maybe put out the DSi XL at the price of the current DSi and drop the price of the DSi.
1674920	1679220	But even then it's like, well, do I really need a larger screen?
1679220	1684960	It doesn't really enhance anything other than the graphics are slightly bigger now.
1684960	1685960	I don't know.
1685960	1688080	I think it's kind of unnecessary.
1688080	1693120	I guess this whole ebook thing you're talking about could be interesting, but is it something
1693120	1695680	that I would not be able to use on the DSi regular?
1695680	1696680	No.
1696680	1699120	No, you wouldn't be able to, but it'd just be slightly bigger on the, you know, and we're
1699120	1700480	talking slightly bigger.
1700480	1704640	I mean, it's not like the screen size is like double or triple of what the DSi is.
1704640	1706120	It's still enough to fit in your pocket, right?
1706120	1710980	It didn't really give me an impression of being anything that fantastic.
1710980	1715800	I just, I don't understand the point of this.
1715800	1720800	Ooh, maybe they're in pretty colors because that would be a big seller as if they're in
1720800	1724000	like, you know, fabulous pink and sexy lavender.
1724000	1727360	I don't know what the colors are going to be, but I think from what we've seen in the
1727360	1730520	pictures is like they have like a wine burgundy color.
1730520	1732040	Yeah, and another one's bronze.
1732040	1735000	I'd get a bronze one.
1735000	1742720	It's so like a third place looking color and then a Franzia looking color.
1742720	1747240	Really, if you want a DSi in a specific color, there are websites out there that will give
1747240	1752000	you a DSi in any color you want, or you can go to the Nintendo World store in New York
1752000	1753640	and they'll give you a DSi color.
1753640	1755680	I almost did that.
1755680	1760080	They had like the custom DS cases and this like really there was a sexy metallic green
1760080	1761080	one.
1761080	1762080	I kind of wanted, but I resisted.
1762080	1767680	I didn't buy it almost as you should have because you probably already have a DS and
1767680	1770040	there's no reason to purchase something because of a color.
1770040	1773640	There really wasn't, except the fact that it was one of the lights and I didn't have
1773640	1775140	a light at that time.
1775140	1776140	So I almost bought that.
1776140	1786360	I did buy my, now I can't remember which letter is attached to it, my pink one because it
1786360	1787360	was pink.
1787360	1788360	I do feel a little...
1788360	1792720	And I wanted to be different than what people expect.
1792720	1793760	Mine are very generic.
1793760	1796360	My DS fat is gray and my DS light is black.
1796360	1799760	It's not my DS, my old SP, not the SP, the one before that.
1799760	1802600	But I feel a little ridiculous having both of them at this point.
1802600	1805960	I'm like, I just need to like sell one of these, but who'd buy it?
1805960	1807440	Do what we do.
1807440	1809560	Get another room.
1809560	1810680	I don't have another room.
1810680	1811680	I just moved.
1811680	1812680	I had to downsize.
1812680	1813680	I don't have as much room as I had before.
1813680	1815520	I got boxes everywhere still.
1815520	1817400	I need to get rid of things.
1817400	1819560	Take my DS to the dump.
1819560	1822320	All right, let's move on with some more news.
1822320	1823320	Okay.
1823320	1827040	So some other interesting stuff that came out of the media summit, Nintendo will be
1827040	1831180	publishing Dragon Quest IX in North America.
1831180	1835200	Which is kind of weird if you think about it, because Square Enix is over here.
1835200	1836600	Why aren't they publishing the game?
1836600	1838520	But hey, whatever.
1838520	1841440	It's coming out over here sometime in the summer.
1841440	1846240	And you know, with Nintendo being the one that's publishing the game, hopefully there'll
1846240	1848880	be a better marketing campaign behind it.
1848880	1850340	So maybe that's good.
1850340	1856400	And because people buy blindly whatever Nintendo puts out, so that's always good.
1856400	1863200	Another game scheduled for May coming to the DS would be Picross 3D.
1863200	1866360	And kind of a cool-looking game.
1866360	1870600	And of course, you know, Picross is kind of a puzzle game where you make a picture.
1870600	1876440	Well, now it's going to be in three dimensions as well, and you'll break apart cubes to reveal
1876440	1879980	different little cube animals and objects and stuff.
1879980	1882920	So that's kind of neat.
1882920	1888560	Kind of a more niche game, but Sin and Punishment 2, or what's being called over here, Sin and
1888560	1892840	Punishment Star Successor will be coming out on June 7th.
1892840	1897160	They had a new trailer for it as well, and it looks all sorts of sexy, and of course
1897160	1903660	it's a shooter game that will be the sequel to the one that came out on Nintendo 64 way
1903660	1904960	back in the day.
1904960	1905960	But not in America.
1905960	1907880	Not in America, no, that's true.
1907880	1912440	And looks pretty cool, kind of reminded me of some Panzer Dragon stuff on there.
1912440	1918600	So and then of course, WiiWare, right around the corner actually, Cave Story will be making
1918600	1926920	its way out on WiiWare March 22nd with slightly upgraded graphics, and looks kind of neat.
1926920	1932240	Also there's going to be some download content as well being available, including a new boss
1932240	1938560	rush and sanctuary time attack mode that will be available to download.
1938560	1943320	Huh, oh, I guess I take that back.
1943320	1944680	I misread that.
1944680	1948000	It was originally announced as download content, now it's being included.
1948000	1950760	So you get it for free.
1950760	1953520	Well extra stuff for free is always good.
1953520	1954520	Definitely.
1954520	1958880	So, any news that particularly got you excited at the Nintendo conference?
1958880	1964560	I know we've kind of touched on most of the stuff.
1964560	1972320	There was some other interesting stuff, like regarding Monster Hunter Tri, or I guess they're
1972320	1977680	calling it Monster Hunter Tri or whatever, but we'll talk a little bit more about that
1977680	1978680	later.
1978680	1979680	Gotcha.
1979680	1984920	I'm just, I was very interested to see that both Mario Galaxy and Metroid Other M are
1984920	1991040	coming out in the second quarter, which is really unheard of that they would put both
1991040	1994680	of those blockbuster games, because it's like, well crap, if you're putting out these two
1994680	1999560	games now, then what the hell do you have for, you know, holiday?
1999560	2000560	A new Zelda, OMG!
2000560	2002840	Oh yeah, it's pretty much a new Zelda game.
2002840	2005800	Well and then whatever they're going to show at E3 that might be the surprise, but that's
2005800	2009160	probably the Zelda game that's not much of a surprise at this point.
2009160	2013400	Remember, and I know I've said this on a show before, but New Super Mario Brothers Wii was
2013400	2017200	kept under wraps until E3, it was really the surprise.
2017200	2021760	Because remember the way that whole press conference went, like last year's E3 was supposed
2021760	2026920	to be kind of like this apology for the year before, and last year's E3, they came out
2026920	2031160	within five minutes, they were on New Super Mario Brothers Wii, and they're like, hey,
2031160	2035080	it's a New Super Mario Brothers game that looks and kind of plays like the old school
2035080	2039040	one, and this is what gamers want, dah dah dah, and guess what, it's out this holiday.
2039040	2040040	Woohoo!
2040040	2041800	And that was one of the big things they showed on the floor.
2041800	2047080	You know, I'm thinking there could be another like Gotcha this year from Nintendo, except
2047080	2050240	I worry it might be the Zelda game that's already kind of leaked out.
2050240	2054320	I'm guessing it's going to be like a Pikmin 3, probably the new Zelda game.
2054320	2058760	Wii Relax, which will be retarded, but it'll probably come out around October-ish, I think
2058760	2062320	around the same time as Wii Fit Plus did this year, and I think they'll probably treat it
2062320	2063320	as- Oh, the Vitality?
2063320	2067880	Yeah, I think they'll probably treat it as much, you know, like the Wii Fit Plus.
2067880	2075600	Not a lot of, I mean, probably not going to do as well as Wii Fit, you know, in general.
2075600	2080440	I just don't see the need for that little Vitality sensor, but whatever.
2080440	2086640	It would be really cool though, is to do like a new Zelda game, but like, you know, like
2086640	2091600	new Super Mario Brothers style, where it's old school Zelda, but like four player and
2091600	2092600	teaming up.
2092600	2093600	So, the four swords.
2093600	2094720	Something like that, yeah.
2094720	2097280	I want a lethargy sensor.
2097280	2100000	How about a Wii Vitality sensor that shocks you?
2100000	2101480	You're not moving!
2101480	2102480	Clear!
2102480	2103480	Fang!
2103480	2108280	Or just something like when you screw up in the game, it gives you a little bite of electricity
2108280	2109280	or something.
2109280	2110280	I don't know.
2110280	2111280	Could be fun.
2111280	2112280	Maybe a new Wario War game.
2112280	2116680	That could be, or the fanboy in me would love to see an F-Zero game come out of nowhere.
2116680	2117680	Oh god, that'd be awesome.
2117680	2121480	I'm not going to hold my breath though, but that would be the whoa crap game for me.
2121480	2124400	I'm still holding out for an Excite Truck 2.
2124400	2129840	You know, a real Excite Truck 2, not this Excite Bots bullshit.
2129840	2130840	Who knows?
2130840	2131840	Anything's possible.
2131840	2134840	Alright, well let's move on to some other platforms, obviously a big game going on right
2134840	2140560	now is Heavy Rain on the Playstation 3, which sadly I have not gotten my hands on yet amongst
2140560	2143440	all my real life stuff going on, but I do want to play it at some point, although I
2143440	2147240	heard, and this is kind of like breaking news as we're taping live on this Sunday, I heard
2147240	2151180	something about Playstation Network is down right now, I guess, and if you want to play
2151180	2153040	Heavy Rain, you can't.
2153040	2154740	Like I don't know how that works.
2154740	2157280	Does the game talk to the servers somehow?
2157280	2159600	Like you have to be online?
2159600	2164200	I don't see how it could because, you know, what if you don't have an internet connection
2164200	2167320	and you can't play the game?
2167320	2168320	I don't know.
2168320	2169320	Apparently something was going on.
2169320	2174640	I guess there's some game crashing errors going on on the PSN and it has something to
2174640	2179480	do with the dates reverting and now some of the data's corrupting or something.
2179480	2183560	And yeah, the issues are preventing folks from launching games like Heavy Rain, so it
2183560	2187440	sounds like the date or something might have got screwed up and now it's messing everyone
2187440	2188440	up.
2188440	2189440	I wonder how that works.
2189440	2190440	Yikes.
2190440	2192360	Well, hopefully that's fixed soon.
2192360	2196440	But meanwhile, Heavy Rain was banned in another country this week.
2196440	2198040	United Arab Emirates.
2198040	2199800	You will not be able to play Heavy Rain.
2199800	2201680	It's an official ban there.
2201680	2205160	So if you are in the Middle East and you want to play this game, you're going to have to
2205160	2211120	import it or something because the game was banned by the country's National Media Council.
2211120	2215400	Of course, Sony has come out and said, you know, the game is an 18 plus game.
2215400	2221080	It is strong content, but they didn't really respond to this particular ban.
2221080	2225600	So I have a feeling they might just cut their losses since unfortunately for anybody listening
2225600	2229920	who might be in the UAE, it's not one of Sony's biggest markets, so they might just be cutting
2229920	2232040	their losses and hoping you guys will import it.
2232040	2233800	I don't know.
2233800	2236760	But it wasn't banned because of the bugs.
2236760	2239080	Apparently there's some bugs going on in Heavy Rain.
2239080	2241300	It has to do with just some technical things.
2241300	2243680	Some audio is out of sync.
2243680	2245320	The game is freezing up.
2245320	2249500	There are some auto saves that turn out they can't load and for some reason everybody's
2249500	2251360	speaking French.
2251360	2255760	I'm just kidding about the last one sort of, but the rest, the rest is all, well, you've
2255760	2260300	heard about like how Heavy Rain was made in France and was developed by a French studio.
2260300	2263100	So they have all these French voice actors, but they're doing English and apparently the
2263100	2265320	accent is really noticeable.
2265320	2266320	Really noticeable.
2266320	2271080	The PlayStation network actually got hacked because on their website there is a directory
2271080	2275420	called Dear PlayStation that says get flash and or enable JavaScript and stop wasting
2275420	2277200	my time.
2277200	2278760	Interesting.
2278760	2280920	That's funny.
2280920	2281920	Yikes.
2281920	2286320	So PSN might be the victim of a hack going on right now.
2286320	2288480	So yeah, the game is locking up and so forth.
2288480	2293560	So I guess Sony has kind of posted in their forums about it saying that they are aware
2293560	2296900	of some of the issues and if you're having a particular issue, you should go to the thread
2296900	2301800	and post your information because you know, this is the era of patching video games that
2301800	2303800	are already broken.
2303800	2307320	Isn't Sony the same service that's running a show right now about finding a video game
2307320	2308320	tester?
2308320	2309320	I'm going to talk about this more in part B.
2309320	2310320	Yes, they are.
2310320	2314960	Sony might need some more video game testers right now, so maybe you all win.
2314960	2318000	Maybe everybody needs to win that show and go test Heavy Rain.
2318000	2319000	I don't know.
2319000	2321600	I will talk more about the tester in part B. I have a lot of thoughts on that, so we'll
2321600	2324040	get into that a little later on in the program.
2324040	2328600	But for now, more gaming news from Dark Soccer and then the release dates in a little bit.
2328600	2330320	Oh, release dates.
2330320	2331320	I'm looking forward.
2331320	2335440	But instead, this is not something that anyone should be looking forward to.
2335440	2338100	It's pretty, pretty bad.
2338100	2345800	There are 12 game stores, as in a big retailer in the UK.
2345800	2351440	Actually more than that, 43 are going to be closing down in the UK.
2351440	2356120	That means that 247 people are going to be laid off.
2356120	2363840	Or as the article says, will be a redundant, which I think is a horrible term.
2363840	2365240	Also...
2365240	2367160	Well that's what they call it over there though, redundancies, right?
2367160	2368160	I know.
2368160	2369160	I just think it's awful.
2369160	2370520	It's just a terrible word.
2370520	2375640	You know, hi, you're redundant, okay?
2375640	2379920	Whose fault is that for creating a redundant position?
2379920	2381720	The same guy who's probably laying me off.
2381720	2388080	Well that's going to be a third of the stores out of a total of 682.
2388080	2395280	So it's including 12 game stores and 6 game station outlets and 25 Debenham's stores.
2395280	2397160	The little concessions.
2397160	2402960	And just so folks not in the UK know, the store is actually called Game.
2402960	2405560	So when you say a game store, you're not being vague.
2405560	2406560	It's actually G-A-M-E.
2406560	2407560	All caps.
2407560	2410560	All caps, trademark, restricted.
2410560	2413480	Would you say, and I'm not familiar, would you say, Jamie, that's kind of like their
2413480	2414480	version of GameStop?
2414480	2416440	Like that's their big, big industry there?
2416440	2417960	I'd say it's a big one.
2417960	2418960	That would be...
2418960	2421760	Can you imagine if like a bunch of GameStops here shut down?
2421760	2425160	Although I guess what we've had the news about GameCrazy and some of the competitors.
2425160	2426160	Don't get me started on that, please.
2426160	2427320	I know, I'm sorry.
2427320	2428320	But you know, it's...
2428320	2429920	A bunch of GameStops closed?
2429920	2435320	Wow, then there'd be an adequate number of GameStops available because right now there's
2435320	2436320	way too many.
2436320	2439600	Yeah, they're totally cornering the market, which I think is disgusting.
2439600	2441560	Don't we have antitrust laws and stuff in this?
2441560	2442560	Yeah, we do.
2442560	2443560	But Google's not listening.
2443560	2444560	I mean, GameStop's not listening.
2444560	2445560	Did I say Google?
2445560	2446560	Yeah, you said Google.
2446560	2447560	Yeah, well Google's on the list too.
2447560	2449560	Google's always listening.
2449560	2453760	Now, Google's just been on a decline in the past couple of years.
2453760	2454760	Like I'm a big Google...
2454760	2456640	Google's being sued for violation of antitrust.
2456640	2461760	Well, you know, I'm a big Google fan, but I'm sorry, Wave was what?
2461760	2463720	We don't need Google Mars.
2463720	2464720	And Buzz was bad.
2464720	2465720	Did you know about that?
2465720	2466720	Did you know about Google Mars?
2466720	2467720	Google Mars.
2467720	2468720	That's the maps on Mars, right?
2468720	2469720	Yes.
2469720	2470720	I think that's cool.
2470720	2471720	It's cool, but it doesn't look very good.
2471720	2472720	And why do we need to...
2472720	2475600	Can't we just go to NASA's website or something?
2475600	2477480	I'm okay with Google Mars.
2477480	2479320	You know, it's Earth in the style...
2479320	2481520	But it's Mars in the style of Google Earth.
2481520	2482520	I'm okay with that.
2482520	2483520	What about Google Veronica Mars?
2483520	2484520	Buzz!
2484520	2485520	Google Veronica Mars would be cool.
2485520	2486520	I don't need that for that.
2486520	2488960	Buzz was bad.
2488960	2490280	Buzz was a bad idea.
2490280	2491280	What was Buzz?
2491280	2492280	I didn't hear about that.
2492280	2497520	It was their response to Twitter, but the problem was it automatically added the 40
2497520	2502080	most common people you email to your Buzz friends list, and if somebody went to your
2502080	2505760	public profile, they could see the 40 people you email the most.
2505760	2511760	So if one of them happens to be like an ex, or, you know, a boss is emailing his secretary
2511760	2514000	on a personal email, everybody could see that.
2514000	2515000	Or a porn finder.
2515000	2516000	Exactly.
2516000	2522360	Like, whoever thought that was a good idea needs to be made redundant.
2522360	2523360	Honestly.
2523360	2526040	Well, if they were going to do something like that, they should have it as an option that
2526040	2527040	you could select.
2527040	2528040	It's ridiculous.
2528040	2532040	Well, now they backtracked, but they botched the launch of that thing, and now nobody's
2532040	2533040	going to trust it.
2533040	2537400	So they might as well just nuke Buzz, nuke Wave, and start again.
2537400	2538400	Google Buzz Wave.
2538400	2540440	I am sick of the social networking, by the way.
2540440	2542720	It's like I was posting on my Facebook earlier.
2542720	2545760	I'm sick of social networking, yet I'm compelled to still do it.
2545760	2546760	I am, too.
2546760	2549800	You know, Tangent Train, choo choo.
2549800	2550800	Okay.
2550800	2557440	There's this whole email that came out this week from Bizarre Creations, who's a studio
2557440	2558440	I really respect.
2558440	2559440	They're great.
2559440	2560440	They make a lot of great stuff.
2560440	2562340	And I'm really looking forward to Blur.
2562340	2565560	Just as a gamer, that was one of the fun games I played at E3.
2565560	2570720	But they were talking about how they have fully integrated Twitter into Blur, and how
2570720	2574520	you can actually tweet while driving in Blur.
2574520	2578760	And not just necessarily making, and I apologize because I don't have the press release in
2578760	2582480	front of me, so I hope I'm not misstating anything, but I believe it was so far as,
2582480	2587920	you can hit the left bumper, and you can automatically send to your Twitter what you are doing in
2587920	2588920	Blur.
2588920	2590580	That's just ridiculous.
2590580	2593960	And I'm just thinking, okay, I get what they're trying to do.
2593960	2598560	Like here at OLR, we try to embrace all social networking when it comes out, because we want
2598560	2601920	to be where every gamer has a voice, and we want people to interact with us.
2601920	2605680	And I get that Bizzare is trying to be on the cutting edge.
2605680	2607760	So for that, I say, okay, cool.
2607760	2610880	But there's the other part of me that goes, God, as if Twitter didn't have enough bullshit
2610880	2611880	on it already.
2611880	2615440	Like, honestly, guys, I'm just straight up with this whole social networking thing.
2615440	2616760	And I've told people this.
2616760	2621840	If you post important news about your life on Facebook, and are going to give me a pop
2621840	2626640	quiz on it later, or expect me to know that like you are getting engaged because the only
2626640	2629840	place you said anything was Facebook, I'm sorry.
2629840	2630840	That doesn't fly with me.
2630840	2636360	Like, if you want me to know what's going on with you, text, email, you know, I like
2636360	2640300	to think those are kind of modern things or call, pick up the phone, dial the numbers
2640300	2641520	and call.
2641520	2642520	You know what?
2642520	2643520	I have to read this list.
2643520	2650280	And as a poster that was done by the oatmeal, the 10 things you need to stop tweeting about.
2650280	2651280	Have you seen that Rob?
2651280	2652280	No, I have not.
2652280	2653680	One, what are you eating?
2653680	2658120	I had meatloaf for breakfast, lol please RT.
2658120	2662400	Social media, the conference or event that you're at.
2662400	2663400	Twitter itself.
2663400	2667360	Well, now wait a minute though, because Twitter, like we did the tweet thing for me three and
2667360	2670440	I think a lot of people like that because we were pictures in the, that was reporting
2670440	2671660	news.
2671660	2677840	This example is using, it's like a total, so and so totally owned that last session
2677840	2679720	on optimizing your Twitter background pic.
2679720	2680720	I get what you're saying.
2680720	2681720	You know what?
2681720	2683760	There's a girl on my friends list and I love her to death.
2683760	2690000	I think she's amazing, but she posts so many updates whenever she's at like a concert for
2690000	2695220	a former American Idol or something like it just fills up my page and I can't see anybody
2695220	2700400	else's list and I'm kind of just thinking like, can you post a live journal or somewhere
2700400	2701400	where you can make long posts?
2701400	2706000	The other one on here is your workout, your kid, dog, cat, goat or whatever else.
2706000	2710940	Speaking out of context, as in people who just say nonsense, daily booth photos, emotional
2710940	2715880	breakthroughs and the number of like posting the daily picture of yourself.
2715880	2719280	Oh, like where it's the same picture of me every day flexing and looking cute.
2719280	2720280	Yeah.
2720280	2721280	Okay.
2721280	2722280	Emotional breakthroughs and the number of followers you have.
2722280	2723280	Oh yeah.
2723280	2727680	That's, and that's, that's so tacky when somebody posts like, I have a thousand followers.
2727680	2731000	Well, I'll have to tell you, now you don't.
2731000	2732800	Now you have nine 99 click.
2732800	2738040	I have to tell you the, what, what hit me today and I actually, I use Twitter now for
2738040	2741120	more of a professional networking.
2741120	2743460	I follow a lot of other designers.
2743460	2747880	I follow people in the comic book industry and I actually get something out of, you know,
2747880	2752320	and yeah, it's not that I don't care about the people on Twitter.
2752320	2753440	You know what I mean?
2753440	2757980	It's just that I really don't need to know how big of a poop you took or I, you know,
2757980	2762080	I'm sure your baby is cute, but I would rather have something meaningful.
2762080	2765920	I honestly, I feel like the biggest hypocrite when it comes to Twitter because most of the
2765920	2770200	stuff I tweet these days have to do with video games and I kind of use it like for OLR related
2770200	2772920	things and to keep tabs on the OLR fans.
2772920	2775440	But I, I don't like reading that stuff.
2775440	2779480	Like when I look at my fans list and it's, it's like a bunch of other podcasters promoting
2779480	2780480	their shows.
2780480	2781820	I'm like, yeah, okay, I know you have a show.
2781820	2782820	I get it.
2782820	2787980	But as in here I am tweeting, Hey, listen to OLR tonight, you know, Twitter makes me
2787980	2788980	feel dirty.
2788980	2792400	Well, let's just say, you know, we, we have problems with it yet.
2792400	2794800	We feel compelled to use it, right?
2794800	2798960	Because it is now a part of our culture.
2798960	2804320	If you think about it, it's really, uh, why it's not cool anymore.
2804320	2809980	In Facebook, I have a little bit more love for because I use that as my mini blog.
2809980	2813320	That's actually, I go back and check on it cause I usually just put my to do list up
2813320	2814320	there.
2814320	2816000	Like what do I need to get done today and refer back to it.
2816000	2819360	But I've actually not even been, you know, I'm actually making a conscious effort not
2819360	2823640	to use either of them so much and actually keep a notebook with me and use my live journal
2823640	2824960	and my blog.
2824960	2829960	Well the thing that freaks me out is that like CNN uses Twitter as like a real source
2829960	2830960	now.
2830960	2832800	And that kind of weirds me out a little bit.
2832800	2838160	Like when, when boner died this week, right here, the celebrity from, he was boner on
2838160	2839160	growing pains.
2839160	2840160	Chekhov's kid.
2840160	2841160	Yeah.
2841160	2842160	Oh yeah.
2842160	2843160	Chekhov's kid.
2843160	2845680	Um, you know, unfortunately very tragic, sad, you know, what have you.
2845680	2852880	But CNN went to Twitter to see what all the other celebrities who knew him like Kirk Cameron
2852880	2856800	and you know, the people that would have worked with him before were saying about him.
2856800	2860160	And I don't know, like I just, I read the story and I just kind of thought whatever
2860160	2865860	happened to like, he's um, he does a lot of Jesus stuff.
2865860	2870460	Like you would find his works at the Bible houses and yeah, those types of places.
2870460	2876120	But anyway, uh, he was in the, um, movie for, uh, left behind, left behind.
2876120	2877600	I keep thinking left for dead.
2877600	2878600	No, not that movie.
2878600	2879600	That's a different movie.
2879600	2880600	Left behind.
2880600	2881600	That's it.
2881600	2882600	The rapture movie.
2882600	2883600	Yeah.
2883600	2888000	But my whole thing is that CNN is running this report about what all the celebs on Twitter
2888000	2892600	are saying and I can't help but think like whatever happened to actual reporting?
2892600	2893600	I know.
2893600	2894600	Well, this is, this is my thought.
2894600	2896680	Like I can use Google and Twitter.
2896680	2902180	Is it when they're doing editorials and when it get like a viewer feedback?
2902180	2903180	That's a good thing.
2903180	2906540	You know, the same reason why we have the chat room, you know, when we talk about an
2906540	2910240	actual story and we want to see what people think about it, it's, I think, look at it
2910240	2914700	as that equivalent, but in, it's a fine line.
2914700	2919920	It's a really fine line and you know, that's why I think there's legitimate uses for it.
2919920	2923960	I think, you know, a lot of people honestly are using it to validate themselves.
2923960	2929160	Whereas, you know, if, if you want to share something important with people, it's a good
2929160	2930160	way to do it.
2930160	2933680	If you want to see what other people are doing in your industry, it's a good thing to find
2933680	2935700	out other people that are in your industry.
2935700	2941280	But I'm really just getting like a, like so tired of the, Oh, I had to poop today.
2941280	2942280	Yeah.
2942280	2943280	Yeah.
2943280	2946400	Nobody's going to retweet you and then say, I'm so glad your colon is working properly.
2946400	2949200	You know, some people do reply to that.
2949200	2951540	Don't, don't get me started.
2951540	2956320	And yeah, I've, I've posted really inane stuff on there too, but I actually just, uh, detached
2956320	2964240	my, uh, loud Twitter feed from my live journal and I, cause of the, whatever, yay.
2964240	2967320	Last thing I hate most about Twitter is that it's invading live journal.
2967320	2968320	Yay.
2968320	2969320	Gold star for Jamie.
2969320	2970360	I'm so happy.
2970360	2974560	Over the last few weeks, I would just go back and check my loud Twitter feed and like I
2974560	2978840	posted one thing, why?
2978840	2983080	I just now do it to keep up with other people, you know, or if I have something to announce,
2983080	2988320	like that's important, like come to my birthday party or I'm going to be going to LA.
2988320	2990120	I would like to meet up with my friends there.
2990120	2991680	That type of thing.
2991680	2996360	That's a little bit more reasonable instead of, Oh, um, I had some, uh, we'd a Bix for
2996360	2997360	breakfast.
2997360	2998360	Yeah.
2998360	2999360	I don't know.
2999360	3002000	I know we're on this big tangent with social networking, but it's just, it's, we're in
3002000	3005520	a weird place right now where it's, it's kind of like the honeymoon phase is over with the
3005520	3006520	Twitter and the Facebook.
3006520	3010360	And now it's like, okay, I'm linking this poster to the chat room.
3010360	3012600	If you have some thoughts, why not email them to us?
3012600	3016560	Mailbag orange launch radio.com or we'll probably get some phone calls on it later in the show
3016560	3019960	for now though, we want to get to the classic game of the week, but not before we do release
3019960	3021600	dates and a couple more news stories.
3021600	3024760	So let's travel around the world and see what's coming out in the various countries.
3024760	3025760	Loki.
3025760	3026760	Yes.
3026760	3027760	Um, this week there's actually some pretty good stuff coming out.
3027760	3032920	Uh, sins of a solar empire Trinity actually, uh, coming out this week as well.
3032920	3038040	Uh, Dante's Inferno make his way out on PSP was a little delayed from the other games
3038040	3039040	finals month.
3039040	3044660	Uh, Alison Wonderland, they have that coming out in DS and on the, we, the we version being
3044660	3050400	more like the movie, the DS version being more like Beetlejuice, the cartoon, at least
3050400	3052960	that's what it looks like in the picture.
3052960	3061680	Um, lunar silver, silver star harmony limited edition coming out on PSP deck of sports on
3061680	3068280	the DS this week, sponge Bob's boating bash coming out on the Nintendo DS and on the week
3068280	3071160	kind of a demolition Derby type of game.
3071160	3080180	MLB two K 10 coming out on PlayStation two PS three X-Box three 60 we DS and PSP also
3080180	3086560	coming out from Sony MLB 10 the show, which is on all Sony platforms, PS two, PS three
3086560	3088200	and PSP.
3088200	3097000	Um, battle of giants, mutant insects, kind of a little fighting game from Ubisoft, uh,
3097000	3102000	battlefield bad company two coming out on PlayStation three X-Box three 60 and PC this
3102000	3109440	week silent hunter five battle of the Atlantic coming out on PC.
3109440	3114880	Supreme commander two coming out from square Enix on PC as well.
3114880	3122720	And lips party classics coming out on X-Box three 60 and that is it.
3122720	3126600	I saw a new commercial for lips this week that I guess uses Lily Allen sort of as the
3126600	3128160	centerpiece of it.
3128160	3129160	Yeah.
3129160	3130720	I wasn't that impressed.
3130720	3132200	I don't know.
3132200	3137240	I guess I'm, maybe I'm just, I'm surprised anybody buys lips to be honest.
3137240	3138240	Well I buy sink star.
3138240	3142640	I mean, yeah, but I understand seeing star cause there's an actual following for that,
3142640	3143880	but lips is not so much.
3143880	3146000	It's like they're trying to keep putting game.
3146000	3149040	I think lips was kind of put out as a response to sing star.
3149040	3152720	You know, if lips had come first, I probably would have been on the lips.
3152720	3155480	It's just seeing star seems to be easier to use.
3155480	3158000	Well seeing star also has like the real, well I guess lips does too.
3158000	3159000	I don't know.
3159000	3162000	I know seeing star like it just has all the real videos integrated and you know, it's
3162000	3164100	a really great party game, but it does too.
3164100	3168440	But the thing I thought with lips was it was supposed to be able to integrate any music
3168440	3172480	that you had in kind of turned into a karaoke version, but.
3172480	3173480	I believe it does.
3173480	3174480	It's just kind of wonky.
3174480	3179180	It's not the greatest implementation, you know, it's basically using one of those.
3179180	3183440	You can use a filter in like Adobe audition to take out vocals too, but it's, it's a little
3183440	3184440	hit and miss.
3184440	3188240	There's even some MP3 plugins that do that for Winamp, but it's a little hit and miss
3188240	3191920	cause it's just looking, I don't know how the science of it works, but it looks at a
3191920	3195960	certain component of the track of the song and kind of removes it and sometimes it works
3195960	3197960	and sometimes it doesn't.
3197960	3198960	Oh well.
3198960	3204520	Anyhow, moving on to the Xbox 360 in Japan and looking at Japanese release dates.
3204520	3210240	Bioshock 2 comes out this week on March 4th as well as Nobunaga no Yabutendo comes out
3210240	3213360	and I believe that was on the PS3 a couple weeks ago cause I seem to remember talking
3213360	3214360	about that game before.
3214360	3218880	But yeah, localized version of Bioshock 2 also on the 360 this week in Japan.
3218880	3223880	Moving on to the PlayStation 3, no there's Nobunaga no Yabutendo again, so maybe it was
3223880	3225480	pushed back a little, I don't know.
3225480	3230440	But there it is on the PlayStation 3, also Bioshock 2 on the PlayStation 3 as well.
3230440	3233020	Maybe this is actually, you know what this is, no this is different.
3233020	3236660	This is not the Dynasty Warriors, this actually looks like Nobunaga's Ambition.
3236660	3238920	This looks like a next gen version of it.
3238920	3242520	You know, I can't read the Japanese, but just looking at the interface, it looks like they're
3242520	3245500	picking the different city layouts and so forth.
3245500	3251360	So if you know the Nobunaga Ambition series of games, I don't know how to explain it in
3251360	3252360	a nutshell.
3252360	3257920	It's basically an RTS-ish kind of game that's about Japanese feudalism, I guess is the easiest
3257920	3259240	way for me to sum it up.
3259240	3260800	It's a feudal Japan sim.
3260800	3265560	I liked the old school one on the NES, but boy that game's evolved quickly over time.
3265560	3270360	That one on PlayStation 2 a few years back, that was the last one I remembered that came
3270360	3271360	out over here.
3271360	3272360	Oh there's a new one coming out.
3272360	3276440	On the Nintendo Wii, nothing this week believe it or not, but next week Taiko no Tatsujin,
3276440	3279800	I know our music game fans might be familiar with that one, Taiko no Tatsujin makes its
3279800	3282320	way to the Wii next week, and that's March 11th, not this week.
3282320	3283320	Is that another one?
3283320	3284320	Like a sequel?
3284320	3285320	Because I thought they had one over there already.
3285320	3287960	I thought they had one there already too, but this must be, uh...
3287960	3290200	Is this the one with the inflatable drum?
3290200	3291900	I believe it is.
3291900	3296560	Or this could also be a price reduction, or it could be the game, because yeah, they're
3296560	3297560	only...
3297560	3305680	I think this is maybe the game by itself without the drum, is probably what it is.
3305680	3309200	On the PlayStation 2 this week, nothing, again nothing.
3309200	3313440	On the Nintendo DS though, a lot of Dragon Quest games are going into the Ultimate Hits
3313440	3320920	collection, that would be 4, 9, and 5 all get price reductions from Squeenix as well
3320920	3324880	as Final Fantasy 4, so it's a big week for price reductions.
3324880	3331080	Otherwise, there is Bomberman Touchland, Star Bomber No Miracle World gets a price reduction
3331080	3335640	as well, and probably a big, big release this week in Japan, which is why everything else
3335640	3342040	is kind of limited this week, Pokemon Ranger, Hikari no Kiseki comes out this week.
3342040	3349560	This is different, this is not like the gold and silver in those games, but yeah, it's
3349560	3350560	a new Pokemon game.
3350560	3351560	I think that's what that means.
3351560	3355880	Here's the little description here, the Pokemon nappers are catching Pokemon and involving
3355880	3364800	them in shady activities, there are more than 300 species of Pokeporns, most of them you've
3364800	3368960	seen in HeartGold and Silver, and then you tame them and you can get them to join you
3368960	3372520	in battle, but it's not, like I'm just looking at the screenshots, it's not the same type
3372520	3377680	of game as the other games, this looks a little more action-y, actually, for some reason.
3377680	3379000	Like a tactics game?
3379000	3384320	No, it looks like it's almost like mini-games, see how it's kind of like first person, flight
3384320	3388440	type of game there, and then this one looks like some type of running, this one looks
3388440	3391520	like they're drawing on the DS screen.
3391520	3396200	It looks like it's almost like a mix of mini-games and Pokemon or something.
3396200	3399320	So there you go.
3399320	3406760	Lastly on the PSP,.hack//Link comes out on the PSP, that's another big release, so check
3406760	3407760	that out.
3407760	3412640	If you're a fan of the.hack// series, the PSP gets a new.hack// game this week.
3412640	3417600	They call it the grand finale you've all been waiting for.
3417600	3418600	Good luck.
3418600	3421560	Let's move to the UK, DarkSakura.
3421560	3423560	I'd like to.
3423560	3424560	Can we move there?
3424560	3427240	Um, no, I can't afford it.
3427240	3428240	Damn, okay.
3428240	3434720	Well, on the 3rd of March we have Toy Soldiers, on the 5th we have Alice in Wonderland, and
3434720	3441760	then Assassin's Creed 2 for PC, Battlefield Bad Company 2, BlazBlue Calamity Trigger,
3441760	3449840	Dementium 2 on the DS, Picross 3D, Silent Hunter 5 by Ubisoft, and Supreme Hunter 2,
3449840	3455040	and Sushi Go Round for the DS and the Wii.
3455040	3456040	Sushi.
3456040	3458040	Yay, Sushi.
3458040	3461560	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys and then we're going to get into the
3461560	3464840	classic game of the week and I'll just give you a little hint.
3464840	3467920	I'm not going to give away what DarkSakura's picked, I'm just going to say it's really
3467920	3468920	old.
3468920	3472760	But that's not a bad thing.
3472760	3474760	Oh yeah.
3474760	3481640	So apparently Activision is being sued for false patent marketing and what that is is
3481640	3489060	basically that Activision is filing patents for its products that are beyond the scope
3489060	3493760	of what it's producing, for example.
3493760	3502280	There's patent 753, which is basically a DDR pad, which wouldn't necessarily apply to Guitar
3502280	3508920	Hero, which is what it's under, or 689, which is a DJ Hero turntable, which doesn't really
3508920	3514280	work with Guitar Hero 5 or Band Hero.
3514280	3520880	Apparently they're just putting out patents for different things in C16.
3520880	3526320	And this is, the group behind this is a patent compliance group.
3526320	3531420	They're seeking, this is almost to the point where it's retarded, they're seeking $500
3531420	3534280	for each Activision violation.
3534280	3539280	$500, really.
3539280	3546920	So but apparently they're also targeting other companies as well.
3546920	3549040	Just Activision happens to be one of those.
3549040	3558960	And according to Mark Mathenitis, the question is one that actually penalizes false marking
3558960	3561800	that a product is patented or patent pending.
3561800	3566560	The idea that those false markings might deter someone from trying to create something new
3566560	3568400	in that area.
3568400	3575120	So basically, hey look, we have a patent for a DDR controller, you can't make any dance
3575120	3576120	games.
3576120	3578120	It's like they're calling dibs on everything.
3578120	3580760	Dibs on this, dibs on this, dibs on this, and then they don't do anything with it.
3580760	3584280	And we're going to get into another story a little later on tonight about something
3584280	3586720	that they're like, nope, nope, can't have it, it's ours.
3586720	3592240	And they're not going to do anything with it.
3592240	3596600	As much as a silly lawsuit as this sounds, I'm glad someone's calling them on it because
3596600	3598580	now Activision is going to have to respond to this.
3598580	3601840	Has Activision made a response to this?
3601840	3608080	They haven't made a response yet, but at the same time, I don't see how they can, you know,
3608080	3611880	patent a DDR pad when a DDR pad's already been made, you know what I mean?
3611880	3615460	It's like, you can't patent something that already exists.
3615460	3617960	You can't say, hey look, I invented the rock.
3617960	3621640	Now you all owe me money because you have rocks.
3621640	3625040	Well maybe they changed a couple of little things here.
3625040	3626560	That's how it works.
3626560	3629680	One law in this country is really weird, really weird.
3629680	3634120	They change one or two things and claim it that they invented the genre, yeah.
3634120	3635120	We know how that works.
3635120	3636680	Yeah, right.
3636680	3639640	So we'll see what comes forth of that.
3639640	3642840	I'm really looking forward to what Activision has to say about that.
3642840	3645760	Remember when Activision was like the best game company in the world because they made
3645760	3649840	games like Pitfall and Kaboom and Keystone Capers?
3649840	3652080	Then Bobby Kotick came along.
3652080	3653880	His days are numbered, I'm telling you.
3653880	3657680	His days are numbered because he looks, just lately in the past couple of years he's come
3657680	3664320	out and looked like a buffoon and nobody likes, nobody likes their CEO to be a douche.
3664320	3667320	Hey, how about something for free?
3667320	3668320	Free games.
3668320	3671460	Now this is the way to do business, Activision Take Notes.
3671460	3672460	Free games.
3672460	3674480	Actually I'll tell you even better than that, Dark Sakura.
3674480	3675860	Free Pagle.
3675860	3676860	That's right.
3676860	3677860	Free Pagle.
3677860	3678860	Crack.
3678860	3682120	There is a promotion going on right now where you can get Pagle Knights for yourself or
3682120	3685440	a loved one, family member, or even an enemy if you want, I don't care.
3685440	3691280	All you have to do, you sign up for PopCap's newsletter by going to popcap.com.
3691280	3694960	By the way, of course, that means they're going to spam your email with all the newsletters,
3694960	3698260	but hey, I don't know about you, I have an email just set up for spam.
3698260	3701000	So to sign up for different websites, bug me not.
3701000	3702680	So yeah, there you go.
3702680	3707400	There's also websites with disposable email addresses that'll last for about ten minutes,
3707400	3711920	enough time for them to send you back your confirmation code and then poof, it's gone.
3711920	3712920	Nice.
3712920	3717240	I always liked the idea of setting up my own domain.
3717240	3721280	I had a friend that did this, had his own domain that he set up for email addresses.
3721280	3725480	And what he would do is when he would sign up for websites, he would create a new email
3725480	3732760	account on his domain that was like, you know, whatever his name was, we'll say, uh, john.
3732760	3735440	And then whatever the name of the site was that he was signing up for.
3735440	3739040	So when all the spam emails started coming in, he would know exactly what site was doing
3739040	3742960	it because he custom made email addresses for every website he signed up for.
3742960	3743960	I think that's a great idea.
3743960	3748520	Of course, I don't know if he posted those results anywhere, but he should.
3748520	3751960	So I think I'd like to know what websites are selling my email address.
3751960	3754040	I'll kick their butt.
3754040	3756160	Question from our chat room.
3756160	3760160	Uh, Kossin, and I apologize if I'm saying that wrong, but Kossin says, what's the disposable
3760160	3761560	email site called?
3761560	3764840	I don't remember, but I saw it in 2600 Magazine a while back.
3764840	3769200	Apparently if there's a few of them, because gold anthro follows up with disposable.com
3769200	3774080	and RoboKun says meltmail.com disposable, I think is the one I was thinking of.
3774080	3776080	And Toa Gak just simply says there are lots of them.
3776080	3779800	So there's a few of them out there wherever they can stick a banner ad.
3779800	3781280	That's that's what they're going to do.
3781280	3784960	All right, we're going to get into a segment here on the show that we love to do every
3784960	3785960	week.
3785960	3789280	It's the classic game of the week.
3789280	3793040	And during the classic game of the week, we encourage dark soccer to dive into the vault
3793040	3798640	of classic gaming and find a game that she says, you know what, kids and adults too,
3798640	3803360	you should be playing this game this week because it's a it's a classic game.
3803360	3805480	And if you're not playing this, you're a buffoon.
3805480	3806480	Yeah.
3806480	3807480	Dark soccer.
3807480	3808480	But phone.
3808480	3810540	So what should the non buffoons be playing this week?
3810540	3816640	The game is venture from 1981 Wow, that's old.
3816640	3817640	Yeah, that's older than most.
3817640	3820520	I was five when this game came out.
3820520	3823160	So since this is such an old game, there's not a lot of music.
3823160	3826680	But let's play there's actually plenty of music in this one with some ambient noises
3826680	3827680	and stuff.
3827680	3828680	No, it's a lot of music.
3828680	3829680	Listen.
3829680	3839400	The one posted here is actually the clique of vision version specifically, because I
3839400	3843040	played a crap ton of this on clique of vision.
3843040	3848640	But the game is where you're this little guy named Winky who looks like kind of a sperm.
3848640	3855040	I mean, kind of like a yeah, whatever he's this little blob with a bow and arrow.
3855040	3859360	And he walks around this hall where these big things that I used to call them boogers
3859360	3863580	when I when I was playing this as a kid.
3863580	3867080	But they're just these tentacled hall monsters.
3867080	3868080	You can't kill them.
3868080	3869220	You can't stop them.
3869220	3872360	They're just completely invulnerable.
3872360	3879920	And with with that, you actually have to go into these four or five rooms per area and
3879920	3883680	then get the treasure that's in each room while you're shooting and avoiding the little
3883680	3884680	creatures inside.
3884680	3888400	And each one has their own theme.
3888400	3893960	If you touch one of the monsters, it's called you're getting carrioned.
3893960	3898720	Which I thought, like, you hear that noise?
3898720	3901640	That's when one of the when you've been hanging out in the room too long and the hall monster
3901640	3902640	comes after you.
3902640	3903640	I see.
3903640	3907040	Or I guess now that I'm a little bit older, I can call it Cthulhu face.
3907040	3911460	But you can you can do a little bit of dodging here and there.
3911460	3916920	You can and the thing is that you can't run into the corpses of the things that you shoot
3916920	3919380	or they'll kill you too.
3919380	3923720	And they'll block your path until they fade from the screen.
3923720	3925720	And you've got different types of dungeons.
3925720	3928320	You cannot touch a corpse because they're smelly.
3928320	3930400	You'll get carrioned.
3930400	3933760	In level one you've got the wall room, the serpent room, the skeleton room, the goblin
3933760	3934760	room.
3934760	3938240	In level two you have the two-headed room, the dragon room, the spider room, the troll
3938240	3939240	room.
3939240	3940240	I can tell you the dragon room was pain in the ass.
3940240	3947040	Level three you have the genie room, the demon room, the cyclops room, and the bat room.
3947040	3948500	But I freaking love this game.
3948500	3952020	This is kind of weird because I noticed that, like, you know, especially for being such
3952020	3957240	an old game, like you have this screen that's like zoomed out showing all the different
3957240	3959600	rooms and then you kind of like go into one room.
3959600	3960600	That's the dragon room, by the way.
3960600	3961600	That's interesting.
3961600	3962600	Pain in the ass.
3962600	3971480	But now this is one of those games, keep in mind, I had a clique-o-vision for a long time.
3971480	3976360	Like I remember MTV coming out and me having a clique-o-vision.
3976360	3980960	I remember those in a span of, you know, when I lived in the same house.
3980960	3983440	I'll put it that way.
3983440	3990320	And this was, my mother used to play a lot of this.
3990320	3991880	Actually my mom's favorite game was Space Fury.
3991880	3992880	Do you remember that?
3992880	3995000	No, because I didn't have a clique-o-vision.
3995000	3999600	Space Fury was kind of like an asteroids kind of game.
3999600	4003200	And this is the type of stuff that I bet is coming to Microsoft's game room.
4003200	4007080	When they talk about like a thousand classic games, you're going to see somebody digging
4007080	4010880	into the back catalog of a lot of the old systems like clique-o-vision and Atari.
4010880	4013480	I could probably make this in Flash now.
4013480	4016840	I mean, seriously, I probably know enough Flash now to make this game.
4016840	4018800	I'm sure there's clones out there.
4018800	4024240	Oh yeah, but honestly it was, this was seriously one of my favorite games when I was a little
4024240	4025240	kid.
4025240	4029640	And I love the little dinky music, I'd go around humming this one to myself when I was
4029640	4030640	a kid.
4030640	4036320	But I mean, you know, the games that I had at the time, I had like Mouse Trap and Carnival.
4036320	4038100	But this one got tons of play.
4038100	4041800	This one and Turbo, but...
4041800	4042800	Alright.
4042800	4046980	And it actually had pretty good music for when it came out.
4046980	4049120	For 81, yeah.
4049120	4052400	So there you go, your classic video game of the week, Venture.
4052400	4056520	It was an arcade game too, but I guess Dark Psycho is really referencing the clique-o-vision
4056520	4057520	one.
4057520	4058520	Was the arcade version really different?
4058520	4060640	No, not really.
4060640	4066560	The clique-o-version, clique-o-vision, clique-o-vision one I think came out in 82?
4066560	4067720	Here's some from the arcade version.
4067720	4070680	I just noticed this related little video here, I just kind of want to take a peek and see
4070680	4071680	how it's different.
4071680	4075720	Oh yeah, it's very similar looking, like almost like it's done on the same hardware or something.
4075720	4078080	Except, you know, there's a little bit more animation.
4078080	4079080	Yeah.
4079080	4083880	Oh yeah, when you go in the rooms, it like zooms in.
4083880	4084880	Interesting.
4084880	4088360	But it had the same gameplay.
4088360	4089360	Yeah.
4089360	4091360	That's kind of interesting.
4091360	4092360	Oops, sorry.
4092360	4093360	Alright.
4093360	4097480	But honestly, for me, it was all about, I mean, you know, the rooms are all the same.
4097480	4102920	It's just, they zoom in and out, you know, but this was totally like my game.
4102920	4103920	Alright.
4103920	4107000	Venturi, oh this one has the corpses kind of rotting away.
4107000	4108000	Yeah.
4108000	4112440	I mean, like I said, a little bit more animation, you know, but, oh and the snot monsters were
4112440	4113440	red.
4113440	4116360	But still, it's the same game.
4116360	4122000	The clique-o-vision version is probably, for its time, the best translation of that game
4122000	4123000	that there was.
4123000	4124000	Which came first?
4124000	4125000	Venture or adventure?
4125000	4126000	Because...
4126000	4127000	I think venture came first.
4127000	4128000	Did it really?
4128000	4130720	I just, you know, my timeline from back then is not that great.
4130720	4131720	Let me check.
4131720	4132720	Let me check.
4132720	4134880	Yeah, look that up real quick, because I'm curious.
4134880	4138640	Because there are some similarities of sorts between the two, and I've seen comparisons
4138640	4140800	to Berserk as well, because...
4140800	4145520	Yeah, it actually, the hall monsters are actually sort of like the evil Otto from Berserk.
4145520	4148600	Which is the bouncing happy face, if anyone's actually played that.
4148600	4150600	Good stuff.
4150600	4153040	Um, I can't find adventure.
4153040	4154040	Oh well.
4154040	4157440	Oh no, maybe actually spelling it right would be nice?
4157440	4160000	That would help in trying to do your research.
4160000	4161000	Absolutely.
4161000	4162000	Yeah.
4162000	4163000	Okay.
4163000	4170120	No, adventure was, uh, well there was a Sierra one in 1979.
4170120	4171120	So yeah.
4171120	4172120	Hmm.
4172120	4173760	There's different games that were named adventure.
4173760	4174760	So.
4174760	4175760	Interesting.
4175760	4179800	Alright, well we're gonna take a quick break here at Orange Lounge Radio, but fear not,
4179800	4182080	we'll be back with more in tonight's Part B.
4182080	4183960	So stick around folks.
4183960	4189360	We'll be right back in just a minute with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4189360	4193160	And for those of you guys listening live tonight, we're gonna take a quick music break here
4193160	4196640	in studio, and then we'll come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4196640	4201120	We're just gonna do some potpourri here of some various, I think we'll do some Bamani
4201120	4202120	songs tonight.
4202120	4203120	Why not?
4203120	4206440	We'll be right back in just a moment here live at All Games Radio with Part B of Orange
4206440	4207440	Lounge Radio.
4207440	4210360	This is a chance for you to get up and stretch and all that good stuff.
4210360	4216720	We'll see you in a minute.
4216720	4221320	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, February the 28th
4221320	4222320	of 2010.
4222320	4224920	So it's not a leap year, so it is the last day of February.
4224920	4227120	It's gonna be March all over again tomorrow.
4227120	4229440	Can't believe how fast the year is moving.
4229440	4230440	Yikes.
4230440	4231640	We're all getting old really quick.
4231640	4235840	Speaking of which, the song that we just played during break, now unfortunately the podcast
4235840	4239200	listeners can't hear it because you know the songs that we play during the break are copyrighted
4239200	4244960	so we can only do it during the live streaming, but we played a remix by Mr. T, not the I
4244960	4249880	Pity the Foo kind from the A-Team, but Mr. T that did Bamani remixes back in the day
4249880	4252280	from Popin' Music 10.
4252280	4258440	He did a remix of Goonies Are Good Enough from Goonies 2, which was also in the movie,
4258440	4259440	the Cyndi Lauper song.
4259440	4264200	Now I can play a clip, so let me play a quick little clip for the benefit of the podcast
4264200	4274560	listeners.
4274560	4275560	It's good enough.
4275560	4276560	Okay, yeah, right.
4276560	4281640	So I just was, and it was making me think that, God, I loved Goonies 2, the video game on
4281640	4282640	the NES.
4282640	4286360	It was so like kind of like ahead of his time in some ways, but I was firing that up on
4286360	4289960	the FC Mobile not that long ago because I actually have the cartridge of it and good
4289960	4290960	memories.
4290960	4292120	That was such a great game.
4292120	4295820	Even though it really had nothing to do with the Goonies movie, it was still amazing.
4295820	4296820	So F the Haters.
4296820	4297820	There you go.
4297820	4302520	Before we get into Twitter topics and some more gaming news tonight, I wanted to talk
4302520	4304720	really quickly about something I watched this week.
4304720	4308920	And I don't know if you guys, I don't know if Loki or Dark Soccer has familiarized themselves
4308920	4309920	with this at all, but...
4309920	4311760	I know what it is, and therefore I avoided this.
4311760	4312960	Okay, well here it is, here it is.
4312960	4318680	On the PlayStation Network this week, or I should say last week, they released The Tester,
4318680	4323240	which is kind of a PlayStation Network exclusive show.
4323240	4327120	It's kind of like an experimental thing because this is television essentially that was made
4327120	4329020	for the PlayStation Network.
4329020	4334720	So it's a reality show, and I know we've reported on this on the show before, so I think most
4334720	4338320	of our listeners are already aware, it's this reality show where the prize is to become
4338320	4341440	a game tester for Sony Computer Entertainment.
4341440	4342440	That is the prize.
4342440	4343440	Sony Prize.
4343440	4348760	But one thing they also don't say very well, also a $5,000 signing bonus.
4348760	4351320	So there is a cash prize that goes with it as well.
4351320	4353960	So there is at least just that.
4353960	4356320	You'll need it to offset the wages.
4356320	4358480	Well, I checked out the show.
4358480	4364880	Now if you guys don't already know, I am unapologetically a fan of reality game shows.
4364880	4369800	I don't necessarily mean all reality TV, but I loved Survivor back in the day.
4369800	4373360	I wanted to apply for Survivor actually way back in the day, but I didn't have a passport
4373360	4374840	or something, so I didn't do it.
4374840	4378020	But I remember when they were casting for the first season of Survivor.
4378020	4380760	But I just love old game shows, and I like the whole idea of a reality game show.
4380760	4381760	I watched Big Brother.
4381760	4384360	I've done fan games online.
4384360	4388360	I even like Project Runway, and my new favorite reality game show is RuPaul's Drag Race.
4388360	4391060	It's the most amazing show on television right now.
4391060	4395040	What I don't like when they talk about reality shows, I don't like The Housewives of Orange
4395040	4396040	County.
4396040	4397440	I don't like The Hills.
4397440	4399520	And so I agree there's a lot of crap out there.
4399520	4403000	I kind of hate it when people say, I hate reality shows.
4403000	4404000	Reality game shows.
4404000	4407340	Because that's like saying, I hate dramas, or I hate comedies.
4407340	4410760	There's a lot of different types of reality shows, and some of them are very good.
4410760	4414520	But of course, obviously, hearing about The Tester, I'm a little bit apprehensive about
4414520	4416760	this, but I'm like, okay, I'm a fan of reality shows.
4416760	4418040	I'm a fan of video games.
4418040	4420760	I need to check this show out and give it a fair shot.
4420760	4422280	So I downloaded the show.
4422280	4424140	It's about a 22-minute show.
4424140	4427360	It's suitable for a 30-minute broadcast, basically with commercial breaks.
4427360	4433180	And I watched it, and it's not that bad.
4433180	4434880	Are you surprised to hear me say that?
4434880	4435880	Nope.
4435880	4436880	No.
4436880	4439700	It's not terrible.
4439700	4441720	It's a ridiculous concept.
4441720	4445600	I mean, I'm not going to get past the fact that we all know, if you've kind of had a
4445600	4450600	friend that works in the gaming industry, we all know the prize at the end of the day
4450600	4451600	is ridiculous.
4451600	4454120	But at least they throw a $5,000 signing bonus into it.
4454120	4456560	So at least there's that.
4456560	4460220	But I'm thinking to myself as I'm watching this, you know, this is basically a television
4460220	4462000	show I'm watching on my PlayStation.
4462000	4467080	The quality is great because it's in HDTV, and you can download it in HD, and it looks
4467080	4472360	better than most HD Comcast shows because I think most television comes out only at
4472360	4475280	like 720, but this was like 1080 or whatever.
4475280	4480860	So the look of it was really good, and it was put together okay.
4480860	4483920	The editing, you know, the editing was really tight because it's only a 22-minute show,
4483920	4486800	so you don't really get a lot of time to know the people.
4486800	4489220	But the editing was competent.
4489220	4492760	The show was put together well enough.
4492760	4498760	The biggest flaw about the show is that, again, the contest is so ridiculous to begin with
4498760	4505040	that basically the whole elimination and everything that they did was over this one minor challenge
4505040	4510440	that they did that the judges, who were two guys that worked for Sony and Hal Sparks,
4510440	4515160	which I don't know why Hal Sparks is a judge and not the host, but whatever.
4515160	4520040	I realize they need to have some type of celebrity draw, and, you know, I actually like Hal Sparks.
4520040	4525000	I think he's great on The Soup back in the day when he was doing that stuff, and then
4525000	4526840	I Love the 90s and all those shows.
4526840	4530660	I think he's funny, and of course queer as folk, you know.
4530660	4535600	So I think he's a good talent to have on there, although, you know, as a judge, eh, I think
4535600	4539040	he would have been a better host because they have some no-name girl doing the hosting,
4539040	4543440	you know, she's, what, a generic reality show host, whatever.
4543440	4547880	So I guess my biggest complaint is that the competition itself is a little weird.
4547880	4551960	Like I kind of wish they had, like most reality game shows run an hour, even RuPaul's Drag
4551960	4556560	Race is an hour, so that there is like a mini challenge, a mega challenge, and some time
4556560	4558400	to understand what's going on.
4558400	4561020	But I felt like the biggest flaw with the show is that it was just like, it was done
4561020	4566440	so fast that you really didn't get a feel for why maybe one of them left.
4566440	4570440	I'll just spoil the first episode for you guys, two people leave in the first episode,
4570440	4574280	one of them you kind of see coming because they're very strange and awkward, but the
4574280	4579160	other one you're kind of like, I didn't really know anything about this person, so I can't
4579160	4581840	feel bad that they got kicked off the show.
4581840	4584520	But here's the other thing I want to say about this, because I know a lot of people are saying
4584520	4587720	like, what the hell, Rob, you actually like the show?
4587720	4590880	I don't know if I'd go so far as to say like, I like it, I'm going to set a season pass
4590880	4591880	on my TiVo.
4591880	4597800	I just think it was a competent show and quite honestly, it's better than about 90% of what's
4597800	4598800	on G4 television.
4598800	4603000	Here's my problem, the way I looked at it is when I heard that they're doing a reality
4603000	4608000	show where people are going to get to play games and stuff like that, that are first
4608000	4612320	looks at certain games, I saw that as, hey look, it's a 22 minute long commercial for
4612320	4614880	Sony games, no thanks.
4614880	4617220	It wasn't that bad, it wasn't that in your face.
4617220	4622520	They live in this bachelor pattish thing that is all these video games and you know of course
4622520	4627240	the guys like, sweet, Uncharted 2, some of that was a little ridiculous, but that's no
4627240	4630180	worse than the judges drinking Coke at the American Idol's table.
4630180	4633120	You expect there's going to be some of that product placement, but the challenge had nothing
4633120	4634640	to do with the Sony game at all.
4634640	4637960	And I thought actually the challenge that they played in this first episode, which was
4637960	4642820	basically a glamorized version of can you spot the differences between the two pictures,
4642820	4648640	I thought it actually played into the whole what you have to do to be a tester thing relatively
4648640	4649640	well.
4649640	4650640	What's that, Jamie?
4650640	4651640	Nothing.
4651640	4652640	I was talking about Shermie.
4652640	4653640	Oh.
4653640	4654640	Shermie just crapped.
4654640	4655640	Oh, did she?
4655640	4657640	That was her review of the show.
4657640	4659200	Nice.
4659200	4662020	But yeah, I mean they played it up okay.
4662020	4663840	I mean I was expecting a lot worse.
4663840	4669140	The bar was very low, but I got a show that I would watch if I was flipping through TVs
4669140	4672980	with nothing to watch and I stop on G4 TV and the show's on.
4672980	4675880	It's better than most of the crap on that network right now.
4675880	4679280	That still just doesn't sound like enough to make me actually put any effort into watching
4679280	4680280	TV.
4680280	4682760	But yeah, you don't, I wouldn't recommend the show for you, Jamie, I don't think you'd
4682760	4683760	like it.
4683760	4692480	Well, you know, I watch three shows with any variety of regularity, Supernatural, Doctor
4692480	4697800	Who, and let me get back to it.
4697800	4698800	Oh, BBC News.
4698800	4699800	Oh, okay.
4699800	4700800	You know what?
4700800	4701800	What?
4701800	4704780	I was gonna say though, Jamie, I would recommend, however, you watch RuPaul's Drag Race because
4704780	4705960	it's amazing.
4705960	4707280	And may the best woman win.
4707280	4708640	I love drag queens so much.
4708640	4710960	You know what would be so awesome?
4710960	4711960	Me too.
4711960	4712960	What?
4712960	4713960	On Xbox Live.
4713960	4714960	Huh.
4714960	4718720	Now that they're gonna have the Microsoft Game Room thing.
4718720	4719720	Yeah.
4719720	4721400	To bring back Starrcade.
4721400	4722400	Seriously.
4722400	4727180	But, you know, you gotta think though, this is, sure this show is a little eh, but it
4727180	4730960	could be setting the stage for something even greater in the future.
4730960	4735940	Like, you know, it's kind of interesting that, wow, Sony put all this together, who else
4735940	4740560	might deliver their show exclusively on PlayStation Network or Xbox Live Arcade?
4740560	4742720	And yeah, I'm all for Starrcade coming back.
4742720	4744400	Or some type of old school game show.
4744400	4748760	Like, you know, like 1 vs 100, but Starrcade, where you play the games that they're playing
4748760	4750880	during the show and stuff like that.
4750880	4752300	That is a great idea.
4752300	4753300	I would love to see that.
4753300	4756080	To answer Tigerclaw, I wasn't impressed enough with the first episode of V to give it any
4756080	4757940	more thought.
4757940	4761280	And for the listeners that don't know what Darkstar is talking about, Tigerclaw said,
4761280	4762280	V next month.
4762280	4765280	You gotta watch V. So there you go.
4765280	4769520	Oh, Shermie took a duty in the hallway.
4769520	4773000	That's no good.
4773000	4780600	And that's what she thinks of the tester.
4780600	4785840	A shit with no effort.
4785840	4789920	I can't believe the cat just took a dump on the floor in the middle of the show.
4789920	4795640	Dump where dump should not be on the PlayStation Network.
4795640	4801760	Which cat, when forced to watch the tester, takes a crap first?
4801760	4810000	No, to explain, Shermie is an old lady.
4810000	4813000	She's up there now in cat ears and is not in...
4813000	4815920	So she just didn't make it to the litter box or what?
4815920	4816920	I have no idea.
4816920	4817920	I'm trying to figure out what's wrong.
4817920	4819960	I'm going to take her to the vet probably after payday.
4819960	4820960	I hope she's okay.
4820960	4823240	Yeah, she's just been...
4823240	4824240	And anytime she...
4824240	4825960	Well, no, I just...
4825960	4829120	Maybe she doesn't like her litter because she does that when she doesn't like her litter
4829120	4830120	either.
4830120	4832000	Even though it's the same litter I've been using for a while.
4832000	4833000	I think it was just a response.
4833000	4835280	Well, props to her at least going towards the bathroom.
4835280	4836280	I know.
4836280	4837960	At least she didn't do it on the mixing board.
4837960	4839500	No, no, no.
4839500	4841880	She will do it either.
4841880	4846000	When she decides to poop somewhere that is not her box, she will either do it on one
4846000	4849840	of the bathroom rugs right in front of the bathroom or on one of the kitchen rugs.
4849840	4854800	She does not do it so much on one of the kitchen rugs because I yelled at her.
4854800	4857920	She at least does it where it can be easily cleaned up.
4857920	4859320	I think she's making a statement.
4859320	4863840	I think she's like, mom, you should quit your job and pay attention to me 24 seven.
4863840	4864840	She cats it all the time.
4864840	4869440	All right, let's stop talking about poop and talk about game news.
4869440	4873880	She says the show is good for me to poop on.
4873880	4875200	Clearly.
4875200	4877520	How about some rapid fire news, Loki?
4877520	4878520	All right.
4878520	4881120	Well, um, there's actually this is real quick.
4881120	4882120	Sorry.
4882120	4883120	Get your tweets in.
4883120	4886800	I don't think I mentioned it before in the show, but if you have some tweets for tonight's
4886800	4890360	Twitter topics, get those in now, now, now, um, this is kind of interesting.
4890360	4896280	Super Meat Boy is coming to Xbox Live Arcade and actually before the WiiWare version, which,
4896280	4899520	you know, I didn't even realize there was an Xbox Live Arcade version, and now it's
4899520	4903600	coming out before it is scheduled to be coming out this summer.
4903600	4904760	And that's pretty cool.
4904760	4909120	And for those who don't know, Super Meat Boy is a platform action game starring a little
4909120	4913760	character that's made out of meat and you splatter around the screen and that's all
4913760	4915760	fun.
4915760	4921800	Then, of course, there's going to be a tie in game with the new movie Kick Ass that is
4921800	4925400	coming to PlayStation three and the iPhone.
4925400	4931240	And of course, this game kind of reminds me a little bit of the Watchmen The End is Nigh,
4931240	4936320	which I think did a little bit better on the PS3, probably because the Blu-ray was bundled
4936320	4939000	with the game when it came out retail.
4939000	4945160	But the PS3 game will have Facebook integration as well.
4945160	4948480	And I don't know.
4948480	4950640	Game looks just OK.
4950640	4954800	It looks just like a beat-em-up action game, just like the Watchmen one.
4954800	4959760	The movie, though, on the other hand, is pretty awesome and it's kind of, you know, what happens
4959760	4963640	when kids decide to become superheroes, but they don't have superpowers.
4963640	4966000	They just fight crime.
4966000	4969760	It's got Nicolas Cage acting weird.
4969760	4974560	And then on the PlayStation Network, the version of Castle Crashers is getting a brand new
4974560	4976320	addition.
4976320	4983000	Extreme Volleyball Action is coming to the PlayStation three version of Castle Crashers.
4983000	4990160	Apparently they're including a cooperative and competitive volleyball game with online
4990160	4996320	or offline play, and Magic Attacks apparently will be directly applied to your ball as well
4996320	5002720	as there's going to be some leaderboards, spiking moves, and some other stuff.
5002720	5006720	And this is coming from the Behemoth development blog.
5006720	5012320	Sorry, Jamie's having the great Lysol race in the hallway right now.
5012320	5014200	It's a good thing I can't smell anything.
5014200	5015880	Oh, that's right, you're congesting.
5015880	5016880	I can't smell a thing.
5016880	5017880	I was just being polite.
5017880	5020160	I didn't want to sit here and go, Jamie, your house smells like poop.
5020160	5024320	Well, no, I just smelled it because fucking Shermie.
5024320	5025760	She just needs, she just needs a...
5025760	5030920	I was like, I don't know, maybe all this talk about the tester made Jamie crap her pants.
5030920	5031920	I don't know.
5031920	5032920	I don't want to be rude.
5032920	5033920	No.
5033920	5035760	It's Shermie shit in the hall.
5035760	5040520	At least go in the tub.
5040520	5043480	I was, that was a reference to last week's show, you see what I did there?
5043480	5044480	All right.
5044480	5045480	Sorry, Loki.
5045480	5047160	Do you have anything else you want to share?
5047160	5048160	That's it.
5048160	5049160	All right.
5049160	5050160	I got some quick stories for you guys.
5050160	5051560	Actually, I did check out this game.
5051560	5054520	I didn't mention it during my gaming week, but this is something I did check out this
5054520	5056120	week and that was Missile Command.
5056120	5059440	It's a brand new version of Missile Command from Atari.
5059440	5062360	It's free to play and it's on the web and it's like a co-op.
5062360	5065560	It's actually a multiplayer thing by developer OMG Pop.
5065560	5070000	That doesn't sound like another developer I know that does a lot of casual web games
5070000	5074360	at all, but yeah, it's a whole like new souped up version of Missile Command and it's, it
5074360	5075360	was okay.
5075360	5076360	It was cute.
5076360	5077360	It was fun.
5077360	5081480	It wasn't really that much like the original to me, but no word yet if Mr. Awesome is on
5081480	5086680	and playing or what's going on, but you can check that out at Atari.com slash Missile
5086680	5087680	Command.
5087680	5088680	It's free.
5088680	5089680	Can't complain about free.
5089680	5094000	Well, I had no idea that they were trying to do this game, but apparently they are.
5094000	5095800	They're making a game out of Grease.
5095800	5098940	Yes, the play Grease.
5098940	5102040	You know, tell me more.
5102040	5103040	Tell me more.
5103040	5104040	Yes.
5104040	5107860	Uh, apparently, uh, yeah, they're making a video game version of this five Oh five games
5107860	5109440	actually is the people that were making it.
5109440	5110440	I'm not surprised.
5110440	5116640	They have actually found, uh, a, I guess a, a publisher for it or five Oh five games is
5116640	5117640	the publisher.
5117640	5118640	I think I'm sorry.
5118640	5121320	Yeah, they are the publisher who's, who's developing a big head games.
5121320	5127480	Uh, they did chime on the Xbox live that was a recent, no word as to like what the game
5127480	5128920	is at all.
5128920	5130760	How would you make a game out of Grease?
5130760	5133140	Like a karaoke game or it's going to be awful.
5133140	5135520	It's just like, Hey look, we bought the rights to something.
5135520	5136520	Yay.
5136520	5137520	Let's make a game out of it.
5137520	5144120	You know, not them, but like other companies, you know, they'll buy rights for like stupid
5144120	5145120	shit.
5145120	5148840	Like the smile, you know, like the smiley face shirts, smiley.
5148840	5149840	Yeah.
5149840	5151920	There is a company that bought the rights for that made a game out of it.
5151920	5153600	No one remembers it because it sucked.
5153600	5158320	I remember a face ball 2000 that had the big smiley's have a nice day.
5158320	5159320	Exactly.
5159320	5161040	But that game was actually kind of fun.
5161040	5168360	Um, or for example, um, the jelly belly, they have like a jelly belly game cause they licensed
5168360	5172320	that cause the license was really cheap or yummy or M and M's.
5172320	5175080	They made some M and M game racing game.
5175080	5176080	That was pretty terrible.
5176080	5177080	Huh?
5177080	5178080	Well, yeah.
5178080	5181600	Yo, no, it was cool, but that was like way back in the eighties when people knew what
5181600	5186080	the hell the noise kids and annoyed supposed to be making a comeback.
5186080	5189560	It was supposed to be, look, how about a computer game?
5189560	5190560	Everybody wants to play.
5190560	5192720	There's tons and tons of people want to play this star craft too.
5192720	5194680	And of course the beta is going on right now.
5194680	5199200	Uh, apparently due to the number of Blizzcon attendees, not everybody who is at Blizzcon
5199200	5204200	is yet in the beta, but in the next couple of weeks after this first wave, uh, supposedly
5204200	5207440	all the Blizzcon attendees are going to be included in a future wave.
5207440	5209560	It's supposed to be happening in the next couple of weeks.
5209560	5212640	So it might be as soon as the time you guys actually hear this podcast.
5212640	5214120	So you might want to follow up on that.
5214120	5217880	If you were a Blizzcon attendee, you could be playing a star craft too right now, or
5217880	5219000	very soon at least.
5219000	5220360	Dark Sakura.
5220360	5223200	Well, um, this is pretty happy stuff.
5223200	5228600	Um, there are, uh, for a pre-order bonus for super street fighter four, there's a classic
5228600	5230480	costume pack.
5230480	5235080	And so, um, they are for Blanca, Guile, Gen, Feilong and Dalsim.
5235080	5242280	Um, for Feilong he gets a kind of a, uh, Kato costume.
5242280	5243280	And Blanca- I love Feilong.
5243280	5244280	Just saying.
5244280	5246440	Blanca gets Dan's Gui.
5246440	5252160	Which if you, uh, and this goes back to actually, um, Street Fighter Alpha 3, did you ever beat
5252160	5253160	Street Fighter Alpha 3?
5253160	5255400	I don't think I ever played Street Fighter Alpha 3.
5255400	5258880	It was kind of during that period when I wasn't playing a lot of games heavy.
5258880	5262320	One of the endings, Dan and Blanca are just hanging out.
5262320	5265560	And Blanca can- no, Dan can understand all of Blanca's grunts.
5265560	5269920	So he's like, I see you, my friend, let's go out and play.
5269920	5270920	Rolling and rolling.
5270920	5272840	And it has the two of them rolling across the screen, that's where I get the rolling
5272840	5273840	and rolling from.
5273840	5276400	So yeah, he's wearing a Dansky.
5276400	5279160	Um, then- Are they like gay lovers or something?
5279160	5280160	Or is it just- I don't think so.
5280160	5281160	Okay.
5281160	5282160	They're just BFFs.
5282160	5283160	They're BFFs.
5283160	5284560	It's Jay and Silent Bob.
5284560	5288640	Um, and then Gen has a- Heterosexual life partners.
5288640	5289640	Yeah.
5289640	5290640	Gen is shirtless.
5290640	5294240	Um, Guile is wearing a ballistic vest.
5294240	5298760	He's just all kinds of, you know, hardcore ops guy.
5298760	5308720	And Dhalsim is wearing, um, a, uh, I guess just more traditional, um, dress for India.
5308720	5310720	There you go.
5310720	5311720	Very snazzy.
5311720	5318680	He looks like- Who is that fighter in, um, um, Mike Tyson's Punch Out where the little
5318680	5323120	ruby in his turban would flash, and that's how you knew he was about to throw a punch.
5323120	5325240	What was that guy's name in Mike Tyson's Punch Out?
5325240	5327480	I don't remember, but this totally- Because that's what Dhalsim looks like right
5327480	5328480	there.
5328480	5329480	I'm gonna link the picture in the chat room.
5329480	5330480	All right.
5330480	5332000	Somebody, somebody in chat will, uh, yell it out there.
5332000	5333000	Ah, it's Tiger something.
5333000	5334000	I don't remember.
5334000	5335000	Yeah.
5335000	5340600	Uh, Shaoran in chat, by the way, says bromance would be the term for, uh, what Dan and Blanca
5340600	5342120	have going on there.
5342120	5347000	And Dark Tetsuya says, now I have an image of Dan saying snooch to the nooch.
5347000	5352600	You know, there's actually, um, it's funny that the term bromance, there actually is,
5352600	5355200	um, a term called romantic friendship.
5355200	5356600	Have you ever heard of that?
5356600	5358280	I think I have, yeah.
5358280	5359920	And I thought that was funny.
5359920	5363160	Uh, Dark Tetsuya says Great Tiger was the name of that fighter.
5363160	5364160	Sounds right.
5364160	5366340	I think he's right.
5366340	5369240	That's why I love having a live audience, because when I don't know the answer to something,
5369240	5371000	I'll just go chat, help, and they do.
5371000	5372000	It's great.
5372000	5377480	And Akdefta is wondering if they're starting a bad bromance, rah, rah.
5377480	5378480	You know what?
5378480	5386720	I freaking have to listen to that song now after, you know, me really loathing Lady whatever,
5386720	5389000	because you cannot resist the power of Lady Gaga.
5389000	5390000	She's she's amazing.
5390000	5392120	I don't really like any of her other stuff, by the way.
5392120	5393120	It's just that one.
5393120	5394360	I actually kind of like, okay.
5394360	5395360	Nobody's perfect.
5395360	5396360	You'll come around.
5396360	5397360	I know.
5397360	5398360	I know.
5398360	5399360	She'll eventually become perfect like me.
5399360	5406320	Okay, topic time, www.Twitter.com slash O L R. Show us your tweets every week and we'll
5406320	5408520	read some of our favorites here on the program.
5408520	5412340	Of course, we can't read everything, but there's some really good questions tonight, so I want
5412340	5413340	to get to this.
5413340	5415120	Um, let's see.
5415120	5417800	Nut Man wants to know if the podcast will be uploaded tomorrow.
5417800	5418800	Pretty please.
5418800	5419800	It should be.
5419800	5422680	Uh, there shouldn't be a delay at all this week, although I got to say I had last week's
5422680	5426360	show up Monday night, but I should, I've been getting pretty good this year about getting
5426360	5427980	the show up within 24 hours.
5427980	5429900	So I'm going to try and continue that trend.
5429900	5435060	Knock on wood, um, at depth links us to a story that harmonics might not actually be
5435060	5437220	working on rock band three right now.
5437220	5439680	There may actually be something else going on right now.
5439680	5444960	Um, I guess, uh, this is a new story he's linked us to from rock band aid.com.
5444960	5448740	Uh, I guess, let's see what's going on here.
5448740	5452180	There's a Twitter from some guy, I guess, at harmonics harmonics.
5452180	5455760	The creators of the rock band video game is planning on using one of my tracks for their
5455760	5456760	demo projects.
5456760	5457760	Awesome.
5457760	5463040	This is some, uh, other guy and I guess harmonics recently licensed hip hop and dance songs
5463040	5464880	kind of putting it all together.
5464880	5469440	And so now maybe there might be a new frequency or amplitude game is kind of the rumor that's
5469440	5471860	going on right now, which would make a lot of sense.
5471860	5474400	You know, frequency and amplitude kind of came out when not a lot of people knew who
5474400	5478000	harmonics was and they were more experimental games, but they were great games.
5478000	5480760	And I think if they are going to, you know, now that more people know what rock band is,
5480760	5485880	if they're going to kind of come out with a, I don't know what would they call a game
5485880	5492120	around dance music and stuff that's in that frequency, amplitude, vein, I don't know frequency
5492120	5497000	frequency to freak, who knows, Apple and CJ hero.
5497000	5499560	Oh wait, no, we'll see.
5499560	5503480	Uh, Salvex seven sends us a variety of tweets here on one subject.
5503480	5504480	Let me read these.
5504480	5507000	It's a little longer than 140, 40 characters, but it's okay.
5507000	5508000	Does it like the question here?
5508000	5509240	Salvex seven on Twitter.
5509240	5514080	Hey guys, I have an interesting question for you historically, which generation of gaming
5514080	5518160	would you classify as the most contra country that got cut off?
5518160	5523760	I'm assuming contributive to society's development regarding to the social interaction, the fun
5523760	5527140	element escape from one's reality and moral values.
5527140	5530560	I know it's complex, but if you could answer it, I would appreciate it.
5530560	5531560	Take care guys.
5531560	5532560	Have a nice one.
5532560	5533600	What do you guys think?
5533600	5542000	What generation of gaming would classify as the most contributive to society's development?
5542000	5543000	That's a tough question.
5543000	5548960	What just the development of society as in, and he goes on to specify as in, uh, the social
5548960	5554640	interaction, the fun element, the escape from one's reality and moral, moral values, pong
5554640	5556000	haul the way back to old school.
5556000	5557000	Where would we be?
5557000	5560400	I mean, where would the industry be if someone didn't invent pong, the zeroth generation?
5560400	5564520	Yeah, I'd say like the arcade age or something like that.
5564520	5570520	Maybe even like just the, not necessarily the eight bit generation, but like, um, you
5570520	5575800	know, even before that probably the four bit generation, you know, the Tari, Coleco, Odyssey,
5575800	5576800	that kind of stuff.
5576800	5580160	Well, I think in gaming it'd be the day that we got on the radio.
5580160	5581160	Nice answer.
5581160	5582720	Uh, I would have two answers for this question.
5582720	5585640	I would say, I think it's the fourth generation of gaming.
5585640	5588940	The one that involved the NES, the, when the Nintendo entertainment system first came to
5588940	5593660	America because it came out at a time when video games were pretty much declared dead
5593660	5596720	and dying and nobody is interested in video games anymore.
5596720	5601280	You know, after the great video game crash of 84, 83, whatever you want to pay it as.
5601280	5605040	And then, um, the NES comes out and the NES does very well.
5605040	5610720	And who in the, in our generation, you know, where our lower thirties, upper twenties,
5610720	5614760	who in our generation does not know super Mario brothers or link from Zelda.
5614760	5619680	Like who in this generation does not know that from your country, even people that don't
5619680	5623880	do nerdy gaming podcasts every week or listen to them, they know who Mario and Luigi are.
5623880	5625120	You know, those characters.
5625120	5628480	I think it was really the first generation to create a character.
5628480	5633480	I don't think everybody on the street knows who Pitfall Harry, or maybe some of the, well,
5633480	5634480	maybe Pac-Man.
5634480	5637880	I mean, that came from the generation before, but I think, I don't know, something about
5637880	5641760	really bringing it into the homes and so forth with these really memorable characters.
5641760	5647240	I think that was really the generation that did have a song written about him and Mario
5647240	5650040	really didn't other than do the Mario.
5650040	5654360	Um, but then the, my other answer to the question would be the current one.
5654360	5658240	The current generation of gaming, I think is huge to society because for a variety of
5658240	5664160	reasons, a, the, we has, you know, as much as we love to hate on it for, you know, what
5664160	5668280	it is sometimes here on this show, there's no denying that it has penetrated society
5668280	5670720	in a way that most video game systems have not.
5670720	5676280	We sports is like such a typical video game.
5676280	5678400	It's like not even like a video game to a lot of people.
5678400	5684280	We sports is a, it's a, it's like, you know, it's an activity simulation.
5684280	5686800	People don't say, let's come over and play video games and say, let's come over and play
5686800	5690120	we sports or, you know, the, we, you know, it's, it's just so interesting.
5690120	5695200	And then on the other hand, you have Xbox live, you know, really kind of in a way almost
5695200	5698800	killing arcades because people are able to communicate over the internet and talk while
5698800	5701800	they're playing games and develop this whole community.
5701800	5705840	And then, you know, some, somewhat the PlayStation three in this as well, but then now that video
5705840	5708640	games are not just about video games, but they're entertainment boxes.
5708640	5713960	There are these, you know, sets in our living room that do everything that now that they're,
5713960	5716120	that they're getting their own TV shows for heaven's sakes.
5716120	5720400	I mean, I think this current one is, is shaping things up in, in a huge way.
5720400	5721400	That's going to continue.
5721400	5725320	Certainly it's, they're setting it up to have a longer lifespan than the generations before
5725320	5726320	it.
5726320	5727320	So we'll see.
5727320	5730680	Keep in mind the networking side of it and the web play side of this.
5730680	5735160	Remember back, remember we had the X link back in the day.
5735160	5737920	We had, well in Japan they had Satellaview.
5737920	5740440	So it's not a new concept.
5740440	5741920	It's a perfected concept.
5741920	5746320	But it's, it's now, it's penetrate, excuse me, it's penetrated the marketplace and had
5746320	5749480	its effect on society that Satellaview didn't, nobody remembers Satellaview.
5749480	5754520	What was a novel concept then is, and actually I didn't even have to say one of the biggest
5754520	5759960	games that came out that really brought that on was Phantasy Star Online, if you think
5759960	5760960	about it.
5760960	5764600	Cause you could get on and chat with your friends and it was on a console that you could
5764600	5766640	do this back onto the Dreamcast.
5766640	5767680	So I mean that was a big thing.
5767680	5772360	But unfortunately it wasn't until you had like World of Warcraft perfected the MMO in
5772360	5773360	some ways.
5773360	5774920	I guess you get to give some of that to EverQuest as well.
5774920	5778000	Then again, Ragnarok Online was my big crack.
5778000	5780760	But again, society, most people know Warcraft.
5780760	5782760	I'd really say maybe it's the advent of the MMO.
5782760	5787600	But you see, you know, and I'm really trying to take that question as literal as possible
5787600	5788880	is what's the biggest impact on society?
5788880	5792800	Cause if you ask what's my favorite, well the Super Nintendo was my favorite console
5792800	5793800	in that whole generation.
5793800	5795480	Nintendo versus Sega and Turbo Graphics.
5795480	5798680	I mean that was like right when I was in high school and kind of growing up, I remember
5798680	5799680	all that stuff.
5799680	5802280	So that was, that was my favorite generation.
5802280	5805560	But I don't think it necessarily had the biggest impact on society.
5805560	5807200	I think that was more of a bridge.
5807200	5809280	Video games were still a niche thing back then.
5809280	5813720	It did create though a good deal of initial rivalry and discussion because back, you know,
5813720	5815760	for a long time it was like, oh well you have an Atari.
5815760	5817180	Oh now you have a ColecoVision.
5817180	5820480	There wasn't really a big contest between many of the systems.
5820480	5823120	Because really what was coming out was one upping the other.
5823120	5826160	Until you start getting, you know, actual competition going.
5826160	5829600	Like it's funny, you know, I grew up with my Super Nintendo with my Nintendo.
5829600	5833320	Dan grew up with Master System and Genesis.
5833320	5834320	You know.
5834320	5835320	So I bring the Nintendo love.
5835320	5836480	He brings the Sega love.
5836480	5840880	Of course I've developed my Sega love, you know, after I, you know, got to sit down and
5840880	5842640	play the Saturn for a long, long time.
5842640	5847160	But it's, it's an evolution.
5847160	5852800	It really just, I think that's why I want to go back very far back to the, to Pinball
5852800	5854960	Rob to Pinball.
5854960	5858960	Some comments from our chat room, chat.orangelaunchradio.com, live on this Sunday night as we tape at
5858960	5859960	All Games Radio.
5859960	5865800	Gia, I'm sorry, Sharan says, World of Warcraft just standardized both the best and worst
5865800	5867040	of MMO tropes.
5867040	5870600	Again, it's not necessarily about inventing a concept, it's about perfecting it.
5870600	5873400	I think is an important point that was brought up.
5873400	5875080	Anyway, that was a great question.
5875080	5877760	So I'm going to give an honorary gold star to Salvax.
5877760	5878960	He gets a Twitter gold star.
5878960	5881900	I don't think we've given any of those out, but that was one of my favorite Twitter questions
5881900	5883040	we've gotten ever.
5883040	5885280	So gold star for you.
5885280	5888720	Robocoon wants to clue us in on a Steam UI update.
5888720	5890720	It's a beta thing that you can opt into, and that's good.
5890720	5894160	I think Steam could use a little bit of a facelift.
5894160	5897540	I'm not, I haven't read this story as familiar as myself with it in advance, but apparently
5897540	5903400	you can take part in the beta by going into Steam's website in the settings link and then
5903400	5907060	selecting the 2010 UI update under beta participation.
5907060	5909760	But I'm looking at these screenshots and I got to say one thing that does kind of worry
5909760	5914880	me as I'm noticing in one of these screenshots, there's like a list that shows community activity
5914880	5917880	and it shows what games your friends are buying.
5917880	5920560	I don't know if I want that data like out there and published.
5920560	5923960	Like I don't want my friends knowing that I just bought the amazing unicorn game.
5923960	5927080	You know, I'm hoping there's a way to suppress that.
5927080	5929080	Imagine fairies.
5929080	5931800	I'm sure there is a way to suppress that.
5931800	5935760	But there is, there's some unicorn game that's out there on Steam and my boyfriend's been
5935760	5938600	tempting me with this saying, you know you want this game, you know you want this game.
5938600	5942080	When obviously it looks like such crap, but it's kind of one of those things like I want
5942080	5944020	to like buy it for you as a gift.
5944020	5946760	So you're obligated to play it and then you have to talk about it on next week.
5946760	5948400	So LR during how was your gaming week?
5948400	5951520	Like I think we actually have conversation.
5951520	5953520	Are you pulling it up right now or what?
5953520	5954520	Sure.
5954520	5955520	I'm going on my Steam.
5955520	5958160	Look, look for the unicorn game or I'm going to get a text message in a minute.
5958160	5961560	That'll tell me what it is, but magical unicorn game.
5961560	5963320	It's something about magical unicorns.
5963320	5964320	There's an awesome.
5964320	5965320	Okay.
5965320	5970040	It's not even God, here we go, no, no, no, no, no, no, no tangent train, no, no, no,
5970040	5971040	no.
5971040	5972040	Tangent train.
5972040	5976640	This is actually, there's another magical unicorn game that's on, no, don't get me wrong.
5976640	5980720	It's a commercial for this cause I watch Cartoon Network and Adult Swim sometimes.
5980720	5982280	They have a new game on their website.
5982280	5984480	Oh yeah, the farting unicorn rainbow game.
5984480	5985480	I played that.
5985480	5989400	I don't know about farting unicorn game, but it's just this unicorn that's jumping in the
5989400	5994520	commercial and running around and stuff with the, with, I forget what music it, it set
5994520	5998160	this on like eighties rock band music or something.
5998160	5999160	I got to find that.
5999160	6000160	I've played this.
6000160	6001160	I have played this.
6001160	6006120	The chat room is urging us to check the hallway to make sure Shirmi hasn't taken another crap
6006120	6009720	on this topic.
6009720	6010720	Do you smell shit?
6010720	6012120	I don't think so.
6012120	6017960	All right, well, while you're looking that up, let me get a couple of these other tweets
6017960	6019800	out of the way here at our Twitter.
6019800	6025240	Um, MNZeba sends us a Twitter, it says new copy protection technology outrages gamers.
6025240	6027480	Not sure if this is already said, and this is the link.
6027480	6029140	I believe this is talking about Ubisoft.
6029140	6031040	So yeah, we have brought this up on a previous episode.
6031040	6034840	It was brought up a couple of weeks ago, but I think this is still worth sharing.
6034840	6038840	So thank you for the tweet because now it's penetrated like Yahoo and it's starting to
6038840	6041800	get onto the mainstream sites about this copy protection.
6041800	6045840	It's a robot unicorn attack is what the game's called.
6045840	6050560	It's it's secret of the magic crystals. Rob is the one that you're looking for.
6050560	6051600	Is that it?
6051600	6053440	It's also gone down to $6.99.
6053440	6054440	I think.
6054440	6055440	Oh, wow.
6055440	6056440	That's a bargain.
6056440	6057440	Hold on.
6057440	6058440	I just got a text message.
6058440	6059440	Hold on.
6059440	6060440	I'm firing up my phone.
6060440	6064280	And the screenshot where you do crafting with a magic material called anus.
6064280	6065280	That's right.
6065280	6069440	When one of the screenshots, there's a magical crafting, I don't know if it deleted his first
6069440	6072360	text where he told me the name of the game, but yeah, that's the game.
6072360	6073360	What is it?
6073360	6075880	What is it again?
6075880	6078440	I just found the name, the secret of the magic crystals.
6078440	6079720	Yes, that's it.
6079720	6080720	It's a game about unicorns.
6080720	6084440	And in one of those screens, if you look at one of the screenshots, okay, look there,
6084440	6089960	there, there's a crafting material on that screen called anus.
6089960	6094400	If you look at it, one of the, like you have to collect anus, but it's A-E-N-U-S.
6094400	6099600	A-E-N-U-S. Yeah, there it is.
6099600	6100600	As pink.
6100600	6108320	You have to collect all the pink anus you can.
6108320	6110480	You know you want that game.
6110480	6112640	Fuck it.
6112640	6113640	Add to cart.
6113640	6114640	Reverse.
6114640	6115640	Did you really?
6115640	6116640	Are you buying the game?
6116640	6117760	I'm buying it.
6117760	6119760	Right now I'm buying it for seven bucks.
6119760	6120760	Congratulations, Alan.
6120760	6121760	Good job.
6121760	6122760	All right.
6122760	6128440	And I will have a full review of the gay unicorn game complete with anus and horn.
6128440	6129440	All right.
6129440	6132240	I don't know how the anus crafting goes a little later.
6132240	6138280	This might need to be our next, um, uh, cause here on the show that, that we yell and scream
6138280	6141960	for everybody to tweet and Facebook about is to get this on the consoles because I want
6141960	6144760	some pink anus on my Xbox 360.
6144760	6149960	This game, apparently the robot unicorn attack or whatever has a really interesting song
6149960	6154880	that plays in the background, although I haven't played it yet, but on the commercial it sounded
6154880	6155880	funny.
6155880	6158080	It's, uh, the chat room is, uh, it's erasure always.
6158080	6165280	Cause I, in fact, I actually made a live journal post on this like a while back.
6165280	6170680	No, I posted it on Twitter.
6170680	6171680	Hold on.
6171680	6174200	Here's, here's a little bit, just so, just so you have something to reference here.
6174200	6185800	Loki is the actual, oh yeah, that's actually one of my favorite erasure songs.
6185800	6188440	Erasure is a great synthball fan.
6188440	6191440	I love that one too.
6191440	6192440	Yeah.
6192440	6200200	This is, you play this game to unicorns, to unicorns running and farting rainbows.
6200200	6207640	Here we go, Rob, let's see here.
6207640	6210280	Well now Loki's Loki's fired this up in studio.
6210280	6211280	What is this?
6211280	6212280	Is this a flash game?
6212280	6213280	Yeah.
6213280	6225320	Oh my gosh, your unicorn was all twisted in a big pile up in the ground.
6225320	6226760	Can you post this link in chat please?
6226760	6227760	This is so awesome.
6227760	6229160	Can you post this link in chat?
6229160	6230160	Yeah.
6230160	6231760	Okay, thank you.
6231760	6232760	Maybe put it on the Twitter.
6232760	6235680	Can you post it to the Twitter that we're talking about it on the show right now?
6235680	6237120	You know the password and all that.
6237120	6238120	All right.
6238120	6239120	Please post that to the Twitter.
6239120	6240920	That's why I just downloaded the song.
6240920	6241920	Yeah.
6241920	6242920	Thank you.
6242920	6243920	Thank you.
6243920	6244920	Thank you, Dark Tetsuya.
6244920	6245920	Orange Tansit Radio.
6245920	6246920	Oh yeah.
6246920	6250640	So the original tweet had to do with copy protection from Ubisoft.
6250640	6251640	Yeah.
6251640	6254520	Now it's in the mainstream press and I was just going to say that it's interesting that
6254520	6259360	now, you know, that digital copyright stuff has been screwed up so bad it's in the mainstream
6259360	6260360	press.
6260360	6263920	30 minutes into part B and we're still on Twitter topics, just FYI.
6263920	6272080	And then lastly, a tweet from Alex P Carson wanting us to give a shout out to Alex Nicole.
6272080	6273520	It's her first time listening.
6273520	6275040	Shout out.
6275040	6276560	Shout out.
6276560	6279200	Hopefully she didn't turn it off after the farting rainbows chat.
6279200	6281360	I hope we didn't scare her off.
6281360	6282360	All right.
6282360	6285400	Anyhow, and Amazed Shitsuma in chat.
6285400	6286400	Yes, he changed his name.
6286400	6291000	Amazed Shitsuma says Orange Lounge Unicornio is the new name of the show apparently.
6291000	6292880	Who doesn't love unicorns?
6292880	6294280	Like evil people.
6294280	6295280	All right.
6295280	6298380	Anyhow, Loki, I hate to interrupt you because I know you're running to the Twitter right
6298380	6304680	now to post, but Loki, can you give us some more gaming news here on OPLR?
6304680	6308680	It was very distracting, but that game was awesome.
6308680	6315880	Anyways, so there's some cool stuff coming to Final Fantasy 11, believe it or not.
6315880	6321680	They just announced that three new battle arenas are coming to Final Fantasy 11.
6321680	6328920	And those, of course, have to do, I guess, with Abyssia, and it's going to have, let's
6328920	6333940	see here, Vision of Abyssia, I guess will come out during the summer, with the other
6333940	6338800	two Scars of Abyssia and Heroes of Abyssia coming soon after that.
6338800	6344600	And each new area can be purchased for $10 on the Play Online viewer.
6344600	6347240	I'm surprised that there's still expansions coming out to this.
6347240	6349980	I'm not really sure what these new battle arenas are.
6349980	6353560	I mean, this is something that was added way after I left, so.
6353560	6357320	I totally realized that I never finished my other Twitter topics.
6357320	6358320	You never what?
6358320	6359320	Not my Twitter topics.
6359320	6360320	They're rapid fire.
6360320	6361320	Well, then we'll come back to it in a moment here.
6361320	6362320	It's fine.
6362320	6363320	That's all right.
6363320	6370180	But quickly, I wanted to say about Final Fantasy 11 and its developments and what have you,
6370180	6373640	this should kind of squelch those rumors that Final Fantasy 11's shutting down in a couple
6373640	6377800	months to make room for 14, which I always thought was a little bit ridiculous, how fast
6377800	6379240	that spread like wildfire.
6379240	6386960	But this I'm sure is in part to shut up those rumors that 11 is still being supported.
6386960	6389200	You're not going to fit in there, Shirmi.
6389200	6390200	What's Shirmi trying?
6390200	6391200	Oh, Shirmi's trying to...
6391200	6393080	She's trying to poop on the mixing board.
6393080	6394080	It's not working.
6394080	6395080	She's trying.
6395080	6396080	End the show.
6396080	6397080	End the show.
6397080	6398080	All right.
6398080	6401120	You got a little more for us, Logi?
6401120	6402120	Yes.
6402120	6407000	Also, Final Fantasy 14 will be going into closed beta soon, actually.
6407000	6419560	Starting March 11th, and I believe that they did have the VanaFest, I guess, the 2010 website,
6419560	6420560	which was some...
6420560	6424000	They had some news, I guess, about Final Fantasy 11 as well.
6424000	6431680	But on the Play Online website, there's also interesting news, I guess, that the betas
6431680	6435220	will start on March 11th, and I think I've already signed up for this.
6435220	6436640	I want to say I've already signed up for the beta.
6436640	6439040	Yeah, I signed up for it too, but my email box was empty.
6439040	6442120	I don't know about yours, but I saw that story and then I cried.
6442120	6443120	I haven't got anything yet either.
6443120	6444120	But hey, you know what?
6444120	6446640	There's still time, so maybe.
6446640	6449480	Maybe it's one of those things where I won't be in the first wave, maybe a later wave.
6449480	6450480	I'll be hopeful.
6450480	6455280	But it gives me time to finish playing 13, because seriously, the beta for 14 is coming
6455280	6458440	out two days after 13.
6458440	6461760	Two days between Final Fantasy titles in the US, if you think about it.
6461760	6462760	That's kind of strange.
6462760	6466880	Well, and here's something else, if you think about it, if it's going into the beta now,
6466880	6469880	maybe those May release dates are a little bit more accurate.
6469880	6473520	I don't know about May, but I bet the end of the year.
6473520	6476320	It sounds like Final Fantasy 14 will be out by the end of the year, and that's kind of
6476320	6477320	weird.
6477320	6481760	Like, I was not expecting it that soon, especially with 13 having taken as long as it did.
6481760	6483960	So pleasant surprise, I suppose.
6483960	6484960	Yes.
6484960	6485960	Alright.
6485960	6490700	Let's go over to Dark Sakura and whatever stories we skipped over because of all our
6490700	6492720	discussions on unicorns.
6492720	6494680	Acorn farting.
6494680	6502120	Well, just quick stuff, SNK Playmore announced that King of Fighters 13, whatever, it better
6502120	6509120	not suck like 12 did, but it's going to be run on Tytos Type X2 arcade hardware, the
6509120	6511880	same one that Street Fighter 4, BlazBlue, blah blah.
6511880	6515560	And hopefully it'll leak online, just like BlazBlue did.
6515560	6523640	And then there's an online Digimon battle game that's supposed to be coming out in the
6523640	6527760	US that's a version of the Korean Digimon RPG, which I actually, I think I'll freaking
6527760	6530720	play that because I love Digimon.
6530720	6531720	I know you do.
6531720	6534260	Dude, I was a big fan- I think it's ironic that this story's coming
6534260	6537320	out this week, because didn't we have some big discussion last week on Pokemon?
6537320	6543160	Yeah, we were talking about like Pokemon versus, it was in the OLR Madness that's going on
6543160	6544440	on the forums right now with the game voting.
6544440	6547320	We were talking about Pokemon, you were like, whatever, I'm still into Digimon.
6547320	6554680	Well, you know, I actually, I liked Digimon Zero 2 enough to have the movie on DVD, the
6554680	6561720	Japanese version of it on DVD, and um, well, a couple of movies, and I have like the first
6561720	6565240	two volumes of it on, of the Japanese version on DVD.
6565240	6570100	Someone I used to date a long time ago, just went on a couple dates with, made me watch
6570100	6571400	the Digimon movie.
6571400	6572400	I remember that.
6572400	6576480	You should watch the Japanese one, you should watch the Japanese one, it's actually really
6576480	6577480	good.
6577480	6578480	Is it?
6578480	6579480	I think I saw the English one.
6579480	6585920	So, alright, anyhow, going back into some other longer topics tonight, this one is one
6585920	6589360	that somewhat hits close to home, let me talk about this.
6589360	6593460	This is Activision doing a little bit of a douchey move this week.
6593460	6598360	They have pulled the plug on what was a fan project for the King's Quest series.
6598360	6602120	Now we've talked about this on the show before, it was a long time ago, but you might remember
6602120	6603720	the Silver Lining.
6603720	6607320	At one point this was called King's Quest IX, the Silver Lining, but then due to an
6607320	6612160	agreement with Vivendi, who bought the rights to all the old Sierra games, they had to take
6612160	6616560	out King's Quest out of the name, and they could develop this as like a community project
6616560	6618560	with the Silver Lining.
6618560	6620080	So they reached this little settlement.
6620080	6624720	Well now, Activision owns it, because of all the acquisitions that go on and so forth,
6624720	6628420	and Activision has demanded that this game stop completely.
6628420	6631320	They're not honoring the old agreement.
6631320	6634360	They have demanded that this cease and desist immediately.
6634360	6635360	Fuck them!
6635360	6639240	Phoenix Online has been doing this game since 2002.
6639240	6643840	And then yeah, so Activision has basically said, even though they don't have plans on
6643840	6648400	doing a sequel themselves, by the way, King's Quest is pretty much dead.
6648400	6650700	I think they should release it anyway.
6650700	6654200	Well they don't want to get sued, so I can't say I necessarily blame them.
6654200	6656920	Change the name and release it for free.
6656920	6662200	Now we actually, I believe we had one of the developers on the show many, many years ago.
6662200	6667360	I think you'd have to go back to old, like the To-Go podcast from 2005-2006 to find this,
6667360	6670720	but I want to say we had the guy on the show, because I remember going to some virtual press
6670720	6675980	conference online thing about it, and we also hosted a mirror of one of the early betas
6675980	6678860	for the game, I believe when it was still called King's Quest.
6678860	6682520	I think one of the big things they were touting, if I remember right, again this was like four
6682520	6687020	or five years ago, so please, my memory's a little shoddy, was that Roberta Williams
6687020	6691340	actually knew of the project, and although she couldn't officially give it her blessing,
6691340	6694400	she kind of gave it a wink and a nod, you know what I mean?
6694400	6696800	We hosted the beta for this.
6696800	6701640	I don't believe it went anywhere, I believe it's still on our website at orangelaunchradio.com
6701640	6703120	slash tsl.
6703120	6707160	I didn't get a letter, so do you want to see what this is all about?
6707160	6708160	Have fun!
6708160	6713520	I think it's kind of a douchey thing for Activision to do, when they know they're not, I mean
6713520	6717280	I realize they're in their rights to do it, just like when Nintendo shut down the movie
6717280	6720960	project, they were, the Zelda movie, we talked about this a couple months ago, they were
6720960	6726300	in their rights to do it, but with Activision just having bought this, saying they're not
6726300	6730040	going to do anything with it, but then putting the plug on this, when they already stripped
6730040	6736120	anything that was King's Quest related out of it, that's just douchey.
6736120	6740920	Activision gets our douche of the week award, there you go.
6740920	6746180	So I think that's unfortunate, and you know my thought is, I'm kind of with Jamie, I say
6746180	6750060	release it anyway, it's a torrent, but if you're really afraid of getting the pantsuit
6750060	6755480	off of you, seriously go back, change the name, change some of the text, change the
6755480	6758960	characters, nobody's going to freaking know.
6758960	6761440	Activision is not going to seek it out that hardcore.
6761440	6765120	If you go in and change the information so it's hard to detect that it once was the silver
6765120	6768280	lining, I bet you you'll have it.
6768280	6769280	We'll see.
6769280	6772520	I'm curious to see if the game gets leaked, I bet it does, and once it hits the internet
6772520	6774880	there is no going back.
6774880	6775880	We'll see.
6775880	6779120	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us up next?
6779120	6786520	Well, in other news we have a game called Voice Fantasy.
6786520	6792760	Square Enix has put a final trademark for it in Europe, and maybe it could be a Final
6792760	6800160	Fantasy vocal CD, maybe, who knows, but it could be something cool, hopefully it will
6800160	6801160	be cool.
6801160	6807760	Maybe it'll be like a sing-star voice fantasy or something too.
6807760	6811920	I guess it could be a karaoke controlled Final Fantasy 1, right?
6811920	6815480	Or maybe one that you have to sing to progress your game or something.
6815480	6819360	I want to fight, I want to cast holy.
6819360	6822800	Or maybe you have to sing accurately to progress.
6822800	6826000	Are you still playing the fucking unicorn game?
6826000	6827000	Yes.
6827000	6828000	God.
6828000	6832440	Amaze Shitsuma in chat says, douche of the week award, so Shirmi will poop on them.
6832440	6838040	Yes, we give a big Shirmi poop award to the folks at Activision this week.
6838040	6841600	The next time she takes a shit on the floor I'll take a picture of it so we can just send
6841600	6842600	it to whoever.
6842600	6844760	I like that idea.
6844760	6845760	That's a good idea.
6845760	6849480	Loki, put down the game and read some news for us.
6849480	6850480	Okay.
6850480	6856320	No, this is not a big surprise because I don't think it's really taken off as far as I'm
6856320	6857320	aware.
6857320	6858320	PlayStation Home.
6858320	6863520	Apparently advertisers are ignoring PlayStation Home, but they are interested in the PlayStation
6863520	6864520	Network.
6864520	6871920	Apparently a report coming from Brandweek saying that they're opting to pursue opportunities
6871920	6873520	in Xbox Live instead.
6873520	6883280	Apparently ad agency, looks like a publicist, Danaud, John Rafferty, they told the website
6883280	6888480	from the moment one, or from moment one it felt kind of clunky.
6888480	6894360	And once you got through that there wasn't much there regarding I guess the robotic nature
6894360	6897080	of PlayStation Home.
6897080	6902160	And I think, I mean it kind of makes sense because there's a lot of places to advertise
6902160	6908320	in PlayStation Home but if you're like me, you don't use PlayStation Home so you're not
6908320	6915360	seeing those ads so it makes more sense to put it on like say, you know, banner ads that
6915360	6919120	are on the PlayStation Network or banner ads on the Xbox Live Marketplace because you're
6919120	6921920	seeing those as you're going browsing for other things.
6921920	6924040	I think you hit the nail on the head.
6924040	6928520	There's no reason to go into PlayStation Home except when they launch something new that's
6928520	6932280	usually you go in there once and you go, oh, huh, and then that's it.
6932280	6933280	Neat.
6933280	6935240	Just like that, remember that salt that was on there?
6935240	6936240	Yeah, yeah.
6936240	6937240	Yeah, went there once.
6937240	6940400	Yeah, I went in there a couple of times and played it and got some of the little things
6940400	6942400	and I was like, okay, done.
6942400	6943400	Yeah.
6943400	6946640	Because I think they wanted you to pay for like more and I was like, I don't really want
6946640	6947640	to pay for this.
6947640	6948640	Yeah.
6948640	6952920	It's not really, I mean it's just a souped up version of a game I played on my 386 computer
6952920	6956380	back in like 1993, you know.
6956380	6959320	Not really into it.
6959320	6963200	Well something that a lot of people are into is the idea of Nintendo starting over with
6963200	6964680	a brand new Wii.
6964680	6971720	Well it came out at the Nintendo Media Summit thanks to a GameSpot cornering Cami Dunaway.
6971720	6977520	Basically they say that there's not going to be a Wii successor anytime soon.
6977520	6980600	Apparently they're kind of looking for what happened with the PS2 is that they want to
6980600	6984760	kind of re-emulate the fact that they're on top for years and years.
6984760	6988360	Cami Dunaway was quoted in the GameSpot interview saying quote, even though our install base
6988360	6993240	is at this point 5 million households larger than the PS2 install base was at the same
6993240	6996760	point in the life cycle, it still has a lot of room to grow.
6996760	7000080	If you think PS2, there's been about 50 million sold.
7000080	7002900	Wii close to 25, 28 million sold.
7002900	7007000	So it says to me there's still a big audience out there that we can access with the Wii.
7007000	7013240	So basically we still have sold shitloads of these systems so why would we start over
7013240	7014320	with something new?
7014320	7016260	Just because the core gamers are mad.
7016260	7017360	The soccer moms are happy.
7017360	7019320	So F you.
7019320	7023180	It's raining money at my world hahaha.
7023180	7027480	So don't expect a new Wii to be announced at E3 this year.
7027480	7034080	But I think in great Nintendo fashion their way around this would be releasing the Wii
7034080	7041440	HD or something along those lines where it's not necessarily a whole new system but it's
7041440	7045200	a Wii plus like the DS Lite or something like that, you know what I mean?
7045200	7049120	That's what I could see Nintendo doing and then saying well it's still a Wii.
7049120	7050120	Yeah.
7050120	7052360	I don't know.
7052360	7053600	We'll see.
7053600	7058520	Alright anyhow we're gonna get into that section of the show where we interact with your emails.
7058520	7062560	It's the mailbag segment here on Orange Lounge Radio.
7062560	7065920	Every week Dark Sakura opens up the mailbag.
7065920	7068440	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
7068440	7074000	It's all one word, mailbag, M-A-I-L-B-A-G at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you have an email
7074000	7075160	you want Dark Sakura to read.
7075160	7078280	Looks like a lot of people took the opportunity this week, didn't they Dark Sakura?
7078280	7079280	Yeah.
7079280	7081440	Alright well get to reading.
7081440	7084440	Hey OLR Kardashians, okay.
7084440	7089400	I just discovered that I could walk from where I live to Valve's headquarters, yeah.
7089400	7092920	And there's a Gameworks in downtown Seattle that has BlazBlue, Street Fighter 4, Tatsunoko
7092920	7098480	vs Capcom, King of Fighters 1 million, and a few pinball thingies so if you ever are
7098480	7100280	up there for PAX I would recommend stopping by.
7100280	7101280	We went there.
7101280	7102280	Yeah we did.
7102280	7103280	We did stop by.
7103280	7105640	They had that whole room of Sega cranes, right?
7105640	7106640	Yeah.
7106640	7107640	Yeah.
7107640	7108640	And I played a few.
7108640	7111440	Oh since I'm entering high school I was wondering if I should learn Japanese.
7111440	7112440	Is it hard?
7112440	7117000	I would kind of want to know what my important future is telling me.
7117000	7120040	Typed with minor precision at 1240 AM, Austin.
7120040	7126460	Just to let you know, Japanese is not an easy language because honestly I think the biggest
7126460	7129560	difficulty in Japanese is the grammar.
7129560	7132400	Not necessarily the vocabulary but the grammar.
7132400	7133720	It's a little convoluted.
7133720	7137360	I was a Japanese major for a little while.
7137360	7141080	I know a few sites that will give you beginner lessons.
7141080	7143360	You can find them for free.
7143360	7147460	I think one is called iLearn or something but yeah just try a couple of those little
7147460	7153240	online sites and see what you think because I mean it really is kind of a convoluted in
7153240	7155360	comparison to English.
7155360	7158680	It really depends on what industry you want to get into when you get older and maybe you're
7158680	7161720	too young to know that now if you're just kind of like now going into high school which
7161720	7164440	you're probably too young to listen to this show actually so but.
7164440	7168840	Also depending on where you live because when I lived in Alabama it was good for me to know
7168840	7169940	French.
7169940	7172960	And here in California it's really good to know Spanish.
7172960	7174000	It's really good to know it.
7174000	7178160	I mean that's just you know there's a lot of jobs out there where they really want bilingual
7178160	7180880	people that speak Spanish so you might want to think about that.
7180880	7183240	I mean is Japanese really practical?
7183240	7187520	Well if you wanted to get into an industry that has to do with technology and possibly
7187520	7191800	you know relocating to Japan or working closely with Japanese business or finances.
7191800	7192800	Or going into the JET program.
7192800	7197520	Yeah any of that you know then yeah Japanese is going to be a practical language to learn.
7197520	7200280	Again you might be a little young to really know what you want to do.
7200280	7202400	When I was 15 I hadn't a clue.
7202400	7203400	Well I did have a clue.
7203400	7206920	I wanted to be a game show host but that didn't quite pan out.
7206920	7212080	I ended up changing my mind when I was like 24 on what I wanted to do.
7212080	7213720	So I changed my major eight times.
7213720	7215480	Yeah and most people do.
7215480	7217660	But just try to think maybe like one step ahead.
7217660	7221480	Am I just learning this because I think it'd be cool or you know is there like maybe a
7221480	7222680	practical use to this.
7222680	7225880	I think you'll thank yourself later.
7225880	7229960	Anyhow yeah but I agree with the Kuma JP.
7229960	7231140	Do it while you're young.
7231140	7233840	Learn a new language because it's much harder when you're older.
7233840	7236600	And I tried to learn a second language in high school.
7236600	7241520	I tried to learn Spanish and unfortunately I this is going to sound terrible because
7241520	7245040	you know I am a teacher of sorts even though I teach in a corporate environment as my day
7245040	7247000	job.
7247000	7251560	And I think teachers do great things but I had a Spanish teacher that was so terrible
7251560	7253360	she actually ruined Spanish for me.
7253360	7257060	Like I was not able to learn a language because this lady was so bad.
7257060	7258400	Thankfully she's not teaching anymore.
7258400	7260720	She didn't she didn't keep teaching very long.
7260720	7264920	But it's unfortunate that that one person kind of screwed it up.
7264920	7265920	You know.
7265920	7269840	I accidentally closed one of the emails and I don't remember which one it is.
7269840	7270840	Uh oh.
7270840	7271840	Spiadio.
7271840	7273040	Well okay.
7273040	7275800	This is from Tolgak.
7275800	7279600	After thinking about the Ubisoft DRM scheme I got to thinking what would happen if someone
7279600	7282360	DDOS'd the servers.
7282360	7287480	It seems to me like that would be the perfect target for DDOS attack to cause maximum damage.
7287480	7292640	A normal DDOS would only disrupt traffic but an attack against Ubisoft servers would cause
7292640	7295680	everyone's games to shut off and swamp their phone line.
7295680	7298840	I was wondering what you guys thought about this problem.
7298840	7302880	As a side question I wanted to know what you guys thought about having a homebrew no piracy
7302880	7307600	and tech themed show on all games co-hosted by me and Jaded.
7307600	7309720	By the way awesome show on the 22nd.
7309720	7310720	Who's that from?
7310720	7311720	Tolgak.
7311720	7319800	My first question about the um the I'm sorry the what oh the DDOS on the Ubisoft site sorry
7319800	7324000	I thought you had another comment um as far as that goes I think you just give another
7324000	7330400	reason to add to the list of why this type of copyright protection is stupid so just
7330400	7332040	add that to the ongoing list.
7332040	7333240	You bring up a valid point.
7333240	7336920	If Ubisoft gets DDOS there's really nothing to stop it's the same thing as the server
7336920	7339080	going down for whatever technical reason.
7339080	7342160	As far as the question about your all games podcast um that's something that has to be
7342160	7346640	decided by the all games staff which um although we're happy to work with them we don't make
7346640	7350800	decisions there so uh you wanna check out all games dot com and I know there's links
7350800	7355000	there on like how to submit your show and so forth so just kinda dig around there um
7355000	7359040	and I'm sure you'll find it or get in touch with me in chat and I can put you in touch
7359040	7360040	with the right people.
7360040	7361800	New blood fresh meat.
7361800	7365160	Yeah I mean I know they're open to having more ideas and I know what one thing that
7365160	7370440	they don't want is they really don't want more general video game discussion shows cause
7370440	7374800	you know they already have a lot of them including us um admittedly although we've been doing
7374800	7378480	what we do a long time uh but I think the idea of like a niche.
7378480	7384720	I don't know of well yeah I know we are but um I think also uh the idea of like a home
7384720	7389920	brew and I don't know of a show like that on all games unless I'm really behind on who's
7389920	7393680	on the network right now so I think that's always a good thing if you think of an idea
7393680	7395400	for a show that no one's done yet.
7395400	7396960	There you go.
7396960	7398880	Okay well moving on.
7398880	7404120	Hey OLR crew AZHP here again I was listening live to your show on Sunday though I wasn't
7404120	7408000	in chat because I was putting together Ikea furniture at the time I'm sorry.
7408000	7411360	Anyway when I heard you all report on the Ubisoft DRM that requires you to be on the
7411360	7416800	internet constantly in order to play Assassin's Creed 2 my first thought was are Ubisoft insane?
7416800	7420760	Do they want people to pirate their game because honestly once it's cracked the pirate versions
7420760	7423160	will actually be better than a retail copy.
7423160	7426920	You won't have to be connected to the internet to play and if your internet goes down during
7426920	7430760	the middle of the game it won't matter PC Gamer apparently did a test run of the DRM
7430760	7434400	and if you are playing and your internet goes out you won't even get a chance to quick save
7434400	7436200	before it boots you out of the game.
7436200	7439360	You lose all your progress since your last save.
7439360	7442800	Someone obviously dropped the ball here and is completely out of touch with gamers.
7442800	7446100	I was going to buy Assassin's Creed 2 but after hearing about this I don't think I will
7446100	7447240	anymore.
7447240	7451320	Now I don't think I'm going to pirate it since I'm not really interested in the game but
7451320	7455000	it doesn't seem like Ubisoft is actually encouraging people to pirate the game so they won't have
7455000	7459280	to deal with that DRM yours truly is HP and I just think that they're stupid.
7459280	7463560	I really have no comment I agree with your email 100% I really have nothing else to say
7463560	7468080	I think what you say is absolutely valid it's just encouraging piracy.
7468080	7472040	Alright next email it's kind of a cool email.
7472040	7475760	Hey OLR gang a quick question here I'm a techie very much like yourselves and I have a few
7475760	7479280	electronics in the house however it's starting to become a problem as I have a few wires
7479280	7481720	just dangling and crossing under my gaming desk.
7481720	7486620	My Wii, Xbox 360, computer setup all share the same space do you have any personal home
7486620	7491760	solutions or recommendations for organizing an otherwise jungle of wires as well as saving
7491760	7495280	me the time and money in the long run eliminating a potential fire hazard.
7495280	7496340	Randy from Texas.
7496340	7501400	I do I have a lot of suggestions because we do them please you can get a switch box first
7501400	7506680	of all for your systems you can also what we do in the studio is we have zip ties for
7506680	7512760	the although we don't really use them anymore but we have zip ties for our our cables for
7512760	7517520	our mics and for the the plugs and various hookups that way we can minimize what's there
7517520	7523120	to trip over you can also get I believe you can get them at Fry's or any electronics store
7523120	7527620	or computer store or just in general you can actually buy them online they're these kind
7527620	7533640	of long twisty things that they look like the like the the plastic ring binders you
7533640	7538400	know they go on like presentation books and stuff but you wrap you bind your cords together
7538400	7543320	and wrap them around your cords and then it leaves them as a long trail you can also duct
7543320	7549560	tape them to the floor I mean seriously my you can use electrical tape to bind them together
7549560	7557120	to my computer actually let me put in my my card my new graphics card we actually just
7557120	7563320	electrical taped all the bonus wires together so there's lots of stuff that you can do and
7563320	7567580	really you can get almost any of these things you know really cheap you can buy twist ties
7567580	7572400	you can get leftover ties we use in the studio or at the 99 cent store yeah I bought a pack
7572400	7577760	of eight of them for a dollar you know so you just have to look around you know really
7577760	7582480	the thing that you want to do is find something that's going to be non flammable something
7582480	7586680	that can bind them together honestly if you want something that's going to hold them securely
7586680	7592360	your best bet get a switch box or if you have them you know multiple hookups to your TV
7592360	7597080	I would get electrical tape and bind the ones to each specific system together and also
7597080	7601440	if you leave them at the right length for your binding you can if you need to transport
7601440	7606600	them just unplug them and move them easily and labels go a long freaking way even though
7606600	7610720	you might be thinking oh what a pain in the butt or you know they're so silly if you just
7610720	7615480	like label your wires at both ends oh my god you will be so happy later if you ever had
7615480	7620560	to move if you use the electrical tape method just get a sharpie right on the electrical
7620560	7625760	tape yeah ps3 you know it's very easy well you've seen the box of cables that we have
7625760	7629480	rob obviously where it's like you sort of have to look at the end and guess what it
7629480	7636280	is and oh be afraid if you happen to find an n64 or a super nintendo thing because they
7636280	7641640	use the same ones practically you know or if you happen to accidentally hook up your
7641640	7648080	japanese playstation to you know adapter and then realize it won't fit in your us one and
7648080	7652960	you know i'm just going off because it really does it really does help of course we have
7652960	7659720	big bins now in the vault where we keep all of that and don't know which one's which tape
7659720	7668400	all right also for speaker cables i'm just saying um you can get these uh plastic pieces
7668400	7673480	like for example if you're like we have our um surround sound wired and we didn't wire
7673480	7677320	it under the uh floor or anything yet but you can't and this is something i wanted to
7677320	7681680	do we haven't done it yet but you can get these plastic strips that you can adhere to
7681680	7686920	the floor that go the easement office buildings you know that to keep you from tripping over
7686920	7693400	wires that happen to be spread like for your speakers and whatnot so good suggestions yeah
7693400	7697840	you can find this anywhere just make sure that you get something that's you know electronic
7697840	7707300	safe and fire safe more emails one more it's long yay long email long email is long
7707300	7712960	i can't stop playing this are you still playing the magic unicorn game i'm gonna have a racer
7712960	7719320	stuck in my head on i'm gonna be having nightmares about erasure hello there olr this is uh gditz
7719320	7724040	writing in i'm the swedish dude who called a few shows ago and talked about drm and seeing
7724040	7728840	as exams are closing and i can't really spare the time to attend the next live show so i
7728840	7733480	figured i'd answer the call for european to write about it oh good the high piracy rate
7733480	7738180	over here and what might be the cause of it first off i don't have a lot of insight on
7738180	7742560	how game releases or pricing works in italy where the highest rate of piracy occurred
7742560	7747140	according to the study presented in last week's show i do however live in sweden where the
7747140	7753800	famous pirate bay bit torrent site was founded and where piracy is also frequent and now
7753800	7758760	there are quite a few factors as to why i have many times been tempted to pirate release
7758760	7763560	one of the biggest factors is for me whether or not i can purchase purchase a product legally
7763560	7768360	i hit something um when it comes to anime for example there usually isn't a retailer
7768360	7772140	around here to supply them if there is it's all dubbed or subbed in swedish which isn't
7772140	7778120	how i like my anime agreed i hate most english dubs you know i like watching when japanese
7778120	7782320	with subtitles another annoying thing is that the delay between us releasing the european
7782320	7787780	one usually it's usually a week or just a few days but once in a while a game takes
7787780	7792000	almost a full year to get over here one example is rock band 2 with the instrument bundle
7792000	7795640	and at the time of its release i didn't have any rhythm hardware for my ps3 and was stuck
7795640	7799520	with a hard decision from all the reviews and talk about rock band 2 and guitar hero
7799520	7804320	4 it was quickly confirmed that the second hardware iteration from the makers of rock
7804320	7809260	band was superior one and the game was also thought to be better but with the release
7809260	7814000	of rock band 2 bundle in europe wasn't even sent while guitar hero 4 was due in just a
7814000	7817880	few months now piracy wasn't an option since i needed the hardware and ended up buying
7817880	7821800	guitar hero 4 bundle to get the hardware and then bought rock band 2 disc which arrived
7821800	7826920	two weeks before guitar hero 4 as a side effect of this i now despise harmonix a bit for not
7826920	7834560	being able to ship hardware in a reasonable amount of time sorry drm now drm isn't different
7834560	7839160	for us europeans but it's still something to consider when buying a product even more
7839160	7843040	if you want to lend it to a friend install it several times just be able to play it without
7843040	7848520	an internet connection the worst drm i have to deal with on a daily basis is a cad computer
7848520	7853760	aided design program used for making mechanical parts and design requires not only a constant
7853760	7859320	online connection but also requires said connection to go through the school network um we're
7859320	7863820	using autocad interesting you know and we don't talk a lot about the the schemes used
7863820	7870040	in non-games well this means i have to run i have to vpn to the school network at all
7870040	7874080	times when using said software i can't even imagine how such extreme restrictions would
7874080	7879320	urge people to buy it when a pirated copy would mean a lot less hassle cost this is
7879320	7883360	one of the biggest hurdle for many people myself included and it goes a bit beyond what
7883360	7887800	americans have to go through from what i gather a new retail game over in the us cost about
7887800	7896320	60 which would be the equivalent of 450 swedish a swedish kroner however we have a value added
7896320	7900680	tax for each and every item we purchase in stores where the rate for any item can be
7900680	7906520	6 12 or even 25 added to the price in short a video game costs a swedish person 600 kroners
7906520	7912000	which is the equivalent of 80 even if i know the tax goes to education government funding
7912000	7917040	and health care it still leaves a big hole in my wallet every time i buy a video game
7917040	7921600	summary hopefully this letter gave you guys a better image of what gaming and the gamer
7921600	7926320	lifestyle is like across the sea even if we sometimes get treated as less as less important
7926320	7930800	market we still have to we still like to support our favorite developers and actually pay for
7930800	7935040	games we enjoy if you have any more questions i'll be happy to answer them when i get the
7935040	7939960	time but for now i have to get back to studying jeditz out good luck with your exams by the
7939960	7945940	way yes good email um i i'm a little sad though that it didn't come from one of the countries

8112080	8116640	they're douchebags not only that they kind of drive slow or take turns really wide or

8241040	8245920	line at 1877 game olr our username on skype is orange lounge radio and that has to do
8245920	8250880	with a teaser trailer that was released this week um there's a new teaser trailer that
8250880	8256520	just uh hit the internet for pac-man battle royale yes it looks like that that early trademark
8256520	8261400	that was discovered is true there is a new pac-man game coming out and it's called battle
8261400	8266400	royale outside of that what else is this game about i don't know because this is probably
8266400	8271420	the worst teaser trailer i've ever seen in my life it's 13 seconds ready here it is there's
8271420	8280240	the namco logo and then oh yes i know that noise that's pac-man there's the logo that's
8280240	8284920	it sneak peek at amusement expo 2010 that was the whole teaser right there they didn't
8284920	8290640	tease anything we already kind of knew about it was a tease we're gonna tease you and let
8290640	8297120	you think that we've given you a teaser oh tease right but you can see at least on the
8297120	8301560	logo that there are four different colored pac-mans there's a yellow a red a pink and
8301560	8305920	a blue kind of like the ghosts in a weird way although i believe one of the ghosts is
8305920	8310040	orange not yellow but still it's chasing a ghost but it did they are chasing a ghost
8310040	8315200	so maybe it's some type of multiplayer pac-man ce that seems to be the popular thought as
8315200	8320280	to what this is all about plus they are showing this at the amusement expo 2010 so the thought
8320280	8327960	is mm arcade game possibly yeah arcade games so that's always good news to know that new
8327960	8331560	arcade games are coming out because unfortunately it's a genre we don't hear enough of in this
8331560	8337360	day and age so there it is all right we're gonna go to the skype line right now at one

8366760	8372480	for those new to the show i'm in chile right now uh-huh so so that's the big place that's
8372480	8377040	on the news lately because of an earthquake yes we've heard about it and where exactly
8377040	8381560	in chile are you i'm actually in santiago like in one of the major cities i was hit
8381560	8386640	by it wow are you but you're calling into the show so your internet's working i mean
8386640	8391440	is everything actually my my internet was working before my phone worked wow it's crazy
8391440	8395840	i don't understand how that happened the first thing i could do to tell like my mother in
8395840	8401040	argentina and like my friends and stuff that i was okay was through facebook wow weirdest
8401040	8405520	thing no no uh-oh this kind of leads into that whole talk we were having about social
8405520	8408760	networking did you hear that didn't i say that there are legitimate reasons and then
8408760	8413600	there's just the crap yes but it's it's it's still interesting in this context honestly
8413600	8419860	in that context the first click i did was to hit submit to say i'm okay the second click
8419860	8426680	was to join the i survived the earthquake group that's exactly what i did very nice
8426680	8431240	very nice well i'm i'm really glad to know you're doing okay and for any of our listeners
8431240	8435760	who might remember you from your previous phone calls um i'm i'm sure they're glad to
8435760	8440400	hear that you're okay too so yeah i'm assuming that's um vj ramen's idea that i that i call
8440400	8444200	in to let people know in case they hadn't heard but yeah no that's good to know are
8444200	8447800	you still doing a regular show i know you used to do the role-playing show but i think
8447800	8453520	you guys put that on hold right yeah well i moved here chile last year and uh i had
8453520	8457640	to put it on hold because of you know work and not knowing my schedule and stuff so i
8457640	8462640	put it i didn't put it on hold myself i gave the show like the reins of it to one of the
8462640	8467960	co-hosts and he decided to put it on hold and definitely so gotcha that's that but you
8467960	8472880	know i've been like uh about two weeks ago i was on a guest thing on video game news
8472880	8477920	radio oh fun so you know i was there if you care to listen to my musings but are those
8477920	8482800	the guys in cleveland or am i yeah they are they are okay oh wow okay cool yeah they're
8482800	8486240	the other guys that have been doing this a show forever like i think they've been on
8486240	8489720	about as long as we have this show as long as you guys have it's crazy that's cool yeah
8489720	8493640	it's a very different show than us it's it's more yeah you must have been calling in to
8493640	8499880	talk about uh like halo 3 or or some of the shooter games because they play or the call
8499880	8504840	of duty type stuff that's oh that's that's more the type of stuff they get into right
8504840	8508520	the best thing that they do is when they talk about nothing that's related to video games
8508520	8513000	honestly they just go on rants about how one of them is a trucker the other one is you
8513000	8517360	know a part of a job and it's hilarious i don't know how interesting that uh that would
8517360	8521500	be the uh interesting part of their show too honestly they actually had a spin-off they
8521500	8527200	have a spin-off show uh that they called some midwest wasteland i believe the name and uh
8527200	8530080	that's all they talk about like they just said you know what we're gonna scrap the video
8530080	8534920	game part of it and just go with what people actually like so it's pretty funny it's interesting
8534920	8539240	you bring up spin-off shows because you know jamie was doing a comic podcast for a while
8539240	8542880	and i know she had to put that on hold but uh there might be other spin-off shows in
8542880	8547720	the works you never know what might be coming so stay tuned so uh yeah you know i just wanted
8547720	8552180	to call in about that uh i didn't get hurt more than you know you know scraps bruises
8552180	8556840	that kind of thing from you know moving debris and stuff because one of our walls actually
8556840	8561720	came down wow uh that separates our well like our house from the neighbors and it fell down
8561720	8567560	on our cars so so our cars are now like you know they're covering rubble and now they
8567560	8571480	need to be repaired and stuff i remember jamie had a wall fall on her car i was just about
8571480	8576960	to say yeah i remember that happening it was um at my old apartment complex we had uh this
8576960	8584120	sort of uh stucco and brick wall that was around uh the dumpster and we had that windstorm
8584120	8589720	and the wall actually fell over on the car right yeah and it just dented one ridge on
8589720	8594040	it from where it impacted thankfully the car was still drivable though it looked like like
8594040	8600840	a just a ugly thing but yeah that's a car it's here so the car is just a car it's replaced
8600840	8604280	yeah that's yeah that's the only thing i can be thankful of although i mean i don't know
8604280	8608280	you guys are in california so you kind of are used to like you know the earth shaking
8608280	8614000	i suppose the place we live is not nearly as bad with the earthquakes we've felt a few
8614000	8617280	but they're usually not that bad but i do go to san francisco a lot and i have a lot
8617280	8619960	of friends over there you know and it's a little more it's a little more prevalent over
8619960	8626060	there um but it's just it's weird how many earthquakes there have been lately like in
8626060	8631600	the last two months there have been four major earthquakes haiti chile japan and taiwan and
8631600	8635860	there was all the same there was also a pretty big one in california on the north coast it
8635860	8641340	was off the coast but it was uh the out in the ocean by eureka like i remember it made
8641340	8646160	the news here it was it was above a six it's a pretty big deal yeah well actually we've
8646160	8651080	We've been having, you know, the earthquake itself here, where it hit here in Santiago
8651080	8653080	was about 7 point something.
8653080	8657480	It wasn't quite 8 and at the epicenter it was 8.8.
8657480	8658480	But we've been...
8658480	8659480	We've got 2012, 2012, 2012.
8659480	8665120	Yeah, if you look at the footage that you will see on TV, most likely from that place,
8665120	8668160	which is about 300 kilometers away from here.
8668160	8670600	But still, you know, in earthquake distances that's nothing.
8670600	8672780	Like it still hits pretty hard all around.
8672780	8678080	So, you know, it wasn't as bad as that, but still what's funny or not that funny actually
8678080	8683320	and that actually has me scared shitless lately is that every few hours there's going to be
8683320	8684320	an aftershock.
8684320	8689560	And those aftershocks can reach 6.1, 6.5 and all of a sudden you're just doing your things
8689560	8691240	and everything's just shaking again.
8691240	8696720	And you know, after we're waking up at 3.34 a.m. to an earthquake that, you know, fell
8696720	8700840	the wall on your car, you know, you get really nervous all the time.
8700840	8704600	Especially for me, this is my first major thing because I live in Argentina.
8704600	8705600	Nothing happens.
8705600	8706600	Like there's no earthquakes, no tornadoes.
8706600	8709440	Well, I heard they felt this one in Buenos Aires, so...
8709440	8715360	Yeah, yeah, but I've been in Buenos Aires when we quote unquote feel an earthquake and
8715360	8718360	it's like, oh, look, there's a wind gust.
8718360	8719840	And it's like it's nothing.
8719840	8722720	But like being here, I was honestly just...
8722720	8724520	I don't remember being afraid.
8724520	8725520	I don't remember anything.
8725520	8731680	I just remember like running away outside, away from trees and walls, just, you know.
8731680	8736240	Footy monster, just, you know, just do your best to be safe and, you know, don't live
8736240	8741360	in fear too bad because, you know, if it's your time, then lightning could strike you
8741360	8743360	when you're walking down the street, you know.
8743360	8745000	That's true.
8745000	8746040	Anything could happen ever.
8746040	8747040	So don't live in fear.
8747040	8748120	But always have a plan.
8748120	8751840	And I think this is a good lesson for all the listeners.
8751840	8755200	You know, even though we're a video gaming podcast, this is still a good opportunity
8755200	8760120	to talk about, you know, if something bad happens, do you know what you would do?
8760120	8763760	Like for example, you listening to this show, bam, something's happening right now.
8763760	8764760	There's an emergency.
8764760	8766520	An earthquake happens where you are right now.
8766520	8767520	Do you know what you would do?
8767520	8772360	I have one piece of advice in regards to that because it's been baffling my mind what people
8772360	8773800	have been doing here.
8773800	8777880	If there's an earthquake going on, if there's some sort of natural disaster going around
8777880	8780360	you, don't grab your laptop.
8780360	8782080	Don't grab your DS.
8782080	8783080	Just get out.
8783080	8784080	Just go get...
8784080	8785080	Be safe.
8785080	8787600	Put your long shoes on because that's probably going to be dangerous if you're just walking
8787600	8791600	in a flooded place and, you know, try to get shoes at least.
8791600	8794400	But other than that, just get out and everything else is replaceable.
8794400	8799320	I've been looking at people ransacking like supermarkets and department stores and they're
8799320	8804440	taking LCDs with them when they don't even have a house anymore and then to feed themselves.
8804440	8805440	I don't even get it.
8805440	8806680	Like some people are stupid.
8806680	8808040	They react stupidly to this thing.
8808040	8809560	So that would be my advice.
8809560	8810560	Be smart.
8810560	8811920	Just be safe first.
8811920	8813520	Then worry about everything material.
8813520	8817920	That is some unfortunate but necessary advice, especially for a tech-savvy crowd.
8817920	8821360	Footy, I'm going to have to let you go to get some more calls, but stay safe, okay?
8821360	8822360	All right.
8822360	8823360	Thank you so much, guys.
8823360	8824360	We're all thinking of you.
8824360	8825360	Take care.
8825360	8826360	You too.
8826360	8827360	Bye.
8827360	8828360	Oof.
8828360	8829360	I hope that's the last of it.
8829360	8830360	I hope there's not another big earthquake coming.
8830360	8831360	Oh, boy.
8831360	8832360	Oh, boy.
8832360	8833360	All right.
8833360	8834960	Well, we still have time for some more calls.
8834960	8835960	1-877-GAME-OLR.
8835960	8838360	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8838360	8839360	Feel free to call in.
8839360	8841440	Tell some dick and fart jokes to kind of relieve the tension a little bit.
8841440	8842440	It'd be nice.
8842440	8845400	We're going to talk about the unicorn game with Loki because he will not stop playing
8845400	8846400	it over there.
8846400	8847400	I can't help it.
8847400	8848400	It's so addicting.
8848400	8849400	I just found something else disturbing.
8849400	8850400	Sure.
8850400	8851400	What's that?
8851400	8852800	The Wonder Twins are on Smallville now.
8852800	8854280	Goody, goody.
8854280	8855920	What's that mean?
8855920	8857480	Wonder Twin powers activated.
8857480	8858480	Oh, God.
8858480	8859480	Wow.
8859480	8860480	Amazing.
8860480	8861480	All right.
8861480	8862480	Let's go to the phones.
8862480	8863480	Hi.
8863480	8864480	You're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
8864480	8865480	Who's this?
8865480	8866480	Hey, it's Rama.
8866480	8867480	What's up, everyone?
8867480	8868480	Hey, Rama.
8868480	8869480	How are you doing?
8869480	8870480	We're good.
8870480	8871480	How are you?
8871480	8872480	I'm good.
8872480	8873480	A couple of things.
8873480	8877920	Well, I want a reference back to the beginning of the episode about how they're trying to
8877920	8882000	pass that little ban on swearing for a week.
8882000	8885440	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, huh?
8885440	8886440	Yeah.
8886440	8891120	A few months ago, they tried to do the same thing here in New York, but they tried to
8891120	8893840	ban the N-word.
8893840	8896520	It didn't get that far.
8896520	8901280	You know, and free speech is free speech, so I wouldn't support that.
8901280	8907200	But there's a huge difference between the N-word and the F-word.
8907200	8908200	You know what I mean?
8908200	8910640	Yes, I do.
8910640	8911640	There's a huge difference.
8911640	8915520	I still think people just shouldn't say the N-word out of good taste.
8915520	8920880	Even if we were going to say, you know what, we're going to have our week where we're just
8920880	8925840	going to start swearing profusely in protest of this law, and we're going to say every
8925840	8929600	dirty word we can think of, and we're going to say fuck, shit, piss, so forth, I still
8929600	8931800	wouldn't say that word.
8931800	8933120	You know?
8933120	8934120	Of course.
8934120	8939440	I mean, there are times I find myself saying it by accident, or depending on the company
8939440	8943040	that I am with, you know?
8943040	8946840	But there are times I do find it a little bit offensive, but half the time I just don't
8946840	8950960	care, because it kind of falls into free speech, and it just doesn't bother me at all.
8950960	8951960	Right.
8951960	8956000	I'm like, you know, and I read a comment from the chatroom, GS68 says, wait, is it not being
8956000	8958880	able to say the N-word censorship?
8958880	8960680	I guess, yeah, it is.
8960680	8964920	But my whole thought is that I just don't want to say that, because there's a big heavy
8964920	8970280	weight that comes with saying that word, and a lot of responsibility, like, you know, and
8970280	8973120	it's one of those don't write checks your ass can't cash kind of thing.
8973120	8974240	Does that make sense?
8974240	8975240	You know?
8975240	8978980	So if you're going to say a word like that, you better be prepared for the social repercussions
8978980	8986960	that come with a very, what's the word I'm looking for, a very emotion-inducing word.
8986960	8991760	Well, Chris Rocks, though, said that if it's Christmas Eve, and someone beats you in the
8991760	8996000	head when you're trying to buy the last Barbie doll, that you can call them that for, like,
8996000	8997000	45 minutes.
8997000	9002040	Yeah, at four o'clock in the morning, within a two-block radius, yeah.
9002040	9003880	And you have to show your receipt.
9003880	9004880	Uh-huh.
9004880	9009920	Yeah, I actually listened to that very recently, that was funny.
9009920	9016440	Excellent from Kitsune in chat, saying the N-word is disrespectful, saying fuck is not,
9016440	9018280	unless you call someone a fucker.
9018280	9021000	But I call people fucker all the time, I call my husband fucker.
9021000	9024640	I call people fuckers and motherfuckers all the time, and sometimes it's a term of endearment,
9024640	9025640	like bitch.
9025640	9031360	Like, God, Jamie, you're such a bitch, but I mean that in positive, you know?
9031360	9036760	Back when I was hanging out with a certain somebody, we used to, we actually had a whole
9036760	9040800	conversation about that, about how the only people who could use those particular terms
9040800	9046600	of the people are the ones that applied to, you know, contextually, you know, and they
9046600	9049560	even had a mention of that in the Hebrew Hammer, I thought was absolutely hilarious.
9049560	9057000	Um, but, uh, so we used to go around, you know, calling each other, I guess, the H-word.
9057000	9058000	I'm gonna say it.
9058000	9059000	Honky.
9059000	9060000	Oh, okay.
9060000	9061000	I was gonna say, what pray tell is the H-word?
9061000	9062000	Okay.
9062000	9063000	You know, cracker and everything.
9063000	9064000	Yeah, yeah.
9064000	9067000	You know, because it was like, okay, well, so they can do it, why can't we?
9067000	9072360	So we had that conversation, so we just started going around doing it, you know, as, as a
9072360	9079000	point of order, you know, it's not, it's not supposed to be insulting when you're the one
9079000	9080000	doing it.
9080000	9084120	When it's, it's sort of like you taking it and turning it around.
9084120	9088200	At the same time, you know, if someone else came and said that, it'd be like, oh, insult,
9088200	9089200	blah, blah, blah.
9089200	9093920	You know, but, you know, I, I could go on a whole rant about this.
9093920	9094920	I believe it.
9094920	9097360	And we'll tie this into video games because you might be sitting there going, what is
9097360	9100480	this discussion on language and words have to do with video games?
9100480	9106680	Sign on to Xbox Live and play any popular multiplayer game on Xbox Live and you will
9106680	9111200	see why this discussion is important because that whole spiel I said about don't write
9111200	9114520	checks your ass can't cash when it comes to saying some things.
9114520	9115520	Yeah.
9115520	9121540	Like some people like to, or love to hide behind that anonymity on Xbox Live and just
9121540	9126520	write checks left and right that are going to bounce if you know what I mean.
9126520	9127520	Wow.
9127520	9133080	So anyhow, Rama, after such a deep conversation, do you have a dick and fart joke or at least
9133080	9136800	a video game you've been playing lately?
9136800	9140760	Video game, but before I get into it, I just want to know, did you hear me on my keyword?
9140760	9141760	No.
9141760	9142760	Okay, good.
9142760	9143760	Okay.
9143760	9146480	Um, no, you're fine.
9146480	9149120	I downloaded Blaster Master Overdrive.
9149120	9150840	Ah, yes, yes.
9150840	9152360	I talked about this a couple of weeks ago.
9152360	9153440	What did you think?
9153440	9154800	I really liked it.
9154800	9157800	Um, my roommate, he's, he's played it.
9157800	9163000	He, his main gripe is the fact that in the original NES version, you could jump higher
9163000	9165920	with Sophia.
9165920	9169140	I didn't even catch that difference, but that's a good one.
9169140	9170140	He caught that.
9170140	9171960	The controls were what pissed me off.
9171960	9173960	That whole straight with the button.
9173960	9174960	Ugh.
9174960	9175960	Yuck.
9175960	9178720	So, but otherwise you liked it?
9178720	9180280	Classic controller right there, you know?
9180280	9181280	Yeah.
9181280	9182280	They needed the classic controller.
9182280	9186560	It's just, there were these few little imperfections with the game that needed to be fixed.
9186560	9189000	You know what I mean?
9189000	9192080	But the fact of the matter is we have a sequel.
9192080	9195320	I think we're kind of more excited about that than anything else.
9195320	9196320	That's true.
9196320	9197320	At least it happened.
9197320	9198320	Better than nothing.
9198320	9200360	All right, Rama, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you
9200360	9201360	so much.
9201360	9202360	Okay.
9202360	9203360	No problem.
9203360	9204360	And have fun with Blaster Master and the remixed music.
9204360	9205360	That's pretty good.
9205360	9206360	All right.
9206360	9207360	Later.
9207360	9208840	Um, we can probably squeeze in one more call.
9208840	9212840	I need to go to Loki though if he's taking a break from the unicorn game and see if there's
9212840	9213840	any last minute stories.
9213840	9214840	Jamie too, if she has anything.
9214840	9216840	No, I'm ranting in the chat room.
9216840	9217840	Really?
9217840	9218840	Yep.
9218840	9219840	Okay.
9219840	9222600	Apparently the SRB has revealed yet another Lips game on the way.
9222600	9229000	Apparently it's called I Heart the 80s and it will feature such songs including, let's
9229000	9230000	see here.
9230000	9235560	That doesn't really say, but they say some of the songs, of course, or lyrics that are
9235560	9236560	in there.
9236560	9237560	She's a very kinky girl.
9237560	9239120	I really need to love.
9239120	9244320	I really love to taste her and you don't have to sell your body to the night.
9244320	9246200	So I don't even recognize those songs.
9246200	9248920	I recognize that she's a very kinky girl.
9248920	9251000	I do recognize that one.
9251000	9252000	That one I recognize.
9252000	9253800	Let's take a quick call.
9253800	9254800	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.
9254800	9255800	Who's this?
9255800	9257120	Good evening.
9257120	9260920	You crossed the, uh, supposed like, Oh, what the fuck?
9260920	9261920	I'm lost.
9261920	9262920	It anyway.
9262920	9263920	Hello there.
9263920	9264920	Oh Lord.
9264920	9265920	This is my kid.
9265920	9266920	Hello.
9266920	9267920	Hi.
9267920	9268920	How are you doing?
9268920	9269920	I'm doing just fine.
9269920	9273320	Now, what do you think about this whole fact that now we have like a second Swedish listener?
9273320	9274800	Are you okay with that?
9274800	9275800	What?
9275800	9276800	Yeah.
9276800	9278800	Did you hear that?
9278800	9280840	He called in a couple of weeks ago too.
9280840	9282880	We have another guy in Sweden who listens.
9282880	9284440	Oh damn.
9284440	9285440	Of course.
9285440	9286440	I know Sweden's a big place.
9286440	9287440	I'd be all like, do you guys know each other?
9287440	9290600	But you know, that would be like a little silly because that's like when people ask
9290600	9295040	me if I see celebrities, cause I live in California when LA is like eight hours away from here.
9295040	9298480	And even when you're in LA, you don't really see celebrities cause celebrities don't really
9298480	9304800	like to, you know, they don't really go out in public and shop at, you know, Vons often,
9304800	9307160	you know, it's, it's, it's different.
9307160	9308800	But anyway, what's on your mind?
9308800	9309800	I'm sorry.
9309800	9310800	I didn't mean to get on the tangent there.
9310800	9316960	Uh, well, what was I gonna, well, I have a question for Jamie actually since, well, uh,
9316960	9324880	how would you, if someone, if a Sims 3 player that plays Sims 3 quite a bit would actually
9324880	9329280	attempt to try to play Sims 2, how would that feel?
9329280	9332000	Wait, wait, wait, say that.
9332000	9333000	Taking a step backwards.
9333000	9340120	I think like if you're a Sims 3 fan, I've gone back and played Sims 2 and it was fun
9340120	9344520	picking up my old games cause there's actually, um, because the mod community, you know, there's
9344520	9347720	so much more out for Sims 2, I could do a whole lot more in my games.
9347720	9350760	I really enjoy going back to Sims 2 every so often.
9350760	9355560	But I, I, I'm, wait Sims 3 is catching up.
9355560	9363320	So yeah, well, yeah, because, well, the, because I have been, because the most accurate, the
9363320	9369800	most fun I'm having is that since I have the expansion, since I have the World Adventures
9369800	9379200	expansion, I have this, I, I, I like having my Sims doing like doing the spar part against
9379200	9384280	each other because like the kung fu part is like way entertaining actually.
9384280	9388880	I just have to share, I'm looking over at DarkSakra's desk and World Adventures is sitting
9388880	9393240	right on the desk under, under one of her knitting projects right there and then high
9393240	9395000	end loft stuff is right there too.
9395000	9396440	Yep, I just got them together.
9396440	9397440	Wow.
9397440	9398440	It's, I need to re-install everything.
9398440	9401440	It's just funny you brought it up cause they're sitting on her desk right now.
9401440	9404120	I'll take a picture.
9404120	9410920	Speaking of high end, high end loft stuff, do you think it's worth it?
9410920	9411920	They're worth it.
9411920	9419240	Because I, the problem myself is that, well, because I was found like cheap, found like
9419240	9430360	cheap Sims 2, Sims 2 game was that I found like, like the original Sims 2 and a few expansions.
9430360	9445840	The expansions for the second part is the animal thing, whatever, the pets and the travel
9445840	9458080	parts and the supposed annoying thing is that, well, the expansions in Sims 2 that I'm interested
9458080	9461000	of I don't have yet.
9461000	9473120	Since the expansions that I'm interested in are the year round, the seasons and free time
9473120	9483000	because well, at the current, my Sims 3 game I find is a bit boring, but in a way kind
9483000	9492000	of funny since, well, I like to have my, have my, have my Sims sleeping outside.
9492000	9496520	Like with, yeah, well I know that for world adventures you've got the tents and everything.
9496520	9502320	To be honest, my whole thing with, with Sims 2 was really just building houses, which is
9502320	9505220	the same thing I do in Sims 3.
9505220	9507160	I love building houses.
9507160	9509920	So that's really all I do in it, is just build houses.
9509920	9511200	Oh well.
9511200	9516680	But I do, if you were looking, if you don't want to pay for, you know, like the high end
9516680	9520560	loft stuff, because I mean, I got it because, you know, it was 20 bucks.
9520560	9521560	I was there.
9521560	9523240	I had the money to blow.
9523240	9524760	That's why I got it.
9524760	9532360	But if you go to mod the Sims or the Sims resource, you can get all kinds of stuff.
9532360	9536640	And if you, you know, if you sort right, you know, for which expansions that you have,
9536640	9542000	you can get all kinds of, of just really cool stuff that's all made by, you know, user made
9542000	9543000	content.
9543000	9547280	Yeah, but here's the other thing, I don't even know if you can tell me, but I, the only
9547280	9552220	thing I want to know in any kind of way is that, well, are there, are the stuff that's
9552220	9561360	included in high end loft stuff, are there better, actually a point better than things
9561360	9567000	in the original, things that you get, that you get in the expansion or the original game?
9567000	9570080	Well, I haven't actually got it to run yet.
9570080	9571080	Okay.
9571080	9575520	Yeah, mine froze, I think because of all the mods I have already installed, because I have
9575520	9581120	like the no blur mod, you know, so you can actually see them naked.
9581120	9584680	I hate the blur, it just annoys me.
9584680	9591000	And I have like, you know, a couple of slider hacks so that I can, you know, change different
9591000	9596160	parts of the body and I think I might have to reinstall everything to get my games to
9596160	9597160	play.
9597160	9603560	Well, I have, and I can't, I can't say anything on that because I have, I'm using no mods
9603560	9607360	at all, unfortunately.
9607360	9608360	So I will.
9608360	9611320	Well, maybe she'll, she'll have a better answer for that component in a couple of weeks when
9611320	9613960	she gets all that fixed, but kind of going back to the original question, I think that
9613960	9619040	the best point that was made by, by Jamie there was the whole point about that if there's
9619040	9622600	something you want to go back and kind of experience that was in too, especially with
9622600	9625880	all the mods that were done for it and probably a bunch of scenarios that exist out there
9625880	9628640	on the internet and so forth, that's really the best way to do it.
9628640	9630440	And the fact it's, it's dirt cheap now.
9630440	9631440	Yeah.
9631440	9636000	You can get the whole Sims Uber collections gotta be really affordable at this point,
9636000	9637000	right?
9637000	9638000	I think so.
9638000	9640960	I mean, you probably get like, I think they do like whole box sets now, but Aki ripper,
9640960	9644640	I say, take it to the extreme, go all the way back and play Sims one.
9644640	9645640	Oh no.
9645640	9652840	Uh, and I don't think that's possible with my computer since I'm running, uh, running
9652840	9657200	64, 64 bits, uh, seven windows seven at the moment.
9657200	9659240	So I don't think that's possible.
9659240	9660240	All right.
9660240	9663080	I can remember we got to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much for
9663080	9664080	the call.
9664080	9665080	Okay, buddy.
9665080	9666080	Oh, later.
9666080	9667080	Have fun simming.
9667080	9668080	All right.
9668080	9669360	Thanks so much guys for the calls tonight.
9669360	9671080	Apologies to those that didn't get through.
9671080	9673120	Uh, we had a lot of stuff going on tonight though.
9673120	9677040	So, uh, again, you can always send us an email and tweets and all that good stuff.
9677040	9678040	Please do.
9678040	9679480	Uh, many ways to interact with orange launch radio.
9679480	9680840	We always appreciate it.
9680840	9681840	All right.
9681840	9684520	Let's go around and, uh, wrap up any other last minute stories.
9684520	9686440	I cut Loki off for that call.
9686440	9687440	That's all right.
9687440	9688440	Uh, pump it up.
9688440	9691800	Fiesta has been unveiled to be coming out March, 2010.
9691800	9696800	This is the brand new, um, upgrade for pump it up.
9696800	9700320	This would happen to some of the folks behind in the groove are now with like the pump it
9700320	9701320	up folks.
9701320	9702320	I don't know.
9702320	9704400	That's what I thought happened.
9704400	9710640	Apparently though, uh, uh, Fiesta will, um, strengthen the intermediate steps for a pump
9710640	9715280	lovers, uh, mania and newly improved easy steps for beginners.
9715280	9719120	Players also have the option of versus mode in Fiesta.
9719120	9724600	Uh, let's see, uh, separated interfaces to better accommodate general players and pump
9724600	9726620	lovers from the start.
9726620	9730280	Users can play one of the custom made steps by using a USB.
9730280	9733060	So custom sets, kind of cool.
9733060	9739260	And uh, this is compatible with both a personal USB and pump USB, whatever that I imagine
9739260	9740840	they're all about the same anyways.
9740840	9742600	Go have a Fiesta with pump it up Fiesta.
9742600	9746160	They do have a partial song list out of Siesta.
9746160	9750040	I'm trying to see if there's anything other than Banya stuff on here.
9750040	9757440	Uh, Oh, good old Banya tons of Banya, uh, Banya production stuff.
9757440	9762760	They did a remake of a Turkey March, I guess Turkey that's been in, that's been in pump
9762760	9763760	forever.
9763760	9764760	Yeah.
9764760	9768360	Uh, a lot of remakes and remixes in there.
9768360	9769360	That's kinda cool.
9769360	9771840	Um, all right.
9771840	9773760	And I'm getting corrected in chat.
9773760	9774760	That's pump it up.
9774760	9780800	Pro says AJ mix and a Y Y R says pump it pro two is not the same thing as Fiesta.
9780800	9782840	So I guess there's two different pumps series.
9782840	9783840	Okay.
9783840	9784840	I kind of lost track.
9784840	9785840	Sorry guys.
9785840	9787680	Let's go, Oh, he, he, it's the five panel game.
9787680	9789800	I that's, that's how much I know of pump.
9789800	9790800	Sorry.
9790800	9791800	No offense to the community.
9791800	9796320	Even though the game just came out last week, a new line cinema has a option, the rights
9796320	9801040	for the film adaptation of heavy rain, even though the game plays out pretty much like
9801040	9811160	a film anyways, I guess I could see that, uh, and then that's pretty much all I wanted
9811160	9812160	to talk about.
9812160	9813160	All right.
9813160	9817960	Well, that's going to bring us to the close of a show, but not until we go around and
9817960	9819240	get everybody's final thought.
9819240	9823280	But first let me say a big thank you to everybody of course, for tuning in and supporting orange
9823280	9825600	lounge radio and supporting independent podcasting.
9825600	9828120	Um, you know, we don't really make any money off the show.
9828120	9829320	In fact, we pay to do it.
9829320	9832760	Uh, so we do really appreciate all you guys who help us spread the word.
9832760	9836240	All we ask, just tell, you know, one or two people about the show and help us spread the
9836240	9837240	word.
9837240	9840800	And of course we always do love, love, uh, when people post kind reviews of us out on
9840800	9847320	the internet, whether it be on, um, uh, iTunes or whether it be on, you know, what are the
9847320	9850640	other big sites that are out there, podcast alley or what have you, wherever you choose
9850640	9851640	to post it.
9851640	9852640	We really appreciate it.
9852640	9855760	So thank you guys so much for all the kind words about us on the internet.
9855760	9856760	Okay.
9856760	9858280	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
9858280	9859760	We'll start with a Loki tonight.
9859760	9861560	Loki, what's your final thought.
9861560	9867520	I can't wait to go home and install hyper spin 1.0 into my cabinets and finally drop
9867520	9871520	down that list of games so I can actually play some stuff.
9871520	9874000	My final thought is itchy.
9874000	9875000	Yes.
9875000	9876000	Dark Sakura.
9876000	9877000	Tasty.
9877000	9879000	That's your final thought?
9879000	9880000	Tasty.
9880000	9881000	You said itchy.
9881000	9882000	I said tasty.
9882000	9883000	All right.
9883000	9884000	There you go.
9884000	9885000	Itchy and scratchy.
9885000	9886000	I know.
9886000	9887000	I know.
9887000	9888000	I know.
9888000	9889000	I know.
9889000	9890000	And Jill.
9890000	9891000	Yeah, I get it.
9891000	9892000	You don't want to end up a Jill sandwich.
9892000	9893000	Anyhow.
9893000	9894000	Thank you guys so much.
