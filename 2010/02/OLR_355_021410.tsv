0	19520	The X-10 event brings us a barrage of Xbox news.
19520	24080	You'll see less Guitar Hero in 2010 and what new video game is getting a movie screenplay
24080	31200	written for it.
31200	35560	Hello everybody out there and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35560	38920	It's the show where every gamer has a voice.
38920	40480	My name is Rob Roberts.
40480	45960	We'll be talking to you over the next few hours here live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
45960	53200	Joining me as she does every week, say hello to the one and only, Dark Sakura.
53200	54800	I hate that noise more than anything.
54800	55800	You know that, right?
55800	56800	I love that noise.
56800	57800	You do that just to make me mad.
57800	60360	Also, just so you know, Jamie's a little sick tonight.
60360	61360	So- In the head.
61360	63000	Well, that's a given.
63000	64000	That's always.
64000	65000	That's like your thing.
65000	66000	I've had the crap.
66000	67000	Right.
67000	70200	But you're not like coughing and sounding plague-y, you're just, your voice is a little
70200	71200	eh.
71200	75280	Yeah, it's basically been the kind of cold that kicks your ass and saps your energy.
75280	80000	So you might be hearing a little less of Jamie tonight, so thank God, no I'm kidding.
80000	81000	Bite my ass.
81000	82000	Hearts.
82000	83160	But I am busy.
83160	85600	Yeah, she's knitting over there and having fun.
85600	86600	Crocheting.
86600	87600	Crocheting, I'm sorry.
87600	88600	There's a difference, right?
88600	91040	It's a double half crochet, to be specific.
91040	93760	Also say hello to somebody who probably doesn't know the difference between crocheting and
93760	94760	knitting.
94760	97200	Tech master, Loki.
97200	98200	Maybe I do.
98200	99200	Oh, maybe.
99200	100200	Oh, do you?
100200	101200	Okay, guess.
101200	102200	What's the difference?
102200	104200	The difference between crocheting and knitting?
104200	107120	Here's your clue.
107120	108760	Just the tools used to do it?
108760	110080	I really don't care.
110080	111080	Yes.
111080	112460	Anyhow.
112460	114880	What is this, a video game podcast or a show about knitting?
114880	115880	I don't know.
115880	117160	Maybe that's a spinoff show you should have there on soccer.
117160	119000	I am sending a hat to one of our listeners.
119000	120280	I know you're doing a comic show.
120280	122100	To our friend Rob.
122100	123100	Not this Rob.
123100	124100	Not you.
124100	125100	You're making me a scarf.
125100	126100	I'm making you the gayest scarf ever.
126100	127100	I want a rainbow Doctor Who scarf.
127100	128100	That's what I asked for.
128100	129100	It'd be fun.
129100	130100	Alright, hi.
130100	131100	Who cares?
131100	134400	We're here, of course, every week live Sunday nights, 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time right
134400	136980	after the Bobby Black Wolf show live at All Games Radio.
136980	139780	Big thanks to them for letting us steal their bandwidth every week.
139780	141280	It's www.allgames.com.
141280	146520	If you want to check out our own website and our show archives, you can head over to www.orangeloungeradio.com.
146520	150920	Tonight we're going to start off the show as we always do with a little bit of how was
150920	152720	your gaming week.
152720	155440	Dark Sakura, I know her voice is kind of bugging her.
155440	158480	I'll go to her anyway and ask how our gaming week was.
158480	159800	Or better yet, you know what?
159800	161080	I bet I could guess.
161080	163960	I'm going to do my impersonation of Dark Sakura's gaming week.
163960	164960	You ready?
164960	165960	Right.
165960	166960	Okay.
166960	171980	First off, I played Star Trek Online and I saw some Borg and it was cool.
171980	173320	I didn't find any Borg.
173320	174320	I fought the Gorn.
174320	176680	Then I watched my husband play a first person shooter.
176680	177680	No.
177680	180400	But it made me sick, so I decided to play Peggle.
180400	181400	Peggle!
181400	183400	No, I haven't played any Peggle.
183400	184400	I found a fuck.
184400	185400	I thought that was pretty good, Loki.
185400	186400	I don't...
186400	189240	Why do you sound like Clarence from Wonder Shosen?
189240	190240	I don't know.
190240	193760	What are you running from?
193760	195120	I did play Star Trek Online.
195120	196120	Of course you did.
196120	198120	I did shoot the Gorn, not the Borg.
198120	199480	The Gorn of the Lizard People.
199480	200480	Oh, okay.
200480	202320	And it was excellent.
202320	208480	And then I played Solitaire on my iPhone and did not play Peggle.
208480	214480	I found a Flash version of Bust-a-Move, or Puzzle Bobble.
214480	218520	And then we got out some obscure game system from the vault and hooked it up and played
218520	219520	it.
219520	220520	No.
220520	221520	We played Chrono Trigger.
221520	222520	I'm sorry.
222520	228480	We played Super Nintendo, and Dan was playing Ninja Gaiden 3, because we have the Ninja
228480	230960	Gaiden trilogy on this mess.
230960	231960	I'm sorry.
231960	233960	How dare I say an obscure game?
233960	235360	Rob.
235360	237480	What?
237480	240040	Love you, mean it.
240040	241720	You did bring me coffee, so I forgive you.
241720	242720	All right.
242720	243720	Do you want to try and do my gaming week?
243720	246240	Do you want to try and do my gaming week?
246240	247240	Well!
247240	248240	Pretty close.
248240	249240	Pretty close.
249240	250240	Let's go to Loki next, though.
250240	251240	How was your gaming week, Loki?
251240	255560	I just played lots of Grand Theft Auto.
255560	256560	Actually it was funny.
256560	261600	I didn't run into him, but my co-workers ran into somebody that was actually cheating.
261600	266320	Like they had their console modded in a modded version of the game, and they were cheating
266320	267320	that way.
267320	272320	But granted, we could do that again, but I just don't want to have to have all these
272320	274560	banned consoles sitting around, you know?
274560	275560	Sorry.
275560	276560	Can I just say in chat?
276560	279920	Of course, I haven't given them a shout out yet, but we always welcome our chatters every
279920	280920	week.
280920	284160	You can go to OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to join us live on this Sunday evening.
284160	286880	If you're listening via the podcast, there's other ways you can interact with us.
286880	291280	Our Twitter feed at OLR, our Facebook at OrangeLoungeRadio, or of course our mailbag.
291280	292280	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
292280	296500	VidPower's live in our chat tonight and says, do Loki next.
296500	299800	Play GTA IV then worked on Arcade Cabinet.
299800	301240	That would be the Loki impersonation.
301240	303880	No, that's about right.
303880	304880	No.
304880	311560	So we, I watched him play this guy, and you know, it was just stupid, but still winning.
311560	322680	I actually, I think I'm now in the 80s for, what was it, the true skill rank in a single
322680	324000	death match.
324000	325740	So that's kind of cool.
325740	328840	So top 80 players of the world.
328840	336400	And then in just the cumulative death match ranks, I'm about to break 200.
336400	340380	So I'll be in the top 200 there, which is cool.
340380	344920	And I still frustrate my coworkers a lot because I win all the time.
344920	345920	That's okay.
345920	347000	You frustrate your co-hosts too.
347000	348000	That's all right.
348000	350200	That's not because I win all the time.
350200	354560	And then I played more Borderlands, so that was fun.
354560	357560	And just kind of working a little bit through that.
357560	362800	And download the two expansions for that, so hopefully I'll play those soon.
362800	366800	And then finally, did work on my Arcade Cabinet.
366800	374080	I replaced the graphics card that was in there with a much faster one, and much better one.
374080	378560	Because before I had an Arcade VGA card, because they were meant to output to an Arcade Cabinet.
378560	384040	Well, you can do it with other graphics cards, but you have to run a special driver to do
384040	385040	it.
385040	386040	And so I did that.
386040	388640	And it finally took me forever to get the work right.
388640	392080	But now I can play my Niomi games full speed.
392080	398360	I can play Street Fighter IV full speed.
398360	405160	The only thing I can't play full speed right now, that I really wish I could, was my Taito
405160	406440	X games.
406440	411760	Like BlazBlue Continuum Shift is still kind of slow, so I would need to get a slightly
411760	415920	newer graphics card to get that one to work just right.
415920	416920	I think.
416920	421120	Because the one I have right now, the graphics card is only 64-bit, which I should have bought
421120	424920	a newer one, but whatever.
424920	426920	So most of it works.
426920	427920	Alright.
427920	429920	Anything else you want to add?
429920	431920	Nope, that's it.
431920	432920	Alright.
432920	437080	Let's see, DarkSakura was kind of right when she was doing the impersonation of me there.
437080	441200	I did play a little bit of WoW this week, still leveling the characters.
441200	444400	You know what my payback is going to be for poking fun at DarkSakura.
444400	445640	Not making fun, poking fun.
445640	448920	I tease because I love, I'm going to catch whatever she has, so I'm going to be here
448920	449920	next week.
449920	451760	Oh come on, let's watch radio.
451760	455460	No, you're going to be laid up for three days, not able to get out of bed.
455460	458960	And that'll suck because I'm supposed to move next week into my new place, so I really don't
458960	459960	want to get sick.
459960	465560	Remember, remember, friends help friends move, real friends help friends move bodies.
465560	466560	Alright.
466560	467560	Anyhow, let's see.
467560	469440	I put the fun in Dysfunction.
469440	470640	My game week.
470640	472380	Not just WoW, I did play some other stuff too.
472380	476960	Although I did ding 37, I'm almost 38.
476960	478400	Anyhow, on my warrior.
478400	480680	Has to be said in a row.
480680	481680	Shut up.
481680	484480	Let's see, other games I played this week, because I did play some other stuff.
484480	488320	Okay, you remember last week on the show, if you listened to last week's show, I was
488320	492880	squeaking all over the place because Blaster Master Overdrive was coming out on the Wii.
492880	498640	Which is, you know, this sequel, if you will, to the original Blaster Master on the NES.
498640	501560	You know, of course there was a version on the Genesis and Game Boy as well, but we're
501560	504040	just kind of, I guess, assuming those didn't happen.
504040	505400	And this kind of came out of nowhere.
505400	510520	It was released this week on WiiWare, and so of course Monday I go home from work, automatically
510520	514160	download this thing right away, and I spend a little time with it, and I'm sure everybody
514160	517320	wants to know my thoughts because I was so excited and I was happy about it last week,
517320	524240	and so I played it, and well, I guess maybe I overhyped it a little bit.
524240	525240	It wasn't all that.
525240	528760	Well, here's the thing, it wasn't bad.
528760	532560	It just wasn't what I thought it could have been.
532560	536800	A couple things I noticed right off the bat is that it did not support 16.9.
536800	540360	It was, it still had the black bars on the left and right side of the screen on my widescreen
540360	541400	TV.
541400	544960	The controls were a little weird, like I know the vehicle is supposed to control a little
544960	549480	odd, but I felt like they overcompensated in the Blaster Master game.
549480	552480	One of the things that kind of bugged me is I felt the different stages didn't have a
552480	556720	lot of differentness between them.
556720	559360	There wasn't a lot of uniqueness between the levels.
559360	563640	One level was cave, and it had brown walls, and one level was outdoors, but you go into
563640	565080	a cave right away.
565080	569180	The other level was like ice cave, and you have blue walls, and when you go into the
569180	571720	overhead areas, they're not that exciting.
571720	578360	They look like the dungeons from the 8-bit Willow on the NES, just different variations
578360	584320	of a little maze like that, and I wasn't all that floored with it.
584320	585840	But then you have to look at the other side of it.
585840	587480	The game was only $10.
587480	591080	They did Metroid it a little, like you have save points, you have maps, I don't like the
591080	596240	way they did save points because only certain caves have save points, and sometimes you
596240	602320	don't want to drive around for 20 minutes looking for a save point.
602320	606600	I wasn't as thrilled with the save system as I guess I could have been, but then again,
606600	610160	you think back, a lot of old games you'd have to look around a while for a save system.
610160	612840	You know what kind of weirded me out about Blaster Master Overdrive?
612840	614400	Here's the thing about the game.
614400	618860	I kind of felt like I was playing a game, and I really give this a lot of thought because
618860	620720	how did they turn this around so quick?
620720	627200	I felt like I was playing a game that had been made for another system and then finished
627200	628200	for the Wii.
628200	635160	I seriously think what I played was made for the PS1 or PS2, and then for whatever reason
635160	639000	it didn't happen, it came out on the Wii instead.
639000	640320	That's what the game kind of felt like to me.
640320	646080	It felt like a mediocre PS1 game just suddenly now on the Wii.
646080	651760	But again, the value, $10, the music kicks ass, a lot of the remixes are really cool,
651760	654480	and there is that nostalgia factor.
654480	658680	My only other big bitch, and this is damn near a game-ruiner for me, this is why I can't
658680	662980	play Blaster Master Overdrive for long periods of time, the controls blow.
662980	669920	They absolutely blow, and it's one really logical flaw that makes it blow.
669920	674560	You use your Wiimote tilted to the side like an NES controller, and all the buttons pretty
674560	675560	much are used.
675560	678260	You use the A button, the giant one, to switch weapons.
678260	681520	You use the 1 button to fire your weapon, which makes sense.
681520	686640	You use the 2 button to fire a super weapon, which you do once in a great while, and you
686640	688520	don't want to hit that inadvertently.
688520	692480	And then you use the trigger button on the back of the controller, while you're holding
692480	699960	it like an NES controller, to strafe, which if you want to be very successful in the first-person
699960	703720	or whatever you would call them, it's not even Jason, I think it's Alex now, in the
703720	707200	Alex areas, if you want to be successful, you have to be able to strafe.
707200	711240	And using the trigger button when you're trying to hold it like an NES controller to strafe
711240	712240	sucks.
712240	717020	Like, you're not holding it, like, I don't know who thought that, and that's the first
717020	718020	thing that made me think.
718020	723160	Why can't they just do it the old way, where you would just hold the fire button down,
723160	726320	and then it would just stay firing in that one direction, and you can move around and
726320	729780	strafe, and then you just basically let go of it, and turn, and then hold it down again
729780	731200	to shoot a different direction.
731200	734080	Or just be able to remap the buttons the way I want them.
734080	737320	Like, you know, most games have a options menu with controls.
737320	738840	Well, maybe they'll patch it back in.
738840	739840	Oh wait, they can't, that's right.
739840	740840	Oh wait, no, it's the Wii.
740840	741840	It's the Wii.
741840	743680	You can't patch on the Wii, so forget it.
743680	746580	And ActDeft asked, does it have classic controller support in our chat room?
746580	747580	It does not.
747580	750240	You can only, which I thought was a glaring omission too.
750240	756260	You can only play it with the NES controller, or I'm sorry, NES style regular Wiimote tilted
756260	758560	to the side.
758560	759560	The controls blow.
759560	763520	I was really irritated that I couldn't remap it, and that's the first thing that made me
763520	764520	think.
764520	768040	I think someone just brought this over from like PS2, and thank you chat rooms for reminding
768040	771760	me, Dartitsuya said they did release a Blaster Master on PSX, they did.
771760	775720	So I don't know if this was like a sequel that they started to make, or a PS2 version,
775720	776720	I don't know.
776720	780760	Or again, I'm hypothesizing just based on what I played, it didn't feel like it was
780760	784760	made for the Wii, because I think if it was, it would have supported 16.9.
784760	787160	So the controls really kind of ruin it for me.
787160	792680	And it's too bad, because at the end of the day, it still seems like there's a fun game
792680	797840	in there somewhere, and for $10 it's still not a terrible deal, it's just I would urge
797840	801040	you to go spend your money on the original, honestly.
801040	802040	That's what I'd do.
802040	803760	So that was Blaster Master Overdrive.
803760	809320	Other stuff I played this week, Castle Crashers, randomly, for some reason that game came out
809320	814600	what, almost a year ago, and I'm just now getting around to playing it, for real.
814600	819380	Spent some time playing that game in two-player local mode, and the only problem I have with
819380	822940	it is that sometimes it gets to be a little bit monotonous, as all of those old games
822940	827840	like the Ninja Turtles game, and the games that's based off of Final Fight and all that
827840	830040	do, it's just, you know, kick, punch, punch, kick, kick.
830040	832480	But I gotta say, that's like the only negative I can think of.
832480	837200	I think, as far as Castle Crashers goes, I love how they have all these little in-jokes
837200	840960	and they really souped it up, and they added some things into it, like, you know, fighting
840960	845800	each other to see who can kiss the girl, and the little power-ups, and the magic.
845800	850320	You know, I think they did definitely take that genre of gaming to the next level.
850320	854240	So I was, you know, definitely Castle Crashers is a good buy, if you haven't already bought
854240	858400	it, I mean, it's like, what, the best-selling Xbox 360 arcade game, so I imagine most of
858400	859400	you own it.
859400	863880	I'm slow in getting around to some games, okay?
863880	869000	And then, I didn't really play a whole lot else in depth, but I watched my boyfriend
869000	873080	play tons of games because he got a brand new monitor this week that's like a 25-inch
873080	877440	monitor, it's huge, it's very similar to Dan's monitor, it's gigantic, and I just watched
877440	882880	him play, like, Left 4 Dead 2 and Half-Life 2, like, every neat-looking game he owned,
882880	886240	he had to load within the scope of, like, two hours, and it was pretty, I will admit,
886240	890480	it was pretty, and you know I played WoW on that thing, too, and it was very pretty, very
890480	891480	pretty.
891480	896560	Anyhow, that's about it for our gaming weeks, so we're gonna move on, we'll get into some
896560	899200	news here in just a moment, but first, we want to take some housekeeping.
899200	903120	It is Valentine's Day, so for those that are celebrating Valentine's Day, happy Valentine's
903120	904760	Day, hope it was a good one.
904760	908840	For those that aren't, well, take a moment to celebrate what you really love today, video
908840	909840	games.
909840	914040	Join our chat, chat.orangelandrado.com, and talk about the latest in gaming news this
914040	917800	week with us, and of course our Twitter and all that other stuff as well that I mentioned
917800	918800	earlier.
918800	920720	Okay, let's get into some actual news tonight.
920720	923120	X10 event, lots of news, right, Loki?
923120	930280	Yes, lots of interesting news, some of which was being covered by, well, about Dead Rising
930280	936480	2, which they announced will be coming out August 31st in the US, and then coming out
936480	943520	later on in Japan and Europe later this week on the 2nd and 3rd of September.
943520	950280	And if you remember, I mean, the original Dead Rising came out, I think, 07 or 08, around
950280	954480	the same time, I know it was in August, but that's pretty cool.
954480	958200	And then some of the stuff they were also showing off about it, apparently, of course,
958200	963440	since this, you know, being X10, they announced that they're going to have an exclusive to
963440	972520	Xbox Live, Dead Rising 2 K0, which is a prologue to the sequel of the game, and will kind of
972520	975080	work as a game add-on.
975080	979300	And not only that, it's basically going to be the demo for the game.
979300	984920	So you'll get to kind of get your Dead Rising on slightly earlier than the game actually
984920	985920	comes out.
985920	987700	Well, now, Loki, demos are usually free.
987700	990320	And I'm guessing this is not going to be free.
990320	992720	Um, maybe, yeah.
992720	994480	Well, okay, maybe.
994480	998240	I mean, maybe I'm not giving enough credit, I mean, if it's just going to be a giant advertisement
998240	1001520	for the game, maybe it will be free, who knows, but I just kind of doubt it.
1001520	1002520	I don't know why.
1002520	1003520	I'm being skeptical.
1003520	1004840	You never know.
1004840	1006840	History shows this kind of crap is usually not free.
1006840	1010440	Oh, we have a special guest here on tonight's show.
1010440	1011440	Hold on.
1011440	1012440	Say hi.
1012440	1013440	This is...
1013440	1014440	No.
1014440	1015440	Who's our special guest tonight?
1015440	1016440	This is Julian.
1016440	1017840	Wait, we can't hear in the mic.
1017840	1018840	This is Julian.
1018840	1019840	Hi, Julian.
1019840	1020840	How old is Julian?
1020840	1021840	He's two.
1021840	1024380	Julian's two and has the best shoes in the world.
1024380	1025380	They're lighting up.
1025380	1026380	Julian, sit up.
1026380	1029240	Do you like video games, Julian?
1029240	1030240	He says no.
1030240	1032040	Tell them in the microphone.
1032040	1033040	Do you like games?
1033040	1034040	No.
1034040	1039840	Well, then, I don't know if we're going to be able to talk too much on the show tonight.
1039840	1041840	Do you want mommy?
1041840	1045600	Do you like to play the guitar?
1045600	1046600	I think he's afraid of the microphone.
1046600	1048760	Oh, no, he's not afraid of the microphone.
1048760	1050240	He's just being obstinate.
1050240	1051760	He's being too.
1051760	1054400	All right, anyhow, sorry, Loki.
1054400	1055400	Go ahead, Dead Rising.
1055400	1056400	Okay.
1056400	1062640	So, Dead Rising, case zero, should be coming out shortly before the release of Dead Rising
1062640	1063640	2.
1063640	1064640	So, expect it this summer.
1064640	1065640	That's Rob.
1065640	1066640	All right.
1066640	1070280	It will have achievements and all that good stuff, though, right?
1070280	1071280	Yes.
1071280	1076440	You know what would make a good, by the way, we have comments in chat room, chat.orangeonstrader.com.
1076440	1080040	Black Wolf in chat, our good pal, Bobby Black Wolf, who's on before us every Sunday at All
1080040	1086320	Games Radio, says, Julian, sounds like the ferret.
1086320	1088320	We need to get him to say, excuse me.
1088320	1089320	All right.
1089320	1091440	No, he's the one to look in the garage.
1091440	1093600	Because that's where all the pinball machines are, huh?
1093600	1094600	He loves the garage.
1094600	1095600	Of course.
1095600	1096600	Of course he does.
1096600	1097600	All right.
1097600	1098600	He's a boy.
1098600	1099600	Sorry.
1099600	1100600	We let a two-year-old derail the show, but that happens.
1100600	1101600	He doesn't like games, though.
1101600	1102600	I know.
1102600	1104920	No, he goes back there and watches his dad play on his Xbox all the time.
1104920	1105920	He just doesn't.
1105920	1106920	His dad's playing Mass Effect 2.
1106920	1108120	He doesn't like the nerds playing this show.
1108120	1110120	He just has to get used to everybody.
1110120	1111120	I know, I know.
1111120	1112120	He's like a cat.
1112120	1113120	He's got to warm up, too, a little bit.
1113120	1114440	Okay, so, anyway, back to Dead Rising.
1114440	1119200	You know, what I think would be an interesting kind of demo is, I heard this kind of like
1119200	1120200	as a rumor.
1120200	1121200	I don't know if this is true or not.
1121200	1122280	Loki, maybe you've read up on this.
1122280	1125440	I heard they took the picture-taking thing out of Dead Rising 2.
1125440	1126440	That's not part of the game now.
1126440	1127440	That is not part of the game.
1127440	1129720	Well, wouldn't that make like a neat little download thing?
1129720	1135080	Like I took pictures of zombies or something like, you know, Dead Rising Snap.
1135080	1137660	No, I don't know.
1137660	1142600	Maybe if it came, well, it's been on the Wii, so maybe they could do a version of that,
1142600	1144040	like on the Wii.
1144040	1148800	But no, I don't know if that, I mean, it'll be fun, because I remember I played the first
1148800	1154880	Dead Rising demo a lot, because it was like a 15-minute demo or something like that or,
1154880	1159040	you know, a pretty decent-sized demo and you could just run around killing zombies and
1159040	1160040	that's it.
1160040	1163040	Same thing with Saints Row, the 15-minute, or it was the 30-minute demo for that, and
1163040	1165880	I think Crackdown had that, too.
1165880	1169960	But those are really good demos, and so, you know, if it's like a prologue to the game
1169960	1174440	and with some additional content, yeah, I'll check it out, definitely.
1174440	1175880	So I mean, Dead Rising's awesome, so.
1175880	1177480	Yeah, I mean, I enjoyed Dead Rising, too.
1177480	1179160	It was kind of a pleasant little surprise.
1179160	1182000	So I'm kind of curious where they're going to go with the sequel.
1182000	1183720	I like the picture-taking thing, though.
1183720	1186440	That was the whole opening of the first game, was like taking pictures, wasn't it?
1186440	1188280	Yeah, but see, he's not a journalist this time.
1188280	1193280	This time, he's like, you know, a duct tape expert, because, you know, that's...
1193280	1194480	Is that an actual job?
1194480	1195480	You can like...
1195480	1199200	What would you study in college to become a duct tape expert?
1199200	1202600	Fusion, I would imagine.
1202600	1204880	All right.
1204880	1208520	Let's move on to some other Xbox Live-related news, and this has to do with some of the
1208520	1211920	other things that were teased at the X10 event.
1211920	1216400	For example, instead of doing a Summer of Arcade this year, I shouldn't say instead
1216400	1219600	of, they'll probably still do the Summer of Arcade, they're going to do what's called
1219600	1224560	a block party in the month of March, and that's what Xbox Live is going to be doing.
1224560	1229320	The first game that's going to come out on March 3rd is called Toy Soldiers.
1229320	1233520	Scrap Metal is coming out as well, as well as Perfect Dark.
1233520	1236440	That's right, they're going to do a remake of Perfect Dark, and that's coming out on
1236440	1241880	Xbox Live Arcade this March, and also, kind of coming out of nowhere, Game Room is coming
1241880	1242880	out.
1242880	1245400	It has been confirmed that that will come out in March, so at least we have a target
1245400	1246400	date for that.
1246400	1251080	I'm guessing, just kind of out of the blue, though, that will be the last week of March.
1251080	1253840	That's going to be the big last thing.
1253840	1254840	What's getting the last slot?
1254840	1255840	Or Perfect Dark?
1255840	1258400	One of the two is probably getting the last slot.
1258400	1259720	I don't know.
1259720	1267760	I had to say I got to watch a little video of the Perfect Dark playthrough, and it was...
1267760	1269360	Can you jump in this one?
1269360	1270360	I believe.
1270360	1271360	I saw him jumping.
1271360	1272600	It's just a remake of the N64 one.
1272600	1274120	Well, you can't jump in the...
1274120	1275120	I don't know.
1275120	1277880	Well, by the way, some of the price is already out for some of those as well.
1277880	1280920	Perfect Dark will set you back $10, 800 Microsoft points.
1280920	1285160	Toy Soldiers and Scrap Metal, $15 a piece, that's 1,200 Microsoft points.
1285160	1289680	Of course, Game Room is free to download, but it will cost $3 if you want to play it
1289680	1297160	on one system, either your 360 or your PC, 400 Microsoft points or five bucks for both,
1297160	1303120	or 50 cents, 40 Microsoft points for one play, which I always thought it was supposed to
1303120	1308040	be two plays, two quarters for two plays, but I guess they scaled it back to one.
1308040	1309040	So there you go.
1309040	1313080	Those are the prices of the games coming out on Xbox Live in March.
1313080	1314600	So definitely a very busy month.
1314600	1315720	Anything you guys are looking forward to?
1315720	1321120	I mean, I'm all about Game Room as much as I'm a little bit irritated that I've bought
1321120	1323020	a lot of those games before.
1323020	1325080	You know what else I played this week?
1325080	1330880	The other night, I think Alan was playing WoW or something, and I was there hanging
1330880	1333840	out, and I just fired up old Atari 2600 games.
1333840	1335520	I started playing Pitfall 2, The Lost Caverns.
1335520	1339280	I was playing that for a little bit, and then I was playing an old, old game called, and
1339280	1342160	I can't remember the name now, Dragon Fire, I think it was called.
1342160	1344520	It was, there was two modes to it.
1344520	1348240	One was where you were running across the drawbridge and you had to dodge the fireballs,
1348240	1352280	and then the second screen was you had to collect all the treasure and dodge the fireballs
1352280	1353280	from the dragon.
1353280	1355840	I think it's called Dragon Fire.
1355840	1358000	I played those games for like an hour.
1358000	1359540	It's crazy.
1359540	1362520	So I'm all about Game Room and playing some of the classic games again, as long as it's
1362520	1368160	not stuff I've already bought, so I won't be buying Scramble, thank you very much, or
1368160	1371360	Frogger, or Tempest, or anything else that's already been on Xbox Live.
1371360	1381040	I'm not buying Frogger just despite Frogger, because I hate the just incessant whoring
1381040	1382560	out of Frogger.
1382560	1385200	Konami, get a new game to whore out, seriously.
1385200	1389200	It's not Frogger itself, the classic game that you have a problem with, it's the incessant
1389200	1390760	whoring of the franchise and what has become.
1390760	1393640	They have made me hate the original game of Frogger now.
1393640	1397920	Well, I remember when they first came out with that Frogger game on PS1, it was awesome.
1397920	1402040	Like that first Frogger revival game was awesome when it first came out, but then it's like,
1402040	1405080	that's all they make now.
1405080	1407960	So I don't know.
1407960	1409440	But the original Frogger's okay.
1409440	1413440	My favorite Frogger, Hello Random, was on the Commodore 64.
1413440	1418720	It was called Frogger 2 3 Deep, and it was three different screens.
1418720	1422160	You had a sky screen, and a ground screen, and an underwater screen.
1422160	1427380	And you could go between the three screens, or you could dock your frog at the end of
1427380	1428800	one particular screen.
1428800	1429800	It was weird.
1429800	1431320	You know what?
1431320	1437720	My memories of Frogger were of being in fourth grade on roller skates playing at the skating
1437720	1440600	rink in Dothan, Alabama.
1440600	1442960	There was a roller rink in Roseville, California that I used to go to.
1442960	1443960	I think it's still there.
1443960	1444960	It's called Roller King.
1444960	1446920	I used to play Spy Hunter in the arcade there.
1446920	1456080	They had that same Frogger machine for at least ten years, and I would play it every
1456080	1458480	summer on roller skates.
1458480	1461640	Lots of Frogger hate in our chat room, chat.orangehonker.com.
1461640	1467120	Ray Ayanami says Frogger sucks, Spyro says Frogger is scary, ToaGak says Frogger go get
1467120	1468120	hit by a car.
1468120	1473960	To this day though, I play Frogger best on roller skates on an arcade machine.
1473960	1478000	I play Spy Hunter best on roller skates, which always fascinated me because it had a gas
1478000	1479000	pedal on those machines.
1479000	1480000	I'm sure the roller skates did not.
1480000	1482560	I would like to see Frogger Shattered Soldier.
1482560	1483560	The funniest thing I ever saw.
1483560	1484560	With the Kiriyamaoka doing that.
1484560	1489080	I think this was in Chico, at a roller rink in Chico, California where I went to school
1489080	1490080	for college.
1490080	1494280	They had a DDR machine in a roller rink, and the first time I ever saw that I was like,
1494280	1496640	you know something bad is going to happen on that machine.
1496640	1501800	Some idgits gonna hop up on there and try to play in roller skates.
1501800	1504360	Now Hitstun is showing the other side of the spectrum here.
1504360	1505360	One other comment about Frogger.
1505360	1508240	I don't know how we got on this tangent and then we'll go to Dark Sakura with another
1508240	1509240	news story.
1509240	1512280	But Hitstun gives another side of the token here.
1512280	1517000	Frogger is a great first video game for kids.
1517000	1518000	That's a valid argument.
1518000	1519920	I think it's a good kid video game.
1519920	1520920	Loki?
1520920	1524720	Do you think he has a point?
1524720	1528920	They want to turn him off of video games because they're going to frustrate the hell out of
1528920	1530600	them.
1530600	1534120	I can look at it as an educational tool for hand-eye coordination.
1534120	1535120	You want a good first kid?
1535120	1536120	No, if you think about it-
1536120	1538400	It's a classic excuse we use with our parents.
1538400	1541080	Mother, I'm working on my hand-eye coordination.
1541080	1542080	The best idling-
1542080	1543080	Go on.
1543080	1544080	Dark Sakura, sorry.
1544080	1549660	But you're dealing with the concept of objects in motion.
1549660	1555880	So honestly, and I've actually found a study on this a few years ago where they were talking
1555880	1561080	about games like Frogger as being ones that teach about physics in motion.
1561080	1562080	So-
1562080	1565480	Well, but couldn't you learn hand-eye coordination from Street Fighter IV?
1565480	1568520	You know, let the kid get his butt kicked a little.
1568520	1573360	But it's the whole point of things moving in opposite directions of, you know, horizontal
1573360	1577200	versus vertical movement, you know, spatial relations.
1577200	1579160	All right, fine.
1579160	1584860	Azure Edge, in chat, by the way, jumped in and said Battle Toads was his first game.
1584860	1586000	It's a game that gets you-
1586000	1587000	There's a game.
1587000	1588000	Sick of-
1588000	1589000	I can already tell you what mine was.
1589000	1590000	Pong.
1590000	1591000	Oh, of course.
1591000	1592640	And then kangaroo.
1592640	1596880	I don't remember what my first first game was, but I have really early memories of playing
1596880	1597880	combat.
1597880	1601980	It was probably combat when the family got an Atari 2600 and Spider-Man.
1601980	1605220	I remember going in my mom's bedroom where the Atari 2600 was hooked up so that she could
1605220	1608000	limit my play time to play Spider-Man.
1608000	1613240	We always had crypt equip at my friend's house because we had an Odyssey 2.
1613240	1619320	Now when I was- the first system that I think I owned myself, that and then just given to
1619320	1622440	me, but one that was bought for me, was my ColecoVision.
1622440	1626060	We played a lot of Turbo and Mouse Trap, Adventure and Gorf.
1626060	1627960	I always wanted a ColecoVision, but my mother-
1627960	1628960	I think I have two.
1628960	1632200	My mother wouldn't give me one because she says we have an Atari 2600, we don't need
1632200	1633200	the other one.
1633200	1634200	Which, you know, she made a point.
1634200	1636200	The ColecoVision, I'm sorry, was far superior.
1636200	1637200	All right.
1637200	1641000	Especially since I had the expansion module that you could play Atari 2600 games on.
1641000	1645520	Plus once we got the Commodore 64, that's really all I played for years and years.
1645520	1648440	I didn't even touch the 2600 anymore, it was all about the Commodore 64, that thing was
1648440	1649440	awesome.
1649440	1650440	What was it?
1650440	1651440	The TI-85?
1651440	1652440	Nice.
1652440	1653440	Yeah.
1653440	1654440	Okay.
1654440	1655440	Sorry, let's move on with more gaming news.
1655440	1656440	Okay.
1656440	1657440	Back to- fast forward to now.
1657440	1658440	Sorry.
1658440	1659440	Sorry.
1659440	1660440	I really shouldn't have been talking that much too.
1660440	1661440	That's okay.
1661440	1669440	Well, Halo Reach Beta has a date, it's May 3rd, but only if you already have ODST.
1669440	1677200	At the X10 event, Microsoft made the announcement that the multiplayer beta was going to begin
1677200	1684440	for the ODST owners, so that means you have to actually have the ODST disk to access the
1684440	1685440	beta.
1685440	1687880	So, yay, I have it.
1687880	1690760	Well, yeah, I mean, it makes sense.
1690760	1695240	I mean, the people that are going to want to play Halo Reach right away already have
1695240	1696240	Halo ODST.
1696240	1698200	I mean, it makes sense.
1698200	1701680	I imagine if you're a Halo fan, you know, it's not like they're pairing it with a
1701680	1706800	game like Crackdown, where you have to kind of go outside the genre to pick up this game.
1706800	1709360	Like, remember when the Halo 3 beta came with Crackdown?
1709360	1713720	You had to buy this completely different game to get access to the Halo 3 beta.
1713720	1714720	Crackdown was fun, though.
1714720	1718020	Yeah, although it turned out, I mean, thankfully, Crackdown was a pretty good game, but imagine
1718020	1719360	if it hadn't been.
1719360	1720960	You know, that could have been a bad thing.
1720960	1724120	But it makes sense that they're doing it that way.
1724120	1726960	I have to tell you what the joy of Crackdown was for me.
1726960	1736160	It was coming in the house and having Dan and Will play Crackdown, going, I like jumping!
1736160	1739360	And that little high-pitched voice, I like jumping!
1739360	1740360	I like jumping!
1740360	1741360	Okay.
1741360	1742360	I know.
1742360	1744960	And then it gets stuck in my head.
1744960	1748880	So every time I think about Crackdown, I instantly hear Dan and Will in my head going, I like
1748880	1749880	jumping!
1749880	1752240	Well, you won't have to worry about that when Perfect Dark comes out.
1752240	1753240	So, all right.
1753240	1754240	I like not jumping.
1754240	1756600	Loki, what do you think of the whole Halo thing?
1756600	1760440	I mean, for me, I'm like, oh, darn, I would have liked a free demo that I could download
1760440	1762440	and play, but I can't hate on what they're doing.
1762440	1766800	They did the same thing with Crackdown, of course, they did the same thing.
1766800	1769400	So I'm not surprised that they're doing the same thing with this.
1769400	1776440	So I really don't care, because I didn't play much of the Halo 3 beta, and I just can't
1776440	1778800	see myself playing much of the Halo Reach beta.
1778800	1785080	I mean, Halo Online for me is just not that big.
1785080	1789640	I mean, yeah, no offense, I understand why people love their Halo, but I haven't really
1789640	1795320	been into it myself since Halo 2, which, as we talked about last week, I'm not going to
1795320	1800680	be able to play much longer anyway online, unless, as many folks have speculated, Microsoft
1800680	1807400	does a Halo 2 for the Xbox Live Arcade, like a revival, which wouldn't surprise me at all.
1807400	1813760	But I didn't really get into Halo 3 that much, so I can't see myself getting into these other
1813760	1814760	ones.
1814760	1818280	Even my college buddies call me up and say, Rob, you gotta get Halo Reach so we can all
1818280	1819280	play again.
1819280	1820280	I'd probably do it.
1820280	1821280	We'll see.
1821280	1822280	Let's move on.
1822280	1826640	Loki, you have a lot, a lot of news here, coming from another presser.
1826640	1830160	Yes, EA, they had a bunch of stuff coming out.
1830160	1836040	I want to say it's from their end of the fiscal quarter stuff, and they released their tentative
1836040	1841400	release schedule for fiscal 2011.
1841400	1851960	So running from April, or I guess, yeah, April to April 2011.
1851960	1857440	And of course, some stuff's not a big surprise, you know, sequels to big franchises.
1857440	1864720	One that's already been teased already, Dead Space 2 is slated for early 2011.
1864720	1868640	I didn't really say when, I guess Q4 of 2011.
1868640	1874280	So somewhere between January and March of 2011, you can expect that one to be coming.
1874280	1881640	Of course, on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, I believe they're skipping the PC version
1881640	1883040	this time around.
1883040	1890120	Some other things also been teased before and are coming by holiday of 2010, Crysis
1890120	1894800	2, which was on the cover recently of one of the game magazines, supposed to be taking
1894800	1897020	place in New York.
1897020	1900360	And Sims 3 will be making its way out to consoles.
1900360	1909160	Also NBA Jam coming this holiday, and EA Sports MMA, supposed to be coming out between October
1909160	1912620	and December of 2010 as well.
1912620	1918160	And some other smaller stuff also being put out.
1918160	1922920	Of course, new Harry Potter, tie in with the Deathly Hallows.
1922920	1928560	And those games make money, those Harry Potter games, they make money, and they've only got
1928560	1929560	a little bit left.
1929560	1932440	Actually, they'll probably still find a way to crank out those games even when the games
1932440	1933440	are done.
1933440	1938200	Oh yeah, I can see them doing some, you know, hell, they did Lord of the Rings games for
1938200	1939200	the longest time.
1939200	1941120	They have another Lord of the Rings game coming out.
1941120	1943520	Harry Potter MMO.
1943520	1947000	You know someone wants to do it.
1947000	1948000	It could be Epic.
1948000	1952380	Do a Harry Potter MMO with all the people I know that are like really into the Harry
1952380	1954000	Potter fandom.
1954000	1956840	Just log on to LiveJournal, you'll find tons of people that love Harry Potter.
1956840	1958560	That would get Nellie playing MMOs.
1958560	1965320	I'm telling you, I am kind of shocked there isn't already one talked in development.
1965320	1967560	That'll be the game somebody makes once all the other games are done.
1967560	1972560	That would be awesome, just totally unrealistic and never gonna happen, but wouldn't it be
1972560	1978920	awesome like the next game that Blizzard is developing is Harry Potter MMO.
1978920	1980820	Just like something ridiculous.
1980820	1986560	You know what, if Blizzard were making that, even I would have to play it.
1986560	1990980	I really would, because you know what I've said, Blizzard really doesn't make bad games.
1990980	1995280	They haven't made a bad game in about 25 years, you know, Blizzard doesn't really make bad
1995280	1996280	games.
1996280	2000080	Some other games coming out.
2000080	2006920	Between July 1st and September 30th, the real time world's crime themed MMO, which this
2006920	2013060	will probably get me into MMOs as well, APB, or what I like to call Scenes Bro Grand Theft
2013060	2015320	Auto Online, which would be awesome.
2015320	2022760	And then of course, the next Medal of Honor game, right now slated for the summer as well.
2022760	2029880	Actually, no I take that back, it's sometime between now and March 2011, so anytime I guess
2029880	2032820	for Medal of Honor.
2032820	2037520	And let's see, to kind of go with the more casual crowd, they're gonna be doing some
2037520	2043040	new EA Sports Active games, which are due out around this holiday, and of course it's
2043040	2051720	not surprising, but they're going to be possibly working with the Microsoft Project Natal and
2051720	2054800	the Motion Controller Arc, or whatever the hell they're gonna call it.
2054800	2058120	Those games have been doing pretty well, and I've actually, I gotta say, I played those
2058120	2063440	games myself, and I had a bitch with them, and my bitch was you couldn't skip exercises
2063440	2067920	that the system was not recognizing you as actually doing, due to the limitations of
2067920	2070980	the Wii motion recognition, which ticked me off.
2070980	2074800	That was my one bitch that was almost a game-ruiner for me, but from what I hear of people that
2074800	2080240	are playing it regularly, it's a better workout than Wii Fit, because it's a more organized
2080240	2084800	kind of workout, and they have you do different types of exercises than Wii Fit does.
2084800	2088160	Everything's kind of centered around the board in Wii Fit, whereas they kind of remove that
2088160	2089160	in EA Sports.
2089160	2094480	I mean, granted, they have the ribbon, and you can use the board if you have it, but
2094480	2099880	a common misconception about EA Sports, or EA Active, you do not need the balance board
2099880	2100880	to play it.
2100880	2104440	It comes with the little wrist strap thing that you don't even really use.
2104440	2105440	The resistance bands.
2105440	2109760	Well, yeah, the resistance band, I'm sorry, not the wrist strap, the leg strap.
2109760	2113440	You put this thing on your leg and you put the Wiimote in it, so it senses when you're
2113440	2115380	running a little better.
2115380	2118160	I would rather just have real resistance bands.
2118160	2119400	They are real resistance bands.
2119400	2123560	Well, then that's the only reason I've won it, because that's a better workout.
2123560	2127920	Nothing is going to replace the gym and eating healthier.
2127920	2131720	But it will probably be a little bit better than fake hula hooping on the...
2131720	2132720	Yes, exactly.
2132720	2135480	You know what, though, I think that a great way to lose weight is?
2135480	2136480	Stomach virus.
2136480	2137480	Tape worm.
2137480	2138480	Tape worms, too.
2138480	2140600	Not my favorite way to lose weight.
2140600	2146720	I mean, when I had pancreatitis, I lost like 45 pounds, but I also almost died, which kind
2146720	2147720	of sucks.
2147720	2150720	Tape worms win-win, too, because you probably have to have bad meat in order for that to
2150720	2153320	happen, and very raw meat is delicious.
2153320	2155080	All right.
2155080	2156360	Was that it, or is there more EA?
2156360	2157360	Oh, there's more.
2157360	2158360	Just real quick.
2158360	2162480	Of course, Dragon Age will be getting a sequel in early 2011 as well.
2162480	2166080	Well, now this is important, because Dragon Age was pretty badass.
2166080	2170680	And what's also interesting, though, is it will be making its way out to portables as
2170680	2175000	well, the DS and PSP, or possibly cell phones.
2175000	2176360	And PZ?
2176360	2179880	Epic Dragon Age is very epic, so I'm not surprised at all that there's a sequel.
2179880	2180880	I'm kind of surprised it's coming out.
2180880	2181880	Sequel the successful franchise?
2181880	2182880	No.
2182880	2185200	I'm kind of surprised it's coming out so fast, but there you go.
2185200	2186200	Well, it's not...
2186200	2189360	It's only, what, a year since the last one?
2189360	2191000	Yeah, but this is coming out in 2011.
2191000	2193000	I mean, it'll be over a year.
2193000	2194960	Oh, they didn't say, like, beginning 2011.
2194960	2195960	They said...
2195960	2196960	Well, that's...
2196960	2197960	The first...
2197960	2199960	Okay, 18 months, maybe.
2199960	2201880	It'll probably be the same engine.
2201880	2205840	That's really a long time in the gaming world.
2205840	2206840	I guess.
2206840	2207840	I mean...
2207840	2208840	True.
2208840	2211920	I mean, they've already put out, like, what, at least two of those EA Active games, if
2211920	2214600	not three or four, and there's gonna be even more, but still.
2214600	2220480	I mean, that's like, yeah, it's like a one-tenth of a Duke Nukem Forever.
2220480	2223280	All I'm saying is that, you know, they just make sure you take the time to get it right.
2223280	2224280	That's all.
2224280	2227040	Mass Effect 1 and 2 probably had a similar gap between them, right?
2227040	2231000	Mass Effect 1 and 2 is probably, what, about 18 months, or maybe two years, right?
2231000	2232720	Maybe somebody in chat knows better.
2232720	2239140	And Mass Effect 1, I believe, was November 08, and so, yeah, it's about the same.
2239140	2243520	There's people out there proclaiming Mass Effect 2 is the greatest video game ever made, period.
2243520	2247080	It's supposed to be better because it's, you know, the combat's a lot better.
2247080	2250120	It actually looks interesting, but I'm not gonna buy it because...
2250120	2253920	Well, it's on my to playlist, but I gotta be honest with y'all.
2253920	2259820	I have been a Final Fantasy fanboy since the very, very first one that, you know, my friend
2259820	2263440	and I used the strategy guide made by Nintendo Power to get through.
2263440	2265140	I will be buying Final Fantasy XIII.
2265140	2268160	You probably won't hear me talk about anything but that until I beat it.
2268160	2270160	Oh, yeah.
2270160	2271160	Anyhow.
2271160	2277240	Of course, that didn't really happen with Final Fantasy XII, but I blame XII a whole
2277240	2279960	... XII should not have been on the PS2, but that's for another day.
2279960	2283360	Go back and listen to old episodes if you wanna know more thoughts on that.
2283360	2284360	All right.
2284360	2285360	So, I don't know.
2285360	2287720	Anything out of EA real quickly before we move on with the news that makes you very
2287720	2288720	excited?
2288720	2292560	I think the Dragon Age story's pretty cool and NBA Jam I'm certainly looking forward
2292560	2293560	to as well.
2293560	2299680	I think NBA Jam's gonna be a letdown because the EA NBA games haven't been that great.
2299680	2307000	And then, you know, unless they make it control more like a traditional NBA Jam game, that's
2307000	2308580	the only way I can see that being good.
2308580	2315320	But either EA, the NBA Live game's not good on the Wii.
2315320	2320360	In fact, they sold so poorly that they didn't put one out this year.
2320360	2321360	2K did.
2321360	2326280	Akuma JP in chat says, don't get your hopes too high though, Rob.
2326280	2327280	That's a good point.
2327280	2330000	I've heard Final Fantasy XIII's been getting some slack, the whole like no towns thing
2330000	2332800	and it's linear.
2332800	2337480	But yeah, well, and also I should know better than to get my hopes highs or my hopes high
2337480	2339960	very high for a game because that's what I do with Blaster Master.
2339960	2340960	Don't we just need Blitz?
2340960	2341960	NFL Blitz?
2341960	2343960	Oh, I'm talking about Final Fantasy, but whatever.
2343960	2344960	Oh yeah.
2344960	2345960	Yeah.
2345960	2346960	Well, Final Fantasy's gonna be awesome.
2346960	2350320	Well, that's what Akuma's saying, be careful, don't hype it too much because it might not
2350320	2351320	be all that.
2351320	2356160	Well, the people that have been playing the Japanese version, you know, it sounds good,
2356160	2357160	so.
2357160	2358160	Alright.
2358160	2362320	Well, moving on to some, I don't know, this is kind of a mixed bag of news.
2362320	2364440	It's good news and bad news.
2364440	2368880	Activision plans on reducing the number of Guitar Hero, Band Hero, and the Music Hero
2368880	2371440	franchises that they do in 2010.
2371440	2375440	And this is coming word of mouth from the Activision Publishing CEO, Mike Griffith,
2375440	2379600	who, of course, they had a conference call this week saying that fewer SKUs will serve
2379600	2381040	as a broader audience.
2381040	2383880	In 2009, we released 25 music SKUs.
2383880	2386880	In 2010, we plan to release less than 10.
2386880	2390360	Now, of course, the speculation is, okay, well, they're gonna do away with probably
2390360	2391360	the PS2 bundles.
2391360	2393600	They can't be selling very well.
2393600	2396520	And probably a lot of these bands, specific games and so forth.
2396520	2403760	And, you know, they do a lot of game and then game plus plastic instrument, game plus plastic
2403760	2404760	instruments.
2404760	2406000	I mean, they're gonna be cutting back on those.
2406000	2408440	I imagine a lot of these are gonna be game only, right?
2408440	2412080	They'll leave the bundling to the Costco's of the world, right?
2412080	2413080	Maybe.
2413080	2418080	Well, I think, and although you're gonna hear that there's just less music games coming
2418080	2422640	from them, which I think we all kind of view as a good thing, we knew Guitar Hero was getting
2422640	2423640	too saturated.
2423640	2428640	This whole Guitar Hero Van Halen, Guitar Hero 5 band hero all coming out within like a month
2428640	2429640	of each other.
2429640	2430640	Too much.
2430640	2431640	Too much.
2431640	2436000	Unfortunately, when you talk about making a decision like that, which we do say is a
2436000	2437000	good thing.
2437000	2440960	The bad news is they're gonna lay off people because they don't need them anymore.
2440960	2444560	And some different companies really got hit hard with layoffs this week.
2444560	2447280	I heard Neversoft really got hit hard.
2447280	2451980	Also, Underground Development who made the Guitar Hero Van Halen game and they also did
2451980	2454880	a Dave Mirra BMX series.
2454880	2457040	They just, they've been slaughtered completely.
2457040	2458040	They're out.
2458040	2463000	Also, surprisingly, kind of an end of an era for us here at Orange Lounge Radio.
2463000	2466040	You know, this show started because of Dance Dance Revolution.
2466040	2469260	We all met playing DDR at the arcade and talked about music games.
2469260	2472900	And if you've ever been to a DDR tournament, especially back in the day, it was probably
2472900	2477800	sponsored by a little company trying to sell their DDR pads and their expensive mats that
2477800	2480200	would help you do a better DDR game at home.
2480200	2482160	Red Octane, that's how they started.
2482160	2487240	And of course, as you know, Red Octane teamed up with Harmonix for the first Guitar Hero
2487240	2488240	game.
2488240	2492320	Red Octane has been shut down.
2492320	2497080	Only the staff that is directly involved with instrument development will stay at Activision,
2497080	2499520	otherwise the rest of it's gone.
2499520	2502160	So it's kind of the end of an era in ways.
2502160	2503800	So I don't know, what do you guys think?
2503800	2507760	Having been fans of music games and kind of knowing Red Octane and seeing their peeps
2507760	2509640	out at DDR tournament, what do you think?
2509640	2513320	I saw this coming from the moment of the acquisition.
2513320	2514320	Did I say it?
2514320	2516400	It's sad but true, yeah.
2516400	2517480	I could see that.
2517480	2521320	I knew they were gonna squeeze what they could out of them the moment the money got bad.
2521320	2522320	Cut.
2522320	2523320	Loki?
2523320	2524320	I'm not surprised.
2524320	2528400	They've been cutting a lot of different smaller studios and stuff, but...
2528400	2530800	Oh well.
2530800	2533200	Guess we're not gonna get In The Groove.
2533200	2536760	Actually, I gotta say, that is...
2536760	2539960	Now the In The Groove fanboys can finally shut the fuck up.
2539960	2540960	I mean, seriously.
2540960	2541960	Ugh.
2541960	2543960	It's just not gonna happen.
2543960	2545640	Go away.
2545640	2547840	Duke Nukem Forever will happen before that.
2547840	2551480	So anyhow, yes, also as mentioned, let's see, what else?
2551480	2555880	Luxa Flux was shut out as well.
2555880	2558000	Neversoft employees were hit.
2558000	2561880	Half of Radical Entertainment staff, I mean, it's just...
2561880	2565080	It was not fun times at Activision this week.
2565080	2569240	So of course, you know, although we have some harsh things to say about some of those games
2569240	2572360	in development, it's never good news to talk about people losing their jobs.
2572360	2574640	So we hope those folks are able to find employment.
2574640	2578600	Hopefully a new studio will spring up, maybe to create a new type of music game or a new
2578600	2581040	type of peripheral-based game.
2581040	2583040	I'd be all about that.
2583040	2585040	Just know In The Groove.
2585040	2586240	Maybe.
2586240	2590040	Well, how about something...
2590040	2594660	A different type of sacking altogether.
2594660	2599560	For anyone who was interested, and I'm really not one of them, but I know people who were
2599560	2606880	more interested in the Alan Wake game, they actually announced that the PC version is
2606880	2609880	not going to be happening.
2609880	2615400	The Xbox 360 version of Alan Wake will be out on May 21st, but it will not be out on
2615400	2616400	PC.
2616400	2618400	It just will not work.
2618400	2621800	Well, I don't know.
2621800	2623040	Is this surprising or no?
2623040	2627160	I mean, in a way, a lot of these games now are developed with the console in mind first
2627160	2628600	and then the PC secondary.
2628600	2630400	So if it didn't work, it didn't work.
2630400	2635280	But still, if you're still a PC gamer at heart, and I gotta say, I was watching Alan play
2635280	2640440	Bioshock this week just for a little bit on his fancy new monitor, and he's got a video
2640440	2641440	card and everything.
2641440	2644880	I was like, dang, in a lot of ways, this looks better than it does on the 360.
2644880	2648640	I mean, there's still a lot of good stuff in PC games.
2648640	2652800	Well, I have to tell you, because keep in mind, now I'm playing Star Trek Online with
2652800	2658840	an old video card, and I'm gonna be upgrading mine soon, but I've seen screen captures for
2658840	2664320	people who've played on, like, you know, the newest GeForce, and it's amazing.
2664320	2669400	So really having the right card makes all the difference with a lot of PC games.
2669400	2672120	You know, even, okay, here's an example, Rob.
2672120	2677800	Sonic R, which I have on Saturn, and I have on PC.
2677800	2681800	And I played it back in the day when I got a new Radeon on the PC.
2681800	2688800	Same game, either way, played so much better on the PC, looked cleaner, so it does make
2688800	2694600	a difference if your computer's a little bit better than spec, you know what I mean?
2694600	2699360	Part of me thinks I'll be playing Microsoft Game Room more on my PC than I will my 360,
2699360	2703320	because, well, I won't have to use the 360 controller on my PC.
2703320	2708840	I can get a decent pad for, like, 15 bucks with the working.
2708840	2715400	I hate the D-pad, though, playing a classic game on that's gonna blow, so, unless Microsoft
2715400	2716640	releases a new pad, which I doubt they will.
2716640	2720860	I still want an adapter so I can use my Saturn dual analog controller.
2720860	2723440	The best controller ever.
2723440	2725680	I am interested in Alan Wake, though, I will throw that out there.
2725680	2729680	I do want to play that when it comes out among all the other, my gosh, games to catch up
2729680	2730680	on this year.
2730680	2735040	By the way, quick follow-up to the last story we were talking about, I just decided for
2735040	2739960	YouTube, Shits and Giggles, to go to redoctane.com, and now forwards you automatically to the
2739960	2742160	guitarherostore.com.
2742160	2743960	It did for the longest time, actually.
2743960	2744960	Did it?
2744960	2748040	Not a single mention of Red Octane anywhere, except at the way, way bottom of the page
2748040	2749200	in the tiny, tiny fine print.
2749200	2750200	Yeah, it's been like that for a while.
2750200	2751200	All content's coming, right?
2751200	2752200	99, 2010.
2752200	2755700	I just, well, I just haven't had a reason to visit this site in a long time.
2755700	2757820	So I don't know, maybe this has been in the works for a while.
2757820	2762420	No mention of DDR on here anymore, but they do sell the soft dance pad and the hard dance
2762420	2765120	pad, but they don't say what for.
2765120	2770000	Course there's a lot of games that use those dance pads now, not just DDR.
2770000	2774760	Anyhow, let's travel around the globe and check out some upcoming release dates for
2774760	2777800	things on systems you will be able to get.
2777800	2785920	Yes, this week, in fact, today, you can pick up your Wii remote in blue or pink, just in
2785920	2794320	time for Valentine's Day, and so that you know what sex your Wii remote is.
2794320	2799520	On the Wii will be Data East Arcade Classics coming out this week, so you can get your
2799520	2802360	BurgerTime and your bad dudes on.
2802360	2803360	Well, that's cool.
2803360	2805040	Is that coming out on any other systems or just Wii?
2805040	2806040	Just Wii.
2806040	2807040	Huh.
2807040	2809040	Are you a bad enough dude to say the president?
2809040	2811480	I know, I was gonna say bad dudes.
2811480	2816840	And it also has the BurgerTime sequel on there.
2816840	2818880	I've played the BurgerTime sequel.
2818880	2827000	It's, well, it's a typical sequel to an arcade game where the original was more fun in your
2827000	2828880	memories than the sequel was.
2828880	2835580	Dynasty Warriors Strike Force coming out this week on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
2835580	2841440	So come US Navy Seals, Fireteam Bravo 3 finally making its way out after quite a few delays.
2841440	2848040	On PSP this week, Aliens vs. Predator coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and PC.
2848040	2853560	Uh, Jay would be happy to know that Ragnarok, formerly known as Ragnarok Online, will be
2853560	2856000	making its way out for the DS this week.
2856000	2858680	Yay, playing it in English.
2858680	2862680	Tropico 3 coming out on Xbox 360 this week.
2862680	2868240	Ace Attorney Investigations, Miles Edgeworth making its way out on the DS.
2868240	2875360	The sequel to the music-making game, Korg DS10 Plus, making its way out on the DS.
2875360	2877360	Is that why Korg is in the keyboard?
2877360	2878360	Yes it is.
2878360	2879360	Sweet.
2879360	2884400	Chicken Riot, a budget shooter game coming out on the Wii.
2884400	2891240	Um, let's see here.
2891240	2902920	Prerunning making its way out on the Wii and Deadly Premonition coming out on Xbox 360
2902920	2903920	this week.
2903920	2907400	Kind of a budget horror game.
2907400	2911880	And the PC Collection of Strong Bads, cool game for attractive people making its way
2911880	2913280	out as well.
2913280	2919480	And it looks like a re-release of the, oh no, actually this might be the original Fallout
2919480	2924920	trilogy on PC for $14.99, not bad.
2924920	2925920	That's it.
2925920	2928000	Okay, let's go over to Japan and check out what's coming out over there.
2928000	2931360	Some localized versions of games you might know from over here.
2931360	2936040	Starting off on the 360, February 18th, you're gonna get Biohazard 5, which of course over
2936040	2939560	here is Resident Evil 5, now that is the Platinum Collection, obviously the game's been out
2939560	2940560	a while over there too.
2940560	2942040	It's just getting a price drop.
2942040	2946480	Dante's Inferno makes its way, a version for Japan coming out this week on the 18th, as
2946480	2950760	well as Eat Lead, the return of Matt Hazard coming out on the 360.
2950760	2954360	Heading on over to the Playstation 3, of course you also get Biohazard 5 there, but they call
2954360	2956240	it the Alternative Edition.
2956240	2960520	I don't know if this is just simply a price reduction or if they were adding something
2960520	2961520	to it.
2961520	2963160	It might be the Gold Edition that's coming out over here in March.
2963160	2964160	I think it is.
2964160	2965160	I think it is.
2965160	2968040	So it's like the, you know, souped up a little bit.
2968040	2971280	Also of course, Eat Lead and Dante's Inferno also on the PS3.
2971280	2975280	Also on the PS3, something that had a demo here in the States this week, Heavy Rain,
2975280	2978800	the Origami Killer, comes out on the 18th in Japan.
2978800	2985240	Also in Japan, Shin Sangoku Mosu Online, Kamishu Rambu comes out.
2985240	2988160	It's Sangoku Wars, but you do online.
2988160	2992240	It's 24 players that you can team up and defeat other players.
2992240	2993440	It's kind of like an action game.
2993440	2998680	You make your own warrior, customize, look, body shape, and voices.
2998680	3001680	Isn't that Romance of the Three Kingdoms?
3001680	3002680	Yeah.
3002680	3003680	Is it?
3003680	3005440	It looks Dynasty Wars-ish.
3005440	3008320	It has the combo meter and everything.
3008320	3010320	Probably a mix of the two.
3010320	3013000	It is from Koei, so it's probably.
3013000	3018360	There's one that might be their version of Strike Force, or there's a Samurai Warriors
3018360	3019920	game coming out.
3019920	3021440	Kind of cool, though.
3021440	3025280	Is there a localized version of that?
3025280	3029600	Well, Sangoku is three kingdom, or three lands.
3029600	3032600	No, but I mean, is that particular game out here?
3032600	3038520	I don't know if that one's coming out exactly.
3038520	3040880	By the way, there is a premium version of that if you want as well.
3040880	3043560	Also, quickly, big release for PS3 in Japan this week.
3043560	3047320	Skate 2 gets a price reduction, Uncharted gets a bundle pack this week.
3047320	3049080	Next week, Demon's Souls is getting a price reduction.
3049080	3052000	That was a pretty awesome PS3 exclusive.
3052000	3055280	Nothing on the Wii this week in Japan, which is somewhat surprising.
3055280	3057520	That's because next week is a pretty big week.
3057520	3062560	They have a lot of games, including the Tales of Symphonia, getting a price reduction.
3062560	3064160	That's next week, though.
3064160	3069240	PlayStation 2, of course, the Pickens are getting a little slimmer there on PS2, but
3069240	3071120	they have a game called Last Escort.
3071120	3075240	Club Kaze is coming out in regular and limited editions.
3075240	3081800	The DS gets Yu-Gi-Oh!, 5Ds World Championship 2010, Reverse of Arcadia.
3081800	3086440	So if you're still playing Yu-Gi-Oh!, you're in for a treat this week in Japan.
3086440	3097520	Obviously on the PSP this week, Last Escort as well, and, let's see, SOCOM, Fate Unlimited
3097520	3104440	gets a price reduction, Densetsu no Yu-Shan no Densetsu Legendary Saga comes out as well.
3104440	3108360	So a lot of little games here and there on the PSP this week, so there you go.
3108360	3109360	That does it for Japanese releases.
3109360	3112440	Okay, well, in the UK, we've got a small list.
3112440	3116840	We have on the 18th, Puzzle Chronicles on DS and PSP.
3116840	3124400	19th, we have Ace Attorney Investigations, Miles Edworth, Aliens vs. Predator, Dynasty
3124400	3129840	Warrior Strike Force Special, Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney, Justice for All, and Real Fishing,
3129840	3130840	Angler's Dream.
3130840	3133840	And that's it for me.
3133840	3137560	All right, just a few more stories for you guys, and then we're going to get to the
3137560	3142360	classic video game of the week, because we just wouldn't have a show here at OLR if
3142360	3144080	we couldn't have our classic game of the week.
3144080	3146560	But a few news stories first, Loki.
3146560	3147560	Yes.
3147560	3155480	During, I guess, an acceptance speech at the Japan Media Arts Festival, Miyamoto was referring
3155480	3161440	to an unannounced Nintendo hardware, and at least one new Wii project he's working on,
3161440	3165280	which uses the Wii Motion Plus peripheral.
3165280	3169560	And of course he didn't make any formal announcements or anything like that, but apparently there
3169560	3175000	is something being worked on, and I guess we'll just have to wait to find out what exactly
3175000	3176720	that is.
3176720	3179120	But I'm not surprised that there's new hardware coming.
3179120	3180800	I would guess probably a new handheld.
3180800	3185200	I know, hasn't there just been rumblings, and it seems like we've had stories, little
3185200	3189720	hints dropped by Nintendo for quite a while now that there is some type of motion-enabled
3189720	3193120	DSi coming out, or like a DS2 or something.
3193120	3196120	That's going to be dumb.
3196120	3197120	Well.
3197120	3198120	Well, okay.
3198120	3201200	The DS isn't a bad system, it's just flooded with shovelware.
3201200	3205880	I'm not saying it's dumb that they're putting out, okay, well I am saying it's dumb that
3205880	3208840	they're putting out another system, but the reason why I'm saying that is because they
3208840	3214280	just came out with the DSi, what, like a year ago.
3214280	3215280	Come on.
3215280	3218280	Well, think about when we were transitioning into the DS.
3218280	3222640	I remember the year we were there at E3, seeing the DS, it was our first E3, the year they
3222640	3225120	showed off the DS for the very first time.
3225120	3226580	Remember what else they were showing off?
3226580	3227880	The micro advances.
3227880	3228880	At the same time.
3228880	3232080	And there were people saying, well, who the hell would want to buy a micro advance when
3232080	3233720	they just announced the DS?
3233720	3234720	But the micro-
3234720	3235720	Jamie bought one.
3235720	3237680	I didn't, I do not say that I bought one.
3237680	3238680	I did not.
3238680	3239680	Oh, I'm sorry, Jamie.
3239680	3240680	Obtained one.
3240680	3241680	A required one.
3241680	3242680	A required one.
3242680	3243680	Okay.
3243680	3244680	Here's the difference, though, between that, though.
3244680	3248040	Whereas the DSi is being treated as a new platform, I mean, they are now starting to
3248040	3255320	put out DSi exclusive games, and then, you know, they're going to probably slowly phase
3255320	3259380	out the DS stuff, I guess, I don't know why they would do that, because they have so many
3259380	3260380	right now.
3260380	3265240	But to put out yet another hardware platform that's going to be a portable system, that's
3265240	3270440	kind of like, what the hell, I mean, say you just bought a DSi, you know, and it's got
3270440	3274720	a, you know, it does have, you know, feature enhancements compared to the DS.
3274720	3278440	It's not just, look, we made it smaller, or look, we made it larger, or look, we made
3278440	3279440	it purple, you know.
3279440	3282560	A camera, and memory storage, or whatever the DS I had.
3282560	3284240	Memory storage, the download service.
3284240	3285840	I never bothered with DSi.
3285840	3287120	I barely play my DS anymore.
3287120	3288120	Well, exactly.
3288120	3291360	I didn't either, but the thing is, you know, if they're going to put out, like, a motion-enabled
3291360	3296680	platform as well, you know, that's not compatible with this, I mean, seriously, how many times
3296680	3298160	are they going to get you to buy the DS?
3298160	3301200	Well, I guess, how many times did you buy the Game Boy, so.
3301200	3305520	Well, how, hasn't every Nintendo handheld just been an evolution of the previous one
3305520	3308080	of some sort, and they've all kind of been backwards compatible?
3308080	3310800	Well, I think at this point, they're going to have to come out with something new, like,
3310800	3313800	new new, you know, new hardware platform, period, you know.
3313800	3315040	They'll still play DS carts.
3315040	3316040	It will.
3316040	3317040	That's fine.
3317040	3318040	Whatever, baby.
3318040	3319040	I'm not buying it.
3319040	3323760	I'm telling you right now, I'm not paying for another, you know, handheld.
3323760	3326440	Because they're turning into Apple, where, you know, every year there'll be something
3326440	3328240	bigger and better and newer.
3328240	3329240	Hmm?
3329240	3331760	And I'm not touching Apple stuff either.
3331760	3335800	All right, well, here's something maybe Loki could play that is for a Nintendo system,
3335800	3338360	and I think this would be pretty exciting.
3338360	3346080	It's a game being developed by Epicenter, and they have combined the games Guitar Hero
3346080	3351060	and Typing of the Dead to bring you Rock of the Dead.
3351060	3356440	So you use a rock band or Guitar Hero controller on your Wii, and you use it to basically kill
3356440	3360560	undead by playing different, you know, fret patterns, or hitting different buttons on
3360560	3363400	the guitar will allow you to kill zombies.
3363400	3367640	So I don't know if that sells you guys right there, but then they also go on to say they're
3367640	3368640	serious.
3368640	3373120	They've brought in some, like, uber nerdy star-tep power into this game.
3373120	3376440	Neil Patrick Harris will be the voice of the main character.
3376440	3378640	Felicia Day will also be doing a voice.
3378640	3379880	I mean, I can't think of, like...
3379880	3383560	So they're taking the cast of Dr. Horrible's sing-along blog.
3383560	3387720	Well, if you want to go nerdy, I mean, that's the way to do it.
3387720	3388720	Don't get me wrong.
3388720	3391920	Get Elijah Dushku and Sarah Michelle Gellar and all the other Weednights.
3391920	3394440	This would be a great idea coming from Sega.
3394440	3400600	The problem is with this is you basically have something that is knocking off House
3400600	3401600	of the Dead.
3401600	3406560	I mean, even knocking off Typing of the Dead, instead of a keyboard, it's the fret buttons.
3406560	3408240	I'm sorry, there's going to be a lawsuit.
3408240	3411640	I mean, seriously, the names are too familiar.
3411640	3415040	It feels like, you know, Zombie Rock or something like that.
3415040	3417560	The names are too similar.
3417560	3420040	The presentation's too similar.
3420040	3421520	The gameplay's too similar.
3421520	3422520	It's going to be...
3422520	3423600	They're going to have a lawsuit.
3423600	3426480	You think Sega will sue to get the name changed?
3426480	3427480	I think...
3427480	3428480	I like Zombie Rock.
3428480	3430960	I think they will sue them, because, let me put it this way.
3430960	3433480	This company is putting this out of conspiracy.
3433480	3434480	There are nobody.
3434480	3438720	I mean, they're like really small development house, so...
3438720	3439720	You know what, though?
3439720	3442880	I like it when small studios have good ideas, though, and I gotta say, when I look at the
3442880	3443880	Sega...
3443880	3444880	It's not a good idea!
3444880	3445880	They just ripped someone else off!
3445880	3446880	Oh, hey!
3446880	3449180	Typing of the Dead would be awesome if I didn't have to find a keyboard and I could just use
3449180	3450180	a guitar.
3450180	3455280	But, though, I'll be honest that I had this discussion with someone about them doing another
3455280	3457640	Typing of the Dead with a different peripheral.
3457640	3460160	Like I was thinking, you know, drumming of the dead.
3460160	3462680	And I want to reiterate, Neil Patrick Harris is awesome.
3462680	3464440	Well, great for Neil Patrick Harris.
3464440	3467360	He needs, you know, money, too, to pay the bills, but I'm sorry.
3467360	3471840	It's still a rip-off, and there's nothing...
3471840	3473760	I mean, it looks exactly like...
3473760	3478640	If this Rock of the Dead came out and they didn't say who made it, who would you think
3478640	3479640	made it?
3479640	3480640	Yeah.
3480640	3481640	Because it sounds like House of the Dead.
3481640	3482640	It looks like House of the Dead.
3482640	3484320	I would have said, yes, Sega's getting funny.
3484320	3485320	Yes, exactly.
3485320	3488080	I mean, it's a rip-off, and I'm sorry.
3488080	3491520	It's kind of a bummer Sega didn't think of it.
3491520	3495920	It is a bummer, but, you know, at the same time, they probably won't make it out, at
3495920	3496920	least not under that name.
3496920	3500520	I'll give you the honest reason I'm not interested in this game, despite the voice talent behind
3500520	3502880	it, is that I'm not buying a guitar for the Wii.
3502880	3503880	Exactly.
3503880	3505240	I just have to borrow one.
3505240	3506240	Flailing.
3506240	3507240	I would totally play it.
3507240	3508240	I would totally play it.
3508240	3511040	The Dreamcast keyboard for Typing of the Dead.
3511040	3516320	I love Typing of the Dead on Dreamcast, but I would totally play this, too, on the 360.
3516320	3518320	Flailing of the Dead.
3518320	3523000	By the way, did you know that they have the air guitar controller?
3523000	3524000	No.
3524000	3526000	I saw one at Fry's.
3526000	3527000	Satar of the Dead?
3527000	3529640	No, an air guitar controller.
3529640	3530640	I know.
3530640	3531640	This is crazy.
3531640	3533340	It's a great idea.
3533340	3538840	More power to them if they're able to launch it without a lawsuit, but, I mean, seriously.
3538840	3542660	I'm trying to think, haven't there been, like, parody games before that were obvious play
3542660	3543660	on titles?
3543660	3547480	I mean, granted, I mean, there's, you know, Dawn of the Dead and stuff like that, you
3547480	3551680	know, Day of the Dead, whatever, but, okay, House of the Dead.
3551680	3556320	A zombie shooter, okay, that had a version that wasn't with a light gun.
3556320	3560480	It was with a keyboard, and you entered in commands, and it killed the zombie.
3560480	3564200	This is basically the same thing, except it's a guitar controller.
3564200	3565200	And the movie sucked.
3565200	3566200	And I'm sorry.
3566200	3572320	You know, it's just not different enough, and it will have a lawsuit.
3572320	3574080	It's what's gonna happen.
3574080	3575720	I love this from our chat room.
3575720	3576940	Chat.orangehomesradio.com.
3576940	3581600	This can only be brought to you from our chat room, is that, you know, why not take an old
3581600	3584960	Sega, if Sega wants to cash in on this, take a Sega peripheral that hasn't been used in
3584960	3594920	a while, and bring us Samba de the Dead, Samba de la Muerta, I'm gonna maraca the zombies
3594920	3595920	to death.
3595920	3596920	I would play the hell out of that.
3596920	3599920	I would play the shit out of that game, especially if Neil Patrick Harris did a voice.
3599920	3601120	You know what, Rob?
3601120	3607240	Maybe we should have that as a side to our land party, have a maraca booty shaking contest
3607240	3608240	going on in the other room.
3608240	3610640	I think Samba de la Muerta should be a dream game.
3610640	3611640	I don't know.
3611640	3612640	I'm thinking that's...
3612640	3615520	We should have that, and, of course, Rod Caliber.
3615520	3620080	Yeah, but Rod Caliber's kind of already been done.
3620080	3622040	Samba de la Dead or whatever?
3622040	3623040	Awesome.
3623040	3629800	Anyhow, boy oh boy, okay, let's take a different direction here in the show and take a look
3629800	3634600	at gaming's past, and take a trip down memory lane to figure out what the classic game of
3634600	3635600	the week is.
3635600	3639800	Because every week, Dark Soccer likes to take a trip through the vault and find a game that
3639800	3644040	she says, hey, you ungrateful kids, you ought to be playing this game.
3644040	3646640	And, of course, she picked something from the ColecoVision this week, right?
3646640	3647640	No.
3647640	3648640	No.
3648640	3649640	Maybe next week.
3649640	3650640	I said, get off my lawn!
3650640	3652560	Alright, she said, get off my lawn, and then decided to...
3652560	3653560	Go play this!
3653560	3654760	This should be the classic game of the week.
3654760	3658600	So what is your classic game of the week, Dark Saga?
3658600	3659600	Doom.
3659600	3662800	Doom is the classic game of the week.
3662800	3666000	Because it had a level called Hurt Me Plenty, and I loved it.
3666000	3667480	Well, a difficulty level.
3667480	3674120	So, yeah, it's a first-person shooter from, uh, it's id Software, right?
3674120	3675120	Or id.
3675120	3680680	I always remembered just all the cheat codes for it, like iddqd for, what was that, all
3680680	3682680	weapons or god mode?
3682680	3689040	Yeah, iddqd was, I think, god mode, and then id level skip, and then idbfg for all the
3689040	3690040	weapons and crap.
3690040	3691040	No, I...
3691040	3693560	BFG, that was just the, uh, big fucking guy.
3693560	3694560	The big fucking guy.
3694560	3695560	KFA.
3695560	3696560	That was it.
3696560	3697560	But anyway, yeah.
3697560	3704760	Um, I played a lot of Doom, a lot of Doom when it came out on, um, my friend's 486,
3704760	3709320	and basically you're a dude and you're in hell, kinda.
3709320	3712920	Um, you're just going around and shooting things and going all the way to the levels
3712920	3714920	and killing demons and yay.
3714920	3724080	Um, there were also, um, this gave us a term that we had before the coining of, you know,
3724080	3726040	first-person shooter, I really think.
3726040	3727460	And it was Doom Clone.
3727460	3731680	How often did we use the term Doom Clone back in the day?
3731680	3733400	Oh yes.
3733400	3735720	There were tons of Doom knock-off games though, tons.
3735720	3740000	But from there we had, uh, Doom 2 Hell on Earth, and by the way, the first Doom came
3740000	3741000	out in 93.
3741000	3750440	Um, Doom 2 was 1994, um, Ultimate Doom 1985, Master Levels for Doom 2, Final Doom in 1996.
3750440	3752400	Even Doom was copying Doom.
3752400	3753400	Yeah.
3753400	3761600	Um, but, now there's also, um, Doom Resurrection that came out, um, last year in June, um,
3761600	3766840	for the iPhone, which I haven't, um, played, but it's a parallel to Doom 3.
3766840	3773320	Um, Doom 4 was stated for being in production, but there's nothing out on it yet.
3773320	3781000	Um, but yeah, it's first-person, you can get a chainsaw, you can get, you know, the BFG.
3781000	3786560	Um, you can, um, there's just all kinds of, like, weird stuff also hidden in the game
3786560	3787560	too.
3787560	3794000	Um, like in, uh, Doom 2 you have a bunny called Daisy that's, you know, impaled on a steak,
3794000	3798200	and you have to get vengeance for it and crap.
3798200	3803340	And then, um, I mean, basically it's just going through.
3803340	3808020	If you play it on the weakest level and then you try to get through, um, to, uh, the last
3808020	3811320	level, um, it doesn't let you play the last level.
3811320	3814780	I know the screen goes black because I hear a brrrr.
3814780	3823020	Um, but the, the reason why, the reason why I'm bringing up Doom is because of the, um,
3823020	3828200	the home hacks, the wads, all kinds of different versions.
3828200	3835020	Like there's a Ghostbusters one and, um, there was a Gotchamon one, Alien, Sailor Moon, I
3835020	3841100	the Dragon Ball Z one back in the day. It's all these people who would just go and, you know,
3841100	3847180	change out the sprites and everything. And also, also, also, the other thing was skipping to the
3847180	3853020	hidden Wolfenstein level. Wolfenstein was the game I would mod. Not so much Doom, but I had
3853020	3858220	the Mortal Kombat characters for Wolfenstein. That was a lot of fun. Well, I also, though,
3858220	3867260	honestly, I prefer them for Quake, but we had Doom first. And I think that Doom is really the reason
3867260	3873500	why we've got, you know, just the massive tons of first-person shooters that we have today.
3873500	3878140	I kind of want to play this on Xbox Live later. Like, I want to have an epic frag fest on Doom
3878140	3883260	later. I used to play, um, this is actually the one that this video is from is Ultimate Doom,
3883260	3890460	which I played quite a bit of it on the Nintendo 64. But really, this was the game I learned my
3890460	3895500	appreciation for PC gaming on because it was from this that I was playing Duke Nukem 3D,
3896460	3900460	you know, where you could do your own voice macros and everything. And this was the game I learned
3900460	3907180	to do deathmatching on, you know. On top of that, I can play Doom without getting motion sick.
3907180	3913580	Wow. Because it's sprite based. Well, that's right. You had the whole like, um, like sprites
3913580	3919900	don't make you sick. Sprites don't make me sick. But polygons do. Interesting. I mean, and even so,
3919900	3926540	if it's running really smoothly, I can get kind of sick. But I was playing Hexen, you know, for
3926540	3936620	a long time. So this one, though, I have a lot of fond memories of it being 1995 and going to hang
3936620	3942140	out. This was no, I take the back 94 my first year of college and going to hang out my friend
3942140	3947980	Marci's house playing Doom, playing Doom and Phantasmagoria. Do you remember that game?
3947980	3952220	Yeah, Phantasmagoria just came out on the good old games website this week. I don't think it's
3952220	3956620	in tonight's show. I don't remember if we talked about last week, but Phantasmagoria old is new
3956620	3962540	again. But, you know, it we were playing this and Loom. I was playing Loom when I was playing Doom.
3962540	3969500	I played a crapload of Doom dude. I used to call into a BBS that specialized in doing the Doom 2
3969500	3973500	networking. So you would call into this BBS and you do these settings. I don't even remember what
3973500	3977180	you had to do with so long ago. And then you'd launch Doom 2 and you could actually play and
3977180	3981340	this, this BBS like would charge like you'd get like an hour free and then like you had to pay
3981340	3985420	for more hours. So of course we'd keep re registering new accounts and like putting in
3985420	3992940	fake phone numbers and stuff. Well, I'll tell you, um, you know, uh, that same year of school we had
3992940	4003980	our Mac lab and keep in mind it was the old, you know, the big rectangle, uh, box tall Macs with
4003980	4011420	the crappy keyboards and shit. And mine had a black and white version of Doom on it, you know,
4011420	4016300	so I was playing Doom and black and white in class and getting a D in the class. This is a
4016300	4020300	great game of the week because I think especially for you younger folks out there to listen to the
4020300	4024540	show, like I know even though we, we swear a lot more than we should on this show and so kids
4024540	4028300	shouldn't listen to our show. I know there's some of you in like that 16, 17 range that listen to
4028300	4033020	this program. And if you're one of those folks, if you want to see what gaming was like when we
4033020	4040220	were 16, I mean not to be all like, I walked uphill back, but let's face it, we're getting old
4040220	4045420	cause we've been doing this show for eight years. But I still get carded. This was the game I would
4045420	4050700	play when I was 16. So if you want to see like a real game that we grew up on and loved, it was
4050700	4055020	Doom is a great example. Now you're making me feel a little because I was in college when I was
4055020	4061260	playing Doom. Doom came out when I was in 11th grade, but I was playing it more when I was out
4061260	4072140	of it. My computer that I had was a TI and I had a Coleco Adam. I would use the school's Apple 2e.
4072140	4078700	I didn't have my own computer until, you know, at least a regular use computer until like 95. And I
4078700	4085660	was on AOL 1.5 on DOS. I have to read this in chat real quick. Rob D's commenting on what I said
4085660	4090060	there. I'm almost 23, but I played all this stuff when I was younger. And then he links a screenshot
4090060	4094620	from ZZT. So I just wanted to take a moment to say hail ZZT, one of the greatest PC games of all
4094620	4103820	fricking time. We miss you. But, um, I do have to make a mention of it that Doom is actually one of
4103820	4111260	the games that led up to, uh, one of my favorite wads and it wasn't, um, it actually wasn't Doom,
4111260	4115260	but it was a Quake one. But I first played a version of it on Doom and then found a much
4115260	4123500	better one for Quake was, um, Gotcha Quake, which was a full on fully redone Gotcha Mon Quake.
4124860	4132140	But yeah, Doom, Doom was like my thing. So, um, yeah, for anyone who hasn't played it,
4132700	4136860	God, what planet have you been living on? Bochi Kawa in our chat room says, uh, Doom is seriously
4136860	4141420	one of the best games to have lasted for this long. Wow. Um, and you know, and like I was saying,
4141420	4145180	I didn't even have a crappy movie. If you are one of those like younger folks that didn't get to
4145180	4151740	experience this, you know, when you were a teen or whatever, um, seriously, like go on Xbox live
4151740	4155180	and check it out, you know, at least download the demo so you know what we're talking about. I mean,
4155180	4160460	Xbox live, it's not the same, but it's not bad. I mean, they did a decent job. All right. How is
4160460	4164140	this though that I still remembered at least what three of the codes were and I haven't played this
4164140	4171660	game in easily 12 years. I wonder if I hook a USB keyboard in the 360, can I play Doom with a
4171660	4177660	keyboard like I used to? I haven't thought about that. Maybe a chatter knows. Okay. And I have a
4177660	4183340	challenge then I have a challenge then, you know, let's go ahead and revive the Doom wad. Doom wad,
4183340	4188620	that's great. I want someone to make OLR Doom. Good luck. Those things take a lot of work. I
4188620	4193740	want to see someone. Someone made us a text-based game. That's true. We can have an OLR Doom.
4193740	4200940	I want OLR Doom. The text game was pretty awesome. OLR Doom. Do it. I don't know if I want to see my
4200940	4204940	face melting and getting shot. No, no, we don't use our faces. Well, we need to be the ones with
4204940	4210540	the gun. We need to be the ones with the gun and whoever wins gets a hat homemade by me. Yes. And
4210540	4215180	you guys know who the various enemies of OLR are. You can, you can put them in there. Like Ken
4215180	4223740	Kuragi will be in there with a bicycle helmet and crayons. Uh, some folks in chat saying, oh, Zen
4223740	4230060	Thrall Zen. There it is. No, Rob. I've tried. I was hoping for the same thing. Fail. So sadly,
4230060	4234780	you cannot do the keyboard. All right. So that's going to do it for the classic game of the week,
4234780	4240140	but that was a darn good one. Good job. Yeah. All right. So I know I'm awesome. We're going to take
4240140	4244300	a quick break here at OLR headquarters, but, uh, don't go anywhere. We'll be right back with part
4244300	4250380	B, a lot of quick news tonight in part B, as well as some news about another, uh, video game movie,
4250380	4255580	Sonic 4, more details, blur, a racing game I'm looking forward to, and a few more details on
4255580	4260140	Game Room. And are we looking at Wii's being, uh, hard to find all over again? We're going to talk
4260140	4265260	about that in part B. So don't go anywhere. We will be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4265260	4275500	And welcome back everybody to more of Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday night, February
4275500	4282940	the 14th of 2009. It's time for part B of our episode number 355. Uh, during the break there,
4282940	4287180	we were playing some classic 8-bit songs and unfortunately you don't hear our break music
4287180	4291740	on the podcast cause you know, copyright issues and all that. But, um, we were playing some 8-bit
4291740	4295740	songs for our, uh, chatters and they were kind of guessing and we had some, uh, let me, let me just
4295740	4299100	quickly name you the playlist we had. Cause you know, they're only about a minute long. The NES
4299100	4303340	songs were, weren't that long. So we did a lot of them. We did a Battle of Olympus, Dr. Mario,
4303340	4308540	Guardian Legend, Fashanadu, uh, Kid Icarus, Crystalis, Goonies 2, Balloon Fight. And then
4308540	4313580	what I thought was a really tricky one, Magic of Scheherazade, the town music. That was a
4313580	4318780	old school NES game I really liked. It was kind of like Zelda and an RPG like mixed together. It was
4318780	4322700	weird. And then of course Metroid. We had some requests in chat. Like I think some folks want
4322700	4326700	to hear Star Tropics and I saw a shout out for DuckTales too. Uh, we'll try to get those at the
4326700	4331340	end for our live listeners. Unfortunately, you guys who are listening to us in the podcast,
4331340	4336540	we for copyright reasons, can't do that. Although what I can do, I can, I can play the music and
4336540	4341180	then talk over it. So that's, this is the Magic of Scheherazade music. And then I want to play
4341180	4345980	like a little clip there. So, anyhow, there you go. Uh, anyone remember that game? Anyone?
4345980	4351420	Anyone remember playing it? All right. That's not even on virtual console. I think the developer who
4351420	4355740	made that game probably doesn't exist anymore. I can't remember who made that. Was that the Culture
4355740	4361660	Brain? I can't even remember. All right. Anyhow, um, let's get into some rapid fire news tonight.
4361660	4367020	And then now we're going to get into Twitter topics as well. Uh, Mailbag coming up in this
4367020	4373820	segment as well. Loki, start us off. Do you like free stuff? Because everybody does. I don't know.
4373820	4379980	I like free stuff. And, uh, one of the things that you can look forward to free is, um, the old
4379980	4385660	Command and Conquer games. That's right. EA is now offering Command and Conquer classics,
4385660	4393580	which are free to download. And, um, they are, um, including Tiberium Dawn, Tiberium Sun with
4393580	4401740	the Firestorm expansion pack and my personal favorite, Red Alert. And of course, um, I guess
4401740	4407100	apparently they are easy to download, but to get them running with your modern computers,
4407100	4413260	it may be a little bit tricky. So, uh, keep that in mind. But if you're looking to download those,
4413260	4420380	um, apparently, uh, Big Download is the website that, uh, will have those available.
4421660	4428460	bigdownload.com. Um, some other cool stuff. Of course, the Lego Star Wars games, um, very popular.
4428460	4432700	And you may be thinking, hey, what's gonna happen? And what are they gonna do for the third one?
4432700	4439180	Since obviously they've ran out of the, um, Star Wars movies. Well, not exactly. Because the third
4439180	4445420	Lego Star Wars game will actually follow the Clone Wars. Um, I'm assuming the movie and maybe the TV
4445420	4450220	series. It's scheduled to come out later this year, probably in the fall, just in time for
4450220	4455580	holidays and on all your favorite platforms, except for the PlayStation 2. And, uh, they're
4455580	4462140	seeing some brand new battle modes. Um, also some head-to-head combat as well. Uh, the level editor
4462140	4470140	from Indiana Jones, um, 2 will be coming back as well. And, um, just some new, uh, squad commands.
4470140	4476860	Uh, lightsaber slicing, lightsaber jumps, long-distance Jedi attacks, and grapple tie-ups,
4476860	4483980	and whatnot. So that's kind of cool. Even though I'm not really a fan of the Clone Wars series.
4483980	4492860	Oh well. Um, and then finally, um, L.A. Noire, a game that is coming from Rockstar, will be making
4492860	4499740	its way out this year in September. It is, of course, a kind of a crime drama game, um, brought
4499740	4507260	to you by the folks that put out Grand Theft Auto. And, uh, what once was a PlayStation 3 exclusive
4507260	4514860	is now, of course, coming out on both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. So, that is it.
4514860	4518620	All right. I've got a lot of news about the iPhone tonight. Like, all my stories are about the iPhone.
4518620	4521580	I don't know what's up with that, but I guess maybe because, you know what, when it comes to
4521580	4526220	handheld gaming, it's the biggest competitor with the DS and PSP. Real quick, real quick one.
4526220	4531340	All right. One thing we were talking about last week, you know, speaking of, um, Xbox 360 and
4531340	4538700	PlayStation 3 exclusives. Okay. Um, we were up in the air about, um, the Xbox 360 getting a version
4538700	4543180	of Final Fantasy XIV. I can confirm that is actually going to happen. Now, how do you know
4543180	4547420	this for sure? Because this is, this is somewhat of a bombshell to be dropping and part B of our
4547420	4553100	show, which a lot of people probably don't listen long enough to get to. Um, just listening from
4553100	4557820	Square. So, I'm sure they'll announce it soon at some point. You know, I don't even know when the
4557820	4562460	game's coming out right now. It's still scheduled around. Do you think, or do you have anything that
4562460	4567180	indicates to you that it's going to be simultaneous with PS3 or it should be the same later. It should
4567180	4572940	be the same time, but right now it's all kind of, you know, we don't even know exactly, you know,
4572940	4578300	for sure that it, you know, when it's coming out right now, it's like kind of hovering around June,
4578300	4582540	but that's up to get sleep all the time. That was a nice little bombshell to tuck there in a rapid
4582540	4588620	fire news. No, it's cool. Talking about exclusives. So, I mean, I don't know. It makes sense because
4588620	4595260	they're going to sell a hell lot of Final Fantasy 13 on 360. So I'm not surprised. All right. Well,
4595260	4600060	gee, it makes my iPhone stories look a little silly, but I'll try. Uh, well actually the Amiga
4600060	4604140	was awesome. And for those that remember the Commodore Amiga, it was, it was a very graphically
4604140	4607900	awesome system at the time. And if you want to play some of Amiga games on the iPhone,
4607900	4612700	you may soon have the chance. Uh, Manomio, who did the Commodore 64 emulator, remember how it
4612700	4616620	was like on the store, then not on the store and so forth. Uh, apparently they, he has gotten,
4616620	4621180	or the people, I don't know if it's just one guy or several, they've gotten an Amiga emulator to
4621180	4627180	work and they're going to release Amiga games as standalone apps. Um, apparently international
4627180	4632460	karate plus is one of the, uh, games slated for release. Looks a lot like Yer Kung Fu.
4632460	4638460	Um, Apogee's Rise of the Triad is going to be coming to the iPhone. You remember Rise of
4638460	4641740	the Triad? If I remember right, it was kind of like the Wolfenstein 3D, but kind of reskinned
4641740	4646460	and redone with the maps and so forth that is coming to the iPhone as well. There were some
4646460	4652460	earlier rumors, but it is coming to the app store in early 2010. There's actually a video on YouTube
4652460	4658540	if you want to look it up. And, uh, also big bombshell on the, uh, iPhone plants versus zombies
4658540	4663500	because pop, pop crack, you know, they put out a lot of addicting games. Plants versus zombies has
4663500	4667820	a date, which seems strange because Apple games don't usually get dated because it's just kind of,
4667820	4672300	you're at Apple's mercy. But for whatever reason, PopCap has said it is coming out on the handheld
4672300	4678300	February 15th. That would be tomorrow. Or if you're listening on the podcast, probably today
4678300	4684060	or yesterday. So, uh, plants versus zombies on February 15th on the iPhone. There you go,
4684060	4688940	DarkSakura. Well, there, um, I'm just going to have to do this as it's in front of me. Um,
4688940	4695340	someone at Kotaku received a package. That's a blue boxing glove holding a rose. Indicative of
4695340	4701740	a rumor. Ah, that perhaps Dudley will be in Street Fighter 4, or Super Street Fighter 4, I should
4701740	4708140	say. So that would be pretty cool. Even though I never used him and thought he sucked. Although
4708140	4715740	people are infuriating using him. Um, Mega Man 10, um, will have, um, a March release. Um,
4716540	4724700	the, uh, we will have it after, um, sorry, the WiiWare version will be March 1st. PlayStation
4724700	4733020	3 will be March 11th and Xbox 360 will be March 31st. And then, um, in that batch, um,
4733020	4738220	Rock Band is going to be getting, um, some new tracks. Um, an Otis Redding track pack, which is,
4738220	4743260	uh, Sitting on the Dock of the Bay. Um, the Fa, Fa, Fa, Fa, Fa Sad Song. I'm Sick Y'all,
4743260	4748780	I Got Dreams to Remember, and Love Man. And then some individual, um, tracks, All Time Low,
4748780	4753740	Weightless, Alpha Beat Fascination, Briar Sets of Orchestra, Stray Cat Strut. That's such a cool
4753740	4758860	song. And the Chemical Brothers, Let Forever Be. And they're also available for Lego Rock Band.
4758860	4765100	Okay. How about some Twitter topics then, if we're all done with, uh, the rapid fire stuff
4765100	4770700	tonight, let's get into some Twitter topics. Although our computer is acting up right now
4770700	4777260	and I can't even access the theme music because it's being rude. And I don't know if our feed
4777260	4785580	just went down. We did go down. Are we down? We're down. All right. Hold on guys. Uh, those of you
4785580	4789340	listening on the podcast, we need to go ahead and just, uh, bring our feed right back up.
4796060	4800220	Okay. We're back. We had a little bit of a live stream difficulty there. So we lost all of our
4800220	4804780	listeners there for a minute. I don't know why, but Winamp decided to crash on us. And it's kind
4804780	4808380	of an important program when we're trying to broadcast because we use Shoutcast to send our
4808380	4812860	feed over to the all game servers. So when we left off with the show, uh, Jamie had, uh, just
4812860	4818380	finished up her last, uh, little, uh, rapid fire stories talking about the rock band releases for
4818380	4821820	the week. I'm not sure if our live listeners got to hear that, uh, but we know it's saved
4821820	4825900	for the podcast. So we're going to move on now and move into some Twitter topics.
4829900	4835340	Of course, every week we invite your tweets at twitter.com slash O L R we got a lot tonight.
4835340	4839500	So I apologize if I don't get to your tweet, but we just have kind of a lot tonight. So
4839500	4843340	especially if you spent, sent multiple tweets, probably only going to read one. Okay. Uh,
4843340	4849180	tiger cloth three Oh five sends us a tweet that says game teaches. I don't even know if I should
4849180	4857260	say this with a child in the room. Game teaches S E X through the eyes of a superhero. Of course,
4857260	4864220	Jillian would walk into the room, right? As I'm, uh, starting to, uh, read this story here.
4864220	4869740	Awkward. All right. So I game teaches S E X through the eyes of a superhero. Apparently,
4869740	4876380	uh, health officials, uh, in, uh, Ontario, Canada, uh, talking about a new video game
4876380	4881020	launched Thursday that will help teenagers learn about sex through the eyes of a superhero. He
4881020	4886220	left the room. It's okay. Uh, this is an online game, ironically by the Middlesex London health
4886220	4890540	unit. Uh, it gets a player to choose a character and answer true or false questions about their
4890540	4899180	activity. You can either be a man named captain condoms, a Virgin named wonder badge, uh, a boy
4899180	4906220	named Willie, the kid who believes size doesn't matter or power pap, a sexually active gal. This
4906220	4911180	is worth it just for the names alone. Uh, you have to fight the game super villain, the Sperminator,
4911180	4915580	who is a muscular man wearing a red wrestling mask with of course, penis arms by correctly
4915580	4919580	answering a number of questions. If you get an answer wrong, you get shot by sperm. What
4919580	4927580	the hell kind of game is this? The tiger called link to us. This is disgusting. It's www dot get
4927580	4933500	it on london.com and uh, it's supposed to be, you know, about health clinics and using
4933500	4937900	contraceptives and all this stuff. And believe it or not, it's being promoted at some public
4937900	4942620	schools from the region. Now that whole thing came from Montreal gazette.com so it is being
4942620	4948460	used in some places. That was a fascinating little Twitter story. There you go. Um,
4948460	4955260	let's see from dark Tetsuya on Twitter. The guys that released the police knots, English patch are
4955260	4961020	working on their next project, dead of the brain, a one and two, and that was on the PC engine. So
4961020	4963900	I don't know if those are games that dark soccer is familiar with, but those are the games they're
4963900	4969340	going to translate next. Dead of the brain one and two on PC engine. Their adventure games was
4969340	4975020	zombies. Sounds like fun. Uh, SGA 100. Matt linked us to this. I don't know if any of you guys saw
4975020	4980780	that new, we are the world video for the 25th anniversary or whatever refuse. It was, it was
4980780	4986060	awful. It is awful. Like Michael Jackson, like seriously, if I were him, I would rise from the
4986060	4992060	grave and like slap, um, who's that guy, little Wayne or whatever in the face for using auto
4992060	4997340	tune in a disgusting way on that song. Um, there was auto tune on that song. It was bad.
4998140	5002780	It is. And just, it is bad. He couldn't so bad. Well, we just know he can't say it was so bad.
5002780	5007340	Like seriously, like I'm all for, you know, you supporting charities and all that, but don't do
5007340	5012060	it through this organization. Like just, just donate to the red cross or donate to one of the
5012060	5015820	Haiti relief organizations. Don't make these celebrities think they actually helped cause
5015820	5021340	they didn't. That's, that's my take on it. I'm sorry. I actually did buy the, um, the Haiti
5022300	5026300	help Haiti, whatever. Yeah. I did the little text message too. And they did a telethon and so forth.
5026300	5033820	I downloaded the album on Amazon. Oh, okay. And Shakira is not allowed to cover the pretenders
5033820	5040780	ever. Never. Anyhow, SSA 100 Matt didn't want us to just talk about that. They wanted us to
5040780	5044140	mention that somebody in the video and you can't really see who because it's obscured,
5044140	5047180	but it's circled here. Well, this is actually cause they're showing clips of, I believe this
5047180	5050860	is Haiti at this point. You actually can see somebody's wearing a fatal fury hat.
5050860	5057740	Just kind of an LOL video game reference there in the video. So it's just kind of funny. Um,
5058460	5064060	let's see, uh, going to some other tweets here. Um, act deft linked us to a tweet.
5064060	5071500	It was a retweet from rock band aid. The Viacom CEO has said rock band DLC will be more selective
5071500	5077820	in the future. Hmm. So apparently they're going to start to scale back maybe some of the stuff that,
5077820	5083420	you know, cause they put a lot of stuff on there. Um, maybe they're just finally realizing they're
5083420	5087100	not selling as much as they used to and that there's a lot of tracks that maybe just aren't
5087100	5091100	worthy of being on rock band. Maybe because they have the rock band network. Now they
5091100	5096860	can kind of screen through a lot of stuff. I don't know. Let's see. A master of the claw linked us
5096860	5101420	to a YouTube, but I can't pull it up in studio cause it'll be too quick here, but it says this
5101420	5106300	relates to typing at the dead. Apparently there was a PC guitar battling game from 1995, but it
5106300	5115500	is a short clip. Uh, and then lastly here from spazzinator PSN, which is better local or online
5115500	5123020	multiplayer? I say online for one reason, the no pants rule, LOL. So I don't know. I'm Loki. What
5123020	5128940	do you think is local or online gaming better? I would prefer local, um, gaming, you know, like,
5128940	5133740	um, some of the system link stuff I cause, you know, especially it's not dependent on having
5133740	5140060	X-Box live working cause that our work, man, we've got some serious issues with, um, you know,
5140060	5145500	lag and stuff cause we're sharing a network with, and we found out why our network is so laggy.
5145500	5151020	It's because we have these wonderful, um, or I should say it's, it was a wonderful use of company
5151020	5157580	money. Um, we have these photo frames on all of our desks that pull pictures off of a website
5157580	5164220	that have, you know, little event pictures from our work and stuff and the web shots. Yes. And
5164220	5171660	they all suck bandwidth. And so we have like X-Box life disconnects all the freaking time.
5171660	5177580	Just from those stupid things. Thankfully they're fixing it, but still, um, you know, that's why I
5177580	5181100	do like system link for that kind of stuff. And I kind of wish Grant that thought I had system
5181100	5186060	link cause if that was the case, we'd be still playing our modded games. I prefer local
5186060	5191100	multiplayer, but I really like online multiplayer when local multiplayer is impossible. Yeah. For
5191100	5194380	example, I think I've said this on the show before, my boyfriend lives two hours away.
5194380	5199180	So, you know, during the week we can't really just drive out and see each other one night. So,
5199180	5203740	you know, on the weekends we'll play like castle crashers or something together. But during the
5203740	5209900	week we play, wow, you know, online. So, uh, I don't, I like online gaming for when in real life
5209900	5216060	isn't possible. Um, there you go. That was the last question for tonight. More Twitter topics
5216060	5222140	next week at twitter.com slash O L R. Uh, let's get back into some more news stories. We'll start
5222140	5227100	off with Loki. Yes. Um, Oh, I'm sorry. Can I throw this out here real quick? I'm sorry. Act F wanted
5227100	5232700	to append his tweet saying that the rock band article goes on to talk about how the fees that
5232700	5237340	the record labels are charging for the music being on rock band is probably leading to them being
5237340	5241900	more selective, which if the record companies are going to get greedy with what ends up being
5241900	5247820	promotion for their own stuff, I say, let him get what's coming to him. And that is rock band
5247820	5255020	turning them down. Hmm. Okay. Sorry. Loki. That's all right. Um, so it's hard to believe that even
5255020	5263580	though the Wii's been out for almost three years now that, um, there's still shortages apparently.
5263580	5269260	And, um, some of the retailers are saying that the demand is still outpacing the supply
5269260	5275340	and a bunch of different retailers, including GameStop, uh, Amazon and Newegg have all been
5275340	5281900	having issues, uh, keeping the wheat in stock. And apparently, um, orders from Nintendo are just not
5281900	5288220	coming in in a timely manner. And Nintendo is saying, well, the, uh, replenishing the
5288220	5294940	Wii supply can, will be a challenge. And apparently in short term, replenishing the Wii
5294940	5300700	inventories will be a challenge, but we're doing everything we can to satisfy customers, um, or
5300700	5310380	consumers looking for a Wii to purchase. And, um, apparently, I guess, uh, December, it was thought
5310380	5316140	that Nintendo had actually reduced Wii production going into the, or, um, had actually reduced Wii
5316140	5323660	production going into the holiday is, uh, from a report in December. But you see, here's the problem
5323660	5329980	I have with this is that they always say, oh, we're having trouble, you know, making the Wii's and
5329980	5336380	stuff like that. Come on. You know, I'm not believing, I don't buy it. I'm not believing that any of those
5336380	5340860	shortages from before or even like, I think they were all manufactured. And I mean, come on, this
5340860	5346540	shortage now you can't put out a console. You know, why aren't you putting out tons and tons and tons
5346540	5350860	of consoles out there in the market? I mean, are you afraid that people are just going to find
5350860	5355420	everywhere and then now they're not going to want them? I mean, I don't understand if your console
5355420	5360460	is that good, then what's the problem of having a good supply of them? Oh, I know because you need
5360460	5365020	to create this artificial shortage so everyone scrambles for them. Something's up too. And I'm
5365020	5369180	calling them on it. It's, it's, this is stupid that it's like three years out and they're still
5369180	5374780	having these bad shortages. You know what? Then don't buy a Wii. If you can't find a Wii, maybe
5374780	5378780	you shouldn't buy one. Go out and get a 360 or a PS3. They're both much more reasonable than they
5378780	5387420	were before. Yeah. So. Anyhow. Well, something you shouldn't do though with these shortages,
5387420	5393100	you probably shouldn't pirate your games or you might get caught. So this is at least what one
5393100	5398380	Australian pirate wants you to know. Apparently he had pirated New Super Mario Brothers on the Wii
5398380	5405340	and I guess put it up for download. And let's see, his name was James Burt and he was 24 years old.
5405340	5410940	He illegally uploaded New Super Mario Brothers Wii to the internet and thanks to a current affair in
5410940	5416140	Australia, I guess, profiled him. He did this whole little interview there and they asked him,
5416140	5421740	did you admit that what you did was quite stupid? Apparently Nintendo Australia is claiming that the
5421740	5428620	upload of New Super Mario Brothers Wii was snatched 50,000 times. He got a copy from somebody
5428620	5435100	who broke the street date on the game and basically saying the folks at Nintendo, it's no different
5435100	5442380	than stealing anything else. Now let's see, James Burt will have to pay a 1.5 million dollar fine in
5442380	5448460	Australian dollars. It's about 1.3 million US. That was a settlement by the way too. Wow. He says
5448460	5451900	it's something he's going to have to work through for the rest of my life. That was a quote there.
5452540	5458140	Well that's what you get for uploading stuff to the internet. Downloading? They never seem to go
5458140	5461980	after those people but uploaders, man, those are the guys that they go after. You know what,
5461980	5465580	I wouldn't want to be the one that gets caught. So remember what they say, don't copy that floppy.
5466620	5471420	Don't worry, I'm not copying the floppies. Just, you know what, be careful.
5471420	5477820	You do, but you do admit when you copy games like that you are breaking the law. You are copying
5477820	5483100	something that's, you know, not supposed to be copied. There's really no nice way of putting it.
5483100	5487500	But you're not, I mean. Is it a Robin Hood steal for the rich, give to the poor thing? I don't know,
5487500	5492540	that's an ethical question but it is stealing. Not really, not by the definition of stealing.
5492540	5498140	Stealing means, okay, possession is moved from one object to another. If, like for example, if
5498140	5504460	you have a car stereo in your car and I somehow managed to duplicate that car stereo, you still
5504460	5511100	have your car stereo. But now I have your car stereo. I just hear all these stories about game
5511100	5515580	developers having to shut down and people losing their jobs and stuff and I don't, I don't think
5515580	5520380	piracy is as huge, especially on the consoles, maybe on PCs, but on the consoles some people
5520380	5524780	make it out to be because I think you have to kind of really know what you're doing in order
5524780	5530140	to do that. I mean, maybe I'm just being naive, that's fine, but I do feel sorry for a lot of
5530140	5536540	these folks because of piracy. I do feel bad for Nintendo and this is why that they're unable to
5536540	5541740	put out those Nintendo systems. If only they had sold 50,000 copies more of New Super Mario
5541740	5547420	Brothers Wii in Australia, the world would be a better place. Wiis would be plentiful, everyone
5547420	5551820	would be happy. I think a lot of times though, I bet of those 50,000 people, they wouldn't have
5551820	5558060	bought the game. I mean, that's the one thing I will say, maybe of the 50,000, like 500 ever
5558060	5563820	actually planned on buying the game. A lot of people want to download stuff because it's free.
5563820	5569420	There's lots of people that download CDs that are like, oh, I don't know if I had ever really
5569420	5573820	listened to this, but hey, since I have an opportunity, I'll check this out. I actually buy
5573820	5582780	CDs and individual tracks off Amazon all the time. I buy iTunes and regular CDs once in a while too,
5582780	5587660	but what I cannot stand is like import. Like very recently, I'll admit I downloaded a CD,
5587660	5591340	but that's because the CD is not out here, but it's out in another country. I'll support the
5591340	5594940	artists when they're finally released here, but in the meantime. If it's what I'm thinking of,
5594940	5600060	I'm totally planning on getting that. Yes, it is what you're thinking. And by the way,
5600060	5605340	I actually almost laid down 30 bucks to import an Angela Aki CD. So I was close.
5605340	5609260	Okay. Let me put it this way. I think people need to realize it's a worldwide market now.
5609980	5615740	I understand. I understand that, you know, it is technically theft, but it's one of those,
5615740	5619660	I guess you would say it's like a, not really a harmless crime, but it's,
5621660	5626060	you know, victimless, I guess. I don't know. But you would see, I guess you could say that
5626060	5630380	development houses are victims. And I was gonna say how many development houses did Activision
5630380	5635340	shut down? Oh, okay. Come on. That is not because of piracy. That is because they're stupid and put
5635340	5641660	out 50,000 different guitar hero games. Oh, boo fucking who? Okay. You know, those guys got paid
5641660	5645420	for making the games that they did. And you know what? The one development house put out the really
5645420	5651580	shitty, you know, Transformers games. So I don't feel bad for them at all. You know, Luxo Flux.
5651580	5655740	Hey, you made a great game when Vigilante 8 came out, but what the fuck happened since then?
5655740	5661180	Nothing. You put out crappy games now. But anyways, whatever. Okay. So that's, that's
5661180	5665500	their decision. They'll get eaten up by some other, you know, publishing house or something
5665500	5671100	like that. So they're going to be in work again eventually. But that is not because of piracy.
5671100	5676220	Piracy did not cause guitar hero Van Halen to sell like shit. The game was just shit. That's,
5676220	5681980	that's all that it comes down to. I don't think you can, maybe I'm just being naive, but I, I,
5681980	5686620	I don't pirate, pirate console games because, well, A, I just, you know, I'd rather have the
5686620	5693740	real thing. And B, it's kind of a pain in the ass to do. It's, it's, it's actually easier for
5693740	5698540	me to use something legitimate like Gamefly. I could if I wanted to, but I have too many
5698540	5705260	games I'm playing now. So why would I bother downloading and burning off a game to just sit?
5706540	5710860	Ooh, good. Look, I have a whole stack of like, you know, games I could be playing,
5710860	5715900	but I don't have time because I'm playing Borderlands or I'm playing Bioshock 2 or,
5715900	5719580	you know, it's just, I don't have time for that stuff.
5719580	5723260	All right. The views and opinions expressed by the host do not necessarily. All right. Anyway,
5723260	5727900	but if you want to express your opinion, uh, we'll take emails, mailbag at orangeontraded.com.
5727900	5733260	I'm sure some people are sitting there wanting to say their piece. So, uh, I'm sure we'll hear more
5733260	5737820	about this next week. Uh, moving on, I'm going to go ahead and cover this next story as well.
5737820	5744860	It has to do with, uh, the iPad and, uh, PopCap. Apparently PopCap, or as I've called them before
5744860	5750860	in the show, PopCrack, they do believe that the iPad will change gaming. It's just going to take
5750860	5754460	about three years and a hardware update before it's really going to happen. This comes from the
5754460	5760140	co-founder of PopCap, John Vesce, uh, talking to Eurogamer saying that the, uh, iPad will change
5760140	5764300	gaming. It will be phenomenally successful and it will fulfill a need consumers don't even know they
5764300	5768620	have yet. The iPad's important, but I think it's going to be more important in three years.
5768620	5772300	Look how long it took the iPod to get the momentum where everyone has one. It's probably going to
5772300	5777100	take the second generation iPad to make it really like, wow. This is my opinion and I think it's
5777100	5781020	going to be phenomenally successful. I really do. It's very simple. It's not like it has a magical
5781020	5785660	set of features, just a great package. I know what I'm getting when I have to get my mom a computer
5785660	5789420	now on iPad because she can't screw it up. She can't download a bunch of stuff. That's the
5789420	5792940	perfect mom computer, right? And it's the perfect computer for 10 year olds to play with. Again,
5792940	5798380	those comments from PopCap co-founder John Vesce to Eurogamer. Wrong. Okay. You know why I'm
5798380	5802460	singing wrong? I mean, it's the perfect, perfect computer. She can't download anything to it and
5802460	5807500	stuff. Okay. So what you're seeing is your mom's an idiot and can't, you know, handle, you know,
5808620	5815900	Oh, what's this attachment virus? That sounds interesting. Well, my, my mom who for the longest
5815900	5821180	time didn't even know what the CD tray did in a computer is now using email and I get emails from
5821180	5825260	her and it's very strange, but I'm just worried. My grandmother's using email. I'm worried the next
5825260	5828940	time I go, she's going to be like, Rob, I need you to help me with my computer. I want to learn how
5828940	5833820	to use Facebook. At which point I'm just going to kill myself. My mother's on Facebook. But, um,
5835020	5838460	whenever I get asked, I know I'm going to go to her house and I'm just like, her, her thing will
5838460	5842300	be riddled with popups and she'll somehow have Gator on her computer, even though they went
5842300	5847020	bankrupt like 10 years ago. Like it'll just be flooded with spyware and virus ware and all this
5847020	5853260	stuff. Well, there's, I mean, just use common sense, but I mean, okay, let's say, Oh, this is
5853260	5857500	the computer I'm going to get my mom or something like that. I'm sorry. Would you really want to get
5857500	5863020	her something that's way overpriced? You can get her a nice laptop for the same kind of money as
5863020	5867100	that. And you know what? A little bit of common sense goes a long way. Don't need the, you know,
5867100	5872220	buy them. You know, the Apple products are not, you know, computers for complete idiots. They
5872220	5876700	can't understand anything. I mean, at least that's, I hope not the impression that they're
5876700	5881980	trying to put out there. Oh, I'm sorry. You're too dumb for PC. You need to move to app to, uh,
5881980	5888060	the Apple products, you know, Apple products. It's special ed for computer users. Look,
5888060	5892380	despite the choice of words he used, I think he makes a point. It's kind of the same thing I said
5892380	5897100	about the iPad a couple of weeks ago. There's going to be a new one. Apple puts out new ones
5897100	5901580	every year. And this first version of the iPad is kind of yoink yoink, but let's not forget the
5901580	5906700	iPhone didn't have the apps on it when it first came out. And that's what really took the iPhone
5906700	5912860	to the next level. The iPad will get its features. It's just going to take a year. I tell you,
5912860	5916940	if an iPad like had a video camera on the front of it, then so you could do video conferencing
5916940	5921180	from it, like over 3g and stuff. Oh my God, it would sell like crazy. And that'll be in the
5921180	5926940	revision. It will wait and see, and then it'll change gaming. Cause it'll have a camera. It'll
5926940	5930940	have motion, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You know what though? The Nintendo we three will be
5930940	5935740	super awesome because it's going to have, you know, holographic graphics and it's just going to be
5935740	5939820	phenomenal. So let's just, you know, support them with that. Oh yeah. With a PlayStation
5939820	5944060	four is going to vacuum the floor and do the dishes and cook me breakfast.
5946540	5951420	I mean, that's stupid. That's a stupid argument. Oh, well it's not going to, it'll be good in three
5951420	5958300	years. Well, good for them. It'll be good after they figured out it sucks. That's awesome. That's
5958300	5963340	an awesome argument. Yeah, it sucks now, but you know, eventually when they figure out that it
5963340	5969340	sucks and make a better platform, then it'll be awesome. No, it won't. It'll still suck and then
5969340	5973980	they'll come out with something else. One step closer to the holodeck. Gaming always takes us
5973980	5980780	one step closer to the holodeck. Such a stupid argument. I'm sorry. Stupid pop cap. Make your,
5980780	5984540	you make your addicting little games and be done with it and we don't need your opinion out there
5984540	5989740	in the marketplace. I'm telling you, Bejeweled Blitz, seriously, crack. Seriously, crack. Okay.
5989740	5995740	And I, and I give them props for making addictive casual games that sell like crazy. At the same
5995740	6000860	time, they have no fucking clue what platform works well, you know, out there. I mean, come on,
6000860	6008700	man. It is just a large, you know, iPod touch. That's all it is. And yeah. Let the man have an
6008700	6013020	opinion. Whatever. It'll be phenomenal later on when the new version comes out. Well, that's
6013020	6016620	awesome, but you know, by that time they're going to come out with something else and people are
6016620	6020860	going to totally forget about the iPad. Where every gamer has a voice, Loki. Every gamer.
6022620	6030860	Whatever. All right, Loki, what do you have for us? Next one news. God, it's so frustrating. Um,
6030860	6034940	well, apparently they're making movies about anything nowadays. That's especially the case
6034940	6039980	when it comes to licensing movie or games into movies. Um, speaking of which, you know, half
6039980	6045820	these games that get licensed into movies, um, it's like, where the hell are they? Like for
6045820	6051340	example, clock tower, where the hell is that? I mean, shit, they're making movies based on
6051340	6055580	battleship. Wasn't there supposed to be a silent, a silent hill two movie at some point too.
6055580	6059660	Oh yeah. I'm sure after, you know, they've, you know, they're done churning out remakes.
6059660	6064060	It was supposed to be like a new clue. Like they say, keep saying as a remake of the eighties one,
6064060	6069180	but it's not because that is like, that's, that is scripture to me. You do not remake clue from
6069180	6076940	the eighties. Okay. Um, but they're gonna do like the battleship and whatever. No, in monopoly. Oh
6076940	6083100	yeah. Monopoly movie. You can't, you can't. I'd like to see a Yahtzee movie. Go fish.
6085660	6091660	A movie about old maid and it's about an old maid. It's awful. Her pairs of friends. Anyways,
6091660	6097980	speaking of awful, um, you know, one of the games that they decided to, or I guess the developer of
6097980	6102540	said game is looking to license it into a movie, kind of the opposite of where, you know, uh,
6102540	6107660	Darkest of Days. It was a game based off of, you know, you're this, these futuristic soldiers that
6107660	6112700	go back in time to save certain people from different wars. So basically it's time cop
6112700	6120780	again. Um, you go back in time and you, you know, kill people and whatnot. Um, so now they are,
6120780	6128780	they're looking at, um, I guess the, um, the writers of the rock are attached to craft the,
6128780	6132780	uh, screenplays. So, Hey, that could be kind of cool cause you know, they wrote a pretty good
6132780	6139260	screenplay for the rock, but Oh, the good thing about this though, is the premise is interesting
6139260	6145740	enough where that most people won't even realize it's a game time. And in fact, it probably,
6145740	6152060	it's a good thing that they don't associate it with the game at all. But can they make a movie
6152060	6155500	out of this? I mean, do you think it would be any good? It's vague enough to where it works. It's
6155500	6160940	people going back in time, killing other people. I mean, that sounds interesting enough. All right.
6161500	6166540	Too bad. The game didn't have more of an impact. Yeah. Uh, moving on to a game that probably will
6166540	6171020	have more impact. We talked a lot about this last week, uh, Sonic the Hedgehog four, but the news
6171020	6175020	had just recently came out when we did the show. So, um, a little more has developed, including
6175020	6179980	a rumor going around that Sonic the Hedgehog four may actually be out in retail once all of the
6179980	6184380	episodes come out on, uh, you know, the various networks, um, sort of like what they did with
6184380	6188380	grand theft auto four, you know, they had the download content and then they released a, uh,
6188380	6193260	released it to retail. Uh, this is a rumor, I guess, from people reading into the Sonic four
6193260	6198220	website. Uh, apparently, uh, even though it talks about Sonic four on digital platforms,
6198220	6203900	there's still another one that says TBD to be determined for a Sonic four. So who knows
6203900	6208380	a retail release possibly by the way, speaking of Sonic four, there's a petition going around
6208380	6213100	for folks not happy with the look of the new Sonic. That's right. Some folks say that old
6213100	6217900	2d Sonic need to come back. There is a petition because there's always some damn petition online
6217900	6223420	for something about 500 people have signed it so far wanting Sega to change the Sonic design back
6223420	6228620	to the way he looked in the Genesis era. I mean, granted, I could see like maybe a code that
6228620	6232700	unlocks the old Sonic sprite, but as far as I'm concerned, if you want to go back and see the old
6232700	6240300	Sonic from 15 years ago, go back and play the old Sonic from 15 years ago. Agree? Disagree? Dark
6240300	6245820	Sakura, what do you think of the petition? Well, it's not a sprite anyway. It's 3d model. So
6247900	6253340	whatever you can sort of take a sprite and make a 3d model out of it though. Like I would reference
6253340	6257500	like the game and watch character in smash brothers, melee. So you could sort of do it
6257500	6264380	if you really wanted to. Right. I guess it'd be possible. I mean, they could just do a
6265020	6271100	cell shaded, um, one that's like the other, I don't know, but I have no problem with it.
6272940	6277340	Going to our chat room for some always a great gems in our chat room, chat.orangetontrady.com
6277340	6280620	Legend of Zaku says, are you shitting me? There's no pleasing these diehards.
6280620	6287180	Uh, dark Tetsuya says, nah, they'll just charge for DLC to reskin them. Sad, but probably true.
6287180	6291980	Uh, let's see. Blades of Steel says, yeah, um, internet petitions don't work. And, uh,
6291980	6296220	Ray Iannami, I love this comment says, Sonic, I'm a really happy for you and I'm gonna let
6296220	6299420	you finish, but Twilight has one of the dumbest fan bases of all time.
6299420	6308140	Take from that what you will. Huh? Yeah. Hey, let's go to the mailbag.
6312300	6316700	Every week we invite you guys to send us emails at mailbag at orangelauntrady.com. And, uh,
6316700	6321340	we read a few of your favorites here on the show. Since Dark Sakura's having voice issues tonight,
6321340	6325660	I'm going to go ahead and relieve her of her mailbag duties and I'll read the mailbag for her.
6325660	6328940	So again, send us your emails at mailbag at orangelauntrady.com. We just have a
6328940	6332700	couple of emails this week. Uh, not a whole lot to read tonight, but I do want to read
6332700	6337580	these couple quick emails that we have in the mailbag. Uh, we're going to start it off with
6337580	6346460	an email from, I don't see a signature, so I'll just say, um, Sam S from the email header.
6346460	6350940	Sam says, Hey guys, sorry about the shitty grammar. I'm on my PSP, fat. I just wanted to say,
6350940	6355420	I love the show. Keep up the good work, but please get the shows on the feed as fast as possible. I
6355420	6362780	get withdrawal from you guys. So keep it up G. All right, G. Well, I'm gonna tell you that we do try
6362780	6368140	to get the shows up like the day after we record now so far for 2010, even though we missed like
6368140	6372780	two weeks of show, just because there wasn't an actual show. Uh, I'm pretty good about getting
6372780	6380460	them up in 24 hours. So I'd like to pat myself on the back. Here's a much longer email tonight from
6380460	6387260	the name Molten Brown. One of my favorite, uh, nicknames that we have out there. Hey guys,
6387260	6391100	it's Molten Brown again. Yes, despite the humor over the name last time I wrote in,
6391100	6394700	I decided to keep it. Well, good for you. You stick by what you believe in Molten Brown.
6395340	6399420	I listened to your podcast from last week when you touched on the issue of developers rights again,
6399420	6404060	and I wanted to weigh in. It's my first year of law school and other than making me more cynical
6404060	6408540	about the legal system as a whole, I am realizing how many different things affect the outcome of a
6408540	6413580	lawsuit disclaimer. I could be completely wrong and I accept that, but this is my opinion based
6413580	6418380	on what I know. Fine by me. I'm welcoming of all opinions. And honestly, I don't think the
6418380	6422060	developers would have a chance against the companies unless they banded together. And even
6422060	6426300	then it would be questionable. I know the dark Sakura feels that if you don't do anything about
6426300	6430620	a bad situation, you are helping to create the situation. And I agree with her in part,
6430620	6434220	but I also realized that the game companies are going to have a lot more money to defend
6434220	6438780	themselves than the developers. And this affects how good of lawyers they can get, what the lawyers
6438780	6443420	can do on their case, where the lawyer can devote more time to the case or has to juggle multiple
6443420	6447340	clients at the same time, and the influence they may have on the deciding of the case.
6447340	6451660	This assumption is based on a scenario where this case is filed in a state court with an elected
6451660	6456140	judge and the company or a parent company may have contributed funds to the judge's campaign.
6456140	6460060	And then there are the costs that come from having to file the case in court,
6460060	6464940	going through discovery and all the other steps of process. Developers may not have the monetary
6464940	6469260	means to defend themselves with the law, so even if they wanted to, it might not be possible.
6469260	6473660	And that sucks. Sorry for being a downer, but I wanted to shed some light on some of the other
6473660	6479660	issues developers may face that prevent them from doing anything. And Molten Brown signs his email.
6479660	6483580	This email has been brought to you by Sleep Deprivation. Need a ready excuse for screwing
6483580	6489180	up? Sleep Deprivation may be the thing for you. Dark Sakura, any comments on the other
6489180	6498220	perspective there? No, I agree with it. I just still think that if it's still, I think that
6498220	6503660	people need to put the effort into, this is why I'm thinking it would be something like along the
6503660	6509100	lines of a class action lawsuit. Well, I kind of suggested this a couple of weeks ago and I
6509100	6513260	realized this is a polarizing topic and I don't want to get too political, but I just want to
6513260	6519340	throw that idea out there and see what sticks. Unions. What if there was like a union for game
6519340	6523420	developers that they kind of banded together and then maybe could afford some of these things,
6523420	6526620	you know what I mean? Like granted, then you get all these like the dues that goes with it,
6526620	6530780	but at least there'll be like a union to fight for rights. But look, I realize it's a polarizing
6530780	6534620	topic, but I just want to throw the idea out there. I mean, can you tell me what's right or
6534620	6538300	what's wrong with that idea? I think it's a good idea. It's just the whole point that it's sad that
6538300	6543660	we're dealing with, you know, that level of corruption, I think, in the system. So if you
6543660	6546780	want to continue this debate next week, that's fine. But if you're going to email us on this
6546780	6549900	topic again at mailbagatorangeloungeradio.com, I really want to hear your thoughts on the
6549900	6555180	whole union idea. Good idea, bad idea, whatever idea. That was really it for emails this week.
6555180	6560940	Mailbagatorangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us more emails. Okay. What was that?
6561980	6565900	Having a child melt down in the other room. Yeah, I can hear. It's all right. We're going to still
6565900	6570140	try to continue with the show. After the mailbag, we always like to take a minute to say,
6570140	6574540	F U to things that are making us angry. It's a little segment we call the FUs of the week.
6574540	6592940	Dark Soccer, do you have any angst for us tonight? Being sick.
6593980	6598940	Loki. Um, not really, actually. Oh, amazing.
6598940	6605980	Really? You're just in a good mood. Everything's happy. I'm in a complacent mood. Oh, good to hear
6605980	6611260	it. Um, I don't really have a lot of FUs either. I feel like I should have something. Um, I'll just
6611260	6615740	give another FU to moving and having to get everything in boxes and all that good stuff. I'm
6615740	6619820	not looking forward to moving, but at least it'll be over after this week. Oh, and an FU to my car.
6621260	6624860	There's always a new surprise with what breaks down in my car. And today it's the air conditioner.
6624860	6631420	When you turn on the fan, now you hear this, like, I think the fan itself is just like about
6631420	6636380	to spin loose and probably, uh, fly off my car in the moment. Goody goody.
6639900	6641740	Fun time. It's going to do it for the FUs of the week.
6642860	6647020	All right. Uh, let's move on with some more, uh, new stories. Just a couple more for you guys.
6647020	6651260	Then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1 8 7 7 game O L R or username on Skype,
6651260	6655420	orange lounge radio. Do you remember if you're going to use the Skype client to actually call us
6655420	6660060	call echo 1 2 3 first, if you've never been on the show before, even if you have been on the
6660060	6665180	show before, you might just want to double check that you're okay. Uh, during the 2009 fiscal
6665180	6672220	earnings report from, um, Activision CEO, Michael Griffith noted that bizarre creations, um, would
6672220	6679980	be doing a multiplayer beta for blur next month. Uh, they didn't specify, um, when it's going to be,
6679980	6687260	um, or when exactly it's going to be. Um, but that at least it'll be on, um,
6688940	6692540	the X-Box three six. Well, they didn't say that's stupid. They didn't say what platforms
6692540	6698780	the games coming in are coming out on PlayStation three and X-Box three 60, but, um, no word on
6698780	6703580	which platform actually going to do the beta for. So, well, I'm excited for blur. It was
6703580	6707980	one of my favorite things we saw at E3 last year. It's, you know, Mario cart meets burnout. I think
6707980	6712860	it was why I was calling it before. It'll be neat. I know I'm excited for it. All right. And the last
6712860	6716860	story I have for you guys tonight has to do with game room. Of course, I'm pretty excited about
6716860	6721180	game room. I love my classic games and there are some more tidbits coming out of the X 10 event
6721180	6726140	when it comes to game room. Uh, apparently five to seven games a week are supposed to be added
6726140	6729820	for download. That's what they're claiming. We'll see if it becomes a reality or not.
6729820	6733740	Uh, they want to do like a weekly release on a particular day, kind of like what they do for
6733740	6739100	rock band or the X-Box live arcade. Uh, right now they're looking at Thursday, but that could change.
6739980	6743980	Also, apparently they're going to add some incentives for you to get games the day that
6743980	6749340	they come out. So if you like buy a game, the day it comes out, it will be a special item that stays
6749340	6753980	with you in your personal game room. Um, one of the things that, uh, the game room producer,
6753980	6759020	Fred Norton was showing off was a helicopter that flew around the player's avatar. Uh, the day one
6759020	6764700	exclusives would be different for every game. It would somehow tie on tie into the game's iconography.
6764700	6769660	So like, you know, um, and I, if you really watch that game room trailer, you see like, you can see
6769660	6774780	like a little yellow dragon from adventure rendered in 3d, which I know sounds weird, but it's like
6774780	6778700	walking around the little play house. I bet it would be little things like that, that you're going
6778700	6784060	to get for day one releases. I would imagine. So have they mentioned how you're going to be able
6784060	6787660	to go to like friends game rooms and stuff like that? Cause what's the point in decorating your
6787660	6792700	own game room? If only you see it. No, they haven't. And I'm thinking it, I wouldn't, um,
6792700	6796300	I wouldn't get too excited about this. I think it's just going to be that you have your game room
6796300	6800060	and you can go look at others games room. I would think that you would at least be able to play a
6800060	6804060	demo, but you know what it is. It's going to be the way for them to solicit the quarters.
6804060	6808700	I, you probably will do a lot of your 40 Microsoft point play or your 50 cent play
6808700	6812220	visiting other people's game rooms. I think that's the whole idea behind it is go visit
6812220	6818380	your friends game rooms and try out their machines for 40 points at pop. I bet you that's what it is.
6819900	6824700	So we'll see though. There's a still a ways to go before the end of March when game room is
6824700	6831020	expected to come out and hopefully our questions will be answered by then. So that does it for the
6831020	6835260	scheduled stories we have tonight. We're going to go ahead and go to the Skypline first though,
6835260	6839260	before we get to the Skypline and I, I want to play this voicemail, uh, because this is
6839260	6842860	about something we probably haven't talked enough about on the show, but it is a big
6842860	6845660	thing going on in our website right now. So let me play this voicemail first.
6845660	6866060	Hi Rob, this is Brett Wall from Undertation Live. Our show is on hiatus, so I'm leaving the voicemail to Orange Lawrence Radio, reminding all of your listeners to participate in QSL Madness. I'm getting distracted, but we're around 64 right now. There's some fantastic
6866060	6878940	match-ups going on. All you need is a form account and a hand to click your mouse with. Uh, it's all on our form. Uh, they're at www.orangeloungeradio.com. Be sure to visit and hello to everybody out there at Orange
6878940	6883180	Lawrence Radio Land. We miss you on QSL. Anyways, talk to you later tonight.
6884540	6888060	Thank you very much, Bresl from uh, Undertation Live. I didn't know they were on hiatus. What's
6888060	6891420	going on there? Like, well, I thought I saw a tweet about it, but I don't know. Sometimes like
6891420	6894940	Travis threatens to go on hiatus, but then doesn't really go on hiatus. So I hope everything's okay
6894940	6900460	over at QSL Land. So uh, whatever. Uh, I hope you guys get better or whatever's going on. Um, but yes,
6900460	6905820	Undertation Live Madness, the um, big battle to figure out the greatest video game of all time
6905820	6910060	is going on right now on the Orange Lawrence Radio forums. Um, it's kind of some surprising things
6910060	6914700	going on there. Like, I, I kind of lost my shit and got angry when Time Crisis beat Civilization,
6914700	6920540	which I think is a travesty. But whatever, I'll leave my opinions on the forums. Um, you can vote
6920540	6923820	for whichever game you like more and then they kind of, you know, whittle their way down. It's
6923820	6928940	kind of modeled after like a March Madness, you know, NCAA kind of thing, uh, to the greatest
6928940	6934460	video game of all time, which Super Metroid won one year. I think, uh, Mario 3 won it last year.
6934460	6938300	And so we'll see who wins this year. There's a bunch of stuff going on on the forums right now.
6938300	6941980	So if you haven't checked that out, check that out on the forums at OrangeLawrenceRadio.com. There's
6941980	6949180	a whole little March Madness section there. So take a look. All right. Um, we're gonna go to
6949180	6953580	the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR. We're now open for business on the Skype line. Go ahead and give
6953580	6958220	us a call if you'd like, and we'll take some calls. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
6959180	6962780	This is dsmaster26. Hey, dsmaster. What's on your mind?
6964460	6972620	Uh, not much. Other than I participated in the finale of 1 vs. 100, which was perceived to be
6972620	6979900	a Halo fan-gasm, as you will. Really? Did that happen tonight? Was the 1 vs. 100 finale tonight?
6979900	6985820	No, it was, uh, it was two days ago. So what did they do? What made it such a
6985820	6988940	Halo fan-gasm? I missed it. I forgot that the season was coming to an end.
6989900	6997180	They had two of the creators from Halo, three and three of you, actually the creators of the whole
6997180	7006060	series on that, talking about, um, the Halo series and Halo Legends, seeing them coming out soon.
7006060	7010860	And they were giving away three copies, um, to those who got some Halo questions right,
7011740	7016060	of the Halo Legends anime. Was there any mention of, um, the whole news
7016060	7020700	about Xbox Live? Because I know this, this just happened a couple weeks ago, about original Xbox
7020700	7024860	Live shutting down for original Xbox, and how that will impact Halo 2. Did that come up at all?
7026780	7031340	I did not talk about that. Uh, I guess that doesn't really surprise
7031340	7034780	me. I just kind of wondered if that would come up at all. Did they say anything during the
7034780	7041980	finale about the next season of One vs. 100? Um, they said there is definitely going to be
7041980	7047020	season three, but they don't know exactly when it's possibly going to start. Um,
7048700	7055660	damn, it's cold in Nebraska. And the sky is blue, what else is new?
7055660	7060380	I got a little bit of a news announcement for you guys, because, uh, the broadcasting class
7060380	7066060	from the Career Center over here in Omaha, Nebraska, is coming all the way to Anaheim,
7066060	7071500	California. All right, wait, wait, I gotta take it back to One vs. 100 for a minute here.
7071500	7075500	What do you want to see in season three? Huh?
7075500	7078860	What, what do you want to see in season three of One vs. 100?
7078860	7090940	Ooh, um, probably them to try to get, oh god, probably the guys behind DJ Hero or something,
7090940	7095340	like in, like, I don't know, something like Lady Gaga or something.
7095340	7102300	So, I agree, Lady Gaga would be great. So, so more guests. I did tune, I did play the One,
7102300	7107980	One vs. 100, uh, when Jeff Probst was a guest promoting his Survivor and all that stuff, so.
7107980	7110860	Oh, and actually, um, that same night with the Halo guys,
7111580	7116700	Jimmy Fallon, um, popped in once or twice. Oh, interesting. Was he funny?
7118540	7120780	He was definitely funny. Well, that's a first.
7120780	7124860	He also plays One vs. 100. I see. Uh, one other quick question for you,
7124860	7127580	DiazMaster, then we're gonna let you go. But a couple weeks ago here on the show,
7127580	7132460	we were talking about, you know, maybe Xbox should consider some other game shows besides
7132460	7136940	just One vs. 100. Is there a game show that you think Xbox should be doing as a game show
7136940	7141100	besides just One vs. 100? Ooh. Well,
7142460	7147900	there are three game shows in my mind that would be really good for Xbox 5 in that same
7147900	7151020	spiel that One vs. 100 is going at. Mm-hmm.
7151020	7159100	Um, and, sorry, but not really. Deal or no deal, no. That's a no-go. But, uh, probably
7159100	7162140	Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, that'd be good. Oh, okay.
7162140	7164380	Because that was a video game years ago. Good idea.
7164380	7168860	But I think it probably could take up on the lot.
7168860	7174620	I also give a big fat no to Deal or No Deal because I, it's, I hate that game show. I
7174620	7178540	think it's a terrible game show. It's the worst game show, one of the, one of the worst
7178540	7183420	they've ever done because Deal or No Deal takes absolutely no skill. There is zero skill
7183420	7185900	involved. Speaking of Deal or No Deal, it's become,
7185900	7188380	um, you know those ticket redemption games, right?
7188380	7191340	Yeah, I've played it. They need a Deal or No Deal for that now.
7191340	7196300	I've played it. I hate to admit I played it. Uh, my friend, it wasn't me, but one of my
7196300	7202300	friends actually got all the way down to opening the final case and won the jackpot. I was
7202300	7205820	amazed. But then I also wasn't because I was like,
7205820	7208380	she just got lucky because there's no skill involved.
7209740	7214780	There are two game shows in my mind would probably have to be like Real Fortune, that'd
7214780	7222300	be pretty good. And, um, Hollywood Squares. Now Hollywood Squares I'd be down with. That
7222300	7224780	would be pretty funny. You could totally do the process right.
7224780	7228700	I know you could. You could, but they won't. All right. Well, uh, DS Master.
7229900	7235100	Just to let you know, you're, I don't know what year it's my phone or something, but
7235100	7240460	the audio when you're speaking on my end, like you're sounding a little bit crackly.
7240460	7244620	I don't know what's up. Um, it's demons in the phone system.
7247340	7249500	Damn. All right. Have a good night DS Master.
7250380	7253820	All right. You too and happy Valentine's Day, O.L.R. crew.
7253820	7258780	Later. I don't know what that is. I, it's always going to sound a little weird over
7258780	7264220	our little rig set up here, but do remember if you do call O.L.R., turn your volume down
7264220	7268060	a lot so that you don't get picked up. In fact, it's even best to turn it off, but just
7268060	7273180	like, or mute it or something. Just keep that in mind. Uh, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username
7273180	7277660	on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio on Skype. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
7279020	7282140	Hi, this is Spazinator. Hi Spazinator. What's on your mind?
7283820	7289660	Uh, you know, well, one, uh, one issue is, uh, kind of, uh, you know, compound issue.
7290220	7294300	Um, I didn't know if you saw my 1-3 from earlier, but I kind of want to take, uh,
7294300	7299020	Sony to ask about, uh, problems I'm having. Please do.
7300460	7309660	Yeah, uh, you know, my initial problem is, is, uh, my PlayStation 3, uh, just last weekend,
7309660	7313180	got the dreaded yellow white of death. Uh-oh.
7313180	7324780	Yeah, uh, you know, uh, I'm sure you, you know, Dr. Sakura and, uh, you know, Loki, all, you know,
7324780	7332060	know the, you know, what that is or won't even bother to, you know, explain it, but, uh, there's
7332060	7336780	so much music. Are you just mad about the yellow light or did something happen in trying to get it
7336780	7348300	fixed? Uh, using so much, uh, the yellow white of death, uh, I know that systems fail and I can
7348300	7354620	always, you know, and I plan on taking it to Sony every six. There isn't so much a problem.
7355340	7362700	Where the problem lies is that when I explained the situation to one of the Sony reps and told
7362700	7367420	them that they need to send my system in for repairs, I need to explain to them that, uh,
7368220	7373260	I have two profiles on my system. One, you want to work just for, for, for gaming ones,
7373260	7381180	for purchasing movies and games we chose. And I have a lot of video content that purchases the
7381180	7390540	store. And, uh, I was concerned about, you know, uh, being able to play the videos that I purchased,
7390540	7396460	uh, you know, once I get the system back, cause, you know, they get really wonky DRM.
7397420	7402140	And to paraphrase what, you know, if they're one rep said, you know,
7403100	7406860	there's like a 50-50 chance that you may lose all your content.
7409100	7416540	A 50-50 chance? What the hell kind of advice is that? That's weird. I interpret that as
7416540	7421500	there's a zero chance. They're giving you false hope and that's pretty disgusting. And I remember
7421500	7427100	you went through this whole mess not that long ago with some, you lost like all your DRM to video
7427100	7431740	content and you finally got it. Like I remember you called us and we said, don't, don't take no
7431740	7435500	for an answer. You keep calling back. And finally you, you, you were able to get some of it back,
7435500	7437500	but it sounds like they're running you through that gauntlet again.
7437500	7446460	Yeah, yeah, exactly. And my, my, my problem, my, uh, why you thought is to, you know,
7446460	7454220	follow with what you just said is that I pay through the notes for all this content, you know,
7454220	7462540	you know, uh, two to three bucks per TV episode. You know, yeah, I got a whole shit ton of them,
7462540	7469900	uh, and plus 10 to $15 per movie, you know, and I get like hundreds and hundreds of videos,
7469900	7476940	so needless to say, that's a lot of money. And, you know, you know, I expect that since I pay
7476940	7482540	for all this stuff, I should be able to use it. And, you know, I ran out right now. I have, uh,
7482540	7489660	a hardware failure, you know, which like I have to send my machine into it repaired, but once I
7489660	7495500	get, you know, the machine repair, I should be able to play the content that I purchased, you
7495500	7502620	know, please keep us posted with what happens after the repair and everything, because, um,
7502620	7507740	you know, or which side of the 50 50 or whatever you end up on, because if you do lose your access
7507740	7511820	to all that and they don't do anything about it, I want to help put it out there in the public
7511820	7516540	because everybody needs to think twice about buying a damn thing from Sony. If you know,
7516540	7521180	this is the way they're going to treat it as like, well, there's a 50 50 chance it might still work.
7521180	7525900	This is why people hate DRM. And if they're going to leave the door wide open like this,
7525900	7530380	people need to know to not support it. And I would really encourage you that if Sony does not do the
7530380	7536380	right thing, does not satisfy you, does not leave you a satisfied customer, stop buying stuff on the
7536380	7539580	marketplace. I know that's going to be painful. I know you use them a lot, but you're going to have
7539580	7546620	to explore alternatives. You have to, you owe it to yourself. Yeah. Uh, what, why I kept playing for
7546620	7553340	me, which I already mentioned on Twitter and Facebook is, uh, I never had to fit my system in
7553340	7560140	just yet, because I'm waiting on a check from a social security disability PE to cover the, the,
7560140	7567260	the cost of the repairs. But once I do get that check, um, I'm going to call Sony again,
7567260	7574940	uh, get the ball rolling on the repair. And when I do that, I got to speak directly to a supervisor
7574940	7580220	like I did the last time. Good idea. We're going to have to wrap up so we get to some more calls,
7580220	7586300	but please keep us posted on what happens. I'm sure we'll do. All right. You too. Take care
7586300	7591660	about it. Good luck. Let us know what happens, man. That's that is irritating. I would be so
7591660	7595580	mad if I was him right now. Um, and I love what Brad is saying here in chat. And again,
7595580	7599660	we don't know what the end result's going to be. So we'll see. But Brad says, says in chat,
7599660	7604140	shit like this is why I just torrent my video content. Dude. Look, he was just having this
7604140	7609020	whole spiel on piracy earlier. Like this is it right here. Like people pirate because of DRM.
7609020	7615260	And if you want to know legitimately why there might be a fraction of a reason to support piracy,
7615260	7620780	listen to spassinators call. Like I would only like if, if his thing comes back and none of
7620780	7625580	his content works again, I'm going to be like, dude, you should be pirating things on the PlayStation
7625580	7628300	marketplace. Cause that's the only way you're going to get around the DRM. I don't see why
7628300	7634540	it wouldn't work because it's tied to his account, not his system. We had the problem before,
7634540	7639020	but dude, can you believe a rep told him there's a 50 50 chance you're going to lose it all.
7639020	7642540	People working for all companies. It's like saying I might like you and I might not just,
7642540	7647580	I don't know. As a customer service trainer, that irritates me. Call back and talk to a different
7647580	7652540	rep. Let's get to another call. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Good morning.
7652540	7657340	This is from the West coast of Sweden. This is Judith speaking. Well, hello. Another Swedish
7657340	7662620	listener. Do you know AK ripper? No, I don't know him, but I heard him on the, a couple of the last
7662620	7667660	episode. I think he called in and I've heard him a bunch of times. So I figured I'd try and get on
7667660	7672780	and represent Sweden. Well, Hey, we're all about dude. We're like getting bigger than ABBA. All
7672780	7677820	right. No. All right. So to what do we owe this phone call tonight? What's on your mind?
7677820	7682220	I have a couple of things. First, I would like to do like a shout out to the person who
7683180	7688380	directed me to orange launch radio and got me to start listening to it. And that's Dalit,
7688380	7695660	it's D A L 33 T. I don't think he's ever called in or been on the chat, but I just want to give
7695660	7699980	him big thank you. And hopefully he hears this and gets back to me. Dalit, thank you for being
7699980	7704540	leet because we always do say at the end of the show, um, if you like orange on his radio, tell
7704540	7709340	a friend or two about the show and help us spread the word. Clearly leet has done that and gets a
7709340	7714540	gold star for his efforts. Thank you. And happy first call to the show. Yes. And happy first call
7714540	7720060	to the show. Hopefully I'll have many more. Um, and I also have a question. Uh, you had
7720060	7725500	talked about some bit, a bit about piracy before, and if it's such a big concern and there's been
7725500	7729260	a lot of talking about it in the chat, if, what, what should they do to prevent it? Should they
7729260	7735020	have more DRM, less DRM, more extreme DRM, like maybe having to take a photo of your receipt and
7735020	7739980	then send it in and have, have to call in and then have it activated online or what should,
7739980	7744780	what should companies do to prevent piracy? You know, I don't think there's an easy answer. I
7744780	7750060	think if that answer were out there, it would be probably be being done right now. It's not easy to
7750060	7755260	solve, but how should they go about trying to sort of watch up what approach, more restrictions
7755260	7764220	or more freedom or I'm not a fan of the program based DRM. I prefer activation codes though they
7764220	7772300	are easier to bypass. Um, but for an example of it being effective, um, when I was given Guild Wars
7772300	7777660	as a present and my activation code had been scratched off, I couldn't find a generator.
7777660	7784380	I couldn't do anything. I actually took a photo of my code and gave them the serial number off
7784380	7791420	of my box. They sent me a new code and that to me I think is less frustrating than having to
7791420	7796300	deal with something that's going to install on your system or having to redownload things.
7796300	7802220	I think we're only a few years away from mandatory internet activation and you see a lot of products
7802220	7806460	already going that way and I think always there's these kind of like outs. Well, what about the
7806460	7810940	military people who don't have internet connection or you know, in, in some parts of America out in
7810940	7814780	the Midwest where, you know, there's, there's more remote parts of the country. Not everybody
7814780	7819020	has a high speed and constant internet connection, but you know, in, in five more years, I don't
7819020	7821980	think that's going to be the case. I think you're going to get a lot more places in the world wired
7821980	7827020	on the internet. I think that's where things are going to go. Do I think they should go there?
7827900	7834380	Maybe not, but that's where they're going to go. Um, I always miss the old, uh, you have to look in
7834380	7839660	the manual to look at the faces or match things up. And that's how they used to do the old PC
7839660	7845100	uh, stuff back in the day. But that's a photo copy that I know, but I missed that stuff. Okay. Here's
7845100	7849580	my real answer though, is that, um, I think one way that they could do it is, is kind of one thing
7849580	7853820	they're doing is it's kind of one of those fight fire with fire is that the publishers themselves
7853820	7858140	go out on these torrent sites and put the games up for download, but they're borked versions
7858140	7863820	like the whole, uh, you remember Arkham asylum was criminal and stuff like that. Yeah. Honestly,
7863820	7869020	I know it's a weird approach and maybe it's not like my favorite thing that they should do,
7869020	7872620	but I support the developers fighting fire with fire. It's not going to work though that way.
7872620	7877820	The reason why is because the communities now that have, you know, all the release sites and
7877820	7882460	stuff like that, they recognize that there's a borked version on there and they will basically
7882460	7888060	nuke it. And so it comes off the list of releases and then they'll wait for a legitimate release
7888060	7893420	group to release the title on there. So that may work in the short run, but people will find,
7893420	7898940	or, you know, as in the case of Batman Arkham asylum, people will find a way around it within
7898940	7906380	like a day that, and that will be done for. So really the easiest way to do it. And unfortunately
7906380	7912140	it is going to be the mandatory online and you know, um, activations. It's basically going to be
7912140	7916220	a code inside like a manual or something like that, that they're going to have to, you know,
7916220	7922620	enter in to some online services, download a key or something, or it's going to be, you know,
7922620	7926060	inside the manual and you put it in the game and then people will find a way to a key generator
7926060	7930860	around it. So no matter what they do, people will find a way around it. I got one more thought,
7930860	7934220	and then I'm sure you want to say something on this too. My other thought would be, I think the
7934220	7939260	best way to probably stop piracy or, or at least curb it, I don't think you will ever stop it,
7939260	7945420	but to curb it, I think you make it cheap. You make it stupid. Like, and I would point at iTunes
7945420	7949260	as an example of that, you know, iTunes kind of showed up in the wake of Napster, you know,
7949260	7953580	Napster got shut down. Obviously iTunes kind of showed up as like a legitimate way of doing
7953580	7957660	something like Napster. And the cool thing about iTunes, and I think one reason why it's been very
7957660	7963420	successful, it's easy enough for my mother to use. It's cheap, 99 cents a song, and stupid. Click
7963420	7967580	button, purchase song. I think that's why digital distribution and things like Steam are starting
7967580	7971980	to get more and more, and I think Steam is going to pick up, pardon the pun, Steam, and you're
7971980	7978380	going to see more, you know, these blowout sales, $9.99 for a game, click button, receive game.
7978380	7983500	Well, also it doesn't, it gives you the illusion of having not really spent anything because you're
7983500	7990940	not dealing with a tangible item. You know, it's, you're not cashing out money using your card.
7990940	7996300	You're just clicking a button and there you go. Your information is already there, which it does
7996300	8002380	encourage people to spend more. I'm guilty of the same, like Amazon's one click. That gets me. I buy
8002380	8007980	books on Kindle and end up paying too much. And look at, look at the 360, as, as Bobby lovingly
8007980	8011820	refers to it, the Microsoft space bucks. That's all just an elaborate illusion that you're spending
8011820	8016300	real money. Anyhow, caller, I know you probably have something you want to say on this. What are
8016300	8021180	your thoughts on your own question? Uh, I think they need to take away the DRM and make it,
8021180	8024780	like you said, make it cheaper and make it, encourage people to buy it. Cause having,
8024780	8028940	it's like the, I had a painful experience with Bioshock when I first bought it,
8029820	8033980	because you can install it like five times and you have to do an online activation. And after
8033980	8040380	five times you have to call in and if you want to get help to get reactivated. And then I heard
8040380	8044540	from a friend who pirated it and he didn't have any troubles. It was super easy for him. And it
8044540	8050140	feels like if I buy something, I should get more than someone who pirates it, not less. I shouldn't
8050140	8055500	be punished for paying. Dude, I'm with you. And that's almost like, like our last caller,
8055500	8059980	the guy who's having problems with his video content. He's being punished for his hardware
8059980	8064220	breaking and him trying to support things and do things the legal way. You expect anybody to
8064220	8069260	support your account. And that's why I said, dude, spazzinator, if it stops working, you need to just
8069260	8074460	stop supporting Sony like that. I mean, he's a, he's, he champions for Sony a lot on this show,
8074460	8078780	but if they're not going to return the favor to him, they can go F themselves and we should
8078780	8083260	bring it to light that, you know, if you use the Sony video marketplace to buy content,
8083260	8088060	it could possibly be a ticking time bomb. Hopefully it comes out next week that this was
8088060	8096060	all just a big scare from a bonehead rep at Sony. Let's hope. Anyhow.
8096860	8101500	Well, I'm not going to take up more of your time. I'm going to wish you a happy belated Valentine's
8101500	8106220	Day and say goodbye. You're still in time here in the US. It's 8.30 and it's still Valentine's
8106220	8110780	Day here. So thank you very much for the call. It's almost 6 a.m. here. Thank you for staying
8110780	8115260	up late. It means a lot. No worries. All right. Have a good one, buddy. Same. Night.
8115260	8118940	I love first time callers. And you know what? I think that's the perfect way to end the
8118940	8121820	Skypline tonight. So I'm sorry to those guys that didn't get through tonight. Remember,
8121820	8124940	you still can't send us tweets. You can send us emails. There are tons of other ways to
8124940	8129020	interact with the show. Um, but I think let's, let's end it on a first time caller tonight.
8129020	8133260	That was, that was a good note to end on and a good topic. Very good topic. Kind of. It's,
8133260	8137740	it's interesting how those two calls related tonight, isn't it? Anyhow. A last minute stories
8137740	8143340	Loki. I know you've got to have some last minute stories over there. Nope. No, no. I just wasn't
8143340	8150620	paying attention. Jerk. No, it's, um, I'm sure we've got something, but I just have to look it up.
8153340	8156940	Well, I, at dark soccer, do you have any last minute stories for the night? I don't know.
8156940	8162460	I'm almost done with this hat. All right. Just quick programming note next week. Um,
8162460	8166460	we are still planning on having a show next week, but I just want to warn folks if things get
8166460	8170780	delayed or something weird happens, it could happen. Just, this is live really not so much
8170780	8175820	podcast. Um, I'm moving next week. Now I have movers that are supposed to be able to do it all
8175820	8182060	in the morning, but just if weird stuff happens. Yeah. The podcast could also be delayed a little
8182060	8186300	bit next week because I may not have internet at my new place right away. Uh, but if horse comes
8186300	8190300	towards, I'll just come over here to Casa to Jamie and take care of things over here. I'm
8190300	8195020	sure she won't mind. We'll make hats together and upload podcasts. It'll be fun. I'll teach you how
8195020	8199980	to crochet. I, it might be fun. Probably be more productive than a lot of the things I
8199980	8204060	stay at home and do like world of Warcraft and stuff. All right, Loki, got any last minute
8204060	8208860	stories for us? Yeah, we'll just cover a few things here. Um, Sam and Max, the devil's playground
8208860	8214940	has been revealed by the OFLC. Um, of course, you know, that leaked out when it got raided
8214940	8222060	and, uh, the episode, uh, one of that series, uh, will now be entitled the penal zone. So, uh,
8222060	8230940	that's scheduled to be coming out, um, later on, probably this year. Uh, let's see here. Um,
8232300	8239420	Holy invasion of privacy. Bad man is unfortunately, um, gonna have to change his name after a, uh,
8239420	8247980	conflict with an existing IP. In other words, Batman. Um, so now it has been changed to,
8247980	8254140	what did I do? Oh, what did I do to deserve this? My Lord. And of course, uh, the sequel will be
8254140	8261100	coming out very soon and we'll include the original as well. Um, Square Enix has trademarked
8261100	8267340	deuce X human revolution, possibly meaning that they're going to be doing a new game in that
8267340	8271260	series. And it's been a while. It's weird to hear that Squeenix is doing that, but I have to
8271260	8277900	remember they absorbed IDOS. So this is a little weird for me, but okay. Um, and then of course,
8277900	8285980	uh, those of you who bought Darksiders, um, early enough received a, um, card with a code on it and
8285980	8291820	the instructions of do not discard this card and you'll want to save this code. It has been
8291820	8296860	revealed though that that code will entitle you to a free copy of Red Faction Guerrilla for
8296860	8303660	PlayStation three or Xbox 360. And it's, um, the offer will be available until the end of,
8303660	8312300	uh, March 7th. And apparently, um, no word on exactly when you'll receive those copies. Um,
8312300	8317820	you will have to pay $5 for shipping, however, but, um, still though Red Faction Guerrilla is
8317820	8322220	a pretty awesome game and, uh, no word if they're still printing those cards and if they're
8322220	8329340	included in, um, copies of the game as of right now. And that's about it.
8329340	8335820	All right, well, that's gonna kind of start to wrap up another edition here.
8335820	8340300	Oh, I saw something else that was kind of funny real quick, but I have, no, I didn't, I didn't
8340300	8345020	see a link to it or anything, but apparently someone's developed an emulator for the NES.
8345020	8351660	Right now it doesn't have, um, any, uh, audio in it yet, but they programmed it all in the
8351660	8357340	Blu-ray, the, uh, what is it? Blu-ray Java. So it will actually be able to run on PlayStation
8357340	8362060	3s without modification using, using just a flash drive.
8363580	8365260	That's the NES emulator?
8365260	8365500	Yeah.
8365500	8366460	Is this out yet?
8366460	8371180	Um, apparently it is. I didn't see a link to where it was at though, but, um, it doesn't run,
8371180	8374460	like I said, with, um, sound yet, but it does run.
8374460	8377980	Yeah, it's only a matter of time then before they get the sound and everything.
8377980	8381420	But that's pretty awesome though that they're able to program that and no modification.
8381980	8385420	Hopefully it plays smoothly because the PlayStation controller is a sweet controller.
8385420	8387340	I would love to play NES games with that.
8387340	8387980	Yeah.
8387980	8390300	Ones that I own the cartridge for legitimately, of course.
8390300	8391900	Of course. That's it.
8392540	8396940	All right. Well, that's going to do it for another edition here of Orange Lounge Radio,
8396940	8400460	but, uh, before we wrap things up, we've got to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
8400460	8402780	So, uh, DarkSakura, do you have any final thoughts for us tonight?
8403420	8404060	I have one.
8404860	8405340	What's that?
8405340	8421500	I need to play more Borderlands.
8422540	8426620	My final thought is I'm getting hungry again. Um, I had a very,
8426620	8429340	I had a very lovely breakfast made for me this morning. That was very filling,
8429340	8430780	but now, you know, that was, that was a while ago.
8430780	8433180	So now I'm getting to the point where I'm like, Ooh, tacos.
8433180	8435340	We'll see.
