13837	24695	Tonight, February 14th, 2010, the X10 event brings us a barrage of Xbox news, you'll see less Guitar Hero in 2010, and what new video game is getting a movie screenplay written for it?
31078	35402	Hello everybody out there and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35482	38805	It's the show where every gamer has a voice.
38885	39986	My name is Rob Roberts.
40387	45972	We'll be talking to you over the next few hours here live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
46012	49975	Joining me as she does every week, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura.
51377	52818	DarkSakura.
53278	55380	I hate that noise more than anything, you know that, right?
55420	56161	I love that noise.
56181	57042	You do that just to make me mad.
57442	59544	Also, just so you know, Jamie's a little sick tonight.
60505	61066	In the head.
61486	64209	Well, that's a given, that's always, that's like your thing.
64589	66171	I've had the crap.
66451	70315	Right, but you're not like coughing and sounding plaguey, you just, your voice is a little eh.
70796	71816	TechMasterLoki TechMasterLoki
99949	101871	The Difference Between Crocheting and Knitting
121972	122673	Not this, Rob.
122833	123694	You're making me a scarf.
123734	124054	I want a scarf.
124074	125495	I'm making you the gayest scarf ever.
125555	127057	I want a Rainbow Doctor Who scarf.
127077	127897	That's what I asked for.
127917	128398	It'd be fun.
128758	128998	All right.
129038	129259	Hi.
129339	129719	Who cares?
130580	136885	We're here, of course, every week, live Sunday nights, 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show, live at All Games Radio.
136925	139668	Big thanks to them for letting us steal their bandwidth every week.
139728	142330	It's www.allgames.com.
142370	147535	If you want to check out our own website and our show archives, you can head over to www.orangeloungeradio.com.
148215	151718	Tonight we're going to start off the show as we always do with a little bit of how was your gaming week.
152578	155360	DarkSakura, I know her voice is kind of bugging her.
155661	158002	I'll go to her anyway and ask how our gaming week was.
158443	159684	Or better yet, you know what?
159904	160744	I bet I could guess.
161205	163706	I'm going to do my impersonation of DarkSakura's gaming week.
163887	164207	You ready?
164767	164967	Okay.
166368	171710	Well, first off, I played Star Trek online, and I saw some Borg, and it was cool.
172110	173331	I didn't find any Borg.
173411	174231	I fought the Gorn.
174371	179933	Then I watched my husband play a first-person shooter, but it made me sick, so I decided to play Peggle.
180353	180854	Peggle!
181094	182694	No, I haven't played any Peggle.
183515	185335	I thought that was pretty good, Loki.
185355	189197	Why do you sound like Clarence from Wonder Shows Him?
189337	189697	I don't know.
193869	195250	I did play Star Trek Online.
195270	195910	Of course you did.
195930	198051	I did shoot the Gorn, not the Borg.
198091	199292	The Gorn are the lizard people.
199452	199632	Oh, okay.
200172	202633	And it was excellent.
204054	207575	And then I played Solitaire on my iPhone.
207595	208456	I did not play Peggle.
208556	211057	I found a Flash version of Bust a Move.
212137	213098	Or Puzzle Bobble.
214420	218562	And then we got out some obscure game system from the vault and hooked it up and played it.
218582	223445	No, we played Chrono Trigger on the Super Nintendo.
224006	225587	And Dan was playing Ninja Gaiden 3.
227688	230249	Because we have the Ninja Gaiden trilogy on the SNES.
231190	231490	I'm sorry.
231650	233091	How dare I say an obscure game?
234512	234772	Rob.
235292	235512	What?
237453	238034	Love you, mean it.
240055	241776	You did bring me coffee, so I forgive you.
242076	243597	Do you want to try and do my gaming week?
244346	245307	Do you want to try and do my Gaming Week?
245567	246127	Well!
247208	248269	Pretty close, pretty close.
248569	249630	Let's go to Loki next, though.
249670	250611	How was your Gaming Week, Loki?
251331	253973	I just played lots of Grand Theft Auto.
255414	256115	Actually, it was funny.
256335	261458	I didn't run into him, but my coworkers ran into somebody that was actually cheating.
262379	267800	Their console modded in a modded version of the game and they were cheating that way.
268420	274122	Granted, we could do that again, but I just don't want to have to have all these banned consoles sitting around.
275222	280103	Sorry, can I just say in chat, of course, I haven't given them a shout out yet, but we always welcome our chatters every week.
280183	283804	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to join us live on this Sunday evening.
284144	286705	If you're listening via the podcast, there's other ways you can interact with us.
286905	288025	Our Twitter feed at OLR.
288405	302059	Our Facebook at Orange Lounge Radio Or of course our mailbag Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com VidPower is live in our chat tonight and says Do Loki next Play GTA 4 then worked on Arcade Cabinet That would be the Loki impersonation No, that's about right
304522	307504	No, so we... I watched him play, this guy.
307905	309746	And, you know, it was just stupid.
309786	311328	But still winning.
311608	318273	I actually, I think I'm now in the 80s for... What was it?
318994	323438	True skill rank in single deathmatch.
323958	325139	So that's kind of cool.
325700	327501	So top 80 players of the world.
328762	330263	And then in...
331164	334187	Just the cumulative deathmatch ranks.
334448	340114	I'm about to break 200, so I'll be in the top 200 there, which is cool.
340334	344259	And I still frustrate my coworkers a lot because I win all the time.
344779	345220	That's okay.
345240	346481	You frustrate your co-hosts too.
346881	347302	That's all right.
348143	349164	That's not because I win all the time.
349918	369530	and then I played more Borderlands so that was fun and just kind of working a little bit through that and download the two expansions for that so hopefully I'll play those soon and then finally did work on my arcade cabinet I replaced the graphics card that was in there and
369970	373131	with a much faster one and much better one.
373832	378654	Because before I had an arcade VGA card because they were meant to output to an arcade cabinet.
378734	384116	Well, you can do it with other graphics cards, but you have to run a special driver to do it.
384596	385477	And so I did that.
385917	387978	Finally, it took me forever to get the work right.
388558	392120	But now I can play my Naomi games full speed.
392160	395761	I can play Street Fighter 4 full speed.
396562	396642	Um...
398382	425551	the only thing I can't play full speed right now that I really wish I could was my Taito X games like BlazBlue Continuum Shift is still kind of slow so I would need to get a slightly newer graphics card to get that one to work just right I think because the one I have right now the graphics card is only 64 bit which I should have bought a newer one but whatever so most of it works
427116	427476	All right.
427856	429017	Anything else you want to add?
429917	430377	Nope, that's it.
430697	431878	All right.
432618	433098	Let's see.
433939	437000	DarkSakura was kind of right when she was doing the impersonation of me there.
437440	440141	I did play a little bit of WoW this week, still leveling the characters.
441182	444303	You know what my payback's going to be for poking fun at DarkSakura?
444343	445624	Not making fun, poking fun.
445704	446724	I tease because I love.
447124	449525	I'm going to catch whatever she has, so I'm going to be here next week.
451946	452887	I put the fun in dysfunction.
469409	497581	MyGameWeek Not just WoW, I did play some other stuff too Although I did ding 37 I'm almost 38 Anyhow On my warrior Shut up Let's see, other games I played this week Because I did play some other stuff Okay, you remember last week on the show If you listened to last week's show I was squeeing all over the place Because Blaster Master Overdrive was coming out on the Wii Which is, you know, this sequel If you will, to the original Blaster Master On the NES
498602	501545	You know, of course, there was a version on the Genesis and Game Boy as well.
501565	503447	We're just kind of, I guess, assuming those didn't happen.
503928	505650	And this kind of came out of nowhere.
505750	507232	It was released this week on WiiWare.
507712	511777	And so, of course, Monday, I go home from work, automatically download this thing right away.
511817	512918	And I spent a little time with it.
513579	517243	And I'm sure everybody wants to know my thoughts because I was so excited and I was happy about it last week.
517303	518344	And so I played it and...
520146	523729	Well, I guess maybe I overhyped it a little bit.
523749	524990	It wasn't all that.
526031	526591	Well, here's the thing.
526631	527832	It wasn't bad.
528733	531195	It just wasn't what I thought it could have been.
531996	535598	A couple things I noticed right off the bat is that it did not support 16.9.
536819	540683	It still had the black bars on the left and right side of the screen on my widescreen TV.
541403	542704	The controls were a little weird.
542744	548349	I know the vehicle is supposed to control a little odd, but I felt like they overcompensated in the Blaster Master game.
549029	576389	um one of the things that kind of bugged me is I felt the different stages didn't have a lot of um differentness between them there wasn't a lot of uniqueness between the levels it's like one level was cave and it had brown walls and one level was outdoors but you go into a cave right away the other level was like ice cave and you're you have blue walls and and when you go into the overhead areas they're they're not that exciting they look like the dungeons from the 8-bit willow on the NES I mean it just kind of
577129	580151	Just different variations of a little maze like that.
580591	583813	And I wasn't all that floored with it.
584153	585554	But then you have to look at the other side of it.
585634	586355	I mean, the game was only $10.
587455	589016	They did Metroid it a little.
589036	590577	You have save points, you have maps.
590717	595060	I don't like the way they did save points because only certain caves have save points.
595100	598702	And sometimes you don't want to drive around for 20 minutes looking for a save point.
599082	600783	So, you know, I...
602344	603544	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
623171	628217	That had been made for another system and then finished for the Wii.
628257	638106	I seriously think what I played was made for the PS1 or PS2 and then for whatever reason it didn't happen, it came out on the Wii instead.
638807	640269	That's what the game kind of felt like to me.
640329	644393	It felt like a mediocre PS1 game just suddenly now on the Wii.
644913	645093	So...
645914	668268	But again, the value, $10, the music kicks ass, a lot of the remixes are really cool, and you know, there is that nostalgia factor My only other big bitch, and this is damn near a game ruiner for me, like this is why I can't play Blaster Master Overdrive for long periods of time The controls blow, they absolutely blow, and it's one really logical flaw that makes it blow
669875	673017	You use your Wiimote, like, tilted to the side like an NES controller.
673317	675278	And, you know, all the buttons pretty much are used.
675398	677839	You use the A button, the giant one, to switch weapons.
678219	681061	You use the 1 button to fire your weapon, which, you know, makes sense.
681461	685643	You use the 2 button to fire a super weapon, which you do once in a great while.
685943	687944	So you don't really... And you don't want to hit that inadvertently.
688424	691646	And then you use the trigger button on the back of the controller...
691926	692226	and DarkSakura.
711526	712626	Sucks.
712746	713987	You're not holding it.
714847	716228	I don't know who thought that.
716368	717808	That's the first thing that made me think.
717828	730952	Why can't they just do it the old way where you would just hold the fire button down and then it would just stay firing in that one direction and you can move around strafe and then you just basically let go of it and turn and then hold it down again to shoot a different direction.
731072	733354	Actdeft asks, does it have classic controller support in our chatroom?
733394	735695	It does not, which I thought was a glaring omission too.
735715	737557	You can only play it with the NES controller.
752948	756811	or I'm sorry NES style regular Wiimote tilted to the side.
758593	759433	The controls blow.
759694	763617	I was really irritated that I couldn't remap it and that's the first thing that made me think.
763917	768120	I think someone just brought this over from like PS2 and thank you chat rooms for reminding me.
768841	770682	They did release a Blaster Master on PSX.
770722	771043	They did.
771763	775726	So I don't know if this was like a sequel that they started to make or a PS2 version.
775786	776087	I don't know.
776927	779929	or, again, I'm hypothesizing just based on what I played.
779969	783692	It didn't feel like it was made for the Wii because I think if it was, it would have supported 16.9.
784752	787034	So the controls really kind of ruined it for me.
787154	793618	And it's too bad because at the end of the day, it still seems like there's a fun game in there somewhere.
794158	796500	And for $10, it's still not a terrible deal.
796980	799542	It's just I would urge you to go spend your money on the original game.
800194	801555	Honestly, that's what I do.
801956	803156	So that was Blaster Master Overdrive.
818328	819269	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
833485	862221	as far as Castle Crashers goes I love how they have all these little in jokes and they really souped it up and they added some things into it like you know fighting each other to see who can kiss the girl and the little power ups and the magic you know I think they did definitely take that genre of gaming to the next level so I was you know definitely Castle Crashers is a good buy if you haven't already bought it I mean it's like what the best selling Xbox 360 arcade game so I imagine most of you own it I just I'm slow in getting around to some games okay um
863832	890755	and then I didn't really play a whole lot else in depth but I watched my boyfriend play tons of games because he got a brand new monitor this week that's like a 25 inch monitor it's huge it's very similar to Dan's monitor it's gigantic and I just watched him play like Left 4 Dead 2 and Half-Life 2 like every neat looking game he owned he had to load within the scope of like two hours and it was pretty I will admit it was pretty and you know I played WoW on that thing too and it was very pretty very pretty
891756	893757	Anyhow, that's about it for our gaming weeks.
894297	895758	So we're going to move on.
895818	897719	We'll get into some news here in just a moment.
897759	899180	But first, we want to take some housekeeping.
899220	900140	It is Valentine's Day.
900200	903242	So for those that are celebrating Valentine's Day, happy Valentine's Day.
903302	904043	Hope it was a good one.
904763	908345	For those that aren't, well, take a moment to celebrate what you really love today.
908645	909305	Video games.
910406	914628	Join our chat, chat.orangeloungeradio.com and talk about the latest in gaming news this week with us.
915268	918210	And of course, our Twitter and all that other stuff as well that I mentioned earlier.
918570	918870	X10 Event
943400	949483	And, uh, if you remember, I mean, the original Dead Rising came out, I think, 07 or 08?
949884	950804	Around the same time?
951024	951805	I know it was in August.
952625	953405	Um, but that's pretty cool.
954426	956487	And then, uh, some of the stuff they were also showing off about it.
956507	969274	Uh, apparently, of course, since this, you know, being X10, they announced that they're gonna have an exclusive, uh, to Xbox Live, Dead Rising 2 K-0, uh, which is a prologue to the sequel of the game.
970554	989526	and we'll kind of work as a game add-on and not only that it's basically going to be the demo for the game so you'll get to kind of get your Dead Rising on slightly earlier than the game actually comes out well now Loki demos are usually free and I'm guessing this is not going to be free
990346	1003037	um maybe yeah okay maybe I mean maybe I'm not giving enough credit I mean if it's just gonna be a giant advertisement for the game maybe it will be free who knows but I just kind of doubt it I don't know why I'm being skeptical
1004624	1006425	History shows this kind of crap is usually not free.
1029252	1029813	He says no.
1030794	1032596	Tell them with the microphone, do you like games?
1033737	1034058	No.
1036080	1039704	Well, then I don't know if we're going to be able to talk too much on the show tonight.
1039724	1040445	Do you want mommy?
1041166	1042087	Do you like to play the guitar?
1044252	1044732	That's Rob.
1066877	1067157	All right.
1067878	1069580	It'll have achievements and all that good stuff, though, right?
1069960	1070140	Yes.
1070581	1074385	You know what would make a good... By the way, we have comments in chat room.
1074425	1083073	Chat.orangeonestradio.com Blackwolf in chat, our pal Bobby Blackwolf, who's on before us every Sunday at All Games Radio, says, Julian sounds like the ferret.
1084014	1084234	What?
1086276	1087638	We need to get him to say, excuse me.
1087658	1091622	No, he's the one to look in the garage.
1092243	1093625	Because that's where all the pinball machines are, huh?
1093645	1094526	He loves the garage.
1094646	1095647	Of course, of course he does.
1096188	1096748	He's a boy.
1096908	1098751	Sorry, we let a two-year-old derail the show, but that happens.
1098771	1099972	But he doesn't like games, though.
1100172	1100452	I know.
1101033	1103114	Dead Rising 2 Dead Rising 2 Dead Rising 2 Dead Rising 2
1130922	1134305	I took pictures of zombies or something like, you know, Dead Rising, Snap.
1151718	1152238	Dead Rising is awesome.
1176328	1177408	Yeah, I mean, I enjoyed Dead Rising 2.
1177448	1178929	It was kind of a pleasant little surprise.
1179129	1181749	So I'm kind of curious where they're going to go with the sequel.
1182129	1183410	I like the picture-taking thing, though.
1183710	1186370	That was the whole opening of the first game was like taking pictures, wasn't it?
1186470	1188211	Yeah, but see, he's not a journalist this time.
1188231	1194412	This time he's like, you know, a duct tape expert because, you know, that's... Is that an actual job?
1194492	1198973	You can like... What would you study in college to become a duct tape expert?
1200513	1201933	Fusion, I would imagine.
1204134	1204414	All right.
1204793	1205133	Xbox Live X10
1224578	1227921	The first game that's going to come out on March 3rd is called Toy Soldiers.
1229001	1233224	Scrap Metal is coming out as well, as well as Perfect Dark.
1233405	1237968	That's right, they're going to do a remake of Perfect Dark, and that's coming out on Xbox Live Arcade this March.
1238188	1241971	And also, kind of coming out of nowhere, Game Room is coming out.
1242031	1244212	It has been confirmed that that will come out in March.
1244593	1245914	So at least we have a target date for that.
1246414	1247755	I'm guessing just...
1248035	1249296	Perfect Dark Playthrough Perfect Dark Playthrough
1269557	1270097	I believe.
1270117	1271158	I saw him jumping.
1271278	1272738	It's just a remake of the N64 one.
1272758	1273999	Well, he can't jump in that.
1274059	1274819	Then I don't know.
1275179	1277600	Well, by the way, some of the price is already out for some of those as well.
1277640	1280541	Perfect Dark will set you back $10, 800 Microsoft points.
1280901	1283382	Toy Soldiers and Scrap Metal, $15 a piece.
1283462	1284843	That's 1,200 Microsoft points.
1285183	1291905	Of course, Game Room is free to download, but it will cost $3 if you want to play it on one system, either your 360 or your PC.
1291945	1293486	400 Microsoft points or $5 for both systems.
1297147	1301728	or 50 cents, 40 Microsoft points for one play.
1302168	1306869	Which I always thought it was supposed to be two plays, two quarters for two plays, but I guess they scaled it back to one.
1308029	1308549	So there you go.
1308589	1312770	Those are some of the prices of the games coming out on Xbox Live in March.
1313010	1314111	So definitely a very busy month.
1314371	1315671	Anything you guys are looking forward to?
1315691	1322412	I mean, I'm all about Game Room as much as I'm a little bit irritated that I've bought a lot of those games before.
1322972	1324873	You know what else I played this week?
1325033	1325553	The other night...
1327754	1354955	I think Alan was playing WoW or something and I was just I was there you know hanging out and I just fired up old Atari 2600 games I started playing Pitfall 2 The Lost Caverns I was playing that for a little bit and then I was playing an old old game called and I can't remember the name now Dragonfire I think it was called it was there was two modes to it one was where you were running across the drawbridge and you had to dodge the fireballs and then the second screen was you had to collect all the treasure and dodge the fireballs from the dragon I think it's called Dragonfire
1355916	1357638	I played those games for like an hour.
1358359	1358979	It's crazy.
1359500	1363884	So I'm all about Game Room and playing some of the classic games again as long as it's not stuff I've already bought.
1364865	1371472	So I won't be buying Scramble, thank you very much, or Frogger, or Tempest or anything else that's already been on Xbox Live.
1371492	1376136	I'm not buying Frogger just despite Frogger because I hate...
1377838	1382063	and the incessant whoring out of Frogger.
1382263	1384366	Konami, get a new game to whore out.
1384466	1385046	Seriously.
1385147	1388470	It's not Frogger itself, the classic game that you have a problem with.
1388550	1390873	It's the incessant whoring of the franchise and what it's become.
1390893	1393336	They have made me hate the original game of Frogger now.
1393837	1397718	Well, I remember when they first came out with that Frogger game on PS1, it was awesome.
1397838	1403060	Like, that first Frogger revival game was awesome when it first came out, but then it's like, that's all they make now.
1405021	1406821	So, I don't know.
1407822	1409362	But the original Frogger's okay.
1409422	1410423	My favorite Frogger...
1411303	1417308	My memories of Frogger were of being in 4th grade on roller skates playing at the skating rink in Dothan, Alabama
1440546	1442989	There was a roller rink in Roseville, California that I used to go to.
1443029	1443730	I think it's still there.
1443750	1444631	It's called Roller King.
1444651	1446734	I used to play Spy Hunter in the arcade there.
1446894	1453883	They had that same Frogger machine for at least 10 years.
1455224	1458068	And I would play it every summer on roller skates.
1458382	1460345	Lots of Frogger hate in our chat room.
1460365	1463329	Chat.orange.com Ray Iannami says Frogger sucks.
1463730	1465332	Spyro says Frogger is scary.
1465733	1467856	Toagak says Frogger, go get hit by a car.
1467896	1471862	To this day though, I play Frogger best on roller skates.
1472964	1473805	On an arcade machine.
1474125	1479068	I play Spy Hunter best with roller skates, which always fascinated me because it had a gas pedal on those machines.
1479089	1481850	I would like to see Frogger Shattered Soldier.
1482551	1484652	The funniest thing I ever saw.
1484852	1489656	I think this was in Chico, at a roller rink in Chico, California, where I went to school for college.
1490016	1496480	They had a DDR machine in a roller rink, and the first time I ever saw that, I was like, you know something bad's going to happen on that machine.
1496520	1501344	Some idgit's going to hop up on there and try to play in roller skates.
1501364	1501444	Yeah.
1501784	1504246	Now, HitStun is showing the other side of the spectrum here.
1504326	1505487	One other comment about Frogger.
1505507	1508729	I don't know how we got on this tangent, and then we'll go to DarkSakura with another news story.
1509069	1511251	But HitStun gives another side of the token here.
1512232	1515274	Frogger is a great first video game for kids.
1516875	1517876	That's a valid argument.
1518016	1519757	I think it's a good kid video game.
1519997	1521799	Loki, do you think he has a point?
1524541	1529104	If they want to turn him off of video games because they're going to frustrate the hell out of him.
1530727	1533970	I can look at it as an educational tool for hand-eye coordination.
1534210	1538053	It's a classic excuse we use with our parents.
1538214	1540816	Mother, I'm working on my hand-eye coordination.
1541196	1548162	But you're dealing with the concept of objects in motion.
1549583	1576928	so it honestly and I've actually I found a study on this a few years ago where they were saying talking about games like Frogger as being ones that teach about physics in motion so well but couldn't you learn hand-eye coordination from Street Fighter 4 you know let the kid get his butt kicked a little but it's the whole point of things moving in opposite directions of you know horizontal versus vertical movement you know spatial relations
1578314	1578995	Alright, fine.
1579135	1583803	Azure Edge in chat, by the way, jumped in and said Battletoads was his first game.
1584624	1585806	That's a game that gets you sick.
1585826	1586527	There's a game.
1587228	1588610	I can already tell you what mine was.
1589632	1590073	Pong.
1590093	1591094	Oh, of course.
1591114	1591996	And then Kangaroo.
1592717	1597599	I don't remember what my first first game was, but I have really early memories of playing combat.
1597779	1601781	It was probably combat when the family got an Atari 2600 and Spider-Man.
1602061	1607764	I remember going in my mom's bedroom where the Atari 2600 was hooked up so that she could limit my playtime to play Spider-Man.
1607984	1612226	We always had CryptoQuip at my friend's house because we had an Odyssey 2.
1613206	1614267	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1626149	1649704	I always wanted a ColecoVision but my mother I think I have two my mother wouldn't give me one because she says we have an Atari 2600 we don't need the other one which you know she made a point the ColecoVision I'm sorry was far superior alright especially since it had the expansion module that you could play Atari 2600 games on plus once we got the Commodore 64 that's really all I played for years and years I didn't even touch 2600 anymore it was all about the Commodore 64 that thing was awesome what was it TI-85 nice
1652026	1654509	Sorry, let's move on with more gaming news.
1654569	1655891	Fast forward to now.
1656992	1657453	Sorry.
1658334	1660036	I really shouldn't have been talking that much, too.
1660056	1660737	That's okay.
1661118	1664762	Well, Halo Reach Beta has a date.
1665003	1668727	It's May 3rd, but only if you already have ODST.
1670449	1678612	Um, at the X10 event, Microsoft made the announcement that the multiplayer beta was going to begin for the ODST owners.
1678892	1684754	So, um, that means you have to actually have the ODST disk to access the beta.
1685814	1687315	So, yay, I have it.
1687848	1690649	Well, yeah, I mean, it makes sense.
1690829	1696472	I mean, the people that are going to want to play Halo Reach right away already have Halo ODST.
1696632	1697953	I mean, it makes sense.
1698333	1706737	I imagine if you're a Halo fan, you know, it's not like they're pairing it with a game like Crackdown where you have to kind of go outside the genre to pick up this game.
1706757	1709018	Like, remember when the Halo 3 beta came with Crackdown?
1709318	1712380	You had to buy this completely different game to get access to the Halo 3 beta.
1713407	1714368	Crackdown was fun, though.
1714388	1718752	Yeah, although it turned out, I mean, thankfully, Crackdown was a pretty good game, but imagine if it hadn't been.
1719312	1720513	You know, that could have been a bad thing.
1720854	1724237	But, I mean, it makes sense that they're doing it that way.
1724277	1726539	I have to tell you what the joy of Crackdown was for me.
1727019	1729021	Jump, wave, jumping, huge.
1729201	1732944	Coming in the house and having Dan and Will play Crackdown.
1733445	1734766	Going, I like jumping!
1735447	1735787	Yeah.
1736107	1737488	and that little high-pitched voice.
1738069	1738769	I like jumping!
1739470	1740150	I like jumping!
1741571	1742131	Okay.
1742872	1743352	I know.
1743452	1744573	It gets stuck in my head.
1744893	1749277	So every time I think about Crackdown, I instantly hear Dan and Will in my head going, I like jumping!
1749537	1751558	Well, you won't have to worry about that when Perfect Dark comes out.
1753119	1754100	I like not jumping.
1754801	1756622	Loki, what do you think of the whole Halo thing?
1756642	1762326	I mean, for me, I'm like, oh darn, I would have liked a free demo that I could download and play, but I can't hate on what they're doing.
1762844	1766385	They did the same thing with Crackdown, of course.
1766585	1769666	I'm not surprised that they're doing the same thing with this.
1771066	1778688	I really don't care because I didn't play much of the Halo 3 beta and I just can't see myself playing much of the Halo Reach beta.
1781549	1784850	Halo Online for me is just not that big.
1785230	1785951	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1810493	1810894	That much.
1811134	1813878	So I can't see myself getting into these other ones.
1813898	1814539	But you never know.
1814599	1819946	If my college buddies call me up and say, Rob, you gotta get Halo Reach so we can all play again, I'd probably do it.
1820787	1821187	We'll see.
1822469	1823030	Let's move on.
1823090	1826154	Loki, you have a lot, a lot of news here coming from another presser.
1826502	1830123	Yes, EA, they had a bunch of stuff coming out.
1830163	1833664	I want to say it's from their end of the fiscal quarter stuff.
1834484	1840745	And they released their tentative release schedule for fiscal 2011.
1841345	1847787	So running from April or I guess, yeah, April to April 2011.
1847827	1847907	Yeah.
1851851	1856735	And of course, some stuff's not a big surprise, you know, sequels to big franchises.
1857455	1864180	One that's already been teased already, Dead Space 2 is slated for early 2011.
1864361	1867383	I didn't really say when, I guess Q4 of 2011, so...
1869324	1871405	Summer between January and March of 2011.
1872466	1877688	You can expect that one to be coming, of course, on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
1878048	1882330	I believe they're skipping the PC version this time around.
1883011	1895817	Some other things also have been teased before and are coming by holiday of 2010, Crisis 2, which was on the cover recently of one of the game magazines, supposed to be taking place in New York.
1896877	1899699	and Sims 3 will be making its way out to consoles.
1900199	1910003	Also NBA Jam coming this holiday and EA Sports MMA supposed to be coming out between October and December of 2010 as well.
1912558	1916280	and some other smaller stuff also being put out.
1918141	1922963	Of course, new Harry Potter, tie in with the Deathly Hallows.
1923243	1925764	Hey, those games make money.
1926104	1929265	Those Harry Potter games, they make money and they've only got a little bit left.
1929686	1932627	Actually, they'll probably still find a way to crank out those games even when the movies are done.
1932927	1938852	Oh yeah, I could see them doing some... Hell, they did Lord of the Rings games for the longest time.
1939172	1941054	They have another Lord of the Rings game coming out in the movie.
1941074	1942475	Harry Potter MMO.
1943476	1944997	You know someone wants to do it.
1945838	1946959	You know someone wants to do it.
1946999	1947720	It could be epic.
1947920	1953344	Do it a Harry Potter MMO with all the people I know that are really into the Harry Potter fandom.
1953885	1955106	Just log on to LiveJournal.
1955146	1956527	You'll find tons of people that love
1956727	1958449	That would get Nelly playing MMOs.
1958809	1964114	I'm telling you, I am kind of shocked there isn't already one talked in development.
1965175	1977426	That'll be the game somebody makes once all the others... Wouldn't it be awesome, just totally unrealistic and never going to happen, but wouldn't it be awesome the next game that Blizzard is developing is Harry Potter MMO?
1977606	1977906	Yeah.
1978747	1980508	Just like something ridiculous.
1980768	1981409	You know what?
1982049	1986512	If Blizzard were making that, even I would have to play it.
1986692	1987493	I really would.
1987993	1988854	You know what I've said.
1988914	1990375	Blizzard really doesn't make bad games.
1990955	1993076	They haven't made a bad game in about 25 years.
1994257	1995698	Blizzard doesn't really make bad games.
1997859	1998820	Some other games coming out.
1999681	2014711	Between July 1st and September 30th, the real-time world's crime-themed MMO, which this will probably get me into MMOs as well, APB, or what I like to call Saints Row Grand Theft Auto Online, which would be awesome.
2015251	2022635	and then of course the next Medal of Honor game right now slated for the summer as well.
2022795	2024456	Actually, no, I take that back.
2024596	2031000	It's sometime between now and March 2011, so anytime I guess for Medal of Honor.
2032601	2041451	And, let's see, to kind of go with the more casual crowd, they're going to be doing some new EA Sports Active games, which are due out around this holiday.
2042172	2046116	And, of course, it's not surprising, but they're going to be possibly...
2047297	2056966	I played those games myself and I had a bitch with them and my bitch was you couldn't skip exercises that the system was not recognizing you as actually doing due to the limitations of the Wii motion recognition which ticked me off.
2070459	2071100	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2091539	2100304	and you can use the board if you have it but a common misconception about EA Sports or EA Active, you do not need the balance board to play it.
2100504	2104426	It comes with a little wrist strap thing that you don't even really use.
2104446	2105487	The resistance band.
2105647	2108209	Well yeah, the resistance band, I'm sorry, not the wrist strap, the leg strap.
2109569	2114292	Like you put this thing on your leg and you put the Wiimote in it so it senses when you're running a little better.
2115493	2117334	I would rather just have real resistance bands.
2118918	2122941	The only reason I've won it because that's a better workout.
2123362	2127765	Nothing is going to replace like the gym and eating healthier.
2127805	2131529	But it will probably be a little bit better than fake hula hooping on.
2131549	2132650	Yes, exactly.
2132670	2134631	You know what though I think that a great way to lose weight is?
2135212	2135913	Stomach virus.
2137314	2137694	Tapeworm.
2138795	2139216	Tapeworms, too.
2155045	2156366	Was that it or is there more EA?
2156626	2157687	There's more, just real quick.
2158307	2162070	Of course, Dragon Age will be getting a sequel in early 2011 as well.
2162150	2166193	Now this is important because Dragon Age was pretty badass.
2166573	2170456	What's also interesting though is it will be making its way out to portables as well.
2170836	2172918	The DS and PSP or possibly cell phones.
2176262	2180304	Epic Dragon Age is very epic, so I'm not surprised at all that there's a sequel.
2180404	2181845	Sequel to a successful franchise?
2181925	2182265	No!
2182646	2186148	I'm kind of surprised it's coming out so fast, but there you go.
2187308	2189289	It's only, what, a year since the last one?
2189549	2190430	Yeah, but this is coming out in 2011.
2190470	2191431	It'll be over a year.
2191451	2192891	Oh, they didn't say beginning 2011.
2192931	2193072	Early 2011.
2193112	2193852	Well, that's 18 months, maybe.
2199896	2201237	It'll probably be the same engine.
2201558	2205822	That's really a long time in the gaming world.
2205863	2206964	I guess.
2207845	2208305	True.
2208325	2212810	They've already put out at least two of those EA Active games, if not three or four.
2212830	2214913	There's going to be even more, but still.
2214933	2219418	That's like a one-tenth of a Duke Nukem Forever.
2220410	2223111	All I'm saying is that, you know, they need to just make sure you take the time to get it right.
2223151	2223431	That's all.
2223631	2226833	Well, Mass Effect 1 and 2 probably had a similar gap between them, right?
2226933	2228454	Mass Effect 1 and 2 is probably what?
2228514	2230575	About 18 months or maybe two years, right?
2230875	2232736	Maybe somebody in chat knows better.
2232776	2235257	Mass Effect 1, I believe, was November 08.
2236577	2238898	And so, yeah, it's about the same.
2238998	2243460	There's people out there proclaiming Mass Effect 2 is the greatest video game ever made, period.
2243480	2246862	It's supposed to be better because it's, you know, the combat's a lot better.
2247322	2249824	Actually, it looks interesting, but I'm not going to buy it.
2250044	2253727	Well, it's on my to-play list, but I've got to be honest with y'all.
2254348	2262614	I have been a Final Fantasy fanboy since the very, very first one that my friend and I used the strategy guide made by Nintendo Power to get through.
2263635	2265096	I will be buying Final Fantasy XIII.
2265136	2267398	You probably won't hear me talk about anything but that until I beat it.
2268118	2268979	Oh, yeah.
2270180	2270420	Anyhow.
2272244	2276788	Of course, that didn't really happen with Final Fantasy XII, but I blame XII.
2277409	2279911	XII should not have been on the PS2, but that's for another day.
2279951	2282974	Go back and listen to old episodes if you want to know more thoughts on that.
2283774	2284535	Alright, so I don't know.
2284795	2288118	Anything out of EA real quickly before we move on with the news that makes you very excited?
2288178	2293083	I think the Dragon Age story is pretty cool, and NBA Jam I'm certainly looking forward to as well.
2293827	2300210	I think NBA Jam is going to be a letdown because the NBA games haven't been that great.
2302450	2308313	Unless they make it control more like a traditional NBA Jam game, that's the only way I can see that being good.
2308413	2314795	But either EA's NBA Live games are not good on the Wii.
2316035	2319877	In fact, they sold so poorly that they didn't put one out this year.
2321554	2341722	AkumaJP in chat says don't get your hopes too high though Rob that's a good point I've heard Final Fantasy XIII has been getting some slack the whole like no towns thing and it's linear but well and also I should know better than to get my hopes high very high for a game because that's what I do with Blaster Master we just need Blitz, NFL Blitz
2342902	2344123	I'm talking Final Fantasy, but whatever.
2344163	2344423	Oh, yeah.
2344623	2344803	Yeah.
2345003	2346264	Well, Final Fantasy is going to be awesome.
2346284	2348084	Well, that's what Akuma's saying.
2348164	2348565	Be careful.
2348605	2350866	Don't hype it too much because it might not be all that.
2352607	2354227	Well, people have been playing the Japanese version.
2354367	2355668	You know, it sounds good, so.
2357267	2362230	Alright, well moving on to some, I don't know, this is kind of a mixed bag of news.
2362290	2363291	It's good news and bad news.
2364372	2370256	Activision plans on reducing the number of Guitar Hero, Band Hero, and the Music Hero franchises that they do in 2010.
2370636	2381043	And this is coming word of mouth from the Activision Publishing CEO, Mike Griffith, who of course they had a conference call this week, saying that fewer SKUs will service a broader audience.
2381083	2381963	In 2009, we released 25 music SKUs.
2382024	2384005	In 2010, we plan to release less than 10.
2387367	2396414	Now, of course, the speculation is, okay, well, they're going to do away with probably the PS2 bundles that can't be selling very well and probably a lot of these band-specific games and so forth.
2396514	2404460	And, you know, they do a lot of game and then game plus plastic instrument, game plus plastic instruments.
2404700	2406021	I mean, they're going to be cutting back on those.
2406041	2408283	I imagine a lot of these are going to be game only, right?
2408403	2410925	They'll leave the bundling to the Costcos of the world, right?
2411646	2411826	Maybe.
2412486	2412766	Maybe.
2413807	2420992	Well, I think, and although you're going to hear that there's just less music games coming from them, which I think we all kind of view as a good thing.
2421373	2423574	We knew Guitar Hero was getting too saturated.
2423634	2429679	This whole Guitar Hero, Van Halen, Guitar Hero 5, Band Hero, all coming out within like a month of each other, too much.
2430339	2430660	Too much.
2431600	2461305	unfortunately when you talk about making a decision like that which we do say is a good thing the bad news is they're going to lay off people because they don't need them anymore and some different companies really got hit hard with layoffs this week I heard Neversoft really got hit hard also Underground Development who made the Guitar Hero Van Halen game and they also did a Dave Mira BMX series they've been slaughtered completely they're out also surprisingly kind of an end of an era
2461585	2462986	for us here at Orange Lounge Radio.
2463026	2466007	You know this show started because of Dance Dance Revolution.
2466047	2468649	We all met playing DDR at the arcade and talked about music games.
2469209	2479734	And if you've ever been to a DDR tournament, especially back in the day, it was probably sponsored by a little company trying to sell their DDR pads and their expensive mats that would help you do a better DDR game at home.
2480154	2481695	Red Octane, that's how they started.
2482135	2487318	And of course, as you know, Red Octane teamed up with Harmonix for the first Guitar Hero game.
2488298	2488939	Red Octane
2489699	2491499	has been shut down.
2492200	2498141	Only the staff that is directly involved with instrument development will stay at Activision, otherwise the rest of it's gone.
2499522	2501942	So it's kind of the end of an era in ways.
2502142	2503483	So I don't know, what do you guys think?
2503663	2509404	Having been fans of music games and kind of knowing Red Octane and seeing their peeps out at DDR Tournament, what do you think?
2509724	2511665	I saw this coming for the moment of the acquisition.
2513245	2513825	Did I say it?
2515165	2516286	It's sad but true, yeah.
2516526	2517006	I could see that.
2517620	2520923	I knew they were going to squeeze what they could out of them the moment the money got bad.
2521223	2521523	Cut.
2522704	2522964	Loki?
2523565	2524185	I'm not surprised.
2524886	2532592	They've been cutting a lot of different smaller studios and stuff, but guess we're not going to get in the groove.
2535033	2539977	Actually, I gotta say, now the in the groove fanboys can finally shut the fuck up.
2540097	2541238	I mean, seriously.
2542459	2543400	It's just not going to happen.
2543420	2544461	Just go away.
2545641	2565854	Duke Nukem Forever will happen before that so anyhow yes also as mentioned let's see what else Luxaflux was shut out never soft employees were hit half of radical entertainment staff I mean it's just it was it was not fun times at Activision this week so of course
2566294	2566855	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2584668	2585068	Maybe.
2586909	2592690	Well, how about something, a different type of sacking altogether.
2594651	2609155	For anyone who was interested, and I'm really not one of them, but I know people who were interested in the Alan Wake game, they actually announced that the PC version is not going to be happening again.
2609856	2616003	The Xbox 360 version of Alan Wake will be out on May 21st, but it will not be out on PC.
2616083	2616924	It just will not work.
2619795	2623017	Well, I don't know, is this surprising or no?
2623077	2629641	I mean, in a way, a lot of these games now are developed with the console in mind first, and then the PC secondary, so if it didn't work, it didn't work.
2630241	2644230	But still, if you're still a PC gamer at heart, and I gotta say, you know, I was watching Alan play Bioshock this week on his, just for a little bit, on his fancy new monitor, and he's got a video card and everything, I was like, dang, this, in a lot of ways, this looks better than it does on the 360.
2644550	2648553	I mean, it's, there's still a lot of good stuff in PC games.
2648713	2648913	Well,
2649153	2654714	I'll have to tell you, because keep in mind, now I'm playing Star Trek Online with an old video card.
2655134	2656474	And I'm going to be upgrading mine soon.
2656574	2663636	But I've seen screen captures for people who've played on the newest GeForce, and it's amazing.
2664256	2668697	So really having the right card makes all the difference with a lot of PC games.
2670057	2671237	Okay, here's an example, Rob.
2672277	2676098	Sonic R, which I have on Saturn, and I have on PC.
2677699	2681043	and I played it back in the day when I got a new Radeon on the PC.
2681604	2693758	Same game, either way, played so much better on the PC, looked cleaner, so it does make a difference if your computer's a little bit better than spec, you know what I mean?
2694418	2703301	Part of me thinks I'll be playing Microsoft Game Room more on my PC than I will my 360 because, well, I won't have to use the 360 controller on my PC.
2703341	2706422	I can get a decent pad for like 15 bucks.
2706782	2708262	I like the 360 controller.
2709103	2710323	I hate the D-pad, though.
2710383	2712504	Playing a classic game on that's going to blow.
2713584	2716425	So, unless Microsoft releases a new pad.
2716725	2719946	I still want an adapter so I can use my Saturn dual analog controller.
2720846	2722787	The best controller ever.
2723547	2724808	I am interested in Alan Wake, though.
2724848	2725689	I will throw that out there.
2725709	2730272	I do want to play that when it comes out among all the other, my gosh, games to catch up on this year.
2730992	2733574	By the way, quick follow-up to the last story we were talking about.
2733714	2737416	I just decided for Chits and Giggles to go to RedOctane.com.
2738077	2741919	It now forwards you automatically to the GuitarHeroStore.com.
2742139	2743200	It did for the longest time.
2743220	2744340	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2770809	2776973	Anyhow, let's travel around the globe and check out some upcoming release dates for things on systems you will be able to get.
2777653	2787839	Yes, this week, in fact today, you can pick up your Wii Remote in blue or pink just in time for Valentine's Day.
2789060	2791602	And so that you know what sex your Wii Remote is.
2794303	2798445	On the Wii will be Data East Arcade Classics coming out this week.
2798925	2802367	So you can get your BurgerTime and your Bad Dudes on.
2802547	2803128	Well, that's cool.
2803148	2804828	Is that coming out on any other systems or just Wii?
2804948	2805249	Just Wii.
2806229	2806449	Huh.
2807130	2808410	Are you a bad enough dude to say the president?
2808430	2809291	I was going to say Bad Dudes.
2811388	2815910	And it also has the BurgerTime sequel on there.
2816951	2818371	I've played the BurgerTime sequel.
2819972	2827996	Well, it's a typical sequel to an arcade game where the original was more fun in your memories than the sequel was.
2828896	2833019	Dynasty Warriors Strike Force coming out this week on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
2835561	2843026	SOCOM US Navy SEALS Fireteam Bravo 3 finally making its way out after quite a few delays on PSP this week.
2843306	2848029	Aliens vs. Predator coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and PC.
2849090	2855694	Jayma will be happy to know that Ragnarok, formerly known as Ragnarok Online, will be making its way out for the DS this week.
2855996	2857597	Yay, playing it in English.
2858698	2862080	Tropico 3, coming out on Xbox 360 this week.
2862820	2867082	Ace Attorney Investigations, Miles Edgeworth, making its way out on the DS.
2868263	2875507	The sequel to the music-making game, Korg DS 10+, making its way out on the DS.
2875687	2877248	Is that like Korg is in the keyboard?
2877368	2877889	Yes, it is.
2878069	2878509	Sweet.
2879210	2883172	Chicken Riot, a budget shooter game coming out on the Wii.
2884833	2884933	Um...
2886758	2887620	Let's see here.
2891127	2893192	Free Running, making its way out on the Wii.
2894775	2894995	And...
2898389	2922396	Deadly Premonition coming out on Xbox 360 this week kind of a budget survival horror game and the PC collection of Strong Bad's cool game for attractive people making its way out as well and looks like a re-release of the oh no actually this may be the original Fallout Fallout trilogy on PC for $14.99 not bad
2924747	2925127	That's it.
2941997	2950244	Dante's Inferno makes its way, a version for Japan coming out this week on the 18th, as well as Eat Lead, the return of Matt Hazard coming out on the 360.
2950625	2955889	Heading on over to the PlayStation 3, of course you also get Biohazard 5 there, but they call it the Alternative Edition.
2956610	2960813	I don't know if this is just simply a price reduction or if they were adding something to it.
2960873	2963876	It might be the Gold Edition that's coming out over here in March.
2964156	2964636	I think it is.
2964977	2967419	So it's like the, you know, souped up a little bit.
2967879	2970983	Also, of course, Eat Lead and Dante's Inferno, also on the PS3.
2971123	2978132	Also on the PS3, something that had a demo here in the States this week, Heavy Rain, the origami killer, comes out on the 18th in Japan.
2978613	2984120	Also in Japan, Shin Sangoku Mosu Online, Kamishu Rambu comes out.
2985141	2985281	It's...
2986022	2987383	Is that Romance of the Three Kingdoms?
2987403	2988383	Yeah, I think it's nice.
2988463	2990104	Yeah, that's right.
3003411	3005053	It looks Dynasty Wars-ish.
3005273	3008015	Yeah, it has the combo meter and everything.
3008156	3013160	Probably a mix of the two because it is from Koei.
3014942	3019066	That might be their version of Strike Force or there's a Samurai Warriors game coming out.
3019687	3020448	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network,
3035546	3037547	I don't know if that one's coming out exactly.
3038487	3040607	By the way, there is a premium version of that if you want as well.
3040707	3043468	Also, quickly, big release for PS3 in Japan this week.
3043528	3044848	Skate 2 gets a price reduction.
3045008	3046709	Uncharted gets a bundle pack this week.
3047169	3049249	Next week, Demon's Souls is getting a price reduction.
3049269	3051310	That was a pretty awesome PS3 exclusive.
3051990	3055151	Nothing on the Wii this week in Japan, which is somewhat surprising.
3055191	3057451	That's because next week is a pretty big week.
3057492	3062433	They have a lot of games, including the Tales of Symphonia getting a price reduction.
3062453	3063153	That's next week, though.
3064093	3077924	PlayStation 2 of course the pickings are getting a little slimmer there on PS2 but they have a game called Last Escort Club Kotze is coming out in regular and limited editions the DS gets Yu-Gi-Oh!
3077984	3080986	5D's World Championship 2010 Reverse of Arcadia
3081738	3085761	So if you're still playing Yu-Gi-Oh!, you're in for a treat this week in Japan.
3086221	3103915	Lastly on the PSP this week, Last Escort as well, and let's see, SOCOM, Fate Unlimited gets a price reduction, Densetsu no Yushin no Densetsu Legendary Saga comes out as well.
3104355	3106697	So a lot of little games here and there on the PSP this week.
3106837	3107898	So there you go.
3108238	3109459	That does it for Japanese releases.
3110431	3112332	Well, in the UK, we've got a small list.
3112372	3116355	We have on the 18th, Puzzle Chronicles on DS and PSP.
3117175	3130643	19th, we have Ace Attorney Investigations, Miles Edgeworth, Aliens vs. Predator, Dynasty Warrior Strike Force Special, Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney, Justice for All, and Real Fishing Angler's Dream.
3133408	3134310	and that's it for me.
3135111	3143764	Alright, just a few more stories for you guys and then we're going to get to the classic video game of the week because we just wouldn't have a show here at OLR if we couldn't have our classic game of the week.
3144004	3145847	But a few new stories first, Loki.
3147415	3164290	During an acceptance speech at the Japan Media Arts Festival, Miyamoto was referring to an unannounced Nintendo hardware and at least one new Wii project he's working on, which uses the Wii Motion Plus peripheral.
3165170	3194237	and of course he didn't make any formal announcements or anything like that but apparently there is something being worked on and I guess we'll just have to wait to find out what exactly that is but I'm not surprised that there's new hardware coming I would guess probably a new handheld I know, hasn't there just been rumblings and it seems like we've had stories little hints dropped by Nintendo for quite a while now there is some type of motion enabled DSi coming out or like a DS2 or something that's going to be dumb
3196115	3199859	Well, the DS isn't a bad system.
3199879	3201041	It's just flooded with shovelware.
3201261	3206827	I'm not saying it's dumb that they're putting out another system.
3207228	3211092	The reason why I'm saying that is because they just came out with the DSi a year ago.
3211112	3211332	Come on.
3214864	3218245	Well, think about when we were transitioning into the DS.
3218405	3221306	I remember the year we were there at E3, seeing the DS.
3221366	3224487	It was our first E3, the year they showed off the DS for the very first time.
3224907	3226127	Remember what else they were showing off?
3226547	3228628	The micro advances at the same time.
3229028	3233229	And there were people saying, well, who the hell would want to buy a micro advance when they just announced the DS?
3233669	3234889	But Jamie bought one.
3235369	3237670	I do not say that I bought one.
3237770	3238250	I did not.
3238310	3239310	Oh, I'm sorry, Jamie.
3239531	3240491	Acquired one.
3240531	3241171	Acquired one.
3241331	3270800	Okay, here's the difference though between that though, whereas the DSi is being treated as a new platform, I mean they are now starting to put out DSi exclusive games and then you know, they're going to probably slowly phase out the DS stuff I guess, I don't know why they would do that because they have so many right now, but to put out yet another hardware platform that's going to be a portable system that's kind of like, what the hell, I mean say you just bought a DSi you know, and it's got a, you know
3271420	3274602	It does have feature enhancements compared to the DS.
3274662	3278965	It's not just, look, we made it smaller, or look, we made it larger, or look, we made it purple.
3279245	3282868	A camera and memory storage or whatever the DSI had.
3282908	3284589	Memory storage, download service.
3284609	3285750	I never bothered with DSI.
3285950	3287071	I barely play my DS anymore.
3287091	3287551	Well, exactly.
3287831	3288311	I didn't either.
3288391	3294375	But the thing is, if they're going to put out a motion-enabled platform as well that's not compatible with this...
3295856	3298117	Seriously, how many times are they going to get you to buy the DS?
3299058	3300818	Well, I guess, how many times did you buy the Game Boy?
3300879	3308362	Well, hasn't every Nintendo handheld just been an evolution of the previous one of some sort, and they've all kind of been backwards compatible?
3308382	3311183	Well, I think at this point they're going to have to come out with something new, like new-new.
3312084	3313584	New hardware platform, period.
3313744	3314725	Still play DS carts.
3315045	3315345	It will.
3317126	3317566	That's fine.
3318086	3318466	Whatever.
3319147	3319727	I'm not buying it.
3321104	3323605	Telling you right now, I'm not paying for another handheld.
3323625	3327448	Because they're turning into Apple, where every year there'll be something bigger and better and newer.
3330049	3331450	And I'm not touching Apple stuff either.
3332611	3337573	Alright, well here's something maybe Loki could play that is for a Nintendo system, and I think this would be pretty exciting.
3338294	3346959	It's a game being developed by Epicenter, and they have combined the games Guitar Hero and Typing of the Dead.
3347959	3350261	to bring you Rock of the Dead.
3351021	3362510	So you use a rock band or guitar hero controller on your Wii and you use it to basically kill undead by playing different fret patterns or hitting different buttons on the guitar will allow you to kill zombies.
3363391	3368194	So I don't know if that sells you guys right there, but then they also go on to say they're serious.
3368554	3372437	They've brought in some like uber nerdy star tech power into this game.
3373138	3375660	Neil Patrick Harris will be the voice of the main character.
3376440	3378642	Felicia Day will also be doing a voice
3396435	3401278	is you basically have, you know, something that is knocking off House of the Dead.
3401699	3406482	I mean, even knocking off Typing of the Dead instead of a keyboard, it's the fret buttons.
3406662	3408143	I'm sorry, there's going to be a lawsuit.
3408363	3423313	I mean, seriously, the names are too, you know, if it was like, you know, Zombie Rock or something like that, you know, the names are too similar, the presentation's too similar, the gameplay's too similar, it's going to be, they're going to have a lawsuit.
3423593	3426114	You think Sega will sue to get the name changed?
3426674	3428794	I like Zombie Rock.
3428934	3432575	I think they will sue them because, let me put it this way, this company is putting this out as a conspiracy.
3433455	3434075	They're a nobody.
3434215	3437556	I mean, they're like a really small development house.
3438736	3439257	You know what, though?
3439917	3442057	I like it when small studios have good ideas, though.
3442077	3443858	It's not a good idea.
3443898	3445378	They just ripped someone else off.
3445618	3449759	Oh, hey, typing dead would be awesome if I didn't have to find a keyboard and I could just use a guitar.
3449879	3450179	You know what?
3450199	3457223	But, though, I'll be honest that I had this discussion with someone about them doing another typing of the dead with a different peripheral.
3457583	3459405	Like, I was thinking, you know, drumming of the dead.
3460105	3462446	And I want to reiterate, Neil Patrick Harris is awesome.
3462947	3464408	Well, great for Neil Patrick Harris.
3464448	3466269	He needs, you know, money, too, to pay the bills.
3466349	3469030	But I'm sorry, it's still a rip-off.
3470495	3478961	and there's nothing... I mean, it looks exactly like... If this Rock of the Dead came out and they didn't say who made it, who would you think made it?
3479281	3479701	Sega!
3479942	3481603	Because it sounds like House of the Dead.
3481623	3482403	It looks like House of the Dead.
3482423	3483984	I would have said, yeah, Sega's getting funny.
3484365	3485145	Yes, exactly.
3485385	3487407	I mean, it's a rip-off.
3487507	3490209	And I'm sorry... It's kind of a bummer Sega didn't think of it.
3491505	3496890	It is a bummer, but at the same time, it probably won't make it out, at least not under that name.
3496950	3502415	I'll give you the honest reason I'm not interested in this game, despite the voice talent behind it, is that I'm not buying a guitar for the Wii.
3502535	3503075	Exactly.
3503916	3504977	I just have to borrow one.
3505197	3506278	Flailing.
3506358	3507099	I would totally play it.
3507579	3511082	I bought the Dreamcast keyboard for Typing of the Dead.
3511222	3514545	I love Typing of the Dead on Dreamcast, but I would totally play this too on the 360.
3516247	3517148	Flailing of the Dead.
3519781	3522722	By the way, did you know that they have the air guitar controller?
3523842	3524062	No.
3524622	3525542	I saw one at Fry's.
3525962	3526762	Sitar of the Dead?
3526902	3529503	No, an air guitar controller.
3529723	3529943	I know.
3530423	3531403	It's crazy.
3531503	3538485	It's a great idea, more power to them if they're able to launch it without a lawsuit, but I mean, seriously.
3538885	3543226	I'm trying to think, haven't there been like parody games before that were obvious play on titles?
3543266	3549187	I mean, granted, there's Dawn of the Dead and stuff like that, Day of the Dead, whatever, but
3550448	3564880	House of the Dead A zombie shooter That had a version that wasn't with a light gun It was with a keyboard And you entered in commands And it killed the zombie This is basically the same thing Except it's a guitar controller And the movie sucked
3565160	3565700	Samba de la Muerta
3593396	3622369	I'm gonna maraca the zombies to death I would play the hell out of that I would play the shit out of that game especially if Neil Patrick Harris did a voice you know what Rob maybe we should have that as a side to our LAN party have a maraca booty shaking contest going on in the other room I think Samba de la Muerte should be a dream game I don't know I'm thinking that's we should have that and of course Rod Caliber yeah but Rod Caliber has kind of already been done Samba de la Dead or whatever awesome
3624443	3626125	Anyhow, boy oh boy.
3626305	3635253	Okay, let's take a different direction here in the show and take a look at gaming's past and take a trip down memory lane to figure out what the classic game of the week is.
3636174	3644101	Because every week, DarkSakura likes to take a trip to the vault and find a game that she says, hey, you ungrateful kids, you ought to be playing this game.
3644121	3646503	And of course, she picked something from the ColecoVision this week, right?
3646684	3646844	No.
3647004	3647264	No.
3647404	3647945	Maybe next week.
3648245	3649566	I said, get off my lawn.
3650547	3656410	Alright, she said get off my lawn and then decided Go play this This should be the classic game of the week So what is your classic game of the week, DarkSakura?
3656650	3661833	Doom Doom is the classic game of the week
3662406	3664568	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
3683042	3689947	Yeah, IDDQD was, I think, God Mode, and then ID Level Skip, and then ID BFG for all the weapons and crap.
3690148	3693650	No, BFG, that was just the big fucking gun.
3693670	3694291	The big fucking gun.
3694431	3695071	KFA.
3695351	3695852	That was it.
3698050	3699011	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3715306	3725753	Um, there were also, um, this gave us a term that we had before the coining of, you know, first person shooter, I really think.
3725993	3727254	And it was Doom Clone.
3727414	3730957	How often did we use the term Doom Clone back in the day?
3732483	3735567	Oh yes, there were tons of Doom knockoff games though, tons.
3735887	3740212	But from there we had Doom 2 Hell on Earth, and by the way the first Doom came out in 93.
3740272	3743856	Doom 2 was 1994, Ultimate Doom 1995, Master Levels for Doom 2, Final Doom in 1996.
3744276	3745297	Even Doom was copying Doom.
3752165	3766015	Yeah, but now there's also Doom Resurrection that came out last year in June for the iPhone, which I haven't played, but it's a parallel to Doom 3.
3767617	3772620	Doom 4 was stated for being in production, but there's nothing out on it yet.
3774001	3775903	But yeah, it's first person.
3775943	3777444	You can get a chainsaw.
3777764	3778745	You can get the BFG.
3782066	3787070	Um, you can, um, there's just all kinds of, like, weird stuff also hidden in the game, too.
3787930	3796336	Um, like in, uh, Doom 2, you have a bunny called Daisy that's, you know, impaled on a stake, and you have to give vengeance for it and crap.
3798097	3798918	And then, um...
3800538	3802860	I mean, basically, it's just going through.
3803340	3811445	If you play it on the weakest level and then you try to get through to the last level, it doesn't let you play the last level.
3811505	3821031	I know, the screen goes black like you're... But the reason why I'm bringing up Doom is because of the...
3822992	3825673	The home hacks, the wads.
3826713	3827994	All kinds of different versions.
3828114	3830014	Like there's a Ghostbusters one.
3830895	3832915	And there was a Gatchaman one.
3833135	3834676	Aliens, Sailor Moon.
3834836	3837116	I had the Dragon Ball Z one back in the day.
3838037	3842598	It's all these people who would just go and, you know, change out the sprites and everything.
3842658	3848600	And also, also, also, the other thing was skipping to the hidden Wolfenstein level.
3849762	3855625	Wolfenstein was the game I would mod, not so much Doom, but I had the Mortal Kombat characters for Wolfenstein.
3855645	3857546	That was a lot of fun.
3857606	3862169	Honestly, I prefer them for Quake, but we had Doom first.
3863770	3873435	And I think that Doom is really the reason why we've got just the massive tons of first-person shooters that we have today.
3873695	3875836	I kind of want to play this on Xbox Live later.
3876056	3878517	Like, I want to have an epic frag fest on Doom later.
3878857	3883279	I used to play... This is actually the one... This video is from Ultimate Doom.
3884219	3891882	Which, I played quite a bit of it on the Nintendo 64, but really... This was the game I learned my appreciation for PC gaming on.
3891902	3895684	Because it was from this that I was playing Duke Nukem 3D.
3896704	3898965	You know, where you could do your own voice macros and everything.
3899205	3901826	And this was the game I learned to do deathmatching on.
3902867	3903147	You know...
3904007	3907209	On top of that, I can play Doom without getting motion sick.
3908430	3908770	Wow.
3909030	3910351	Because it's sprite-based.
3911391	3911892	Well, that's right.
3911912	3916134	You have the whole, like, sprites don't make you sick, but the real 3D rendering.
3916154	3917255	But polygons do.
3917415	3917835	Interesting.
3918823	3919464	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3935505	3948031	And going to hang out, this was, no I take that back, 94, my first year of college And going to hang out at my friend Marcy's house playing Doom Playing Doom and Phantasmagoria Do you remember that game?
3948191	3962578	Yeah, Phantasmagoria just came out on the Good Old Games website this week I don't think it's in tonight's show roll, or I don't remember if we talked about it last week But Phantasmagoria, old is new again Yeah, but you know, we were playing this in Loom, I was playing Loom when I was playing Doom
3963675	3965116	I played a crap load of Doom.
3965156	3970180	Dude, I used to call into a BBS that specialized in doing the Doom 2 networking.
3970500	3972902	So you would call into this BBS and you'd do these settings.
3972922	3973943	I don't even remember what you had to do.
3973963	3974623	It was so long ago.
3974844	3976945	And then you'd launch Doom 2 and you could actually play.
3977265	3979167	And this BBS would charge.
3979187	3982169	You'd get an hour free and then you had to pay for more hours.
3982469	3986613	So of course we'd keep re-registering new accounts and putting in fake phone numbers and stuff.
3986653	3986893	Yeah.
3987313	4009802	Well, I'll tell you, you know, that same year of school, we had our Mac Lab, and keep in mind, it was the old, you know, the big rectangle box, tall Macs with the crappy keyboards and shit, and mine had a black and white version of Doom on it.
4011132	4015633	You know, so I was playing Doom in black and white in class and getting a D in the class.
4015933	4020595	This is a great game of the week because I think especially for you younger folks out there to listen to the show.
4020635	4025436	Like I know even though we swear a lot more than we should on this show and so kids should listen to our show.
4025816	4029097	I know there's some of you in like that 16 to 17 range that listen to this program.
4029517	4035219	And if you're one of those folks, if you want to see what gaming was like when we were 16, I mean not to be all like...
4036059	4038081	I walked uphill back where I was.
4038101	4038801	But let's face it.
4038821	4039682	I walked uphill both ways.
4039702	4041843	We're getting old because we've been doing this show for eight years.
4041863	4042884	Speak for yourself.
4043505	4044345	I still get carded.
4044485	4046066	This was the game I would play when I was 16.
4046887	4051851	So if you want to see a real game that we grew up on and loved, Doom is a great example.
4051931	4055733	Now you're making me feel old because I was in college when I was playing Doom.
4056254	4058015	Doom came out when I was in 11th grade.
4058475	4058675	Yeah.
4058796	4062458	But I was playing it more when I was out of... It aged.
4062478	4063119	I didn't have... I had an...
4065180	4069463	My computer that I had was a TI and I had a Clico Atom.
4070324	4072165	I would use the school's Apple IIe.
4072305	4079330	I didn't have my own computer until, you know, at least a regular use computer until Light 95 and I was on AOL 1.5 on DOS.
4082432	4083994	I have to read this in chat real quick.
4084054	4085956	Rob D's commenting on what I said there.
4086016	4088719	I'm almost 23, but I played all this stuff when I was younger.
4088839	4091042	And then he links a screenshot from ZZT.
4091362	4095287	So I just wanted to take a moment to say hail ZZT, one of the greatest PC games of all freaking time.
4095707	4096168	We miss you.
4097938	4123531	but I do have to make a mention of it that Doom is actually one of the games that led up to one of my favorite wads and it wasn't it actually wasn't Doom but it was a Quake one but I first played a version of it on Doom and then found a much better one for Quake was Gacha Quake which was a full on fully redone Gachamon Quake
4125012	4134196	But yeah, Doom was like my thing Doom is awesome Yeah, for anyone who hasn't played it God, what planet have you been living on?
4134757	4152405	Bochikawa in our chatroom says Doom is seriously one of the best games to have lasted for this long Wow And like I was saying before And it even had a crappy movie If you are one of those younger folks that didn't get to experience this when you were a teen or whatever Seriously, go on Xbox Live and check it out
4152645	4153145	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4177422	4180104	I have a challenge then.
4180144	4181945	Let's go ahead and revive the Doomwad.
4182766	4184007	Doomwad, that's great.
4184767	4186308	I want someone to make OLR Doom.
4186428	4187029	Good luck.
4187049	4188950	Those things take a lot of work.
4189871	4191572	Someone made us a text-based game.
4191812	4192293	That's true.
4192413	4193754	We can have an OLR Doom.
4193894	4195035	I want OLR Doom.
4195055	4196376	The text game was pretty awesome.
4196816	4197576	OLR Doom.
4198877	4199237	Do it.
4199257	4202438	I don't know if I want to see my face melting and getting shot.
4202478	4203759	No, we don't use our faces.
4203919	4204619	It has to be themed.
4204639	4206220	We need to be the ones with the gun.
4206240	4209561	We're the ones with the gun, and whoever wins gets a hat homemade by me.
4209922	4210142	Yes.
4210622	4212743	And you guys know who the various enemies of OLR are.
4212863	4214904	You can put them in there.
4214924	4218085	Like Ken Kudragi will be in there with a bicycle helmet and crayons.
4222341	4224624	Some folks in chat saying, oh, Zen Thrall Zen, there it is.
4224744	4225926	No, Rob, I've tried.
4225986	4227188	I was hoping for the same thing.
4228109	4228409	Fail.
4229531	4232095	So sadly, you cannot do the keyboard on Xbox Arcade.
4233052	4236174	Alright, so that's going to do it for the Classic Game of the Week, but that was a darn good one.
4236554	4236934	Good job.
4237875	4239596	I know, I'm awesome.
4239676	4243378	We're going to take a quick break here at OLR Headquarters, but don't go anywhere.
4243418	4256145	We'll be right back with Part B, a lot of quick news tonight in Part B, as well as some news about another video game movie, Sonic 4, more details, Blur, a racing game I'm looking forward to, and a few more details on Game Room.
4256185	4259447	And are we looking at Wii's being hard to find all over again?
4259687	4261875	We're going to talk about that in part B. So don't go anywhere.
4261935	4265268	We will be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4271753	4277639	And welcome back everybody to more of Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday night, February the 14th of 2009.
4277719	4281744	It's time for part B of our episode number 355.
4282264	4289692	During the break there, we were playing some classic 8-bit songs and unfortunately you don't hear our break music on the podcast because, you know, copyright issues and all that.
4290072	4315588	but um we were playing some 8-bit songs for our uh chatters and they were kind of guessing and we had some uh let me let me just quickly name you the playlist we had because you know they're only about a minute long the NES songs were weren't that long so we did a lot of them we did a Battle of Olympus, Dr. Mario, Guardian Legend, Fashanadu, uh Kid Icarus, Crystallis, Goonies 2, Balloon Fight and then what I thought was a really tricky one Magic of Scheherazade, the town music that was a old school NES game I really liked it was kind of like
4316168	4343608	Zelda and an RPG like mixed together it was weird and then of course Metroid we had some requests in chat like I think some folks want to hear StarTropics and I saw a shout out for DuckTales too we'll try to get those at the end for our live listeners unfortunately you guys who are listening to us in the podcast we for copyright reasons can't do that although what I can do I can I can play the music and then talk over it so that's this is the magic of Scheherazade music and then I want to play like a little clip there so there you go
4344428	4345309	Anyone remember that game?
4345449	4345710	Anyone?
4346150	4346390	Anyone?
4346791	4347451	Anyone remember playing it?
4348052	4350074	Alright, that's not even on virtual console.
4350594	4354238	I think the developer who made that game probably doesn't exist anymore.
4354258	4355179	I can't even remember who made that.
4355199	4356180	Was that the Culture Brain?
4356920	4357701	I can't even remember.
4357981	4365328	Alright, anyhow, let's get into some rapid fire news tonight and then we're going to get into Twitter topics as well.
4366189	4368171	Mailbag coming up this segment as well.
4368231	4368912	Loki, start us off.
4369432	4370793	Do you like free stuff?
4370893	4373253	Because everybody does.
4373514	4373814	I don't know.
4373994	4374734	I like free stuff.
4375374	4381476	And one of the things that you can look forward to free is the old Command & Conquer games.
4381596	4382137	That's right.
4382297	4387158	EA is now offering Command & Conquer Classics, which are free to download.
4387879	4390800	And they are including...
4391440	4397464	Tiberium Dawn, Tiberium Sun with the Firestorm expansion pack, and my personal favorite, Red Alert.
4398725	4408191	And of course, I guess apparently they are easy to download, but to get them running with your modern computers, it may be a little bit tricky.
4408992	4411033	So keep that in mind.
4411533	4420499	But if you're looking to download those, apparently Big Download is the website that will have those available.
4421780	4428465	BigDownload.com Some other cool stuff, of course, the LEGO Star Wars games, very popular.
4428805	4431107	And you may be thinking, hey, what's going to happen?
4431147	4432788	And what are they going to do for the third one?
4432828	4436971	Since obviously they've ran out of the Star Wars movies.
4437011	4442255	Well, not exactly, because the third LEGO Star Wars game will actually follow the Clone Wars.
4443156	4445798	I'm assuming the movie and maybe the TV series.
4446238	4453761	It's scheduled to come out later this year, probably in the fall, just in time for holidays, and on all your favorite platforms except for the PlayStation 2.
4454941	4460123	And they're seeing some brand new battle modes, also some head-to-head combat as well.
4460883	4465885	The level editor from Indiana Jones 2 will be coming back as well.
4466725	4473127	And just some new squad commands, lightsaber slicing, lightsaber jumps.
4473767	4477410	Long Distance Jedi Attacks, and Grapple Tie-Ups and whatnot.
4478471	4479172	So that's kind of cool.
4480132	4483655	Even though I'm not really a fan of the Clone Wars series.
4484216	4484456	Oh well.
4485357	4487338	And then finally, L.A.
4487418	4495585	Noire, a game that is coming from Rockstar, will be making its way out this year in September.
4495925	4498548	It is, of course, kind of a crime drama game.
4499649	4510902	brought to you by the folks that put out Grand Theft Auto and what once was a PlayStation 3 exclusive is now of course coming out on both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4513300	4514781	So, that is it.
4542797	4543817	Now, how do you know this for sure?
4544097	4550079	Because this is somewhat of a bombshell to be dropping and part B of our show, which a lot of people probably don't listen long enough to get to.
4551180	4553600	Just listening from Square.
4553840	4556801	So I'm sure they'll announce it soon at some point.
4557142	4558962	I don't even know when the game's coming out right now.
4559002	4565124	It's still scheduled around... Do you think or do you have anything that indicates to you that it's going to be simultaneous with PS3?
4565144	4566564	It should be the same time.
4567065	4567865	It should be the same time.
4568625	4575227	but right now it's all kind of we don't even know exactly for sure when it's coming out.
4576667	4579968	Right now it's kind of hovering around June but that stuff gets delayed all the time.
4580228	4583389	That was a nice little bombshell to tuck there in rapid fire news.
4583449	4594092	No, it's just because we were talking about exclusives so I mean I don't know, it makes sense because they're going to sell a hell of a lot of Final Fantasy XIII on 360 so I'm not surprised.
4594918	4597841	All right, well, gee, it makes my iPhone stories look a little silly, but I'll try.
4614981	4615541	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4634747	4637208	Apogee's Rise of the Triad is coming to the iPhone.
4653936	4682956	and also big bombshell on the iPhone Plants vs. Zombies because Pop Crack, you know they put out a lot of addicting games Plants vs. Zombies has a date which seems strange because Apple games don't usually get dated because it's just kind of you're at Apple's mercy but for whatever reason PopCap has said it is coming out on the handheld February 15th that would be tomorrow or if you're listening on the podcast probably today or yesterday so Plants vs. Zombies on February 15th on the iPhone
4683896	4684657	There you go, DarkSakra.
4696918	4699819	Ah, that perhaps Dudley will be in Street Fighter 4.
4699959	4702000	Or Super Street Fighter 4, I should say.
4703480	4704861	So that would be pretty cool.
4705541	4707222	Even though I never used him and thought he sucked.
4707742	4709662	Although people are infuriating using him.
4710683	4714884	Mega Man 10 will have a March release.
4717925	4719766	We will have it after...
4722507	4728530	Sorry, the WiiWare version will be March 1st, PlayStation 3 will be March 11th, and Xbox 360 will be March 31st.
4729651	4735654	And then, in that batch, Rock Band is going to be getting some new tracks.
4736515	4741878	An Otis Redding track pack, which is Sitting on the Dock of the Bay, the fa-fa-fa-fa-fa sad song.
4742618	4758865	I'm sick y'all I got dreams to remember and love man and then some individual tracks all time low weightless alpha beat fascination buyer sets orchestra stray cat strut that's such a cool song and the chemical brothers let forever be and they're also available for lego rock band
4760791	4763272	Okay, how about some Twitter topics then?
4763312	4767795	If we're all done with the rapid fire stuff tonight, let's get into some Twitter topics.
4767935	4775599	Although, our computer is acting up right now and I can't even access the theme music because it's being rude.
4776419	4778060	And I don't know if our feed just went down.
4780401	4781162	We did go down.
4782102	4782642	Are we down?
4783603	4784083	We're down.
4784123	4785044	Alright, hold on guys.
4785464	4789426	Those of you listening on the podcast, we need to go ahead and just bring our feed right back up.
4796266	4796906	Okay, we're back.
4796947	4801229	We had a little bit of a live stream difficulty there, so we lost all of our listeners there for a minute.
4801389	4804011	I don't know why, but Winamp decided to crash on us.
4804552	4809915	And it's kind of an important program when we're trying to broadcast, because we use Shoutcast to send our feed over to the all-game servers.
4810295	4818761	So when we left off with the show, Jamie had just finished up her last little rapid-fire stories, talking about the Rock Band releases for the week.
4818801	4822684	I'm not sure if our live listeners got to hear that, but we know it's saved for the podcast.
4823024	4826006	So we're going to move on now and move into some Twitter topics.
4830108	4847215	of course every week we invite your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR we got a lot tonight so I apologize if I don't get to your tweet but we just have kind of a lot tonight so especially if you sent multiple tweets probably only going to read one okay TigerClaw305 sends us a tweet that says game teaches
4848445	4850686	I don't even know if I should say this with a child in the room.
4852467	4856690	Game teaches S-E-X through the eyes of a superhero.
4857070	4864274	Of course, Jillian would walk into the room right as I'm starting to read this story here.
4865495	4865795	Awkward.
4866395	4869519	Alright, so a game teaches SEX through the eyes of a superhero.
4870360	4882093	Apparently health officials in Ontario, Canada, are talking about a new video game launched Thursday that will help teenagers learn about sex through the eyes of a superhero.
4882133	4882914	He left the room, it's okay.
4883655	4887680	This is an online game, ironically, by the Middlesex London Health Unit.
4888200	4892505	It gets a player to choose a character and answer true or false questions about their activity.
4893086	4898853	You can either be a man named Captain Condom, a virgin named Wonder Badge,
4899654	4906377	or a boy named Willie the Kid who believes size doesn't matter or PowerPap, a sexually active gal.
4907118	4908759	This is worth it just for the names alone.
4909459	4918023	You have to fight the game's supervillain, the Sperminator, who's a muscular man wearing a red wrestling mask with, of course, penis arms, by correctly answering a number of questions.
4918063	4920484	If you get an answer wrong, you get shot by sperm.
4920524	4922125	What the hell kind of game is this?
4922145	4923486	The tiger called Link to us.
4923826	4925227	This is disgusting.
4927428	4929791	www.getitonlondon.com
4946286	4947086	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4972619	4974040	SSJ100, Matt linked us to this.
4974100	4978882	I don't know if any of you guys saw that new We Are The World video for the 25th anniversary or whatever.
4979022	4979522	Refuse.
4980023	4981383	It was awful.
4981663	4983024	It is awful.
4983104	4994849	Michael Jackson, seriously, if I were him, I would rise from the grave and slap, who's that guy, Lil Wayne or whatever, in the face for using auto-tune in a disgusting way on that song.
4994990	4996510	He used auto-tune on that song?
4996550	4997451	It was bad.
4998371	4999893	and just, it is bad.
5000253	5001074	It was so bad.
5001174	5002435	Well, we just know he can't sing.
5002455	5002895	It was so bad.
5002915	5003636	Like, seriously?
5004036	5008821	Like, I'm all for, you know, supporting charities and all that, but don't do it through this organization.
5009141	5013205	Like, just donate to the Red Cross or donate to one of the Haiti relief organizations.
5013465	5016468	Don't make these celebrities think they actually helped because they didn't.
5017089	5017950	That's my take on it.
5017970	5018370	I'm sorry.
5018450	5023415	I actually did buy the Haiti, Help Haiti, whatever.
5023675	5026376	Yeah, I did the little text message too when they did the telethon and so forth.
5026737	5028678	I downloaded the album on Amazon.
5028698	5029278	Oh, okay.
5029598	5034260	And Shakira is not allowed to cover The Pretenders ever.
5036141	5036442	Never.
5036782	5040303	Anyhow, SSJ100Matt didn't want us to just talk about that.
5040344	5045106	They wanted us to mention that somebody in the video, and you can't really see who because it's obscured, but it's circled here.
5045126	5048408	Well, this is actually because they're showing clips of, I believe, this is Haiti at this point.
5048728	5050969	You actually can see somebody's wearing a Fatal Fury hat.
5052930	5055192	Rock Band DLC will be more selective in the future.
5073127	5093520	hmm so apparently they're going to start to scale back maybe some of the stuff that you know because they put a lot of stuff on there maybe they're just finally realizing they're not selling as much as they used to and that there's a lot of tracks that maybe just aren't worthy of being on rock band maybe because they have the rock band network now they can kind of screen through a lot of stuff I don't know
5094986	5095306	Let's see.
5095987	5100490	Master of the Claw linked us to a YouTube, but I can't pull it up in studio because it'll be too quick here.
5100770	5102651	But it says this relates to Typing of the Dead.
5102671	5105733	Apparently there was a PC guitar battling game from 1995, but it is a short clip.
5109083	5116305	And then lastly here from Spazinator, PSN, which is better, local or online multiplayer?
5116526	5120347	I say online for one reason, the no pants rule, LOL.
5121307	5123508	So, I don't know, Loki, what do you think?
5123588	5125448	Is local or online gaming better?
5125788	5127129	I would prefer local.
5127549	5128310	Thank you for watching!
5143493	5163256	and we found out why our network is so laggy it's because we have these wonderful or I should say it was a wonderful use of company money we have these photo frames on all of our desks that pull pictures off of a website that have little event pictures from our work and stuff the web shots
5163656	5166437	Yes, and they all suck bandwidth.
5167058	5172900	And so we have like Xbox Live disconnects all the freaking time just from those stupid things.
5173060	5174001	Thankfully, they're fixing it.
5174441	5179543	But still, you know, that's why I do like System Link for that kind of stuff.
5179584	5184306	And I kind of wish Grand Theft Auto had System Link because if that was the case, we'd be still playing our modded games.
5185206	5190290	I prefer local multiplayer, but I really like online multiplayer when local multiplayer is impossible.
5191190	5198575	For example, I think I've said this on the show before, my boyfriend lives two hours away, so during the week we can't really just drive out and see each other one night.
5198915	5206721	So on the weekends we'll play Castle Crashers or something together, but during the week we play WoW online.
5206781	5210623	So I like online gaming for when in real life it's impossible.
5212745	5213145	There you go.
5213185	5214686	That was the last question for tonight.
5215446	5243152	more Twitter topics next week at twitter.com slash OLR let's get back into some more news stories we'll start off with Loki yes I'm sorry can I throw this out here real quick I'm sorry Actdeft wanted to append his tweet saying that the Rock Band article goes on to talk about how the fees that the record labels are charging for the music being on Rock Band is probably leading to them being more selective which if the record companies are going to get greedy with what ends up being promotion for their own stuff
5244492	5246414	I say let him get what's coming to him.
5247175	5248516	And that is Rock Band turning him down.
5250258	5250879	Okay, sorry, Loki.
5251199	5252501	That's all right.
5253722	5259808	So it's hard to believe that even though the Wii's been out for almost three years now that...
5261710	5263271	There's still shortages, apparently.
5263872	5268937	And some of the retailers are saying that the demand is still outpacing the supply.
5269657	5278065	And a bunch of different retailers, including GameStop, Amazon, and Newegg, have all been having issues keeping the wheat in stock.
5278245	5283550	And apparently, orders from Nintendo are just not coming in in a timely manner.
5284111	5285932	And Nintendo is saying, well...
5286593	5291456	The replenishing the Wii supply will be a challenge.
5291516	5303523	Apparently, in the short term, replenishing the Wii inventories will be a challenge, but we're doing everything we can to satisfy consumers looking for Wii to purchase.
5306445	5320292	Apparently, I guess December, it was thought that Nintendo had actually reduced Wii production going into the holiday, is from a report in December.
5321032	5325295	But, you see, here's the problem I have with this, is that...
5326635	5330678	They always say, oh, we're having trouble making the Wii's and stuff like that.
5331459	5332700	Come on.
5332720	5334061	It's like three years later.
5334121	5334962	I don't buy it either.
5335002	5340366	I'm not believing that any of those shortages from before are even... I think they were all manufactured.
5340446	5341706	Come on, this is a shortage now.
5341987	5343548	You can't put out a console.
5344348	5348031	Why aren't you putting out tons and tons and tons of consoles out there in the market?
5348071	5348331	I mean...
5349332	5352740	Are you afraid that people are just going to find them everywhere and now they're not going to want them?
5353120	5354864	I mean, I don't understand.
5354904	5358351	If your console is that good, then what's the problem with having a good supply of them?
5359682	5363545	Oh, I know, because you need to create this artificial shortage so everyone scrambles for them.
5363845	5365907	Something's up, too, and I'm calling them on it.
5366147	5370830	This is stupid that it's like three years out and they're still having these bad shortages.
5371191	5371671	You know what?
5371711	5372552	Then don't buy a Wii.
5373733	5375634	If you can't find a Wii, maybe you shouldn't buy one.
5375694	5377475	Go out and get a 360 or a PS3.
5377495	5379357	They're both much more reasonable than they were before.
5380802	5381783	James Burt
5404139	5405401	and he was 24 years old.
5405481	5412329	He illegally uploaded New Super Mario Brothers Wii to the internet and thanks to a current affair in Australia, I guess, profiled him.
5412689	5418115	He did this whole little interview there and they asked him, did you admit that what you did was quite stupid?
5419316	5423099	Apparently, Nintendo Australia is claiming that the upload of New Super Mario Bros.
5423139	5426901	Wii was snatched 50,000 times.
5427581	5436286	He got a copy from somebody who broke the street date on the game and basically saying the folks at Nintendo, it's no different than stealing anything else.
5437407	5443211	Now, let's see, James Burt will have to pay a $1.5 million fine in Australian dollars.
5443231	5444632	That's about $1.3 million US.
5444652	5446333	That was a settlement, by the way, too.
5446353	5446453	Wow.
5448213	5451054	He says it's something he's going to have to work through for the rest of my life.
5451074	5451975	That was a quote there.
5452695	5455236	Well, that's what you get for uploading stuff to the internet.
5455816	5458897	Downloading, they never seem to go after those people.
5458937	5461538	But uploaders, man, those are the guys that they go after.
5461558	5462078	You know what?
5462118	5463418	I wouldn't want to be the one that gets caught.
5463458	5464399	So remember what they say.
5464479	5465579	Don't copy that floppy.
5466819	5467099	Don't worry.
5467139	5468200	I'm not copying the floppies.
5469700	5470500	Just, you know what?
5471001	5471481	Be careful.
5473410	5477733	But you do admit, when you copy games like that, you are breaking the law.
5478113	5481895	You are copying something that's, you know, not supposed to be copied.
5482736	5484337	There's really no nice way of putting it.
5484497	5488259	But you're not, I mean... Is it a Robin Hood, steal for the rich, give to the poor thing?
5488399	5491001	I don't know, that's an ethical question, but it is stealing.
5491901	5492422	Not really.
5492662	5493964	Not by the definition of stealing.
5494004	5497969	Stealing means that possession is moved from one object to another.
5498569	5506659	For example, if you have a car stereo in your car and I somehow manage to duplicate that car stereo, you still have your car stereo.
5507380	5508802	But now I have your car stereo.
5510518	5511079	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5533397	5538799	I do feel bad for Nintendo, and this is why they're unable to put out those Nintendo systems.
5538859	5542901	If only they had sold 50,000 copies more of New Super Mario Bros.
5542961	5546022	Wii in Australia, the world would be a better place.
5546943	5547803	Wiis would be plentiful.
5548003	5548943	Everyone would be happy.
5549083	5553425	I think a lot of times, though, I bet of those 50,000 people, they wouldn't have bought the game.
5553645	5554906	I mean, that's the one thing I will say.
5555386	5560348	Maybe of the 50,000, like, 500 ever actually planned on buying the game.
5561609	5564231	A lot of people want to download stuff because it's free.
5564931	5573378	There's lots of people that download CDs that are like, oh, I don't know if I'd ever really listen to this, but hey, since I have an opportunity, I'll check this out.
5574068	5578589	I actually buy CDs and individual tracks off Amazon all the time.
5579290	5585311	I buy iTunes and regular CDs once in a while too, but what I cannot stand is import.
5585351	5590513	Very recently, I'll admit, I downloaded a CD, but that's because the CD's not out here, but it's out in another country.
5590833	5597155	I'll support the artists when they're finally released here, but in the meantime... If it's what I'm thinking of, I'm totally planning on getting that.
5597255	5598695	Yes, it is what you're thinking.
5599115	5605299	And by the way, I actually almost laid down $30 to import an Angela Aki CD, so I was close.
5605540	5606500	Okay, let me put it this way.
5607061	5609362	I think people need to realize it's a worldwide market now.
5610183	5619789	I understand that it is technically theft, but it's one of those, I guess you would say, it's not really a harmless crime, but it's
5622129	5622729	Victimless?
5623049	5624050	Victimless, I guess.
5624210	5624610	I don't know.
5624690	5627510	But you would see, I guess you could say that development houses are victims.
5627530	5631111	I know, I was going to say, how many development houses did Activision shut down this week?
5631131	5631811	Oh, okay, come on.
5631851	5633512	That is not because of piracy.
5633552	5637713	That is because they're stupid and put out 50,000 different Guitar Hero games.
5638413	5639773	Oh, boo fucking hoo.
5640253	5642994	Okay, you know, those guys got paid for making the games that they did.
5643174	5643834	And you know what?
5643854	5649576	The one development house put out the really shitty Transformers games, so I don't feel bad for them at all.
5649976	5651376	You know, Lux of Flux.
5651676	5651936	Vigilante 8
5676397	5678900	That's all that it comes down to.
5679741	5691715	Maybe I'm just being naive, but I don't pirate console games because A, I'd rather have the real thing, and B, it's kind of a pain in the ass to do.
5692275	5695759	It's actually easier for me to use something legitimate like Gamefly.
5696886	5699628	I could if I wanted to, but I have too many games I'm playing now.
5699748	5705393	So why would I bother downloading and burning off a game to just sit?
5706734	5707195	Ooh, good.
5707295	5715261	Look, I have a whole stack of games I could be playing, but I don't have time because I'm playing Borderlands or I'm playing Bioshock 2.
5716402	5719365	It's just I don't have time for that stuff.
5719802	5723125	Alright, the views and opinions expressed by the host do not necessarily... Alright, anyway.
5723425	5726607	But if you want to express your opinion, we'll take emails.
5726627	5730970	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com I'm sure some people are sitting there wanting to say their piece.
5731250	5734252	So I'm sure we'll hear more about this next week.
5735593	5737955	Moving on, I'm going to go ahead and cover this next story as well.
5737975	5739957	It has to do with the iPad.
5740937	5741977	and PopCap.
5742777	5749779	Apparently PopCap, or as I've called them before in the show, PopCrack, they do believe that the iPad will change gaming.
5750359	5753560	It's just going to take about three years and a hardware update before it's really going to happen.
5754000	5764862	This comes from the co-founder of PopCap, John Vesci, talking to Eurogamer, saying that the iPad will change gaming, it will be phenomenally successful, and it will fulfill a need consumers don't even know they have yet.
5765542	5768465	The iPad's important, but I think it's going to be more important in three years.
5768845	5771808	Look how long it took the iPod to get the momentum where everyone has one.
5771868	5775311	It's probably going to take the second generation iPad to make it really like, wow.
5775871	5778533	This is my opinion, and I think it's going to be phenomenally successful.
5778573	5779054	I really do.
5779394	5780035	It's very simple.
5780075	5782957	It's not like it has a magical set of features, just a great package.
5783378	5787981	I know what I'm getting when I have to get my mom a computer now, an iPad, because she can't screw it up.
5788102	5789303	She can't download a bunch of stuff.
5789323	5790784	That's the perfect mom computer, right?
5791084	5792905	and it's the perfect computer for 10 year olds to play with.
5792925	5796388	Again, those comments from PopCap co-founder John Vesci to Hero Gamer.
5808897	5810038	Oh, what's this attachment?
5810178	5810898	Virus?
5811278	5813119	That sounds interesting.
5813259	5820463	Well, my mom, who for the longest time didn't even know what the CD tray did in a computer, is now using email.
5820503	5822364	And I get emails from her, and it's very strange.
5822804	5824505	My grandmother's using email.
5824585	5826586	I'm worried the next time I go, she's going to be like...
5826766	5827287	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5846846	5847086	and so on.
5868435	5873560	The Apple products are not computers for complete idiots that can't understand anything.
5873840	5877703	I mean, at least that's, I hope, not the impression that they're trying to put out there.
5878484	5880085	Oh, I'm sorry, you're too dumb for PC.
5880225	5883008	You need to move to the Apple products.
5883988	5887071	Apple products, it's special ed for computer users.
5887111	5891314	Well, look, despite the choice of words he used, I think he makes a point.
5891374	5893857	It's kind of the same thing I said about the iPad a couple weeks ago.
5894597	5922420	there's going to be a new one Apple puts out new ones every year and this first version of the iPad is kind of yoink yoink but let's not forget the iPhone didn't have the apps on it when it first came out and that's what really took the iPhone to the next level the iPad will get its features it's just going to take a year I tell you if an iPad like had a video camera on the front of it so you could do video conferencing from it like over 3G and stuff oh my god it would sell like crazy and that'll be in the revision it will
5923723	5924704	Wait and see.
5924984	5928666	And then it'll change gaming because it'll have a camera, it'll have motion, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
5928686	5929406	You know what, though?
5929566	5936510	The Nintendo Wii 3 will be super awesome because it's going to have holographic graphics and it's just going to be phenomenal.
5936771	5938592	So let's just support them with that.
5938612	5944155	Well, yeah, with a PlayStation 4, it's going to vacuum the floor and do the dishes and cook me breakfast.
5946806	5947727	I mean, that's stupid.
5947767	5949148	That's a stupid argument.
5949488	5951870	Oh, well, it'll be good in three years.
5952170	5954071	Well, good for them.
5954231	5955472	It'll be good after they figure it out.
5955532	5956333	It sucks.
5957433	5958194	That's awesome.
5958214	5959375	That's an awesome argument.
5959735	5966119	Yeah, it sucks now, but eventually when they figure out that it sucks and make a better platform, then it'll be awesome.
5966760	5967600	No, it won't.
5968161	5970422	It'll still suck, and then they'll come out with something else.
5970522	5971083	It'll be better.
5971223	5972944	One step closer to the holodeck.
5973124	5975546	Gaming always takes us one step closer to the holodeck.
5976492	5977613	Such a stupid argument.
5977633	5978253	I'm sorry.
5978933	5979894	Stupid PopCap.
5980934	5983355	You make your addicting little games and be done with it.
5983556	5985076	We don't need your opinion out there in the marketplace.
5985096	5987738	I'm telling you, Bejeweled Blitz, seriously, crack.
5988298	5989538	Seriously, crack.
5989619	5994221	Okay, and I give them props for making addictive casual games that sell like crazy.
5995419	5999862	At the same time, they have no fucking clue what platform works well out there.
6000402	6001242	I mean, come on, man.
6001363	6004744	It is just a large iPod Touch.
6005485	6007126	That's all it is.
6007886	6009327	Let the man have an opinion.
6009367	6009807	Whatever.
6009867	6012689	It'll be phenomenal later on when the new version comes out.
6012709	6018352	Well, that's awesome, but by that time, they're going to come out with something else, and people are going to totally forget about the iPad.
6018372	6020053	Where every gamer has a voice, Loki.
6020353	6020874	Every gamer.
6022748	6023208	Whatever.
6024329	6026529	Alright, Loki, what do you have for us next with news?
6026889	6029790	God, it's so frustrating.
6031071	6033712	Well, apparently they're making movies about anything nowadays.
6033892	6039154	That's especially the case when it comes to licensing movie or games into movies.
6039174	6045556	Speaking of which, you know, half these games that get licensed into movies, it's like, where the hell are they?
6045616	6048337	Like, for example, Clock Tower, where the hell is that?
6049077	6052098	I mean, shit, they're making movies based on Battleship.
6052486	6055325	Wasn't there supposed to be a Silent Hill 2 movie at some point too?
6055808	6059791	Oh yeah, I'm sure after they're done churning out remakes.
6059811	6061292	There's supposed to be a new Clue.
6062213	6064935	They keep saying it's a remake of the 80s one, but it's not.
6065175	6067617	That is scripture to me.
6067657	6070119	You do not remake Clue from the 80s, okay?
6071140	6074743	But they're going to do Battleship and whatever.
6075103	6076444	No, and Monopoly.
6076824	6078225	Oh yeah, there's a Monopoly movie.
6078365	6079666	You can't.
6080407	6081868	I'd like to see a Yahtzee movie.
6082328	6083189	Go fish.
6085851	6088734	A movie about an old maid.
6088754	6089615	It's awful.
6089755	6091497	Her pairs of friends.
6091798	6100427	Speaking of awful, one of the games that they decided to or I guess the developer of said game is looking to license it into a movie.
6100447	6101468	Kind of the opposite of where...
6102749	6110857	Darkest of Days is a game based off of these futuristic soldiers that go back in time to save certain people from different wars.
6111158	6113220	So basically it's time cop again.
6113980	6117884	You go back in time and you kill people and whatnot.
6120071	6129867	So now they're looking at... I guess the writers of The Rock are attached to craft the screenplay.
6129927	6134434	So hey, that could be kind of cool, because they wrote a pretty good screenplay for The Rock, but...
6136997	6144320	The good thing about this, though, is the premise is interesting enough where most people won't even realize it's a game tie-in.
6144500	6149001	In fact, it's a good thing that they don't associate it with the game at all.
6151362	6152542	Can they make a movie out of this?
6153002	6153882	Do you think it would be any good?
6153922	6155363	Yeah, it's vague enough to where it works.
6155423	6157183	It's people going back in time killing other people.
6157484	6158864	That sounds interesting enough.
6160686	6188753	Alright, too bad the game didn't have more of an impact Moving on to a game that probably will have more impact We talked a lot about this last week, Sonic the Hedgehog 4 But the news had just recently came out when we did the show So a little more has developed, including a rumor going around That Sonic the Hedgehog 4 may actually be out in retail Once all of the episodes come out on the various networks Sort of like what they did with Grand Theft Auto 4 They had the download content and then they released it to retail
6189913	6190994	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6215131	6216392	DarkSakura, what do you think of the petition?
6242955	6243696	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6260803	6265506	DarkTetsuya says, Nah, they'll just charge for DLC to reskin them.
6265527	6268028	Sad, but probably true.
6287622	6288002	Let's see.
6288303	6291264	Blades of Steel says, yeah, internet petitions don't work.
6291805	6299489	And Rei Ayanami, I love this comment, says, Sonic, I'm really happy for you and I'm going to let you finish, but Twilight has one of the dumbest fan bases of all time.
6302270	6303211	Take from that what you will.
6305312	6305492	Yeah.
6305872	6307033	Hey, let's go to the mailbag.
6312481	6318704	Every week we invite you guys to send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we read a few of your favorites here on the show.
6319144	6325286	Since DarkSakura is having voice issues tonight, I'm going to go ahead and relieve her of her mailbag duties and I'll read the mailbag for her.
6325907	6330088	So again, send us your emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com We just have a couple emails this week.
6330789	6335590	Not a whole lot to read tonight, but I do want to read these couple quick emails that we have in the mailbag.
6336631	6339072	We're going to start it off with an email from...
6341386	6345987	I don't see a signature, so I'll just say Sam S from the email header.
6346647	6347047	Sam says,
6366152	6394763	so far for 2010 even though we missed like two weeks of show just because there wasn't an actual show I'm pretty good about getting them up in 24 hours so I'd like to pat myself on the back here's a much longer email tonight from the name Molten Brown one of my favorite nicknames that we have out there hey guys it's Molten Brown again yes despite the humor over the name last time I wrote in I decided to keep it well good for you you stick by what you believe in Molten Brown
6395543	6400564	I listened to your podcast from last week when you touched on the issue of developers' rights again and I wanted to weigh in.
6401005	6409107	It's my first year of law school and other than making me more cynical about the legal system as a whole, I am realizing how many different things affect the outcome of a lawsuit.
6409487	6414348	Disclaimer, I could be completely wrong and I accept that, but this is my opinion based on what I know.
6415068	6415529	Fine by me.
6415549	6416669	I'm welcoming of all opinions.
6417426	6423229	And honestly, I don't think the developers would have a chance against the companies unless they banded together, and even then it would be questionable.
6423689	6430352	I know the DarkSakura feels that if you don't do anything about a bad situation, you are helping to create the situation, and I agree with her in part.
6430872	6435514	But I also realize that the game companies are going to have a lot more money to defend themselves than the developers.
6435954	6444458	And this affects how good of lawyers they can get, what the lawyers can do on their case, whether the lawyer can devote more time to the case or has to juggle multiple clients at the same time.
6444898	6445519	Thank you for watching.
6460174	6462596	Going Through Discovery, and all the other steps of process.
6463057	6469122	Developers may not have the monetary means to defend themselves with the law, so even if they wanted to, it might not be possible.
6469542	6470343	And that sucks.
6470924	6477249	Sorry for being a downer, but I wanted to shed some light on some of the other issues developers may face that prevent them from doing anything.
6477629	6479511	And Molten Brown signs his email.
6479911	6482073	This email has been brought to you by Sleep Deprivation.
6482394	6483835	Need a ready excuse for screwing up?
6483915	6485897	Sleep Deprivation may be the thing for you.
6487037	6489959	DarkSakura, any comments on the other perspective there?
6490440	6491580	No, I agree with it.
6492121	6505129	I just still think that if it's still, I think that people need to put the effort into, this is why I'm thinking it would be something like along the lines of a class action lawsuit.
6506649	6515737	Well, I kind of suggested this a couple weeks ago, and I realize this is a polarizing topic, and I don't want to get too political, but I just want to throw that idea out there and see what sticks.
6516458	6516818	Unions.
6517399	6523564	What if there was, like, a union for game developers that they kind of banded together and then maybe could afford some of these things?
6523604	6524065	You know what I mean?
6524425	6528809	Like, granted, then you get all these, like, the dues that goes with it, but at least there would be, like, a union to fight for rights.
6529429	6532772	But look, I realize it's a polarizing topic, but I just want to throw the idea out there.
6532832	6533073	I mean...
6533653	6535414	Can you tell me what's right or what's wrong with that idea?
6535434	6536294	I think it's a good idea.
6536314	6542536	It's just the whole point that it's sad that we're dealing with, you know, that level of corruption, I think, in the system.
6543536	6545577	So if you want to continue this debate next week, that's fine.
6545637	6550899	But if you're going to email us on this topic again at mailbag at orangelounge.com, I really want to hear your thoughts on the whole union idea.
6550939	6553300	Good idea, bad idea, whatever idea.
6553920	6555281	That was really it for emails this week.
6555341	6559382	Mailbag at orangelounge.com if you want to send us more emails.
6560698	6561739	What was that, DarkSakura?
6561859	6563760	We're having a child meltdown in the other room.
6563780	6564341	Yeah, I can hear.
6564361	6567123	It's alright, we're going to still try to continue with the show.
6568184	6570867	After the mailbag, we always like to take a minute to say F.U.
6571307	6572648	to things that are making us angry.
6572708	6574550	It's a little segment we call the F.U.s of the week.
6590714	6592317	DarkSakura, do you have any angst for us tonight?
6592517	6593098	Being sick.
6594120	6594400	Loki.
6596884	6597805	Not really, actually.
6598306	6599127	I don't have anything.
6601591	6601792	Really?
6601832	6602693	You're just in a good mood?
6602733	6603314	Everything's happy?
6603835	6604937	I'm in a complacent mood.
6605558	6606139	Oh, good to hear it.
6607560	6609082	I don't really have a lot of FUs either.
6609102	6610603	I feel like I should have something.
6611104	6615148	I'll just give another FU to moving and having to get everything in boxes and all that good stuff.
6615488	6618551	I'm not looking forward to moving, but at least it'll be over after this week.
6618932	6620013	Oh, and an FU to my car.
6621515	6624918	There's always a new surprise when it breaks down in my car, and today it's the air conditioner.
6626119	6626439	Goodie, goodie.
6640104	6640504	Fun time.
6640584	6641805	It's going to do it for the FUs of the week.
6643065	6643345	All right.
6644045	6646106	Let's move on with some more news stories.
6646126	6647166	Just a couple more for you guys.
6647186	6652228	Then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
6652668	6658970	Do remember, if you're going to use the Skype client to actually call us, call Echo123 first if you've never been on the show before.
6659450	6662351	Even if you have been on the show before, you might just want to double check that you're okay.
6662831	6662991	Loki?
6663673	6675736	During the 2009 fiscal earnings report from Activision, CEO Michael Griffith noted that Bizarre Creations would be doing a multiplayer beta for Blur next month.
6676136	6683197	They didn't specify when exactly it's going to be, but at least it'll be on...
6689136	6689616	The Xbox 360.
6690036	6691537	Well, that's stupid.
6691557	6694439	They didn't say what platforms the games are coming out on.
6695399	6696900	PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
6697480	6700982	But no word on which platform they're actually going to do the beta for.
6702443	6703503	Well, I'm excited for Blur.
6703523	6706165	It was one of my favorite things we saw at E3 last year.
6706205	6707745	It's Mario Kart meets Burnout.
6707925	6709126	I think that's why I was calling it before.
6709326	6709766	It'll be neat.
6710006	6710227	I know.
6710247	6710987	I'm excited for it.
6712231	6715414	Alright, and the last story I have for you guys tonight has to do with Game Room.
6715454	6717436	Of course, I'm pretty excited about Game Room.
6717476	6718396	I love my classic games.
6718837	6722260	And there are some more tidbits coming out of the X10 event when it comes to Game Room.
6723100	6726944	Apparently, five to seven games a week are supposed to be added for download.
6726984	6727924	That's what they're claiming.
6727964	6729626	We'll see if it becomes a reality or not.
6730226	6735431	They want to do like a weekly release on a particular day, kind of like what they do for Rock Band or the Xbox Live Arcade.
6736091	6739154	Right now, they're looking at Thursday, but that could change.
6740194	6744876	Also, apparently they're going to add some incentives for you to get games the day that they come out.
6745356	6750859	So if you buy a game the day it comes out, it will be a special item that stays with you in your personal game room.
6751819	6758062	One of the things that the game room producer Fred Norton was showing off was a helicopter that flew around the player's avatar.
6758702	6760963	The day one exclusives would be different for every game.
6761263	6764785	It would somehow tie into the game's iconography.
6764865	6765505	So like, you know,
6766185	6776692	and if you really watch that Game Room trailer you can see like a little yellow dragon from Adventure rendered in 3D which I know sounds weird but it's like walking around the little playhouse.
6777013	6780095	I bet it would be little things like that that you're going to get for day one releases.
6780715	6781275	I would imagine.
6782536	6786277	So have they mentioned how you're going to be able to go to like friends game rooms and stuff like that?
6786297	6789478	Because what's the point in decorating your own game room if only you see it?
6789678	6790538	No, they haven't.
6790578	6794259	And I'm thinking I wouldn't get too excited about this.
6794319	6798400	I think it's just going to be that you have your game room and you can go look at others' games room.
6798480	6800541	I would think that you would at least be able to play a demo.
6800821	6801521	But you know what it is?
6801621	6803862	It's going to be the way for them to solicit the quarters.
6804422	6808443	You probably will do a lot of your 40 Microsoft Point play or your 50 cent play.
6808863	6818429	visiting other people's game rooms I think that's the whole idea behind it is go visit your friends game rooms and try out their machines for 40 points at pop I bet you that's what it is
6820020	6821021	So we'll see though.
6821241	6828125	There's still a ways to go before the end of March when Game Room is expected to come out and hopefully our questions will be answered by then.
6828906	6832688	So that does it for the scheduled stories we have tonight.
6833008	6834869	We're going to go ahead and go to the Skype line.
6834929	6844275	First though, before we get to the Skype line tonight, I want to play this voicemail because this is about something we probably haven't talked enough about on the show, but it is a big thing going on on our website right now.
6844315	6845716	So let me play this voicemail first.
6848385	6851646	Hi Rob, this is Brett Wall from Undersedation Live.
6852126	6860709	Our show's on hiatus, so I'm leaving a voicemail to Orange Lounge Radio reminding all of your listeners to participate in QSL Madness.
6861029	6861909	I'm getting distracted.
6862289	6865010	But we're in the round of 64 right now.
6865030	6867071	There's some fantastic matchups going on.
6867231	6870532	All you need is a form account and a hand to click your mouse with.
6871572	6872733	It's all in our form.
6873153	6875734	They're at www.orangeloungeradio.com.
6875754	6876714	Be sure to visit and
6877259	6879761	Hello to everybody out there in Orange Bond Radio Land.
6879921	6881263	We missed you on USL.
6881343	6882864	Anyways, talk to you later.
6883044	6883745	Bye.
6884666	6886908	Thank you very much, Bressel, from Under Station Live.
6886968	6887969	I didn't know they were on hiatus.
6887989	6888629	What's going on there?
6888970	6891111	I thought I saw a tweet about it, but I don't know.
6891151	6894034	Sometimes Travis threatens to go on hiatus, but then doesn't really go on hiatus.
6894054	6895916	So I hope everything's okay over at USL Land.
6896316	6896997	So whatever.
6897677	6899359	I hope you guys get better or whatever's going on.
6899999	6908165	But yes, Under Station Live Madness, the big battle to figure out the greatest video game of all time is going on right now on the Orange Lounge Radio forums.
6908625	6910747	It's kind of some surprising things going on there.
6910827	6916031	Like I kind of lost my shit and got angry when Time Crisis beat Civilization, which I think is a travesty.
6916731	6918793	But whatever, I'll leave my opinions on the forums.
6920094	6945693	You can vote for whichever game you like more And then they kind of whittle their way down It's kind of modeled after a March Madness NCAA kind of thing To the greatest video game of all time Which Super Metroid won one year I think Mario 3 won it last year And so we'll see who wins this year There's a bunch of stuff going on on the forums right now So if you haven't checked that out, check that out on the forums At OrangeLoungeRadio.com There's a whole little March Madness section there So take a look
6946624	6951646	Alright, we're going to go to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
6951666	6953287	We're now open for business on the Skype line.
6953347	6955948	Go ahead and give us a call if you'd like, and we'll take some calls.
6956928	6957909	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
6957929	6958269	Who's this?
6959309	6960690	This is DSMaster26.
6960810	6962811	Hey, DSMaster, what's on your mind?
6964971	6966552	Not much.
6966892	6973575	I participated in the finale of 1 vs. 100, which was perceived to be a Halo game.
6976683	6977023	Really?
6977483	6978324	Did that happen tonight?
6978404	6979944	Was the 1 vs. 100 finale tonight?
6981165	6983626	No, it was two days ago.
6984486	6985147	So what did they do?
6985207	6986847	What made it such a Halo fangasm?
6986907	6987348	I missed it.
6987388	6989068	I forgot that the season was coming to an end.
6990049	6995151	They had two of the creators from Halo 3 and 3 of it.
6995531	6998332	Actually, the creators of the whole series on there.
6999273	7004115	Talking about the Halo series and Halo Legends being on
7013679	7017141	Was there any mention of the whole news about Xbox Live?
7017161	7023966	Because I know this just happened a couple weeks ago about original Xbox Live shutting down for original Xbox and how that will impact Halo 2.
7024186	7024966	Did that come up at all?
7027128	7028649	I did not talk about that.
7029629	7031611	I guess that doesn't really surprise me.
7031651	7033292	I just kind of wondered if that would come up at all.
7033633	7036875	Did they say anything during the finale about the next season of 1 vs. 100?
7039297	7046043	They said there is definitely going to be Season 3, but they don't know exactly when it's possibly going to start.
7046063	7050326	Damn, it's cold in Nebraska.
7051127	7051287	Yeah.
7054148	7055549	And the sky is blue.
7055569	7056009	What else is new?
7056029	7058011	I got a little bit of a news announcement for you guys.
7058031	7066918	Because the broadcasting class from the Career Center over here in Omaha, Nebraska is coming all the way to Anaheim, California.
7068279	7068599	All right.
7068940	7069420	Wait, wait.
7069460	7071361	I got to take it back to 1 vs. 100 for a minute here.
7071702	7073003	What do you want to see in Season 3?
7074964	7075224	Huh?
7076345	7077907	What do you want to see in Season 3 of 1 vs. 100?
7077947	7078007	Ooh.
7082970	7088117	Um, probably them to try to get... Oh, God.
7088217	7091682	Probably the guys behind DJ Hero or something like that.
7092483	7092704	Like...
7093382	7097726	Oh, and actually, that same night with the Halo guys, Jimmy Fallon popped in once or twice.
7118717	7119918	He was definitely funny.
7119938	7120919	He also plays 1 vs. 100.
7120979	7121119	Ooh.
7121139	7121300	Well...
7142574	7152119	There are three game shows in my mind that would be really good for Xbox 5 and that same spiel that 1 vs. 100 is going at.
7153059	7154620	Sorry, but not really.
7154880	7156701	Deal or no deal, no.
7156941	7157662	That's a no-go.
7158882	7161263	Probably Who Wants to be a Millionaire, that'd be good.
7161283	7163885	That was a video game years ago.
7164025	7164425	Good idea.
7166885	7174547	I do also give a big fat no to Deal or No Deal because I hate that game show.
7174667	7175927	I think it's a terrible game show.
7176187	7182149	It's the worst game show, one of the worst they've ever done because Deal or No Deal takes absolutely no skill.
7182269	7183929	There is zero skill involved.
7184129	7188190	Speaking of Deal or No Deal, you know those ticket redemption games, right?
7188530	7189450	Yeah, I've played it.
7189470	7191171	They need a deal or no deal for that now.
7191611	7192472	I've played it.
7192612	7193732	I hate to admit, I've played it.
7194452	7202115	My friend, it wasn't me, but one of my friends actually got all the way down to opening the final case and won the jackpot.
7202195	7202735	I was amazed.
7204296	7208457	But then I also wasn't because I was like, she just got lucky because there's no skill involved.
7209918	7211399	There are two game shows in my mind.
7212119	7214720	Would possibly have to be like Wheel of Fortune.
7214740	7215640	That'd be pretty good.
7216841	7217021	And...
7218547	7219788	Hollywood Squares.
7220728	7222269	Hollywood Squares I'd be down with.
7222289	7223109	That would be pretty funny.
7223129	7224550	You could totally do the prices right.
7224990	7225650	I know you could.
7225890	7226830	You could, but they won't.
7227151	7229752	All right, well, DS Master.
7230012	7240496	Just to let you know, I don't know what ear to my phone or something, but the audio when you're speaking on my end, like you're sounding a little bit crackly.
7240516	7242557	I don't know what's up.
7243077	7244678	It's demons in the phone system.
7247489	7247850	Damn.
7248251	7249553	All right, have a good night, DS Master.
7250495	7253581	All right, you too, and happy Valentine's Day, all our crew.
7253962	7254223	Later.
7255729	7277701	I don't know what that is it's always going to sound a little weird over our little rigged setup here but do remember if you do call OLR turn your volume down a lot so that you don't get picked up in fact it's even best to turn it off or mute it or something just keep that in mind 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype Orange Lounge Radio on Skype Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?
7279182	7282104	Hi this is Spazinator Hi Spazinator what's on your mind?
7284608	7289772	You know, well, one issue is kind of a compound issue.
7290832	7298137	I don't know if you saw my one tweet from earlier, but I kind of want to take Sony to ask about a problem that I'm having.
7298637	7299417	Please do.
7300618	7311965	Yeah, my initial problem is my PlayStation 3 just last weekend got the dreaded yellow light of death.
7312981	7313682	Uh-oh.
7315363	7328272	Yeah, I'm sure you, DarkSakura, and Loki all know what that is.
7328393	7331455	I wouldn't bother explaining it.
7331735	7337279	So are you just mad about the yellow light, or did something happen in trying to get it fixed?
7339901	7341622	Using so much the
7343191	7344491	the Joe White Adults.
7345311	7352773	I know that systems fail and I can always, you know, and I plan on taking it to Sony to every fix.
7353253	7354753	There isn't so much a problem.
7355513	7372917	Where the problem lies is that when I explained the situation to one of the Sony reps and told them that I didn't need to send my system in for repairs, I need to explain to them that I have two profiles on my system and one of which is for gaming and one is
7373464	7375485	for purchasing movies and TV shows.
7376946	7381689	And I have a lot of video content that I purchased through the store.
7382949	7396657	And I was concerned about being able to play the videos that I purchased once I get the system back because they get really wonky DRM.
7397798	7401240	And to paraphrase what the one rep said,
7402329	7406982	There's like a 50-50 chance that you may lose all your content.
7409246	7410847	A 50-50 chance?
7411267	7414009	What the hell kind of advice is that?
7414069	7414790	That's weird.
7415690	7417812	I interpret that as there's a zero chance.
7417852	7420073	They're giving you false hope and that's pretty disgusting.
7420674	7424476	And I remember you went through this whole mess not that long ago.
7425337	7429780	You lost all your DRM to video content and you finally got it.
7429800	7432401	I remember you called us and we said, don't take no for an answer.
7432441	7433102	You keep calling back.
7433382	7435664	And finally you were able to get some of it back.
7435744	7437545	But it sounds like they're running you through that gauntlet again.
7439006	7440406	Yeah, yeah, exactly.
7441567	7464355	My line of thought is to follow with what you just said, is that I paid through the nose for all this content, you know, two to three bucks per TV episode, you know, I got a whole shit ton of them, plus $10 to $15 per movie.
7467206	7472170	And I get like hundreds and hundreds of videos, so needless to say, that's a lot of money.
7473170	7478835	And, you know, I expect that since I pay for all this stuff, I should be able to use it.
7479716	7488663	And, you know, right now I have a hardware failure, you know, which I have to send my machine into a repair bus.
7489481	7495804	Once I get the machine repair, I should be able to play the content that I purchased.
7496484	7514351	Spazator, please keep us posted with what happens after the repair and everything, or which side of the 50-50 or whatever you end up on, because if you do lose your access to all that and they don't do anything about it, I want to help put it out there in the public, because everybody needs to think twice about buying something.
7514671	7520915	A damn thing from Sony if, you know, this is the way they're going to treat it as like, well, there's a 50-50 chance it might still work.
7521336	7522957	This is why people hate DRM.
7523457	7527400	And if they're going to leave the door wide open like this, people need to know to not support it.
7527800	7537087	And I would really encourage you that if Sony does not do the right thing, does not satisfy you, does not leave you a satisfied customer, stop buying stuff on the marketplace.
7537167	7538107	I know that's going to be painful.
7538187	7539028	I know you use them a lot.
7539268	7540569	But you're going to have to explore alternatives.
7540589	7541069	You have to.
7541249	7541930	You owe it to yourself.
7543564	7558515	Yeah, what I got planned for your time being, which I already mentioned, on Twitter and Facebook is I never set my system in just yet because I'm waiting on a check from a Social Security Disability P.E.
7558675	7561557	to cover the cost of the repairs.
7562238	7563859	But once I do get that check...
7565837	7566238	Good idea.
7566258	7573388	Spaznier, we're going to have to wrap up so we can get to some more calls, but please keep us posted on what happens.
7583365	7583745	I'm sure.
7583865	7584226	Will do.
7584426	7584686	Alright.
7585526	7586187	You too, Spadina.
7586227	7586807	Take care, buddy.
7587047	7587287	Good luck.
7587307	7587927	Let us know what happens.
7589208	7590949	Man, that is irritating.
7591109	7592870	I would be so mad if I was him right now.
7593711	7595371	And I love what Brad is saying here in chat.
7595391	7597753	And again, we don't know what the end result's gonna be, so we'll see.
7598053	7602755	But Brad says in chat, shit like this is why I just torrent my video content.
7602835	7605897	Dude, Loki was just having this whole spiel on piracy earlier.
7605957	7607038	Like, this is it right here.
7607398	7609039	Like, people pirate because of DRM.
7609179	7610960	And if you want to know legitimately...
7611560	7617864	Why there might be a fraction of a reason to support piracy, listen to Spassinator's call.
7617985	7627611	If his thing comes back and none of his content works again, I'm going to be like, dude, you should be pirating things on the PlayStation marketplace because that's the only way you're going to get around the DRM.
7627631	7629753	I don't see why it wouldn't work because...
7630854	7633175	It's tied to his account, not his system.
7633496	7634456	Well, he had the problem before.
7634737	7638199	But, dude, can you believe a rep told him there's a 50-50 chance you're going to lose it all?
7638219	7640421	Well, there's stupid people working for all companies.
7640661	7642383	It's like saying, I might like you and I might not.
7642703	7643003	I don't know.
7643063	7646006	As a customer service trainer, that irritates me.
7646606	7647967	Call back and talk to a different rep.
7649048	7649889	Let's get to another call.
7649929	7650970	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7650990	7651330	Who's this?
7652151	7652571	Good morning.
7652651	7654292	This is from the west coast of Sweden.
7654332	7655213	This is Judith speaking.
7655393	7656034	Well, hello.
7656394	7657795	Another Swedish listener?
7657835	7658636	Do you know Ake Ripper?
7659471	7663712	No, I don't know him, but I heard him on the last episode, I think he called in.
7664272	7665873	And I've heard him a bunch of times.
7666173	7669213	So I figured I'd try and get on and represent Sweden.
7670194	7672554	Hey, we're all about... Dude, we're like getting bigger than ABBA.
7672834	7673514	Alright, no, alright.
7675215	7676755	So to what do we owe this phone call tonight?
7676775	7677275	What's on your mind?
7677975	7678736	I have a couple of things.
7678876	7679616	First, I would like to...
7680596	7686623	Do like a shout out to the person who directed me to Orange Lounge Radio and got me to start listening to it.
7687183	7688264	And that's Dalit.
7688525	7691207	It's D-A-L-33-T.
7692709	7698435	I don't think he's ever called in or been on the chat, but I just want to give him a big thank you and hopefully he hears this and gets back to me.
7698715	7706920	Dalit, thank you for being Leet because we always do say at the end of the show if you like Orange Lounge Radio tell a friend or two about the show and help us spread the word.
7707000	7710562	Clearly Leet has done that and gets a gold star for his efforts.
7710602	7710922	Thank you.
7711663	7713224	And happy first call to the show.
7713604	7714985	Yes, and happy first call to the show.
7715615	7716815	Hopefully I'll have many more.
7717776	7718696	And I also have a question.
7719416	7727058	You had talked a bit about piracy before, and it's such a big concern, and there's been a lot of talking about it in the chat.
7727998	7729078	What should they do to prevent it?
7729119	7739101	Should they have more DRM, less DRM, more extreme DRM, like maybe having to take a photo of your receipt and then send it in and have to call in and then have it activated online?
7739201	7742122	Or what should companies do to prevent piracy?
7743623	7744764	I don't think there's an easy answer.
7744804	7748165	I think if that answer were out there, it would probably be being done right now.
7748225	7749226	Of course.
7749446	7752707	It's not easy to solve, but how should they go about trying to solve it?
7752807	7753348	What approach?
7754248	7756229	More restrictions or more freedom?
7757893	7761316	I'm not a fan of the program-based DRM.
7761536	7765980	I prefer activation codes, though they are easier to bypass.
7767100	7778750	But for an example of it being effective, when I was given Guild Wars as a present and my activation code had been scratched off, I couldn't find a generator, I couldn't do anything.
7779290	7785237	I actually took a photo of my code and gave them the serial number off of my box.
7785357	7796410	They sent me a new code and that to me I think is less frustrating than having to deal with something that's going to install on your system or having to re-download things.
7796990	7797470	I think we're
7823695	7825497	That's where things are going to go.
7825717	7827138	Do I think they should go there?
7828079	7830341	Maybe not, but that's where they're going to go.
7832302	7837627	I always miss the old, you have to look in the manual to look at the faces or match things up.
7838368	7841150	That's how they used to do the old PC stuff back in the day.
7841190	7843432	Yeah, but that stuff, you can photocopy that.
7843552	7844613	I know, but I miss that stuff.
7844833	7857943	Okay, here's my real answer, though, is that I think one way that they could do it is, it's kind of one thing they're doing, is it's kind of one of those fight fire with fire, is that the publishers themselves go out on these torrent sites and put the games up for download, but they're borked versions.
7858303	7861506	Like the whole, you remember, Arkham Asylum was crippled.
7861526	7862887	And Mirror's Edge and stuff like that, yeah.
7862927	7863147	Yeah, I...
7863447	7863987	and DarkSakura.com
7890527	7902735	So that may work in the short run, but people will find, or, you know, as in the case of Batman Arkham Asylum, people will find a way around it within like a day, and that will be done for.
7903276	7919606	So really the easiest way to do it, and unfortunately it is going to be the mandatory online activations, and it's basically going to be a code inside like a manual or something like that that they're going to have to enter into some online service to download a key or something.
7920987	7926550	or it's going to be inside the manual and you put it in the game and then people will find a key generator around it.
7926630	7929731	So no matter what they do, people will find a way around it.
7930151	7932732	I got one more thought and then I'm sure you want to say something on this too.
7932873	7942817	My other thought would be I think the best way to probably stop piracy or at least curb it, I don't think you will ever stop it, but to curb it, I think you make it cheap, you make it stupid.
7943397	7946699	I would point at iTunes as an example of that.
7946860	7949401	iTunes kind of showed up in the wake of Napster.
7949441	7950902	Napster got shut down, obviously.
7951363	7954745	iTunes kind of showed up as a legitimate way of doing something like Napster.
7955005	7960029	And the cool thing about iTunes, and I think one reason why it's been very successful, it's easy enough for my mother to use.
7960389	7962911	It's cheap, 99 cents a song, and stupid.
7963191	7964612	Click button, purchase song.
7965072	7968376	I think that's why digital distribution and things like Steam are starting to get more and more.
7968396	7978406	And I think Steam is going to pick up, pardon the pun, Steam, and you're going to see more, you know, these blowout sales, $9.99 for a game, click button, receive game.
7979449	7986274	Also, it gives you the illusion of having not really spent anything because you're not dealing with a tangible item.
7986674	7990597	You're not cashing out money using your card.
7991117	7993579	You're just clicking a button and there you go.
7993619	7997762	Your information is already there, which it does encourage people to spend more.
7997802	8000104	I'm guilty of the same, like Amazon's one click.
8000984	8001645	That gets me.
8002205	8004766	I buy books on Kindle and end up paying too much.
8004866	8006327	And look at the 360.
8007207	8009888	As Bobby lovingly refers to it, the Microsoft Space Bucks.
8010008	8012369	That's all just an elaborate illusion that you're spending real money.
8012830	8015991	Anyhow, Caller, I know you probably have something you want to say on this.
8016071	8017912	What are your thoughts on your own question?
8019079	8023941	I think they need to take away the DRM and make it, like you said, make it cheaper and encourage people to buy it.
8024421	8036444	I had a painful experience with Bioshock when I first bought it because you can install it like five times and you have to do an online activation and after five times you have to call in and if you want to
8037369	8037509	Dude,
8052409	8053049	Bingo.
8053189	8053710	I'm with you.
8053810	8057872	And that's almost like our last caller, the guy who's having problems with his video content.
8057912	8062835	He's being punished for his hardware breaking and him trying to support things and do things the legal way.
8063115	8071420	You expect anybody to support your – and that's why I said, dude, Spazinator, if it stops working, you need to just stop supporting Sony like that.
8071620	8074442	I mean he champions for Sony a lot on this show.
8074722	8076263	But if they're not going to return the favor to him –
8076823	8094175	they can go F themselves and we should bring it to light that if you use the Sony Video Marketplace to buy content it could possibly be a ticking time bomb hopefully it comes out next week that this was all just a big scare from a bonehead rep at Sony let's hope
8095777	8096057	Anyhow.
8096998	8098819	Well, I'm not going to take up more of your time.
8099199	8103422	I'm going to wish you a happy belated Valentine's Day and say goodbye.
8103562	8104963	You're still in time here in the U.S.
8105023	8106724	It's 8.30 and it's still Valentine's Day here.
8106784	8107864	So thank you very much for the call.
8107904	8108725	It's almost 6 a.m.
8108765	8108925	here.
8110046	8111286	Thank you for staying up late.
8111567	8112067	It means a lot.
8112087	8112467	No worries.
8112867	8113148	All right.
8113428	8113988	Have a good one, buddy.
8114769	8114969	Same.
8115189	8115329	Night.
8116243	8135673	I love first time callers and you know what I think that's the perfect way to end the Skype line tonight so I'm sorry to those guys that didn't get through tonight remember you still can send us tweets you can send us emails there are tons of other ways to interact with the show but I think let's let's end it on a first time caller tonight that was that was a good note to end on and a good topic very good topic kind of it's it's interesting how those two calls related tonight isn't it
8136525	8137826	Anyhow, last minute stories.
8137866	8139747	Loki, I know you've got to have some last minute stories over there.
8140548	8140708	Nope.
8141548	8141788	No?
8142489	8144930	No, I just wasn't paying attention.
8145691	8147672	Jerk.
8148513	8152275	I'm sure we've got something, but I just have to look it up.
8153956	8156217	DarkSakura, do you have any last minute stories for the night?
8156498	8156898	I don't know.
8157198	8158539	I'm almost done with this hat.
8160020	8161061	Just a quick programming note.
8161161	8168887	Next week, we are still planning on having a show next week, but I just want to warn folks, if things get delayed or something weird happens, it could happen.
8169167	8171389	This is live, really, not so much podcast.
8172129	8173651	I'm moving next week.
8173771	8179515	Now, I have movers that are supposed to be able to do it all in the morning, but just if weird stuff happens, yeah.
8179795	8185340	The podcast could also be delayed a little bit next week because I may not have internet at my new place right away.
8185900	8190303	but if worse comes to worse I'll just come over here to Casa de Jamie and take care of things over here.
8190343	8191364	I'm sure she won't mind.
8191844	8194046	We'll make hats together and upload podcasts.
8194086	8194546	It'll be fun.
8194707	8195627	I'll teach you how to crochet.
8196268	8196828	It might be fun.
8197769	8202132	Probably be more productive than a lot of the things I stay at home and do like World of Warcraft and stuff.
8202572	8204674	Alright Loki, got any last minute stories for us?
8204734	8206175	Yeah, we'll just cover a few things here.
8207175	8210798	Sam & Max, The Devil's Playground has been revealed by the OFLC.
8211939	8214560	Of course, that leaked out when it got raided.
8215221	8221065	And the episode 1 of that series will now be entitled The Penal Zone.
8221705	8226609	So that's scheduled to be coming out later on, probably this year.
8227890	8227990	Uh...
8229634	8231115	Let's see here.
8232456	8242102	Holy Invasion of Privacy Batman is unfortunately going to have to change its name after a conflict with an existing IP.
8242483	8244384	In other words, Batman.
8245905	8252149	So now it has been changed to What Did I Do to Deserve This, My Lord?
8252750	8255311	And of course, the sequel will be coming out very soon.
8255552	8257293	And we'll include the original as well.
8259415	8275412	Square Enix has trademarked Deuce X Human Revolution possibly meaning that they're going to be doing a new game in that series and it's been a while it's weird to hear that Square Enix is doing that but I have to remember they absorbed Eidos so this is a little weird for me but okay
8277389	8291221	and then of course those of you who bought Darksiders early enough received a card with a code on it and the instructions of do not discard this card and you'll want to save this code.
8291561	8304551	It has been revealed though that that code will entitle you to a free copy of Red Faction Guerrilla for PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 and the offer will be available until the end of March 7th
8305752	8311698	and apparently no word on exactly when you'll receive those copies.
8312499	8325971	You will have to pay $5 for shipping, however, but still though, Red Faction Guerrilla is a pretty awesome game and no word if they're still printing those cards and if they're included in copies of the game as of right now.
8328374	8329455	And that's about it.
8331306	8331787	All right.
8332267	8336170	Well, that's going to kind of start to wrap up another edition here.
8336190	8337372	Oh, I saw something else that's kind of funny.
8337452	8337772	Or not.
8337832	8338713	Real quick.
8338913	8340134	No, please, go ahead.
8340154	8344838	I didn't see a link to it or anything, but apparently someone's developed an emulator for the NES.
8345239	8352505	Right now it doesn't have any audio in it yet, but they programmed it all in the Blu-ray Java app.
8355128	8362118	So it will actually be able to run on PlayStation 3s without modification using just a flash drive.
8365701	8366321	Is this out yet?
8367142	8368002	Apparently it is.
8368082	8369663	I didn't see a link to where it was at though.
8370643	8375525	It doesn't run, like I said, with sound yet, but it does run most of the ROMs.
8375665	8378066	It's only a matter of time then before they get the sound and everything.
8378146	8381528	But that's pretty awesome that they're able to program that and no modification.
8382208	8385510	Hopefully it plays smoothly because the PlayStation controller is a sweet controller.
8385570	8387110	I would love to play NES games with that.
8388211	8390272	Ones that I own the cartridge for, legitimately, of course.
8390432	8390732	Of course.
8391632	8391973	That's it.
8392713	8393013	All right.
8393854	8397015	Well, that's going to do it for another edition here of Orange Lounge Radio.
8397115	8400577	But before we wrap things up, we've got to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
8400637	8402878	So, DarkSakura, do you have any final thoughts for us tonight?
8403599	8404139	I have one.
8405000	8405420	What's that?
8412984	8413364	Sigh.
8413964	8414865	Loki, your final thought.
8417395	8434973	I need to play more Borderlands my final thought is I'm getting hungry again I had a very lovely breakfast made for me this morning that was very filling but now you know that was a while ago so now I'm getting to the point where I'm like ooh tacos we'll see
8435538	8439782	Anyhow, thank you guys so much for downloading our show or listening to us live and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
