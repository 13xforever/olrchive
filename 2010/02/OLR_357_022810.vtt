00:00.000 --> 00:16.800
Tonight, February 28th, 2010.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.360
Which country has banned heavy rain?

00:18.360 --> 00:22.960
A date is announced for the Final Fantasy XIV beta, and a Nintendo Press event brings

00:22.960 --> 00:29.760
us a barrage of Wii and DS news.

00:29.760 --> 00:35.640
Hello, my friends, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, that talk show

00:35.640 --> 00:41.080
on the internet, live every Sunday night, dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming

00:41.080 --> 00:42.240
culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:42.240 --> 00:44.480
It is the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:44.480 --> 00:48.720
We do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern time

00:48.720 --> 00:54.480
at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf Show.

00:54.480 --> 00:58.160
A big thanks to them for letting us steal their bandwidth every single week.

00:58.160 --> 01:01.240
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you over the next few hours, I'll say hello to the one

01:01.240 --> 01:02.240
and only DarkSakura.

01:02.240 --> 01:03.240
Meh.

01:03.240 --> 01:04.240
How are you?

01:04.240 --> 01:05.240
Meh.

01:05.240 --> 01:06.240
Meh.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.240
Meh.

01:07.240 --> 01:10.880
I have one thing to say to the California government.

01:10.880 --> 01:11.880
Meh.

01:11.880 --> 01:12.880
Fuck.

01:12.880 --> 01:14.800
I'll get into that in a little bit during housekeeping, absolutely.

01:14.800 --> 01:18.760
If you wonder what she's talking about, and it's not just an unbalanced budget, but there's

01:18.760 --> 01:20.640
other stuff going on, you've probably heard.

01:20.640 --> 01:24.160
I think it's made those water cooler press stories this week.

01:24.160 --> 01:27.600
And boy do we have the response for you, we're gonna get into that in a little bit.

01:27.600 --> 01:30.560
Uh, we do talk games too, right, Techmaster Loki?

01:30.560 --> 01:31.560
Also here joining us every week?

01:31.560 --> 01:32.560
Um, yeah, every now and then.

01:32.560 --> 01:33.560
How you doing, Loki?

01:33.560 --> 01:34.560
I'm doing okay.

01:34.560 --> 01:37.040
I like that, every now and then we do decide to get around to games.

01:37.040 --> 01:39.280
So today was the end of the Olympics, right?

01:39.280 --> 01:40.800
Um, apparently it is.

01:40.800 --> 01:41.800
Are they done?

01:41.800 --> 01:42.800
The closing ceremony?

01:42.800 --> 01:43.800
I guess they're done.

01:43.800 --> 01:47.360
Okay, good, we won't have to compete against them anymore, cause our listener numbers have

01:47.360 --> 01:49.520
been down, cause people gotta watch their curling.

01:49.520 --> 01:52.480
Yay, the office is gonna be back on, that makes me happy.

01:52.480 --> 01:56.840
Alright, all the shows, are you excited about the Tonight Show with Jay Leno?

01:56.840 --> 01:58.800
Oh, I'm not watching that.

01:58.800 --> 01:59.800
Yeah, nobody is.

01:59.800 --> 02:00.800
Alright, uh.

02:00.800 --> 02:03.640
Yeah, I'm boycotting him.

02:03.640 --> 02:06.040
Nobody with any taste is.

02:06.040 --> 02:07.800
My grandma's happy, I'll tell you that.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.800
Alright, let's get into our gaming weeks.

02:09.800 --> 02:13.240
Yes, once in a while we do talk about video games here, and we let the gamers have a voice

02:13.240 --> 02:16.840
in our chat room, chat.orangelauntrady.com, but don't worry, if you're not listening live,

02:16.840 --> 02:20.420
if you're listening on the podcast feed, there are a million billion ways to communicate

02:20.420 --> 02:21.420
with the show.

02:21.420 --> 02:24.000
If there's a social network for it, we're probably on it somewhere.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
Uh, the Twitters, the Facebooks, we take emails every week.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
All of it.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.980
And phone calls a little later on too, so uh, yeah, we'll look forward to chatting with

02:31.980 --> 02:32.980
you guys.

02:32.980 --> 02:34.540
Uh, let's get into our gaming weeks though.

02:34.540 --> 02:36.000
Let's actually bring it to games, video games.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.120
What have you been playing this week, Dark Sakura?

02:38.120 --> 02:42.120
Um, not really much of anything, I really haven't had any time.

02:42.120 --> 02:44.860
I've been, had a very, very busy week.

02:44.860 --> 02:48.560
I've played a little, actually no I didn't, I actually played any Star Trek Online this

02:48.560 --> 02:49.560
week, I don't think.

02:49.560 --> 02:50.560
So.

02:50.560 --> 02:51.560
Wow, are you okay?

02:51.560 --> 02:52.560
Are you feeling okay?

02:52.560 --> 02:53.560
Real life.

02:53.560 --> 02:54.720
Well, that happens.

02:54.720 --> 03:00.040
I've had lots of homework to do and lots of, you know, responsibilities to take care of,

03:00.040 --> 03:01.040
so I haven't really played anything.

03:01.040 --> 03:02.760
Well, you gotta take a break once in a while.

03:02.760 --> 03:08.080
Although I've tried to play my Sims 3 and it probably hates my mod, so I have to reinstall

03:08.080 --> 03:09.080
it, so whatever.

03:09.080 --> 03:12.160
Well, Loki, how about you, have you been playing anything this week?

03:12.160 --> 03:19.680
Um, just a lot of Borderlands, um, I've been trying to go through and finish Mad Moxie's

03:19.680 --> 03:24.320
Underdome and unfortunately didn't get a chance to do that because the ones I'm on now are

03:24.320 --> 03:33.760
the 20 round matches, which, each round has 5 waves in it and it takes forever, so, unfortunately

03:33.760 --> 03:37.040
I made it only through 7 rounds before I realized I'm not gonna be able to finish it in the

03:37.040 --> 03:41.600
time that I had, so I quit that and played a little bit more just the standard campaign

03:41.600 --> 03:48.580
now, but I'm almost maxed out as far as, um, you know, my level goes.

03:48.580 --> 03:53.320
But I am kind of trying to collect some weapons and stuff because, you know, I downloaded

03:53.320 --> 04:00.480
the new expansion, um, and unfortunately the new expansion kills any mods that you have,

04:00.480 --> 04:06.760
so can't use my modded weapons as cool as they are, so I just have to find something,

04:06.760 --> 04:11.000
you know, newer ones to use, but, I mean you can still mod weapons, you just can't go crazy

04:11.000 --> 04:16.440
with them now, you can't put like shotgun parts on a pistol or, you know, rocket launch

04:16.440 --> 04:21.960
parts on a machine gun or whatever, you just have to keep it within the rules of the game,

04:21.960 --> 04:25.360
so I don't know, it'll be fun.

04:25.360 --> 04:31.040
Um, and then of course, more Grand Theft Auto and, uh, doing well on that, still trying

04:31.040 --> 04:40.780
to move up the leaderboards and, uh, I broke 200 now for cumulative, uh, ranked death matches

04:40.780 --> 04:53.280
and I'm, I think, almost like in the 60's for, uh, true skill rankings, so, it's going

04:53.280 --> 04:55.440
pretty well, I'll be up there pretty soon.

04:55.440 --> 04:59.720
The only problem is though, is those guys that are actually in the top of the true skill

04:59.720 --> 05:07.000
ranks, they tend not to want to play games, um, that they're losing, apparently they drop

05:07.000 --> 05:10.640
out and so it doesn't, their rank doesn't go down.

05:10.640 --> 05:15.140
So I actually did run into some people, I actually ran into the number one player and

05:15.140 --> 05:19.760
like the number six player and both of them did not want to play me, which is too bad

05:19.760 --> 05:22.320
because I would have kicked the crap out of them.

05:22.320 --> 05:24.760
That's it, that's why I'm playing this week.

05:24.760 --> 05:27.960
And you still have a cold, you were sick last week and you're still sick.

05:27.960 --> 05:28.960
Yeah.

05:28.960 --> 05:29.960
Are you feeling okay?

05:29.960 --> 05:30.960
Um.

05:30.960 --> 05:31.960
Do you need some medication?

05:31.960 --> 05:38.080
No, I'm fine, I took two days off this week and that's where I play a lot Borderlands,

05:38.080 --> 05:44.840
and did other things, but uh, you can't really go into that because a wife would not be happy.

05:44.840 --> 05:51.020
Alright then, fine, uh, okay, my gaming week, actually I had a week similar to Jamie's where

05:51.020 --> 05:52.960
a lot of real life stuff is coming into play.

05:52.960 --> 05:58.800
I'm still working on the whole moving thing, which will be done like tomorrow, so thankfully.

05:58.800 --> 06:02.840
But I did play a little bit, I did get into World of Warcraft of course, my boyfriend

06:02.840 --> 06:06.320
and I have been leveling together, I helped him kind of get started with the character,

06:06.320 --> 06:09.600
actually no, I take that back, he started the character and by the time it got to about

06:09.600 --> 06:14.040
level 21, I don't remember, 23, somewhere in there, we started leveling together and

06:14.040 --> 06:17.680
now we just hit 50 this weekend, so yay to leveling.

06:17.680 --> 06:21.000
It's kind of fun to have somebody to always play WoW with, it's cool.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.400
You know, I'm really trying to get as much Borderlands in this week, because I have a

06:24.400 --> 06:28.080
feeling I'm going to have Final Fantasy 13 by the end of this week, and oh my god, everything's

06:28.080 --> 06:29.080
going to stop.

06:29.080 --> 06:32.700
Wait, wait, wait, is your connections getting that early, because I want to place an order

06:32.700 --> 06:36.080
if so.

06:36.080 --> 06:41.400
I don't know if we have extras, but I will check, that's for sure.

06:41.400 --> 06:44.120
You can count on me coming over on Saturday if that's the case, oh no, I'm going to be

06:44.120 --> 06:47.120
out of town this weekend, oh well, Monday, Monday for sure.

06:47.120 --> 06:50.800
Alright, well anyway, all that stuff aside, yeah, I'm very excited about Final Fantasy

06:50.800 --> 06:54.280
13, I was very busy with movies, I didn't play a lot, but I did have one night earlier

06:54.280 --> 06:59.360
this week, I just decided to have a retro 360 arcade night for the heck of it, because

06:59.360 --> 07:04.520
I was joking on last week's show that, you know, we had this story where it came up at

07:04.520 --> 07:08.800
some point during the show that the former Midway games had all disappeared from Xbox

07:08.800 --> 07:12.920
Live, Joust and Smash TV, so I had a night where I just decided to play a bunch of retro

07:12.920 --> 07:15.600
games, I went in, I played Joust, I went in, I played, I don't think I actually played

07:15.600 --> 07:20.480
Smash TV, I started playing Jyris for a while, for some weird reason, like, well, it's not

07:20.480 --> 07:23.040
a weird reason, I just really love that game, it's one of my favorite shooters from the

07:23.040 --> 07:24.040
80s.

07:24.040 --> 07:27.960
I actually beat my former high score, which isn't very good, I need to work on it.

07:27.960 --> 07:31.920
You know, Jyris, and a lot of the old arcade games admittedly, is all about memorization,

07:31.920 --> 07:35.580
like knowing where the ships come from in every wave, so I just really need to kind

07:35.580 --> 07:38.480
of work on it for a little while, but I got a better score, so that made me happy.

07:38.480 --> 07:42.440
I think I beat my score on another old game too, and I can't remember which one it was,

07:42.440 --> 07:45.720
I don't remember if it was Time Pilot or, no, I think it was like Tempest, again though,

07:45.720 --> 07:47.840
my score is still not very good, I need to work on it.

07:47.840 --> 07:54.240
Yeah, as I mentioned, you know, one of the things I did while I was sick is worked on

07:54.240 --> 07:58.780
something that my wife would not like, and that is I'm building up parts of Arcade Cabinet

07:58.780 --> 08:04.640
for work, so that's actually coming along pretty well, it looks pretty nice.

08:04.640 --> 08:09.620
But I'm excited because today, actually, they released the new version of Hyperspin, which

08:09.620 --> 08:15.740
is the frontend I use for my cabinet, and the thing I like about the new one the best

08:15.740 --> 08:23.000
is they have a way to add games to your favorites list, really simple, and that's going to make

08:23.000 --> 08:29.500
cutting down the list of 5,000 games to what I'm actually going to play a whole lot faster

08:29.500 --> 08:34.760
than I was doing it before, so I'm actually going to be downloading that probably when

08:34.760 --> 08:39.880
I get home, and I'm going to go through my cabinet and get it all ready to go, but actually

08:39.880 --> 08:46.880
I put a second brand new graphics card into it so that I could play BlazBlue Continuum

08:46.880 --> 08:54.480
Shift at full speed, and I can now, and it's awesome, but for some reason, an IOMI version

08:54.480 --> 09:00.000
of Marvel is Capcom 2 still has slowdowns in it, but it's not by my computer because

09:00.000 --> 09:02.680
it's certainly fast enough, so.

09:02.680 --> 09:06.040
Let me ask kind of like a random MAME question, because I'm going to be honest, I haven't

09:06.040 --> 09:11.160
played MAME, the Arcade Emulator, in quite a long time.

09:11.160 --> 09:15.400
Did it ever get to the point where, like, it does more things online, like the exchange

09:15.400 --> 09:18.740
of high scores or like an online leaderboard or something?

09:18.740 --> 09:22.960
Because I really see that as being some of the big appeal of Game Room to me, the legitimate

09:22.960 --> 09:26.400
MAME or whatever you want to call it, I think it's really cool that I'm going to have leaderboards

09:26.400 --> 09:30.360
with friends and, you know, some of that medals and achievements element.

09:30.360 --> 09:33.800
MAME is just flat out emulating the old games, right?

09:33.800 --> 09:35.200
They didn't add any frills to it?

09:35.200 --> 09:39.040
They didn't really add any frills to it, you can get ones that'll do different things,

09:39.040 --> 09:44.720
but it's mainly they're just looking for the actual arcade emulation that, you know, using

09:44.720 --> 09:52.960
just your processor and, you know, no, you know, using your graphics card for anything.

09:52.960 --> 09:57.760
As far as playing stuff online with each other, they don't really have that.

09:57.760 --> 10:01.760
And I can understand, you know, the high scores and stuff, that'd be kind of tough.

10:01.760 --> 10:08.040
I mean, they do have patches now that will save your high scores, but nothing that you

10:08.040 --> 10:09.360
can play online with each other.

10:09.360 --> 10:17.320
They may have, like, you know, there's other programs out there like MESS or Misfit MAME,

10:17.320 --> 10:21.280
which will run all sorts of hacked games.

10:21.280 --> 10:27.440
Maybe those will have, you know, some sort of online play or something, but MAME does not.

10:27.440 --> 10:30.640
Honestly, it does make sense, though, that there's not a lot of frills, because MAME is

10:30.640 --> 10:33.680
sort of in that really gray area of legality as it is.

10:33.680 --> 10:37.520
I mean, there's nothing wrong with the MAME program itself, but it's the fact that, you

10:37.520 --> 10:42.960
know, the ROMs are not legal, except for a handful, you know, there have been a few that

10:42.960 --> 10:47.560
the original creators of the game have come back and said, yeah, that was like 25 years

10:47.560 --> 10:52.120
ago and we're not going to make any money off of it, so we hereby release it in the

10:52.120 --> 10:53.120
public domain.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.120
Woohoo, have fun.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.680
There have been a handful of those games.

10:55.680 --> 11:00.280
So I think if MAME were to come in and say, oh, we're going to implement this online leaderboard

11:00.280 --> 11:04.320
for this game, it would really kind of start to push the boundaries of the gray area of

11:04.320 --> 11:05.320
legality that it's in.

11:05.320 --> 11:08.880
It'd be tough to do it, and it'd be tough to make sure people aren't cheating in it,

11:08.880 --> 11:09.880
and just...

11:09.880 --> 11:10.880
True.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.440
It'd just be too difficult.

11:12.440 --> 11:22.160
But I do believe, actually, that I think Macaron or maybe Demul, one of the Dreamcast emulators,

11:22.160 --> 11:23.680
is actually doing online.

11:23.680 --> 11:26.040
You can play multiplayer over, like, the internet.

11:26.040 --> 11:27.040
No, that's cool.

11:27.040 --> 11:31.840
And I know those do Niomi games, so like Marvel vs. Capcom 2 or...

11:31.840 --> 11:35.520
Did they ever perfect it on the NES or Super Nintendo, because I remember some of those

11:35.520 --> 11:40.520
old, old emulators, like, I want to say, like, Nesticle, even, if you remember that one,

11:40.520 --> 11:45.040
and Zessness had internet play, but it was kind of wonky.

11:45.040 --> 11:47.120
Did they ever perfect that?

11:47.120 --> 11:48.120
I think those have gotten better.

11:48.120 --> 11:49.120
I don't know.

11:49.120 --> 11:50.120
I don't play over the internet with that stuff.

11:50.120 --> 11:51.120
The same with MAME.

11:51.120 --> 11:57.800
I mean, it's my, my cabinet, unfortunately, the motherboard in it's really cheap, and

11:57.800 --> 12:01.320
so anytime I overclock it, the ethernet stops working, so...

12:01.320 --> 12:07.880
Well, I've always said I would love Nintendo's Virtual Console if it was on Xbox Live.

12:07.880 --> 12:10.680
That's what I've always said about Virtual Console.

12:10.680 --> 12:14.400
We're going to get into this more later, but I'm honestly surprised at the release schedule

12:14.400 --> 12:19.200
that they have right now, so maybe they are coming around, I mean, because that's basically

12:19.200 --> 12:25.800
all the games that they announced at E3 coming out before E3 this year, so it's like, okay,

12:25.800 --> 12:28.480
clean slate, what are you going to announce for the rest of the year, you know?

12:28.480 --> 12:30.320
Yeah, we'll get into that a little bit, though.

12:30.320 --> 12:32.720
Before we get into the gaming news, let me do some housekeeping tonight.

12:32.720 --> 12:36.160
We don't have a whole lot of housekeeping here in house, but something Dark Soccer referenced

12:36.160 --> 12:38.960
a little earlier in the show, I just kind of wanted to share this and throw this out

12:38.960 --> 12:45.000
there with you guys, apparently the California State Assembly passed a measure this week

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
that is going to support anti-swearing week, or what do they call it, no cussing week,

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
right?

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
The first week of March.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Yeah, something like that.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.480
So starting Monday, because today's the last day of February, believe it or not, so starting

12:54.480 --> 12:57.340
Monday, it is no cuss week in California.

12:57.340 --> 13:02.360
So if you so much as say fuck out loud, you're going to get hauled off to jail.

13:02.360 --> 13:04.160
No, okay, it's not really like that.

13:04.160 --> 13:13.400
What it is, I don't know, some kid in a club in California started this no cussing club,

13:13.400 --> 13:18.000
and it caught on amongst all these people that think if you cuss, then clearly you're

13:18.000 --> 13:22.440
not intelligent because only unintelligent people have to fill their vocabulary with

13:22.440 --> 13:25.360
cuss words, blah, blah, blah, I don't know, something along those lines.

13:25.360 --> 13:28.160
So somehow this got all the way to the State Assembly.

13:28.160 --> 13:32.600
While we are in the midst of a budget crisis, yet again, mind you, and we can't even go

13:32.600 --> 13:36.400
to the DMV anymore because we're not even sure when they're actually open, because they're

13:36.400 --> 13:37.400
closed half the time.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.880
Anyway, sorry, I don't want to get on the political tangent here too much.

13:40.880 --> 13:45.200
So they found time to pass this resolution to support the no cussing week, and they're

13:45.200 --> 13:51.780
encouraging that everybody should keep a swear jar, and if you say fuck or damn or whatever,

13:51.780 --> 13:54.720
you should put in 25 cents into the swear jar.

13:54.720 --> 14:03.320
So yeah, and you should donate this to charity, to Haiti or probably Chile now, and obviously

14:03.320 --> 14:08.520
our thoughts to everybody who was affected by that recent thing, and I don't have a problem

14:08.520 --> 14:14.500
with donating to charity, but I think I have a little bit of a problem with the government

14:14.500 --> 14:17.760
endorsing something that sort of infringes on freedom of speech.

14:17.760 --> 14:23.520
I mean, call me crazy, and if you look at this dude's website for the no cussing club,

14:23.520 --> 14:29.120
they're selling books, they're selling charters on how to start your own club, gee, the guy's

14:29.120 --> 14:31.080
profiting off this idea.

14:31.080 --> 14:33.960
Are they taxing him?

14:33.960 --> 14:34.960
I hope so.

14:34.960 --> 14:39.520
Well, you know what, you can't knock him for profiting off of it because if people are

14:39.520 --> 14:43.680
dumb enough to pay him for it, then whatever.

14:43.680 --> 14:50.480
I mean, that's what capitalism is built on, profiting off the stupid, so why not?

14:50.480 --> 14:53.840
I'm sorry, again, I don't mean to get on the political train, but this does affect video

14:53.840 --> 14:57.840
games because this is the home of Silicon Valley and where a lot of the games are made,

14:57.840 --> 15:02.080
so you know, if the state goes belly up, so are a lot of your favorite game publishers.

15:02.080 --> 15:03.080
Well they're already written.

15:03.080 --> 15:07.680
I'm sorry, but this non-cussing week is about as, okay, now I don't even want to compare

15:07.680 --> 15:15.200
it to that because this, you know, god damn it if I make fun of Talk Like a Pirate Day,

15:15.200 --> 15:20.840
but I mean, as far as non-cussing week goes, it is about, you know, as, as, uh...

15:20.840 --> 15:24.960
Well, but Talk Like a Pirate Day has not been endorsed by the state of California.

15:24.960 --> 15:28.480
Talk Like a Pirate Day is an internet meme-y, basically, that's gone crazy.

15:28.480 --> 15:29.480
Yeah, exactly.

15:29.480 --> 15:30.800
Is it a 4chan thing?

15:30.800 --> 15:32.080
It might as well be.

15:32.080 --> 15:33.080
You know, it's one of those things.

15:33.080 --> 15:38.560
But, I mean, it's basically about, you know, that important as far as, I mean, and I would

15:38.560 --> 15:43.240
say even less important than Talk Like a Pirate Day because that's actually kind of cool,

15:43.240 --> 15:49.160
but um, you know, it's about that important, like, you know, no one's gonna care.

15:49.160 --> 15:50.720
I mean, they're not doing anything.

15:50.720 --> 15:53.760
They're not punishing you for not cussing.

15:53.760 --> 15:57.200
Most people don't even know that this is even happening.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.200
Who cares?

15:58.200 --> 16:01.360
Uh, comment from our chat room, Tigerclaw, and chat says, you know, this sucks for those

16:01.360 --> 16:03.220
who do podcasts that live in California.

16:03.220 --> 16:05.880
They won't be able to cuss on their show either, lol.

16:05.880 --> 16:06.880
Hold on.

16:06.880 --> 16:07.880
Hold on.

16:07.880 --> 16:10.760
This is just an assembly thing that supports no cussing week.

16:10.760 --> 16:14.440
Nobody can stop me from saying fuck, that's my first amendment right.

16:14.440 --> 16:19.240
I can say fuck and I can say cunt and whole lots of worse words I can think of.

16:19.240 --> 16:23.520
I can say them and nobody can take that right away because I live in America, which is great.

16:23.520 --> 16:28.680
But I'm glad you brought that up because next week's show will fall during no cussing week.

16:28.680 --> 16:32.760
So I do want to point out, we here at OLR, we do have our plan and we are going to bring

16:32.760 --> 16:36.720
you, OLR presents our no cussing week show next week.

16:36.720 --> 16:38.580
So we're looking very much forward to that.

16:38.580 --> 16:39.920
So stay tuned.

16:39.920 --> 16:43.120
So OLR celebrates no cussing week in the state of California next week.

16:43.120 --> 16:44.120
It'll be fun.

16:44.120 --> 16:48.600
But why are we giving them more fuel for, you know, their fire, you know what I mean?

16:48.600 --> 16:51.600
It'll be fun.

16:51.600 --> 16:54.920
We like to challenge ourselves here at Orange Lounge Radio.

16:54.920 --> 16:59.020
Let's challenge ourselves with some video game news tonight, Loki.

16:59.020 --> 17:01.120
I don't want to fucking do it.

17:01.120 --> 17:06.720
Sorry, I have to get that out of there.

17:06.720 --> 17:10.520
So this is kind of interesting.

17:10.520 --> 17:19.520
Apparently the PS3 developers have now 70 megabytes of additional RAM unlocked to be

17:19.520 --> 17:21.560
able to use in their games.

17:21.560 --> 17:27.680
Sony apparently has been upgrading the PS3 over the past few months and doing so they've

17:27.680 --> 17:36.540
dropped the OS's memory footprint from 120 megabytes to 50 megabytes and basically allowing

17:36.540 --> 17:44.600
the system to use less RAM and therefore being able to pass on the RAM to other developers.

17:44.600 --> 17:48.100
Now, is that going to really make a difference?

17:48.100 --> 17:49.100
Probably not.

17:49.100 --> 17:55.080
I mean, it'll help, you know, they want to optimize their code as much.

17:55.080 --> 18:00.480
But you know, as PS3 developers have basically said, any bit of RAM helps.

18:00.480 --> 18:01.480
So neat.

18:01.480 --> 18:09.420
Yeah, I guess a little bit of RAM is better than none, but well, I mean, sorry, obviously

18:09.420 --> 18:12.120
there is RAM in the system as it is, but you know what I mean?

18:12.120 --> 18:13.720
The more RAM, the merrier.

18:13.720 --> 18:19.240
But how is it that this console's been out for so long and now they're saying, hey, we've

18:19.240 --> 18:21.240
unlocked this hidden RAM?

18:21.240 --> 18:22.240
Is it just because they've optimized?

18:22.240 --> 18:27.800
Yeah, they've just optimized their operating system.

18:27.800 --> 18:32.360
They basically found new ways to do it for things and now, because it's optimized, they

18:32.360 --> 18:35.320
don't need as much RAM.

18:35.320 --> 18:38.620
But yeah, I wouldn't expect that suddenly all these games are going to have uber better

18:38.620 --> 18:40.160
graphics and all this stuff.

18:40.160 --> 18:43.120
I mean, 70 megs of RAM is not that much and all said and done.

18:43.120 --> 18:46.440
So what, that's going to be like an extra, maybe an extra splish splash in the water

18:46.440 --> 18:49.480
effect or an extra little dangling light somewhere in Silent Hill.

18:49.480 --> 18:56.000
Anything I'm surprised they're not using it for like, you know, more, you know, features

18:56.000 --> 19:01.600
in the operating system, you know, custom soundtracks in all the games, you know, cross

19:01.600 --> 19:08.440
game chat, which I think is still there now, hopefully, you know, video chat or something

19:08.440 --> 19:09.440
like that.

19:09.440 --> 19:10.440
I don't know.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.880
They could be using that RAM for something.

19:12.880 --> 19:18.800
Or I don't know, let's see, these consoles, you know, have been out for a while and put

19:18.800 --> 19:24.960
more RAM in them, you know, like gigs of RAM instead of like half a gig or whatever the

19:24.960 --> 19:25.960
hell's in these.

19:25.960 --> 19:29.360
I know it's not more than a gig.

19:29.360 --> 19:30.360
It's poetic.

19:30.360 --> 19:36.960
But they can't up it after the console's already out because then the games that are released

19:36.960 --> 19:39.040
may not work on the older system.

19:39.040 --> 19:40.720
So it's just like you have a new console out there.

19:40.720 --> 19:43.720
Like remember, like I'm thinking of the Nintendo 64 memory pack.

19:43.720 --> 19:47.320
Like, didn't you have to have that little memory pack in order to play like Majora's

19:47.320 --> 19:48.320
Mask?

19:48.320 --> 19:49.320
Is that a nice game with that?

19:49.320 --> 19:50.680
Some games, yes.

19:50.680 --> 19:55.760
But here's the thing is, like the PSP, they doubled the RAM that they have for their,

19:55.760 --> 20:01.840
well, it's mainly for their web browser, but it can be done.

20:01.840 --> 20:06.760
I mean, all it would do is those games would run smoother.

20:06.760 --> 20:07.760
I see.

20:07.760 --> 20:10.600
But games would still have to be optimized for the lowest common denominator, really.

20:10.600 --> 20:11.600
Yes.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.040
Or else they're going to find themselves in trouble.

20:13.040 --> 20:18.280
But eventually they would phase that out, you know, phase out the old systems and all

20:18.280 --> 20:21.400
right, well, one system that doesn't seem to be getting any upgrades in its near future

20:21.400 --> 20:25.640
is the Nintendo Wii, but that doesn't stop Nintendo from trying to crank out the big,

20:25.640 --> 20:26.640
big games.

20:26.640 --> 20:27.840
And they had a big press event this week.

20:27.840 --> 20:31.320
We're going to focus on the next few stories talking about for a moment.

20:31.320 --> 20:34.180
And of course, some big, big titles coming out of this press event that happened this

20:34.180 --> 20:35.180
week.

20:35.180 --> 20:42.680
Two of them being Mario Galaxy 2 and Metroid Other M. Sounds like Super Mario Galaxy 2

20:42.680 --> 20:46.600
and Metroid Other M are both going to be out mid-year, which was a little bit of a surprise

20:46.600 --> 20:50.760
because I think a lot of us were thinking, even though Other M was shown at last E3,

20:50.760 --> 20:53.920
we were kind of thinking, oh, it's early, it's going to be out this holiday season.

20:53.920 --> 20:57.200
But no, both these games have now been dated for mid-year.

20:57.200 --> 21:02.420
So Mario Galaxy 2, I believe they've said, they've even said like, what, May, I think,

21:02.420 --> 21:04.400
and Metroid Other M is going to be out in June.

21:04.400 --> 21:05.400
Yes.

21:05.400 --> 21:08.400
So June 27th, which is the day after my birthday, I believe.

21:08.400 --> 21:13.160
So, you know, it's kind of exciting these games are coming out so soon, but what's that

21:13.160 --> 21:14.760
mean for the rest of the year?

21:14.760 --> 21:16.800
What big titles does Nintendo have left?

21:16.800 --> 21:18.920
They've already hinted that they're going to announce a new Zelda game that's going

21:18.920 --> 21:19.920
to come out at the end of the year.

21:19.920 --> 21:21.560
I mean, that's basically what's going to happen.

21:21.560 --> 21:26.000
You're going to have a new Zelda game, probably running in the Twilight Princess engine.

21:26.000 --> 21:31.120
And that'll be the new game this year, and everyone will go buck-a-wild over it.

21:31.120 --> 21:34.960
So I guess some of the early impressions are out over these games, and Super Mario Galaxy

21:34.960 --> 21:40.660
2 is pretty much Super Mario Galaxy 1, but some new worlds and new features and things.

21:40.660 --> 21:42.040
Not a lot of differences, though.

21:42.040 --> 21:43.320
It's not like the game has suddenly changed.

21:43.320 --> 21:45.080
I don't think it has to be, I mean, really.

21:45.080 --> 21:47.400
As long as it has B. Mario, who's going to care?

21:47.400 --> 21:54.440
Really it was, you know, it was a good game, so you know, don't really need to change it.

21:54.440 --> 21:57.480
Metroid Other M, on the other hand, finally we're getting some more details out of that,

21:57.480 --> 22:00.960
and it does sound like it's going to be a direct sequel to Super Metroid, which you

22:00.960 --> 22:05.540
know has me excited, because I think Super Metroid's the greatest game they ever made.

22:05.540 --> 22:09.920
So hearing that this is a direct sequel, well, I do also approach that with caution, because

22:09.920 --> 22:12.800
there's a part of me that goes, they could really screw this up.

22:12.800 --> 22:18.540
But apparently they have a whole rendered scene of what happens at the end of Super

22:18.540 --> 22:24.880
Metroid, is how the beginning of Other M starts, and it's all like rendered in the new 2 to

22:24.880 --> 22:25.880
3D type thing.

22:25.880 --> 22:28.840
I guess what happens in the game is that you play a lot of it in 2D, but you can actually

22:28.840 --> 22:32.160
switch to 3D on a button press, which sounds kind of neat.

22:32.160 --> 22:33.460
Is that the first person?

22:33.460 --> 22:37.720
It's like Paper Mario or something, which is interesting.

22:37.720 --> 22:41.760
So I'm certainly excited about Metroid Other M.

22:41.760 --> 22:46.000
If it is mostly a 2D Metroid especially, I'm really excited.

22:46.000 --> 22:50.680
I mean, I'm cool with them throwing some 3D in there a la Paper Mario, and you know, it's

22:50.680 --> 22:55.520
not that Prime was bad, but it's just I love Super Metroid and can't wait to see a game

22:55.520 --> 22:56.520
like that.

22:56.520 --> 22:59.680
So I'm sure we'll see more details on this in the coming months, because this game is

22:59.680 --> 23:00.680
going to be out now.

23:00.680 --> 23:01.920
What, we're looking at March?

23:01.920 --> 23:03.920
This game's out in three months?

23:03.920 --> 23:04.920
Yeah.

23:04.920 --> 23:05.920
Crazy.

23:05.920 --> 23:06.920
So.

23:06.920 --> 23:10.320
And actually we're getting linked to something on YouTube.

23:10.320 --> 23:13.960
I'm hoping this isn't a joke, but it comes from Tiger Claw saying the Metroid Other M

23:13.960 --> 23:16.640
intro video was apparently leaked.

23:16.640 --> 23:21.040
Oh yeah, somebody's got their little camera here at the press conference.

23:21.040 --> 23:24.400
So Tiger Claw just linked this in our chat room.

23:24.400 --> 23:28.880
I'm trying to see, and I apologize because I know video doesn't make for great radio,

23:28.880 --> 23:32.240
but okay, we see nebulas and clouds and all that stuff here.

23:32.240 --> 23:36.120
Let me skip forward a little more in the video.

23:36.120 --> 23:40.600
Now whoever's holding their camera's having to hold it a little low, but we do see kind

23:40.600 --> 23:43.080
of like a rendered Samus in 3D action.

23:43.080 --> 23:46.560
Those graphics look really good, especially for the Wii.

23:46.560 --> 23:49.520
I know Nintendo's hoping this will be the game that changes people's minds.

23:49.520 --> 23:52.440
Oh, there's the baby Metroid from the end of Super Metroid.

23:52.440 --> 23:53.520
Isn't it cute?

23:53.520 --> 23:54.520
And the mother brain.

23:54.520 --> 23:57.680
Oh wow, that, that actually does look pretty impressive.

23:57.680 --> 24:02.200
Oh, remember how the boss shot the laser from her eye and everything?

24:02.200 --> 24:05.200
Interesting.

24:05.200 --> 24:06.200
That's pretty cool.

24:06.200 --> 24:10.800
Oh, whoever leaked that little piece of footage is going to get busted, but that's really

24:10.800 --> 24:11.800
awesome.

24:11.800 --> 24:12.800
That's cool.

24:12.800 --> 24:17.760
If you want to check that out, the YouTube user that has this video posted right now

24:17.760 --> 24:20.440
is MetroidBlaster127.

24:20.440 --> 24:23.800
That's where we're, where we got linked to by our chat room.

24:23.800 --> 24:28.320
I got to say, maybe this will be the game that changes people's minds on the Wii.

24:28.320 --> 24:30.320
I don't know.

24:30.320 --> 24:35.560
Well, or it's not necessarily my mind needs to be changed because Nintendo does put out

24:35.560 --> 24:38.240
like that one or two awesome games a year.

24:38.240 --> 24:44.000
If this does well, let's say a Team Ninja Zelda game or a Team Ninja Mario game.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.440
Or just a third party with a sacred Nintendo franchise.

24:46.440 --> 24:48.400
Or a Team Ninja Smash Brothers game.

24:48.400 --> 24:49.400
Ah, hot.

24:49.400 --> 24:51.280
That'd be very hot.

24:51.280 --> 24:52.280
So we'll see.

24:52.280 --> 24:55.240
That'll be out in June.

24:55.240 --> 24:58.760
Unfortunately it's not going to be HD because the Wii doesn't support it, but...

24:58.760 --> 24:59.760
Who cares?

24:59.760 --> 25:00.760
It's good.

25:00.760 --> 25:03.480
Yeah, it's, I got to say for 480p it still looks really good.

25:03.480 --> 25:05.520
So we'll see.

25:05.520 --> 25:06.520
We will see.

25:06.520 --> 25:08.240
Well, let's move on with some more gaming news.

25:08.240 --> 25:09.520
Dark Sakura.

25:09.520 --> 25:13.200
Well, this is about the DSi XL.

25:13.200 --> 25:14.920
We've got a date and a price for it.

25:14.920 --> 25:20.720
It looks like it's going to be out on March 28th, going to be $190 and I'm pretty sure

25:20.720 --> 25:23.760
I don't know if I'm going to get one.

25:23.760 --> 25:27.640
Aren't they saying that a new DS is kind of rumored for E3 this year?

25:27.640 --> 25:30.000
Like that could be one of the things that they announce?

25:30.000 --> 25:36.080
Yeah, it's supposed to be one for $189.99.

25:36.080 --> 25:39.720
I'm going to laugh if they do release a new one right after they do this.

25:39.720 --> 25:42.120
Well, I know we've gotten into this on the show before.

25:42.120 --> 25:44.200
They did the micro after the DS was announced.

25:44.200 --> 25:45.200
I liked my micro.

25:45.200 --> 25:47.600
I honestly don't think that they need to do another DS.

25:47.600 --> 25:54.120
I mean, granted the XL, whatever, they, people might want a larger screen for something.

25:54.120 --> 25:59.480
I don't know, they're kind of posing this as like a secondhand ebook reader or something

25:59.480 --> 26:00.480
like that.

26:00.480 --> 26:03.800
In fact, I think one of the new pieces of software they're going to have with this is

26:03.800 --> 26:06.600
like some sort of classic novel collection or something like that.

26:06.600 --> 26:07.880
That could be interesting.

26:07.880 --> 26:08.880
I would get that.

26:08.880 --> 26:10.420
And then again, I use my Kindle.

26:10.420 --> 26:11.700
It wasn't this game.

26:11.700 --> 26:17.720
There was actually a, or it wasn't the DSi XL that was necessarily kind of cool.

26:17.720 --> 26:24.280
There was a, I want to say it's a new DSiWare game that's going to be coming out where it's

26:24.280 --> 26:29.240
like a hidden pictures game that you have to search for different letters in this like

26:29.240 --> 26:30.240
scene.

26:30.240 --> 26:33.840
But what's kind of cool about it though is they almost do like a pseudo head tracking

26:33.840 --> 26:35.440
with it using the camera.

26:35.440 --> 26:39.960
You actually tilt the system around and the camera changes angles based on how you have

26:39.960 --> 26:40.960
the system tilted.

26:40.960 --> 26:45.600
Why don't they do this technology with like DSi that might make it a lot cooler with new

26:45.600 --> 26:50.400
different games coming out that you have this neat little kind of head tracking technology

26:50.400 --> 26:51.400
built in.

26:51.400 --> 26:56.280
You know, that would be really cool and kind of a way to differentiate themselves with

26:56.280 --> 26:57.280
DSi.

26:57.280 --> 26:59.520
Because right now it's like, eh, it's a DS with a camera.

26:59.520 --> 27:01.880
They don't like to give us what we want.

27:01.880 --> 27:04.580
You know, another big problem with this is the price.

27:04.580 --> 27:07.760
I mean $200, right, or $190 or whatever it is.

27:07.760 --> 27:14.040
Something like that is supposed to be like $20 more than what the DSi is now.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.040
Yeah.

27:15.040 --> 27:19.160
But now you're also talking, you could get a Wii for the same price, right, or at least

27:19.160 --> 27:23.680
an Xbox 360 low end, right, for $199.

27:23.680 --> 27:24.760
So I don't know.

27:24.760 --> 27:28.040
I'm not really sold on, again, why I need the DSi XL.

27:28.040 --> 27:29.520
I don't have a DSi.

27:29.520 --> 27:30.520
I don't have one.

27:30.520 --> 27:33.400
I have the DS Lite, was the last Nintendo system I bought.

27:33.400 --> 27:37.640
And I probably wouldn't have even bought that if I hadn't kind of bought it as like a knee

27:37.640 --> 27:40.000
jerk thing when I was on vacation once.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.160
I would still have my DS back.

27:41.160 --> 27:46.820
This is really dumb that it's coming out for a price point that's higher than the DSi.

27:46.820 --> 27:49.000
Really what they should have done is drop the price of both systems.

27:49.000 --> 27:54.920
Maybe put out the DSi XL at the price of the current DSi and drop the price of the DSi.

27:54.920 --> 27:59.220
But even then it's like, well, do I really need a larger screen?

27:59.220 --> 28:04.960
It doesn't really enhance anything other than the graphics are slightly bigger now.

28:04.960 --> 28:05.960
I don't know.

28:05.960 --> 28:08.080
I think it's kind of unnecessary.

28:08.080 --> 28:13.120
I guess this whole ebook thing you're talking about could be interesting, but is it something

28:13.120 --> 28:15.680
that I would not be able to use on the DSi regular?

28:15.680 --> 28:16.680
No.

28:16.680 --> 28:19.120
No, you wouldn't be able to, but it'd just be slightly bigger on the, you know, and we're

28:19.120 --> 28:20.480
talking slightly bigger.

28:20.480 --> 28:24.640
I mean, it's not like the screen size is like double or triple of what the DSi is.

28:24.640 --> 28:26.120
It's still enough to fit in your pocket, right?

28:26.120 --> 28:30.980
It didn't really give me an impression of being anything that fantastic.

28:30.980 --> 28:35.800
I just, I don't understand the point of this.

28:35.800 --> 28:40.800
Ooh, maybe they're in pretty colors because that would be a big seller as if they're in

28:40.800 --> 28:44.000
like, you know, fabulous pink and sexy lavender.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.360
I don't know what the colors are going to be, but I think from what we've seen in the

28:47.360 --> 28:50.520
pictures is like they have like a wine burgundy color.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.040
Yeah, and another one's bronze.

28:52.040 --> 28:55.000
I'd get a bronze one.

28:55.000 --> 29:02.720
It's so like a third place looking color and then a Franzia looking color.

29:02.720 --> 29:07.240
Really, if you want a DSi in a specific color, there are websites out there that will give

29:07.240 --> 29:12.000
you a DSi in any color you want, or you can go to the Nintendo World store in New York

29:12.000 --> 29:13.640
and they'll give you a DSi color.

29:13.640 --> 29:15.680
I almost did that.

29:15.680 --> 29:20.080
They had like the custom DS cases and this like really there was a sexy metallic green

29:20.080 --> 29:21.080
one.

29:21.080 --> 29:22.080
I kind of wanted, but I resisted.

29:22.080 --> 29:27.680
I didn't buy it almost as you should have because you probably already have a DS and

29:27.680 --> 29:30.040
there's no reason to purchase something because of a color.

29:30.040 --> 29:33.640
There really wasn't, except the fact that it was one of the lights and I didn't have

29:33.640 --> 29:35.140
a light at that time.

29:35.140 --> 29:36.140
So I almost bought that.

29:36.140 --> 29:46.360
I did buy my, now I can't remember which letter is attached to it, my pink one because it

29:46.360 --> 29:47.360
was pink.

29:47.360 --> 29:48.360
I do feel a little...

29:48.360 --> 29:52.720
And I wanted to be different than what people expect.

29:52.720 --> 29:53.760
Mine are very generic.

29:53.760 --> 29:56.360
My DS fat is gray and my DS light is black.

29:56.360 --> 29:59.760
It's not my DS, my old SP, not the SP, the one before that.

29:59.760 --> 30:02.600
But I feel a little ridiculous having both of them at this point.

30:02.600 --> 30:05.960
I'm like, I just need to like sell one of these, but who'd buy it?

30:05.960 --> 30:07.440
Do what we do.

30:07.440 --> 30:09.560
Get another room.

30:09.560 --> 30:10.680
I don't have another room.

30:10.680 --> 30:11.680
I just moved.

30:11.680 --> 30:12.680
I had to downsize.

30:12.680 --> 30:13.680
I don't have as much room as I had before.

30:13.680 --> 30:15.520
I got boxes everywhere still.

30:15.520 --> 30:17.400
I need to get rid of things.

30:17.400 --> 30:19.560
Take my DS to the dump.

30:19.560 --> 30:22.320
All right, let's move on with some more news.

30:22.320 --> 30:23.320
Okay.

30:23.320 --> 30:27.040
So some other interesting stuff that came out of the media summit, Nintendo will be

30:27.040 --> 30:31.180
publishing Dragon Quest IX in North America.

30:31.180 --> 30:35.200
Which is kind of weird if you think about it, because Square Enix is over here.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.600
Why aren't they publishing the game?

30:36.600 --> 30:38.520
But hey, whatever.

30:38.520 --> 30:41.440
It's coming out over here sometime in the summer.

30:41.440 --> 30:46.240
And you know, with Nintendo being the one that's publishing the game, hopefully there'll

30:46.240 --> 30:48.880
be a better marketing campaign behind it.

30:48.880 --> 30:50.340
So maybe that's good.

30:50.340 --> 30:56.400
And because people buy blindly whatever Nintendo puts out, so that's always good.

30:56.400 --> 31:03.200
Another game scheduled for May coming to the DS would be Picross 3D.

31:03.200 --> 31:06.360
And kind of a cool-looking game.

31:06.360 --> 31:10.600
And of course, you know, Picross is kind of a puzzle game where you make a picture.

31:10.600 --> 31:16.440
Well, now it's going to be in three dimensions as well, and you'll break apart cubes to reveal

31:16.440 --> 31:19.980
different little cube animals and objects and stuff.

31:19.980 --> 31:22.920
So that's kind of neat.

31:22.920 --> 31:28.560
Kind of a more niche game, but Sin and Punishment 2, or what's being called over here, Sin and

31:28.560 --> 31:32.840
Punishment Star Successor will be coming out on June 7th.

31:32.840 --> 31:37.160
They had a new trailer for it as well, and it looks all sorts of sexy, and of course

31:37.160 --> 31:43.660
it's a shooter game that will be the sequel to the one that came out on Nintendo 64 way

31:43.660 --> 31:44.960
back in the day.

31:44.960 --> 31:45.960
But not in America.

31:45.960 --> 31:47.880
Not in America, no, that's true.

31:47.880 --> 31:52.440
And looks pretty cool, kind of reminded me of some Panzer Dragon stuff on there.

31:52.440 --> 31:58.600
So and then of course, WiiWare, right around the corner actually, Cave Story will be making

31:58.600 --> 32:06.920
its way out on WiiWare March 22nd with slightly upgraded graphics, and looks kind of neat.

32:06.920 --> 32:12.240
Also there's going to be some download content as well being available, including a new boss

32:12.240 --> 32:18.560
rush and sanctuary time attack mode that will be available to download.

32:18.560 --> 32:23.320
Huh, oh, I guess I take that back.

32:23.320 --> 32:24.680
I misread that.

32:24.680 --> 32:28.000
It was originally announced as download content, now it's being included.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.760
So you get it for free.

32:30.760 --> 32:33.520
Well extra stuff for free is always good.

32:33.520 --> 32:34.520
Definitely.

32:34.520 --> 32:38.880
So, any news that particularly got you excited at the Nintendo conference?

32:38.880 --> 32:44.560
I know we've kind of touched on most of the stuff.

32:44.560 --> 32:52.320
There was some other interesting stuff, like regarding Monster Hunter Tri, or I guess they're

32:52.320 --> 32:57.680
calling it Monster Hunter Tri or whatever, but we'll talk a little bit more about that

32:57.680 --> 32:58.680
later.

32:58.680 --> 32:59.680
Gotcha.

32:59.680 --> 33:04.920
I'm just, I was very interested to see that both Mario Galaxy and Metroid Other M are

33:04.920 --> 33:11.040
coming out in the second quarter, which is really unheard of that they would put both

33:11.040 --> 33:14.680
of those blockbuster games, because it's like, well crap, if you're putting out these two

33:14.680 --> 33:19.560
games now, then what the hell do you have for, you know, holiday?

33:19.560 --> 33:20.560
A new Zelda, OMG!

33:20.560 --> 33:22.840
Oh yeah, it's pretty much a new Zelda game.

33:22.840 --> 33:25.800
Well and then whatever they're going to show at E3 that might be the surprise, but that's

33:25.800 --> 33:29.160
probably the Zelda game that's not much of a surprise at this point.

33:29.160 --> 33:33.400
Remember, and I know I've said this on a show before, but New Super Mario Brothers Wii was

33:33.400 --> 33:37.200
kept under wraps until E3, it was really the surprise.

33:37.200 --> 33:41.760
Because remember the way that whole press conference went, like last year's E3 was supposed

33:41.760 --> 33:46.920
to be kind of like this apology for the year before, and last year's E3, they came out

33:46.920 --> 33:51.160
within five minutes, they were on New Super Mario Brothers Wii, and they're like, hey,

33:51.160 --> 33:55.080
it's a New Super Mario Brothers game that looks and kind of plays like the old school

33:55.080 --> 33:59.040
one, and this is what gamers want, dah dah dah, and guess what, it's out this holiday.

33:59.040 --> 34:00.040
Woohoo!

34:00.040 --> 34:01.800
And that was one of the big things they showed on the floor.

34:01.800 --> 34:07.080
You know, I'm thinking there could be another like Gotcha this year from Nintendo, except

34:07.080 --> 34:10.240
I worry it might be the Zelda game that's already kind of leaked out.

34:10.240 --> 34:14.320
I'm guessing it's going to be like a Pikmin 3, probably the new Zelda game.

34:14.320 --> 34:18.760
Wii Relax, which will be retarded, but it'll probably come out around October-ish, I think

34:18.760 --> 34:22.320
around the same time as Wii Fit Plus did this year, and I think they'll probably treat it

34:22.320 --> 34:23.320
as- Oh, the Vitality?

34:23.320 --> 34:27.880
Yeah, I think they'll probably treat it as much, you know, like the Wii Fit Plus.

34:27.880 --> 34:35.600
Not a lot of, I mean, probably not going to do as well as Wii Fit, you know, in general.

34:35.600 --> 34:40.440
I just don't see the need for that little Vitality sensor, but whatever.

34:40.440 --> 34:46.640
It would be really cool though, is to do like a new Zelda game, but like, you know, like

34:46.640 --> 34:51.600
new Super Mario Brothers style, where it's old school Zelda, but like four player and

34:51.600 --> 34:52.600
teaming up.

34:52.600 --> 34:53.600
So, the four swords.

34:53.600 --> 34:54.720
Something like that, yeah.

34:54.720 --> 34:57.280
I want a lethargy sensor.

34:57.280 --> 35:00.000
How about a Wii Vitality sensor that shocks you?

35:00.000 --> 35:01.480
You're not moving!

35:01.480 --> 35:02.480
Clear!

35:02.480 --> 35:03.480
Fang!

35:03.480 --> 35:08.280
Or just something like when you screw up in the game, it gives you a little bite of electricity

35:08.280 --> 35:09.280
or something.

35:09.280 --> 35:10.280
I don't know.

35:10.280 --> 35:11.280
Could be fun.

35:11.280 --> 35:12.280
Maybe a new Wario War game.

35:12.280 --> 35:16.680
That could be, or the fanboy in me would love to see an F-Zero game come out of nowhere.

35:16.680 --> 35:17.680
Oh god, that'd be awesome.

35:17.680 --> 35:21.480
I'm not going to hold my breath though, but that would be the whoa crap game for me.

35:21.480 --> 35:24.400
I'm still holding out for an Excite Truck 2.

35:24.400 --> 35:29.840
You know, a real Excite Truck 2, not this Excite Bots bullshit.

35:29.840 --> 35:30.840
Who knows?

35:30.840 --> 35:31.840
Anything's possible.

35:31.840 --> 35:34.840
Alright, well let's move on to some other platforms, obviously a big game going on right

35:34.840 --> 35:40.560
now is Heavy Rain on the Playstation 3, which sadly I have not gotten my hands on yet amongst

35:40.560 --> 35:43.440
all my real life stuff going on, but I do want to play it at some point, although I

35:43.440 --> 35:47.240
heard, and this is kind of like breaking news as we're taping live on this Sunday, I heard

35:47.240 --> 35:51.180
something about Playstation Network is down right now, I guess, and if you want to play

35:51.180 --> 35:53.040
Heavy Rain, you can't.

35:53.040 --> 35:54.740
Like I don't know how that works.

35:54.740 --> 35:57.280
Does the game talk to the servers somehow?

35:57.280 --> 35:59.600
Like you have to be online?

35:59.600 --> 36:04.200
I don't see how it could because, you know, what if you don't have an internet connection

36:04.200 --> 36:07.320
and you can't play the game?

36:07.320 --> 36:08.320
I don't know.

36:08.320 --> 36:09.320
Apparently something was going on.

36:09.320 --> 36:14.640
I guess there's some game crashing errors going on on the PSN and it has something to

36:14.640 --> 36:19.480
do with the dates reverting and now some of the data's corrupting or something.

36:19.480 --> 36:23.560
And yeah, the issues are preventing folks from launching games like Heavy Rain, so it

36:23.560 --> 36:27.440
sounds like the date or something might have got screwed up and now it's messing everyone

36:27.440 --> 36:28.440
up.

36:28.440 --> 36:29.440
I wonder how that works.

36:29.440 --> 36:30.440
Yikes.

36:30.440 --> 36:32.360
Well, hopefully that's fixed soon.

36:32.360 --> 36:36.440
But meanwhile, Heavy Rain was banned in another country this week.

36:36.440 --> 36:38.040
United Arab Emirates.

36:38.040 --> 36:39.800
You will not be able to play Heavy Rain.

36:39.800 --> 36:41.680
It's an official ban there.

36:41.680 --> 36:45.160
So if you are in the Middle East and you want to play this game, you're going to have to

36:45.160 --> 36:51.120
import it or something because the game was banned by the country's National Media Council.

36:51.120 --> 36:55.400
Of course, Sony has come out and said, you know, the game is an 18 plus game.

36:55.400 --> 37:01.080
It is strong content, but they didn't really respond to this particular ban.

37:01.080 --> 37:05.600
So I have a feeling they might just cut their losses since unfortunately for anybody listening

37:05.600 --> 37:09.920
who might be in the UAE, it's not one of Sony's biggest markets, so they might just be cutting

37:09.920 --> 37:12.040
their losses and hoping you guys will import it.

37:12.040 --> 37:13.800
I don't know.

37:13.800 --> 37:16.760
But it wasn't banned because of the bugs.

37:16.760 --> 37:19.080
Apparently there's some bugs going on in Heavy Rain.

37:19.080 --> 37:21.300
It has to do with just some technical things.

37:21.300 --> 37:23.680
Some audio is out of sync.

37:23.680 --> 37:25.320
The game is freezing up.

37:25.320 --> 37:29.500
There are some auto saves that turn out they can't load and for some reason everybody's

37:29.500 --> 37:31.360
speaking French.

37:31.360 --> 37:35.760
I'm just kidding about the last one sort of, but the rest, the rest is all, well, you've

37:35.760 --> 37:40.300
heard about like how Heavy Rain was made in France and was developed by a French studio.

37:40.300 --> 37:43.100
So they have all these French voice actors, but they're doing English and apparently the

37:43.100 --> 37:45.320
accent is really noticeable.

37:45.320 --> 37:46.320
Really noticeable.

37:46.320 --> 37:51.080
The PlayStation network actually got hacked because on their website there is a directory

37:51.080 --> 37:55.420
called Dear PlayStation that says get flash and or enable JavaScript and stop wasting

37:55.420 --> 37:57.200
my time.

37:57.200 --> 37:58.760
Interesting.

37:58.760 --> 38:00.920
That's funny.

38:00.920 --> 38:01.920
Yikes.

38:01.920 --> 38:06.320
So PSN might be the victim of a hack going on right now.

38:06.320 --> 38:08.480
So yeah, the game is locking up and so forth.

38:08.480 --> 38:13.560
So I guess Sony has kind of posted in their forums about it saying that they are aware

38:13.560 --> 38:16.900
of some of the issues and if you're having a particular issue, you should go to the thread

38:16.900 --> 38:21.800
and post your information because you know, this is the era of patching video games that

38:21.800 --> 38:23.800
are already broken.

38:23.800 --> 38:27.320
Isn't Sony the same service that's running a show right now about finding a video game

38:27.320 --> 38:28.320
tester?

38:28.320 --> 38:29.320
I'm going to talk about this more in part B.

38:29.320 --> 38:30.320
Yes, they are.

38:30.320 --> 38:34.960
Sony might need some more video game testers right now, so maybe you all win.

38:34.960 --> 38:38.000
Maybe everybody needs to win that show and go test Heavy Rain.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
I don't know.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.600
I will talk more about the tester in part B. I have a lot of thoughts on that, so we'll

38:41.600 --> 38:44.040
get into that a little later on in the program.

38:44.040 --> 38:48.600
But for now, more gaming news from Dark Soccer and then the release dates in a little bit.

38:48.600 --> 38:50.320
Oh, release dates.

38:50.320 --> 38:51.320
I'm looking forward.

38:51.320 --> 38:55.440
But instead, this is not something that anyone should be looking forward to.

38:55.440 --> 38:58.100
It's pretty, pretty bad.

38:58.100 --> 39:05.800
There are 12 game stores, as in a big retailer in the UK.

39:05.800 --> 39:11.440
Actually more than that, 43 are going to be closing down in the UK.

39:11.440 --> 39:16.120
That means that 247 people are going to be laid off.

39:16.120 --> 39:23.840
Or as the article says, will be a redundant, which I think is a horrible term.

39:23.840 --> 39:25.240
Also...

39:25.240 --> 39:27.160
Well that's what they call it over there though, redundancies, right?

39:27.160 --> 39:28.160
I know.

39:28.160 --> 39:29.160
I just think it's awful.

39:29.160 --> 39:30.520
It's just a terrible word.

39:30.520 --> 39:35.640
You know, hi, you're redundant, okay?

39:35.640 --> 39:39.920
Whose fault is that for creating a redundant position?

39:39.920 --> 39:41.720
The same guy who's probably laying me off.

39:41.720 --> 39:48.080
Well that's going to be a third of the stores out of a total of 682.

39:48.080 --> 39:55.280
So it's including 12 game stores and 6 game station outlets and 25 Debenham's stores.

39:55.280 --> 39:57.160
The little concessions.

39:57.160 --> 40:02.960
And just so folks not in the UK know, the store is actually called Game.

40:02.960 --> 40:05.560
So when you say a game store, you're not being vague.

40:05.560 --> 40:06.560
It's actually G-A-M-E.

40:06.560 --> 40:07.560
All caps.

40:07.560 --> 40:10.560
All caps, trademark, restricted.

40:10.560 --> 40:13.480
Would you say, and I'm not familiar, would you say, Jamie, that's kind of like their

40:13.480 --> 40:14.480
version of GameStop?

40:14.480 --> 40:16.440
Like that's their big, big industry there?

40:16.440 --> 40:17.960
I'd say it's a big one.

40:17.960 --> 40:18.960
That would be...

40:18.960 --> 40:21.760
Can you imagine if like a bunch of GameStops here shut down?

40:21.760 --> 40:25.160
Although I guess what we've had the news about GameCrazy and some of the competitors.

40:25.160 --> 40:26.160
Don't get me started on that, please.

40:26.160 --> 40:27.320
I know, I'm sorry.

40:27.320 --> 40:28.320
But you know, it's...

40:28.320 --> 40:29.920
A bunch of GameStops closed?

40:29.920 --> 40:35.320
Wow, then there'd be an adequate number of GameStops available because right now there's

40:35.320 --> 40:36.320
way too many.

40:36.320 --> 40:39.600
Yeah, they're totally cornering the market, which I think is disgusting.

40:39.600 --> 40:41.560
Don't we have antitrust laws and stuff in this?

40:41.560 --> 40:42.560
Yeah, we do.

40:42.560 --> 40:43.560
But Google's not listening.

40:43.560 --> 40:44.560
I mean, GameStop's not listening.

40:44.560 --> 40:45.560
Did I say Google?

40:45.560 --> 40:46.560
Yeah, you said Google.

40:46.560 --> 40:47.560
Yeah, well Google's on the list too.

40:47.560 --> 40:49.560
Google's always listening.

40:49.560 --> 40:53.760
Now, Google's just been on a decline in the past couple of years.

40:53.760 --> 40:54.760
Like I'm a big Google...

40:54.760 --> 40:56.640
Google's being sued for violation of antitrust.

40:56.640 --> 41:01.760
Well, you know, I'm a big Google fan, but I'm sorry, Wave was what?

41:01.760 --> 41:03.720
We don't need Google Mars.

41:03.720 --> 41:04.720
And Buzz was bad.

41:04.720 --> 41:05.720
Did you know about that?

41:05.720 --> 41:06.720
Did you know about Google Mars?

41:06.720 --> 41:07.720
Google Mars.

41:07.720 --> 41:08.720
That's the maps on Mars, right?

41:08.720 --> 41:09.720
Yes.

41:09.720 --> 41:10.720
I think that's cool.

41:10.720 --> 41:11.720
It's cool, but it doesn't look very good.

41:11.720 --> 41:12.720
And why do we need to...

41:12.720 --> 41:15.600
Can't we just go to NASA's website or something?

41:15.600 --> 41:17.480
I'm okay with Google Mars.

41:17.480 --> 41:19.320
You know, it's Earth in the style...

41:19.320 --> 41:21.520
But it's Mars in the style of Google Earth.

41:21.520 --> 41:22.520
I'm okay with that.

41:22.520 --> 41:23.520
What about Google Veronica Mars?

41:23.520 --> 41:24.520
Buzz!

41:24.520 --> 41:25.520
Google Veronica Mars would be cool.

41:25.520 --> 41:26.520
I don't need that for that.

41:26.520 --> 41:28.960
Buzz was bad.

41:28.960 --> 41:30.280
Buzz was a bad idea.

41:30.280 --> 41:31.280
What was Buzz?

41:31.280 --> 41:32.280
I didn't hear about that.

41:32.280 --> 41:37.520
It was their response to Twitter, but the problem was it automatically added the 40

41:37.520 --> 41:42.080
most common people you email to your Buzz friends list, and if somebody went to your

41:42.080 --> 41:45.760
public profile, they could see the 40 people you email the most.

41:45.760 --> 41:51.760
So if one of them happens to be like an ex, or, you know, a boss is emailing his secretary

41:51.760 --> 41:54.000
on a personal email, everybody could see that.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
Or a porn finder.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
Exactly.

41:56.000 --> 42:02.360
Like, whoever thought that was a good idea needs to be made redundant.

42:02.360 --> 42:03.360
Honestly.

42:03.360 --> 42:06.040
Well, if they were going to do something like that, they should have it as an option that

42:06.040 --> 42:07.040
you could select.

42:07.040 --> 42:08.040
It's ridiculous.

42:08.040 --> 42:12.040
Well, now they backtracked, but they botched the launch of that thing, and now nobody's

42:12.040 --> 42:13.040
going to trust it.

42:13.040 --> 42:17.400
So they might as well just nuke Buzz, nuke Wave, and start again.

42:17.400 --> 42:18.400
Google Buzz Wave.

42:18.400 --> 42:20.440
I am sick of the social networking, by the way.

42:20.440 --> 42:22.720
It's like I was posting on my Facebook earlier.

42:22.720 --> 42:25.760
I'm sick of social networking, yet I'm compelled to still do it.

42:25.760 --> 42:26.760
I am, too.

42:26.760 --> 42:29.800
You know, Tangent Train, choo choo.

42:29.800 --> 42:30.800
Okay.

42:30.800 --> 42:37.440
There's this whole email that came out this week from Bizarre Creations, who's a studio

42:37.440 --> 42:38.440
I really respect.

42:38.440 --> 42:39.440
They're great.

42:39.440 --> 42:40.440
They make a lot of great stuff.

42:40.440 --> 42:42.340
And I'm really looking forward to Blur.

42:42.340 --> 42:45.560
Just as a gamer, that was one of the fun games I played at E3.

42:45.560 --> 42:50.720
But they were talking about how they have fully integrated Twitter into Blur, and how

42:50.720 --> 42:54.520
you can actually tweet while driving in Blur.

42:54.520 --> 42:58.760
And not just necessarily making, and I apologize because I don't have the press release in

42:58.760 --> 43:02.480
front of me, so I hope I'm not misstating anything, but I believe it was so far as,

43:02.480 --> 43:07.920
you can hit the left bumper, and you can automatically send to your Twitter what you are doing in

43:07.920 --> 43:08.920
Blur.

43:08.920 --> 43:10.580
That's just ridiculous.

43:10.580 --> 43:13.960
And I'm just thinking, okay, I get what they're trying to do.

43:13.960 --> 43:18.560
Like here at OLR, we try to embrace all social networking when it comes out, because we want

43:18.560 --> 43:21.920
to be where every gamer has a voice, and we want people to interact with us.

43:21.920 --> 43:25.680
And I get that Bizzare is trying to be on the cutting edge.

43:25.680 --> 43:27.760
So for that, I say, okay, cool.

43:27.760 --> 43:30.880
But there's the other part of me that goes, God, as if Twitter didn't have enough bullshit

43:30.880 --> 43:31.880
on it already.

43:31.880 --> 43:35.440
Like, honestly, guys, I'm just straight up with this whole social networking thing.

43:35.440 --> 43:36.760
And I've told people this.

43:36.760 --> 43:41.840
If you post important news about your life on Facebook, and are going to give me a pop

43:41.840 --> 43:46.640
quiz on it later, or expect me to know that like you are getting engaged because the only

43:46.640 --> 43:49.840
place you said anything was Facebook, I'm sorry.

43:49.840 --> 43:50.840
That doesn't fly with me.

43:50.840 --> 43:56.360
Like, if you want me to know what's going on with you, text, email, you know, I like

43:56.360 --> 44:00.300
to think those are kind of modern things or call, pick up the phone, dial the numbers

44:00.300 --> 44:01.520
and call.

44:01.520 --> 44:02.520
You know what?

44:02.520 --> 44:03.520
I have to read this list.

44:03.520 --> 44:10.280
And as a poster that was done by the oatmeal, the 10 things you need to stop tweeting about.

44:10.280 --> 44:11.280
Have you seen that Rob?

44:11.280 --> 44:12.280
No, I have not.

44:12.280 --> 44:13.680
One, what are you eating?

44:13.680 --> 44:18.120
I had meatloaf for breakfast, lol please RT.

44:18.120 --> 44:22.400
Social media, the conference or event that you're at.

44:22.400 --> 44:23.400
Twitter itself.

44:23.400 --> 44:27.360
Well, now wait a minute though, because Twitter, like we did the tweet thing for me three and

44:27.360 --> 44:30.440
I think a lot of people like that because we were pictures in the, that was reporting

44:30.440 --> 44:31.660
news.

44:31.660 --> 44:37.840
This example is using, it's like a total, so and so totally owned that last session

44:37.840 --> 44:39.720
on optimizing your Twitter background pic.

44:39.720 --> 44:40.720
I get what you're saying.

44:40.720 --> 44:41.720
You know what?

44:41.720 --> 44:43.760
There's a girl on my friends list and I love her to death.

44:43.760 --> 44:50.000
I think she's amazing, but she posts so many updates whenever she's at like a concert for

44:50.000 --> 44:55.220
a former American Idol or something like it just fills up my page and I can't see anybody

44:55.220 --> 45:00.400
else's list and I'm kind of just thinking like, can you post a live journal or somewhere

45:00.400 --> 45:01.400
where you can make long posts?

45:01.400 --> 45:06.000
The other one on here is your workout, your kid, dog, cat, goat or whatever else.

45:06.000 --> 45:10.940
Speaking out of context, as in people who just say nonsense, daily booth photos, emotional

45:10.940 --> 45:15.880
breakthroughs and the number of like posting the daily picture of yourself.

45:15.880 --> 45:19.280
Oh, like where it's the same picture of me every day flexing and looking cute.

45:19.280 --> 45:20.280
Yeah.

45:20.280 --> 45:21.280
Okay.

45:21.280 --> 45:22.280
Emotional breakthroughs and the number of followers you have.

45:22.280 --> 45:23.280
Oh yeah.

45:23.280 --> 45:27.680
That's, and that's, that's so tacky when somebody posts like, I have a thousand followers.

45:27.680 --> 45:31.000
Well, I'll have to tell you, now you don't.

45:31.000 --> 45:32.800
Now you have nine 99 click.

45:32.800 --> 45:38.040
I have to tell you the, what, what hit me today and I actually, I use Twitter now for

45:38.040 --> 45:41.120
more of a professional networking.

45:41.120 --> 45:43.460
I follow a lot of other designers.

45:43.460 --> 45:47.880
I follow people in the comic book industry and I actually get something out of, you know,

45:47.880 --> 45:52.320
and yeah, it's not that I don't care about the people on Twitter.

45:52.320 --> 45:53.440
You know what I mean?

45:53.440 --> 45:57.980
It's just that I really don't need to know how big of a poop you took or I, you know,

45:57.980 --> 46:02.080
I'm sure your baby is cute, but I would rather have something meaningful.

46:02.080 --> 46:05.920
I honestly, I feel like the biggest hypocrite when it comes to Twitter because most of the

46:05.920 --> 46:10.200
stuff I tweet these days have to do with video games and I kind of use it like for OLR related

46:10.200 --> 46:12.920
things and to keep tabs on the OLR fans.

46:12.920 --> 46:15.440
But I, I don't like reading that stuff.

46:15.440 --> 46:19.480
Like when I look at my fans list and it's, it's like a bunch of other podcasters promoting

46:19.480 --> 46:20.480
their shows.

46:20.480 --> 46:21.820
I'm like, yeah, okay, I know you have a show.

46:21.820 --> 46:22.820
I get it.

46:22.820 --> 46:27.980
But as in here I am tweeting, Hey, listen to OLR tonight, you know, Twitter makes me

46:27.980 --> 46:28.980
feel dirty.

46:28.980 --> 46:32.400
Well, let's just say, you know, we, we have problems with it yet.

46:32.400 --> 46:34.800
We feel compelled to use it, right?

46:34.800 --> 46:38.960
Because it is now a part of our culture.

46:38.960 --> 46:44.320
If you think about it, it's really, uh, why it's not cool anymore.

46:44.320 --> 46:49.980
In Facebook, I have a little bit more love for because I use that as my mini blog.

46:49.980 --> 46:53.320
That's actually, I go back and check on it cause I usually just put my to do list up

46:53.320 --> 46:54.320
there.

46:54.320 --> 46:56.000
Like what do I need to get done today and refer back to it.

46:56.000 --> 46:59.360
But I've actually not even been, you know, I'm actually making a conscious effort not

46:59.360 --> 47:03.640
to use either of them so much and actually keep a notebook with me and use my live journal

47:03.640 --> 47:04.960
and my blog.

47:04.960 --> 47:09.960
Well the thing that freaks me out is that like CNN uses Twitter as like a real source

47:09.960 --> 47:10.960
now.

47:10.960 --> 47:12.800
And that kind of weirds me out a little bit.

47:12.800 --> 47:18.160
Like when, when boner died this week, right here, the celebrity from, he was boner on

47:18.160 --> 47:19.160
growing pains.

47:19.160 --> 47:20.160
Chekhov's kid.

47:20.160 --> 47:21.160
Yeah.

47:21.160 --> 47:22.160
Oh yeah.

47:22.160 --> 47:23.160
Chekhov's kid.

47:23.160 --> 47:25.680
Um, you know, unfortunately very tragic, sad, you know, what have you.

47:25.680 --> 47:32.880
But CNN went to Twitter to see what all the other celebrities who knew him like Kirk Cameron

47:32.880 --> 47:36.800
and you know, the people that would have worked with him before were saying about him.

47:36.800 --> 47:40.160
And I don't know, like I just, I read the story and I just kind of thought whatever

47:40.160 --> 47:45.860
happened to like, he's um, he does a lot of Jesus stuff.

47:45.860 --> 47:50.460
Like you would find his works at the Bible houses and yeah, those types of places.

47:50.460 --> 47:56.120
But anyway, uh, he was in the, um, movie for, uh, left behind, left behind.

47:56.120 --> 47:57.600
I keep thinking left for dead.

47:57.600 --> 47:58.600
No, not that movie.

47:58.600 --> 47:59.600
That's a different movie.

47:59.600 --> 48:00.600
Left behind.

48:00.600 --> 48:01.600
That's it.

48:01.600 --> 48:02.600
The rapture movie.

48:02.600 --> 48:03.600
Yeah.

48:03.600 --> 48:08.000
But my whole thing is that CNN is running this report about what all the celebs on Twitter

48:08.000 --> 48:12.600
are saying and I can't help but think like whatever happened to actual reporting?

48:12.600 --> 48:13.600
I know.

48:13.600 --> 48:14.600
Well, this is, this is my thought.

48:14.600 --> 48:16.680
Like I can use Google and Twitter.

48:16.680 --> 48:22.180
Is it when they're doing editorials and when it get like a viewer feedback?

48:22.180 --> 48:23.180
That's a good thing.

48:23.180 --> 48:26.540
You know, the same reason why we have the chat room, you know, when we talk about an

48:26.540 --> 48:30.240
actual story and we want to see what people think about it, it's, I think, look at it

48:30.240 --> 48:34.700
as that equivalent, but in, it's a fine line.

48:34.700 --> 48:39.920
It's a really fine line and you know, that's why I think there's legitimate uses for it.

48:39.920 --> 48:43.960
I think, you know, a lot of people honestly are using it to validate themselves.

48:43.960 --> 48:49.160
Whereas, you know, if, if you want to share something important with people, it's a good

48:49.160 --> 48:50.160
way to do it.

48:50.160 --> 48:53.680
If you want to see what other people are doing in your industry, it's a good thing to find

48:53.680 --> 48:55.700
out other people that are in your industry.

48:55.700 --> 49:01.280
But I'm really just getting like a, like so tired of the, Oh, I had to poop today.

49:01.280 --> 49:02.280
Yeah.

49:02.280 --> 49:03.280
Yeah.

49:03.280 --> 49:06.400
Nobody's going to retweet you and then say, I'm so glad your colon is working properly.

49:06.400 --> 49:09.200
You know, some people do reply to that.

49:09.200 --> 49:11.540
Don't, don't get me started.

49:11.540 --> 49:16.320
And yeah, I've, I've posted really inane stuff on there too, but I actually just, uh, detached

49:16.320 --> 49:24.240
my, uh, loud Twitter feed from my live journal and I, cause of the, whatever, yay.

49:24.240 --> 49:27.320
Last thing I hate most about Twitter is that it's invading live journal.

49:27.320 --> 49:28.320
Yay.

49:28.320 --> 49:29.320
Gold star for Jamie.

49:29.320 --> 49:30.360
I'm so happy.

49:30.360 --> 49:34.560
Over the last few weeks, I would just go back and check my loud Twitter feed and like I

49:34.560 --> 49:38.840
posted one thing, why?

49:38.840 --> 49:43.080
I just now do it to keep up with other people, you know, or if I have something to announce,

49:43.080 --> 49:48.320
like that's important, like come to my birthday party or I'm going to be going to LA.

49:48.320 --> 49:50.120
I would like to meet up with my friends there.

49:50.120 --> 49:51.680
That type of thing.

49:51.680 --> 49:56.360
That's a little bit more reasonable instead of, Oh, um, I had some, uh, we'd a Bix for

49:56.360 --> 49:57.360
breakfast.

49:57.360 --> 49:58.360
Yeah.

49:58.360 --> 49:59.360
I don't know.

49:59.360 --> 50:02.000
I know we're on this big tangent with social networking, but it's just, it's, we're in

50:02.000 --> 50:05.520
a weird place right now where it's, it's kind of like the honeymoon phase is over with the

50:05.520 --> 50:06.520
Twitter and the Facebook.

50:06.520 --> 50:10.360
And now it's like, okay, I'm linking this poster to the chat room.

50:10.360 --> 50:12.600
If you have some thoughts, why not email them to us?

50:12.600 --> 50:16.560
Mailbag orange launch radio.com or we'll probably get some phone calls on it later in the show

50:16.560 --> 50:19.960
for now though, we want to get to the classic game of the week, but not before we do release

50:19.960 --> 50:21.600
dates and a couple more news stories.

50:21.600 --> 50:24.760
So let's travel around the world and see what's coming out in the various countries.

50:24.760 --> 50:25.760
Loki.

50:25.760 --> 50:26.760
Yes.

50:26.760 --> 50:27.760
Um, this week there's actually some pretty good stuff coming out.

50:27.760 --> 50:32.920
Uh, sins of a solar empire Trinity actually, uh, coming out this week as well.

50:32.920 --> 50:38.040
Uh, Dante's Inferno make his way out on PSP was a little delayed from the other games

50:38.040 --> 50:39.040
finals month.

50:39.040 --> 50:44.660
Uh, Alison Wonderland, they have that coming out in DS and on the, we, the we version being

50:44.660 --> 50:50.400
more like the movie, the DS version being more like Beetlejuice, the cartoon, at least

50:50.400 --> 50:52.960
that's what it looks like in the picture.

50:52.960 --> 51:01.680
Um, lunar silver, silver star harmony limited edition coming out on PSP deck of sports on

51:01.680 --> 51:08.280
the DS this week, sponge Bob's boating bash coming out on the Nintendo DS and on the week

51:08.280 --> 51:11.160
kind of a demolition Derby type of game.

51:11.160 --> 51:20.180
MLB two K 10 coming out on PlayStation two PS three X-Box three 60 we DS and PSP also

51:20.180 --> 51:26.560
coming out from Sony MLB 10 the show, which is on all Sony platforms, PS two, PS three

51:26.560 --> 51:28.200
and PSP.

51:28.200 --> 51:37.000
Um, battle of giants, mutant insects, kind of a little fighting game from Ubisoft, uh,

51:37.000 --> 51:42.000
battlefield bad company two coming out on PlayStation three X-Box three 60 and PC this

51:42.000 --> 51:49.440
week silent hunter five battle of the Atlantic coming out on PC.

51:49.440 --> 51:54.880
Supreme commander two coming out from square Enix on PC as well.

51:54.880 --> 52:02.720
And lips party classics coming out on X-Box three 60 and that is it.

52:02.720 --> 52:06.600
I saw a new commercial for lips this week that I guess uses Lily Allen sort of as the

52:06.600 --> 52:08.160
centerpiece of it.

52:08.160 --> 52:09.160
Yeah.

52:09.160 --> 52:10.720
I wasn't that impressed.

52:10.720 --> 52:12.200
I don't know.

52:12.200 --> 52:17.240
I guess I'm, maybe I'm just, I'm surprised anybody buys lips to be honest.

52:17.240 --> 52:18.240
Well I buy sink star.

52:18.240 --> 52:22.640
I mean, yeah, but I understand seeing star cause there's an actual following for that,

52:22.640 --> 52:23.880
but lips is not so much.

52:23.880 --> 52:26.000
It's like they're trying to keep putting game.

52:26.000 --> 52:29.040
I think lips was kind of put out as a response to sing star.

52:29.040 --> 52:32.720
You know, if lips had come first, I probably would have been on the lips.

52:32.720 --> 52:35.480
It's just seeing star seems to be easier to use.

52:35.480 --> 52:38.000
Well seeing star also has like the real, well I guess lips does too.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
I don't know.

52:39.000 --> 52:42.000
I know seeing star like it just has all the real videos integrated and you know, it's

52:42.000 --> 52:44.100
a really great party game, but it does too.

52:44.100 --> 52:48.440
But the thing I thought with lips was it was supposed to be able to integrate any music

52:48.440 --> 52:52.480
that you had in kind of turned into a karaoke version, but.

52:52.480 --> 52:53.480
I believe it does.

52:53.480 --> 52:54.480
It's just kind of wonky.

52:54.480 --> 52:59.180
It's not the greatest implementation, you know, it's basically using one of those.

52:59.180 --> 53:03.440
You can use a filter in like Adobe audition to take out vocals too, but it's, it's a little

53:03.440 --> 53:04.440
hit and miss.

53:04.440 --> 53:08.240
There's even some MP3 plugins that do that for Winamp, but it's a little hit and miss

53:08.240 --> 53:11.920
cause it's just looking, I don't know how the science of it works, but it looks at a

53:11.920 --> 53:15.960
certain component of the track of the song and kind of removes it and sometimes it works

53:15.960 --> 53:17.960
and sometimes it doesn't.

53:17.960 --> 53:18.960
Oh well.

53:18.960 --> 53:24.520
Anyhow, moving on to the Xbox 360 in Japan and looking at Japanese release dates.

53:24.520 --> 53:30.240
Bioshock 2 comes out this week on March 4th as well as Nobunaga no Yabutendo comes out

53:30.240 --> 53:33.360
and I believe that was on the PS3 a couple weeks ago cause I seem to remember talking

53:33.360 --> 53:34.360
about that game before.

53:34.360 --> 53:38.880
But yeah, localized version of Bioshock 2 also on the 360 this week in Japan.

53:38.880 --> 53:43.880
Moving on to the PlayStation 3, no there's Nobunaga no Yabutendo again, so maybe it was

53:43.880 --> 53:45.480
pushed back a little, I don't know.

53:45.480 --> 53:50.440
But there it is on the PlayStation 3, also Bioshock 2 on the PlayStation 3 as well.

53:50.440 --> 53:53.020
Maybe this is actually, you know what this is, no this is different.

53:53.020 --> 53:56.660
This is not the Dynasty Warriors, this actually looks like Nobunaga's Ambition.

53:56.660 --> 53:58.920
This looks like a next gen version of it.

53:58.920 --> 54:02.520
You know, I can't read the Japanese, but just looking at the interface, it looks like they're

54:02.520 --> 54:05.500
picking the different city layouts and so forth.

54:05.500 --> 54:11.360
So if you know the Nobunaga Ambition series of games, I don't know how to explain it in

54:11.360 --> 54:12.360
a nutshell.

54:12.360 --> 54:17.920
It's basically an RTS-ish kind of game that's about Japanese feudalism, I guess is the easiest

54:17.920 --> 54:19.240
way for me to sum it up.

54:19.240 --> 54:20.800
It's a feudal Japan sim.

54:20.800 --> 54:25.560
I liked the old school one on the NES, but boy that game's evolved quickly over time.

54:25.560 --> 54:30.360
That one on PlayStation 2 a few years back, that was the last one I remembered that came

54:30.360 --> 54:31.360
out over here.

54:31.360 --> 54:32.360
Oh there's a new one coming out.

54:32.360 --> 54:36.440
On the Nintendo Wii, nothing this week believe it or not, but next week Taiko no Tatsujin,

54:36.440 --> 54:39.800
I know our music game fans might be familiar with that one, Taiko no Tatsujin makes its

54:39.800 --> 54:42.320
way to the Wii next week, and that's March 11th, not this week.

54:42.320 --> 54:43.320
Is that another one?

54:43.320 --> 54:44.320
Like a sequel?

54:44.320 --> 54:45.320
Because I thought they had one over there already.

54:45.320 --> 54:47.960
I thought they had one there already too, but this must be, uh...

54:47.960 --> 54:50.200
Is this the one with the inflatable drum?

54:50.200 --> 54:51.900
I believe it is.

54:51.900 --> 54:56.560
Or this could also be a price reduction, or it could be the game, because yeah, they're

54:56.560 --> 54:57.560
only...

54:57.560 --> 55:05.680
I think this is maybe the game by itself without the drum, is probably what it is.

55:05.680 --> 55:09.200
On the PlayStation 2 this week, nothing, again nothing.

55:09.200 --> 55:13.440
On the Nintendo DS though, a lot of Dragon Quest games are going into the Ultimate Hits

55:13.440 --> 55:20.920
collection, that would be 4, 9, and 5 all get price reductions from Squeenix as well

55:20.920 --> 55:24.880
as Final Fantasy 4, so it's a big week for price reductions.

55:24.880 --> 55:31.080
Otherwise, there is Bomberman Touchland, Star Bomber No Miracle World gets a price reduction

55:31.080 --> 55:35.640
as well, and probably a big, big release this week in Japan, which is why everything else

55:35.640 --> 55:42.040
is kind of limited this week, Pokemon Ranger, Hikari no Kiseki comes out this week.

55:42.040 --> 55:49.560
This is different, this is not like the gold and silver in those games, but yeah, it's

55:49.560 --> 55:50.560
a new Pokemon game.

55:50.560 --> 55:51.560
I think that's what that means.

55:51.560 --> 55:55.880
Here's the little description here, the Pokemon nappers are catching Pokemon and involving

55:55.880 --> 56:04.800
them in shady activities, there are more than 300 species of Pokeporns, most of them you've

56:04.800 --> 56:08.960
seen in HeartGold and Silver, and then you tame them and you can get them to join you

56:08.960 --> 56:12.520
in battle, but it's not, like I'm just looking at the screenshots, it's not the same type

56:12.520 --> 56:17.680
of game as the other games, this looks a little more action-y, actually, for some reason.

56:17.680 --> 56:19.000
Like a tactics game?

56:19.000 --> 56:24.320
No, it looks like it's almost like mini-games, see how it's kind of like first person, flight

56:24.320 --> 56:28.440
type of game there, and then this one looks like some type of running, this one looks

56:28.440 --> 56:31.520
like they're drawing on the DS screen.

56:31.520 --> 56:36.200
It looks like it's almost like a mix of mini-games and Pokemon or something.

56:36.200 --> 56:39.320
So there you go.

56:39.320 --> 56:46.760
Lastly on the PSP,.hack//Link comes out on the PSP, that's another big release, so check

56:46.760 --> 56:47.760
that out.

56:47.760 --> 56:52.640
If you're a fan of the.hack// series, the PSP gets a new.hack// game this week.

56:52.640 --> 56:57.600
They call it the grand finale you've all been waiting for.

56:57.600 --> 56:58.600
Good luck.

56:58.600 --> 57:01.560
Let's move to the UK, DarkSakura.

57:01.560 --> 57:03.560
I'd like to.

57:03.560 --> 57:04.560
Can we move there?

57:04.560 --> 57:07.240
Um, no, I can't afford it.

57:07.240 --> 57:08.240
Damn, okay.

57:08.240 --> 57:14.720
Well, on the 3rd of March we have Toy Soldiers, on the 5th we have Alice in Wonderland, and

57:14.720 --> 57:21.760
then Assassin's Creed 2 for PC, Battlefield Bad Company 2, BlazBlue Calamity Trigger,

57:21.760 --> 57:29.840
Dementium 2 on the DS, Picross 3D, Silent Hunter 5 by Ubisoft, and Supreme Hunter 2,

57:29.840 --> 57:35.040
and Sushi Go Round for the DS and the Wii.

57:35.040 --> 57:36.040
Sushi.

57:36.040 --> 57:38.040
Yay, Sushi.

57:38.040 --> 57:41.560
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys and then we're going to get into the

57:41.560 --> 57:44.840
classic game of the week and I'll just give you a little hint.

57:44.840 --> 57:47.920
I'm not going to give away what DarkSakura's picked, I'm just going to say it's really

57:47.920 --> 57:48.920
old.

57:48.920 --> 57:52.760
But that's not a bad thing.

57:52.760 --> 57:54.760
Oh yeah.

57:54.760 --> 58:01.640
So apparently Activision is being sued for false patent marketing and what that is is

58:01.640 --> 58:09.060
basically that Activision is filing patents for its products that are beyond the scope

58:09.060 --> 58:13.760
of what it's producing, for example.

58:13.760 --> 58:22.280
There's patent 753, which is basically a DDR pad, which wouldn't necessarily apply to Guitar

58:22.280 --> 58:28.920
Hero, which is what it's under, or 689, which is a DJ Hero turntable, which doesn't really

58:28.920 --> 58:34.280
work with Guitar Hero 5 or Band Hero.

58:34.280 --> 58:40.880
Apparently they're just putting out patents for different things in C16.

58:40.880 --> 58:46.320
And this is, the group behind this is a patent compliance group.

58:46.320 --> 58:51.420
They're seeking, this is almost to the point where it's retarded, they're seeking $500

58:51.420 --> 58:54.280
for each Activision violation.

58:54.280 --> 58:59.280
$500, really.

58:59.280 --> 59:06.920
So but apparently they're also targeting other companies as well.

59:06.920 --> 59:09.040
Just Activision happens to be one of those.

59:09.040 --> 59:18.960
And according to Mark Mathenitis, the question is one that actually penalizes false marking

59:18.960 --> 59:21.800
that a product is patented or patent pending.

59:21.800 --> 59:26.560
The idea that those false markings might deter someone from trying to create something new

59:26.560 --> 59:28.400
in that area.

59:28.400 --> 59:35.120
So basically, hey look, we have a patent for a DDR controller, you can't make any dance

59:35.120 --> 59:36.120
games.

59:36.120 --> 59:38.120
It's like they're calling dibs on everything.

59:38.120 --> 59:40.760
Dibs on this, dibs on this, dibs on this, and then they don't do anything with it.

59:40.760 --> 59:44.280
And we're going to get into another story a little later on tonight about something

59:44.280 --> 59:46.720
that they're like, nope, nope, can't have it, it's ours.

59:46.720 --> 59:52.240
And they're not going to do anything with it.

59:52.240 --> 59:56.600
As much as a silly lawsuit as this sounds, I'm glad someone's calling them on it because

59:56.600 --> 59:58.580
now Activision is going to have to respond to this.

59:58.580 --> 01:00:01.840
Has Activision made a response to this?

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:08.080
They haven't made a response yet, but at the same time, I don't see how they can, you know,

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:11.880
patent a DDR pad when a DDR pad's already been made, you know what I mean?

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:15.460
It's like, you can't patent something that already exists.

01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:17.960
You can't say, hey look, I invented the rock.

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:21.640
Now you all owe me money because you have rocks.

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:25.040
Well maybe they changed a couple of little things here.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:26.560
That's how it works.

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:29.680
One law in this country is really weird, really weird.

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:34.120
They change one or two things and claim it that they invented the genre, yeah.

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:35.120
We know how that works.

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:36.680
Yeah, right.

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:39.640
So we'll see what comes forth of that.

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:42.840
I'm really looking forward to what Activision has to say about that.

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:45.760
Remember when Activision was like the best game company in the world because they made

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:49.840
games like Pitfall and Kaboom and Keystone Capers?

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:52.080
Then Bobby Kotick came along.

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:53.880
His days are numbered, I'm telling you.

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:57.680
His days are numbered because he looks, just lately in the past couple of years he's come

01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:04.320
out and looked like a buffoon and nobody likes, nobody likes their CEO to be a douche.

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:07.320
Hey, how about something for free?

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:08.320
Free games.

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:11.460
Now this is the way to do business, Activision Take Notes.

01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:12.460
Free games.

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:14.480
Actually I'll tell you even better than that, Dark Sakura.

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:15.860
Free Pagle.

01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:16.860
That's right.

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:17.860
Free Pagle.

01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:18.860
Crack.

01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:22.120
There is a promotion going on right now where you can get Pagle Knights for yourself or

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:25.440
a loved one, family member, or even an enemy if you want, I don't care.

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:31.280
All you have to do, you sign up for PopCap's newsletter by going to popcap.com.

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:34.960
By the way, of course, that means they're going to spam your email with all the newsletters,

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:38.260
but hey, I don't know about you, I have an email just set up for spam.

01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:41.000
So to sign up for different websites, bug me not.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.680
So yeah, there you go.

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:47.400
There's also websites with disposable email addresses that'll last for about ten minutes,

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:51.920
enough time for them to send you back your confirmation code and then poof, it's gone.

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:52.920
Nice.

01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:57.240
I always liked the idea of setting up my own domain.

01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:01.280
I had a friend that did this, had his own domain that he set up for email addresses.

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:05.480
And what he would do is when he would sign up for websites, he would create a new email

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:12.760
account on his domain that was like, you know, whatever his name was, we'll say, uh, john.

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:15.440
And then whatever the name of the site was that he was signing up for.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:19.040
So when all the spam emails started coming in, he would know exactly what site was doing

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:22.960
it because he custom made email addresses for every website he signed up for.

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:23.960
I think that's a great idea.

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:28.520
Of course, I don't know if he posted those results anywhere, but he should.

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:31.960
So I think I'd like to know what websites are selling my email address.

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:34.040
I'll kick their butt.

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:36.160
Question from our chat room.

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:40.160
Uh, Kossin, and I apologize if I'm saying that wrong, but Kossin says, what's the disposable

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.560
email site called?

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:44.840
I don't remember, but I saw it in 2600 Magazine a while back.

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:49.200
Apparently if there's a few of them, because gold anthro follows up with disposable.com

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:54.080
and RoboKun says meltmail.com disposable, I think is the one I was thinking of.

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:56.080
And Toa Gak just simply says there are lots of them.

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:59.800
So there's a few of them out there wherever they can stick a banner ad.

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:01.280
That's that's what they're going to do.

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:04.960
All right, we're going to get into a segment here on the show that we love to do every

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:05.960
week.

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:09.280
It's the classic game of the week.

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:13.040
And during the classic game of the week, we encourage dark soccer to dive into the vault

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:18.640
of classic gaming and find a game that she says, you know what, kids and adults too,

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:23.360
you should be playing this game this week because it's a it's a classic game.

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:25.480
And if you're not playing this, you're a buffoon.

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:26.480
Yeah.

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:27.480
Dark soccer.

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:28.480
But phone.

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:30.540
So what should the non buffoons be playing this week?

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:36.640
The game is venture from 1981 Wow, that's old.

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:37.640
Yeah, that's older than most.

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:40.520
I was five when this game came out.

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:43.160
So since this is such an old game, there's not a lot of music.

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:46.680
But let's play there's actually plenty of music in this one with some ambient noises

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:47.680
and stuff.

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:48.680
No, it's a lot of music.

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:49.680
Listen.

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:59.400
The one posted here is actually the clique of vision version specifically, because I

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:03.040
played a crap ton of this on clique of vision.

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:08.640
But the game is where you're this little guy named Winky who looks like kind of a sperm.

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:15.040
I mean, kind of like a yeah, whatever he's this little blob with a bow and arrow.

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:19.360
And he walks around this hall where these big things that I used to call them boogers

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:23.580
when I when I was playing this as a kid.

01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:27.080
But they're just these tentacled hall monsters.

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:28.080
You can't kill them.

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:29.220
You can't stop them.

01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:32.360
They're just completely invulnerable.

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:39.920
And with with that, you actually have to go into these four or five rooms per area and

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:43.680
then get the treasure that's in each room while you're shooting and avoiding the little

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:44.680
creatures inside.

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:48.400
And each one has their own theme.

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:53.960
If you touch one of the monsters, it's called you're getting carrioned.

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:58.720
Which I thought, like, you hear that noise?

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:01.640
That's when one of the when you've been hanging out in the room too long and the hall monster

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:02.640
comes after you.

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:03.640
I see.

01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:07.040
Or I guess now that I'm a little bit older, I can call it Cthulhu face.

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:11.460
But you can you can do a little bit of dodging here and there.

01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:16.920
You can and the thing is that you can't run into the corpses of the things that you shoot

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:19.380
or they'll kill you too.

01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:23.720
And they'll block your path until they fade from the screen.

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:25.720
And you've got different types of dungeons.

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:28.320
You cannot touch a corpse because they're smelly.

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:30.400
You'll get carrioned.

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:33.760
In level one you've got the wall room, the serpent room, the skeleton room, the goblin

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:34.760
room.

01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:38.240
In level two you have the two-headed room, the dragon room, the spider room, the troll

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:39.240
room.

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:40.240
I can tell you the dragon room was pain in the ass.

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:47.040
Level three you have the genie room, the demon room, the cyclops room, and the bat room.

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:48.500
But I freaking love this game.

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:52.020
This is kind of weird because I noticed that, like, you know, especially for being such

01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:57.240
an old game, like you have this screen that's like zoomed out showing all the different

01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:59.600
rooms and then you kind of like go into one room.

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:00.600
That's the dragon room, by the way.

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:01.600
That's interesting.

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:02.600
Pain in the ass.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:11.480
But now this is one of those games, keep in mind, I had a clique-o-vision for a long time.

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:16.360
Like I remember MTV coming out and me having a clique-o-vision.

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:20.960
I remember those in a span of, you know, when I lived in the same house.

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:23.440
I'll put it that way.

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:30.320
And this was, my mother used to play a lot of this.

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:31.880
Actually my mom's favorite game was Space Fury.

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:32.880
Do you remember that?

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:35.000
No, because I didn't have a clique-o-vision.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.600
Space Fury was kind of like an asteroids kind of game.

01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:43.200
And this is the type of stuff that I bet is coming to Microsoft's game room.

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:47.080
When they talk about like a thousand classic games, you're going to see somebody digging

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:50.880
into the back catalog of a lot of the old systems like clique-o-vision and Atari.

01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:53.480
I could probably make this in Flash now.

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:56.840
I mean, seriously, I probably know enough Flash now to make this game.

01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:58.800
I'm sure there's clones out there.

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:04.240
Oh yeah, but honestly it was, this was seriously one of my favorite games when I was a little

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:05.240
kid.

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:09.640
And I love the little dinky music, I'd go around humming this one to myself when I was

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:10.640
a kid.

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:16.320
But I mean, you know, the games that I had at the time, I had like Mouse Trap and Carnival.

01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:18.100
But this one got tons of play.

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:21.800
This one and Turbo, but...

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:22.800
Alright.

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:26.980
And it actually had pretty good music for when it came out.

01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:29.120
For 81, yeah.

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:32.400
So there you go, your classic video game of the week, Venture.

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:36.520
It was an arcade game too, but I guess Dark Psycho is really referencing the clique-o-vision

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:37.520
one.

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:38.520
Was the arcade version really different?

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:40.640
No, not really.

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:46.560
The clique-o-version, clique-o-vision, clique-o-vision one I think came out in 82?

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:47.720
Here's some from the arcade version.

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:50.680
I just noticed this related little video here, I just kind of want to take a peek and see

01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:51.680
how it's different.

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:55.720
Oh yeah, it's very similar looking, like almost like it's done on the same hardware or something.

01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:58.080
Except, you know, there's a little bit more animation.

01:07:58.080 --> 01:07:59.080
Yeah.

01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:03.880
Oh yeah, when you go in the rooms, it like zooms in.

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:04.880
Interesting.

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:08.360
But it had the same gameplay.

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:09.360
Yeah.

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:11.360
That's kind of interesting.

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:12.360
Oops, sorry.

01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:13.360
Alright.

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:17.480
But honestly, for me, it was all about, I mean, you know, the rooms are all the same.

01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:22.920
It's just, they zoom in and out, you know, but this was totally like my game.

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:23.920
Alright.

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:27.000
Venturi, oh this one has the corpses kind of rotting away.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Yeah.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.440
I mean, like I said, a little bit more animation, you know, but, oh and the snot monsters were

01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:33.440
red.

01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:36.360
But still, it's the same game.

01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:42.000
The clique-o-vision version is probably, for its time, the best translation of that game

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000
that there was.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Which came first?

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Venture or adventure?

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Because...

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000
I think venture came first.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Did it really?

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.720
I just, you know, my timeline from back then is not that great.

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:51.720
Let me check.

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:52.720
Let me check.

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:54.880
Yeah, look that up real quick, because I'm curious.

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:58.640
Because there are some similarities of sorts between the two, and I've seen comparisons

01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:00.800
to Berserk as well, because...

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:05.520
Yeah, it actually, the hall monsters are actually sort of like the evil Otto from Berserk.

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:08.600
Which is the bouncing happy face, if anyone's actually played that.

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:10.600
Good stuff.

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:13.040
Um, I can't find adventure.

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:14.040
Oh well.

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:17.440
Oh no, maybe actually spelling it right would be nice?

01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:20.000
That would help in trying to do your research.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Absolutely.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Yeah.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Okay.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:30.120
No, adventure was, uh, well there was a Sierra one in 1979.

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:31.120
So yeah.

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:32.120
Hmm.

01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:33.760
There's different games that were named adventure.

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:34.760
So.

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:35.760
Interesting.

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:39.800
Alright, well we're gonna take a quick break here at Orange Lounge Radio, but fear not,

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:42.080
we'll be back with more in tonight's Part B.

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:43.960
So stick around folks.

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:49.360
We'll be right back in just a minute with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:53.160
And for those of you guys listening live tonight, we're gonna take a quick music break here

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:56.640
in studio, and then we'll come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:01.120
We're just gonna do some potpourri here of some various, I think we'll do some Bamani

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:02.120
songs tonight.

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:03.120
Why not?

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:06.440
We'll be right back in just a moment here live at All Games Radio with Part B of Orange

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:07.440
Lounge Radio.

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:10.360
This is a chance for you to get up and stretch and all that good stuff.

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:16.720
We'll see you in a minute.

01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:21.320
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, February the 28th

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:22.320
of 2010.

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:24.920
So it's not a leap year, so it is the last day of February.

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:27.120
It's gonna be March all over again tomorrow.

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:29.440
Can't believe how fast the year is moving.

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:30.440
Yikes.

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:31.640
We're all getting old really quick.

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:35.840
Speaking of which, the song that we just played during break, now unfortunately the podcast

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:39.200
listeners can't hear it because you know the songs that we play during the break are copyrighted

01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:44.960
so we can only do it during the live streaming, but we played a remix by Mr. T, not the I

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:49.880
Pity the Foo kind from the A-Team, but Mr. T that did Bamani remixes back in the day

01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:52.280
from Popin' Music 10.

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:58.440
He did a remix of Goonies Are Good Enough from Goonies 2, which was also in the movie,

01:10:58.440 --> 01:10:59.440
the Cyndi Lauper song.

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:04.200
Now I can play a clip, so let me play a quick little clip for the benefit of the podcast

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:14.560
listeners.

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:15.560
It's good enough.

01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:16.560
Okay, yeah, right.

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:21.640
So I just was, and it was making me think that, God, I loved Goonies 2, the video game on

01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:22.640
the NES.

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:26.360
It was so like kind of like ahead of his time in some ways, but I was firing that up on

01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:29.960
the FC Mobile not that long ago because I actually have the cartridge of it and good

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:30.960
memories.

01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:32.120
That was such a great game.

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:35.820
Even though it really had nothing to do with the Goonies movie, it was still amazing.

01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:36.820
So F the Haters.

01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:37.820
There you go.

01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:42.520
Before we get into Twitter topics and some more gaming news tonight, I wanted to talk

01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:44.720
really quickly about something I watched this week.

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:48.920
And I don't know if you guys, I don't know if Loki or Dark Soccer has familiarized themselves

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:49.920
with this at all, but...

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:51.760
I know what it is, and therefore I avoided this.

01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:52.960
Okay, well here it is, here it is.

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:58.680
On the PlayStation Network this week, or I should say last week, they released The Tester,

01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:03.240
which is kind of a PlayStation Network exclusive show.

01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:07.120
It's kind of like an experimental thing because this is television essentially that was made

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:09.020
for the PlayStation Network.

01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:14.720
So it's a reality show, and I know we've reported on this on the show before, so I think most

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:18.320
of our listeners are already aware, it's this reality show where the prize is to become

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:21.440
a game tester for Sony Computer Entertainment.

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:22.440
That is the prize.

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:23.440
Sony Prize.

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:28.760
But one thing they also don't say very well, also a $5,000 signing bonus.

01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:31.320
So there is a cash prize that goes with it as well.

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:33.960
So there is at least just that.

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:36.320
You'll need it to offset the wages.

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:38.480
Well, I checked out the show.

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:44.880
Now if you guys don't already know, I am unapologetically a fan of reality game shows.

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:49.800
I don't necessarily mean all reality TV, but I loved Survivor back in the day.

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:53.360
I wanted to apply for Survivor actually way back in the day, but I didn't have a passport

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:54.840
or something, so I didn't do it.

01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:58.020
But I remember when they were casting for the first season of Survivor.

01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:00.760
But I just love old game shows, and I like the whole idea of a reality game show.

01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:01.760
I watched Big Brother.

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:04.360
I've done fan games online.

01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:08.360
I even like Project Runway, and my new favorite reality game show is RuPaul's Drag Race.

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:11.060
It's the most amazing show on television right now.

01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:15.040
What I don't like when they talk about reality shows, I don't like The Housewives of Orange

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:16.040
County.

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:17.440
I don't like The Hills.

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:19.520
And so I agree there's a lot of crap out there.

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:23.000
I kind of hate it when people say, I hate reality shows.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Reality game shows.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.340
Because that's like saying, I hate dramas, or I hate comedies.

01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:30.760
There's a lot of different types of reality shows, and some of them are very good.

01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:34.520
But of course, obviously, hearing about The Tester, I'm a little bit apprehensive about

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:36.760
this, but I'm like, okay, I'm a fan of reality shows.

01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:38.040
I'm a fan of video games.

01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:40.760
I need to check this show out and give it a fair shot.

01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:42.280
So I downloaded the show.

01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:44.140
It's about a 22-minute show.

01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:47.360
It's suitable for a 30-minute broadcast, basically with commercial breaks.

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:53.180
And I watched it, and it's not that bad.

01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:54.880
Are you surprised to hear me say that?

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:55.880
Nope.

01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:56.880
No.

01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:59.700
It's not terrible.

01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:01.720
It's a ridiculous concept.

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:05.600
I mean, I'm not going to get past the fact that we all know, if you've kind of had a

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:10.600
friend that works in the gaming industry, we all know the prize at the end of the day

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:11.600
is ridiculous.

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:14.120
But at least they throw a $5,000 signing bonus into it.

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:16.560
So at least there's that.

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:20.220
But I'm thinking to myself as I'm watching this, you know, this is basically a television

01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:22.000
show I'm watching on my PlayStation.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.080
The quality is great because it's in HDTV, and you can download it in HD, and it looks

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:32.360
better than most HD Comcast shows because I think most television comes out only at

01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:35.280
like 720, but this was like 1080 or whatever.

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:40.860
So the look of it was really good, and it was put together okay.

01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:43.920
The editing, you know, the editing was really tight because it's only a 22-minute show,

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:46.800
so you don't really get a lot of time to know the people.

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:49.220
But the editing was competent.

01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:52.760
The show was put together well enough.

01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:58.760
The biggest flaw about the show is that, again, the contest is so ridiculous to begin with

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:05.040
that basically the whole elimination and everything that they did was over this one minor challenge

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:10.440
that they did that the judges, who were two guys that worked for Sony and Hal Sparks,

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:15.160
which I don't know why Hal Sparks is a judge and not the host, but whatever.

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:20.040
I realize they need to have some type of celebrity draw, and, you know, I actually like Hal Sparks.

01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:25.000
I think he's great on The Soup back in the day when he was doing that stuff, and then

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.840
I Love the 90s and all those shows.

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:30.660
I think he's funny, and of course queer as folk, you know.

01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:35.600
So I think he's a good talent to have on there, although, you know, as a judge, eh, I think

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:39.040
he would have been a better host because they have some no-name girl doing the hosting,

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:43.440
you know, she's, what, a generic reality show host, whatever.

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:47.880
So I guess my biggest complaint is that the competition itself is a little weird.

01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:51.960
Like I kind of wish they had, like most reality game shows run an hour, even RuPaul's Drag

01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:56.560
Race is an hour, so that there is like a mini challenge, a mega challenge, and some time

01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.400
to understand what's going on.

01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:01.020
But I felt like the biggest flaw with the show is that it was just like, it was done

01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:06.440
so fast that you really didn't get a feel for why maybe one of them left.

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:10.440
I'll just spoil the first episode for you guys, two people leave in the first episode,

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:14.280
one of them you kind of see coming because they're very strange and awkward, but the

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:19.160
other one you're kind of like, I didn't really know anything about this person, so I can't

01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:21.840
feel bad that they got kicked off the show.

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:24.520
But here's the other thing I want to say about this, because I know a lot of people are saying

01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:27.720
like, what the hell, Rob, you actually like the show?

01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:30.880
I don't know if I'd go so far as to say like, I like it, I'm going to set a season pass

01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:31.880
on my TiVo.

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:37.800
I just think it was a competent show and quite honestly, it's better than about 90% of what's

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:38.800
on G4 television.

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:43.000
Here's my problem, the way I looked at it is when I heard that they're doing a reality

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:48.000
show where people are going to get to play games and stuff like that, that are first

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.320
looks at certain games, I saw that as, hey look, it's a 22 minute long commercial for

01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:54.880
Sony games, no thanks.

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:57.220
It wasn't that bad, it wasn't that in your face.

01:16:57.220 --> 01:17:02.520
They live in this bachelor pattish thing that is all these video games and you know of course

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:07.240
the guys like, sweet, Uncharted 2, some of that was a little ridiculous, but that's no

01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:10.180
worse than the judges drinking Coke at the American Idol's table.

01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:13.120
You expect there's going to be some of that product placement, but the challenge had nothing

01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:14.640
to do with the Sony game at all.

01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:17.960
And I thought actually the challenge that they played in this first episode, which was

01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:22.820
basically a glamorized version of can you spot the differences between the two pictures,

01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:28.640
I thought it actually played into the whole what you have to do to be a tester thing relatively

01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:29.640
well.

01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:30.640
What's that, Jamie?

01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:31.640
Nothing.

01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:32.640
I was talking about Shermie.

01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:33.640
Oh.

01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:34.640
Shermie just crapped.

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:35.640
Oh, did she?

01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:37.640
That was her review of the show.

01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:39.200
Nice.

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:42.020
But yeah, I mean they played it up okay.

01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:43.840
I mean I was expecting a lot worse.

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:49.140
The bar was very low, but I got a show that I would watch if I was flipping through TVs

01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:52.980
with nothing to watch and I stop on G4 TV and the show's on.

01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:55.880
It's better than most of the crap on that network right now.

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:59.280
That still just doesn't sound like enough to make me actually put any effort into watching

01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:00.280
TV.

01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:02.760
But yeah, you don't, I wouldn't recommend the show for you, Jamie, I don't think you'd

01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:03.760
like it.

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:12.480
Well, you know, I watch three shows with any variety of regularity, Supernatural, Doctor

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:17.800
Who, and let me get back to it.

01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:18.800
Oh, BBC News.

01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:19.800
Oh, okay.

01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:20.800
You know what?

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:21.800
What?

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:24.780
I was gonna say though, Jamie, I would recommend, however, you watch RuPaul's Drag Race because

01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:25.960
it's amazing.

01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:27.280
And may the best woman win.

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:28.640
I love drag queens so much.

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:30.960
You know what would be so awesome?

01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:31.960
Me too.

01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:32.960
What?

01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:33.960
On Xbox Live.

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:34.960
Huh.

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:38.720
Now that they're gonna have the Microsoft Game Room thing.

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:39.720
Yeah.

01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:41.400
To bring back Starrcade.

01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:42.400
Seriously.

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:47.180
But, you know, you gotta think though, this is, sure this show is a little eh, but it

01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:50.960
could be setting the stage for something even greater in the future.

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:55.940
Like, you know, it's kind of interesting that, wow, Sony put all this together, who else

01:18:55.940 --> 01:19:00.560
might deliver their show exclusively on PlayStation Network or Xbox Live Arcade?

01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:02.720
And yeah, I'm all for Starrcade coming back.

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:04.400
Or some type of old school game show.

01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:08.760
Like, you know, like 1 vs 100, but Starrcade, where you play the games that they're playing

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:10.880
during the show and stuff like that.

01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:12.300
That is a great idea.

01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:13.300
I would love to see that.

01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:16.080
To answer Tigerclaw, I wasn't impressed enough with the first episode of V to give it any

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:17.940
more thought.

01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:21.280
And for the listeners that don't know what Darkstar is talking about, Tigerclaw said,

01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:22.280
V next month.

01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:25.280
You gotta watch V. So there you go.

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:29.520
Oh, Shermie took a duty in the hallway.

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:33.000
That's no good.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:40.600
And that's what she thinks of the tester.

01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:45.840
A shit with no effort.

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:49.920
I can't believe the cat just took a dump on the floor in the middle of the show.

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:55.640
Dump where dump should not be on the PlayStation Network.

01:19:55.640 --> 01:20:01.760
Which cat, when forced to watch the tester, takes a crap first?

01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:10.000
No, to explain, Shermie is an old lady.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.000
She's up there now in cat ears and is not in...

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.920
So she just didn't make it to the litter box or what?

01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:16.920
I have no idea.

01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:17.920
I'm trying to figure out what's wrong.

01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:19.960
I'm going to take her to the vet probably after payday.

01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:20.960
I hope she's okay.

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:23.240
Yeah, she's just been...

01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:24.240
And anytime she...

01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:25.960
Well, no, I just...

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:29.120
Maybe she doesn't like her litter because she does that when she doesn't like her litter

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:30.120
either.

01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:32.000
Even though it's the same litter I've been using for a while.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.000
I think it was just a response.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.280
Well, props to her at least going towards the bathroom.

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:36.280
I know.

01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:37.960
At least she didn't do it on the mixing board.

01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:39.500
No, no, no.

01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:41.880
She will do it either.

01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:46.000
When she decides to poop somewhere that is not her box, she will either do it on one

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.840
of the bathroom rugs right in front of the bathroom or on one of the kitchen rugs.

01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:54.800
She does not do it so much on one of the kitchen rugs because I yelled at her.

01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:57.920
She at least does it where it can be easily cleaned up.

01:20:57.920 --> 01:20:59.320
I think she's making a statement.

01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:03.840
I think she's like, mom, you should quit your job and pay attention to me 24 seven.

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:04.840
She cats it all the time.

01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:09.440
All right, let's stop talking about poop and talk about game news.

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:13.880
She says the show is good for me to poop on.

01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:15.200
Clearly.

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:17.520
How about some rapid fire news, Loki?

01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:18.520
All right.

01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:21.120
Well, um, there's actually this is real quick.

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:22.120
Sorry.

01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:23.120
Get your tweets in.

01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:26.800
I don't think I mentioned it before in the show, but if you have some tweets for tonight's

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:30.360
Twitter topics, get those in now, now, now, um, this is kind of interesting.

01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:36.280
Super Meat Boy is coming to Xbox Live Arcade and actually before the WiiWare version, which,

01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:39.520
you know, I didn't even realize there was an Xbox Live Arcade version, and now it's

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:43.600
coming out before it is scheduled to be coming out this summer.

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:44.760
And that's pretty cool.

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:49.120
And for those who don't know, Super Meat Boy is a platform action game starring a little

01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:53.760
character that's made out of meat and you splatter around the screen and that's all

01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:55.760
fun.

01:21:55.760 --> 01:22:01.800
Then, of course, there's going to be a tie in game with the new movie Kick Ass that is

01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:05.400
coming to PlayStation three and the iPhone.

01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:11.240
And of course, this game kind of reminds me a little bit of the Watchmen The End is Nigh,

01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:16.320
which I think did a little bit better on the PS3, probably because the Blu-ray was bundled

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:19.000
with the game when it came out retail.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:25.160
But the PS3 game will have Facebook integration as well.

01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:28.480
And I don't know.

01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:30.640
Game looks just OK.

01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:34.800
It looks just like a beat-em-up action game, just like the Watchmen one.

01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:39.760
The movie, though, on the other hand, is pretty awesome and it's kind of, you know, what happens

01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:43.640
when kids decide to become superheroes, but they don't have superpowers.

01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:46.000
They just fight crime.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.760
It's got Nicolas Cage acting weird.

01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:54.560
And then on the PlayStation Network, the version of Castle Crashers is getting a brand new

01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:56.320
addition.

01:22:56.320 --> 01:23:03.000
Extreme Volleyball Action is coming to the PlayStation three version of Castle Crashers.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:10.160
Apparently they're including a cooperative and competitive volleyball game with online

01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:16.320
or offline play, and Magic Attacks apparently will be directly applied to your ball as well

01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:22.720
as there's going to be some leaderboards, spiking moves, and some other stuff.

01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:26.720
And this is coming from the Behemoth development blog.

01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:32.320
Sorry, Jamie's having the great Lysol race in the hallway right now.

01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:34.200
It's a good thing I can't smell anything.

01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:35.880
Oh, that's right, you're congesting.

01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:36.880
I can't smell a thing.

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:37.880
I was just being polite.

01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:40.160
I didn't want to sit here and go, Jamie, your house smells like poop.

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:44.320
Well, no, I just smelled it because fucking Shermie.

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:45.760
She just needs, she just needs a...

01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:50.920
I was like, I don't know, maybe all this talk about the tester made Jamie crap her pants.

01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:51.920
I don't know.

01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:52.920
I don't want to be rude.

01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:53.920
No.

01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:55.760
It's Shermie shit in the hall.

01:23:55.760 --> 01:24:00.520
At least go in the tub.

01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:03.480
I was, that was a reference to last week's show, you see what I did there?

01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:04.480
All right.

01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:05.480
Sorry, Loki.

01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:07.160
Do you have anything else you want to share?

01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:08.160
That's it.

01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:09.160
All right.

01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:10.160
I got some quick stories for you guys.

01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:11.560
Actually, I did check out this game.

01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:14.520
I didn't mention it during my gaming week, but this is something I did check out this

01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:16.120
week and that was Missile Command.

01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:19.440
It's a brand new version of Missile Command from Atari.

01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:22.360
It's free to play and it's on the web and it's like a co-op.

01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:25.560
It's actually a multiplayer thing by developer OMG Pop.

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:30.000
That doesn't sound like another developer I know that does a lot of casual web games

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.360
at all, but yeah, it's a whole like new souped up version of Missile Command and it's, it

01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:35.360
was okay.

01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:36.360
It was cute.

01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:37.360
It was fun.

01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:41.480
It wasn't really that much like the original to me, but no word yet if Mr. Awesome is on

01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:46.680
and playing or what's going on, but you can check that out at Atari.com slash Missile

01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:47.680
Command.

01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:48.680
It's free.

01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:49.680
Can't complain about free.

01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:54.000
Well, I had no idea that they were trying to do this game, but apparently they are.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.800
They're making a game out of Grease.

01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:58.940
Yes, the play Grease.

01:24:58.940 --> 01:25:02.040
You know, tell me more.

01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:03.040
Tell me more.

01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:04.040
Yes.

01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:07.860
Uh, apparently, uh, yeah, they're making a video game version of this five Oh five games

01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:09.440
actually is the people that were making it.

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:10.440
I'm not surprised.

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:16.640
They have actually found, uh, a, I guess a, a publisher for it or five Oh five games is

01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:17.640
the publisher.

01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:18.640
I think I'm sorry.

01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:21.320
Yeah, they are the publisher who's, who's developing a big head games.

01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:27.480
Uh, they did chime on the Xbox live that was a recent, no word as to like what the game

01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:28.920
is at all.

01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:30.760
How would you make a game out of Grease?

01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:33.140
Like a karaoke game or it's going to be awful.

01:25:33.140 --> 01:25:35.520
It's just like, Hey look, we bought the rights to something.

01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:36.520
Yay.

01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:37.520
Let's make a game out of it.

01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:44.120
You know, not them, but like other companies, you know, they'll buy rights for like stupid

01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:45.120
shit.

01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:48.840
Like the smile, you know, like the smiley face shirts, smiley.

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:49.840
Yeah.

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:51.920
There is a company that bought the rights for that made a game out of it.

01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:53.600
No one remembers it because it sucked.

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:58.320
I remember a face ball 2000 that had the big smiley's have a nice day.

01:25:58.320 --> 01:25:59.320
Exactly.

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:01.040
But that game was actually kind of fun.

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:08.360
Um, or for example, um, the jelly belly, they have like a jelly belly game cause they licensed

01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:12.320
that cause the license was really cheap or yummy or M and M's.

01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:15.080
They made some M and M game racing game.

01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:16.080
That was pretty terrible.

01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:17.080
Huh?

01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:18.080
Well, yeah.

01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:21.600
Yo, no, it was cool, but that was like way back in the eighties when people knew what

01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:26.080
the hell the noise kids and annoyed supposed to be making a comeback.

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:29.560
It was supposed to be, look, how about a computer game?

01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:30.560
Everybody wants to play.

01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:32.720
There's tons and tons of people want to play this star craft too.

01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:34.680
And of course the beta is going on right now.

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:39.200
Uh, apparently due to the number of Blizzcon attendees, not everybody who is at Blizzcon

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:44.200
is yet in the beta, but in the next couple of weeks after this first wave, uh, supposedly

01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:47.440
all the Blizzcon attendees are going to be included in a future wave.

01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:49.560
It's supposed to be happening in the next couple of weeks.

01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:52.640
So it might be as soon as the time you guys actually hear this podcast.

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:54.120
So you might want to follow up on that.

01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:57.880
If you were a Blizzcon attendee, you could be playing a star craft too right now, or

01:26:57.880 --> 01:26:59.000
very soon at least.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:00.360
Dark Sakura.

01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:03.200
Well, um, this is pretty happy stuff.

01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:08.600
Um, there are, uh, for a pre-order bonus for super street fighter four, there's a classic

01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:10.480
costume pack.

01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:15.080
And so, um, they are for Blanca, Guile, Gen, Feilong and Dalsim.

01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:22.280
Um, for Feilong he gets a kind of a, uh, Kato costume.

01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:23.280
And Blanca- I love Feilong.

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:24.280
Just saying.

01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:26.440
Blanca gets Dan's Gui.

01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:32.160
Which if you, uh, and this goes back to actually, um, Street Fighter Alpha 3, did you ever beat

01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:33.160
Street Fighter Alpha 3?

01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:35.400
I don't think I ever played Street Fighter Alpha 3.

01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:38.880
It was kind of during that period when I wasn't playing a lot of games heavy.

01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:42.320
One of the endings, Dan and Blanca are just hanging out.

01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:45.560
And Blanca can- no, Dan can understand all of Blanca's grunts.

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:49.920
So he's like, I see you, my friend, let's go out and play.

01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:50.920
Rolling and rolling.

01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:52.840
And it has the two of them rolling across the screen, that's where I get the rolling

01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:53.840
and rolling from.

01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:56.400
So yeah, he's wearing a Dansky.

01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:59.160
Um, then- Are they like gay lovers or something?

01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:00.160
Or is it just- I don't think so.

01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:01.160
Okay.

01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:02.160
They're just BFFs.

01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:03.160
They're BFFs.

01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:04.560
It's Jay and Silent Bob.

01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:08.640
Um, and then Gen has a- Heterosexual life partners.

01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:09.640
Yeah.

01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:10.640
Gen is shirtless.

01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:14.240
Um, Guile is wearing a ballistic vest.

01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:18.760
He's just all kinds of, you know, hardcore ops guy.

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:28.720
And Dhalsim is wearing, um, a, uh, I guess just more traditional, um, dress for India.

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:30.720
There you go.

01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:31.720
Very snazzy.

01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:38.680
He looks like- Who is that fighter in, um, um, Mike Tyson's Punch Out where the little

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:43.120
ruby in his turban would flash, and that's how you knew he was about to throw a punch.

01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:45.240
What was that guy's name in Mike Tyson's Punch Out?

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:47.480
I don't remember, but this totally- Because that's what Dhalsim looks like right

01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:48.480
there.

01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:49.480
I'm gonna link the picture in the chat room.

01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:50.480
All right.

01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:52.000
Somebody, somebody in chat will, uh, yell it out there.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Ah, it's Tiger something.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.000
I don't remember.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Yeah.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:00.600
Uh, Shaoran in chat, by the way, says bromance would be the term for, uh, what Dan and Blanca

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:02.120
have going on there.

01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:07.000
And Dark Tetsuya says, now I have an image of Dan saying snooch to the nooch.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:12.600
You know, there's actually, um, it's funny that the term bromance, there actually is,

01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:15.200
um, a term called romantic friendship.

01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:16.600
Have you ever heard of that?

01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:18.280
I think I have, yeah.

01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:19.920
And I thought that was funny.

01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:23.160
Uh, Dark Tetsuya says Great Tiger was the name of that fighter.

01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:24.160
Sounds right.

01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:26.340
I think he's right.

01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:29.240
That's why I love having a live audience, because when I don't know the answer to something,

01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:31.000
I'll just go chat, help, and they do.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.000
It's great.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:37.480
And Akdefta is wondering if they're starting a bad bromance, rah, rah.

01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:38.480
You know what?

01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:46.720
I freaking have to listen to that song now after, you know, me really loathing Lady whatever,

01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:49.000
because you cannot resist the power of Lady Gaga.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.000
She's she's amazing.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.120
I don't really like any of her other stuff, by the way.

01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:53.120
It's just that one.

01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:54.360
I actually kind of like, okay.

01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:55.360
Nobody's perfect.

01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:56.360
You'll come around.

01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:57.360
I know.

01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:58.360
I know.

01:29:58.360 --> 01:29:59.360
She'll eventually become perfect like me.

01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:06.320
Okay, topic time, www.Twitter.com slash O L R. Show us your tweets every week and we'll

01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:08.520
read some of our favorites here on the program.

01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:12.340
Of course, we can't read everything, but there's some really good questions tonight, so I want

01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:13.340
to get to this.

01:30:13.340 --> 01:30:15.120
Um, let's see.

01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:17.800
Nut Man wants to know if the podcast will be uploaded tomorrow.

01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:18.800
Pretty please.

01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:19.800
It should be.

01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:22.680
Uh, there shouldn't be a delay at all this week, although I got to say I had last week's

01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:26.360
show up Monday night, but I should, I've been getting pretty good this year about getting

01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:27.980
the show up within 24 hours.

01:30:27.980 --> 01:30:29.900
So I'm going to try and continue that trend.

01:30:29.900 --> 01:30:35.060
Knock on wood, um, at depth links us to a story that harmonics might not actually be

01:30:35.060 --> 01:30:37.220
working on rock band three right now.

01:30:37.220 --> 01:30:39.680
There may actually be something else going on right now.

01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:44.960
Um, I guess, uh, this is a new story he's linked us to from rock band aid.com.

01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:48.740
Uh, I guess, let's see what's going on here.

01:30:48.740 --> 01:30:52.180
There's a Twitter from some guy, I guess, at harmonics harmonics.

01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:55.760
The creators of the rock band video game is planning on using one of my tracks for their

01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:56.760
demo projects.

01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:57.760
Awesome.

01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:03.040
This is some, uh, other guy and I guess harmonics recently licensed hip hop and dance songs

01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:04.880
kind of putting it all together.

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:09.440
And so now maybe there might be a new frequency or amplitude game is kind of the rumor that's

01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:11.860
going on right now, which would make a lot of sense.

01:31:11.860 --> 01:31:14.400
You know, frequency and amplitude kind of came out when not a lot of people knew who

01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:18.000
harmonics was and they were more experimental games, but they were great games.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.760
And I think if they are going to, you know, now that more people know what rock band is,

01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:25.880
if they're going to kind of come out with a, I don't know what would they call a game

01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:32.120
around dance music and stuff that's in that frequency, amplitude, vein, I don't know frequency

01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:37.000
frequency to freak, who knows, Apple and CJ hero.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.560
Oh wait, no, we'll see.

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:43.480
Uh, Salvex seven sends us a variety of tweets here on one subject.

01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:44.480
Let me read these.

01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:47.000
It's a little longer than 140, 40 characters, but it's okay.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Does it like the question here?

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.240
Salvex seven on Twitter.

01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:54.080
Hey guys, I have an interesting question for you historically, which generation of gaming

01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:58.160
would you classify as the most contra country that got cut off?

01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:03.760
I'm assuming contributive to society's development regarding to the social interaction, the fun

01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:07.140
element escape from one's reality and moral values.

01:32:07.140 --> 01:32:10.560
I know it's complex, but if you could answer it, I would appreciate it.

01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:11.560
Take care guys.

01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:12.560
Have a nice one.

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:13.600
What do you guys think?

01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:22.000
What generation of gaming would classify as the most contributive to society's development?

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.000
That's a tough question.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:28.960
What just the development of society as in, and he goes on to specify as in, uh, the social

01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:34.640
interaction, the fun element, the escape from one's reality and moral, moral values, pong

01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:36.000
haul the way back to old school.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Where would we be?

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:40.400
I mean, where would the industry be if someone didn't invent pong, the zeroth generation?

01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:44.520
Yeah, I'd say like the arcade age or something like that.

01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:50.520
Maybe even like just the, not necessarily the eight bit generation, but like, um, you

01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:55.800
know, even before that probably the four bit generation, you know, the Tari, Coleco, Odyssey,

01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:56.800
that kind of stuff.

01:32:56.800 --> 01:33:00.160
Well, I think in gaming it'd be the day that we got on the radio.

01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:01.160
Nice answer.

01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:02.720
Uh, I would have two answers for this question.

01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:05.640
I would say, I think it's the fourth generation of gaming.

01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:08.940
The one that involved the NES, the, when the Nintendo entertainment system first came to

01:33:08.940 --> 01:33:13.660
America because it came out at a time when video games were pretty much declared dead

01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:16.720
and dying and nobody is interested in video games anymore.

01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:21.280
You know, after the great video game crash of 84, 83, whatever you want to pay it as.

01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:25.040
And then, um, the NES comes out and the NES does very well.

01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:30.720
And who in the, in our generation, you know, where our lower thirties, upper twenties,

01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:34.760
who in our generation does not know super Mario brothers or link from Zelda.

01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:39.680
Like who in this generation does not know that from your country, even people that don't

01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:43.880
do nerdy gaming podcasts every week or listen to them, they know who Mario and Luigi are.

01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:45.120
You know, those characters.

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:48.480
I think it was really the first generation to create a character.

01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:53.480
I don't think everybody on the street knows who Pitfall Harry, or maybe some of the, well,

01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:54.480
maybe Pac-Man.

01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:57.880
I mean, that came from the generation before, but I think, I don't know, something about

01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:01.760
really bringing it into the homes and so forth with these really memorable characters.

01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:07.240
I think that was really the generation that did have a song written about him and Mario

01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:10.040
really didn't other than do the Mario.

01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:14.360
Um, but then the, my other answer to the question would be the current one.

01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:18.240
The current generation of gaming, I think is huge to society because for a variety of

01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:24.160
reasons, a, the, we has, you know, as much as we love to hate on it for, you know, what

01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:28.280
it is sometimes here on this show, there's no denying that it has penetrated society

01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:30.720
in a way that most video game systems have not.

01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:36.280
We sports is like such a typical video game.

01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:38.400
It's like not even like a video game to a lot of people.

01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:44.280
We sports is a, it's a, it's like, you know, it's an activity simulation.

01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:46.800
People don't say, let's come over and play video games and say, let's come over and play

01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:50.120
we sports or, you know, the, we, you know, it's, it's just so interesting.

01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:55.200
And then on the other hand, you have Xbox live, you know, really kind of in a way almost

01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:58.800
killing arcades because people are able to communicate over the internet and talk while

01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:01.800
they're playing games and develop this whole community.

01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:05.840
And then, you know, some, somewhat the PlayStation three in this as well, but then now that video

01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:08.640
games are not just about video games, but they're entertainment boxes.

01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:13.960
There are these, you know, sets in our living room that do everything that now that they're,

01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:16.120
that they're getting their own TV shows for heaven's sakes.

01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:20.400
I mean, I think this current one is, is shaping things up in, in a huge way.

01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:21.400
That's going to continue.

01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:25.320
Certainly it's, they're setting it up to have a longer lifespan than the generations before

01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:26.320
it.

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:27.320
So we'll see.

01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:30.680
Keep in mind the networking side of it and the web play side of this.

01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:35.160
Remember back, remember we had the X link back in the day.

01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:37.920
We had, well in Japan they had Satellaview.

01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:40.440
So it's not a new concept.

01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:41.920
It's a perfected concept.

01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:46.320
But it's, it's now, it's penetrate, excuse me, it's penetrated the marketplace and had

01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:49.480
its effect on society that Satellaview didn't, nobody remembers Satellaview.

01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:54.520
What was a novel concept then is, and actually I didn't even have to say one of the biggest

01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:59.960
games that came out that really brought that on was Phantasy Star Online, if you think

01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:00.960
about it.

01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:04.600
Cause you could get on and chat with your friends and it was on a console that you could

01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:06.640
do this back onto the Dreamcast.

01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:07.680
So I mean that was a big thing.

01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:12.360
But unfortunately it wasn't until you had like World of Warcraft perfected the MMO in

01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:13.360
some ways.

01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:14.920
I guess you get to give some of that to EverQuest as well.

01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:18.000
Then again, Ragnarok Online was my big crack.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.760
But again, society, most people know Warcraft.

01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:22.760
I'd really say maybe it's the advent of the MMO.

01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:27.600
But you see, you know, and I'm really trying to take that question as literal as possible

01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:28.880
is what's the biggest impact on society?

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:32.800
Cause if you ask what's my favorite, well the Super Nintendo was my favorite console

01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:33.800
in that whole generation.

01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:35.480
Nintendo versus Sega and Turbo Graphics.

01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:38.680
I mean that was like right when I was in high school and kind of growing up, I remember

01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:39.680
all that stuff.

01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:42.280
So that was, that was my favorite generation.

01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:45.560
But I don't think it necessarily had the biggest impact on society.

01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:47.200
I think that was more of a bridge.

01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:49.280
Video games were still a niche thing back then.

01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:53.720
It did create though a good deal of initial rivalry and discussion because back, you know,

01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:55.760
for a long time it was like, oh well you have an Atari.

01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:57.180
Oh now you have a ColecoVision.

01:36:57.180 --> 01:37:00.480
There wasn't really a big contest between many of the systems.

01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:03.120
Because really what was coming out was one upping the other.

01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:06.160
Until you start getting, you know, actual competition going.

01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:09.600
Like it's funny, you know, I grew up with my Super Nintendo with my Nintendo.

01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:13.320
Dan grew up with Master System and Genesis.

01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:14.320
You know.

01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:15.320
So I bring the Nintendo love.

01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:16.480
He brings the Sega love.

01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:20.880
Of course I've developed my Sega love, you know, after I, you know, got to sit down and

01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:22.640
play the Saturn for a long, long time.

01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:27.160
But it's, it's an evolution.

01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:32.800
It really just, I think that's why I want to go back very far back to the, to Pinball

01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:34.960
Rob to Pinball.

01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:38.960
Some comments from our chat room, chat.orangelaunchradio.com, live on this Sunday night as we tape at

01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:39.960
All Games Radio.

01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:45.800
Gia, I'm sorry, Sharan says, World of Warcraft just standardized both the best and worst

01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:47.040
of MMO tropes.

01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:50.600
Again, it's not necessarily about inventing a concept, it's about perfecting it.

01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:53.400
I think is an important point that was brought up.

01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:55.080
Anyway, that was a great question.

01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:57.760
So I'm going to give an honorary gold star to Salvax.

01:37:57.760 --> 01:37:58.960
He gets a Twitter gold star.

01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:01.900
I don't think we've given any of those out, but that was one of my favorite Twitter questions

01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:03.040
we've gotten ever.

01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:05.280
So gold star for you.

01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:08.720
Robocoon wants to clue us in on a Steam UI update.

01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:10.720
It's a beta thing that you can opt into, and that's good.

01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:14.160
I think Steam could use a little bit of a facelift.

01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:17.540
I'm not, I haven't read this story as familiar as myself with it in advance, but apparently

01:38:17.540 --> 01:38:23.400
you can take part in the beta by going into Steam's website in the settings link and then

01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:27.060
selecting the 2010 UI update under beta participation.

01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:29.760
But I'm looking at these screenshots and I got to say one thing that does kind of worry

01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:34.880
me as I'm noticing in one of these screenshots, there's like a list that shows community activity

01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:37.880
and it shows what games your friends are buying.

01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:40.560
I don't know if I want that data like out there and published.

01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:43.960
Like I don't want my friends knowing that I just bought the amazing unicorn game.

01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:47.080
You know, I'm hoping there's a way to suppress that.

01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:49.080
Imagine fairies.

01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:51.800
I'm sure there is a way to suppress that.

01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:55.760
But there is, there's some unicorn game that's out there on Steam and my boyfriend's been

01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:58.600
tempting me with this saying, you know you want this game, you know you want this game.

01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:02.080
When obviously it looks like such crap, but it's kind of one of those things like I want

01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:04.020
to like buy it for you as a gift.

01:39:04.020 --> 01:39:06.760
So you're obligated to play it and then you have to talk about it on next week.

01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:08.400
So LR during how was your gaming week?

01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:11.520
Like I think we actually have conversation.

01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:13.520
Are you pulling it up right now or what?

01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:14.520
Sure.

01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:15.520
I'm going on my Steam.

01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:18.160
Look, look for the unicorn game or I'm going to get a text message in a minute.

01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:21.560
That'll tell me what it is, but magical unicorn game.

01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:23.320
It's something about magical unicorns.

01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:24.320
There's an awesome.

01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:25.320
Okay.

01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:30.040
It's not even God, here we go, no, no, no, no, no, no, no tangent train, no, no, no,

01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:31.040
no.

01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:32.040
Tangent train.

01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:36.640
This is actually, there's another magical unicorn game that's on, no, don't get me wrong.

01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:40.720
It's a commercial for this cause I watch Cartoon Network and Adult Swim sometimes.

01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:42.280
They have a new game on their website.

01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:44.480
Oh yeah, the farting unicorn rainbow game.

01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:45.480
I played that.

01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:49.400
I don't know about farting unicorn game, but it's just this unicorn that's jumping in the

01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:54.520
commercial and running around and stuff with the, with, I forget what music it, it set

01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:58.160
this on like eighties rock band music or something.

01:39:58.160 --> 01:39:59.160
I got to find that.

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:00.160
I've played this.

01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:01.160
I have played this.

01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:06.120
The chat room is urging us to check the hallway to make sure Shirmi hasn't taken another crap

01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:09.720
on this topic.

01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:10.720
Do you smell shit?

01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:12.120
I don't think so.

01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:17.960
All right, well, while you're looking that up, let me get a couple of these other tweets

01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:19.800
out of the way here at our Twitter.

01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:25.240
Um, MNZeba sends us a Twitter, it says new copy protection technology outrages gamers.

01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:27.480
Not sure if this is already said, and this is the link.

01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:29.140
I believe this is talking about Ubisoft.

01:40:29.140 --> 01:40:31.040
So yeah, we have brought this up on a previous episode.

01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:34.840
It was brought up a couple of weeks ago, but I think this is still worth sharing.

01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:38.840
So thank you for the tweet because now it's penetrated like Yahoo and it's starting to

01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:41.800
get onto the mainstream sites about this copy protection.

01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:45.840
It's a robot unicorn attack is what the game's called.

01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:50.560
It's it's secret of the magic crystals. Rob is the one that you're looking for.

01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:51.600
Is that it?

01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:53.440
It's also gone down to $6.99.

01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:54.440
I think.

01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:55.440
Oh, wow.

01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:56.440
That's a bargain.

01:40:56.440 --> 01:40:57.440
Hold on.

01:40:57.440 --> 01:40:58.440
I just got a text message.

01:40:58.440 --> 01:40:59.440
Hold on.

01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:00.440
I'm firing up my phone.

01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:04.280
And the screenshot where you do crafting with a magic material called anus.

01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:05.280
That's right.

01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:09.440
When one of the screenshots, there's a magical crafting, I don't know if it deleted his first

01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:12.360
text where he told me the name of the game, but yeah, that's the game.

01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:13.360
What is it?

01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:15.880
What is it again?

01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:18.440
I just found the name, the secret of the magic crystals.

01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:19.720
Yes, that's it.

01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:20.720
It's a game about unicorns.

01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:24.440
And in one of those screens, if you look at one of the screenshots, okay, look there,

01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:29.960
there, there's a crafting material on that screen called anus.

01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:34.400
If you look at it, one of the, like you have to collect anus, but it's A-E-N-U-S.

01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:39.600
A-E-N-U-S. Yeah, there it is.

01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:40.600
As pink.

01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:48.320
You have to collect all the pink anus you can.

01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:50.480
You know you want that game.

01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:52.640
Fuck it.

01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:53.640
Add to cart.

01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:54.640
Reverse.

01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:55.640
Did you really?

01:41:55.640 --> 01:41:56.640
Are you buying the game?

01:41:56.640 --> 01:41:57.760
I'm buying it.

01:41:57.760 --> 01:41:59.760
Right now I'm buying it for seven bucks.

01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:00.760
Congratulations, Alan.

01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:01.760
Good job.

01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:02.760
All right.

01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:08.440
And I will have a full review of the gay unicorn game complete with anus and horn.

01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:09.440
All right.

01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:12.240
I don't know how the anus crafting goes a little later.

01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:18.280
This might need to be our next, um, uh, cause here on the show that, that we yell and scream

01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:21.960
for everybody to tweet and Facebook about is to get this on the consoles because I want

01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:24.760
some pink anus on my Xbox 360.

01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:29.960
This game, apparently the robot unicorn attack or whatever has a really interesting song

01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:34.880
that plays in the background, although I haven't played it yet, but on the commercial it sounded

01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:35.880
funny.

01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:38.080
It's, uh, the chat room is, uh, it's erasure always.

01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:45.280
Cause I, in fact, I actually made a live journal post on this like a while back.

01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:50.680
No, I posted it on Twitter.

01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:51.680
Hold on.

01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:54.200
Here's, here's a little bit, just so, just so you have something to reference here.

01:42:54.200 --> 01:43:05.800
Loki is the actual, oh yeah, that's actually one of my favorite erasure songs.

01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:08.440
Erasure is a great synthball fan.

01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:11.440
I love that one too.

01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:12.440
Yeah.

01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:20.200
This is, you play this game to unicorns, to unicorns running and farting rainbows.

01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:27.640
Here we go, Rob, let's see here.

01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:30.280
Well now Loki's Loki's fired this up in studio.

01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:31.280
What is this?

01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:32.280
Is this a flash game?

01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:33.280
Yeah.

01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:45.320
Oh my gosh, your unicorn was all twisted in a big pile up in the ground.

01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:46.760
Can you post this link in chat please?

01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:47.760
This is so awesome.

01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:49.160
Can you post this link in chat?

01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:50.160
Yeah.

01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:51.760
Okay, thank you.

01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:52.760
Maybe put it on the Twitter.

01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:55.680
Can you post it to the Twitter that we're talking about it on the show right now?

01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:57.120
You know the password and all that.

01:43:57.120 --> 01:43:58.120
All right.

01:43:58.120 --> 01:43:59.120
Please post that to the Twitter.

01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:00.920
That's why I just downloaded the song.

01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:01.920
Yeah.

01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:02.920
Thank you.

01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:03.920
Thank you.

01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:04.920
Thank you, Dark Tetsuya.

01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:05.920
Orange Tansit Radio.

01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:06.920
Oh yeah.

01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:10.640
So the original tweet had to do with copy protection from Ubisoft.

01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:11.640
Yeah.

01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:14.520
Now it's in the mainstream press and I was just going to say that it's interesting that

01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:19.360
now, you know, that digital copyright stuff has been screwed up so bad it's in the mainstream

01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:20.360
press.

01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:23.920
30 minutes into part B and we're still on Twitter topics, just FYI.

01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:32.080
And then lastly, a tweet from Alex P Carson wanting us to give a shout out to Alex Nicole.

01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:33.520
It's her first time listening.

01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:35.040
Shout out.

01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:36.560
Shout out.

01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:39.200
Hopefully she didn't turn it off after the farting rainbows chat.

01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:41.360
I hope we didn't scare her off.

01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:42.360
All right.

01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:45.400
Anyhow, and Amazed Shitsuma in chat.

01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:46.400
Yes, he changed his name.

01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:51.000
Amazed Shitsuma says Orange Lounge Unicornio is the new name of the show apparently.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:52.880
Who doesn't love unicorns?

01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:54.280
Like evil people.

01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:55.280
All right.

01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:58.380
Anyhow, Loki, I hate to interrupt you because I know you're running to the Twitter right

01:44:58.380 --> 01:45:04.680
now to post, but Loki, can you give us some more gaming news here on OPLR?

01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:08.680
It was very distracting, but that game was awesome.

01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:15.880
Anyways, so there's some cool stuff coming to Final Fantasy 11, believe it or not.

01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:21.680
They just announced that three new battle arenas are coming to Final Fantasy 11.

01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:28.920
And those, of course, have to do, I guess, with Abyssia, and it's going to have, let's

01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:33.940
see here, Vision of Abyssia, I guess will come out during the summer, with the other

01:45:33.940 --> 01:45:38.800
two Scars of Abyssia and Heroes of Abyssia coming soon after that.

01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:44.600
And each new area can be purchased for $10 on the Play Online viewer.

01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:47.240
I'm surprised that there's still expansions coming out to this.

01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:49.980
I'm not really sure what these new battle arenas are.

01:45:49.980 --> 01:45:53.560
I mean, this is something that was added way after I left, so.

01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:57.320
I totally realized that I never finished my other Twitter topics.

01:45:57.320 --> 01:45:58.320
You never what?

01:45:58.320 --> 01:45:59.320
Not my Twitter topics.

01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:00.320
They're rapid fire.

01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:01.320
Well, then we'll come back to it in a moment here.

01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:02.320
It's fine.

01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:03.320
That's all right.

01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:10.180
But quickly, I wanted to say about Final Fantasy 11 and its developments and what have you,

01:46:10.180 --> 01:46:13.640
this should kind of squelch those rumors that Final Fantasy 11's shutting down in a couple

01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:17.800
months to make room for 14, which I always thought was a little bit ridiculous, how fast

01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:19.240
that spread like wildfire.

01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:26.960
But this I'm sure is in part to shut up those rumors that 11 is still being supported.

01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:29.200
You're not going to fit in there, Shirmi.

01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:30.200
What's Shirmi trying?

01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:31.200
Oh, Shirmi's trying to...

01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:33.080
She's trying to poop on the mixing board.

01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:34.080
It's not working.

01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:35.080
She's trying.

01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:36.080
End the show.

01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:37.080
End the show.

01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:38.080
All right.

01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:41.120
You got a little more for us, Logi?

01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:42.120
Yes.

01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:47.000
Also, Final Fantasy 14 will be going into closed beta soon, actually.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:59.560
Starting March 11th, and I believe that they did have the VanaFest, I guess, the 2010 website,

01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:00.560
which was some...

01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:04.000
They had some news, I guess, about Final Fantasy 11 as well.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:11.680
But on the Play Online website, there's also interesting news, I guess, that the betas

01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:15.220
will start on March 11th, and I think I've already signed up for this.

01:47:15.220 --> 01:47:16.640
I want to say I've already signed up for the beta.

01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:19.040
Yeah, I signed up for it too, but my email box was empty.

01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:22.120
I don't know about yours, but I saw that story and then I cried.

01:47:22.120 --> 01:47:23.120
I haven't got anything yet either.

01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:24.120
But hey, you know what?

01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:26.640
There's still time, so maybe.

01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:29.480
Maybe it's one of those things where I won't be in the first wave, maybe a later wave.

01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:30.480
I'll be hopeful.

01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:35.280
But it gives me time to finish playing 13, because seriously, the beta for 14 is coming

01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:38.440
out two days after 13.

01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:41.760
Two days between Final Fantasy titles in the US, if you think about it.

01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:42.760
That's kind of strange.

01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:46.880
Well, and here's something else, if you think about it, if it's going into the beta now,

01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:49.880
maybe those May release dates are a little bit more accurate.

01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:53.520
I don't know about May, but I bet the end of the year.

01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:56.320
It sounds like Final Fantasy 14 will be out by the end of the year, and that's kind of

01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:57.320
weird.

01:47:57.320 --> 01:48:01.760
Like, I was not expecting it that soon, especially with 13 having taken as long as it did.

01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:03.960
So pleasant surprise, I suppose.

01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:04.960
Yes.

01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:05.960
Alright.

01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:10.700
Let's go over to Dark Sakura and whatever stories we skipped over because of all our

01:48:10.700 --> 01:48:12.720
discussions on unicorns.

01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:14.680
Acorn farting.

01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:22.120
Well, just quick stuff, SNK Playmore announced that King of Fighters 13, whatever, it better

01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:29.120
not suck like 12 did, but it's going to be run on Tytos Type X2 arcade hardware, the

01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:31.880
same one that Street Fighter 4, BlazBlue, blah blah.

01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:35.560
And hopefully it'll leak online, just like BlazBlue did.

01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:43.640
And then there's an online Digimon battle game that's supposed to be coming out in the

01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:47.760
US that's a version of the Korean Digimon RPG, which I actually, I think I'll freaking

01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:50.720
play that because I love Digimon.

01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:51.720
I know you do.

01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:54.260
Dude, I was a big fan- I think it's ironic that this story's coming

01:48:54.260 --> 01:48:57.320
out this week, because didn't we have some big discussion last week on Pokemon?

01:48:57.320 --> 01:49:03.160
Yeah, we were talking about like Pokemon versus, it was in the OLR Madness that's going on

01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:04.440
on the forums right now with the game voting.

01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:07.320
We were talking about Pokemon, you were like, whatever, I'm still into Digimon.

01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:14.680
Well, you know, I actually, I liked Digimon Zero 2 enough to have the movie on DVD, the

01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:21.720
Japanese version of it on DVD, and um, well, a couple of movies, and I have like the first

01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:25.240
two volumes of it on, of the Japanese version on DVD.

01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:30.100
Someone I used to date a long time ago, just went on a couple dates with, made me watch

01:49:30.100 --> 01:49:31.400
the Digimon movie.

01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:32.400
I remember that.

01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:36.480
You should watch the Japanese one, you should watch the Japanese one, it's actually really

01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:37.480
good.

01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:38.480
Is it?

01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:39.480
I think I saw the English one.

01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:45.920
So, alright, anyhow, going back into some other longer topics tonight, this one is one

01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:49.360
that somewhat hits close to home, let me talk about this.

01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:53.460
This is Activision doing a little bit of a douchey move this week.

01:49:53.460 --> 01:49:58.360
They have pulled the plug on what was a fan project for the King's Quest series.

01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:02.120
Now we've talked about this on the show before, it was a long time ago, but you might remember

01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:03.720
the Silver Lining.

01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:07.320
At one point this was called King's Quest IX, the Silver Lining, but then due to an

01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:12.160
agreement with Vivendi, who bought the rights to all the old Sierra games, they had to take

01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:16.560
out King's Quest out of the name, and they could develop this as like a community project

01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:18.560
with the Silver Lining.

01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:20.080
So they reached this little settlement.

01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:24.720
Well now, Activision owns it, because of all the acquisitions that go on and so forth,

01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:28.420
and Activision has demanded that this game stop completely.

01:50:28.420 --> 01:50:31.320
They're not honoring the old agreement.

01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:34.360
They have demanded that this cease and desist immediately.

01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:35.360
Fuck them!

01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:39.240
Phoenix Online has been doing this game since 2002.

01:50:39.240 --> 01:50:43.840
And then yeah, so Activision has basically said, even though they don't have plans on

01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:48.400
doing a sequel themselves, by the way, King's Quest is pretty much dead.

01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:50.700
I think they should release it anyway.

01:50:50.700 --> 01:50:54.200
Well they don't want to get sued, so I can't say I necessarily blame them.

01:50:54.200 --> 01:50:56.920
Change the name and release it for free.

01:50:56.920 --> 01:51:02.200
Now we actually, I believe we had one of the developers on the show many, many years ago.

01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:07.360
I think you'd have to go back to old, like the To-Go podcast from 2005-2006 to find this,

01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:10.720
but I want to say we had the guy on the show, because I remember going to some virtual press

01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:15.980
conference online thing about it, and we also hosted a mirror of one of the early betas

01:51:15.980 --> 01:51:18.860
for the game, I believe when it was still called King's Quest.

01:51:18.860 --> 01:51:22.520
I think one of the big things they were touting, if I remember right, again this was like four

01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:27.020
or five years ago, so please, my memory's a little shoddy, was that Roberta Williams

01:51:27.020 --> 01:51:31.340
actually knew of the project, and although she couldn't officially give it her blessing,

01:51:31.340 --> 01:51:34.400
she kind of gave it a wink and a nod, you know what I mean?

01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:36.800
We hosted the beta for this.

01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:41.640
I don't believe it went anywhere, I believe it's still on our website at orangelaunchradio.com

01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:43.120
slash tsl.

01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:47.160
I didn't get a letter, so do you want to see what this is all about?

01:51:47.160 --> 01:51:48.160
Have fun!

01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:53.520
I think it's kind of a douchey thing for Activision to do, when they know they're not, I mean

01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:57.280
I realize they're in their rights to do it, just like when Nintendo shut down the movie

01:51:57.280 --> 01:52:00.960
project, they were, the Zelda movie, we talked about this a couple months ago, they were

01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:06.300
in their rights to do it, but with Activision just having bought this, saying they're not

01:52:06.300 --> 01:52:10.040
going to do anything with it, but then putting the plug on this, when they already stripped

01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:16.120
anything that was King's Quest related out of it, that's just douchey.

01:52:16.120 --> 01:52:20.920
Activision gets our douche of the week award, there you go.

01:52:20.920 --> 01:52:26.180
So I think that's unfortunate, and you know my thought is, I'm kind of with Jamie, I say

01:52:26.180 --> 01:52:30.060
release it anyway, it's a torrent, but if you're really afraid of getting the pantsuit

01:52:30.060 --> 01:52:35.480
off of you, seriously go back, change the name, change some of the text, change the

01:52:35.480 --> 01:52:38.960
characters, nobody's going to freaking know.

01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:41.440
Activision is not going to seek it out that hardcore.

01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:45.120
If you go in and change the information so it's hard to detect that it once was the silver

01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:48.280
lining, I bet you you'll have it.

01:52:48.280 --> 01:52:49.280
We'll see.

01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:52.520
I'm curious to see if the game gets leaked, I bet it does, and once it hits the internet

01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:54.880
there is no going back.

01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:55.880
We'll see.

01:52:55.880 --> 01:52:59.120
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us up next?

01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:06.520
Well, in other news we have a game called Voice Fantasy.

01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:12.760
Square Enix has put a final trademark for it in Europe, and maybe it could be a Final

01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:20.160
Fantasy vocal CD, maybe, who knows, but it could be something cool, hopefully it will

01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:21.160
be cool.

01:53:21.160 --> 01:53:27.760
Maybe it'll be like a sing-star voice fantasy or something too.

01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:31.920
I guess it could be a karaoke controlled Final Fantasy 1, right?

01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:35.480
Or maybe one that you have to sing to progress your game or something.

01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:39.360
I want to fight, I want to cast holy.

01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:42.800
Or maybe you have to sing accurately to progress.

01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:46.000
Are you still playing the fucking unicorn game?

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Yes.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.000
God.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:52.440
Amaze Shitsuma in chat says, douche of the week award, so Shirmi will poop on them.

01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:58.040
Yes, we give a big Shirmi poop award to the folks at Activision this week.

01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:01.600
The next time she takes a shit on the floor I'll take a picture of it so we can just send

01:54:01.600 --> 01:54:02.600
it to whoever.

01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:04.760
I like that idea.

01:54:04.760 --> 01:54:05.760
That's a good idea.

01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:09.480
Loki, put down the game and read some news for us.

01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:10.480
Okay.

01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:16.320
No, this is not a big surprise because I don't think it's really taken off as far as I'm

01:54:16.320 --> 01:54:17.320
aware.

01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:18.320
PlayStation Home.

01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:23.520
Apparently advertisers are ignoring PlayStation Home, but they are interested in the PlayStation

01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:24.520
Network.

01:54:24.520 --> 01:54:31.920
Apparently a report coming from Brandweek saying that they're opting to pursue opportunities

01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:33.520
in Xbox Live instead.

01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:43.280
Apparently ad agency, looks like a publicist, Danaud, John Rafferty, they told the website

01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:48.480
from the moment one, or from moment one it felt kind of clunky.

01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:54.360
And once you got through that there wasn't much there regarding I guess the robotic nature

01:54:54.360 --> 01:54:57.080
of PlayStation Home.

01:54:57.080 --> 01:55:02.160
And I think, I mean it kind of makes sense because there's a lot of places to advertise

01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:08.320
in PlayStation Home but if you're like me, you don't use PlayStation Home so you're not

01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:15.360
seeing those ads so it makes more sense to put it on like say, you know, banner ads that

01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:19.120
are on the PlayStation Network or banner ads on the Xbox Live Marketplace because you're

01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:21.920
seeing those as you're going browsing for other things.

01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:24.040
I think you hit the nail on the head.

01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:28.520
There's no reason to go into PlayStation Home except when they launch something new that's

01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:32.280
usually you go in there once and you go, oh, huh, and then that's it.

01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:33.280
Neat.

01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:35.240
Just like that, remember that salt that was on there?

01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:36.240
Yeah, yeah.

01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:37.240
Yeah, went there once.

01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:40.400
Yeah, I went in there a couple of times and played it and got some of the little things

01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:42.400
and I was like, okay, done.

01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:43.400
Yeah.

01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:46.640
Because I think they wanted you to pay for like more and I was like, I don't really want

01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:47.640
to pay for this.

01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:48.640
Yeah.

01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:52.920
It's not really, I mean it's just a souped up version of a game I played on my 386 computer

01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:56.380
back in like 1993, you know.

01:55:56.380 --> 01:55:59.320
Not really into it.

01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:03.200
Well something that a lot of people are into is the idea of Nintendo starting over with

01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:04.680
a brand new Wii.

01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:11.720
Well it came out at the Nintendo Media Summit thanks to a GameSpot cornering Cami Dunaway.

01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:17.520
Basically they say that there's not going to be a Wii successor anytime soon.

01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:20.600
Apparently they're kind of looking for what happened with the PS2 is that they want to

01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:24.760
kind of re-emulate the fact that they're on top for years and years.

01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:28.360
Cami Dunaway was quoted in the GameSpot interview saying quote, even though our install base

01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:33.240
is at this point 5 million households larger than the PS2 install base was at the same

01:56:33.240 --> 01:56:36.760
point in the life cycle, it still has a lot of room to grow.

01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:40.080
If you think PS2, there's been about 50 million sold.

01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:42.900
Wii close to 25, 28 million sold.

01:56:42.900 --> 01:56:47.000
So it says to me there's still a big audience out there that we can access with the Wii.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:53.240
So basically we still have sold shitloads of these systems so why would we start over

01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:54.320
with something new?

01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:56.260
Just because the core gamers are mad.

01:56:56.260 --> 01:56:57.360
The soccer moms are happy.

01:56:57.360 --> 01:56:59.320
So F you.

01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:03.180
It's raining money at my world hahaha.

01:57:03.180 --> 01:57:07.480
So don't expect a new Wii to be announced at E3 this year.

01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:14.080
But I think in great Nintendo fashion their way around this would be releasing the Wii

01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:21.440
HD or something along those lines where it's not necessarily a whole new system but it's

01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:25.200
a Wii plus like the DS Lite or something like that, you know what I mean?

01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:29.120
That's what I could see Nintendo doing and then saying well it's still a Wii.

01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:30.120
Yeah.

01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:32.360
I don't know.

01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:33.600
We'll see.

01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:38.520
Alright anyhow we're gonna get into that section of the show where we interact with your emails.

01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:42.560
It's the mailbag segment here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:45.920
Every week Dark Sakura opens up the mailbag.

01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:48.440
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:54.000
It's all one word, mailbag, M-A-I-L-B-A-G at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you have an email

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:55.160
you want Dark Sakura to read.

01:57:55.160 --> 01:57:58.280
Looks like a lot of people took the opportunity this week, didn't they Dark Sakura?

01:57:58.280 --> 01:57:59.280
Yeah.

01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:01.440
Alright well get to reading.

01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:04.440
Hey OLR Kardashians, okay.

01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:09.400
I just discovered that I could walk from where I live to Valve's headquarters, yeah.

01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:12.920
And there's a Gameworks in downtown Seattle that has BlazBlue, Street Fighter 4, Tatsunoko

01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:18.480
vs Capcom, King of Fighters 1 million, and a few pinball thingies so if you ever are

01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:20.280
up there for PAX I would recommend stopping by.

01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:21.280
We went there.

01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:22.280
Yeah we did.

01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:23.280
We did stop by.

01:58:23.280 --> 01:58:25.640
They had that whole room of Sega cranes, right?

01:58:25.640 --> 01:58:26.640
Yeah.

01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:27.640
Yeah.

01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:28.640
And I played a few.

01:58:28.640 --> 01:58:31.440
Oh since I'm entering high school I was wondering if I should learn Japanese.

01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:32.440
Is it hard?

01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:37.000
I would kind of want to know what my important future is telling me.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:40.040
Typed with minor precision at 1240 AM, Austin.

01:58:40.040 --> 01:58:46.460
Just to let you know, Japanese is not an easy language because honestly I think the biggest

01:58:46.460 --> 01:58:49.560
difficulty in Japanese is the grammar.

01:58:49.560 --> 01:58:52.400
Not necessarily the vocabulary but the grammar.

01:58:52.400 --> 01:58:53.720
It's a little convoluted.

01:58:53.720 --> 01:58:57.360
I was a Japanese major for a little while.

01:58:57.360 --> 01:59:01.080
I know a few sites that will give you beginner lessons.

01:59:01.080 --> 01:59:03.360
You can find them for free.

01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:07.460
I think one is called iLearn or something but yeah just try a couple of those little

01:59:07.460 --> 01:59:13.240
online sites and see what you think because I mean it really is kind of a convoluted in

01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:15.360
comparison to English.

01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:18.680
It really depends on what industry you want to get into when you get older and maybe you're

01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:21.720
too young to know that now if you're just kind of like now going into high school which

01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:24.440
you're probably too young to listen to this show actually so but.

01:59:24.440 --> 01:59:28.840
Also depending on where you live because when I lived in Alabama it was good for me to know

01:59:28.840 --> 01:59:29.940
French.

01:59:29.940 --> 01:59:32.960
And here in California it's really good to know Spanish.

01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:34.000
It's really good to know it.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:38.160
I mean that's just you know there's a lot of jobs out there where they really want bilingual

01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:40.880
people that speak Spanish so you might want to think about that.

01:59:40.880 --> 01:59:43.240
I mean is Japanese really practical?

01:59:43.240 --> 01:59:47.520
Well if you wanted to get into an industry that has to do with technology and possibly

01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:51.800
you know relocating to Japan or working closely with Japanese business or finances.

01:59:51.800 --> 01:59:52.800
Or going into the JET program.

01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:57.520
Yeah any of that you know then yeah Japanese is going to be a practical language to learn.

01:59:57.520 --> 02:00:00.280
Again you might be a little young to really know what you want to do.

02:00:00.280 --> 02:00:02.400
When I was 15 I hadn't a clue.

02:00:02.400 --> 02:00:03.400
Well I did have a clue.

02:00:03.400 --> 02:00:06.920
I wanted to be a game show host but that didn't quite pan out.

02:00:06.920 --> 02:00:12.080
I ended up changing my mind when I was like 24 on what I wanted to do.

02:00:12.080 --> 02:00:13.720
So I changed my major eight times.

02:00:13.720 --> 02:00:15.480
Yeah and most people do.

02:00:15.480 --> 02:00:17.660
But just try to think maybe like one step ahead.

02:00:17.660 --> 02:00:21.480
Am I just learning this because I think it'd be cool or you know is there like maybe a

02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:22.680
practical use to this.

02:00:22.680 --> 02:00:25.880
I think you'll thank yourself later.

02:00:25.880 --> 02:00:29.960
Anyhow yeah but I agree with the Kuma JP.

02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:31.140
Do it while you're young.

02:00:31.140 --> 02:00:33.840
Learn a new language because it's much harder when you're older.

02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:36.600
And I tried to learn a second language in high school.

02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:41.520
I tried to learn Spanish and unfortunately I this is going to sound terrible because

02:00:41.520 --> 02:00:45.040
you know I am a teacher of sorts even though I teach in a corporate environment as my day

02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:47.000
job.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:51.560
And I think teachers do great things but I had a Spanish teacher that was so terrible

02:00:51.560 --> 02:00:53.360
she actually ruined Spanish for me.

02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:57.060
Like I was not able to learn a language because this lady was so bad.

02:00:57.060 --> 02:00:58.400
Thankfully she's not teaching anymore.

02:00:58.400 --> 02:01:00.720
She didn't she didn't keep teaching very long.

02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:04.920
But it's unfortunate that that one person kind of screwed it up.

02:01:04.920 --> 02:01:05.920
You know.

02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:09.840
I accidentally closed one of the emails and I don't remember which one it is.

02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:10.840
Uh oh.

02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:11.840
Spiadio.

02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:13.040
Well okay.

02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:15.800
This is from Tolgak.

02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:19.600
After thinking about the Ubisoft DRM scheme I got to thinking what would happen if someone

02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:22.360
DDOS'd the servers.

02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:27.480
It seems to me like that would be the perfect target for DDOS attack to cause maximum damage.

02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:32.640
A normal DDOS would only disrupt traffic but an attack against Ubisoft servers would cause

02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:35.680
everyone's games to shut off and swamp their phone line.

02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:38.840
I was wondering what you guys thought about this problem.

02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:42.880
As a side question I wanted to know what you guys thought about having a homebrew no piracy

02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:47.600
and tech themed show on all games co-hosted by me and Jaded.

02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:49.720
By the way awesome show on the 22nd.

02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:50.720
Who's that from?

02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:51.720
Tolgak.

02:01:51.720 --> 02:01:59.800
My first question about the um the I'm sorry the what oh the DDOS on the Ubisoft site sorry

02:01:59.800 --> 02:02:04.000
I thought you had another comment um as far as that goes I think you just give another

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:10.400
reason to add to the list of why this type of copyright protection is stupid so just

02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:12.040
add that to the ongoing list.

02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:13.240
You bring up a valid point.

02:02:13.240 --> 02:02:16.920
If Ubisoft gets DDOS there's really nothing to stop it's the same thing as the server

02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:19.080
going down for whatever technical reason.

02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:22.160
As far as the question about your all games podcast um that's something that has to be

02:02:22.160 --> 02:02:26.640
decided by the all games staff which um although we're happy to work with them we don't make

02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:30.800
decisions there so uh you wanna check out all games dot com and I know there's links

02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:35.000
there on like how to submit your show and so forth so just kinda dig around there um

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:39.040
and I'm sure you'll find it or get in touch with me in chat and I can put you in touch

02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:40.040
with the right people.

02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:41.800
New blood fresh meat.

02:02:41.800 --> 02:02:45.160
Yeah I mean I know they're open to having more ideas and I know what one thing that

02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:50.440
they don't want is they really don't want more general video game discussion shows cause

02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:54.800
you know they already have a lot of them including us um admittedly although we've been doing

02:02:54.800 --> 02:02:58.480
what we do a long time uh but I think the idea of like a niche.

02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:04.720
I don't know of well yeah I know we are but um I think also uh the idea of like a home

02:03:04.720 --> 02:03:09.920
brew and I don't know of a show like that on all games unless I'm really behind on who's

02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:13.680
on the network right now so I think that's always a good thing if you think of an idea

02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:15.400
for a show that no one's done yet.

02:03:15.400 --> 02:03:16.960
There you go.

02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:18.880
Okay well moving on.

02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:24.120
Hey OLR crew AZHP here again I was listening live to your show on Sunday though I wasn't

02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:28.000
in chat because I was putting together Ikea furniture at the time I'm sorry.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:31.360
Anyway when I heard you all report on the Ubisoft DRM that requires you to be on the

02:03:31.360 --> 02:03:36.800
internet constantly in order to play Assassin's Creed 2 my first thought was are Ubisoft insane?

02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:40.760
Do they want people to pirate their game because honestly once it's cracked the pirate versions

02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:43.160
will actually be better than a retail copy.

02:03:43.160 --> 02:03:46.920
You won't have to be connected to the internet to play and if your internet goes down during

02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:50.760
the middle of the game it won't matter PC Gamer apparently did a test run of the DRM

02:03:50.760 --> 02:03:54.400
and if you are playing and your internet goes out you won't even get a chance to quick save

02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:56.200
before it boots you out of the game.

02:03:56.200 --> 02:03:59.360
You lose all your progress since your last save.

02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:02.800
Someone obviously dropped the ball here and is completely out of touch with gamers.

02:04:02.800 --> 02:04:06.100
I was going to buy Assassin's Creed 2 but after hearing about this I don't think I will

02:04:06.100 --> 02:04:07.240
anymore.

02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:11.320
Now I don't think I'm going to pirate it since I'm not really interested in the game but

02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:15.000
it doesn't seem like Ubisoft is actually encouraging people to pirate the game so they won't have

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:19.280
to deal with that DRM yours truly is HP and I just think that they're stupid.

02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:23.560
I really have no comment I agree with your email 100% I really have nothing else to say

02:04:23.560 --> 02:04:28.080
I think what you say is absolutely valid it's just encouraging piracy.

02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:32.040
Alright next email it's kind of a cool email.

02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:35.760
Hey OLR gang a quick question here I'm a techie very much like yourselves and I have a few

02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:39.280
electronics in the house however it's starting to become a problem as I have a few wires

02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:41.720
just dangling and crossing under my gaming desk.

02:04:41.720 --> 02:04:46.620
My Wii, Xbox 360, computer setup all share the same space do you have any personal home

02:04:46.620 --> 02:04:51.760
solutions or recommendations for organizing an otherwise jungle of wires as well as saving

02:04:51.760 --> 02:04:55.280
me the time and money in the long run eliminating a potential fire hazard.

02:04:55.280 --> 02:04:56.340
Randy from Texas.

02:04:56.340 --> 02:05:01.400
I do I have a lot of suggestions because we do them please you can get a switch box first

02:05:01.400 --> 02:05:06.680
of all for your systems you can also what we do in the studio is we have zip ties for

02:05:06.680 --> 02:05:12.760
the although we don't really use them anymore but we have zip ties for our our cables for

02:05:12.760 --> 02:05:17.520
our mics and for the the plugs and various hookups that way we can minimize what's there

02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:23.120
to trip over you can also get I believe you can get them at Fry's or any electronics store

02:05:23.120 --> 02:05:27.620
or computer store or just in general you can actually buy them online they're these kind

02:05:27.620 --> 02:05:33.640
of long twisty things that they look like the like the the plastic ring binders you

02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:38.400
know they go on like presentation books and stuff but you wrap you bind your cords together

02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:43.320
and wrap them around your cords and then it leaves them as a long trail you can also duct

02:05:43.320 --> 02:05:49.560
tape them to the floor I mean seriously my you can use electrical tape to bind them together

02:05:49.560 --> 02:05:57.120
to my computer actually let me put in my my card my new graphics card we actually just

02:05:57.120 --> 02:06:03.320
electrical taped all the bonus wires together so there's lots of stuff that you can do and

02:06:03.320 --> 02:06:07.580
really you can get almost any of these things you know really cheap you can buy twist ties

02:06:07.580 --> 02:06:12.400
you can get leftover ties we use in the studio or at the 99 cent store yeah I bought a pack

02:06:12.400 --> 02:06:17.760
of eight of them for a dollar you know so you just have to look around you know really

02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:22.480
the thing that you want to do is find something that's going to be non flammable something

02:06:22.480 --> 02:06:26.680
that can bind them together honestly if you want something that's going to hold them securely

02:06:26.680 --> 02:06:32.360
your best bet get a switch box or if you have them you know multiple hookups to your TV

02:06:32.360 --> 02:06:37.080
I would get electrical tape and bind the ones to each specific system together and also

02:06:37.080 --> 02:06:41.440
if you leave them at the right length for your binding you can if you need to transport

02:06:41.440 --> 02:06:46.600
them just unplug them and move them easily and labels go a long freaking way even though

02:06:46.600 --> 02:06:50.720
you might be thinking oh what a pain in the butt or you know they're so silly if you just

02:06:50.720 --> 02:06:55.480
like label your wires at both ends oh my god you will be so happy later if you ever had

02:06:55.480 --> 02:07:00.560
to move if you use the electrical tape method just get a sharpie right on the electrical

02:07:00.560 --> 02:07:05.760
tape yeah ps3 you know it's very easy well you've seen the box of cables that we have

02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:09.480
rob obviously where it's like you sort of have to look at the end and guess what it

02:07:09.480 --> 02:07:16.280
is and oh be afraid if you happen to find an n64 or a super nintendo thing because they

02:07:16.280 --> 02:07:21.640
use the same ones practically you know or if you happen to accidentally hook up your

02:07:21.640 --> 02:07:28.080
japanese playstation to you know adapter and then realize it won't fit in your us one and

02:07:28.080 --> 02:07:32.960
you know i'm just going off because it really does it really does help of course we have

02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:39.720
big bins now in the vault where we keep all of that and don't know which one's which tape

02:07:39.720 --> 02:07:48.400
all right also for speaker cables i'm just saying um you can get these uh plastic pieces

02:07:48.400 --> 02:07:53.480
like for example if you're like we have our um surround sound wired and we didn't wire

02:07:53.480 --> 02:07:57.320
it under the uh floor or anything yet but you can't and this is something i wanted to

02:07:57.320 --> 02:08:01.680
do we haven't done it yet but you can get these plastic strips that you can adhere to

02:08:01.680 --> 02:08:06.920
the floor that go the easement office buildings you know that to keep you from tripping over

02:08:06.920 --> 02:08:13.400
wires that happen to be spread like for your speakers and whatnot so good suggestions yeah

02:08:13.400 --> 02:08:17.840
you can find this anywhere just make sure that you get something that's you know electronic

02:08:17.840 --> 02:08:27.300
safe and fire safe more emails one more it's long yay long email long email is long

02:08:27.300 --> 02:08:32.960
i can't stop playing this are you still playing the magic unicorn game i'm gonna have a racer

02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:39.320
stuck in my head on i'm gonna be having nightmares about erasure hello there olr this is uh gditz

02:08:39.320 --> 02:08:44.040
writing in i'm the swedish dude who called a few shows ago and talked about drm and seeing

02:08:44.040 --> 02:08:48.840
as exams are closing and i can't really spare the time to attend the next live show so i

02:08:48.840 --> 02:08:53.480
figured i'd answer the call for european to write about it oh good the high piracy rate

02:08:53.480 --> 02:08:58.180
over here and what might be the cause of it first off i don't have a lot of insight on

02:08:58.180 --> 02:09:02.560
how game releases or pricing works in italy where the highest rate of piracy occurred

02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:07.140
according to the study presented in last week's show i do however live in sweden where the

02:09:07.140 --> 02:09:13.800
famous pirate bay bit torrent site was founded and where piracy is also frequent and now

02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:18.760
there are quite a few factors as to why i have many times been tempted to pirate release

02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:23.560
one of the biggest factors is for me whether or not i can purchase purchase a product legally

02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:28.360
i hit something um when it comes to anime for example there usually isn't a retailer

02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:32.140
around here to supply them if there is it's all dubbed or subbed in swedish which isn't

02:09:32.140 --> 02:09:38.120
how i like my anime agreed i hate most english dubs you know i like watching when japanese

02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:42.320
with subtitles another annoying thing is that the delay between us releasing the european

02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:47.780
one usually it's usually a week or just a few days but once in a while a game takes

02:09:47.780 --> 02:09:52.000
almost a full year to get over here one example is rock band 2 with the instrument bundle

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:55.640
and at the time of its release i didn't have any rhythm hardware for my ps3 and was stuck

02:09:55.640 --> 02:09:59.520
with a hard decision from all the reviews and talk about rock band 2 and guitar hero

02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:04.320
4 it was quickly confirmed that the second hardware iteration from the makers of rock

02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:09.260
band was superior one and the game was also thought to be better but with the release

02:10:09.260 --> 02:10:14.000
of rock band 2 bundle in europe wasn't even sent while guitar hero 4 was due in just a

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:17.880
few months now piracy wasn't an option since i needed the hardware and ended up buying

02:10:17.880 --> 02:10:21.800
guitar hero 4 bundle to get the hardware and then bought rock band 2 disc which arrived

02:10:21.800 --> 02:10:26.920
two weeks before guitar hero 4 as a side effect of this i now despise harmonix a bit for not

02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:34.560
being able to ship hardware in a reasonable amount of time sorry drm now drm isn't different

02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:39.160
for us europeans but it's still something to consider when buying a product even more

02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:43.040
if you want to lend it to a friend install it several times just be able to play it without

02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:48.520
an internet connection the worst drm i have to deal with on a daily basis is a cad computer

02:10:48.520 --> 02:10:53.760
aided design program used for making mechanical parts and design requires not only a constant

02:10:53.760 --> 02:10:59.320
online connection but also requires said connection to go through the school network um we're

02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:03.820
using autocad interesting you know and we don't talk a lot about the the schemes used

02:11:03.820 --> 02:11:10.040
in non-games well this means i have to run i have to vpn to the school network at all

02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:14.080
times when using said software i can't even imagine how such extreme restrictions would

02:11:14.080 --> 02:11:19.320
urge people to buy it when a pirated copy would mean a lot less hassle cost this is

02:11:19.320 --> 02:11:23.360
one of the biggest hurdle for many people myself included and it goes a bit beyond what

02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:27.800
americans have to go through from what i gather a new retail game over in the us cost about

02:11:27.800 --> 02:11:36.320
60 which would be the equivalent of 450 swedish a swedish kroner however we have a value added

02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:40.680
tax for each and every item we purchase in stores where the rate for any item can be

02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:46.520
6 12 or even 25 added to the price in short a video game costs a swedish person 600 kroners

02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:52.000
which is the equivalent of 80 even if i know the tax goes to education government funding

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:57.040
and health care it still leaves a big hole in my wallet every time i buy a video game

02:11:57.040 --> 02:12:01.600
summary hopefully this letter gave you guys a better image of what gaming and the gamer

02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:06.320
lifestyle is like across the sea even if we sometimes get treated as less as less important

02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:10.800
market we still have to we still like to support our favorite developers and actually pay for

02:12:10.800 --> 02:12:15.040
games we enjoy if you have any more questions i'll be happy to answer them when i get the

02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:19.960
time but for now i have to get back to studying jeditz out good luck with your exams by the

02:12:19.960 --> 02:12:25.940
way yes good email um i i'm a little sad though that it didn't come from one of the countries

02:12:25.940 --> 02:12:29.520
that was really high on the list because i don't recall sweden being in the top 10 well

02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:34.680
i do i do appreciate sweden very much without them we would not have abba but you know what

02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:29.760
yeah there you go but i still wanted to read it it was short and why not why not we'd like

02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:34.880

two people that find it um necessary to stop their car a good four or five car lengths

02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:12.080
behind the other car that's in front of them preventing you from going around them because

02:15:12.080 --> 02:15:16.640
they're douchebags not only that they kind of drive slow or take turns really wide or

02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:24.060
take turns really slow so a few bad drivers um i don't really have a lot of fus to be

02:15:24.060 --> 02:15:28.800

02:17:05.760 --> 02:17:11.840
one likes to pay for stuff anyways sometimes you have to that's how society works yeah

02:17:11.840 --> 02:17:21.040
damn commerce alright um one more story for you guys then we're gonna open up the skype

02:17:21.040 --> 02:17:25.920
line at 1877 game olr our username on skype is orange lounge radio and that has to do

02:17:25.920 --> 02:17:30.880
with a teaser trailer that was released this week um there's a new teaser trailer that

02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:36.520
just uh hit the internet for pac-man battle royale yes it looks like that that early trademark

02:17:36.520 --> 02:17:41.400
that was discovered is true there is a new pac-man game coming out and it's called battle

02:17:41.400 --> 02:17:46.400
royale outside of that what else is this game about i don't know because this is probably

02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:51.420
the worst teaser trailer i've ever seen in my life it's 13 seconds ready here it is there's

02:17:51.420 --> 02:18:00.240
the namco logo and then oh yes i know that noise that's pac-man there's the logo that's

02:18:00.240 --> 02:18:04.920
it sneak peek at amusement expo 2010 that was the whole teaser right there they didn't

02:18:04.920 --> 02:18:10.640
tease anything we already kind of knew about it was a tease we're gonna tease you and let

02:18:10.640 --> 02:18:17.120
you think that we've given you a teaser oh tease right but you can see at least on the

02:18:17.120 --> 02:18:21.560
logo that there are four different colored pac-mans there's a yellow a red a pink and

02:18:21.560 --> 02:18:25.920
a blue kind of like the ghosts in a weird way although i believe one of the ghosts is

02:18:25.920 --> 02:18:30.040
orange not yellow but still it's chasing a ghost but it did they are chasing a ghost

02:18:30.040 --> 02:18:35.200
so maybe it's some type of multiplayer pac-man ce that seems to be the popular thought as

02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:40.280
to what this is all about plus they are showing this at the amusement expo 2010 so the thought

02:18:40.280 --> 02:18:47.960
is mm arcade game possibly yeah arcade games so that's always good news to know that new

02:18:47.960 --> 02:18:51.560
arcade games are coming out because unfortunately it's a genre we don't hear enough of in this

02:18:51.560 --> 02:18:57.360
day and age so there it is all right we're gonna go to the skype line right now at one

02:18:57.360 --> 02:19:01.600
eight seven seven game olr or our username on skype is orange lounge radio and take some

02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:05.800

for those new to the show i'm in chile right now uh-huh so so that's the big place that's

02:19:32.480 --> 02:19:37.040
on the news lately because of an earthquake yes we've heard about it and where exactly

02:19:37.040 --> 02:19:41.560
in chile are you i'm actually in santiago like in one of the major cities i was hit

02:19:41.560 --> 02:19:46.640
by it wow are you but you're calling into the show so your internet's working i mean

02:19:46.640 --> 02:19:51.440
is everything actually my my internet was working before my phone worked wow it's crazy

02:19:51.440 --> 02:19:55.840
i don't understand how that happened the first thing i could do to tell like my mother in

02:19:55.840 --> 02:20:01.040
argentina and like my friends and stuff that i was okay was through facebook wow weirdest

02:20:01.040 --> 02:20:05.520
thing no no uh-oh this kind of leads into that whole talk we were having about social

02:20:05.520 --> 02:20:08.760
networking did you hear that didn't i say that there are legitimate reasons and then

02:20:08.760 --> 02:20:13.600
there's just the crap yes but it's it's it's still interesting in this context honestly

02:20:13.600 --> 02:20:19.860
in that context the first click i did was to hit submit to say i'm okay the second click

02:20:19.860 --> 02:20:26.680
was to join the i survived the earthquake group that's exactly what i did very nice

02:20:26.680 --> 02:20:31.240
very nice well i'm i'm really glad to know you're doing okay and for any of our listeners

02:20:31.240 --> 02:20:35.760
who might remember you from your previous phone calls um i'm i'm sure they're glad to

02:20:35.760 --> 02:20:40.400
hear that you're okay too so yeah i'm assuming that's um vj ramen's idea that i that i call

02:20:40.400 --> 02:20:44.200
in to let people know in case they hadn't heard but yeah no that's good to know are

02:20:44.200 --> 02:20:47.800
you still doing a regular show i know you used to do the role-playing show but i think

02:20:47.800 --> 02:20:53.520
you guys put that on hold right yeah well i moved here chile last year and uh i had

02:20:53.520 --> 02:20:57.640
to put it on hold because of you know work and not knowing my schedule and stuff so i

02:20:57.640 --> 02:21:02.640
put it i didn't put it on hold myself i gave the show like the reins of it to one of the

02:21:02.640 --> 02:21:07.960
co-hosts and he decided to put it on hold and definitely so gotcha that's that but you

02:21:07.960 --> 02:21:12.880
know i've been like uh about two weeks ago i was on a guest thing on video game news

02:21:12.880 --> 02:21:17.920
radio oh fun so you know i was there if you care to listen to my musings but are those

02:21:17.920 --> 02:21:22.800
the guys in cleveland or am i yeah they are they are okay oh wow okay cool yeah they're

02:21:22.800 --> 02:21:26.240
the other guys that have been doing this a show forever like i think they've been on

02:21:26.240 --> 02:21:29.720
about as long as we have this show as long as you guys have it's crazy that's cool yeah

02:21:29.720 --> 02:21:33.640
it's a very different show than us it's it's more yeah you must have been calling in to

02:21:33.640 --> 02:21:39.880
talk about uh like halo 3 or or some of the shooter games because they play or the call

02:21:39.880 --> 02:21:44.840
of duty type stuff that's oh that's that's more the type of stuff they get into right

02:21:44.840 --> 02:21:48.520
the best thing that they do is when they talk about nothing that's related to video games

02:21:48.520 --> 02:21:53.000
honestly they just go on rants about how one of them is a trucker the other one is you

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:57.360
know a part of a job and it's hilarious i don't know how interesting that uh that would

02:21:57.360 --> 02:22:01.500
be the uh interesting part of their show too honestly they actually had a spin-off they

02:22:01.500 --> 02:22:07.200
have a spin-off show uh that they called some midwest wasteland i believe the name and uh

02:22:07.200 --> 02:22:10.080
that's all they talk about like they just said you know what we're gonna scrap the video

02:22:10.080 --> 02:22:14.920
game part of it and just go with what people actually like so it's pretty funny it's interesting

02:22:14.920 --> 02:22:19.240
you bring up spin-off shows because you know jamie was doing a comic podcast for a while

02:22:19.240 --> 02:22:22.880
and i know she had to put that on hold but uh there might be other spin-off shows in

02:22:22.880 --> 02:22:27.720
the works you never know what might be coming so stay tuned so uh yeah you know i just wanted

02:22:27.720 --> 02:22:32.180
to call in about that uh i didn't get hurt more than you know you know scraps bruises

02:22:32.180 --> 02:22:36.840
that kind of thing from you know moving debris and stuff because one of our walls actually

02:22:36.840 --> 02:22:41.720
came down wow uh that separates our well like our house from the neighbors and it fell down

02:22:41.720 --> 02:22:47.560
on our cars so so our cars are now like you know they're covering rubble and now they

02:22:47.560 --> 02:22:51.480
need to be repaired and stuff i remember jamie had a wall fall on her car i was just about

02:22:51.480 --> 02:22:56.960
to say yeah i remember that happening it was um at my old apartment complex we had uh this

02:22:56.960 --> 02:23:04.120
sort of uh stucco and brick wall that was around uh the dumpster and we had that windstorm

02:23:04.120 --> 02:23:09.720
and the wall actually fell over on the car right yeah and it just dented one ridge on

02:23:09.720 --> 02:23:14.040
it from where it impacted thankfully the car was still drivable though it looked like like

02:23:14.040 --> 02:23:20.840
a just a ugly thing but yeah that's a car it's here so the car is just a car it's replaced

02:23:20.840 --> 02:23:24.280
yeah that's yeah that's the only thing i can be thankful of although i mean i don't know

02:23:24.280 --> 02:23:28.280
you guys are in california so you kind of are used to like you know the earth shaking

02:23:28.280 --> 02:23:34.000
i suppose the place we live is not nearly as bad with the earthquakes we've felt a few

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:37.280
but they're usually not that bad but i do go to san francisco a lot and i have a lot

02:23:37.280 --> 02:23:39.960
of friends over there you know and it's a little more it's a little more prevalent over

02:23:39.960 --> 02:23:46.060
there um but it's just it's weird how many earthquakes there have been lately like in

02:23:46.060 --> 02:23:51.600
the last two months there have been four major earthquakes haiti chile japan and taiwan and

02:23:51.600 --> 02:23:55.860
there was all the same there was also a pretty big one in california on the north coast it

02:23:55.860 --> 02:24:01.340
was off the coast but it was uh the out in the ocean by eureka like i remember it made

02:24:01.340 --> 02:24:06.160
the news here it was it was above a six it's a pretty big deal yeah well actually we've

02:24:06.160 --> 02:24:11.080
We've been having, you know, the earthquake itself here, where it hit here in Santiago

02:24:11.080 --> 02:24:13.080
was about 7 point something.

02:24:13.080 --> 02:24:17.480
It wasn't quite 8 and at the epicenter it was 8.8.

02:24:17.480 --> 02:24:18.480
But we've been...

02:24:18.480 --> 02:24:19.480
We've got 2012, 2012, 2012.

02:24:19.480 --> 02:24:25.120
Yeah, if you look at the footage that you will see on TV, most likely from that place,

02:24:25.120 --> 02:24:28.160
which is about 300 kilometers away from here.

02:24:28.160 --> 02:24:30.600
But still, you know, in earthquake distances that's nothing.

02:24:30.600 --> 02:24:32.780
Like it still hits pretty hard all around.

02:24:32.780 --> 02:24:38.080
So, you know, it wasn't as bad as that, but still what's funny or not that funny actually

02:24:38.080 --> 02:24:43.320
and that actually has me scared shitless lately is that every few hours there's going to be

02:24:43.320 --> 02:24:44.320
an aftershock.

02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:49.560
And those aftershocks can reach 6.1, 6.5 and all of a sudden you're just doing your things

02:24:49.560 --> 02:24:51.240
and everything's just shaking again.

02:24:51.240 --> 02:24:56.720
And you know, after we're waking up at 3.34 a.m. to an earthquake that, you know, fell

02:24:56.720 --> 02:25:00.840
the wall on your car, you know, you get really nervous all the time.

02:25:00.840 --> 02:25:04.600
Especially for me, this is my first major thing because I live in Argentina.

02:25:04.600 --> 02:25:05.600
Nothing happens.

02:25:05.600 --> 02:25:06.600
Like there's no earthquakes, no tornadoes.

02:25:06.600 --> 02:25:09.440
Well, I heard they felt this one in Buenos Aires, so...

02:25:09.440 --> 02:25:15.360
Yeah, yeah, but I've been in Buenos Aires when we quote unquote feel an earthquake and

02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:18.360
it's like, oh, look, there's a wind gust.

02:25:18.360 --> 02:25:19.840
And it's like it's nothing.

02:25:19.840 --> 02:25:22.720
But like being here, I was honestly just...

02:25:22.720 --> 02:25:24.520
I don't remember being afraid.

02:25:24.520 --> 02:25:25.520
I don't remember anything.

02:25:25.520 --> 02:25:31.680
I just remember like running away outside, away from trees and walls, just, you know.

02:25:31.680 --> 02:25:36.240
Footy monster, just, you know, just do your best to be safe and, you know, don't live

02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:41.360
in fear too bad because, you know, if it's your time, then lightning could strike you

02:25:41.360 --> 02:25:43.360
when you're walking down the street, you know.

02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:45.000
That's true.

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:46.040
Anything could happen ever.

02:25:46.040 --> 02:25:47.040
So don't live in fear.

02:25:47.040 --> 02:25:48.120
But always have a plan.

02:25:48.120 --> 02:25:51.840
And I think this is a good lesson for all the listeners.

02:25:51.840 --> 02:25:55.200
You know, even though we're a video gaming podcast, this is still a good opportunity

02:25:55.200 --> 02:26:00.120
to talk about, you know, if something bad happens, do you know what you would do?

02:26:00.120 --> 02:26:03.760
Like for example, you listening to this show, bam, something's happening right now.

02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:04.760
There's an emergency.

02:26:04.760 --> 02:26:06.520
An earthquake happens where you are right now.

02:26:06.520 --> 02:26:07.520
Do you know what you would do?

02:26:07.520 --> 02:26:12.360
I have one piece of advice in regards to that because it's been baffling my mind what people

02:26:12.360 --> 02:26:13.800
have been doing here.

02:26:13.800 --> 02:26:17.880
If there's an earthquake going on, if there's some sort of natural disaster going around

02:26:17.880 --> 02:26:20.360
you, don't grab your laptop.

02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:22.080
Don't grab your DS.

02:26:22.080 --> 02:26:23.080
Just get out.

02:26:23.080 --> 02:26:24.080
Just go get...

02:26:24.080 --> 02:26:25.080
Be safe.

02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:27.600
Put your long shoes on because that's probably going to be dangerous if you're just walking

02:26:27.600 --> 02:26:31.600
in a flooded place and, you know, try to get shoes at least.

02:26:31.600 --> 02:26:34.400
But other than that, just get out and everything else is replaceable.

02:26:34.400 --> 02:26:39.320
I've been looking at people ransacking like supermarkets and department stores and they're

02:26:39.320 --> 02:26:44.440
taking LCDs with them when they don't even have a house anymore and then to feed themselves.

02:26:44.440 --> 02:26:45.440
I don't even get it.

02:26:45.440 --> 02:26:46.680
Like some people are stupid.

02:26:46.680 --> 02:26:48.040
They react stupidly to this thing.

02:26:48.040 --> 02:26:49.560
So that would be my advice.

02:26:49.560 --> 02:26:50.560
Be smart.

02:26:50.560 --> 02:26:51.920
Just be safe first.

02:26:51.920 --> 02:26:53.520
Then worry about everything material.

02:26:53.520 --> 02:26:57.920
That is some unfortunate but necessary advice, especially for a tech-savvy crowd.

02:26:57.920 --> 02:27:01.360
Footy, I'm going to have to let you go to get some more calls, but stay safe, okay?

02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:02.360
All right.

02:27:02.360 --> 02:27:03.360
Thank you so much, guys.

02:27:03.360 --> 02:27:04.360
We're all thinking of you.

02:27:04.360 --> 02:27:05.360
Take care.

02:27:05.360 --> 02:27:06.360
You too.

02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:07.360
Bye.

02:27:07.360 --> 02:27:08.360
Oof.

02:27:08.360 --> 02:27:09.360
I hope that's the last of it.

02:27:09.360 --> 02:27:10.360
I hope there's not another big earthquake coming.

02:27:10.360 --> 02:27:11.360
Oh, boy.

02:27:11.360 --> 02:27:12.360
Oh, boy.

02:27:12.360 --> 02:27:13.360
All right.

02:27:13.360 --> 02:27:14.960
Well, we still have time for some more calls.

02:27:14.960 --> 02:27:15.960
1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:18.360
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:27:18.360 --> 02:27:19.360
Feel free to call in.

02:27:19.360 --> 02:27:21.440
Tell some dick and fart jokes to kind of relieve the tension a little bit.

02:27:21.440 --> 02:27:22.440
It'd be nice.

02:27:22.440 --> 02:27:25.400
We're going to talk about the unicorn game with Loki because he will not stop playing

02:27:25.400 --> 02:27:26.400
it over there.

02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:27.400
I can't help it.

02:27:27.400 --> 02:27:28.400
It's so addicting.

02:27:28.400 --> 02:27:29.400
I just found something else disturbing.

02:27:29.400 --> 02:27:30.400
Sure.

02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:31.400
What's that?

02:27:31.400 --> 02:27:32.800
The Wonder Twins are on Smallville now.

02:27:32.800 --> 02:27:34.280
Goody, goody.

02:27:34.280 --> 02:27:35.920
What's that mean?

02:27:35.920 --> 02:27:37.480
Wonder Twin powers activated.

02:27:37.480 --> 02:27:38.480
Oh, God.

02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:39.480
Wow.

02:27:39.480 --> 02:27:40.480
Amazing.

02:27:40.480 --> 02:27:41.480
All right.

02:27:41.480 --> 02:27:42.480
Let's go to the phones.

02:27:42.480 --> 02:27:43.480
Hi.

02:27:43.480 --> 02:27:44.480
You're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:27:44.480 --> 02:27:45.480
Who's this?

02:27:45.480 --> 02:27:46.480
Hey, it's Rama.

02:27:46.480 --> 02:27:47.480
What's up, everyone?

02:27:47.480 --> 02:27:48.480
Hey, Rama.

02:27:48.480 --> 02:27:49.480
How are you doing?

02:27:49.480 --> 02:27:50.480
We're good.

02:27:50.480 --> 02:27:51.480
How are you?

02:27:51.480 --> 02:27:52.480
I'm good.

02:27:52.480 --> 02:27:53.480
A couple of things.

02:27:53.480 --> 02:27:57.920
Well, I want a reference back to the beginning of the episode about how they're trying to

02:27:57.920 --> 02:28:02.000
pass that little ban on swearing for a week.

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:05.440
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, huh?

02:28:05.440 --> 02:28:06.440
Yeah.

02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:11.120
A few months ago, they tried to do the same thing here in New York, but they tried to

02:28:11.120 --> 02:28:13.840
ban the N-word.

02:28:13.840 --> 02:28:16.520
It didn't get that far.

02:28:16.520 --> 02:28:21.280
You know, and free speech is free speech, so I wouldn't support that.

02:28:21.280 --> 02:28:27.200
But there's a huge difference between the N-word and the F-word.

02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:28.200
You know what I mean?

02:28:28.200 --> 02:28:30.640
Yes, I do.

02:28:30.640 --> 02:28:31.640
There's a huge difference.

02:28:31.640 --> 02:28:35.520
I still think people just shouldn't say the N-word out of good taste.

02:28:35.520 --> 02:28:40.880
Even if we were going to say, you know what, we're going to have our week where we're just

02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:45.840
going to start swearing profusely in protest of this law, and we're going to say every

02:28:45.840 --> 02:28:49.600
dirty word we can think of, and we're going to say fuck, shit, piss, so forth, I still

02:28:49.600 --> 02:28:51.800
wouldn't say that word.

02:28:51.800 --> 02:28:53.120
You know?

02:28:53.120 --> 02:28:54.120
Of course.

02:28:54.120 --> 02:28:59.440
I mean, there are times I find myself saying it by accident, or depending on the company

02:28:59.440 --> 02:29:03.040
that I am with, you know?

02:29:03.040 --> 02:29:06.840
But there are times I do find it a little bit offensive, but half the time I just don't

02:29:06.840 --> 02:29:10.960
care, because it kind of falls into free speech, and it just doesn't bother me at all.

02:29:10.960 --> 02:29:11.960
Right.

02:29:11.960 --> 02:29:16.000
I'm like, you know, and I read a comment from the chatroom, GS68 says, wait, is it not being

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.880
able to say the N-word censorship?

02:29:18.880 --> 02:29:20.680
I guess, yeah, it is.

02:29:20.680 --> 02:29:24.920
But my whole thought is that I just don't want to say that, because there's a big heavy

02:29:24.920 --> 02:29:30.280
weight that comes with saying that word, and a lot of responsibility, like, you know, and

02:29:30.280 --> 02:29:33.120
it's one of those don't write checks your ass can't cash kind of thing.

02:29:33.120 --> 02:29:34.240
Does that make sense?

02:29:34.240 --> 02:29:35.240
You know?

02:29:35.240 --> 02:29:38.980
So if you're going to say a word like that, you better be prepared for the social repercussions

02:29:38.980 --> 02:29:46.960
that come with a very, what's the word I'm looking for, a very emotion-inducing word.

02:29:46.960 --> 02:29:51.760
Well, Chris Rocks, though, said that if it's Christmas Eve, and someone beats you in the

02:29:51.760 --> 02:29:56.000
head when you're trying to buy the last Barbie doll, that you can call them that for, like,

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:57.000
45 minutes.

02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:02.040
Yeah, at four o'clock in the morning, within a two-block radius, yeah.

02:30:02.040 --> 02:30:03.880
And you have to show your receipt.

02:30:03.880 --> 02:30:04.880
Uh-huh.

02:30:04.880 --> 02:30:09.920
Yeah, I actually listened to that very recently, that was funny.

02:30:09.920 --> 02:30:16.440
Excellent from Kitsune in chat, saying the N-word is disrespectful, saying fuck is not,

02:30:16.440 --> 02:30:18.280
unless you call someone a fucker.

02:30:18.280 --> 02:30:21.000
But I call people fucker all the time, I call my husband fucker.

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:24.640
I call people fuckers and motherfuckers all the time, and sometimes it's a term of endearment,

02:30:24.640 --> 02:30:25.640
like bitch.

02:30:25.640 --> 02:30:31.360
Like, God, Jamie, you're such a bitch, but I mean that in positive, you know?

02:30:31.360 --> 02:30:36.760
Back when I was hanging out with a certain somebody, we used to, we actually had a whole

02:30:36.760 --> 02:30:40.800
conversation about that, about how the only people who could use those particular terms

02:30:40.800 --> 02:30:46.600
of the people are the ones that applied to, you know, contextually, you know, and they

02:30:46.600 --> 02:30:49.560
even had a mention of that in the Hebrew Hammer, I thought was absolutely hilarious.

02:30:49.560 --> 02:30:57.000
Um, but, uh, so we used to go around, you know, calling each other, I guess, the H-word.

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:58.000
I'm gonna say it.

02:30:58.000 --> 02:30:59.000
Honky.

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:00.000
Oh, okay.

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:01.000
I was gonna say, what pray tell is the H-word?

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:02.000
Okay.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:03.000
You know, cracker and everything.

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:04.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:07.000
You know, because it was like, okay, well, so they can do it, why can't we?

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:12.360
So we had that conversation, so we just started going around doing it, you know, as, as a

02:31:12.360 --> 02:31:19.000
point of order, you know, it's not, it's not supposed to be insulting when you're the one

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:20.000
doing it.

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:24.120
When it's, it's sort of like you taking it and turning it around.

02:31:24.120 --> 02:31:28.200
At the same time, you know, if someone else came and said that, it'd be like, oh, insult,

02:31:28.200 --> 02:31:29.200
blah, blah, blah.

02:31:29.200 --> 02:31:33.920
You know, but, you know, I, I could go on a whole rant about this.

02:31:33.920 --> 02:31:34.920
I believe it.

02:31:34.920 --> 02:31:37.360
And we'll tie this into video games because you might be sitting there going, what is

02:31:37.360 --> 02:31:40.480
this discussion on language and words have to do with video games?

02:31:40.480 --> 02:31:46.680
Sign on to Xbox Live and play any popular multiplayer game on Xbox Live and you will

02:31:46.680 --> 02:31:51.200
see why this discussion is important because that whole spiel I said about don't write

02:31:51.200 --> 02:31:54.520
checks your ass can't cash when it comes to saying some things.

02:31:54.520 --> 02:31:55.520
Yeah.

02:31:55.520 --> 02:32:01.540
Like some people like to, or love to hide behind that anonymity on Xbox Live and just

02:32:01.540 --> 02:32:06.520
write checks left and right that are going to bounce if you know what I mean.

02:32:06.520 --> 02:32:07.520
Wow.

02:32:07.520 --> 02:32:13.080
So anyhow, Rama, after such a deep conversation, do you have a dick and fart joke or at least

02:32:13.080 --> 02:32:16.800
a video game you've been playing lately?

02:32:16.800 --> 02:32:20.760
Video game, but before I get into it, I just want to know, did you hear me on my keyword?

02:32:20.760 --> 02:32:21.760
No.

02:32:21.760 --> 02:32:22.760
Okay, good.

02:32:22.760 --> 02:32:23.760
Okay.

02:32:23.760 --> 02:32:26.480
Um, no, you're fine.

02:32:26.480 --> 02:32:29.120
I downloaded Blaster Master Overdrive.

02:32:29.120 --> 02:32:30.840
Ah, yes, yes.

02:32:30.840 --> 02:32:32.360
I talked about this a couple of weeks ago.

02:32:32.360 --> 02:32:33.440
What did you think?

02:32:33.440 --> 02:32:34.800
I really liked it.

02:32:34.800 --> 02:32:37.800
Um, my roommate, he's, he's played it.

02:32:37.800 --> 02:32:43.000
He, his main gripe is the fact that in the original NES version, you could jump higher

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.920
with Sophia.

02:32:45.920 --> 02:32:49.140
I didn't even catch that difference, but that's a good one.

02:32:49.140 --> 02:32:50.140
He caught that.

02:32:50.140 --> 02:32:51.960
The controls were what pissed me off.

02:32:51.960 --> 02:32:53.960
That whole straight with the button.

02:32:53.960 --> 02:32:54.960
Ugh.

02:32:54.960 --> 02:32:55.960
Yuck.

02:32:55.960 --> 02:32:58.720
So, but otherwise you liked it?

02:32:58.720 --> 02:33:00.280
Classic controller right there, you know?

02:33:00.280 --> 02:33:01.280
Yeah.

02:33:01.280 --> 02:33:02.280
They needed the classic controller.

02:33:02.280 --> 02:33:06.560
It's just, there were these few little imperfections with the game that needed to be fixed.

02:33:06.560 --> 02:33:09.000
You know what I mean?

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:12.080
But the fact of the matter is we have a sequel.

02:33:12.080 --> 02:33:15.320
I think we're kind of more excited about that than anything else.

02:33:15.320 --> 02:33:16.320
That's true.

02:33:16.320 --> 02:33:17.320
At least it happened.

02:33:17.320 --> 02:33:18.320
Better than nothing.

02:33:18.320 --> 02:33:20.360
All right, Rama, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you

02:33:20.360 --> 02:33:21.360
so much.

02:33:21.360 --> 02:33:22.360
Okay.

02:33:22.360 --> 02:33:23.360
No problem.

02:33:23.360 --> 02:33:24.360
And have fun with Blaster Master and the remixed music.

02:33:24.360 --> 02:33:25.360
That's pretty good.

02:33:25.360 --> 02:33:26.360
All right.

02:33:26.360 --> 02:33:27.360
Later.

02:33:27.360 --> 02:33:28.840
Um, we can probably squeeze in one more call.

02:33:28.840 --> 02:33:32.840
I need to go to Loki though if he's taking a break from the unicorn game and see if there's

02:33:32.840 --> 02:33:33.840
any last minute stories.

02:33:33.840 --> 02:33:34.840
Jamie too, if she has anything.

02:33:34.840 --> 02:33:36.840
No, I'm ranting in the chat room.

02:33:36.840 --> 02:33:37.840
Really?

02:33:37.840 --> 02:33:38.840
Yep.

02:33:38.840 --> 02:33:39.840
Okay.

02:33:39.840 --> 02:33:42.600
Apparently the SRB has revealed yet another Lips game on the way.

02:33:42.600 --> 02:33:49.000
Apparently it's called I Heart the 80s and it will feature such songs including, let's

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:50.000
see here.

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:55.560
That doesn't really say, but they say some of the songs, of course, or lyrics that are

02:33:55.560 --> 02:33:56.560
in there.

02:33:56.560 --> 02:33:57.560
She's a very kinky girl.

02:33:57.560 --> 02:33:59.120
I really need to love.

02:33:59.120 --> 02:34:04.320
I really love to taste her and you don't have to sell your body to the night.

02:34:04.320 --> 02:34:06.200
So I don't even recognize those songs.

02:34:06.200 --> 02:34:08.920
I recognize that she's a very kinky girl.

02:34:08.920 --> 02:34:11.000
I do recognize that one.

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:12.000
That one I recognize.

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:13.800
Let's take a quick call.

02:34:13.800 --> 02:34:14.800
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

02:34:14.800 --> 02:34:15.800
Who's this?

02:34:15.800 --> 02:34:17.120
Good evening.

02:34:17.120 --> 02:34:20.920
You crossed the, uh, supposed like, Oh, what the fuck?

02:34:20.920 --> 02:34:21.920
I'm lost.

02:34:21.920 --> 02:34:22.920
It anyway.

02:34:22.920 --> 02:34:23.920
Hello there.

02:34:23.920 --> 02:34:24.920
Oh Lord.

02:34:24.920 --> 02:34:25.920
This is my kid.

02:34:25.920 --> 02:34:26.920
Hello.

02:34:26.920 --> 02:34:27.920
Hi.

02:34:27.920 --> 02:34:28.920
How are you doing?

02:34:28.920 --> 02:34:29.920
I'm doing just fine.

02:34:29.920 --> 02:34:33.320
Now, what do you think about this whole fact that now we have like a second Swedish listener?

02:34:33.320 --> 02:34:34.800
Are you okay with that?

02:34:34.800 --> 02:34:35.800
What?

02:34:35.800 --> 02:34:36.800
Yeah.

02:34:36.800 --> 02:34:38.800
Did you hear that?

02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:40.840
He called in a couple of weeks ago too.

02:34:40.840 --> 02:34:42.880
We have another guy in Sweden who listens.

02:34:42.880 --> 02:34:44.440
Oh damn.

02:34:44.440 --> 02:34:45.440
Of course.

02:34:45.440 --> 02:34:46.440
I know Sweden's a big place.

02:34:46.440 --> 02:34:47.440
I'd be all like, do you guys know each other?

02:34:47.440 --> 02:34:50.600
But you know, that would be like a little silly because that's like when people ask

02:34:50.600 --> 02:34:55.040
me if I see celebrities, cause I live in California when LA is like eight hours away from here.

02:34:55.040 --> 02:34:58.480
And even when you're in LA, you don't really see celebrities cause celebrities don't really

02:34:58.480 --> 02:35:04.800
like to, you know, they don't really go out in public and shop at, you know, Vons often,

02:35:04.800 --> 02:35:07.160
you know, it's, it's, it's different.

02:35:07.160 --> 02:35:08.800
But anyway, what's on your mind?

02:35:08.800 --> 02:35:09.800
I'm sorry.

02:35:09.800 --> 02:35:10.800
I didn't mean to get on the tangent there.

02:35:10.800 --> 02:35:16.960
Uh, well, what was I gonna, well, I have a question for Jamie actually since, well, uh,

02:35:16.960 --> 02:35:24.880
how would you, if someone, if a Sims 3 player that plays Sims 3 quite a bit would actually

02:35:24.880 --> 02:35:29.280
attempt to try to play Sims 2, how would that feel?

02:35:29.280 --> 02:35:32.000
Wait, wait, wait, say that.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:33.000
Taking a step backwards.

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:40.120
I think like if you're a Sims 3 fan, I've gone back and played Sims 2 and it was fun

02:35:40.120 --> 02:35:44.520
picking up my old games cause there's actually, um, because the mod community, you know, there's

02:35:44.520 --> 02:35:47.720
so much more out for Sims 2, I could do a whole lot more in my games.

02:35:47.720 --> 02:35:50.760
I really enjoy going back to Sims 2 every so often.

02:35:50.760 --> 02:35:55.560
But I, I, I'm, wait Sims 3 is catching up.

02:35:55.560 --> 02:36:03.320
So yeah, well, yeah, because, well, the, because I have been, because the most accurate, the

02:36:03.320 --> 02:36:09.800
most fun I'm having is that since I have the expansion, since I have the World Adventures

02:36:09.800 --> 02:36:19.200
expansion, I have this, I, I, I like having my Sims doing like doing the spar part against

02:36:19.200 --> 02:36:24.280
each other because like the kung fu part is like way entertaining actually.

02:36:24.280 --> 02:36:28.880
I just have to share, I'm looking over at DarkSakra's desk and World Adventures is sitting

02:36:28.880 --> 02:36:33.240
right on the desk under, under one of her knitting projects right there and then high

02:36:33.240 --> 02:36:35.000
end loft stuff is right there too.

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:36.440
Yep, I just got them together.

02:36:36.440 --> 02:36:37.440
Wow.

02:36:37.440 --> 02:36:38.440
It's, I need to re-install everything.

02:36:38.440 --> 02:36:41.440
It's just funny you brought it up cause they're sitting on her desk right now.

02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:44.120
I'll take a picture.

02:36:44.120 --> 02:36:50.920
Speaking of high end, high end loft stuff, do you think it's worth it?

02:36:50.920 --> 02:36:51.920
They're worth it.

02:36:51.920 --> 02:36:59.240
Because I, the problem myself is that, well, because I was found like cheap, found like

02:36:59.240 --> 02:37:10.360
cheap Sims 2, Sims 2 game was that I found like, like the original Sims 2 and a few expansions.

02:37:10.360 --> 02:37:25.840
The expansions for the second part is the animal thing, whatever, the pets and the travel

02:37:25.840 --> 02:37:38.080
parts and the supposed annoying thing is that, well, the expansions in Sims 2 that I'm interested

02:37:38.080 --> 02:37:41.000
of I don't have yet.

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:53.120
Since the expansions that I'm interested in are the year round, the seasons and free time

02:37:53.120 --> 02:38:03.000
because well, at the current, my Sims 3 game I find is a bit boring, but in a way kind

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:12.000
of funny since, well, I like to have my, have my, have my Sims sleeping outside.

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:16.520
Like with, yeah, well I know that for world adventures you've got the tents and everything.

02:38:16.520 --> 02:38:22.320
To be honest, my whole thing with, with Sims 2 was really just building houses, which is

02:38:22.320 --> 02:38:25.220
the same thing I do in Sims 3.

02:38:25.220 --> 02:38:27.160
I love building houses.

02:38:27.160 --> 02:38:29.920
So that's really all I do in it, is just build houses.

02:38:29.920 --> 02:38:31.200
Oh well.

02:38:31.200 --> 02:38:36.680
But I do, if you were looking, if you don't want to pay for, you know, like the high end

02:38:36.680 --> 02:38:40.560
loft stuff, because I mean, I got it because, you know, it was 20 bucks.

02:38:40.560 --> 02:38:41.560
I was there.

02:38:41.560 --> 02:38:43.240
I had the money to blow.

02:38:43.240 --> 02:38:44.760
That's why I got it.

02:38:44.760 --> 02:38:52.360
But if you go to mod the Sims or the Sims resource, you can get all kinds of stuff.

02:38:52.360 --> 02:38:56.640
And if you, you know, if you sort right, you know, for which expansions that you have,

02:38:56.640 --> 02:39:02.000
you can get all kinds of, of just really cool stuff that's all made by, you know, user made

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:03.000
content.

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:07.280
Yeah, but here's the other thing, I don't even know if you can tell me, but I, the only

02:39:07.280 --> 02:39:12.220
thing I want to know in any kind of way is that, well, are there, are the stuff that's

02:39:12.220 --> 02:39:21.360
included in high end loft stuff, are there better, actually a point better than things

02:39:21.360 --> 02:39:27.000
in the original, things that you get, that you get in the expansion or the original game?

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:30.080
Well, I haven't actually got it to run yet.

02:39:30.080 --> 02:39:31.080
Okay.

02:39:31.080 --> 02:39:35.520
Yeah, mine froze, I think because of all the mods I have already installed, because I have

02:39:35.520 --> 02:39:41.120
like the no blur mod, you know, so you can actually see them naked.

02:39:41.120 --> 02:39:44.680
I hate the blur, it just annoys me.

02:39:44.680 --> 02:39:51.000
And I have like, you know, a couple of slider hacks so that I can, you know, change different

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:56.160
parts of the body and I think I might have to reinstall everything to get my games to

02:39:56.160 --> 02:39:57.160
play.

02:39:57.160 --> 02:40:03.560
Well, I have, and I can't, I can't say anything on that because I have, I'm using no mods

02:40:03.560 --> 02:40:07.360
at all, unfortunately.

02:40:07.360 --> 02:40:08.360
So I will.

02:40:08.360 --> 02:40:11.320
Well, maybe she'll, she'll have a better answer for that component in a couple of weeks when

02:40:11.320 --> 02:40:13.960
she gets all that fixed, but kind of going back to the original question, I think that

02:40:13.960 --> 02:40:19.040
the best point that was made by, by Jamie there was the whole point about that if there's

02:40:19.040 --> 02:40:22.600
something you want to go back and kind of experience that was in too, especially with

02:40:22.600 --> 02:40:25.880
all the mods that were done for it and probably a bunch of scenarios that exist out there

02:40:25.880 --> 02:40:28.640
on the internet and so forth, that's really the best way to do it.

02:40:28.640 --> 02:40:30.440
And the fact it's, it's dirt cheap now.

02:40:30.440 --> 02:40:31.440
Yeah.

02:40:31.440 --> 02:40:36.000
You can get the whole Sims Uber collections gotta be really affordable at this point,

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:37.000
right?

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:38.000
I think so.

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.960
I mean, you probably get like, I think they do like whole box sets now, but Aki ripper,

02:40:40.960 --> 02:40:44.640
I say, take it to the extreme, go all the way back and play Sims one.

02:40:44.640 --> 02:40:45.640
Oh no.

02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:52.840
Uh, and I don't think that's possible with my computer since I'm running, uh, running

02:40:52.840 --> 02:40:57.200
64, 64 bits, uh, seven windows seven at the moment.

02:40:57.200 --> 02:40:59.240
So I don't think that's possible.

02:40:59.240 --> 02:41:00.240
All right.

02:41:00.240 --> 02:41:03.080
I can remember we got to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much for

02:41:03.080 --> 02:41:04.080
the call.

02:41:04.080 --> 02:41:05.080
Okay, buddy.

02:41:05.080 --> 02:41:06.080
Oh, later.

02:41:06.080 --> 02:41:07.080
Have fun simming.

02:41:07.080 --> 02:41:08.080
All right.

02:41:08.080 --> 02:41:09.360
Thanks so much guys for the calls tonight.

02:41:09.360 --> 02:41:11.080
Apologies to those that didn't get through.

02:41:11.080 --> 02:41:13.120
Uh, we had a lot of stuff going on tonight though.

02:41:13.120 --> 02:41:17.040
So, uh, again, you can always send us an email and tweets and all that good stuff.

02:41:17.040 --> 02:41:18.040
Please do.

02:41:18.040 --> 02:41:19.480
Uh, many ways to interact with orange launch radio.

02:41:19.480 --> 02:41:20.840
We always appreciate it.

02:41:20.840 --> 02:41:21.840
All right.

02:41:21.840 --> 02:41:24.520
Let's go around and, uh, wrap up any other last minute stories.

02:41:24.520 --> 02:41:26.440
I cut Loki off for that call.

02:41:26.440 --> 02:41:27.440
That's all right.

02:41:27.440 --> 02:41:28.440
Uh, pump it up.

02:41:28.440 --> 02:41:31.800
Fiesta has been unveiled to be coming out March, 2010.

02:41:31.800 --> 02:41:36.800
This is the brand new, um, upgrade for pump it up.

02:41:36.800 --> 02:41:40.320
This would happen to some of the folks behind in the groove are now with like the pump it

02:41:40.320 --> 02:41:41.320
up folks.

02:41:41.320 --> 02:41:42.320
I don't know.

02:41:42.320 --> 02:41:44.400
That's what I thought happened.

02:41:44.400 --> 02:41:50.640
Apparently though, uh, uh, Fiesta will, um, strengthen the intermediate steps for a pump

02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:55.280
lovers, uh, mania and newly improved easy steps for beginners.

02:41:55.280 --> 02:41:59.120
Players also have the option of versus mode in Fiesta.

02:41:59.120 --> 02:42:04.600
Uh, let's see, uh, separated interfaces to better accommodate general players and pump

02:42:04.600 --> 02:42:06.620
lovers from the start.

02:42:06.620 --> 02:42:10.280
Users can play one of the custom made steps by using a USB.

02:42:10.280 --> 02:42:13.060
So custom sets, kind of cool.

02:42:13.060 --> 02:42:19.260
And uh, this is compatible with both a personal USB and pump USB, whatever that I imagine

02:42:19.260 --> 02:42:20.840
they're all about the same anyways.

02:42:20.840 --> 02:42:22.600
Go have a Fiesta with pump it up Fiesta.

02:42:22.600 --> 02:42:26.160
They do have a partial song list out of Siesta.

02:42:26.160 --> 02:42:30.040
I'm trying to see if there's anything other than Banya stuff on here.

02:42:30.040 --> 02:42:37.440
Uh, Oh, good old Banya tons of Banya, uh, Banya production stuff.

02:42:37.440 --> 02:42:42.760
They did a remake of a Turkey March, I guess Turkey that's been in, that's been in pump

02:42:42.760 --> 02:42:43.760
forever.

02:42:43.760 --> 02:42:44.760
Yeah.

02:42:44.760 --> 02:42:48.360
Uh, a lot of remakes and remixes in there.

02:42:48.360 --> 02:42:49.360
That's kinda cool.

02:42:49.360 --> 02:42:51.840
Um, all right.

02:42:51.840 --> 02:42:53.760
And I'm getting corrected in chat.

02:42:53.760 --> 02:42:54.760
That's pump it up.

02:42:54.760 --> 02:43:00.800
Pro says AJ mix and a Y Y R says pump it pro two is not the same thing as Fiesta.

02:43:00.800 --> 02:43:02.840
So I guess there's two different pumps series.

02:43:02.840 --> 02:43:03.840
Okay.

02:43:03.840 --> 02:43:04.840
I kind of lost track.

02:43:04.840 --> 02:43:05.840
Sorry guys.

02:43:05.840 --> 02:43:07.680
Let's go, Oh, he, he, it's the five panel game.

02:43:07.680 --> 02:43:09.800
I that's, that's how much I know of pump.

02:43:09.800 --> 02:43:10.800
Sorry.

02:43:10.800 --> 02:43:11.800
No offense to the community.

02:43:11.800 --> 02:43:16.320
Even though the game just came out last week, a new line cinema has a option, the rights

02:43:16.320 --> 02:43:21.040
for the film adaptation of heavy rain, even though the game plays out pretty much like

02:43:21.040 --> 02:43:31.160
a film anyways, I guess I could see that, uh, and then that's pretty much all I wanted

02:43:31.160 --> 02:43:32.160
to talk about.

02:43:32.160 --> 02:43:33.160
All right.

02:43:33.160 --> 02:43:37.960
Well, that's going to bring us to the close of a show, but not until we go around and

02:43:37.960 --> 02:43:39.240
get everybody's final thought.

02:43:39.240 --> 02:43:43.280
But first let me say a big thank you to everybody of course, for tuning in and supporting orange

02:43:43.280 --> 02:43:45.600
lounge radio and supporting independent podcasting.

02:43:45.600 --> 02:43:48.120
Um, you know, we don't really make any money off the show.

02:43:48.120 --> 02:43:49.320
In fact, we pay to do it.

02:43:49.320 --> 02:43:52.760
Uh, so we do really appreciate all you guys who help us spread the word.

02:43:52.760 --> 02:43:56.240
All we ask, just tell, you know, one or two people about the show and help us spread the

02:43:56.240 --> 02:43:57.240
word.

02:43:57.240 --> 02:44:00.800
And of course we always do love, love, uh, when people post kind reviews of us out on

02:44:00.800 --> 02:44:07.320
the internet, whether it be on, um, uh, iTunes or whether it be on, you know, what are the

02:44:07.320 --> 02:44:10.640
other big sites that are out there, podcast alley or what have you, wherever you choose

02:44:10.640 --> 02:44:11.640
to post it.

02:44:11.640 --> 02:44:12.640
We really appreciate it.

02:44:12.640 --> 02:44:15.760
So thank you guys so much for all the kind words about us on the internet.

02:44:15.760 --> 02:44:16.760
Okay.

02:44:16.760 --> 02:44:18.280
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:44:18.280 --> 02:44:19.760
We'll start with a Loki tonight.

02:44:19.760 --> 02:44:21.560
Loki, what's your final thought.

02:44:21.560 --> 02:44:27.520
I can't wait to go home and install hyper spin 1.0 into my cabinets and finally drop

02:44:27.520 --> 02:44:31.520
down that list of games so I can actually play some stuff.

02:44:31.520 --> 02:44:34.000
My final thought is itchy.

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:35.000
Yes.

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:36.000
Dark Sakura.

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:37.000
Tasty.

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
That's your final thought?

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:40.000
Tasty.

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:41.000
You said itchy.

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:42.000
I said tasty.

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:43.000
All right.

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:44.000
There you go.

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:45.000
Itchy and scratchy.

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:46.000
I know.

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:47.000
I know.

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:48.000
I know.

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:49.000
I know.

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:50.000
And Jill.

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:51.000
Yeah, I get it.

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:52.000
You don't want to end up a Jill sandwich.

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:53.000
Anyhow.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:54.000
Thank you guys so much.

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.520
Uh, we'll be back here next week to do it all again.
