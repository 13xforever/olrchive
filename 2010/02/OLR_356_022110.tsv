0	3000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	13000	Here's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Lowkey
14000	19000	Tonight, February 21st, 2010, Nintendo hits Australian piracy again,
19000	25000	EA is going to shut down more servers, and a recent HD fighting game is being ported to the iPhone.
25000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	35000	Hello my friends on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio,
35000	39000	the video game podcast where every gamer has a voice.
39000	43000	We are live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com
43000	46000	Thanks to the folks at All Games Radio for letting us steal their bandwidth
46000	49000	every week right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, live on Sunday nights.
49000	52000	My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours.
52000	56000	With me is always say hello to my one and only co-host, DarkSakura.
56000	57000	One and only?
57000	59000	Well, you know, one and only sidekick.
59000	62000	I don't know, because I always introduce Lowkey as tech master Lowkey.
62000	64000	He's still a co-host, but that's just the way it is.
64000	65000	You made him spit out his chicken.
65000	67000	I'm sorry. Lowkey knows I love him.
67000	69000	Not in a, you know, no homo.
69000	72000	Isn't that what the rappers say now?
72000	76000	I think I was seeing something the other day where, I don't know, some rappers were talking about,
76000	79000	you know, yeah, yeah, you look really good in that outfit. No homo.
79000	83000	Although I am a homo if you haven't already heard, so whatever.
83000	85000	This show's off to a very strange start already tonight.
85000	87000	It's not just the bandwidth issues, is it?
87000	88000	Yeah.
88000	89000	So anyway, how you doing, DarkSakura?
89000	90000	I'm doing.
90000	91000	All right.
91000	94000	And of course, the one and only tech master Lowkey is here as well.
94000	95000	Hello.
95000	96000	How you doing, Lowkey?
96000	97000	Good.
97000	98000	All right.
98000	101000	So we're gonna be talking video games, of course, over the next few hours with you guys
101000	104000	at our chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
104000	106000	And I want to apologize in advance.
106000	109000	Live radio tonight, I don't know what's going on.
109000	112000	We're having some bandwidth issues in all games, and I think it's kind of why we're off.
112000	114000	It's not all games' fault, though.
114000	116000	They're perfect, because Bobby had a flawless show.
116000	119000	But it's something to do, I think, with Comcast somewhere.
119000	124000	So we're actually starting at 6.15 tonight to give you an idea of how many internet issues we have.
124000	125000	But that's the joy of doing live radio.
125000	131000	I gotta say, there's not a lot of podcasts out there that do it live.
131000	133000	You know, obviously there are several.
133000	136000	But there's not a lot that do the phone calls and all that other stuff.
136000	138000	And that's just part of the fun of it.
138000	141000	You know, I think it's the best way to make sure that every gamer has a voice.
141000	144000	So you have to take the bad with the good, and sometimes there's gonna be bandwidth issues.
144000	145000	All right.
145000	148000	So we also have a special guest here in the studio tonight.
148000	153000	And it's not often we get guests at Studio Dark Sakura, besides Shermy, of course.
153000	156000	But sometimes you have Dan, and I know Tiara's been here before as well.
156000	158000	But tonight we have another special guest.
158000	161000	Say hello, everybody, to Salacious Pop.
161000	162000	Hello.
162000	163000	How are you?
163000	164000	I'm good. How are you?
164000	165000	Good.
165000	169000	Now, it's funny that I was talking about No Homo earlier, because Salacious Pop happens
169000	170000	to be my boyfriend.
170000	171000	That's right.
171000	172000	I brought my boyfriend to the show tonight.
172000	173000	So how are you?
173000	174000	I'm great.
174000	175000	Yes.
175000	179000	So tell the listeners a little bit about yourself and video games, like what you're into.
179000	181000	Like, what kind of video games do you play?
181000	184000	Without telling us about your gaming week, what would you say would be your favorite
184000	187000	video game and the types of stuff you're into?
187000	190000	Music and rhythm games, RPGs, and adventure games.
190000	191000	Yeah?
191000	195000	And what would you say is, like, your favorite video game ever?
195000	196000	Valkyrie Profile.
196000	197000	Yeah?
197000	198000	Why?
198000	201000	The art direction, the story, the multiple endings, and the music.
201000	202000	Gotcha.
202000	205000	What was, like, kind of, how did you get into video games?
205000	207000	Did you get into video games when you were, like, older?
207000	210000	Or was it something you've, like, had a controller in your hand since you were born?
210000	211000	Or what?
211000	215000	I think I got an Atari 2600 when I was about six or seven years old.
215000	220000	And from there I graduated up to the NES and Super NES and played all these Sierra Online
220000	222000	games and that was it.
222000	223000	Very cool.
223000	226000	And, of course, the chat room's chiming in here.
226000	228000	Leachum6 in chat says, does that mean plus homo?
228000	229000	I guess.
229000	230000	I don't know.
230000	231000	Whatever.
231000	234000	We're just, you know what, we like video games.
234000	236000	That's the important thing here.
236000	239000	So, yeah, we're going to talk about video games over the next few hours and the latest
239000	243000	that's going on in video games and news and everything.
243000	244000	I don't know what it is.
244000	245000	Tonight is just an off night.
245000	249000	I don't know if it's, like, the bandwidth or what, but I just feel kind of off and it
249000	251000	has nothing to do with Alan being here.
251000	252000	Or maybe I'm cracking under the pressure.
252000	253000	I don't know.
253000	254000	Is it different being here?
254000	256000	Because you've listened to the show before, obviously, right?
256000	257000	You've commented in chat.
257000	259000	Is it different being here in studio than it is listening?
259000	260000	Absolutely.
260000	261000	How is it different?
261000	263000	Because I'm on live radio.
263000	264000	Because you're on live radio?
264000	265000	Because you get in the middle of the chicken.
265000	266000	And I'm nervous.
266000	267000	You're nervous?
267000	268000	Don't be nervous.
268000	269000	It's fine.
269000	271000	We've gotten away with this crap for some reason.
271000	272000	Dan's in the other room.
272000	273000	I'm nervous.
273000	274000	Yeah.
274000	275000	All right.
275000	276000	Well, don't be nervous.
276000	277000	And even Loki.
277000	278000	Loki seems a little off tonight, too.
278000	279000	What's going on, Loki?
279000	280000	Because I asked Loki a question earlier.
280000	281000	He has malaria.
281000	284000	He got a little bitchy with me.
284000	285000	Loki's not usually the bitchy one.
285000	286000	Dark soccer.
286000	287000	She's the bitchy one.
287000	288000	Loki.
288000	289000	I didn't get bitchy.
289000	290000	I was joking.
290000	291000	You were a little bitchy.
291000	292000	I was joking.
292000	293000	Oh, okay.
293000	296000	Yeah, that's what I tell Dan once a month.
296000	300000	She's like, well, someone didn't give me the stories that I put in there.
300000	302000	I'm like, well, that's too bad.
302000	303000	But here's the thing.
303000	304000	Here's the thing.
304000	305000	It was funny.
305000	306000	Here's the thing the listeners have to know.
306000	311000	Loki, although I know he kind of gets branded as the angry one on the show, because he does
311000	313000	his little rants when it's appropriate.
313000	315000	And he's the angry guy on the show.
315000	319000	He's actually, if you meet him in real life, he's one of the nicest people you'll ever
319000	320000	meet.
320000	321000	Seriously.
321000	322000	I really mean that.
322000	323000	Loki goes out of his way to help people.
323000	327320	He's that guy you can call when your computer's broken or that tech guy everybody knows that
327320	328320	you can call, right?
328320	329320	I'm the angry one.
329320	330320	Yeah.
330320	331320	And Jamie's usually the angry one.
331320	340240	But tonight is weird because Loki was kind of like, well, I don't know, too bad.
340240	343080	And then Jamie's like, I'm going to knit the listeners a sweater.
343080	350040	Well, no, it was just like she wanted to put stories in and I forgot to put them in there.
350040	351960	And I'm like, well, I can't do anything about it now.
351960	352960	It's no big deal.
352960	353960	I don't think anyone cares.
353960	354960	I was trying to be funny.
354960	355960	But it's just funny.
355960	356960	I wasn't like, damn you woman.
356960	357960	Why are you complaining?
357960	360960	I was never like that.
360960	362080	How can I be mad?
362080	363080	I have chicken.
363080	364080	No.
364080	365080	How can anybody be mad?
365080	367360	And Rob brought churro chips.
367360	368360	That's right.
368360	369360	These delicious.
369360	370360	I'm going to endorse these.
370360	371360	They don't pay me, but these chips are delicious.
371360	373080	I think I would like another couple of them, please.
373080	376600	They're Stacy's cinnamon sugar pita chips and they're delicious.
376600	378040	And I bought them at Walgreens.
378040	379040	No, wait, wait, wait.
379040	380040	Get back in here.
380040	382040	Wait, is a Dan approaches?
382040	383040	Put your butt back in here.
383040	384040	Throw the pester ball at Dan.
384040	385040	See if he can catch his attention.
385040	386040	Pester, pester.
386040	387040	Baller, baller, baller, baller, baller, baller.
387040	389040	I guess he didn't want to come in.
389040	390040	All right.
390040	395360	Anyhow, when he hears us saying something that he doesn't agree with, he'll pop in and
395360	396360	let us know.
396360	397360	All right, let's start off.
397360	401360	You can know he's going to stick his head and go, bitches.
401360	403360	All right.
403360	407360	Dan was just trying to say hi to Alan.
407360	408360	All right.
408360	409920	Let's go around and see how everybody's gaming week was.
409920	412480	Usually we start the show with a little bit of how is your gaming week, but tonight we're
412480	413480	broken.
413480	416560	If it's your first time listening, I'm sorry.
416560	419080	If it's your 50th time listening, I'm sorry.
419080	422480	All right, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
422480	427120	It was a lot of Star Trek online because I have a new graphics card, or really I have
427120	430080	someone else's old graphics card, but it's new to me.
430080	432880	In fact, the box of it is sitting right behind you.
432880	433880	It's a-
433880	434880	Indeed.
434880	445000	Oh, it's a GeForce 9800 GTX Plus Black Edition with bells and whistles and crack falling
445000	446000	out of it.
446000	448840	Have you ever clocked it yet?
448840	449840	No.
449840	450840	You should.
450840	452240	We'll see.
452240	454920	Because it's easy and it's extra juice.
454920	455920	We'll see.
455920	456920	Okay.
456920	459960	Why don't you ever clock the card, woman?
459960	462320	Don't you know what you're doing?
462320	463320	Well-
463320	464320	I couldn't-
464320	465320	I've had it.
465320	468800	It went in on Wednesday.
468800	471720	Since then, I've had a friend in the hospital.
471720	472720	I've had homework.
472720	473720	I've had a meeting-
473720	474720	Is your friend okay?
474720	475720	Is this someone I know?
475720	476720	Are they okay?
476720	477720	I don't think he-
477720	480360	I haven't met him.
480360	487440	One of my friends from Temple, he went in with something with his heart.
487440	491200	I'll tell you more offline.
491200	495280	So I went to see him at the hospital, and I've been trying to play Star Trek online
495280	500560	today, but my internet's been kind of-
500560	503920	Every time I would pick a system to go to, it would-
503920	509960	Okay, you know on Ragnarok Online, when you would have a hiccup, and your character would
509960	513920	just suddenly back up a bajillion miles back from wherever you were before?
513920	518240	I understand, but I'll bet you maybe 1% of the listenership understands.
518240	524720	Well, it'd be like, my ship would hiccup, it would backtrack, so you'd actually see
524720	529360	the trails going backwards ahead of the ship, and it would change direction.
529360	531280	And I'm like, what the hell?
531280	537200	So basically your computer was telling you, I can't keep it moving, I don't have the power!
537200	542640	It wasn't even letting- giving me any option to enter the system when I was manually controlling
542640	543640	it to go there.
543640	548080	I was like, well crap, I can't, you know, level, but I started my Klingon the other
548080	550160	night, and that was pretty cool.
550160	551600	I have Klingon now.
551600	552600	So the system was down.
552600	554240	The system is down, dude.
554240	555640	The system is down.
555640	556640	Okay.
556640	561000	I was also playing little clone games on my Linux box.
561000	564920	I was playing, I think it was called like, Penguin Freeze or something, and it's best
564920	567060	to move with penguins.
567060	574000	And they had Connect Four, and I was playing Minesweeper, and the little, you know, just-
574000	576120	Is socially awkward penguin in the game?
576120	578280	I guess.
578280	585440	And then, I was playing Puzzle Bobble in Flash, which is pretty fun.
585440	589360	And that's about it, yeah.
589360	590360	Alright.
590360	592680	And I slept.
592680	593680	Techmaster Loki.
593680	594680	How was your gaming week?
594680	599020	Actually, before I get to that, I should say, some of the people in chat are commenting
599020	602160	on the exchange earlier about the Switching Personalities night.
602160	605040	Sj100matt, go USA in chat.
605040	606360	That's right, it's Olympics time.
606360	611640	Sj100matt says, Loki missed posting stories, but at least he has chicken.
611640	615560	Loki Jenkins.
615560	618160	I just wanted honey barbecue chicken.
618160	619160	Every now and then I get the craving for it.
619160	620760	There's nothing wrong with chicken.
620760	625280	You know, I kind of have a cold right now, so it was the only thing that sounded good.
625280	627840	Chicken and vitamin C. Orange chicken.
627840	628840	Yeah.
628840	630840	Orange chicken, yeah.
630840	633120	There you go.
633120	635760	Let's see, this week, didn't play a whole lot of stuff.
635760	643000	I did put in a good five hours worth of Borderlands though yesterday, so that was fun.
643000	648480	Started doing Mad Moxie's Underdome Riot, and it's very tedious.
648480	654160	Although I did play one round with a friend earlier in the week during lunch, and it was
654160	658280	actually pretty fun co-op, but single player, man, it's pretty boring.
658280	664680	But it was cool, so I played that a little bit, and I'm just kind of working through
664680	665680	Borderlands still.
665680	669560	It's still very fun, and can't wait for the next expansion to come out.
669560	670560	That would be pretty cool.
670560	672880	Although, what a weird level cap though.
672880	676200	They capped it at 61 in the new expansion.
676200	677200	Huh.
677200	679600	I mean, it's like, okay.
679600	684400	Well, maybe there's going to be four more expansions, so it'll be 62, and then 63.
684400	685400	Who knows?
685400	691160	It's still dumb, but 61, okay, that's what you want to stop at, fine with me.
691160	693680	And then, of course, more Grand Theft Auto.
693680	707240	In fact, actually, I want to say that I'm in the top 200 now for cumulative.
707240	711840	I'm not really sure about that, but I know for a fact though, I'm in like the mid 70s
711840	719600	now for true skill rankings, so I'm in the top 75 players in the world, so that's pretty
719600	720600	awesome.
720600	724400	And if one of our listeners wants to serve you a slice of humble pie, how can they do
724400	725400	that?
725400	726400	Just find me online.
726400	732360	We play just ranked games now, so if you happen to be playing a ranked game around 10, 1030-ish,
732360	738560	you know, 3, 330, and then sometime between noon and one, depending on if we're playing
738560	743720	during lunch, you should be able to find us, because there's no one on there.
743720	745080	So it's pretty easy.
745080	751640	We have four systems and we're able to get into ranked games together easy, so...
751640	755600	We're looking for people to play because everybody keeps dropping one when they play with us
755600	758640	because they get pissed off that we kick the crap out of them.
758640	762080	And not that we do it on purpose, I kick the crap out of everybody, including my coworkers,
762080	766740	and they get pissed off too, but, you know.
766740	767740	I don't know.
767740	769520	QQ more.
769520	772040	They make fun of me, they're like, what?
772040	775800	And they'll get ahead or something and they'll be just like, aww, you're just sucking it
775800	781200	up today, blah, blah, blah, I'm like, alright, now I gotta kill you.
781200	785120	See how they go and do that, and now you're just gonna learn the lesson that's involved
785120	789960	with, you know, criticizing my playing.
789960	792280	And that is death.
792280	794560	Lots and lots of death.
794560	796560	In very humiliating ways.
796560	798120	So yeah.
798120	799120	Alright.
799120	802760	My gaming week, not a whole lot to report on.
802760	805000	I moved this week, though, I have a really good excuse.
805000	809120	I have a new place that I'm living at, and I'm still without internet, so not even a
809120	812280	lot of wow this weekend, it's kinda sad.
812280	815960	But I did play a little bit of wow, of course, earlier in the week, I mean, come on, it's
815960	817160	me we're talking about.
817160	820120	I was playing that right up until they unplugged the internet.
820120	825360	And then after that, probably my other big gaming thing was that I actually went to Roseville
825360	829160	Golf Lamb this week, the great place where video games go to die.
829160	832880	Although I have to say, the games I was interested in playing were all working fine, and I did
832880	836400	play lots and lots of BeatMania Distorted, and I was playing the old school songs in
836400	837400	Distorted.
837400	840760	But I know Alan tried playing, like, King of Fighters, or something, what was wrong?
840760	844160	You were playing, what, King of Fighters 98 or something, what were you playing there?
844160	847160	Yeah, it was King of Fighters 2003.
847160	853720	And the first player side had a button missing, and the second player side couldn't move left.
853720	855160	Or forward when you're second player.
855160	859000	So that was a great time.
859000	860760	So it's so easy to fix, too, though.
860760	863000	Imagine trying to play a fighting game without moving forward.
863000	866440	You know, this means photo time again.
866440	871720	But I gotta say, the 2DX machine worked fine, and all the music games actually seemed to
871720	872840	be in really good shape.
872840	874840	You were playing DJ Max Technica.
874840	876240	Yeah, that was working fine, right?
876240	879320	I'm gonna give you an example of how long it's been since I've been there.
879320	885240	They didn't have the 2DX machine set up the last time I was there.
885240	886240	You know what?
886240	888160	Not a lot's changed, I gotta be honest.
888160	891880	It's a lot of ticket redemption machines still, and this is really true of any arcade I could
891880	892880	probably mention.
892880	893880	It's mostly ticket redemption machines.
893880	894880	It's a safe bet.
894880	895880	Yeah.
895880	900960	I did play a little bit, Alan and I sparred on Mario Kart, and it's nothing like Mario
900960	901960	Kart, the home version.
901960	906680	You know, I've been wanting to play the second one, because they have a second GPRK, but
906680	910080	yeah, the GPRK ones are kind of boring, actually.
910080	913360	But hey, port them in the home systems.
913360	914360	Make them playable online.
914360	915360	Oh, wait.
915360	916360	I'm asking too much.
916360	917960	All right, so that was pretty much my gaming week.
917960	921560	Not a lot of exciting stuff, because, you know, without me moving right now, hopefully
921560	922560	I'll have more next week.
922560	925840	I know I will in two weeks, when Final Fantasy XIII's out, so just wait.
925840	926840	Alan, how was your-
926840	928400	It's only two weeks away.
928400	929400	I know.
929400	930400	It's exciting.
930400	931400	It is exciting.
931400	932400	I'm so excited.
932400	933400	All right, Alan, how was your gaming week?
933400	934400	What'd you play?
934400	939200	I played a lot of WoW, because for some reason, you know, someone got me into that.
939200	943120	I don't know who, but yeah, so lots of WoW.
943120	945480	Logged into my City of Heroes characters.
945480	948240	I still play that.
948240	953000	The next expansion, Going Rogue, is actually due out in July.
953000	958920	So I just logged in to, you know, get- refamiliarized myself with my characters.
958920	963240	Played some Gyromancer, the DLC, the extra hard maps.
963240	964240	Now that it works.
964240	967000	Yes, now that it works.
967000	970840	And a Valkyrie profile DS is really what I'm playing right now.
970840	972840	Very cool.
972840	975840	City of Heroes, real quick, because it's not a game we've talked a lot about on the show.
975840	978000	I think we've all kind of, like, dabbled in it a little bit.
978000	980440	I've got the architect addition in my closet.
980440	984720	Like, I know you kind of played it, like, a little bit, but not, like, extensively,
984720	985720	right?
985720	989040	What does City of Heroes have, because you're obviously still playing it while you're juggling
989040	990040	WoW.
990040	994600	What does City of Heroes have for you in an MMO that WoW is lacking?
994600	1001040	The ability to come up with a very strong character concept, and the costume designer
1001040	1004360	is so powerful that you can pretty much have a completely unique character.
1004360	1005360	Oh, I love that.
1005360	1010600	I downloaded that little Korean client that you could just play with all day and not have
1010600	1011600	to even have an account.
1011600	1013840	That was so much fun.
1013840	1017920	And I did notice that when you were showing me your thing, like, how you could, like,
1017920	1020200	go in a phone booth and you'd have, like, the different costumes.
1020200	1022420	You could save, like, five different costume presets.
1022420	1026640	It didn't seem to affect your abilities at all whatsoever, at least that I noticed.
1026640	1027640	I don't know.
1027640	1028640	Maybe it did.
1028640	1030880	And then, like, you had a little bio written on your character, and you'd actually kind
1030880	1034280	of written a whole little thing, and I was thinking, this is like an RP type of player's
1034280	1035280	dream.
1035280	1039080	City of Heroes has an amazing RP community, and I think that's...
1039080	1043160	It's almost a six-year-old game, and for them to be releasing a major expansion six years
1043160	1047000	after the fact, there has to be the money there in the subscriptions, and it's mostly
1047000	1049680	the RP-ers that are sticking around.
1049680	1050680	Six...
1050680	1052760	And WoW's probably been around about five, six years.
1052760	1056320	Well, it just had its fifth anniversary, so it's been around about as long, yeah.
1056320	1060880	Yeah, City of Heroes was huge for the first six or seven months, and then when WoW came
1060880	1069160	out, there was sort of a big vacuum, but it's server population's kind of low, but yeah,
1069160	1070160	there's still a community.
1070160	1071160	Well, a lot of MMOs like that.
1071160	1074840	I mean, Final Fantasy XI, you know, it took a little hit when WoW came out, but I think
1074840	1078200	the audiences for those two games are very different, but I just, I know because I was
1078200	1081040	playing Final Fantasy XI and kind of went back and forth for a little while between
1081040	1083920	that and WoW when it first came out, but there's definitely, you know, there's always gonna
1083920	1087760	be those diehards that just love the game, and I think especially when you bring that
1087760	1091960	RP component into it, you know, I don't know, I mean, Final Fantasy XI had somewhat, you
1091960	1095400	could do, I mean, you could do the RP with any game, but I could see where City of Heroes
1095400	1097280	really let you embrace that, you know.
1097280	1101280	Final Fantasy XI, if you think WoW's limited with how your character can look, Final Fantasy
1101280	1103400	XI's really limiting too, so...
1103400	1110840	Well, I have to say that, you know, the moment I moved on to Star Trek Online, I forgot about
1110840	1113280	World of Warcraft, really, I did.
1113280	1116360	What is it, okay, then let me ask you the same question I asked Alan, what is it about
1116360	1120120	Star Trek Online that had it for you that WoW didn't, or is it just, I know you love
1120120	1122080	Star Trek, is it just the fandom, period?
1122080	1127720	It's really not just the fandom, it's the fact that I really can play by myself, you
1127720	1132900	know, I don't have to, it's annoying as fuck to party with people, really.
1132900	1136480	It's annoying, it pisses me off, I hate doing it.
1136480	1140200	You know, even when it's one of my friends, after like an hour of following behind somebody,
1140200	1142880	I'm like, okay, I'm tired of this, this is monotonous.
1142880	1148400	Whereas in Star Trek Online, it's like when you are doing your instances, you go into
1148400	1152020	an area and you may have three people already there, complete strangers, and you can run
1152020	1156060	through your series of instances together, when you're done with it, that's it.
1156060	1159160	You don't have to really hang out with them, you don't have to follow them around, you
1159160	1161040	can do your own thing.
1161040	1166000	Like I had one person go into one instance, and I went to a completely different one,
1166000	1171680	and we all got, you know, the points for it, because it was still, we were working together.
1171680	1177000	And that's what I like, is it's sort of, it's teamwork, but you can choose if you want to
1177000	1184420	do a fleet mission, and it feels like an episode, it's got enough random in it that it really
1184420	1185860	keeps my interest in it.
1185860	1189680	I will just quickly say this in WoW's defense, is that since you left, they did roll out
1189680	1193440	the Looking for Dungeon tool, which has really helped with a lot of the instancing in that
1193440	1194440	game.
1194440	1195440	That was the one while I was playing it.
1195440	1196440	Oh was it?
1196440	1197440	Yeah.
1197440	1198440	Oh wow.
1198440	1199440	And now they're going to be rolling out, and I don't think it's in our show world this
1199440	1202600	week, I apologize if I'm bumping a story, but Looking for PvP is coming out as well
1202600	1203600	very soon.
1203600	1204600	Nope, you're not.
1204600	1205600	I hate PvP.
1205600	1211880	You know, but I gotta admit, from a WoW standpoint, you know, I realize not everybody's into it,
1211880	1215540	which is cool, but for me, why I like WoW is that it is such a robust game.
1215540	1218800	You know, I can just log in, it's like, oh, I'm gonna just go slip right into a dungeon,
1218800	1222920	or, you know, nobody else is online, maybe I'll go PvP by myself, or hey, Alan's online,
1222920	1225440	we're gonna go quest together, and it's like we're hanging out, but we're not, because
1225440	1226440	we're nerds.
1226440	1231240	I totally don't mind, though, doing PvP, though, if I get to smash some Klingons in the face.
1231240	1235760	I just can't wait until we get Romulan and Cardassian missions.
1235760	1236880	Is that like a future expansion?
1236880	1239440	Yeah, I think that's gonna be a future thing.
1239440	1245280	I will play some more Star Trek online, but see, there's this big thing kind of hovering
1245280	1251600	in the distance, and that is Final Fantasy XIV, and I just know, like, I have to play
1251600	1252600	it.
1252600	1256600	I have to, I've sucked three years, I mean, if you guys think I talk about WoW a lot,
1256600	1261480	you should have been on the show three, four years ago, like, do you remember when we used
1261480	1263200	to talk about the fairy server?
1263200	1265080	I mean, that's old school, okay?
1265080	1266080	I used to play with you.
1266080	1269300	I don't, we used to talk, I mean, I used to just talk about Final Fantasy XI all the
1269300	1273780	freaking time on the show, so, I mean, I have to try XIV, just because I sunk so much time
1273780	1274780	into XI.
1274780	1278980	I mean, I gave XI a really good try, I mean, you were here watching me play, doing the
1278980	1280640	freaking macros on my controller.
1280640	1283440	But if you hate grouping with people, XI stinks.
1283440	1284440	It does.
1284440	1287600	I mean, XI is about forced, the enemy?
1287600	1288600	It is forced grouping.
1288600	1292120	To be fair, they fixed a lot of that, like, years later, like, after I left with the level
1292120	1294160	sink and everything, but, you know.
1294160	1298800	Well, you know, my big problem with that one is just that, you know, maybe it was just
1298800	1302500	because I was playing the White Mage, maybe it was because I was the party bitch.
1302500	1308800	You know, it finally, and I've told the story before, the final straw for that game was
1308800	1313040	me calling everybody over with my little dinky, okay, I will go back, actually, playing with
1313040	1315360	Japanese players is not annoying.
1315360	1317360	They know how to party.
1317360	1318360	If you know what I mean.
1318360	1319880	They're the only ones that would respect a bard.
1319880	1323400	That's right, I remember when you tried to play a bard.
1323400	1328940	Dude, I was a pimp-ass bard, but, you know, just no one wanted to play the bard, I rocked
1328940	1329940	the bard.
1329940	1337860	And if you would, see, here's your proof, angry Loki, when you talk about, you know,
1337860	1341040	some of the hacking and the stuff, he gets angry Loki.
1341040	1344180	I rocked the bard.
1344180	1346240	But then, what angry man says that?
1346240	1349900	But remember, you can also swap out the music and stuff in there, because there was that
1349900	1354680	little trick you could do, and so I would have, like, smack my bitch up to, like, the
1354680	1355680	battle music.
1355680	1356680	It was awesome.
1356680	1360160	Dude, I remember when you would mount up on the chocobo, and it would play the theme from
1360160	1361760	the Neverending Story.
1361760	1363760	Oh, yeah?
1363760	1365600	Oh, yes.
1365600	1368120	Oh, that's fun.
1368120	1371800	Well, what my story was, as I was saying.
1371800	1372800	Sorry.
1372800	1373800	It's okay.
1373800	1374800	No, I think that's funny.
1374800	1375800	It was worth it.
1375800	1376800	Smack my bitch up.
1376800	1379600	Anyway, so my little character, you know, because when you throw out your macros, you
1379600	1384160	can call everyone in your party to come back to you so that you can do an area effect buff.
1384160	1389840	And I was finally, like, I did the buff, everything, then this one guy comes in, hey, I'm in the
1389840	1390840	buff.
1390840	1393840	I'm like, fuck you, log out.
1393840	1394840	And that was it.
1394840	1395840	I never played again.
1395840	1396840	All right.
1396840	1402960	I totally remember, I totally forgot about Falkor's Ride or whatever it said to the chocobo,
1402960	1405000	but it was awesome.
1405000	1407020	It was very epic.
1407020	1409840	This was when Loki and I lived together, and, like, we had our computers, like, kind of,
1409840	1411840	like, right next to each other, like, they're here in the studio.
1411840	1415040	So, you know, I'd be doing my thing in Final Fantasy XI, and then, like, I'm like, okay,
1415040	1418260	because, you know, Loki and I would play together sometimes because we're nerds, right?
1418260	1422200	And I'd say, like, okay, Loki, come meet me in Altepa Desert and let's party.
1422200	1425160	Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
1425160	1429400	And, like, Loki's fanfare is, like, coming from the computer.
1429400	1430400	And then I'll say...
1430400	1431400	Bring your harp.
1431400	1432400	No, then I'll...
1432400	1437600	I did that, though, with Ragnarok for a little while, because it's all MP3s, so you could
1437600	1438600	change out the music.
1438600	1442600	So, I remember going into...
1442600	1447400	It was this one place that used to have this big, epic music, and it was, like, instead
1447400	1450160	it was a bassoon quartet.
1450160	1451160	There was another one.
1451160	1453320	The group party music that I had was...
1453320	1455120	The battle music was the theme...
1455120	1459800	It wasn't the theme of Zanarkand or whatever, but it's from Final Fantasy XI.
1459800	1461960	It was the jacked, angry music.
1461960	1462960	I remember that.
1462960	1463960	Otherworld.
1463960	1465960	Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
1465960	1466960	Otherworld.
1466960	1467960	It was awesome.
1467960	1471560	And Final Fantasy X, I remember it from your frickin', like, every time.
1471560	1475320	Because I was a healer, so I never really engaged the monster, but, like, you know,
1475320	1476320	when you...
1476320	1479720	I think you finally started Black Mage instead of Bard, and, you know, we'd be fighting,
1479720	1485920	you know, the killer level 60 rabbit or whatever, and then, like, okay, engage the rabbit.
1485920	1487920	Doo doo doo doo doo doo.
1487920	1490440	Like you just had the most epic bunny killing music I've ever heard in my life.
1490440	1495080	I just hope that's the only thing that they include from Final Fantasy XI in XIV, is the
1495080	1496320	ability to change the music out.
1496320	1498040	You're not supposed to be able to do that.
1498040	1499040	You just like to hack things.
1499040	1500040	Oh, who cares?
1500040	1501040	Yes.
1501040	1502040	All right.
1502040	1505560	Anyhow, boy, we're not even, like, into the gaming news yet.
1505560	1506560	Hey.
1506560	1507560	You know what?
1507560	1509120	If I was gonna do that, then my battle music would be bitches.
1509120	1513240	I mean, mindless self-indulgence.
1513240	1514400	I don't know what mine would be.
1514400	1516920	What would be some good battle music for me, Alan?
1516920	1517920	I'm trying to think.
1517920	1519720	For Final Fantasy XIV, if I could hack the music.
1519720	1521720	What are you guys talking about?
1521720	1525800	Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
1525800	1526800	Anyhow.
1526800	1531680	Actually, Shaoran in the chat room, I hope I pronounced that right, chat.orange.radio.com
1531680	1536000	says, has a suggestion, if Star Trek Online had a customizable music, OLR would need to
1536000	1538760	bring in, I'm on a boat.
1538760	1544720	I would totally do that for the, you know how they have the fairies you could take?
1544720	1550520	Oh yeah, I remember the first time taking a fairy in Final Fantasy XI.
1550520	1553720	Like I got on the little fairy, cause like, you know, getting around in Final Fantasy
1553720	1554720	XI kind of sucks.
1554720	1557080	It takes like 30 minutes to get from one thing to the other.
1557080	1558080	So you'd get on the boat.
1558080	1561480	I remember the first time I ever took a boat ride, you know, it's like, doo doo doo doo
1561480	1562480	doo doo doo doo doo.
1562480	1563480	You know, happy little boat music.
1563480	1566840	And then all of a sudden it gets really dark, doo doo doo doo doo.
1566840	1570640	We fricking got raided by pirates the first time I ever rode a boat in the game.
1570640	1574240	And now, but I, I remember that being an epic moment of Final Fantasy XI.
1574240	1577060	I was like, that was actually really cool that the boats will randomly get raided by
1577060	1578060	pirates.
1578060	1582000	And like, I would, you would have to, as a low level character, literally run and hide
1582000	1583000	in the basement.
1583000	1586800	I think I had to, cause you like, you came and got me one time.
1586800	1591640	Well, someone dragged a Kraken down the stairs.
1591640	1596560	Anyhow, I have to say though, I still, to this day, remember the look on your face when
1596560	1598600	I was doing my macros on my controller.
1598600	1602120	I was very impressed with the way you were doing the, but, but then I couldn't, that's
1602120	1603120	what I hated in World of Warcraft.
1603120	1604840	I couldn't use my damn controller.
1604840	1609280	Final Fantasy XI was built for the PS2, you know, and I have to remember losing controller.
1609280	1611120	That's the way most of the Japanese players do it now.
1611120	1615000	And some American ones as well, obviously, but I cannot imagine that game without a computer
1615000	1616000	keyboard.
1616000	1617000	Anyway.
1617000	1618000	I agree with Rama.
1618000	1619200	When did this become Final Fantasy Radio?
1619200	1620200	I don't know.
1620200	1621200	So let's move on.
1621200	1624720	Let's get into some housekeeping tonight and talk a little bit about what's going on with
1624720	1629600	OLR before we get into the gaming news tonight.
1629600	1635020	I don't have a whole lot of show specific news besides, don't forget that you can always
1635020	1637000	join us on our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
1637000	1638840	And of course we're on Facebook as well.
1638840	1643720	Orange Lounge Radio there, Addis is your friend and we will usually make updates except tonight
1643720	1646920	because with all the internet hiccup we had earlier, we didn't get onto many of the social
1646920	1652360	networking, but also, uh, we got a voicemail from Breslul and he wants to update you guys
1652360	1656560	on usl madness and what is going on there in our forums.
1656560	1661920	So I want to go to the voicemail and oh, did I delete it?
1661920	1662920	I hope not.
1662920	1663920	Oops.
1663920	1666760	When we did the reboot earlier, I might've deleted his voicemail.
1666760	1667760	Whoopsie.
1667760	1670200	Let's see if I can get to it here.
1670200	1671200	And here we go.
1671200	1672200	Here's his voicemail.
1672200	1675280	Here's a voicemail from Breslul about what is going on in usl madness at our forums at
1675280	1676280	orange launch radio.com.
1676280	1685360	Hello Orange Lounge Radio, it's Breslul once again, reminding you and the listeners to give
1685360	1688240	us some votes here on usl madness.
1688240	1691440	We have some fantastic match-ups in the round of 32.
1691440	1694960	We've got a heated one between Final Fantasy 7 and Pokemon.
1694960	1699280	Mega Man 2 is facing Mega Man 3, one of the most bizarre match-ups of the tournament.
1699280	1703120	Ocarina of Timers and Tecmo Super Bowl, Earthbound vs Secret of Mana.
1703120	1706080	I could go on, but there's not enough time in the show.
1706080	1711040	But please visit our forums, get yourself an account and vote today because half of
1711040	1717400	these games go away and then next week is the sweet 16 where things get incredibly interesting.
1717400	1720880	Once again, log on to our forums and vote.
1720880	1728120	We'll talk to you later and usl will be back on the, let me try that again, usl will be
1728120	1731800	back on February 27th.
1731800	1732800	We'll see you then.
1732800	1733800	Till then.
1733800	1740120	Now that was Breslul from Understation Live, Saturday nights at All Games Radio, allgamesradio.com
1740120	1745000	or if you want just the radio feed, it's allgamesradio.com and they'll be back on Saturday.
1745000	1749160	But yeah, Breslul and Travis, they team up with us to do this usl madness, which is kind
1749160	1752360	of like a take on March Madness, if you don't know what it is, where they try to define
1752360	1757160	the greatest video game of all time and everybody submits their list and then he seeds it like
1757160	1758640	it was basketball games.
1758640	1760440	And Guardian Legend wins.
1760440	1763520	Guardian Legend wasn't even like in the top 64 on people's list.
1763520	1764520	It was on my list.
1764520	1768000	I had it in my top 25 games of all time, but I guess that wasn't enough because admittedly
1768000	1770400	it wasn't number one, sorry Jamie.
1770400	1773520	But there's, yeah, as he said in the voicemail, there's some pretty epic match-ups going on
1773520	1774520	right now.
1774520	1777440	Like Mega Man 2 versus Mega Man 3, how do you even decide between those two games?
1777440	1779720	Like it's practically the same guy.
1779720	1780840	I said two as well.
1780840	1782800	What is it that draws you to two over three though?
1782800	1783800	Do you think?
1783800	1787600	I like the number two better than three.
1787600	1789720	Bubble Man stage music.
1789720	1791320	Metal blades.
1791320	1795160	I think it's just the fact that, well for me and the way I rationalized it when I voted
1795160	1798520	on the forums was that Mega Man 2 was kind of set the bar.
1798520	1802960	Like obviously Mega Man 1 was the original, but you know, it had all these things like
1802960	1806600	scoring and less bosses and kind of a different interface and everything.
1806600	1810760	Mega Man 2 kind of really polished that and really Mega Man 3 is just Mega Man 2 with
1810760	1812920	some new thrills in it.
1812920	1817920	But Mega Man 2 was so important that those bosses came back in three.
1817920	1822120	Mega Man 2 was one of my, I'd have to say my big accomplishments because I used to be
1822120	1823640	able to do the dragon level blindfolded.
1823640	1826640	I remember, I remember you telling me about that and I used to be able to play that game
1826640	1828440	like, you know, through in one sitting too.
1828440	1831120	Because that level has like, it's all about timing with that level.
1831120	1833520	The only other, like I said, the only other game I've been able to do that with is World
1833520	1835160	8-1 and Super Mario Brothers.
1835160	1836160	Nice.
1836160	1837160	Very cool.
1837160	1840040	Yeah, so I don't know, it's just something about, I mean not that Mega Man 3 is a bad
1840040	1843720	game by any means, but that's the tough thing about March Madness is you have to sometimes
1843720	1844720	look at two good games.
1844720	1846040	Now here's the other interesting one.
1846040	1849160	There's Final Fantasy 7 versus Pokemon going on right now.
1849160	1854160	And I notice there's interesting, Pokemon is winning as of the time of the show.
1854160	1858520	Final Fantasy 7 is, it seems like a lot of the vote isn't, I mean I could be wrong, but
1858520	1863420	there's a lot of vote that is not for Pokemon so much as it is against Final Fantasy 7 because
1863420	1864420	of all the fanboy wank.
1864420	1868520	And I was trying to figure out why that is because I don't think Final Fantasy 7 is the
1868520	1874480	best Final Fantasy, but certainly like, it was the game that got me to buy a Playstation.
1874480	1875480	It was, you know.
1875480	1878080	I owned that game before, I had a Playstation.
1878080	1879080	How does that work?
1879080	1880080	My roommate had one.
1880080	1881080	Oh.
1881080	1885840	And yeah, you know, I just remember it just changed the way you kind of perceive Final
1885840	1889000	Fantasy games because it was so different from the sprite based ones.
1889000	1895120	But I agree the fan wank got a little crazy, but I can't hold that against the game.
1895120	1899880	But I don't know, but then you look at a series like Pokemon and that's like a cult.
1899880	1904760	That's like, I don't even know, like Pokemon sucks people in and doesn't let them go.
1904760	1905760	It's like.
1905760	1906760	I don't get it.
1906760	1907760	Yeah.
1907760	1908760	I don't know.
1908760	1909760	But yeah, whatever.
1909760	1910980	I can't be mad I guess.
1910980	1911980	That's what happens.
1911980	1915000	Every gamer has a voice even when that voice is whack.
1915000	1919480	Www dot orange lounge radio.com no disrespect to the Pokemon fans.
1919480	1924160	I just, I, to me, they're kind of all the same game.
1924160	1926000	Like I are all the same game.
1926000	1927000	Look.
1927000	1928000	Oh my God.
1928000	1932320	We discovered new Pokemon that are no way similar to the other Pokemon.
1932320	1933320	Buy more games.
1933320	1934320	All right.
1934320	1935600	Before you send in the hate mail though.
1935600	1937320	I was there when the first movie came out in theaters.
1937320	1938320	I went and saw it opening night.
1938320	1939320	Okay.
1939320	1940320	So I think I went with you.
1940320	1941320	Didn't I?
1941320	1942320	No, I went Chico.
1942320	1943320	No, that's right.
1943320	1944700	Because I, I got the important.
1944700	1947640	You might've went to the second one with me because I went and saw the second one too.
1947640	1952280	I saw the third one with you at the theater probably, but I had, but I had to import a
1952280	1956120	copy of the, of the Japanese one.
1956120	1957440	So yeah, don't send in the hate mail.
1957440	1958600	I Pokemon's fine.
1958600	1961840	I just, I, where are they going to go with it?
1961840	1967540	It's just, I, if they just make more Pokemon, if they made an MMO, I try it.
1967540	1968540	I would.
1968540	1969540	And then they have the record.
1969540	1970800	I still think Digimon's cooler.
1970800	1972840	All right, let's get into some gaming news.
1972840	1975880	We're like what, 30 minutes in the show after a 15 minute late start, we haven't even covered
1975880	1976880	news yet.
1976880	1979880	This is going to be a 10 o'clock at night show.
1979880	1980880	Let's see what happens.
1980880	1981880	That's 1am for you East coasters.
1981880	1983640	Let's get started on some gaming news.
1983640	1984640	Loki.
1984640	1985640	Okay.
1985640	1990680	So, um, the ESA did a survey, um, or I shouldn't really say a survey, but they did research
1990680	1994740	focusing on 200 specific titles during the month of December.
1994740	1998280	Not necessarily stuff that came out in December, but just during that month.
1998280	2008640	And it showed that of those 200 titles, there were 9.78 million illegal downloads for those
2008640	2011400	titles during the month of December.
2011400	2017200	And the, uh, you might think, okay, well maybe the U.S. is, you know, to blame because there's
2017200	2018920	a lot of people in the U.S. at pirate.
2018920	2023200	But actually, no, there's other countries that were a lot higher.
2023200	2030720	In fact, um, the highest number of unauthorized downloads came from Italy with 20.3% of the
2030720	2031720	total.
2031720	2040200	Spain, following that with a 12.5%, France with 7.5% and China with 5.7%.
2040200	2041200	Interesting.
2041200	2043200	Now, okay.
2043200	2047160	I know there might be more to that story, so I apologize for interrupting you, but um,
2047160	2050880	you know, when I hear the news about the piracy and the numbers, I don't think the, of the
2050880	2051880	U.S. is number one.
2051880	2055960	I think a lot of people think, oh, that's all in the U.S. or whatever, but no, I, but
2055960	2057180	I blame Luxembourg.
2057180	2059800	The countries I think of are not the ones you're naming.
2059800	2064440	Like I usually think, you know, because of the stereotypes about being able to buy bootlegs
2064440	2068800	in Hong Kong, like right on the street corners and you know, knowing of all that that goes
2068800	2071340	on, I would think it's like Hong Kong, Taiwan.
2071340	2075360	Those would be the types of places that would be the tops for piracy, but Italy?
2075360	2080600	Now pardon my ignorance for those overseas listeners, but I've never even been over to
2080600	2081840	the other side of the Atlantic.
2081840	2082840	So sorry.
2082840	2086000	I know we have a lot of listeners over there cause we try to let every gamer have a voice,
2086000	2088120	including our friends from overseas.
2088120	2092160	But is there something about Italy where like the distribution that gets to the rest of
2092160	2094160	Europe doesn't get there or something?
2094160	2095160	I have no idea.
2095160	2100060	Um, but they said also that of that, you know, those 10 million, those aren't even really
2100060	2103400	a full picture of, you know, what's being downloaded.
2103400	2106540	I think it's just all modern warfare too.
2106540	2107540	It's probably what it was.
2107540	2111720	Well, cause my thought is, you know, is that I've gotten into this topic before and I don't
2111720	2116040	know if it was on a call with Bobby show at the end or if it was on this show, but um,
2116040	2120960	that I think a lot of this piracy comes from folks that can't get the game through legal
2120960	2123040	means turn to piracy.
2123040	2127840	And that's why I kind of question, well, does Italy get game releases when the rest of,
2127840	2129780	you know, those countries over there get them?
2129780	2134160	Or is there something about Italy where, and Spain and some of those other countries you
2134160	2138740	named where they don't get the games at the same time so people turn to piracy?
2138740	2142920	Like are there laws where maybe the game has to be in a local language like Italian or
2142920	2144240	Spanish so they can't release them there?
2144240	2145240	I don't know.
2145240	2146240	I don't know.
2146240	2151600	I don't really hear a lot of just, um, you know, I don't really hear of anything being
2151600	2153480	delayed there, but I mean, I don't really know.
2153480	2157720	We never hear like, you know, Italy's not getting the game cause it's been censored
2157720	2158720	or something like that.
2158720	2161560	It's always Germany or New Zealand or Australia.
2161560	2162960	They gotta catch them all.
2162960	2166240	Well, I would love to hear from a listener and you know, cause I know we have some listeners
2166240	2167240	over there.
2167240	2169680	If you're listening and you're in one of those countries, Loki named, I would love to get
2169680	2171240	an email from you.
2171240	2173760	Why do you think piracy is so rampant where you live?
2173760	2177640	I mean, is the legal just difficult or expensive or what?
2177640	2180360	Cause I think, I don't know.
2180360	2182500	Why do people turn to piracy in the US?
2182500	2185520	Because they blame the $60 price point of a console game.
2185520	2189880	You know, I'm, I'm too poor, I'm a, I'm a starving student or whatever it is, you know,
2189880	2195080	try to justify it with, you know, the whole Robin Hood philosophy of steal from the rich
2195080	2196120	and give to the poor.
2196120	2198680	That's what motivates most piracy.
2198680	2201080	You know, I'm not saying a good thing about that.
2201080	2202740	I'm just, I'm just saying what I see.
2202740	2203960	That's just kind of what it seems to be.
2203960	2205840	It's, it's the whole Robin Hood approach.
2205840	2209160	So anyhow, uh, well be careful.
2209160	2212760	I don't think it's as altruistic as Robin Hood's intent.
2212760	2214880	It's rob from the rich and give to me.
2214880	2215880	Okay.
2215880	2216880	Fair enough.
2216880	2217880	All right.
2217880	2220600	Well, speaking of piracy, you might want to be a little bit careful if you're into that.
2220600	2224800	Keep in mind, you know, piracy is not legal, just a reminder, you know, so you are walking
2224800	2226240	a dangerous line.
2226240	2229960	Um, so that is evidenced by what's going on in Australia right now.
2229960	2233480	In fact, when I first read this story, I was like, Oh, what is this?
2233480	2237080	This is, do we already read about this last week when some pirate got busted in Australia?
2237080	2239040	No, this is something else.
2239040	2244560	Nintendo is actually managed to win a case against the R4 mod cartridge for the DS.
2244560	2248400	What happened is that Nintendo actually won a lawsuit against, uh, the Australian distributor
2248400	2249400	of the R4.
2249400	2251880	Uh, this is coming from the news lines in Australia.
2251880	2257320	Uh, apparently gadget gear.com.au cause all the Australian ones in today, you, they were
2257320	2259560	actually told they have to stop selling the device.
2259560	2267320	They got fined the equivalent of $466,000, uh, the folks that were named in the suit,
2267320	2272400	Patrick Lee and James Lee, I guess they also kind of sold this independently, not through
2272400	2273400	the same site.
2273400	2277760	Uh, but they also were fined $100,000 Australian.
2277760	2279920	That's about 90,000 here.
2279920	2282960	Also what I think is interesting is part of the settlement or I'm sorry, not settlement,
2282960	2283960	but suit.
2283960	2287400	Uh, they have to disclose who is supplying the R4 chips.
2287400	2288400	Hmm.
2288400	2293640	So that again is just, that's the second in like a week's time of Nintendo winning some
2293640	2294640	anti-piracy.
2294640	2295640	I think it's dumb.
2295640	2301680	The, you know, I mean those chips, I understand that they can be used for piracy, but a computer
2301680	2303020	can be used for piracy.
2303020	2306320	So yeah, we're going to make computers legal now too.
2306320	2311160	I mean it's just, you have to go after the, sadly enough, you have to go after the people
2311160	2315080	that are using the pirate stuff or I don't know, here's a thought.
2315080	2317120	Go after people putting ROMs online.
2317120	2323000	It won't matter if you have the stupid chip for your DS because it won't work with anything.
2323000	2326060	There's no fucking ROMs out there.
2326060	2330600	Oddly enough, I kind of agree with you and I think your computer analogy, you know, even
2330600	2335120	though I don't own an R4 and I don't think I would get into all this stuff, I have two
2335120	2336120	and a G3.
2336120	2338200	I have two Ninja passes.
2338200	2343560	I think, okay, I think, you know, I, I'm, I feel like I'm too stupid to really get into
2343560	2344560	all that stuff.
2344560	2347760	I don't know what it is, but I think if I had one, I'd want to play like homebrew stuff
2347760	2350040	on it is probably what I would be into.
2350040	2353760	You know, I, I like having the real deal because then I know I'm going to get online and not
2353760	2356560	get my system bricked and you know, all of that, like I'm willing to pay the extra money
2356560	2359880	just for ease of mind in that regard.
2359880	2365320	But as far as like the R4 stuff goes, I think when you buy a device like that, yeah, I should
2365320	2368960	be able to use the parts for whatever I want.
2368960	2371580	As long as I'm not stealing, I get the problem with piracy.
2371580	2375880	You're stealing someone else's property like, you know, that they spent money to create
2375880	2376880	the wrong people.
2376880	2382120	But if somebody wants to put a free ROM on the internet for their free public domain,
2382120	2385840	just like somebody puts their music up on MySpace, they want you to download it and
2385840	2388280	listen to it to get their band name out there.
2388280	2394260	It's just like people, it'd be going after, it'd be like going after somebody, um, or
2394260	2400120	a camcorder company because somebody used it to pirate a film.
2400120	2406120	You can't do that just because it's a device that allows you to run unauthorized stuff.
2406120	2410560	I guess they could just, you know, stop the, you know, ban them from manufacturing it or
2410560	2411760	they could try.
2411760	2415120	But if it's unauthorized in the first place and there's not a lot you can do to lock it
2415120	2420520	out since they can't really update the hardware to do that, um, via firmware or anything.
2420520	2428080	But um, I don't know, I mean it, there are a lot of legitimate uses for it besides piracy.
2428080	2433520	For the record, I haven't used mine to play anything in months because I just don't care
2433520	2434520	anymore.
2434520	2436160	I have to admit, I'm kind of in the same boat.
2436160	2439480	Like even when I was moving this weekend, I found just like tons and tons of DS and
2439480	2440480	PSP games.
2440480	2444320	I'm like, I don't even remember the last time I touched these cause, but if you've listened
2444320	2447400	to the show before, you know, I have this weird thing against handheld gaming.
2447400	2450280	Like I just can't, games are meant for my television.
2450280	2452280	Like I can't play them sitting there.
2452280	2458760	I feel, I don't know, dirty, not dirty, and there's been some really good handheld games
2458760	2459760	too.
2459760	2462720	Like Final Fantasy four on the DS loved it, you know, and yeah, there's non Final Fantasy
2462720	2463720	games too, you know?
2463720	2470400	Well, I, the last thing I was playing was, um, the Zelda, um, spirit tracks, but I even
2470400	2472040	got bored of that.
2472040	2474000	I shouldn't be getting bored of a Zelda game.
2474000	2477500	I mean, come on, it's Zelda, it's awesome.
2477500	2483200	Do you think maybe your expectations have kind of no, but they didn't really do that
2483200	2488120	much different other than look now, now links right in a train instead of a boat.
2488120	2489760	I mean, it's the same damn game.
2489760	2490760	Okay.
2490760	2493660	I'm going to take the tangent train for a minute here, but like we kind of got into
2493660	2494920	it a couple of weeks ago on the show.
2494920	2499200	I remember talking about game room and some of these old arcade games and Atari 2,600
2499200	2502580	games and some folks saying that, you know, they're repetitive, they're boring.
2502580	2506500	And I'm thinking that's what it was all about back when you know, those games first came
2506500	2507500	out.
2507500	2508500	What's wrong with you?
2508500	2513320	You know, like, are we just, have our expectations about what makes a good game like changed
2513320	2514320	in that regard?
2514320	2518480	I guess they have to some extent, you know, it would be like this.
2518480	2524300	It would be like saying, okay, um, I'm playing Pac-Man Pac-Man's cool.
2524300	2527820	And then we come out with Pac-Man two, which is exactly the same as Pac-Man one, except
2527820	2531720	now the screen is blue and purple instead of like yellow and blue.
2531720	2536480	That's basically the difference between, you know, Ms. Pac-Man, but she has a bone.
2536480	2541480	She has a bow and you know, it's slightly different, but no, seriously, it's, it's almost
2541480	2545240	like they've said, okay, well, what can we do to put the least amount of effort into
2545240	2548340	this so we can release a sequel really quick?
2548340	2549340	And yes, I understand.
2549340	2553880	Ooh, it's, I mean, they don't even try to tie any of the games storyline wise together.
2553880	2560480	Oh yes, it's another adventurer who happens to look the same as Link and his name is Link.
2560480	2564880	And now, uh, he has got to go rescue this Princess Zelda, who's not the same Princess
2564880	2567940	Zelda, even though she looked exactly the same as the last game.
2567940	2570700	Don't they do that in all the Zelda games?
2570700	2574340	Like aren't all the links like different links, but there could, I mean, sometimes they're
2574340	2576400	the same link depending on what game you're playing.
2576400	2579520	It's just, it's, it's lazy is what it is.
2579520	2581580	It's like, oh, let's, I thought that's why the name was Link.
2581580	2585860	Cause they're all linked from my just dumb.
2585860	2587500	I don't think that's why.
2587500	2589500	All right, fine.
2589500	2593860	All right, let's move on with some other gaming news before I take the tangent train somewhere
2593860	2594860	else.
2594860	2596700	Do you have a news story to save us here a little bit?
2596700	2597700	I do.
2597700	2599580	I'm, I'm tangled up in yarn.
2599580	2600580	No.
2600580	2609660	Um, there is a bit more about, uh, EA, um, servers being a big clank putting on them.
2609660	2617260	On March 16th, we have, um, service shut down for death jam for PS3, Godfather for PS3 and
2617260	2624140	Xbox 360, Lord of the Rings conquest, Mercenaries 2, need for speed carbon on portable, um,
2624140	2630460	need for speed, um, pro street PSP, Simpsons, um, for PlayStation three and Xbox 360, April
2630460	2636420	15th, burnout three take down, um, army of two for PS3, but that's only in Asia.
2636420	2643100	And then, um, of course we have a ton of original Xbox being shut down after that and PS2 games.
2643100	2650060	So yeah, a lot, uh, pretty much everything that's Xbox PS2 earlier and, um, tiger woods.
2650060	2651060	So,
2651060	2655380	you know, I'm surprised that, uh, I mean, there's some of the games on there like Simpsons.
2655380	2658580	I don't remember there being online for that.
2658580	2663300	Um, it was funny though, cause even like a Def Jam icon, that was one of those kids.
2663300	2664300	Oh yeah.
2664300	2666260	You can put your music in there and you know, play and stuff.
2666260	2667260	I'm like, Oh yeah.
2667260	2670780	If we put some weird like DDR music in there, that'd be really funny.
2670780	2672780	Cause it's meant for more like hip hop stuff.
2672780	2673780	Yeah.
2673780	2674780	Oh well.
2674780	2675780	No.
2675780	2678300	Well, you know, and it's not really surprising.
2678300	2684980	I mean, it costs money to run the servers and if they're not making any more money on
2684980	2689140	these games and you know, new stuff's going to be coming out, what's the point of keeping
2689140	2690140	it around?
2690140	2691140	Yeah.
2691140	2693180	Well, there's a lot of companies out there that don't really have these servers that
2693180	2694180	they shut down.
2694180	2697620	I mean, um, really EA is the main one we hear about every now and then.
2697620	2704540	Um, and then I think we had one from Sega when they shut down the server for Chrome
2704540	2710540	hounds, but I mean, those are the only ones I've heard of for like a while.
2710540	2711540	So I don't know.
2711540	2712540	That's kind of interesting.
2712540	2718820	Well, and you know, Xbox original getting shut down is, you know, somewhat notable,
2718820	2722640	you know, just, but that's just, that's just a matter of time.
2722640	2726780	But I don't understand like current generation stuff, the servers being shut down for them.
2726780	2729020	I mean, that's just kind of weird.
2729020	2733220	I can understand like, you know, okay, yeah, we're moving on to the PlayStation four, you
2733220	2736540	know, the PlayStation network for PlayStation three is going to have to go away and keep
2736540	2743140	in mind also looking again, economy wise, you know, a lot of companies are losing money
2743140	2744140	anyway.
2744140	2747620	If they're trying to mitigate, I fully believe that it's just, it's to mitigate cost.
2747620	2748620	I really do.
2748620	2749620	I think that's part of it too.
2749620	2755020	And Loki, as you said earlier, you play what grand theft auto and nobody's ever online.
2755020	2757380	I'm kind of surprised they're not threatening to pull the plug on that.
2757380	2760420	If people aren't using it, it's costing them to keep the they are just, they're not playing
2760420	2761420	what I'm playing.
2761420	2762420	I see.
2762420	2767380	I mean, specific settings, um, cause we play with auto aim off and some newbie players
2767380	2771860	out there like play with auto aim on and that would be me.
2771860	2777660	And uh, so because of that, anybody is searching for a game with auto aim on, they're only
2777660	2779220	going to find auto aim on games.
2779220	2780940	So you have to specify that.
2780940	2784080	But I mean, how many people are really playing like Godfather online anymore?
2784080	2785080	You know, it's probably really hard.
2785080	2789080	Probably not that many people like, I mean, put it this way, like for like validate Tony
2789080	2793020	right now, which is one of the expansions, but most people are playing the vanilla grand
2793020	2794020	theft auto stuff.
2794020	2798260	I mean, so I'm sure there's, you know, hundreds of thousands of people online for, um, the
2798260	2799260	battle of gay Tony.
2799260	2802940	There's at least 50,000 people on the ranked leaderboards, um, right now.
2802940	2806180	So um, there's a lot of people out there.
2806180	2811380	It's just, you know, whether they may be wanting to play just free mode or just, you know,
2811380	2818140	some other, you know, death match, non ranked, you know, team death match, who knows?
2818140	2819140	All right.
2819140	2820940	Uh, chat dot orange lounge, radio.com.
2820940	2824700	If you want to join us, uh, X-link reminds us they've also shut down the servers for
2824700	2827460	the PS two and PC versions of fantasy star universe.
2827460	2829380	That was another big recent one.
2829380	2833180	Fantasy star universe is starting to disappear, which is a pretty big deal, but yeah, I'm
2833180	2834180	not kind of not surprised.
2834180	2837280	A lot of the communities on X-Box three 60 cause wasn't that the only way you had the
2837280	2839900	voice enabled in it too, maybe.
2839900	2840900	Yeah.
2840900	2845260	So, well of course you could always use something like ventrilo or something on the PC, I suppose.
2845260	2846960	Well let's move on.
2846960	2851500	So one thing that would suck if the server shut down for it would be, um, Ubisoft's new
2851500	2853380	PC DRM servers.
2853380	2858020	Um, apparently of course they revealed the plan back in January that they're going to
2858020	2864000	streamline their DM DRM process across all PC titles by making players log into Ubisoft
2864000	2867040	servers to authenticate before playing.
2867040	2872980	Now that doesn't sound too bad right now, but there's a few things of course you have
2872980	2874400	to understand.
2874400	2880540	It's um, the system is kind of flawed and the reason being is for example, if your connection
2880540	2885660	experiences any sort of issue, uh, you know, whether it be like, you know, dropping bandwidth
2885660	2891220	or momentary pause, router reboot or whatever, the software will immediately boot you out
2891220	2897020	of your game back to the main menu and you'll lose all your progress until, you know, up
2897020	2899460	to the previous save.
2899460	2901940	And um, that's it.
2901940	2907980	So, um, if Ubisoft's master servers encounter any errors, then all the players with a working
2907980	2912080	connection logged into the servers will not be able to play their games until the servers
2912080	2913080	are back online.
2913080	2918260	Oh gee, Ubisoft's customer support isn't about to blow up or anything.
2918260	2923100	So you know, um, doesn't Ubisoft make the like imagine games?
2923100	2924100	Yes they do.
2924100	2925100	Okay.
2925100	2927580	So I imagine there's equivalents of that on the PC, right?
2927580	2931260	Well the main, the two titles that are going to be coming up, and this is according to
2931260	2937940	PC gaming, they tested the two upcoming titles, um, Assassin's Creed 2 and Settlers 7.
2937940	2942780	I don't think they have any imagine games for a PC, but they would have this DRM if
2942780	2943780	they did.
2943780	2944780	And that's where I'm going with this.
2944780	2949800	And you know, not everybody that would be buying a game like that is tech savvy enough
2949800	2952540	to understand what DRM even is.
2952540	2956580	You know, certainly not, the type of people that buy those imagine games are probably
2956580	2959460	not the same people that listen to this podcast unless of course they're buying it for their
2959460	2960460	kids.
2960460	2966980	You know, my point is, you're going to have these, uh, moms buying it for their daughters
2966980	2971860	and you know, people that don't really follow gaming or understand what DRM even is that
2971860	2973860	just know the game isn't going to fire up on the computer.
2973860	2975460	Who's going to get the phone call about that?
2975460	2979700	The phone calls are going to go to Ubisoft or they're going to go to targets and Walmarts
2979700	2981100	across the country.
2981100	2984820	And when that starts happening, they're going to stop carrying it.
2984820	2985820	Exactly.
2985820	2992220	Um, I have a feeling, um, that this will be cracked in probably a few days.
2992220	2996660	Well, usually those types of things are, and people are going to turn to that and sadly
2996660	2998020	it what's going to end up happening.
2998020	3004580	But unfortunately, soccer mom Jones who buys this for her daughter, you'll imagine, I don't
3004580	3006780	know, dress up shop or whatever they come out with.
3006780	3007980	How many of those imagine games are there?
3007980	3009380	We were a target last too many.
3009380	3012740	How many of those imagine games were there on the shelf, Alan, like, like 5,000, right?
3012740	3013740	At least a dozen.
3013740	3014740	Yeah.
3014740	3021420	I just caught your eye right next to cooking mama one, two, three, and gardening mama.
3021420	3028700	And you know, it's just everything crazy anyhow, uh, while we're talking about online authentication,
3028700	3030260	I think this is kind of interesting.
3030260	3033060	It's almost like a combination of the past couple of stories we've been hearing about,
3033060	3039280	you know, server costs to maintain as well as a little bit about the, uh, DRM, um, so
3039280	3041980	come fire team Bravo three.
3041980	3046500	If you are going to be playing this game on the PSP, you're going to get a code so that
3046500	3050620	you can go and redeem it on the PlayStation network and you'll be able to access the game
3050620	3051620	online.
3051620	3056340	But if you don't buy this game either directly through PSN because it will automatically
3056340	3062260	be enabled or you get the code new, you will have to shell out $20 to get the license to
3062260	3063820	let you play online.
3063820	3064940	Think about that for a minute.
3064940	3068780	What that basically means is they're kind of targeting people who are going after this
3068780	3072340	used or the people who buy this second hand, because think about it.
3072340	3074320	If you buy it new, you'll get a code.
3074320	3077280	If you buy it online, you don't need a code cause you bought it online.
3077280	3079900	But if you buy it used, no code for you.
3079900	3082380	Well, it's for piracy really.
3082380	3086260	You think that's part of it or you think it's, that's what they're targeting it for.
3086260	3087260	I see.
3087260	3088260	So $20 to be able to actually play.
3088260	3090500	You know what I hear the funniest part about though.
3090500	3094260	Wouldn't they be, what wouldn't a pirated game not be able to go online to get authenticated
3094260	3095260	though?
3095260	3096540	No, it can, it can go online.
3096540	3100700	Interesting because pirated games, basically they act like just installed games, but here's
3100700	3104260	the, here's the best part.
3104260	3108260	Sony actually has a workaround for it in their own system.
3108260	3113360	And the reason this is, can grant it, you can't play online games, but thanks to that
3113360	3116420	wonderful and I don't remember what the hell it's called now, but remember how you can
3116420	3120380	do ad hoc over the internet with Sony PlayStation three?
3120380	3124660	Well, guess I don't need to go online to play other people online.
3124660	3129180	I can just go ad hoc over the internet and it works just fine.
3129180	3130380	It's not lag city or anything.
3130380	3132020	No, it shouldn't be.
3132020	3133020	Interesting.
3133020	3137560	By the way, uh, John color from Sony actually, I was quoted to IGN saying it's quote a trial
3137560	3140900	run for a new initiative we are exploring for the platform.
3140900	3145620	So even if you're like, ah, fuck it, I don't play SOCOM, uh, this could still be in the
3145620	3147580	future impacting a game you play.
3147580	3153660	They're waiting to see how long it's cracked and it probably will get cracked somehow.
3153660	3156180	They don't think they use thing has anything to do with it.
3156180	3158180	Oh, I'm sure that it has a little bit to do with it.
3158180	3162740	That's why they also were testing out the market with, um, like member local, not local
3162740	3169940	record to, um, pot upon two, I think where they had the game in a retail box, but all
3169940	3172020	it was was a card with a scratch off.
3172020	3173020	Oh yeah.
3173020	3174020	And I saw that at fries.
3174020	3175020	Yeah.
3175020	3176020	You know, so that's another thing.
3176020	3177300	They were test marketing.
3177300	3182140	So I'm just thinking if I were to pick up this game used, I'd be kind of irritated that
3182140	3184220	I have to go online and pay another $20.
3184220	3187540	Like again, here we go with the angry phone calls from people who don't know better to
3187540	3189180	this time GameStop.
3189180	3193180	And if I were GameStop, you know, and you can use that term loosely to describe whatever
3193180	3196520	game store makes their bread and butter off of used games and happens to sell new games
3196520	3197520	as well.
3197520	3198520	I'd be kind of pissed.
3198520	3203580	And I would like, can you imagine, especially with such a powerhouse that GameStop is, and
3203580	3207380	we'll just throw in all the other, you know, like companies in there, okay.
3207380	3212060	Like the powerhouse that they are with something like this kind of going after their used market,
3212060	3215740	can you imagine if they were to say, and they have the power to do this, they run a magazine
3215740	3216980	for heaven's sake.
3216980	3219020	They could discourage people from buying the game.
3219020	3220020	Think about it.
3220020	3221020	What's to stop.
3221020	3225640	I mean, this, this might be a little conspiracy theory here, but what's to stop GameStop from
3225640	3230560	publishing a negative review in this game in Game Informer, which is the most popular
3230560	3234820	video game magazine out there that happens to be run by GameStop to discourage people
3234820	3237980	from buying this game for no other reason than it cuts into the used game market.
3237980	3241280	But yet they use this whole, they're going to get to with the $20 thing.
3241280	3242280	It's the reason.
3242280	3246240	But the real reason is the bottom line of the game stores because they need the advertising
3246240	3251020	dollars that are provided by Sony to be able to run their magazine.
3251020	3255740	But the same thing though, they could basically discourage people from, you know, buying the
3255740	3261820	game without writing a negative review and use the employees letting people know.
3261820	3267520	But I would think at the same time that this could be bad for Sony anyways, because when
3267520	3272160	a competing game comes out there, let's see, am I going to buy the game that won't let
3272160	3276760	me play online unless I pay $20 or the other game that's equally cool that I can play online
3276760	3277760	for free?
3277760	3278760	Hmm.
3278760	3279760	That's a tough one.
3279760	3283200	I will go with the free one.
3283200	3284200	Let's see.
3284200	3285200	Tiger Claw in our chat room.
3285200	3289160	chat.orangeslaungeradio.com says, I wonder what if Sony sells this game in twos?
3289160	3293120	For example, what if you want to only buy the multiplayer part, couldn't you just purchase
3293120	3297240	the multiplayer game itself and not the full single player?
3297240	3301000	And here's the problem too with the SOCOM 3.
3301000	3304300	It's not a discounted game.
3304300	3306680	It's a full price game.
3306680	3311560	So it's not like, hey, we're selling this for 20 bucks, but you know, if you want to
3311560	3317000	go online to pay the other 20 and then, you know, equal the cost of a full price game.
3317000	3319580	No, it's nothing like that where they're offering a discount.
3319580	3322920	It's a full price game and then you have to pay another $20 on top of it.
3322920	3325480	Well, you know what I say, if you don't like it, don't buy it.
3325480	3326480	End of story.
3326480	3328040	I mean, that's really what it is.
3328040	3329040	If you don't like it, don't buy it.
3329040	3332280	But I mean, a game like this SOCOM has its fan base.
3332280	3333280	This is good.
3333280	3335360	There's people that aren't even going to bat an eye at this because they already are going
3335360	3336960	to buy the game new.
3336960	3337960	They'll find a way.
3337960	3340520	No, we'll see what happens.
3340520	3341520	Let's move on with some more stories.
3341520	3344200	We've got release dates coming up as well as the classic game of the week and a little
3344200	3346080	bit here on Orange Lounge Radio.
3346080	3348720	Well, this is some good news.
3348720	3349720	How about something happy?
3349720	3350720	Yay.
3350720	3351720	Happy.
3351720	3352720	It looks happy for me because I'm playing it.
3352720	3353720	You're going to give me money?
3353720	3354720	Yay.
3354720	3355720	I'm not playing that game.
3355720	3356720	I'm not playing that game.
3356720	3357720	I'm not playing that game.
3357720	3358720	Star Trek.
3358720	3359720	Star Trek Online.
3359720	3365520	They are actually working on ways of opening up the ship so that you can explore more of
3365520	3366520	your own ship.
3366520	3370440	You know, so far, all you can do is go hang out on the bridge and that's kind of boring.
3370440	3376880	You know, I look at my Andorian dude just, you know, piloting, I'm like, okay, he's piloting.
3376880	3382160	And I can sit in my captain's chair, ooh, but you can't really do much.
3382160	3386720	I mean, you can invite people there, but I would really like to, I even think it would
3386720	3390960	be cool to have like, you know, in ship missions, you know, that would be cool.
3390960	3394040	You know, you have to fight the Borg in the middle of your ship or something.
3394040	3395040	Oh, like first contact.
3395040	3396040	Yeah.
3396040	3398160	By the way, I thought you said happy news, not nerdy news.
3398160	3399160	It is happy news.
3399160	3400160	I'm just kidding.
3400160	3406040	I said it was happy for me, but, um, they basically want to make it more, you know,
3406040	3410560	do what they can to make it more like actual Star Trek.
3410560	3413880	And this is something that they've quoted as saying that it's something that they want
3413880	3418120	to do, but they're not going to implement it until they have it working flawlessly.
3418120	3421200	Well of course, you don't want, especially with an MMO, you'll piss off your user base
3421200	3423000	if you roll out something that's all flawed.
3423000	3424040	I want a holodeck.
3424040	3425680	Would I be able to, a holodeck would be cool.
3425680	3428880	Would I also be able to walk around the ship and demand that people bow down before me
3428880	3431760	or I'll shoot to kill?
3431760	3432760	No.
3432760	3437720	However, um, I get, I bet if you're, you know, I see, I think it would be cool if you could
3437720	3440560	actually, you know, do like rank things going up through your ship too.
3440560	3444600	But then that means you're, if you're on the Klingon ship and you do something your subordinates
3444600	3448920	think is cowardly, they can challenge you to a doodle of death.
3448920	3449920	Interesting.
3449920	3453000	Well, at least that's how it works on a Klingon ship.
3453000	3456000	I want to change my music and have Klingon opera playing in the background on my Klingon
3456000	3457000	ship.
3457000	3460200	I think you should have a, there's Klingons on the starboard bow, starboard bow, starboard
3460200	3463460	bow.
3463460	3465320	That was nerdier than what I said.
3465320	3466320	Okay.
3466320	3467320	Touche.
3467320	3468320	All right.
3468320	3471240	We're going to travel around the world now and check out some release dates and some
3471240	3473560	things coming to a store near you.
3473560	3474560	Yes.
3474560	3477080	This week I actually got some pretty cool stuff coming out.
3477080	3482200	I'm starting off with Endless Ocean Blue World coming out on the Nintendo Wii.
3482200	3486140	You can also find that with a bundle with Wii Speak because yes, you can play this game
3486140	3490160	online and talk to each other while you're under the sea.
3490160	3496880	On Xbox 360 Risen, the ever delayed game now coming out on Xbox 360 and I believe the PC
3496880	3500000	version came out last October.
3500000	3505000	Lovely Lisa and Friends on the DS apparently from the Tommy Corporation.
3505000	3507080	I believe it's a doll that's actually in Japan.
3507080	3509480	Why this is being brought out over here is beyond me.
3509480	3510520	Because she's lovely.
3510520	3512520	I guess.
3512520	3522360	Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii DS and PSP.
3522360	3526920	And of course that's going to feature all your favorite Sonic characters or Sega characters
3526920	3533600	and Banjo-Kazooie of course in the Xbox 360 version.
3533600	3537320	See here.
3537320	3539600	Hello Kitty Birthday Adventures on DS.
3539600	3540600	Yippee.
3540600	3541600	Yeah.
3541600	3542640	I know.
3542640	3546760	Napoleon Total War coming out on PC.
3546760	3550320	Pony Friends 2 coming out on DS.
3550320	3553200	Anything our listeners might actually want to buy?
3553200	3554200	What are you saying?
3554200	3555680	Pony Friends 2 is not on the top of their list?
3555680	3557560	You know, I'm thinking no.
3557560	3560000	Well that's too bad.
3560000	3563960	Heavy Rain coming out on PlayStation 3 this week as well.
3563960	3569880	And then, let's see, wrapping it up, Deck of Sports on DS.
3569880	3574240	Oh, Deck of Sports was the one that had curling in it, right?
3574240	3577880	Yes, I'm not sure if the DS version has curling in it.
3577880	3580640	I love Winter Olympics time of year.
3580640	3583400	But I know they have a bunch of other stuff in there.
3583400	3586720	I think it's maybe new sports in the DS version.
3586720	3590560	Of course, it's not going to let me see it, so.
3590560	3591560	Oh well.
3591560	3595200	Alright, well should I travel over to Japan and take a look at the releases over there?
3595200	3596200	Sure.
3596200	3597200	Alright.
3597200	3598200	Hi.
3598200	3602200	Coming out on February 25th on the Xbox 360, a localized version of Borderlands comes out
3602200	3603640	from 2K Games.
3603640	3610000	Also a game called Espgaluda 2, a black label comes out in the limited edition and regular
3610000	3611000	formats.
3611000	3612000	Of course, there's a 2 there.
3612000	3613000	It is the sequel to Espgaluda.
3613000	3617160	And if you've never heard of it, that's because it's a shmup, it's a shoot-em-up.
3617160	3621280	Very colorful, seizure-inducing graphics where most of your screen is taken up with an overlay
3621280	3622800	because it's a vertical shooter.
3622800	3628800	But you know there are some hardcore shmup fans out there, so I'm sure they'll be picking
3628800	3631340	this up without delay.
3631340	3636320	Also no fate, only the power of will comes out from Alchemist on February 25th on the
3636320	3637320	Xbox 360.
3637320	3638480	Not sure what this game's all about.
3638480	3643060	Of course, it's got anime girls all over it, but this chick who's getting out of the pool
3643060	3644060	is kind of angry.
3644060	3645480	I don't know why she's so angry.
3645480	3646480	She's getting out of the pool there.
3646480	3647480	She looks like Utena.
3647480	3648480	It's an adventure game.
3648480	3649960	And then this other chick's just dreaming.
3649960	3653040	But I like to think that maybe she is looking at the chick getting out of the pool and that's
3653040	3654040	just making her angry.
3654040	3655040	I don't know.
3655040	3660760	Anyhow, that made for a much funnier in-studio than it did radio, I apologize for that.
3660760	3661760	Moving on.
3661760	3662760	I snorted my root beer if that makes you feel better.
3662760	3663760	It does, a little bit.
3663760	3666440	And there is no curling in Deck of Sports DS.
3666440	3667560	Fail.
3667560	3669360	A million times fail.
3669360	3671960	PlayStation 3, a price reduction on Demon's Souls.
3671960	3674160	If you haven't picked that up yet, you really should.
3674160	3675160	It's awesome.
3675160	3677280	That's pretty much the only thing to look forward to on PlayStation 3 unless you need
3677280	3681600	like some new HDMI cables because some third parties are putting some more of those out.
3681600	3684440	But the Nintendo Wii has a lot this week, which is good because they've had some quiet
3684440	3688480	weeks lately, including Arc Rise Fantasia is coming out.
3688480	3692440	Ina no Susume selection, I think that might be just a price reduction then.
3692440	3695040	I think, yeah, Arc Rise Fantasia I think has already been out.
3695040	3696140	Just a price reduction there.
3696140	3698040	It's kind of like a best hits over there.
3698040	3702200	As far as new games go, Raji Ronnojia Wii.
3702200	3705080	That's the sequel to Radarji.
3705080	3707160	I don't know if I'm even saying that right.
3707160	3708160	Radarji.
3708160	3709160	Radarji.
3709160	3711220	There's like an extra R in here.
3711220	3713800	Another shmup basically, but this time on the Wii.
3713800	3715760	Radio Allergy as it's called over here.
3715760	3719320	Well the big thing about this one is that the final boss from the last game will now
3719320	3721440	be a PC in this game.
3721440	3723960	So you have shields and all that stuff.
3723960	3727080	Co-op mode and lots of fun things for a shmup game.
3727080	3730280	That again is on the Nintendo Wii.
3730280	3732440	Checking out some other systems on the DS.
3732440	3738280	Estpolis, The Lands Cursed by the Gods is coming out as well as Fushigi no Dungeon,
3738280	3742320	Furai no Shirin 4, Kami no Hitomi no Akuma no Heiso.
3742320	3743880	Yes, that is the entire name of the game.
3743880	3745120	Mystery Dungeon.
3745120	3746640	That is exactly I think what it is.
3746640	3748080	No, it's a learning language.
3748080	3750360	But Fushigi no Dungeon means Mystery Dungeon.
3750360	3754840	So it's not Chocobo's Mystery Dungeon, it's just the mystery is this new language you're
3754840	3755840	trying to learn.
3755840	3756840	Let me see.
3756840	3764560	I don't know if it's a, I don't know what language, but the guy's wearing a kind of
3764560	3765560	a funny hat.
3765560	3766560	He's got a monkey.
3766560	3770720	It's the funny hat game featuring monkey.
3770720	3772640	Also Super Robot Taisen OG Saga.
3772640	3775200	There's a series we can't get rid of.
3775200	3776200	That's right.
3776200	3777200	It's never going away.
3777200	3783800	And on the PSP, BlazBlue Portable comes out this week as well as Katekyo Hitman Reborn,
3783800	3787200	Kizuna no Tag Battle, which is of course a fighting game.
3787200	3789040	You can tell they're on the PSP.
3789040	3792440	I'm not sure if this is based off an anime, but this is like, it looks like that one where
3792440	3796400	you can do like four people at a time all playing at once.
3796400	3797400	Looks like fun.
3797400	3800800	That's going to do it for your Japanese release dates.
3800800	3808120	For the UK, we have on the 23rd Metal Slug XX and then on the 25th Blue Toad Murder Files
3808120	3809120	Episode 3.
3809120	3815440	And then the 26th, we've got Heavy Rain, Lips Party Classics, Napoleon, Total War, Sonic
3815440	3819080	and Sega All-Stars Racing and Undead Knights.
3819080	3824080	I believe Metal Slug XX is coming out over here in the US as well.
3824080	3825080	I love Metal Slug.
3825080	3827000	I must have missed that.
3827000	3830640	All right, let's do just a couple more stories and then we're going to get to the classic
3830640	3836440	game of the week and I believe Dark Soccer has picked a true classic for you guys tonight.
3836440	3837760	Better like it.
3837760	3841920	You know, I picked the most piss your pants title I could think of.
3841920	3846880	And it ties in with a game that we had coming out this week as well.
3846880	3849760	We'll get there in a minute.
3849760	3855880	So there's some new stuff coming out, not completely unexpected from THQ that they made
3855880	3856880	announcements for.
3856880	3860920	There's going to be a sequel to The Blob, which was actually a pretty cool game that
3860920	3863360	came out before on the Wii.
3863360	3869080	And this time, though, it's going to be branded under a new sci-fi channel brand, I guess,
3869080	3870760	called Sci-Fi Kids.
3870760	3871920	I don't know why they're...
3871920	3873600	I didn't even know there were sci-fi kids.
3873600	3875840	Do they make crappy children's shows, too?
3875840	3876840	I didn't know.
3876840	3879960	Well, they did like a Wizard of Oz and an Alice in Wonderland.
3879960	3882040	Yeah, where two are all really like...
3882040	3883680	They were like dark, weren't they?
3883680	3884680	They were weird.
3884680	3885680	Yeah.
3885680	3887800	I don't know.
3887800	3894440	So apparently, though, they're going to be working with the DiBlob character.
3894440	3897280	Maybe there'll be a cartoon show, who knows?
3897280	3898400	Will a Cylon show up?
3898400	3901160	I mean, maybe there's Battlestar Galactica, Caprica.
3901160	3902440	I don't think there's anything there.
3902440	3905560	When I think of Sci-Fi Network, I think of BSG.
3905560	3906560	I can't help it.
3906560	3909080	I think of crappy sci-fi movies that are normally on there.
3909080	3910080	That's true.
3910080	3911080	What is that?
3911080	3912080	Is that from Sci-Fi Network?
3912080	3913080	The Shark Meat Octopus?
3913080	3914080	Or what is it?
3914080	3915080	The Flying Shark?
3915080	3917080	The Flying Shark eats a plane out of the sky.
3917080	3918080	Yes.
3918080	3919080	Yeah.
3919080	3920080	That's all those lovely sci-fi movies.
3920080	3921480	Yeah, they show them on the soup all the time, right?
3921480	3922480	Yeah.
3922480	3923480	Oh, good times.
3923480	3924480	With Deborah Gibson.
3924480	3925480	Yes.
3925480	3926880	Because, you know, she's a woman now, so no longer Debbie.
3926880	3927880	That's right.
3927880	3933160	And then the other thing, of course, DiBlob is also going to be not just on the Wii this
3933160	3934160	time.
3934160	3938600	It's also supposed to be coming to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3938600	3943320	Also going to be some new Saints Rowan Red Faction at E3 this year.
3943320	3948840	Of course, Saints Row 3 is not supposed to be coming out until 2011, which makes me very
3948840	3949840	sad.
3949840	3954280	But the new Red Faction game is supposed to be slated for later this year, so that might
3954280	3955280	be cool.
3955280	3961240	And then, yeah, so I guess we'll have to wait until E3 to check those out.
3961240	3966200	Okay, I have to go back to the sci-fi thing for a minute, because the Blob game, yeah,
3966200	3967200	that's cool.
3967200	3970240	I remember playing DiBlob at PAX a couple years ago, of all places.
3970240	3972560	So, you know, and I remember Loki really enjoyed it too.
3972560	3976080	So don't get me wrong, I'm glad that game is getting a sequel, if sci-fi is putting
3976080	3977560	it out or however it's coming out.
3977560	3978560	But seriously?
3978560	3979560	It's still THQ, yeah.
3979560	3983840	Why aren't they making, like, the shark and octopus video game?
3983840	3988880	Like, when Alan was saying that sharks eat planes out of the sky, like, that sounds awesome.
3988880	3991040	Because the movie was awful.
3991040	3996520	But video games have plots that are about as good as a sci-fi movie, let's face it.
3996520	4000120	I mean, if you could, like, buy a Wii game.
4000120	4003880	Dark Sakura, wouldn't you want to play a video game on the Nintendo Wii?
4003880	4009720	Just imagine a game where it's a shark, or no, an octopus that has eight tentacles, and
4009720	4012040	all the tentacles are sharks.
4012040	4014840	And you destroy things, and Debra Gibson does a voice.
4014840	4016320	Wouldn't you want to buy that game?
4016320	4017320	Fuck yes!
4017320	4018320	See?
4018320	4022240	Well, okay, they put out the Jaws game, which, granted, was awesome, because you could maybe-
4022240	4023240	Fuck Jaws!
4023240	4024240	I'm talking-
4024240	4025960	Did Jaws eat a plane out of the sky?
4025960	4026960	It could have.
4026960	4028520	No, he chased around Richard Dreyfuss.
4028520	4029520	Boo hoo.
4029520	4030520	Yeah, shark.
4030520	4035520	The guy's got one foot in the grave, come on.
4035520	4036640	Did it have Debra Gibson?
4036640	4039960	I don't think so.
4039960	4041520	Chat room, am I crazy?
4041520	4043160	Well, we knew that.
4043160	4047040	No, I mean, for real about this, wouldn't you- Chat, would you or would you not want
4047040	4048040	to play that game?
4048040	4052960	ActDeft in chat says, President Cat versus Flying Shark Octopus.
4052960	4053960	There you go.
4053960	4056840	Dark Tetsuya says, screw President Cat, I want that game.
4056840	4060640	Look, I am all about these low, what the fuck, random games.
4060640	4064440	You ought to know that by now, listening to this show, unless it's your first time listening,
4064440	4067120	which again, I apologize.
4067120	4068120	What is that?
4068120	4069120	Is that something someone linked to?
4069120	4072200	Uncovering the secrets of Mega Shark, death in the skies.
4072200	4077880	Hold on, SSJ, I hate to do this in the middle of the show, but SSJ100Matt is linking us
4077880	4081800	to this YouTube, and just knowing SSJ100Matt, I think this is important.
4081800	4082800	Yes.
4082800	4084800	Holy shit.
4084800	4101040	The shark is eating the plane.
4101040	4103200	That needs to be on the end, and the birds fly away.
4103200	4105160	Why is that not on the Wii?
4105160	4108520	Why is that not being optioned for a video game?
4108520	4109520	That's awesome.
4109520	4112960	That was 50 kinds of awesome.
4112960	4114240	It's so awful.
4114240	4118160	You're only encouraging these people.
4118160	4123760	Video games are kind of stupid, Loki, welcome, I mean, I realize there are some video games
4123760	4127560	out there with deep plots and all this stuff, but come on.
4127560	4133760	That just screams America, fuck yeah, shark's eating planes.
4133760	4137000	I just like the scene dude looks out the window, shark!
4137000	4142840	I assure you that watching the two seconds of that, you know, aren't necessarily as good
4142840	4146760	as watching the full 90 minute movie.
4146760	4156960	Imagine you're sitting down with a Nintendo Wii and then all of a sudden, holy shit!
4156960	4159240	Why would a shark attack a plane?
4159240	4161200	It makes no sense.
4161200	4165960	Why do fighting characters decide to fight to the death and throw fireballs at each other
4165960	4168960	and do spinning bird kicks and all the other bullshit?
4168960	4169960	Come on!
4169960	4171480	It's a video game.
4171480	4172960	Sharks can eat planes.
4172960	4177000	In fact, that should be in Street Fighter V.
4177000	4180640	Maybe it could be in Civilization V, that's right, there is a Civilization V, how'd you
4180640	4181640	like that transition?
4181640	4185360	There is a Civilization V announced, it is coming fall of 2010.
4185360	4189200	Of course, this made me squeak, you know I love my Civilization, I think Civilization
4189200	4193760	I is like my favorite PC game they've ever made, but good old Sid Meier and Civilization
4193760	4199440	series, a fifth installment coming out from 2K Games this fall, 2010.
4199440	4203120	And I shouldn't be surprised at this news, although I have to admit this was news I kind
4203120	4207640	of wasn't expecting, but then the news came out this week and I was like, fuck yeah, another
4207640	4208640	Civilization!
4208640	4209640	Cool!
4209640	4213160	Like, I wasn't expecting it, but cool, because the fourth one was actually really good, it
4213160	4214840	was probably my favorite next to the first one.
4214840	4217720	But they are talking about it's going to be an all new engine, the biggest change, the
4217720	4222100	most shocking change if you will, they have switched to hexagon tiles instead of square
4222100	4227320	based tiles, it's now going to be hexagon, so think Catan meets Civilization, or Catanalization
4227320	4229320	if you will, is what I'm calling this game.
4229320	4231640	So there it is.
4231640	4235900	It's going to have of course, the leaders will be all animated, and the landscapes will
4235900	4240960	be all nice, and new combats, new diplomacy, and mods, mods, mods, because they are embracing
4240960	4243000	of the mods community, which is very cool.
4243000	4247240	Don't expect this to come out on consoles though, it's just, it's too much micromanaging
4247240	4250040	in Civilization game, it really can't be done on a console.
4250040	4255140	But of course there is Civ Revolution, which took some flack from Civ fans because it kind
4255140	4259200	of dumbed down the series if you will, but I'll tell you what, I think Civ Revolution
4259200	4260840	is a great introduction to the series.
4260840	4264120	It's kind of like, I think it was an overlooked game on consoles, I think it's a lot of fun.
4264120	4267760	I don't think it compares to the PC versions, but I think if you're just not much of a PC
4267760	4274200	gamer, or a game that is low key on your console, go for it, Civ Network is pretty cool.
4274200	4278680	So yeah, I'm looking forward to Civilization V.
4278680	4279920	Gonna get your Civ on?
4279920	4284320	Oh yeah, I might have to actually put down WoW to try this out for a little while.
4284320	4289160	Alan, I know you play some PC games, you play like a pretty big mix of PC and console games,
4289160	4290160	right?
4290160	4291160	Yep.
4291160	4292480	Do you play Civilization at all?
4292480	4293480	Not really.
4293480	4294480	I don't know if this is gonna work.
4294480	4299840	No, but seriously though, you play a lot of shooter type games, right?
4299840	4300840	Yeah.
4300840	4302440	What kind of PC games are you into?
4302440	4305400	Lots of first person shooters, like Bioshock and Half Life.
4305400	4311760	As far as a game like Civ, I was really into Rise of Nations, which was sort of a Civ clone
4311760	4316360	that came out by Big Huge Games under Microsoft's Game Studios label.
4316360	4319040	So yeah, I played that.
4319040	4320040	Very cool.
4320040	4328280	All right, um, before we get to the classic game of the week, I was sent another YouTube
4328280	4330480	from SSJ100Matt in private.
4330480	4332680	I have to watch this.
4332680	4344760	This is, um, the shark goes and eats the golden gate bridge just like that.
4344760	4346280	During midday commute too.
4346280	4347760	How rude of that shark.
4347760	4349240	Pericacra.
4349240	4352840	If that was in a video game.
4352840	4355360	I won't play as the fucking shark.
4355360	4356960	Exactly.
4356960	4358920	That's why Jaws didn't sell Loki.
4358920	4361320	Can Jaws eat the golden gate bridge?
4361320	4363320	No.
4363320	4366320	I think that he's tuned you out, Rob.
4366320	4369480	When Loki is playing some game over there, it looks like it's like on the Atari 2600.
4369480	4371000	It's gotta be homebrew of some sort.
4371000	4372000	Loki, what is it?
4372000	4373000	Speak up.
4373000	4374480	What are you playing over there?
4374480	4375480	It's Cream Wolf.
4375480	4376480	What?
4376480	4377480	Gross.
4377480	4381120	What is it?
4381120	4382120	What is?
4382120	4388040	You're a werewolf ice cream guy and you have to make people fat so you can eat them.
4388040	4389040	Okay.
4389040	4394600	I'm thinking of a parody of a Shakira song already.
4394600	4396160	Now I'm- Can I do my bit, Rob?
4396160	4398280	I guess you can do your bit.
4398280	4402160	You've been very patient and suffering through an hour and a half of OLR tonight.
4402160	4405200	Actually, it's only an hour and 15 minutes, but we were here in the studio for quite a
4405200	4406200	bit beforehand.
4406200	4408400	Classic game of the week, et cetera, et cetera.
4408400	4412400	Goes into the vault, finds a game, blah, blah, blah, picks one for you and it's great.
4412400	4413400	Yeah?
4413400	4414400	Yes.
4414400	4417560	Our game of the week is Shenmue.
4417560	4418560	Yay.
4418560	4419560	Why?
4419560	4420560	Yes.
4420560	4422680	I would like to try a game of Lucky Hit.
4422680	4430080	All I found was just the soundtrack stuff because really I was getting tired of listening
4430080	4432520	to Rio talk.
4432520	4433880	Asking about sailors.
4433880	4434880	I know.
4434880	4435880	The sailors one.
4435880	4438200	I had to go back and watch that.
4438200	4440200	Do you have sailors that come in here?
4440200	4446600	Well, sometimes they come in at night, but they leave before it gets too late.
4446600	4448240	The lady of months.
4448240	4449240	Yeah.
4449240	4450240	Anyway.
4450240	4457000	Shenmue is one of the masterpieces of Yu Suzuki.
4457000	4467480	It's really meant for interactive and to be a freeform environment and you have real life
4467480	4472040	aspects like you go to bed, you get up in the morning, you pee, well, I don't know,
4472040	4476720	they clearly don't show him peeing, but you can also go to vending machines and arcades
4476720	4485280	and you can play classic games in the arcades, which is awesome, and he has a video game
4485280	4494000	system in his house, he has convenience stores, so it's really open as for what you can do.
4494000	4500360	With the characters in there, basically the overall story is that Rio comes home and finds
4500360	4504720	him beating up his dad and then he gets smacked around and then his dad tells him where to
4504720	4511360	find something that he's looking for and the game goes from there.
4511360	4515160	You go around and you're actually trying to track down this guy and trying to figure out
4515160	4520760	what's going on and you have to talk to all the people and you have to do rescues and
4520760	4526760	you have to go against these other guys, it's a big investigation, you know, and you just
4526760	4529120	play as this guy.
4529120	4532200	And you can also raise kittens.
4532200	4533200	You can feed kittens.
4533200	4534200	Oh well, I'm sold.
4534200	4538200	They're cute little kittens.
4538200	4548760	But the game was, there were little quick-time events that were in the game too, where you
4548760	4552960	would witness something and you would have to hit the right button at the right time
4552960	4556440	and that's how a lot of the fighting went too and then it would go along with the cut
4556440	4561760	scene and you had your little questing areas and you had your different battles and Rio
4561760	4568360	could fight because his dad ran a dojo and of course he was going to teach his kid.
4568360	4574240	The cool thing about this though is that it was supposed to be a killer app for the Saturn.
4574240	4576400	That was the big thing about it.
4576400	4588840	In fact, you can actually find online a video of the Saturn version, it was pretty sweet
4588840	4595720	for Saturn at the time, but it was going to try to revive the Saturn, you know, but since
4595720	4600840	the Dreamcast was coming out, they actually started working on Shenmue for, at the time
4600840	4603320	it was Katana, remember?
4603320	4604320	The working name?
4604320	4606720	That's right, I remember that, yeah.
4606720	4610840	And then, while it was being worked on, it was called Project Berkeley, so there were
4610840	4617440	tech demos out under that name and then it went into actual production for Dreamcast
4617440	4626320	and every character that you run into in the game has, they had voice actors for, in Japanese
4626320	4631880	and English, a full orchestrated soundtrack.
4631880	4636600	At that time, that level of voice acting was kind of unheard of too, that was pretty awesome
4636600	4637600	I gotta say.
4637600	4644680	And then it had a weather system in the game called the Magic Weather System, so when you
4644680	4651520	go through the game you have different, you know, things that are happening but they actually
4651520	4658440	were meant to reflect the actual weather conditions of Yokosuka at the time, which is where he
4658440	4665800	lived in Japan, and it was set in the 1986, 1987, so you could actually go and explore
4665800	4668800	different parts of town too.
4668800	4671840	So this could have been happening concurrently with Karate Kid 2?
4671840	4672840	Yes.
4672840	4673840	Okay.
4673840	4679760	I mean, you know, it's meant to be, you know, what Japan was like in the 80s in a little
4679760	4685600	small town, you know, in the Japanese version you had Coca Cola stuff everywhere, which
4685600	4692520	is funny, since Pepsi Japan, their big thing was with, Sega's big thing was with Pepsi.
4692520	4695160	Do you remember they had Pepsi Man?
4695160	4701680	I remember in the Crazy Taxi games you were going to all the Pepsi brand restaurants.
4701680	4706880	But they actually put out a couple of games in Japan that were Pepsi Man.
4706880	4711560	You could actually go on YouTube and look at the little commercials of Pepsi Man.
4711560	4715760	So anyway, so I thought it was funny that, you know, they had Coca Cola for that one
4715760	4722880	everywhere and, you know, and it was, you know, also with, they were trying to show
4722880	4727200	exactly what, you know, people were like in that days, like the younger generation was
4727200	4729720	going more towards a western look for things.
4729720	4733880	So you had your older generation in one style and your younger generation in a different
4733880	4735520	style.
4735520	4743800	And you also had a passport desk that you could go in and view the cut scenes for the
4743800	4748040	movies, you could listen to the music, you had information so you could learn about other
4748040	4753360	things going on in the game and the characters, you had the mini games you could replay, you
4753360	4757920	had a free battle, just all kinds of interactive stuff.
4757920	4765080	And then you could use the passport to get to Shenmue World through the Dreamcast internet.
4765080	4770360	So it was, you know, just all kinds of, it had an online manual, network ranking for
4770360	4771680	all your things.
4771680	4777960	You could play with, you had VMU icons, you know, for your cute little VMU, collectible
4777960	4781520	items like the toy capsules, you know, which would be like, you know, ships from other
4781520	4786640	games that, I had an Oppa Oppa, you know, your data review.
4786640	4788240	It was all kinds of stuff.
4788240	4793480	And you can also track everything that you've done in the game from how long you've played
4793480	4799280	to how long you've done the mini games to how many soft drinks you've bought.
4799280	4805240	And it, of course, discontinued when they canceled Dreamcast production.
4805240	4814600	And there was a sequel, of course, which was Shenmue 2, but because it didn't sell very
4814600	4819200	well, you know, Shenmue or Shenmue 2, we didn't get any more story.
4819200	4820200	That was it.
4820200	4823960	And there's people still holding their breath for Shenmue 3.
4823960	4828320	And I have a feeling that we might see it one day, but I like breathing.
4828320	4838120	But, you know, they also did a figure that Dan showed me of Ryo driving a forklift.
4838120	4840960	And there's also, he's in the Sega Racers game.
4840960	4841960	Yes, he is.
4841960	4845240	He's riding the motorbike and he also rides the forklift.
4845240	4852800	But you can actually buy a figure, a recent figure that came out of Ryo riding a forklift.
4852800	4853800	Can I admit something?
4853800	4854800	Go for it.
4854800	4855800	Never played this game.
4855800	4857000	Well, I'd fix that.
4857000	4860280	I've heard about how fascinating it is, but I just, you know, I even had a Dreamcast,
4860280	4862320	but I just never really got around to playing this game.
4862320	4863760	Would you like to borrow my copy?
4863760	4866280	Would you like to play a game of Lucky Hit?
4866280	4868800	That's all I know from the game.
4868800	4872000	There's some video where the dude just goes around asking everybody that.
4872000	4874880	And I kind of found it funny, so.
4874880	4876760	But I've always heard about its epic epicness.
4876760	4878560	You can play my copy if you want.
4878560	4880680	I don't even know if my Dreamcast is hooked up.
4880680	4882760	It's full of epic epicness, like you just said.
4882760	4883760	All right.
4883760	4885720	Shenmue, your classic game of the week.
4885720	4886720	So there it is.
4886720	4887720	All right.
4887720	4890360	We're going to take a break here at Orange Lounge Radio, but we got plenty more to come
4890360	4893560	tonight in part B. We got, of course, your phone calls and your Twitter topics.
4893560	4896680	If you haven't sent in any Twitter topics, go ahead and get those in right now to at
4896680	4898880	o-l-r on Twitter.
4898880	4902080	We're going to get to the rapid fire news as well and then get to some other stories
4902080	4907740	including the kind of a surprising new iPhone game as well as some of the dates and things
4907740	4912280	for the upcoming Xbox Live Block Party and some news on Fable 3.
4912280	4922640	We got all that coming up right after a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4922640	4926600	And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday night, February
4926600	4928440	the 21st of 2010.
4928440	4932080	You are listening to that podcast where every gamer has a voice.
4932080	4936920	And you might not know this, but we have an Olympic gold medal for being awesome.
4936920	4939980	So we're going to talk about some more gaming news, of course, tonight.
4939980	4942320	Join us if you're listening live at All Games Radio.
4942320	4946760	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to be as you are listening live on this Sunday.
4946760	4949520	If you've never listened live before, you really should join us sometime.
4949520	4952160	It's kind of a different show when you're listening live.
4952160	4954700	And as Alan is finding out tonight, it's a really different show when you're sitting
4954700	4955700	here in studio.
4955700	4956700	Correct?
4956700	4957700	Yes.
4957700	4958700	Yes.
4958700	4959700	What was the comparison you were making earlier during the break?
4959700	4960700	I don't even know if you want to share it.
4960700	4961700	But it was funny.
4961700	4962700	I laughed.
4962700	4963700	No, that's all right.
4963700	4964700	Are you sure?
4964700	4965700	Yeah.
4965700	4966700	I'm good.
4966700	4967700	Because I'll try to tell it.
4967700	4968700	It won't be as funny.
4968700	4969700	Cheers.
4969700	4970700	Thanks a lot.
4970700	4971700	Nice.
4971700	4972700	All right.
4972700	4973700	Let's go ahead and get back into some gaming news and, of course, Twitter topics coming
4973700	4974700	up.
4974700	4975700	So be sure to get those in.
4975700	4977600	So quick stories real quick, Logie.
4977600	4978600	Yes.
4978600	4985400	There's a cool fan made 8-bit-esque Mega Man first person shooter game that someone's made
4985400	4987860	called Mega Man 8-bit Deathmatch.
4987860	4992700	And it features some of the original Mega Man characters and their kind of 8-bit glory.
4992700	4996500	It's kind of almost like a Doom mod, but I don't think it is.
4996500	4998360	And yeah, it's really sweet.
4998360	5005500	You can actually check it out on, I believe it's cutstuff.net is where you can find that
5005500	5007000	to download.
5007000	5008220	And apparently it's free.
5008220	5010380	At least they have a trailer of it and stuff.
5010380	5015860	I'm not sure when it's actually being released, but it's pretty cool.
5015860	5017060	Yeah.
5017060	5018860	Anyways.
5018860	5021740	So other things that are pretty cool.
5021740	5026500	There's a lot of stuff out there that are allowing you to buy a game and get something
5026500	5027500	else for free.
5027500	5030540	For example, last week we talked about how if you were one of the people that bought
5030540	5034860	Darksiders, you would get a code for a free Red Faction game.
5034860	5040980	Well, if you didn't happen to keep your mystery code with your copy of Darksiders, fear not.
5040980	5047020	You can still redeem a free copy of Red Faction Guerrilla, assuming that you have a copy of
5047020	5052300	your receipt and some other stuff that they want you to send them copies of.
5052300	5057660	And with that you will get a free copy of Red Faction Guerrilla and a digital art book.
5057660	5064940	Also another kind of bonus THQ is handing out, with people that pre-ordered Dawn of
5064940	5070620	War 2, the expansion to the Warhammer franchise, you will be able to get Saints Row 2 on PC
5070620	5074100	for free, which is pretty cool.
5074100	5077500	And then of course THQ isn't the only ones doing that.
5077500	5081620	For Battlefield Bad Company 2 on PC, if you happen to pre-order your copy through the
5081620	5089460	EA store, you will net yourself a free copy of Battlefield 2142 as well.
5089460	5098420	And then finally, if you happen not to play PC games and maybe bought a PSP Go, during
5098420	5105380	the last few weeks here, you'll be able to redeem, I guess, a free copy of Assassin's
5105380	5109540	Creed Bloodlines or Little Big Planet for PSP.
5109540	5116260	And to do this, you have to redeem it between February 18th and March 21st.
5116260	5120020	Wait, so that's like if you just buy a new PSP Go, you can get one of those games for
5120020	5121020	free?
5121020	5122020	Yeah, during this time.
5122020	5123020	Hmm.
5123020	5125140	I guess they're trying to finally make it worth some of the money they're asking for
5125140	5126140	it.
5126140	5127140	Yeah, so that's kinda cool.
5127140	5128140	Alrighty.
5128140	5134860	And then finally, there was a contest that was being held for modders for Unreal Tournament
5134860	5141620	3, and Epic has released the winners of the Make Something Unreal Contest, and several
5141620	5145100	mod teams created a bunch of different mods for it.
5145100	5147780	The winning mod was a game called The Hunted.
5147780	5152220	It was a third-person survivor horror action game that kinda looked like a Wild West version
5152220	5153900	of Left 4 Dead.
5153900	5158900	As the winner of the contest, the team will receive $50,000 and a commercial license for
5158900	5163580	the Unreal Engine, meaning the team can actually make an Unreal Engine title as a commercial
5163580	5165460	product.
5165460	5169380	And that'd be pretty awesome looking.
5169380	5171860	So I'd watch a trailer for this and it's sweet.
5171860	5178240	Some of the other winners, second place was The Ball from Toltec Studios.
5178240	5185420	Third place, Angels Fall First by Plantstorm, and it's the Plantstorm team, they won $30,000.
5185420	5192480	Fourth place, Prometheus, and also the Prometheus team, they won $20,000.
5192480	5196260	And it looks like fifth place won $10,000, with Hazard, A Journey of Life.
5196260	5198900	And they had some other categories as well.
5198900	5201020	Lots of money being given away though.
5201020	5203740	That's pretty cool.
5203740	5207340	So yeah, hopefully we'll look forward to seeing that.
5207340	5212140	Alright, well I have some quick topics for you guys here, and one of them has to do with
5212140	5215940	a game that's unlikely to...
5215940	5219420	It's not one you would think is as played as it is, but what does WoW have?
5219420	5222580	World of Warcraft's got, what, 11, maybe 12 million players on it?
5222580	5223580	I think that's about right.
5223580	5226460	I think Warcraft is probably one of the biggest MMOs of that many people.
5226460	5229860	What if I told you there was a game with about seven times as many players on it playing
5229860	5231340	right now?
5231340	5232340	It's Farmville.
5232340	5235860	Yeah, that's right, there's a new story circulating game blogs this week.
5235860	5236860	I hate that game.
5236860	5242620	Farmville has passed 80 million users, 80 million.
5242620	5244300	That's like a country, okay?
5244300	5245940	That is a huge amount of people playing Farmville.
5245940	5250380	Now I don't know if that necessarily means people regularly playing Farmville, because
5250380	5251380	I know...
5251380	5253620	Okay, look, I'll admit, I tried it out many months ago.
5253620	5254620	Don't judge me.
5254620	5257100	I tried it out many months ago just because I had friends that were playing, and you know
5257100	5260420	you get so much spam on your Facebook, you're like, well gee, if so many of my friends are
5260420	5261900	playing it, there must be something about it.
5261900	5266660	Yeah, I played it for about, not even a month, maybe two weeks, and it was like, what?
5266660	5267900	What am I doing?
5267900	5268900	This is ridiculous.
5268900	5273500	Yeah, so Farmville, of course, 80 million people playing Farmville.
5273500	5278620	Look, whether you love or hate Farmville, it certainly goes to show that Facebook as
5278620	5280620	a gaming platform should not be discounted.
5280620	5282220	I mean, that is a huge amount of people.
5282220	5286060	No word as to how many spam messages those 80 million people have sent their friends
5286060	5287060	about.
5287060	5291180	I don't know, sign up for this and get a million farm bucks or whatever it is, I don't know,
5291180	5294900	so I can get a super cow to make lots of milk or whatever they do.
5294900	5295900	Super cow.
5295900	5296900	Super cow.
5296900	5298700	I see all this bullshit all the time.
5298700	5303260	I get all these group invites like, join me now in Farmville so I can get my honeycomb
5303260	5304260	or whatever.
5304260	5305260	I hid all of those.
5305260	5306260	Oh my gosh.
5306260	5308380	No, I get like group invites to my email.
5308380	5309500	I mean, ugh.
5309500	5313660	I just report him for abuse every time.
5313660	5314660	I just get irritated.
5314660	5319140	But see, yeah, I mean, actdeft in chat room brings up a good point, Bejeweled Blitz greater
5319140	5320520	than Farmville.
5320520	5323540	I will admit, I still play Bejeweled Blitz like a lot.
5323540	5325180	Like Alan, you watched me play the other day.
5325180	5327380	Like I was like, oh, I gotta get my score in for the week because I want to get entered
5327380	5329020	in for a laptop.
5329020	5335900	And uh, yeah, I have Bejeweled Blitz on my phone and well, you know, like they put Lexulus
5335900	5340580	on there, which is my Scrabble game and I do Scrabble solitaire on it.
5340580	5342380	That's right now the only game I still play.
5342380	5347900	I mean, I still have a pet society, but I mean, seriously, all the other of those games
5347900	5349540	are just completely ridiculous.
5349540	5351020	Like sorority life.
5351020	5352580	I rolled my eyes out.
5352580	5353580	Guilty.
5353580	5354580	I know.
5354580	5355580	Guilty.
5355580	5358940	But I'm saying that the, you know, I quit that too.
5358940	5365140	I've tried some of them and I tried Farmville and I finally actually told people before
5365140	5370760	they had the hide, you know, all things from this application to just stop including me
5370760	5372680	on their little announcements.
5372680	5377120	You know, I would hunt down people and tell them, dis-include me.
5377120	5380860	Now there's a Facebook group that's like, I don't give a hoot or I don't give a shit
5380860	5384540	about your mafia, your farm or your, I don't remember what it is.
5384540	5385540	I joined that.
5385540	5386540	Or your sorority.
5386540	5390500	And then I'm kind of like, now that I'm watching all these people join this group, like it's
5390500	5391500	just funny.
5391500	5393580	The way Facebook works is interesting.
5393580	5394580	Of course.
5394580	5399260	My favorite of those groups is still, I bet this pickle can get more fans than Nickelback.
5399260	5404980	Wasn't there one that's like, I bet this more, this mobius strip can get more fans than itself.
5404980	5407140	I saw a group called that or what.
5407140	5408140	There was another one.
5408140	5409140	I don't know.
5409140	5411020	There was one you joined this week or was that just a status update?
5411020	5416500	Alan, you put like, I bet that X can get more fans than Y or I don't remember what it said.
5416500	5417500	Something.
5417500	5418500	Yes.
5418500	5421660	I bet this at VAR can get more fans than pound foo.
5421660	5423140	Like just variables.
5423140	5424140	Programming joke.
5424140	5425140	Yes.
5425140	5426140	Got it.
5426140	5427140	That's a very high level nerd joke.
5427140	5428140	That might be too high brow for the show.
5428140	5429140	Actually.
5429140	5430140	I don't know.
5430140	5431620	You might, you need to, you need to tone it down with some Dick and fart jokes.
5431620	5434860	Oh, Hey, uh, Starcraft two.
5434860	5437580	Hey, no better way to bring it to gaming than talk about Starcraft two.
5437580	5438580	Of course.
5438580	5440380	As you, I'm sure you've heard many other places.
5440380	5445780	The beta launched this week and uh, yeah, lots of people very eager to get in this game.
5445780	5447460	How eager are they?
5447460	5454960	So eager that they are paying up to $300 for Starcraft two beta keys to get into this game.
5454960	5459060	This is a, some of the tickets that were handed out at Blizzcon 2008 apparently.
5459060	5463860	Um, now they are selling for $300 as high as four 50 they've been spotted.
5463860	5464860	Wow.
5464860	5467300	I mean, uh, don't get me wrong.
5467300	5471500	I think Starcraft two is going to be kind of cool, but not $450 cool, dude.
5471500	5474580	I can wait like a month for the finished product or not a month, three months for the finished
5474580	5475580	product.
5475580	5479380	That's even a lot of good news at Blizzard camp.
5479380	5483860	Uh, right now though, Blizzard also this week has announced that their pandaren campaign,
5483860	5484860	that's right.
5484860	5488540	They were selling in game pets and world of Warcraft for 10 bucks to fundraise money for
5488540	5489540	the make a wish foundation.
5489540	5490540	Yeah, I bought one.
5490540	5491540	Shut up.
5491540	5492540	Don't judge me.
5492540	5494500	Hey, I helped contribute to a cause that overall raised.
5494500	5501300	They are announcing $1.1 million was raised by the pandaren monks.
5501300	5505340	And uh, that was such a big donation was actually reported in the OC register, which is a pretty
5505340	5510100	big, uh, um, newspaper in orange County, which you may know or not know.
5510100	5514100	That's where Blizzard is headquartered, which you also may not know about orange, orange
5514100	5515100	County.
5515100	5519640	I believe there is an art gallery there called the orange lounge that if you Google like
5519640	5523580	orange lounge, I think you put, I don't know if you put orange laundry or just like orange
5523580	5525660	lounge, you get that in your results.
5525660	5528420	Just kind of a lol what type of moment.
5528420	5533500	Uh, anyhow, the pandaren monks are still on sale, but you should know they are no longer
5533500	5536100	going towards the make a wish foundation.
5536100	5538140	That was just a limited time thing.
5538140	5542140	Hey, if you look up dark Sakura on Google, you get my deviant art page.
5542140	5543140	Do you really?
5543140	5544140	Yeah, you do.
5544140	5545140	Interesting.
5545140	5546580	I don't know what happens if you look up Rob Roberts.
5546580	5550920	I think you just get some random old guy cause like I did a picture search and I wasn't even
5550920	5552180	on page one, but that's okay.
5552180	5556380	I like, I like being a little bit of an image that comes up is of some girl that says dark
5556380	5557380	Sakura.
5557380	5558380	Well, you're fucked.
5558380	5562020	The second picture is me, um, seven years ago.
5562020	5563020	Oh wow.
5563020	5565300	I just think it was funny cause I like randomly doing that.
5565300	5566300	So let's see what we get on.
5566300	5570740	I'm going to actually do a search for orange lounge.
5570740	5573820	You have some rapid fire news stories to be reading young lady.
5573820	5574820	Yes I do.
5574820	5576420	And by the way, I found the orange lounge.
5576420	5577420	Nice.
5577420	5585100	So anyway, um, yeah, with, uh, the stuff I have, we've got, um, rock band releases coming
5585100	5594100	from him one night only, um, the police and Marilyn Manson.
5594100	5598660	So the him pack is heart killer, Oh, to solitude wings of a butterfly, which I don't give a
5598660	5599980	shit about.
5599980	5606660	And then we have a KSM, um, distracted Marilyn Manson, the dope show one night only just
5606660	5608940	for tonight and police walking on the moon.
5608940	5611580	And they're also available for Lego rock band.
5611580	5618060	Then we have, um, yeah, David Coverdale is kind of funny.
5618060	5625900	Um, they, he's not sure if there's going to be any white snakes songs coming on to, uh,
5625900	5627500	any of the music games.
5627500	5631900	The only one that I care about is, uh, here I go again because I mean, I'm sorry, that
5631900	5634580	song is just awesome.
5634580	5642020	And then, um, AXIS, um, is, uh, bringing back the Kunio-kun series.
5642020	5650620	We um, they are going to be, um, localizing Kunio-kun no Cho Nekketsu Dayan Dokai, which
5650620	5653460	is Kunio's extreme hot-blooded athletic meet.
5653460	5657620	And for those who do not know, the Kunio games are the river city games.
5657620	5662280	So they are actually adopting the river city name to release these under.
5662280	5667320	So we get river city super sports challenge and river city soccer hooligans, river city
5667320	5668320	dodge ball.
5668320	5669320	Yeah.
5669320	5670320	Super dodge ball brawlers.
5670320	5671320	Sweet.
5671320	5672320	So that's it.
5672320	5675940	All right, let's get into some Twitter topics, folks.
5675940	5679540	We always invite your Twitter topics at twitter.com slash O L R.
5679540	5681460	We're going to read some of your tweets.
5681460	5684060	Show us your tweets.
5684060	5685060	Let's see.
5685060	5689260	Uh, our first tweet tonight comes to us from, um, I think that story's coming up a little
5689260	5690260	later.
5690260	5694580	Let me do this one for stir lock that says, do you guys use Comcast having connection
5694580	5695900	issues here as well?
5695900	5698260	Uh, I believe the studio is on Comcast, right?
5698260	5699260	Yup.
5699260	5702060	In fact, I think Comcast in the Sacramento area is really one of the only options.
5702060	5707440	There's another provider called SureWest for parts of like, they suck here west Sacramento
5707440	5708440	ish.
5708440	5710420	I think they're really popular, but not a lot here.
5710420	5713500	And um, the U-verse I don't think really exists here.
5713500	5714700	Yeah, we don't have U-verse.
5714700	5717860	I tried to look, I looked up all of those for my new apartment cause I want to, you
5717860	5720100	know, competitively price and see who can give me the best deal.
5720100	5725220	Comcast was my only option, but it looks like the internet's running fine now.
5725220	5726220	So whatever.
5726220	5732840	Um, let's see, uh, got a message from alpha Kananagram that's, uh, pointed us to this
5732840	5734980	news story, uh, on joystick.
5734980	5739340	I want to make sure this isn't coming up later in the show cause I didn't familiarize myself
5739340	5743900	very well with the show world tonight, but it has to do with Nippon Ichi.
5743900	5748660	The president over there is going to be resigning apparently at the March 31st.
5748660	5753580	Nippon Ichi president Tomohiro Sato said that he is stepping down from his managerial post
5753580	5755300	on March 31st.
5755300	5759240	He's saying it is because of personal reasons, but just a coincidence.
5759240	5763900	It happens to be that Nippon Ichi recently announced that they are facing a big financial
5763900	5764900	decline.
5764900	5765900	Uh-oh.
5765900	5766900	Yeah.
5766900	5770740	The personal reason is, uh, I got to get off the sinking ship quick.
5770740	5773480	Hopefully things are able to turn around there.
5773480	5777620	And also another tweet to us from actdeft saying, can someone buy me this please?
5777620	5781580	And he links us to a story on Kotaku that talks about pre-ordering the Final Fantasy
5781580	5785860	13 soundtrack, 85 tracks on four CDs.
5785860	5789100	Uh, you can also get that on the North American Squeenix store.
5789100	5792900	I'm sure it's going to be available through iTunes as well, but what a nice little collector's
5792900	5794340	edition that would make.
5794340	5796340	So there you go.
5796340	5797340	Nice.
5797340	5799060	I don't know.
5799060	5801700	I haven't really heard a lot of the music from Final Fantasy 13 yet.
5801700	5805340	Just the Leona Lewis song, but that's because that's on her CD anyway.
5805340	5807200	So you can hear the little clip on iTunes.
5807200	5810080	So I haven't really heard the actual music music from the game yet.
5810080	5815580	So, but I did see of all places I saw on Oh No They Didn't this week, which if you've
5815580	5819420	never heard of Oh No They Didn't, Alan, help me describe Oh No They Didn't.
5819420	5820540	You've been a member longer than I have.
5820540	5821580	How would you describe it?
5821580	5823500	It's the largest community on LiveJournal.
5823500	5828820	It's so, it's so large that during, um, major news events, it'll actually crash the site
5828820	5833060	for one community that's totally nonprofit and they don't make any money off of it, but
5833060	5835700	it's just celebrity gossip and media news.
5835700	5837780	So it's just, you know, celeb lols basically.
5837780	5838780	Yeah.
5838780	5842180	Uh, and lots of great animated gifts are the whole reason to be on Oh No They Didn't.
5842180	5845000	You find the best animated gifts you're going to find anywhere on the internet there.
5845000	5849180	So anyway, um, Oh No They Didn't had a story about somebody posted the actual video on
5849180	5856500	YouTube of Leona Lewis playing Final Fantasy 13 and it was kind of awkward to look at like,
5856500	5860860	you know, she's really cute and everything, but her lines sounded really fed.
5860860	5864540	Like I don't, let me see if I can find that video really quick, um, before we get to the
5864540	5868580	next news story here, maybe I'll have Loki do a new story real quick while I try to find
5868580	5873060	the video and then I'll come back to this cause it's, you got to hear this cause I don't
5873060	5874060	know.
5874060	5878700	Like as, as, as precious as Leona Lewis is, I can't really think of a good verb or adjective
5878700	5884420	to describe Leona Lewis, but a precious, what seems to be one, uh, her lines sound really
5884420	5885420	forced.
5885420	5887320	So I've got, I got to try this.
5887320	5889820	By the way, uh, Kuma JP in chat is saying quite good.
5889820	5891420	Apparently the music is quite good.
5891420	5897060	So chat at orange on radio.com you want me to go ahead and do this story where I try
5897060	5901640	to find that YouTube, um, to kind of go back to what we talked about last week with the
5901640	5906580	Xbox live arcade block party, um, got some pretty good games coming out during the month
5906580	5907580	of March.
5907580	5912260	Um, now we do have dates for all of them, so you can plan accordingly.
5912260	5917740	And to recap, uh, March 3rd, we're going to see the release of toys soldiers for 1200
5917740	5921580	Microsoft points or $15 in real money a week after that.
5921580	5927260	So March 10th, we'll have a scrap metal, which is kind of a top down racing game.
5927260	5931660	No one really care though, because that's the same week as I believe final fantasy 13.
5931660	5937060	Um, and that's also 1200 Microsoft points or $15 on March 17th.
5937060	5945700	Uh, there will be the, um, perfect dark, uh, Xbox live arcade game coming out for $10 or
5945700	5951880	800 Microsoft points, and then finally, of course, as expected, uh, March 24th, the game
5951880	5954740	room hub will be available, uh, for no charge.
5954740	5961340	Of course, the games will run on their 400 Microsoft points or $5 for a PC and Xbox 360
5961340	5962500	friendly version.
5962500	5968740	Or if you want to license them for one system, 240 Microsoft points or 40 Microsoft points
5968740	5970980	for a single play.
5970980	5972780	I am so excited about game room though.
5972780	5973780	I think it's going to be fun.
5973780	5977220	And I, and I hope there'll be people that want to have competitions on the old school
5977220	5978220	games with me.
5978220	5981980	Cause I think I'll buy some of them, but I'm not going to buy like, I'm definitely not
5981980	5983740	buying all the games that I've had.
5983740	5984740	Definitely.
5984740	5985740	No, I refuse.
5985740	5988220	I will not buy a game that was already out on Xbox live.
5988220	5991180	Although I will ask this cause I don't see a story on this anywhere else.
5991180	5992420	And I read this earlier this week.
5992420	5995900	Did you hear about how apparently some of the midway games have disappeared from Xbox
5995900	6000940	live completely, uh, joust and smash TV, like pretty much anything that was connected to
6000940	6001940	midway gauntlet.
6001940	6002940	Oh, they're gone.
6002940	6003940	They're gone.
6003940	6004940	They're not on Xbox live.
6004940	6005940	You cannot buy them now.
6005940	6009420	Now they swear up and down, or at least on major Nelson's blog, it swears nothing to
6009420	6010460	do with game room.
6010460	6011860	It's a licensing thing.
6011860	6014900	And maybe that has to do with like the Warner brothers acquisition, but I don't know.
6014900	6018060	I kind of look at that and go, okay, uh huh, sure.
6018060	6020160	I think it has to do with midway being gone.
6020160	6024140	I think that's what it is because now, but seriously, if Joe shows up on game room, aren't
6024140	6028660	you going to be like, you just get, I'm sorry, I gave a visual, but aren't you just kind
6028660	6032660	of like hanging around to go really not going to be really, I don't think that's the reason
6032660	6033660	why.
6033660	6037420	I mean, first off, I can't imagine those games are really popular right now as far as purchases
6037420	6038420	go.
6038420	6039420	But they're classic.
6039420	6040780	I mean, smash TV is a classic.
6040780	6046800	I understand that, but you know, at the same time, I guess maybe they could be doing that,
6046800	6049940	but it, I don't think it's going to matter because there's going to be Pac-Man and the
6049940	6054780	Namco games aren't going away on, you know, Xbox live arcade, Konami games, I don't know.
6054780	6055780	Konami games.
6055780	6056780	Frogger.
6056780	6057780	We'll always have Frogger.
6057780	6059900	So I don't, you know, great.
6059900	6063260	Um, so I don't doubt that.
6063260	6068100	I don't think that's the reason why is that, you know, because they're putting them on,
6068100	6071540	on that service, but well, we'll see.
6071540	6076340	Uh, and I, I, I, good question from act JEFT in our chat room, Joust, then what will happen
6076340	6078780	with those Xbox live 12 month game codes?
6078780	6082460	I guess they're screwed or maybe you'll get the point.
6082460	6088940	Well, the first off, so you know, the Xbox live 12 month game codes that are, you know,
6088940	6090340	that come with free games and stuff.
6090340	6092140	Um, I think they switched out those games.
6092140	6093140	Yeah.
6093140	6094660	They probably switched out Joust a long time ago.
6094660	6096340	They do new versions all the time.
6096340	6100700	And the same thing, you know, they may be off the marketplace, but those codes may still
6100700	6101760	redeem it.
6101760	6105000	And if you've already downloaded it and need to redownload it again, they're still up there.
6105000	6106000	So they're on their servers.
6106000	6107000	Yeah.
6107000	6109020	And your game doesn't stop working just because it's gone.
6109020	6113340	So it, it, it may not matter that those game codes are in there.
6113340	6115700	Do you know how many of those freaking games I bought?
6115700	6119220	Like I think what I want to do tomorrow is just go in when I have internet again, I'm
6119220	6123600	going to go in and actually just play Joust and Smash TV and all those games you can't
6123600	6129100	get anymore just to fill up my gamer card to go, nah, nah, nah, I have them cause I'm
6129100	6130100	weird.
6130100	6131100	All right.
6131100	6133460	Uh, let's go back to something I was mentioning earlier.
6133460	6136860	This video is only a minute 13 so I'm going to go ahead and play it in studio.
6136860	6143140	This is Leona Lewis talking about Final Fantasy 13 and this is on YouTube user Gamerspawn,
6143140	6147460	although I'm guessing he probably just stole it from the, uh, official Squeenix YouTube,
6147460	6149260	but this is just who I'm playing it from.
6149260	6150700	So whatever.
6150700	6151700	So here it is.
6151700	6153700	Leona Lewis talking about Final Fantasy 13.
6153700	6158780	There's a little, here we go.
6158780	6160780	Pretty amazing.
6160780	6162780	graphics are insane.
6162780	6177140	She just did this little like, yes thing with her little hand, like a little fist.
6177140	6180780	Like I don't know how many times I've been playing Final Fantasy where I went, yes, but
6180780	6182180	that couldn't have looked any more forced.
6182180	6186420	I just, just point out, I have to say I have though thrown down my controller and gone
6186420	6187780	out for fuck's sake.
6187780	6188780	Exactly.
6188780	6189780	That's what I want.
6189780	6190780	That's what I want to see.
6190780	6203780	I want her to throw her controller at the window like fucking monster will be funny.
6203780	6204780	What do you want to bet?
6204780	6207620	Like she might be holding the controller, but somebody else off camera is holding the
6207620	6213260	real controller and playing the game so they can show her playing the game.
6213260	6214260	Cool.
6214260	6215260	Cool.
6215260	6216260	Amazing.
6216260	6221060	I don't know until I run around the land all day.
6221060	6222060	Hi everyone.
6222060	6225700	I'm thrilled to be collaborating with Square Enix on such a groundbreaking game.
6225700	6231060	I never would have imagined my hands as such a perfect fit for Final Fantasy 13, but the
6231060	6235860	strong female protagonist struck a chord with me and I can't wait to see lightning do her
6235860	6236860	thing.
6236860	6237860	No one talks like that.
6237860	6241260	In anticipation of the much awaited launch of Final Fantasy 13 and on behalf of Square
6241260	6247740	Enix, please join us in celebration of the launch of Final Fantasy 13 on March 9th.
6247740	6251780	It's like I can see her eyes reading off the cue card as she's saying.
6251780	6254500	No one says protagonist.
6254500	6256900	Well unless you're a literary nerd.
6256900	6257900	And she's not.
6257900	6259940	I could run around the land all day.
6259940	6260940	This game is awesome.
6260940	6261940	It has a wonderful story.
6261940	6264020	I want to run around the field.
6264020	6266460	It's like, come on, what is wrong with me?
6266460	6269700	I see something sparkly.
6269700	6275780	In defense of that, in defense of the running around all day thing, I have been doing a
6275780	6279260	lot of that in Star Trek Online just to see, oh I wonder if this planet's here, oh I wonder
6279260	6280260	if this planet's here.
6280260	6281260	But that's an MMO.
6281260	6286140	And the funny thing is, Final Fantasy 13's kind of been getting a little slack for how
6286140	6287780	linear it is.
6287780	6292320	Like I've heard it's kind of like, you don't have towns and the dungeons are not, you know,
6292320	6293500	it's a little more linear.
6293500	6294940	Although I've heard good things about the game.
6294940	6295940	It's just a little different.
6295940	6298860	So it's just funny to hear her say, I could just, I could just run around all day.
6298860	6300260	I could just do that.
6300260	6302660	I could just run around all day because that's all I know how to do.
6302660	6308180	I could run around all day long and annoy the fuck out of my significant other who's
6308180	6311140	watching me play this game and go, what the fuck are you doing woman?
6311140	6314300	Did you want to say something Alan?
6314300	6318820	I was going to say it's the only way really one of her singles is going to sell two million
6318820	6319820	copies here.
6319820	6322020	Is that she attaches it to that video game.
6322020	6324820	Well no because then all the, all the stuck up people are going to be like, oh well the
6324820	6328620	Japanese version's better because you know, everything.
6328620	6334060	You know who actually had, I think to this date had the best final fantasy song ever.
6334060	6335740	And that's Angela Aki.
6335740	6342520	I'm sorry that hers was, was such a crap game, but kiss me goodbye was a great song and it
6342520	6343520	launched her career.
6343520	6345420	Was it, was that was nine, right?
6345420	6346420	Yes.
6346420	6348060	But I don't, I don't think nine was a crap game.
6348060	6349060	It was one of the better places.
6349060	6351580	It was better than eight.
6351580	6356400	The thing about nine is it just kind of like, if I remember right, you know, this is many
6356400	6360780	years ago, but if I remember right, nine just kind of showed up like just out of nowhere,
6360780	6362300	like, Hey, Final Fantasy nine's out.
6362300	6363300	Like, Oh wow.
6363300	6365280	And then it was like, Hey, fanservice fanservice.
6365280	6367340	And then Hey, the PS2 is out now.
6367340	6370020	Like it was kind of the same thing that Final Fantasy happened with Final Fantasy 12.
6370020	6372380	But it was like, Hey, here's Final Fantasy 12 finally.
6372380	6374780	Oh, but the Xbox 360 and PS3 are out now.
6374780	6375780	Darn.
6375780	6381400	Well, I meant, and I'm not saying it was a bad game, I'm not saying crap game was more
6381400	6383460	like I lost interest in it.
6383460	6389800	Like I got to the, I got on the airship and I was done, you know, when you first escape,
6389800	6395360	but it had the best song, uh, SSJ 100 Matt in our chat room saying, looking at the video,
6395360	6397260	she is using the player one controller.
6397260	6398260	Yeah.
6398260	6401020	But see, if they're smart, if they're really smart, they have another system that it's
6401020	6407980	sync to, and then they have the other controller sync to the other one they thought I had an
6407980	6410380	idiot could play a Final Fantasy game.
6410380	6414280	And after all, she did say that she liked running around the field.
6414280	6417640	So maybe they just put her down and maybe that was, she was just running around the
6417640	6418640	field.
6418640	6419640	Okay.
6419640	6420640	Look, I like Leona Lewis.
6420640	6421640	She's precious.
6421640	6422640	She can.
6422640	6425520	Why are we picking on Leona Lewis?
6425520	6426520	She's defenseless.
6426520	6428560	She's like, it's like, it's like, we're kicking Bambi.
6428560	6430240	Like making fun of Leona Lewis.
6430240	6431240	We're not making fun of Leona Lewis.
6431240	6433020	We're making fun of the song.
6433020	6434020	She did an avatar.
6434020	6436020	How forced that video was.
6436020	6438400	I don't mind the Final Fantasy 13 song.
6438400	6442880	Like I think it, I don't, I think the trailer is kind of weird with all the stuff blowing
6442880	6451820	up and it's like, you know, like explosions and motorcycles, you know, it's like, it doesn't
6451820	6452820	really fit.
6452820	6460200	I can put that song then as my battle music in Final Fantasy 14.
6460200	6468000	When you're attacking a level 75 bunny, crushing your neck,
6468000	6473320	Yipping your head off.
6473320	6475000	I don't like doing falsetto on the show.
6475000	6481680	Hey, let's talk about iTunes and iPhone because of course the iPhone, whether a Loki likes
6481680	6484280	it or not, is another gaming platform.
6484280	6488280	And apparently, um, but nevermind.
6488280	6489280	Okay.
6489280	6494280	Apparently there's this game out on the iPhone that folks are getting a little crazy about
6494280	6498040	and it's a wobble eye boobs.
6498040	6506200	This program got, use your imagination folks, $30,000 is how much this game made last year,
6506200	6512040	but it was now being removed because you know, people were complaining about the sexual content.
6512040	6516940	Apparently some of the rules that were given as to what is not supposed to be in your app,
6516940	6524160	no images of women in bikinis, no images of men in bikinis, no skin, uh, no silhouette
6524160	6529600	that indicate that wobble can be used for wobbling boobs, no sexual connotations or
6529600	6535440	innuendo, boobs, babes, booty sex, nothing that can be sexually arousing and no apps
6535440	6538960	will be approved that in any way imply sexual content.
6538960	6544200	By the way, the guy asked us since no skin is a cited as a reason this app was pulled.
6544200	6551500	He asked if a burka was okay, but the Apple guy apparently got angry at that.
6551500	6552500	I don't know.
6552500	6555040	Do you think, uh, Apple has a right to be removing these ads?
6555040	6556040	It's gone.
6556040	6557040	Huh?
6557040	6558040	It's gone.
6558040	6559040	Oh yeah, it's gone.
6559040	6560040	Do you think Apple has a right to be taking this stuff down?
6560040	6561040	Or is it free speech?
6561040	6564160	I think they have a right, but I think at the same time they should offer this kind
6564160	6565160	of content.
6565160	6568280	I mean, just maybe locked somehow.
6568280	6570680	You can download a song called boobs.
6570680	6574720	And aren't there, aren't there apps about like farting and peeing and pooping and all
6574720	6575720	this stuff?
6575720	6576720	That's not nudity.
6576720	6579000	I'm sure there's apps about blowing people up.
6579000	6580000	It's not nudity.
6580000	6584080	It's not going to go in your pants pooping does involve nudity at some point this way.
6584080	6585080	Okay.
6585080	6591400	You can rip people's eyes out, but God damn it, if a boob shakes, it's over for you.
6591400	6593720	That's kind of messed up.
6593720	6595020	Should be equal across the board.
6595020	6597360	If you're going to have violent video games, which I don't know.
6597360	6598360	I don't know.
6598360	6601920	Apple's rules of violence, but you're going to have like, you know, the pooping calculator.
6601920	6606620	I think it's my next bowel movement should be mandatory mandatory for companies that
6606620	6612240	put out violent games, that there's equally as much sexual games out there.
6612240	6616900	So for example, you know, in a game like God of war that has lots of bloody violence, there
6616900	6621560	should be like just some really erotic game that they put out with no violence in it.
6621560	6622560	It's only fair.
6622560	6626480	Just make it prove that you're 18 in order to download the content.
6626480	6627480	Doesn't it kind of already do that?
6627480	6631340	Like I seem to remember like downloading some content and it'll say, this is a just might
6631340	6632340	be objectionable.
6632340	6636620	I think the keyboard cat app that I have, which will play keyboard cap at the cat at
6636620	6637620	the touch of a button.
6637620	6638620	It's amazing.
6638620	6643120	Uh, actually says this might contain mature content and are you have to be 17 or older
6643120	6644120	to continue.
6644120	6646000	It's keyboard cat.
6646000	6652000	I know, but I think that cats playing keyboard is offensive.
6652000	6654400	It's cruelty to keyboards.
6654400	6655400	What about dogs playing keyboards?
6655400	6657440	I don't give a shit.
6657440	6658440	Just curious.
6658440	6659440	You should play the bassoon.
6659440	6660440	I don't know.
6660440	6661440	What?
6661440	6662840	I think I said the bassoon for some reason.
6662840	6663840	I don't know.
6663840	6664840	What?
6664840	6665840	Where did the bassoon come from?
6665840	6667560	I think, oh, I mentioned the bassoon quartet earlier.
6667560	6668560	You're in a bassoon mood.
6668560	6669560	I see.
6669560	6670560	I see.
6670560	6672280	Rolf, the dog played keyboard before anyone.
6672280	6677880	So sorry, freaking keyboard cat app.
6677880	6678880	Now I have to download it.
6678880	6679880	I always got to bring it back to Muppets.
6679880	6686040	I mean, Rolf, the dog is used before keyboard cat.
6686040	6688040	Can I do a story?
6688040	6689040	Yes.
6689040	6693640	Speaking of iPhone and violence, yeah, Street Fighter IV is going to be coming on iPhone,
6693640	6695640	and I'm like, why?
6695640	6696640	Really?
6696640	6697640	Why?
6697640	6702200	So far, all we see is Ken and Ryu, nothing really in action.
6702200	6705200	They look kind of dinky and tiny.
6705200	6715400	I wasn't aware that the iPhone had a big 3D processor in it or anything, so whatever.
6715400	6721400	But in happier news for those of us who will play Super Street Fighter IV, we get some
6721400	6722640	Street Fighter III characters.
6722640	6731800	We get Ibuki, we get Makoto, and we get Dudley, as we mentioned, Rumor of the Week before.
6731800	6733680	So that's pretty cool.
6733680	6736320	And there's also this kickbox.
6736320	6741200	I was looking at the Japanese, I'm sure you saw what my wallpaper was of Sakura, but it
6741200	6744360	was a Super Street Fighter IV website.
6744360	6752960	There's also this Korean Taekwondo fighter who's just vicious.
6752960	6753960	Absolutely vicious.
6753960	6757120	They show this character beating up Sagat, and they never show anyone beating up Sagat,
6757120	6760240	so pretty crazy.
6760240	6762640	I didn't play a lot of Street Fighter III, admittedly.
6762640	6765920	Are these good characters to be bringing over, or is this kind of like, they could have picked
6765920	6766920	better ones?
6766920	6768720	Ibuki was my staple for Street Fighter III.
6768720	6769720	Same.
6769720	6770720	Yeah.
6770720	6771720	She's fast.
6771720	6774720	The only one who I actually would have really liked to see was Elena.
6774720	6776200	I think Elena was the one I used.
6776200	6778520	She's the one that kind of did like Capoeira type moves, right?
6778520	6779520	Yeah.
6779520	6780520	I used her when I played.
6780520	6781520	She was all leg.
6781520	6782520	Ah, very cool.
6782520	6786240	Kind of like Eddie in Tekken 4, right, or 3, 4, 1 of the 2?
6786240	6787240	3.
6787240	6789520	Because after that they got Christie.
6789520	6791440	So Street Fighter IV on the iPhone, huh?
6791440	6794080	They're talking about porting it to the PSP also.
6794080	6796080	It's going to be interesting.
6796080	6797080	You know what I-
6797080	6799080	I can see the PSP better than I can see the-
6799080	6800640	It makes more sense because it has buttons.
6800640	6807760	The screen capture, well the screen capture, this image that they had of it was like the
6807760	6812040	joystick and everything was on the screen.
6812040	6815520	So like, are you going to actually be able to see what you're doing?
6815520	6817100	No.
6817100	6818280	It's a bad idea.
6818280	6820560	They're going to make money off of it, it's a bad idea.
6820560	6823600	Well, you know what I think about Street Fighter IV coming to the iPhone?
6823600	6824600	Your mom?
6824600	6834920	Actually, no, that's the Muppet Babies theme.
6834920	6841080	I just had it stuck in my head ever since Alan mentioned Rolfe, so.
6841080	6843080	Let's jam to this a little bit.
6843080	6850600	Because it's going to be better than Street Fighter IV on the iPhone, let's face it.
6850600	6860240	Oh yeah, no, I don't care about Street Fighter IV on the iPhone, it's going to control like
6860240	6864000	shit until the Apple releases an actual joystick for the iPhone.
6864000	6865160	Who cares?
6865160	6867800	But I would download a Muppet Babies app, I would.
6867800	6870880	Well maybe you might be more interested in Fable III.
6870880	6874680	Fable III, they're talking a little bit about the co-op in the game.
6874680	6879860	And it sounds to me, even though they're claiming it's all new and stuff, it sounds just like
6879860	6885940	Fable II if you ask me, but according to an interview with Peter Molyneux during the Four
6885940	6892680	Guys 1UP podcast, they talked about the co-op system.
6892680	6900440	Basically if you go into someone else's game, you'll take your player, your player's dog,
6900440	6906640	the weapons that you've crafted as well, all the unique stuff that you've made will be
6906640	6907640	in the game.
6907640	6911520	So if you don't want to be tied into the person's camera, you could go off and do your own thing.
6911520	6916840	But of course, just like the second game, you want to be careful of who you invite in
6916840	6919760	your game because someone may come and rape all your women.
6919760	6920760	Just like, you know.
6920760	6922680	I hate it when that happens.
6922680	6923680	Yes, exactly.
6923680	6929360	Or it hits on the shopkeeper and they stop working.
6929360	6932520	I hate it when I leave my house and I come back and all the women got raped while I was
6932520	6933520	gone.
6933520	6935720	It's just, what a downer to your day.
6935720	6936720	Yes.
6936720	6941800	So, does Shermie like my jacket?
6941800	6949040	I think Shermie is confused at all the feet blocking access to her bed.
6949040	6950040	Shermie ran away.
6950040	6951040	Shermie's like, fuck this.
6951040	6952040	No, she didn't run.
6952040	6953040	She waddled.
6953040	6954040	I won't go get pie.
6954040	6957800	She waddled with her little shaking belly.
6957800	6965160	So just looking at this, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say Fable 2 and Fable 3,
6965160	6968000	probably not that much different from each other.
6968000	6969000	What a shock.
6969000	6976440	Despite all this hype, you know, much like the hype from Fable 1 to Fable 2, don't be
6976440	6978000	surprised if they're very similar.
6978000	6981840	Well, if I get to bring all this stuff into the game, can I bring Shermie into my game?
6981840	6982840	That's what I want to do.
6982840	6984880	What would she do?
6984880	6985880	Poop?
6985880	6987080	Not be able to run and catch up.
6987080	6991560	No, she'd find a towel that was laying around in your game and piss on it, which is what
6991560	6994120	she's been doing lately.
6994120	6996080	Fuck you to my cat.
6996080	6997920	We're not at that segment yet.
6997920	7001400	Anyhow, we'll get there, though.
7001400	7002400	We'll be there in a minute.
7002400	7007820	But first, I want to mention this story about a Darksiders demo that's coming to Xbox Live
7007820	7010040	and PlayStation Network on February 25th.
7010040	7011780	Apparently, it's a pretty extensive demo.
7011780	7016460	They're saying, THQ and Vigil Games, they're saying this demo is going to be 90 minutes
7016460	7022120	to complete for the average player, which means I'll be able to beat it in 30.
7022120	7023120	No, 120.
7023120	7025200	Yeah, 90 minutes for the average player.
7025200	7029920	Apparently, it's the entire first dungeon of the game and two bosses from the game.
7029920	7035920	So that's coming out on February 25th for the game Darksiders.
7035920	7040480	I guess they just wanted to see, wanted to really give you a whole in-depth look at the
7040480	7041480	game.
7041480	7042840	It seems like, why not?
7042840	7047840	You know, if a game is going to take 50 hours to complete, what's with giving away an hour
7047840	7048840	and a half for free?
7048840	7052840	They could have given away an hour and a half demo for Oblivion and people would just come
7052840	7053840	to you.
7053840	7054840	I mean, there's games.
7054840	7055840	Get people hooked.
7055840	7058640	Games like Saints Row where, you know, they had a half an hour demo, I played that demo
7058640	7059640	like 80 times.
7059640	7060640	It was awesome.
7060640	7061640	Yeah.
7061640	7062640	Get people hooked.
7062640	7063640	And then there you go.
7063640	7064640	Kill time until the game came out.
7064640	7065640	All right.
7065640	7068540	Uh, we're going to get into the mailbag section of our show.
7068540	7072880	Every time you guys send us emails at mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, we take a moment
7072880	7077920	during the show to rip open the mailbag and pick a few of our favorite emails to read.
7077920	7082080	Dark Soccer is going to dive into the mailbag at mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and read
7082080	7083560	some emails right now.
7083560	7085480	Hi guys, it's Sam S again.
7085480	7089200	I just wanted to say sorry about criticizing your haste when it comes to the feed.
7089200	7093400	The article about PopCap dumbass struck as potentially mind blowing.
7093400	7095800	I think I'm on the same rage level as Loki on this one.
7095800	7096800	The guy is a dumbass.
7096800	7101560	There is no reason PopCap reps need to say anything about the general gaming populace.
7101560	7104360	They have no fucking clue what the average gamer wants.
7104360	7109040	This guy needs to shut his mouth and also the iPad is a disgrace and I wish it would
7109040	7111200	be the downfall of Apple Go Microsoft.
7111200	7113640	Um, whatever.
7113640	7116080	Now this is- Can I respond to that real quick?
7116080	7120920	Like dude, you're welcome to your opinion and all that fun stuff, but like, okay, even
7120920	7128480	if the iPad fails, Apple still has ginormous business as a phone company.
7128480	7130080	I know that's not what they started as.
7130080	7134360	They started with those little green monitors that were in all of our grade school classrooms,
7134360	7138400	but they're a huge phone company now and yet computers and all that stuff too, but like
7138400	7143040	the phone thing is huge- The Mac is still the standard of the graphic
7143040	7144040	design industry.
7144040	7148640	But yeah, I do remember Loki going off on that one show that was kind of funny and yeah,
7148640	7149640	he had a point.
7149640	7152280	I'll, I'll, I'll meet you halfway there.
7152280	7154880	Now for the long ass email of the night.
7154880	7155880	Yay!
7155880	7156880	Hi, O.L.R.
7156880	7161660	I'm not sure how much help this email will be, but I was listening to your last two podcasts
7161660	7166160	and wanted to know what it would take to get the video game development companies to be
7166160	7167160	unionized.
7167160	7170640	I'm definitely no expert, but I work for a local in Chicago.
7170640	7174440	Although I have no say in the local's decisions or anything, I've been with them for a while
7174440	7176200	now and I've seen how things are done.
7176200	7178600	I also work closely with one of the largest unions in the US.
7178600	7182760	I'm not an employee, but I visit them every day and I see some of the big wigs on a daily
7182760	7183760	basis.
7183760	7187120	I'm no expert, but some of what they do has rubbed off on me.
7187120	7190320	At first I thought it involved simple factors like the size of a company or what percentage
7190320	7192520	of said company wants to be unionized.
7192520	7198000	I talked to some of the folks at work and they summarized what they said.
7198000	7202320	Those employees that want to organize need to sit down with the organizer and well, get
7202320	7203320	organized.
7203320	7209440	AFSCME, AFL-CIO, and SCIU are one of the biggest unions, SCIU dealing with USA, Canada, and
7209440	7210680	Puerto Rico.
7210680	7214000	One of the ladies at work said that the video game industry would probably fall under the
7214000	7218440	entertainment category, which should mean that all of the unions, the AFL-CIO is the
7218440	7219440	one to contact.
7219440	7222680	What they need to do is contact their closest AFL-CIO branch.
7222680	7227180	It all depends, although, because I don't know which video game company you had in mind.
7227180	7230600	If you were thinking EA, where a friend of mine works, they would need to contact the
7230600	7232280	Sacramento office or maybe San Francisco.
7232280	7233280	I honestly can't remember.
7233280	7235520	I didn't take notes and there's a link.
7235520	7242520	It's actually aflcio.org slash join a union slash how slash how to dot CFM.
7242520	7246880	Now you can end my email here, but I'd like to voice my opinion on this.
7246880	7250320	Protecting video game workers is probably supported by most gamers who feel they should
7250320	7253320	have fair work hours, pay, and everything else.
7253320	7259560	However, say there's a strike at Square Enix and it prevented the release of the newest
7259560	7262900	Final Fantasy game or strike at Capcom that's keeping the newest crossover fighting game
7262900	7264240	from coming out.
7264240	7266840	Will gamers still support the striking workers?
7266840	7268760	Who will gamers choose the product to the workers?
7268760	7272600	I honestly don't know what I'd want more to be honest.
7272600	7276000	Remember the writer strike that prevented new episodes of TV shows from premiering?
7276000	7279920	Were you reading for the writers or were you craving more episodes of lost or ugly Betty?
7279920	7280920	Oh wow.
7280920	7282120	My, my insertment.
7282120	7284240	I didn't care.
7284240	7285600	I don't, I don't really watch.
7285600	7289200	I know you don't watch a lot of TV, but look from the standpoint of somebody who was like,
7289200	7292320	I think the writer's strike kind of ruined heroes that show.
7292320	7296420	Well, the second season was already kind of poopy, but like, I don't know, like the writer's
7296420	7299560	strike really damned some shows that were on a roll.
7299560	7302720	I see, I see the point the email was trying to make.
7302720	7305880	It's a, it's a, it's a great point and one I didn't, one I didn't consider last
7305880	7306880	week.
7306880	7308320	That's why I'm glad we got emails on it.
7308320	7311840	But if companies also want to keep their product going, they need to have a quality work environment
7311840	7313760	for the people that are working for them.
7313760	7318480	You have to respect the worker, but to continue, I remember in high school after I graduated,
7318480	7322400	the teachers were striking for whatever reason, maybe pay, and they kept school from starting
7322400	7325720	on time, which meant the end of the school year was that much later.
7325720	7329400	The students were not happy and wanting, and one of the striking to end, not for the teacher
7329400	7331200	sake, but for their early release.
7331200	7336000	Who knows, I probably didn't want to be on the teacher side because teachers aren't
7336000	7338360	usually students' best friend, who knows.
7338360	7341480	So yeah, I wouldn't know, um, know what I'd go for.
7341480	7345960	If you support the workers, then be really sure you still support them, even at the cost
7345960	7348600	of the release date of a game you're really looking forward to.
7348600	7351920	Stan, Rob, it was nice to meet, it was nice meeting you when you came to ASIN.
7351920	7352920	I know I was kind of boring.
7352920	7353920	Oh, okay, okay.
7353920	7354920	I know who this is.
7354920	7359240	Well, that was a great email and, and, and brought up some points and, um, I don't,
7359240	7363480	I don't know if you told me you worked for a union, but that's really neat that, um,
7363480	7366280	to kind of see that side of it and kind of brought up some things I didn't think about.
7366280	7369020	Like especially, yeah, what would happen if they go on strike?
7369020	7372640	You know, we hear all these reports about conditions and again, I want to make this
7372640	7373640	clear.
7373640	7377480	I wasn't necessarily like supporting saying they should unionize, I was just kind of asking
7377480	7381040	the question, what about like, is it a feasible option?
7381040	7382040	Question mark.
7382040	7383040	I don't know.
7383040	7389160	You know, the only, the only way anything's going to change if, is, is if something is
7389160	7390160	done.
7390160	7394720	So I was just suggesting maybe union, is that something maybe then it's kind of neat to
7394720	7398880	get that email and think about that perspective is that, you know, if, if that were to happen,
7398880	7403080	uh, strikes would be a very real possibility and people already bitch and complain when
7403080	7407440	games are delayed, even if the game is being delayed for quality reasons.
7407440	7408440	You know?
7408440	7409440	Yeah.
7409440	7410880	A lot of people have been, I think Final Fantasy was a good example.
7410880	7415240	A lot of people have been given Final Fantasy some smack because 13 has taken forever to
7415240	7416240	come out.
7416240	7419880	But what if it had been delayed even more because of some type of, of workers strike?
7419880	7421680	That's a, an interesting point.
7421680	7422680	I don't know.
7422680	7427120	I would like to think me personally, I'm okay with the game being delayed as long as they're
7427120	7428840	going to put out a quality product at the end.
7428840	7431320	Like I was really looking forward to blur that was supposed to come out fourth quarter
7431320	7435160	last year, but they delayed it to this year because they want to make sure online wasn't
7435160	7436160	fucked.
7436160	7437160	And I'm okay with that.
7437160	7438640	I would rather they fix it than put out a crap game.
7438640	7439640	Oh, I agree.
7439640	7441640	I agree with that.
7441640	7446680	Um, there actually is one more email, um, about, uh, the unions.
7446680	7452280	Hey, O-O-L-R. I know we've been on this topic for three weeks now, so I will keep it short.
7452280	7456600	The problem with unionizing game developers is that unions cost extra money that game
7456600	7459120	publishers are just not going to be willing to pay for.
7459120	7461680	They'll just hire non-unionized employees.
7461680	7465480	Lord knows that there are enough people desperate to get into the industry by any means possible
7465480	7469520	that they will work god awful hours thinking they're the next best game developer since
7469520	7470520	Miyamoto.
7470520	7474640	Basically, as long as there are people to take advantage of, this will probably never
7474640	7475640	stop.
7475640	7478720	Unfortunately, it doesn't leave much room for people with families who don't want to
7478720	7481760	or simply can't work 12 hour days, seven days a week.
7481760	7485040	These people get suckered in by company lies when they say they're getting hired for the
7485040	7489980	job saying that crunch periods will only happen on a necessity basis.
7489980	7494540	The crunch period slowly becomes perpetual and if they don't crunch, they get fired.
7494540	7498360	The only light at the end of the tunnel I can see is if all the talent gets wise to
7498360	7501720	this sort of thing and the bottom is just going to fall out of the industry.
7501720	7505760	There are no senior level developers left and all you have is a bunch of hotshots with
7505760	7509160	a degree who don't actually know how to get a game out on time.
7509160	7513160	The EA's, Rockstar's, Activision's of the world need to realize that their employees
7513160	7517000	are really the ones who make the money for them and if they don't treat them well, they
7517000	7519040	won't have a leg left to stand on.
7519040	7520480	Hopefully I kept that brief enough.
7520480	7523980	As a programmer myself, I count my blessings for being employed by a company that lets
7523980	7529720	us go home at 7 p.m. though plenty of us stay later willingly and doesn't make us work weekends
7529720	7533120	and I think it's outrageous that there are situations like this right in my backyard
7533120	7535120	since I work in Silicon Valley.
7535120	7537880	Here's truly AZHP.
7537880	7541980	Well I wish we could name, I completely understand why you don't want to say who you work for
7541980	7548860	on a delicate subject like this so please, but I wish we could recognize whatever company
7548860	7555280	that is and go yay and pat them on the back for having kind of a good employee policy
7555280	7558060	like that.
7558060	7562280	Maybe that's what it's going to take is negative press for these companies like EA and whatever
7562280	7566120	else we've heard about with the nightmare hours to curb it.
7566120	7568200	Bad press is never really a good thing.
7568200	7569200	I don't know.
7569200	7570200	It's not an easy issue.
7570200	7575840	I think this second emailer makes a really good point about the whole people are dying
7575840	7577320	to get into the video games industry.
7577320	7582840	I mean most of those tester positions are like temps, they're temp jobs through contracting
7582840	7586880	agencies and that's how many people get their foot in the door which is why I think it's
7586880	7591520	hilarious that they're glamorizing the whole thing on this PlayStation 3 show, the tester
7591520	7593460	or whatever it's called that's coming out.
7593460	7595760	Now granted I haven't watched it yet.
7595760	7598280	You get to test Barbie soccer.
7598280	7602840	I'll look at it because I like reality TV and I like video games so you would think
7602840	7606680	I would like some and I like how sparks so you would think I'm all about something like
7606680	7609920	the tester but I just I know I'm not gonna like it.
7609920	7612840	I just know it.
7612840	7616520	But something like that kind of glamorizes what might not actually be that glamorous.
7616520	7620240	It's just a little hard watching a show that's basically a commercial shoved down your throat.
7620240	7621480	Did you watch it?
7621480	7624320	No, but I can guess what it's gonna be.
7624320	7626160	A giant commercial shoved down my throat.
7626160	7627160	Oh look it!
7627160	7629000	Let's test God of War 3!
7629000	7633920	Oh my goodness it's so epic and wonderful but look at all these bugs!
7633920	7634920	No it's not gonna be like that.
7634920	7639880	All it's gonna be is them stupid challenges that are game related and then they get to
7639880	7644460	talk about how awesome it was to get to play God of War 3 for anybody else.
7644460	7649640	You know what would make me watch the tester is if RuPaul was the judge.
7649640	7655480	You know and that at the end of every episode remember don't fuck it up.
7655480	7660560	It's time for you to lip sync for your life.
7660560	7664160	Seriously if you've never watched Drag Race it's like the best reality show on right now.
7664160	7665640	Well can I read the last email?
7665640	7666640	Of course.
7666640	7669520	Dear OLR, I have a pair of questions for Loki.
7669520	7675640	If I buy a banned modded 360 console and play a game with a patch, can I download the patch
7675640	7678840	and will the patch prevent me from playing a burned game?
7678840	7681360	I wholly understand if you refuse to answer this question.
7681360	7683760	Stay care entertainment.
7683760	7686400	Repeat that.
7686400	7688560	A banned modded 360.
7688560	7690560	Okay.
7690560	7693060	And has a game that patches released for it.
7693060	7698400	Can you download the patch and will the patch prevent you from playing the burned game?
7698400	7700840	No the patch will not prevent you from playing the burned game but you're not going to be
7700840	7703360	able to connect to live to download the patch.
7703360	7708080	So you would have to download the patch by some other means and then transfer it to your
7708080	7713840	hard drive and then yes you would be able to do that.
7713840	7715960	It's over!
7715960	7719640	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us emails.
7719640	7722040	I think that's the way Dark Soccer should end the mailbag every week.
7722040	7723040	It's over!
7723040	7727360	There is actually a website though that does carry all of the game patches that are out
7727360	7732200	there for Xbox 360 and you can download them all individually and search by title.
7732200	7736200	Unfortunately I do not remember what that website is but I know that if you do a search
7736200	7740120	on Google you'll probably be able to find it because I've seen it a few times.
7740120	7745600	But that would be the way to do it if you're going to bother patching a game.
7745600	7749920	Alright well now that the email segment is done it's time for us to get to the angst
7749920	7754640	but Dark Soccer ran out real quick so I guess let's just cover some gaming news.
7754640	7757000	We'll do the angst before Skypline tonight.
7757000	7759560	Okie dokie.
7759560	7763360	So let's see let's talk about a few naughty games.
7763360	7765180	Yay!
7765180	7766180	Naughty games!
7766180	7767400	Bubble Bath Babes 2?
7767400	7768400	Not quite.
7768400	7770280	This is actually Miss World Nude 2010.
7770280	7772960	This doesn't even really have a game involved with it.
7772960	7777560	I mean they're just, it's basically if Ubisoft were to release this today it would be probably
7777560	7780440	called My Masturbation Coach.
7780440	7782140	Press A C Tits?
7782140	7783640	Is that the name of the game?
7783640	7791000	No it's basically a game that tracks your masturbation and what not.
7791000	7795600	Wait is this like, instead of like My Fitness Coach or Wii Fit?
7795600	7796600	Exactly.
7796600	7798440	It tracks your...
7798440	7799440	Masturbation.
7799440	7800440	Ok.
7800440	7801440	Alright.
7801440	7809080	Do you have to enter it in manually?
7809080	7810080	Funny.
7810080	7815880	Anyways the game is from the game developer Waffle which they went right there because
7815880	7817520	their name is Waffle.
7817520	7819280	I can't compete with that.
7819280	7825480	The Eero title looks, let me butcher this real quick here.
7825480	7832800	Looks like a Migeti Ga Tomarane Boku 2.
7832800	7833800	I'm not even going to bother.
7833800	7837080	Are we talking like a Belgian Waffle or like an Eggo?
7837080	7838080	It's just Waffle.
7838080	7840080	Waffle, Waffle, Waffle.
7840080	7841080	Anyways.
7841080	7846440	That's going to be in a song someday I know that.
7846440	7849040	That's the code name of the game right there.
7849040	7850040	Waffle, Waffle.
7850040	7855160	Anyways so the game records important events or everyday events.
7855160	7858720	For example, today's play style, Socks Masturbation.
7858720	7865280	Yes, they give you inspirational methods of masturbation.
7865280	7871120	For example, number of times you've wanked today, total number of times wanked so far,
7871120	7877480	there is a graphical chart that has it all, time taken for ejaculation and average time
7877480	7878480	taken for ejaculation.
7878480	7881240	Is it animation with little dead sperm?
7881240	7883680	They've got like cute anime girls that are in there.
7883680	7884680	But it gets better.
7884680	7885680	It gets better.
7885680	7891160	And then of course they have a wonderful database where you can organize and track information.
7891160	7897040	Total time spent wanking so far, total number of ejaculations so far.
7897040	7901360	And then of course, oh this is even better.
7901360	7909600	And then they list innovative methods of masturbation you might have never thought about.
7909600	7914640	Including in the diagram here, it looks like that stuff cut out of foam and then someone
7914640	7917280	has like foam pieces in the tube.
7917280	7918280	I don't know.
7918280	7924560	Anyways, but then of course the game is sold with like a pocket pussy as well.
7924560	7925560	Oh!
7925560	7929400	I thought you just used the Wii Fitness board.
7929400	7931720	The Tenga Egg Wavy is what it's called.
7931720	7935320	I thought that's what the resistance strap was for.
7935320	7936320	Ripped for your pleasure.
7936320	7944240	I mean yeah, the cover, I mean it's just topless anime chicks all wet and thriving around.
7944240	7948440	There is no way you would not know what this game is about.
7948440	7952080	So yes, that is coming from Waffle in Japan.
7952080	7953080	Waffle!
7953080	7954080	Waffle!
7954080	7959240	I'm sorry, but it's just, I don't know if you've ever played my personal walking coach
7959240	7963320	on the DS, but you can actually connect to the internet and upload your steps to this
7963320	7967920	big online database that shows you how far the world has walked to the moon or the earth.
7967920	7973880	So you should be able to do the same thing here and show total lost productivity time.
7973880	7982080	I would imagine that the pedometer could probably be used in a slimmer fashion for this device.
7982080	7986600	Not gonna see this on DSiWare unfortunately.
7986600	7988800	Okay and then the other thing, there's a weird glitch that's actually...
7988800	7990160	But wait, there's more!
7990160	7992520	Yes, there is more.
7992520	7994480	No More Heroes 2, Desperate Struggle.
7994480	8001780	Of course there's a lot of sexual innuendo in the game, but there is also a save glitch
8001780	8007040	apparently that causes one of the female characters to appear completely naked.
8007040	8008920	I'm watching it.
8008920	8015600	And it's funny, it's basically because Travis in the game, the way he saves is by taking
8015600	8019960	a dump in like a toilet, and that's the animation that they show.
8019960	8027320	Well this chick that's in the game, she's actually taking a shower.
8027320	8029840	Well the glitch is that somehow she ends up in the middle of the...
8029840	8030840	Ew!
8030840	8033760	No, she does not take a dump in the shower.
8033760	8038360	A Shinobu.
8038360	8040160	I'll give you a moment.
8040160	8041160	She's not...
8041160	8042160	Well she's fake naked.
8042160	8046600	Yeah, it's Sims naked type of stuff.
8046600	8050680	But still, the thing is that she does not have clothes on and they cannot patch that
8050680	8051680	out.
8051680	8055560	Go Nintendo.
8055560	8059120	No word on how exactly to recreate the glitch, but it is on YouTube for those who want to
8059120	8061280	check it out.
8061280	8063600	Rob is having a real life segfault right now.
8063600	8065000	It's pretty amazing.
8065000	8072040	I can't get the image in my head of the game saving her pooping in the shower.
8072040	8074800	Like that's nasty.
8074800	8076480	That doesn't just watch down the drain.
8076480	8080680	He even calls it dropping a save.
8080680	8083080	I'm gonna go drop a save.
8083080	8093720	And SSJ100Matt threw out the requisite tub girl question mark in our chat.
8093720	8097520	No, it's not tub girl.
8097520	8098520	Meh.
8098520	8099520	Alright.
8099520	8101520	Ow, my stomach hurts.
8101520	8102520	Please.
8102520	8122320	Yeah, we need to do the FUs of the week now because I hurt from laughing.
8122320	8128160	FU to a bunch of little tiny minor things adding up to put me in the single worst mood
8128160	8130520	I have ever been in in ages.
8130520	8131520	Rob, breathe.
8131520	8132520	I'm trying.
8132520	8134520	I don't know why it's so funny.
8134520	8135520	Okay, I'm okay.
8135520	8136520	I'm okay.
8136520	8137520	Carry on.
8137520	8139520	You're still speaking like you've been kicked in the nuts.
8139520	8140520	Carry on.
8140520	8141520	We're fine.
8141520	8142520	Try to do a show.
8142520	8143520	Professional radio.
8143520	8144520	Uh huh.
8144520	8145520	Yeah, right.
8145520	8146520	We're professional.
8146520	8151800	And a secondary FU to my wrist because I've started crocheting again.
8151800	8156560	This problem with my wrist swelling on one of the tendons has actually come back.
8156560	8160640	I started using a thumb trackball mouse to get it to go away.
8160640	8164360	But no, I discovered that I like crocheting again and so now it's decided to come back
8164360	8167120	so I have to stop crocheting as often.
8167120	8168120	See?
8168120	8169120	Aww.
8169120	8171120	Ew, you can kind of see that.
8171120	8173960	Yeah, I'm going to take a picture of it and put it up online because I'm that kind of
8173960	8174960	exhibitionist.
8174960	8175960	Wanna see?
8175960	8182600	Who wants to see my big bump?
8182600	8185240	Careful waffle entertainment might put that in their next game.
8185240	8186240	Loki.
8186240	8189600	Uh, empty my cold.
8189600	8191400	I hate coughing.
8191400	8193240	It's tough.
8193240	8194720	Um, I don't know.
8194720	8195720	I'm not super angsty.
8195720	8200000	FU to that not funny image that made me not stop laughing.
8200000	8207080	Um, FU to just, um, moves taking me like three weeks to accomplish moving.
8207080	8210900	Although everything was really smooth with the big furniture today, I still have so much
8210900	8211900	stuff to clean.
8211900	8212900	So FU to cleaning.
8212900	8213900	Grrr.
8213900	8214900	Argh.
8214900	8218920	Um, Alan, do you have any FUs of the week you'd like to share with our audience?
8218920	8226120	FU to having to, uh, job search or super serious rather than just casually having to find another
8226120	8227120	job.
8227120	8230600	Do you want to try sharing some of your talents in case anyone's looking to hire somebody?
8230600	8233640	You can always get a job as a video game tester.
8233640	8234640	Oh yeah.
8234640	8235640	Yes, he's breathing.
8235640	8239640	I think he qualifies.
8239640	8240640	So all right.
8240640	8244600	Uh, let's go ahead and, uh, let me do another story for you guys here from, uh, one more
8244600	8248880	story and then we're going to open up the Skype line at one eight seven seven game O
8248880	8253320	L R username on Skype is orange lounge radio, but we do have one more story and it's about
8253320	8258640	a new video game movie in the works and that movie missile command.
8258640	8260160	Yes, that's right.
8260160	8263920	Missile command apparently is being made into a movie at least.
8263920	8264920	Well, I don't know.
8264920	8268160	A lot of things they say are going to get made into a movie, but don't really, but this
8268160	8269220	is the latest one.
8269220	8273720	It's got more of a plot than monopoly, the movie and clue and all this stuff, right?
8273720	8274840	They were talking about previously.
8274840	8276160	They should not remake clue.
8276160	8277160	Clue was awesome.
8277160	8278160	The first time.
8278160	8281640	Well, apparently, uh, it's coming from the Los Angeles times that Atari is trying to
8281640	8286600	sell a missile command film to do whatever they want to try to make to a movie production
8286600	8289320	company, uh, to get the missile command movie made.
8289320	8291840	I don't know what it would be about, uh, but whatever.
8291840	8297960	It's gotta be better than like Armageddon was no word if yards revenge might become
8297960	8298960	a movie.
8298960	8299960	Who knows?
8299960	8300960	I don't know.
8300960	8301960	What kind of movie would you make at a missile command?
8301960	8307120	I don't know where either if I'm just going to be in the movie or not.
8307120	8308120	What's that?
8308120	8309120	A crappy one.
8309120	8310600	I don't know.
8310600	8311600	I don't know.
8311600	8312600	Whatever.
8312600	8313600	Yeah, of course.
8313600	8314600	It's not showing up.
8314600	8315600	That came up in chat.
8315600	8321360	Like two people asked is Mr Awesome, the star going back to some, uh, years old topics from
8321360	8324280	all games, radio, the network that we are on.
8324280	8328000	Let's get to the Skype line and quickly one eight seven seven game O L R. If you'd like
8328000	8331600	to give us a call right now, Skype line is open for business or you can give us a call
8331600	8335240	at username orange lounge radio on Skype.
8335240	8338120	We'll get to your calls in just a moment while we wait for those calls to come in cause there's
8338120	8339120	always a little bit of a delay.
8339120	8341040	We'll get to some last minute stories.
8341040	8342040	Loki.
8342040	8343040	Yes.
8343040	8346900	Uh, the new expansion for resident evil five also featured in the gold edition, um, has
8346900	8351480	an Easter egg where you can actually unlock the classic camera and you already talked
8351480	8352480	about that, didn't you?
8352480	8355960	No, that was one of my stories that you put in there.
8355960	8356960	Thank you.
8356960	8357960	Sorry.
8357960	8361640	You won't, you wanted to talk about that, but sorry.
8361640	8362640	Well how about something else?
8362640	8366440	I've got one on the ESRB site.
8366440	8368360	Q's working on a pixel junk racer.
8368360	8369360	Second lap.
8369360	8373480	There you go.
8373480	8377120	It appears that racers is the one that plays like a super sprint or whatever that old ass
8377120	8378120	Atari game is.
8378120	8379120	Right?
8379120	8380120	Yeah.
8380120	8381120	Okay.
8381120	8382120	I remember that one.
8382120	8383120	Yes.
8383120	8384120	Let's go to the phones.
8384120	8385120	We got a call.
8385120	8386120	Hi, you're on orange lodge radio.
8386120	8387120	Who's this?
8387120	8388120	This is the legend of Zaku.
8388120	8389120	What's on your mind?
8389120	8390120	Uh, nothing much.
8390120	8393120	Just recovering from another dull and lackluster weekend.
8393120	8398120	Um, yeah, I just, I think, I don't know if you've probably heard about this story that
8398120	8402640	was like hitting up the rounds on slash side and I think could, could talk to recently
8402640	8408100	about a company, but a video game developer who had, who had operations in Australia and
8408100	8413600	apparently since, uh, for some reason or another, we're trying to pull out of that country.
8413600	8419080	But before they did, they actually snuck into their, you know, to the Australian offices,
8419080	8424720	you know, their developers that they had down there, they snuck in and they actually, they
8424720	8429080	actually took the, the code, she took the, the IP from them.
8429080	8431680	Well, you know what I think about that?
8431680	8432680	What?
8432680	8440040	Uh, yeah, uh, no, I, I, well, I don't know.
8440040	8442920	What do you think is this, is this justice that they have a right to go in and steal
8442920	8444400	the code that they made or no?
8444400	8446920	Well, I mean, the whole situation is in a gray area.
8446920	8452320	I mean, you have on one hand, according to that, according to that company, which is
8452320	8460480	a inner zone, they said that because they use a third party HR firm, they basically,
8460480	8463840	they basically, you know, they're shifting the blame on them because they screwed up
8463840	8471720	all the, all the paperwork, legal paperwork with the Australian tax offices and especially,
8471720	8474880	you know, they're also blaming that country for not giving them the incentives that they
8474880	8480880	were, that they were owed for actually, for actually setting up operations there.
8480880	8484200	And then you see the developers, you know, with their other side of the story where they
8484200	8489680	were, you know, overworked and to the point where they didn't even get paid at all.
8489680	8495840	They were literally working without a paycheck, which I mean, this is the, this is one of
8495840	8500960	those, you know, unfortunate tales of the video game industry where you have a developer
8500960	8509240	that tries to like, you know, cut, cut corners, even though he's trying to make a, trying
8509240	8512760	to make, in other words, he's trying to make it, he's trying to make a quick dollar by
8512760	8517840	trying to outsource things that normally most companies would be able to take care of on
8517840	8518840	their own.
8518840	8521280	Zaco, do you wear a hard hat when you call on the show?
8521280	8522280	Not really.
8522280	8523280	Oh, I was just curious.
8523280	8527800	Um, well, you know, if they're working for this company though, and the company is paying
8527800	8531280	them to do a job and the job is to write code for this game.
8531280	8532280	Okay.
8532280	8533280	Okay.
8533280	8534280	Are you ready?
8534280	8538520	The reason why Rob was making banging noises is because that's what it sounds like when
8538520	8539520	you type.
8539520	8544920	Well, it's not my fault that the, the microphone is so close to the webcam on my Mac book.
8544920	8545920	All right.
8545920	8550360	I'm just saying that's why Rob was making the noises and asking about the hard hat.
8550360	8551920	I can't type fluently.
8551920	8552920	I'm more pecker.
8552920	8557240	Anyways, as we were saying, wait, did you just say you're a pecker?
8557240	8565000	I just, you know, you know, we, we give our favorite people the hardest time look in all
8565000	8569880	services to answer the question or to respond to the, I guess the story about it is that,
8569880	8575100	you know, there's a certain kind of like yay hero to the story about them going in and
8575100	8578040	stealing this code because the developers are screwing them over.
8578040	8582320	But the bottom line is, you know, they, they are signing the checks and paying them to
8582320	8584280	write code for this game.
8584280	8586240	And if you know, it doesn't work out.
8586240	8591320	It's still owned by the people who sign those paychecks, but when you actually go for months
8591320	8595940	without paying your employee and just try to shift blame, you know, not make any, any
8595940	8605020	valiant effort to rectify the situation that, I mean, the owners falls on that company labor.
8605020	8606960	Is this an American company?
8606960	8612200	It's basically an American company, which you know, has supposedly has a studio in Australia.
8612200	8614700	They'll get, they'll get the pants suit off of them anyway.
8614700	8620560	I mean, right now the Australian tax board, you know, as I said, they, they're, they're
8620560	8626540	owed lots of, you know, back taxes because, you know, as I said, if they outsource human
8626540	8632520	resources and payroll to an Australian company that didn't do their job, it's the parent
8632520	8637800	company's responsibility to make sure that those taxes are paid and everything is settled
8637800	8639360	in whatever country they're operating.
8639360	8643760	I mean, this is, this applies for any other company that sets a shop anywhere else.
8643760	8649080	They have to play by the local, you know, they had to play by the local, yeah, the play
8649080	8650800	by the municipality's rules.
8650800	8657320	Like if I were to set up something, you know, if I were to set up a company in another country,
8657320	8659020	I'll be under their jurisdiction.
8659020	8663960	So I'd have to make sure that my company was running legitimately over there.
8663960	8668000	It'll be interesting to see all the lawsuits that go back and forth on this whole thing.
8668000	8672520	But Zach, Zach, we gotta, we gotta wrap up and get to some other calls, but, um, thank
8672520	8673840	you very much for the call.
8673840	8674840	All right.
8674840	8675840	All right.
8675840	8676840	Later, dude.
8676840	8677840	All right.
8677840	8678840	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8678840	8679840	Who's this?
8679840	8682240	Um, hi, this is Elite Slayer.
8682240	8684840	Hey, Elite Slayer, what's on your mind?
8684840	8690600	Um, well, I was actually, um, on, I was on my laptop earlier and we were starting to
8690600	8697420	talk about the, um, Halo Reach beta and we, and then they were like, oh, and they wanted
8697420	8700280	to know more about, you know, like the Halo storyline.
8700280	8703020	And I know a lot about like bungee in the storyline.
8703020	8708880	And so we started talking about it and then, um, this guy came on and then we got into
8708880	8714920	this full blown argument about whether there were Spartans left in the Halo saga when like
8714920	8717700	Halo three was happening or not.
8717700	8724000	And I was on the side of that there was because, you know, just thinking master chief was,
8724000	8731120	um, he, and, uh, the whole storyline was kind of following him, but you never actually realized,
8731120	8734760	you know, kind of the other Spartans out there may have been left.
8734760	8740840	So, um, but the other guy was talking about this and I don't know where these facts are
8740840	8745920	coming up, but he said that, um, in Halo two and in Halo three, they're talking about how
8745920	8750560	he was the last Spartan and there was, um, no one else left.
8750560	8753440	And he was the only guy that could help this war.
8753440	8756840	And to be honest with you, I did not play Halo two.
8756840	8761880	Um, I mean, I've watched all the cut scenes and everything, but I didn't watch Halo.
8761880	8764600	I watched, I didn't play Halo two.
8764600	8769320	Um, even though, you know, I know it's, um, what's happening, you know, from the graphics
8769320	8773000	to the world's worst cliffhanger on there.
8773000	8778140	But um, I just seriously don't know, this is driving me crazy about whether there's
8778140	8784920	Spartans left, um, whether there was actually Spartans left in Halo three or there wasn't,
8784920	8791240	I mean, um, is there like a place in the storyline that actually says there is or isn't because
8791240	8795560	how they're talking about how in Halo reach that's new coming up, you know, you can play
8795560	8800640	the beta on May 3rd now, um, when it comes up, but how they're talking about how he had
8800640	8803560	a squad and then they're thinking they all died.
8803560	8804680	You know, I just don't know.
8804680	8807240	It's driving me crazy to be honest with you.
8807240	8810000	Out of curiosity, do you have your own show?
8810000	8811840	Cause you just talked for two minutes.
8811840	8814760	There was, is fascinating.
8814760	8815760	I mean, yeah.
8815760	8820920	Uh, you know, you can say I'm kind of the person that can, I can actually talk a lot,
8820920	8823840	but what I like to do for fun, like this may surprise you.
8823840	8825920	Um, I like to debate a lot.
8825920	8830800	I mean, I'm not kidding you.
8830800	8835140	People will, um, be like, they, after it's done, they're like, do you hate me now?
8835140	8836400	I'm like, no dude.
8836400	8837400	I just did that.
8837400	8838400	Cause I was pretty much bored.
8838400	8845320	I mean, that's it, you know, that's how, that's my personality to be honest with you.
8845320	8850720	But I don't, uh, lead Slayer, I'm going to answer your question quite, quite simply.
8850720	8851720	I don't know.
8851720	8859360	I, did you know, no, I wasn't paying attention to everything, but, uh, did you, um, happen
8859360	8864000	to catch the new Halo legends, uh, anime series that they had?
8864000	8866360	Cause there's a lot of, uh, different backstory stuff.
8866360	8871680	I think in there too, it might, um, yeah, I'll tell you this though.
8871680	8878200	Um, I saw, I saw the first four episodes of Halo legends and I looked at it and I'm like,
8878200	8882800	Oh my God, you know, I'm like, where, cause a lot of the stuff there, it does go along
8882800	8886960	the series, but then it's like some of the stuff, you know, it's like they're pulling,
8886960	8891080	just pulling out of their ass, you know, I'm like, where did this come from?
8891080	8896440	Because in, um, the third episode, they're riding these motorbike things, um, in like
8896440	8901120	space and, um, just doesn't make any sense.
8901120	8906480	Um, but, um, I'm starting to say I'm a lot, oh my God.
8906480	8907480	That's all right.
8907480	8908480	That's all right.
8908480	8909480	You're nervous.
8909480	8910480	It's a radio show.
8910480	8911480	Okay.
8911480	8912480	Wait before we got to wrap up here and go soon and I gotta be honest.
8912480	8915440	I don't know the answer to your Halo question, but maybe it's answered one of these books
8915440	8916440	or whatever.
8916440	8917440	Oh yeah.
8917440	8919800	There's books too on the whole Halo thing, but I want to, I want to debate you real quick
8919800	8920800	on a certain topic.
8920800	8921800	Okay.
8921800	8926240	Uh, since you're a big debate person, let's debate, uh, what, what is cooler keyboard
8926240	8929040	playing cats or keyboard playing dogs?
8929040	8930040	Okay.
8930040	8932040	And you start and take whatever side you want.
8932040	8937400	All right, dude, I got to go with, um, I, yeah, I heard your second on this earlier.
8937400	8942640	I got to say cats because just think cats, you've got low cap cats are crazy.
8942640	8946560	You got these animated gifts, you got all these things, you know, um, it's gotta be
8946560	8947720	one of a cool app.
8947720	8952120	Um, you know, everyone loves kittens, they're cute, they've got all this funny crap with
8952120	8953120	them.
8953120	8954120	They're swearing.
8954120	8957200	Kittens have, you know, they're just awesome.
8957200	8958200	Okay.
8958200	8960680	Well you're wrong and you're an idiot.
8960680	8961680	Okay.
8961680	8962680	Okay.
8962680	8963680	You're a liar.
8963680	8964680	Okay.
8964680	8965680	I got this.
8965680	8966680	Kittens are awesome.
8966680	8974440	I mean, I know I can sometimes be a dog person, but on, you know, online and iPhone, you know,
8974440	8975440	kittens are so much better.
8975440	8978360	They're funner, they lighten up your day.
8978360	8980400	I mean, they make you smile.
8980400	8981400	Come on.
8981400	8983400	It comes down to this.
8983400	8984400	Okay.
8984400	8989160	The easiest way you can determine which one's cooler, which is obviously cats, is because,
8989160	8991320	okay, dogs are trainable.
8991320	8992320	Cats are the untrainable.
8992320	8993320	Okay.
8993320	8997080	To train a cat to play a keyboard, well, force a cat to play keyboard.
8997080	8998080	Same thing.
8998080	9001200	Why are we even talking about this?
9001200	9002200	Why?
9002200	9003200	It's so much cooler.
9003200	9009680	At least Slayer, this has been a heck of a call, but I've got to let you go so we can
9009680	9011760	get some more, but thank you for your call to the show.
9011760	9012760	Yeah.
9012760	9013760	Take care.
9013760	9014760	Later, man.
9014760	9016400	You know what was awesome about that phone call?
9016400	9019820	Not a damn thing came of it.
9019820	9024120	We never even bothered to answer his question, but then he took two minutes to ask.
9024120	9025120	Dude, Wikipedia.
9025120	9026120	I don't.
9026120	9027120	Yeah.
9027120	9028120	Halo Wiki.
9028120	9029120	All right.
9029120	9034000	The whole chat room is going gong, gong, please end this, make it stop.
9034000	9036720	Why are you doing this to me?
9036720	9041480	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9041480	9042480	Who's this?
9042480	9046960	This is somebody that's not going to fap into a keyboard or sit there and get a stupid conversation
9046960	9048560	about stupid stuff like Halo.
9048560	9049560	Are you sure?
9049560	9051040	Oh, I'm definitely sure.
9051040	9052240	Dude, really?
9052240	9053240	What's on your mind?
9053240	9054240	Who is this?
9054240	9055240	What's up, guys?
9055240	9056240	This is excellent.
9056240	9057240	This is excellent.
9057240	9059320	Hey, X-Link, what's on your mind?
9059320	9061320	Nothing much, man.
9061320	9065880	Just getting ready to shoot myself in the head with DS, calling every... Oh, I'm not
9065880	9066880	going to get to it, seriously.
9066880	9067880	Hey, X-Link.
9067880	9068920	Just thinking about this.
9068920	9071120	It's the show where every gamer has a voice.
9071120	9072120	No, it's going to be soon.
9072120	9073120	It's going to be called.
9073120	9076080	The next time you go in a while, I'm going to put a hit on you with every single Horde
9076080	9080440	member going after you for surprise money for putting DS Master on the line.
9080440	9085000	It's going to be like an episode of the Guild, which, by the way, tangent, I watched the
9085000	9090120	entirety of season one and two of the Guild last night with Alan, because everything was
9090120	9093360	packed except for the computer, because if you're a nerd, the computer's the last thing
9093360	9094360	you pack.
9094360	9098480	So all I had was instant Netflix, because the PS3 was packed, all the DVDs were packed.
9098480	9099480	So we decided to watch instant Netflix.
9099480	9103360	I don't know if you know, but the Guild is now available seasons one and two on Netflix,
9103360	9106280	and you just kind of reminded me of one of the episodes where one of the guildies is
9106280	9111540	kind of leading a secret double life to make one of the other Guild members that she's
9111540	9113920	mad at make his life hell.
9113920	9114920	I don't know.
9114920	9115920	What did you think of the Guild?
9115920	9116920	Oh, I loved it.
9116920	9117920	I loved that show.
9117920	9118920	Oh, you've seen it, X-Link?
9118920	9119920	I'm sorry?
9119920	9120920	You've seen it, X-Link?
9120920	9121920	Oh, yes.
9121920	9122920	Yes, definitely.
9122920	9123920	Yeah.
9123920	9124920	I've seen both seasons.
9124920	9125920	Yes.
9125920	9126920	It's a little bit over the top for me.
9126920	9132560	Like, some of it's just, like, a little too out there, but, you know, for nerd lols, it's
9132560	9133560	pretty good.
9133560	9134560	What did you think, Alan?
9134560	9135560	You watched it too with me.
9135560	9136560	Did you like it, or was it a little like-
9136560	9137560	Yeah, it was good.
9137560	9140480	I've been on WoW for about two or three months, so I get all the jokes now.
9140480	9141480	Oh, there you go.
9141480	9144000	All right, what did you really call in to talk about tonight?
9144000	9151880	No, I was calling about Ubisoft and what bastardization they're doing with the whole DRM and stuff.
9151880	9155920	You know, like I said before, and besides the Imagination series and stuff like that,
9155920	9158800	don't forget they also did, like, the CSI series.
9158800	9164760	They were also part of, you know, the Press Your Luck, which, oh, yeah, thanks Ubisoft.
9164760	9167360	Now I can't now play any of those cool game show games.
9167360	9169360	You just hit a whammy.
9169360	9170360	Congrats.
9170360	9171360	Yeah.
9171360	9173080	So now you're going to stop me from playing Addis as well.
9173080	9176640	And my mom, because my mom likes a series of games, so you're going to make her stop
9176640	9179740	because she doesn't have an internet connection in her place, so.
9179740	9184200	Bravo on that, I know there's going to be a patch and there's going to be ways of getting
9184200	9187680	around it, so I'm not the least bit worried, but still, I mean, it's just the fact that
9187680	9190320	it's going to be a headache just before all that, you know?
9190320	9192160	And like you said before, it's going to be a headache.
9192160	9195940	You're going to have all these people who doesn't know all these different ways around
9195940	9196940	it.
9196940	9199400	They're going to sit here and they're going to— yeah, they're going to flood the support
9199400	9201040	lines because of all this, you know.
9201040	9204920	And you can't take a PC game back to the store, so best of luck on that.
9204920	9205920	Nope.
9205920	9206920	So, I...
9206920	9207920	I do...
9207920	9210040	Do you think, though, that it's gonna work?
9210040	9212680	I mean, don't you think it's just gonna get cracked within a couple days?
9212680	9213680	I mean...
9213680	9217240	Yeah, it will get cracked, but you gotta realize, too, a lot of people don't know this difference
9217240	9218240	of what we do.
9218240	9221460	And a lot of the people, I'm gonna feel bad for because they're gonna buy the game.
9221460	9222460	They're gonna open it up.
9222460	9223460	They're gonna put it in.
9223460	9224460	They're not realizing this is gonna happen.
9224460	9227920	And once they realize it's gonna happen, they're gonna try to take it back to the store and
9227920	9228920	they're gonna be like...
9228920	9230560	The store's gonna be like, sorry, that's tough.
9230560	9231880	You should have known that beforehand.
9231880	9234640	I think you and I are on the same page there.
9234640	9236720	You don't wanna debate me like the last caller did.
9236720	9237720	That's...
9237720	9238720	Nah.
9238720	9239720	Yeah.
9239720	9240720	Boring.
9240720	9241720	I know.
9241720	9242720	All right.
9242720	9243720	Well, what else is...
9243720	9244720	Sorry.
9244720	9245720	Anything else on your mind tonight, X-Link, before I let you go?
9245720	9246720	No, that was pretty much about it.
9246720	9249040	I just thought it was kind of interesting when I was hearing about all that, you know.
9249040	9252120	You know, there's more games than just the Imagination series and...
9252120	9255420	You know, with all these things we're seeing, you know, with... between the Ubisoft news
9255420	9258420	and then we're talking about the whole... what was it?
9258420	9262760	SOCOM or whatever that game is on PSP that's gonna have the multiplayer's gonna charge
9262760	9265140	if you didn't buy it new.
9265140	9267080	You're gonna see all these inventive things.
9267080	9269600	It's just... it's not even the beginning of the end.
9269600	9270600	Not even.
9270600	9274800	And the interesting thing about that would be that also is I would love to see the responses
9274800	9277220	from people from eBay that don't know about it.
9277220	9281080	They buy the game you use for their son or something and then they figure out, you know,
9281080	9284040	the son wants to play multiplayer and figure out they have to charge another $20 for it
9284040	9285040	to get the multiplayer.
9285040	9286040	Yeah.
9286040	9287040	That's gonna be interesting to see the results on that.
9287040	9288040	So...
9288040	9292080	That's gonna be interesting as in about like a 20 car pile up on the side of the road.
9292080	9293080	Alright, X-Link.
9293080	9294080	Gotta let you go, buddy.
9294080	9295080	Have a good one.
9295080	9296080	No problem.
9296080	9297080	You too.
9297080	9298080	Bye.
9298080	9299080	We just have call after call tonight.
9299080	9300080	Let's go to another call.
9300080	9301080	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9301080	9302080	Who's this?
9302080	9303080	Hey, folks.
9303080	9304080	It's SSJ100 Matt.
9304080	9305080	Hi, SSJ100 Matt.
9305080	9307960	What's on your mind tonight?
9307960	9308960	Not much.
9308960	9310280	Definitely not Halo Reach.
9310280	9315160	But by the way, Zaku... keyboard Zaku cats are better.
9315160	9317040	Oh, I see.
9317040	9319880	When it talks about keyboard cat and dog cat, Zaku cat wins.
9319880	9320880	That's fair.
9320880	9321880	Did you say dog cat?
9321880	9322880	Did I say dog cat?
9322880	9323880	I probably did.
9323880	9324880	You said dog cat?
9324880	9325880	I probably did say dog cat.
9325880	9330280	Well, you know, SSJ100 Matt now is gonna make me think of the whole shark and octopus videos
9330280	9335760	with all the YouTubes he was linking tonight, which were A-plus videos, by the way.
9335760	9340440	When you can get videos to get a laugh on a radio show, you've done a good job.
9340440	9341440	Yeah.
9341440	9342440	So...
9342440	9346440	Actually, the one thing I did want to talk about is, that will actually get us to debate.
9346440	9351240	You know, I'm talking about the... the USL madness going on in the forums.
9351240	9352240	Uh-huh, yes.
9352240	9355960	We played a little promo from Bresloh a little earlier.
9355960	9357640	What do you think about what's going on there?
9357640	9358640	Well, I'm just...
9358640	9363800	I'm just kind of amazed at just the amount of, like, hate that's going on in there.
9363800	9369640	Like, right now, Pokemon is beating Final Fantasy VII nine votes to four.
9369640	9370640	Mm-hmm.
9370640	9376240	Now, my question is, are a lot of people just voting against Final Fantasy VII because they
9376240	9380800	just hate the fact that it's overhyped or...
9380800	9381800	I don't know.
9381800	9387480	I think there's, like, a large generation of, like, modern fans that really just do
9387480	9389520	not like Final Fantasy VII.
9389520	9390880	I think it's a little bit of both.
9390880	9394720	I think you have some genuine Pokemon fans, but I think some of that is anti-Final Fantasy
9394720	9395720	VII votes, too.
9395720	9399360	I think, like, any great political race, there's something like that going on there.
9399360	9403960	I wish there was more of a sampling of our audience voting in those polls, but what can
9403960	9404960	you do?
9404960	9405960	Yeah.
9405960	9410000	I mean, obviously, you know, we got Symphony of the Night losing to Legend of Zelda, which,
9410000	9412320	you know, that's a good matchup, so...
9412320	9415040	Yeah, you know, I can't get mad about that.
9415040	9417160	To be honest, I can't get mad about the Pokemon one, too.
9417160	9419080	I realize Pokemon has its rabid fanbase.
9419080	9422560	I mean, the anime is still going, and it's been going for, what, like, at least, like,
9422560	9423560	ten years now?
9423560	9426040	I mean, the anime is just not losing steam, and I get it.
9426040	9427040	You know, I don't...
9427040	9430200	Like, if it was losing to a game like, I don't know, Blades of Steel...
9430200	9433840	Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on there.
9433840	9434840	Hold on there.
9434840	9435840	Listen here.
9435840	9436840	Okay.
9436840	9437840	I just wanted to start something.
9437840	9438840	Yeah.
9438840	9443600	But, um, no, I mean, my point is, you know, if you genuinely like Pokemon and think it's
9443600	9446840	a better game, then I'm cool with that, but, you know, if you just, like, if you're boning
9446840	9452840	against a game that, you know, just because it's overhyped or everyone likes it, you know,
9452840	9454520	like you said, haters to the left.
9454520	9455520	Yes, exactly.
9455520	9456520	Haters gonna hate.
9456520	9459800	You know, I'm okay with Final Fantasy VII taking a step back.
9459800	9460800	I mean, it's what?
9460800	9463840	We're down to, what, 32 games, so if it doesn't make the top 16, oh, well, it probably wouldn't
9463840	9465160	be in my top 16, either.
9465160	9467720	There's other Final Fantasy games I think were better than VII.
9467720	9471440	I love Final Fantasy VI, I love Final Fantasy IV, I would place both those games, and I
9471440	9476200	think VI is still in it, so, you know, I'm okay that if VII's out this round and one
9476200	9479840	of the other Final Fantasy games continues, but what's weird about the whole setup of
9479840	9484400	the way, and it's just, I guess, the way the cards fell, and I know Jon has this very specific
9484400	9490520	way of seeding everything in the match, but it's really weird how, like, three Mario games
9490520	9496720	and, like, three Zelda games are likely to take up the top 32.
9496720	9497720	It's-
9497720	9501240	Then again, you know, maybe Zelda and Mario shouldn't be so good.
9501240	9505220	I know, I know they're good games, I get it, but it's just weird, and I think maybe I'm
9505220	9510080	saying that because some of the games got grouped as series and some didn't, but I'm
9510080	9513680	sure it had a lot to do with how people's lists were, like, I know, like, if you even
9513680	9517060	look at my list, I probably did have two different Zelda games on it and two different Mario
9517060	9518060	games on it.
9518060	9521200	So, they are really good series, but it's just interesting that we're down to, like,
9521200	9524920	you know, we're gonna be down to 16 and, like, half of that is gonna be Zelda and Mario.
9524920	9528460	Hey, you know, listen, I put Blades of Steel as number one.
9528460	9529460	I know you do.
9529460	9533600	Kinda jokingly, but, you know, I, if you saw, you know, I wrote a ridiculous manifesto,
9533600	9534600	just jokingly, but, you know.
9534600	9536680	No, I know, and Blades of Steel was a great game.
9536680	9537680	You know what?
9537680	9538680	I don't play a lot of sports games.
9538680	9541320	I really don't, but I owned Blades of Steel on the NES.
9541320	9542320	That's how good it was.
9542320	9543320	It was a great game.
9543320	9544320	Exactly.
9544320	9545320	And it had Groddies.
9545320	9546320	Only sports games I've ever known.
9546320	9547320	Groddies minigame.
9547320	9548320	So, we're gonna wrap things up.
9548320	9549320	But thanks so much for your call.
9549320	9550320	Yup.
9550320	9551320	Take it easy.
9551320	9552320	Have a good one.
9552320	9553320	All right.
9553320	9554320	Apologies to those that didn't get through tonight.
9554320	9555320	We took, like, four calls tonight.
9555320	9559680	Usually, when I take three, so, uh, send us an email if you didn't get through or a tweet.
9559680	9563460	We always appreciate those and, uh, we'll talk to you guys, hopefully, next time on
9563460	9566520	Orange Lounge Radio, but many, many different ways to interact with the show.
9566520	9569960	Chat room, Twitter, all that good stuff.
9569960	9573840	I'm glad, I think all the calls we got tonight were people that weren't on last week, so
9573840	9576720	it's good to kind of, or maybe Zaku was, I don't know, but it's good to kind of spread
9576720	9577720	the love a little bit.
9577720	9578720	So.
9578720	9579720	All right.
9579720	9582080	Um, we're gonna go around and, uh, kind of start to wrap up the show, but first we gotta
9582080	9584320	make sure all of our last minute stories are cleared out.
9584320	9586800	Uh, anything else you guys want to bring up tonight, Loki?
9586800	9587800	Dark Sakura?
9587800	9589800	I like chocolate.
9589800	9591800	That's not a news breaking story.
9591800	9599000	There's a few things, uh, from, um, AOU 2010, uh, the Arcade Expo that's in, uh, Japan.
9599000	9602240	They're showing off some of the new things including Sega is bringing, uh, Project Diva
9602240	9603240	to the arcades.
9603240	9604240	Yay!
9604240	9612920	Um, rhythm music game kind of looks a little bit like a cross between, um, I don't know,
9612920	9620560	something like maybe like a per-appetite game with, um, oh wow, that Namco singing game.
9620560	9621560	I don't know.
9621560	9626320	Basically, it's just, you know, like a music rhythm game with, uh, chicks singing stuff.
9626320	9627800	Um, it looks neat.
9627800	9631860	It's got these, um, not really popping music buttons, but it's basically got four buttons
9631860	9636620	that kind of match the, uh, PlayStation face buttons.
9636620	9638080	So that's kind of neat.
9638080	9641440	And that'll become an arcades imagined pretty soon.
9641440	9646280	Uh, another one that they showed off that was actually really huge, um, was Metal Gear
9646280	9647280	Arcade.
9647280	9650040	With, talk about one hell of a complex cabinet.
9650040	9651760	Oh yeah, I've heard about this.
9651760	9659700	It's got, like, these 3D glasses, head tracking, um, built into those, like, it's like a goggle
9659700	9660700	type thing.
9660700	9667920	Um, you have a gun that you use and just talk about, well, that's just begging to get broken.
9667920	9669720	Yeah, talk about details.
9669720	9671720	So that's kind of cool.
9671720	9674760	Um, I don't know when that's going to be coming out.
9674760	9680000	Uh, then we were talking, there's, uh, apparently there was some concern because of the rumors
9680000	9683800	that Final Fantasy XIV is coming out this year, that Final Fantasy XI will be going
9683800	9686520	by the wayside, um, with the release of that.
9686520	9687880	Is that for real?
9687880	9691980	Because I, I did remember before I had no internet after the move, I remember reading
9691980	9695360	that story and I was like, there's no official word from Square Enix, this seems like a rumor
9695360	9696360	run wild.
9696360	9699400	It just, uh, well, that's the thing, it's, it's not, it's not going to be going by the
9699400	9700400	wayside.
9700400	9701400	Oh, thank God.
9701400	9705680	Uh, Wada, uh, tweeted, uh, there seems to be a rumor that Final Fantasy XI is ending,
9705680	9709200	but if that was done, we're, uh, we'd be in trouble.
9709200	9710200	Um.
9710200	9712920	Well, if it's on Twitter, then you know it's true.
9712920	9716780	If it's coming from, you know, uh, Yoji Wada.
9716780	9721340	In this case, if it's coming from a verified dude's account, I think there's really no
9721340	9722340	dispute in that, I guess.
9722340	9723340	Yoji Wada.
9723340	9728260	Um, so I guess, no, they can't shut down 11 right now just to make room for 14 EverQuest
9728260	9732640	one and two ran at the same time and you know, all these other ones that have sequels, city
9732640	9734900	heroes and villains are running at the same time.
9734900	9738260	You know, one's not going to close because the other is out.
9738260	9743680	Might there be server consolidations because there's going to be a, yeah, that could happen
9743680	9744680	and probably will happen.
9744680	9748880	I bet 11 has a server consolidation by the end of the year, but it's not going to close.
9748880	9749880	Not going to close.
9749880	9755400	Um, and then the last thing, um, you remember, uh, that we mentioned that Perfect Dark would
9755400	9757880	be coming to Xbox Live Arcade during March.
9757880	9765540	Well with that will be the GoldenEye 007 maps from, um, the game on Nintendo 64.
9765540	9769000	Those will be also coming to Perfect Dark as well as possibly the weapons.
9769000	9774240	Sneaky, sneaky, sneaky way to get GoldenEye content on the Xbox without having to do all
9774240	9775240	the licenses.
9775240	9776240	There you go.
9776240	9777240	I like the way they think.
9777240	9778240	Next best thing.
9778240	9779240	Good job.
9779240	9780240	That's it.
9780240	9781240	All right.
9781240	9784920	Well, if that does it for a last minute stories, then it's the part of the show.
9784920	9788060	We're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
9788060	9789760	So Alan, we'll start with you.
9789760	9791360	Thank you so much for coming and being on the show tonight.
9791360	9795800	I know you didn't get to say a whole lot, but I hope you had fun sitting in here and
9795800	9796800	sitting in.
9796800	9797800	Thanks for having me.
9797800	9798800	No problem.
9798800	9801360	Come again sometime and, and, and don't be afraid to speak your mind.
9801360	9803880	It's where every gamer has a voice, Alan, even yours.
9803880	9805760	So do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?
9805760	9807840	My cat's breath smells like cat food.
9807840	9808840	Okay.
9808840	9809840	Yeah.
9809840	9810840	Uh, Loki, your final thought tonight?
9810840	9815640	Uh, my final thought is I get to take off work tomorrow cause I am sick.
9815640	9820920	My final thought is looking at the Dragon Quest slime on Dan's desk kind of makes me
9820920	9822600	want to play Dragon Quest eight.
9822600	9824960	I don't know why, but it was kind of cool.
9824960	9826640	Dark Sakura, your final thought.
9826640	9833440	I'm totally addicted to this, uh, Sailor Senshi doll maker.
9833440	9837360	You are the reason Ubisoft has a market for those designer dress games.
9837360	9838360	No, I'm kidding.
9838360	9840160	Uh, probably you're right.
9840160	9842760	Actually, I'm kind of jealous watching you play.
9842760	9847480	No, thanks a lot of course for tuning into our show and supporting and downloading and
9847480	9848960	listening to independent radio.
9848960	9849960	We really appreciate it.
9849960	9851200	We do this show for free.
9851200	9854920	All we ask if you enjoyed what you heard, tell a friend about the show, help spread
9854920	9856360	the word about orange lounge radio.
9856360	9857740	We really appreciate it.
9857740	9862000	And you know what, you know what else helps leaving reviews on iTunes or links.
9862000	9866600	Some of you plug us in like forum signatures and stuff, even if it's like a little banner
9866600	9868040	that's like, I listen to LR.
9868040	9871920	We think that kind of stuff is really cool and really makes the, this whole thing worth
9871920	9872920	it.
9872920	9876280	So, uh, uh, even when it's an off night like tonight, but you know what, the whole chat
9876280	9877440	room seems to be into it.
9877440	9878440	So Hey, good times.
9878440	9879880	Uh, thank you guys.
9879880	9882960	We really appreciate the support and we'll be back to do it all again next week.
9882960	9884600	What do you guys think?
9884600	9885600	Why not?
9885600	9886600	Why not?
9886600	9890600	So for myself, Alan, Loki, Jamie and Shermy, good night.
