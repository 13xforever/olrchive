14076	24376	Night, February 21st, 2010 Nintendo hits Australian piracy again EA is going to shut down more servers And a recent HD fighting game is being ported to the iPhone
31266	39009	Hello, my friends on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the video game podcast where every gamer has a voice.
39489	43351	We are live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
43671	49653	Thanks to the folks at All Games Radio for letting us steal their bandwidth every week right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, live on Sunday nights.
49713	50614	My name is Rob Roberts.
50654	52134	I'll be joining you over the next few hours.
52214	55816	With me, as always, say hello to my one and only co-host, Dark Sakura.
55876	56436	One and only.
57355	59096	Well, you know, one and only sidekick.
59136	61738	I don't know, because I always introduce Loki as Tech Master Loki.
61778	63759	He's still a co-host, but that's just the way it is.
63779	64660	You made him spit out his chicken.
64700	65180	I'm sorry.
65720	66521	Loki knows I love him.
67281	68782	Not in a, you know, no homo.
70704	72305	Isn't that what the rappers say now?
72625	78689	I think I was seeing something the other day where, I don't know, some rappers were talking about, you know, yeah, yeah, you look really good in that outfit, no homo.
79269	82411	Although I am a homo, if you haven't already heard, so whatever.
83312	85093	This show's off to a very strange start already tonight.
85113	86434	It's not just the bandwidth issues, is it?
87514	89275	Yeah, so anyway, how you doing, DarkSakura?
89635	90156	I'm doing.
90336	90656	All right.
91096	94538	And, of course, the one and only Techmaster Loki is here as well.
94758	95058	Hello.
95238	95879	How you doing, Loki?
96119	96439	Good.
96859	97199	All right.
98580	104583	So we're going to be talking video games, of course, over the next few hours with you guys at our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
104603	106044	And I want to apologize in advance.
106484	109606	Live radio tonight, I don't know what's going on.
109626	112747	We're having some bandwidth issues on all games, and I think it's kind of why we're off.
113087	114168	It's not all games' fault, though.
114208	116169	They're perfect, because Bobby had a flawless show last night.
116229	117169	DarkSakura, Luke, Carameldansen
144597	162100	Alright, so we also have a special guest here in the studio tonight And it's not often we get guests at Studio DarkSakura, besides Shermie of course But sometimes you have Dan, and I know Tiara's been here before as well But tonight we have another special guest, say hello everybody to Salacious Pop Hello, how are you?
162440	163220	I'm good, how are you?
163340	172322	Good, now it's funny that I was talking about Nohomo earlier Because Salacious Pop happens to be my boyfriend That's right, I brought my boyfriend to the show tonight, so how are you?
172982	173363	I'm great.
173523	173783	Yes.
174123	178527	So tell the listeners a little bit about yourself and video games like what you're into.
179588	182471	Like what kind of video games do you play without like telling us about your gaming week?
182491	185534	What would you say would be like your favorite video game and the types of stuff you're into?
187696	190238	Music and rhythm games, RPGs and adventure games.
191290	192891	What would you say is your favorite video game ever?
194874	195955	Valkyrie Profile.
196295	196475	Why?
197056	201100	The art direction, the story, the multiple endings, and the music.
202301	204924	How did you get into video games?
204964	210250	Did you get into video games when you were older, or was it something you've had a controller in your hands since you were born, or what?
210510	214914	I think I got an Atari 2600 when I was about 6 or 7 years old.
215294	221760	And from there I graduated up to the NES and Super NES and played all these Sierra online games and that was it.
222401	222841	Very cool.
223662	225764	And of course the chat room is chiming in here.
225824	228206	Leachum6 in chat says, does that mean plus homo?
228687	229047	I guess.
229167	229487	I don't know.
229888	230248	Whatever.
230648	232230	We're just, you know what?
233771	234712	We like video games.
234732	235873	That's the important thing here.
235893	235933	So...
237156	239098	Yeah, we're going to talk about video games over the next few hours.
239198	242881	The latest that's going on in video games and news and everything.
243161	243862	I don't know what it is.
243942	245283	Tonight is just an off night.
245363	250668	I don't know if it's like the bandwidth or what, but I just feel kind of off and it has nothing to do with Alan being here.
250708	252269	Maybe I'm cracking under the pressure.
252289	252610	I don't know.
252950	254031	Is it different being here?
254051	255872	Because you've listened to the show before, obviously, right?
255912	256933	You've commented in chat.
256993	259075	Is it different being here in studio than it is listening?
259716	260176	Absolutely.
260536	261117	How is it different?
262062	263284	Dan's in the other room, I'm nervous.
274392	275193	All right, well, don't be nervous.
275413	276174	And even Loki.
276234	277715	Loki seems a little off tonight, too.
277775	278736	What's going on, Loki?
278756	280377	Because I asked Loki a question earlier.
280417	281198	He has malaria.
281278	282639	He got a little bitchy with me.
282739	285482	Like, it's not... Loki's not usually the bitchy one.
285622	287063	DarkSakura, she's the bitchy one.
287103	288444	Loki... I didn't get bitchy.
288524	289345	I was joking.
289385	290466	You were a little bitchy.
290606	291787	I was joking.
291887	293769	Oh, okay.
294029	296071	Yeah, that's what I tell Dan once a month.
296931	299514	She's like, well, someone didn't give me the stories that I put in there.
299534	300535	I'm like, well, that's too bad.
302195	328124	but here's the thing here's the thing the listeners have to know is that Loki although I know he kind of gets branded as the angry one on the show like you know because he does his little rants when it's appropriate and he's like the angry guy on the show like he's actually like if you meet him in real life he's one of like the nicest people you'll ever meet seriously like I really mean that like Loki goes out of his way to help people you know he's that guy you can call when your computer's broken or you know that tech guy everybody knows that you can call right?
328204	328964	I'm the angry one
329184	330928	Yeah, and Jamie's usually the angry one.
331288	335697	But tonight is weird because Loki was kind of like, you know...
336437	337938	Well, I don't know.
338018	338478	Too bad.
340220	342761	And then Jamie's like, I'm going to knit the listeners a sweater.
344282	344723	Well, no.
344843	349846	It was just like she wanted to put stories in and I forgot to put them on there.
349886	351887	And I'm like, well, I can't do anything about it now.
352168	352848	It's no big deal.
352888	353449	I don't think anyone cares.
353469	354349	I was trying to be funny.
354669	356471	I wasn't like, damn you, woman.
356551	357872	Why are you complaining?
358992	359933	It's never like that.
359953	362054	How can I be mad?
362194	362775	I have chicken.
363618	364678	No, how can anybody be mad?
364698	365018	I don't know.
365038	366599	And Rob brought churro chips.
367259	367699	That's right.
367719	369340	These delicious... I'm going to endorse these.
369360	371341	They don't pay me, but these chips are delicious.
371381	372941	I think I would like another couple of them, please.
372961	376382	They're Stacy's Cinnamon Sugar Pita Chips, and they're delicious.
376562	378043	And I bought them at Walgreens.
378063	378623	No, wait, wait, wait.
378863	379623	Get back in here.
379783	381864	Wait, is... A Dan approaches?
381884	382824	Get your butt back in here.
382864	383985	Throw the pester ball at Dan.
384005	384865	See if he can catch his attention.
384885	385525	Pester, pester.
385905	387926	Bother, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother.
388220	388280	Dan!
388300	389400	Dan was just trying to say hi to Alan
416509	418657	If it's your 50th time listening, I'm sorry.
419962	421649	Alright, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
422476	425917	It was a lot of Star Trek Online because I have a new graphics card.
426437	429518	Or really, I have someone else's old graphics card, but it's new to me.
430098	432238	In fact, the box of it is sitting right behind you.
433419	434079	Indeed.
435179	445482	Oh, it's the GeForce 9800 GTX Plus Black Edition with bells and whistles and crack, you know, falling out of it.
447242	448162	Have you overclocked it yet?
448682	448842	No.
449383	449723	You should.
450763	451083	We'll see.
452045	454747	because it's easy and it's extra juice.
455348	455708	We'll see.
456169	456429	Okay.
457210	458951	Why don't you overclock the card, woman?
459832	460873	Don't you know what you're doing?
462174	464716	Well... I couldn't resist.
464837	467219	It went in on Wednesday.
468640	470362	Since then, I've had a friend in the hospital.
470382	471863	I'm sorry.
471883	472684	I've had homework.
473304	474125	I've had a meeting.
474145	474605	Is your friend okay?
474766	475406	Is this someone I know?
475947	476427	Are they okay?
476467	478129	I don't think... No, you've met him.
478389	478469	Um...
480314	485618	One of my friends from Temple, he went in with something with his heart.
487459	490821	I'll tell you more offline.
491142	503831	So I went to see him at the hospital, and I've been trying to play Star Trek Online today, but my internet's been kind of... So every time I would pick a system to go to, it would...
505032	513574	Okay, you know on Ragnarok Online, when you would have a hiccup, and your character would just suddenly back up like a bajillion miles back from wherever you were before?
514074	518076	I understand, but I'll bet you maybe 1% of the listenership understands.
518416	530479	Well, it'd be like, my ship would hiccup, it would backtrack, so you'd actually see the trails going backwards ahead of the ship, and it would change direction, and I'm like, what the hell?
531212	535596	So basically your computer was telling you, I can't keep it moving, I don't have the power!
537177	543283	It wasn't even letting, giving me any option to enter the system when I was manually controlling it to go there.
543964	548868	I was like, well crap, I can't, you know, level, but I started my Klingon the other night and that was pretty cool.
550239	550900	I have Klingon now.
551540	552701	So the system was down.
553321	554262	The system is down.
554282	555463	The system is down.
555603	556563	Okay.
556824	560366	I was also playing little clone games on my Linux box.
561087	564149	I was playing, I think it was called Penguin Freeze or something.
564529	566170	And it's best to move with penguins.
567011	567931	And they had Kinect 4.
568992	570293	And I was playing Minesweeper.
570773	575777	And the little, you know... A socially awkward penguin in the game?
576317	576738	I guess.
576758	576998	Yeah.
578219	591421	and then um I was playing Puzzle Bobble in Flash which is pretty fun and um that's about it yeah alright and I slept
592628	594510	Techmaster Loki, how was your gaming week?
594550	601778	Actually, before I get to that, I should say some of the people in chat are commenting on the exchange earlier about the switching personalities night.
602319	604701	SJ100Matt, go USA in chat.
604961	606123	That's right, it's Olympics time.
606904	610367	SJ100Matt says, Loki missed posting stories, but at least he has chicken.
611509	612510	Loki Jenkins.
615699	619063	I just wanted honey barbecue chicken every now and then to get the craving for.
619083	619924	There's nothing wrong with chicken.
620725	623869	You know, I kind of have a cold right now, so it was the only thing that sounded good.
625090	627573	Chicken and vitamin C. Orange chicken.
628074	628314	Yeah.
628895	629736	Orange chicken, yeah.
629756	630517	There you go.
632783	635664	Um, let's see, this week, didn't play a whole lot of stuff.
635964	640505	I did put in a good five hours worth of Borderlands, so yesterday, so that was fun.
641285	648267	Um, started doing, uh, Mad Moxie's Underdome Riot, and it's very tedious.
648487	657449	Although, I did play one round with a friend, um, earlier in the week during lunch, and it was actually pretty fun co-op, but single player, man, it's pretty boring.
658149	658589	But, um...
659869	665593	It was cool, so I played that a little bit, and I'm just kind of working through Borderlands still.
665633	669476	It's still very fun, and I can't wait for the next expansion to come out.
669496	670137	That'll be pretty cool.
670397	672578	Although, what a weird level cap, though.
672658	675420	They capped it at 61 in the new expansion.
676301	676561	Huh.
677242	678823	It's like, okay...
680376	682138	Well, maybe there's going to be four more expansions.
682158	683479	So it'll be 62 and then 63.
683579	688604	It's still dumb, but 61, okay, that's what you want to stop at.
688684	690445	Fine with me.
691086	693528	And then, of course, more Grand Theft Auto.
694008	700134	In fact, actually, I want to say that I'm in the top 200 now for cumulative...
707280	718726	I'm not really sure about that, but I know for a fact, though, I'm in like the mid-70s now for true skill rankings, so I'm in the top 75 players in the world.
719206	719967	So that's pretty awesome.
720867	724429	And if one of our listeners wants to serve you a slice of humble pie, how can they do that?
725151	725851	Find me online.
726091	727592	We play just ranked games now.
727672	742619	So if you happen to be playing a ranked game around 10, 10.30-ish, 3, 3.30, and then sometime between noon and 1, depending if we're playing during lunch, you should be able to find us because there's no one on there.
743700	744580	So it's pretty easy.
745540	749022	We have four systems, and we're able to get into ranked games together easy.
749762	749982	So...
751363	752004	Thanks for watching!
766863	767283	I don't know.
767964	768545	QQ more.
770106	770727	They make fun of me.
770747	771367	They're like, what?
772028	777072	Like, they'll get ahead or something and they'll be just like, oh, you're just sucking it up today, blah, blah, blah.
777092	779695	I'm like, alright, now I gotta kill you.
781136	782157	See how they go and do that.
782617	789063	And now you're just gonna learn the lesson that's involved with, you know, criticizing my plane.
789884	790244	And that is...
791445	791705	Death.
792065	793066	Lots and lots of death.
794507	795948	In very humiliating ways.
797849	798109	So yeah.
799390	799670	Alright.
800910	802731	My gaming week, not a whole lot to report on.
802751	803892	I moved this week though.
803912	804953	I have a really good excuse.
805033	808315	I have a new place that I'm living at and I'm still without internet.
808335	810776	So not even a lot of WoW this weekend.
810876	811456	It's kind of sad.
812217	815218	But I did play a little bit of WoW of course earlier in the week.
815238	815839	I mean, come on.
815919	816779	It's me we're talking about.
817600	819441	I was playing that right up until they unplugged the internet.
820021	840375	And then after that, probably my other big gaming thing was that I actually went to Roseville Golf Land this week The great place where video games go to die Although I have to say, the games I was interested in playing were all working fine And I did play lots and lots of Beatmania Distorted And I was playing the old school songs in Distorted But I know Alan tried playing King of Fighters What was wrong?
840516	843237	You were playing King of Fighters 98 or something?
843258	843958	What were you playing there?
844278	845339	Yeah, it was King of Fighters 2003 Okay
847120	856626	and the first player side had a button missing and the second player side couldn't move left or forward when you're second player so that was a great time.
858988	860649	That's so easy to fix too though.
860789	863170	Imagine trying to play a fighting game without moving forward.
863190	864011	You know what this means?
864611	865492	Photo time again.
866292	869694	But I gotta say, the 2DX machine worked fine.
869955	872556	And all the music games actually seemed to be in really good shape.
872817	875418	You were playing DJ Max Technica.
875438	876359	Yeah, that was working fine, right?
876379	878801	Let me give you an example of how long it's been since I've been there.
879301	883244	They didn't have the 2DX machine set up the last time I was there.
885208	885729	You know what?
885809	887630	Not a lot's changed, I gotta be honest.
888051	892535	It's, you know, a lot of Ticket Redemption machines still, and this is really true of any arcade I could probably mention.
892595	894336	It's mostly Ticket Redemption machines.
894356	895017	It's a safe bet.
895457	895758	Yeah.
895858	902103	I did play a little bit, Alan and I sparred on Mario Kart, and, you know, it's nothing like Mario Kart, the home version.
903084	904866	You know, I've been wanting to play the second one.
905366	933961	because they have a second GPRK but yeah the GPRK ones are kind of boring actually but hey port them in the home systems make them playable online oh wait asking too much alright so that was pretty much my gaming week not a lot of exciting stuff because you know without me moving right now hopefully I'll have more next week I know I will in two weeks when Final Fantasy XIII is out so just wait Alan how was your it's only two weeks away I know it's exciting it is exciting it's so exciting alright Alan how was your gaming week what did you play
934481	939144	I played a lot of WoW because for some reason someone got me into that.
939184	939805	I don't know who.
940945	942747	So lots of WoW.
942887	945248	Logged into my City of Heroes characters.
945669	946509	I still play that.
947090	951192	The next expansion, Going Rogue, is actually due out in July.
952913	956696	So I just logged in to get re-familiarized myself with my characters.
958657	963080	Played some Gyromancer, the DLC, the extra hard maps.
963220	963821	Now that it works.
964361	965182	Yes, now that it works.
966923	969725	And Valkyrie Profile DS is really what I'm playing right now.
970746	971126	Very cool.
972707	975870	City of Heroes real quick, because it's not a game we've talked a lot about on the show.
975910	977951	I think we've all kind of like dabbled in it a little bit.
977971	980673	I've got the Architect Edition in my closet.
980854	984657	I know you kind of played it like a little bit, but not like extensively, right?
985177	986858	What does City of Heroes have?
986878	989220	Because you're obviously still playing it while you're juggling WoW.
989520	993043	What does City of Heroes have for you in an MMO that WoW is lacking?
994565	1004235	The ability to come up with a very strong character concept and the costume designer is so powerful that you can pretty much have a completely unique character.
1004255	1005116	Oh, I love that.
1005296	1011602	I downloaded that little Korean client that you could just play with all day and not have to even have an account.
1011942	1012583	That was so much fun.
1013744	1034353	and I did notice that when you were showing me your thing like how you could like go in a phone booth and you'd have like the different costumes you could save like five different costume presets it didn't seem to affect your abilities at all whatsoever at least that I noticed I don't know maybe it did and then like you had a little bio written on your character and you'd actually kind of written a whole little thing and I was thinking this is like an RP type of player's
1034913	1040617	City of Heroes has an amazing RP community, and I think it's almost a six-year-old game.
1041077	1049323	And for them to be releasing a major expansion six years after the fact, there has to be the money there and the subscriptions, and it's mostly the RPers that are sticking around.
1050584	1052925	And WoW's probably been around about five, six years.
1052985	1055847	It just had its fifth anniversary, so it's been around about as long.
1056568	1062652	Yeah, City of Heroes was huge for the first six or seven months, and then when WoW came out, there was sort of a big vacuum.
1065434	1066955	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1082552	1102854	but there's definitely you know there's always going to be those diehards that just love the game and I think especially when you bring that RP component into it you know I don't know I mean Final Fantasy XI had somewhat you could do I mean you could do the RP with any game but I could see where City of Heroes really lets you embrace that you know Final Fantasy XI if you think WoW is limited with how your character can look Final Fantasy XI is really limiting too so
1103854	1111498	Well, I have to say that, you know, the moment I moved on to Star Trek Online, I forgot about World of Warcraft.
1111758	1112318	Really, I did.
1112338	1115840	Okay, then let me ask you the same question I asked Alan.
1115900	1118621	What is it about Star Trek Online that had it for you that WoW didn't?
1118781	1121823	Or is it just, I know you love Star Trek, is it just the fandom, period?
1121983	1127930	It's really not just the fandom, it's the fact that I really can play by myself.
1128051	1132196	It's annoying as fuck to party with people.
1132456	1133417	Really, it's annoying.
1133537	1134479	It pisses me off.
1134579	1135240	I hate doing it.
1136745	1141248	Even when it's one of my friends, after an hour of following behind somebody, I'm like, okay, I'm tired of this.
1141268	1142068	This is monotonous.
1142729	1153615	Whereas in Star Trek Online, it's like when you are doing your instances, you go into an area and you may have three people already there, complete strangers, and you can run through your series of instances together.
1153935	1155176	When you're done with it, that's it.
1155956	1157277	You don't have to really hang out with them.
1157517	1159018	You don't have to follow them around.
1159058	1160179	You can do your own thing.
1160919	1170605	Like, I had one person go into one instance, and I went to a completely different one, and we all got, you know, the points for it, because we, it was still, we were working together.
1171526	1181532	And that's what I like, is it's sort of, it's teamwork, but you can choose if you want to do a fleet mission or, and it's, and it feels like an episode.
1181813	1185435	It's got enough random in it that it really keeps my interest in it.
1185945	1186245	I hate PvP.
1206808	1215132	You know, but I gotta admit, from a WoW standpoint, you know, I realize not everybody's into it, which is cool, but for me, why I like WoW is that it is such a robust game.
1215492	1225756	You know, I can just log in, it's like, oh, I'm gonna just go slip right into a dungeon, or, you know, nobody else is online, maybe I'll go PvP by myself, or, hey, Alan's online, we're gonna go quest together, and it's like we're hanging out, but we're not, because we're nerds.
1226176	1230098	I totally don't mind doing PvP if I get to smash some Klingons in the face.
1231299	1235661	I just can't wait until we get the Romulan and Cardassian missions.
1235741	1237081	Is that like a future expansion?
1237101	1238782	Yeah, I think that's going to be a future thing.
1239562	1247666	I will play some more Star Trek online, but see, there's this big thing kind of hovering in the distance, and that is Final Fantasy XIV.
1249247	1251631	And I just know, like, I have to play it.
1252012	1252512	I have to.
1252873	1254375	I sucked three years.
1254436	1257500	I mean, if you guys think I talk about WoW a lot, you should have been on the show.
1259334	1260475	3, 4 years ago.
1260595	1263656	Like, do you remember when we used to talk about the fairy server?
1263756	1265137	I mean, that's old school, okay?
1265197	1266037	I used to play with you.
1266157	1266857	I know, we used to talk.
1267037	1270259	I mean, I used to just talk about Final Fantasy XI all the freaking time on this show.
1270339	1274140	So, I mean, I have to try XIV just because I sunk so much time into XI.
1274200	1276861	Well, you know, I gave XI a really good try.
1276901	1280483	I mean, you were here watching me play, doing the freaking macros on my controller.
1280583	1283224	But if you hate grouping with people, XI stinks.
1283404	1283884	It does.
1283964	1285685	I mean, XI is about forced...
1286417	1287259	and me.
1287579	1293047	To be fair, they fixed a lot of that years later after I left with the level sync and everything.
1295391	1299697	My big problem with that one is just that maybe it was because I was playing the White Mage.
1299717	1301320	Maybe it was because I was the party bitch.
1302441	1302781	You know?
1303942	1305243	And I've told this story before.
1306984	1312448	The final straw for that game was me calling everybody over with my little dinky... Okay, I will go back.
1312528	1314629	Actually, playing with Japanese players is not annoying.
1315330	1316250	They know how to party.
1317371	1317951	If you know what I mean.
1318092	1319813	They're the only ones that would respect a bard.
1320873	1322094	That's right.
1322134	1323335	I remember when you tried to play a bard.
1323355	1327998	Dude, I was a pimp-ass bard, but, you know... No one wanted to play the bard.
1328498	1329479	I rocked the bard.
1329599	1330320	Audience, if you would...
1333521	1334842	See, here's your proof.
1335442	1336462	Angry Loki.
1336542	1340543	When you talk about, you know, some of the hacking and the stuff, he gets angry Loki.
1341223	1342463	I rocked the bard.
1342483	1346344	What angry man says that?
1346504	1350925	Remember, you can also swap out the music and stuff in there because there was that little trick you could do.
1351425	1355246	And so I would have, like, smack my bitch up to, like, the battle music.
1355486	1356426	It was awesome.
1357286	1361107	I remember when you would mount up on the chocobo and it would play the theme from The NeverEnding Story.
1362739	1362875	Thanks for watching!
1366642	1367082	Oh, yes.
1367603	1368263	Oh, that's fun.
1368843	1371724	Well, what my story was, as I was saying.
1371784	1372104	Sorry.
1372205	1372625	It's okay.
1372725	1373565	No, I think that's funny.
1373665	1374165	It was worth it.
1374185	1375406	Smack my bitch up.
1375846	1383429	Anyway, so my little character, you know, because when you throw out your macros, you can call everyone in your party to come back to you so that you can do an area effect buff.
1384130	1389832	And I was finally like, I did the buff, everything, then this one comes in, hey, I'm in a buff.
1390132	1392013	I'm like, fuck you.
1392353	1392954	Log out.
1393734	1394614	And that was it.
1394714	1395655	I never played again.
1398105	1403174	I totally forgot about Falkor's Ride or whatever it said to the Chocobo thing.
1403515	1404457	It was awesome.
1405018	1406000	It was very epic.
1406952	1411797	This was when Loki and I lived together, and, like, we had our computers, like, kind of, like, right next to each other, like, they're here in the studio.
1412077	1418143	So, you know, I'd be doing my thing in Final Fantasy XI, and then, like, I'm like, okay, because, you know, Loki and I would play together sometimes because we're nerds, right?
1418423	1421486	And I'd say, like, okay, Loki, come meet me in Alteppa Desert and let's party.
1424249	1427251	And, like, Loki's fanfare is, like, coming from the computer.
1429953	1430633	Bring your harp!
1433235	1449288	I did that though with Ragnarok for a little while because it's all mp3s so you could change out the music so I remember going into it was this one place that used to have this big epic music and it was like instead it was a bassoon quartet
1450080	1450821	There was another one.
1450841	1453984	The group party music that I had was the battle music.
1454324	1459188	It wasn't the theme of Zanarkand or whatever, but from Final Fantasy XI.
1459308	1461951	Oh, it was the jacked, angry music.
1461971	1462491	I remember that.
1462852	1463392	Otherworld.
1464573	1466615	It was awesome.
1466735	1471099	I don't remember that from Final Fantasy X. I remember it from your freaking every time.
1471419	1474082	Because I was a healer, so I never really engaged the monster.
1474602	1500697	but like, you know, when you, I think you finally started Black Mage instead of Bard, and you know, we'd be fighting, you know, the killer level 60 rabbit, or whatever and then like, okay engage the rabbit, doo doo doo doo doo, like you just had the most epic bunny killing music I'd ever heard in my life I just hope that's the only thing that they include from Final Fantasy XI in XIV is the ability to change the music you're not supposed to be able to do that, you just like to hack things, yes alright
1502518	1505461	Anyhow, boy, we're not even into the gaming news yet.
1505661	1506021	You know what?
1506302	1508504	If I was going to do that, then my battle music would be bitches.
1510706	1511606	Mindless self-indulgence.
1513388	1514289	I don't know what mine would be.
1514950	1516831	What would be some good battle music for me, Alan?
1516931	1519614	I'm trying to think for Final Fantasy XIV if I could hack the music.
1519634	1520795	What are you guys talking about?
1525728	1543133	Anyhow Actually Shaoran in the chat room I hope I pronounced that right Chat.orangewatchradio.com has a suggestion If Star Trek Online had a customizable music OLR would need to bring in I'm on a boat I would totally do that for the You know how they have the ferries you can take
1546842	1550566	Oh yeah, I remember the first time taking a ferry in Final Fantasy XI.
1550606	1554450	I got on the little ferry because getting around in Final Fantasy XI kind of sucks.
1554530	1556992	It takes like 30 minutes to get from one thing to the other.
1557332	1558173	So you'd get on the boat.
1558213	1559915	I remember the first time I ever took a boat ride.
1559935	1562657	It's like do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
1562697	1564759	Happy little boat music and then all of a sudden it gets really dark.
1565120	1566041	Do-do-do-do-do-do.
1566721	1568281	Oh, we freaking got raided by pirates.
1568801	1570542	The first time I ever rode a boat in the game.
1570842	1574223	But I remember that being an epic moment of Final Fantasy XI.
1574263	1577603	I was like, that was actually really cool that the boats will randomly get raided by pirates.
1579644	1582644	You would have to, as a low-level character, literally run and hide in the basement.
1583024	1583985	I think I had to.
1584005	1586805	Because you came and got me one time.
1586865	1588886	While someone drags a kraken down the stairs.
1591556	1591856	Anyhow.
1592676	1598297	I have to say, though, I still, to this day, remember the look on your face when I was doing my macros on my controller.
1598737	1601958	I was very impressed with the way you were doing the... And then I couldn't.
1601978	1603318	That's what I hated in World of Warcraft.
1603338	1604539	I couldn't use my damn controller.
1604639	1606659	Final Fantasy XI was built for the PS2.
1607519	1610740	And I have to remember, using a controller, that's the way most of the Japanese players do it.
1611020	1612880	And some American ones as well, obviously.
1613200	1615381	But I cannot imagine that game without a computer keyboard.
1615821	1616021	Anyway.
1616921	1617722	I agree with Ranma.
1617762	1619223	When did this become Final Fantasy Radio?
1619283	1619643	I don't know.
1619683	1620303	So let's move on.
1620343	1628008	Let's get into some housekeeping tonight and talk a little bit about what's going on with OLR before we get into the gaming news tonight.
1629750	1632952	I don't have a whole lot of show-specific news besides...
1633732	1647514	Don't forget that you can always join us on our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, and of course we're on Facebook as well, Orange Lounge Radio there, add us as your friend, and we will usually make updates, except tonight, because with all the internet hiccup we had earlier, we didn't get onto many of the social networking, but...
1648149	1656091	Also, we got a voicemail from Breslul, and he wants to update you guys on USL Madness and what is going on there in our forums.
1656511	1661892	So I want to go to the voicemail, and uh-oh, did I delete it?
1661972	1662473	I hope not.
1663333	1666714	Oops, when we did the reboot earlier, I might have deleted his voicemail.
1666954	1668874	Whoopsie, let's see if I can get to it here.
1670074	1671275	And here we go, here's his voicemail.
1671295	1676076	Here's a voicemail from Breslul about what is going on in USL Madness at our forums at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
1678100	1688124	Hello Orange Lounge Radio, it's Brest Law once again reminding you, three hosts, and the listeners to give us some votes here on USL Madness.
1688164	1690305	We have some fantastic matchups in the round of 32.
1691325	1694507	We've got a heated one between Final Fantasy 7 and Pokemon.
1694887	1698908	Mega Man 2 is facing Mega Man 3 in one of the most bizarre matchups of the tournament.
1699429	1703050	Ocarina of Time vs. Tecmo Super Bowl, Earthbound vs. Secret of Mana.
1703210	1705511	I could go on, but there's not enough time in the show.
1705987	1716536	but please visit our forums, get yourself an account and vote today because half of these games go away and then next week is the Sweet 16 where things get incredibly interesting.
1717337	1720079	Once again, log on to our forums and vote.
1720780	1725524	We'll talk to you later and USL will be back on the... This is it.
1726185	1726946	Let me try that again.
1727426	1731630	USL will be back on February 27th.
1731730	1732390	We'll see you then.
1732530	1732931	Till then!
1734096	1742780	That was Bress Lowell from Under Sedation Live, Saturday nights at AllGamesRadio, AllGamesRadio.com, or if you want just the radio feed, it's AllGamesRadio.com.
1743420	1744881	And they'll be back on Saturday.
1744941	1754305	But yeah, Bress Lowell and Travis, they team up with us to do this USL Madness, which is kind of like a take on March Madness, if you don't know what it is, where they try to define the greatest video game of all time.
1755005	1758327	And everybody submits their lists, and then he seeds it like it was basketball games and
1758667	1759527	And Guardian Legend wins.
1760448	1763548	Guardian Legend wasn't even in the top 64 on people's list.
1763568	1764329	It was on my list.
1764369	1767009	I had it in my top 25 games of all time, but I guess that wasn't enough.
1767389	1768970	Because, admittedly, it wasn't number one.
1769030	1769470	Sorry, Jamie.
1770310	1773871	But, yeah, as he said in the voicemail, there's some pretty epic matchups going on right now.
1773891	1775391	Like Mega Man 2 versus Mega Man 3.
1775491	1777392	How do you even decide between those two games?
1777432	1778072	Mega Man 2.
1778412	1779112	Practically the same guy.
1779152	1779453	Mega Man 2.
1779853	1780733	I said 2 as well.
1780793	1782553	What is it that draws you to 2 over 3, though?
1783114	1784294	I like the number 2 better than the 3.
1787603	1816718	Bubble Man Stage Music Metal Blades I think it's just the fact that well for me and the way I rationalized it when I voted on the forums was that Mega Man 2 was kind of set the bar like obviously Mega Man 1 was the original but you know it had all these things like scoring and less bosses and kind of a different interface and everything Mega Man 2 kind of really polished that and really Mega Man 3 is just Mega Man 2 with some new frills in it but Mega Man 2 was so important that those bosses came back in 3
1817880	1823622	Mega Man 2 was one of my big accomplishments because I used to be able to do the dragon level blindfolded.
1823742	1825343	I remember you telling me about that.
1825363	1829365	I used to be able to play that game through in one sitting.
1829445	1830805	It's all about timing with that level.
1831105	1834667	The only other game I've been able to do that with is World 8-1 and Super Mario Bros.
1835407	1836708	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1854145	1864434	Final Fantasy 7 is, it seems like a lot of the vote isn't, I mean, I could be wrong, but there's a lot of vote that is not for Pokemon so much as it is against Final Fantasy 7 because of all the fanboy wank.
1864735	1866476	And I was trying to figure out, like, why that is.
1866556	1873983	Because, like, I don't think Final Fantasy 7 is the best Final Fantasy, but certainly, like, it was the game that got me to buy a PlayStation.
1874503	1876986	It was, you know... I owned that game before I had a PlayStation.
1878026	1878647	How does that work?
1878847	1879507	My roommate had one.
1879808	1879908	Oh.
1881629	1888433	And, yeah, you know, I just remember it just changed the way you kind of perceive Final Fantasy games because it was so different from the sprite-based ones.
1888893	1894537	But I agree the fan wank got a little crazy, but I can't hold that against the game.
1895057	1895497	But I don't know.
1895517	1899159	But then you look at a series like Pokemon, and that's like a cult.
1899720	1902441	That's like, I don't even know.
1902502	1904623	Like, Pokemon sucks people in and doesn't let them go.
1904723	1906244	It's like, I don't get it.
1906664	1907325	Yeah, I don't know.
1907725	1909026	But yeah, whatever.
1909646	1910747	I can't be mad, I guess.
1910827	1911408	That's what happens.
1911608	1914050	Every gamer has a voice, even when that voice is whack.
1914851	1919474	www.orangeloungeradio.com No disrespect to the Pokemon fans.
1921776	1923998	To me, they're kind of all the same game.
1924258	1925779	They are all the same game.
1926560	1926860	Look!
1927301	1932064	Oh my god, we discovered new Pokemon that are no way similar to the other Pokemon.
1932305	1932905	Buy more games.
1933566	1935167	Before you send in the hate mail, though...
1935707	1937329	I was there when the first movie came out in theaters.
1937369	1938489	I went and saw it opening night, okay?
1938509	1940371	I think I went with you, didn't I?
1941192	1942072	No, I went in Chico.
1942373	1944454	No, that's right, because I got the import.
1944654	1947677	You might have went to the second one with me, because I went and saw the second one, too.
1947737	1949118	I saw the third one with you at the theater.
1949538	1949919	Probably.
1950319	1954362	But I had to import a copy of the Japanese one.
1956063	1957445	So, yeah, don't send in the hate mail.
1957845	1958625	Pokemon's fine.
1958665	1958886	I just...
1960673	1961694	Where are they going to go with it?
1961774	1965816	They just make more Pokemon.
1965856	1967457	If they made an MMO, I'd try it.
1967637	1967877	I would.
1967937	1970578	For the record, I still think Digimon's cooler.
1971679	1972799	All right, let's get into some gaming news.
1972819	1975320	We're like, what, 30 minutes in the show after a 15-minute late start.
1975360	1976421	We haven't even covered news yet.
1977041	1979763	This is going to be a 10 o'clock at night show.
1979903	1981003	That's 1 a.m.
1981043	1981824	for you East Coasters.
1981864	1983785	Let's get started on some gaming news, Loki.
1984745	1987786	Okay, so the ESA did a survey.
1988707	1994529	I shouldn't really say a survey, but they did research focusing on 200 specific titles during the month of December.
1994709	1997410	Not necessarily stuff that came out in December, but just during that month.
1998211	2010576	And it showed that of those 200 titles, there were 9.78 million illegal downloads for those titles during the month of December.
2011276	2014258	And you might think, okay, well, maybe the U.S.
2014358	2018041	is to blame because there's a lot of people in the U.S.
2018061	2018461	that pirate.
2018881	2022804	But actually, no, there's other countries that were a lot higher.
2023244	2034492	In fact, the highest number of unauthorized downloads came from Italy with 20.3% of the total, Spain following that with 12.5%, France with 7.5%, and China with 5.7%.
2041437	2041937	I blame Luxembourg
2057119	2059621	The countries I think of are not the ones you're naming.
2059681	2074531	Like, I usually think, you know, because of the stereotypes about being able to buy bootlegs in Hong Kong, like right on the street corners, and, you know, knowing of all that that goes on, I would think it's like Hong Kong, Taiwan, those would be the types of places that would be the tops for piracy, but Italy?
2075292	2083818	Now, pardon my ignorance for those overseas listeners, but I've never even been over to the other side of the Atlantic, so sorry, I know we have a lot of listeners over there because we try to
2084498	2087421	Let every gamer have a voice, including our friends from overseas.
2087961	2093966	But is there something about Italy where the distribution that gets to the rest of Europe doesn't get there or something?
2094226	2094847	I have no idea.
2095407	2103093	But they said also that of those 10 million, those aren't even really a full picture of what's being downloaded.
2103474	2107317	I think it's just all Modern Warfare 2 is probably what it was.
2107918	2137209	well because my thought is you know is that I've gotten into this topic before and I don't know if it was on a call with Bobby's show at the end or if it was on this show but that I think a lot of this piracy comes from folks that can't get the game through legal means turn to piracy and that's why I kind of question well does Italy get game releases when the rest of you know those countries over there get them or is there something about Italy where in Spain and some of those other countries you named where they don't get the games at the same time so people turn to piracy
2138870	2144274	Are there laws where maybe the game has to be in a local language, like Italian or Spanish, so they can't release them there?
2144314	2144595	I don't know.
2144675	2145075	I don't know.
2145195	2153441	I don't really hear a lot of just, you know, I don't really hear of anything being delayed there, but I mean, I don't really know.
2153481	2158265	We never hear like, you know, Italy's not getting the game because it's been censored or something like that.
2158285	2161327	It's always Germany or New Zealand or Australia.
2161547	2162468	They got to catch them all.
2163345	2166566	Well, I would love to hear from a listener, because I know we have some listeners over there.
2166606	2170447	So if you are listening and you're one of those countries Loki named, I would love to get an email from you.
2171188	2173708	Why do you think piracy is so rampant where you live?
2173828	2177250	I mean, is the legal just difficult or expensive or what?
2177510	2178170	Because I think...
2179941	2182283	I don't know, why do people turn to piracy in the US?
2182363	2185765	Because they blame the $60 price point of a console game.
2186386	2189588	I'm too poor, I'm a starving student, or whatever it is.
2189848	2195873	Try to justify it with the whole Robin Hood philosophy of steal from the rich and give to the poor.
2195973	2198915	That's what motivates most piracy.
2200016	2202338	I'm not saying a good thing about that, I'm just saying what I see.
2202638	2203899	That's just kind of what it seems to be.
2204099	2205200	It's the whole Robin Hood approach.
2207234	2209235	Anyhow, well, be careful.
2209255	2211315	I don't think it's as altruistic as Robin Hood's intent.
2212655	2214596	It's rob from the rich and give to me.
2215476	2216656	Okay, fair enough.
2217297	2220457	Speaking of piracy, you might want to be a little bit careful if you're into that.
2220497	2222918	Keep in mind, piracy is not legal.
2223038	2223738	Just a reminder.
2224138	2225538	So you are walking a dangerous line.
2226119	2229839	And that is evidenced by what's going on in Australia right now.
2229899	2232200	In fact, when I first read this story, I was like,
2232560	2233161	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2252220	2259444	Apparently, Gadgetgear.com.au, because all the Australian ones ended AU, they were actually told they have to stop selling the device.
2259524	2264687	They got fined the equivalent of $466,000 US dollars.
2265587	2276292	The folks that were named in the suit, Patrick Lee and James Lee, I guess they also kind of sold this independently, not through the same site, but they also were fined $100,000 Australian.
2276332	2277613	That's about $90,000 here Australian.
2279695	2286829	Also, what I think is interesting as part of the settlement, or I'm sorry, not settlement, but suit, they have to disclose who is supplying the R4 chips.
2287307	2287667	Hmm.
2288508	2294332	So that again is just, that's the second in like a week's time of Nintendo winning some anti-piracy stuff.
2294352	2302817	I think it's dumb that they, you know, I mean, those chips, I understand that they can be used for piracy, but a computer can be used for piracy.
2302957	2306220	So, you know, we're going to make computers legal now too?
2306420	2312744	I mean, it's just, you have to go after the, sadly enough, you have to go after the people that are using the pirate stuff.
2313384	2316527	Or, I don't know, here's a thought, go after people putting ROMs online.
2317908	2324337	it won't matter if you have the stupid chip for your DS because it won't work with anything there's no fucking ROMs out there
2326209	2328030	Oddly enough, I kind of agree with you.
2328210	2333934	And I think your computer analogy, even though I don't own an R4 and I don't think I would get into all this stuff.
2334314	2335755	I have two and a G3.
2337055	2337976	I have two Ninja Passes.
2339217	2341078	Okay.
2341998	2344240	I feel like I'm too stupid to really get into all that stuff.
2344260	2349203	I don't know what it is, but I think if I had one, I'd want to play homebrew stuff on it is probably what I would be into.
2349243	2349783	Yeah, that's pretty fun.
2350803	2355584	I like having the real deal because then I know I'm going to get online and not get my system bricked and all that.
2355604	2358045	I'm willing to pay the extra money just for ease of mind in that regard.
2359725	2371528	But as far as the R4 stuff goes, I think when you buy a device like that, yeah, I should be able to use the parts for whatever I want as long as I'm not – I get the problem with piracy.
2371548	2375509	You're stealing someone else's property that they spent money to create.
2375529	2376649	It's going after the wrong people.
2376809	2387961	But if somebody wants to put a free ROM on the internet for their free public domain, just like somebody puts their music up on MySpace, they want you to download it and listen to it to get their band name out there.
2388221	2398633	It's just like people, it'd be like going after somebody or a camcorder company because somebody used it to pirate a film.
2399773	2400433	Thanks for watching!
2422659	2422979	I don't know.
2441055	2441575	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2470149	2471249	I even got bored of that.
2472130	2473850	I shouldn't be getting bored of a Zelda game.
2474650	2475651	I mean, come on, it's Zelda.
2475691	2476291	It's awesome.
2477471	2481212	Do you think maybe your expectations have kind of raised?
2481232	2487654	No, but they didn't really do that much different other than, look, now Link's riding a train instead of a boat.
2488174	2490034	I mean, it's the same damn game.
2490194	2494936	Okay, I'm going to take the tangent train for a minute here, but we kind of got into it a couple weeks ago on the show.
2494956	2498577	I remember talking about Game Room and some of these old arcade games and Atari 2600 games.
2499657	2517808	and some folks saying that you know they're repetitive they're boring and I'm thinking that's what it was all about back when you know those games first came out what's wrong with you you know like are we just have our expectations about what makes a good game like changed in that regard I guess they have to some extent you know you it would be like this
2518468	2522409	It would be like saying, okay, I'm playing Pac-Man.
2522869	2523570	Pac-Man's cool.
2524230	2531172	And then we come out with Pac-Man 2, which is exactly the same as Pac-Man 1, except now the screen is blue and purple instead of yellow and blue.
2531592	2533953	That's basically the difference between... That's Ms.
2533973	2534373	Pac-Man.
2535633	2536754	But she has a bow in her hair.
2536774	2538754	She has a bow, and it's slightly different.
2538794	2547197	But no, seriously, it's almost like they've said, okay, what can we do to put the least amount of effort into this so we can release a sequel really quick?
2548317	2549178	And yes, I understand.
2549258	2553881	Ooh, it's... I mean, they don't even try to tie any of the games storyline-wise together.
2554581	2567770	Oh, yes, it's another adventurer who happens to look the same as Link, and his name is Link, and now he's gotta go rescue this Princess Zelda, who's not the same Princess Zelda, even though she looked exactly the same as the last game.
2567810	2569491	Don't they gotta do that in all the Zelda games?
2570512	2572713	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2600006	2608808	No, there is a bit more about EA servers being a big clank putting on them.
2609668	2628932	On March 16th, we have service shutdown for Death Jam for PS3, Godfather for PS3 and Xbox 360, Lord of the Rings Conquest, Mercenaries 2, Need for Speed Carbon on portable, Need for Speed Pro Street PSP, Simpsons for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and
2630132	2635215	April 15th, Burnout 3, Takedown, Army of Two for PS3, but that's only in Asia.
2636316	2642959	And, of course, we have a ton of original Xbox being shut down after that and PS2 games.
2643039	2649503	So, yeah, pretty much everything that's Xbox, PS2 earlier, and Tiger Woods.
2651044	2651184	So...
2652073	2658116	You know, I'm surprised that, I mean, there's some of the games on there, like Simpsons, I don't remember there being online for that.
2658896	2666239	It was funny, though, because even, like, Def Jam Icon, that was one of those games, oh, yeah, you can put your music in there and, you know, play and stuff.
2666299	2672442	I'm like, oh, yeah, if we put some weird, like, DDR music in there, that'd be really funny, because it's meant for more, like, hip-hop stuff.
2672542	2672802	Yeah.
2673862	2674103	Oh, well.
2674643	2674883	Yeah.
2676020	2679044	And it's not really surprising.
2679264	2682228	I mean, it costs money to run the servers.
2683229	2689516	And if they're not making any more money on these games and new stuff's going to be coming out, what's the point of keeping it around?
2690021	2693845	There's a lot of companies out there that don't really have these servers that they shut down.
2694005	2698669	EA is the main one we hear about every now and then.
2699070	2705055	I think we had one from Sega when they shut down the server for Chromehounds.
2705956	2710000	Those are the only ones I've heard of for a while.
2711321	2712062	That's kind of interesting.
2712751	2719196	Well, and, you know, Xbox original getting shut down is, you know, somewhat notable, you know.
2720116	2722038	But that's just a matter of time.
2722618	2726801	But I don't understand, like, current generation stuff, the servers being shut down for them.
2726841	2728362	I mean, that's just kind of weird.
2729123	2736048	I can understand, like, you know, okay, yeah, we're moving on to the PlayStation 4, you know, the PlayStation Network for PlayStation 3 is going to have to go away now.
2736128	2740471	But keep in mind, also looking, again, economy-wise, you know,
2741883	2743704	A lot of companies are losing money anyway.
2743864	2747466	If they're trying to mitigate... I fully believe that it's to mitigate cost.
2747706	2748106	I really do.
2748646	2749506	I think that's part of it too.
2749587	2753868	And Loki, as you said earlier, you play Grand Theft Auto and nobody's ever online.
2755149	2757370	I'm kind of surprised they're not threatening to pull the plug on that.
2757430	2759611	If people aren't using it, it's costing them to keep the servers up.
2759631	2761032	They are just not playing what I'm playing.
2761192	2761472	I see.
2761992	2769141	There's specific settings because we play with auto-aim off and some newbie players out there like to play with auto-aim on.
2769161	2770763	That would be me.
2771765	2779034	And so because of that, anybody that's searching for a game with auto-aim on, they're only going to find auto-aim on games.
2779194	2780496	So you have to specify that.
2780876	2781277	Thanks for watching!
2797479	2816325	for um the battle league atony there's at least 50,000 people on the ranked leaderboards um right now so um there's a lot of people out there it's just you know whether they may be wanting to play just free mode or just you know some other you know deathmatch non-ranked you know team deathmatch who knows
2818089	2821871	All right, chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to join us.
2822532	2827375	X-Link reminds us they've also shut down the servers for the PS2 and PC versions of Phantasy Star Universe.
2827415	2828756	That was another big recent one.
2829176	2832398	Phantasy Star Universe is starting to disappear, which is a pretty big deal.
2832758	2835760	But I'm kind of not surprised a lot of the communities on Xbox 360.
2836180	2839282	Wasn't that the only way you had the voice enabled in it too?
2839523	2840863	Maybe, yeah.
2841144	2843905	Well, of course you could always use something like Ventrilo or something on the PC, I suppose.
2845066	2846087	Well, let's move on.
2867003	2873605	Now, that doesn't sound too bad right now, but there's a few things, of course, you have to understand.
2874345	2894811	The system is kind of flawed, and the reason being is, for example, if your connection experiences any sort of issue, whether it be like drop in bandwidth or momentary pause, router reboot, or whatever, the software will immediately boot you out of your game back to the main menu, and you'll lose all your progress.
2899333	2901034	And that's it.
2901454	2913100	Also, if Ubisoft's master servers encounter any errors, then all the players with a working connection logged into the servers will not be able to play their games until the servers are back online.
2914020	2917182	Oh gee, Ubisoft's customer support isn't about to blow up or anything.
2918243	2922628	So, you know... Doesn't Ubisoft make the, like, Imagine games?
2923068	2923469	Yes, they do.
2923569	2927253	Okay, so I imagine there's equivalents of that on the PC, right?
2927553	2932239	Well, the main... The two titles that are going to be coming up... And this is a Korean PC game where they tested...
2932699	2935821	The two upcoming titles, Assassin's Creed 2 and Settlers 7.
2938062	2943084	I don't think they have any Imagine games for a PC, but they would have this DRM if they did.
2943465	2944905	And that's where I'm going with this.
2944965	2951769	Not everybody that would be buying a game like that is tech-savvy enough to understand what DRM even is.
2953310	2953870	Certainly not.
2954110	2959853	The type of people that buy those Imagine games are probably not the same people that listen to this podcast, unless of course they're buying it for their kids.
2960413	2960674	You know...
2961814	2973767	My point is, you're going to have these moms buying it for their daughters and people that don't really follow gaming or understand what DRM even is that just know the game isn't going to fire up on the computer.
2973807	2975148	Who's going to get the phone call about that?
2975448	2980434	The phone calls are going to go to Ubisoft or they're going to go to Targets and Walmarts across the country.
2981074	2984157	And when that starts happening, they're going to stop carrying it.
2984958	2992228	Exactly, and I have a feeling that this will be cracked in probably a few days.
2992288	2995733	Well, usually those types of things are, and people are going to turn to that.
2996218	2997959	And sadly, what's going to end up happening?
2997979	3006542	But unfortunately, soccer mom Jones, who buys this for her daughter, you'll imagine, I don't know, dress-up shop or whatever they come out with.
3006722	3007903	How many of those Imagine games are there?
3007923	3008723	We were at Target last night.
3008743	3009203	Too many.
3009323	3010984	How many of those Imagine games were there on the shelf, Alan?
3011024	3012585	Like 5,000, right?
3012745	3013585	At least a dozen, yeah.
3013925	3015846	What were some Imagine titles that caught your eye?
3017921	3023105	Right next to Cooking Mama, 1, 2, 3, and Gardening Mama, and just everything.
3023846	3024226	Crazy.
3025927	3030211	Anyhow, while we're talking about online authentication, I think this is kind of interesting.
3030251	3037797	It's almost like a combination of the past couple stories we've been hearing about server costs to maintain, as well as a little bit about the DRM.
3039197	3041358	Socom, Fireteam, Bravo 3.
3041978	3051000	If you are going to be playing this game on the PSP, you're going to get a code so that you can go and redeem it on the PlayStation Network and you'll be able to access the game online.
3051540	3063262	But if you don't buy this game either directly through PSM because it will automatically be enabled or you get the code new, you'll have to shell out $20 to get the license to let you play online.
3063722	3064603	Think about that for a minute.
3064863	3065963	What that basically means is
3066543	3081204	they're kind of targeting people who are going after this used or the people who buy this second hand because think about it if you buy it new you'll get a code if you buy it online you don't need a code because you bought it online but if you buy it used no code for you well it's for piracy really
3082295	3082555	DarkSakura.com
3103962	3107563	Sony actually has a workaround for it in their own system.
3108143	3112005	And the reason this is, granted, you can't play online games.
3112685	3119847	But thanks to that wonderful, and I don't remember what the hell it's called now, but remember how you can do ad hoc over the internet with Sony PlayStation 3?
3121007	3124349	Well, guess I don't need to go online to play other people online.
3124709	3129010	I can just go ad hoc over the internet, and it works just fine.
3129110	3130250	It's not lag city or anything?
3130571	3131131	No, it shouldn't be.
3131371	3131851	Interesting.
3132540	3151669	by the way John Culler from Sony actually was quoted to IGN saying it's quote a trial run for a new initiative we are exploring for the platform so even if you're like ah fuck it I don't play SOCOM this could still be in the future impacting a game you play they're waiting to see how long it's cracked and it probably will get cracked somehow
3153570	3156011	You don't think the used thing has anything to do with it?
3156191	3157932	Oh, I'm sure that it has a little bit to do with it.
3157992	3163235	That's why they also were testing out the market with, like, Member Local... Not Local Roku 2.
3164476	3165536	Patapon 2, I think.
3166117	3171800	Where they had the game in a retail box, but all it was was a card with a scratch-off code.
3171820	3173040	Oh, yeah.
3173080	3174261	I saw that at Fry's, yeah.
3174561	3175742	You know, so that's another thing.
3175762	3177443	They were test marketing, so...
3178664	3183469	I'm just thinking, if I were to pick up this game used, I'd be kind of irritated that then I have to go online and pay another $20.
3184190	3188835	Like, again, here we go with the angry phone calls from people who don't know better to this time GameStop.
3189195	3198285	And if I were GameStop, you know, and you can use that term loosely to describe whatever game store makes their bread and butter off of used games and happens to sell new games as well, I'd be kind of pissed.
3198345	3198785	And I would...
3199446	3227753	like can you imagine especially with such a powerhouse that GameStop is and we'll just throw in all the other you know like companies in there okay like the powerhouse that they are with something like this kind of going after their used market can you imagine if they were to say and they have the power to do this they run a magazine for heaven's sake they could discourage people from buying the game think about it what's to stop I mean this this might be a little conspiracy theory here but what's to stop GameStop from publishing a negative review in this game
3228493	3244933	and Game Informer which is the most popular video game magazine out there that happens to be run by GameStop to discourage people from buying this game for no other reason than it cuts into the used game market but yet they use this whole they're going to get to with the $20 thing as the reason but the real reason is the bottom line of the game stores
3245273	3245873	Thanks for watching!
3261738	3280559	but I would think at the same time that this could be bad for Sony anyways because when a competing game comes out there let's see, am I going to buy the game that won't let me play online unless I pay $20 or the other game that's equally cool that I can play online for free that's a tough one I will go with the free one
3283139	3288826	Let's see, TigerClaw in our chatroom, chat.orange.com says, I wonder, what if Sony sells this game in twos?
3289166	3292269	For example, what if you want to only buy the multiplayer part?
3292350	3295793	Couldn't you just purchase the multiplayer game itself and not the full single player?
3297255	3298817	And here's the problem, too, with the SOCOM 3.
3299217	3299878	It's not...
3302200	3303600	It's a discounted game.
3304241	3305701	It's a full-price game.
3306661	3316844	So, it's not like, hey, we're selling this for $20, but if you want to go online, you can pay the other $20, and then equal the cost of a full-price game.
3317224	3319445	No, it's nothing like that, where they're offering it at a discount.
3319565	3322286	It's a full-price game, and then you have to pay another $20 on top of it.
3322987	3323848	Well, you know what I say.
3323908	3325289	If you don't like it, don't buy it.
3325949	3326449	End of story.
3326830	3327991	I mean, that's really what it is.
3328031	3328971	If you don't like it, don't buy it.
3329292	3332174	But, I mean, a game like this, SOCOM has its fan base.
3332914	3336136	There's people that aren't even going to bat an eye at this because they're already going to buy the game new.
3336917	3337557	They'll find a way.
3339138	3339759	We'll see what happens.
3340479	3341460	Let's move on with some more stories.
3341480	3345343	We've got release dates coming up as well as the classic game of the week in a little bit here on Orange Launch Radio.
3346576	3348557	Well, this is some good news.
3348677	3349498	How about something happy?
3349598	3350138	Yay, happy.
3350278	3351779	At least happy for me because I'm playing it.
3351799	3352780	You're going to give me money?
3353020	3353661	Yay!
3353701	3354561	I'm not playing that game.
3354581	3356382	I'm so happy.
3357103	3357743	Star Trek.
3358164	3359004	Star Trek Online.
3359684	3366329	They are actually working on ways of opening up the ship so that you can explore more of your own ship.
3367269	3370371	You know, so far all you can do is go hang out on the bridge and that's kind of boring.
3370792	3374034	You know, I look at my Andorian dude just, you know, piloting.
3374074	3375875	I'm like, okay, he's piloting.
3376806	3378387	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3398784	3399905	It is happy for me.
3400246	3401427	I said it was happy for me.
3402147	3409313	But they basically want to make it more, you know, do what they can to make it more like actual Star Trek.
3410414	3416700	And this is something that they've quoted as saying that it's something that they want to do, but they're not going to implement it until they have it working flawlessly.
3417981	3418361	I want a holodeck.
3418381	3418421	No.
3433345	3434786	Starboard Bow, Starboard Bow, Starboard Bow
3463342	3464623	That was nerdier than what I said.
3489684	3496069	Um, on Xbox 360, Risen, the ever-delayed game now coming out on Xbox 360.
3496290	3498251	I believe the PC version came out last October.
3499552	3502434	Uh, lovely Lisa and Friends on the DS.
3502474	3505016	Apparently it's from the Tommy Corporation.
3505056	3506758	I believe it's a doll that's actually in Japan.
3507018	3509220	Why this is being brought out over here is beyond me.
3509320	3510140	Because she's lovely.
3510621	3510961	I guess...
3512302	3518786	Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii DS, and PSP.
3522309	3526231	And, of course, that's going to feature all your favorite Sega characters.
3526812	3530414	And Banjo-Kazooie, of course, in the Xbox 360 version.
3533156	3534137	Let's see here.
3537256	3551957	Hello Kitty Birthday Adventures on DS Napoleon Total War coming out on PC Pony Friends 2 coming out on DS Anything our listeners might actually want to buy?
3553118	3555580	Wait, you're saying Pony Friends 2 is not on the top of their list?
3555640	3557282	You know, I'm thinking no.
3557482	3559924	Well, that's too bad.
3559984	3562706	Heavy Rain coming out on PlayStation 3 this week as well.
3563647	3566890	And then, let's see, wrapping it up.
3567530	3569672	Deck of Sports on DS.
3571714	3573716	Oh, Deck of Sports was the one that had curling in it, right?
3574697	3577079	Yes, I'm not sure if the DS version has curling in it.
3578059	3579661	I love Winter Olympics time of year.
3580512	3581733	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3595780	3596040	Sure.
3596241	3596561	Alright.
3597301	3603006	Coming out on February 25th on the Xbox 360, a localized version of Borderlands comes out from 2K Games.
3603466	3606769	Also a game called Esp Galuda 2.
3607229	3610312	A black label comes out in limited edition and regular formats.
3610352	3611353	Of course, there's a 2 there.
3611433	3613514	It is the sequel to Esp Galuda.
3613554	3615416	And if you've never heard of it, that's because it's a shmup.
3615896	3616537	So shoot them up.
3617038	3622667	Very colorful, seizure-inducing graphics where most of your screen is taken up with an overlay because it's a vertical shooter.
3622707	3625852	But you know there are some hardcore shmup fans out there.
3627788	3630009	So I'm sure they'll be picking this up without delay.
3631169	3637191	Also, No Fate, Only the Power of Will comes out from Alchemist on February the 25th on the Xbox 360.
3637271	3638391	Not sure what this game's all about.
3639011	3644093	Of course, it's got anime girls all over it, but this chick who's getting out of the pool is kind of angry.
3644193	3645353	I don't know why she's so angry.
3645393	3646133	She's getting out of the pool there.
3646153	3646634	She looks like Atena.
3646894	3649595	It's an adventure game, and this other chick's just dreaming.
3649875	3653476	But I like to think that maybe she is looking at the chick getting out of the pool, and that's what's making her angry.
3653856	3654136	I don't know.
3654836	3659100	Anyhow, that made for a much funnier in-studio than it did radio.
3659140	3659921	I apologize for that.
3660742	3662644	I snorted my root beer if that makes you feel better.
3662704	3663324	It does, a little bit.
3663605	3665687	And there is no curling in DexportsDS.
3666397	3666757	Fail.
3667618	3668658	A million times fail.
3669279	3671880	PlayStation 3, a price reduction on Demon's Souls.
3671920	3673801	If you haven't picked that up yet, you really should.
3674101	3674582	It's awesome.
3674622	3681085	That's pretty much the only thing to look forward to on PlayStation 3 unless you need some new HDMI cables because some third parties are putting some more of those out.
3681526	3687749	But the Nintendo Wii has a lot this week, which is good because they've had some quiet weeks lately, including Ark Rise Fantasia is coming out.
3688409	3690411	Minas No Susume selection.
3690471	3692492	I think that might be just a price reduction then.
3692512	3694373	I think, yeah, Ark Rise Fantasia I think has already been out.
3694953	3696074	Just a price reduction there.
3696114	3697455	It's kind of like a best hits over there.
3698075	3701817	As far as new games go, Rajironogia Wii.
3702078	3704519	That's the sequel to Radergy.
3705220	3706600	I don't know if I'm even saying that right.
3707121	3707561	Radergy.
3707881	3708402	Radergy.
3709122	3710363	There's like an extra R in here.
3711083	3713625	Another shmup, basically, but this time on the Wii.
3713665	3715466	Radio Allergy, as it's called over here.
3715686	3717528	Fushigi no Dungeon, Furai no Shiren 4, Kami no Hitomi no Akuma no Heso
3742369	3742749	Mystery Dungeon
3757972	3761878	I don't know if it's a... I don't know what language.
3762759	3765223	But the guy's wearing kind of a funny hat.
3765503	3766144	He's got a monkey.
3766444	3768607	It's the funny hat game featuring monkey.
3770570	3772853	Also, Super Robot Taisen OG Saga.
3773474	3775055	There's a series we can't get rid of.
3775075	3775535	That's right.
3775595	3776416	It's never going away.
3776896	3787182	And on the PSP, BlazBlue Portable comes out this week as well as Katekyou Hitman Reborn, Kizuna No Tag Battle, which is, of course, a fighting game.
3787202	3789143	You can tell they're on the PSP.
3789724	3795147	I'm not sure if this is based off an anime, but this looks like that one where you can do four people at a time all playing at once.
3796308	3796868	Looks like fun.
3797508	3799850	That's going to do it for your Japanese release dates.
3800957	3804039	Metal Slug XX Metal Slug XX Metal Slug XX Metal Slug
3826980	3835251	Alright, let's do just a couple more stories and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week and I believe DarkSakura has picked a true classic for you guys tonight.
3836012	3837634	It better like it.
3838254	3841278	You know, I picked the most piss your pants title I could think of.
3841799	3844703	And it ties in with a game that we had coming out this week as well.
3846809	3847550	We'll get there in a minute.
3870872	3873615	I don't know why they're... I didn't even know there were sci-fi kids.
3873975	3875857	Do they make crappy children's shows too?
3875977	3876317	I didn't know.
3876357	3880060	Well, they did like a Wizard of Oz and an Alice in Wonderland.
3880080	3883703	Yeah, which were all really like... They were like dark, weren't they?
3883723	3884484	They were weird.
3884784	3885104	Yeah.
3886306	3886666	I don't know.
3887767	3894113	So apparently, though, they're going to be working with the Diplob character.
3894253	3895635	Maybe there'll be a cartoon show.
3895675	3896015	Who knows?
3897216	3898418	Will a Cylon show up?
3898458	3901100	I mean, maybe there's Battlestar Galactica, Caprica.
3901220	3902382	I don't think there's anything there.
3902422	3905525	When I think of sci-fi network, I think of BSG.
3905605	3906145	I can't help it.
3906245	3908848	I think of crappy sci-fi movies that are normally on there.
3908888	3909589	That's true.
3909649	3910589	What is that?
3910689	3911510	Is that from Sci-Fi Network?
3911530	3912811	The shark meet octopus?
3912891	3913672	Or what is it?
3913712	3914653	The flying shark?
3914673	3916734	Yeah, where the shark eats a plane out of the sky.
3916914	3917215	Yes.
3917395	3917755	Yeah.
3918255	3919736	That's all those lovely Sci-Fi movies.
3919757	3921398	Yeah, they show them on the soup all the time, right?
3921778	3922018	Yeah.
3922178	3922679	Oh, good times.
3922699	3923600	With Deborah Gibson.
3923960	3924220	Yes.
3924300	3926722	Because, you know, she's a woman now, so no longer Debbie.
3926802	3927182	That's right.
3928383	3936826	Um, and then the other thing, of course, the blob is also gonna be not just on the Wii this time, it's also supposed to be coming to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3937766	3943128	Um, also, there's gonna be some new Saints Row and Red Faction at E3 this year.
3943809	3954733	Uh, of course, Saints Row 3 is not supposed to be coming out until 2011, which makes me very sad, but the new Red Faction game is supposed to be slated for later this year, so, um, that might be cool.
3955013	3955733	And then, um,
3957646	3960564	So I guess we'll have to wait until E3 to check those out.
3961843	3966546	Okay, I have to go back to the sci-fi thing for a minute because, like, the blob game, yeah, that's cool.
3966766	3970168	I remember playing the blob at PAX a couple years ago, of all places.
3970208	3972430	So, you know, and I remember Loki really enjoyed it, too.
3972510	3973370	So don't get me wrong.
3973410	3977233	I'm glad that game is getting a sequel if sci-fi is putting it out or however it's coming out.
3977553	3979354	But seriously... It's still THQ, yeah.
3979454	3983677	Why aren't they making, like, the shark and octopus video game?
3983777	3989201	Like, when Alan was saying that sharks eat planes out of the sky, like, that sounds awesome.
3989221	3990682	Because the movie was awful.
3990962	3991122	But...
3992264	3993145	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4011981	4014843	and you destroy things and Debra Gibson does a voice.
4015043	4016084	Wouldn't you want to buy that game?
4016484	4017084	Fuck yes!
4017524	4017825	See?
4018205	4022807	Well, okay, they put out the Jaws game, which granted was awesome because you can maybe- Fuck Jaws!
4023208	4026109	I'm talking- Did Jaws eat a plane out of the sky?
4026390	4026850	It could've.
4026870	4028491	No, he chased around Richard Dreyfuss.
4028551	4029031	Boo hoo.
4029451	4029892	Landshark.
4030032	4031593	The guy's got one foot in the grave.
4031653	4032033	Come on.
4035435	4036635	Did it have Debra Gibson?
4036736	4037456	I don't think so.
4039777	4040838	Chatroom, am I crazy?
4041949	4042789	Well, we knew that.
4043809	4045110	No, I mean for real about this.
4045730	4047490	Chat, would you or would you not want to play that game?
4047830	4051511	Actdeft in chat says, President Cat vs. Flying Shark Octopus.
4052892	4053352	There you go.
4053792	4056373	DarkTetsuya says, Screw President Cat, I want that game.
4056673	4060554	Look, I am all about these lol what the fuck random games.
4060594	4062834	You ought to know that by now, listening to this show.
4062894	4064195	Unless this is your first time listening.
4064435	4065515	Which again, I apologize.
4067045	4067385	What is that?
4067405	4068446	Is that something someone linked to?
4068466	4072608	Uncovering the secrets of Mega Shark, Death in the Skies.
4072689	4083015	Hold on, SSJ, I hate to do this in the middle of the show, but SSJ100Matt is linking us to this YouTube, and just knowing SSJ100Matt, I think this is important.
4083055	4083635	Holy shit!
4095872	4098955	The shark is eating the plane.
4100897	4102819	That needs to be on the end and the birds fly away.
4103180	4104301	Why is that not on the Wii?
4105102	4108625	Why is that not being optioned for a video game?
4108705	4111408	That was 50 kinds of awesome.
4112889	4113930	It's so awful.
4114151	4115932	You're only encouraging these people.
4117932	4119593	Video games are kind of stupid.
4119673	4120713	Loki, welcome.
4122014	4126597	I mean, I realize there are some video games out there with deep plots and all this stuff, but come on.
4127417	4128738	That just screams America.
4128818	4129418	Fuck yeah.
4129598	4130699	Sharks eating planes.
4134100	4135001	I just like this scene.
4135021	4135921	Dude looks out the window.
4135981	4136582	Shark!
4137082	4144466	I assure you that watching the two seconds of that aren't necessarily as good as watching a full 90-minute movie.
4146798	4151721	Imagine you're sitting down with a Nintendo Wii and then all of a sudden... Holy shit!
4156964	4158645	Why would a shark attack a plane?
4159266	4160226	It makes no sense.
4161187	4168831	Why do fighting characters decide to fight to the death and throw fireballs at each other and do spinning bird kicks and all the other bullshit?
4168871	4169532	Come on!
4169972	4171013	It's a video game.
4171293	4172494	Sharks can eat planes.
4173274	4174455	In fact, that should be in Street Fighter V.
4176826	4178527	Maybe it could be in Civilization 5.
4178607	4180088	That's right, there is a Civilization 5.
4180188	4181289	How'd you like that transition?
4181549	4183370	There is a Civilization 5 announced.
4183631	4184731	It is coming fall of 2010.
4185372	4186573	Of course, this made me squee.
4186593	4187933	You know I love my Civilization.
4188174	4191416	I think Civilization 1 is like my favorite PC game they've ever made.
4191816	4198020	But good old Sid Meier and Civilization series, a fifth installment coming out from 2K Games this fall, 2010.
4199361	4204124	And I shouldn't be surprised at this news, although I have to admit this was news I kind of wasn't expecting.
4204464	4206126	But then the news came out this week and I was like,
4206906	4208488	Fuck yeah, another Civilization!
4209328	4209849	Cool!
4210149	4211711	I wasn't expecting it, but cool.
4211731	4213072	Because the fourth one was actually really good.
4213092	4214453	It was probably my favorite next to the first one.
4214774	4216715	But they are talking about it's going to be an all-new engine.
4216735	4219138	The biggest change, the most shocking change, if you will.
4219458	4222701	They have switched to hexagon tiles instead of square-based tiles.
4222761	4223762	It's now going to be hexagon.
4223782	4228787	So think Catan meets Civilization, or Catanalization, if you will, is what I'm calling this game.
4229267	4229808	So there it is.
4231609	4242817	It's going to have, of course, the leaders will be all animated and the landscapes will be all nice and new combats, new diplomacy, and mods, mods, mods, because they are embracing of the mod community, which is very cool.
4242897	4244639	Don't expect this to come out on consoles, though.
4245239	4248301	It's just too much micromanaging in Civilization game.
4248321	4249803	It really can't be done on a console.
4249883	4256868	But, of course, there is Civ Revolution, which took some flack from Civ fans because it kind of dumbed down the series, if you will.
4257628	4260629	I'll tell you what, I think Civ Revolution is a great introduction to the series.
4260769	4262969	I think it was an overlooked game on consoles.
4263009	4263870	I think it was a lot of fun.
4264250	4272091	I don't think it compares to the PC versions, but I think if you're just not much of a PC gamer or want a game that is low-key on your console, go for it.
4272151	4273432	Civ Network's pretty cool.
4274712	4279493	Yeah, I'm looking forward to Civilization V. Gonna get your Civ on?
4280813	4284116	Oh yeah, I might have to actually put down WoW to try this out for a little while.
4285236	4286898	Alan, I know you play some PC games.
4286938	4289680	You play a pretty big mix of PC and console games, right?
4289880	4290040	Yep.
4290281	4291542	Do you play Civilization at all?
4292382	4292943	Not really.
4293123	4294004	I don't know if this is going to work.
4294204	4299889	No, but seriously though, you play a lot of shooter type games, right?
4299909	4301390	What kind of PC games are you into?
4302250	4319377	lots of first person shooters love Bioshock and Half-Life as far as Civ, a game like Civ I was really into Rise of Nations which was sort of a Civ clone that came out by Big Huge Games under Microsoft's Game Studios label so yeah, I played that very cool
4321092	4330494	Alright, before we get to the classic game of the week, I was sent another YouTube from SSJ100Matt in private.
4330554	4331394	I have to watch this.
4332594	4335255	This is the shark.
4335295	4340796	Yeah, eats the Golden Gate Bridge just like that.
4344556	4345897	During midday commute too.
4346237	4347337	How rude of that shark.
4350692	4351733	If that was in a video game?
4352914	4354195	I won't play as the fucking shark.
4355476	4356117	Exactly.
4356757	4358559	That's why Jaws didn't sell, Loki.
4358819	4360620	Can Jaws eat the Golden Gate Bridge?
4361001	4361221	No.
4394860	4396262	Can I do my bit, Rob?
4396342	4397903	I guess you can do your bit.
4398203	4402086	You've been very patient and suffering through an hour and a half of OLR tonight.
4402727	4405850	Actually, it's only an hour and 15 minutes, but we were here in the studio for quite a bit beforehand.
4406610	4411715	Classic Game of the Week, etc., etc., goes into the vault, finds a game, blah, blah, blah, picks one for you, and it's great.
4411815	4412095	Yeah?
4412635	4413036	Yes!
4414837	4417920	Our Game of the Week is Shenmue!
4419521	4420322	Yay!
4420382	4422364	Why, yes, I would like to try a game of Lucky Hit.
4424421	4430923	Um, all I found was, like, just the soundtrack stuff, because, really, I was getting tired of listening to Rio talk.
4432643	4433503	Asking about sailors.
4434003	4438004	I know, the sailors one, I was just, I had to go back and watch that.
4438344	4439905	Do you have sailors that come in here?
4440405	4445766	Well, sometimes they come in at night, but they leave before it gets too late.
4446586	4447847	The lady of most, yeah.
4448427	4448627	Anyway.
4450047	4454491	Shenmue is one of the masterpieces of Yu Suzuki.
4456894	4463179	It's really meant for interactive and to be a free-form sort of environment.
4464140	4471207	And, you know, you have real-life aspects like you go to bed, you get up in the morning, you pee.
4471347	4473329	Well, I don't know, they clearly don't show I'm peeing.
4473789	4479820	but you can also go to vending machines and arcades and you can like play classic games in the arcades which is awesome
4481761	4487365	and he has a video game system in his house, has convenience stores.
4489226	4491788	So it's really open as for what you could do.
4492548	4507579	But with the characters in there, basically the overall story is that Ryo comes home and finds them beating up his dad and then he gets smacked around and then his dad tells him where to find something that he's looking for and the game goes from there.
4508619	4508840	So...
4510822	4516026	You know, so you go around and you actually are trying to track down this guy and trying to figure out what's going on.
4516587	4522692	And you have to talk to all the people and you have to do rescues and you have to go against these other guys.
4522752	4524733	It's a big investigation, you know.
4526295	4528156	And you just play as this guy.
4529077	4531419	And you can also raise kittens.
4532240	4532940	You can feed kittens.
4532960	4533641	Oh, well, I'm sold.
4534681	4535462	They're cute little kittens.
4538084	4538645	But, um...
4540370	4567018	The game was... There were little quick time events that were in the game too where you would witness something and you would have to hit the right button at the right time and that's how a lot of the fighting went too and then it would go along with a cutscene and you had your little questing areas and you had your different battles and Ryo could fight because his dad ran a dojo and of course he was going to teach his kid.
4568399	4572646	The cool thing about this, though, is that it was supposed to be a killer app for the Saturn.
4574309	4575350	That was the big thing about it.
4576432	4580639	In fact, you can actually find online...
4583439	4587041	A video of the Saturn version.
4587061	4589923	It was pretty sweet for Saturn at the time.
4591624	4593786	But it was going to try to revive the Saturn.
4594206	4600510	But since the Dreamcast was coming out, they actually started working on Shenmue.
4600650	4602631	At the time it was Katana, remember?
4603332	4605253	That's right, I remember that, yeah.
4605413	4605633	Yeah.
4606694	4609455	And then what was being worked on was called Project Berkeley.
4610656	4612537	So there were tech demos out under that name.
4613277	4617399	And then it went into actual production for Dreamcast.
4617740	4625344	And every character that you run into in the game has... They had voice actors for.
4625884	4629286	In Japanese and English, a full orchestrated soundtrack.
4630406	4630546	And...
4631887	4635592	At that time, that level of voice acting was kind of unheard of too.
4635752	4637154	That was pretty awesome, I gotta say.
4637414	4641219	And then it had a weather system in the game called the Magic Weather System.
4642260	4642340	Um...
4643997	4659825	So when you go through the game, you have different, you know, things that are happening, but they actually were meant to reflect the actual weather conditions of Yokosuka at the time, which is where he lived in Japan.
4660726	4664428	And it was set in the 1986-1987.
4664708	4666629	So you can actually go and explore different parts of town, too.
4666649	4667069	Remember the 80s?
4668790	4671272	So this could have been happening concurrently with Karate Kid 2.
4671973	4672193	Yes.
4672433	4672653	Okay.
4673654	4680579	But I mean, you know, it's meant to be, you know, what Japan was like in the 80s in a little small town.
4681340	4685262	You know, in the Japanese version you had Coca-Cola stuff everywhere.
4685543	4692568	Which is funny, since Pepsi's, Pepsi Japan, their big thing was with, Sega's big thing was with Pepsi.
4693188	4694029	Remember they had Pepsi Man?
4694049	4694129	Yeah.
4695296	4701097	I remember in the Crazy Taxi games, you were going to all the Pepsi brand restaurants.
4701557	4705618	But they actually put out a couple of games in Japan that were Pepsi Man.
4706899	4708139	I remember that, yeah.
4708159	4710639	You could actually go on YouTube and look up little commercials of Pepsi Man.
4711520	4712420	So, anyway.
4712440	4716261	So I thought it was funny that they had Coca-Cola for that one everywhere.
4716401	4717021	And you know, and...
4719152	4729063	It was, you know, also with, they were trying to show exactly what, you know, people were like in that days, like the younger generation was going more towards a western look for things.
4729684	4734208	So you had your older generation in one style and your younger generation in a different style.
4735349	4744133	And you also had a passport disc that you could go in and view the cutscenes for the movies.
4744153	4745514	You could listen to the music.
4745954	4749996	You had information so you could learn about other things going on in the game and the characters.
4750056	4751977	You had the mini-games you could replay.
4753298	4754459	You had a free battle.
4755960	4757742	Just all kinds of interactive stuff.
4757822	4763927	And then you could use the passport to get to Shenmue World through the Dreamcast internet.
4765008	4770993	So it was just all kinds of... It had an online manual network ranking for all your things.
4771634	4776839	You could play with... You had VMU icons for your cute little VMU.
4777579	4797077	collectible items like the toy capsules which would be like ships from other games I had an OPA OPA your data review it was all kinds of stuff and you can also track everything that you've done in the game from how long you've played to how long you've done the mini games to how many soft drinks you've bought
4799125	4828014	and it of course discontinued when they cancelled Dreamcast production and there was a sequel of course which was Shenmue 2 but because it didn't sell very well Shenmue or Shenmue 2 we didn't get any more story that was it and there's people still holding their breath for Shenmue 3 and I have a feeling that we might see it one day but I like breathing
4829946	4838032	But, you know, they also did a figure that Dan showed me of Ryo driving a forklift.
4838933	4840994	There's also, he's in the Sega Racers game.
4841014	4845157	Yes, he is, and he's riding the motorbike, and he also rides the forklift.
4845658	4850742	But you can actually buy a figure, a recent figure that came out of Ryo riding a forklift.
4852743	4853444	Can I admit something?
4853864	4854204	Go for it.
4854224	4855005	I've never played this game.
4857028	4863510	I've heard about how fascinating it is I even had a Dreamcast but I just never really got around to playing this game Would you like to borrow my copy?
4863530	4865230	Would you like to play a game of Lucky Hit?
4866150	4882434	That's all I know There's some video where the dude just goes around asking everybody that and I kind of found it funny But I've always heard about its epic epicness You can play my copy if you want I don't even know if my Dreamcast is hooked up It's full of epic epicness like you just said
4882614	4882874	All right.
4883355	4885458	Shenmue, your classic game of the week.
4885678	4886279	So there it is.
4886719	4886960	All right.
4887000	4895030	We're going to take a break here at Orange Lounge Radio, but we've got plenty more to come tonight in Part B. We've got, of course, your phone calls and your Twitter topics if you haven't sent in any Twitter topics.
4895070	4897894	Go ahead and get those in right now to at OLR on Twitter.
4898835	4912261	We're going to get to the rapid fire news as well and then get to some other stories including kind of a surprising new iPhone game as well as some of the dates and things for the upcoming Xbox Live block party and some news on Fable 3.
4912301	4915883	We got all that coming up right after a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4922609	4927374	And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday night, February the 21st of 2010.
4928415	4931378	You are listening to that podcast where every gamer has a voice.
4931978	4935962	And you might not know this, but we have an Olympic gold medal for being awesome.
4936883	4939806	So we're going to talk about some more gaming news, of course, tonight.
4939846	4941768	Join us if you're listening live at All Games Radio.
4942128	4944691	Chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to be.
4945512	4955283	as you are listening live on this Sunday if you've never listened live before you really should join us sometime it's kind of a different show when you're listening live and as Alan is finding out tonight it's a really different show when you're sitting here in studio
4956001	4956101	Yes.
4956121	4956742	No, that's alright.
4956922	4957342	Yeah, I'm good.
4957362	4957863	Cheers, thanks a lot.
4977743	4995488	Yes, there's a cool fan-made 8-bit-esque Mega Man first-person shooter game that someone's made called Mega Man 8-Bit Deathmatch and features some of the original Mega Man characters and their kind of 8-bit glory, kind of almost like a Doom mod, but I don't think it is.
4996368	5015095	and yeah it's really sweet you can actually check it out on I believe it's cutstuff.net is where you can find that to download and apparently it's free at least they have a trailer of it and stuff I'm not sure when it's actually being released but it's pretty cool
5016243	5017144	Yeah, anyways.
5018825	5020946	So other things that are pretty cool.
5021466	5027090	There's a lot of stuff out there that are allowing you to buy a game and get something else for free.
5027150	5034355	For example, last week we talked about how if you were one of the people that bought Darksiders, you would get a code for a free Red Faction game.
5034815	5040739	Well, if you didn't happen to keep your mystery code with your copy of Darksiders, fear not.
5040979	5042040	You can still redeem...
5043040	5051724	A free copy of Red Faction Guerrilla, assuming that you have a copy of your receipt and some other stuff that they want you to send them copies of.
5052264	5056366	And with that, you'll get a free copy of Red Faction Guerrilla and a digital art book.
5057506	5061528	Also, another kind of bonus THQ is handing out.
5061968	5066850	With people that pre-ordered Dawn of War 2, the expansion to the Warhammer franchise...
5067610	5086103	you will be able to get Saints Row 2 on PC for free which is pretty cool and then of course THQ isn't the only ones doing that for Battlefield Bad Company 2 on PC if you happen to pre-order your copy through the EA store you will net yourself a free copy of Battlefield 2142 as well
5089454	5115651	and then finally if you happen not to play PC games and maybe bought a PSP Go during the last few weeks here you'll be able to redeem I guess a free copy of Assassin's Creed Bloodlines or LittleBigPlanet for PSP and to do this you have to redeem it between February 18th and March 21st
5117132	5120394	Wait, so that's like if you just buy a new PSP Go, you can get one of those games for free?
5120474	5121275	Yeah, during this time.
5122536	5125218	I guess they're trying to finally make it worth some of the money they're asking for it.
5125898	5127079	Yeah, so that's kind of cool.
5127559	5134824	And then finally, there was a contest that was being held for modders for Unreal Tournament 3.
5135905	5140428	And Epic has released the winners of the Make Something Unreal contest.
5141048	5144711	and several mod teams created a bunch of different mods for it.
5145071	5147913	The winning mod was a game called The Hunted.
5148314	5153257	It was a third-person survivor horror action game that kind of looked like a Wild West version of Left 4 Dead.
5153918	5164226	As the winner of the contest, the team will receive $50,000 and a commercial license for the Unreal Engine, meaning the team can actually make an Unreal Engine title as a commercial product.
5165386	5165507	And...
5167148	5168488	That'd be pretty awesome looking.
5169489	5171190	I watched the trailer for this and it was sweet.
5171750	5173371	Some of the other winners.
5173812	5176993	Second place was The Ball from Toltec Studios.
5178134	5180976	Third place, Angels Fall First by PlantStorm.
5182076	5183357	And it's the PlantStorm team.
5183377	5183617	They won $30,000.
5185298	5186558	Fourth place, Prometheus.
5187178	5190319	And also the Prometheus team, they won $20,000.
5190859	5196180	And it looks like fifth place won $10,000 with Hazard, A Journey of Life.
5197200	5198741	And they had some other categories as well.
5198801	5200181	Lots of money being given away, though.
5202121	5202802	That's pretty cool.
5203722	5204422	So, yeah.
5204862	5206502	Hopefully, we'll look forward to seeing that.
5208223	5210243	Alright, well I have some quick topics for you guys here.
5210423	5213784	And one of them has to do with a game that's unlikely to...
5215904	5219346	It's not one you would think is as played as it is, but what does WoW have?
5219386	5221867	World of Warcraft's got, what, 11, maybe 12 million players on it?
5223008	5223688	I think that's about right.
5223768	5226110	I think Warcraft is probably one of the biggest MMOs with that many people.
5226410	5230553	What if I told you there was a game with about seven times as many players on it playing right now?
5231293	5232354	It's FarmVille.
5232834	5233314	Yeah, that's right.
5233354	5235816	There's a news story circulating game blogs this week.
5235836	5236496	I hate that game.
5236877	5240819	FarmVille has passed 80 million users yesterday.
5240959	5242100	DarkSakura.com
5269280	5273361	Yeah, so FarmVille, of course, 80 million people playing FarmVille.
5273401	5280623	Look, whether you love or hate FarmVille, it certainly goes to show that Facebook as a gaming platform should not be discounted.
5280643	5282143	I mean, that is a huge amount of people.
5282223	5286344	No word as to how many spam messages those 80 million people have sent their friends about.
5286364	5290565	I don't know, sign up for this and get a million farm bucks or whatever it is.
5290646	5291006	I don't know.
5291126	5294727	So I can get a super cow to make lots of milk or whatever they do.
5294747	5295547	Super cow.
5295587	5296487	Super cow, whatever.
5296907	5298528	I see all this bullshit all the time.
5298829	5303672	I get all these group invites like, join me now in Farmville so I can get my honeycomb or whatever.
5303692	5304473	I hit all of those.
5304893	5305433	Oh my gosh.
5305493	5308375	No, I get like group invites to my email.
5308415	5308736	I mean, ugh.
5309576	5311197	I just report them for abuse every time.
5313737	5314678	I just get irritated.
5314718	5318022	But see, yeah, I mean, Actdeft in chatroom brings up a good point.
5318062	5320104	Bejeweled Blitz greater than Farmville.
5320645	5323408	I will admit, I still play Bejeweled Blitz, like, a lot.
5323468	5325050	Like, Alan, you watched me play the other day.
5325130	5328194	Like, I was like, oh, I gotta get my score in for the week because I want to get entered in for laptop.
5328935	5332199	And, yeah, I have Bejeweled Blitz on my phone.
5333070	5336292	Not more, I quit that too I've tried some of them
5361007	5371754	and I tried FarmVille and I finally actually told people before they had the hide, you know, all things from this application to just stop including me on their little announcements.
5372635	5376017	You know, I would hunt down people and tell them, disinclude me.
5377088	5377929	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5393585	5396988	Of course, my favorite of those groups is still I Bet This Pickle Can Get More Fans Than Nickelback.
5399190	5402752	Wasn't there one that's like I Bet This Mobius Strip Can Get More Fans Than Itself?
5405054	5406295	I saw a group called that.
5406855	5407816	Or there was another one.
5407836	5408357	I don't know.
5408397	5409658	There was one you joined this week.
5409698	5411299	Or was that just a status update, Alan?
5411319	5416103	You put like I Bet That X Can Get More Fans Than Y. I don't remember what it said.
5417203	5420106	I Bet This Atvar Can Get More Fans Than Y.
5420646	5422607	Pound Fu, like just variables.
5422788	5423448	Programming joke?
5423588	5423808	Yes.
5423868	5424168	Got it.
5424709	5426250	That's a very high-level nerd joke.
5426270	5428211	That might be too highbrow for this show, actually.
5428511	5431053	You need to tone it down with some dick and fart jokes.
5431774	5437578	Oh, hey, StarCraft II, hey, no better way to bring it to gaming than talk about StarCraft II.
5437598	5445303	Of course, as I'm sure you've heard many other places, the beta launched this week, and yeah, lots of people very eager to get in this game.
5445743	5446985	How eager are they?
5447445	5454854	So eager that they are paying up to $300 for StarCraft 2 beta keys to get into this game.
5454934	5458759	This is some of the tickets that were handed out at BlizzCon 2008, apparently.
5459900	5460822	Now they are selling for $300.
5460862	5461663	As high as $450 they've been spotted.
5461683	5461743	Wow.
5465547	5467208	I mean, don't get me wrong.
5467408	5471310	I think StarCraft 2 is going to be kind of cool, but not $450 cool.
5471350	5473171	Dude, I can wait like a month for the finished product.
5473211	5473672	Or not a month.
5473832	5474912	Three months for the finished product.
5474932	5475773	I'll wait six even.
5477952	5480595	A lot of good news at Blizzard Camp right now, though.
5480675	5489844	Blizzard also this week has announced that their Pandaren campaign, that's right, they were selling in-game pets in World of Warcraft for $10 to fundraise money for the Make-A-Wish Foundation.
5489884	5490565	Yeah, I bought one.
5490605	5490865	Shut up.
5490905	5491406	Don't judge me.
5491706	5495110	Hey, I helped contribute to a cause that overall raised, they are announcing...
5495810	5500593	1.1 million dollars was raised by the Pandaren monks.
5501234	5502995	And that was such a big donation.
5503015	5509940	It was actually reported in the OC Register, which is a pretty big newspaper in Orange County, which you may know or not know.
5509980	5511381	That's where Blizzard is headquartered.
5512081	5518045	What you also may not know about Orange County, I believe there is an art gallery there called the Orange Lounge.
5518706	5525110	If you Google Orange Lounge, I don't know if you put Orange Lounge right here, just like Orange Lounge, you get that in your results.
5525530	5528152	Just kind of a LOL what type of moment.
5528813	5535579	Anyhow, the Pandora Monks are still on sale, but you should know they are no longer going towards the Make-A-Wish Foundation.
5535999	5537801	That was just a limited time thing.
5538762	5542025	Hey, if you look up Dark Sakura on Google, you can get my DeviantArt page.
5542125	5542545	Do you really?
5542725	5543105	Yeah, you do.
5543266	5543606	Interesting.
5544736	5545556	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5574144	5574484	Yes, I do.
5574564	5575845	And by the way, I found the Orange Lounge.
5577285	5577605	Nice.
5577745	5592870	So anyway, yeah, with the stuff I have, we've got rock band releases coming from Hymn, One Night Only, The Police, and Marilyn Manson.
5594051	5599152	So the Hymn Pack is Heart Killer, Ode to Solitude, Wings of a Butterfly, which I don't give a shit about.
5599912	5600753	And then we have...
5602474	5608239	KSM, Distracted, Marilyn Manson, The Dope Show, One Night Only, Just for Tonight, and Please, Walking on the Moon.
5608899	5610321	And they're also available for Lego Rock Band.
5611201	5612482	Then we have...
5615054	5618556	Yeah, David Coverdale's kind of funny.
5619857	5626721	He's not sure if there's going to be any Whitesnake songs coming on to any of the music games.
5627481	5630183	The only one that I care about is Here I Go Again.
5630743	5632524	Because, I mean, I'm sorry, that song's just awesome.
5634525	5641109	And then Axis is bringing back the Kunio-kun series.
5642009	5642190	We...
5644488	5645289	River City Dodgeball
5668507	5670108	Yep, Super Dodgeball Brawlers.
5670148	5670589	Sweet.
5671409	5671870	So that's it.
5672891	5673191	Alright.
5673611	5675593	Let's get into some Twitter topics, folks.
5675913	5680877	We always invite your Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR and we're going to read some of your tweets.
5681417	5682098	Show us your tweets.
5683942	5684903	DarkSakura.com
5703863	5707644	for parts of like West Sacramento-ish.
5707964	5709725	I think they're really popular, but not a lot here.
5710325	5713425	And U-verse, I don't think really exists here.
5713606	5714846	Yeah, we don't have U-verse.
5714966	5721608	I looked up all of those for my new apartment because I wanted to competitively price and see who could give me the best deal, but Comcast was my only option.
5723388	5725571	But it looks like the internet's running fine now, so whatever.
5727294	5727894	Let's see.
5729336	5735685	Got a message from Alpha Cananogram that's pointing us to this news story on Joystick.
5735705	5740912	I want to make sure this isn't coming up later in the show because I didn't familiarize myself very well with the show world tonight.
5741312	5741412	Uh-oh.
5766926	5770508	Yeah, the personal reason is I gotta get off this sinking ship quick.
5771188	5772829	Hopefully things are able to turn around there.
5773369	5777692	And also another tweet to us from Actdeft saying, can someone buy me this please?
5778072	5782314	And he links us to a story on Kotaku that talks about pre-ordering the Final Fantasy XIII soundtrack.
5782334	5782834	85 tracks on 4 CDs.
5787016	5789077	You can also get that on the North American Squeenix store.
5789157	5793799	I'm sure it's going to be available through iTunes as well, but what a nice little collector's edition that would make.
5794299	5795420	So, there you go.
5797021	5797321	Nice.
5798841	5801583	I don't know, I haven't really heard a lot of the music from Final Fantasy XIII yet.
5801603	5804104	Just the Leona Lewis song, but that's because that's on her CD.
5804844	5807125	Anyway, so you can hear the little clip on iTunes.
5807165	5809566	So I haven't really heard the actual music music from the game yet.
5810507	5811167	But I did see...
5812007	5837895	of all places i saw on oh no they didn't this week which if you've never heard of oh no they didn't alan help me describe oh no they didn't you've been a member longer than i have how would you describe it it's the largest community on live journal it's so it's so large that during um major news events it'll actually crash the site for one community that's totally non-profit they don't make any um money off of it but it's just celebrity gossip and media news so it's just you know celeb lols basically yeah
5838495	5842117	And lots of great... Animated GIFs are the whole reason to be on Oh No They Didn't.
5842157	5844558	You find the best animated GIFs you're going to find anywhere on the internet there.
5844958	5852682	So anyway, Oh No They Didn't had a story about... Somebody posted the actual video on YouTube of Leona Lewis playing Final Fantasy XIII.
5853423	5856064	And it was kind of awkward to look at.
5856244	5860586	Like, you know, she's really cute and everything, but her lines sounded really fed.
5860766	5865509	Let me see if I can find that video really quick before we get to the next news story here.
5866209	5873295	Maybe I'll have Loki do a news story real quick while I try to find the video, and then I'll come back to this, because you've got to hear this, because I don't know.
5874475	5882381	As precious as Leona Lewis is, I can't really think of a good adjective to describe Leona Lewis, but precious seems to be one.
5883362	5885724	Her lines sound really forced, so I've got to try this.
5887325	5889667	By the way, AkumaJP in chat is saying, quite good.
5889967	5891108	Apparently the music is quite good.
5891388	5893090	So, chat.orangezonsradio.com
5895213	5896334	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5920655	5927078	A week after that, March 10th, we'll have Scrap Metal, which is kind of a top-down racing game.
5927259	5930840	No one will really care, though, because that's the same week as, I believe, Final Fantasy XIII.
5932061	5935603	And that's also 1,200 Microsoft points, or $15.
5936183	5945848	March 17th, there will be the Perfect Dark Xbox Live Arcade game coming out for $10, or 800 Microsoft points.
5947509	5954776	And then finally, of course, as expected, on March 24th, the Game Room Hub will be available for no charge.
5954796	5962063	Of course, the games will run on their 400 Microsoft points or $5 for a PC and Xbox 360 friendly version.
5962524	5969871	Or if you want to license them for one system, 240 Microsoft points or 40 Microsoft points for a single play.
5971129	5972690	I'm so excited about Game Room, though.
5972871	5973791	I think it's going to be fun.
5974232	5977895	And I hope there'll be people that want to have competitions on the old school games with me.
5978075	5983360	I'll buy some of them, but I'm definitely not buying all the games that I had.
5983400	5984201	Oh, definitely.
5984261	5984381	No.
5984641	5985422	And I refuse.
5985502	5988204	I will not buy a game that was already out on Xbox Live.
5988244	5990807	Although, I will ask this, because I don't see a story on this anywhere else.
5991147	5992368	And I read this earlier this week.
5992408	5996612	Did you hear about how apparently some of the Midway games have disappeared from Xbox Live completely?
5996632	5996692	Yes.
5997332	5998994	Joust, and Smash TV.
5999794	6001316	Pretty much anything that was connected to Midway.
6001396	6002717	Gauntlet, they're gone.
6002777	6003618	They're not on Xbox Live.
6003658	6004579	You cannot buy them now.
6005139	6014867	Now, they swear up and down, or at least on Major Nelson's blog, it swears nothing to do with Game Room, it's a licensing thing, and maybe that has to do with the Warner Brothers acquisition, but I don't know.
6014927	6017990	I kind of look at that and go, okay, uh-huh, sure.
6018010	6020032	I think it has to do with Midway being gone.
6020252	6024916	I think that's what it is, because now... But seriously, if Joust shows up on Game Room, aren't you going to be like...
6026334	6027975	I'm sorry, I gave a visual.
6028555	6032817	They're not going to be... I don't think that's the reason why.
6033257	6037559	First off, I can't imagine those games are really popular right now as far as purchases go.
6037579	6038800	But they're classic.
6039080	6040781	Smash TV is a classic.
6040901	6043162	I understand that, but at the same time...
6044901	6053128	I guess maybe they could be doing that, but I don't think it's going to matter because there's going to be Pac-Man and Namco games aren't going away on Xbox Live Arcade.
6053468	6054509	Konami games, I know.
6054529	6055089	Konami games.
6055149	6055550	Frogger.
6055630	6056551	We'll always have Frogger.
6057471	6059113	So I don't... Yeah, great.
6060774	6070642	So I don't doubt that... I don't think that's the reason why is that because they're putting them on that service, but we'll see.
6071761	6078346	And a good question from Actdeft in our chatroom, Joust, then what will happen with those Xbox Live 12-month game codes?
6079107	6082229	I guess they're screwed, or maybe you'll get the points instead.
6082689	6092156	Well, first off, so you know, the Xbox Live 12-month game codes that come with free games and stuff, I think they switched out those games.
6092196	6094438	Yeah, they probably switched out Joust a long time ago.
6094638	6095999	They do new versions all the time.
6096239	6101263	And the same thing, you know, they may be off the marketplace, but those codes may still redeem it.
6101623	6104925	and if you've already downloaded it and need to re-download it again, they're still up there.
6104965	6106046	So they're on their servers.
6106146	6108988	Yeah, and your game doesn't stop working just because it's gone.
6109028	6113131	Yeah, so it may not matter that those game codes are in there.
6113311	6115592	Do you know how many of those freaking games I bought?
6115632	6118774	Like I think what I want to do tomorrow is just go in when I have the internet again.
6119154	6125859	I'm going to go in and actually just play Joust and Smash TV and all those games you can't get anymore just to fill up my gamer card to go, I have them.
6130136	6133057	Alright, let's go back to something I was mentioning earlier.
6133377	6136399	This video is only a minute 13, so I'm going to go ahead and play it in studio.
6136799	6149726	This is Leona Lewis talking about Final Fantasy XIII, and this is on YouTube user Gamerspawn, although I'm guessing he probably just stole it from the official Squeenix YouTube, but this is just who I'm playing it from, so whatever.
6150667	6152868	So here it is, Leona Lewis talking about Final Fantasy XIII.
6156991	6158075	There's a little, here we go.
6160603	6161445	Really amazing.
6161847	6162910	Graphics are insane.
6173709	6177010	She just did this little, like, yes thing with her little hand, like a little fist.
6177050	6182151	Like, I don't know how many times I've been playing Final Fantasy where I went, yes, but that couldn't have looked any more forced.
6182191	6183252	I just point out.
6183612	6187633	I have to say, I have, though, thrown down my controller and gone, oh, for fuck's sake.
6187913	6188293	Exactly.
6188813	6190314	That's what I want to see Leona Lewis do.
6190334	6193535	I want to see her throw her controller out the window like, fucking monster.
6193555	6194475	That would be funny.
6203646	6204307	What do you want to bet?
6204347	6209893	Like, she might be holding the controller, but somebody else off camera is holding the real controller and playing the game.
6211395	6213437	So they can show her playing the game, quote, quote.
6215039	6215719	Amazing.
6215920	6218442	I just wanted to, like, run around the land all day.
6220204	6220985	Hi, everyone.
6221145	6225250	I'm thrilled to be collaborating with Square Enix on such a groundbreaking game.
6225751	6235953	I never would have imagined my hands as such a perfect fit for Final Fantasy XIII, but the strong female protagonist struck a chord with me, and I can't wait to see Lightning do her thing.
6235973	6246615	In anticipation of the much-awaited launch of Final Fantasy XIII, and on behalf of Square Enix, please join us in celebration of the launch of Final Fantasy XIII on March 9th.
6247655	6250875	It's like I can see her eyes reading off the cue card.
6251075	6253716	I mean, no one says protagonist, you know.
6254461	6255803	I wanna run around the field!
6256844	6257986	I see something sparkly!
6269654	6272296	In defense of that... Ah, Butterfly!
6272556	6273317	Oh my god!
6273357	6278880	In defense of the running around all day thing, I have been doing a lot of that in Star Trek Online just to see, oh, I wonder if this planet's here.
6278940	6280001	Oh, I wonder if this planet's here.
6280021	6280962	But that's an MMO.
6281942	6287486	The funny thing is, Final Fantasy XIII's kind of been getting a little slack for how linear it is.
6287746	6294851	I've heard it's kind of like, you don't have towns and the dungeons are not... It's a little more linear, although I've heard good things about the game.
6294891	6295972	It's just a little different.
6296032	6298774	It's just funny to hear her say, I could just run around all day.
6299754	6300115	Do that.
6300335	6302498	I can just run around all day because that's all I know how to do.
6302518	6310750	I can run around all day long and annoy the fuck out of my significant other who's watching me play this game and go, What the fuck are you doing, woman? !
6315400	6342030	I was gonna say it's the only way really one of her singles is gonna sell 2 million copies here is that she attaches it to that video game well no because then all the stuck up people are gonna be like oh well the Japanese version's better cause you know everything you know who actually had I think to this date had the best Final Fantasy song ever and that's Angela Aki I'm sorry that hers was such a crap game but Kiss Me Goodbye was a great song and
6342350	6343292	and it launched her career.
6344054	6345116	That was 9, right?
6345597	6345798	Yes.
6346178	6348022	But I don't think 9 was a crap game.
6348062	6349285	It was one of the better PlayStation.
6349586	6350087	It was better than 8.
6351969	6362159	The thing about 9 is it just kind of like, if I remember right, you know, this is many years ago, but if I remember right, 9 just kind of showed up, like, just out of nowhere, like, hey, Final Fantasy 9's out.
6362239	6363079	Like, oh, wow.
6363160	6366803	And then it was like, hey, fanservice, fanservice, and then, hey, the PS2's out now.
6367304	6369726	Like, it was kind of the same thing that happened with Final Fantasy 12.
6369926	6372388	It was like, hey, here's Final Fantasy 12 finally.
6372609	6374491	Oh, but the Xbox 360 and PS3 are out now.
6374711	6374891	Darn.
6375231	6382878	Well, I meant, and I'm not saying it was a bad game, I'm not saying, a crap game was more like, I lost interest in it.
6383378	6386441	Like, I got to the, I got on the airship and I was done.
6387362	6388603	You know, when you first escape.
6389684	6391386	But, it had the best song.
6392798	6397160	SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom saying looking at the video she is using the player one controller.
6397200	6398861	Yeah, but see if they're smart.
6398921	6403723	If they're really smart they have another system that it's synced to and then they have the other controller synced to the other one.
6404343	6405144	Yeah.
6405264	6406084	They thought ahead, huh?
6406104	6406745	Oh, come on.
6406965	6407865	That's how I would do it.
6407945	6409706	An idiot could play a Final Fantasy game.
6410353	6415437	And after all, she did say that she liked running around the field, so maybe they just put her down.
6415457	6417919	Well, she was just running around the field.
6418239	6419580	Okay, look, I like Leona Lewis.
6419600	6420300	She's precious.
6420400	6423823	Why are these animals attacking me while I'm running around the field?
6424123	6425424	Why are we picking on Leona Lewis?
6425464	6426185	She's defenseless.
6426965	6429988	It's like we're kicking Bambi, like making fun of Leona Lewis.
6430168	6432750	We're not making fun of Leona Lewis, we're making fun of how forced that video was.
6436212	6438234	I don't mind the Final Fantasy XIII song.
6438374	6445338	I think the trailer is kind of weird with all the stuff blowing up and it's like, My hands!
6445378	6447540	You know, like explosions and motorcycles.
6448401	6449481	My hands!
6449701	6452583	You know, it's like, it doesn't really fit.
6452784	6456046	I can put that song then as my battle music in Final Fantasy XIV.
6456146	6457907	There you go.
6460149	6461570	When you're attacking a level 75 bunny.
6464691	6465692	Crushing your neck.
6466553	6467654	My hands.
6467914	6468895	Ripping your head off.
6473378	6474880	I don't like doing falsetto on the show.
6474940	6478923	Hey, let's talk about iTunes and the iPhone.
6478983	6484047	Because, of course, the iPhone, whether Loki likes it or not, is another gaming platform.
6484207	6484908	And apparently...
6487651	6487851	What?
6487951	6488272	Never mind.
6488632	6488852	Oh, okay.
6489212	6494076	Apparently there's this game out on the iPhone that folks are getting a little crazy about.
6494457	6497059	And it's Wobble Eyeboobs.
6497940	6503184	This program got... Use your imagination, folks.
6503564	6505806	$30,000 is how much this game made last year.
6506126	6510850	But it was now being removed because people were complaining about the sexual content.
6511551	6512131	Apparently...
6513152	6516375	Some of the rules that were given as to what is not supposed to be in your app.
6516875	6518496	No images of women in bikinis.
6519317	6520678	No images of men in bikinis.
6521318	6522199	No skin.
6523440	6527343	No silhouettes that indicate that wobble can be used for wobbling boobs.
6528183	6530445	No sexual connotations or innuendo.
6530505	6532006	Boobs, babes, booty, sex.
6532606	6534368	Nothing that can be sexually arousing.
6534848	6538271	And no apps will be approved that in any way imply sexual content.
6538951	6545716	By the way, the guy asked, since no skin is cited as the reason this app was pulled, he asked if a burqa was okay.
6545956	6548058	But the Apple guy apparently got angry at that.
6551621	6552001	I don't know.
6552061	6554843	Do you think Apple has a right to be removing these ads?
6554903	6555624	It's gone.
6555644	6555824	Huh?
6556144	6556564	It's gone.
6557245	6557925	Oh yeah, it's gone.
6558146	6560107	Do you think Apple has a right to be taking this stuff down?
6560267	6564690	I think they have a right, but I think at the same time they should offer this kind of content.
6564851	6566552	I mean, just maybe locked somehow.
6568308	6570009	We can download a song called Boobs.
6570589	6574952	And aren't there apps about farting and peeing and pooping and all this stuff?
6574972	6575392	That's not nudity.
6576013	6577974	I'm sure there's apps about blowing people up.
6579235	6583958	Well, unless you're gonna go in your pants, pooping does involve nudity at some point.
6584518	6588541	You can rip people's eyes out, but goddammit, if a boob shakes...
6590259	6591159	It's over for you.
6612208	6620490	So for example, in a game like God of War that has lots of bloody violence, there should be some really erotic game that they put out with no violence in it.
6621511	6621991	It's only fair.
6622191	6626292	Just make it prove that you're 18 in order to download the content.
6626312	6627452	Doesn't it kind of already do that?
6627572	6632073	I seem to remember downloading some content and it'll say, this might be objectionable.
6632113	6637815	I think the keyboard cat app that I have, which will play keyboard cat at the touch of a button, it's amazing.
6638535	6643798	actually says this might contain mature content and you have to be 17 or older to continue.
6644678	6645759	It's keyboard cat.
6646239	6649541	I know, but... I think that cats playing keyboard is offensive.
6651922	6653402	It's cruelty to keyboards.
6654323	6655503	What about dogs playing keyboards?
6655783	6656364	I don't give a shit.
6657324	6657764	Just curious.
6657784	6658645	They should play the bassoon.
6660678	6660918	What?
6661259	6662720	I just said the bassoon for some reason.
6662940	6663481	I don't know.
6663901	6665262	Where did the bassoon come from?
6665342	6667584	I think I mentioned the bassoon quartet earlier.
6667604	6669085	You're in a bassoon mood.
6669145	6670006	I see.
6670346	6672068	Rolf the dog played keyboard before anyone.
6673909	6674270	Sorry.
6675771	6677032	Freaking keyboard cat app.
6677913	6678853	Now I have to download it.
6678954	6680395	I've got to bring it back to Muppets.
6680435	6682857	Rolf the dog is before keyboard cat.
6685959	6686760	Can I do a story?
6686860	6687140	Yes.
6688579	6694381	Speaking of iPhone and violence, um, yeah, Street Fighter 4 is going to be coming on the iPhone, and I'm like, why?
6695122	6695422	Really?
6695922	6696242	Why?
6697182	6702144	So far, all we see is Ken and Ryu, um, nothing really in action.
6702204	6704865	They look kind of, um, dinky and tiny.
6705866	6711408	I wasn't aware that the iPhone had a big 3D processor in it or anything.
6712408	6712629	So...
6714109	6714449	Whatever.
6715190	6722532	But, in happier news for those of us who will play Super Street Fighter 4, we get some Street Fighter 3 characters.
6722612	6730815	We get Ibuki, we get Makoto, and we get Dudley, as we mentioned in rumor of the week before.
6731735	6733076	So, that's pretty cool.
6733636	6736297	And there's also this cake box.
6736317	6743800	I was looking at the Japanese... I'm sure you saw what my wallpaper was of Sakura, but it was the Super Street Fighter 4 website.
6744260	6751822	There's also this Korean taekwondo fighter who's just vicious.
6752663	6753383	Absolutely vicious.
6753803	6757024	They show this character beating up Sagat, and they never show anyone beating up Sagat.
6757084	6758525	So, pretty crazy.
6760420	6762521	I didn't play a lot of Street Fighter 3, admittedly.
6762641	6764682	Are these good characters to be bringing over?
6765243	6767764	Ibuki was my staple for Street Fighter 3.
6768864	6769144	Same.
6769965	6770905	She's fast.
6771145	6774207	Although, you know who I actually would have really liked to have seen was Elena.
6775157	6776298	I think Elena was the one I used.
6776318	6778439	She's the one that kind of did like capoeira type moves, right?
6778479	6778719	Yeah.
6778859	6779879	I used her when I played.
6779899	6780660	She was all leg.
6781260	6782081	Ah, very cool.
6782121	6784502	Kind of like Eddie in Tekken 4, right?
6784662	6785282	Or 3, 4, one of the two?
6785302	6785282	3.
6785462	6785662	Ah.
6786623	6788204	Because after that they got Christy.
6789484	6791385	So Street Fighter 4 on the iPhone, huh?
6792366	6794186	They're talking about pouring it to the PSP also.
6795427	6799609	I can see the PSP better than I can see the buttons.
6800229	6811395	Well, the screen capture, this image that they had of it was like the joystick and everything was on the screen.
6811995	6814116	So are you going to actually be able to see what you're doing?
6814516	6814776	No.
6817038	6817778	It's a bad idea.
6818178	6820099	They're going to make money off of it, but it's a bad idea.
6820839	6823141	Well, you know what I think about Street Fighter 4 coming to the iPhone?
6823561	6823881	Your mom?
6832740	6834421	Actually, no, that's the Muppet Babies theme.
6834441	6838442	I just had it stuck in my head ever since Alan mentioned Rolf.
6840963	6842163	Let's jam to this a little bit.
6843084	6846925	Because it's going to be better than Street Fighter 4 on the iPhone, let's face it.
6857418	6859479	Oh yeah, no, I don't care about Street Fighter 4 on the iPhone.
6859499	6860619	It's going to control like shit.
6860799	6864400	Until Apple releases an actual joystick for the iPhone, who cares?
6865100	6866560	But I would download a Muppet Babies app.
6866660	6866940	I would.
6867760	6870081	Well, maybe you might be more interested in Fable 3.
6870901	6873942	Fable 3, they're talking a little bit about the co-op in the game.
6874562	6878143	And it sounds to me, even though they're claiming it's all new and stuff,
6878983	6892216	It sounds just like Fable 2 if you ask me, but according to an interview with Peter Molino during the 4Guys1UP podcast, they talked about the co-op system.
6892336	6899823	Basically, if you go into someone else's game, you'll take your player, your player's dog,
6900503	6902545	The weapons that you've crafted as well.
6903426	6907249	All the unique stuff that you've made will be in the game.
6907329	6911372	Also, if you don't want to be tied into the person's camera, you could go off and do your own thing.
6911772	6919098	But of course, just like the second game, you want to be careful of who you invite in your game because someone may come in and rape all your women.
6919599	6922341	Just like, you know... I hate it when that happens.
6922521	6923382	Yes, exactly.
6923442	6923642	Yeah.
6924303	6924483	Yeah.
6926357	6929383	or hits on the shopkeeper and then they stop working.
6929423	6932809	I hate it when I leave my house and I come back and all the women got raped while I was gone.
6933531	6934913	What a downer to your day.
6935675	6935855	Yes.
6936436	6936657	So...
6939617	6942378	Fable 2 and Fable 3 probably not that much different from each other.
6967927	6968387	What a shock.
6968688	6977875	Despite all this hype, you know, much like the hype from Fable 1 to Fable 2, don't be surprised if they're very similar.
6978456	6981498	Well, if I get to bring all this stuff into the game, can I bring Shermie into my game?
6981719	6982419	That's what I want to do.
6983580	6984341	What would she do?
6985101	6985422	Poop?
6985642	6986923	Not be able to run and catch up.
6987203	6990346	No, she'd find a towel that was laying around in your game and piss on it.
6991227	6992708	Which is what she's been doing lately.
6993989	6995050	Fuck you to my cat.
6996192	6996292	No. 120.
7023688	7025129	Yeah, 90 minutes for the average player.
7025169	7029692	Apparently it's the entire first dungeon of the game and two bosses from the game.
7029852	7034495	So that's coming out on February 25th for the game Darksiders.
7035996	7040519	I guess they just wanted to see, wanted to really give you a whole in-depth look at the game.
7041313	7042654	It seems like, why not?
7043194	7048716	If a game is going to take 50 hours to complete, what's with giving away an hour and a half for free?
7048736	7052918	They could have given away an hour and a half demo for Oblivion and people would still buy it.
7052978	7053898	I think that's a good idea.
7053938	7054759	Get people hooked.
7055039	7057700	Games like Saints Row where they had a half an hour demo.
7057780	7059681	I played that demo like 80 times.
7059741	7060281	It was awesome.
7060981	7062362	Get people hooked and then there you go.
7062482	7063562	Kill time until the game came out.
7065755	7067357	DarkSakura is going to dive into the mailbag.
7080515	7083257	at Mailbag at OrangeLauncher.com and read some emails right now.
7099586	7101049	about the general gaming populace.
7101529	7104093	They have no fucking clue what the average gamer wants.
7104274	7111024	This guy needs to shut his mouth and also the iPad is a disgrace and I wish it would be the downfall of Apple Go Microsoft.
7111324	7111985	Um, whatever.
7113610	7115872	Now this is a little... Can I respond to that real quick?
7115933	7118335	Like, dude, you're welcome to your opinion and all that fun stuff.
7118375	7118836	But you're wrong.
7119156	7127484	But, like, okay, even if the iPad fails, Apple still has ginormous business as a phone company.
7128546	7129987	I know that's not what they started as.
7130047	7133130	They started with those little green monitors that were in all of our grade school classrooms.
7134191	7138753	but they're a huge phone company now and yet computers and all that stuff too but the phone thing is huge.
7138773	7143816	The Mac is still the standard of the graphic design industry.
7145016	7149118	But yeah, I do remember Loki going off on that one show that was kind of funny and yeah, he had a point.
7150319	7151299	I'll meet you halfway there.
7152260	7153961	Now for the long ass email of the night.
7154181	7154481	Yay!
7156024	7156805	Hi, LLR.
7156885	7166635	I'm not sure how much help this email will be, but I was listening to your last two podcasts and wanted to know what it would take to get the video game development companies to be unionized.
7167075	7169538	I'm definitely no expert, but I work for a local in Chicago.
7170619	7176145	Although I have no say in the local's decisions or anything, I've been with them for a while now, and I've seen how things are done.
7176265	7178507	I also work closely with one of the largest unions in the U.S.
7178607	7179368	I'm not an employee.
7179668	7180128	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7203608	7209933	AFSCME, AFL-CIO, and SCIU are one of the biggest unions, SCIU dealing with USA, Canada, and Puerto Rico.
7210613	7219260	One of the ladies at work said that the video game industry would probably fall under the entertainment category, which would mean that all of the unions that AFL-CIO is the one to contact.
7219620	7222542	What they need to do is contact their closest AFL-CIO branch.
7222682	7226825	It all depends, although, because I don't know which video game company you had in mind.
7227165	7232469	If you were thinking EA, where a friend of mine works, they would need to contact the Sacramento office or maybe San Francisco.
7232489	7233290	I honestly can't remember.
7233330	7233950	I didn't take notes.
7234390	7234971	And there's a link.
7235451	7240415	It's actually aflcio.org slash joinayunion slash how slash howto.cfm
7242597	7245139	Now you can end my email here, but I'd like to voice my opinion on this.
7246460	7252885	Unionizing video game workers is probably supported by most gamers who feel they should have fair work hours, pay, and everything else.
7253005	7263654	However, say there's a strike at Square Enix and it prevented the release of the newest Final Fantasy game or strike at Capcom that's keeping the newest crossover fighting game from coming out.
7264214	7266155	Will gamers still support the striking workers?
7266896	7268798	Who will gamers choose the product to the workers?
7268898	7271540	I honestly don't know what I'd want more to be honest.
7272460	7275481	Remember the writer's strike that prevented new episodes of TV shows from premiering?
7275981	7279782	Were you reading for the writers or were you craving more episodes of Lost or Ugly Betty?
7280843	7281883	This is my insertment.
7282383	7283003	I didn't care.
7285044	7285664	I don't really watch TV.
7285764	7291286	I know you don't watch a lot of TV, but look, from the standpoint of somebody who was like, I think the writer's strike kind of ruined Heroes.
7292266	7295887	Well, the second season was already kind of poopy, but I don't know.
7296067	7299128	The writer's strike really damned some shows that were on a roll.
7299828	7302770	I see the point the email is trying to make.
7303170	7306172	It's a great point and one I didn't consider last week.
7306572	7308233	That's why I'm glad we got emails on it.
7308273	7313296	But if companies also want to keep their product going, they need to have a quality work environment for the people that are working for them.
7313716	7314757	You have to respect the worker.
7316353	7325583	To continue, I remember in high school after I graduated that teachers were striking for whatever reason, maybe pay, and they kept school from starting on time, which meant the end of the school year was that much later.
7325703	7330929	The students were not happy and wanted the striking to end, not for the teacher's sake, but for their early release.
7332014	7332274	Who knows?
7332334	7337219	I probably didn't want to be on the teacher's side because teachers aren't usually students' best friend.
7337319	7337699	Who knows?
7338299	7341362	So yeah, I wouldn't know what I'd go for.
7341462	7348328	If you support the workers, then be really sure you still support them, even at the cost of the release date of a game you're really looking forward to.
7348808	7349089	Stan.
7349189	7351951	Rob, it was nice meeting you when you came to ASEN.
7352011	7352852	I know I was kind of boring.
7353132	7353833	Oh, okay, okay.
7353893	7354533	I know who this is.
7354773	7357155	Well, that was a great email and brought up some points.
7357215	7366181	And I don't know if you had told me you worked for a union, but that's really neat to kind of see that side of it and kind of brought up some things I didn't think about.
7366221	7368542	Like, especially, yeah, what would happen if they go on strike?
7368983	7371144	You know, we hear all these reports about conditions.
7371184	7372725	And again, I want to make this clear.
7373005	7376428	I wasn't necessarily, like, supporting saying they should unionize.
7376788	7378729	I was just kind of asking the question, what about?
7378849	7380651	Like, is it a feasible option?
7380731	7381351	Question mark.
7381491	7381891	I don't know.
7382372	7382632	You know?
7384013	7389675	The only way anything's going to change is if something is done.
7389955	7393157	So I was just suggesting maybe Union is that something, maybe.
7394117	7397058	And it's kind of neat to get that email and think about that perspective.
7397699	7401240	If that were to happen, strikes would be a very real possibility.
7401380	7407283	And people already bitch and complain when games are delayed, even if the game is being delayed for quality reasons.
7407423	7408744	Yeah, a lot of people have been...
7409424	7411206	I don't know, I would like to think me personally
7425146	7440300	I'm okay with the game being delayed as long as they're going to put out a quality product at the end like I was really looking forward to Blur that was supposed to come out fourth quarter last year but they delayed it to this year because they wanted to make sure online wasn't fucked and I'm okay with that I would rather they fix it than put out a crap game oh I agree I agree with that
7442142	7446485	There actually is one more email about the unions.
7447686	7451689	Hey OLR, I know we've been on this topic for three weeks now, so I will keep it short.
7452230	7458935	The problem with unionizing game developers is that unions cost extra money that game publishers are just not going to be willing to pay for.
7459195	7461157	They'll just hire non-unionized employees.
7461677	7469924	Lord knows that there are enough people desperate to get into the industry by any means possible that they will work god-awful hours thinking they're the next best game developer since Miyamoto.
7470604	7474908	Basically, as long as there are people to take advantage of, this will probably never stop.
7475048	7480994	Unfortunately, it doesn't leave much room for people with families who don't want to or simply can't work 12-hour days seven days a week.
7481694	7489201	These people get suckered in by company lies when they say they're getting hired for the job, saying that crunch periods will only happen on a necessity basis.
7489962	7493545	The crunch period slowly becomes perpetual, and if they don't crunch, they get fired.
7494426	7494626	etc.
7494706	7494866	etc.
7494926	7495007	etc.
7495027	7495087	etc.
7518966	7520347	Hopefully I kept that brief enough.
7520447	7534615	As a programmer myself, I count my blessings for being employed by a company that lets us go home at 7pm, though plenty of us stay later willingly, and doesn't make us work weekends, and I think it's outrageous that there are situations like this right in my backyard since I work in Silicon Valley.
7535035	7536316	Yours truly, AZHP
7537748	7544035	Well, I wish we could name – I completely understand why you don't want to say who you work for on a delicate subject like this, so please.
7544635	7555787	But I wish we could recognize whatever company that is and go, yay, and pat them on the back for having kind of a good employee policy like that.
7557888	7565972	Maybe that's what it's going to take is negative press for these companies like EA and whatever else we've heard about with the nightmare hours to curb it.
7566012	7567613	Bad press is never really a good thing.
7568373	7568753	I don't know.
7568893	7569874	It's not an easy issue.
7569934	7573355	I think this second emailer makes a really good point about the whole...
7574876	7576117	You get to test Barbie soccer!
7598439	7604546	I'll look at it, because I like reality TV, and I like video games, and I like House Sparks.
7605087	7609431	So you would think I'm all about something like the tester, but I know I'm not going to like it.
7610112	7610813	I just know it.
7612802	7616564	But something like that kind of glamorizes what might not actually be that glamorous.
7616604	7620206	It's just a little hard watching a show that's basically a commercial shoved down your throat.
7620506	7621066	Did you watch it?
7621806	7624068	No, but I can guess what it's gonna be.
7624448	7626029	A giant commercial shoved down my throat.
7626469	7626949	Oh, look it!
7627089	7628390	Let's test God of War 3!
7629150	7631771	Oh my goodness, it's so epic and wonderful.
7632052	7633552	But look at all these bugs!
7633932	7634813	No, it's not gonna be like that.
7634873	7638955	All it's gonna be is them stupid challenges that are game-related...
7639315	7665357	and then they get to talk about how awesome it was to get to play God of War 3 before anybody else you know what would make me watch the tester is if RuPaul was the judge you know and that at the end of every episode remember don't fuck it up it's time for you to lip sync for your life seriously if you've never watched Drag Race it's like the best reality show on right now well can I read the last email?
7665658	7665918	of course
7666630	7668852	Dear OLR, I have a pair of questions for Loki.
7669492	7678500	If I buy a banned modded 360 console and play a game with a patch, can I download the patch and will the patch prevent me from playing a burned game?
7678940	7681182	I wholly understand if you refuse to answer this question.
7681262	7682483	Stay care, Redertainment.
7683744	7684184	Repeat that.
7686486	7687567	A banned modded 360.
7687947	7688247	Okay.
7690529	7692431	And has a game that a patch is released for it.
7692971	7696274	Can you download the patch and will the patch prevent you from playing the burned game?
7698384	7702730	No, the patch will not prevent you from playing the Burned game, but you're not going to be able to connect to live to download the patch.
7703311	7708858	So you would have to download the patch by some other means and then transfer it to your hard drive.
7709398	7711681	And then, yes, you would be able to do that.
7713804	7714245	It's over!
7715788	7719451	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us emails.
7719771	7721933	I think that's the way DarkSakura should end the mailbag every week.
7721993	7722453	It's over!
7722733	7728357	There is actually a website, though, that does carry all of the game patches that are out there for Xbox 360.
7729338	7731820	And you can download them all individually and search by title.
7732280	7734182	Unfortunately, I do not remember what that website is.
7734522	7737784	But I know that if you do a search on Google, you'll probably be able to find it.
7737804	7739145	Because I've seen it a few times.
7740126	7744089	But that would be the way to do it if you're going to bother patching the game.
7745600	7746800	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7764147	7764908	Yay!
7764988	7765728	Naughty Games!
7765788	7766569	Bubble Bath Babes 2?
7767289	7767769	Not quite.
7767789	7769370	This is actually... Miss World Nude 2010?
7769871	7772272	This doesn't even really have a game involved with it.
7773033	7779457	I mean, they're just... It's basically, if Ubisoft were to release this today, it would be probably called My Masturbation Coach.
7780117	7781818	Press A, C, Tits?
7782158	7783179	Is that the name of the game?
7783639	7790822	No, it's basically a game that tracks your masturbation and whatnot.
7791703	7795424	Wait, is this like instead of like MyFitnessCoach or WeFit?
7795464	7796104	Exactly.
7796304	7799726	It tracks your... Masturbation.
7800446	7801006	For example...
7805708	7807089	Do you have to enter it in manually?
7808929	7809289	Funny.
7810649	7817171	Anyways, the game is from the game developer Waffle, which they win right there because their name is Waffle.
7817611	7819171	I can't compete with that.
7819271	7823252	The Eero title looks... Let me butcher this real quick here.
7823972	7831754	It looks like Migeti Ga Toma Ranai Boku 2
7832914	7833855	Oh, I'm not even going to bother.
7833875	7836257	Are we talking like a Belgian waffle or like an Eggo?
7837037	7837778	It's just waffle.
7838579	7839599	Waffle, waffle, waffle.
7839920	7840320	Anyways.
7844423	7845664	That's going to be in a song someday.
7845684	7846244	I know that.
7846304	7848866	That's the code name of the game right there.
7848886	7849387	Waffle, waffle.
7849427	7854731	Anyways, so the game records important events or everyday events.
7855171	7858734	For example, today's play style, Socks Masturbation.
7858814	7860615	Yes, they give you inspirational...
7862277	7863638	methods of masturbation.
7865279	7867681	For example, number of times you've wanked today.
7867961	7870163	Total number of times wanked so far.
7870683	7874066	There is a graphical chart that has it all.
7874486	7878349	Time taken for ejaculation and average time taken for ejaculating.
7878409	7880130	Is it animation with little dead sperm?
7881131	7883252	They've got cute anime girls that are in there.
7883653	7885274	But it gets better.
7886195	7890258	And then of course they have a wonderful database where you can organize and track information.
7890999	7893061	Total time spent wanking so far.
7893642	7895865	Total number of ejaculations so far.
7896986	7900992	And then, of course, oh, this is even better.
7901312	7907741	And then they list innovative methods of masturbation you might have never thought about.
7909242	7917249	including, in the diagram here, it looks like that stuff cut out of foam and then someone has foam pieces in the tube.
7917389	7917729	I don't know.
7918169	7924354	Anyways, but then, of course, the game is sold with a pocket pussy as well.
7924594	7927577	I thought you just used the Wii Fitness board.
7927997	7928617	The Tenga...
7929358	7931939	The Tenga Egg Wavy is what it's called.
7932079	7934159	I thought that's what the resistance strap was for.
7935300	7936760	Ripped for your pleasure.
7936860	7942882	The cover, I mean, it's just topless anime chicks all wet and thriving around.
7944162	7946983	There is no way you would not know what this game is about.
7948423	7948783	Waffle!
7948924	7949124	Waffle!
7949204	7949884	You can do this!
7968399	7975525	So you should be able to do the same thing here and show total lost productivity time to masturbation in the world.
7975545	7980709	I would imagine that the pedometer could probably be used in slimmer fashion for this device.
7982030	7984392	Not going to see this on DSiWare, unfortunately.
7986428	7987029	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8007108	8007689	I'm watching it.
8008809	8010230	And it's funny.
8010351	8017156	It's basically because Travis in the game, the way he saves is by taking a dump in a toilet.
8017656	8019357	And that's the animation that they show.
8019838	8027063	Well, this chick that's in the game, she's actually taking a shower.
8027183	8030886	Well, the glitch is that somehow she ends up in the middle... Ew, she goes in the shower?
8030966	8033148	No, she does not take a dump in the shower.
8034048	8034529	Shinobu...
8038433	8039314	I'll give you a moment.
8039994	8041895	Well, she's fake naked.
8042315	8044617	Yeah, it's Sims naked type of stuff.
8046538	8050920	But still, the thing is that she does not have clothes on and they cannot patch that out.
8051681	8052281	Go Nintendo.
8055563	8059565	No word on how exactly to recreate the glitch, but it is on YouTube for those who want to check it out.
8061186	8063187	Rob is having a real life segfault right now.
8063547	8064248	It's pretty amazing.
8065351	8066212	I'm gonna go drop a save
8086161	8093624	and SSJ100 Matt threw out the requisite tub girl question mark in our chat.
8096285	8097325	No, it's not tub girl.
8097445	8097826	Meh.
8099666	8100006	All right.
8100327	8101447	Oh, my stomach hurts.
8102187	8102567	Please.
8102868	8106669	Yeah, we need to do the FUs of the week now because I hurt from laughing.
8122362	8130445	F you to a bunch of little tiny minor things adding up to put me in the single worst mood I have ever been in in ages.
8130565	8131205	Rob, breathe.
8131425	8131785	Breathe.
8131945	8132506	I'm trying.
8132586	8134606	I don't know why it's so funny.
8134926	8135947	Okay, I'm okay.
8135967	8136267	I'm okay.
8137423	8137883	and DarkSakura.com
8167675	8167936	See?
8169558	8169718	Aww.
8170199	8171280	Ew, you can kind of see that.
8171300	8172862	Yeah, I'm going to take a picture of it and put it up online.
8173082	8174785	Because I'm that kind of exhibitionist.
8175766	8177268	Who wants to see my big bump?
8182355	8184636	Careful Waffle Entertainment might put that in their next game.
8185197	8187939	Loki.
8189720	8190380	I hate coughing.
8191000	8192341	It's tough.
8194403	8194743	I don't know.
8194783	8195823	I'm not super angsty.
8195984	8199706	F you to that not funny image that made me not stop laughing.
8200586	8206987	FU to just moves taking me like three weeks to accomplish moving.
8207087	8211748	Although everything was really smooth with the big furniture today, I still have so much stuff to clean.
8211808	8212688	So FU to cleaning.
8213829	8214429	Grr.
8215249	8218770	Alan, do you have any FUs of the week you'd like to share with our audience?
8219150	8225271	FU to having to job search for Super Serious rather than just casually having to find another job.
8227199	8230486	Do you want to try sharing some of your talents in case anyone's looking to hire somebody?
8230506	8233232	You can always get a job as a video game tester.
8233854	8234194	Oh, yeah.
8235637	8236479	Yes, he's breathing.
8236820	8237762	I think he qualifies.
8239631	8240512	So, all right.
8241072	8245035	Let's go ahead and let me do another story for you guys here from one more story.
8245055	8249358	And then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8249538	8251819	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8251879	8255522	But we do have one more story, and it's about a new video game movie in the works.
8256102	8256682	And that movie...
8257643	8258404	Missile Command.
8259024	8259885	Yes, that's right.
8259985	8263007	Missile Command apparently is being made into a movie.
8263767	8264668	At least, well, I don't know.
8264688	8269011	A lot of things they say are going to get made into a movie but don't really, but this is the latest one.
8269171	8272213	It's got more of a plot than Monopoly, the movie.
8272393	8274735	And Clue and all this stuff, right, they were talking about previously?
8274855	8276036	They should not remake Clue.
8276076	8277357	Clue was awesome the first time.
8277614	8289322	Well apparently it's coming from the Los Angeles Times that Atari is trying to sell a Missile Command film to a movie production company to get the Missile Command movie made.
8289422	8291723	I don't know what it would be about, but whatever.
8291804	8294125	It's got to be better than Armageddon was.
8295906	8298488	No word if Yars' Revenge might become a movie.
8298568	8299008	Who knows?
8299429	8301370	What kind of movie would you make out of Missile Command?
8303673	8306517	No word either if Mr. Awesome is going to be in the movie or not.
8307057	8307357	What's that?
8307778	8308359	A crappy one?
8308979	8309340	I don't know.
8310921	8311362	I don't know.
8311402	8311742	Whatever.
8312764	8313665	It's not showing up.
8313685	8314606	That came up in chat.
8314866	8316948	Two people asked, is Mr. Awesome the star?
8317589	8323616	Going back to some years old topics from All Games Radio, the network that we are on.
8324196	8325998	Let's get to the Skype line and quickly.
8326018	8330701	1-877-GAME-OLR If you'd like to give us a call right now, Skype line is open for business.
8330761	8335164	Or you can give us a call at username OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.
8335204	8336565	We'll get to your calls in just a moment.
8336605	8340928	While we wait for those calls to come in, because there's always a little bit of a delay, we'll get to some last minute stories.
8341069	8341289	Loki.
8341889	8350874	Yes, the new expansion for Resident Evil 5, also featured in the Gold Edition, has an Easter egg where you can actually unlock the classic camera.
8351075	8352215	You already talked about that, didn't you?
8352415	8354617	No, that was one of my stories that you didn't put in there.
8355817	8356158	Thank you.
8356438	8356718	Sorry.
8358379	8361281	You wanted to talk about that, but... Sorry.
8361601	8362581	Well, how about something else?
8362721	8363242	I've got one.
8364562	8368685	On the ESRB site, Q's working on a PixelJunk racer's second lap.
8370086	8370446	There you go.
8373334	8374596	Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio, who's this?
8374616	8377300	I just want to know Legend of Zaku Legend of Zaku, what's on your mind?
8389509	8393231	Nothing much, just recovering from another dull and lackluster weekend.
8396333	8418347	I don't know if you've probably heard about this story that was hitting up the rounds on Slashdot and I think Kotaku recently about a company, about a video game developer who had operations in Australia and apparently, since for some reason or another were trying to pull out of that country, but before they did, they actually snuck into the Australian offices and
8419345	8421246	They're developers that they had down there.
8421306	8426208	They snuck in and they actually took the code.
8426228	8428669	They took the IP from them.
8429809	8430929	Well, you know what I think about that?
8436271	8436452	What?
8439453	8439973	Well, I don't know.
8439993	8440493	What do you think?
8440553	8441673	Is this justice?
8441693	8444274	Do they have a right to go in and steal the code that they made or no?
8444515	8446935	Well, I mean, the whole situation is in a gray area.
8446975	8448336	I mean, you have on one hand
8449539	8458890	According to that company, which is Interzone, they said that because they use a third-party HR firm, they basically...
8460675	8469639	Basically, they're shifting the blame on them because they screwed up all the paperwork, the legal paperwork with the Australian tax offices.
8470820	8479764	And especially, they're also blaming that country for not giving them the incentives that they were owed for actually setting up operations there.
8480825	8487488	And then you see the developers with their other side of the story where they were overworked and to the point where
8488191	8489591	They didn't even get paid at all.
8489651	8491552	They were literally working without a paycheck.
8493613	8509378	Which, I mean, this is one of those unfortunate tales of the video game industry where you have a developer that tries to cut corners even though he's trying to make a quick dollar by trying to
8518488	8520368	Zaku, do you wear a hard hat when you call on the show?
8521169	8521609	Not really.
8521769	8522369	Oh, I was just curious.
8523270	8534254	Well, you know, if they're working for this company, though, and the company is paying them to do a job, and the job is to write code for this game... Okay, okay.
8534274	8539136	The reason why Rob was making banging noises is because that's what it sounds like when you type.
8540199	8545247	Well, it's not my fault that the microphone is so close to the webcam on my MacBook, alright?
8545867	8550274	I'm just saying, that's why Rob was making the noises and asking about the hard hat.
8550354	8551916	I can't type fluently.
8551957	8552838	I'm more of a pecker.
8553058	8554060	Anyways, that's what we're saying.
8554080	8556043	Wait, did you just say you're a pecker?
8557324	8559565	I just... Alright, let's grow.
8559645	8560065	Never!
8560946	8564167	You know, we give our favorite people the hardest time.
8564227	8564448	I know.
8564588	8577655	Look, in all seriousness, to answer the question, or respond to, I guess, the story about it, is that, you know, there's a certain kind of, like, yay hero to the story about them going in and stealing this code because the developers are screwing them over.
8577975	8584120	But the bottom line is, you know, they are signing the checks and paying them to write code for this game.
8584220	8588684	And if, you know, it doesn't work out, it's still owned by the people who signed those paychecks.
8588744	8589604	I understand that.
8589704	8601934	But when you actually go for months without paying your employee and just try to shift blame, you know, not make any any valiant effort to rectify the situation that I mean, the onus falls on that company.
8602315	8604516	Well, is this an American company?
8605017	8605978	Is this an American company?
8606838	8612042	It's basically an American company which supposedly has a studio in Australia.
8612662	8614463	They'll get the pantsuit off of them anyway.
8614803	8622889	I mean, right now, the Australian tax board, as I said, they're owed lots of back taxes.
8623709	8639375	because, you know, as I said, if they outsource human resources and payroll to an Australian company that didn't do their job, it's the parent company's responsibility to make sure that those taxes are paid and everything is settled in whatever country they're operating.
8639995	8643817	I mean, this applies for any other company that sets a shop anywhere else.
8643837	8647278	You have to play by the local... You know, they have to play by the local...
8648839	8650640	Thank you very much for the call.
8651501	8651781	Alright.
8651801	8652101	Later, dude.
8676553	8676813	All right.
8677794	8678774	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8678794	8679155	Who's this?
8680495	8682196	Hi, this is Elite Slayer.
8682377	8684078	Hey, Elite Slayer, what's on your mind?
8685599	8701188	Well, I was actually on my laptop earlier, and we were starting to talk about the Halo Reach beta, and then they were like, oh, and they wanted to know more about the Halo storyline, and I know a lot about, like,
8701528	8728007	Bungie in the storyline and so we started talking about it and then this guy came on and then we got into this full-blown argument about whether there were Spartans left in the Halo saga when like Halo 3 was happening or not and I was on the side of that there was because you know just thinking Master Chief was he and the whole storyline was kind of following him and
8728607	8734618	But you never actually realize, you know, kind of the other Spartans that there may have been less.
8735589	8756655	So, um, but the other guy was talking about this, and I don't know where these facts are coming up, but he said that, um, in Halo 2 and in Halo 3, they're talking about how he was the last Spartan, and there was, um, no one else left, and he was the only guy that could help this war, and to be honest with you, I did not play Halo 2.
8757416	8764098	Um, I mean, I've watched all the cutscenes and everything, but I didn't watch Halo, I, I watched, I didn't play Halo 2.
8765278	8775990	Even though I know what's happening from the graphics to the world's worst cliffhanger on there, but I just seriously don't know.
8776031	8780936	This is driving me crazy about whether there was actually Spartans left in Halo 3 or there wasn't.
8780956	8781096	I mean...
8786693	8813115	is there like a place in the storyline that actually says there is or isn't because how they're talking about how in Halo Reach that's new coming up you know you can play the beta on May 3rd now when it comes up but how they're talking about how he had a squad and then they're thinking they all died you know I just don't know it's driving me crazy to be honest with you out of curiosity do you have your own show because you just talked for two minutes there it was fascinating
8814853	8825615	I mean, yeah, you know, you can say I'm kind of the person that can, I can actually talk a lot, but what I like to do for fun, like this may surprise you, I like to debate a lot.
8825975	8829596	I mean, I'm not kidding you.
8830476	8834957	People will be like, after it's done, they're like, you hate me now?
8835157	8838518	I'm like, no, dude, I just did that because I was pretty much bored.
8839518	8840560	That's it, you know?
8841020	8844544	That's my personality, to be honest with you.
8845305	8850691	Elite Slayer, I'm going to answer your question quite simply.
8850831	8851312	I don't know.
8854435	8863199	Did you happen to catch the new Halo Legends anime series?
8863659	8867241	There's a lot of different backstory stuff in there too.
8867261	8868041	Yeah.
8869782	8871602	Um, yeah, I'll tell you this, though.
8871762	8879664	Um, I saw, I saw the first four episodes of Halo Legends, and I looked at it, and I'm like, oh my god, you know?
8879904	8888306	I'm like, where, because a lot of the stuff there, it does go along the series, but then it's like, some of the stuff, you know, it's like they're just pulling out of their ass, you know?
8888626	8890146	I'm like, where did this come from?
8890806	8897308	Because in, um, the third episode, they're riding these motorbike things, um, in, like, space, and, um,
8899180	8900901	It just doesn't make any sense.
8902603	8905845	But I'm starting to say um a lot.
8905865	8906305	Oh, my God.
8906325	8907546	That's all right.
8907586	8908027	You're nervous.
8908087	8908667	It's a radio show.
8908707	8909648	Okay, wait.
8909888	8911509	We've got to wrap up here and go soon.
8911549	8912430	And I've got to be honest.
8912710	8915792	I don't know the answer to your Halo question, but maybe it's the answer to one of these books or whatever.
8916232	8918294	Oh, yeah, there's books too on the whole Halo thing.
8918314	8922777	But I want to debate you real quick on a certain topic, okay, since you're a big debate person.
8922797	8923317	Let's debate.
8924858	8928461	What is cooler, keyboard playing cats or keyboard playing –
8930321	8933762	All right, dude.
8934182	8937243	I got to go with... Yeah, I heard your segment on this earlier.
8937563	8939704	I got to say cats because just think.
8939924	8941444	Cats, you've got lol cats.
8941744	8942545	Cats are crazy.
8942585	8943965	You've got these animated gifs.
8944025	8945585	You've got all these things.
8946206	8948926	It's got to be one of a cool app.
8949066	8950147	Everyone loves kittens.
8950187	8950747	They're cute.
8950787	8952327	They've got all this funny crap with them.
8952367	8953087	They're swearing.
8953507	8955548	Kittens have... They're just awesome.
8957304	8960445	Okay, well, you're wrong, and you're an idiot!
8962080	8962840	No, dude.
8963120	8964981	I know what I'm doing, okay?
8965141	8966741	You're a liar, okay?
8966821	8967462	I got this.
8967502	8968502	Kittens are awesome.
8968882	8975684	I mean, I know I can sometimes be a dog person, but online and iPhones, kittens are so much better.
8976024	8976804	They're funner.
8976824	8978125	They lighten up your day.
8978425	8980245	I mean, they make you smile.
8980345	8980825	Come on.
8982086	8983246	It comes down to this, okay?
8983266	8984347	It hurts.
8984387	8988608	The easiest way you can determine which one's cooler, which is obviously cats, is because...
8989548	8990949	Okay, dogs are trainable.
8991029	8993071	Cats are the untrainable, okay?
8993111	8997394	To train a cat to play a keyboard, well, force a cat to play a keyboard, same thing.
8997794	9000215	Why are we even talking about this?
9001136	9001456	Why?
9001476	9002417	It's so much cooler.
9003418	9005259	This is pointless conversation.
9005279	9010142	Elite Slayer, this has been a heck of a call, but I've got to let you go so we can get some more.
9010383	9011663	But thank you for your call to the show.
9011723	9013405	Yeah, okay, later, man.
9013965	9015606	You know what was awesome about that phone call?
9016447	9018088	The fact that Shermie went and hid?
9018428	9019749	Not a damn thing came of it.
9019809	9021551	We never even bothered to answer his question.
9022671	9023912	Then he took two minutes to ask.
9023953	9024773	Dude, Wikipedia.
9026454	9027315	Halo Wiki.
9028816	9032639	The whole chat room is going, gong, gong, please end this.
9032900	9033680	Make it stop.
9033960	9035241	Why are you doing this to me?
9040285	9041406	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9041426	9041827	Who's this?
9042619	9048302	This is somebody who's not going to fap into a keyboard or sit there and get in a stupid conversation about stupid stuff like Halo.
9048562	9049062	Are you sure?
9049903	9050883	Oh, I'm definitely sure.
9050903	9051744	Dude, really?
9052124	9052904	What's on your mind?
9053345	9053805	Who is this?
9053865	9054545	What's up, guys?
9054565	9055786	This is X-Link.
9055866	9056906	This is X-Link.
9057007	9057707	Hi, X-Link.
9057727	9058407	What's on your mind?
9059448	9060428	Nothing much, man.
9061229	9066772	Just getting ready to shoot myself in the head with DMs calling every... Oh, I'm not going to get into it, seriously.
9066992	9071054	X-Link, it's the show where every gamer has a voice.
9071414	9072275	No, it's going to be soon.
9072295	9080364	It's going to be called... Next time you go in, wow, I'm going to put a hit on you with every single Horde member going after you for a surprise money for putting DS Master on the line.
9080424	9089154	It's going to be like an episode of The Guild, which, by the way, tangent, I watched the entirety of season one and two of The Guild last night with Alan because...
9089774	9093796	Everything was packed, except for the computer, because if you're a nerd, the computer's the last thing you pack.
9094156	9098177	So all I had was instant Netflix, because the PS3 was packed, all the DVDs were packed.
9098477	9102799	So we decided to watch instant Netflix, and I don't know if you know, but The Guild is now available seasons one and two on Netflix.
9103299	9113923	And you just kind of reminded me of one of the episodes where one of the guildies is kind of leading a secret double life to make one of the other guild members that she's mad at make his life hell.
9113943	9115544	I don't know, what did you think of The Guild?
9116184	9116744	Oh, I loved it.
9116944	9117565	Oh, you've seen it?
9117865	9118125	X-Link?
9119147	9119947	I'm sorry?
9119967	9120968	You've seen it, X-Link?
9121048	9122469	Oh, yes, yes, definitely, yeah.
9122849	9123909	I've seen both seasons, yes.
9124710	9126771	It's a little bit over the top for me.
9127131	9133074	Some of it's just a little too out there, but for nerd lols, it's pretty good.
9133414	9134134	What did you think, Alan?
9134154	9135055	You watched it too with me.
9135075	9135595	Did you like it?
9135655	9136816	Yeah, it was good.
9137356	9140337	I've been on WoW for about two or three months, so I get all the jokes now.
9140697	9141258	Yeah, there you go.
9141278	9143579	All right, what did you really call in to talk about tonight?
9144079	9151406	No, I was calling about the Ubisoft and what bastardization they're doing with the whole DRM and that stuff.
9151826	9158272	You know, like I said before, and besides the Imagination series and stuff like that, don't forget they also did the CSI series.
9158752	9164718	They were also part of the Press Your Luck, which, oh yeah, thanks Ubisoft.
9164738	9167200	Now I can't play any of those cool game show games.
9167300	9168101	You just hit a whammy.
9168241	9168641	Congrats.
9169822	9169962	Yeah.
9170763	9173186	So yeah, so now you're going to stop me from playing those as well.
9173286	9175408	And my mom, because my mom likes this series of games.
9175448	9179032	So you're going to make her stop because she doesn't have the internet connection in her place.
9180592	9181292	Bravo on that.
9181352	9184574	Though I know there's going to be a patch and there's going to be ways of getting around it.
9184594	9185774	So I'm not the least bit worried.
9185814	9190356	But still, I mean, just the fact that it's going to be a headache just for all that, you know.
9190977	9192237	And like you said before, it's going to be a headache.
9192257	9195839	You're going to have all these people who doesn't know all these different ways around it.
9195859	9201101	They're going to sit here and they're going to flood the support lines because of all this, you know.
9201141	9203102	And you can't take a PC game back to the store.
9203182	9204783	So best of luck on that.
9205523	9205904	So I...
9207813	9209975	Do you think, though, that it's going to work?
9210155	9212816	I mean, don't you think it's just going to get cracked within a couple days?
9212976	9217899	It will get cracked, but you've got to realize, too, a lot of people don't know this different stuff that we do.
9218039	9224382	And a lot of these people I'm going to feel bad for because they're going to buy the game, they're going to open it up, they're going to put it in, they're not realizing this is going to happen.
9224422	9227184	And once they realize it's going to happen, they're going to try to take it back to the store.
9227724	9230385	And they're going to be like, the store's going to be like, sorry, that's tough.
9230465	9231786	You should have known that beforehand.
9232046	9233807	I think you and I are on the same page there.
9234568	9236389	You don't want to debate me like the last caller did.
9236529	9238870	That's... Boring.
9239250	9239451	I know.
9239611	9239851	Alright.
9240231	9240751	Well, what else?
9241072	9243293	Anything else on your mind tonight, X-Link, before we let you go?
9244093	9245254	No, that was pretty much about it.
9245314	9248336	I just thought it was kind of interesting when I was hearing about all that.
9249176	9252298	There's more games than just the Imagination series.
9252338	9263785	With all these things we're seeing between the Ubisoft news and then we're talking about the whole SOCOM or whatever that game is on PSP that's going to have the multiplayer is going to charge if you didn't buy it new.
9265046	9266967	You're going to see all these inventive things.
9267407	9269309	It's not even the beginning of the end.
9270149	9277113	And the interesting thing about that would be that also is I would love to see the responses from people from eBay that don't know about it.
9277173	9282096	They buy the game used for their son or something, and then they figure out, you know, the son wants to play multiplayer.
9282116	9284877	They figure out they have to charge $20 for it to get to multiplayer.
9284897	9286778	That's going to be interesting to see the results of that.
9287779	9291881	Yeah, interesting as in about like a 20-car pileup on the side of the road.
9292342	9294003	All right, XLink, got to let you go, buddy.
9294243	9294803	But have a good one, okay?
9294843	9295423	No problem.
9295443	9295683	You too.
9295784	9295984	Bye.
9296844	9298065	We just have call after call tonight.
9298085	9298845	Let's go to another call.
9298905	9299846	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9299866	9300206	Who's this?
9301647	9302247	Hey, folks.
9302287	9303408	It's SSJ100 Matt.
9303548	9304748	Hi, SSJ100 Matt.
9304768	9305569	What's on your mind tonight?
9307870	9308370	Not much.
9308691	9309771	Definitely not Halo Reach.
9310211	9314894	But by the way, keyboard Zaku cats are better.
9316048	9316449	Oh, I see.
9316969	9319511	When it talks about keyboard cat and dog cat, ZakuCat wins.
9319752	9320132	That's fair.
9320292	9321553	Did you say dog cat?
9322074	9323275	Did I say dog cat?
9323295	9323975	You said dog cat.
9323995	9324956	I probably did say dog cat.
9325377	9334044	Well, you know, SSJ100Matt now is going to make me think of the whole shark and octopus videos with all the YouTubes he was linking tonight, which were A-plus videos, by the way.
9335686	9338388	When you can get videos to get a laugh on a radio show, you've done a good job.
9338408	9339209	Yeah.
9340396	9351042	So, um, actually, one thing I did want to talk about is, that will actually get us to the debate, you know, I'm talking about the, the USL Madness going on in the forums.
9351843	9355865	Uh-huh, yes, we played a little promo from, uh, Breslow a little earlier.
9355925	9357266	What do you think about what's going on there?
9358007	9363630	Well, I'm just, I'm just kind of amazed at just the amount of, like, heat that's going on in there.
9363750	9368853	Like, right now, Pokemon is beating Final Fantasy VII nine votes to four.
9369314	9369594	Mm-hmm.
9369834	9370014	Mm-hmm.
9371115	9378960	My question is, are a lot of people just voting against Final Fantasy VII because they just hate the fact that it's overhyped?
9380881	9381241	I don't know.
9382041	9388905	I think there's a large generation of modern fans that really just do not like Final Fantasy VII.
9389635	9390836	I think it's a little bit of both.
9390936	9395398	I think you have some genuine Pokemon fans, but I think some of that is anti-Final Fantasy VII votes too.
9395498	9399380	I think like any great political race, there's something like that going on there.
9399420	9402681	I wish there was more of a sampling of our audience voting in those polls, but what can you do?
9405615	9411699	But also, you know, we got Symphony of the Night losing to Legend of Zelda, which, you know, that's a good matchup.
9412519	9414681	Yeah, you know, I can't get mad about that.
9415001	9417202	To be honest, I can't get mad about the Pokemon 1 too.
9417262	9419264	I realize Pokemon has its rabid fanbase.
9419284	9423346	I mean, the anime is still going, and it's been going for, what, like at least 10 years now?
9423687	9426068	I mean, the anime is just not losing steam, and I get it.
9426148	9430011	Like, if it was losing to a game like, I don't know, Blades of Steel...
9430971	9432132	Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on there.
9432152	9433393	Hold on there.
9433713	9434273	Hold on there.
9434574	9435194	Now listen here.
9435294	9435694	I'm kidding.
9435774	9437476	I just wanted to start something.
9437716	9438816	Yeah.
9439557	9444921	But, um, no, I mean, no, my point is, you know, if you genuinely like Pokemon and think it's a better game, then I'm cool with that.
9444941	9448483	But, you know, if you just like, if you're voting against the game that, you know...
9449605	9454087	Just because it's overhyped or everyone likes it, like you said, haters to the left.
9471335	9500116	and I think 6 is still in it so you know I'm okay that if 7's out this round and one of the other Final Fantasy games continues but what's weird about the whole setup of the way and it's just I guess the way the cards fell and I know John has this very specific way of seeding everything in the match but it's really weird how like 3 Mario games and like 3 Zelda games are likely to take up the top 32 then again you know maybe Zelda and Mario shouldn't be so good
9501317	9504319	I know they're good games, I get it, but it's just weird.
9504980	9513106	Maybe I'm saying that because some of the games got grouped as series and some didn't, but I'm sure it had a lot to do with how people's lists were.
9513346	9517829	If you even look at my list, I probably did have two different Zelda games on it and two different Mario games on it.
9518309	9524214	They are really good series, but it's just interesting that we're going to be down to 16 and half of that is going to be Zelda and Mario.
9525563	9528084	Hey, you know, listen, I put Blades of Steel as number one.
9528604	9529024	I know you did.
9529044	9534685	Kind of jokingly, but you know, I, if you saw, you know, I wrote a ridiculous manifesto, just jokingly, but you know.
9535045	9535405	No, I know.
9535445	9536586	And Blades of Steel was a great game.
9536626	9536886	You know what?
9536986	9538226	I don't play a lot of sports games.
9538326	9538806	I really don't.
9538926	9540866	But I owned Blades of Steel on the NES.
9541147	9541887	That's how good it was.
9542167	9543067	It was a great game.
9543567	9544087	And it had Grotty's.
9544127	9544847	Only sports can ever know.
9544867	9545568	Grotty's Minigame.
9545888	9546588	All right, well, that's the show.
9546608	9546768	I'm Matt.
9546808	9548208	We're going to let you go so we can wrap things up.
9548228	9549068	But thanks so much for your call.
9549789	9550489	Yep, take it easy, man.
9550509	9550909	Have a good one.
9552049	9554011	Alright, apologies to those who didn't get through tonight.
9554051	9555452	We took like four calls tonight.
9555512	9559615	Usually when I take three, so send us an email if you didn't get through or a tweet.
9559655	9564198	We always appreciate those and we'll talk to you guys hopefully next time on Orange Lounge Radio.
9564258	9566280	But many, many different ways to interact with the show.
9566620	9570343	Chat room, Twitter, all that good stuff.
9570363	9573766	I think all the calls we got tonight were people that weren't on last week.
9573806	9575547	So it's good to kind of, or maybe Zaku was, I don't know.
9575587	9577409	But it's good to kind of spread the love a little bit.
9578189	9584233	Alright, we're going to go around and kind of start to wrap up the show, but first we've got to make sure all of our last minute stories are cleared out.
9584653	9586074	Anything else you guys wanted to bring up tonight?
9586114	9586354	Loki?
9586695	9587155	DarkSakura?
9587728	9588388	I like chocolate.
9589669	9591029	That's not a news-breaking story.
9591649	9598431	There's a few things from AOU 2010, the arcade expo that's in Japan.
9598912	9603233	They're showing off some of the new things, including Sega is bringing Project Diva to the arcades.
9603793	9606154	It's a rhythm music game.
9606214	9612376	Kind of looks a little bit like a cross between... I don't know.
9612836	9615557	Something like maybe a Parappa-type game with...
9618021	9618521	Oh, wow.
9619242	9620462	That Namco singing game.
9620622	9620942	I don't know.
9621622	9625824	Basically, it's just, you know, like a music rhythm game with chicks singing stuff.
9627145	9627565	It looks neat.
9627745	9635428	It's got these, not really poppin' music buttons, but it's basically got four buttons that kind of match the PlayStation face buttons.
9636548	9637328	So that's kind of neat.
9638009	9641170	And that'll be coming to arcades, I imagine, pretty soon.
9642010	9647036	Another one that they showed off that was actually really huge was Metal Gear Arcade.
9648117	9650119	Talk about one hell of a complex cabinet.
9650139	9651340	Oh yeah, I heard about this.
9651701	9660270	It's got these 3D glasses, head tracking built into those, it's like a goggle type thing.
9661090	9663313	You have a gun that you use and just...
9665251	9667712	Talk about... Well, that's just begging to get broken.
9668393	9671374	Yeah, talk about detailed, so that's kind of cool.
9672115	9674036	I don't know when that's going to be coming out.
9675337	9686163	Then we were talking, there's apparently there was some concern because of the rumors that Final Fantasy XIV is coming out this year that Final Fantasy XI will be going by the wayside with the release of that.
9687023	9687743	Is that for real?
9687763	9694607	Because I did remember before I had no internet after the move, I remember reading that story and I was like, there's no official word from Square Enix.
9694627	9696188	This seems like a rumor run wild.
9696968	9697549	Well, that's the thing.
9697869	9698389	It's not.
9698609	9699850	It's not going to be going by the wayside.
9699870	9708694	In fact, Wada tweeted, there seems to be a rumor that Final Fantasy XI is ending, but if that was done, we'd be in trouble.
9709835	9710917	Yoichi Wada Yoichi Wada
9724975	9727596	No, they can't shut down Eleven right now just to make room for 14.
9727657	9732159	EverQuest 1 and 2 ran at the same time and all these other ones that have sequels.
9732539	9734840	City of Heroes and Villains are running at the same time.
9735321	9737742	One's not going to close because the other is out.
9738162	9740704	Might there be server consolidations?
9742084	9744726	Yeah, that could happen and probably will happen.
9744766	9747027	I bet Eleven has a server consolidation by the end of the year.
9747287	9748208	But it's not going to close.
9748808	9749348	Not going to close.
9750049	9757253	And then the last thing, you remember that we mentioned that Perfect Dark would be coming to Xbox Live Arcade during March?
9757814	9764958	Well, with that will be the GoldenEye 007 maps from the game on Nintendo 64.
9765439	9768461	Those will be also coming to Perfect Dark as well as possibly the weapons.
9769021	9769881	Sneaky sneaky.
9771002	9773365	Thank you so much for coming and being on the show tonight.
9773385	9775587	I know you didn't get to say a whole lot, but I hope you had fun.
9795146	9796327	I did.
9796427	9797087	Thanks for having me.
9797167	9797728	No problem.
9797768	9801129	Come again sometime and don't be afraid to speak your mind.
9801289	9802870	It's where every gamer has a voice, Alan.
9802990	9805632	Do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?
9805752	9807273	My cat's breath smells like cat food.
9809634	9810735	Loki, your final thought tonight?
9811475	9814437	My final thought is I get to take off work tomorrow because I am sick.
9815637	9822221	My final thought is looking at the Dragon Quest slime on Dan's desk kind of makes me want to play Dragon Quest VIII.
9822661	9824162	I don't know why, but it was kind of cool.
9824912	9825972	DarkSakura, your final thought.
9826733	9829594	I'm totally addicted to this Sailor Senshi doll maker.
9833415	9837277	You are the reason Ubisoft has a market for those designer dress games.
9837317	9837777	No, I'm kidding.
9837797	9839638	No, probably you're right.
9841178	9842599	Actually, I'm kind of jealous watching you play.
9842939	9848921	No, thanks a lot, of course, for tuning in to our show and supporting and downloading and listening to Independent Radio.
9848961	9849782	We really appreciate it.
9849802	9850742	We do this show for free.
9851182	9852823	All we ask, if you enjoyed what you heard...
9853163	9853543	Outro Music
9873392	9875274	Even when it's an off night like tonight.
9875334	9875855	But you know what?
9875875	9877336	The whole chat room seems to be into it.
9877376	9878558	So hey, good times.
9879238	9879739	Thank you guys.
9879839	9881100	We really appreciate the support.
9881281	9883043	And we'll be back to do it all again next week.
9883063	9883683	What do you guys think?
9884564	9885065	Why not?
9885105	9885966	Why not?
9886146	9890210	So for myself, Alan, Loki, Jamie, and Shermie, good night.
9891084	9893785	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio
9922697	9924692	Thanks for watching!
