00:00:13,837 --> 00:00:24,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, February 14th, 2010, the X10 event brings us a barrage of Xbox news, you'll see less Guitar Hero in 2010, and what new video game is getting a movie screenplay written for it?

2
00:00:31,078 --> 00:00:35,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello everybody out there and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:35,482 --> 00:00:38,805
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:38,885 --> 00:00:39,986
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rob Roberts.

5
00:00:40,387 --> 00:00:45,972
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be talking to you over the next few hours here live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

6
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:49,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Joining me as she does every week, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura.

7
00:00:51,377 --> 00:00:52,818
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.

8
00:00:53,278 --> 00:00:55,380
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate that noise more than anything, you know that, right?

9
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that noise.

10
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,042
[SPEAKER_06]: You do that just to make me mad.

11
00:00:57,442 --> 00:00:59,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, just so you know, Jamie's a little sick tonight.

12
00:01:00,505 --> 00:01:01,066
[SPEAKER_02]: In the head.

13
00:01:01,486 --> 00:01:04,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's a given, that's always, that's like your thing.

14
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:06,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had the crap.

15
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:10,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, but you're not like coughing and sounding plaguey, you just, your voice is a little eh.

16
00:01:10,796 --> 00:01:11,816
[SPEAKER_02]: TechMasterLoki TechMasterLoki

17
00:01:39,949 --> 00:01:41,871
[SPEAKER_07]: The Difference Between Crocheting and Knitting

18
00:02:01,972 --> 00:02:02,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Not this, Rob.

19
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:03,694
[SPEAKER_06]: You're making me a scarf.

20
00:02:03,734 --> 00:02:04,054
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a scarf.

21
00:02:04,074 --> 00:02:05,495
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making you the gayest scarf ever.

22
00:02:05,555 --> 00:02:07,057
[SPEAKER_06]: I want a Rainbow Doctor Who scarf.

23
00:02:07,077 --> 00:02:07,897
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I asked for.

24
00:02:07,917 --> 00:02:08,398
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be fun.

25
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:08,998
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

26
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:09,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

27
00:02:09,339 --> 00:02:09,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Who cares?

28
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:16,885
[SPEAKER_06]: We're here, of course, every week, live Sunday nights, 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show, live at All Games Radio.

29
00:02:16,925 --> 00:02:19,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Big thanks to them for letting us steal their bandwidth every week.

30
00:02:19,728 --> 00:02:22,330
[SPEAKER_06]: It's www.allgames.com.

31
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:27,535
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to check out our own website and our show archives, you can head over to www.orangeloungeradio.com.

32
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:31,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight we're going to start off the show as we always do with a little bit of how was your gaming week.

33
00:02:32,578 --> 00:02:35,360
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, I know her voice is kind of bugging her.

34
00:02:35,661 --> 00:02:38,002
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go to her anyway and ask how our gaming week was.

35
00:02:38,443 --> 00:02:39,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Or better yet, you know what?

36
00:02:39,904 --> 00:02:40,744
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet I could guess.

37
00:02:41,205 --> 00:02:43,706
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to do my impersonation of DarkSakura's gaming week.

38
00:02:43,887 --> 00:02:44,207
[SPEAKER_06]: You ready?

39
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:44,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

40
00:02:46,368 --> 00:02:51,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, first off, I played Star Trek online, and I saw some Borg, and it was cool.

41
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,331
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't find any Borg.

42
00:02:53,411 --> 00:02:54,231
[SPEAKER_11]: I fought the Gorn.

43
00:02:54,371 --> 00:02:59,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I watched my husband play a first-person shooter, but it made me sick, so I decided to play Peggle.

44
00:03:00,353 --> 00:03:00,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Peggle!

45
00:03:01,094 --> 00:03:02,694
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I haven't played any Peggle.

46
00:03:03,515 --> 00:03:05,335
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought that was pretty good, Loki.

47
00:03:05,355 --> 00:03:09,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do you sound like Clarence from Wonder Shows Him?

48
00:03:09,337 --> 00:03:09,697
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

49
00:03:13,869 --> 00:03:15,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I did play Star Trek Online.

50
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:15,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course you did.

51
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,051
[SPEAKER_02]: I did shoot the Gorn, not the Borg.

52
00:03:18,091 --> 00:03:19,292
[SPEAKER_02]: The Gorn are the lizard people.

53
00:03:19,452 --> 00:03:19,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

54
00:03:20,172 --> 00:03:22,633
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was excellent.

55
00:03:24,054 --> 00:03:27,575
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I played Solitaire on my iPhone.

56
00:03:27,595 --> 00:03:28,456
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not play Peggle.

57
00:03:28,556 --> 00:03:31,057
[SPEAKER_02]: I found a Flash version of Bust a Move.

58
00:03:32,137 --> 00:03:33,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Puzzle Bobble.

59
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,562
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we got out some obscure game system from the vault and hooked it up and played it.

60
00:03:38,582 --> 00:03:43,445
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we played Chrono Trigger on the Super Nintendo.

61
00:03:44,006 --> 00:03:45,587
[SPEAKER_11]: And Dan was playing Ninja Gaiden 3.

62
00:03:47,688 --> 00:03:50,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we have the Ninja Gaiden trilogy on the SNES.

63
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,490
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

64
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,091
[SPEAKER_06]: How dare I say an obscure game?

65
00:03:54,512 --> 00:03:54,772
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob.

66
00:03:55,292 --> 00:03:55,512
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

67
00:03:57,453 --> 00:03:58,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Love you, mean it.

68
00:04:00,055 --> 00:04:01,776
[SPEAKER_02]: You did bring me coffee, so I forgive you.

69
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:03,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to try and do my gaming week?

70
00:04:04,346 --> 00:04:05,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to try and do my Gaming Week?

71
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:06,127
Well!

72
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty close, pretty close.

73
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:09,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to Loki next, though.

74
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,611
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your Gaming Week, Loki?

75
00:04:11,331 --> 00:04:13,973
[SPEAKER_07]: I just played lots of Grand Theft Auto.

76
00:04:15,414 --> 00:04:16,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, it was funny.

77
00:04:16,335 --> 00:04:21,458
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't run into him, but my coworkers ran into somebody that was actually cheating.

78
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:27,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Their console modded in a modded version of the game and they were cheating that way.

79
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:34,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Granted, we could do that again, but I just don't want to have to have all these banned consoles sitting around.

80
00:04:35,222 --> 00:04:40,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, can I just say in chat, of course, I haven't given them a shout out yet, but we always welcome our chatters every week.

81
00:04:40,183 --> 00:04:43,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to join us live on this Sunday evening.

82
00:04:44,144 --> 00:04:46,705
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're listening via the podcast, there's other ways you can interact with us.

83
00:04:46,905 --> 00:04:48,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Our Twitter feed at OLR.

84
00:04:48,405 --> 00:05:02,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Our Facebook at Orange Lounge Radio Or of course our mailbag Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com VidPower is live in our chat tonight and says Do Loki next Play GTA 4 then worked on Arcade Cabinet That would be the Loki impersonation No, that's about right

85
00:05:04,522 --> 00:05:07,504
[SPEAKER_07]: No, so we... I watched him play, this guy.

86
00:05:07,905 --> 00:05:09,746
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, it was just stupid.

87
00:05:09,786 --> 00:05:11,328
[SPEAKER_07]: But still winning.

88
00:05:11,608 --> 00:05:18,273
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually, I think I'm now in the 80s for... What was it?

89
00:05:18,994 --> 00:05:23,438
[SPEAKER_07]: True skill rank in single deathmatch.

90
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,139
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of cool.

91
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,501
[SPEAKER_07]: So top 80 players of the world.

92
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,263
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in...

93
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Just the cumulative deathmatch ranks.

94
00:05:34,448 --> 00:05:40,114
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm about to break 200, so I'll be in the top 200 there, which is cool.

95
00:05:40,334 --> 00:05:44,259
[SPEAKER_07]: And I still frustrate my coworkers a lot because I win all the time.

96
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:45,220
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

97
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,481
[SPEAKER_02]: You frustrate your co-hosts too.

98
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:47,302
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all right.

99
00:05:48,143 --> 00:05:49,164
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not because I win all the time.

100
00:05:49,918 --> 00:06:09,530
[SPEAKER_07]: and then I played more Borderlands so that was fun and just kind of working a little bit through that and download the two expansions for that so hopefully I'll play those soon and then finally did work on my arcade cabinet I replaced the graphics card that was in there and

101
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,131
[SPEAKER_07]: with a much faster one and much better one.

102
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:18,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Because before I had an arcade VGA card because they were meant to output to an arcade cabinet.

103
00:06:18,734 --> 00:06:24,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you can do it with other graphics cards, but you have to run a special driver to do it.

104
00:06:24,596 --> 00:06:25,477
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I did that.

105
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:27,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Finally, it took me forever to get the work right.

106
00:06:28,558 --> 00:06:32,120
[SPEAKER_07]: But now I can play my Naomi games full speed.

107
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,761
[SPEAKER_07]: I can play Street Fighter 4 full speed.

108
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:36,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

109
00:06:38,382 --> 00:07:05,551
[SPEAKER_07]: the only thing I can't play full speed right now that I really wish I could was my Taito X games like BlazBlue Continuum Shift is still kind of slow so I would need to get a slightly newer graphics card to get that one to work just right I think because the one I have right now the graphics card is only 64 bit which I should have bought a newer one but whatever so most of it works

110
00:07:07,116 --> 00:07:07,476
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

111
00:07:07,856 --> 00:07:09,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else you want to add?

112
00:07:09,917 --> 00:07:10,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, that's it.

113
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:11,878
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

114
00:07:12,618 --> 00:07:13,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

115
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:17,000
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura was kind of right when she was doing the impersonation of me there.

116
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,141
[SPEAKER_06]: I did play a little bit of WoW this week, still leveling the characters.

117
00:07:21,182 --> 00:07:24,303
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what my payback's going to be for poking fun at DarkSakura?

118
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:25,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Not making fun, poking fun.

119
00:07:25,704 --> 00:07:26,724
[SPEAKER_06]: I tease because I love.

120
00:07:27,124 --> 00:07:29,525
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to catch whatever she has, so I'm going to be here next week.

121
00:07:31,946 --> 00:07:32,887
[SPEAKER_02]: I put the fun in dysfunction.

122
00:07:49,409 --> 00:08:17,581
[SPEAKER_06]: MyGameWeek Not just WoW, I did play some other stuff too Although I did ding 37 I'm almost 38 Anyhow On my warrior Shut up Let's see, other games I played this week Because I did play some other stuff Okay, you remember last week on the show If you listened to last week's show I was squeeing all over the place Because Blaster Master Overdrive was coming out on the Wii Which is, you know, this sequel If you will, to the original Blaster Master On the NES

123
00:08:18,602 --> 00:08:21,545
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, of course, there was a version on the Genesis and Game Boy as well.

124
00:08:21,565 --> 00:08:23,447
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just kind of, I guess, assuming those didn't happen.

125
00:08:23,928 --> 00:08:25,650
[SPEAKER_06]: And this kind of came out of nowhere.

126
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,232
[SPEAKER_06]: It was released this week on WiiWare.

127
00:08:27,712 --> 00:08:31,777
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, of course, Monday, I go home from work, automatically download this thing right away.

128
00:08:31,817 --> 00:08:32,918
[SPEAKER_06]: And I spent a little time with it.

129
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:37,243
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure everybody wants to know my thoughts because I was so excited and I was happy about it last week.

130
00:08:37,303 --> 00:08:38,344
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I played it and...

131
00:08:40,146 --> 00:08:43,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess maybe I overhyped it a little bit.

132
00:08:43,749 --> 00:08:44,990
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't all that.

133
00:08:46,031 --> 00:08:46,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's the thing.

134
00:08:46,631 --> 00:08:47,832
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't bad.

135
00:08:48,733 --> 00:08:51,195
[SPEAKER_06]: It just wasn't what I thought it could have been.

136
00:08:51,996 --> 00:08:55,598
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple things I noticed right off the bat is that it did not support 16.9.

137
00:08:56,819 --> 00:09:00,683
[SPEAKER_06]: It still had the black bars on the left and right side of the screen on my widescreen TV.

138
00:09:01,403 --> 00:09:02,704
[SPEAKER_06]: The controls were a little weird.

139
00:09:02,744 --> 00:09:08,349
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the vehicle is supposed to control a little odd, but I felt like they overcompensated in the Blaster Master game.

140
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:36,389
[SPEAKER_06]: um one of the things that kind of bugged me is I felt the different stages didn't have a lot of um differentness between them there wasn't a lot of uniqueness between the levels it's like one level was cave and it had brown walls and one level was outdoors but you go into a cave right away the other level was like ice cave and you're you have blue walls and and when you go into the overhead areas they're they're not that exciting they look like the dungeons from the 8-bit willow on the NES I mean it just kind of

141
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:40,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Just different variations of a little maze like that.

142
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:43,813
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wasn't all that floored with it.

143
00:09:44,153 --> 00:09:45,554
[SPEAKER_06]: But then you have to look at the other side of it.

144
00:09:45,634 --> 00:09:46,355
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the game was only $10.

145
00:09:47,455 --> 00:09:49,016
[SPEAKER_06]: They did Metroid it a little.

146
00:09:49,036 --> 00:09:50,577
[SPEAKER_06]: You have save points, you have maps.

147
00:09:50,717 --> 00:09:55,060
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like the way they did save points because only certain caves have save points.

148
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,702
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes you don't want to drive around for 20 minutes looking for a save point.

149
00:09:59,082 --> 00:10:00,783
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I...

150
00:10:02,344 --> 00:10:03,544
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

151
00:10:23,171 --> 00:10:28,217
[SPEAKER_06]: That had been made for another system and then finished for the Wii.

152
00:10:28,257 --> 00:10:38,106
[SPEAKER_06]: I seriously think what I played was made for the PS1 or PS2 and then for whatever reason it didn't happen, it came out on the Wii instead.

153
00:10:38,807 --> 00:10:40,269
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what the game kind of felt like to me.

154
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:44,393
[SPEAKER_06]: It felt like a mediocre PS1 game just suddenly now on the Wii.

155
00:10:44,913 --> 00:10:45,093
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

156
00:10:45,914 --> 00:11:08,268
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, the value, $10, the music kicks ass, a lot of the remixes are really cool, and you know, there is that nostalgia factor My only other big bitch, and this is damn near a game ruiner for me, like this is why I can't play Blaster Master Overdrive for long periods of time The controls blow, they absolutely blow, and it's one really logical flaw that makes it blow

157
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:13,017
[SPEAKER_06]: You use your Wiimote, like, tilted to the side like an NES controller.

158
00:11:13,317 --> 00:11:15,278
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, all the buttons pretty much are used.

159
00:11:15,398 --> 00:11:17,839
[SPEAKER_06]: You use the A button, the giant one, to switch weapons.

160
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,061
[SPEAKER_06]: You use the 1 button to fire your weapon, which, you know, makes sense.

161
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:25,643
[SPEAKER_06]: You use the 2 button to fire a super weapon, which you do once in a great while.

162
00:11:25,943 --> 00:11:27,944
[SPEAKER_06]: So you don't really... And you don't want to hit that inadvertently.

163
00:11:28,424 --> 00:11:31,646
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you use the trigger button on the back of the controller...

164
00:11:31,926 --> 00:11:32,226
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.

165
00:11:51,526 --> 00:11:52,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Sucks.

166
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:53,987
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not holding it.

167
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,228
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know who thought that.

168
00:11:56,368 --> 00:11:57,808
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the first thing that made me think.

169
00:11:57,828 --> 00:12:10,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Why can't they just do it the old way where you would just hold the fire button down and then it would just stay firing in that one direction and you can move around strafe and then you just basically let go of it and turn and then hold it down again to shoot a different direction.

170
00:12:11,072 --> 00:12:13,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft asks, does it have classic controller support in our chatroom?

171
00:12:13,394 --> 00:12:15,695
[SPEAKER_06]: It does not, which I thought was a glaring omission too.

172
00:12:15,715 --> 00:12:17,557
[SPEAKER_06]: You can only play it with the NES controller.

173
00:12:32,948 --> 00:12:36,811
[SPEAKER_06]: or I'm sorry NES style regular Wiimote tilted to the side.

174
00:12:38,593 --> 00:12:39,433
[SPEAKER_06]: The controls blow.

175
00:12:39,694 --> 00:12:43,617
[SPEAKER_06]: I was really irritated that I couldn't remap it and that's the first thing that made me think.

176
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:48,120
[SPEAKER_06]: I think someone just brought this over from like PS2 and thank you chat rooms for reminding me.

177
00:12:48,841 --> 00:12:50,682
[SPEAKER_06]: They did release a Blaster Master on PSX.

178
00:12:50,722 --> 00:12:51,043
[SPEAKER_06]: They did.

179
00:12:51,763 --> 00:12:55,726
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know if this was like a sequel that they started to make or a PS2 version.

180
00:12:55,786 --> 00:12:56,087
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

181
00:12:56,927 --> 00:12:59,929
[SPEAKER_06]: or, again, I'm hypothesizing just based on what I played.

182
00:12:59,969 --> 00:13:03,692
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't feel like it was made for the Wii because I think if it was, it would have supported 16.9.

183
00:13:04,752 --> 00:13:07,034
[SPEAKER_06]: So the controls really kind of ruined it for me.

184
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:13,618
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's too bad because at the end of the day, it still seems like there's a fun game in there somewhere.

185
00:13:14,158 --> 00:13:16,500
[SPEAKER_06]: And for $10, it's still not a terrible deal.

186
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,542
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just I would urge you to go spend your money on the original game.

187
00:13:20,194 --> 00:13:21,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, that's what I do.

188
00:13:21,956 --> 00:13:23,156
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was Blaster Master Overdrive.

189
00:13:38,328 --> 00:13:39,269
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

190
00:13:53,485 --> 00:14:22,221
[SPEAKER_06]: as far as Castle Crashers goes I love how they have all these little in jokes and they really souped it up and they added some things into it like you know fighting each other to see who can kiss the girl and the little power ups and the magic you know I think they did definitely take that genre of gaming to the next level so I was you know definitely Castle Crashers is a good buy if you haven't already bought it I mean it's like what the best selling Xbox 360 arcade game so I imagine most of you own it I just I'm slow in getting around to some games okay um

191
00:14:23,832 --> 00:14:50,755
[SPEAKER_06]: and then I didn't really play a whole lot else in depth but I watched my boyfriend play tons of games because he got a brand new monitor this week that's like a 25 inch monitor it's huge it's very similar to Dan's monitor it's gigantic and I just watched him play like Left 4 Dead 2 and Half-Life 2 like every neat looking game he owned he had to load within the scope of like two hours and it was pretty I will admit it was pretty and you know I played WoW on that thing too and it was very pretty very pretty

192
00:14:51,756 --> 00:14:53,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, that's about it for our gaming weeks.

193
00:14:54,297 --> 00:14:55,758
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to move on.

194
00:14:55,818 --> 00:14:57,719
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get into some news here in just a moment.

195
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:59,180
[SPEAKER_06]: But first, we want to take some housekeeping.

196
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,140
[SPEAKER_06]: It is Valentine's Day.

197
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,242
[SPEAKER_06]: So for those that are celebrating Valentine's Day, happy Valentine's Day.

198
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope it was a good one.

199
00:15:04,763 --> 00:15:08,345
[SPEAKER_06]: For those that aren't, well, take a moment to celebrate what you really love today.

200
00:15:08,645 --> 00:15:09,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Video games.

201
00:15:10,406 --> 00:15:14,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Join our chat, chat.orangeloungeradio.com and talk about the latest in gaming news this week with us.

202
00:15:15,268 --> 00:15:18,210
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, our Twitter and all that other stuff as well that I mentioned earlier.

203
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:18,870
[SPEAKER_06]: X10 Event

204
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:49,483
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, if you remember, I mean, the original Dead Rising came out, I think, 07 or 08?

205
00:15:49,884 --> 00:15:50,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Around the same time?

206
00:15:51,024 --> 00:15:51,805
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it was in August.

207
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:53,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but that's pretty cool.

208
00:15:54,426 --> 00:15:56,487
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, uh, some of the stuff they were also showing off about it.

209
00:15:56,507 --> 00:16:09,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, apparently, of course, since this, you know, being X10, they announced that they're gonna have an exclusive, uh, to Xbox Live, Dead Rising 2 K-0, uh, which is a prologue to the sequel of the game.

210
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:29,526
[SPEAKER_07]: and we'll kind of work as a game add-on and not only that it's basically going to be the demo for the game so you'll get to kind of get your Dead Rising on slightly earlier than the game actually comes out well now Loki demos are usually free and I'm guessing this is not going to be free

211
00:16:30,346 --> 00:16:43,037
[SPEAKER_06]: um maybe yeah okay maybe I mean maybe I'm not giving enough credit I mean if it's just gonna be a giant advertisement for the game maybe it will be free who knows but I just kind of doubt it I don't know why I'm being skeptical

212
00:16:44,624 --> 00:16:46,425
[SPEAKER_06]: History shows this kind of crap is usually not free.

213
00:17:09,252 --> 00:17:09,813
[SPEAKER_06]: He says no.

214
00:17:10,794 --> 00:17:12,596
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell them with the microphone, do you like games?

215
00:17:13,737 --> 00:17:14,058
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

216
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then I don't know if we're going to be able to talk too much on the show tonight.

217
00:17:19,724 --> 00:17:20,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want mommy?

218
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like to play the guitar?

219
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:24,732
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Rob.

220
00:17:46,877 --> 00:17:47,157
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

221
00:17:47,878 --> 00:17:49,580
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll have achievements and all that good stuff, though, right?

222
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

223
00:17:50,581 --> 00:17:54,385
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what would make a good... By the way, we have comments in chat room.

224
00:17:54,425 --> 00:18:03,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Chat.orangeonestradio.com Blackwolf in chat, our pal Bobby Blackwolf, who's on before us every Sunday at All Games Radio, says, Julian sounds like the ferret.

225
00:18:04,014 --> 00:18:04,234
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

226
00:18:06,276 --> 00:18:07,638
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to get him to say, excuse me.

227
00:18:07,658 --> 00:18:11,622
[SPEAKER_11]: No, he's the one to look in the garage.

228
00:18:12,243 --> 00:18:13,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's where all the pinball machines are, huh?

229
00:18:13,645 --> 00:18:14,526
[SPEAKER_02]: He loves the garage.

230
00:18:14,646 --> 00:18:15,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, of course he does.

231
00:18:16,188 --> 00:18:16,748
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a boy.

232
00:18:16,908 --> 00:18:18,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, we let a two-year-old derail the show, but that happens.

233
00:18:18,771 --> 00:18:19,972
[SPEAKER_06]: But he doesn't like games, though.

234
00:18:20,172 --> 00:18:20,452
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

235
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,114
[SPEAKER_11]: Dead Rising 2 Dead Rising 2 Dead Rising 2 Dead Rising 2

236
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:54,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I took pictures of zombies or something like, you know, Dead Rising, Snap.

237
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:12,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Dead Rising is awesome.

238
00:19:36,328 --> 00:19:37,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, I enjoyed Dead Rising 2.

239
00:19:37,448 --> 00:19:38,929
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of a pleasant little surprise.

240
00:19:39,129 --> 00:19:41,749
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm kind of curious where they're going to go with the sequel.

241
00:19:42,129 --> 00:19:43,410
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the picture-taking thing, though.

242
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,370
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the whole opening of the first game was like taking pictures, wasn't it?

243
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but see, he's not a journalist this time.

244
00:19:48,231 --> 00:19:54,412
[SPEAKER_07]: This time he's like, you know, a duct tape expert because, you know, that's... Is that an actual job?

245
00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:58,973
[SPEAKER_06]: You can like... What would you study in college to become a duct tape expert?

246
00:20:00,513 --> 00:20:01,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Fusion, I would imagine.

247
00:20:04,134 --> 00:20:04,414
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

248
00:20:04,793 --> 00:20:05,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbox Live X10

249
00:20:24,578 --> 00:20:27,921
[SPEAKER_06]: The first game that's going to come out on March 3rd is called Toy Soldiers.

250
00:20:29,001 --> 00:20:33,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Scrap Metal is coming out as well, as well as Perfect Dark.

251
00:20:33,405 --> 00:20:37,968
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, they're going to do a remake of Perfect Dark, and that's coming out on Xbox Live Arcade this March.

252
00:20:38,188 --> 00:20:41,971
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, kind of coming out of nowhere, Game Room is coming out.

253
00:20:42,031 --> 00:20:44,212
[SPEAKER_06]: It has been confirmed that that will come out in March.

254
00:20:44,593 --> 00:20:45,914
[SPEAKER_06]: So at least we have a target date for that.

255
00:20:46,414 --> 00:20:47,755
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm guessing just...

256
00:20:48,035 --> 00:20:49,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect Dark Playthrough Perfect Dark Playthrough

257
00:21:09,557 --> 00:21:10,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe.

258
00:21:10,117 --> 00:21:11,158
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw him jumping.

259
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:12,738
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a remake of the N64 one.

260
00:21:12,758 --> 00:21:13,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he can't jump in that.

261
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:14,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I don't know.

262
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:17,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, by the way, some of the price is already out for some of those as well.

263
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect Dark will set you back $10, 800 Microsoft points.

264
00:21:20,901 --> 00:21:23,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Toy Soldiers and Scrap Metal, $15 a piece.

265
00:21:23,462 --> 00:21:24,843
[SPEAKER_06]: That's 1,200 Microsoft points.

266
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:31,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, Game Room is free to download, but it will cost $3 if you want to play it on one system, either your 360 or your PC.

267
00:21:31,945 --> 00:21:33,486
[SPEAKER_06]: 400 Microsoft points or $5 for both systems.

268
00:21:37,147 --> 00:21:41,728
[SPEAKER_06]: or 50 cents, 40 Microsoft points for one play.

269
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:46,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I always thought it was supposed to be two plays, two quarters for two plays, but I guess they scaled it back to one.

270
00:21:48,029 --> 00:21:48,549
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

271
00:21:48,589 --> 00:21:52,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are some of the prices of the games coming out on Xbox Live in March.

272
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,111
[SPEAKER_06]: So definitely a very busy month.

273
00:21:54,371 --> 00:21:55,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything you guys are looking forward to?

274
00:21:55,691 --> 00:22:02,412
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm all about Game Room as much as I'm a little bit irritated that I've bought a lot of those games before.

275
00:22:02,972 --> 00:22:04,873
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what else I played this week?

276
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:05,553
[SPEAKER_06]: The other night...

277
00:22:07,754 --> 00:22:34,955
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Alan was playing WoW or something and I was just I was there you know hanging out and I just fired up old Atari 2600 games I started playing Pitfall 2 The Lost Caverns I was playing that for a little bit and then I was playing an old old game called and I can't remember the name now Dragonfire I think it was called it was there was two modes to it one was where you were running across the drawbridge and you had to dodge the fireballs and then the second screen was you had to collect all the treasure and dodge the fireballs from the dragon I think it's called Dragonfire

278
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:37,638
[SPEAKER_06]: I played those games for like an hour.

279
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:38,979
[SPEAKER_06]: It's crazy.

280
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,884
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm all about Game Room and playing some of the classic games again as long as it's not stuff I've already bought.

281
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:51,472
[SPEAKER_06]: So I won't be buying Scramble, thank you very much, or Frogger, or Tempest or anything else that's already been on Xbox Live.

282
00:22:51,492 --> 00:22:56,136
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not buying Frogger just despite Frogger because I hate...

283
00:22:57,838 --> 00:23:02,063
[SPEAKER_07]: and the incessant whoring out of Frogger.

284
00:23:02,263 --> 00:23:04,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Konami, get a new game to whore out.

285
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

286
00:23:05,147 --> 00:23:08,470
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not Frogger itself, the classic game that you have a problem with.

287
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,873
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the incessant whoring of the franchise and what it's become.

288
00:23:10,893 --> 00:23:13,336
[SPEAKER_07]: They have made me hate the original game of Frogger now.

289
00:23:13,837 --> 00:23:17,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I remember when they first came out with that Frogger game on PS1, it was awesome.

290
00:23:17,838 --> 00:23:23,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, that first Frogger revival game was awesome when it first came out, but then it's like, that's all they make now.

291
00:23:25,021 --> 00:23:26,821
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't know.

292
00:23:27,822 --> 00:23:29,362
[SPEAKER_06]: But the original Frogger's okay.

293
00:23:29,422 --> 00:23:30,423
[SPEAKER_06]: My favorite Frogger...

294
00:23:31,303 --> 00:23:37,308
[SPEAKER_06]: My memories of Frogger were of being in 4th grade on roller skates playing at the skating rink in Dothan, Alabama

295
00:24:00,546 --> 00:24:02,989
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a roller rink in Roseville, California that I used to go to.

296
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:03,730
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's still there.

297
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,631
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Roller King.

298
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,734
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to play Spy Hunter in the arcade there.

299
00:24:06,894 --> 00:24:13,883
[SPEAKER_02]: They had that same Frogger machine for at least 10 years.

300
00:24:15,224 --> 00:24:18,068
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would play it every summer on roller skates.

301
00:24:18,382 --> 00:24:20,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of Frogger hate in our chat room.

302
00:24:20,365 --> 00:24:23,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Chat.orange.com Ray Iannami says Frogger sucks.

303
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Spyro says Frogger is scary.

304
00:24:25,733 --> 00:24:27,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Toagak says Frogger, go get hit by a car.

305
00:24:27,896 --> 00:24:31,862
[SPEAKER_02]: To this day though, I play Frogger best on roller skates.

306
00:24:32,964 --> 00:24:33,805
[SPEAKER_02]: On an arcade machine.

307
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:39,068
[SPEAKER_06]: I play Spy Hunter best with roller skates, which always fascinated me because it had a gas pedal on those machines.

308
00:24:39,089 --> 00:24:41,850
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to see Frogger Shattered Soldier.

309
00:24:42,551 --> 00:24:44,652
[SPEAKER_07]: The funniest thing I ever saw.

310
00:24:44,852 --> 00:24:49,656
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this was in Chico, at a roller rink in Chico, California, where I went to school for college.

311
00:24:50,016 --> 00:24:56,480
[SPEAKER_06]: They had a DDR machine in a roller rink, and the first time I ever saw that, I was like, you know something bad's going to happen on that machine.

312
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:01,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Some idgit's going to hop up on there and try to play in roller skates.

313
00:25:01,364 --> 00:25:01,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

314
00:25:01,784 --> 00:25:04,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, HitStun is showing the other side of the spectrum here.

315
00:25:04,326 --> 00:25:05,487
[SPEAKER_06]: One other comment about Frogger.

316
00:25:05,507 --> 00:25:08,729
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how we got on this tangent, and then we'll go to DarkSakura with another news story.

317
00:25:09,069 --> 00:25:11,251
[SPEAKER_06]: But HitStun gives another side of the token here.

318
00:25:12,232 --> 00:25:15,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Frogger is a great first video game for kids.

319
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:17,876
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a valid argument.

320
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,757
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a good kid video game.

321
00:25:19,997 --> 00:25:21,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, do you think he has a point?

322
00:25:24,541 --> 00:25:29,104
[SPEAKER_07]: If they want to turn him off of video games because they're going to frustrate the hell out of him.

323
00:25:30,727 --> 00:25:33,970
[SPEAKER_02]: I can look at it as an educational tool for hand-eye coordination.

324
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:38,053
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a classic excuse we use with our parents.

325
00:25:38,214 --> 00:25:40,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Mother, I'm working on my hand-eye coordination.

326
00:25:41,196 --> 00:25:48,162
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're dealing with the concept of objects in motion.

327
00:25:49,583 --> 00:26:16,928
[SPEAKER_02]: so it honestly and I've actually I found a study on this a few years ago where they were saying talking about games like Frogger as being ones that teach about physics in motion so well but couldn't you learn hand-eye coordination from Street Fighter 4 you know let the kid get his butt kicked a little but it's the whole point of things moving in opposite directions of you know horizontal versus vertical movement you know spatial relations

328
00:26:18,314 --> 00:26:18,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, fine.

329
00:26:19,135 --> 00:26:23,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Azure Edge in chat, by the way, jumped in and said Battletoads was his first game.

330
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:25,806
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a game that gets you sick.

331
00:26:25,826 --> 00:26:26,527
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a game.

332
00:26:27,228 --> 00:26:28,610
[SPEAKER_02]: I can already tell you what mine was.

333
00:26:29,632 --> 00:26:30,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Pong.

334
00:26:30,093 --> 00:26:31,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, of course.

335
00:26:31,114 --> 00:26:31,996
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Kangaroo.

336
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:37,599
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember what my first first game was, but I have really early memories of playing combat.

337
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:41,781
[SPEAKER_06]: It was probably combat when the family got an Atari 2600 and Spider-Man.

338
00:26:42,061 --> 00:26:47,764
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember going in my mom's bedroom where the Atari 2600 was hooked up so that she could limit my playtime to play Spider-Man.

339
00:26:47,984 --> 00:26:52,226
[SPEAKER_02]: We always had CryptoQuip at my friend's house because we had an Odyssey 2.

340
00:26:53,206 --> 00:26:54,267
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

341
00:27:06,149 --> 00:27:29,704
[SPEAKER_06]: I always wanted a ColecoVision but my mother I think I have two my mother wouldn't give me one because she says we have an Atari 2600 we don't need the other one which you know she made a point the ColecoVision I'm sorry was far superior alright especially since it had the expansion module that you could play Atari 2600 games on plus once we got the Commodore 64 that's really all I played for years and years I didn't even touch 2600 anymore it was all about the Commodore 64 that thing was awesome what was it TI-85 nice

342
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:34,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, let's move on with more gaming news.

343
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:35,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Fast forward to now.

344
00:27:36,992 --> 00:27:37,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

345
00:27:38,334 --> 00:27:40,036
[SPEAKER_02]: I really shouldn't have been talking that much, too.

346
00:27:40,056 --> 00:27:40,737
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

347
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:44,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Halo Reach Beta has a date.

348
00:27:45,003 --> 00:27:48,727
[SPEAKER_02]: It's May 3rd, but only if you already have ODST.

349
00:27:50,449 --> 00:27:58,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, at the X10 event, Microsoft made the announcement that the multiplayer beta was going to begin for the ODST owners.

350
00:27:58,892 --> 00:28:04,754
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, that means you have to actually have the ODST disk to access the beta.

351
00:28:05,814 --> 00:28:07,315
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yay, I have it.

352
00:28:07,848 --> 00:28:10,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, I mean, it makes sense.

353
00:28:10,829 --> 00:28:16,472
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the people that are going to want to play Halo Reach right away already have Halo ODST.

354
00:28:16,632 --> 00:28:17,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it makes sense.

355
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:26,737
[SPEAKER_06]: I imagine if you're a Halo fan, you know, it's not like they're pairing it with a game like Crackdown where you have to kind of go outside the genre to pick up this game.

356
00:28:26,757 --> 00:28:29,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, remember when the Halo 3 beta came with Crackdown?

357
00:28:29,318 --> 00:28:32,380
[SPEAKER_06]: You had to buy this completely different game to get access to the Halo 3 beta.

358
00:28:33,407 --> 00:28:34,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Crackdown was fun, though.

359
00:28:34,388 --> 00:28:38,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, although it turned out, I mean, thankfully, Crackdown was a pretty good game, but imagine if it hadn't been.

360
00:28:39,312 --> 00:28:40,513
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that could have been a bad thing.

361
00:28:40,854 --> 00:28:44,237
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I mean, it makes sense that they're doing it that way.

362
00:28:44,277 --> 00:28:46,539
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to tell you what the joy of Crackdown was for me.

363
00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:49,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Jump, wave, jumping, huge.

364
00:28:49,201 --> 00:28:52,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming in the house and having Dan and Will play Crackdown.

365
00:28:53,445 --> 00:28:54,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Going, I like jumping!

366
00:28:55,447 --> 00:28:55,787
Yeah.

367
00:28:56,107 --> 00:28:57,488
[SPEAKER_02]: and that little high-pitched voice.

368
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:58,769
[SPEAKER_03]: I like jumping!

369
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I like jumping!

370
00:29:01,571 --> 00:29:02,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

371
00:29:02,872 --> 00:29:03,352
I know.

372
00:29:03,452 --> 00:29:04,573
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets stuck in my head.

373
00:29:04,893 --> 00:29:09,277
[SPEAKER_02]: So every time I think about Crackdown, I instantly hear Dan and Will in my head going, I like jumping!

374
00:29:09,537 --> 00:29:11,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you won't have to worry about that when Perfect Dark comes out.

375
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,100
[SPEAKER_02]: I like not jumping.

376
00:29:14,801 --> 00:29:16,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, what do you think of the whole Halo thing?

377
00:29:16,642 --> 00:29:22,326
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, for me, I'm like, oh darn, I would have liked a free demo that I could download and play, but I can't hate on what they're doing.

378
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:26,385
[SPEAKER_07]: They did the same thing with Crackdown, of course.

379
00:29:26,585 --> 00:29:29,666
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not surprised that they're doing the same thing with this.

380
00:29:31,066 --> 00:29:38,688
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't care because I didn't play much of the Halo 3 beta and I just can't see myself playing much of the Halo Reach beta.

381
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:44,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Halo Online for me is just not that big.

382
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:45,951
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

383
00:30:10,493 --> 00:30:10,894
[SPEAKER_06]: That much.

384
00:30:11,134 --> 00:30:13,878
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can't see myself getting into these other ones.

385
00:30:13,898 --> 00:30:14,539
[SPEAKER_06]: But you never know.

386
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:19,946
[SPEAKER_06]: If my college buddies call me up and say, Rob, you gotta get Halo Reach so we can all play again, I'd probably do it.

387
00:30:20,787 --> 00:30:21,187
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

388
00:30:22,469 --> 00:30:23,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on.

389
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:26,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, you have a lot, a lot of news here coming from another presser.

390
00:30:26,502 --> 00:30:30,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, EA, they had a bunch of stuff coming out.

391
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:33,664
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say it's from their end of the fiscal quarter stuff.

392
00:30:34,484 --> 00:30:40,745
[SPEAKER_07]: And they released their tentative release schedule for fiscal 2011.

393
00:30:41,345 --> 00:30:47,787
[SPEAKER_07]: So running from April or I guess, yeah, April to April 2011.

394
00:30:47,827 --> 00:30:47,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

395
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:56,735
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, some stuff's not a big surprise, you know, sequels to big franchises.

396
00:30:57,455 --> 00:31:04,180
[SPEAKER_07]: One that's already been teased already, Dead Space 2 is slated for early 2011.

397
00:31:04,361 --> 00:31:07,383
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't really say when, I guess Q4 of 2011, so...

398
00:31:09,324 --> 00:31:11,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Summer between January and March of 2011.

399
00:31:12,466 --> 00:31:17,688
[SPEAKER_07]: You can expect that one to be coming, of course, on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

400
00:31:18,048 --> 00:31:22,330
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe they're skipping the PC version this time around.

401
00:31:23,011 --> 00:31:35,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Some other things also have been teased before and are coming by holiday of 2010, Crisis 2, which was on the cover recently of one of the game magazines, supposed to be taking place in New York.

402
00:31:36,877 --> 00:31:39,699
[SPEAKER_07]: and Sims 3 will be making its way out to consoles.

403
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:50,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Also NBA Jam coming this holiday and EA Sports MMA supposed to be coming out between October and December of 2010 as well.

404
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:56,280
[SPEAKER_07]: and some other smaller stuff also being put out.

405
00:31:58,141 --> 00:32:02,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, new Harry Potter, tie in with the Deathly Hallows.

406
00:32:03,243 --> 00:32:05,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, those games make money.

407
00:32:06,104 --> 00:32:09,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Those Harry Potter games, they make money and they've only got a little bit left.

408
00:32:09,686 --> 00:32:12,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, they'll probably still find a way to crank out those games even when the movies are done.

409
00:32:12,927 --> 00:32:18,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, I could see them doing some... Hell, they did Lord of the Rings games for the longest time.

410
00:32:19,172 --> 00:32:21,054
[SPEAKER_07]: They have another Lord of the Rings game coming out in the movie.

411
00:32:21,074 --> 00:32:22,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Harry Potter MMO.

412
00:32:23,476 --> 00:32:24,997
[SPEAKER_06]: You know someone wants to do it.

413
00:32:25,838 --> 00:32:26,959
[SPEAKER_06]: You know someone wants to do it.

414
00:32:26,999 --> 00:32:27,720
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be epic.

415
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:33,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Do it a Harry Potter MMO with all the people I know that are really into the Harry Potter fandom.

416
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:35,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Just log on to LiveJournal.

417
00:32:35,146 --> 00:32:36,527
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll find tons of people that love

418
00:32:36,727 --> 00:32:38,449
[SPEAKER_06]: That would get Nelly playing MMOs.

419
00:32:38,809 --> 00:32:44,114
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm telling you, I am kind of shocked there isn't already one talked in development.

420
00:32:45,175 --> 00:32:57,426
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be the game somebody makes once all the others... Wouldn't it be awesome, just totally unrealistic and never going to happen, but wouldn't it be awesome the next game that Blizzard is developing is Harry Potter MMO?

421
00:32:57,606 --> 00:32:57,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

422
00:32:58,747 --> 00:33:00,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like something ridiculous.

423
00:33:00,768 --> 00:33:01,409
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

424
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:06,512
[SPEAKER_06]: If Blizzard were making that, even I would have to play it.

425
00:33:06,692 --> 00:33:07,493
[SPEAKER_06]: I really would.

426
00:33:07,993 --> 00:33:08,854
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I've said.

427
00:33:08,914 --> 00:33:10,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Blizzard really doesn't make bad games.

428
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:13,076
[SPEAKER_06]: They haven't made a bad game in about 25 years.

429
00:33:14,257 --> 00:33:15,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Blizzard doesn't really make bad games.

430
00:33:17,859 --> 00:33:18,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Some other games coming out.

431
00:33:19,681 --> 00:33:34,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Between July 1st and September 30th, the real-time world's crime-themed MMO, which this will probably get me into MMOs as well, APB, or what I like to call Saints Row Grand Theft Auto Online, which would be awesome.

432
00:33:35,251 --> 00:33:42,635
[SPEAKER_07]: and then of course the next Medal of Honor game right now slated for the summer as well.

433
00:33:42,795 --> 00:33:44,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, no, I take that back.

434
00:33:44,596 --> 00:33:51,000
[SPEAKER_07]: It's sometime between now and March 2011, so anytime I guess for Medal of Honor.

435
00:33:52,601 --> 00:34:01,451
[SPEAKER_07]: And, let's see, to kind of go with the more casual crowd, they're going to be doing some new EA Sports Active games, which are due out around this holiday.

436
00:34:02,172 --> 00:34:06,116
[SPEAKER_07]: And, of course, it's not surprising, but they're going to be possibly...

437
00:34:07,297 --> 00:34:16,966
[SPEAKER_07]: I played those games myself and I had a bitch with them and my bitch was you couldn't skip exercises that the system was not recognizing you as actually doing due to the limitations of the Wii motion recognition which ticked me off.

438
00:34:30,459 --> 00:34:31,100
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

439
00:34:51,539 --> 00:35:00,304
[SPEAKER_06]: and you can use the board if you have it but a common misconception about EA Sports or EA Active, you do not need the balance board to play it.

440
00:35:00,504 --> 00:35:04,426
[SPEAKER_06]: It comes with a little wrist strap thing that you don't even really use.

441
00:35:04,446 --> 00:35:05,487
[SPEAKER_06]: The resistance band.

442
00:35:05,647 --> 00:35:08,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Well yeah, the resistance band, I'm sorry, not the wrist strap, the leg strap.

443
00:35:09,569 --> 00:35:14,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you put this thing on your leg and you put the Wiimote in it so it senses when you're running a little better.

444
00:35:15,493 --> 00:35:17,334
[SPEAKER_02]: I would rather just have real resistance bands.

445
00:35:18,918 --> 00:35:22,941
[SPEAKER_02]: The only reason I've won it because that's a better workout.

446
00:35:23,362 --> 00:35:27,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing is going to replace like the gym and eating healthier.

447
00:35:27,805 --> 00:35:31,529
[SPEAKER_07]: But it will probably be a little bit better than fake hula hooping on.

448
00:35:31,549 --> 00:35:32,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, exactly.

449
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,631
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what though I think that a great way to lose weight is?

450
00:35:35,212 --> 00:35:35,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Stomach virus.

451
00:35:37,314 --> 00:35:37,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Tapeworm.

452
00:35:38,795 --> 00:35:39,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Tapeworms, too.

453
00:35:55,045 --> 00:35:56,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that it or is there more EA?

454
00:35:56,626 --> 00:35:57,687
[SPEAKER_07]: There's more, just real quick.

455
00:35:58,307 --> 00:36:02,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, Dragon Age will be getting a sequel in early 2011 as well.

456
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:06,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Now this is important because Dragon Age was pretty badass.

457
00:36:06,573 --> 00:36:10,456
[SPEAKER_07]: What's also interesting though is it will be making its way out to portables as well.

458
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:12,918
[SPEAKER_07]: The DS and PSP or possibly cell phones.

459
00:36:16,262 --> 00:36:20,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Epic Dragon Age is very epic, so I'm not surprised at all that there's a sequel.

460
00:36:20,404 --> 00:36:21,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Sequel to a successful franchise?

461
00:36:21,925 --> 00:36:22,265
[SPEAKER_06]: No!

462
00:36:22,646 --> 00:36:26,148
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of surprised it's coming out so fast, but there you go.

463
00:36:27,308 --> 00:36:29,289
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only, what, a year since the last one?

464
00:36:29,549 --> 00:36:30,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but this is coming out in 2011.

465
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:31,431
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be over a year.

466
00:36:31,451 --> 00:36:32,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, they didn't say beginning 2011.

467
00:36:32,931 --> 00:36:33,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Early 2011.

468
00:36:33,112 --> 00:36:33,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's 18 months, maybe.

469
00:36:39,896 --> 00:36:41,237
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll probably be the same engine.

470
00:36:41,558 --> 00:36:45,822
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really a long time in the gaming world.

471
00:36:45,863 --> 00:36:46,964
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.

472
00:36:47,845 --> 00:36:48,305
[SPEAKER_06]: True.

473
00:36:48,325 --> 00:36:52,810
[SPEAKER_06]: They've already put out at least two of those EA Active games, if not three or four.

474
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,913
[SPEAKER_06]: There's going to be even more, but still.

475
00:36:54,933 --> 00:36:59,418
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like a one-tenth of a Duke Nukem Forever.

476
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:03,111
[SPEAKER_06]: All I'm saying is that, you know, they need to just make sure you take the time to get it right.

477
00:37:03,151 --> 00:37:03,431
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all.

478
00:37:03,631 --> 00:37:06,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Mass Effect 1 and 2 probably had a similar gap between them, right?

479
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Mass Effect 1 and 2 is probably what?

480
00:37:08,514 --> 00:37:10,575
[SPEAKER_06]: About 18 months or maybe two years, right?

481
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:12,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe somebody in chat knows better.

482
00:37:12,776 --> 00:37:15,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Mass Effect 1, I believe, was November 08.

483
00:37:16,577 --> 00:37:18,898
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, yeah, it's about the same.

484
00:37:18,998 --> 00:37:23,460
[SPEAKER_06]: There's people out there proclaiming Mass Effect 2 is the greatest video game ever made, period.

485
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,862
[SPEAKER_07]: It's supposed to be better because it's, you know, the combat's a lot better.

486
00:37:27,322 --> 00:37:29,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, it looks interesting, but I'm not going to buy it.

487
00:37:30,044 --> 00:37:33,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's on my to-play list, but I've got to be honest with y'all.

488
00:37:34,348 --> 00:37:42,614
[SPEAKER_06]: I have been a Final Fantasy fanboy since the very, very first one that my friend and I used the strategy guide made by Nintendo Power to get through.

489
00:37:43,635 --> 00:37:45,096
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be buying Final Fantasy XIII.

490
00:37:45,136 --> 00:37:47,398
[SPEAKER_06]: You probably won't hear me talk about anything but that until I beat it.

491
00:37:48,118 --> 00:37:48,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

492
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:50,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow.

493
00:37:52,244 --> 00:37:56,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, that didn't really happen with Final Fantasy XII, but I blame XII.

494
00:37:57,409 --> 00:37:59,911
[SPEAKER_06]: XII should not have been on the PS2, but that's for another day.

495
00:37:59,951 --> 00:38:02,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Go back and listen to old episodes if you want to know more thoughts on that.

496
00:38:03,774 --> 00:38:04,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so I don't know.

497
00:38:04,795 --> 00:38:08,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything out of EA real quickly before we move on with the news that makes you very excited?

498
00:38:08,178 --> 00:38:13,083
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the Dragon Age story is pretty cool, and NBA Jam I'm certainly looking forward to as well.

499
00:38:13,827 --> 00:38:20,210
[SPEAKER_07]: I think NBA Jam is going to be a letdown because the NBA games haven't been that great.

500
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:28,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless they make it control more like a traditional NBA Jam game, that's the only way I can see that being good.

501
00:38:28,413 --> 00:38:34,795
[SPEAKER_07]: But either EA's NBA Live games are not good on the Wii.

502
00:38:36,035 --> 00:38:39,877
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, they sold so poorly that they didn't put one out this year.

503
00:38:41,554 --> 00:39:01,722
[SPEAKER_06]: AkumaJP in chat says don't get your hopes too high though Rob that's a good point I've heard Final Fantasy XIII has been getting some slack the whole like no towns thing and it's linear but well and also I should know better than to get my hopes high very high for a game because that's what I do with Blaster Master we just need Blitz, NFL Blitz

504
00:39:02,902 --> 00:39:04,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking Final Fantasy, but whatever.

505
00:39:04,163 --> 00:39:04,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

506
00:39:04,623 --> 00:39:04,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

507
00:39:05,003 --> 00:39:06,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Final Fantasy is going to be awesome.

508
00:39:06,284 --> 00:39:08,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's what Akuma's saying.

509
00:39:08,164 --> 00:39:08,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Be careful.

510
00:39:08,605 --> 00:39:10,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't hype it too much because it might not be all that.

511
00:39:12,607 --> 00:39:14,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, people have been playing the Japanese version.

512
00:39:14,367 --> 00:39:15,668
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it sounds good, so.

513
00:39:17,267 --> 00:39:22,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well moving on to some, I don't know, this is kind of a mixed bag of news.

514
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:23,291
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good news and bad news.

515
00:39:24,372 --> 00:39:30,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Activision plans on reducing the number of Guitar Hero, Band Hero, and the Music Hero franchises that they do in 2010.

516
00:39:30,636 --> 00:39:41,043
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is coming word of mouth from the Activision Publishing CEO, Mike Griffith, who of course they had a conference call this week, saying that fewer SKUs will service a broader audience.

517
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:41,963
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2009, we released 25 music SKUs.

518
00:39:42,024 --> 00:39:44,005
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2010, we plan to release less than 10.

519
00:39:47,367 --> 00:39:56,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, of course, the speculation is, okay, well, they're going to do away with probably the PS2 bundles that can't be selling very well and probably a lot of these band-specific games and so forth.

520
00:39:56,514 --> 00:40:04,460
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, they do a lot of game and then game plus plastic instrument, game plus plastic instruments.

521
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,021
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're going to be cutting back on those.

522
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:08,283
[SPEAKER_06]: I imagine a lot of these are going to be game only, right?

523
00:40:08,403 --> 00:40:10,925
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll leave the bundling to the Costcos of the world, right?

524
00:40:11,646 --> 00:40:11,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

525
00:40:12,486 --> 00:40:12,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

526
00:40:13,807 --> 00:40:20,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think, and although you're going to hear that there's just less music games coming from them, which I think we all kind of view as a good thing.

527
00:40:21,373 --> 00:40:23,574
[SPEAKER_06]: We knew Guitar Hero was getting too saturated.

528
00:40:23,634 --> 00:40:29,679
[SPEAKER_06]: This whole Guitar Hero, Van Halen, Guitar Hero 5, Band Hero, all coming out within like a month of each other, too much.

529
00:40:30,339 --> 00:40:30,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Too much.

530
00:40:31,600 --> 00:41:01,305
[SPEAKER_06]: unfortunately when you talk about making a decision like that which we do say is a good thing the bad news is they're going to lay off people because they don't need them anymore and some different companies really got hit hard with layoffs this week I heard Neversoft really got hit hard also Underground Development who made the Guitar Hero Van Halen game and they also did a Dave Mira BMX series they've been slaughtered completely they're out also surprisingly kind of an end of an era

531
00:41:01,585 --> 00:41:02,986
[SPEAKER_06]: for us here at Orange Lounge Radio.

532
00:41:03,026 --> 00:41:06,007
[SPEAKER_06]: You know this show started because of Dance Dance Revolution.

533
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:08,649
[SPEAKER_06]: We all met playing DDR at the arcade and talked about music games.

534
00:41:09,209 --> 00:41:19,734
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you've ever been to a DDR tournament, especially back in the day, it was probably sponsored by a little company trying to sell their DDR pads and their expensive mats that would help you do a better DDR game at home.

535
00:41:20,154 --> 00:41:21,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Red Octane, that's how they started.

536
00:41:22,135 --> 00:41:27,318
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, as you know, Red Octane teamed up with Harmonix for the first Guitar Hero game.

537
00:41:28,298 --> 00:41:28,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Red Octane

538
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:31,499
[SPEAKER_06]: has been shut down.

539
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:38,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Only the staff that is directly involved with instrument development will stay at Activision, otherwise the rest of it's gone.

540
00:41:39,522 --> 00:41:41,942
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of the end of an era in ways.

541
00:41:42,142 --> 00:41:43,483
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know, what do you guys think?

542
00:41:43,663 --> 00:41:49,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Having been fans of music games and kind of knowing Red Octane and seeing their peeps out at DDR Tournament, what do you think?

543
00:41:49,724 --> 00:41:51,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw this coming for the moment of the acquisition.

544
00:41:53,245 --> 00:41:53,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I say it?

545
00:41:55,165 --> 00:41:56,286
[SPEAKER_06]: It's sad but true, yeah.

546
00:41:56,526 --> 00:41:57,006
[SPEAKER_06]: I could see that.

547
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:00,923
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew they were going to squeeze what they could out of them the moment the money got bad.

548
00:42:01,223 --> 00:42:01,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut.

549
00:42:02,704 --> 00:42:02,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki?

550
00:42:03,565 --> 00:42:04,185
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not surprised.

551
00:42:04,886 --> 00:42:12,592
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been cutting a lot of different smaller studios and stuff, but guess we're not going to get in the groove.

552
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:19,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I gotta say, now the in the groove fanboys can finally shut the fuck up.

553
00:42:20,097 --> 00:42:21,238
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously.

554
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:23,400
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just not going to happen.

555
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Just go away.

556
00:42:25,641 --> 00:42:45,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Duke Nukem Forever will happen before that so anyhow yes also as mentioned let's see what else Luxaflux was shut out never soft employees were hit half of radical entertainment staff I mean it's just it was it was not fun times at Activision this week so of course

557
00:42:46,294 --> 00:42:46,855
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

558
00:43:04,668 --> 00:43:05,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

559
00:43:06,909 --> 00:43:12,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how about something, a different type of sacking altogether.

560
00:43:14,651 --> 00:43:29,155
[SPEAKER_02]: For anyone who was interested, and I'm really not one of them, but I know people who were interested in the Alan Wake game, they actually announced that the PC version is not going to be happening again.

561
00:43:29,856 --> 00:43:36,003
[SPEAKER_02]: The Xbox 360 version of Alan Wake will be out on May 21st, but it will not be out on PC.

562
00:43:36,083 --> 00:43:36,924
[SPEAKER_02]: It just will not work.

563
00:43:39,795 --> 00:43:43,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't know, is this surprising or no?

564
00:43:43,077 --> 00:43:49,641
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, in a way, a lot of these games now are developed with the console in mind first, and then the PC secondary, so if it didn't work, it didn't work.

565
00:43:50,241 --> 00:44:04,230
[SPEAKER_06]: But still, if you're still a PC gamer at heart, and I gotta say, you know, I was watching Alan play Bioshock this week on his, just for a little bit, on his fancy new monitor, and he's got a video card and everything, I was like, dang, this, in a lot of ways, this looks better than it does on the 360.

566
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:08,553
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's, there's still a lot of good stuff in PC games.

567
00:44:08,713 --> 00:44:08,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Well,

568
00:44:09,153 --> 00:44:14,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to tell you, because keep in mind, now I'm playing Star Trek Online with an old video card.

569
00:44:15,134 --> 00:44:16,474
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to be upgrading mine soon.

570
00:44:16,574 --> 00:44:23,636
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've seen screen captures for people who've played on the newest GeForce, and it's amazing.

571
00:44:24,256 --> 00:44:28,697
[SPEAKER_02]: So really having the right card makes all the difference with a lot of PC games.

572
00:44:30,057 --> 00:44:31,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, here's an example, Rob.

573
00:44:32,277 --> 00:44:36,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonic R, which I have on Saturn, and I have on PC.

574
00:44:37,699 --> 00:44:41,043
[SPEAKER_02]: and I played it back in the day when I got a new Radeon on the PC.

575
00:44:41,604 --> 00:44:53,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Same game, either way, played so much better on the PC, looked cleaner, so it does make a difference if your computer's a little bit better than spec, you know what I mean?

576
00:44:54,418 --> 00:45:03,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Part of me thinks I'll be playing Microsoft Game Room more on my PC than I will my 360 because, well, I won't have to use the 360 controller on my PC.

577
00:45:03,341 --> 00:45:06,422
[SPEAKER_06]: I can get a decent pad for like 15 bucks.

578
00:45:06,782 --> 00:45:08,262
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the 360 controller.

579
00:45:09,103 --> 00:45:10,323
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate the D-pad, though.

580
00:45:10,383 --> 00:45:12,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Playing a classic game on that's going to blow.

581
00:45:13,584 --> 00:45:16,425
[SPEAKER_06]: So, unless Microsoft releases a new pad.

582
00:45:16,725 --> 00:45:19,946
[SPEAKER_02]: I still want an adapter so I can use my Saturn dual analog controller.

583
00:45:20,846 --> 00:45:22,787
[SPEAKER_02]: The best controller ever.

584
00:45:23,547 --> 00:45:24,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I am interested in Alan Wake, though.

585
00:45:24,848 --> 00:45:25,689
[SPEAKER_06]: I will throw that out there.

586
00:45:25,709 --> 00:45:30,272
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want to play that when it comes out among all the other, my gosh, games to catch up on this year.

587
00:45:30,992 --> 00:45:33,574
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, quick follow-up to the last story we were talking about.

588
00:45:33,714 --> 00:45:37,416
[SPEAKER_06]: I just decided for Chits and Giggles to go to RedOctane.com.

589
00:45:38,077 --> 00:45:41,919
[SPEAKER_06]: It now forwards you automatically to the GuitarHeroStore.com.

590
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,200
[SPEAKER_06]: It did for the longest time.

591
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,340
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

592
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:16,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, let's travel around the globe and check out some upcoming release dates for things on systems you will be able to get.

593
00:46:17,653 --> 00:46:27,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, this week, in fact today, you can pick up your Wii Remote in blue or pink just in time for Valentine's Day.

594
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:31,602
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that you know what sex your Wii Remote is.

595
00:46:34,303 --> 00:46:38,445
[SPEAKER_07]: On the Wii will be Data East Arcade Classics coming out this week.

596
00:46:38,925 --> 00:46:42,367
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can get your BurgerTime and your Bad Dudes on.

597
00:46:42,547 --> 00:46:43,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's cool.

598
00:46:43,148 --> 00:46:44,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that coming out on any other systems or just Wii?

599
00:46:44,948 --> 00:46:45,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Just Wii.

600
00:46:46,229 --> 00:46:46,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh.

601
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:48,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you a bad enough dude to say the president?

602
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,291
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say Bad Dudes.

603
00:46:51,388 --> 00:46:55,910
[SPEAKER_07]: And it also has the BurgerTime sequel on there.

604
00:46:56,951 --> 00:46:58,371
[SPEAKER_06]: I've played the BurgerTime sequel.

605
00:46:59,972 --> 00:47:07,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's a typical sequel to an arcade game where the original was more fun in your memories than the sequel was.

606
00:47:08,896 --> 00:47:13,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Dynasty Warriors Strike Force coming out this week on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

607
00:47:15,561 --> 00:47:23,026
[SPEAKER_07]: SOCOM US Navy SEALS Fireteam Bravo 3 finally making its way out after quite a few delays on PSP this week.

610
00:47:35,996 --> 00:47:37,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, playing it in English.

[SPEAKER_07]: Tropico 3, coming out on Xbox 360 this week.

612

613
00:47:48,263 --> 00:47:55,507
[SPEAKER_07]: The sequel to the music-making game, Korg DS 10+, making its way out on the DS.

614
00:47:55,687 --> 00:47:57,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that like Korg is in the keyboard?

615
00:47:57,368 --> 00:47:57,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it is.

616
00:47:58,069 --> 00:47:58,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Sweet.

617
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:03,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Chicken Riot, a budget shooter game coming out on the Wii.

618
00:48:04,833 --> 00:48:04,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:07,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here.

620
00:48:11,127 --> 00:48:13,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Free Running, making its way out on the Wii.

621
00:48:14,775 --> 00:48:14,995
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

622
00:48:18,389 --> 00:48:42,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Deadly Premonition coming out on Xbox 360 this week kind of a budget survival horror game and the PC collection of Strong Bad's cool game for attractive people making its way out as well and looks like a re-release of the oh no actually this may be the original Fallout Fallout trilogy on PC for $14.99 not bad

623
00:48:44,747 --> 00:48:45,127
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

624
00:49:01,997 --> 00:49:10,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Dante's Inferno makes its way, a version for Japan coming out this week on the 18th, as well as Eat Lead, the return of Matt Hazard coming out on the 360.

625
00:49:10,625 --> 00:49:15,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Heading on over to the PlayStation 3, of course you also get Biohazard 5 there, but they call it the Alternative Edition.

626
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:20,813
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if this is just simply a price reduction or if they were adding something to it.

627
00:49:20,873 --> 00:49:23,876
[SPEAKER_07]: It might be the Gold Edition that's coming out over here in March.

628
00:49:24,156 --> 00:49:24,636
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it is.

629
00:49:24,977 --> 00:49:27,419
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like the, you know, souped up a little bit.

630
00:49:27,879 --> 00:49:30,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, of course, Eat Lead and Dante's Inferno, also on the PS3.

631
00:49:31,123 --> 00:49:38,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Also on the PS3, something that had a demo here in the States this week, Heavy Rain, the origami killer, comes out on the 18th in Japan.

632
00:49:38,613 --> 00:49:44,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Also in Japan, Shin Sangoku Mosu Online, Kamishu Rambu comes out.

633
00:49:45,141 --> 00:49:45,281
[SPEAKER_06]: It's...

634
00:49:46,022 --> 00:49:47,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that Romance of the Three Kingdoms?

635
00:49:47,403 --> 00:49:48,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think it's nice.

636
00:49:48,463 --> 00:49:50,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's right.

637
00:50:03,411 --> 00:50:05,053
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks Dynasty Wars-ish.

638
00:50:05,273 --> 00:50:08,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it has the combo meter and everything.

639
00:50:08,156 --> 00:50:13,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably a mix of the two because it is from Koei.

640
00:50:14,942 --> 00:50:19,066
[SPEAKER_07]: That might be their version of Strike Force or there's a Samurai Warriors game coming out.

641
00:50:19,687 --> 00:50:20,448
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network,

642
00:50:35,546 --> 00:50:37,547
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if that one's coming out exactly.

643
00:50:38,487 --> 00:50:40,607
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, there is a premium version of that if you want as well.

644
00:50:40,707 --> 00:50:43,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, quickly, big release for PS3 in Japan this week.

645
00:50:43,528 --> 00:50:44,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Skate 2 gets a price reduction.

646
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:46,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Uncharted gets a bundle pack this week.

647
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:49,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Next week, Demon's Souls is getting a price reduction.

648
00:50:49,269 --> 00:50:51,310
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a pretty awesome PS3 exclusive.

649
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:55,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing on the Wii this week in Japan, which is somewhat surprising.

650
00:50:55,191 --> 00:50:57,451
[SPEAKER_06]: That's because next week is a pretty big week.

651
00:50:57,492 --> 00:51:02,433
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a lot of games, including the Tales of Symphonia getting a price reduction.

652
00:51:02,453 --> 00:51:03,153
[SPEAKER_06]: That's next week, though.

653
00:51:04,093 --> 00:51:17,924
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation 2 of course the pickings are getting a little slimmer there on PS2 but they have a game called Last Escort Club Kotze is coming out in regular and limited editions the DS gets Yu-Gi-Oh!

654
00:51:17,984 --> 00:51:20,986
[SPEAKER_06]: 5D's World Championship 2010 Reverse of Arcadia

655
00:51:21,738 --> 00:51:25,761
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're still playing Yu-Gi-Oh!, you're in for a treat this week in Japan.

656
00:51:26,221 --> 00:51:43,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Lastly on the PSP this week, Last Escort as well, and let's see, SOCOM, Fate Unlimited gets a price reduction, Densetsu no Yushin no Densetsu Legendary Saga comes out as well.

657
00:51:44,355 --> 00:51:46,697
[SPEAKER_06]: So a lot of little games here and there on the PSP this week.

658
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:47,898
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

659
00:51:48,238 --> 00:51:49,459
[SPEAKER_06]: That does it for Japanese releases.

660
00:51:50,431 --> 00:51:52,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in the UK, we've got a small list.

661
00:51:52,372 --> 00:51:56,355
[SPEAKER_02]: We have on the 18th, Puzzle Chronicles on DS and PSP.

662
00:51:57,175 --> 00:52:10,643
[SPEAKER_02]: 19th, we have Ace Attorney Investigations, Miles Edgeworth, Aliens vs. Predator, Dynasty Warrior Strike Force Special, Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney, Justice for All, and Real Fishing Angler's Dream.

663
00:52:13,408 --> 00:52:14,310
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's it for me.

664
00:52:15,111 --> 00:52:23,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, just a few more stories for you guys and then we're going to get to the classic video game of the week because we just wouldn't have a show here at OLR if we couldn't have our classic game of the week.

665
00:52:24,004 --> 00:52:25,847
[SPEAKER_06]: But a few new stories first, Loki.

666
00:52:27,415 --> 00:52:44,290
[SPEAKER_07]: During an acceptance speech at the Japan Media Arts Festival, Miyamoto was referring to an unannounced Nintendo hardware and at least one new Wii project he's working on, which uses the Wii Motion Plus peripheral.

667
00:52:45,170 --> 00:53:14,237
[SPEAKER_07]: and of course he didn't make any formal announcements or anything like that but apparently there is something being worked on and I guess we'll just have to wait to find out what exactly that is but I'm not surprised that there's new hardware coming I would guess probably a new handheld I know, hasn't there just been rumblings and it seems like we've had stories little hints dropped by Nintendo for quite a while now there is some type of motion enabled DSi coming out or like a DS2 or something that's going to be dumb

668
00:53:16,115 --> 00:53:19,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the DS isn't a bad system.

669
00:53:19,879 --> 00:53:21,041
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just flooded with shovelware.

670
00:53:21,261 --> 00:53:26,827
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not saying it's dumb that they're putting out another system.

671
00:53:27,228 --> 00:53:31,092
[SPEAKER_07]: The reason why I'm saying that is because they just came out with the DSi a year ago.

672
00:53:31,112 --> 00:53:31,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

673
00:53:34,864 --> 00:53:38,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, think about when we were transitioning into the DS.

674
00:53:38,405 --> 00:53:41,306
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember the year we were there at E3, seeing the DS.

675
00:53:41,366 --> 00:53:44,487
[SPEAKER_06]: It was our first E3, the year they showed off the DS for the very first time.

676
00:53:44,907 --> 00:53:46,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember what else they were showing off?

677
00:53:46,547 --> 00:53:48,628
[SPEAKER_06]: The micro advances at the same time.

678
00:53:49,028 --> 00:53:53,229
[SPEAKER_06]: And there were people saying, well, who the hell would want to buy a micro advance when they just announced the DS?

679
00:53:53,669 --> 00:53:54,889
[SPEAKER_06]: But Jamie bought one.

680
00:53:55,369 --> 00:53:57,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not say that I bought one.

681
00:53:57,770 --> 00:53:58,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not.

682
00:53:58,310 --> 00:53:59,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry, Jamie.

683
00:53:59,531 --> 00:54:00,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Acquired one.

684
00:54:00,531 --> 00:54:01,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Acquired one.

685
00:54:01,331 --> 00:54:30,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, here's the difference though between that though, whereas the DSi is being treated as a new platform, I mean they are now starting to put out DSi exclusive games and then you know, they're going to probably slowly phase out the DS stuff I guess, I don't know why they would do that because they have so many right now, but to put out yet another hardware platform that's going to be a portable system that's kind of like, what the hell, I mean say you just bought a DSi you know, and it's got a, you know

686
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:34,602
[SPEAKER_07]: It does have feature enhancements compared to the DS.

687
00:54:34,662 --> 00:54:38,965
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not just, look, we made it smaller, or look, we made it larger, or look, we made it purple.

688
00:54:39,245 --> 00:54:42,868
[SPEAKER_06]: A camera and memory storage or whatever the DSI had.

689
00:54:42,908 --> 00:54:44,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Memory storage, download service.

690
00:54:44,609 --> 00:54:45,750
[SPEAKER_06]: I never bothered with DSI.

691
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:47,071
[SPEAKER_07]: I barely play my DS anymore.

692
00:54:47,091 --> 00:54:47,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, exactly.

693
00:54:47,831 --> 00:54:48,311
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't either.

694
00:54:48,391 --> 00:54:54,375
[SPEAKER_07]: But the thing is, if they're going to put out a motion-enabled platform as well that's not compatible with this...

695
00:54:55,856 --> 00:54:58,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, how many times are they going to get you to buy the DS?

696
00:54:59,058 --> 00:55:00,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I guess, how many times did you buy the Game Boy?

697
00:55:00,879 --> 00:55:08,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, hasn't every Nintendo handheld just been an evolution of the previous one of some sort, and they've all kind of been backwards compatible?

698
00:55:08,382 --> 00:55:11,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think at this point they're going to have to come out with something new, like new-new.

699
00:55:12,084 --> 00:55:13,584
[SPEAKER_07]: New hardware platform, period.

700
00:55:13,744 --> 00:55:14,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Still play DS carts.

701
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:15,345
[SPEAKER_06]: It will.

702
00:55:17,126 --> 00:55:17,566
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fine.

703
00:55:18,086 --> 00:55:18,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

704
00:55:19,147 --> 00:55:19,727
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not buying it.

705
00:55:21,104 --> 00:55:23,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Telling you right now, I'm not paying for another handheld.

706
00:55:23,625 --> 00:55:27,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they're turning into Apple, where every year there'll be something bigger and better and newer.

707
00:55:30,049 --> 00:55:31,450
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not touching Apple stuff either.

708
00:55:32,611 --> 00:55:37,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well here's something maybe Loki could play that is for a Nintendo system, and I think this would be pretty exciting.

709
00:55:38,294 --> 00:55:46,959
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a game being developed by Epicenter, and they have combined the games Guitar Hero and Typing of the Dead.

710
00:55:47,959 --> 00:55:50,261
[SPEAKER_06]: to bring you Rock of the Dead.

711
00:55:51,021 --> 00:56:02,510
[SPEAKER_06]: So you use a rock band or guitar hero controller on your Wii and you use it to basically kill undead by playing different fret patterns or hitting different buttons on the guitar will allow you to kill zombies.

712
00:56:03,391 --> 00:56:08,194
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know if that sells you guys right there, but then they also go on to say they're serious.

713
00:56:08,554 --> 00:56:12,437
[SPEAKER_06]: They've brought in some like uber nerdy star tech power into this game.

714
00:56:13,138 --> 00:56:15,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Neil Patrick Harris will be the voice of the main character.

715
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Felicia Day will also be doing a voice

716
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:41,278
[SPEAKER_07]: is you basically have, you know, something that is knocking off House of the Dead.

717
00:56:41,699 --> 00:56:46,482
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, even knocking off Typing of the Dead instead of a keyboard, it's the fret buttons.

718
00:56:46,662 --> 00:56:48,143
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, there's going to be a lawsuit.

719
00:56:48,363 --> 00:57:03,313
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, seriously, the names are too, you know, if it was like, you know, Zombie Rock or something like that, you know, the names are too similar, the presentation's too similar, the gameplay's too similar, it's going to be, they're going to have a lawsuit.

720
00:57:03,593 --> 00:57:06,114
[SPEAKER_06]: You think Sega will sue to get the name changed?

721
00:57:06,674 --> 00:57:08,794
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Zombie Rock.

722
00:57:08,934 --> 00:57:12,575
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they will sue them because, let me put it this way, this company is putting this out as a conspiracy.

723
00:57:13,455 --> 00:57:14,075
[SPEAKER_07]: They're a nobody.

724
00:57:14,215 --> 00:57:17,556
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they're like a really small development house.

725
00:57:18,736 --> 00:57:19,257
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, though?

726
00:57:19,917 --> 00:57:22,057
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it when small studios have good ideas, though.

727
00:57:22,077 --> 00:57:23,858
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a good idea.

728
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:25,378
[SPEAKER_07]: They just ripped someone else off.

729
00:57:25,618 --> 00:57:29,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, hey, typing dead would be awesome if I didn't have to find a keyboard and I could just use a guitar.

730
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:30,179
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

731
00:57:30,199 --> 00:57:37,223
[SPEAKER_02]: But, though, I'll be honest that I had this discussion with someone about them doing another typing of the dead with a different peripheral.

732
00:57:37,583 --> 00:57:39,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I was thinking, you know, drumming of the dead.

733
00:57:40,105 --> 00:57:42,446
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to reiterate, Neil Patrick Harris is awesome.

734
00:57:42,947 --> 00:57:44,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, great for Neil Patrick Harris.

735
00:57:44,448 --> 00:57:46,269
[SPEAKER_07]: He needs, you know, money, too, to pay the bills.

736
00:57:46,349 --> 00:57:49,030
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm sorry, it's still a rip-off.

737
00:57:50,495 --> 00:57:58,961
[SPEAKER_07]: and there's nothing... I mean, it looks exactly like... If this Rock of the Dead came out and they didn't say who made it, who would you think made it?

738
00:57:59,281 --> 00:57:59,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Sega!

739
00:57:59,942 --> 00:58:01,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it sounds like House of the Dead.

740
00:58:01,623 --> 00:58:02,403
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like House of the Dead.

741
00:58:02,423 --> 00:58:03,984
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have said, yeah, Sega's getting funny.

742
00:58:04,365 --> 00:58:05,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, exactly.

743
00:58:05,385 --> 00:58:07,407
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's a rip-off.

744
00:58:07,507 --> 00:58:10,209
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sorry... It's kind of a bummer Sega didn't think of it.

745
00:58:11,505 --> 00:58:16,890
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a bummer, but at the same time, it probably won't make it out, at least not under that name.

746
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:22,415
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give you the honest reason I'm not interested in this game, despite the voice talent behind it, is that I'm not buying a guitar for the Wii.

747
00:58:22,535 --> 00:58:23,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

748
00:58:23,916 --> 00:58:24,977
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have to borrow one.

749
00:58:25,197 --> 00:58:26,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Flailing.

750
00:58:26,358 --> 00:58:27,099
[SPEAKER_02]: I would totally play it.

751
00:58:27,579 --> 00:58:31,082
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought the Dreamcast keyboard for Typing of the Dead.

752
00:58:31,222 --> 00:58:34,545
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Typing of the Dead on Dreamcast, but I would totally play this too on the 360.

753
00:58:36,247 --> 00:58:37,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Flailing of the Dead.

754
00:58:39,781 --> 00:58:42,722
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, did you know that they have the air guitar controller?

755
00:58:43,842 --> 00:58:44,062
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

756
00:58:44,622 --> 00:58:45,542
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw one at Fry's.

757
00:58:45,962 --> 00:58:46,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Sitar of the Dead?

758
00:58:46,902 --> 00:58:49,503
[SPEAKER_12]: No, an air guitar controller.

759
00:58:49,723 --> 00:58:49,943
[SPEAKER_12]: I know.

760
00:58:50,423 --> 00:58:51,403
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy.

761
00:58:51,503 --> 00:58:58,485
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a great idea, more power to them if they're able to launch it without a lawsuit, but I mean, seriously.

762
00:58:58,885 --> 00:59:03,226
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to think, haven't there been like parody games before that were obvious play on titles?

763
00:59:03,266 --> 00:59:09,187
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, granted, there's Dawn of the Dead and stuff like that, Day of the Dead, whatever, but

764
00:59:10,448 --> 00:59:24,880
[SPEAKER_07]: House of the Dead A zombie shooter That had a version that wasn't with a light gun It was with a keyboard And you entered in commands And it killed the zombie This is basically the same thing Except it's a guitar controller And the movie sucked

765
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:25,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Samba de la Muerta

766
00:59:53,396 --> 01:00:22,369
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna maraca the zombies to death I would play the hell out of that I would play the shit out of that game especially if Neil Patrick Harris did a voice you know what Rob maybe we should have that as a side to our LAN party have a maraca booty shaking contest going on in the other room I think Samba de la Muerte should be a dream game I don't know I'm thinking that's we should have that and of course Rod Caliber yeah but Rod Caliber has kind of already been done Samba de la Dead or whatever awesome

767
01:00:24,443 --> 01:00:26,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, boy oh boy.

768
01:00:26,305 --> 01:00:35,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let's take a different direction here in the show and take a look at gaming's past and take a trip down memory lane to figure out what the classic game of the week is.

769
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:44,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Because every week, DarkSakura likes to take a trip to the vault and find a game that she says, hey, you ungrateful kids, you ought to be playing this game.

770
01:00:44,121 --> 01:00:46,503
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, she picked something from the ColecoVision this week, right?

771
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:46,844
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

772
01:00:47,004 --> 01:00:47,264
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

773
01:00:47,404 --> 01:00:47,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe next week.

774
01:00:48,245 --> 01:00:49,566
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, get off my lawn.

775
01:00:50,547 --> 01:00:56,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, she said get off my lawn and then decided Go play this This should be the classic game of the week So what is your classic game of the week, DarkSakura?

776
01:00:56,650 --> 01:01:01,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Doom Doom is the classic game of the week

777
01:01:02,406 --> 01:01:04,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

778
01:01:23,042 --> 01:01:29,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, IDDQD was, I think, God Mode, and then ID Level Skip, and then ID BFG for all the weapons and crap.

779
01:01:30,148 --> 01:01:33,650
[SPEAKER_07]: No, BFG, that was just the big fucking gun.

780
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:34,291
[SPEAKER_02]: The big fucking gun.

781
01:01:34,431 --> 01:01:35,071
[SPEAKER_07]: KFA.

782
01:01:35,351 --> 01:01:35,852
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it.

783
01:01:38,050 --> 01:01:39,011
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

784
01:01:55,306 --> 01:02:05,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there were also, um, this gave us a term that we had before the coining of, you know, first person shooter, I really think.

785
01:02:05,993 --> 01:02:07,254
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was Doom Clone.

786
01:02:07,414 --> 01:02:10,957
[SPEAKER_02]: How often did we use the term Doom Clone back in the day?

787
01:02:12,483 --> 01:02:15,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yes, there were tons of Doom knockoff games though, tons.

788
01:02:15,887 --> 01:02:20,212
[SPEAKER_02]: But from there we had Doom 2 Hell on Earth, and by the way the first Doom came out in 93.

789
01:02:20,272 --> 01:02:23,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Doom 2 was 1994, Ultimate Doom 1995, Master Levels for Doom 2, Final Doom in 1996.

790
01:02:24,276 --> 01:02:25,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Even Doom was copying Doom.

791
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:46,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but now there's also Doom Resurrection that came out last year in June for the iPhone, which I haven't played, but it's a parallel to Doom 3.

792
01:02:47,617 --> 01:02:52,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Doom 4 was stated for being in production, but there's nothing out on it yet.

793
01:02:54,001 --> 01:02:55,903
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's first person.

794
01:02:55,943 --> 01:02:57,444
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get a chainsaw.

795
01:02:57,764 --> 01:02:58,745
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get the BFG.

796
01:03:02,066 --> 01:03:07,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you can, um, there's just all kinds of, like, weird stuff also hidden in the game, too.

797
01:03:07,930 --> 01:03:16,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, like in, uh, Doom 2, you have a bunny called Daisy that's, you know, impaled on a stake, and you have to give vengeance for it and crap.

798
01:03:18,097 --> 01:03:18,918
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um...

799
01:03:20,538 --> 01:03:22,860
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, basically, it's just going through.

800
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:31,445
[SPEAKER_02]: If you play it on the weakest level and then you try to get through to the last level, it doesn't let you play the last level.

801
01:03:31,505 --> 01:03:41,031
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, the screen goes black like you're... But the reason why I'm bringing up Doom is because of the...

802
01:03:42,992 --> 01:03:45,673
[SPEAKER_02]: The home hacks, the wads.

803
01:03:46,713 --> 01:03:47,994
[SPEAKER_02]: All kinds of different versions.

804
01:03:48,114 --> 01:03:50,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's a Ghostbusters one.

805
01:03:50,895 --> 01:03:52,915
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a Gatchaman one.

806
01:03:53,135 --> 01:03:54,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Aliens, Sailor Moon.

807
01:03:54,836 --> 01:03:57,116
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the Dragon Ball Z one back in the day.

808
01:03:58,037 --> 01:04:02,598
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all these people who would just go and, you know, change out the sprites and everything.

809
01:04:02,658 --> 01:04:08,600
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, also, also, the other thing was skipping to the hidden Wolfenstein level.

810
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:15,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Wolfenstein was the game I would mod, not so much Doom, but I had the Mortal Kombat characters for Wolfenstein.

811
01:04:15,645 --> 01:04:17,546
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a lot of fun.

812
01:04:17,606 --> 01:04:22,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I prefer them for Quake, but we had Doom first.

813
01:04:23,770 --> 01:04:33,435
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that Doom is really the reason why we've got just the massive tons of first-person shooters that we have today.

814
01:04:33,695 --> 01:04:35,836
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of want to play this on Xbox Live later.

815
01:04:36,056 --> 01:04:38,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I want to have an epic frag fest on Doom later.

816
01:04:38,857 --> 01:04:43,279
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to play... This is actually the one... This video is from Ultimate Doom.

817
01:04:44,219 --> 01:04:51,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, I played quite a bit of it on the Nintendo 64, but really... This was the game I learned my appreciation for PC gaming on.

818
01:04:51,902 --> 01:04:55,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was from this that I was playing Duke Nukem 3D.

819
01:04:56,704 --> 01:04:58,965
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, where you could do your own voice macros and everything.

820
01:04:59,205 --> 01:05:01,826
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was the game I learned to do deathmatching on.

821
01:05:02,867 --> 01:05:03,147
[SPEAKER_02]: You know...

822
01:05:04,007 --> 01:05:07,209
[SPEAKER_02]: On top of that, I can play Doom without getting motion sick.

823
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:08,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

824
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:10,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's sprite-based.

825
01:05:11,391 --> 01:05:11,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's right.

826
01:05:11,912 --> 01:05:16,134
[SPEAKER_06]: You have the whole, like, sprites don't make you sick, but the real 3D rendering.

827
01:05:16,154 --> 01:05:17,255
[SPEAKER_02]: But polygons do.

828
01:05:17,415 --> 01:05:17,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

829
01:05:18,823 --> 01:05:19,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

830
01:05:35,505 --> 01:05:48,031
[SPEAKER_02]: And going to hang out, this was, no I take that back, 94, my first year of college And going to hang out at my friend Marcy's house playing Doom Playing Doom and Phantasmagoria Do you remember that game?

831
01:05:48,191 --> 01:06:02,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Phantasmagoria just came out on the Good Old Games website this week I don't think it's in tonight's show roll, or I don't remember if we talked about it last week But Phantasmagoria, old is new again Yeah, but you know, we were playing this in Loom, I was playing Loom when I was playing Doom

832
01:06:03,675 --> 01:06:05,116
[SPEAKER_06]: I played a crap load of Doom.

833
01:06:05,156 --> 01:06:10,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I used to call into a BBS that specialized in doing the Doom 2 networking.

834
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,902
[SPEAKER_06]: So you would call into this BBS and you'd do these settings.

835
01:06:12,922 --> 01:06:13,943
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even remember what you had to do.

836
01:06:13,963 --> 01:06:14,623
[SPEAKER_06]: It was so long ago.

837
01:06:14,844 --> 01:06:16,945
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you'd launch Doom 2 and you could actually play.

838
01:06:17,265 --> 01:06:19,167
[SPEAKER_06]: And this BBS would charge.

839
01:06:19,187 --> 01:06:22,169
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd get an hour free and then you had to pay for more hours.

840
01:06:22,469 --> 01:06:26,613
[SPEAKER_06]: So of course we'd keep re-registering new accounts and putting in fake phone numbers and stuff.

841
01:06:26,653 --> 01:06:26,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

842
01:06:27,313 --> 01:06:49,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll tell you, you know, that same year of school, we had our Mac Lab, and keep in mind, it was the old, you know, the big rectangle box, tall Macs with the crappy keyboards and shit, and mine had a black and white version of Doom on it.

843
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:55,633
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so I was playing Doom in black and white in class and getting a D in the class.

844
01:06:55,933 --> 01:07:00,595
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a great game of the week because I think especially for you younger folks out there to listen to the show.

845
01:07:00,635 --> 01:07:05,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I know even though we swear a lot more than we should on this show and so kids should listen to our show.

846
01:07:05,816 --> 01:07:09,097
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's some of you in like that 16 to 17 range that listen to this program.

847
01:07:09,517 --> 01:07:15,219
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're one of those folks, if you want to see what gaming was like when we were 16, I mean not to be all like...

848
01:07:16,059 --> 01:07:18,081
[SPEAKER_06]: I walked uphill back where I was.

849
01:07:18,101 --> 01:07:18,801
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's face it.

850
01:07:18,821 --> 01:07:19,682
[SPEAKER_12]: I walked uphill both ways.

851
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:21,843
[SPEAKER_06]: We're getting old because we've been doing this show for eight years.

852
01:07:21,863 --> 01:07:22,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Speak for yourself.

853
01:07:23,505 --> 01:07:24,345
[SPEAKER_02]: I still get carded.

854
01:07:24,485 --> 01:07:26,066
[SPEAKER_06]: This was the game I would play when I was 16.

855
01:07:26,887 --> 01:07:31,851
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to see a real game that we grew up on and loved, Doom is a great example.

856
01:07:31,931 --> 01:07:35,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're making me feel old because I was in college when I was playing Doom.

857
01:07:36,254 --> 01:07:38,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Doom came out when I was in 11th grade.

858
01:07:38,475 --> 01:07:38,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

859
01:07:38,796 --> 01:07:42,458
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was playing it more when I was out of... It aged.

860
01:07:42,478 --> 01:07:43,119
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have... I had an...

861
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:49,463
[SPEAKER_02]: My computer that I had was a TI and I had a Clico Atom.

862
01:07:50,324 --> 01:07:52,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I would use the school's Apple IIe.

863
01:07:52,305 --> 01:07:59,330
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have my own computer until, you know, at least a regular use computer until Light 95 and I was on AOL 1.5 on DOS.

864
01:08:02,432 --> 01:08:03,994
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to read this in chat real quick.

865
01:08:04,054 --> 01:08:05,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob D's commenting on what I said there.

866
01:08:06,016 --> 01:08:08,719
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm almost 23, but I played all this stuff when I was younger.

867
01:08:08,839 --> 01:08:11,042
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he links a screenshot from ZZT.

868
01:08:11,362 --> 01:08:15,287
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to take a moment to say hail ZZT, one of the greatest PC games of all freaking time.

869
01:08:15,707 --> 01:08:16,168
[SPEAKER_06]: We miss you.

870
01:08:17,938 --> 01:08:43,531
[SPEAKER_02]: but I do have to make a mention of it that Doom is actually one of the games that led up to one of my favorite wads and it wasn't it actually wasn't Doom but it was a Quake one but I first played a version of it on Doom and then found a much better one for Quake was Gacha Quake which was a full on fully redone Gachamon Quake

871
01:08:45,012 --> 01:08:54,196
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, Doom was like my thing Doom is awesome Yeah, for anyone who hasn't played it God, what planet have you been living on?

872
01:08:54,757 --> 01:09:12,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Bochikawa in our chatroom says Doom is seriously one of the best games to have lasted for this long Wow And like I was saying before And it even had a crappy movie If you are one of those younger folks that didn't get to experience this when you were a teen or whatever Seriously, go on Xbox Live and check it out

873
01:09:12,645 --> 01:09:13,145
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

874
01:09:37,422 --> 01:09:40,104
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a challenge then.

875
01:09:40,144 --> 01:09:41,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go ahead and revive the Doomwad.

876
01:09:42,766 --> 01:09:44,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Doomwad, that's great.

877
01:09:44,767 --> 01:09:46,308
[SPEAKER_02]: I want someone to make OLR Doom.

878
01:09:46,428 --> 01:09:47,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck.

879
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:48,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Those things take a lot of work.

880
01:09:49,871 --> 01:09:51,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone made us a text-based game.

881
01:09:51,812 --> 01:09:52,293
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

882
01:09:52,413 --> 01:09:53,754
[SPEAKER_02]: We can have an OLR Doom.

883
01:09:53,894 --> 01:09:55,035
[SPEAKER_06]: I want OLR Doom.

884
01:09:55,055 --> 01:09:56,376
[SPEAKER_06]: The text game was pretty awesome.

885
01:09:56,816 --> 01:09:57,576
[SPEAKER_02]: OLR Doom.

886
01:09:58,877 --> 01:09:59,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it.

887
01:09:59,257 --> 01:10:02,438
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I want to see my face melting and getting shot.

888
01:10:02,478 --> 01:10:03,759
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we don't use our faces.

889
01:10:03,919 --> 01:10:04,619
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be themed.

890
01:10:04,639 --> 01:10:06,220
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to be the ones with the gun.

891
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:09,561
[SPEAKER_02]: We're the ones with the gun, and whoever wins gets a hat homemade by me.

892
01:10:09,922 --> 01:10:10,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

893
01:10:10,622 --> 01:10:12,743
[SPEAKER_06]: And you guys know who the various enemies of OLR are.

894
01:10:12,863 --> 01:10:14,904
[SPEAKER_06]: You can put them in there.

895
01:10:14,924 --> 01:10:18,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Ken Kudragi will be in there with a bicycle helmet and crayons.

896
01:10:22,341 --> 01:10:24,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Some folks in chat saying, oh, Zen Thrall Zen, there it is.

897
01:10:24,744 --> 01:10:25,926
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Rob, I've tried.

898
01:10:25,986 --> 01:10:27,188
[SPEAKER_06]: I was hoping for the same thing.

899
01:10:28,109 --> 01:10:28,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Fail.

900
01:10:29,531 --> 01:10:32,095
[SPEAKER_06]: So sadly, you cannot do the keyboard on Xbox Arcade.

901
01:10:33,052 --> 01:10:36,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so that's going to do it for the Classic Game of the Week, but that was a darn good one.

902
01:10:36,554 --> 01:10:36,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job.

903
01:10:37,875 --> 01:10:39,596
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I'm awesome.

904
01:10:39,676 --> 01:10:43,378
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to take a quick break here at OLR Headquarters, but don't go anywhere.

905
01:10:43,418 --> 01:10:56,145
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be right back with Part B, a lot of quick news tonight in Part B, as well as some news about another video game movie, Sonic 4, more details, Blur, a racing game I'm looking forward to, and a few more details on Game Room.

906
01:10:56,185 --> 01:10:59,447
[SPEAKER_06]: And are we looking at Wii's being hard to find all over again?

907
01:10:59,687 --> 01:11:01,875
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to talk about that in part B. So don't go anywhere.

908
01:11:01,935 --> 01:11:05,268
[SPEAKER_06]: We will be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

909
01:11:11,753 --> 01:11:17,639
[SPEAKER_06]: And welcome back everybody to more of Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday night, February the 14th of 2009.

910
01:11:17,719 --> 01:11:21,744
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time for part B of our episode number 355.

911
01:11:22,264 --> 01:11:29,692
[SPEAKER_06]: During the break there, we were playing some classic 8-bit songs and unfortunately you don't hear our break music on the podcast because, you know, copyright issues and all that.

912
01:11:30,072 --> 01:11:55,588
[SPEAKER_06]: but um we were playing some 8-bit songs for our uh chatters and they were kind of guessing and we had some uh let me let me just quickly name you the playlist we had because you know they're only about a minute long the NES songs were weren't that long so we did a lot of them we did a Battle of Olympus, Dr. Mario, Guardian Legend, Fashanadu, uh Kid Icarus, Crystallis, Goonies 2, Balloon Fight and then what I thought was a really tricky one Magic of Scheherazade, the town music that was a old school NES game I really liked it was kind of like

913
01:11:56,168 --> 01:12:23,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Zelda and an RPG like mixed together it was weird and then of course Metroid we had some requests in chat like I think some folks want to hear StarTropics and I saw a shout out for DuckTales too we'll try to get those at the end for our live listeners unfortunately you guys who are listening to us in the podcast we for copyright reasons can't do that although what I can do I can I can play the music and then talk over it so that's this is the magic of Scheherazade music and then I want to play like a little clip there so there you go

914
01:12:24,428 --> 01:12:25,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone remember that game?

915
01:12:25,449 --> 01:12:25,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone?

916
01:12:26,150 --> 01:12:26,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone?

917
01:12:26,791 --> 01:12:27,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone remember playing it?

918
01:12:28,052 --> 01:12:30,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, that's not even on virtual console.

919
01:12:30,594 --> 01:12:34,238
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the developer who made that game probably doesn't exist anymore.

920
01:12:34,258 --> 01:12:35,179
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't even remember who made that.

921
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:36,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that the Culture Brain?

922
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:37,701
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't even remember.

923
01:12:37,981 --> 01:12:45,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyhow, let's get into some rapid fire news tonight and then we're going to get into Twitter topics as well.

924
01:12:46,189 --> 01:12:48,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag coming up this segment as well.

925
01:12:48,231 --> 01:12:48,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, start us off.

926
01:12:49,432 --> 01:12:50,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you like free stuff?

927
01:12:50,893 --> 01:12:53,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Because everybody does.

928
01:12:53,514 --> 01:12:53,814
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

929
01:12:53,994 --> 01:12:54,734
[SPEAKER_07]: I like free stuff.

930
01:12:55,374 --> 01:13:01,476
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the things that you can look forward to free is the old Command & Conquer games.

931
01:13:01,596 --> 01:13:02,137
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

932
01:13:02,297 --> 01:13:07,158
[SPEAKER_07]: EA is now offering Command & Conquer Classics, which are free to download.

933
01:13:07,879 --> 01:13:10,800
[SPEAKER_07]: And they are including...

934
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:17,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Tiberium Dawn, Tiberium Sun with the Firestorm expansion pack, and my personal favorite, Red Alert.

935
01:13:18,725 --> 01:13:28,191
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, I guess apparently they are easy to download, but to get them running with your modern computers, it may be a little bit tricky.

936
01:13:28,992 --> 01:13:31,033
[SPEAKER_07]: So keep that in mind.

937
01:13:31,533 --> 01:13:40,499
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're looking to download those, apparently Big Download is the website that will have those available.

938
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:48,465
[SPEAKER_07]: BigDownload.com Some other cool stuff, of course, the LEGO Star Wars games, very popular.

939
01:13:48,805 --> 01:13:51,107
[SPEAKER_07]: And you may be thinking, hey, what's going to happen?

940
01:13:51,147 --> 01:13:52,788
[SPEAKER_07]: And what are they going to do for the third one?

941
01:13:52,828 --> 01:13:56,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Since obviously they've ran out of the Star Wars movies.

942
01:13:57,011 --> 01:14:02,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, not exactly, because the third LEGO Star Wars game will actually follow the Clone Wars.

943
01:14:03,156 --> 01:14:05,798
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm assuming the movie and maybe the TV series.

944
01:14:06,238 --> 01:14:13,761
[SPEAKER_07]: It's scheduled to come out later this year, probably in the fall, just in time for holidays, and on all your favorite platforms except for the PlayStation 2.

945
01:14:14,941 --> 01:14:20,123
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're seeing some brand new battle modes, also some head-to-head combat as well.

946
01:14:20,883 --> 01:14:25,885
[SPEAKER_07]: The level editor from Indiana Jones 2 will be coming back as well.

947
01:14:26,725 --> 01:14:33,127
[SPEAKER_07]: And just some new squad commands, lightsaber slicing, lightsaber jumps.

948
01:14:33,767 --> 01:14:37,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Long Distance Jedi Attacks, and Grapple Tie-Ups and whatnot.

949
01:14:38,471 --> 01:14:39,172
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of cool.

950
01:14:40,132 --> 01:14:43,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though I'm not really a fan of the Clone Wars series.

951
01:14:44,216 --> 01:14:44,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh well.

952
01:14:45,357 --> 01:14:47,338
[SPEAKER_07]: And then finally, L.A.

953
01:14:47,418 --> 01:14:55,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Noire, a game that is coming from Rockstar, will be making its way out this year in September.

954
01:14:55,925 --> 01:14:58,548
[SPEAKER_07]: It is, of course, kind of a crime drama game.

955
01:14:59,649 --> 01:15:10,902
[SPEAKER_07]: brought to you by the folks that put out Grand Theft Auto and what once was a PlayStation 3 exclusive is now of course coming out on both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

956
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,781
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that is it.

957
01:15:42,797 --> 01:15:43,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, how do you know this for sure?

958
01:15:44,097 --> 01:15:50,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Because this is somewhat of a bombshell to be dropping and part B of our show, which a lot of people probably don't listen long enough to get to.

959
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:53,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Just listening from Square.

960
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:56,801
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm sure they'll announce it soon at some point.

961
01:15:57,142 --> 01:15:58,962
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know when the game's coming out right now.

962
01:15:59,002 --> 01:16:05,124
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still scheduled around... Do you think or do you have anything that indicates to you that it's going to be simultaneous with PS3?

963
01:16:05,144 --> 01:16:06,564
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be the same time.

964
01:16:07,065 --> 01:16:07,865
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be the same time.

965
01:16:08,625 --> 01:16:15,227
[SPEAKER_07]: but right now it's all kind of we don't even know exactly for sure when it's coming out.

966
01:16:16,667 --> 01:16:19,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now it's kind of hovering around June but that stuff gets delayed all the time.

967
01:16:20,228 --> 01:16:23,389
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a nice little bombshell to tuck there in rapid fire news.

968
01:16:23,449 --> 01:16:34,092
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's just because we were talking about exclusives so I mean I don't know, it makes sense because they're going to sell a hell of a lot of Final Fantasy XIII on 360 so I'm not surprised.

969
01:16:34,918 --> 01:16:37,841
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, gee, it makes my iPhone stories look a little silly, but I'll try.

970
01:16:54,981 --> 01:16:55,541
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

971
01:17:14,747 --> 01:17:17,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Apogee's Rise of the Triad is coming to the iPhone.

972
01:17:33,936 --> 01:18:02,956
[SPEAKER_06]: and also big bombshell on the iPhone Plants vs. Zombies because Pop Crack, you know they put out a lot of addicting games Plants vs. Zombies has a date which seems strange because Apple games don't usually get dated because it's just kind of you're at Apple's mercy but for whatever reason PopCap has said it is coming out on the handheld February 15th that would be tomorrow or if you're listening on the podcast probably today or yesterday so Plants vs. Zombies on February 15th on the iPhone

973
01:18:03,896 --> 01:18:04,657
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go, DarkSakra.

974
01:18:16,918 --> 01:18:19,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, that perhaps Dudley will be in Street Fighter 4.

975
01:18:19,959 --> 01:18:22,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Super Street Fighter 4, I should say.

976
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:24,861
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be pretty cool.

977
01:18:25,541 --> 01:18:27,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though I never used him and thought he sucked.

978
01:18:27,742 --> 01:18:29,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Although people are infuriating using him.

979
01:18:30,683 --> 01:18:34,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Mega Man 10 will have a March release.

980
01:18:37,925 --> 01:18:39,766
[SPEAKER_02]: We will have it after...

981
01:18:42,507 --> 01:18:48,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, the WiiWare version will be March 1st, PlayStation 3 will be March 11th, and Xbox 360 will be March 31st.

982
01:18:49,651 --> 01:18:55,654
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, in that batch, Rock Band is going to be getting some new tracks.

983
01:18:56,515 --> 01:19:01,878
[SPEAKER_02]: An Otis Redding track pack, which is Sitting on the Dock of the Bay, the fa-fa-fa-fa-fa sad song.

984
01:19:02,618 --> 01:19:18,865
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sick y'all I got dreams to remember and love man and then some individual tracks all time low weightless alpha beat fascination buyer sets orchestra stray cat strut that's such a cool song and the chemical brothers let forever be and they're also available for lego rock band

985
01:19:20,791 --> 01:19:23,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, how about some Twitter topics then?

986
01:19:23,312 --> 01:19:27,795
[SPEAKER_06]: If we're all done with the rapid fire stuff tonight, let's get into some Twitter topics.

987
01:19:27,935 --> 01:19:35,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, our computer is acting up right now and I can't even access the theme music because it's being rude.

988
01:19:36,419 --> 01:19:38,060
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if our feed just went down.

989
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:41,162
[SPEAKER_06]: We did go down.

990
01:19:42,102 --> 01:19:42,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we down?

991
01:19:43,603 --> 01:19:44,083
[SPEAKER_06]: We're down.

992
01:19:44,123 --> 01:19:45,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, hold on guys.

993
01:19:45,464 --> 01:19:49,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Those of you listening on the podcast, we need to go ahead and just bring our feed right back up.

994
01:19:56,266 --> 01:19:56,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we're back.

995
01:19:56,947 --> 01:20:01,229
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a little bit of a live stream difficulty there, so we lost all of our listeners there for a minute.

996
01:20:01,389 --> 01:20:04,011
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why, but Winamp decided to crash on us.

997
01:20:04,552 --> 01:20:09,915
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's kind of an important program when we're trying to broadcast, because we use Shoutcast to send our feed over to the all-game servers.

998
01:20:10,295 --> 01:20:18,761
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we left off with the show, Jamie had just finished up her last little rapid-fire stories, talking about the Rock Band releases for the week.

999
01:20:18,801 --> 01:20:22,684
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if our live listeners got to hear that, but we know it's saved for the podcast.

1000
01:20:23,024 --> 01:20:26,006
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to move on now and move into some Twitter topics.

1001
01:20:30,108 --> 01:20:47,215
[SPEAKER_06]: of course every week we invite your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR we got a lot tonight so I apologize if I don't get to your tweet but we just have kind of a lot tonight so especially if you sent multiple tweets probably only going to read one okay TigerClaw305 sends us a tweet that says game teaches

1002
01:20:48,445 --> 01:20:50,686
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know if I should say this with a child in the room.

1003
01:20:52,467 --> 01:20:56,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Game teaches S-E-X through the eyes of a superhero.

1004
01:20:57,070 --> 01:21:04,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, Jillian would walk into the room right as I'm starting to read this story here.

1005
01:21:05,495 --> 01:21:05,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Awkward.

1006
01:21:06,395 --> 01:21:09,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so a game teaches SEX through the eyes of a superhero.

1007
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:22,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently health officials in Ontario, Canada, are talking about a new video game launched Thursday that will help teenagers learn about sex through the eyes of a superhero.

1008
01:21:22,133 --> 01:21:22,914
[SPEAKER_06]: He left the room, it's okay.

1009
01:21:23,655 --> 01:21:27,680
[SPEAKER_06]: This is an online game, ironically, by the Middlesex London Health Unit.

1010
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:32,505
[SPEAKER_06]: It gets a player to choose a character and answer true or false questions about their activity.

1011
01:21:33,086 --> 01:21:38,853
[SPEAKER_06]: You can either be a man named Captain Condom, a virgin named Wonder Badge,

1012
01:21:39,654 --> 01:21:46,377
[SPEAKER_06]: or a boy named Willie the Kid who believes size doesn't matter or PowerPap, a sexually active gal.

1013
01:21:47,118 --> 01:21:48,759
[SPEAKER_06]: This is worth it just for the names alone.

1014
01:21:49,459 --> 01:21:58,023
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to fight the game's supervillain, the Sperminator, who's a muscular man wearing a red wrestling mask with, of course, penis arms, by correctly answering a number of questions.

1015
01:21:58,063 --> 01:22:00,484
[SPEAKER_06]: If you get an answer wrong, you get shot by sperm.

1016
01:22:00,524 --> 01:22:02,125
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell kind of game is this?

1017
01:22:02,145 --> 01:22:03,486
[SPEAKER_06]: The tiger called Link to us.

1018
01:22:03,826 --> 01:22:05,227
[SPEAKER_06]: This is disgusting.

1019
01:22:07,428 --> 01:22:09,791
[SPEAKER_06]: www.getitonlondon.com

1020
01:22:26,286 --> 01:22:27,086
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1021
01:22:52,619 --> 01:22:54,040
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100, Matt linked us to this.

1022
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:58,882
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if any of you guys saw that new We Are The World video for the 25th anniversary or whatever.

1023
01:22:59,022 --> 01:22:59,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Refuse.

1024
01:23:00,023 --> 01:23:01,383
[SPEAKER_06]: It was awful.

1025
01:23:01,663 --> 01:23:03,024
[SPEAKER_06]: It is awful.

1026
01:23:03,104 --> 01:23:14,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Michael Jackson, seriously, if I were him, I would rise from the grave and slap, who's that guy, Lil Wayne or whatever, in the face for using auto-tune in a disgusting way on that song.

1027
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:16,510
[SPEAKER_05]: He used auto-tune on that song?

1028
01:23:16,550 --> 01:23:17,451
[SPEAKER_06]: It was bad.

1029
01:23:18,371 --> 01:23:19,893
[SPEAKER_06]: and just, it is bad.

1030
01:23:20,253 --> 01:23:21,074
[SPEAKER_06]: It was so bad.

1031
01:23:21,174 --> 01:23:22,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we just know he can't sing.

1032
01:23:22,455 --> 01:23:22,895
[SPEAKER_06]: It was so bad.

1033
01:23:22,915 --> 01:23:23,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, seriously?

1034
01:23:24,036 --> 01:23:28,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I'm all for, you know, supporting charities and all that, but don't do it through this organization.

1035
01:23:29,141 --> 01:23:33,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, just donate to the Red Cross or donate to one of the Haiti relief organizations.

1036
01:23:33,465 --> 01:23:36,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't make these celebrities think they actually helped because they didn't.

1037
01:23:37,089 --> 01:23:37,950
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my take on it.

1038
01:23:37,970 --> 01:23:38,370
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

1039
01:23:38,450 --> 01:23:43,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually did buy the Haiti, Help Haiti, whatever.

1040
01:23:43,675 --> 01:23:46,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I did the little text message too when they did the telethon and so forth.

1041
01:23:46,737 --> 01:23:48,678
[SPEAKER_02]: I downloaded the album on Amazon.

1042
01:23:48,698 --> 01:23:49,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

1043
01:23:49,598 --> 01:23:54,260
[SPEAKER_02]: And Shakira is not allowed to cover The Pretenders ever.

1044
01:23:56,141 --> 01:23:56,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Never.

1045
01:23:56,782 --> 01:24:00,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, SSJ100Matt didn't want us to just talk about that.

1046
01:24:00,344 --> 01:24:05,106
[SPEAKER_06]: They wanted us to mention that somebody in the video, and you can't really see who because it's obscured, but it's circled here.

1047
01:24:05,126 --> 01:24:08,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this is actually because they're showing clips of, I believe, this is Haiti at this point.

1048
01:24:08,728 --> 01:24:10,969
[SPEAKER_06]: You actually can see somebody's wearing a Fatal Fury hat.

1049
01:24:12,930 --> 01:24:15,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Rock Band DLC will be more selective in the future.

1050
01:24:33,127 --> 01:24:53,520
[SPEAKER_06]: hmm so apparently they're going to start to scale back maybe some of the stuff that you know because they put a lot of stuff on there maybe they're just finally realizing they're not selling as much as they used to and that there's a lot of tracks that maybe just aren't worthy of being on rock band maybe because they have the rock band network now they can kind of screen through a lot of stuff I don't know

1051
01:24:54,986 --> 01:24:55,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1052
01:24:55,987 --> 01:25:00,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Master of the Claw linked us to a YouTube, but I can't pull it up in studio because it'll be too quick here.

1053
01:25:00,770 --> 01:25:02,651
[SPEAKER_06]: But it says this relates to Typing of the Dead.

1054
01:25:02,671 --> 01:25:05,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently there was a PC guitar battling game from 1995, but it is a short clip.

1055
01:25:09,083 --> 01:25:16,305
[SPEAKER_06]: And then lastly here from Spazinator, PSN, which is better, local or online multiplayer?

1056
01:25:16,526 --> 01:25:20,347
[SPEAKER_06]: I say online for one reason, the no pants rule, LOL.

1057
01:25:21,307 --> 01:25:23,508
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't know, Loki, what do you think?

1058
01:25:23,588 --> 01:25:25,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Is local or online gaming better?

1059
01:25:25,788 --> 01:25:27,129
[SPEAKER_06]: I would prefer local.

1060
01:25:27,549 --> 01:25:28,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

1061
01:25:43,493 --> 01:26:03,256
[SPEAKER_07]: and we found out why our network is so laggy it's because we have these wonderful or I should say it was a wonderful use of company money we have these photo frames on all of our desks that pull pictures off of a website that have little event pictures from our work and stuff the web shots

1062
01:26:03,656 --> 01:26:06,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and they all suck bandwidth.

1063
01:26:07,058 --> 01:26:12,900
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we have like Xbox Live disconnects all the freaking time just from those stupid things.

1064
01:26:13,060 --> 01:26:14,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Thankfully, they're fixing it.

1065
01:26:14,441 --> 01:26:19,543
[SPEAKER_07]: But still, you know, that's why I do like System Link for that kind of stuff.

1066
01:26:19,584 --> 01:26:24,306
[SPEAKER_07]: And I kind of wish Grand Theft Auto had System Link because if that was the case, we'd be still playing our modded games.

1067
01:26:25,206 --> 01:26:30,290
[SPEAKER_06]: I prefer local multiplayer, but I really like online multiplayer when local multiplayer is impossible.

1068
01:26:31,190 --> 01:26:38,575
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, I think I've said this on the show before, my boyfriend lives two hours away, so during the week we can't really just drive out and see each other one night.

1069
01:26:38,915 --> 01:26:46,721
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the weekends we'll play Castle Crashers or something together, but during the week we play WoW online.

1070
01:26:46,781 --> 01:26:50,623
[SPEAKER_06]: So I like online gaming for when in real life it's impossible.

1071
01:26:52,745 --> 01:26:53,145
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1072
01:26:53,185 --> 01:26:54,686
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the last question for tonight.

1073
01:26:55,446 --> 01:27:23,152
[SPEAKER_06]: more Twitter topics next week at twitter.com slash OLR let's get back into some more news stories we'll start off with Loki yes I'm sorry can I throw this out here real quick I'm sorry Actdeft wanted to append his tweet saying that the Rock Band article goes on to talk about how the fees that the record labels are charging for the music being on Rock Band is probably leading to them being more selective which if the record companies are going to get greedy with what ends up being promotion for their own stuff

1074
01:27:24,492 --> 01:27:26,414
[SPEAKER_06]: I say let him get what's coming to him.

1075
01:27:27,175 --> 01:27:28,516
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is Rock Band turning him down.

1076
01:27:30,258 --> 01:27:30,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, sorry, Loki.

1077
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:32,501
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all right.

1078
01:27:33,722 --> 01:27:39,808
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's hard to believe that even though the Wii's been out for almost three years now that...

1079
01:27:41,710 --> 01:27:43,271
[SPEAKER_07]: There's still shortages, apparently.

1080
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:48,937
[SPEAKER_07]: And some of the retailers are saying that the demand is still outpacing the supply.

1081
01:27:49,657 --> 01:27:58,065
[SPEAKER_07]: And a bunch of different retailers, including GameStop, Amazon, and Newegg, have all been having issues keeping the wheat in stock.

1082
01:27:58,245 --> 01:28:03,550
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently, orders from Nintendo are just not coming in in a timely manner.

1083
01:28:04,111 --> 01:28:05,932
[SPEAKER_07]: And Nintendo is saying, well...

1084
01:28:06,593 --> 01:28:11,456
[SPEAKER_07]: The replenishing the Wii supply will be a challenge.

1085
01:28:11,516 --> 01:28:23,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, in the short term, replenishing the Wii inventories will be a challenge, but we're doing everything we can to satisfy consumers looking for Wii to purchase.

1086
01:28:26,445 --> 01:28:40,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, I guess December, it was thought that Nintendo had actually reduced Wii production going into the holiday, is from a report in December.

1087
01:28:41,032 --> 01:28:45,295
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you see, here's the problem I have with this, is that...

1088
01:28:46,635 --> 01:28:50,678
[SPEAKER_07]: They always say, oh, we're having trouble making the Wii's and stuff like that.

1089
01:28:51,459 --> 01:28:52,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

1090
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:54,061
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like three years later.

1091
01:28:54,121 --> 01:28:54,962
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't buy it either.

1092
01:28:55,002 --> 01:29:00,366
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not believing that any of those shortages from before are even... I think they were all manufactured.

1093
01:29:00,446 --> 01:29:01,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, this is a shortage now.

1094
01:29:01,987 --> 01:29:03,548
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't put out a console.

1095
01:29:04,348 --> 01:29:08,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Why aren't you putting out tons and tons and tons of consoles out there in the market?

1096
01:29:08,071 --> 01:29:08,331
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

1097
01:29:09,332 --> 01:29:12,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you afraid that people are just going to find them everywhere and now they're not going to want them?

1098
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:14,864
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't understand.

1099
01:29:14,904 --> 01:29:18,351
[SPEAKER_07]: If your console is that good, then what's the problem with having a good supply of them?

1100
01:29:19,682 --> 01:29:23,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I know, because you need to create this artificial shortage so everyone scrambles for them.

1101
01:29:23,845 --> 01:29:25,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Something's up, too, and I'm calling them on it.

1102
01:29:26,147 --> 01:29:30,830
[SPEAKER_06]: This is stupid that it's like three years out and they're still having these bad shortages.

1103
01:29:31,191 --> 01:29:31,671
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1104
01:29:31,711 --> 01:29:32,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Then don't buy a Wii.

1105
01:29:33,733 --> 01:29:35,634
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can't find a Wii, maybe you shouldn't buy one.

1106
01:29:35,694 --> 01:29:37,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Go out and get a 360 or a PS3.

1107
01:29:37,495 --> 01:29:39,357
[SPEAKER_06]: They're both much more reasonable than they were before.

1108
01:29:40,802 --> 01:29:41,783
[SPEAKER_06]: James Burt

1109
01:30:04,139 --> 01:30:05,401
[SPEAKER_06]: and he was 24 years old.

1110
01:30:05,481 --> 01:30:12,329
[SPEAKER_06]: He illegally uploaded New Super Mario Brothers Wii to the internet and thanks to a current affair in Australia, I guess, profiled him.

1111
01:30:12,689 --> 01:30:18,115
[SPEAKER_06]: He did this whole little interview there and they asked him, did you admit that what you did was quite stupid?

1112
01:30:19,316 --> 01:30:23,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, Nintendo Australia is claiming that the upload of New Super Mario Bros.

1113
01:30:23,139 --> 01:30:26,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii was snatched 50,000 times.

1114
01:30:27,581 --> 01:30:36,286
[SPEAKER_06]: He got a copy from somebody who broke the street date on the game and basically saying the folks at Nintendo, it's no different than stealing anything else.

1115
01:30:37,407 --> 01:30:43,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, let's see, James Burt will have to pay a $1.5 million fine in Australian dollars.

1116
01:30:43,231 --> 01:30:44,632
[SPEAKER_06]: That's about $1.3 million US.

1117
01:30:44,652 --> 01:30:46,333
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a settlement, by the way, too.

1118
01:30:46,353 --> 01:30:46,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

1119
01:30:48,213 --> 01:30:51,054
[SPEAKER_06]: He says it's something he's going to have to work through for the rest of my life.

1120
01:30:51,074 --> 01:30:51,975
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a quote there.

1121
01:30:52,695 --> 01:30:55,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's what you get for uploading stuff to the internet.

1122
01:30:55,816 --> 01:30:58,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Downloading, they never seem to go after those people.

1123
01:30:58,937 --> 01:31:01,538
[SPEAKER_07]: But uploaders, man, those are the guys that they go after.

1124
01:31:01,558 --> 01:31:02,078
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1125
01:31:02,118 --> 01:31:03,418
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't want to be the one that gets caught.

1126
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:04,399
[SPEAKER_06]: So remember what they say.

1127
01:31:04,479 --> 01:31:05,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't copy that floppy.

1128
01:31:06,819 --> 01:31:07,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't worry.

1129
01:31:07,139 --> 01:31:08,200
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not copying the floppies.

1130
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:10,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, you know what?

1131
01:31:11,001 --> 01:31:11,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Be careful.

1132
01:31:13,410 --> 01:31:17,733
[SPEAKER_06]: But you do admit, when you copy games like that, you are breaking the law.

1133
01:31:18,113 --> 01:31:21,895
[SPEAKER_06]: You are copying something that's, you know, not supposed to be copied.

1134
01:31:22,736 --> 01:31:24,337
[SPEAKER_06]: There's really no nice way of putting it.

1135
01:31:24,497 --> 01:31:28,259
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're not, I mean... Is it a Robin Hood, steal for the rich, give to the poor thing?

1136
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:31,001
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, that's an ethical question, but it is stealing.

1137
01:31:31,901 --> 01:31:32,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really.

1138
01:31:32,662 --> 01:31:33,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Not by the definition of stealing.

1139
01:31:34,004 --> 01:31:37,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Stealing means that possession is moved from one object to another.

1140
01:31:38,569 --> 01:31:46,659
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, if you have a car stereo in your car and I somehow manage to duplicate that car stereo, you still have your car stereo.

1141
01:31:47,380 --> 01:31:48,802
[SPEAKER_06]: But now I have your car stereo.

1142
01:31:50,518 --> 01:31:51,079
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1143
01:32:13,397 --> 01:32:18,799
[SPEAKER_07]: I do feel bad for Nintendo, and this is why they're unable to put out those Nintendo systems.

1144
01:32:18,859 --> 01:32:22,901
[SPEAKER_07]: If only they had sold 50,000 copies more of New Super Mario Bros.

1145
01:32:22,961 --> 01:32:26,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Wii in Australia, the world would be a better place.

1146
01:32:26,943 --> 01:32:27,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Wiis would be plentiful.

1147
01:32:28,003 --> 01:32:28,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone would be happy.

1148
01:32:29,083 --> 01:32:33,425
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of times, though, I bet of those 50,000 people, they wouldn't have bought the game.

1149
01:32:33,645 --> 01:32:34,906
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's the one thing I will say.

1150
01:32:35,386 --> 01:32:40,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe of the 50,000, like, 500 ever actually planned on buying the game.

1151
01:32:41,609 --> 01:32:44,231
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people want to download stuff because it's free.

1152
01:32:44,931 --> 01:32:53,378
[SPEAKER_06]: There's lots of people that download CDs that are like, oh, I don't know if I'd ever really listen to this, but hey, since I have an opportunity, I'll check this out.

1153
01:32:54,068 --> 01:32:58,589
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually buy CDs and individual tracks off Amazon all the time.

1154
01:32:59,290 --> 01:33:05,311
[SPEAKER_06]: I buy iTunes and regular CDs once in a while too, but what I cannot stand is import.

1155
01:33:05,351 --> 01:33:10,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Very recently, I'll admit, I downloaded a CD, but that's because the CD's not out here, but it's out in another country.

1156
01:33:10,833 --> 01:33:17,155
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll support the artists when they're finally released here, but in the meantime... If it's what I'm thinking of, I'm totally planning on getting that.

1157
01:33:17,255 --> 01:33:18,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is what you're thinking.

1158
01:33:19,115 --> 01:33:25,299
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, I actually almost laid down $30 to import an Angela Aki CD, so I was close.

1159
01:33:25,540 --> 01:33:26,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let me put it this way.

1160
01:33:27,061 --> 01:33:29,362
[SPEAKER_06]: I think people need to realize it's a worldwide market now.

1161
01:33:30,183 --> 01:33:39,789
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that it is technically theft, but it's one of those, I guess you would say, it's not really a harmless crime, but it's

1162
01:33:42,129 --> 01:33:42,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Victimless?

1163
01:33:43,049 --> 01:33:44,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Victimless, I guess.

1164
01:33:44,210 --> 01:33:44,610
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1165
01:33:44,690 --> 01:33:47,510
[SPEAKER_07]: But you would see, I guess you could say that development houses are victims.

1166
01:33:47,530 --> 01:33:51,111
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I was going to say, how many development houses did Activision shut down this week?

1167
01:33:51,131 --> 01:33:51,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay, come on.

1168
01:33:51,851 --> 01:33:53,512
[SPEAKER_07]: That is not because of piracy.

1169
01:33:53,552 --> 01:33:57,713
[SPEAKER_07]: That is because they're stupid and put out 50,000 different Guitar Hero games.

1170
01:33:58,413 --> 01:33:59,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, boo fucking hoo.

1171
01:34:00,253 --> 01:34:02,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, you know, those guys got paid for making the games that they did.

1172
01:34:03,174 --> 01:34:03,834
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know what?

1173
01:34:03,854 --> 01:34:09,576
[SPEAKER_07]: The one development house put out the really shitty Transformers games, so I don't feel bad for them at all.

1174
01:34:09,976 --> 01:34:11,376
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Lux of Flux.

1175
01:34:11,676 --> 01:34:11,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Vigilante 8

1176
01:34:36,397 --> 01:34:38,900
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all that it comes down to.

1177
01:34:39,741 --> 01:34:51,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'm just being naive, but I don't pirate console games because A, I'd rather have the real thing, and B, it's kind of a pain in the ass to do.

1178
01:34:52,275 --> 01:34:55,759
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually easier for me to use something legitimate like Gamefly.

1179
01:34:56,886 --> 01:34:59,628
[SPEAKER_07]: I could if I wanted to, but I have too many games I'm playing now.

1180
01:34:59,748 --> 01:35:05,393
[SPEAKER_07]: So why would I bother downloading and burning off a game to just sit?

1181
01:35:06,734 --> 01:35:07,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, good.

1182
01:35:07,295 --> 01:35:15,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, I have a whole stack of games I could be playing, but I don't have time because I'm playing Borderlands or I'm playing Bioshock 2.

1183
01:35:16,402 --> 01:35:19,365
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just I don't have time for that stuff.

1184
01:35:19,802 --> 01:35:23,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, the views and opinions expressed by the host do not necessarily... Alright, anyway.

1185
01:35:23,425 --> 01:35:26,607
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you want to express your opinion, we'll take emails.

1186
01:35:26,627 --> 01:35:30,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com I'm sure some people are sitting there wanting to say their piece.

1187
01:35:31,250 --> 01:35:34,252
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm sure we'll hear more about this next week.

1188
01:35:35,593 --> 01:35:37,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on, I'm going to go ahead and cover this next story as well.

1189
01:35:37,975 --> 01:35:39,957
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to do with the iPad.

1190
01:35:40,937 --> 01:35:41,977
[SPEAKER_06]: and PopCap.

1191
01:35:42,777 --> 01:35:49,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently PopCap, or as I've called them before in the show, PopCrack, they do believe that the iPad will change gaming.

1192
01:35:50,359 --> 01:35:53,560
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just going to take about three years and a hardware update before it's really going to happen.

1193
01:35:54,000 --> 01:36:04,862
[SPEAKER_06]: This comes from the co-founder of PopCap, John Vesci, talking to Eurogamer, saying that the iPad will change gaming, it will be phenomenally successful, and it will fulfill a need consumers don't even know they have yet.

1194
01:36:05,542 --> 01:36:08,465
[SPEAKER_06]: The iPad's important, but I think it's going to be more important in three years.

1195
01:36:08,845 --> 01:36:11,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Look how long it took the iPod to get the momentum where everyone has one.

1196
01:36:11,868 --> 01:36:15,311
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably going to take the second generation iPad to make it really like, wow.

1197
01:36:15,871 --> 01:36:18,533
[SPEAKER_06]: This is my opinion, and I think it's going to be phenomenally successful.

1198
01:36:18,573 --> 01:36:19,054
[SPEAKER_06]: I really do.

1199
01:36:19,394 --> 01:36:20,035
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very simple.

1200
01:36:20,075 --> 01:36:22,957
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like it has a magical set of features, just a great package.

1201
01:36:23,378 --> 01:36:27,981
[SPEAKER_06]: I know what I'm getting when I have to get my mom a computer now, an iPad, because she can't screw it up.

1202
01:36:28,102 --> 01:36:29,303
[SPEAKER_06]: She can't download a bunch of stuff.

1203
01:36:29,323 --> 01:36:30,784
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the perfect mom computer, right?

1204
01:36:31,084 --> 01:36:32,905
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's the perfect computer for 10 year olds to play with.

1205
01:36:32,925 --> 01:36:36,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, those comments from PopCap co-founder John Vesci to Hero Gamer.

1206
01:36:48,897 --> 01:36:50,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, what's this attachment?

1207
01:36:50,178 --> 01:36:50,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Virus?

1208
01:36:51,278 --> 01:36:53,119
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds interesting.

1209
01:36:53,259 --> 01:37:00,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, my mom, who for the longest time didn't even know what the CD tray did in a computer, is now using email.

1210
01:37:00,503 --> 01:37:02,364
[SPEAKER_06]: And I get emails from her, and it's very strange.

1211
01:37:02,804 --> 01:37:04,505
[SPEAKER_11]: My grandmother's using email.

1212
01:37:04,585 --> 01:37:06,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm worried the next time I go, she's going to be like...

1213
01:37:06,766 --> 01:37:07,287
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1214
01:37:26,846 --> 01:37:27,086
[SPEAKER_06]: and so on.

1215
01:37:48,435 --> 01:37:53,560
[SPEAKER_07]: The Apple products are not computers for complete idiots that can't understand anything.

1216
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:57,703
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, at least that's, I hope, not the impression that they're trying to put out there.

1217
01:37:58,484 --> 01:38:00,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sorry, you're too dumb for PC.

1218
01:38:00,225 --> 01:38:03,008
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to move to the Apple products.

1219
01:38:03,988 --> 01:38:07,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Apple products, it's special ed for computer users.

1220
01:38:07,111 --> 01:38:11,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, look, despite the choice of words he used, I think he makes a point.

1221
01:38:11,374 --> 01:38:13,857
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of the same thing I said about the iPad a couple weeks ago.

1222
01:38:14,597 --> 01:38:42,420
[SPEAKER_06]: there's going to be a new one Apple puts out new ones every year and this first version of the iPad is kind of yoink yoink but let's not forget the iPhone didn't have the apps on it when it first came out and that's what really took the iPhone to the next level the iPad will get its features it's just going to take a year I tell you if an iPad like had a video camera on the front of it so you could do video conferencing from it like over 3G and stuff oh my god it would sell like crazy and that'll be in the revision it will

1223
01:38:43,723 --> 01:38:44,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait and see.

1224
01:38:44,984 --> 01:38:48,666
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it'll change gaming because it'll have a camera, it'll have motion, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1225
01:38:48,686 --> 01:38:49,406
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, though?

1226
01:38:49,566 --> 01:38:56,510
[SPEAKER_07]: The Nintendo Wii 3 will be super awesome because it's going to have holographic graphics and it's just going to be phenomenal.

1227
01:38:56,771 --> 01:38:58,592
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's just support them with that.

1228
01:38:58,612 --> 01:39:04,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, with a PlayStation 4, it's going to vacuum the floor and do the dishes and cook me breakfast.

1229
01:39:06,806 --> 01:39:07,727
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's stupid.

1230
01:39:07,767 --> 01:39:09,148
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a stupid argument.

1231
01:39:09,488 --> 01:39:11,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, it'll be good in three years.

1232
01:39:12,170 --> 01:39:14,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, good for them.

1233
01:39:14,231 --> 01:39:15,472
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be good after they figure it out.

1234
01:39:15,532 --> 01:39:16,333
[SPEAKER_07]: It sucks.

1235
01:39:17,433 --> 01:39:18,194
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

1236
01:39:18,214 --> 01:39:19,375
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an awesome argument.

1237
01:39:19,735 --> 01:39:26,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it sucks now, but eventually when they figure out that it sucks and make a better platform, then it'll be awesome.

1238
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:27,600
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it won't.

1239
01:39:28,161 --> 01:39:30,422
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll still suck, and then they'll come out with something else.

1240
01:39:30,522 --> 01:39:31,083
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be better.

1241
01:39:31,223 --> 01:39:32,944
[SPEAKER_06]: One step closer to the holodeck.

1242
01:39:33,124 --> 01:39:35,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Gaming always takes us one step closer to the holodeck.

1243
01:39:36,492 --> 01:39:37,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Such a stupid argument.

1244
01:39:37,633 --> 01:39:38,253
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

1245
01:39:38,933 --> 01:39:39,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Stupid PopCap.

1246
01:39:40,934 --> 01:39:43,355
[SPEAKER_07]: You make your addicting little games and be done with it.

1247
01:39:43,556 --> 01:39:45,076
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't need your opinion out there in the marketplace.

1248
01:39:45,096 --> 01:39:47,738
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm telling you, Bejeweled Blitz, seriously, crack.

1249
01:39:48,298 --> 01:39:49,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, crack.

1250
01:39:49,619 --> 01:39:54,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and I give them props for making addictive casual games that sell like crazy.

1251
01:39:55,419 --> 01:39:59,862
[SPEAKER_07]: At the same time, they have no fucking clue what platform works well out there.

1252
01:40:00,402 --> 01:40:01,242
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, come on, man.

1253
01:40:01,363 --> 01:40:04,744
[SPEAKER_07]: It is just a large iPod Touch.

1254
01:40:05,485 --> 01:40:07,126
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all it is.

1255
01:40:07,886 --> 01:40:09,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Let the man have an opinion.

1256
01:40:09,367 --> 01:40:09,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

1257
01:40:09,867 --> 01:40:12,689
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be phenomenal later on when the new version comes out.

1258
01:40:12,709 --> 01:40:18,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's awesome, but by that time, they're going to come out with something else, and people are going to totally forget about the iPad.

1259
01:40:18,372 --> 01:40:20,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Where every gamer has a voice, Loki.

1260
01:40:20,353 --> 01:40:20,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Every gamer.

1261
01:40:22,748 --> 01:40:23,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

1262
01:40:24,329 --> 01:40:26,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Loki, what do you have for us next with news?

1263
01:40:26,889 --> 01:40:29,790
[SPEAKER_07]: God, it's so frustrating.

1264
01:40:31,071 --> 01:40:33,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, apparently they're making movies about anything nowadays.

1265
01:40:33,892 --> 01:40:39,154
[SPEAKER_07]: That's especially the case when it comes to licensing movie or games into movies.

1266
01:40:39,174 --> 01:40:45,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of which, you know, half these games that get licensed into movies, it's like, where the hell are they?

1267
01:40:45,616 --> 01:40:48,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, for example, Clock Tower, where the hell is that?

1268
01:40:49,077 --> 01:40:52,098
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, shit, they're making movies based on Battleship.

1269
01:40:52,486 --> 01:40:55,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't there supposed to be a Silent Hill 2 movie at some point too?

1270
01:40:55,808 --> 01:40:59,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, I'm sure after they're done churning out remakes.

1271
01:40:59,811 --> 01:41:01,292
[SPEAKER_06]: There's supposed to be a new Clue.

1272
01:41:02,213 --> 01:41:04,935
[SPEAKER_06]: They keep saying it's a remake of the 80s one, but it's not.

1273
01:41:05,175 --> 01:41:07,617
[SPEAKER_06]: That is scripture to me.

1274
01:41:07,657 --> 01:41:10,119
[SPEAKER_06]: You do not remake Clue from the 80s, okay?

1275
01:41:11,140 --> 01:41:14,743
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're going to do Battleship and whatever.

1276
01:41:15,103 --> 01:41:16,444
[SPEAKER_06]: No, and Monopoly.

1277
01:41:16,824 --> 01:41:18,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, there's a Monopoly movie.

1278
01:41:18,365 --> 01:41:19,666
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't.

1279
01:41:20,407 --> 01:41:21,868
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to see a Yahtzee movie.

1280
01:41:22,328 --> 01:41:23,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Go fish.

1281
01:41:25,851 --> 01:41:28,734
[SPEAKER_06]: A movie about an old maid.

1282
01:41:28,754 --> 01:41:29,615
[SPEAKER_06]: It's awful.

1283
01:41:29,755 --> 01:41:31,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Her pairs of friends.

1284
01:41:31,798 --> 01:41:40,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of awful, one of the games that they decided to or I guess the developer of said game is looking to license it into a movie.

1285
01:41:40,447 --> 01:41:41,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of the opposite of where...

1286
01:41:42,749 --> 01:41:50,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Darkest of Days is a game based off of these futuristic soldiers that go back in time to save certain people from different wars.

1287
01:41:51,158 --> 01:41:53,220
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically it's time cop again.

1288
01:41:53,980 --> 01:41:57,884
[SPEAKER_07]: You go back in time and you kill people and whatnot.

1289
01:42:00,071 --> 01:42:09,867
[SPEAKER_07]: So now they're looking at... I guess the writers of The Rock are attached to craft the screenplay.

1290
01:42:09,927 --> 01:42:14,434
[SPEAKER_07]: So hey, that could be kind of cool, because they wrote a pretty good screenplay for The Rock, but...

1291
01:42:16,997 --> 01:42:24,320
[SPEAKER_07]: The good thing about this, though, is the premise is interesting enough where most people won't even realize it's a game tie-in.

1292
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:29,001
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, it's a good thing that they don't associate it with the game at all.

1293
01:42:31,362 --> 01:42:32,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Can they make a movie out of this?

1294
01:42:33,002 --> 01:42:33,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think it would be any good?

1295
01:42:33,922 --> 01:42:35,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's vague enough to where it works.

1296
01:42:35,423 --> 01:42:37,183
[SPEAKER_07]: It's people going back in time killing other people.

1297
01:42:37,484 --> 01:42:38,864
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds interesting enough.

1298
01:42:40,686 --> 01:43:08,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, too bad the game didn't have more of an impact Moving on to a game that probably will have more impact We talked a lot about this last week, Sonic the Hedgehog 4 But the news had just recently came out when we did the show So a little more has developed, including a rumor going around That Sonic the Hedgehog 4 may actually be out in retail Once all of the episodes come out on the various networks Sort of like what they did with Grand Theft Auto 4 They had the download content and then they released it to retail

1299
01:43:09,913 --> 01:43:10,994
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1300
01:43:35,131 --> 01:43:36,392
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what do you think of the petition?

1301
01:44:02,955 --> 01:44:03,696
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1302
01:44:20,803 --> 01:44:25,506
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkTetsuya says, Nah, they'll just charge for DLC to reskin them.

1303
01:44:25,527 --> 01:44:28,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Sad, but probably true.

1304
01:44:47,622 --> 01:44:48,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1305
01:44:48,303 --> 01:44:51,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Blades of Steel says, yeah, internet petitions don't work.

1306
01:44:51,805 --> 01:44:59,489
[SPEAKER_06]: And Rei Ayanami, I love this comment, says, Sonic, I'm really happy for you and I'm going to let you finish, but Twilight has one of the dumbest fan bases of all time.

1307
01:45:02,270 --> 01:45:03,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Take from that what you will.

1308
01:45:05,312 --> 01:45:05,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1309
01:45:05,872 --> 01:45:07,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, let's go to the mailbag.

1310
01:45:12,481 --> 01:45:18,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Every week we invite you guys to send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we read a few of your favorites here on the show.

1311
01:45:19,144 --> 01:45:25,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Since DarkSakura is having voice issues tonight, I'm going to go ahead and relieve her of her mailbag duties and I'll read the mailbag for her.

1312
01:45:25,907 --> 01:45:30,088
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, send us your emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com We just have a couple emails this week.

1313
01:45:30,789 --> 01:45:35,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a whole lot to read tonight, but I do want to read these couple quick emails that we have in the mailbag.

1314
01:45:36,631 --> 01:45:39,072
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to start it off with an email from...

1315
01:45:41,386 --> 01:45:45,987
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see a signature, so I'll just say Sam S from the email header.

1316
01:45:46,647 --> 01:45:47,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Sam says,

1317
01:46:06,152 --> 01:46:34,763
[SPEAKER_06]: so far for 2010 even though we missed like two weeks of show just because there wasn't an actual show I'm pretty good about getting them up in 24 hours so I'd like to pat myself on the back here's a much longer email tonight from the name Molten Brown one of my favorite nicknames that we have out there hey guys it's Molten Brown again yes despite the humor over the name last time I wrote in I decided to keep it well good for you you stick by what you believe in Molten Brown

1318
01:46:35,543 --> 01:46:40,564
[SPEAKER_06]: I listened to your podcast from last week when you touched on the issue of developers' rights again and I wanted to weigh in.

1319
01:46:41,005 --> 01:46:49,107
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my first year of law school and other than making me more cynical about the legal system as a whole, I am realizing how many different things affect the outcome of a lawsuit.

1320
01:46:49,487 --> 01:46:54,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Disclaimer, I could be completely wrong and I accept that, but this is my opinion based on what I know.

1321
01:46:55,068 --> 01:46:55,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine by me.

1322
01:46:55,549 --> 01:46:56,669
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm welcoming of all opinions.

1323
01:46:57,426 --> 01:47:03,229
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, I don't think the developers would have a chance against the companies unless they banded together, and even then it would be questionable.

1324
01:47:03,689 --> 01:47:10,352
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the DarkSakura feels that if you don't do anything about a bad situation, you are helping to create the situation, and I agree with her in part.

1325
01:47:10,872 --> 01:47:15,514
[SPEAKER_06]: But I also realize that the game companies are going to have a lot more money to defend themselves than the developers.

1326
01:47:15,954 --> 01:47:24,458
[SPEAKER_06]: And this affects how good of lawyers they can get, what the lawyers can do on their case, whether the lawyer can devote more time to the case or has to juggle multiple clients at the same time.

1327
01:47:24,898 --> 01:47:25,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching.

1328
01:47:40,174 --> 01:47:42,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Going Through Discovery, and all the other steps of process.

1329
01:47:43,057 --> 01:47:49,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Developers may not have the monetary means to defend themselves with the law, so even if they wanted to, it might not be possible.

1330
01:47:49,542 --> 01:47:50,343
[SPEAKER_06]: And that sucks.

1331
01:47:50,924 --> 01:47:57,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry for being a downer, but I wanted to shed some light on some of the other issues developers may face that prevent them from doing anything.

1332
01:47:57,629 --> 01:47:59,511
[SPEAKER_06]: And Molten Brown signs his email.

1333
01:47:59,911 --> 01:48:02,073
[SPEAKER_06]: This email has been brought to you by Sleep Deprivation.

1334
01:48:02,394 --> 01:48:03,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Need a ready excuse for screwing up?

1335
01:48:03,915 --> 01:48:05,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Sleep Deprivation may be the thing for you.

1336
01:48:07,037 --> 01:48:09,959
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, any comments on the other perspective there?

1337
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:11,580
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I agree with it.

1338
01:48:12,121 --> 01:48:25,129
[SPEAKER_02]: I just still think that if it's still, I think that people need to put the effort into, this is why I'm thinking it would be something like along the lines of a class action lawsuit.

1339
01:48:26,649 --> 01:48:35,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I kind of suggested this a couple weeks ago, and I realize this is a polarizing topic, and I don't want to get too political, but I just want to throw that idea out there and see what sticks.

1340
01:48:36,458 --> 01:48:36,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Unions.

1341
01:48:37,399 --> 01:48:43,564
[SPEAKER_06]: What if there was, like, a union for game developers that they kind of banded together and then maybe could afford some of these things?

1342
01:48:43,604 --> 01:48:44,065
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

1343
01:48:44,425 --> 01:48:48,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, granted, then you get all these, like, the dues that goes with it, but at least there would be, like, a union to fight for rights.

1344
01:48:49,429 --> 01:48:52,772
[SPEAKER_06]: But look, I realize it's a polarizing topic, but I just want to throw the idea out there.

1345
01:48:52,832 --> 01:48:53,073
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean...

1346
01:48:53,653 --> 01:48:55,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you tell me what's right or what's wrong with that idea?

1347
01:48:55,434 --> 01:48:56,294
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a good idea.

1348
01:48:56,314 --> 01:49:02,536
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the whole point that it's sad that we're dealing with, you know, that level of corruption, I think, in the system.

1349
01:49:03,536 --> 01:49:05,577
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to continue this debate next week, that's fine.

1350
01:49:05,637 --> 01:49:10,899
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're going to email us on this topic again at mailbag at orangelounge.com, I really want to hear your thoughts on the whole union idea.

1351
01:49:10,939 --> 01:49:13,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Good idea, bad idea, whatever idea.

1352
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:15,281
[SPEAKER_06]: That was really it for emails this week.

1353
01:49:15,341 --> 01:49:19,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at orangelounge.com if you want to send us more emails.

1354
01:49:20,698 --> 01:49:21,739
[SPEAKER_12]: What was that, DarkSakura?

1355
01:49:21,859 --> 01:49:23,760
[SPEAKER_12]: We're having a child meltdown in the other room.

1356
01:49:23,780 --> 01:49:24,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I can hear.

1357
01:49:24,361 --> 01:49:27,123
[SPEAKER_06]: It's alright, we're going to still try to continue with the show.

1358
01:49:28,184 --> 01:49:30,867
[SPEAKER_06]: After the mailbag, we always like to take a minute to say F.U.

1359
01:49:31,307 --> 01:49:32,648
[SPEAKER_06]: to things that are making us angry.

1360
01:49:32,708 --> 01:49:34,550
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little segment we call the F.U.s of the week.

1361
01:49:50,714 --> 01:49:52,317
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, do you have any angst for us tonight?

1362
01:49:52,517 --> 01:49:53,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Being sick.

1363
01:49:54,120 --> 01:49:54,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1364
01:49:56,884 --> 01:49:57,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really, actually.

1365
01:49:58,306 --> 01:49:59,127
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have anything.

1366
01:50:01,591 --> 01:50:01,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

1367
01:50:01,832 --> 01:50:02,693
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just in a good mood?

1368
01:50:02,733 --> 01:50:03,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything's happy?

1369
01:50:03,835 --> 01:50:04,937
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm in a complacent mood.

1370
01:50:05,558 --> 01:50:06,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, good to hear it.

1371
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:09,082
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really have a lot of FUs either.

1372
01:50:09,102 --> 01:50:10,603
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like I should have something.

1373
01:50:11,104 --> 01:50:15,148
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just give another FU to moving and having to get everything in boxes and all that good stuff.

1374
01:50:15,488 --> 01:50:18,551
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not looking forward to moving, but at least it'll be over after this week.

1375
01:50:18,932 --> 01:50:20,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and an FU to my car.

1376
01:50:21,515 --> 01:50:24,918
[SPEAKER_06]: There's always a new surprise when it breaks down in my car, and today it's the air conditioner.

1377
01:50:26,119 --> 01:50:26,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Goodie, goodie.

1378
01:50:40,104 --> 01:50:40,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Fun time.

1379
01:50:40,584 --> 01:50:41,805
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to do it for the FUs of the week.

1380
01:50:43,065 --> 01:50:43,345
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1381
01:50:44,045 --> 01:50:46,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on with some more news stories.

1382
01:50:46,126 --> 01:50:47,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a couple more for you guys.

1383
01:50:47,186 --> 01:50:52,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1384
01:50:52,668 --> 01:50:58,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Do remember, if you're going to use the Skype client to actually call us, call Echo123 first if you've never been on the show before.

1385
01:50:59,450 --> 01:51:02,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if you have been on the show before, you might just want to double check that you're okay.

1386
01:51:02,831 --> 01:51:02,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki?

1387
01:51:03,673 --> 01:51:15,736
[SPEAKER_07]: During the 2009 fiscal earnings report from Activision, CEO Michael Griffith noted that Bizarre Creations would be doing a multiplayer beta for Blur next month.

1388
01:51:16,136 --> 01:51:23,197
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't specify when exactly it's going to be, but at least it'll be on...

1389
01:51:29,136 --> 01:51:29,616
[SPEAKER_07]: The Xbox 360.

1390
01:51:30,036 --> 01:51:31,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's stupid.

1391
01:51:31,557 --> 01:51:34,439
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't say what platforms the games are coming out on.

1392
01:51:35,399 --> 01:51:36,900
[SPEAKER_07]: PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1393
01:51:37,480 --> 01:51:40,982
[SPEAKER_07]: But no word on which platform they're actually going to do the beta for.

1394
01:51:42,443 --> 01:51:43,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm excited for Blur.

1395
01:51:43,523 --> 01:51:46,165
[SPEAKER_06]: It was one of my favorite things we saw at E3 last year.

1396
01:51:46,205 --> 01:51:47,745
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Mario Kart meets Burnout.

1397
01:51:47,925 --> 01:51:49,126
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's why I was calling it before.

1398
01:51:49,326 --> 01:51:49,766
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be neat.

1399
01:51:50,006 --> 01:51:50,227
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

1400
01:51:50,247 --> 01:51:50,987
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm excited for it.

1401
01:51:52,231 --> 01:51:55,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, and the last story I have for you guys tonight has to do with Game Room.

1402
01:51:55,454 --> 01:51:57,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, I'm pretty excited about Game Room.

1403
01:51:57,476 --> 01:51:58,396
[SPEAKER_06]: I love my classic games.

1404
01:51:58,837 --> 01:52:02,260
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are some more tidbits coming out of the X10 event when it comes to Game Room.

1405
01:52:03,100 --> 01:52:06,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, five to seven games a week are supposed to be added for download.

1406
01:52:06,984 --> 01:52:07,924
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what they're claiming.

1407
01:52:07,964 --> 01:52:09,626
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see if it becomes a reality or not.

1408
01:52:10,226 --> 01:52:15,431
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to do like a weekly release on a particular day, kind of like what they do for Rock Band or the Xbox Live Arcade.

1409
01:52:16,091 --> 01:52:19,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, they're looking at Thursday, but that could change.

1410
01:52:20,194 --> 01:52:24,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, apparently they're going to add some incentives for you to get games the day that they come out.

1411
01:52:25,356 --> 01:52:30,859
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you buy a game the day it comes out, it will be a special item that stays with you in your personal game room.

1412
01:52:31,819 --> 01:52:38,062
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things that the game room producer Fred Norton was showing off was a helicopter that flew around the player's avatar.

1413
01:52:38,702 --> 01:52:40,963
[SPEAKER_06]: The day one exclusives would be different for every game.

1414
01:52:41,263 --> 01:52:44,785
[SPEAKER_06]: It would somehow tie into the game's iconography.

1415
01:52:44,865 --> 01:52:45,505
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, you know,

1416
01:52:46,185 --> 01:52:56,692
[SPEAKER_06]: and if you really watch that Game Room trailer you can see like a little yellow dragon from Adventure rendered in 3D which I know sounds weird but it's like walking around the little playhouse.

1417
01:52:57,013 --> 01:53:00,095
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet it would be little things like that that you're going to get for day one releases.

1418
01:53:00,715 --> 01:53:01,275
[SPEAKER_06]: I would imagine.

1419
01:53:02,536 --> 01:53:06,277
[SPEAKER_07]: So have they mentioned how you're going to be able to go to like friends game rooms and stuff like that?

1420
01:53:06,297 --> 01:53:09,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Because what's the point in decorating your own game room if only you see it?

1421
01:53:09,678 --> 01:53:10,538
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they haven't.

1422
01:53:10,578 --> 01:53:14,259
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm thinking I wouldn't get too excited about this.

1423
01:53:14,319 --> 01:53:18,400
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's just going to be that you have your game room and you can go look at others' games room.

1424
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:20,541
[SPEAKER_06]: I would think that you would at least be able to play a demo.

1425
01:53:20,821 --> 01:53:21,521
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know what it is?

1426
01:53:21,621 --> 01:53:23,862
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be the way for them to solicit the quarters.

1427
01:53:24,422 --> 01:53:28,443
[SPEAKER_06]: You probably will do a lot of your 40 Microsoft Point play or your 50 cent play.

1428
01:53:28,863 --> 01:53:38,429
[SPEAKER_06]: visiting other people's game rooms I think that's the whole idea behind it is go visit your friends game rooms and try out their machines for 40 points at pop I bet you that's what it is

1429
01:53:40,020 --> 01:53:41,021
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see though.

1430
01:53:41,241 --> 01:53:48,125
[SPEAKER_06]: There's still a ways to go before the end of March when Game Room is expected to come out and hopefully our questions will be answered by then.

1431
01:53:48,906 --> 01:53:52,688
[SPEAKER_06]: So that does it for the scheduled stories we have tonight.

1432
01:53:53,008 --> 01:53:54,869
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to go ahead and go to the Skype line.

1433
01:53:54,929 --> 01:54:04,275
[SPEAKER_06]: First though, before we get to the Skype line tonight, I want to play this voicemail because this is about something we probably haven't talked enough about on the show, but it is a big thing going on on our website right now.

1434
01:54:04,315 --> 01:54:05,716
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me play this voicemail first.

1435
01:54:08,385 --> 01:54:11,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi Rob, this is Brett Wall from Undersedation Live.

1436
01:54:12,126 --> 01:54:20,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Our show's on hiatus, so I'm leaving a voicemail to Orange Lounge Radio reminding all of your listeners to participate in QSL Madness.

1437
01:54:21,029 --> 01:54:21,909
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm getting distracted.

1438
01:54:22,289 --> 01:54:25,010
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're in the round of 64 right now.

1439
01:54:25,030 --> 01:54:27,071
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some fantastic matchups going on.

1440
01:54:27,231 --> 01:54:30,532
[SPEAKER_09]: All you need is a form account and a hand to click your mouse with.

1441
01:54:31,572 --> 01:54:32,733
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all in our form.

1442
01:54:33,153 --> 01:54:35,734
[SPEAKER_09]: They're at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

1443
01:54:35,754 --> 01:54:36,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Be sure to visit and

1444
01:54:37,259 --> 01:54:39,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello to everybody out there in Orange Bond Radio Land.

1445
01:54:39,921 --> 01:54:41,263
[SPEAKER_09]: We missed you on USL.

1446
01:54:41,343 --> 01:54:42,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, talk to you later.

1447
01:54:43,044 --> 01:54:43,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

1448
01:54:44,666 --> 01:54:46,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much, Bressel, from Under Station Live.

1449
01:54:46,968 --> 01:54:47,969
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know they were on hiatus.

1450
01:54:47,989 --> 01:54:48,629
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on there?

1451
01:54:48,970 --> 01:54:51,111
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought I saw a tweet about it, but I don't know.

1452
01:54:51,151 --> 01:54:54,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes Travis threatens to go on hiatus, but then doesn't really go on hiatus.

1453
01:54:54,054 --> 01:54:55,916
[SPEAKER_06]: So I hope everything's okay over at USL Land.

1454
01:54:56,316 --> 01:54:56,997
[SPEAKER_06]: So whatever.

1455
01:54:57,677 --> 01:54:59,359
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you guys get better or whatever's going on.

1456
01:54:59,999 --> 01:55:08,165
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, Under Station Live Madness, the big battle to figure out the greatest video game of all time is going on right now on the Orange Lounge Radio forums.

1457
01:55:08,625 --> 01:55:10,747
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of some surprising things going on there.

1458
01:55:10,827 --> 01:55:16,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I kind of lost my shit and got angry when Time Crisis beat Civilization, which I think is a travesty.

1459
01:55:16,731 --> 01:55:18,793
[SPEAKER_06]: But whatever, I'll leave my opinions on the forums.

1460
01:55:20,094 --> 01:55:45,693
[SPEAKER_06]: You can vote for whichever game you like more And then they kind of whittle their way down It's kind of modeled after a March Madness NCAA kind of thing To the greatest video game of all time Which Super Metroid won one year I think Mario 3 won it last year And so we'll see who wins this year There's a bunch of stuff going on on the forums right now So if you haven't checked that out, check that out on the forums At OrangeLoungeRadio.com There's a whole little March Madness section there So take a look

1461
01:55:46,624 --> 01:55:51,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we're going to go to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1462
01:55:51,666 --> 01:55:53,287
[SPEAKER_06]: We're now open for business on the Skype line.

1463
01:55:53,347 --> 01:55:55,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead and give us a call if you'd like, and we'll take some calls.

1464
01:55:56,928 --> 01:55:57,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1465
01:55:57,929 --> 01:55:58,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1466
01:55:59,309 --> 01:56:00,690
[SPEAKER_06]: This is DSMaster26.

1467
01:56:00,810 --> 01:56:02,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, DSMaster, what's on your mind?

1468
01:56:04,971 --> 01:56:06,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Not much.

1469
01:56:06,892 --> 01:56:13,575
[SPEAKER_08]: I participated in the finale of 1 vs. 100, which was perceived to be a Halo game.

1470
01:56:16,683 --> 01:56:17,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

1471
01:56:17,483 --> 01:56:18,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Did that happen tonight?

1472
01:56:18,404 --> 01:56:19,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Was the 1 vs. 100 finale tonight?

1473
01:56:21,165 --> 01:56:23,626
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it was two days ago.

1474
01:56:24,486 --> 01:56:25,147
[SPEAKER_06]: So what did they do?

1475
01:56:25,207 --> 01:56:26,847
[SPEAKER_06]: What made it such a Halo fangasm?

1476
01:56:26,907 --> 01:56:27,348
[SPEAKER_06]: I missed it.

1477
01:56:27,388 --> 01:56:29,068
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot that the season was coming to an end.

1478
01:56:30,049 --> 01:56:35,151
[SPEAKER_08]: They had two of the creators from Halo 3 and 3 of it.

1479
01:56:35,531 --> 01:56:38,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, the creators of the whole series on there.

1480
01:56:39,273 --> 01:56:44,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Talking about the Halo series and Halo Legends being on

1481
01:56:53,679 --> 01:56:57,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Was there any mention of the whole news about Xbox Live?

1482
01:56:57,161 --> 01:57:03,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I know this just happened a couple weeks ago about original Xbox Live shutting down for original Xbox and how that will impact Halo 2.

1483
01:57:04,186 --> 01:57:04,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Did that come up at all?

1484
01:57:07,128 --> 01:57:08,649
[SPEAKER_08]: I did not talk about that.

1485
01:57:09,629 --> 01:57:11,611
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that doesn't really surprise me.

1486
01:57:11,651 --> 01:57:13,292
[SPEAKER_06]: I just kind of wondered if that would come up at all.

1487
01:57:13,633 --> 01:57:16,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Did they say anything during the finale about the next season of 1 vs. 100?

1488
01:57:19,297 --> 01:57:26,043
[SPEAKER_08]: They said there is definitely going to be Season 3, but they don't know exactly when it's possibly going to start.

1489
01:57:26,063 --> 01:57:30,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn, it's cold in Nebraska.

1490
01:57:31,127 --> 01:57:31,287
Yeah.

1491
01:57:34,148 --> 01:57:35,549
[SPEAKER_08]: And the sky is blue.

1492
01:57:35,569 --> 01:57:36,009
[SPEAKER_06]: What else is new?

1493
01:57:36,029 --> 01:57:38,011
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a little bit of a news announcement for you guys.

1494
01:57:38,031 --> 01:57:46,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the broadcasting class from the Career Center over here in Omaha, Nebraska is coming all the way to Anaheim, California.

1495
01:57:48,279 --> 01:57:48,599
All right.

1496
01:57:48,940 --> 01:57:49,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, wait.

1497
01:57:49,460 --> 01:57:51,361
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to take it back to 1 vs. 100 for a minute here.

1498
01:57:51,702 --> 01:57:53,003
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you want to see in Season 3?

1499
01:57:54,964 --> 01:57:55,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh?

1500
01:57:56,345 --> 01:57:57,907
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you want to see in Season 3 of 1 vs. 100?

1501
01:57:57,947 --> 01:57:58,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh.

1502
01:58:02,970 --> 01:58:08,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, probably them to try to get... Oh, God.

1503
01:58:08,217 --> 01:58:11,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably the guys behind DJ Hero or something like that.

1504
01:58:12,483 --> 01:58:12,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Like...

1505
01:58:13,382 --> 01:58:17,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and actually, that same night with the Halo guys, Jimmy Fallon popped in once or twice.

1506
01:58:38,717 --> 01:58:39,918
[SPEAKER_08]: He was definitely funny.

1507
01:58:39,938 --> 01:58:40,919
[SPEAKER_08]: He also plays 1 vs. 100.

1508
01:58:40,979 --> 01:58:41,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh.

1509
01:58:41,139 --> 01:58:41,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Well...

1510
01:59:02,574 --> 01:59:12,119
[SPEAKER_08]: There are three game shows in my mind that would be really good for Xbox 5 and that same spiel that 1 vs. 100 is going at.

1511
01:59:13,059 --> 01:59:14,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, but not really.

1512
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:16,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Deal or no deal, no.

1513
01:59:16,941 --> 01:59:17,662
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a no-go.

1514
01:59:18,882 --> 01:59:21,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably Who Wants to be a Millionaire, that'd be good.

1515
01:59:21,283 --> 01:59:23,885
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a video game years ago.

1516
01:59:24,025 --> 01:59:24,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Good idea.

1517
01:59:26,885 --> 01:59:34,547
[SPEAKER_06]: I do also give a big fat no to Deal or No Deal because I hate that game show.

1518
01:59:34,667 --> 01:59:35,927
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a terrible game show.

1519
01:59:36,187 --> 01:59:42,149
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the worst game show, one of the worst they've ever done because Deal or No Deal takes absolutely no skill.

1520
01:59:42,269 --> 01:59:43,929
[SPEAKER_06]: There is zero skill involved.

1521
01:59:44,129 --> 01:59:48,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of Deal or No Deal, you know those ticket redemption games, right?

1522
01:59:48,530 --> 01:59:49,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I've played it.

1523
01:59:49,470 --> 01:59:51,171
[SPEAKER_08]: They need a deal or no deal for that now.

1524
01:59:51,611 --> 01:59:52,472
[SPEAKER_06]: I've played it.

1525
01:59:52,612 --> 01:59:53,732
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate to admit, I've played it.

1526
01:59:54,452 --> 02:00:02,115
[SPEAKER_06]: My friend, it wasn't me, but one of my friends actually got all the way down to opening the final case and won the jackpot.

1527
02:00:02,195 --> 02:00:02,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I was amazed.

1528
02:00:04,296 --> 02:00:08,457
[SPEAKER_06]: But then I also wasn't because I was like, she just got lucky because there's no skill involved.

1529
02:00:09,918 --> 02:00:11,399
[SPEAKER_08]: There are two game shows in my mind.

1530
02:00:12,119 --> 02:00:14,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Would possibly have to be like Wheel of Fortune.

1531
02:00:14,740 --> 02:00:15,640
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be pretty good.

1532
02:00:16,841 --> 02:00:17,021
[SPEAKER_08]: And...

1533
02:00:18,547 --> 02:00:19,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Hollywood Squares.

1534
02:00:20,728 --> 02:00:22,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Hollywood Squares I'd be down with.

1535
02:00:22,289 --> 02:00:23,109
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be pretty funny.

1536
02:00:23,129 --> 02:00:24,550
[SPEAKER_06]: You could totally do the prices right.

1537
02:00:24,990 --> 02:00:25,650
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you could.

1538
02:00:25,890 --> 02:00:26,830
[SPEAKER_06]: You could, but they won't.

1539
02:00:27,151 --> 02:00:29,752
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, DS Master.

1540
02:00:30,012 --> 02:00:40,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to let you know, I don't know what ear to my phone or something, but the audio when you're speaking on my end, like you're sounding a little bit crackly.

1541
02:00:40,516 --> 02:00:42,557
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what's up.

1542
02:00:43,077 --> 02:00:44,678
[SPEAKER_06]: It's demons in the phone system.

1543
02:00:47,489 --> 02:00:47,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn.

1544
02:00:48,251 --> 02:00:49,553
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, have a good night, DS Master.

1545
02:00:50,495 --> 02:00:53,581
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, you too, and happy Valentine's Day, all our crew.

1546
02:00:53,962 --> 02:00:54,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Later.

1547
02:00:55,729 --> 02:01:17,701
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what that is it's always going to sound a little weird over our little rigged setup here but do remember if you do call OLR turn your volume down a lot so that you don't get picked up in fact it's even best to turn it off or mute it or something just keep that in mind 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype Orange Lounge Radio on Skype Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?

1548
02:01:19,182 --> 02:01:22,104
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi this is Spazinator Hi Spazinator what's on your mind?

1549
02:01:24,608 --> 02:01:29,772
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, well, one issue is kind of a compound issue.

1550
02:01:30,832 --> 02:01:38,137
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you saw my one tweet from earlier, but I kind of want to take Sony to ask about a problem that I'm having.

1551
02:01:38,637 --> 02:01:39,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Please do.

1552
02:01:40,618 --> 02:01:51,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, my initial problem is my PlayStation 3 just last weekend got the dreaded yellow light of death.

1553
02:01:52,981 --> 02:01:53,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-oh.

1554
02:01:55,363 --> 02:02:08,272
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm sure you, DarkSakura, and Loki all know what that is.

1555
02:02:08,393 --> 02:02:11,455
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't bother explaining it.

1556
02:02:11,735 --> 02:02:17,279
[SPEAKER_06]: So are you just mad about the yellow light, or did something happen in trying to get it fixed?

1557
02:02:19,901 --> 02:02:21,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Using so much the

1558
02:02:23,191 --> 02:02:24,491
[SPEAKER_10]: the Joe White Adults.

1559
02:02:25,311 --> 02:02:32,773
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that systems fail and I can always, you know, and I plan on taking it to Sony to every fix.

1560
02:02:33,253 --> 02:02:34,753
[SPEAKER_10]: There isn't so much a problem.

1561
02:02:35,513 --> 02:02:52,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Where the problem lies is that when I explained the situation to one of the Sony reps and told them that I didn't need to send my system in for repairs, I need to explain to them that I have two profiles on my system and one of which is for gaming and one is

1562
02:02:53,464 --> 02:02:55,485
[SPEAKER_10]: for purchasing movies and TV shows.

1563
02:02:56,946 --> 02:03:01,689
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have a lot of video content that I purchased through the store.

1564
02:03:02,949 --> 02:03:16,657
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was concerned about being able to play the videos that I purchased once I get the system back because they get really wonky DRM.

1565
02:03:17,798 --> 02:03:21,240
[SPEAKER_10]: And to paraphrase what the one rep said,

1566
02:03:22,329 --> 02:03:26,982
[SPEAKER_10]: There's like a 50-50 chance that you may lose all your content.

1567
02:03:29,246 --> 02:03:30,847
[SPEAKER_06]: A 50-50 chance?

1568
02:03:31,267 --> 02:03:34,009
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell kind of advice is that?

1569
02:03:34,069 --> 02:03:34,790
[SPEAKER_06]: That's weird.

1570
02:03:35,690 --> 02:03:37,812
[SPEAKER_06]: I interpret that as there's a zero chance.

1571
02:03:37,852 --> 02:03:40,073
[SPEAKER_06]: They're giving you false hope and that's pretty disgusting.

1572
02:03:40,674 --> 02:03:44,476
[SPEAKER_06]: And I remember you went through this whole mess not that long ago.

1573
02:03:45,337 --> 02:03:49,780
[SPEAKER_06]: You lost all your DRM to video content and you finally got it.

1574
02:03:49,800 --> 02:03:52,401
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember you called us and we said, don't take no for an answer.

1575
02:03:52,441 --> 02:03:53,102
[SPEAKER_06]: You keep calling back.

1576
02:03:53,382 --> 02:03:55,664
[SPEAKER_06]: And finally you were able to get some of it back.

1577
02:03:55,744 --> 02:03:57,545
[SPEAKER_06]: But it sounds like they're running you through that gauntlet again.

1578
02:03:59,006 --> 02:04:00,406
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1579
02:04:01,567 --> 02:04:24,355
[SPEAKER_10]: My line of thought is to follow with what you just said, is that I paid through the nose for all this content, you know, two to three bucks per TV episode, you know, I got a whole shit ton of them, plus $10 to $15 per movie.

1580
02:04:27,206 --> 02:04:32,170
[SPEAKER_10]: And I get like hundreds and hundreds of videos, so needless to say, that's a lot of money.

1581
02:04:33,170 --> 02:04:38,835
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, I expect that since I pay for all this stuff, I should be able to use it.

1582
02:04:39,716 --> 02:04:48,663
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, right now I have a hardware failure, you know, which I have to send my machine into a repair bus.

1583
02:04:49,481 --> 02:04:55,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Once I get the machine repair, I should be able to play the content that I purchased.

1584
02:04:56,484 --> 02:05:14,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Spazator, please keep us posted with what happens after the repair and everything, or which side of the 50-50 or whatever you end up on, because if you do lose your access to all that and they don't do anything about it, I want to help put it out there in the public, because everybody needs to think twice about buying something.

1585
02:05:14,671 --> 02:05:20,915
[SPEAKER_06]: A damn thing from Sony if, you know, this is the way they're going to treat it as like, well, there's a 50-50 chance it might still work.

1586
02:05:21,336 --> 02:05:22,957
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why people hate DRM.

1587
02:05:23,457 --> 02:05:27,400
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they're going to leave the door wide open like this, people need to know to not support it.

1588
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:37,087
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would really encourage you that if Sony does not do the right thing, does not satisfy you, does not leave you a satisfied customer, stop buying stuff on the marketplace.

1589
02:05:37,167 --> 02:05:38,107
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that's going to be painful.

1590
02:05:38,187 --> 02:05:39,028
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you use them a lot.

1591
02:05:39,268 --> 02:05:40,569
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're going to have to explore alternatives.

1592
02:05:40,589 --> 02:05:41,069
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to.

1593
02:05:41,249 --> 02:05:41,930
[SPEAKER_06]: You owe it to yourself.

1594
02:05:43,564 --> 02:05:58,515
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, what I got planned for your time being, which I already mentioned, on Twitter and Facebook is I never set my system in just yet because I'm waiting on a check from a Social Security Disability P.E.

1595
02:05:58,675 --> 02:06:01,557
[SPEAKER_10]: to cover the cost of the repairs.

1596
02:06:02,238 --> 02:06:03,859
[SPEAKER_10]: But once I do get that check...

1597
02:06:05,837 --> 02:06:06,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Good idea.

1598
02:06:06,258 --> 02:06:13,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Spaznier, we're going to have to wrap up so we can get to some more calls, but please keep us posted on what happens.

1599
02:06:23,365 --> 02:06:23,745
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure.

1600
02:06:23,865 --> 02:06:24,226
[SPEAKER_10]: Will do.

1601
02:06:24,426 --> 02:06:24,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1602
02:06:25,526 --> 02:06:26,187
[SPEAKER_06]: You too, Spadina.

1603
02:06:26,227 --> 02:06:26,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, buddy.

1604
02:06:27,047 --> 02:06:27,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck.

1605
02:06:27,307 --> 02:06:27,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Let us know what happens.

1606
02:06:29,208 --> 02:06:30,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, that is irritating.

1607
02:06:31,109 --> 02:06:32,870
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be so mad if I was him right now.

1608
02:06:33,711 --> 02:06:35,371
[SPEAKER_06]: And I love what Brad is saying here in chat.

1609
02:06:35,391 --> 02:06:37,753
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, we don't know what the end result's gonna be, so we'll see.

1610
02:06:38,053 --> 02:06:42,755
[SPEAKER_06]: But Brad says in chat, shit like this is why I just torrent my video content.

1611
02:06:42,835 --> 02:06:45,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, Loki was just having this whole spiel on piracy earlier.

1612
02:06:45,957 --> 02:06:47,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, this is it right here.

1613
02:06:47,398 --> 02:06:49,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, people pirate because of DRM.

1614
02:06:49,179 --> 02:06:50,960
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you want to know legitimately...

1615
02:06:51,560 --> 02:06:57,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Why there might be a fraction of a reason to support piracy, listen to Spassinator's call.

1616
02:06:57,985 --> 02:07:07,611
[SPEAKER_06]: If his thing comes back and none of his content works again, I'm going to be like, dude, you should be pirating things on the PlayStation marketplace because that's the only way you're going to get around the DRM.

1617
02:07:07,631 --> 02:07:09,753
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see why it wouldn't work because...

1618
02:07:10,854 --> 02:07:13,175
[SPEAKER_07]: It's tied to his account, not his system.

1619
02:07:13,496 --> 02:07:14,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he had the problem before.

1620
02:07:14,737 --> 02:07:18,199
[SPEAKER_06]: But, dude, can you believe a rep told him there's a 50-50 chance you're going to lose it all?

1621
02:07:18,219 --> 02:07:20,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's stupid people working for all companies.

1622
02:07:20,661 --> 02:07:22,383
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like saying, I might like you and I might not.

1623
02:07:22,703 --> 02:07:23,003
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1624
02:07:23,063 --> 02:07:26,006
[SPEAKER_06]: As a customer service trainer, that irritates me.

1625
02:07:26,606 --> 02:07:27,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Call back and talk to a different rep.

1626
02:07:29,048 --> 02:07:29,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get to another call.

1627
02:07:29,929 --> 02:07:30,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1628
02:07:30,990 --> 02:07:31,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1629
02:07:32,151 --> 02:07:32,571
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.

1630
02:07:32,651 --> 02:07:34,292
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from the west coast of Sweden.

1631
02:07:34,332 --> 02:07:35,213
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Judith speaking.

1632
02:07:35,393 --> 02:07:36,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, hello.

1633
02:07:36,394 --> 02:07:37,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Another Swedish listener?

1634
02:07:37,835 --> 02:07:38,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know Ake Ripper?

1635
02:07:39,471 --> 02:07:43,712
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't know him, but I heard him on the last episode, I think he called in.

1636
02:07:44,272 --> 02:07:45,873
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've heard him a bunch of times.

1637
02:07:46,173 --> 02:07:49,213
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured I'd try and get on and represent Sweden.

1638
02:07:50,194 --> 02:07:52,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, we're all about... Dude, we're like getting bigger than ABBA.

1639
02:07:52,834 --> 02:07:53,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, no, alright.

1640
02:07:55,215 --> 02:07:56,755
[SPEAKER_06]: So to what do we owe this phone call tonight?

1641
02:07:56,775 --> 02:07:57,275
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind?

1642
02:07:57,975 --> 02:07:58,736
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a couple of things.

1643
02:07:58,876 --> 02:07:59,616
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I would like to...

1644
02:08:00,596 --> 02:08:06,623
[SPEAKER_00]: Do like a shout out to the person who directed me to Orange Lounge Radio and got me to start listening to it.

1645
02:08:07,183 --> 02:08:08,264
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's Dalit.

1646
02:08:08,525 --> 02:08:11,207
[SPEAKER_00]: It's D-A-L-33-T.

1647
02:08:12,709 --> 02:08:18,435
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think he's ever called in or been on the chat, but I just want to give him a big thank you and hopefully he hears this and gets back to me.

1648
02:08:18,715 --> 02:08:26,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Dalit, thank you for being Leet because we always do say at the end of the show if you like Orange Lounge Radio tell a friend or two about the show and help us spread the word.

1649
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:30,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Clearly Leet has done that and gets a gold star for his efforts.

1650
02:08:30,602 --> 02:08:30,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1651
02:08:31,663 --> 02:08:33,224
[SPEAKER_02]: And happy first call to the show.

1652
02:08:33,604 --> 02:08:34,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and happy first call to the show.

1653
02:08:35,615 --> 02:08:36,815
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I'll have many more.

1654
02:08:37,776 --> 02:08:38,696
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also have a question.

1655
02:08:39,416 --> 02:08:47,058
[SPEAKER_00]: You had talked a bit about piracy before, and it's such a big concern, and there's been a lot of talking about it in the chat.

1656
02:08:47,998 --> 02:08:49,078
[SPEAKER_00]: What should they do to prevent it?

1657
02:08:49,119 --> 02:08:59,101
[SPEAKER_00]: Should they have more DRM, less DRM, more extreme DRM, like maybe having to take a photo of your receipt and then send it in and have to call in and then have it activated online?

1658
02:08:59,201 --> 02:09:02,122
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what should companies do to prevent piracy?

1659
02:09:03,623 --> 02:09:04,764
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think there's an easy answer.

1660
02:09:04,804 --> 02:09:08,165
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if that answer were out there, it would probably be being done right now.

1661
02:09:08,225 --> 02:09:09,226
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.

1662
02:09:09,446 --> 02:09:12,707
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not easy to solve, but how should they go about trying to solve it?

1663
02:09:12,807 --> 02:09:13,348
[SPEAKER_00]: What approach?

1664
02:09:14,248 --> 02:09:16,229
[SPEAKER_00]: More restrictions or more freedom?

1665
02:09:17,893 --> 02:09:21,316
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a fan of the program-based DRM.

1666
02:09:21,536 --> 02:09:25,980
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer activation codes, though they are easier to bypass.

1667
02:09:27,100 --> 02:09:38,750
[SPEAKER_02]: But for an example of it being effective, when I was given Guild Wars as a present and my activation code had been scratched off, I couldn't find a generator, I couldn't do anything.

1668
02:09:39,290 --> 02:09:45,237
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually took a photo of my code and gave them the serial number off of my box.

1669
02:09:45,357 --> 02:09:56,410
[SPEAKER_02]: They sent me a new code and that to me I think is less frustrating than having to deal with something that's going to install on your system or having to re-download things.

1670
02:09:56,990 --> 02:09:57,470
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're

1671
02:10:23,695 --> 02:10:25,497
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where things are going to go.

1672
02:10:25,717 --> 02:10:27,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I think they should go there?

1673
02:10:28,079 --> 02:10:30,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe not, but that's where they're going to go.

1674
02:10:32,302 --> 02:10:37,627
[SPEAKER_06]: I always miss the old, you have to look in the manual to look at the faces or match things up.

1675
02:10:38,368 --> 02:10:41,150
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how they used to do the old PC stuff back in the day.

1676
02:10:41,190 --> 02:10:43,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but that stuff, you can photocopy that.

1677
02:10:43,552 --> 02:10:44,613
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, but I miss that stuff.

1678
02:10:44,833 --> 02:10:57,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, here's my real answer, though, is that I think one way that they could do it is, it's kind of one thing they're doing, is it's kind of one of those fight fire with fire, is that the publishers themselves go out on these torrent sites and put the games up for download, but they're borked versions.

1679
02:10:58,303 --> 02:11:01,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the whole, you remember, Arkham Asylum was crippled.

1680
02:11:01,526 --> 02:11:02,887
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mirror's Edge and stuff like that, yeah.

1681
02:11:02,927 --> 02:11:03,147
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I...

1682
02:11:03,447 --> 02:11:03,987
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com

1683
02:11:30,527 --> 02:11:42,735
[SPEAKER_07]: So that may work in the short run, but people will find, or, you know, as in the case of Batman Arkham Asylum, people will find a way around it within like a day, and that will be done for.

1684
02:11:43,276 --> 02:11:59,606
[SPEAKER_07]: So really the easiest way to do it, and unfortunately it is going to be the mandatory online activations, and it's basically going to be a code inside like a manual or something like that that they're going to have to enter into some online service to download a key or something.

1685
02:12:00,987 --> 02:12:06,550
[SPEAKER_07]: or it's going to be inside the manual and you put it in the game and then people will find a key generator around it.

1686
02:12:06,630 --> 02:12:09,731
[SPEAKER_07]: So no matter what they do, people will find a way around it.

1687
02:12:10,151 --> 02:12:12,732
[SPEAKER_06]: I got one more thought and then I'm sure you want to say something on this too.

1688
02:12:12,873 --> 02:12:22,817
[SPEAKER_06]: My other thought would be I think the best way to probably stop piracy or at least curb it, I don't think you will ever stop it, but to curb it, I think you make it cheap, you make it stupid.

1689
02:12:23,397 --> 02:12:26,699
[SPEAKER_06]: I would point at iTunes as an example of that.

1690
02:12:26,860 --> 02:12:29,401
[SPEAKER_06]: iTunes kind of showed up in the wake of Napster.

1691
02:12:29,441 --> 02:12:30,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Napster got shut down, obviously.

1692
02:12:31,363 --> 02:12:34,745
[SPEAKER_06]: iTunes kind of showed up as a legitimate way of doing something like Napster.

1693
02:12:35,005 --> 02:12:40,029
[SPEAKER_06]: And the cool thing about iTunes, and I think one reason why it's been very successful, it's easy enough for my mother to use.

1694
02:12:40,389 --> 02:12:42,911
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cheap, 99 cents a song, and stupid.

1695
02:12:43,191 --> 02:12:44,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Click button, purchase song.

1696
02:12:45,072 --> 02:12:48,376
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's why digital distribution and things like Steam are starting to get more and more.

1697
02:12:48,396 --> 02:12:58,406
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think Steam is going to pick up, pardon the pun, Steam, and you're going to see more, you know, these blowout sales, $9.99 for a game, click button, receive game.

1698
02:12:59,449 --> 02:13:06,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, it gives you the illusion of having not really spent anything because you're not dealing with a tangible item.

1699
02:13:06,674 --> 02:13:10,597
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not cashing out money using your card.

1700
02:13:11,117 --> 02:13:13,579
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just clicking a button and there you go.

1701
02:13:13,619 --> 02:13:17,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Your information is already there, which it does encourage people to spend more.

1702
02:13:17,802 --> 02:13:20,104
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm guilty of the same, like Amazon's one click.

1703
02:13:20,984 --> 02:13:21,645
[SPEAKER_02]: That gets me.

1704
02:13:22,205 --> 02:13:24,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I buy books on Kindle and end up paying too much.

1705
02:13:24,866 --> 02:13:26,327
[SPEAKER_06]: And look at the 360.

1706
02:13:27,207 --> 02:13:29,888
[SPEAKER_06]: As Bobby lovingly refers to it, the Microsoft Space Bucks.

1707
02:13:30,008 --> 02:13:32,369
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all just an elaborate illusion that you're spending real money.

1708
02:13:32,830 --> 02:13:35,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, Caller, I know you probably have something you want to say on this.

1709
02:13:36,071 --> 02:13:37,912
[SPEAKER_06]: What are your thoughts on your own question?

1710
02:13:39,079 --> 02:13:43,941
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they need to take away the DRM and make it, like you said, make it cheaper and encourage people to buy it.

1711
02:13:44,421 --> 02:13:56,444
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a painful experience with Bioshock when I first bought it because you can install it like five times and you have to do an online activation and after five times you have to call in and if you want to

1712
02:13:57,369 --> 02:13:57,509
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude,

1713
02:14:12,409 --> 02:14:13,049
[SPEAKER_00]: Bingo.

1714
02:14:13,189 --> 02:14:13,710
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm with you.

1715
02:14:13,810 --> 02:14:17,872
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's almost like our last caller, the guy who's having problems with his video content.

1716
02:14:17,912 --> 02:14:22,835
[SPEAKER_06]: He's being punished for his hardware breaking and him trying to support things and do things the legal way.

1717
02:14:23,115 --> 02:14:31,420
[SPEAKER_06]: You expect anybody to support your – and that's why I said, dude, Spazinator, if it stops working, you need to just stop supporting Sony like that.

1718
02:14:31,620 --> 02:14:34,442
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean he champions for Sony a lot on this show.

1719
02:14:34,722 --> 02:14:36,263
[SPEAKER_06]: But if they're not going to return the favor to him –

1720
02:14:36,823 --> 02:14:54,175
[SPEAKER_06]: they can go F themselves and we should bring it to light that if you use the Sony Video Marketplace to buy content it could possibly be a ticking time bomb hopefully it comes out next week that this was all just a big scare from a bonehead rep at Sony let's hope

1721
02:14:55,777 --> 02:14:56,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow.

1722
02:14:56,998 --> 02:14:58,819
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm not going to take up more of your time.

1723
02:14:59,199 --> 02:15:03,422
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to wish you a happy belated Valentine's Day and say goodbye.

1724
02:15:03,562 --> 02:15:04,963
[SPEAKER_06]: You're still in time here in the U.S.

1725
02:15:05,023 --> 02:15:06,724
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 8.30 and it's still Valentine's Day here.

1726
02:15:06,784 --> 02:15:07,864
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you very much for the call.

1727
02:15:07,904 --> 02:15:08,725
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost 6 a.m.

1728
02:15:08,765 --> 02:15:08,925
[SPEAKER_00]: here.

1729
02:15:10,046 --> 02:15:11,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for staying up late.

1730
02:15:11,567 --> 02:15:12,067
[SPEAKER_06]: It means a lot.

1731
02:15:12,087 --> 02:15:12,467
[SPEAKER_06]: No worries.

1732
02:15:12,867 --> 02:15:13,148
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1733
02:15:13,428 --> 02:15:13,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one, buddy.

1734
02:15:14,769 --> 02:15:14,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Same.

1735
02:15:15,189 --> 02:15:15,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Night.

1736
02:15:16,243 --> 02:15:35,673
[SPEAKER_06]: I love first time callers and you know what I think that's the perfect way to end the Skype line tonight so I'm sorry to those guys that didn't get through tonight remember you still can send us tweets you can send us emails there are tons of other ways to interact with the show but I think let's let's end it on a first time caller tonight that was that was a good note to end on and a good topic very good topic kind of it's it's interesting how those two calls related tonight isn't it

1737
02:15:36,525 --> 02:15:37,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, last minute stories.

1738
02:15:37,866 --> 02:15:39,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, I know you've got to have some last minute stories over there.

1739
02:15:40,548 --> 02:15:40,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

1740
02:15:41,548 --> 02:15:41,788
[SPEAKER_06]: No?

1741
02:15:42,489 --> 02:15:44,930
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I just wasn't paying attention.

1742
02:15:45,691 --> 02:15:47,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Jerk.

1743
02:15:48,513 --> 02:15:52,275
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure we've got something, but I just have to look it up.

1744
02:15:53,956 --> 02:15:56,217
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, do you have any last minute stories for the night?

1745
02:15:56,498 --> 02:15:56,898
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1746
02:15:57,198 --> 02:15:58,539
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm almost done with this hat.

1747
02:16:00,020 --> 02:16:01,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a quick programming note.

1748
02:16:01,161 --> 02:16:08,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Next week, we are still planning on having a show next week, but I just want to warn folks, if things get delayed or something weird happens, it could happen.

1749
02:16:09,167 --> 02:16:11,389
[SPEAKER_06]: This is live, really, not so much podcast.

1750
02:16:12,129 --> 02:16:13,651
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm moving next week.

1751
02:16:13,771 --> 02:16:19,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I have movers that are supposed to be able to do it all in the morning, but just if weird stuff happens, yeah.

1752
02:16:19,795 --> 02:16:25,340
[SPEAKER_06]: The podcast could also be delayed a little bit next week because I may not have internet at my new place right away.

1753
02:16:25,900 --> 02:16:30,303
[SPEAKER_06]: but if worse comes to worse I'll just come over here to Casa de Jamie and take care of things over here.

1754
02:16:30,343 --> 02:16:31,364
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure she won't mind.

1755
02:16:31,844 --> 02:16:34,046
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll make hats together and upload podcasts.

1756
02:16:34,086 --> 02:16:34,546
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be fun.

1757
02:16:34,707 --> 02:16:35,627
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll teach you how to crochet.

1758
02:16:36,268 --> 02:16:36,828
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be fun.

1759
02:16:37,769 --> 02:16:42,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably be more productive than a lot of the things I stay at home and do like World of Warcraft and stuff.

1760
02:16:42,572 --> 02:16:44,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright Loki, got any last minute stories for us?

1761
02:16:44,734 --> 02:16:46,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we'll just cover a few things here.

1762
02:16:47,175 --> 02:16:50,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Sam & Max, The Devil's Playground has been revealed by the OFLC.

1763
02:16:51,939 --> 02:16:54,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, that leaked out when it got raided.

1764
02:16:55,221 --> 02:17:01,065
[SPEAKER_07]: And the episode 1 of that series will now be entitled The Penal Zone.

1765
02:17:01,705 --> 02:17:06,609
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's scheduled to be coming out later on, probably this year.

1766
02:17:07,890 --> 02:17:07,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh...

1767
02:17:09,634 --> 02:17:11,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here.

1768
02:17:12,456 --> 02:17:22,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Holy Invasion of Privacy Batman is unfortunately going to have to change its name after a conflict with an existing IP.

1769
02:17:22,483 --> 02:17:24,384
[SPEAKER_07]: In other words, Batman.

1770
02:17:25,905 --> 02:17:32,149
[SPEAKER_07]: So now it has been changed to What Did I Do to Deserve This, My Lord?

1771
02:17:32,750 --> 02:17:35,311
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, the sequel will be coming out very soon.

1772
02:17:35,552 --> 02:17:37,293
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll include the original as well.

1773
02:17:39,415 --> 02:17:55,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Square Enix has trademarked Deuce X Human Revolution possibly meaning that they're going to be doing a new game in that series and it's been a while it's weird to hear that Square Enix is doing that but I have to remember they absorbed Eidos so this is a little weird for me but okay

1774
02:17:57,389 --> 02:18:11,221
[SPEAKER_07]: and then of course those of you who bought Darksiders early enough received a card with a code on it and the instructions of do not discard this card and you'll want to save this code.

1775
02:18:11,561 --> 02:18:24,551
[SPEAKER_07]: It has been revealed though that that code will entitle you to a free copy of Red Faction Guerrilla for PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 and the offer will be available until the end of March 7th

1776
02:18:25,752 --> 02:18:31,698
[SPEAKER_07]: and apparently no word on exactly when you'll receive those copies.

1777
02:18:32,499 --> 02:18:45,971
[SPEAKER_07]: You will have to pay $5 for shipping, however, but still though, Red Faction Guerrilla is a pretty awesome game and no word if they're still printing those cards and if they're included in copies of the game as of right now.

1778
02:18:48,374 --> 02:18:49,455
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's about it.

1779
02:18:51,306 --> 02:18:51,787
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1780
02:18:52,267 --> 02:18:56,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's going to kind of start to wrap up another edition here.

1781
02:18:56,190 --> 02:18:57,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I saw something else that's kind of funny.

1782
02:18:57,452 --> 02:18:57,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Or not.

1783
02:18:57,832 --> 02:18:58,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Real quick.

1784
02:18:58,913 --> 02:19:00,134
[SPEAKER_07]: No, please, go ahead.

1785
02:19:00,154 --> 02:19:04,838
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't see a link to it or anything, but apparently someone's developed an emulator for the NES.

1786
02:19:05,239 --> 02:19:12,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now it doesn't have any audio in it yet, but they programmed it all in the Blu-ray Java app.

1787
02:19:15,128 --> 02:19:22,118
[SPEAKER_07]: So it will actually be able to run on PlayStation 3s without modification using just a flash drive.

1788
02:19:25,701 --> 02:19:26,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this out yet?

1789
02:19:27,142 --> 02:19:28,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently it is.

1790
02:19:28,082 --> 02:19:29,663
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't see a link to where it was at though.

1791
02:19:30,643 --> 02:19:35,525
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't run, like I said, with sound yet, but it does run most of the ROMs.

1792
02:19:35,665 --> 02:19:38,066
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only a matter of time then before they get the sound and everything.

1793
02:19:38,146 --> 02:19:41,528
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's pretty awesome that they're able to program that and no modification.

1794
02:19:42,208 --> 02:19:45,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully it plays smoothly because the PlayStation controller is a sweet controller.

1795
02:19:45,570 --> 02:19:47,110
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love to play NES games with that.

1796
02:19:48,211 --> 02:19:50,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Ones that I own the cartridge for, legitimately, of course.

1797
02:19:50,432 --> 02:19:50,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

1798
02:19:51,632 --> 02:19:51,973
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

1799
02:19:52,713 --> 02:19:53,013
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1800
02:19:53,854 --> 02:19:57,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's going to do it for another edition here of Orange Lounge Radio.

1801
02:19:57,115 --> 02:20:00,577
[SPEAKER_06]: But before we wrap things up, we've got to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

1802
02:20:00,637 --> 02:20:02,878
[SPEAKER_06]: So, DarkSakura, do you have any final thoughts for us tonight?

1803
02:20:03,599 --> 02:20:04,139
[SPEAKER_05]: I have one.

1804
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:05,420
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

1805
02:20:12,984 --> 02:20:13,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Sigh.

1806
02:20:13,964 --> 02:20:14,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, your final thought.

1807
02:20:17,395 --> 02:20:34,973
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to play more Borderlands my final thought is I'm getting hungry again I had a very lovely breakfast made for me this morning that was very filling but now you know that was a while ago so now I'm getting to the point where I'm like ooh tacos we'll see

1808
02:20:35,538 --> 02:20:39,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, thank you guys so much for downloading our show or listening to us live and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

1809
02:20:40,442 --> 02:20:41,663
[SPEAKER_06]: We really appreciate the support.

1810
02:20:42,684 --> 02:20:52,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, if you do enjoy the show, all we ask, because we don't have advertisements or anything like that, just tell a friend or two about our show and help spread the word of Orange Lounge Radio, just like we heard about happening tonight.

1811
02:20:52,872 --> 02:20:55,154
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you guys very much for continuing to spread the love.

1812
02:20:55,194 --> 02:20:55,635
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all we ask.

1813
02:20:56,535 --> 02:20:57,056
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to do it.

1814
02:20:57,076 --> 02:20:59,778
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be back here next week with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1815
