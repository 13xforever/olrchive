00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,520
The X-10 event brings us a barrage of Xbox news.

2
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,080
You'll see less Guitar Hero in 2010 and what new video game is getting a movie screenplay

3
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:31,200
written for it.

4
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,560
Hello everybody out there and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,920
It's the show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,480
My name is Rob Roberts.

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,960
We'll be talking to you over the next few hours here live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

8
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:53,200
Joining me as she does every week, say hello to the one and only, Dark Sakura.

9
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,800
I hate that noise more than anything.

10
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,800
You know that, right?

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,800
I love that noise.

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
You do that just to make me mad.

13
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,360
Also, just so you know, Jamie's a little sick tonight.

14
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,360
So- In the head.

15
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,000
Well, that's a given.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That's always.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
That's like your thing.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I've had the crap.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Right.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,200
But you're not like coughing and sounding plague-y, you're just, your voice is a little

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,200
eh.

22
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,280
Yeah, it's basically been the kind of cold that kicks your ass and saps your energy.

23
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,000
So you might be hearing a little less of Jamie tonight, so thank God, no I'm kidding.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Bite my ass.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hearts.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,160
But I am busy.

27
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,600
Yeah, she's knitting over there and having fun.

28
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,600
Crocheting.

29
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,600
Crocheting, I'm sorry.

30
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,600
There's a difference, right?

31
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,040
It's a double half crochet, to be specific.

32
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,760
Also say hello to somebody who probably doesn't know the difference between crocheting and

33
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,760
knitting.

34
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,200
Tech master, Loki.

35
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,200
Maybe I do.

36
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,200
Oh, maybe.

37
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,200
Oh, do you?

38
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,200
Okay, guess.

39
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,200
What's the difference?

40
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,200
The difference between crocheting and knitting?

41
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,120
Here's your clue.

42
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,760
Just the tools used to do it?

43
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,080
I really don't care.

44
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,080
Yes.

45
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,460
Anyhow.

46
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,880
What is this, a video game podcast or a show about knitting?

47
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,880
I don't know.

48
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,160
Maybe that's a spinoff show you should have there on soccer.

49
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,000
I am sending a hat to one of our listeners.

50
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,280
I know you're doing a comic show.

51
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,100
To our friend Rob.

52
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,100
Not this Rob.

53
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,100
Not you.

54
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,100
You're making me a scarf.

55
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,100
I'm making you the gayest scarf ever.

56
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,100
I want a rainbow Doctor Who scarf.

57
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,100
That's what I asked for.

58
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,100
It'd be fun.

59
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,100
Alright, hi.

60
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,100
Who cares?

61
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,400
We're here, of course, every week live Sunday nights, 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time right

62
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,980
after the Bobby Black Wolf show live at All Games Radio.

63
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,780
Big thanks to them for letting us steal their bandwidth every week.

64
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,280
It's www.allgames.com.

65
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,520
If you want to check out our own website and our show archives, you can head over to www.orangeloungeradio.com.

66
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,920
Tonight we're going to start off the show as we always do with a little bit of how was

67
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,720
your gaming week.

68
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,440
Dark Sakura, I know her voice is kind of bugging her.

69
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,480
I'll go to her anyway and ask how our gaming week was.

70
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,800
Or better yet, you know what?

71
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,080
I bet I could guess.

72
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,960
I'm going to do my impersonation of Dark Sakura's gaming week.

73
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
You ready?

74
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,960
Right.

75
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,960
Okay.

76
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,980
First off, I played Star Trek Online and I saw some Borg and it was cool.

77
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,320
I didn't find any Borg.

78
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,320
I fought the Gorn.

79
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,680
Then I watched my husband play a first person shooter.

80
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,680
No.

81
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,400
But it made me sick, so I decided to play Peggle.

82
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,400
Peggle!

83
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,400
No, I haven't played any Peggle.

84
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,400
I found a fuck.

85
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
I thought that was pretty good, Loki.

86
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
I don't...

87
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,240
Why do you sound like Clarence from Wonder Shosen?

88
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,240
I don't know.

89
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,760
What are you running from?

90
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,120
I did play Star Trek Online.

91
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,120
Of course you did.

92
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,120
I did shoot the Gorn, not the Borg.

93
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,480
The Gorn of the Lizard People.

94
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,480
Oh, okay.

95
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,320
And it was excellent.

96
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:28,480
And then I played Solitaire on my iPhone and did not play Peggle.

97
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,480
I found a Flash version of Bust-a-Move, or Puzzle Bobble.

98
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,520
And then we got out some obscure game system from the vault and hooked it up and played

99
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,520
it.

100
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,520
No.

101
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,520
We played Chrono Trigger.

102
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,520
I'm sorry.

103
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:48,480
We played Super Nintendo, and Dan was playing Ninja Gaiden 3, because we have the Ninja

104
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,960
Gaiden trilogy on this mess.

105
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,960
I'm sorry.

106
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,960
How dare I say an obscure game?

107
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,360
Rob.

108
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,480
What?

109
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,040
Love you, mean it.

110
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,720
You did bring me coffee, so I forgive you.

111
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,720
All right.

112
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,720
Do you want to try and do my gaming week?

113
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,240
Do you want to try and do my gaming week?

114
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,240
Well!

115
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,240
Pretty close.

116
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,240
Pretty close.

117
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,240
Let's go to Loki next, though.

118
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,240
How was your gaming week, Loki?

119
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,560
I just played lots of Grand Theft Auto.

120
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,560
Actually it was funny.

121
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,600
I didn't run into him, but my co-workers ran into somebody that was actually cheating.

122
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,320
Like they had their console modded in a modded version of the game, and they were cheating

123
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,320
that way.

124
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,320
But granted, we could do that again, but I just don't want to have to have all these

125
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,560
banned consoles sitting around, you know?

126
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,560
Sorry.

127
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,560
Can I just say in chat?

128
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,920
Of course, I haven't given them a shout out yet, but we always welcome our chatters every

129
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,920
week.

130
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,160
You can go to OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to join us live on this Sunday evening.

131
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,880
If you're listening via the podcast, there's other ways you can interact with us.

132
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,280
Our Twitter feed at OLR, our Facebook at OrangeLoungeRadio, or of course our mailbag.

133
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,280
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

134
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,500
VidPower's live in our chat tonight and says, do Loki next.

135
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,800
Play GTA IV then worked on Arcade Cabinet.

136
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,240
That would be the Loki impersonation.

137
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,880
No, that's about right.

138
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,880
No.

139
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:11,560
So we, I watched him play this guy, and you know, it was just stupid, but still winning.

140
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:22,680
I actually, I think I'm now in the 80s for, what was it, the true skill rank in a single

141
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,000
death match.

142
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,740
So that's kind of cool.

143
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,840
So top 80 players of the world.

144
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:36,400
And then in just the cumulative death match ranks, I'm about to break 200.

145
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,380
So I'll be in the top 200 there, which is cool.

146
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,920
And I still frustrate my coworkers a lot because I win all the time.

147
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,920
That's okay.

148
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,000
You frustrate your co-hosts too.

149
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
That's all right.

150
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,200
That's not because I win all the time.

151
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,560
And then I played more Borderlands, so that was fun.

152
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,560
And just kind of working a little bit through that.

153
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,800
And download the two expansions for that, so hopefully I'll play those soon.

154
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,800
And then finally, did work on my Arcade Cabinet.

155
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:14,080
I replaced the graphics card that was in there with a much faster one, and much better one.

156
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,560
Because before I had an Arcade VGA card, because they were meant to output to an Arcade Cabinet.

157
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,040
Well, you can do it with other graphics cards, but you have to run a special driver to do

158
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,040
it.

159
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
And so I did that.

160
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,640
And it finally took me forever to get the work right.

161
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,080
But now I can play my Niomi games full speed.

162
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,360
I can play Street Fighter IV full speed.

163
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:45,160
The only thing I can't play full speed right now, that I really wish I could, was my Taito

164
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,440
X games.

165
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,760
Like BlazBlue Continuum Shift is still kind of slow, so I would need to get a slightly

166
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,920
newer graphics card to get that one to work just right.

167
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,920
I think.

168
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,120
Because the one I have right now, the graphics card is only 64-bit, which I should have bought

169
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,920
a newer one, but whatever.

170
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,920
So most of it works.

171
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,920
Alright.

172
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,920
Anything else you want to add?

173
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
Nope, that's it.

174
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,920
Alright.

175
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,080
Let's see, DarkSakura was kind of right when she was doing the impersonation of me there.

176
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,200
I did play a little bit of WoW this week, still leveling the characters.

177
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,400
You know what my payback is going to be for poking fun at DarkSakura.

178
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,640
Not making fun, poking fun.

179
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,920
I tease because I love, I'm going to catch whatever she has, so I'm going to be here

180
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,920
next week.

181
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,760
Oh come on, let's watch radio.

182
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,460
No, you're going to be laid up for three days, not able to get out of bed.

183
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,960
And that'll suck because I'm supposed to move next week into my new place, so I really don't

184
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,960
want to get sick.

185
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:45,560
Remember, remember, friends help friends move, real friends help friends move bodies.

186
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
Alright.

187
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,560
Anyhow, let's see.

188
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,440
I put the fun in Dysfunction.

189
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,640
My game week.

190
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,380
Not just WoW, I did play some other stuff too.

191
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:56,960
Although I did ding 37, I'm almost 38.

192
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,400
Anyhow, on my warrior.

193
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,680
Has to be said in a row.

194
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,680
Shut up.

195
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,480
Let's see, other games I played this week, because I did play some other stuff.

196
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,320
Okay, you remember last week on the show, if you listened to last week's show, I was

197
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,880
squeaking all over the place because Blaster Master Overdrive was coming out on the Wii.

198
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:18,640
Which is, you know, this sequel, if you will, to the original Blaster Master on the NES.

199
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,560
You know, of course there was a version on the Genesis and Game Boy as well, but we're

200
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,040
just kind of, I guess, assuming those didn't happen.

201
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,400
And this kind of came out of nowhere.

202
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:30,520
It was released this week on WiiWare, and so of course Monday I go home from work, automatically

203
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,160
download this thing right away, and I spend a little time with it, and I'm sure everybody

204
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,320
wants to know my thoughts because I was so excited and I was happy about it last week,

205
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:44,240
and so I played it, and well, I guess maybe I overhyped it a little bit.

206
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,240
It wasn't all that.

207
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,760
Well, here's the thing, it wasn't bad.

208
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,560
It just wasn't what I thought it could have been.

209
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,800
A couple things I noticed right off the bat is that it did not support 16.9.

210
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,360
It was, it still had the black bars on the left and right side of the screen on my widescreen

211
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,400
TV.

212
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,960
The controls were a little weird, like I know the vehicle is supposed to control a little

213
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,480
odd, but I felt like they overcompensated in the Blaster Master game.

214
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,480
One of the things that kind of bugged me is I felt the different stages didn't have a

215
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,720
lot of differentness between them.

216
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,360
There wasn't a lot of uniqueness between the levels.

217
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,640
One level was cave, and it had brown walls, and one level was outdoors, but you go into

218
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,080
a cave right away.

219
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,180
The other level was like ice cave, and you have blue walls, and when you go into the

220
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,720
overhead areas, they're not that exciting.

221
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:38,360
They look like the dungeons from the 8-bit Willow on the NES, just different variations

222
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:44,320
of a little maze like that, and I wasn't all that floored with it.

223
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,840
But then you have to look at the other side of it.

224
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,480
The game was only $10.

225
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,080
They did Metroid it a little, like you have save points, you have maps, I don't like the

226
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:56,240
way they did save points because only certain caves have save points, and sometimes you

227
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,320
don't want to drive around for 20 minutes looking for a save point.

228
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,600
I wasn't as thrilled with the save system as I guess I could have been, but then again,

229
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,160
you think back, a lot of old games you'd have to look around a while for a save system.

230
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,840
You know what kind of weirded me out about Blaster Master Overdrive?

231
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,400
Here's the thing about the game.

232
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,860
I kind of felt like I was playing a game, and I really give this a lot of thought because

233
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,720
how did they turn this around so quick?

234
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:27,200
I felt like I was playing a game that had been made for another system and then finished

235
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
for the Wii.

236
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:35,160
I seriously think what I played was made for the PS1 or PS2, and then for whatever reason

237
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,000
it didn't happen, it came out on the Wii instead.

238
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,320
That's what the game kind of felt like to me.

239
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,080
It felt like a mediocre PS1 game just suddenly now on the Wii.

240
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,760
But again, the value, $10, the music kicks ass, a lot of the remixes are really cool,

241
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,480
and there is that nostalgia factor.

242
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,680
My only other big bitch, and this is damn near a game-ruiner for me, this is why I can't

243
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,980
play Blaster Master Overdrive for long periods of time, the controls blow.

244
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:09,920
They absolutely blow, and it's one really logical flaw that makes it blow.

245
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,560
You use your Wiimote tilted to the side like an NES controller, and all the buttons pretty

246
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,560
much are used.

247
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,260
You use the A button, the giant one, to switch weapons.

248
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,520
You use the 1 button to fire your weapon, which makes sense.

249
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:26,640
You use the 2 button to fire a super weapon, which you do once in a great while, and you

250
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,520
don't want to hit that inadvertently.

251
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,480
And then you use the trigger button on the back of the controller, while you're holding

252
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:39,960
it like an NES controller, to strafe, which if you want to be very successful in the first-person

253
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,720
or whatever you would call them, it's not even Jason, I think it's Alex now, in the

254
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,200
Alex areas, if you want to be successful, you have to be able to strafe.

255
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,240
And using the trigger button when you're trying to hold it like an NES controller to strafe

256
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,240
sucks.

257
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,020
Like, you're not holding it, like, I don't know who thought that, and that's the first

258
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,020
thing that made me think.

259
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:03,160
Why can't they just do it the old way, where you would just hold the fire button down,

260
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,320
and then it would just stay firing in that one direction, and you can move around and

261
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,780
strafe, and then you just basically let go of it, and turn, and then hold it down again

262
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,200
to shoot a different direction.

263
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,080
Or just be able to remap the buttons the way I want them.

264
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,320
Like, you know, most games have a options menu with controls.

265
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,840
Well, maybe they'll patch it back in.

266
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,840
Oh wait, they can't, that's right.

267
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,840
Oh wait, no, it's the Wii.

268
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,840
It's the Wii.

269
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,680
You can't patch on the Wii, so forget it.

270
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,580
And ActDeft asked, does it have classic controller support in our chat room?

271
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,580
It does not.

272
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,240
You can only, which I thought was a glaring omission too.

273
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,260
You can only play it with the NES controller, or I'm sorry, NES style regular Wiimote tilted

274
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,560
to the side.

275
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,560
The controls blow.

276
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,520
I was really irritated that I couldn't remap it, and that's the first thing that made me

277
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,520
think.

278
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,040
I think someone just brought this over from like PS2, and thank you chat rooms for reminding

279
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,760
me, Dartitsuya said they did release a Blaster Master on PSX, they did.

280
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,720
So I don't know if this was like a sequel that they started to make, or a PS2 version,

281
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,720
I don't know.

282
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,760
Or again, I'm hypothesizing just based on what I played, it didn't feel like it was

283
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,760
made for the Wii, because I think if it was, it would have supported 16.9.

284
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,160
So the controls really kind of ruin it for me.

285
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,680
And it's too bad, because at the end of the day, it still seems like there's a fun game

286
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,840
in there somewhere, and for $10 it's still not a terrible deal, it's just I would urge

287
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,040
you to go spend your money on the original, honestly.

288
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,040
That's what I'd do.

289
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,760
So that was Blaster Master Overdrive.

290
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,320
Other stuff I played this week, Castle Crashers, randomly, for some reason that game came out

291
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,600
what, almost a year ago, and I'm just now getting around to playing it, for real.

292
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,380
Spent some time playing that game in two-player local mode, and the only problem I have with

293
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,940
it is that sometimes it gets to be a little bit monotonous, as all of those old games

294
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,840
like the Ninja Turtles game, and the games that's based off of Final Fight and all that

295
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,040
do, it's just, you know, kick, punch, punch, kick, kick.

296
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,480
But I gotta say, that's like the only negative I can think of.

297
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,200
I think, as far as Castle Crashers goes, I love how they have all these little in-jokes

298
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,960
and they really souped it up, and they added some things into it, like, you know, fighting

299
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:05,800
each other to see who can kiss the girl, and the little power-ups, and the magic.

300
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,320
You know, I think they did definitely take that genre of gaming to the next level.

301
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,240
So I was, you know, definitely Castle Crashers is a good buy, if you haven't already bought

302
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,400
it, I mean, it's like, what, the best-selling Xbox 360 arcade game, so I imagine most of

303
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,400
you own it.

304
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,880
I'm slow in getting around to some games, okay?

305
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:29,000
And then, I didn't really play a whole lot else in depth, but I watched my boyfriend

306
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,080
play tons of games because he got a brand new monitor this week that's like a 25-inch

307
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,440
monitor, it's huge, it's very similar to Dan's monitor, it's gigantic, and I just watched

308
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,880
him play, like, Left 4 Dead 2 and Half-Life 2, like, every neat-looking game he owned,

309
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,240
he had to load within the scope of, like, two hours, and it was pretty, I will admit,

310
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,480
it was pretty, and you know I played WoW on that thing, too, and it was very pretty, very

311
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,480
pretty.

312
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,560
Anyhow, that's about it for our gaming weeks, so we're gonna move on, we'll get into some

313
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,200
news here in just a moment, but first, we want to take some housekeeping.

314
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,120
It is Valentine's Day, so for those that are celebrating Valentine's Day, happy Valentine's

315
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,760
Day, hope it was a good one.

316
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,840
For those that aren't, well, take a moment to celebrate what you really love today, video

317
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,840
games.

318
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:14,040
Join our chat, chat.orangelandrado.com, and talk about the latest in gaming news this

319
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,800
week with us, and of course our Twitter and all that other stuff as well that I mentioned

320
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,800
earlier.

321
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,720
Okay, let's get into some actual news tonight.

322
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,120
X10 event, lots of news, right, Loki?

323
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:30,280
Yes, lots of interesting news, some of which was being covered by, well, about Dead Rising

324
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:36,480
2, which they announced will be coming out August 31st in the US, and then coming out

325
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:43,520
later on in Japan and Europe later this week on the 2nd and 3rd of September.

326
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:50,280
And if you remember, I mean, the original Dead Rising came out, I think, 07 or 08, around

327
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:54,480
the same time, I know it was in August, but that's pretty cool.

328
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,200
And then some of the stuff they were also showing off about it, apparently, of course,

329
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:03,440
since this, you know, being X10, they announced that they're going to have an exclusive to

330
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:12,520
Xbox Live, Dead Rising 2 K0, which is a prologue to the sequel of the game, and will kind of

331
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,080
work as a game add-on.

332
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,300
And not only that, it's basically going to be the demo for the game.

333
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:24,920
So you'll get to kind of get your Dead Rising on slightly earlier than the game actually

334
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,920
comes out.

335
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,700
Well, now, Loki, demos are usually free.

336
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,320
And I'm guessing this is not going to be free.

337
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,720
Um, maybe, yeah.

338
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,480
Well, okay, maybe.

339
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,240
I mean, maybe I'm not giving enough credit, I mean, if it's just going to be a giant advertisement

340
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,520
for the game, maybe it will be free, who knows, but I just kind of doubt it.

341
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,520
I don't know why.

342
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,520
I'm being skeptical.

343
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,840
You never know.

344
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,840
History shows this kind of crap is usually not free.

345
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,440
Oh, we have a special guest here on tonight's show.

346
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,440
Hold on.

347
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,440
Say hi.

348
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,440
This is...

349
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,440
No.

350
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,440
Who's our special guest tonight?

351
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,440
This is Julian.

352
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,840
Wait, we can't hear in the mic.

353
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,840
This is Julian.

354
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,840
Hi, Julian.

355
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,840
How old is Julian?

356
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,840
He's two.

357
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,380
Julian's two and has the best shoes in the world.

358
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,380
They're lighting up.

359
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,380
Julian, sit up.

360
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,240
Do you like video games, Julian?

361
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,240
He says no.

362
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,040
Tell them in the microphone.

363
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,040
Do you like games?

364
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,040
No.

365
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:19,840
Well, then, I don't know if we're going to be able to talk too much on the show tonight.

366
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,840
Do you want mommy?

367
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,600
Do you like to play the guitar?

368
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,600
I think he's afraid of the microphone.

369
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,760
Oh, no, he's not afraid of the microphone.

370
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,240
He's just being obstinate.

371
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,760
He's being too.

372
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,400
All right, anyhow, sorry, Loki.

373
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,400
Go ahead, Dead Rising.

374
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,400
Okay.

375
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,640
So, Dead Rising, case zero, should be coming out shortly before the release of Dead Rising

376
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,640
2.

377
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,640
So, expect it this summer.

378
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,640
That's Rob.

379
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,640
All right.

380
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,280
It will have achievements and all that good stuff, though, right?

381
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,280
Yes.

382
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,440
You know what would make a good, by the way, we have comments in chat room, chat.orangeonstrader.com.

383
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,040
Black Wolf in chat, our good pal, Bobby Black Wolf, who's on before us every Sunday at All

384
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:06,320
Games Radio, says, Julian, sounds like the ferret.

385
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,320
We need to get him to say, excuse me.

386
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,320
All right.

387
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,440
No, he's the one to look in the garage.

388
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,600
Because that's where all the pinball machines are, huh?

389
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,600
He loves the garage.

390
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,600
Of course.

391
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,600
Of course he does.

392
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,600
All right.

393
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,600
He's a boy.

394
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,600
Sorry.

395
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,600
We let a two-year-old derail the show, but that happens.

396
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,600
He doesn't like games, though.

397
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,600
I know.

398
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,920
No, he goes back there and watches his dad play on his Xbox all the time.

399
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,920
He just doesn't.

400
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,920
His dad's playing Mass Effect 2.

401
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,120
He doesn't like the nerds playing this show.

402
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,120
He just has to get used to everybody.

403
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,120
I know, I know.

404
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,120
He's like a cat.

405
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,120
He's got to warm up, too, a little bit.

406
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,440
Okay, so, anyway, back to Dead Rising.

407
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,200
You know, what I think would be an interesting kind of demo is, I heard this kind of like

408
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,200
as a rumor.

409
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,200
I don't know if this is true or not.

410
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,280
Loki, maybe you've read up on this.

411
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,440
I heard they took the picture-taking thing out of Dead Rising 2.

412
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,440
That's not part of the game now.

413
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,440
That is not part of the game.

414
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,720
Well, wouldn't that make like a neat little download thing?

415
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:55,080
Like I took pictures of zombies or something like, you know, Dead Rising Snap.

416
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,660
No, I don't know.

417
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:02,600
Maybe if it came, well, it's been on the Wii, so maybe they could do a version of that,

418
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,040
like on the Wii.

419
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:08,800
But no, I don't know if that, I mean, it'll be fun, because I remember I played the first

420
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:14,880
Dead Rising demo a lot, because it was like a 15-minute demo or something like that or,

421
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,040
you know, a pretty decent-sized demo and you could just run around killing zombies and

422
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,040
that's it.

423
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,040
Same thing with Saints Row, the 15-minute, or it was the 30-minute demo for that, and

424
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,880
I think Crackdown had that, too.

425
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,960
But those are really good demos, and so, you know, if it's like a prologue to the game

426
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,440
and with some additional content, yeah, I'll check it out, definitely.

427
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,880
So I mean, Dead Rising's awesome, so.

428
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,480
Yeah, I mean, I enjoyed Dead Rising, too.

429
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,160
It was kind of a pleasant little surprise.

430
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,000
So I'm kind of curious where they're going to go with the sequel.

431
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,720
I like the picture-taking thing, though.

432
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,440
That was the whole opening of the first game, was like taking pictures, wasn't it?

433
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,280
Yeah, but see, he's not a journalist this time.

434
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:53,280
This time, he's like, you know, a duct tape expert, because, you know, that's...

435
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,480
Is that an actual job?

436
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,480
You can like...

437
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,200
What would you study in college to become a duct tape expert?

438
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,600
Fusion, I would imagine.

439
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,880
All right.

440
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,520
Let's move on to some other Xbox Live-related news, and this has to do with some of the

441
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,920
other things that were teased at the X10 event.

442
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:16,400
For example, instead of doing a Summer of Arcade this year, I shouldn't say instead

443
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,600
of, they'll probably still do the Summer of Arcade, they're going to do what's called

444
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,560
a block party in the month of March, and that's what Xbox Live is going to be doing.

445
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:29,320
The first game that's going to come out on March 3rd is called Toy Soldiers.

446
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,520
Scrap Metal is coming out as well, as well as Perfect Dark.

447
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,440
That's right, they're going to do a remake of Perfect Dark, and that's coming out on

448
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,880
Xbox Live Arcade this March, and also, kind of coming out of nowhere, Game Room is coming

449
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,880
out.

450
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,400
It has been confirmed that that will come out in March, so at least we have a target

451
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,400
date for that.

452
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,080
I'm guessing, just kind of out of the blue, though, that will be the last week of March.

453
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,840
That's going to be the big last thing.

454
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,840
What's getting the last slot?

455
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,840
Or Perfect Dark?

456
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,400
One of the two is probably getting the last slot.

457
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,720
I don't know.

458
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:07,760
I had to say I got to watch a little video of the Perfect Dark playthrough, and it was...

459
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,360
Can you jump in this one?

460
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,360
I believe.

461
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,360
I saw him jumping.

462
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,600
It's just a remake of the N64 one.

463
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,120
Well, you can't jump in the...

464
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,120
I don't know.

465
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,880
Well, by the way, some of the price is already out for some of those as well.

466
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,920
Perfect Dark will set you back $10, 800 Microsoft points.

467
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,160
Toy Soldiers and Scrap Metal, $15 a piece, that's 1,200 Microsoft points.

468
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,680
Of course, Game Room is free to download, but it will cost $3 if you want to play it

469
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:37,160
on one system, either your 360 or your PC, 400 Microsoft points or five bucks for both,

470
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:43,120
or 50 cents, 40 Microsoft points for one play, which I always thought it was supposed to

471
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,040
be two plays, two quarters for two plays, but I guess they scaled it back to one.

472
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,040
So there you go.

473
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:53,080
Those are the prices of the games coming out on Xbox Live in March.

474
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,600
So definitely a very busy month.

475
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,720
Anything you guys are looking forward to?

476
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:01,120
I mean, I'm all about Game Room as much as I'm a little bit irritated that I've bought

477
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,020
a lot of those games before.

478
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,080
You know what else I played this week?

479
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:10,880
The other night, I think Alan was playing WoW or something, and I was there hanging

480
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,840
out, and I just fired up old Atari 2600 games.

481
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,520
I started playing Pitfall 2, The Lost Caverns.

482
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,280
I was playing that for a little bit, and then I was playing an old, old game called, and

483
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,160
I can't remember the name now, Dragon Fire, I think it was called.

484
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,520
It was, there was two modes to it.

485
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,240
One was where you were running across the drawbridge and you had to dodge the fireballs,

486
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,280
and then the second screen was you had to collect all the treasure and dodge the fireballs

487
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,280
from the dragon.

488
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,840
I think it's called Dragon Fire.

489
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,000
I played those games for like an hour.

490
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,540
It's crazy.

491
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,520
So I'm all about Game Room and playing some of the classic games again, as long as it's

492
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:48,160
not stuff I've already bought, so I won't be buying Scramble, thank you very much, or

493
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,360
Frogger, or Tempest, or anything else that's already been on Xbox Live.

494
00:22:51,360 --> 00:23:01,040
I'm not buying Frogger just despite Frogger, because I hate the just incessant whoring

495
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,560
out of Frogger.

496
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,200
Konami, get a new game to whore out, seriously.

497
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,200
It's not Frogger itself, the classic game that you have a problem with, it's the incessant

498
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,760
whoring of the franchise and what has become.

499
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,640
They have made me hate the original game of Frogger now.

500
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,920
Well, I remember when they first came out with that Frogger game on PS1, it was awesome.

501
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:22,040
Like that first Frogger revival game was awesome when it first came out, but then it's like,

502
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,080
that's all they make now.

503
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,960
So I don't know.

504
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,440
But the original Frogger's okay.

505
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,440
My favorite Frogger, Hello Random, was on the Commodore 64.

506
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,720
It was called Frogger 2 3 Deep, and it was three different screens.

507
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,160
You had a sky screen, and a ground screen, and an underwater screen.

508
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:47,380
And you could go between the three screens, or you could dock your frog at the end of

509
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,800
one particular screen.

510
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,800
It was weird.

511
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,320
You know what?

512
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:57,720
My memories of Frogger were of being in fourth grade on roller skates playing at the skating

513
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,600
rink in Dothan, Alabama.

514
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,960
There was a roller rink in Roseville, California that I used to go to.

515
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,960
I think it's still there.

516
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,960
It's called Roller King.

517
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,920
I used to play Spy Hunter in the arcade there.

518
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:16,080
They had that same Frogger machine for at least ten years, and I would play it every

519
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,480
summer on roller skates.

520
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,640
Lots of Frogger hate in our chat room, chat.orangehonker.com.

521
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:27,120
Ray Ayanami says Frogger sucks, Spyro says Frogger is scary, ToaGak says Frogger go get

522
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,120
hit by a car.

523
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:33,960
To this day though, I play Frogger best on roller skates on an arcade machine.

524
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,000
I play Spy Hunter best on roller skates, which always fascinated me because it had a gas

525
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
pedal on those machines.

526
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I'm sure the roller skates did not.

527
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,560
I would like to see Frogger Shattered Soldier.

528
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,560
The funniest thing I ever saw.

529
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,560
With the Kiriyamaoka doing that.

530
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:49,080
I think this was in Chico, at a roller rink in Chico, California where I went to school

531
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,080
for college.

532
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,280
They had a DDR machine in a roller rink, and the first time I ever saw that I was like,

533
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,640
you know something bad is going to happen on that machine.

534
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,800
Some idgits gonna hop up on there and try to play in roller skates.

535
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,360
Now Hitstun is showing the other side of the spectrum here.

536
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,360
One other comment about Frogger.

537
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,240
I don't know how we got on this tangent and then we'll go to Dark Sakura with another

538
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,240
news story.

539
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,280
But Hitstun gives another side of the token here.

540
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:17,000
Frogger is a great first video game for kids.

541
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
That's a valid argument.

542
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,920
I think it's a good kid video game.

543
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,920
Loki?

544
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,720
Do you think he has a point?

545
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,920
They want to turn him off of video games because they're going to frustrate the hell out of

546
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,600
them.

547
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,120
I can look at it as an educational tool for hand-eye coordination.

548
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,120
You want a good first kid?

549
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,120
No, if you think about it-

550
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,400
It's a classic excuse we use with our parents.

551
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,080
Mother, I'm working on my hand-eye coordination.

552
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,080
The best idling-

553
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,080
Go on.

554
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,080
Dark Sakura, sorry.

555
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,660
But you're dealing with the concept of objects in motion.

556
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:55,880
So honestly, and I've actually found a study on this a few years ago where they were talking

557
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:01,080
about games like Frogger as being ones that teach about physics in motion.

558
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,080
So-

559
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,480
Well, but couldn't you learn hand-eye coordination from Street Fighter IV?

560
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,520
You know, let the kid get his butt kicked a little.

561
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:13,360
But it's the whole point of things moving in opposite directions of, you know, horizontal

562
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,200
versus vertical movement, you know, spatial relations.

563
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,160
All right, fine.

564
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:24,860
Azure Edge, in chat, by the way, jumped in and said Battle Toads was his first game.

565
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,000
It's a game that gets you-

566
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
There's a game.

567
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Sick of-

568
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I can already tell you what mine was.

569
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Pong.

570
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Oh, of course.

571
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,640
And then kangaroo.

572
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,880
I don't remember what my first first game was, but I have really early memories of playing

573
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,880
combat.

574
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,980
It was probably combat when the family got an Atari 2600 and Spider-Man.

575
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:45,220
I remember going in my mom's bedroom where the Atari 2600 was hooked up so that she could

576
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,000
limit my play time to play Spider-Man.

577
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,240
We always had crypt equip at my friend's house because we had an Odyssey 2.

578
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:59,320
Now when I was- the first system that I think I owned myself, that and then just given to

579
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,440
me, but one that was bought for me, was my ColecoVision.

580
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,060
We played a lot of Turbo and Mouse Trap, Adventure and Gorf.

581
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,960
I always wanted a ColecoVision, but my mother-

582
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,960
I think I have two.

583
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,200
My mother wouldn't give me one because she says we have an Atari 2600, we don't need

584
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,200
the other one.

585
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,200
Which, you know, she made a point.

586
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,200
The ColecoVision, I'm sorry, was far superior.

587
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,200
All right.

588
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,000
Especially since I had the expansion module that you could play Atari 2600 games on.

589
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,520
Plus once we got the Commodore 64, that's really all I played for years and years.

590
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,440
I didn't even touch the 2600 anymore, it was all about the Commodore 64, that thing was

591
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,440
awesome.

592
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,440
What was it?

593
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,440
The TI-85?

594
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,440
Nice.

595
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,440
Yeah.

596
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,440
Okay.

597
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,440
Sorry, let's move on with more gaming news.

598
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,440
Okay.

599
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,440
Back to- fast forward to now.

600
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,440
Sorry.

601
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,440
Sorry.

602
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,440
I really shouldn't have been talking that much too.

603
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,440
That's okay.

604
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:49,440
Well, Halo Reach Beta has a date, it's May 3rd, but only if you already have ODST.

605
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:57,200
At the X10 event, Microsoft made the announcement that the multiplayer beta was going to begin

606
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:04,440
for the ODST owners, so that means you have to actually have the ODST disk to access the

607
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,440
beta.

608
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,880
So, yay, I have it.

609
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,760
Well, yeah, I mean, it makes sense.

610
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:15,240
I mean, the people that are going to want to play Halo Reach right away already have

611
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,240
Halo ODST.

612
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,200
I mean, it makes sense.

613
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,680
I imagine if you're a Halo fan, you know, it's not like they're pairing it with a

614
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:26,800
game like Crackdown, where you have to kind of go outside the genre to pick up this game.

615
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,360
Like, remember when the Halo 3 beta came with Crackdown?

616
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,720
You had to buy this completely different game to get access to the Halo 3 beta.

617
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,720
Crackdown was fun, though.

618
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,020
Yeah, although it turned out, I mean, thankfully, Crackdown was a pretty good game, but imagine

619
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,360
if it hadn't been.

620
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,960
You know, that could have been a bad thing.

621
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,120
But it makes sense that they're doing it that way.

622
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,960
I have to tell you what the joy of Crackdown was for me.

623
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:56,160
It was coming in the house and having Dan and Will play Crackdown, going, I like jumping!

624
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,360
And that little high-pitched voice, I like jumping!

625
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,360
I like jumping!

626
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,360
Okay.

627
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,360
I know.

628
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,960
And then it gets stuck in my head.

629
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,880
So every time I think about Crackdown, I instantly hear Dan and Will in my head going, I like

630
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,880
jumping!

631
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,240
Well, you won't have to worry about that when Perfect Dark comes out.

632
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,240
So, all right.

633
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,240
I like not jumping.

634
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,600
Loki, what do you think of the whole Halo thing?

635
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,440
I mean, for me, I'm like, oh, darn, I would have liked a free demo that I could download

636
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,440
and play, but I can't hate on what they're doing.

637
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,800
They did the same thing with Crackdown, of course, they did the same thing.

638
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,400
So I'm not surprised that they're doing the same thing with this.

639
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:36,440
So I really don't care, because I didn't play much of the Halo 3 beta, and I just can't

640
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,800
see myself playing much of the Halo Reach beta.

641
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:45,080
I mean, Halo Online for me is just not that big.

642
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:49,640
I mean, yeah, no offense, I understand why people love their Halo, but I haven't really

643
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:55,320
been into it myself since Halo 2, which, as we talked about last week, I'm not going to

644
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:00,680
be able to play much longer anyway online, unless, as many folks have speculated, Microsoft

645
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:07,400
does a Halo 2 for the Xbox Live Arcade, like a revival, which wouldn't surprise me at all.

646
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:13,760
But I didn't really get into Halo 3 that much, so I can't see myself getting into these other

647
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,760
ones.

648
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,280
Even my college buddies call me up and say, Rob, you gotta get Halo Reach so we can all

649
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,280
play again.

650
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,280
I'd probably do it.

651
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,280
We'll see.

652
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,280
Let's move on.

653
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:26,640
Loki, you have a lot, a lot of news here, coming from another presser.

654
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,160
Yes, EA, they had a bunch of stuff coming out.

655
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:36,040
I want to say it's from their end of the fiscal quarter stuff, and they released their tentative

656
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:41,400
release schedule for fiscal 2011.

657
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:51,960
So running from April, or I guess, yeah, April to April 2011.

658
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:57,440
And of course, some stuff's not a big surprise, you know, sequels to big franchises.

659
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:04,720
One that's already been teased already, Dead Space 2 is slated for early 2011.

660
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,640
I didn't really say when, I guess Q4 of 2011.

661
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:14,280
So somewhere between January and March of 2011, you can expect that one to be coming.

662
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:21,640
Of course, on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, I believe they're skipping the PC version

663
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,040
this time around.

664
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:30,120
Some other things also been teased before and are coming by holiday of 2010, Crysis

665
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,800
2, which was on the cover recently of one of the game magazines, supposed to be taking

666
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,020
place in New York.

667
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,360
And Sims 3 will be making its way out to consoles.

668
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:49,160
Also NBA Jam coming this holiday, and EA Sports MMA, supposed to be coming out between October

669
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,620
and December of 2010 as well.

670
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:58,160
And some other smaller stuff also being put out.

671
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:02,920
Of course, new Harry Potter, tie in with the Deathly Hallows.

672
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:08,560
And those games make money, those Harry Potter games, they make money, and they've only got

673
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,560
a little bit left.

674
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,440
Actually, they'll probably still find a way to crank out those games even when the games

675
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,440
are done.

676
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,200
Oh yeah, I can see them doing some, you know, hell, they did Lord of the Rings games for

677
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,200
the longest time.

678
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,120
They have another Lord of the Rings game coming out.

679
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,520
Harry Potter MMO.

680
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:27,000
You know someone wants to do it.

681
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
It could be Epic.

682
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,380
Do a Harry Potter MMO with all the people I know that are like really into the Harry

683
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,000
Potter fandom.

684
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,840
Just log on to LiveJournal, you'll find tons of people that love Harry Potter.

685
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,560
That would get Nellie playing MMOs.

686
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:45,320
I'm telling you, I am kind of shocked there isn't already one talked in development.

687
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,560
That'll be the game somebody makes once all the other games are done.

688
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:52,560
That would be awesome, just totally unrealistic and never gonna happen, but wouldn't it be

689
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:58,920
awesome like the next game that Blizzard is developing is Harry Potter MMO.

690
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,820
Just like something ridiculous.

691
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:06,560
You know what, if Blizzard were making that, even I would have to play it.

692
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,980
I really would, because you know what I've said, Blizzard really doesn't make bad games.

693
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:15,280
They haven't made a bad game in about 25 years, you know, Blizzard doesn't really make bad

694
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,280
games.

695
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,080
Some other games coming out.

696
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:26,920
Between July 1st and September 30th, the real time world's crime themed MMO, which this

697
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:33,060
will probably get me into MMOs as well, APB, or what I like to call Scenes Bro Grand Theft

698
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,320
Auto Online, which would be awesome.

699
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:42,760
And then of course, the next Medal of Honor game, right now slated for the summer as well.

700
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:49,880
Actually, no I take that back, it's sometime between now and March 2011, so anytime I guess

701
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,820
for Medal of Honor.

702
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:57,520
And let's see, to kind of go with the more casual crowd, they're gonna be doing some

703
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:03,040
new EA Sports Active games, which are due out around this holiday, and of course it's

704
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:11,720
not surprising, but they're going to be possibly working with the Microsoft Project Natal and

705
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,800
the Motion Controller Arc, or whatever the hell they're gonna call it.

706
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,120
Those games have been doing pretty well, and I've actually, I gotta say, I played those

707
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:23,440
games myself, and I had a bitch with them, and my bitch was you couldn't skip exercises

708
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,920
that the system was not recognizing you as actually doing, due to the limitations of

709
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,980
the Wii motion recognition, which ticked me off.

710
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:34,800
That was my one bitch that was almost a game-ruiner for me, but from what I hear of people that

711
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:40,240
are playing it regularly, it's a better workout than Wii Fit, because it's a more organized

712
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,800
kind of workout, and they have you do different types of exercises than Wii Fit does.

713
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,160
Everything's kind of centered around the board in Wii Fit, whereas they kind of remove that

714
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,160
in EA Sports.

715
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:54,480
I mean, granted, they have the ribbon, and you can use the board if you have it, but

716
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,880
a common misconception about EA Sports, or EA Active, you do not need the balance board

717
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,880
to play it.

718
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,440
It comes with the little wrist strap thing that you don't even really use.

719
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,440
The resistance bands.

720
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,760
Well, yeah, the resistance band, I'm sorry, not the wrist strap, the leg strap.

721
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,440
You put this thing on your leg and you put the Wiimote in it, so it senses when you're

722
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,380
running a little better.

723
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,160
I would rather just have real resistance bands.

724
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,400
They are real resistance bands.

725
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,560
Well, then that's the only reason I've won it, because that's a better workout.

726
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,920
Nothing is going to replace the gym and eating healthier.

727
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,720
But it will probably be a little bit better than fake hula hooping on the...

728
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,720
Yes, exactly.

729
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,480
You know what, though, I think that a great way to lose weight is?

730
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,480
Stomach virus.

731
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,480
Tape worm.

732
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,480
Tape worms, too.

733
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,600
Not my favorite way to lose weight.

734
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:46,720
I mean, when I had pancreatitis, I lost like 45 pounds, but I also almost died, which kind

735
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,720
of sucks.

736
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,720
Tape worms win-win, too, because you probably have to have bad meat in order for that to

737
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,320
happen, and very raw meat is delicious.

738
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,080
All right.

739
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,360
Was that it, or is there more EA?

740
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,360
Oh, there's more.

741
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,360
Just real quick.

742
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:02,480
Of course, Dragon Age will be getting a sequel in early 2011 as well.

743
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,080
Well, now this is important, because Dragon Age was pretty badass.

744
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:10,680
And what's also interesting, though, is it will be making its way out to portables as

745
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:15,000
well, the DS and PSP, or possibly cell phones.

746
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,360
And PZ?

747
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,880
Epic Dragon Age is very epic, so I'm not surprised at all that there's a sequel.

748
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,880
I'm kind of surprised it's coming out.

749
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,880
Sequel the successful franchise?

750
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,880
No.

751
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,200
I'm kind of surprised it's coming out so fast, but there you go.

752
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,200
Well, it's not...

753
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,360
It's only, what, a year since the last one?

754
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,000
Yeah, but this is coming out in 2011.

755
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I mean, it'll be over a year.

756
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,960
Oh, they didn't say, like, beginning 2011.

757
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,960
They said...

758
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,960
Well, that's...

759
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,960
The first...

760
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,960
Okay, 18 months, maybe.

761
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,880
It'll probably be the same engine.

762
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,840
That's really a long time in the gaming world.

763
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,840
I guess.

764
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,840
I mean...

765
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,840
True.

766
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,920
I mean, they've already put out, like, what, at least two of those EA Active games, if

767
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,600
not three or four, and there's gonna be even more, but still.

768
00:36:54,600 --> 00:37:00,480
I mean, that's like, yeah, it's like a one-tenth of a Duke Nukem Forever.

769
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,280
All I'm saying is that, you know, they just make sure you take the time to get it right.

770
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,280
That's all.

771
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,040
Mass Effect 1 and 2 probably had a similar gap between them, right?

772
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:11,000
Mass Effect 1 and 2 is probably, what, about 18 months, or maybe two years, right?

773
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,720
Maybe somebody in chat knows better.

774
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:19,140
And Mass Effect 1, I believe, was November 08, and so, yeah, it's about the same.

775
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:23,520
There's people out there proclaiming Mass Effect 2 is the greatest video game ever made, period.

776
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,080
It's supposed to be better because it's, you know, the combat's a lot better.

777
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,120
It actually looks interesting, but I'm not gonna buy it because...

778
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,920
Well, it's on my to playlist, but I gotta be honest with y'all.

779
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,820
I have been a Final Fantasy fanboy since the very, very first one that, you know, my friend

780
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:43,440
and I used the strategy guide made by Nintendo Power to get through.

781
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,140
I will be buying Final Fantasy XIII.

782
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:48,160
You probably won't hear me talk about anything but that until I beat it.

783
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,160
Oh, yeah.

784
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,160
Anyhow.

785
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:57,240
Of course, that didn't really happen with Final Fantasy XII, but I blame XII a whole

786
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,960
... XII should not have been on the PS2, but that's for another day.

787
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,360
Go back and listen to old episodes if you wanna know more thoughts on that.

788
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,360
All right.

789
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,360
So, I don't know.

790
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,720
Anything out of EA real quickly before we move on with the news that makes you very

791
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,720
excited?

792
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,560
I think the Dragon Age story's pretty cool and NBA Jam I'm certainly looking forward

793
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,560
to as well.

794
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:19,680
I think NBA Jam's gonna be a letdown because the EA NBA games haven't been that great.

795
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:27,000
And then, you know, unless they make it control more like a traditional NBA Jam game, that's

796
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,580
the only way I can see that being good.

797
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:35,320
But either EA, the NBA Live game's not good on the Wii.

798
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:40,360
In fact, they sold so poorly that they didn't put one out this year.

799
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,360
2K did.

800
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:46,280
Akuma JP in chat says, don't get your hopes too high though, Rob.

801
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,280
That's a good point.

802
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,000
I've heard Final Fantasy XIII's been getting some slack, the whole like no towns thing

803
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,800
and it's linear.

804
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,480
But yeah, well, and also I should know better than to get my hopes highs or my hopes high

805
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,960
very high for a game because that's what I do with Blaster Master.

806
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,960
Don't we just need Blitz?

807
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,960
NFL Blitz?

808
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,960
Oh, I'm talking about Final Fantasy, but whatever.

809
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,960
Oh yeah.

810
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,960
Yeah.

811
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,960
Well, Final Fantasy's gonna be awesome.

812
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,320
Well, that's what Akuma's saying, be careful, don't hype it too much because it might not

813
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,320
be all that.

814
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:16,160
Well, the people that have been playing the Japanese version, you know, it sounds good,

815
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,160
so.

816
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,160
Alright.

817
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,320
Well, moving on to some, I don't know, this is kind of a mixed bag of news.

818
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,440
It's good news and bad news.

819
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:28,880
Activision plans on reducing the number of Guitar Hero, Band Hero, and the Music Hero

820
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,440
franchises that they do in 2010.

821
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,440
And this is coming word of mouth from the Activision Publishing CEO, Mike Griffith,

822
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,600
who, of course, they had a conference call this week saying that fewer SKUs will serve

823
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,040
as a broader audience.

824
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,880
In 2009, we released 25 music SKUs.

825
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,880
In 2010, we plan to release less than 10.

826
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,360
Now, of course, the speculation is, okay, well, they're gonna do away with probably

827
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,360
the PS2 bundles.

828
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,600
They can't be selling very well.

829
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,520
And probably a lot of these bands, specific games and so forth.

830
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:03,760
And, you know, they do a lot of game and then game plus plastic instrument, game plus plastic

831
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,760
instruments.

832
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,000
I mean, they're gonna be cutting back on those.

833
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,440
I imagine a lot of these are gonna be game only, right?

834
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,080
They'll leave the bundling to the Costco's of the world, right?

835
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,080
Maybe.

836
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:18,080
Well, I think, and although you're gonna hear that there's just less music games coming

837
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:22,640
from them, which I think we all kind of view as a good thing, we knew Guitar Hero was getting

838
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,640
too saturated.

839
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:28,640
This whole Guitar Hero Van Halen, Guitar Hero 5 band hero all coming out within like a month

840
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,640
of each other.

841
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,640
Too much.

842
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,640
Too much.

843
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:36,000
Unfortunately, when you talk about making a decision like that, which we do say is a

844
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
good thing.

845
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,960
The bad news is they're gonna lay off people because they don't need them anymore.

846
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,560
And some different companies really got hit hard with layoffs this week.

847
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,280
I heard Neversoft really got hit hard.

848
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,980
Also, Underground Development who made the Guitar Hero Van Halen game and they also did

849
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,880
a Dave Mirra BMX series.

850
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,040
They just, they've been slaughtered completely.

851
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,040
They're out.

852
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:03,000
Also, surprisingly, kind of an end of an era for us here at Orange Lounge Radio.

853
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,040
You know, this show started because of Dance Dance Revolution.

854
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,260
We all met playing DDR at the arcade and talked about music games.

855
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:12,900
And if you've ever been to a DDR tournament, especially back in the day, it was probably

856
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:17,800
sponsored by a little company trying to sell their DDR pads and their expensive mats that

857
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,200
would help you do a better DDR game at home.

858
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,160
Red Octane, that's how they started.

859
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:27,240
And of course, as you know, Red Octane teamed up with Harmonix for the first Guitar Hero

860
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,240
game.

861
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,320
Red Octane has been shut down.

862
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:37,080
Only the staff that is directly involved with instrument development will stay at Activision,

863
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,520
otherwise the rest of it's gone.

864
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,160
So it's kind of the end of an era in ways.

865
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,800
So I don't know, what do you guys think?

866
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,760
Having been fans of music games and kind of knowing Red Octane and seeing their peeps

867
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,640
out at DDR tournament, what do you think?

868
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,320
I saw this coming from the moment of the acquisition.

869
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,320
Did I say it?

870
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,400
It's sad but true, yeah.

871
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,480
I could see that.

872
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:01,320
I knew they were gonna squeeze what they could out of them the moment the money got bad.

873
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,320
Cut.

874
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,320
Loki?

875
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,320
I'm not surprised.

876
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:08,400
They've been cutting a lot of different smaller studios and stuff, but...

877
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,800
Oh well.

878
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,200
Guess we're not gonna get In The Groove.

879
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,760
Actually, I gotta say, that is...

880
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,960
Now the In The Groove fanboys can finally shut the fuck up.

881
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,960
I mean, seriously.

882
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,960
Ugh.

883
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,960
It's just not gonna happen.

884
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,640
Go away.

885
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,840
Duke Nukem Forever will happen before that.

886
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:31,480
So anyhow, yes, also as mentioned, let's see, what else?

887
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,880
Luxa Flux was shut out as well.

888
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,000
Neversoft employees were hit.

889
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,880
Half of Radical Entertainment staff, I mean, it's just...

890
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,080
It was not fun times at Activision this week.

891
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:49,240
So of course, you know, although we have some harsh things to say about some of those games

892
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,360
in development, it's never good news to talk about people losing their jobs.

893
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,640
So we hope those folks are able to find employment.

894
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,600
Hopefully a new studio will spring up, maybe to create a new type of music game or a new

895
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,040
type of peripheral-based game.

896
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,040
I'd be all about that.

897
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,040
Just know In The Groove.

898
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,240
Maybe.

899
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,040
Well, how about something...

900
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:14,660
A different type of sacking altogether.

901
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:19,560
For anyone who was interested, and I'm really not one of them, but I know people who were

902
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:26,880
more interested in the Alan Wake game, they actually announced that the PC version is

903
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,880
not going to be happening.

904
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:35,400
The Xbox 360 version of Alan Wake will be out on May 21st, but it will not be out on

905
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,400
PC.

906
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,400
It just will not work.

907
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,800
Well, I don't know.

908
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,040
Is this surprising or no?

909
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:47,160
I mean, in a way, a lot of these games now are developed with the console in mind first

910
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,600
and then the PC secondary.

911
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,400
So if it didn't work, it didn't work.

912
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,280
But still, if you're still a PC gamer at heart, and I gotta say, I was watching Alan play

913
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:00,440
Bioshock this week just for a little bit on his fancy new monitor, and he's got a video

914
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,440
card and everything.

915
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,880
I was like, dang, in a lot of ways, this looks better than it does on the 360.

916
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,640
I mean, there's still a lot of good stuff in PC games.

917
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,800
Well, I have to tell you, because keep in mind, now I'm playing Star Trek Online with

918
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:18,840
an old video card, and I'm gonna be upgrading mine soon, but I've seen screen captures for

919
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:24,320
people who've played on, like, you know, the newest GeForce, and it's amazing.

920
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:29,400
So really having the right card makes all the difference with a lot of PC games.

921
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,120
You know, even, okay, here's an example, Rob.

922
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:37,800
Sonic R, which I have on Saturn, and I have on PC.

923
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,800
And I played it back in the day when I got a new Radeon on the PC.

924
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:48,800
Same game, either way, played so much better on the PC, looked cleaner, so it does make

925
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:54,600
a difference if your computer's a little bit better than spec, you know what I mean?

926
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:59,360
Part of me thinks I'll be playing Microsoft Game Room more on my PC than I will my 360,

927
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:03,320
because, well, I won't have to use the 360 controller on my PC.

928
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:08,840
I can get a decent pad for, like, 15 bucks with the working.

929
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:15,400
I hate the D-pad, though, playing a classic game on that's gonna blow, so, unless Microsoft

930
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,640
releases a new pad, which I doubt they will.

931
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,860
I still want an adapter so I can use my Saturn dual analog controller.

932
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:23,440
The best controller ever.

933
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,680
I am interested in Alan Wake, though, I will throw that out there.

934
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,680
I do want to play that when it comes out among all the other, my gosh, games to catch up

935
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,680
on this year.

936
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:35,040
By the way, quick follow-up to the last story we were talking about, I just decided for

937
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,960
YouTube, Shits and Giggles, to go to redoctane.com, and now forwards you automatically to the

938
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,160
guitarherostore.com.

939
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,960
It did for the longest time, actually.

940
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,960
Did it?

941
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,040
Not a single mention of Red Octane anywhere, except at the way, way bottom of the page

942
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,200
in the tiny, tiny fine print.

943
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,200
Yeah, it's been like that for a while.

944
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,200
All content's coming, right?

945
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,200
99, 2010.

946
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,700
I just, well, I just haven't had a reason to visit this site in a long time.

947
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,820
So I don't know, maybe this has been in the works for a while.

948
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:02,420
No mention of DDR on here anymore, but they do sell the soft dance pad and the hard dance

949
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:05,120
pad, but they don't say what for.

950
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:10,000
Course there's a lot of games that use those dance pads now, not just DDR.

951
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,760
Anyhow, let's travel around the globe and check out some upcoming release dates for

952
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,800
things on systems you will be able to get.

953
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:25,920
Yes, this week, in fact, today, you can pick up your Wii remote in blue or pink, just in

954
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:34,320
time for Valentine's Day, and so that you know what sex your Wii remote is.

955
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:39,520
On the Wii will be Data East Arcade Classics coming out this week, so you can get your

956
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,360
BurgerTime and your bad dudes on.

957
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,360
Well, that's cool.

958
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,040
Is that coming out on any other systems or just Wii?

959
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,040
Just Wii.

960
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,040
Huh.

961
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,040
Are you a bad enough dude to say the president?

962
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,480
I know, I was gonna say bad dudes.

963
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:56,840
And it also has the BurgerTime sequel on there.

964
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,880
I've played the BurgerTime sequel.

965
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:07,000
It's, well, it's a typical sequel to an arcade game where the original was more fun in your

966
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,880
memories than the sequel was.

967
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:15,580
Dynasty Warriors Strike Force coming out this week on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

968
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:21,440
So come US Navy Seals, Fireteam Bravo 3 finally making its way out after quite a few delays.

969
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:28,040
On PSP this week, Aliens vs. Predator coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and PC.

970
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:33,560
Uh, Jay would be happy to know that Ragnarok, formerly known as Ragnarok Online, will be

971
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,000
making its way out for the DS this week.

972
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,680
Yay, playing it in English.

973
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:42,680
Tropico 3 coming out on Xbox 360 this week.

974
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:48,240
Ace Attorney Investigations, Miles Edgeworth making its way out on the DS.

975
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:55,360
The sequel to the music-making game, Korg DS10 Plus, making its way out on the DS.

976
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,360
Is that why Korg is in the keyboard?

977
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,360
Yes it is.

978
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,360
Sweet.

979
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:04,400
Chicken Riot, a budget shooter game coming out on the Wii.

980
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:11,240
Um, let's see here.

981
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:22,920
Prerunning making its way out on the Wii and Deadly Premonition coming out on Xbox 360

982
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:23,920
this week.

983
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,400
Kind of a budget horror game.

984
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:31,880
And the PC Collection of Strong Bads, cool game for attractive people making its way

985
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,280
out as well.

986
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:39,480
And it looks like a re-release of the, oh no, actually this might be the original Fallout

987
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:44,920
trilogy on PC for $14.99, not bad.

988
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:45,920
That's it.

989
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,000
Okay, let's go over to Japan and check out what's coming out over there.

990
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,360
Some localized versions of games you might know from over here.

991
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:56,040
Starting off on the 360, February 18th, you're gonna get Biohazard 5, which of course over

992
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:59,560
here is Resident Evil 5, now that is the Platinum Collection, obviously the game's been out

993
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,560
a while over there too.

994
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,040
It's just getting a price drop.

995
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:06,480
Dante's Inferno makes its way, a version for Japan coming out this week on the 18th, as

996
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,760
well as Eat Lead, the return of Matt Hazard coming out on the 360.

997
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:14,360
Heading on over to the Playstation 3, of course you also get Biohazard 5 there, but they call

998
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,240
it the Alternative Edition.

999
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,520
I don't know if this is just simply a price reduction or if they were adding something

1000
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,520
to it.

1001
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,160
It might be the Gold Edition that's coming out over here in March.

1002
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,160
I think it is.

1003
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,160
I think it is.

1004
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,040
So it's like the, you know, souped up a little bit.

1005
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:31,280
Also of course, Eat Lead and Dante's Inferno also on the PS3.

1006
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:35,280
Also on the PS3, something that had a demo here in the States this week, Heavy Rain,

1007
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,800
the Origami Killer, comes out on the 18th in Japan.

1008
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:45,240
Also in Japan, Shin Sangoku Mosu Online, Kamishu Rambu comes out.

1009
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:48,160
It's Sangoku Wars, but you do online.

1010
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:52,240
It's 24 players that you can team up and defeat other players.

1011
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,440
It's kind of like an action game.

1012
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:58,680
You make your own warrior, customize, look, body shape, and voices.

1013
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,680
Isn't that Romance of the Three Kingdoms?

1014
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,680
Yeah.

1015
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:03,680
Is it?

1016
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,440
It looks Dynasty Wars-ish.

1017
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,320
It has the combo meter and everything.

1018
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,320
Probably a mix of the two.

1019
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,000
It is from Koei, so it's probably.

1020
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,360
There's one that might be their version of Strike Force, or there's a Samurai Warriors

1021
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,920
game coming out.

1022
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,440
Kind of cool, though.

1023
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,280
Is there a localized version of that?

1024
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,600
Well, Sangoku is three kingdom, or three lands.

1025
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,600
No, but I mean, is that particular game out here?

1026
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:38,520
I don't know if that one's coming out exactly.

1027
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,880
By the way, there is a premium version of that if you want as well.

1028
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,560
Also, quickly, big release for PS3 in Japan this week.

1029
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:47,320
Skate 2 gets a price reduction, Uncharted gets a bundle pack this week.

1030
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,080
Next week, Demon's Souls is getting a price reduction.

1031
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,000
That was a pretty awesome PS3 exclusive.

1032
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,280
Nothing on the Wii this week in Japan, which is somewhat surprising.

1033
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,520
That's because next week is a pretty big week.

1034
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:02,560
They have a lot of games, including the Tales of Symphonia, getting a price reduction.

1035
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,160
That's next week, though.

1036
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:09,240
PlayStation 2, of course, the Pickens are getting a little slimmer there on PS2, but

1037
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,120
they have a game called Last Escort.

1038
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:15,240
Club Kaze is coming out in regular and limited editions.

1039
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:21,800
The DS gets Yu-Gi-Oh!, 5Ds World Championship 2010, Reverse of Arcadia.

1040
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:26,440
So if you're still playing Yu-Gi-Oh!, you're in for a treat this week in Japan.

1041
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:37,520
Obviously on the PSP this week, Last Escort as well, and, let's see, SOCOM, Fate Unlimited

1042
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:44,440
gets a price reduction, Densetsu no Yu-Shan no Densetsu Legendary Saga comes out as well.

1043
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:48,360
So a lot of little games here and there on the PSP this week, so there you go.

1044
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:49,360
That does it for Japanese releases.

1045
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,440
Okay, well, in the UK, we've got a small list.

1046
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:56,840
We have on the 18th, Puzzle Chronicles on DS and PSP.

1047
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:04,400
19th, we have Ace Attorney Investigations, Miles Edworth, Aliens vs. Predator, Dynasty

1048
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:09,840
Warrior Strike Force Special, Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney, Justice for All, and Real Fishing,

1049
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:10,840
Angler's Dream.

1050
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:13,840
And that's it for me.

1051
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:17,560
All right, just a few more stories for you guys, and then we're going to get to the

1052
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:22,360
classic video game of the week, because we just wouldn't have a show here at OLR if

1053
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,080
we couldn't have our classic game of the week.

1054
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,560
But a few news stories first, Loki.

1055
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,560
Yes.

1056
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:35,480
During, I guess, an acceptance speech at the Japan Media Arts Festival, Miyamoto was referring

1057
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:41,440
to an unannounced Nintendo hardware, and at least one new Wii project he's working on,

1058
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,280
which uses the Wii Motion Plus peripheral.

1059
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,560
And of course he didn't make any formal announcements or anything like that, but apparently there

1060
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:55,000
is something being worked on, and I guess we'll just have to wait to find out what exactly

1061
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,720
that is.

1062
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,120
But I'm not surprised that there's new hardware coming.

1063
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,800
I would guess probably a new handheld.

1064
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:05,200
I know, hasn't there just been rumblings, and it seems like we've had stories, little

1065
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,720
hints dropped by Nintendo for quite a while now that there is some type of motion-enabled

1066
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:13,120
DSi coming out, or like a DS2 or something.

1067
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:16,120
That's going to be dumb.

1068
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,120
Well.

1069
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,120
Well, okay.

1070
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:21,200
The DS isn't a bad system, it's just flooded with shovelware.

1071
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:25,880
I'm not saying it's dumb that they're putting out, okay, well I am saying it's dumb that

1072
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:28,840
they're putting out another system, but the reason why I'm saying that is because they

1073
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:34,280
just came out with the DSi, what, like a year ago.

1074
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,280
Come on.

1075
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,280
Well, think about when we were transitioning into the DS.

1076
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:42,640
I remember the year we were there at E3, seeing the DS, it was our first E3, the year they

1077
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,120
showed off the DS for the very first time.

1078
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,580
Remember what else they were showing off?

1079
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:47,880
The micro advances.

1080
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:48,880
At the same time.

1081
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,080
And there were people saying, well, who the hell would want to buy a micro advance when

1082
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,720
they just announced the DS?

1083
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:54,720
But the micro-

1084
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,720
Jamie bought one.

1085
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,680
I didn't, I do not say that I bought one.

1086
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:58,680
I did not.

1087
00:53:58,680 --> 00:53:59,680
Oh, I'm sorry, Jamie.

1088
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:00,680
Obtained one.

1089
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:01,680
A required one.

1090
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,680
A required one.

1091
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:03,680
Okay.

1092
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,680
Here's the difference, though, between that, though.

1093
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:08,040
Whereas the DSi is being treated as a new platform, I mean, they are now starting to

1094
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:15,320
put out DSi exclusive games, and then, you know, they're going to probably slowly phase

1095
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:19,380
out the DS stuff, I guess, I don't know why they would do that, because they have so many

1096
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:20,380
right now.

1097
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:25,240
But to put out yet another hardware platform that's going to be a portable system, that's

1098
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:30,440
kind of like, what the hell, I mean, say you just bought a DSi, you know, and it's got

1099
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:34,720
a, you know, it does have, you know, feature enhancements compared to the DS.

1100
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:38,440
It's not just, look, we made it smaller, or look, we made it larger, or look, we made

1101
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:39,440
it purple, you know.

1102
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,560
A camera, and memory storage, or whatever the DS I had.

1103
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,240
Memory storage, the download service.

1104
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,840
I never bothered with DSi.

1105
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,120
I barely play my DS anymore.

1106
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,120
Well, exactly.

1107
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:51,360
I didn't either, but the thing is, you know, if they're going to put out, like, a motion-enabled

1108
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:56,680
platform as well, you know, that's not compatible with this, I mean, seriously, how many times

1109
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,160
are they going to get you to buy the DS?

1110
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:01,200
Well, I guess, how many times did you buy the Game Boy, so.

1111
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,520
Well, how, hasn't every Nintendo handheld just been an evolution of the previous one

1112
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,080
of some sort, and they've all kind of been backwards compatible?

1113
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,800
Well, I think at this point, they're going to have to come out with something new, like,

1114
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,800
new new, you know, new hardware platform, period, you know.

1115
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,040
They'll still play DS carts.

1116
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,040
It will.

1117
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,040
That's fine.

1118
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,040
Whatever, baby.

1119
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:19,040
I'm not buying it.

1120
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:23,760
I'm telling you right now, I'm not paying for another, you know, handheld.

1121
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,440
Because they're turning into Apple, where, you know, every year there'll be something

1122
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,240
bigger and better and newer.

1123
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,240
Hmm?

1124
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,760
And I'm not touching Apple stuff either.

1125
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:35,800
All right, well, here's something maybe Loki could play that is for a Nintendo system,

1126
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,360
and I think this would be pretty exciting.

1127
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:46,080
It's a game being developed by Epicenter, and they have combined the games Guitar Hero

1128
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:51,060
and Typing of the Dead to bring you Rock of the Dead.

1129
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:56,440
So you use a rock band or Guitar Hero controller on your Wii, and you use it to basically kill

1130
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:00,560
undead by playing different, you know, fret patterns, or hitting different buttons on

1131
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:03,400
the guitar will allow you to kill zombies.

1132
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:07,640
So I don't know if that sells you guys right there, but then they also go on to say they're

1133
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:08,640
serious.

1134
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:13,120
They've brought in some, like, uber nerdy star-tep power into this game.

1135
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,440
Neil Patrick Harris will be the voice of the main character.

1136
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,640
Felicia Day will also be doing a voice.

1137
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:19,880
I mean, I can't think of, like...

1138
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:23,560
So they're taking the cast of Dr. Horrible's sing-along blog.

1139
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:27,720
Well, if you want to go nerdy, I mean, that's the way to do it.

1140
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:28,720
Don't get me wrong.

1141
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,920
Get Elijah Dushku and Sarah Michelle Gellar and all the other Weednights.

1142
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,440
This would be a great idea coming from Sega.

1143
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:40,600
The problem is with this is you basically have something that is knocking off House

1144
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,600
of the Dead.

1145
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:46,560
I mean, even knocking off Typing of the Dead, instead of a keyboard, it's the fret buttons.

1146
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,240
I'm sorry, there's going to be a lawsuit.

1147
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,640
I mean, seriously, the names are too familiar.

1148
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:55,040
It feels like, you know, Zombie Rock or something like that.

1149
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,560
The names are too similar.

1150
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:00,040
The presentation's too similar.

1151
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,520
The gameplay's too similar.

1152
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,520
It's going to be...

1153
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:03,600
They're going to have a lawsuit.

1154
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:06,480
You think Sega will sue to get the name changed?

1155
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,480
I think...

1156
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:08,480
I like Zombie Rock.

1157
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,960
I think they will sue them, because, let me put it this way.

1158
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,480
This company is putting this out of conspiracy.

1159
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,480
There are nobody.

1160
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:18,720
I mean, they're like really small development house, so...

1161
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:19,720
You know what, though?

1162
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:22,880
I like it when small studios have good ideas, though, and I gotta say, when I look at the

1163
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:23,880
Sega...

1164
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:24,880
It's not a good idea!

1165
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:25,880
They just ripped someone else off!

1166
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:26,880
Oh, hey!

1167
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,180
Typing of the Dead would be awesome if I didn't have to find a keyboard and I could just use

1168
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:30,180
a guitar.

1169
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:35,280
But, though, I'll be honest that I had this discussion with someone about them doing another

1170
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,640
Typing of the Dead with a different peripheral.

1171
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:40,160
Like I was thinking, you know, drumming of the dead.

1172
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,680
And I want to reiterate, Neil Patrick Harris is awesome.

1173
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,440
Well, great for Neil Patrick Harris.

1174
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:47,360
He needs, you know, money, too, to pay the bills, but I'm sorry.

1175
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:51,840
It's still a rip-off, and there's nothing...

1176
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,760
I mean, it looks exactly like...

1177
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:58,640
If this Rock of the Dead came out and they didn't say who made it, who would you think

1178
00:57:58,640 --> 00:57:59,640
made it?

1179
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:00,640
Yeah.

1180
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:01,640
Because it sounds like House of the Dead.

1181
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:02,640
It looks like House of the Dead.

1182
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,320
I would have said, yes, Sega's getting funny.

1183
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,320
Yes, exactly.

1184
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:08,080
I mean, it's a rip-off, and I'm sorry.

1185
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:11,520
It's kind of a bummer Sega didn't think of it.

1186
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:15,920
It is a bummer, but, you know, at the same time, they probably won't make it out, at

1187
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:16,920
least not under that name.

1188
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:20,520
I'll give you the honest reason I'm not interested in this game, despite the voice talent behind

1189
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,880
it, is that I'm not buying a guitar for the Wii.

1190
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:23,880
Exactly.

1191
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:25,240
I just have to borrow one.

1192
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,240
Flailing.

1193
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,240
I would totally play it.

1194
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:28,240
I would totally play it.

1195
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,040
The Dreamcast keyboard for Typing of the Dead.

1196
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:36,320
I love Typing of the Dead on Dreamcast, but I would totally play this, too, on the 360.

1197
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,320
Flailing of the Dead.

1198
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:43,000
By the way, did you know that they have the air guitar controller?

1199
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
No.

1200
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I saw one at Fry's.

1201
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Satar of the Dead?

1202
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,640
No, an air guitar controller.

1203
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:50,640
I know.

1204
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:51,640
This is crazy.

1205
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:53,340
It's a great idea.

1206
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:58,840
More power to them if they're able to launch it without a lawsuit, but, I mean, seriously.

1207
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:02,660
I'm trying to think, haven't there been, like, parody games before that were obvious play

1208
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:03,660
on titles?

1209
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:07,480
I mean, granted, I mean, there's, you know, Dawn of the Dead and stuff like that, you

1210
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:11,680
know, Day of the Dead, whatever, but, okay, House of the Dead.

1211
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:16,320
A zombie shooter, okay, that had a version that wasn't with a light gun.

1212
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:20,480
It was with a keyboard, and you entered in commands, and it killed the zombie.

1213
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:24,200
This is basically the same thing, except it's a guitar controller.

1214
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,200
And the movie sucked.

1215
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,200
And I'm sorry.

1216
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:32,320
You know, it's just not different enough, and it will have a lawsuit.

1217
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:34,080
It's what's gonna happen.

1218
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,720
I love this from our chat room.

1219
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:36,940
Chat.orangehomesradio.com.

1220
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:41,600
This can only be brought to you from our chat room, is that, you know, why not take an old

1221
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:44,960
Sega, if Sega wants to cash in on this, take a Sega peripheral that hasn't been used in

1222
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:54,920
a while, and bring us Samba de the Dead, Samba de la Muerta, I'm gonna maraca the zombies

1223
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:55,920
to death.

1224
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:56,920
I would play the hell out of that.

1225
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:59,920
I would play the shit out of that game, especially if Neil Patrick Harris did a voice.

1226
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,120
You know what, Rob?

1227
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:07,240
Maybe we should have that as a side to our land party, have a maraca booty shaking contest

1228
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,240
going on in the other room.

1229
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,640
I think Samba de la Muerta should be a dream game.

1230
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,640
I don't know.

1231
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:12,640
I'm thinking that's...

1232
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:15,520
We should have that, and, of course, Rod Caliber.

1233
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:20,080
Yeah, but Rod Caliber's kind of already been done.

1234
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,040
Samba de la Dead or whatever?

1235
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,040
Awesome.

1236
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:29,800
Anyhow, boy oh boy, okay, let's take a different direction here in the show and take a look

1237
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:34,600
at gaming's past, and take a trip down memory lane to figure out what the classic game of

1238
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,600
the week is.

1239
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:39,800
Because every week, Dark Soccer likes to take a trip through the vault and find a game that

1240
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:44,040
she says, hey, you ungrateful kids, you ought to be playing this game.

1241
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,640
And, of course, she picked something from the ColecoVision this week, right?

1242
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:47,640
No.

1243
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:48,640
No.

1244
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,640
Maybe next week.

1245
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:50,640
I said, get off my lawn!

1246
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,560
Alright, she said, get off my lawn, and then decided to...

1247
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:53,560
Go play this!

1248
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:54,760
This should be the classic game of the week.

1249
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:58,600
So what is your classic game of the week, Dark Saga?

1250
01:00:58,600 --> 01:00:59,600
Doom.

1251
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,800
Doom is the classic game of the week.

1252
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:06,000
Because it had a level called Hurt Me Plenty, and I loved it.

1253
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,480
Well, a difficulty level.

1254
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:14,120
So, yeah, it's a first-person shooter from, uh, it's id Software, right?

1255
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:15,120
Or id.

1256
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:20,680
I always remembered just all the cheat codes for it, like iddqd for, what was that, all

1257
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:22,680
weapons or god mode?

1258
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:29,040
Yeah, iddqd was, I think, god mode, and then id level skip, and then idbfg for all the

1259
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,040
weapons and crap.

1260
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,040
No, I...

1261
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:33,560
BFG, that was just the, uh, big fucking guy.

1262
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:34,560
The big fucking guy.

1263
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:35,560
KFA.

1264
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:36,560
That was it.

1265
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:37,560
But anyway, yeah.

1266
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:44,760
Um, I played a lot of Doom, a lot of Doom when it came out on, um, my friend's 486,

1267
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:49,320
and basically you're a dude and you're in hell, kinda.

1268
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:52,920
Um, you're just going around and shooting things and going all the way to the levels

1269
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,920
and killing demons and yay.

1270
01:01:54,920 --> 01:02:04,080
Um, there were also, um, this gave us a term that we had before the coining of, you know,

1271
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,040
first-person shooter, I really think.

1272
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:07,460
And it was Doom Clone.

1273
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:11,680
How often did we use the term Doom Clone back in the day?

1274
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,400
Oh yes.

1275
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,720
There were tons of Doom knock-off games though, tons.

1276
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:20,000
But from there we had, uh, Doom 2 Hell on Earth, and by the way, the first Doom came

1277
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
out in 93.

1278
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:30,440
Um, Doom 2 was 1994, um, Ultimate Doom 1985, Master Levels for Doom 2, Final Doom in 1996.

1279
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:32,400
Even Doom was copying Doom.

1280
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,400
Yeah.

1281
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:41,600
Um, but, now there's also, um, Doom Resurrection that came out, um, last year in June, um,

1282
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:46,840
for the iPhone, which I haven't, um, played, but it's a parallel to Doom 3.

1283
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:53,320
Um, Doom 4 was stated for being in production, but there's nothing out on it yet.

1284
01:02:53,320 --> 01:03:01,000
Um, but yeah, it's first-person, you can get a chainsaw, you can get, you know, the BFG.

1285
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:06,560
Um, you can, um, there's just all kinds of, like, weird stuff also hidden in the game

1286
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:07,560
too.

1287
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:14,000
Um, like in, uh, Doom 2 you have a bunny called Daisy that's, you know, impaled on a steak,

1288
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,200
and you have to get vengeance for it and crap.

1289
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:23,340
And then, um, I mean, basically it's just going through.

1290
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:28,020
If you play it on the weakest level and then you try to get through, um, to, uh, the last

1291
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:31,320
level, um, it doesn't let you play the last level.

1292
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:34,780
I know the screen goes black because I hear a brrrr.

1293
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:43,020
Um, but the, the reason why, the reason why I'm bringing up Doom is because of the, um,

1294
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:48,200
the home hacks, the wads, all kinds of different versions.

1295
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:55,020
Like there's a Ghostbusters one and, um, there was a Gotchamon one, Alien, Sailor Moon, I

1296
01:03:55,020 --> 01:04:01,100
the Dragon Ball Z one back in the day. It's all these people who would just go and, you know,

1297
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:07,180
change out the sprites and everything. And also, also, also, the other thing was skipping to the

1298
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:13,020
hidden Wolfenstein level. Wolfenstein was the game I would mod. Not so much Doom, but I had

1299
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:18,220
the Mortal Kombat characters for Wolfenstein. That was a lot of fun. Well, I also, though,

1300
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:27,260
honestly, I prefer them for Quake, but we had Doom first. And I think that Doom is really the reason

1301
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:33,500
why we've got, you know, just the massive tons of first-person shooters that we have today.

1302
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:38,140
I kind of want to play this on Xbox Live later. Like, I want to have an epic frag fest on Doom

1303
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:43,260
later. I used to play, um, this is actually the one that this video is from is Ultimate Doom,

1304
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:50,460
which I played quite a bit of it on the Nintendo 64. But really, this was the game I learned my

1305
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:55,500
appreciation for PC gaming on because it was from this that I was playing Duke Nukem 3D,

1306
01:04:56,460 --> 01:05:00,460
you know, where you could do your own voice macros and everything. And this was the game I learned

1307
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:07,180
to do deathmatching on, you know. On top of that, I can play Doom without getting motion sick.

1308
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:13,580
Wow. Because it's sprite based. Well, that's right. You had the whole like, um, like sprites

1309
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:19,900
don't make you sick. Sprites don't make me sick. But polygons do. Interesting. I mean, and even so,

1310
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:26,540
if it's running really smoothly, I can get kind of sick. But I was playing Hexen, you know, for

1311
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:36,620
a long time. So this one, though, I have a lot of fond memories of it being 1995 and going to hang

1312
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:42,140
out. This was no, I take the back 94 my first year of college and going to hang out my friend

1313
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:47,980
Marci's house playing Doom, playing Doom and Phantasmagoria. Do you remember that game?

1314
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:52,220
Yeah, Phantasmagoria just came out on the good old games website this week. I don't think it's

1315
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:56,620
in tonight's show. I don't remember if we talked about last week, but Phantasmagoria old is new

1316
01:05:56,620 --> 01:06:02,540
again. But, you know, it we were playing this and Loom. I was playing Loom when I was playing Doom.

1317
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:09,500
I played a crapload of Doom dude. I used to call into a BBS that specialized in doing the Doom 2

1318
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:13,500
networking. So you would call into this BBS and you do these settings. I don't even remember what

1319
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:17,180
you had to do with so long ago. And then you'd launch Doom 2 and you could actually play and

1320
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:21,340
this, this BBS like would charge like you'd get like an hour free and then like you had to pay

1321
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:25,420
for more hours. So of course we'd keep re registering new accounts and like putting in

1322
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:32,940
fake phone numbers and stuff. Well, I'll tell you, um, you know, uh, that same year of school we had

1323
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:43,980
our Mac lab and keep in mind it was the old, you know, the big rectangle, uh, box tall Macs with

1324
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:51,420
the crappy keyboards and shit. And mine had a black and white version of Doom on it, you know,

1325
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:56,300
so I was playing Doom and black and white in class and getting a D in the class. This is a

1326
01:06:56,300 --> 01:07:00,300
great game of the week because I think especially for you younger folks out there to listen to the

1327
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:04,540
show, like I know even though we, we swear a lot more than we should on this show and so kids

1328
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:08,300
shouldn't listen to our show. I know there's some of you in like that 16, 17 range that listen to

1329
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:13,020
this program. And if you're one of those folks, if you want to see what gaming was like when we

1330
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:20,220
were 16, I mean not to be all like, I walked uphill back, but let's face it, we're getting old

1331
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:25,420
cause we've been doing this show for eight years. But I still get carded. This was the game I would

1332
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:30,700
play when I was 16. So if you want to see like a real game that we grew up on and loved, it was

1333
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:35,020
Doom is a great example. Now you're making me feel a little because I was in college when I was

1334
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:41,260
playing Doom. Doom came out when I was in 11th grade, but I was playing it more when I was out

1335
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:52,140
of it. My computer that I had was a TI and I had a Coleco Adam. I would use the school's Apple 2e.

1336
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:58,700
I didn't have my own computer until, you know, at least a regular use computer until like 95. And I

1337
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:05,660
was on AOL 1.5 on DOS. I have to read this in chat real quick. Rob D's commenting on what I said

1338
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:10,060
there. I'm almost 23, but I played all this stuff when I was younger. And then he links a screenshot

1339
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:14,620
from ZZT. So I just wanted to take a moment to say hail ZZT, one of the greatest PC games of all

1340
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:23,820
fricking time. We miss you. But, um, I do have to make a mention of it that Doom is actually one of

1341
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:31,260
the games that led up to, uh, one of my favorite wads and it wasn't, um, it actually wasn't Doom,

1342
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:35,260
but it was a Quake one. But I first played a version of it on Doom and then found a much

1343
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:43,500
better one for Quake was, um, Gotcha Quake, which was a full on fully redone Gotcha Mon Quake.

1344
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:52,140
But yeah, Doom, Doom was like my thing. So, um, yeah, for anyone who hasn't played it,

1345
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:56,860
God, what planet have you been living on? Bochi Kawa in our chat room says, uh, Doom is seriously

1346
01:08:56,860 --> 01:09:01,420
one of the best games to have lasted for this long. Wow. Um, and you know, and like I was saying,

1347
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:05,180
I didn't even have a crappy movie. If you are one of those like younger folks that didn't get to

1348
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:11,740
experience this, you know, when you were a teen or whatever, um, seriously, like go on Xbox live

1349
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:15,180
and check it out, you know, at least download the demo so you know what we're talking about. I mean,

1350
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:20,460
Xbox live, it's not the same, but it's not bad. I mean, they did a decent job. All right. How is

1351
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:24,140
this though that I still remembered at least what three of the codes were and I haven't played this

1352
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:31,660
game in easily 12 years. I wonder if I hook a USB keyboard in the 360, can I play Doom with a

1353
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:37,660
keyboard like I used to? I haven't thought about that. Maybe a chatter knows. Okay. And I have a

1354
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:43,340
challenge then I have a challenge then, you know, let's go ahead and revive the Doom wad. Doom wad,

1355
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:48,620
that's great. I want someone to make OLR Doom. Good luck. Those things take a lot of work. I

1356
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:53,740
want to see someone. Someone made us a text-based game. That's true. We can have an OLR Doom.

1357
01:09:53,740 --> 01:10:00,940
I want OLR Doom. The text game was pretty awesome. OLR Doom. Do it. I don't know if I want to see my

1358
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:04,940
face melting and getting shot. No, no, we don't use our faces. Well, we need to be the ones with

1359
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:10,540
the gun. We need to be the ones with the gun and whoever wins gets a hat homemade by me. Yes. And

1360
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:15,180
you guys know who the various enemies of OLR are. You can, you can put them in there. Like Ken

1361
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:23,740
Kuragi will be in there with a bicycle helmet and crayons. Uh, some folks in chat saying, oh, Zen

1362
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:30,060
Thrall Zen. There it is. No, Rob. I've tried. I was hoping for the same thing. Fail. So sadly,

1363
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:34,780
you cannot do the keyboard. All right. So that's going to do it for the classic game of the week,

1364
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:40,140
but that was a darn good one. Good job. Yeah. All right. So I know I'm awesome. We're going to take

1365
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:44,300
a quick break here at OLR headquarters, but, uh, don't go anywhere. We'll be right back with part

1366
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:50,380
B, a lot of quick news tonight in part B, as well as some news about another, uh, video game movie,

1367
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:55,580
Sonic 4, more details, blur, a racing game I'm looking forward to, and a few more details on

1368
01:10:55,580 --> 01:11:00,140
Game Room. And are we looking at Wii's being, uh, hard to find all over again? We're going to talk

1369
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:05,260
about that in part B. So don't go anywhere. We will be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1370
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:15,500
And welcome back everybody to more of Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday night, February

1371
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:22,940
the 14th of 2009. It's time for part B of our episode number 355. Uh, during the break there,

1372
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:27,180
we were playing some classic 8-bit songs and unfortunately you don't hear our break music

1373
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:31,740
on the podcast cause you know, copyright issues and all that. But, um, we were playing some 8-bit

1374
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:35,740
songs for our, uh, chatters and they were kind of guessing and we had some, uh, let me, let me just

1375
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:39,100
quickly name you the playlist we had. Cause you know, they're only about a minute long. The NES

1376
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:43,340
songs were, weren't that long. So we did a lot of them. We did a Battle of Olympus, Dr. Mario,

1377
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:48,540
Guardian Legend, Fashanadu, uh, Kid Icarus, Crystalis, Goonies 2, Balloon Fight. And then

1378
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:53,580
what I thought was a really tricky one, Magic of Scheherazade, the town music. That was a

1379
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:58,780
old school NES game I really liked. It was kind of like Zelda and an RPG like mixed together. It was

1380
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:02,700
weird. And then of course Metroid. We had some requests in chat. Like I think some folks want

1381
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:06,700
to hear Star Tropics and I saw a shout out for DuckTales too. Uh, we'll try to get those at the

1382
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:11,340
end for our live listeners. Unfortunately, you guys who are listening to us in the podcast,

1383
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:16,540
we for copyright reasons, can't do that. Although what I can do, I can, I can play the music and

1384
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:21,180
then talk over it. So that's, this is the Magic of Scheherazade music. And then I want to play

1385
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:25,980
like a little clip there. So, anyhow, there you go. Uh, anyone remember that game? Anyone?

1386
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:31,420
Anyone remember playing it? All right. That's not even on virtual console. I think the developer who

1387
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:35,740
made that game probably doesn't exist anymore. I can't remember who made that. Was that the Culture

1388
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:41,660
Brain? I can't even remember. All right. Anyhow, um, let's get into some rapid fire news tonight.

1389
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:47,020
And then now we're going to get into Twitter topics as well. Uh, Mailbag coming up in this

1390
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:53,820
segment as well. Loki, start us off. Do you like free stuff? Because everybody does. I don't know.

1391
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:59,980
I like free stuff. And, uh, one of the things that you can look forward to free is, um, the old

1392
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:05,660
Command and Conquer games. That's right. EA is now offering Command and Conquer classics,

1393
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:13,580
which are free to download. And, um, they are, um, including Tiberium Dawn, Tiberium Sun with

1394
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:21,740
the Firestorm expansion pack and my personal favorite, Red Alert. And of course, um, I guess

1395
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:27,100
apparently they are easy to download, but to get them running with your modern computers,

1396
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:33,260
it may be a little bit tricky. So, uh, keep that in mind. But if you're looking to download those,

1397
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:40,380
um, apparently, uh, Big Download is the website that, uh, will have those available.

1398
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:48,460
bigdownload.com. Um, some other cool stuff. Of course, the Lego Star Wars games, um, very popular.

1399
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:52,700
And you may be thinking, hey, what's gonna happen? And what are they gonna do for the third one?

1400
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:59,180
Since obviously they've ran out of the, um, Star Wars movies. Well, not exactly. Because the third

1401
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:05,420
Lego Star Wars game will actually follow the Clone Wars. Um, I'm assuming the movie and maybe the TV

1402
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:10,220
series. It's scheduled to come out later this year, probably in the fall, just in time for

1403
01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:15,580
holidays and on all your favorite platforms, except for the PlayStation 2. And, uh, they're

1404
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:22,140
seeing some brand new battle modes. Um, also some head-to-head combat as well. Uh, the level editor

1405
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:30,140
from Indiana Jones, um, 2 will be coming back as well. And, um, just some new, uh, squad commands.

1406
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:36,860
Uh, lightsaber slicing, lightsaber jumps, long-distance Jedi attacks, and grapple tie-ups,

1407
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:43,980
and whatnot. So that's kind of cool. Even though I'm not really a fan of the Clone Wars series.

1408
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:52,860
Oh well. Um, and then finally, um, L.A. Noire, a game that is coming from Rockstar, will be making

1409
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:59,740
its way out this year in September. It is, of course, a kind of a crime drama game, um, brought

1410
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:07,260
to you by the folks that put out Grand Theft Auto. And, uh, what once was a PlayStation 3 exclusive

1411
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:14,860
is now, of course, coming out on both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. So, that is it.

1412
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:18,620
All right. I've got a lot of news about the iPhone tonight. Like, all my stories are about the iPhone.

1413
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:21,580
I don't know what's up with that, but I guess maybe because, you know what, when it comes to

1414
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:26,220
handheld gaming, it's the biggest competitor with the DS and PSP. Real quick, real quick one.

1415
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:31,340
All right. One thing we were talking about last week, you know, speaking of, um, Xbox 360 and

1416
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:38,700
PlayStation 3 exclusives. Okay. Um, we were up in the air about, um, the Xbox 360 getting a version

1417
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:43,180
of Final Fantasy XIV. I can confirm that is actually going to happen. Now, how do you know

1418
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:47,420
this for sure? Because this is, this is somewhat of a bombshell to be dropping and part B of our

1419
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:53,100
show, which a lot of people probably don't listen long enough to get to. Um, just listening from

1420
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:57,820
Square. So, I'm sure they'll announce it soon at some point. You know, I don't even know when the

1421
01:15:57,820 --> 01:16:02,460
game's coming out right now. It's still scheduled around. Do you think, or do you have anything that

1422
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:07,180
indicates to you that it's going to be simultaneous with PS3 or it should be the same later. It should

1423
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:12,940
be the same time, but right now it's all kind of, you know, we don't even know exactly, you know,

1424
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:18,300
for sure that it, you know, when it's coming out right now, it's like kind of hovering around June,

1425
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:22,540
but that's up to get sleep all the time. That was a nice little bombshell to tuck there in a rapid

1426
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:28,620
fire news. No, it's cool. Talking about exclusives. So, I mean, I don't know. It makes sense because

1427
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:35,260
they're going to sell a hell lot of Final Fantasy 13 on 360. So I'm not surprised. All right. Well,

1428
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:40,060
gee, it makes my iPhone stories look a little silly, but I'll try. Uh, well actually the Amiga

1429
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:44,140
was awesome. And for those that remember the Commodore Amiga, it was, it was a very graphically

1430
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:47,900
awesome system at the time. And if you want to play some of Amiga games on the iPhone,

1431
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:52,700
you may soon have the chance. Uh, Manomio, who did the Commodore 64 emulator, remember how it

1432
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:56,620
was like on the store, then not on the store and so forth. Uh, apparently they, he has gotten,

1433
01:16:56,620 --> 01:17:01,180
or the people, I don't know if it's just one guy or several, they've gotten an Amiga emulator to

1434
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:07,180
work and they're going to release Amiga games as standalone apps. Um, apparently international

1435
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:12,460
karate plus is one of the, uh, games slated for release. Looks a lot like Yer Kung Fu.

1436
01:17:12,460 --> 01:17:18,460
Um, Apogee's Rise of the Triad is going to be coming to the iPhone. You remember Rise of

1437
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:21,740
the Triad? If I remember right, it was kind of like the Wolfenstein 3D, but kind of reskinned

1438
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:26,460
and redone with the maps and so forth that is coming to the iPhone as well. There were some

1439
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:32,460
earlier rumors, but it is coming to the app store in early 2010. There's actually a video on YouTube

1440
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:38,540
if you want to look it up. And, uh, also big bombshell on the, uh, iPhone plants versus zombies

1441
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:43,500
because pop, pop crack, you know, they put out a lot of addicting games. Plants versus zombies has

1442
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:47,820
a date, which seems strange because Apple games don't usually get dated because it's just kind of,

1443
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:52,300
you're at Apple's mercy. But for whatever reason, PopCap has said it is coming out on the handheld

1444
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:58,300
February 15th. That would be tomorrow. Or if you're listening on the podcast, probably today

1445
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:04,060
or yesterday. So, uh, plants versus zombies on February 15th on the iPhone. There you go,

1446
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:08,940
DarkSakura. Well, there, um, I'm just going to have to do this as it's in front of me. Um,

1447
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:15,340
someone at Kotaku received a package. That's a blue boxing glove holding a rose. Indicative of

1448
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:21,740
a rumor. Ah, that perhaps Dudley will be in Street Fighter 4, or Super Street Fighter 4, I should

1449
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:28,140
say. So that would be pretty cool. Even though I never used him and thought he sucked. Although

1450
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:35,740
people are infuriating using him. Um, Mega Man 10, um, will have, um, a March release. Um,

1451
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:44,700
the, uh, we will have it after, um, sorry, the WiiWare version will be March 1st. PlayStation

1452
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:53,020
3 will be March 11th and Xbox 360 will be March 31st. And then, um, in that batch, um,

1453
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:58,220
Rock Band is going to be getting, um, some new tracks. Um, an Otis Redding track pack, which is,

1454
01:18:58,220 --> 01:19:03,260
uh, Sitting on the Dock of the Bay. Um, the Fa, Fa, Fa, Fa, Fa Sad Song. I'm Sick Y'all,

1455
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:08,780
I Got Dreams to Remember, and Love Man. And then some individual, um, tracks, All Time Low,

1456
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:13,740
Weightless, Alpha Beat Fascination, Briar Sets of Orchestra, Stray Cat Strut. That's such a cool

1457
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:18,860
song. And the Chemical Brothers, Let Forever Be. And they're also available for Lego Rock Band.

1458
01:19:18,860 --> 01:19:25,100
Okay. How about some Twitter topics then, if we're all done with, uh, the rapid fire stuff

1459
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:30,700
tonight, let's get into some Twitter topics. Although our computer is acting up right now

1460
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:37,260
and I can't even access the theme music because it's being rude. And I don't know if our feed

1461
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:45,580
just went down. We did go down. Are we down? We're down. All right. Hold on guys. Uh, those of you

1462
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:49,340
listening on the podcast, we need to go ahead and just, uh, bring our feed right back up.

1463
01:19:56,060 --> 01:20:00,220
Okay. We're back. We had a little bit of a live stream difficulty there. So we lost all of our

1464
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:04,780
listeners there for a minute. I don't know why, but Winamp decided to crash on us. And it's kind

1465
01:20:04,780 --> 01:20:08,380
of an important program when we're trying to broadcast because we use Shoutcast to send our

1466
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:12,860
feed over to the all game servers. So when we left off with the show, uh, Jamie had, uh, just

1467
01:20:12,860 --> 01:20:18,380
finished up her last, uh, little, uh, rapid fire stories talking about the rock band releases for

1468
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:21,820
the week. I'm not sure if our live listeners got to hear that, uh, but we know it's saved

1469
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:25,900
for the podcast. So we're going to move on now and move into some Twitter topics.

1470
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:35,340
Of course, every week we invite your tweets at twitter.com slash O L R we got a lot tonight.

1471
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:39,500
So I apologize if I don't get to your tweet, but we just have kind of a lot tonight. So

1472
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:43,340
especially if you spent, sent multiple tweets, probably only going to read one. Okay. Uh,

1473
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:49,180
tiger cloth three Oh five sends us a tweet that says game teaches. I don't even know if I should

1474
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:57,260
say this with a child in the room. Game teaches S E X through the eyes of a superhero. Of course,

1475
01:20:57,260 --> 01:21:04,220
Jillian would walk into the room, right? As I'm, uh, starting to, uh, read this story here.

1476
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:09,740
Awkward. All right. So I game teaches S E X through the eyes of a superhero. Apparently,

1477
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:16,380
uh, health officials, uh, in, uh, Ontario, Canada, uh, talking about a new video game

1478
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:21,020
launched Thursday that will help teenagers learn about sex through the eyes of a superhero. He

1479
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:26,220
left the room. It's okay. Uh, this is an online game, ironically by the Middlesex London health

1480
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:30,540
unit. Uh, it gets a player to choose a character and answer true or false questions about their

1481
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:39,180
activity. You can either be a man named captain condoms, a Virgin named wonder badge, uh, a boy

1482
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:46,220
named Willie, the kid who believes size doesn't matter or power pap, a sexually active gal. This

1483
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:51,180
is worth it just for the names alone. Uh, you have to fight the game super villain, the Sperminator,

1484
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:55,580
who is a muscular man wearing a red wrestling mask with of course, penis arms by correctly

1485
01:21:55,580 --> 01:21:59,580
answering a number of questions. If you get an answer wrong, you get shot by sperm. What

1486
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:07,580
the hell kind of game is this? The tiger called link to us. This is disgusting. It's www dot get

1487
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:13,500
it on london.com and uh, it's supposed to be, you know, about health clinics and using

1488
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:17,900
contraceptives and all this stuff. And believe it or not, it's being promoted at some public

1489
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:22,620
schools from the region. Now that whole thing came from Montreal gazette.com so it is being

1490
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:28,460
used in some places. That was a fascinating little Twitter story. There you go. Um,

1491
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:35,260
let's see from dark Tetsuya on Twitter. The guys that released the police knots, English patch are

1492
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:41,020
working on their next project, dead of the brain, a one and two, and that was on the PC engine. So

1493
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:43,900
I don't know if those are games that dark soccer is familiar with, but those are the games they're

1494
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:49,340
going to translate next. Dead of the brain one and two on PC engine. Their adventure games was

1495
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:55,020
zombies. Sounds like fun. Uh, SGA 100. Matt linked us to this. I don't know if any of you guys saw

1496
01:22:55,020 --> 01:23:00,780
that new, we are the world video for the 25th anniversary or whatever refuse. It was, it was

1497
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:06,060
awful. It is awful. Like Michael Jackson, like seriously, if I were him, I would rise from the

1498
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:12,060
grave and like slap, um, who's that guy, little Wayne or whatever in the face for using auto

1499
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:17,340
tune in a disgusting way on that song. Um, there was auto tune on that song. It was bad.

1500
01:23:18,140 --> 01:23:22,780
It is. And just, it is bad. He couldn't so bad. Well, we just know he can't say it was so bad.

1501
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:27,340
Like seriously, like I'm all for, you know, you supporting charities and all that, but don't do

1502
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:32,060
it through this organization. Like just, just donate to the red cross or donate to one of the

1503
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:35,820
Haiti relief organizations. Don't make these celebrities think they actually helped cause

1504
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:41,340
they didn't. That's, that's my take on it. I'm sorry. I actually did buy the, um, the Haiti

1505
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:46,300
help Haiti, whatever. Yeah. I did the little text message too. And they did a telethon and so forth.

1506
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:53,820
I downloaded the album on Amazon. Oh, okay. And Shakira is not allowed to cover the pretenders

1507
01:23:53,820 --> 01:24:00,780
ever. Never. Anyhow, SSA 100 Matt didn't want us to just talk about that. They wanted us to

1508
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:04,140
mention that somebody in the video and you can't really see who because it's obscured,

1509
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:07,180
but it's circled here. Well, this is actually cause they're showing clips of, I believe this

1510
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:10,860
is Haiti at this point. You actually can see somebody's wearing a fatal fury hat.

1511
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:17,740
Just kind of an LOL video game reference there in the video. So it's just kind of funny. Um,

1512
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:24,060
let's see, uh, going to some other tweets here. Um, act deft linked us to a tweet.

1513
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:31,500
It was a retweet from rock band aid. The Viacom CEO has said rock band DLC will be more selective

1514
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:37,820
in the future. Hmm. So apparently they're going to start to scale back maybe some of the stuff that,

1515
01:24:37,820 --> 01:24:43,420
you know, cause they put a lot of stuff on there. Um, maybe they're just finally realizing they're

1516
01:24:43,420 --> 01:24:47,100
not selling as much as they used to and that there's a lot of tracks that maybe just aren't

1517
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:51,100
worthy of being on rock band. Maybe because they have the rock band network. Now they

1518
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:56,860
can kind of screen through a lot of stuff. I don't know. Let's see. A master of the claw linked us

1519
01:24:56,860 --> 01:25:01,420
to a YouTube, but I can't pull it up in studio cause it'll be too quick here, but it says this

1520
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:06,300
relates to typing at the dead. Apparently there was a PC guitar battling game from 1995, but it

1521
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:15,500
is a short clip. Uh, and then lastly here from spazzinator PSN, which is better local or online

1522
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:23,020
multiplayer? I say online for one reason, the no pants rule, LOL. So I don't know. I'm Loki. What

1523
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:28,940
do you think is local or online gaming better? I would prefer local, um, gaming, you know, like,

1524
01:25:28,940 --> 01:25:33,740
um, some of the system link stuff I cause, you know, especially it's not dependent on having

1525
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:40,060
X-Box live working cause that our work, man, we've got some serious issues with, um, you know,

1526
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:45,500
lag and stuff cause we're sharing a network with, and we found out why our network is so laggy.

1527
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:51,020
It's because we have these wonderful, um, or I should say it's, it was a wonderful use of company

1528
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:57,580
money. Um, we have these photo frames on all of our desks that pull pictures off of a website

1529
01:25:57,580 --> 01:26:04,220
that have, you know, little event pictures from our work and stuff and the web shots. Yes. And

1530
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:11,660
they all suck bandwidth. And so we have like X-Box life disconnects all the freaking time.

1531
01:26:11,660 --> 01:26:17,580
Just from those stupid things. Thankfully they're fixing it, but still, um, you know, that's why I

1532
01:26:17,580 --> 01:26:21,100
do like system link for that kind of stuff. And I kind of wish Grant that thought I had system

1533
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:26,060
link cause if that was the case, we'd be still playing our modded games. I prefer local

1534
01:26:26,060 --> 01:26:31,100
multiplayer, but I really like online multiplayer when local multiplayer is impossible. Yeah. For

1535
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:34,380
example, I think I've said this on the show before, my boyfriend lives two hours away.

1536
01:26:34,380 --> 01:26:39,180
So, you know, during the week we can't really just drive out and see each other one night. So,

1537
01:26:39,180 --> 01:26:43,740
you know, on the weekends we'll play like castle crashers or something together. But during the

1538
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:49,900
week we play, wow, you know, online. So, uh, I don't, I like online gaming for when in real life

1539
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:56,060
isn't possible. Um, there you go. That was the last question for tonight. More Twitter topics

1540
01:26:56,060 --> 01:27:02,140
next week at twitter.com slash O L R. Uh, let's get back into some more news stories. We'll start

1541
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:07,100
off with Loki. Yes. Um, Oh, I'm sorry. Can I throw this out here real quick? I'm sorry. Act F wanted

1542
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:12,700
to append his tweet saying that the rock band article goes on to talk about how the fees that

1543
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:17,340
the record labels are charging for the music being on rock band is probably leading to them being

1544
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:21,900
more selective, which if the record companies are going to get greedy with what ends up being

1545
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:27,820
promotion for their own stuff, I say, let him get what's coming to him. And that is rock band

1546
01:27:27,820 --> 01:27:35,020
turning them down. Hmm. Okay. Sorry. Loki. That's all right. Um, so it's hard to believe that even

1547
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:43,580
though the Wii's been out for almost three years now that, um, there's still shortages apparently.

1548
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:49,260
And, um, some of the retailers are saying that the demand is still outpacing the supply

1549
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:55,340
and a bunch of different retailers, including GameStop, uh, Amazon and Newegg have all been

1550
01:27:55,340 --> 01:28:01,900
having issues, uh, keeping the wheat in stock. And apparently, um, orders from Nintendo are just not

1551
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:08,220
coming in in a timely manner. And Nintendo is saying, well, the, uh, replenishing the

1552
01:28:08,220 --> 01:28:14,940
Wii supply can, will be a challenge. And apparently in short term, replenishing the Wii

1553
01:28:14,940 --> 01:28:20,700
inventories will be a challenge, but we're doing everything we can to satisfy customers, um, or

1554
01:28:20,700 --> 01:28:30,380
consumers looking for a Wii to purchase. And, um, apparently, I guess, uh, December, it was thought

1555
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:36,140
that Nintendo had actually reduced Wii production going into the, or, um, had actually reduced Wii

1556
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:43,660
production going into the holiday is, uh, from a report in December. But you see, here's the problem

1557
01:28:43,660 --> 01:28:49,980
I have with this is that they always say, oh, we're having trouble, you know, making the Wii's and

1558
01:28:49,980 --> 01:28:56,380
stuff like that. Come on. You know, I'm not believing, I don't buy it. I'm not believing that any of those

1559
01:28:56,380 --> 01:29:00,860
shortages from before or even like, I think they were all manufactured. And I mean, come on, this

1560
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:06,540
shortage now you can't put out a console. You know, why aren't you putting out tons and tons and tons

1561
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:10,860
of consoles out there in the market? I mean, are you afraid that people are just going to find

1562
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:15,420
everywhere and then now they're not going to want them? I mean, I don't understand if your console

1563
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:20,460
is that good, then what's the problem of having a good supply of them? Oh, I know because you need

1564
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:25,020
to create this artificial shortage so everyone scrambles for them. Something's up too. And I'm

1565
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:29,180
calling them on it. It's, it's, this is stupid that it's like three years out and they're still

1566
01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:34,780
having these bad shortages. You know what? Then don't buy a Wii. If you can't find a Wii, maybe

1567
01:29:34,780 --> 01:29:38,780
you shouldn't buy one. Go out and get a 360 or a PS3. They're both much more reasonable than they

1568
01:29:38,780 --> 01:29:47,420
were before. Yeah. So. Anyhow. Well, something you shouldn't do though with these shortages,

1569
01:29:47,420 --> 01:29:53,100
you probably shouldn't pirate your games or you might get caught. So this is at least what one

1570
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:58,380
Australian pirate wants you to know. Apparently he had pirated New Super Mario Brothers on the Wii

1571
01:29:58,380 --> 01:30:05,340
and I guess put it up for download. And let's see, his name was James Burt and he was 24 years old.

1572
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:10,940
He illegally uploaded New Super Mario Brothers Wii to the internet and thanks to a current affair in

1573
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:16,140
Australia, I guess, profiled him. He did this whole little interview there and they asked him,

1574
01:30:16,140 --> 01:30:21,740
did you admit that what you did was quite stupid? Apparently Nintendo Australia is claiming that the

1575
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:28,620
upload of New Super Mario Brothers Wii was snatched 50,000 times. He got a copy from somebody

1576
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:35,100
who broke the street date on the game and basically saying the folks at Nintendo, it's no different

1577
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:42,380
than stealing anything else. Now let's see, James Burt will have to pay a 1.5 million dollar fine in

1578
01:30:42,380 --> 01:30:48,460
Australian dollars. It's about 1.3 million US. That was a settlement by the way too. Wow. He says

1579
01:30:48,460 --> 01:30:51,900
it's something he's going to have to work through for the rest of my life. That was a quote there.

1580
01:30:52,540 --> 01:30:58,140
Well that's what you get for uploading stuff to the internet. Downloading? They never seem to go

1581
01:30:58,140 --> 01:31:01,980
after those people but uploaders, man, those are the guys that they go after. You know what,

1582
01:31:01,980 --> 01:31:05,580
I wouldn't want to be the one that gets caught. So remember what they say, don't copy that floppy.

1583
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:11,420
Don't worry, I'm not copying the floppies. Just, you know what, be careful.

1584
01:31:11,420 --> 01:31:17,820
You do, but you do admit when you copy games like that you are breaking the law. You are copying

1585
01:31:17,820 --> 01:31:23,100
something that's, you know, not supposed to be copied. There's really no nice way of putting it.

1586
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:27,500
But you're not, I mean. Is it a Robin Hood steal for the rich, give to the poor thing? I don't know,

1587
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:32,540
that's an ethical question but it is stealing. Not really, not by the definition of stealing.

1588
01:31:32,540 --> 01:31:38,140
Stealing means, okay, possession is moved from one object to another. If, like for example, if

1589
01:31:38,140 --> 01:31:44,460
you have a car stereo in your car and I somehow managed to duplicate that car stereo, you still

1590
01:31:44,460 --> 01:31:51,100
have your car stereo. But now I have your car stereo. I just hear all these stories about game

1591
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:55,580
developers having to shut down and people losing their jobs and stuff and I don't, I don't think

1592
01:31:55,580 --> 01:32:00,380
piracy is as huge, especially on the consoles, maybe on PCs, but on the consoles some people

1593
01:32:00,380 --> 01:32:04,780
make it out to be because I think you have to kind of really know what you're doing in order

1594
01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:10,140
to do that. I mean, maybe I'm just being naive, that's fine, but I do feel sorry for a lot of

1595
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:16,540
these folks because of piracy. I do feel bad for Nintendo and this is why that they're unable to

1596
01:32:16,540 --> 01:32:21,740
put out those Nintendo systems. If only they had sold 50,000 copies more of New Super Mario

1597
01:32:21,740 --> 01:32:27,420
Brothers Wii in Australia, the world would be a better place. Wiis would be plentiful, everyone

1598
01:32:27,420 --> 01:32:31,820
would be happy. I think a lot of times though, I bet of those 50,000 people, they wouldn't have

1599
01:32:31,820 --> 01:32:38,060
bought the game. I mean, that's the one thing I will say, maybe of the 50,000, like 500 ever

1600
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:43,820
actually planned on buying the game. A lot of people want to download stuff because it's free.

1601
01:32:43,820 --> 01:32:49,420
There's lots of people that download CDs that are like, oh, I don't know if I had ever really

1602
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:53,820
listened to this, but hey, since I have an opportunity, I'll check this out. I actually buy

1603
01:32:53,820 --> 01:33:02,780
CDs and individual tracks off Amazon all the time. I buy iTunes and regular CDs once in a while too,

1604
01:33:02,780 --> 01:33:07,660
but what I cannot stand is like import. Like very recently, I'll admit I downloaded a CD,

1605
01:33:07,660 --> 01:33:11,340
but that's because the CD is not out here, but it's out in another country. I'll support the

1606
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:14,940
artists when they're finally released here, but in the meantime. If it's what I'm thinking of,

1607
01:33:14,940 --> 01:33:20,060
I'm totally planning on getting that. Yes, it is what you're thinking. And by the way,

1608
01:33:20,060 --> 01:33:25,340
I actually almost laid down 30 bucks to import an Angela Aki CD. So I was close.

1609
01:33:25,340 --> 01:33:29,260
Okay. Let me put it this way. I think people need to realize it's a worldwide market now.

1610
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:35,740
I understand. I understand that, you know, it is technically theft, but it's one of those,

1611
01:33:35,740 --> 01:33:39,660
I guess you would say it's like a, not really a harmless crime, but it's,

1612
01:33:41,660 --> 01:33:46,060
you know, victimless, I guess. I don't know. But you would see, I guess you could say that

1613
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:50,380
development houses are victims. And I was gonna say how many development houses did Activision

1614
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:55,340
shut down? Oh, okay. Come on. That is not because of piracy. That is because they're stupid and put

1615
01:33:55,340 --> 01:34:01,660
out 50,000 different guitar hero games. Oh, boo fucking who? Okay. You know, those guys got paid

1616
01:34:01,660 --> 01:34:05,420
for making the games that they did. And you know what? The one development house put out the really

1617
01:34:05,420 --> 01:34:11,580
shitty, you know, Transformers games. So I don't feel bad for them at all. You know, Luxo Flux.

1618
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:15,740
Hey, you made a great game when Vigilante 8 came out, but what the fuck happened since then?

1619
01:34:15,740 --> 01:34:21,180
Nothing. You put out crappy games now. But anyways, whatever. Okay. So that's, that's

1620
01:34:21,180 --> 01:34:25,500
their decision. They'll get eaten up by some other, you know, publishing house or something

1621
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:31,100
like that. So they're going to be in work again eventually. But that is not because of piracy.

1622
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:36,220
Piracy did not cause guitar hero Van Halen to sell like shit. The game was just shit. That's,

1623
01:34:36,220 --> 01:34:41,980
that's all that it comes down to. I don't think you can, maybe I'm just being naive, but I, I,

1624
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:46,620
I don't pirate, pirate console games because, well, A, I just, you know, I'd rather have the

1625
01:34:46,620 --> 01:34:53,740
real thing. And B, it's kind of a pain in the ass to do. It's, it's, it's actually easier for

1626
01:34:53,740 --> 01:34:58,540
me to use something legitimate like Gamefly. I could if I wanted to, but I have too many

1627
01:34:58,540 --> 01:35:05,260
games I'm playing now. So why would I bother downloading and burning off a game to just sit?

1628
01:35:06,540 --> 01:35:10,860
Ooh, good. Look, I have a whole stack of like, you know, games I could be playing,

1629
01:35:10,860 --> 01:35:15,900
but I don't have time because I'm playing Borderlands or I'm playing Bioshock 2 or,

1630
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:19,580
you know, it's just, I don't have time for that stuff.

1631
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:23,260
All right. The views and opinions expressed by the host do not necessarily. All right. Anyway,

1632
01:35:23,260 --> 01:35:27,900
but if you want to express your opinion, uh, we'll take emails, mailbag at orangeontraded.com.

1633
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:33,260
I'm sure some people are sitting there wanting to say their piece. So, uh, I'm sure we'll hear more

1634
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:37,820
about this next week. Uh, moving on, I'm going to go ahead and cover this next story as well.

1635
01:35:37,820 --> 01:35:44,860
It has to do with, uh, the iPad and, uh, PopCap. Apparently PopCap, or as I've called them before

1636
01:35:44,860 --> 01:35:50,860
in the show, PopCrack, they do believe that the iPad will change gaming. It's just going to take

1637
01:35:50,860 --> 01:35:54,460
about three years and a hardware update before it's really going to happen. This comes from the

1638
01:35:54,460 --> 01:36:00,140
co-founder of PopCap, John Vesce, uh, talking to Eurogamer saying that the, uh, iPad will change

1639
01:36:00,140 --> 01:36:04,300
gaming. It will be phenomenally successful and it will fulfill a need consumers don't even know they

1640
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:08,620
have yet. The iPad's important, but I think it's going to be more important in three years.

1641
01:36:08,620 --> 01:36:12,300
Look how long it took the iPod to get the momentum where everyone has one. It's probably going to

1642
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:17,100
take the second generation iPad to make it really like, wow. This is my opinion and I think it's

1643
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:21,020
going to be phenomenally successful. I really do. It's very simple. It's not like it has a magical

1644
01:36:21,020 --> 01:36:25,660
set of features, just a great package. I know what I'm getting when I have to get my mom a computer

1645
01:36:25,660 --> 01:36:29,420
now on iPad because she can't screw it up. She can't download a bunch of stuff. That's the

1646
01:36:29,420 --> 01:36:32,940
perfect mom computer, right? And it's the perfect computer for 10 year olds to play with. Again,

1647
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:38,380
those comments from PopCap co-founder John Vesce to Eurogamer. Wrong. Okay. You know why I'm

1648
01:36:38,380 --> 01:36:42,460
singing wrong? I mean, it's the perfect, perfect computer. She can't download anything to it and

1649
01:36:42,460 --> 01:36:47,500
stuff. Okay. So what you're seeing is your mom's an idiot and can't, you know, handle, you know,

1650
01:36:48,620 --> 01:36:55,900
Oh, what's this attachment virus? That sounds interesting. Well, my, my mom who for the longest

1651
01:36:55,900 --> 01:37:01,180
time didn't even know what the CD tray did in a computer is now using email and I get emails from

1652
01:37:01,180 --> 01:37:05,260
her and it's very strange, but I'm just worried. My grandmother's using email. I'm worried the next

1653
01:37:05,260 --> 01:37:08,940
time I go, she's going to be like, Rob, I need you to help me with my computer. I want to learn how

1654
01:37:08,940 --> 01:37:13,820
to use Facebook. At which point I'm just going to kill myself. My mother's on Facebook. But, um,

1655
01:37:15,020 --> 01:37:18,460
whenever I get asked, I know I'm going to go to her house and I'm just like, her, her thing will

1656
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:22,300
be riddled with popups and she'll somehow have Gator on her computer, even though they went

1657
01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:27,020
bankrupt like 10 years ago. Like it'll just be flooded with spyware and virus ware and all this

1658
01:37:27,020 --> 01:37:33,260
stuff. Well, there's, I mean, just use common sense, but I mean, okay, let's say, Oh, this is

1659
01:37:33,260 --> 01:37:37,500
the computer I'm going to get my mom or something like that. I'm sorry. Would you really want to get

1660
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:43,020
her something that's way overpriced? You can get her a nice laptop for the same kind of money as

1661
01:37:43,020 --> 01:37:47,100
that. And you know what? A little bit of common sense goes a long way. Don't need the, you know,

1662
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:52,220
buy them. You know, the Apple products are not, you know, computers for complete idiots. They

1663
01:37:52,220 --> 01:37:56,700
can't understand anything. I mean, at least that's, I hope not the impression that they're

1664
01:37:56,700 --> 01:38:01,980
trying to put out there. Oh, I'm sorry. You're too dumb for PC. You need to move to app to, uh,

1665
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:08,060
the Apple products, you know, Apple products. It's special ed for computer users. Look,

1666
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:12,380
despite the choice of words he used, I think he makes a point. It's kind of the same thing I said

1667
01:38:12,380 --> 01:38:17,100
about the iPad a couple of weeks ago. There's going to be a new one. Apple puts out new ones

1668
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:21,580
every year. And this first version of the iPad is kind of yoink yoink, but let's not forget the

1669
01:38:21,580 --> 01:38:26,700
iPhone didn't have the apps on it when it first came out. And that's what really took the iPhone

1670
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:32,860
to the next level. The iPad will get its features. It's just going to take a year. I tell you,

1671
01:38:32,860 --> 01:38:36,940
if an iPad like had a video camera on the front of it, then so you could do video conferencing

1672
01:38:36,940 --> 01:38:41,180
from it, like over 3g and stuff. Oh my God, it would sell like crazy. And that'll be in the

1673
01:38:41,180 --> 01:38:46,940
revision. It will wait and see, and then it'll change gaming. Cause it'll have a camera. It'll

1674
01:38:46,940 --> 01:38:50,940
have motion, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You know what though? The Nintendo we three will be

1675
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:55,740
super awesome because it's going to have, you know, holographic graphics and it's just going to be

1676
01:38:55,740 --> 01:38:59,820
phenomenal. So let's just, you know, support them with that. Oh yeah. With a PlayStation

1677
01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:04,060
four is going to vacuum the floor and do the dishes and cook me breakfast.

1678
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:11,420
I mean, that's stupid. That's a stupid argument. Oh, well it's not going to, it'll be good in three

1679
01:39:11,420 --> 01:39:18,300
years. Well, good for them. It'll be good after they figured out it sucks. That's awesome. That's

1680
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:23,340
an awesome argument. Yeah, it sucks now, but you know, eventually when they figure out that it

1681
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:29,340
sucks and make a better platform, then it'll be awesome. No, it won't. It'll still suck and then

1682
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:33,980
they'll come out with something else. One step closer to the holodeck. Gaming always takes us

1683
01:39:33,980 --> 01:39:40,780
one step closer to the holodeck. Such a stupid argument. I'm sorry. Stupid pop cap. Make your,

1684
01:39:40,780 --> 01:39:44,540
you make your addicting little games and be done with it and we don't need your opinion out there

1685
01:39:44,540 --> 01:39:49,740
in the marketplace. I'm telling you, Bejeweled Blitz, seriously, crack. Seriously, crack. Okay.

1686
01:39:49,740 --> 01:39:55,740
And I, and I give them props for making addictive casual games that sell like crazy. At the same

1687
01:39:55,740 --> 01:40:00,860
time, they have no fucking clue what platform works well, you know, out there. I mean, come on,

1688
01:40:00,860 --> 01:40:08,700
man. It is just a large, you know, iPod touch. That's all it is. And yeah. Let the man have an

1689
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:13,020
opinion. Whatever. It'll be phenomenal later on when the new version comes out. Well, that's

1690
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:16,620
awesome, but you know, by that time they're going to come out with something else and people are

1691
01:40:16,620 --> 01:40:20,860
going to totally forget about the iPad. Where every gamer has a voice, Loki. Every gamer.

1692
01:40:22,620 --> 01:40:30,860
Whatever. All right, Loki, what do you have for us? Next one news. God, it's so frustrating. Um,

1693
01:40:30,860 --> 01:40:34,940
well, apparently they're making movies about anything nowadays. That's especially the case

1694
01:40:34,940 --> 01:40:39,980
when it comes to licensing movie or games into movies. Um, speaking of which, you know, half

1695
01:40:39,980 --> 01:40:45,820
these games that get licensed into movies, um, it's like, where the hell are they? Like for

1696
01:40:45,820 --> 01:40:51,340
example, clock tower, where the hell is that? I mean, shit, they're making movies based on

1697
01:40:51,340 --> 01:40:55,580
battleship. Wasn't there supposed to be a silent, a silent hill two movie at some point too.

1698
01:40:55,580 --> 01:40:59,660
Oh yeah. I'm sure after, you know, they've, you know, they're done churning out remakes.

1699
01:40:59,660 --> 01:41:04,060
It was supposed to be like a new clue. Like they say, keep saying as a remake of the eighties one,

1700
01:41:04,060 --> 01:41:09,180
but it's not because that is like, that's, that is scripture to me. You do not remake clue from

1701
01:41:09,180 --> 01:41:16,940
the eighties. Okay. Um, but they're gonna do like the battleship and whatever. No, in monopoly. Oh

1702
01:41:16,940 --> 01:41:23,100
yeah. Monopoly movie. You can't, you can't. I'd like to see a Yahtzee movie. Go fish.

1703
01:41:25,660 --> 01:41:31,660
A movie about old maid and it's about an old maid. It's awful. Her pairs of friends. Anyways,

1704
01:41:31,660 --> 01:41:37,980
speaking of awful, um, you know, one of the games that they decided to, or I guess the developer of

1705
01:41:37,980 --> 01:41:42,540
said game is looking to license it into a movie, kind of the opposite of where, you know, uh,

1706
01:41:42,540 --> 01:41:47,660
Darkest of Days. It was a game based off of, you know, you're this, these futuristic soldiers that

1707
01:41:47,660 --> 01:41:52,700
go back in time to save certain people from different wars. So basically it's time cop

1708
01:41:52,700 --> 01:42:00,780
again. Um, you go back in time and you, you know, kill people and whatnot. Um, so now they are,

1709
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:08,780
they're looking at, um, I guess the, um, the writers of the rock are attached to craft the,

1710
01:42:08,780 --> 01:42:12,780
uh, screenplays. So, Hey, that could be kind of cool cause you know, they wrote a pretty good

1711
01:42:12,780 --> 01:42:19,260
screenplay for the rock, but Oh, the good thing about this though, is the premise is interesting

1712
01:42:19,260 --> 01:42:25,740
enough where that most people won't even realize it's a game time. And in fact, it probably,

1713
01:42:25,740 --> 01:42:32,060
it's a good thing that they don't associate it with the game at all. But can they make a movie

1714
01:42:32,060 --> 01:42:35,500
out of this? I mean, do you think it would be any good? It's vague enough to where it works. It's

1715
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:40,940
people going back in time, killing other people. I mean, that sounds interesting enough. All right.

1716
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:46,540
Too bad. The game didn't have more of an impact. Yeah. Uh, moving on to a game that probably will

1717
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:51,020
have more impact. We talked a lot about this last week, uh, Sonic the Hedgehog four, but the news

1718
01:42:51,020 --> 01:42:55,020
had just recently came out when we did the show. So, um, a little more has developed, including

1719
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:59,980
a rumor going around that Sonic the Hedgehog four may actually be out in retail once all of the

1720
01:42:59,980 --> 01:43:04,380
episodes come out on, uh, you know, the various networks, um, sort of like what they did with

1721
01:43:04,380 --> 01:43:08,380
grand theft auto four, you know, they had the download content and then they released a, uh,

1722
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:13,260
released it to retail. Uh, this is a rumor, I guess, from people reading into the Sonic four

1723
01:43:13,260 --> 01:43:18,220
website. Uh, apparently, uh, even though it talks about Sonic four on digital platforms,

1724
01:43:18,220 --> 01:43:23,900
there's still another one that says TBD to be determined for a Sonic four. So who knows

1725
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:28,380
a retail release possibly by the way, speaking of Sonic four, there's a petition going around

1726
01:43:28,380 --> 01:43:33,100
for folks not happy with the look of the new Sonic. That's right. Some folks say that old

1727
01:43:33,100 --> 01:43:37,900
2d Sonic need to come back. There is a petition because there's always some damn petition online

1728
01:43:37,900 --> 01:43:43,420
for something about 500 people have signed it so far wanting Sega to change the Sonic design back

1729
01:43:43,420 --> 01:43:48,620
to the way he looked in the Genesis era. I mean, granted, I could see like maybe a code that

1730
01:43:48,620 --> 01:43:52,700
unlocks the old Sonic sprite, but as far as I'm concerned, if you want to go back and see the old

1731
01:43:52,700 --> 01:44:00,300
Sonic from 15 years ago, go back and play the old Sonic from 15 years ago. Agree? Disagree? Dark

1732
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:05,820
Sakura, what do you think of the petition? Well, it's not a sprite anyway. It's 3d model. So

1733
01:44:07,900 --> 01:44:13,340
whatever you can sort of take a sprite and make a 3d model out of it though. Like I would reference

1734
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:17,500
like the game and watch character in smash brothers, melee. So you could sort of do it

1735
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:24,380
if you really wanted to. Right. I guess it'd be possible. I mean, they could just do a

1736
01:44:25,020 --> 01:44:31,100
cell shaded, um, one that's like the other, I don't know, but I have no problem with it.

1737
01:44:32,940 --> 01:44:37,340
Going to our chat room for some always a great gems in our chat room, chat.orangetontrady.com

1738
01:44:37,340 --> 01:44:40,620
Legend of Zaku says, are you shitting me? There's no pleasing these diehards.

1739
01:44:40,620 --> 01:44:47,180
Uh, dark Tetsuya says, nah, they'll just charge for DLC to reskin them. Sad, but probably true.

1740
01:44:47,180 --> 01:44:51,980
Uh, let's see. Blades of Steel says, yeah, um, internet petitions don't work. And, uh,

1741
01:44:51,980 --> 01:44:56,220
Ray Iannami, I love this comment says, Sonic, I'm a really happy for you and I'm gonna let

1742
01:44:56,220 --> 01:44:59,420
you finish, but Twilight has one of the dumbest fan bases of all time.

1743
01:44:59,420 --> 01:45:08,140
Take from that what you will. Huh? Yeah. Hey, let's go to the mailbag.

1744
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:16,700
Every week we invite you guys to send us emails at mailbag at orangelauntrady.com. And, uh,

1745
01:45:16,700 --> 01:45:21,340
we read a few of your favorites here on the show. Since Dark Sakura's having voice issues tonight,

1746
01:45:21,340 --> 01:45:25,660
I'm going to go ahead and relieve her of her mailbag duties and I'll read the mailbag for her.

1747
01:45:25,660 --> 01:45:28,940
So again, send us your emails at mailbag at orangelauntrady.com. We just have a

1748
01:45:28,940 --> 01:45:32,700
couple of emails this week. Uh, not a whole lot to read tonight, but I do want to read

1749
01:45:32,700 --> 01:45:37,580
these couple quick emails that we have in the mailbag. Uh, we're going to start it off with

1750
01:45:37,580 --> 01:45:46,460
an email from, I don't see a signature, so I'll just say, um, Sam S from the email header.

1751
01:45:46,460 --> 01:45:50,940
Sam says, Hey guys, sorry about the shitty grammar. I'm on my PSP, fat. I just wanted to say,

1752
01:45:50,940 --> 01:45:55,420
I love the show. Keep up the good work, but please get the shows on the feed as fast as possible. I

1753
01:45:55,420 --> 01:46:02,780
get withdrawal from you guys. So keep it up G. All right, G. Well, I'm gonna tell you that we do try

1754
01:46:02,780 --> 01:46:08,140
to get the shows up like the day after we record now so far for 2010, even though we missed like

1755
01:46:08,140 --> 01:46:12,780
two weeks of show, just because there wasn't an actual show. Uh, I'm pretty good about getting

1756
01:46:12,780 --> 01:46:20,460
them up in 24 hours. So I'd like to pat myself on the back. Here's a much longer email tonight from

1757
01:46:20,460 --> 01:46:27,260
the name Molten Brown. One of my favorite, uh, nicknames that we have out there. Hey guys,

1758
01:46:27,260 --> 01:46:31,100
it's Molten Brown again. Yes, despite the humor over the name last time I wrote in,

1759
01:46:31,100 --> 01:46:34,700
I decided to keep it. Well, good for you. You stick by what you believe in Molten Brown.

1760
01:46:35,340 --> 01:46:39,420
I listened to your podcast from last week when you touched on the issue of developers rights again,

1761
01:46:39,420 --> 01:46:44,060
and I wanted to weigh in. It's my first year of law school and other than making me more cynical

1762
01:46:44,060 --> 01:46:48,540
about the legal system as a whole, I am realizing how many different things affect the outcome of a

1763
01:46:48,540 --> 01:46:53,580
lawsuit disclaimer. I could be completely wrong and I accept that, but this is my opinion based

1764
01:46:53,580 --> 01:46:58,380
on what I know. Fine by me. I'm welcoming of all opinions. And honestly, I don't think the

1765
01:46:58,380 --> 01:47:02,060
developers would have a chance against the companies unless they banded together. And even

1766
01:47:02,060 --> 01:47:06,300
then it would be questionable. I know the dark Sakura feels that if you don't do anything about

1767
01:47:06,300 --> 01:47:10,620
a bad situation, you are helping to create the situation. And I agree with her in part,

1768
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:14,220
but I also realized that the game companies are going to have a lot more money to defend

1769
01:47:14,220 --> 01:47:18,780
themselves than the developers. And this affects how good of lawyers they can get, what the lawyers

1770
01:47:18,780 --> 01:47:23,420
can do on their case, where the lawyer can devote more time to the case or has to juggle multiple

1771
01:47:23,420 --> 01:47:27,340
clients at the same time, and the influence they may have on the deciding of the case.

1772
01:47:27,340 --> 01:47:31,660
This assumption is based on a scenario where this case is filed in a state court with an elected

1773
01:47:31,660 --> 01:47:36,140
judge and the company or a parent company may have contributed funds to the judge's campaign.

1774
01:47:36,140 --> 01:47:40,060
And then there are the costs that come from having to file the case in court,

1775
01:47:40,060 --> 01:47:44,940
going through discovery and all the other steps of process. Developers may not have the monetary

1776
01:47:44,940 --> 01:47:49,260
means to defend themselves with the law, so even if they wanted to, it might not be possible.

1777
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:53,660
And that sucks. Sorry for being a downer, but I wanted to shed some light on some of the other

1778
01:47:53,660 --> 01:47:59,660
issues developers may face that prevent them from doing anything. And Molten Brown signs his email.

1779
01:47:59,660 --> 01:48:03,580
This email has been brought to you by Sleep Deprivation. Need a ready excuse for screwing

1780
01:48:03,580 --> 01:48:09,180
up? Sleep Deprivation may be the thing for you. Dark Sakura, any comments on the other

1781
01:48:09,180 --> 01:48:18,220
perspective there? No, I agree with it. I just still think that if it's still, I think that

1782
01:48:18,220 --> 01:48:23,660
people need to put the effort into, this is why I'm thinking it would be something like along the

1783
01:48:23,660 --> 01:48:29,100
lines of a class action lawsuit. Well, I kind of suggested this a couple of weeks ago and I

1784
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:33,260
realized this is a polarizing topic and I don't want to get too political, but I just want to

1785
01:48:33,260 --> 01:48:39,340
throw that idea out there and see what sticks. Unions. What if there was like a union for game

1786
01:48:39,340 --> 01:48:43,420
developers that they kind of banded together and then maybe could afford some of these things,

1787
01:48:43,420 --> 01:48:46,620
you know what I mean? Like granted, then you get all these like the dues that goes with it,

1788
01:48:46,620 --> 01:48:50,780
but at least there'll be like a union to fight for rights. But look, I realize it's a polarizing

1789
01:48:50,780 --> 01:48:54,620
topic, but I just want to throw the idea out there. I mean, can you tell me what's right or

1790
01:48:54,620 --> 01:48:58,300
what's wrong with that idea? I think it's a good idea. It's just the whole point that it's sad that

1791
01:48:58,300 --> 01:49:03,660
we're dealing with, you know, that level of corruption, I think, in the system. So if you

1792
01:49:03,660 --> 01:49:06,780
want to continue this debate next week, that's fine. But if you're going to email us on this

1793
01:49:06,780 --> 01:49:09,900
topic again at mailbagatorangeloungeradio.com, I really want to hear your thoughts on the

1794
01:49:09,900 --> 01:49:15,180
whole union idea. Good idea, bad idea, whatever idea. That was really it for emails this week.

1795
01:49:15,180 --> 01:49:20,940
Mailbagatorangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us more emails. Okay. What was that?

1796
01:49:21,980 --> 01:49:25,900
Having a child melt down in the other room. Yeah, I can hear. It's all right. We're going to still

1797
01:49:25,900 --> 01:49:30,140
try to continue with the show. After the mailbag, we always like to take a minute to say,

1798
01:49:30,140 --> 01:49:34,540
F U to things that are making us angry. It's a little segment we call the FUs of the week.

1799
01:49:34,540 --> 01:49:52,940
Dark Soccer, do you have any angst for us tonight? Being sick.

1800
01:49:53,980 --> 01:49:58,940
Loki. Um, not really, actually. Oh, amazing.

1801
01:49:58,940 --> 01:50:05,980
Really? You're just in a good mood. Everything's happy. I'm in a complacent mood. Oh, good to hear

1802
01:50:05,980 --> 01:50:11,260
it. Um, I don't really have a lot of FUs either. I feel like I should have something. Um, I'll just

1803
01:50:11,260 --> 01:50:15,740
give another FU to moving and having to get everything in boxes and all that good stuff. I'm

1804
01:50:15,740 --> 01:50:19,820
not looking forward to moving, but at least it'll be over after this week. Oh, and an FU to my car.

1805
01:50:21,260 --> 01:50:24,860
There's always a new surprise with what breaks down in my car. And today it's the air conditioner.

1806
01:50:24,860 --> 01:50:31,420
When you turn on the fan, now you hear this, like, I think the fan itself is just like about

1807
01:50:31,420 --> 01:50:36,380
to spin loose and probably, uh, fly off my car in the moment. Goody goody.

1808
01:50:39,900 --> 01:50:41,740
Fun time. It's going to do it for the FUs of the week.

1809
01:50:42,860 --> 01:50:47,020
All right. Uh, let's move on with some more, uh, new stories. Just a couple more for you guys.

1810
01:50:47,020 --> 01:50:51,260
Then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1 8 7 7 game O L R or username on Skype,

1811
01:50:51,260 --> 01:50:55,420
orange lounge radio. Do you remember if you're going to use the Skype client to actually call us

1812
01:50:55,420 --> 01:51:00,060
call echo 1 2 3 first, if you've never been on the show before, even if you have been on the

1813
01:51:00,060 --> 01:51:05,180
show before, you might just want to double check that you're okay. Uh, during the 2009 fiscal

1814
01:51:05,180 --> 01:51:12,220
earnings report from, um, Activision CEO, Michael Griffith noted that bizarre creations, um, would

1815
01:51:12,220 --> 01:51:19,980
be doing a multiplayer beta for blur next month. Uh, they didn't specify, um, when it's going to be,

1816
01:51:19,980 --> 01:51:27,260
um, or when exactly it's going to be. Um, but that at least it'll be on, um,

1817
01:51:28,940 --> 01:51:32,540
the X-Box three six. Well, they didn't say that's stupid. They didn't say what platforms

1818
01:51:32,540 --> 01:51:38,780
the games coming in are coming out on PlayStation three and X-Box three 60, but, um, no word on

1819
01:51:38,780 --> 01:51:43,580
which platform actually going to do the beta for. So, well, I'm excited for blur. It was

1820
01:51:43,580 --> 01:51:47,980
one of my favorite things we saw at E3 last year. It's, you know, Mario cart meets burnout. I think

1821
01:51:47,980 --> 01:51:52,860
it was why I was calling it before. It'll be neat. I know I'm excited for it. All right. And the last

1822
01:51:52,860 --> 01:51:56,860
story I have for you guys tonight has to do with game room. Of course, I'm pretty excited about

1823
01:51:56,860 --> 01:52:01,180
game room. I love my classic games and there are some more tidbits coming out of the X 10 event

1824
01:52:01,180 --> 01:52:06,140
when it comes to game room. Uh, apparently five to seven games a week are supposed to be added

1825
01:52:06,140 --> 01:52:09,820
for download. That's what they're claiming. We'll see if it becomes a reality or not.

1826
01:52:09,820 --> 01:52:13,740
Uh, they want to do like a weekly release on a particular day, kind of like what they do for

1827
01:52:13,740 --> 01:52:19,100
rock band or the X-Box live arcade. Uh, right now they're looking at Thursday, but that could change.

1828
01:52:19,980 --> 01:52:23,980
Also, apparently they're going to add some incentives for you to get games the day that

1829
01:52:23,980 --> 01:52:29,340
they come out. So if you like buy a game, the day it comes out, it will be a special item that stays

1830
01:52:29,340 --> 01:52:33,980
with you in your personal game room. Um, one of the things that, uh, the game room producer,

1831
01:52:33,980 --> 01:52:39,020
Fred Norton was showing off was a helicopter that flew around the player's avatar. Uh, the day one

1832
01:52:39,020 --> 01:52:44,700
exclusives would be different for every game. It would somehow tie on tie into the game's iconography.

1833
01:52:44,700 --> 01:52:49,660
So like, you know, um, and I, if you really watch that game room trailer, you see like, you can see

1834
01:52:49,660 --> 01:52:54,780
like a little yellow dragon from adventure rendered in 3d, which I know sounds weird, but it's like

1835
01:52:54,780 --> 01:52:58,700
walking around the little play house. I bet it would be little things like that, that you're going

1836
01:52:58,700 --> 01:53:04,060
to get for day one releases. I would imagine. So have they mentioned how you're going to be able

1837
01:53:04,060 --> 01:53:07,660
to go to like friends game rooms and stuff like that? Cause what's the point in decorating your

1838
01:53:07,660 --> 01:53:12,700
own game room? If only you see it. No, they haven't. And I'm thinking it, I wouldn't, um,

1839
01:53:12,700 --> 01:53:16,300
I wouldn't get too excited about this. I think it's just going to be that you have your game room

1840
01:53:16,300 --> 01:53:20,060
and you can go look at others games room. I would think that you would at least be able to play a

1841
01:53:20,060 --> 01:53:24,060
demo, but you know what it is. It's going to be the way for them to solicit the quarters.

1842
01:53:24,060 --> 01:53:28,700
I, you probably will do a lot of your 40 Microsoft point play or your 50 cent play

1843
01:53:28,700 --> 01:53:32,220
visiting other people's game rooms. I think that's the whole idea behind it is go visit

1844
01:53:32,220 --> 01:53:38,380
your friends game rooms and try out their machines for 40 points at pop. I bet you that's what it is.

1845
01:53:39,900 --> 01:53:44,700
So we'll see though. There's a still a ways to go before the end of March when game room is

1846
01:53:44,700 --> 01:53:51,020
expected to come out and hopefully our questions will be answered by then. So that does it for the

1847
01:53:51,020 --> 01:53:55,260
scheduled stories we have tonight. We're going to go ahead and go to the Skypline first though,

1848
01:53:55,260 --> 01:53:59,260
before we get to the Skypline and I, I want to play this voicemail, uh, because this is

1849
01:53:59,260 --> 01:54:02,860
about something we probably haven't talked enough about on the show, but it is a big

1850
01:54:02,860 --> 01:54:05,660
thing going on in our website right now. So let me play this voicemail first.

1851
01:54:05,660 --> 01:54:26,060
Hi Rob, this is Brett Wall from Undertation Live. Our show is on hiatus, so I'm leaving the voicemail to Orange Lawrence Radio, reminding all of your listeners to participate in QSL Madness. I'm getting distracted, but we're around 64 right now. There's some fantastic

1852
01:54:26,060 --> 01:54:38,940
match-ups going on. All you need is a form account and a hand to click your mouse with. Uh, it's all on our form. Uh, they're at www.orangeloungeradio.com. Be sure to visit and hello to everybody out there at Orange

1853
01:54:38,940 --> 01:54:43,180
Lawrence Radio Land. We miss you on QSL. Anyways, talk to you later tonight.

1854
01:54:44,540 --> 01:54:48,060
Thank you very much, Bresl from uh, Undertation Live. I didn't know they were on hiatus. What's

1855
01:54:48,060 --> 01:54:51,420
going on there? Like, well, I thought I saw a tweet about it, but I don't know. Sometimes like

1856
01:54:51,420 --> 01:54:54,940
Travis threatens to go on hiatus, but then doesn't really go on hiatus. So I hope everything's okay

1857
01:54:54,940 --> 01:55:00,460
over at QSL Land. So uh, whatever. Uh, I hope you guys get better or whatever's going on. Um, but yes,

1858
01:55:00,460 --> 01:55:05,820
Undertation Live Madness, the um, big battle to figure out the greatest video game of all time

1859
01:55:05,820 --> 01:55:10,060
is going on right now on the Orange Lawrence Radio forums. Um, it's kind of some surprising things

1860
01:55:10,060 --> 01:55:14,700
going on there. Like, I, I kind of lost my shit and got angry when Time Crisis beat Civilization,

1861
01:55:14,700 --> 01:55:20,540
which I think is a travesty. But whatever, I'll leave my opinions on the forums. Um, you can vote

1862
01:55:20,540 --> 01:55:23,820
for whichever game you like more and then they kind of, you know, whittle their way down. It's

1863
01:55:23,820 --> 01:55:28,940
kind of modeled after like a March Madness, you know, NCAA kind of thing, uh, to the greatest

1864
01:55:28,940 --> 01:55:34,460
video game of all time, which Super Metroid won one year. I think, uh, Mario 3 won it last year.

1865
01:55:34,460 --> 01:55:38,300
And so we'll see who wins this year. There's a bunch of stuff going on on the forums right now.

1866
01:55:38,300 --> 01:55:41,980
So if you haven't checked that out, check that out on the forums at OrangeLawrenceRadio.com. There's

1867
01:55:41,980 --> 01:55:49,180
a whole little March Madness section there. So take a look. All right. Um, we're gonna go to

1868
01:55:49,180 --> 01:55:53,580
the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR. We're now open for business on the Skype line. Go ahead and give

1869
01:55:53,580 --> 01:55:58,220
us a call if you'd like, and we'll take some calls. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

1870
01:55:59,180 --> 01:56:02,780
This is dsmaster26. Hey, dsmaster. What's on your mind?

1871
01:56:04,460 --> 01:56:12,620
Uh, not much. Other than I participated in the finale of 1 vs. 100, which was perceived to be

1872
01:56:12,620 --> 01:56:19,900
a Halo fan-gasm, as you will. Really? Did that happen tonight? Was the 1 vs. 100 finale tonight?

1873
01:56:19,900 --> 01:56:25,820
No, it was, uh, it was two days ago. So what did they do? What made it such a

1874
01:56:25,820 --> 01:56:28,940
Halo fan-gasm? I missed it. I forgot that the season was coming to an end.

1875
01:56:29,900 --> 01:56:37,180
They had two of the creators from Halo, three and three of you, actually the creators of the whole

1876
01:56:37,180 --> 01:56:46,060
series on that, talking about, um, the Halo series and Halo Legends, seeing them coming out soon.

1877
01:56:46,060 --> 01:56:50,860
And they were giving away three copies, um, to those who got some Halo questions right,

1878
01:56:51,740 --> 01:56:56,060
of the Halo Legends anime. Was there any mention of, um, the whole news

1879
01:56:56,060 --> 01:57:00,700
about Xbox Live? Because I know this, this just happened a couple weeks ago, about original Xbox

1880
01:57:00,700 --> 01:57:04,860
Live shutting down for original Xbox, and how that will impact Halo 2. Did that come up at all?

1881
01:57:06,780 --> 01:57:11,340
I did not talk about that. Uh, I guess that doesn't really surprise

1882
01:57:11,340 --> 01:57:14,780
me. I just kind of wondered if that would come up at all. Did they say anything during the

1883
01:57:14,780 --> 01:57:21,980
finale about the next season of One vs. 100? Um, they said there is definitely going to be

1884
01:57:21,980 --> 01:57:27,020
season three, but they don't know exactly when it's possibly going to start. Um,

1885
01:57:28,700 --> 01:57:35,660
damn, it's cold in Nebraska. And the sky is blue, what else is new?

1886
01:57:35,660 --> 01:57:40,380
I got a little bit of a news announcement for you guys, because, uh, the broadcasting class

1887
01:57:40,380 --> 01:57:46,060
from the Career Center over here in Omaha, Nebraska, is coming all the way to Anaheim,

1888
01:57:46,060 --> 01:57:51,500
California. All right, wait, wait, I gotta take it back to One vs. 100 for a minute here.

1889
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:55,500
What do you want to see in season three? Huh?

1890
01:57:55,500 --> 01:57:58,860
What, what do you want to see in season three of One vs. 100?

1891
01:57:58,860 --> 01:58:10,940
Ooh, um, probably them to try to get, oh god, probably the guys behind DJ Hero or something,

1892
01:58:10,940 --> 01:58:15,340
like in, like, I don't know, something like Lady Gaga or something.

1893
01:58:15,340 --> 01:58:22,300
So, I agree, Lady Gaga would be great. So, so more guests. I did tune, I did play the One,

1894
01:58:22,300 --> 01:58:27,980
One vs. 100, uh, when Jeff Probst was a guest promoting his Survivor and all that stuff, so.

1895
01:58:27,980 --> 01:58:30,860
Oh, and actually, um, that same night with the Halo guys,

1896
01:58:31,580 --> 01:58:36,700
Jimmy Fallon, um, popped in once or twice. Oh, interesting. Was he funny?

1897
01:58:38,540 --> 01:58:40,780
He was definitely funny. Well, that's a first.

1898
01:58:40,780 --> 01:58:44,860
He also plays One vs. 100. I see. Uh, one other quick question for you,

1899
01:58:44,860 --> 01:58:47,580
DiazMaster, then we're gonna let you go. But a couple weeks ago here on the show,

1900
01:58:47,580 --> 01:58:52,460
we were talking about, you know, maybe Xbox should consider some other game shows besides

1901
01:58:52,460 --> 01:58:56,940
just One vs. 100. Is there a game show that you think Xbox should be doing as a game show

1902
01:58:56,940 --> 01:59:01,100
besides just One vs. 100? Ooh. Well,

1903
01:59:02,460 --> 01:59:07,900
there are three game shows in my mind that would be really good for Xbox 5 in that same

1904
01:59:07,900 --> 01:59:11,020
spiel that One vs. 100 is going at. Mm-hmm.

1905
01:59:11,020 --> 01:59:19,100
Um, and, sorry, but not really. Deal or no deal, no. That's a no-go. But, uh, probably

1906
01:59:19,100 --> 01:59:22,140
Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, that'd be good. Oh, okay.

1907
01:59:22,140 --> 01:59:24,380
Because that was a video game years ago. Good idea.

1908
01:59:24,380 --> 01:59:28,860
But I think it probably could take up on the lot.

1909
01:59:28,860 --> 01:59:34,620
I also give a big fat no to Deal or No Deal because I, it's, I hate that game show. I

1910
01:59:34,620 --> 01:59:38,540
think it's a terrible game show. It's the worst game show, one of the, one of the worst

1911
01:59:38,540 --> 01:59:43,420
they've ever done because Deal or No Deal takes absolutely no skill. There is zero skill

1912
01:59:43,420 --> 01:59:45,900
involved. Speaking of Deal or No Deal, it's become,

1913
01:59:45,900 --> 01:59:48,380
um, you know those ticket redemption games, right?

1914
01:59:48,380 --> 01:59:51,340
Yeah, I've played it. They need a Deal or No Deal for that now.

1915
01:59:51,340 --> 01:59:56,300
I've played it. I hate to admit I played it. Uh, my friend, it wasn't me, but one of my

1916
01:59:56,300 --> 02:00:02,300
friends actually got all the way down to opening the final case and won the jackpot. I was

1917
02:00:02,300 --> 02:00:05,820
amazed. But then I also wasn't because I was like,

1918
02:00:05,820 --> 02:00:08,380
she just got lucky because there's no skill involved.

1919
02:00:09,740 --> 02:00:14,780
There are two game shows in my mind would probably have to be like Real Fortune, that'd

1920
02:00:14,780 --> 02:00:22,300
be pretty good. And, um, Hollywood Squares. Now Hollywood Squares I'd be down with. That

1921
02:00:22,300 --> 02:00:24,780
would be pretty funny. You could totally do the process right.

1922
02:00:24,780 --> 02:00:28,700
I know you could. You could, but they won't. All right. Well, uh, DS Master.

1923
02:00:29,900 --> 02:00:35,100
Just to let you know, you're, I don't know what year it's my phone or something, but

1924
02:00:35,100 --> 02:00:40,460
the audio when you're speaking on my end, like you're sounding a little bit crackly.

1925
02:00:40,460 --> 02:00:44,620
I don't know what's up. Um, it's demons in the phone system.

1926
02:00:47,340 --> 02:00:49,500
Damn. All right. Have a good night DS Master.

1927
02:00:50,380 --> 02:00:53,820
All right. You too and happy Valentine's Day, O.L.R. crew.

1928
02:00:53,820 --> 02:00:58,780
Later. I don't know what that is. I, it's always going to sound a little weird over

1929
02:00:58,780 --> 02:01:04,220
our little rig set up here, but do remember if you do call O.L.R., turn your volume down

1930
02:01:04,220 --> 02:01:08,060
a lot so that you don't get picked up. In fact, it's even best to turn it off, but just

1931
02:01:08,060 --> 02:01:13,180
like, or mute it or something. Just keep that in mind. Uh, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username

1932
02:01:13,180 --> 02:01:17,660
on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio on Skype. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1933
02:01:19,020 --> 02:01:22,140
Hi, this is Spazinator. Hi Spazinator. What's on your mind?

1934
02:01:23,820 --> 02:01:29,660
Uh, you know, well, one, uh, one issue is, uh, kind of, uh, you know, compound issue.

1935
02:01:30,220 --> 02:01:34,300
Um, I didn't know if you saw my 1-3 from earlier, but I kind of want to take, uh,

1936
02:01:34,300 --> 02:01:39,020
Sony to ask about, uh, problems I'm having. Please do.

1937
02:01:40,460 --> 02:01:49,660
Yeah, uh, you know, my initial problem is, is, uh, my PlayStation 3, uh, just last weekend,

1938
02:01:49,660 --> 02:01:53,180
got the dreaded yellow white of death. Uh-oh.

1939
02:01:53,180 --> 02:02:04,780
Yeah, uh, you know, uh, I'm sure you, you know, Dr. Sakura and, uh, you know, Loki, all, you know,

1940
02:02:04,780 --> 02:02:12,060
know the, you know, what that is or won't even bother to, you know, explain it, but, uh, there's

1941
02:02:12,060 --> 02:02:16,780
so much music. Are you just mad about the yellow light or did something happen in trying to get it

1942
02:02:16,780 --> 02:02:28,300
fixed? Uh, using so much, uh, the yellow white of death, uh, I know that systems fail and I can

1943
02:02:28,300 --> 02:02:34,620
always, you know, and I plan on taking it to Sony every six. There isn't so much a problem.

1944
02:02:35,340 --> 02:02:42,700
Where the problem lies is that when I explained the situation to one of the Sony reps and told

1945
02:02:42,700 --> 02:02:47,420
them that they need to send my system in for repairs, I need to explain to them that, uh,

1946
02:02:48,220 --> 02:02:53,260
I have two profiles on my system. One, you want to work just for, for, for gaming ones,

1947
02:02:53,260 --> 02:03:01,180
for purchasing movies and games we chose. And I have a lot of video content that purchases the

1948
02:03:01,180 --> 02:03:10,540
store. And, uh, I was concerned about, you know, uh, being able to play the videos that I purchased,

1949
02:03:10,540 --> 02:03:16,460
uh, you know, once I get the system back, cause, you know, they get really wonky DRM.

1950
02:03:17,420 --> 02:03:22,140
And to paraphrase what, you know, if they're one rep said, you know,

1951
02:03:23,100 --> 02:03:26,860
there's like a 50-50 chance that you may lose all your content.

1952
02:03:29,100 --> 02:03:36,540
A 50-50 chance? What the hell kind of advice is that? That's weird. I interpret that as

1953
02:03:36,540 --> 02:03:41,500
there's a zero chance. They're giving you false hope and that's pretty disgusting. And I remember

1954
02:03:41,500 --> 02:03:47,100
you went through this whole mess not that long ago with some, you lost like all your DRM to video

1955
02:03:47,100 --> 02:03:51,740
content and you finally got it. Like I remember you called us and we said, don't, don't take no

1956
02:03:51,740 --> 02:03:55,500
for an answer. You keep calling back. And finally you, you, you were able to get some of it back,

1957
02:03:55,500 --> 02:03:57,500
but it sounds like they're running you through that gauntlet again.

1958
02:03:57,500 --> 02:04:06,460
Yeah, yeah, exactly. And my, my, my problem, my, uh, why you thought is to, you know,

1959
02:04:06,460 --> 02:04:14,220
follow with what you just said is that I pay through the notes for all this content, you know,

1960
02:04:14,220 --> 02:04:22,540
you know, uh, two to three bucks per TV episode. You know, yeah, I got a whole shit ton of them,

1961
02:04:22,540 --> 02:04:29,900
uh, and plus 10 to $15 per movie, you know, and I get like hundreds and hundreds of videos,

1962
02:04:29,900 --> 02:04:36,940
so needless to say, that's a lot of money. And, you know, you know, I expect that since I pay

1963
02:04:36,940 --> 02:04:42,540
for all this stuff, I should be able to use it. And, you know, I ran out right now. I have, uh,

1964
02:04:42,540 --> 02:04:49,660
a hardware failure, you know, which like I have to send my machine into it repaired, but once I

1965
02:04:49,660 --> 02:04:55,500
get, you know, the machine repair, I should be able to play the content that I purchased, you

1966
02:04:55,500 --> 02:05:02,620
know, please keep us posted with what happens after the repair and everything, because, um,

1967
02:05:02,620 --> 02:05:07,740
you know, or which side of the 50 50 or whatever you end up on, because if you do lose your access

1968
02:05:07,740 --> 02:05:11,820
to all that and they don't do anything about it, I want to help put it out there in the public

1969
02:05:11,820 --> 02:05:16,540
because everybody needs to think twice about buying a damn thing from Sony. If you know,

1970
02:05:16,540 --> 02:05:21,180
this is the way they're going to treat it as like, well, there's a 50 50 chance it might still work.

1971
02:05:21,180 --> 02:05:25,900
This is why people hate DRM. And if they're going to leave the door wide open like this,

1972
02:05:25,900 --> 02:05:30,380
people need to know to not support it. And I would really encourage you that if Sony does not do the

1973
02:05:30,380 --> 02:05:36,380
right thing, does not satisfy you, does not leave you a satisfied customer, stop buying stuff on the

1974
02:05:36,380 --> 02:05:39,580
marketplace. I know that's going to be painful. I know you use them a lot, but you're going to have

1975
02:05:39,580 --> 02:05:46,620
to explore alternatives. You have to, you owe it to yourself. Yeah. Uh, what, why I kept playing for

1976
02:05:46,620 --> 02:05:53,340
me, which I already mentioned on Twitter and Facebook is, uh, I never had to fit my system in

1977
02:05:53,340 --> 02:06:00,140
just yet, because I'm waiting on a check from a social security disability PE to cover the, the,

1978
02:06:00,140 --> 02:06:07,260
the cost of the repairs. But once I do get that check, um, I'm going to call Sony again,

1979
02:06:07,260 --> 02:06:14,940
uh, get the ball rolling on the repair. And when I do that, I got to speak directly to a supervisor

1980
02:06:14,940 --> 02:06:20,220
like I did the last time. Good idea. We're going to have to wrap up so we get to some more calls,

1981
02:06:20,220 --> 02:06:26,300
but please keep us posted on what happens. I'm sure we'll do. All right. You too. Take care

1982
02:06:26,300 --> 02:06:31,660
about it. Good luck. Let us know what happens, man. That's that is irritating. I would be so

1983
02:06:31,660 --> 02:06:35,580
mad if I was him right now. Um, and I love what Brad is saying here in chat. And again,

1984
02:06:35,580 --> 02:06:39,660
we don't know what the end result's going to be. So we'll see. But Brad says, says in chat,

1985
02:06:39,660 --> 02:06:44,140
shit like this is why I just torrent my video content. Dude. Look, he was just having this

1986
02:06:44,140 --> 02:06:49,020
whole spiel on piracy earlier. Like this is it right here. Like people pirate because of DRM.

1987
02:06:49,020 --> 02:06:55,260
And if you want to know legitimately why there might be a fraction of a reason to support piracy,

1988
02:06:55,260 --> 02:07:00,780
listen to spassinators call. Like I would only like if, if his thing comes back and none of

1989
02:07:00,780 --> 02:07:05,580
his content works again, I'm going to be like, dude, you should be pirating things on the PlayStation

1990
02:07:05,580 --> 02:07:08,300
marketplace. Cause that's the only way you're going to get around the DRM. I don't see why

1991
02:07:08,300 --> 02:07:14,540
it wouldn't work because it's tied to his account, not his system. We had the problem before,

1992
02:07:14,540 --> 02:07:19,020
but dude, can you believe a rep told him there's a 50 50 chance you're going to lose it all.

1993
02:07:19,020 --> 02:07:22,540
People working for all companies. It's like saying I might like you and I might not just,

1994
02:07:22,540 --> 02:07:27,580
I don't know. As a customer service trainer, that irritates me. Call back and talk to a different

1995
02:07:27,580 --> 02:07:32,540
rep. Let's get to another call. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Good morning.

1996
02:07:32,540 --> 02:07:37,340
This is from the West coast of Sweden. This is Judith speaking. Well, hello. Another Swedish

1997
02:07:37,340 --> 02:07:42,620
listener. Do you know AK ripper? No, I don't know him, but I heard him on the, a couple of the last

1998
02:07:42,620 --> 02:07:47,660
episode. I think he called in and I've heard him a bunch of times. So I figured I'd try and get on

1999
02:07:47,660 --> 02:07:52,780
and represent Sweden. Well, Hey, we're all about dude. We're like getting bigger than ABBA. All

2000
02:07:52,780 --> 02:07:57,820
right. No. All right. So to what do we owe this phone call tonight? What's on your mind?

2001
02:07:57,820 --> 02:08:02,220
I have a couple of things. First, I would like to do like a shout out to the person who

2002
02:08:03,180 --> 02:08:08,380
directed me to orange launch radio and got me to start listening to it. And that's Dalit,

2003
02:08:08,380 --> 02:08:15,660
it's D A L 33 T. I don't think he's ever called in or been on the chat, but I just want to give

2004
02:08:15,660 --> 02:08:19,980
him big thank you. And hopefully he hears this and gets back to me. Dalit, thank you for being

2005
02:08:19,980 --> 02:08:24,540
leet because we always do say at the end of the show, um, if you like orange on his radio, tell

2006
02:08:24,540 --> 02:08:29,340
a friend or two about the show and help us spread the word. Clearly leet has done that and gets a

2007
02:08:29,340 --> 02:08:34,540
gold star for his efforts. Thank you. And happy first call to the show. Yes. And happy first call

2008
02:08:34,540 --> 02:08:40,060
to the show. Hopefully I'll have many more. Um, and I also have a question. Uh, you had

2009
02:08:40,060 --> 02:08:45,500
talked about some bit, a bit about piracy before, and if it's such a big concern and there's been

2010
02:08:45,500 --> 02:08:49,260
a lot of talking about it in the chat, if, what, what should they do to prevent it? Should they

2011
02:08:49,260 --> 02:08:55,020
have more DRM, less DRM, more extreme DRM, like maybe having to take a photo of your receipt and

2012
02:08:55,020 --> 02:08:59,980
then send it in and have, have to call in and then have it activated online or what should,

2013
02:08:59,980 --> 02:09:04,780
what should companies do to prevent piracy? You know, I don't think there's an easy answer. I

2014
02:09:04,780 --> 02:09:10,060
think if that answer were out there, it would be probably be being done right now. It's not easy to

2015
02:09:10,060 --> 02:09:15,260
solve, but how should they go about trying to sort of watch up what approach, more restrictions

2016
02:09:15,260 --> 02:09:24,220
or more freedom or I'm not a fan of the program based DRM. I prefer activation codes though they

2017
02:09:24,220 --> 02:09:32,300
are easier to bypass. Um, but for an example of it being effective, um, when I was given Guild Wars

2018
02:09:32,300 --> 02:09:37,660
as a present and my activation code had been scratched off, I couldn't find a generator.

2019
02:09:37,660 --> 02:09:44,380
I couldn't do anything. I actually took a photo of my code and gave them the serial number off

2020
02:09:44,380 --> 02:09:51,420
of my box. They sent me a new code and that to me I think is less frustrating than having to

2021
02:09:51,420 --> 02:09:56,300
deal with something that's going to install on your system or having to redownload things.

2022
02:09:56,300 --> 02:10:02,220
I think we're only a few years away from mandatory internet activation and you see a lot of products

2023
02:10:02,220 --> 02:10:06,460
already going that way and I think always there's these kind of like outs. Well, what about the

2024
02:10:06,460 --> 02:10:10,940
military people who don't have internet connection or you know, in, in some parts of America out in

2025
02:10:10,940 --> 02:10:14,780
the Midwest where, you know, there's, there's more remote parts of the country. Not everybody

2026
02:10:14,780 --> 02:10:19,020
has a high speed and constant internet connection, but you know, in, in five more years, I don't

2027
02:10:19,020 --> 02:10:21,980
think that's going to be the case. I think you're going to get a lot more places in the world wired

2028
02:10:21,980 --> 02:10:27,020
on the internet. I think that's where things are going to go. Do I think they should go there?

2029
02:10:27,900 --> 02:10:34,380
Maybe not, but that's where they're going to go. Um, I always miss the old, uh, you have to look in

2030
02:10:34,380 --> 02:10:39,660
the manual to look at the faces or match things up. And that's how they used to do the old PC

2031
02:10:39,660 --> 02:10:45,100
uh, stuff back in the day. But that's a photo copy that I know, but I missed that stuff. Okay. Here's

2032
02:10:45,100 --> 02:10:49,580
my real answer though, is that, um, I think one way that they could do it is, is kind of one thing

2033
02:10:49,580 --> 02:10:53,820
they're doing is it's kind of one of those fight fire with fire is that the publishers themselves

2034
02:10:53,820 --> 02:10:58,140
go out on these torrent sites and put the games up for download, but they're borked versions

2035
02:10:58,140 --> 02:11:03,820
like the whole, uh, you remember Arkham asylum was criminal and stuff like that. Yeah. Honestly,

2036
02:11:03,820 --> 02:11:09,020
I know it's a weird approach and maybe it's not like my favorite thing that they should do,

2037
02:11:09,020 --> 02:11:12,620
but I support the developers fighting fire with fire. It's not going to work though that way.

2038
02:11:12,620 --> 02:11:17,820
The reason why is because the communities now that have, you know, all the release sites and

2039
02:11:17,820 --> 02:11:22,460
stuff like that, they recognize that there's a borked version on there and they will basically

2040
02:11:22,460 --> 02:11:28,060
nuke it. And so it comes off the list of releases and then they'll wait for a legitimate release

2041
02:11:28,060 --> 02:11:33,420
group to release the title on there. So that may work in the short run, but people will find,

2042
02:11:33,420 --> 02:11:38,940
or, you know, as in the case of Batman Arkham asylum, people will find a way around it within

2043
02:11:38,940 --> 02:11:46,380
like a day that, and that will be done for. So really the easiest way to do it. And unfortunately

2044
02:11:46,380 --> 02:11:52,140
it is going to be the mandatory online and you know, um, activations. It's basically going to be

2045
02:11:52,140 --> 02:11:56,220
a code inside like a manual or something like that, that they're going to have to, you know,

2046
02:11:56,220 --> 02:12:02,620
enter in to some online services, download a key or something, or it's going to be, you know,

2047
02:12:02,620 --> 02:12:06,060
inside the manual and you put it in the game and then people will find a way to a key generator

2048
02:12:06,060 --> 02:12:10,860
around it. So no matter what they do, people will find a way around it. I got one more thought,

2049
02:12:10,860 --> 02:12:14,220
and then I'm sure you want to say something on this too. My other thought would be, I think the

2050
02:12:14,220 --> 02:12:19,260
best way to probably stop piracy or, or at least curb it, I don't think you will ever stop it,

2051
02:12:19,260 --> 02:12:25,420
but to curb it, I think you make it cheap. You make it stupid. Like, and I would point at iTunes

2052
02:12:25,420 --> 02:12:29,260
as an example of that, you know, iTunes kind of showed up in the wake of Napster, you know,

2053
02:12:29,260 --> 02:12:33,580
Napster got shut down. Obviously iTunes kind of showed up as like a legitimate way of doing

2054
02:12:33,580 --> 02:12:37,660
something like Napster. And the cool thing about iTunes, and I think one reason why it's been very

2055
02:12:37,660 --> 02:12:43,420
successful, it's easy enough for my mother to use. It's cheap, 99 cents a song, and stupid. Click

2056
02:12:43,420 --> 02:12:47,580
button, purchase song. I think that's why digital distribution and things like Steam are starting

2057
02:12:47,580 --> 02:12:51,980
to get more and more, and I think Steam is going to pick up, pardon the pun, Steam, and you're

2058
02:12:51,980 --> 02:12:58,380
going to see more, you know, these blowout sales, $9.99 for a game, click button, receive game.

2059
02:12:58,380 --> 02:13:03,500
Well, also it doesn't, it gives you the illusion of having not really spent anything because you're

2060
02:13:03,500 --> 02:13:10,940
not dealing with a tangible item. You know, it's, you're not cashing out money using your card.

2061
02:13:10,940 --> 02:13:16,300
You're just clicking a button and there you go. Your information is already there, which it does

2062
02:13:16,300 --> 02:13:22,380
encourage people to spend more. I'm guilty of the same, like Amazon's one click. That gets me. I buy

2063
02:13:22,380 --> 02:13:27,980
books on Kindle and end up paying too much. And look at, look at the 360, as, as Bobby lovingly

2064
02:13:27,980 --> 02:13:31,820
refers to it, the Microsoft space bucks. That's all just an elaborate illusion that you're spending

2065
02:13:31,820 --> 02:13:36,300
real money. Anyhow, caller, I know you probably have something you want to say on this. What are

2066
02:13:36,300 --> 02:13:41,180
your thoughts on your own question? Uh, I think they need to take away the DRM and make it,

2067
02:13:41,180 --> 02:13:44,780
like you said, make it cheaper and make it, encourage people to buy it. Cause having,

2068
02:13:44,780 --> 02:13:48,940
it's like the, I had a painful experience with Bioshock when I first bought it,

2069
02:13:49,820 --> 02:13:53,980
because you can install it like five times and you have to do an online activation. And after

2070
02:13:53,980 --> 02:14:00,380
five times you have to call in and if you want to get help to get reactivated. And then I heard

2071
02:14:00,380 --> 02:14:04,540
from a friend who pirated it and he didn't have any troubles. It was super easy for him. And it

2072
02:14:04,540 --> 02:14:10,140
feels like if I buy something, I should get more than someone who pirates it, not less. I shouldn't

2073
02:14:10,140 --> 02:14:15,500
be punished for paying. Dude, I'm with you. And that's almost like, like our last caller,

2074
02:14:15,500 --> 02:14:19,980
the guy who's having problems with his video content. He's being punished for his hardware

2075
02:14:19,980 --> 02:14:24,220
breaking and him trying to support things and do things the legal way. You expect anybody to

2076
02:14:24,220 --> 02:14:29,260
support your account. And that's why I said, dude, spazzinator, if it stops working, you need to just

2077
02:14:29,260 --> 02:14:34,460
stop supporting Sony like that. I mean, he's a, he's, he champions for Sony a lot on this show,

2078
02:14:34,460 --> 02:14:38,780
but if they're not going to return the favor to him, they can go F themselves and we should

2079
02:14:38,780 --> 02:14:43,260
bring it to light that, you know, if you use the Sony video marketplace to buy content,

2080
02:14:43,260 --> 02:14:48,060
it could possibly be a ticking time bomb. Hopefully it comes out next week that this was

2081
02:14:48,060 --> 02:14:56,060
all just a big scare from a bonehead rep at Sony. Let's hope. Anyhow.

2082
02:14:56,860 --> 02:15:01,500
Well, I'm not going to take up more of your time. I'm going to wish you a happy belated Valentine's

2083
02:15:01,500 --> 02:15:06,220
Day and say goodbye. You're still in time here in the US. It's 8.30 and it's still Valentine's

2084
02:15:06,220 --> 02:15:10,780
Day here. So thank you very much for the call. It's almost 6 a.m. here. Thank you for staying

2085
02:15:10,780 --> 02:15:15,260
up late. It means a lot. No worries. All right. Have a good one, buddy. Same. Night.

2086
02:15:15,260 --> 02:15:18,940
I love first time callers. And you know what? I think that's the perfect way to end the

2087
02:15:18,940 --> 02:15:21,820
Skypline tonight. So I'm sorry to those guys that didn't get through tonight. Remember,

2088
02:15:21,820 --> 02:15:24,940
you still can't send us tweets. You can send us emails. There are tons of other ways to

2089
02:15:24,940 --> 02:15:29,020
interact with the show. Um, but I think let's, let's end it on a first time caller tonight.

2090
02:15:29,020 --> 02:15:33,260
That was, that was a good note to end on and a good topic. Very good topic. Kind of. It's,

2091
02:15:33,260 --> 02:15:37,740
it's interesting how those two calls related tonight, isn't it? Anyhow. A last minute stories

2092
02:15:37,740 --> 02:15:43,340
Loki. I know you've got to have some last minute stories over there. Nope. No, no. I just wasn't

2093
02:15:43,340 --> 02:15:50,620
paying attention. Jerk. No, it's, um, I'm sure we've got something, but I just have to look it up.

2094
02:15:53,340 --> 02:15:56,940
Well, I, at dark soccer, do you have any last minute stories for the night? I don't know.

2095
02:15:56,940 --> 02:16:02,460
I'm almost done with this hat. All right. Just quick programming note next week. Um,

2096
02:16:02,460 --> 02:16:06,460
we are still planning on having a show next week, but I just want to warn folks if things get

2097
02:16:06,460 --> 02:16:10,780
delayed or something weird happens, it could happen. Just, this is live really not so much

2098
02:16:10,780 --> 02:16:15,820
podcast. Um, I'm moving next week. Now I have movers that are supposed to be able to do it all

2099
02:16:15,820 --> 02:16:22,060
in the morning, but just if weird stuff happens. Yeah. The podcast could also be delayed a little

2100
02:16:22,060 --> 02:16:26,300
bit next week because I may not have internet at my new place right away. Uh, but if horse comes

2101
02:16:26,300 --> 02:16:30,300
towards, I'll just come over here to Casa to Jamie and take care of things over here. I'm

2102
02:16:30,300 --> 02:16:35,020
sure she won't mind. We'll make hats together and upload podcasts. It'll be fun. I'll teach you how

2103
02:16:35,020 --> 02:16:39,980
to crochet. I, it might be fun. Probably be more productive than a lot of the things I

2104
02:16:39,980 --> 02:16:44,060
stay at home and do like world of Warcraft and stuff. All right, Loki, got any last minute

2105
02:16:44,060 --> 02:16:48,860
stories for us? Yeah, we'll just cover a few things here. Um, Sam and Max, the devil's playground

2106
02:16:48,860 --> 02:16:54,940
has been revealed by the OFLC. Um, of course, you know, that leaked out when it got raided

2107
02:16:54,940 --> 02:17:02,060
and, uh, the episode, uh, one of that series, uh, will now be entitled the penal zone. So, uh,

2108
02:17:02,060 --> 02:17:10,940
that's scheduled to be coming out, um, later on, probably this year. Uh, let's see here. Um,

2109
02:17:12,300 --> 02:17:19,420
Holy invasion of privacy. Bad man is unfortunately, um, gonna have to change his name after a, uh,

2110
02:17:19,420 --> 02:17:27,980
conflict with an existing IP. In other words, Batman. Um, so now it has been changed to,

2111
02:17:27,980 --> 02:17:34,140
what did I do? Oh, what did I do to deserve this? My Lord. And of course, uh, the sequel will be

2112
02:17:34,140 --> 02:17:41,100
coming out very soon and we'll include the original as well. Um, Square Enix has trademarked

2113
02:17:41,100 --> 02:17:47,340
deuce X human revolution, possibly meaning that they're going to be doing a new game in that

2114
02:17:47,340 --> 02:17:51,260
series. And it's been a while. It's weird to hear that Squeenix is doing that, but I have to

2115
02:17:51,260 --> 02:17:57,900
remember they absorbed IDOS. So this is a little weird for me, but okay. Um, and then of course,

2116
02:17:57,900 --> 02:18:05,980
uh, those of you who bought Darksiders, um, early enough received a, um, card with a code on it and

2117
02:18:05,980 --> 02:18:11,820
the instructions of do not discard this card and you'll want to save this code. It has been

2118
02:18:11,820 --> 02:18:16,860
revealed though that that code will entitle you to a free copy of Red Faction Guerrilla for

2119
02:18:16,860 --> 02:18:23,660
PlayStation three or Xbox 360. And it's, um, the offer will be available until the end of,

2120
02:18:23,660 --> 02:18:32,300
uh, March 7th. And apparently, um, no word on exactly when you'll receive those copies. Um,

2121
02:18:32,300 --> 02:18:37,820
you will have to pay $5 for shipping, however, but, um, still though Red Faction Guerrilla is

2122
02:18:37,820 --> 02:18:42,220
a pretty awesome game and, uh, no word if they're still printing those cards and if they're

2123
02:18:42,220 --> 02:18:49,340
included in, um, copies of the game as of right now. And that's about it.

2124
02:18:49,340 --> 02:18:55,820
All right, well, that's gonna kind of start to wrap up another edition here.

2125
02:18:55,820 --> 02:19:00,300
Oh, I saw something else that was kind of funny real quick, but I have, no, I didn't, I didn't

2126
02:19:00,300 --> 02:19:05,020
see a link to it or anything, but apparently someone's developed an emulator for the NES.

2127
02:19:05,020 --> 02:19:11,660
Right now it doesn't have, um, any, uh, audio in it yet, but they programmed it all in the

2128
02:19:11,660 --> 02:19:17,340
Blu-ray, the, uh, what is it? Blu-ray Java. So it will actually be able to run on PlayStation

2129
02:19:17,340 --> 02:19:22,060
3s without modification using, using just a flash drive.

2130
02:19:23,580 --> 02:19:25,260
That's the NES emulator?

2131
02:19:25,260 --> 02:19:25,500
Yeah.

2132
02:19:25,500 --> 02:19:26,460
Is this out yet?

2133
02:19:26,460 --> 02:19:31,180
Um, apparently it is. I didn't see a link to where it was at though, but, um, it doesn't run,

2134
02:19:31,180 --> 02:19:34,460
like I said, with, um, sound yet, but it does run.

2135
02:19:34,460 --> 02:19:37,980
Yeah, it's only a matter of time then before they get the sound and everything.

2136
02:19:37,980 --> 02:19:41,420
But that's pretty awesome though that they're able to program that and no modification.

2137
02:19:41,980 --> 02:19:45,420
Hopefully it plays smoothly because the PlayStation controller is a sweet controller.

2138
02:19:45,420 --> 02:19:47,340
I would love to play NES games with that.

2139
02:19:47,340 --> 02:19:47,980
Yeah.

2140
02:19:47,980 --> 02:19:50,300
Ones that I own the cartridge for legitimately, of course.

2141
02:19:50,300 --> 02:19:51,900
Of course. That's it.

2142
02:19:52,540 --> 02:19:56,940
All right. Well, that's going to do it for another edition here of Orange Lounge Radio,

2143
02:19:56,940 --> 02:20:00,460
but, uh, before we wrap things up, we've got to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2144
02:20:00,460 --> 02:20:02,780
So, uh, DarkSakura, do you have any final thoughts for us tonight?

2145
02:20:03,420 --> 02:20:04,060
I have one.

2146
02:20:04,860 --> 02:20:05,340
What's that?

2147
02:20:05,340 --> 02:20:21,500
I need to play more Borderlands.

2148
02:20:22,540 --> 02:20:26,620
My final thought is I'm getting hungry again. Um, I had a very,

2149
02:20:26,620 --> 02:20:29,340
I had a very lovely breakfast made for me this morning. That was very filling,

2150
02:20:29,340 --> 02:20:30,780
but now, you know, that was, that was a while ago.

2151
02:20:30,780 --> 02:20:33,180
So now I'm getting to the point where I'm like, Ooh, tacos.

2152
02:20:33,180 --> 02:20:35,340
We'll see.

2153
