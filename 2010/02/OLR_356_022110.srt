Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Here's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Lowkey

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, February 21st, 2010, Nintendo hits Australian piracy again,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
EA is going to shut down more servers, and a recent HD fighting game is being ported to the iPhone.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hello my friends on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio,

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
the video game podcast where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We are live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Thanks to the folks at All Games Radio for letting us steal their bandwidth

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
every week right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, live on Sunday nights.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
With me is always say hello to my one and only co-host, DarkSakura.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
One and only?

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Well, you know, one and only sidekick.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I don't know, because I always introduce Lowkey as tech master Lowkey.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
He's still a co-host, but that's just the way it is.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You made him spit out his chicken.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm sorry. Lowkey knows I love him.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Not in a, you know, no homo.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Isn't that what the rappers say now?

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I think I was seeing something the other day where, I don't know, some rappers were talking about,

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
you know, yeah, yeah, you look really good in that outfit. No homo.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Although I am a homo if you haven't already heard, so whatever.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This show's off to a very strange start already tonight.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's not just the bandwidth issues, is it?

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yeah.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So anyway, how you doing, DarkSakura?

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm doing.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
All right.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And of course, the one and only tech master Lowkey is here as well.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Hello.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
How you doing, Lowkey?

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Good.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
All right.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So we're gonna be talking video games, of course, over the next few hours with you guys

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
at our chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And I want to apologize in advance.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Live radio tonight, I don't know what's going on.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We're having some bandwidth issues in all games, and I think it's kind of why we're off.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's not all games' fault, though.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
They're perfect, because Bobby had a flawless show.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
But it's something to do, I think, with Comcast somewhere.

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So we're actually starting at 6.15 tonight to give you an idea of how many internet issues we have.

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But that's the joy of doing live radio.

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I gotta say, there's not a lot of podcasts out there that do it live.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You know, obviously there are several.

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But there's not a lot that do the phone calls and all that other stuff.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And that's just part of the fun of it.

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You know, I think it's the best way to make sure that every gamer has a voice.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So you have to take the bad with the good, and sometimes there's gonna be bandwidth issues.

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
All right.

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So we also have a special guest here in the studio tonight.

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And it's not often we get guests at Studio Dark Sakura, besides Shermy, of course.

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But sometimes you have Dan, and I know Tiara's been here before as well.

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But tonight we have another special guest.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Say hello, everybody, to Salacious Pop.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Hello.

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
How are you?

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm good. How are you?

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Good.

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Now, it's funny that I was talking about No Homo earlier, because Salacious Pop happens

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
to be my boyfriend.

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's right.

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I brought my boyfriend to the show tonight.

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So how are you?

66
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm great.

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yes.

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So tell the listeners a little bit about yourself and video games, like what you're into.

69
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Like, what kind of video games do you play?

70
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Without telling us about your gaming week, what would you say would be your favorite

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
video game and the types of stuff you're into?

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Music and rhythm games, RPGs, and adventure games.

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yeah?

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And what would you say is, like, your favorite video game ever?

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Valkyrie Profile.

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yeah?

77
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Why?

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The art direction, the story, the multiple endings, and the music.

79
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Gotcha.

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What was, like, kind of, how did you get into video games?

81
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Did you get into video games when you were, like, older?

82
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Or was it something you've, like, had a controller in your hand since you were born?

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Or what?

84
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I think I got an Atari 2600 when I was about six or seven years old.

85
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And from there I graduated up to the NES and Super NES and played all these Sierra Online

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
games and that was it.

87
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Very cool.

88
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And, of course, the chat room's chiming in here.

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Leachum6 in chat says, does that mean plus homo?

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I guess.

91
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I don't know.

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Whatever.

93
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
We're just, you know what, we like video games.

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
That's the important thing here.

95
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So, yeah, we're going to talk about video games over the next few hours and the latest

96
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
that's going on in video games and news and everything.

97
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I don't know what it is.

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Tonight is just an off night.

99
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I don't know if it's, like, the bandwidth or what, but I just feel kind of off and it

100
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
has nothing to do with Alan being here.

101
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Or maybe I'm cracking under the pressure.

102
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I don't know.

103
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Is it different being here?

104
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Because you've listened to the show before, obviously, right?

105
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You've commented in chat.

106
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Is it different being here in studio than it is listening?

107
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Absolutely.

108
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
How is it different?

109
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Because I'm on live radio.

110
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Because you're on live radio?

111
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Because you get in the middle of the chicken.

112
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And I'm nervous.

113
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You're nervous?

114
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Don't be nervous.

115
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's fine.

116
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
We've gotten away with this crap for some reason.

117
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Dan's in the other room.

118
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm nervous.

119
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yeah.

120
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
All right.

121
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Well, don't be nervous.

122
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And even Loki.

123
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Loki seems a little off tonight, too.

124
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What's going on, Loki?

125
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Because I asked Loki a question earlier.

126
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
He has malaria.

127
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
He got a little bitchy with me.

128
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Loki's not usually the bitchy one.

129
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Dark soccer.

130
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
She's the bitchy one.

131
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Loki.

132
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I didn't get bitchy.

133
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I was joking.

134
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You were a little bitchy.

135
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I was joking.

136
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Oh, okay.

137
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah, that's what I tell Dan once a month.

138
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
She's like, well, someone didn't give me the stories that I put in there.

139
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm like, well, that's too bad.

140
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But here's the thing.

141
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Here's the thing.

142
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It was funny.

143
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Here's the thing the listeners have to know.

144
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Loki, although I know he kind of gets branded as the angry one on the show, because he does

145
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
his little rants when it's appropriate.

146
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And he's the angry guy on the show.

147
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
He's actually, if you meet him in real life, he's one of the nicest people you'll ever

148
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
meet.

149
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Seriously.

150
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I really mean that.

151
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Loki goes out of his way to help people.

152
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,320
He's that guy you can call when your computer's broken or that tech guy everybody knows that

153
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,320
you can call, right?

154
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,320
I'm the angry one.

155
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,320
Yeah.

156
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,320
And Jamie's usually the angry one.

157
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:40,240
But tonight is weird because Loki was kind of like, well, I don't know, too bad.

158
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,080
And then Jamie's like, I'm going to knit the listeners a sweater.

159
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:50,040
Well, no, it was just like she wanted to put stories in and I forgot to put them in there.

160
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,960
And I'm like, well, I can't do anything about it now.

161
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,960
It's no big deal.

162
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,960
I don't think anyone cares.

163
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,960
I was trying to be funny.

164
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,960
But it's just funny.

165
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,960
I wasn't like, damn you woman.

166
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,960
Why are you complaining?

167
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,960
I was never like that.

168
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,080
How can I be mad?

169
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,080
I have chicken.

170
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,080
No.

171
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,080
How can anybody be mad?

172
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,360
And Rob brought churro chips.

173
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
That's right.

174
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,360
These delicious.

175
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,360
I'm going to endorse these.

176
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,360
They don't pay me, but these chips are delicious.

177
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,080
I think I would like another couple of them, please.

178
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,600
They're Stacy's cinnamon sugar pita chips and they're delicious.

179
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,040
And I bought them at Walgreens.

180
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,040
No, wait, wait, wait.

181
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,040
Get back in here.

182
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,040
Wait, is a Dan approaches?

183
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,040
Put your butt back in here.

184
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,040
Throw the pester ball at Dan.

185
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,040
See if he can catch his attention.

186
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
Pester, pester.

187
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,040
Baller, baller, baller, baller, baller, baller.

188
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,040
I guess he didn't want to come in.

189
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,040
All right.

190
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:35,360
Anyhow, when he hears us saying something that he doesn't agree with, he'll pop in and

191
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,360
let us know.

192
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,360
All right, let's start off.

193
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,360
You can know he's going to stick his head and go, bitches.

194
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,360
All right.

195
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,360
Dan was just trying to say hi to Alan.

196
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,360
All right.

197
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,920
Let's go around and see how everybody's gaming week was.

198
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,480
Usually we start the show with a little bit of how is your gaming week, but tonight we're

199
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,480
broken.

200
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,560
If it's your first time listening, I'm sorry.

201
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,080
If it's your 50th time listening, I'm sorry.

202
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,480
All right, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

203
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,120
It was a lot of Star Trek online because I have a new graphics card, or really I have

204
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,080
someone else's old graphics card, but it's new to me.

205
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,880
In fact, the box of it is sitting right behind you.

206
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,880
It's a-

207
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,880
Indeed.

208
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:25,000
Oh, it's a GeForce 9800 GTX Plus Black Edition with bells and whistles and crack falling

209
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
out of it.

210
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,840
Have you ever clocked it yet?

211
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,840
No.

212
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,840
You should.

213
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,240
We'll see.

214
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,920
Because it's easy and it's extra juice.

215
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,920
We'll see.

216
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,920
Okay.

217
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,960
Why don't you ever clock the card, woman?

218
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,320
Don't you know what you're doing?

219
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,320
Well-

220
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,320
I couldn't-

221
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,320
I've had it.

222
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,800
It went in on Wednesday.

223
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,720
Since then, I've had a friend in the hospital.

224
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
I've had homework.

225
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,720
I've had a meeting-

226
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,720
Is your friend okay?

227
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
Is this someone I know?

228
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,720
Are they okay?

229
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,720
I don't think he-

230
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,360
I haven't met him.

231
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:07,440
One of my friends from Temple, he went in with something with his heart.

232
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,200
I'll tell you more offline.

233
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,280
So I went to see him at the hospital, and I've been trying to play Star Trek online

234
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,560
today, but my internet's been kind of-

235
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,920
Every time I would pick a system to go to, it would-

236
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:29,960
Okay, you know on Ragnarok Online, when you would have a hiccup, and your character would

237
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,920
just suddenly back up a bajillion miles back from wherever you were before?

238
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,240
I understand, but I'll bet you maybe 1% of the listenership understands.

239
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,720
Well, it'd be like, my ship would hiccup, it would backtrack, so you'd actually see

240
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,360
the trails going backwards ahead of the ship, and it would change direction.

241
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,280
And I'm like, what the hell?

242
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:57,200
So basically your computer was telling you, I can't keep it moving, I don't have the power!

243
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,640
It wasn't even letting- giving me any option to enter the system when I was manually controlling

244
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,640
it to go there.

245
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,080
I was like, well crap, I can't, you know, level, but I started my Klingon the other

246
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,160
night, and that was pretty cool.

247
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,600
I have Klingon now.

248
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
So the system was down.

249
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,240
The system is down, dude.

250
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,640
The system is down.

251
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,640
Okay.

252
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,000
I was also playing little clone games on my Linux box.

253
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,920
I was playing, I think it was called like, Penguin Freeze or something, and it's best

254
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,060
to move with penguins.

255
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:34,000
And they had Connect Four, and I was playing Minesweeper, and the little, you know, just-

256
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,120
Is socially awkward penguin in the game?

257
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,280
I guess.

258
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:45,440
And then, I was playing Puzzle Bobble in Flash, which is pretty fun.

259
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,360
And that's about it, yeah.

260
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,360
Alright.

261
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,680
And I slept.

262
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,680
Techmaster Loki.

263
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,680
How was your gaming week?

264
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,020
Actually, before I get to that, I should say, some of the people in chat are commenting

265
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:02,160
on the exchange earlier about the Switching Personalities night.

266
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,040
Sj100matt, go USA in chat.

267
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,360
That's right, it's Olympics time.

268
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,640
Sj100matt says, Loki missed posting stories, but at least he has chicken.

269
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,560
Loki Jenkins.

270
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,160
I just wanted honey barbecue chicken.

271
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,160
Every now and then I get the craving for it.

272
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,760
There's nothing wrong with chicken.

273
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,280
You know, I kind of have a cold right now, so it was the only thing that sounded good.

274
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,840
Chicken and vitamin C. Orange chicken.

275
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,840
Yeah.

276
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,840
Orange chicken, yeah.

277
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,120
There you go.

278
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,760
Let's see, this week, didn't play a whole lot of stuff.

279
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:43,000
I did put in a good five hours worth of Borderlands though yesterday, so that was fun.

280
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,480
Started doing Mad Moxie's Underdome Riot, and it's very tedious.

281
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,160
Although I did play one round with a friend earlier in the week during lunch, and it was

282
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,280
actually pretty fun co-op, but single player, man, it's pretty boring.

283
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:04,680
But it was cool, so I played that a little bit, and I'm just kind of working through

284
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,680
Borderlands still.

285
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,560
It's still very fun, and can't wait for the next expansion to come out.

286
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,560
That would be pretty cool.

287
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,880
Although, what a weird level cap though.

288
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,200
They capped it at 61 in the new expansion.

289
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,200
Huh.

290
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,600
I mean, it's like, okay.

291
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,400
Well, maybe there's going to be four more expansions, so it'll be 62, and then 63.

292
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,400
Who knows?

293
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:31,160
It's still dumb, but 61, okay, that's what you want to stop at, fine with me.

294
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,680
And then, of course, more Grand Theft Auto.

295
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:47,240
In fact, actually, I want to say that I'm in the top 200 now for cumulative.

296
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,840
I'm not really sure about that, but I know for a fact though, I'm in like the mid 70s

297
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:59,600
now for true skill rankings, so I'm in the top 75 players in the world, so that's pretty

298
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,600
awesome.

299
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,400
And if one of our listeners wants to serve you a slice of humble pie, how can they do

300
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
that?

301
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,400
Just find me online.

302
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:12,360
We play just ranked games now, so if you happen to be playing a ranked game around 10, 1030-ish,

303
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:18,560
you know, 3, 330, and then sometime between noon and one, depending on if we're playing

304
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,720
during lunch, you should be able to find us, because there's no one on there.

305
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,080
So it's pretty easy.

306
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:31,640
We have four systems and we're able to get into ranked games together easy, so...

307
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,600
We're looking for people to play because everybody keeps dropping one when they play with us

308
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,640
because they get pissed off that we kick the crap out of them.

309
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,080
And not that we do it on purpose, I kick the crap out of everybody, including my coworkers,

310
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,740
and they get pissed off too, but, you know.

311
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,740
I don't know.

312
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,520
QQ more.

313
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,040
They make fun of me, they're like, what?

314
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,800
And they'll get ahead or something and they'll be just like, aww, you're just sucking it

315
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:01,200
up today, blah, blah, blah, I'm like, alright, now I gotta kill you.

316
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,120
See how they go and do that, and now you're just gonna learn the lesson that's involved

317
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,960
with, you know, criticizing my playing.

318
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,280
And that is death.

319
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,560
Lots and lots of death.

320
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,560
In very humiliating ways.

321
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,120
So yeah.

322
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,120
Alright.

323
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,760
My gaming week, not a whole lot to report on.

324
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,000
I moved this week, though, I have a really good excuse.

325
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,120
I have a new place that I'm living at, and I'm still without internet, so not even a

326
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,280
lot of wow this weekend, it's kinda sad.

327
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,960
But I did play a little bit of wow, of course, earlier in the week, I mean, come on, it's

328
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,160
me we're talking about.

329
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,120
I was playing that right up until they unplugged the internet.

330
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,360
And then after that, probably my other big gaming thing was that I actually went to Roseville

331
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,160
Golf Lamb this week, the great place where video games go to die.

332
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,880
Although I have to say, the games I was interested in playing were all working fine, and I did

333
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,400
play lots and lots of BeatMania Distorted, and I was playing the old school songs in

334
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
Distorted.

335
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,760
But I know Alan tried playing, like, King of Fighters, or something, what was wrong?

336
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,160
You were playing, what, King of Fighters 98 or something, what were you playing there?

337
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,160
Yeah, it was King of Fighters 2003.

338
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:13,720
And the first player side had a button missing, and the second player side couldn't move left.

339
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,160
Or forward when you're second player.

340
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,000
So that was a great time.

341
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,760
So it's so easy to fix, too, though.

342
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,000
Imagine trying to play a fighting game without moving forward.

343
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,440
You know, this means photo time again.

344
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:31,720
But I gotta say, the 2DX machine worked fine, and all the music games actually seemed to

345
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,840
be in really good shape.

346
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,840
You were playing DJ Max Technica.

347
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,240
Yeah, that was working fine, right?

348
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,320
I'm gonna give you an example of how long it's been since I've been there.

349
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:45,240
They didn't have the 2DX machine set up the last time I was there.

350
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,240
You know what?

351
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,160
Not a lot's changed, I gotta be honest.

352
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,880
It's a lot of ticket redemption machines still, and this is really true of any arcade I could

353
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,880
probably mention.

354
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
It's mostly ticket redemption machines.

355
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,880
It's a safe bet.

356
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,880
Yeah.

357
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,960
I did play a little bit, Alan and I sparred on Mario Kart, and it's nothing like Mario

358
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,960
Kart, the home version.

359
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:06,680
You know, I've been wanting to play the second one, because they have a second GPRK, but

360
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,080
yeah, the GPRK ones are kind of boring, actually.

361
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,360
But hey, port them in the home systems.

362
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,360
Make them playable online.

363
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,360
Oh, wait.

364
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,360
I'm asking too much.

365
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,960
All right, so that was pretty much my gaming week.

366
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,560
Not a lot of exciting stuff, because, you know, without me moving right now, hopefully

367
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,560
I'll have more next week.

368
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,840
I know I will in two weeks, when Final Fantasy XIII's out, so just wait.

369
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,840
Alan, how was your-

370
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,400
It's only two weeks away.

371
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,400
I know.

372
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,400
It's exciting.

373
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,400
It is exciting.

374
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,400
I'm so excited.

375
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,400
All right, Alan, how was your gaming week?

376
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,400
What'd you play?

377
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:39,200
I played a lot of WoW, because for some reason, you know, someone got me into that.

378
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,120
I don't know who, but yeah, so lots of WoW.

379
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,480
Logged into my City of Heroes characters.

380
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,240
I still play that.

381
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,000
The next expansion, Going Rogue, is actually due out in July.

382
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,920
So I just logged in to, you know, get- refamiliarized myself with my characters.

383
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,240
Played some Gyromancer, the DLC, the extra hard maps.

384
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,240
Now that it works.

385
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,000
Yes, now that it works.

386
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,840
And a Valkyrie profile DS is really what I'm playing right now.

387
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,840
Very cool.

388
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,840
City of Heroes, real quick, because it's not a game we've talked a lot about on the show.

389
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,000
I think we've all kind of, like, dabbled in it a little bit.

390
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,440
I've got the architect addition in my closet.

391
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,720
Like, I know you kind of played it, like, a little bit, but not, like, extensively,

392
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,720
right?

393
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,040
What does City of Heroes have, because you're obviously still playing it while you're juggling

394
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,040
WoW.

395
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,600
What does City of Heroes have for you in an MMO that WoW is lacking?

396
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:41,040
The ability to come up with a very strong character concept, and the costume designer

397
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,360
is so powerful that you can pretty much have a completely unique character.

398
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,360
Oh, I love that.

399
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,600
I downloaded that little Korean client that you could just play with all day and not have

400
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
to even have an account.

401
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,840
That was so much fun.

402
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,920
And I did notice that when you were showing me your thing, like, how you could, like,

403
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,200
go in a phone booth and you'd have, like, the different costumes.

404
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,420
You could save, like, five different costume presets.

405
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:06,640
It didn't seem to affect your abilities at all whatsoever, at least that I noticed.

406
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,640
I don't know.

407
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,640
Maybe it did.

408
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,880
And then, like, you had a little bio written on your character, and you'd actually kind

409
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,280
of written a whole little thing, and I was thinking, this is like an RP type of player's

410
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,280
dream.

411
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,080
City of Heroes has an amazing RP community, and I think that's...

412
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:23,160
It's almost a six-year-old game, and for them to be releasing a major expansion six years

413
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,000
after the fact, there has to be the money there in the subscriptions, and it's mostly

414
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,680
the RP-ers that are sticking around.

415
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,680
Six...

416
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,760
And WoW's probably been around about five, six years.

417
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,320
Well, it just had its fifth anniversary, so it's been around about as long, yeah.

418
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,880
Yeah, City of Heroes was huge for the first six or seven months, and then when WoW came

419
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:49,160
out, there was sort of a big vacuum, but it's server population's kind of low, but yeah,

420
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,160
there's still a community.

421
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,160
Well, a lot of MMOs like that.

422
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,840
I mean, Final Fantasy XI, you know, it took a little hit when WoW came out, but I think

423
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,200
the audiences for those two games are very different, but I just, I know because I was

424
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,040
playing Final Fantasy XI and kind of went back and forth for a little while between

425
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,920
that and WoW when it first came out, but there's definitely, you know, there's always gonna

426
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,760
be those diehards that just love the game, and I think especially when you bring that

427
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,960
RP component into it, you know, I don't know, I mean, Final Fantasy XI had somewhat, you

428
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,400
could do, I mean, you could do the RP with any game, but I could see where City of Heroes

429
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,280
really let you embrace that, you know.

430
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,280
Final Fantasy XI, if you think WoW's limited with how your character can look, Final Fantasy

431
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,400
XI's really limiting too, so...

432
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:30,840
Well, I have to say that, you know, the moment I moved on to Star Trek Online, I forgot about

433
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,280
World of Warcraft, really, I did.

434
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,360
What is it, okay, then let me ask you the same question I asked Alan, what is it about

435
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,120
Star Trek Online that had it for you that WoW didn't, or is it just, I know you love

436
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,080
Star Trek, is it just the fandom, period?

437
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,720
It's really not just the fandom, it's the fact that I really can play by myself, you

438
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,900
know, I don't have to, it's annoying as fuck to party with people, really.

439
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,480
It's annoying, it pisses me off, I hate doing it.

440
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,200
You know, even when it's one of my friends, after like an hour of following behind somebody,

441
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,880
I'm like, okay, I'm tired of this, this is monotonous.

442
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,400
Whereas in Star Trek Online, it's like when you are doing your instances, you go into

443
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,020
an area and you may have three people already there, complete strangers, and you can run

444
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:16,060
through your series of instances together, when you're done with it, that's it.

445
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,160
You don't have to really hang out with them, you don't have to follow them around, you

446
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,040
can do your own thing.

447
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:26,000
Like I had one person go into one instance, and I went to a completely different one,

448
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,680
and we all got, you know, the points for it, because it was still, we were working together.

449
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:37,000
And that's what I like, is it's sort of, it's teamwork, but you can choose if you want to

450
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:44,420
do a fleet mission, and it feels like an episode, it's got enough random in it that it really

451
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,860
keeps my interest in it.

452
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:49,680
I will just quickly say this in WoW's defense, is that since you left, they did roll out

453
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,440
the Looking for Dungeon tool, which has really helped with a lot of the instancing in that

454
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,440
game.

455
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,440
That was the one while I was playing it.

456
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,440
Oh was it?

457
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,440
Yeah.

458
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,440
Oh wow.

459
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,440
And now they're going to be rolling out, and I don't think it's in our show world this

460
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,600
week, I apologize if I'm bumping a story, but Looking for PvP is coming out as well

461
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
very soon.

462
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,600
Nope, you're not.

463
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
I hate PvP.

464
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:11,880
You know, but I gotta admit, from a WoW standpoint, you know, I realize not everybody's into it,

465
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,540
which is cool, but for me, why I like WoW is that it is such a robust game.

466
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,800
You know, I can just log in, it's like, oh, I'm gonna just go slip right into a dungeon,

467
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,920
or, you know, nobody else is online, maybe I'll go PvP by myself, or hey, Alan's online,

468
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,440
we're gonna go quest together, and it's like we're hanging out, but we're not, because

469
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,440
we're nerds.

470
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:31,240
I totally don't mind, though, doing PvP, though, if I get to smash some Klingons in the face.

471
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,760
I just can't wait until we get Romulan and Cardassian missions.

472
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,880
Is that like a future expansion?

473
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,440
Yeah, I think that's gonna be a future thing.

474
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:45,280
I will play some more Star Trek online, but see, there's this big thing kind of hovering

475
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:51,600
in the distance, and that is Final Fantasy XIV, and I just know, like, I have to play

476
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,600
it.

477
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,600
I have to, I've sucked three years, I mean, if you guys think I talk about WoW a lot,

478
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,480
you should have been on the show three, four years ago, like, do you remember when we used

479
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,200
to talk about the fairy server?

480
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,080
I mean, that's old school, okay?

481
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,080
I used to play with you.

482
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,300
I don't, we used to talk, I mean, I used to just talk about Final Fantasy XI all the

483
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:13,780
freaking time on the show, so, I mean, I have to try XIV, just because I sunk so much time

484
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,780
into XI.

485
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:18,980
I mean, I gave XI a really good try, I mean, you were here watching me play, doing the

486
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,640
freaking macros on my controller.

487
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,440
But if you hate grouping with people, XI stinks.

488
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,440
It does.

489
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,600
I mean, XI is about forced, the enemy?

490
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,600
It is forced grouping.

491
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,120
To be fair, they fixed a lot of that, like, years later, like, after I left with the level

492
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,160
sink and everything, but, you know.

493
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,800
Well, you know, my big problem with that one is just that, you know, maybe it was just

494
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,500
because I was playing the White Mage, maybe it was because I was the party bitch.

495
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:48,800
You know, it finally, and I've told the story before, the final straw for that game was

496
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:53,040
me calling everybody over with my little dinky, okay, I will go back, actually, playing with

497
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,360
Japanese players is not annoying.

498
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,360
They know how to party.

499
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,360
If you know what I mean.

500
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,880
They're the only ones that would respect a bard.

501
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,400
That's right, I remember when you tried to play a bard.

502
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:08,940
Dude, I was a pimp-ass bard, but, you know, just no one wanted to play the bard, I rocked

503
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,940
the bard.

504
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:17,860
And if you would, see, here's your proof, angry Loki, when you talk about, you know,

505
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:21,040
some of the hacking and the stuff, he gets angry Loki.

506
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,180
I rocked the bard.

507
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,240
But then, what angry man says that?

508
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,900
But remember, you can also swap out the music and stuff in there, because there was that

509
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:34,680
little trick you could do, and so I would have, like, smack my bitch up to, like, the

510
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,680
battle music.

511
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,680
It was awesome.

512
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,160
Dude, I remember when you would mount up on the chocobo, and it would play the theme from

513
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,760
the Neverending Story.

514
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,760
Oh, yeah?

515
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,600
Oh, yes.

516
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,120
Oh, that's fun.

517
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,800
Well, what my story was, as I was saying.

518
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,800
Sorry.

519
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,800
It's okay.

520
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,800
No, I think that's funny.

521
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,800
It was worth it.

522
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,800
Smack my bitch up.

523
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,600
Anyway, so my little character, you know, because when you throw out your macros, you

524
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,160
can call everyone in your party to come back to you so that you can do an area effect buff.

525
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:09,840
And I was finally, like, I did the buff, everything, then this one guy comes in, hey, I'm in the

526
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,840
buff.

527
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,840
I'm like, fuck you, log out.

528
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,840
And that was it.

529
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,840
I never played again.

530
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,840
All right.

531
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:22,960
I totally remember, I totally forgot about Falkor's Ride or whatever it said to the chocobo,

532
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,000
but it was awesome.

533
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,020
It was very epic.

534
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,840
This was when Loki and I lived together, and, like, we had our computers, like, kind of,

535
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,840
like, right next to each other, like, they're here in the studio.

536
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,040
So, you know, I'd be doing my thing in Final Fantasy XI, and then, like, I'm like, okay,

537
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,260
because, you know, Loki and I would play together sometimes because we're nerds, right?

538
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:42,200
And I'd say, like, okay, Loki, come meet me in Altepa Desert and let's party.

539
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,160
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

540
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,400
And, like, Loki's fanfare is, like, coming from the computer.

541
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,400
And then I'll say...

542
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,400
Bring your harp.

543
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,400
No, then I'll...

544
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,600
I did that, though, with Ragnarok for a little while, because it's all MP3s, so you could

545
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,600
change out the music.

546
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,600
So, I remember going into...

547
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:07,400
It was this one place that used to have this big, epic music, and it was, like, instead

548
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,160
it was a bassoon quartet.

549
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,160
There was another one.

550
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,320
The group party music that I had was...

551
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,120
The battle music was the theme...

552
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,800
It wasn't the theme of Zanarkand or whatever, but it's from Final Fantasy XI.

553
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,960
It was the jacked, angry music.

554
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,960
I remember that.

555
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,960
Otherworld.

556
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,960
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

557
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,960
Otherworld.

558
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,960
It was awesome.

559
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,560
And Final Fantasy X, I remember it from your frickin', like, every time.

560
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:35,320
Because I was a healer, so I never really engaged the monster, but, like, you know,

561
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,320
when you...

562
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,720
I think you finally started Black Mage instead of Bard, and, you know, we'd be fighting,

563
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:45,920
you know, the killer level 60 rabbit or whatever, and then, like, okay, engage the rabbit.

564
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,920
Doo doo doo doo doo doo.

565
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,440
Like you just had the most epic bunny killing music I've ever heard in my life.

566
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:55,080
I just hope that's the only thing that they include from Final Fantasy XI in XIV, is the

567
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,320
ability to change the music out.

568
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,040
You're not supposed to be able to do that.

569
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,040
You just like to hack things.

570
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,040
Oh, who cares?

571
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,040
Yes.

572
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,040
All right.

573
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,560
Anyhow, boy, we're not even, like, into the gaming news yet.

574
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,560
Hey.

575
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,560
You know what?

576
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,120
If I was gonna do that, then my battle music would be bitches.

577
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,240
I mean, mindless self-indulgence.

578
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,400
I don't know what mine would be.

579
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,920
What would be some good battle music for me, Alan?

580
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,920
I'm trying to think.

581
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,720
For Final Fantasy XIV, if I could hack the music.

582
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,720
What are you guys talking about?

583
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,800
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

584
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,800
Anyhow.

585
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:31,680
Actually, Shaoran in the chat room, I hope I pronounced that right, chat.orange.radio.com

586
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:36,000
says, has a suggestion, if Star Trek Online had a customizable music, OLR would need to

587
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,760
bring in, I'm on a boat.

588
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:44,720
I would totally do that for the, you know how they have the fairies you could take?

589
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,520
Oh yeah, I remember the first time taking a fairy in Final Fantasy XI.

590
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,720
Like I got on the little fairy, cause like, you know, getting around in Final Fantasy

591
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,720
XI kind of sucks.

592
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,080
It takes like 30 minutes to get from one thing to the other.

593
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,080
So you'd get on the boat.

594
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,480
I remember the first time I ever took a boat ride, you know, it's like, doo doo doo doo

595
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,480
doo doo doo doo doo.

596
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,480
You know, happy little boat music.

597
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,840
And then all of a sudden it gets really dark, doo doo doo doo doo.

598
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,640
We fricking got raided by pirates the first time I ever rode a boat in the game.

599
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,240
And now, but I, I remember that being an epic moment of Final Fantasy XI.

600
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,060
I was like, that was actually really cool that the boats will randomly get raided by

601
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,060
pirates.

602
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:22,000
And like, I would, you would have to, as a low level character, literally run and hide

603
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
in the basement.

604
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,800
I think I had to, cause you like, you came and got me one time.

605
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,640
Well, someone dragged a Kraken down the stairs.

606
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:36,560
Anyhow, I have to say though, I still, to this day, remember the look on your face when

607
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,600
I was doing my macros on my controller.

608
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,120
I was very impressed with the way you were doing the, but, but then I couldn't, that's

609
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,120
what I hated in World of Warcraft.

610
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,840
I couldn't use my damn controller.

611
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:49,280
Final Fantasy XI was built for the PS2, you know, and I have to remember losing controller.

612
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,120
That's the way most of the Japanese players do it now.

613
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,000
And some American ones as well, obviously, but I cannot imagine that game without a computer

614
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
keyboard.

615
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Anyway.

616
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I agree with Rama.

617
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,200
When did this become Final Fantasy Radio?

618
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,200
I don't know.

619
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,200
So let's move on.

620
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,720
Let's get into some housekeeping tonight and talk a little bit about what's going on with

621
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,600
OLR before we get into the gaming news tonight.

622
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,020
I don't have a whole lot of show specific news besides, don't forget that you can always

623
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,000
join us on our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

624
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,840
And of course we're on Facebook as well.

625
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,720
Orange Lounge Radio there, Addis is your friend and we will usually make updates except tonight

626
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,920
because with all the internet hiccup we had earlier, we didn't get onto many of the social

627
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:32,360
networking, but also, uh, we got a voicemail from Breslul and he wants to update you guys

628
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,560
on usl madness and what is going on there in our forums.

629
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:41,920
So I want to go to the voicemail and oh, did I delete it?

630
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,920
I hope not.

631
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,920
Oops.

632
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,760
When we did the reboot earlier, I might've deleted his voicemail.

633
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,760
Whoopsie.

634
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,200
Let's see if I can get to it here.

635
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,200
And here we go.

636
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,200
Here's his voicemail.

637
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,280
Here's a voicemail from Breslul about what is going on in usl madness at our forums at

638
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,280
orange launch radio.com.

639
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:05,360
Hello Orange Lounge Radio, it's Breslul once again, reminding you and the listeners to give

640
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,240
us some votes here on usl madness.

641
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,440
We have some fantastic match-ups in the round of 32.

642
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,960
We've got a heated one between Final Fantasy 7 and Pokemon.

643
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,280
Mega Man 2 is facing Mega Man 3, one of the most bizarre match-ups of the tournament.

644
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,120
Ocarina of Timers and Tecmo Super Bowl, Earthbound vs Secret of Mana.

645
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,080
I could go on, but there's not enough time in the show.

646
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:31,040
But please visit our forums, get yourself an account and vote today because half of

647
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:37,400
these games go away and then next week is the sweet 16 where things get incredibly interesting.

648
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,880
Once again, log on to our forums and vote.

649
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:48,120
We'll talk to you later and usl will be back on the, let me try that again, usl will be

650
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,800
back on February 27th.

651
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,800
We'll see you then.

652
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,800
Till then.

653
00:28:53,800 --> 00:29:00,120
Now that was Breslul from Understation Live, Saturday nights at All Games Radio, allgamesradio.com

654
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:05,000
or if you want just the radio feed, it's allgamesradio.com and they'll be back on Saturday.

655
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,160
But yeah, Breslul and Travis, they team up with us to do this usl madness, which is kind

656
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,360
of like a take on March Madness, if you don't know what it is, where they try to define

657
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,160
the greatest video game of all time and everybody submits their list and then he seeds it like

658
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,640
it was basketball games.

659
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,440
And Guardian Legend wins.

660
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,520
Guardian Legend wasn't even like in the top 64 on people's list.

661
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,520
It was on my list.

662
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:28,000
I had it in my top 25 games of all time, but I guess that wasn't enough because admittedly

663
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,400
it wasn't number one, sorry Jamie.

664
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,520
But there's, yeah, as he said in the voicemail, there's some pretty epic match-ups going on

665
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,520
right now.

666
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,440
Like Mega Man 2 versus Mega Man 3, how do you even decide between those two games?

667
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,720
Like it's practically the same guy.

668
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,840
I said two as well.

669
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,800
What is it that draws you to two over three though?

670
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,800
Do you think?

671
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,600
I like the number two better than three.

672
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,720
Bubble Man stage music.

673
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,320
Metal blades.

674
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,160
I think it's just the fact that, well for me and the way I rationalized it when I voted

675
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,520
on the forums was that Mega Man 2 was kind of set the bar.

676
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:02,960
Like obviously Mega Man 1 was the original, but you know, it had all these things like

677
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,600
scoring and less bosses and kind of a different interface and everything.

678
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,760
Mega Man 2 kind of really polished that and really Mega Man 3 is just Mega Man 2 with

679
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,920
some new thrills in it.

680
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:17,920
But Mega Man 2 was so important that those bosses came back in three.

681
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:22,120
Mega Man 2 was one of my, I'd have to say my big accomplishments because I used to be

682
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,640
able to do the dragon level blindfolded.

683
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,640
I remember, I remember you telling me about that and I used to be able to play that game

684
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,440
like, you know, through in one sitting too.

685
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,120
Because that level has like, it's all about timing with that level.

686
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,520
The only other, like I said, the only other game I've been able to do that with is World

687
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,160
8-1 and Super Mario Brothers.

688
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,160
Nice.

689
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,160
Very cool.

690
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,040
Yeah, so I don't know, it's just something about, I mean not that Mega Man 3 is a bad

691
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,720
game by any means, but that's the tough thing about March Madness is you have to sometimes

692
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,720
look at two good games.

693
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,040
Now here's the other interesting one.

694
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,160
There's Final Fantasy 7 versus Pokemon going on right now.

695
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:54,160
And I notice there's interesting, Pokemon is winning as of the time of the show.

696
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:58,520
Final Fantasy 7 is, it seems like a lot of the vote isn't, I mean I could be wrong, but

697
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:03,420
there's a lot of vote that is not for Pokemon so much as it is against Final Fantasy 7 because

698
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,420
of all the fanboy wank.

699
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:08,520
And I was trying to figure out why that is because I don't think Final Fantasy 7 is the

700
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:14,480
best Final Fantasy, but certainly like, it was the game that got me to buy a Playstation.

701
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,480
It was, you know.

702
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,080
I owned that game before, I had a Playstation.

703
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,080
How does that work?

704
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,080
My roommate had one.

705
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,080
Oh.

706
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:25,840
And yeah, you know, I just remember it just changed the way you kind of perceive Final

707
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,000
Fantasy games because it was so different from the sprite based ones.

708
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:35,120
But I agree the fan wank got a little crazy, but I can't hold that against the game.

709
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,880
But I don't know, but then you look at a series like Pokemon and that's like a cult.

710
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:44,760
That's like, I don't even know, like Pokemon sucks people in and doesn't let them go.

711
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,760
It's like.

712
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,760
I don't get it.

713
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,760
Yeah.

714
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,760
I don't know.

715
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,760
But yeah, whatever.

716
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,980
I can't be mad I guess.

717
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,980
That's what happens.

718
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:55,000
Every gamer has a voice even when that voice is whack.

719
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,480
Www dot orange lounge radio.com no disrespect to the Pokemon fans.

720
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:04,160
I just, I, to me, they're kind of all the same game.

721
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,000
Like I are all the same game.

722
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Look.

723
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Oh my God.

724
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,320
We discovered new Pokemon that are no way similar to the other Pokemon.

725
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,320
Buy more games.

726
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,320
All right.

727
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,600
Before you send in the hate mail though.

728
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,320
I was there when the first movie came out in theaters.

729
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,320
I went and saw it opening night.

730
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,320
Okay.

731
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,320
So I think I went with you.

732
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,320
Didn't I?

733
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,320
No, I went Chico.

734
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,320
No, that's right.

735
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,700
Because I, I got the important.

736
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,640
You might've went to the second one with me because I went and saw the second one too.

737
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:32,280
I saw the third one with you at the theater probably, but I had, but I had to import a

738
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:36,120
copy of the, of the Japanese one.

739
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,440
So yeah, don't send in the hate mail.

740
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,600
I Pokemon's fine.

741
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,840
I just, I, where are they going to go with it?

742
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:47,540
It's just, I, if they just make more Pokemon, if they made an MMO, I try it.

743
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,540
I would.

744
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,540
And then they have the record.

745
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,800
I still think Digimon's cooler.

746
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,840
All right, let's get into some gaming news.

747
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,880
We're like what, 30 minutes in the show after a 15 minute late start, we haven't even covered

748
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,880
news yet.

749
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,880
This is going to be a 10 o'clock at night show.

750
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,880
Let's see what happens.

751
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,880
That's 1am for you East coasters.

752
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,640
Let's get started on some gaming news.

753
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,640
Loki.

754
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,640
Okay.

755
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:10,680
So, um, the ESA did a survey, um, or I shouldn't really say a survey, but they did research

756
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,740
focusing on 200 specific titles during the month of December.

757
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:18,280
Not necessarily stuff that came out in December, but just during that month.

758
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:28,640
And it showed that of those 200 titles, there were 9.78 million illegal downloads for those

759
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,400
titles during the month of December.

760
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:37,200
And the, uh, you might think, okay, well maybe the U.S. is, you know, to blame because there's

761
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,920
a lot of people in the U.S. at pirate.

762
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:43,200
But actually, no, there's other countries that were a lot higher.

763
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:50,720
In fact, um, the highest number of unauthorized downloads came from Italy with 20.3% of the

764
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,720
total.

765
00:33:51,720 --> 00:34:00,200
Spain, following that with a 12.5%, France with 7.5% and China with 5.7%.

766
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,200
Interesting.

767
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,200
Now, okay.

768
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,160
I know there might be more to that story, so I apologize for interrupting you, but um,

769
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,880
you know, when I hear the news about the piracy and the numbers, I don't think the, of the

770
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
U.S. is number one.

771
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,960
I think a lot of people think, oh, that's all in the U.S. or whatever, but no, I, but

772
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,180
I blame Luxembourg.

773
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,800
The countries I think of are not the ones you're naming.

774
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,440
Like I usually think, you know, because of the stereotypes about being able to buy bootlegs

775
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:28,800
in Hong Kong, like right on the street corners and you know, knowing of all that that goes

776
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,340
on, I would think it's like Hong Kong, Taiwan.

777
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:35,360
Those would be the types of places that would be the tops for piracy, but Italy?

778
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:40,600
Now pardon my ignorance for those overseas listeners, but I've never even been over to

779
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,840
the other side of the Atlantic.

780
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,840
So sorry.

781
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:46,000
I know we have a lot of listeners over there cause we try to let every gamer have a voice,

782
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,120
including our friends from overseas.

783
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:52,160
But is there something about Italy where like the distribution that gets to the rest of

784
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,160
Europe doesn't get there or something?

785
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,160
I have no idea.

786
00:34:55,160 --> 00:35:00,060
Um, but they said also that of that, you know, those 10 million, those aren't even really

787
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:03,400
a full picture of, you know, what's being downloaded.

788
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,540
I think it's just all modern warfare too.

789
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,540
It's probably what it was.

790
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:11,720
Well, cause my thought is, you know, is that I've gotten into this topic before and I don't

791
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:16,040
know if it was on a call with Bobby show at the end or if it was on this show, but um,

792
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,960
that I think a lot of this piracy comes from folks that can't get the game through legal

793
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,040
means turn to piracy.

794
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,840
And that's why I kind of question, well, does Italy get game releases when the rest of,

795
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,780
you know, those countries over there get them?

796
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:34,160
Or is there something about Italy where, and Spain and some of those other countries you

797
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,740
named where they don't get the games at the same time so people turn to piracy?

798
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:42,920
Like are there laws where maybe the game has to be in a local language like Italian or

799
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,240
Spanish so they can't release them there?

800
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,240
I don't know.

801
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,240
I don't know.

802
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:51,600
I don't really hear a lot of just, um, you know, I don't really hear of anything being

803
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,480
delayed there, but I mean, I don't really know.

804
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,720
We never hear like, you know, Italy's not getting the game cause it's been censored

805
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,720
or something like that.

806
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,560
It's always Germany or New Zealand or Australia.

807
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,960
They gotta catch them all.

808
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,240
Well, I would love to hear from a listener and you know, cause I know we have some listeners

809
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,240
over there.

810
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,680
If you're listening and you're in one of those countries, Loki named, I would love to get

811
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,240
an email from you.

812
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,760
Why do you think piracy is so rampant where you live?

813
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,640
I mean, is the legal just difficult or expensive or what?

814
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,360
Cause I think, I don't know.

815
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,500
Why do people turn to piracy in the US?

816
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,520
Because they blame the $60 price point of a console game.

817
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,880
You know, I'm, I'm too poor, I'm a, I'm a starving student or whatever it is, you know,

818
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:35,080
try to justify it with, you know, the whole Robin Hood philosophy of steal from the rich

819
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,120
and give to the poor.

820
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,680
That's what motivates most piracy.

821
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,080
You know, I'm not saying a good thing about that.

822
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,740
I'm just, I'm just saying what I see.

823
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,960
That's just kind of what it seems to be.

824
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,840
It's, it's the whole Robin Hood approach.

825
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,160
So anyhow, uh, well be careful.

826
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,760
I don't think it's as altruistic as Robin Hood's intent.

827
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,880
It's rob from the rich and give to me.

828
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,880
Okay.

829
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,880
Fair enough.

830
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,880
All right.

831
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,600
Well, speaking of piracy, you might want to be a little bit careful if you're into that.

832
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,800
Keep in mind, you know, piracy is not legal, just a reminder, you know, so you are walking

833
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,240
a dangerous line.

834
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,960
Um, so that is evidenced by what's going on in Australia right now.

835
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,480
In fact, when I first read this story, I was like, Oh, what is this?

836
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:17,080
This is, do we already read about this last week when some pirate got busted in Australia?

837
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,040
No, this is something else.

838
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:24,560
Nintendo is actually managed to win a case against the R4 mod cartridge for the DS.

839
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,400
What happened is that Nintendo actually won a lawsuit against, uh, the Australian distributor

840
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,400
of the R4.

841
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,880
Uh, this is coming from the news lines in Australia.

842
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:37,320
Uh, apparently gadget gear.com.au cause all the Australian ones in today, you, they were

843
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,560
actually told they have to stop selling the device.

844
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:47,320
They got fined the equivalent of $466,000, uh, the folks that were named in the suit,

845
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:52,400
Patrick Lee and James Lee, I guess they also kind of sold this independently, not through

846
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,400
the same site.

847
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,760
Uh, but they also were fined $100,000 Australian.

848
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,920
That's about 90,000 here.

849
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,960
Also what I think is interesting is part of the settlement or I'm sorry, not settlement,

850
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,960
but suit.

851
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,400
Uh, they have to disclose who is supplying the R4 chips.

852
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,400
Hmm.

853
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,640
So that again is just, that's the second in like a week's time of Nintendo winning some

854
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,640
anti-piracy.

855
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,640
I think it's dumb.

856
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:21,680
The, you know, I mean those chips, I understand that they can be used for piracy, but a computer

857
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,020
can be used for piracy.

858
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:26,320
So yeah, we're going to make computers legal now too.

859
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:31,160
I mean it's just, you have to go after the, sadly enough, you have to go after the people

860
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:35,080
that are using the pirate stuff or I don't know, here's a thought.

861
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,120
Go after people putting ROMs online.

862
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:43,000
It won't matter if you have the stupid chip for your DS because it won't work with anything.

863
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,060
There's no fucking ROMs out there.

864
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:50,600
Oddly enough, I kind of agree with you and I think your computer analogy, you know, even

865
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:55,120
though I don't own an R4 and I don't think I would get into all this stuff, I have two

866
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,120
and a G3.

867
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,200
I have two Ninja passes.

868
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:03,560
I think, okay, I think, you know, I, I'm, I feel like I'm too stupid to really get into

869
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,560
all that stuff.

870
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,760
I don't know what it is, but I think if I had one, I'd want to play like homebrew stuff

871
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,040
on it is probably what I would be into.

872
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,760
You know, I, I like having the real deal because then I know I'm going to get online and not

873
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,560
get my system bricked and you know, all of that, like I'm willing to pay the extra money

874
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,880
just for ease of mind in that regard.

875
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:25,320
But as far as like the R4 stuff goes, I think when you buy a device like that, yeah, I should

876
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,960
be able to use the parts for whatever I want.

877
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,580
As long as I'm not stealing, I get the problem with piracy.

878
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:35,880
You're stealing someone else's property like, you know, that they spent money to create

879
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,880
the wrong people.

880
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:42,120
But if somebody wants to put a free ROM on the internet for their free public domain,

881
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,840
just like somebody puts their music up on MySpace, they want you to download it and

882
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,280
listen to it to get their band name out there.

883
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:54,260
It's just like people, it'd be going after, it'd be like going after somebody, um, or

884
00:39:54,260 --> 00:40:00,120
a camcorder company because somebody used it to pirate a film.

885
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:06,120
You can't do that just because it's a device that allows you to run unauthorized stuff.

886
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:10,560
I guess they could just, you know, stop the, you know, ban them from manufacturing it or

887
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,760
they could try.

888
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,120
But if it's unauthorized in the first place and there's not a lot you can do to lock it

889
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:20,520
out since they can't really update the hardware to do that, um, via firmware or anything.

890
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:28,080
But um, I don't know, I mean it, there are a lot of legitimate uses for it besides piracy.

891
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:33,520
For the record, I haven't used mine to play anything in months because I just don't care

892
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,520
anymore.

893
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,160
I have to admit, I'm kind of in the same boat.

894
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,480
Like even when I was moving this weekend, I found just like tons and tons of DS and

895
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,480
PSP games.

896
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,320
I'm like, I don't even remember the last time I touched these cause, but if you've listened

897
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,400
to the show before, you know, I have this weird thing against handheld gaming.

898
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,280
Like I just can't, games are meant for my television.

899
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,280
Like I can't play them sitting there.

900
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:58,760
I feel, I don't know, dirty, not dirty, and there's been some really good handheld games

901
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,760
too.

902
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,720
Like Final Fantasy four on the DS loved it, you know, and yeah, there's non Final Fantasy

903
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,720
games too, you know?

904
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:10,400
Well, I, the last thing I was playing was, um, the Zelda, um, spirit tracks, but I even

905
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,040
got bored of that.

906
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,000
I shouldn't be getting bored of a Zelda game.

907
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,500
I mean, come on, it's Zelda, it's awesome.

908
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:23,200
Do you think maybe your expectations have kind of no, but they didn't really do that

909
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:28,120
much different other than look now, now links right in a train instead of a boat.

910
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,760
I mean, it's the same damn game.

911
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,760
Okay.

912
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,660
I'm going to take the tangent train for a minute here, but like we kind of got into

913
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,920
it a couple of weeks ago on the show.

914
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,200
I remember talking about game room and some of these old arcade games and Atari 2,600

915
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,580
games and some folks saying that, you know, they're repetitive, they're boring.

916
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:46,500
And I'm thinking that's what it was all about back when you know, those games first came

917
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,500
out.

918
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,500
What's wrong with you?

919
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:53,320
You know, like, are we just, have our expectations about what makes a good game like changed

920
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,320
in that regard?

921
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,480
I guess they have to some extent, you know, it would be like this.

922
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:04,300
It would be like saying, okay, um, I'm playing Pac-Man Pac-Man's cool.

923
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,820
And then we come out with Pac-Man two, which is exactly the same as Pac-Man one, except

924
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:11,720
now the screen is blue and purple instead of like yellow and blue.

925
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:16,480
That's basically the difference between, you know, Ms. Pac-Man, but she has a bone.

926
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:21,480
She has a bow and you know, it's slightly different, but no, seriously, it's, it's almost

927
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:25,240
like they've said, okay, well, what can we do to put the least amount of effort into

928
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,340
this so we can release a sequel really quick?

929
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,340
And yes, I understand.

930
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:33,880
Ooh, it's, I mean, they don't even try to tie any of the games storyline wise together.

931
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:40,480
Oh yes, it's another adventurer who happens to look the same as Link and his name is Link.

932
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,880
And now, uh, he has got to go rescue this Princess Zelda, who's not the same Princess

933
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,940
Zelda, even though she looked exactly the same as the last game.

934
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,700
Don't they do that in all the Zelda games?

935
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:54,340
Like aren't all the links like different links, but there could, I mean, sometimes they're

936
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,400
the same link depending on what game you're playing.

937
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,520
It's just, it's, it's lazy is what it is.

938
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,580
It's like, oh, let's, I thought that's why the name was Link.

939
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:05,860
Cause they're all linked from my just dumb.

940
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,500
I don't think that's why.

941
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,500
All right, fine.

942
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:13,860
All right, let's move on with some other gaming news before I take the tangent train somewhere

943
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:14,860
else.

944
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,700
Do you have a news story to save us here a little bit?

945
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,700
I do.

946
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,580
I'm, I'm tangled up in yarn.

947
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:20,580
No.

948
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:29,660
Um, there is a bit more about, uh, EA, um, servers being a big clank putting on them.

949
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:37,260
On March 16th, we have, um, service shut down for death jam for PS3, Godfather for PS3 and

950
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:44,140
Xbox 360, Lord of the Rings conquest, Mercenaries 2, need for speed carbon on portable, um,

951
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:50,460
need for speed, um, pro street PSP, Simpsons, um, for PlayStation three and Xbox 360, April

952
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:56,420
15th, burnout three take down, um, army of two for PS3, but that's only in Asia.

953
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:03,100
And then, um, of course we have a ton of original Xbox being shut down after that and PS2 games.

954
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:10,060
So yeah, a lot, uh, pretty much everything that's Xbox PS2 earlier and, um, tiger woods.

955
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,060
So,

956
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:15,380
you know, I'm surprised that, uh, I mean, there's some of the games on there like Simpsons.

957
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:18,580
I don't remember there being online for that.

958
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:23,300
Um, it was funny though, cause even like a Def Jam icon, that was one of those kids.

959
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,300
Oh yeah.

960
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,260
You can put your music in there and you know, play and stuff.

961
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,260
I'm like, Oh yeah.

962
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:30,780
If we put some weird like DDR music in there, that'd be really funny.

963
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,780
Cause it's meant for more like hip hop stuff.

964
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:33,780
Yeah.

965
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:34,780
Oh well.

966
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:35,780
No.

967
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:38,300
Well, you know, and it's not really surprising.

968
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:44,980
I mean, it costs money to run the servers and if they're not making any more money on

969
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:49,140
these games and you know, new stuff's going to be coming out, what's the point of keeping

970
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,140
it around?

971
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:51,140
Yeah.

972
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:53,180
Well, there's a lot of companies out there that don't really have these servers that

973
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:54,180
they shut down.

974
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:57,620
I mean, um, really EA is the main one we hear about every now and then.

975
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:04,540
Um, and then I think we had one from Sega when they shut down the server for Chrome

976
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:10,540
hounds, but I mean, those are the only ones I've heard of for like a while.

977
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:11,540
So I don't know.

978
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:12,540
That's kind of interesting.

979
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:18,820
Well, and you know, Xbox original getting shut down is, you know, somewhat notable,

980
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:22,640
you know, just, but that's just, that's just a matter of time.

981
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,780
But I don't understand like current generation stuff, the servers being shut down for them.

982
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:29,020
I mean, that's just kind of weird.

983
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:33,220
I can understand like, you know, okay, yeah, we're moving on to the PlayStation four, you

984
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:36,540
know, the PlayStation network for PlayStation three is going to have to go away and keep

985
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:43,140
in mind also looking again, economy wise, you know, a lot of companies are losing money

986
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,140
anyway.

987
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:47,620
If they're trying to mitigate, I fully believe that it's just, it's to mitigate cost.

988
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:48,620
I really do.

989
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,620
I think that's part of it too.

990
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:55,020
And Loki, as you said earlier, you play what grand theft auto and nobody's ever online.

991
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:57,380
I'm kind of surprised they're not threatening to pull the plug on that.

992
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:00,420
If people aren't using it, it's costing them to keep the they are just, they're not playing

993
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:01,420
what I'm playing.

994
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:02,420
I see.

995
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:07,380
I mean, specific settings, um, cause we play with auto aim off and some newbie players

996
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:11,860
out there like play with auto aim on and that would be me.

997
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:17,660
And uh, so because of that, anybody is searching for a game with auto aim on, they're only

998
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:19,220
going to find auto aim on games.

999
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,940
So you have to specify that.

1000
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:24,080
But I mean, how many people are really playing like Godfather online anymore?

1001
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,080
You know, it's probably really hard.

1002
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:29,080
Probably not that many people like, I mean, put it this way, like for like validate Tony

1003
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:33,020
right now, which is one of the expansions, but most people are playing the vanilla grand

1004
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:34,020
theft auto stuff.

1005
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:38,260
I mean, so I'm sure there's, you know, hundreds of thousands of people online for, um, the

1006
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:39,260
battle of gay Tony.

1007
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:42,940
There's at least 50,000 people on the ranked leaderboards, um, right now.

1008
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:46,180
So um, there's a lot of people out there.

1009
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:51,380
It's just, you know, whether they may be wanting to play just free mode or just, you know,

1010
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:58,140
some other, you know, death match, non ranked, you know, team death match, who knows?

1011
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,140
All right.

1012
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:00,940
Uh, chat dot orange lounge, radio.com.

1013
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:04,700
If you want to join us, uh, X-link reminds us they've also shut down the servers for

1014
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:07,460
the PS two and PC versions of fantasy star universe.

1015
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,380
That was another big recent one.

1016
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:13,180
Fantasy star universe is starting to disappear, which is a pretty big deal, but yeah, I'm

1017
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:14,180
not kind of not surprised.

1018
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:17,280
A lot of the communities on X-Box three 60 cause wasn't that the only way you had the

1019
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,900
voice enabled in it too, maybe.

1020
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:20,900
Yeah.

1021
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:25,260
So, well of course you could always use something like ventrilo or something on the PC, I suppose.

1022
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,960
Well let's move on.

1023
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,500
So one thing that would suck if the server shut down for it would be, um, Ubisoft's new

1024
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,380
PC DRM servers.

1025
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:38,020
Um, apparently of course they revealed the plan back in January that they're going to

1026
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:44,000
streamline their DM DRM process across all PC titles by making players log into Ubisoft

1027
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,040
servers to authenticate before playing.

1028
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:52,980
Now that doesn't sound too bad right now, but there's a few things of course you have

1029
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,400
to understand.

1030
00:47:54,400 --> 00:48:00,540
It's um, the system is kind of flawed and the reason being is for example, if your connection

1031
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:05,660
experiences any sort of issue, uh, you know, whether it be like, you know, dropping bandwidth

1032
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:11,220
or momentary pause, router reboot or whatever, the software will immediately boot you out

1033
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:17,020
of your game back to the main menu and you'll lose all your progress until, you know, up

1034
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:19,460
to the previous save.

1035
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,940
And um, that's it.

1036
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:27,980
So, um, if Ubisoft's master servers encounter any errors, then all the players with a working

1037
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:32,080
connection logged into the servers will not be able to play their games until the servers

1038
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,080
are back online.

1039
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:38,260
Oh gee, Ubisoft's customer support isn't about to blow up or anything.

1040
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:43,100
So you know, um, doesn't Ubisoft make the like imagine games?

1041
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:44,100
Yes they do.

1042
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:45,100
Okay.

1043
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:47,580
So I imagine there's equivalents of that on the PC, right?

1044
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:51,260
Well the main, the two titles that are going to be coming up, and this is according to

1045
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:57,940
PC gaming, they tested the two upcoming titles, um, Assassin's Creed 2 and Settlers 7.

1046
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:02,780
I don't think they have any imagine games for a PC, but they would have this DRM if

1047
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:03,780
they did.

1048
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:04,780
And that's where I'm going with this.

1049
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:09,800
And you know, not everybody that would be buying a game like that is tech savvy enough

1050
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,540
to understand what DRM even is.

1051
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:16,580
You know, certainly not, the type of people that buy those imagine games are probably

1052
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:19,460
not the same people that listen to this podcast unless of course they're buying it for their

1053
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:20,460
kids.

1054
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:26,980
You know, my point is, you're going to have these, uh, moms buying it for their daughters

1055
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:31,860
and you know, people that don't really follow gaming or understand what DRM even is that

1056
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:33,860
just know the game isn't going to fire up on the computer.

1057
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:35,460
Who's going to get the phone call about that?

1058
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:39,700
The phone calls are going to go to Ubisoft or they're going to go to targets and Walmarts

1059
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,100
across the country.

1060
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:44,820
And when that starts happening, they're going to stop carrying it.

1061
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:45,820
Exactly.

1062
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:52,220
Um, I have a feeling, um, that this will be cracked in probably a few days.

1063
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:56,660
Well, usually those types of things are, and people are going to turn to that and sadly

1064
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,020
it what's going to end up happening.

1065
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:04,580
But unfortunately, soccer mom Jones who buys this for her daughter, you'll imagine, I don't

1066
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:06,780
know, dress up shop or whatever they come out with.

1067
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:07,980
How many of those imagine games are there?

1068
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,380
We were a target last too many.

1069
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:12,740
How many of those imagine games were there on the shelf, Alan, like, like 5,000, right?

1070
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:13,740
At least a dozen.

1071
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:14,740
Yeah.

1072
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:21,420
I just caught your eye right next to cooking mama one, two, three, and gardening mama.

1073
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:28,700
And you know, it's just everything crazy anyhow, uh, while we're talking about online authentication,

1074
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,260
I think this is kind of interesting.

1075
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:33,060
It's almost like a combination of the past couple of stories we've been hearing about,

1076
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:39,280
you know, server costs to maintain as well as a little bit about the, uh, DRM, um, so

1077
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,980
come fire team Bravo three.

1078
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:46,500
If you are going to be playing this game on the PSP, you're going to get a code so that

1079
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:50,620
you can go and redeem it on the PlayStation network and you'll be able to access the game

1080
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:51,620
online.

1081
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:56,340
But if you don't buy this game either directly through PSN because it will automatically

1082
00:50:56,340 --> 00:51:02,260
be enabled or you get the code new, you will have to shell out $20 to get the license to

1083
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:03,820
let you play online.

1084
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:04,940
Think about that for a minute.

1085
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:08,780
What that basically means is they're kind of targeting people who are going after this

1086
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:12,340
used or the people who buy this second hand, because think about it.

1087
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:14,320
If you buy it new, you'll get a code.

1088
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:17,280
If you buy it online, you don't need a code cause you bought it online.

1089
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,900
But if you buy it used, no code for you.

1090
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:22,380
Well, it's for piracy really.

1091
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:26,260
You think that's part of it or you think it's, that's what they're targeting it for.

1092
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:27,260
I see.

1093
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:28,260
So $20 to be able to actually play.

1094
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,500
You know what I hear the funniest part about though.

1095
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:34,260
Wouldn't they be, what wouldn't a pirated game not be able to go online to get authenticated

1096
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:35,260
though?

1097
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,540
No, it can, it can go online.

1098
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:40,700
Interesting because pirated games, basically they act like just installed games, but here's

1099
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:44,260
the, here's the best part.

1100
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:48,260
Sony actually has a workaround for it in their own system.

1101
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:53,360
And the reason this is, can grant it, you can't play online games, but thanks to that

1102
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,420
wonderful and I don't remember what the hell it's called now, but remember how you can

1103
00:51:56,420 --> 00:52:00,380
do ad hoc over the internet with Sony PlayStation three?

1104
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:04,660
Well, guess I don't need to go online to play other people online.

1105
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:09,180
I can just go ad hoc over the internet and it works just fine.

1106
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:10,380
It's not lag city or anything.

1107
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,020
No, it shouldn't be.

1108
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:13,020
Interesting.

1109
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:17,560
By the way, uh, John color from Sony actually, I was quoted to IGN saying it's quote a trial

1110
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:20,900
run for a new initiative we are exploring for the platform.

1111
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:25,620
So even if you're like, ah, fuck it, I don't play SOCOM, uh, this could still be in the

1112
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:27,580
future impacting a game you play.

1113
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:33,660
They're waiting to see how long it's cracked and it probably will get cracked somehow.

1114
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:36,180
They don't think they use thing has anything to do with it.

1115
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:38,180
Oh, I'm sure that it has a little bit to do with it.

1116
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:42,740
That's why they also were testing out the market with, um, like member local, not local

1117
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:49,940
record to, um, pot upon two, I think where they had the game in a retail box, but all

1118
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:52,020
it was was a card with a scratch off.

1119
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:53,020
Oh yeah.

1120
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:54,020
And I saw that at fries.

1121
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:55,020
Yeah.

1122
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,020
You know, so that's another thing.

1123
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:57,300
They were test marketing.

1124
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:02,140
So I'm just thinking if I were to pick up this game used, I'd be kind of irritated that

1125
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:04,220
I have to go online and pay another $20.

1126
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:07,540
Like again, here we go with the angry phone calls from people who don't know better to

1127
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:09,180
this time GameStop.

1128
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:13,180
And if I were GameStop, you know, and you can use that term loosely to describe whatever

1129
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:16,520
game store makes their bread and butter off of used games and happens to sell new games

1130
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:17,520
as well.

1131
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,520
I'd be kind of pissed.

1132
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:23,580
And I would like, can you imagine, especially with such a powerhouse that GameStop is, and

1133
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:27,380
we'll just throw in all the other, you know, like companies in there, okay.

1134
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:32,060
Like the powerhouse that they are with something like this kind of going after their used market,

1135
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:35,740
can you imagine if they were to say, and they have the power to do this, they run a magazine

1136
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:36,980
for heaven's sake.

1137
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,020
They could discourage people from buying the game.

1138
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:40,020
Think about it.

1139
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,020
What's to stop.

1140
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:45,640
I mean, this, this might be a little conspiracy theory here, but what's to stop GameStop from

1141
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:50,560
publishing a negative review in this game in Game Informer, which is the most popular

1142
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:54,820
video game magazine out there that happens to be run by GameStop to discourage people

1143
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:57,980
from buying this game for no other reason than it cuts into the used game market.

1144
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:01,280
But yet they use this whole, they're going to get to with the $20 thing.

1145
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,280
It's the reason.

1146
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:06,240
But the real reason is the bottom line of the game stores because they need the advertising

1147
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:11,020
dollars that are provided by Sony to be able to run their magazine.

1148
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:15,740
But the same thing though, they could basically discourage people from, you know, buying the

1149
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:21,820
game without writing a negative review and use the employees letting people know.

1150
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:27,520
But I would think at the same time that this could be bad for Sony anyways, because when

1151
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:32,160
a competing game comes out there, let's see, am I going to buy the game that won't let

1152
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:36,760
me play online unless I pay $20 or the other game that's equally cool that I can play online

1153
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:37,760
for free?

1154
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:38,760
Hmm.

1155
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:39,760
That's a tough one.

1156
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,200
I will go with the free one.

1157
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,200
Let's see.

1158
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,200
Tiger Claw in our chat room.

1159
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:49,160
chat.orangeslaungeradio.com says, I wonder what if Sony sells this game in twos?

1160
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:53,120
For example, what if you want to only buy the multiplayer part, couldn't you just purchase

1161
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:57,240
the multiplayer game itself and not the full single player?

1162
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:01,000
And here's the problem too with the SOCOM 3.

1163
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,300
It's not a discounted game.

1164
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,680
It's a full price game.

1165
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:11,560
So it's not like, hey, we're selling this for 20 bucks, but you know, if you want to

1166
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:17,000
go online to pay the other 20 and then, you know, equal the cost of a full price game.

1167
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,580
No, it's nothing like that where they're offering a discount.

1168
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:22,920
It's a full price game and then you have to pay another $20 on top of it.

1169
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,480
Well, you know what I say, if you don't like it, don't buy it.

1170
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:26,480
End of story.

1171
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,040
I mean, that's really what it is.

1172
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,040
If you don't like it, don't buy it.

1173
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,280
But I mean, a game like this SOCOM has its fan base.

1174
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,280
This is good.

1175
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,360
There's people that aren't even going to bat an eye at this because they already are going

1176
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,960
to buy the game new.

1177
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:37,960
They'll find a way.

1178
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,520
No, we'll see what happens.

1179
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,520
Let's move on with some more stories.

1180
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,200
We've got release dates coming up as well as the classic game of the week and a little

1181
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,080
bit here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1182
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,720
Well, this is some good news.

1183
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,720
How about something happy?

1184
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,720
Yay.

1185
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:51,720
Happy.

1186
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:52,720
It looks happy for me because I'm playing it.

1187
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:53,720
You're going to give me money?

1188
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:54,720
Yay.

1189
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:55,720
I'm not playing that game.

1190
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:56,720
I'm not playing that game.

1191
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:57,720
I'm not playing that game.

1192
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:58,720
Star Trek.

1193
00:55:58,720 --> 00:55:59,720
Star Trek Online.

1194
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:05,520
They are actually working on ways of opening up the ship so that you can explore more of

1195
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,520
your own ship.

1196
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:10,440
You know, so far, all you can do is go hang out on the bridge and that's kind of boring.

1197
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:16,880
You know, I look at my Andorian dude just, you know, piloting, I'm like, okay, he's piloting.

1198
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:22,160
And I can sit in my captain's chair, ooh, but you can't really do much.

1199
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:26,720
I mean, you can invite people there, but I would really like to, I even think it would

1200
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:30,960
be cool to have like, you know, in ship missions, you know, that would be cool.

1201
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,040
You know, you have to fight the Borg in the middle of your ship or something.

1202
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:35,040
Oh, like first contact.

1203
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,040
Yeah.

1204
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,160
By the way, I thought you said happy news, not nerdy news.

1205
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,160
It is happy news.

1206
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,160
I'm just kidding.

1207
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:46,040
I said it was happy for me, but, um, they basically want to make it more, you know,

1208
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:50,560
do what they can to make it more like actual Star Trek.

1209
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:53,880
And this is something that they've quoted as saying that it's something that they want

1210
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:58,120
to do, but they're not going to implement it until they have it working flawlessly.

1211
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:01,200
Well of course, you don't want, especially with an MMO, you'll piss off your user base

1212
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,000
if you roll out something that's all flawed.

1213
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,040
I want a holodeck.

1214
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,680
Would I be able to, a holodeck would be cool.

1215
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,880
Would I also be able to walk around the ship and demand that people bow down before me

1216
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,760
or I'll shoot to kill?

1217
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:12,760
No.

1218
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:17,720
However, um, I get, I bet if you're, you know, I see, I think it would be cool if you could

1219
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,560
actually, you know, do like rank things going up through your ship too.

1220
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:24,600
But then that means you're, if you're on the Klingon ship and you do something your subordinates

1221
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:28,920
think is cowardly, they can challenge you to a doodle of death.

1222
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:29,920
Interesting.

1223
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,000
Well, at least that's how it works on a Klingon ship.

1224
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I want to change my music and have Klingon opera playing in the background on my Klingon

1225
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
ship.

1226
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,200
I think you should have a, there's Klingons on the starboard bow, starboard bow, starboard

1227
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,460
bow.

1228
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,320
That was nerdier than what I said.

1229
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,320
Okay.

1230
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,320
Touche.

1231
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,320
All right.

1232
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:51,240
We're going to travel around the world now and check out some release dates and some

1233
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,560
things coming to a store near you.

1234
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:54,560
Yes.

1235
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:57,080
This week I actually got some pretty cool stuff coming out.

1236
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:02,200
I'm starting off with Endless Ocean Blue World coming out on the Nintendo Wii.

1237
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:06,140
You can also find that with a bundle with Wii Speak because yes, you can play this game

1238
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:10,160
online and talk to each other while you're under the sea.

1239
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:16,880
On Xbox 360 Risen, the ever delayed game now coming out on Xbox 360 and I believe the PC

1240
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,000
version came out last October.

1241
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Lovely Lisa and Friends on the DS apparently from the Tommy Corporation.

1242
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,080
I believe it's a doll that's actually in Japan.

1243
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,480
Why this is being brought out over here is beyond me.

1244
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:30,520
Because she's lovely.

1245
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,520
I guess.

1246
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:42,360
Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii DS and PSP.

1247
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:46,920
And of course that's going to feature all your favorite Sonic characters or Sega characters

1248
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:53,600
and Banjo-Kazooie of course in the Xbox 360 version.

1249
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:57,320
See here.

1250
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,600
Hello Kitty Birthday Adventures on DS.

1251
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:00,600
Yippee.

1252
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:01,600
Yeah.

1253
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,640
I know.

1254
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:06,760
Napoleon Total War coming out on PC.

1255
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:10,320
Pony Friends 2 coming out on DS.

1256
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:13,200
Anything our listeners might actually want to buy?

1257
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,200
What are you saying?

1258
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,680
Pony Friends 2 is not on the top of their list?

1259
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,560
You know, I'm thinking no.

1260
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:20,000
Well that's too bad.

1261
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,960
Heavy Rain coming out on PlayStation 3 this week as well.

1262
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:29,880
And then, let's see, wrapping it up, Deck of Sports on DS.

1263
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:34,240
Oh, Deck of Sports was the one that had curling in it, right?

1264
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,880
Yes, I'm not sure if the DS version has curling in it.

1265
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,640
I love Winter Olympics time of year.

1266
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:43,400
But I know they have a bunch of other stuff in there.

1267
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:46,720
I think it's maybe new sports in the DS version.

1268
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:50,560
Of course, it's not going to let me see it, so.

1269
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:51,560
Oh well.

1270
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:55,200
Alright, well should I travel over to Japan and take a look at the releases over there?

1271
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,200
Sure.

1272
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,200
Alright.

1273
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,200
Hi.

1274
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:02,200
Coming out on February 25th on the Xbox 360, a localized version of Borderlands comes out

1275
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,640
from 2K Games.

1276
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:10,000
Also a game called Espgaluda 2, a black label comes out in the limited edition and regular

1277
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
formats.

1278
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Of course, there's a 2 there.

1279
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
It is the sequel to Espgaluda.

1280
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,160
And if you've never heard of it, that's because it's a shmup, it's a shoot-em-up.

1281
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:21,280
Very colorful, seizure-inducing graphics where most of your screen is taken up with an overlay

1282
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,800
because it's a vertical shooter.

1283
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:28,800
But you know there are some hardcore shmup fans out there, so I'm sure they'll be picking

1284
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,340
this up without delay.

1285
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:36,320
Also no fate, only the power of will comes out from Alchemist on February 25th on the

1286
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,320
Xbox 360.

1287
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:38,480
Not sure what this game's all about.

1288
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:43,060
Of course, it's got anime girls all over it, but this chick who's getting out of the pool

1289
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:44,060
is kind of angry.

1290
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:45,480
I don't know why she's so angry.

1291
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:46,480
She's getting out of the pool there.

1292
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,480
She looks like Utena.

1293
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:48,480
It's an adventure game.

1294
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,960
And then this other chick's just dreaming.

1295
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:53,040
But I like to think that maybe she is looking at the chick getting out of the pool and that's

1296
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,040
just making her angry.

1297
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,040
I don't know.

1298
01:00:55,040 --> 01:01:00,760
Anyhow, that made for a much funnier in-studio than it did radio, I apologize for that.

1299
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:01,760
Moving on.

1300
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:02,760
I snorted my root beer if that makes you feel better.

1301
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:03,760
It does, a little bit.

1302
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,440
And there is no curling in Deck of Sports DS.

1303
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:07,560
Fail.

1304
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,360
A million times fail.

1305
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:11,960
PlayStation 3, a price reduction on Demon's Souls.

1306
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,160
If you haven't picked that up yet, you really should.

1307
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,160
It's awesome.

1308
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:17,280
That's pretty much the only thing to look forward to on PlayStation 3 unless you need

1309
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:21,600
like some new HDMI cables because some third parties are putting some more of those out.

1310
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,440
But the Nintendo Wii has a lot this week, which is good because they've had some quiet

1311
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:28,480
weeks lately, including Arc Rise Fantasia is coming out.

1312
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,440
Ina no Susume selection, I think that might be just a price reduction then.

1313
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:35,040
I think, yeah, Arc Rise Fantasia I think has already been out.

1314
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:36,140
Just a price reduction there.

1315
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:38,040
It's kind of like a best hits over there.

1316
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:42,200
As far as new games go, Raji Ronnojia Wii.

1317
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:45,080
That's the sequel to Radarji.

1318
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,160
I don't know if I'm even saying that right.

1319
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,160
Radarji.

1320
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,160
Radarji.

1321
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:51,220
There's like an extra R in here.

1322
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:53,800
Another shmup basically, but this time on the Wii.

1323
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,760
Radio Allergy as it's called over here.

1324
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,320
Well the big thing about this one is that the final boss from the last game will now

1325
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:01,440
be a PC in this game.

1326
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,960
So you have shields and all that stuff.

1327
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:07,080
Co-op mode and lots of fun things for a shmup game.

1328
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:10,280
That again is on the Nintendo Wii.

1329
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:12,440
Checking out some other systems on the DS.

1330
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:18,280
Estpolis, The Lands Cursed by the Gods is coming out as well as Fushigi no Dungeon,

1331
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:22,320
Furai no Shirin 4, Kami no Hitomi no Akuma no Heiso.

1332
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,880
Yes, that is the entire name of the game.

1333
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,120
Mystery Dungeon.

1334
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,640
That is exactly I think what it is.

1335
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,080
No, it's a learning language.

1336
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,360
But Fushigi no Dungeon means Mystery Dungeon.

1337
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:34,840
So it's not Chocobo's Mystery Dungeon, it's just the mystery is this new language you're

1338
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:35,840
trying to learn.

1339
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:36,840
Let me see.

1340
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:44,560
I don't know if it's a, I don't know what language, but the guy's wearing a kind of

1341
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:45,560
a funny hat.

1342
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:46,560
He's got a monkey.

1343
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:50,720
It's the funny hat game featuring monkey.

1344
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,640
Also Super Robot Taisen OG Saga.

1345
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:55,200
There's a series we can't get rid of.

1346
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,200
That's right.

1347
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,200
It's never going away.

1348
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:03,800
And on the PSP, BlazBlue Portable comes out this week as well as Katekyo Hitman Reborn,

1349
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:07,200
Kizuna no Tag Battle, which is of course a fighting game.

1350
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,040
You can tell they're on the PSP.

1351
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:12,440
I'm not sure if this is based off an anime, but this is like, it looks like that one where

1352
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:16,400
you can do like four people at a time all playing at once.

1353
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,400
Looks like fun.

1354
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,800
That's going to do it for your Japanese release dates.

1355
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:28,120
For the UK, we have on the 23rd Metal Slug XX and then on the 25th Blue Toad Murder Files

1356
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:29,120
Episode 3.

1357
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:35,440
And then the 26th, we've got Heavy Rain, Lips Party Classics, Napoleon, Total War, Sonic

1358
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:39,080
and Sega All-Stars Racing and Undead Knights.

1359
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:44,080
I believe Metal Slug XX is coming out over here in the US as well.

1360
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:45,080
I love Metal Slug.

1361
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:47,000
I must have missed that.

1362
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,640
All right, let's do just a couple more stories and then we're going to get to the classic

1363
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:56,440
game of the week and I believe Dark Soccer has picked a true classic for you guys tonight.

1364
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:57,760
Better like it.

1365
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:01,920
You know, I picked the most piss your pants title I could think of.

1366
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:06,880
And it ties in with a game that we had coming out this week as well.

1367
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,760
We'll get there in a minute.

1368
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:15,880
So there's some new stuff coming out, not completely unexpected from THQ that they made

1369
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:16,880
announcements for.

1370
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:20,920
There's going to be a sequel to The Blob, which was actually a pretty cool game that

1371
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:23,360
came out before on the Wii.

1372
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:29,080
And this time, though, it's going to be branded under a new sci-fi channel brand, I guess,

1373
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:30,760
called Sci-Fi Kids.

1374
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:31,920
I don't know why they're...

1375
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,600
I didn't even know there were sci-fi kids.

1376
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,840
Do they make crappy children's shows, too?

1377
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:36,840
I didn't know.

1378
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:39,960
Well, they did like a Wizard of Oz and an Alice in Wonderland.

1379
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,040
Yeah, where two are all really like...

1380
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:43,680
They were like dark, weren't they?

1381
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:44,680
They were weird.

1382
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:45,680
Yeah.

1383
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,800
I don't know.

1384
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:54,440
So apparently, though, they're going to be working with the DiBlob character.

1385
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:57,280
Maybe there'll be a cartoon show, who knows?

1386
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:58,400
Will a Cylon show up?

1387
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:01,160
I mean, maybe there's Battlestar Galactica, Caprica.

1388
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,440
I don't think there's anything there.

1389
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,560
When I think of Sci-Fi Network, I think of BSG.

1390
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:06,560
I can't help it.

1391
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:09,080
I think of crappy sci-fi movies that are normally on there.

1392
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,080
That's true.

1393
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:11,080
What is that?

1394
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:12,080
Is that from Sci-Fi Network?

1395
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,080
The Shark Meat Octopus?

1396
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,080
Or what is it?

1397
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:15,080
The Flying Shark?

1398
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:17,080
The Flying Shark eats a plane out of the sky.

1399
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,080
Yes.

1400
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,080
Yeah.

1401
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:20,080
That's all those lovely sci-fi movies.

1402
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,480
Yeah, they show them on the soup all the time, right?

1403
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:22,480
Yeah.

1404
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,480
Oh, good times.

1405
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:24,480
With Deborah Gibson.

1406
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:25,480
Yes.

1407
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:26,880
Because, you know, she's a woman now, so no longer Debbie.

1408
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:27,880
That's right.

1409
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:33,160
And then the other thing, of course, DiBlob is also going to be not just on the Wii this

1410
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:34,160
time.

1411
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:38,600
It's also supposed to be coming to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1412
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:43,320
Also going to be some new Saints Rowan Red Faction at E3 this year.

1413
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:48,840
Of course, Saints Row 3 is not supposed to be coming out until 2011, which makes me very

1414
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:49,840
sad.

1415
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:54,280
But the new Red Faction game is supposed to be slated for later this year, so that might

1416
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:55,280
be cool.

1417
01:05:55,280 --> 01:06:01,240
And then, yeah, so I guess we'll have to wait until E3 to check those out.

1418
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:06,200
Okay, I have to go back to the sci-fi thing for a minute, because the Blob game, yeah,

1419
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,200
that's cool.

1420
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,240
I remember playing DiBlob at PAX a couple years ago, of all places.

1421
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,560
So, you know, and I remember Loki really enjoyed it too.

1422
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:16,080
So don't get me wrong, I'm glad that game is getting a sequel, if sci-fi is putting

1423
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,560
it out or however it's coming out.

1424
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:18,560
But seriously?

1425
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:19,560
It's still THQ, yeah.

1426
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:23,840
Why aren't they making, like, the shark and octopus video game?

1427
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:28,880
Like, when Alan was saying that sharks eat planes out of the sky, like, that sounds awesome.

1428
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,040
Because the movie was awful.

1429
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:36,520
But video games have plots that are about as good as a sci-fi movie, let's face it.

1430
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:40,120
I mean, if you could, like, buy a Wii game.

1431
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:43,880
Dark Sakura, wouldn't you want to play a video game on the Nintendo Wii?

1432
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:49,720
Just imagine a game where it's a shark, or no, an octopus that has eight tentacles, and

1433
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:52,040
all the tentacles are sharks.

1434
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:54,840
And you destroy things, and Debra Gibson does a voice.

1435
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:56,320
Wouldn't you want to buy that game?

1436
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:57,320
Fuck yes!

1437
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:58,320
See?

1438
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:02,240
Well, okay, they put out the Jaws game, which, granted, was awesome, because you could maybe-

1439
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,240
Fuck Jaws!

1440
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,240
I'm talking-

1441
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,960
Did Jaws eat a plane out of the sky?

1442
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:06,960
It could have.

1443
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,520
No, he chased around Richard Dreyfuss.

1444
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:09,520
Boo hoo.

1445
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,520
Yeah, shark.

1446
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:15,520
The guy's got one foot in the grave, come on.

1447
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:16,640
Did it have Debra Gibson?

1448
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,960
I don't think so.

1449
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,520
Chat room, am I crazy?

1450
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,160
Well, we knew that.

1451
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:27,040
No, I mean, for real about this, wouldn't you- Chat, would you or would you not want

1452
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:28,040
to play that game?

1453
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:32,960
ActDeft in chat says, President Cat versus Flying Shark Octopus.

1454
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:33,960
There you go.

1455
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:36,840
Dark Tetsuya says, screw President Cat, I want that game.

1456
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:40,640
Look, I am all about these low, what the fuck, random games.

1457
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:44,440
You ought to know that by now, listening to this show, unless it's your first time listening,

1458
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:47,120
which again, I apologize.

1459
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:48,120
What is that?

1460
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:49,120
Is that something someone linked to?

1461
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:52,200
Uncovering the secrets of Mega Shark, death in the skies.

1462
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:57,880
Hold on, SSJ, I hate to do this in the middle of the show, but SSJ100Matt is linking us

1463
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:01,800
to this YouTube, and just knowing SSJ100Matt, I think this is important.

1464
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:02,800
Yes.

1465
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,800
Holy shit.

1466
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:21,040
The shark is eating the plane.

1467
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,200
That needs to be on the end, and the birds fly away.

1468
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,160
Why is that not on the Wii?

1469
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:28,520
Why is that not being optioned for a video game?

1470
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:29,520
That's awesome.

1471
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,960
That was 50 kinds of awesome.

1472
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:34,240
It's so awful.

1473
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:38,160
You're only encouraging these people.

1474
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:43,760
Video games are kind of stupid, Loki, welcome, I mean, I realize there are some video games

1475
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:47,560
out there with deep plots and all this stuff, but come on.

1476
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:53,760
That just screams America, fuck yeah, shark's eating planes.

1477
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:57,000
I just like the scene dude looks out the window, shark!

1478
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:02,840
I assure you that watching the two seconds of that, you know, aren't necessarily as good

1479
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:06,760
as watching the full 90 minute movie.

1480
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:16,960
Imagine you're sitting down with a Nintendo Wii and then all of a sudden, holy shit!

1481
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,240
Why would a shark attack a plane?

1482
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:21,200
It makes no sense.

1483
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:25,960
Why do fighting characters decide to fight to the death and throw fireballs at each other

1484
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:28,960
and do spinning bird kicks and all the other bullshit?

1485
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:29,960
Come on!

1486
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:31,480
It's a video game.

1487
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:32,960
Sharks can eat planes.

1488
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:37,000
In fact, that should be in Street Fighter V.

1489
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,640
Maybe it could be in Civilization V, that's right, there is a Civilization V, how'd you

1490
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:41,640
like that transition?

1491
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:45,360
There is a Civilization V announced, it is coming fall of 2010.

1492
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:49,200
Of course, this made me squeak, you know I love my Civilization, I think Civilization

1493
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:53,760
I is like my favorite PC game they've ever made, but good old Sid Meier and Civilization

1494
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:59,440
series, a fifth installment coming out from 2K Games this fall, 2010.

1495
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:03,120
And I shouldn't be surprised at this news, although I have to admit this was news I kind

1496
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:07,640
of wasn't expecting, but then the news came out this week and I was like, fuck yeah, another

1497
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:08,640
Civilization!

1498
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:09,640
Cool!

1499
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:13,160
Like, I wasn't expecting it, but cool, because the fourth one was actually really good, it

1500
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:14,840
was probably my favorite next to the first one.

1501
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:17,720
But they are talking about it's going to be an all new engine, the biggest change, the

1502
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:22,100
most shocking change if you will, they have switched to hexagon tiles instead of square

1503
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:27,320
based tiles, it's now going to be hexagon, so think Catan meets Civilization, or Catanalization

1504
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,320
if you will, is what I'm calling this game.

1505
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:31,640
So there it is.

1506
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:35,900
It's going to have of course, the leaders will be all animated, and the landscapes will

1507
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:40,960
be all nice, and new combats, new diplomacy, and mods, mods, mods, because they are embracing

1508
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:43,000
of the mods community, which is very cool.

1509
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:47,240
Don't expect this to come out on consoles though, it's just, it's too much micromanaging

1510
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:50,040
in Civilization game, it really can't be done on a console.

1511
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:55,140
But of course there is Civ Revolution, which took some flack from Civ fans because it kind

1512
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:59,200
of dumbed down the series if you will, but I'll tell you what, I think Civ Revolution

1513
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:00,840
is a great introduction to the series.

1514
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:04,120
It's kind of like, I think it was an overlooked game on consoles, I think it's a lot of fun.

1515
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:07,760
I don't think it compares to the PC versions, but I think if you're just not much of a PC

1516
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:14,200
gamer, or a game that is low key on your console, go for it, Civ Network is pretty cool.

1517
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:18,680
So yeah, I'm looking forward to Civilization V.

1518
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:19,920
Gonna get your Civ on?

1519
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:24,320
Oh yeah, I might have to actually put down WoW to try this out for a little while.

1520
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:29,160
Alan, I know you play some PC games, you play like a pretty big mix of PC and console games,

1521
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,160
right?

1522
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,160
Yep.

1523
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:32,480
Do you play Civilization at all?

1524
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:33,480
Not really.

1525
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:34,480
I don't know if this is gonna work.

1526
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:39,840
No, but seriously though, you play a lot of shooter type games, right?

1527
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:40,840
Yeah.

1528
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,440
What kind of PC games are you into?

1529
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:45,400
Lots of first person shooters, like Bioshock and Half Life.

1530
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:51,760
As far as a game like Civ, I was really into Rise of Nations, which was sort of a Civ clone

1531
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:56,360
that came out by Big Huge Games under Microsoft's Game Studios label.

1532
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:59,040
So yeah, I played that.

1533
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,040
Very cool.

1534
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:08,280
All right, um, before we get to the classic game of the week, I was sent another YouTube

1535
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:10,480
from SSJ100Matt in private.

1536
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,680
I have to watch this.

1537
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:24,760
This is, um, the shark goes and eats the golden gate bridge just like that.

1538
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,280
During midday commute too.

1539
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:27,760
How rude of that shark.

1540
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,240
Pericacra.

1541
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:32,840
If that was in a video game.

1542
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:35,360
I won't play as the fucking shark.

1543
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:36,960
Exactly.

1544
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,920
That's why Jaws didn't sell Loki.

1545
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:41,320
Can Jaws eat the golden gate bridge?

1546
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,320
No.

1547
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:46,320
I think that he's tuned you out, Rob.

1548
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:49,480
When Loki is playing some game over there, it looks like it's like on the Atari 2600.

1549
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,000
It's gotta be homebrew of some sort.

1550
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Loki, what is it?

1551
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Speak up.

1552
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,480
What are you playing over there?

1553
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:55,480
It's Cream Wolf.

1554
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:56,480
What?

1555
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:57,480
Gross.

1556
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:01,120
What is it?

1557
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,120
What is?

1558
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:08,040
You're a werewolf ice cream guy and you have to make people fat so you can eat them.

1559
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:09,040
Okay.

1560
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:14,600
I'm thinking of a parody of a Shakira song already.

1561
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:16,160
Now I'm- Can I do my bit, Rob?

1562
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:18,280
I guess you can do your bit.

1563
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:22,160
You've been very patient and suffering through an hour and a half of OLR tonight.

1564
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:25,200
Actually, it's only an hour and 15 minutes, but we were here in the studio for quite a

1565
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,200
bit beforehand.

1566
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:28,400
Classic game of the week, et cetera, et cetera.

1567
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:32,400
Goes into the vault, finds a game, blah, blah, blah, picks one for you and it's great.

1568
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,400
Yeah?

1569
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:34,400
Yes.

1570
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:37,560
Our game of the week is Shenmue.

1571
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:38,560
Yay.

1572
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:39,560
Why?

1573
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:40,560
Yes.

1574
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,680
I would like to try a game of Lucky Hit.

1575
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:50,080
All I found was just the soundtrack stuff because really I was getting tired of listening

1576
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:52,520
to Rio talk.

1577
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:53,880
Asking about sailors.

1578
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:54,880
I know.

1579
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:55,880
The sailors one.

1580
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:58,200
I had to go back and watch that.

1581
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,200
Do you have sailors that come in here?

1582
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:06,600
Well, sometimes they come in at night, but they leave before it gets too late.

1583
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,240
The lady of months.

1584
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,240
Yeah.

1585
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:10,240
Anyway.

1586
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:17,000
Shenmue is one of the masterpieces of Yu Suzuki.

1587
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:27,480
It's really meant for interactive and to be a freeform environment and you have real life

1588
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:32,040
aspects like you go to bed, you get up in the morning, you pee, well, I don't know,

1589
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:36,720
they clearly don't show him peeing, but you can also go to vending machines and arcades

1590
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:45,280
and you can play classic games in the arcades, which is awesome, and he has a video game

1591
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:54,000
system in his house, he has convenience stores, so it's really open as for what you can do.

1592
01:14:54,000 --> 01:15:00,360
With the characters in there, basically the overall story is that Rio comes home and finds

1593
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:04,720
him beating up his dad and then he gets smacked around and then his dad tells him where to

1594
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:11,360
find something that he's looking for and the game goes from there.

1595
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:15,160
You go around and you're actually trying to track down this guy and trying to figure out

1596
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:20,760
what's going on and you have to talk to all the people and you have to do rescues and

1597
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:26,760
you have to go against these other guys, it's a big investigation, you know, and you just

1598
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:29,120
play as this guy.

1599
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:32,200
And you can also raise kittens.

1600
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,200
You can feed kittens.

1601
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,200
Oh well, I'm sold.

1602
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:38,200
They're cute little kittens.

1603
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:48,760
But the game was, there were little quick-time events that were in the game too, where you

1604
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:52,960
would witness something and you would have to hit the right button at the right time

1605
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:56,440
and that's how a lot of the fighting went too and then it would go along with the cut

1606
01:15:56,440 --> 01:16:01,760
scene and you had your little questing areas and you had your different battles and Rio

1607
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:08,360
could fight because his dad ran a dojo and of course he was going to teach his kid.

1608
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:14,240
The cool thing about this though is that it was supposed to be a killer app for the Saturn.

1609
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:16,400
That was the big thing about it.

1610
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:28,840
In fact, you can actually find online a video of the Saturn version, it was pretty sweet

1611
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:35,720
for Saturn at the time, but it was going to try to revive the Saturn, you know, but since

1612
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:40,840
the Dreamcast was coming out, they actually started working on Shenmue for, at the time

1613
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:43,320
it was Katana, remember?

1614
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:44,320
The working name?

1615
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,720
That's right, I remember that, yeah.

1616
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:50,840
And then, while it was being worked on, it was called Project Berkeley, so there were

1617
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:57,440
tech demos out under that name and then it went into actual production for Dreamcast

1618
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:06,320
and every character that you run into in the game has, they had voice actors for, in Japanese

1619
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:11,880
and English, a full orchestrated soundtrack.

1620
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:16,600
At that time, that level of voice acting was kind of unheard of too, that was pretty awesome

1621
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:17,600
I gotta say.

1622
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:24,680
And then it had a weather system in the game called the Magic Weather System, so when you

1623
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:31,520
go through the game you have different, you know, things that are happening but they actually

1624
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:38,440
were meant to reflect the actual weather conditions of Yokosuka at the time, which is where he

1625
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:45,800
lived in Japan, and it was set in the 1986, 1987, so you could actually go and explore

1626
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:48,800
different parts of town too.

1627
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,840
So this could have been happening concurrently with Karate Kid 2?

1628
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:52,840
Yes.

1629
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:53,840
Okay.

1630
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:59,760
I mean, you know, it's meant to be, you know, what Japan was like in the 80s in a little

1631
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:05,600
small town, you know, in the Japanese version you had Coca Cola stuff everywhere, which

1632
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:12,520
is funny, since Pepsi Japan, their big thing was with, Sega's big thing was with Pepsi.

1633
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:15,160
Do you remember they had Pepsi Man?

1634
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:21,680
I remember in the Crazy Taxi games you were going to all the Pepsi brand restaurants.

1635
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:26,880
But they actually put out a couple of games in Japan that were Pepsi Man.

1636
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:31,560
You could actually go on YouTube and look at the little commercials of Pepsi Man.

1637
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:35,760
So anyway, so I thought it was funny that, you know, they had Coca Cola for that one

1638
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:42,880
everywhere and, you know, and it was, you know, also with, they were trying to show

1639
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:47,200
exactly what, you know, people were like in that days, like the younger generation was

1640
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:49,720
going more towards a western look for things.

1641
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:53,880
So you had your older generation in one style and your younger generation in a different

1642
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:55,520
style.

1643
01:18:55,520 --> 01:19:03,800
And you also had a passport desk that you could go in and view the cut scenes for the

1644
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:08,040
movies, you could listen to the music, you had information so you could learn about other

1645
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:13,360
things going on in the game and the characters, you had the mini games you could replay, you

1646
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:17,920
had a free battle, just all kinds of interactive stuff.

1647
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:25,080
And then you could use the passport to get to Shenmue World through the Dreamcast internet.

1648
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:30,360
So it was, you know, just all kinds of, it had an online manual, network ranking for

1649
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:31,680
all your things.

1650
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:37,960
You could play with, you had VMU icons, you know, for your cute little VMU, collectible

1651
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:41,520
items like the toy capsules, you know, which would be like, you know, ships from other

1652
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:46,640
games that, I had an Oppa Oppa, you know, your data review.

1653
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:48,240
It was all kinds of stuff.

1654
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:53,480
And you can also track everything that you've done in the game from how long you've played

1655
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:59,280
to how long you've done the mini games to how many soft drinks you've bought.

1656
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:05,240
And it, of course, discontinued when they canceled Dreamcast production.

1657
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:14,600
And there was a sequel, of course, which was Shenmue 2, but because it didn't sell very

1658
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:19,200
well, you know, Shenmue or Shenmue 2, we didn't get any more story.

1659
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,200
That was it.

1660
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:23,960
And there's people still holding their breath for Shenmue 3.

1661
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:28,320
And I have a feeling that we might see it one day, but I like breathing.

1662
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:38,120
But, you know, they also did a figure that Dan showed me of Ryo driving a forklift.

1663
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:40,960
And there's also, he's in the Sega Racers game.

1664
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:41,960
Yes, he is.

1665
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:45,240
He's riding the motorbike and he also rides the forklift.

1666
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:52,800
But you can actually buy a figure, a recent figure that came out of Ryo riding a forklift.

1667
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:53,800
Can I admit something?

1668
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:54,800
Go for it.

1669
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:55,800
Never played this game.

1670
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:57,000
Well, I'd fix that.

1671
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,280
I've heard about how fascinating it is, but I just, you know, I even had a Dreamcast,

1672
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:02,320
but I just never really got around to playing this game.

1673
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,760
Would you like to borrow my copy?

1674
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:06,280
Would you like to play a game of Lucky Hit?

1675
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:08,800
That's all I know from the game.

1676
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:12,000
There's some video where the dude just goes around asking everybody that.

1677
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,880
And I kind of found it funny, so.

1678
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:16,760
But I've always heard about its epic epicness.

1679
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:18,560
You can play my copy if you want.

1680
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:20,680
I don't even know if my Dreamcast is hooked up.

1681
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:22,760
It's full of epic epicness, like you just said.

1682
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:23,760
All right.

1683
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,720
Shenmue, your classic game of the week.

1684
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:26,720
So there it is.

1685
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:27,720
All right.

1686
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:30,360
We're going to take a break here at Orange Lounge Radio, but we got plenty more to come

1687
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:33,560
tonight in part B. We got, of course, your phone calls and your Twitter topics.

1688
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:36,680
If you haven't sent in any Twitter topics, go ahead and get those in right now to at

1689
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:38,880
o-l-r on Twitter.

1690
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:42,080
We're going to get to the rapid fire news as well and then get to some other stories

1691
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:47,740
including the kind of a surprising new iPhone game as well as some of the dates and things

1692
01:21:47,740 --> 01:21:52,280
for the upcoming Xbox Live Block Party and some news on Fable 3.

1693
01:21:52,280 --> 01:22:02,640
We got all that coming up right after a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1694
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:06,600
And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday night, February

1695
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:08,440
the 21st of 2010.

1696
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:12,080
You are listening to that podcast where every gamer has a voice.

1697
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:16,920
And you might not know this, but we have an Olympic gold medal for being awesome.

1698
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:19,980
So we're going to talk about some more gaming news, of course, tonight.

1699
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:22,320
Join us if you're listening live at All Games Radio.

1700
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:26,760
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to be as you are listening live on this Sunday.

1701
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:29,520
If you've never listened live before, you really should join us sometime.

1702
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:32,160
It's kind of a different show when you're listening live.

1703
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:34,700
And as Alan is finding out tonight, it's a really different show when you're sitting

1704
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:35,700
here in studio.

1705
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:36,700
Correct?

1706
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:37,700
Yes.

1707
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:38,700
Yes.

1708
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:39,700
What was the comparison you were making earlier during the break?

1709
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:40,700
I don't even know if you want to share it.

1710
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:41,700
But it was funny.

1711
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:42,700
I laughed.

1712
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:43,700
No, that's all right.

1713
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:44,700
Are you sure?

1714
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:45,700
Yeah.

1715
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:46,700
I'm good.

1716
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:47,700
Because I'll try to tell it.

1717
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:48,700
It won't be as funny.

1718
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:49,700
Cheers.

1719
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:50,700
Thanks a lot.

1720
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:51,700
Nice.

1721
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:52,700
All right.

1722
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:53,700
Let's go ahead and get back into some gaming news and, of course, Twitter topics coming

1723
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:54,700
up.

1724
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:55,700
So be sure to get those in.

1725
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:57,600
So quick stories real quick, Logie.

1726
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:58,600
Yes.

1727
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:05,400
There's a cool fan made 8-bit-esque Mega Man first person shooter game that someone's made

1728
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:07,860
called Mega Man 8-bit Deathmatch.

1729
01:23:07,860 --> 01:23:12,700
And it features some of the original Mega Man characters and their kind of 8-bit glory.

1730
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:16,500
It's kind of almost like a Doom mod, but I don't think it is.

1731
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:18,360
And yeah, it's really sweet.

1732
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:25,500
You can actually check it out on, I believe it's cutstuff.net is where you can find that

1733
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,000
to download.

1734
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,220
And apparently it's free.

1735
01:23:28,220 --> 01:23:30,380
At least they have a trailer of it and stuff.

1736
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:35,860
I'm not sure when it's actually being released, but it's pretty cool.

1737
01:23:35,860 --> 01:23:37,060
Yeah.

1738
01:23:37,060 --> 01:23:38,860
Anyways.

1739
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:41,740
So other things that are pretty cool.

1740
01:23:41,740 --> 01:23:46,500
There's a lot of stuff out there that are allowing you to buy a game and get something

1741
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:47,500
else for free.

1742
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:50,540
For example, last week we talked about how if you were one of the people that bought

1743
01:23:50,540 --> 01:23:54,860
Darksiders, you would get a code for a free Red Faction game.

1744
01:23:54,860 --> 01:24:00,980
Well, if you didn't happen to keep your mystery code with your copy of Darksiders, fear not.

1745
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:07,020
You can still redeem a free copy of Red Faction Guerrilla, assuming that you have a copy of

1746
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:12,300
your receipt and some other stuff that they want you to send them copies of.

1747
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:17,660
And with that you will get a free copy of Red Faction Guerrilla and a digital art book.

1748
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:24,940
Also another kind of bonus THQ is handing out, with people that pre-ordered Dawn of

1749
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:30,620
War 2, the expansion to the Warhammer franchise, you will be able to get Saints Row 2 on PC

1750
01:24:30,620 --> 01:24:34,100
for free, which is pretty cool.

1751
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:37,500
And then of course THQ isn't the only ones doing that.

1752
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:41,620
For Battlefield Bad Company 2 on PC, if you happen to pre-order your copy through the

1753
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:49,460
EA store, you will net yourself a free copy of Battlefield 2142 as well.

1754
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:58,420
And then finally, if you happen not to play PC games and maybe bought a PSP Go, during

1755
01:24:58,420 --> 01:25:05,380
the last few weeks here, you'll be able to redeem, I guess, a free copy of Assassin's

1756
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:09,540
Creed Bloodlines or Little Big Planet for PSP.

1757
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:16,260
And to do this, you have to redeem it between February 18th and March 21st.

1758
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:20,020
Wait, so that's like if you just buy a new PSP Go, you can get one of those games for

1759
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:21,020
free?

1760
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:22,020
Yeah, during this time.

1761
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:23,020
Hmm.

1762
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:25,140
I guess they're trying to finally make it worth some of the money they're asking for

1763
01:25:25,140 --> 01:25:26,140
it.

1764
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:27,140
Yeah, so that's kinda cool.

1765
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:28,140
Alrighty.

1766
01:25:28,140 --> 01:25:34,860
And then finally, there was a contest that was being held for modders for Unreal Tournament

1767
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:41,620
3, and Epic has released the winners of the Make Something Unreal Contest, and several

1768
01:25:41,620 --> 01:25:45,100
mod teams created a bunch of different mods for it.

1769
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:47,780
The winning mod was a game called The Hunted.

1770
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:52,220
It was a third-person survivor horror action game that kinda looked like a Wild West version

1771
01:25:52,220 --> 01:25:53,900
of Left 4 Dead.

1772
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:58,900
As the winner of the contest, the team will receive $50,000 and a commercial license for

1773
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:03,580
the Unreal Engine, meaning the team can actually make an Unreal Engine title as a commercial

1774
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:05,460
product.

1775
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:09,380
And that'd be pretty awesome looking.

1776
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:11,860
So I'd watch a trailer for this and it's sweet.

1777
01:26:11,860 --> 01:26:18,240
Some of the other winners, second place was The Ball from Toltec Studios.

1778
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:25,420
Third place, Angels Fall First by Plantstorm, and it's the Plantstorm team, they won $30,000.

1779
01:26:25,420 --> 01:26:32,480
Fourth place, Prometheus, and also the Prometheus team, they won $20,000.

1780
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:36,260
And it looks like fifth place won $10,000, with Hazard, A Journey of Life.

1781
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:38,900
And they had some other categories as well.

1782
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:41,020
Lots of money being given away though.

1783
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:43,740
That's pretty cool.

1784
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:47,340
So yeah, hopefully we'll look forward to seeing that.

1785
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:52,140
Alright, well I have some quick topics for you guys here, and one of them has to do with

1786
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:55,940
a game that's unlikely to...

1787
01:26:55,940 --> 01:26:59,420
It's not one you would think is as played as it is, but what does WoW have?

1788
01:26:59,420 --> 01:27:02,580
World of Warcraft's got, what, 11, maybe 12 million players on it?

1789
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:03,580
I think that's about right.

1790
01:27:03,580 --> 01:27:06,460
I think Warcraft is probably one of the biggest MMOs of that many people.

1791
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:09,860
What if I told you there was a game with about seven times as many players on it playing

1792
01:27:09,860 --> 01:27:11,340
right now?

1793
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:12,340
It's Farmville.

1794
01:27:12,340 --> 01:27:15,860
Yeah, that's right, there's a new story circulating game blogs this week.

1795
01:27:15,860 --> 01:27:16,860
I hate that game.

1796
01:27:16,860 --> 01:27:22,620
Farmville has passed 80 million users, 80 million.

1797
01:27:22,620 --> 01:27:24,300
That's like a country, okay?

1798
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:25,940
That is a huge amount of people playing Farmville.

1799
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:30,380
Now I don't know if that necessarily means people regularly playing Farmville, because

1800
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:31,380
I know...

1801
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:33,620
Okay, look, I'll admit, I tried it out many months ago.

1802
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:34,620
Don't judge me.

1803
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:37,100
I tried it out many months ago just because I had friends that were playing, and you know

1804
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:40,420
you get so much spam on your Facebook, you're like, well gee, if so many of my friends are

1805
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:41,900
playing it, there must be something about it.

1806
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:46,660
Yeah, I played it for about, not even a month, maybe two weeks, and it was like, what?

1807
01:27:46,660 --> 01:27:47,900
What am I doing?

1808
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:48,900
This is ridiculous.

1809
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:53,500
Yeah, so Farmville, of course, 80 million people playing Farmville.

1810
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:58,620
Look, whether you love or hate Farmville, it certainly goes to show that Facebook as

1811
01:27:58,620 --> 01:28:00,620
a gaming platform should not be discounted.

1812
01:28:00,620 --> 01:28:02,220
I mean, that is a huge amount of people.

1813
01:28:02,220 --> 01:28:06,060
No word as to how many spam messages those 80 million people have sent their friends

1814
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:07,060
about.

1815
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:11,180
I don't know, sign up for this and get a million farm bucks or whatever it is, I don't know,

1816
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:14,900
so I can get a super cow to make lots of milk or whatever they do.

1817
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:15,900
Super cow.

1818
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:16,900
Super cow.

1819
01:28:16,900 --> 01:28:18,700
I see all this bullshit all the time.

1820
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:23,260
I get all these group invites like, join me now in Farmville so I can get my honeycomb

1821
01:28:23,260 --> 01:28:24,260
or whatever.

1822
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:25,260
I hid all of those.

1823
01:28:25,260 --> 01:28:26,260
Oh my gosh.

1824
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:28,380
No, I get like group invites to my email.

1825
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:29,500
I mean, ugh.

1826
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:33,660
I just report him for abuse every time.

1827
01:28:33,660 --> 01:28:34,660
I just get irritated.

1828
01:28:34,660 --> 01:28:39,140
But see, yeah, I mean, actdeft in chat room brings up a good point, Bejeweled Blitz greater

1829
01:28:39,140 --> 01:28:40,520
than Farmville.

1830
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:43,540
I will admit, I still play Bejeweled Blitz like a lot.

1831
01:28:43,540 --> 01:28:45,180
Like Alan, you watched me play the other day.

1832
01:28:45,180 --> 01:28:47,380
Like I was like, oh, I gotta get my score in for the week because I want to get entered

1833
01:28:47,380 --> 01:28:49,020
in for a laptop.

1834
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:55,900
And uh, yeah, I have Bejeweled Blitz on my phone and well, you know, like they put Lexulus

1835
01:28:55,900 --> 01:29:00,580
on there, which is my Scrabble game and I do Scrabble solitaire on it.

1836
01:29:00,580 --> 01:29:02,380
That's right now the only game I still play.

1837
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:07,900
I mean, I still have a pet society, but I mean, seriously, all the other of those games

1838
01:29:07,900 --> 01:29:09,540
are just completely ridiculous.

1839
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:11,020
Like sorority life.

1840
01:29:11,020 --> 01:29:12,580
I rolled my eyes out.

1841
01:29:12,580 --> 01:29:13,580
Guilty.

1842
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:14,580
I know.

1843
01:29:14,580 --> 01:29:15,580
Guilty.

1844
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:18,940
But I'm saying that the, you know, I quit that too.

1845
01:29:18,940 --> 01:29:25,140
I've tried some of them and I tried Farmville and I finally actually told people before

1846
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:30,760
they had the hide, you know, all things from this application to just stop including me

1847
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:32,680
on their little announcements.

1848
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:37,120
You know, I would hunt down people and tell them, dis-include me.

1849
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:40,860
Now there's a Facebook group that's like, I don't give a hoot or I don't give a shit

1850
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:44,540
about your mafia, your farm or your, I don't remember what it is.

1851
01:29:44,540 --> 01:29:45,540
I joined that.

1852
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:46,540
Or your sorority.

1853
01:29:46,540 --> 01:29:50,500
And then I'm kind of like, now that I'm watching all these people join this group, like it's

1854
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:51,500
just funny.

1855
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:53,580
The way Facebook works is interesting.

1856
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:54,580
Of course.

1857
01:29:54,580 --> 01:29:59,260
My favorite of those groups is still, I bet this pickle can get more fans than Nickelback.

1858
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:04,980
Wasn't there one that's like, I bet this more, this mobius strip can get more fans than itself.

1859
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:07,140
I saw a group called that or what.

1860
01:30:07,140 --> 01:30:08,140
There was another one.

1861
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:09,140
I don't know.

1862
01:30:09,140 --> 01:30:11,020
There was one you joined this week or was that just a status update?

1863
01:30:11,020 --> 01:30:16,500
Alan, you put like, I bet that X can get more fans than Y or I don't remember what it said.

1864
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:17,500
Something.

1865
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:18,500
Yes.

1866
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:21,660
I bet this at VAR can get more fans than pound foo.

1867
01:30:21,660 --> 01:30:23,140
Like just variables.

1868
01:30:23,140 --> 01:30:24,140
Programming joke.

1869
01:30:24,140 --> 01:30:25,140
Yes.

1870
01:30:25,140 --> 01:30:26,140
Got it.

1871
01:30:26,140 --> 01:30:27,140
That's a very high level nerd joke.

1872
01:30:27,140 --> 01:30:28,140
That might be too high brow for the show.

1873
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:29,140
Actually.

1874
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:30,140
I don't know.

1875
01:30:30,140 --> 01:30:31,620
You might, you need to, you need to tone it down with some Dick and fart jokes.

1876
01:30:31,620 --> 01:30:34,860
Oh, Hey, uh, Starcraft two.

1877
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:37,580
Hey, no better way to bring it to gaming than talk about Starcraft two.

1878
01:30:37,580 --> 01:30:38,580
Of course.

1879
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:40,380
As you, I'm sure you've heard many other places.

1880
01:30:40,380 --> 01:30:45,780
The beta launched this week and uh, yeah, lots of people very eager to get in this game.

1881
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:47,460
How eager are they?

1882
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:54,960
So eager that they are paying up to $300 for Starcraft two beta keys to get into this game.

1883
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:59,060
This is a, some of the tickets that were handed out at Blizzcon 2008 apparently.

1884
01:30:59,060 --> 01:31:03,860
Um, now they are selling for $300 as high as four 50 they've been spotted.

1885
01:31:03,860 --> 01:31:04,860
Wow.

1886
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:07,300
I mean, uh, don't get me wrong.

1887
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:11,500
I think Starcraft two is going to be kind of cool, but not $450 cool, dude.

1888
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:14,580
I can wait like a month for the finished product or not a month, three months for the finished

1889
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:15,580
product.

1890
01:31:15,580 --> 01:31:19,380
That's even a lot of good news at Blizzard camp.

1891
01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:23,860
Uh, right now though, Blizzard also this week has announced that their pandaren campaign,

1892
01:31:23,860 --> 01:31:24,860
that's right.

1893
01:31:24,860 --> 01:31:28,540
They were selling in game pets and world of Warcraft for 10 bucks to fundraise money for

1894
01:31:28,540 --> 01:31:29,540
the make a wish foundation.

1895
01:31:29,540 --> 01:31:30,540
Yeah, I bought one.

1896
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:31,540
Shut up.

1897
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:32,540
Don't judge me.

1898
01:31:32,540 --> 01:31:34,500
Hey, I helped contribute to a cause that overall raised.

1899
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:41,300
They are announcing $1.1 million was raised by the pandaren monks.

1900
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:45,340
And uh, that was such a big donation was actually reported in the OC register, which is a pretty

1901
01:31:45,340 --> 01:31:50,100
big, uh, um, newspaper in orange County, which you may know or not know.

1902
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:54,100
That's where Blizzard is headquartered, which you also may not know about orange, orange

1903
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:55,100
County.

1904
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:59,640
I believe there is an art gallery there called the orange lounge that if you Google like

1905
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:03,580
orange lounge, I think you put, I don't know if you put orange laundry or just like orange

1906
01:32:03,580 --> 01:32:05,660
lounge, you get that in your results.

1907
01:32:05,660 --> 01:32:08,420
Just kind of a lol what type of moment.

1908
01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:13,500
Uh, anyhow, the pandaren monks are still on sale, but you should know they are no longer

1909
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:16,100
going towards the make a wish foundation.

1910
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:18,140
That was just a limited time thing.

1911
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:22,140
Hey, if you look up dark Sakura on Google, you get my deviant art page.

1912
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:23,140
Do you really?

1913
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:24,140
Yeah, you do.

1914
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:25,140
Interesting.

1915
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:26,580
I don't know what happens if you look up Rob Roberts.

1916
01:32:26,580 --> 01:32:30,920
I think you just get some random old guy cause like I did a picture search and I wasn't even

1917
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:32,180
on page one, but that's okay.

1918
01:32:32,180 --> 01:32:36,380
I like, I like being a little bit of an image that comes up is of some girl that says dark

1919
01:32:36,380 --> 01:32:37,380
Sakura.

1920
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:38,380
Well, you're fucked.

1921
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:42,020
The second picture is me, um, seven years ago.

1922
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:43,020
Oh wow.

1923
01:32:43,020 --> 01:32:45,300
I just think it was funny cause I like randomly doing that.

1924
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:46,300
So let's see what we get on.

1925
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:50,740
I'm going to actually do a search for orange lounge.

1926
01:32:50,740 --> 01:32:53,820
You have some rapid fire news stories to be reading young lady.

1927
01:32:53,820 --> 01:32:54,820
Yes I do.

1928
01:32:54,820 --> 01:32:56,420
And by the way, I found the orange lounge.

1929
01:32:56,420 --> 01:32:57,420
Nice.

1930
01:32:57,420 --> 01:33:05,100
So anyway, um, yeah, with, uh, the stuff I have, we've got, um, rock band releases coming

1931
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:14,100

1933
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:19,980

01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:47,500
any of the music games.

1940
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:51,900
The only one that I care about is, uh, here I go again because I mean, I'm sorry, that

1941
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:54,580
song is just awesome.

1942
01:33:54,580 --> 01:34:02,020
And then, um, AXIS, um, is, uh, bringing back the Kunio-kun series.

We um, they are going to be, um, localizing Kunio-kun no Cho Nekketsu Dayan Dokai, which

1944
01:34:10,620 --> 01:34:13,460
is Kunio's extreme hot-blooded athletic meet.

1945
01:34:13,460 --> 01:34:17,620
And for those who do not know, the Kunio games are the river city games.

1946
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:22,280
So they are actually adopting the river city name to release these under.

1947
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:27,320
So we get river city super sports challenge and river city soccer hooligans, river city

1961
01:34:54,580 --> 01:34:55,900
issues here as well?

1962
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:58,260
Uh, I believe the studio is on Comcast, right?

1963
01:34:58,260 --> 01:34:59,260
Yup.

1964
01:34:59,260 --> 01:35:02,060
In fact, I think Comcast in the Sacramento area is really one of the only options.

1965
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:07,440
There's another provider called SureWest for parts of like, they suck here west Sacramento

1966
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:08,440
ish.

1967
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:10,420
I think they're really popular, but not a lot here.

1968
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:13,500
And um, the U-verse I don't think really exists here.

1969
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:14,700
Yeah, we don't have U-verse.

1970
01:35:14,700 --> 01:35:17,860
I tried to look, I looked up all of those for my new apartment cause I want to, you

1971
01:35:17,860 --> 01:35:20,100
know, competitively price and see who can give me the best deal.

1972
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:25,220
Comcast was my only option, but it looks like the internet's running fine now.

1973
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:26,220
So whatever.

1974
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:32,840
Um, let's see, uh, got a message from alpha Kananagram that's, uh, pointed us to this

1975
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:34,980
news story, uh, on joystick.

1976
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:39,340
I want to make sure this isn't coming up later in the show cause I didn't familiarize myself

1977
01:35:39,340 --> 01:35:43,900
very well with the show world tonight, but it has to do with Nippon Ichi.

1978
01:35:43,900 --> 01:35:48,660
The president over there is going to be resigning apparently at the March 31st.

1979
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:53,580
Nippon Ichi president Tomohiro Sato said that he is stepping down from his managerial post

1980
01:35:53,580 --> 01:35:55,300
on March 31st.

1981
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:59,240
He's saying it is because of personal reasons, but just a coincidence.

1982
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:03,900
It happens to be that Nippon Ichi recently announced that they are facing a big financial

1983
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:04,900
decline.

1984
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:05,900
Uh-oh.

1985
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:06,900
Yeah.

1986
01:36:06,900 --> 01:36:10,740
The personal reason is, uh, I got to get off the sinking ship quick.

1987
01:36:10,740 --> 01:36:13,480
Hopefully things are able to turn around there.

1988
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:17,620
And also another tweet to us from actdeft saying, can someone buy me this please?

1989
01:36:17,620 --> 01:36:21,580
And he links us to a story on Kotaku that talks about pre-ordering the Final Fantasy

1990
01:36:21,580 --> 01:36:25,860
13 soundtrack, 85 tracks on four CDs.

1991
01:36:25,860 --> 01:36:29,100
Uh, you can also get that on the North American Squeenix store.

1992
01:36:29,100 --> 01:36:32,900
I'm sure it's going to be available through iTunes as well, but what a nice little collector's

1993
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:34,340
edition that would make.

1994
01:36:34,340 --> 01:36:36,340
So there you go.

1995
01:36:36,340 --> 01:36:37,340
Nice.

1996
01:36:37,340 --> 01:36:39,060
I don't know.

1997
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:41,700
I haven't really heard a lot of the music from Final Fantasy 13 yet.

1998
01:36:41,700 --> 01:36:45,340
Just the Leona Lewis song, but that's because that's on her CD anyway.

1999
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:47,200
So you can hear the little clip on iTunes.

2000
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:50,080
So I haven't really heard the actual music music from the game yet.

2001
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:55,580
So, but I did see of all places I saw on Oh No They Didn't this week, which if you've

2002
01:36:55,580 --> 01:36:59,420
never heard of Oh No They Didn't, Alan, help me describe Oh No They Didn't.

2003
01:36:59,420 --> 01:37:00,540
You've been a member longer than I have.

2004
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:01,580
How would you describe it?

2005
01:37:01,580 --> 01:37:03,500
It's the largest community on LiveJournal.

2006
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:08,820
It's so, it's so large that during, um, major news events, it'll actually crash the site

2007
01:37:08,820 --> 01:37:13,060
for one community that's totally nonprofit and they don't make any money off of it, but

2008
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:15,700
it's just celebrity gossip and media news.

2009
01:37:15,700 --> 01:37:17,780
So it's just, you know, celeb lols basically.

2010
01:37:17,780 --> 01:37:18,780
Yeah.

2011
01:37:18,780 --> 01:37:22,180
Uh, and lots of great animated gifts are the whole reason to be on Oh No They Didn't.

2012
01:37:22,180 --> 01:37:25,000
You find the best animated gifts you're going to find anywhere on the internet there.

2013
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:29,180
So anyway, um, Oh No They Didn't had a story about somebody posted the actual video on

2014
01:37:29,180 --> 01:37:36,500
YouTube of Leona Lewis playing Final Fantasy 13 and it was kind of awkward to look at like,

2015
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:40,860
you know, she's really cute and everything, but her lines sounded really fed.

2016
01:37:40,860 --> 01:37:44,540
Like I don't, let me see if I can find that video really quick, um, before we get to the

2017
01:37:44,540 --> 01:37:48,580
next news story here, maybe I'll have Loki do a new story real quick while I try to find

2018
01:37:48,580 --> 01:37:53,060
the video and then I'll come back to this cause it's, you got to hear this cause I don't

2019
01:37:53,060 --> 01:37:54,060
know.

2020
01:37:54,060 --> 01:37:58,700
Like as, as, as precious as Leona Lewis is, I can't really think of a good verb or adjective

2021
01:37:58,700 --> 01:38:04,420
to describe Leona Lewis, but a precious, what seems to be one, uh, her lines sound really

2022
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:05,420
forced.

2023
01:38:05,420 --> 01:38:07,320
So I've got, I got to try this.

2024
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:09,820
By the way, uh, Kuma JP in chat is saying quite good.

2025
01:38:09,820 --> 01:38:11,420
Apparently the music is quite good.

2026
01:38:11,420 --> 01:38:17,060
So chat at orange on radio.com you want me to go ahead and do this story where I try

2027
01:38:17,060 --> 01:38:21,640
to find that YouTube, um, to kind of go back to what we talked about last week with the

2028
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:26,580
Xbox live arcade block party, um, got some pretty good games coming out during the month

2029
01:38:26,580 --> 01:38:27,580
of March.

2030
01:38:27,580 --> 01:38:32,260
Um, now we do have dates for all of them, so you can plan accordingly.

2031
01:38:32,260 --> 01:38:37,740
And to recap, uh, March 3rd, we're going to see the release of toys soldiers for 1200

2032
01:38:37,740 --> 01:38:41,580
Microsoft points or $15 in real money a week after that.

2033
01:38:41,580 --> 01:38:47,260
So March 10th, we'll have a scrap metal, which is kind of a top down racing game.

2034
01:38:47,260 --> 01:38:51,660
No one really care though, because that's the same week as I believe final fantasy 13.

2035
01:38:51,660 --> 01:38:57,060
Um, and that's also 1200 Microsoft points or $15 on March 17th.

2036
01:38:57,060 --> 01:39:05,700
Uh, there will be the, um, perfect dark, uh, Xbox live arcade game coming out for $10 or

2037
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:11,880
800 Microsoft points, and then finally, of course, as expected, uh, March 24th, the game

2038
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:14,740
room hub will be available, uh, for no charge.

2039
01:39:14,740 --> 01:39:21,340
Of course, the games will run on their 400 Microsoft points or $5 for a PC and Xbox 360

2040
01:39:21,340 --> 01:39:22,500
friendly version.

2041
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:28,740
Or if you want to license them for one system, 240 Microsoft points or 40 Microsoft points

2042
01:39:28,740 --> 01:39:30,980
for a single play.

2043
01:39:30,980 --> 01:39:32,780
I am so excited about game room though.

2044
01:39:32,780 --> 01:39:33,780
I think it's going to be fun.

2045
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:37,220
And I, and I hope there'll be people that want to have competitions on the old school

2046
01:39:37,220 --> 01:39:38,220
games with me.

2047
01:39:38,220 --> 01:39:41,980
Cause I think I'll buy some of them, but I'm not going to buy like, I'm definitely not

2048
01:39:41,980 --> 01:39:43,740
buying all the games that I've had.

2049
01:39:43,740 --> 01:39:44,740
Definitely.

2050
01:39:44,740 --> 01:39:45,740
No, I refuse.

2051
01:39:45,740 --> 01:39:48,220
I will not buy a game that was already out on Xbox live.

2052
01:39:48,220 --> 01:39:51,180
Although I will ask this cause I don't see a story on this anywhere else.

2053
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:52,420
And I read this earlier this week.

2054
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:55,900
Did you hear about how apparently some of the midway games have disappeared from Xbox

2055
01:39:55,900 --> 01:40:00,940
live completely, uh, joust and smash TV, like pretty much anything that was connected to

2056
01:40:00,940 --> 01:40:01,940
midway gauntlet.

2057
01:40:01,940 --> 01:40:02,940
Oh, they're gone.

2058
01:40:02,940 --> 01:40:03,940
They're gone.

2059
01:40:03,940 --> 01:40:04,940
They're not on Xbox live.

2060
01:40:04,940 --> 01:40:05,940
You cannot buy them now.

2061
01:40:05,940 --> 01:40:09,420
Now they swear up and down, or at least on major Nelson's blog, it swears nothing to

2062
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:10,460
do with game room.

2063
01:40:10,460 --> 01:40:11,860
It's a licensing thing.

2064
01:40:11,860 --> 01:40:14,900
And maybe that has to do with like the Warner brothers acquisition, but I don't know.

2065
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:18,060
I kind of look at that and go, okay, uh huh, sure.

2066
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:20,160
I think it has to do with midway being gone.

2067
01:40:20,160 --> 01:40:24,140
I think that's what it is because now, but seriously, if Joe shows up on game room, aren't

2068
01:40:24,140 --> 01:40:28,660
you going to be like, you just get, I'm sorry, I gave a visual, but aren't you just kind

2069
01:40:28,660 --> 01:40:32,660
of like hanging around to go really not going to be really, I don't think that's the reason

2070
01:40:32,660 --> 01:40:33,660
why.

2071
01:40:33,660 --> 01:40:37,420
I mean, first off, I can't imagine those games are really popular right now as far as purchases

2072
01:40:37,420 --> 01:40:38,420
go.

2073
01:40:38,420 --> 01:40:39,420
But they're classic.

2074
01:40:39,420 --> 01:40:40,780
I mean, smash TV is a classic.

2075
01:40:40,780 --> 01:40:46,800
I understand that, but you know, at the same time, I guess maybe they could be doing that,

2076
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:49,940
but it, I don't think it's going to matter because there's going to be Pac-Man and the

2077
01:40:49,940 --> 01:40:54,780
Namco games aren't going away on, you know, Xbox live arcade, Konami games, I don't know.

2078
01:40:54,780 --> 01:40:55,780
Konami games.

2079
01:40:55,780 --> 01:40:56,780
Frogger.

2080
01:40:56,780 --> 01:40:57,780
We'll always have Frogger.

2081
01:40:57,780 --> 01:40:59,900
So I don't, you know, great.

2082
01:40:59,900 --> 01:41:03,260
Um, so I don't doubt that.

2083
01:41:03,260 --> 01:41:08,100
I don't think that's the reason why is that, you know, because they're putting them on,

2084
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:11,540
on that service, but well, we'll see.

2085
01:41:11,540 --> 01:41:16,340
Uh, and I, I, I, good question from act JEFT in our chat room, Joust, then what will happen

2086
01:41:16,340 --> 01:41:18,780
with those Xbox live 12 month game codes?

2087
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:22,460
I guess they're screwed or maybe you'll get the point.

2088
01:41:22,460 --> 01:41:28,940
Well, the first off, so you know, the Xbox live 12 month game codes that are, you know,

2089
01:41:28,940 --> 01:41:30,340
that come with free games and stuff.

2090
01:41:30,340 --> 01:41:32,140
Um, I think they switched out those games.

2091
01:41:32,140 --> 01:41:33,140
Yeah.

2092
01:41:33,140 --> 01:41:34,660
They probably switched out Joust a long time ago.

2093
01:41:34,660 --> 01:41:36,340
They do new versions all the time.

2094
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:40,700
And the same thing, you know, they may be off the marketplace, but those codes may still

2095
01:41:40,700 --> 01:41:41,760
redeem it.

2096
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:45,000
And if you've already downloaded it and need to redownload it again, they're still up there.

2097
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
So they're on their servers.

2098
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Yeah.

2099
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,020
And your game doesn't stop working just because it's gone.

2100
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:53,340
So it, it, it may not matter that those game codes are in there.

2101
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:55,700
Do you know how many of those freaking games I bought?

2102
01:41:55,700 --> 01:41:59,220
Like I think what I want to do tomorrow is just go in when I have internet again, I'm

2103
01:41:59,220 --> 01:42:03,600
going to go in and actually just play Joust and Smash TV and all those games you can't

2104
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:09,100
get anymore just to fill up my gamer card to go, nah, nah, nah, I have them cause I'm

2105
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:10,100
weird.

2106
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:11,100
All right.

2107
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:13,460
Uh, let's go back to something I was mentioning earlier.

2108
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:16,860
This video is only a minute 13 so I'm going to go ahead and play it in studio.

2109
01:42:16,860 --> 01:42:23,140
This is Leona Lewis talking about Final Fantasy 13 and this is on YouTube user Gamerspawn,

2110
01:42:23,140 --> 01:42:27,460
although I'm guessing he probably just stole it from the, uh, official Squeenix YouTube,

2111
01:42:27,460 --> 01:42:29,260
but this is just who I'm playing it from.

2112
01:42:29,260 --> 01:42:30,700
So whatever.

2113
01:42:30,700 --> 01:42:31,700
So here it is.

2114
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:33,700
Leona Lewis talking about Final Fantasy 13.

2115
01:42:33,700 --> 01:42:38,780
There's a little, here we go.

2116
01:42:38,780 --> 01:42:40,780
Pretty amazing.

2117
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:42,780
graphics are insane.

2118
01:42:42,780 --> 01:42:57,140
She just did this little like, yes thing with her little hand, like a little fist.

2119
01:42:57,140 --> 01:43:00,780
Like I don't know how many times I've been playing Final Fantasy where I went, yes, but

2120
01:43:00,780 --> 01:43:02,180
that couldn't have looked any more forced.

2121
01:43:02,180 --> 01:43:06,420
I just, just point out, I have to say I have though thrown down my controller and gone

2122
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:07,780
out for fuck's sake.

2123
01:43:07,780 --> 01:43:08,780
Exactly.

2124
01:43:08,780 --> 01:43:09,780
That's what I want.

2125
01:43:09,780 --> 01:43:10,780
That's what I want to see.

2126
01:43:10,780 --> 01:43:23,780
I want her to throw her controller at the window like fucking monster will be funny.

2127
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:24,780
What do you want to bet?

2128
01:43:24,780 --> 01:43:27,620
Like she might be holding the controller, but somebody else off camera is holding the

2129
01:43:27,620 --> 01:43:33,260
real controller and playing the game so they can show her playing the game.

2130
01:43:33,260 --> 01:43:34,260
Cool.

2131
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:35,260
Cool.

2132
01:43:35,260 --> 01:43:36,260
Amazing.

2133
01:43:36,260 --> 01:43:41,060
I don't know until I run around the land all day.

2134
01:43:41,060 --> 01:43:42,060
Hi everyone.

2135
01:43:42,060 --> 01:43:45,700
I'm thrilled to be collaborating with Square Enix on such a groundbreaking game.

2136
01:43:45,700 --> 01:43:51,060
I never would have imagined my hands as such a perfect fit for Final Fantasy 13, but the

2137
01:43:51,060 --> 01:43:55,860
strong female protagonist struck a chord with me and I can't wait to see lightning do her

2138
01:43:55,860 --> 01:43:56,860
thing.

2139
01:43:56,860 --> 01:43:57,860
No one talks like that.

2140
01:43:57,860 --> 01:44:01,260
In anticipation of the much awaited launch of Final Fantasy 13 and on behalf of Square

2141
01:44:01,260 --> 01:44:07,740
Enix, please join us in celebration of the launch of Final Fantasy 13 on March 9th.

2142
01:44:07,740 --> 01:44:11,780
It's like I can see her eyes reading off the cue card as she's saying.

2143
01:44:11,780 --> 01:44:14,500
No one says protagonist.

2144
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:16,900
Well unless you're a literary nerd.

2145
01:44:16,900 --> 01:44:17,900
And she's not.

2146
01:44:17,900 --> 01:44:19,940
I could run around the land all day.

2147
01:44:19,940 --> 01:44:20,940
This game is awesome.

2148
01:44:20,940 --> 01:44:21,940
It has a wonderful story.

2149
01:44:21,940 --> 01:44:24,020
I want to run around the field.

2150
01:44:24,020 --> 01:44:26,460
It's like, come on, what is wrong with me?

2151
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:29,700
I see something sparkly.

2152
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:35,780
In defense of that, in defense of the running around all day thing, I have been doing a

2153
01:44:35,780 --> 01:44:39,260
lot of that in Star Trek Online just to see, oh I wonder if this planet's here, oh I wonder

2154
01:44:39,260 --> 01:44:40,260
if this planet's here.

2155
01:44:40,260 --> 01:44:41,260
But that's an MMO.

2156
01:44:41,260 --> 01:44:46,140
And the funny thing is, Final Fantasy 13's kind of been getting a little slack for how

2157
01:44:46,140 --> 01:44:47,780
linear it is.

2158
01:44:47,780 --> 01:44:52,320
Like I've heard it's kind of like, you don't have towns and the dungeons are not, you know,

2159
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:53,500
it's a little more linear.

2160
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:54,940
Although I've heard good things about the game.

2161
01:44:54,940 --> 01:44:55,940
It's just a little different.

2162
01:44:55,940 --> 01:44:58,860
So it's just funny to hear her say, I could just, I could just run around all day.

2163
01:44:58,860 --> 01:45:00,260
I could just do that.

2164
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:02,660
I could just run around all day because that's all I know how to do.

2165
01:45:02,660 --> 01:45:08,180
I could run around all day long and annoy the fuck out of my significant other who's

2166
01:45:08,180 --> 01:45:11,140
watching me play this game and go, what the fuck are you doing woman?

2167
01:45:11,140 --> 01:45:14,300
Did you want to say something Alan?

2168
01:45:14,300 --> 01:45:18,820
I was going to say it's the only way really one of her singles is going to sell two million

2169
01:45:18,820 --> 01:45:19,820
copies here.

2170
01:45:19,820 --> 01:45:22,020
Is that she attaches it to that video game.

2171
01:45:22,020 --> 01:45:24,820
Well no because then all the, all the stuck up people are going to be like, oh well the

2172
01:45:24,820 --> 01:45:28,620
Japanese version's better because you know, everything.

2173
01:45:28,620 --> 01:45:34,060
You know who actually had, I think to this date had the best final fantasy song ever.

2174
01:45:34,060 --> 01:45:35,740
And that's Angela Aki.

2175
01:45:35,740 --> 01:45:42,520
I'm sorry that hers was, was such a crap game, but kiss me goodbye was a great song and it

2176
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:43,520
launched her career.

2177
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:45,420
Was it, was that was nine, right?

2178
01:45:45,420 --> 01:45:46,420
Yes.

2179
01:45:46,420 --> 01:45:48,060
But I don't, I don't think nine was a crap game.

2180
01:45:48,060 --> 01:45:49,060
It was one of the better places.

2181
01:45:49,060 --> 01:45:51,580
It was better than eight.

2182
01:45:51,580 --> 01:45:56,400
The thing about nine is it just kind of like, if I remember right, you know, this is many

2183
01:45:56,400 --> 01:46:00,780
years ago, but if I remember right, nine just kind of showed up like just out of nowhere,

2184
01:46:00,780 --> 01:46:02,300
like, Hey, Final Fantasy nine's out.

2185
01:46:02,300 --> 01:46:03,300
Like, Oh wow.

2186
01:46:03,300 --> 01:46:05,280
And then it was like, Hey, fanservice fanservice.

2187
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:07,340
And then Hey, the PS2 is out now.

2188
01:46:07,340 --> 01:46:10,020
Like it was kind of the same thing that Final Fantasy happened with Final Fantasy 12.

2189
01:46:10,020 --> 01:46:12,380
But it was like, Hey, here's Final Fantasy 12 finally.

2190
01:46:12,380 --> 01:46:14,780
Oh, but the Xbox 360 and PS3 are out now.

2191
01:46:14,780 --> 01:46:15,780
Darn.

2192
01:46:15,780 --> 01:46:21,400
Well, I meant, and I'm not saying it was a bad game, I'm not saying crap game was more

2193
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:23,460
like I lost interest in it.

2194
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:29,800
Like I got to the, I got on the airship and I was done, you know, when you first escape,

2195
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:35,360
but it had the best song, uh, SSJ 100 Matt in our chat room saying, looking at the video,

2196
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:37,260
she is using the player one controller.

2197
01:46:37,260 --> 01:46:38,260
Yeah.

2198
01:46:38,260 --> 01:46:41,020
But see, if they're smart, if they're really smart, they have another system that it's

2199
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:47,980
sync to, and then they have the other controller sync to the other one they thought I had an

2200
01:46:47,980 --> 01:46:50,380
idiot could play a Final Fantasy game.

2201
01:46:50,380 --> 01:46:54,280
And after all, she did say that she liked running around the field.

2202
01:46:54,280 --> 01:46:57,640
So maybe they just put her down and maybe that was, she was just running around the

2203
01:46:57,640 --> 01:46:58,640
field.

2204
01:46:58,640 --> 01:46:59,640
Okay.

2205
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:00,640
Look, I like Leona Lewis.

2206
01:47:00,640 --> 01:47:01,640
She's precious.

2207
01:47:01,640 --> 01:47:02,640
She can.

2208
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:05,520
Why are we picking on Leona Lewis?

2209
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:06,520
She's defenseless.

2210
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:08,560
She's like, it's like, it's like, we're kicking Bambi.

2211
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:10,240
Like making fun of Leona Lewis.

2212
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:11,240
We're not making fun of Leona Lewis.

2213
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:13,020
We're making fun of the song.

2214
01:47:13,020 --> 01:47:14,020
She did an avatar.

2215
01:47:14,020 --> 01:47:16,020
How forced that video was.

2216
01:47:16,020 --> 01:47:18,400
I don't mind the Final Fantasy 13 song.

2217
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:22,880
Like I think it, I don't, I think the trailer is kind of weird with all the stuff blowing

2218
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:31,820
up and it's like, you know, like explosions and motorcycles, you know, it's like, it doesn't

2219
01:47:31,820 --> 01:47:32,820
really fit.

2220
01:47:32,820 --> 01:47:40,200
I can put that song then as my battle music in Final Fantasy 14.

2221
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:48,000
When you're attacking a level 75 bunny, crushing your neck,

2222
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:53,320
Yipping your head off.

2223
01:47:53,320 --> 01:47:55,000
I don't like doing falsetto on the show.

2224
01:47:55,000 --> 01:48:01,680
Hey, let's talk about iTunes and iPhone because of course the iPhone, whether a Loki likes

2225
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:04,280
it or not, is another gaming platform.

2226
01:48:04,280 --> 01:48:08,280
And apparently, um, but nevermind.

2227
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:09,280
Okay.

2228
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:14,280
Apparently there's this game out on the iPhone that folks are getting a little crazy about

2229
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:18,040
and it's a wobble eye boobs.

2230
01:48:18,040 --> 01:48:26,200
This program got, use your imagination folks, $30,000 is how much this game made last year,

2231
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:32,040
but it was now being removed because you know, people were complaining about the sexual content.

2232
01:48:32,040 --> 01:48:36,940
Apparently some of the rules that were given as to what is not supposed to be in your app,

2233
01:48:36,940 --> 01:48:44,160
no images of women in bikinis, no images of men in bikinis, no skin, uh, no silhouette

2234
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:49,600
that indicate that wobble can be used for wobbling boobs, no sexual connotations or

2235
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:55,440
innuendo, boobs, babes, booty sex, nothing that can be sexually arousing and no apps

2236
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:58,960
will be approved that in any way imply sexual content.

2237
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:04,200
By the way, the guy asked us since no skin is a cited as a reason this app was pulled.

2238
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:11,500
He asked if a burka was okay, but the Apple guy apparently got angry at that.

2239
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:12,500
I don't know.

2240
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:15,040
Do you think, uh, Apple has a right to be removing these ads?

2241
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:16,040
It's gone.

2242
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:17,040
Huh?

2243
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:18,040
It's gone.

2244
01:49:18,040 --> 01:49:19,040
Oh yeah, it's gone.

2245
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:20,040
Do you think Apple has a right to be taking this stuff down?

2246
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:21,040
Or is it free speech?

2247
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:24,160
I think they have a right, but I think at the same time they should offer this kind

2248
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:25,160
of content.

2249
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:28,280
I mean, just maybe locked somehow.

2250
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:30,680
You can download a song called boobs.

2251
01:49:30,680 --> 01:49:34,720
And aren't there, aren't there apps about like farting and peeing and pooping and all

2252
01:49:34,720 --> 01:49:35,720
this stuff?

2253
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:36,720
That's not nudity.

2254
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:39,000
I'm sure there's apps about blowing people up.

2255
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,000
It's not nudity.

2256
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:44,080
It's not going to go in your pants pooping does involve nudity at some point this way.

2257
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:45,080
Okay.

2258
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:51,400
You can rip people's eyes out, but God damn it, if a boob shakes, it's over for you.

2259
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:53,720
That's kind of messed up.

2260
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:55,020
Should be equal across the board.

2261
01:49:55,020 --> 01:49:57,360
If you're going to have violent video games, which I don't know.

2262
01:49:57,360 --> 01:49:58,360
I don't know.

2263
01:49:58,360 --> 01:50:01,920
Apple's rules of violence, but you're going to have like, you know, the pooping calculator.

2264
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:06,620
I think it's my next bowel movement should be mandatory mandatory for companies that

2265
01:50:06,620 --> 01:50:12,240
put out violent games, that there's equally as much sexual games out there.

2266
01:50:12,240 --> 01:50:16,900
So for example, you know, in a game like God of war that has lots of bloody violence, there

2267
01:50:16,900 --> 01:50:21,560
should be like just some really erotic game that they put out with no violence in it.

2268
01:50:21,560 --> 01:50:22,560
It's only fair.

2269
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:26,480
Just make it prove that you're 18 in order to download the content.

2270
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:27,480
Doesn't it kind of already do that?

2271
01:50:27,480 --> 01:50:31,340
Like I seem to remember like downloading some content and it'll say, this is a just might

2272
01:50:31,340 --> 01:50:32,340
be objectionable.

2273
01:50:32,340 --> 01:50:36,620
I think the keyboard cat app that I have, which will play keyboard cap at the cat at

2274
01:50:36,620 --> 01:50:37,620
the touch of a button.

2275
01:50:37,620 --> 01:50:38,620
It's amazing.

2276
01:50:38,620 --> 01:50:43,120
Uh, actually says this might contain mature content and are you have to be 17 or older

2277
01:50:43,120 --> 01:50:44,120
to continue.

2278
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:46,000
It's keyboard cat.

2279
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:52,000
I know, but I think that cats playing keyboard is offensive.

2280
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,400
It's cruelty to keyboards.

2281
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:55,400
What about dogs playing keyboards?

2282
01:50:55,400 --> 01:50:57,440
I don't give a shit.

2283
01:50:57,440 --> 01:50:58,440
Just curious.

2284
01:50:58,440 --> 01:50:59,440
You should play the bassoon.

2285
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:00,440
I don't know.

2286
01:51:00,440 --> 01:51:01,440
What?

2287
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:02,840
I think I said the bassoon for some reason.

2288
01:51:02,840 --> 01:51:03,840
I don't know.

2289
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:04,840
What?

2290
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:05,840
Where did the bassoon come from?

2291
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:07,560
I think, oh, I mentioned the bassoon quartet earlier.

2292
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:08,560
You're in a bassoon mood.

2293
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:09,560
I see.

2294
01:51:09,560 --> 01:51:10,560
I see.

2295
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:12,280
Rolf, the dog played keyboard before anyone.

2296
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:17,880
So sorry, freaking keyboard cat app.

2297
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:18,880
Now I have to download it.

2298
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:19,880
I always got to bring it back to Muppets.

2299
01:51:19,880 --> 01:51:26,040
I mean, Rolf, the dog is used before keyboard cat.

2300
01:51:26,040 --> 01:51:28,040
Can I do a story?

2301
01:51:28,040 --> 01:51:29,040
Yes.

2302
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:33,640
Speaking of iPhone and violence, yeah, Street Fighter IV is going to be coming on iPhone,

2303
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:35,640
and I'm like, why?

2304
01:51:35,640 --> 01:51:36,640
Really?

2305
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:37,640
Why?

2306
01:51:37,640 --> 01:51:42,200
So far, all we see is Ken and Ryu, nothing really in action.

2307
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:45,200
They look kind of dinky and tiny.

2308
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:55,400
I wasn't aware that the iPhone had a big 3D processor in it or anything, so whatever.

2309
01:51:55,400 --> 01:52:01,400
But in happier news for those of us who will play Super Street Fighter IV, we get some

2310
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:02,640
Street Fighter III characters.

2311
01:52:02,640 --> 01:52:11,800
We get Ibuki, we get Makoto, and we get Dudley, as we mentioned, Rumor of the Week before.

2312
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:13,680
So that's pretty cool.

2313
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:16,320
And there's also this kickbox.

2314
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:21,200
I was looking at the Japanese, I'm sure you saw what my wallpaper was of Sakura, but it

2315
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:24,360
was a Super Street Fighter IV website.

2316
01:52:24,360 --> 01:52:32,960
There's also this Korean Taekwondo fighter who's just vicious.

2317
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:33,960
Absolutely vicious.

2318
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:37,120
They show this character beating up Sagat, and they never show anyone beating up Sagat,

2319
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:40,240
so pretty crazy.

2320
01:52:40,240 --> 01:52:42,640
I didn't play a lot of Street Fighter III, admittedly.

2321
01:52:42,640 --> 01:52:45,920
Are these good characters to be bringing over, or is this kind of like, they could have picked

2322
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:46,920
better ones?

2323
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:48,720
Ibuki was my staple for Street Fighter III.

2324
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:49,720
Same.

2325
01:52:49,720 --> 01:52:50,720
Yeah.

2326
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:51,720
She's fast.

2327
01:52:51,720 --> 01:52:54,720
The only one who I actually would have really liked to see was Elena.

2328
01:52:54,720 --> 01:52:56,200
I think Elena was the one I used.

2329
01:52:56,200 --> 01:52:58,520
She's the one that kind of did like Capoeira type moves, right?

2330
01:52:58,520 --> 01:52:59,520
Yeah.

2331
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:00,520
I used her when I played.

2332
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:01,520
She was all leg.

2333
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:02,520
Ah, very cool.

2334
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:06,240
Kind of like Eddie in Tekken 4, right, or 3, 4, 1 of the 2?

2335
01:53:06,240 --> 01:53:07,240
3.

2336
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:09,520
Because after that they got Christie.

2337
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:11,440
So Street Fighter IV on the iPhone, huh?

2338
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:14,080
They're talking about porting it to the PSP also.

2339
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:16,080
It's going to be interesting.

2340
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:17,080
You know what I-

2341
01:53:17,080 --> 01:53:19,080
I can see the PSP better than I can see the-

2342
01:53:19,080 --> 01:53:20,640
It makes more sense because it has buttons.

2343
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:27,760
The screen capture, well the screen capture, this image that they had of it was like the

2344
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:32,040
joystick and everything was on the screen.

2345
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:35,520
So like, are you going to actually be able to see what you're doing?

2346
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:37,100
No.

2347
01:53:37,100 --> 01:53:38,280
It's a bad idea.

2348
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:40,560
They're going to make money off of it, it's a bad idea.

2349
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:43,600
Well, you know what I think about Street Fighter IV coming to the iPhone?

2350
01:53:43,600 --> 01:53:44,600
Your mom?

2351
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:54,920
Actually, no, that's the Muppet Babies theme.

2352
01:53:54,920 --> 01:54:01,080
I just had it stuck in my head ever since Alan mentioned Rolfe, so.

2353
01:54:01,080 --> 01:54:03,080
Let's jam to this a little bit.

2354
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:10,600
Because it's going to be better than Street Fighter IV on the iPhone, let's face it.

2355
01:54:10,600 --> 01:54:20,240
Oh yeah, no, I don't care about Street Fighter IV on the iPhone, it's going to control like

2356
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:24,000
shit until the Apple releases an actual joystick for the iPhone.

2357
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:25,160
Who cares?

2358
01:54:25,160 --> 01:54:27,800
But I would download a Muppet Babies app, I would.

2359
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:30,880
Well maybe you might be more interested in Fable III.

2360
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:34,680
Fable III, they're talking a little bit about the co-op in the game.

2361
01:54:34,680 --> 01:54:39,860
And it sounds to me, even though they're claiming it's all new and stuff, it sounds just like

2362
01:54:39,860 --> 01:54:45,940
Fable II if you ask me, but according to an interview with Peter Molyneux during the Four

2363
01:54:45,940 --> 01:54:52,680
Guys 1UP podcast, they talked about the co-op system.

2364
01:54:52,680 --> 01:55:00,440
Basically if you go into someone else's game, you'll take your player, your player's dog,

2365
01:55:00,440 --> 01:55:06,640
the weapons that you've crafted as well, all the unique stuff that you've made will be

2366
01:55:06,640 --> 01:55:07,640
in the game.

2367
01:55:07,640 --> 01:55:11,520
So if you don't want to be tied into the person's camera, you could go off and do your own thing.

2368
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:16,840
But of course, just like the second game, you want to be careful of who you invite in

2369
01:55:16,840 --> 01:55:19,760
your game because someone may come and rape all your women.

2370
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:20,760
Just like, you know.

2371
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:22,680
I hate it when that happens.

2372
01:55:22,680 --> 01:55:23,680
Yes, exactly.

2373
01:55:23,680 --> 01:55:29,360
Or it hits on the shopkeeper and they stop working.

2374
01:55:29,360 --> 01:55:32,520
I hate it when I leave my house and I come back and all the women got raped while I was

2375
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:33,520
gone.

2376
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:35,720
It's just, what a downer to your day.

2377
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:36,720
Yes.

2378
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:41,800
So, does Shermie like my jacket?

2379
01:55:41,800 --> 01:55:49,040
I think Shermie is confused at all the feet blocking access to her bed.

2380
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:50,040
Shermie ran away.

2381
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:51,040
Shermie's like, fuck this.

2382
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:52,040
No, she didn't run.

2383
01:55:52,040 --> 01:55:53,040
She waddled.

2384
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:54,040
I won't go get pie.

2385
01:55:54,040 --> 01:55:57,800
She waddled with her little shaking belly.

2386
01:55:57,800 --> 01:56:05,160
So just looking at this, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say Fable 2 and Fable 3,

2387
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:08,000
probably not that much different from each other.

2388
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,000
What a shock.

2389
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:16,440
Despite all this hype, you know, much like the hype from Fable 1 to Fable 2, don't be

2390
01:56:16,440 --> 01:56:18,000
surprised if they're very similar.

2391
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:21,840
Well, if I get to bring all this stuff into the game, can I bring Shermie into my game?

2392
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:22,840
That's what I want to do.

2393
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:24,880
What would she do?

2394
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:25,880
Poop?

2395
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:27,080
Not be able to run and catch up.

2396
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:31,560
No, she'd find a towel that was laying around in your game and piss on it, which is what

2397
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:34,120
she's been doing lately.

2398
01:56:34,120 --> 01:56:36,080
Fuck you to my cat.

2399
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:37,920
We're not at that segment yet.

2400
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:41,400
Anyhow, we'll get there, though.

2401
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:42,400
We'll be there in a minute.

2402
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:47,820
But first, I want to mention this story about a Darksiders demo that's coming to Xbox Live

2403
01:56:47,820 --> 01:56:50,040
and PlayStation Network on February 25th.

2404
01:56:50,040 --> 01:56:51,780
Apparently, it's a pretty extensive demo.

2405
01:56:51,780 --> 01:56:56,460
They're saying, THQ and Vigil Games, they're saying this demo is going to be 90 minutes

2406
01:56:56,460 --> 01:57:02,120
to complete for the average player, which means I'll be able to beat it in 30.

2407
01:57:02,120 --> 01:57:03,120
No, 120.

2408
01:57:03,120 --> 01:57:05,200
Yeah, 90 minutes for the average player.

2409
01:57:05,200 --> 01:57:09,920
Apparently, it's the entire first dungeon of the game and two bosses from the game.

2410
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:15,920
So that's coming out on February 25th for the game Darksiders.

2411
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:20,480
I guess they just wanted to see, wanted to really give you a whole in-depth look at the

2412
01:57:20,480 --> 01:57:21,480
game.

2413
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:22,840
It seems like, why not?

2414
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:27,840
You know, if a game is going to take 50 hours to complete, what's with giving away an hour

2415
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:28,840
and a half for free?

2416
01:57:28,840 --> 01:57:32,840
They could have given away an hour and a half demo for Oblivion and people would just come

2417
01:57:32,840 --> 01:57:33,840
to you.

2418
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:34,840
I mean, there's games.

2419
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:35,840
Get people hooked.

2420
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:38,640
Games like Saints Row where, you know, they had a half an hour demo, I played that demo

2421
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:39,640
like 80 times.

2422
01:57:39,640 --> 01:57:40,640
It was awesome.

2423
01:57:40,640 --> 01:57:41,640
Yeah.

2424
01:57:41,640 --> 01:57:42,640
Get people hooked.

2425
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:43,640
And then there you go.

2426
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:44,640
Kill time until the game came out.

2427
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:45,640
All right.

2428
01:57:45,640 --> 01:57:48,540
Uh, we're going to get into the mailbag section of our show.

2429
01:57:48,540 --> 01:57:52,880
Every time you guys send us emails at mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, we take a moment

2430
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:57,920
during the show to rip open the mailbag and pick a few of our favorite emails to read.

2431
01:57:57,920 --> 01:58:02,080
Dark Soccer is going to dive into the mailbag at mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and read

2432
01:58:02,080 --> 01:58:03,560
some emails right now.

2433
01:58:03,560 --> 01:58:05,480
Hi guys, it's Sam S again.

2434
01:58:05,480 --> 01:58:09,200
I just wanted to say sorry about criticizing your haste when it comes to the feed.

2435
01:58:09,200 --> 01:58:13,400
The article about PopCap dumbass struck as potentially mind blowing.

2436
01:58:13,400 --> 01:58:15,800
I think I'm on the same rage level as Loki on this one.

2437
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:16,800
The guy is a dumbass.

2438
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:21,560
There is no reason PopCap reps need to say anything about the general gaming populace.

2439
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:24,360
They have no fucking clue what the average gamer wants.

2440
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:29,040
This guy needs to shut his mouth and also the iPad is a disgrace and I wish it would

2441
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:31,200
be the downfall of Apple Go Microsoft.

2442
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:33,640
Um, whatever.

2443
01:58:33,640 --> 01:58:36,080
Now this is- Can I respond to that real quick?

2444
01:58:36,080 --> 01:58:40,920
Like dude, you're welcome to your opinion and all that fun stuff, but like, okay, even

2445
01:58:40,920 --> 01:58:48,480
if the iPad fails, Apple still has ginormous business as a phone company.

2446
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:50,080
I know that's not what they started as.

2447
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:54,360
They started with those little green monitors that were in all of our grade school classrooms,

2448
01:58:54,360 --> 01:58:58,400
but they're a huge phone company now and yet computers and all that stuff too, but like

2449
01:58:58,400 --> 01:59:03,040
the phone thing is huge- The Mac is still the standard of the graphic

2450
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:04,040
design industry.

2451
01:59:04,040 --> 01:59:08,640
But yeah, I do remember Loki going off on that one show that was kind of funny and yeah,

2452
01:59:08,640 --> 01:59:09,640
he had a point.

2453
01:59:09,640 --> 01:59:12,280
I'll, I'll, I'll meet you halfway there.

2454
01:59:12,280 --> 01:59:14,880
Now for the long ass email of the night.

2455
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:15,880
Yay!

2456
01:59:15,880 --> 01:59:16,880
Hi, O.L.R.

2457
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:21,660
I'm not sure how much help this email will be, but I was listening to your last two podcasts

2458
01:59:21,660 --> 01:59:26,160
and wanted to know what it would take to get the video game development companies to be

2459
01:59:26,160 --> 01:59:27,160
unionized.

2460
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:30,640
I'm definitely no expert, but I work for a local in Chicago.

2461
01:59:30,640 --> 01:59:34,440
Although I have no say in the local's decisions or anything, I've been with them for a while

2462
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:36,200
now and I've seen how things are done.

2463
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:38,600
I also work closely with one of the largest unions in the US.

2464
01:59:38,600 --> 01:59:42,760
I'm not an employee, but I visit them every day and I see some of the big wigs on a daily

2465
01:59:42,760 --> 01:59:43,760
basis.

2466
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:47,120
I'm no expert, but some of what they do has rubbed off on me.

2467
01:59:47,120 --> 01:59:50,320
At first I thought it involved simple factors like the size of a company or what percentage

2468
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:52,520
of said company wants to be unionized.

2469
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:58,000
I talked to some of the folks at work and they summarized what they said.

2470
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:02,320
Those employees that want to organize need to sit down with the organizer and well, get

2471
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:03,320
organized.

2472
02:00:03,320 --> 02:00:09,440
AFSCME, AFL-CIO, and SCIU are one of the biggest unions, SCIU dealing with USA, Canada, and

2473
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:10,680
Puerto Rico.

2474
02:00:10,680 --> 02:00:14,000
One of the ladies at work said that the video game industry would probably fall under the

2475
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:18,440
entertainment category, which should mean that all of the unions, the AFL-CIO is the

2476
02:00:18,440 --> 02:00:19,440
one to contact.

2477
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:22,680
What they need to do is contact their closest AFL-CIO branch.

2478
02:00:22,680 --> 02:00:27,180
It all depends, although, because I don't know which video game company you had in mind.

2479
02:00:27,180 --> 02:00:30,600
If you were thinking EA, where a friend of mine works, they would need to contact the

2480
02:00:30,600 --> 02:00:32,280
Sacramento office or maybe San Francisco.

2481
02:00:32,280 --> 02:00:33,280
I honestly can't remember.

2482
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:35,520
I didn't take notes and there's a link.

2483
02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:42,520
It's actually aflcio.org slash join a union slash how slash how to dot CFM.

2484
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:46,880
Now you can end my email here, but I'd like to voice my opinion on this.

2485
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:50,320
Protecting video game workers is probably supported by most gamers who feel they should

2486
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:53,320
have fair work hours, pay, and everything else.

2487
02:00:53,320 --> 02:00:59,560
However, say there's a strike at Square Enix and it prevented the release of the newest

2488
02:00:59,560 --> 02:01:02,900
Final Fantasy game or strike at Capcom that's keeping the newest crossover fighting game

2489
02:01:02,900 --> 02:01:04,240
from coming out.

2490
02:01:04,240 --> 02:01:06,840
Will gamers still support the striking workers?

2491
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:08,760
Who will gamers choose the product to the workers?

2492
02:01:08,760 --> 02:01:12,600
I honestly don't know what I'd want more to be honest.

2493
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:16,000
Remember the writer strike that prevented new episodes of TV shows from premiering?

2494
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:19,920
Were you reading for the writers or were you craving more episodes of lost or ugly Betty?

2495
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:20,920
Oh wow.

2496
02:01:20,920 --> 02:01:22,120
My, my insertment.

2497
02:01:22,120 --> 02:01:24,240
I didn't care.

2498
02:01:24,240 --> 02:01:25,600
I don't, I don't really watch.

2499
02:01:25,600 --> 02:01:29,200
I know you don't watch a lot of TV, but look from the standpoint of somebody who was like,

2500
02:01:29,200 --> 02:01:32,320
I think the writer's strike kind of ruined heroes that show.

2501
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:36,420
Well, the second season was already kind of poopy, but like, I don't know, like the writer's

2502
02:01:36,420 --> 02:01:39,560
strike really damned some shows that were on a roll.

2503
02:01:39,560 --> 02:01:42,720
I see, I see the point the email was trying to make.

2504
02:01:42,720 --> 02:01:45,880
It's a, it's a, it's a great point and one I didn't, one I didn't consider last

2505
02:01:45,880 --> 02:01:46,880
week.

2506
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:48,320
That's why I'm glad we got emails on it.

2507
02:01:48,320 --> 02:01:51,840
But if companies also want to keep their product going, they need to have a quality work environment

2508
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:53,760
for the people that are working for them.

2509
02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:58,480
You have to respect the worker, but to continue, I remember in high school after I graduated,

2510
02:01:58,480 --> 02:02:02,400
the teachers were striking for whatever reason, maybe pay, and they kept school from starting

2511
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:05,720
on time, which meant the end of the school year was that much later.

2512
02:02:05,720 --> 02:02:09,400
The students were not happy and wanting, and one of the striking to end, not for the teacher

2513
02:02:09,400 --> 02:02:11,200
sake, but for their early release.

2514
02:02:11,200 --> 02:02:16,000
Who knows, I probably didn't want to be on the teacher side because teachers aren't

2515
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,360
usually students' best friend, who knows.

2516
02:02:18,360 --> 02:02:21,480
So yeah, I wouldn't know, um, know what I'd go for.

2517
02:02:21,480 --> 02:02:25,960
If you support the workers, then be really sure you still support them, even at the cost

2518
02:02:25,960 --> 02:02:28,600
of the release date of a game you're really looking forward to.

2519
02:02:28,600 --> 02:02:31,920
Stan, Rob, it was nice to meet, it was nice meeting you when you came to ASIN.

2520
02:02:31,920 --> 02:02:32,920
I know I was kind of boring.

2521
02:02:32,920 --> 02:02:33,920
Oh, okay, okay.

2522
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:34,920
I know who this is.

2523
02:02:34,920 --> 02:02:39,240
Well, that was a great email and, and, and brought up some points and, um, I don't,

2524
02:02:39,240 --> 02:02:43,480
I don't know if you told me you worked for a union, but that's really neat that, um,

2525
02:02:43,480 --> 02:02:46,280
to kind of see that side of it and kind of brought up some things I didn't think about.

2526
02:02:46,280 --> 02:02:49,020
Like especially, yeah, what would happen if they go on strike?

2527
02:02:49,020 --> 02:02:52,640
You know, we hear all these reports about conditions and again, I want to make this

2528
02:02:52,640 --> 02:02:53,640
clear.

2529
02:02:53,640 --> 02:02:57,480
I wasn't necessarily like supporting saying they should unionize, I was just kind of asking

2530
02:02:57,480 --> 02:03:01,040
the question, what about like, is it a feasible option?

2531
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:02,040
Question mark.

2532
02:03:02,040 --> 02:03:03,040
I don't know.

2533
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:09,160
You know, the only, the only way anything's going to change if, is, is if something is

2534
02:03:09,160 --> 02:03:10,160
done.

2535
02:03:10,160 --> 02:03:14,720
So I was just suggesting maybe union, is that something maybe then it's kind of neat to

2536
02:03:14,720 --> 02:03:18,880
get that email and think about that perspective is that, you know, if, if that were to happen,

2537
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:23,080
uh, strikes would be a very real possibility and people already bitch and complain when

2538
02:03:23,080 --> 02:03:27,440
games are delayed, even if the game is being delayed for quality reasons.

2539
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:28,440
You know?

2540
02:03:28,440 --> 02:03:29,440
Yeah.

2541
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:30,880
A lot of people have been, I think Final Fantasy was a good example.

2542
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:35,240
A lot of people have been given Final Fantasy some smack because 13 has taken forever to

2543
02:03:35,240 --> 02:03:36,240
come out.

2544
02:03:36,240 --> 02:03:39,880
But what if it had been delayed even more because of some type of, of workers strike?

2545
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:41,680
That's a, an interesting point.

2546
02:03:41,680 --> 02:03:42,680
I don't know.

2547
02:03:42,680 --> 02:03:47,120
I would like to think me personally, I'm okay with the game being delayed as long as they're

2548
02:03:47,120 --> 02:03:48,840
going to put out a quality product at the end.

2549
02:03:48,840 --> 02:03:51,320
Like I was really looking forward to blur that was supposed to come out fourth quarter

2550
02:03:51,320 --> 02:03:55,160
last year, but they delayed it to this year because they want to make sure online wasn't

2551
02:03:55,160 --> 02:03:56,160
fucked.

2552
02:03:56,160 --> 02:03:57,160
And I'm okay with that.

2553
02:03:57,160 --> 02:03:58,640
I would rather they fix it than put out a crap game.

2554
02:03:58,640 --> 02:03:59,640
Oh, I agree.

2555
02:03:59,640 --> 02:04:01,640
I agree with that.

2556
02:04:01,640 --> 02:04:06,680
Um, there actually is one more email, um, about, uh, the unions.

2557
02:04:06,680 --> 02:04:12,280
Hey, O-O-L-R. I know we've been on this topic for three weeks now, so I will keep it short.

2558
02:04:12,280 --> 02:04:16,600
The problem with unionizing game developers is that unions cost extra money that game

2559
02:04:16,600 --> 02:04:19,120
publishers are just not going to be willing to pay for.

2560
02:04:19,120 --> 02:04:21,680
They'll just hire non-unionized employees.

2561
02:04:21,680 --> 02:04:25,480
Lord knows that there are enough people desperate to get into the industry by any means possible

2562
02:04:25,480 --> 02:04:29,520
that they will work god awful hours thinking they're the next best game developer since

2563
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:30,520
Miyamoto.

2564
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:34,640
Basically, as long as there are people to take advantage of, this will probably never

2565
02:04:34,640 --> 02:04:35,640
stop.

2566
02:04:35,640 --> 02:04:38,720
Unfortunately, it doesn't leave much room for people with families who don't want to

2567
02:04:38,720 --> 02:04:41,760
or simply can't work 12 hour days, seven days a week.

2568
02:04:41,760 --> 02:04:45,040
These people get suckered in by company lies when they say they're getting hired for the

2569
02:04:45,040 --> 02:04:49,980
job saying that crunch periods will only happen on a necessity basis.

2570
02:04:49,980 --> 02:04:54,540
The crunch period slowly becomes perpetual and if they don't crunch, they get fired.

2571
02:04:54,540 --> 02:04:58,360
The only light at the end of the tunnel I can see is if all the talent gets wise to

2572
02:04:58,360 --> 02:05:01,720
this sort of thing and the bottom is just going to fall out of the industry.

2573
02:05:01,720 --> 02:05:05,760
There are no senior level developers left and all you have is a bunch of hotshots with

2574
02:05:05,760 --> 02:05:09,160
a degree who don't actually know how to get a game out on time.

2575
02:05:09,160 --> 02:05:13,160
The EA's, Rockstar's, Activision's of the world need to realize that their employees

2576
02:05:13,160 --> 02:05:17,000
are really the ones who make the money for them and if they don't treat them well, they

2577
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,040
won't have a leg left to stand on.

2578
02:05:19,040 --> 02:05:20,480
Hopefully I kept that brief enough.

2579
02:05:20,480 --> 02:05:23,980
As a programmer myself, I count my blessings for being employed by a company that lets

2580
02:05:23,980 --> 02:05:29,720
us go home at 7 p.m. though plenty of us stay later willingly and doesn't make us work weekends

2581
02:05:29,720 --> 02:05:33,120
and I think it's outrageous that there are situations like this right in my backyard

2582
02:05:33,120 --> 02:05:35,120
since I work in Silicon Valley.

2583
02:05:35,120 --> 02:05:37,880
Here's truly AZHP.

2584
02:05:37,880 --> 02:05:41,980
Well I wish we could name, I completely understand why you don't want to say who you work for

2585
02:05:41,980 --> 02:05:48,860
on a delicate subject like this so please, but I wish we could recognize whatever company

2586
02:05:48,860 --> 02:05:55,280
that is and go yay and pat them on the back for having kind of a good employee policy

2587
02:05:55,280 --> 02:05:58,060
like that.

2588
02:05:58,060 --> 02:06:02,280
Maybe that's what it's going to take is negative press for these companies like EA and whatever

2589
02:06:02,280 --> 02:06:06,120
else we've heard about with the nightmare hours to curb it.

2590
02:06:06,120 --> 02:06:08,200
Bad press is never really a good thing.

2591
02:06:08,200 --> 02:06:09,200
I don't know.

2592
02:06:09,200 --> 02:06:10,200
It's not an easy issue.

2593
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:15,840
I think this second emailer makes a really good point about the whole people are dying

2594
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:17,320
to get into the video games industry.

2595
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:22,840
I mean most of those tester positions are like temps, they're temp jobs through contracting

2596
02:06:22,840 --> 02:06:26,880
agencies and that's how many people get their foot in the door which is why I think it's

2597
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:31,520
hilarious that they're glamorizing the whole thing on this PlayStation 3 show, the tester

2598
02:06:31,520 --> 02:06:33,460
or whatever it's called that's coming out.

2599
02:06:33,460 --> 02:06:35,760
Now granted I haven't watched it yet.

2600
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:38,280
You get to test Barbie soccer.

2601
02:06:38,280 --> 02:06:42,840
I'll look at it because I like reality TV and I like video games so you would think

2602
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:46,680
I would like some and I like how sparks so you would think I'm all about something like

2603
02:06:46,680 --> 02:06:49,920
the tester but I just I know I'm not gonna like it.

2604
02:06:49,920 --> 02:06:52,840
I just know it.

2605
02:06:52,840 --> 02:06:56,520
But something like that kind of glamorizes what might not actually be that glamorous.

2606
02:06:56,520 --> 02:07:00,240
It's just a little hard watching a show that's basically a commercial shoved down your throat.

2607
02:07:00,240 --> 02:07:01,480
Did you watch it?

2608
02:07:01,480 --> 02:07:04,320
No, but I can guess what it's gonna be.

2609
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:06,160
A giant commercial shoved down my throat.

2610
02:07:06,160 --> 02:07:07,160
Oh look it!

2611
02:07:07,160 --> 02:07:09,000
Let's test God of War 3!

2612
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:13,920
Oh my goodness it's so epic and wonderful but look at all these bugs!

2613
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:14,920
No it's not gonna be like that.

2614
02:07:14,920 --> 02:07:19,880
All it's gonna be is them stupid challenges that are game related and then they get to

2615
02:07:19,880 --> 02:07:24,460
talk about how awesome it was to get to play God of War 3 for anybody else.

2616
02:07:24,460 --> 02:07:29,640
You know what would make me watch the tester is if RuPaul was the judge.

2617
02:07:29,640 --> 02:07:35,480
You know and that at the end of every episode remember don't fuck it up.

2618
02:07:35,480 --> 02:07:40,560
It's time for you to lip sync for your life.

2619
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:44,160
Seriously if you've never watched Drag Race it's like the best reality show on right now.

2620
02:07:44,160 --> 02:07:45,640
Well can I read the last email?

2621
02:07:45,640 --> 02:07:46,640
Of course.

2622
02:07:46,640 --> 02:07:49,520
Dear OLR, I have a pair of questions for Loki.

2623
02:07:49,520 --> 02:07:55,640
If I buy a banned modded 360 console and play a game with a patch, can I download the patch

2624
02:07:55,640 --> 02:07:58,840
and will the patch prevent me from playing a burned game?

2625
02:07:58,840 --> 02:08:01,360
I wholly understand if you refuse to answer this question.

2626
02:08:01,360 --> 02:08:03,760
Stay care entertainment.

2627
02:08:03,760 --> 02:08:06,400
Repeat that.

2628
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:08,560
A banned modded 360.

2629
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:10,560
Okay.

2630
02:08:10,560 --> 02:08:13,060
And has a game that patches released for it.

2631
02:08:13,060 --> 02:08:18,400
Can you download the patch and will the patch prevent you from playing the burned game?

2632
02:08:18,400 --> 02:08:20,840
No the patch will not prevent you from playing the burned game but you're not going to be

2633
02:08:20,840 --> 02:08:23,360
able to connect to live to download the patch.

2634
02:08:23,360 --> 02:08:28,080
So you would have to download the patch by some other means and then transfer it to your

2635
02:08:28,080 --> 02:08:33,840
hard drive and then yes you would be able to do that.

2636
02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:35,960
It's over!

2637
02:08:35,960 --> 02:08:39,640
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us emails.

2638
02:08:39,640 --> 02:08:42,040
I think that's the way Dark Soccer should end the mailbag every week.

2639
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:43,040
It's over!

2640
02:08:43,040 --> 02:08:47,360
There is actually a website though that does carry all of the game patches that are out

2641
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:52,200
there for Xbox 360 and you can download them all individually and search by title.

2642
02:08:52,200 --> 02:08:56,200
Unfortunately I do not remember what that website is but I know that if you do a search

2643
02:08:56,200 --> 02:09:00,120
on Google you'll probably be able to find it because I've seen it a few times.

2644
02:09:00,120 --> 02:09:05,600
But that would be the way to do it if you're going to bother patching a game.

2645
02:09:05,600 --> 02:09:09,920
Alright well now that the email segment is done it's time for us to get to the angst

2646
02:09:09,920 --> 02:09:14,640
but Dark Soccer ran out real quick so I guess let's just cover some gaming news.

2647
02:09:14,640 --> 02:09:17,000
We'll do the angst before Skypline tonight.

2648
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,560
Okie dokie.

2649
02:09:19,560 --> 02:09:23,360
So let's see let's talk about a few naughty games.

2650
02:09:23,360 --> 02:09:25,180
Yay!

2651
02:09:25,180 --> 02:09:26,180
Naughty games!

2652
02:09:26,180 --> 02:09:27,400
Bubble Bath Babes 2?

2653
02:09:27,400 --> 02:09:28,400
Not quite.

2654
02:09:28,400 --> 02:09:30,280
This is actually Miss World Nude 2010.

2655
02:09:30,280 --> 02:09:32,960
This doesn't even really have a game involved with it.

2656
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:37,560
I mean they're just, it's basically if Ubisoft were to release this today it would be probably

2657
02:09:37,560 --> 02:09:40,440
called My Masturbation Coach.

2658
02:09:40,440 --> 02:09:42,140
Press A C Tits?

2659
02:09:42,140 --> 02:09:43,640
Is that the name of the game?

2660
02:09:43,640 --> 02:09:51,000
No it's basically a game that tracks your masturbation and what not.

2661
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:55,600
Wait is this like, instead of like My Fitness Coach or Wii Fit?

2662
02:09:55,600 --> 02:09:56,600
Exactly.

2663
02:09:56,600 --> 02:09:58,440
It tracks your...

2664
02:09:58,440 --> 02:09:59,440
Masturbation.

2665
02:09:59,440 --> 02:10:00,440
Ok.

2666
02:10:00,440 --> 02:10:01,440
Alright.

2667
02:10:01,440 --> 02:10:09,080
Do you have to enter it in manually?

2668
02:10:09,080 --> 02:10:10,080
Funny.

2669
02:10:10,080 --> 02:10:15,880
Anyways the game is from the game developer Waffle which they went right there because

2670
02:10:15,880 --> 02:10:17,520
their name is Waffle.

2671
02:10:17,520 --> 02:10:19,280
I can't compete with that.

2672
02:10:19,280 --> 02:10:25,480
The Eero title looks, let me butcher this real quick here.

2673
02:10:25,480 --> 02:10:32,800
Looks like a Migeti Ga Tomarane Boku 2.

2674
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:33,800
I'm not even going to bother.

2675
02:10:33,800 --> 02:10:37,080
Are we talking like a Belgian Waffle or like an Eggo?

2676
02:10:37,080 --> 02:10:38,080
It's just Waffle.

2677
02:10:38,080 --> 02:10:40,080
Waffle, Waffle, Waffle.

2678
02:10:40,080 --> 02:10:41,080
Anyways.

2679
02:10:41,080 --> 02:10:46,440
That's going to be in a song someday I know that.

2680
02:10:46,440 --> 02:10:49,040
That's the code name of the game right there.

2681
02:10:49,040 --> 02:10:50,040
Waffle, Waffle.

2682
02:10:50,040 --> 02:10:55,160
Anyways so the game records important events or everyday events.

2683
02:10:55,160 --> 02:10:58,720
For example, today's play style, Socks Masturbation.

2684
02:10:58,720 --> 02:11:05,280
Yes, they give you inspirational methods of masturbation.

2685
02:11:05,280 --> 02:11:11,120
For example, number of times you've wanked today, total number of times wanked so far,

2686
02:11:11,120 --> 02:11:17,480
there is a graphical chart that has it all, time taken for ejaculation and average time

2687
02:11:17,480 --> 02:11:18,480
taken for ejaculation.

2688
02:11:18,480 --> 02:11:21,240
Is it animation with little dead sperm?

2689
02:11:21,240 --> 02:11:23,680
They've got like cute anime girls that are in there.

2690
02:11:23,680 --> 02:11:24,680
But it gets better.

2691
02:11:24,680 --> 02:11:25,680
It gets better.

2692
02:11:25,680 --> 02:11:31,160
And then of course they have a wonderful database where you can organize and track information.

2693
02:11:31,160 --> 02:11:37,040
Total time spent wanking so far, total number of ejaculations so far.

2694
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:41,360
And then of course, oh this is even better.

2695
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:49,600
And then they list innovative methods of masturbation you might have never thought about.

2696
02:11:49,600 --> 02:11:54,640
Including in the diagram here, it looks like that stuff cut out of foam and then someone

2697
02:11:54,640 --> 02:11:57,280
has like foam pieces in the tube.

2698
02:11:57,280 --> 02:11:58,280
I don't know.

2699
02:11:58,280 --> 02:12:04,560
Anyways, but then of course the game is sold with like a pocket pussy as well.

2700
02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:05,560
Oh!

2701
02:12:05,560 --> 02:12:09,400
I thought you just used the Wii Fitness board.

2702
02:12:09,400 --> 02:12:11,720
The Tenga Egg Wavy is what it's called.

2703
02:12:11,720 --> 02:12:15,320
I thought that's what the resistance strap was for.

2704
02:12:15,320 --> 02:12:16,320
Ripped for your pleasure.

2705
02:12:16,320 --> 02:12:24,240
I mean yeah, the cover, I mean it's just topless anime chicks all wet and thriving around.

2706
02:12:24,240 --> 02:12:28,440
There is no way you would not know what this game is about.

2707
02:12:28,440 --> 02:12:32,080
So yes, that is coming from Waffle in Japan.

2708
02:12:32,080 --> 02:12:33,080
Waffle!

2709
02:12:33,080 --> 02:12:34,080
Waffle!

2710
02:12:34,080 --> 02:12:39,240
I'm sorry, but it's just, I don't know if you've ever played my personal walking coach

2711
02:12:39,240 --> 02:12:43,320
on the DS, but you can actually connect to the internet and upload your steps to this

2712
02:12:43,320 --> 02:12:47,920
big online database that shows you how far the world has walked to the moon or the earth.

2713
02:12:47,920 --> 02:12:53,880
So you should be able to do the same thing here and show total lost productivity time.

2714
02:12:53,880 --> 02:13:02,080
I would imagine that the pedometer could probably be used in a slimmer fashion for this device.

2715
02:13:02,080 --> 02:13:06,600
Not gonna see this on DSiWare unfortunately.

2716
02:13:06,600 --> 02:13:08,800
Okay and then the other thing, there's a weird glitch that's actually...

2717
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:10,160
But wait, there's more!

2718
02:13:10,160 --> 02:13:12,520
Yes, there is more.

2719
02:13:12,520 --> 02:13:14,480
No More Heroes 2, Desperate Struggle.

2720
02:13:14,480 --> 02:13:21,780
Of course there's a lot of sexual innuendo in the game, but there is also a save glitch

2721
02:13:21,780 --> 02:13:27,040
apparently that causes one of the female characters to appear completely naked.

2722
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:28,920
I'm watching it.

2723
02:13:28,920 --> 02:13:35,600
And it's funny, it's basically because Travis in the game, the way he saves is by taking

2724
02:13:35,600 --> 02:13:39,960
a dump in like a toilet, and that's the animation that they show.

2725
02:13:39,960 --> 02:13:47,320
Well this chick that's in the game, she's actually taking a shower.

2726
02:13:47,320 --> 02:13:49,840
Well the glitch is that somehow she ends up in the middle of the...

2727
02:13:49,840 --> 02:13:50,840
Ew!

2728
02:13:50,840 --> 02:13:53,760
No, she does not take a dump in the shower.

2729
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:58,360
A Shinobu.

2730
02:13:58,360 --> 02:14:00,160
I'll give you a moment.

2731
02:14:00,160 --> 02:14:01,160
She's not...

2732
02:14:01,160 --> 02:14:02,160
Well she's fake naked.

2733
02:14:02,160 --> 02:14:06,600
Yeah, it's Sims naked type of stuff.

2734
02:14:06,600 --> 02:14:10,680
But still, the thing is that she does not have clothes on and they cannot patch that

2735
02:14:10,680 --> 02:14:11,680
out.

2736
02:14:11,680 --> 02:14:15,560
Go Nintendo.

2737
02:14:15,560 --> 02:14:19,120
No word on how exactly to recreate the glitch, but it is on YouTube for those who want to

2738
02:14:19,120 --> 02:14:21,280
check it out.

2739
02:14:21,280 --> 02:14:23,600
Rob is having a real life segfault right now.

2740
02:14:23,600 --> 02:14:25,000
It's pretty amazing.

2741
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:32,040
I can't get the image in my head of the game saving her pooping in the shower.

2742
02:14:32,040 --> 02:14:34,800
Like that's nasty.

2743
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:36,480
That doesn't just watch down the drain.

2744
02:14:36,480 --> 02:14:40,680
He even calls it dropping a save.

2745
02:14:40,680 --> 02:14:43,080
I'm gonna go drop a save.

2746
02:14:43,080 --> 02:14:53,720
And SSJ100Matt threw out the requisite tub girl question mark in our chat.

2747
02:14:53,720 --> 02:14:57,520
No, it's not tub girl.

2748
02:14:57,520 --> 02:14:58,520
Meh.

2749
02:14:58,520 --> 02:14:59,520
Alright.

2750
02:14:59,520 --> 02:15:01,520
Ow, my stomach hurts.

2751
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:02,520
Please.

2752
02:15:02,520 --> 02:15:22,320
Yeah, we need to do the FUs of the week now because I hurt from laughing.

2753
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:28,160
FU to a bunch of little tiny minor things adding up to put me in the single worst mood

2754
02:15:28,160 --> 02:15:30,520
I have ever been in in ages.

2755
02:15:30,520 --> 02:15:31,520
Rob, breathe.

2756
02:15:31,520 --> 02:15:32,520
I'm trying.

2757
02:15:32,520 --> 02:15:34,520
I don't know why it's so funny.

2758
02:15:34,520 --> 02:15:35,520
Okay, I'm okay.

2759
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:36,520
I'm okay.

2760
02:15:36,520 --> 02:15:37,520
Carry on.

2761
02:15:37,520 --> 02:15:39,520
You're still speaking like you've been kicked in the nuts.

2762
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:40,520
Carry on.

2763
02:15:40,520 --> 02:15:41,520
We're fine.

2764
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:42,520
Try to do a show.

2765
02:15:42,520 --> 02:15:43,520
Professional radio.

2766
02:15:43,520 --> 02:15:44,520
Uh huh.

2767
02:15:44,520 --> 02:15:45,520
Yeah, right.

2768
02:15:45,520 --> 02:15:46,520
We're professional.

2769
02:15:46,520 --> 02:15:51,800
And a secondary FU to my wrist because I've started crocheting again.

2770
02:15:51,800 --> 02:15:56,560
This problem with my wrist swelling on one of the tendons has actually come back.

2771
02:15:56,560 --> 02:16:00,640
I started using a thumb trackball mouse to get it to go away.

2772
02:16:00,640 --> 02:16:04,360
But no, I discovered that I like crocheting again and so now it's decided to come back

2773
02:16:04,360 --> 02:16:07,120
so I have to stop crocheting as often.

2774
02:16:07,120 --> 02:16:08,120
See?

2775
02:16:08,120 --> 02:16:09,120
Aww.

2776
02:16:09,120 --> 02:16:11,120
Ew, you can kind of see that.

2777
02:16:11,120 --> 02:16:13,960
Yeah, I'm going to take a picture of it and put it up online because I'm that kind of

2778
02:16:13,960 --> 02:16:14,960
exhibitionist.

2779
02:16:14,960 --> 02:16:15,960
Wanna see?

2780
02:16:15,960 --> 02:16:22,600
Who wants to see my big bump?

2781
02:16:22,600 --> 02:16:25,240
Careful waffle entertainment might put that in their next game.

2782
02:16:25,240 --> 02:16:26,240
Loki.

2783
02:16:26,240 --> 02:16:29,600
Uh, empty my cold.

2784
02:16:29,600 --> 02:16:31,400
I hate coughing.

2785
02:16:31,400 --> 02:16:33,240
It's tough.

2786
02:16:33,240 --> 02:16:34,720
Um, I don't know.

2787
02:16:34,720 --> 02:16:35,720
I'm not super angsty.

2788
02:16:35,720 --> 02:16:40,000
FU to that not funny image that made me not stop laughing.

2789
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:47,080
Um, FU to just, um, moves taking me like three weeks to accomplish moving.

2790
02:16:47,080 --> 02:16:50,900
Although everything was really smooth with the big furniture today, I still have so much

2791
02:16:50,900 --> 02:16:51,900
stuff to clean.

2792
02:16:51,900 --> 02:16:52,900
So FU to cleaning.

2793
02:16:52,900 --> 02:16:53,900
Grrr.

2794
02:16:53,900 --> 02:16:54,900
Argh.

2795
02:16:54,900 --> 02:16:58,920
Um, Alan, do you have any FUs of the week you'd like to share with our audience?

2796
02:16:58,920 --> 02:17:06,120
FU to having to, uh, job search or super serious rather than just casually having to find another

2797
02:17:06,120 --> 02:17:07,120
job.

2798
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:10,600
Do you want to try sharing some of your talents in case anyone's looking to hire somebody?

2799
02:17:10,600 --> 02:17:13,640
You can always get a job as a video game tester.

2800
02:17:13,640 --> 02:17:14,640
Oh yeah.

2801
02:17:14,640 --> 02:17:15,640
Yes, he's breathing.

2802
02:17:15,640 --> 02:17:19,640
I think he qualifies.

2803
02:17:19,640 --> 02:17:20,640
So all right.

2804
02:17:20,640 --> 02:17:24,600
Uh, let's go ahead and, uh, let me do another story for you guys here from, uh, one more

2805
02:17:24,600 --> 02:17:28,880
story and then we're going to open up the Skype line at one eight seven seven game O

2806
02:17:28,880 --> 02:17:33,320
L R username on Skype is orange lounge radio, but we do have one more story and it's about

2807
02:17:33,320 --> 02:17:38,640
a new video game movie in the works and that movie missile command.

2808
02:17:38,640 --> 02:17:40,160
Yes, that's right.

2809
02:17:40,160 --> 02:17:43,920
Missile command apparently is being made into a movie at least.

2810
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:44,920
Well, I don't know.

2811
02:17:44,920 --> 02:17:48,160
A lot of things they say are going to get made into a movie, but don't really, but this

2812
02:17:48,160 --> 02:17:49,220
is the latest one.

2813
02:17:49,220 --> 02:17:53,720
It's got more of a plot than monopoly, the movie and clue and all this stuff, right?

2814
02:17:53,720 --> 02:17:54,840
They were talking about previously.

2815
02:17:54,840 --> 02:17:56,160
They should not remake clue.

2816
02:17:56,160 --> 02:17:57,160
Clue was awesome.

2817
02:17:57,160 --> 02:17:58,160
The first time.

2818
02:17:58,160 --> 02:18:01,640
Well, apparently, uh, it's coming from the Los Angeles times that Atari is trying to

2819
02:18:01,640 --> 02:18:06,600
sell a missile command film to do whatever they want to try to make to a movie production

2820
02:18:06,600 --> 02:18:09,320
company, uh, to get the missile command movie made.

2821
02:18:09,320 --> 02:18:11,840
I don't know what it would be about, uh, but whatever.

2822
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:17,960
It's gotta be better than like Armageddon was no word if yards revenge might become

2823
02:18:17,960 --> 02:18:18,960
a movie.

2824
02:18:18,960 --> 02:18:19,960
Who knows?

2825
02:18:19,960 --> 02:18:20,960
I don't know.

2826
02:18:20,960 --> 02:18:21,960
What kind of movie would you make at a missile command?

2827
02:18:21,960 --> 02:18:27,120
I don't know where either if I'm just going to be in the movie or not.

2828
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:28,120
What's that?

2829
02:18:28,120 --> 02:18:29,120
A crappy one.

2830
02:18:29,120 --> 02:18:30,600
I don't know.

2831
02:18:30,600 --> 02:18:31,600
I don't know.

2832
02:18:31,600 --> 02:18:32,600
Whatever.

2833
02:18:32,600 --> 02:18:33,600
Yeah, of course.

2834
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:34,600
It's not showing up.

2835
02:18:34,600 --> 02:18:35,600
That came up in chat.

2836
02:18:35,600 --> 02:18:41,360
Like two people asked is Mr Awesome, the star going back to some, uh, years old topics from

2837
02:18:41,360 --> 02:18:44,280
all games, radio, the network that we are on.

2838
02:18:44,280 --> 02:18:48,000
Let's get to the Skype line and quickly one eight seven seven game O L R. If you'd like

2839
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:51,600
to give us a call right now, Skype line is open for business or you can give us a call

2840
02:18:51,600 --> 02:18:55,240
at username orange lounge radio on Skype.

2841
02:18:55,240 --> 02:18:58,120
We'll get to your calls in just a moment while we wait for those calls to come in cause there's

2842
02:18:58,120 --> 02:18:59,120
always a little bit of a delay.

2843
02:18:59,120 --> 02:19:01,040
We'll get to some last minute stories.

2844
02:19:01,040 --> 02:19:02,040
Loki.

2845
02:19:02,040 --> 02:19:03,040
Yes.

2846
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:06,900
Uh, the new expansion for resident evil five also featured in the gold edition, um, has

2847
02:19:06,900 --> 02:19:11,480
an Easter egg where you can actually unlock the classic camera and you already talked

2848
02:19:11,480 --> 02:19:12,480
about that, didn't you?

2849
02:19:12,480 --> 02:19:15,960
No, that was one of my stories that you put in there.

2850
02:19:15,960 --> 02:19:16,960
Thank you.

2851
02:19:16,960 --> 02:19:17,960
Sorry.

2852
02:19:17,960 --> 02:19:21,640
You won't, you wanted to talk about that, but sorry.

2853
02:19:21,640 --> 02:19:22,640
Well how about something else?

2854
02:19:22,640 --> 02:19:26,440
I've got one on the ESRB site.

2855
02:19:26,440 --> 02:19:28,360
Q's working on a pixel junk racer.

2856
02:19:28,360 --> 02:19:29,360
Second lap.

2857
02:19:29,360 --> 02:19:33,480
There you go.

2858
02:19:33,480 --> 02:19:37,120
It appears that racers is the one that plays like a super sprint or whatever that old ass

2859
02:19:37,120 --> 02:19:38,120
Atari game is.

2860
02:19:38,120 --> 02:19:39,120
Right?

2861
02:19:39,120 --> 02:19:40,120
Yeah.

2862
02:19:40,120 --> 02:19:41,120
Okay.

2863
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:42,120
I remember that one.

2864
02:19:42,120 --> 02:19:43,120
Yes.

2865
02:19:43,120 --> 02:19:44,120
Let's go to the phones.

2866
02:19:44,120 --> 02:19:45,120
We got a call.

2867
02:19:45,120 --> 02:19:46,120
Hi, you're on orange lodge radio.

2868
02:19:46,120 --> 02:19:47,120
Who's this?

2869
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:48,120
This is the legend of Zaku.

2870
02:19:48,120 --> 02:19:49,120
What's on your mind?

2871
02:19:49,120 --> 02:19:50,120
Uh, nothing much.

2872
02:19:50,120 --> 02:19:53,120
Just recovering from another dull and lackluster weekend.

2873
02:19:53,120 --> 02:19:58,120
Um, yeah, I just, I think, I don't know if you've probably heard about this story that

2874
02:19:58,120 --> 02:20:02,640
was like hitting up the rounds on slash side and I think could, could talk to recently

2875
02:20:02,640 --> 02:20:08,100
about a company, but a video game developer who had, who had operations in Australia and

2876
02:20:08,100 --> 02:20:13,600
apparently since, uh, for some reason or another, we're trying to pull out of that country.

2877
02:20:13,600 --> 02:20:19,080
But before they did, they actually snuck into their, you know, to the Australian offices,

2878
02:20:19,080 --> 02:20:24,720
you know, their developers that they had down there, they snuck in and they actually, they

2879
02:20:24,720 --> 02:20:29,080
actually took the, the code, she took the, the IP from them.

2880
02:20:29,080 --> 02:20:31,680
Well, you know what I think about that?

2881
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:32,680
What?

2882
02:20:32,680 --> 02:20:40,040
Uh, yeah, uh, no, I, I, well, I don't know.

2883
02:20:40,040 --> 02:20:42,920
What do you think is this, is this justice that they have a right to go in and steal

2884
02:20:42,920 --> 02:20:44,400
the code that they made or no?

2885
02:20:44,400 --> 02:20:46,920
Well, I mean, the whole situation is in a gray area.

2886
02:20:46,920 --> 02:20:52,320
I mean, you have on one hand, according to that, according to that company, which is

2887
02:20:52,320 --> 02:21:00,480
a inner zone, they said that because they use a third party HR firm, they basically,

2888
02:21:00,480 --> 02:21:03,840
they basically, you know, they're shifting the blame on them because they screwed up

2889
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:11,720
all the, all the paperwork, legal paperwork with the Australian tax offices and especially,

2890
02:21:11,720 --> 02:21:14,880
you know, they're also blaming that country for not giving them the incentives that they

2891
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:20,880
were, that they were owed for actually, for actually setting up operations there.

2892
02:21:20,880 --> 02:21:24,200
And then you see the developers, you know, with their other side of the story where they

2893
02:21:24,200 --> 02:21:29,680
were, you know, overworked and to the point where they didn't even get paid at all.

2894
02:21:29,680 --> 02:21:35,840
They were literally working without a paycheck, which I mean, this is the, this is one of

2895
02:21:35,840 --> 02:21:40,960
those, you know, unfortunate tales of the video game industry where you have a developer

2896
02:21:40,960 --> 02:21:49,240
that tries to like, you know, cut, cut corners, even though he's trying to make a, trying

2897
02:21:49,240 --> 02:21:52,760
to make, in other words, he's trying to make it, he's trying to make a quick dollar by

2898
02:21:52,760 --> 02:21:57,840
trying to outsource things that normally most companies would be able to take care of on

2899
02:21:57,840 --> 02:21:58,840
their own.

2900
02:21:58,840 --> 02:22:01,280
Zaco, do you wear a hard hat when you call on the show?

2901
02:22:01,280 --> 02:22:02,280
Not really.

2902
02:22:02,280 --> 02:22:03,280
Oh, I was just curious.

2903
02:22:03,280 --> 02:22:07,800
Um, well, you know, if they're working for this company though, and the company is paying

2904
02:22:07,800 --> 02:22:11,280
them to do a job and the job is to write code for this game.

2905
02:22:11,280 --> 02:22:12,280
Okay.

2906
02:22:12,280 --> 02:22:13,280
Okay.

2907
02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:14,280
Are you ready?

2908
02:22:14,280 --> 02:22:18,520
The reason why Rob was making banging noises is because that's what it sounds like when

2909
02:22:18,520 --> 02:22:19,520
you type.

2910
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:24,920
Well, it's not my fault that the, the microphone is so close to the webcam on my Mac book.

2911
02:22:24,920 --> 02:22:25,920
All right.

2912
02:22:25,920 --> 02:22:30,360
I'm just saying that's why Rob was making the noises and asking about the hard hat.

2913
02:22:30,360 --> 02:22:31,920
I can't type fluently.

2914
02:22:31,920 --> 02:22:32,920
I'm more pecker.

2915
02:22:32,920 --> 02:22:37,240
Anyways, as we were saying, wait, did you just say you're a pecker?

2916
02:22:37,240 --> 02:22:45,000
I just, you know, you know, we, we give our favorite people the hardest time look in all

2917
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:49,880
services to answer the question or to respond to the, I guess the story about it is that,

2918
02:22:49,880 --> 02:22:55,100
you know, there's a certain kind of like yay hero to the story about them going in and

2919
02:22:55,100 --> 02:22:58,040
stealing this code because the developers are screwing them over.

2920
02:22:58,040 --> 02:23:02,320
But the bottom line is, you know, they, they are signing the checks and paying them to

2921
02:23:02,320 --> 02:23:04,280
write code for this game.

2922
02:23:04,280 --> 02:23:06,240
And if you know, it doesn't work out.

2923
02:23:06,240 --> 02:23:11,320
It's still owned by the people who sign those paychecks, but when you actually go for months

2924
02:23:11,320 --> 02:23:15,940
without paying your employee and just try to shift blame, you know, not make any, any

2925
02:23:15,940 --> 02:23:25,020
valiant effort to rectify the situation that, I mean, the owners falls on that company labor.

2926
02:23:25,020 --> 02:23:26,960
Is this an American company?

2927
02:23:26,960 --> 02:23:32,200
It's basically an American company, which you know, has supposedly has a studio in Australia.

2928
02:23:32,200 --> 02:23:34,700
They'll get, they'll get the pants suit off of them anyway.

2929
02:23:34,700 --> 02:23:40,560
I mean, right now the Australian tax board, you know, as I said, they, they're, they're

2930
02:23:40,560 --> 02:23:46,540
owed lots of, you know, back taxes because, you know, as I said, if they outsource human

2931
02:23:46,540 --> 02:23:52,520
resources and payroll to an Australian company that didn't do their job, it's the parent

2932
02:23:52,520 --> 02:23:57,800
company's responsibility to make sure that those taxes are paid and everything is settled

2933
02:23:57,800 --> 02:23:59,360
in whatever country they're operating.

2934
02:23:59,360 --> 02:24:03,760
I mean, this is, this applies for any other company that sets a shop anywhere else.

2935
02:24:03,760 --> 02:24:09,080
They have to play by the local, you know, they had to play by the local, yeah, the play

2936
02:24:09,080 --> 02:24:10,800
by the municipality's rules.

2937
02:24:10,800 --> 02:24:17,320
Like if I were to set up something, you know, if I were to set up a company in another country,

2938
02:24:17,320 --> 02:24:19,020
I'll be under their jurisdiction.

2939
02:24:19,020 --> 02:24:23,960
So I'd have to make sure that my company was running legitimately over there.

2940
02:24:23,960 --> 02:24:28,000
It'll be interesting to see all the lawsuits that go back and forth on this whole thing.

2941
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:32,520
But Zach, Zach, we gotta, we gotta wrap up and get to some other calls, but, um, thank

2942
02:24:32,520 --> 02:24:33,840
you very much for the call.

2943
02:24:33,840 --> 02:24:34,840
All right.

2944
02:24:34,840 --> 02:24:35,840
All right.

2945
02:24:35,840 --> 02:24:36,840
Later, dude.

2946
02:24:36,840 --> 02:24:37,840
All right.

2947
02:24:37,840 --> 02:24:38,840
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2948
02:24:38,840 --> 02:24:39,840
Who's this?

2949
02:24:39,840 --> 02:24:42,240
Um, hi, this is Elite Slayer.

2950
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:44,840
Hey, Elite Slayer, what's on your mind?

2951
02:24:44,840 --> 02:24:50,600
Um, well, I was actually, um, on, I was on my laptop earlier and we were starting to

2952
02:24:50,600 --> 02:24:57,420
talk about the, um, Halo Reach beta and we, and then they were like, oh, and they wanted

2953
02:24:57,420 --> 02:25:00,280
to know more about, you know, like the Halo storyline.

2954
02:25:00,280 --> 02:25:03,020
And I know a lot about like bungee in the storyline.

2955
02:25:03,020 --> 02:25:08,880
And so we started talking about it and then, um, this guy came on and then we got into

2956
02:25:08,880 --> 02:25:14,920
this full blown argument about whether there were Spartans left in the Halo saga when like

2957
02:25:14,920 --> 02:25:17,700
Halo three was happening or not.

2958
02:25:17,700 --> 02:25:24,000
And I was on the side of that there was because, you know, just thinking master chief was,

2959
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:31,120
um, he, and, uh, the whole storyline was kind of following him, but you never actually realized,

2960
02:25:31,120 --> 02:25:34,760
you know, kind of the other Spartans out there may have been left.

2961
02:25:34,760 --> 02:25:40,840
So, um, but the other guy was talking about this and I don't know where these facts are

2962
02:25:40,840 --> 02:25:45,920
coming up, but he said that, um, in Halo two and in Halo three, they're talking about how

2963
02:25:45,920 --> 02:25:50,560
he was the last Spartan and there was, um, no one else left.

2964
02:25:50,560 --> 02:25:53,440
And he was the only guy that could help this war.

2965
02:25:53,440 --> 02:25:56,840
And to be honest with you, I did not play Halo two.

2966
02:25:56,840 --> 02:26:01,880
Um, I mean, I've watched all the cut scenes and everything, but I didn't watch Halo.

2967
02:26:01,880 --> 02:26:04,600
I watched, I didn't play Halo two.

2968
02:26:04,600 --> 02:26:09,320
Um, even though, you know, I know it's, um, what's happening, you know, from the graphics

2969
02:26:09,320 --> 02:26:13,000
to the world's worst cliffhanger on there.

2970
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:18,140
But um, I just seriously don't know, this is driving me crazy about whether there's

2971
02:26:18,140 --> 02:26:24,920
Spartans left, um, whether there was actually Spartans left in Halo three or there wasn't,

2972
02:26:24,920 --> 02:26:31,240
I mean, um, is there like a place in the storyline that actually says there is or isn't because

2973
02:26:31,240 --> 02:26:35,560
how they're talking about how in Halo reach that's new coming up, you know, you can play

2974
02:26:35,560 --> 02:26:40,640
the beta on May 3rd now, um, when it comes up, but how they're talking about how he had

2975
02:26:40,640 --> 02:26:43,560
a squad and then they're thinking they all died.

2976
02:26:43,560 --> 02:26:44,680
You know, I just don't know.

2977
02:26:44,680 --> 02:26:47,240
It's driving me crazy to be honest with you.

2978
02:26:47,240 --> 02:26:50,000
Out of curiosity, do you have your own show?

2979
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:51,840
Cause you just talked for two minutes.

2980
02:26:51,840 --> 02:26:54,760
There was, is fascinating.

2981
02:26:54,760 --> 02:26:55,760
I mean, yeah.

2982
02:26:55,760 --> 02:27:00,920
Uh, you know, you can say I'm kind of the person that can, I can actually talk a lot,

2983
02:27:00,920 --> 02:27:03,840
but what I like to do for fun, like this may surprise you.

2984
02:27:03,840 --> 02:27:05,920
Um, I like to debate a lot.

2985
02:27:05,920 --> 02:27:10,800
I mean, I'm not kidding you.

2986
02:27:10,800 --> 02:27:15,140
People will, um, be like, they, after it's done, they're like, do you hate me now?

2987
02:27:15,140 --> 02:27:16,400
I'm like, no dude.

2988
02:27:16,400 --> 02:27:17,400
I just did that.

2989
02:27:17,400 --> 02:27:18,400
Cause I was pretty much bored.

2990
02:27:18,400 --> 02:27:25,320
I mean, that's it, you know, that's how, that's my personality to be honest with you.

2991
02:27:25,320 --> 02:27:30,720
But I don't, uh, lead Slayer, I'm going to answer your question quite, quite simply.

2992
02:27:30,720 --> 02:27:31,720
I don't know.

2993
02:27:31,720 --> 02:27:39,360
I, did you know, no, I wasn't paying attention to everything, but, uh, did you, um, happen

2994
02:27:39,360 --> 02:27:44,000
to catch the new Halo legends, uh, anime series that they had?

2995
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,360
Cause there's a lot of, uh, different backstory stuff.

2996
02:27:46,360 --> 02:27:51,680
I think in there too, it might, um, yeah, I'll tell you this though.

2997
02:27:51,680 --> 02:27:58,200
Um, I saw, I saw the first four episodes of Halo legends and I looked at it and I'm like,

2998
02:27:58,200 --> 02:28:02,800
Oh my God, you know, I'm like, where, cause a lot of the stuff there, it does go along

2999
02:28:02,800 --> 02:28:06,960
the series, but then it's like some of the stuff, you know, it's like they're pulling,

3000
02:28:06,960 --> 02:28:11,080
just pulling out of their ass, you know, I'm like, where did this come from?

3001
02:28:11,080 --> 02:28:16,440
Because in, um, the third episode, they're riding these motorbike things, um, in like

3002
02:28:16,440 --> 02:28:21,120
space and, um, just doesn't make any sense.

3003
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:26,480
Um, but, um, I'm starting to say I'm a lot, oh my God.

3004
02:28:26,480 --> 02:28:27,480
That's all right.

3005
02:28:27,480 --> 02:28:28,480
That's all right.

3006
02:28:28,480 --> 02:28:29,480
You're nervous.

3007
02:28:29,480 --> 02:28:30,480
It's a radio show.

3008
02:28:30,480 --> 02:28:31,480
Okay.

3009
02:28:31,480 --> 02:28:32,480
Wait before we got to wrap up here and go soon and I gotta be honest.

3010
02:28:32,480 --> 02:28:35,440
I don't know the answer to your Halo question, but maybe it's answered one of these books

3011
02:28:35,440 --> 02:28:36,440
or whatever.

3012
02:28:36,440 --> 02:28:37,440
Oh yeah.

3013
02:28:37,440 --> 02:28:39,800
There's books too on the whole Halo thing, but I want to, I want to debate you real quick

3014
02:28:39,800 --> 02:28:40,800
on a certain topic.

3015
02:28:40,800 --> 02:28:41,800
Okay.

3016
02:28:41,800 --> 02:28:46,240
Uh, since you're a big debate person, let's debate, uh, what, what is cooler keyboard

3017
02:28:46,240 --> 02:28:49,040
playing cats or keyboard playing dogs?

3018
02:28:49,040 --> 02:28:50,040
Okay.

3019
02:28:50,040 --> 02:28:52,040
And you start and take whatever side you want.

3020
02:28:52,040 --> 02:28:57,400
All right, dude, I got to go with, um, I, yeah, I heard your second on this earlier.

3021
02:28:57,400 --> 02:29:02,640
I got to say cats because just think cats, you've got low cap cats are crazy.

3022
02:29:02,640 --> 02:29:06,560
You got these animated gifts, you got all these things, you know, um, it's gotta be

3023
02:29:06,560 --> 02:29:07,720
one of a cool app.

3024
02:29:07,720 --> 02:29:12,120
Um, you know, everyone loves kittens, they're cute, they've got all this funny crap with

3025
02:29:12,120 --> 02:29:13,120
them.

3026
02:29:13,120 --> 02:29:14,120
They're swearing.

3027
02:29:14,120 --> 02:29:17,200
Kittens have, you know, they're just awesome.

3028
02:29:17,200 --> 02:29:18,200
Okay.

3029
02:29:18,200 --> 02:29:20,680
Well you're wrong and you're an idiot.

3030
02:29:20,680 --> 02:29:21,680
Okay.

3031
02:29:21,680 --> 02:29:22,680
Okay.

3032
02:29:22,680 --> 02:29:23,680
You're a liar.

3033
02:29:23,680 --> 02:29:24,680
Okay.

3034
02:29:24,680 --> 02:29:25,680
I got this.

3035
02:29:25,680 --> 02:29:26,680
Kittens are awesome.

3036
02:29:26,680 --> 02:29:34,440
I mean, I know I can sometimes be a dog person, but on, you know, online and iPhone, you know,

3037
02:29:34,440 --> 02:29:35,440
kittens are so much better.

3038
02:29:35,440 --> 02:29:38,360
They're funner, they lighten up your day.

3039
02:29:38,360 --> 02:29:40,400
I mean, they make you smile.

3040
02:29:40,400 --> 02:29:41,400
Come on.

3041
02:29:41,400 --> 02:29:43,400
It comes down to this.

3042
02:29:43,400 --> 02:29:44,400
Okay.

3043
02:29:44,400 --> 02:29:49,160
The easiest way you can determine which one's cooler, which is obviously cats, is because,

3044
02:29:49,160 --> 02:29:51,320
okay, dogs are trainable.

3045
02:29:51,320 --> 02:29:52,320
Cats are the untrainable.

3046
02:29:52,320 --> 02:29:53,320
Okay.

3047
02:29:53,320 --> 02:29:57,080
To train a cat to play a keyboard, well, force a cat to play keyboard.

3048
02:29:57,080 --> 02:29:58,080
Same thing.

3049
02:29:58,080 --> 02:30:01,200
Why are we even talking about this?

3050
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:02,200
Why?

3051
02:30:02,200 --> 02:30:03,200
It's so much cooler.

3052
02:30:03,200 --> 02:30:09,680
At least Slayer, this has been a heck of a call, but I've got to let you go so we can

3053
02:30:09,680 --> 02:30:11,760
get some more, but thank you for your call to the show.

3054
02:30:11,760 --> 02:30:12,760
Yeah.

3055
02:30:12,760 --> 02:30:13,760
Take care.

3056
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:14,760
Later, man.

3057
02:30:14,760 --> 02:30:16,400
You know what was awesome about that phone call?

3058
02:30:16,400 --> 02:30:19,820
Not a damn thing came of it.

3059
02:30:19,820 --> 02:30:24,120
We never even bothered to answer his question, but then he took two minutes to ask.

3060
02:30:24,120 --> 02:30:25,120
Dude, Wikipedia.

3061
02:30:25,120 --> 02:30:26,120
I don't.

3062
02:30:26,120 --> 02:30:27,120
Yeah.

3063
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:28,120
Halo Wiki.

3064
02:30:28,120 --> 02:30:29,120
All right.

3065
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:34,000
The whole chat room is going gong, gong, please end this, make it stop.

3066
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,720
Why are you doing this to me?

3067
02:30:36,720 --> 02:30:41,480
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

3068
02:30:41,480 --> 02:30:42,480
Who's this?

3069
02:30:42,480 --> 02:30:46,960
This is somebody that's not going to fap into a keyboard or sit there and get a stupid conversation

3070
02:30:46,960 --> 02:30:48,560
about stupid stuff like Halo.

3071
02:30:48,560 --> 02:30:49,560
Are you sure?

3072
02:30:49,560 --> 02:30:51,040
Oh, I'm definitely sure.

3073
02:30:51,040 --> 02:30:52,240
Dude, really?

3074
02:30:52,240 --> 02:30:53,240
What's on your mind?

3075
02:30:53,240 --> 02:30:54,240
Who is this?

3076
02:30:54,240 --> 02:30:55,240
What's up, guys?

3077
02:30:55,240 --> 02:30:56,240
This is excellent.

3078
02:30:56,240 --> 02:30:57,240
This is excellent.

3079
02:30:57,240 --> 02:30:59,320
Hey, X-Link, what's on your mind?

3080
02:30:59,320 --> 02:31:01,320
Nothing much, man.

3081
02:31:01,320 --> 02:31:05,880
Just getting ready to shoot myself in the head with DS, calling every... Oh, I'm not

3082
02:31:05,880 --> 02:31:06,880
going to get to it, seriously.

3083
02:31:06,880 --> 02:31:07,880
Hey, X-Link.

3084
02:31:07,880 --> 02:31:08,920
Just thinking about this.

3085
02:31:08,920 --> 02:31:11,120
It's the show where every gamer has a voice.

3086
02:31:11,120 --> 02:31:12,120
No, it's going to be soon.

3087
02:31:12,120 --> 02:31:13,120
It's going to be called.

3088
02:31:13,120 --> 02:31:16,080
The next time you go in a while, I'm going to put a hit on you with every single Horde

3089
02:31:16,080 --> 02:31:20,440
member going after you for surprise money for putting DS Master on the line.

3090
02:31:20,440 --> 02:31:25,000
It's going to be like an episode of the Guild, which, by the way, tangent, I watched the

3091
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:30,120
entirety of season one and two of the Guild last night with Alan, because everything was

3092
02:31:30,120 --> 02:31:33,360
packed except for the computer, because if you're a nerd, the computer's the last thing

3093
02:31:33,360 --> 02:31:34,360
you pack.

3094
02:31:34,360 --> 02:31:38,480
So all I had was instant Netflix, because the PS3 was packed, all the DVDs were packed.

3095
02:31:38,480 --> 02:31:39,480
So we decided to watch instant Netflix.

3096
02:31:39,480 --> 02:31:43,360
I don't know if you know, but the Guild is now available seasons one and two on Netflix,

3097
02:31:43,360 --> 02:31:46,280
and you just kind of reminded me of one of the episodes where one of the guildies is

3098
02:31:46,280 --> 02:31:51,540
kind of leading a secret double life to make one of the other Guild members that she's

3099
02:31:51,540 --> 02:31:53,920
mad at make his life hell.

3100
02:31:53,920 --> 02:31:54,920
I don't know.

3101
02:31:54,920 --> 02:31:55,920
What did you think of the Guild?

3102
02:31:55,920 --> 02:31:56,920
Oh, I loved it.

3103
02:31:56,920 --> 02:31:57,920
I loved that show.

3104
02:31:57,920 --> 02:31:58,920
Oh, you've seen it, X-Link?

3105
02:31:58,920 --> 02:31:59,920
I'm sorry?

3106
02:31:59,920 --> 02:32:00,920
You've seen it, X-Link?

3107
02:32:00,920 --> 02:32:01,920
Oh, yes.

3108
02:32:01,920 --> 02:32:02,920
Yes, definitely.

3109
02:32:02,920 --> 02:32:03,920
Yeah.

3110
02:32:03,920 --> 02:32:04,920
I've seen both seasons.

3111
02:32:04,920 --> 02:32:05,920
Yes.

3112
02:32:05,920 --> 02:32:06,920
It's a little bit over the top for me.

3113
02:32:06,920 --> 02:32:12,560
Like, some of it's just, like, a little too out there, but, you know, for nerd lols, it's

3114
02:32:12,560 --> 02:32:13,560
pretty good.

3115
02:32:13,560 --> 02:32:14,560
What did you think, Alan?

3116
02:32:14,560 --> 02:32:15,560
You watched it too with me.

3117
02:32:15,560 --> 02:32:16,560
Did you like it, or was it a little like-

3118
02:32:16,560 --> 02:32:17,560
Yeah, it was good.

3119
02:32:17,560 --> 02:32:20,480
I've been on WoW for about two or three months, so I get all the jokes now.

3120
02:32:20,480 --> 02:32:21,480
Oh, there you go.

3121
02:32:21,480 --> 02:32:24,000
All right, what did you really call in to talk about tonight?

3122
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:31,880
No, I was calling about Ubisoft and what bastardization they're doing with the whole DRM and stuff.

3123
02:32:31,880 --> 02:32:35,920
You know, like I said before, and besides the Imagination series and stuff like that,

3124
02:32:35,920 --> 02:32:38,800
don't forget they also did, like, the CSI series.

3125
02:32:38,800 --> 02:32:44,760
They were also part of, you know, the Press Your Luck, which, oh, yeah, thanks Ubisoft.

3126
02:32:44,760 --> 02:32:47,360
Now I can't now play any of those cool game show games.

3127
02:32:47,360 --> 02:32:49,360
You just hit a whammy.

3128
02:32:49,360 --> 02:32:50,360
Congrats.

3129
02:32:50,360 --> 02:32:51,360
Yeah.

3130
02:32:51,360 --> 02:32:53,080
So now you're going to stop me from playing Addis as well.

3131
02:32:53,080 --> 02:32:56,640
And my mom, because my mom likes a series of games, so you're going to make her stop

3132
02:32:56,640 --> 02:32:59,740
because she doesn't have an internet connection in her place, so.

3133
02:32:59,740 --> 02:33:04,200
Bravo on that, I know there's going to be a patch and there's going to be ways of getting

3134
02:33:04,200 --> 02:33:07,680
around it, so I'm not the least bit worried, but still, I mean, it's just the fact that

3135
02:33:07,680 --> 02:33:10,320
it's going to be a headache just before all that, you know?

3136
02:33:10,320 --> 02:33:12,160
And like you said before, it's going to be a headache.

3137
02:33:12,160 --> 02:33:15,940
You're going to have all these people who doesn't know all these different ways around

3138
02:33:15,940 --> 02:33:16,940
it.

3139
02:33:16,940 --> 02:33:19,400
They're going to sit here and they're going to— yeah, they're going to flood the support

3140
02:33:19,400 --> 02:33:21,040
lines because of all this, you know.

3141
02:33:21,040 --> 02:33:24,920
And you can't take a PC game back to the store, so best of luck on that.

3142
02:33:24,920 --> 02:33:25,920
Nope.

3143
02:33:25,920 --> 02:33:26,920
So, I...

3144
02:33:26,920 --> 02:33:27,920
I do...

3145
02:33:27,920 --> 02:33:30,040
Do you think, though, that it's gonna work?

3146
02:33:30,040 --> 02:33:32,680
I mean, don't you think it's just gonna get cracked within a couple days?

3147
02:33:32,680 --> 02:33:33,680
I mean...

3148
02:33:33,680 --> 02:33:37,240
Yeah, it will get cracked, but you gotta realize, too, a lot of people don't know this difference

3149
02:33:37,240 --> 02:33:38,240
of what we do.

3150
02:33:38,240 --> 02:33:41,460
And a lot of the people, I'm gonna feel bad for because they're gonna buy the game.

3151
02:33:41,460 --> 02:33:42,460
They're gonna open it up.

3152
02:33:42,460 --> 02:33:43,460
They're gonna put it in.

3153
02:33:43,460 --> 02:33:44,460
They're not realizing this is gonna happen.

3154
02:33:44,460 --> 02:33:47,920
And once they realize it's gonna happen, they're gonna try to take it back to the store and

3155
02:33:47,920 --> 02:33:48,920
they're gonna be like...

3156
02:33:48,920 --> 02:33:50,560
The store's gonna be like, sorry, that's tough.

3157
02:33:50,560 --> 02:33:51,880
You should have known that beforehand.

3158
02:33:51,880 --> 02:33:54,640
I think you and I are on the same page there.

3159
02:33:54,640 --> 02:33:56,720
You don't wanna debate me like the last caller did.

3160
02:33:56,720 --> 02:33:57,720
That's...

3161
02:33:57,720 --> 02:33:58,720
Nah.

3162
02:33:58,720 --> 02:33:59,720
Yeah.

3163
02:33:59,720 --> 02:34:00,720
Boring.

3164
02:34:00,720 --> 02:34:01,720
I know.

3165
02:34:01,720 --> 02:34:02,720
All right.

3166
02:34:02,720 --> 02:34:03,720
Well, what else is...

3167
02:34:03,720 --> 02:34:04,720
Sorry.

3168
02:34:04,720 --> 02:34:05,720
Anything else on your mind tonight, X-Link, before I let you go?

3169
02:34:05,720 --> 02:34:06,720
No, that was pretty much about it.

3170
02:34:06,720 --> 02:34:09,040
I just thought it was kind of interesting when I was hearing about all that, you know.

3171
02:34:09,040 --> 02:34:12,120
You know, there's more games than just the Imagination series and...

3172
02:34:12,120 --> 02:34:15,420
You know, with all these things we're seeing, you know, with... between the Ubisoft news

3173
02:34:15,420 --> 02:34:18,420
and then we're talking about the whole... what was it?

3174
02:34:18,420 --> 02:34:22,760
SOCOM or whatever that game is on PSP that's gonna have the multiplayer's gonna charge

3175
02:34:22,760 --> 02:34:25,140
if you didn't buy it new.

3176
02:34:25,140 --> 02:34:27,080
You're gonna see all these inventive things.

3177
02:34:27,080 --> 02:34:29,600
It's just... it's not even the beginning of the end.

3178
02:34:29,600 --> 02:34:30,600
Not even.

3179
02:34:30,600 --> 02:34:34,800
And the interesting thing about that would be that also is I would love to see the responses

3180
02:34:34,800 --> 02:34:37,220
from people from eBay that don't know about it.

3181
02:34:37,220 --> 02:34:41,080
They buy the game you use for their son or something and then they figure out, you know,

3182
02:34:41,080 --> 02:34:44,040
the son wants to play multiplayer and figure out they have to charge another $20 for it

3183
02:34:44,040 --> 02:34:45,040
to get the multiplayer.

3184
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:46,040
Yeah.

3185
02:34:46,040 --> 02:34:47,040
That's gonna be interesting to see the results on that.

3186
02:34:47,040 --> 02:34:48,040
So...

3187
02:34:48,040 --> 02:34:52,080
That's gonna be interesting as in about like a 20 car pile up on the side of the road.

3188
02:34:52,080 --> 02:34:53,080
Alright, X-Link.

3189
02:34:53,080 --> 02:34:54,080
Gotta let you go, buddy.

3190
02:34:54,080 --> 02:34:55,080
Have a good one.

3191
02:34:55,080 --> 02:34:56,080
No problem.

3192
02:34:56,080 --> 02:34:57,080
You too.

3193
02:34:57,080 --> 02:34:58,080
Bye.

3194
02:34:58,080 --> 02:34:59,080
We just have call after call tonight.

3195
02:34:59,080 --> 02:35:00,080
Let's go to another call.

3196
02:35:00,080 --> 02:35:01,080
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

3197
02:35:01,080 --> 02:35:02,080
Who's this?

3198
02:35:02,080 --> 02:35:03,080
Hey, folks.

3199
02:35:03,080 --> 02:35:04,080
It's SSJ100 Matt.

3200
02:35:04,080 --> 02:35:05,080
Hi, SSJ100 Matt.

3201
02:35:05,080 --> 02:35:07,960
What's on your mind tonight?

3202
02:35:07,960 --> 02:35:08,960
Not much.

3203
02:35:08,960 --> 02:35:10,280
Definitely not Halo Reach.

3204
02:35:10,280 --> 02:35:15,160
But by the way, Zaku... keyboard Zaku cats are better.

3205
02:35:15,160 --> 02:35:17,040
Oh, I see.

3206
02:35:17,040 --> 02:35:19,880
When it talks about keyboard cat and dog cat, Zaku cat wins.

3207
02:35:19,880 --> 02:35:20,880
That's fair.

3208
02:35:20,880 --> 02:35:21,880
Did you say dog cat?

3209
02:35:21,880 --> 02:35:22,880
Did I say dog cat?

3210
02:35:22,880 --> 02:35:23,880
I probably did.

3211
02:35:23,880 --> 02:35:24,880
You said dog cat?

3212
02:35:24,880 --> 02:35:25,880
I probably did say dog cat.

3213
02:35:25,880 --> 02:35:30,280
Well, you know, SSJ100 Matt now is gonna make me think of the whole shark and octopus videos

3214
02:35:30,280 --> 02:35:35,760
with all the YouTubes he was linking tonight, which were A-plus videos, by the way.

3215
02:35:35,760 --> 02:35:40,440
When you can get videos to get a laugh on a radio show, you've done a good job.

3216
02:35:40,440 --> 02:35:41,440
Yeah.

3217
02:35:41,440 --> 02:35:42,440
So...

3218
02:35:42,440 --> 02:35:46,440
Actually, the one thing I did want to talk about is, that will actually get us to debate.

3219
02:35:46,440 --> 02:35:51,240
You know, I'm talking about the... the USL madness going on in the forums.

3220
02:35:51,240 --> 02:35:52,240
Uh-huh, yes.

3221
02:35:52,240 --> 02:35:55,960
We played a little promo from Bresloh a little earlier.

3222
02:35:55,960 --> 02:35:57,640
What do you think about what's going on there?

3223
02:35:57,640 --> 02:35:58,640
Well, I'm just...

3224
02:35:58,640 --> 02:36:03,800
I'm just kind of amazed at just the amount of, like, hate that's going on in there.

3225
02:36:03,800 --> 02:36:09,640
Like, right now, Pokemon is beating Final Fantasy VII nine votes to four.

3226
02:36:09,640 --> 02:36:10,640
Mm-hmm.

3227
02:36:10,640 --> 02:36:16,240
Now, my question is, are a lot of people just voting against Final Fantasy VII because they

3228
02:36:16,240 --> 02:36:20,800
just hate the fact that it's overhyped or...

3229
02:36:20,800 --> 02:36:21,800
I don't know.

3230
02:36:21,800 --> 02:36:27,480
I think there's, like, a large generation of, like, modern fans that really just do

3231
02:36:27,480 --> 02:36:29,520
not like Final Fantasy VII.

3232
02:36:29,520 --> 02:36:30,880
I think it's a little bit of both.

3233
02:36:30,880 --> 02:36:34,720
I think you have some genuine Pokemon fans, but I think some of that is anti-Final Fantasy

3234
02:36:34,720 --> 02:36:35,720
VII votes, too.

3235
02:36:35,720 --> 02:36:39,360
I think, like, any great political race, there's something like that going on there.

3236
02:36:39,360 --> 02:36:43,960
I wish there was more of a sampling of our audience voting in those polls, but what can

3237
02:36:43,960 --> 02:36:44,960
you do?

3238
02:36:44,960 --> 02:36:45,960
Yeah.

3239
02:36:45,960 --> 02:36:50,000
I mean, obviously, you know, we got Symphony of the Night losing to Legend of Zelda, which,

3240
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,320
you know, that's a good matchup, so...

3241
02:36:52,320 --> 02:36:55,040
Yeah, you know, I can't get mad about that.

3242
02:36:55,040 --> 02:36:57,160
To be honest, I can't get mad about the Pokemon one, too.

3243
02:36:57,160 --> 02:36:59,080
I realize Pokemon has its rabid fanbase.

3244
02:36:59,080 --> 02:37:02,560
I mean, the anime is still going, and it's been going for, what, like, at least, like,

3245
02:37:02,560 --> 02:37:03,560
ten years now?

3246
02:37:03,560 --> 02:37:06,040
I mean, the anime is just not losing steam, and I get it.

3247
02:37:06,040 --> 02:37:07,040
You know, I don't...

3248
02:37:07,040 --> 02:37:10,200
Like, if it was losing to a game like, I don't know, Blades of Steel...

3249
02:37:10,200 --> 02:37:13,840
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on there.

3250
02:37:13,840 --> 02:37:14,840
Hold on there.

3251
02:37:14,840 --> 02:37:15,840
Listen here.

3252
02:37:15,840 --> 02:37:16,840
Okay.

3253
02:37:16,840 --> 02:37:17,840
I just wanted to start something.

3254
02:37:17,840 --> 02:37:18,840
Yeah.

3255
02:37:18,840 --> 02:37:23,600
But, um, no, I mean, my point is, you know, if you genuinely like Pokemon and think it's

3256
02:37:23,600 --> 02:37:26,840
a better game, then I'm cool with that, but, you know, if you just, like, if you're boning

3257
02:37:26,840 --> 02:37:32,840
against a game that, you know, just because it's overhyped or everyone likes it, you know,

3258
02:37:32,840 --> 02:37:34,520
like you said, haters to the left.

3259
02:37:34,520 --> 02:37:35,520
Yes, exactly.

3260
02:37:35,520 --> 02:37:36,520
Haters gonna hate.

3261
02:37:36,520 --> 02:37:39,800
You know, I'm okay with Final Fantasy VII taking a step back.

3262
02:37:39,800 --> 02:37:40,800
I mean, it's what?

3263
02:37:40,800 --> 02:37:43,840
We're down to, what, 32 games, so if it doesn't make the top 16, oh, well, it probably wouldn't

3264
02:37:43,840 --> 02:37:45,160
be in my top 16, either.

3265
02:37:45,160 --> 02:37:47,720
There's other Final Fantasy games I think were better than VII.

3266
02:37:47,720 --> 02:37:51,440
I love Final Fantasy VI, I love Final Fantasy IV, I would place both those games, and I

3267
02:37:51,440 --> 02:37:56,200
think VI is still in it, so, you know, I'm okay that if VII's out this round and one

3268
02:37:56,200 --> 02:37:59,840
of the other Final Fantasy games continues, but what's weird about the whole setup of

3269
02:37:59,840 --> 02:38:04,400
the way, and it's just, I guess, the way the cards fell, and I know Jon has this very specific

3270
02:38:04,400 --> 02:38:10,520
way of seeding everything in the match, but it's really weird how, like, three Mario games

3271
02:38:10,520 --> 02:38:16,720
and, like, three Zelda games are likely to take up the top 32.

3272
02:38:16,720 --> 02:38:17,720
It's-

3273
02:38:17,720 --> 02:38:21,240
Then again, you know, maybe Zelda and Mario shouldn't be so good.

3274
02:38:21,240 --> 02:38:25,220
I know, I know they're good games, I get it, but it's just weird, and I think maybe I'm

3275
02:38:25,220 --> 02:38:30,080
saying that because some of the games got grouped as series and some didn't, but I'm

3276
02:38:30,080 --> 02:38:33,680
sure it had a lot to do with how people's lists were, like, I know, like, if you even

3277
02:38:33,680 --> 02:38:37,060
look at my list, I probably did have two different Zelda games on it and two different Mario

3278
02:38:37,060 --> 02:38:38,060
games on it.

3279
02:38:38,060 --> 02:38:41,200
So, they are really good series, but it's just interesting that we're down to, like,

3280
02:38:41,200 --> 02:38:44,920
you know, we're gonna be down to 16 and, like, half of that is gonna be Zelda and Mario.

3281
02:38:44,920 --> 02:38:48,460
Hey, you know, listen, I put Blades of Steel as number one.

3282
02:38:48,460 --> 02:38:49,460
I know you do.

3283
02:38:49,460 --> 02:38:53,600
Kinda jokingly, but, you know, I, if you saw, you know, I wrote a ridiculous manifesto,

3284
02:38:53,600 --> 02:38:54,600
just jokingly, but, you know.

3285
02:38:54,600 --> 02:38:56,680
No, I know, and Blades of Steel was a great game.

3286
02:38:56,680 --> 02:38:57,680
You know what?

3287
02:38:57,680 --> 02:38:58,680
I don't play a lot of sports games.

3288
02:38:58,680 --> 02:39:01,320
I really don't, but I owned Blades of Steel on the NES.

3289
02:39:01,320 --> 02:39:02,320
That's how good it was.

3290
02:39:02,320 --> 02:39:03,320
It was a great game.

3291
02:39:03,320 --> 02:39:04,320
Exactly.

3292
02:39:04,320 --> 02:39:05,320
And it had Groddies.

3293
02:39:05,320 --> 02:39:06,320
Only sports games I've ever known.

3294
02:39:06,320 --> 02:39:07,320
Groddies minigame.

3295
02:39:07,320 --> 02:39:08,320
So, we're gonna wrap things up.

3296
02:39:08,320 --> 02:39:09,320
But thanks so much for your call.

3297
02:39:09,320 --> 02:39:10,320
Yup.

3298
02:39:10,320 --> 02:39:11,320
Take it easy.

3299
02:39:11,320 --> 02:39:12,320
Have a good one.

3300
02:39:12,320 --> 02:39:13,320
All right.

3301
02:39:13,320 --> 02:39:14,320
Apologies to those that didn't get through tonight.

3302
02:39:14,320 --> 02:39:15,320
We took, like, four calls tonight.

3303
02:39:15,320 --> 02:39:19,680
Usually, when I take three, so, uh, send us an email if you didn't get through or a tweet.

3304
02:39:19,680 --> 02:39:23,460
We always appreciate those and, uh, we'll talk to you guys, hopefully, next time on

3305
02:39:23,460 --> 02:39:26,520
Orange Lounge Radio, but many, many different ways to interact with the show.

3306
02:39:26,520 --> 02:39:29,960
Chat room, Twitter, all that good stuff.

3307
02:39:29,960 --> 02:39:33,840
I'm glad, I think all the calls we got tonight were people that weren't on last week, so

3308
02:39:33,840 --> 02:39:36,720
it's good to kind of, or maybe Zaku was, I don't know, but it's good to kind of spread

3309
02:39:36,720 --> 02:39:37,720
the love a little bit.

3310
02:39:37,720 --> 02:39:38,720
So.

3311
02:39:38,720 --> 02:39:39,720
All right.

3312
02:39:39,720 --> 02:39:42,080
Um, we're gonna go around and, uh, kind of start to wrap up the show, but first we gotta

3313
02:39:42,080 --> 02:39:44,320
make sure all of our last minute stories are cleared out.

3314
02:39:44,320 --> 02:39:46,800
Uh, anything else you guys want to bring up tonight, Loki?

3315
02:39:46,800 --> 02:39:47,800
Dark Sakura?

3316
02:39:47,800 --> 02:39:49,800
I like chocolate.

3317
02:39:49,800 --> 02:39:51,800
That's not a news breaking story.

3318
02:39:51,800 --> 02:39:59,000
There's a few things, uh, from, um, AOU 2010, uh, the Arcade Expo that's in, uh, Japan.

3319
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:02,240
They're showing off some of the new things including Sega is bringing, uh, Project Diva

3320
02:40:02,240 --> 02:40:03,240
to the arcades.

3321
02:40:03,240 --> 02:40:04,240
Yay!

3322
02:40:04,240 --> 02:40:12,920
Um, rhythm music game kind of looks a little bit like a cross between, um, I don't know,

3323
02:40:12,920 --> 02:40:20,560
something like maybe like a per-appetite game with, um, oh wow, that Namco singing game.

3324
02:40:20,560 --> 02:40:21,560
I don't know.

3325
02:40:21,560 --> 02:40:26,320
Basically, it's just, you know, like a music rhythm game with, uh, chicks singing stuff.

3326
02:40:26,320 --> 02:40:27,800
Um, it looks neat.

3327
02:40:27,800 --> 02:40:31,860
It's got these, um, not really popping music buttons, but it's basically got four buttons

3328
02:40:31,860 --> 02:40:36,620
that kind of match the, uh, PlayStation face buttons.

3329
02:40:36,620 --> 02:40:38,080
So that's kind of neat.

3330
02:40:38,080 --> 02:40:41,440
And that'll become an arcades imagined pretty soon.

3331
02:40:41,440 --> 02:40:46,280
Uh, another one that they showed off that was actually really huge, um, was Metal Gear

3332
02:40:46,280 --> 02:40:47,280
Arcade.

3333
02:40:47,280 --> 02:40:50,040
With, talk about one hell of a complex cabinet.

3334
02:40:50,040 --> 02:40:51,760
Oh yeah, I've heard about this.

3335
02:40:51,760 --> 02:40:59,700
It's got, like, these 3D glasses, head tracking, um, built into those, like, it's like a goggle

3336
02:40:59,700 --> 02:41:00,700
type thing.

3337
02:41:00,700 --> 02:41:07,920
Um, you have a gun that you use and just talk about, well, that's just begging to get broken.

3338
02:41:07,920 --> 02:41:09,720
Yeah, talk about details.

3339
02:41:09,720 --> 02:41:11,720
So that's kind of cool.

3340
02:41:11,720 --> 02:41:14,760
Um, I don't know when that's going to be coming out.

3341
02:41:14,760 --> 02:41:20,000
Uh, then we were talking, there's, uh, apparently there was some concern because of the rumors

3342
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:23,800
that Final Fantasy XIV is coming out this year, that Final Fantasy XI will be going

3343
02:41:23,800 --> 02:41:26,520
by the wayside, um, with the release of that.

3344
02:41:26,520 --> 02:41:27,880
Is that for real?

3345
02:41:27,880 --> 02:41:31,980
Because I, I did remember before I had no internet after the move, I remember reading

3346
02:41:31,980 --> 02:41:35,360
that story and I was like, there's no official word from Square Enix, this seems like a rumor

3347
02:41:35,360 --> 02:41:36,360
run wild.

3348
02:41:36,360 --> 02:41:39,400
It just, uh, well, that's the thing, it's, it's not, it's not going to be going by the

3349
02:41:39,400 --> 02:41:40,400
wayside.

3350
02:41:40,400 --> 02:41:41,400
Oh, thank God.

3351
02:41:41,400 --> 02:41:45,680
Uh, Wada, uh, tweeted, uh, there seems to be a rumor that Final Fantasy XI is ending,

3352
02:41:45,680 --> 02:41:49,200
but if that was done, we're, uh, we'd be in trouble.

3353
02:41:49,200 --> 02:41:50,200
Um.

3354
02:41:50,200 --> 02:41:52,920
Well, if it's on Twitter, then you know it's true.

3355
02:41:52,920 --> 02:41:56,780
If it's coming from, you know, uh, Yoji Wada.

3356
02:41:56,780 --> 02:42:01,340
In this case, if it's coming from a verified dude's account, I think there's really no

3357
02:42:01,340 --> 02:42:02,340
dispute in that, I guess.

3358
02:42:02,340 --> 02:42:03,340
Yoji Wada.

3359
02:42:03,340 --> 02:42:08,260
Um, so I guess, no, they can't shut down 11 right now just to make room for 14 EverQuest

3360
02:42:08,260 --> 02:42:12,640
one and two ran at the same time and you know, all these other ones that have sequels, city

3361
02:42:12,640 --> 02:42:14,900
heroes and villains are running at the same time.

3362
02:42:14,900 --> 02:42:18,260
You know, one's not going to close because the other is out.

3363
02:42:18,260 --> 02:42:23,680
Might there be server consolidations because there's going to be a, yeah, that could happen

3364
02:42:23,680 --> 02:42:24,680
and probably will happen.

3365
02:42:24,680 --> 02:42:28,880
I bet 11 has a server consolidation by the end of the year, but it's not going to close.

3366
02:42:28,880 --> 02:42:29,880
Not going to close.

3367
02:42:29,880 --> 02:42:35,400
Um, and then the last thing, um, you remember, uh, that we mentioned that Perfect Dark would

3368
02:42:35,400 --> 02:42:37,880
be coming to Xbox Live Arcade during March.

3369
02:42:37,880 --> 02:42:45,540
Well with that will be the GoldenEye 007 maps from, um, the game on Nintendo 64.

3370
02:42:45,540 --> 02:42:49,000
Those will be also coming to Perfect Dark as well as possibly the weapons.

3371
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:54,240
Sneaky, sneaky, sneaky way to get GoldenEye content on the Xbox without having to do all

3372
02:42:54,240 --> 02:42:55,240
the licenses.

3373
02:42:55,240 --> 02:42:56,240
There you go.

3374
02:42:56,240 --> 02:42:57,240
I like the way they think.

3375
02:42:57,240 --> 02:42:58,240
Next best thing.

3376
02:42:58,240 --> 02:42:59,240
Good job.

3377
02:42:59,240 --> 02:43:00,240
That's it.

3378
02:43:00,240 --> 02:43:01,240
All right.

3379
02:43:01,240 --> 02:43:04,920
Well, if that does it for a last minute stories, then it's the part of the show.

3380
02:43:04,920 --> 02:43:08,060
We're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

3381
02:43:08,060 --> 02:43:09,760
So Alan, we'll start with you.

3382
02:43:09,760 --> 02:43:11,360
Thank you so much for coming and being on the show tonight.

3383
02:43:11,360 --> 02:43:15,800
I know you didn't get to say a whole lot, but I hope you had fun sitting in here and

3384
02:43:15,800 --> 02:43:16,800
sitting in.

3385
02:43:16,800 --> 02:43:17,800
Thanks for having me.

3386
02:43:17,800 --> 02:43:18,800
No problem.

3387
02:43:18,800 --> 02:43:21,360
Come again sometime and, and, and don't be afraid to speak your mind.

3388
02:43:21,360 --> 02:43:23,880
It's where every gamer has a voice, Alan, even yours.

3389
02:43:23,880 --> 02:43:25,760
So do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

3390
02:43:25,760 --> 02:43:27,840
My cat's breath smells like cat food.

3391
02:43:27,840 --> 02:43:28,840
Okay.

3392
02:43:28,840 --> 02:43:29,840
Yeah.

3393
02:43:29,840 --> 02:43:30,840
Uh, Loki, your final thought tonight?

3394
02:43:30,840 --> 02:43:35,640
Uh, my final thought is I get to take off work tomorrow cause I am sick.

3395
02:43:35,640 --> 02:43:40,920
My final thought is looking at the Dragon Quest slime on Dan's desk kind of makes me

3396
02:43:40,920 --> 02:43:42,600
want to play Dragon Quest eight.

3397
02:43:42,600 --> 02:43:44,960
I don't know why, but it was kind of cool.

3398
02:43:44,960 --> 02:43:46,640
Dark Sakura, your final thought.

3399
02:43:46,640 --> 02:43:53,440
I'm totally addicted to this, uh, Sailor Senshi doll maker.

3400
02:43:53,440 --> 02:43:57,360
You are the reason Ubisoft has a market for those designer dress games.

3401
02:43:57,360 --> 02:43:58,360
No, I'm kidding.

3402
02:43:58,360 --> 02:44:00,160
Uh, probably you're right.

3403
02:44:00,160 --> 02:44:02,760
Actually, I'm kind of jealous watching you play.

3404
02:44:02,760 --> 02:44:07,480
No, thanks a lot of course for tuning into our show and supporting and downloading and

3405
02:44:07,480 --> 02:44:08,960
listening to independent radio.

3406
02:44:08,960 --> 02:44:09,960
We really appreciate it.

3407
02:44:09,960 --> 02:44:11,200
We do this show for free.

3408
02:44:11,200 --> 02:44:14,920
All we ask if you enjoyed what you heard, tell a friend about the show, help spread

3409
02:44:14,920 --> 02:44:16,360
the word about orange lounge radio.

3410
02:44:16,360 --> 02:44:17,740
We really appreciate it.

3411
02:44:17,740 --> 02:44:22,000
And you know what, you know what else helps leaving reviews on iTunes or links.

3412
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:26,600
Some of you plug us in like forum signatures and stuff, even if it's like a little banner

3413
02:44:26,600 --> 02:44:28,040
that's like, I listen to LR.

3414
02:44:28,040 --> 02:44:31,920
We think that kind of stuff is really cool and really makes the, this whole thing worth

3415
02:44:31,920 --> 02:44:32,920
it.

3416
02:44:32,920 --> 02:44:36,280
So, uh, uh, even when it's an off night like tonight, but you know what, the whole chat

3417
02:44:36,280 --> 02:44:37,440
room seems to be into it.

3418
02:44:37,440 --> 02:44:38,440
So Hey, good times.

3419
02:44:38,440 --> 02:44:39,880
Uh, thank you guys.

3420
02:44:39,880 --> 02:44:42,960
