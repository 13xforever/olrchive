[SPEAKER_11]: One and only.

9
00:00:57,355 --> 00:00:59,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, one and only sidekick.

10
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:01,738
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, because I always introduce Loki as Tech Master Loki.

11
00:01:01,778 --> 00:01:03,759
[SPEAKER_05]: He's still a co-host, but that's just the way it is.

12
00:01:03,779 --> 00:01:04,660
[SPEAKER_11]: You made him spit out his chicken.

13
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,180
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

14
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki knows I love him.

15
00:01:07,281 --> 00:01:08,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Not in a, you know, no homo.

16
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:12,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that what the rappers say now?

17
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:18,689
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I was seeing something the other day where, I don't know, some rappers were talking about, you know, yeah, yeah, you look really good in that outfit, no homo.

18
00:01:19,269 --> 00:01:22,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I am a homo, if you haven't already heard, so whatever.

19
00:01:23,312 --> 00:01:25,093
[SPEAKER_05]: This show's off to a very strange start already tonight.

20
00:01:25,113 --> 00:01:26,434
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just the bandwidth issues, is it?

21
00:01:27,514 --> 00:01:29,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so anyway, how you doing, DarkSakura?

22
00:01:29,635 --> 00:01:30,156
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing.

23
00:01:30,336 --> 00:01:30,656
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

24
00:01:31,096 --> 00:01:34,538
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, the one and only Techmaster Loki is here as well.

25
00:01:34,758 --> 00:01:35,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

26
00:01:35,238 --> 00:01:35,879
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing, Loki?

27
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:36,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:37,199
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

29
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:44,583
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to be talking video games, of course, over the next few hours with you guys at our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

30
00:01:44,603 --> 00:01:46,044
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to apologize in advance.

31
00:01:46,484 --> 00:01:49,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Live radio tonight, I don't know what's going on.

32
00:01:49,626 --> 00:01:52,747
[SPEAKER_05]: We're having some bandwidth issues on all games, and I think it's kind of why we're off.

33
00:01:53,087 --> 00:01:54,168
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not all games' fault, though.

34
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:56,169
[SPEAKER_05]: They're perfect, because Bobby had a flawless show last night.

35
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:57,169
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Luke, Carameldansen

36
00:02:24,597 --> 00:02:42,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so we also have a special guest here in the studio tonight And it's not often we get guests at Studio DarkSakura, besides Shermie of course But sometimes you have Dan, and I know Tiara's been here before as well But tonight we have another special guest, say hello everybody to Salacious Pop Hello, how are you?

37
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,220
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm good, how are you?

38
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:52,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Good, now it's funny that I was talking about Nohomo earlier Because Salacious Pop happens to be my boyfriend That's right, I brought my boyfriend to the show tonight, so how are you?

00:02:52,982 --> 00:02:53,363
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm great.

40
00:02:53,523 --> 00:02:53,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

41
00:02:54,123 --> 00:02:58,527
[SPEAKER_05]: So tell the listeners a little bit about yourself and video games like what you're into.

42
00:02:59,588 --> 00:03:02,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Like what kind of video games do you play without like telling us about your gaming week?

43
00:03:02,491 --> 00:03:05,534
[SPEAKER_05]: What would you say would be like your favorite video game and the types of stuff you're into?

44
00:03:07,696 --> 00:03:10,238
[SPEAKER_12]: Music and rhythm games, RPGs and adventure games.

45
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,891
[SPEAKER_05]: What would you say is your favorite video game ever?

46
00:03:14,874 --> 00:03:15,955
[SPEAKER_12]: Valkyrie Profile.

47
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:16,475
[SPEAKER_12]: Why?

48
00:03:17,056 --> 00:03:21,100
[SPEAKER_12]: The art direction, the story, the multiple endings, and the music.

49
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:24,924
[SPEAKER_05]: How did you get into video games?

50
00:03:24,964 --> 00:03:30,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you get into video games when you were older, or was it something you've had a controller in your hands since you were born, or what?

51
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,914
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I got an Atari 2600 when I was about 6 or 7 years old.

52
00:03:35,294 --> 00:03:41,760
[SPEAKER_12]: And from there I graduated up to the NES and Super NES and played all these Sierra online games and that was it.

53
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:42,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

54
00:03:43,662 --> 00:03:45,764
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course the chat room is chiming in here.

55
00:03:45,824 --> 00:03:48,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Leachum6 in chat says, does that mean plus homo?

56
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:49,047
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess.

57
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:49,487
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

58
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

59
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:52,230
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just, you know what?

60
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:54,712
[SPEAKER_05]: We like video games.

61
00:03:54,732 --> 00:03:55,873
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the important thing here.

62
00:03:55,893 --> 00:03:55,933
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

63
00:03:57,156 --> 00:03:59,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we're going to talk about video games over the next few hours.

64
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:02,881
[SPEAKER_05]: The latest that's going on in video games and news and everything.

65
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:03,862
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what it is.

66
00:04:03,942 --> 00:04:05,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight is just an off night.

67
00:04:05,363 --> 00:04:10,668
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's like the bandwidth or what, but I just feel kind of off and it has nothing to do with Alan being here.

68
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I'm cracking under the pressure.

69
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:12,610
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

70
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it different being here?

71
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:15,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you've listened to the show before, obviously, right?

72
00:04:15,912 --> 00:04:16,933
[SPEAKER_05]: You've commented in chat.

73
00:04:16,993 --> 00:04:19,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it different being here in studio than it is listening?

74
00:04:19,716 --> 00:04:20,176
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.

75
00:04:20,536 --> 00:04:21,117
[SPEAKER_05]: How is it different?

76
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:23,284
[SPEAKER_12]: Dan's in the other room, I'm nervous.

77
00:04:34,392 --> 00:04:35,193
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, don't be nervous.

78
00:04:35,413 --> 00:04:36,174
[SPEAKER_05]: And even Loki.

79
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki seems a little off tonight, too.

80
00:04:37,775 --> 00:04:38,736
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going on, Loki?

81
00:04:38,756 --> 00:04:40,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I asked Loki a question earlier.

82
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:41,198
[SPEAKER_11]: He has malaria.

83
00:04:41,278 --> 00:04:42,639
[SPEAKER_05]: He got a little bitchy with me.

84
00:04:42,739 --> 00:04:45,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it's not... Loki's not usually the bitchy one.

85
00:04:45,622 --> 00:04:47,063
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, she's the bitchy one.

86
00:04:47,103 --> 00:04:48,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki... I didn't get bitchy.

87
00:04:48,524 --> 00:04:49,345
[SPEAKER_05]: I was joking.

88
00:04:49,385 --> 00:04:50,466
[SPEAKER_05]: You were a little bitchy.

89
00:04:50,606 --> 00:04:51,787
[SPEAKER_05]: I was joking.

90
00:04:51,887 --> 00:04:53,769
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

91
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:56,071
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's what I tell Dan once a month.

92
00:04:56,931 --> 00:04:59,514
[SPEAKER_04]: She's like, well, someone didn't give me the stories that I put in there.

93
00:04:59,534 --> 00:05:00,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, well, that's too bad.

94
00:05:02,195 --> 00:05:28,124
[SPEAKER_05]: but here's the thing here's the thing the listeners have to know is that Loki although I know he kind of gets branded as the angry one on the show like you know because he does his little rants when it's appropriate and he's like the angry guy on the show like he's actually like if you meet him in real life he's one of like the nicest people you'll ever meet seriously like I really mean that like Loki goes out of his way to help people you know he's that guy you can call when your computer's broken or you know that tech guy everybody knows that you can call right?

95
00:05:28,204 --> 00:05:28,964
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm the angry one

96
00:05:29,184 --> 00:05:30,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and Jamie's usually the angry one.

97
00:05:31,288 --> 00:05:35,697
[SPEAKER_05]: But tonight is weird because Loki was kind of like, you know...

98
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:37,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know.

99
00:05:38,018 --> 00:05:38,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Too bad.

100
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,761
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Jamie's like, I'm going to knit the listeners a sweater.

101
00:05:44,282 --> 00:05:44,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no.

102
00:05:44,843 --> 00:05:49,846
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just like she wanted to put stories in and I forgot to put them on there.

103
00:05:49,886 --> 00:05:51,887
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, well, I can't do anything about it now.

104
00:05:52,168 --> 00:05:52,848
[SPEAKER_04]: It's no big deal.

105
00:05:52,888 --> 00:05:53,449
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think anyone cares.

106
00:05:53,469 --> 00:05:54,349
[SPEAKER_04]: I was trying to be funny.

107
00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:56,471
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't like, damn you, woman.

108
00:05:56,551 --> 00:05:57,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you complaining?

109
00:05:58,992 --> 00:05:59,933
[SPEAKER_04]: It's never like that.

110
00:05:59,953 --> 00:06:02,054
[SPEAKER_04]: How can I be mad?

111
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:02,775
[SPEAKER_04]: I have chicken.

112
00:06:03,618 --> 00:06:04,678
[SPEAKER_05]: No, how can anybody be mad?

113
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:05,018
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

114
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:06,599
[SPEAKER_11]: And Rob brought churro chips.

115
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:07,699
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

116
00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:09,340
[SPEAKER_05]: These delicious... I'm going to endorse these.

117
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,341
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't pay me, but these chips are delicious.

118
00:06:11,381 --> 00:06:12,941
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I would like another couple of them, please.

119
00:06:12,961 --> 00:06:16,382
[SPEAKER_05]: They're Stacy's Cinnamon Sugar Pita Chips, and they're delicious.

120
00:06:16,562 --> 00:06:18,043
[SPEAKER_05]: And I bought them at Walgreens.

121
00:06:18,063 --> 00:06:18,623
[SPEAKER_11]: No, wait, wait, wait.

122
00:06:18,863 --> 00:06:19,623
[SPEAKER_11]: Get back in here.

123
00:06:19,783 --> 00:06:21,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, is... A Dan approaches?

124
00:06:21,884 --> 00:06:22,824
[SPEAKER_11]: Get your butt back in here.

125
00:06:22,864 --> 00:06:23,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Throw the pester ball at Dan.

126
00:06:24,005 --> 00:06:24,865
[SPEAKER_05]: See if he can catch his attention.

127
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:25,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Pester, pester.

128
00:06:25,905 --> 00:06:27,926
[SPEAKER_11]: Bother, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother.

129
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:28,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan!

130
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan was just trying to say hi to Alan

131
00:06:56,509 --> 00:06:58,657
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's your 50th time listening, I'm sorry.

132
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:01,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

133
00:07:02,476 --> 00:07:05,917
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a lot of Star Trek Online because I have a new graphics card.

134
00:07:06,437 --> 00:07:09,518
[SPEAKER_11]: Or really, I have someone else's old graphics card, but it's new to me.

135
00:07:10,098 --> 00:07:12,238
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, the box of it is sitting right behind you.

136
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:14,079
[SPEAKER_11]: Indeed.

137
00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:25,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, it's the GeForce 9800 GTX Plus Black Edition with bells and whistles and crack, you know, falling out of it.

138
00:07:27,242 --> 00:07:28,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you overclocked it yet?

139
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:28,842
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

140
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:29,723
[SPEAKER_04]: You should.

141
00:07:30,763 --> 00:07:31,083
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

142
00:07:32,045 --> 00:07:34,747
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's easy and it's extra juice.

143
00:07:35,348 --> 00:07:35,708
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

144
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:36,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

145
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,951
[SPEAKER_14]: Why don't you overclock the card, woman?

146
00:07:39,832 --> 00:07:40,873
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't you know what you're doing?

147
00:07:42,174 --> 00:07:44,716
[SPEAKER_11]: Well... I couldn't resist.

148
00:07:44,837 --> 00:07:47,219
[SPEAKER_11]: It went in on Wednesday.

149
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Since then, I've had a friend in the hospital.

150
00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:51,863
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

151
00:07:51,883 --> 00:07:52,684
[SPEAKER_11]: I've had homework.

152
00:07:53,304 --> 00:07:54,125
[SPEAKER_11]: I've had a meeting.

153
00:07:54,145 --> 00:07:54,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Is your friend okay?

154
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:55,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this someone I know?

155
00:07:55,947 --> 00:07:56,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they okay?

156
00:07:56,467 --> 00:07:58,129
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think... No, you've met him.

157
00:07:58,389 --> 00:07:58,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

158
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:05,618
[SPEAKER_11]: One of my friends from Temple, he went in with something with his heart.

159
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:10,821
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll tell you more offline.

160
00:08:11,142 --> 00:08:23,831
[SPEAKER_11]: So I went to see him at the hospital, and I've been trying to play Star Trek Online today, but my internet's been kind of... So every time I would pick a system to go to, it would...

161
00:08:25,032 --> 00:08:33,574
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, you know on Ragnarok Online, when you would have a hiccup, and your character would just suddenly back up like a bajillion miles back from wherever you were before?

162
00:08:34,074 --> 00:08:38,076
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand, but I'll bet you maybe 1% of the listenership understands.

163
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:50,479
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it'd be like, my ship would hiccup, it would backtrack, so you'd actually see the trails going backwards ahead of the ship, and it would change direction, and I'm like, what the hell?

164
00:08:51,212 --> 00:08:55,596
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically your computer was telling you, I can't keep it moving, I don't have the power!

165
00:08:57,177 --> 00:09:03,283
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't even letting, giving me any option to enter the system when I was manually controlling it to go there.

166
00:09:03,964 --> 00:09:08,868
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, well crap, I can't, you know, level, but I started my Klingon the other night and that was pretty cool.

167
00:09:10,239 --> 00:09:10,900
[SPEAKER_11]: I have Klingon now.

168
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,701
[SPEAKER_04]: So the system was down.

169
00:09:13,321 --> 00:09:14,262
[SPEAKER_11]: The system is down.

170
00:09:14,282 --> 00:09:15,463
[SPEAKER_04]: The system is down.

171
00:09:15,603 --> 00:09:16,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

172
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:20,366
[SPEAKER_11]: I was also playing little clone games on my Linux box.

173
00:09:21,087 --> 00:09:24,149
[SPEAKER_11]: I was playing, I think it was called Penguin Freeze or something.

174
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:26,170
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's best to move with penguins.

175
00:09:27,011 --> 00:09:27,931
[SPEAKER_11]: And they had Kinect 4.

176
00:09:28,992 --> 00:09:30,293
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was playing Minesweeper.

177
00:09:30,773 --> 00:09:35,777
[SPEAKER_11]: And the little, you know... A socially awkward penguin in the game?

178
00:09:36,317 --> 00:09:36,738
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess.

179
00:09:36,758 --> 00:09:36,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

180
00:09:38,219 --> 00:09:51,421
[SPEAKER_11]: and then um I was playing Puzzle Bobble in Flash which is pretty fun and um that's about it yeah alright and I slept

181
00:09:52,628 --> 00:09:54,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Techmaster Loki, how was your gaming week?

182
00:09:54,550 --> 00:10:01,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, before I get to that, I should say some of the people in chat are commenting on the exchange earlier about the switching personalities night.

183
00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:04,701
[SPEAKER_05]: SJ100Matt, go USA in chat.

184
00:10:04,961 --> 00:10:06,123
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, it's Olympics time.

185
00:10:06,904 --> 00:10:10,367
[SPEAKER_05]: SJ100Matt says, Loki missed posting stories, but at least he has chicken.

186
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:12,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki Jenkins.

187
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:19,063
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted honey barbecue chicken every now and then to get the craving for.

188
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:19,924
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing wrong with chicken.

189
00:10:20,725 --> 00:10:23,869
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I kind of have a cold right now, so it was the only thing that sounded good.

190
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:27,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Chicken and vitamin C. Orange chicken.

191
00:10:28,074 --> 00:10:28,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

192
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:29,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange chicken, yeah.

193
00:10:29,756 --> 00:10:30,517
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

194
00:10:32,783 --> 00:10:35,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, let's see, this week, didn't play a whole lot of stuff.

195
00:10:35,964 --> 00:10:40,505
[SPEAKER_04]: I did put in a good five hours worth of Borderlands, so yesterday, so that was fun.

196
00:10:41,285 --> 00:10:48,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, started doing, uh, Mad Moxie's Underdome Riot, and it's very tedious.

197
00:10:48,487 --> 00:10:57,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, I did play one round with a friend, um, earlier in the week during lunch, and it was actually pretty fun co-op, but single player, man, it's pretty boring.

198
00:10:58,149 --> 00:10:58,589
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um...

199
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:05,593
[SPEAKER_04]: It was cool, so I played that a little bit, and I'm just kind of working through Borderlands still.

200
00:11:05,633 --> 00:11:09,476
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still very fun, and I can't wait for the next expansion to come out.

201
00:11:09,496 --> 00:11:10,137
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be pretty cool.

202
00:11:10,397 --> 00:11:12,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, what a weird level cap, though.

203
00:11:12,658 --> 00:11:15,420
[SPEAKER_04]: They capped it at 61 in the new expansion.

204
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:16,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

205
00:11:17,242 --> 00:11:18,823
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, okay...

206
00:11:20,376 --> 00:11:22,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe there's going to be four more expansions.

207
00:11:22,158 --> 00:11:23,479
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'll be 62 and then 63.

208
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:28,604
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still dumb, but 61, okay, that's what you want to stop at.

209
00:11:28,684 --> 00:11:30,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine with me.

210
00:11:31,086 --> 00:11:33,528
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, more Grand Theft Auto.

211
00:11:34,008 --> 00:11:40,134
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, actually, I want to say that I'm in the top 200 now for cumulative...

212
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:58,726
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not really sure about that, but I know for a fact, though, I'm in like the mid-70s now for true skill rankings, so I'm in the top 75 players in the world.

213
00:11:59,206 --> 00:11:59,967
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty awesome.

214
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:04,429
[SPEAKER_05]: And if one of our listeners wants to serve you a slice of humble pie, how can they do that?

215
00:12:05,151 --> 00:12:05,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Find me online.

216
00:12:06,091 --> 00:12:07,592
[SPEAKER_04]: We play just ranked games now.

217
00:12:07,672 --> 00:12:22,619
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you happen to be playing a ranked game around 10, 10.30-ish, 3, 3.30, and then sometime between noon and 1, depending if we're playing during lunch, you should be able to find us because there's no one on there.

218
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,580
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's pretty easy.

219
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,022
[SPEAKER_04]: We have four systems, and we're able to get into ranked games together easy.

220
00:12:29,762 --> 00:12:29,982
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

221
00:12:31,363 --> 00:12:32,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

222
00:12:46,863 --> 00:12:47,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

223
00:12:47,964 --> 00:12:48,545
[SPEAKER_14]: QQ more.

224
00:12:50,106 --> 00:12:50,727
[SPEAKER_04]: They make fun of me.

225
00:12:50,747 --> 00:12:51,367
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, what?

226
00:12:52,028 --> 00:12:57,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, they'll get ahead or something and they'll be just like, oh, you're just sucking it up today, blah, blah, blah.

227
00:12:57,092 --> 00:12:59,695
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, alright, now I gotta kill you.

228
00:13:01,136 --> 00:13:02,157
[SPEAKER_04]: See how they go and do that.

229
00:13:02,617 --> 00:13:09,063
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you're just gonna learn the lesson that's involved with, you know, criticizing my plane.

230
00:13:09,884 --> 00:13:10,244
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is...

231
00:13:11,445 --> 00:13:11,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Death.

232
00:13:12,065 --> 00:13:13,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots and lots of death.

233
00:13:14,507 --> 00:13:15,948
[SPEAKER_04]: In very humiliating ways.

234
00:13:17,849 --> 00:13:18,109
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.

235
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:19,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

236
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,731
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week, not a whole lot to report on.

237
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:23,892
[SPEAKER_05]: I moved this week though.

238
00:13:23,912 --> 00:13:24,953
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a really good excuse.

239
00:13:25,033 --> 00:13:28,315
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a new place that I'm living at and I'm still without internet.

240
00:13:28,335 --> 00:13:30,776
[SPEAKER_05]: So not even a lot of WoW this weekend.

241
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:31,456
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of sad.

242
00:13:32,217 --> 00:13:35,218
[SPEAKER_05]: But I did play a little bit of WoW of course earlier in the week.

243
00:13:35,238 --> 00:13:35,839
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, come on.

244
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:36,779
[SPEAKER_05]: It's me we're talking about.

245
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,441
[SPEAKER_05]: I was playing that right up until they unplugged the internet.

246
00:13:40,021 --> 00:14:00,375
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after that, probably my other big gaming thing was that I actually went to Roseville Golf Land this week The great place where video games go to die Although I have to say, the games I was interested in playing were all working fine And I did play lots and lots of Beatmania Distorted And I was playing the old school songs in Distorted But I know Alan tried playing King of Fighters What was wrong?

247
00:14:00,516 --> 00:14:03,237
[SPEAKER_05]: You were playing King of Fighters 98 or something?

248
00:14:03,258 --> 00:14:03,958
[SPEAKER_05]: What were you playing there?

249
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:05,339
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it was King of Fighters 2003 Okay

250
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:16,626
[SPEAKER_12]: and the first player side had a button missing and the second player side couldn't move left or forward when you're second player so that was a great time.

251
00:14:18,988 --> 00:14:20,649
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so easy to fix too though.

252
00:14:20,789 --> 00:14:23,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Imagine trying to play a fighting game without moving forward.

253
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,011
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what this means?

254
00:14:24,611 --> 00:14:25,492
[SPEAKER_11]: Photo time again.

255
00:14:26,292 --> 00:14:29,694
[SPEAKER_05]: But I gotta say, the 2DX machine worked fine.

256
00:14:29,955 --> 00:14:32,556
[SPEAKER_05]: And all the music games actually seemed to be in really good shape.

257
00:14:32,817 --> 00:14:35,418
[SPEAKER_04]: You were playing DJ Max Technica.

258
00:14:35,438 --> 00:14:36,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was working fine, right?

259
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:38,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me give you an example of how long it's been since I've been there.

260
00:14:39,301 --> 00:14:43,244
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't have the 2DX machine set up the last time I was there.

261
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:45,729
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

262
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:47,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a lot's changed, I gotta be honest.

263
00:14:48,051 --> 00:14:52,535
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, you know, a lot of Ticket Redemption machines still, and this is really true of any arcade I could probably mention.

264
00:14:52,595 --> 00:14:54,336
[SPEAKER_05]: It's mostly Ticket Redemption machines.

265
00:14:54,356 --> 00:14:55,017
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a safe bet.

266
00:14:55,457 --> 00:14:55,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

267
00:14:55,858 --> 00:15:02,103
[SPEAKER_05]: I did play a little bit, Alan and I sparred on Mario Kart, and, you know, it's nothing like Mario Kart, the home version.

268
00:15:03,084 --> 00:15:04,866
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I've been wanting to play the second one.

269
00:15:05,366 --> 00:15:33,961
[SPEAKER_05]: because they have a second GPRK but yeah the GPRK ones are kind of boring actually but hey port them in the home systems make them playable online oh wait asking too much alright so that was pretty much my gaming week not a lot of exciting stuff because you know without me moving right now hopefully I'll have more next week I know I will in two weeks when Final Fantasy XIII is out so just wait Alan how was your it's only two weeks away I know it's exciting it is exciting it's so exciting alright Alan how was your gaming week what did you play

270
00:15:34,481 --> 00:15:39,144
[SPEAKER_12]: I played a lot of WoW because for some reason someone got me into that.

271
00:15:39,184 --> 00:15:39,805
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know who.

272
00:15:40,945 --> 00:15:42,747
[SPEAKER_12]: So lots of WoW.

273
00:15:42,887 --> 00:15:45,248
[SPEAKER_12]: Logged into my City of Heroes characters.

274
00:15:45,669 --> 00:15:46,509
[SPEAKER_12]: I still play that.

275
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:51,192
[SPEAKER_12]: The next expansion, Going Rogue, is actually due out in July.

276
00:15:52,913 --> 00:15:56,696
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just logged in to get re-familiarized myself with my characters.

277
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:03,080
[SPEAKER_12]: Played some Gyromancer, the DLC, the extra hard maps.

278
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:03,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that it works.

279
00:16:04,361 --> 00:16:05,182
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, now that it works.

280
00:16:06,923 --> 00:16:09,725
[SPEAKER_12]: And Valkyrie Profile DS is really what I'm playing right now.

281
00:16:10,746 --> 00:16:11,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

282
00:16:12,707 --> 00:16:15,870
[SPEAKER_05]: City of Heroes real quick, because it's not a game we've talked a lot about on the show.

283
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,951
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we've all kind of like dabbled in it a little bit.

284
00:16:17,971 --> 00:16:20,673
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got the Architect Edition in my closet.

285
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:24,657
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you kind of played it like a little bit, but not like extensively, right?

286
00:16:25,177 --> 00:16:26,858
[SPEAKER_05]: What does City of Heroes have?

287
00:16:26,878 --> 00:16:29,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you're obviously still playing it while you're juggling WoW.

288
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,043
[SPEAKER_05]: What does City of Heroes have for you in an MMO that WoW is lacking?

289
00:16:34,565 --> 00:16:44,235
[SPEAKER_12]: The ability to come up with a very strong character concept and the costume designer is so powerful that you can pretty much have a completely unique character.

290
00:16:44,255 --> 00:16:45,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I love that.

291
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:51,602
[SPEAKER_11]: I downloaded that little Korean client that you could just play with all day and not have to even have an account.

292
00:16:51,942 --> 00:16:52,583
[SPEAKER_11]: That was so much fun.

293
00:16:53,744 --> 00:17:14,353
[SPEAKER_05]: and I did notice that when you were showing me your thing like how you could like go in a phone booth and you'd have like the different costumes you could save like five different costume presets it didn't seem to affect your abilities at all whatsoever at least that I noticed I don't know maybe it did and then like you had a little bio written on your character and you'd actually kind of written a whole little thing and I was thinking this is like an RP type of player's

294
00:17:14,913 --> 00:17:20,617
[SPEAKER_12]: City of Heroes has an amazing RP community, and I think it's almost a six-year-old game.

295
00:17:21,077 --> 00:17:29,323
[SPEAKER_12]: And for them to be releasing a major expansion six years after the fact, there has to be the money there and the subscriptions, and it's mostly the RPers that are sticking around.

296
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:32,925
[SPEAKER_12]: And WoW's probably been around about five, six years.

297
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:35,847
[SPEAKER_05]: It just had its fifth anniversary, so it's been around about as long.

298
00:17:36,568 --> 00:17:42,652
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, City of Heroes was huge for the first six or seven months, and then when WoW came out, there was sort of a big vacuum.

299
00:17:45,434 --> 00:17:46,955
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

300
00:18:02,552 --> 00:18:22,854
[SPEAKER_05]: but there's definitely you know there's always going to be those diehards that just love the game and I think especially when you bring that RP component into it you know I don't know I mean Final Fantasy XI had somewhat you could do I mean you could do the RP with any game but I could see where City of Heroes really lets you embrace that you know Final Fantasy XI if you think WoW is limited with how your character can look Final Fantasy XI is really limiting too so

301
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:31,498
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I have to say that, you know, the moment I moved on to Star Trek Online, I forgot about World of Warcraft.

302
00:18:31,758 --> 00:18:32,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Really, I did.

303
00:18:32,338 --> 00:18:35,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, then let me ask you the same question I asked Alan.

304
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,621
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it about Star Trek Online that had it for you that WoW didn't?

305
00:18:38,781 --> 00:18:41,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is it just, I know you love Star Trek, is it just the fandom, period?

306
00:18:41,983 --> 00:18:47,930
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really not just the fandom, it's the fact that I really can play by myself.

307
00:18:48,051 --> 00:18:52,196
[SPEAKER_11]: It's annoying as fuck to party with people.

308
00:18:52,456 --> 00:18:53,417
[SPEAKER_11]: Really, it's annoying.

309
00:18:53,537 --> 00:18:54,479
[SPEAKER_11]: It pisses me off.

310
00:18:54,579 --> 00:18:55,240
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate doing it.

311
00:18:56,745 --> 00:19:01,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Even when it's one of my friends, after an hour of following behind somebody, I'm like, okay, I'm tired of this.

312
00:19:01,268 --> 00:19:02,068
[SPEAKER_11]: This is monotonous.

313
00:19:02,729 --> 00:19:13,615
[SPEAKER_11]: Whereas in Star Trek Online, it's like when you are doing your instances, you go into an area and you may have three people already there, complete strangers, and you can run through your series of instances together.

314
00:19:13,935 --> 00:19:15,176
[SPEAKER_11]: When you're done with it, that's it.

315
00:19:15,956 --> 00:19:17,277
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have to really hang out with them.

316
00:19:17,517 --> 00:19:19,018
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have to follow them around.

317
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:20,179
[SPEAKER_11]: You can do your own thing.

318
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:30,605
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I had one person go into one instance, and I went to a completely different one, and we all got, you know, the points for it, because we, it was still, we were working together.

319
00:19:31,526 --> 00:19:41,532
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what I like, is it's sort of, it's teamwork, but you can choose if you want to do a fleet mission or, and it's, and it feels like an episode.

320
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:45,435
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got enough random in it that it really keeps my interest in it.

321
00:19:45,945 --> 00:19:46,245
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate PvP.

322
00:20:06,808 --> 00:20:15,132
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but I gotta admit, from a WoW standpoint, you know, I realize not everybody's into it, which is cool, but for me, why I like WoW is that it is such a robust game.

323
00:20:15,492 --> 00:20:25,756
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I can just log in, it's like, oh, I'm gonna just go slip right into a dungeon, or, you know, nobody else is online, maybe I'll go PvP by myself, or, hey, Alan's online, we're gonna go quest together, and it's like we're hanging out, but we're not, because we're nerds.

324
00:20:26,176 --> 00:20:30,098
[SPEAKER_11]: I totally don't mind doing PvP if I get to smash some Klingons in the face.

325
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:35,661
[SPEAKER_11]: I just can't wait until we get the Romulan and Cardassian missions.

326
00:20:35,741 --> 00:20:37,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that like a future expansion?

327
00:20:37,101 --> 00:20:38,782
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think that's going to be a future thing.

328
00:20:39,562 --> 00:20:47,666
[SPEAKER_05]: I will play some more Star Trek online, but see, there's this big thing kind of hovering in the distance, and that is Final Fantasy XIV.

329
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:51,631
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just know, like, I have to play it.

330
00:20:52,012 --> 00:20:52,512
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to.

331
00:20:52,873 --> 00:20:54,375
[SPEAKER_05]: I sucked three years.

332
00:20:54,436 --> 00:20:57,500
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you guys think I talk about WoW a lot, you should have been on the show.

333
00:20:59,334 --> 00:21:00,475
[SPEAKER_05]: 3, 4 years ago.

334
00:21:00,595 --> 00:21:03,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, do you remember when we used to talk about the fairy server?

335
00:21:03,756 --> 00:21:05,137
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's old school, okay?

336
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,037
[SPEAKER_11]: I used to play with you.

337
00:21:06,157 --> 00:21:06,857
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, we used to talk.

338
00:21:07,037 --> 00:21:10,259
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I used to just talk about Final Fantasy XI all the freaking time on this show.

339
00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:14,140
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, I have to try XIV just because I sunk so much time into XI.

340
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,861
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know, I gave XI a really good try.

341
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:20,483
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you were here watching me play, doing the freaking macros on my controller.

342
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:23,224
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you hate grouping with people, XI stinks.

343
00:21:23,404 --> 00:21:23,884
[SPEAKER_05]: It does.

344
00:21:23,964 --> 00:21:25,685
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, XI is about forced...

345
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:27,259
[SPEAKER_11]: and me.

346
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:33,047
[SPEAKER_05]: To be fair, they fixed a lot of that years later after I left with the level sync and everything.

347
00:21:35,391 --> 00:21:39,697
[SPEAKER_11]: My big problem with that one is just that maybe it was because I was playing the White Mage.

348
00:21:39,717 --> 00:21:41,320
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it was because I was the party bitch.

349
00:21:42,441 --> 00:21:42,781
[SPEAKER_11]: You know?

350
00:21:43,942 --> 00:21:45,243
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've told this story before.

351
00:21:46,984 --> 00:21:52,448
[SPEAKER_11]: The final straw for that game was me calling everybody over with my little dinky... Okay, I will go back.

352
00:21:52,528 --> 00:21:54,629
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, playing with Japanese players is not annoying.

353
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,250
[SPEAKER_11]: They know how to party.

354
00:21:57,371 --> 00:21:57,951
[SPEAKER_04]: If you know what I mean.

355
00:21:58,092 --> 00:21:59,813
[SPEAKER_04]: They're the only ones that would respect a bard.

356
00:22:00,873 --> 00:22:02,094
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

357
00:22:02,134 --> 00:22:03,335
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember when you tried to play a bard.

358
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:07,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I was a pimp-ass bard, but, you know... No one wanted to play the bard.

359
00:22:08,498 --> 00:22:09,479
[SPEAKER_04]: I rocked the bard.

360
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:10,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Audience, if you would...

361
00:22:13,521 --> 00:22:14,842
[SPEAKER_05]: See, here's your proof.

362
00:22:15,442 --> 00:22:16,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Angry Loki.

363
00:22:16,542 --> 00:22:20,543
[SPEAKER_05]: When you talk about, you know, some of the hacking and the stuff, he gets angry Loki.

364
00:22:21,223 --> 00:22:22,463
[SPEAKER_05]: I rocked the bard.

365
00:22:22,483 --> 00:22:26,344
[SPEAKER_05]: What angry man says that?

366
00:22:26,504 --> 00:22:30,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, you can also swap out the music and stuff in there because there was that little trick you could do.

367
00:22:31,425 --> 00:22:35,246
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I would have, like, smack my bitch up to, like, the battle music.

368
00:22:35,486 --> 00:22:36,426
[SPEAKER_04]: It was awesome.

369
00:22:37,286 --> 00:22:41,107
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember when you would mount up on the chocobo and it would play the theme from The NeverEnding Story.

370
00:22:46,642 --> 00:22:47,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.

371
00:22:47,603 --> 00:22:48,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's fun.

372
00:22:48,843 --> 00:22:51,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, what my story was, as I was saying.

373
00:22:51,784 --> 00:22:52,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

374
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:52,625
[SPEAKER_11]: It's okay.

375
00:22:52,725 --> 00:22:53,565
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I think that's funny.

376
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:54,165
[SPEAKER_11]: It was worth it.

377
00:22:54,185 --> 00:22:55,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Smack my bitch up.

378
00:22:55,846 --> 00:23:03,429
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, so my little character, you know, because when you throw out your macros, you can call everyone in your party to come back to you so that you can do an area effect buff.

379
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:09,832
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was finally like, I did the buff, everything, then this one comes in, hey, I'm in a buff.

380
00:23:10,132 --> 00:23:12,013
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, fuck you.

381
00:23:12,353 --> 00:23:12,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Log out.

382
00:23:13,734 --> 00:23:14,614
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was it.

383
00:23:14,714 --> 00:23:15,655
[SPEAKER_11]: I never played again.

384
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:23,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally forgot about Falkor's Ride or whatever it said to the Chocobo thing.

385
00:23:23,515 --> 00:23:24,457
[SPEAKER_04]: It was awesome.

386
00:23:25,018 --> 00:23:26,000
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very epic.

387
00:23:26,952 --> 00:23:31,797
[SPEAKER_05]: This was when Loki and I lived together, and, like, we had our computers, like, kind of, like, right next to each other, like, they're here in the studio.

388
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:38,143
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I'd be doing my thing in Final Fantasy XI, and then, like, I'm like, okay, because, you know, Loki and I would play together sometimes because we're nerds, right?

389
00:23:38,423 --> 00:23:41,486
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd say, like, okay, Loki, come meet me in Alteppa Desert and let's party.

390
00:23:44,249 --> 00:23:47,251
[SPEAKER_04]: And, like, Loki's fanfare is, like, coming from the computer.

391
00:23:49,953 --> 00:23:50,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Bring your harp!

392
00:23:53,235 --> 00:24:09,288
[SPEAKER_11]: I did that though with Ragnarok for a little while because it's all mp3s so you could change out the music so I remember going into it was this one place that used to have this big epic music and it was like instead it was a bassoon quartet

393
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:10,821
[SPEAKER_04]: There was another one.

394
00:24:10,841 --> 00:24:13,984
[SPEAKER_04]: The group party music that I had was the battle music.

395
00:24:14,324 --> 00:24:19,188
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't the theme of Zanarkand or whatever, but from Final Fantasy XI.

396
00:24:19,308 --> 00:24:21,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it was the jacked, angry music.

397
00:24:21,971 --> 00:24:22,491
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that.

398
00:24:22,852 --> 00:24:23,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherworld.

399
00:24:24,573 --> 00:24:26,615
[SPEAKER_05]: It was awesome.

400
00:24:26,735 --> 00:24:31,099
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember that from Final Fantasy X. I remember it from your freaking every time.

401
00:24:31,419 --> 00:24:34,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I was a healer, so I never really engaged the monster.

402
00:24:34,602 --> 00:25:00,697
[SPEAKER_05]: but like, you know, when you, I think you finally started Black Mage instead of Bard, and you know, we'd be fighting, you know, the killer level 60 rabbit, or whatever and then like, okay engage the rabbit, doo doo doo doo doo, like you just had the most epic bunny killing music I'd ever heard in my life I just hope that's the only thing that they include from Final Fantasy XI in XIV is the ability to change the music you're not supposed to be able to do that, you just like to hack things, yes alright

403
00:25:02,518 --> 00:25:05,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, boy, we're not even into the gaming news yet.

404
00:25:05,661 --> 00:25:06,021
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

405
00:25:06,302 --> 00:25:08,504
[SPEAKER_11]: If I was going to do that, then my battle music would be bitches.

406
00:25:10,706 --> 00:25:11,606
[SPEAKER_11]: Mindless self-indulgence.

407
00:25:13,388 --> 00:25:14,289
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what mine would be.

408
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,831
[SPEAKER_05]: What would be some good battle music for me, Alan?

409
00:25:16,931 --> 00:25:19,614
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to think for Final Fantasy XIV if I could hack the music.

410
00:25:19,634 --> 00:25:20,795
[SPEAKER_11]: What are you guys talking about?

411
00:25:25,728 --> 00:25:43,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow Actually Shaoran in the chat room I hope I pronounced that right Chat.orangewatchradio.com has a suggestion If Star Trek Online had a customizable music OLR would need to bring in I'm on a boat I would totally do that for the You know how they have the ferries you can take

412
00:25:46,842 --> 00:25:50,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, I remember the first time taking a ferry in Final Fantasy XI.

413
00:25:50,606 --> 00:25:54,450
[SPEAKER_05]: I got on the little ferry because getting around in Final Fantasy XI kind of sucks.

414
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,992
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes like 30 minutes to get from one thing to the other.

415
00:25:57,332 --> 00:25:58,173
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'd get on the boat.

416
00:25:58,213 --> 00:25:59,915
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember the first time I ever took a boat ride.

417
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:02,657
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

418
00:26:02,697 --> 00:26:04,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy little boat music and then all of a sudden it gets really dark.

419
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Do-do-do-do-do-do.

420
00:26:06,721 --> 00:26:08,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we freaking got raided by pirates.

421
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:10,542
[SPEAKER_05]: The first time I ever rode a boat in the game.

422
00:26:10,842 --> 00:26:14,223
[SPEAKER_05]: But I remember that being an epic moment of Final Fantasy XI.

423
00:26:14,263 --> 00:26:17,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, that was actually really cool that the boats will randomly get raided by pirates.

424
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:22,644
[SPEAKER_05]: You would have to, as a low-level character, literally run and hide in the basement.

425
00:26:23,024 --> 00:26:23,985
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I had to.

426
00:26:24,005 --> 00:26:26,805
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you came and got me one time.

427
00:26:26,865 --> 00:26:28,886
[SPEAKER_04]: While someone drags a kraken down the stairs.

428
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:31,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

429
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:38,297
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to say, though, I still, to this day, remember the look on your face when I was doing my macros on my controller.

430
00:26:38,737 --> 00:26:41,958
[SPEAKER_05]: I was very impressed with the way you were doing the... And then I couldn't.

431
00:26:41,978 --> 00:26:43,318
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I hated in World of Warcraft.

432
00:26:43,338 --> 00:26:44,539
[SPEAKER_11]: I couldn't use my damn controller.

433
00:26:44,639 --> 00:26:46,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy XI was built for the PS2.

434
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:50,740
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have to remember, using a controller, that's the way most of the Japanese players do it.

435
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,880
[SPEAKER_05]: And some American ones as well, obviously.

436
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,381
[SPEAKER_05]: But I cannot imagine that game without a computer keyboard.

437
00:26:55,821 --> 00:26:56,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

438
00:26:56,921 --> 00:26:57,722
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with Ranma.

439
00:26:57,762 --> 00:26:59,223
[SPEAKER_05]: When did this become Final Fantasy Radio?

440
00:26:59,283 --> 00:26:59,643
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

441
00:26:59,683 --> 00:27:00,303
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's move on.

442
00:27:00,343 --> 00:27:08,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into some housekeeping tonight and talk a little bit about what's going on with OLR before we get into the gaming news tonight.

443
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,952
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have a whole lot of show-specific news besides...

444
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:27,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't forget that you can always join us on our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, and of course we're on Facebook as well, Orange Lounge Radio there, add us as your friend, and we will usually make updates, except tonight, because with all the internet hiccup we had earlier, we didn't get onto many of the social networking, but...

445
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:36,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, we got a voicemail from Breslul, and he wants to update you guys on USL Madness and what is going on there in our forums.

446
00:27:36,511 --> 00:27:41,892
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to go to the voicemail, and uh-oh, did I delete it?

447
00:27:41,972 --> 00:27:42,473
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope not.

448
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:46,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops, when we did the reboot earlier, I might have deleted his voicemail.

449
00:27:46,954 --> 00:27:48,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoopsie, let's see if I can get to it here.

450
00:27:50,074 --> 00:27:51,275
[SPEAKER_05]: And here we go, here's his voicemail.

451
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:56,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a voicemail from Breslul about what is going on in USL Madness at our forums at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

452
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:08,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello Orange Lounge Radio, it's Brest Law once again reminding you, three hosts, and the listeners to give us some votes here on USL Madness.

453
00:28:08,164 --> 00:28:10,305
[SPEAKER_09]: We have some fantastic matchups in the round of 32.

454
00:28:11,325 --> 00:28:14,507
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got a heated one between Final Fantasy 7 and Pokemon.

455
00:28:14,887 --> 00:28:18,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Mega Man 2 is facing Mega Man 3 in one of the most bizarre matchups of the tournament.

456
00:28:19,429 --> 00:28:23,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Ocarina of Time vs. Tecmo Super Bowl, Earthbound vs. Secret of Mana.

457
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:25,511
[SPEAKER_09]: I could go on, but there's not enough time in the show.

458
00:28:25,987 --> 00:28:36,536
[SPEAKER_09]: but please visit our forums, get yourself an account and vote today because half of these games go away and then next week is the Sweet 16 where things get incredibly interesting.

459
00:28:37,337 --> 00:28:40,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Once again, log on to our forums and vote.

460
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:45,524
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll talk to you later and USL will be back on the... This is it.

461
00:28:46,185 --> 00:28:46,946
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me try that again.

462
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:51,630
[SPEAKER_09]: USL will be back on February 27th.

463
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,390
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see you then.

464
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:52,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Till then!

465
00:28:54,096 --> 00:29:02,780
[SPEAKER_05]: That was Bress Lowell from Under Sedation Live, Saturday nights at AllGamesRadio, AllGamesRadio.com, or if you want just the radio feed, it's AllGamesRadio.com.

466
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,881
[SPEAKER_05]: And they'll be back on Saturday.

467
00:29:04,941 --> 00:29:14,305
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, Bress Lowell and Travis, they team up with us to do this USL Madness, which is kind of like a take on March Madness, if you don't know what it is, where they try to define the greatest video game of all time.

468
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:18,327
[SPEAKER_05]: And everybody submits their lists, and then he seeds it like it was basketball games and

469
00:29:18,667 --> 00:29:19,527
[SPEAKER_11]: And Guardian Legend wins.

470
00:29:20,448 --> 00:29:23,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Guardian Legend wasn't even in the top 64 on people's list.

471
00:29:23,568 --> 00:29:24,329
[SPEAKER_05]: It was on my list.

472
00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:27,009
[SPEAKER_05]: I had it in my top 25 games of all time, but I guess that wasn't enough.

473
00:29:27,389 --> 00:29:28,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, admittedly, it wasn't number one.

474
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:29,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Jamie.

475
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,871
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah, as he said in the voicemail, there's some pretty epic matchups going on right now.

476
00:29:33,891 --> 00:29:35,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Mega Man 2 versus Mega Man 3.

477
00:29:35,491 --> 00:29:37,392
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you even decide between those two games?

478
00:29:37,432 --> 00:29:38,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Mega Man 2.

479
00:29:38,412 --> 00:29:39,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Practically the same guy.

480
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:39,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Mega Man 2.

481
00:29:39,853 --> 00:29:40,733
[SPEAKER_05]: I said 2 as well.

482
00:29:40,793 --> 00:29:42,553
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it that draws you to 2 over 3, though?

483
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,294
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the number 2 better than the 3.

484
00:29:47,603 --> 00:30:16,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Bubble Man Stage Music Metal Blades I think it's just the fact that well for me and the way I rationalized it when I voted on the forums was that Mega Man 2 was kind of set the bar like obviously Mega Man 1 was the original but you know it had all these things like scoring and less bosses and kind of a different interface and everything Mega Man 2 kind of really polished that and really Mega Man 3 is just Mega Man 2 with some new frills in it but Mega Man 2 was so important that those bosses came back in 3

485
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:23,622
[SPEAKER_11]: Mega Man 2 was one of my big accomplishments because I used to be able to do the dragon level blindfolded.

486
00:30:23,742 --> 00:30:25,343
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember you telling me about that.

487
00:30:25,363 --> 00:30:29,365
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to be able to play that game through in one sitting.

488
00:30:29,445 --> 00:30:30,805
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all about timing with that level.

489
00:30:31,105 --> 00:30:34,667
[SPEAKER_11]: The only other game I've been able to do that with is World 8-1 and Super Mario Bros.

490
00:30:35,407 --> 00:30:36,708
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

491
00:30:54,145 --> 00:31:04,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy 7 is, it seems like a lot of the vote isn't, I mean, I could be wrong, but there's a lot of vote that is not for Pokemon so much as it is against Final Fantasy 7 because of all the fanboy wank.

492
00:31:04,735 --> 00:31:06,476
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was trying to figure out, like, why that is.

493
00:31:06,556 --> 00:31:13,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, like, I don't think Final Fantasy 7 is the best Final Fantasy, but certainly, like, it was the game that got me to buy a PlayStation.

494
00:31:14,503 --> 00:31:16,986
[SPEAKER_11]: It was, you know... I owned that game before I had a PlayStation.

495
00:31:18,026 --> 00:31:18,647
[SPEAKER_05]: How does that work?

496
00:31:18,847 --> 00:31:19,507
[SPEAKER_11]: My roommate had one.

497
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:19,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

498
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:28,433
[SPEAKER_05]: And, yeah, you know, I just remember it just changed the way you kind of perceive Final Fantasy games because it was so different from the sprite-based ones.

499
00:31:28,893 --> 00:31:34,537
[SPEAKER_05]: But I agree the fan wank got a little crazy, but I can't hold that against the game.

500
00:31:35,057 --> 00:31:35,497
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know.

501
00:31:35,517 --> 00:31:39,159
[SPEAKER_05]: But then you look at a series like Pokemon, and that's like a cult.

502
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,441
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like, I don't even know.

503
00:31:42,502 --> 00:31:44,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, Pokemon sucks people in and doesn't let them go.

504
00:31:44,723 --> 00:31:46,244
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, I don't get it.

505
00:31:46,664 --> 00:31:47,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know.

506
00:31:47,725 --> 00:31:49,026
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, whatever.

507
00:31:49,646 --> 00:31:50,747
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't be mad, I guess.

508
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:51,408
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what happens.

509
00:31:51,608 --> 00:31:54,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Every gamer has a voice, even when that voice is whack.

510
00:31:54,851 --> 00:31:59,474
[SPEAKER_05]: www.orangeloungeradio.com No disrespect to the Pokemon fans.

511
00:32:01,776 --> 00:32:03,998
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, they're kind of all the same game.

512
00:32:04,258 --> 00:32:05,779
[SPEAKER_04]: They are all the same game.

513
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:06,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Look!

514
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:12,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, we discovered new Pokemon that are no way similar to the other Pokemon.

515
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:12,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Buy more games.

516
00:32:13,566 --> 00:32:15,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Before you send in the hate mail, though...

517
00:32:15,707 --> 00:32:17,329
[SPEAKER_05]: I was there when the first movie came out in theaters.

518
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:18,489
[SPEAKER_05]: I went and saw it opening night, okay?

519
00:32:18,509 --> 00:32:20,371
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I went with you, didn't I?

520
00:32:21,192 --> 00:32:22,072
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I went in Chico.

521
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:24,454
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's right, because I got the import.

522
00:32:24,654 --> 00:32:27,677
[SPEAKER_05]: You might have went to the second one with me, because I went and saw the second one, too.

523
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,118
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw the third one with you at the theater.

524
00:32:29,538 --> 00:32:29,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably.

525
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:34,362
[SPEAKER_11]: But I had to import a copy of the Japanese one.

526
00:32:36,063 --> 00:32:37,445
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, don't send in the hate mail.

527
00:32:37,845 --> 00:32:38,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Pokemon's fine.

528
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:38,886
[SPEAKER_05]: I just...

529
00:32:40,673 --> 00:32:41,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are they going to go with it?

530
00:32:41,774 --> 00:32:45,816
[SPEAKER_05]: They just make more Pokemon.

531
00:32:45,856 --> 00:32:47,457
[SPEAKER_05]: If they made an MMO, I'd try it.

532
00:32:47,637 --> 00:32:47,877
[SPEAKER_05]: I would.

533
00:32:47,937 --> 00:32:50,578
[SPEAKER_11]: For the record, I still think Digimon's cooler.

534
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:52,799
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's get into some gaming news.

535
00:32:52,819 --> 00:32:55,320
[SPEAKER_05]: We're like, what, 30 minutes in the show after a 15-minute late start.

536
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,421
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't even covered news yet.

537
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:59,763
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be a 10 o'clock at night show.

538
00:32:59,903 --> 00:33:01,003
[SPEAKER_05]: That's 1 a.m.

539
00:33:01,043 --> 00:33:01,824
[SPEAKER_05]: for you East Coasters.

540
00:33:01,864 --> 00:33:03,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get started on some gaming news, Loki.

541
00:33:04,745 --> 00:33:07,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so the ESA did a survey.

542
00:33:08,707 --> 00:33:14,529
[SPEAKER_04]: I shouldn't really say a survey, but they did research focusing on 200 specific titles during the month of December.

543
00:33:14,709 --> 00:33:17,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Not necessarily stuff that came out in December, but just during that month.

544
00:33:18,211 --> 00:33:30,576
[SPEAKER_04]: And it showed that of those 200 titles, there were 9.78 million illegal downloads for those titles during the month of December.

545
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:34,258
[SPEAKER_04]: And you might think, okay, well, maybe the U.S.

546
00:33:34,358 --> 00:33:38,041
[SPEAKER_04]: is to blame because there's a lot of people in the U.S.

547
00:33:38,061 --> 00:33:38,461
[SPEAKER_04]: that pirate.

548
00:33:38,881 --> 00:33:42,804
[SPEAKER_04]: But actually, no, there's other countries that were a lot higher.

549
00:33:43,244 --> 00:33:54,492
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, the highest number of unauthorized downloads came from Italy with 20.3% of the total, Spain following that with 12.5%, France with 7.5%, and China with 5.7%.

550
00:34:01,437 --> 00:34:01,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I blame Luxembourg

551
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:19,621
[SPEAKER_05]: The countries I think of are not the ones you're naming.

552
00:34:19,681 --> 00:34:34,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I usually think, you know, because of the stereotypes about being able to buy bootlegs in Hong Kong, like right on the street corners, and, you know, knowing of all that that goes on, I would think it's like Hong Kong, Taiwan, those would be the types of places that would be the tops for piracy, but Italy?

553
00:34:35,292 --> 00:34:43,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, pardon my ignorance for those overseas listeners, but I've never even been over to the other side of the Atlantic, so sorry, I know we have a lot of listeners over there because we try to

554
00:34:44,498 --> 00:34:47,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Let every gamer have a voice, including our friends from overseas.

555
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:53,966
[SPEAKER_05]: But is there something about Italy where the distribution that gets to the rest of Europe doesn't get there or something?

556
00:34:54,226 --> 00:34:54,847
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea.

557
00:34:55,407 --> 00:35:03,093
[SPEAKER_04]: But they said also that of those 10 million, those aren't even really a full picture of what's being downloaded.

558
00:35:03,474 --> 00:35:07,317
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's just all Modern Warfare 2 is probably what it was.

559
00:35:07,918 --> 00:35:37,209
[SPEAKER_05]: well because my thought is you know is that I've gotten into this topic before and I don't know if it was on a call with Bobby's show at the end or if it was on this show but that I think a lot of this piracy comes from folks that can't get the game through legal means turn to piracy and that's why I kind of question well does Italy get game releases when the rest of you know those countries over there get them or is there something about Italy where in Spain and some of those other countries you named where they don't get the games at the same time so people turn to piracy

560
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:44,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there laws where maybe the game has to be in a local language, like Italian or Spanish, so they can't release them there?

561
00:35:44,314 --> 00:35:44,595
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

562
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:45,075
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

563
00:35:45,195 --> 00:35:53,441
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really hear a lot of just, you know, I don't really hear of anything being delayed there, but I mean, I don't really know.

564
00:35:53,481 --> 00:35:58,265
[SPEAKER_04]: We never hear like, you know, Italy's not getting the game because it's been censored or something like that.

565
00:35:58,285 --> 00:36:01,327
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always Germany or New Zealand or Australia.

566
00:36:01,547 --> 00:36:02,468
[SPEAKER_11]: They got to catch them all.

567
00:36:03,345 --> 00:36:06,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I would love to hear from a listener, because I know we have some listeners over there.

568
00:36:06,606 --> 00:36:10,447
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you are listening and you're one of those countries Loki named, I would love to get an email from you.

569
00:36:11,188 --> 00:36:13,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do you think piracy is so rampant where you live?

570
00:36:13,828 --> 00:36:17,250
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, is the legal just difficult or expensive or what?

571
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think...

572
00:36:19,941 --> 00:36:22,283
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, why do people turn to piracy in the US?

573
00:36:22,363 --> 00:36:25,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they blame the $60 price point of a console game.

574
00:36:26,386 --> 00:36:29,588
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm too poor, I'm a starving student, or whatever it is.

575
00:36:29,848 --> 00:36:35,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Try to justify it with the whole Robin Hood philosophy of steal from the rich and give to the poor.

576
00:36:35,973 --> 00:36:38,915
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what motivates most piracy.

577
00:36:40,016 --> 00:36:42,338
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying a good thing about that, I'm just saying what I see.

578
00:36:42,638 --> 00:36:43,899
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just kind of what it seems to be.

579
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:45,200
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the whole Robin Hood approach.

580
00:36:47,234 --> 00:36:49,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, well, be careful.

581
00:36:49,255 --> 00:36:51,315
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it's as altruistic as Robin Hood's intent.

582
00:36:52,655 --> 00:36:54,596
[SPEAKER_11]: It's rob from the rich and give to me.

583
00:36:55,476 --> 00:36:56,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, fair enough.

584
00:36:57,297 --> 00:37:00,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of piracy, you might want to be a little bit careful if you're into that.

585
00:37:00,497 --> 00:37:02,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep in mind, piracy is not legal.

586
00:37:03,038 --> 00:37:03,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a reminder.

587
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,538
[SPEAKER_05]: So you are walking a dangerous line.

588
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:09,839
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is evidenced by what's going on in Australia right now.

589
00:37:09,899 --> 00:37:12,200
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, when I first read this story, I was like,

590
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,161
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

591
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:39,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, Gadgetgear.com.au, because all the Australian ones ended AU, they were actually told they have to stop selling the device.

592
00:37:39,524 --> 00:37:44,687
[SPEAKER_05]: They got fined the equivalent of $466,000 US dollars.

593
00:37:45,587 --> 00:37:56,292
[SPEAKER_05]: The folks that were named in the suit, Patrick Lee and James Lee, I guess they also kind of sold this independently, not through the same site, but they also were fined $100,000 Australian.

594
00:37:56,332 --> 00:37:57,613
[SPEAKER_05]: That's about $90,000 here Australian.

595
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:06,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, what I think is interesting as part of the settlement, or I'm sorry, not settlement, but suit, they have to disclose who is supplying the R4 chips.

596
00:38:07,307 --> 00:38:07,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

597
00:38:08,508 --> 00:38:14,332
[SPEAKER_05]: So that again is just, that's the second in like a week's time of Nintendo winning some anti-piracy stuff.

598
00:38:14,352 --> 00:38:22,817
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's dumb that they, you know, I mean, those chips, I understand that they can be used for piracy, but a computer can be used for piracy.

599
00:38:22,957 --> 00:38:26,220
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, we're going to make computers legal now too?

600
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:32,744
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's just, you have to go after the, sadly enough, you have to go after the people that are using the pirate stuff.

601
00:38:33,384 --> 00:38:36,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, I don't know, here's a thought, go after people putting ROMs online.

602
00:38:37,908 --> 00:38:44,337
[SPEAKER_04]: it won't matter if you have the stupid chip for your DS because it won't work with anything there's no fucking ROMs out there

603
00:38:46,209 --> 00:38:48,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Oddly enough, I kind of agree with you.

604
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:53,934
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think your computer analogy, even though I don't own an R4 and I don't think I would get into all this stuff.

605
00:38:54,314 --> 00:38:55,755
[SPEAKER_05]: I have two and a G3.

606
00:38:57,055 --> 00:38:57,976
[SPEAKER_11]: I have two Ninja Passes.

607
00:38:59,217 --> 00:39:01,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

608
00:39:01,998 --> 00:39:04,240
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like I'm too stupid to really get into all that stuff.

609
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:09,203
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what it is, but I think if I had one, I'd want to play homebrew stuff on it is probably what I would be into.

610
00:39:09,243 --> 00:39:09,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's pretty fun.

611
00:39:10,803 --> 00:39:15,584
[SPEAKER_05]: I like having the real deal because then I know I'm going to get online and not get my system bricked and all that.

612
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:18,045
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm willing to pay the extra money just for ease of mind in that regard.

613
00:39:19,725 --> 00:39:31,528
[SPEAKER_05]: But as far as the R4 stuff goes, I think when you buy a device like that, yeah, I should be able to use the parts for whatever I want as long as I'm not – I get the problem with piracy.

614
00:39:31,548 --> 00:39:35,509
[SPEAKER_05]: You're stealing someone else's property that they spent money to create.

615
00:39:35,529 --> 00:39:36,649
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going after the wrong people.

616
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:47,961
[SPEAKER_05]: But if somebody wants to put a free ROM on the internet for their free public domain, just like somebody puts their music up on MySpace, they want you to download it and listen to it to get their band name out there.

617
00:39:48,221 --> 00:39:58,633
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like people, it'd be like going after somebody or a camcorder company because somebody used it to pirate a film.

618
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:00,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

619
00:40:22,659 --> 00:40:22,979
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

620
00:40:41,055 --> 00:40:41,575
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

621
00:41:10,149 --> 00:41:11,249
[SPEAKER_04]: I even got bored of that.

622
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:13,850
[SPEAKER_04]: I shouldn't be getting bored of a Zelda game.

623
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:15,651
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on, it's Zelda.

624
00:41:15,691 --> 00:41:16,291
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.

625
00:41:17,471 --> 00:41:21,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think maybe your expectations have kind of raised?

626
00:41:21,232 --> 00:41:27,654
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but they didn't really do that much different other than, look, now Link's riding a train instead of a boat.

627
00:41:28,174 --> 00:41:30,034
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's the same damn game.

628
00:41:30,194 --> 00:41:34,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'm going to take the tangent train for a minute here, but we kind of got into it a couple weeks ago on the show.

629
00:41:34,956 --> 00:41:38,577
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember talking about Game Room and some of these old arcade games and Atari 2600 games.

630
00:41:39,657 --> 00:41:57,808
[SPEAKER_05]: and some folks saying that you know they're repetitive they're boring and I'm thinking that's what it was all about back when you know those games first came out what's wrong with you you know like are we just have our expectations about what makes a good game like changed in that regard I guess they have to some extent you know you it would be like this

631
00:41:58,468 --> 00:42:02,409
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be like saying, okay, I'm playing Pac-Man.

632
00:42:02,869 --> 00:42:03,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Pac-Man's cool.

633
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:11,172
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we come out with Pac-Man 2, which is exactly the same as Pac-Man 1, except now the screen is blue and purple instead of yellow and blue.

634
00:42:11,592 --> 00:42:13,953
[SPEAKER_04]: That's basically the difference between... That's Ms.

635
00:42:13,973 --> 00:42:14,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Pac-Man.

636
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:16,754
[SPEAKER_04]: But she has a bow in her hair.

637
00:42:16,774 --> 00:42:18,754
[SPEAKER_04]: She has a bow, and it's slightly different.

638
00:42:18,794 --> 00:42:27,197
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, seriously, it's almost like they've said, okay, what can we do to put the least amount of effort into this so we can release a sequel really quick?

639
00:42:28,317 --> 00:42:29,178
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, I understand.

640
00:42:29,258 --> 00:42:33,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, it's... I mean, they don't even try to tie any of the games storyline-wise together.

641
00:42:34,581 --> 00:42:47,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes, it's another adventurer who happens to look the same as Link, and his name is Link, and now he's gotta go rescue this Princess Zelda, who's not the same Princess Zelda, even though she looked exactly the same as the last game.

642
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:49,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't they gotta do that in all the Zelda games?

643
00:42:50,512 --> 00:42:52,713
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

644
00:43:20,006 --> 00:43:28,808
[SPEAKER_11]: No, there is a bit more about EA servers being a big clank putting on them.

645
00:43:29,668 --> 00:43:48,932
[SPEAKER_11]: On March 16th, we have service shutdown for Death Jam for PS3, Godfather for PS3 and Xbox 360, Lord of the Rings Conquest, Mercenaries 2, Need for Speed Carbon on portable, Need for Speed Pro Street PSP, Simpsons for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and

646
00:43:50,132 --> 00:43:55,215
[SPEAKER_11]: April 15th, Burnout 3, Takedown, Army of Two for PS3, but that's only in Asia.

647
00:43:56,316 --> 00:44:02,959
[SPEAKER_11]: And, of course, we have a ton of original Xbox being shut down after that and PS2 games.

648
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:09,503
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, pretty much everything that's Xbox, PS2 earlier, and Tiger Woods.

649
00:44:11,044 --> 00:44:11,184
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

650
00:44:12,073 --> 00:44:18,116
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm surprised that, I mean, there's some of the games on there, like Simpsons, I don't remember there being online for that.

651
00:44:18,896 --> 00:44:26,239
[SPEAKER_04]: It was funny, though, because even, like, Def Jam Icon, that was one of those games, oh, yeah, you can put your music in there and, you know, play and stuff.

652
00:44:26,299 --> 00:44:32,442
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, oh, yeah, if we put some weird, like, DDR music in there, that'd be really funny, because it's meant for more, like, hip-hop stuff.

653
00:44:32,542 --> 00:44:32,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

654
00:44:33,862 --> 00:44:34,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well.

655
00:44:34,643 --> 00:44:34,883
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

656
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:39,044
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not really surprising.

657
00:44:39,264 --> 00:44:42,228
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it costs money to run the servers.

658
00:44:43,229 --> 00:44:49,516
[SPEAKER_11]: And if they're not making any more money on these games and new stuff's going to be coming out, what's the point of keeping it around?

659
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:53,845
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of companies out there that don't really have these servers that they shut down.

660
00:44:54,005 --> 00:44:58,669
[SPEAKER_04]: EA is the main one we hear about every now and then.

661
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:05,055
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we had one from Sega when they shut down the server for Chromehounds.

662
00:45:05,956 --> 00:45:10,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the only ones I've heard of for a while.

663
00:45:11,321 --> 00:45:12,062
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of interesting.

664
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:19,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and, you know, Xbox original getting shut down is, you know, somewhat notable, you know.

665
00:45:20,116 --> 00:45:22,038
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's just a matter of time.

666
00:45:22,618 --> 00:45:26,801
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't understand, like, current generation stuff, the servers being shut down for them.

667
00:45:26,841 --> 00:45:28,362
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's just kind of weird.

668
00:45:29,123 --> 00:45:36,048
[SPEAKER_04]: I can understand, like, you know, okay, yeah, we're moving on to the PlayStation 4, you know, the PlayStation Network for PlayStation 3 is going to have to go away now.

669
00:45:36,128 --> 00:45:40,471
[SPEAKER_11]: But keep in mind, also looking, again, economy-wise, you know,

670
00:45:41,883 --> 00:45:43,704
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of companies are losing money anyway.

671
00:45:43,864 --> 00:45:47,466
[SPEAKER_11]: If they're trying to mitigate... I fully believe that it's to mitigate cost.

672
00:45:47,706 --> 00:45:48,106
[SPEAKER_11]: I really do.

673
00:45:48,646 --> 00:45:49,506
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's part of it too.

674
00:45:49,587 --> 00:45:53,868
[SPEAKER_05]: And Loki, as you said earlier, you play Grand Theft Auto and nobody's ever online.

675
00:45:55,149 --> 00:45:57,370
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of surprised they're not threatening to pull the plug on that.

676
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:59,611
[SPEAKER_05]: If people aren't using it, it's costing them to keep the servers up.

677
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:01,032
[SPEAKER_04]: They are just not playing what I'm playing.

678
00:46:01,192 --> 00:46:01,472
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

679
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:09,141
[SPEAKER_04]: There's specific settings because we play with auto-aim off and some newbie players out there like to play with auto-aim on.

680
00:46:09,161 --> 00:46:10,763
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be me.

681
00:46:11,765 --> 00:46:19,034
[SPEAKER_04]: And so because of that, anybody that's searching for a game with auto-aim on, they're only going to find auto-aim on games.

682
00:46:19,194 --> 00:46:20,496
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to specify that.

683
00:46:20,876 --> 00:46:21,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

684
00:46:37,479 --> 00:46:56,325
[SPEAKER_04]: for um the battle league atony there's at least 50,000 people on the ranked leaderboards um right now so um there's a lot of people out there it's just you know whether they may be wanting to play just free mode or just you know some other you know deathmatch non-ranked you know team deathmatch who knows

685
00:46:58,089 --> 00:47:01,871
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to join us.

686
00:47:02,532 --> 00:47:07,375
[SPEAKER_05]: X-Link reminds us they've also shut down the servers for the PS2 and PC versions of Phantasy Star Universe.

687
00:47:07,415 --> 00:47:08,756
[SPEAKER_05]: That was another big recent one.

688
00:47:09,176 --> 00:47:12,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Phantasy Star Universe is starting to disappear, which is a pretty big deal.

689
00:47:12,758 --> 00:47:15,760
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm kind of not surprised a lot of the communities on Xbox 360.

690
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:19,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't that the only way you had the voice enabled in it too?

691
00:47:19,523 --> 00:47:20,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe, yeah.

692
00:47:21,144 --> 00:47:23,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, of course you could always use something like Ventrilo or something on the PC, I suppose.

693
00:47:25,066 --> 00:47:26,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's move on.

694
00:47:47,003 --> 00:47:53,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, that doesn't sound too bad right now, but there's a few things, of course, you have to understand.

695
00:47:54,345 --> 00:48:14,811
[SPEAKER_04]: The system is kind of flawed, and the reason being is, for example, if your connection experiences any sort of issue, whether it be like drop in bandwidth or momentary pause, router reboot, or whatever, the software will immediately boot you out of your game back to the main menu, and you'll lose all your progress.

696
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:21,034
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it.

697
00:48:21,454 --> 00:48:33,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, if Ubisoft's master servers encounter any errors, then all the players with a working connection logged into the servers will not be able to play their games until the servers are back online.

698
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:37,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh gee, Ubisoft's customer support isn't about to blow up or anything.

699
00:48:38,243 --> 00:48:42,628
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know... Doesn't Ubisoft make the, like, Imagine games?

700
00:48:43,068 --> 00:48:43,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they do.

701
00:48:43,569 --> 00:48:47,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I imagine there's equivalents of that on the PC, right?

702
00:48:47,553 --> 00:48:52,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the main... The two titles that are going to be coming up... And this is a Korean PC game where they tested...

703
00:48:52,699 --> 00:48:55,821
[SPEAKER_04]: The two upcoming titles, Assassin's Creed 2 and Settlers 7.

704
00:48:58,062 --> 00:49:03,084
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they have any Imagine games for a PC, but they would have this DRM if they did.

705
00:49:03,465 --> 00:49:04,905
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's where I'm going with this.

706
00:49:04,965 --> 00:49:11,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Not everybody that would be buying a game like that is tech-savvy enough to understand what DRM even is.

707
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:13,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly not.

708
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:19,853
[SPEAKER_05]: The type of people that buy those Imagine games are probably not the same people that listen to this podcast, unless of course they're buying it for their kids.

709
00:49:20,413 --> 00:49:20,674
[SPEAKER_05]: You know...

710
00:49:21,814 --> 00:49:33,767
[SPEAKER_05]: My point is, you're going to have these moms buying it for their daughters and people that don't really follow gaming or understand what DRM even is that just know the game isn't going to fire up on the computer.

711
00:49:33,807 --> 00:49:35,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's going to get the phone call about that?

712
00:49:35,448 --> 00:49:40,434
[SPEAKER_05]: The phone calls are going to go to Ubisoft or they're going to go to Targets and Walmarts across the country.

713
00:49:41,074 --> 00:49:44,157
[SPEAKER_05]: And when that starts happening, they're going to stop carrying it.

714
00:49:44,958 --> 00:49:52,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, and I have a feeling that this will be cracked in probably a few days.

715
00:49:52,288 --> 00:49:55,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, usually those types of things are, and people are going to turn to that.

716
00:49:56,218 --> 00:49:57,959
[SPEAKER_04]: And sadly, what's going to end up happening?

717
00:49:57,979 --> 00:50:06,542
[SPEAKER_05]: But unfortunately, soccer mom Jones, who buys this for her daughter, you'll imagine, I don't know, dress-up shop or whatever they come out with.

718
00:50:06,722 --> 00:50:07,903
[SPEAKER_05]: How many of those Imagine games are there?

719
00:50:07,923 --> 00:50:08,723
[SPEAKER_05]: We were at Target last night.

720
00:50:08,743 --> 00:50:09,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Too many.

721
00:50:09,323 --> 00:50:10,984
[SPEAKER_05]: How many of those Imagine games were there on the shelf, Alan?

722
00:50:11,024 --> 00:50:12,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Like 5,000, right?

723
00:50:12,745 --> 00:50:13,585
[SPEAKER_05]: At least a dozen, yeah.

724
00:50:13,925 --> 00:50:15,846
[SPEAKER_05]: What were some Imagine titles that caught your eye?

725
00:50:17,921 --> 00:50:23,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Right next to Cooking Mama, 1, 2, 3, and Gardening Mama, and just everything.

726
00:50:23,846 --> 00:50:24,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Crazy.

727
00:50:25,927 --> 00:50:30,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, while we're talking about online authentication, I think this is kind of interesting.

728
00:50:30,251 --> 00:50:37,797
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost like a combination of the past couple stories we've been hearing about server costs to maintain, as well as a little bit about the DRM.

729
00:50:39,197 --> 00:50:41,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Socom, Fireteam, Bravo 3.

730
00:50:41,978 --> 00:50:51,000
[SPEAKER_05]: If you are going to be playing this game on the PSP, you're going to get a code so that you can go and redeem it on the PlayStation Network and you'll be able to access the game online.

731
00:50:51,540 --> 00:51:03,262
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you don't buy this game either directly through PSM because it will automatically be enabled or you get the code new, you'll have to shell out $20 to get the license to let you play online.

732
00:51:03,722 --> 00:51:04,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about that for a minute.

733
00:51:04,863 --> 00:51:05,963
[SPEAKER_05]: What that basically means is

734
00:51:06,543 --> 00:51:21,204
[SPEAKER_05]: they're kind of targeting people who are going after this used or the people who buy this second hand because think about it if you buy it new you'll get a code if you buy it online you don't need a code because you bought it online but if you buy it used no code for you well it's for piracy really

735
00:51:22,295 --> 00:51:22,555
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

736
00:51:43,962 --> 00:51:47,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony actually has a workaround for it in their own system.

737
00:51:48,143 --> 00:51:52,005
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason this is, granted, you can't play online games.

738
00:51:52,685 --> 00:51:59,847
[SPEAKER_04]: But thanks to that wonderful, and I don't remember what the hell it's called now, but remember how you can do ad hoc over the internet with Sony PlayStation 3?

739
00:52:01,007 --> 00:52:04,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, guess I don't need to go online to play other people online.

740
00:52:04,709 --> 00:52:09,010
[SPEAKER_04]: I can just go ad hoc over the internet, and it works just fine.

741
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:10,250
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not lag city or anything?

742
00:52:10,571 --> 00:52:11,131
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it shouldn't be.

743
00:52:11,371 --> 00:52:11,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

744
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:31,669
[SPEAKER_05]: by the way John Culler from Sony actually was quoted to IGN saying it's quote a trial run for a new initiative we are exploring for the platform so even if you're like ah fuck it I don't play SOCOM this could still be in the future impacting a game you play they're waiting to see how long it's cracked and it probably will get cracked somehow

745
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:36,011
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't think the used thing has anything to do with it?

746
00:52:36,191 --> 00:52:37,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sure that it has a little bit to do with it.

747
00:52:37,992 --> 00:52:43,235
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why they also were testing out the market with, like, Member Local... Not Local Roku 2.

748
00:52:44,476 --> 00:52:45,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Patapon 2, I think.

749
00:52:46,117 --> 00:52:51,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Where they had the game in a retail box, but all it was was a card with a scratch-off code.

750
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:53,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

751
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,261
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw that at Fry's, yeah.

752
00:52:54,561 --> 00:52:55,742
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so that's another thing.

753
00:52:55,762 --> 00:52:57,443
[SPEAKER_04]: They were test marketing, so...

754
00:52:58,664 --> 00:53:03,469
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just thinking, if I were to pick up this game used, I'd be kind of irritated that then I have to go online and pay another $20.

755
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:08,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, again, here we go with the angry phone calls from people who don't know better to this time GameStop.

756
00:53:09,195 --> 00:53:18,285
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I were GameStop, you know, and you can use that term loosely to describe whatever game store makes their bread and butter off of used games and happens to sell new games as well, I'd be kind of pissed.

757
00:53:18,345 --> 00:53:18,785
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would...

758
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:47,753
[SPEAKER_05]: like can you imagine especially with such a powerhouse that GameStop is and we'll just throw in all the other you know like companies in there okay like the powerhouse that they are with something like this kind of going after their used market can you imagine if they were to say and they have the power to do this they run a magazine for heaven's sake they could discourage people from buying the game think about it what's to stop I mean this this might be a little conspiracy theory here but what's to stop GameStop from publishing a negative review in this game

759
00:53:48,493 --> 00:54:04,933
[SPEAKER_05]: and Game Informer which is the most popular video game magazine out there that happens to be run by GameStop to discourage people from buying this game for no other reason than it cuts into the used game market but yet they use this whole they're going to get to with the $20 thing as the reason but the real reason is the bottom line of the game stores

760
00:54:05,273 --> 00:54:05,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

761
00:54:21,738 --> 00:54:40,559
[SPEAKER_04]: but I would think at the same time that this could be bad for Sony anyways because when a competing game comes out there let's see, am I going to buy the game that won't let me play online unless I pay $20 or the other game that's equally cool that I can play online for free that's a tough one I will go with the free one

762
00:54:43,139 --> 00:54:48,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, TigerClaw in our chatroom, chat.orange.com says, I wonder, what if Sony sells this game in twos?

763
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:52,269
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, what if you want to only buy the multiplayer part?

764
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:55,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Couldn't you just purchase the multiplayer game itself and not the full single player?

765
00:54:57,255 --> 00:54:58,817
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's the problem, too, with the SOCOM 3.

766
00:54:59,217 --> 00:54:59,878
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not...

767
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,600
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a discounted game.

768
00:55:04,241 --> 00:55:05,701
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a full-price game.

769
00:55:06,661 --> 00:55:16,844
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's not like, hey, we're selling this for $20, but if you want to go online, you can pay the other $20, and then equal the cost of a full-price game.

770
00:55:17,224 --> 00:55:19,445
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's nothing like that, where they're offering it at a discount.

771
00:55:19,565 --> 00:55:22,286
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a full-price game, and then you have to pay another $20 on top of it.

772
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:23,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what I say.

773
00:55:23,908 --> 00:55:25,289
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't like it, don't buy it.

774
00:55:25,949 --> 00:55:26,449
[SPEAKER_05]: End of story.

775
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:27,991
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's really what it is.

776
00:55:28,031 --> 00:55:28,971
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't like it, don't buy it.

777
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:32,174
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I mean, a game like this, SOCOM has its fan base.

778
00:55:32,914 --> 00:55:36,136
[SPEAKER_05]: There's people that aren't even going to bat an eye at this because they're already going to buy the game new.

779
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:37,557
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll find a way.

780
00:55:39,138 --> 00:55:39,759
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see what happens.

781
00:55:40,479 --> 00:55:41,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on with some more stories.

782
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:45,343
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got release dates coming up as well as the classic game of the week in a little bit here on Orange Launch Radio.

783
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:48,557
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, this is some good news.

784
00:55:48,677 --> 00:55:49,498
[SPEAKER_11]: How about something happy?

785
00:55:49,598 --> 00:55:50,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay, happy.

786
00:55:50,278 --> 00:55:51,779
[SPEAKER_11]: At least happy for me because I'm playing it.

787
00:55:51,799 --> 00:55:52,780
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to give me money?

788
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:53,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

789
00:55:53,701 --> 00:55:54,561
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not playing that game.

790
00:55:54,581 --> 00:55:56,382
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so happy.

791
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:57,743
[SPEAKER_11]: Star Trek.

792
00:55:58,164 --> 00:55:59,004
[SPEAKER_11]: Star Trek Online.

793
00:55:59,684 --> 00:56:06,329
[SPEAKER_11]: They are actually working on ways of opening up the ship so that you can explore more of your own ship.

794
00:56:07,269 --> 00:56:10,371
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, so far all you can do is go hang out on the bridge and that's kind of boring.

795
00:56:10,792 --> 00:56:14,034
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I look at my Andorian dude just, you know, piloting.

796
00:56:14,074 --> 00:56:15,875
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, okay, he's piloting.

797
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:18,387
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

798
00:56:38,784 --> 00:56:39,905
[SPEAKER_11]: It is happy for me.

799
00:56:40,246 --> 00:56:41,427
[SPEAKER_11]: I said it was happy for me.

800
00:56:42,147 --> 00:56:49,313
[SPEAKER_11]: But they basically want to make it more, you know, do what they can to make it more like actual Star Trek.

801
00:56:50,414 --> 00:56:56,700
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is something that they've quoted as saying that it's something that they want to do, but they're not going to implement it until they have it working flawlessly.

802
00:56:57,981 --> 00:56:58,361
[SPEAKER_05]: I want a holodeck.

803
00:56:58,381 --> 00:56:58,421
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

804
00:57:13,345 --> 00:57:14,786
[SPEAKER_11]: Starboard Bow, Starboard Bow, Starboard Bow

805
00:57:43,342 --> 00:57:44,623
[SPEAKER_11]: That was nerdier than what I said.

806
00:58:09,684 --> 00:58:16,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, on Xbox 360, Risen, the ever-delayed game now coming out on Xbox 360.

807
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:18,251
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe the PC version came out last October.

808
00:58:19,552 --> 00:58:22,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, lovely Lisa and Friends on the DS.

809
00:58:22,474 --> 00:58:25,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently it's from the Tommy Corporation.

810
00:58:25,056 --> 00:58:26,758
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it's a doll that's actually in Japan.

811
00:58:27,018 --> 00:58:29,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Why this is being brought out over here is beyond me.

812
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Because she's lovely.

813
00:58:30,621 --> 00:58:30,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess...

814
00:58:32,302 --> 00:58:38,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii DS, and PSP.

815
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:46,231
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, that's going to feature all your favorite Sega characters.

816
00:58:46,812 --> 00:58:50,414
[SPEAKER_04]: And Banjo-Kazooie, of course, in the Xbox 360 version.

817
00:58:53,156 --> 00:58:54,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see here.

818
00:58:57,256 --> 00:59:11,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello Kitty Birthday Adventures on DS Napoleon Total War coming out on PC Pony Friends 2 coming out on DS Anything our listeners might actually want to buy?

819
00:59:13,118 --> 00:59:15,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, you're saying Pony Friends 2 is not on the top of their list?

820
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,282
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm thinking no.

821
00:59:17,482 --> 00:59:19,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's too bad.

822
00:59:19,984 --> 00:59:22,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Heavy Rain coming out on PlayStation 3 this week as well.

823
00:59:23,647 --> 00:59:26,890
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, let's see, wrapping it up.

824
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Deck of Sports on DS.

825
00:59:31,714 --> 00:59:33,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Deck of Sports was the one that had curling in it, right?

826
00:59:34,697 --> 00:59:37,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I'm not sure if the DS version has curling in it.

827
00:59:38,059 --> 00:59:39,661
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Winter Olympics time of year.

828
00:59:40,512 --> 00:59:41,733
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

829
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:56,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

830
00:59:56,241 --> 00:59:56,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

831
00:59:57,301 --> 01:00:03,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming out on February 25th on the Xbox 360, a localized version of Borderlands comes out from 2K Games.

832
01:00:03,466 --> 01:00:06,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Also a game called Esp Galuda 2.

833
01:00:07,229 --> 01:00:10,312
[SPEAKER_05]: A black label comes out in limited edition and regular formats.

834
01:00:10,352 --> 01:00:11,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, there's a 2 there.

835
01:00:11,433 --> 01:00:13,514
[SPEAKER_05]: It is the sequel to Esp Galuda.

836
01:00:13,554 --> 01:00:15,416
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you've never heard of it, that's because it's a shmup.

837
01:00:15,896 --> 01:00:16,537
[SPEAKER_05]: So shoot them up.

838
01:00:17,038 --> 01:00:22,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Very colorful, seizure-inducing graphics where most of your screen is taken up with an overlay because it's a vertical shooter.

839
01:00:22,707 --> 01:00:25,852
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know there are some hardcore shmup fans out there.

840
01:00:27,788 --> 01:00:30,009
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm sure they'll be picking this up without delay.

841
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:37,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, No Fate, Only the Power of Will comes out from Alchemist on February the 25th on the Xbox 360.

842
01:00:37,271 --> 01:00:38,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Not sure what this game's all about.

843
01:00:39,011 --> 01:00:44,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, it's got anime girls all over it, but this chick who's getting out of the pool is kind of angry.

844
01:00:44,193 --> 01:00:45,353
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why she's so angry.

845
01:00:45,393 --> 01:00:46,133
[SPEAKER_05]: She's getting out of the pool there.

846
01:00:46,153 --> 01:00:46,634
[SPEAKER_05]: She looks like Atena.

847
01:00:46,894 --> 01:00:49,595
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an adventure game, and this other chick's just dreaming.

848
01:00:49,875 --> 01:00:53,476
[SPEAKER_05]: But I like to think that maybe she is looking at the chick getting out of the pool, and that's what's making her angry.

849
01:00:53,856 --> 01:00:54,136
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

850
01:00:54,836 --> 01:00:59,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, that made for a much funnier in-studio than it did radio.

851
01:00:59,140 --> 01:00:59,921
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize for that.

852
01:01:00,742 --> 01:01:02,644
[SPEAKER_11]: I snorted my root beer if that makes you feel better.

853
01:01:02,704 --> 01:01:03,324
[SPEAKER_05]: It does, a little bit.

854
01:01:03,605 --> 01:01:05,687
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is no curling in DexportsDS.

855
01:01:06,397 --> 01:01:06,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Fail.

856
01:01:07,618 --> 01:01:08,658
[SPEAKER_05]: A million times fail.

857
01:01:09,279 --> 01:01:11,880
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation 3, a price reduction on Demon's Souls.

858
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,801
[SPEAKER_05]: If you haven't picked that up yet, you really should.

859
01:01:14,101 --> 01:01:14,582
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.

860
01:01:14,622 --> 01:01:21,085
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty much the only thing to look forward to on PlayStation 3 unless you need some new HDMI cables because some third parties are putting some more of those out.

861
01:01:21,526 --> 01:01:27,749
[SPEAKER_05]: But the Nintendo Wii has a lot this week, which is good because they've had some quiet weeks lately, including Ark Rise Fantasia is coming out.

862
01:01:28,409 --> 01:01:30,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Minas No Susume selection.

863
01:01:30,471 --> 01:01:32,492
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that might be just a price reduction then.

864
01:01:32,512 --> 01:01:34,373
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, yeah, Ark Rise Fantasia I think has already been out.

865
01:01:34,953 --> 01:01:36,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a price reduction there.

866
01:01:36,114 --> 01:01:37,455
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like a best hits over there.

867
01:01:38,075 --> 01:01:41,817
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as new games go, Rajironogia Wii.

868
01:01:42,078 --> 01:01:44,519
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the sequel to Radergy.

869
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:46,600
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I'm even saying that right.

870
01:01:47,121 --> 01:01:47,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Radergy.

871
01:01:47,881 --> 01:01:48,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Radergy.

872
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:50,363
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like an extra R in here.

873
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:53,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Another shmup, basically, but this time on the Wii.

874
01:01:53,665 --> 01:01:55,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Radio Allergy, as it's called over here.

875
01:01:55,686 --> 01:01:57,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Fushigi no Dungeon, Furai no Shiren 4, Kami no Hitomi no Akuma no Heso

876
01:02:22,369 --> 01:02:22,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Mystery Dungeon

877
01:02:37,972 --> 01:02:41,878
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's a... I don't know what language.

878
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:45,223
[SPEAKER_05]: But the guy's wearing kind of a funny hat.

879
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,144
[SPEAKER_11]: He's got a monkey.

880
01:02:46,444 --> 01:02:48,607
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the funny hat game featuring monkey.

881
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:52,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Super Robot Taisen OG Saga.

882
01:02:53,474 --> 01:02:55,055
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a series we can't get rid of.

883
01:02:55,075 --> 01:02:55,535
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

884
01:02:55,595 --> 01:02:56,416
[SPEAKER_05]: It's never going away.

885
01:02:56,896 --> 01:03:07,182
[SPEAKER_05]: And on the PSP, BlazBlue Portable comes out this week as well as Katekyou Hitman Reborn, Kizuna No Tag Battle, which is, of course, a fighting game.

886
01:03:07,202 --> 01:03:09,143
[SPEAKER_05]: You can tell they're on the PSP.

887
01:03:09,724 --> 01:03:15,147
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if this is based off an anime, but this looks like that one where you can do four people at a time all playing at once.

888
01:03:16,308 --> 01:03:16,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks like fun.

889
01:03:17,508 --> 01:03:19,850
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to do it for your Japanese release dates.

890
01:03:20,957 --> 01:03:24,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Metal Slug XX Metal Slug XX Metal Slug XX Metal Slug

891
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:55,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's do just a couple more stories and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week and I believe DarkSakura has picked a true classic for you guys tonight.

892
01:03:56,012 --> 01:03:57,634
[SPEAKER_11]: It better like it.

893
01:03:58,254 --> 01:04:01,278
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I picked the most piss your pants title I could think of.

894
01:04:01,799 --> 01:04:04,703
[SPEAKER_04]: And it ties in with a game that we had coming out this week as well.

895
01:04:06,809 --> 01:04:07,550
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get there in a minute.

896
01:04:30,872 --> 01:04:33,615
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why they're... I didn't even know there were sci-fi kids.

897
01:04:33,975 --> 01:04:35,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they make crappy children's shows too?

898
01:04:35,977 --> 01:04:36,317
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know.

899
01:04:36,357 --> 01:04:40,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they did like a Wizard of Oz and an Alice in Wonderland.

900
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:43,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, which were all really like... They were like dark, weren't they?

901
01:04:43,723 --> 01:04:44,484
[SPEAKER_04]: They were weird.

902
01:04:44,784 --> 01:04:45,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

903
01:04:46,306 --> 01:04:46,666
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

904
01:04:47,767 --> 01:04:54,113
[SPEAKER_04]: So apparently, though, they're going to be working with the Diplob character.

905
01:04:54,253 --> 01:04:55,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe there'll be a cartoon show.

906
01:04:55,675 --> 01:04:56,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

907
01:04:57,216 --> 01:04:58,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Will a Cylon show up?

908
01:04:58,458 --> 01:05:01,100
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, maybe there's Battlestar Galactica, Caprica.

909
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:02,382
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think there's anything there.

910
01:05:02,422 --> 01:05:05,525
[SPEAKER_05]: When I think of sci-fi network, I think of BSG.

911
01:05:05,605 --> 01:05:06,145
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't help it.

912
01:05:06,245 --> 01:05:08,848
[SPEAKER_04]: I think of crappy sci-fi movies that are normally on there.

913
01:05:08,888 --> 01:05:09,589
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

914
01:05:09,649 --> 01:05:10,589
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that?

915
01:05:10,689 --> 01:05:11,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that from Sci-Fi Network?

916
01:05:11,530 --> 01:05:12,811
[SPEAKER_05]: The shark meet octopus?

917
01:05:12,891 --> 01:05:13,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Or what is it?

918
01:05:13,712 --> 01:05:14,653
[SPEAKER_05]: The flying shark?

919
01:05:14,673 --> 01:05:16,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, where the shark eats a plane out of the sky.

920
01:05:16,914 --> 01:05:17,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

921
01:05:17,395 --> 01:05:17,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

922
01:05:18,255 --> 01:05:19,736
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all those lovely Sci-Fi movies.

923
01:05:19,757 --> 01:05:21,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they show them on the soup all the time, right?

924
01:05:21,778 --> 01:05:22,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

925
01:05:22,178 --> 01:05:22,679
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, good times.

926
01:05:22,699 --> 01:05:23,600
[SPEAKER_12]: With Deborah Gibson.

927
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:24,220
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

928
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:26,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, she's a woman now, so no longer Debbie.

929
01:05:26,802 --> 01:05:27,182
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

930
01:05:28,383 --> 01:05:36,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then the other thing, of course, the blob is also gonna be not just on the Wii this time, it's also supposed to be coming to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

931
01:05:37,766 --> 01:05:43,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, also, there's gonna be some new Saints Row and Red Faction at E3 this year.

932
01:05:43,809 --> 01:05:54,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, of course, Saints Row 3 is not supposed to be coming out until 2011, which makes me very sad, but the new Red Faction game is supposed to be slated for later this year, so, um, that might be cool.

933
01:05:55,013 --> 01:05:55,733
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, um,

934
01:05:57,646 --> 01:06:00,564
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess we'll have to wait until E3 to check those out.

935
01:06:01,843 --> 01:06:06,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I have to go back to the sci-fi thing for a minute because, like, the blob game, yeah, that's cool.

936
01:06:06,766 --> 01:06:10,168
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember playing the blob at PAX a couple years ago, of all places.

937
01:06:10,208 --> 01:06:12,430
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, and I remember Loki really enjoyed it, too.

938
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:13,370
[SPEAKER_05]: So don't get me wrong.

939
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:17,233
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad that game is getting a sequel if sci-fi is putting it out or however it's coming out.

940
01:06:17,553 --> 01:06:19,354
[SPEAKER_05]: But seriously... It's still THQ, yeah.

941
01:06:19,454 --> 01:06:23,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Why aren't they making, like, the shark and octopus video game?

942
01:06:23,777 --> 01:06:29,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, when Alan was saying that sharks eat planes out of the sky, like, that sounds awesome.

943
01:06:29,221 --> 01:06:30,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the movie was awful.

944
01:06:30,962 --> 01:06:31,122
[SPEAKER_05]: But...

945
01:06:32,264 --> 01:06:33,145
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

946
01:06:51,981 --> 01:06:54,843
[SPEAKER_05]: and you destroy things and Debra Gibson does a voice.

947
01:06:55,043 --> 01:06:56,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't you want to buy that game?

948
01:06:56,484 --> 01:06:57,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck yes!

949
01:06:57,524 --> 01:06:57,825
[SPEAKER_04]: See?

950
01:06:58,205 --> 01:07:02,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, okay, they put out the Jaws game, which granted was awesome because you can maybe- Fuck Jaws!

951
01:07:03,208 --> 01:07:06,109
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking- Did Jaws eat a plane out of the sky?

952
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:06,850
[SPEAKER_04]: It could've.

953
01:07:06,870 --> 01:07:08,491
[SPEAKER_05]: No, he chased around Richard Dreyfuss.

954
01:07:08,551 --> 01:07:09,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Boo hoo.

955
01:07:09,451 --> 01:07:09,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Landshark.

956
01:07:10,032 --> 01:07:11,593
[SPEAKER_05]: The guy's got one foot in the grave.

957
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:12,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.

958
01:07:15,435 --> 01:07:16,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Did it have Debra Gibson?

959
01:07:16,736 --> 01:07:17,456
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so.

960
01:07:19,777 --> 01:07:20,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Chatroom, am I crazy?

961
01:07:21,949 --> 01:07:22,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we knew that.

962
01:07:23,809 --> 01:07:25,110
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I mean for real about this.

963
01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:27,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Chat, would you or would you not want to play that game?

964
01:07:27,830 --> 01:07:31,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft in chat says, President Cat vs. Flying Shark Octopus.

965
01:07:32,892 --> 01:07:33,352
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

966
01:07:33,792 --> 01:07:36,373
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTetsuya says, Screw President Cat, I want that game.

967
01:07:36,673 --> 01:07:40,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, I am all about these lol what the fuck random games.

968
01:07:40,594 --> 01:07:42,834
[SPEAKER_05]: You ought to know that by now, listening to this show.

969
01:07:42,894 --> 01:07:44,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless this is your first time listening.

970
01:07:44,435 --> 01:07:45,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Which again, I apologize.

971
01:07:47,045 --> 01:07:47,385
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that?

972
01:07:47,405 --> 01:07:48,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that something someone linked to?

973
01:07:48,466 --> 01:07:52,608
[SPEAKER_11]: Uncovering the secrets of Mega Shark, Death in the Skies.

974
01:07:52,689 --> 01:08:03,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on, SSJ, I hate to do this in the middle of the show, but SSJ100Matt is linking us to this YouTube, and just knowing SSJ100Matt, I think this is important.

975
01:08:03,055 --> 01:08:03,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy shit!

976
01:08:15,872 --> 01:08:18,955
[SPEAKER_05]: The shark is eating the plane.

977
01:08:20,897 --> 01:08:22,819
[SPEAKER_05]: That needs to be on the end and the birds fly away.

978
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:24,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is that not on the Wii?

979
01:08:25,102 --> 01:08:28,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is that not being optioned for a video game?

980
01:08:28,705 --> 01:08:31,408
[SPEAKER_05]: That was 50 kinds of awesome.

981
01:08:32,889 --> 01:08:33,930
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so awful.

982
01:08:34,151 --> 01:08:35,932
[SPEAKER_04]: You're only encouraging these people.

983
01:08:37,932 --> 01:08:39,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Video games are kind of stupid.

984
01:08:39,673 --> 01:08:40,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, welcome.

985
01:08:42,014 --> 01:08:46,597
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I realize there are some video games out there with deep plots and all this stuff, but come on.

986
01:08:47,417 --> 01:08:48,738
[SPEAKER_05]: That just screams America.

987
01:08:48,818 --> 01:08:49,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck yeah.

988
01:08:49,598 --> 01:08:50,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Sharks eating planes.

989
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:55,001
[SPEAKER_11]: I just like this scene.

990
01:08:55,021 --> 01:08:55,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude looks out the window.

991
01:08:55,981 --> 01:08:56,582
[SPEAKER_11]: Shark!

992
01:08:57,082 --> 01:09:04,466
[SPEAKER_04]: I assure you that watching the two seconds of that aren't necessarily as good as watching a full 90-minute movie.

993
01:09:06,798 --> 01:09:11,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Imagine you're sitting down with a Nintendo Wii and then all of a sudden... Holy shit!

994
01:09:16,964 --> 01:09:18,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would a shark attack a plane?

995
01:09:19,266 --> 01:09:20,226
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes no sense.

996
01:09:21,187 --> 01:09:28,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do fighting characters decide to fight to the death and throw fireballs at each other and do spinning bird kicks and all the other bullshit?

997
01:09:28,871 --> 01:09:29,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on!

998
01:09:29,972 --> 01:09:31,013
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a video game.

999
01:09:31,293 --> 01:09:32,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Sharks can eat planes.

1000
01:09:33,274 --> 01:09:34,455
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, that should be in Street Fighter V.

1001
01:09:36,826 --> 01:09:38,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it could be in Civilization 5.

1002
01:09:38,607 --> 01:09:40,088
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, there is a Civilization 5.

1003
01:09:40,188 --> 01:09:41,289
[SPEAKER_05]: How'd you like that transition?

1004
01:09:41,549 --> 01:09:43,370
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a Civilization 5 announced.

1005
01:09:43,631 --> 01:09:44,731
[SPEAKER_05]: It is coming fall of 2010.

1006
01:09:45,372 --> 01:09:46,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, this made me squee.

1007
01:09:46,593 --> 01:09:47,933
[SPEAKER_05]: You know I love my Civilization.

1008
01:09:48,174 --> 01:09:51,416
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Civilization 1 is like my favorite PC game they've ever made.

1009
01:09:51,816 --> 01:09:58,020
[SPEAKER_05]: But good old Sid Meier and Civilization series, a fifth installment coming out from 2K Games this fall, 2010.

1010
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:04,124
[SPEAKER_05]: And I shouldn't be surprised at this news, although I have to admit this was news I kind of wasn't expecting.

1011
01:10:04,464 --> 01:10:06,126
[SPEAKER_05]: But then the news came out this week and I was like,

1012
01:10:06,906 --> 01:10:08,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck yeah, another Civilization!

1013
01:10:09,328 --> 01:10:09,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool!

1014
01:10:10,149 --> 01:10:11,711
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't expecting it, but cool.

1015
01:10:11,731 --> 01:10:13,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the fourth one was actually really good.

1016
01:10:13,092 --> 01:10:14,453
[SPEAKER_05]: It was probably my favorite next to the first one.

1017
01:10:14,774 --> 01:10:16,715
[SPEAKER_05]: But they are talking about it's going to be an all-new engine.

1018
01:10:16,735 --> 01:10:19,138
[SPEAKER_05]: The biggest change, the most shocking change, if you will.

1019
01:10:19,458 --> 01:10:22,701
[SPEAKER_05]: They have switched to hexagon tiles instead of square-based tiles.

1020
01:10:22,761 --> 01:10:23,762
[SPEAKER_05]: It's now going to be hexagon.

1021
01:10:23,782 --> 01:10:28,787
[SPEAKER_05]: So think Catan meets Civilization, or Catanalization, if you will, is what I'm calling this game.

1022
01:10:29,267 --> 01:10:29,808
[SPEAKER_05]: So there it is.

1023
01:10:31,609 --> 01:10:42,817
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to have, of course, the leaders will be all animated and the landscapes will be all nice and new combats, new diplomacy, and mods, mods, mods, because they are embracing of the mod community, which is very cool.

1024
01:10:42,897 --> 01:10:44,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't expect this to come out on consoles, though.

1025
01:10:45,239 --> 01:10:48,301
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just too much micromanaging in Civilization game.

1026
01:10:48,321 --> 01:10:49,803
[SPEAKER_05]: It really can't be done on a console.

1027
01:10:49,883 --> 01:10:56,868
[SPEAKER_05]: But, of course, there is Civ Revolution, which took some flack from Civ fans because it kind of dumbed down the series, if you will.

1028
01:10:57,628 --> 01:11:00,629
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you what, I think Civ Revolution is a great introduction to the series.

1029
01:11:00,769 --> 01:11:02,969
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was an overlooked game on consoles.

1030
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:03,870
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was a lot of fun.

1031
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:12,091
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it compares to the PC versions, but I think if you're just not much of a PC gamer or want a game that is low-key on your console, go for it.

1032
01:11:12,151 --> 01:11:13,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Civ Network's pretty cool.

1033
01:11:14,712 --> 01:11:19,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm looking forward to Civilization V. Gonna get your Civ on?

1034
01:11:20,813 --> 01:11:24,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, I might have to actually put down WoW to try this out for a little while.

1035
01:11:25,236 --> 01:11:26,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Alan, I know you play some PC games.

1036
01:11:26,938 --> 01:11:29,680
[SPEAKER_05]: You play a pretty big mix of PC and console games, right?

1037
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:30,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

1038
01:11:30,281 --> 01:11:31,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you play Civilization at all?

1039
01:11:32,382 --> 01:11:32,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really.

1040
01:11:33,123 --> 01:11:34,004
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if this is going to work.

1041
01:11:34,204 --> 01:11:39,889
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but seriously though, you play a lot of shooter type games, right?

1042
01:11:39,909 --> 01:11:41,390
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of PC games are you into?

1043
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:59,377
[SPEAKER_12]: lots of first person shooters love Bioshock and Half-Life as far as Civ, a game like Civ I was really into Rise of Nations which was sort of a Civ clone that came out by Big Huge Games under Microsoft's Game Studios label so yeah, I played that very cool

1044
01:12:01,092 --> 01:12:10,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, before we get to the classic game of the week, I was sent another YouTube from SSJ100Matt in private.

1045
01:12:10,554 --> 01:12:11,394
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to watch this.

1046
01:12:12,594 --> 01:12:15,255
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the shark.

1047
01:12:15,295 --> 01:12:20,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, eats the Golden Gate Bridge just like that.

1048
01:12:24,556 --> 01:12:25,897
[SPEAKER_05]: During midday commute too.

1049
01:12:26,237 --> 01:12:27,337
[SPEAKER_05]: How rude of that shark.

1050
01:12:30,692 --> 01:12:31,733
[SPEAKER_05]: If that was in a video game?

1051
01:12:32,914 --> 01:12:34,195
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't play as the fucking shark.

1052
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:36,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

1053
01:12:36,757 --> 01:12:38,559
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why Jaws didn't sell, Loki.

1054
01:12:38,819 --> 01:12:40,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Can Jaws eat the Golden Gate Bridge?

1055
01:12:41,001 --> 01:12:41,221
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1056
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:16,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I do my bit, Rob?

1057
01:13:16,342 --> 01:13:17,903
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess you can do your bit.

1058
01:13:18,203 --> 01:13:22,086
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been very patient and suffering through an hour and a half of OLR tonight.

1059
01:13:22,727 --> 01:13:25,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it's only an hour and 15 minutes, but we were here in the studio for quite a bit beforehand.

1060
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:31,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Classic Game of the Week, etc., etc., goes into the vault, finds a game, blah, blah, blah, picks one for you, and it's great.

1061
01:13:31,815 --> 01:13:32,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah?

1062
01:13:32,635 --> 01:13:33,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes!

1063
01:13:34,837 --> 01:13:37,920
[SPEAKER_11]: Our Game of the Week is Shenmue!

1064
01:13:39,521 --> 01:13:40,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay!

1065
01:13:40,382 --> 01:13:42,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Why, yes, I would like to try a game of Lucky Hit.

1066
01:13:44,421 --> 01:13:50,923
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, all I found was, like, just the soundtrack stuff, because, really, I was getting tired of listening to Rio talk.

1067
01:13:52,643 --> 01:13:53,503
[SPEAKER_12]: Asking about sailors.

1068
01:13:54,003 --> 01:13:58,004
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, the sailors one, I was just, I had to go back and watch that.

1069
01:13:58,344 --> 01:13:59,905
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have sailors that come in here?

1070
01:14:00,405 --> 01:14:05,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, sometimes they come in at night, but they leave before it gets too late.

1071
01:14:06,586 --> 01:14:07,847
[SPEAKER_11]: The lady of most, yeah.

1072
01:14:08,427 --> 01:14:08,627
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

1073
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:14,491
[SPEAKER_11]: Shenmue is one of the masterpieces of Yu Suzuki.

1074
01:14:16,894 --> 01:14:23,179
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really meant for interactive and to be a free-form sort of environment.

1075
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:31,207
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, you have real-life aspects like you go to bed, you get up in the morning, you pee.

1076
01:14:31,347 --> 01:14:33,329
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I don't know, they clearly don't show I'm peeing.

1077
01:14:33,789 --> 01:14:39,820
[SPEAKER_11]: but you can also go to vending machines and arcades and you can like play classic games in the arcades which is awesome

1078
01:14:41,761 --> 01:14:47,365
[SPEAKER_11]: and he has a video game system in his house, has convenience stores.

1079
01:14:49,226 --> 01:14:51,788
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's really open as for what you could do.

1080
01:14:52,548 --> 01:15:07,579
[SPEAKER_11]: But with the characters in there, basically the overall story is that Ryo comes home and finds them beating up his dad and then he gets smacked around and then his dad tells him where to find something that he's looking for and the game goes from there.

1081
01:15:08,619 --> 01:15:08,840
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

1082
01:15:10,822 --> 01:15:16,026
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, so you go around and you actually are trying to track down this guy and trying to figure out what's going on.

1083
01:15:16,587 --> 01:15:22,692
[SPEAKER_11]: And you have to talk to all the people and you have to do rescues and you have to go against these other guys.

1084
01:15:22,752 --> 01:15:24,733
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a big investigation, you know.

1085
01:15:26,295 --> 01:15:28,156
[SPEAKER_11]: And you just play as this guy.

1086
01:15:29,077 --> 01:15:31,419
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can also raise kittens.

1087
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:32,940
[SPEAKER_11]: You can feed kittens.

1088
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:33,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, I'm sold.

1089
01:15:34,681 --> 01:15:35,462
[SPEAKER_11]: They're cute little kittens.

1090
01:15:38,084 --> 01:15:38,645
[SPEAKER_11]: But, um...

1091
01:15:40,370 --> 01:16:07,018
[SPEAKER_11]: The game was... There were little quick time events that were in the game too where you would witness something and you would have to hit the right button at the right time and that's how a lot of the fighting went too and then it would go along with a cutscene and you had your little questing areas and you had your different battles and Ryo could fight because his dad ran a dojo and of course he was going to teach his kid.

1092
01:16:08,399 --> 01:16:12,646
[SPEAKER_11]: The cool thing about this, though, is that it was supposed to be a killer app for the Saturn.

1093
01:16:14,309 --> 01:16:15,350
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the big thing about it.

1094
01:16:16,432 --> 01:16:20,639
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, you can actually find online...

1095
01:16:23,439 --> 01:16:27,041
[SPEAKER_11]: A video of the Saturn version.

1096
01:16:27,061 --> 01:16:29,923
[SPEAKER_11]: It was pretty sweet for Saturn at the time.

1097
01:16:31,624 --> 01:16:33,786
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was going to try to revive the Saturn.

1098
01:16:34,206 --> 01:16:40,510
[SPEAKER_11]: But since the Dreamcast was coming out, they actually started working on Shenmue.

1099
01:16:40,650 --> 01:16:42,631
[SPEAKER_11]: At the time it was Katana, remember?

1100
01:16:43,332 --> 01:16:45,253
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, I remember that, yeah.

1101
01:16:45,413 --> 01:16:45,633
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1102
01:16:46,694 --> 01:16:49,455
[SPEAKER_11]: And then what was being worked on was called Project Berkeley.

1103
01:16:50,656 --> 01:16:52,537
[SPEAKER_11]: So there were tech demos out under that name.

1104
01:16:53,277 --> 01:16:57,399
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it went into actual production for Dreamcast.

1105
01:16:57,740 --> 01:17:05,344
[SPEAKER_11]: And every character that you run into in the game has... They had voice actors for.

1106
01:17:05,884 --> 01:17:09,286
[SPEAKER_11]: In Japanese and English, a full orchestrated soundtrack.

1107
01:17:10,406 --> 01:17:10,546
[SPEAKER_11]: And...

1108
01:17:11,887 --> 01:17:15,592
[SPEAKER_05]: At that time, that level of voice acting was kind of unheard of too.

1109
01:17:15,752 --> 01:17:17,154
[SPEAKER_05]: That was pretty awesome, I gotta say.

1110
01:17:17,414 --> 01:17:21,219
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it had a weather system in the game called the Magic Weather System.

1111
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:22,340
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

1112
01:17:23,997 --> 01:17:39,825
[SPEAKER_11]: So when you go through the game, you have different, you know, things that are happening, but they actually were meant to reflect the actual weather conditions of Yokosuka at the time, which is where he lived in Japan.

1113
01:17:40,726 --> 01:17:44,428
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was set in the 1986-1987.

1114
01:17:44,708 --> 01:17:46,629
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can actually go and explore different parts of town, too.

1115
01:17:46,649 --> 01:17:47,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember the 80s?

1116
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:51,272
[SPEAKER_05]: So this could have been happening concurrently with Karate Kid 2.

1117
01:17:51,973 --> 01:17:52,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1118
01:17:52,433 --> 01:17:52,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1119
01:17:53,654 --> 01:18:00,579
[SPEAKER_11]: But I mean, you know, it's meant to be, you know, what Japan was like in the 80s in a little small town.

1120
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:05,262
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, in the Japanese version you had Coca-Cola stuff everywhere.

1121
01:18:05,543 --> 01:18:12,568
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is funny, since Pepsi's, Pepsi Japan, their big thing was with, Sega's big thing was with Pepsi.

1122
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:14,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember they had Pepsi Man?

1123
01:18:14,049 --> 01:18:14,129
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1124
01:18:15,296 --> 01:18:21,097
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember in the Crazy Taxi games, you were going to all the Pepsi brand restaurants.

1125
01:18:21,557 --> 01:18:25,618
[SPEAKER_11]: But they actually put out a couple of games in Japan that were Pepsi Man.

1126
01:18:26,899 --> 01:18:28,139
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember that, yeah.

1127
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:30,639
[SPEAKER_11]: You could actually go on YouTube and look up little commercials of Pepsi Man.

1128
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:32,420
[SPEAKER_11]: So, anyway.

1129
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:36,261
[SPEAKER_11]: So I thought it was funny that they had Coca-Cola for that one everywhere.

1130
01:18:36,401 --> 01:18:37,021
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know, and...

1131
01:18:39,152 --> 01:18:49,063
[SPEAKER_11]: It was, you know, also with, they were trying to show exactly what, you know, people were like in that days, like the younger generation was going more towards a western look for things.

1132
01:18:49,684 --> 01:18:54,208
[SPEAKER_11]: So you had your older generation in one style and your younger generation in a different style.

1133
01:18:55,349 --> 01:19:04,133
[SPEAKER_11]: And you also had a passport disc that you could go in and view the cutscenes for the movies.

1134
01:19:04,153 --> 01:19:05,514
[SPEAKER_11]: You could listen to the music.

1135
01:19:05,954 --> 01:19:09,996
[SPEAKER_11]: You had information so you could learn about other things going on in the game and the characters.

1136
01:19:10,056 --> 01:19:11,977
[SPEAKER_11]: You had the mini-games you could replay.

1137
01:19:13,298 --> 01:19:14,459
[SPEAKER_11]: You had a free battle.

1138
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:17,742
[SPEAKER_11]: Just all kinds of interactive stuff.

1139
01:19:17,822 --> 01:19:23,927
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you could use the passport to get to Shenmue World through the Dreamcast internet.

1140
01:19:25,008 --> 01:19:30,993
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was just all kinds of... It had an online manual network ranking for all your things.

1141
01:19:31,634 --> 01:19:36,839
[SPEAKER_11]: You could play with... You had VMU icons for your cute little VMU.

1142
01:19:37,579 --> 01:19:57,077
[SPEAKER_11]: collectible items like the toy capsules which would be like ships from other games I had an OPA OPA your data review it was all kinds of stuff and you can also track everything that you've done in the game from how long you've played to how long you've done the mini games to how many soft drinks you've bought

1143
01:19:59,125 --> 01:20:28,014
[SPEAKER_11]: and it of course discontinued when they cancelled Dreamcast production and there was a sequel of course which was Shenmue 2 but because it didn't sell very well Shenmue or Shenmue 2 we didn't get any more story that was it and there's people still holding their breath for Shenmue 3 and I have a feeling that we might see it one day but I like breathing

1144
01:20:29,946 --> 01:20:38,032
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, they also did a figure that Dan showed me of Ryo driving a forklift.

1145
01:20:38,933 --> 01:20:40,994
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also, he's in the Sega Racers game.

1146
01:20:41,014 --> 01:20:45,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, he is, and he's riding the motorbike, and he also rides the forklift.

1147
01:20:45,658 --> 01:20:50,742
[SPEAKER_11]: But you can actually buy a figure, a recent figure that came out of Ryo riding a forklift.

1148
01:20:52,743 --> 01:20:53,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I admit something?

1149
01:20:53,864 --> 01:20:54,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Go for it.

1150
01:20:54,224 --> 01:20:55,005
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never played this game.

1151
01:20:57,028 --> 01:21:03,510
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard about how fascinating it is I even had a Dreamcast but I just never really got around to playing this game Would you like to borrow my copy?

1152
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:05,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you like to play a game of Lucky Hit?

1153
01:21:06,150 --> 01:21:22,434
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I know There's some video where the dude just goes around asking everybody that and I kind of found it funny But I've always heard about its epic epicness You can play my copy if you want I don't even know if my Dreamcast is hooked up It's full of epic epicness like you just said

1154
01:21:22,614 --> 01:21:22,874
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1155
01:21:23,355 --> 01:21:25,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Shenmue, your classic game of the week.

1156
01:21:25,678 --> 01:21:26,279
[SPEAKER_05]: So there it is.

1157
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:26,960
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1158
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:35,030
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to take a break here at Orange Lounge Radio, but we've got plenty more to come tonight in Part B. We've got, of course, your phone calls and your Twitter topics if you haven't sent in any Twitter topics.

1159
01:21:35,070 --> 01:21:37,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead and get those in right now to at OLR on Twitter.

1160
01:21:38,835 --> 01:21:52,261
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to get to the rapid fire news as well and then get to some other stories including kind of a surprising new iPhone game as well as some of the dates and things for the upcoming Xbox Live block party and some news on Fable 3.

1161
01:21:52,301 --> 01:21:55,883
[SPEAKER_05]: We got all that coming up right after a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1162
01:22:02,609 --> 01:22:07,374
[SPEAKER_05]: And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday night, February the 21st of 2010.

1163
01:22:08,415 --> 01:22:11,378
[SPEAKER_05]: You are listening to that podcast where every gamer has a voice.

1164
01:22:11,978 --> 01:22:15,962
[SPEAKER_05]: And you might not know this, but we have an Olympic gold medal for being awesome.

1165
01:22:16,883 --> 01:22:19,806
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to talk about some more gaming news, of course, tonight.

1166
01:22:19,846 --> 01:22:21,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Join us if you're listening live at All Games Radio.

1167
01:22:22,128 --> 01:22:24,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to be.

1168
01:22:25,512 --> 01:22:35,283
[SPEAKER_05]: as you are listening live on this Sunday if you've never listened live before you really should join us sometime it's kind of a different show when you're listening live and as Alan is finding out tonight it's a really different show when you're sitting here in studio

1169
01:22:36,001 --> 01:22:36,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1170
01:22:36,121 --> 01:22:36,742
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's alright.

1171
01:22:36,922 --> 01:22:37,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm good.

1172
01:22:37,362 --> 01:22:37,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Cheers, thanks a lot.

1173
01:22:57,743 --> 01:23:15,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, there's a cool fan-made 8-bit-esque Mega Man first-person shooter game that someone's made called Mega Man 8-Bit Deathmatch and features some of the original Mega Man characters and their kind of 8-bit glory, kind of almost like a Doom mod, but I don't think it is.

1174
01:23:16,368 --> 01:23:35,095
[SPEAKER_04]: and yeah it's really sweet you can actually check it out on I believe it's cutstuff.net is where you can find that to download and apparently it's free at least they have a trailer of it and stuff I'm not sure when it's actually being released but it's pretty cool

1175
01:23:36,243 --> 01:23:37,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, anyways.

1176
01:23:38,825 --> 01:23:40,946
[SPEAKER_04]: So other things that are pretty cool.

1177
01:23:41,466 --> 01:23:47,090
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of stuff out there that are allowing you to buy a game and get something else for free.

1178
01:23:47,150 --> 01:23:54,355
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, last week we talked about how if you were one of the people that bought Darksiders, you would get a code for a free Red Faction game.

1179
01:23:54,815 --> 01:24:00,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you didn't happen to keep your mystery code with your copy of Darksiders, fear not.

1180
01:24:00,979 --> 01:24:02,040
[SPEAKER_04]: You can still redeem...

1181
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:11,724
[SPEAKER_04]: A free copy of Red Faction Guerrilla, assuming that you have a copy of your receipt and some other stuff that they want you to send them copies of.

1182
01:24:12,264 --> 01:24:16,366
[SPEAKER_04]: And with that, you'll get a free copy of Red Faction Guerrilla and a digital art book.

1183
01:24:17,506 --> 01:24:21,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, another kind of bonus THQ is handing out.

1184
01:24:21,968 --> 01:24:26,850
[SPEAKER_04]: With people that pre-ordered Dawn of War 2, the expansion to the Warhammer franchise...

1185
01:24:27,610 --> 01:24:46,103
[SPEAKER_04]: you will be able to get Saints Row 2 on PC for free which is pretty cool and then of course THQ isn't the only ones doing that for Battlefield Bad Company 2 on PC if you happen to pre-order your copy through the EA store you will net yourself a free copy of Battlefield 2142 as well

1186
01:24:49,454 --> 01:25:15,651
[SPEAKER_04]: and then finally if you happen not to play PC games and maybe bought a PSP Go during the last few weeks here you'll be able to redeem I guess a free copy of Assassin's Creed Bloodlines or LittleBigPlanet for PSP and to do this you have to redeem it between February 18th and March 21st

1187
01:25:17,132 --> 01:25:20,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, so that's like if you just buy a new PSP Go, you can get one of those games for free?

1188
01:25:20,474 --> 01:25:21,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, during this time.

1189
01:25:22,536 --> 01:25:25,218
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess they're trying to finally make it worth some of the money they're asking for it.

1190
01:25:25,898 --> 01:25:27,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so that's kind of cool.

1191
01:25:27,559 --> 01:25:34,824
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally, there was a contest that was being held for modders for Unreal Tournament 3.

1192
01:25:35,905 --> 01:25:40,428
[SPEAKER_04]: And Epic has released the winners of the Make Something Unreal contest.

1193
01:25:41,048 --> 01:25:44,711
[SPEAKER_04]: and several mod teams created a bunch of different mods for it.

1194
01:25:45,071 --> 01:25:47,913
[SPEAKER_04]: The winning mod was a game called The Hunted.

1195
01:25:48,314 --> 01:25:53,257
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a third-person survivor horror action game that kind of looked like a Wild West version of Left 4 Dead.

1196
01:25:53,918 --> 01:26:04,226
[SPEAKER_04]: As the winner of the contest, the team will receive $50,000 and a commercial license for the Unreal Engine, meaning the team can actually make an Unreal Engine title as a commercial product.

1197
01:26:05,386 --> 01:26:05,507
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

1198
01:26:07,148 --> 01:26:08,488
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be pretty awesome looking.

1199
01:26:09,489 --> 01:26:11,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I watched the trailer for this and it was sweet.

1200
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:13,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the other winners.

1201
01:26:13,812 --> 01:26:16,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Second place was The Ball from Toltec Studios.

1202
01:26:18,134 --> 01:26:20,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Third place, Angels Fall First by PlantStorm.

1203
01:26:22,076 --> 01:26:23,357
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's the PlantStorm team.

1204
01:26:23,377 --> 01:26:23,617
[SPEAKER_04]: They won $30,000.

1205
01:26:25,298 --> 01:26:26,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Fourth place, Prometheus.

1206
01:26:27,178 --> 01:26:30,319
[SPEAKER_04]: And also the Prometheus team, they won $20,000.

1207
01:26:30,859 --> 01:26:36,180
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looks like fifth place won $10,000 with Hazard, A Journey of Life.

1208
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:38,741
[SPEAKER_04]: And they had some other categories as well.

1209
01:26:38,801 --> 01:26:40,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of money being given away, though.

1210
01:26:42,121 --> 01:26:42,802
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

1211
01:26:43,722 --> 01:26:44,422
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

1212
01:26:44,862 --> 01:26:46,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully, we'll look forward to seeing that.

1213
01:26:48,223 --> 01:26:50,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well I have some quick topics for you guys here.

1214
01:26:50,423 --> 01:26:53,784
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of them has to do with a game that's unlikely to...

1215
01:26:55,904 --> 01:26:59,346
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not one you would think is as played as it is, but what does WoW have?

1216
01:26:59,386 --> 01:27:01,867
[SPEAKER_05]: World of Warcraft's got, what, 11, maybe 12 million players on it?

1217
01:27:03,008 --> 01:27:03,688
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's about right.

1218
01:27:03,768 --> 01:27:06,110
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Warcraft is probably one of the biggest MMOs with that many people.

1219
01:27:06,410 --> 01:27:10,553
[SPEAKER_05]: What if I told you there was a game with about seven times as many players on it playing right now?

1220
01:27:11,293 --> 01:27:12,354
[SPEAKER_05]: It's FarmVille.

1221
01:27:12,834 --> 01:27:13,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's right.

1222
01:27:13,354 --> 01:27:15,816
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a news story circulating game blogs this week.

1223
01:27:15,836 --> 01:27:16,496
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate that game.

1224
01:27:16,877 --> 01:27:20,819
[SPEAKER_05]: FarmVille has passed 80 million users yesterday.

1225
01:27:20,959 --> 01:27:22,100
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1226
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:53,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so FarmVille, of course, 80 million people playing FarmVille.

1227
01:27:53,401 --> 01:28:00,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, whether you love or hate FarmVille, it certainly goes to show that Facebook as a gaming platform should not be discounted.

1228
01:28:00,643 --> 01:28:02,143
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that is a huge amount of people.

1229
01:28:02,223 --> 01:28:06,344
[SPEAKER_05]: No word as to how many spam messages those 80 million people have sent their friends about.

1230
01:28:06,364 --> 01:28:10,565
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, sign up for this and get a million farm bucks or whatever it is.

1231
01:28:10,646 --> 01:28:11,006
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1232
01:28:11,126 --> 01:28:14,727
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can get a super cow to make lots of milk or whatever they do.

1233
01:28:14,747 --> 01:28:15,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Super cow.

1234
01:28:15,587 --> 01:28:16,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Super cow, whatever.

1235
01:28:16,907 --> 01:28:18,528
[SPEAKER_05]: I see all this bullshit all the time.

1236
01:28:18,829 --> 01:28:23,672
[SPEAKER_05]: I get all these group invites like, join me now in Farmville so I can get my honeycomb or whatever.

1237
01:28:23,692 --> 01:28:24,473
[SPEAKER_05]: I hit all of those.

1238
01:28:24,893 --> 01:28:25,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my gosh.

1239
01:28:25,493 --> 01:28:28,375
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I get like group invites to my email.

1240
01:28:28,415 --> 01:28:28,736
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, ugh.

1241
01:28:29,576 --> 01:28:31,197
[SPEAKER_05]: I just report them for abuse every time.

1242
01:28:33,737 --> 01:28:34,678
[SPEAKER_05]: I just get irritated.

1243
01:28:34,718 --> 01:28:38,022
[SPEAKER_05]: But see, yeah, I mean, Actdeft in chatroom brings up a good point.

1244
01:28:38,062 --> 01:28:40,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Bejeweled Blitz greater than Farmville.

1245
01:28:40,645 --> 01:28:43,408
[SPEAKER_05]: I will admit, I still play Bejeweled Blitz, like, a lot.

1246
01:28:43,468 --> 01:28:45,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, Alan, you watched me play the other day.

1247
01:28:45,130 --> 01:28:48,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I was like, oh, I gotta get my score in for the week because I want to get entered in for laptop.

1248
01:28:48,935 --> 01:28:52,199
[SPEAKER_02]: And, yeah, I have Bejeweled Blitz on my phone.

1249
01:28:53,070 --> 01:28:56,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Not more, I quit that too I've tried some of them

1250
01:29:21,007 --> 01:29:31,754
[SPEAKER_11]: and I tried FarmVille and I finally actually told people before they had the hide, you know, all things from this application to just stop including me on their little announcements.

1251
01:29:32,635 --> 01:29:36,017
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I would hunt down people and tell them, disinclude me.

1252
01:29:37,088 --> 01:29:37,929
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1253
01:29:53,585 --> 01:29:56,988
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, my favorite of those groups is still I Bet This Pickle Can Get More Fans Than Nickelback.

1254
01:29:59,190 --> 01:30:02,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't there one that's like I Bet This Mobius Strip Can Get More Fans Than Itself?

1255
01:30:05,054 --> 01:30:06,295
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw a group called that.

1256
01:30:06,855 --> 01:30:07,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Or there was another one.

1257
01:30:07,836 --> 01:30:08,357
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1258
01:30:08,397 --> 01:30:09,658
[SPEAKER_05]: There was one you joined this week.

1259
01:30:09,698 --> 01:30:11,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Or was that just a status update, Alan?

1260
01:30:11,319 --> 01:30:16,103
[SPEAKER_05]: You put like I Bet That X Can Get More Fans Than Y. I don't remember what it said.

1261
01:30:17,203 --> 01:30:20,106
[SPEAKER_12]: I Bet This Atvar Can Get More Fans Than Y.

1262
01:30:20,646 --> 01:30:22,607
[SPEAKER_12]: Pound Fu, like just variables.

1263
01:30:22,788 --> 01:30:23,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Programming joke?

1264
01:30:23,588 --> 01:30:23,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1265
01:30:23,868 --> 01:30:24,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

1266
01:30:24,709 --> 01:30:26,250
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a very high-level nerd joke.

1267
01:30:26,270 --> 01:30:28,211
[SPEAKER_05]: That might be too highbrow for this show, actually.

1268
01:30:28,511 --> 01:30:31,053
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to tone it down with some dick and fart jokes.

1269
01:30:31,774 --> 01:30:37,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hey, StarCraft II, hey, no better way to bring it to gaming than talk about StarCraft II.

1270
01:30:37,598 --> 01:30:45,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, as I'm sure you've heard many other places, the beta launched this week, and yeah, lots of people very eager to get in this game.

1271
01:30:45,743 --> 01:30:46,985
[SPEAKER_05]: How eager are they?

1272
01:30:47,445 --> 01:30:54,854
[SPEAKER_05]: So eager that they are paying up to $300 for StarCraft 2 beta keys to get into this game.

1273
01:30:54,934 --> 01:30:58,759
[SPEAKER_05]: This is some of the tickets that were handed out at BlizzCon 2008, apparently.

1274
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:00,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they are selling for $300.

1275
01:31:00,862 --> 01:31:01,663
[SPEAKER_05]: As high as $450 they've been spotted.

1276
01:31:01,683 --> 01:31:01,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

1277
01:31:05,547 --> 01:31:07,208
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, don't get me wrong.

1278
01:31:07,408 --> 01:31:11,310
[SPEAKER_05]: I think StarCraft 2 is going to be kind of cool, but not $450 cool.

1279
01:31:11,350 --> 01:31:13,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I can wait like a month for the finished product.

1280
01:31:13,211 --> 01:31:13,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Or not a month.

1281
01:31:13,832 --> 01:31:14,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Three months for the finished product.

1282
01:31:14,932 --> 01:31:15,773
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll wait six even.

1283
01:31:17,952 --> 01:31:20,595
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of good news at Blizzard Camp right now, though.

1284
01:31:20,675 --> 01:31:29,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Blizzard also this week has announced that their Pandaren campaign, that's right, they were selling in-game pets in World of Warcraft for $10 to fundraise money for the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

1285
01:31:29,884 --> 01:31:30,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I bought one.

1286
01:31:30,605 --> 01:31:30,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

1287
01:31:30,905 --> 01:31:31,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't judge me.

1288
01:31:31,706 --> 01:31:35,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I helped contribute to a cause that overall raised, they are announcing...

1289
01:31:35,810 --> 01:31:40,593
[SPEAKER_05]: 1.1 million dollars was raised by the Pandaren monks.

1290
01:31:41,234 --> 01:31:42,995
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was such a big donation.

1291
01:31:43,015 --> 01:31:49,940
[SPEAKER_05]: It was actually reported in the OC Register, which is a pretty big newspaper in Orange County, which you may know or not know.

1292
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:51,381
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where Blizzard is headquartered.

1293
01:31:52,081 --> 01:31:58,045
[SPEAKER_05]: What you also may not know about Orange County, I believe there is an art gallery there called the Orange Lounge.

1294
01:31:58,706 --> 01:32:05,110
[SPEAKER_05]: If you Google Orange Lounge, I don't know if you put Orange Lounge right here, just like Orange Lounge, you get that in your results.

1295
01:32:05,530 --> 01:32:08,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kind of a LOL what type of moment.

1296
01:32:08,813 --> 01:32:15,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, the Pandora Monks are still on sale, but you should know they are no longer going towards the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

1297
01:32:15,999 --> 01:32:17,801
[SPEAKER_05]: That was just a limited time thing.

1298
01:32:18,762 --> 01:32:22,025
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, if you look up Dark Sakura on Google, you can get my DeviantArt page.

1299
01:32:22,125 --> 01:32:22,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you really?

1300
01:32:22,725 --> 01:32:23,105
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you do.

1301
01:32:23,266 --> 01:32:23,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1302
01:32:24,736 --> 01:32:25,556
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1303
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:54,484
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I do.

1304
01:32:54,564 --> 01:32:55,845
[SPEAKER_11]: And by the way, I found the Orange Lounge.

1305
01:32:57,285 --> 01:32:57,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

1306
01:32:57,745 --> 01:33:12,870
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, yeah, with the stuff I have, we've got rock band releases coming from Hymn, One Night Only, The Police, and Marilyn Manson.

1307
01:33:14,051 --> 01:33:19,152
[SPEAKER_11]: So the Hymn Pack is Heart Killer, Ode to Solitude, Wings of a Butterfly, which I don't give a shit about.

1308
01:33:19,912 --> 01:33:20,753
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we have...

1309
01:33:22,474 --> 01:33:28,239
[SPEAKER_11]: KSM, Distracted, Marilyn Manson, The Dope Show, One Night Only, Just for Tonight, and Please, Walking on the Moon.

1310
01:33:28,899 --> 01:33:30,321
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're also available for Lego Rock Band.

1311
01:33:31,201 --> 01:33:32,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we have...

1312
01:33:35,054 --> 01:33:38,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, David Coverdale's kind of funny.

1313
01:33:39,857 --> 01:33:46,721
[SPEAKER_11]: He's not sure if there's going to be any Whitesnake songs coming on to any of the music games.

1314
01:33:47,481 --> 01:33:50,183
[SPEAKER_11]: The only one that I care about is Here I Go Again.

1315
01:33:50,743 --> 01:33:52,524
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, I mean, I'm sorry, that song's just awesome.

1316
01:33:54,525 --> 01:34:01,109
[SPEAKER_11]: And then Axis is bringing back the Kunio-kun series.

1317
01:34:02,009 --> 01:34:02,190
[SPEAKER_11]: We...

1318
01:34:04,488 --> 01:34:05,289
[SPEAKER_11]: River City Dodgeball

1319
01:34:28,507 --> 01:34:30,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep, Super Dodgeball Brawlers.

1320
01:34:30,148 --> 01:34:30,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet.

1321
01:34:31,409 --> 01:34:31,870
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's it.

1322
01:34:32,891 --> 01:34:33,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1323
01:34:33,611 --> 01:34:35,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into some Twitter topics, folks.

1324
01:34:35,913 --> 01:34:40,877
[SPEAKER_05]: We always invite your Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR and we're going to read some of your tweets.

1325
01:34:41,417 --> 01:34:42,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Show us your tweets.

1326
01:34:43,942 --> 01:34:44,903
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1327
01:35:03,863 --> 01:35:07,644
[SPEAKER_05]: for parts of like West Sacramento-ish.

1328
01:35:07,964 --> 01:35:09,725
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're really popular, but not a lot here.

1329
01:35:10,325 --> 01:35:13,425
[SPEAKER_05]: And U-verse, I don't think really exists here.

1330
01:35:13,606 --> 01:35:14,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we don't have U-verse.

1331
01:35:14,966 --> 01:35:21,608
[SPEAKER_05]: I looked up all of those for my new apartment because I wanted to competitively price and see who could give me the best deal, but Comcast was my only option.

1332
01:35:23,388 --> 01:35:25,571
[SPEAKER_05]: But it looks like the internet's running fine now, so whatever.

1333
01:35:27,294 --> 01:35:27,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1334
01:35:29,336 --> 01:35:35,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Got a message from Alpha Cananogram that's pointing us to this news story on Joystick.

1335
01:35:35,705 --> 01:35:40,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to make sure this isn't coming up later in the show because I didn't familiarize myself very well with the show world tonight.

1336
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:41,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-oh.

1337
01:36:06,926 --> 01:36:10,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the personal reason is I gotta get off this sinking ship quick.

1338
01:36:11,188 --> 01:36:12,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully things are able to turn around there.

1339
01:36:13,369 --> 01:36:17,692
[SPEAKER_05]: And also another tweet to us from Actdeft saying, can someone buy me this please?

1340
01:36:18,072 --> 01:36:22,314
[SPEAKER_05]: And he links us to a story on Kotaku that talks about pre-ordering the Final Fantasy XIII soundtrack.

1341
01:36:22,334 --> 01:36:22,834
[SPEAKER_05]: 85 tracks on 4 CDs.

1342
01:36:27,016 --> 01:36:29,077
[SPEAKER_05]: You can also get that on the North American Squeenix store.

1343
01:36:29,157 --> 01:36:33,799
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure it's going to be available through iTunes as well, but what a nice little collector's edition that would make.

1344
01:36:34,299 --> 01:36:35,420
[SPEAKER_05]: So, there you go.

1345
01:36:37,021 --> 01:36:37,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

1346
01:36:38,841 --> 01:36:41,583
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, I haven't really heard a lot of the music from Final Fantasy XIII yet.

1347
01:36:41,603 --> 01:36:44,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Just the Leona Lewis song, but that's because that's on her CD.

1348
01:36:44,844 --> 01:36:47,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, so you can hear the little clip on iTunes.

1349
01:36:47,165 --> 01:36:49,566
[SPEAKER_05]: So I haven't really heard the actual music music from the game yet.

1350
01:36:50,507 --> 01:36:51,167
[SPEAKER_05]: But I did see...

1351
01:36:52,007 --> 01:37:17,895
[SPEAKER_12]: of all places i saw on oh no they didn't this week which if you've never heard of oh no they didn't alan help me describe oh no they didn't you've been a member longer than i have how would you describe it it's the largest community on live journal it's so it's so large that during um major news events it'll actually crash the site for one community that's totally non-profit they don't make any um money off of it but it's just celebrity gossip and media news so it's just you know celeb lols basically yeah

1352
01:37:18,495 --> 01:37:22,117
[SPEAKER_05]: And lots of great... Animated GIFs are the whole reason to be on Oh No They Didn't.

1353
01:37:22,157 --> 01:37:24,558
[SPEAKER_05]: You find the best animated GIFs you're going to find anywhere on the internet there.

1354
01:37:24,958 --> 01:37:32,682
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, Oh No They Didn't had a story about... Somebody posted the actual video on YouTube of Leona Lewis playing Final Fantasy XIII.

1355
01:37:33,423 --> 01:37:36,064
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was kind of awkward to look at.

1356
01:37:36,244 --> 01:37:40,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, she's really cute and everything, but her lines sounded really fed.

1357
01:37:40,766 --> 01:37:45,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me see if I can find that video really quick before we get to the next news story here.

1358
01:37:46,209 --> 01:37:53,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I'll have Loki do a news story real quick while I try to find the video, and then I'll come back to this, because you've got to hear this, because I don't know.

1359
01:37:54,475 --> 01:38:02,381
[SPEAKER_05]: As precious as Leona Lewis is, I can't really think of a good adjective to describe Leona Lewis, but precious seems to be one.

1360
01:38:03,362 --> 01:38:05,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Her lines sound really forced, so I've got to try this.

1361
01:38:07,325 --> 01:38:09,667
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, AkumaJP in chat is saying, quite good.

1362
01:38:09,967 --> 01:38:11,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently the music is quite good.

1363
01:38:11,388 --> 01:38:13,090
[SPEAKER_05]: So, chat.orangezonsradio.com

1364
01:38:15,213 --> 01:38:16,334
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1365
01:38:40,655 --> 01:38:47,078
[SPEAKER_04]: A week after that, March 10th, we'll have Scrap Metal, which is kind of a top-down racing game.

1366
01:38:47,259 --> 01:38:50,840
[SPEAKER_04]: No one will really care, though, because that's the same week as, I believe, Final Fantasy XIII.

1367
01:38:52,061 --> 01:38:55,603
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's also 1,200 Microsoft points, or $15.

1368
01:38:56,183 --> 01:39:05,848
[SPEAKER_04]: March 17th, there will be the Perfect Dark Xbox Live Arcade game coming out for $10, or 800 Microsoft points.

1369
01:39:07,509 --> 01:39:14,776
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally, of course, as expected, on March 24th, the Game Room Hub will be available for no charge.

1370
01:39:14,796 --> 01:39:22,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, the games will run on their 400 Microsoft points or $5 for a PC and Xbox 360 friendly version.

1371
01:39:22,524 --> 01:39:29,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if you want to license them for one system, 240 Microsoft points or 40 Microsoft points for a single play.

1372
01:39:31,129 --> 01:39:32,690
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so excited about Game Room, though.

1373
01:39:32,871 --> 01:39:33,791
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's going to be fun.

1374
01:39:34,232 --> 01:39:37,895
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope there'll be people that want to have competitions on the old school games with me.

1375
01:39:38,075 --> 01:39:43,360
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll buy some of them, but I'm definitely not buying all the games that I had.

1376
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:44,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, definitely.

1377
01:39:44,261 --> 01:39:44,381
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1378
01:39:44,641 --> 01:39:45,422
[SPEAKER_05]: And I refuse.

1379
01:39:45,502 --> 01:39:48,204
[SPEAKER_05]: I will not buy a game that was already out on Xbox Live.

1380
01:39:48,244 --> 01:39:50,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, I will ask this, because I don't see a story on this anywhere else.

1381
01:39:51,147 --> 01:39:52,368
[SPEAKER_05]: And I read this earlier this week.

1382
01:39:52,408 --> 01:39:56,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you hear about how apparently some of the Midway games have disappeared from Xbox Live completely?

1383
01:39:56,632 --> 01:39:56,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1384
01:39:57,332 --> 01:39:58,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Joust, and Smash TV.

1385
01:39:59,794 --> 01:40:01,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much anything that was connected to Midway.

1386
01:40:01,396 --> 01:40:02,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Gauntlet, they're gone.

1387
01:40:02,777 --> 01:40:03,618
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not on Xbox Live.

1388
01:40:03,658 --> 01:40:04,579
[SPEAKER_05]: You cannot buy them now.

1389
01:40:05,139 --> 01:40:14,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, they swear up and down, or at least on Major Nelson's blog, it swears nothing to do with Game Room, it's a licensing thing, and maybe that has to do with the Warner Brothers acquisition, but I don't know.

1390
01:40:14,927 --> 01:40:17,990
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of look at that and go, okay, uh-huh, sure.

1391
01:40:18,010 --> 01:40:20,032
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it has to do with Midway being gone.

1392
01:40:20,252 --> 01:40:24,916
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's what it is, because now... But seriously, if Joust shows up on Game Room, aren't you going to be like...

1393
01:40:26,334 --> 01:40:27,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, I gave a visual.

1394
01:40:28,555 --> 01:40:32,817
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to be... I don't think that's the reason why.

1395
01:40:33,257 --> 01:40:37,559
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, I can't imagine those games are really popular right now as far as purchases go.

1396
01:40:37,579 --> 01:40:38,800
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're classic.

1397
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:40,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Smash TV is a classic.

1398
01:40:40,901 --> 01:40:43,162
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that, but at the same time...

1399
01:40:44,901 --> 01:40:53,128
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess maybe they could be doing that, but I don't think it's going to matter because there's going to be Pac-Man and Namco games aren't going away on Xbox Live Arcade.

1400
01:40:53,468 --> 01:40:54,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Konami games, I know.

1401
01:40:54,529 --> 01:40:55,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Konami games.

1402
01:40:55,149 --> 01:40:55,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Frogger.

1403
01:40:55,630 --> 01:40:56,551
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll always have Frogger.

1404
01:40:57,471 --> 01:40:59,113
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't... Yeah, great.

1405
01:41:00,774 --> 01:41:10,642
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't doubt that... I don't think that's the reason why is that because they're putting them on that service, but we'll see.

1406
01:41:11,761 --> 01:41:18,346
[SPEAKER_05]: And a good question from Actdeft in our chatroom, Joust, then what will happen with those Xbox Live 12-month game codes?

1407
01:41:19,107 --> 01:41:22,229
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess they're screwed, or maybe you'll get the points instead.

1408
01:41:22,689 --> 01:41:32,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, first off, so you know, the Xbox Live 12-month game codes that come with free games and stuff, I think they switched out those games.

1409
01:41:32,196 --> 01:41:34,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they probably switched out Joust a long time ago.

1410
01:41:34,638 --> 01:41:35,999
[SPEAKER_04]: They do new versions all the time.

1411
01:41:36,239 --> 01:41:41,263
[SPEAKER_04]: And the same thing, you know, they may be off the marketplace, but those codes may still redeem it.

1412
01:41:41,623 --> 01:41:44,925
[SPEAKER_04]: and if you've already downloaded it and need to re-download it again, they're still up there.

1413
01:41:44,965 --> 01:41:46,046
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're on their servers.

1414
01:41:46,146 --> 01:41:48,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and your game doesn't stop working just because it's gone.

1415
01:41:49,028 --> 01:41:53,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so it may not matter that those game codes are in there.

1416
01:41:53,311 --> 01:41:55,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know how many of those freaking games I bought?

1417
01:41:55,632 --> 01:41:58,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I think what I want to do tomorrow is just go in when I have the internet again.

1418
01:41:59,154 --> 01:42:05,859
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go in and actually just play Joust and Smash TV and all those games you can't get anymore just to fill up my gamer card to go, I have them.

1419
01:42:10,136 --> 01:42:13,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's go back to something I was mentioning earlier.

1420
01:42:13,377 --> 01:42:16,399
[SPEAKER_05]: This video is only a minute 13, so I'm going to go ahead and play it in studio.

1421
01:42:16,799 --> 01:42:29,726
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Leona Lewis talking about Final Fantasy XIII, and this is on YouTube user Gamerspawn, although I'm guessing he probably just stole it from the official Squeenix YouTube, but this is just who I'm playing it from, so whatever.

1422
01:42:30,667 --> 01:42:32,868
[SPEAKER_05]: So here it is, Leona Lewis talking about Final Fantasy XIII.

1423
01:42:36,991 --> 01:42:38,075
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little, here we go.

1424
01:42:40,603 --> 01:42:41,445
[SPEAKER_00]: Really amazing.

1425
01:42:41,847 --> 01:42:42,910
[SPEAKER_00]: Graphics are insane.

1426
01:42:53,709 --> 01:42:57,010
[SPEAKER_05]: She just did this little, like, yes thing with her little hand, like a little fist.

1427
01:42:57,050 --> 01:43:02,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't know how many times I've been playing Final Fantasy where I went, yes, but that couldn't have looked any more forced.

1428
01:43:02,191 --> 01:43:03,252
[SPEAKER_05]: I just point out.

1429
01:43:03,612 --> 01:43:07,633
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to say, I have, though, thrown down my controller and gone, oh, for fuck's sake.

1430
01:43:07,913 --> 01:43:08,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

1431
01:43:08,813 --> 01:43:10,314
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I want to see Leona Lewis do.

1432
01:43:10,334 --> 01:43:13,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see her throw her controller out the window like, fucking monster.

1433
01:43:13,555 --> 01:43:14,475
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be funny.

1434
01:43:23,646 --> 01:43:24,307
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you want to bet?

1435
01:43:24,347 --> 01:43:29,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, she might be holding the controller, but somebody else off camera is holding the real controller and playing the game.

1436
01:43:31,395 --> 01:43:33,437
[SPEAKER_05]: So they can show her playing the game, quote, quote.

1437
01:43:35,039 --> 01:43:35,719
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.

1438
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:38,442
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to, like, run around the land all day.

1439
01:43:40,204 --> 01:43:40,985
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everyone.

1440
01:43:41,145 --> 01:43:45,250
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thrilled to be collaborating with Square Enix on such a groundbreaking game.

1441
01:43:45,751 --> 01:43:55,953
[SPEAKER_00]: I never would have imagined my hands as such a perfect fit for Final Fantasy XIII, but the strong female protagonist struck a chord with me, and I can't wait to see Lightning do her thing.

1442
01:43:55,973 --> 01:44:06,615
[SPEAKER_00]: In anticipation of the much-awaited launch of Final Fantasy XIII, and on behalf of Square Enix, please join us in celebration of the launch of Final Fantasy XIII on March 9th.

1443
01:44:07,655 --> 01:44:10,875
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like I can see her eyes reading off the cue card.

1444
01:44:11,075 --> 01:44:13,716
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, no one says protagonist, you know.

1445
01:44:14,461 --> 01:44:15,803
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanna run around the field!

1446
01:44:16,844 --> 01:44:17,986
[SPEAKER_04]: I see something sparkly!

1447
01:44:29,654 --> 01:44:32,296
[SPEAKER_11]: In defense of that... Ah, Butterfly!

1448
01:44:32,556 --> 01:44:33,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god!

1449
01:44:33,357 --> 01:44:38,880
[SPEAKER_11]: In defense of the running around all day thing, I have been doing a lot of that in Star Trek Online just to see, oh, I wonder if this planet's here.

1450
01:44:38,940 --> 01:44:40,001
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I wonder if this planet's here.

1451
01:44:40,021 --> 01:44:40,962
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's an MMO.

1452
01:44:41,942 --> 01:44:47,486
[SPEAKER_05]: The funny thing is, Final Fantasy XIII's kind of been getting a little slack for how linear it is.

1453
01:44:47,746 --> 01:44:54,851
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard it's kind of like, you don't have towns and the dungeons are not... It's a little more linear, although I've heard good things about the game.

1454
01:44:54,891 --> 01:44:55,972
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a little different.

1455
01:44:56,032 --> 01:44:58,774
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just funny to hear her say, I could just run around all day.

1456
01:44:59,754 --> 01:45:00,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Do that.

1457
01:45:00,335 --> 01:45:02,498
[SPEAKER_11]: I can just run around all day because that's all I know how to do.

1458
01:45:02,518 --> 01:45:10,750
[SPEAKER_04]: I can run around all day long and annoy the fuck out of my significant other who's watching me play this game and go, What the fuck are you doing, woman?! !

1459
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:42,030
[SPEAKER_11]: I was gonna say it's the only way really one of her singles is gonna sell 2 million copies here is that she attaches it to that video game well no because then all the stuck up people are gonna be like oh well the Japanese version's better cause you know everything you know who actually had I think to this date had the best Final Fantasy song ever and that's Angela Aki I'm sorry that hers was such a crap game but Kiss Me Goodbye was a great song and

1460
01:45:42,350 --> 01:45:43,292
[SPEAKER_11]: and it launched her career.

1461
01:45:44,054 --> 01:45:45,116
[SPEAKER_05]: That was 9, right?

1462
01:45:45,597 --> 01:45:45,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1463
01:45:46,178 --> 01:45:48,022
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think 9 was a crap game.

1464
01:45:48,062 --> 01:45:49,285
[SPEAKER_05]: It was one of the better PlayStation.

1465
01:45:49,586 --> 01:45:50,087
[SPEAKER_05]: It was better than 8.

1466
01:45:51,969 --> 01:46:02,159
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing about 9 is it just kind of like, if I remember right, you know, this is many years ago, but if I remember right, 9 just kind of showed up, like, just out of nowhere, like, hey, Final Fantasy 9's out.

1467
01:46:02,239 --> 01:46:03,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, oh, wow.

1468
01:46:03,160 --> 01:46:06,803
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it was like, hey, fanservice, fanservice, and then, hey, the PS2's out now.

1469
01:46:07,304 --> 01:46:09,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it was kind of the same thing that happened with Final Fantasy 12.

1470
01:46:09,926 --> 01:46:12,388
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, hey, here's Final Fantasy 12 finally.

1471
01:46:12,609 --> 01:46:14,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, but the Xbox 360 and PS3 are out now.

1472
01:46:14,711 --> 01:46:14,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Darn.

1473
01:46:15,231 --> 01:46:22,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I meant, and I'm not saying it was a bad game, I'm not saying, a crap game was more like, I lost interest in it.

1474
01:46:23,378 --> 01:46:26,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I got to the, I got on the airship and I was done.

1475
01:46:27,362 --> 01:46:28,603
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, when you first escape.

1476
01:46:29,684 --> 01:46:31,386
[SPEAKER_11]: But, it had the best song.

1477
01:46:32,798 --> 01:46:37,160
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom saying looking at the video she is using the player one controller.

1478
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:38,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but see if they're smart.

1479
01:46:38,921 --> 01:46:43,723
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're really smart they have another system that it's synced to and then they have the other controller synced to the other one.

1480
01:46:44,343 --> 01:46:45,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1481
01:46:45,264 --> 01:46:46,084
[SPEAKER_04]: They thought ahead, huh?

1482
01:46:46,104 --> 01:46:46,745
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, come on.

1483
01:46:46,965 --> 01:46:47,865
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I would do it.

1484
01:46:47,945 --> 01:46:49,706
[SPEAKER_11]: An idiot could play a Final Fantasy game.

1485
01:46:50,353 --> 01:46:55,437
[SPEAKER_04]: And after all, she did say that she liked running around the field, so maybe they just put her down.

1486
01:46:55,457 --> 01:46:57,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, she was just running around the field.

1487
01:46:58,239 --> 01:46:59,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, look, I like Leona Lewis.

1488
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:00,300
[SPEAKER_05]: She's precious.

1489
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:03,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are these animals attacking me while I'm running around the field?

1490
01:47:04,123 --> 01:47:05,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are we picking on Leona Lewis?

1491
01:47:05,464 --> 01:47:06,185
[SPEAKER_05]: She's defenseless.

1492
01:47:06,965 --> 01:47:09,988
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like we're kicking Bambi, like making fun of Leona Lewis.

1493
01:47:10,168 --> 01:47:12,750
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not making fun of Leona Lewis, we're making fun of how forced that video was.

1494
01:47:16,212 --> 01:47:18,234
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't mind the Final Fantasy XIII song.

1495
01:47:18,374 --> 01:47:25,338
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the trailer is kind of weird with all the stuff blowing up and it's like, My hands!

1496
01:47:25,378 --> 01:47:27,540
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like explosions and motorcycles.

1497
01:47:28,401 --> 01:47:29,481
[SPEAKER_05]: My hands!

1498
01:47:29,701 --> 01:47:32,583
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like, it doesn't really fit.

1499
01:47:32,784 --> 01:47:36,046
[SPEAKER_04]: I can put that song then as my battle music in Final Fantasy XIV.

1500
01:47:36,146 --> 01:47:37,907
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1501
01:47:40,149 --> 01:47:41,570
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're attacking a level 75 bunny.

1502
01:47:44,691 --> 01:47:45,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Crushing your neck.

1503
01:47:46,553 --> 01:47:47,654
My hands.

1504
01:47:47,914 --> 01:47:48,895
[SPEAKER_14]: Ripping your head off.

1505
01:47:53,378 --> 01:47:54,880
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like doing falsetto on the show.

1506
01:47:54,940 --> 01:47:58,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, let's talk about iTunes and the iPhone.

1507
01:47:58,983 --> 01:48:04,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, of course, the iPhone, whether Loki likes it or not, is another gaming platform.

1508
01:48:04,207 --> 01:48:04,908
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently...

1509
01:48:07,651 --> 01:48:07,851
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1510
01:48:07,951 --> 01:48:08,272
[SPEAKER_11]: Never mind.

1511
01:48:08,632 --> 01:48:08,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

1512
01:48:09,212 --> 01:48:14,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently there's this game out on the iPhone that folks are getting a little crazy about.

1513
01:48:14,457 --> 01:48:17,059
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's Wobble Eyeboobs.

1514
01:48:17,940 --> 01:48:23,184
[SPEAKER_05]: This program got... Use your imagination, folks.

1515
01:48:23,564 --> 01:48:25,806
[SPEAKER_05]: $30,000 is how much this game made last year.

1516
01:48:26,126 --> 01:48:30,850
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was now being removed because people were complaining about the sexual content.

1517
01:48:31,551 --> 01:48:32,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently...

1518
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:36,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the rules that were given as to what is not supposed to be in your app.

1519
01:48:36,875 --> 01:48:38,496
[SPEAKER_05]: No images of women in bikinis.

1520
01:48:39,317 --> 01:48:40,678
[SPEAKER_05]: No images of men in bikinis.

1521
01:48:41,318 --> 01:48:42,199
[SPEAKER_05]: No skin.

1522
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:47,343
[SPEAKER_05]: No silhouettes that indicate that wobble can be used for wobbling boobs.

1523
01:48:48,183 --> 01:48:50,445
[SPEAKER_05]: No sexual connotations or innuendo.

1524
01:48:50,505 --> 01:48:52,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Boobs, babes, booty, sex.

1525
01:48:52,606 --> 01:48:54,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing that can be sexually arousing.

1526
01:48:54,848 --> 01:48:58,271
[SPEAKER_05]: And no apps will be approved that in any way imply sexual content.

1527
01:48:58,951 --> 01:49:05,716
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, the guy asked, since no skin is cited as the reason this app was pulled, he asked if a burqa was okay.

1528
01:49:05,956 --> 01:49:08,058
[SPEAKER_05]: But the Apple guy apparently got angry at that.

1529
01:49:11,621 --> 01:49:12,001
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1530
01:49:12,061 --> 01:49:14,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think Apple has a right to be removing these ads?

1531
01:49:14,903 --> 01:49:15,624
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gone.

1532
01:49:15,644 --> 01:49:15,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?

1533
01:49:16,144 --> 01:49:16,564
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gone.

1534
01:49:17,245 --> 01:49:17,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, it's gone.

1535
01:49:18,146 --> 01:49:20,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think Apple has a right to be taking this stuff down?

1536
01:49:20,267 --> 01:49:24,690
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they have a right, but I think at the same time they should offer this kind of content.

1537
01:49:24,851 --> 01:49:26,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, just maybe locked somehow.

1538
01:49:28,308 --> 01:49:30,009
[SPEAKER_05]: We can download a song called Boobs.

1539
01:49:30,589 --> 01:49:34,952
[SPEAKER_05]: And aren't there apps about farting and peeing and pooping and all this stuff?

1540
01:49:34,972 --> 01:49:35,392
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not nudity.

1541
01:49:36,013 --> 01:49:37,974
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure there's apps about blowing people up.

1542
01:49:39,235 --> 01:49:43,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, unless you're gonna go in your pants, pooping does involve nudity at some point.

1543
01:49:44,518 --> 01:49:48,541
[SPEAKER_04]: You can rip people's eyes out, but goddammit, if a boob shakes...

1544
01:49:50,259 --> 01:49:51,159
[SPEAKER_04]: It's over for you.

1545
01:50:12,208 --> 01:50:20,490
[SPEAKER_04]: So for example, in a game like God of War that has lots of bloody violence, there should be some really erotic game that they put out with no violence in it.

1546
01:50:21,511 --> 01:50:21,991
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only fair.

1547
01:50:22,191 --> 01:50:26,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Just make it prove that you're 18 in order to download the content.

1548
01:50:26,312 --> 01:50:27,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't it kind of already do that?

1549
01:50:27,572 --> 01:50:32,073
[SPEAKER_05]: I seem to remember downloading some content and it'll say, this might be objectionable.

1550
01:50:32,113 --> 01:50:37,815
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the keyboard cat app that I have, which will play keyboard cat at the touch of a button, it's amazing.

1551
01:50:38,535 --> 01:50:43,798
[SPEAKER_05]: actually says this might contain mature content and you have to be 17 or older to continue.

1552
01:50:44,678 --> 01:50:45,759
[SPEAKER_05]: It's keyboard cat.

1553
01:50:46,239 --> 01:50:49,541
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, but... I think that cats playing keyboard is offensive.

1554
01:50:51,922 --> 01:50:53,402
[SPEAKER_11]: It's cruelty to keyboards.

1555
01:50:54,323 --> 01:50:55,503
[SPEAKER_05]: What about dogs playing keyboards?

1556
01:50:55,783 --> 01:50:56,364
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't give a shit.

1557
01:50:57,324 --> 01:50:57,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Just curious.

1558
01:50:57,784 --> 01:50:58,645
[SPEAKER_04]: They should play the bassoon.

1559
01:51:00,678 --> 01:51:00,918
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1560
01:51:01,259 --> 01:51:02,720
[SPEAKER_04]: I just said the bassoon for some reason.

1561
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:03,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1562
01:51:03,901 --> 01:51:05,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did the bassoon come from?

1563
01:51:05,342 --> 01:51:07,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I mentioned the bassoon quartet earlier.

1564
01:51:07,604 --> 01:51:09,085
[SPEAKER_02]: You're in a bassoon mood.

1565
01:51:09,145 --> 01:51:10,006
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.

1566
01:51:10,346 --> 01:51:12,068
[SPEAKER_12]: Rolf the dog played keyboard before anyone.

1567
01:51:13,909 --> 01:51:14,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

1568
01:51:15,771 --> 01:51:17,032
[SPEAKER_11]: Freaking keyboard cat app.

1569
01:51:17,913 --> 01:51:18,853
[SPEAKER_11]: Now I have to download it.

1570
01:51:18,954 --> 01:51:20,395
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got to bring it back to Muppets.

1571
01:51:20,435 --> 01:51:22,857
[SPEAKER_12]: Rolf the dog is before keyboard cat.

1572
01:51:25,959 --> 01:51:26,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I do a story?

1573
01:51:26,860 --> 01:51:27,140
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1574
01:51:28,579 --> 01:51:34,381
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of iPhone and violence, um, yeah, Street Fighter 4 is going to be coming on the iPhone, and I'm like, why?

1575
01:51:35,122 --> 01:51:35,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

1576
01:51:35,922 --> 01:51:36,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

1577
01:51:37,182 --> 01:51:42,144
[SPEAKER_11]: So far, all we see is Ken and Ryu, um, nothing really in action.

1578
01:51:42,204 --> 01:51:44,865
[SPEAKER_11]: They look kind of, um, dinky and tiny.

1579
01:51:45,866 --> 01:51:51,408
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't aware that the iPhone had a big 3D processor in it or anything.

1580
01:51:52,408 --> 01:51:52,629
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

1581
01:51:54,109 --> 01:51:54,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever.

1582
01:51:55,190 --> 01:52:02,532
[SPEAKER_11]: But, in happier news for those of us who will play Super Street Fighter 4, we get some Street Fighter 3 characters.

1583
01:52:02,612 --> 01:52:10,815
[SPEAKER_11]: We get Ibuki, we get Makoto, and we get Dudley, as we mentioned in rumor of the week before.

1584
01:52:11,735 --> 01:52:13,076
[SPEAKER_11]: So, that's pretty cool.

1585
01:52:13,636 --> 01:52:16,297
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's also this cake box.

1586
01:52:16,317 --> 01:52:23,800
[SPEAKER_11]: I was looking at the Japanese... I'm sure you saw what my wallpaper was of Sakura, but it was the Super Street Fighter 4 website.

1587
01:52:24,260 --> 01:52:31,822
[SPEAKER_11]: There's also this Korean taekwondo fighter who's just vicious.

1588
01:52:32,663 --> 01:52:33,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely vicious.

1589
01:52:33,803 --> 01:52:37,024
[SPEAKER_11]: They show this character beating up Sagat, and they never show anyone beating up Sagat.

1590
01:52:37,084 --> 01:52:38,525
[SPEAKER_11]: So, pretty crazy.

1591
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:42,521
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't play a lot of Street Fighter 3, admittedly.

1592
01:52:42,641 --> 01:52:44,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Are these good characters to be bringing over?

1593
01:52:45,243 --> 01:52:47,764
[SPEAKER_11]: Ibuki was my staple for Street Fighter 3.

1594
01:52:48,864 --> 01:52:49,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Same.

1595
01:52:49,965 --> 01:52:50,905
[SPEAKER_11]: She's fast.

1596
01:52:51,145 --> 01:52:54,207
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, you know who I actually would have really liked to have seen was Elena.

1597
01:52:55,157 --> 01:52:56,298
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Elena was the one I used.

1598
01:52:56,318 --> 01:52:58,439
[SPEAKER_05]: She's the one that kind of did like capoeira type moves, right?

1599
01:52:58,479 --> 01:52:58,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1600
01:52:58,859 --> 01:52:59,879
[SPEAKER_05]: I used her when I played.

1601
01:52:59,899 --> 01:53:00,660
[SPEAKER_11]: She was all leg.

1602
01:53:01,260 --> 01:53:02,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, very cool.

1603
01:53:02,121 --> 01:53:04,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of like Eddie in Tekken 4, right?

1604
01:53:04,662 --> 01:53:05,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Or 3, 4, one of the two?

1605
01:53:05,302 --> 01:53:05,282
3.

1606
01:53:05,462 --> 01:53:05,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah.

1607
01:53:06,623 --> 01:53:08,204
[SPEAKER_11]: Because after that they got Christy.

1608
01:53:09,484 --> 01:53:11,385
[SPEAKER_05]: So Street Fighter 4 on the iPhone, huh?

1609
01:53:12,366 --> 01:53:14,186
[SPEAKER_05]: They're talking about pouring it to the PSP also.

1610
01:53:15,427 --> 01:53:19,609
[SPEAKER_11]: I can see the PSP better than I can see the buttons.

1611
01:53:20,229 --> 01:53:31,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the screen capture, this image that they had of it was like the joystick and everything was on the screen.

1612
01:53:31,995 --> 01:53:34,116
[SPEAKER_11]: So are you going to actually be able to see what you're doing?

1613
01:53:34,516 --> 01:53:34,776
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1614
01:53:37,038 --> 01:53:37,778
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a bad idea.

1615
01:53:38,178 --> 01:53:40,099
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to make money off of it, but it's a bad idea.

1616
01:53:40,839 --> 01:53:43,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know what I think about Street Fighter 4 coming to the iPhone?

1617
01:53:43,561 --> 01:53:43,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Your mom?

1618
01:53:52,740 --> 01:53:54,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, no, that's the Muppet Babies theme.

1619
01:53:54,441 --> 01:53:58,442
[SPEAKER_05]: I just had it stuck in my head ever since Alan mentioned Rolf.

1620
01:54:00,963 --> 01:54:02,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's jam to this a little bit.

1621
01:54:03,084 --> 01:54:06,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's going to be better than Street Fighter 4 on the iPhone, let's face it.

1622
01:54:17,418 --> 01:54:19,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, no, I don't care about Street Fighter 4 on the iPhone.

1623
01:54:19,499 --> 01:54:20,619
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to control like shit.

1624
01:54:20,799 --> 01:54:24,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Until Apple releases an actual joystick for the iPhone, who cares?

1625
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:26,560
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would download a Muppet Babies app.

1626
01:54:26,660 --> 01:54:26,940
[SPEAKER_04]: I would.

1627
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:30,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe you might be more interested in Fable 3.

1628
01:54:30,901 --> 01:54:33,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Fable 3, they're talking a little bit about the co-op in the game.

1629
01:54:34,562 --> 01:54:38,143
[SPEAKER_04]: And it sounds to me, even though they're claiming it's all new and stuff,

1630
01:54:38,983 --> 01:54:52,216
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds just like Fable 2 if you ask me, but according to an interview with Peter Molino during the 4Guys1UP podcast, they talked about the co-op system.

1631
01:54:52,336 --> 01:54:59,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, if you go into someone else's game, you'll take your player, your player's dog,

1632
01:55:00,503 --> 01:55:02,545
[SPEAKER_04]: The weapons that you've crafted as well.

1633
01:55:03,426 --> 01:55:07,249
[SPEAKER_04]: All the unique stuff that you've made will be in the game.

1634
01:55:07,329 --> 01:55:11,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, if you don't want to be tied into the person's camera, you could go off and do your own thing.

1635
01:55:11,772 --> 01:55:19,098
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, just like the second game, you want to be careful of who you invite in your game because someone may come in and rape all your women.

1636
01:55:19,599 --> 01:55:22,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like, you know... I hate it when that happens.

1637
01:55:22,521 --> 01:55:23,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, exactly.

1638
01:55:23,442 --> 01:55:23,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1639
01:55:24,303 --> 01:55:24,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1640
01:55:26,357 --> 01:55:29,383
[SPEAKER_04]: or hits on the shopkeeper and then they stop working.

1641
01:55:29,423 --> 01:55:32,809
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate it when I leave my house and I come back and all the women got raped while I was gone.

1642
01:55:33,531 --> 01:55:34,913
[SPEAKER_05]: What a downer to your day.

1643
01:55:35,675 --> 01:55:35,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1644
01:55:36,436 --> 01:55:36,657
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1645
01:55:39,617 --> 01:55:42,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Fable 2 and Fable 3 probably not that much different from each other.

1646
01:56:07,927 --> 01:56:08,387
[SPEAKER_04]: What a shock.

1647
01:56:08,688 --> 01:56:17,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Despite all this hype, you know, much like the hype from Fable 1 to Fable 2, don't be surprised if they're very similar.

1648
01:56:18,456 --> 01:56:21,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if I get to bring all this stuff into the game, can I bring Shermie into my game?

1649
01:56:21,719 --> 01:56:22,419
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I want to do.

1650
01:56:23,580 --> 01:56:24,341
[SPEAKER_11]: What would she do?

1651
01:56:25,101 --> 01:56:25,422
Poop?

1652
01:56:25,642 --> 01:56:26,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Not be able to run and catch up.

1653
01:56:27,203 --> 01:56:30,346
[SPEAKER_11]: No, she'd find a towel that was laying around in your game and piss on it.

1654
01:56:31,227 --> 01:56:32,708
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is what she's been doing lately.

1655
01:56:33,989 --> 01:56:35,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck you to my cat.

1656
01:56:36,192 --> 01:56:36,292
[SPEAKER_05]: No. 120.

1657
01:57:03,688 --> 01:57:05,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, 90 minutes for the average player.

1658
01:57:05,169 --> 01:57:09,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently it's the entire first dungeon of the game and two bosses from the game.

1659
01:57:09,852 --> 01:57:14,495
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's coming out on February 25th for the game Darksiders.

1660
01:57:15,996 --> 01:57:20,519
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess they just wanted to see, wanted to really give you a whole in-depth look at the game.

1661
01:57:21,313 --> 01:57:22,654
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like, why not?

1662
01:57:23,194 --> 01:57:28,716
[SPEAKER_05]: If a game is going to take 50 hours to complete, what's with giving away an hour and a half for free?

1663
01:57:28,736 --> 01:57:32,918
[SPEAKER_05]: They could have given away an hour and a half demo for Oblivion and people would still buy it.

1664
01:57:32,978 --> 01:57:33,898
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a good idea.

1665
01:57:33,938 --> 01:57:34,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Get people hooked.

1666
01:57:35,039 --> 01:57:37,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Games like Saints Row where they had a half an hour demo.

1667
01:57:37,780 --> 01:57:39,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I played that demo like 80 times.

1668
01:57:39,741 --> 01:57:40,281
[SPEAKER_04]: It was awesome.

1669
01:57:40,981 --> 01:57:42,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Get people hooked and then there you go.

1670
01:57:42,482 --> 01:57:43,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Kill time until the game came out.

1671
01:57:45,755 --> 01:57:47,357
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura is going to dive into the mailbag.

1672
01:58:00,515 --> 01:58:03,257
[SPEAKER_05]: at Mailbag at OrangeLauncher.com and read some emails right now.

1673
01:58:19,586 --> 01:58:21,049
[SPEAKER_11]: about the general gaming populace.

1674
01:58:21,529 --> 01:58:24,093
[SPEAKER_11]: They have no fucking clue what the average gamer wants.

1675
01:58:24,274 --> 01:58:31,024
[SPEAKER_11]: This guy needs to shut his mouth and also the iPad is a disgrace and I wish it would be the downfall of Apple Go Microsoft.

1676
01:58:31,324 --> 01:58:31,985
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, whatever.

1677
01:58:33,610 --> 01:58:35,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Now this is a little... Can I respond to that real quick?

1678
01:58:35,933 --> 01:58:38,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, dude, you're welcome to your opinion and all that fun stuff.

1679
01:58:38,375 --> 01:58:38,836
[SPEAKER_05]: But you're wrong.

1680
01:58:39,156 --> 01:58:47,484
[SPEAKER_05]: But, like, okay, even if the iPad fails, Apple still has ginormous business as a phone company.

1681
01:58:48,546 --> 01:58:49,987
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that's not what they started as.

1682
01:58:50,047 --> 01:58:53,130
[SPEAKER_05]: They started with those little green monitors that were in all of our grade school classrooms.

1683
01:58:54,191 --> 01:58:58,753
[SPEAKER_05]: but they're a huge phone company now and yet computers and all that stuff too but the phone thing is huge.

1684
01:58:58,773 --> 01:59:03,816
[SPEAKER_11]: The Mac is still the standard of the graphic design industry.

1685
01:59:05,016 --> 01:59:09,118
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I do remember Loki going off on that one show that was kind of funny and yeah, he had a point.

1686
01:59:10,319 --> 01:59:11,299
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll meet you halfway there.

1687
01:59:12,260 --> 01:59:13,961
[SPEAKER_11]: Now for the long ass email of the night.

1688
01:59:14,181 --> 01:59:14,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

1689
01:59:16,024 --> 01:59:16,805
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, LLR.

1690
01:59:16,885 --> 01:59:26,635
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure how much help this email will be, but I was listening to your last two podcasts and wanted to know what it would take to get the video game development companies to be unionized.

1691
01:59:27,075 --> 01:59:29,538
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm definitely no expert, but I work for a local in Chicago.

1692
01:59:30,619 --> 01:59:36,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Although I have no say in the local's decisions or anything, I've been with them for a while now, and I've seen how things are done.

1693
01:59:36,265 --> 01:59:38,507
[SPEAKER_11]: I also work closely with one of the largest unions in the U.S.

1694
01:59:38,607 --> 01:59:39,368
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not an employee.

1695
01:59:39,668 --> 01:59:40,128
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1696
02:00:03,608 --> 02:00:09,933
[SPEAKER_11]: AFSCME, AFL-CIO, and SCIU are one of the biggest unions, SCIU dealing with USA, Canada, and Puerto Rico.

1697
02:00:10,613 --> 02:00:19,260
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the ladies at work said that the video game industry would probably fall under the entertainment category, which would mean that all of the unions that AFL-CIO is the one to contact.

1698
02:00:19,620 --> 02:00:22,542
[SPEAKER_11]: What they need to do is contact their closest AFL-CIO branch.

1699
02:00:22,682 --> 02:00:26,825
[SPEAKER_11]: It all depends, although, because I don't know which video game company you had in mind.

1700
02:00:27,165 --> 02:00:32,469
[SPEAKER_11]: If you were thinking EA, where a friend of mine works, they would need to contact the Sacramento office or maybe San Francisco.

1701
02:00:32,489 --> 02:00:33,290
[SPEAKER_11]: I honestly can't remember.

1702
02:00:33,330 --> 02:00:33,950
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't take notes.

1703
02:00:34,390 --> 02:00:34,971
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's a link.

1704
02:00:35,451 --> 02:00:40,415
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually aflcio.org slash joinayunion slash how slash howto.cfm

1705
02:00:42,597 --> 02:00:45,139
[SPEAKER_11]: Now you can end my email here, but I'd like to voice my opinion on this.

1706
02:00:46,460 --> 02:00:52,885
[SPEAKER_11]: Unionizing video game workers is probably supported by most gamers who feel they should have fair work hours, pay, and everything else.

1707
02:00:53,005 --> 02:01:03,654
[SPEAKER_11]: However, say there's a strike at Square Enix and it prevented the release of the newest Final Fantasy game or strike at Capcom that's keeping the newest crossover fighting game from coming out.

1708
02:01:04,214 --> 02:01:06,155
[SPEAKER_11]: Will gamers still support the striking workers?

1709
02:01:06,896 --> 02:01:08,798
[SPEAKER_11]: Who will gamers choose the product to the workers?

1710
02:01:08,898 --> 02:01:11,540
[SPEAKER_11]: I honestly don't know what I'd want more to be honest.

1711
02:01:12,460 --> 02:01:15,481
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember the writer's strike that prevented new episodes of TV shows from premiering?

1712
02:01:15,981 --> 02:01:19,782
[SPEAKER_11]: Were you reading for the writers or were you craving more episodes of Lost or Ugly Betty?

1713
02:01:20,843 --> 02:01:21,883
[SPEAKER_11]: This is my insertment.

1714
02:01:22,383 --> 02:01:23,003
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't care.

1715
02:01:25,044 --> 02:01:25,664
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really watch TV.

1716
02:01:25,764 --> 02:01:31,286
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you don't watch a lot of TV, but look, from the standpoint of somebody who was like, I think the writer's strike kind of ruined Heroes.

1717
02:01:32,266 --> 02:01:35,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the second season was already kind of poopy, but I don't know.

1718
02:01:36,067 --> 02:01:39,128
[SPEAKER_05]: The writer's strike really damned some shows that were on a roll.

1719
02:01:39,828 --> 02:01:42,770
[SPEAKER_05]: I see the point the email is trying to make.

1720
02:01:43,170 --> 02:01:46,172
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great point and one I didn't consider last week.

1721
02:01:46,572 --> 02:01:48,233
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I'm glad we got emails on it.

1722
02:01:48,273 --> 02:01:53,296
[SPEAKER_11]: But if companies also want to keep their product going, they need to have a quality work environment for the people that are working for them.

1723
02:01:53,716 --> 02:01:54,757
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to respect the worker.

1724
02:01:56,353 --> 02:02:05,583
[SPEAKER_11]: To continue, I remember in high school after I graduated that teachers were striking for whatever reason, maybe pay, and they kept school from starting on time, which meant the end of the school year was that much later.

1725
02:02:05,703 --> 02:02:10,929
[SPEAKER_11]: The students were not happy and wanted the striking to end, not for the teacher's sake, but for their early release.

1726
02:02:12,014 --> 02:02:12,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knows?

1727
02:02:12,334 --> 02:02:17,219
[SPEAKER_11]: I probably didn't want to be on the teacher's side because teachers aren't usually students' best friend.

1728
02:02:17,319 --> 02:02:17,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knows?

1729
02:02:18,299 --> 02:02:21,362
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, I wouldn't know what I'd go for.

1730
02:02:21,462 --> 02:02:28,328
[SPEAKER_11]: If you support the workers, then be really sure you still support them, even at the cost of the release date of a game you're really looking forward to.

1731
02:02:28,808 --> 02:02:29,089
[SPEAKER_11]: Stan.

1732
02:02:29,189 --> 02:02:31,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob, it was nice meeting you when you came to ASEN.

1733
02:02:32,011 --> 02:02:32,852
[SPEAKER_11]: I know I was kind of boring.

1734
02:02:33,132 --> 02:02:33,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay, okay.

1735
02:02:33,893 --> 02:02:34,533
[SPEAKER_05]: I know who this is.

1736
02:02:34,773 --> 02:02:37,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that was a great email and brought up some points.

1737
02:02:37,215 --> 02:02:46,181
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know if you had told me you worked for a union, but that's really neat to kind of see that side of it and kind of brought up some things I didn't think about.

1738
02:02:46,221 --> 02:02:48,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, especially, yeah, what would happen if they go on strike?

1739
02:02:48,983 --> 02:02:51,144
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we hear all these reports about conditions.

1740
02:02:51,184 --> 02:02:52,725
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, I want to make this clear.

1741
02:02:53,005 --> 02:02:56,428
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't necessarily, like, supporting saying they should unionize.

1742
02:02:56,788 --> 02:02:58,729
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just kind of asking the question, what about?

1743
02:02:58,849 --> 02:03:00,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, is it a feasible option?

1744
02:03:00,731 --> 02:03:01,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Question mark.

1745
02:03:01,491 --> 02:03:01,891
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1746
02:03:02,372 --> 02:03:02,632
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?

1747
02:03:04,013 --> 02:03:09,675
[SPEAKER_05]: The only way anything's going to change is if something is done.

1748
02:03:09,955 --> 02:03:13,157
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was just suggesting maybe Union is that something, maybe.

1749
02:03:14,117 --> 02:03:17,058
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's kind of neat to get that email and think about that perspective.

1750
02:03:17,699 --> 02:03:21,240
[SPEAKER_05]: If that were to happen, strikes would be a very real possibility.

1751
02:03:21,380 --> 02:03:27,283
[SPEAKER_05]: And people already bitch and complain when games are delayed, even if the game is being delayed for quality reasons.

1752
02:03:27,423 --> 02:03:28,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, a lot of people have been...

1753
02:03:29,424 --> 02:03:31,206
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, I would like to think me personally

1754
02:03:45,146 --> 02:04:00,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm okay with the game being delayed as long as they're going to put out a quality product at the end like I was really looking forward to Blur that was supposed to come out fourth quarter last year but they delayed it to this year because they wanted to make sure online wasn't fucked and I'm okay with that I would rather they fix it than put out a crap game oh I agree I agree with that

1755
02:04:02,142 --> 02:04:06,485
[SPEAKER_11]: There actually is one more email about the unions.

1756
02:04:07,686 --> 02:04:11,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey OLR, I know we've been on this topic for three weeks now, so I will keep it short.

1757
02:04:12,230 --> 02:04:18,935
[SPEAKER_11]: The problem with unionizing game developers is that unions cost extra money that game publishers are just not going to be willing to pay for.

1758
02:04:19,195 --> 02:04:21,157
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll just hire non-unionized employees.

1759
02:04:21,677 --> 02:04:29,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Lord knows that there are enough people desperate to get into the industry by any means possible that they will work god-awful hours thinking they're the next best game developer since Miyamoto.

1760
02:04:30,604 --> 02:04:34,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, as long as there are people to take advantage of, this will probably never stop.

1761
02:04:35,048 --> 02:04:40,994
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, it doesn't leave much room for people with families who don't want to or simply can't work 12-hour days seven days a week.

1762
02:04:41,694 --> 02:04:49,201
[SPEAKER_11]: These people get suckered in by company lies when they say they're getting hired for the job, saying that crunch periods will only happen on a necessity basis.

1763
02:04:49,962 --> 02:04:53,545
[SPEAKER_11]: The crunch period slowly becomes perpetual, and if they don't crunch, they get fired.

1764
02:04:54,426 --> 02:04:54,626
[SPEAKER_11]: etc.

1765
02:04:54,706 --> 02:04:54,866
[SPEAKER_11]: etc.

1766
02:04:54,926 --> 02:04:55,007
[SPEAKER_11]: etc.

1767
02:04:55,027 --> 02:04:55,087
[SPEAKER_11]: etc.

1768
02:05:18,966 --> 02:05:20,347
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully I kept that brief enough.

1769
02:05:20,447 --> 02:05:34,615
[SPEAKER_11]: As a programmer myself, I count my blessings for being employed by a company that lets us go home at 7pm, though plenty of us stay later willingly, and doesn't make us work weekends, and I think it's outrageous that there are situations like this right in my backyard since I work in Silicon Valley.

1770
02:05:35,035 --> 02:05:36,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Yours truly, AZHP

1771
02:05:37,748 --> 02:05:44,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I wish we could name – I completely understand why you don't want to say who you work for on a delicate subject like this, so please.

1772
02:05:44,635 --> 02:05:55,787
[SPEAKER_05]: But I wish we could recognize whatever company that is and go, yay, and pat them on the back for having kind of a good employee policy like that.

1773
02:05:57,888 --> 02:06:05,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that's what it's going to take is negative press for these companies like EA and whatever else we've heard about with the nightmare hours to curb it.

1774
02:06:06,012 --> 02:06:07,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Bad press is never really a good thing.

1775
02:06:08,373 --> 02:06:08,753
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1776
02:06:08,893 --> 02:06:09,874
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not an easy issue.

1777
02:06:09,934 --> 02:06:13,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this second emailer makes a really good point about the whole...

1778
02:06:14,876 --> 02:06:16,117
[SPEAKER_05]: You get to test Barbie soccer!

1779
02:06:38,439 --> 02:06:44,546
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll look at it, because I like reality TV, and I like video games, and I like House Sparks.

1780
02:06:45,087 --> 02:06:49,431
[SPEAKER_05]: So you would think I'm all about something like the tester, but I know I'm not going to like it.

1781
02:06:50,112 --> 02:06:50,813
[SPEAKER_05]: I just know it.

1782
02:06:52,802 --> 02:06:56,564
[SPEAKER_05]: But something like that kind of glamorizes what might not actually be that glamorous.

1783
02:06:56,604 --> 02:07:00,206
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a little hard watching a show that's basically a commercial shoved down your throat.

1784
02:07:00,506 --> 02:07:01,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you watch it?

1785
02:07:01,806 --> 02:07:04,068
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but I can guess what it's gonna be.

1786
02:07:04,448 --> 02:07:06,029
[SPEAKER_04]: A giant commercial shoved down my throat.

1787
02:07:06,469 --> 02:07:06,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, look it!

1788
02:07:07,089 --> 02:07:08,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's test God of War 3!

1789
02:07:09,150 --> 02:07:11,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my goodness, it's so epic and wonderful.

1790
02:07:12,052 --> 02:07:13,552
[SPEAKER_04]: But look at all these bugs!

1791
02:07:13,932 --> 02:07:14,813
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not gonna be like that.

1792
02:07:14,873 --> 02:07:18,955
[SPEAKER_04]: All it's gonna be is them stupid challenges that are game-related...

1793
02:07:19,315 --> 02:07:45,357
[SPEAKER_05]: and then they get to talk about how awesome it was to get to play God of War 3 before anybody else you know what would make me watch the tester is if RuPaul was the judge you know and that at the end of every episode remember don't fuck it up it's time for you to lip sync for your life seriously if you've never watched Drag Race it's like the best reality show on right now well can I read the last email?

1794
02:07:45,658 --> 02:07:45,918
[SPEAKER_05]: of course

1795
02:07:46,630 --> 02:07:48,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Dear OLR, I have a pair of questions for Loki.

1796
02:07:49,492 --> 02:07:58,500
[SPEAKER_11]: If I buy a banned modded 360 console and play a game with a patch, can I download the patch and will the patch prevent me from playing a burned game?

1797
02:07:58,940 --> 02:08:01,182
[SPEAKER_11]: I wholly understand if you refuse to answer this question.

1798
02:08:01,262 --> 02:08:02,483
[SPEAKER_11]: Stay care, Redertainment.

1799
02:08:03,744 --> 02:08:04,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Repeat that.

1800
02:08:06,486 --> 02:08:07,567
[SPEAKER_11]: A banned modded 360.

1801
02:08:07,947 --> 02:08:08,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1802
02:08:10,529 --> 02:08:12,431
[SPEAKER_11]: And has a game that a patch is released for it.

1803
02:08:12,971 --> 02:08:16,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you download the patch and will the patch prevent you from playing the burned game?

1804
02:08:18,384 --> 02:08:22,730
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the patch will not prevent you from playing the Burned game, but you're not going to be able to connect to live to download the patch.

1805
02:08:23,311 --> 02:08:28,858
[SPEAKER_04]: So you would have to download the patch by some other means and then transfer it to your hard drive.

1806
02:08:29,398 --> 02:08:31,681
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, yes, you would be able to do that.

1807
02:08:33,804 --> 02:08:34,245
[SPEAKER_11]: It's over!

1808
02:08:35,788 --> 02:08:39,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us emails.

1809
02:08:39,771 --> 02:08:41,933
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's the way DarkSakura should end the mailbag every week.

1810
02:08:41,993 --> 02:08:42,453
[SPEAKER_05]: It's over!

1811
02:08:42,733 --> 02:08:48,357
[SPEAKER_04]: There is actually a website, though, that does carry all of the game patches that are out there for Xbox 360.

1812
02:08:49,338 --> 02:08:51,820
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can download them all individually and search by title.

1813
02:08:52,280 --> 02:08:54,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, I do not remember what that website is.

1814
02:08:54,522 --> 02:08:57,784
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know that if you do a search on Google, you'll probably be able to find it.

1815
02:08:57,804 --> 02:08:59,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've seen it a few times.

1816
02:09:00,126 --> 02:09:04,089
[SPEAKER_04]: But that would be the way to do it if you're going to bother patching the game.

1817
02:09:05,600 --> 02:09:06,800
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1818
02:09:24,147 --> 02:09:24,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

1819
02:09:24,988 --> 02:09:25,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Naughty Games!

1820
02:09:25,788 --> 02:09:26,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Bubble Bath Babes 2?

1821
02:09:27,289 --> 02:09:27,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Not quite.

1822
02:09:27,789 --> 02:09:29,370
[SPEAKER_04]: This is actually... Miss World Nude 2010?

1823
02:09:29,871 --> 02:09:32,272
[SPEAKER_04]: This doesn't even really have a game involved with it.

1824
02:09:33,033 --> 02:09:39,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they're just... It's basically, if Ubisoft were to release this today, it would be probably called My Masturbation Coach.

1825
02:09:40,117 --> 02:09:41,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Press A, C, Tits?

1826
02:09:42,158 --> 02:09:43,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the name of the game?

1827
02:09:43,639 --> 02:09:50,822
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's basically a game that tracks your masturbation and whatnot.

1828
02:09:51,703 --> 02:09:55,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, is this like instead of like MyFitnessCoach or WeFit?

1829
02:09:55,464 --> 02:09:56,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1830
02:09:56,304 --> 02:09:59,726
[SPEAKER_04]: It tracks your... Masturbation.

1831
02:10:00,446 --> 02:10:01,006
[SPEAKER_04]: For example...

1832
02:10:05,708 --> 02:10:07,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have to enter it in manually?

1833
02:10:08,929 --> 02:10:09,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Funny.

1834
02:10:10,649 --> 02:10:17,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, the game is from the game developer Waffle, which they win right there because their name is Waffle.

1835
02:10:17,611 --> 02:10:19,171
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't compete with that.

1836
02:10:19,271 --> 02:10:23,252
[SPEAKER_04]: The Eero title looks... Let me butcher this real quick here.

1837
02:10:23,972 --> 02:10:31,754
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like Migeti Ga Toma Ranai Boku 2

1838
02:10:32,914 --> 02:10:33,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm not even going to bother.

1839
02:10:33,875 --> 02:10:36,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we talking like a Belgian waffle or like an Eggo?

1840
02:10:37,037 --> 02:10:37,778
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just waffle.

1841
02:10:38,579 --> 02:10:39,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Waffle, waffle, waffle.

1842
02:10:39,920 --> 02:10:40,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

1843
02:10:44,423 --> 02:10:45,664
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be in a song someday.

1844
02:10:45,684 --> 02:10:46,244
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that.

1845
02:10:46,304 --> 02:10:48,866
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the code name of the game right there.

1846
02:10:48,886 --> 02:10:49,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Waffle, waffle.

1847
02:10:49,427 --> 02:10:54,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so the game records important events or everyday events.

1848
02:10:55,171 --> 02:10:58,734
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, today's play style, Socks Masturbation.

1849
02:10:58,814 --> 02:11:00,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they give you inspirational...

1850
02:11:02,277 --> 02:11:03,638
[SPEAKER_04]: methods of masturbation.

1851
02:11:05,279 --> 02:11:07,681
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, number of times you've wanked today.

1852
02:11:07,961 --> 02:11:10,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Total number of times wanked so far.

1853
02:11:10,683 --> 02:11:14,066
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a graphical chart that has it all.

1854
02:11:14,486 --> 02:11:18,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Time taken for ejaculation and average time taken for ejaculating.

1855
02:11:18,409 --> 02:11:20,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it animation with little dead sperm?

1856
02:11:21,131 --> 02:11:23,252
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got cute anime girls that are in there.

1857
02:11:23,653 --> 02:11:25,274
[SPEAKER_04]: But it gets better.

1858
02:11:26,195 --> 02:11:30,258
[SPEAKER_04]: And then of course they have a wonderful database where you can organize and track information.

1859
02:11:30,999 --> 02:11:33,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Total time spent wanking so far.

1860
02:11:33,642 --> 02:11:35,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Total number of ejaculations so far.

1861
02:11:36,986 --> 02:11:40,992
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, oh, this is even better.

1862
02:11:41,312 --> 02:11:47,741
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they list innovative methods of masturbation you might have never thought about.

1863
02:11:49,242 --> 02:11:57,249
[SPEAKER_04]: including, in the diagram here, it looks like that stuff cut out of foam and then someone has foam pieces in the tube.

1864
02:11:57,389 --> 02:11:57,729
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1865
02:11:58,169 --> 02:12:04,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, but then, of course, the game is sold with a pocket pussy as well.

1866
02:12:04,594 --> 02:12:07,577
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you just used the Wii Fitness board.

1867
02:12:07,997 --> 02:12:08,617
[SPEAKER_04]: The Tenga...

1868
02:12:09,358 --> 02:12:11,939
[SPEAKER_04]: The Tenga Egg Wavy is what it's called.

1869
02:12:12,079 --> 02:12:14,159
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that's what the resistance strap was for.

1870
02:12:15,300 --> 02:12:16,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Ripped for your pleasure.

1871
02:12:16,860 --> 02:12:22,882
[SPEAKER_04]: The cover, I mean, it's just topless anime chicks all wet and thriving around.

1872
02:12:24,162 --> 02:12:26,983
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no way you would not know what this game is about.

1873
02:12:28,423 --> 02:12:28,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Waffle!

1874
02:12:28,924 --> 02:12:29,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Waffle!

1875
02:12:29,204 --> 02:12:29,884
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do this!

1876
02:12:48,399 --> 02:12:55,525
[SPEAKER_05]: So you should be able to do the same thing here and show total lost productivity time to masturbation in the world.

1877
02:12:55,545 --> 02:13:00,709
[SPEAKER_04]: I would imagine that the pedometer could probably be used in slimmer fashion for this device.

1878
02:13:02,030 --> 02:13:04,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Not going to see this on DSiWare, unfortunately.

1879
02:13:06,428 --> 02:13:07,029
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1880
02:13:27,108 --> 02:13:27,689
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm watching it.

1881
02:13:28,809 --> 02:13:30,230
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's funny.

1882
02:13:30,351 --> 02:13:37,156
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically because Travis in the game, the way he saves is by taking a dump in a toilet.

1883
02:13:37,656 --> 02:13:39,357
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the animation that they show.

1884
02:13:39,838 --> 02:13:47,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this chick that's in the game, she's actually taking a shower.

1885
02:13:47,183 --> 02:13:50,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the glitch is that somehow she ends up in the middle... Ew, she goes in the shower?

1886
02:13:50,966 --> 02:13:53,148
[SPEAKER_04]: No, she does not take a dump in the shower.

1887
02:13:54,048 --> 02:13:54,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Shinobu...

1888
02:13:58,433 --> 02:13:59,314
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you a moment.

1889
02:13:59,994 --> 02:14:01,895
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, she's fake naked.

1890
02:14:02,315 --> 02:14:04,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's Sims naked type of stuff.

1891
02:14:06,538 --> 02:14:10,920
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, the thing is that she does not have clothes on and they cannot patch that out.

1892
02:14:11,681 --> 02:14:12,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Go Nintendo.

1893
02:14:15,563 --> 02:14:19,565
[SPEAKER_04]: No word on how exactly to recreate the glitch, but it is on YouTube for those who want to check it out.

1894
02:14:21,186 --> 02:14:23,187
[SPEAKER_12]: Rob is having a real life segfault right now.

1895
02:14:23,547 --> 02:14:24,248
[SPEAKER_12]: It's pretty amazing.

1896
02:14:25,351 --> 02:14:26,212
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna go drop a save

1897
02:14:46,161 --> 02:14:53,624
[SPEAKER_05]: and SSJ100 Matt threw out the requisite tub girl question mark in our chat.

1898
02:14:56,285 --> 02:14:57,325
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not tub girl.

1899
02:14:57,445 --> 02:14:57,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Meh.

1900
02:14:59,666 --> 02:15:00,006
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1901
02:15:00,327 --> 02:15:01,447
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my stomach hurts.

1902
02:15:02,187 --> 02:15:02,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Please.

1903
02:15:02,868 --> 02:15:06,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we need to do the FUs of the week now because I hurt from laughing.

1904
02:15:22,362 --> 02:15:30,445
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to a bunch of little tiny minor things adding up to put me in the single worst mood I have ever been in in ages.

1905
02:15:30,565 --> 02:15:31,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob, breathe.

1906
02:15:31,425 --> 02:15:31,785
[SPEAKER_11]: Breathe.

1907
02:15:31,945 --> 02:15:32,506
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying.

1908
02:15:32,586 --> 02:15:34,606
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know why it's so funny.

1909
02:15:34,926 --> 02:15:35,947
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I'm okay.

1910
02:15:35,967 --> 02:15:36,267
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm okay.

1911
02:15:37,423 --> 02:15:37,883
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com

1912
02:16:07,675 --> 02:16:07,936
[SPEAKER_11]: See?

1913
02:16:09,558 --> 02:16:09,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Aww.

1914
02:16:10,199 --> 02:16:11,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Ew, you can kind of see that.

1915
02:16:11,300 --> 02:16:12,862
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm going to take a picture of it and put it up online.

1916
02:16:13,082 --> 02:16:14,785
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I'm that kind of exhibitionist.

1917
02:16:15,766 --> 02:16:17,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Who wants to see my big bump?

1918
02:16:22,355 --> 02:16:24,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Careful Waffle Entertainment might put that in their next game.

1919
02:16:25,197 --> 02:16:27,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1920
02:16:29,720 --> 02:16:30,380
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate coughing.

1921
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:32,341
[SPEAKER_05]: It's tough.

1922
02:16:34,403 --> 02:16:34,743
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1923
02:16:34,783 --> 02:16:35,823
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not super angsty.

1924
02:16:35,984 --> 02:16:39,706
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to that not funny image that made me not stop laughing.

1925
02:16:40,586 --> 02:16:46,987
[SPEAKER_05]: FU to just moves taking me like three weeks to accomplish moving.

1926
02:16:47,087 --> 02:16:51,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Although everything was really smooth with the big furniture today, I still have so much stuff to clean.

1927
02:16:51,808 --> 02:16:52,688
[SPEAKER_05]: So FU to cleaning.

1928
02:16:53,829 --> 02:16:54,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Grr.

1929
02:16:55,249 --> 02:16:58,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Alan, do you have any FUs of the week you'd like to share with our audience?

1930
02:16:59,150 --> 02:17:05,271
[SPEAKER_12]: FU to having to job search for Super Serious rather than just casually having to find another job.

1931
02:17:07,199 --> 02:17:10,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to try sharing some of your talents in case anyone's looking to hire somebody?

1932
02:17:10,506 --> 02:17:13,232
[SPEAKER_05]: You can always get a job as a video game tester.

1933
02:17:13,854 --> 02:17:14,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

1934
02:17:15,637 --> 02:17:16,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, he's breathing.

1935
02:17:16,820 --> 02:17:17,762
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he qualifies.

1936
02:17:19,631 --> 02:17:20,512
[SPEAKER_05]: So, all right.

1937
02:17:21,072 --> 02:17:25,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go ahead and let me do another story for you guys here from one more story.

1938
02:17:25,055 --> 02:17:29,358
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1939
02:17:29,538 --> 02:17:31,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1940
02:17:31,879 --> 02:17:35,522
[SPEAKER_05]: But we do have one more story, and it's about a new video game movie in the works.

1941
02:17:36,102 --> 02:17:36,682
[SPEAKER_05]: And that movie...

1942
02:17:37,643 --> 02:17:38,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Missile Command.

1943
02:17:39,024 --> 02:17:39,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that's right.

1944
02:17:39,985 --> 02:17:43,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Missile Command apparently is being made into a movie.

1945
02:17:43,767 --> 02:17:44,668
[SPEAKER_05]: At least, well, I don't know.

1946
02:17:44,688 --> 02:17:49,011
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of things they say are going to get made into a movie but don't really, but this is the latest one.

1947
02:17:49,171 --> 02:17:52,213
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got more of a plot than Monopoly, the movie.

1948
02:17:52,393 --> 02:17:54,735
[SPEAKER_04]: And Clue and all this stuff, right, they were talking about previously?

1949
02:17:54,855 --> 02:17:56,036
[SPEAKER_04]: They should not remake Clue.

1950
02:17:56,076 --> 02:17:57,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Clue was awesome the first time.

1951
02:17:57,614 --> 02:18:09,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Well apparently it's coming from the Los Angeles Times that Atari is trying to sell a Missile Command film to a movie production company to get the Missile Command movie made.

1952
02:18:09,422 --> 02:18:11,723
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what it would be about, but whatever.

1953
02:18:11,804 --> 02:18:14,125
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got to be better than Armageddon was.

1954
02:18:15,906 --> 02:18:18,488
[SPEAKER_05]: No word if Yars' Revenge might become a movie.

1955
02:18:18,568 --> 02:18:19,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

1956
02:18:19,429 --> 02:18:21,370
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of movie would you make out of Missile Command?

1957
02:18:23,673 --> 02:18:26,517
[SPEAKER_05]: No word either if Mr. Awesome is going to be in the movie or not.

1958
02:18:27,057 --> 02:18:27,357
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

1959
02:18:27,778 --> 02:18:28,359
[SPEAKER_11]: A crappy one?

1960
02:18:28,979 --> 02:18:29,340
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1961
02:18:30,921 --> 02:18:31,362
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1962
02:18:31,402 --> 02:18:31,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

1963
02:18:32,764 --> 02:18:33,665
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not showing up.

1964
02:18:33,685 --> 02:18:34,606
[SPEAKER_05]: That came up in chat.

1965
02:18:34,866 --> 02:18:36,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Two people asked, is Mr. Awesome the star?

1966
02:18:37,589 --> 02:18:43,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Going back to some years old topics from All Games Radio, the network that we are on.

1967
02:18:44,196 --> 02:18:45,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get to the Skype line and quickly.

1968
02:18:46,018 --> 02:18:50,701
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR If you'd like to give us a call right now, Skype line is open for business.

1969
02:18:50,761 --> 02:18:55,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you can give us a call at username OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.

1970
02:18:55,204 --> 02:18:56,565
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get to your calls in just a moment.

1971
02:18:56,605 --> 02:19:00,928
[SPEAKER_05]: While we wait for those calls to come in, because there's always a little bit of a delay, we'll get to some last minute stories.

1972
02:19:01,069 --> 02:19:01,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1973
02:19:01,889 --> 02:19:10,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, the new expansion for Resident Evil 5, also featured in the Gold Edition, has an Easter egg where you can actually unlock the classic camera.

1974
02:19:11,075 --> 02:19:12,215
[SPEAKER_04]: You already talked about that, didn't you?

1975
02:19:12,415 --> 02:19:14,617
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that was one of my stories that you didn't put in there.

1976
02:19:15,817 --> 02:19:16,158
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1977
02:19:16,438 --> 02:19:16,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1978
02:19:18,379 --> 02:19:21,281
[SPEAKER_04]: You wanted to talk about that, but... Sorry.

1979
02:19:21,601 --> 02:19:22,581
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, how about something else?

1980
02:19:22,721 --> 02:19:23,242
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got one.

1981
02:19:24,562 --> 02:19:28,685
[SPEAKER_11]: On the ESRB site, Q's working on a PixelJunk racer's second lap.

1982
02:19:30,086 --> 02:19:30,446
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

1983
02:19:33,334 --> 02:19:34,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio, who's this?

1984
02:19:34,616 --> 02:19:37,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to know Legend of Zaku Legend of Zaku, what's on your mind?

1985
02:19:49,509 --> 02:19:53,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing much, just recovering from another dull and lackluster weekend.

1986
02:19:56,333 --> 02:20:18,347
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you've probably heard about this story that was hitting up the rounds on Slashdot and I think Kotaku recently about a company, about a video game developer who had operations in Australia and apparently, since for some reason or another were trying to pull out of that country, but before they did, they actually snuck into the Australian offices and

1987
02:20:19,345 --> 02:20:21,246
[SPEAKER_07]: They're developers that they had down there.

1988
02:20:21,306 --> 02:20:26,208
[SPEAKER_07]: They snuck in and they actually took the code.

1989
02:20:26,228 --> 02:20:28,669
[SPEAKER_07]: They took the IP from them.

1990
02:20:29,809 --> 02:20:30,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know what I think about that?

1991
02:20:36,271 --> 02:20:36,452
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1992
02:20:39,453 --> 02:20:39,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know.

1993
02:20:39,993 --> 02:20:40,493
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?

1994
02:20:40,553 --> 02:20:41,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this justice?

1995
02:20:41,693 --> 02:20:44,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they have a right to go in and steal the code that they made or no?

1996
02:20:44,515 --> 02:20:46,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, the whole situation is in a gray area.

1997
02:20:46,975 --> 02:20:48,336
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you have on one hand

1998
02:20:49,539 --> 02:20:58,890
[SPEAKER_07]: According to that company, which is Interzone, they said that because they use a third-party HR firm, they basically...

1999
02:21:00,675 --> 02:21:09,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, they're shifting the blame on them because they screwed up all the paperwork, the legal paperwork with the Australian tax offices.

2000
02:21:10,820 --> 02:21:19,764
[SPEAKER_07]: And especially, they're also blaming that country for not giving them the incentives that they were owed for actually setting up operations there.

2001
02:21:20,825 --> 02:21:27,488
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you see the developers with their other side of the story where they were overworked and to the point where

2002
02:21:28,191 --> 02:21:29,591
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't even get paid at all.

2003
02:21:29,651 --> 02:21:31,552
[SPEAKER_07]: They were literally working without a paycheck.

2004
02:21:33,613 --> 02:21:49,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, I mean, this is one of those unfortunate tales of the video game industry where you have a developer that tries to cut corners even though he's trying to make a quick dollar by trying to

2005
02:21:58,488 --> 02:22:00,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Zaku, do you wear a hard hat when you call on the show?

2006
02:22:01,169 --> 02:22:01,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really.

2007
02:22:01,769 --> 02:22:02,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I was just curious.

2008
02:22:03,270 --> 02:22:14,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, if they're working for this company, though, and the company is paying them to do a job, and the job is to write code for this game... Okay, okay.

2009
02:22:14,274 --> 02:22:19,136
[SPEAKER_11]: The reason why Rob was making banging noises is because that's what it sounds like when you type.

2010
02:22:20,199 --> 02:22:25,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's not my fault that the microphone is so close to the webcam on my MacBook, alright?

2011
02:22:25,867 --> 02:22:30,274
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just saying, that's why Rob was making the noises and asking about the hard hat.

2012
02:22:30,354 --> 02:22:31,916
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't type fluently.

2013
02:22:31,957 --> 02:22:32,838
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm more of a pecker.

2014
02:22:33,058 --> 02:22:34,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, that's what we're saying.

2015
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:36,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, did you just say you're a pecker?

2016
02:22:37,324 --> 02:22:39,565
[SPEAKER_05]: I just... Alright, let's grow.

2017
02:22:39,645 --> 02:22:40,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Never!

2018
02:22:40,946 --> 02:22:44,167
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we give our favorite people the hardest time.

2019
02:22:44,227 --> 02:22:44,448
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

2020
02:22:44,588 --> 02:22:57,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, in all seriousness, to answer the question, or respond to, I guess, the story about it, is that, you know, there's a certain kind of, like, yay hero to the story about them going in and stealing this code because the developers are screwing them over.

2021
02:22:57,975 --> 02:23:04,120
[SPEAKER_05]: But the bottom line is, you know, they are signing the checks and paying them to write code for this game.

2022
02:23:04,220 --> 02:23:08,684
[SPEAKER_05]: And if, you know, it doesn't work out, it's still owned by the people who signed those paychecks.

2023
02:23:08,744 --> 02:23:09,604
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that.

2024
02:23:09,704 --> 02:23:21,934
[SPEAKER_07]: But when you actually go for months without paying your employee and just try to shift blame, you know, not make any any valiant effort to rectify the situation that I mean, the onus falls on that company.

2025
02:23:22,315 --> 02:23:24,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, is this an American company?

2026
02:23:25,017 --> 02:23:25,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this an American company?

2027
02:23:26,838 --> 02:23:32,042
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically an American company which supposedly has a studio in Australia.

2028
02:23:32,662 --> 02:23:34,463
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll get the pantsuit off of them anyway.

2029
02:23:34,803 --> 02:23:42,889
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, right now, the Australian tax board, as I said, they're owed lots of back taxes.

2030
02:23:43,709 --> 02:23:59,375
[SPEAKER_07]: because, you know, as I said, if they outsource human resources and payroll to an Australian company that didn't do their job, it's the parent company's responsibility to make sure that those taxes are paid and everything is settled in whatever country they're operating.

2031
02:23:59,995 --> 02:24:03,817
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this applies for any other company that sets a shop anywhere else.

2032
02:24:03,837 --> 02:24:07,278
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to play by the local... You know, they have to play by the local...

2033
02:24:08,839 --> 02:24:10,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for the call.

2034
02:24:11,501 --> 02:24:11,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

2035
02:24:11,801 --> 02:24:12,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Later, dude.

2036
02:24:36,553 --> 02:24:36,813
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2037
02:24:37,794 --> 02:24:38,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2038
02:24:38,794 --> 02:24:39,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2039
02:24:40,495 --> 02:24:42,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, this is Elite Slayer.

2040
02:24:42,377 --> 02:24:44,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Elite Slayer, what's on your mind?

2041
02:24:45,599 --> 02:25:01,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I was actually on my laptop earlier, and we were starting to talk about the Halo Reach beta, and then they were like, oh, and they wanted to know more about the Halo storyline, and I know a lot about, like,

2042
02:25:01,528 --> 02:25:28,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Bungie in the storyline and so we started talking about it and then this guy came on and then we got into this full-blown argument about whether there were Spartans left in the Halo saga when like Halo 3 was happening or not and I was on the side of that there was because you know just thinking Master Chief was he and the whole storyline was kind of following him and

2043
02:25:28,607 --> 02:25:34,618
[SPEAKER_08]: But you never actually realize, you know, kind of the other Spartans that there may have been less.

2044
02:25:35,589 --> 02:25:56,655
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, but the other guy was talking about this, and I don't know where these facts are coming up, but he said that, um, in Halo 2 and in Halo 3, they're talking about how he was the last Spartan, and there was, um, no one else left, and he was the only guy that could help this war, and to be honest with you, I did not play Halo 2.

2045
02:25:57,416 --> 02:26:04,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I mean, I've watched all the cutscenes and everything, but I didn't watch Halo, I, I watched, I didn't play Halo 2.

2046
02:26:05,278 --> 02:26:15,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though I know what's happening from the graphics to the world's worst cliffhanger on there, but I just seriously don't know.

2047
02:26:16,031 --> 02:26:20,936
[SPEAKER_08]: This is driving me crazy about whether there was actually Spartans left in Halo 3 or there wasn't.

2048
02:26:20,956 --> 02:26:21,096
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean...

2049
02:26:26,693 --> 02:26:53,115
[SPEAKER_08]: is there like a place in the storyline that actually says there is or isn't because how they're talking about how in Halo Reach that's new coming up you know you can play the beta on May 3rd now when it comes up but how they're talking about how he had a squad and then they're thinking they all died you know I just don't know it's driving me crazy to be honest with you out of curiosity do you have your own show because you just talked for two minutes there it was fascinating

2050
02:26:54,853 --> 02:27:05,615
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, yeah, you know, you can say I'm kind of the person that can, I can actually talk a lot, but what I like to do for fun, like this may surprise you, I like to debate a lot.

2051
02:27:05,975 --> 02:27:09,596
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'm not kidding you.

2052
02:27:10,476 --> 02:27:14,957
[SPEAKER_08]: People will be like, after it's done, they're like, you hate me now?

2053
02:27:15,157 --> 02:27:18,518
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, no, dude, I just did that because I was pretty much bored.

2054
02:27:19,518 --> 02:27:20,560
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it, you know?

2055
02:27:21,020 --> 02:27:24,544
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my personality, to be honest with you.

2056
02:27:25,305 --> 02:27:30,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Elite Slayer, I'm going to answer your question quite simply.

2057
02:27:30,831 --> 02:27:31,312
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2058
02:27:34,435 --> 02:27:43,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you happen to catch the new Halo Legends anime series?

2059
02:27:43,659 --> 02:27:47,241
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of different backstory stuff in there too.

2060
02:27:47,261 --> 02:27:48,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2061
02:27:49,782 --> 02:27:51,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, yeah, I'll tell you this, though.

2062
02:27:51,762 --> 02:27:59,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I saw, I saw the first four episodes of Halo Legends, and I looked at it, and I'm like, oh my god, you know?

2063
02:27:59,904 --> 02:28:08,306
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, where, because a lot of the stuff there, it does go along the series, but then it's like, some of the stuff, you know, it's like they're just pulling out of their ass, you know?

2064
02:28:08,626 --> 02:28:10,146
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, where did this come from?

2065
02:28:10,806 --> 02:28:17,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Because in, um, the third episode, they're riding these motorbike things, um, in, like, space, and, um,

2066
02:28:19,180 --> 02:28:20,901
[SPEAKER_08]: It just doesn't make any sense.

2067
02:28:22,603 --> 02:28:25,845
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm starting to say um a lot.

2068
02:28:25,865 --> 02:28:26,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my God.

2069
02:28:26,325 --> 02:28:27,546
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all right.

2070
02:28:27,586 --> 02:28:28,027
[SPEAKER_05]: You're nervous.

2071
02:28:28,087 --> 02:28:28,667
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a radio show.

2072
02:28:28,707 --> 02:28:29,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, wait.

2073
02:28:29,888 --> 02:28:31,509
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got to wrap up here and go soon.

2074
02:28:31,549 --> 02:28:32,430
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've got to be honest.

2075
02:28:32,710 --> 02:28:35,792
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know the answer to your Halo question, but maybe it's the answer to one of these books or whatever.

2076
02:28:36,232 --> 02:28:38,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, there's books too on the whole Halo thing.

2077
02:28:38,314 --> 02:28:42,777
[SPEAKER_05]: But I want to debate you real quick on a certain topic, okay, since you're a big debate person.

2078
02:28:42,797 --> 02:28:43,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's debate.

2079
02:28:44,858 --> 02:28:48,461
[SPEAKER_05]: What is cooler, keyboard playing cats or keyboard playing –

2080
02:28:50,321 --> 02:28:53,762
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, dude.

2081
02:28:54,182 --> 02:28:57,243
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to go with... Yeah, I heard your segment on this earlier.

2082
02:28:57,563 --> 02:28:59,704
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to say cats because just think.

2083
02:28:59,924 --> 02:29:01,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Cats, you've got lol cats.

2084
02:29:01,744 --> 02:29:02,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Cats are crazy.

2085
02:29:02,585 --> 02:29:03,965
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got these animated gifs.

2086
02:29:04,025 --> 02:29:05,585
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got all these things.

2087
02:29:06,206 --> 02:29:08,926
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got to be one of a cool app.

2088
02:29:09,066 --> 02:29:10,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone loves kittens.

2089
02:29:10,187 --> 02:29:10,747
[SPEAKER_08]: They're cute.

2090
02:29:10,787 --> 02:29:12,327
[SPEAKER_08]: They've got all this funny crap with them.

2091
02:29:12,367 --> 02:29:13,087
[SPEAKER_08]: They're swearing.

2092
02:29:13,507 --> 02:29:15,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Kittens have... They're just awesome.

2093
02:29:17,304 --> 02:29:20,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well, you're wrong, and you're an idiot!

2094
02:29:22,080 --> 02:29:22,840
[SPEAKER_05]: No, dude.

2095
02:29:23,120 --> 02:29:24,981
[SPEAKER_08]: I know what I'm doing, okay?

2096
02:29:25,141 --> 02:29:26,741
[SPEAKER_08]: You're a liar, okay?

2097
02:29:26,821 --> 02:29:27,462
[SPEAKER_08]: I got this.

2098
02:29:27,502 --> 02:29:28,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Kittens are awesome.

2099
02:29:28,882 --> 02:29:35,684
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I know I can sometimes be a dog person, but online and iPhones, kittens are so much better.

2100
02:29:36,024 --> 02:29:36,804
[SPEAKER_08]: They're funner.

2101
02:29:36,824 --> 02:29:38,125
[SPEAKER_08]: They lighten up your day.

2102
02:29:38,425 --> 02:29:40,245
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, they make you smile.

2103
02:29:40,345 --> 02:29:40,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.

2104
02:29:42,086 --> 02:29:43,246
[SPEAKER_04]: It comes down to this, okay?

2105
02:29:43,266 --> 02:29:44,347
[SPEAKER_04]: It hurts.

2106
02:29:44,387 --> 02:29:48,608
[SPEAKER_04]: The easiest way you can determine which one's cooler, which is obviously cats, is because...

2107
02:29:49,548 --> 02:29:50,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, dogs are trainable.

2108
02:29:51,029 --> 02:29:53,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Cats are the untrainable, okay?

2109
02:29:53,111 --> 02:29:57,394
[SPEAKER_04]: To train a cat to play a keyboard, well, force a cat to play a keyboard, same thing.

2110
02:29:57,794 --> 02:30:00,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are we even talking about this?

2111
02:30:01,136 --> 02:30:01,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

2112
02:30:01,476 --> 02:30:02,417
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so much cooler.

2113
02:30:03,418 --> 02:30:05,259
[SPEAKER_05]: This is pointless conversation.

2114
02:30:05,279 --> 02:30:10,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Elite Slayer, this has been a heck of a call, but I've got to let you go so we can get some more.

2115
02:30:10,383 --> 02:30:11,663
[SPEAKER_05]: But thank you for your call to the show.

2116
02:30:11,723 --> 02:30:13,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, okay, later, man.

2117
02:30:13,965 --> 02:30:15,606
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what was awesome about that phone call?

2118
02:30:16,447 --> 02:30:18,088
[SPEAKER_11]: The fact that Shermie went and hid?

2119
02:30:18,428 --> 02:30:19,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a damn thing came of it.

2120
02:30:19,809 --> 02:30:21,551
[SPEAKER_05]: We never even bothered to answer his question.

2121
02:30:22,671 --> 02:30:23,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Then he took two minutes to ask.

2122
02:30:23,953 --> 02:30:24,773
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, Wikipedia.

2123
02:30:26,454 --> 02:30:27,315
[SPEAKER_11]: Halo Wiki.

2124
02:30:28,816 --> 02:30:32,639
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole chat room is going, gong, gong, please end this.

2125
02:30:32,900 --> 02:30:33,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Make it stop.

2126
02:30:33,960 --> 02:30:35,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are you doing this to me?

2127
02:30:40,285 --> 02:30:41,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2128
02:30:41,426 --> 02:30:41,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2129
02:30:42,619 --> 02:30:48,302
[SPEAKER_01]: This is somebody who's not going to fap into a keyboard or sit there and get in a stupid conversation about stupid stuff like Halo.

2130
02:30:48,562 --> 02:30:49,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you sure?

2131
02:30:49,903 --> 02:30:50,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm definitely sure.

2132
02:30:50,903 --> 02:30:51,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, really?

2133
02:30:52,124 --> 02:30:52,904
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind?

2134
02:30:53,345 --> 02:30:53,805
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is this?

2135
02:30:53,865 --> 02:30:54,545
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, guys?

2136
02:30:54,565 --> 02:30:55,786
[SPEAKER_01]: This is X-Link.

2137
02:30:55,866 --> 02:30:56,906
[SPEAKER_01]: This is X-Link.

2138
02:30:57,007 --> 02:30:57,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, X-Link.

2139
02:30:57,727 --> 02:30:58,407
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind?

2140
02:30:59,448 --> 02:31:00,428
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing much, man.

2141
02:31:01,229 --> 02:31:06,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Just getting ready to shoot myself in the head with DMs calling every... Oh, I'm not going to get into it, seriously.

2142
02:31:06,992 --> 02:31:11,054
[SPEAKER_05]: X-Link, it's the show where every gamer has a voice.

2143
02:31:11,414 --> 02:31:12,275
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's going to be soon.

2144
02:31:12,295 --> 02:31:20,364
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be called... Next time you go in, wow, I'm going to put a hit on you with every single Horde member going after you for a surprise money for putting DS Master on the line.

2145
02:31:20,424 --> 02:31:29,154
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be like an episode of The Guild, which, by the way, tangent, I watched the entirety of season one and two of The Guild last night with Alan because...

2146
02:31:29,774 --> 02:31:33,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything was packed, except for the computer, because if you're a nerd, the computer's the last thing you pack.

2147
02:31:34,156 --> 02:31:38,177
[SPEAKER_05]: So all I had was instant Netflix, because the PS3 was packed, all the DVDs were packed.

2148
02:31:38,477 --> 02:31:42,799
[SPEAKER_05]: So we decided to watch instant Netflix, and I don't know if you know, but The Guild is now available seasons one and two on Netflix.

2149
02:31:43,299 --> 02:31:53,923
[SPEAKER_05]: And you just kind of reminded me of one of the episodes where one of the guildies is kind of leading a secret double life to make one of the other guild members that she's mad at make his life hell.

2150
02:31:53,943 --> 02:31:55,544
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, what did you think of The Guild?

2151
02:31:56,184 --> 02:31:56,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I loved it.

2152
02:31:56,944 --> 02:31:57,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you've seen it?

2153
02:31:57,865 --> 02:31:58,125
[SPEAKER_05]: X-Link?

2154
02:31:59,147 --> 02:31:59,947
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry?

2155
02:31:59,967 --> 02:32:00,968
[SPEAKER_05]: You've seen it, X-Link?

2156
02:32:01,048 --> 02:32:02,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes, yes, definitely, yeah.

2157
02:32:02,849 --> 02:32:03,909
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen both seasons, yes.

2158
02:32:04,710 --> 02:32:06,771
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little bit over the top for me.

2159
02:32:07,131 --> 02:32:13,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of it's just a little too out there, but for nerd lols, it's pretty good.

2160
02:32:13,414 --> 02:32:14,134
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you think, Alan?

2161
02:32:14,154 --> 02:32:15,055
[SPEAKER_05]: You watched it too with me.

2162
02:32:15,075 --> 02:32:15,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you like it?

2163
02:32:15,655 --> 02:32:16,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was good.

2164
02:32:17,356 --> 02:32:20,337
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been on WoW for about two or three months, so I get all the jokes now.

2165
02:32:20,697 --> 02:32:21,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there you go.

2166
02:32:21,278 --> 02:32:23,579
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, what did you really call in to talk about tonight?

2167
02:32:24,079 --> 02:32:31,406
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I was calling about the Ubisoft and what bastardization they're doing with the whole DRM and that stuff.

2168
02:32:31,826 --> 02:32:38,272
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I said before, and besides the Imagination series and stuff like that, don't forget they also did the CSI series.

2169
02:32:38,752 --> 02:32:44,718
[SPEAKER_01]: They were also part of the Press Your Luck, which, oh yeah, thanks Ubisoft.

2170
02:32:44,738 --> 02:32:47,200
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I can't play any of those cool game show games.

2171
02:32:47,300 --> 02:32:48,101
[SPEAKER_01]: You just hit a whammy.

2172
02:32:48,241 --> 02:32:48,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Congrats.

2173
02:32:49,822 --> 02:32:49,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

2174
02:32:50,763 --> 02:32:53,186
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so now you're going to stop me from playing those as well.

2175
02:32:53,286 --> 02:32:55,408
[SPEAKER_01]: And my mom, because my mom likes this series of games.

2176
02:32:55,448 --> 02:32:59,032
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to make her stop because she doesn't have the internet connection in her place.

2177
02:33:00,592 --> 02:33:01,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Bravo on that.

2178
02:33:01,352 --> 02:33:04,574
[SPEAKER_01]: Though I know there's going to be a patch and there's going to be ways of getting around it.

2179
02:33:04,594 --> 02:33:05,774
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not the least bit worried.

2180
02:33:05,814 --> 02:33:10,356
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, I mean, just the fact that it's going to be a headache just for all that, you know.

2181
02:33:10,977 --> 02:33:12,237
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you said before, it's going to be a headache.

2182
02:33:12,257 --> 02:33:15,839
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have all these people who doesn't know all these different ways around it.

2183
02:33:15,859 --> 02:33:21,101
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to sit here and they're going to flood the support lines because of all this, you know.

2184
02:33:21,141 --> 02:33:23,102
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't take a PC game back to the store.

2185
02:33:23,182 --> 02:33:24,783
[SPEAKER_01]: So best of luck on that.

2186
02:33:25,523 --> 02:33:25,904
[SPEAKER_05]: So I...

2187
02:33:27,813 --> 02:33:29,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think, though, that it's going to work?

2188
02:33:30,155 --> 02:33:32,816
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, don't you think it's just going to get cracked within a couple days?

2189
02:33:32,976 --> 02:33:37,899
[SPEAKER_01]: It will get cracked, but you've got to realize, too, a lot of people don't know this different stuff that we do.

2190
02:33:38,039 --> 02:33:44,382
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of these people I'm going to feel bad for because they're going to buy the game, they're going to open it up, they're going to put it in, they're not realizing this is going to happen.

2191
02:33:44,422 --> 02:33:47,184
[SPEAKER_01]: And once they realize it's going to happen, they're going to try to take it back to the store.

2192
02:33:47,724 --> 02:33:50,385
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to be like, the store's going to be like, sorry, that's tough.

2193
02:33:50,465 --> 02:33:51,786
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have known that beforehand.

2194
02:33:52,046 --> 02:33:53,807
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you and I are on the same page there.

2195
02:33:54,568 --> 02:33:56,389
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to debate me like the last caller did.

2196
02:33:56,529 --> 02:33:58,870
[SPEAKER_05]: That's... Boring.

2197
02:33:59,250 --> 02:33:59,451
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

2198
02:33:59,611 --> 02:33:59,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2199
02:34:00,231 --> 02:34:00,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what else?

2200
02:34:01,072 --> 02:34:03,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else on your mind tonight, X-Link, before we let you go?

2201
02:34:04,093 --> 02:34:05,254
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that was pretty much about it.

2202
02:34:05,314 --> 02:34:08,336
[SPEAKER_01]: I just thought it was kind of interesting when I was hearing about all that.

2203
02:34:09,176 --> 02:34:12,298
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more games than just the Imagination series.

2204
02:34:12,338 --> 02:34:23,785
[SPEAKER_05]: With all these things we're seeing between the Ubisoft news and then we're talking about the whole SOCOM or whatever that game is on PSP that's going to have the multiplayer is going to charge if you didn't buy it new.

2205
02:34:25,046 --> 02:34:26,967
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to see all these inventive things.

2206
02:34:27,407 --> 02:34:29,309
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not even the beginning of the end.

2207
02:34:30,149 --> 02:34:37,113
[SPEAKER_01]: And the interesting thing about that would be that also is I would love to see the responses from people from eBay that don't know about it.

2208
02:34:37,173 --> 02:34:42,096
[SPEAKER_01]: They buy the game used for their son or something, and then they figure out, you know, the son wants to play multiplayer.

2209
02:34:42,116 --> 02:34:44,877
[SPEAKER_01]: They figure out they have to charge $20 for it to get to multiplayer.

2210
02:34:44,897 --> 02:34:46,778
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be interesting to see the results of that.

2211
02:34:47,779 --> 02:34:51,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, interesting as in about like a 20-car pileup on the side of the road.

2212
02:34:52,342 --> 02:34:54,003
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, XLink, got to let you go, buddy.

2213
02:34:54,243 --> 02:34:54,803
[SPEAKER_05]: But have a good one, okay?

2214
02:34:54,843 --> 02:34:55,423
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem.

2215
02:34:55,443 --> 02:34:55,683
[SPEAKER_05]: You too.

2216
02:34:55,784 --> 02:34:55,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

2217
02:34:56,844 --> 02:34:58,065
[SPEAKER_05]: We just have call after call tonight.

2218
02:34:58,085 --> 02:34:58,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to another call.

2219
02:34:58,905 --> 02:34:59,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2220
02:34:59,866 --> 02:35:00,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2221
02:35:01,647 --> 02:35:02,247
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, folks.

2222
02:35:02,287 --> 02:35:03,408
[SPEAKER_10]: It's SSJ100 Matt.

2223
02:35:03,548 --> 02:35:04,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, SSJ100 Matt.

2224
02:35:04,768 --> 02:35:05,569
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind tonight?

2225
02:35:07,870 --> 02:35:08,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Not much.

2226
02:35:08,691 --> 02:35:09,771
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely not Halo Reach.

2227
02:35:10,211 --> 02:35:14,894
[SPEAKER_10]: But by the way, keyboard Zaku cats are better.

2228
02:35:16,048 --> 02:35:16,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I see.

2229
02:35:16,969 --> 02:35:19,511
[SPEAKER_05]: When it talks about keyboard cat and dog cat, ZakuCat wins.

2230
02:35:19,752 --> 02:35:20,132
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fair.

2231
02:35:20,292 --> 02:35:21,553
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you say dog cat?

2232
02:35:22,074 --> 02:35:23,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I say dog cat?

2233
02:35:23,295 --> 02:35:23,975
[SPEAKER_05]: You said dog cat.

2234
02:35:23,995 --> 02:35:24,956
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably did say dog cat.

2235
02:35:25,377 --> 02:35:34,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, SSJ100Matt now is going to make me think of the whole shark and octopus videos with all the YouTubes he was linking tonight, which were A-plus videos, by the way.

2236
02:35:35,686 --> 02:35:38,388
[SPEAKER_05]: When you can get videos to get a laugh on a radio show, you've done a good job.

2237
02:35:38,408 --> 02:35:39,209
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2238
02:35:40,396 --> 02:35:51,042
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um, actually, one thing I did want to talk about is, that will actually get us to the debate, you know, I'm talking about the, the USL Madness going on in the forums.

2239
02:35:51,843 --> 02:35:55,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-huh, yes, we played a little promo from, uh, Breslow a little earlier.

2240
02:35:55,925 --> 02:35:57,266
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about what's going on there?

2241
02:35:58,007 --> 02:36:03,630
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm just, I'm just kind of amazed at just the amount of, like, heat that's going on in there.

2242
02:36:03,750 --> 02:36:08,853
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, right now, Pokemon is beating Final Fantasy VII nine votes to four.

2243
02:36:09,314 --> 02:36:09,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

2244
02:36:09,834 --> 02:36:10,014
Mm-hmm.

2245
02:36:11,115 --> 02:36:18,960
[SPEAKER_10]: My question is, are a lot of people just voting against Final Fantasy VII because they just hate the fact that it's overhyped?

2246
02:36:20,881 --> 02:36:21,241
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2247
02:36:22,041 --> 02:36:28,905
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's a large generation of modern fans that really just do not like Final Fantasy VII.

2248
02:36:29,635 --> 02:36:30,836
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a little bit of both.

2249
02:36:30,936 --> 02:36:35,398
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you have some genuine Pokemon fans, but I think some of that is anti-Final Fantasy VII votes too.

2250
02:36:35,498 --> 02:36:39,380
[SPEAKER_05]: I think like any great political race, there's something like that going on there.

2251
02:36:39,420 --> 02:36:42,681
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish there was more of a sampling of our audience voting in those polls, but what can you do?

2252
02:36:45,615 --> 02:36:51,699
[SPEAKER_10]: But also, you know, we got Symphony of the Night losing to Legend of Zelda, which, you know, that's a good matchup.

2253
02:36:52,519 --> 02:36:54,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, I can't get mad about that.

2254
02:36:55,001 --> 02:36:57,202
[SPEAKER_05]: To be honest, I can't get mad about the Pokemon 1 too.

2255
02:36:57,262 --> 02:36:59,264
[SPEAKER_05]: I realize Pokemon has its rabid fanbase.

2256
02:36:59,284 --> 02:37:03,346
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the anime is still going, and it's been going for, what, like at least 10 years now?

2257
02:37:03,687 --> 02:37:06,068
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the anime is just not losing steam, and I get it.

2258
02:37:06,148 --> 02:37:10,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, if it was losing to a game like, I don't know, Blades of Steel...

2259
02:37:10,971 --> 02:37:12,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on there.

2260
02:37:12,152 --> 02:37:13,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on there.

2261
02:37:13,713 --> 02:37:14,273
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on there.

2262
02:37:14,574 --> 02:37:15,194
[SPEAKER_10]: Now listen here.

2263
02:37:15,294 --> 02:37:15,694
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kidding.

2264
02:37:15,774 --> 02:37:17,476
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to start something.

2265
02:37:17,716 --> 02:37:18,816
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2266
02:37:19,557 --> 02:37:24,921
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um, no, I mean, no, my point is, you know, if you genuinely like Pokemon and think it's a better game, then I'm cool with that.

2267
02:37:24,941 --> 02:37:28,483
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, if you just like, if you're voting against the game that, you know...

2268
02:37:29,605 --> 02:37:34,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Just because it's overhyped or everyone likes it, like you said, haters to the left.

2269
02:37:51,335 --> 02:38:20,116
[SPEAKER_05]: and I think 6 is still in it so you know I'm okay that if 7's out this round and one of the other Final Fantasy games continues but what's weird about the whole setup of the way and it's just I guess the way the cards fell and I know John has this very specific way of seeding everything in the match but it's really weird how like 3 Mario games and like 3 Zelda games are likely to take up the top 32 then again you know maybe Zelda and Mario shouldn't be so good

2270
02:38:21,317 --> 02:38:24,319
[SPEAKER_05]: I know they're good games, I get it, but it's just weird.

2271
02:38:24,980 --> 02:38:33,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I'm saying that because some of the games got grouped as series and some didn't, but I'm sure it had a lot to do with how people's lists were.

2272
02:38:33,346 --> 02:38:37,829
[SPEAKER_05]: If you even look at my list, I probably did have two different Zelda games on it and two different Mario games on it.

2273
02:38:38,309 --> 02:38:44,214
[SPEAKER_05]: They are really good series, but it's just interesting that we're going to be down to 16 and half of that is going to be Zelda and Mario.

2274
02:38:45,563 --> 02:38:48,084
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, you know, listen, I put Blades of Steel as number one.

2275
02:38:48,604 --> 02:38:49,024
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you did.

2276
02:38:49,044 --> 02:38:54,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of jokingly, but you know, I, if you saw, you know, I wrote a ridiculous manifesto, just jokingly, but you know.

2277
02:38:55,045 --> 02:38:55,405
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I know.

2278
02:38:55,445 --> 02:38:56,586
[SPEAKER_05]: And Blades of Steel was a great game.

2279
02:38:56,626 --> 02:38:56,886
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

2280
02:38:56,986 --> 02:38:58,226
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't play a lot of sports games.

2281
02:38:58,326 --> 02:38:58,806
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't.

2282
02:38:58,926 --> 02:39:00,866
[SPEAKER_05]: But I owned Blades of Steel on the NES.

2283
02:39:01,147 --> 02:39:01,887
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how good it was.

2284
02:39:02,167 --> 02:39:03,067
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a great game.

2285
02:39:03,567 --> 02:39:04,087
[SPEAKER_05]: And it had Grotty's.

2286
02:39:04,127 --> 02:39:04,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Only sports can ever know.

2287
02:39:04,867 --> 02:39:05,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Grotty's Minigame.

2288
02:39:05,888 --> 02:39:06,588
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, that's the show.

2289
02:39:06,608 --> 02:39:06,768
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Matt.

2290
02:39:06,808 --> 02:39:08,208
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to let you go so we can wrap things up.

2291
02:39:08,228 --> 02:39:09,068
[SPEAKER_05]: But thanks so much for your call.

2292
02:39:09,789 --> 02:39:10,489
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, take it easy, man.

2293
02:39:10,509 --> 02:39:10,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one.

2294
02:39:12,049 --> 02:39:14,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, apologies to those who didn't get through tonight.

2295
02:39:14,051 --> 02:39:15,452
[SPEAKER_05]: We took like four calls tonight.

2296
02:39:15,512 --> 02:39:19,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually when I take three, so send us an email if you didn't get through or a tweet.

2297
02:39:19,655 --> 02:39:24,198
[SPEAKER_05]: We always appreciate those and we'll talk to you guys hopefully next time on Orange Lounge Radio.

2298
02:39:24,258 --> 02:39:26,280
[SPEAKER_05]: But many, many different ways to interact with the show.

2299
02:39:26,620 --> 02:39:30,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Chat room, Twitter, all that good stuff.

2300
02:39:30,363 --> 02:39:33,766
[SPEAKER_05]: I think all the calls we got tonight were people that weren't on last week.

2301
02:39:33,806 --> 02:39:35,547
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's good to kind of, or maybe Zaku was, I don't know.

2302
02:39:35,587 --> 02:39:37,409
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's good to kind of spread the love a little bit.

2303
02:39:38,189 --> 02:39:44,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we're going to go around and kind of start to wrap up the show, but first we've got to make sure all of our last minute stories are cleared out.

2304
02:39:44,653 --> 02:39:46,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else you guys wanted to bring up tonight?

2305
02:39:46,114 --> 02:39:46,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki?

2306
02:39:46,695 --> 02:39:47,155
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura?

2307
02:39:47,728 --> 02:39:48,388
[SPEAKER_11]: I like chocolate.

2308
02:39:49,669 --> 02:39:51,029
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a news-breaking story.

2309
02:39:51,649 --> 02:39:58,431
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a few things from AOU 2010, the arcade expo that's in Japan.

2310
02:39:58,912 --> 02:40:03,233
[SPEAKER_04]: They're showing off some of the new things, including Sega is bringing Project Diva to the arcades.

2311
02:40:03,793 --> 02:40:06,154
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a rhythm music game.

2312
02:40:06,214 --> 02:40:12,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of looks a little bit like a cross between... I don't know.

2313
02:40:12,836 --> 02:40:15,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like maybe a Parappa-type game with...

2314
02:40:18,021 --> 02:40:18,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.

2315
02:40:19,242 --> 02:40:20,462
[SPEAKER_04]: That Namco singing game.

2316
02:40:20,622 --> 02:40:20,942
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2317
02:40:21,622 --> 02:40:25,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, it's just, you know, like a music rhythm game with chicks singing stuff.

2318
02:40:27,145 --> 02:40:27,565
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks neat.

2319
02:40:27,745 --> 02:40:35,428
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got these, not really poppin' music buttons, but it's basically got four buttons that kind of match the PlayStation face buttons.

2320
02:40:36,548 --> 02:40:37,328
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of neat.

2321
02:40:38,009 --> 02:40:41,170
[SPEAKER_04]: And that'll be coming to arcades, I imagine, pretty soon.

2322
02:40:42,010 --> 02:40:47,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Another one that they showed off that was actually really huge was Metal Gear Arcade.

2323
02:40:48,117 --> 02:40:50,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk about one hell of a complex cabinet.

2324
02:40:50,139 --> 02:40:51,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I heard about this.

2325
02:40:51,701 --> 02:41:00,270
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got these 3D glasses, head tracking built into those, it's like a goggle type thing.

2326
02:41:01,090 --> 02:41:03,313
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a gun that you use and just...

2327
02:41:05,251 --> 02:41:07,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk about... Well, that's just begging to get broken.

2328
02:41:08,393 --> 02:41:11,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, talk about detailed, so that's kind of cool.

2329
02:41:12,115 --> 02:41:14,036
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know when that's going to be coming out.

2330
02:41:15,337 --> 02:41:26,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we were talking, there's apparently there was some concern because of the rumors that Final Fantasy XIV is coming out this year that Final Fantasy XI will be going by the wayside with the release of that.

2331
02:41:27,023 --> 02:41:27,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that for real?

2332
02:41:27,763 --> 02:41:34,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I did remember before I had no internet after the move, I remember reading that story and I was like, there's no official word from Square Enix.

2333
02:41:34,627 --> 02:41:36,188
[SPEAKER_05]: This seems like a rumor run wild.

2334
02:41:36,968 --> 02:41:37,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's the thing.

2335
02:41:37,869 --> 02:41:38,389
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not.

2336
02:41:38,609 --> 02:41:39,850
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to be going by the wayside.

2337
02:41:39,870 --> 02:41:48,694
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, Wada tweeted, there seems to be a rumor that Final Fantasy XI is ending, but if that was done, we'd be in trouble.

2338
02:41:49,835 --> 02:41:50,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Yoichi Wada Yoichi Wada

2339
02:42:04,975 --> 02:42:07,596
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they can't shut down Eleven right now just to make room for 14.

2340
02:42:07,657 --> 02:42:12,159
[SPEAKER_05]: EverQuest 1 and 2 ran at the same time and all these other ones that have sequels.

2341
02:42:12,539 --> 02:42:14,840
[SPEAKER_05]: City of Heroes and Villains are running at the same time.

2342
02:42:15,321 --> 02:42:17,742
[SPEAKER_05]: One's not going to close because the other is out.

2343
02:42:18,162 --> 02:42:20,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Might there be server consolidations?

2344
02:42:22,084 --> 02:42:24,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that could happen and probably will happen.

2345
02:42:24,766 --> 02:42:27,027
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet Eleven has a server consolidation by the end of the year.

2346
02:42:27,287 --> 02:42:28,208
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not going to close.

2347
02:42:28,808 --> 02:42:29,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Not going to close.

2348
02:42:30,049 --> 02:42:37,253
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the last thing, you remember that we mentioned that Perfect Dark would be coming to Xbox Live Arcade during March?

2349
02:42:37,814 --> 02:42:44,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, with that will be the GoldenEye 007 maps from the game on Nintendo 64.

2350
02:42:45,439 --> 02:42:48,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Those will be also coming to Perfect Dark as well as possibly the weapons.

2351
02:42:49,021 --> 02:42:49,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Sneaky sneaky.

2352
02:42:51,002 --> 02:42:53,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for coming and being on the show tonight.

2353
02:42:53,385 --> 02:42:55,587
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you didn't get to say a whole lot, but I hope you had fun.

2354
02:43:15,146 --> 02:43:16,327
[SPEAKER_05]: I did.

2355
02:43:16,427 --> 02:43:17,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for having me.

2356
02:43:17,167 --> 02:43:17,728
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem.

2357
02:43:17,768 --> 02:43:21,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Come again sometime and don't be afraid to speak your mind.

2358
02:43:21,289 --> 02:43:22,870
[SPEAKER_05]: It's where every gamer has a voice, Alan.

2359
02:43:22,990 --> 02:43:25,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

2360
02:43:25,752 --> 02:43:27,273
[SPEAKER_05]: My cat's breath smells like cat food.

2361
02:43:29,634 --> 02:43:30,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, your final thought tonight?

2362
02:43:31,475 --> 02:43:34,437
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is I get to take off work tomorrow because I am sick.

2363
02:43:35,637 --> 02:43:42,221
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is looking at the Dragon Quest slime on Dan's desk kind of makes me want to play Dragon Quest VIII.

2364
02:43:42,661 --> 02:43:44,162
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why, but it was kind of cool.

2365
02:43:44,912 --> 02:43:45,972
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

2366
02:43:46,733 --> 02:43:49,594
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm totally addicted to this Sailor Senshi doll maker.

2367
02:43:53,415 --> 02:43:57,277
[SPEAKER_05]: You are the reason Ubisoft has a market for those designer dress games.

2368
02:43:57,317 --> 02:43:57,777
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm kidding.

2369
02:43:57,797 --> 02:43:59,638
[SPEAKER_11]: No, probably you're right.

2370
02:44:01,178 --> 02:44:02,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I'm kind of jealous watching you play.

2371
02:44:02,939 --> 02:44:08,921
