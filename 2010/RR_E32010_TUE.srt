00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,120
Hey guys, it's Rob Roberts, and welcome to a special show here on our feed at OrangeloungeRadio.com.

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,000
It's Rob Roberts and Pals here at E3 2010, or I guess more appropriately tonight it's

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,520
really Rob Roberts and Pal, as I'm joined by the one and only, you heard him on this

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,920
last week's show, Miklotov.

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,320
Hello, woah, I tried to grab the mic, that didn't work out.

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,240
Yeah, it's been a very exhausting, very long day, and first off I want to apologize for

7
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,600
the audio quality, we are on a different little portable kit, so the audio quality sadly is

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,480
not quite what you're used to hearing in studio, and of course hopefully you've been listening

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,220
to the show the past few weeks, unfortunately Dark Sakura and Loki, due to other commitments

10
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:50,080
and that stuff called real life, were unable to join me at E3 this year, but boy, what

11
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,960
an E3 it's been, you know, I gotta say, so far, just even compared to being here last

12
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,280
year, I'm so much more motivated by everything I'm kind of seeing on the show for this year.

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,720
Miklotov, you haven't been in the show in quite some time, tell the listeners a little

14
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,400
bit about your last E3 and kind of like, what you're thinking so far about this E3.

15
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:17,000
The last E3 I went to was E3 2006, otherwise known as Stupid.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,360
It was crowded and you couldn't get in line for anything, except for like, you could get

17
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,320
in line for the PS3 because nobody wanted to play it at that time, but like the Wii

18
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,120
was impossible to get in line for, it was hot, it was cramped, I absolutely hated it

19
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:37,720
really, but I kind of missed it, so, what was the other thing I'm talking about?

20
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,360
How this year is better.

21
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:50,920
This year is better, it's a little less crowded, this year, last year that I went to, the companies

22
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,960
were trying to outdo each other in terms of how loud they could be, but this year it's

23
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,520
more like, hey, let's just show games and not really worry about, you know, if we're

24
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:07,200
going to, you know, make the other booths vibrate because of how loud we are, so it's

25
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,200
nice.

26
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,120
Alright, we'll get to a little bit about the kinds of stuff we've seen on the show floor,

27
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,200
and you know, I'm kind of taking an approach with these little special shows that we're

28
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,600
doing here, that a lot of you guys that are listening to these and kind of taking the

29
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,360
time out of your day are somewhat familiar with already with what's going on at E3, so

30
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,680
I don't really want to sit here and just recap the news conferences, the most you probably

31
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,680
watch live.

32
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,080
I do know we have some casual listeners of Horizontal's Radio who might be tuning into

33
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,160
these podcasts as well, who maybe didn't watch the whole things, here's the basic stuff you

34
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,160
need to know.

35
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,320
So what, Microsoft was first yesterday, and they were basically, blah blah blah, here's

36
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,080
some games you already knew about that were coming, blah blah Gears of War 3, blah blah

37
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:51,160
Fable 3, one new game kind of thrown in there for you, and then, oh, hey, here's Kinect,

38
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,960
and here's all this Kinect stuff, and boy, this looks an awful lot like all the games

39
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,120
that Nintendo was first showing at E3, and for the Wii and all this, but it's high def,

40
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,360
and oh my gosh, you don't need controllers, and da da da, but most people kind of left

41
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,320
feeling a little bit disappointed, at least, you know, I'm reading Twitter, I'm reading

42
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,840
the blogs, and I have to admit, even I'm feeling a little bit disappointed with what I saw

43
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,720
at Microsoft's press conference, I'll explain my thoughts in a little bit, Shane, it sounds

44
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,880
like you were disappointed too, what was your problem with Microsoft's press conference?

45
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,120
There was nothing really surprising, and that's the best part about E3, is all the shocking

46
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,360
announcements and just the stuff that makes you want to buy these companies' products,

47
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,200
and Microsoft showed off the same stuff that they always show off, first person shooters,

48
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:44,040
an RPG that not many people seem to care about anymore, and then Nintendo products, and I'm

49
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,880
like, okay, well, that sucks, and I'm sure everybody in the audience thought it sucked

50
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:54,120
too, until they got a new 360, and then they probably hated it a little less.

51
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,520
You know, it was very interesting, that little Oprah moment that they did kind of at the

52
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,240
end there, and you get a 360, and you get a 360, and the fact that all of these new

53
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,920
Xbox 360s slim, as the internet is calling it, I don't believe Microsoft is calling it

54
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,920
that.

55
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,920
It's just the 360.

56
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,960
The slim was a term that was used with the Sony systems, and they used that, but people

57
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:20,280
were just carrying it over to the 360, uncorrectly, I guess you could say, but they gave all these

58
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,080
things away, and they were like, oh, yeah, they're going to be in stores this week, and

59
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,440
I don't know, I honestly was reading a lot of feedback on Twitter of people that were

60
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,400
kind of pissed off that they just bought a 360 in the past couple months, and I mean,

61
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,040
I just bought one not that long ago to replace one that had Red Ring of Death.

62
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,800
I'm not angry, per se, I just, I don't really get this new slimmed down system, and what

63
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,160
it has to offer me that the one I already have doesn't, I mean, yeah, I get it, it has

64
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,520
Wi-Fi, but I've already found a way to work around that, and you know, yeah, I get it,

65
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,360
it has the 250 gig hard drive, but I have yet to fill up the one I have.

66
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:03,000
I don't think this 360 slim is so much for me as it is, you know, somebody new, I guess,

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,600
coming on, and perhaps this whole thing where, well, it's actually, it's going to work a

68
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,440
little better with the whole connect thing, which I still keep, I'm tempted to call it

69
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,340
Natal, I don't know, but I did think it was weird that, you know, they're showing this

70
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:21,280
whole thing, and then they give everybody at the conference a free 360 to, you know,

71
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,040
all the viewers at home just kind of sitting there going, oh, and then maybe they're double

72
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:31,640
depressed because they just got a 360, not that long ago, I don't know, I apologize for

73
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,960
my voice tonight, guys, if you've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio, you know, Jamie's

74
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,920
been pretty sick lately, and I think I caught whatever she had, so yeah, there's that.

75
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:47,200
Anyhow, that was Microsoft in a nutshell, so going over to Nintendo this morning, Nintendo

76
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,960
in a nutshell was basically, you know, Reggie comes out on stage, here's the new Wii game,

77
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,200
and here's the new Wii game, and here's the new Wii game, and here's the new Wii game,

78
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,080
don't you ever talk bad about my system again.

79
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,960
And now here's Iwata to talk about 3DS a little bit, and most people were actually pretty

80
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:11,520
blown away by the Nintendo press conference, I think they were very much improved, certainly

81
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,020
over years past, I think in watching what they did this year, where Reggie really came

82
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:22,520
out, it was just like game, game, game, game, I really felt like he was doing what everybody

83
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,880
wanted him to do a couple years ago, what'd you think about the press conference itself,

84
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,880
Shay?

85
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:33,080
Well, I think it started off really poorly, it started off like a Nintendo press conference,

86
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:41,000
where they feel like they can show just games for the casual market, and then nobody else

87
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,560
matters, but then they brought out like Epic Mickey, and then randomly Donkey Kong Country,

88
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:56,080
and that was cool, and then they stole the show, their own show I guess, with the 3DS,

89
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:04,160
and that was amazing, though it didn't dawn on me till just now, no vitality sensor whatsoever,

90
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,720
so that's kind of funny.

91
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,220
It is very interesting some of the things they ended up not showing out, the Wii Relax

92
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:14,220
just disappeared, it's vanished, it's not even to be seen on the show floor, I guess

93
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,520
it's just chilling out somewhere else, and then Sony's press conference happened, and

94
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,280
then admittedly I did not watch this one because we were already out on the show floor at this

95
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:30,520
time, Bobby was not able to join us tonight, he's out at a party or something, I only kind

96
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,800
of read about this on the internet, but the general gist I'm getting is that people were

97
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:40,860
kind of like, oh okay, yeah, games, yeah, okay, PlayStation Move, yeah, we all know

98
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,040
you had to come out with a motion controller at some point, oh, here's Kevin Butler, oh

99
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:50,120
we like him, motivational speech, oh that guy's so funny, yay, and more PlayStation

100
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,520
Move, wait, how much does this fucking thing cost, you gotta be kidding me, oh okay, well

101
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,680
at least we finally have a date for Gran Turismo 5, and oh Twisted Metal, and oh, hey, Valve

102
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,200
is acknowledging the PlayStation 3 now, I guess that's kind of cool, but also might

103
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,240
explain the whole reason why the Portal 2 event got cancelled and then subsequently

104
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,480
delayed, because remember that event was supposed to happen Sunday night, well if the big reveal

105
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:20,680
was that Portal 2 was actually gonna be this whole big PlayStation 3 thing, then you must

106
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,840
kind of see that all those talks and what have you must have just come to pass within

107
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,400
the past couple weeks, you know, when this event got planned and then subsequently cancelled,

108
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,800
because this Sony PS3 stuff must have literally just happened within the past couple weeks,

109
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,280
I don't know, Shane, I know you didn't get to really see it either, but did you have

110
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,600
anything you wanted to say about Sony's press conference?

111
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:48,920
I was once again kind of disappointed, because I was really hoping for some shocking titles

112
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,200
that people would care about, like, I don't know, a new Uncharted would have been nice,

113
00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:01,760
a new Jak and Daxter, that's not that move heroes game, but I think the most interesting

114
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,720
thing definitely was the Valve on PS3, because you have to wonder how much money Sony threw

115
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:14,520
at them to have Steam on PS3 and not on 360, and does that mean we'll get Left 4 Dead on

116
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,560
PS3, does that mean we'll get all of those nice Valve games on PS3 now?

117
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:25,920
It is very interesting how Sony is kind of inching closer and closer to this PC thing,

118
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,000
maybe it really is a computer after all, you know, with the announcement of Steam now,

119
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,800
and then, you know, Final Fantasy XIV is a PC, PS3 title, we've heard about things like

120
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,240
DC Universe Online, which was supposed to be between PS3 and PC, yeah, and that's on

121
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,680
the show floor, sadly we haven't seen it yet.

122
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,700
So I said I wasn't going to talk you off about press conferences, but yeah, there we go,

123
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,040
we kind of ran down them real quick, I hope that wasn't too much for you, but what we

124
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,000
really wanted to talk about here on the show is, you know, I know a lot of you guys at

125
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,360
OLR are watching a lot of this on TV and listening to the other podcasts and reading the news

126
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,880
sites, but we want to tell you a little bit about like, you know, our perspective, what

127
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,940
we kind of saw on the show floor today, what we played, which today sadly wasn't a lot,

128
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:11,320
we spent a lot of time standing in line.

129
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,560
We started the show today, we decided we were going to make a dash to see the 3DS as fast

130
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,800
as possible, because we didn't have an appointment, and we just thought, you know what, we'll

131
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,480
just stand on the line, and if we go there right when the show starts, we won't have

132
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,840
to wait very long.

133
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:28,260
So right at noon, we get through the doors, and you know, considering we had been standing

134
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:33,160
outside the doors for about 30 minutes beforehand, we had a pretty good spot, and we got in there

135
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:38,640
and already the booth was kind of around the corner of the line, so we said, forget it,

136
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,640
we'll get in line anyway.

137
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:48,000
Well, after about two hours, I would say we maybe moved, we barely moved at all, we maybe

138
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,960
moved about 100 people in line in like a couple of hours, it just felt like they were not

139
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,040
burning through people at all, and we were starting to get worried because we had a 3.30

140
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,040
appointment.

141
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,760
Well thankfully, a hero saved the day, and thanks to some connections Shane has, we were

142
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,120
able to actually end up getting to see the 3DS a little bit early, so while we are very

143
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,200
thankful to Shane's connections and so forth, you know, it was awesome to get to see the

144
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,120
3DS and I'll let Shane talk about it a little bit here, but I just kind of, I did feel really

145
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,400
bad for everybody else in line, you know, I mean like, I did and I didn't, I had another

146
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:28,700
appointment I had to get to, you know, and so forth, but I just, I felt Nintendo really

147
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,800
should have been moving that line a lot quicker.

148
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,360
I don't know, Shane, anything about the line?

149
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:43,080
Well, as is standard with Nintendo lines, it was far too long, and poorly managed, and

150
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:49,640
I don't know if that's Nintendo's fault, or the people they hired to stand and guard the

151
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:57,000
lines, but it was pretty awful, it's to be expected though, but yeah, we really have

152
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,240
to give a big thanks to JC for helping us out there, letting us see the system and make

153
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:12,040
our appointment on time, he's awesome, he should be, you know, president of the company.

154
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:17,360
Yeah, so big thanks, but you know, again, I just, in future years, I would really like

155
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,380
to see them, I think at least kind of tell people what the estimated wait time is going

156
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,620
to be, so that people, yeah, like a Disney ride or something, seriously, epic wait times

157
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:31,200
or something, you know, show us a realistic, because you know, all these people, it's not

158
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,620
like people just showed up to the party, you know, everybody here did have to qualify,

159
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,840
maybe it wasn't as media, but everybody is tied to the industry somehow, and you know,

160
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:46,440
a lot of these people have friends back home, and I mean, it is kind of sad sometimes how

161
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,920
much the media just really gets to kind of walk all over E3, and I do realize, I do realize

162
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,880
this is a press event, it's a trade show and so forth, and those are the people that have

163
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,960
priority, but you know, we live in a day and age where, you know, Andy Warhol said everybody

164
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,960
gets their 15 minutes, you know, we've got a podcast, and you know, but lots of people

165
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,680
have their YouTubes and their blogs and so forth, and I just think, you know, there's

166
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,120
probably going to be a lot of negative word of mouth about that line, but I guess the

167
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,040
question would be, did it pay off?

168
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,960
You know, when we got up there, what was the 3DS like?

169
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,920
I'll let Shane kind of talk about the 3DS a little bit.

170
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,480
The 3DS is the second coming of handhelds by far.

171
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:33,920
I was kind of enthused to go see it today, had my reservations, but once I got up there,

172
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:42,440
got to pick up the system, first thing we saw on it was a demo for Animal Crossing 3DS.

173
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,760
I was sold.

174
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:54,800
The 3D screen is only the top screen, and it's just amazing looking, it's sharp, it

175
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:04,560
looks like, you know, there's depth back there behind, gosh I'm so tired, the screen just

176
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:10,000
has all this depth going in the back, and you can adjust the slider on the side to make

177
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,920
it not 3D, bring it back down to 2D, I don't know, for me, I used to hate 3D movies and

178
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:24,240
all that, but now that I've seen the 3DS in action, it is a remarkable little system.

179
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,800
I'm not even sad about the screen size, I have a DSi XL, and I swore I would never go

180
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:37,440
back down to a smaller screen, but it's no big deal on the 3DS.

181
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,960
You know, I was very skeptical about this system, because I have not been a fan of everything

182
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:47,960
very much shifting to 3D recently, especially the movies, I don't have a good time because

183
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,920
it kind of hurts my eyes and so forth, and so I kind of get bothered when I see how everything

184
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:58,080
is going 3D, but you know what, I'll tell you what, the 3DS was a pretty good looking

185
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,080
system, and I was a little worried at first, because when I first opened that thing up,

186
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,480
and I played Animal Crossing first, well we didn't get to really play it, it was a lot,

187
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,000
just so you guys know, there was a lot of concept videos basically, it's like we were

188
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,220
watching a live rendering or whatever of Animal Crossing, or Mario Kart was another one, or

189
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,720
there was a few that they had, you didn't really get to play them, but it gave you a

190
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,860
really good idea of what the games would look like on the system.

191
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,160
But Animal Crossing was the first thing I saw too, and I was like, you know when I first

192
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,240
opened it up and looked at it, I was like, oh it's very similar to that stereoscopic

193
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,080
effect like during Avatar, oh this is going to hurt my eyes, and I don't know about this,

194
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:41,800
but then the gal pointed out you could use the slider to adjust, and sure enough, if

195
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:47,580
I turned it down about, pardon my voice everybody, sorry, this is a video game, podcast guy's

196
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:54,420
worst nightmare during E3, but if you turn that slider down about a quarter of the way,

197
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:59,320
it was perfect, and it didn't bother my eyes anymore, you know, maybe I didn't have the

198
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:04,440
same amount of depth that Shane had, but I was able to get that 3D effect enough where

199
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,540
something like Mario Kart looked pretty awesome with that whole 3D.

200
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,440
Here's the thing though guys, I'm going to be, I am going to put on my skeptics hat a

201
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,080
little bit here, I'm going to say don't jump out of your seat too high.

202
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:25,680
It's still a DS, yes it has higher graphics processing power, yes, you know, it's got

203
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,360
like these multitude of cameras and things that are going to let you see these 3D pictures,

204
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,220
but I think the 3D thing, it's a little bit of a gimmick, just like, you know, the whole

205
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,280
motion control was a gimmick, and it's very important to note, things are not going to

206
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,840
fly out of the screen at you, you know, I think one of the commercials showed the Nintendogs

207
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:48,320
was lifting his paw out of the screen, it's not that in your face, okay, the 3D effects

208
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:54,280
are not going to like, I mean, it's a little tiny handheld guys, but it's subtle enough

209
00:16:54,280 --> 00:17:01,080
and the whole fact that you get that without glasses is pretty cool, it's a very subtle

210
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,640
but very noticeable effect that I think will have a big impact, and I think where it's

211
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,920
going to have an especially huge impact is the fact that the movies are there with no

212
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:13,240
glasses, that's going to be huge for kids, the stuff they were showing, like the Disney

213
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,760
movie, the Tangled, and that was one of your favorite things you saw, right Shane?

214
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,680
Yeah, and one of the reasons why it was one of my favorite things I saw on the 3DS is

215
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:31,440
because of the resolution on the screen, it was amazing, if you've seen any of those pre-rendered

216
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:40,720
videos on DS or even Game Boy Advance, they're all blocky, really, really grainy, terrible,

217
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:47,120
terrible looking videos, but this, I swear, was like watching a DVD, or possibly a Blu-ray,

218
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:55,920
I'm not sure, but it was insane how smooth everything looked, it was like watching a

219
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:01,920
commercial or being in theaters and not seeing these blocky images, just seeing what the

220
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:09,840
creators of the movie wanted you to see, and that alone is, well no it's not alone, but

221
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:16,520
that is another reason why the 3DS is amazing, and I can't, I agree that it's a gimmick so

222
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:24,000
far, the 3D, but I feel that with Nintendo handhelds they start off gimmicky and then

223
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:31,060
you give them less than a year and that form of gameplay gimmick just works and everything

224
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:35,080
they bring out for it just ends up being pretty cool.

225
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:40,800
I'm not, you know, I understand Shane's enthusiasm, but I'm not like quite jump up and down screaming

226
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:46,120
oh my god, kind of like what Shane is, but I will say what I did find, actually almost

227
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:51,720
more impressive than the system itself, was just all the games they have lined up for

228
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:57,560
it, I mean they already have huge franchises, Metal Gear, Kingdom Hearts, and of course

229
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:04,120
all of Nintendo's franchises in there as well, and Saints Row, which got a laugh in the audience

230
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:10,160
and all that, all these people are so on board and I think that, when we talk about the golden

231
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:18,000
rule of gaming, a game is only as good as it's clearly tied very late, it's what, 1255

232
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,400
in the morning right now, it's actually Wednesday, so bear with us guys, sorry it's professional

233
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,200
radio at its best, but you know, the whole golden rule that the system is only as good

234
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,980
as the games that are on it, dude there are tons of games coming out for this system,

235
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:39,360
I still kind of have my whole little antsy thing with handhelds, but, big but here, the

236
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,840
3D is kind of, you know, it motivates me, this is something I'm only going to get on

237
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:50,440
a handheld that I'm not going to get on a TV, I'm sold enough where I will probably

238
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,240
pick one of these up when it comes out, if for nothing else, there's a freaking Kid Icarus

239
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,160
game coming out on it, probably a launch, you know, and this is really going to have

240
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,680
the games to back it up at the end of the day, and if the 3D thing becomes too gimmicky,

241
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,360
turn it off, right?

242
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,540
Yeah, I mean, I think that was a brilliant move on Nintendo's part, to be able to downgrade

243
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:16,480
your 3D to just straight up 2D, I'm assuming they'll require it of every game that comes

244
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:24,360
out for it, but I think Nintendo played this one really well, I'll be interested in seeing

245
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:29,840
what they've held back from E3 about this system beyond the price and the release date,

246
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,480
because you know, there's something about it that they're just not telling us.

247
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,840
You know, I would like to hear a little more about the whole Wi-Fi, like I know they mentioned

248
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,200
during the press conference, like it seemed like, you know, it could kind of like be off

249
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,000
and in your pocket, but it was still communicating, but doesn't the DS kind of do that, except

250
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,800
oh, you have to have a game on, but you can have the lid shut, you know, I don't know

251
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,520
if they're just expanding on that or what they're doing, but I am very curious to kind

252
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,960
of hear more about the communications features.

253
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,520
Personally, I don't think we're going to see this thing until next year, but it'll probably

254
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,440
be early next year, Japan may have it this holiday, I don't know, but yeah, I kind of

255
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,440
go back and forth.

256
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:11,200
It seems like the system has more development to go, but with all of these games already

257
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,800
announced, it seems like, man, they've got a solid year's worth of games already.

258
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:21,720
I forgot to mention, there are two things I'm kind of disappointed with it.

259
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:30,960
The first one, the overall design, the look to the system, very, you know, DS, and I know

260
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:37,920
it's called the 3DS, I was still hoping that was a working title, but I don't know, I've

261
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:43,480
had some ADSs now, I don't really feel like they should have gone with the same design,

262
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,880
and the cases, the metallic cases look very cheap.

263
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:55,360
When I saw it, it reminded me of my Power Rangers from when I was younger, my metallic

264
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,680
ones, same exact sort of coding on it.

265
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:03,400
The second thing that I had a problem with is the D-pad, I didn't actually mess with

266
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:10,960
it, because there was a playable demo we got, 8-bit Xavius, which we didn't mention, that

267
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,800
was pretty cool, and I used the analog stick, which was really nice, but that D-pad, if

268
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,960
you're going to make backwards compatible DS games for it, the D-pad is in a very awkward

269
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:27,560
position that I don't think would feel right holding while playing.

270
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,640
But I think it's also important to note that a lot of this is still open change, because

271
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:36,840
I remember being here, what, 04, when the DS first debuted, and what they showed on

272
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,400
the show floor was a lot different than what the finished prototype was, so we do have

273
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,800
to take that into account with Shane's feedback, that a lot of that could change.

274
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,920
When you think of the analog stick, though, it felt a little cheap to me, but again, I

275
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:53,480
have to remember these are prototypes, but I thought it was effective, like it was actually

276
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:58,080
really easy to move around, and it didn't hurt like the PSP one does.

277
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,520
And that comes from the design of the stick.

278
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,120
It is concave, right?

279
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,120
That's the word I'm...

280
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,120
Yeah.

281
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,120
Yeah, concave.

282
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,320
So your thumb fits in perfectly.

283
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:16,120
It's not flat like the PSP, it's not rounded like, you know, Nintendo 64 or PlayStation

284
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,120
or X...

285
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,320
Well, I guess Xbox isn't, but Xbox just doesn't feel right anyway.

286
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:28,120
But it's just this big circle of an analog stick that your thumb fits in nicely.

287
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:33,240
It doesn't really move a lot, it doesn't have a lot of space to move, but it gets the job

288
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:40,040
done and is comfortable, and I think, as Nintendo likes to do, they put their form factor on

289
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,640
a high priority when designing these things.

290
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,640
All right.

291
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,920
If you guys have more questions about the 3DS, we'll try to answer whatever we can.

292
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:54,160
You can always send your questions to the mailbag, mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com,

293
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:58,140
if you want us to talk about it on Sunday show, or if you want us to try and get to

294
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:04,280
it tomorrow on the Wednesday night show, or maybe I should say Thursday morning show,

295
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,960
www.Twitter.com slash O-L-R is a great way to get ahold of us during the show.

296
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,960
I've been posting tons and tons and tons of pictures today.

297
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,520
Let's talk about some of the other stuff we observed today.

298
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,400
Miklotov, tell us a little bit about one of the games where you just randomly ended up

299
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,120
seeing and games to spend a little time with.

300
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:30,160
Well, as we were walking to get food, I happened to see a booth that had Battlestar Galactica

301
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:37,280
all over it, and I remembered, hey, there is a web-based MMO coming out that probably

302
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,220
will be awful, so we have to go see it, of course.

303
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:46,060
We go over there and ask the guy if they have time for a little press interview, gives us

304
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:52,900
a nice room with, I don't have their names with me at the moment, but one of the head

305
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:57,120
guys heading up the Battlestar MMO from Bigpoint.

306
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,720
Yeah, let's just leave it at Bigpoint.com.

307
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,160
Yeah, what he said.

308
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:09,080
They kind of talked to us about their company and what they were doing with the Battlestar

309
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:17,400
Galactica free web MMO, and they gave us a nice little tour of the pre-alpha, is what

310
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:22,560
they were calling it, version, and holy crap, this might be the first Battlestar Galactica

311
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,960
game that I would not feel bad about playing.

312
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,960
It looked beautiful.

313
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,560
They really captured the essence of the show.

314
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:37,800
They did say they are working with the creative team from Battlestar Galactica on this.

315
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:43,360
It's a very joint venture, but I don't know.

316
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,520
I am interested in playing it.

317
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:51,400
They're shooting for a winter release, and they said that they'd have more details like

318
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:58,880
cast announcements at Comic-Con, which sucks because that is next month and not today.

319
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,000
I would love more information on this game.

320
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,580
Yeah, again, what we saw was very, very early, and I kind of went in with a lot of the same

321
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:10,400
skepticism that Shane had about, oh yay, a web browser based MMO, I'm sure this is going

322
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,160
to be a real winner.

323
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:17,720
We went in and we were like, I have to admit, I was kind of like, wow, these graphics, have

324
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,920
I seen better graphics on a PC game?

325
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:26,360
Sure, but for a web based, no download, free MMO, I was like, that's actually pretty darn

326
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,360
good.

327
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,080
Free is definitely a good price, so I will definitely check out the full version when

328
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,080
it comes out.

329
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,520
I'm not sure on some of these combat games, but it sounds like there's more to come on

330
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,520
this.

331
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,560
I like Battlestar enough, and again, just to at least look at the graphics a little

332
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,720
bit and see if I can actually steer the ship.

333
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,280
Let's talk a little bit about, I'll mention this real quick, we did go by Konami's booth

334
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,840
for a little bit and saw their dance game that they have on Kinect.

335
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,460
There's two dance games now for Kinect, and I'm having a hard time telling them apart.

336
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:05,360
There's Dance Masters is Konami, and then Dance Central is the harmonics one.

337
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,480
Okay, we'll get to Dance Central in a little bit, but I did look at a little bit of Dance

338
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,480
Masters.

339
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:14,480
Guys, I think this is where DDR is going.

340
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,840
To me, there was a lot of very DDR-ish elements in the game.

341
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,460
For those long time Dance Dance Revolution fans, the song list, at least the few songs

342
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,460
they had in this game.

343
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:31,400
You had a Naoki song, you had a Smile Decay song, you had a transplant from Para-Para-Paradise,

344
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:36,160
complete with the same dance, which is making a lot of people compare this game to Para-Para-Paradise.

345
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,360
I think the game might be more accurately compared to Itoy Groove.

346
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,960
It was kind of like you move your hands around and then you pose and all this stuff, which

347
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:51,040
is ironic because Kinect, in a way, the whole thing really feels like what we all thought

348
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:56,120
the Itoy was going to be capable of years ago, but just really couldn't pull off technically.

349
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:01,120
This new technology is allowing it to be a lot more fluid or what have you, but I will

350
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,800
say I have not played the game yet.

351
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:07,360
I hope to a little later on, but I was floored at first because I kind of took a step back

352
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,720
and I was like, wow, it even like perfects are in yellow and greats are in green and

353
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:17,400
a lot of the engine and combos, I was like, this seems to be an Naoki was there.

354
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,520
He seems to be kind of behind it.

355
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,880
This might be the direction that DDR is going.

356
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,920
Funny enough, no DDR on the 360 or PS3 to be found.

357
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,440
All the DDR that was on the floor was for the Wii.

358
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,640
So take that as you will.

359
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,640
Let's move on to one of the dance games we did play, Dance Central.

360
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,760
What did you think about this game?

361
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:45,200
Well, I saw it at the Microsoft press conference on the TV and I was sold.

362
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,640
It's harmonics.

363
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,640
It's going to be amazing.

364
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:53,000
That's what harmonics does, but I didn't really understand how great it would be until we

365
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,200
actually got to play it today.

366
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:02,680
It doesn't feel like a video game and that's probably what makes it so interesting to play.

367
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:07,160
It is a dance teaching game.

368
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:13,720
It's definitely an exercise style game, but it's really fun.

369
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:18,480
You start when you first play, you kind of feel dorky playing it, but then you just really

370
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,160
get into it.

371
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:25,640
It's not one of those games that I would be too embarrassed to play in front of people.

372
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:31,400
You might be when you played DDR for a while or when you would play any dancing game in

373
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:36,660
the arcade or any rhythm game, period.

374
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:41,960
I could see this being a great, great teacher for people that want to start to learn to

375
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,560
dance.

376
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:52,120
I think that was a genre that was sorely lacking in video games because DDR doesn't teach you

377
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,120
to dance.

378
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,440
Pump It Up doesn't teach you to dance.

379
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,600
The dance masters game, it might not be teaching you to dance, but it kind of seemed like...

380
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,600
No, no.

381
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,600
The other one.

382
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,300
I'm talking about the Konami game.

383
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:09,000
It may not be teaching you to dance per se, but it definitely looked a lot more like real

384
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,200
dance, especially if you were mimicking the dancers on the screen, whereas I think the

385
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,080
key difference was that the other game, the Harmonix game, Dance Central, is more about

386
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,680
a choreographed dance that you're learning and you can put together and you learn this

387
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:26,160
very choreographed dance as you go.

388
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,920
I think this is going to be Kinect's niche, and this should be no surprise.

389
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,640
I talked about this on the show a little while ago.

390
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,280
Didn't I even say on the show a couple weeks ago, I said, all they need to do is put a

391
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,880
Biggest Loser game on it, and sure enough, guess what's coming out?

392
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,040
Well, that's not one of the games that was on the floor, but I think the whole fitness

393
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:48,080
thing and the fact that you don't need a controller or a scale or a dance pad or any of it, I

394
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:54,080
think as much as it made a lot of us grimace at Microsoft's press conference, I think that's

395
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:59,160
what's going to ultimately get them the most CNN coverage and Oprah coverage and start

396
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:03,960
to kind of nip at the heels of what Nintendo's doing because of the fact that, you know,

397
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,880
it's just a camera.

398
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,400
And this could be something they start implementing in schools, too.

399
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,840
They would only have to buy one thing for it, all besides the system, and that's an

400
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:22,520
investment that they could easily tailor towards, you know, the kids for their physical activities.

401
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:26,520
I will say I was pleasantly surprised at how responsive the game was, and you could kind

402
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,940
of see the silhouette of yourself, and it didn't look like a lot of stray pixels were

403
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,400
getting in there.

404
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:36,320
The lighting where we were at was even a little bit dark, although we did have a clear background,

405
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,400
so my interest is definitely piqued.

406
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,720
I really want to see how this plays out as well in my living room, although my living

407
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:49,760
room might be a little cramped for Dance Central, I don't know, so it was interesting to look

408
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,160
at, I got to say, and actually play and to get up there and dance to Poker Face and then

409
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:59,920
actually get a five star on the song, you know, when I didn't really know what I was

410
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:04,920
doing, but it kind of showed me enough where, you know, having played enough rhythm games

411
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,160
before, I was kind of able to get the hang of it real quick.

412
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,160
It was cool.

413
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,160
How about Rock Band 3?

414
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,480
Tell us a little bit about Rock Band 3.

415
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,720
Rock Band 3 was cool.

416
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,280
It was rock band.

417
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:25,400
It didn't, for me, okay, I got to play guitar, so I was playing, you know, the same instrument

418
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,040
we've played for the past two games.

419
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:33,360
Nothing very exciting for me personally when we did the demo.

420
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,520
It was cool to have so many people on our little stage, though, all playing together.

421
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:45,960
That was probably the best part for me, and the guitar was blue, so I was very happy about

422
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,960
that.

423
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:53,000
But, you know, you got to play the keyboards, and I didn't get to really mess with those,

424
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,240
so, and that's the most important part about Rock Band 3 from the demo, so I'll give it

425
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,880
back to you.

426
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,080
The keyboards were cool.

427
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:06,640
I did misstate something in an earlier program that we learned a little more about today.

428
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,880
When you're playing in five-bar mode, the keyboard is not split into five different

429
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,320
sections as it looks like it is.

430
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,840
That is for the pro mode, basically only.

431
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,840
I'm not sure why.

432
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,640
I don't know why it kind of sections it off the way it does.

433
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,640
I think it has to do with hand placement, when hand should be hitting what keys.

434
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:29,660
But when you play the normal five-bar mode, you're just playing C, D, E, F, G. For those

435
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:33,400
of you guys that know piano or keyboard, you're just basically playing those five notes all

436
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,640
together, and they're kind of labeled a little bit differently, so it's just kind of important

437
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,840
to note about playing the keyboard.

438
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:43,880
But the pro modes, I mean, seeing that guy, I mean, I don't know anything about playing

439
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:49,280
the guitar, but watching that guy in the demo was playing that White Stripes song, and like,

440
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:53,600
I think at one point they kind of like double-jacked him so that he was in the Xbox 360, and he

441
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,000
was in an amp, and he was playing like the real song.

442
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,060
That was really cool.

443
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:02,000
What he was doing was going above my head, because I know nothing about playing the guitar,

444
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,680
but I do know how to play, at least I did when I was a little kid, the piano or keyboard.

445
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:14,240
It's really exciting that I could probably learn like the quote-unquote real songs.

446
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:19,720
I do like the fact that they confirmed today that there will be a pro mode for bass.

447
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:26,580
It had been rumored that pro mode was coming to the guitar, the drums, and the keyboards,

448
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:34,080
that they were skipping out on bass, because bass gets so little love from anybody it seems.

449
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,440
And the new pro instruments, I don't think that's what they're called, but that's what

450
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,760
I'm calling them, with the $150 guitar and whatnot.

451
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,360
That was amazing.

452
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:52,400
That is definitely taking their music games and setting it apart from anything else anybody's

453
00:34:52,400 --> 00:35:01,440
doing, or they're investing so much into this genre that we can only respect them for it,

454
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,440
I think.

455
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,280
It sounds like they're making a lot of very interesting changes with the single-player

456
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,880
mode too, that I'm kind of curious to see how that plays out.

457
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,460
They didn't give us a lot of details on all that today, they kind of talked about it,

458
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,480
but it seems like they're going to trickle a little more and a little more up to the

459
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,760
release of the game, including more info on the character creation mode and so forth.

460
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:26,280
But I will say this, it was great to hear that pretty much everything is backwards compatible.

461
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,680
Not the Beatles, but I think everybody pretty much expected that, but the Lego Rock Band,

462
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,180
everything could come in, they have a whole new way for you to pick songs, that includes

463
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:38,040
filtering your list, so if you just want to look at Lego songs or you want to look at

464
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,920
songs of a certain difficulty, it seems to be a lot more fluid.

465
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:46,260
They made a lot of improvements to the interface, including people jumping in and out and having

466
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,680
quicker play sessions.

467
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,960
I was pretty enticed by what they're doing with the setup there.

468
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:59,480
Wow, I'm really losing my voice guys, I'm so sorry, but I do want to at least try to

469
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,320
talk a little bit with you guys about what we saw today.

470
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,760
Those were pretty much the games we spent real quality time with, really got to sit

471
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,760
down and play extensively, but we kind of got to look over shoulders and see some other

472
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,760
games.

473
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:20,760
So I quickly saw the OnLive system, and I was like, if that is really streaming in that

474
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,880
little box, that looks a lot better than I anticipated.

475
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,280
I know Bobby's going to spend some time with that, so maybe when he's here tomorrow he'll

476
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,760
tell us a little more about that.

477
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,980
I did see the Tron games, which looked kind of cool.

478
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:37,920
The one I was looking at was a Wii bike, or like a bike, the light cycles thing on the

479
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,560
Wii, but it looked like there was a 360 one too, I didn't really get close enough with.

480
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,000
Probably tomorrow I'm going to get in there a little closer to see a little bit of Dead

481
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,120
Rising 2, which kind of looked exciting.

482
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:53,560
I'm hoping tomorrow I can look at Sony Move and actually get my hands on it, so I can

483
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,400
feel like I'm speaking the Sony side a little more with authority.

484
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,040
I know anything that just kind of caught your eye as we were walking around, let me go talk.

485
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,680
Well, I will actually go to the opposite of that, I will say what did not catch my eye,

486
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:11,720
which would be games that I expected to be there and didn't actually show.

487
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:16,280
Quite disappointed that Nintendo did not bring the new Pokemon games here, they did have

488
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:23,080
one on Wii, and they did have a Pokemon Ranger for DS, but no black and white.

489
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:30,600
And I'm hoping that's because they will switch it up and instead of it being a DS game, they

490
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:38,160
bring it to the 3DS, because I assume we'll get the 3DS by our release date of Spring

491
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,040
2011 for Pokemon.

492
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:46,040
I was very disappointed with walking through EA and not seeing Dragon Age 2.

493
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:51,920
They have already set a teaser release date for it, so I don't see why they couldn't have

494
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,800
at least shown it in video form, maybe it was behind closed doors.

495
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:03,680
Konami, not having a Silent Hill up there to show, that was very very upsetting, however,

496
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:10,800
they kind of countered it with having a Glee Karaoke Revolution, which I will hopefully

497
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,780
be playing tomorrow, because I love me some Glee.

498
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,680
It's kind of one of those things where when I saw it, I kind of rolled my eyes and said,

499
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,400
how did I not see that one coming?

500
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:29,660
Was it just today we were talking about how come nobody picked up a Glee license before

501
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:33,400
we got to Konami, and then it was there?

502
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,680
You know what it was, somebody was making a joke at Ubisoft's Prescott, I think somebody

503
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:41,440
had said something like, oh gee, it's so funny that Ubisoft didn't roll out like a Glee game,

504
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,440
I don't know why they...

505
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,680
Yeah, yeah, you said that, and then suddenly we're at Konami's booth, and oh, well, they

506
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,680
have the license for the Glee game apparently.

507
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:53,640
But, I mean, it makes sense now, they rebooted the Karaoke franchise by dropping American

508
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:59,480
Idol, and instead they're picking up yet another Fox show, why can't dance masters be so you

509
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:04,080
think you can dance masters, or something like that?

510
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:09,820
I think these tie-ins would go great for Konami, I kind of hope they start doing a little bit

511
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:14,140
better and quit putting out some crap titles.

512
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,600
What else caught my eye while we were walking around?

513
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:22,880
Oh, I didn't see Child of Eden at Ubisoft, I was really hoping for that, especially now

514
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:29,800
hearing that you don't need the move controller, you don't need the Kinect camera to play,

515
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:35,280
they are gonna let you use the regular controls, so not having a demo up or anything was kind

516
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,280
of depressing.

517
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:43,880
Yeah, I think, I didn't really get to see much, I mean, we completely skipped over Namco

518
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:50,040
today, I wanna try to find Valve if Valve is around, I wanna play Portal.

519
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,680
Disappointed that Activision thinks they're too good for a booth.

520
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,440
I don't think Portal's on the show floor.

521
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:03,240
So I'm sad that Valve thinks they're too good for a booth.

522
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:09,580
It's a very much scaled down version of the E3 I'm used to, so, little disappointments

523
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:13,360
here and there, but at the same time there's been some really cool stuff just from the

524
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,000
first day.

525
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,600
I don't think it's really scaled down, I think this is kind of like the just right size,

526
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:24,400
like 2006 was too much, I think this year is, and with last year, even though what was

527
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,320
being shown to me wasn't as impressive last year because everything was still a concept

528
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:34,280
last year, I'm relatively happy with the way this year is going so far.

529
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:39,240
I would be happy if Kentia Hall was back and had all the really crappy games and the really

530
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:47,160
awesome games that nobody cares about, but, I don't know, I would, I kind of miss the

531
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:52,920
old big spectacle E3 just because it was so neat.

532
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:58,920
I don't know, it still feels like a skeptical, what am I saying, god it's late, it still

533
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,880
feels like a big spectacle to me Shane, I don't know, but, I don't know, it's been many

534
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,880
of these now.

535
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:10,880
Maybe it would feel like a big spectacle to me if we didn't have to wait in line for half

536
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,880
the day.

537
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:20,680
Yeah, and one other thing, it is still very disappointing just how much of the show is

538
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:28,080
still make an appointment or only special people can get in here and everything is behind

539
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:33,800
these walls and so forth, it's kind of like, I don't know, to a lot of people who do fly

540
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:39,280
out to be here and all that stuff, it's just kind of like, it's a big disappointment.

541
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,240
If they're going to do stuff like that, they need to make it media only.

542
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:50,160
I see people with exhibits only, badges, or, you know, even the people that are exhibitors,

543
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:56,800
they can't get to all the stuff that's behind closed doors, it's just media that have appointments.

544
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,400
I don't see what the point of that is, you're not getting your product out to everybody

545
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:06,720
that you possibly can, that's just dumb to me by far.

546
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:13,480
You know, I don't really care who is the super special club or what have you, I just don't

547
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:17,560
think it should be so out in everyone else's faces, that like, you know, oh these people

548
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:21,280
are coming back here but you're not, you know, type of thing, like that's why they have meeting

549
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,680
rooms in these other places, you know, use the booth space to show those things you want

550
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,800
to show out in the open and have more places for people to walk around so the show doesn't

551
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,480
feel as cramped even though there's less people here, I think that's kind of really the point

552
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:40,580
I'm trying to get to is that just don't be so flagrant about, you know, this is the gold

553
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:44,560
star people only, you know, if that makes sense.

554
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,600
So I get though why they, you know, it's kind of like that bar that's really crowded out

555
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:52,000
for a while, those people want to get into that bar, that must be the really popular

556
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,680
bar but it's just this really kind of trend.

557
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,120
I didn't think there was as much of it last year as I'm really starting to see this year,

558
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:05,020
but going back to 2006, I think there was a lot of that in 2006 too which caused that

559
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:08,920
show floor to just be packed because there's no place for people to go.

560
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:14,560
Gotta say though that the stuff I've seen that's closed for, you know, appointments

561
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:19,760
that have already been made, mostly stuff I don't care about, so I'm not too bummed

562
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,760
about it.

563
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:26,320
The only thing that kind of got me sad was Final Fantasy XIV being closed off, but hey,

564
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,920
we have an appointment for it, so it's all good.

565
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:34,120
Alright, yeah, so we'll be bringing you more information on that coming on Thursday.

566
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:37,880
Anyway, we're just gonna start to wrap up for tonight because it's getting very late,

567
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,280
it's probably after 1am.

568
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:44,920
If you want to ask us questions or give any feedback, twitter.com slash OLR is really

569
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,800
the place to get to us over the next few days.

570
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,320
The thing you're most looking forward to seeing tomorrow, Shane?

571
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:55,880
Oh, that is not where I thought you were going with that.

572
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,880
You know what?

573
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,880
It's not necessarily a thing, I think I'm really interested in hanging out and spending

574
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,120
some time with the Sega booth.

575
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,240
I want to see the new Sonic games.

576
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,300
I want to see the localized Phantasy Star Portable.

577
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:14,680
And even though Bobby said it was terrible, I would love to see the monkey ball on the

578
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:18,360
iPad and see how awful it is.

579
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:21,880
I'm looking forward to just getting some hands-on time with the PlayStation Move, hopefully.

580
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:25,680
I'd like to kind of go in and give that a try because I'm hearing a lot about how it

581
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,720
feels a little more accurate than the Wii does.

582
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:33,280
As far as the press conference goes, I wasn't hearing about a lot of games that I feel like

583
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,880
I need to get, but I'd be curious to go get my hands on it and see if it changes my mind.

584
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,120
I think that's one of the top things I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

585
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:48,300
I think it might be worth braving the Nintendo booth again tomorrow to ABC Zelda, because

586
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:53,600
I don't know what the videos are like online, but that game was running flawlessly.

587
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:57,280
It looked 60 frames a second, it was beautiful.

588
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:02,260
And I would like to try Kirby Epic Yarn or whatever it's called.

589
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:06,480
And the Donkey Kong Country game, because that is amazing looking.

590
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,280
It looks just like Donkey Kong Country and sounds like Donkey Kong Country.

591
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:14,560
All right, so yeah, tomorrow we're going to really try to not stand on as many lines and

592
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,240
just play as many games as possible.

593
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:21,520
So we'll see what we can do, and we'll be back tomorrow with Bobby, who will be here

594
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,060
with us.

595
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,640
And thank you for sitting through our special.

596
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,400
I know it's a lot different than a regular edition of Orange Launch Radio, but again,

597
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,760
we kind of want to get all that out there while we're still thinking about it.

598
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:36,280
And of course, I'll be joined with Dark Sakura and Loki again live this Sunday on Orange

599
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,280
Launch Radio.

600
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:43,280
We'll be talking about a lot of the same stuff, but Loki and Dark Sakura kind of have a different

601
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,280
point of observation.

602
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:48,680
And then of course you guys in chat and all that other stuff, it's going to be a fun show

603
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:49,680
on Sunday.

604
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:55,600
I also think it'd be great if we get some suggestions for things to see on Thursday,

605
00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:00,880
because we won't be able to read them, I'm sure, tomorrow in time for when we go.

606
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,960
But our Thursday is pretty open except for Final Fantasy, so maybe there's something

607
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:11,000
that some people would like to hear about that we may have accidentally skipped.

608
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Absolutely.

609
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,320
So, yeah, again, contact us at twitter.com slash O-L-R. You can try to send us emails

610
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,320
too.

611
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,600
I can't guarantee we can get those as fast, because we can do the Twitter thing right

612
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,600
there on my phone.

613
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,600
It's very easy.

614
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,600
So, okay.

615
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,600
That's it.

616
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,600
We're going to wrap up for tonight.

617
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,600
It's well after 1 a.m.

618
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,240
I need to upload this and go to bed.

619
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:32,640
So this is Rob Roberts at E3, Orange Lounge Special Edition.

620
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,640
All right.

621
00:46:33,640 --> 00:47:03,400
Have a great night, everybody.
