1
00:00:05,877 --> 00:00:06,777
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob Roberts and Pals

2
00:00:26,721 --> 00:00:27,101
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura

3
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:48,760
[SPEAKER_00]: and Loki due to other commitments and that stuff called real life were unable to join me at E3 this year.

4
00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:51,342
[SPEAKER_00]: But boy, what an E3 it's been.

5
00:00:51,362 --> 00:01:00,949
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I got to say, so far, just even compared to, you know, being here last year, I'm so much more motivated by everything I'm kind of seeing on the show for this year.

6
00:01:01,569 --> 00:01:03,951
[SPEAKER_00]: Miklatov, you haven't been to the show in quite some time.

7
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:08,394
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell the listeners a little bit about your last E3 and kind of like what you're thinking so far about this E3.

8
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:15,744
[SPEAKER_01]: The last E3 I went to was E3 2006, otherwise known as Stupid.

9
00:01:17,025 --> 00:01:30,596
[SPEAKER_01]: It was crowded and you couldn't get in line for anything, except for like, you could get in line for the PS3 because nobody wanted to play it at that time, but like the Wii was impossible to get in line for, it was hot, it was cramped.

10
00:01:31,256 --> 00:01:34,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely hated it, really, but I kind of missed it, so.

11
00:01:35,559 --> 00:01:36,900
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the other thing I'm talking about?

12
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:38,822
[SPEAKER_00]: How this year is better.

13
00:01:40,155 --> 00:01:41,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this year is better.

14
00:01:42,396 --> 00:01:43,756
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little less crowded.

15
00:01:45,216 --> 00:02:06,041
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, last year that I went to, the companies were trying to outdo each other in terms of how loud they could be, but this year it's more like, hey, let's just show games and not really worry about, you know, if we're going to, you know, make the other booths vibrate because of how loud we are.

16
00:02:06,401 --> 00:02:07,481
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's nice.

17
00:02:08,601 --> 00:02:11,822
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, we'll get to a little bit about the kinds of stuff we've seen on the show floor.

18
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:22,227
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm kind of taking an approach with these little special shows that we're doing here that a lot of you guys that are listening to these and kind of taking the time out of your day are somewhat familiar already with what's going on at E3.

19
00:02:22,287 --> 00:02:27,369
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't really want to sit here and just recap the news conferences that most of you probably watched live.

20
00:02:28,298 --> 00:02:34,484
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know we have some casual listeners of Orange Ones Radio who might be tuning into these podcasts as well, who maybe didn't watch the whole things.

21
00:02:35,225 --> 00:02:36,586
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the basic stuff you need to know.

22
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:52,121
[SPEAKER_00]: So what, Microsoft was first yesterday and they were basically blah blah blah, here's some games you already knew about that were coming, blah blah Gears of War 3, blah blah Fable 3, one new game kind of thrown in there for you and then, oh hey, here's Kinect and here's all this...

23
00:02:52,725 --> 00:03:19,561
[SPEAKER_00]: Connect stuff and boy this looks an awful lot like all the games that when Nintendo was first showing at E3 and for the Wii and all this but it's high def and oh my gosh you don't need controllers and da da da but most people kind of left feeling a little bit disappointed at least you know I'm reading Twitter I'm reading the blogs and I have to admit even I'm feeling a little bit disappointed with what I saw at Microsoft's press conference I'll explain my thoughts in a little bit Shane you sounds like you were disappointed too what was your problem with Microsoft's press conference?

24
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:32,861
[SPEAKER_01]: There was nothing really surprising and that's the best part about E3 is all the shocking announcements and just the stuff that makes you want to buy these companies products and Microsoft showed off

25
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,411
[SPEAKER_01]: The same stuff that they always show off.

26
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:43,316
[SPEAKER_01]: First person shooters, an RPG that not many people seem to care about anymore, and then Nintendo products.

27
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:53,682
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, okay, well, that sucks, and I'm sure everybody in the audience thought it sucked too, until they got a new 360, and then they probably hated it a little less.

28
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:58,682
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very interesting, that little Oprah moment that they did kind of at the end there.

29
00:03:58,702 --> 00:04:00,143
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get a 360, and you get a 360.

30
00:04:00,643 --> 00:04:07,669
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that all of these new Xbox 360 Slims, as the internet is calling it, I don't believe Microsoft is calling it that, it's just the 360.

31
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:18,377
[SPEAKER_00]: The Slim was a term that was used with the Sony systems, and they used that, but people are just carrying it over to the 360, incorrectly, I guess you could say.

32
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:22,761
[SPEAKER_00]: But they gave all these things away, and they were like, oh yeah, they're going to be in stores this week.

33
00:04:24,144 --> 00:04:24,484
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

34
00:04:24,504 --> 00:04:31,028
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly was reading a lot of feedback on Twitter of people that were kind of pissed off that they just bought a 360 in the past couple months.

35
00:04:32,488 --> 00:04:36,410
[SPEAKER_00]: I just bought one not that long ago to replace one that had Red Ring of Death.

36
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,972
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not angry per se.

37
00:04:39,372 --> 00:04:45,775
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really get this new slimmed down system and what it has to offer me that the one I already have doesn't.

38
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:46,775
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, I get it.

39
00:04:46,795 --> 00:04:49,897
[SPEAKER_00]: It has Wi-Fi, but I've already found a way to work around that.

40
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,360
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, yeah, I get it.

41
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,742
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the 250 gig hard drive, but I have yet to fill up the one I have.

42
00:04:56,422 --> 00:05:12,691
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think this 360 Slim is so much for me as it is, you know, somebody new, I guess, coming on and perhaps this whole thing where, well, it's actually, it's going to work a little better with the whole Kinect thing, which I still keep, I'm tempted to call it Natal, I don't know.

43
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:18,955
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did think it was weird that, you know, they're showing this whole thing and then they give everybody at the conference a free 360 and

44
00:05:20,216 --> 00:05:29,801
[SPEAKER_00]: To all the viewers at home just kind of sitting there going, oh, and then maybe they're double depressed because they just got a 360 not that long ago.

45
00:05:29,961 --> 00:05:30,342
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

46
00:05:31,062 --> 00:05:32,483
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for my voice tonight, guys.

47
00:05:32,523 --> 00:05:38,386
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio, you know Jamie's been pretty sick lately, and I think I caught whatever she had.

48
00:05:38,486 --> 00:05:39,907
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, there's that.

49
00:05:40,927 --> 00:05:43,689
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyhow, that was Microsoft in a nutshell.

50
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:45,850
[SPEAKER_00]: So going over to Nintendo this morning.

51
00:05:46,735 --> 00:05:58,148
[SPEAKER_00]: Nintendo, in a nutshell, was basically, you know, Reggie comes out on stage, here's a new Wii game, and here's a new Wii game, and here's a new Wii game, and here's a new Wii game, and don't you ever talk bad about my system again.

52
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,593
[SPEAKER_00]: And now here's Iwata to talk about 3DS a little bit.

53
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:07,198
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people were actually pretty blown away by the Nintendo press conference.

54
00:06:07,739 --> 00:06:12,761
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they were very much improved, certainly over years past.

55
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:19,623
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in watching what they did this year, where Reggie really came out and was just like game, game, game, game.

56
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:24,984
[SPEAKER_00]: I really felt like he was doing what everybody wanted him to do a couple years ago.

57
00:06:25,144 --> 00:06:26,885
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you think about the press conference itself, Shay?

58
00:06:28,152 --> 00:06:48,966
[SPEAKER_01]: well I think it started off really poorly it started off like a Nintendo press conference where they feel like they can show just games for the casual market and then nobody else matters but then they brought out like Epic Mickey and then randomly Donkey Kong Country and that was cool and then

59
00:06:49,646 --> 00:06:57,253
[SPEAKER_01]: They stole the show, their own show I guess, with the 3DS and that was amazing.

60
00:06:58,454 --> 00:07:05,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Though it didn't dawn on me until just now, no vitality sensor whatsoever, so that's kind of funny.

61
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,303
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very interesting some of the things they ended up not showing yet.

62
00:07:09,343 --> 00:07:13,966
[SPEAKER_00]: The Wii Relax just disappeared, it's vanished, it's not even to be seen on the show floor.

63
00:07:14,027 --> 00:07:15,728
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's just chilling out somewhere else.

64
00:07:16,654 --> 00:07:18,255
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Sony's press conference happened.

65
00:07:18,395 --> 00:07:22,618
[SPEAKER_00]: And then admittedly, I did not watch this one because we were already out on the show floor at this time.

66
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:25,280
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby was not able to join us tonight.

67
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,282
[SPEAKER_00]: He's out at a party or something.

68
00:07:27,302 --> 00:07:27,582
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

69
00:07:28,362 --> 00:07:31,725
[SPEAKER_00]: So I only kind of read about this on the internet.

70
00:07:31,745 --> 00:07:34,467
[SPEAKER_00]: But the general gist I'm getting is that people were kind of like...

71
00:07:35,471 --> 00:07:43,335
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, games, yeah, okay, oh, PlayStation Move, yeah, we all know you had to come out with motion controllers at some point.

72
00:07:43,595 --> 00:07:45,616
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, here's Kevin Butler, oh, we like him.

73
00:07:45,796 --> 00:07:48,858
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, motivational speech, oh, that guy's so funny, yay.

74
00:07:49,298 --> 00:07:52,299
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, more PlayStation Move, but wait, how much does this fucking thing cost?

75
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,660
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta be kidding me.

76
00:07:54,701 --> 00:07:57,502
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay, well, at least we finally have a date for Gran Turismo 5 and

77
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:03,484
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Twisted Metal, and oh, hey, Valve is acknowledging the PlayStation 3 now.

78
00:08:03,905 --> 00:08:10,610
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's kind of cool, but also might explain the whole reason why the Portal 2 event got canceled and then subsequently delayed.

79
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,152
[SPEAKER_00]: Because remember that event was supposed to happen Sunday night.

80
00:08:13,592 --> 00:08:20,378
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if the big reveal was that Portal 2 was actually going to be this whole big PlayStation 3 thing, then you must...

81
00:08:20,738 --> 00:08:26,901
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of see that all those talks and what have you must have just come to pass within the past couple weeks.

82
00:08:27,461 --> 00:08:31,262
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when this event got planned and then subsequently cancelled.

83
00:08:31,342 --> 00:08:34,944
[SPEAKER_00]: This Sony PS3 stuff must have literally just happened within the past couple weeks.

84
00:08:36,405 --> 00:08:39,846
[SPEAKER_00]: Shane, I know you didn't get to really see it either, but did you have anything you wanted to say about Sony's press conference?

85
00:08:41,759 --> 00:09:09,544
[SPEAKER_01]: I was once again kind of disappointed because I was really hoping for some shocking titles that people would care about like I don't know a new Uncharted would have been nice a new Jak and Daxter that's not that move heroes game but I think the most interesting thing definitely was the Valve on PS3 because you have to wonder how much money Sony threw at them to have Steam

86
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,721
[SPEAKER_01]: on PS3 and not on 360.

87
00:09:12,942 --> 00:09:15,605
[SPEAKER_01]: And does that mean we'll get Left 4 Dead on PS3?

88
00:09:15,665 --> 00:09:19,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that mean we'll get all of those nice Valve games on PS3 now?

89
00:09:20,188 --> 00:09:25,813
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very interesting how Sony is kind of inching closer and closer to this PC thing.

90
00:09:25,873 --> 00:09:27,535
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it really is a computer after all.

91
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:33,760
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, with the announcement of Steam now and then, you know, Final Fantasy XIV is a PC, PS3 title.

92
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,343
[SPEAKER_00]: We've heard about things like DC Universe Online, which is supposed to be across, you know,

93
00:09:37,813 --> 00:09:39,695
[SPEAKER_00]: between PS3 and PC.

94
00:09:39,735 --> 00:09:40,717
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that's on the show floor.

95
00:09:41,237 --> 00:09:42,179
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, we haven't seen it yet.

96
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:45,643
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said I wasn't going to talk your ear off about press conferences, but yeah, there we go.

97
00:09:45,663 --> 00:09:46,844
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of ran down them real quick.

98
00:09:46,884 --> 00:09:48,086
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that wasn't too much for you.

99
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:57,671
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we really wanted to talk about here on the show is, you know, I know a lot of you guys at OLR are watching a lot of this on TV and listening to other podcasts and reading the news sites.

100
00:09:58,071 --> 00:10:05,774
[SPEAKER_00]: But we want to tell you a little bit about, like, you know, our perspective, what we kind of saw on the show floor today and what we played, which today sadly wasn't a lot.

101
00:10:05,874 --> 00:10:09,776
[SPEAKER_00]: We spent a lot of time standing in line.

102
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,240
[SPEAKER_00]: We started the show today.

103
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:17,383
[SPEAKER_00]: We decided we were going to make a dash to see the 3DS as fast as possible because we didn't have an appointment.

104
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:23,185
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just thought, you know what, we'll just stand in the line and if we go there right when the show starts, we won't have to wait very long.

105
00:10:23,766 --> 00:10:31,689
[SPEAKER_00]: So right at noon, we get through the doors and, you know, considering we had been standing outside the doors for about 30 minutes beforehand, we had a pretty good spot.

106
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:36,592
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got in there and already the booth was kind of around the corner of the line.

107
00:10:37,152 --> 00:10:39,533
[SPEAKER_00]: So we said, forget it, we'll get in line anyway.

108
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:44,202
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, after about two hours, I would say we maybe moved.

109
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,626
[SPEAKER_00]: We barely moved at all.

110
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:52,191
[SPEAKER_00]: We maybe moved about 100 people in line in like a couple of hours.

111
00:10:52,571 --> 00:10:55,255
[SPEAKER_00]: It just felt like they were not burning through people at all.

112
00:10:55,295 --> 00:10:57,918
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were starting to get worried because we had a 3.30 appointment.

113
00:10:58,899 --> 00:10:59,800
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thankfully...

114
00:11:00,584 --> 00:11:07,671
[SPEAKER_00]: Hero saved the day and thanks to some connections Shane has, we were able to actually end up getting to see the 3DS a little bit early.

115
00:11:08,131 --> 00:11:16,959
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we are very thankful to Shane's connections and so forth, it was awesome to get to see the 3DS and I'll let Shane talk about it a little bit here.

116
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,941
[SPEAKER_00]: I did feel really bad for everybody else in line.

117
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:22,842
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I did and I didn't.

118
00:11:22,962 --> 00:11:31,265
[SPEAKER_00]: I had another appointment I had to get to and so forth, but I felt Nintendo really should have been moving that line a lot quicker.

119
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:32,145
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

120
00:11:32,645 --> 00:11:34,106
[SPEAKER_00]: Shane, anything about the line?

121
00:11:35,785 --> 00:11:42,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as is standard with Nintendo lines, it was far too long and poorly managed.

122
00:11:42,747 --> 00:11:53,849
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if that's Nintendo's fault or the people they hired to stand and guard the lines, but it was pretty awful, to be expected though.

123
00:11:55,389 --> 00:12:02,471
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we really have to give a big thanks to JC for helping us out there, letting us

124
00:12:03,027 --> 00:12:05,568
[SPEAKER_01]: See the system and make our appointment on time.

125
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:08,350
[SPEAKER_01]: He's awesome.

126
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,691
[SPEAKER_01]: He should be president of the company.

127
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:13,732
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so big thanks.

128
00:12:13,812 --> 00:12:18,995
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, in future years, I would really like to see them, I think at least...

129
00:12:20,056 --> 00:12:22,819
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell people what the estimated wait time is going to be.

130
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,980
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like a Disney ride or something.

131
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,062
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, epic wait times or something.

132
00:12:27,763 --> 00:12:34,448
[SPEAKER_00]: Show us a realistic... Because all these people, it's not like people just showed up to the party.

133
00:12:34,528 --> 00:12:36,550
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody here did have to qualify.

134
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:39,993
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it wasn't as media, but everybody is tied to the industry somehow.

135
00:12:40,433 --> 00:12:42,935
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these people have friends back home.

136
00:12:43,075 --> 00:12:45,998
[SPEAKER_00]: It is kind of sad sometimes.

137
00:12:46,397 --> 00:12:49,979
[SPEAKER_00]: How much the media just really gets to kind of walk all over E3.

138
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:53,001
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do realize, I do realize this is a press event.

139
00:12:53,402 --> 00:12:54,883
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a trade show and so forth.

140
00:12:55,103 --> 00:12:56,444
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the people that have priority.

141
00:12:56,484 --> 00:13:02,027
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we live in a day and age where, you know, Andy Warhol said everybody gets their 15 minutes.

142
00:13:02,107 --> 00:13:07,171
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've got a podcast and, you know, but lots of people have their YouTubes and their blogs and so forth.

143
00:13:07,211 --> 00:13:11,453
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just think, you know, there's probably going to be a lot of negative word of mouth about that line.

144
00:13:12,194 --> 00:13:12,434
[SPEAKER_00]: But

145
00:13:12,853 --> 00:13:15,355
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the question would be, did it pay off?

146
00:13:15,815 --> 00:13:18,877
[SPEAKER_00]: When we got up there, what was the 3DS like?

147
00:13:18,937 --> 00:13:21,039
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let Shane talk about the 3DS a little bit.

148
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,442
[SPEAKER_01]: The 3DS is the second coming of handhelds by far.

149
00:13:27,663 --> 00:13:40,972
[SPEAKER_01]: I was kind of enthused to go see it today, had my reservations, but once I got up there, got to pick up the system, first thing we saw on it was a demo for Animal Crossing 3DS.

150
00:13:42,706 --> 00:13:43,347
[SPEAKER_01]: I was sold.

151
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:51,740
[SPEAKER_01]: The 3D screen is only the top screen and it's just amazing looking.

152
00:13:51,821 --> 00:13:52,842
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sharp.

153
00:13:54,705 --> 00:13:55,707
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like

154
00:13:56,365 --> 00:14:12,845
[SPEAKER_01]: you know there's depth back there and behind or in the gosh I'm so tired that the screen just has all this depth going in the back and you can adjust the slider on the side to make it not 3d bring it back down to 2d

155
00:14:13,966 --> 00:14:14,346
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

156
00:14:14,786 --> 00:14:23,649
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, I used to hate 3D movies and all that, but now that I've seen the 3DS in action, it is a remarkable little system.

157
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:25,969
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even sad about the screen size.

158
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:34,492
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a DSi XL, and I swore I would never go back down to a smaller screen, but it's no big deal on the 3DS.

159
00:14:37,412 --> 00:14:44,557
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was very skeptical about this system because I have not been a fan of everything very much shifting to 3D recently.

160
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:49,760
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially, you know, the movies, I don't have a good time because it kind of hurts my eyes and so forth.

161
00:14:50,581 --> 00:14:53,923
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I kind of get bothered when I see how, like, everything's going 3D.

162
00:14:54,283 --> 00:14:59,747
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what, I'll tell you what, the 3DS was a pretty good looking system and I was a little worried at first.

163
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:05,271
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when I first opened that thing up, and I played Animal Crossing first tour, well, we didn't get to really play it.

164
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:05,531
[SPEAKER_00]: It was...

165
00:15:05,911 --> 00:15:10,435
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot, just so you guys know, there was a lot of concept videos, basically.

166
00:15:10,475 --> 00:15:14,958
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we were watching a live rendering or whatever of Animal Crossing.

167
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:16,900
[SPEAKER_00]: Or Mario Kart was another one.

168
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,661
[SPEAKER_00]: Or there was, you know, a few that they had.

169
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:24,165
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't really get to play them, but it gave you a really good idea of what the games would look like on the system.

170
00:15:24,806 --> 00:15:26,607
[SPEAKER_00]: But Animal Crossing was the first thing I saw, too.

171
00:15:26,988 --> 00:15:33,893
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, you know, when I first opened it up and looked at it, I was like, oh, it's very similar to that stereoscopic effect like during Avatar and

172
00:15:34,332 --> 00:15:36,593
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is going to hurt my eyes, and I don't know about this.

173
00:15:37,013 --> 00:15:40,455
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the gal pointed out you could use the slider to adjust.

174
00:15:40,935 --> 00:15:45,158
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, if I turned it down about... Pardon my voice, everybody.

175
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:45,418
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

176
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:49,640
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a video game podcast guy's worst nightmare during E3.

177
00:15:50,721 --> 00:15:57,124
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you turn that slider down about a quarter of the way, it was perfect, and it didn't bother my eyes anymore.

178
00:15:58,065 --> 00:16:08,634
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I didn't have the same amount of depth that Shane had, but I was able to get that 3D effect enough where something like Mario Kart looked pretty awesome with that whole 3D.

179
00:16:09,474 --> 00:16:10,495
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the thing though, guys.

180
00:16:11,196 --> 00:16:14,038
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to put on my skeptics hat a little bit here.

181
00:16:14,418 --> 00:16:17,020
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say, don't jump out of your seat too high.

182
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:19,142
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still a DS.

183
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:23,185
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it has higher graphics processing power.

184
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:29,220
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's got these multitude of cameras and things that are going to let you see these 3D pictures.

185
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,682
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the 3D thing, it's a little bit of a gimmick.

186
00:16:33,183 --> 00:16:35,344
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like the whole motion control was a gimmick.

187
00:16:35,764 --> 00:16:40,528
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very important to note, things are not going to fly out of the screen at you.

188
00:16:40,568 --> 00:16:44,891
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the commercials showed the Nintendogs was lifting his paw out of the screen.

189
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:46,832
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that in your face.

190
00:16:47,693 --> 00:16:52,056
[SPEAKER_00]: The 3D effects are not going to like... It's a little tiny handheld, guys.

191
00:16:52,932 --> 00:16:54,172
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's subtle enough.

192
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:59,174
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole fact that you get that without glasses is pretty cool.

193
00:16:59,735 --> 00:17:04,116
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very subtle but very noticeable effect that I think will have a big impact.

194
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:09,618
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think where it's going to have an especially huge impact is the fact that the movies are there with no glasses.

195
00:17:09,978 --> 00:17:11,579
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be huge for kids.

196
00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:13,960
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff they were showing, like the Disney movie, The Tangled.

197
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,641
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of your favorite things you saw, right, Shane?

198
00:17:17,685 --> 00:17:25,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and one of the reasons why it was one of my favorite things I saw on the 3DS is because of the resolution on the screen.

199
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:28,054
[SPEAKER_01]: It was amazing.

200
00:17:28,954 --> 00:17:35,200
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've seen any of those pre-rendered videos on DS, or even Game Boy Advance, they're all...

201
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:41,842
[SPEAKER_01]: Blocky, really, really grainy, terrible, terrible looking videos.

202
00:17:42,342 --> 00:17:45,323
[SPEAKER_01]: But this, I swear, was like watching a DVD.

203
00:17:45,904 --> 00:17:47,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Or possibly a Blu-ray, I'm not sure.

204
00:17:48,905 --> 00:17:53,626
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was insane how smooth everything looked.

205
00:17:54,106 --> 00:18:04,130
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like watching a commercial or being in theaters and not seeing these blocky images, just seeing what the creators of the movie wanted you to see.

206
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:04,450
[SPEAKER_01]: And

207
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:33,415
[SPEAKER_01]: that alone is well no it's not alone but that is another reason why the 3DS is amazing and I can't I agree that it's a gimmick so far the 3D but I feel that with Nintendo handhelds they start off gimmicky and then you give them less than a year and that form of gameplay gimmick just works and everything they bring out for it just ends up being pretty cool

208
00:18:35,388 --> 00:18:42,950
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, you know, I understand Shane's enthusiasm, but I'm not like quite jump up and down screaming, oh my God, kind of like what Shane is.

209
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:51,851
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will say what I did find actually almost more impressive than the system itself was just all the games they have lined up for it.

210
00:18:51,891 --> 00:19:00,013
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they already have huge franchises, Metal Gear, Kingdom Hearts, you know, and of course, all of Nintendo's franchises in there as well.

211
00:19:00,433 --> 00:19:04,474
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all Saints Row, which got a laugh in the audience and all that.

212
00:19:05,939 --> 00:19:32,079
[SPEAKER_00]: all these people are so on board and I think that when we talk about the golden rule of gaming a game is only as good as the system it's clearly tied very late it's what 12.55 in the morning right now it's actually Wednesday so bear with us guys sorry it's professional radio at it's best but you know the whole golden rule that the system is only as good as the games that are on it dude there are tons of games coming out for the system

213
00:19:33,075 --> 00:19:42,983
[SPEAKER_00]: I still kind of have my whole little antsy thing with handhelds, but, big but here, the 3D is kind of, you know, it motivates me.

214
00:19:43,143 --> 00:19:46,846
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something I'm only going to get on a handheld that I'm not going to get on a TV.

215
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:51,909
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sold enough where I will probably pick one of these up when it comes out.

216
00:19:51,989 --> 00:19:56,473
[SPEAKER_00]: If for nothing else, there's a freaking Kid Icarus game coming out on it, probably a launch.

217
00:19:58,418 --> 00:20:01,003
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really going to have the games to back it up at the end of the day.

218
00:20:01,403 --> 00:20:04,228
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the 3D thing becomes too gimmicky, eh, turn it off.

219
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:04,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?

220
00:20:05,834 --> 00:20:12,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I think that was a brilliant move on Nintendo's part to be able to downgrade your 3D to just straight up 2D.

221
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:21,327
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming they'll require it of every game that comes out for it, but I think Nintendo played this one really well.

222
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:33,278
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be interested in seeing what they've held back from E3 about this system beyond the price and the release date, because you know there's something about it that they're just not telling us

223
00:20:34,697 --> 00:20:37,238
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to hear a little more about the whole Wi-Fi.

224
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:43,379
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they mentioned during the press conference it seemed like it could kind of be off and in your pocket, but it was still communicating.

225
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,560
[SPEAKER_00]: But doesn't the DS kind of do that?

226
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,681
[SPEAKER_00]: Except, oh, you have to have a game on, but you can have the lid shut.

227
00:20:49,161 --> 00:20:56,703
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they're just expanding on that or what they're doing, but I am very curious to kind of hear more about the communications features.

228
00:20:57,318 --> 00:21:02,560
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, I don't think we're going to see this thing until next year, but it'll probably be early next year.

229
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:06,101
[SPEAKER_00]: Japan may have it this holiday, I don't know, but I kind of go back and forth.

230
00:21:06,161 --> 00:21:14,684
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like the system has more development to go, but with all of these games already announced, it seems like, man, they've got a solid year's worth of games already.

231
00:21:15,876 --> 00:21:20,501
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot to mention, there are two things I'm kind of disappointed with it.

232
00:21:21,682 --> 00:21:33,915
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one, the overall design, the look to the system, very DS, and I know it's called the 3DS, I was still hoping that was a working title.

233
00:21:35,436 --> 00:21:37,038
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know.

234
00:21:37,859 --> 00:21:39,221
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had some ADSs now.

235
00:21:39,261 --> 00:21:43,025
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really feel like they should have gone with the same design.

236
00:21:43,425 --> 00:21:47,670
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cases, the metallic cases look very cheap.

237
00:21:48,831 --> 00:21:55,479
[SPEAKER_01]: When I saw it, it reminded me of my Power Rangers from when I was younger, my metallic ones.

238
00:21:56,059 --> 00:21:57,982
[SPEAKER_01]: Same exact sort of coding on it.

239
00:21:58,703 --> 00:22:01,607
[SPEAKER_01]: The second thing that I have a problem with is the D-pad.

240
00:22:02,248 --> 00:22:09,677
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't actually mess with it because there was a playable demo we got, 8-bit Xavius, which we didn't mention.

241
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:11,740
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty cool.

242
00:22:12,781 --> 00:22:39,777
[SPEAKER_01]: and I used the analog stick which was really nice but that d-pad if you're going to make backwards compatible ds games for it the d-pad is in a very awkward position that I don't think would feel right holding while playing but I think it's also important to note that a lot of this is still open change because like you know I remember being here what 04 when the ds first debuted and what they showed on the show floor was a lot different than what the finished prototype was so

243
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:44,903
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have to take that into account with Shane's feedback that a lot of that could change.

244
00:22:45,223 --> 00:22:46,664
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you think of the analog stick, though?

245
00:22:47,085 --> 00:22:50,188
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt a little cheap to me, but again, I have to remember these are prototypes.

246
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,951
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought it was effective.

247
00:22:53,011 --> 00:22:54,993
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually really easy to move around.

248
00:22:55,033 --> 00:22:57,035
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't hurt like the PSP one does.

249
00:22:58,056 --> 00:23:01,300
[SPEAKER_01]: And that comes from the design of the stick.

250
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,202
[SPEAKER_01]: It is concave.

251
00:23:03,755 --> 00:23:03,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?

252
00:23:03,955 --> 00:23:04,495
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the word?

253
00:23:04,555 --> 00:23:05,436
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, concave.

254
00:23:06,856 --> 00:23:09,117
[SPEAKER_01]: So your thumb fits in perfectly.

255
00:23:09,237 --> 00:23:11,437
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not flat like the PSP.

256
00:23:11,817 --> 00:23:20,380
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not rounded like, you know, Nintendo 64 or PlayStation or, well, I guess Xbox isn't, but Xbox just doesn't feel right anyway.

257
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:27,182
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just this big circle of an analog stick that your thumb fits in nicely.

258
00:23:28,123 --> 00:23:30,225
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't really move a lot.

259
00:23:30,245 --> 00:23:34,629
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have a lot of space to move, but it gets the job done and is comfortable.

260
00:23:34,769 --> 00:23:42,456
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, as Nintendo likes to do, they put their form factor on a high priority when designing these things.

261
00:23:44,518 --> 00:23:44,798
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

262
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:49,042
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys have more questions about the 3DS, we'll try to answer whatever we can.

263
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:53,286
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always send your questions to the mailbag, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

264
00:23:54,085 --> 00:24:08,915
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want us to talk about it on Sunday's show, or if you want us to try and get to it tomorrow on the Wednesday night show, www.twitter.com.olr is a great way to get a hold of us during the show.

265
00:24:09,015 --> 00:24:11,376
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been posting tons and tons and tons of pictures today.

266
00:24:11,857 --> 00:24:13,978
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some of the other stuff we observed today.

267
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:21,203
[SPEAKER_00]: Miklatov, tell us a little bit about one of the games we just randomly ended up seeing and getting to spend a little time with.

268
00:24:22,304 --> 00:24:30,892
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as we were walking to get food, I happened to see a booth that had Battlestar Galactica all over it.

269
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:38,098
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remembered, hey, there is a web-based MMO coming out that probably will be awful.

270
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:40,401
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to go see it, of course.

271
00:24:41,181 --> 00:24:41,742
[SPEAKER_01]: We go over there.

272
00:24:42,422 --> 00:24:44,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask the guy if they have time for a little press interview.

273
00:24:45,726 --> 00:24:57,320
[SPEAKER_01]: Gives us a nice room with, I don't have their names with me at the moment, but one of the head guys heading up the Battlestar MMO from Big Point.

274
00:24:58,302 --> 00:24:59,623
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just leave it at bigpoint.com.

275
00:25:01,144 --> 00:25:02,485
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, what he said.

276
00:25:03,886 --> 00:25:12,974
[SPEAKER_01]: And they kind of talked to us about their company and what they were doing with the Battlestar Galactica free web MMO.

277
00:25:13,034 --> 00:25:18,558
[SPEAKER_01]: And they gave us a nice little tour of the pre-alpha is what they were calling it version.

278
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:26,125
[SPEAKER_01]: And holy crap, this might be the first Battlestar Galactica game that I would not feel bad about playing.

279
00:25:26,905 --> 00:25:27,825
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked beautiful.

280
00:25:27,865 --> 00:25:30,106
[SPEAKER_01]: They really captured the essence of the show.

281
00:25:31,506 --> 00:25:37,147
[SPEAKER_01]: They did say they are working with the creative team from Battlestar Galactica on this.

282
00:25:37,707 --> 00:25:39,527
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very joint venture.

283
00:25:41,348 --> 00:25:43,068
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I don't know.

284
00:25:43,528 --> 00:25:45,288
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm interested in playing it.

285
00:25:45,328 --> 00:25:47,449
[SPEAKER_01]: They're shooting for a winter release.

286
00:25:48,389 --> 00:25:53,810
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said that they'd have more details like, you know, cast announcements at Comic-Con, which...

287
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Sucks, because that is next month and not today.

288
00:25:58,013 --> 00:26:00,754
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love more information on this game.

289
00:26:01,735 --> 00:26:09,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, again, what we saw was very, very early, and I kind of went in with a lot of the same skepticism that Shane had about, oh, yay, a web browser-based MMO.

290
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,121
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure this is going to be a real winner.

291
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:16,705
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went in, and we were like, I have to admit, I was kind of like, wow, these graphics.

292
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:17,045
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean,

293
00:26:17,594 --> 00:26:19,674
[SPEAKER_00]: Have I seen better graphics on a PC game?

294
00:26:19,734 --> 00:26:19,994
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

295
00:26:20,315 --> 00:26:26,696
[SPEAKER_00]: But for a web-based, no-download, free MMO, I was like, that's actually pretty darn good.

296
00:26:27,936 --> 00:26:32,277
[SPEAKER_00]: And free is definitely a good price, so I will definitely check out the full version when it comes out.

297
00:26:32,637 --> 00:26:36,558
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not huge on space combat games, but it sounds like there's more to come on this.

298
00:26:36,958 --> 00:26:42,499
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Battlestar enough, and again, just to at least look at the graphics a little bit and see if I can actually steer the ship.

299
00:26:44,607 --> 00:26:47,828
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about... I'll mention this real quick.

300
00:26:48,068 --> 00:26:52,689
[SPEAKER_00]: We did go by Konami's booth for a little bit and saw their dance game that they have on Kinect.

301
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:57,271
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two dance games now for Kinect, and I'm having a hard time telling them apart.

302
00:26:57,311 --> 00:27:05,153
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Dance... Dance Masters is Konami, and then Dance... Dance Central is the Harmonix one.

303
00:27:05,193 --> 00:27:05,453
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

304
00:27:05,693 --> 00:27:09,134
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get to Dance Central in a little bit, but I did look at a little bit of Dance Masters.

305
00:27:11,134 --> 00:27:12,815
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, I think this is where DDR's going.

306
00:27:13,355 --> 00:27:13,575
[SPEAKER_00]: Like,

307
00:27:14,418 --> 00:27:18,540
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, there was a lot of very DDR-ish elements in the game.

308
00:27:19,301 --> 00:27:35,589
[SPEAKER_00]: For those longtime Dance Dance Revolution fans, the song list, at least the few songs they had in this game, you had a Naoki song, you had a SmileDK song, you had a transplant from Para Para Paradise, you know, complete with the same dance, which is making a lot of people compare this game to Para Para Paradise.

309
00:27:36,409 --> 00:27:39,311
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the game might be more accurately compared to Itoi Groove.

310
00:27:39,351 --> 00:27:43,673
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of like you kind of move your hands around and then you pose and all this stuff.

311
00:27:44,864 --> 00:27:55,206
[SPEAKER_00]: which is ironic because Kinect, in a way, the whole thing really feels like what we all thought the eye toy was going to be capable of years ago but just really couldn't pull off technically.

312
00:27:55,826 --> 00:28:00,067
[SPEAKER_00]: But this new technology is allowing it to be a lot more fluid or what have you.

313
00:28:00,487 --> 00:28:02,748
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will say I have not played the game yet.

314
00:28:02,828 --> 00:28:04,668
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to a little later on.

315
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:13,290
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was floored at first because I kind of took a step back and I was like, wow, it even like perfects are in yellow and greats are in green and a lot of the engine and combos.

316
00:28:13,697 --> 00:28:37,346
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, this seems to be, and Naoki was there, he seems to be kind of behind it This might be the direction that DDR is going Funny enough, no DDR on the 360 or PS3 to be found All the DDR that was on the floor was for the Wii So, take that as you will Let's move on to one of the dance games we did play, Dance Central What did you think about this game?

317
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:44,666
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I saw it at the Microsoft press conference on the TV, and I was sold.

318
00:28:45,106 --> 00:28:45,986
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Harmonix.

319
00:28:46,526 --> 00:28:47,667
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be amazing.

320
00:28:47,687 --> 00:28:48,887
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what Harmonix does.

321
00:28:50,127 --> 00:28:54,348
[SPEAKER_01]: But I didn't really understand how great it would be until we actually got to play it today.

322
00:28:55,309 --> 00:29:01,951
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't feel like a video game, and that's probably what makes it so interesting to play.

323
00:29:02,631 --> 00:29:06,612
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a dance teaching game.

324
00:29:07,065 --> 00:29:35,274
[SPEAKER_01]: it's definitely an exercise style game but it's really fun and you start you know when you first play you kind of feel dorky playing it but then you just really get into it and it's it's not one of those games that I would be too embarrassed to play in front of people like you know you might be when you play DDR for a while or when you play any dancing game in the arcade or you know or any rhythm game period

325
00:29:36,784 --> 00:29:42,408
[SPEAKER_01]: I could see this being a great, great teacher for people that want to start to learn to dance.

326
00:29:42,929 --> 00:29:52,555
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that was a genre that was sorely lacking in video games because DDR doesn't teach you to dance.

327
00:29:53,016 --> 00:29:54,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Pump It Up doesn't teach you to dance.

328
00:29:56,098 --> 00:30:02,002
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but the Dance Masters game, it might not be teaching you to dance, but it kind of seemed like... No, no, the other one.

329
00:30:02,042 --> 00:30:03,023
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about the Konami game.

330
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:11,332
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not be teaching you to dance per se, but it definitely kind of looked a lot more like real dance, especially if you were kind of mimicking the dancers on the screen.

331
00:30:11,772 --> 00:30:20,195
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas I think kind of the key difference was that the other game, the Harmonix game, Dance Central, is more about kind of like a choreographed dance that you're learning.

332
00:30:20,595 --> 00:30:24,536
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and you can kind of put together and you learn this very choreographed dance as you go.

333
00:30:25,076 --> 00:30:27,737
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I think this is going to be Kinect's niche.

334
00:30:27,857 --> 00:30:29,737
[SPEAKER_00]: And this should be no surprise to you.

335
00:30:30,157 --> 00:30:32,138
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about this on the show a little while ago.

336
00:30:32,847 --> 00:30:34,267
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

337
00:30:49,651 --> 00:31:04,795
[SPEAKER_00]: As much as it made a lot of us grimace at Microsoft's press conference, I think that's what's going to ultimately get them the most CNN coverage and Oprah coverage and start to kind of nip at the heels of what Nintendo's doing because of the fact that it's just a camera.

338
00:31:06,795 --> 00:31:09,716
[SPEAKER_01]: and this could be something they start implementing in schools too.

339
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:21,121
[SPEAKER_01]: They would only have to buy one thing for it besides the system and that's an investment that they could easily tailor towards the kids for their physical activities.

340
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:30,565
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say I was pleasantly surprised at how responsive the game was and you could kind of see the silhouette of yourself and it didn't look like a lot of stray pixels were getting in there.

341
00:31:31,425 --> 00:31:36,367
[SPEAKER_00]: The lighting where we were at was even a little bit dark although we did have a clear background so

342
00:31:37,476 --> 00:31:38,916
[SPEAKER_00]: My interest is definitely peaked.

343
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:42,757
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to see how this plays out as well in my living room.

344
00:31:43,158 --> 00:31:45,938
[SPEAKER_00]: Although my living room might be a little cramped for Dance Central, I don't know.

345
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:57,141
[SPEAKER_00]: It was interesting to look at, I gotta say, and actually play and to get up there and dance to Poker Face and then actually get a five star on the song.

346
00:31:57,756 --> 00:32:07,924
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when I didn't really know what I was doing, but it kinda showed me enough where, you know, having played enough rhythm games before, I was kinda able to get the hang of it real quick.

347
00:32:08,104 --> 00:32:08,484
[SPEAKER_00]: It was cool.

348
00:32:09,205 --> 00:32:09,846
[SPEAKER_00]: How about Rock Band 3?

349
00:32:10,266 --> 00:32:11,287
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us a little bit about Rock Band 3.

350
00:32:13,327 --> 00:32:14,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Rock Band 3 was cool.

351
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:17,971
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Rock Band.

352
00:32:18,431 --> 00:32:26,917
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to play guitar, so I was playing the same instrument we've played for the past two games.

353
00:32:27,778 --> 00:32:33,242
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing very exciting for me personally when we did the demo.

354
00:32:33,717 --> 00:32:37,919
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cool to have so many people on our little stage, though, all playing together.

355
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,480
[SPEAKER_01]: That was probably the best part for me.

356
00:32:42,221 --> 00:32:43,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and the guitar was blue.

357
00:32:44,161 --> 00:32:46,322
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I was very happy about that.

358
00:32:47,483 --> 00:32:53,205
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, you got to play the keyboards, and I didn't get to really mess with those.

359
00:32:53,345 --> 00:32:58,748
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the most important part about Rock Band 3 from the demo, so I will give it back to you.

360
00:32:59,848 --> 00:33:00,810
[SPEAKER_00]: The keyboards were cool.

361
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:05,896
[SPEAKER_00]: I did misstate something in an earlier program that we learned a little more about today.

362
00:33:06,516 --> 00:33:12,583
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're playing in five bar mode, the keyboard is not split into five different sections as it looks like it is.

363
00:33:13,164 --> 00:33:15,647
[SPEAKER_00]: That is for the pro mode basically only.

364
00:33:15,867 --> 00:33:16,728
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure why.

365
00:33:16,808 --> 00:33:19,612
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why it kind of sections it off the way it does.

366
00:33:19,972 --> 00:33:20,132
[SPEAKER_00]: ProModes

367
00:33:42,657 --> 00:34:01,123
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I don't know anything about playing the guitar but watching that guy in the demo was playing that White Stripes song and like I think at one point they kind of like double jacked him so that he was in the Xbox 360 and he was in an amp and he was playing like the real song that was really cool what he was doing was going above my head because I know nothing about playing the guitar

368
00:34:01,894 --> 00:34:07,101
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do know how to play, at least I did when I was a little kid, the piano or keyboard.

369
00:34:07,501 --> 00:34:12,928
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really exciting that I could probably learn the quote-unquote real songs.

370
00:34:14,366 --> 00:34:18,628
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like the fact that they confirmed today that there will be a Pro Mode for bass.

371
00:34:19,648 --> 00:34:32,333
[SPEAKER_01]: It had been rumored that Pro Mode was coming to the guitar, the drums, and the keyboards, but they were skipping out on bass because bass gets so little love from anybody, it seems.

372
00:34:33,994 --> 00:34:40,216
[SPEAKER_01]: And the new Pro instruments, I don't think that's what they're called, but that's what I'm calling them, with the $150 guitar and whatnot.

373
00:34:42,637 --> 00:34:43,618
[SPEAKER_01]: That was amazing.

374
00:34:44,078 --> 00:34:52,644
[SPEAKER_01]: That is definitely taking their music games and setting it apart from anything else anybody's doing.

375
00:34:54,766 --> 00:35:01,851
[SPEAKER_01]: They're investing so much into this genre that we can only respect them for it, I think.

376
00:35:03,479 --> 00:35:08,924
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like they're making a lot of very interesting changes with the single player mode too that I'm kind of curious to see how that plays out.

377
00:35:09,825 --> 00:35:12,047
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't give us a lot of details on all that today.

378
00:35:12,087 --> 00:35:20,294
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of talked about it, but it seems like they're going to trickle a little more and a little more kind of up to the release of the game, including more info on the character creation mode and so forth.

379
00:35:20,694 --> 00:35:25,659
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will say this, it was great to hear that pretty much everything is backwards compatible.

380
00:35:26,161 --> 00:35:28,703
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the Beatles, but I think everybody pretty much expected that.

381
00:35:28,743 --> 00:35:31,206
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the Lego Rock Band, everything could come in.

382
00:35:31,226 --> 00:35:33,328
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a whole new way for you to pick songs.

383
00:35:33,708 --> 00:35:35,369
[SPEAKER_00]: That includes filtering your list.

384
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:40,854
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you just want to look at, you know, Lego songs or you want to look at songs with a certain difficulty, it seems to be a lot more fluid.

385
00:35:40,874 --> 00:35:47,400
[SPEAKER_00]: They made a lot of improvements to the interface, including, you know, people kind of jumping in and out and having quicker play sessions.

386
00:35:48,762 --> 00:35:52,485
[SPEAKER_00]: I was pretty enticed by what they're doing with the setup there.

387
00:35:53,396 --> 00:35:55,177
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, I'm really losing my voice, guys.

388
00:35:55,517 --> 00:36:01,560
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so sorry, but I do want to at least try to talk a little bit with you guys about what we saw today.

389
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:07,222
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were pretty much the games we spent real quality time with.

390
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:14,545
[SPEAKER_00]: Really got to sit down and play extensively, but we kind of got to look over shoulders and kind of see some other games.

391
00:36:14,586 --> 00:36:17,787
[SPEAKER_00]: I quickly saw the OnLive system.

392
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:23,952
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, if that is really streaming in that little box, that looks a lot better than I anticipated.

393
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:29,374
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Bobby's going to spend some time with that, so maybe when he's here tomorrow, he'll tell us a little more about that.

394
00:36:30,014 --> 00:36:32,495
[SPEAKER_00]: I did see the Tron games, which look kind of cool.

395
00:36:32,916 --> 00:36:40,398
[SPEAKER_00]: The one I was looking at was a Wii bike, or like a bike, the light cycles thing on the Wii, but it looked like there was a 360 one too.

396
00:36:40,438 --> 00:36:42,259
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really get to get close enough with.

397
00:36:42,299 --> 00:36:44,300
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully tomorrow I'll get to get in there a little closer.

398
00:36:45,172 --> 00:36:47,876
[SPEAKER_00]: to see a little bit of Dead Rising 2, which kind of looked exciting.

399
00:36:49,038 --> 00:36:56,228
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping tomorrow I can look at Sony Move and actually get my hands on it so I can feel like I'm speaking the Sony side a little more with authority.

400
00:36:56,248 --> 00:36:59,233
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, anything that just kind of caught your eye as we were walking around?

401
00:37:01,027 --> 00:37:03,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I will actually go to the opposite of that.

402
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:10,416
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say what did not catch my eye, which would be games that I expected to be there and didn't actually show.

403
00:37:11,457 --> 00:37:15,561
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite disappointed that Nintendo did not bring the new Pokemon games here.

404
00:37:15,921 --> 00:37:22,448
[SPEAKER_01]: They did have one on Wii, and they did have a Pokemon Ranger for DS, but no black and white.

405
00:37:23,148 --> 00:37:31,795
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping that's because they will switch it up and instead of it being a DS game, they bring it to the 3DS.

406
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:35,258
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I assume we'll get the 3DS by...

407
00:37:35,988 --> 00:37:39,651
[SPEAKER_01]: Our release date of Spring 2011 for Pokemon.

408
00:37:41,113 --> 00:37:45,156
[SPEAKER_01]: I was very disappointed with walking through EA and not seeing Dragon Age 2.

409
00:37:45,977 --> 00:37:53,503
[SPEAKER_01]: They have already set a teaser release date for it, so I don't see why they couldn't have at least shown it in video form.

410
00:37:53,703 --> 00:37:55,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it was behind closed doors.

411
00:37:56,245 --> 00:38:00,049
[SPEAKER_01]: Konami, not having a Silent Hill up there to show.

412
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,550
[SPEAKER_01]: That was very, very upsetting.

413
00:38:02,871 --> 00:38:14,159
[SPEAKER_01]: However, they kind of countered it with having a Glee karaoke revolution, which I will hopefully be playing tomorrow because I love me some Glee.

414
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:21,604
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of one of those things where when I saw it, I kind of rolled my eyes and said, how did I not see that one coming?

415
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:32,702
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, was it just today we were talking about how come nobody picked up a Glee license before we got to Konami and then it was there?

416
00:38:33,362 --> 00:38:33,902
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what it was?

417
00:38:33,942 --> 00:38:36,323
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody was making a joke like at Ubisoft's press conference.

418
00:38:36,343 --> 00:38:41,424
[SPEAKER_00]: I think somebody had said something like, oh, gee, it's so funny that Ubisoft didn't roll out like a Glee game.

419
00:38:41,464 --> 00:38:47,306
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why they're... Yeah, yeah, you said that and then suddenly we're at Konami's booth and, oh, well, they have the license for the Glee game apparently.

420
00:38:48,379 --> 00:38:57,241
[SPEAKER_01]: but I mean it makes sense now they rebooted the karaoke franchise by dropping American Idol and instead they're picking up yet another Fox show.

421
00:38:57,821 --> 00:39:02,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can't Dance Masters be So You Think You Can Dance Masters or something like that?

422
00:39:04,163 --> 00:39:07,264
[SPEAKER_01]: I think these tie-ins would go great for Konami.

423
00:39:07,364 --> 00:39:12,205
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of hope they start doing a little bit better and quit putting out some crap titles.

424
00:39:14,046 --> 00:39:16,107
[SPEAKER_01]: What else caught my eye while we were walking around?

425
00:39:16,868 --> 00:39:20,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I didn't see Child of Eden at Ubisoft.

426
00:39:20,471 --> 00:39:29,677
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really hoping for that, especially now hearing that you don't need the Move Controller, you don't need the Kinect camera to play.

427
00:39:29,757 --> 00:39:36,622
[SPEAKER_01]: They are going to let you use the regular controls, so not having a demo up or anything was kind of depressing.

428
00:39:39,224 --> 00:39:41,646
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think... I didn't really get to see much.

429
00:39:41,686 --> 00:39:44,127
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we completely skipped over Namco today.

430
00:39:46,169 --> 00:39:47,990
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to try to find Valve if Valve is around.

431
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:48,810
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to play Portal.

432
00:39:49,931 --> 00:39:52,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Disappointed that Activision thinks they're too good for a booth.

433
00:39:52,753 --> 00:39:54,194
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think Portal's on the show floor.

434
00:39:55,621 --> 00:40:01,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm sad that Valve thinks they're too good for a booth.

435
00:40:02,206 --> 00:40:13,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a very much scaled down version of the E3 I'm used to, so little disappointments here and there, but at the same time there's been some really cool stuff just from the first day.

436
00:40:15,069 --> 00:40:16,550
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's really scaled down.

437
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:18,512
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is kind of like the just right size.

438
00:40:18,552 --> 00:40:20,434
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 2006 was too much.

439
00:40:20,514 --> 00:40:33,406
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this year is, you know, and with last year, even though what was being shown to me wasn't as impressive last year because everything was still a concept last year, I'm relatively happy with the way this year is going so far.

440
00:40:34,355 --> 00:40:41,361
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be happy if Kentia Hall was back and had all the really crappy games and the really awesome games that nobody cares about.

441
00:40:43,022 --> 00:40:44,504
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I don't know.

442
00:40:45,304 --> 00:40:51,690
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of miss the old big spectacle E3 just because it was so neat.

443
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:54,452
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, it still feels like a spectacle.

444
00:40:56,151 --> 00:40:56,811
[SPEAKER_00]: Skeptical?

445
00:40:56,891 --> 00:40:58,032
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I saying?

446
00:40:58,452 --> 00:41:00,692
[SPEAKER_00]: God, it still feels like a big spectacle to me, Shane.

447
00:41:00,732 --> 00:41:01,813
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

448
00:41:02,853 --> 00:41:04,473
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been many of these now.

449
00:41:05,354 --> 00:41:11,455
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it would feel like a big spectacle to me if we didn't have to wait in line for half the day.

450
00:41:12,816 --> 00:41:13,056
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

451
00:41:14,516 --> 00:41:15,336
[SPEAKER_00]: And one other thing.

452
00:41:15,596 --> 00:41:21,278
[SPEAKER_00]: It is still very disappointing just how much of the show is still...

453
00:41:22,108 --> 00:41:29,914
[SPEAKER_00]: Make an appointment, or only special people can get in here, and everything's behind these walls and so forth.

454
00:41:29,974 --> 00:41:37,699
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like, I don't know, to a lot of people who do, you know, fly out to be here and all that stuff, it's just kind of like, it's a big disappointment.

455
00:41:39,293 --> 00:41:42,256
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're going to do stuff like that, they need to make it media only.

456
00:41:42,336 --> 00:41:49,982
[SPEAKER_01]: I see people with exhibits only badges or even the people that are exhibitors.

457
00:41:50,162 --> 00:41:52,785
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't get to all the stuff that's behind closed doors.

458
00:41:52,865 --> 00:41:55,006
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just media that have appointments.

459
00:41:56,908 --> 00:41:58,389
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see what the point of that is.

460
00:41:58,489 --> 00:42:02,633
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not getting your product out to everybody that you possibly can.

461
00:42:03,574 --> 00:42:05,415
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just dumb to me by far.

462
00:42:06,676 --> 00:42:07,217
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't...

463
00:42:08,522 --> 00:42:36,381
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really care who is the super special club or what have you I just don't think it should be so out in everyone else's faces that like you know oh these people are coming back here but you're not you know type of thing like that's why they have meeting rooms in these other places you know use the booth space to show those things you want to show out in the open and have more places for people to walk around so that the show doesn't feel as cramped even though there's less people here I think that's kind of really the point I'm trying to get to is that just don't be so

464
00:42:37,595 --> 00:42:38,396
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on.

465
00:43:00,791 --> 00:43:06,713
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back to 2006, I think there was a lot of that in 2006, too, which caused that show floor to just be packed.

466
00:43:06,953 --> 00:43:08,634
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's no place for people to go.

467
00:43:09,514 --> 00:43:17,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotta say, though, that the stuff I've seen that's closed for, you know, appointments that have already been made, mostly stuff I don't care about.

468
00:43:17,938 --> 00:43:20,179
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not too bummed about it.

469
00:43:20,219 --> 00:43:24,500
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that kind of got me sad was Final Fantasy XIV being closed off.

470
00:43:25,821 --> 00:43:28,722
[SPEAKER_01]: But hey, we have an appointment for it, so it's all good.

471
00:43:30,256 --> 00:43:34,077
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, yeah, so we'll be bringing you more information on that coming on Thursday.

472
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,798
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, we're just going to start to wrap up for tonight because it's getting very late.

473
00:43:37,818 --> 00:43:38,959
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably after 1 a.m.

474
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:46,621
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to ask us questions or give any feedback, twitter.com slash OLR is really the place to get to us over the next few days.

475
00:43:46,641 --> 00:43:49,862
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing you're most looking forward to seeing tomorrow, Shane?

476
00:43:51,551 --> 00:43:53,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that is not where I thought you were going with that.

477
00:43:55,815 --> 00:43:56,115
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

478
00:43:56,635 --> 00:43:58,097
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily a thing.

479
00:43:58,657 --> 00:44:03,181
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm really interested in hanging out and spending some time with the Sega booth.

480
00:44:04,222 --> 00:44:05,783
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see the new Sonic games.

481
00:44:06,303 --> 00:44:08,925
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see the localized Phantasy Star Portable.

482
00:44:10,207 --> 00:44:16,572
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though Bobby said it was terrible, I would love to see the monkey ball on the iPad and see how awful it is.

483
00:44:18,361 --> 00:44:21,925
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to just getting some hands-on time with the PlayStation Move hopefully.

484
00:44:22,145 --> 00:44:27,671
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to kind of go in and give that a try because I'm hearing a lot about how it feels a little more accurate than the Wii does.

485
00:44:29,713 --> 00:44:37,821
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the press conference goes, I wasn't hearing about a lot of games that I feel like I need to get, but I'd be curious to go get my hands on it and see if it changes my mind.

486
00:44:37,901 --> 00:44:40,164
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's one of the top things I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

487
00:44:41,187 --> 00:45:09,943
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it might be worth braving the Nintendo booth again tomorrow to maybe see Zelda, because I don't know what the videos are like online, but that game was running flawlessly, it looked 60 frames a second, it was beautiful, and I would like to try Kirby Epic Yarn or whatever it's called, and the Donkey Kong Country game, because that is amazing looking, it looks just like Donkey Kong Country and sounds like Donkey Kong Country.

488
00:45:11,084 --> 00:45:16,528
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so yeah, tomorrow we're going to really try to not stand in as many lines and just play as many games as possible.

489
00:45:17,149 --> 00:45:24,614
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see what we can do and we'll be back tomorrow with Bobby will be here with us and thank you for sitting through our special.

490
00:45:24,654 --> 00:45:36,804
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a lot different than a regular edition of Orange Lounge Radio but again, we kind of want to get all that out there while we're still thinking about it and of course I'll be joined with DarkSakura and Loki again live this Sunday on Orange Lounge Radio.

491
00:45:36,844 --> 00:45:39,926
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be talking about a lot of this same stuff

492
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:47,359
[SPEAKER_00]: but, you know, Loki and DarkSakura kind of have a different point of observation and then, of course, you guys in chat and all that other stuff.

493
00:45:47,399 --> 00:45:49,164
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a fun show on Sunday.

494
00:45:50,243 --> 00:46:00,012
[SPEAKER_01]: I also think it would be great if we get some suggestions for things to see on Thursday because we won't be able to read them, I'm sure, tomorrow in time for when we go.

495
00:46:00,673 --> 00:46:10,462
[SPEAKER_01]: But our Thursday is pretty open except for Final Fantasy, so maybe there's something that some people would like to hear about that we may have accidentally skipped.

496
00:46:12,142 --> 00:46:12,723
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

497
00:46:12,823 --> 00:46:16,086
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, again, contact us at twitter.com slash OLR.

498
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,488
[SPEAKER_00]: You can try to send us emails too.

499
00:46:17,528 --> 00:46:21,232
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't guarantee we can get those as fast because we can do the Twitter thing right there on my phone.

500
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:22,133
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy.

501
00:46:22,593 --> 00:46:23,935
[SPEAKER_00]: So okay, that's it.

502
00:46:23,955 --> 00:46:24,876
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to wrap up for tonight.

503
00:46:25,056 --> 00:46:26,157
[SPEAKER_00]: It's well after 1 a.m.

504
00:46:26,297 --> 00:46:28,039
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to upload this and go to bed.

505
00:46:28,179 --> 00:46:32,644
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Rob Roberts at E3, Orange Lounge Special Edition.

506
00:46:33,245 --> 00:46:33,465
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

507
00:46:33,505 --> 00:46:34,246
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great night, everybody.
