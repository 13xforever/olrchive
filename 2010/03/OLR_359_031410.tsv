14513	19857	Tonight, March 14th, 2010, Sony details this new motion controller at GDC.
20338	26123	OnLive promises streaming games for a monthly fee, and soon you can get Xbox achievements on your cell phones.
31806	39853	Hello, my friends, and welcome to episode number 359 of Orange Lounge Radio, the video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.
39993	45837	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
46458	46818	Woo.
47118	47719	How are you doing?
47999	48279	Woo.
48620	48940	Woo.
49380	50601	That sounds good.
50621	50962	Woo.
51102	51542	Woo.
51802	53403	Not like woo, but woo.
53864	55085	Like a Ric Flair kind of woo.
55265	55565	All right.
55725	58087	Also joining us, say hello to TechMasterLoki.
59229	67454	Who I noticed is eating BBQ chicken Yes, so I have to be sure that I'm not getting chicken At least he has chicken Woo!
67554	68855	And BBQ chicken gets a woo?
69776	78301	Sure, I'm almost out of root beer and that's not good I got him to put no ice this time so it doesn't water down with that useless frozen water
78661	81342	Yet no one is eating pie, and today is pie day.
81402	83323	Happy pie day to all of our listeners.
83703	84443	I had a donut.
84983	85803	I don't know if that counts.
86023	87924	Actually, I did have something kind of pie-like.
88164	88484	Okay.
88504	89905	Pie-like.
90385	98447	I went to Charlie's Cafe and had the banana cream pie waffle.
98888	100008	They put pie filling on the waffle.
100328	101389	Oh, that's kind of strange.
101409	102049	It's delicious.
102230	103330	And they put chocolate chips on it too.
103350	104812	That's like dessert for breakfast.
105032	105592	I know, it was great.
105612	107494	You know how some people eat breakfast for dinner?
107674	111837	But like, I didn't really eat anything like for five hours after that.
112237	116821	Because it was like full of waffle, waffley pie goodness.
116881	117782	Waffle and pie.
117882	119583	I can think of no two better foods.
120323	121905	Unless there was bacon somehow involved too.
121965	122045	Yeah.
123746	124306	This is funny.
124606	124746	What?
124786	126827	I keep messing with Cheeseburger in the chat room.
128387	129147	He asked me.
130348	131228	I don't know why.
131368	131988	It's just funny.
132728	133008	All right.
133468	133909	You want to get it?
134009	141470	Yeah, well, he was asking me what my email address was, so I'm like, no, you had me confused with the other Loki, just, you know, because there is no other Loki in chat.
142511	146912	And so I just... And so he's really confused.
146932	149012	Yeah, but now if he's listening to the show, he's going to know you're messing with him.
149232	149432	So?
149873	150113	All right.
150653	151013	I'm done.
151773	158135	Well, if you want to join our chat room and get messed with, too, we do tape live every week at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
158215	158736	It's 6 Pacific.
158756	163397	A big thank you to them for letting us deal their bandwidth every week, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, of course.
164518	168899	Daylight savings happened today, by the way, so we might be on, I think, let's see, We Sprang Forward.
168939	172420	So those that didn't celebrate it, we would have sprung backwards for them.
172941	179263	Anyhow, if you are listening to us live, pull up a chair and join us in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to be.
180363	187225	We're going to get into some gaming news here in a little bit, but we always start off, just as we have for the past several years, talking about how was your gaming week?
187365	189606	And DarkSakura, what kind of video games have you been playing this week?
190106	190706	Atari.
191346	191606	Yeah?
192566	193787	I played Gorf.
195387	197128	And I played Tempest 3000.
197268	198068	I played Tempest 2000.
198468	202649	I played... I'll just go ahead and say it.
202689	204910	I played Space Harrier on the Atari XL.
204930	205950	A beta.
206210	206530	A beta.
207509	207889	Interesting.
207929	210269	Is it like a new thing or like a prototype that never happened?
210790	211310	It's a new thing.
211630	213590	It's in development right now.
213630	214610	I met the guy who did the soundtrack.
214910	215290	Oh, very cool.
215310	216531	Pretty cool.
218211	219851	I played... What else did I play?
219951	225912	I played Centipede on the Atari XL with a remapped trackball.
226812	227432	Played a little Peggle.
228373	231673	Played a lot of... Actually, not really a whole lot of Star Trek Online.
232333	233673	I did like a battle.
234614	234794	And...
239133	239433	Yeah.
239453	244395	Alright, we'll come back to DarkSakura a little later about all the Atari stuff.
244656	250398	Dan actually got Gradius, the Gradius thing for Wii.
251879	252919	The Gradius Rebirth.
252979	253260	Yeah.
253280	254180	The redone Gradius.
254400	257842	Yeah, and so it was fun watching him cuss at the Moai heads.
260143	262004	You know, I bought that, but I didn't really play enough of it.
262064	263824	I got distracted with something else that was going on that week.
263844	264385	It's anger-inducing.
264985	265625	Of course, of course.
266366	267246	Loki, how was your gaming week?
270037	273322	Well, not too eventful.
273383	279212	I played Final Fantasy XIII, and I'm maybe like six hours into it.
281105	307135	and played more Grand Theft Auto and actually part of the week our internet was down at work or our network in the room that we have the 360s in so we ended up playing some old school Saints Row 1 deathmatch multiplayer so that was fun because you can do system link on those and they don't require Xbox Live.
308735	312496	Um, and then I did check out the demo for Just Cause 2.
313376	314037	It's pretty fun.
314417	315877	Not as fun as I would hoped.
316497	318898	Um, but I think I'd like it.
319298	323459	It's kind of got that, um, Mercenaries 2 vibe to it.
323519	326420	I mean, it's very similar, obviously, to the first Just Cause game.
326920	328901	But, um, thankfully it is...
330702	334345	Well, very much higher production value than Mercenaries 2.
334386	341592	I mean, that game was glitched out every which way possible, so.
342133	344675	I did finish downloading the Blur multiplayer beta.
344695	348539	I haven't played it yet, though, so that'll be pretty fun.
349180	354425	They're supposed to be adding some more codes for that, so hopefully I'll be able to give you one, Rob, so.
355174	356095	Oh, I got one.
356456	357417	I'm in the same boat you are.
357457	358579	I had so much other stuff going on.
358959	363005	And I was really excited about Blur, too, but I keep... I'll get into it in a minute.
366761	369042	So yeah, I think that's really all I played this week.
369322	381665	I tried going back to play some more Borderlands, but since I've been modding the hell out of it, I finally downloaded the patch that's supposed to get rid of all that stuff, and it kind of jacked up my game.
381765	392548	Like, now it won't load my save game correctly, and it's not a big deal because I don't really care about the progress in the game or my level or whatever because I've been cheating anyways.
393389	394029	It's just that...
395029	398690	I don't have to go do all those quests again because it's a lot of just running around.
400071	400751	It's really annoying.
401311	404713	So I have to go through and get to be fixed again.
405913	407094	And then I'll cheat again.
408034	415177	Oh, by the way, I am also cheating through Final Fantasy XIII because you can edit the save games to do all sorts of crazy stuff.
415457	418178	If you can cheat it or hack it or crack it, Loki's probably done it.
419127	424957	By the way, speaking of hacking and cheating I think Dan wants to talk to you about something related to a Japanese Xbox game.
425679	425899	Okay.
427201	427462	Awesome.
428726	432087	Anyhow, if that's it for Loki's Gaming Week, then I'll go ahead.
432387	442751	My Gaming Week, yeah, like Loki said, I got into the Blur Beta, but sadly I've just been so into Final Fantasy XIII that all of my gaming time has been sucked into Final Fantasy XIII.
443031	450894	I'm about 16 hours in at this point, and I get the sense I am right before something epic that's going to happen in the story.
451414	453154	Again, I'm not going to give out spoilers.
453355	453855	I am very...
454855	455615	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
477463	478123	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
504214	509457	I think a lot of people played through the first three hours and there's definitely your characters that are likable and dislikable.
509957	517280	But the thing that was mentioned last week, the game is like a banana that slowly peels back to reveal all of its layers.
517340	520382	Or maybe like an everlasting gobstopper because it takes so long to get through.
520882	522342	And there's all these different colored layers.
522703	526985	You definitely start to see that there is more to the story than what you saw in the first few hours.
527125	528045	It's very interesting.
528065	531787	I do like the weapon upgrade system because I was wondering what all those components were for.
531807	531907	Yeah.
532607	542499	I thought it was going to be more of like crafting though, instead of like, okay, these components equal X number of experience and your levels go up and the weapon does more damage or whatever.
544150	544990	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
568280	570002	I want to get into it because it's pretty big.
570022	576147	I'm just wondering if we kill the cyber pope because, you know, he looks like he has it coming.
577848	581752	My favorite character, though, I think is still Saz because he does have a chocobo that lives in his hair.
581852	586996	And the chocobo gets a little more personality as the story goes on and it's disgustingly cute.
587236	588077	Disgustingly cute.
588697	592841	And I was going to say that the Shiva sister's
594730	596672	Their motorcycle is naughty.
597372	605758	I am so happy that Final Fantasy has gone back to this just epic, over-the-top summons thing in the game.
606919	611022	Back to Final Fantasy VII where it was like Knights of the Round and all this...
612043	613364	Well, yeah, 10 had it too.
613444	614064	It did, it did.
614084	614944	There was one.
614964	619406	10 did have the Shiva that would come out and snap her fingers, boop, and then the ice would shatter everywhere.
619666	620786	It's nice to see that again.
620826	625428	There was one part, though, of the game that I didn't like, so, I mean, it was kind of annoying, thankfully.
625448	630450	It was a really short section of the game, but, you know, they kind of tried to change the gameplay up a little bit.
630530	638213	When you get that little mech thing that you walk around in for about five, not even five minutes, like two minutes, that was a waste of time.
638723	643287	I can see why some people are kind of on Final Fantasy XIII because it does change things up a lot.
643387	649753	And yeah, you don't really go out into this world map and go to towns and stuff like you do in a Final Fantasy game.
649773	650934	But you didn't in X either.
651095	655759	If you think about it, remember, it was just the airship in different spots that you could kind of drop down into.
656159	658280	A lot of these next-gen games are kind of like that too.
658340	659081	Lost Odyssey.
659561	667686	There's a lot I see besides the battle systems are completely different, but the way you move around the map and everything is very similar to Lost Odyssey.
667726	676811	You have these relatively linear dungeons with different branches and so forth, but Lost Odyssey didn't get a lot of crap, but clearly Final Fantasy XIII is.
676831	680853	People just have an idea of what they think Final Fantasy should be, and if it's not that
680953	681834	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
694389	716620	TigerClaw in our chatroom, chat.orangelandreda.com says Sky, he would have to wash his hair every day though to clean out all the Chocobo poo I do want to point out that Chocobo is capable of flying out of the hair and you do see that happening so he hopefully is potty trained to fly out of the hair and go to a nearby tree or something they don't really get into that and normally animals don't poop where they sleep, you know
717301	723268	Just like... You know, there's just some cases where you don't have to explain the bathroom thing.
723308	724930	Like, take 24, for example.
725831	731758	On the show 24, it's so fast-paced and action-paced, you don't ever stop to really think, when do these characters have time to poo?
732438	734100	When they're not showing them, you know?
734160	736463	It's just like, when it goes to some other character.
737444	750947	but these are things you don't think about because 24 is so action packed and there's so much going on you're not supposed to be thinking about gee I wonder if Jack's gotta go anyhow are all the scenes always focused on him?
751946	752326	What's that?
752586	754247	Are all the scenes always focused on him?
754267	754727	No, they're not.
754827	760309	So then he pees when... Well, he's usually in situations where it's not like there's a bathroom nearby.
760449	761709	Depends, Rob, depends.
761729	763370	When he's tied to a chair getting tortured.
763410	763810	Depends.
764210	764770	All right, forget it.
764810	769012	Although that would be awesome to spend a whole episode based on him trying to find a bathroom.
769052	770732	No, it would not be awesome, actually.
770752	771092	Yes, it would.
771112	773113	Well, it's being canceled, so oh well.
773753	776994	No, NBC might buy it now that they have five hours available on weeknights.
777455	778455	That's the rumor anyway.
779621	788128	24 is a great show, although it's one of those shows where it's like, I missed an episode, so now I can't watch any of it, because you miss one, you miss everything.
788168	789789	It's like Lost.
789829	792271	People just obsess with Lost, and I get why.
792932	793753	There's a lot to it.
796995	799857	Again, if you missed that first episode, I think you're just lost.
800618	800898	Period.
801959	802179	Anyhow.
803860	808621	Yeah, just like Brad from PodCulture said, he pees during the commercial break, just like everybody else does.
809902	812582	Liquid Parrot in chatroom asks, I'm playing Final Fantasy XIII now.
812642	815263	I'm getting five stars after every battle, but what's the point?
815703	817343	Is there even EXP in this game?
817704	823585	There is not EXP, but there's crystal points that let you move around the board, similar to Final Fantasy X's level-up system.
825165	827646	The stars, I believe, affect your loot.
828286	830606	You can sometimes get loot affected by the stars.
830906	838768	I think more importantly, your Technic points, which I don't know if you're to the point in the game where you're using those yet, but they allow you to cast spells like Libra.
839668	842369	You will see how that comes into play if you're not already there.
842469	845490	The star ratings affect how fast your bar fills up for Technic points.
846290	846710	So there you go.
848070	849792	Anyhow, other games.
850072	851012	I think I mentioned WoW.
851052	851873	I'm playing Warcraft.
851953	855816	My boyfriend and I made it to Outlands on the characters we've been working on for a couple months, so yay that.
856577	859499	And then Mega Man 10 came out this week on PlayStation.
859799	861200	I didn't play it really a lot.
861320	867505	I just kind of downloaded it and went in and went, ooh, pretty, and well, not really pretty, but retrotastic.
867585	869626	And I went in and watched the replays.
869847	871188	Oddly enough, that was the first thing I did.
871208	875491	I went in to watch replays and watch people just do speedruns on these stages that are insane.
875831	904265	that's kind of a cool thing I don't remember if Mega Man 9 had that if it did I just never looked for it but for some reason that jumped right out at me in this Mega Man 10 and that was one of the first things I did so I need to play that a little more it's nice though that I can watch movies on how to beat stages when I don't know what to do so that was pretty much it for my gaming week let's go to some housekeeping Jamie you went to an event today where you played all these Atari games give us a little wrap up on what this was all about
904750	911212	I went to the Atari Party 2010, which I guess I didn't really know about this before, but apparently they do it every year.
912113	918095	And it was basically this kind of house-like structure in Davis.
918995	921316	It had a kitchen and a big room, but...
922176	924339	They just had Atari systems looked up everywhere.
925099	934871	And I met a man named Sal who... I said I was going to mention his thing, but I put my piece of paper with everything on there.
935792	936412	Mention it next week.
937393	939674	Atlantis Games, I think is what he said it was.
940854	942394	I will definitely make a big mention of it.
943754	945495	It was really cool.
947255	954397	He did soundtracks for a lot of, I guess, new releases or ports of other games.
955277	958237	Or releases of prototypes and other ones.
958537	960558	Right now they're working on Outrun and Space Harrier.
961859	967452	for the Atari XL, which was a computer version of the 5200.
970194	992113	It's funny his company's called Atlantis Games if that was the name because Atlantis was one and I thought I looked it up on Wikipedia real quick just to jog my memory I thought Atlantis was one of those big big Atari 2600 games that was really well loved and yeah there's some screenshots here was that one of those a magic game so it had that very unique looking cartridge with like the orange that was a great 2600 game so I don't know if the company is named an ode to that game or what but
992313	992733	Axel F Axel F
1020319	1024340	and somehow Van Halen's jump usually makes an appearance at some point too.
1024380	1025740	Maybe he didn't do it, but somebody did.
1029501	1039124	At any rate, they also had this is, because keep in mind my brain's kind of fried from being out so long, but they had the DVD game system.
1040344	1044565	You know how some of the DVDs for a while they were doing like a game system hooked up to it.
1044905	1046366	So they had a version of Tempest 3000.
1046426	1046526	What?
1048632	1049573	For the new one, the new one is what it is.
1076866	1077947	Wow.
1078888	1088676	It was a DVD system that had enhanced DVD tools in it and 3D video game playability on it.
1088796	1096382	So only a few things came out on it, but so far I think just Tempest 3000 is the only real notable.
1096903	1099585	But they had one there and had it hooked up.
1100906	1102708	I'll link a picture of it to the chat room, but that's...
1103760	1105061	It looks like an N64 with that controller.
1105161	1106683	That's what I thought it was at first.
1106743	1107544	Wow, that's kind of neat.
1107564	1111668	And so I looked at it and I was like, oh no, that's a new one, yeah.
1113669	1121056	But I played Tempest 3000 and there was actually some video up of Dan playing Tempest 3000 because I recorded stuff with my iPhone.
1121777	1122918	Did you already put it on your YouTube?
1122938	1123839	It's on my YouTube right now.
1123859	1125240	So it's on your YouTube channel.
1125641	1126942	Are you going to give that out publicly or...?
1127322	1129023	Yeah, it's OLR DarkSakura.
1130163	1131504	Or DarkSakura OLR or something.
1131524	1131924	You know it.
1132184	1132804	Can you find it, Rob?
1133185	1133965	Yeah.
1134805	1139587	But it eats a lot of battery.
1140167	1141308	Your DarkSakura OLR.
1141328	1143549	But yeah, I did like a couple of sweeps of the party.
1143949	1147871	And, you know, just, you know, I took a few screens.
1147891	1149051	Hold on, here's Tempest 3000.
1149091	1151512	I want to kind of play this a little bit.
1151572	1152373	You'll hear Dan talking.
1153939	1155321	Who did Tempest 2000?
1156242	1159545	But it plays on the DVD players that have you on.
1163130	1165052	We should have got you to put these on the OLR, YouTube.
1165072	1165572	That's all right.
1166073	1167535	I've got the movie files.
1167555	1168115	You can have them.
1168335	1168736	That's all right.
1169437	1170118	You can copy them.
1172509	1173850	I'm just trying to get a look at the game here.
1174511	1176773	Sorry, I know this doesn't make for great radio, but yeah.
1176953	1177794	It's very blurry.
1177834	1178775	That's the problem with it.
1178815	1187943	If this was on HDTV, it would be a lot better, but that's why I still say I prefer Tempest 2000 to Tempest 3000, because Tempest 3000 gives me a headache.
1189164	1191366	The score is gigantic in the corner.
1192347	1193128	The music's the same.
1194089	1196091	Imagine on HDTV, this would be spectacular.
1198348	1202591	Wow, almost makes me want to see a Nuon get added to the gaming vault.
1203392	1205133	I can't imagine if I could find one.
1205173	1206894	I'm sure they're pretty expensive.
1207855	1208315	Very cool.
1208375	1209096	All right, so sorry.
1209676	1211017	I was not aware of Tempest 3000.
1211077	1215981	I want to say it's one of those things I've heard of before, but I just really haven't seen in motion.
1216121	1218262	I've covered it when I covered Tempest 2000.
1218923	1220364	Yeah, but it's one of those things.
1220924	1224667	Hearing about it and seeing it and playing it are three different things.
1225608	1230995	There were jaguars all over the place in all varieties of Atari systems.
1234248	1256938	It was pretty fun, and I'm actually thinking, I'll find the stuff a little bit later for everybody, but the guy I talked to has an eBay store, and he sells the refurbished Excels for like 70 bucks, which isn't bad, because they're all set up to work with S-Video.
1258338	1263181	So, um, and, you know, he sells most of the cartridges that they do for like 30 bucks.
1263201	1265423	Because, I mean, it is, you know, time and effort went into it.
1265443	1268085	It is pretty much a new version of the game.
1268145	1269986	Except he did Tempest Extreme.
1270046	1271227	Well, they did Tempest Extreme.
1271967	1279052	That, because of how much work and everything that went into getting it to run properly, it's actually a 50 buck game.
1279612	1283155	But, I've seen it in motion, played it, well worth it.
1283975	1285276	So, it was pretty good.
1285970	1287030	All right, the Atari Party.
1287351	1288311	A little local event.
1288371	1288751	Sounds like fun.
1288791	1290992	And someone had a PlayStation there, and I was like, hey!
1292673	1293633	You're at the Atari Party.
1293853	1296214	Well, were they playing the Atari Collection maybe on the PlayStation?
1296254	1297035	That might be acceptable.
1297055	1297475	I don't know.
1297515	1299656	I just heard the little PlayStation chime.
1300216	1302217	And I was like, hey, that doesn't belong here.
1303277	1303958	You get that out.
1303998	1304458	Traitor!
1305058	1305758	You get that out.
1306359	1308600	Oh, and they also had one of the...
1309580	1319790	Now, you know, I ran into Neil there, and I didn't get to see it, because I was talking to the XL, the guy, Sal, we were talking about the music and everything.
1319930	1327877	By the way, since I don't think Neil's ever been on this program, he's an old buddy of mine from, like, junior high school, we've known each other a very long time, and so he goes to some of these nerd things, too.
1328418	1332362	Yeah, he also does Rocky, a big part of that, and is a big nerd, so...
1332833	1332973	Wow.
1332993	1333993	So, that's pretty cool.
1362409	1363911	Lots of retro love.
1364071	1366394	People still making new games on old systems.
1366494	1367034	It's kind of funny.
1367255	1370198	And yes, Amiga 777, it was a Jaguar.
1370218	1371700	Someone had a Jaguar CD hooked up too.
1372721	1375825	Iron Soldier was one of the games they were playing, so I was like, eh.
1377206	1377507	Whatever.
1378207	1381549	Alright, let's other housekeeping tonight.
1381849	1383650	Don't forget to use our Twitter.
1383690	1384291	Join us on Twitter.
1384311	1386412	We'll be taking Twitter topics a little later in the show.
1386792	1395277	Twitter.com slash OLR and you also can add us on Facebook, Orange Lounge Radio and we have a live journal community too at Orange Lounge.
1395957	1397698	We have an update from Breslul.
1398199	1403662	The USL Madness, the tournament to find the greatest video game of all time is almost over.
1403982	1405122	It's almost a done deal.
1405162	1407644	We have an update from Breslul on what's going on on our forums.
1409500	1410120	Hello, OLR.
1410160	1411001	This is BreathWall.
1411261	1414143	I'm giving you another update on the Madness Tournament in our form.
1414563	1416064	We're actually down to the Final Four.
1416244	1424189	It's Link to the Past versus Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI versus Ocarina of Time, I'm pretty sure.
1424949	1429992	Yes, Chrono Trigger versus Link to the Past and Ocarina of Time versus Final Fantasy VI.
1430052	1431253	Those are the final matchups.
1432253	1436436	We don't have that many votes, but both matchups are incredibly close.
1437116	1459237	so be sure to get your votes in tonight if you're listening live if you're listening via the podcast pay attention to the forums because the final matchup will be coming this week and we will have a new winner of the Madness Tournament for more information once again log on to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on forums talk to you guys later, bye bye
1459813	1464074	Very interesting matchup in the Final Four because they had two Zelda games somehow made it to the Final Four.
1464174	1467475	But Final Fantasy VI is up against Ocarina of Time.
1468035	1470235	Gotta tell you, my vote went to Final Fantasy VI.
1470355	1471855	That's one of my favorite Final Fantasies.
1471875	1474856	Probably, I don't know if I'd say... I would give it the VI too.
1475436	1480917	And don't get me wrong, I realize I've said my piece on Ocarina of Time and it's still a great, great, great game.
1480937	1484398	But Final Fantasy VI is like a great, great, great, great, great game.
1485358	1487739	The other matchup is Link to the Past versus Chrono Trigger.
1488099	1493242	I personally voted for Link to the Past, but I know, of course, Chrono Trigger has this extremely loyal fan base.
1493282	1495262	I really wouldn't be surprised to see that win.
1496803	1502506	Although, you know, Link to the Past, if I had a Super Nintendo sitting in front of me and both of those cards, I'd reach for Link to the Past.
1502606	1502906	I would.
1503806	1506747	I would probably play through more of that in one sitting than I could Chrono Trigger 2.
1506987	1509207	But anyway, it doesn't really matter what I think.
1509347	1510768	It's what you guys think.
1510808	1512288	So go check that out in our forums.
1512348	1513628	We'll have more updates on the winner.
1513648	1516029	And if you don't like the games that are there, we'll poo on you.
1516089	1520390	You should have been voting or sending your top 25 list like we told you to a couple months ago.
1520710	1522231	So if you missed your chance this year, don't worry.
1522251	1523831	You get to do it all again next year.
1524591	1524851	All right.
1527212	1527612	Let's see.
1529373	1532294	SSJ100, Matt in our chat says Ocarina isn't a Link to the Past.
1532435	1532935	That's true.
1533415	1536417	But Link to the Past did have an Ocarina in it if I remember right, didn't it?
1536637	1539939	Wasn't it one of the early ones where you, or at least it had like a whistle type thing.
1539959	1540979	It had like some sort of whistle.
1540999	1541920	That looked like an Ocarina.
1541940	1545022	It was kind of like a really, really old creation of that.
1545162	1545402	Anyhow.
1546022	1546923	Game Developers Conference
1566380	1568082	Majesco is now being threatened by Nasdaq with a delisting.
1568102	1573888	The company now has 180 calendar days to bring its stock price above $1 per share, the minimum required to remain on the exchange.
1588922	1602085	The trick is, though, that it can't just pop up its fiscally hurting head above a buck for a day and everything will be fine.
1602105	1610588	It has to stay above the $1 mark, I guess, for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days prior to August 30, 2010.
1613607	1619195	Now, if you think about it, Majeska hasn't released much for a while.
1619415	1622759	I mean, really their big franchise right now is Cooking Mama.
1623400	1626364	And Cooking Mama's what, like Gardening Mama?
1627085	1629749	I mean, they've kind of dug that into the ground, haven't they?
1630097	1633298	Yeah, I mean, it's... They've got a few games coming out.
1633318	1636618	I know, like, there's Pirates of Plunder are supposed to be coming out soon.
1636658	1637518	But, I mean, come on.
1638659	1643520	Between Pirates of Plunder, Flips Twisted World, you know, a bunch of these secondary titles there for the Wii.
1644720	1649121	And, yes, I just don't... I don't really see this happening.
1649521	1652921	I mean, they don't have any big... They put out the Mad Dog McCree pack on Wii.
1653722	1654262	Oh, whoa!
1655142	1655422	Well...
1656683	1657143	DarkSakura
1681617	1684138	The BloodRayne games, but again, those are kind of old news.
1684398	1685638	They haven't been doing a whole lot these days.
1685678	1692640	No, they've only really been doing DS and Wii titles, and they've been very secondary, I'm sorry to say.
1692940	1702403	Like I said, the last few games that come out from them... Okay, Data East Arcade Classics Collection.
1703559	1710243	Yeah, that's a nice collection of games, but it's not going to sell the copies that they need to make money.
1710423	1715286	I mean, it's just... No AAA title, or even really A titles.
1715486	1716247	A lot of C titles.
1716307	1717508	Let me put it this way.
1717948	1723211	A company like 505 Games, I mean, they're pretty brand new.
1723371	1728675	I mean, they're relatively new, like a few years old, and they put out a lot of crap.
1729295	1736379	But they're putting out more games than these guys are, and they actually have some decent titles coming up that are pretty notable, like Naughty Bear or something like that.
1736479	1739441	Well, they may not also be traded on the stock market either.
1739501	1744564	Keep in mind that we're not talking about if they get delisted from the stock market, they're going to just go under immediately.
1745044	1748386	Although that's sometimes a side effect.
1748466	1750587	Well, Atari's still kicking.
1751728	1753929	I mean, not as much as they used to, but they're kicking.
1754409	1757231	They're kicking with the floaties and their, you know, kickboard.
1757271	1760593	But it's just, it's not what it was.
1760613	1764856	I mean, Midway, they went under and all their assets got bought out.
1765536	1767017	Majesco, I could see that happening.
1767098	1769919	I mean, you know, Gardening Mama, that could be something.
1770120	1771581	Or, like, you know, the Cooking Mama series.
1772041	1775903	That could be something that would probably fit with, like, Ubisoft even or something.
1775923	1777665	SSJ100Matt makes an excellent point in our chat room.
1777945	1779166	Chat.orange.com.
1779186	1784249	They should have brought President Cat over before they go under because President Cat would be a AAA title.
1784910	1785210	Indeed.
1787133	1787533	It would.
1787814	1789816	Hold out hope for E3 at Majesco's booth.
1789837	1790337	You never know.
1790417	1790878	You never know.
1792861	1799610	If President Cat does show up at E3, I will be going over to the booth of the person who had the balls to put it out saying, would you like to shake my hand?
1803390	1805051	That'd be all sorts of crazy.
1806332	1812195	Oh, by the way, like they did with E3 last year, Nintendo's press conference.
1812435	1815277	Oh, by the way, here's a Metroid Other M trailer.
1815337	1822541	It's like, oh, by the way, I think we have a candidate for a perfect title this holiday season.
1823062	1825283	This election season, we have the candidate for you.
1827236	1830239	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1848735	1850056	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1864770	1884213	and then there's been a lot of the little thing that they were doing their conference talking about SOCOM 4 because SOCOM is going to be the big franchise that gets the support of PlayStation Move this year and I noticed they went out of their way to say look how you don't go flailing about
1884773	1888455	Like, you know, they really kind of tried to poke fun at the weed very subtly.
1888775	1890476	They said, notice how he's not flailing about.
1890756	1892217	He made these very subtle motions.
1892257	1896179	And I got to say, granted, I'm not a SOCOM player, so I didn't really know what to look for.
1896599	1898180	But you could see the dude sitting there.
1898200	1907005	And if it was a live demo, which I have no reason to doubt that it was, it looked pretty, yeah, he's just kind of using it as another way to control the game.
1907967	1911071	But that's just like the Call of Duty games that are on the Wii.
1911131	1914495	I mean, it can be done.
1914555	1921383	I mean, you can just use the one controller as a pointer and then the other one to kind of control your movements.
1922124	1928251	And then maybe throw in some different motion-sensitive commands that you can do for different things.
1928351	1932514	Well, I know they were trying to really make it a point, too, to say, look at the precision.
1932574	1934235	This thing has great precision.
1934295	1936376	This is a precise controller.
1936396	1941059	They were really trying to take a jab at the fact that we can sometimes be a little all over the place.
1941399	1942099	And I do agree.
1942139	1943480	It's probably going to be more precise.
1943680	1946142	Because they've had more time to perfect the technology.
1946242	1946762	Exactly.
1947322	1953126	But, I mean, from what their showings were of what they're going to be putting out, come on.
1953946	1955827	You're not that much better than Nintendo.
1955907	1956768	Like, for example...
1957188	1959031	iPad Move Party
1973869	1974210	Come on.
1974950	1975431	Oh, great.
1975471	1976792	More party game collections.
1976852	1977533	Yay.
1977553	1977994	You know what, though?
1978054	1979916	If that's what sells, that's what sells.
1979976	1980376	No, no, no.
1980416	1988145	And I don't have a problem with them doing that because it's kind of neat to see that kind of a party game with actually good graphics in it.
1988205	1988705	You know what I mean?
1989306	1989426	And...
1990487	1996129	It would be neat if they actually figure out unique ways to do this, but dude, they've got an archery game in there.
1996549	2000430	It's just like the fucking archery game in Wii Sports Resort.
2000450	2002531	But in HD.
2002811	2003331	Who cares?
2003371	2006152	Well, to be fair, there's a Lord of the Rings game coming too, for what it's worth.
2006752	2009273	That's a port of a Wii game and looks like it.
2010153	2014676	And then they did make sure to stress that they had so many companies behind it.
2014716	2017818	Like they showed a slide where there was just logos all over.
2017898	2024062	Pretty much all their big publishers are jumping on board with Move somehow, which isn't too big of a surprise, honestly.
2025363	2028364	It'll just be interesting to see if there's that must-have game.
2028805	2031406	There's that must-have game that really sells the move.
2031566	2033046	I don't know if SOCOM 4 is it.
2033406	2041050	I mean, SOCOM 4, don't get me wrong, SOCOM 4, there's a lot of SOCOM fans, and especially because they've made it a point to say you don't have to use move if you don't want to.
2041110	2042690	It's just something that's there, too.
2042950	2046932	Exactly, and I like how they do have the option there, and options are good.
2047292	2051734	I'm surprised Sony's jumping on that bandwagon because that wasn't really something that was their mantra.
2052054	2060881	Socom isn't really that title that has crossed the line to get everybody interested, including the soccer moms, which are important because it's their credit card usually with the kids.
2061961	2062562	It'll be neat.
2063002	2071508	I think the PlayStation Move party stuff will be okay, especially if they're going to bundle that with the software.
2072629	2085551	But my thing is though too, is you gotta buy, you know, at least one of these is gonna come with your kit or whatever that's gonna have the camera, which I don't even really need this because I have the camera already.
2087150	2087691	Thanks for watching!
2102932	2103953	DarkSakura, what are your thoughts on Move?
2103993	2104594	What's with the lightbulb?
2125256	2129242	I think it's to be able to see the different players and where they are in the room type of thing.
2130003	2132427	That and because it's something that the camera can track.
2133228	2134430	Oh yeah, because it's all camera based.
2134450	2139918	That's why they have little glowing balls on people when they're motion capturing them and stuff like that.
2141819	2142159	I don't know.
2142279	2143360	Again, I'm kind of torn.
2143420	2147081	I look at PlayStation Move and I go, oh, okay, neat.
2147301	2148401	I like what Sony's doing with that.
2148421	2154663	But then I look at it and go, eh, but there's nothing that's going to make me run out and buy this day one right now.
2154763	2156643	Again, I'm not really the SOCOM fan.
2156663	2157704	That doesn't really speak to me.
2158424	2158844	I don't know.
2158884	2162745	These minigame collections don't look anything better than the Wii except maybe the graphics.
2162765	2165326	There's nothing that makes me go, OMG, got to get one of these day one.
2165346	2165806	Here's the problem.
2166526	2168947	is that they haven't figured out why they're not selling as well.
2169227	2175349	That's really what it comes down to is they think, oh my god, it's because this other console has motion sensitive stuff.
2175649	2176589	That's why it's selling well.
2176669	2179770	No, it's because it has casual games and games that appeal to families.
2179810	2180811	That's why it's selling well.
2182011	2183251	I just think it's too little too late.
2184172	2185572	You think they're jumping into this too late?
2186292	2187273	Heck yeah.
2187473	2191694	I mean, I think that Microsoft has the better idea, you know.
2192577	2199163	But basically what they're trying to do with this is that they're trying to put themselves on equal footing with the Nintendo Wii.
2199543	2204387	And basically then it's going to be, okay, look, both of these systems have the motion technology.
2204848	2207870	Now let's compare the rest of the features.
2208190	2213235	And when you compare the rest of the features, the Wii just looks like something from the last generation.
2213255	2219160	The minute this thing comes out, there will be that bundle that includes Move that they're really going to be pushing the holiday season.
2219520	2222802	Hey, it's a Blu-ray and a Wii type thing in one.
2223102	2224303	That's what it is.
2224483	2225904	That's Sony's strategy, I'm sure.
2225984	2227284	It does everything.
2227545	2228905	It only does everything.
2230326	2231987	Except on the leap years.
2232087	2235929	To be fair, Sony's made a lot of ground in the past couple years.
2235989	2237650	I think they've got to do this.
2238311	2239912	They're still way behind in the numbers.
2241994	2243395	It's a good idea, but here's the other thing.
2243656	2248421	Even with Natal, Natal's going to be the same problem, I think, even to a greater extent.
2248842	2254108	At least with Natal, and I'll give him credit for this, at least with Natal, I don't have to fucking buy $320 worth of controllers.
2256070	2256771	It's the camera.
2257171	2257571	That's it.
2257912	2258172	Done.
2258452	2261134	I don't have to make any more fucking purchases at all.
2271843	2281191	Well, they're basically stating that they're going to have the full lineup of the Natal titles at E3, which will be cool.
2282092	2292180	Of course, they've got EA, Capcom, Turn 10, Spawn Point behind them, and that they are, quote, putting their best people on the job.
2293201	2298605	So they should actually be seeing some pretty good stuff this June.
2299386	2302387	What big Xbox franchise do you think might Natal be?
2302447	2304307	I mean, I guess we've heard Fable already.
2304707	2316949	But my thought, and I remember making this prediction earlier in the year, and I don't remember if it was on the show or on one of the forums or what have you, but I remember saying, I think Gears of War 3 is going to be unveiled at E3, and it's going to have Natal support.
2317249	2325971	And it's kind of funny that SOCOM showed up with the PlayStation move, because when I saw that, I was like, wow, that's kind of close-ish.
2326071	2327751	That's like PlayStation's kind of...
2328371	2353408	Shootery type game As long as they take a mature approach with it Like, you know, where it makes sense for the game Not just, it seems tacked on And you're not flailing about like an idiot But they, I mean, Sony made a big point to say You will not flail around like an idiot So if they do it right Again, I'm talking out my ass It just seems like it's odd to me We have heard nothing about Gears of War 3 I have this strange feeling
2354208	2377667	you know it's going to happen those games are huge sellers I have this strange feeling that's the elephant behind the curtain that's going to show at E3 when DarkSakura talks about they're bringing all their Natal titles my gut tells me that's one of them I'm also though looking in terms of course there's going to be sports games that are going to use it although I would like to see how it would work with like a racing game if it would be something like you foresee you know what I mean
2378666	2379506	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2399995	2418511	granted the technology has come a long way in the past few years I just really hope we see that and I hope at E3 they show Natal in a realistic environment and not against a really well lit white wall although you know that's what they're going to do so that it's super uber responsive because part of me is like how's this really going to work in my living room
2419051	2420751	I want them to do it in front of a big red wall.
2421531	2422172	Or a blue wall.
2422372	2425252	Or a tacky curtain out of the 1970s like you'd see in my house.
2425352	2430613	Or like, remember the Wii demo stations I had up at E3 that year with the couch?
2431733	2433134	They just made little living rooms.
2433234	2434274	Why don't they do something like that?
2434654	2435654	I'm hoping that's what we see.
2435814	2436914	Again, I don't know.
2437354	2438215	E3 is a couple months away.
2438315	2440155	I don't even know if I'm going at this point, to be honest.
2440175	2441835	I want to go, but I don't know.
2441935	2443796	I want to, but I have other priorities this year.
2444096	2444916	Yeah, not this year.
2447193	2453300	I just... Really, the only thing that I think right now is an advantage for them is that I don't have to buy extra accessories.
2453980	2462349	Because, really, that's going to be just like... And that's going to be a big... I hope they push that as, okay, hey, look, you got to buy $320 worth of crap.
2463250	2466053	Granted, I'm throwing these numbers out my ass, but, I mean, look at the Wii.
2466854	2468376	Lesser technology, same price.
2470922	2479389	You know, I gotta buy all this kind of extra stuff to get it to work versus it's camera, it's done, you just plug it in and go.
2480730	2483952	You are the controller, you know, that's it.
2484373	2486374	But then again, since I am the controller...
2487535	2488275	Thanks for watching!
2510560	2515942	But if they think of some really cool ways to like, you know, play first person shooters somehow, more power to them.
2516883	2517543	All right, we'll see.
2517723	2519044	E3's a little ways off.
2519144	2523085	But again, I think Microsoft's going to have that same approach as Sony come the holiday season.
2523145	2526367	Now it's the Xbox 360 with Natal or whatever they call it.
2526787	2528328	I mean... It's not going to be Natal.
2528908	2529929	It's not going to be that either.
2529989	2532010	It's kind of weird they still have not announced the name.
2532030	2533751	But I guess they could still do it at E3.
2533771	2535932	So they didn't announce the name until they announced the name.
2536292	2539934	It's funny... I get it, but E3 is rubbing up a little closer.
2539954	2541235	You know why they named it Move, right?
2541355	2542836	Because they couldn't get the trademark for Ark.
2543136	2543576	Oh, really?
2543757	2543977	Yeah.
2544857	2545718	Who had a trademark?
2546579	2552023	There's some issue with them not being able to get the trademark, so they had to go with Move instead.
2552063	2554004	I think PlayStation Move's a better name.
2554925	2559688	Because their logo's still the Ark, but it's an A-looking thing.
2560689	2563151	I kind of think it's the better name for the mass market.
2563691	2564952	But then again, what do I know?
2565072	2565613	The Wii.
2566513	2569095	What a dumb name that was, and yet it worked.
2569115	2570917	I told you why it worked.
2571677	2573719	Simple, easy to remember, easy to market.
2574459	2580840	They made it into an adjective for games, like to Xerox something or to get a Kleenex.
2581321	2585481	They made the Wii just like how people used to say... I'm going to go Wii.
2585521	2586822	No, Wii is not a generic yet.
2587262	2590863	No, I know it's not a generic, but it's got that household recognition.
2591703	2595564	It'd be like Bounty for paper towels.
2596464	2596704	All right.
2598044	2601945	Let's move on with some more gaming news that maybe don't involve motion.
2602603	2604185	Well, it might, but we never know.
2604686	2605587	That's true, that's true.
2606748	2607849	That was something they were talking about.
2608450	2613776	But apparently, though, it has been announced that Rockman 3 will be making its way out this holiday season.
2615879	2616719	Not a big surprise.
2616920	2618742	I mean, they took kind of a year off.
2619264	2620105	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2639786	2644892	Green Day Rock Band which has now been announced to be releasing on June 8th worldwide.
2646133	2650277	Also on the three major platforms Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii.
2650838	2654582	And of course we'll use up to six players, three mics, three instruments.
2655403	2657044	And they will also have...
2658325	2664808	and apparently the ability to import the tracks as well or export the tracks in the Rock Band 2 as well.
2664828	2671110	There's going to be all 47 tracks that are in the game will be exportable for I guess $10.
2671950	2677652	So it's basically Beatles Rock Band but now with Green Day and you can export the tracks.
2677712	2682954	I don't even see it as this release to me is not even as big as Beatles Rock Band.
2683054	2685775	I think this is more like Guitar Hero Metallica.
2687202	2716890	but at least you can export the tracks can't do that shit with Metallica or Beatles to be fair or Van Halen yeah or Beatles but Beatles that was a different situation Beatles kinda Beatles are in a little category of their own too you know Beatles is there's not a lot of bands that can get away with just being in their own bubble the music game genre but Beatles can Green Day don't think they're there yet but this this is this will be nice for them they have I mean they have a lot of easily recognizable songs that you know I think the export feature will be very popular too
2717611	2728301	Yeah, and also they said that there's going to be a special edition Green Day Rock Band Plus that will come, I guess, to Xbox 360 and PS3 for $69.99.
2728521	2740051	It includes fancier packaging and an export feature, I guess a voucher to export the discs to the hard drive, and six previously released Green Day DLC tracks.
2741452	2750062	Actdeft in our chatroom, chat.orange.radio.com says, also, George Harrison's son already said that there would be a Rock Band 3 and it will help you learn to play real instruments.
2750682	2754727	Wouldn't that be interesting if that's kind of the tie-in is more making it real?
2755427	2755808	I don't know.
2757089	2759171	Part of me says maybe there should be a new instrument.
2760052	2788291	but then I think it came up a couple months ago on the show I think the idea had come up that maybe what Rock Band 3 is going to introduce is something like the SingStar space where you upload your own stuff to like a YouTube-y type of site my gut tells me that's going to be Rock Band 3's thing especially with the network taking off as it is and so forth I think Rock Band 3 is going to be really about now you can watch your friends rock out from across the country all I gotta say man is by the time that comes out I mean
2789071	2808677	it's ridiculous the amount of tracks you can have you can have like about over a thousand tracks right now that are in that game I mean that's the way you do a music game right there you have the download content I mean literally there's a whole library of stuff to pick from and you can just keep taking it with you through each and you know reiteration of the game
2810313	2810633	All right.
2811034	2813715	Well, moving on to other news, kind of a follow-up to last week.
2813735	2817558	You know, obviously last week we had a very fun show here at OLR while the Oscars were going on.
2817878	2824663	But something else that was going on at the time was that Ubisoft games were unplayable because their whole service was down.
2825464	2833669	And apparently, and I think I had suggested this when somebody said it on the show, it was indeed a DOS attack, it sounds like.
2833790	2834650	Hackers went in.
2834710	2835651	Servers were attacked.
2835831	2836711	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
2866201	2872724	But again, just kind of goes to show how their DRM system is ridiculous and was already cracked as we talked about last week, correct?
2873004	2873264	Yes.
2873284	2876985	Because there's the code in there that's very similar to Steam.
2877186	2884769	If Steam ever goes bankrupt, which I don't think they're going to anytime soon, but if Steam were to ever go under, all those games would have to be activated without Steam's presence.
2885229	2887110	And Ubisoft's games have something similar.
2887510	2891111	Someone found it and went, bink, and unlocked that for everybody.
2891311	2892312	Hey, what's this button do?
2892332	2892532	Exactly.
2893432	2894733	Ah, there it is.
2895353	2899718	Togak in our chatroom says, haha, I hope they get DDoSed more so they learn their lesson.
2900779	2908247	I don't know if I'm really an advocate of DDoSing, but I think this certainly shows the weakness of why this should have never been done in the first place.
2908687	2908887	Yep.
2911385	2915288	Well, how about something that's a little bit less irritating?
2916469	2917070	What do you think, Rob?
2917510	2917731	Sure.
2918451	2918912	Akira Yamaoka.
2918932	2920893	He's less irritating.
2920933	2921694	Good to hear about him.
2921754	2922715	He is less irritating.
2922735	2923956	What's he up to lately?
2924556	2934405	It's nice to hear him on a video game podcast because, you know, when he left Konami, there was a little worry that, oh, he's leaving to go start a band or do something not to do with games whatsoever.
2934425	2934505	Yeah.
2934790	2941836	We did a panel at Game Developers Conference talking about as long as audio is fun, the game will be too.
2942697	2943857	That's what it was called.
2944938	2949242	But he was talking about how the audio, how the music goes into...
2951103	2954185	And he's quoted as saying, when there's no sound, the brain fills in the gap.
2981884	2992053	and then actually went to play some music with gaps of silence and then went back in and added sharp sounds to it, of course, which freaked people out.
2992973	2995035	But I think it's very effective.
2996196	2998638	And then he played some guitar for everybody to chill them out.
3000059	3026305	I can see that because that's kind of Silent Hill's thing is that sometimes it'll be very quiet when you're walking around all you hear those footsteps that I'm sure are off sync like he talks about there you walk around with the footsteps and all of a sudden you start hearing the radio noise the very uncomfortable kind of noise and that's how you know something's up interesting to kind of hear the science behind that it's simple psychology I mean they even you know I remember back in the day when I took music theory
3027887	3028548	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3049588	3051609	Wow, there's a whole science behind it.
3051649	3054370	No word though about sadly what he's working on now or what have you?
3054970	3055731	No.
3055751	3060233	Wasn't there some rumor or something that came up a while back that he was in cahoots with EA doing something?
3060853	3063074	I want to say that had come up on the show like a while ago.
3063114	3064395	Maybe one of the chatters wants to fill in.
3065495	3069657	I seriously think though we haven't heard the last of him in games, that's for sure.
3069677	3073319	There's samples on the article though of what he's playing.
3073439	3073659	Yeah.
3074755	3075175	Very cool.
3076375	3083457	Alright, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates and what's coming out to a video game store near you that maybe won't make you so uncomfortable.
3085038	3089239	Well, these games make me uncomfortable because I can't believe that they're still being made.
3090039	3093420	Although technically this is not really a new game, it's just kind of remade.
3094120	3120174	Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver are out today on the Nintendo DS later this week we're getting Spectral Force Genesis on DS as well one of the big games this week of course God of War 3 making its way out on Playstation 3 the expansion for Dragon Age Origins Awakening will be coming out on PC and Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 this week as well
3121575	3125577	Fragile Dreams, Feral Ruins of the Moon on the Wii.
3125817	3127298	This was a pretty decent game.
3128159	3133502	Build a Bear, Welcome Hugsville on DS coming from Activision.
3134442	3136843	Who bought that game from Game Factory?
3136943	3138404	Why would you purchase that title?
3138424	3139705	I don't know.
3140785	3144027	Metro 2033 coming out on PC and Xbox 360 this week.
3144867	3149170	Sam X2, Beyond Time and Space coming out as a collection on...
3150569	3151911	PC, and the Wii this week.
3151971	3153634	That's the entire collection of Season 2.
3154956	3157439	Infinite Space on Nintendo DS this week.
3159042	3162967	A game based off, I guess, a Disney channel series.
3163128	3165852	Sunny with a Chance on a Nintendo DS.
3167643	3170704	Another Build-A-Bear game, Friendship Valley coming to the Wii.
3171484	3172184	Yippee skippee.
3173444	3176305	For PC though, this is a pretty big RTS game.
3176365	3183066	Command & Conquer 4, Tiberium Twilight coming out on PC this week.
3183907	3189608	Resonance of Fate, the other RPG you should be playing, coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3191328	3192189	Kind of a cool game actually.
3192209	3199614	That one's a little bit like Final Fantasy, but instead of using magic and stuff, you actually use Uzis and rocket launchers, which is all sorts of cool.
3200435	3207099	Hidden Mysteries, Buckingham Palace, Secrets of Kings and Queens on the DS, another casual title there.
3208560	3215105	Pizza Delivery Boy, kind of a little bit of a cross between Cooking Mama and Crazy Taxi on the Wii.
3217101	3222186	Hall of Fame Ultimate Hoops Challenge budget basketball game on the Wii.
3223987	3232574	And not really a game, but the new elites are supposed to be coming out this week bundled with Halo 3 ODST and Forza 3.
3232714	3234315	And that's it.
3235657	3240400	All right, traveling over to Japan to look at the releases that are coming out over there on the Xbox 360.
3240520	3241982	Darksiders comes out.
3242682	3243022	Kind of...
3243683	3249886	It's an action-y-ish game from Konami that I've seen described as God of War meets Zelda.
3250626	3251727	I'm sure that's interesting.
3252167	3258310	Also on the Xbox 360, Momo 2 Jai Daisen Ryaku Ultra Deluxe comes out.
3258850	3264933	Kind of a strategy type of game with these chibi little bombers and, of course, anime girls as the captains.
3265454	3266334	But it looks kind of cute.
3266914	3269976	Don't think that'll be a game that comes out here, though, so you'll have to import that one.
3270837	3273321	That's pretty much it on the Xbox 360.
3273842	3276065	PlayStation 3 has some exciting titles this week though.
3276386	3279931	PlayStation 3 is having something in Japan coming out this week called Torn.
3280292	3282215	And it's also coming out with a bundle.
3282555	3285440	And it's not a game actually, it's a DVR type system.
3285580	3286621	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3305423	3306724	That is coming out in Japan this week.
3306784	3307264	Very cool.
3307684	3315589	Also, Ryu Ga Gotoku 4 Densetsu Wo Sugumono 4 comes out this week in Japan.
3316629	3324173	I believe that is Yakuza 4, which is kind of funny because we just got Yakuza 3 this week in the U.S.
3324594	3328696	And, of course, some of the articles that we've had recently on OrangeLawnTrader.com written by our
3329116	3348952	Lovely Webmaster Deekman They cut some crap out of Yakuza 3 Which is not making people happy I think on his Twitter he was saying Some like 20 different side quests and stuff Were all cut So hopefully if they do decide to port Yakuza 4 Which just came out on the PS3 in Japan this week They will not cut so darn much
3349712	3353255	Also on the PS3 this week in Japan, the God of War Collection makes its way to Japan.
3354376	3355576	That's pretty much it on the PS3.
3355897	3357738	Going to the Nintendo Wii, there really isn't much.
3357758	3359559	There's just one little title from Squeenix.
3360080	3363182	Oyaku de Asobo Miphi no Omochabako.
3363302	3365283	I wouldn't get too excited because I said that was Squeenix.
3365684	3370007	It honestly looks like a Sesame Street type of game featuring little rabbit characters.
3370427	3372870	That honestly, their mouths look like buttholes.
3373090	3375333	Like, I don't have a better way to explain it.
3375693	3379597	But if you look at their little mouths, they look like balloon knots.
3379817	3382420	And I wouldn't get too excited about that.
3382540	3383561	But, hey, there you go.
3387500	3387780	Sengoku Basara 2
3403913	3427813	a crayon game yay crayons and lastly going to the PSP Gundam Assault Survive comes out and ooh this is a fun one of it Jamie you'll be excited for this Ys 1 and 2 the 7 set comes out in Japan nice they've ported those games a couple times over in Japan haven't they I like Ys I don't think I've seen them out over here well I've got you're out of the DS are they out of the DS?
3427933	3430455	Ys 1 too oh okay very cool
3431607	3437470	Alright, Kevo in our chat wants to know why the hell did they cut so much of it, I believe, speaking about Yakuza 3.
3438250	3444714	I believe, long story short, there were some things that they felt were, well, A, you could just say they were being lazy, but they rationalized it.
3444754	3454238	I think some of it was like Mahjong minigames, which, you know, it's not really a huge game here in the US, so I guess they figured people wouldn't know how to play it.
3454899	3455279	And I think...
3456260	3457180	Thanks for watching!
3479263	3494078	I see a lot of friends of mine really into this game though so I don't think it's really affecting you know I think if you're a fan of Yakuza you're gonna grumble and cry but you still end up playing it so all right let's move on to the UK DarkSakura
3495000	3498381	On the 16th, we have Dragon Age Origins Awakening.
3499322	3500302	The 17th, Perfect Dark.
3501482	3505063	And on the 18th, The Calling on Wii.
3505083	3506744	19th, BlazBlue Calamity Trigger.
3507864	3510725	Command & Conquer 4, Tiberian Twilight, God of War 3.
3510765	3513466	Metro 2033, MotoGP 910.
3513526	3514827	And Supreme Commander 2.
3523049	3523329	That it?
3523629	3523830	Yeah.
3524450	3524750	Alright.
3526312	3527553	Okay, let's see.
3528814	3545767	So, one of the big things that they were talking about during GDC and actually something that Mike kind of talked about during E3 last year was OnLive, the streaming service that's going to be available for, I guess, PCs and Macs
3546307	3547048	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3564262	3571028	Um, and they announced that they're going to be launching their service June 17th, um, and it will be $15 per month.
3571808	3589082	And what's going to, um, you know, offer, this is, uh, depending on, I guess, um, you know, they're going to have like a micro console that's going to be released later on, I guess like a set-top box, if you will, um, that you can actually use instead of your PC.
3589903	3590003	Um...
3591164	3619411	and I guess also you'll be able to they're going to have some upgrades later on they're going to offer 1080p support at 60 frames per second as I guess more bandwidth becomes available and OnLive I guess is going to be going the first three months they're going to only allow 25,000 people in I guess they're going to be staggering when people can join up
3620191	3621251	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3639480	3653722	Some of the games that are going to be available on the service, they are mentioning Mass Effect 2, Dragon Age Origins, also later on Prince of Persia, The Forgotten Sands will be available.
3655912	3679174	and apparently I guess 250,000 people signed up for the online beta not that all of them were let in and it says they expect that the demand will far outweigh the capacity of the services servers and so that they're going to actually have people pre-subscribe well of course they want to fluff it up sold out hard to get into exclusive you know because they want to pump people up
3680536	3689482	I'm not knocking this because certainly I think this story has kind of come up before and it's kind of been just poo-pooed off as, oh yeah, sure, that'll happen.
3689902	3695066	But now they're saying, no, really, we're going to have this out in the fall and we plan to do this console and everything.
3695446	3702051	But explain to me real quick, and I realize there's a science behind this, but I need it really broken down for me here because I don't understand hardware so much.
3702111	3703412	How is this not GameTap?
3704913	3706294	This is basically...
3708766	3709086	I don't know.
3709626	3711787	I think it's going to be more sophisticated games, basically.
3711887	3717008	It's not just emulating old games or older PC titles.
3717448	3723229	Say, for example, you have a crappy computer that happens to be on a decent network.
3723289	3730571	You can run Crysis now on it, basically with very little lag or no lag at all.
3730971	3733052	Burnout, you're going to be able to run that kind of stuff.
3734392	3735033	GameTap GameTap
3755367	3762590	And this also, they're going to also have a kind of an on-live game portal that's going to be free as well on top of all this stuff.
3762990	3767591	It's basically like a browser-based streaming device.
3768151	3781016	They're also going to have free streaming of selection of demos as well as, I guess, a limited number of full games for rent for a per-game fee without the monthly service charge.
3781416	3783997	So kind of think of like what GameTap did except not free.
3785137	3787158	You know, like their little free offerings.
3790781	3792562	I don't know, it's interesting.
3792582	3798005	I just don't know if I would really, I would probably not use this.
3799125	3800346	I just don't play enough PC games.
3802905	3806688	Toy Gak says if it runs on their computers I might be able to play modern games again.
3806708	3811351	I'm assuming that's the whole catch to this.
3811731	3819877	It's kind of like having your PC as being a console whereas you don't have to worry about your PC being up to spec to run these games well.
3820577	3824800	You just have to have a fast enough internet connection and their PCs will do the work for you.
3825980	3826421	Interesting.
3826501	3831083	I'm really curious to see how this runs, especially if it's really that smooth.
3831123	3838947	Because I would think that this would run into a similar problem as the whole Ubisoft thing, is that if your internet stops working, the games stop working.
3838967	3841048	Because how else are you going to get the data from the computer?
3841108	3845070	Well, yeah, that just goes with anything as far as streaming content goes.
3845690	3847531	You're on demand or anything.
3847571	3851894	If your connection stops working, then obviously, yes, it will shut off.
3852654	3854355	But that's the same with a phone call.
3854395	3858197	If your phone service goes out, then your phone call goes down.
3858978	3862099	But I guess it would matter.
3863740	3871785	You have to make sure that your data center, wherever you're connecting on live, if their data center goes down or wherever nearby, then yeah, you'd be kind of screwed.
3871805	3871965	Right.
3872366	3874348	Chat, let me pose this question to chat real quick.
3874408	3876571	Is on live something that interests you?
3877112	3877793	Why or why not?
3878073	3880857	And I'll kind of ask the folks in the studio here the same question.
3880897	3882219	Is on live something that interests you?
3882299	3882880	Why or why not?
3883821	3884102	Loki?
3884703	3884783	No.
3885606	3896175	and the reason why is because I don't play a lot of PC games anyways and a lot of the games that it seems like they're going to have on here are also console crossovers which I would just play on a console on my own time if I was doing that.
3896355	3897155	I don't see why.
3897956	3902119	Honestly, I don't have a lot of time for games anyways nowadays and I only seem to be playing like one game at a time.
3902800	3904361	I can't see myself paying $15 a month for this.
3906643	3909445	I'm going to say no for the same reasons that Loki said.
3909506	3911928	Well, I'm interested.
3912168	3918473	I'm curious to see how it works in action, but I think Loki hit the nail on the head console crossovers.
3918513	3920875	Most of this is already the stuff that's on the consoles.
3921175	3926740	And I built my PC to run Crysis, so goddammit, if I'm going to play Crysis, it's going to be running on my PC.
3928161	3934106	DarkSakura, I don't know if this is something that would interest you on live, being able to have your low-end computer stream the games.
3935680	3938402	I don't really care about that, honestly.
3939223	3945768	You know, if I'm going to play my live games, I'm just going to sit down and play them on my Xbox.
3946469	3947570	Kick Dan off of Borderlands.
3949391	3949732	Alright.
3951033	3952074	Is something wrong with chat?
3952134	3953295	It got really quiet in there.
3953335	3954396	I'm a little worried.
3954576	3958379	It's all the hallucinogens I piped through the internet.
3958479	3959700	Keep in mind, there's also a delay.
3959780	3965602	So when I say something, it takes like a minute just because we encode to all games who encodes to shout, you know, and da-da-da-da-da.
3965942	3968824	So there's a little bit of a delay between when we say things and when they hit the chat room.
3968844	3971105	But finally, we're getting some feedback here.
3971445	3979549	Actdeft in our chat room says, no, because in Mexico, if the service will even be available here, we don't have a really good connection speed.
3979589	3981109	It's going to be laggy as hell probably.
3982850	3986492	Bochicabua says, interested, but really I don't find it worth it.
3988590	3989571	GameFly account GameFly account
4006670	4006990	DarkSakura.com
4025059	4030901	I mean, that's great to think that you might do that, but in all reality, you're probably not going to.
4031801	4035222	It's going to be hard to keep track of what's going on in each different game.
4035262	4040483	And I know, back in the day, even then I still didn't really play a ton of different games.
4040703	4045065	I'm usually playing one game to completion or until I get tired of it and move on to something else.
4045545	4046305	See, I'm the opposite.
4046365	4047685	I'm gamer ADD all the way.
4048205	4049186	I play one thing and then what?
4049306	4049826	Another thing and what?
4049966	4050106	What?
4050206	4050346	What?
4050366	4050446	What?
4051126	4057031	The fact that I'm playing Final Fantasy XIII two weeks in a row pretty solidly, it's an event.
4057292	4062616	If you listen to the past months of this show, go find another game that I have that much attention for.
4062636	4067360	But you wouldn't feel lost if you didn't have these other options.
4068961	4072725	I just don't see 40 or 50 games on there.
4072765	4077969	I guess that would be a good value, but I wouldn't see myself using it.
4079097	4095642	a couple other quick thoughts here from our chat room Alpha Cananogram seems to think that it's Pokemon that's distracting all our chatters tonight everybody's busy catching their mudkips and their little balls that they run around with now because basically they took the walking trainer and incorporated that into a Pokemon game, am I correct?
4096362	4096882	okay, thank you
4097142	4101768	I used to have the old... It's like bringing back Tamagotchi.
4102269	4103951	I swear to God, that thing looks like a Tamagotchi.
4103991	4109218	You remember the old Pokemon Pikachu things that you just attached to your belt, the pedometer thing?
4109238	4109759	That's what it is.
4109959	4110259	Why not?
4110279	4111341	But remember the old ones.
4114207	4130198	All you need to do is download one of those free Xbox 360 massagers, plug in the fucking controller into the system, duct tape that little walker thing on there, set it to vibrate at the highest setting.
4130218	4130899	You'll be good to go.
4130919	4131519	Or a paint shaker.
4134762	4137445	A couple other quick thoughts from our chat room on live.
4138146	4142251	Akuma JP says, yes, if it is cheaper, I would like to play games for my netbook.
4143112	4144254	Ah, netbook is a good thought.
4144294	4147958	If it's tuned for netbooks, netbooks could be gaming devices.
4147998	4148539	Very interesting.
4149160	4151703	Aki Ripper says, maybe, most likely, no.
4152724	4153085	There you go.
4153365	4163532	Thoughts from our chatroom, chat.orangeandre.com Speaking of moving and pedometers and all that shit, EA Sports Active 2.0 is announced and it's coming out for the Wii, the PS3, and the iPhone.
4164112	4165834	Oddly enough, nothing's said yet on the 360.
4166234	4173239	I can't believe, though, with Project Natal on the horizon, they aren't cooking something up for the 360, but my assumption is it's probably different.
4173779	4174660	Probably much different.
4175200	4182067	Anyhow, EA Sports Active, they are getting a proper sequel, not like a spin-off type thing like you've seen happen with the first set.
4182107	4184890	I think they had more exercises or whatever, but a proper sequel.
4186051	4192258	The console version of the game, now they're going to come with two motion sensors and a heart rate monitor you strap on your arm and leg.
4194306	4194766	Interesting.
4195287	4196688	So it's going to measure your heart rate now.
4198829	4202491	By the way, you can share this information over social networks online.
4202511	4205353	So I'm assuming you're going to be able to Facebook your EA Active Progress.
4205413	4205913	Goody, goody.
4206974	4208435	EA Vancouver is developing it.
4208595	4217981	One other thing I noticed, it looks like almost like a little USB thing that you could like plug into your iPhone or something, almost like a little dongle, if you will, for your iPhone or, of course, iPod Touch with that.
4218101	4219722	So very interesting.
4220362	4221443	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4243358	4244960	for any peripheral.
4245320	4250146	Really, they've done it with the Rock Band guitars and the Guitar Hero guitars, but that's about it.
4252328	4255431	The wireless technology, mostly everything has to be wired.
4257613	4263960	So, I mean, obviously, since these devices are wireless, you're not going to be able to create some sort of wired device to plug in with...
4266389	4279385	That little USB shit could go in Yeah, but they don't do that kind of stuff That's why, it's different They have certain specifications at the meet Also play nice with each other
4280978	4286000	I still think you're... I can't believe that... EA is a big backer of 360.
4286040	4288461	They put a lot of games out.
4288581	4289362	It's going to be Natal.
4289962	4290902	That's why.
4291723	4292263	Alright, anyhow.
4293503	4294684	I could be wrong, but I'm probably not.
4295264	4297325	Let's get into our classic game of the week.
4297345	4299546	Because we're getting to the end of Part A, believe it or not.
4300066	4309610	And we always like to end the first half of our show by taking a trip down memory lane where DarkSakura is going to visit one of our classic video games from yesteryear.
4310282	4312123	It's the classic of the week, DarkSakura.
4312764	4315325	What video game should all the boys and girls out there be enjoying this week?
4316226	4318347	The game of the week is Gradius 2.
4321569	4331115	Gradius 2, and keep in mind, I have to make a mention, it is not the Gradius 2 that we got out as Nemesis 2 for the NES.
4331576	4335718	This is Gradius 2 for the arcade and PC engine.
4336139	4336919	Listen to the music for a minute.
4347783	4351584	Yes, if you play Konami series of music games, you've heard this remix before.
4353245	4354786	That is where Burning Heat came from.
4354806	4365369	That's why when you're actually playing the music, it shows the suns with the little snakes coming out of the fire.
4367150	4370451	Gradius II, it was called Gradius II, The Ambition of Gopher.
4370591	4371031	It was...
4372972	4381037	It came out in 1988 in Japan, and it was the direct sequel to Gradius, and the prequel to Gradius 3, of course.
4382338	4386741	There were versions that came out for the Famicom, the PC Engine, and the X68000.
4387121	4395766	And it has been re-released, the PC Engine version, and Famicom versions are out on the Virtual Console.
4397527	4402289	Well, not in North America until it came out in Gradius Collection that came out in 2006.
4404029	4408170	And then the international releases on the Virtual Console.
4410191	4414192	Gradius 2 came out in Europe in the arcades under the name of Vulcan Venture.
4415268	4416449	Thanks for watching!
4434603	4441571	People think Life Force is Gradius 2 because of the way these games were marketed to us as children is that a lot of us thought Life Force was a sequel to Gradius.
4441851	4444174	But there actually were two separate series in Japan.
4444194	4446156	There was Salamander and there was Gradius.
4446276	4448078	We never got the actual Gradius 2.
4448359	4450041	Well, not back in the NES days.
4450121	4450761	We got it later.
4451462	4451783	Nemesis 2?
4451823	4452063	Mm-hmm.
4454445	4461367	was like the Life Force Grotius, not Grotius, Life Force Salamander thing.
4461407	4471370	That's just a very common whoopsie because, you know, and again, when I was a kid, I thought Life Force was the sequel to Grotius because they looked the same, they felt the same, but two different Japanese series that are just very similar.
4472389	4477793	Well, um, one of the good things, um, that came with this one is also the first one that had the boss rush.
4479354	4485258	Um, uh, that had levels that were only boss confrontation, so it was pretty cool.
4485978	4496385	Um, so yeah, you had, you could pick your different, um, weapon systems so that as you picked up, uh, power-ups, you can choose which of your, uh, um, different, uh, power-ups you could do.
4496405	4502149	Like, you could speed up, you had options, you had missile, double, laser, um, the ripple sucks, by the way.
4503489	4504030	It always has.
4506711	4513993	Now when this came out on the Famicom, it was one of the games that had a mapper chip to increase the graphics and sound.
4514073	4515854	A lot of games in Japan had that.
4516394	4520696	But Nintendo, being big sticklers here in the US, they actually had to have...
4522837	4530603	A lot of games were a lot better overseas because they couldn't bring them out with anything other than the proprietary carts over here, remember?
4534085	4544133	So there was the PC Engine version in 1992 that came out as a Super CD-ROM, which I have a burn of.
4545833	4548874	By the way, one could argue that that's why this game never came out in the U.S.
4548934	4556436	is because of the specialized cart and why Konami instead took the approach to kind of market Life Force as a sequel to Gradius, basically.
4556536	4564738	This is one of the games that I'm looking for, a legit one, by the way, because it is just so awesome.
4564878	4567999	This is my favorite Gradius game.
4568980	4569840	There's also...
4572674	4577937	They added an additional stage though for the PC Engine version that came from the NES version of Life Force.
4578618	4580479	That was also the first stage of Gradius III.
4581279	4586542	It also came out for the Gradius Deluxe Pack for PlayStation, Saturn, and Windows in 96.
4587903	4594187	And then came out worldwide Gradius Collection for the PSP.
4594827	4598849	Of course the PC Engine version was a Hanabi Festival game in 2008.
4604356	4606738	and of course there's all these sweet spots in every boss battle.
4607699	4610001	That's right, that one spot you gotta hit to kill it fast.
4610741	4612503	And Ripple does suck, I agree.
4612703	4613944	Ripple is ass.
4615145	4615545	Ripple!
4615865	4616386	Ha!
4616826	4620209	There it is, your classic game of the week, Gradius 2.
4620429	4622331	That little clip coming to you from the PC Engine.
4622431	4628836	The one reason to ever take the Ripple laser is because the progression afterwards had... Didn't it have doubles?
4630014	4631155	Yeah, Double was in.
4631476	4635821	I mean, the one that came after Ripple, I think it was your other option.
4637223	4641669	I know there was always a reason to take the Ripple route, but you'd just always bypass Ripple.
4642635	4643916	TigerClaw asks a good question.
4643936	4644996	This is a valid question from Jack.
4645136	4646897	Does Gradius 2 have vertical stages?
4647618	4647758	No.
4647838	4647978	No.
4648058	4649639	That was unique to the Salamander series, right?
4649659	4650319	That was Salamander.
4650379	4652040	That was part of what made that series unique, right?
4652060	4652180	Yeah.
4652200	4653180	It was vertical stages.
4653221	4653861	Good question, though.
4655041	4661285	Again, all the marketing changes and stuff from Japan over here kind of screwed us up as a kid.
4661325	4665307	You know, when Final Fantasy 7 came out, who didn't ask, where the hell is 4 through 6?
4667130	4668736	I just thought it was kind of cool.
4668757	4670262	They're like, yeah, we know.
4670564	4672993	I think by then a lot of people had figured it out, but, you know.
4673450	4673710	All right.
4674070	4676351	Anyhow, we're going to take a break here at Orange Lounge Radio.
4676371	4677552	We got plenty more coming up.
4677612	4681033	Some quick news when we come back about DJ Hero and Tron.
4681874	4683775	Anybody see that trailer for the new Tron movie?
4684255	4685015	Looks sweet.
4685315	4687316	But I got to say, well, actually, no, I take it back.
4687356	4689057	The movie's probably going to be ridiculous.
4689277	4695280	But the score by Daft Punk sounds amazing, just even based on that little trailer I saw.
4695860	4697521	Got to say, very cool.
4698081	4700685	Alright, let's see.
4701105	4706874	Also news on XNA and Nintendo, another Hanabi festival coming up.
4706894	4710999	We're going to get into all of that a little later on in Part B of our show.
4711019	4711580	So don't go anywhere.
4711600	4713904	We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4720200	4724665	And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday night, March 14th of 2010.
4725385	4726626	That's right, Pi Day.
4727167	4728468	Hope you're enjoying some pie.
4728568	4730971	We're not really having pie in studio, which is a bit surprising.
4731291	4732092	I'm kind of full, though.
4732132	4735335	I had fast food on the way over to the show, driving back from San Francisco.
4735735	4738538	Sadly, I was in San Francisco, but not at Game Developers Conference.
4738558	4740160	But you know, I'm not a game developer.
4740720	4742262	And, you know, you have to be one of the...
4742942	4746603	Big media companies, it's a magazine or whatever to get in there, but that's okay.
4746963	4749504	Although I think I would find the topics fascinating.
4750044	4753204	Like, you know, I kind of like the science of game development and stuff.
4753244	4756005	You know, I understand that it's not really a media event.
4756025	4758165	That's what E3's for, so I'm not going to be all butthurt.
4758185	4758666	I'm not going.
4758986	4762386	Although I wish I could have crashed some of the sweet parties I've heard about.
4762466	4764407	It would have been fun to try the move stuff out, but...
4765367	4765947	That's about it.
4766027	4767848	It's all going to be at E3 in a couple months anyway.
4768048	4770348	So I'm not too worried about it.
4770609	4772529	Of course, I don't even know if I'm going to E3 this year.
4772549	4774129	I am definitely not going to E3.
4774870	4775270	Sorry to hear it.
4775410	4780771	It's just a strain to try to go each year anyways.
4780831	4784432	I got to take a year off.
4784512	4786133	Last year, remember we went and it was kind of like...
4786773	4788014	Yeah, this is cool.
4788715	4796200	I feel like there's really more I want to see this year between the Portal 2, the Final Fantasy XIV, the Move, the Natal, all this stuff.
4796441	4798382	Or whatever Xbox ends up naming their thing.
4800344	4801925	All that stuff I want to see this year.
4802005	4802966	So it seems like there's more to it.
4803246	4803866	In good time.
4803947	4804427	I don't know.
4804527	4807469	It's just... I don't know.
4807890	4808170	Alright.
4808484	4813126	Well, let's get into some rapid fire news and then we're going to get into some Twitter topics as well.
4813166	4815307	So you just have a few more minutes to get your Twitter topics in.
4815327	4818488	We have a few pouring into the Twitter already at OLR.
4818809	4819129	Porn?
4819449	4819709	What?
4819749	4820189	Poring.
4820429	4820729	Poring.
4820769	4821490	I just said it fast.
4821690	4821930	All right.
4822290	4824231	Loki, start us off with some quick news tonight.
4824511	4827252	Well, Activision surprised us.
4827372	4827932	Woo!
4828332	4831773	They have new download content coming out to DJ Hero.
4832793	4835573	Unfortunately, I don't give a flying fuck about it.
4835893	4837594	And this is really sad.
4837634	4840254	I mean, unless you're a fan of... But you've been asking for it for forever.
4840274	4841815	Oh, yes, I've been asking for it.
4841975	4845676	I was hoping that they would, I don't know, put out some good download content.
4846076	4846876	And granted, you know...
4847876	4852119	I guess if you like Eminem and Jay-Z, you probably would have bought the Renegade Edition.
4852459	4856422	I didn't, so I didn't, and therefore I'm not buying this either.
4856822	4861485	But for the sake of reporting it, I will tell you what three mixes they have in there.
4862065	4871872	Shake That mixed with Show Me What You Got, Without Me mixed with Encore, and Can I Get A mixed with Lose Yourself.
4872712	4884056	And I've watched the video previews of these, and let me just say, I'm about as excited about these songs as I have been describing these songs to you.
4884176	4886297	It's seriously awful.
4886557	4888558	Well, you're more of a trance guy anyway.
4888878	4893740	And yeah, that's fine, but I even gave the last extended mix pack, whatever, I gave that a chance.
4894380	4895621	And I didn't really...
4896141	4899986	Check out the... I downloaded the David Guetta stuff, but I haven't... I did.
4900046	4900707	I like that pack a lot.
4900727	4901869	I have not played those yet.
4902470	4903952	And maybe I'll go back to that, but...
4905276	4906316	I like the other pack too.
4907797	4910257	There was, what was it, Gorillaz and something?
4910437	4914838	Oh, All of Me and Radio Gaga.
4914938	4916838	That's my favorite song in the whole freaking game.
4916858	4918139	Those are the extended mix packs.
4918279	4920619	Yeah, that download mix.
4920859	4923580	I think Gorillaz song was in the other song in there.
4924000	4928661	But yeah, I realize Eminem, Jay-Z, they sell bazillions of albums.
4929461	4931083	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4950319	4951080	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4974554	4980678	It's like, seriously, when the fuck are you going to add some more download content and support this stuff?
4980958	4995407	But then again, we're talking Activision here, so really I've just got to wait for some sort of DJing game from Harmonix or EA before I get that real download content, because I sure as hell am not going to get it with Activision.
4995427	4997008	What about Scratch, the ultimate DJ?
4997388	4998849	Yeah, when's that coming out?
5026167	5027950	You get them for a dollar more!
5028110	5035921	That's right, they're sold as single downloads for 300 Wii Points, and that's a total of $9 for each.
5036001	5037684	So guess what, you get to pay the Wii Premium.
5040646	5041246	Okay, I'm done there.
5042826	5047127	Now, what is kind of neat is they're going to be adding a new way to navigate PlayStation Home.
5047627	5051168	Apparently, it's kind of a take of the cross-media bar.
5051768	5054729	And the way they're doing it is they're going to be able to go to different spaces.
5054749	5057849	Like, for example, you can favorite different spaces you like going to.
5058750	5063391	You can go to personal spaces, whatever.
5064071	5065651	I forgot that came out this week.
5065751	5070575	It'll be a lot quicker to bounce from one place to another without having to walk aimlessly through a bunch of empty places.
5070595	5072276	Can I do anything with the OLR club yet?
5072356	5073437	Which, by the way, is full.
5073617	5077901	I keep getting requests for the club, and unfortunately, I'm limited to 25 members.
5078901	5083925	I seriously get new requests to join the club every other day, which I'm flattered, and thank you all for wanting to join.
5084226	5085206	But unfortunately, it's full.
5085286	5091852	So until Sony will let us have, I don't know, 50 people, 100 people, all your apps are just sitting there waiting to be approved until...
5092652	5100615	I'm not rejecting them, I'm just not answering them because I'm hoping that one day Sony's going to say, hey, we're going to make clubs useful and now you can have 50 or 100 people in them.
5100635	5107358	They probably just can't physically handle that many people in one space at a time or in that close proximity.
5107378	5111999	That's a bunch of bull because if you go to the main space area, you can see more than 25 people there at a time.
5112099	5112479	No offense.
5112600	5116061	If that's Sony's line, I claim bullshit.
5116681	5118944	Yeah, but how many servers are running that one space?
5119805	5120185	I don't know.
5120305	5120786	Whatever.
5121226	5122027	They're just not doing it.
5122507	5123148	But you know what?
5123288	5126792	I'm not going on home either, so this doesn't mean anything to me as well.
5127673	5129475	I wonder if there's going to be a theme going on here.
5130316	5131317	But let's find out.
5132779	5133539	This is kind of neat.
5133940	5137524	Apparently people think that you're going to have the power of the PS3 in your pocket within three years.
5138424	5149748	Um, the group, um, Imagination Technologies, maker of the PowerVR chips, says, um, that, I guess, powers, like, you know, smartphones like iPhones, Android, and whatnot.
5150108	5154390	Uh, they said that they, um, you'll have graphics comparable to PS3 in three years.
5155230	5158731	And the reason is because they're designing the chips right now for that kind of stuff.
5159371	5159952	Uh, apparently...
5161893	5169358	They're working with different groups to license things like Apple, HTC, whatnot.
5169598	5184350	They're saying that in three years, Imagination says you're going to have a PS3 in your pocket and it's not going to be running at 480x340 resolution that most smartphones have now, but it's actually going to be like a 720p output via HDMI to a TV.
5186368	5191739	That would be something, a phone that outputs to a TV via HDMI.
5193383	5193804	Interesting.
5196929	5201512	Yeah, they go into a lot more detail, of course, on different technologies that are out there and stuff.
5201572	5217343	But you can only imagine, though, that as time goes on, I mean, the technology is just growing at a geometric rate that, of course, I can imagine us actually having that kind of technology soon within the next five years.
5218516	5232262	Well, yeah, that seems a little aggressive, seeing as if you go by the whole, like, Nintendo is one off from the, you know, consoles with their handhelds, meaning that the DS is kind of like a 64, just like the Advance was kind of like a Super Nintendo.
5232542	5235143	Then the next handheld from Nintendo will be kind of like a GameCube.
5235543	5237124	Funny that you mention that, actually.
5237304	5237404	Oh?
5237924	5240245	Oh, I have something that'll be for last-minute stories for that.
5240385	5241346	I can come right now if you want.
5241366	5241786	Why not?
5241846	5242446	Yes, please.
5242626	5243947	Please don't make me wait any longer.
5244007	5244567	I need to know.
5245047	5245587	I need to know.
5245627	5246068	I'm dying.
5247708	5249310	Apparently there's a rumor about DS2.
5249510	5251191	Of course, there's always a rumor about DS2.
5251271	5252953	There's always some damn rumor about DS2.
5253413	5272308	According to somebody's sources within GDC, I'm not going to read through the article to see who exactly is quoting here, that it's in the developers' hands, and apparently they're not having trouble developing for it because it's basically a GameCube, power-wise, and everyone knows how to develop for a GameCube because they've been doing it for quite a while with both the GameCube and the Wii.
5272328	5273549	Well, because the Wii is a GameCube, too.
5273669	5274330	Basically, yes.
5274950	5279411	The thing is it's going to be interesting.
5279791	5281832	Apparently the people are familiar with the dev kit.
5282192	5290674	It made it sound like there wasn't much learning curve on the new system and that devs who worked on GameCube or Wii games will find it easy to create with.
5291134	5301637	Also they said that apparently the system has a built-in accelerometer and two big higher resolution screens that are closer together so that they can more easily be used as one screen.
5302838	5302958	And
5304378	5308300	I like the idea of bringing the two screens closer together to make one big screen I think that's kind of cool
5332529	5334758	I wonder if they'll both be touch sensitive this time.
5336862	5337742	Possibly, right?
5337802	5338302	Yeah, why not?
5338622	5343083	And by the way, just pro tip, Nintendo, if it's going to run on GameCube-y type hardware, F-Zero.
5343523	5344744	Okay, thanks.
5345364	5352805	And just because it runs on GameCube type hardware does not mean that I want to see fucking ports of every single GameCube game that you guys put out.
5353265	5353545	Okay?
5353885	5354745	Do some new shit.
5355306	5355746	Seriously.
5356246	5357186	Unless it's Wind Waker.
5357266	5358386	Wind Waker I will accept.
5358746	5362047	The rest of them, except for F-Zero, I reject them all.
5363909	5373978	And for God's sake, please, you know, maybe add some more buttons to the face, like an analog stick or something like that so that we can actually play games in traditional sense.
5373998	5379083	Remember they used to have that, like, thumb stylus thing that you would have to strap to your finger that came with it?
5379103	5379944	Yes, yes, I do.
5380824	5380924	Ooh.
5380944	5381004	Ooh.
5410226	5434108	Hank Chien is his name he's a plastic surgeon from New York he has beaten Billy Mitchell's record Billy Mitchell by the way had 1,050,200 points Hank has scored 1,061,700 points officially verified by Twin Galaxies an original Donkey Kong cabinet machine in New York is how he said it congrats to him now he can star in the sequel
5435169	5435470	Great.
5435490	5435630	Great.
5454890	5455952	Thanks for watching!
5472652	5480058	I remember when we went to Classic Gaming Expo one year and they were doing like the official Twin Galaxies high score for I think it was Stampede on the 2600.
5480098	5481239	I remember that.
5481620	5482821	I played Stampede.
5482961	5485363	Dude, I think I was like last place for the day.
5485403	5487124	I was so fucking terrible at Stampede.
5487484	5490807	But the guy was trying to give me tips and stuff and what he was saying made a lot of sense.
5490847	5497673	But I was just like, wow, when I was a kid, I didn't think about these games like that, like the tips and everything he was trying to give me.
5497773	5500535	I was just like, I just tried to lasso the horse thingies.
5501716	5503037	Light Cycles Light Cycles
5530712	5532473	It's not so much good, it's just cool.
5533813	5535114	So Tron Legacy's coming out.
5535154	5539375	I gotta say, despite the fact that the expectation bar for the movies are very low, you know I'm gonna be seeing it opening day.
5540256	5541816	You know I'm gonna go, just like many of you.
5542516	5546218	The score by Daft Punk sounds awesome.
5546318	5548359	Like, what's a word that's better than awesome?
5548439	5549199	More awesome.
5549879	5550539	Super awesome.
5578792	5588914	It's very similar to, like, I've seen something similar in Rolling Stone that, like, had all these different band names as a picture, like somebody smashing a pumpkin.
5588934	5589875	See, I already did all these.
5589975	5590695	Things like that.
5590795	5591455	I already did all these.
5591475	5596556	Like, for example, GoldenEye, Star Fox, Seawolf.
5596756	5598277	I see Kongo Bongo there at the bottom.
5598517	5600357	No, that's actually Donkey Konga.
5600477	5600917	Frogger.
5600997	5601758	Because it's a donkey.
5602178	5603318	That's not a classic game.
5603838	5611122	Shadow of the Colossus, Frogger, Outrun That one right there is Birdie King, it's a golf game, TimeSplitters, Bomberman
5622887	5625729	No, I actually figured most of those out.
5625769	5636236	You can thank me putting together my main cabinet for being aware of all these different... Because a lot of the stuff I had themes for, my hyperspin stuff, so the names became familiar.
5637797	5642300	Actually, you can ask my co-worker because I sat there for the first hour that day that it came out.
5642680	5643861	During the day, just working on that.
5644021	5647223	SSJ100Matt says, it was a good B-movie.
5647323	5647864	Tron, that is.
5647904	5648924	That's a good way of defining it.
5649004	5651026	I like Tron for the same reason I like Showgirls.
5651486	5652767	It's so bad, it's good.
5652807	5654069	No, no, no, Tron is great.
5654129	5655211	You are a whore, darling.
5655732	5656994	I love Tron.
5657014	5658217	It's a good movie to me.
5658457	5658898	End of line.
5658918	5661422	Have you seen the game trailer for Tron Legacy?
5661502	5661863	I have.
5662284	5663987	Doesn't it remind you of Force Unleashed?
5665781	5667342	I wasn't thinking of it that way, but yeah.
5667442	5669703	I love the old school Tron arcade game, man.
5669723	5670343	That was awesome.
5670583	5674685	But of course, it's one of those things that's better left in my memory because when I played it on an Xbox Live, I was kind of like, eh.
5675785	5678946	Well, and Tron and Discs of Tron are actually at the bottom of that page, too.
5679067	5679467	Are they really?
5679647	5679727	Yeah.
5679807	5684229	All right, anyhow, Actdeft also says it was Empire Magazine that did that collage I'm thinking of.
5684269	5685469	It's probably been done a couple times.
5685509	5686970	I want to say there's a movie one out there, too.
5687150	5687350	Yeah.
5687530	5689551	Anyhow, who cares about all of this news?
5689611	5691552	I'll tell you what the biggest news of the week is.
5691632	5693212	This is gigantic news.
5693252	5694193	This is epic news.
5694273	5694613	This is...
5695733	5697835	I can't believe we didn't lead the show off with this news tonight.
5698355	5700056	Lady Gaga is coming to Rock Band.
5700096	5700616	Yes, that's right.
5700656	5710922	Lady Gaga will be coming on to Rock Band with a four-pack of songs, including Just Dance, Bad Romance, Poker Face, and Monster.
5711242	5712023	But that's not all.
5712343	5714744	There is a bonus fifth song you're going to be able to get.
5714765	5718867	You're going to be able to get the Eric Cartman version of Poker Face.
5718887	5720028	It's the only reason to get it.
5722631	5726193	And the best part about it is he is playing the song in rock band in the show.
5739008	5740748	and Living Rooms Across America.
5741049	5742269	I will be buying all these tracks.
5742309	5746890	I will be buying every single one of them because I am such a huge stan for Lady Gaga.
5746910	5747530	It's not even funny.
5750731	5752091	Hey, you even told me you like Bad Romance.
5752111	5753032	That's one of the four songs.
5753652	5756152	I know, but I don't know that I like it enough to buy it on Rock Band.
5757313	5758593	I'll stick with Rush, thank you.
5759173	5759613	Fair enough.
5759813	5760614	Hey, Rush is cool.
5760654	5761354	I can't deny that.
5761374	5765155	It's just Lady Gaga is, just like I said before, more awesomer.
5765495	5765755	All right.
5767768	5771389	Seriously though, how about some other last minute stories, DarkSakura?
5771449	5772069	Last minute?
5773189	5773969	I'm sorry, not last minute.
5774009	5775269	It's a quick, whatever.
5775770	5777470	Too many segments on this damn show.
5777530	5778850	Just read a story.
5778890	5779650	I don't care what it is.
5779690	5780470	Just read something.
5780570	5781411	Once upon a time, what?
5781431	5781951	Today, Shermie pooped.
5782411	5782631	Oh, goody.
5782691	5783791	And I cleaned it out of her box.
5784931	5788712	Actually, I do have to say, the poop situation is over.
5789712	5789832	Oh?
5790392	5791413	Did you find out what happened?
5791453	5793213	An update on Shermie's bowel movements.
5794596	5795457	She's just an old lady.
5796237	5798058	She couldn't get in her cat box, it was too deep.
5798719	5800960	We got her a shallower one, changed her litter, she's happy.
5801220	5803721	Does she need kitty depends or anything?
5803741	5805042	No, I'm not putting cat diapers on her.
5805562	5806823	No kitty insurer in her?
5808364	5809905	I did buy her cat grass and she's happy.
5812086	5813307	For anybody that was wondering.
5813827	5816428	Thank you everyone who is concerned over my cat's poop.
5817769	5819570	So, you remember the game Hotel Dusk?
5820563	5825471	Also, I haven't talked about the tester on this show in a few weeks, which I've watched every episode of the tester.
5825511	5826994	You did talk about it last week.
5827114	5827756	Oh, never mind then.
5828056	5828978	Can I finish?
5829459	5830200	Okay, yes you can.
5830861	5831783	You remember Hotel Dusk?
5833620	5839464	The company that made it, Sing, is over 200 million in debt.
5841125	5849490	They also did Another Code, they did Town Factory for Little King Story, and Last Window.
5850230	5856334	And we better buy some more of their copies of Again, which is coming out at the end of this month, because that was also by them, I think.
5856774	5858836	They filed for bankruptcy on March 1st.
5858856	5859896	200 million yen.
5862537	5864758	So we need to sell 200 million copies of that game.
5864798	5865459	I know you can do it.
5866979	5875024	The final new character for Street Fighter 4 has been released, and it's a big red dude covered in oil, wearing what looks like a hat made out of Legos on his head.
5876545	5881387	And he's a grappler, and he slides, and he's splashing oil everywhere.
5881487	5884189	This is actually kind of splooge-worthy, so...
5885724	5886846	I gotta give props to Alan.
5886886	5888528	He recognized what they were referencing.
5888568	5889849	He's a Turkish oil wrestler.
5890189	5899660	It's this big thing in other countries, like Turkey, where they douse themselves in what appears to be KY jelly type of substance and wrestle each other.
5900241	5902604	It is pretty homo-rific, but no homo.
5903885	5904665	I've heard of it.
5904725	5907267	It's just the screen capture is like, dude, you're red.
5907407	5909048	Isn't that Greco-Roman normally?
5909328	5909648	What's that?
5909748	5910508	Isn't that like Greco-Roman?
5910528	5911149	That's a Roman.
5911589	5912290	Oh, I don't know.
5912310	5915992	He told me to Google image search Turkish oil wrestling.
5916572	5921095	And let's just say I got a lot of guys who didn't look quite as bad as that guy.
5922415	5923556	Okay.
5923596	5925077	Especially not wearing a blue Lego hat.
5926718	5929260	Also, I can never pronounce his last name right.
5929320	5929960	Is it Molyneux?
5934247	5960059	whatever crazy guy who makes Fable yeah really basically he's saying that comparing Natal and Move he said Move is a good step in the right direction but it's not as big as Natal and he thinks he's not biased or anything well says first party developer for Microsoft he's saying that Move is going to be more for the casual market and Natal is going to be more for the immersive gamer
5962354	5964655	Fable 3 will blow your mind!
5965175	5966015	Except it won't.
5966055	5968236	It'll be exactly like the last two games.
5968736	5972477	But he'll claim that it blows your mind.
5972497	5973078	It blows you.
5973098	5974618	You're supposed to have no heads up, though.
5974998	5975698	No heads up display.
5978759	5987302	I'm interested to see what the Natal link-in is, but they do say that Natal is not mandatory for Fable 3, which I also like.
5987362	5988842	It will allow you to slap a bitch.
5989203	5990083	laughter
5995942	5998925	Oh Loki, what would we do without you here at Orange Lounge Radio?
5998945	6000887	We would die, that's what would happen, we would die.
6001287	6002308	How about some Twitter topics?
6003189	6003829	Speaking of death.
6005070	6006472	No, actually we have some good questions tonight.
6006492	6008974	We have some really good questions on the Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
6009915	6017281	I'm going to allow, usually I don't allow more than one question a person, but MNZiba has a couple good ones tonight, so I will grant an exception.
6017842	6020685	MNZiba asking, what is the deal with the Chocobo?
6020765	6022346	What is the deal with the Chocobo?
6023089	6025990	with the Chocobo in Final Fantasy XIII.
6026510	6031071	Is there a use for it or is it just there to look cute and to make it a Final Fantasy game?
6031711	6033132	I think it's a little bit the second part.
6033232	6043435	It is there to look cute and make it a little more of a Final Fantasy game because since there is no world map type thing, they had to incorporate a Chocobo, I think, another way.
6043875	6047376	One big bitch about the game, by the way, is that there's no Final Fantasy victory music.
6047536	6048076	You never hear...
6048436	6050458	Thank you for watching!
6067037	6067937	See if you can read what's going on.
6068297	6071378	All the characters have their little profiles with the datalog.
6071618	6073979	The Chocobo has his own entry.
6074399	6078760	So I don't know if maybe the Chocobo becomes more relevant later in the story, but he's awfully cute.
6078860	6079941	I want a fat Chocobo.
6080741	6081481	To hold your items?
6081701	6082641	Yeah, to hold my items.
6082921	6084802	It'd be awesome if he was a playable character later on.
6086933	6091735	and MNZ, but since I'm allowing the second tweet tonight, says, this should be the game for the Sweet Off.
6092476	6094557	The Swedish Armed Forces, the team test.
6094577	6097078	Remember we were talking about the Sweet Off with one of our callers last week?
6097538	6100539	Well, there's this, I've never even heard of this.
6100559	6103961	We just got a link here to the Swedish Armed Forces team test.
6105121	6108163	and I guess it's some type of online little ranking thing.
6108223	6111765	I'll have to look into this and see if it's appropriate for the Sweet Off but I don't know.
6111785	6121432	Part of me is like the Sweet Off should happen with President Cat or Beatmania 2DX or something a little more showish or OLR Match Game.
6121612	6124273	I think we have to do OLR Match Game for the Sweet Off.
6124293	6127195	I think that's just mandatory but I appreciate the suggestion.
6127235	6127716	Don't get me wrong.
6128616	6136859	TigerClaw links us to a story on 1UP about Ensemble and Pandemic talking about their company closures.
6137340	6139961	They're actually taking responsibility and blaming themselves.
6141041	6145863	According to the 1UP article, Paul Bettner, he was an employee of Ensemble Studios for 12 years.
6145903	6147504	Of course, it was shut down by Microsoft in 2008.
6148044	6150465	He blamed their own internal crunch culture.
6150845	6168634	saying quote the reality is that every single game we shipped took twice as long as we said it was going to take and cost twice as much to make Microsoft is a public company they answer to their shareholders and we were simply too expensive kind of an interesting little article kind of interesting to hear folks taking responsibility for what happened
6169714	6171315	It's a rarity nowadays.
6171415	6173176	It is a rarity nowadays, but still kind of a bummer.
6173556	6175837	By the way, when the show is bad, it's never my fault.
6175997	6177398	Always Loki's.
6178438	6179619	That means it's never my fault either.
6180199	6181079	It's a rarity nowadays.
6181160	6183020	I blame Shermie's butt.
6184001	6187122	Nico Nico Chan links us to a website.
6187182	6188023	I think this might be a...
6188743	6190724	I think this might be a website plug, I don't know, but I'll read it.
6191104	6193525	PokemonRO.net, what do you think about it?
6193985	6198687	It's like Red Blue made from Ragnarok Online system and skills, but with a ton of customs.
6198727	6199547	Jamie apparently knows it.
6199647	6199867	Yes.
6200308	6200448	And?
6200648	6201108	We'll play.
6201928	6202528	We'll play.
6203069	6203529	We'll play.
6203789	6205089	A++, we'll play again.
6206110	6214853	Right now, right now, I hardly have time to play anything, but this I will when my brain works and I have time.
6214893	6215633	Gonna make some time.
6216234	6216834	Gonna make some time.
6217310	6219111	in between killing the Klingons and Gorn.
6220632	6225195	Spazinator PSN says, okay, since it's pie day, here's a random question.
6225315	6227597	Pizza or Boston cream?
6228117	6230479	See, I get what he's doing there because they call it pizza pie.
6230739	6232400	They don't really call it pizza pie here.
6232420	6234061	At least I never hear that term, but yeah.
6234081	6234502	Boston cream.
6234522	6235763	Because it's less deep dish here.
6236583	6237163	Boston cream.
6238304	6244927	Um, I do love Boston Cream Pies, but it's like, I'll still always have pumpkins, so I've gotta go for pizza.
6244967	6248488	Like, if you're asking me one pie versus all of pizza, I've gotta go for pizza.
6248508	6250029	And Boston Cream Pie, though, is more of a cake.
6251869	6254890	I mean, really, it's a cake with a cream layer in it.
6255671	6257511	But you still elect Boston Cream over pizza.
6257531	6259312	I don't know, I really love Boston Cream Pie.
6260092	6261373	I had it for breakfast last week.
6262516	6263637	Let's see.
6264277	6269540	Ryan Belknap is wishing us a happy Pi Day, but he's also trying to imitate a spammer.
6269560	6270360	I see what you're doing there.
6270921	6272302	These are Twitter folks.
6273382	6278525	It's SSJ100Matt on Twitter, but his Twitter name is Matt Ostrofsky, which I always mispronounce.
6278905	6282367	Dr. Love himself, Gene Simmons, will be voicing Guitar Hero 6.
6283247	6284728	Could it be Guitar Hero Kiss?
6284988	6287290	Somehow this missed the show tonight, but I remember reading about this.
6287850	6289871	Apparently Gene Simmons has said he's doing Guitar Hero 6.
6290131	6293752	I can see him being the voice of Guitar Hero just because he said he's the voice of Guitar Hero.
6308957	6309698	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6328075	6329595	He's whoring himself out, okay?
6329715	6330976	That's really what it comes down to.
6332076	6334096	He was on The Celebrity Apprentice, for heaven's sakes.
6334156	6337317	I mean, that's where celebrities go because they need attention.
6337377	6337957	And you know what?
6338017	6338317	Cool.
6338357	6339817	He can be in the next Guitar Hero game.
6339857	6342518	Just don't be pissed off if he's singing Kelly Clarkson.
6342578	6343098	Can't wait.
6343258	6346079	Can't wait for the YouTubes of Gene Simmons singing Taylor Swift.
6347159	6349299	You belong to me.
6350259	6353380	Anyhow, that was my Taylor Swift impression, by the way.
6355501	6357801	Or Lady Gaga or something like that.
6360007	6360727	That would be hilarious.
6360767	6361067	Can't wait.
6361107	6361928	In the full makeup.
6362568	6365049	You belong to me.
6365749	6366969	Yes, Taylor Swift sings like a Muppet.
6367890	6372771	Lastly, on the OLR Twitter, Bricktone asks us, and this is kind of a fragmented question.
6372911	6374972	Apparently, he was challenged with 140 characters.
6375412	6377093	Support for PS3 Crash?
6377233	6380774	Well, I don't support the PS3 Crash, but...
6382679	6384360	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6406525	6407446	Thanks for watching!
6424009	6425609	And lastly, what do you think of the Wiimote for PS3?
6425809	6428050	Well, again, I think we talked about that a little bit earlier in the show.
6428110	6432351	I think it's a necessary step for Sony, but it's an unnecessary peripheral for me to buy right now.
6432471	6433131	That's where I'm at.
6433411	6437232	Until I see that must-have game, I'm not sold.
6437692	6446634	And I don't know what that must-have game is, but it's not like Sony can't create a new IP, because like LittleBigPlanet, hello, that is like a system seller PS3 game.
6446654	6447414	It is that good.
6447714	6449735	You know, Uncharted is that good.
6449835	6450995	Speaking of LittleBigPlanet, you still...
6451075	6456301	Did you see the video of how exactly the PlayStation Move works into LittleBigPlanet?
6456321	6457282	I'm gonna be honest, no.
6457362	6459144	I just heard it's compatible.
6459605	6460205	Did it look good?
6460866	6461006	No.
6461346	6467173	It's basically, you know how in Super Mario Galaxy the other players control a cursor or whatever and they can shoot shit?
6467513	6471338	Well, this one, you basically control a cursor and you can move shit.
6473490	6474530	Well, you know what?
6474550	6477311	It might add another element to level design, and I'm all for it.
6477631	6485494	Again, where I give major, major props to Media Molecule and Sony is that they're not milking LittleBigPlanet for a 2 and 3 and 4.
6486134	6490315	They keep making the first game better and making it so much more of a value.
6490415	6491856	So it's hard to be mad.
6493234	6493615	You know what?
6493735	6494616	It's another feature.
6494736	6495676	It's just one I probably don't use.
6495696	6500480	I'd like to think of it as a continuously evolving experience.
6500500	6501621	God, I wish more games were like it.
6501641	6502221	And you know what?
6502322	6506325	I think that they could do a little bit of Planet 2, but just release it as a download pack.
6506885	6508326	Oh, look, new levels set.
6508486	6513110	Do you think maybe just Mod Nation racers will probably have it too at some point?
6513170	6519055	Just wasn't ready to show yet, like gripping the steering wheel with your, you know, not Wiimote, you know?
6519755	6520816	I'm sure it's inevitable.
6522464	6523425	Thanks for the tweets, guys.
6523465	6525026	Twitter.com slash OLR.
6525086	6525766	Give us a follow.
6525806	6526667	We really appreciate it.
6526967	6529689	And by the way, I also wanted to say this at some point in the show tonight.
6529749	6534412	We really do appreciate five-star reviews on iTunes and people that help spread the word.
6534652	6540776	Because you know we do say at the end of every show, you know, tell a friend or two about the show and help spread the word about Orange Launch Radio.
6540796	6544219	That's really all we ask to continue doing this show for you guys.
6544519	6550163	And I just wanted to say there were a couple of really, really nice reviews left on iTunes this week.
6550223	6552084	I wanted to read them because they were very, very nice.
6552464	6554908	Even with last week's show?
6555208	6556189	Even with last week's show.
6556209	6557631	These were both left in the past week.
6558012	6561196	A short and sweet one from Bert777 saying, I love it.
6561216	6562198	Been listening for a while.
6562538	6565001	Anybody into video games, give these awesome people a chance.
6565042	6565742	So thank you, Bert.
6566524	6567345	Hope Ernie's doing well.
6568366	6569166	But I want to read this one.
6569186	6570147	This is just sweet.
6570187	6573910	This gave me the awe feeling and really makes doing the show worthwhile.
6573970	6580836	Shadow77 says, I've been listening to OLR for at least three years and over time they went from being a good podcast to an epic podcast.
6581177	6584700	They are opinionated and well informed on video game matters and to top it off are really funny.
6585080	6590565	Over time they have honed their broadcasting skills and their radio voices and have become a podcast that I would actually pay money to hear.
6590925	6592826	They do go off on tangents quite often though.
6592927	6593247	Choo choo.
6593847	6622812	this is a plus to me but always manage to wrap something up about video games into the subject they are always current about the video game industry and run the gamut on topics from reviews to previews to info on various video game developers and publishers to things random to describe the live show is something to experience and they actually pay attention to the chat room and take calls the community is also fairly active so I just wanted to say thank you because you know people take the time out to write these nice reviews and I realize yeah it's a little bit of ego stroking and so forth but I actually read that and it made me go
6623152	6624032	Aw, that's really nice.
6624193	6626714	Like, somebody didn't have to say all that, and they did.
6626834	6629755	And I just wanted to share the awes.
6630135	6630775	So thank you very much.
6632316	6633897	Again, those are five-star reviews from iTunes.
6634077	6637839	And, of course, you know, all we ask... I realize not everybody's on the Apple bandwagon.
6637899	6643001	Like, if I ask Loki to leave a five-star review on iTunes, he'd tell me to play hide-and-go-fuck myself from last week's show.
6643741	6645622	So just tell friends about the show.
6645662	6646182	That's all we ask.
6646222	6647503	I don't go on iTunes.
6647883	6648403	I know you don't.
6648603	6650744	You know, that's against my... You can rate them on Zune, too.
6651265	6652045	Just so you know.
6654522	6655523	Anyhow, let's move on.
6655563	6657083	Some actual video gaming news.
6657103	6661586	Let's get past the ego stroking and get to some more video game news because there's plenty of it still to go.
6662102	6666144	More stuff coming out from this week.
6667504	6669045	There's actually some information.
6669065	6671566	We talked a little bit about Natal and whatnot.
6671966	6675007	But I can't forget about XNA.
6675728	6681410	XNA Game Studio 4.0 apparently is including support for Windows phones.
6682290	6686572	And they're even going to be including some new features including...
6687052	6692975	Gamertags, Avatar support, and achievements that you can unlock on your phone.
6693475	6698858	That's right, there's going to be games that you can use for unlocking achievements.
6699238	6701079	Kind of like an Xbox Live Arcade game.
6701699	6706462	In fact, you can unlock up to 200 Microsoft or Gamerscore points.
6707362	6713085	And I guess it's going to be displayed on your Xbox Live Gamertag profile.
6714511	6714931	Achievement Whores
6741499	6770398	well you know sometimes achievements like that gets people to buy the games well there was a whole study out of GDC again it's not on the show world tonight but there was a whole thing on achievements and it does motivate people to play games and there's a percentage of people it's a small percentage but a percentage that really try to go after every single achievement in a game you know and will buy games with achievements didn't they say too that games with really easy achievements especially in arcade will sell a little more often times
6771810	6772892	So hey, why not?
6773073	6778944	If it's a way to draw attention to the Windows phone, anything to pull the eyes away from Apple for a minute, I think is a good idea.
6781280	6781580	Alright.
6782741	6785361	Would this get you on board with a Windows phone though, Loki?
6785441	6787002	Since I know you're not going to get an iPhone anytime soon.
6787022	6789102	No, because the data plans on phones are too expensive.
6789342	6797224	And it's just... You know, if they brought down... If it was like $50 a month for unlimited data and everything, then maybe.
6797244	6799064	Because that's what I kind of pay for my phone right now.
6799104	6801625	But even then, I don't use that many minutes right now.
6801665	6807887	And I'm actually thinking about going to a prepaid phones where I don't have to... You know, like $100 a year type stuff.
6808087	6808727	You know, where...
6810047	6814770	Literally, I'm lucky if I use 6 to 12 minutes a month.
6816371	6820214	Well, somebody is teasing me yet again with the idea of a new Kid Icarus game.
6820254	6823636	Remember about a year or two ago when we were convinced this was coming out at E3?
6823676	6826278	We had the screenshots and everything, and it just didn't fucking happen?
6826838	6827299	How sad.
6827639	6837385	Well, again, we get teased, and you can kind of thank Kotaku for that, but really it was because they were interviewing Yoshio Sakamoto, who of course was one of the creators of Kid Icarus.
6837666	6839627	I guess they cornered him at GDC or something.
6840187	6855978	and basically he said in a nutshell that you know they're not opposed to bringing out Kid Icarus to the Wii they just don't know what to do here's the quote quote I don't know personally about any project underway regarding Kid Icarus but if so many of these people are interested in it and really want to see it on the Wii they should really speak up
6858259	6858899	Are they deaf?
6858999	6862140	Because I think a lot of people have been speaking up for a while.
6862180	6862821	But okay, whatever.
6863181	6865202	Do we need to do a petition online?
6865642	6866722	Is that what needs to happen?
6867382	6867963	Good gosh.
6868163	6869303	I'm sure there's plenty already.
6870924	6872064	Again, moving on with a quote.
6872124	6879328	Quote, if we can find some sort of way to bring it to the Wii, a way to make the game for the Wii that makes sense, we would happily do so.
6879668	6882329	But just keep in mind, it may not be me making the game.
6882969	6885110	So in other words, he's admitting it might be somebody else.
6885350	6904055	just like how Metroid Other M is in somebody else's hands and so forth honestly I think if they want to do a Kid Icarus game on the Wii why not just do like a souped up version a la even I hate to say it because I received this game so tepidly but maybe the Blaster Master game just a little more polished or the just like the Mario new Super Mario Bros.
6904115	6913998	Wii you don't have to like totally reinvent Kid Icarus just you know make it a fancy looking 2D game with some new features that's all you really need to do I think
6916505	6919127	I want the most epic Kid Icarus ever.
6937140	6937641	I do too.
6938181	6950373	You know, and especially, you would think with God of War, which is another Greek mythology thing, doing very well on another platform, you think Nintendo would already have some ideas on how you can make the Greek mythology thing successful.
6950793	6951153	I know.
6951213	6952475	How about Battle of Olympus, anyone?
6952535	6953095	Battle of Olympus?
6953355	6957399	Well, how about something else, though, that is kind of epic-ish?
6957720	6957920	Okay.
6958837	6960258	Hanabi Festival!
6960859	6961819	Yay!
6963641	6967824	But Nintendo raised some prices for some of their games.
6968725	6972368	Ironclad is now 1,000 Wii points instead of 900, and Lode Runner is 600 instead of 500.
6975190	6989159	Um, there's Military Madness, um, for WiiWare, which will be a thousand Wii points, and then the rest is DSiWare, um, Pop Island, uh, Simply Mahjong, Simply Sudoku, um, each of those will be 200, uh...
6992062	6998550	DSI Points 4 Travelers Play Spanish Elementary Masters Fantasy Card Adventure 800 DSI Points
7008959	7009299	Wee!
7009319	7017144	Seems like they got a lot of the big stuff out last year, but of course Rondo of Blood is kind of the big one that everybody's like, ooh, Rondo of Blood.
7017605	7020446	That means I don't have to worry about accidentally scratching my disc.
7020486	7022228	I wonder if that means it's going to come out here, too.
7022328	7022728	I hope.
7022808	7029112	I know you're reading it for Europe and what they get, but they sometimes get cooler stuff than we do, so I hope it means we're going to get it around the same time.
7029312	7029812	Want!
7030993	7033715	It might be, Dark Sakura, it could be tomorrow.
7034235	7035156	It could be tomorrow.
7035856	7036797	I know, I know.
7038556	7040117	I want next week to be here already.
7040197	7041118	Not just because of PAX.
7041178	7042859	Not this coming week, but the week after.
7042919	7044920	Not just because of PAX East, but Microsoft Game Room.
7045280	7047861	I've seen some of the clips from GDC for Microsoft Game Room.
7047881	7048882	Looks kind of cool.
7049422	7050283	I'm excited to try it.
7050323	7053204	Here's my question, though, about the Hanabi Festival.
7053245	7055286	Just because you guys are getting all excited and everything.
7056887	7061449	One of the years they did bring that stuff over here, but not last year, I don't think.
7061789	7062710	It was only in Europe.
7063584	7066506	Well, it seems like they don't bring all the games over here.
7066627	7076995	Well, no, I guess they did do a festival out of it, because I want to say they brought Sin and Punishment over here, which was a big deal, because in the back of their minds, they knew the sequel was coming.
7077135	7081559	We didn't know that yet, but they knew it was, so they brought that out during a similar thing here.
7081579	7083580	Yeah, Sin and Punishment came out over here, and I think Mario Bros.
7083780	7084641	2 did also.
7084781	7086022	Yeah, I think you're right.
7086422	7089545	The original Mario 2, you're right, was part of that too.
7089585	7093128	Well, maybe they'll do it again here, but I'm not going to hold my breath either.
7094288	7094728	So we'll see.
7094748	7097449	A couple more stories for you guys, then we're going to get to the mailbag.
7097589	7107411	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Well, this is kind of an interesting tie-in, but apparently Mafia 2 will feature vintage Playboys.
7107891	7108551	That's right.
7109051	7115753	2K Games has announced that they've signed a license agreement with the Playboy magazine for, I guess they're going to have...
7117854	7122797	50 of the vintage covers and centerfolds inside the game when it's released.
7122817	7126319	So I guess you'll see vintage Playboys littered on the ground and stuff like that.
7127480	7139007	Also, I guess the Playboy collectibles won't show up until the later part of the game because I guess the game takes place during the 40s and 50s.
7139928	7142069	And apparently the magazine...
7143070	7144211	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7167671	7167951	Nice.
7168452	7171575	And are they actual Playboy vintage covers?
7171655	7172175	That's kind of cool.
7172195	7173717	They will be the actual covers.
7174017	7174418	Wow.
7175138	7180383	So they're gonna... I don't know if they have... It says they have the centerfolds as well, so I don't know if you get the cover in the centerfold.
7180824	7182566	It's a little bit of nudity for you, but...
7184187	7184387	Neat.
7184587	7188390	Hey, adding some tits to your game always makes it sell a few more copies, so there you go.
7188410	7194314	And I do believe that they had a character from Mafia 2 in the last digital fake game check.
7194374	7195614	Oh, they still do that, huh?
7195855	7196855	Yeah, they still do it.
7196875	7197416	The fake girls.
7197736	7198376	Eh, it's retarded.
7198496	7199337	Yeah, a little silly.
7200376	7211411	Alright, on the PSP, maybe this system can render some nice looking titties, I don't know That should be the question we ask about a new engine You know how we always say with a new peripheral, what's the time to penis?
7212392	7215517	With new game engines, we should always ask, what's the time for realistic boobs?
7216057	7216358	I don't know
7216738	7219560	Anyhow, I think this system is very capable of doing it.
7219600	7220901	It's the Fire Engine.
7220921	7223063	That's P-H-Y-R-E Engine.
7223923	7227106	Right now, this is a tool that's used for creating PS3 games.
7227166	7230228	It was used to make Critter Crunch, Flower, Shatter.
7230528	7233730	Well, apparently now this is going to be compatible with the PSP.
7234431	7240435	Big announcement at Game Developers Conference, which makes sense because the people developing games want to know that they can make games like Critter Crunch on the PSP.
7240815	7241316	I gotta say...
7242031	7243972	Flower, awesome looking game.
7244032	7247874	That is one of the most beautiful games you will play on a next-gen system, period.
7248294	7250735	Critter Crunch looks like a freaking cartoon.
7251075	7251675	Really well done.
7251715	7254917	So it's kind of exciting to hear that this Fire Engine is coming to the PSP.
7256137	7271304	One of the VPs of technology, Taji Yutaka, said, Fire Engine for PSP was developed in response to requests from the game developer community, and we hope that the release of the PSP version demonstrates our commitment and support for game developers on all platforms.
7271704	7277249	begin counting down the time until Critter Crunch and Flower are announced on the PSP.
7277529	7284916	Because I'll bet you anything, both of those games being as well-received as they were, getting PSP ports in a matter of three, two, one.
7285316	7286417	Yeah, wait for E3.
7287658	7288039	Anyhow.
7289153	7293076	Now's the part of the show where DarkSakura is going to take an adventure into the mailbag.
7293096	7295938	She's going to jump in, pull out some emails, and read them for you here.
7296579	7297340	It's the mailbag.
7297480	7303685	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com DarkSakura, who's emailing us this week?
7303945	7304765	Two from Robaba.
7306776	7317064	Now that the following terms are allowed in Xbox Live gamer tags, lesbian, gay, bi, transgender, straight, I think that Microsoft has the golden opportunity for avatar clothing and props of the LGBT.
7317904	7321047	It's not an official 2010 prediction, but I'm pretty sure they will.
7321587	7323809	Any takers or am I taking too much for granted?
7324689	7326451	In other news, did you hear about Washington, D.C.
7326511	7327491	has made gay marriage legal?
7328252	7330594	Next thing you know, some guy will try to marry his virtual girlfriend.
7330694	7331074	Oh, wait.
7332866	7335268	Yes, I did hear about DC making it legal.
7335308	7336610	So congratulations, DC.
7336670	7342154	And I made a mistake because I tweeted about it when it happens and I was like, what state's going to be next?
7342214	7342955	Come on, guys.
7343015	7344396	It's time to get the other states on board.
7344416	7349120	And then I realized like literally five seconds after hitting submit, I was like, oh, DC's not a state.
7349621	7353284	But still, it's an important part of the nation, obviously.
7353804	7357287	And very glad to hear that they have stopped marriage discrimination.
7357928	7358048	Yep.
7358683	7359063	Good for them.
7359884	7368190	As far as the other part of that, the part relating to gaming more about how long before I can get a rainbow sticker or a rainbow belt for my character, I don't know.
7368690	7373814	I think a lot of it is about supply and demand and I don't know if there's just a huge demand for that.
7374435	7377817	I don't think that Microsoft's gonna be really trying to sell that anytime soon.
7377917	7378238	I don't know.
7378338	7379498	I think it would be a little while.
7380299	7386104	I just don't think there's enough out there in the Avatar marketplace where they need that stuff right now.
7386204	7389647	I mean, yeah, they have sports jerseys, but I don't know.
7390748	7396293	Then again, they had the politically motivated icons a couple years ago when the 08 election happened.
7396313	7401978	I want to say they had their own little Xbox poll because there were Obama icons and McCain icons.
7402418	7402618	Right?
7402678	7403219	Am I crazy?
7403259	7406662	Wasn't there some type of unscientific poll they did?
7407683	7408023	I don't know.
7409437	7414886	I don't know if they'd want to do such a social issue on the marketplace I don't realistically see that happening
7415536	7416017	Oh, no.
7416537	7422802	Also, from the Disney Parks log, the monorails are going to feature Tron Legacy art.
7423883	7424503	That's pretty cool.
7424703	7425184	Nice.
7425284	7429147	Like, all the Disney Parks are going to be Tron-tronatized?
7429307	7430608	I'm looking at the Disney Parks.
7430908	7432649	It's the... It's Disney World.
7433450	7433830	Oh, wow.
7433850	7434371	That's so cool.
7435151	7440075	The monorails at Disneyland just got redone not that long ago, so I can't believe they'd be doing them again.
7440095	7441396	Tell me this picture's not sweet.
7441736	7444158	Oh, it's just like a little paint job on the outside.
7444178	7445039	It's still pretty cool, though.
7445709	7447214	Yeah, that's pretty neat.
7447415	7447916	You know what they need?
7447936	7449180	It'd be even cooler if they did.
7449782	7450705	Noby Noby Boy.
7452907	7456970	No, seriously though, speaking of Tron and Disneyland, because I can bring this back on point.
7457330	7463674	The coolest fucking ride I remember from when I was a kid, the People Mover featuring Tron.
7464215	7474842	They had the People Mover, which they had for years and years, but in the early 80s when the movie came out, there was a section of it that was the super speed tunnel, where basically they projected imageries of Tron really fast on the wall.
7475142	7476403	So it was a visual trick.
7476423	7480406	It was an optical illusion that made you feel like you were going like 60 miles an hour in this tunnel.
7480626	7480966	and DarkSakura.
7507618	7511101	Then, there was the Rocket Rods, which were really super fast.
7511621	7514003	Still had the Tron Tunnel, but it was like, SHOOM!
7514183	7516345	Through the Tron Tunnel, and it was hard to see anything.
7518446	7519828	I never rode Rocket Rods, sadly.
7519848	7520648	I didn't go to Disneyland for many years.
7520668	7524231	But, someone also somehow managed to fall out of that thing and died.
7524711	7526693	So, people are dumb.
7527113	7528234	That's what it comes down to.
7528254	7531757	That's why they don't have the gondolas anymore, because someone fell out of it and died.
7532257	7536981	It's always people acting like jackasses, falling out of things and dying.
7537902	7540705	The chat room has a request for me real quick here.
7541265	7544248	Like a genuine, bonafide, electrified six-car monorail.
7544569	7547392	When I say monorail, what's it called?
7547552	7548113	Monorail.
7548153	7549814	That's right, monorail.
7549894	7550195	Monorail.
7552853	7554814	I hear those things are awfully loud.
7554874	7556776	It flies as softly as a cloud.
7556976	7558737	Is there a chance the track could bend?
7559097	7560779	Not on your life, my Hindu friend.
7561039	7563000	What about us brain-dead slobs?
7563140	7564962	You'll be given cushy jobs.
7565102	7566943	Were you sent here by the devil?
7567103	7568804	No, good sir, I'm on the level.
7568964	7570906	The ring came off my pudding can.
7571126	7572867	Take my penknife, my good man.
7572887	7574929	I swear it's Springfield's only choice.
7574949	7576970	Throw up your hands and raise your voice.
7577250	7578071	Mother Earth!
7578131	7579052	What's it called?
7579212	7580192	Mother Earth!
7580252	7581173	Once again.
7581253	7581874	Mother Earth!
7585268	7585809	Manil!
7585889	7586250	Manil!
7586290	7586610	Manil!
7586630	7586971	Manil!
7587051	7587832	Manil!
7587852	7588333	Manil!
7588353	7588693	Manil!
7600250	7601771	Phil Hartman was a great man.
7602992	7603472	He's missed.
7604573	7604913	All right.
7605734	7607515	Anyhow, sorry for the tangent.
7607675	7608756	More emails, please?
7609076	7609316	Yes.
7610237	7610957	The Twitch?
7610977	7611178	Okay.
7611198	7612298	Hopefully they involve monorails.
7613179	7615240	Good morning, Orange Lounge Radio.
7615681	7617342	This is Jetus writing in again.
7617982	7622865	I have quite a few things to cover today, so first I'd like to thank DarkSakura for reading my previous long email and this one as well.
7622925	7623786	I really appreciate it.
7624386	7628909	I am also sorry for any spelling errors or grammatical faults in my letters, which there are undoubtedly many.
7629009	7629670	Yeah, but you're forgiven.
7630630	7631891	Now, on to more pressing matters.
7632311	7634071	Ake Ripper is THE Swede.
7634772	7639393	I should be the OTHER Swede, since I am still just a private in the UL Army.
7639753	7641434	Aw, don't give up like that.
7641514	7643555	Come on, where's my epic battle?
7643675	7645155	Where's my Swede throwdown?
7645175	7646176	Did I finish my email wrong?
7646236	7646896	Okay, fine.
7647688	7650931	A lot of respect goes out to Aki Ripper and his ability to call in so often.
7651071	7654233	I'm still quite impressed that he manages to stay up for so long every week.
7655154	7658056	Anyways, time for something that actually relates to gaming.
7658837	7661759	As we all know, the world is in a state of economic turmoil.
7661900	7671868	Hundreds and thousands of developers are being fired, studios are getting shut down, and the debate of piracy and DRM is getting more attention around the globe as we've heard on the last few shows.
7672588	7676411	But how is this impacting the gaming world on a larger scale?
7676631	7677132	I'll tell you how.
7678740	7679240	DarkSakura.com
7700032	7700792	Thank you for watching!
7720922	7721182	Bioshock 2
7741482	7745866	What made both of those games so amazing was that there was no expectation of what the games would be about.
7746366	7753852	The storytelling in both of these were innovative, the protagonists intriguing, and the setting unique, which really made for a game experience like no other.
7754353	7760017	With this in mind, isn't it sad that there is a Bioshock 2 already out and that Portal 2 is on its way?
7760477	7767143	Have we really reached so low that any new franchise gets 80 or more Metacritic score gets placed on the sequel bandwagon?
7767683	7769066	Is this really what us gamers want?
7769406	7771289	I will have to say I am excited about Hordal 2.
7773092	7801657	I get his point though I get the point but I do want more Portal goodness I think though that some of us are just like we have such awesome experiences with some of these games that we want more of that It's a matter of whether they need to make the sequel or not Some sequels are actually pretty good and some sequels are just kind of we put it out because we want more money I've not been hearing the most friendly feedback regarding Bioshock 2 that a lot of folks are complaining it does feel like a cash cow of the first game Yeah
7802017	7831216	Bioshock was great but there have been some really good original games Little Big Planet I was talking about earlier, Bayonetta Bayonetta was really good or the original Mass Effect I'm saying for sequels though but even original IPs there's been a lot of really good ones in the past year Blur looks like it's going to be great there's some split second to finish the email out I guess I'm just ranting at this point so I will ask another question regarding new IPs when do you think Blizzard will release a game with a new IP?
7832526	7832806	SeaCraft
7850547	7877562	I think once you see the dust settle with Star Trek Starcraft and the World of Warcraft Cataclysm and Diablo 3 is kind of their focus I think you'll start to get some rumblings of what they're doing next and my gut tells me it's going to be an MMO and I'll go so far to say it's an MMO but not like a Warcraft MMO like something kind of different like a Tabula Rasa MMO because you know how Tabula Rasa was like a shooter?
7878682	7880704	I think they're going to go a different route with the MMO.
7880764	7883065	Why make a copy of Warcraft when they have Warcraft?
7883385	7886027	I think they're going to go with an MMO that's different.
7887088	7887708	If that makes sense.
7890490	7894273	Okay, looking forward to the show and your responses, Gditz.
7894313	7894593	P.S.
7894733	7897896	I will most likely be listening live to the next OLR, the one on March 21st.
7897916	7898136	Call us!
7901092	7903174	Yeah, maybe we should have our match game off that week.
7903194	7903474	I don't know.
7903494	7903835	We'll see.
7904155	7905056	Maybe I can plan a match game.
7905096	7906457	Oh, you're not going to be here next week.
7906537	7907438	No, I'll be here.
7907458	7907998	I'll be late.
7908199	7908699	Oh, you'll be late.
7908779	7909059	Okay.
7909180	7910421	I'm going to go to a Seder.
7910801	7911001	Okay.
7911041	7913003	So, well, then what time do you get back from those?
7913023	7913824	About 7, 8?
7914745	7915345	Maybe earlier.
7915505	7915766	All right.
7915826	7916046	Cool.
7916446	7918228	Then we should be able to do a match game in Part B. Yeah.
7919031	7919852	Hello, OLR.
7920192	7921113	Okay, here's the deal.
7921153	7925818	About a month ago, I wrote in about Silent Hill Shattered Memories and DarkSakura, the kind, loving woman she is.
7926098	7926538	Oh, I know.
7927039	7929181	Told me flat out to play one of the originals.
7929822	7931123	Now, I'm getting to my point here.
7931223	7937089	I bought Silent Hill 2 just a couple of days ago, but I could have gotten a Silent Hill 4 The Room.
7937429	7942294	So I was wondering, did I pass up a great game for a load of crap, or are they both equally good, and should I just shut the hell up now?
7943034	7944315	Um, they're different kinds of good.
7944335	7947218	Silent Hill 4 has a very different kind of game.
7947258	7948198	I'm sorry, what was the other game?
7948318	7948919	I heard The Room.
7948939	7952262	It got Silent Hill 2, but passed up Silent Hill 4 to get it.
7953463	7954443	I think you made the good choice.
7954583	7958667	I think, yeah, if you haven't played either, I think you made the better choice with 2.
7958747	7964651	I think 2 is the one that's very iconic of the series, although a lot of folks are partial to 3 and the original as well.
7964952	7969015	I personally am partial to 3, and I still say play 2 first.
7971125	7987097	4 is not bad by any means I think it got raised a little bit by critics too harsh I think it's better than that but I think also it's a little obvious that 4 was intended to be a different game in the beginning but as far as how they're related 3 is more of a sequel to 1
7989427	7992110	and 4 follows some of the story points from 2.
7992731	7994613	Well, 4 was just going to be The Room.
7994913	8001500	That was a new horror franchise they were doing called The Room and they ended up, you know, it's kind of Silent Hill-ish so let's make it Silent Hill.
8002941	8003622	But it worked.
8004323	8005324	It really did work.
8005404	8005684	It did.
8005784	8006565	It was a good game.
8006965	8010049	Horribly underrated by the community at whole.
8010389	8011110	The part with the big head.
8012239	8014282	Oh my god, I screamed like a little girl when I played that.
8014302	8015884	I think Loki was there.
8016044	8024456	I remember falling down and there were these big monster two-headed baby things in the water prison or whatever and I screamed like a girl and Loki said, what the hell are you doing?
8024857	8026459	I'm like, I'm playing Silent Hill and it's scary.
8029834	8033516	Okay, so yeah, they're both equally good, but you did a good thing by buying Silent Hill 2.
8034156	8039859	On another note, my friend brought up a good point today about Max Payne 3, which brings me to another question.
8040460	8045423	Do you guys know whether or not they're going to bring back the comic panels for cutscenes, or are we all fucked for that?
8046023	8047644	Well, I think, I don't know.
8048621	8054243	Yeah, a little early to tell, honestly, but hey, you could always have the digital comics on PSP.
8054383	8054863	You never know.
8055003	8057864	They may make a comic out of it specifically for PSP.
8057884	8059284	It would certainly lend itself well to that.
8060044	8063025	Well, I thank you for reading my email, and if you didn't, why the fuck not?
8064006	8065026	You're a loyal listener.
8065146	8071088	I'll just say, I'm not going to do your whole name, Haseo, from northern Minnesota, the land of the, oh my god, it's so fucking windy.
8071488	8072088	I'm sorry, muddy.
8072308	8072568	Sorry.
8073529	8077550	I like listeners to get a little bit of attitude with us, and if you didn't read this email, why the fuck not?
8077610	8077970	Meow.
8079383	8081164	I like emails that get a little sassy with us.
8082024	8082405	Good job.
8082585	8084846	Oh, we got another, another, another.
8084886	8086247	Did he text us really quick?
8086307	8086567	Yeah.
8086767	8087047	Okay.
8087127	8088328	Okay, one more message.
8088388	8094652	Is there a way to get memory from a PS2, I guess memory card, to a PS1?
8096773	8098994	Because those are a bitch to find without going online.
8101395	8104317	To a PSP and onto a PS3 without the memory card adapter.
8105586	8106967	On to a PS3?
8107107	8108468	No, I think you need the adapter.
8108488	8119275	If you're going from PS1 to PS2, a PS2 will read the cards from one, and you can even put that data on a PS2 card, but only as like a carrier.
8119575	8123397	You can't put a PS2 card in a PS1 under any reason.
8123797	8133043	So the only thing you could do, you could put a PS1 card in a PS2, but unfortunately it ain't going to do you a lick of good without the transmitter cable, unfortunately.
8133243	8133984	That's just the way it is.
8134804	8136305	Oopsies.
8136385	8138306	You might be able to.
8138366	8139206	I don't know if this will work.
8139226	8140527	You might have to do some research on this.
8140887	8147091	You might be able to get something that lets you put your PS1 data on the PC and then you could use a USB stick to do it.
8147591	8150393	That I think is possible, but I can't remember.
8151173	8155435	Yeah, but saves on the PC had different formats and stuff, so it might not work.
8155675	8158337	Because remember, there's like DexDrive formats and stuff.
8158637	8161759	I know this from back in the day when I used to do edit hacking.
8162995	8165036	You might have to spend the money to get the cable, dude.
8165056	8165316	Sorry.
8166136	8166437	All right.
8166757	8168798	Well, let's get into some angst.
8169538	8176961	Sometimes there are things that happen in the world that make us angry, and we always do this segment every week to just get it out of our system so we can be the happy hosts.
8177641	8178202	Yep, here's the leak.
8178342	8178382	Um...
8194321	8196122	You know, I was really trying to think of one.
8197183	8204087	Okay, this is going to require some backstory and it is a little bit of family goings on for me.
8208985	8215348	My brother's girlfriend and her mother were found dead on Monday in Silver Hill, Alabama.
8216829	8229194	So if anyone in the area who knows them don't, you know, say you heard anything... Well, I mean, I just... It's not, I guess, so much of a fuck you type of thing.
8229314	8232096	It's just more of a regrettable thing.
8233716	8234897	I'd actually have to say...
8236423	8245486	Everyone, and Nina, they actually don't know if it, the whole theory is that it's carbon monoxide poisoning what killed them in their, at the mobile home they lived in.
8245946	8249407	Because the last anyone heard anything was Friday.
8250227	8251828	And Matt didn't find out.
8251888	8254049	No one found out until Monday when they found them.
8254749	8261671	But I'm just saying, there's no excuse not to have a carbon monoxide tester, even if that wasn't the cause.
8261831	8262811	It's inconclusive right now.
8263312	8264472	They're treating it as a homicide.
8265152	8273138	But even so, if it was carbon monoxide or some type of gas monitoring or anything, there really shouldn't be any excuse that there's not a way to monitor that.
8273238	8278621	I'd say everyone, your homes and your health and your lives are that important.
8279022	8281183	You should invest a little bit in monitoring.
8281263	8286006	Don't they sell, and if they don't, why not, smoke detectors that double as carbon monoxide detectors?
8286506	8287307	It's a good thing to have.
8287547	8290429	You know how they regulate smoke detectors in public?
8290449	8292790	They should be regulating the multi-detectors, honestly.
8292810	8296372	But in some cases where people smoke in the house, they turn off smoke detectors.
8297973	8299494	I know, I know, I know.
8300195	8308740	And, you know, especially a lot of the manufacturing with some of those mobile homes are not always up to standard.
8309000	8312682	It's always very important that they be checked out, you know.
8313483	8320627	I mean, my brother's girlfriend, she was 18, and her mom was in her 50s.
8321468	8324410	And both way too young to, you know...
8325834	8326875	Well, that's very unfortunate.
8327035	8327975	I'm sorry to hear it.
8328296	8334660	Yeah, and my brother Matthew, he was a bit of a mess when I talked to him, but he seems to be doing better.
8334980	8337202	Well, yeah, I would be too, so I can't blame him.
8338002	8341105	So let that tragedy be awareness for everybody.
8341165	8341945	It's no joke.
8342185	8346368	Just like, you know, unfortunately I had a tragedy where I lost someone to H1N1 last year.
8346748	8347369	It's no joke.
8347429	8348810	Some of these things you hear about, no joke.
8349410	8351492	Alright, Loki, your FU's of the week.
8352552	8354814	We're in need of dick and fart joke to kind of help things out here.
8355534	8356655	Just relieve the tension.
8358716	8361018	Well, this guy was a dick.
8363019	8366461	I don't have anything, no way of working a fart, I guess.
8367082	8369443	I guess you can make a fart sound when you call him, though.
8370144	8370204	Uh...
8372285	8376090	This is the guy last week that stole my Xbox 360 or whatever.
8376190	8381696	And I said, yeah, I'll try to get a hold of him, see if everything works out, blah, blah, blah.
8381816	8384319	Obviously, he wasn't expecting to hear from him and never did.
8384840	8387122	So, you may be able to hear from him instead.
8387563	8390526	So, here's his phone number if you want to give him a call, shoot him a text.
8391287	8392408	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8407137	8426836	Anyways, phone number is area code 209-981-7595 Or you can email him at ixtremejf at gmail.com That's I-X-T-R-E-M-E-J-F at gmail.com What was that number again?
8427256	8431760	That number, once again, was 209-981-7595.
8432221	8437085	It's also in my Twitter if you have questions.
8437685	8439687	I'll be happy to repost it in the chat as well.
8440428	8442530	And feel free to give him a text.
8442970	8443951	Tell him what kind of a douchebag he is.
8443971	8444792	I'm doing that right now.
8446313	8448435	Brad from PodCulture says we should call him on the show.
8448916	8450037	I don't really know.
8450097	8450677	It's not going to happen.
8451758	8452278	It doesn't matter.
8452298	8456822	I don't know how I feel about Loki doing that anyway, but I understand he's pissed, so whatever.
8458142	8458903	Loki speaks for Loki.
8458923	8459343	Whatever.
8459583	8462425	I already contacted the police.
8462525	8463846	I just don't think anything's going to happen.
8464167	8464727	I'm glad you did.
8465848	8468369	I mean, even though they have a phone number, it's hard.
8468470	8469430	It probably got changed.
8470571	8472412	He could very well just get rid of the phone number.
8473593	8475194	The iPhone was probably stolen anyway.
8475574	8476335	Yeah.
8476575	8477095	Honestly.
8477716	8478036	All right.
8478677	8479177	Well, bummer.
8481230	8483752	At the very least, though, I still get JTAG's system.
8483772	8487975	I have one coming off of eBay, legit, and will be here this week.
8488155	8489296	Well, I'm glad your story hasn't happened yet.
8489316	8490016	Yep, invalid number.
8490557	8490757	Yep.
8491738	8492258	Changed the number.
8493855	8494156	All right.
8494516	8495376	And probably change the email, too.
8496457	8496857	Let's see.
8497017	8497837	MyFU.
8497877	8501459	You should look for other similar sounding things in Stockton, though.
8501479	8503780	Like search Craigslist for a similar ad.
8503840	8504261	Okay, good.
8504741	8505001	All right.
8506001	8506522	MyFU.
8506542	8507322	I'll try to keep it brief.
8507682	8510043	I've had to make a very tough decision over the weekend.
8510524	8515086	And so, you know, like with any decision, you have those two guys that sit on your shoulder.
8515126	8521549	Not necessarily the angel and the devil, but the, you know, advocate for one side and the advocate for the other that yell and argue back and forth.
8521929	8530393	So although I'm fairly confident in this decision I'm about to make, I say F you to the guy that sits on my shoulder saying, Are you sure?
8532014	8533075	Are you sure?
8533795	8535836	We could get you a big Uzi to shoot him with.
8536336	8537617	But then I would shoot myself.
8537737	8539138	You know how I feel about guns.
8539178	8541559	You're saying an F you to the granny questions?
8542299	8542840	Shut up.
8543140	8543880	Do you wish to save?
8544140	8545101	Are you sure?
8548150	8549251	Thank you for watching!
8566824	8570907	Activision and Fendi Ward are asking you, do you suffer from mapathy?
8571448	8575511	That's right, they're planning on releasing the first map pack for Modern Warfare 2.
8576412	8579154	It'll be coming to Xbox Live on March 30th.
8579735	8586060	No word yet when PlayStation 3 will be getting it, but apparently it's going to be a timed exclusive type of thing.
8586960	8588741	What will the map pack include?
8589201	8593103	Well, it will include a couple new maps.
8593283	8599687	I guess two of them are Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare 1 remakes.
8601107	8609231	Also, apparently, there's going to be some other ones including Bailout, which is a multi-level apartment complex.
8609552	8610172	That sounds kind of cool.
8611693	8615396	Storm, an open industrial park littered with heavy machinery.
8616016	8621840	Salvage, a snowy junkyard fortified with stacked debris and crushed cars.
8623081	8633849	Two of the maps that are getting remade from Call of Duty 4 include Crash, which is a war-torn urban environment, and Overgrown, which is a massive dry creek bed.
8636351	8636811	Kind of neat.
8640163	8640483	All right.
8641463	8643524	Lots of fun Modern Warfare developments there.
8644624	8648725	Unfortunately, none of those map packs pay the heads of Infinity Ward.
8648745	8653986	I was going to say, was the content designed before the heads of Infinity Ward were axed?
8654026	8654786	I'm assuming they were.
8654806	8655646	No, it's kind of funny.
8655686	8663168	You've got to love, though, the name of the download content is the stimulus package.
8664468	8666749	If that's not a slap in the face, I don't know what is.
8668226	8668726	Oh, did you?
8668746	8671847	And they should have called it Infinity Ward, you know.
8672567	8676449	I didn't realize this because I don't really play games like Modern Warfare.
8676469	8677389	I mean, not that they're bad.
8677429	8678929	They're just games I don't really play.
8679509	8685591	I had heard that the credits in that game are kind of funny because like all the studio credits, you know, they scroll by or whatever.
8685611	8689853	And then when it gets to the credits for Activision, it speeds up and they run by like eight times as fast.
8689913	8691173	And then it goes back to normal.
8691913	8696096	There's always that tongue-in-cheek, we don't like Activision thing going on in those games.
8696737	8698118	I heard that on another show.
8698158	8698858	I thought that was funny.
8699619	8699879	All right.
8700819	8703341	How about some news on Monkey Island?
8703621	8709125	Monkey Island is coming to PSN, Mac, Telltale, and Instant Action, I guess.
8709625	8709986	Let's see.
8711066	8714709	The game store, of course, instantaction.com would be the other thing we're talking about there.
8715349	8716851	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8740404	8744370	Well, there it is, The Secret of Monkey Island 2 coming out this summer on all those systems.
8744731	8748117	So it's not quite the special edition, just so you know.
8748477	8751262	It's just some new controls on the classic game.
8751342	8754186	But still, what a good game.
8756889	8757370	Good times.
8758091	8759793	Alright, I guess that's it for now.
8760594	8762716	Should we try to open up the Skype line and take some calls?
8763097	8766301	Sure, open it wide up.
8766321	8769505	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8769545	8771147	Skype line is open for business.
8772628	8777310	While we wait for some calls, because it takes about a minute for the chatters to get the message, Loki, do you have any last-minute stories for us?
8777510	8778871	I don't know, DarkSakura, do you have anything?
8779131	8779371	Uh-uh.
8780171	8780791	Okay, then Loki?
8782732	8789495	I'm sure I do, and I'm just trying to navigate myself towards the webpage where said stories would be.
8790595	8791476	Let's see here.
8792136	8794557	Let's talk about Guitar Freaks XG.
8794617	8796158	Apparently, it's been released.
8796598	8799339	I'm assuming in Japan, because I sure as hell haven't seen one over here.
8799619	8801560	Then again, I haven't been in Arcaden forever.
8802080	8828608	but um yes Guitar Freak Show Mania XG has been released um in Japan and of course you may remember XG is the one where they have the extra buttons on the guitar and then the drums are a little bit fancier and whatnot but um but is the game fun I don't know well let's go to the phones hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this hi this is Actdeft hi Actdeft what's on your mind our friendly neighborhood Mexican how are you
8829833	8830393	Pretty fine.
8831353	8834635	I just wanted to ask a quick question about the PS3.
8834835	8835055	Yes.
8837075	8838656	Maybe Loki can answer this.
8839396	8845678	I've been hearing and reading in forums that there are PS3 shortages
8848060	8850622	Yeah, there's rumors going around that I've been hearing.
8852143	8857786	It's basically they're trying to sandbag their numbers for the next financial year.
8859026	8862088	Because even right now, God of War 3, there were shortage problems.
8862148	8866030	And there's also rumors that there's a disk pressing problem for God of War 3.
8867351	8869953	Because I know we got shorted pretty bad.
8870833	8872434	As well as everyone else did, apparently.
8872574	8872754	But...
8874355	8880043	It's been anything first party Sony's been hard to get for like the whole year so far.
8880644	8889777	And it's supposed to be a lot better in April when their new financial year starts so that they're basically trying to suck as much sales as they can to next year to make it look better.
8890097	8907429	Let me jump in for a minute here because, yeah, just to support what you're saying, I got a text message when PS3 Mageddon was going on, and it was one of my friends who, I guess, booted up her PS3, and it was right when the issue happened, so nobody knew that there was a time and date issue going on, and she thought the thing was broken.
8907770	8917757	So she went to Best Buy and text messaged me and said, Dude, you might want to know for your show, Best Buy has no PlayStation 3s in stock, and their computer has one in the nation located in a store.
8918317	8919779	I thought it was related to the apocalypse episode.
8935036	8937839	I think that happened on February 28th.
8957600	8958541	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8975226	8975626	Shit!
8977387	8978708	Well, you can always return it, I guess.
8978748	8990435	I guess so, but some stores take a fee for that and stuff, so it's maybe a blessing in disguise that there were hardly any PS3s on shelves to get, so people couldn't have that knee-jerk reaction of, oh, I'll just get a new PS3.
8991396	8991896	Probably.
8992176	8995378	Thank gosh, or else Sony might have been in some bigger doo-doo than they were.
8995638	8998580	But you notice how most people already forgot that that happened.
8998720	8999400	Already passed it.
8999801	9000301	We've moved on.
9002372	9002752	Interesting.
9003353	9007696	Bob Coffee in our chatroom, chat.orange.com, piping in, Walmart hasn't gotten any in a while either.
9008056	9010118	Giovedeo says, my Target's been out for three weeks.
9010278	9012740	So definitely not just a Best Buy thing.
9012780	9014901	It does sound like there is some truth to this rumor.
9014961	9021706	But you watch, if all of a sudden in April they start having tons of them everywhere, that's why, because they were sandbagging them.
9022455	9022995	Final Fantasy XIII
9047855	9049916	and God of War coming out next week.
9049956	9060738	So I don't know why... Oh, you already explained it, but I would expect them to at least put a little more of the consoles out there in the market.
9060958	9068699	Keep in mind though, Actdeft, Sony lost a lot of oomph and people running out to buy a PS3 for Final Fantasy XIII when it jumped ship to 360 as well.
9069080	9075681	And like I've mentioned earlier in the night, I think it was over on Bobby's show, but there really is no reason to run out and buy a PS3
9076241	9079862	If you already have a 360 for Final Fantasy XIII, just get it on the 360.
9079902	9083043	The differences are not major enough to necessitate the change.
9083483	9086764	But God of War 3, now you can't get that anywhere else.
9086864	9088384	So, yeah, I think you make a good point.
9088464	9094606	It seems really strange that Sony would not want God of War 3 to be moving because that's a system seller for some people.
9094666	9095126	It really is.
9096806	9099107	They just figured that they're going to sell those copies.
9099187	9101788	It's just if they don't sell them right now, it's no big deal.
9102668	9102908	But...
9104489	9105389	We'll see, I mean.
9106029	9109311	Well, Actdeft, we've got to let you go so we can get more calls, but do you have any other thoughts for us tonight?
9110911	9111812	No, not really.
9112312	9113713	Just that question right now.
9113953	9115373	All right, well, you have a good one.
9116194	9116734	Take care, buddy.
9118402	9118782	Adios!
9143433	9144154	Are you Googling it?
9144254	9144734	Yes, I am.
9144814	9146736	Okay, well, hold on to that.
9146836	9149078	And if Aki Ripper calls, I don't even know if he's listening.
9149438	9152620	If he calls tonight, I will have you be our unofficial ambassador.
9152740	9153861	I can't read any of this.
9154482	9155523	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9155563	9155923	Who's this?
9157364	9158725	Hi, this is Spazinator.
9158825	9160106	Hey, Spazinator, what's on your mind?
9162468	9163149	Not much.
9163289	9166732	Yeah, I was just going to comment on...
9167799	9179569	What Loki was seeing like five, ten minutes ago, and again last week, about the issue that he's been having with his one system, and that one jerk-off that kind of screwed him over.
9181590	9183552	Yeah?
9184253	9187916	Well, you know, I tried calling the number the other day.
9187936	9191959	You know, at least the other day, the number was working.
9192900	9193060	Okay.
9194325	9201571	Also, if he doesn't mind, I would like to give a little constructive criticism if I may.
9201591	9202812	Wait, hold on, hold on.
9203112	9205414	Loki, are you willing to accept some constructive criticism?
9205434	9206034	Yeah, sure, why not?
9206175	9207235	Alright, then go ahead.
9207796	9218164	Yeah, I know this is going to sound somewhat harsh, but I could have seen this coming a mile away for a couple reasons.
9220714	9226223	Did I put Leslie on Craigslist, which is practically the ghetto of the internet.
9226544	9229949	You know, you hear reports going on.
9230854	9234637	and other news about Craigslist practically every other day.
9255190	9280759	basically because and you know really looking at it now I could probably just done a JTAG install myself but the thing is I wanted to install the Cyclo the Cyclo the Cygnus 2 mod chip in there and that's a lot more difficult to install versus you know the just a JTAG JTAG I mean shit I could I could do that I mean that's it's like seven solder points and that's it and they're big and
9281319	9282721	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9300216	9314148	And really, it wouldn't have been a big deal to go to this thing What I should have done is gone Should have just not left the console Should have just gone with the console Did he try to talk you into it?
9314248	9323517	Like, okay buddy, just come back in a couple hours and I'll have your console all done Well, it wasn't even that, it was like 30 minutes I was gonna go eat Whose idea was it to leave?
9323957	9324197	His.
9325898	9332681	But, you know, I could see that word that would be something, you know, where... Yeah, when you're in the... I mean... Yeah, I understand.
9332701	9334022	Hindsight is 20-20.
9334262	9337363	But when you're in the moment and you're like, okay, I kind of trust this guy.
9337403	9338184	He's got his phone.
9338204	9338624	He seems cool.
9338644	9340845	I bought stuff from Craigslist before and it's been fine.
9340885	9344707	Yeah, and to be fair, although I'm joking about it being, you know, the bowels of the internet, I...
9345988	9349311	I've seen job postings and stuff work on Craigslist.
9349471	9354156	My company's posted availabilities on Craigslist, so there are useful purposes for it.
9354217	9361124	I think if as far as it goes with services and stuff like that, you just have to be careful.
9361144	9362826	Especially with adult services.
9363306	9371891	For the love of God, if you're going to seek adult services on Craigslist, you not only need to use three methods of protection all at once.
9372091	9376554	And that's assuming that it is actually somebody and not just a police sting operation.
9376574	9378856	Yeah, and then you're going to want to bathe in bleach, honestly.
9379756	9383579	But seriously, it's just some stupid things.
9383659	9395749	And what you need to do, obviously, if you're getting some services done online, where you're going to get something taken from... A legitimate person would give you some sort of receipt.
9395789	9397630	You would have an address.
9397650	9400893	You wouldn't go to an address and he'd be waiting outside of...
9402294	9403554	There's a lot of red flags.
9403575	9407698	For example, the address that he gave me was an apartment complex.
9408738	9409999	It's not a house.
9410199	9411020	I thought it was a house.
9411480	9413041	I was like, okay, I got his address.
9413242	9414322	Where's he going to go?
9414342	9414743	It's a house.
9415943	9417164	But no, it was an apartment complex.
9417425	9420407	Where his friend probably lived.
9421127	9422288	He has this down to his science.
9422348	9423649	He ripped you off, he'll rip someone else off.
9423929	9425430	My question is, what's he doing with all these 360s?
9427311	9427791	I don't know.
9427951	9428852	Probably selling them.
9428892	9429892	Drugs, who knows.
9430212	9431032	Spazinator, I'm sorry.
9431072	9432192	Go ahead.
9432533	9434293	Yeah, I was about to say the same thing.
9435033	9449357	For at least 10 to 15 years now, throughout the country, not just my area or even just your area, consoles, especially when they're still at the $250 to $300 range, are really, really big with thieves.
9454676	9461647	They take those $250 to $300 Dell consoles, deal them, turn around a fellow for $50 to $100, or just trade them straight out for...
9468976	9472178	Drugs, whatever their drug of choice happens to be.
9472278	9473818	And you never know.
9474058	9488986	It's a bummer with, since Xbox has the ability to lock out your console when you do something naughty on Xbox Live, it's kind of a pity they don't have a type of service where you could call in and find out where your 360 is or who's connecting to the internet.
9489286	9494348	I mean, granted, they don't want to help people like Loki, but some people get their 360s legitimately stolen out of their home.
9494368	9497550	Like, I remember Spazinator, weren't you the guy that had your PS3 taken right out of your house?
9499670	9521747	Yeah, and oddly enough, back in 2003, literally just as the calendar switched over from July to August, two guys barged into my apartment building and had stolen my PlayStation 2.
9523949	9528773	I called the police immediately, but unfortunately
9529725	9533486	It's hard to track, too, because there's not, like, unique license plates or whatever.
9533506	9534206	But there is.
9534266	9535207	There's a serial number.
9535747	9537447	I have the serial number.
9537867	9539588	It's a bummer you can't track?
9552291	9554413	It's a bummer Xbox doesn't have a service.
9554453	9559417	Punch in serial number and something to verify it to tells you where it's at.
9559458	9565163	The guy knew what he was doing as far as JTAGing stuff because he knew what he was talking about.
9565463	9570427	He probably not only runs the service, he probably mods your stolen 360 and then sells it.
9570567	9573970	Well, here's the thing, and I don't really have a problem that the 360 was stolen.
9574070	9576973	I have a problem that I waited four hours in Stockton.
9577293	9579975	Don't waste my time if you're going to steal from me.
9579995	9581956	You should have at least had the decency to just mug me.
9582276	9592523	No, seriously, if he was going to steal my system, just don't respond back to any of my phone calls at all instead of dragging it on for four fucking hours because that was really the issue.
9592723	9594124	I have 360 consoles.
9594284	9596585	I don't really give a crap if one of them goes away.
9597246	9602369	It's just an inconvenience for me to sit there for four fucking hours in a car waiting for somebody.
9602789	9622172	I gotta wrap up here and let Spaznate get his final thoughts because we gotta get some more calls but I do want to read this comment from chat because it's funny Brad from PodCulture says this is why my apartment is protected by the sword of omens no shit I have a replica here in the studio that's a weenie we need a sword in the OLR studio okay maybe not DarkSakura might have a gun but she knows not to tell me seriously I have knives
9622913	9625855	I've had all my airsoft guns stolen.
9625875	9627515	That was worth way more than this stupid 360.
9628476	9629937	I just let it roll right off me.
9630877	9632718	It's a 360, whatever.
9632878	9634039	I'd be screaming.
9634259	9635580	I've got four more there broken.
9635700	9637721	I've got to let Spazinator wrap up because we've got to get more calls.
9637761	9640382	Spazinator, thank you for the lively discussion and inspiration.
9640402	9642383	Do you have any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?
9644404	9645425	Nothing comes to mind.
9645745	9648426	I'll take five seconds or less.
9649547	9650908	I'll talk to Loki...
9651804	9658588	about this issue later on throughout the weekend on live or on Twitter or whatever.
9659329	9661050	I'll talk to you guys later.
9661090	9661730	Just be careful.
9661770	9663891	He might mess with you like he was messing with Cheeseburger.
9663971	9665252	Oh, that was just earlier.
9665612	9667494	I can't believe he got so confused by it.
9667554	9669995	I was just like, he must have been confused with the other Loki.
9670055	9671096	You're so rude, Loki.
9671116	9671376	All right.
9671676	9672517	Take care, Spazinator.
9672537	9673097	Thanks for the call.
9673297	9673717	Have a good one.
9674398	9674518	Yep.
9675034	9695427	I gotta ask Spazinator if he's watching the tester because he's a big Sony fan I mean usually he'll call in although I don't know about anymore because I know he's been having his issue with Sony's lately but I gotta ask him if he's been watching that because it seems like as a Sony fan maybe that's something he's into I don't know I can't believe I'm admitting I've actually been watching the tester
9696207	9697128	It's not terrible.
9698670	9701894	I'm going to file it under the Tron and Showgirls category.
9702095	9704618	It's so bad it's kind of good.
9704678	9705459	I can't explain it.
9705859	9711386	And seriously, the whole reason I put the guy's phone number in email, because I know that the police aren't going to do anything.
9711406	9713830	They're not going to be able to do anything because they don't have a name.
9713870	9714991	This is martial law.
9714991	9716592	Amiga 777, what is on your mind my friend?
9740734	9748042	Hi, I'd just like to send a public apology to some of the listeners from Japan that might have been listening last week.
9748762	9755269	I guess about some of the things that I said about, you know, the whole PlayStation 2 birthday tenure thing.
9755570	9755790	Yeah?
9758419	9762082	Um, actually, you know, PS2 is alright.
9765304	9771348	There are a lot of things, you know, kind of going back to that question, you're like, what could the Dreamcast have done better?
9772648	9773129	And, uh...
9774147	9788273	So going back on that, well, I could probably enter that question maybe toward in, let's see, October, which is technically the month that the PS2 came out here in the U.S.,
9793668	9799233	You know what, Amiga, I remember your call and I don't think you have to go out of your way to apologize.
9799293	9800935	It was your own opinion and what have you.
9801515	9803076	And last week was a little bit crazy anyway.
9803537	9815107	But, you know, I think you kind of bring up a point though that certainly the PlayStation 2 saw levels of success in other countries that may not have even been, you know, kind of duplicated here or what have you.
9815939	9817120	Oh, okay.
9818160	9821082	That was just one thing that was on my mind.
9821402	9823283	All right, well, you know what?
9823603	9827646	It takes a real man to man up to an apology, although I don't think you needed to apologize.
9827686	9829767	You had a perfectly fine opinion, but that's fine.
9829907	9831328	You said your piece.
9831608	9834149	But I think, can't we all just get along?
9834310	9838632	There's room in retro gaming love for PS2 and Dreamcast, and plenty of it.
9840838	9841619	Take care, Amiga.
9841639	9842120	Have a good one.
9842661	9843061	Take care.
9843222	9845224	Later.
9845244	9848509	877-GAME-OLR is the number to call, but our phones are lighting up.
9848529	9849471	There's like back-to-back calls.
9849491	9850412	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9850432	9850792	Who's this?
9851373	9852795	Hey, this is Brad from PodCulture.
9852815	9854538	Well, hello, Brad from PodCulture.
9854558	9855119	What's on your mind?
9856492	9860076	Oh, Loki, you are far more laid back than I ever would be.
9860096	9860576	I know.
9861036	9864480	Just based on your Twitter and some of the problems, I won't get into it because it's on your Twitter.
9864780	9873588	Some of the recent problems you've been having with a certain realty company you've been dealing with, you do not strike me as the type that would be as passive as Loki.
9874248	9874909	I'm red-headed.
9874949	9876251	I got the temperament to go with it.
9876331	9877072	That's all right.
9877192	9877812	That's all right.
9878033	9880996	Well, there's just not much I can do with the information I have and stuff.
9881036	9884279	It's not like I can go to the guy's house and demand justice.
9884620	9885501	Give me back my son!
9885541	9890026	I don't know where the hell he lives, and I don't know what the hell his name is, because he's used a couple different names.
9890126	9892168	At this point...
9893209	9894030	Lesson learned.
9894290	9896513	You just get smarter, that's all you have to do.
9896553	9898254	You have to use this as an opportunity.
9898415	9906523	Not that we should be encouraging people to mod their consoles anyway, but you had a legitimate, I mean, I think it's legitimate to want to mod your 360 to play Japanese games.
9907003	9913170	Every week on this show I talk about Japanese release dates, and even just tonight I said, oh, here's a game on the 360, looks interesting, it'll never come out over here.
9913730	9917331	So people have a legitimate reason to want to mod their 360 to play Japanese games.
9917651	9921352	But let Loki's pain be a lesson to the rest of you.
9921832	9923053	Be careful.
9923273	9924133	It's time to be smart.
9924233	9925653	Use common sense.
9926013	9931415	Don't trust a dude you met on Craigslist with your console ever.
9931435	9932315	Do not walk away.
9932375	9933316	Don't get talked into it.
9933596	9935316	Just say, no, I'll just hang out here.
9935896	9937537	Can I watch you do it or whatever?
9937597	9938497	I'll just kind of...
9939277	9941479	You know, sit here and watch you from my car.
9941639	9943000	Be just upfront and honest.
9943020	9945041	Be like, listen, dude, I just met you.
9945121	9946122	I don't fucking trust you.
9946242	9948243	So, you know, I'm going with the console.
9948584	9950665	You know, you're either going to do this real quick.
9951025	9957910	And the other thing, too, I mean, it's like, seriously, if it's going to take four hours, I want to be there fucking going, hey, listen, are you done?
9958110	9958510	Are you done?
9958690	9959050	Are you done?
9959211	9959631	Are you done?
9959931	9963393	You know, or like, you know, if it's taking too damn long, listen, I'll just finish the rest at home.
9963894	9964414	You know, because that...
9966094	9980914	it's just it's absolutely ridiculous to have to wait for four hours and it's just that was the part that pissed me off is the fact that he drug it out for four fucking hours if you're gonna steal a thing just say you just don't reply back or just reply back to the text you know sucker and then that's it
9982136	9983397	He's like, seriously, what are you going to do?
9983457	9985338	It's like, you know, I can't track you down.
9985358	9986459	I don't know where the fuck you live.
9986559	9990622	So, you know, I wish I did follow him because then I'd know where the fuck he lived.
9990962	9992744	I'd be going right straight to his apartment.
9993604	9995365	Or probably just wouldn't have gotten anything to eat.
9996006	9998207	Or one of the listeners would have gone straight to his apartment by now.
9998988	9999428	Probably.
9999849	10000369	There you go.
10000949	10005773	Well, do you have any further advice, I guess, maybe, for Loki?
10006033	10006874	Don't use Craigslist?
10006954	10007254	I don't know.
10008895	10010156	Well, you know, trust no one.
10012142	10013203	Pretty much.
10013283	10018566	Or if you're going to go use someone on Craigslist or whatever like that, just be really crazy about it.
10019307	10020528	Fingerprint the guy.
10021889	10023610	Get his picture.
10023790	10027072	Or if he takes your 360, take their driver's license or something.
10027152	10028773	Although that could be fake too.
10028813	10031014	Well, most people I don't think would expect that.
10031475	10031955	That's true.
10033116	10039580	The one time I had a console chipped, it was somebody who knew somebody and that was back in the day when the PlayStation 1
10041378	10041859	Oh, man.
10041879	10044082	The PlayStation 1 was so easy to mod, though.
10044863	10047327	DarkSakura bought me a plug.
10047427	10051473	It's like a present for, I don't know, something that I just plugged into the back of the thing.
10051573	10051833	You did.
10051874	10052675	I don't even know if you remember.
10052695	10053876	I got mine chipped just to play two games.
10053896	10053937	Oh.
10058823	10073053	you did, that's how we played, remember the one day at my apartment we all came, all the sacramentals came over to play DDR Third Mix that's when I discovered my love for Erotic and Oh Nick Please Not So Quick yeah, the thing, the IOPort thing yeah
10074034	10080156	I don't have the skills to solder, so I had to have someone do it.
10080176	10082037	I also have another art form I'm looking to get rid of.
10083117	10091400	We used those for a while, but for the longest time Dan and I didn't need them because we could still disc swap on our PlayStation.
10092641	10093401	The single swap.
10094580	10096580	Oh yeah, there was like a trick you could do for it.
10096821	10099461	Well, with the first one, it was just the single swap.
10099501	10106082	It would load the PlayStation screen, and then you stop the spinner by pressing the little button to the thing.
10106102	10106603	Yeah, I remember that.
10106703	10108023	Yeah, and then you move it out.
10108263	10109723	You used a paper clip to do it.
10109883	10111084	Crazy, crazy stuff.
10111104	10114944	All right, well, Brad, anything else on your mind tonight you wanted to talk about?
10115464	10122386	Well, with the, you know, games are expensive and stuff, and I've got the studio in turmoil here because we're packing up to move.
10124437	10134007	But to save a few bucks and something that not everyone might think about is I've been buying a lot of games used from Gamefly.
10134047	10137091	I just picked up Brutal Legend, Batman Arkham Asylum, and...
10138325	10142249	Ghostbusters for less than the price of one game new.
10142629	10144250	I've actually been using Gamefly now.
10145031	10147633	I have this really bad habit of hanging on to one game for six months.
10148694	10154500	They send me emails all the time about, hey, do you just want to buy the game you've had for four months?
10154900	10155921	It's not a bad idea.
10155941	10158063	I think they give you a little bit of money.
10158143	10158523	It's like $5, $10.
10159664	10161966	It's not very significant, but it's enough to try and hook you.
10162307	10163227	The little fish bait.
10163327	10164789	Enough to try and hook you.
10165409	10168952	They're at the top of their game for the service they're providing.
10168992	10172594	It's not a service for everybody, but it's a good service.
10173655	10174696	I don't use it that often.
10174776	10176917	Just like, I'm kind of broke right now.
10177017	10179199	But yeah, used games, nothing wrong with that.
10179259	10186944	There's so many games that came out like a year ago that I didn't have time to play that there's... Less than 20 bucks a pop now.
10187044	10188065	For real, for real.
10188606	10193329	So good advice to the gamer in this economy, I suppose.
10193709	10193929	All right.
10193969	10197754	Well, Brad, we got to let you go because our phone lines have been on fire and I want to get at least one more call.
10197774	10198274	Later, guys.
10198434	10198815	Later, buddy.
10199656	10199896	All right.
10200337	10203841	Again, please don't be butthurt if you don't get through our phone call.
10204762	10208085	Of course, now it's not lit up, but probably because everyone still hears Brad on the phone.
10208786	10214968	I wanted to tell you, Rob, I actually went on to the iTunes store because, really, I wanted to buy Final Fantasy II.
10216929	10218970	And I found reviews for Street Fighter IV.
10219230	10221231	Oh, yes, that had come out during GDC, I heard.
10221271	10227573	Yeah, I'm probably going to pick it up after payday, just given that out of 567 reviews, it's currently sitting at...
10233795	10234175	Let me see.
10234255	10239398	Okay, out of 894 ratings, it's got 668 five-star.
10240118	10242139	So it's currently at a four-and-a-half star.
10242439	10242979	That's not bad.
10244140	10244440	Yeah.
10244640	10246721	I couldn't believe, though, the controls are any good.
10246741	10249122	But we got another call, so I'm going to go to the phones.
10249642	10250563	Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio.
10250603	10250943	Who's this?
10250963	10252924	It's DT.
10253244	10255305	Hey, I haven't heard from you in a long time.
10255345	10256166	How are you, DT?
10256506	10256966	I know.
10257466	10257746	Good.
10258166	10258607	Good, good.
10258627	10259987	I took out that shirt, by the way.
10260908	10261288	What's that?
10264409	10272373	Oh my god, that's like finding your class of 96 shirt in a truck somewhere.
10273114	10273854	That's awesome.
10273894	10276075	Yes, the first tournament was SCAT, right?
10276095	10278037	Shaft was second, right?
10278057	10280538	Sacramento's cosplay and tournament.
10280898	10287002	For those that don't know, okay, again, let me quickly give the backstory for those that haven't listened to OLR a very long time.
10288742	10296504	This show was formed because Loki, myself, and DarkSakura, and DT, you were a part of this circle too, would meet up at the arcade and play DDR games.
10296704	10298044	And that's how we all kind of met.
10298144	10301065	And of course, our show started about music-based video games because of that.
10301405	10307226	But when the Mamani series started kind of tapering off, we branched out to saying, well, hell, we play all video games.
10307246	10308106	We don't just play DDR.
10308126	10309126	Let's talk about all video games.
10309166	10310767	So that's where we've been at for a few years.
10312867	10319012	But as part of this DDR loving circle, we used to throw tournaments.
10319312	10325197	And the first one we had was SCAT, Sacramentals, because we're from Sacramento, California, cosplay and tournament.
10325657	10330261	And we actually encouraged people to dress up, although I think we had maybe four people all day that actually came dressed up.
10330681	10338088	And then we had a DDR tournament, which actually, for its time, a lot of people... We had a ton of people show up!
10338208	10341691	Sacramento was kind of the place you went because you just don't give a fuck.
10341731	10345895	I think a lot of people didn't take our tournament that seriously, and it was okay.
10346075	10347076	People had fun with it.
10347156	10349158	And you know me, you know DarkSakura, you know Loki.
10349398	10350540	We're all about just having fun.
10350860	10353082	I think Loki, if I remember right... Oh, Loki.
10353102	10353883	I'm going to embarrass Loki.
10354543	10357005	Loki had a Dynamite Rave routine ready to go.
10357265	10358586	Not really.
10358606	10361568	I had at one point memorized Dynamite Rave backwards.
10361708	10366231	And he was dressed up like one of the guys from The Matrix because it was that many years ago.
10366251	10367712	Just because I had a trench coat on.
10368232	10369093	Well, that's what you look like.
10369353	10371194	And he started to dance and he fell.
10371835	10375097	And I forgot what the... But he laughed.
10375137	10376598	He didn't go in the corner and cry.
10377098	10379560	He laughed and we all laughed at him.
10379860	10381061	No, we all laughed with him.
10381681	10381941	All right.
10382742	10383422	And then we laughed at him.
10383502	10384003	No, I'm just kidding.
10384783	10385444	Well, oh, yeah, no, I The best of
10411775	10416059	The Best of Orange Lounge Radio Well, I'm just waiting on Misty to finish up the narration Yeah, I...
10429799	10433302	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10458599	10459579	That'll be a fun show.
10459659	10463260	Tune in for that night when I'm not here and DarkSakura is running the control board.
10463340	10464740	That's going to be a hootin' holla.
10464820	10464900	Hi!
10465080	10468101	You're going to have to totally show me the stuff that I'm missing, by the way.
10468281	10468861	Can't wait.
10469602	10470042	It's easy.
10471242	10473442	This new system is so much easier than our old system.
10473742	10474103	It's easy.
10475083	10475763	So, it'll be fun.
10476383	10477923	Anything else on your mind, DarkSakura, tonight?
10479364	10483125	No, I've just been playing a lot of 2DX.
10483205	10483485	Oh, 2DX.
10483565	10484905	You beat a new song tonight, right?
10486107	10493350	Yeah, I actually passed V. Well, I got this, I don't know if Loki's heard of it, the ESR, the memory card exploit.
10493830	10494251	Oh, okay.
10495371	10497092	You can play copies on it.
10498672	10499113	Very cool.
10499613	10501734	Yeah, I beat V, finally.
10502014	10502954	Congratulations.
10502974	10505075	That's quite an accomplishment, so very cool.
10505395	10507496	All right, well, DT, I'm going to let you go.
10507756	10509877	Have a good one, buddy, and thanks for calling.
10509917	10510117	You too.
10510357	10511178	All right, bye-bye.
10512940	10518324	SSJ100Matt actually has a really good suggestion in chat saying we should try to do a pre-recorded PAX show.
10518984	10526269	Actually, what I think would be really funny is that maybe there won't be a live show next week, but maybe there'll be some type of recorded show.
10527230	10535215	I know I'm going to PAX with my buddy Seg, who is part of the Umlaut crew, and my friend Amanda, who's really funny.
10535335	10537777	She's never been on the show because I think she works a lot Sunday nights.
10538357	10540459	You've met Amanda, of course, Jamie, right?
10540719	10541179	Little Amanda?
10541199	10541399	Yes.
10541459	10542220	It's going to PAX.
10542620	10543381	How random is that?
10543401	10544482	I want to go.
10545022	10545583	So we're all going.
10545643	10546343	I think it might be fun.
10546383	10549386	We might do like a recorded thing, and then I know OLR fans are going to be there.
10549867	10556973	So I will tell you next week if I'm going to have a hat or a shirt or something to look for me, and I need to look at the schedule.
10557033	10558574	Maybe I can finish your scarf.
10559335	10559955	You should.
10560196	10561056	Look for the rainbow scarf.
10561477	10563258	Oh, too bad you can't make me an orange scarf.
10563819	10564740	I can make you an orange scarf.
10564980	10566541	Can you whip one up in like a week and a half?
10567822	10568143	This is me.
10568163	10569124	Do you want me to make you a hat?
10570518	10572319	Can you make one that says OLR on it?
10572920	10573780	Might be a little tough.
10573860	10574381	Might be a little tough.
10574421	10574961	I'm not that good yet.
10575001	10577703	Why don't I make you just a big obnoxious orange scarf?
10577923	10579304	Okay, a big obnoxious orange scarf.
10579324	10579525	Excellent.
10579545	10580745	And I'll even put fuzzy fringe on it.
10580906	10581266	Excellent.
10581306	10582587	Make it fuzzy and very gay.
10582947	10583187	Okay.
10583267	10583507	Okay.
10583948	10584228	Excellent.
10584248	10585549	So then that means the rainbow one might have...
10585589	10586369	I have to wait a little bit.
10586469	10587950	It's for a good cause.
10588030	10590410	By the way, the Skype line is going to be closed.
10590470	10590930	I'm sorry.
10591070	10592431	Don't be butthurt if you didn't get through.
10592451	10593051	I'm very sorry.
10593111	10593831	Send us an email.
10593851	10595151	Mailbag at orangelaundry.com.
10595211	10597452	Quick, write it down now, what you were wanting to call in about.
10598892	10600753	Yeah, big, flamey orange scarf.
10601033	10603813	And I will find a game room.
10603853	10605374	Like, you know, they do the game rooms at PAX.
10605414	10606834	I'm going to look at what games are going on.
10606854	10614296	And especially if there's, like, a music-based one, I will make it a point to be there for, like, DDR hour or, you know...
10615056	10616776	as a throwback to how this show started.
10616876	10619277	I will make it a point to be there doing a music game thing.
10619657	10623198	And I know there's quite a few OLR listeners going, so I hope to see you guys.
10623818	10625198	Yeah, and I like what Actdeft is saying.
10625218	10628259	Make a pre-recorded, pre-packed show and a best of the same week.
10628819	10638101	It'll be a little weird because, you know, it's not OLR without Loki and Dark Sakura, so I would say it's a spin-off show for the week that might go to the feed.
10638421	10641782	It would actually be a show called Rob Goes to Packs or something like that.
10642322	10644123	and then I don't know what DarkSakura and Loki will do.
10644183	10644723	It'll be funny.
10645043	10647845	I think you guys should just do something fucking random like next week.
10647905	10650606	Just get together and play a game or something and tape it.
10650646	10651246	It'll be funny.
10652467	10653968	Anyway, we'll talk about that over the next couple weeks.
10654008	10660531	If you have ideas, email mailbagorangeonestradio.com SSJ100Matt says I should be using the Twitter when I'm at PAX so they can stalk me.
10661051	10663332	Abso-fucking-lutely I'm going to be on the Twitter.
10663653	10666934	Prepare to have your Twitters flooded with tweets from PAX.
10667014	10668875	I will be doing that on the oil.
10668955	10669776	I'll be tasteful.
10669796	10670116	Don't worry.
10670156	10670776	Is Sony supposed
10670776	10671536	Pax Prime Pax Prime
10699122	10699962	That was still fun, though.
10700603	10701163	So, we'll see.
10701483	10702123	Yeah, it was fun.
10702163	10702703	It was very fun.
10703363	10703664	All right.
10705944	10709125	Some folks in chat really like the idea of DarkSakura and Loki doing a show without me.
10709165	10709686	Well, fine.
10709726	10710506	I see how you are.
10711586	10714847	SSJ100Matt says, have Dan here and have him take Skype calls the whole show.
10715808	10716328	This will be Dan.
10716608	10716928	Ring.
10717628	10718529	Talk to Orange Islands Radio.
10718729	10718929	Hi.
10719189	10719709	I don't care.
10719809	10720209	Bye.
10721510	10722590	Shut the fuck up, junkie.
10723286	10723967	Dan, Dan, Dan
10748018	10748659	Should I say that?
10748800	10749161	I don't know.
10749201	10750283	Maybe too early?
10750383	10750804	Too soon?
10751666	10753069	No, that's not too soon.
10753350	10758100	We're thinking about doing something.
10760649	10783569	Vault related and I will say this much currently it is just an OLR project it has nothing to do with all games if we can work it in with all games excellent but there's so many great shows on all games that we're planning to do it just to say show that's not live so we'll see more to come and that might not be the only new show coming soon we'll see alright anyhow
10786129	10787090	Um, alright.
10788411	10790473	So, chatters like the idea of a Dan show.
10790493	10792454	You better see if Dan's going to be available PAX weekend.
10793174	10794215	Tell them the chatters demand it.
10794615	10795896	Alright, we're going to wrap shit up.
10795936	10796917	It's time for us to get out of here.
10797017	10798198	First, though, last minute stories.
10798238	10799479	I don't know if Loki cleared them out.
10799519	10801721	So, any other last minute stories you guys have?
10801821	10802461	Kitty!
10802681	10804623	Kitty YouTubes don't count as last minute stories.
10805063	10805543	No, I...
10806764	10808705	It's Maru the Cat.
10832078	10836799	Let's see, there's apparently a new guitar game, or I guess a new guitar that's out there.
10837640	10839360	This is called the Power Gig Guitar.
10839760	10842961	It is not only a guitar controller, but it's a real guitar.
10843761	10845822	And you can apparently use it with rock band and whatnot.
10846322	10848902	And you can also plug it into an amp and actually play a real guitar.
10850643	10852523	No word on what the cost is on it, though.
10852543	10853223	Let me see here.
10854544	10857804	I haven't said what the cost is on it yet, but it looks neat.
10858705	10859845	I guess, if you want a guitar...
10861447	10864030	Although I'd probably just buy a separate guitar if that's just me.
10867563	10868223	Portal 2 is at E3.
10868243	10868584	Duh, duh, and duh.
10897148	10897708	Exactly.
10898929	10901850	Also, Battlestar Galactica is apparently getting an MMO.
10902470	10903430	Frackin' awesome!
10904030	10905771	And it's interesting, though.
10905811	10914474	It says that it's being developed for SyFy, I guess, by Big Point, which they've done several titles in the genre, I guess, before.
10915374	10922537	And I guess it'll be coming out this autumn on SyFy's website for an exclusive 30-day period.
10922937	10924458	And I don't know where it's going from there.
10926098	10935584	I gotta say, since we've now finally done what we told the listeners we were going to do for years and we did our fuck show last week, we might have to do a frack show the week Battlestar Galactica comes out.
10936965	10938225	I'm just kidding.
10938285	10938846	I'm kidding.
10939886	10941527	We need a new epic show idea.
10941647	10943028	I'm sure one will come up soon enough.
10947129	10960987	there's still the wheel of obscenity that I've wheel of obscenity, turn, turn, turn show us the curse word that we should learn exactly yeah, and that's pretty much it for now
10961556	10963698	Alright, that's it.
10963738	10966439	We're going to wrap it up and get on out of here for the night.
10966479	10967380	It's a good show though.
10967440	10968181	It was fun.
10968221	10969742	Lots of ground covered tonight.
10969802	10980009	Considering, you know, this was the week that Final Fantasy XIII came out, we did a very good job of talking about a lot of games and not just that one tonight because we talked about it all last week amongst the F-words.
10980629	10981891	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10999910	11020994	you know about this show help us spread the word and if you're like Rob I've told everybody I can't think of anyone else to tell then please post a review somewhere iTunes the Zoom listing Podcast Alley wherever there's plenty of podcasting sites help us spread the word and there's even some folks have gone so far to do forum signatures and stuff that is like way more than we could ask for and really appreciate it just so you know so thank you very much
11021715	11023276	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
11023757	11024738	I'll start with my final thought.
11024778	11026680	My final thought is I want a taco.
11026800	11028402	Again, yes, it's a Sunday night tradition.
11028422	11029103	Taco, taco, taco.
11029683	11030645	DarkSakura, your final thought.
11031125	11032106	I love my kitty.
11033328	11034709	Yes, there's Shermie YouTubes now, huh?
11034829	11041617	Yeah, Shermie has two YouTubes up, but I also was watching Maru the Cat, and that's cute, too.
11042717	11043759	Loki, your final thought tonight.
11044280	11050450	Two more weeks, I get to play the Rockstar staff in Grand Theft Auto 4, and I intend on kicking the crap out of them.
11050631	11051853	Are you going to film it somehow?
11053220	11054720	You gotta make that happen.
11054760	11055260	Make it happen.
11055280	11056541	I could do that, I guess.
11056661	11057201	Make it work.
11057601	11058641	That would be sweet.
11058821	11059081	There you go.
11059101	11078886	But the problem is, because they're doing an event, because they do these every now and then, and I always miss them, but it's actually during my work time that it happens to take place, and it's teams of two that you get to go play against them, but I'm just gonna kick the crap out of them, and it's gonna be hilarious.
11079206	11079686	Can't wait.
11080046	11080346	Can't wait.
11080734	11083938	Alright, well thank you guys very much and tune in next week.
11084018	11086181	We'll be back next week with more Orange Lounge Radio.
11086221	11088423	Jamie may be a little late, but that's not going to stop the show.
11088924	11091807	So we'll be back next week with more Orange Lounge Radio.
11091827	11092208	Yes, Jamie?
11092388	11093129	You'll be here just late.
11093529	11093730	We.
