182840	186760	off just as we have the past several years talking about how is your gaming
186760	189760	week and dark soccer what kind of video games you've been playing this week
189760	198760	Atari yeah I played Gorf and I played tempest 3000 I played tempest 2000 I
198760	205000	played I'll just go ahead and say it I played Space Harrier on the Atari XL
205000	209880	hmm a beta interesting is like a new thing or like a prototype that never
209880	214160	happened it's a new thing it's developed development right now I met the guy did
214160	220240	the soundtrack oh very cool cool um I played what else did I play I played
220240	226080	centipede on the Atari XL with a remapped trackball
226080	230840	play a little peggle play a lot of actually not really a whole lot of
230840	241720	Star Trek online I did like a battle and yeah all right well we'll come back to
241720	247400	talk a little later about all the Atari stuff Dan actually got um Gradius the
247400	255360	Gradius thing for we the Gradius rebirth yeah the redone Gradius yeah and so it
255360	260560	was fun watching him cuss at the Moai heads I didn't but you know I bought
260560	263240	that but I didn't really play enough of it I got distracted with something else
263240	273080	using of course of course Loki how was your gaming week well not too eventful
273080	284360	I played Final Fantasy 13 and I'm made like six hours into it and played more
284360	291080	Grand Theft Auto and actually part of the week our internet was down at work
291080	297520	or our network in the room that we have the 360s in so we ended up playing some
297520	302880	old-school Saints Row one a death or death match multiplayer so that's fun
302880	308000	because you could do a system link on those and they don't require Xbox Live
308000	314720	and then I did check out the demo for just cause two it's pretty fun not as
314720	322600	fun as I would hoped but I think I'd like it kind of got that mercenaries to
322600	326320	vibe to it I mean it's very similar obviously to the first just cause game
326320	334280	but thankfully it is well very much higher production value than mercenaries
334280	342680	to in that game was glitched out every which way possible so I did finish
342680	348040	downloading the blur multiplayer beta haven't played it yet so that'll be
348040	352800	pretty fun they're supposed to be adding some more codes for that so hopefully
352800	353880	I'll be able to give you one
353880	358320	Rob so I got one I just I'm in the same boat you are I had so much other stuff
358320	362760	going on and I was really excited about blur too but I keep now I'll get into it
362760	363760	a minute
363760	370160	so yeah I think that's really all I played this week I tried going back to
370160	375280	play some more Borderlands but since I've been modding the hell out of it I
375280	378560	finally downloaded the patch that's supposed to get rid of all that stuff
378560	385040	and it kind of jacked up my game like now it won't load my save game correctly
385040	390000	and it's not a big deal because I don't really care about the progress in the
390000	395040	game or my level or whatever cuz I've been cheating anyways it's just that I
395040	398320	don't have to go do all those quests again because it's a lot of just running
398320	406000	around it's really annoying so I have to go through and get to be fixed again and
406000	407440	then I'll cheat again
407440	411560	oh by the way I am also cheating through Final Fantasy 13 because you can you
411560	416320	know edit the save games to do all sorts of crazy stuff if you can cheat it or
416320	418520	hack it or crack it Loki's probably done it
418520	422200	by the way speaking of hacking and cheating I think Dan wants to talk to
422200	425320	you about something related to a Japanese Xbox game
425320	431960	okay awesome anyhow if that's it for Loki's gaming week then I'll go ahead
431960	436320	my gaming week yeah like Loki said I I got into the blur beta but sadly I've
436320	441400	just been so into Final Fantasy 13 that like all of my gaming time has been
441400	446440	sucked into Final Fantasy 13 I'm about 16 hours in at this point and I get the
446440	450720	sense I am like right before something epic that's gonna happen in the story
450720	455920	like again I'm not gonna give out spoilers I am very you know touchy with
455920	460280	spoilers too it's like don't even joke and chat like we will kick ban you and
460280	463500	we're not at the point I think you have to be about six months out before it's
463500	467360	okay to spoil like you know but I get the feeling I'm coming up on something
467360	472520	pretty epic about to happen in the game also there's something else that a lot
472520	476160	of hints have been dropped for and again I'm being very cautious here I'm not
476160	479320	gonna spoil anything because I don't even know if I'm right but I feel like
479320	483560	there's been a lot of hints dropped over the past couple hours to something in
483560	488960	the story that I kind of didn't see coming and there's one it's one of those
488960	492280	like I haven't seen that in a Final Fantasy game before and if I'm right
492280	496400	it's kind of one of those well played Square Enix well played I think I think
496400	500280	there's something up I can't again I don't want to spoil that uh but
500280	504640	definitely the story in the game is really good like you know I think a lot
504640	507240	of people played through the first three hours and there's definitely your
507240	511440	characters that are likable and dislikable but as that the thing that
511440	516020	was mentioned last week the game is like a banana that slowly peels back to
516020	519300	reveal all of its layers or maybe like an everlasting gobstopper because it
519300	522720	takes so long to get through and there's all these different colored layers you
522720	526200	definitely start to see that there is more to the story than what you saw in
526200	529640	the first few hours I do like very and I do like the weapon upgrade system
529640	532840	because I was like wondering well those components were for big yeah I thought
532840	535720	it's gonna be more of like crafting though instead of like okay these
535720	541160	components equal X number of experience and your levels go up and the weapon
541160	545880	does more damage or whatever well it's interesting it takes so long in the game
545880	548880	before you get to that so yes those of you that haven't gotten that far yet
548880	552080	yes all that crap you're collecting you will use later on to upgrade your
552080	554840	weapons that's not really a spoiler that's that's just a game mechanic
554840	560440	that's nobody yeah so but anyway the story I just got to say I if I'm right
560440	563620	at what I kind of have a hunch is what's going on I'm gonna be like very
563620	566860	interesting and in six months when the moratorium on spoilers is up and it's
566860	571000	okay to spoil I want to get into it cuz it's it's I'm just wondering if we kill
571000	578260	the cyber Pope because you know he looks like he has it coming my favorite
578260	581160	character though I think is still saws because he does have a chocobo that
581160	584160	lives in his hair and the chocobo gets a little more personality as the story
584160	590200	goes on and it's it's disgustingly cute disgustingly cute and I was gonna say
590200	598160	that the Shiva sisters they're their motorcycle is naughty I I am so happy
598160	605240	that Final Fantasy has gone back to this just epic over-the-top summons thing in
605240	609280	the game like that I you back to like Final Fantasy 7 where it was like Knights
609280	614440	of the round and all this well ten yeah ten had it too it did it did there was
614440	617920	one ten did have the Shiva that would come out and snap her fingers and then
617920	621280	the ice would shatter everywhere it's nice to see that again there was one
621280	624800	part though of the game that I didn't like so I mean it was kind of annoying
624800	628960	thankfully it was a really short section of the game but you know they kind of
628960	632480	tried to change the gameplay up a little bit when you get that little mech thing
632480	636320	that you walk around in for about five not even five minutes like two minutes
636320	641000	that was a waste of time I can see why some people are kind of in on Final
641000	645560	Fantasy 13 because it does change things up a lot and yeah you don't really go
645560	649200	out into this world map and go to towns and stuff like you do in a Final Fantasy
649200	652680	game you didn't intend either if you think about it remember it was just the
652680	656200	airship in different spots that you could kind of drop down into it was
656200	660200	exactly these games are kind of like that to Lost Odyssey I there's a lot of
660200	663920	I see in I mean besides the battle systems are completely different but
663920	666840	like the way you move around the map and everything it's very similar to Lost
666840	670680	Odyssey you know you have these relatively linear dungeons with
670680	674320	different branches and so forth you know but Lost Odyssey didn't get a lot of
674320	679360	crap but clearly Final Fantasy 13 is just have an idea what they think Final
679360	684080	Fantasy should be and if it's not that then they're like oh it sucks really
684080	688200	when you look at it it's exactly the same as all the other Final Fantasies so
688200	692120	what so you don't have to wander around aimlessly in like some overworld for a
692120	695840	while big deal tiger claw in our chat room chat that
695840	698760	orange launcher dot-com says sky he would have to wash his talking about
698760	702240	sass sky he would have to wash his hair every day though to clean out all the
702240	705840	chocobo poo I do want to point out the chocobo is capable of flying out of the
705840	709840	hair and you do see that happening so he hopefully is potty trained to know to
709840	713360	fly out of the hair and go to like a nearby tree or something I don't really
713360	717600	get into that and normally animals don't poop where they sleep you know just like
717600	722080	just like to show me you know there's just some cases where you don't have to
722080	727320	explain the bathroom thing like take 24 for example on the show 24 it's so fast
727320	730160	paced and action paced you don't ever stop to really think when do these
730160	733880	characters have time to poo when they're not when they're not showing them you
733880	738080	know it's just like when it goes to some other character but these are things you
738080	741680	do you don't think about because 24 is so action-packed and there's so much
741680	745520	going on you're not supposed to be thinking about gee I wonder if Jack's
745520	752560	gotta go anyhow is our all the scenes always focused on him what's that are
752560	757400	all the scenes always focus no they're not so then he goes he pees well he's
757400	760640	usually in situations where it's not like there's a bathroom nearby like when
760640	764400	he's robbed depends when he's tied to a chair getting tortured depends all right
764400	767800	forget it although that would be awesome to spend a whole episode based on you
767800	772280	know him trying to find a bathroom no it would not be awesome actually canceled
772280	776560	so oh well no NBC might buy it now that they have five hours available on week
776560	781280	nights that's the rumor anyway it can just replace the site show with 24 is a
781280	784240	great show although it's one of those shows where it's like I missed an
784240	787560	episode so now I can't watch like any of it because you miss one you miss
787560	792080	everything it's like lost like people just obsessed with lost and I get why
792080	798800	there's a lot to it but but I again if you missed that first episode I think
798800	805840	you're just lost period anyhow yeah yeah just like Brad from pod culture said he
805840	810400	pees during the commercial break just like everybody else does liquid parrot
810400	813520	and chat room ass I'm playing Final Fantasy 13 now I'm getting five stars
813520	817920	after every battle but what's the point is there even exp in this game there is
817920	821960	not exp but there's crystal points that let you move around the board similar to
821960	828680	Final Fantasy tens level up system the stars I believe affect your loot you can
828680	832960	sometimes get loot affected by the stars I think more importantly your technic
832960	836080	points which I don't know if you're to the point in the game where you're using
836080	840920	those yet but they allow you to cast spells like Libra you will see how that
840920	844080	comes into play if you're not already there the star ratings affect how fast
844080	850280	your bar fills up for technic points so there you go anyhow other games I think
850280	853640	I mentioned Wow I'm playing Warcraft my boyfriend and I made it to Outlands on
853640	856720	the characters we've been working on for a couple months so yay that and the
856720	860680	Megaman 10 came out this week on PlayStation I didn't play it really a
860680	864920	lot I just kind of downloaded it and went in and went ooh I pretty and and
864920	869000	well not really pretty but retro tastic and and I went in and watched the
869000	872240	replays oddly enough that was the first thing I did I went in to watch replays
872240	876120	and watch people just do speed runs on these stages that are insane that's kind
876120	879200	of a cool thing I don't remember if Megaman 9 had that if it did I just
879200	882760	never looked for it but for some reason that jumped right out at me in this
882760	885840	Megaman 10 and that was one of the first things I did so I need to play that a
885840	889800	little more it's nice though that I can watch movies on how to beat stages when
889800	896160	I don't know what to do so that was pretty much it for my gaming week let's
896160	901640	go to some housekeeping Jamie you went to an event today where you played all
901640	904480	these Atari games give us a little wrap-up on what this was all about I
904480	909640	went to the Atari party 2010 which I guess I didn't really know about this
909640	915760	before but apparently they do it every year and it was basically this kind of
915760	922600	house like structure in Davis you had a kitchen and a big room but they just had
922600	930000	Atari systems looked up everywhere and I met a man named Sal who you know I said
930000	934640	I was gonna mention his thing but I put my piece of paper with everything on
934640	942600	there mention it next week I will definitely make a big mention of it but
942600	951600	it was really cool he does a lot of he did soundtracks for a lot of I guess new
951600	957960	releases of our ports of other games you know or releases of prototypes and other
957960	962720	ones like that right now they're working on outrun in space Harrier for a the
962720	970760	Atari XL and the which is a computer version of the the 5200 it's funny his
970760	973760	company's called Atlantis games if that was the name because Atlantis was one and
973760	976720	I thought I looked it up on Wikipedia real quick just to jog my memory I
976720	980520	thought Atlantis was one of those big big Atari 2600 games it was really well
980520	983640	loved and yeah there's some screenshots here was that one of those a magic game
983640	987000	so it had that very unique looking cartridge with like the orange that was
987000	991040	a great 2600 game so I don't know if the company is named and owed to that game
991040	997880	or what but that was one of the better 2600 games sorry so I actually um he
997880	1003760	played a lot of the it's just um some songs that he had done in that format
1003760	1008360	though just for fun like axle F and Actraiser music and Mega Man and
1008360	1013440	different stuff is actually pretty cool isn't amazing Castlevania any synth ask
1013440	1017120	kind of system like you know whenever there's some type of Cynthia type sound
1017120	1023320	involved always has axle F and somehow Van Halen's jump usually makes an
1023320	1029600	appearance at some point to maybe he didn't do it but somebody did well at
1029600	1035480	any rate they also had this is keeping my brain kind of fried from being out so
1035480	1042080	long but they had the DVD game system you know how some of the DVDs for all
1042080	1046000	they were doing like a game system hooked up to it so they had a version of
1046000	1051440	tempest 3000 what I remember tempest 3000 yeah let me see if I can pull it up
1051440	1054760	real quick was that what are those those like little joysticks you hook up to the
1054760	1064320	television but yeah yeah I'm gonna find it interesting well okay so um tempest
1064320	1071480	3000 and by the way it is gorgeous um it uh I'm trying to find what was on it was
1071480	1076000	um because I obviously I remember to the new one the new one is what it is
1076000	1086800	Wow um the it was a DVD a system that had enhanced DVD tools in it and 3d
1086800	1094040	video game playability on it so uh only a few things came out on it but so far I
1094040	1098880	think just tempest 3000 is the only real notable but they had one there and had
1098880	1103720	it hooked up there's a link a picture of it to the chat room but that's uh it
1103720	1108640	looks like an n64 that's what I first Wow that's coming in so I had looked at
1108640	1115640	it and I was like oh no that's a new one yeah so um but I played tempest 3000 and
1115640	1120000	there was actually some video up of Dan playing tempest 3000 because I recorded
1120000	1123920	stuff with my iPhone Jordan on your YouTube it's on my YouTube right now so
1123920	1127480	it's on your YouTube channel yeah I'm gonna give that out publicly or yeah
1127480	1132640	it's all our dark Sakura or dark Sakura or something you know it can you find it
1132640	1141560	Rob yeah um but uh I uh it's a lot of battery your dark Sakura or lr but yeah
1141560	1147240	I did like a couple of sweeps of the party and you know just you know I took
1147240	1154040	a few screens on here's tempest 3000 I want to kind of play this a little bit
1154040	1161320	tempest 2000 but it plays on the laser the DVD players that have you on
1162360	1172720	should I got you to put these on the olr YouTube that's all right I'm just
1172720	1175680	trying to get a look at the game here it's sorry I know this doesn't mean for
1175680	1179280	a great radio but yeah it's very blurry that's the problem with it this is an
1179280	1185400	HDTV it would be a lot better but it's why I still say I prefer tempest 2000 to
1185400	1190680	tempest 3000 because tempest 3000 gives me a headache the score is gigantic in
1190680	1194960	the corner that's kind of the music's the same
1197960	1203640	Wow almost makes me wanna see a new one get added to the gaming vault I can't
1203640	1208480	imagine if I could find one I'm sure they're pretty expensive very cool all
1208480	1213160	right so sorry I was not aware of tempest 3000 yes I would say it's one of
1213160	1216160	those things I've heard of before but I just really haven't seen emotions I've
1216160	1220040	covered it I've covered it when I was covered tempest yeah but it's it's one
1220040	1224480	of those hearing about it and seeing it or and playing it are three different
1224480	1228200	things there were you know there were Jaguars all over the place and you know
1228200	1236040	all varieties of Atari systems it was pretty fun it was pretty fun and I'm
1236040	1243920	actually thinking I'll find the stuff a little bit later for everybody but the
1243920	1249320	the guy I talked to has an eBay store and he sells the refurbished excels for
1249320	1254760	like 70 bucks which isn't bad because you know they're all you know set up to
1254760	1262560	work with s video so and you know he sells most of cartridges that they do
1262560	1265960	for like 30 bucks I mean it is you know time and effort went into it is pretty
1265960	1270720	much a new version of the game except he did tempest extreme well they did tempest
1270720	1276000	extreme that because of how much work and everything that went into getting it
1276000	1281820	to run properly it's actually a 50 buck game but I've seen it in motion played
1281820	1287940	it well worth it so it was pretty good all right the Atari party a little local
1287940	1293340	event sounds like a PlayStation there and I was like hey you're at the Atari
1293340	1296220	party or were they playing the Atari collection maybe on the PlayStation
1296220	1300420	night that might be so no I just heard the little PlayStation chime and I was
1300420	1306880	like hey that doesn't belong here you get that or you get that out oh and um
1306880	1312720	they also had one of the mountain you know ran into Neil there mm-hmm and I
1312720	1317560	didn't get to see it he cuz I was talking to the the XL the guy had south
1317560	1320440	we were talking about the music and everything by the way since I don't
1320440	1323600	think Neil's ever been on this program he's no buddy of mine from like junior
1323600	1327120	high school we've known each other a very long time and so he goes some of
1327120	1331440	these nerd things too yeah you he also does rocky a big part of that and is a
1331440	1343080	big nerd so he also gave me that I'm act that's collecting dust under the pinball table but the crap he told me that they had
1343080	1350400	choo-choo rocket on one of on the the you know I'm gonna see what what it is
1350400	1353680	oh what are the Atari systems like somebody poured in it yeah no Wow I'm
1353680	1358040	seeing what it was I just you know completely unplugged my phone sorry on a
1358040	1365440	1040 Wow so that's pretty cool lots of retro love people still making new games
1365440	1370320	on old systems it's kind of funny and yes Amiga 777 it was a Jaguar someone
1370320	1375280	had Jaguar CD hooked up to iron soldier was one of the engineer playing so I was
1375280	1382160	like hey whatever all right let's um other housekeeping tonight don't forget

1429360	1434120	Fantasy 6 those are the final matchups we don't have that many votes but both

1454440	1459160	orange lounge radio.com and click on forums talk to you guys later bye bye
1459160	1463160	very interesting matchup in the final four is it to Zelda games somehow made
1463160	1468280	it to the final four but Final Fantasy 6 is up against Ocarina of Time got to
1468280	1471520	tell you my vote went to Final Fantasy 6 that's that's one of my favorite Final
1471520	1475720	Fantasy is probably I don't know if I do I would give it the six to I and don't
1475720	1479720	get me wrong I realize I've said my piece on Ocarina of Time and it's still
1479720	1483480	a great great great game but Final Fantasy 6 is like a great great great
1483480	1487920	great great game the other matchup is Link to the Past versus Chrono Trigger I
1487920	1491880	personally voted for Link to the Past but I know of course Chrono Trigger has
1491880	1496040	this extremely loyal fan base I really wouldn't be surprised to see that win
1496040	1500120	although what you know Link to the Past if I had a Super Nintendo sitting in
1500120	1503080	front of me and both of those carts I'd reach for Link to the Past I would I
1503080	1506640	would probably play through more of that one sitting than I could Chrono Trigger
1506640	1510920	too but anyway it doesn't really matter what I think it's what you guys think so
1510920	1513800	go check that out in our forums we'll have more updates on the winner and if
1513800	1516520	you don't like the games that are there we'll poo on you you should have been
1516520	1520800	voting or sending your top 25 list like we told you to like couple months ago so
1520800	1523120	if you missed your chance this year don't worry you have get to do it all
1523120	1530960	again next year all right um let's see SHA100 Matt in our chat says Ocarina
1530960	1535200	isn't a Link to the Past that's true but Link to the Past did have an Ocarina in
1535200	1538480	it if I remember right didn't it wasn't it one of the early ones where you at
1538480	1541280	least it had like a whistle type thing like some sort of whistle that looked
1541280	1544080	like an Ocarina it's kind of like a really really old
1544080	1548380	integration of that anyhow let's get into some actual gaming news what is
1548380	1552280	going on new in the world obviously lots and lots happened this week we gave
1552280	1557280	developers conference but first some other big news that wasn't from GDC
1557280	1562880	right Loki yeah there's and this isn't too surprising just you know from their
1562880	1567760	track record of what's been released recently but apparently Majesco is kind
1567760	1572680	of going the way of Midway and Atari where it's now being threatened by
1572680	1578360	Nasdaq with a delisting apparently again this is not the first time that
1578360	1583520	this has happened the company now has 180 calendar days to bring its stock a
1583520	1588960	price above $1 per share the minimum required to remain on the exchange the
1588960	1596320	trick is though that they can't it it can't just pop up it's a fiscally or
1596320	1601720	fiscally hurting head above a bucket for a day and everything will be good you
1601720	1607480	know fine it has to stay above the $1 mark I guess for a minimum of 10
1607480	1615880	consecutive trading days prior to August 30th 2010 now if you think about it
1615880	1621280	Majesco hasn't released much for a while I mean you're really there big franchise
1621280	1626520	right now is cooking mama and cooking mama's what like gardening mama and I
1626520	1630960	mean they've kind of dug that into the ground haven't they yeah I mean it's
1630960	1635040	they've got a few games coming out of like there's a Pirates of plunder are
1635040	1639640	supposed to be coming out soon but I mean come on between Pirates of plunder
1639640	1643440	flips twisted world you know a bunch of these secondary titles there for the Wii
1643440	1650280	and yes I just don't I don't really see this happening I mean they don't have a
1650280	1657360	date they put out the mad dog McCree pack on Wii oh whoa well I guess I'm
1657360	1662800	wrong I know exactly yeah I'm looking at the list of Majesco stuff and I'm kind
1662800	1666560	of like oh boy oh there's I mean they have the Teen Titans license which I'm
1666560	1669920	sure sell some games I mean I'm not I'm not really they haven't used they
1669920	1675440	haven't put I haven't done in a while a few years they have a Texas Hold'em game
1675440	1681960	on DS but those are a dime it does those are like years old okay stray the blood
1681960	1685720	rain games but again those are kind of old news they haven't been doing a no
1685720	1691000	they've only really been doing like DS and Wii titles and they've been very
1691000	1695640	secondary I'm sorry to say I mean like like I said the last few games have come
1695640	1704240	out from them okay Data East arcade classics collection yeah that's a nice
1704240	1708560	collection of games but it's not gonna sell like the the copies that they need
1708560	1715440	the make money I mean it's just no triple-a title or even really a titles a
1715440	1720320	lot of let me a lot of seat on this way like a company in like 505 games I mean
1720320	1726120	they're like pretty brand-new I mean they're relatively new like a few years
1726120	1731080	old and they put out a lot of crap but they're putting out more games and these
1731080	1734600	guys are and they actually have some decent titles coming up that are pretty
1734600	1737480	notable like naughty bear or something like that well they may not also be
1737480	1740960	traded on the stock market either keep in mind that we're not talking about if
1740960	1744520	they get delisted from the stock market they're gonna just go under immediately
1744520	1748880	although that's although that's a side effect yeah but it well it's our
1748880	1753920	Atari's still kicking I mean not as much as they used to but they're kicking
1753920	1759480	they're kicking with the float even there you know kickboard but it's just
1759480	1764360	it's not what it was I mean Midway they went under and all their assets got
1764360	1768480	bought out Majesco I could see that happening I mean you know gardening mama
1768480	1772360	that could be something or like you know the cooking mama series that could be
1772360	1776400	something that probably fit with like Ubisoft even SSJ 100 Matt makes an
1776400	1779560	excellent point in our chat room chat that orange on city.com they should have
1779560	1783480	brought president cat over before they go under because president cat would be
1783480	1789040	a triple-a title indeed it would hold out hope for e3 at
1789040	1794080	Majesco's booth you never know you never know if president cat does show up at e3
1794080	1797680	I will be going over to the booth of the person who had the balls to put it out
1797680	1801440	saying would you like to shake my hand
1801440	1808880	I'd be all sorts of like crazy oh by the way and it you know like they did with
1808880	1813920	any three last year in Nintendo's press conference oh by the way here's a
1813920	1820480	Metroid other M trailer it's like oh by the way I think we have a candidate for
1820480	1824880	a perfect title this holiday season this election season we have the candidate
1824880	1831920	for you I would just I'd lose it I would all right yeah I'd be on the floor
1831920	1837160	shaking and crying all right now all right for real though other stuff going
1837160	1843200	on quaking in your mantis I would I would anyhow PlayStation move was
1843200	1846320	revealed this week a game developers conference I'm sure any of you guys that
1846320	1849960	actively follow the gaming blogs have heard about this it's not the arc or
1849960	1853640	anything like that it is the PlayStation move is the name of the controller and
1853640	1858800	it made its debut at GDC they are promising that it will launch for less
1858800	1865520	than $100 which means like what $99 right $99.99 $99 and then there's been a
1865520	1870840	lot of the little thing that they were doing their conference talking about so
1870840	1875680	calm for because so calm is going to be the big franchise that gets the support
1875680	1880600	of PlayStation move this year and they were cut I noticed they went out of
1880600	1886200	their way to say look how you don't go flailing about like you know they really
1886200	1889560	kind of tried to poke fun at the weed very subtly they said notice how he's
1889560	1893500	not flailing about he made these very subtle motions and I gotta say granted
1893500	1896960	I'm not a so calm player so I didn't really know what to look for but you
1896960	1899920	could see the dude sitting there and if it was a live demo which I have no
1899920	1904640	reason to doubt that it was it looked pretty yeah he's just kind of using it
1904640	1909640	as a another way to control the game that's just like you know the Call of
1909640	1915240	Duty games that are on the Wii I mean it's it can be done I mean you can just
1915240	1920000	use the the one controller as a pointer and then the other one the kind of
1920000	1925360	control your movements and then maybe throw in some different like motion
1925360	1928960	sensitive commands that you can do for different things well I know they were
1928960	1933080	trying to really make it a point to to say look at the precision this thing has
1933080	1937200	great precision this is a precise controller like they were really trying
1937200	1940760	to take a jab at the fact that the we can sometimes be a little all over the
1940760	1944680	place and I do agree it's probably gonna be more precise but because they've had
1944680	1949920	more time to perfect the technology exactly but I mean from what they're
1949920	1954640	showings were of what they're gonna be putting out come on you're not that much
1954640	1960360	better than Nintendo like for example iPad well okay iPad you know and now we
1960360	1964920	finally understand why that title is delayed forever and and that's kind of
1964920	1969120	neat it's different because it's a little bit of augmented reality stuff in
1969120	1975920	there but mainly I was saying you know move party come on oh great more party
1975920	1979360	game collections yeah it's like you know what though if that's what sells that's
1979360	1982880	what sells no no no and I don't have a problem with them doing that because
1982880	1986920	it's kind of neat to see like you know that kind of a party game with actually
1986920	1991840	good graphics in it you know what I mean and it would be neat if they actually
1991840	1996080	figure out unique ways to do this but do they've got an archery game in there
1996080	2002880	it's just like the fucking archery game and we sports you know resort HD oh who
2002880	2005960	cares well to be fair there's a Lord of the Rings game coming to for what it's
2005960	2011400	worth that's a port of a Wii game and looks like it and then they do they did
2011400	2014960	make sure to stress that they had so many companies behind it like they
2014960	2018520	showed a slide where there was just logos all over pretty much all their
2018520	2023080	big publishers are jumping on board with move somehow which isn't too big of a
2023080	2027440	surprise honestly it'll just be interesting to see if there's that must
2027440	2031880	have game there's that must-have game that really sells the move I don't know
2031880	2036000	if so com4 is it I mean so com4 don't get me wrong so com4 there's a lot of
2036000	2039680	so com fans and especially because they they've made it a point to say you don't
2039680	2042600	have to use move you don't want it was just you know something that's there too
2042600	2047080	exactly and I like how they do have the option there and options are good I'm
2047080	2050480	surprised Sony's jumping on that bandwagon because you know that wasn't
2050480	2053760	really something that was their mantra but so calm isn't really that title that
2053760	2057880	has crossed the line to get everybody interested including the soccer moms
2057880	2060720	which are important because it's their credit card usually with the kids you
2060720	2066800	know it'll be neat just I think the PlayStation moves like the move party
2066800	2072720	stuff will be okay especially if they're gonna bundle that with the software but
2072720	2079360	my thing is though too is you gotta buy you know at least one of these is gonna
2079360	2082960	come with your kit or whatever that's gonna have the camera which I don't even
2082960	2087800	really need this because I have the camera already okay so you have to buy
2087800	2091200	one of those controllers which let's assume it's the same price as you know
2091200	2096180	the Wii the Wii remotes like 40 bucks okay well those things they have two of
2096180	2099980	them they have one that's kind of like a nunchuck type of controller air sub
2099980	2103840	controller whatever that looks exactly the same I have a feeling it's gonna be
2103840	2109000	another $40 okay so great I have you an $80 set of controllers here that's for
2109000	2115400	one player now I need it for the other three Oh goody so there you know what
2115400	2119640	you've spent a good 200 you know three hundred and twenty dollars on fucking
2119640	2123720	controllers dark soccer oh what are your thoughts on move what's with the light
2123720	2128080	bulb I think isn't it like be able to see the different players and where they
2128080	2131560	are in the room type of thing um that and because it's something that the
2131560	2135840	camera can track oh yeah cuz it's all camera that's why they have LED thing
2135840	2139400	little like glowing balls on like people when they're motion capturing them and
2139400	2144640	stuff like that hmm I don't know again I'm kind of torn like I'm I look at
2144640	2148520	PlayStation move and I go oh okay neat I like what Sony's doing with that but
2148520	2152000	then I look at it and go yeah but there's nothing I there's nothing that's
2152000	2155340	gonna make me run out and buy this day one right now you know again I'm not
2155340	2159300	really the SOCOM fan that doesn't really speak to me I don't know these minigame
2159300	2162680	collections don't look anything better than the Wii except maybe the graphics
2162680	2165520	there's nothing that makes me go OMG got to get one of these day one here's the
2165520	2169260	problem is that they haven't figured out why they're not selling as well that's
2169260	2172260	really what it comes down to is they think oh my god it's because you know
2172260	2176700	this other console has motion sensitive stuff that's why it's selling well no
2176700	2180080	it's because it has casual games and games that feel the family so that's why
2180080	2184480	it's selling well I just think it's too little too late you think they're
2184480	2190000	jumping into this too late heck yeah hmm I mean I think that the Microsoft has
2190000	2194440	the better idea you know well basically what they're trying to do with this is
2194440	2199040	that they're trying to put it themselves on equal footing with the Nintendo Wii
2199040	2203000	and basically then it's gonna be okay look these both of these systems have
2203000	2208000	you in the motion technology now let's compare the rest of the features and
2208000	2211600	when you compare the rest of the features the we just looks like
2211600	2215240	something for the last generation minute this thing comes out there will be that
2215240	2218720	bundle that includes move that they're really gonna be pushing the holiday
2218720	2224200	season hey it's a blu-ray and a we type thing in one that's that's what it is
2224200	2229560	that's Sony's strategy I'm sure it does everything it only does everything
2229560	2235160	except but to be fair I mean Sony's made a lot of made a lot of ground in the
2235160	2239320	past couple years I mean I think they've got to do this they're so way behind in
2239320	2243880	the numbers and it's it's a good idea but here's the other thing even with
2243880	2247800	the toll the toll is going to be the same problem I think and even to a
2247800	2251360	greater extent at least with the tall and I'll give them credit for this at
2251360	2256280	least in the tall I don't the fucking buy $320 with the controllers it's the
2256280	2261000	camera that's it done I don't have to make any more fucking purchases at all
2261000	2264800	well speaking of the tall I think dark soccer has got a story for us that kind
2264800	2268600	of talks about Microsoft although they didn't they didn't get to do the keynote
2268600	2272960	at GDC if that doesn't mean there's no news on the tall well um they're
2272960	2278440	basically stating that they're gonna have the full lineup of the natal titles
2278440	2284760	at e3 which will be cool of course they've got EA Capcom turn 10 spawn
2284760	2290720	point behind them and that they are quote putting their best people on the
2290720	2298520	on the job so uh they should actually be seeing some pretty good stuff this June
2298520	2303120	what big Xbox franchise do you think might natal be I mean I guess we've
2303120	2306720	heard fable already yeah my thought and I remember making this prediction earlier
2306720	2309400	in the year and I don't remember if it was on the show or on one of the forums
2309400	2314280	or what have you but I remember saying I think Gears of War 3 is gonna be
2314280	2318400	unveiled at e3 and it's gonna have natal support and it's kind of funny that
2318400	2322960	SOCOM showed up with the PlayStation move because when I saw that I was like
2322960	2327720	wow that's kind of that's kind of close ish that's like Playstations kind of
2327720	2332600	sudary type game as long as they take a mature approach with it like you know
2332600	2338000	where it's it makes sense for the game not just it seems tacked on as long as
2338000	2342400	they layling about like an idiot but they they Sony made a big point to say
2342400	2346320	you will not flail around like an idiot so if they do it right again I'm talking
2346320	2350720	out my ass it just seems like it's odd to me we have heard nothing about Gears
2350720	2356080	of War 3 I have this strange feeling you know it's gonna happen those games are
2356080	2360240	huge sellers I have this strange feeling that's the elephant behind the curtain
2360240	2363400	that's gonna show at e3 when dark soccer talks about they're bringing all their
2363400	2368580	natal titles I my gut tells me that's one of them oh I'm also though looking
2368580	2371320	in terms of course there's gonna be sports games that are gonna use it
2371320	2375120	although I would like to see how it would work with like a racing game if it
2375120	2379100	would be something like you foresee you know what I mean well I think they
2379100	2382020	showed in one of those previews right somebody was like grabbing us I think
2382020	2385240	there was like a racing game you see the little happy family grabbing a steering
2385240	2390120	wheel yeah you know natal I'm approaching with this big grain of salt
2390120	2395280	as to how well it's actually gonna work because I go I feel like it's like the
2395280	2400480	PlayStation I now granted the or not the I the I toy sorry granted the
2400480	2403480	technologies come a long way in the past few years I just really hope we see that
2403480	2409880	and I hope at e3 they show natal in a realistic environment and not against a
2409880	2413600	really well-lit white wall although you know that's what they're gonna do so
2413600	2417320	that it's super uber responsive because part of me is like how's this really
2417320	2421520	gonna work in my living room I want them to do it in front of a big red wall or
2421520	2425440	something or what a tacky curtain out of the 1970s I could see in my house or
2425440	2431600	like remember the we demo stations I had up at e3 that year with the couch mm-hmm
2431600	2434720	they just made little living rooms why don't they do something like that I'm
2434720	2438520	hoping that's what we see again I don't know e3 is a couple months away I don't
2438520	2442520	even know if I'm going at this point to be honest I want to go but I want to but
2442520	2449360	I have other priorities this year yeah not this year I just really the only
2449360	2452360	thing that I think right now is an advantage for them is that I don't buy
2452360	2456400	extra accessories because really that's gonna be just like and that's gonna be
2456400	2461760	a big I hope they push that it's okay hey look you gotta buy $320 worth of
2461760	2465400	crap and granted I'm throwing these numbers out my ass but I mean look at
2465400	2474480	the we lesser technology same price you know I gotta buy all this kind of extra
2474480	2480800	stuff to get to work versus its camera it's done you just plug it and go you
2480800	2486280	are the controller you know that's it but then again since I am the controller
2486280	2492080	I can only see ridiculous shit happening with that setup because they're gonna
2492080	2495120	make you flail around they're gonna make you do stupid shit that's unnecessary
2495120	2500400	just like those stupid little concept demo videos that they had where people
2500400	2507280	are screwing in nuts on a fucking tire in a race or something like that it's
2507280	2513120	unnecessary but they think of some really cool ways to like you know play
2513120	2519200	first-person shooters somehow more power to them I will see a little ways off but
2519200	2522240	again I think Microsoft's gonna have that same approach to Sony come the
2522240	2526120	holiday season now it's the Xbox 360 with in the tall or whatever they call
2526120	2530200	it I mean it's not gonna mean it's all I it's not gonna be that either it's kind
2530200	2532720	of weird they still have not announced the name but I guess like you know they
2532720	2536640	could still do it at e3 announce the name until they announce name it's funny
2536640	2540840	GDC I get it but but he threes it's fun up a little why they named it moved
2540840	2544680	right because they couldn't get the trademark for arc well really yeah who
2544680	2549080	had a trademark uh there's some some issue with them not being able to get
2549080	2552960	you get the trademark so they have to go with move instead I think PlayStation
2552960	2556960	moves a better name just from the because their logo still the arc but
2556960	2562680	it's an a looking thing I kind of think it's the better name for the mass market
2562680	2567120	I think a lot of other but then again what do I know the we what a dumb name
2567120	2571960	that was and yet it worked I tend to strategy why it worked I know simple
2571960	2577880	easy to remember easy market they made they made it into a adjective for games
2577880	2583400	like to Xerox something or to get a Kleenex they made the we just like how
2583400	2587720	people used to say oh we know we isn't we is not a generic yet no I know it's
2587720	2592200	not a generic but it's that got that household recognition it'd be like
2592200	2599680	bounty for paper towels all right let's move on with some more gaming news that
2599680	2605200	maybe don't involve motion well it might but we never know oh that's true that's
2605200	2610080	true that was something they're talking about but apparently though it has been
2610080	2615920	announced that Rockman 3 will be making its way out this holiday season not a
2615920	2620600	big surprise I mean they took kind of a year off file that next to duh and of
2620600	2625520	course yeah so I'll be out this this holiday season of course they said
2625520	2629200	that's going to innovate and then revolutionize the music genre once again
2629200	2633320	obviously they're gonna be adding of course you know the three-part harmonies
2633320	2638280	in there again in fact another game that will feature said three-part harmonies
2638280	2643200	is also Green Day Rock Band which has now been announced to be releasing on
2643200	2650440	June 8th worldwide also on the three major platforms Xbox 360 ps3 and we and
2650440	2655120	it's of course we'll use up to six players three mics three instruments and
2655120	2662600	they will also have apparently the ability to import the tracks as well or
2662600	2667760	export the tracks in the Rock Band 2 as well there's gonna be all 47 tracks that
2667760	2673000	are in the game will be exportable for I guess 10 bucks so it's basically
2673000	2677880	Beatles Rock Band but now with I'm day and you can export the tracks I don't
2677880	2682920	even see it as this this release to me is not even as big as Beatles Rock Band
2682920	2688080	I think this is more like guitar your own Metallica but at least you can
2688080	2692800	export the tracks can't do that shit with Metallica or Beatles or Van Halen
2692800	2697080	yeah or reels but Beatles that was a different situation it was kind of
2697080	2701200	Beatles are in a little category of their own to you know it Beatles is
2701200	2704160	there there's not a lot of bands that can get away with just being in their
2704160	2708240	own bubble the music game genre but Beatles can Green Day don't think
2708240	2711200	they're there yet but this this is this will be nice for them they have I mean
2711200	2715120	they have a lot of easily recognizable songs that you know I think the export
2715120	2720360	feature will be very popular too yeah and also they said that there's gonna be
2720360	2727320	a special edition Green Day Rock Band Plus that will come as to Xbox 360 and
2727320	2733440	ps3 for $69.99 includes fancier packaging and an export feature I guess
2733440	2737400	a voucher to export the discs to the hard drive and six previously released
2737400	2743360	Green Day DLC tracks um at depth in our chat room chat that owners on trading
2743360	2746920	com says also George Harrison's son already said that there would be a rock
2746920	2751080	band 3 and it will help you learn to play real instruments wouldn't that be
2751080	2755960	interesting if that's kind of the tie-in is is more making it real I don't know I
2755960	2761320	part of me says maybe there should be a new instrument but then I think it came
2761320	2764720	up a couple months ago on the show I think the idea had come up that maybe
2764720	2768560	what rock band 3 is gonna introduce is something like the sing star space where
2768560	2773280	you upload your own stuff to like a youtubey type of site I my gut tells me
2773280	2777080	that's gonna be rock band threes thing especially with the network taking off
2777080	2782160	as it is and so forth I think rock band 3 is gonna be really about now you can
2782160	2785920	watch your friends rock out from you know across the country all I gotta say
2785920	2790760	man is by the time that comes out I mean it's ridiculous the amount of tracks you
2790760	2795000	can have you can have like about over a thousand tracks right now that are in
2795000	2799800	that game I mean that's the way you do a music game right there you have the
2799800	2803360	download content I mean literally there's a whole library of stuff to pick
2803360	2807160	from and you can just take keep taking it with you through each and you know
2807160	2812480	reiteration of the game all right well moving on to other news kind of a
2812480	2815320	follow-up to last week you know obviously last week we had a very fun
2815320	2818640	show here at olr while the Oscars were going on but something else that was
2818640	2822800	going on at the time was that Ubisoft games were unplayable because they're
2822800	2827920	their whole service was down and apparently and I think I had suggested
2827920	2833440	this when somebody said it on the show it was indeed a DOS attack it sounds
2833440	2837240	like hackers went in servers were attacked which limited service from 2
2837240	2843880	30 p.m. to 9 p.m. Paris time 8 30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Eastern that was announced by by
2843880	2847880	the company on their Twitter so of course they wanted to cover their tracks
2847880	2851800	real quick saying oh but yeah most players 95% of players they weren't
2851800	2855160	affected yeah because most people were still sleeping on the west coast at that
2855160	2859360	time but still no I mean in all seriousness they tried to cover
2859360	2863360	themselves saying a bunch of players weren't affected probably because they
2863360	2869000	didn't try to play the game but again just kind of goes to show how their DRM
2869000	2872320	system is ridiculous and was already cracked as we talked about last week
2872320	2877160	correct yes because there's the code in there that very similar to steam if
2877160	2880280	steam ever goes bankrupt which I don't think they're going to anytime soon no
2880280	2883720	steam were to ever go under all those games would have to be activated without
2883720	2888280	steam's presence and Ubisoft's games have something similar someone found it
2888280	2894680	and went and unlock that for everybody hey what's this button do ah there it is
2894680	2899200	togak in our chat room says haha I hope they get DDoS more so they learn their
2899200	2904040	lesson I don't know if I'm really an advocate of DDoS thing but I think this
2904040	2907840	certainly shows the weakness of why this should have never been done in the first
2907840	2916520	place yep ah well how about something that's a little bit less irritating what
2916520	2922040	do you think Rob sure Akira Yomoka huh he's good to hear about him he is the
2922040	2926120	less irritating what's he up to lately I it's nice to hear him on a video game
2926120	2929640	podcast because you know when he left Konami there was a little worried that
2929640	2933520	oh he's leaving to go start a band or do something not to do with games
2933520	2938160	whatsoever we did a panel at game developers conference that I'm talking
2938160	2945000	about as long as audio is fun the game will be too that's what it was called but
2945000	2951960	he was talking about how the audio how the music goes into provoking a certain
2951960	2958440	emotion like it one of the examples given is that if you sync the sound just
2958440	2962880	off by a few frames of animation that like if you do it beforehand it'll give
2962880	2967360	a tone of anxiety to it but if you do it afterwards it's more comforting like
2967360	2971760	starting the sound of footsteps just a fraction of you know a moment before the
2971760	2975880	the action happens on the scene and they're talking about the use of silence
2975880	2981600	and he's quoted as saying when there's no sound the brain fills in the gap and
2981600	2988320	then actually went to play you know some music with with gaps of silence and then
2988320	2993040	went back in and added sharp sounds to it of course which freaked people out but
2993040	2997880	it was I think it's very effective and then he played some guitar for everybody
2997880	3002440	to chill him out I could see that because that's kind of silent Hills
3002440	3005160	thing is that sometimes it'll be very quiet when you're walking around all you
3005160	3009120	hear those footsteps that I'm sure are off sync like he talks about there you
3009120	3011680	walk around with the footsteps and all of a sudden you start hearing the radio
3011680	3014480	noise the very uncomfortable kind of noise and that's how you know something's
3014480	3018760	up interesting to kind of hear the science behind that it's it's it's
3018760	3025400	simple psychology I mean they even you know I remember back in the day when I
3025400	3032480	took music theory they were talking about the use of sharp dissonance or how
3032480	3037560	about are setting things in a certain key like setting thing if I remember
3037560	3042000	correctly setting things in the key of E is actually a very uncomfortable key to
3042000	3048120	listen to things in I mean the setting and see very neutral you know same type
3048120	3052880	of thing Wow there's a whole science behind it no word though about sadly
3052880	3056240	what he's working on now or what have you you know I was it wasn't there some
3056240	3059840	rumor something came up a while back that he was in cahoots with EA doing
3059840	3062960	something I want to say something had come up on the show like a while ago
3062960	3068400	maybe one of the chatters wants to fill in I seriously think though we haven't
3068400	3077800	heard on the article though yeah very cool all right let's travel around the
3077800	3081200	world and look at some release dates and what's coming out to a video game store
3081200	3086000	near you that maybe won't make you so uncomfortable well these games make me
3086000	3090200	uncomfortable because I can't believe that they're still being made well
3090200	3094080	technically this is not really a new game it's just kind of remade anyways
3094080	3100680	Pokemon heart gold and soul silver are out today on the Nintendo DS later this

3195840	3200600	use like oozies and rocket launchers which is all sorts of cool hidden
3200600	3206040	mysteries Buckingham Palace secrets of kings and queens on the DS another
3206040	3211800	casual title there pizza delivery boy kind of a little bit across between
3211800	3219680	cooking mama and crazy taxi on the Wii Hall of Fame ultimate hoops challenge
3219680	3228120	budget basketball game on the Wii and not really a game but the new elites are
3228120	3233000	supposed to be coming out this week bundled with Halo 3 ODST and Forza 3
3233000	3237880	and that's it all right traveling over to Japan to look at the releases that
3237880	3243800	are coming out over there on the Xbox 360 Darksiders comes out kind of say
3243800	3249800	actiony ish game from Konami that I've seen described as God of War meets Zelda
3249800	3256960	I'm sure that's interesting also on the Xbox 360 Momo to Jai Dyson Ryaku ultra
3256960	3262000	deluxe comes out kind of a strategy type of game with these chibi little bombers
3262000	3266960	and of course anime girls as the captains but it looks kind of cute don't
3266960	3269560	think that'll be a game that comes out here though so you'll have to import
3269560	3275200	that one that's pretty much it on the Xbox 360 PlayStation 3 has some exciting
3275200	3278720	titles this week though PlayStation 3 is having something in Japan coming out
3278720	3282920	this week called torn and it's also coming out with a bundle and it's not a
3282920	3288060	game actually it's a DVR type system that I guess will turn your ps3 into a
3288060	3291480	DVR type thing with listings and everything and I'm just thinking wow I
3291480	3294560	wish something like that would come out here that sounds pretty awesome you hear
3294560	3298840	about this like on the 360 in Europe with the what the u-verse I think and
3298840	3303040	maybe that happens in like a limited capacity here but sadly you don't work
3303040	3307720	on my cable system but that is coming out in Japan this week very cool also
3307720	3316920	Ryu Ga Gotoku 4 Densetsu wo Sugumono 4 comes out this week in Japan I believe
3316920	3322240	that is Yakuza 4 which is kind of funny because we just got Yakuza 3 this week
3322240	3327200	in the u.s. so and of course is some of the articles that we've had recently on
3327200	3331320	orange laundry calm written by our lovely webmaster deke man they cut some
3331320	3335280	crap out of Yakuza 3 which is not making people happy I was thinking I was
3335280	3339080	Twitter you saying something like 20 different side quests and stuff we're
3339080	3344920	all cut so hopefully if they do decide to port Yakuza 4 which just came out on
3344920	3350520	the ps3 in Japan this week they will not cut so darn much also on the ps3 this
3350520	3354760	week in Japan the God of War collection it makes its way to Japan that's pretty
3354760	3358000	much it on the ps3 going to the Nintendo Wii there really isn't much there's just
3358000	3363280	one little title from Squeenix Oh Yaku de Asobo Miphi no Omocha Bako I
3363280	3366400	wouldn't get too excited because I said that was Squeenix it honestly looks like
3366400	3370480	like a Sesame Street type of game featuring little rabbit characters that
3370480	3374480	honestly their mouths look like buttholes like I don't have a better way
3374480	3379200	to explain it but if you look at their little mouths they look like balloon
3379200	3385600	knots and I wouldn't yeah get too excited about that but hey there you go
3386640	3391960	what are they showing to their children over there Sengoku Basara 2 on the
3391960	3397680	PlayStation 2 gets a price reduction this week and going over to the Nintendo
3397680	3406960	DS Haki Oki on the DS from idea factory a crayon game yay crayons and lastly
3406960	3413880	going to the PSP Gundam assault survive comes out and oh this is a fun one of it
3413880	3418400	Jamie will be excited for this ease one and two the seven set comes out in Japan
3418400	3422560	nice they've ported those games a couple times over in Japan haven't they I like
3422560	3427360	East I don't think I've seen him out over here oh I've got yes are they are
3427360	3435200	they okay very cool all right Kevo in our chat wants to know why did the hell
3435200	3438880	they cut so much of it I believe speaking about Yakuza 3 I believe long
3438880	3442720	story short there were some things that they felt were well a you could just say
3442720	3446000	they were being lazy but they rationalized it I think some of it was
3446000	3451720	like mahjong minigames which you know it's not really a huge game here in the
3451720	3456680	US so I guess they figured people would know how to play it and I think types of
3456680	3460800	just like social things that are big in Japan because you know you the Yakuza
3460800	3466240	series is very big on trying to like emulate what Japan is feeling like in a
3466240	3470280	certain era so there's a lot of like social things that are built into the
3470280	3473840	game and I guess Sega just felt some things were not worth translating or
3473840	3476620	trying to explain to the English audience but obviously some of the
3476620	3481120	hardcore fans are a little ticked off I see a lot of friends of mine really into
3481120	3484060	this game though so I don't think it's really affecting you know I think if
3484060	3487840	you're a fan of Yakuza you're gonna grumble and cry but you still end up
3487840	3496040	playing it so all right let's move on to the UK dark Sakura on the 16th we have
3496040	3503160	Dragon Age origins awakening the 17th perfect dark and on the 18th the calling
3503160	3509640	on we 19th blaze blue calamity trigger command and conquer for Tiberian
3509640	3523720	Twilight God of War 3 Metro 2033 moto GP 910 and supreme commander to it yeah
3523720	3532680	all right okay let's see so one of the big things that they were talking about
3532680	3538760	during GDC and actually something that might be kind of talked about during e3
3538760	3544120	last year was on live the streaming service that's gonna be available for I
3544120	3549080	guess PCs and max that's gonna allow you to play basically a whole bunch of you
3549080	3553200	know big games everything from like crisis to you know just very casual
3553200	3559060	games and they're all gonna be able to be streamed I guess to your you know PC
3559060	3565320	with just you know very little hardware whatsoever and they announced that
3565320	3570880	they're gonna be launching their service June 17th and it will be $15 per month
3570880	3580400	and what's gonna you know offer this is depending on I guess you know they're
3580400	3584520	gonna have like a micro console that's gonna be released later on I guess like
3584520	3591280	a set-top box if you will that you can actually use instead of your PC and I
3591280	3596920	guess also you'll be able to they're gonna have some upgrades later on
3596920	3602520	they're gonna offer 1080p support at 60 frames per second as I guess more
3602520	3609280	bandwidth becomes available and on live I guess is gonna be going the first like
3609280	3614760	three months they're only only allow 25,000 people in I guess they're gonna
3614760	3620920	be staggering all when people can join up probably because they don't have all
3620920	3625040	their servers online but I mean I don't know if you're gonna want to jump on
3625040	3628120	board right away because really they're not gonna have a whole lot of titles
3628120	3633320	available at launch they're really only gonna have less than about 20 titles at
3633320	3639800	launch and it's gonna grow somewhere to about 50 to 60 games by 2011 some of the
3639800	3646240	games that they're gonna be available on the service they are mentioning that
3646240	3652480	Mass Effect 2 Dragon Age origins also later on Prince of Persia the Forgotten
3652480	3660760	Sands will be available and apparently I guess 250,000 people signed up for the
3660760	3665680	online beta not that all of them were let in and it says they expect that
3665680	3672040	demand will far outweigh the capacity of the services servers and so that they're
3672040	3675240	gonna actually have people pre subscribe well of course they want to fluff it up
3675240	3679120	sold out hard to get into exclusive you know because they want to pump people up
3679120	3683280	I explain you know I'm not knocking this because certainly I think this story has
3683280	3688320	kind of come up before and you know it's kind of been just poo-pooed office oh
3688320	3692320	yeah sure that'll happen but now there's no really we're gonna have this out in
3692320	3696320	the fall and we plan to do this console and everything but explain to me real
3696320	3699560	quick and I realize there's a science behind this but I need it really broken
3699560	3702520	down for me here because I don't understand hardware so much how is this
3702520	3710280	not game tap this is basically I don't know I think it's gonna be more
3710280	3716240	sophisticated games basically it's not just like emulating old games or older
3716240	3721540	PC titles it's like you're you know say for example you have a crappy computer
3721540	3726120	that happens to be on a decent network you can run crisis now on it basically
3726120	3732480	with very little lag or no lag at all burnout you're gonna be able to run that
3732480	3737200	kind of stuff who knows if they'll go into a game tap type of situation later
3737200	3739960	on where they're gonna have older classic games and stuff like that what
3739960	3743600	was this also something about like maybe it's not really running on your computer
3743600	3746820	it's running on someone else's computer a server you're looking like through a
3746820	3751520	window type of thing basically yes that's so strange to me yeah cuz game tab
3751520	3754360	you have to wait for stuff to download to your computer so I'm assuming it's a
3754360	3757480	little different there and this also they're gonna also have a kind of an
3757480	3763040	online game portal that's gonna be free as well on top of all this stuff it's
3763040	3769400	basically like a browser-based streaming device they're also gonna have like you
3769400	3774960	know free streaming of selection of demos as well so I guess the limited
3774960	3780680	number of full games for rent at for a per game fee without the monthly service
3780680	3785360	charge so kind of think of like what game tap did except not free you know
3785360	3794800	like their little free offerings I don't know it's it's interesting I just don't
3794800	3800000	know if I would really I would probably not use this I just don't play enough PC
3800000	3806040	games toy gak says if it runs on their computers I might be able to play modern
3806040	3809680	games again maybe that's I mean that's the whole like catch to this I think
3809680	3813600	that's yeah it's it's it's so it's kind of like having your PC as being a
3813600	3818640	console where she don't worry about your PC being up to spec to run these games
3818640	3824040	well you just have to have a fast enough internet connection and their PCs will
3824040	3829320	do the work for you interesting I'm really curious to see how this runs like
3829320	3832360	especially if it's if it's really that smooth because I would think I would
3832360	3835360	think that this would run into a similar problem is the whole Ubisoft thing is
3835360	3839760	that if your internet stops working the game stop working because how else are
3839760	3842720	you gonna get the data from the computer well yeah that's just goes with anything
3842720	3847640	as far as like streaming content goes you know you're on demand or anything if
3847640	3852800	your connections stops working then obviously yes it will shut off but
3852800	3857160	that's the same with like a phone call if your phone service goes out then your
3857160	3862880	phone call goes down but you know and I guess it would matter you know it would
3862880	3866880	be you have to make sure that your data center wherever that you're connecting
3866880	3870960	on live you know if their data center goes down or wherever nearby then yeah
3870960	3874480	you'd be kind of screwed chat let me pose this question to chat real quick is
3874480	3879400	on live something that interests you why or why not and I'll kind of ask the
3879400	3882200	folks the studio here the same question is on life something that interests you
3882200	3887360	why or why not logy no and the reason why is because I don't play a lot of PC
3887360	3890080	games anyways and a lot of the games that it seems like that they're gonna
3890080	3894120	have on here are also console crossovers which I would just play on a console on
3894120	3898760	my own time if I was doing that I don't see why honestly I don't have a lot of
3898760	3901600	time for games anyways nowadays and I only seem to be playing like one game
3901600	3907680	at a time I can't see myself paying $15 a month for this I'm gonna say no for
3907680	3912400	the same reasons that Loki said well I should I'm I'm interested like I'm
3912400	3917440	curious to see how it works in action but I think Loki hit the nail on the
3917440	3920840	head console crossovers most of this is already the stuff that's on consoles and
3920840	3924840	and I built my PC to run crisis so god damn it if I'm gonna play crisis it's
3924840	3929800	gonna be running on my PC Dark Sakura I don't know if this is something that
3929800	3933720	would interest you on live being able to have your low-end computer stream the
3933720	3942160	games I don't really care about that honestly you know if I'm gonna if I'm
3942160	3946520	gonna play my live games I'm just gonna sit down and play them on my Xbox kick
3946520	3952120	down off of Borderlands all right am I is something wrong with Chad I got
3952120	3956000	really quiet in there I'm a little worried chat orange launch radio.com
3956000	3958840	it's all the hallucinogens I piped through the internet keep in mind
3958840	3961760	there's also a delay so when I say something it takes like a minute just
3961760	3964880	because we encode to all games who encodes to the shout you know and
3964880	3967880	dah-dah-dah-dah so there's a little bit of a delay between when we say things
3967880	3971440	when they hit the chat room but finally we're getting some feedback here on act
3971440	3976880	deaf in our chat room says no because in Mexico if the service will even be
3976880	3979940	available here we don't have a really good connection speed it's gonna be
3979940	3985880	laggy as hell probably Bochi Kawa says interested but really I don't find it
3985880	3990680	worth it yeah I mean you know you're asking someone to pay an extra
3990680	3994400	subscription fee a month but it's it feels to me like that's the other thing
3994400	3997400	is paying for something that I could just go sit in the other room well you
3997400	4002920	still have to pay for games on the Xbox well yeah but pay more well how is it
4002920	4007240	different from a gamefly account I don't have a gameplay account I would think a
4007240	4011440	gamefly account would be the better option if you ask me granted you can't
4011440	4015600	stream a whole bunch of different games at a time but you got to ask yourself
4015600	4020480	really are you playing like 10 games at a time I mean are you gonna go on the
4020480	4023720	service and go hey you know what I'm gonna play 12 different games this month
4023720	4030080	I mean that's great to think that you might do that but in all reality you're
4030080	4034560	probably not gonna it's gonna be hard to keep track of what's going on in each
4034560	4038840	different game and I know you know back to the day I even then I still didn't
4038840	4042720	really play a ton of different games I'm usually playing one game to completion
4042720	4045760	or till I get tired of it and move on to something else you're not gonna see I'm
4045760	4049440	the opposite I'm gamer a DD all the way I play one thing and then what not
4049440	4053600	again what but like the fact that I'm playing Final Fantasy 13 two weeks in a
4053600	4058440	row pretty solidly is is really it's it's an event like if you listen to past
4058440	4062280	months of this show didn't go find another game that I have that much
4062280	4065600	attention you wouldn't feel lost if he didn't have like these other you know
4065600	4072920	options like I mean I I just don't see you know 40 or 50 games on there I guess
4072920	4079320	that would be a good value but it's just I wouldn't see myself using it a couple
4079320	4083360	of the quick thoughts here from our chat room alpha-kin anagram seems to think
4083360	4086800	that it's Pokemon that's distracting all our chatters tonight everybody's a busy
4086800	4090120	catching their mudkips and they're little they're little balls that they
4090120	4093600	run around with now because basically they took the walking trainer and
4093600	4097720	incorporated that into a Pokemon game am I correct mm-hmm okay thank you I used
4097720	4103120	to have the old it's like bringing back Tamagotchi I swear to God that thing
4103120	4106760	looks like a Tamagotchi remember the old Pokemon Pikachu things that you just
4106760	4110360	attached to your belt the pedometer thing that's what it is why no but
4110360	4114480	remember the old ones well they do it would to compete with Tamagotchis
4114480	4119440	essentially right like they're making all new again all you need to do is you
4119440	4124120	download one of those free Xbox 360 massagers plug in the fucking controller
4124120	4129160	into the duct tape that little Walker thing on there set it to vibrate at the
4129160	4132920	new high setting to before you know it you'll be good to go all right I'll
4132920	4137000	paint shaker but a couple other quick thoughts from our chat room on the on
4137000	4141840	live Akuma JP says yes if it is cheaper I would like to play games for my net
4141840	4147120	book net book is a good thought if it's a tune for net books net books could be
4147120	4152800	gaming devices very interesting IK ripper says maybe most likely no there
4152800	4156200	you go thoughts from our chat room chat dot orange on twitter.com speaking of
4156200	4160960	moving and pedometers and all that shit EA Sports active 2.0 is announced and
4160960	4165480	it's coming out for the Wii the ps3 and the iPhone oddly enough nothing said yet
4165480	4169440	on the 360 I can't believe though with project at all on the horizon they
4169440	4172800	aren't cooking something up for the 360 but my assumption is it's probably
4172800	4177840	different probably much different anyhow EA Sports active they are getting a
4177840	4181560	proper sequel not like a spin-off type thing like you've seen happen with the
4181560	4185120	first set I think they had like more exercises or whatever but a proper sequel
4185120	4188640	the console version of the game now they're gonna come with two motion
4188640	4194760	sensors and a heart rate monitor you strap on your arm and leg interesting
4194760	4200000	so it's gonna measure your heart rate now by the way you can share this
4200000	4203480	information over social networks online so I'm assuming you're gonna be able to
4203480	4208640	Facebook your EA active progress goody goody EA Vancouver is developing it one
4208640	4211800	other thing I noticed it looks like almost like a little USB thing that you
4211800	4214840	could like plug into your iPhone or something almost like a little dongle if
4214840	4219160	you will for your iPhone or of course iPod touch with that so very
4219160	4222800	interesting you want to know why it's not coming out on the 360 because 360
4222800	4227760	hasn't at all nope that's not why it's all right why 360 here's why one for the
4227760	4232400	heart rate monitor for the Wii you've got your stupid vitality sensor that it
4232400	4238760	will probably support to the Xbox 360 doesn't like Microsoft does not like
4238760	4246280	licensing out their wireless technology for any peripheral really they've done
4246280	4249640	it with you know the rock band guitars and the guitar hero guitars but that's
4249640	4258080	about it the wireless technology it mostly everything has to be wired so I
4258080	4261360	mean obviously since these devices are wireless you're not gonna be able to
4261360	4268000	create some sort of wired device to plug in with you know the Xbox 360 a little
4268000	4273280	USB shit could go in yeah but they don't do that kind of stuff that's why it's
4273280	4278720	it's different they have certain specifications at the meet also play
4278720	4284400	nice with each other I I still think you're I can't believe that you'll EA
4284400	4291720	is a big big backer of 360 it's gonna be the tall that's the that's why all
4291720	4296520	right anyhow I could be wrong but I'm probably not let's get into our classic
4296520	4300400	game of the week is where I get into the end of part a believe it or not and we
4300400	4304840	always like to end the first half of our show by taking a trip down memory lane
4304840	4309000	where dark soccer is going to visit one of our classic video games from
4309000	4313720	yesteryear the classic of the week dark Sakura what video game should all the
4313720	4317320	boys and girls out there be enjoying this week the game of the week is
4317320	4325800	grottiest to grottiest to and keep now I have to make a mention it is not the
4325800	4331800	grottiest to that is that we got out as nemesis to for the nest this is
4331800	4338840	grottiest to for the arcade and PC engine listen the music for a minute
4346920	4353320	yes if you play Konami series of music games you heard this remix before that
4353320	4358880	is where burning heat came from that's why when you're actually playing the
4358880	4363600	music you shoot you know it shows the the sun's with the little snakes coming
4363600	4369120	out of the you know the fire um grottiest to it was the gratitude to
4369120	4376240	the ambition of gopher it was it came out in 1988 in Japan and it was the
4376240	4380640	direct sequel to grottiest and the prequel to glad grottiest three of
4380640	4386600	course there were versions that came out for the Famicom the PC engine in the x68
4386600	4393280	thousand and it is it has been we released the PC engine version and
4393280	4399080	Famicom versions are out on the virtual console well not in North America until
4399080	4405080	it came out in grottiest collection that came out in 2006 and then the
4405080	4411760	international releases on the virtual console grottiest to came out in Europe
4411760	4416840	in the arcades under the name of Vulcan venture so yes more fun with the Vic
4416840	4426800	Viper and it did bring in some of the stuff that came from salamander or life
4426800	4431000	force as when the other names and also I'm sorry but I think it's really
4431000	4433400	important just basically reading chat it's really important to make this
4433400	4437560	distinction people think life force is grottiest too because of the way these
4437560	4440720	games were marketed to us as children is that a lot of us thought life force was
4440720	4444360	a secret audience but they're actually two separate series in Japan there was
4444360	4448800	salamander and it was grottiest we never got the actual grottiest too well not
4448800	4456000	back in the NES days we got it later which I'm sure nemesis too was was like
4456000	4461480	the life force grottiest and not guys life for salamander that's what that's
4461480	4464600	a bit just a very common whoopsie because you know and again when I was a
4464600	4467600	kid I thought life force with the sequel to grottiest because they look the same
4467600	4471040	they felt the same but two different Japanese series that are just very
4471040	4476280	similar well um one of the good things that came with this one is also the
4476280	4483240	first one that had the boss rush they had levels with there were only boss
4483240	4488080	confrontations so it's pretty cool so yeah you had you can pick your different
4488080	4494280	weapon system so that as you picked up power-ups you can choose which of your
4494280	4498240	different power-ups you could do like you could speed up you had options you
4498240	4506920	had missile double laser the ripple sucks by the way it always has now when
4506920	4511880	this came out on the Famicom it was one of the games that had a mapper chip to
4511880	4516920	increase the graphics and sound a lot of games in Japan had that the Nintendo
4516920	4523460	being big sticklers here in the US they actually had to have they a lot of you
4523460	4527040	know games were a lot better overseas because they couldn't bring them out
4527040	4534140	with anything other than the type the proprietary carts over here remember so
4534140	4539720	there was the PC engine version in 1992 that came out as a super CD-ROM which I
4539720	4547960	have a burn and one by the way one could argue that that's why this game never
4547960	4551800	came out in the u.s. is because the specialized car and why Konami instead
4551800	4556320	took the approach to kind of market life force as a sequel to Gradius basically
4556320	4562000	this is one of the games that I'm looking for a legit one by the way it is
4562000	4569120	just so awesome is so so if this has this is my favorite gradius game there's
4569120	4575480	also they added an additional stage though for the PC engine version that
4575480	4580200	came from the nest version of life force that was also the first stage of gradius
4580200	4585360	3 it also came out and for the gradius deluxe pack for PlayStation Saturn and
4585360	4592800	Windows in 96 and then came out worldwide gradius collection for the PSP
4592800	4604560	the of course the PC engine version was a Hanabi festival game in 2008 and of
4604560	4608540	course there's always sweet spots at every boss battle that's right that one
4608540	4616940	spot you got a hit to kill it fast and ripple does suck I agree alright there
4616940	4621320	it is your classic game of the week gradius 2 that little clip coming to you
4621320	4624880	from the PC engine but it's it was one reason to ever take the ripple lasers
4624880	4630880	because the progression afterwards had didn't have double yeah double was in
4630880	4635180	yeah I mean the one that came after ripple it was it was I think it was your
4635180	4639480	other option mm-hmm I know there was always a reason to take the ripple route
4639480	4644360	but you just always bypass ripple tiger glass a good question is a valid
4644360	4648600	question for Jack just gradius to have vertical stages no no that was unique to
4648600	4651840	the salamander series salamander that was part of what made that series unique
4651840	4656840	yeah it was vertical stages good question though again all that all the
4656840	4661240	marketing changes and stuff from Japan over here kind of screwed us up as a kid
4661240	4665120	you know when Final Fantasy 7 came out who didn't ask where the hell was fourth
4665120	4670480	through six I think I thought it was kind of cool they're like yeah we know I
4670480	4673680	think by then a lot of people have figured it out but you know all right
4673680	4677040	anyhow we're gonna take a break here at orange launch radio we got plenty more
4677040	4681840	coming up some quick news when we come back about DJ hero and Tron yes and
4681840	4686120	we'll see that trailer for the new Tron movie looks sweet but I got to say well
4686120	4690560	actually no I take it back the movie is probably gonna be ridiculous but the
4690560	4695160	score by Daft Punk sounds amazing just even based on that little trailer I saw
4695160	4705360	gotta say very cool all right um let's see also news on XNA and Nintendo and
4705360	4708760	another Hanabi festival coming up we're gonna get into all of that a little
4708760	4712280	later on in part B of our show so don't go anywhere we'll be right back with
4712280	4722760	more of orange lounge radio and welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio on
4722760	4727400	this Sunday night March 14th of 2010 that's right pie day hope you're
4727400	4730600	enjoying some pie we're not really having pie in studio which is a bit
4730600	4733880	surprising I'm kind of full though I had fast food on the way over to the show
4733880	4737440	driving back from San Francisco sadly I was I was in San Francisco but not a
4737440	4741320	game developers conference but you know I'm not a game developer and you know
4741320	4745440	you have to be one of the big media companies that's a magazine or whatever
4745440	4748480	to get in there but that's okay although I think I would find the topics
4748480	4752920	fascinating like you know I I kind of like the science of game development and
4752920	4756280	stuff you know I understand that it's not really a media event that's what
4756280	4759520	e3 is for so I'm not gonna be all butthurt I'm not going although I wish I
4759520	4764480	I wish I could have crashed some of the sweet parties try the move stuff out but
4764480	4768520	that's about it it's all gonna be at e3 in a couple months anyway yeah so I'm
4768520	4771880	not you know too worried about it I mean of course I don't even know if I'm going
4771880	4775440	to e3 this year I am definitely not going to do that out sorry to hear it it's
4775440	4780840	just you know it's it's a strain to try to go you know each year anyways and I
4780840	4785640	kind of I gotta take a day a year off I mean like last year remember we went it
4785640	4790320	was kind of like yeah this is cool I feel like there's really more I want to
4790320	4795640	see this year between the portal to the final has he 14 the move the Natal all
4795640	4800520	this stuff you know or whatever Xbox ends up naming their thing I all that
4800520	4803400	stuff I want to see this year so it seems like there's more to it in good
4803400	4809960	time I don't know it's just I don't know all right well let's get into some
4809960	4813280	rapid-fire news and then we're gonna get in some Twitter topics as well so you
4813280	4816240	just have a few more minutes to get your Twitter topics and we have a few porn
4816240	4821640	into the Twitter already at olr porn what pouring pouring I said it fast all
4821640	4826800	right Loki start us off with some quick news tonight well Activision surprised
4826800	4833520	us whoo they have new download content coming out to DJ hero unfortunately I
4833520	4838160	don't give a flying fuck about it and this is really sad I mean unless you're
4838160	4842120	a fan of you've been asking for it for for oh yes I've been asking for it I was
4842120	4845760	hoping that they would I don't know put out some good download content and
4845760	4850880	granted you know I guess if you like Eminem and jay-z you probably would have
4850880	4855720	bought the renegade edition I didn't so I didn't and therefore I'm not buying
4855720	4860120	this either but for the sake of reporting it I will tell you what three
4860120	4866600	mixes they have in there shake that mixed with show me what you got without
4866600	4874160	me mixed with encore and can I get a mix with lose yourself and I've I've watched
4874160	4880440	the the video previews of these and let me just say I'm about as excited about
4880440	4886280	these songs as I have been describing these songs to you it's seriously awful
4886280	4890360	really what you're more of a trance guy anyway I mean and yeah that's fine but I
4890360	4895320	even gave the last the extended mix pack whatever I gave that chance and I didn't
4895320	4900880	really check up I downloaded the David Guada stuff but I did I like that I have
4900880	4907200	not and maybe I'll go back to that but I like the other pack to the there was
4907200	4913160	there was a what was it gorillas and something oh the the honor all of me and
4913160	4917760	radio gaga yeah that's my favorite of the whole freaking gayest extended mix
4917760	4921960	yeah and that's in the that download mix is and there I think gorilla song was in
4921960	4926600	the other song in there but yeah I I have to me I realized Eminem jay-z they
4926600	4932520	sell bazillions of albums but I'm just not I'm like I don't mind I know
4932520	4935560	whatever not for me but I understand there's an audience for it I wouldn't
4935560	4939160	mind those songs like if there's an Eminem song mix with like you know Queen
4939160	4943000	or something like something different you know I'm like the stuff that was in
4943000	4948280	the game I don't really care for to our you know rap R&B songs mixed together
4948280	4954520	and the same time also it's just like really how long have I had to wait for
4954520	4960240	another download pack I'm sorry but this is kind of like you know an insult to me
4960240	4964280	it's just like yeah you know we're just gonna let you know that it's out there
4964280	4967760	and I have DJ here on my Twitter you know they're on my Twitter and stuff and
4967760	4972160	like you know putting these retweets for like stupid shit like artists going oh
4972160	4976840	my god DJ here it's so cool it's like seriously you know when the fuck are you
4976840	4981160	gonna download or add some more download content you support this stuff but then
4981160	4985640	again we're talking Activision here so you really I've just got to wait for
4985640	4991040	some sort of DJ game from harmonix or EA before I get that real download content
4991040	4995960	because I sure as hell I'm not gonna get it with Activision so what about scratch
4995960	5003320	the ultimate DJ yeah when's that coming out I haven't seen that yet well I think
5003320	5007720	it's coming out around the time dude Newcomb forever is coming out and never
5007720	5011520	anyways if you're interested in purchasing these they are available on
5011520	5018360	March 18th for $8 or 640 Microsoft points and the tracks will not be sold
5018360	5025000	separately so yeah however if you are on the Wii guess what you are in luck
5025000	5030760	because you get them for a dollar more that's right there sold as single
5030760	5036280	downloads for 300 300 we points and that's a total of $9 for each so guess
5036280	5043680	what you get to pay the Wii Premium okay I'm done there now what is kind of neat
5043680	5048040	is they're gonna be adding a new way to navigate PlayStation home apparently
5048040	5053160	it's kind of take of the cross-media bar and the way they're doing it is they're
5053160	5056200	gonna be able to go to different spaces like for example you can favorite
5056200	5062800	different spaces you like going to you can go to you know personal spaces you
5062800	5066160	know whatever it'll make a lot I forgot that came out this week it'll be a lot
5066160	5069360	quicker to like kind of bounce from one place to another without having to walk
5069360	5073080	aimlessly through and I do anything with the olr club yet which by the way is
5073080	5077400	full I keep getting requests for the club and unfortunately I'm limited 25
5077400	5080760	members and I keep get like I seriously get new requests to join the club like
5080760	5084240	every other day which I'm flattered and thank you all for wanting to join but
5084240	5087480	unfortunately it's full so until Sony will let us have like I don't know 50
5087480	5091360	people 100 people all your apps are just sitting there waiting to be approved
5091360	5095400	until like I'm not rejecting them I'm just not answering them it because I'm
5095400	5099800	hoping that one day Sony's gonna say hey we're gonna make clubs useful and I can
5099800	5104360	have 50 or 100 probably just they can't physically you know handle that many
5104360	5108520	people in one space at a time or in that close that's a bunch of ball because if
5108520	5111880	you go to the main space area you can see more than 25 people there at a time
5111880	5116960	no offense I just yeah but if that's Sony's line I claim bullshit yeah but
5116960	5121320	how many servers are running that one space or I don't know whatever they're
5121320	5125320	just not doing it but you know what I'm not going on home either so I this
5125320	5128560	doesn't mean anything to me as well yeah I wonder if there's gonna be a theme
5128560	5134800	going on here but let's find out this is kind of neat apparently people think
5134800	5138240	that you're gonna have the power of the ps3 in your pocket within three years
5138240	5146040	the group imagination technologies maker of the power of VR chips says that I
5146040	5150280	guess powers like you know smartphones like iPhones the Droid and whatnot they
5150280	5155440	said that they you'll have graphics comparable to ps3 in three years and the
5155440	5158520	reason is because they're designing the chips right now for that kind of stuff
5158520	5165000	apparently they're working with different new groups to license things
5165000	5171400	you know you know like Apple HTC whatnot they're saying that in three years
5171400	5174640	imagination says you're gonna have a ps3 in your pocket and it's not gonna be
5174640	5180120	running at 40 by 340 resolution that most smartphones have now but it's
5180120	5186920	actually gonna be like a 720p output via HDMI to a TV that would be something
5186920	5189880	that phone that outputs to a TV via HDMI
5189880	5200040	interesting and yeah they go into a lot more detail of course on different
5200040	5205000	technologies are out there and stuff but you can only imagine though that as you
5205000	5208400	know time goes on I mean the technology is just growing you know and at you
5208400	5213560	know geometric rate that of course I can imagine you know I was actually having
5213560	5220000	that kind of technology soon within like next five years well yeah that seems a
5220000	5224040	little aggressive seeing as if you go by the whole like Nintendo is is one off
5224040	5229520	from the you know consoles with their handhelds meaning that the DS is kind of
5229520	5233000	like a 64 just like the advance was kind of like a super Nintendo then the next
5233000	5236480	handheld for Nintendo will be kind of like a GameCube funny that you mentioned
5236480	5240080	that actually oh oh I have something they'll be for last-minute stories for
5240080	5243360	that I can cover it now if you why not yes please please don't make me wait
5243360	5248600	any longer I need to know I need to know I'm dying apparently there's a rumor
5248600	5252000	about ds2 of course there's always a rumor about you there's always some damn
5252000	5257240	remember um according to somebody sources within GDC I'm not gonna read
5257240	5260640	through the article to see who exactly is quoting here that it's in the
5260640	5263480	developers hands and apparently they're not having trouble developing for it
5263480	5268120	because it's basically a GameCube power wise and everyone knows how to develop
5268120	5271720	for a GameCube because they've been doing it for quite a while with both
5271720	5276120	well because the Wii is a GameCube too basically yes the little the thing is
5276120	5280880	you know it's gonna be interesting this is apparently the people are familiar
5280880	5284760	with the dev kit made it sound like there wasn't much learning curve on the
5284760	5289920	new system and that devs who worked on GameCube or Wii games will find it easy
5289920	5294120	to create with also they said that apparently the system has a built-in
5294120	5298480	accelerometer and two big higher resolution screens that are closer
5298480	5305000	together so that they can more easily be used as one screen and I guess the
5305000	5308480	biggest bit of news however is that the devs say that they'll be done with their
5308480	5313760	games by the end of 2010 meaning that we may see an announcement at e3 well
5313760	5316280	it's kind of something we've been thinking for a while it's gonna happen
5316280	5320960	yeah despite the DS IX L I told you if they could do the micro so close to the
5320960	5326720	DS they can do the XL and have ds2 out 83 despite all their responses to the
5326720	5329840	cause you know I like the idea of bringing the two screens closer together
5329840	5332880	to make one big screen I think that's kind of cool yeah I wonder if they're
5332880	5339000	both be tons of touch sensitive this time right yeah why not and by the way
5339000	5343680	just pro tip Nintendo if it's gonna run on like GameCube II type hardware f0 ok
5343680	5348440	thanks all right and just because it runs on GameCube type hardware does not
5348440	5352200	mean that I want to see fucking ports of every single GameCube game that you guys
5352200	5357000	put out okay do some new shit seriously well at least unless it's Wind Waker
5357000	5361600	Wind Waker I will accept the rest of them except every time zero I reject
5361600	5367480	them all all right and for the gods sake please you know maybe add some more
5367480	5370680	buttons to the face like an analog stick or something like that so that we can
5370680	5374440	actually play games in traditional sense seven these like remember remember they
5374440	5377720	used to have that like thumb stylus thing that you would have to strap to
5377720	5383320	your finger they came with yes yes I do what were yeah I know that you could use
5383320	5386720	that in the mario 64 game to kind of control it uh-huh yeah it didn't didn't
5386720	5390680	really work yeah all right anyhow let's go a little old-school let's go very
5390680	5394560	old-school Donkey Kong of course there's a whole movie made out of the Battle of
5394560	5398240	the Donkey Kong high scores the King of Kong remember that it was Billy Mitchell
5398240	5401880	Steve Weeby Ryan and good versus evil or whatever you however you want to look at
5401880	5405880	it well guess what the whole movie has just been made irrelevant because there
5405880	5411960	is a new king in town and it's neither it's a new guy who Hank Chien is his
5411960	5415640	name he's a plastic surgeon from New York he has beaten Billy Mitchell's
5415640	5418760	record Billy Mitchell by the way had one million fifty thousand two hundred
5418760	5423520	points built our Hank sorry Hank has scored one million sixty one thousand
5423520	5428920	seven hundred points officially verified by twin galaxies an original Donkey Kong
5428920	5433600	cabinet machine in New York is how he said it congrats to him now he can star
5433600	5439760	in the sequel after a leading his high score he was heard quoted saying suck it
5439760	5445760	bitch yeah a tape has just arrived at twin galaxies from Billy Mitchell believe
5445760	5451360	it or not or who was it that was saying that like the the other person's high
5451360	5456520	score was like false or something like that like there was one of the two guys
5456520	5459160	that were complaining people get really into I don't know I didn't watch the
5459160	5462440	you know when I watched the movie I was just like damn people really get into
5462440	5466120	this shit but then I'm like oh I host a podcast on the internet about video
5466120	5469520	games like well I want to hold the high score for something really stupid that
5469520	5474760	you know I want to be all pompous hey I remember when we went to classic gaming
5474760	5478520	Expo one year and they were doing like the official twin galaxies high score
5478520	5483600	for I think it was stampede on the 2,600 that I played stampede dude I think I
5483600	5487720	was like last place for the day I was so fucking terrible at stampede but the guy
5487720	5490760	was trying to give me tips and stuff and what he was saying made a lot of sense
5490760	5495200	but I was just like wow when I was a kid I didn't think about these games like
5495200	5498400	that like the tips and everything he was trying to give me like I was just like I
5498400	5504040	just tried to lasso the horse thingies anyhow hey Tron something else from my
5504040	5507800	childhood of course Tron legacy that trailer hit the internet this week and I
5507800	5513300	gotta say although I my expectation bar for Tron like legacy is very very low
5513300	5520600	because Tron wasn't really a good movie per se it was just as an awesome movies
5520600	5524760	what it was one of those things that you just you like it better because you're a
5524760	5531120	kid and you know just the technology it's cool it's cool cycles it's not so
5531120	5535960	much good it's just cool so Tron legacies coming out I gotta say despite
5535960	5538320	the fact that the expectation bar for the movies are very low you know I'm
5538320	5541760	gonna be seeing it opening day okay you know I'm gonna go just like many of you
5541760	5547840	the score by Daft Punk sounds awesome like what's a word that's better than
5547840	5553880	awesome more awesome awesomer super off more awesomer than a lot of game
5553880	5557200	soundtracks out there well anyhow there's another track tie into Tron
5557200	5561960	legacy going on it's called arcade aid apparently if you actually go into the
5561960	5566620	Flynn lives website you can get this this picture that references I guess
5566620	5570760	they say 56 different arcade games old-school arcade games like I see
5570760	5574080	burger time like there's a little burger with a clock so that's one of the oops
5574080	5578280	I gave one away sorry but I totally dig the space paranoid signs still on the
5578280	5583000	building it's very similar to like I've seen something similar in Rolling Stone
5583000	5587240	that like had all these different band names as a picture like somebody
5587240	5591240	smashing a pumpkin there get it all these things like that I already did all
5591240	5597880	these like for example Goldeneye Star Fox Sea Wolf I see Kongo Bongo there at
5597880	5601920	the bottom no that's actually Donkey Konga Frogger because it's a donkey and
5601920	5608400	classic game I know shadow Colossus Frogger outrun because it's an
5608400	5614940	outrunning huh funny spoil everything geez well that's what I do that one
5614940	5621680	right there is Bertie King it's a golf game time splitters bomber made sheet it
5621680	5627200	off a website in you know I actually figured thank you can thank me putting
5627200	5631360	together my main cabinet for being aware of all these different because a lot of
5631360	5635760	the stuff I have themes for my hyper spin stuff so you know the names became
5635760	5640400	familiar I actually did you can ask my co-worker because I sat there for the
5640400	5643840	first hour that day that it came out during the day and just working on that
5643840	5648200	SSJ 100 as she 100 Matt says it was a good B movie Tron that is that's a good
5648200	5651720	way of just finding it I like Tron for the same reason I like showgirls it's so
5651720	5658800	bad you are a horror darlin I love Tron actually good movie to me end of line
5658800	5662880	have you seen the game trailer for Tron legacy I have doesn't it remind you of
5662880	5668200	force unleashed hmm I wasn't thinking of it that way but yeah I just I love the
5668200	5671360	old-school Tron arcade game and that was awesome but of course it's one of those
5671360	5674080	things that's better left in my memory because I played on an Xbox Live I was
5674080	5678240	kind of like yeah well in Tron and disc of Tron are actually the bottom of that
5678240	5681880	page to they really yeah all right anyhow act F'd also says it was Empire
5681880	5684880	magazine that did that collage I'm thinking of it's probably been done a
5684880	5688160	couple times I want to say there's a movie one out there too yeah anyhow who

5812800	5818280	wondering thank you everyone who now you don't turned over my cat's poop so you
5818280	5822280	remember the game hotel dusk also I haven't talked about the tester on this
5822280	5825960	show in a few weeks which I have what I've watched every episode last week
5825960	5829920	you did talk about oh never mind then okay okay finish I just okay yes you
5829920	5838040	can remember hotel desk yes the company that made it sing is a to over 200
5838040	5846520	million in debt they also did another code they did town factory for little
5846520	5852240	king story and last window yeah we better buy some more of their copies of
5852240	5855840	again which is coming out at the end of this month because that was also by the
5855840	5862800	them I think they filed for bankruptcy on March 1st 200 million yen so we need
5862800	5867480	to sell 200 million copies of that game I know you can do it um the final new
5867480	5871560	character for Street Fighter 4 has been released and it's a big red dude covered
5871560	5876840	in oil wearing what looks like a hat made out of Legos on his head and he's a
5876840	5881760	grappler and he slides and he's a splashing oil everywhere this is
5881760	5887440	actually kind of sploogeworthy so I I gotta give props to Alan he recognized
5887440	5891000	what they were referencing he's a Turkish oil wrestler it's this big thing
5891000	5895880	in in other countries like of Turkey where they douse themselves in what
5895880	5900960	appears to be ky jelly type of substance and wrestle each other it is pretty
5900960	5906400	homorific but no homo I've I've heard of it it's just the the screen captures
5906400	5910040	like dude you're red Greco Roman normally what's that isn't that like
5910040	5914560	Greco Roman oh I don't know he told me it was he told me to google image search
5914560	5919440	Turkish oil wrestling and let's just say I got a lot of guys who didn't look
5919440	5929440	quite as bad as that guy okay not wearing a blue Lego hat also is it
5929440	5937560	Mullen you yeah well I know whatever um anyway the guy who makes fable yeah
5937560	5943520	really but basically saying that comparing natal and move he said well
5943520	5946520	move is a good step in the right direction but it's not as big as natal
5946520	5954680	and he's not biased or anything well says first-party developer for Microsoft
5954680	5958520	saying that that move is going to be more for the casual market and natal is
5958520	5965640	going to be more for the immersive gamer so fable 3 will blow your mind except it
5965640	5970680	won't to be exactly like the last two games but he'll claim that it like blows
5970680	5981960	your mind it blows you I I'm interested to see what what the natal Lincoln is
5981960	5987160	but they do say on that natal is not mandatory for fable 3 which I also like
5987160	5998040	I will allow you to slap a bitch Oh Loki what we do without you here at
5998040	6001400	orange lounge radio we would die that's what would happen we would die how about
6001400	6006160	some Twitter topics speaking of death no actually we have some good questions
6006160	6008320	tonight we have some really good questions on the Twitter twitter.com
6008320	6011960	slash olr I'm going to allow usually I don't allow more than one question a
6011960	6016720	person but M and Ziba has a couple good ones tonight so I will I will grant an
6016720	6022120	exception M and Ziba asking what is the deal with the chocobo what is the deal
6022120	6028560	with the chocobo in Final Fantasy 13 is there a use for it or is it just there
6028560	6032400	to look cute and to make it a Final Fantasy game I think it's a little bit
6032400	6036640	the second part it is there to look cute and make it a little more of a Final
6036640	6041720	Fantasy game because since there is no like world map type thing they had to
6041720	6045280	incorporate a chocobo I think another way one big bitch about the game by the
6045280	6048880	way is that there's no Final Fantasy victory music you never hear doo doo doo
6048880	6052760	doo doo doo doo doo you never hear that but there at least there's a chocobo um
6052760	6057440	I will say this though they do treat the chocobo as a character and I think
6057440	6060160	that's what makes this a little bit unique compared to the other Final Fantasy
6060160	6063640	games like you know if you go into the bio cards you know when you're looking
6063640	6067440	into data log which is like a memory bank section of the game so you can read
6067440	6071240	what's going on all the characters have their little profiles with the data log
6071240	6076320	the chocobo has his own entry so I don't know if maybe the chocobo becomes more
6076320	6080800	relevant later in the story but he's awfully cute I want a fat chocobo to
6080800	6084040	hold your items yeah it's all my items it'd be awesome if he has a playable
6084040	6089000	character later on all right and M&Z but since I'm allowing the second tweet
6089000	6093800	tonight says this should be the game for the sweet off the Swedish Armed Forces
6093800	6096300	the team test remember we were talking about the sweet off with one of our
6096300	6100960	callers last week well there's this I've never even heard of this we just got a
6100960	6106200	link here to the Swedish Armed Forces team test and I guess it's some type of
6106200	6110080	like online little ranking thing I'll have to look into this and see if it's
6110080	6112960	appropriate for the sweet off but I don't know like part of me is like the
6112960	6117720	sweet off should happen with like president cat or beat mania 2dx or
6117720	6122800	something a little more showish or olr match game I think I think we have to do
6122800	6126160	all our match game for the sweet off I think that's that's just mandatory but I
6126160	6130040	appreciate the suggestion don't get me wrong tiger claw links us I'm sorry it's
6130040	6134880	actually tiger call 305 on Twitter links us to a story on one up about ensemble
6134880	6138080	and pandemic talking about their company closures they're actually taking
6138080	6142400	responsibility and blaming themselves according to the one-up article Paul
6142400	6146280	Bettner he was an employee of ensemble studios for 12 years of course it was
6146280	6149760	shut down by Microsoft in 2008 he blamed their own internal crunch
6149760	6154040	culture saying quote the reality is that every single game we shipped took twice
6154040	6158360	as long as we said it was going to take and cost twice as much to make Microsoft
6158360	6161480	as a public company they answer to their shareholders and we were simply too
6161480	6166160	expensive kind of an interesting little article kind of um interesting to hear
6166160	6170520	folks taking responsibility for what happened but still kind of a it's a
6170520	6173840	rarity nowadays it is a rarity nowadays but still kind of a bummer by the way
6173840	6179200	when the show is bad it's never my fault always Loki's that means it's never my
6179200	6185040	fault either it's rarely notice it's sometimes but all right Nico Nico Chan
6185040	6189640	links us to a website I think this might be a I think this might be a website
6189640	6193120	plug I don't know but I'll read it Pokemon ro dotnet what do you think
6193120	6197720	about it it's like red blue made from Ragnarok online system and skills but
6197720	6202360	with a ton of customs Jamie apparently knows it yes and we'll play we'll play
6202360	6207840	we'll play a plus plus we'll play again they're there right now right now I
6207840	6214080	hardly have time to play anything but this I will when I when my brain works
6214080	6218040	and I have time gonna make some time gonna make some time in between killing
6218040	6224240	the Klingons and Gorn spazzinator PSN says okay since it's pie day here's a
6224240	6228920	random question pizza or pasta Boston cream see I get what he's doing there
6228920	6232680	because they call it pizza they don't really call it pizza pie here at least I
6232680	6239720	never hear that term but yeah I think it's less deep dish here yeah I do love
6239720	6244160	Boston cream pies but it's like I'll still always have pumpkins so I've got
6244160	6249560	to go for pizza like if you're asking me one pie versus all of pizza those more
6249560	6255860	of a cake I mean really it's it's it's a cake with a cream layer in it but you
6255860	6260360	still elect Boston cream over pizza no I really love Boston cream pie I had it
6260360	6266880	for breakfast last week let's say let's see Ryan Belknap is wishing us a happy
6266880	6270320	pie day but he's also trying to imitate a spammer I see what you're doing there
6270320	6276160	he's a Twitter folks it's SSJ 100 Matt on Twitter but his Twitter name is Matt
6276160	6281080	Ostrovsky which I always mispronounce dr. love himself Gene Simmons will be
6281080	6285640	voicing Guitar Hero 6 could it be Guitar Hero kiss awesome how this missed the
6285640	6288440	show world tonight but I remember reading about this apparently Gene
6288440	6291680	Simmons has said he's doing Guitar Hero but Gene Simmons also one of those guys
6291680	6295760	that I get the feeling might batter off about something what he really doesn't
6295760	6299120	know what he's talking about so like he might be saying he's doing Guitar Hero
6299120	6302160	six but I totally see like maybe there's a kiss Guitar Hero game in the works
6302160	6307040	it's not actually I could see him being the voice of Guitar Hero just because he
6307040	6311440	said he's the voice of Guitar Hero but here's the thing is he's also the voice
6311440	6318160	of I need to get paid because you know we're not putting out any new albums and
6318160	6322600	we are doing touring sometimes but you know what he's been on Celebrity
6322600	6329080	Apprentice he's had his own reality show he's you know he's horned himself out
6329080	6332920	okay that's really what it comes down to and and he was on the Celebrity
6332920	6336280	Apprentice for heaven's sakes I mean that's that's where celebrities go and
6336280	6339360	because they need attention and you know what cool he can be in the next Guitar
6339360	6343000	Hero game just don't be pissed off if he's singing Kelly Clarkson can't wait
6343000	6347680	can't wait for the youtubes of Gene Simmons singing Taylor Swift you belong
6347680	6356480	to me anyhow uh that was my Taylor Swift impression by the way or Lady Gaga or
6356480	6366120	something can't wait the full in the full makeup you belong to me yes Taylor
6366120	6371240	Swift sings like a muppet um lastly on the OLR Twitter brick tone asks us and I
6371240	6374640	this is kind of a fragmented question apparently he was challenged with 140
6374640	6379560	characters support for ps3 crash question mark well I don't support the
6379560	6386320	ps3 crash but you know mistakes happen I put it kind of on the same level as the
6386320	6391320	Red Ring of Death it's unnecessary Ubisoft online PC copy protection and
6391320	6394680	what do you think of the wiimote for ps3 well we talked about the PC thing a
6394680	6398080	little earlier and go listen to last week's show this way I wish the Red
6398080	6402240	Ring of Death was exactly like the PlayStation Network fail or the ps3
6402240	6406160	failures because if the Red Ring of Death would just go away after a day I
6406160	6410120	wouldn't be complaining as much of it oh well that's an inconvenience but I'll
6410120	6415920	just wait 24 hours and it'll be all better no that's not the case it happens
6415920	6420320	to all the consoles that's true I don't go after a day I would rather have the
6420320	6424560	24 hour shutdown than the you know permanent shutdown and lastly what do
6424560	6426920	you think of the wiimote for ps3 well again I think we talked about that a
6426920	6430160	little bit earlier in the show I think it's a necessary step for Sony but it's
6430160	6433640	an unnecessary peripheral for me to buy right now that's where I'm at until I
6433640	6439100	see that must-have game I'm not sold and I don't know what that must-have game is
6439100	6443240	but it's not like Sony can't create a new IP because like little big planet
6443240	6448720	hello that is like a system seller ps3 game is that good you know uncharted is
6448720	6452840	that good speaking of little big plant you did you see the video of like how
6452840	6458120	exactly the PlayStation move works in I'm gonna be honest no I just heard it
6458120	6463600	is compatible did it look good no it's basically you know how in Super Mario
6463600	6466840	Galaxy the other players control like a curse or whatever and they could shoot
6466840	6473960	shit no this one you basically control a cursor and you can move shit well yeah
6473960	6477880	it might add another element to level design and I'm all for it you know again
6477880	6482520	where I give major major props to media molecule and Sony is that they're not
6482520	6487280	milking little big planet for a two and three and four they keep making the
6487280	6491960	first game better and making it so much more of a value so it's hard to be mad
6491960	6496040	yeah you know what it's another feature it's just one I probably I'd like to
6496040	6500680	think of it as a continuous of all continuously evolving experience God I
6500680	6504040	wish games were like and you know what I think that they could do a little big
6504040	6508600	planet too but just release as a download pack look new levels that do
6508600	6513000	you think maybe just ModNation racers will probably have it too at some point
6513000	6516760	just wasn't ready to show yet like gripping the steering wheel wheel with
6516760	6522840	your you know not wiimote you know I'm sure it's an inevitable thanks for the
6522840	6526800	tweets guys twitter.com slash olr give us a follow we really appreciate it and
6526800	6530160	by the way I also wanted to say this at some point in the show tonight we really
6530160	6534180	do appreciate five-star reviews on iTunes and people that help spread the
6534180	6537920	word because you know we do say at the end of every show you know tell a friend
6537920	6540720	or two about the show and help spread the word about orange launch radio
6540720	6544800	that's really all we ask to continue doing this show for you guys and I just
6544800	6548920	want to say there were a couple of really really nice reviews left on
6548920	6552480	iTunes this week I wanted to read them because they were very very nice and
6552480	6557120	with last week's show even with last week's show these were both left in the
6557120	6561640	past week for a short and sweet one from Bert 777 saying I love it been listening
6561640	6565120	for a while anybody into video games give these awesome people a chance so
6565120	6569400	thank you Bert hope Ernie's doing well and but I want to read this one this is
6569400	6573360	just sweet this this gave me the awe feeling and and really makes doing the
6573360	6577040	show worthwhile shadow seven seven says I've been listening to OLR for at least
6577040	6580720	three years and over time they went from being a good podcast to an epic podcast
6580720	6584040	they are opinionated and well-informed on video game matters and to top it off
6584040	6587120	for really funny over time they have honed their broadcasting skills and
6587120	6590160	their radio voices and have become a podcast that I would actually pay money
6590160	6594520	to hear they do go off on tangents quite often though choo-choo this is a plus to
6594520	6598040	me but always managed to wrap something up about video games into the subject
6598040	6601000	they are always current about the video game industry and run the gamut on
6601000	6605960	topics from reviews to previews to info on various video game developers and
6605960	6609280	publishers to things random to describe the live show is something new
6609280	6611720	experience and they actually pay attention to the chat room and take
6611720	6615240	calls the community is also fairly active so I just want to say thank you
6615240	6619000	because you know people take the time out to write these nice reviews and I
6619000	6621720	realize yeah it's a little bit of ego stroking and so forth but I actually
6621720	6625320	read that it made me go oh that's really nice like somebody didn't have to say
6625320	6630600	all that and they did and I just wanted to share the the odds so thank you very
6630600	6635080	much again those are five-star reviews from iTunes and of course you know all
6635080	6638960	we ask I realize not everybody's on the Apple bandwagon like if I asked Loki to
6638960	6641960	leave a five-star review on iTunes he told me to play hide and go fuck myself
6641960	6646120	from last week's show so it just tell friends about the show that's all we I
6646120	6650000	don't go on iTunes I know you don't you know that's against you can rate them on
6650000	6656600	zoom to just you know all right anyhow let's move on some actual video gaming
6656600	6660360	news let's get past the ego stroking and get to some more video game news
6660360	6665680	because there's plenty of it still to go more stuff coming out from you know this
6665680	6670760	week there's actually some information you know we talked a little about in the
6670760	6678080	tall and whatnot but can't forget about XNA XNA game studio 4.0 apparently is
6678080	6684960	including support for Windows phones and they're even going to be including some
6684960	6691360	new features including gamer tags avatar support and achievements you can unlock
6691360	6697200	on your phone that's right there's going to be games that you can use for
6697200	6702280	unlocking achievements kind of like an Xbox Live arcade game in fact you can
6702280	6710080	unlock up to 200 Microsoft or gamerscore points and I guess it's going to be
6710080	6716440	displayed on your Xbox Live gamer tag profile like the games for Windows stuff
6716440	6721080	because there was that one game tinker was it called that you can only get on
6721080	6723400	the windows thing it was like the free game that came with the games for
6723400	6726440	Windows client and you could play that game I reviewed it about a month ago I
6726440	6729000	think it was called tinker and it would show up in your profile just like any
6729000	6731720	older the game and it had its own set of achievement points so it's kind of like
6731720	6736280	that but now on your cell phone yeah and it's kind of neat I think that's a cool
6736280	6740200	idea you know for you know how Apple should have done it achievement whores
6740200	6745840	they well you know sometimes achievements like that it gets people
6745840	6748960	to buy the game well there's a whole study out of GDC again it's not on the
6748960	6752360	show tonight but there's a whole thing on achievements and it does motivate
6752360	6756000	people to play games and there's a percentage of people it's a small
6756000	6759360	percentage but a percentage that really try to go after every single achievement
6759360	6763280	in a game you know and and we'll buy games with a chief didn't they say to
6763280	6768400	that games with really easy achievements especially in arcade will sell a little
6768400	6774640	more times me so hey why not if it's a way to draw attention to the windows
6774640	6778560	phone anything to pull the eyes away from Apple for a minute I I think is a
6778560	6784280	good idea mm-hmm all right with this would this get you on board with a
6784280	6787360	windows phone though Loki since I know you're not gonna get an iPhone no because
6787360	6791360	the data plans on phones are too expensive and it's just you know if they
6791360	6795960	brought down if it was like 50 bucks a month for unlimited data and everything
6795960	6799640	then maybe because that's what I kind of pay for my phone right now but even then
6799640	6802760	I don't use that many minutes right now and I'm actually thinking about going to
6802760	6807400	a prepaid phones where I don't have to you know like 100 bucks a year type
6807400	6815440	stuff you know we're literally I'm lucky if I use six to twelve minutes a month
6815440	6820160	well somebody is teasing me yet again with the idea of a new Kid Icarus game
6820160	6823220	remember about a year or two ago where we were convinced this was coming out at
6823220	6826880	e3 we had the screenshots and everything and it just didn't fucking happen how
6826880	6832040	sad well again we get teased and you can kind of thank Kotaku for that but really
6832040	6835640	it was because they were interviewing Yoshio Sakamoto who of course was one of
6835640	6840200	the creators of Kid Icarus I guess they cornered him at GDC or something and
6840200	6843600	basically he said in a nutshell that you know they're not opposed to bringing out
6843600	6846880	Kid Icarus to the Wii they just don't know what to do here's the quote quote I
6846880	6851520	don't know personally about any project underway regarding Kid Icarus but if so
6851520	6854320	many of these people are interested in it and really want to see it on the Wii
6854320	6860280	they should really speak up are they deaf because I think like a lot of
6860280	6863560	people have been like speaking up for a while but okay whatever well are we do
6863560	6868360	we need to do a petition online is that what needs to happen good gosh I'm sure
6868360	6873360	there's plenty already again moving on with a quote quote if we can find some
6873360	6877320	sort of way to bring it to the Wii a way to make the game for the Wii that makes
6877320	6882000	sense we would happily do so but just keep in mind it may not be me making the
6882000	6885720	game so in other words he's admitting it might be somebody else just like how
6885720	6889680	Metroid other M is is in somebody else's hands and so forth honestly I think if
6889680	6892600	they want to do a Kid Icarus game on the Wii why not just do like a souped up
6892600	6897460	version Allah even though even I hate to say it because I received this game so
6897460	6901160	tepidly but maybe the blaster master game just a little more polished or the
6901160	6905320	just like the Mario new Super Mario Brothers Wii you don't have to like
6905320	6911200	totally reinvent Kid Icarus just you know make it a fancy looking 2d game
6911200	6917440	with some new features that's all you really need to do I think but all right
6917440	6921440	I just hate the idea that's getting teased on that again because I would
6921440	6924800	really love to see a Kid Icarus but again I want to see him do it right I
6924800	6927600	don't want to see him just slap something with the character his name on
6927600	6931480	it and it sucks so I rather they just don't touch it at all and I'm sure a lot
6931480	6934860	of you guys feel the same way anyhow dark soccer what you got I want the most
6934860	6940120	epic Kid Icarus ever I do too I you know and especially you would think with God
6940120	6944400	of War which is another Greek mythology thing doing very well on another
6944400	6948120	platform you think Nintendo would would already have some ideas on how you can
6948120	6951760	make the Greek mythology thing successful I know how about Battle of
6951760	6957240	Olympus anyone well how about something else though that is kind of a big ish
6957240	6967560	okay Hanabi festival yay but Nintendo raised some prices for some of their
6967560	6972680	games ironclad is now a thousand we points instead of 900 and loadrunner is
6972680	6980000	600 instead of 500 there's military madness for we wear which will be a
6980000	6986600	thousand we points and then the rest is DSI where pop island simply mahjong
6986600	6996160	simply sudoku each of those will be 200 DSI points and then four travelers play
6996160	7000480	Spanish which is a multiplayer game that teaches you Spanish and elementary
7000480	7010320	masters being a fantasy card adventure both are 800 DSI points so they got a
7010320	7013920	lot of the big stuff out last year but of course Rondo of blood is kind of the
7013920	7018840	big one that everybody's like that means I don't have to worry about
7018840	7021920	accidentally scratching my desk I wonder if that means it's gonna come out here
7021920	7025160	too oh I know you're reading it for Europe and what they get but they
7025160	7028400	sometimes get cooler stuff than we do so I hope it means we're gonna get it
7028400	7034240	around the same time want it might be dark sakura it could be tomorrow it
7034240	7040560	could be tomorrow I know I know I want next week to be here already not just
7040560	7043360	because of packs not not this coming week but the week after not just because
7043360	7046920	the PAX East but Microsoft Game Room I've seen some of the clips from my GDC
7046920	7050680	for Microsoft Game Room looks looks kind of cool I'm excited to try here's my
7050680	7054040	question though about that hobby festival those just because you guys
7054040	7058280	are getting all excited and everything one of the years they did bring that
7058280	7063720	stuff over here but not last year I don't think it was only in Europe well
7063720	7067620	it seems like they don't bring all the games over here cuz well no I guess they
7067620	7071800	did do a festival out of it because I want to say they brought sin and
7071800	7074960	punishment over here which was a big deal because they in the back of their
7074960	7078740	minds they knew the sequel was coming we didn't know that yet but they knew it
7078740	7085560	was so they brought that out yeah I think marbles too did also like yeah I
7085560	7089240	think you're right the original Mario 2 you're right yeah was part of that
7089240	7094400	crap well maybe they'll do it again here but not gonna hold my breath either so
7094400	7097200	we'll see a couple more stories for you guys then we're gonna get to the mailbag
7097200	7102960	mailbag at orange lounge radio.com well this is kind of an interesting tie-in
7102960	7109480	but apparently mafia 2 will feature vintage playboys that's right 2k games
7109480	7112440	has announced that they've signed a license agreement with the Playboy
7112440	7120400	magazine for I guess they're gonna have 50 of the vintage covers and centerfolds
7120400	7124440	inside the game when it's released so I guess you'll see vintage playboys
7124440	7131000	littered on the ground and stuff like that also I guess you know the Playboy
7131000	7135960	collectibles won't show up I guess until the later part of the game because I
7135960	7142520	guess the game takes place during the 40s and 50s and apparently the magazine
7142520	7148040	won't I guess merely be like a window dressing they're saying but I actually
7148040	7152720	have the ability to collect virtual copies of the magazine so that's a
7152720	7158160	Pokemon game worth playing so I guess you know like in the Grand Theft Auto
7158160	7161960	games where you have hidden packages or in you know Grand Theft Auto 4 birds you have to
7161960	7168160	kill this game you will have dirty magazines that you collect nice and
7168160	7172680	they're that are they actual Playboy vintage covers that's gonna be the
7172680	7177240	actual covers Wow so they're gonna I don't know if they have it says they
7177240	7179800	have the centerfolds as well so I don't know if you get the cover in the
7179800	7185720	centerfold it's a little bit of nudity for you but uh neat hey adding some tits
7185720	7188640	to your game always makes it sell a few more copies so there you go and I do
7188640	7193880	believe that they had a character from mafia 2 in the last digital fake game
7193880	7198640	chick oh they still do that huh yeah these girls and it's retarded yeah a
7198640	7205240	little silly all right on the PSP maybe this system can render some nice-looking
7205240	7209120	titties I don't know that should be the question we ask about a new engine you
7209120	7212480	know how we always say with a new peripheral what's the time to penis with
7212480	7215680	new game engines we should always ask what's the time for realistic boobs I
7215680	7220280	don't know anyhow I think this system is very capable of doing it it's the fire
7220280	7226080	engine that's phyre engine right now this is a tool that's used for creating
7226080	7231080	ps3 games it was used to make critter crunch flower shatter well apparently
7231080	7235280	now this is going to be compatible with the PSP big announcement a game
7235280	7238440	developers conference which makes sense because the people developing games want
7238440	7241200	to know that they can make games like critter crunch on the PSP I gotta say
7241200	7245760	flower awesome-looking game that is one of the most beautiful games you will
7245760	7250560	play on a next-gen system period critter crunch looks like a freaking cartoon
7250560	7253760	really well done so it's kind of exciting to hear that this phyre engine
7253760	7259760	is coming to the PSP one of the VPS technology taji you kata or sorry you
7259760	7263720	taka said phyre engine for PSP was developed in response to requests from
7263720	7267200	the game developer community and we hope that the release of the PSP version
7267200	7271280	demonstrates our commitment and support for game developers on all platforms
7271280	7276040	begin counting down the time until critter crunch and flower are announced
7276040	7280400	on the PSP because I'll bet you anything both of those games being as well
7280400	7285920	received as they were getting PSP ports in a matter of three two one yeah wait
7285920	7291720	for e3 anyhow now is the part of the show where dark soccer is gonna take an
7291720	7295120	adventure into the mailbag she's gonna jump in pull out some emails and read
7295120	7302720	them for you here the mailbag mailbag at orange lounge radio.com dark soccer who's
7302720	7308560	emailing us this week two from Rob above this is now that the following terms are
7308560	7312600	allowed in Xbox Live gamer tags lesbian gay bi transgender straight I think that
7312600	7317000	Microsoft has the golden opportunity for avatar clothing and props of the LGBT
7317000	7322200	it's not an official 2010 prediction but I'm pretty sure they will any takers or
7322200	7326080	am I taking too much for granted in other news did you hear about Washington
7326080	7329520	DC has made gay marriage legal next thing you know some guy will try to
7329520	7335400	marry his virtual girlfriend oh wait yes I I did hear about DC making it legal so
7335400	7339600	congratulations DC and I may I made a mistake because I tweeted about it when
7339600	7343360	it happens and I was like what state's gonna be next come on guys it's time to
7343360	7346320	get the other states on board and then I realized like literally five seconds
7346320	7351440	after hitting submit I was like oh DC is not a state but still it's it's an
7351440	7355800	important part of the nation obviously and very glad to hear that they have
7355800	7360640	stopped marriage discrimination yep good for them as far as the other part of
7360640	7364400	that the the part related to gaming more about how long before I can get a rainbow
7364400	7369480	sticker a rainbow belt for my character I don't know I think a lot of it is
7369480	7373960	about supply and demand and I don't know if there's just a huge demand for that I
7373960	7377680	don't think that Microsoft's gonna be really trying to sell that anytime soon
7377680	7381040	I don't know I think it would be a little while I just don't think there's
7381040	7385560	enough out there in the avatar marketplace where they need that stuff
7385560	7389800	right now I mean yeah they have sports jerseys but you know I don't know I
7389800	7394160	don't then again they had the politically motivated icons a couple
7394160	7397760	years ago when the oh eight election happened I want to say they had their
7397760	7402480	own little like Xbox poll because there were Obama icons and McCain icons right
7402480	7406520	am I crazy when there's some type of like unscientific poll they did like
7406520	7411880	yeah I don't know I don't know if they'd want to do such a social issue on the
7411880	7417800	marketplace I don't realistically see that happening well now also from the
7417800	7424000	Disney parks log the monorails are going to feature Tron legacy art okay that's
7424000	7428720	pretty cool nice like all the Disney parks are gonna be Tron Trana time
7428720	7433680	trying to tie looking at the Disney parks it's the it's Disney world oh wow
7433680	7438320	that's so cool you see the monorails at Disneyland like just got redone not that
7438320	7441920	long ago so I'm but I can't believe tell me this picture is not sweet oh that's
7441920	7444760	right oh it's just like a little paint job on the outside yeah pretty cool
7444760	7449320	though um yes me you know what I mean even cooler if they did
7449320	7455760	we know be boy no but seriously though speaking of Tron in Disneyland because I
7455760	7459800	can bring this back on point the coolest fucking ride I remember from when I was
7459800	7465080	a kid the people mover featuring Tron it was you know they had the people mover
7465080	7467800	which I had for years and years but in the early 80s when the movie came out
7467800	7471840	there was a section of it that was the super speed tunnel where basically they
7471840	7476320	projected imageries of Tron really fast on the wall so if it was a visual trick
7476320	7479200	it was an optical illusion that made you feel like you were going like 60 miles
7479200	7482600	an hour in this tunnel because it was like the light cycles going by real
7482600	7487840	quick like bring that back Disneyland the fucking tracks are still sitting
7487840	7493600	there not being used how awesome would it be if this Christmas you open it up
7493600	7499200	for Tron problem is the people mover someone fell off of it and died then
7499200	7503400	they their own damn fault and then they I understand yes and I totally agree
7503400	7506880	with you it is their own damn fault that they fell out of the stupid thing and
7506880	7511960	died then there was the rocket rods which were really super fast still had
7511960	7515920	the Tron tunnel but it was like zoom through the Tron tunnel it is hard to
7515920	7522440	see anything I never rode rocket rods sadly but someone also somehow managed
7522440	7528000	to fall out of that thing and died so people are dumb that's what it comes
7528000	7531040	down to that's why they all the gondolas anymore because someone fell out of it
7531040	7536600	and died it's always people acting like jackasses falling out of things and
7536600	7541840	dying the chat room has a request for me real quick here honors like a genuine
7541840	7547080	bona fide electrified six-car monorail what I say monorail what's it called
7547080	7555440	that's right monorail I hear those things are awfully loud it lies as
7555440	7559880	softly as a cloud is there a chance the truck could bend not on your life my
7559880	7565200	Hindu friend what about a spring that slobs you'll be given cushy jobs where

7608200	7615960	yes hopefully they involve monorails good morning orange house radio this is
7615960	7619880	Jesus writing in again I have quite a few things to cover today so first I'd
7619880	7622600	like to thank dark soccer for reading my previous selling email in this one as
7622600	7625920	well I really appreciate it I am also sorry for any spelling errors or
7625920	7629200	grammatical faults in my letters which there are undoubtedly many yeah but
7629200	7631880	you're forgiven now on to more pressing matters
7631880	7638120	okay ripper is the Swede I should be the other Swede since I am still just a
7638120	7643280	private in the ol army oh don't give up like that come on where's my epic battle
7643280	7649080	where's my sweet throw down okay fine a lot of respect goes out to a key
7649080	7652640	ripper his ability to call in so often I'm still quite impressed he manages to
7652640	7657480	stay up for so long every week anyways time for something that actually relates
7657480	7662360	to gaming as we all know the world is in a state of economic turmoil hundreds and
7662360	7666440	thousands of developers are being fired studios are getting shut down and the
7666440	7670040	debate of piracy and DRM is getting more attention around the globe as we've
7670040	7675560	heard on the last few shows but how is this impact impacting the gaming world
7675560	7680600	on a larger scale I'll tell you how more sequels than ever are being pumped out
7680600	7683440	in fear of bankruptcy and less money is being invested in creating new
7683440	7687080	intellectual properties the reasoning is very simple and is often employed in the
7687080	7690960	movie business using a successful brand name or franchise that is already well
7690960	7694720	known will cost the publisher a lot less money to build up interest and then
7694720	7698500	having to actually produce several ads and build a hype behind a new setting
7698500	7703120	and new characters successful games usually have an amount of blind
7703120	7706960	followers who will buy the next game in a series if the previous game was good
7706960	7710720	which in turn means almost guaranteed turnover of all investments and profits
7710720	7714800	for the publisher to prove my point I want each OLR member to try and think of
7714800	7721760	the game that is near release that is based on a new IP now that might not
7721760	7725560	have been too hard since you have had the new releases segments before mailbag
7725560	7731280	but my point is that a large percentage of new games have to have a two or three
7731280	7735800	in the name when will we get the next portal or Bioshock type of game that
7735800	7740600	comes along and really blows people's minds one portal to talk to I know right
7740600	7744840	what made both of those games so amazing was that there was no expectation of
7744840	7747800	what the games would be about the storytelling and both these were
7747800	7752320	innovated the protagonist intriguing in the setting unique which really made for
7752320	7756680	a game experience like no other with this in mind isn't it sad that there is
7756680	7761160	a Bioshock 2 already out in that portal 2 is on its way how we really reached
7761160	7766200	solo that any new franchise gets 80 or more Metacritic score gets placed on the
7766200	7770440	sequel bandwagon is this really what us gamers want I will have to say I am
7770440	7775480	excited about portal 2 I guess I'm just point though yeah well I know I get the
7775480	7780400	point but I do want more portal goodness I think though that some of us are just
7780400	7784600	like we have such awesome experiences with some of these games that we want
7784600	7788800	more it's a matter of whether they need to make the sequel or not like some
7788800	7793120	sequels are actually pretty good and some sequels are just kind of we put it
7793120	7796320	out because we want more money I have been hearing the most friendly feedback
7796320	7800200	regarding Bioshock 2 that a lot of folks are complaining it does feel like a cash
7800200	7804280	cow at the first game Bioshock was great but there have been some really good
7804280	7808600	original game a little big plan I was talking about earlier Bayonetta Bayonetta
7808600	7811600	was really well or the original Mass Effect I'm saying for sequels though oh
7811600	7814900	but I mean even original IPs there's been a lot of really good ones in the
7814900	7819280	past year blur looks like it's gonna be great you know there there's some
7819280	7826720	second to to finish email out I guess I'm just ranting at this point so I will
7826720	7830140	ask another question regarding new IPs when do you think Blizzard will release
7830140	7835160	a game with a new IP soon I think they're working on one right now I think
7835160	7839440	I I don't know maybe I'm putting the cart before a horse a little bit but I
7839440	7842520	remember there were some rumors a while back that they were working on a new IP
7842520	7848200	because they had Diablo Starcraft World of Warcraft and then another one I think
7848200	7852760	once you see the spacecraft I think once you see the dust settle with
7852760	7858940	Star Trek Star Trek Starcraft and the World of Warcraft cataclysm and you know
7858940	7863160	Diablo 3 is kind of their focus I think you'll start to get some rumblings of
7863160	7868440	what they're doing next and I my gut tells me it's gonna be an MMO and I'll
7868440	7872080	go so far to say it's an MMO but not like a Warcraft MMO like something
7872080	7877160	kind of different like a tabula rasa MMO you know how tabula rasa was like a
7877160	7881120	shooter like I think they're gonna go a different route with the MMO why make a
7881120	7884560	copy of Warcraft when they have Warcraft I think they're gonna go with an MMO
7884560	7892840	that's different and that makes sense well um okay looking forward to to the
7892840	7896480	show and your response is Jesus PS I will most likely be listening live to
7896480	7902000	the next olr the one on March 21st call us yeah we need maybe we should have
7902000	7904680	our match came off that week I don't know we'll see we maybe I could plan a
7904680	7908160	match game oh you're not gonna be here next no I'll be here I'll be late oh
7908160	7912360	you'll be late okay I'm gonna go to a Seder okay so well then what time do you
7912360	7916600	get back from those about seven eight maybe earlier all right cool then we
7916600	7920800	should be able to do a match game in part B yeah hello olr okay here's the
7920800	7923760	deal about a month ago I wrote in about Silent Hill shattered memories in Dark
7923760	7928560	Sakura the kind living woman she is I know told me flat-out to play one of the
7928560	7932720	originals now I'm getting to my point here I bought Silent Hill 2 just a
7932720	7937560	couple of days ago but I could have gotten a Silent Hill for the room so I
7937560	7940560	was wondering did I pass up a great game for a load of crap are they both equally
7940560	7944280	good and should I just shut the hell up now um they're different kinds of good
7944280	7948320	Silent Hill 4 is a very different kind of game sorry what was the other game I
7948320	7952720	heard the room it got Silent Hill 2 but passed up Silent Hill 4 to get it I
7952720	7957080	think you made the good choice I think yeah if you haven't played either I
7957080	7960120	think you made the better choice with two I think two is the one that's very
7960120	7963960	iconic of the series although a lot of folks are partial to three and the
7963960	7969040	original as well I personally am partial to three and I still say play two first
7969040	7973720	between the yeah I mean four is not bad by any means I think it got raised a
7973720	7977560	little bit by critics too harsh I think it's better than that but I think also
7977560	7980760	it's a little obvious that four was intended to be a different game in the
7980760	7986840	beginning yeah it because as far as how they're related three is more of a sequel
7986840	7993560	to one and four follow some of the story points from two well four was just gonna
7993560	7997500	be the room yeah it was a new horror franchise they were doing called the
7997500	8001040	room and they ended up you know it's kind of Silent Hill ish so let's make it
8001040	8006640	Silent Hill but it worked it really did work it did it it was a good game I a
8006640	8011060	horrible horribly underrated by the community at home the part with big head
8011060	8015440	good oh my god I screamed like a little girl when I played that I think Logie
8015440	8019120	was there and I felt I remember falling down and there were these big monster
8019120	8022760	two-headed baby things in the well water prison or whatever and I screamed like a
8022760	8025960	girl look he's what the hell are you doing like I'm playing Silent Hill and
8025960	8032600	it's Gary um okay so yeah they're both equally good but you did a good thing by
8032600	8037360	buying Silent Hill 2 on another note my friend brought up a good point today
8037360	8041120	about Max Payne 3 which brings me to another question do you guys know
8041120	8044080	whether or not they're going to bring back the comic panels for cutscenes are
8044080	8049960	we all fucked for that well I think I don't know yeah a little little early to
8049960	8054640	tell honestly but hey you could always have the digital comics on PSP you never
8054640	8058020	know they may make a comic out of it specifically for a PSP it would
8058020	8061840	certainly lend itself well to that well I thank you for reading my email and if
8061840	8066440	you didn't why the fuck not your loyal listener I'll just say I'm not gonna do
8066440	8070280	your whole name Haseo from northern Minnesota the land of the oh my god it's
8070280	8074840	so fucking windy I'm sorry muddy sorry I like listeners to get a little bit of
8074840	8079960	attitude with us and if you didn't read this email why the fuck no I like emails
8079960	8086440	to get a little sassy with us oh we got another did he text us really quick yeah
8086440	8092960	okay okay one more message is there a way to get memory from a ps2 I guess
8092960	8098620	memory card to a ps1 I can't because those are a bitch to find without going
8098620	8107200	online to PSP and onto a ps3 without the memory card adapter onto a ps3 no I
8107200	8112320	think you need the adapter if you're going from ps1 to ps2 a ps2 will read
8112320	8118300	the cards from one and you can even put that data on a ps2 card but only ask
8118300	8124360	like a carrier you can't put a ps2 card in a ps1 under any reason so the only
8124360	8128020	thing you could do you could put a ps1 card in a ps2 but unfortunately I ain't
8128020	8133000	gonna do you a lick of good without the the transmitter cable unfortunately
8133000	8138720	that's just the way it is oopsies if you I you might be able to I don't know if
8138720	8141400	this will work you might have to do some research on this you might be able to
8141400	8145540	get something that lets you put your ps1 data on the PC and then you could use a
8145540	8151440	USB stick to do it that I think is possible but I can't remember yeah but
8151440	8155920	saves on the PC had different formats and stuff so it might not work hmm
8155920	8159400	because remember there's like dextra I formats and stuff I know this from back
8159400	8164040	in the day when I'd used to do edit heck you'll just you might have to spend the
8164040	8168760	money to get the cable dude sorry all right well let's get into some angst
8168760	8172440	sometimes there are things that happen in the world that make us angry and we
8172440	8176060	always do this segment every week to just just get it out of our system so we
8176060	8198680	can be the happy host you know I was really trying to think of one okay this
8198680	8203900	is gonna require some backstory and it is a little bit of family goings-on for
8203900	8214220	me my my brother's girlfriend and her mother were found dead on Monday in
8214220	8221280	Silver Hill Alabama so if anyone in the area who knows them don't you know say
8221280	8228260	you heard anything well I mean I just it's not I guess so much of a fuck you
8228260	8235680	type of thing it's just more of a regrettable thing I actually have to say
8235680	8240800	everyone and Nina they actually don't know if it the whole theory is that it's
8240800	8244960	carbon monoxide poisoning what killed them in there and at the mobile home
8244960	8251240	they lived in because the last anyone heard anything was Friday and Matt
8251240	8255260	didn't find out no one found out until Monday when they found them but I'm just
8255260	8260960	saying there's no excuse not to have a carbon monoxide tester even if that
8260960	8263920	wasn't the cause that it's inconclusive right now they're treating it as a
8263920	8268880	homicide but even so if it was carbon monoxide or some type of gas monitoring
8268880	8272420	or anything there really shouldn't be any excuse if there's not a way to
8272420	8277720	monitor that I'd say everyone your your homes and your health and your lives are
8277720	8281960	that important you should invest a little bit monitoring don't they sell
8281960	8285480	and if they don't why not smoke detectors that double as carbon monoxide
8285480	8289280	they do it's a good thing to have you know how they regulate smoke detectors
8289280	8294120	in public they should be regulating the multi detectors people with smoke in the
8294120	8300520	house they turn off smoke detectors I know I know I know it's and you know
8300520	8306520	especially a lot of the manufacturing with some it was some of those mobile
8306520	8311400	homes are not always up to standard it's always very important that they be
8311400	8319480	checked out you know is I mean my brother's girlfriend she was 18 and her
8319480	8326200	mom was in her 50s and both way too young to you know well it's very
8326200	8332400	unfortunate I'm sorry to hear it yeah and and not my brother Matthew he's was
8332400	8335320	a bit of a mess when I talked to him but he seems to be doing better well yeah I
8335320	8340940	would be too so can't blame him so let that tragedy be awareness for everybody
8340940	8344660	it's no joke just like you know unfortunately I had a tragedy where I
8344660	8348500	lost someone h1n1 last year it's no joke some of these things you're about no
8348500	8353840	joke all right Loki your refuse the week we're in need a dick and fart joke to

8504920	8509320	um my f you I'll try to keep a brief I I've had to make a very tough decision
8509320	8513880	over the weekend and so you know like with any decision you have those two
8513880	8516760	guys that sit on your shoulder not necessarily the angel and the devil but
8516760	8520800	the you know advocate and for one side the advocate for other that yell and
8520800	8524760	argue back and forth so although I'm fairly confident in this decision I'm
8524760	8529680	about to make I say f you to the the guy that sits on my shoulder saying are you
8529680	8536920	sure are you sure we could get you a big boozy to shoot him with but then I would
8536920	8540160	shoot myself there's a how I feel about guns you're saying an F you to the
8540160	8549000	grant the granny questions do you wish to save are you sure is that your final
8549000	8554160	answer if you to Regis Philbin for making that a pop culture thing if you
8554160	8559360	Regis all right couple more news stories for you guys and then like it or not the
8559360	8563720	skyline will be open one eight seven seven game olr because it is the show
8563720	8568880	where every gamer has a voice Loki Activision and Fendi Ward are asking
8568880	8573320	you do you suffer from apathy that's right they're playing on releasing the
8573320	8579800	first map pack for modern warfare 2 becoming tax box live on March 30th no
8579800	8584680	word yet when PlayStation 3 will be getting it but apparently it's gonna be
8584680	8589960	a timed exclusive type of thing what will the map pack include well it will
8589960	8596440	include a couple new maps some that are to call I guess two of them are quality
8596440	8604040	for modern warfare 1 remakes also apparently there's gonna be let's see
8604040	8609120	here some other ones including a bailout which is a multi-level apartment complex
8609120	8614720	that sounds kind of cool storm and open industrial park littered with heavy
8614720	8621200	machinery salvages snowy junkyard fortified with stacked debris and crushed
8621200	8625760	cars and I guess two of the maps that are getting remade from called before
8625760	8630880	include crash which is against a war-torn urban environment and overgrown
8630880	8642280	which is a massive dry creek bed kind of neat all right lots of fun modern
8642280	8647000	warfare developments there I'm hoping actually none of those map packs I see
8647000	8651520	the heads of infinity more say where the was the content designed before the
8651520	8655840	heads of infinity Ward were axed I'm assuming no it's kind of funny they're
8655840	8663120	all you gotta love the the name of the download content is the stimulus package
8663120	8669440	is if that's not a slap in the face I don't know what is oh did you and they
8669440	8673800	should have called it infinity Ward you know I didn't realize this because I
8673800	8677360	don't really play games like modern warfare I mean not that they're bad
8677360	8681520	they're just games I don't really play I had heard that the credits in that game
8681520	8685320	are kind of funny because like all the studio credits you know they scroll by
8685320	8688160	or whatever then when it gets to the credits for Activision it speeds up and
8688160	8692080	they run by like eight times as fast and then it goes back to normal like there's
8692080	8695760	always that tongue-in-cheek we don't like Activision thing going on those
8695760	8700440	games I heard that on another show I thought that was funny all right uh
8700440	8705680	let's how about some news on monkey Island monkey Island is coming to PSN
8705680	8712160	Mac telltale and instant action I guess let's see the game store of course
8712160	8716160	instant action calm would be the other thing we're talking about there it's the
8716160	8720760	special edition of the secret of monkey Island and it's coming out that's pretty
8720760	8724520	cool though I think a lot of people have been waiting for it on PSN and of course
8724520	8729760	the Mac so there you go the island is sweet mm-hmm and by the way the sequel
8729760	8735760	the secret of monkey Island to even more sweet coming out on Xbox Live Arcade PSN
8735760	8740920	PC and the iPhone though the ending is really strange well there it is the
8740920	8745000	secret of monkey Island to coming out this summer on all those systems so it's
8745000	8749960	not quite the special edition just so you know it's just some new controls on
8749960	8758120	the classic game but still still what a good what a good game good times all
8758120	8762160	right I guess that's it for now should we try to open up the Skype line and
8762160	8767680	take some calls sure all right wide up one eight seven seven game olr our
8767680	8772840	username on Skype is orange lounge radio Skype line is open for business while we
8772840	8775440	wait for some calls because it takes about a minute for the chatters to get
8775440	8778080	the message Loki have any last-minute stories for us or I don't know dark
8778080	8785520	soccer you have anything okay then Loki I'm sure I do and I'm just trying to
8785520	8791080	navigate myself towards the webpage where said stories would be um let's see
8791080	8796360	here let's talk about guitar freaks XG apparently it's been released I'm
8796360	8799880	assuming in Japan because I sure as hell haven't seen one over here then again
8799880	8805720	I've been an arcade in forever but yes guitar freaks Romania XG has been
8805720	8811640	released in Japan and of course you may remember XG is the one where they have
8811640	8815320	the extra buttons on the guitar and then the drums are a little bit fancier and
8815320	8821520	whatnot but uh but is the game fun I don't know well let's go to the phones
8821520	8826340	hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hi this act F hi act F what's on
8826340	8831520	your mind our friendly neighborhood Mexican how are you pretty fine I just
8831520	8838520	wanted to ask a quick question about the ps3 yes maybe look Loki can answer this
8838520	8848180	I've been hearing and reading in forums that there there are ps3 shortages yeah
8848180	8853920	there's rumors going around that I've been hearing it's basically they're
8853920	8859880	trying to sandbag their numbers for the next financial year because even right
8859880	8863440	now God of War 3 there were shortage problems and there's also rumors that
8863440	8869080	there's a disc pressing problem for God of War 3 because I know art we got
8869080	8874720	shorted pretty bad as well as everyone else did apparently but it's been
8874720	8880280	anything first party Sony's been hard to get for like the whole year so far and
8880280	8884440	it's supposed to be a lot better in April when their new financial year
8884440	8887920	starts so that they're basically trying to suck as much sales as they can to
8887920	8891400	next year to make it look better let me jump in for a minute here because yeah I
8891400	8895920	just to support what you're saying I got a text message when ps3 mageddon was
8895920	8900560	going on and it was one of my friends who I guess booted up her ps3 and it
8900560	8904960	was right when the issue happened so nobody knew that there was a time and
8904960	8908780	date issue going on and she thought the thing was broken so she went to Best Buy
8908780	8912380	and text messaged me and said dude you might want to know for your show Best Buy
8912380	8916640	has no PlayStation threes in stock and their computer has one in the nation
8916640	8921260	located in a store and I was like I kind of took that as a really type of thing
8921260	8924320	and I didn't like I got the text messages after the show so I didn't even
8924320	8927080	really give it a second thought but it does sound like there's some type of
8927080	8934480	shortage going on strange yeah I thought it was related to the the apocalypse
8934480	8939960	thing that happened on February 28 no it's nothing to do with that it's just
8939960	8944960	they've been out for a while and usually if there's some sort of time period
8944960	8948760	right after you know the fourth quarter that they're trying to catch up because
8948760	8952440	they basically you know at least on a distribution side they try to ship
8952440	8954960	everything to retailers and the retailers leave them on their shelves
8954960	8960440	and that's that I want to say though it's a blessing in some ways that that
8960440	8964640	happened when ps3 Magetta and happened because think about how many people
8964640	8968960	might have done what my friend did almost did and saying my ps3 stopped
8968960	8971960	working guess it's time for me to get a new one and actually goes out and buys
8971960	8977480	a new one and then oh it was just a 24-hour issue shit you know like well
8977480	8980840	you could always return it I guess so but you know some stores take a fee for
8980840	8984740	that and stuff so it's maybe a blessing in disguise that there were hardly any
8984740	8988960	ps3s on shelves to get so people couldn't have that knee-jerk reaction
8988960	8993880	of oh I'll just get a new ps3 probably thank gosh or else Sony might have been
8993880	8996840	in some bigger doo-doo than they were but you notice how most people already
8996840	9001760	forgot that that happened already already passed it we've moved on
9001760	9006000	interesting Bob coffee in our chat room chat dot orange on twitter.com piping in
9006000	9007720	Walmart hasn't gotten any in a while either
9007720	9012160	giovide says my targets been out for three weeks so definitely not just a
9012160	9015320	best buy thing it does sound like there is some truth to this rumor but you
9015320	9019160	watch if if all sudden in April they start having tons of them everywhere
9019160	9023680	that's why because they were sandbagging them really I didn't think about it that
9023680	9026920	way that's a really that's the rumors Nintendo doing something like that too
9026920	9030560	or are they still saying oh well I don't know you're gonna hear a lot more stuff
9030560	9034320	about Sony this week because destination PlayStation is happening now that's the
9034320	9037920	retail only event but there's always people that manage to sneak their way in
9037920	9042240	moles and stuff of course yeah because we have our people it's kind of bad that
9042240	9045640	that happened it's happening right now it's considering that there's Final
9045640	9052160	Fantasy 13 and God of War coming out next week so I don't know why they well
9052160	9058200	you already explained it but I I would expect them to at least put a little
9058200	9062800	more of the consoles out there in the market keep in mind though act F Sony
9062800	9066720	lost a lot of oomph and people running out to buy a ps3 for Final Fantasy 13
9066720	9071000	when it jumped ship to 360 as well and you know like I've mentioned earlier in
9071000	9074360	the night I think it was over on Bobby show but you know there really is no
9074360	9079080	reason to run out and buy a ps3 if you already have a 360 for Final Fantasy 13
9079080	9082760	just get it on the 360 the differences are not major enough to necessitate the
9082760	9087480	change but God of War 3 now you can't get that anywhere else so yeah I think
9087480	9091700	you make a good point it seems really strange that Sony would not want God of
9091700	9094920	War 3 to be moving because that that's a system seller for some people it really
9094920	9099720	is I know they just figured that they're gonna sell those copies it's just if
9099720	9106320	they don't sell them right now it's no big deal but we'll see I mean well act
9106320	9108760	F we gotta let you go so we can get more calls do you have any other thoughts for
9108760	9114760	us tonight no not really not yes that question right now all right wait you
9114760	9122380	have a good one take it ready adios see since we have all these people that call
9122380	9124920	in from different countries I really need to make it a point to at least
9124920	9127760	learn like hello and goodbye in the local languages luckily I already know
9127760	9132120	Spanish for my time I had in high school but I'm gonna need if IK ripper gets
9132120	9135000	through tonight or whoever from Sweden gets through I'm gonna need to know how
9135000	9140600	to say hello and goodbye in Swedish so and it's not bork bork bork what useful
9140600	9146200	Swedish phrases and words are you googling it yes I am okay well hold hold
9146200	9149840	on to that and if IK ripper call I don't even know if he's listening if he calls
9149840	9153440	tonight I will have you be our unofficial ambassador I can't read any
9153440	9159720	of this hi you're on Orange Laundry do who's this hey spazz nator what's on
9159720	9169040	your mind I'm not much yeah I was just gonna comment on what Loki was seen like
9169040	9176100	five minutes ago you know last week up issued these everything with his one
9176100	9184360	system mean that they won't jerk off this kind of screw them over yeah well
9184360	9190740	you know I try calling the number dollar day you know at least all the day the
9190740	9197840	number was working if you know if he doesn't mind I would like to give more
9197840	9203840	constructive criticism for me oh wait hold on Loki Loki are you willing to
9203840	9207120	accept some constructive criticism yeah sure why not all right then go ahead
9207120	9214120	yeah yeah I know this is kind of some somewhat harsh but I I could have seen
9214120	9222520	this coming a mile away for a couple couple reasons if I put Lussy on
9222520	9228760	Craigslist which is practically the ghetto of the Internet you know you
9228760	9234320	hear reports you know other news by Craigslist practically every other day
9234320	9239840	but the personal ads are hilarious that's true well hold on let me give
9239840	9243640	Loki a chance to defend himself why did you go to the bowels of the internet I
9243640	9246320	mean well I don't know I mean there there are there is 4chan because
9246320	9250320	Craigslist Craigslist is kind of in that same you know colony area of the
9250320	9255600	internet what made you decide to go there to get your needs basically
9255600	9259400	because and you know really looking at it now I could probably just done a
9259400	9266440	j-tag install myself but the thing is I wanted to install the cyclot the the
9266440	9272440	Cygnus to mod ship in there and that's a lot more difficult to install versus you
9272440	9277800	know the just a j-tag a j-tag I mean shit I could I could do that I mean that
9277800	9283040	it's like seven solder points and that's it and they're big but the reason why I
9283040	9286120	went in Craigslist and stuff like eBay although I lucked out on eBay because
9286120	9289120	someone sold it cuz eBay they're not allowed to sell that stuff you can't
9289120	9293000	sell modded consoles you can't sell mod chips you can't sell anything like that
9293000	9297160	every now and then stuff slips through where you can buy that stuff thankfully
9297160	9303000	I was able to buy one of those and really it wouldn't have been a big deal
9303000	9309400	to go you know testing why should done is gone should have just not let the
9309400	9314360	console should have just gone with the car did he try to talk you into it like
9314360	9317240	okay buddy all you know just come back in a couple hours and I'll have your
9317240	9320600	console all done it wasn't even that it was like 30 minutes like I was gonna go
9320600	9328320	eat and whose idea was it to leave his but you know I could see that where that
9328320	9331920	would be something you know we're yeah when you're in that I mean yeah I
9331920	9336240	understand it was 2020 but when you're in the moment and you're like okay I
9336240	9339800	kind of trust this guy he's got his phone lots of for me from Craigslist
9339800	9343240	before and it's been fine yeah and and to be fair although I'm joking about it
9343240	9347840	being you know the bells the internet I I've seen job postings and stuff work
9347840	9352240	on there's people on great companies posted availabilities and Craigslist so
9352240	9357600	there are useful purposes I think if if as far as it goes with like services and
9357600	9361040	stuff like that you just have to be careful as far as like you know
9361040	9365760	especially with adult services for the love of God if you're gonna seek adult
9365760	9370000	services on Craigslist you not only need to use protect you need to use like
9370000	9374080	three methods of protection all at once and that's assuming that it is actually
9374080	9377580	somebody and not just a police sting yeah and then you're gonna want to bay
9377580	9382160	them bleach honestly yeah but you know no seriously you know it's just you know
9382160	9386240	some stupid things and what you need to do obviously if you're getting you know
9386240	9391080	some services done online you know where you're gonna get something taken for you
9391080	9396440	a legitimate person would give you like some sort of receipt you would you would
9396440	9400160	have an address you wouldn't you know go to an address and he'd be waiting
9400160	9405040	outside of like I there's a lot of red flags like for example the address that
9405040	9410400	he gave me you know it's an apartment complex it's not not a house I thought
9410400	9413560	it was a house I was like okay well that guy's address you know where's he gonna
9413560	9418160	go you know it's a house but knows apartment complex where his friend
9418160	9422240	probably lived and let her yeah who knows but he has this down to a science
9422240	9425120	he ripped you off he'll rip someone else up my question is what's he doing with
9425120	9429120	all these 360s I don't know probably selling them all right let me fuck drugs
9429120	9433520	who knows it's a spazz nator I'm sorry yeah I was good yeah I was about to say
9433520	9440240	the same thing for at least 10 to 15 years and now well now throughout the
9440240	9446680	country not just my area or even just your area councils especially when
9446680	9454760	they're still at the $250 to $300 range are really really big with seed they
9454760	9462640	take those $250 to $300 console deal them turn around turn around and sell them
9462640	9469600	for 50 to $100 and Dell or just trade them straight out for drugs whether
9469600	9475680	their drug of choice happen happen you never know and it's a bummer with since
9475680	9480760	Xbox has the ability to lock out your console when you you know when you do
9480760	9484120	something naughty and expose life it's kind of a pity they don't have a type of
9484120	9488060	service where you could call in and find out where your 360 is or who's
9488060	9490520	connecting to the internet and I mean granted they don't want to help people
9490520	9494280	like Loki but some people get their 360s legitimately stolen out of their home
9494280	9497000	like I remember spazz nator weren't you the guy that had your ps3 taken right
9497000	9506200	out of your house yeah yeah yeah and oh well I lean off Bob back in 2003
9506200	9514280	literally just as the calories switch over from July to August two guys
9514280	9524600	barged into my apartment building and it's going by PlayStation 2 I called the
9524600	9530800	police immediately but you know unfortunately you know with buffer
9530800	9536720	police I hate to see it you know what there's like a whole stash of jelly
9536720	9546120	filled bullets it's hard to track to because there's not like unique license
9546120	9549440	plates or whatever but there is I mean there's a serial number I have the
9549440	9554640	serial number but it's a bummer you can't track the way it does it's a bummer Xbox
9554640	9559360	punch in serial number and you know here's the thing tells you where it's
9559360	9563920	the guy knew what he was doing as far as j-tagging stuff because he knew what he
9563920	9568120	was talking about but like he probably not only runs a service he probably mod
9568120	9572200	your stolen 360 and sells it well here's the thing and I don't really have a
9572200	9575920	problem of 360 was stolen I have a problem that I waited you know four
9575920	9581240	hours in Stockton don't waste my time exactly I'm like if you're the DCC to
9581240	9585840	just mug me you know seriously if he's gonna steal my system just don't respond
9585840	9590080	back to any of my phone calls at all instead of like dragging on for four
9590080	9594200	fucking hours okay because that was really the issue I have 360 consoles I
9594200	9597920	don't really give a crap if one of them goes away it's it's just an inconvenience
9597920	9602520	for me to sit there for four fucking hours in a car waiting for somebody I
9602520	9605640	gotta wrap up here and let's fascinating in his final thoughts cuz we had to get

9634520	9637120	four more they're broken so I gotta let's pass nator wrap up because we gotta
9637120	9640680	get more calls spasm nator thank you for the lively discussion inspiration do you
9640680	9645800	have any other lots for our listeners tonight nothing comes to mind nothing
9645800	9652440	they'll take five seconds or less but I'll I'll talk to Loki about this you
9652440	9657800	should wear your eyes throughout the weekend like live or on Twitter or
9657800	9663400	whatever so just be careful he might mess with you like he was messing with
9663400	9666640	cheeseburger oh that was just earlier and hey I can't believe he got so
9666640	9670160	confused by and I was just like he must have me confused the other Loki you're
9670160	9672840	so rude you know all right all right take care of spasm nator thanks for the
9672840	9676860	call have a good one yep I gotta ask spasm nator if he's watching the tester
9676860	9681440	because he's a big Sony fan I mean usually he'll cut he'll call in although
9681440	9684300	he I don't know about anymore because I know he's been having his issue with
9684300	9689440	Sony's lately but I gotta ask him if he's been watching that because it seems
9689440	9693040	like as a Sony fan maybe that's something he's into I don't know I can't
9693040	9697480	believe I'm admitting I've actually been watching the tester it's not terrible
9697480	9703920	I'm gonna file it under the Tron and showgirls category it's it's so bad it's
9703920	9707680	kind of good I can't explain it and seriously the whole reason I put they
9707680	9711120	got the guy's phone number and email cuz I know that the police aren't gonna do
9711120	9713720	anything they're not gonna be able to do anything because they don't have a name
9713720	9717400	they don't have an actual law they just they just have it so at least at the
9717400	9720920	very the very least it'll make them think maybe twice about like doing
9720920	9723440	something like that because it's really inconvenient I've got to get to the
9723440	9726880	phones guys the phones are lighting up tonight like there are so look I have a
9726880	9731040	screen full of people trying to get in thank you guys so much I'm just trying
9731040	9735300	to answer these as fast as I can hire an orange launch radio who's this this is
9735300	9739840	Amiga 777 Amiga 777 what is on your mind my friend
9739840	9745960	hi I just like us to send a public apology to some of the listeners from
9745960	9749600	Japan that might have been listening last week hmm I guess about some of the
9749600	9754840	things that I said about you know the whole PlayStation 2 birthday 10-year
9754840	9766000	thing yeah um it actually you know ps2 is alright it it um there there are a
9766000	9769280	lot of things you know kind of going back to that question you're like what
9769280	9778560	could the Dreamcast it done better and so going back on that um well I could I
9778560	9783920	probably enter the end to that question maybe toward in um let's see October you
9783920	9789120	know which is technically the the month that it came out the ps2 came out here
9789120	9796720	and now the u.s. okay no amiga I remember your call and I don't I don't
9796720	9800360	think you have to go out of your way to apologize it was your own opinion and
9800360	9806120	what-have-you and last week was a little bit crazy anyway but um you know I I
9806120	9809280	think you kind of bring up a point though that certainly the PlayStation 2
9809280	9813160	saw levels of success in other countries that may not have even been you know
9813160	9820680	kind of duplicated here or what have you okay that was just one thing those on my
9820680	9825080	mind all right well you know what it it it takes a real man to man up to an
9825080	9828240	apology although I don't think you needed to apologize he had a perfectly
9828240	9833160	fine opinion but that's that's fine you you said your piece but I I think can't
9833160	9836440	we all just get along there's room there's room in retro gaming love for
9836440	9842800	ps2 and Dreamcast and plenty of it no take care of me guy have a good one take
9842800	9847380	care later eight seven seven game olr is the name to call or is the number to
9847380	9849680	call but our phones are lighting up there's like back-to-back calls hi you're
9849680	9853120	on orange launch radio who's this hey this is Brad from pod culture well hello
9853120	9859200	Brad from cop pod culture what's up mine Oh Loki you are far more laid-back than
9859200	9863080	I ever would be I know just based on your Twitter and some of the problems
9863080	9866360	you I won't get into it cuz on your Twitter so the reason I don't get you've
9866360	9871080	been having with a certain realty company you've been dealing with I I you
9871080	9874600	do not strike me as the type that would be as passive as Loki but I'm redheaded
9874600	9878120	I got the temperament to go with it that's all right that's all right well
9878120	9881120	there's just not much I can do with what the information I have and stuff it's
9881120	9885520	not like I can go the guy's house and demand you know justice I don't know I
9885520	9888000	don't know where the hell he lives and I don't know what the hell's name is I
9888000	9891720	mean cuz he's used like a couple different names and so you know at this
9891720	9897320	point lesson learned you know that's all you have to do you have to use this as
9897320	9900520	an opportunity not that we should be encouraging people to mod their consoles
9900520	9904840	anyway but you had a legitimate I mean I think it's legitimate to want to mod
9904840	9908520	your 360 to play Japanese games every week on this show I talk about Japanese
9908520	9911340	release dates and even just tonight I said oh here's the game on the 360 looks
9911340	9915280	interesting it'll never come out over here so people have a legitimate reason
9915280	9920120	to want to mod their 360 to play Japanese games but let Loki's pain be a
9920120	9925040	lesson to the rest of you be careful and if somebody smart use common sense and
9925040	9930560	oh I didn't use this don't trust a dude you met on Craigslist with your console
9930560	9935040	ever do not walk away don't get talking to it just say no I'll just hang out
9935040	9938080	here well I can I watch you do it or whatever or you know I'll just I'll just
9938080	9943000	kind of just you know sit here and watch you from my car be just upfront honest
9943000	9946880	be like listen dude I don't I just met you I don't fucking trust you so you
9946880	9950320	know I'm going with the console you know you either gonna you know do this real
9950320	9954960	quick and the other thing too I mean it's like seriously if it's going to
9954960	9957800	take four hours I want to be there fucking going hey listen are you done
9957800	9961480	are you done are you done are you done you know or like you know if it's taking
9961480	9965060	too damn long list and I'll just finish the rest of home you know because that
9965060	9970020	it's just it's absolutely ridiculous I have to wait for four hours and it's
9970020	9974680	Just that was the part that pissed me off is the fact that he drug it out for four fucking hours
9974680	9979100	If you're gonna steal the thing just say you just don't reply back or just reply back to the text
9979100	9981100	You know sucker and then that's it
9981700	9985060	He's like seriously. What are you gonna? Do it's like you know I can't track you down
9985060	9990500	I don't know the fuck you live so you know I wish I did follow him cuz then I'd know where the fuck you lived
9990500	9995220	I would be going right straight to his apartment or probably just wouldn't have gotten anything me
9995220	10000240	Oh, just or one of the listeners will have gone straight to his apartment by now, but unfortunately probably there you go
10000540	10006540	Well, I did you have any do you have any any further advice? I guess maybe for Loki don't use crack
10006540	10008500	I don't know I
10008500	10010500	Well, you know trust no one
10011820	10015820	Pretty much if I tore or if you're gonna go use someone on Craigslist or whatever like that
10015820	10021140	Just like be really crazy about it, and they'll fingerprint the guy you know or you know
10021140	10026660	Or if you if he takes your 360 take their driver's license or something
10027540	10031840	That could be fake too. Well most people. I don't think would expect that you know it's true
10032460	10034940	Yeah, the one time I had a console chipped
10034940	10040020	It was somebody who knew somebody and that was back in the day when my PlayStation 1 oh
10041220	10047100	Man the PlayStation 1 was so easy to mod though you had a dark Sakura bought me a plug
10047100	10051780	It's like a present for I don't know something that I just plugged into the back of the thing you did
10051780	10053620	I don't know if you remember
10053620	10056460	Mix I got mine chip just to play two games
10058380	10061060	You did that's how we play remember the one day in my apartment
10061060	10064580	We all came all the sacramentals came over to play DDR third mix
10064660	10068380	That's when I discovered my love for erotic and oh Nick, please not so quick. Yeah
10069020	10071620	The thing that I the IO port thing
10071620	10077420	Mm-hmm yeah, yeah, there's like a little plug in the back you gave me one the game because I think you know
10077420	10081900	I don't have the skills disorder, so I had someone do I also have another our form looking to get rid of
10082660	10086360	We use those for a while, but like for the longest time Dan
10086360	10088360	And I didn't need them because we could still
10088740	10091360	disk swap on our PlayStation
10092180	10094180	The single swap oh
10094300	10097660	Yeah, there was like a trick you could do for it the first one
10097660	10103920	It was just the single stop and swap it would load the um the PlayStation screen, and then you stop the spinner by
10104580	10107940	Pressing the little button to the thing yeah, and then you move it out
10107940	10113980	We used a paperclip to do it crazy crazy stuff all right well Brad anything else in your mind tonight
10113980	10121300	You want to talk about well with the you know games are expensive and stuff, and I've got the studio and turmoil here
10121300	10123300	Cuz we're packing up to move
10123300	10128780	but to save a few bucks and some something that not everyone might think about is
10129660	10132300	I've been buying a lot of games used from game fly
10133380	10137020	Chief I just picked up like brutal legend Batman Arkham Asylum and
10138300	10142280	Ghostbusters for like less than a price of one game new they've been sending me
10142280	10144080	I've actually been using game fly now
10144080	10147580	I have this really bad habit of hanging on to one game for like six months
10147580	10149980	But yeah, they send me emails all the time about hey
10149980	10152140	Do you just want to buy the game you've had for like four months?
10152140	10153500	you
10153500	10157940	Know and it's it's not a bad idea, and I think they give you like a little bit of money
10157940	10159580	I mean, it's like five bucks ten bucks
10159580	10163140	It's not very significant, but it's enough to try and hook you the little fish bait
10163140	10165940	You know I don't know if I hook you you know they're there
10165940	10168960	They're at the top of their game for the service. They're providing
10168960	10172460	It's not a service for ever for everybody, but it's a it's a good service
10173100	10179020	So I don't use it that often just like I'm kind of broke right now, but yeah use games nothing wrong with that
10179020	10184140	There's so many games that came out like a year ago that I didn't have time to play that there's
10184820	10189780	There's 20 bucks a pop now for real for real so good advice to the
10191220	10194380	Gamer in this economy I suppose all right well Brad
10194380	10196180	We got to let you go because our phone lines have been on fire
10196180	10198740	And I want to get at least one more call hey later guys later, buddy
10199260	10205180	Alright again, please don't be butthurt if you don't get through our phone call or of course now
10205180	10209700	It's not lit up, but probably cuz everyone still hears Brad on the phone. I wanted to tell you Rob
10209700	10214920	Yeah, I actually went on to the iTunes store cuz really I wanted to buy Final Fantasy 2
10215980	10221860	And I found reviews for Street Fighter 4. Oh, yes, I come out during GDC. I heard yeah, yeah
10222020	10226220	I'm probably gonna pick it up after payday. I'm just given that out of
10227380	10229380	567 reviews
10229700	10232500	It's it's currently sitting at
10232500	10234740	Let me see okay out of
10235420	10237420	894 ratings it's got
10237940	10242900	668 five-star, so it's currently at a four and a half star. That's not bad
10242900	10247820	And yeah, I couldn't believe though that controls are any good, but we got another call
10247820	10250900	So I'm gonna go to the phones hi you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?
10252300	10259820	CT hey I haven't heard from you in a long time. How are you DT? I know good good good. What's that shirt by the way?
10260580	10262260	What's that?
10262260	10264460	It's not a shirt from our first tournament
10265100	10272220	Way the hell back. Oh my god. That's like finding your class of 96 shirt in a truck somewhere
10272700	10275980	That's awesome. Yes the what would the first tournament was scat right?
10279140	10282220	Cosplay and tournament for those that don't know okay again
10282220	10286940	Let me just let me quickly give the backstory for those that have listened to olr a very long time
10286940	10292340	This show was formed because Loki myself and dark Sakura and DT
10292340	10296380	You're a part of this circle too would meet up at the arcade and play DDR games
10296380	10301000	And that's how we all kind of met and of course our show started about music-based video games because of that
10301000	10306100	But when the memani series started kind of tapering off, you know we branched out to saying you know well hell
10306100	10309060	We play all video games. We don't just play DDR. Let's talk about all video games
10309060	10311060	So that's that's where we've been at for a few years
10311060	10317780	um, but as part of this DDR tournament throwing or as part of this DDR loving circle
10317780	10320940	We used to throw tournaments and the first one we had was scat
10321620	10323620	sacramentals because we're from Sacramento, California
10323900	10327680	Cosplay and tournament and we actually encouraged people to dress up although
10327680	10330740	I think we had like maybe four people all day that actually came dressed up serious
10330740	10333780	and then we had a DDR tournament which actually for its time a
10334140	10337960	Lot of people like Sacramento we had a ton of people show up
10337960	10343280	Sacramento was kind of the place you went cuz you just don't give a fuck like I think a lot of people didn't take our
10343280	10348480	Tournament that seriously, and it was okay like people had fun with it, and you know me you know dark sire
10348480	10353120	You know Loki we're all about just having fun like I think Loki if I remember right Oh Loki
10353120	10356860	I'm gonna embarrass Loki Loki had a dynamite rave routine ready to go
10356860	10361480	And it was it's not really I just I had at one point memorized dynamite rave backwards
10361480	10366120	And he was dressed up like one of the guys from the matrix because it was that many years ago
10366120	10368320	It was because I had a trench coat on and well
10368320	10373900	That's what you look like and he started to dance and I have and I forgot with the but he laughed
10374680	10376680	He didn't go in the corner and cry
10376680	10381840	He just he was he laughed and we all laughed at him, but no we all left with him alright
10382200	10385160	And then we left at him. No. I'm just kidding, but now look
10386160	10390760	Would we have ever had Loki on the show if it wasn't for dynamite rave and probably we would have but yeah
10390760	10397540	All right, so I'm sorry DT. So you found this shirt. What else did you want to say? Well?
10399360	10401360	Yeah
10402680	10408760	Go ahead dark Tetsuya if you have anything else you want to ask us or talk about tonight the best of
10411400	10414120	That the boys were on 3do mm-hmm
10414120	10420040	Oh the best of yes is it are we are we about ready to roll do we have our best of put together yet?
10420040	10421640	Or what's up?
10421640	10425880	Well, I'm just waiting on this to finish up the narration
10426640	10428640	yeah, I
10429480	10431480	Heard we're gonna have a
10431840	10433840	female MC in the in the

10437800	10441320	Narration for the best of and I'm sure there's gonna be a week in the near future
10441320	10444720	We're not gonna be here in fact actually in two weeks
10444720	10450840	I'm at PAX East so you may see the best of as soon as then because I don't know if I'll be here
10450840	10454760	I mean, maybe dark soccer and Loki will still do the show without me, but I don't fly back till Monday
10454760	10456880	So we may not be here. Maybe
10458280	10463200	That'll be a fun show tune in it for that night when I'm not here and dark soccer is running the control board
10463200	10464680	That's gonna be a high
10464680	10468720	You're gonna have to totally show me the stuff that I'm missing by the way can't wait
10468720	10474240	It's easy. This new this new system is so much easier than our old system. It's easy. So
10474920	10477720	It'll be fun. Anything else on your mind our test for you tonight

10485720	10491300	Yeah, I actually passed me. Well, I got this. I don't know if Loki's heard of it the ESR
10492120	10494120	Memory card exploit. Okay?
10494920	10496920	You can play copies on it
10496920	10501680	Mm-hmm. Very cool. Yeah, IDG finally

10512640	10518200	SSJ 100 Matt actually has a really good suggestion chat saying we should try to do a pre-recorded packed show
10518800	10523320	Actually, what I think would be really funny is that maybe there won't be a live show next week
10523320	10529760	but maybe there'll be some type of recorded show and like cuz I know I'm going to PAX with my buddy seg who
10530600	10536600	Who he was part of the oom loud crew and my friend Amanda who's really funny and she's never been on the show cuz I think
10536600	10541120	She works a lot Sunday nights, but she's you've met Amanda. Of course, Jamie, right, you know little little Amanda
10541120	10543620	It's going to PAX. How random is that go?
10544600	10546280	So we're all going I think it might be fun
10546280	10549360	We might do like a recorded thing and then I know all our fans are gonna be there
10549360	10553820	So I will tell you next week if I'm gonna have a hat or a shirt or something
10554040	10558460	To look for me and I need to look at the schedule. I will pin can finish your scarf
10558920	10564680	You should look for the rainbow scarf. Ah, too bad. You can't make me an orange scarf. I can make you an orange scarf
10564680	10566680	Can you whip one up in like a week and a half?
10567360	10569360	This is me. Do you make you a hat?
10570160	10573440	Can you make one that says olr on it might be a little tough?
10573440	10578080	Might be a little tough. I'm not that good yet. Why don't that make you just a big obnoxious orange scarf? Okay?
10578080	10584280	A big obnoxious orange scarf. Excellent. I'll even put fuzzy fringe on it. Excellent. Make it fuzzy and very gay. Okay. Okay, excellent
10584280	10586240	That means the rainbow one might have to wait a little bit
10586240	10590200	It's for it's for a good cause by the way, the skype line is gonna be closed
10590200	10592960	I'm sorry, don't be butthurt if you didn't get through. I'm very sorry
10592960	10597320	Send us an email mailbag orangeonshorey.com quick write it down now what you were wanting to call in about
10598520	10600880	yeah, big flamey orange scarf and
10600880	10605240	I will find a game room like, you know, they do the game rooms at PAX
10605240	10608720	I'm gonna look at what games are going on and especially if there's like a music based one
10608720	10612000	I will make it a point to be there for like DDR
10612280	10616760	Hour or you know as a throwback to how this show started
10616760	10620560	I will make it a point to be there doing a music game thing and I know there's quite a few
10620880	10623080	Olr listeners going so I hope to see you guys
10623400	10628160	Yeah, and I like what act F to say make a pre-recorded pre-pack show and a best of the same week
10628160	10634320	It'll be a little weird because um, you know, it's not Olr without Loki and dark Sakura
10634320	10638000	So I would say it's a spin-off show for the week that might go to the feed
10638000	10641560	It would actually be a show called Rob goes to PAX or something like that
10641560	10644640	And then I don't know what dark soccer and Loki will do. It'll be funny
10644640	10647800	I think you guys should just do something fucking random like next week
10647800	10651140	Just get together and play a game or something and tape it. It'll be funny
10652120	10656640	Anyway, we'll talk about that over the next couple weeks. If you have ideas email mailbag orangeonshorey.com
10656640	10661920	Sj100 Matt says I should be using the Twitter when I'm at PAX so they can stalk me abs so fucking lutely
10661920	10668640	I'm gonna be on the Twitter you prepare to have your Twitter's flooded with tweets from PAX. I will be doing that on the oil
10668640	10672840	I'll be tasteful. Don't worry. It's Sony supposed to be at PAX because maybe we'll get to play the moves stuff
10672840	10678360	I believe so. I don't know that the PAX is sold out dude, and I didn't go as media. I signed up
10678360	10684720	It's just you know, cuz media packs is really nothing special and I'm purposefully going to be a gamer
10684720	10686720	I am NOT going to be a
10687360	10690240	Reporter I meant they just might have it to play, you know, like a little bit
10690240	10693400	Well, they might they might but it might also be very crowded and hard to get in there to play
10693400	10695400	You know what? I mean remember PAX Prime
10695520	10701120	We weren't able to really play anything, but that one hour we were in early. That was still fun though. So we'll see
10701120	10703580	Yeah, it was fun. It was very fun. All right
10705560	10710220	Some folks in chat really like the idea of dark soccer and Loki doing a show without me. Well fine. I see how you are
10710220	10714740	SSJ 100 Matt says have Dan here and have him take Skype calls the whole show
10715380	10719920	This will be the ring you talk about orange on the radio. Hi. I don't care. Bye
10721140	10727540	Shut the fuck up junkie. I like this. I like where this is going replace me with Dan on back tonight
10727540	10729620	This is my Dan impersonation. Uh
10730900	10732900	What?
10732900	10737060	Shut up. I'm saying have a Loki Jamie and Dan show. I think that's actually really funny
10737060	10743460	Yeah, replace the gay guy with Dan. That'll be hilarious. But um, actually, I don't know if I should say this now, but there is
10744180	10746460	Talks going on for Dan to have a show
10747620	10750700	Should I say that? I don't know. Maybe maybe too early too soon
10755020	10757780	Yeah, we're thinking about doing something
10760340	10765460	Vault related and I will say this much currently it is just an olr
10765460	10769780	Project has nothing to do with all games if we can work it in with all games excellent
10769780	10775480	But there's so many great shows in all games that weren't planned to do it just to say show that's not live. So we'll see
10776260	10779600	More to come and that might not be the only new show coming soon
10782380	10784380	All right anyhow
10786140	10787980	All right
10787980	10792400	So chatters like the idea of a Dan show you better see if Dan's gonna be available packs weekend
10792400	10797160	Tell him the chatters demand it. All right, we're gonna wrap shit up. It's time for us to get out of here first
10797160	10801080	Oh last-minute stories. I don't know if Loki cleared him out. So any other last-minute stories you guys have
10802360	10804360	Kitty youtubes don't count us
10808400	10812440	Some more to kind of go back to what we were talking about guitar freaks germania xg
10812880	10819040	it's rumored that the extra song apparently is a remix of mechanical rock and
10819040	10823560	I guess it's me making it go rock jive and
10826000	10828880	That's kind of neat and then okay, so some other stuff
10831680	10836720	Let's see, there's apparently a new guitar game or I guess a new guitar that's out there
10837240	10839280	This is called the power gig guitar
10839280	10841920	It is not only a guitar controller
10841920	10845760	But it's a real guitar and you can apparently use it with rock band and whatnot
10845760	10848880	And you can also plug it into an amp and actually play a real guitar
10850200	10853400	No word on what the cost is on it though. Let me see here. I
10854280	10859780	Haven't said what the cost is on it yet, but it looks neat. I guess if you want a guitar
10861120	10864000	Although I just probably just buy a separate guitar. You know, that's just me
10867160	10873400	Then also there's a little bit more tying in with the whole viral campaign that valve has been doing with portal
10873400	10875880	apparently during their GDC
10877360	10880860	Thing there was a blue screen of death that was created
10881380	10885940	and that there was some error code or whatever and apparently if you
10886780	10890760	Translate the error code. It says suspended until e3 or ee
10891260	10896140	So obviously they're going down something portal twos at e3 da da and da
10897180	10898660	exactly
10898660	10901740	Also, Battlestar Galactica is apparently getting an MMO
10901740	10903740	fracking awesome and
10904340	10908540	It's interesting though. It says that it's being developed for sci-fi
10908540	10914660	I guess by big point which they've done several titles in the genre, I guess before and
10915620	10917620	I guess it'll be
10918220	10924620	Coming out this autumn on the sci-fi s website for an exclusive 30-day period then I don't know where it's going from there. I
10925820	10929580	Gotta say, you know since we've now finally done what we told the listeners
10929580	10931940	We're gonna do for years and we did our fuck show last week
10931940	10935480	We might have to do a frack show the week Battlestar Galactica comes out
10936420	10942980	I'm just kidding awful. I'm kidding. We'll need we need a new epic show idea. I'm sure one will come up soon enough
10946740	10954660	There's still the wheel of wheel of obscenity that I've wheel of obscenity turn turn turn show us the curse word that we should learn
10954660	10958660	exactly
10959300	10961780	Yeah, and that's pretty much it for now, all right
10962820	10966340	That's it. We're gonna do a wrap it up and get on out of here for the night
10966340	10970860	It's a good show though is fun. Lots of lots of ground covered tonight considering, you know
10971140	10973700	This was the week that Final Fantasy 13 came out
10973700	10976420	We did a very good job of talking about a lot of games and not just
10976540	10979940	Not just that one tonight because we talked about it all last week amongst the f-words
10980420	10983140	But anyhow, thank you guys very much for tuning in and listening
10983140	10988060	We really appreciate you guys tuning in and supporting us and and the reviews like I said earlier and all that, you know
10988060	10991740	Once again, I always say this we do this show for free because it's fun
10991740	10994860	And it's it's like getting the family together to have a good time
10995180	10999540	So if you like what you hear all we ask tell a couple people tell one tell two people
10999540	11003540	You know about this show help us spread the word and if you're like Rob, I've told everybody
11003540	11010480	I can't think of anyone else to tell then please post a review somewhere iTunes the zoom listing podcast alley wherever
11010480	11016360	There's plenty of podcasting sites help us spread the word and there's even some folks have gone so far to do forum signatures and stuff
11016360	11020960	That is like way more than we could ask for and really appreciate it. Just you know, so thank you very much
11020960	11027000	Uh, let's go around and get everybody's final thought. I'll start with my final thought. My final thought is I want a taco again
11027000	11031920	Yes, it's a Sunday night tradition taco taco taco dark soccer your final thought. I love my kitty
11032920	11037080	Yes, there's shirmy youtubes now, huh? Yeah, there's shirmy has two youtubes up
11037080	11041640	But I also was watching Maru the cat and that's cute, too
11042440	11044720	Loki your final thought tonight two more weeks
11044720	11050400	I get to play the rock star staff and grand theft auto 4 and I intend on kicking the crap out of them
11050400	11052400	Can't wait. Are you gonna film it somehow?
11052760	11054320	You gotta make that happen
11054320	11058520	Make it happen. I could do that. I guess make it work. That would be sweet
11058520	11064140	But the problem is because they're doing an event because they do these every now and then I always miss them
11064140	11066140	But it's actually during my work time
11066140	11067820	that
11067820	11072300	Happens to take place and it's teams of two that you get to go play against them
11073300	11074780	but
11074780	11080920	I'm just gonna kick the crap out of them and it's gonna be hilarious. Can't wait. Can't wait. All right
