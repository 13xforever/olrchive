14121	24565	Tonight, March 21st, 2010, the Xbox 360 is set to get USB storage, GameStop tests perks for loyal customers, and what PlayStation 3 add-on is selling.
31286	37230	Hello, my friends, and welcome to episode number 360 of Orange Lounge Radio.
37290	38631	I'm having trouble speaking tonight.
39271	40552	This bodes well for tonight's show.
40832	43714	The video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.
43774	52600	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, not here right now, but will be here a little later, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
52680	58864	She's at another commitment right now, but she'll be here about 7, 7.30-ish Pacific time, depending on when that is all over.
59244	64449	But never fear, I am joined by the one and only Techmaster Loki Hello How are you doing tonight, Loki?
64669	80564	Doing fine Good, at least he has chicken Once again, I noticed he stopped by KFC tonight Yeah, I don't know, it sounded good again Alright, that's fine Also joining us tonight, we have a special guest He was here a couple weeks ago and he decided to come on back It is Salacious Pop, or Alan Hello How are you?
81005	82026	I'm good Yeah?
82366	84208	Yes, I'm going to try and talk a little bit more
84948	85929	You're going to try and talk more today.
85949	88551	Good, because you have to fill in for DarkSakura because she's out.
88571	91012	But remember, those mics, not very sensitive, so keep it.
91112	93294	Yeah, a little stage fright last time I was on.
93474	93894	That's all right.
94314	95475	Tonight you're going to be extra sassy.
95595	96196	Yeah, I hope so.
96216	98477	You're going to be our sassy gay friend on the show tonight.
99218	100378	A stupid bitch.
100438	101299	Have you seen those YouTubes?
101679	101899	Yes.
102340	103080	You didn't find them funny.
103120	103761	I'm not a fan.
103821	104241	Why not?
104781	105222	They're funny.
105342	105682	I don't know.
105982	108283	You're not a fan of the sassy gay friend?
108403	109404	Not their fan on Facebook?
109484	109664	Fine.
110204	110804	I think they're funny.
110944	111505	All right, forget it.
113325	120169	Anyhow, we tape live every week, of course, at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
120269	120969	It's 6 p.m.
121009	123050	Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
123190	133815	If you're listening to us live, pull up a chair and join us in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, where we have the first comment tonight from Blackwolf, of course, our good pal who does the show before us here at All Games.
134295	136797	saying in our chatroom, Sky broke into DarkSakura's house.
137037	139218	And X-Link follows that up with Loki picked the lock.
139338	141080	No, Dan is here, folks.
141560	142561	Dan the man let us in.
142881	144062	I didn't come until way later.
144222	148104	He's in the gaming vault right now, and I don't know what he's playing.
148164	150146	He was playing Otomedia's gorgeous...
151846	163950	I sold my Japanese 360 Oh, very cool, okay Yeah, I wondered why you brought a 360 to the show tonight And I thought it might be because this is episode number 360 And I was like, oh, are we going to take one apart live on air?
163970	175714	And I was like, well, that's going to be shitty radio You could do that It's not very exciting Yeah, especially when it's a radio show It's more exciting to hear you bitch about the guy that stole your 360 How's that going, by the way?
175734	176794	The cops ever do anything about that?
177934	179935	No, not yet Sorry to hear it Bastards
180635	189601	Alright, well we always start off the show with a little bit of how was your gaming week, so tonight we'll start with Loki, usually ladies first, but since there are no ladies, Loki will have to be our lady tonight.
189621	191862	I will not be your lady tonight.
193676	194076	That's okay.
194377	195658	Loki, how was your gaming week?
196058	203383	Very uneventful, actually, because I don't know what I was playing this week, but not a lot of new things, I guess.
204323	205624	More Grand Theft Auto, as usual.
206265	219013	Still not enough Grand Theft Auto, I think, because I find myself kind of in a flux as far as going up the leaderboards, just because other people are playing it more than I am, so I go up a lot, and then I come back down.
219233	222796	And I go up a lot, and come back down, because other people are playing it and getting ahead of me.
223636	224397	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
247598	264685	This week though, I am looking forward to being able to hopefully play against some of the Rockstar employees because I know they're going to be doing their event on Tuesday during, I think it goes from 1 to 4 Eastern, I'm not positive, but I think that's the time frame.
265385	266506	4-7 Eastern Final Fantasy XIII
287256	291019	Weren't those character names from Final Fantasy 2 or something like that?
291399	296342	It's Palam and Poram, but the way they spell it in XIII is a little different.
296382	300185	But I kind of am convinced it is a nod a little bit to Final Fantasy 4.
300225	303468	Because I was like, hey, that's a name from something else.
304048	306270	And what is up with Cid being bad?
306590	309492	I mean, first off, Cid doesn't look like Cid.
310092	311213	OMG, spoilers!
311233	313535	There's supposed to be a six-month moratorium on spoilers, remember?
313555	313635	Yeah.
313775	318357	Well, everybody knows that Sid doesn't look like Sid because they had pictures out there already.
318897	319057	Fine.
319077	319757	I figured that out.
319837	320057	Fine.
320578	322958	And, you know, he may be evil, he may not be evil.
322998	325819	He still has an airship thing, some sort of ship.
327000	329701	But it's like emo Sid.
330101	331341	Wasn't Sid bad in 12?
332642	333442	I never played 12.
333562	334443	I can't remember.
334763	339024	I want to say I read, I didn't get far enough, honestly, but I want to say I read somewhere that he was bad in 12.
341045	343207	And I know Cid never looks like Cid, but come on, man.
343247	346389	I mean, it's a stretch right now.
346950	347890	Whatever.
348451	350652	And then, what else?
351373	354375	So, yeah, it's kind of moving along.
354495	363082	And, you know, I'm to the point now where I'm just running past a lot of the battles because I just don't want to fight them anymore and just keep going.
363772	364212	Thanks for watching!
384249	384509	Yeah, right.
384529	384789	Cheatless.
384809	388011	Then you're going to be like, oh, my arcade cabinet, or oh, Grand Theft Auto 4.
388071	389192	Speaking of cheating, though, that reminds me.
389272	398117	I played more Borderlands this week and finally loaded up the new expansion a little bit just because I'm trying to raise my level cap again.
398858	406902	And then we played a little bit of the zombie island of Dr. Ned, and that was kind of fun.
409776	410597	Robot Unicorn Attack
433598	434959	Was that inspired by OLR?
435039	436881	Yeah, kind of, yeah.
436981	443106	Lots of WoW, World of Warcraft, and oddly enough, a lot of Bejeweled and Peggle within World of Warcraft.
443406	444667	So, kind of meta.
445307	448430	Some Warcraft 3, actually, going back to 2002.
449411	450832	Kicking it old school in Warcraft 3.
451252	455556	Blizzard just updated a patch for Warcraft 3 to fix some exploits.
456620	457720	Why now?
457820	458961	It's so far out.
459941	460501	Why bother?
460521	462221	They're awesome and they support their games forever.
462401	464202	How long have the exploits been available?
464642	467102	Were the exploits just found a couple months ago or something?
467703	471263	I think they're just from the previous patch from a year ago.
471924	473424	I guess they're really obscure.
474284	479765	There's so much lore in World of Warcraft that I just launched three to play a few missions from that for nostalgia.
480645	481186	So that's about it.
481886	482846	That's it for your gaming week.
483584	488347	Liquid Parrot says, I remember taking down Sky's high score and bejeweled on Facebook by cheating.
488387	489267	Needless to say, it was frowned upon.
489287	490448	Yes, because cheating cheaters...
502634	505455	are rude, especially in multiplayer environments.
505535	509437	I don't really care that Loki cheats on Final Fantasy XIII.
509477	511838	If he wants to ruin the game for himself by doing that, fine.
512138	512658	Have fun.
512818	514619	I don't care.
514759	518581	I've turned it into a more casual game because now I don't have to waste my time.
519481	522882	You have managed to make it be nothing but cutscenes in Final Fantasy XIII.
522922	525804	It's all it is anyway.
526124	529885	You managed to take what little game there actually was out of Final Fantasy XIII.
530125	531646	You're like, Odin battle, ha!
532699	542323	Actually, the Odin battles or the battles against the summons are actually difficult still because you have to do combo damage to them, not necessarily damage damage to them.
543024	545405	So it's still as difficult as it would normally be.
545645	547445	Everything else, so right through it.
547465	549746	It's like, oh no, this monster's going to be really hard.
550247	550527	Tap.
551167	551867	Okay, that's done.
552047	552468	Thank God.
552608	554188	I don't want to have to sit here for 15 minutes.
555189	555489	All right.
556145	557266	And I'll see you next time.
574114	577797	I didn't, oddly enough, I didn't play Final Fantasy XIII at all this week.
577857	583062	I've just been distracted with, I don't know how many of you heard the call on Bobby's show tonight, but I have a lot going on in my personal life.
583102	587785	Like, I'm going to be changing my day job in the next couple weeks, which is big, and then, you know, I just moved recently.
588286	593950	So, and then, you know, Boston's coming up too, which honestly I haven't given as much thought to, but that is definitely on my mind.
594471	600436	So I haven't had as much gaming time until the weekend when Alan and I just played a crap load of stuff this weekend.
600876	603119	So sadly I haven't really been in Final Fantasy XIII.
603500	605683	And some folks in chat kind of arguing about the Odin battle.
606183	611731	I lost the first time and then once I did the Libra and Alan can vouch for this because he was there.
611791	617058	I did the Libra and read that he was weak to chain attacks and I was like, oh, just use a Ravage Ravage in your party.
617298	617499	Easy.
618099	620042	Well, they're all weak to chain attacks.
636319	638060	Keep in mind when you're trying to fill a stagger bar.
638821	641102	Ravagers increase that bar quickly.
641423	643084	Commandos maintain it.
643424	652650	So if you are trying to get, especially if you're in the part where you're fighting with the metal armadillos or whatever that takes forever to kill, remember that you can use a team of all ravagers.
652710	657874	You just need to paradigm shift over and get a commando in there once in a while to make sure the bar doesn't drop too fast.
658134	658835	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
677069	703699	Anyhow, I don't want to get too much into Final Fantasy XIII spoilers Because I know there's people that haven't even touched it yet But I'm trying very hard not to give story spoilers There's still that one little revelation I picked up on last week That I'm like, I really want to find out if that's for real What I'm thinking, or if I'm just making shit up in my head There's another little twist that you figure out later on I like how the way they kind of addressed it Because you're like, wait a second What's that person doing in that cutscene?
703719	704519	You know, that type of thing
707144	711765	Ionotropic in chat wants to know, how do you read the info after using Libra?
711825	712745	Hit the R1 button.
713405	714966	That's on PS3, I imagine.
715226	716486	It's the right shoulder button.
716646	718246	360, it's the trigger of the shoulder, yeah.
718266	718927	It's the shoulder button.
719347	722627	Okay, other stuff I've actually been playing this week.
723047	725528	Quite a bit, thanks to The Weeknd and Alan being here.
725848	728929	Okay, the one I know people in chat want me to talk about.
729029	735570	We had just a spur-of-the-moment, impromptu battle with Under Sedation Live last night in Perfect Dark.
736030	744076	So the Saturday night show on All Games, Under Station Live, Travis and Breslow, it was their off week because they're bi-weekly right now, or what is it?
744156	749320	No, bi-monthly is when you're every other week because they have Sakura Con on the horizon and John's really busy.
749900	751541	So they're only every other week right now.
751602	752542	So this was their off week.
752702	755384	So they were on Perfect Dark last night really late.
755805	759387	And I kept getting all these messages like, we signed on to play something else.
759527	760928	What were we playing last night on 360?
761209	761769	I don't remember.
761809	762970	We started to play something else.
763310	764111	Rock Band, I think.
764591	765131	Gagapack, Rockband
792620	793520	I played Duke Nukem.
793900	803924	I just never got around to playing Goldeneye because I didn't get a 64 until really late in the game and by that point I just kind of bought it from Mario Party and Pokemon Snap.
803944	804364	Don't judge me!
805905	808706	So somehow I never played Perfect Dart.
808926	809226	So...
810426	812146	But they were like, you gotta get it, you gotta get it.
812186	819148	And I played the demo earlier in the day before Alan showed up, and I was kind of like, okay, well, I don't know, I don't really get this.
819288	827230	I see how it's Nintendo 64, and it definitely looks like they put a lot of work into the overhaul of this, but I don't know, I just, I don't really get this, whatever.
828070	832851	But I'm like, it wasn't bad, it was just, you know, I think this would mean more if it held in my memories.
833491	833691	So...
835576	837217	Finally, he berates me with a message.
837557	840738	Travis sends me a text message going, you pussy, play Perfect Dark with us.
840778	842298	And then Misty's getting in on it.
842838	844439	Just everybody's just berating me.
844479	845419	So I'm like, fine!
845939	848840	I will fucking come play Perfect Dark with you and shoot you all in the face.
849560	859843	So, luckily enough, the Perfect Dark multiplayer is cool enough where both Alan and I could sign into our respective Xbox accounts on the same console and play the split screen, and we were in a match.
860223	870595	So in the match was Travis, John, Misty, myself, Alan, that Nick guy who I haven't talked to, but he was there.
870955	872617	Matt joined us for later matches.
872878	873338	And was that it?
873638	874359	It was like seven of us.
874960	875020	And
875060	884963	And so after Matt joins, he hooks up his soundboard and he's playing all these Duke Nukem sounds through my speaker like, oh yeah, and all these things.
885083	886283	I'm just like, god damn it.
886763	890104	Everybody's laughing so hard, partially because I think most of them were drunk.
890284	891525	I think John and Nick were drunk.
891665	891985	I don't know.
892725	893126	DarkSakura.com
908100	908960	Could you jump in Doom?
908980	909600	No.
909761	910881	No, you couldn't jump in Doom.
910941	912121	So, okay.
912181	913482	So I'm just like, okay, I have to approach Doom.
913502	918003	But you can, and I figured out you can walk in the ladders and go up ladders that way.
918043	919764	Like, I figured that out after a few minutes.
920484	924045	And it was cool because I got to, like, punch Jon in the face a couple times.
924145	925065	And it was fun.
925385	925785	It was fun.
925805	933008	And then there was this weird, like, clipping thing that happened where somehow I ended up below Alan, whose character was on top of me.
933088	935488	And I was punching him in the vagina repeatedly.
935528	935989	In his skirt, yeah.
936009	936649	Because I had no gun.
936669	937149	I had a skirt on.
937429	939750	So it was like I was just punching him in the skirt region.
939790	940470	And did I kill you?
940530	940810	I don't know.
940950	943731	I think finally you thought to look down and shoot me in the head.
943831	944011	Yeah.
944191	944431	Yeah.
944771	945211	And I died.
945271	945691	It was sad.
947311	948232	But Perfect Dark was fun.
948272	949892	We had a blast playing that last night, actually.
949932	950852	It was $10 well spent.
950872	952893	So I understand why people are all excited.
952913	955433	Because it's a good multiplayer game.
955693	956514	Everybody was having fun.
956554	959794	I felt bad for Alan because I only have the one wireless headset.
959834	960595	So I had that on.
960955	962775	And even though I had the mode on where you can –
966756	968097	You can't hear shit through the speakers.
968477	968857	You can't.
968937	971719	Like, I think, Alan, could you hear anything at all coming through the speakers?
972179	976061	Yeah, well, them talking through the TV speakers along with the game effects?
976401	976921	Not really.
977342	979783	Like, you can kind of tell people are talking, but I had no idea what was going on.
980703	984324	And Matt's in chat right now going, although Rob used his boyfriend as a decoy several times.
984624	988165	Well, what we thought to do later on is we were like, is that you?
988265	988765	Yeah, is that you?
988825	990865	Okay, let's walk around together and try to find John.
992746	993746	And assault him that way.
993786	995046	But that didn't work out very well.
995146	999387	Well, I was running around unarmed just so that people could shoot me.
1000047	1003408	So I wasn't really playing for real, which is really sort of shitty of me.
1003508	1005008	Oh, sure, sure.
1005669	1007309	I had zero kills the last two matches.
1007369	1009416	You were letting us win, Alan, of course.
1009436	1010760	I was just running around being stupid.
1012985	1015407	I don't like first person shooters on consoles
1038273	1040537	I love you, such and such player!
1040557	1041619	I'm like, damn you.
1047310	1048270	I'm sorry, where were you?
1048510	1050011	You hate first-person shooters on consoles.
1050171	1054351	Yeah, so I can do it, but I'm more of a stickler for the mouse and keyboard.
1055152	1057272	So I was being stubborn.
1057332	1060053	That's right, because you're like a Half-Life geek.
1060513	1062313	That's something I have to remember.
1062353	1063933	Half-Life is like God to you, right?
1063973	1064153	Yes.
1064353	1066934	Okay, so all this other stuff is crap.
1068634	1072675	But have you ever played the Orange Box on 360, or is that like sacrilege to you?
1073475	1081659	I downloaded the demo for it, which is the beginning of Half-Life Episode 2 on the 360, just to, you know, played it for about a half hour, decided I didn't like the controls.
1082400	1084161	Okay, so you're one of those PC elitists.
1084181	1084541	That's fine.
1084581	1085121	Yeah, a little bit.
1085141	1085441	That's cool.
1085942	1086922	All right, so other gaming weeks.
1086962	1089043	So then we played Rock Band.
1089063	1091084	We finally got around to playing the Gaga songs in Rock Band.
1091124	1095847	And I'll say this because I said it to Bobby on his show because he was talking about how he bought the Eric Cartman poker face.
1096187	1099989	That poker face Cartman thing is the kind of thing that's, like, funny once.
1100829	1104812	I couldn't see myself playing that song over and over again because I liked the song.
1104852	1105672	It's funny once.
1106233	1118100	But if you have a lot of people that come to your house to play rock band, you throw the rock band parties, somebody inevitably is going to pull that song up at a party and go, I want to sing the Cartman Poker Face.
1119681	1122103	We played it once and we were like, ha ha, next.
1122564	1126567	Well, you can at least do a South Park medley at least now because you've got a couple songs.
1126587	1127488	And Timmy, right?
1128108	1130570	And then we squealed because we were able to play Bad Romance.
1131892	1132232	Let's see.
1133813	1134233	Then what else?
1134394	1134754	Today.
1134854	1135655	Okay, so today...
1137048	1137909	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1162027	1189487	so we put in Beautiful Katamari and I'm like okay let's do co-op mode and I was kind of surprised oh it's not split screen oh we're controlling the same Katamari so Alan and I are trying to play and we just keep rolling the Katamari in a giant circle like and there's nothing on the screen to tell you like so and so is tilting the wrong way it's just it was bad like there was nothing to do it just splits the twin stick controls between the two people
1190087	1192509	and it's, yeah, I wasn't feeling it at all.
1192689	1193369	No, it was terrible.
1193429	1195910	After like 30 seconds, Alan was like, turn it off, turn it off.
1196551	1201093	So he decided to do Versus because it's like, okay, I've seen a picture of a split screen on the back of the box.
1201554	1205936	I know this has to have like a two-player true mode in it.
1206236	1207257	Sure enough, Versus...
1207697	1208417	is split screen.
1208658	1210819	And when we were going to the stage select, we're like, oh, home.
1211039	1211839	I'm like, okay, cool.
1211859	1213720	It's going to be like, who can make the biggest Katamari?
1213760	1214421	This will be fun.
1214581	1215641	Okay, now this will be great.
1216282	1220564	No, the battle was roll up the most clothespins in one minute.
1220824	1221144	Go.
1221785	1226347	And it's like this generically square playing field with a bunch of clothespins.
1226908	1228509	And it was roll up as many as you can.
1228789	1232711	And he tried to crash into the other Katamari once in a while and make them lose clothespins.
1233211	1233932	And so we play that.
1233972	1235953	And I was like, this is not fun.
1236673	1237815	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1247321	1276293	and I was like this is shit like I think I literally said after it was over and it's not just because Alan beat me but I was like this is shit and I threw my controller down it was shit it was not fun like a versus Katamari game should be so much better I don't know if they got it right on PS3 you know I even in the single player mode the PS3 is the better game than the 360 and that has nothing to do with the consoles themselves don't start the console wars with me it's just that for what you know beautiful Katamari came first and they made mistakes so maybe they fixed them with the PS3 one I don't know but the
1276553	1304444	PS3, Katamari Forever or whatever is superior to the 361 and I haven't even played the co-op reverses so after that was terrible we decided to go into arcade and we were just kind of looking through arcade games to play and I was like okay Alan what do you want to play like what don't you have yourself and he's like oh you have Double Dragon let's play that I'm like okay like I think I played this for like five seconds when I first downloaded it back when I would just download arcade games to download them like
1304944	1306045	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1319693	1321876	That game does not stand to the test of time.
1321976	1323718	That game is terrible.
1324799	1325600	It's terrible.
1326281	1331347	I feel bad for all of the $5 bills that I extorted from my mother and grandmother.
1331387	1335792	This game's really hard at the arcade, little nine-year-old me playing a bad game.
1337114	1337695	It's awful.
1337995	1342099	It's one of those games I think we really see through rose-colored glasses or whatever they call it.
1342279	1343780	Like, remember better from our childhood.
1344641	1349965	And I don't know if it's just the 360 port or whatever, but there's freaking slowdown and flickering.
1350526	1352387	And the game is just fucking cheap.
1352968	1356431	Like, don't press down too much or you're going to fall off the edge.
1356831	1359534	And it's like this horrible collision detection in the game.
1360134	1363617	And then finally when we got to the end, we had to battle each other.
1364898	1370922	to see who got the big tittied girl and it was like the worst fight in the entire world that we did.
1371403	1372684	And finally I somehow won.
1373044	1378108	Even though Alan hit me with a baseball bat like 50 times, all I did was I had to pull his hair a few times and I won.
1378328	1383932	Yeah, I'm pretty sure that the three punches does way more damage than the baseball bat because I hit you about eight times.
1384312	1388595	Yeah, so we played our way through Double Dragon and we were like, what the hell are we thinking as children?
1388635	1390856	This game was better, it was better on the NES, honestly.
1391256	1394078	I would rather play the NES version of Double Dragon than the 360 version.
1394098	1395859	The NES version was awesome.
1396540	1401463	Although now I'm worried, I'm like, I wonder if I'm just remembering that one more fondly than I deserve to.
1401643	1407147	No, it's just like Contra, like Contra on the arcade, I didn't really care for it, but on the NES it was cool.
1407927	1409048	VidPower in chat says, 50,000?
1409549	1412472	You scored 50,000 points on Double Dragon?
1413033	1413894	From the movie The Wizard.
1414875	1419080	Dude, if you can score like 50,000 points on Double Dragon, that actually is really impressive.
1419120	1424166	Like I have a lot of respect for a gamer that can do that now after seeing how fucking cheap that game is.
1424506	1430029	Like, I kid you not, the last boss will shoot you in the back with a gun and you will die instantly.
1430550	1432051	Insert quarter to continue.
1433251	1434472	Like, what the hell?
1434512	1436793	No wonder they removed that game from Xbox Live Marketplace.
1436814	1437354	It was bad.
1438154	1440476	So then I said to Alan, I was like, well, fuck it.
1440516	1442137	Let's just make it a bad game day.
1442717	1456747	and so that's when I reached for Fusion Frenzy 2 yes the game I spent $60 on when it first came out I decided to pop it in because I'm like Alan no you have to see how fucking terrible this game is so we played like what four which by the way if you've never played Fusion Frenzy 2
1457848	1462449	It's kind of like Xbox's answer to Mario Party, but with a more science fiction future theme.
1463089	1466830	So we flew to the planet Moisture to do some battle in some water.
1466850	1468791	No one should ever fly to the planet Moisture.
1468991	1471832	To do some battle in some water-themed stages.
1472632	1474392	And Alan, what were your thoughts on Fusion Frenzy 2?
1474952	1478653	It was emotional abuse, and I'm upset, and I need to call a shelter.
1480354	1481814	Gamer spouse abuse.
1484055	1485215	What was so bad about it?
1487000	1495730	Just, the host was in like his pink jumpsuit with the spiky hair and you could tell that it was sort of, you know, edgy, like designed by committee.
1495930	1501937	And it was really just sort of the showgirls of party games, but without any of the breasts or anything that makes showgirls great.
1503919	1504560	It was awful.
1505441	1507143	Dude, showgirls of party games would be awesome.
1509432	1510352	Wait, wait, Dan, Dan, Dan.
1510372	1511553	We got to get Dan on mic with that.
1511573	1513073	Can you hand Dan the mic real quick?
1514013	1515714	My Double Dragon score is 68,920.
1515934	1518194	Can I shake your hand, sir?
1518294	1519175	I want to shake your hand.
1519215	1520835	You are a gaming stud, sir, Dan.
1521175	1521575	Now, Dan.
1521595	1523916	I have to say, for the record, I'm listening to you guys talking here.
1524616	1526296	Your opinions about games are all crap.
1527757	1529117	The Arcade Contra is awesome.
1529761	1531122	I like Contra.
1531142	1532423	Double Dragon rules.
1532443	1532883	Wait, wait, wait.
1533143	1534864	When did I say shit about Contra?
1535125	1535405	I did.
1535505	1535925	Oh, you did.
1536005	1537026	Okay, well, fuck Loki.
1537266	1537526	All right.
1538207	1539227	Double Dragon rules.
1539568	1541229	Double Dragon sucks.
1541609	1542850	It has slowdown.
1542970	1543970	It has flicker.
1544331	1545131	It's cheap.
1545451	1547573	The weapons don't do shit.
1548173	1549274	It's all about the elbow punch.
1550819	1551660	But you are right.
1551760	1552961	There are no good Katamari games.
1553041	1553902	Except for the first one.
1554082	1554903	What other games?
1555003	1555563	I will say this.
1555723	1561669	To Double Dragon's credit, there are no other games where you get assaulted by transsexual bitches carrying whips.
1562209	1565252	Like, no other game do the trannies come out and force you to try to kick your ass.
1565652	1567194	Like, I can't think of any.
1567474	1568035	Streets of Rage 2.
1571872	1572593	Very good point, yes.
1601770	1606633	Turn off the... We gotta go to the arcade right now and play Yaris, right now.
1607133	1626704	And the minute you launch the game Yaris, for those that forgot, because it's been a few years, and I'm gonna bring back all your haunting memories of the past, the game starts with a Yaris, like, driving... No, no, there's, like, a little robot spider on the ground, and then it pans out, and a big Yaris drives in, and a robot claw comes out of the hood and, like, zaps the robot spider.
1627204	1629766	And I look over at Alan, and Alan just has this, like...
1630646	1630886	What?
1631226	1632067	Look on his face.
1632107	1636089	I thought it was like a Pixar intro, like a cute car animation.
1636409	1638370	Like, all right, this is the opening sequence of the game.
1638410	1639251	No, that is the game.
1639271	1642652	You're shooting little gas pump spiders.
1643173	1643353	Yeah.
1643513	1646574	So then I made Alan, I made him play a race.
1646634	1649656	I was like, no, you need to play a really bad game and see what this is like.
1649716	1650577	So I made him play a race.
1650597	1652217	And that's when he started going, this is rape.
1652277	1653218	This is emotional rape.
1653258	1653818	I don't like it.
1653858	1654419	This is bad.
1655159	1656139	And then, yeah.
1656720	1658961	So what did you think of yours?
1660925	1663960	I am very happy to hear that it was free.
1666821	1669703	and for promotional purposes only.
1671204	1675367	And then finally, once that was over, I redeemed myself with some Fatal Fury special.
1675727	1689057	And not only is it bad in the fact that the game is just horrible and of poor quality, it also is bad in the fact that it led the way to pirating Xbox Live Arcade games on modified consoles.
1689597	1690818	Thank you, Yaris Exploit.
1693780	1702525	So there is no good redeeming value about that game, other than the fact that it can make the bottoms of worst lists and stuff like that.
1702805	1705106	Yeah, I don't know what else to say about that.
1705206	1712530	I mean, it's kind of funny, though, because we also somehow forgot to mention we were playing Puzzle Fighter 2 over the weekend somehow, and that's a game by Backbone Entertainment did that game.
1712850	1716372	They also did Yaris, and you're kind of like, my how the mighty have fallen.
1716392	1716492	Yeah.
1718220	1718701	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1734518	1735799	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1760160	1763021	Anyhow, we'll let her talk about her gaming week when she gets here.
1763641	1764321	Housekeeping tonight.
1765701	1770262	First off, I want to give a big thank you to some of the people behind the scenes at OLR.
1770282	1772742	I mean, obviously, we have a lot of people behind the scenes that make things work.
1773382	1775483	Deekman and VXChaseXV who do the website.
1776223	1780804	But also, DarkTetsuya does a lot of work for kind of like writing on the website once in a while.
1780824	1782704	And I know ActDeft does some work with him as well.
1783384	1789085	And I know DarkTetsuya and Misty kind of got together for this side project that is the OLR Best Hits.
1789685	1794007	and it's the greatest hits, if you will, of our first 20 episodes.
1794027	1802731	And when I mean our first 20 episodes, I mean the first 20 episodes from 2002, back when we talked about nothing but DDR.
1803172	1805833	So it's done, it's up, and you can download it.
1805893	1810235	The only thing I want to warn you about, it was a totally different show back then.
1810535	1812616	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1831460	1838006	Um, and we were running a modem friendly, dial-up friendly, 56k friendly radio stream.
1838046	1840888	So the audio quality was not that great.
1840908	1846293	So I just want to warn you, if you're going to go check it out, keep in mind the audio may hurt your ears a little bit because it was dial-up friendly.
1846733	1850056	But if you want to hear the kind of stuff we talked about a year ago, it's pretty cool.
1850096	1851057	So I really want to- A year ago?
1851397	1852538	I'm sorry, years ago.
1852558	1853379	Haha.
1854920	1856661	I want to thank DarkSakura for putting that together.
1857021	1858322	It's pretty funny.
1858983	1859223	All right.
1859663	1861204	You can find that at orangeloungeradio.com.
1861224	1862105	It's right there on the front page.
1863946	1865107	Other housekeeping tonight.
1865127	1869730	We do have a list list coming up in part B tonight because it is our 360th episode.
1870210	1873733	So we have a list list in tipping our hat to the Xbox 360 tonight.
1874093	1882599	So we'll get into that a little later on in the show in part B. But if you want to vote, you have to be in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
1883211	1885192	All right, let's get into some actual gaming news.
1885212	1888093	Because Alan and I have been talking about a lot of old games.
1888653	1890014	So let's get into some new games.
1890134	1892095	And oddly enough, some 360 news.
1892135	1892555	Yes, Loki?
1893055	1899658	Yes, this week we had some images leak out of a possible slimmed down 360.
1900559	1910183	And much like images leaked out before of a 360 with an HDMI port on it, I have to say this is probably going to happen too.
1910623	1912164	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1929116	1938178	Also, they've combined the GPU and CPU into one chip, and it's got an actual, kind of a different cooling system now, just more like a traditional heatsink and fan.
1940419	1949421	Also, the memory card slot is missing, but once again, that kind of gets into something we'll be talking about probably a little bit later.
1951182	1954522	But it's interesting, and I have a feeling this is probably going to be out by the end of this year.
1955243	1956483	I will bet you anything.
1956843	1966931	Project Natal Do you think Natal is built into this thing?
1967131	1968412	No, I don't think it is.
1968553	1970774	I think it's going to be just an accessory.
1971015	1977580	I just think the system is going to be slimmed down kind of to appeal to more of the Wii crowd type thing.
1977600	1979802	Maybe they're going to drop the price on it or something.
1979822	1979902	Yeah.
1980416	1981998	Now what's the source of these pictures?
1982018	1983901	Because I want to try and figure out how true this is.
1983921	1985163	Because remember guys, this is a rumor.
1985223	1986885	So what's the source of these pictures?
1987686	1991431	The source, it's apparently from some Chinese tech forum.
1991752	1993254	Apparently it was...
1995754	1998458	I'm thinking that it's probably leaked from some sort of production line.
1999160	2010338	The same type of forum leaked out some other revisions of... Yeah, I seem to remember the first PS3 Slim info was coming from an Asian web forum because that's what the factory...
2010982	2011803	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2027958	2050544	um you know stuff like that and different like power headers and what not um that are I mean this one looks like the CD-ROM or the DVD drive and then probably they're gonna have one that's gonna plug into the SATA drive um if it's gonna be internal so it's interesting okay so Loki on a scale of 1 to 10 1 being this is a fucking lie and 10 being this is fucking happening how true is this rumor?
2050664	2055565	I'd say it's probably 10 that's that's a pretty pretty big bet alright well it's okay
2055805	2056947	Where there's smoke, there's fire.
2057488	2061493	Yeah, I realize that we're only a few weeks away from April Fool's Day, but come on.
2061614	2063917	I mean, it just makes sense that they would do this.
2064157	2069525	And like I said, with the other news that's coming out, it makes sense why certain things are missing from this.
2069685	2071328	So, you know.
2072080	2078024	Spyro in our chatroom, chat.orange.com says, we already have normal 360s, we don't need slimmer ones.
2078284	2081286	Yeah, that's what the PS3 people said too, but now they have slim PS3s.
2081767	2082887	And it was the best move they made.
2083908	2085709	Well, they made the cost of the console cheaper.
2086310	2086570	Yeah.
2086710	2091373	You know, by consolidating some parts and taking some things that weren't really used very commonly out.
2091413	2093514	Like, what did they take out of the other PS3 model?
2094575	2094875	Was it USB?
2094895	2097297	They took out USB ports and stuff like that, but...
2099423	2106887	Yeah, it's just slimmer dies and parts get cheaper.
2108307	2109648	Well, and that's my other thought.
2110208	2115611	Part of why I think there is a lot of truth to this is that it makes sense that they're trying to consolidate some of the parts.
2115971	2117412	Because you're talking about a price reduction.
2117432	2126356	Because how awesome would it be if Microsoft gets the price low enough where they can launch a 360 console with Natal for $199,000?
2128117	2130479	That's what they charge for their low-end 360 now, right?
2131080	2130479	$199?
2131460	2133662	What if they could do that with Natal for $199?
2134763	2139407	That's a pretty big kick in the pants to Nintendo come this Christmas season.
2139467	2143010	Although, if that were to happen, it's not out of the question.
2143030	2143951	Nintendo might say, $99 a week.
2147085	2148826	It might not make a difference.
2148846	2155189	So I think right now at the point, I mean, $99 Wii would be kind of cool because then people would be like, oh yeah, I'm going to definitely pick up one of those.
2155269	2158251	But picking up a system doesn't mean you're going to buy the games for it.
2158611	2162613	I mean, look at all these people that bought just the Wii for Wii Sports.
2163113	2163974	And that's all they're playing.
2165395	2166755	And they're not buying Wii Sports Resort.
2167196	2168336	And they're not buying anything else.
2168516	2169857	They're just playing Wii Sports.
2171707	2174709	or, like me, I haven't played the Wii in months.
2175450	2183396	Neither have I. In fact, I was going to hook it up this week to play Rondo of Blood, which for some reason isn't on our show all night, but it finally got its release on Monday, which is exciting.
2184297	2186999	It's because Jamie's not here for Part A tonight, so that's how we missed it.
2187419	2191062	But Rondo of Blood came out, and I was like, oh, I should hook up the Wii and download it.
2191082	2195546	But then I was like, let's play terrible games on the 360 instead, for whatever reason.
2196046	2196747	So, I don't know.
2197307	2197447	Um...
2198448	2207172	Allen, I know you already own a 360, but do you think there's anything here that maybe somebody who already has a 360 might want to get one of these?
2207332	2210894	Do you think there's anything in here for us gamers that probably already have one?
2212595	2216537	Maybe to try it up so that hopefully the Red Ring of Death...
2217057	2217858	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2248117	2248918	Thanks for watching!
2262563	2263284	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2283899	2291144	Out of curiosity, you brought up modding, and you've talked a lot about the different mods out there, like the JTAGs and so forth, the 360s.
2291504	2293365	Do you think part of this is to combat modding?
2293725	2298688	Maybe, because the JTAG stuff right now, they've already patched it out.
2300089	2302250	It's just, you have to have an old enough...
2303231	2304412	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2332827	2340502	those now they're figuring out how to mod as well but a lot of them aren't with an old enough dashboard to be able to do it
2342496	2344538	I'm sure they're going to find a way to do something.
2344778	2348081	At the very least, they're going to find ways to add a bigger hard drive if you want it.
2348902	2355147	But they may actually, if they're smart, go the route of Sony and allow you to upgrade your own hard drive.
2355968	2363074	Well, we'll see because I think we have another story coming up about further evidence that the Xbox 360 hard drives may be a thing of the past.
2363575	2367979	But first, I want to get into another story about the 360 since it is episode 360 of our show after all.
2368679	2370240	and talking about a patent.
2370380	2370980	Yes, that's right.
2371400	2372101	Thanks to the U.S.
2372161	2380244	Patent Office and people having to, you know, file those patents to protect their ideas, sometimes we get spoiled on things that may or may not actually end up happening.
2380284	2381905	Like, I think we've seen patents in the past.
2382445	2389208	Didn't Nintendo trademark, like, or, I mean, I guess there's a difference between trademark and patent, but, you know, for the purposes of rumor spoiling, it's very similar.
2389748	2392370	All those people to try and get to the ideas before them.
2417368	2423812	Well, anyhow, this, though, sounds very feasible to me, and this is a Microsoft patent that apparently was filed back in mid-2008.
2425633	2435579	What would happen is that with this interface that they're patenting, you would actually be able to download a game add-on from the Xbox Live Marketplace.
2436039	2437240	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2460738	2469803	It would be like, for example, I was playing Borderlands, and say my friend was playing, and he wanted to join my game, and he doesn't have the expansion that I have.
2471223	2478167	And I want to clarify, I'm sorry, but this is an important point of the trademark, is that the content that you buy is required...
2478547	2479628	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2503045	2528627	and that's what you pay for a Microsoft system like it would be that easy I'm imagining other things like Game Room would kind of tie into this too I was trying to think of I was trying to come up with this I was trying to explain to Alan yesterday and I don't think my point really came across very well I was like I think Game Room is kind of like Rock Band I think Game Room kind of has a lot in common with Rock Band it's a system that's really going to make their bucks off of all these microtransactions
2529267	2533089	is where, obviously, they're not making any money off of the shell of the game.
2533470	2538713	And it's kind of like, well, yeah, you pay $40 up front for Rock Band, but you get all these default songs.
2538753	2543115	But for Game Room, you pay zero, you get nothing, but the whole thing's out of microtransactions.
2543455	2550019	It's actually like, a better comparison would be that Game Room is more like that PSP demo for Rock Band Unplugged.
2550039	2550580	Do you remember that?
2550960	2555823	They came with one song, and all the rest would play just DLC is all it would play.
2557044	2578958	it's almost kind of like that but for classic games so anyhow but that might be another one hey you go visit your friend's game room and they want to play you in a battle of I don't know what's a two player game Contra or something you know even though you've already bought that on Xbox Live some time ago well you could press X and you can buy Contra for 300 Microsoft points and go to town
2579898	2582740	So it's just making it easier to spend your imaginary money, essentially.
2585782	2587803	And you don't have to quit the lobby to do so.
2587843	2594088	That's another important thing, too, is that sometimes if you want to buy an expansion, you have to back out of the lobby, go back to the menu, do this.
2594468	2596329	No, it would be a lot faster this way.
2597970	2598330	I don't know.
2598390	2599231	Is this dangerous?
2600012	2606696	Is this something that maybe they shouldn't be implementing because it makes it almost too easy to download games?
2606956	2608137	Or what?
2608317	2609458	Or is this just a logical?
2610259	2612260	Yeah, this is more of a give me your money type of step.
2612781	2613922	I think it's just it makes sense.
2613982	2615023	It makes it more streamlined.
2615283	2619767	I mean, you don't have to do it, but I don't know.
2619787	2620448	It makes it easier.
2620808	2627715	I would worry that there's like 13-year-olds that are going to sit there and hit the button, but hopefully their parents know about parental controls and there's no credit cards on file.
2628087	2635738	iTunes and Amazon already have one-click purchasing, where you can just, with, you know, one-click buy TV, whatever.
2636119	2643750	So just to have that, for Xbox to have that in their marketplace, I mean, other online stores are already doing this, so...
2644150	2644690	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2664281	2679803	and what you do now is if you click you don't click on buy song but you click on the little drop down next to that and you click add to wish list and they say that the wish list replates the shopping cart but I think the way they did that was really shady like I hate the way that Apple handled that
2680203	2680904	Thanks for watching!
2697237	2712177	and if there was a song I liked that they played on the radio I would go into iTunes search for the artist right there add the song to my cart and like at the end of the week I'd download all the songs I have a new CD for my car like it was an awesome system but then when iTunes switched it up so now it's just click and you buy right away
2713086	2714486	I thought that kind of was shady.
2714846	2719207	Like, yeah, they have the wish list, but come on, Apple fans.
2719548	2721288	They made that harder to get to.
2721848	2724309	They made it harder to have a queue.
2724509	2729130	They made it easier to buy a game right away, which was kind of crappy in my opinion.
2729690	2734391	But that's a good point, Alan, is that this system already really exists in other places.
2734511	2738492	And there's no, even without Microsoft bucks on iTunes, it's real money.
2739266	2741388	USB Storage Support for the Xbox 360
2758927	2770298	And I just bought one of those memory cards not that long ago, although I don't think I bought the half a gig one.
2770458	2771959	Maybe I did, but it only cost me $20.
2772199	2778866	Whatever I bought was $20, and it came with Geometry Wars, which I tried to give to Alan, but you couldn't take it off the memory card.
2779426	2796571	which was stupid that is dumb but thankfully you will be able to use your USB memory cards to go ahead and save your games you can do download content, save games games in demand, title updates etc.
2798731	2820607	and um the thing is though you will only be able to use cards up to 16 gigabytes meaning you can't just plug in you know say a USB hard drive or something like that that's 120 gigs or those fucking terabyte drives now that what you just bought one of those not that long ago right how much does that set you back for the one terabyte USB drive
2821127	2822468	Yeah, about 110, 120, yeah.
2822548	2826010	It's disgusting how much data you can take with you on the go now.
2826110	2835837	So, I mean, at the very least, you can store, you know, say, you know, just without using a USB hub, you know, a good almost 60 gigs on there.
2836077	2844643	I mean, now, I'm assuming, I don't know if you can use, like, USB hubs on this, but maybe you could even plug in more drives if you really wanted to.
2845364	2845544	But...
2847250	2848631	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2868567	2870769	You can play a movie or a music file off a USB stick.
2870809	2873992	Yeah, you can do that, but you can't store stuff from the 360.
2874313	2876354	You can't transfer saves or anything like that.
2876915	2878897	And that's what this is basically going to allow you to do.
2879337	2887625	However, this also once again plays into what we saw with the supposedly slim 360 motherboard.
2887885	2889267	There is no memory card slot.
2889287	2893671	There's just the front USB port, the back USB port, and that's it.
2894151	2898916	So it makes you think, okay, so they're just going to use USB storage if you want to do a memory card.
2899276	2900517	And I think that's a good idea.
2900817	2905522	Because, to be honest, the Microsoft storage is really, really overpriced.
2905962	2908364	And their hard drives are really overpriced.
2908404	2911967	So I do hope that they allow users to use their own hard drives.
2912668	2913008	DarkSakura,
2935300	2935981	10x the storage
2953564	2960587	Well, I think, you know, and I'm reading in our chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com, YYR says the limit will be two drives according to reports.
2961168	2965209	But even then, take two 16 gig drives, that's 32 gigs.
2965310	2967290	That's still quite a bit.
2967350	2972333	I mean, yeah, it's not as big as the 120 gigabyte, but that's enough for most of you guys.
2972393	2978115	Like, if you don't do video on the 360 and you don't install a lot of games, you're in good shape.
2978176	2980737	And honestly, I don't know how much good it would do to, well...
2981457	2981997	I take that back.
2982137	2986678	Do you think it would do a lot of good to install a game to a USB stick as opposed to just doing it on a regular hard drive?
2986718	2988918	I guess the difference would be unnoticeable.
2990059	2993179	But I keep thinking... I would think maybe the USB drive might be a little bit faster.
2993299	2999360	It's hard to say because the hard drives that are in there right now, they're just... I want to say they're 5,400 RPM.
2999440	3006402	They're really... I mean, they're standard for a laptop drive, but when you're talking about desktop drives, they're 7,200...
3008163	3009284	It's obviously a little slower.
3009745	3012348	And it's also flash, so there's really no moving parts.
3012829	3018356	So really, you'd be limited by the speed of USB 2.0, which would probably be, I would say, faster than that drive.
3018530	3018950	True story.
3044051	3045032	That's a dumb excuse.
3045232	3045733	I'm sorry.
3046954	3054043	If they're going to screw you for those hard drives, just use different hard drives.
3055465	3060311	Speaking of dumb excuses, let's go to another completely different type of story here.
3060351	3062754	This is a story that has to do with GameStop.
3063354	3065235	and also has to do with console shortages.
3065836	3071259	And apparently GameStop has commented on the recent Wii shortages and PlayStation 3 shortages.
3071640	3076143	And they're saying that those shortages do not look like they are coming to an end very soon.
3077484	3087610	There's a quote here from Tony Bartell, who is the executive VP of merchandising for GameStop, saying, quote, they could sell a lot more hardware than what we have on both the PS3 and the Wii platform.
3087911	3091493	They are saying it is not going to end until early summer is when this is projected to end.
3091613	3118675	and then by then they're going to have another console iteration and it's just going to be the same damn thing all over again just to clarify they say the Wii is supposed to get the resupply first and he thinks this is all because of the surge of the sales of the consoles from the last holiday season I've heard a different theory though and that has to do with and I don't was it you was telling me this Alan somebody was telling me this about the whole fiscal year that was you on a previous show
3119876	3123417	The fiscal year... Did you think the fiscal year is playing into this on both Nintendo and Sony?
3123858	3124198	I don't know.
3124218	3126479	They're just dicking around though right now is what I know.
3126999	3131380	Because first party anything from Sony is like damn hard to get right now.
3133021	3135642	So, who knows what the situation is.
3135702	3137063	And unfortunately, you know, the...
3138163	3139544	I just don't see why you would, you know, not.
3167608	3174592	Well, and how many freaking PS3s are being sold right now?
3174672	3177514	I mean, it just doesn't seem like it's as in demand right now.
3177574	3179495	Maybe for birthdays and stuff, but that's it.
3180235	3182497	A lot of them have to do with the fact that they're hard to find right now.
3182817	3184018	But I'm sorry, I mean...
3184978	3186299	How many years has it been out?
3207174	3212278	They're trying to purposely hold them back to create this sort of demand for the console.
3212298	3213098	That's pretty dumb.
3213419	3214780	People are seeing right through it now.
3216181	3223967	Just while Loki's been talking here, I pulled up BestBuy.com just to see because they let you do a store search to see what the inventory looks like.
3224027	3225688	They have a couple packages available.
3226349	3226589	There's a $299.99
3228971	3233073	Sony, PlayStation 3, it's the slim, so it's like the slim by itself.
3233453	3233853	It's the 120.
3234053	3239155	It is sold out online, and if you go into to do like a store search, it won't even let you.
3239175	3240756	It says store pickup, not available.
3241036	3241896	So that is gone.
3242397	3244137	Now there's a $349.99 console.
3244217	3246258	It's a 250 gig.
3246838	3251160	You can buy it online, but then there's this red thing that says not available for shipping.
3251700	3255322	So I guess you could maybe only do the in-store pickup.
3255962	3265650	Well, I did a search around the local zip code here, and the six closest stores in the Sacramento area, Citrus Heights, Arden Fair, Folsom, Roseville, Natomas, Elk Grove, all out.
3265971	3266451	Unavailable.
3267012	3268513	So, the shortage is real.
3268553	3269434	There's no disputing that.
3270114	3273097	But it's weird why that this is happening.
3274278	3281424	And, like I said, the theory, and it could be just someone talking, but the theory is that they're
3283257	3284698	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3306135	3320218	Final Fantasy XIII, although granted, the whole 360 thing, you know, if gamers want it, and they have a 360 already, they can just buy it there, and I know there's been a lot of back and forth about which version is better, but there's no difference, you guys.
3320738	3323038	The differences are minuscule, so just drop it.
3323058	3330240	I'm wondering on the audio, though, a question just to go on the Final Fantasy real quick, and this is totally random, but how's your audio sounding on that?
3330320	3334501	Do their voices sound kind of metallic, I guess, to you?
3334781	3335041	I mean...
3335821	3337623	No, but that could be your sound setup.
3337704	3345572	But I have surround sound headphones, and I've done everything to try to configure it so that the sound sounds okay, but it still sounds kind of metallic.
3345913	3346753	Seems okay to me.
3346834	3348475	Like it's heavily buffered or something.
3348495	3349216	Hmm.
3350427	3351568	God of War 3 God of War 3
3369446	3389892	to have your big game out and not have the systems to back it up especially if it's intentional if it really truly is an unintentional shortage then okay whatever just bad luck but if it's an intentional shortage that was dumb then they should have delayed God of War 3 saying you know quality issues or whatever they would have lied and said it was a quality thing or something
3390772	3394514	It's what they have coming out from first party for Sony in the next couple months.
3394994	3395434	Not much.
3395754	3398876	I mean, they have Mod Nation Racers, but that's in May.
3400197	3403398	And then after that, well, that's it.
3404258	3408020	So, Mod Nation Racers, which I don't think... Well, and then the move is later in the year.
3408040	3409301	But that's not until the holiday.
3409341	3409561	I mean...
3411764	3412084	I don't know.
3436476	3438957	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3460347	3462430	Thank you for watching!
3475886	3483475	It says, we believe that the loyalty program at Micromania drove some of the highest sales per store in Europe that we've seen.
3483976	3491105	So we think it's a very effective program and that's the base for what we added to our existing loyalty program here at The Edge.
3492407	3492767	So...
3499074	3502277	Micromania had the MegaCart program for many, many years.
3502717	3505860	It's probably the most successful video game loyalty program in existence.
3505920	3513227	If you look at Micromania, as we did early on, 86% of their transactions have a MicroCart ID associated with them.
3513727	3516149	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
3539850	3540991	How theirs will be different.
3541251	3547693	Our program will be heavily built on heavily what you see at Micromania today but it will add some very significant pieces.
3547773	3552574	Our marketing team has done some extensive surveys like we saw linked online.
3554835	3556097	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3573557	3573898	and many more.
3599983	3604647	I feel like when you're reading a story like this about GameStop and their programs I should be playing a song like this We can try that
3616778	3617719	Join us in our rewards program.
3649179	3650239	Alright, seriously though.
3650500	3653421	I mean, is there enough here to really get that customer list?
3653541	3656203	As if they needed to stomp out more of their competitors.
3657164	3659445	They're completely vague in that though, so that's the thing.
3659705	3668531	Unless I see a sheet that says what I'm getting exactly and what I have to pay into it to get, I'm not exactly sure if it's something I really want to participate in.
3668991	3676255	But hey, if it's like the end of the GameStop cards now where I pay $15 a year and I get discounts and whatnot, I mean, that's kind of cool, I guess.
3676496	3677556	And I get a magazine at least.
3677596	3678937	I can thumb through it once a month.
3680418	3681859	Frisbee in our chat room says...
3682993	3684535	I am your retailer.
3701656	3720849	and this has been done with quite a few Sony games if I'm not mistaken and probably some 360 ones too I can't think of right now but depending on where you pre-order it is the bonus you're going to get and the bonus has to do with the extra kart racers now if you decide to order from GameStop you will get Kratos from God of War which I'm sure is going to be a very popular one
3721790	3725852	We can also pre-order from Amazon, and you can get either Ratchet or Clank.
3725992	3729253	I don't know how that works, if you pick when you use the code or what happens.
3729614	3730694	Maybe you get both.
3731935	3733115	Maybe you do get both, I don't know.
3733435	3737337	And then Best Buy, you get Nathan Drake from Uncharted, which is actually pretty cool.
3737657	3739478	He looks like a me, honestly.
3739558	3741039	It looks like one of the Wii characters.
3741059	3746281	When you look at the little picture of Nathan Drake, honestly, it looks like a little me there, but that's what it is.
3747001	3748502	In my opinion...
3749696	3753159	I do love God of War, don't get me wrong, but I think the Uncharted guy is the coolest.
3753199	3755581	I think I would get it from Best Buy just to get Nathan Drake.
3757823	3766970	Now, I'm sure at some point they're all going to be microtransactions on the Sony marketplace anyway, but if you want to cut that corner, you can do the pre-order there.
3768591	3773735	By the way, also, you do get some type of mystery mod package when you pre-order the game.
3774156	3775197	You get pictures...
3776097	3796606	and you get other accessories to outfit your racer and uh yep you don't know exactly what stuff you're getting until you input the code it's like kind of one of those like mystery pins at Disneyland but that's what it is so could be interesting any interest in Mod Nation Racers you're gonna run out and get this game day one
3797122	3801127	I'm not sure, I have it on order, but I'm not sure if I'm going to pick it up right away.
3801587	3805491	It looks neat, but I just have a feeling it's not going to be as good as LittleBigPlanet.
3806533	3811578	And that's really, they're trying to get us to think that it's going to be LittleBigPlanet, you know, the kart racing game.
3814602	3817565	No, that's not what it's going to be, but it'll be pretty cool.
3818157	3818697	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3836167	3836728	Thanks for watching!
3851787	3852448	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3868268	3869729	I can't believe I forgot to mention that
3892182	3893464	Well, I have some codes.
3893944	3895366	Maybe I'll give those away later in the show.
3895426	3895706	I don't know.
3896287	3898629	Do any chatters want a blur beta code?
3898889	3900171	I'll give some away later if so.
3900471	3900952	We'll do that.
3901292	3901612	Why not?
3905177	3929753	SSJ100 Matt says the soundboard works great in blur because you know he has the soundboard with the Duke Nukem stuff and everything I don't know how he's doing it he's patching it through the 360 voice thing somehow and yeah he can play all these random things he's playing so if anyone in chat wants a blur beta code I'll give some away later maybe I'll give them away during list list because they sent me three others and I know at least I know Alan's gonna want one but I can give the other two away so I'll give those away to listeners why not
3931034	3933776	Oh, in the chat room saying, please, sure, yay.
3933956	3939041	Okay, I will give them away to random voters in our listless event later tonight, so stay tuned.
3939501	3939841	Stay tuned.
3940322	3941002	Okay, meanwhile...
3943194	3944654	Let's get into some, what, release dates?
3944694	3945655	Are we ready for release dates?
3945755	3946915	Alright, let's do release dates.
3947135	3957018	Alright, this week there's some decent stuff coming out, but let's start with some stuff that's not quite what you may be looking for, but hey, you've got people that you know that are kids and stuff, right?
3957899	3963400	Zuzu Pets, yes, the crazy thing that they were selling during the holiday that went like crazy.
3963940	3969322	Little pet hamsters now coming to Activision, or coming from Activision to the Nintendo DS.
3969802	3972243	In fact, you can actually snag one with a little baby hamster that
3973443	3976124	Blue and Yellow, that's one sick hamster.
3977484	3980445	How to Train Your Dragon, coming out, tying in with the new movie.
3980885	3986427	And that's going to be on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and I believe PSP.
3987427	3993429	Bakugan Battle Trainer, the sequel to the marble battling game, or I don't know.
3994229	4011785	that's going to be coming out to DS MotoGP 0910 I guess they're kind of combining years because they didn't have one come out last year that'll be coming out on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 Just Cause 2 coming out on PC, Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 this week looks like a pretty fun game
4012745	4029895	Red Steel 2 guaranteed to be better than the first one coming out on the Wii does require Wii Motion Plus so you can also pick up the Wii Motion Plus bundle for an extra $10 and save you like $9 off the cost of Wii Motion Plus if you don't have it
4031216	4036461	My Pet Chimp, coming out to Nintendo DS from 505 Games.
4036481	4042367	505 Games, I may add, was also the company that put out that really crappy baby game that I put on my Twitter.
4043228	4046291	You know, they may be a good candidate to hit up for the President Cat.
4046331	4047713	Yes, I retweeted that.
4047773	4049935	What the hell was that?
4050235	4052738	It's an actual baby doll thing or something, right?
4052898	4054058	That's the special edition.
4054139	4062402	Yes, you can buy it with a... It's basically a... It comes with a holster for your Wii that you attach to any baby doll.
4062422	4063582	But this one does come with a baby doll.
4063602	4064883	It looks like an umbilical cord.
4065383	4070505	And you play these little mini games like feeding the baby and whatnot.
4070805	4075887	It's just funny though because the baby doll that comes with the little special edition has like a lazy eye.
4076407	4077268	So it looks funny.
4079249	4081711	What happens if you shake the baby?
4082131	4083052	Not that you should do that.
4083072	4083732	That's not funny.
4084332	4084733	I don't know.
4084773	4096120	I don't know if you read the actual page or whatever, but he was tasked with putting powder on the baby and they told him to stop, but he kept doing it anyways, covering the baby in powder.
4096300	4096561	That's funny.
4096601	4099883	I think if you tried to play WarioWare with the baby peripheral, that might be a lot of fun.
4101730	4105611	No, what you need to do, though, is you use the baby peripheral with other games.
4105691	4106971	That's what he's saying.
4107051	4108751	Play WarioWare with the baby peripheral.
4109752	4109932	Aim.
4110512	4111012	A button.
4111552	4114933	Or like Wii Sports, like baseball or something like that.
4115733	4116393	You're bad.
4116833	4118013	That would be awesome.
4118853	4119834	Now there's a YouTube.
4119894	4122174	Now we need to find the baby game just to do that for YouTube.
4122734	4127515	And G Ditz in our chat room makes the mandatory South Park reference.
4127655	4128615	South Park reference.
4128695	4129496	Sorry, I'm eating too.
4129816	4130416	Kick the baby.
4132056	4145119	Uh, Cabela's Monster Bunk, er, Monster Bunk, yes, it's a giant bunk bed, no, Monster Buck Hunter, cause it's a deer hunting game, comes with a gun, oh yeah, perfect for the redneck in ya.
4146019	4152701	Um, Rooms, the first building, coming out from, uh, Konami on the Wii and DS.
4153681	4172737	Shimogami Tensei, Strange Journey, coming out on DS as well Disney's Stitch Jam, kind of a music platformer game, coming out also on the DS Settler 7, Paths to a Kingdom, coming out on PC from Ubisoft, yes with really crappy DRM
4173397	4175459	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4197676	4217794	and let's see this is an accessory though but the Nyko wand they're going to be doing the action pack you remember the Nyko wands like the third party controller that actually you can kind of move the buttons on it so you can plug it into this gun attachment it actually has a physical button for the trigger instead of like you know a trigger that pushes the B button on the bottom of the gun
4218914	4222556	and then coming out a week from now, America's Test Kitchen, Let's Get Cooking.
4222956	4231680	Coming from Nintendo, let's be honest here folks, this is really just them repackaging that stupid learn to cook game that they put out a couple years ago.
4231760	4233460	It looks exactly the same.
4234101	4234401	I don't know.
4235121	4241405	And then the better game of the two, WarioWare DIY will be coming out on Sunday.
4241785	4248229	And to go with those, the Nintendo DSi XL in bronze and burgundy.
4249710	4253573	Perfect for your Pokemon adventures and your little Pokeball walking trainer.
4253593	4256174	They should really just call it like bronze and Ron Burgundy.
4259484	4259925	Oh, boy.
4261066	4262588	Oh, how did I... Oh, wait.
4262829	4263269	No, never mind.
4263489	4264210	That comes out next week.
4265172	4266974	Or the week after next.
4267254	4267615	What does?
4267995	4268716	Oh, free running.
4268837	4269377	That's kind of neat.
4270138	4270999	What is free running?
4271180	4271841	Like parkour.
4272061	4272822	Like Mirror's Edge.
4273162	4273463	Oh, okay.
4273483	4273983	That's kind of cool.
4274184	4275025	Except not as cool.
4275748	4276488	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4297178	4302741	Another game coming out that does not look like a dating sim is Hokuto Musou comes out.
4302981	4306003	And this is a punch and kick type of game.
4307004	4308925	I don't know if they have this out in America.
4308945	4311586	I'm trying to think if there's a localized version of it.
4311606	4312627	I don't know.
4312667	4315188	For some reason, it looks very like Fist of the North Star-ish to me.
4315848	4316789	It's something Warriors.
4318050	4319010	Well, wait a second.
4319150	4319510	What is it?
4321031	4323732	Oh, yeah, it's the fifth North Star Dynasty Wars game.
4324312	4325053	Oh, yeah.
4325253	4325613	Gomi.
4326233	4327254	I actually identified that.
4328374	4332596	And let's see, what else is coming out on the PlayStation 3?
4332696	4338038	The God of War trilogy, as well as God of War 3, makes its way out to Japan as well.
4338118	4340479	So they get their versions not that long after we did.
4340999	4343420	And Hukotu Mosu also comes out over there.
4345061	4349444	Pachipada 15, Super Umi Monogatari in Okinawa 2
4364055	4365216	That is out on the PlayStation 3.
4366116	4370539	And on the Nintendo Wii, Silent Hill Shattered Memories gets its release in Japan.
4370879	4374941	So if you want to run and open doors and stuff, that is coming out on the Nintendo Wii.
4374982	4376582	It's also coming out on the PlayStation 2.
4378103	4387909	The Nintendo DS gets a bunch of a variety of different games this week, like some type of phonics game and a wrestling game, but nothing that really big that's worth talking about, to be honest.
4387929	4389370	But the Sony PSP gets...
4389850	4392051	Burst Error, Eve the First.
4392911	4394472	And I don't know what that game is.
4394532	4401955	That looks like a little... I guess... Oh, it's a sequel to a PC game from the mid-90s, Burst Error.
4402015	4402775	That's what this is.
4403275	4407177	And they've turned it into Chicks with Guns and Abnormally Large Boobies.
4407397	4407717	There you go.
4407737	4408817	Look at that screenshot right there.
4409337	4410318	Big, big boobies.
4411298	4415020	And also coming out on the Sony PSP, Prinny 2.
4416480	4439337	Toku Yugi, Akatsuki, NoPants, that's right, NoPants is in the title Daisaku NC, and I'm pretty sure that's I Wanna Be The King Part 2 Yes it is, Pretty 2 comes out this week Very nice Well joining us in studio just in time, say hello to DarkSakura, or you're muted, now you can roar What the heck you mute me for?
4439477	4444141	Well cause I didn't want the mic picking up sound when you weren't here I didn't want Shuri to jump up on your chair and go meh
4444381	4445921	Outro Music Outro Music
4470812	4472013	Oh, it was fantastic.
4472274	4474335	And I brought the metashevitz.
4474736	4474996	Alright.
4475016	4477058	It was like, we didn't tell anyone to bring the wine.
4477118	4477618	Bring the wine.
4477839	4478159	Okay.
4478419	4479760	Do you want to do UK release dates?
4480421	4481061	Yeah, I can.
4481142	4482483	Are you going to do UK release dates?
4482503	4483023	Because we're ready.
4483043	4483844	We're ready for you.
4483864	4485505	Look, I had everything up already.
4485565	4487387	You got here just in time for your first story.
4487407	4487988	How do you like that?
4488028	4488208	Look.
4488588	4492351	Because we didn't have you slated for anything earlier, but you got here just in time for your first story.
4492372	4493893	Did you want to talk about your gaming week real quick?
4494737	4495757	Um, Gaming Week?
4496777	4498578	I just assumed Star Trek Online and Peggle.
4498698	4499558	That's what I told the listeners.
4499578	4501378	Well, no, I didn't play Peggle at all, actually.
4502199	4509400	I did play Star Trek Online, and I was about to start Final Fantasy II, except, um, I think I got a phone call, because it was on my phone.
4509860	4509960	Oh.
4510840	4511420	I got it for iPhone.
4511440	4513041	Damn those phone calls interrupting your game.
4513321	4514181	I got it for iPhone.
4514981	4519242	And, um, and then Dan was playing Gauntlet.
4520652	4522833	Like, on the NES.
4523053	4523833	No, on the Genesis.
4523853	4524793	He was playing Genesis Gauntlet.
4525013	4525354	Awesome.
4525454	4526634	You missed it earlier in the show.
4526814	4529015	Alan and I played Double Dragon on the Xbox this week.
4529415	4532256	And we think it's like the most horrible arcade game in existence.
4532436	4534376	And one of those games just kind of sucks.
4534937	4536437	But Dan came in here and yelled at us.
4536457	4539098	Because he thinks Double Dragon's awesome.
4539790	4540250	He would.
4541691	4544253	Alright, UK release dates, DarkSakura, just in time.
4544513	4545214	What week is this?
4545474	4546955	The 21st through the 27th, huh?
4547796	4550677	Okay, on the 24th, Game Room, Xbox 360.
4550718	4554780	God, why do they keep changing the date?
4554820	4559023	BlazBlue, Calamity Trigger, Clash of the Titans, Echo Shift.
4559283	4560164	That's actually a cool name.
4560724	4566989	Infinite Space, Just Cause 2, Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver, whatever.
4567969	4568890	Well, you know, okay.
4572262	4573703	How different can they do a Pokemon game?
4574403	4576845	Because you have the walking trainer this time, but it's a Pokeball.
4576865	4577745	I had one of those.
4578546	4580447	I had one of those and that's all it was.
4580868	4582729	And it was yellow and it was in black and white.
4583680	4585360	But this one has Pokemans in it.
4585800	4587721	Mine had Pokemans in it.
4587741	4588121	That's right.
4588141	4591942	You grow your mudkips by walking around the block.
4592002	4593322	Mine had Pokeman in it.
4593442	4594282	It had Pikachu.
4597823	4598123	Where am I?
4598863	4599823	I would play the MMO though.
4600263	4602724	And there's Racket Sports Party.
4603444	4607005	I would play the Pokemon MMO and I would play Pokemon Snap 2 if they ever made it.
4607085	4608105	Would you play it in a box?
4608325	4609225	Would you play it with a fox?
4609445	4612386	I would play it on a train and I would play it in the rain.
4612406	4613286	Could you with a mouse?
4614459	4615880	Shut the fuck up and read the dates.
4616840	4634808	Resonance of Fate, Red Steel 2, Rugu Attack, Rugu Twisted Towers, Star Wars The Force Unleashed Ultimate Sith Edition, Die Siddler 7, Warriors Legends of Troy.
4634928	4636669	God, they're just putting everything right together.
4637349	4638689	I may as well do next week too.
4638749	4640110	Shoot, Grand Theft Auto 4 or whatever.
4641141	4641741	But again?
4641981	4643041	Or is that like a price reduction?
4643081	4644122	It's the Lost in the Damned thing.
4644242	4645002	Oh, gotcha.
4645862	4649383	By the way, our chat room jumping out here and screaming some corrections here.
4649443	4651323	Lama Juice, it's not new, it's gold and silver.
4651963	4653843	And Lama Juice says, the game is actually fun.
4654724	4657624	And DarkTetsuya says, your Pokemans, please show us them.
4657944	4660245	AlphaKineticGram says, gold kicked ass.
4660405	4661105	Gold kicked ass.
4661465	4663265	I thought Pearl was fun until I stopped going to the gym.
4663545	4667126	Spike McRu says, yeah, but gold and silver were the best, let's be honest.
4668214	4669154	No, no, no.
4669194	4671855	The pinnacle is Pokemon Snap.
4672856	4675957	There's this gal on my Twitter friends list and I don't know her real well.
4676017	4679958	I think she runs Gaming Angels, I want to say is the name of the site.
4680158	4680878	I hope I got that right.
4681778	4685380	And she made this tweet that I just found hilarious because I kind of could see myself.
4685760	4690661	She said something like, I'm in line right now waiting to get the new Pokemon game.
4690701	4691862	Yeah, I'm 33 years old.
4692022	4692282	What?
4692302	4692522	What?
4694921	4698766	And I'm like, oh, that must be awkward to be in the midnight launch line for Pokemon.
4700508	4702930	My Pokemans let you not show them to me.
4703091	4706274	But I gotta say, there's quite a few people I know that are playing the new Pokemon game.
4706474	4709598	I almost, almost want to get it.
4710139	4711941	But I'm afraid if I do, Alan will break up with me.
4712141	4713082	Like, he's like, no, I can't.
4713122	4714343	If you do, I'll disown you, Rob.
4716457	4718337	Alan, would you break up with me if I got the Pokemon game?
4718417	4720078	I have nothing against Pokemon.
4720158	4720418	Really?
4720438	4721958	Do you want to play Pokemon together?
4722278	4726019	We'll both get the game and then run around the block and evolve our Pokemon.
4726079	4727819	Rob, you're such a five-year-old girl.
4730000	4730480	I'm just kidding.
4730500	4731000	I'm not going to get it.
4732020	4737641	Oh, but Spyro and Chat, oh, and Ionotropic I should give credit to first, jump in and say Pokemon Pinball rules all.
4738121	4739522	Abso-fucking-lutely.
4740042	4741522	That was an amazing game.
4741962	4742762	A++.
4742842	4743663	I will sign off on that.
4743683	4745383	Still burning from the damn horseradish.
4745942	4747802	It's also really kind of hot in the studio right now.
4747862	4752123	You know, I've got this thing that I used to tie the curtains back with, Rob, so you can actually have airflow.
4752163	4752423	Hi.
4752523	4755644	By the way, I was going to ask you when you got here, were you able to do the orange scarf after all?
4755984	4757284	Or did that not finish?
4757304	4758084	No.
4758344	4759764	I've had no time.
4759784	4760404	No, I understand.
4760504	4760945	I understand.
4761125	4767146	I just want to, before I talk about PAX East and Part B, I want to make sure I have... I'll try to get this monstrosity finished.
4767286	4771726	Well, I leave on Tuesday night, so... I'm good.
4771746	4772366	Oh, alright.
4772487	4774107	I don't think I can get it done.
4774127	4774967	I'll ship it to you.
4775467	4775727	All right.
4776507	4780029	Anyhow, let's move on with some more crash, bang, boom.
4780069	4781649	There's chaos going on in the studio.
4781989	4783170	Let's get back to some gaming news.
4783370	4786171	We have a couple more stories than the classic game of the week, Loki.
4786751	4787491	Yeah.
4787591	4797234	So with Game Room coming out very soon, actually, it's interesting to find out that there's actually going to be some achievements tied in with Game Room.
4797294	4801996	I thought that they were just going to be tied in with actual games, but apparently it's Game Room.
4802736	4808239	There's going to be 1,000 achievement points to be had and 56 achievements altogether.
4808679	4812321	Apparently, you get points every three medals that you earn.
4813441	4819744	There's even some points, I guess, for spending time in the arcade, 36 hours total.
4821645	4823006	Interesting that they have that.
4826187	4826447	I don't know.
4826467	4828048	What do you think about achievements in Game Room?
4828834	4829455	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4844950	4848473	The game is Game Room, it's just the classic games are the songs.
4848513	4850174	They're the microtransaction.
4850594	4858880	It does seem like, though, if you actually read through the list of achievements, most of them are driven by the medals that you win from playing the classic games.
4859321	4862483	So you're still going to have to have a variety of classic games in order to get all the achievements.
4862823	4866106	But I think it's pretty cool that they allowed them to bump it up to 1,000.
4866646	4868988	I mean, you're looking at a full game.
4869748	4872991	Honestly, it's just kind of a different type of method of getting it out there.
4873203	4886672	Definitely, and like some of the achievements in there, they have achievements for themes, like place a theme in your arcade, they have one for placing five unique themes in your arcade, theme your entire arcade with unique themes, your mascots, props, visitors.
4886732	4893697	It seems like some of those are really easy achievements, unless you have to do something to earn those decorations.
4893937	4897800	Well, the decorations, the thing that worries me about the decorations is you have to buy those.
4898841	4901983	Well, didn't they say that some you would get for buying the game on release day?
4902003	4902183	Maybe.
4903973	4907474	But still it's buying something You know what I mean?
4908375	4910115	I do Am I buying achievement points?
4913076	4933063	In a way you are If you don't buy any games for Game Room You can't get those medal based achievements Well I take it back You could do it using the quarter method But you're going to have to spend money one way or the other I'll check it out It'll be interesting to see I don't know how much I'm really going to play of it though
4933672	4935593	I'm not going to lie, I'm super excited about Game Room.
4935613	4938975	I'm all about the classic games, but remember, I do have a couple rules.
4939135	4943898	My number one rule is, I will not buy a game that they've already released on Xbox Live Arcade.
4944258	4948361	So don't be looking for me in Scramble or Tempest, because I already have those games.
4948421	4950422	I'm not buying them in Game Room.
4950462	4951603	I don't care how pretty it is.
4953024	4957306	Anyhow, one more story for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week.
4957326	4960748	And this has to do with something I actually mentioned during the release dates a couple weeks ago.
4960828	4961848	Actually, I think it was last week.
4962329	4965991	On the PlayStation 3 this week, they released in Japan something called Torn.
4966411	4967091	Well, guess what?
4967171	4974615	Apparently, Famitsu is reporting that shops in Japan are selling out of this, the standalone version of the Torn DVR peripheral.
4975215	4976216	Thanks for watching!
4995166	4995667	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5012745	5020609	but think about how cool it would be if they would just release that freaking thing over here imagine if they released TiVo for your Playstation 3 would you buy it?
5020830	5035838	I would, absolutely I don't have DVR on Comcast because I don't think the DVR that Comcast offers is that great to be honest I like how TiVo will do the recommended shows and all that stuff too and the DVR on Comcast is kind of clunky for me
5036132	5037253	I have something that does that.
5037793	5040415	It's called the internet and downloading.
5041856	5042657	I know, I know.
5043798	5050943	I'm actually ready to cancel our cable and get a different internet provider because Dan sometimes watches TV but we hooked up a computer in the front room and watched Hulu.
5051801	5055484	I have a decent rate going on right now.
5055524	5060707	I have a special, but I seriously think when the six months is over, I'm going to just cancel the TV.
5060867	5062028	I don't ever watch it.
5062648	5067271	He watched Casino Royale today for a couple minutes while I was getting ready for the show tonight.
5067312	5069873	That's the most TV we've watched at all.
5070013	5071494	We do nothing but watch Hulu now.
5071574	5072995	I watch Drag Race online.
5073015	5074036	That's the only show I watch.
5074456	5080480	We'll watch a DVD or something, but really almost anything you can just find online and network.
5083002	5083282	What?
5085224	5085784	What's that, Mystique?
5085804	5086825	You gotta say that on the mic.
5087425	5088426	Everybody say hi to Mystique.
5088446	5092149	I haven't watched Transformy, but I have seen Untucked.
5099139	5103362	Link, were they Undo Plastic Surgery or something?
5103402	5111349	No, no, Untucked is like the behind the scenes at RuPaul's Drag Race and you can really see who is nice and who is naughty.
5111369	5114631	And did you know one of my favorite drag queens this season was Mystique?
5115231	5116793	I know, isn't it awesome?
5116853	5118414	I was a drag queen, I was so excited.
5118434	5122717	I was like, oh my god, my name is awesome because I'm a drag queen.
5123338	5124158	And a porn star.
5124519	5125820	Exactly, I have arrived.
5126932	5130914	How many people can say they have a name in common with a porn star and a drag queen?
5131634	5132334	And a car.
5132475	5134375	I'm changing my name to Pandora Box.
5134415	5134776	That's it.
5134816	5136316	That's what I'm going to have to do.
5138217	5139618	So, moving forward.
5143259	5146841	Bet you didn't know when you subscribed to this show on iTunes you'd be getting drag queen chat.
5146941	5150703	Everyone just wait until I put up the pictures of Rob and Frank here.
5150783	5151383	I'm telling you.
5151443	5151963	I'm telling you.
5152684	5155445	You do look good in a corset and lingerie.
5156198	5165881	Maybe they'll find out at PAX East But here's the thing Seriously, if they can do a Project Runway video game on the Wii Why can't they do a RuPaul's Drag Race video game on the Wii?
5166562	5167082	Why not?
5167202	5182747	That would be amazing Because you would have RuPaul on your TV going, you know And may the best woman win And don't F it up And don't beep it up Alright
5186323	5190666	Because I want my own drag queen, that's why I would like to collect drag queens for myself
5210863	5213645	Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta primp them all.
5213725	5214486	Gotta primp them all.
5214646	5215987	Exactly, gotta catch them all.
5216207	5217208	Pokey Queen, alright.
5219210	5222453	No, no, instead of, what was it, Nito, can you be Nito Queen?
5224778	5226159	DarkSakura goes in the vault and...
5252697	5253137	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5279454	5279934	Why, thank you.
5282815	5284416	This was a game, actually, in Japan.
5284496	5286336	It was called Berserk Millennium Falcon.
5286356	5289918	Which was based off of... Actually, you should hear...
5294224	5295446	No, but I've seen a nice bush.
5295706	5300453	But you should hear, the voice actor for Gutsu in this was Michael Bell.
5300513	5304859	Did a lot of Transformers, Voltron.
5304899	5309766	This is the English dub, which is kind of... Listen to this.
5312051	5313032	It's a Mandragora.
5314313	5315734	I love the American voice acting, though.
5316274	5321198	Because you know who they got to do Casca's voice was BJ Ward, who was Princess Allura on Voltron.
5322198	5324920	I was like, these are voices that I know from my youth.
5324940	5326701	So this game was like, that's so cool.
5326762	5330264	And also my favorite Japanese voice actor was Gatsu's voice in Japanese version.
5330344	5331785	Is this like a Silent Hill kind of game?
5331865	5332185	No.
5332366	5332626	Okay.
5333987	5336509	Let me get back to what I was telling you.
5336810	5341694	Berserk is a dark fantasy manga in Japan.
5342275	5343296	It's very graphic.
5344497	5345218	Very graphic.
5346904	5351528	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5365541	5368182	So anyway, it's based off of a manga.
5370423	5374946	And it's set, for anyone who is a fan of Berserk, I've read a whole bunch of the manga.
5375366	5378107	It's set between volume 22 and 23 of the manga.
5378567	5380248	So it's set after the anime series.
5381269	5383950	The anime was, I think, a 26 episode series.
5385691	5391454	And the anime followed the first arc of the manga, which was the whole Takanodon thing.
5392035	5394745	Everybody in chat by the way is saying Dark is an understatement.
5394966	5396511	Dark is totally an understatement.
5397475	5397916	It's like...
5400766	5403708	It makes Tarantino movies look like Cartoon Network.
5403768	5409470	There's like this whole scene in the manga where they go into this cave and there is like an orgy of the thousands.
5410231	5412432	No, a graphic orgy of the thousands.
5412552	5414073	Cool, blood orgy.
5414293	5419035	Oh, and then when they get to the place where they're doing the Inquisition and we're talking about old school torture devices.
5419915	5420516	Pretty vicious.
5420556	5421996	Is it a Spanish Inquisition?
5422397	5426879	It makes the Spanish Inquisition look like a puppet show.
5429284	5432127	Misty's back there going, nobody expects a Spanish Inquisition!
5433329	5436092	What in the hell did... Where did my show go?
5436172	5437093	Has anyone seen it?
5437314	5438215	Is it under the chair?
5438475	5440718	That's because Misty walked into the room and she derails everything.
5442591	5444492	But this particular one was on the Dreamcast.
5444692	5449295	There's another one that came out on PS2, but I don't count it because, really, I like the Japanese one.
5449655	5450956	Well, the Dreamcast one.
5451436	5453157	I do have the Japanese version of this game.
5453938	5455599	And I got it just for the voice acting.
5456479	5461682	Because they got the same people from the anime.
5462063	5466465	Like, Hayashi Nobutoshi does Gatsu's voice, and same everybody.
5466745	5469227	Except for, of course, all the ones who died violently at the end of the series.
5472298	5478545	Shaoran in our chatroom says, Everyone dies, the world ends, and people burn in hell forever is a happy ending compared to Berserk.
5479246	5479906	Yeah, pretty much.
5480607	5481488	Okay, okay.
5482369	5489717	I'm going to give the background, and if you haven't seen the anime, spoiler, turn off your station for a little bit, or fast forward or whatever.
5491388	5492869	The whole thing starts off with Gatsu as a boy.
5493769	5503633	And he goes off and joins a mercenary group and he meets this chick named Casca who is the second in command under this guy named Griffith who is totally pretty and has this weird egg that he wears.
5503673	5507515	It has two eyes, a nose, and a mouth but all spread in different areas.
5507575	5508575	Anyway, stuff goes on.
5508895	5512757	Griffith turns out to be the next in line to be, well, an evil god.
5513477	5518099	And sacrifices the entire group in this big bloody feast.
5520061	5520602	Yay!
5520682	5522585	Blood Feast!
5522926	5532342	I'm not going to go into it, but as the manga starts continuing from there, Gatsu and Kasuka have a mark on them that means they're followed by demons because they were intended to be part of the sacrifice, but they escaped.
5532782	5535845	There are similarities between that and Final Fantasy XIII, I just want to say.
5536526	5537386	Oh no.
5537406	5537667	No.
5537947	5538547	There's nothing.
5539548	5539969	Nothing.
5540910	5544353	Which is a bummer because I wish Vanille was in the game Jamie's talking about.
5544453	5546194	That's the only bummer.
5546375	5546935	Can I finish?
5546975	5547756	Yes, you can finish.
5548477	5554862	So anyway, this is a side story, but from what I understand, it is considered part of the canon.
5555903	5556284	And so...
5558277	5567679	Gatsu, somewhere in the manga, this little elf starts following Gatsu around called Puck, who's really more like a weird little chubby fairy with blue hair.
5568719	5570080	What'd you call me?
5571660	5572520	A blue chubby fairy.
5573500	5580302	Anyway, the whole point is that Casca, from her ordeal, because she had a bad time,
5580902	5582023	Sounds like Vone.
5608022	5616584	So anyway, it's them getting all caught up in this one thing because the main bad guy, his wife, has the same problem that Casper does, but it's a long story.
5617184	5617864	I'm not getting onto it.
5617985	5619225	It's really a game worth playing.
5619245	5620405	It really is a game worth playing.
5620445	5621085	It's really fun.
5622646	5628407	So, of course, it ends gruesome, just like anything related to Berserk ends.
5632088	5634729	But it's just really, really a fun game.
5635029	5635109	Um...
5636943	5643191	And like I said, there was another version that came out on PlayStation 2.
5646415	5647577	There's also the soundtrack.
5647597	5651722	Now, what's really cool about this is... Let me hear the music for a second.
5655618	5657159	You can find one on there that's Forces 2.
5658239	5668523	Forces was the opening theme song to the anime and the guy who did the soundtrack for the anime and the opening theme and everything did all the music in the game.
5669163	5671244	And he did a special version of the opening song.
5680026	5683291	So he did a special version of the opening theme.
5683972	5693665	So it really, this is actually, I think, one of the best tie-ins because you don't really have to, I mean, if you've been keeping up with the series, you don't really have to guess about where it's gone, where the specific...
5706667	5711369	This is actually one of my favorite pieces of music ever.
5714951	5715271	What?
5718793	5721735	Everybody from the living room keeps coming in here to derail the show.
5721815	5724276	Dan is just waving chicken around.
5724316	5726157	Dan, tell everyone how awesome this game is.
5727045	5727365	He left.
5727745	5728066	He left.
5728106	5728646	He had chicken.
5728926	5729406	Butthead!
5730687	5731067	Berserk.
5731748	5732188	Chicken.
5735790	5736671	I'm disowning you.
5737311	5740853	PETA would tell you that what happens to chickens is something like this Berserk game.
5741734	5742034	Yeah.
5743935	5746797	But, at any rate, oh, here he is.
5746917	5748378	Next time you have a Chicken McNugget, just think of Berserk.
5748398	5752801	Jamie always gets mad at me because I go to the store, I buy lunch meat, and I don't buy what she likes.
5753621	5755662	Well, this time I want... What the fuck?
5755702	5756523	What the fuck?
5757591	5758753	Bitch, you are eating that chicken.
5760355	5761176	Or I'll give it to Eric.
5762738	5763118	Joker.
5764480	5764800	Yes!
5766943	5767844	Berserk.
5767885	5769687	We do a show here, it's about video games.
5770168	5771870	The one that was on Dreamcast?
5771910	5773312	That game was hard as nails.
5775290	5782576	It was, like, you get to Nosferatu Zod, and he's like, by the way, I know you thought you were good at 3D action games, but you suck.
5783257	5788001	And he'll kill you, and kill you, and kill you, and kill you, until you finally man up enough to beat him.
5788501	5790743	Then the rest of the game is fucking harder than hell.
5792685	5792945	Yes.
5793785	5794966	And the story's a little bit dark?
5795927	5797629	No, no, Berserk's all bright and airy.
5798930	5799951	It's very similar to the Unicorn game.
5799971	5802152	You know, it's a story of rape and insanity.
5804065	5805326	And that's just the backstory.
5805346	5808728	See, if they had called the game Rape and Insanity, it would have sold more.
5808788	5811550	But Berserk, everybody thinks that's a game with a bouncing happy face.
5811911	5812171	No, no, no.
5812191	5812811	In an electric maze.
5812931	5813972	It's spelled differently.
5814973	5816394	That's spelled with a Z. Oh, okay.
5816614	5817294	And it has evil auto.
5817454	5819116	Also, hard as nails.
5820837	5821277	Anything else?
5822618	5822898	Chicken.
5823218	5823539	Chicken.
5827367	5828207	Dan was actually right.
5828227	5829688	That's pretty much how the series ends.
5832069	5833510	I have a Laserdisc.
5834470	5835651	Now, I liked Berserk.
5836251	5836811	That's very cool.
5836831	5844114	You have your Mr. J. Anyway, Berserk was a series that I was so into.
5844854	5846515	I loved the anime.
5847396	5848236	Piss off!
5850459	5852240	I apologize to the listeners.
5852440	5854601	There's just insanity going on in the studio tonight.
5856082	5860724	It's like our show has the red ring of death tonight because it's the 360th episode.
5860784	5862124	So congratulations.
5862564	5864145	Dan, you broke the show tonight.
5865866	5866526	Five gamerscore.
5867547	5870328	Yeah, well I got your chicken right here.
5873225	5874607	Dan goes, no, it's in the fridge.
5875307	5883173	Anyway, yeah, when Dan says that the backstory for this game is rape and insanity, he means that literally.
5884194	5886416	Seriously, that's how the TV series ends.
5886636	5887737	That's why Costco's fucked up.
5888778	5899066	So it was a really, you know what, I have to say, I was surprised that the game came over here because the anime hadn't been out over here
5899386	5900867	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5924145	5930249	And then I watched some of the anime and decided to get the Japanese version because I really love dude's voice.
5930890	5933131	Hayashi Nobutoshi is like my favorite voice actor ever.
5933612	5936814	For anyone who watched Fushigi Yugi, he did Toski's voice acting.
5937595	5939896	And Basara in Macross 7.
5940356	5942818	Not the singing, although he's got an amazing singing voice.
5943499	5945520	But that's examples.
5946080	5952085	Oh, and he also was... Who was the dude in Pokemon who had the Earth-based... Brock?
5952305	5952465	Yeah.
5952485	5952565	Yeah.
5954124	5954826	Sano's voice was him.
5962522	5964884	Sanosuke in Rurouni Kitchen.
5964924	5965384	Anyway, I'm sorry.
5965605	5966765	I'm getting my voice actors mixed up.
5966786	5967046	Sorry.
5967586	5967986	But yeah.
5969167	5969928	I'm sorry.
5969968	5970468	I'm wired.
5970869	5971709	You gave me chocolate.
5971749	5971969	I'm wired.
5971989	5972470	No, that's okay.
5973030	5974972	This classic game of the Wii game has been going on for 20 minutes.
5975052	5977494	Is there anything else you want to say about the classic game?
5977514	5979535	Play the damn game.
5979695	5981216	Or she will talk more about it.
5981377	5986420	But I do warn you, if you have any kind of traumatic memories, never read the manga.
5986440	5986540	Okay.
5987421	5987981	DarkSakura.com
6016205	6017726	It doesn't count Sega.
6017786	6020007	It counts Dreamcast.
6021347	6022428	I have done a lot of Sega games.
6023328	6023628	Sega!
6024269	6026069	Can we do a break now?
6026409	6027030	I guess.
6027050	6028110	We're going to break stuff.
6028130	6028370	Chicken!
6032893	6033253	Help.
6034394	6036175	If you're in the Sacramento area, please send help.
6036415	6038916	We're located at Jamie's house, Studio DarkSakura.
6038956	6039797	The address is... No.
6040517	6043479	We're going to go to our break here, but don't go anywhere.
6043539	6045160	We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6045180	6046140	Yes, there's more to come.
6046620	6048882	Part A was one hour and 45 minutes tonight.
6048922	6050663	Will we surpass that with Part B?
6050923	6051543	I don't know.
6051943	6052604	But we'll be here.
6053344	6054445	We're going to do Mailbag.
6054485	6057726	We have Listless coming up tonight, a special 360 topic.
6057746	6059527	I'm going to talk about PAX East when we come back.
6059968	6060488	Plenty more.
6060808	6065006	Don't go anywhere, we'll be right back in just a minute with more of Orange Lounge Radio
6071024	6080491	And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday, March the 21st of 2010 where we are taping episode number 360 of our show.
6080551	6081972	That's right, like an Xbox 360.
6082032	6083653	It just happens to be that episode tonight.
6084174	6087877	And so tonight we're going to do a listless, an old OLR favorite game show.
6087897	6090098	We're going to get into that a little bit later tonight.
6091119	6094281	And the topic tonight, I will tell you now, the topic tonight so you can be thinking about it.
6094942	6097524	We want to do something Microsoft inspired since it's episode 360.
6098084	6100026	So what is Microsoft really good at?
6100666	6109868	Stealing other people's ideas and making them better So, tonight's list list is What great idea should Microsoft steal next?
6110728	6127331	So, or the idea that Microsoft should steal and make better next So, we will get into list list, and if you don't know how that works, stay tuned Also, with tonight's list list, you will be able to place your votes And if you want, I have two blur beta codes, speaking of the 360, to give away to random voters
6127711	6130912	So if you want the code tonight, stay tuned and vote in listless.
6130972	6134213	I will explain how that all works a little later on.
6135094	6137535	But first, we have some rapid-fire news.
6137595	6141816	Although I did want to say before we get into the news, sorry, I do want to mention PAX East is coming up this weekend.
6141856	6146118	And I am going to PAX East, and I do not believe there is an OLR next week because of it.
6146438	6148859	No, there's a NAPLR.
6150474	6155237	There will not be a live show next week.
6155378	6162943	However, I will be recording stuff, but it will only be posted to the Twitter and Facebook and our online communities.
6163003	6164644	It will not go to the podcast feed.
6165004	6166085	So you've got to stay tuned.
6166105	6171929	If you're a member of our social networks, be at Twitter.com slash OLR, Facebook, Orange Lounge Radio, or...
6172990	6173571	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6188208	6217023	I want to plug his panel at PAX East and if you're going to PAX East I'm going to be here for sure it'll be at the Naga Theater Friday at 5pm it's the Organizing a Child's Play Fundraiser panel and my buddy Seg he helped put together Umlaut which happened in San Francisco you might remember we were talking about that earlier so he'll be at that panel so absolutely I have to go as well so I'll be there I'll also be around the show floor keep an eye on the Twitter twitter.com slash OLR and I'll let you know where I will be at okay

6220884	6226765	I don't know what I'm wearing yet, though, but I'll post pictures or something on twitter.com slash OLR.
6227885	6229466	Okay, now we're ready for some news.
6230006	6231666	Loki, let's do some rapid, quick, quick news.
6231966	6241268	Yes, so let's start off with the release date for Crackdown 2, which is now being put into one of the most dead months of the year, July.
6242028	6245709	Yes, it'll be coming out July 6th, and boy, does it look awesome.
6246689	6251932	The game will be releasing in North America on July 6th with Asia, Australia, and New Zealand following on July 8th.
6252452	6254373	In Europe following on July 9th.
6254573	6259335	No word on exactly when Japan will be receiving the game or any of the Asian regions.
6261036	6262737	But yeah, it looks all sorts of awesome.
6264317	6276366	One thing that was supposed to not be coming out over here apparently is Batman Arkham Asylum the game of the year edition will indeed be coming out over in North America and will also feature 3D support as well.
6277147	6291777	Originally they announced that the 3D would be done in a way that wouldn't alter the colors however I see now in the picture that they have the kind of purple and green glasses so apparently it's just going to be the standard 3D stuff and
6292097	6293098	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6315110	6322574	and a voucher for some unidentified movie download as well as an exclusive in-game item for Peace Walker.
6322594	6325596	Could it possibly be Metal Gear or espionage related, the movie?
6325696	6326556	I'll just call it a hunch.
6327957	6328337	I don't know.
6328357	6328598	Just a guess.
6328678	6328998	I don't know.
6329398	6330739	They don't have a Metal Gear movie.
6331339	6333640	Well, you know, it could be an anime or something right now.
6333660	6334521	I guess there isn't one, is there?
6334541	6335241	I don't know.
6335261	6336542	It'll probably be something like James Bond.
6336582	6338003	It'll be Quantum of Solace or something.
6338203	6339363	You know, something close.
6340124	6340384	Maybe.
6341284	6343185	And that, of course, will be coming out for $200.
6343265	6343426	Yeah.
6345373	6347135	Final Fight Double Impact Magic Sword
6366457	6370098	Well, it is coming April 14th and 15th, depending on which store you want.
6370458	6373239	Xbox Live gets it on the 14th, and PlayStation Store gets it the same way.
6373259	6375700	I'm disappointed that Captain Commando is not part of that.
6376300	6379341	No, but it's weird, because it's Final Fight and Magic Sword.
6379381	6380782	I can't think of more different games.
6380822	6382062	They're running on the same engine.
6382122	6384683	I know, but they're still completely different games, Loki.
6384743	6386323	They have nothing in common.
6386543	6387564	Yes, it's the same engine.
6387804	6388764	Well, two games to the price of one.
6388784	6389604	That's the way I look at it.
6389664	6390225	That's fine.
6390445	6390965	That's fine.
6391445	6392147	So I'm looking forward to it.
6392187	6400141	If not for nothing else, for me, it's Magic Sword featuring Final Fight because I hate how Magic Sword is being understated in this release.
6400722	6401163	I don't know why.
6401203	6401704	It bugs me.
6401904	6402405	I'm just weird.
6403393	6404974	Would you like to buy my namesake?
6405074	6405554	That's right.
6405574	6407116	You can buy an R.O.B.
6407336	6407736	Robot.
6407776	6411098	The Rob the Robot you can buy for the Nintendo Entertainment System.
6411418	6412419	Except it will set you back only $4,150.
6412739	6414941	That's right.
6415001	6416722	It just sold on an eBay auction this week.
6416802	6417843	But here's the deal, guys.
6417903	6419464	It was like pristine in a case.
6419484	6422146	It looks like one of those sales cases that they actually used to have in the store.
6422266	6422866	I remember those.
6423086	6424007	Yeah, I remember those too.
6424107	6429711	So somebody actually bought that with the Nintendo System, the controllers, the gun, all that stuff.
6429731	6429711	$4,150.
6429831	6433093	I don't know if they remembered, but it wasn't that good.
6433733	6436836	I don't know if you ever actually played the Rob the Robot, but it was kind of annoying.
6436856	6440040	I wanted to get one for my desk, and trust me, they're a lot cheaper than $4,000.
6440080	6442883	I mean, you could get them way cheaper.
6442903	6444184	Well, yeah, these are in pristine condition.
6444224	6446326	Ah, who cares?
6446386	6453894	I gotta say, in the display box and everything's pretty cool, but it's weird to think that that was sitting in some store that probably got sent it for free.
6453934	6454174	But yeah...
6454654	6457198	If you've never played the Rob the Robot before, it was really weird.
6457238	6468875	It had these little gyro things that would spin, and then you would have to move them onto a thing that would push down the button on your controller, but then they would start to lose speed, so you'd have to pick them up and rev them up again.
6468895	6469817	It was kind of annoying.
6470512	6477078	Yeah, the NES that I got was, I think I got a NES when I was little within the first month of it coming out, so I got the ROB system.
6478299	6480361	It really wasn't fun at all, and it was loud.
6481062	6484205	It was so loud, the sound of it, you know, spinning up the things.
6484505	6487468	My friend had one of these, and I remember we tried to play it once, and it was a little ridiculous.
6487608	6487828	Yeah.
6488068	6488269	Yeah.
6489049	6490209	So, not worth $41.50?
6490330	6490610	No.
6490630	6491110	Okay.
6492870	6494651	Alright, and one other story for you guys.
6495031	6500693	Pac-Man Battle Royale, we talked about it a couple weeks on the show, saying it had the worst teaser trailer ever because it didn't say anything about the game.
6501213	6503594	Now we finally know some things about the game.
6503654	6510376	A video has hit the internet from the Amusement Expo that finally shows a little bit about what we can see in this game.
6510456	6512237	And we see some folks playing the game in this video.
6512837	6521484	And basically it looks like a little bit of a mixture between Pac-Man Championship Edition, it kind of has those little graphics, and a little bit of Pac-Man Versus elements.
6521784	6522665	But here's the deal.
6523425	6527409	In Pac-Man Versus, the other players are playing as ghosts, but that's not what's happening here.
6527949	6530171	Everybody is playing as different Pac-Mans.
6530751	6534674	But Pac-Man can eat the other Pac-Mans with a specific power-up.
6535115	6538998	And here's the coolest part of all, it's a cocktail cabinet.
6539298	6540158	So it's a table.
6541139	6542460	That's the cabinet they're playing it on.
6542480	6543440	It's one of those old cocktail cabinets.
6543460	6544760	But you know what the lamest part about it is?
6544860	6545000	What?
6545021	6546421	Eating the dots doesn't give you any points.
6546701	6550062	There's no points in the game other than eating the other players or being the last one to survive.
6550102	6553203	I would imagine eating the dots is how you power up.
6553964	6559466	It's basically how you... Eating the dots is basically how you trigger more dots to appear and more power-ups to appear.
6559766	6561146	Did you grow like Super Pac-Man?
6561306	6561667	Yes, you do.
6561927	6562627	That is beautiful.
6563027	6565088	Pac-Man Pac-Man Pac-Man Pac-Man Pac-Man
6591324	6594828	If Pac-Man is his species, then Pac-Man would be proper.
6596030	6596971	Just checking.
6597471	6598032	Nope, don't care.
6598652	6600254	I'm just kidding.
6600635	6600915	Fine.
6602837	6603678	So yeah, bite me.

6681624	6683386	X-Pack, number one.
6683827	6685809	This is Rock Band download content.
6686350	6692999	There's Blue Spark, The Hungry Wolf, I Must Not Think Bad Thoughts, and Los Angeles.
6693450	6696592	I'd take Hungry Like the Wolf, but that's not this.
6696632	6697733	I'll take Kick Your Butt.
6699194	6704078	Individual tracks is Little Fish, Am I Crazy, Big Bang, and Darling Deer.
6705198	6709962	Ace Frehley, wasn't that the guitarist for Kiss?
6710162	6711503	Yeah, Ace Frehley was the guitarist for Kiss.
6711523	6713904	I didn't know he was doing stuff on his own anymore.
6714585	6719669	Outer Space, Carrie Underwood, All-American Girl, Snore, One Republic, Stop and Stare.
6720089	6721890	It's also, of course, available for Lego Rock Band.
6722230	6722971	Oh, Ryan Tedder.
6725009	6727812	and 32X Anniversary!
6728372	6729494	Yay!
6731796	6740406	There is the 32X Anniversary album Sega is going to be putting out that will have all of the tracks released.
6740566	6747869	from Space Harrier, Stellar Assault, Virtua Racing Deluxe, oh lord, Parasquad, Metalhead, and Virtua Fighter.
6748389	6750570	Exactly the way they were on the 32X.
6750630	6759314	And it will be released through Wave Master, Sega's label, on March 31st for 3,625 yen, about 40 bucks.
6762055	6765377	But you can just get 32X in all the games for a lot less than that.
6766117	6767038	I have a 32X.
6767958	6769879	The Great Space Mushroom.
6771463	6773084	Why is there no Calibri soundtrack on here?
6774284	6774604	I don't know.
6774824	6776004	Maybe it's like a hidden track.
6776044	6776565	Maybe it's a hidden track.
6776605	6779286	Why is there no Knuckles Chaotix on here?
6779566	6779906	I don't know.
6780386	6780986	That game was cool.
6781186	6783127	I don't know.
6783287	6786948	However, I do love Space Harrier on 32X because it is the arcade version.
6788359	6789099	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6806730	6807130	Thanks for watching!
6827202	6834965	Okay, but first some Twitter topics, and I was not a good host tonight and forgot to remind people to post their Twitter topics, but that's okay.
6835605	6842587	Like, I don't want the segment to be that long tonight because we have Listless tonight, and now we have an interview in Part B, so yeah, we got to hurry, hurry.
6843277	6854546	Alright, let's see, starting off with TigerClaw305, linking us to a story about how McDonald's uses the DS to train part-time workers.
6855026	6856748	It's a DS-based training.
6857128	6862152	Now, keep in mind, this isn't something that's happening in America, but it's something that's working with McDonald's Japan.
6862492	6866513	They actually use the DS as a training tool using a training program called eSmart.
6866993	6869714	So a part-time employee will train through the software.
6870714	6873335	It's going to be used in 3,700 stores all around Japan.
6874135	6876956	And the program's cost is about 200 million yen.
6877096	6880377	Not that somebody actually has to pay that, but that's how much it costs to develop and everything.
6880797	6884318	McDonald's thinks it can cut the training time by over half.
6885258	6892420	by using this new system because lots of people already know how to use the DS and they want to get employees quickly out on the floor.
6892900	6893600	Kind of interesting.
6894200	6897841	I got to admit, my day job, if you didn't know, has to do with training.
6897881	6899161	I train for a big corporation.
6899741	6903442	Not McDonald's, but a different corporation.
6904122	6906082	I'm always interested in these types of new training tools.
6908283	6914444	I guess if you can make sure that employees are comprehending the information given and it's a fun, interactive way to learn...
6914724	6914904	Blue Swim
6926786	6932849	Twitter question, did you guys take advantage of Kmart's $10 off $20 plus coupon overnight?
6932909	6939392	Apparently, there was an online coupon for its NYC stores that wasn't region locked, allowing people everywhere to use it.
6940072	6944854	No, I hadn't heard and it would be really hard to get me to set foot in a Kmart anyway.
6945649	6946650	I guess it came right around the corner.
6946790	6949772	But, you know, free money is a pretty good way to do it, I gotta say.
6950032	6951133	Oops.
6952894	6954935	We started to have mailbag music play in the background there.
6954955	6955456	We don't want that.
6956817	6966803	SSJ100Matt is linking us to a story about an Apple-related incident where Apple apparently banned a game developer because he called the store awful and horrible.
6967664	6974549	The developer's name was Tommy Refens and Apple removed his app Zits and Giggles.
6975249	6978031	Well, for starters, that just needed to be removed, but whatever.
6979653	6987799	Apparently, the creator was at Game Developers Conference, and he said that he absolutely fucking hates the iPhone App Store.
6988400	6995085	He said that the iPhone gaming market is like the Tiger handheld games of the 80s and 90s.
6995505	6999108	You might remember those crappy little LCD games like Mr. Game & Watch-esque stuff.
7000069	7000169	Um...
7000689	7004932	Also, zits and giggles, this was the guy, this was the company, and I think we've talked about him on the store.
7005373	7008916	They would keep raising the price of their game to see who would keep buying it.
7009276	7010817	And they had raised it up to over $400.
7012478	7016742	Apple, of course, didn't tell any reason why they took the game down.
7017282	7018963	So, there you go.
7019003	7021305	But maybe it had to be with the fact that he was acting like a dick.
7022466	7025989	And if you bite the hand that feeds you, they're probably going to cut you off.
7028255	7032696	Uh, Ionotropic asks, Puzzle Quest 2, discuss the puzzle crack.
7033037	7035057	Puzzle Quest 2 is not out yet, is it?
7035397	7036057	It's not out yet.
7036218	7036818	It's coming out.
7037478	7041219	Alan, I know you're a big Puzzle Quest fan, and you like the gyromancers and those types of games.
7041459	7042679	What do you want in a Puzzle Quest 2?
7043280	7044140	Is there anything you're looking for?
7045801	7049104	Um, just have it not be Galactrix, really.
7049444	7050746	It's not Galactrix this time.
7050986	7053208	No, they're going back to the old school puzzle quest.
7053268	7055309	It's more ye olde, uh, bejeweling.
7055530	7055770	Yeah.
7056550	7056911	So there you go.
7056931	7058272	You just want more of the same?
7058352	7059233	No features you can think of?
7059393	7060534	No.
7060554	7063937	Well, they have, like, Peggle Quests or something like that, you know?
7064797	7065478	Peggle Quest?
7065498	7066859	I think DarkSakura would be all over that.
7067920	7069021	Peggle Knights with a K?
7070442	7071063	Peggle Death.
7072003	7072283	All right.
7072943	7074804	And lastly, Actdeft links us to a story.
7074904	7080045	Australia is closer to getting M-rated games, says the tweet that came to us at OLR.
7081065	7084706	Linking us to this story about somebody, I guess, who is stepping down.
7084786	7093508	Michael Atkinson is the South Australian Attorney General, and apparently he's the reason why there is no R18-plus rating for games.
7093908	7095529	He's stepping down, and the thought is...
7096309	7099490	Maybe somebody will get in there that knows what they're talking about with this rating system.
7099970	7105692	So maybe we won't have so many stories about Australia gets such and such banned game or what have you in the future.
7106152	7107172	That would be exciting for them.
7107752	7109293	We'll hope, at least, anyway, for them.
7110593	7112274	All right, let's get back into some news.
7112514	7113694	Loki, what you got for us tonight?
7114344	7119285	Apparently Pikmin 3 is in development and Miyamoto has confirmed that.
7119746	7123427	I believe he confirmed it before though if you ask me, but whatever.
7123647	7133570	Apparently the official Nintendo magazine in the UK was saying that Miyamoto has confirmed that Pikmin 3 development is well underway.
7134490	7141932	Over a year ago it was rumored to be released apparently around this time, but it's not obviously.
7143974	7148359	and no word exactly what they're going to change about it.
7149160	7153404	Apparently, the thought is maybe they're going to announce something at E3.
7156411	7157613	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7174913	7175513	Thanks for watching!
7195200	7198221	Pikmin 3 is probably not going to be any different than Pikmin 2.
7199061	7202563	It'll just be on the Wii, and you'll buy it anyways because you're a sucker.
7202643	7208385	But I don't think this is going to have the same draw as, say, a Mario Galaxy or something like that.
7208845	7218709	And you know, not that this would be a horrible thing, I think it would be a very cheap thing to do, but I could see Nintendo doing another new Super Mario Bros.
7218769	7219909	game this soon.
7220369	7221250	You know what I mean?
7221330	7222070	It's very possible.
7223403	7228046	I went to the chat room and I asked in chat at chat.ornersloungeradio.com I said, chat, help me out.
7228086	7229286	What is the appeal of Pikmin?
7229387	7230867	And Gditz replied, is there any?
7231648	7234630	Actdeft replied, Pikmin is basically an RTS, but cute.
7235870	7237231	So that is apparently what it is.
7237291	7238572	It's an RTS, but cute.
7239933	7240473	So there you go.
7242074	7246436	And Toygak seems to think, if Pikmin 3 does not equal 2, then 3 does not equal 1.
7247517	7249838	Frisbee says, Pikmin was great 9 years ago.
7250238	7251879	LamaJu says, I like Pikmin 1.
7251919	7252920	I thought the game was really fun.
7254028	7256530	I don't know, it's just one of those games I never got around to playing.
7257291	7260815	Togak also chimes in and says, I fucking hate the new play controls.
7261335	7263317	Spike McCrew says, it's got calm music.
7264358	7267541	We need a new Star Fox or a new F-Zero.
7267601	7268322	That's what we need.
7272557	7278560	All right, well, I've got another story for you guys, and it has to do with the first lady, Michelle Obama.
7278620	7282183	Yes, video games and the White House, believe it or not.
7282583	7289847	And apparently it's because the government has kind of, in a way, endorsed Dance Dance Revolution.
7290828	7292249	Okay, let me explain how this works here.
7292650	7299935	Let's Move is a new program, and First Lady Michelle Obama was there for the kickoff, and she actually mentioned the game by name in her speech.
7300336	7304899	She said, and I have to say that many of you have been very creative on this piece already.
7304999	7313045	Folks in West Virginia have taken the lead in bringing DDR, that's Dance Dance Revolution, it's a new video game that gets kids up and moving.
7313346	7314066	Haha, new.
7314086	7315187	That game's been around since, what, 98?
7316468	7345838	many other states use it as well and let me tell you I can attest to Dance Dance Revolution we got it at Camp David and it'll make you sweat and it's addictive in a very good way the president still can't do it so anyhow that's cute I want to point out that Let's Move is not just about DDR though but it's more about getting you know kids and stuff up and moving so it's a good thing they didn't call the program Let Them Move though because that would have been a big groan from the DDR crowd
7347520	7350723	I love the fact though that it's a quote-unquote new video game.
7351864	7353226	Well, technically that's true.
7353546	7356789	They're making new video games in that series all the time.
7357730	7359012	It's just nowhere near new.
7361154	7364618	Alright, DarkSakura's got a story for us and then Listless is coming up.
7366121	7377288	Well, Steam is, of course, removing Assassin's Creed 2 and Silent Hunter 5, but it says it wasn't because of the DRM.
7377908	7383572	They're actually available in places other than Steam.
7384152	7386733	It's just specifically that Steam UK...
7389518	7391281	I wasn't wanting to deal with it.
7391341	7396868	They said that it has to do with local business discussion between Ubisoft and Steam in the UK.
7397548	7399331	But yeah, it's no longer available.
7403188	7406411	Well, I guess they didn't want to try to fix it.
7407331	7414677	Well, you know, I know Steam is denying it, and it's probably accurate because it sounds like this is isolated to overseas.
7414757	7415898	It's not really happening here.
7415918	7416879	This is UK specifically.
7416899	7418060	Yeah.
7418981	7427528	But I still go back to the point I was saying before when I was talking about how Ubisoft's DRM is not just going to get Ubisoft in trouble, that they're going to be calling places like...
7428331	7437195	Target and Walmart where people buy these games saying my game doesn't work and returning it and the retailer is going to get caught in the middle and the minute that starts happening they're going to stop carrying these games.
7437736	7440697	I just think it's ridiculous how people don't think any of this through.
7441437	7441717	Alright.
7443038	7450282	Well folks, it is that time and we haven't done this in a little while on the show but I'm very excited that tonight we are bringing back for 360th episode Listless!
7457591	7461734	Now there's a lot of people in our chat room that are kind of newer to the show and they don't know how this works.
7461774	7463075	So let me explain it for you guys.
7463595	7469279	What we're going to do is we're going to go around the room and we are going to create the definitive list about a certain topic.
7469719	7474603	And tonight's topic is the great idea that Microsoft should steal and make better next.
7475103	7480146	Sometimes our answers are serious, sometimes they're silly, sometimes they're completely nonsensical.
7480546	7484769	But like it or not, it is the list that we have come up with for the question.
7485229	7490753	Now, once all four of us, since we have our special guest Alan tonight, come up with our list, we'll have a list of 12.
7491873	7493054	Then the hard part comes.
7493434	7497517	We will each go around the room and remove one item from the list.
7497697	7501839	Usually it's someone else's item, but you can remove your own, I suppose, if you are feeling cannibalistic like that.
7502440	7504641	That will leave us with a list of eight questions.
7504801	7510304	Then our chat room will vote for their number one and number two favorite in a private message to me.
7510984	7518428	And then your top three answers, based on your votes, will come up with our definitive list.
7519228	7521089	Now keep in mind, you can send us a private message.
7521129	7530154	Now if you have an answer, if you want to help the hosts out, because sometimes we are thinking of topics right in the heat of the moment, Loki,
7531175	7543874	you can yell out your answers in chat right now and they might get included in the host list so again that is the great idea that Microsoft Microsoft Microsoft Microsoft Microsoft
7546078	7548380	I never met a carrot I didn't like, except for this one.
7549120	7552062	The great idea that Microsoft should steal next.
7552823	7554784	Alright, who wants to start us off tonight?
7554964	7557586	Loki, I'll call on you and see if you did your homework.
7557606	7563610	Loki, your number three answer for the great idea, because again, I want to remind you guys where this topic comes from.
7564270	7565211	Project Natal.
7565931	7567432	Stolen motion controller, basically.
7569453	7573796	Xbox Live, kind of taking some things from PC gaming and incorporating into their games.
7575056	7577498	You know, Xbox takes other people's ideas.
7577618	7579399	Not that there's anything wrong with that, because they make them better.
7580019	7581380	They take other people's ideas and make them better.
7581880	7582121	Alright.
7583281	7583822	So here we go.
7584302	7586524	What should they improve next?
7586644	7589187	And I guess it doesn't have to be gaming related, but it helps.
7589267	7593911	Alright, Loki, what is your... Oops, I gotta get my little whiteboard up here to keep track of our answers.
7594292	7598275	Loki, what is your number three answer for the idea that they should steal next?
7598516	7598976	The PSP.
7600217	7604100	The PSP, so making like a handheld system essentially, or just the PSP?
7604840	7605841	No, a handheld system.
7606921	7621791	They shouldn't exactly make it like the PSP, but like, you know, something that's a widescreen, you know, possibly high def, you know, handheld system, plays decent games, maybe ties in with Xbox Live Arcade and, you know, Xbox Live and that kind of stuff.
7622251	7622812	That'd be kind of cool.
7623152	7625413	So Loki is kind of going serious for once.
7625473	7626834	This is a little less scary to me.
7627234	7627995	I won't be like that.
7628575	7629416	All right, fine, fine.
7630037	7632765	DarkSakura, your number three answer.
7632845	7634430	What should Microsoft steal and make better?
7634811	7635513	Pokemans.
7637901	7638781	Pokemon, okay.
7638801	7639641	No, Pokemans.
7640102	7641322	Oh, I have to say Pokemans.
7641342	7642882	That's what it's going to be called, is Pokemans.
7643022	7643862	Okay, Pokemans.
7644162	7650324	Well, I guess that's true, is that they, you know, there was rumors that they had that little monster-making game.
7650344	7652464	I guess that was more LittleBigPlanet, though, than Pokemans.
7652564	7657045	Okay, so Microsoft should make the Pokemon MMO, or the Pokeman MMO.
7657146	7657726	Pokemans.
7657946	7658206	Okay.
7659346	7663087	Alan, your number three answer, what should Microsoft steal and make better?
7663607	7666348	Colonel Sanders secret recipe for chicken.
7668229	7668609	Chicken!
7669950	7671331	Bringing back the chicken reference.
7671871	7676994	So that way I can, like, go into the Avatar store and get my Avatar, you know, a two-piece and a biscuit or whatever.
7681136	7683097	By the way, Alan just made a Drag Race reference.
7683157	7683937	I just want to point out.
7684237	7685178	You didn't know it, but he did.
7689022	7689903	How do you spell Colonel?
7689963	7690985	I can't ever remember.
7691005	7697133	D-O-L-O-N-E-L Very good, Alan.
7697173	7697593	I like that.
7698014	7701498	Alright, the idea that Microsoft should steal and make better.
7701578	7702700	My number three answer.
7703321	7704663	The lesbian tester.
7706158	7706618	DarkSakura.com
7728662	7732743	The George Foreman Full Cow Grilling Machine
7751227	7763874	Yes, the machine that can be only put out, I guess, by Microsoft that would take George Foreman grilling to the next level by fully grilling an entire cow at one time.
7764714	7765114	All right.
7766155	7766655	Fair enough.
7767956	7770017	DarkSakura, your number two answer.
7772518	7776600	An expansion module like the ColecoVision has so you can play other systems games on it.
7778601	7779402	You remember that, don't you?
7781717	7783018	I remember you talking about it.
7783238	7784718	The expansion module number two.
7785138	7786178	Okay, alright.
7788059	7789139	Alan, do you have a number two answer?
7789159	7793140	I want to see something come back like the Dreamcast VMU.
7793921	7795781	A little memory card with the LED thing.
7795961	7799542	So memory cards on the... The visual memory unit.
7799762	7800803	Okay, visual memory cards.
7800903	7801823	Okay, I like that idea.
7801863	7802383	That's a good idea.
7802683	7803823	Any particular reason why that?
7803843	7804504	Chow's on it.
7806524	7807585	It will help with the Pokemans.
7808646	7810107	For the Pokemon game they're going to release.
7810527	7811568	Okay, very good.
7812369	7813330	My number two answer.
7813850	7814611	Let's see, where is my list?
7814971	7817893	My number two answer for the idea that Xbox should steal and make better.
7818594	7823497	A game starring a fat plumber and his brother and a game starring a fruity elf with big ears.
7824378	7824758	DarkSakura.com
7846528	7860618	Pokemans, The Colonel's Recipe, The Hot Lesbian Tester, George Foreman Full Cow Grilling Machine, an expansion module for other system games, visual memory cards, a game starring a fat plumber and his brother, and a game starring a fruity elf with big ears.
7861198	7861499	All right.
7862359	7866040	Now we get down to the number one answers.
7866460	7871242	The number one thing you most want to see the Xbox 360 steal and make better.
7871942	7872282	Loki.
7872702	7878324	Well, if they're going to be guaranteed to make something better, I can't think of a better response than sex.
7878944	7882985	There's not really much better than sex, but...
7885327	7887229	I guess that they're going to find a way to make it better.
7888591	7889412	More power to them.
7890674	7894078	So yes, Microsoft impressed me about making something better than sex.
7894679	7895100	There you go.
7898264	7899025	Make sex better.
7904757	7905537	DarkSakura!
7931872	7933633	Dare I ask for your number one answer.
7933793	7935093	What should they steal and make better?
7936133	7937194	Rainbow farting unicorns.
7937494	7940155	Rainbow farting unicorns.
7940375	7943896	Are you talking about, what is that, robot magic unicorn?
7944216	7945317	Whatever it is.
7945497	7946277	What's the name of the game?
7947057	7949098	Well, my original answer was Propel.
7949618	7951899	Propel, but you want robot unicorn attack.
7952619	7954820	Farty robot unicorns.
7955540	7957601	It's rainbow farting unicorns.
7959099	7959379	Yeah.
7960640	7961441	Rainbow farting.
7961621	7963403	Rainbow farty or farting?
7963683	7964043	Farting.
7964304	7965104	Robot unicorn.
7965124	7966486	That's their special attack is they fart.
7966506	7967406	There you go.
7967907	7968507	All right.
7968587	7970349	To an all erasure soundtrack.
7970970	7972271	To an all erasure soundtrack.
7972291	7972671	You got it.
7972691	7973672	Or Pet Shop Boys works too.
7974032	7974753	DarkSakura?
7975353	7976254	You need to let it go.
7979217	7979978	Okay.
7980378	7985983	Your number one answer, Alan, what is your number one answer for a thing you want Microsoft to steal and make better?
7989514	7990034	He's thinking.
7990194	7990814	I'm blanking.
7991134	7991494	You're blanking?
7991534	7992955	After the sex thing, I just can't.
7993055	7994435	After the sex thing, you just can't?
7994475	7994955	Can I help you?
7995295	7995515	Sure.
7995975	7996555	The Bible.
7997435	7998356	Okay, yeah.
7998896	7999356	Jesus.
7999596	8001716	If they could just do Jesus.
8002396	8003116	Super Jesus.
8006117	8008497	You don't want to do the YouTube you sent me earlier?
8008877	8010518	Alright, fine.
8010658	8013798	Jesus is the idea that they're going to steal and make better.
8013858	8014178	Okay.
8017019	8017379	Oh, Lord.
8018061	8024924	Alright, and my number one answer I don't know, I just kind of decided to go for the obvious Blu-ray!
8027104	8036348	They already did, it was HD DVD But it wasn't really better I mean, and they kind of came out at the same time But now that Blu-ray is out They can take Blu-ray and make it better
8038068	8038509	Alright.
8038709	8039729	Robot Jesus attack?
8039749	8040510	That'd be kinda cool.
8041110	8042350	Here we go!
8042450	8045372	Here's the list as it stands before the elimination.
8045492	8065941	A handheld system, Pokemans, The Colonel's Recipe, The Hot Lesbian Tester, George Foreman's Full Cow Grilling Machine, an expansion module for other system games, visual memory cards, a game starring a fat plumber and his brother, and a game starring a fruity elf with big ears, sex, rainbow farting robot unicorns, Jesus, and Blu-ray.
8066881	8069385	Things that Microsoft is going to steal and make better.
8069926	8073190	Loki, what is not worthy of being on the list?
8073471	8075514	Unfortunately, we've got to narrow this down to eight.
8075594	8076715	It is a tough process.
8077016	8077957	Feelings will be hurt.
8078057	8078898	Hair will be pulled.
8079179	8080340	But it must happen.
8080701	8082644	Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?
8082904	8084885	Blu-ray because it's going to get phased out anyways.
8085145	8085785	You're a bastard.
8086525	8088506	Alright, Blu-rays off the list.
8088906	8092047	DarkSakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?
8092287	8092648	Sex.
8093928	8095549	You eliminated sex?
8095689	8096429	It's overrated.
8096649	8099050	But they're going to make it better.
8099970	8101391	Come on, better sex.
8102231	8104572	Okay, this is kind of...
8106363	8109327	DarkSakura has eliminated sex from the list.
8109347	8111089	Rob knows why I don't want it on the list.
8111109	8113391	No, I understand, but it's just funny.
8113431	8114773	Our chat room is going to yell and scream.
8114793	8115634	There's going to be hair pulling.
8115694	8116535	It's boring.
8118097	8118818	It is boring.
8118858	8119879	But they're going to make it better.
8121459	8123680	It'll launch and then all of a sudden, Red Rings.
8124520	8125280	Oh no.
8126120	8126880	That's true.
8126920	8128661	But it won't matter for the guys involved.
8128801	8129781	They never have a problem.
8129861	8131342	I don't want Red Rings on my balls.
8131522	8131822	Alright.
8133862	8136023	It'll be over before the women enjoy it.
8136203	8136563	Alright.
8138063	8140824	Alan, which of these is not worthy?
8141164	8143104	Oh, DarkSakura's getting booed by chat.
8143445	8145045	Go in there and regulate, DarkSakura.
8145165	8145445	Alright.
8150095	8152096	Alan, which of these is not worthy of the list?
8152236	8153496	The hot lesbian tester.
8153956	8155597	Oh, you bastard!
8156137	8156617	Why?
8157217	8158458	Do you not love lesbians?
8158878	8160118	Oh wait, I'm asking the wrong person.
8161979	8164059	Why are you taking the hot lesbian tester off the list?
8164680	8165060	I don't know.
8166360	8167340	Just because it's my answer, huh?
8167360	8167981	Yeah, yeah.
8168001	8168301	Dick.
8168801	8169101	Alright.
8172882	8176364	You're going to wish that the 360 had the sex support pretty soon.
8176765	8177085	All right.
8178986	8181187	The item I'm going to eliminate from the list.
8181668	8189152	I am taking off the George Foreman full cow grilling machine because that joke is so 2007.
8189212	8191474	It's the PS3 that looks like one.
8192154	8193475	I don't want them to copy that.
8193935	8195056	That's the PS3 things.
8195116	8196117	Let Sony have something.
8196869	8198470	Alright, so that's why I've eliminated her from the list.
8198811	8200232	So, here we go.
8200252	8201332	Slim can only do Veal.
8201973	8204595	These are the eight that you can vote for tonight.
8205275	8219787	A handheld system, Pokemans, The Colonel's Recipe, an expansion module for other system games, visual memory cards, a game starring a fat plumber and his brother, and a game starring a fruity elf with big ears, rainbow farting robot unicorns, and...
8220507	8220947	Jesus.
8221648	8224249	Which of these should they steal and make better?
8224809	8230712	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your two votes.
8231653	8235935	And if you want the blur beta code, I have two to give away tonight.
8236295	8241877	Send in your votes and a message that says, I want the Blur Beta code or something along those lines.
8242257	8247099	If you don't want the Blur Beta code, don't send me that message, but you can still send me your votes.
8247699	8253862	So you send me an additional message that says, I want the Blur Beta code.
8253902	8258863	If you don't know how to send a private message, I will recap that process for you in chat real soon.
8259484	8262565	For now, back to the show while those votes come in.
8264526	8266506	Some folks in chat said we made the list boring.
8266546	8268427	We took off every single interesting answer.
8268467	8270708	We took off the lesbians, the sex, the meat.
8271509	8272849	Everything was gone.
8273590	8275751	By the way, the beta code is only on the 360.
8276691	8277431	You must have a 360.
8278132	8280753	Please do not ask for the code if you yourself are not going to use it.
8280833	8284394	If you sell that shit on eBay, I will find you and I will end your life.
8285015	8285315	Alright.
8286836	8287376	Moving on.
8288769	8289449	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8314605	8316327	Warriors and Archers Xbox 360, PS3, Games for Windows
8335635	8340319	Was this like the top secret game that Bethesda is supposedly working on that everybody thought was the Blizzard MMO?
8340899	8343741	I don't know, but it looks like it's just like a hack and slash game.
8343761	8344362	Looks cool though.
8344562	8345262	It looks really neat.
8347384	8350987	But, I mean, I don't know if this is the top secret game they're working on.
8351007	8353609	And this is Bethesda, not Blizzard.
8357519	8358501	I meant to say Bethesda.
8358521	8359041	I say Blizzard.
8359262	8363508	Sorry, I'm getting distracted with tallying the votes for listless right now.
8364430	8368976	Let me get to this next story real quick about layoffs at IGN.
8369056	8370439	Unfortunately, layoffs have...
8372131	8396143	hit IGN and um yep too bad so sad sorry to hear it uh but unfortunately a lot of folks uh got laid off over at IGN and um I don't know I guess that'll be less podcast all departments all right times are tough I'm sorry times are tough and it's not funny when people lose their jobs but um you know it's tough out there it's hard out there for a pimp what can I say
8399242	8403668	If they really love games, there'll be people doing it for free, just like many other people do.
8404509	8405190	So, we'll see.
8405491	8406592	No one in particular, Rob, right?
8406812	8407533	No, no one in particular.
8407654	8409236	Alright, let's get to the mailbag.
8409376	8410597	Every week you guys send us emails.
8410658	8413682	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and we read some here on air.
8415831	8420135	DarkSakura is going to open up the mailbag, rip it right open, and pull out some of her favorite emails.
8420796	8421977	I'm reading them for you right now.
8422097	8428462	I would be happy to, but my window that had all the emails on it actually just completely vanished, so I have to reopen them.
8428482	8429343	Can you reopen it real quick?
8430004	8432606	Okay, because I've got to tally the cage match votes here.
8433087	8434608	Yeah, sorry, listless votes.
8435929	8436870	I'm pulling it back up.
8437030	8437751	Okay.
8438071	8439072	Keep your pants on.
8439112	8439733	I don't want dead air.
8440433	8442135	Loki, what are you watching over there?
8442195	8442575	Here we go.
8442695	8443756	I've got the first one.
8443816	8451903	I'm watching a violent video of someone making levels in WarioWare DIY, like blowing someone in half.
8452183	8452864	Here's another one.
8452924	8455226	They're shooting them.
8456607	8457568	Shooting with rainbow farts?
8457828	8458489	Sniper rifle.
8459542	8460423	This is from Cheeseburger.
8460763	8461023	Yay.
8461483	8462123	Hey, OLR.
8462204	8465665	As you may or may not know, I've been saving up for gaming PC for a year now.
8466546	8470168	I finally got the money just this morning and I spent $1,300 at Newegg.
8470548	8473670	This PC will be good enough to run almost any game on near highest settings.
8473730	8475631	The only games I have right now are World of Warcraft.
8476371	8476612	Addict!
8477452	8478213	and Command & Conquer 3.
8478553	8481936	In a few hours, I'm hoping to win an eBay auction of Crysis.
8482177	8485820	My question is, do you have any recommendations for games I should get?
8486221	8489344	When the game was released, it was no matter, just that they are good games.
8489504	8490245	I suggest Loom.
8495069	8496050	And Star Trek Online.
8497031	8499754	I don't know, some of the Borderlands is pretty cool if you don't have that.
8501452	8503314	He also sends a follow-up to the email.
8503974	8508277	Forgot to mention in my last email, yesterday my friend had a 16th birthday party at John's Incredible Pizza.
8508858	8509858	I know, what a place for that.
8509898	8512820	And I was wondering, why have you given it the title John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza?
8512840	8516163	Wait, wait, we have somebody here local that's been to John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza?
8516183	8517364	Because those are only in NorCal.
8518104	8520945	As far as I know, unless they really grew fast.
8521245	8523105	Well, did you eat the pizza when you were there?
8523165	8524006	It's kind of shitty.
8524746	8528807	And it's been sitting out for a long time, and little kids put their hands all over it and all that stuff.
8529327	8530447	No, the place is okay.
8530627	8534969	I mean, actually, I gotta say, it was really cool, because one of the workers there once, like, recognized us.
8535049	8538390	I don't know how, but they did, and I thought that was really awesome.
8538550	8539270	And Dan was there, too.
8539450	8539910	Exactly.
8540050	8541931	So, you know, no.
8541971	8542531	They're fine.
8542671	8546252	I have nothing against John's Incredible Pizza, but it's a fun... The place was pretty fun.
8546272	8547212	The pizza was pretty suck.
8547412	8548053	Alright, there you go.
8548853	8549113	Alright.
8550995	8560661	From Robert M. From my last email a month or two ago, I tried to be clever and use a reference to the spam filters used on your forum discussion on the show, so my email was most likely lost to the spam filters.
8561162	8561762	Sorry about that.
8562342	8568006	My question now is, how long are the animations for the summons for Final Fantasy XIII, and can they be skipped?
8568607	8574711	My brother, back in the day, generally enjoyed Final Fantasy VII, but was turned off by the summons taking about, what, 10 to 15 seconds every time?
8575311	8580273	which can actually add up to get repetitive over the course of your typical 40 hour JRPG lifespan.
8581134	8581394	Rob?
8583455	8585016	Sorry, I'm focusing on tallying votes.
8585036	8585716	What was the question?
8587337	8589338	How long are the summon scenes?
8589558	8591499	We have a shit ton of votes tonight.
8591719	8593379	How long are the summon scenes?
8593439	8594060	Not very long.
8595280	8596821	No, I don't think you can, but they're not very long.
8596901	8597501	No, you can skip them.
8600638	8601838	I wish you could skip Knights of the Round.
8602259	8608081	Seriously, when I would do Knights of the Round on Quadra Magic and then Mimic, I had time to go make a sandwich.
8609301	8610041	Fix myself a drink.
8611002	8611382	Come back.
8611402	8617984	I love how that when Square heard all of the complaints about Knights of the Round for 7 and they're like, how can we get around this for 8?
8618704	8619965	They're like, oh, I know.
8620125	8624386	Let's make it so we have to watch the summon and tap Square for the boost.
8624586	8625106	Do you remember that?
8625146	8626187	That was their answer to that?
8626327	8627787	To make you watch it with the power up?
8628047	8628248	Yeah.
8628268	8628688	That was funny.
8631849	8635871	Next up... And that's all part of the reason why I hated 8, just so you know.
8636812	8639933	This person didn't sign it, so I'm just going to say person who didn't sign their email.
8641554	8646517	Have been wondering, have been enjoying the... Or maybe I'll just use the first part of their email, Sepwin, I guess.
8647317	8648578	Have been enjoying the show for a while.
8648758	8650659	One comment about Microsoft's Project Natal.
8651359	8654361	You mentioned one thing they showed were racing games.
8654381	8659664	As someone who's gotten heavy into sim racing games, I think that wouldn't work well even for arcade racers.
8660624	8663305	The main reason is there would be no rumble or forced feedback to the player.
8663805	8669566	For any racing game that isn't meant to be a total arcade experience, a wheel with feedback, preferably forced feedback, is critical.
8670266	8673947	I would argue even burnout games need some sort of tactile response to the player.
8674047	8674507	Best wishes.
8675367	8676167	I agree, actually.
8676627	8677747	That's what I kind of like.
8678108	8682688	Like, what was it that Rush had really crazy feedback?
8683709	8687309	And it actually made it really fun to play, I thought.
8687469	8690170	You know, added a much bigger level into the control.
8693553	8694553	Anyway, last email.
8696774	8698155	Subject, Rogue Kitty.
8698675	8698935	Okay.
8700436	8701917	I'll be where President Cat has gone.
8701957	8704238	Rogue Kitty shall forever be known as Dictator Cat.
8704318	8705818	Mwahaha Snow Villagers.
8706639	8706879	Okay.
8710700	8711121	I guess.
8711541	8712341	It came with a picture.
8715322	8717223	Oh.
8718584	8721125	War on string may be unwinnable, says General Cat.
8723098	8723599	That's funny.
8726162	8727043	I'm going to save the picture.
8727123	8728285	I'll upload it somewhere.
8729426	8730988	Perhaps our photo thing.
8731890	8732530	Perhaps.
8735074	8735955	Anyway, that's the last of it.
8738158	8741120	I'm not done telling votes yet, but we have some more news to get to, right?
8741340	8742601	Or no, we got the FUs of the week.
8742861	8743522	Some angst.
8744082	8748726	Every week we like to take a little bit of our time out and get some angst out and some anger.
8749266	8752628	And hopefully there's enough of it tonight to get me through the rest of the cage match votes.
8753209	8754149	I keep saying cage match.
8754249	8754930	Listless votes.
8755290	8757512	Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week, boys and girls.
8773992	8776933	Um, FU to my digestion.
8777633	8778593	Really, that's it.
8781194	8781514	Loki.
8783895	8790516	Um, I'm gonna have to say FU to, um, I don't really know.
8790736	8791397	I don't have anything.
8791637	8793237	I guess the lawn being too long.
8793757	8794197	I don't know.
8797398	8798679	Uh, Alan, do you have an FU this week?
8799199	8799759	FUs to unemployment.
8799779	8800179	Unemployment.
8802540	8806441	My FU goes to all the boxes on my kitchen table.
8807781	8808701	That's my FU of the week.
8809882	8810282	All right.
8810942	8813442	Usually I would be doing the listless results right now, but I'm not ready.
8813502	8815843	We had so many tonight that I'm not ready.
8815923	8818603	This is where I had it in our list, but I'll have to jump in later.
8818663	8820744	So, Loki, would you do another story for us, please?
8821124	8826365	By the way, we will be opening the Skype line in just a little bit, but we have an interview with our friend Aaron in just a moment.
8826805	8828105	So stay tuned.
8828405	8837007	Yes, apparently Bungie has re-registered or registered new trademarks for Marathon and Bungie Aerospace.
8837627	8845509	Well, Marathon, of course, is their first FPS that they released way back in the day, so perhaps a new game in that series.
8846289	8851290	Bungie Aerospace, not exactly sure what the hell that's about, but...
8853080	8853621	Bungie Aerospace
8869292	8874514	Is this some type of further Halo thing, or does this give us some type of idea what they're actually going to be doing after Halo?
8875395	8875775	Not really.
8877456	8878696	Other than it being a trademark.
8878716	8881978	I mean, obviously, I would imagine Marathon's going to be coming at some point.
8882878	8887040	Didn't they release Marathon on Xbox Live Arcade, and I don't remember it being very good.
8887060	8889181	I don't remember Marathon.
8889241	8889921	No, they did.
8890001	8890502	They did.
8890582	8892743	Yeah, it was... Well, you know, it was an old game.
8893203	8893563	Whatever.
8895604	8895744	Hmm.
8900559	8901961	Would you mind doing the next story too?
8901981	8903782	Because I am still trying to tally votes.
8903822	8905704	That's how many people we had voting tonight.
8906324	8908787	Throw in a beta code and that's what we got.
8909327	8909647	Okay.
8910608	8913751	Apparently the Commodore 64 is making a return.
8914371	8914672	Yes.
8915192	8920657	A brand new, I guess, keyboard.
8922699	8925221	It looks like it's all inclusive in this keyboard.
8925241	8926162	Yeah.
8928263	8932665	based on, they're saying, the Cybernet ZPC GX31.
8934386	8939928	And it's kind of cool looking, a little futuristic thing.
8939968	8943990	It's got a... I think a lot of those pictures... I'm finally done, sorry.
8944230	8946191	I think a lot of those pictures were prototypes.
8946251	8951053	Like, they're not the actual thing, especially like that one where you see the old-ass system running Windows 95.
8951113	8951553	Oh, yeah.
8952033	8953774	Windows XP is, yeah.
8953994	8954194	Yeah.
8954554	8980227	obviously a little bit silly but dude I'm all about the Commodore 64 making a comeback because there was some that was like again I'm hoping it's not something that I view in a greater light because it was when I was young but there were just some awesome programs on the 64 and I love the fact here's the number one reason the 64 was awesome you could hook it up to your TV that's why that's why I won the computer wars I'm telling you at least back in the 80s the personal computer wars before the IBM's so that's kind of neat all right
8981621	8982382	I'm finally ready.
8982502	8986365	By the way, if they released a new Commodore 64, what do you think they should put on it?
8987826	8988226	I don't know.
8988707	8989087	Peggle?
8990168	8990528	Peggle.
8990888	8992830	A bunch of music-making software would be good.
8993170	8993831	Mario Paint?
8993871	8994131	Yeah.
8995152	8996052	Let me put it this way, though.
8996072	9002697	The Commodore 64 would probably have more applications than an Apple PC or an Apple computer.
9002918	9004179	Hopefully it would be backwards compatible.
9004999	9009022	So let's get to the listless results tonight.
9009042	9010764	We're going to do the listless results.
9011240	9011801	Play the music!
9030259	9030920	for third place.
9031240	9034002	A tie for the number three thing you most want to see Microsoft improve on.
9034042	9034803	By the way, this is it.
9035063	9036064	There is no arguing.
9036284	9037966	This is a very scientific process.
9038506	9040468	Microsoft, if you're listening, here it is.
9041088	9044331	Number three, the masses want Pokemans.
9044891	9047013	They want you to take the Pokemans and make them better.
9048154	9054419	And tied with that, you might have to fry those Pokemans in the Colonel's Secret Recipe because you've got to make that better too.
9054500	9058123	The Colonel's Recipe and Pokemans tying for third place tonight.
9059568	9065110	Second place tonight, Visual Memory Cards is what they want you to steal and make better.
9065311	9066251	VMUs.
9066651	9068212	You need to take those and make them better.
9069312	9077576	And lastly, the number one thing that Microsoft needs to steal and make better, the PSP, a handheld system.
9077616	9078116	That's right.
9078636	9083238	Microsoft, we want a handheld system as voted by our chatters.
9083298	9083639	That's it.
9083699	9084199	No arguing.
9084539	9084899	We're done.
9085239	9086400	Windows Mobile, not going to cut it.
9087581	9089663	You need to steal the PSP and make it better.
9090524	9092226	There are two parts to this tonight.
9092667	9099695	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 people want the beta, oh no, 11 people want the beta code.
9101317	9104781	Alan, pick a number between 1 and 11 if you wouldn't mind.
9105458	9106439	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9124974	9132059	8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
9128276	9132059	Amaze Satsuma wins a Blur Beta Code.
9132099	9133900	So congratulations to you guys.
9134500	9137002	Sorry to everyone else, but there it is.
9137102	9141985	So Llama Juice and Amaze Satsuma win Beta Codes just for voting and participating in the show tonight.
9142325	9148609	You can too, Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right at AllGamesRadio, AllGames.com.
9149509	9160889	Alright, we're going to get to the Skype line in a minute, although I was hoping to speak to Aaron, but I closed the number with his phone number.
9166746	9172649	When I was tallying all the votes, I closed the window with his number, so now I'm waiting for it.
9173209	9174510	So there it is.
9174690	9176151	Also, I need to send those codes.
9176331	9177492	So I'm going to send those codes.
9177912	9182494	Loki, do you have any quick last-minute stories to work in here while I wait to hopefully hear from Aaron?
9183074	9186955	Alan Wake, several download content episodes are due out this year.
9187696	9192037	Second season possibly available depending on the audience.
9192057	9197699	I don't know if they buy it or not or how well the first season does.
9198539	9199119	That's kind of neat.
9199219	9201480	Kind of reminds me of what they're doing with Heavy Rain.
9201500	9203921	They're going to be releasing some download content seasons for that.
9204421	9210503	And of course the game is set to hit shelves on May 18th on the Xbox 360.
9213522	9217383	Let's see here.
9218683	9226024	I don't know what they're doing with this, but their casting apparently has been released for the Kane and Lynch film.
9226764	9230065	And Kane, pretty cool.
9230085	9233245	They're going to have Bruce Willis to play Kane.
9233986	9241947	Lynch, however, is being played by Jamie Foxx, who I might add looks absolutely nothing like the character of Lynch.
9244992	9245713	He's a good actor, though.
9245793	9254863	And if you think about it, not to be all racist or anything, but a black man playing a character named Lynch is a little weird, if you ask me.
9255824	9256224	Wow.
9256725	9257185	Wow.
9257666	9259328	I have no response for that at all.
9260129	9261310	I'm just saying, okay?
9261490	9263753	But seriously, though, Jamie Foxx, great actor.
9264233	9266154	But he looks nothing like the character.
9266654	9269235	Billy Bob Thornton looks more like the character, I think.
9269396	9270736	Of course, he's a horrible actor.
9271437	9273097	Well, at least now he's a horrible actor.
9273157	9278480	Well, I think, you know, with makeup and so forth, they'll give him the mullet and the glasses and everything he needs.
9278500	9280881	But he's gonna look weird in the mullet and glasses.
9280941	9284863	I mean, he's... It's a different race.
9284983	9288825	It's like as bad as the whole Chung-Li thing in the last Street Fighter movie.
9289813	9315162	Not Asian, doesn't look anything like Chung Li Oh, and can't act By the way, BondsS006 in chat says I am black myself and I say no And to what Loki said, yes, yes, yes Same thing ran through my head, WTF So maybe Loki is not as insensitive as we all think Every time I see the Prince of Persia trailer With Jake Gyllenhaal in the movie theater Every time I see that trailer, I just want to scream out He's white!
9315722	9319143	Like to the theater Just, yeah You should
9320768	9326510	I have to add, this is completely off topic here, but they finally released the riff tracks for the new Twilight movie.
9327090	9328771	I am very excited to watch that.
9329711	9333712	Not that I'm excited to watch the Twilight movies, but the riff tracks were fucking hilarious.
9334152	9335493	And we watched it with The Happening.
9335913	9339314	Oh my god, completely different movie watching that.
9339434	9342175	It was just ridiculously funny.
9346460	9347400	No phone number yet.
9347460	9348020	No, I got it.
9348040	9348380	I got it.
9348420	9348740	I'm sorry.
9348780	9351441	I was just waiting for the conversation to finish because good times.
9351481	9353161	I like it when you say things that will get you in trouble.
9353621	9353901	All right.
9353961	9362443	So we're going to give our good buddy Aaron, also known as YYR, a call because he has a brand new game on the Xbox Live Marketplace in the indie game section.
9362743	9363923	And we want to talk to him about it.
9363963	9365383	So let's get him on the line.
9367104	9369004	We're going to call him on our Skype line right now.
9369024	9371724	And then we'll open up the Skype line for anybody to call in at 1-877-GAME.
9372905	9374105	Hey, Aaron, how you doing?
9375143	9375924	I figured it was you.
9376044	9376924	Hey, how'd you know?
9377025	9381208	It wasn't just the whole back and forth about he ran off to get a drink at just the wrong moment.
9381748	9382589	How you doing, Aaron?
9382629	9384470	Congratulations, you released a game tonight.
9385531	9392217	I'm doing okay, which is pretty cool considering this has been a bumpy ride.
9392377	9401404	Losing power from last Saturday night through this Thursday evening and basically shacking up with my parents and doing all that I could from there.
9402483	9409265	Working on convention crap for most of the weekend And now I think I'm coming down with a cold Oh goody, now that's right, you're going to be at PAX East, right?
9410725	9414607	Now you're showing off Snake 360 in your latest game at a booth there?
9415627	9430451	I'm going to have all four of my games Three of them will have been released up to that point And the fourth I thought would probably have been released But it's failed review on a technicality Uh oh
9431354	9434317	It's coming soon, and you get to play it first.
9434337	9434838	How cool is that?
9446351	9446871	Hey, there you go.
9446911	9450214	Hey, that's some reason why people want to go to PAX is to play the games first.
9450554	9453436	And by the way, Ziba in our chat room is suggesting take some Airborne.
9453596	9455117	But SH100Matt says it doesn't work.
9455297	9456038	So, vitamins.
9456158	9458940	All right, well, let's talk about your latest game.
9458960	9462202	So tonight on Xbox Live Marketplace, you released a game called Falling.
9462543	9464404	We have a little clip so you can hear some of the music.
9466966	9467806	Yeah, that sounds familiar.
9467826	9471388	Well, basically what it kind of is, is it's a puzzle-type game at its core.
9492509	9493350	Damn that walrus!
9509461	9516984	So what you need to do is clean up the mess and then crush Wally before he causes trouble, which of course is touching you, you die.
9517644	9520685	But, you know, at first also Wally starts off stupid.
9520705	9525206	He just kind of walks back and forth and waits for you to crush him, either by pushing a block on him or...
9525666	9537912	You know, dropping it on his head or whatever, but then later on he can push blocks around, he can jump over things, he can kick blocks at your face, you know, just generally make life miserable for you.
9538593	9544456	So, you know, you gotta get rid of him and you also have to clear the blocks by throwing or kicking the same colored blocks into each other.
9545176	9554621	So, you know, you're matching colors, you're avoiding walking walruses and, you know, just generally things get pretty chaotic later in the game and
9555177	9562142	It's fun, it's got the retro vibe, and it plays a lot like a frenetic arcade experience.
9562803	9570868	I like to compare it to something like Bubble Bobble, where it starts off simple and then it gets very complex and very action-packed.
9572189	9578614	I feel it does have the kind of lasting enjoyment that a game like that used to have.
9579474	9581476	I think I pretty much captured that spirit.
9581846	9585188	It definitely looks like something that could be from Game Room.
9585288	9588370	It's kind of that old, kind of retro look to it.
9588430	9591712	It seems like this game is coming out just in time, honestly, for everything.
9592433	9595795	Yeah, well, I mean, I hope people download it and they...
9596360	9600922	You know, they get the same kind of feelings that they get when they play one of their favorite old games.
9601582	9603123	And then I hope they buy it.
9604584	9606264	So you can't get the trial in the marketplace right now.
9606284	9610226	I'm going to go ahead and let the... Oh, you have several videos up here on YouTube, don't you?
9610266	9612227	You have, like, an attract mode, some other gameplay clips.
9612747	9615349	Let's try one of these other clips here on the YouTube.
9615709	9617109	Now, you posted some clips of the game.
9617149	9619490	This is round 10 we're going to look at now.
9619530	9621792	So I'm imagining things get a little more intense in this level.
9621812	9622632	The bricks fall faster.
9622652	9622732	Yeah.
9623012	9627455	Actually, I was playing on hard difficulty when I made that video, so it's kind of nuts.
9628036	9630938	I don't think, I think that video ends with my death, actually.
9631678	9633659	Now, there's multiple, there's wal-rye.
9634060	9635281	There's multiple walrus.
9635881	9636641	Walruses.
9636662	9638062	Oh, yeah, they come in packs.
9638423	9639023	Oh, my gosh.
9639043	9640064	They're like real walruses.
9640284	9642946	Actually, I'm not basing that statement on any fact whatsoever.
9643436	9644416	Okay, I've got to ask you.
9644456	9645996	This seems like the most obvious question.
9646577	9649437	Where did the inspiration for a game like this come from?
9649917	9652038	Did this come to you in a dream or something?
9652098	9656138	Little Penguin's going to get his home invaded by walruses.
9656678	9658159	Where the hell did you come up with this?
9659499	9670781	Well, to be completely honest, the entire concept for the game started with my, I guess now, ex-fiance's obsession with Piplup.
9672285	9673905	That is completely true.
9674666	9677106	And I wanted to make a game with a penguin in it.
9677966	9680287	And I thought, okay, blocks are falling from the ceiling.
9680807	9683748	And then I thought, okay, something has to come and be an antagonist.
9684208	9690089	And then, you know, I figured, well, you know, I think I heard somewhere that walruses in real life don't like penguins.
9690609	9691910	So I started going with that.
9692270	9696451	And then when I had already drawn all the sprites, I decided to actually look this up.
9696991	9701672	And according to stuff I found on Wikipedia, the simple fact of the matter is
9702395	9709200	So you found out that walruses and penguins were like mortal enemies and you're like, there's a game there.
9715958	9717699	That's exactly what I was going for.
9740485	9752536	I totally just basically wanted to make it feel like an old arcade game.
9752876	9766107	From the moment you power up the machine and you see the ROM test and it puts the option settings on the screen for a fraction of a second to going into the options and being able to adjust how many coins the game costs.
9766227	9766908	It's all in there.
9767239	9767479	Nice.
9767899	9769379	But no real coins.
9769900	9774201	It's much different than Game Room, where Game Room charges you 50 cents a play, but that won't happen here, right?
9775161	9775741	No, no.
9775801	9778161	You can try it for free, just like all indie games.
9778742	9785823	And if you spend 80 space bucks, just 80 space bucks, you can play it as much as you want for as long as you want.
9787624	9789344	I think I caught, how many space bucks was that?
9790530	9793051	80.
9791770	9793051	$1.
9792311	9793051	$1?
9792531	9793051	That's a steal.
9793091	9793471	That's great.
9793871	9794391	Now, what is this?
9794491	9805034	I noticed, I just caught this briefly at the end of the attract screen here, that when it's showing the high score table, it looks like the default scores say, import Futari now?
9805094	9805634	What is that?
9806955	9807755	Oh, nothing.
9808675	9814777	No, that's a direct reference to Mushihime Sama Futari, the cave shooting game released last year.
9816020	9823024	Actually, there's another game that I'm releasing soon called Sharpshooter, and I make a reference to DJ Max Technica and its high score tables.
9823804	9827747	I'm all about referencing other games, other stuff.
9828787	9840333	In fact, before we end this conversation, I would like to actually directly reference one of the in-game references that I have actually in all my games, and I'm turning that into a giveaway for three of our chat roomers.
9842495	9848817	Okay, so what, the chatters have to know what it is that all your games have in common, or what's the deal?
9850178	9851258	Well, do you want to do it now?
9851578	9852539	Sure, why not?
9853839	9868885	Okay, well, in every game that I've released so far, Snake360, Card Arcade, Falling, and also in the game that I'm releasing next month, Sharpshooter, and by the way, all those games will be on display at PAX East, and I hope that
9869392	9873735	Everyone who comes to PAX East will come to our booth and have a really great time.
9874095	9881020	I'm going to be next to Mommy's Best Games, and they're going to have a bunch of great stuff too, including an unreleased game called Grapple Buggy.
9881760	9884782	So, you know, come, play the games.
9885062	9888545	I'm going to be running Snake360 tournaments all weekend long.
9888905	9892327	You can compete for prizes, t-shirts, soundtrack CDs.
9892407	9894428	Like, I decided to go all out with this.
9895089	9895249	So...
9896138	9911729	But at any rate, no, it's not OL or G related Thank you, chat But I will absolutely stop by the booth Absolutely, I'll be stopping by to say hello I am looking forward to meeting you Absolutely, I'll be by I don't know what I'm wearing yet Everybody's asking me, what are you wearing?
9911769	9920435	So I can spot you and see you I don't know I was hoping to have my frilly orange scarf But it looks like I'll have to save that for PAX Prime
9920655	9922656	Hi, I have this thing called homework.
9922696	9923176	I know.
9923256	9924297	Bakers can't be choosers.
9924657	9926378	But I'll find something creative.
9926398	9929639	Well, I know my friend Amanda plans to wear a corset one day.
9929679	9931080	So I was thinking, well, I could wear a corset.
9931500	9932720	But I don't know how well that would go over.
9932820	9934361	So we'll have to see.
9935261	9936522	Stay tuned to the Twitter, folks.
9936562	9937022	I'll let you know.
9938183	9938503	All right.
9938523	9940144	But anyway, back to the giveaway.
9940184	9940384	Yes.
9942463	9948890	So, in all of the games that I have released or am releasing, I have a number in there.
9949111	9955438	It's usually in the form of one of the high score numbers, and it's a direct reference to a video game company.
9956339	9961466	The first three people to type it into chat get a code to download following for free.
9962028	9962688	Woohoo!
9963168	9964149	Free falling.
9964249	9968611	Save that dollar by typing that number into chat right now.
9968791	9969871	Not the number.
9970071	9971352	I don't need the number.
9971392	9973353	I need the video game company that I referenced.
9973393	9974073	Oops, my bad.
9974093	9974733	It's not Konami.
9975134	9975554	My bad.
9975594	9980076	The video game company he references and he flat out has told you it is not Konami.
9980736	9982156	So go ahead and guess.
9982236	9982717	There it is.
9982737	9983317	And you know what?
9983997	9984577	And you know what?
9985638	9988739	Yeah, I'm not seeing it yet, so I'm just going to say what the number is.
9989059	9989319	Okay.
9989399	9989560	It's 765-
9992475	10002201	765 It's not Konami, it's not Bungie I see it, I'm waiting for two other people to say it before I confirm it What's the list of what it's not?
10002381	10006344	It's not Konami, and the number is 765
10017392	10035295	Okay, three people wrote Namco, we're done Oh, Namco, tell us a little more about the reference to Namco Yes, I'm basically a Namco fangirl So many of Namco's games are on my all-time list of favorites that I couldn't possibly not be a Namco fangirl
10036253	10039075	I'm basically referencing them in, well, everything.
10052661	10057367	I apologize for the listeners that have heard this story 5,000 times, but you know I love this story.
10057968	10065737	In the Namco PS3 game, the Namco Treasures Volume 1, there is a direct OLR reference in your face.
10065757	10066037	Really?
10066077	10066738	Yes, when
10067619	10068100	Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki
10087800	10114903	Oh wow, I gotta go run and check that right now No kidding, it's on the PS3 and it's the Namco Treasures Volume 1 It's the one that has like Pac-Man and all that stuff I think I actually downloaded that I don't know if I still have it on the hard drive But if not, I'm getting it again But it's not in the demo, I just want to make that clear You will not see it in the demo, that splash screen is only in the full version Because the way the PS3 works is funky Your demo is like completely separate from your regular game It's not like the 360 where you upgrade I'm not happy about it either
10115638	10130786	yeah so again if you hadn't heard that story before I love that story so much I totally support that yeah it's that's when you know you made it we've been doing this show for eight years to get our name in a video game was amazing so we were very happy about that
10131305	10133367	I started falling, I'd say probably around September or October of last year
10154228	10180048	and now granted I was working on Sharpshooter which is my release for next month at the same time and by the way if you're developing a game I would very very strongly recommend that you never ever try to work on two at the same time because as with most things it'll probably wind up taking you longer you know to finish both than if you just did one and then the other but yeah it does take a while because you know it's
10180433	10181234	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10202905	10207051	One thing I say to people, people really just don't realize how much time goes into a game.
10207072	10217988	The next time you're walking through a 3D environment in a first-person shooter, don't just run past that intricately designed building and never look at it again.
10219106	10227930	Actually take the time to look at it and admire what a bunch of designers worked on because they spent hours on that and we run past it in five seconds.
10228870	10232012	It's amazing all the detail that goes into that type of work.
10232052	10232852	It's kind of like a movie.
10232932	10237334	The list of credits at the end of the movie, it really does take that many people to make a movie.
10237594	10239975	But this game, Falling, was made by one guy.
10241280	10242080	Yeah, that's me.
10242100	10242360	I hope so too.
10242380	10244041	Remember the three lucky winners.
10244061	10244401	Watch your PMs.
10267713	10272358	I'm just looking to get my name out there and maybe make enough to someday do this for a living.
10272378	10273219	That's all.
10273620	10275502	I'm not looking to make a fortune or anything.
10276503	10277925	That sounds like a fair compromise.
10277985	10279266	We'll see you at PAX East, Aaron.
10280447	10281348	Alrighty, see you there.
10281448	10284312	Alright, I'll probably be assaulting you with a microphone there too, just so you know.
10284652	10285733	That's just fine.
10285793	10286474	Alright, good luck.
10286514	10286995	See you at the show.
10288123	10288583	See you later
10317635	10341760	Which I think is kind of interesting So yeah, that's very cool So congratulations to Derek on that accomplishment Who knows, maybe Falling being a retro game could be next Who knows, we'll see I don't know if that'll open the floodgates But congrats to all of our friends that are indie developers Man, it takes a lot of work I wish I had that kind of talent I would make an OLR game, I think that would be fun But we'll see Alright, are we ready to go to the phones and take some calls tonight?
10342952	10344134	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

10402972	10403794	Yes, I did.
10403914	10404735	Have fun with that.
10404916	10405597	Good luck with that.
10405657	10405897	All right.
10405937	10410766	Hopefully your video doesn't screw up our bandwidth, but we'll see what happens.
10410966	10411166	Oh, no.
10411186	10411667	He shut it off.
10411687	10411888	All right.
10411908	10412208	That's right.
10412549	10412869	What's up?
10413130	10413651	What's up, Lama Juice?
10413671	10414132	Sorry about that.
10414152	10414713	No, that's okay.
10414833	10415173	It's cool.
10415474	10415895	What's on your mind?
10417376	10422298	I went down to GDC in San Francisco last week-ish.
10422698	10422918	Yeah.
10423778	10431421	And I don't know if you guys – I got to the show late last week, so I didn't get to hear about anything you guys were talking about.
10431721	10438223	No, we didn't go to the show, which is funny because we're not that – you must be in the area because we're just in Sacramento, so we're not that far from San Francisco.
10438263	10443145	In fact, Alan is from there, so I go there all of the time, and I was there that weekend.
10443205	10446466	But GDC, they don't really let media people in.
10446946	10447907	So I didn't go.
10449048	10451570	They actually do have media passes.
10451710	10452931	You should try that next time.
10452991	10456574	Yeah, but unfortunately, it's kind of one of those double-edged swords.
10456694	10461157	Indie podcasters aren't really media enough for them.
10461497	10462018	Fair enough.
10462218	10467242	So you have to work for IGN or, well, I guess the media passes will be opening up next time.
10467722	10468022	All right.
10469203	10470504	So how was GDC?
10470524	10471005	What did you think?
10472396	10500053	um the conference itself was really awesome I'm an environment artist trying to get a job so for to go there it was basically a giant job fair you know with all the big companies and what not trying to hire people um but what was neat is that like all of the all of the different like Sony and Microsoft had booths there too showing off all their stuff and uh
10501650	10504231	Sony was showing off their PlayStation Move.
10504391	10505352	Did you get your hands on it?
10506373	10506673	Yes.
10507293	10508894	Ah, I want to know what you thought then.
10508954	10510335	I definitely want to know what you thought of Move.
10512055	10514697	I was out opening day picking up the Wii.
10514717	10516858	I was out there waiting outside for 14 hours.
10517939	10521741	And the Move puts the Wii to shame, hands down.
10522421	10523421	Wow, that's a pretty bold statement.
10523501	10526803	The controls for it were extremely responsive.
10526823	10528004	Yeah.
10529651	10535934	The demos that they showed were, it was a lot of really, really cheesy stuff.
10535994	10541797	Like there was a little game where you made bubbles and a monkey tried to pop the bubbles.
10542737	10552542	But as far as the controlling of it all went, it was very one-to-one, very, very quick and responsive.
10553142	10556244	Is that all you played was the monkey bubble game or were there other stuff that you got to check out?
10557426	10558947	There was the Monkey Bubble game.
10559267	10564291	There was that tech demo that they showed at E3 right when they showed it off.
10564331	10565092	They had that there.
10566173	10574459	And then they had some other game that I watched some girl play where she was swinging some swords and mallets or something around.
10575500	10577641	And she was getting really into it.
10577722	10582585	And it looked like it was very responsive as to what she was doing and all that.
10582605	10583426	Yeah.
10584807	10592947	They were showing that if you have the two controllers, the camera itself can actually do face tracking as well.
10594264	10615067	and so the camera can see your face and the two remotes and then guess where your arms are and all that and so it tries to do sensing where your body is and so if you're ducking and stuff like that it can try to replicate that with a character on screen.
10615447	10616508	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10635658	10647941	although, you know, I think we all see it as a logical step for Sony and we all know they've had more time now to perfect the technology, so it better be better but the big question is does it have the games to substantiate it?
10647981	10652662	Because, you know, if it's just another bunch of little mini party games and so forth, then what's the point?
10653062	10664345	Do you think, from what you observed, that Move has the, let's just go back to the old OLR golden rule a video game system is only as good as the games that are on it Do you think that
10665385	10668548	Move has the games to substantiate the controller.
10670310	10678216	From what they showed at GDC, they really only showed one game, like one full game with it, and I didn't really see much of it.
10678797	10690627	But I was talking to the guy that, like the main guy behind the whole technology of it all, and he was saying that the new SOCOM that's going to be coming out is going to be using it very in-depth.
10691987	10697588	and so he's saying that the controls for that are going to be pretty sweet.
10698408	10703329	So if SOCOM's going to be using it, I guess that's a really big title for Sony.
10704770	10708811	I don't have a PS3, so I don't know.
10709671	10715072	Then even better, is this the type of peripheral that makes you want to get one?
10716670	10717210	Kind of.
10717691	10721353	I've always been a sucker for the gimmicky crap in games.
10721673	10729918	I got the Game Boy printer, the e-reader, I bought the Wii opening day, all that kind of stuff.
10730779	10737022	And so this kind of thing, it does make me want to buy a PS3.
10739024	10740785	The guy said that...
10742043	10751288	As far as prices, the unit's going to come out with a controller, a game, and the camera all under $100 when it comes out.
10751508	10752069	Yeah, I remember that.
10752109	10754510	They did have a little press conference where they said some of that.
10754570	10757792	But yeah, I wonder if it's going to be the Monkey Bubble game or what it's going to be.
10759293	10759913	So we'll see.
10760353	10768945	Well, real quickly, before we let you go, because we want to get at least one more call tonight, were there any other quick thoughts you had about GDC or something really interesting?
10768965	10774613	Did you attend any panels or seminars or what have you that you just thought were awesome that you want to share?
10776028	10796583	um sadly I didn't get to go to any of the they call them summits there um I didn't get to go to any of those because I got the cheap pass which was still $250 right oh wow plus I live in Orlando so uh I didn't really have the extra oh you came all the way out here just for that then wow cool
10797321	10797701	Yep.
10799102	10803086	But what I will say is, if you don't mind a little plug here.
10803246	10804266	Go ahead.
10804807	10812273	I did a vlog every day as I was out there, recorded anything fun that I saw at the expo.
10813013	10819678	If you want to see any of that, I have a YouTube channel, youtube.com slash llama juice, all one word.
10819698	10821160	Yeah.
10822276	10826178	So if you go there, you can see a lot of the cool stuff they had at the expo.
10826298	10836644	They had a lot of virtual reality stuff going on, a lot of 3D glasses with gaming, a lot of stuff like that going on.
10836664	10839245	It was some pretty cool technology going on there.
10839648	10841449	Alright, so check that out on YouTube.
10842029	10848352	We'll go ahead and let you plug that, especially because we weren't out there ourselves, so I might actually be going to look and see what it was like out there on the show floor.
10848813	10856456	So, Lama Juice, good luck with Blur, good luck with your schooling for all the environmental stuff, and we'll see you later on the show, okay?
10857937	10858617	Sounds like a plan.
10858677	10859438	Alright, take care, buddy.
10860609	10861230	Yep, you too.
10861790	10862070	Later.
10862771	10867194	We'll take like one more call, guys, and I really apologize in advance for those folks that don't get through tonight.
10867254	10872639	Please, please, please don't be afraid to send us an email, send us some tweets, one of the other ways.
10872699	10877803	It's just that our show is running really long tonight, so we wanted to just take a couple more calls, you guys.
10877843	10878904	I'm just going to take this first one here.
10879304	10880245	Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio.
10880265	10880625	Who's this?
10881806	10882287	Good morning.
10882327	10883247	This is G-Ditz calling in.
10883468	10884088	Hi, G-Ditz.
10884248	10886130	Oh, it's the other Swede, right?
10887190	10887450	Oh yes.
10887851	10889133	Ah, how are you, my friend?
10889273	10889834	How's it going?
10891035	10891596	I'm not too bad.
10891957	10892557	A bit tired.
10892698	10893959	I've been up since 2am.
10894300	10896122	That is hardcore, my friend.
10896222	10896743	Hardcore.
10896763	10897284	It's always worth it.
10897304	10897704	Always worth it.
10898245	10899347	I really appreciate your support.
10899387	10900228	Well, what's on your mind?
10900348	10901910	Please, you've stayed up late to talk to us.
10901950	10902231	What's up?
10903956	10909859	You already talked about it, I think, but I just want to talk a bit more about Cave Story and its awesomeness.
10910679	10919983	If you haven't played it, you really, really need to play it, because it's freeware on PC, and if you really like it on PC, you can always buy it on WiiWare, because he really deserves it.
10920063	10923565	It's just one guy who made one of the most awesome games ever.
10925545	10926626	Where can people get this game?
10929255	10936760	Uh, I think there's a different, like a tribute site that has a download with an English patch, because the guy who made it is Japanese.
10937500	10937801	Oh, okay.
10937821	10941243	But I don't think he has his own, like, developer site.
10941323	10943284	It's Studio Pixel, I think he calls himself.
10943704	10945245	He's usually just referred to as Pixel.
10945745	10948207	Now, what's it about this game that just made you fall in love with it?
10949768	10957913	It's sort of retro, the music's awesome, the story's actually kind of entertaining, and it has a couple of twists.
10958666	10962228	It's not your usual Mario, oh, the princess is in another castle.
10962268	10963729	You can't really predict what's going to happen.
10964470	10968813	It's just an unexplored fantasy world that you've never seen before.
10971875	10973196	I like the price of free.
10973416	10973796	That's good.
10974076	10976558	Has anybody been able to follow the guy?
10976578	10986765	I know there's the language differences, but has anybody been able to follow the guy and see if there's a chance of this, I don't know, being an indie game on Xbox Live or coming out somewhere else besides just the PC?
10986785	10986865	Yeah.
10988167	10988567	I'm not sure.
10989287	11001691	It is coming out on WiiWare, and I think they had a report on the Wii Channel with him and the American developers who met with him and made the port.
11002531	11003312	But I'm not sure.
11003452	11008073	Maybe they have an exclusivity deal with Nintendo, because they probably want to keep that.
11008863	11011105	Maybe, maybe there's a WiiWare thing coming up.
11012105	11015428	And I do notice, by the way, speaking of WiiWare, I guess Dark Tetsuya is all excited.
11015728	11020511	I think La Mulan is released, must be tomorrow, because I can't think of what else Dark Tetsuya would be excited over.
11020972	11022153	But I know he's in there.
11022193	11028237	By the way, did you know, Dark Sakura, I know you've been busy with your stuff, but Rondo of Blood finally saw the light of day on Monday.
11028357	11031119	So part of me wants to hook up the Wii and get that.
11031579	11032120	You should.
11032480	11032760	I do.
11032900	11034621	I need to, but it's in a box.
11035562	11035822	Rob.
11036082	11036263	What?
11037103	11039304	You know how we were supposed to hang out last week and we didn't?
11039424	11039765	I know.
11040145	11040745	I can't this way.
11040765	11041586	I'm going to Boston.
11041686	11041946	I know.
11042166	11042826	I'm going to Boston.
11042866	11043547	When you're back.
11043647	11043887	Okay.
11044587	11045268	Rondo of Blood.
11045348	11047669	We need to do our show that we've talked about.
11048129	11048549	Yes, we do.
11048569	11049770	We can start with Rondo of Blood.
11049790	11050270	It would be fun.
11050330	11050851	Anyway, hi.
11050911	11051131	Yeah.
11051391	11052271	Sorry, listener.
11054733	11056173	Well, DarkSakura and I have an argument.
11057214	11060616	Jiditz, I guess I'll ask you, is there anything else on your mind tonight?
11062547	11066609	You said last time that you wanted to know the phrases in different languages from people calling in.
11066709	11066889	Yes.
11066909	11072531	So I thought I'd just... Saying like hi is just hey or hello.
11072851	11073411	Oh, that's easy.
11073591	11073891	Hello.
11073931	11074972	Basically hello.
11076012	11076292	Hello.
11076332	11077653	Yeah, hello.
11077673	11077773	Hello.
11078053	11078333	Hello.
11078653	11079593	Okay, I can do that.
11079893	11083055	And goodbye is like heydor.
11083695	11084095	Heydor.
11084995	11086196	Yeah, heydor.
11086416	11086856	Heydor.
11088812	11089172	Excellent.
11089532	11091693	Can you go out to the barn and close the hay door?
11093154	11093994	All right, I'll try.
11094775	11095095	All right.
11095195	11096316	No, I really appreciate that.
11096376	11103819	And now I need Aki Ripper to call in next, which, by the way, too bad we already did our game show tonight because you and Aki Ripper are both listening tonight.
11104319	11105460	We could have had a sweet off.
11105980	11112823	I know you already decided to bow down and let Aki Ripper have the title, but damn it, I wanted my sweet off.
11112983	11115845	But I guess it is to be for another day.
11116685	11118688	We are running way too long tonight.
11118768	11120510	I think we're like to three and a half hours at this point.
11120650	11121952	I almost have to go to school soon.
11122433	11123815	We gotta go and wrap this up.
11124035	11126418	You better get to school, young man.
11126758	11127940	We'll talk to you later, okay?
11129294	11131575	have a good one buddy same to you, bye
11158058	11161039	Alright, now's the part of the show where we wrap it all up.
11161099	11162920	I think we got all of Loki's last minute stories.
11163060	11164321	DarkSakura, I don't know if you had any.
11164341	11167842	I was mesmerized by reading about the healthcare passing.
11168122	11169863	Yeah, it's on a lot of people's minds today.
11169943	11173504	I don't want to get too political, but it's definitely a historical day.
11173704	11175065	It's a day that will be remembered.
11175245	11181687	I was just looking to find out what the specifics were because keep in mind all I've been hearing is all the crap from my Republican slash Libertarian family.
11182568	11189130	And while I have a good deal in common with the Libertarian platform, there are certain things that I think need to be done.
11189670	11193871	I'm not going to go into it, but I've been trying to see what exactly made it.
11194632	11195912	So what exactly is this again?
11195952	11197313	Is this that national health care thing?
11197353	11201094	Do I have to pay more taxes for people that don't have jobs so they can get their fucking health care?
11201694	11204055	Because that's what it seems like it's like anyways already.
11206046	11210953	I think they are going to tax the really high, high, high plans, like the Cadillac plans.
11211193	11212415	That was what I was just reading about.
11212435	11218664	If you have a really nice plan, you might, but if your plan has any deductibles or anything like that, it's probably not one of those plans.
11218684	11220747	Well, the biggest thing on here is that...
11222849	11238299	Instead of treating symptoms with excess drugs, basically the car dealer type of deal where you get more money for the options that go with it, then the focus will be on curing the problem and not the symptoms of the problem, not treating the symptoms, not getting a kickback for selling prescriptions, basically.
11239370	11240310	I will say this much.
11240370	11252313	I don't want to get too much into what I do for a living and to earn my paychecks, but I do work for a big healthcare company here in California, and I'll just say I'm really interested for work tomorrow.
11252553	11257294	It's going to be a heck of a day tomorrow, so I'm very curious to see what's going to happen.
11257434	11263175	But, you know, change is always inevitable, and I think this is one of those things that...
11265215	11267276	was going to happen, so we'll see what happens.
11267756	11283739	My only, I will just say this, my only concern about the whole thing is that I think that all of the other government programs need major revamping because I think that yeah, you can change one thing, but you really have to look at what the absolute root of the problem is, and I think that that's with the government itself.
11284839	11286520	I don't know necessarily that I trust them with my money.
11287380	11289860	I just hope we get a new trauma center game out of all this.
11289900	11290741	That's what I really want.
11290801	11292181	Trauma center, healthcare bill.
11292201	11292801	Laughter
11293976	11294577	Trauma Center Senate!
11312490	11327778	No, it was, it was like, you know, they're, they're playing the game or whatever and he's doing the apology and all of a sudden, you know, she comes up on stage and starts like beating him up with the, uh, with the golf club and she uses the prenup, uh, power up and stuff like that.
11327798	11328478	It was pretty funny.
11329955	11334236	I love SSJ100Matt's comment and I'm even going to make it my final thought tonight.
11334276	11340198	So we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought tonight and I'm going to leave it with what SSJ100Matt said because I think it's great.
11340558	11340978	Change.
11341518	11344139	It's always good because you can take it all to Coinstar.
11345279	11346459	Loki, your final thought tonight.
11347480	11348540	I need me some money.
11350333	11352014	Alan, thank you for being here on the show tonight.
11352234	11353895	I hope you got to say more than you did last time.
11353915	11354375	I think you did.
11354455	11355915	Participating in Listless really helped you.
11356295	11357816	Is there any final thought you have tonight?
11357996	11358696	I want tacos.
11359317	11359937	We'll get tacos.
11359957	11360537	We'll get you tacos.
11360557	11361758	You want Del Taco or Taco Bell?
11362198	11362678	Del Taco.
11362838	11363098	All right.
11363278	11363498	See?
11364379	11365579	Look what I've turned him into.
11365679	11368220	This Bay Area kid has fallen in love with Del Taco.
11368260	11368621	I love it.
11369301	11372262	Dark Sakura, thanks for strolling in late tonight.
11372302	11373002	We appreciate it.
11373062	11373603	It's my house.
11373703	11373963	I know.
11374003	11374363	I'm kidding.
11374403	11377564	If you don't like it, you get the fuck out.
11377664	11379425	Dark Sakura, your final thought tonight.
