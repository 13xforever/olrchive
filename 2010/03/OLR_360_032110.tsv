0	21160	Today, March 21, 2010, the Xbox 360 is set to get USB storage, GameStop test perks for
21160	29920	loyal customers, and what Playstation 3 add-on is selling out in Japan.
29920	37240	Hello, my friends, and welcome to episode number 360 of Orange Lounge Radio.
37240	39360	I'm having trouble speaking tonight.
39360	40680	This bodes well for tonight's show.
40680	43780	The video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.
43780	47680	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host,
47680	52120	not here right now, but will be here a little later, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie
52120	53120	Summers.
53120	57280	She's at another commitment right now, but she'll be here about 7, 7.30-ish Pacific time,
57280	59480	depending on when that is all over.
59480	63040	But never fear, I am joined by the one and only tech master, Loki.
63040	64040	Hello.
64040	65040	How are you doing tonight, Loki?
65040	66040	Doing fine.
66040	67040	Good.
67040	68040	At least he has chicken.
68040	69040	Once again, I noticed he stopped by KFC tonight.
69040	70040	Yeah, I don't know.
70040	71040	It sounded good again.
71040	72040	All right.
72040	73040	That's fine.
73040	74440	Also joining us tonight, we have a special guest.
74440	77200	He was here a couple of weeks ago, and he decided to come on back.
77200	79440	It is Salacious Pop, or Alan.
79440	80440	Hello.
80440	81440	How are you?
81440	82440	I'm good.
82440	83440	Yeah?
83440	84440	Yes, I'm going to try and talk a little bit more tonight.
84440	85960	You're going to try and talk more tonight.
85960	88600	Good, because you have to fill in for Dark Sakura because she's out.
88600	90480	But remember, those mics, not very sensitive.
90480	91480	So keep it.
91480	92480	Yeah.
92480	93480	A little stage fright last time I was on.
93480	94480	That's all right.
94480	95480	Tonight, you're going to be extra sassy.
95480	96480	Yeah, I hope so.
96480	99080	You're going to be our sassy gay friend on the show tonight.
99080	100080	A stupid bitch.
100080	101640	Have you seen those YouTubes?
101640	102640	Yes.
102640	103640	You didn't find them funny.
103640	104640	I'm not a fan.
104640	105640	Why not?
105640	106640	They're funny.
106640	107640	I don't know.
107640	108640	You're not a fan of the sassy gay friend?
108640	109640	Not their fan on Facebook?
109640	110640	Fine.
110640	111640	I think they're funny.
111640	112640	All right.
112640	113640	Forget it.
113640	120320	No, we tape live every week, of course, at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
120320	123240	It's 6 p.m. Pacific, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
123240	128960	If you're listening to us live, pull up a chair and join us in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com,
128960	132560	where we have the first comment tonight from Black Wolf, of course, our good pal who does
132560	136440	the show before us here at All Games, saying in our chat room, Sky broke into Dark Sakura's
136440	137440	house.
137440	139320	And X-Link follows that up with, Loki picked the lock.
139320	140880	No, Dan is here, folks.
140880	142440	Dan, the man let us in.
142440	144280	I didn't come until way later.
144280	148080	He's in the gaming vault right now, and I don't know what he's playing, but he's playing.
148080	150320	He was playing Otomedius Gorgeous.
150320	151320	Ah.
151320	153240	I sold my Japanese 360.
153240	154680	Oh, very cool.
154680	155680	Okay.
155680	158640	Yeah, I wondered why you brought a 360 to the show tonight, and I thought it might be
158640	163280	because this is episode number 360, and I was like, oh, are we going to take one apart
163280	164280	live on air?
164280	165560	And I was like, well, that's going to be shitty radio.
165560	166560	Could do that.
166560	167560	I have to.
167560	168560	Yeah.
168560	169560	It's not very exciting, but you could do that.
169560	173240	Yeah, especially when it's a radio show, it's more exciting to hear you bitch about the
173240	174240	guy that stole your 360.
174240	175240	How's that going, by the way?
175240	177240	The cops ever do anything about that?
177240	178240	No, not yet.
178240	179240	Sorry to hear it.
179240	180240	Bastards.
180240	181240	All right.
181240	183880	Well, we always start off the show with a little bit of how was your gaming week.
183880	186360	So tonight we'll start with Loki, usually ladies first.
186360	189360	But since there are no ladies, Loki will have to be our lady tonight.
189360	193760	I will not be your lady tonight.
193760	194760	That's okay.
194760	195760	Loki, how was your gaming week?
195760	200560	Very uneventful, actually, because I don't know what I was playing this week, but not
200560	204400	a lot of new things, I guess.
204400	206320	More Grand Theft Auto as usual.
206320	212080	Still not enough Grand Theft Auto, I think, because I find myself kind of in a flux as
212080	216200	far as going up the leaderboards, just because other people are playing it more than I am.
216200	219240	So I go up a lot and then I come back down.
219240	222520	And I go up a lot and come back down, because other people are playing it and getting ahead
222520	223520	of me.
223520	225000	So that's not a big deal.
225000	229000	My TrueSkill stuff, though, I occasionally lose a game to my co-workers.
229000	234520	And unfortunately, the level I'm at now, I'm so high that it knocks me down quite a bit
234520	236560	for just losing a game by like a few bucks.
236560	240120	Thankfully, though, I'm not going to allow that to happen anymore.
240120	242520	And so it's going pretty well.
242520	247640	I think I'm like ranked 75 now or something like that in TrueSkill, which is not bad.
247640	252560	This week, though, I am looking forward to being able to hopefully play against some
252560	256400	of the Rockstar employees, because I know they're going to be doing their event on Tuesday
256400	262280	during, like, I think it goes from 1 to 4 Eastern.
262280	264760	I'm not positive, but I think that's time frame.
264760	268760	Maybe, no, 4 to 7 Eastern, that's right.
268760	271600	Won the 4 my time.
271600	274800	So I'm looking forward to playing some of them.
274800	280360	And then other than Grand Theft Auto, I played more Final Fantasy XIII.
280360	285160	I finally made it to the second disc, now at Palimporum.
285160	291480	And weren't those, like, character names from, like, Final Fantasy II or something like that?
291480	296480	It's Palim and Porum, but the way they spell it in XIII is a little different.
296480	300360	But I kind of am convinced it is a nod a little bit to Final Fantasy IV.
300360	304080	Because I was like, hey, that's a name from something else.
304080	306440	And what is up with Cid being bad?
306440	309960	I mean, first off, Cid doesn't look like Cid.
309960	311200	OMG, spoilers!
311200	313680	There's supposed to be a six month moratorium on spoilers, remember?
313680	318600	Well, everybody knows that Cid doesn't look like Cid because they had pictures out there already.
318600	319160	Fine.
319160	319760	I figured that out.
319760	320320	Fine.
320320	322920	And, you know, and he may be evil, he may not be evil.
322920	326880	He still has an airship thing, some sort of ship.
326880	330000	But it's, like, emo Cid.
330000	332560	Wasn't Cid bad in XII?
332560	333480	I never played XII.
333480	334600	I can't remember.
334600	339920	I want to say I read, I didn't get far enough, honestly, but I want to say I read somewhere that he was bad.
339920	341000	XII.
341000	343160	And I know Cid never looks like Cid, but come on, man.
343160	346880	I mean, it's a stretch right now.
346880	348360	Whatever.
348360	351280	And then, what else?
351280	354400	So, yeah, it's kind of moving along.
354400	362240	And, you know, I'm to the point now where I'm just running past a lot of the battles because I just don't want to fight them anymore.
362240	363720	I just keep going.
363720	365600	Well, you can do that because you cheated.
365600	372080	You're a cheating cheater, and you put in some code that gives you the 99,000 damage every time you strike.
372080	377480	And the first thing Loki bitches about when he gets to your studio, I don't know why the game won't give me the trophy, because you're a cheater.
377480	379520	Cheaters don't win.
379520	382480	Well, I'll play it again, but I just won't cheat that way.
382480	384200	I'll do something else.
384200	384760	Yeah, right.
384760	388040	I think you're going to be like, oh, my arcade cabinet, or oh, Grand Theft Auto IV.
388040	392440	Speaking of cheating, though, that reminds me, I played more Borderlands this week.
392440	398720	I finally loaded up the new expansion a little bit, just because I'm trying to raise my level cap again.
398720	409600	And then we played a little bit of the zombie island of Dr. Ned, and that was kind of fun.
409600	415320	Of course, everything's level 30 right now, we're level 50, so it's quite easy.
415320	420120	But it's neat popping heads off of zombies and taking their brains.
420120	425000	And then, yeah, that's pretty much it, I think.
425000	426200	All righty.
426200	427920	Alan, how was your gaming week?
427920	429120	What kind of stuff you played this week?
429120	430360	Pretty good.
430360	433560	Played some Robot Unicorn Attack.
433560	434960	Was that inspired by OLR?
434960	436840	Yeah, kind of, yeah.
436840	445160	Lots of WoW, World of Warcraft, and oddly enough, a lot of Bejeweled and Peggle within World of Warcraft, so kind of meta.
445160	449360	Some Warcraft III, actually, going back to 2002.
449360	451200	Picking it old school in Warcraft III.
451200	456200	Blizzard just updated a patch for Warcraft III to fix some exploits.
456200	460520	Why now? I mean, it's so far out, it's like, why bother?
460520	462320	They're awesome and they support their games forever.
462320	464200	How long have the exploits been available?
464200	467600	Like, were the exploits just found a couple months ago or something?
467600	473800	I think they're just from the previous patch from a year ago, and I guess they're really obscure.
473800	480560	But yeah, there's so much lore in World of Warcraft that I just launched three to play a few missions from that for nostalgia.
480560	481840	So that's about it.
481840	483520	That's it for your gaming week?
483520	486840	Well, we played a bunch of games this morning.
486840	488160	You're going to let me talk about it, huh?
488160	489560	That's all right. I don't get into it.
489560	493400	You feel free to chime in, but I want to go to our chat room, chat.orangelauncher.com.
493400	498480	LiquidParrot says, I remember taking down Sky's high score in Bejeweled on Facebook by cheating.
498480	500080	Needless to say, it was frowned upon.
500080	503360	Yes, because cheating cheaters are rude.
503360	505280	Especially in multiplayer environments.
505280	509240	Like, I don't care that, I don't really care that Loki cheats on Final Fantasy 13.
509240	512040	Like, if he wants to ruin the game for himself by doing that, fine.
512040	513720	Have fun. I don't care.
513720	514680	Okay, but...
514680	516440	I've turned it into a more casual game.
516440	518560	Now I don't have to waste my time.
518560	522840	No, and you have managed to make it be nothing but cutscenes of Final Fantasy 13.
522840	524120	It's all it is anyway!
524120	526040	I was going to say, you took the...
526040	530080	You managed to take what little game there actually was out of Final Fantasy 13.
530080	532600	You're like, Odin battle? Ha!
532600	535720	Actually, the Odin battles, or the, um...
535720	539960	The battles against the summons are actually difficult still, because you have to do combo damage to them,
539960	542920	not necessarily damage damage to them.
542920	545560	So, it's still as difficult as it would normally be.
545560	546880	Everything else, so...
546880	548080	Right through it.
548080	550200	It's like, oh no, this monster's gonna be really hard.
550200	551080	Tap.
551080	552520	Okay, that's done. Thank god.
552520	555040	I don't wanna have to sit here for fifteen minutes.
555040	555840	Alright.
555840	556920	Uh, as long as...
556920	559520	Like, how long did it take you to get to that part in the game?
559520	560720	I'm only six hours in.
560720	562200	And that's how far...
562200	563320	Wait, and you're at Palimporum?
563320	563840	Yeah.
563840	564360	And you're six hours in?
564360	564760	Six.
564760	568400	I'm just about where you are, and I'm probably...
568400	570480	It probably took me about fourteen hours to get there.
570480	572160	I think I spent about the last couple hours in Palimporum.
572160	574000	See, that's how quick that, you know...
574000	577800	Oddly enough, I didn't play Final Fantasy 13 at all this week.
577800	579320	I've just been distracted with...
579320	581640	I don't know how many of you heard the call on Bobby's show tonight,
581640	583040	but I have a lot going on in my personal life.
583040	586400	Like, I'm gonna be changing my day job in the next couple weeks, which is big.
586400	588120	And then, you know, I just moved recently.
588120	590280	So, and then, you know, Boston's coming up too,
590280	594360	which, honestly, I haven't given as much thought to, but that is definitely on my mind.
594360	597120	So, I haven't had as much gaming time until the weekend,
597120	600800	when Alan and I just played a crapload of stuff this weekend.
600800	603400	So, sadly, I haven't really been in Final Fantasy 13.
603400	606080	And some folks in chat kinda arguing about the Odin battle.
606080	610000	I lost the first time, and then once I did the Libra...
610000	611680	And Alan can vouch for this, because he was there.
611680	614800	I did the Libra and read that he was weak to chain attacks, and I was like,
614800	617200	oh, just use a Ravage Ravage in your party.
617200	618080	Easy.
618080	620440	Well, they're all weak to chain attacks.
620440	621520	Well, him especially.
621520	623840	It said something like, I don't know, but for some reason that just worked.
623840	626400	Like, you just keep switching between Ravage and Medic.
626400	629360	And that's not really a spoiler, because the one thing I think a lot of people,
629360	631800	when they're first getting into Final Fantasy 13, sometimes forget,
631800	636240	and I'll just kinda put this pro tip out there, and then I'll get into other games this week.
636240	638640	Keep in mind when you're trying to fill a stagger bar.
638640	641360	Ravagers increase that bar quickly.
641360	643320	Commandos maintain it.
643320	645040	So, if you are trying to get, like, especially, like,
645040	647560	if you're in the part where you're fighting, like, the Metal Armadillos,
647560	649440	or whatever, that takes forever to kill,
649440	652640	remember that you can use a team of all Ravagers.
652640	656160	You just need to paradigm shift over and get a Commando in there once in a while
656160	658200	to make sure the bar doesn't drop too fast.
658200	661560	But then you can switch right back to Ravagers.
661560	665640	So, learning kind of the difference between the Commando and the Ravager is key.
665640	668440	Because honestly, their attacks, about the same amount of damage.
668440	670720	The Synergist is like a Red Mage.
670720	672640	Yeah, and your Synergist is a Red Mage, basically.
672640	675960	And, but Hope and Saws are completely different types of Synergists,
675960	676960	which is interesting.
676960	680600	Anyhow, I don't want to get too much into FongSC-13 spoilers,
680600	682360	because I know there's people that haven't even touched it yet,
682360	685400	but I'm trying very hard not to give story spoilers.
685400	689760	There's still that one little revelation I picked up on last week
689760	691760	that I'm like, I really want to find out if that's for real,
691760	694640	what I'm thinking, or if I'm just making shit up in my head.
694640	697040	There's another little twist that you figure out later on.
697040	699800	I like how the way they kind of addressed it, you know,
699800	701360	because you're like, way a second,
701360	703680	what's that person doing in that cutscene?
703680	705960	You know, that type of thing.
705960	708520	I, you will see, we'll see.
708520	709960	Ionotropic in chat wants to know,
709960	711720	how do you read the info after using Libra?
711720	713320	I hit the R1 button.
713320	715120	That's on PS3, I imagine.
715120	716440	It's the right shoulder button.
716440	718280	360, it's the trigger of the shoulder, yeah.
718280	719280	It's the slow button.
719280	722960	OK, other stuff I've actually been playing this week.
722960	725800	Quite a bit, thanks to The Weeknd and Alan being here.
725800	728960	OK, the one I know people in chat want me to talk about,
728960	732960	we had just a spur of the moment, impromptu battle
732960	735960	with Undersedation Live last night in Perfect Dark.
735960	738120	So the Saturday night show on all games,
738120	740400	Undersedation Live, Travis and Breslull,
740400	741280	it was their off week,
741280	743520	because they're bi-weekly right now,
743520	745800	or what is it, no, bi-monthly is when you're every other week
745800	748440	because they have Sakura Con on the horizon
748440	749800	and John's really busy.
749800	751560	So they're only every other week right now.
751560	752640	So this was their off week.
752640	755560	So they were on Perfect Dark last night really late.
755560	757280	And I kept getting all these messages,
757280	759480	like we signed on to play something else.
759480	761400	What were we playing last night on 360?
761400	763240	I don't remember, we started to play something else,
763240	764720	Rock Band, I think,
764720	766840	because we were gonna do the Gaga Pack and Rock Band.
766840	769440	So we started to get in and do that.
769440	771920	And then we get this message from John that was like,
771920	773760	dude, come play Perfect Dark with us.
773760	775320	And here's the thing that I have to admit,
775320	777040	like I know this is gonna surprise a lot of people,
777040	781040	but I never played Perfect Dark on the Nintendo 64.
781040	782640	Anyone know something else?
782640	784640	I never played Goldeneye either.
784640	787480	Like I watched people play it, but I never played it.
787480	788600	Don't judge me, OK?
788600	790440	There was other shooter games I played.
790440	793840	I played Doom, I played Quake, I played Duke Nukem.
793840	796880	I just never got around to playing Goldeneye
796880	800080	because I didn't get a 64 until really late in the game.
800080	801680	And by that point I just kind of bought it
801680	803920	from Mario Party and Pokemon Snap.
803920	804760	Don't judge me!
805800	808840	So somehow I never played Perfect Dark.
808840	812200	So, but they were like, you gotta get it, you gotta get it.
812200	814200	And I played the demo earlier in the day
814200	817000	before Alan showed up and I was kind of like, OK,
817000	819240	well, I don't know, I don't really get this.
819240	821200	Like I see how it's Nintendo 64
821200	822760	and it definitely looks like they put a lot of work
822760	824680	into the overhaul of this, but I don't know.
824680	828040	I just, I don't really get this, whatever.
828040	829080	But I'm like, it wasn't bad.
829080	830120	It was just, you know, I just,
830120	833320	I think this would mean more if I held in my memories.
833320	837520	So I finally, he berates me with a message.
837520	839360	Travis sends me a text message going,
839360	840800	you pussy, play Perfect Dark with us.
840800	842200	And then Misty's getting in on it.
842200	844480	Like people, just everybody's just berating me.
844480	845880	So I'm like, fine!
845880	847800	I will fucking come play Perfect Dark with you
847800	849480	and shoot you on the face.
849480	852360	So luckily enough, the Perfect Dark multiplayer
852360	854520	is cool enough where both Alan and I
854520	856520	could sign into our respective Xbox accounts
856520	859000	on the same console and play like the split screen.
859000	860160	And we were in a match.
860160	865160	So in the match was Travis, John, Misty, myself, Alan,
867800	870880	that Nick guy who I haven't talked to, but he was there.
870880	872840	Matt joined us for later matches.
872840	873680	And was that it?
873680	874880	It was like seven of us.
874880	877600	And so after Matt joins, he hooks up his soundboard
877600	880080	and he's playing like all these Duke Nukem sounds
880080	885000	through my speaker, like, oh yeah, and all these things.
885000	886640	Like, I'm just like, God damn it.
886640	888280	Everybody's laughing so hard,
888280	890200	partially because I think most of them were drunk.
890200	891600	Like I think John and Nick were drunk.
891600	892680	I don't know.
892680	894880	But so we had fun and I was running around.
894880	897200	Like I didn't know what I was doing, but I figured it out.
897200	899040	Like at first I was like, why can't I jump?
899040	900080	And I'm like, oh, that's right.
900080	900920	It's Perfect Dark.
900920	902440	You can't jump at Perfect Dark.
902440	905960	And I can't hate on it because you can't really jump in.
905960	908080	No, you could jump in Quake.
908080	909680	Could you jump in Doom?
909680	910880	No, you couldn't jump in Doom.
910880	912120	So, okay.
912120	913480	So I'm just like, okay, I have to approach this like Doom,
913480	916760	but you can and I figured out you can walk in the ladders
916760	918000	and go up ladders that way.
918000	920320	Like I figured that out after a few minutes.
920320	922960	And it was cool cause I got to like punch John
922960	925360	in the face a couple of times and it was fun.
925360	926200	It was fun.
926200	927960	And then there was this weird like clipping thing
927960	931520	that happened where somehow I ended up below Alan
931520	933040	whose character was on top of me
933040	935720	and I was punching him in the vagina repeatedly.
935720	937400	Cause I had no gun.
937400	939800	So it was like, I was just punching him in the skirt region.
939800	940640	And did I kill you?
940640	941480	I don't know.
941480	943080	I think, I think finally you like thought to look down
943080	943920	and shoot me in the head.
943920	944760	Yeah.
944760	945580	And I died.
945580	946420	It was sad.
946420	948280	So, but Perfect Dark was fun.
948280	949720	We had a blast playing that last night, actually.
949720	950880	It was, it was $10 well spent.
950880	952960	So I understand why people are all excited
952960	955480	cause it's, it's, it's a good multiplayer game.
955480	956560	Like everybody was having fun.
956560	958040	I felt bad for Alan
958040	959840	cause I only have the one wireless headset.
959840	960760	So I had that on.
960760	963040	And even though I had the mode on where you can, you know,
963040	966760	on your 360, you can do headphone and speakers.
966760	968480	You can't hear shit through the speakers.
968480	969300	You can't.
969300	970140	Like I think Alan,
970140	972160	could you hear anything at all coming through the speakers?
972160	973400	Yeah. Well the,
973400	975000	them talking through the TV speakers
975000	977320	along with the game effects, not really.
977320	978720	Like you can kind of tell people are talking,
978720	980680	but I had no idea what was going on.
980680	982000	And Matt's in chat right now going,
982000	984600	although Rob used his boyfriend as a decoy several times.
984600	987680	Well, what we thought to do later on is we were like,
987680	988500	is that you?
988500	989340	Yeah. Is that you?
989340	991040	Okay. Let's walk around together and try to find John.
991040	993800	And it's and assault him that way.
993800	995160	But that, that didn't work out very well.
995160	997720	Well, I was running around unarmed
997720	999940	just so that people could shoot me.
999940	1002120	So I wasn't really playing for real,
1002120	1003480	which is really sort of shitty.
1003480	1004680	Oh, sure. Sure.
1004680	1007400	Well, I had zero kills the last two matches.
1007400	1008960	You were letting us win Alan.
1008960	1009780	Of course.
1009780	1011480	I was just running around being stupid.
1012760	1015280	I don't like first person shooters on consoles.
1015280	1017080	I'll bring in my other wireless communicator.
1017080	1018660	Cause I have one of those.
1018660	1023200	We, I brought it into our game room area at work
1023200	1025360	so that we could talk to people
1025360	1027120	and berate them if we wanted to.
1027120	1029880	But instead my coworker decides to go ahead
1029880	1032040	and take it and say, I'm Loki.
1032040	1034320	I'm stupid.
1034320	1037920	I'm like, okay, you're not having that anymore.
1037920	1038760	Nice.
1038760	1040560	I love you such and such player.
1040560	1042160	It sounds very dark.
1043160	1044600	I'm like damn you.
1044600	1045440	Nice.
1047200	1048040	Oh, I'm sorry.
1048040	1050120	You hate first person shooters on consoles.
1050120	1051880	Yeah. So I can do it,
1051880	1054680	but I'm more of a stickler for the mouse and keyboard.
1054680	1056520	So I was being stubborn.
1056520	1057360	I was being stubborn.
1057360	1058180	That's right.
1058180	1060460	Because you're like a half-life geek.
1060460	1061840	That's something I have to remember.
1061840	1063960	You like half-life is like God to you, right?
1063960	1064800	Yes.
1064800	1067560	Okay. So all this other stuff is crap.
1067560	1068640	All right.
1068640	1071480	But have you ever played the orange box on 360
1071480	1073400	or is that like sacrilege to you?
1073400	1074880	I downloaded the demo for it,
1074880	1078040	which is the beginning of half-life episode two on the 360,
1078040	1080440	just to, you know, played it for about half hour.
1080440	1082280	Decided I didn't like the controls.
1082280	1084200	Okay. So you're one of those PC elitists.
1084200	1085040	That's fine.
1085040	1085920	That's cool.
1085920	1086960	All right. So other gaming week.
1086960	1089080	So then we played rock band.
1089080	1090600	We finally got around to playing the Gaga songs
1090600	1091440	in a rock band.
1091440	1092960	And I'll say this cause I sent it to Bobby on his show.
1092960	1094000	Cause he was talking about how he bought
1094000	1096160	the Eric Cartman poker face.
1096160	1098880	That poker face Cartman thing is the kind of thing
1098880	1100680	that's like funny once.
1100680	1102880	Like I couldn't see myself playing that song over
1102880	1103720	and over again.
1103720	1104680	Cause I liked the song.
1104680	1106160	Like it's funny once,
1106160	1108880	but if you have a lot of people that come to your house
1108880	1111920	to play rock band, like you throw the rock band parties,
1111920	1113400	it's, you know, it's going to,
1113400	1115880	somebody inevitably is going to pull that song up
1115880	1118160	at a party and go, I want to sing the Cartman poker face.
1118160	1119200	Ah ha ha ha.
1119200	1122560	But we played it once and we were like, ha ha next.
1122560	1124760	Well, you can at least do like a South Park medley
1124760	1126640	at least now cause you've got a couple songs.
1126640	1127480	Timmy, right?
1127480	1128320	Yeah.
1128320	1129400	And then we, then we squealed
1129400	1131840	cause we were able to play bad romance.
1131840	1132680	Let's see.
1132680	1134840	Ah, then what else today?
1134840	1137480	Okay. So today, what did we do?
1137480	1138800	We fired up the 360 and I don't know,
1138800	1140240	do we have intention on playing anything?
1140240	1141080	I think we were like,
1141080	1142800	let's find something co-op that we can both play.
1142800	1143640	Yeah. Right.
1143640	1144960	So I'm looking through my game collection
1144960	1147040	and we get to beautiful Katamari and I'm like,
1147040	1147880	you know what?
1147880	1149040	I didn't play this game that much
1149040	1150080	cause I didn't really like it,
1150080	1152120	but I hear it has co-op and versus.
1152120	1152940	So let's try that.
1152940	1154720	Cause maybe that'll make the game more fun.
1154720	1156100	So we pop it in and by the way,
1156100	1158120	I don't have a second PS3 controller.
1158120	1159880	So we had to do 360 today.
1159880	1161960	So just so you know.
1161960	1163760	So we put in beautiful Katamari and I'm like,
1163760	1165000	okay, let's do co-op mode.
1165000	1166240	And I was kind of surprised.
1166240	1168020	Oh, it's not split screen.
1168020	1170540	Oh, we're controlling the same Katamari.
1170540	1172840	So Alan and I are trying to play
1172840	1176960	and we just keep rolling the Katamari in a giant circle.
1176960	1180800	Like, and there's nothing on the screen to tell you
1180800	1182700	like so-and-so is tilting the wrong way.
1182700	1185160	It's just, it was bad.
1185160	1186400	Like there was nothing to do.
1186400	1188600	It just splits the twin stick controls
1188600	1189860	between the two people.
1189860	1192600	And it's, yeah, I wasn't feeling it at all.
1192600	1193440	No, it was terrible.
1193440	1194960	After like 30 seconds, Alan was like,
1194960	1196480	turn it off, turn it off.
1196480	1197960	So he decided to do versus.
1197960	1198800	Cause it's like, okay,
1198800	1200360	I've seen a picture of a split screen
1200360	1201460	on the back of the box.
1201460	1206160	I know this has to have like a two player true mode in it.
1206160	1208560	Sure enough versus is split screen.
1208560	1210120	And when we were going to the stage select,
1210120	1211040	we're like, oh, home.
1211040	1211880	I'm like, okay, cool.
1211880	1213760	It's going to be like, who can make the biggest Katamari?
1213760	1214580	This will be fun.
1214580	1216180	Okay, now this will be great.
1216180	1219960	No, the battle was roll up the most clothes pins
1219960	1221720	in one minute, go.
1221720	1224960	And it's like this generically square playing field
1224960	1226880	with a bunch of clothes pins.
1226880	1228560	And it was roll up as many as you can.
1228560	1231640	And he tried to crash into the other Katamari once in a
1231640	1233160	while and make them lose clothes pins.
1233160	1236680	And so we play that and I was like, this is not fun.
1236680	1238620	So we decided to play the world.
1238620	1240480	I'm like, okay, let's do the hardest stage
1240480	1241600	and see what it is.
1241600	1245040	So it was now you're in a much bigger square playing field
1245040	1247320	and you're going to roll up houses.
1247320	1248600	And I was like, this is shit.
1248600	1250720	Like I think I literally said after it was over
1250720	1252160	and it's not just because Alan beat me,
1252160	1253200	but I was like, this is shit.
1253200	1254200	And I threw my controller down.
1254200	1255080	It was shit.
1255080	1256060	It was not fun.
1256060	1258640	Like a versus Katamari game should be so much better.
1258640	1260800	I don't know if they got it right on PS3.
1260800	1263320	You know, I, even in the single player mode,
1263320	1265400	the PS3 is the better game than the 360.
1265400	1267780	And that has nothing to do with the consoles themselves.
1267780	1269600	Don't start the console wars with me.
1269600	1271120	It's just that for what, you know,
1271120	1273400	beautiful Katamari came first and they made mistakes.
1273400	1275200	So maybe they fixed them with the PS3 one.
1275200	1278320	I don't know, but the PS3 Katamari forever
1278320	1281060	or whatever is superior to the 360 one.
1281060	1284800	Now I haven't even played the co-op or versus.
1284800	1289200	So after that was terrible, we decided to go into arcade.
1289200	1290660	And we were just kind of looking through arcade games
1290660	1292720	to play and I was like, okay, Alan, what do you want to play?
1292720	1294040	Like, what don't you have yourself?
1294040	1295720	And he's like, oh, you have double dragon.
1295720	1296560	Let's play that.
1296560	1297400	I'm like, okay.
1297400	1300200	Like I think I played this for like five seconds
1300200	1302040	when I first downloaded it back when I would just
1302040	1304260	download arcade games to download them.
1304260	1307400	Like you saw how many arcade games I have on 360, right?
1307400	1310920	It's and then you cry thinking of all the starving children
1310920	1312720	that I could have fed with that money, yeah.
1312720	1317720	So we go into play double dragon and I don't know, Alan,
1317920	1319680	can you, it's.
1319680	1321960	That game does not stand to the test of time.
1321960	1324680	That game is terrible.
1324680	1326220	It's terrible.
1326220	1328720	I feel bad for all of the $5 bills
1328720	1331360	that I extorted from my mother and grandmother.
1331360	1332680	This game's really hard at the, you know,
1332680	1336080	at the arcade little nine year old me playing a bad game.
1337000	1337940	It's awful.
1337940	1340000	It's one of those games I think we really see
1340000	1342200	through rose colored glasses or whatever they call it.
1342200	1343800	Like remember better from our childhood.
1343800	1346360	Like I, and I don't know if it's just the 360 port
1346360	1350400	or whatever, but there's fricking slow down and flickering
1350400	1352880	and the game is just fucking cheap.
1352880	1355100	Like, like don't press down too much.
1355100	1356640	You're going to fall off the edge.
1356640	1360040	And it's like this horrible collision detection in the game
1360040	1362560	and then finally, when we got to the end,
1362560	1365940	we had to battle each other to see who got
1365940	1368660	the big titty girl and it was like the worst fight
1368660	1371320	in the entire world that we did.
1371320	1373960	And finally I somehow won, even though Alan hit me
1373960	1375880	with a baseball bat like 50 times,
1375880	1378340	all I did was I had to pull his hair a few times and I won.
1378340	1380580	Yeah, I'm pretty sure that the three punches
1380580	1382840	does way more damage than the baseball bat
1382840	1384280	because I hit you about eight times.
1384280	1386760	Yeah, so we played our way through double dragon
1386760	1388640	and we were like, what the hell are we thinking as children?
1388640	1391180	This game was better, it was better on the NES, honestly.
1391180	1393180	I would rather play the NES version of double dragon
1393180	1394760	than the 360 version and that's awesome.
1394760	1395680	The NES version was awesome.
1395680	1397480	Yeah, although now I'm worried.
1397480	1399480	I'm like, God, I wonder if I'm just remembering
1399480	1401640	that one more fondly than I deserve to or what.
1401640	1405000	No, it's just like Contra, like Contra on the arcade.
1405000	1407860	I didn't really care for it, but on the NES it was cool.
1407860	1410400	Vidpower in chat says 50,000,
1410400	1413000	you scored 50,000 points on double dragon
1413000	1414840	from the movie The Wizard.
1414840	1417640	Dude, if you can score like 50,000 points on double dragon,
1417640	1419160	that actually is really impressive.
1419160	1421560	Like I have a lot of respect for a gamer that can do that
1421560	1424520	now after seeing how fucking cheap that game is.
1424520	1427200	Like I kid you not, the last boss will shoot you
1427200	1430500	in the back with a gun and you will die instantly.
1430500	1432360	Insert quarter to continue.
1433280	1435700	Like what the hell, no wonder they removed that game
1435700	1438100	from Xbox Live Marketplace, it was bad.
1438100	1440560	So then I said to Alan, I was like, well fuck it,
1440560	1442720	let's just make it a bad game day.
1442720	1445760	And so that's when I reached for Fusion Frenzy 2.
1445760	1448560	Yes, the game I spent $60 on when it first came out,
1448560	1450220	I decided to pop it in because I'm like, Alan, no,
1450220	1453540	you have to see how fucking terrible this game is.
1453540	1455640	So we played like what, for, which by the way,
1455640	1457840	if you've never played Fusion Frenzy 2,
1457840	1460440	it's kind of like Xbox's answer to Mario Party,
1460440	1463040	but with a more like science fiction future theme.
1463040	1466320	So we flew to the planet Moisture to do some battle
1466320	1467160	in some water.
1467160	1469020	No one should ever fly to the planet Moisture.
1469020	1472480	To do some battle in some water themed stages.
1472480	1474940	And Alan, what were your thoughts on Fusion Frenzy 2?
1474940	1477380	It was emotional abuse and I'm upset
1477380	1478980	and I need to call a shelter.
1480240	1482260	Gamer's spouse abuse.
1484080	1485520	What was so bad about it?
1486880	1491200	Just the host was in like his pink jumpsuit
1491200	1493960	with the spiky hair and you could tell that it was sort of,
1493960	1495920	you know, edgy, like designed by committee.
1495920	1499160	And it was really just sort of the showgirls of party games,
1499160	1501000	but without any of the breasts or anything
1501000	1502360	that makes showgirls great.
1502360	1505400	It was awful.
1505400	1507440	Dude, showgirls of party games be awesome.
1509440	1510360	Wait, wait, Dan, Dan, Dan,
1510360	1511600	we got to get Dan on mic with that.
1511600	1514000	Can you hand Dan the mic real quick?
1514000	1517080	My Double Dragon score is 68,920.
1517080	1518280	Can I shake your hand, sir?
1518280	1519200	I want to shake your hand.
1519200	1521120	You are a gaming stud, sir, Dan.
1521120	1521960	Now, Dan.
1521960	1522780	I have to say for the record,
1522780	1524600	I'm listening to you guys talking here.
1524600	1526500	Your opinions about games are all crap.
1527760	1529720	The arcade Contra is awesome.
1529720	1531280	I like Contra.
1531280	1532440	Double Dragon rules.
1532440	1533280	Wait, wait, wait.
1533280	1534440	When did I say shit about Contra?
1534440	1535280	I did.
1535280	1536120	Oh, you did.
1536120	1536940	Loki did.
1536940	1537780	Well, fuck Loki.
1537780	1538620	All right.
1538620	1539600	Double Dragon rules.
1539600	1541560	Double Dragon sucks.
1541560	1542920	It has slow down.
1542920	1544240	It has flicker.
1544240	1545460	It's cheap.
1545460	1547240	The weapons don't do shit.
1547240	1548200	Yeah.
1548200	1549760	It's all about the elbow punch.
1550840	1551800	But you are right.
1551800	1554040	There are no good Katamari games except for the first one.
1554040	1555000	What other games?
1555000	1556760	I will say this, to Double Dragon's credit,
1556760	1559480	there are no other games where you get assaulted
1559480	1562160	by transsexual bitches carrying whips.
1562160	1564080	Like no other game do the trannies come out
1564080	1565640	and force you to try to kick your ass.
1565640	1567420	Like I can't, I can't think of any.
1567420	1568520	Streets of Rage 2.
1568520	1573520	Yeah, very good point, yes.
1573720	1574880	Fine.
1574880	1577320	Yet again, I get upstaged by Dan on this fine program.
1577320	1578160	Fine.
1578160	1579480	OrangeLawnsRadio.com.
1579480	1580560	All right, let's see.
1580560	1581380	So what else?
1581380	1583400	What capped off our bad game day?
1583400	1584240	Oh yes.
1584240	1586400	I told Alan, I said, okay.
1586400	1590240	I said, this game is literally worse than Yaris.
1590240	1591840	And Alan goes, Yaris?
1591840	1592680	Like the car?
1592680	1593520	That's a car.
1593520	1594340	That's a car, right?
1594340	1596680	And I'm like, yeah, it's a car,
1596680	1598840	but don't you know the game Yaris?
1598840	1601000	And he's like, no, they made a game out of Yaris.
1601000	1602840	I'm like, turn off the,
1602840	1605040	we gotta go to the arcade right now
1605040	1607080	and play Yaris right now.
1607080	1609200	And the minute you launch the game Yaris,
1609200	1611400	for those that forgot because it's been a few years
1611400	1613400	and I'm gonna bring back all your haunting memories
1613400	1614220	of the past.
1614220	1617160	The game starts with a Yaris like driving,
1617160	1619500	or no, no, there's like a little robot spider on the ground
1619500	1622560	and then it pans out and a big Yaris drives in
1622560	1624940	and a robot claw comes out of the hood
1624940	1627140	and like zaps the robot spider.
1627140	1630520	And I look over at Alan and Alan just has this like,
1630520	1631360	what?
1631360	1632200	Look on his face.
1632200	1634160	I thought it was like a Pixar intro,
1634160	1636400	like a cute car animation.
1636400	1638400	Like, all right, this is the opening sequence of the game.
1638400	1639300	No, that is the game.
1639300	1643140	You're shooting, you're shooting little gas pump spiders.
1643140	1646640	Yeah, so then I made Alan, I made him play a race.
1646640	1648920	I was like, no, you need to play a really bad game
1648920	1649760	and see what this is like.
1649760	1651600	So I made him play a race and that's when he started going,
1651600	1653240	this is rape, this is emotional rape.
1653240	1655080	I don't like it, this is bad.
1655080	1659300	And then, yeah, so what'd you think of Yaris?
1660660	1664280	I am very happy to hear that it was free.
1666600	1671180	And for promotional purposes only, so.
1671180	1672960	And then finally, once that was over,
1672960	1675640	I redeemed myself with some Fatal Fury special.
1675640	1676980	So I got something good in.
1676980	1679360	And not only is it bad in the fact that the game
1679360	1682480	is just horrible and of poor quality,
1682480	1684680	it also is bad in the fact that it led the way
1684680	1689560	to pirating Xbox Live arcade games on modified consoles.
1689560	1691060	Thank you, Yaris exploit.
1693120	1693960	All right, that's-
1693960	1696220	So there is no good redeeming value about that game
1696220	1698520	other than the fact that it can make the bottoms
1698520	1700680	of worse lists and stuff like that.
1700680	1705200	Um, yeah, I don't know what else to say about that.
1705200	1706440	I mean, it's kind of funny though,
1706440	1708440	because we also, somehow we forgot to mention,
1708440	1709840	we were playing Puzzle Fighter II
1709840	1710660	over the weekends on my own.
1710660	1712840	That's a game by Backbone Entertainment, did that game.
1712840	1714620	They also did Yaris, and you're kind of like,
1714620	1716600	my, my, how the mighty have fallen.
1718220	1720280	But I guess everybody's allowed one crappy title,
1720280	1721120	I don't know.
1721120	1723400	I randomly played Boom Boom Rocket again today too.
1723400	1725080	I don't know, I realized I was missing
1725080	1727120	one stinking achievement in that game.
1727120	1729080	So I kind of went back to go see if I could get it
1729080	1731300	and it involved playing some very hard songs.
1731300	1733160	But apparently I'm still number one on my friends list.
1733160	1734000	Woo!
1734000	1736160	So I don't know, I'll have to go in
1736160	1737360	and try to play that a little more.
1737360	1740880	Cause I, the last time I had played Boom Boom Rocket
1740880	1742640	was probably two and a half years ago.
1742640	1746120	So, anyhow, let's get into some gaming news here
1746120	1747560	and some housekeeping.
1747560	1749280	Real quick, of course, if DarkSakura was here,
1749280	1750920	you know, she's not here to tell you about her gaming week,
1750920	1752680	but I'm sure she would say something like,
1752680	1756940	I played Star Trek Online and Pagle on my iPhone.
1756940	1759200	And yeah, all right.
1759200	1762600	Anyhow, we'll let her talk about her gaming week
1762600	1763600	when she gets here.
1763600	1764640	Housekeeping tonight.
1765680	1767120	First off, I want to give a big thank you
1767120	1770320	to some of the people behind the scenes at OLR.
1770320	1771560	I mean, obviously we have a lot of people
1771560	1773360	behind the scenes that make things work.
1773360	1776200	Deep Man and VX JasonXV who do the website.
1776200	1778240	But also Dark Tetsuya does a lot of work
1778240	1780840	for kind of like writing on the website once in a while.
1780840	1782800	And I know Act F does some work with him as well.
1782800	1785680	And I know Dark Tetsuya and Misty kind of got together
1785680	1789680	for this side project that is the OLR best hits.
1789680	1792360	And it's the greatest hits, if you will,
1792360	1794080	of like our first 20 episodes.
1794080	1795240	And when I mean our first 20 episodes,
1795240	1799760	I mean the first 20 episodes from 2002
1800880	1803080	back when we talked about nothing but DDR.
1803080	1805900	So it's done, it's up, and you can download it.
1805900	1807880	The only thing I want to warn you about,
1807880	1810400	it was a totally different show back then.
1810400	1814080	And also something that I think they didn't mention
1814080	1816080	in the audio, which is fine.
1816080	1820160	But when we started the show, our live 365 feed,
1820160	1821460	because you know the all games partnership
1821460	1825200	didn't happen till like 06-ish, 07 maybe?
1825200	1826840	I can't, gosh, time flies.
1826840	1828720	But so when we first started our show,
1828720	1831760	we were on our own live 365 station.
1831760	1836200	And we were running a modem friendly, dial up friendly,
1836200	1838040	56K friendly radio stream.
1838040	1840960	So the audio quality was not that great.
1840960	1843040	So I just want to warn you, if you're gonna go check it out,
1843040	1845080	keep in mind, the audio may hurt your ears a little bit
1845080	1846700	because it was dial up friendly.
1846700	1848000	But if you want to hear the kind of stuff
1848000	1850120	we talked about a year ago, it's pretty cool.
1850120	1850960	So I really want to-
1850960	1851780	A year ago.
1851780	1852920	I'm sorry, years ago.
1854920	1856760	I want to thank Dartisia for putting that together.
1856760	1859000	It's pretty funny.
1859000	1861280	All right, you can find that at orangelaundraded.com.
1861280	1862880	It's right there on the front page.
1863880	1865180	Other housekeeping tonight.
1865180	1867440	We do have a list list coming up in part B tonight
1867440	1870180	because it is our 360th episode.
1870180	1873480	So we have a list list tipping our hat to the Xbox 360
1873480	1874080	tonight.
1874080	1876760	So we'll get into that a little later on in the show in part
1876760	1879080	B. But if you want to vote, you have
1879080	1883120	to be in our chat room, chat.orangelaundraded.com.
1883120	1885280	All right, let's get into some actual gaming news.
1885280	1886920	Because Alan and I have been talking
1886920	1888640	about a lot of old games.
1888640	1891240	So let's get into some new games and, oddly enough,
1891240	1892160	some 360 news.
1892160	1893080	Yes, Loki?
1893080	1896320	Yes, this week we had some images leak out
1896320	1900240	of a possible slimmed down 360.
1900240	1904520	And much like images leaked out before of a 360
1904520	1909480	with an HDMI port on it, I have to say this is probably
1909480	1910640	going to happen too.
1910640	1913000	And it kind of coincides with a lot of other stuff
1913000	1915260	we'll probably be talking about a little bit later.
1915260	1921280	But it shows, obviously, there's a couple new internal plugs
1921280	1923480	for SATA cords and stuff like that.
1923480	1926140	So it's thought that perhaps the hard drive is
1926140	1929020	going to be internal, much like the PS3.
1929020	1932680	Also, they've combined the GPU and CPU into one chip.
1932680	1936080	And it's got an actual kind of a different cooling system now,
1936080	1940320	just more like a traditional heat sink and fan.
1940320	1944040	Also, the memory card slot is missing.
1944040	1945720	But once again, that kind of gets
1945720	1948760	into something we'll be talking about probably
1948760	1951200	a little bit later.
1951200	1952280	But it's interesting.
1952280	1953480	And I have a feeling this is probably
1953480	1955160	going to be out by the end of this year.
1955160	1956840	I will bet you anything.
1956840	1960840	Probably around the same time as Project Natal.
1960840	1961600	Yeah, definitely.
1961600	1963640	I think it'll come out in conjunction with Natal.
1963640	1965240	I bet it'll be announced at E3.
1965240	1967040	Do you think Natal's built into this thing?
1967040	1967800	No.
1967800	1968640	I don't think it is.
1968640	1970960	I think it's going to be just an accessory.
1970960	1973760	I just think the system's going to be slimmed down kind
1973760	1977560	of to appeal to more of like the Wii crowd type thing.
1977560	1980360	Maybe they're going to drop the price on it or something.
1980360	1982040	Now what's the source of these pictures?
1982040	1983960	Because I want to try and figure out how true this is.
1983960	1985540	Because remember guys, this is a rumor.
1985540	1987640	So what's the source of these pictures?
1987640	1991720	The source, it's apparently from some Chinese tech forum.
1991720	1996760	Apparently it was, I'm thinking that it's probably
1996760	1999080	leaked from some sort of production line.
1999080	2004040	The same type of forum leaked up some other revisions of.
2004040	2007120	Yeah, I seem to remember the first PS3 slim info
2007120	2008920	was coming from an Asian web forum.
2008920	2012400	Because that's what the factory was making some of the parts.
2012400	2012880	Yeah.
2012880	2014200	And there's some things on here.
2014200	2017480	I mean, you'll notice there's like developer headers
2017480	2021000	on there, these on the current 360s
2021000	2023800	are where people do the JTAG exploits and stuff like that.
2023800	2026560	Obviously this will probably be fixed on this console
2026560	2028720	when it comes out.
2028720	2031600	Stuff like that and different like power headers and whatnot
2031600	2034720	that are, I mean this one looks like the CD-ROM or the DVD
2034720	2036320	drive and then probably they're going
2036320	2039880	to have one that's going to plug into the SATA drive
2039880	2041160	if it's going to be internal.
2041160	2043440	So it's interesting.
2043440	2046800	OK, so Loki, on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being this
2046800	2049640	is a fucking lie and 10 being this is fucking happening.
2049640	2050680	How true is this rumor?
2050680	2052200	I'd say it's probably 10.
2052200	2054800	That's a pretty big bet, all right.
2054800	2057080	Well, it's where there's smoke, there's fire.
2057080	2059880	And yeah, I realize that we're only a few weeks away
2059880	2061600	from April Fool's Day, but come on.
2061600	2064000	I mean, it just makes sense that they would do this.
2064000	2066680	And like I said, with the other news that's coming out,
2066680	2069640	it makes sense why certain things are missing from this.
2069640	2072040	So yeah.
2072040	2074520	Spyro in our chat room, chat.orangelandrater.com
2074520	2076520	says, we already have normal 360s.
2076520	2078280	We don't need slimmer ones.
2078280	2080040	Yeah, that's what the PS3 people said too,
2080040	2081760	but now they have slim PS3s.
2081760	2083320	And it was the best move they made.
2083320	2087000	Well, they made the cost of the console cheaper
2087000	2089080	by consolidating some parts and taking
2089080	2091600	some things that weren't really used very commonly out.
2091600	2094520	What did they take out of the other PS3 model?
2094520	2095040	Was it USB?
2095040	2097120	They took out USB ports and stuff like that.
2097120	2108160	But yeah, it's just slimmer dies and parts get cheaper.
2108160	2109540	Well, and that's my other thought
2109540	2112560	is that, OK, part of why I think there is a lot of truth
2112560	2114360	to this is that it makes sense that they're trying to
2114360	2116520	consolidate some of the parts because you're talking
2116520	2117520	about a price reduction.
2117520	2120480	Because how awesome would it be if Microsoft
2120480	2123960	gets the price low enough where they can launch a 360
2123960	2127640	console with Natal for $199?
2127640	2130520	So that's what they charge for their low-end 360 now, right?
2130520	2131360	$199?
2131360	2134400	What if they could do that with Natal for $199?
2134400	2138080	I mean, that's a pretty big kick in the pants to Nintendo
2138080	2139440	come this Christmas season.
2139440	2143040	Although if that were to happen, it's not out of the question.
2143040	2146920	Nintendo might say $99 a week.
2146920	2148960	It might not make a difference.
2148960	2150460	So I think right now at the point,
2150460	2152800	I mean, $99 a week would be kind of cool
2152800	2154040	because then people will be like, oh, yeah,
2154040	2155240	I'm going to definitely pick up one of those.
2155240	2157320	But picking up a system doesn't mean you're
2157320	2158560	going to buy the games for it.
2158560	2160400	I mean, look at all these people that
2160400	2163080	bought just the Wii for Wii Sports.
2163080	2165360	And that's all they're playing.
2165360	2167180	And they're not buying Wii Sports Resort.
2167180	2168760	And they're not buying anything else.
2168760	2171560	They're just playing Wii Sports.
2171560	2175440	Or like me, I haven't played the Wii in months.
2175440	2177680	Neither have I. In fact, I was going to hook it up this week
2177680	2179880	to play Rondo of Blood, which for some reason
2179880	2180920	is on our show all night.
2180920	2184040	It finally got its release on Monday, which is exciting.
2184040	2186080	It's because Jamie's not here for part A tonight.
2186080	2187360	So that's how we missed it.
2187360	2188920	But Rondo of Blood came out.
2188920	2191100	And I was like, oh, I should hook up the Wii and download it.
2191100	2193600	But then I was like, let's play terrible games on the 360
2193600	2196120	instead for whatever reason.
2196120	2198400	So I don't know.
2198400	2200240	Alan, I know you already own a 360.
2200240	2202320	But do you think there's anything here
2202320	2206080	that maybe somebody who already has a 360
2206080	2207360	might want to get one of these?
2207360	2208900	Do you think there's anything in here
2208900	2212480	for us gamers that probably already have one?
2212480	2217000	Maybe to trade up so that hopefully the Red Ring of Death
2217000	2218840	isn't an issue.
2218840	2220600	Well, the rumor is that these are going
2220600	2222880	to be 45 nanometer chips.
2222880	2224200	So those are pretty stable.
2224200	2226720	I mean, heat wise, it uses a lot less electricity,
2226720	2227880	a lot less heat.
2227880	2230720	And it looks like the way that they have it right now,
2230720	2232440	if it is going to be slimmer, it's
2232440	2236240	literally going to be heat sink fan opening to the case.
2236240	2240020	I mean, there's no elaborate ducting system
2240020	2242160	with fans blowing air and stuff like that.
2242160	2245880	It's just, it's straight out of the case.
2245880	2249400	So I mean, I would assume it's going to be more stable.
2249400	2251560	I mean, even the new consoles now are more stable.
2251560	2255520	So there may be a little bit of bugs worked out.
2255520	2256840	But we'll have to see.
2256840	2258600	And hopefully they've learned their lesson.
2258600	2261860	They're going to test their consoles quite a bit.
2261860	2263480	I just think it's going to be interesting
2263480	2266160	if they do decide to put an internal hard drive in there.
2266160	2268440	Then I wonder if they're looking to say, hey,
2268440	2270280	we're not going to try to make tons of money
2270280	2272080	off these hard drives now.
2272080	2274160	Because I would assume that maybe you
2274160	2276400	can upgrade your own hard drives.
2276400	2278600	And even if you can't, I mean, the modding community
2278600	2281240	out there, now that it has the standard SATA ports on it,
2281240	2283720	you're going to be able to upgrade your own hard drive.
2283720	2285400	Out of curiosity, could this, you know,
2285400	2286400	you brought up modding.
2286400	2289240	And you've talked a lot about the different mods out there,
2289240	2291460	like the J tags and so forth, the 360s.
2291460	2293600	Do you think part of this is to combat modding?
2293600	2294200	Maybe.
2294200	2296320	I mean, because the J tags stuff right now,
2296320	2299920	I mean, they've already patched it out.
2299920	2303960	It's just you have to have an old enough,
2303960	2306520	basically an old enough firmware to be able to run it.
2306520	2309760	And a lot of the consoles now are,
2309760	2311520	especially the ones being released now,
2311520	2313680	have firmwares that you can't drop back down.
2313680	2317220	But they're figuring out how to mod different consoles.
2317220	2320440	Because there's the ones that had the old 16 megabyte,
2320440	2325240	or yeah, the 16 megabyte NAND flash, now the ones
2325240	2327880	that they've added, like the 256, the 512,
2327880	2331200	to the newer consoles that they have actual onboard memory
2331200	2332680	cards almost.
2332680	2335880	Those now, they're figuring out how to mod as well.
2335880	2339900	But a lot of them aren't with an old enough dashboard
2339900	2342000	to be able to do it.
2342000	2344640	I mean, I'm sure they're going to find a way to do something.
2344640	2346440	At the very least, they're going to find
2346440	2348800	ways to add a bigger hard drive if you want it.
2348800	2352200	But they may actually, if they're smart,
2352200	2353920	go the route of Sony and allow you
2353920	2355800	to upgrade your own hard drive.
2355800	2356680	Well, we'll see.
2356680	2358680	Because I think we have another story coming up
2358680	2362200	about further evidence that the Xbox 360 hard drives may
2362200	2363200	be a thing of the past.
2363200	2365720	But first, I want to get into another story about the 360,
2365720	2368880	since it is episode 360 of our show, after all.
2368880	2370320	Talking about a patent.
2370320	2371320	Yes, that's right.
2371320	2373160	Thanks to the US Patent Office and people
2373160	2375480	having to file those patents to protect their ideas,
2375480	2378720	sometimes we get spoiled on things that may or may not
2378720	2380440	actually end up happening.
2380440	2382440	I think we've seen patents in the past.
2382440	2384520	Didn't Nintendo trademark like, or I
2384520	2385840	mean, I guess there's a difference between trademark
2385840	2386340	and patent.
2386340	2390240	But for the purposes of rumor spoiling, it's very similar.
2390240	2393760	Didn't they trademark like a bunch of names for that system
2393760	2395280	that ended up being the Wii?
2395280	2397240	You know, like a lot of times they do this.
2397240	2398960	They trademark a bunch of ideas, just
2398960	2404200	make sure there's no, God, those people that just like.
2404200	2405080	Patent squatters.
2405080	2406240	Patent squatters, thank you.
2406240	2407240	Or trademark squatters.
2407240	2409120	Yeah, that was looking for the people that,
2409120	2411240	oh, we invented the rumble thing first,
2411240	2413080	even though we never did anything with it.
2413080	2417320	And all those people to try and get to the ideas before them.
2417320	2419640	Well, anyhow, this, though, sounds very feasible to me.
2419640	2422400	And this is a Microsoft patent that apparently was filed back
2422400	2425560	in mid 2008.
2425560	2429720	What would happen is that with this thing, this interface,
2429720	2432000	I guess, that they're patenting, you would actually be able
2432000	2435960	to download a game add-on from the Xbox Live Marketplace
2435960	2439400	when an in-game prompt in the game tells you to do so.
2439400	2443200	Believe it or not, that doesn't really happen right now.
2443200	2444760	You know, the game will kind of say,
2444760	2446720	especially if you're playing a demo,
2446720	2450320	you can hit a button to kind of go to the Xbox Live store,
2450320	2451960	but there's like some extra steps
2451960	2453760	that you take before you actually purchase.
2453760	2454920	And this sounds a little more to me
2454920	2457640	like you would just be able to buy the add-on right there,
2457640	2460640	practically with a touch of a button, if you had the.
2460640	2464000	It would be like, for example, I was playing Borderlands
2464000	2466520	and, you know, say my friend was playing
2466520	2467760	and he wanted to join my game
2467760	2469880	and he doesn't have the expansion that I have,
2469880	2471120	and then it'll say.
2471120	2472320	And I want to clarify, I'm sorry,
2472320	2474040	but this is an important point of the trademark
2474040	2478400	is that the content that you buy is required
2478400	2481120	for a particular online game they attempt to launch.
2481120	2484080	So Loki's Borderlands example, if, you know,
2484080	2486720	your friend has this expansion that you're trying to play,
2486720	2488440	then you could buy it at the touch of a button.
2488440	2491000	Or I'm thinking the big one would be Rock Band.
2491000	2493040	Like that would be huge because, you know,
2493040	2494240	oh, we want to play this song.
2494240	2495480	Oh, I don't have that song.
2495480	2497280	Press X and you will buy the song
2497280	2499700	with your imaginary money that's actually real money
2499700	2501600	that got turned into imaginary money.
2503000	2505000	And that's what you pay for with Microsoft system.
2505000	2506200	Like it would be that easy.
2506200	2508840	I'm imagining other things like Game Room
2508840	2511100	would kind of tie into this too.
2511100	2512200	I was trying to think of,
2512200	2513160	I was trying to come up with this.
2513160	2514600	I was trying to explain to Alan yesterday
2514600	2516320	and I don't think my point really came across very well.
2516320	2519520	I was like, I think Game Room is kind of like Rock Band.
2519520	2521360	I think Game Room kind of has a lot in common
2521360	2522520	with Rock Band.
2522520	2526680	It's a system that's really gonna make their bucks
2526680	2529720	off of all these microtransactions is, you know,
2529720	2531640	where, you know, well, obviously they're not making
2531640	2533280	any money off of the shell of the game.
2533280	2534960	And it's kind of like, well, yeah,
2534960	2537280	you pay $40 up front for Rock Band,
2537280	2538760	but you get all these default songs.
2538760	2541640	But for Game Room, you pay zero, you get nothing,
2541640	2543360	but the whole thing's out of microtransactions.
2543360	2545720	It's actually like, a better comparison would be
2545720	2548920	that Game Room is more like that PSP demo
2548920	2550120	for Rock Band Unplugged.
2550120	2550960	You remember that?
2550960	2553920	They came with like one song and all the rest
2553920	2556320	would play just DLC is all it would play.
2556320	2557160	Yeah.
2557160	2560120	It's almost kind of like that, but for classic games.
2561000	2563740	So anyhow, but that might be another one.
2563740	2565520	Hey, you go visit your friend's Game Room
2565520	2568560	and they wanna play you in a battle of, I don't know,
2568560	2570520	what's a two player game, Contra or something.
2570520	2571880	You know, even though you've already bought that
2571880	2573320	on Xbox Live some time ago.
2573320	2576800	Well, you could press X and you can buy Contra
2576800	2579840	for 300 Microsoft points and go to town.
2579840	2581240	So it's just making it easier to spend
2581240	2583440	your imaginary money, essentially.
2583440	2587840	So yeah, and you don't have to quit the lobby to do so.
2587840	2590780	That's another important thing too, is that sometimes
2590780	2592720	if you wanna buy an expansion, you have to back out
2592720	2594440	of the lobby, go back to the menu, do this all,
2594440	2597180	no, it would be a lot faster this way.
2597180	2599760	So I don't know, is this dangerous?
2599760	2604200	Is this something that maybe they shouldn't be implementing
2604200	2606760	because it makes it almost too easy to download games?
2606760	2608280	Or what?
2608280	2610960	Or is this just a logical, yeah, this is more
2610960	2612720	of a give me your money type of step?
2612720	2614000	I think it's just, it makes sense.
2614000	2615240	It makes it more streamlined.
2615240	2616840	I mean, you don't have to do it,
2617700	2620720	but I don't know, it makes it easier.
2620720	2622720	I would worry that there's like 13 year olds
2622720	2624020	that are gonna sit there and hit the button,
2624020	2626160	but hopefully their parents know about parental controls
2626160	2627960	and there's no credit cards on file.
2627960	2632880	iTunes and Amazon already have one click purchasing
2632880	2636040	where you can just, with one click, buy TV, whatever.
2636040	2639440	So just to have that, for Xbox to have that
2639440	2641860	in their marketplace, I mean, other online stores
2641860	2644160	have already, are already doing this, so.
2644160	2645000	That's a good point.
2645000	2647560	You know, and iTunes, I remember some time ago,
2647560	2650560	I used to have, it was before they made the big upgrade
2650560	2653040	to the engine, what are they on right now, 7.0?
2653040	2655460	I think it was right when they upgraded to 7.0.
2655460	2658480	On my old iTunes, whenever I would click buy a song,
2658480	2660240	it would go into a shopping cart.
2660240	2662280	Well, they got rid of the shopping cart completely,
2662280	2664200	which I think is kind of bullshit.
2664200	2666360	And what you do now is if you click,
2666360	2667960	you don't click on buy song,
2667960	2670320	but you click on the little dropdown next to that
2670320	2672320	and you click add to wishlist.
2672320	2675500	And they say that the wishlist replaced the shopping cart.
2675500	2678060	But I think the way they did that was really shady.
2678060	2680180	Like, I hate the way that Apple handled that
2680180	2682680	because I'm so used to being able to click the big button
2682680	2684280	and it just goes to my shopping cart.
2684280	2686620	And then, you know, when I, maybe once a week
2686620	2688800	or once every other week, I would just buy the cart
2688800	2691320	because what I would do, here's what I used to do a lot.
2691320	2695500	I would play online games and I would listen to online radio
2695500	2697060	while I played the games.
2697060	2698920	And if there was a song I liked
2698920	2699980	that they played on the radio,
2699980	2702440	I would go into iTunes, search for the artist right there,
2702440	2703640	add the song to my cart.
2703640	2705700	And like at the end of the week, I'd download all the songs.
2705700	2707040	I have a new CD for my car.
2707040	2708440	Like it was an awesome system.
2708440	2709840	But then when iTunes switched it up,
2709840	2713080	so now it's just click and you buy right away,
2713080	2714840	I thought that kind of was shady.
2714840	2716720	Like, yeah, they have the wishlist,
2716720	2719260	but come on, Apple fans.
2719260	2721840	They made that harder to get to.
2721840	2724500	They made it harder to have a queue.
2724500	2727100	They made it easier to buy a game right away,
2727100	2729680	which was kind of crappy in my opinion.
2729680	2730880	But that's a good point, Alan,
2730880	2734500	is that this system already really exists in other places.
2734500	2737880	And there's no, even without Microsoft Bucks on iTunes,
2737880	2739200	it's real money.
2739200	2740600	Good point.
2740600	2741440	All right.
2741440	2742480	Well, let's move on with some more stories.
2742480	2743400	Loki.
2743400	2744240	Yeah.
2744240	2747200	So one of the new updates that's gonna be coming soon
2747200	2750880	is USB storage support for the Xbox 360.
2750880	2753400	Finally, you're gonna be able to just use
2753400	2757720	your stupid jump drives or whatever to save your games
2757720	2760320	versus having to buy the really expensive memory cards,
2760320	2764120	which the last I checked was the 512 megabyte card,
2764120	2766280	half a gig, for 50 bucks.
2766280	2768160	And I just bought one of those memory cards
2768160	2768980	not that long ago,
2768980	2770440	although I don't think I bought the half a gig one.
2770440	2772200	Maybe I did, but it only cost me 20 bucks.
2772200	2773640	Whatever I bought was 20 bucks,
2773640	2775160	and it came with Geometry Wars,
2775160	2776920	which I tried to give to Alan,
2776920	2779400	but you couldn't take it off the memory card,
2779400	2780360	which was stupid.
2781300	2782280	That is dumb.
2782280	2787280	But thankfully, you will be able to use your
2788740	2791980	USB memory cards to go ahead and save your games.
2791980	2794080	You can do download content, save games,
2794080	2798500	games in demand, title updates, et cetera, indie games.
2798500	2801660	And the thing is, though,
2801660	2805840	you will only be able to use cards up to 16 gigabytes,
2805840	2810840	meaning you can't just plug in say a USB hard drive
2811000	2811840	or something like that.
2811840	2813040	That's 120 gigs.
2813040	2816080	Or those fucking terabyte drives now.
2816080	2817440	You just bought one of those not that long ago, right?
2817440	2819200	How much should I set you back?
2819200	2821120	For the one terabyte USB drive?
2821120	2822840	Yeah, about 110, 120, yeah.
2822840	2824480	It's disgusting how much data
2824480	2826080	you can take with you on the go now.
2826080	2827600	So I mean, at the very least,
2827600	2832600	you can store say, just without using a USB hub,
2832600	2836040	you know, a good almost 60 gigs on there.
2836040	2838880	I mean, now I'm assuming,
2838880	2841760	I don't know if you can use like USB hubs on this,
2841760	2843680	but maybe you could even plug in more drives
2843680	2845240	if you really wanted to.
2845240	2850240	But the way that whole thing works is really weird
2850580	2852700	because I don't know if people know this,
2852700	2855860	you could plug in your iPod into the 360
2855860	2857400	and play songs off of it.
2857400	2860180	And those drives are much larger than 16 gigs.
2860180	2862560	It seems like if it's a media thing,
2862560	2864720	you're only using it for like media files,
2864720	2866800	that it doesn't care how large the storage is.
2866800	2868520	Yeah, well you can play movies today.
2868520	2870800	You can play a movie or a music file off a USB stick.
2870800	2871660	Yeah, you can do that,
2871660	2874320	but you can't store stuff from a 360.
2874320	2876000	You can't transfer like saves or anything.
2876000	2876840	Correct.
2876840	2879260	And that's what this is basically gonna allow you to do.
2879260	2883040	However, this also once again plays into what we saw
2883040	2887840	with the supposedly slim 360 motherboard.
2887840	2889300	There is no memory card slot.
2889300	2892600	There's just the front USB port, the back USB port,
2892600	2894040	and that's it.
2894040	2896020	So it makes you think, okay,
2896020	2897660	so they're just gonna use USB storage
2897660	2899080	if you wanna do like a memory card.
2899080	2900880	And I think that's a good idea
2900880	2903400	because to be honest, the Microsoft storage
2903400	2905680	is really, really overpriced
2905680	2908400	and their hard drives are really overpriced.
2908400	2910560	So I do hope that they allow users
2910560	2912640	to use their own hard drives
2912640	2914220	or have it come with a hard drive
2914220	2917800	and just allow you to upgrade it later on
2917800	2919560	if they're still gonna sell their crappy
2919560	2920380	overpriced hard drives
2920380	2924360	because I mean, hell, it's $200 now for like a 100
2924360	2927920	or I think it's like $200 for a 120 gig hard drive
2927920	2930960	or maybe not $200, but it's over $100
2930960	2932880	for a 120 gig hard drive, which is retarded.
2932880	2935160	But you could buy a one terabyte USB drive
2935160	2936120	10 times the storage.
2936120	2938360	Yeah, one terabyte, yeah, drive
2938360	2940720	that has a USB connection on it.
2940720	2943080	So it makes no sense that they would just,
2944020	2945140	I mean, it makes sense for them
2945140	2946360	because they're making a lot of money off of it
2946360	2947880	because they're locking out everybody else.
2947880	2952080	But I mean, really, there's cheaper solutions out there
2952080	2953560	if you open it up.
2953560	2955920	Well, I think, and I'm reading in our chat room
2955920	2958680	at chat.orangewonstrated.com, YYR says the limit
2958680	2961200	will be two drives according to reports.
2961200	2965320	But even then, take two 16 gig drives, that's 32 gigs.
2965320	2967380	That's still quite a bit.
2967380	2969520	I mean, yeah, it's not as big as 120 gigabyte,
2969520	2972400	but that's enough for most of you guys.
2972400	2974640	Like if you don't do video on the 360
2974640	2977140	and you don't install a lot of games,
2977140	2978160	you're in good shape.
2978160	2980480	And honestly, I don't know how much good it would do to,
2980480	2982140	well, I take that back.
2982140	2983200	Do you think it would do a lot of good
2983200	2984880	to install a game to a USB stick
2984880	2986740	as opposed to just doing it on a regular hard drive?
2986740	2989200	I guess the difference would be unnoticeable.
2990040	2990880	But I keep thinking.
2990880	2992120	I would think maybe the USB drive
2992120	2993260	might be a little bit faster.
2993260	2995040	It's hard to say because the hard drives
2995040	2997520	that are in there right now, they're just,
2997520	2999440	I wanna say they're 5,400 RPM.
2999440	3003580	They're really, I mean, they're standard
3003580	3005240	for a laptop drive, but when you're talking
3005240	3008160	about like desktop drives, they're 7,200.
3008160	3009580	It's obviously a little slower.
3009580	3012800	And it's also flash, so there's really no moving parts.
3012800	3015680	So really, you'd be limited by the speed of USB 2.0,
3015680	3017320	which would probably be, I would say,
3017320	3018520	faster than that drive.
3018520	3020240	The chat room is lighting up with some comments,
3020240	3021540	and I wanna say some of these.
3021540	3023800	The chat is reminding us that the 120 gig hard drive
3023800	3024960	is no longer there.
3024960	3027240	Spyro says the 60 gigabyte is left.
3027240	3029000	That's it, nothing else.
3029000	3032080	Bresloh wants to say, the reason the HDs are overpriced
3032080	3034360	is because of the drive manufacturers found out
3034360	3035680	what the hard drives were for,
3035680	3039240	and they decided to screw a lot of money out of MS.
3039240	3040080	True story.
3044040	3046800	That's a dumb excuse, I'm sorry.
3046800	3047640	Well.
3047640	3049480	If they're gonna screw you out,
3049480	3052160	screw you for those hard drives,
3052160	3055060	just use different hard drives.
3055060	3057480	All right, well speaking of dumb excuses,
3057480	3060320	let's go to another completely different type of story here.
3060320	3063280	This is a story that has to do with GameStop,
3063280	3065680	and it also has to do with console shortages,
3065680	3067600	and apparently GameStop has commented
3067600	3071480	on the recent Wii shortages and PlayStation 3 shortages,
3071480	3073700	and they are saying that those shortages
3073700	3076440	do not look like they are coming to an end very soon.
3077400	3079880	There's a quote here from Tony Bartell,
3079880	3082320	who is the executive VP of merchandising for GameStop,
3082320	3085040	saying, quote, they could sell a lot more hardware
3085040	3087880	than what we have on both the PS3 and the Wii platform.
3087880	3090520	They are saying it is not gonna end until early summer
3090520	3091560	is when this is projected to end.
3091560	3092400	And then by then,
3092400	3094320	they're gonna have another console iteration,
3094320	3097680	and it's just gonna be the same damn thing all over again.
3097680	3098800	Just to clarify,
3098800	3102520	they say the Wii is supposed to get the resupply first,
3102520	3105200	and he thinks this is all because of the surge
3105200	3108520	of the sales of the consoles from the last holiday season.
3108520	3110460	I've heard a different theory, though,
3110460	3111640	and that has to do with,
3111640	3113360	and was it you who was telling me this, Alan?
3113360	3114720	Somebody was telling me this
3114720	3117040	about the whole fiscal year that plays into this.
3117040	3119760	That was you on a previous show.
3119760	3120600	The fiscal year,
3120600	3122360	did you think the fiscal year's playing into this
3122360	3123680	on both Nintendo and Sony?
3123680	3125520	I don't know, they're just dicking around, though,
3125520	3127080	right now is what I know,
3127080	3129320	because first party anything from Sony
3129320	3131700	is like damn hard to get right now.
3132960	3135760	So who knows what the situation is,
3135760	3140080	and unfortunately, they could be sending them to retailers,
3140080	3141400	but apparently retailers are saying
3141400	3142240	they're not getting them.
3142240	3143840	I just have a hard time believing three months
3143840	3145840	after the holiday season,
3145840	3147920	and I mean, the holiday season was pretty good to them,
3147920	3149440	but come on.
3149440	3151160	I mean, it's not like,
3152200	3154040	there's no way you're that short.
3154040	3157080	You know, you would prepare for the holiday season
3157080	3161200	by ramping up production prior to the holiday season.
3163000	3167620	I just don't see why you would, you know, not.
3167620	3171680	Well, and how many freaking like PS3s
3171680	3174680	are being sold right now?
3174680	3176240	I mean, it just doesn't seem like
3176240	3177600	it's as in demand right now.
3177600	3180240	Maybe for birthdays and stuff, but that's it.
3180240	3181520	A lot of them might have to do with the fact
3181520	3182840	that they're hard to find right now,
3182840	3187040	but I'm sorry, I mean, how many years has it been now?
3187040	3188800	Just because it's not on shelves now
3188800	3191220	is not making a demand for, you know what I mean?
3191220	3193400	People aren't like trying to find them
3193400	3195640	like they were when it first came out.
3196520	3197960	People are waiting, they're just like,
3197960	3200640	oh well, I can't find it now, I'm just not gonna buy it,
3200640	3203140	because I don't have the money, or you know,
3203140	3208140	times are tough, they're trying to purposely hold them back
3210040	3212320	to create this sort of demand for the console,
3212320	3213400	that's pretty dumb.
3213400	3215440	People are seeing right through it now.
3215440	3218400	I, just while Loki's been talking here,
3218400	3220480	I pulled up BestBuy.com just to see,
3220480	3222040	because they'll let you do a store search
3222040	3223460	to see what the inventory looks like.
3223460	3226340	Just so you know, they have a couple packages available.
3226340	3231340	There's a 299.99 Sony PlayStation 3, it's the slim,
3231340	3234680	so it's like the slim by itself, it's the 120.
3234680	3237360	It is sold out online, and if you go into it
3237360	3239160	to do like a store search, it won't even let you.
3239160	3240960	It says store pickup, not available.
3240960	3242300	So that is gone.
3242300	3246740	Now there's a 349.99 console, 250 gig.
3246740	3249480	You can buy it online, but then there's this red thing
3249480	3251600	that says not available for shipping.
3251600	3255940	So I guess you could maybe only do the in-store pickup.
3255940	3258680	Well I did a search around the local zip code here,
3258680	3262000	and the six closest stores in the Sacramento area,
3262000	3263600	Citrus Heights, Arden Fair, Folsom,
3263600	3266920	Roseville, Natomas, Elk Grove, all out, unavailable.
3266920	3270040	So the shortage is real, there's no disputing that.
3270040	3274040	But it's weird why that this is happening.
3274040	3276720	And like I said, the theory,
3276720	3280120	and it could be just someone talking,
3280120	3285000	but the theory is that they're holding them until April,
3285000	3286480	when their new fiscal quarter starts,
3286480	3289160	because maybe either they've hit their numbers
3289160	3292000	that they want this year, no point in really trying
3292000	3294160	to boost their numbers, but for next financial year,
3294160	3297160	maybe they wanna really try to boost their numbers.
3297160	3298000	I don't know.
3298000	3299920	The thing that seems ridiculous to me right now
3299920	3303200	is that two of the biggest PlayStation 3 games
3303200	3306100	that could have been system sellers are out now.
3306100	3310380	Final Fantasy 13, although granted, the whole 360 thing,
3310380	3313480	you know, if gamers want it, and they have a 360 already,
3313480	3314360	they can just buy it there,
3314360	3317080	and I know there's been a lot of back and forth
3317080	3318300	about which version is better,
3318300	3320740	but there's no difference, you guys.
3320740	3323080	The differences are minuscule, so just drop it.
3323080	3324440	I'm wondering on the audio, though,
3324440	3327320	a question just to go on the Final Fantasy real quick,
3327320	3328240	and this is totally random,
3328240	3330320	but how's your audio sounding on that?
3330320	3334740	Do their voices sound kind of metallic, I guess, to you?
3334740	3335580	I mean, I know-
3335580	3337680	No, but that could be your sound setup.
3337680	3338520	You don't necessarily-
3338520	3340020	But I have surround sound headphones,
3340020	3342440	and I've done everything to try to configure it
3342440	3343840	so that the sound sounds okay,
3343840	3345860	but it still sounds kind of metallic.
3345860	3346700	Seems okay to me.
3346700	3348880	Like it's heavily buffered or something.
3350380	3351740	Well, also, I do want to say, though,
3351740	3353860	the other big game that's out,
3353860	3356280	God of War 3 came out this week, hello?
3356280	3357600	That is a system seller.
3357600	3359240	That is one that people will run out
3359240	3361820	and buy PlayStation 3s for, but they can't,
3361820	3364440	and there's no God of War 3 bundle or nothing,
3364440	3366400	and that really surprises me.
3366400	3370940	That seems just not smart to have your big game out
3370940	3372360	and not have the systems to back it up,
3372360	3373760	especially if it's intentional.
3373760	3377120	If it really, truly is an unintentional shortage,
3377120	3379120	then okay, whatever, just bad luck.
3379120	3382440	But if it's an intentional shortage, that was dumb.
3382440	3384880	Then they should've delayed God of War 3,
3384880	3387760	saying, you know, quality issues or whatever.
3387760	3389480	They would've lied and said it was a quality thing
3389480	3390720	or something.
3390720	3393640	It's what they have coming out from first party for Sony
3393640	3394940	in the next couple months.
3394940	3395780	Not much.
3395780	3399140	I mean, they have ModNation Racers, but that's in May.
3399140	3404140	And then after that, well, that's it.
3404180	3406260	So, ModNation Racers, which I don't think-
3406260	3408060	Well, and then the move is-
3408060	3410180	But that's not until the holiday, I mean.
3411700	3412540	I don't know.
3413740	3416020	All right, well, Loki, you have a little more,
3416020	3417440	speaking of GameStop, right?
3417440	3420020	Yes, they're still evaluating
3420020	3423340	the Customer Loyalty Opportunity Program.
3423340	3425920	Apparently, you may remember there was a survey
3425920	3427900	that went out a while back saying that,
3427900	3430560	you know, they're gonna have different tiered programs
3430560	3432840	where you can maybe buy into it or whatever
3432840	3436520	and you get certain discounts, perks, et cetera.
3436520	3440440	Apparently, you know, GameStops, you know,
3440440	3442040	they've commented that we're in the process
3442040	3445040	of evaluating loyalty opportunities for our customers.
3445040	3446880	As this is a work in progress,
3446880	3449080	we're not gonna comment on any speculation
3449080	3451740	to changes to our edge card program.
3451740	3454760	And then they continue to go and comment on
3454760	3457340	changes that are gonna happen to the edge card program.
3457340	3460340	They're gonna be testing in foreign markets.
3460340	3465340	Apparently, there's a French gaming chain named Micromania
3467240	3469400	during the GameStop conference call.
3469400	3471000	And I'm wondering if Micromania
3471000	3473000	may be owned by GameStop now.
3473000	3475880	They may have, yeah, they were bought out.
3475880	3479240	It says, we believe that the loyalty program at Micromania
3479240	3482320	drove some of the highest sales per store
3482320	3483900	in Europe that we've seen.
3483900	3485720	So we think it's a very effective program
3485720	3488180	and that's the base for what we added
3488180	3491440	to our existing loyalty program here at the edge.
3492280	3497040	So let's see, some of these different perks
3497040	3498900	they're gonna have here, they're saying,
3498900	3502680	so Micromania had the MegaCart program for many, many years.
3502680	3503920	It's probably the most successful
3503920	3505960	video game loyalty program in existence.
3505960	3508840	If you look at Micromania, as we did early on,
3508840	3510900	you know, 86% of their transactions
3510900	3513920	have a MicroCart ID associated with them.
3513920	3517440	MicroCart is not only a loyalty program,
3517440	3520080	it becomes a launch device in a vehicle.
3520080	3521940	It becomes a marketing vehicle.
3521940	3524760	It even helps you decide where to put a new store
3524760	3528040	as a real estate vehicle.
3528040	3531560	We believe that the loyalty program at Micromania
3531560	3533680	drove some of the highest sales per store in Europe
3533680	3534800	that we've ever seen.
3534800	3536320	So we think it's a very effective program
3536320	3537680	and that's the base, of course,
3537680	3539800	what they're gonna use for the edge program.
3539800	3541220	How theirs will be different,
3541220	3544100	our program will be heavily built on heavily
3544100	3545320	what you see at Micromania today,
3545320	3547760	but it will add some very significant pieces.
3547760	3550880	Our marketing team has done some extensive surveys,
3550880	3555880	like we saw linked online, let's see here,
3556280	3559120	of kinds of rewards that customers are looking for.
3559120	3560920	If you recall one of the previous,
3560920	3563440	or one of our conferences,
3563440	3566780	the fact that we did an internet survey,
3566780	3568400	had to shut down the response engine
3568400	3571400	because it was so much, or there was so much interest
3571400	3573760	in the GameStop loyalty program.
3573760	3575160	Ours will have different rewards.
3575160	3579300	It won't be purely a markdown program
3579300	3582200	that gives discounts once you reach a certain threshold.
3582200	3585480	It will also have unique rewards like tickets to shows
3585480	3589060	and early entrances to midnight launch, et cetera.
3589060	3591680	So we think that builds on what they have
3591680	3592720	for Micromania now.
3592720	3596680	So the four markets, they didn't really say
3596680	3597760	where they're gonna start it,
3597760	3602680	but I would imagine it's gonna be some pretty random markets
3602680	3603520	that they're gonna put them in
3603520	3606200	because usually it's not their top markets, so.
3606200	3608120	I feel like when you're reading a story like this
3608120	3609680	about GameStop and their programs,
3609680	3611800	I should be playing like a song like this.
3611800	3616640	We can try that.
3616640	3618740	Could you try reading the press release again?
3618740	3620360	Yes.
3620360	3623360	So we think that it builds on what we have for Micromania,
3623360	3626520	but it really adds lots of sophistication,
3626520	3631480	and consumer insights to monetize that GameStop consumer
3631480	3633280	and brings unique rewards
3633280	3634960	that only GameStop can bring you.
3634960	3636660	Resistance is futile.
3639200	3641940	Join us in our rewards program.
3648040	3649160	Oh yeah.
3649160	3650440	All right, seriously though.
3650440	3652920	I mean, is there enough here to really get that customer?
3652920	3655120	Well, they were as if they needed to stomp out
3655120	3656280	more of their competitors.
3656280	3658720	They're completely vague in that, though,
3658720	3660640	so that's the thing is unless I see a sheet
3660640	3662160	that says what I'm getting exactly
3662160	3664840	and what I have to pay into it to get,
3664840	3666120	you know, I'm not exactly sure
3666120	3668960	if it's something that I really wanna participate in.
3668960	3671200	But hey, if it's like the end of the GameStop cards now
3671200	3675040	where I pay $15 a year and I get discounts and whatnot,
3675040	3676480	I mean, that's kinda cool, I guess.
3676480	3677600	And I get a magazine at least.
3677600	3679400	I can thumb through it once a month.
3680400	3682740	Frisbee in our chat room says,
3682740	3686520	I am your retailer, get it?
3687960	3689800	All right, well, speaking of GameStop
3689800	3691840	or whatever store you wanna do,
3691840	3694760	there are some pre-order bonuses for ModNation Racers.
3694760	3696600	As mentioned before, ModNation Racers
3696600	3698680	is making its way out to stores in May,
3698680	3701560	and the date is May 25th, but,
3701560	3703400	and this has been done with quite a few Sony games,
3703400	3705520	if I'm not mistaken, and probably some 360 ones too
3705520	3706400	I can't think of right now,
3706400	3708840	but depending on where you pre-order it
3708840	3710480	is the bonus you're gonna get.
3710480	3713840	And the bonus has to do with the extra kart racers.
3713840	3716360	Now, if you decide to order from GameStop
3716360	3718280	you will get Kratos from God of War,
3718280	3721760	which I'm sure is gonna be a very popular one.
3721760	3723560	But you can also pre-order from Amazon
3723560	3725960	and you can get either Ratchet or Clank.
3725960	3726920	I don't know how that works,
3726920	3729600	if you pick when you use the code or what happens,
3729600	3730440	but you get Ratchet or Clank.
3730440	3731840	Maybe you get both.
3731840	3733360	Maybe you do get both, I don't know.
3733360	3736360	And then Best Buy, you get Nathan Drake from Uncharted,
3736360	3737480	which is actually pretty cool.
3737480	3739520	He looks like a me, honestly.
3739520	3741080	It looks like one of the Wii characters.
3741080	3743300	When you look at the little picture of Nathan Drake,
3743300	3745240	honestly, it looks like a little me there,
3745240	3746920	but that's what it is.
3746920	3748780	Kind of the cool, in my opinion,
3749620	3751360	I do love God of War, don't get me wrong,
3751360	3753200	but I think the Uncharted guy's the coolest.
3753200	3754680	I think I would get it from Best Buy
3754680	3756580	just to get Nathan Drake, so.
3757720	3759800	Now, I'm sure at some point
3759800	3761760	they're all gonna be microtransactions
3761760	3763160	on the Sony marketplace anyway,
3763160	3765580	but if you wanna cut that corner
3765580	3767220	you can do the pre-order there.
3767220	3772220	By the way, also, you do get some type of mystery mod package
3772620	3774100	when you pre-order the game.
3774100	3777600	You get pictures, and you get other accessories
3777600	3780480	to outfit your racer, and yep,
3780480	3783700	you don't know exactly what stuff you're getting
3783700	3784860	until you input the code.
3784860	3787740	It's kind of one of those mystery pins at Disneyland,
3787740	3789140	but that's what it is.
3789140	3791420	So, could be interesting.
3793700	3795060	Any interest in ModNation Racers?
3795060	3797080	You gonna run out and get this game, day one?
3797080	3799060	I'm not sure, I have it on order,
3799060	3801420	but I'm not sure if I'm gonna pick it up right away.
3801420	3803300	It looks neat, but I just have a feeling
3803300	3806380	it's not gonna be as good as Little Big Planet.
3806380	3808540	And that's really, they're trying to get us to think
3808540	3810400	that it's gonna be Little Big Planet,
3810400	3811900	you know, the kart racing game.
3814420	3816380	No, that's not what it's gonna be,
3816380	3818140	but it'll be pretty cool.
3818140	3820660	I have to admit, I'm kind of curious about the game
3820660	3822500	because I do really like the kart racing games.
3822500	3825460	Like, I really like, of course, you know, Mario Kart,
3825460	3827580	and I like, you know, those types of games.
3827580	3829700	But yeah, I didn't get into the beta.
3829700	3831040	I wish I would have just played the beta
3831040	3832380	to see if it was good or not.
3832380	3835380	I unfortunately got into the beta, but I never played it.
3835380	3837540	Which I can't believe I forgot to mention
3837540	3838380	during my gaming week,
3838380	3840540	because we were too busy talking about bad games.
3840540	3842940	But one game I did play this week was the blur beta.
3842940	3844720	Finally decided to give that a try
3844720	3846420	and give that a go, the blur beta.
3846420	3848720	And I had a lot of problems connecting to a race.
3848720	3849800	So when I was playing it the first time,
3849800	3851880	I could not get into a race.
3851880	3853700	But I went in, I just waited a couple hours
3853700	3855120	and went in later and it worked just fine.
3855120	3857560	And we actually played a couple races, just Alan watched.
3857560	3858580	And it was really pretty.
3858580	3859420	It was nice looking.
3859420	3860260	I thought it looked amazing.
3860260	3861620	Yeah, the graphics are really good.
3861620	3863740	And you know, I had a lot of fun
3863740	3865940	because, you know, this one random guy
3865940	3867360	and I kept targeting each other.
3867360	3869780	Like, we kept randomly passing each other and stuff.
3869780	3870620	So I had fun with blur.
3870620	3871900	I definitely want to pick up that full game
3871900	3872740	when it comes out.
3872740	3874580	Yeah, they leaked out the beta for that.
3874580	3875420	What's that?
3875420	3877280	So the beta got leaked out for that.
3877280	3878320	How's that work?
3878320	3880900	It's like a demo on a Xbox slot,
3880900	3883600	or not Xbox Live, like a Xbox marketplace.
3883600	3885760	Basically, you just copy it to your hard drive and run it.
3885760	3886340	Really?
3886340	3886840	Yeah.
3886840	3887740	They did the same thing in Halo.
3887740	3889540	Do you have to have a modded Xbox to do that, though?
3889540	3890240	I don't think so.
3890240	3891260	Really?
3891260	3892140	Interesting.
3892140	3893540	Well, I have some codes.
3893540	3895420	Maybe I'll give those away later in the show.
3895420	3896260	I don't know.
3896260	3898900	Do any chatters want a blur beta code?
3898900	3900460	I'll give some away later, if so.
3900460	3901260	We'll do that.
3901260	3901740	Why not?
3905060	3908180	SSJ100Matt says, the soundboard works great in blur.
3908180	3910540	Because, you know, he has the soundboard with the Duke Nukem
3910540	3911460	stuff and everything.
3911460	3912460	I don't know how he's doing it.
3912460	3915140	He's patching it through the 360 voice thing somehow.
3915140	3918380	And yeah, he can play all these random things he's playing.
3918380	3920260	So if anyone in chat wants a blur beta code,
3920260	3921260	I'll give some away later.
3921260	3922920	Maybe I'll give them away during Listless.
3922920	3924420	Because they sent me three others.
3924420	3926660	And I know at least, I know Alan's going to want one.
3926660	3928080	But I can give the other two away.
3928080	3929620	So I'll give those away to listeners.
3929620	3930980	Why not?
3930980	3933940	Oh, and the chat room's saying, please, sure, yay.
3933940	3936580	OK, I will give them away to random voters
3936580	3938280	in our Listless event later tonight.
3938280	3939460	So stay tuned.
3939460	3940260	Stay tuned.
3940260	3944420	OK, meanwhile, let's get into some, what, release dates?
3944420	3945700	Are we ready for release dates?
3945700	3947080	All right, let's do release dates.
3947080	3949580	All right, this week, there's some decent stuff coming out.
3949580	3951980	But let's start with some stuff that's not quite
3951980	3953240	what you may be looking for.
3953240	3956500	But hey, you've got people that you know that are kids
3956500	3957820	and stuff, right?
3957820	3960120	Zuzu Pets, yes, the crazy thing that they
3960120	3963940	were selling during the holiday that went like crazy.
3963940	3969780	Little hamsters now coming from Activision to the Nintendo DS.
3969780	3972540	In fact, you can actually snag one with a little baby hamster
3972540	3974980	that's blue and yellow.
3974980	3977420	That's one sick hamster.
3977420	3979500	How to Train Your Dragon coming out,
3979500	3980900	tying in with the new movie.
3980900	3984780	And that's going to be on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii,
3984780	3987380	DS, and I believe, PSP.
3987380	3992140	Bakugan Battle Trainer, the sequel to the marble battling
3992140	3994180	game.
3994180	3995820	That's going to be coming out to DS.
3995820	3998900	MotoGP 0910.
3998900	4000340	I guess they're kind of combining years,
4000340	4002300	because they didn't have one come out last year.
4002300	4005940	That'll be coming out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
4005940	4009740	Just Cause 2 coming out on PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360
4009740	4010540	this week.
4010540	4012700	Looks like a pretty fun game.
4012700	4016780	Red Steel 2, guaranteed to be better than the first one.
4016780	4019580	Coming out on the Wii, does require Wii Motion Plus.
4019580	4022500	So you can also pick up the Wii Motion Plus bundle
4022500	4024180	for an extra $10.
4024180	4029380	And saves you $9 off the cost of Wii Motion Plus,
4029380	4031060	if you don't have it.
4031060	4035980	My Pet Chimp coming out to Nintendo DS from 505 Games.
4035980	4039180	505 Games, I may add, was also the company
4039180	4041060	that put out that really crappy baby game
4041060	4043860	that I put on my Twitter.
4043860	4046300	They may be a good candidate to hit up for the president cat.
4046300	4047740	Yes, I retweeted that.
4047740	4050180	What the hell was that?
4050180	4052880	It's an actual baby doll thing or something, right?
4052880	4054420	That's the special edition, yes.
4054420	4058260	You can buy it with a, it's basically a,
4058260	4060740	it comes with a holster for your Wii
4060740	4062420	that you attach to any baby doll.
4062420	4063620	But this one does come with a baby doll.
4063620	4065000	It looks like an umbilical cord.
4065000	4067480	And you play these little mini games,
4067480	4070620	like feeding the baby and whatnot.
4070620	4072460	It's just funny though, because the baby doll
4072460	4074860	that comes with the little special edition
4074860	4076260	has a lazy eye.
4076260	4079060	So it looks funny.
4079060	4080420	Anyways, imagine Jim is.
4080420	4082060	What happens if you shake the baby?
4082060	4084020	Not that you should do that, that's not funny.
4084020	4084860	But what if I want to?
4084860	4086300	I don't know.
4086300	4087840	There's, I don't know if you read that,
4087840	4089180	like the actual page or whatever,
4089180	4091940	but he was tasked with putting powder on the baby
4091940	4095040	and they told him to stop, but he kept doing it anyways,
4095040	4096300	covering the baby in powder.
4096300	4097140	That's funny.
4097140	4098140	I think if you tried to play WarioWare
4098140	4100820	with the baby peripheral, that might be a lot of fun.
4100820	4103060	No, what you need to do though,
4103060	4105680	is you use the baby peripheral with other games.
4105680	4106520	Like, you know.
4106520	4107340	Yeah, that's what he's saying.
4107340	4109540	Play WarioWare with the baby peripheral.
4109540	4111620	Aim the A button.
4111620	4114180	I feel like Wii Sports, like baseball
4114180	4115760	or something like that.
4115760	4117020	You're bad.
4117020	4118900	That would be awesome.
4118900	4119900	Now there's a YouTube.
4119900	4121220	Now we need to find the baby game
4121220	4123420	just to do that for YouTube.
4123420	4124860	And G. Ditz in our chat room
4124860	4126820	makes the mandatory South Park reference.
4126820	4129820	South Park reference, sorry, I'm eating too.
4129820	4131080	Kick the baby, boop.
4132220	4135500	Cabela's Monster Bunk, or Monster Bunk?
4135500	4137120	Yes, it's a giant bunk bed.
4137120	4139620	No, Monster Buck Hunter,
4139620	4141520	because it's a deer hunting game,
4141520	4142780	comes with a gun.
4142780	4145380	Oh yeah, perfect for the redneck, can ya?
4146420	4148940	Rooms, the first building,
4148940	4153680	coming out from Konami on the Wii and DS.
4153680	4156060	Shimagami Tensei, Strange Journey,
4156060	4158460	coming out on DS as well.
4158460	4162860	Disney's Stitch Jam, kind of a music platformer game,
4162860	4164760	coming out also on the DS.
4164760	4168160	Settler 7, Paths to a Kingdom,
4168160	4170640	coming out on PC from Ubisoft.
4170640	4173060	Yes, with really crappy DRM.
4173940	4175340	Hoop, or was it,
4175340	4178300	Hall of Fame Ultimate Hoops Challenge.
4178300	4180260	It's a generic basketball game
4180260	4183060	trying to cash in on the NBA Jam franchise,
4183060	4185340	and it looks like crap.
4185340	4186180	That was quick,
4186180	4187700	because NBA Jam was just announced
4187700	4188900	a couple months ago, wasn't it?
4188900	4191220	Well, this game's been around for a while.
4191220	4193100	They were just trying to put out a basketball game
4193100	4196940	with Larry Bird in it, it's interesting.
4196940	4200180	And let's see, this is an accessory though,
4200180	4203740	but the Nyko Wand, they're gonna be doing the action pack.
4203740	4206020	You remember the Nyko Wand's like the third party controller
4206020	4209360	that actually, you can kind of move the buttons on it.
4209360	4212100	So you can plug it in with this gun attachment,
4212100	4214260	it actually has a physical button for the trigger
4214260	4217020	instead of a trigger that pushes the B button
4217020	4218340	on the bottom of the gun.
4218340	4220740	And then coming out a week from now,
4220740	4222960	America's Test Kitchen, Let's Get Cooking,
4222960	4223960	coming from Nintendo.
4223960	4225300	Let's be honest here, folks,
4225300	4227140	this is really just them repackaging
4227140	4229180	that stupid learn to cook game
4229180	4231720	that they put out a couple years ago.
4231720	4234980	It looks exactly the same, I don't know.
4234980	4236940	And then the better game of the two,
4236940	4241660	WarioWare DIY will be coming out on Sunday.
4241660	4244420	And to go with those,
4244420	4248520	the Nintendo DSi XL in Bronz and Burgundy.
4249700	4251800	Perfect for your Pokemon adventures
4251800	4253620	and your little Pokeball walking trainer.
4253620	4259380	They should really just call it Bronz and Ron Burgundy.
4259380	4260980	Oh boy.
4260980	4263480	Oh, how did I, oh wait, no never mind.
4263480	4266540	That comes out next week, or the week after next.
4266540	4267940	All right, what, what does?
4267940	4270100	Oh, free running, that's kind of neat.
4270100	4271160	What is free running?
4271160	4273040	Like parkour, like Mirror's Edge.
4273040	4274220	Oh, okay, that's kind of cool.
4274220	4275740	Except not as cool.
4275740	4278440	All right, let me get into some Japanese release dates
4278440	4279620	and tell you what's coming overseas
4279620	4282360	on the Xbox 360 on March 25th.
4282360	4284960	Chaos Head Love Choo Choo comes out.
4284960	4285980	Yes, that's the name of the game.
4285980	4287660	I'm trying to figure out what the hell this is.
4287660	4289960	It looks like a dating sim or something, I don't know.
4289960	4291880	Every time I just see these anime girls
4291880	4294460	and a bunch of text, I assume it's a dating sim.
4294460	4296860	So that's what I'm gonna call this game.
4296860	4298780	Another game coming out that does not look
4298780	4302820	like a dating sim is Hokuto Musou comes out.
4302820	4306940	And this is a punch and kick type of game.
4306940	4308980	I don't know if they have this out in America.
4308980	4312340	I'm trying to think if there's a localized version of it.
4312340	4313700	I don't know, for some reason it looks very
4313700	4315860	like Fist of the North Star-ish to me.
4315860	4317540	It's something Warriors.
4317540	4318380	It might, is it Dynasty?
4318380	4321260	Well, wait a second, what's it, what is it?
4321260	4322780	Oh, it's yeah, it's the Fist of the North Star
4322780	4324260	Dynasty Warriors game.
4324260	4325260	Oh, yeah.
4325260	4328260	Gomi, I actually identified that, woo hoo.
4328260	4330260	And let's see, what else is coming out
4330260	4335260	on the PlayStation 3, the God of War trilogy,
4335420	4338120	as well as God of War 3 makes its way out to Japan as well.
4338120	4340860	So they get their versions not that long after we did.
4340860	4343940	And Hokuto Musou also comes out over there.
4343940	4348620	They also get Pachipata 15, Super Umi Monogatari
4348620	4351140	in Okinawa 2 comes out as well.
4351140	4352060	Rawr, rawr.
4354000	4355580	Comes out over there from Irem.
4355580	4357260	And it's a gambling game.
4357260	4359340	I guess it's some type of, I don't know if that's
4359340	4361840	like pachinko games or what the hell else it is there.
4361840	4363860	So there's that.
4363860	4365960	That is out on the PlayStation 3.
4365960	4369300	And on the Nintendo Wii, Silent Hill Shattered Memories
4369300	4370840	gets its release in Japan.
4370840	4373460	So if you wanna run and open doors and stuff,
4373460	4374960	that is coming out on the Nintendo Wii.
4374960	4378100	It's also coming out on the PlayStation 2.
4378100	4381680	The Nintendo DS gets a variety of different games this week,
4381680	4385020	like some type of phonics game and a wrestling game,
4385020	4387400	but nothing that really big that's worth talking about,
4387400	4388240	to be honest.
4388240	4392740	But the Sony PSP gets Burst Error, Eve the First.
4392740	4394540	And I don't know what that game is.
4394540	4398420	So that looks like a little, I guess,
4398420	4400380	oh, it's a sequel to a PC game
4400380	4402080	from the mid-90s, Burst Error.
4402080	4403380	That's what this is.
4403380	4405980	And they've turned it into Chicks with Guns
4405980	4407560	and Abnormally Large Boobies.
4407560	4409400	There you go, look at that screenshot right there.
4409400	4411240	Big, big boobies.
4411240	4414680	And also coming out on the Sony PSP,
4414680	4417600	Prinny 2, Tokuyugi Akasuki No Pants.
4419780	4422040	That's right, No Pants is in the title.
4422040	4423820	Daisaku Ensi, and I'm pretty sure
4423820	4426240	that's I Wanna Be the King Part 2.
4426240	4427580	Yes, it is.
4427580	4429760	Prinny 2 comes out this week.
4429760	4430980	Very nice.
4430980	4433340	Well, joining us in studio just in time,
4433340	4436580	say hello to Dark Sakura, or you're muted.
4436580	4437580	Now you can, now you can roar.
4437580	4439540	What the heck you mute me for?
4439540	4441460	Well, cause I didn't want the mic picking up sound
4441460	4442300	when you weren't here.
4442300	4443820	I didn't want Shermie to jump up on your chair
4443820	4445860	and go, meow, roar.
4445860	4449980	Shermie is too freaking fat to jump up.
4449980	4453980	And by the way, I'm still burning from the horseradish.
4453980	4455980	I attended my first Seder tonight.
4455980	4457220	Oh, did you have fun?
4457220	4458060	It was a lot of fun.
4458060	4459220	It was all chicks.
4459220	4460380	It was a woman's Seder.
4460380	4460900	Oh, I see.
4460900	4462540	So it was very estrogen-y.
4462540	4463380	OK.
4463380	4465140	Are you all in the same cycle now?
4465140	4466760	I don't know, but the food was good.
4466760	4467900	There was chocolate.
4467900	4469020	Well, of course, with a bunch of women,
4469020	4470720	of course there's going to be good food.
4470720	4472180	Oh, it was fantastic.
4472180	4474660	And I brought the Nada Shovets.
4474660	4475180	All right.
4475180	4477100	It was like, we didn't tell anyone to bring the wine.
4477100	4477820	Bring the wine.
4477820	4478420	OK.
4478420	4480380	Do you want to do UK release dates, or?
4480380	4481140	Yeah, I can.
4481140	4482540	You want to do UK release dates?
4482540	4483180	Because we're ready.
4483180	4483860	We're ready for you.
4483860	4485540	Look, I had everything up already.
4485540	4487500	You got here just in time for your first story.
4487500	4488580	How do you like that?
4488580	4490540	Because we didn't have you slated for anything earlier,
4490540	4492580	but you got here just in time for your first story.
4492580	4495100	Did you want to talk about your gaming week real quick?
4495100	4496740	Gaming week?
4496740	4498700	I just assumed Star Trek Online and Peggle.
4498700	4499620	That's what I told the listeners.
4499620	4502140	Well, no, I didn't play Peggle at all, actually.
4502140	4503740	I did play Star Trek Online, and I
4503740	4505480	was about to start Final Fantasy II,
4505480	4509740	except I think I got a phone call, because it's on my phone.
4509740	4510660	Oh.
4510660	4511580	I got it for iPhone.
4511580	4513580	Damn those phone calls interrupting your game.
4513580	4514860	I got it for iPhone.
4514860	4522980	And then Dan was playing Gauntlet, like on the NES.
4522980	4523900	No, on the Genesis.
4523900	4524940	He was playing Genesis Gauntlet.
4524940	4525440	Awesome.
4525440	4526860	You missed it earlier in the show.
4526860	4529420	Alan and I played Double Dragon on the Xbox this week,
4529420	4531300	and we think it's the most horrible arcade
4531300	4532360	game in existence.
4532360	4534900	And one of those games just kind of sucks.
4534900	4537620	But Dan came in here and yelled at us,
4537620	4539700	because he thinks Double Dragon's awesome.
4539700	4541660	He would.
4541660	4544500	All right, UK release dates, Dark Soccer, just in time.
4544500	4545340	What week is this?
4545340	4547700	The 21st through the 27th, huh?
4547700	4553340	OK, on the 24th, Game Room, Xbox 360.
4553340	4554780	God, why do they keep changing the date?
4554780	4559280	BlazBlue Calamity Trigger, Clash of the Titans, Echo Shift.
4559280	4560620	That's actually a cool name.
4560620	4564620	Infinite Space, Just Cause 2, Pokemon Heart
4564620	4567940	Gold and Soul Silver, whatever.
4567940	4572700	Well, you know, OK, how different
4572700	4573820	can they do a Pokemon game?
4573820	4574420	Please tell me.
4574420	4576220	Because you have the walking trainer this time,
4576220	4577100	but it's a Pokeball.
4577100	4578040	I had one of those.
4578040	4578540	Yeah?
4578540	4580900	I had one of those, and that's when that's all it was.
4580900	4583700	And it was yellow, and it was in black and white.
4583700	4586540	But this one has Pokemans in it as you walk.
4586540	4587820	Mine had Pokemans in it.
4587820	4588900	That's right.
4588900	4592020	You grow your Mudkips by walking around the block.
4592020	4593420	Mine had Pokeman in it.
4593420	4595300	It had Pikachu.
4595300	4597860	So, eh.
4597860	4598700	Where am I?
4598700	4600260	I would play the MMO, though.
4600260	4603020	And there's a Racket Sports Party.
4603020	4605180	I would play the Pokemon MMO, and I
4605180	4607140	would play Pokemon Snap 2 if they ever made it.
4607140	4608340	Would you play it in a box?
4608340	4609380	Would you play it with a fox?
4609380	4612060	I would play it on a train, and I would play it in the rain.
4612060	4614420	Could you, would you, with a mouse?
4614420	4616780	Shut the fuck up and read the dates.
4616780	4624060	Resonance of Fate, Red Steel 2, Rugu Attack, Rugu Twisted
4624060	4629340	Towers, Star Wars The Force Unleashed Ultimate Sith
4629340	4634940	Edition, Die Seidler 7, Warriors Legends of Troy.
4634940	4637340	God, they're just putting everything right together.
4637340	4638700	I may as well do next week, too.
4638700	4641100	Shoot, Grand Theft Auto IV, or whatever.
4641100	4643100	But again, or is that like a price reduction?
4643100	4644020	It's a loss in the damn.
4644020	4644700	I think it's a.
4644700	4645820	Oh, gotcha.
4645820	4647700	By the way, our chat room jumping out here
4647700	4649420	and screaming some corrections here.
4649420	4650540	Llama Juice, it's not new.
4650540	4651820	It's gold and silver.
4651820	4654580	And Llama Juice says, the game is actually fun.
4654580	4656860	And Dr. Tetsuya says, you're Pokemans.
4656860	4657900	Please show us them.
4657900	4660340	Alpha Kinetagram says, gold kicked ass.
4660340	4661100	Gold kicked ass.
4661100	4663380	I thought Pearl was fun until I stopped going to the gym.
4663380	4666500	Spike McRue says, yeah, but gold and silver were the best.
4666500	4668140	Let's be honest.
4668140	4668900	No, no, no.
4668900	4670360	I have some friends that are doing.
4670360	4672260	The pinnacle is Pokemon Snap.
4672260	4674780	There's this gal on my Twitter friends list,
4674780	4676080	and I don't know her real well.
4676080	4679140	I think she runs Gaming Angels, I want to say
4679140	4680180	is the name of the site.
4680180	4681700	I hope I got that right.
4681700	4683900	And she made this tweet that I just found hilarious,
4683900	4685700	because I kind of could see myself.
4685700	4689420	She said something like, I'm in line right now waiting
4689420	4690700	to get the new Pokemon game.
4690700	4691860	Yeah, I'm 33 years old.
4691860	4692360	What?
4694860	4696560	And I'm like, oh, that must be awkward
4696560	4700460	to be in the midnight launch line for Pokemon.
4700460	4703060	My Pokemans let you not show them to me.
4703060	4704820	But I got to say, there's quite a few people
4704820	4706660	I know that are playing the new Pokemon game.
4706660	4710100	I almost, almost want to get it.
4710100	4712340	But I'm afraid if I do, Alan will break up with me.
4712340	4713380	He's like, no, I can't.
4713380	4716020	If you do, I'll disown you, Rob.
4716020	4718420	Alan, would you break up with me if I got the Pokemon game?
4718420	4718820	Would you be able to handle it?
4718820	4720160	I have nothing against Pokemon.
4720160	4720900	Really?
4720900	4722320	Do you want to play Pokemon together?
4722320	4725160	We'll both get the game and then run around the block
4725160	4726020	and evolve our Pokemon.
4726020	4729940	Rob, you're such a five-year-old girl.
4729940	4731940	I'm just kidding, I'm not going to get it.
4731940	4733180	Oh, but Spyro in chat.
4733180	4735500	Oh, and Ionotropic I should give credit to first.
4735500	4738020	A jump in and say, Pokemon pinball rules all.
4738020	4739620	Abso-fucking-lutely.
4739620	4740580	That was pretty fun.
4740580	4741820	That was an amazing game.
4741820	4742780	A++.
4742780	4743780	I will sign off on that.
4743780	4745860	It's still burning from the damn horseradish.
4745860	4747780	It's also really kind of hot in the studio right now.
4747780	4749220	Well, you know, I've got this thing
4749220	4750940	that I used to tie the curtains back with, Rob,
4750940	4752100	so you could actually have airflow.
4752100	4752460	Hi.
4752460	4753860	By the way, I was going to ask you when you got here.
4753860	4755900	Were you able to do the orange scarf, after all?
4755900	4757340	Or was that not finished?
4757340	4758900	All right, that's all right.
4758900	4759700	I've had no time.
4759700	4760440	No, I understand.
4760440	4761060	I understand.
4761060	4764220	I just want to, before I talk about PAX East in part B,
4764220	4765340	I want to make sure I have.
4765340	4767260	But I'll try to get this monstrosity finished.
4767260	4769980	Well, I leave on Tuesday night.
4769980	4771740	So I'm good.
4771740	4772420	Oh, all right.
4772420	4772940	Oh, no.
4772940	4774380	I don't think I can get it done.
4774380	4775420	I'll ship it to you.
4775420	4776420	All right.
4776420	4780060	Anyhow, let's move on with some more crash, bang, boom.
4780060	4781820	There's chaos going on in the studio.
4781820	4783340	Let's get back to some gaming news.
4783340	4785300	We have a couple more stories than the classic Game
4785300	4786700	of the Week, Loki.
4786700	4791460	Yeah, so with Game Room coming out very soon, actually,
4791460	4793580	it's interesting to find out that there's actually
4793580	4796660	going to be some achievements tied in with Game Room.
4796660	4798160	I thought that they were just going
4798160	4802700	to be tied in with actual games, but apparently it's Game Room.
4802700	4805500	There's going to be 1,000 achievement points to be had
4805500	4808620	and 56 achievements altogether.
4808620	4813380	Apparently, you get points every three medals that you earn.
4813380	4814820	There's even some points, I guess,
4814820	4818540	for spending time in the arcade, 36 hours total.
4818540	4823020	So interesting that they have that.
4825740	4826400	I don't know.
4826400	4828700	What do you think about achievements in Game Room?
4828700	4832540	Well, it's cool that they are doing more than just the 200.
4832540	4834180	I think a lot of people are bummed
4834180	4837300	that they're not doing achievement points per game,
4837300	4838980	but I think that would be a bit much.
4838980	4841620	Like, to do so many achievement points per game,
4841620	4842860	I think it would be too much.
4842860	4844860	Especially with my whole rock band analogy,
4844860	4846220	the game is Game Room.
4846220	4848180	It's just the classic games are the songs.
4848180	4850340	You know, they're the microtransactions.
4850340	4852100	It does seem like, though, if you actually
4852100	4854220	read through the list of achievements, most of them
4854220	4857220	are driven by the medals that you win
4857220	4858720	from playing the classic games.
4858720	4860220	So you're still going to have to have
4860220	4861600	a variety of classic games in order
4861600	4862760	to get all the achievements.
4862760	4865060	But I think it's pretty cool that they allowed
4865060	4866620	them to bump it up to 1,000.
4866620	4869620	I mean, you're looking at a full game.
4869620	4871500	Honestly, it's just kind of a different type
4871500	4873180	of method of getting it out there.
4873180	4873740	Definitely.
4873740	4875360	And some of the achievements in there,
4875360	4876740	they have choose for themes.
4876740	4878340	Like, place the theme in your arcade.
4878340	4882340	They have one for placing five unique themes in your arcade.
4882340	4883740	You know, theme your entire arcade
4883740	4887340	with unique themes, your mascot, props, visitors.
4887340	4891240	It seems like some of those are really easy achievements,
4891240	4893900	unless you have to do something to earn those decorations.
4893900	4895540	Well, the decorations, the thing that
4895540	4898620	worries me about the decorations is you have to buy those.
4898620	4900780	Well, didn't they say that some you would get for buying
4900780	4904500	game on release day baby but still it's
4904500	4908820	buying something you know to me I do my
4908820	4913280	buying achievement points hmm in a way
4913280	4916340	you are if you don't buy any games for
4916340	4918740	game room you can't get those metal
4918740	4920460	based achievements all I take it back
4920460	4922780	you could do it using the quarter method
4922780	4924140	but you're going to have to spend money
4924140	4926500	money one way or the other I'll check it
4926500	4931500	out it'll be interesting to see I don't
4931500	4932540	know how much I'm not really gonna play
4932540	4934560	of it though I'm not gonna lie I'm super
4934560	4936040	excited about game room I'm all about
4936040	4938260	the classic games but remember I do have
4938260	4940460	a couple rules my number one rule is I
4940460	4942420	will not buy a game that they've already
4942420	4944560	released on Xbox live arcade so don't be
4944560	4946460	looking for me and scramble or tempest
4946460	4948460	because I already have those games I'm
4948460	4950120	not buying them again and getting game
4950120	4952220	room I don't care how pretty it is
4952220	4955100	anyhow one more story for you guys
4955100	4957020	before we get to the classic game of the
4957020	4958340	week and this has to do with something I
4958340	4959460	actually mentioned during the release
4959460	4961060	dates a couple weeks ago actually I
4961060	4962460	think it was last week on the
4962460	4964420	PlayStation 3 this week they released in
4964420	4966740	Japan something called torn well guess
4966740	4969460	what apparently Famitsu is reporting
4969460	4971700	that shops in Japan are selling out of
4971700	4973420	this the standalone version of the torn
4973420	4976740	DVR peripheral although I guess the
4976740	4978500	PlayStation threes that have it built in
4978500	4980020	there's still some of those available on
4980020	4981460	shelves but this thing is selling like
4981460	4983860	crazy now what is torn it's basically a
4983860	4986980	DVR it's a DVR attachment imagine like
4986980	4988580	they sold TiVo that you would attach to
4988580	4990460	your PlayStation 3 that's what torn is
4990460	4992980	it's a DVR attachment for your ps3 and
4992980	4995440	apparently it's selling out just so you
4995440	4997300	know don't bother importing it it will
4997300	4999380	not work in America it's only capable of
4999380	5001300	doing the Japanese terrestrial yes it's
5001300	5005040	on the same system but the problem is is
5005040	5006940	that I guess torn also downloads a lot
5006940	5008540	of programming information and it's not
5008540	5009620	going to do that for the American
5009620	5012060	channels you know don't bother importing
5012060	5014180	that but think about how cool it would
5014180	5015420	be if they would just release that
5015420	5017260	frickin thing over here imagine it
5017260	5019300	imagine if they release TiVo for your
5019300	5021020	PlayStation 3 would you buy it I would
5021020	5023700	absolutely I don't have DVR on Comcast
5023700	5025260	because I don't think the DVR that
5025260	5027260	Comcast offers is that great to be to be
5027260	5029060	honest I like how TiVo will do the
5029060	5030500	recommended shows and all that stuff too
5030500	5035100	and the the DVR on Comcast is kind of
5035100	5036940	clunky for me I have something that does
5036940	5039860	that it's called um the internet and
5039860	5042100	downloading and watch it yeah I know I
5042100	5044620	know and now you know I'm ready I'm
5044620	5046020	actually ready to cancel our cable and
5046020	5047180	get a different internet provider because
5047180	5048860	I will dance on them to watch this TV
5048860	5050260	but we hooked up a computer in the front
5050260	5054780	room and watch Hulu I have a decent rate
5054780	5056940	going on right now I have a special but
5056940	5058860	I seriously think when the six months is
5058860	5060820	over I'm gonna just cancel the TV I
5060820	5062940	don't ever watch it like he watched
5062940	5065340	Casino Royale today for like a couple
5065340	5066580	minutes while I was getting ready for
5066580	5067900	the show tonight that's like the most
5067900	5070700	TV we've watched at all we do nothing
5070700	5072380	but watch Hulu now I watch drag race
5072380	5074380	online that's the only show I watch or
5074380	5076860	we'll put in you know we'll watch a DVD
5076860	5078260	or something but really almost anything
5078260	5082100	you can just find online and network
5082100	5086180	what what's that mystique you gotta say
5086180	5087940	that on the mic okay everybody say hi to
5087940	5090220	mystique but there's transform me that's
5090220	5095380	also with RuPaul's Drag Race I haven't
5095380	5096940	watched transform me but I have seen
5096940	5101100	untucked you guys see untucked what is
5101100	5102980	is that where they undo plastic surgery
5102980	5104780	or something no no untucked is like the
5104780	5106500	behind the scenes at RuPaul's Drag Race
5106500	5109940	and you can really see who is who is
5109940	5111760	nice and who is naughty and did you know
5111760	5113220	one of the one of my favorite drag
5113220	5123460	queens this season was mystique and a
5123460	5128100	porn star how many people can say they
5128100	5130180	have a name in common with a porn star
5130180	5133220	and a drag queen and a car I'm changing
5133220	5134940	my name to Pandora box that's it that's
5134940	5138380	that's what I'm gonna have to do so
5138380	5144060	moving forward bet you didn't know you
5144060	5145620	subscribe to this show and iTunes you
5145620	5147620	begin drag queen chat everyone just
5147620	5149220	wait until I put up the pictures of
5149220	5151500	Robin Frank gear I'm telling you I'm
5151500	5153660	telling you if they made you look good
5153660	5156300	in in a corset and lingerie maybe
5156300	5158060	they'll find out at PAX East but here
5158060	5160380	here's the thing seriously if they can
5160380	5162340	do a project runway video game on the
5162340	5164860	Wii why can't they do a RuPaul's Drag
5164860	5167300	Race video game on the way why not that
5167300	5169820	would be amazing because you would have

5231620	5234060	I think any Pokemon based off of mystique

5260740	5264260	right now respect those old games yeah
5264260	5266000	bitches all right what game did you pick
5266000	5268540	for us this week sword of the berserk
5268540	5271880	guts rage for dreamcast I have never
5271880	5274160	heard of this game can I be honest this
5274160	5276440	because you're lame tell tell us a
5276440	5277860	little bit about this game that guy has
5277860	5283160	a large sword why thank you um this was
5283160	5284860	a game actually in Japan is called
5284860	5287460	berserk Millennium Falcon hen was so
5287460	5289460	they've been on the show which is based
5289460	5291980	on find a great tree in this village
5291980	5294940	actually here no but I've seen a nice
5294940	5297100	bush but you should hear the voice
5297100	5299060	actor for gots you in this was Michael
5299060	5301220	all these are more likely than we are
5301220	5304780	Voltron strange so it's all the fault of
5304780	5306580	these things huh the English dub which
5306580	5314660	is stop it's a manager I love the
5314660	5316540	American voice acting though because you
5316540	5317820	know who they got to do Costco's voice
5317820	5320420	was BJ Ward who was Princess Allura huh
5320420	5323940	I was like these are voices I did I know
5323940	5325580	from my youth so this game was like
5325580	5327500	that's so cool and also my favorite
5327500	5329300	Japanese voice actor was gots his voice
5329300	5330700	in Japanese version is this like a
5330700	5333780	Silent Hill kind of game no okay I let
5333780	5335380	me let me get back to you all right
5335380	5339540	please please berserk is a dark fantasy
5339540	5344660	manga in Japan it's very graphic very
5344660	5351380	graphic very violent it's cuts mistakes
5351380	5352700	back here giving comments like look at
5352700	5354700	the size of that sword it's a nice sword
5354700	5358220	but the game is sort of an adventure RPG
5358220	5359940	hack and slash type of thing it's really
5359940	5362420	a big hack and slash it's see how much
5362420	5364140	blood you can splatter and how angry you
5364140	5367420	can make gots you so anyway it's based
5367420	5371540	off of a manga and it's set for anyone
5371540	5373900	who is a fan of berserk I've read a
5373900	5375660	whole bunch of the manga it's set
5375660	5378080	between volume 22 and 23 of the manga
5378080	5381300	it's set after the anime series the
5381300	5385220	anime is I think a 26 episode series and
5385220	5388340	it did my the anime followed the first
5388340	5389780	arc of the manga which was the whole
5389780	5392780	Taka no Dan thing everybody in chat by
5392780	5394020	the way is saying dark is an
5394020	5395820	understatement dark is totally an
5395820	5401020	understatement it's like it makes
5401020	5403300	Tarantino movies look like Cartoon
5403300	5404900	Network there's like this whole scene in
5404900	5406460	the manga where they go into this cave
5406460	5408900	and there is like an orgy of the
5408900	5411940	thousands no a graphic orgy of the
5411940	5414580	thousands cool blood orgy oh and then
5414580	5415740	when they get to the place where they're
5415740	5417220	doing the ink with the Inquisition and
5417220	5418540	we're talking about old school torture
5418540	5421260	devices pretty visit a Spanish
5421260	5424980	Inquisition it makes a Spanish it makes
5424980	5426300	the Spanish Inquisition look like a
5426300	5430020	puppet show missy's back there good
5430020	5432380	nobody expects a Spanish Inquisition
5432380	5435360	what in the hell did where where did my
5435360	5437660	show go has anyone seen it is it under
5437660	5439340	the chair that's because misty walked
5439340	5441660	into the room and she derails everything
5441660	5444140	but this particular one was on the dream
5444140	5445820	cast there's another one that came out
5445820	5447700	on ps2 but I don't count it because
5447700	5449980	really I like the Japanese one well the
5449980	5452420	the dreamcast one I do have the Japanese
5452420	5454820	version of this game and I got it just
5454820	5457260	for the voice acting because they got
5457260	5460660	the same people you know they got the
5460660	5463540	same people from the anime like a high
5463540	5465340	as she knows what she does got his voice
5465340	5467340	and same everybody except of course all
5467340	5468700	the ones who died violently at the end
5468700	5472740	of the series everybody asked that yeah
5472740	5474540	shall ran in our chat room says everyone
5474540	5476340	dies the world ends and people burn in
5476340	5478140	hell forever is a happy ending compared
5478140	5482380	to desert yeah okay okay here's here I'm
5482380	5483620	going to give the background and if you
5483620	5486980	haven't seen the anime spoiler turn off
5486980	5489060	your station for a little bit or fast
5489060	5491740	forward or whatever the whole thing
5491740	5494100	starts off with God says a boy and he
5494100	5495860	goes off and joins a mercenary group and
5495860	5497820	he meets this chick named Casca who is
5497820	5499540	the second-in-command under this guy
5499540	5501260	named Griffith who is totally pretty and
5501260	5504220	has this weird egg that he wears it has
5504220	5506460	two eyes and those in the mouth but all
5506460	5508020	spread in different areas anyway stuff
5508020	5510180	goes on Griffith turns out to be on the
5510180	5513220	next in line to be well an evil God and
5513220	5517060	sacrifices the entire group in this big
5517060	5522460	bloody feast and yay blood feast and it's
5522460	5525220	I'm not gonna go into it but as the
5525220	5527100	manga starts continuing from there got
5527100	5529340	some Casca have a mark on them that means
5529340	5530380	they're followed by demons because they
5530380	5531500	were tend to be part of the sacrifice
5531500	5533620	but they escaped there are similarities
5533620	5535300	between that and Final Fantasy 13 I just
5535300	5538860	want to know no I know there's nothing
5538860	5542140	nothing which is a bummer because I wish
5542140	5544060	vanille was in the game Jamie's talking
5544060	5547060	about that's that's the only bummer yes
5547060	5550180	you can finish so anyway um so this is
5550180	5552820	this is a side story but it from what I
5552820	5554420	understand it is considered part of part
5554420	5560020	of the cannon and so got to somewhere in
5560020	5562620	the manga got this little elf starts
5562620	5563860	following got to around called puck
5563860	5565780	who's really more like a weird little
5565780	5568780	chubby fairy with blue hair but anyway
5568780	5572740	and what you call me a blue chubby fairy
5572740	5576980	anyway anyway and the whole point is
5576980	5579420	that Casca from her ordeal because she
5579420	5582900	had a bad time has no memory she acts
5582900	5584100	like a little child she giggles she
5584100	5586300	doesn't talk she's just clueless about
5586300	5587900	the world around her and so it got to
5587900	5589300	trying to take her to the home of the
5589300	5590460	elves to get her brain cured or
5590460	5593820	something and so he hears about the
5593820	5596820	Mandragora which for anyone who knows
5596820	5598460	what what the legend of the Mandrake
5598460	5599900	route is you know you pick it's like in
5599900	5601060	Harry Potter Rob you pick him up the
5601060	5603140	screen as a grown-up one will make your
5603140	5606060	head explode or some shit anyway so
5606060	5609220	sounds like fun so anyway it's you know
5609220	5610860	them getting all caught up in this one
5610860	5613780	thing because the main bad guy his wife
5613780	5615540	has the same problem Casca does but it's
5615540	5618020	long story I'm not getting onto it this
5618020	5619820	is really a game worth playing really is
5619820	5622740	a game worth playing it's really fun so
5622740	5626700	of course it it it ends gruesome just
5626700	5628380	like anything related to berserk ends
5628380	5634260	and but it's just really really a fun
5634260	5641140	game and like I said there was a another
5641140	5643060	version that came out on PlayStation 2
5643060	5647940	there's also the soundtrack now what's
5647940	5651060	really cool about this is
5657540	5660060	horses was the opening theme song to the
5660060	5661860	anime and the guy who did the soundtrack
5661860	5663980	for the anime and the opening theme and
5663980	5668260	everything did did all the music in the
5668260	5670620	game and he did a special version of the
5670620	5673260	opening song
5679500	5681740	she did a special version of the of the
5681740	5685500	opening so it really this is actually I
5685500	5687820	think one of the best tie-ins because
5687820	5689580	you don't really have to me if you've
5689580	5690540	been keeping up with the series you
5690540	5692220	don't really have to guess about where
5692220	5705740	it's gone where the specific
5705740	5709780	this is actually one of my favorite
5709780	5719140	pieces of music ever what what everybody
5719140	5720540	from the living room keeps coming in
5720540	5722260	here to derail the show Dan is just
5722260	5724980	waving and tell everybody around tell
5724980	5727060	everyone how awesome this game is he
5727060	5730980	left he left yet chicken but head dessert
5730980	5737700	chicken I'm disowning you Peter would
5737700	5739220	tell you that what happens to chickens
5739220	5743020	is something like this dessert game yeah
5743020	5747140	but at any rate oh here you next time
5747140	5748660	you have a chicken McNugget you always
5748660	5750020	gets mad at me because I go to the
5750020	5756660	startup by lunch meet what the fuck
5756660	5760460	bitch you are eating that chicken or I'll
5760460	5767780	give it to Eric Joker yes dessert hello
5767780	5770340	we do a show here it's about on the one
5770340	5771740	that was on Dreamcast yes dessert
5771740	5775900	sucking was hard as nails it was like
5775900	5777500	you get to know throughout his odd and
5777500	5779980	he's like by the way I know you thought
5779980	5782100	you were good at 3d action games but you
5782100	5784740	saw and he'll kill you and kill you and
5784740	5786860	kill you and kill you until you finally
5786860	5788860	man up enough to beat them the rest of
5788860	5792740	the game is fucking harder than hell yes
5792740	5795900	and the story is a little bit dark no
5795900	5799100	no berserk saw bright Mary it's very
5799100	5801420	similar to the story of rape and
5801420	5805340	insanity and that's just the back story
5805340	5807060	they had called the game rape and
5807060	5808820	insanity it would have sold more but
5808820	5810340	berserk everybody thinks that's a game
5810340	5812460	with a bouncing happy face no electric
5812460	5815060	maze it's spelled differently that's
5815060	5817180	spelled with a Z okay it has a lot of
5817180	5822860	also hard as nails anything else chicken
5822860	5825460	check it
5826460	5828580	Dan was actually right that's pretty
5828580	5833180	much how the series ends I have a laser
5833180	5836340	disk now I like to berserk so that's
5836340	5840220	very cool you have your mr. J anyway
5840220	5843820	berserk was a series that I was so into
5843820	5850660	I loved the anime piss off and give me
5850660	5852780	I apologize to listeners there's just
5852780	5854460	insanity going on in the studio tonight
5854460	5857700	it's like it it's like our show has the
5857700	5859180	red ring of death tonight because it's
5859180	5862020	the 360 s episode so congratulations
5862020	5865980	Dan you broke the show tonight five
5865980	5869220	gamerscore all right yeah well I got
5869220	5872340	your chicken right here
5872340	5875700	there goes no it's in the fridge anyway
5875700	5878980	yeah when Dan says that the back story
5878980	5881540	for for this game is rape and insanity
5881540	5884780	he means that literally seriously that's
5884780	5886820	how did the TV series ends that's why
5886820	5891540	Costco's fucked up so um it's it was a
5891540	5894300	really you know what I have to say I was
5894300	5896380	surprised that the game came over here
5896380	5898820	because the anime hadn't been out over
5898820	5900140	here they didn't turn the blood into
5900140	5902100	sweat or anything no no it was vicious
5902100	5904900	but they brought the game out over here
5904900	5906900	and didn't really give any real back
5906900	5909180	story to it it was before the anime you
5909180	5911380	could only get it I think like in early
5911380	5914980	fan subs and the manga was all not even
5914980	5916020	that I don't even think there were many
5916020	5918900	fan translations out at the time so it
5918900	5921300	was just like berserk here you go and
5921300	5923100	I'm like dude what the hell hey I like
5923100	5926900	this and then I I watched some of the
5926900	5928260	anime and said to get the Japanese
5928260	5930060	version because I really love dudes voice
5930060	5932540	Hayashi Nobutoshi is like my favorite
5932540	5933980	voice actor ever if for anyone who
5933980	5935820	watched Fushigi Yugi he did Tatsuki's
5935820	5939820	voice acting and Bathora in Macross 7
5939820	5941540	not the singing although he's got an
5941540	5945060	amazing singing voice but that's those
5945060	5949100	examples oh and he also was um who was
5949100	5950300	the dude in Pokemon who had the earth
5950300	5954700	based Brock yeah whatever his name was
5954700	5958980	in Japanese okay him hmm no I think that
5958980	5960460	back the guy who did sauna's voice was
5960460	5964580	him it's an asana skate in um we run a
5964580	5966060	kitchen anyway I'm getting my voice
5966060	5969820	actors mixed up sorry but yeah I'm sorry
5969820	5971780	I'm wired you gave me chocolate I'm
5971780	5973500	like it's okay I'm just a this classic
5973500	5974380	even though we say miss we're going on
5974380	5976740	for 20 minutes is there anything about
5976740	5979900	the play the damn game and then or she
5979900	5981940	will talk more about it but I I do
5981940	5983860	weren't I do warn you if you have any
5983860	5986020	kind of traumatic memories never read
5986020	5988180	the manga I will say there's though
5988180	5990740	there's some comments from chat I own a
5990740	5992220	tropic earlier said this game is

6225740	6229260	slash olr okay now we're ready for some
6229260	6231260	news Loki let's do some rapid quick
6231260	6233660	quick news yes so let's start off with
6233660	6236980	the release date for crackdown 2 which
6236980	6239180	is now being put into one of the most
6239180	6242380	dead months of the year July yes it'll
6242380	6244900	be coming out July 6 and boy does it
6244900	6247780	look awesome the game will be releasing
6247780	6249540	in North America on July 6 with Asia
6249540	6251380	Australia and New Zealand following on
6251380	6254300	July 8th in Europe following on July 9th
6254300	6256940	no word on exactly when Japan will be
6256940	6258940	receiving the game or any of the Asian
6258940	6262340	regions but yeah it looks all sorts of
6262340	6265780	awesome one thing that was supposed to
6265780	6267620	not be coming out over here apparently
6267620	6269940	is Batman Arkham Asylum the game of the
6269940	6271380	year edition will indeed be coming out
6271380	6273220	over in North America and will also
6273220	6277460	feature 3d support as well originally
6277460	6281380	they announced that the 3d would be done
6281380	6283300	in a way that wouldn't alter the colors
6283300	6284780	however I see now in the picture that
6284780	6287340	they have the kind of purple and green
6287340	6290020	glasses so apparently it's just going to
6290020	6292700	be the standard 3d stuff but they'll be
6292700	6296620	coming out in the early part of May and
6296620	6299020	then finally to coincide with the
6299020	6301220	Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker launch
6301220	6302980	they're going to be doing a brand new
6302980	6306100	PSP bundle it's going to be coming out
6306100	6309820	on June 8th and it'll be a greenish PSP
6309820	6312380	come with a copy of the game a two
6312380	6315300	gigabyte memory sick pro duo and a
6315300	6318460	voucher for some unidentified movie
6318460	6320940	download as well as an exclusive in-game
6320940	6323220	item for Peace Walker could it possibly
6323220	6325220	be Metal Gear espionage related the
6325220	6328260	movie just call it a hunch I don't know
6328260	6329980	yes I don't know they don't have a
6329980	6331820	Metal Gear movie well you know something
6331820	6333300	there could be an anime or something
6333300	6334340	right now I guess there isn't one is
6334340	6336700	there I don't like James Bond it'll be
6336700	6338340	quantum solace or something you know
6338340	6341500	something close maybe um and that of
6341500	6345180	course will be coming out for $200 um
6345180	6347660	some news I have for you guys final
6347660	6350540	fight double impact I hoping I'm really
6350540	6352780	really hoping this is also not one of
6352780	6354100	those games that I see through road
6354100	6355740	color glasses like we were talking about
6355740	6357500	earlier in the show but I don't know
6357500	6358980	final fight came years after double
6358980	6360780	dragons I don't know and besides it also
6360780	6363140	has magic sword and I know magic sword
6363140	6364980	is still all the Capcom like beat-em-up
6364980	6366860	games are pretty awesome well it is
6366860	6369140	coming April 14th and 15th depending on
6369140	6371220	which story you want Xbox Live gets on
6371220	6372820	the 14th and PlayStation Store gets at
6372820	6374240	the same we just pointed at Captain
6374240	6376740	commandos not part of that no but it's
6376740	6378500	it's weird because it's final fight and
6378500	6380060	magic sword like I can't think of more
6380060	6381540	different games like yeah they're running
6381540	6382820	on the same end I know but they're still
6382820	6384620	like completely different games Loki
6384620	6386140	they're not they have nothing in common
6386140	6388260	yes the same engine that's all two games
6388260	6389500	the present one that's the way I look at
6389500	6391620	it that's fine that's fine so I'm
6391620	6392620	looking forward to it if not for nothing
6392620	6395500	else for me it's a magic sword featuring
6395500	6397900	final fight because I I hate how magic
6397900	6399340	sword is being understated in this
6399340	6401260	release like that I don't know why it
6401260	6403940	bugs me I'm just weird would you like to
6403940	6405980	buy my namesake that's right you can buy
6405980	6408940	an ROB robot the Rob the robot you can
6408940	6410860	buy for the Nintendo Entertainment
6410860	6412340	System except it will set you back only
6412340	6413860	four thousand one hundred and fifty
6413860	6415700	dollars that's right it just sold on an
6415700	6417380	ebay auction this week but here's the
6417380	6419340	deal guys it was like pristine in a case
6419340	6420620	it looks like one of those sales cases
6420620	6422300	that it was you have in the store I
6422300	6423980	remember those yeah I remember those two
6423980	6425460	so somebody actually bought that with
6425460	6426840	the Nintendo system the controllers the
6426840	6429500	gun all that stuff four thousand one
6429500	6430700	hundred fifty dollars I don't know if
6430700	6433020	they remembered but it wasn't that good
6433020	6434420	like I don't know if you ever actually
6434420	6436220	played the Rob the robot but it was kind
6436220	6437840	of annoying wanted to get one for my
6437840	6439820	desk and trust me they're a lot cheaper
6439820	6441860	than four grand I mean you could get them
6441860	6443840	well yeah but these are in pristine
6443840	6446300	condition who cares and then the control
6446300	6447620	I gotta say in the display box and
6447620	6449220	everything's pretty cool but it's weird
6449220	6451880	to think that that was sitting in some
6451880	6453820	store that probably got sent it for free
6453820	6455780	but yeah if you never played the Rob the
6455780	6457460	robot before it was really weird it had
6457460	6459440	these little gyro things that would spin
6459440	6461580	and then you would have to move them on
6461580	6464060	to a thing that would push down the
6464060	6466020	button on your controller but then they
6466020	6467500	would start to lose speed so you have to
6467500	6468820	pick them up and rev them up again like
6468820	6471460	it was kind of annoying yeah um the nest
6471460	6473960	that I got was I think I got a nest when
6473960	6475180	I was little within the first month of
6475180	6478260	it coming out so I got the Rob system it
6478260	6480100	really wasn't fun at all and it was loud
6480100	6483100	it was so loud the sound of it you know
6483100	6485080	spinning up the things my friend had one
6485080	6486260	of these and I remember we tried to play
6486260	6487700	it once it was a little ridiculous yeah
6487700	6492300	yeah so not worth forty one fifty okay
6492300	6494380	all right and one other story for you
6494380	6496540	guys pac-man battle royale we talked
6496540	6497780	about a couple weeks on the show saying
6497780	6499140	it had the worst teaser trailer ever
6499140	6500460	because it didn't say anything about the
6500460	6502780	game now we finally know some things
6502780	6504900	about the game a video has it hit the
6504900	6506660	internet from the amusement expo that
6506660	6509260	finally shows a little bit about what we
6509260	6510880	can see in this game and we see some
6510880	6512460	folks playing the game in this video and
6512460	6514900	basically it looks like a little bit of
6514900	6517020	a mixture between pac-man championship
6517020	6518220	edition it kind of has those little
6518220	6520460	graphics and a little bit of pac-man
6520460	6523380	versus elements but here's the deal in
6523380	6525260	pac-man versus the other players are
6525260	6526820	playing as ghosts but that's not what's
6526820	6528900	happening here everybody is playing as
6528900	6532100	different pac-man but pac-man can eat
6532100	6534060	the other pac-man's with a specific
6534060	6536340	powerup and here's the coolest part of
6536340	6539700	all it's a cocktail cabinet so it's a
6539700	6542260	table that's the cabinet they're playing
6542260	6543460	it on it's one of those old cocktail
6543460	6544740	but you know the lamest part about it is
6544740	6546020	what you dots doesn't give you any
6546020	6547580	points there's no points in the game
6547580	6549100	other than eating the other players or
6549100	6550300	being the last one to survive I would
6550300	6552100	imagine eating the dots is how you power
6552100	6554780	up it's basically it's basically how you
6554780	6556700	eating the dots is basically how you
6556700	6558820	trigger more dots appear and more power
6558820	6560660	ups in here yeah did you grow like super
6560660	6563140	pac-man yes you do that is beautiful yeah
6563140	6565120	and it's a freaking cocktail cabinet
6565120	6567980	that's the coolest part honestly so
6567980	6569540	that's gonna look cool in some arcade
6569540	6570940	before the little kid spills their drink
6570940	6572740	on it but there you go that is what
6572740	6574300	battle royale that's gonna be my coffee
6574300	6576340	table you should get one of those
6576340	6578660	machines that's hot those machines that
6578660	6580380	would not be cheap dark soccer what do
6580380	6582220	you have for us I actually have to tell
6582220	6583700	everybody that Rob was grammatically
6583700	6585980	correct because pac-man is a proper name
6585980	6589500	therefore pac-man's would be correct
6589500	6592820	instead of pac-man now if pac-man is his
6592820	6596180	species then pac-man would be proper just
6596180	6602940	checking nope don't care I'm fine see
6602940	6610780	ya bite me no okay well for our friends

6789980	6791580	tonight by the way later on tonight in
6791580	6793980	part B our good friend Aaron also known
6793980	6795540	as why YR is going to be back because
6795540	6797260	apparently he has released a new game
6797260	6800300	tonight is it a sequel to three snake
6800300	6803860	360 no but it's still retro tastic
6803860	6805540	already awesome as if it was gorillas
6805540	6808660	360 instead of snakes yeah you will know
6808660	6811060	remember gorillas were the old basic
6811060	6813900	game that you get with dog yes yes well
6813900	6816340	you might say that this is penguins 360
6816340	6818420	so we'll talk about that in a little
6818420	6820260	while we'll go talk about that that but
6820260	6821660	it released like literally like 30
6821660	6823100	minutes ago or something like that on
6823100	6825500	the Xbox indie game so we will talk
6825500	6828220	about that in just a moment okay but
6828220	6830620	first some Twitter topics and I was not
6830620	6832900	a good host tonight and forgot to remind
6832900	6834460	people to post their Twitter topics but
6834460	6836660	that's okay like I don't want the
6836660	6837820	segment to be that long tonight so we
6837820	6839180	have listless tonight and now we have an
6839180	6841580	interview in part B so um yeah we got to
6841580	6844980	uh hurry hurry all right let's see
6844980	6848300	starting off with Tiger Claw 305 linking
6848300	6851700	us to a story about how McDonald's uses
6851700	6855180	the DS to train part-time workers it's a
6855180	6857780	DS based training now keep in mind this
6857780	6858820	isn't something that's happening in
6858820	6860260	America but it's something that's
6860260	6862540	working with McDonald's Japan they
6862540	6864420	actually use the DS as a training tool
6864420	6866420	using a training program called e smart
6866420	6868700	so a part-time employee will train
6868700	6871180	through the software it's gonna be used
6871180	6874340	in 3700 stores all around Japan and the
6874340	6876780	program's cost is about 200 million yen
6876780	6878500	not that somebody actually has to pay
6878500	6879900	that that's how much it cost to develop
6879900	6881620	and everything McDonald's thinks it can
6881620	6883900	cut the training time in half by over
6883900	6887020	half by using this new system because
6887020	6888860	lots of people already know how to use
6888860	6890580	the DS and they want to get employees
6890580	6893100	quickly out on the floor kind of
6893100	6896100	interesting I got to admit my day job if
6896100	6897380	you didn't know happens it has to do a
6897380	6899100	training I trained for a big corporation
6899100	6901700	and not McDonald's but you know a
6901700	6904340	different corporation and I'm always
6904340	6905380	interested in these types of new
6905380	6909020	training tools I guess you know if you
6909020	6910940	can make sure that employees are
6910940	6912420	comprehending the information given and
6912420	6914940	it's a fun interactive way to learn why
6914940	6917220	not at least a much easier way to get
6917220	6919020	some of the quote-unquote boring stuff
6919020	6920500	out of the way for lack of a better term
6920500	6926180	um let's see going on to blue swim
6926180	6928580	Twitter question did you guys take
6928580	6931660	advantage of Kmart's $10 off $20 plus
6931660	6933940	coupon overnight apparently there was an
6933940	6936140	online coupon for its NYC stores that
6936140	6938220	wasn't region locked allowing people
6938220	6940900	everywhere to use it no I hadn't heard
6940900	6942660	and I would be real it would be really
6942660	6944300	hard to get me to set foot in a Kmart
6944300	6946340	anyway I guess it came out around the
6946340	6948220	corner but you know free money is a
6948220	6949980	pretty good way to do it I gotta say so
6949980	6954100	oops we started to have mailbag music
6954100	6955100	play in the background there we don't
6955100	6958340	want that s to 100 Matt is linking us to
6958340	6961020	a story about an apple related incident
6961020	6963260	where Apple apparently banned a game
6963260	6965300	developer because he called the store
6965300	6968180	awful and horrible is the developers
6968180	6971780	name was Tommy reference and the Apple
6971780	6975340	removed his app zits and giggles well
6975340	6976940	for starters that just needed to be
6976940	6980460	removed but whatever apparently the
6980460	6982340	creator was that game developers
6982340	6985860	conference and he said that he absolutely
6985860	6988420	fucking hates the iPhone app store he
6988420	6990380	said that the iPhone gaming market is
6990380	6992540	like the Tigard handheld games of sorry
6992540	6994500	the tiger handheld games of the 80s and
6994500	6996460	90s you might remember those crappy
6996460	6998300	little LCD games like mr. game and watch
6998300	7002020	esque stuff also zits and giggles this
7002020	7003740	is the guy this is the company and I
7003740	7004860	think we've talked about on the store
7004860	7007100	they would keep raising the price of
7007100	7008580	their game to see who would keep buying
7008580	7010700	it and they had raised it up to over
7010700	7012980	four hundred dollars apple of course
7012980	7016060	didn't tell any reason why they took the
7016060	7019460	game down so there you go but maybe had
7019460	7020740	to be with the fact that he was acting
7020740	7023540	like a dick and if you bite the hand
7023540	7025380	that feeds you they're probably going to
7025380	7030380	cut you off I own o tropic asks puzzle
7030380	7033220	quest to discuss the puzzle crack puzzle
7033220	7035580	quest 2 is not out yet is it it's not
7035580	7037780	out yet it's coming out Alan I know
7037780	7039300	you're a big puzzle quest fan and you
7039300	7040900	like the gyromancers and those types of
7040900	7042580	games what do you want in a puzzle quest
7042580	7044020	to is there anything you're looking for
7044020	7049060	um just have it not be Galactrix really
7049060	7051300	it's not Galactrix this time no they're
7051300	7052900	going back to the old school puzzle
7052900	7055620	quest it's more yield a bejeweling yeah
7055620	7057700	so there you just want more of the same
7057700	7060620	you know no features you get to go well
7060620	7063300	they have like pickle quests or something
7063300	7065700	like that you know pickle quest I think
7065700	7068140	our soccer be all over that pick pickle
7068140	7072220	nights with a K pickle death all right
7072220	7074500	and lastly act death links us to the
7074500	7076620	story Australia is closer to getting m
7076620	7079100	rated games it says the tweet that came
7079100	7082220	to us at olr Lincoln is this story about
7082220	7084540	somebody I guess who is stepping down
7084540	7087700	Michael Atkinson is the South Australian
7087700	7090020	Attorney General and apparently he's the
7090020	7092980	reason why there is no r18 plus rating
7092980	7094940	for games he's stepping down and the
7094940	7097260	thought is maybe somebody will get in
7097260	7098340	there that knows what they're talking
7098340	7100260	about with this rating system so maybe
7100260	7101540	we won't have so many stories about
7101540	7104340	Australia gets such-and-such banned game
7104340	7106220	or what have you in the future that
7106220	7108260	would be exciting for them we'll hope at
7108260	7111060	least anyway for them all right let's
7111060	7112940	get back into some news the Loki which
7112940	7115940	got forced tonight apparently Pikmin 3
7115940	7118500	is in development and Miyamoto has
7118500	7120820	confirmed that I believe he confirmed it
7120820	7123180	before though if you ask me but whatever
7123180	7125180	apparently the official Nintendo
7125180	7128820	magazine in the UK was saying that you
7128820	7131940	know Miyamoto has confirmed that Pikmin
7131940	7134620	3 development is well underway over a
7134620	7137700	year ago it was rumored to be released
7137700	7140820	apparently around this time but it's not
7140820	7147180	obviously and no word exactly what
7147180	7148740	they're going to change about it
7148740	7152500	apparently the thought is maybe they're
7152500	7156660	going to announce something e3 I don't
7156660	7158220	know I've never really got into the
7158220	7159900	Pikmin games it's sort of like perfect
7159900	7161540	dark for me I'd never really played it
7161540	7163660	before I don't know if you think this is
7163660	7165100	a game I would enjoy or what is the
7165100	7167420	appeal of Pikmin to the masses I have no
7167420	7170180	idea to be honest I never played them
7170180	7172180	and I know when they were released the
7172180	7176100	GameCube one they only did the first
7176100	7177820	GameCube one over here too because they
7177820	7180220	had the second one come out in Japan but
7180220	7182740	that new play control series I don't
7182740	7185660	think it did very well over here and a
7185660	7187180	lot of the games didn't get released I
7187180	7188660	got released isn't that Nintendo's
7188660	7190660	lesson learned like stop supporting the
7190660	7193340	same shit we already had exactly and I'm
7193340	7195660	just gonna tell you right now Pikmin 3
7195660	7196580	is probably not going to be any
7196580	7199580	different than Pikmin 2 it'll just be on
7199580	7201420	the Wii and you'll buy it anyways
7201420	7203500	because you're sucker but I don't think
7203500	7205300	this is gonna have the same draw as like
7205300	7208140	say a Mario Galaxy or something like
7208140	7211260	that and you know and not that this
7211260	7213100	would be a horrible thing I think it
7213100	7215100	would be a very cheap thing to do but I
7215100	7217580	could see Nintendo doing another new
7217580	7220380	Super Mario Brothers game this soon you
7220380	7221740	know what I mean very it's very possible
7221740	7224740	I went to the chat room and I asked in
7224740	7226900	chat at chat.ownersloudestrader.com I
7226900	7228620	said chat help me out what is the appeal
7228620	7230580	of Pikmin and G Ditz replied is there
7230580	7233220	any? Hackdeft replied Pikmin is basically
7233220	7236580	an RTS but cute so that is apparently
7236580	7240140	what it is it's an RTS but cute so there
7240140	7243420	you go and ToaGak seems to think if
7243420	7245860	Pikmin 3 does not equal 2 then 3 does
7245860	7248620	not equal 1 Frisbee says Pikmin was
7248620	7250980	great nine years ago Lama Juice says I
7250980	7252420	like Pikmin 1 I thought the game was
7252420	7255380	really fun so I don't know it's just one of those
7255380	7257580	games I never got around to playing so ToaGak
7257580	7259660	also chimes in and says I fucking hate
7259660	7262060	the new play controls. Spike McCrew says
7262060	7264620	it's got calm music. So we need a new
7264620	7267980	Star Fox or a new F-Zero that's what we
7267980	7273260	need for Pikmin so all right well I've
7273260	7274740	got another story for you guys and it
7274740	7277820	has to do with the first lady Michelle
7277820	7280500	Obama yes video games and the White
7280500	7283020	House believe it or not and apparently
7283020	7287100	it's because the government has kind of
7287100	7289900	in a way endorsed Dance Dance Revolution
7289900	7292180	okay let me explain how this works here
7292180	7294860	let's move is a new program and first
7294860	7296460	lady Michelle Obama was there for the
7296460	7298460	kickoff and she actually mentioned the
7298460	7300820	game by name in her speech she said and
7300820	7302660	I have to say that many of you have been
7302660	7304620	very creative on this piece already
7304620	7307280	folks in West Virginia have taken the
7307280	7309820	lead in bringing DDR that's Dance Dance
7309820	7311660	Revolution it's a new video game that
7311660	7314260	gets kids up and moving haha new the
7314260	7316540	game's been around since what 98 many
7316540	7318220	other states use it as well and let me
7318220	7320020	tell you I can attest to Dance Dance
7320020	7322220	Revolution we got it at Camp David and
7322220	7324020	it'll make you sweat and it's addictive
7324020	7325700	in a very good way the president still
7325700	7328960	can't do it so anyhow that's cute I want
7328960	7331460	to point out that let's move is not just
7331460	7333540	about DDR though but it's more about
7333540	7336460	getting you know kids and stuff up and
7336460	7338980	moving so it's a good thing they didn't
7338980	7342740	call the program let them move though a
7342740	7346620	big groan from the DDR crowd I would
7346620	7348380	find them I love the fact though that
7348380	7351940	it's a quote-unquote new video game well
7351940	7353900	technically that's true they're making
7353900	7356300	new video games in that series all the
7356300	7360340	time it's just it's nowhere near new so
7360340	7363100	all right dark soccer's got a story for
7363100	7366220	us and then listless is coming up well
7366220	7371860	um steam is of course removing
7371860	7374860	Assassin's Creed 2 and silent hunter 5
7374860	7377100	but it says it wasn't because of the DRM
7377100	7382500	they are actually available in places
7382500	7385420	other than steam it's just specifically
7385420	7390740	that steam UK didn't wasn't wanting to
7390740	7393020	deal with it they said that it has to do
7393020	7395140	with local business discussion between
7395140	7398180	Ubisoft and steam in the UK but yeah but
7398180	7405140	it's no longer available well I guess I
7405140	7407780	want to try to fix it well you know I
7407780	7409820	know steam is denying it and it's
7409820	7412300	probably accurate because it sounds like
7412300	7414940	this is isolated to overseas it's not
7414940	7416980	really happening here UK specific yeah
7416980	7420340	so but but I still go back to the point
7420340	7421580	I was saying before when I was talking
7421580	7423700	about how Ubisoft DRM is not just going
7423700	7426060	to get Ubisoft in trouble that they're
7426060	7428700	going to be calling places like Target
7428700	7430420	and Walmart where people buy these games
7430420	7432260	say my game doesn't work and returning
7432260	7433740	it and the retailer is going to get
7433740	7435180	caught in the middle and the minute that
7435180	7436300	starts happening they're going to stop
7436300	7438300	carrying these games so I think it's
7438300	7440180	ridiculous anything I'll ask any of this
7440180	7444380	through all right well folks it is that
7444380	7446260	time and we haven't done this in a
7446260	7447740	little while on the show but I'm very
7447740	7449100	excited that tonight we are bringing
7449100	7456580	back for a 360 episode listless okay
7456580	7458860	now there's a lot of people in our chat
7458860	7460660	room that are kind of newer to the show
7460660	7461820	and they don't know how this works so
7461820	7463820	let me explain it for you guys what we're
7463820	7464860	going to do is we're going to go around
7464860	7466700	the room and we are going to create the
7466700	7469220	definitive list about a certain topic
7469220	7471780	and tonight's topic is the great idea
7471780	7473860	that Microsoft should steal and make
7473860	7476100	better next sometimes our answers are
7476100	7477780	serious sometimes they're silly
7477780	7480060	sometimes they're completely nonsensical
7480060	7482340	but like it or not it is the list that
7482340	7484660	we have come up with for the question
7484660	7487060	now once all four of us since we have
7487060	7489300	our special guest Alan tonight come up
7489300	7491100	with our list we'll have a list of 12
7491100	7494140	then the hard part comes we will each go
7494140	7496980	around the room and remove one item from
7496980	7498660	the list usually it's someone else's
7498660	7499900	item but you can remove your own I
7499900	7501260	suppose if you are feeling cannibalistic
7501260	7503340	like that that will leave us with a list
7503340	7505940	of eight then our chat room will vote
7505940	7508180	for their number one and number two
7508180	7510460	favorite in a private message to me and
7510460	7514860	then your top three answers based on
7514860	7516420	your votes will come up with our
7516420	7520220	definitive list now keep in mind you can
7520220	7521620	send us private message now if you have
7521620	7523340	an answer if you want to help the hosts
7523340	7526180	out and because you know sometimes we
7526180	7527940	are thinking of topics right on the
7527940	7529820	right in the heat of the moment I'm
7529820	7532980	Loki you can yell out your answers in
7532980	7534540	chat right now and they might get
7534540	7537100	included in the host list so again that
7537100	7540580	is the great idea that Microsoft
7540580	7543660	Microsoft Microsoft Microsoft Microsoft
7543660	7547140	Microsoft I never met a carrot I didn't
7547140	7549740	like except for this one the great idea
7549740	7552860	that Microsoft should steal next all
7552860	7554540	right who wants to start us off tonight
7554540	7557060	Loki I'll call on you and see if you did
7557060	7559860	your homework your number three answer
7559860	7562060	for the great idea because again I want
7562060	7562980	to remind you guys where this topic
7562980	7566460	comes from project Natal stolen motion
7566460	7570820	controller basically Xbox live kind of
7570820	7572500	taking some things from PC gaming and
7572500	7575180	incorporating into their games you know
7575180	7577620	the Xbox takes other people's ideas not
7577620	7578540	that there's anything wrong with that
7578540	7580180	because they make them better they take
7580180	7581100	other people's ideas and make them
7581100	7584380	better all right so here we go what
7584380	7587180	should they improve next and I guess it
7587180	7588820	doesn't have to be gaming related but it
7588820	7590700	helps all right Loki what is your oops I
7590700	7592620	gotta get my own little whiteboard up
7592620	7594500	here to keep track of our answers Loki
7594500	7596500	what is your number three answer for the
7596500	7599060	idea that they should steal next the PSP
7599060	7602420	the PSP so making like a handheld system
7602420	7604900	essentially you're just the PSP no a
7604900	7607300	handheld system they shouldn't exactly
7607300	7609180	make it like the PSP but like you know
7609180	7611060	something that's a widescreen you know
7611060	7614420	possibly high def you know handheld
7614420	7616540	system plays decent games me ties in
7616540	7620300	with Xbox live arcade and you know Xbox
7620300	7623700	live and that kind of stuff cool so Loki
7623700	7625500	is kind of going serious for once this

7647020	7649300	rumors that they had that um little
7649300	7650620	monster-making game I guess that was

7831760	7833440	game starring a fat plumber and his
7833440	7835920	brother and a game starring a fruity elf
7835920	7839420	with big ears there you go now we're
7839420	7840940	gonna go around and get everybody's
7840940	7843140	number one answer let me read the list
7843140	7850020	list for you guys so far. A handheld system, Pokemans, the Colonel's recipe, the hot lesbian
7850020	7855820	tester, George Foreman full cow grilling machine, an expansion module for other system games,
7855820	7859620	visual memory cards, a game starring a fat plumber and his brother, and a game starring
7859620	7866880	a fruity elf with big ears. Alright, now we get down to the number one answers. The number
7866880	7873140	one thing you most want to see the Xbox 360 steal and make better. Loki. Well if they're
7873140	7879020	going to be guaranteed to make something better, I can't think of a better response than sex.
7879020	7886400	They have, there's not really much better than sex but I guess if they're going to find
7886400	7893380	a way to make it better, more power to them. So yes, Microsoft impressed me by making something
7893380	7907880	better than sex. There you go. Make sex better. You know what, Microsoft actually can't because
7907880	7913560	there's already toys. No, I'm saying they've got to find a way. They have an obligation
7913560	7919740	to steal it and make it better. So sex is what it is. Would that be like a peripheral?
7919740	7932020	Whatever it takes. They would have to defeat Hello Kitty in the Hitachi Magic Wand. Dare
7932020	7936660	I ask for your number one answer, what should they steal and make better? Rainbow farting
7936660	7943100	unicorns. Rainbow farting unicorns. Is that, are you talking about, what is that, robot
7943100	7946900	magic unicorn or whatever it is? Whatever it is. What's the name of the game? Well my
7946900	7952820	original answer, my original answer was Propel. Propel, but you want robot unicorn attack.
7952820	7962820	Farty robot unicorns. It's, it's rainbow farting unicorns. Yeah. Rainbow farting. Rainbow farting
7962820	7967580	or farting? Farting. Robot unicorns. That's a special attack cause they fart. There you
7967580	7972780	go. Alright. To an all eraser soundtrack. To an all eraser soundtrack, you got it. Or
7972780	7981620	Netshot Boys works too. Dark Sakura, you need to let it go. Okay, your number one answer,
7981620	7985660	Ellen, what is your number one answer for a thing you want Microsoft to steal and make
7985660	7993620	better? He's thinking. I'm blanking. You're blanking? After the sex thing. After the sex
7993620	8003780	thing you just can't? Help ya? Sure. The Bible. Okay, yeah. Jesus. If they could do Jesus.
8003780	8010620	Super Jesus. You don't want to do the YouTube you sent me earlier? Alright, fine. Alright.
8010620	8018780	Jesus is the idea that they're going to steal and make better. Okay. Oh lord. Alright, and
8018780	8024580	my number one answer. I, I don't know. I just kind of decided to go for the obvious. Blu-ray.
8024580	8031820	They already did. It was HD DVD. But it wasn't really better. I mean, and they were can't
8031820	8035660	kind of came out at the same time, but now that Blu-ray is out, they can take Blu-ray
8035660	8043560	and make it better. Alright. Robot Jesus attack. That'd be kind of cool. Here's the list as
8043560	8049080	it stands before the elimination. A handheld system. Pokemans. The Colonel's recipe. The
8049080	8053940	hot lesbian tester. George Foreman's full cow grilling machine. An expansion module
8053940	8058760	for other system games. Visual memory cards. A game starring a fat plumber and his brother
8058760	8065100	in a game starring a fruity elf with big ears. Sex. Rainbow farting robot unicorns. Jesus
8065100	8071580	and Blu-ray. Things that Microsoft is going to steal and make better. Loki. What is not
8071580	8076100	worthy of being on the list? Unfortunately, we got to narrow this down to eight is a tough
8076100	8081140	process. Feelings will be hurt. Hair will be pulled, but it must happen. Loki. Which
8081140	8085260	of these is not worthy of the list? Blu-ray because it's going to get phased out anyways.
8085260	8090900	You're a bastard. All right. Blu-rays off the list. Dark Sakura. Which of these is not
8090900	8100060	worthy of the list? Sex. You eliminated sex. It's overrated. They're going to make it better.
8100060	8109900	Come on. Better sex. I mean, this is dark soccer has eliminated from the list. Why?
8109900	8114140	I don't want it on the list. No, I understand, but it's just funny. Our chat room is going
8114140	8119060	to yell on screen. There's going to be hair pulling. It's boring. It is boring. They're
8119060	8123980	going to make it better. No, it'll, it'll launch. And then all of a sudden red rings.
8123980	8130020	Oh no. And it won't matter for the guys involved. They never have a problem. I don't want to
8130020	8136260	wear red rings on my balls. All right. It'll be, it'll be over before the women enjoy it.
8136260	8143500	All right. Alan, which of these is not worthy? Oh, dark soccer is getting booed by chat.
8143500	8151500	Go in there and regulate dark soccer. All right. Alan, which of these is not worthy
8151500	8158860	of the list? The hot lesbian tester. Oh, you bastard. Why do you not love lesbians? No
8158860	8164580	way to messing around person. Why are you taking the hot lesbian tester off the list?
8164580	8173660	I don't know. Just cause it's my answer. Dick. All right. You're going to, you're going to
8173660	8179960	wish that the three 60 had the sex support pretty soon. All right. Um, the item I'm going
8179960	8185700	to eliminate from the list. Um, I am taking off, I'm taking off the George Foreman full
8185700	8191140	cow grilling machine because that joke is so 2007. It's the PS three that looks like
8191140	8195860	one. Yeah. I don't want them to copy that. That's the PS three things. Let Sony have
8195860	8200700	something. All right. So that's why I've eliminated from the list. So here we go. Lim can only
8200700	8206940	do veal. These are the eight that you can vote for tonight. A handheld system pokey
8206940	8213400	man's the Colonel's recipe, an expansion module for other system games, visual memory cards,
8213400	8217700	a game starring a fat plumber and his brother in a game starring a fruity elf with big ears,
8217700	8223840	rainbow farting robot unicorns and Jesus, which of these should they steal and make
8223840	8232640	better? Send a private message to sky in the chat room with your two votes. And if you
8232640	8238200	want the blur beta code, I have two to give away tonight. Send in your votes and the message
8238200	8243160	that says, I want the blur beta code or something along those lines. If you don't want the blur
8243160	8247760	beta code, don't send me that message, but you can still send me your votes. Okay. So
8247760	8254080	you send me an additional message that says, um, I want the blur beta code. All right.
8254080	8258280	If you don't know how to send a private message, I will recap that process for you in chat
8258280	8265480	real soon for now, back to the show. While those votes come in, some folks in chat said,
8265480	8268800	we made the list boring. We took off every single interesting answer. We took off the
8268800	8274200	lesbians, the sex, the meat. Everything was gone. All right. Uh, by the way, the beta
8274200	8279300	code is only on the three 60. You must have a three 60. Please do not ask for the code.
8279300	8282960	If you yourself are not going to use it. If you sell that shit on eBay, I will find you
8282960	8290160	and I will end your life. All right. Moving on. She didn't really sell those codes. I
8290160	8294020	mean, considering that they're floating around. Exactly. All right. Loki, what do you have
8294020	8301180	for us while I start to tally up the votes? Um, so Bethesda and in exile have announced
8301180	8305060	that they're going to be putting out a new game called hunted the demons forge. It's
8305060	8312200	a co-op, looks like a hack and slash game. Kind of looks neat. And um, they say it's
8312200	8318920	going to take us back to our roots. And apparently it's like a warriors and archers and putting
8318920	8325080	holes through things with sharp objects. And apparently it will be in, it's in development
8325080	8333640	for Xbox three 60 and PS three and games for windows. And this was, I don't know, gets
8333640	8338380	shown off at a GDC. Was this like the top secret game that Bethesda is supposedly working
8338380	8342460	on that everybody thought was the blizzard MMO? I don't know, but it looks like it's
8342460	8348800	just like a hack and slash game. Looks cool though. It looks really neat, but I mean,
8348800	8352920	I don't know if this is the top secret game they're working on and this is Bethesda, not
8352920	8360260	blizzard. All right. Oh, I meant to say Bethesda. I say blizzard. Sorry. I'm getting distracted
8360260	8364760	with the cage, uh, tallying the votes for, um, listless right now. Um, let me get to
8364760	8373560	this next story real quick about layoffs at IGN. Unfortunately layoffs have, uh, hit IGN
8373560	8378900	and um, yep, too bad. So sad. Sorry to hear it. Uh, but unfortunately a lot of folks got
8378900	8385640	laid off over at IGN and um, I don't know, I guess that'll be less podcast now. All right.
8385640	8393320	Times are tough and it's not funny when people lose their jobs, but um, you know, it's tough
8393320	8400400	out there. It's hard out there for a pimp. What can I say? If they really love games,
8400400	8404560	there'll be people doing it for free, just like, um, you know, many other people do.
8404560	8408240	So we'll see. No one in particular, Rob, right? No, no one in particular. All right, let's
8408240	8412200	get to the mailbag. Every week you guys send us emails, mailbag at orange lounge reader.com
8412200	8418200	and we read some here on air. Darkstalker is going to open up the mailbag, rip it right
8418200	8422240	open and pull out some of her favorite emails. I'm reading them for you right now. I would
8422240	8427240	be happy to, but my window that had all the emails on it actually just, uh, completely
8427240	8431100	vanished. I have to reopen. Can you reopen it real quick? Okay. Cause I got to tally
8431100	8437520	the cage match votes here or yeah, sorry. Listless votes. I'm pulling it back up. Okay.
8437520	8441680	Hold your, keep your pants on to do. I don't want dead air. Look, Loki, what are you watching
8441680	8445820	over there? Here we go. I've got the first one. I'm watching a violent video of someone
8445820	8452560	making levels in a worry where a DIY like blowing someone in half. Uh, here's another
8452560	8459720	one there. I'm shooting them. Yeah. Shooting with rainbow farts, sniper rifle. This is
8459720	8464340	from cheeseburger. Yay. Hey, as you may or may not know, I've been saving up for gaming
8464340	8469800	PC for a year now. I finally got the money just this morning and I spent 1300 at new
8469800	8473960	egg. This PC will be good enough to run almost any game on your highest settings. The only
8473960	8478600	games I have right now, a world of Warcraft addict and command and conquer three and a
8478600	8484280	few hours and hoping to win an eBay auction of crisis. My question is, do you have any
8484280	8488600	recommendations for games I should get when the game was released? It was no matter just
8488600	8497720	that they're good games. I suggest loom. Um, Star Trek online. I don't know. Some of the
8497720	8503040	like Borderlands is pretty cool if you don't have that. He also sends a follow up to the
8503040	8507080	email. Forgot to mention in my last email yesterday, my friend had a 16th birthday party
8507080	8510800	at John's incredible pizza. I know what a place for that. And I was wondering why have
8510800	8513720	you given it the title Johnson, incredibly shitty pizza. Wait, wait, we have somebody
8513720	8517960	here local that been to John's incredibly shitty pizza because those are only in Norcal
8517960	8522400	as far as I know, unless they really grew over grew fast. Well, did you eat the pizza
8522400	8526360	when you were there? It's kind of shitty and it's been sitting out for a long time and
8526360	8530920	little kids put their hands all over it and all that stuff. No, the place is okay. I mean,
8530920	8534880	actually I gotta say it was really cool cause one of the workers there once like recognize
8534880	8538800	this. I don't know how, but they did. And I thought that was really awesome. So Dan
8538800	8543040	was there too. Exactly. So, uh, you know, no, they're, they're fine. I have nothing
8543040	8546520	against John's incredible pizza, but it's a fun, you gotta admit pretty fun. The pizza
8546520	8552360	was pretty suck. All right, there you go. All right. Um, from Robert M from my last
8552360	8556960	email a month or two ago, I tried to be clever and use a reference to the spam filters used
8556960	8560520	on your forums discussion on the show. So my email was most likely lost to the spam
8560520	8565800	filters. Sorry about that. My question now is how long are the animations for the summons
8565800	8570240	for final fantasy 13 and can they be skipped? My brother back in the day generally enjoyed
8570240	8574240	final fantasy seven but was turned off by the summons taking about what, 10 to 15 seconds
8574240	8578840	every time, which can actually add up to get repetitive over the course of your typical
8578840	8585800	40 hour JRPG lifespan. Rob. Sorry, I'm focusing on tallying votes. What was the question?
8585800	8591760	I haven't seen it. How long are the, are the, are the, we have a shit ton of votes tonight.
8591760	8596240	How long are the summons scenes? Not very long. And no, I don't think you can, but they're
8596240	8601160	not very long. No, you can skip them. You can't get, Oh, okay. I wish you could skip
8601160	8605040	nights of the round. Seriously. When I would do nights of the round on quadra magic and
8605040	8613280	then mimic I had time to go make a sandwich, face myself a drink, come back, how that when
8613280	8617000	square heard all of the complaints about nights of the round for seven and they're like, how
8617000	8620920	can we get around this for eight? They're like, Oh, I know. Let's make it so where you
8620920	8625360	have to watch the summit and tap square for the boost. Do you remember that? That was
8625360	8632280	their answer to that to make you watch it with the power up. Yeah, that was funny. Next
8632280	8637480	up, that's all part of the reason why I hated eight. Just so you know, this person didn't
8637480	8642480	sign it, so I'm just going to say person who didn't sign their email. Um, have been wondering,
8642480	8646120	have been enjoying the, or maybe I'll just use the first part of their email. Sepwin,
8646120	8649800	I guess. Um, I have been enjoying the show for a while. One comment about Microsoft's
8649800	8654800	project Natal. You mentioned one thing they showed were racing games. As someone who's
8654800	8660840	gotten heavy into sim racing games, I think that wouldn't work well even for arcade racers.
8660840	8664500	Main reason is there would be no rumble or force feedback to the player. For any racing
8664500	8668160	game that isn't meant to be a total arcade experience, a wheel with feedback, preferably
8668160	8672960	force feedback is critical. I would argue even burnout games need some sort of tactile
8672960	8678360	response to the player. Best wishes. I agree, actually. That's what I kind of like. Like,
8678360	8686480	what was it that, um, Rush had really crazy feedback? And it actually made it really fun
8686480	8694160	to play, I thought. You know, added a much bigger level into the control. Anyway, last
8694160	8702160	email. Um, subject, Rogue Kitty. Okay. All be aware President Katt has gone rogue. He
8702160	8711760	shall forever be known as Dictator Katt. Mwahahaha. Snow villagers. Okay. I guess. Oh, it came
8711760	8723280	with a picture. Oh, pfft. Hahahaha. War on string may be unwinnable, says General Katt.
8723280	8730360	That's funny. I'm gonna save the picture. I'll upload it somewhere. Perhaps our photo
8730360	8739760	thing. Perhaps. Anyway, that's the last of it. Ah, I'm not done telling votes yet, but
8739760	8744200	we have some more news to get to, right? Or no, we got the FUs of the week. Some angst.
8744200	8748080	Every week we like to take a little bit of our time out and get some angst out and some
8748080	8752040	anger. And hopefully there's enough of it tonight to, uh, get me through the rest of
8752040	8756280	the cage match votes. I keep saying cage match. Listless votes. Alright, uh, let's get to
8756280	8781960	the FUs of the week, boys and girls. Um, FU to my digestion. Really. That's it. Loki.
8781960	8791920	Um, I'm gonna have to say FU to, um, I don't really know. I don't have anything. I guess
8791920	8799640	the lawn being too long. I don't know. Uh, Alan, do you have an FU this week? FUs to
8799640	8808440	unemployment. Um, my FU goes to, um, all the boxes on my kitchen table. That's my FU of
8808440	8812760	the week. Alright. Uh, usually I would be doing the listless results right now, but
8812760	8817080	I'm not ready. We had so many tonight that I'm not ready. This is where I had it in our,
8817080	8820400	our list, but I'll have to jump in later. So, uh, Loki, would you do another story for
8820400	8823780	us please? By the way, we will be opening the Skype line in just a little bit, but we
8823780	8829480	have an interview with our friend Aaron in just a moment. So, uh, stay tuned. Yes. Um,
8829480	8837720	apparently bungee has reregistered or registered new trademarks for marathon and bungee aerospace.
8837720	8843760	Well marathon of course is their first FPS that they released way back in the day. Um,
8843760	8849560	so perhaps a new game in that series. Um, bungee aerospace, not exactly sure what the
8849560	8857640	hell that's about, but, um, it's interesting. They do have a logo though for bungee aerospace.
8857640	8863880	Perhaps, um, they're seeing a rebranding of the, of a studio or maybe they're gonna make
8863880	8871920	spaceships now. Who knows? Is this some type of like further halo thing or does this give
8871920	8876440	us some type of idea what they're actually going to be doing after halo? Not really.
8876440	8881400	Other than it being a trademark, I mean, obviously I would imagine marathon is going to be coming
8881400	8886040	at some point. Didn't they release marathon on Xbox live arcade and I don't remember it
8886040	8891600	being very good. I don't remember marathon. No, they did. They did. Yeah, it was, well,
8891600	8902120	you know, it was an old game. Whatever. Hmm. Would you mind doing the next story too? Cause
8902120	8905520	I'm still, I am still trying to tally votes. That's how many people we had voting tonight.
8905520	8912920	Throw in a beta code and that's what we got. Okay. Um, apparently the counter 64 is making
8912920	8923080	a return. Yes. Um, the, uh, a brand new, I guess, uh, a keyboard. Um, it looks like it's
8923080	8932560	all inclusive in this like keyboard. Um, based on they're saying the cybernet, uh, ZPC GX
8932560	8942120	31 and um, it's kinda cool looking a little futuristic thing. It's got a, I think a lot
8942120	8946320	of those pictures, I'm finally done. Sorry. I think a lot of those pictures were prototypes.
8946320	8950520	Like they're not the actual thing, especially like that one where you see the old ass system
8950520	8956160	running windows 95 or windows XP is, yeah, obviously a little bit silly, but dude, I'm
8956160	8960960	all about the counter 64 making a comeback cause there was some, that was like, I, again,
8960960	8963800	I'm hoping it's not something that I view in a greater light because it was when I was
8963800	8967440	young, but there were just some awesome programs on the 64 and I love the fact, here's the
8967440	8972240	number one reason the 64 was awesome. You could hook it up to your TV. That's why, that's
8972240	8975360	why I won the computer wars. I'm telling you, at least back in the eighties, the personal
8975360	8982480	computer wars before the IBM's. So that's kind of neat. All right. I'm finally ready.
8982480	8985840	By the way, if they re if they released a new Commodore 64, what do you think they should
8985840	8993400	put on it? I don't know. A bagel, a bunch of music making software would be good. Mario
8993400	8999920	paint put this way though, the counter 64 probably have more applications than an Apple
8999920	9005800	PC or an Apple home computer. Hopefully it would be backwards compatible. So let's get
9005800	9014440	to the list list results tonight. We're going to do the list list results. Play the music.
9014440	9019600	You voted in here. It is the definitive list of the ideas that Microsoft should steal and
9019600	9024200	make better. Here's your top three, by the way, just narrowly missing the list tonight
9024200	9028920	by one vote. Jesus, Jesus did not make the list. All right, but we have your top three
9028920	9033000	answers. We have a tie for third place, a tie for the number three thing you most want
9033000	9036800	to see Microsoft improve on. By the way, this is it. There is no arguing. This is a very
9036800	9043360	scientific process. Microsoft, if you're listening, here it is. Number three, the masses want
9043360	9049680	Pokemans. They want you to take the Pokemans and make them better and tied with that. You
9049680	9053800	might have to fry those Pokemans and the Colonel's secret recipe because you got to make that
9053800	9060260	better too. The Colonel's recipe and Pokemans tying for third place tonight. Second place
9060260	9067000	tonight, visual memory cards is what they want you to steal and make better. VMUs you
9067000	9072960	take those and make them better. And lastly, the number one thing that Microsoft needs
9072960	9080880	to steal and make better, the PSP, a handheld system. That's right, Microsoft. We want a
9080880	9085600	handheld system as voted by our chatters. That's it. No arguing. We're done. Windows
9085600	9090960	mobile, not going to cut it. You need to steal the PSP and make it better. There are two
9090960	9097080	parts to this tonight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12
9097080	9102340	people want the beta. Oh no, 11 people want the beta code. Alan, pick a number between
9102340	9110960	one and 11. If you wouldn't mind. Four, four, one, two, three, four. Congratulations. Llama
9110960	9116880	juice wins one of our beta codes tonight. So we'll be sending him a beta code in a moment.
9116880	9121840	And um, let's see, pick a number between one and 11. That's not for dark Sakura. Pick a
9121840	9126960	number between one and 11. That's not four, eight, eight, one, two, three, four, five,
9126960	9134360	six, seven, eight. Amaze Satsuma wins a blur beta code. So congratulations to you guys.
9134360	9139640	Sorry to everyone else, but there it is. So llama juice and Amaze Satsuma win beta codes
9139640	9144360	just for voting and participating in the show tonight. You can too, Sunday nights at six
9144360	9151520	o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right at all games, radio, all games.com. All right.
9151520	9158680	We're going to get to the Skypline in a minute, although I was hoping to speak to Aaron, but
9158680	9169200	I closed the number with his phone number. When I was telling all the votes, I closed
9169200	9174840	the window, um, with his number. So now I'm waiting for it. Um, so there it is. So also
9174840	9178640	I need to send those codes. So I'm going to send those codes. Loki, do you have any quick
9178640	9182720	last minute stories to work in here while I wait to hopefully hear from Aaron?
9182720	9189160	Uh, Alan Wake, several download content episodes are due out this year. Uh, second season possibly
9189160	9196160	available depending on the audience. Um, I don't know if they buy it or not or how well
9196160	9200640	the first season does. That's kind of neat. Kind of reminds me of what they're doing with
9200640	9204520	a heavy rain. They're going to be releasing some demo content seasons for that. And of
9204520	9214720	course the game is, uh, set to hit shelves on May 18th on the Xbox 360. Uh, let's see
9214720	9223040	here. There, I don't know what they're doing with this, but, uh, their casting apparently
9223040	9230320	has been, um, released for the Kane and Lynch film and Kane, um, pretty cool. They're going
9230320	9237680	to have, uh, Bruce Willis to play, uh, Kane Lynch, however, is being played by Jamie Foxx,
9237680	9246720	who I might add looks absolutely nothing like the character of Lynch. Nothing. If you think
9246720	9252720	about it, not the be all racist or anything, but a black man playing the character named
9252720	9260160	Lynch is a little weird. If you ask me. Wow. Wow. I have no response for that at all. I'm
9260160	9265480	just saying. Okay. But seriously though, Jamie Foxx, great actor, but he looks nothing like
9265480	9269840	the character. Billy Bob Thornton looks more like the character. I think of course he's
9269840	9274520	a horrible actor. Well, at least now he's a horrible actor. Well, I think, you know,
9274520	9278120	with makeup and so forth, they'll give him the mullet and the glasses and everything
9278120	9285040	he needs. Look weird in the mulling glasses. I mean, he's, it's a different race. It's
9285040	9290840	like as bad as the whole Chung Lee thing in the last street fighter movie. Not Asian.
9290840	9295840	Doesn't look anything like Chung Lee. Oh, and can act. By the way, bonds as double oh
9295840	9302880	six in chat says I am black myself and I say no. And into what Loki said, yes, yes, yes.
9302880	9308160	Same thing ran through my head. WTF. So maybe Loki is not as insensitive as real time. I
9308160	9312840	see the Prince of Persia trailer with Jake Gyllenhaal in the movie theater. Every time
9312840	9318240	I see that trailer, I just want to scream out, he's white, like to the theater. Just,
9318240	9324040	yeah, you should. I have to add, this is completely off topic here, but they finally released
9324040	9329920	the riff tracks for the new Twilight movie. I am very excited to watch that. Not that
9329920	9333880	I'm excited to watch the Twilight movies, but the riff tracks were fucking hilarious
9333880	9339280	and we watched it with the happening. Oh my God. Completely different movie watching that
9339280	9348760	is just ridiculously funny. No phone number yet. No, I got it. I got it. I'm sorry. I
9348760	9352120	was just waiting for the conversation to finish because a good times. I like it when you say
9352120	9355720	things will get you in trouble. All right, so we're going to give our good buddy Aaron
9355720	9361120	also known as Y Y R a call because he's has a brand new game on the Xbox live marketplace
9361120	9364880	and the indie game section and we want to talk to him about it. So let's get him on
9364880	9369640	the line. We're going to call him on our Skype line right now and then we'll open up the
9369640	9375040	Skype line for anybody to call in at one eight seven seven. Hello. Hey Aaron, how you doing?
9375040	9379280	I figured it was you. Hey, how'd you know? It wasn't just the whole back and forth about
9379280	9383400	he ran off to get a drink at just the wrong moment. How you doing Aaron? Congratulations.
9383400	9389280	You released a game tonight. I am. I'm doing okay, which is pretty, pretty cool considering
9389280	9395520	this has been a bumpy ride. Um, you know, losing power from west Saturday night through
9395520	9400800	this Thursday evening and basically shacking up with my parents and doing all that I could
9400800	9405200	from there. I'm working on convention crap for most of the weekend and now I think I'm
9405200	9410720	coming down with a cold. Oh goody. Now that's right. You're going to be at PAX east, right?
9410720	9415840	Now you're showing off a snake 360 in your latest game in at a booth there. I'm going
9415840	9421840	to have all, um, I'm going to have all four of my, my games. Um, three of them will have
9421840	9426920	been released up to that point. And the fourth I thought would probably have been released,
9426920	9433560	but um, it's failed review on a technicality. So, um, it'll be coming next month and of
9433560	9438000	course anyone at PAX East is going to be able to try it first. So that's kind of pretty
9438000	9442920	cool. So I'm going to turn it from a, well, it should have been out into a, it's coming
9442920	9447960	soon and you get to play it first. How cool is that? Hey, there you go. Hey, that's some,
9447960	9451360	some reason why people want to go to PAX is to play the games first. And by the way, Ziba
9451360	9455360	in our chat room is suggesting take some airborne, but as the 200 Matt says, it doesn't work.
9455360	9459960	So all right, well let's, let's talk about your latest game. So tonight on Xbox live
9459960	9463800	marketplace, you released a game called falling and we have a little clip so you can hear
9463800	9473280	some of the music. Now, as you can probably tell, this game is very retro inspired. In
9473280	9478400	fact, when I first looked at it, I was like, is this like a remake of pango or something?
9478400	9481760	But no, this just because the little guys look like penguins and they're moving around
9481760	9486640	blocks. This is something very different. I can tell, tell us a little bit about falling.
9486640	9493300	Well, um, basically what it kind of is, is it's a puzzle type game at its core. Um, what
9493300	9497280	you do is you're, you're playing the part of the penguin right there. Peppy, the penguin,
9497280	9501840	that's his name. And uh, you're running around and blocks are falling from the ceiling because
9501840	9510200	Wally the walrus is trying to get into your house. Okay. Damn that walrus. So what you
9510200	9515000	need to do is clean up the mess and then crush Wally before he causes trouble, which of course
9515000	9520960	is touching you. You die. But you know, at first also Wally starts off stupid. He just
9520960	9524600	kind of walks back and forth and waits for you to crush him either by pushing a block
9524600	9530280	on him or, you know, um, dropping it on his head or whatever. But then later on he can
9530280	9536040	push blocks around, he can jump over things, he can kick blocks at your face, you know,
9536040	9540360	just generally make life miserable for you. So, you know, you gotta get rid of him and
9540360	9544080	you also have to clear the blocks by throwing or kicking the same colored blocks into each
9544080	9551680	other. So, you know, you're matching colors, you're avoiding walking walruses and, you
9551680	9556280	know, just generally things get pretty chaotic later in the game and it's fun. It's got the
9556280	9562880	retro vibe and, you know, it plays a lot like a frenetic arcade experience, you know. I
9562880	9567160	like to compare it to, you know, something like Bubble Bobble where it starts off simple
9567160	9572440	and then it just, it gets very complex and very action packed and, you know, it, I feel
9572440	9579400	it does have the kind of lasting enjoyment that a game like that, you know, used to have.
9579400	9583720	I think I pretty much captured that spirit. It definitely looks like something that could
9583720	9589080	be from Game Room. It's kind of that old kind of retro look to it. It seems like this game
9589080	9594560	is coming out just in time, honestly, for everything. So. Yeah, well, I mean, I hope
9594560	9599040	people download it and they, you know, they get the same kind of feelings that they get
9599040	9605000	when they play one of their favorite old games and then I hope they buy it. So you can't
9605000	9607920	get the trial in the marketplace right now. I'm going to go ahead and let the, oh, you
9607920	9611520	have several videos up here on YouTube, don't you? You have like an attract mode, some other
9611520	9616200	gameplay clips. Let's try one of these other clips here on the YouTube. Now you posted
9616200	9620280	some clips of the game. This is round 10. We're going to look at analysis as I'm imagining
9620280	9624120	things get a little more intense in this level, the bricks fall faster. Actually, I was playing
9624120	9629080	on hard difficulty when I made that video, so it's kind of nuts. I don't think, I think
9629080	9634160	that video ends with my death actually. Now there's multiple, there's walrai, there's
9634160	9640600	multiple walruses. Oh yeah, they come in packs. Oh my gosh. They're like real walruses. Actually,
9640600	9644520	I'm not basing that statement on any fact whatsoever. Okay, I've got to ask you, this
9644520	9649120	seems like the most obvious question. Where did the inspiration for a game like this come
9649120	9653760	from? Where did this come to you in like a dream or something? Like dude's going to,
9653760	9657600	penguin's going to get his home invaded by walruses. Like where the hell did you come
9657600	9665040	up with this? Well, to be completely honest, um, the, the entire concept for the game started
9665040	9673040	with my, I guess now ex-fiancee's, um, you know, obsession with Piplup. That is, that
9673040	9679160	is completely true. And I wanted to make a game with a penguin in it and I thought, okay,
9679160	9682760	blocks are falling from the ceiling. And then I thought, okay, something has to come and
9682760	9687240	be an antagonist. And then, you know, I figured, well, you know, I think I heard somewhere
9687240	9692840	that walruses in real life don't like penguins. So I started going with that. And then when
9692840	9698080	I had already drawn all the sprites, I decided to actually look this up. And according to
9698080	9703480	stuff I found on Wikipedia, the simple fact of the matter is due to differences in their
9703480	9709160	habitats, walruses and penguins in real life basically never see each other. So I went
9709160	9713000	with it anyway. So you found out that walruses and penguins were like mortal enemies and
9713000	9718240	you're like, there's a game there. Yes, yes, exactly. Now I'm looking at this, you have
9718240	9721520	another video on YouTube and you can see these videos by the way, uh, listeners by going
9721520	9728520	to the website for Aaron's games. It's yyrgames.com. That's all one word, yyrgames.com. And I'm
9728520	9732200	looking at kind of like the attract mode that shows you how to play the game, but I noticed
9732200	9737160	you have it set up. Like it looks like you're playing a ROM and MAME or something. Is that,
9737160	9741000	what made you decide to go for that? That's exactly what I was going for. Is there a reason
9741000	9745040	for that? You were just like, I want to make my game feel like a MAME ROM or you know,
9745040	9749560	you just wanted to kind of enhance that retro vibe this game has going for it or what? I
9749560	9753360	totally just basically wanted to make it feel like an old arcade game. From the moment you
9753360	9757640	power up the machine and you see the ROM test and you know, it puts the option settings
9757640	9763200	on the screen for a fraction of a second to going into the options and being able to adjust
9763200	9769960	how many coins the game costs. You know, it's all in there. Nice. But no real coins. It's
9769960	9773320	much different than game room where game room charges you 50 cents a play, but that won't
9773320	9779600	happen here, right? No, no. You can try it for free, just like all indie games. And uh,
9779600	9784920	if you spend 80 space bucks, just 80 space bucks, you can play it as much as you want
9784920	9792640	for as long as you want. I think I caught, how many space bucks was that? 80. $1. $1?
9792640	9796000	That's a steal. That's great. Now what is this? I noticed, I just caught this briefly
9796000	9800420	at the end of the attract screen here, that when it's showing the high score table, it
9800420	9809200	looks like the default scores say import Futari now. What is that? Oh, nothing. No, that's
9809200	9816280	a direct reference to Mushihime from off Futari, the cave shooting game released last year.
9816280	9820600	Actually there's another game that I'm releasing soon called Sharpshooter and I make a reference
9820600	9826720	to DJ Max Technica and its high score tables. I'm all about referencing other games, other
9826720	9834000	stuff. In fact, before we end this conversation, I would like to actually directly reference
9834000	9838200	one of the in-game references that I have actually in all my games and I'm turning that
9838200	9846460	into a giveaway for three of our chat rumors. Okay. So what, the chatters have to know what
9846460	9850800	it is that all your games have in common or what? What's the deal? Well, do you want to
9850800	9860600	do it now? Sure. Why not? Okay. Well, in every game that I've released so far, Snake 360,
9860600	9865800	Card Arcade, Falling, and also in the game that I'm releasing next month, Sharpshooter,
9865800	9869640	and by the way, all those games will be on display at PAX East and I hope that everyone
9869640	9874320	who comes to PAX East will come to our booth and have a really great time. I'm going to
9874320	9879120	be next to Mommy's Best Games and they're going to have a bunch of great stuff too including
9879120	9885200	an unreleased game called Grapple Buggy. So, you know, come, play the games. I'm going
9885200	9891040	to be running Snake 360 tournaments all weekend long. You can compete for prizes, t-shirts,
9891040	9897560	soundtracks, CDs, like I decided to go all out with this. So, but at any rate, no it's
9897560	9904560	not O-L-O-R-G related. Thank you, chat. But I will absolutely stop by the booth. Absolutely
9904560	9909400	I'll be stopping by to say hello. I am looking forward to meeting you. Absolutely I'll be
9909400	9912000	by. I don't know what I'm wearing yet. Everybody's asking me what are you wearing so I can like
9912000	9918360	see, spot you and see you. I don't know. I was hoping to have my frilly orange scarf
9918360	9922520	but it looks like I'll have to save that for PAX Prime. I have this thing called homework.
9922520	9926560	I know. I know. Bakers can't be choosers. But I'll find something creative. Well, I
9926560	9930200	know, I know my friend Amanda plans to wear a corset one day so I was thinking well I
9930200	9934200	could wear a corset. But I don't know how well that would go over. So, we'll have to
9934200	9939440	see. I'll, stay tuned to the Twitter folks. I'll let you know. Alright, but anyway, back
9939440	9947440	to the giveaway. Yes. So, in all of the games that I'm, that I have released or am releasing,
9947440	9952520	I have a number in there. It's usually in the form of in one of the high score numbers
9952520	9957520	and it's a direct reference to a video game company. The first three people to type it
9957520	9965320	into chat get a code to download falling for free. Woo hoo. Free falling. Save, save that
9965320	9970920	dollar by typing that number into chat right now. So, and. Not the number. I don't need
9970920	9975160	the number. I need the video game company that I reference. Oops, my bad. It's not Konami.
9975160	9980800	My bad. The video game company he references and he flat out has told you it is not Konami.
9980800	9986200	So, go ahead and guess. There it is. And you know what? And you know what? If, yeah, I'm
9986200	9992760	not seeing it yet, so I'm just gonna say what the number is. Okay. It's 765. I'm trying
9992760	9998160	to think what that reference is. It's gotta be like a. 765. It's gotta be, it's probably
9998160	10005480	very similar to the whole 573 thing. It's. It's not Konami. It's not Bungie. Me, me.
10005480	10012360	I see it. I'm waiting for two other people to say it before I confirm it. What, what's
10012360	10018200	the list of what it's not? It's not Konami. And the number is 765. Okay, three people
10018200	10022800	wrote Namco. We're done. Oh, Namco. Tell us a little more about the reference to Namco.
10022800	10031040	Yes, I am basically a Namco fangirl. Uh huh. So many of Namco's games are on my all time
10031040	10037280	list of favorites that I couldn't possibly not be a Namco fangirl. So I'm basically referencing
10037280	10043360	them in, well, everything. Nice. And you know what? Hey, hey, I will say this. I, you know,
10043360	10047480	we've, we've had our creative differences with Namco in the past. I'll just leave it
10047480	10053000	that way. But I will say this. This made me a giddy little fangirl as well is that in,
10053000	10056580	and I apologize for the listeners that have heard this story 5,000 times, but you know
10056580	10063320	I love this story. In the Namco PS3 game, the Namco Treasures Volume 1, there is a direct
10063320	10068560	OLR reference like in your face. It, it, when you go in, yes, when you go into the game,
10068560	10071720	it's, and it has to be the full version. It doesn't work in the demo. So you have to buy
10071720	10076820	the full version. But when you go in, there's a splash screen that shows like a sample cause
10076820	10080720	it's just showing off the new online features and there's a demo high score table and like
10080720	10085560	friends list and you see OLR in the high score table and then the person's friends list is
10085560	10090680	Sky, Dark Soccer, and Loki. Oh wow, I gotta go run and check that right now. No kitty,
10090680	10095080	it's on the PS3 and it's the Namco Treasures Volume 1. It's the one that has like Pac-Man
10095080	10098720	and, and all that stuff. I think I actually downloaded that. I, I don't know if I still
10098720	10102360	have it on the hard drive, but it's not. I'm getting it again. But it's not in the demo.
10102360	10105040	I just want to make that clear. You will not see it in the demo. That splash screen is
10105040	10109560	only in the full version. Cause the way the PS3 works is funky. Your demo is like completely
10109560	10113440	separate from your regular game. It's not like the 360 where you upgrade. Yeah, I know.
10113440	10119000	I'm not happy about it either. Yeah. So again, if you hadn't heard that story before, I love
10119000	10124640	that story so much. I totally support that. That's when you know you made it. We've been
10124640	10129800	doing this show for eight years to get our name in a video game was amazing. So we were
10129800	10134080	very happy about that. Well, Aaron, I want to wish you the best of luck with your release.
10134080	10138720	And again, if our chatters want to stay on top of your releases, Y Y R games.com real
10138720	10142880	quick, cause I wanted to ask this at some point, how long does it take you to make these
10142880	10148520	games? Give us an idea. How long did falling take? Start to finish. I started falling.
10148520	10156640	I'd say probably around September or October of last year. And now granted I was working
10156640	10161600	on sharpshooter, which is my release for next month at the same time. And by the way, if
10161600	10166000	you're developing a game, I would very, very strongly recommend that you never, ever try
10166000	10171520	to work on two at the same time, because as with most things, it'll probably wind up taking
10171520	10176440	you longer, you know, to finish both than if you just did one and then the other. But
10176440	10181640	yeah, it, it does take a while because you know, it's, you could have a basic version
10181640	10185720	of the game up and running very quickly, but if you really want to polish it, if you want
10185720	10189960	to, you know, take the time to work out all the kinks, if you want to have great sound
10189960	10196560	effects, music, graphics, every, every bit of it needs time spent on it. So, you know,
10196560	10202960	if you really, really have to spend a whole lot of time and effort on it. So, you know,
10202960	10207120	one thing I say to people, people really just don't realize how much time goes into a game.
10207120	10211400	The next time you're walking through a 3d environment and a first person shooter, you
10211400	10218720	know, don't just run past that, that intricately designed building and never look at it again.
10218720	10223280	You know, actually take the time to look at it and admire what, you know, a bunch of designers
10223280	10229440	worked on because they spent hours on that and we run past it in five seconds. It's amazing
10229440	10233440	all the detail that goes into that type of work. It's kind of like a movie. There's,
10233440	10236640	you know, the list of credits at the end of the movie, it really does take that many people
10236640	10244080	to make a movie, but this game falling was made by one guy, right? There it is. Well,
10244080	10248800	Aaron, good luck. I hope your hard work pays off guys. If you have the dollar, just go,
10248800	10253760	go spend the dollar, go support some indie gamers, go check it out on the Xbox live indie
10253760	10258760	marketplace falling snake three lucky winners. Watch your PMs. All right. And if you want
10258760	10264440	to follow Aaron, the website, yyrgames.com congrats on the release, Aaron. And, uh, I
10264440	10269440	hope you make some money. Oh, uh, I'm, I'm just looking to get my name out there and
10269440	10274960	maybe make enough to someday do this for a living. I'm not looking to make a fortune
10274960	10279520	or anything. Sounds, that sounds like a fair compromise. We'll see you at PAX East Aaron.
10279520	10283480	All right. You see that? All right. I'll probably be assaulting you with a microphone there
10283480	10288160	too. Just so you know. That's just fine. All right. Good luck. See you at the show. See
10288160	10294040	you later later. Aaron also known as yyr from yyrgames.com and a yeah, a little reminder
10294040	10298840	in our chat room. And, uh, this is also important. Speaking of indie games, uh, Bobby references
10298840	10303640	on his show earlier, but, uh, our, um, podcasting friends at a dead pixel live, they're another
10303640	10308960	all game show. Uh, the guy there, Derek, he develops indie games too, and he put one out
10308960	10314120	not that long ago called you will die. Well, apparently it is now the first Xbox live indie
10314120	10319280	game to have an official twin galaxy scoreboard, which I think is kind of interesting. So,
10319280	10324240	uh, yeah, that's, that's very cool. So congratulations to Derek on that accomplishment. Who knows?
10324240	10328600	Maybe falling being a retro game could, could be next. Who knows? We'll see. I don't know
10328600	10331800	if that'll open the flood gates, but, uh, congrats to all of our friends that are indie
10331800	10335520	developers, man. That takes, it takes a lot of work. Like I wish I had that kind of talent.
10335520	10340180	I would make an OLR game. I think that would be fun, but we'll see. All right. Are we ready
10340180	10344680	to go to the phones and take some calls tonight? Why not? I think so. We're only going to take
10344680	10348520	a couple of calls tonight, guys. I apologize to those that don't get through tonight. We
10348520	10354080	just, uh, we got a lot of show done tonight. So, uh, one eight seven seven game. OLR is
10354080	10358160	the number to call or our username on Skype is orange lounge radio. Loki real quick. Did
10358160	10361760	you have any other last minute stories before we, um, get to the phones? Yeah, there's this
10361760	10365920	new game. It's a new music game coming out called power gig rise of the six string, which
10365920	10371160	kind of neat about it is it actually uses a guitar controller that is a real electric
10371160	10374880	guitar. You can convert it into, well, you plug in an amp into it and it's a real electric
10374880	10379280	guitar, but it will teach you how to play a guitar. By the way, YYR wants to say he
10379280	10383640	is running a high score contest on falling and you have to check YYR games.com for more
10383640	10389320	details. Our phone lines are like flooded. I'm just going to take a call here and we're
10389320	10394080	going to go ahead and go to the phones. Hi, you're on. Whoa. I see webcam. We don't get
10394080	10399200	those calls much higher on orange launch radio. Who's this? Howdy. This is llama juice. Hey,
10399200	10405000	llama juice. Congrats. You won the blur beta, right? Yes, I did have fun with that. Good
10405000	10409880	luck with that. All right. Hopefully your video doesn't screw up our, um, bandwidth,
10409880	10412680	but we'll see what happens. Oh no, he shut it off. All right. That's all right. What's
10412680	10417840	up? What's up llama juice? No, that's okay. It's cool. What's on your mind? I went down
10417840	10425800	to a GDC in San Francisco, uh, last week ish. Yeah. And uh, I, I don't know if you guys
10425800	10430520	like, I, I, I got to the show late last week, so I didn't get to hear about anything you
10430520	10433840	guys were talking about. No, we didn't go to the show, which is funny because we're
10433840	10437320	not that, you must be in the area cause we're, we're just in Sacramento, so we're not that
10437320	10441880	far from San Francisco. In fact, Alan is from there, so I go there all of the time and I
10441880	10447000	was there that weekend. But uh, you know, GDC, they don't really let media people in,
10447000	10452360	so I didn't go. They actually do have media passes. You, you should, you should try that
10452360	10456780	next time. Yeah, but unfortunately it's kind of one of those double edged swords. Indie
10456780	10463280	podcasters aren't really a media enough for a them. Fair enough. So you have to work for
10463280	10469240	IGN or well, I guess I guess the media passes will be opening up next time. All right. Uh,
10469240	10474760	so what, how, how was GDC? What'd you think? Um, the conference itself was really awesome.
10474760	10481320	I'm an environment artist trying to try to get a job. So for, to go there, it was basically
10481320	10486280	a giant job fair, you know, with all the big companies and whatnot trying to, trying to
10486280	10494640	hire people. Um, but what was neat is that like all of the, all of the different, uh,
10494640	10502040	like Sony and Microsoft had booths there too showing off all their stuff and uh, Sony was
10502040	10507760	showing off their, their PlayStation move. Did you get your hands on it? Yes. Ah, I want
10507760	10511920	to know what you thought then. I definitely want to know what you thought of move. Um,
10511920	10515840	I was out opening day picking up the week, you know, I was out there waiting outside
10515840	10524100	for 14 hours and uh, the, the move puts the weed of shame hands down. Wow. The controls
10524100	10532760	for it were extremely responsive. Um, the, the demos that they showed were, it was a
10532760	10538840	lot of, um, really, really cheesy stuff. Like there was a little game with where you made
10538840	10545920	bubbles and a monkey tried to pop the bubbles. But, uh, as far as like the controlling of
10545920	10553400	it all went, it like, it was very one to one, very, very quick and responsive. Is that all
10553400	10557540	you played was the monkey bubble game or were there other stuff you got to check out? There
10557540	10563080	was the monkey bubble game. There was like the, that tech demo that they showed at E3,
10563080	10567760	like right when they showed it off, they had that there. Um, and then they had some other
10567760	10573520	game that I watched some girl play where she was like swinging some swords and mallets
10573520	10579600	or something around and she was getting really into it and it looked like it was very responsive
10579600	10587840	as to what she was doing and, and all that. Um, they were showing that, uh, if you have
10587840	10593320	the two controllers, it actually, the camera itself can actually do face tracking as well.
10593320	10599880	Oh wow. And so the, the camera can like see your face and the two remotes and then guess
10599880	10606560	where your arms are and all that. And so it can do like full bot or it tries to do like,
10606560	10611040	um, sensing, you know, where your body is. And so if you're docking and stuff like that,
10611040	10616180	it can, it can try to replicate that with a character on screen. Interesting. So it's
10616180	10619400	got a little bit of that because that's kind of the stuff that they're selling when the
10619400	10622200	tall. So it's interesting to hear that move kind of has a little bit of that built in.
10622200	10626640	So I think a lot of us are thinking of it as only a we rip off right now. So to hear
10626640	10630400	that it's got a little additional camera features is kind of cool. I will tell you something
10630400	10633840	though that when we were talking about this last week, I think one place where we were
10633840	10639640	critical of move, although, you know, I think we all see it as a logical step for Sony and
10639640	10643920	we all know they've had more time now to perfect the technology. So it better be better. But
10643920	10648600	the big question is, does it have the games to substantiate it? Because you know, if it's
10648600	10653280	just another bunch of little mini party games and so forth, then what's the point? Do you
10653280	10658720	think from what you observed that move has the, let's just go back to the old OLR golden
10658720	10663920	rule rule of a video game system is only as good as the games that are on it. Do you think
10663920	10670400	that move has the games to substantiate the controller?
10670400	10675960	From what they showed at GDC, they really only showed one game, like one full game with
10675960	10682320	it. And I didn't really see much of it. But I was talking to the guy that like the main
10682320	10687360	main guy behind the whole technology of it all. And he was saying that new SOCOM that's
10687360	10695240	going to be coming out is going to be using it very in depth. And so he's saying that,
10695240	10700000	you know, the controls for that are going to be pretty sweet. So if SOCOM is going to
10700000	10709760	be using it, I guess that's a really big title for Sony. I don't have a PS3. So I don't know.
10709760	10716960	Then even better, is this the type of peripheral that makes you want to get one?
10716960	10722280	And I've always been a sucker for the gimmicky, gimmicky crap in games. Like, you know, I
10722280	10728080	have all of, like I had, I got the Game Boy printer, the e-reader, you know, I bought
10728080	10735160	the Wii opening day, all that kind of stuff. And so this, this kind of thing, it, it does
10735160	10744960	make me want to buy a PS3. The guy said that as far as prices, the unit's going to come
10744960	10751000	out with a controller, a game, and the camera all under a hundred dollars when it comes
10751000	10752000	out.
10752000	10754600	Yeah, I remember that. They did have a little press conference. They said some of that,
10754600	10757320	but yeah, I wonder what, I wonder if it's going to be the Monkey Bubble game or what
10757320	10763500	it's going to be. So we'll see. Well, real quickly before we let you go, because we want
10763500	10767120	to try to get at least one more call tonight. Were there any other quick thoughts you had
10767120	10770720	about GDC or something like really interesting? Did you attend any panels or I don't know
10770720	10774200	if they call them panels or seminars or what have you, that you just thought were awesome
10774200	10775800	and you want to share?
10775800	10781560	Um, sadly I didn't get to go to any of the, they, they call them summits there. Um, I
10781560	10787880	didn't get to go to any of those because I got the cheap pass, which was still $250 plus
10787880	10793560	I live in Orlando, so, uh, I didn't really have the extra.
10793560	10797720	Oh, you came all the way out here just for that then. Wow. Cool.
10797720	10805760	Um, but what I will say is if you don't mind a little, a little plug here, um, I did a
10805760	10812040	vlog every day as I was out there, recorded anything fun that I saw at the expo. Um, if
10812040	10816520	you want to see any, if you want to see any of that, uh, I have a YouTube channel, uh,
10816520	10823600	youtube.com slash llama juice, all one word. Um, so if you go there, you can see a lot
10823600	10827640	of the, a lot of the cool stuff that they had at the expo. They had a lot of virtual
10827640	10835920	reality stuff going on. Um, a lot of 3d like glasses with gaming. Um, a lot of stuff like
10835920	10839400	that going on. It was some, some pretty cool technology going on there.
10839400	10843600	All right. So check that out on youtube. Uh, we'll go, we'll go ahead and let you plug
10843600	10846480	that, especially cause we weren't out there ourselves. So I might actually be going to
10846480	10850040	look and see what it was like out there on the show floor. So llama juice, good luck
10850040	10855280	with blur. Good luck with your schooling for all the environmental stuff. And, uh, we'll
10855280	10860880	see you later on the show. Okay. Sounds like a plan. All right. Take care, buddy. Yep.
10860880	10865960	You too. Later. We'll take like one more call guys. And I really apologize in advance for
10865960	10868520	those folks that don't get through tonight. Please, please, please don't be afraid to
10868520	10873100	send us an email, send us some tweets. Uh, one of the other ways. It's just that our
10873100	10877520	show is running really long tonight. So, uh, we wanted to just take a couple more calls.
10877520	10880560	You guys, I'm just gonna take this first one here. Hi, you're on orange on radio. Who's
10880560	10886240	this? Good morning. This is G that's calling him. Hi, G that's. Oh, it's the other Swede,
10886240	10892640	right? Oh yes. How are you? My friend. How's it going? Uh, I'm not too bad. A bit tired.
10892640	10899040	I've been up since two AM. That is hardcore. My friends hardcore. I really appreciate your
10899040	10903040	support. Well, what's on your mind, please. You stayed up late to talk to us. What's up?
10903040	10907720	Uh, you already talked about it, I think, but I just want to talk a bit more about Cave
10907720	10912800	Story and its awesomeness. If you haven't played it, you really, really need to play
10912800	10917660	it because it's freeware on PC and if you really like it on PC, you can always buy it
10917660	10922480	on WiiWare because he really deserves it. It's just one guy who made one of the most
10922480	10930480	awesome games ever. Now, where, where can people get this game? Uh, I think there's
10930480	10935720	a different, like a tribute site that has a download with an English patch because the
10935720	10940420	guy who made it is Japanese. Oh, okay. But I don't, I don't think he has his own like
10940420	10944600	developer site. It's Studio Pixel, I think he calls himself. He's usually just referred
10944600	10949880	to as Pixel. Now, what is it about this game that just made you fall in love with it? Uh,
10949880	10956040	it's sort of retro, the music's awesome, the story's actually kind of entertaining and
10956040	10961840	it has a, has a couple of twists. It's not your usual Mario, oh, the princess is in another
10961840	10966920	castle. You can't really predict what's going to happen. And it's just an unexplored fantasy
10966920	10975080	world that you've never seen before. And I like the price of free. That's good. Has anybody
10975080	10978360	been able to like follow the guy? I know there's like the language differences, but has anybody
10978360	10982000	been able to follow the guy and see if there's a chance of this, like, I don't know, being
10982000	10989280	an indie game on Xbox Live or coming out somewhere else besides just the PC? I'm not sure. It
10989280	10996160	is coming out on, on WiiWare and I think they had like a report on the Wii channel with
10996160	11003400	him and the American developers who met with him and like made the port. But I'm not sure,
11003400	11007880	maybe they have like an exclusivity deal with Nintendo because they probably want to keep
11007880	11013400	that. Maybe, maybe there's a WiiWare thing coming up. And I do notice, by the way, speaking
11013400	11018280	of WiiWare, I guess Dark Tetsuya is all excited. I think La Mulana's released is must be tomorrow
11018280	11021920	because I can't think of what else Dark Tetsuya would be excited over, but I know he's in
11021920	11025560	there. By the way, did you know Dark Sakura? I know you've been busy with your stuff, but
11025560	11030200	a Rondo of Blood finally saw the light of day on Monday. So a part of me wants to hook
11030200	11037080	up the Wii and get that. You should. I do. I need to, but it's, it's in a box. Rob, what?
11037080	11040600	You know how we were supposed to hang out last week and we didn't. I know. I can't this,
11040600	11045320	I'm going to Boston. I know. I'm going to Boston. When you're back. Okay. Rondo of Blood.
11045320	11049720	We need to do our show that we've talked about. Yes, we do. We can start with Rondo of Blood.
11049720	11055640	It would be fun. Anyway, hi. Heck yeah. Sorry, listener. Well, well Dark Sakura and I have
11055640	11060200	an argument. Jiditz, I guess I'll ask you, is there, is there anything else in your mind
11060200	11065440	tonight? I just, you said last time that you wanted to know like the phrases in different
11065440	11072640	languages when people come in. Yes. So I thought I'd just saying like hi is just hey or hello.
11072640	11081920	Oh, that's easy. Hello. Hello. Yeah. Hello. Yeah. Hello. Okay. I can do that. And goodbye
11081920	11090160	is like hey door. Hey door. Yeah. Hey door. Hey door. Excellent. Can you go out to the
11090160	11096240	barn and close the hey door? All right. I'll try. All right. No, I really appreciate that.
11096240	11100800	And now I need AKA Ripper to call in next, which by the way, too bad we already did our
11100800	11104560	game show tonight because you and AKA Ripper are both listening tonight. We could have
11104560	11110320	had a sweet off. I know you already decided to bow down and, and, and let, let AKA Ripper
11110320	11115200	have the title, but dammit, I wanted my sweet off, but I guess, I guess it is to be for
11115200	11118960	another day because we are running way too long tonight. We're almost like, I think we're
11118960	11122320	like to three and a half hours at this point. So I almost have to go to school soon. Yeah.
11122320	11126560	We got to go and wrap this up. Well, you, uh, better get to school young man. And, uh,
11126560	11129840	we'll talk to you later. Okay. Yep. Have a good one, buddy.
11130560	11134880	So do you buy later? All right. Thank you guys so much for our calls again. I really,
11134880	11138640	our phones were like lit up tonight. Like if I, if we took every single call,
11138640	11145040	we would be here until G did like was getting home from school. So, uh, but we need to, uh,
11145040	11151760	uh, turn off the phones for tonight again. Uh, please email, please Twitter, please Facebook
11151760	11156800	and all the other ways that we let you guys have a voice chat room, all of that fun stuff.
11157920	11161600	All right. Ooh. Now's the part of the show where we wrap it all up. I think we got all
11161600	11165200	of Loki's last minute stories, dark soccer. I don't know if you had any mesmerized by
11165200	11169440	reading about the healthcare passing. Yeah. It's on a lot of people's minds
11169440	11173520	today. I don't want to get too political, but, um, it's definitely a historical day.
11173520	11176240	It's a day that will be remembered. I was just looking to find out what
11176240	11179760	the specifics were because keep in mind, all I've been hearing is all the crap from my
11179760	11185200	Republican slash libertarian family. And while I have a good deal in common with
11186160	11189440	the libertarian platform, there are certain things that I think need to be done.
11189440	11194400	I'm not going to go into it, but I've been trying to see what exactly made it. So,
11194400	11197600	So what exactly is this again? Is this that national healthcare thing? Do I have to pay
11197600	11200960	more taxes for people that don't have jobs so they can get their fucking healthcare?
11200960	11204000	Cause that's what it seems like it's like anyways already.
11205120	11210800	Um, I think they are going to tax the really high, high, high plans like the Cadillac plan.
11210800	11214720	So that was what I was just reading. If you have a really nice plan, you might,
11214720	11217360	but if your plan has like any deductibles or anything like that,
11217360	11221120	it's probably not one of those plans. Well, the biggest thing on here is that, um,
11222640	11227920	instead of treating symptoms with Existrix, basically the car dealer type of deal where
11227920	11232800	you get more money for the options that go with it, then the focus will be on curing the problem
11232800	11237040	and not the symptoms of the problem, not treating the symptoms, not getting a kickback for selling
11237040	11242160	prescriptions, basically. I will say this much. I don't want to get too much into what I do for
11242160	11248480	a living and to earn my paychecks, but I do work for a big healthcare, um, uh, company here in
11248480	11253280	California. And I'll just say, I'm really interested for work tomorrow. It's going to be a heck of a day
11253280	11260000	tomorrow. So I'm just, I'm very curious to see what's going to happen. But, um, you know, change
11260000	11265760	is always inevitable. And I think this is one of those things that, um, what was going to happen.
11265760	11270320	So we'll, we'll see what happens. My only, I will just say this. My only concern about the whole
11270320	11275440	thing is that I think that all of the other government programs need major revamping. So,
11275440	11280560	because I think that, yeah, you can change one thing, but you really have to look at what the
11280560	11285040	absolute root of the problem is. And I think that that's with the government itself. I don't know
11285040	11289440	necessarily that I trust them with my money. I just hope we get a new trauma center game out of
11289440	11295120	all this. That's what I really want. Trauma center healthcare bill. They could make a game out of
11295120	11301040	trying to pass a trauma center senate. Have you seen the South Park that was, uh, earlier this
11301040	11306560	week where they were mocking the whole Tiger Woods 11 and it was, you know, like heavy rain almost
11306560	11311600	where he's fighting off his wife or his girlfriend or whatever. No, I hadn't heard. It's about heavy
11311600	11315840	rain. No, it was, it was like, you know, they're, they're playing the game or whatever and he's
11315840	11320880	doing the apology and all of a sudden, you know, she comes up on stage and starts like beating
11320880	11327360	them up with the, uh, with the golf club and cheeses, the prenup, uh, power up and stuff
11327360	11333200	like that. It's pretty funny. I love SSJ was 100 Matt's comment and I'm even going to make it my
11333200	11337040	final thought tonight. So we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought tonight. Uh,
11337040	11340480	and I'm going to leave it with what SSJ 100 Matt said. Cause I think it's great
11340480	11346080	change. It's always good because you can take it all to coin star. Low key your final thought
11346080	11352640	tonight. I need me some money. Alan, thank you for being here on the show tonight. I hope you
11352640	11355680	got to say more than you did last time. I think you did participating in listless really helped
11355680	11360160	you. Is there any final thought you have tonight? I want tacos. We'll get tacos. We'll get your
11360160	11365040	tacos. You want Del Taco or Taco Bell? Uh, Del Taco. All right. See, look what I've turned him
11365040	11371040	into. This Bay area kid has fallen in love with Del Taco. I love it. Dark Sakura. Thanks for
11371040	11378480	strolling in late tonight. We appreciate it. If you don't like it, Dark Sakura,
11378480	11385600	your final thoughts tonight. Horseradish is still burning. Thank you guys so much for

11414240	11419920	my goal is to have this show be like an Epic four hour show. Just me talking to listeners,
11419920	11426160	me talking to developers, me talking to you at PAX East. So remember what word has been repeated
11426160	11434480	the most? Me, me, me, me, me, me, the me show. Yay. No, it's the Rob show. It's starring him.
11435120	11440080	No, it's the gamers having a voice show and I'm just the person that helps them get their voices
11440080	11447360	out. It's the Rob show. Hey, look, you could come to packs too. If I could sneak you in my suitcase.
11448800	11453360	I'm so freaking broke, but you'll have to, uh, you'll have to say for packs prime in August
11453360	11457360	labor day weekend, right? Cause I'm trying to get Alan to go to packs prime. Alan wants to go to
11457360	11462400	packs prime. Yes. I want someone to pay for me to go cause I'm broke. And E3 I got E3 on the
11462400	11468640	horizon too. I can't, I can't afford to go to Disneyland. Oh no. Unless I have a full paid way
11468640	11474320	there. That's going to be rough. That's Disneyland ain't cheap. I know. All right. You guys are
11474320	11479040	invited to my birthday party that we can do. You have, you know what you do have your birthday
11479040	11484640	party with Disney decorations. My birthday. If you want, we'll get a little teacup. I'll spin
11484640	11490000	you around. My birthday party is going to be a beer pot luck. Everybody brings different types
11490000	11494560	of beer as long as it's good. It's a great idea. All right. That's it. We're out of here. It's
11494560	11499200	been an Epic show tonight. Thank you all for being a part of it and making it happen. You have
