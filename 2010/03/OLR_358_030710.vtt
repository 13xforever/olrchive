WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
The following program is intended for mature audiences.

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

00:10.000 --> 00:16.000
Here's your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Lowkey.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
Tonight, March 7th, 2010, we get first impressions on Final Fantasy XIII.

00:22.000 --> 00:31.000
One of our favorite games is patched with teasers of a sequel, and the Rock Band Network goes live.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
I come bearing a message from President Catt.

00:50.000 --> 00:57.000
Here in California, home of Silicon Valley, home of video games, we are in a budget crisis.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
State employees are furloughed, meaning we can't go to the DMV most Fridays.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
Students are protesting out on the freeways amidst high tuition cutbacks.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
Yet somehow, our legislatures found the time last week to pass a resolution

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
supporting Anti-Cussing Week to take place this very week.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
Residents are encouraged to refrain from cussing and donate swear jar money to charity

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
because swearing bothers some 14-year-old in Southern California.

01:26.000 --> 01:34.000
Apparently, swearing profusely shows a lack of intelligence or some sort of lack of character.

01:34.000 --> 01:41.000
However, substituting words like opicles and sassafras, which have all of the same intent,

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
is somehow okay and makes you a smarter person.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
As residents of the state of California, we reject this notion.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
As intelligent individuals, we take offense to the notion

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
that using versatile swear words somehow demonstrates a lack of intelligence.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
As free citizens of the United States of America living under the First Amendment,

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
we say, fuck yeah, to free speech.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
We will work tonight in protest of No Cussing Week

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
to break the record for most uses of the F-word on an internet podcast.

02:13.000 --> 02:21.000
Tonight, on a very special Orange Lounge radio, we bring you The Fuck Show.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
Welcome to another fucking week of Orange Lounge fucking radio.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
My name is Rob, Fucking Roberts, here with you every week as always.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
Say hello to the one and only fucking wonderful Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Well, fuckity fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
How the fuck are you tonight, young lady?

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Fucking rad. And pissed off.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Why are you so fucking pissed off tonight?

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Because people just annoy the fuck out of me.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
Why? What did they do? What ruffled your fucking feathers this week?

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
I'm just fucking annoyed at people feeling like they have to defend their own fucking opinion

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
every fucking time someone says something that's different from them. So fuck them.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Not really fuck them, but just fuck in general.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
I know, just fuck them. Right in their fucking ears.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
Hey, say hello to the one and only, he is so fucking smart, tech master, Loki.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
I keep fucking coughing. I wish this fucking gold go away.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
You have been fucking sick for like 30 fucking weeks now.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
I haven't been coughing all day long, but then all of a sudden this fucking coughing started after I ate all of my chicken.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Would you like some tea?

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
No, I really hate fucking tea. Tea is awful.

03:36.000 --> 03:43.000
No, I think it's the root beer. And while delicious the root beer was, it makes me cough. And that's not good.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Are you allergic to fucking root beer?

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
No, I am not allergic to root beer. Root beer is awesome.

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
It's just, you know, the carbonation or whatever kind of loosens the fucking phlegm in my throat.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
So, it sucks. But yeah, otherwise I'm fine. I'm fucking great.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Alright, glad to hear it.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
Alright, well folks, we do have some gaming news to get into a little later.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
But first, we always fucking start off the show talking about our fucking gaming weeks.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Like, anybody really gives a fuck what we've been playing.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
But that's just how you do a video game podcast.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
We've been doing it a very fucking long time, about eight years.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
So, we used to start with a little segment called How Was Your Day? How Was Your Week?

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
But no one really gave a shit. So, we evolved it to fucking video games.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
So, how the fuck was your gaming week, DarkSakura?

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
It was fucking boring.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
I played Star Trek Online and made it to Lieutenant Commander. Finally, fuck yeah.

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
And got this weird Klingon chick and a Bajoran dude, but fuck him.

04:36.000 --> 04:42.000
And that's about all. I didn't do fuck all.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
Alright. It's more fucking Star Trek Online, same fucking story every fucking week.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
But that's alright. That's what it's like to be fucking addicted to an MMO. I should know.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
I'm not addicted. Fuck you.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
Okay, sorry. Maybe not fucking addicted, but fucking...

04:56.000 --> 05:03.000
I set a day. A day that is my fuck off day. Where I do fuck all.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
But play my damn game and fuck around on the internet.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
I think it's good to have a fuck off day. I have fuck off days on days ending in one.

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
I have actually started a project. A fantastic fucking project.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
That does not involve fucking, by the way.

05:17.000 --> 05:29.000
Called Project Real Life. Where this thing, this evil box, this fucking whore of a computer gets turned off.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
How the fuck are you able to function?

05:31.000 --> 05:37.000
But you're fucking playing the game in real life. So I don't understand what the fucking point is.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
I'm paying attention to my own fucking real life.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
Well fuck me then. No thank you.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
Alright. Loki, how the fuck was your gaming week?

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
Well let's talk about how awesome my gaming week was.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
No wait, let's talk about how awful today was. Today was a fucking mess.

05:55.000 --> 06:01.000
You see, I have a fucking 360. Well, many fucking 360s.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
One of which was apparently going to be modded or J-tagged, if you will.

06:06.000 --> 06:13.000
And so I found some guy on Craigslist, which right there should have sent out some fucking signs.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
That would be willing to do it for me. So we arranged to meet this morning.

06:18.000 --> 06:24.000
So I drove a fucking hour and fifteen minutes down the Stockton, the butthole of the Sacramento County.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
Well actually it's San Joaquin County. Still butthole of the county.

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
And so we went down there, and mind you...

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
Actually, just to quantify. In the fucking state of California, you have fucking Fresno.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
Which I think is generally accepted as kind of like the asshole of the state of California.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
No fucking offense to those that live there. Stockton would kind of be...

06:45.000 --> 06:52.000
It's kind of like between the asshole and the balls. So Stockton is kind of the fucking taint of California.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
And there's nothing on the way.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
And it's not pleasurable.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
It's just cow country. Fucking shitty smelling cow country.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
Anyways, so I decided... Okay, mind you, I woke up at 730 this morning.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
That's fucking early on a Sunday.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
I drove all the way down there. Met the guy just before 9.

07:11.000 --> 07:19.000
Gave him my console. Paid him the $60 it would be, you know, to solder in the chip that I wanted him to solder in.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
Told me it would take about, you know, fucking 30 to 45 minutes.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
Four hours later, waiting in fucking Stockton.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
The guy's not returning any of my text messages. He's not returning any of my phone calls.

07:32.000 --> 07:37.000
And so I'm fucking sitting there going, okay, well, I guess I'm either going to fucking sit here all day,

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
or I'm going to have to fucking leave and leave my console behind and assume that I'm getting ripped off.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
So that's what happened. I got fucking ripped off apparently.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Well, fuck him.

07:46.000 --> 07:53.000
Yes, fuck him indeed. And so I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt for now.

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
And assume that this really was a mistake and his phone is all fucked up or whatever.

07:58.000 --> 08:06.000
And so I will be polite and contact him by email, you know, giving him the opportunity to, you know, fucking ship me my console.

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
However, if he doesn't do that, then I'm fucking posting his phone number and posting his email.

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
Hey, don't forget. Send me his IP. I will find his fucking address.

08:16.000 --> 08:22.000
We can go show up at his house and say, fuck you. Give it back.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
So, anyways, and then Final Fantasy 13.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
This is not the C-word show. Fuck you.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
And then Final Fantasy 13. That's, you know, basically been my gaming week.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
By the way, Dark Soccer is just fucking openly swearing randomly at our fucking chat room.

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to join all the fucking action tonight in our chat room.

08:41.000 --> 08:47.000
Yes, three hours of this tonight, ladies and fucking gentlemen. It could be this or the Oscars, I mean, honestly.

08:47.000 --> 08:53.000
And remember, keep track of how many fucks get fucking said so that we can fucking send it to fucking Guinness and fucking Ireland.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Hey, stop trying to run up the counter artificially.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
That's not artificial.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Fucking stop it.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
I'm legitimately saying fuck, and I can say fuck as much as I fucking want to, Rob, so fuck you.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Oh, in a good way.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Loki, any more in your fucking gaming room?

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Rob, I fucking love you.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
I fucking love you too, bitch.

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
I also played some more of, oh, what the fuck, Borderlands.

09:16.000 --> 09:22.000
I played more of Borderlands because I'm trying to get the game finished before I can, you know, fucking start the new expansion.

09:22.000 --> 09:29.000
And I'm liking it still, and I just have to level up my characters.

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
Actually, I have to level up my friend's character because he's fucking 18 levels below me.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
So, yeah, so I played a little bit more of that.

09:38.000 --> 09:45.000
And of course, Grand Theft Auto, you know, fucking, what, ranked like 74 now in the true skill ranks.

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
And then I'm still fucking like 195 in the regular ranks just because I don't play on the weekends.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
And it's, you know, kind of bounces around during the week, so.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
But true skill's really where I'm, you know, trying to get to the top of the fucking list.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
And doing pretty good. So, that's it.

10:00.000 --> 10:06.000
You notice how our chat room has been increasing exponentially?

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Oh, and fuck deft? Cunt.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
I said it. I hate that word, and I said it, so whatever.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
I'm looking at the chat, and all these fucking people are in there tonight.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
We love you all, by the way. We fucking love you and your support so much.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
But we have Hardcore77777. That's a lot of fucking sevens.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
And his name there says, oh wow, I picked a bad night to listen.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Yes, you fucking picked a bad night.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Welcome to your first fucking live show. Congratulations.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
How was that?

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Isn't any week a fucking bad night to listen?

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Who was that?

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
Hardcore77777777. Seven. Seven.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
And a fucking GP says, fucking GTA again? Fuck Loki, fuck.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
Hey, I believe that every fucking day. Twice fucking day.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
Actually, sometimes three fucking times a day.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
And I fuck everyone up in it, because I'm so fucking awesome.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
So, I have to. I have to mention it every week.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
It's what I'm proud of.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
In fact, and we'll get into this a little bit fucking later,

11:03.000 --> 11:09.000
but remember how they updated some TOS stuff for Xbox Live?

11:09.000 --> 11:18.000
And now I can post my Ballad of Gay Tony ranks in there without, you know, the word gay being, you know, fucking banning me.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
Ah, well congratulations I suppose. There's a good reason.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
That whole policy was kind of fucked anyway. It was overcompensating.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Is that a story later we're going to get into?

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
I should probably shut my fucking mouth then.

11:29.000 --> 11:34.000
Anything else you want to talk about during your fucking gaming week?

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
Just Final Fantasy's awesome.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
Alright, my fucking gaming week. I've been playing a lot of fucking WoW as usual.

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
My character's probably to about fucking level 53 I think I finally fucking dinged this week.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Fucking addict.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Shut the fuck up.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Bite my fucking ass.

11:53.000 --> 11:58.000
My boyfriend though, he got to level fucking 55, so he can roll a fucking Death Knight now whenever the fuck he wants.

11:58.000 --> 12:03.000
But we might do like the twin Death Knight thing like fucking later, but I don't know.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
Like right now the fucking focus is getting his fucking character to 80.

12:06.000 --> 12:11.000
But the problem is I found another game that's going to fucking sink all my time for the next two weeks, which I'll get into in a minute.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
But I wanted to talk about a couple of other fucking games real quick.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
One of them is Critter Crunch. It's so fucking cute.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
And I finally played the full version of the game. I played the fucking demo before.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
It's fucking cute. It's a lot like Magical Drop. Did you ever fucking play that?

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
Yeah, I played that. I didn't really care for it too much, but...

12:28.000 --> 12:34.000
Imagine if Magical Drop wasn't about matching the fucking colors, but it was about putting things in a fucking sequence.

12:34.000 --> 12:40.000
Like instead of like fucking all the blues disappear, it's like you got to go fucking green, red, and blue in an order or whatever.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
That sounds too fucking complicated.

12:41.000 --> 12:47.000
No, it's not that fucking bad because it's little bugs, fucking medium-sized bugs, and then big bugs.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
And it's pretty intuitive to figure out. It's not that fucking hard.

12:51.000 --> 12:59.000
And there's these weird elements too where you fucking barf rainbows into little critters' mouths and all these like overly cute fucking things.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
Well, no wonder you fucking like it. Barfing rainbows.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Shut up. It's fucking cute. Shut up.

13:04.000 --> 13:12.000
And there's lots of modes in it. I wish I'd bought the fucking game when it was on sale, but it's okay because it's on Alan's PlayStation 3 so I can play it whenever the fuck I'm over there.

13:12.000 --> 13:18.000
But it was really cute. I played through a good probably 15 stages while I was there and got some trophies.

13:18.000 --> 13:24.000
It's cute. I think it's a fucking good deal and if I wasn't so busy playing something else right now, I might fucking buy the full version.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Who wants some fucking tequila?

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
You have fucking tequila?

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
You bought it.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
If I didn't have to fucking drive home, I would.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
We can do a shot now.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
As if my swearing wasn't bad enough right now.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
Well, fuck it. It's a night just to fuck it. Do you want some tequila?

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
I don't want any tequila.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
I better pass. I better pass. Thank you though.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Fine. I'll drink my beer by myself.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
You fucking drink yourself into a coma.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Alright, let's see.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
I play Misty too.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Why is that?

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Just tell me about fucking beer.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
Um, let's see. What the fuck else is I playing?

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
Oh, Final Fantasy II on the fucking iPhone.

13:56.000 --> 14:01.000
You kinda know what you're in for if you're gonna download a Final Fantasy game onto the fucking iPhone.

14:01.000 --> 14:07.000
Because the iPhone, although it is a gaming platform, it's kind of a fucking terrible one because there's no fucking controller.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
And that's the worst part about Final Fantasy II.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
I will say this. The game fucking looks great.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
It's fucking gorgeous. It's one of the best fucking looking games on the iPhone.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
It's a port of the fucking PSP one.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
It is. It's a fucking port of the PSP one, almost like tit for tat.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
But, they have made some fucking adjustments to it to make it more touch friendly.

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
For instance, when you're in a battle, you have all these little fucking icons instead of the words to attack.

14:29.000 --> 14:36.000
And even when you're in the menus to cast fucking magic, there's these little fucking icons that show up that you use to cast your fucking spells and shit.

14:36.000 --> 14:42.000
And, you know, if you want to cast your spell on all the fucking enemies, you drag your finger to select all the enemies.

14:42.000 --> 14:47.000
You can't unfortunately just fucking sit there and hammer the A button to get through all the fucking battles.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
You know, you kind of have to tap tap tap tap, so everything's a little bit fucking slower.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
That's not the annoying part. I don't fucking mind that as much as I do.

14:54.000 --> 15:01.000
When you're in the fucking towns, and you're having to use the fucking fake D-pad on the touchscreen and the fucking button to run,

15:01.000 --> 15:06.000
And you're trying to talk to fucking townspeople, because the framerate is so fucking bad.

15:06.000 --> 15:11.000
And everything is so fucking jumpy that you literally have to chase all the fucking townspeople around for a fucking minute just to fucking talk to them.

15:11.000 --> 15:16.840
to them which shouldn't be that fucking hard in a Final Fantasy game well they

15:16.840 --> 15:21.280
don't fucking tell you that before you buy it so you won't know until you buy

15:21.280 --> 15:24.540
it but I will say this nine dollars is a pretty fucking good price for Final

15:24.540 --> 15:28.880
Fantasy 2 again I bought Final Fantasy 2 because I played the original fucking

15:28.880 --> 15:32.840
Final Fantasy a ton of times so whatever but the Final Fantasy fucking 2 I only

15:32.840 --> 15:36.440
played once on the PSP so I decided what the fuck I'll buy this just to kind of

15:36.440 --> 15:39.720
check it out it's only nine dollars I will say this if you have a fucking PSP

15:39.720 --> 15:45.000
just spend the extra ten dollars to get a copy of the Final Fantasy yeah you

15:45.000 --> 15:49.800
could probably fucking find it used somewhere for cheaper so yeah if you're

15:49.800 --> 15:54.920
gonna pay nine dollars for the fucking iPhone version did I say nukin is that a

15:54.920 --> 16:03.680
nukin nukin but it's fuck inga yeah thank you I know um if you're gonna

16:03.680 --> 16:06.980
spend half as much to get the iPhone version then you fucking get what you

16:06.980 --> 16:09.520
fucking pay for that's all I have to say when it comes to controls this kind of

16:09.520 --> 16:15.200
weak sauce but it is a beautiful game and you know with being able to save

16:15.200 --> 16:20.200
anywhere the fuck you want to it's a good game to just pass the time if

16:20.200 --> 16:23.320
you're you know on the fucking potty or sitting at the fucking doctor's office

16:23.320 --> 16:26.600
waiting for something it's it'll take you probably a year to fucking beat that

16:26.600 --> 16:34.880
way but you can fucking do it so there you go um let's see other fucking gaming

16:34.880 --> 16:38.200
news this week okay I'll tell you a game that's been taking a lot of my fucking

16:38.200 --> 16:44.040
time Final Fantasy 13 I've sunk about five and a half hours into it so let me

16:44.040 --> 16:46.680
give you my first impressions and I'm gonna step away from the f-word thing

16:46.680 --> 16:49.880
for a minute because I I know a lot of people are really anticipating this game

16:49.880 --> 16:53.560
so I want to talk seriously about this for a minute so Final Fantasy 13 is

16:53.560 --> 16:57.280
obviously on its way out on Tuesday and we got a copy through legitimate

16:57.280 --> 17:00.520
purposes don't you worry it's it's totally legit and all that stuff just a

17:00.520 --> 17:03.240
few days early just so we could jump in there and have something to say about it

17:03.240 --> 17:08.680
today it played through the game and you know I've read a lot of the reviews are

17:08.680 --> 17:13.000
online just like a lot of you guys have about how the game is is really fucking

17:13.000 --> 17:16.720
linear and you know it's kind of just an interactive movie where you're just

17:16.720 --> 17:21.920
fucking bashing the X button for a long time and I kind of go well Final Fantasy

17:21.920 --> 17:27.400
7 I see a lot of comparisons from 13 to 7 at least in the bits that I've played

17:27.400 --> 17:31.640
so far you might remember in Final Fantasy 7 you started that game and you

17:31.640 --> 17:35.920
were in Midgar and you were trapped there you know I shouldn't say trapped

17:35.920 --> 17:38.760
it makes it sound like you couldn't do anything but you were playing a somewhat

17:38.760 --> 17:42.920
linear story for about the first seven hours of Final Fantasy 7 until you

17:42.920 --> 17:46.080
depending on you know how fast or slower you are you tell you get out of Midgar

17:46.080 --> 17:49.960
and explore the overworld now I know an overworld well I don't I don't really

17:49.960 --> 17:53.120
know what I haven't read spoilers on 13 and I don't want to know so chat stay

17:53.120 --> 17:55.840
quiet I don't know if there's an overworld that shows up but I already

17:55.840 --> 17:59.160
know there's no towns so I imagine it's gonna stay kind of very well they have

17:59.160 --> 18:03.960
took over writing they have in the manual so obviously okay so so there's

18:03.960 --> 18:07.280
gonna be some type of overworld later that's gonna be similar to seven in fact

18:07.280 --> 18:11.440
honestly guys this game has a lot in common with seven there's a lot of the

18:11.440 --> 18:16.080
same types of characters like lightning and cloud have a lot in common except

18:16.080 --> 18:20.920
one's got a vagina there's you know the emo kid that you just want to slap

18:20.920 --> 18:24.720
across the face there's your sassy black man that's there for comic relief I mean

18:24.720 --> 18:30.320
there's a lot of similarities and but that isn't a bad thing I mean Final Fantasy

18:30.320 --> 18:34.600
7 was a really good game it got overblown a little bit by the fucking

18:34.600 --> 18:43.560
crazy-ass fans out there but it's it was still a good game 13 is kind of linear

18:43.560 --> 18:47.080
in the beginning because you're running down a railroad track so yeah there's

18:47.080 --> 18:49.740
not a lot of fucking places to go because you're supposed to be running in

18:49.740 --> 18:53.100
a fucking straight line but I kind of consider that part of the very slow

18:53.100 --> 18:56.080
learning curve of this game and I think that's what's gonna make or break people

18:56.080 --> 19:00.780
consider that you don't learn about paradigm shifts which is this huge

19:00.780 --> 19:04.440
fucking change to the battle system until you're three hours into the game

19:04.440 --> 19:12.320
is that like x2 or 10 to um I think that's a lot of I mean Lost Odyssey kind

19:12.320 --> 19:17.440
of had some of that too a lot of these are so it does remind me a lot of Lost

19:17.440 --> 19:22.680
Odyssey actually mm-hmm but Lost Odyssey was more like you know Final Fantasy but

19:22.680 --> 19:25.800
when I say it takes three hours to get there I don't want you thinking you're

19:25.800 --> 19:29.160
just fucking bored for three hours just sitting there jerking off doing nothing

19:29.160 --> 19:33.360
I kind of find this game to be like a like a banana or something that slowly

19:33.360 --> 19:38.680
peels and slowly unfold it's our show its true shape and like if you don't I

19:38.680 --> 19:42.420
don't know if you read any of the manual or anything like before you started like

19:42.420 --> 19:47.280
like falsie and lost you know let's see and stuff like that I was like what the

19:47.280 --> 19:53.520
fuck are they talking about turn subtitles on interjection just a fucking

19:53.520 --> 19:56.840
interject I'm currently not listening to this because I haven't played it yet and

19:56.840 --> 20:00.800
I'm trying to keep the spoiler for I'm not gonna get story but I'm and I want

20:00.800 --> 20:04.600
to be completely surprised so I'm I will give little spoilers about the battle

20:04.600 --> 20:08.920
system I am zoning the fuck out okay fucking zone out all you want sorry

20:08.920 --> 20:13.440
lucky what we say no it is confusing and I do have the subtitles and stuff turned

20:13.440 --> 20:17.040
on because you know I don't want to in the my audio whatever cuz I have the

20:17.040 --> 20:22.520
five-one headphones or whatever it's very digital sounding it's like a lot of

20:22.520 --> 20:26.660
like it's too loud almost like you're like I'm listening to it and at a

20:26.660 --> 20:30.120
drive-in theater through one of those really shitty speakers is what it sounds

20:30.120 --> 20:33.160
like well here's the thing they're talking to a lot of it starts to make

20:33.160 --> 20:36.760
more sense as it goes on the way the storytelling is in this game again I'm

20:36.760 --> 20:40.660
not gonna spoil the story itself but the way the storytelling is I draw a lot of

20:40.660 --> 20:45.540
comparisons to the TV show lost or you kind of find things out slowly but

20:45.540 --> 20:50.240
surely and then a lot is explained through flashbacks like the very opening

20:50.240 --> 20:53.940
sequence of the game you're like oh this is just like Final Fantasy 7 people on a

20:53.940 --> 20:58.120
fucking train all over again right but you find out the motivations and while

20:58.120 --> 21:02.520
that happens through flashbacks that occur in the story so there's a lot of

21:02.520 --> 21:05.800
similarities I think between like watching lost on TV but you know how

21:05.800 --> 21:09.800
lost kind of divides people like some people are like I this this shows too

21:09.800 --> 21:12.760
fucking slow for me they need to get to the fucking point already that's gonna

21:12.760 --> 21:16.000
be what makes or breaks people if I'm has he 13 I think as well is that if

21:16.000 --> 21:18.400
you're not willing to make that investment and kind of approach this is

21:18.400 --> 21:22.800
like a miniseries or kind of you know something like lost like I don't see how

21:22.800 --> 21:26.280
you could like a show like lost and then hate the way the story is in this game

21:26.280 --> 21:30.760
because it takes fucking forever for things to happen in lost and it takes a

21:30.760 --> 21:33.760
little while for things to happen in this game it's it's kind of the same I

21:33.760 --> 21:39.080
want to speak really quickly about the battle system real quick okay Final

21:39.080 --> 21:43.120
Fantasy and introduces this new thing called paradigm shifts and the easiest

21:43.120 --> 21:46.260
fucking way I could explain it is that imagine you could flip your character

21:46.260 --> 21:49.960
from a black white mage to a white mage right in the middle of battle that's

21:49.960 --> 21:53.520
what the paradigm shifts are all about and it's a lot cooler than I think I'm

21:53.520 --> 21:56.160
making it sound because like you know you might be doing a battle and you're

21:56.160 --> 21:59.320
trying to chain things to get the monster to kind of slip into this mode

21:59.320 --> 22:02.280
where it's easier to hit it and then all of a sudden you're like oh shit I'm low

22:02.280 --> 22:06.720
on HP I better paradigm shift so I suddenly get a medic in my party and

22:06.720 --> 22:10.080
also maybe somebody that casts barrier and all that shit to protect people and

22:10.080 --> 22:13.640
then once everybody's cured up go back to assault yeah because you're really

22:13.640 --> 22:17.040
fucking off you're really only controlling the first character in the

22:17.040 --> 22:20.840
in each party so you're only controlling the party leader at the rest of them

22:20.840 --> 22:25.800
you're kind of having to give like different jobs to and they basically do

22:25.800 --> 22:30.280
it um going to our chat room at chat orange lounge radio.com Bo fuck you

22:30.280 --> 22:36.160
which kawa says so it's fucking x2 it's a lot more fluid than x2 you know x2 had

22:36.160 --> 22:40.240
those big big big animations with the dresh fears and everything it's a lot

22:40.240 --> 22:44.000
quicker than that it's not so over the top like it was in x2 it feels a lot

22:44.000 --> 22:47.520
more fluid I'm gonna say the battle system in 13 to me feels a little bit

22:47.520 --> 22:51.960
more like an action game it takes active time battle to the next level it is like

22:51.960 --> 22:56.320
fast paced it is very fucking and ever like you know much like the other final

22:56.320 --> 23:00.560
fantasy games you know to get a preemptive strike or whatever is kind of

23:00.560 --> 23:04.800
random whereas this you actually can sneak up on enemies because they have

23:04.800 --> 23:09.680
like their own you know visual arc that they have their line of sight or

23:09.680 --> 23:13.800
whatever and you can if you sneak up around them you can actually you know do

23:13.800 --> 23:16.920
preemptive strikes that way and it works a little bit different to where you

23:16.920 --> 23:21.040
don't necessarily do damage to them but it jumps that combo up so that you can

23:21.040 --> 23:25.440
do more damage to them later on good good question really fucking great

23:25.440 --> 23:29.520
question from yyr in chat says so does this mean you don't have to use any

23:29.520 --> 23:33.760
strategy when choosing your party because you can swap at any time so far

23:33.760 --> 23:36.780
and again granted I'm only five and a half hours in right now for those that

23:36.780 --> 23:40.360
are playing the game I'm in a place called thing it's called the valley of

23:40.360 --> 23:43.420
ruin is what it's called oh that's all I say I don't want to spoil stories or

23:43.420 --> 23:48.440
whatever you don't have control over who's in your party people switch in and

23:48.440 --> 23:53.840
out based on the story in fact there's a lot of these people are over here and

23:53.840 --> 23:57.200
these people are over here these people are over here and their paths intersect

23:57.200 --> 24:01.300
once in a while there's a lot of that going on early on in the game so you

24:01.300 --> 24:04.300
don't really have a lot of control over your party. I think later on you'll be

24:04.300 --> 24:07.700
able to control that more and also don't worry the way the XP works is very

24:07.700 --> 24:10.980
similar to Ten's experience system where you're kind of moving around the board

24:10.980 --> 24:14.560
spending points and... That was a little confusing too because I was trying to figure out

24:14.560 --> 24:17.220
I was like trying because they're all yeah you pick the direction you want to

24:17.220 --> 24:19.940
go and you hold this button down I'm like I want to go this way and it's

24:19.940 --> 24:23.780
going the opposite direction I'm like no I want to go the other way it's all

24:23.780 --> 24:27.060
right it makes it makes sense later on as you're using it it's very similar to

24:27.060 --> 24:31.180
Ten's all your characters gain points when anyone in your party wins so it's

24:31.180 --> 24:33.780
not like you're gonna have these obscenely under leveled characters

24:33.780 --> 24:37.700
there are no levels for the characters there's there's no levels

24:37.700 --> 24:42.020
there's no XP there's a but there you have kind of the Ten's system instead is

24:42.020 --> 24:46.660
what you have in place of that there's no magic points which is a huge shift

24:46.660 --> 24:51.620
there's something else they use instead of magic points but your characters are

24:51.620 --> 24:56.180
gonna be flinging fire and arrow left and right with no consequence you have

24:56.180 --> 25:00.660
to really think about that and there is um what else do I want to say there's no

25:00.660 --> 25:06.020
magic and there's no oh and after every battle you're cured to full you don't

25:06.020 --> 25:11.660
have to cure your party after battle you start heal everybody yeah it's a lot of

25:11.660 --> 25:16.020
changes some people are not gonna like it but I say give it a chance I think

25:16.020 --> 25:19.780
it's a lot of fucking fun and I'm five and a half hours in I am hooked hooked

25:19.780 --> 25:24.540
hooked hooked I want to you guys know I have fucking gamer a DD really fucking

25:24.540 --> 25:28.180
bad I'm always like ooh shiny I want to go play this fucking blur beta or I'm

25:28.180 --> 25:31.340
gonna go play game room or something I will see this game out to completion I

25:31.340 --> 25:37.540
will I know I will I think the story is actually pretty good yeah I like it but

25:37.540 --> 25:44.140
if you really really hated the characters in seven you might hate these

25:44.140 --> 25:49.100
guys too so just a word of caution because I see a lot of similarities and

25:49.100 --> 25:53.780
I don't want to fall down the path of like the really nerdy you know gamer

25:53.780 --> 25:58.380
that's you know virgin in his you know basement that's and stuff because we

25:58.380 --> 26:02.700
know that's not really the truth of me fuck those stereotypes but here's what

26:02.700 --> 26:09.420
I'm saying dude and I feel really wrong saying this but Vanille it's fucking hot

26:09.420 --> 26:16.420
like it's like what the fuck 15 that is gross fucking pedophiles dream it's

26:16.420 --> 26:20.940
seriously it's like it's like oh not to spoil anything where'd you get your

26:20.940 --> 26:27.260
seal oh it's right here my upper thigh like oh come on yeah that was Alan and I

26:27.260 --> 26:31.020
were both like just had that big reaction of oh I feel dirty oh oh god

26:31.020 --> 26:37.100
that was dirty oh god what's up with her voice actor or actress I should say it's

26:37.100 --> 26:44.300
just like got an accent and she's I don't even know what's wrong but it's

26:44.300 --> 26:48.140
weird it's just seriously weird it's like oh the one thing and I'll wrap this

26:48.140 --> 26:50.980
up because I know Jamie's like I want to talk about something else I was doing my

26:50.980 --> 26:54.340
fucking laundry okay but well I just want to say this really quick one thing

26:54.340 --> 26:58.020
that just blew me the fuck away when I was playing this game like seriously

26:58.020 --> 27:01.700
it's the little things that count well two things a when you fucking load your

27:01.700 --> 27:06.220
game after having taken an hour break or something you get a fucking explanation

27:06.220 --> 27:09.300
of where you're at in the story so you can remember where the fuck you left off

27:09.300 --> 27:14.060
which is great like just it's a lip it's little things that count also blew me

27:14.060 --> 27:20.980
the fuck away you ready the lips are in sync with the English dialogue that's

27:20.980 --> 27:26.180
right that it is not a really bad dub they did that with 10-2 though did they

27:26.180 --> 27:29.940
I didn't play enough of 10-2 I watched some people also didn't really get in

27:29.940 --> 27:34.880
mind that the ending cinemas actually a lot of the cinemas were re-synced to

27:34.880 --> 27:40.060
also fit the English dialogue and the end sequence the little song that unit

27:40.060 --> 27:44.620
gets up and sing was completely reanimated I was fucking blown away by

27:44.620 --> 27:47.860
the like it's those little things that just made me go whoa and by the way

27:47.860 --> 27:52.580
since it hasn't really been mentioned yet the game is fucking gorgeous it is a

27:52.580 --> 27:56.840
beautiful beautiful game and I know I've seen those reports others say no the

27:56.840 --> 28:02.820
360 version looks worse than the ps3 who cares play the fucking game I don't care

28:02.820 --> 28:06.820
what system you get it on that we're getting the ps3 one and that's what I

28:06.820 --> 28:12.620
got to but I was just I just knew the 360 was a port and I you know what I

28:12.620 --> 28:19.460
just I wanted my achievement points did you go 360 yes I did I went 360 okay I

28:19.460 --> 28:23.860
have is no no biggie as three discs and you know what though I mean honestly how

28:23.860 --> 28:28.340
often am I gonna be shifting new discs around what whenever I get to that point

28:28.340 --> 28:33.740
oh my god I have to put another disc in the machine I feel so old you'll be

28:33.740 --> 28:38.300
amazed at how fucking much they probably squeezed onto one disc it it's just it's

28:38.300 --> 28:44.700
a beautiful game it is so like I just blown away by some of the visuals and

28:44.700 --> 28:48.580
like it's not all just like the industrial looks that you've seen in

28:48.580 --> 28:52.220

32:06.260 --> 32:09.940
fucking okay I have heard I have heard from someone who is a very big stickler

32:09.940 --> 32:13.660
for Alice in Wonderland who said that she loved it no I was pissed the fuck

32:13.660 --> 32:17.180
off though that they didn't have the Tron 2 trailer before it because we

32:17.180 --> 32:21.420
didn't see the fucking 3d version well the 3d version was just not playing at

32:21.420 --> 32:24.660
the right time and it's more expensive and I honestly don't think the fucking

32:24.660 --> 32:28.460
3d was that good and you know Alice in Wonderland just based well you know what

32:28.460 --> 32:31.980
I saw in the trailer by the way I neglected some of our chatters are

32:31.980 --> 32:34.340
really fucking confused right now that we're suddenly talking about playing

32:34.340 --> 32:38.780
the pink anus let me give some fucking background to that you first off listen

32:38.780 --> 32:41.300
to last week's show it's all fucking explained there but there's a game on

32:41.300 --> 32:45.580
Steam called what what the fuck is it secrets of the magic crystal and it's a

32:45.580 --> 32:49.380
game that looks like you're breeding unicorns or some fucking bullshit but

32:49.380 --> 32:52.780
one of the items that you're using if you look at the various screenshots one

32:52.780 --> 32:56.260
of the items you use in your fucking horse breeding has these little pink

32:56.260 --> 33:01.660
bars and they're called anus a en us so we officially have fucking called this

33:01.660 --> 33:07.820
the pink anus game because it's funny and you get to say anus and you're not

33:07.820 --> 33:12.620
being vulgar you're just talking about what's in a video game so there you

33:12.620 --> 33:16.900
fucking go there's some explanation on what's going on all right um let's see

33:16.900 --> 33:19.980
what other fucking housekeeping do I have fucking why aren't you fucking

33:19.980 --> 33:24.340
following us on Twitter and Facebook and all that stuff twitter.com slash olr

33:24.340 --> 33:27.300
we'll take your fucking Twitter questions later you know because it is

33:27.300 --> 33:31.980
the show where every fucking gamer has a voice even when that voice is very vulgar

33:31.980 --> 33:36.020
we also have our Facebook at orange lounge radio we have a myspace too but I

33:36.020 --> 33:38.380
haven't logged in there for like fucking three months but I guess I should check

33:38.380 --> 33:42.660
on that yeah I really should just go to the fucking website orange lounge radio

33:42.660 --> 33:46.940
com it's great we got you know these two guys chase VX Jason XV and deep man

33:46.940 --> 33:49.620
worked very fucking hard on the website by the way deep man speaking of the

33:49.620 --> 33:53.820
website I need to fucking say this real quick fucking deep man posted a fucking

33:53.820 --> 33:57.900
great little exposition on a game I don't know a fucking lot about but it's

33:57.900 --> 34:01.420
Yakuza 3 I haven't really been fucking following this very closely because I

34:01.420 --> 34:04.460
didn't really play Yakuza 1 or Yakuza 2 but I still found deep man's article

34:04.460 --> 34:07.580
very fucking interesting because Sega made all these fucking localization

34:07.580 --> 34:11.420
changes to Yakuza 3 that have people pissed off and I think deep man does a

34:11.420 --> 34:14.500
very fucking good job of running it down and I'm also just kind of fucking

34:14.500 --> 34:17.540
appreciative that there's like actual content on our website besides just the

34:17.540 --> 34:22.860

exactly well I know we get new listeners every week so I haven't fucking updated

35:25.340 --> 35:32.020
that in a long time. I'm very sorry by the way if we have new listeners tonight I know this is not

35:32.020 --> 35:35.860
normal if this is your first fucking show you need to realize tonight is a

35:35.860 --> 35:41.420
fucking protest we are exercising our first fucking amendment fucking rights

35:41.420 --> 35:45.660
congratulations if you made it this far and keep in mind normally we are really

35:45.660 --> 35:51.940
Rob will say that he will literally say quote the f-word end quote or f that

35:51.940 --> 35:56.220
and why am I doing quote fingers you can't fucking see what I'm doing um it

35:56.220 --> 36:01.580
makes great fucking radio bite my fucking ass please I said it nicely

36:01.580 --> 36:05.980
please makes it nice please makes it very fucking nice but here's the other

36:05.980 --> 36:09.900
thing to keep in mind is that I bet anything there's gonna be one of those

36:09.900 --> 36:13.660
fucking like podcasts that reviews other podcasts or something or some fucking

36:13.660 --> 36:18.060
asshole on his blogs and say listen the orange lounge radio and all they did was

36:18.060 --> 36:23.300
say fuck cuz they're just stupid and can't think of anything else to say

36:23.300 --> 36:29.620
you other podcasts that seems like again waste again we are protesting the

36:29.620 --> 36:36.180
anti-cussing week that our government has seen fit to waste fucking money and

36:36.180 --> 36:41.260
time voting upon when we are in the middle of what we've hit budget crisis

36:41.260 --> 36:45.780
besides the sides are fucking going out on the freeway and getting like

36:45.780 --> 36:49.460
threatening to get fucking run over by cars in protest of how bad the fees have

36:49.460 --> 36:54.020
gone to universities and I mean I'm a student myself and even going to junior

36:54.020 --> 36:57.380
college right now is fucking expensive and come on look at how bad the fucking

36:57.380 --> 37:01.540
universities are if these students think that that's a good idea running around

37:01.540 --> 37:05.860
on the freeway didn't they fucking learn that and like preschool here's the thing

37:05.860 --> 37:09.740
I think we should have a 60 star loving what I need the ol army and the people

37:09.740 --> 37:13.340
that get it tonight you fucking cool kids that are understanding the show

37:13.340 --> 37:18.380
tonight if you see this shit out there on the internet somewhere fucking tear

37:18.380 --> 37:22.300
them a new asshole because honestly fucking independent people should be

37:22.300 --> 37:25.620
supporting each other not tearing each other down I don't fucking talk bad

37:25.620 --> 37:29.020
about independent podcast open fucking season on those that get paid to do it

37:29.020 --> 37:34.180
in the core podcast though I will I will rip them apart but indie podcasts need

37:34.180 --> 37:38.340
to fucking help each other out and if I may make my own statement about that and

37:38.340 --> 37:42.660
this goes even on an individual basis usually when someone puts down somebody

37:42.660 --> 37:46.100
else without giving any constructive feedback it's because they are having

37:46.100 --> 37:51.820
issues with themselves low fucking self-esteem leads to bitchiness sorry

37:51.820 --> 37:56.580
haven't you noticed that usually the people who are the loudest or certain

37:56.580 --> 38:01.660
people who are um anti-gay I was just fucking that that happened in our

38:01.660 --> 38:07.780
backyard at main national news right huge fucking anti-gay Republican no no

38:07.780 --> 38:11.420
I shouldn't there are some cool Republicans believe it or not it's just

38:11.420 --> 38:13.980
the wrong fucking people are in control of that party right now like Meghan

38:13.980 --> 38:18.460
McCain I'm down with her she is a cool Republican but yeah idiots like this guy

38:18.460 --> 38:23.220
who fucking voted you know yes on a and then fucking has all this legislation

38:23.220 --> 38:27.740
it's fucking anti-gay gets caught at faces a gay bar the Jamie and I have

38:27.740 --> 38:34.380
fucking gone to this place makes gay look straight I've been there coming

38:34.380 --> 38:38.540
back from fucking faces with another guy in his car I mean anyway sorry we need

38:38.540 --> 38:43.820
to go back and do karaoke at faces that would be a lot of fun I actually I

38:43.820 --> 38:50.620
actually though did have another point with this is that you know it's not

38:50.620 --> 38:53.940
really just the budget crisis that haven't we hit what is it somewhere

38:53.940 --> 38:58.660
between 14 and 17 percent statewide unemployment so people there's no fucking

38:58.660 --> 39:02.260
jobs out there yet instead of doing things you know to help people get jobs

39:02.260 --> 39:09.140
to create new programs they're wasting their time and effort on safeguarding

39:09.140 --> 39:15.460
morality which is an individual choice so to our government right now fuck you

39:15.460 --> 39:20.460
in your ear because your ass is not good enough come some quick fucking comments

39:20.460 --> 39:25.140
from chat hardcore 77 once note says both Republicans and Democrats are

39:25.140 --> 39:29.060
corrupt I fucking agree with that honestly because the budget crisis we

39:29.060 --> 39:32.060
have in the state right now it's everybody's fucking fault no I totally

39:32.060 --> 39:34.660
agree you know I think part of the problem I got hate going back to the

39:34.660 --> 39:38.780
political topic sorry it needs to be said it needs to be said the part of the

39:38.780 --> 39:43.780
problem is that we are so stuck in this bipartisan you know system I mean I'm

39:43.780 --> 39:47.980
sure if you ask anybody it's even on public sites to say America has a

39:47.980 --> 39:52.420
two-party system that's a fucking lie we do have independent political parties

39:52.420 --> 39:56.220
it's just the Democrats and the Republicans are the ones with the money

39:56.220 --> 40:01.220
to spend on it and the independence fall to the wayside you know it's the only

40:01.220 --> 40:09.180
that is the reason why I wish that Perot had won I'm saying that is I get for

40:09.180 --> 40:13.460
what for what he fucking stood for I get it I get for what he would do for the

40:13.460 --> 40:18.180
I think morale I'd pick but okay he's the one I would have picked but I'm

40:18.180 --> 40:25.820
saying that as an independent who came to me exactly you know four years vote

40:25.820 --> 40:28.780
him out you know at least you know business won't be fucked up he's a

40:28.780 --> 40:34.540
businessman but I'm saying that I would like to see the wall shattered I'd see

40:34.540 --> 40:38.900
people break out of their little voting strict Republican because oh they're

40:38.900 --> 40:44.180
Republican I want people to this is why I get an absentee balance every ballot

40:44.180 --> 40:49.260
ballot every fucking year because I go through my ballot item by item look up

40:49.260 --> 40:54.060
each of the people in the comfort of my home without having to waste time at the

40:54.060 --> 40:57.500
booth or anything without people breathing down my neck and see who

40:57.500 --> 41:01.660
everyone is and vote for somebody with a well-informed choice so I'm just saying

41:01.660 --> 41:08.460
Oh full ticket okay I got I'm sorry that's okay it's a we fucking say

41:08.460 --> 41:11.220
things that aren't fucking I mean this whole show tonight is not fucking

41:11.220 --> 41:15.100
necessarily about video games but um where was I at also Oh liquid parrot in

41:15.100 --> 41:19.300
chat I had a really fucking good comment what podcast is talking trash about my

41:19.300 --> 41:25.220
beloved olr no one is yet it's just that I'm on Google alerts because I'm fucking

41:25.220 --> 41:27.980
narcissistic right and I want to see everybody who's talking about orange

41:27.980 --> 41:30.940
lounge radio no I don't I don't consider that narcissistic I just consider that

41:30.940 --> 41:33.100
running a good business you want to know what's being said about you on the

41:33.100 --> 41:37.260
internet and sometimes I'll see these fucking blogs from people writing their

41:37.260 --> 41:41.700
individual blogs like podcasts I subscribe to and I unsubscribed from

41:41.700 --> 41:45.700
orange lounge radio this week because I find them very annoying and the girl

41:45.700 --> 41:49.780
talks too much and and the guy is too gay and the other guy is too angry and

41:49.780 --> 41:55.300
blah blah like just shut the fuck up talk about a podcast you do like it

41:55.300 --> 42:00.220
nobody reads your fucking blog because you're so fucking negative that's the

42:00.220 --> 42:05.980
thing anyhow but as far as far as I know the other podcasts are cool if somebody

42:05.980 --> 42:10.980
is talking about us I don't know yet but if I find out it's fucking on all right

42:10.980 --> 42:17.020
anyhow how about 45 minutes in the show and now some fucking gaming news right

42:17.020 --> 42:24.220
Loki all right let's get into this um so there's this bug that fucking popped up

42:24.220 --> 42:28.100
last week we thought it was you know maybe someone hacking the fucking

42:28.100 --> 42:31.900
PlayStation Network or something like that which that still begs the question

42:31.900 --> 42:35.020
what the hell was that web page then that said you know hey turn off your

42:35.020 --> 42:39.940
turn on your fucking Java and your whatever so I don't know what that was

42:39.940 --> 42:45.180
but anyways this was completely unrelated all apparently the most of the

42:45.180 --> 42:50.260
fat PlayStation threes the old style ones had trouble connecting to the

42:50.260 --> 42:56.140
PlayStation Network due to a bug in one of the arm chips and apparently this was

42:56.140 --> 43:01.220
caused by the PlayStation 3 thinking apparently that it was a leap year when

43:01.220 --> 43:06.980
it wasn't and it became unsinked and so because of this you know date time you

43:06.980 --> 43:12.180
know desynchronization it was unable to connect to the PlayStation Network as a

43:12.180 --> 43:18.740
like a precaution the safety precaution or something anyways within you know a

43:18.740 --> 43:23.260
little amount of time it was actually fixed basically the only advice they

43:23.260 --> 43:27.340
fucking gave was don't turn your system on because you know you may lose your

43:27.340 --> 43:32.100
trophies and you know you're some games you may not work in blah blah blah my

43:32.100 --> 43:36.380
favorite was how when it was all fucking over they were like we fucking fixed it

43:36.380 --> 43:39.260
it's okay to turn on your fucking PlayStations now and they didn't do a

43:39.260 --> 43:43.880
goddamn thing they just waited it out that's all they did they didn't fucking

43:43.880 --> 43:48.260
fix it they just it was it was a bug in the date and as soon as the date changed

43:48.260 --> 43:54.700
all better so some somebody fucked up and thought 2010 was a leap year and

43:54.700 --> 43:57.820
somehow that made it in the old fucking PlayStation here's here's my fucking

43:57.820 --> 44:03.300
problem with that is apparently the those chips were actually the same chips

44:03.300 --> 44:08.980
that were in the zooms and you may not remember the end of 2008 I think when a

44:08.980 --> 44:13.540
switched over the end of the year they like fucking New Year's yeah it was like

44:13.540 --> 44:17.860
New Year's and all the students stopped working because of the arm CPU chip and

44:17.860 --> 44:21.300
apparently there's a date bug in that too and oh guess what the same chip was

44:21.300 --> 44:26.020
actually inside you know the PlayStation 3 all along and it was a known problem

44:26.020 --> 44:34.060
but they just kind of we forgot all about it you have fuck soon I don't

44:34.060 --> 44:42.620
didn't well I don't have one anymore times get tough but yes I mean you know

44:42.620 --> 44:46.980
you don't really want your whatever to stop working all of a sudden because oh

44:46.980 --> 44:54.500
we didn't realize there's a bug in here and that's a problem I don't know and it

44:54.500 --> 44:57.500
doesn't look good when your console stop fucking working the only advice they can

44:57.500 --> 45:03.860
give you is don't play guess what Sony I was already not doing that or doing that

45:03.860 --> 45:07.980
whatever I know don't play your ps3 for a day okay I can fucking do that that's

45:07.980 --> 45:14.500
very easy so um what the what the fuck else is I gonna say about this oh here's

45:14.500 --> 45:18.260
the thing yes Sony is is wearing a lot of fucking egg on their face for this

45:18.260 --> 45:21.580
colossal fuck up and you know a lot of people are razzing them this week and

45:21.580 --> 45:28.660
rightfully so but honestly is the red ring of death any fucking better I'd

45:28.660 --> 45:34.020
rather have all the ps3s go down for a day and have it be all you know hunky

45:34.020 --> 45:40.580
dory afterwards and have all the 360s go down permanently but but I will say this

45:40.580 --> 45:44.580
it does kind of show that it's kind of fucked up that when something like this

45:44.580 --> 45:48.300
happens I can't fucking play heavy rain or some of the other games that connect

45:48.300 --> 45:52.700
to the network their needs it's very reminiscent of that very controversial

45:52.700 --> 45:56.900
Ubisoft DRM that I know we're going to get into later in the show but it just

45:56.900 --> 46:01.860
fucking strikes me as like a little hint of that and I do not like that do not

46:01.860 --> 46:06.900
fucking want so there's a piece of me that's like Sony doesn't need to fucking

46:06.900 --> 46:12.420
fix the date issue Sony needs to fucking fix the I can't play my games online if

46:12.420 --> 46:16.100
something is broken on their end issue that's the fucking problem well here's

46:16.100 --> 46:19.620
the other fucking thing that it's really bad is since they didn't really do

46:19.620 --> 46:23.220
anything I mean is this actually gonna get passed out or like four years from

46:23.220 --> 46:27.660
now are we gonna run in the same fucking problem again I will forget about it

46:27.660 --> 46:32.940
it's okay oh yeah you remember that one time that all those ps3s went fucking

46:32.940 --> 46:39.100
down yeah it's gonna happen again cuz it's not a leap year but try telling

46:39.100 --> 46:48.340
that to the PlayStation it makes whatever year it wants fucking leap so

46:48.340 --> 46:54.020
well is there a fucking possibility this is gonna happen in the future I don't

46:54.020 --> 46:56.860
think it will be because they'll be probably patched out let's put it

46:56.860 --> 47:03.380
something to ignore it all right in other fucking Sony news we have news

47:03.380 --> 47:06.380
about their fucking motion controller that's been kind of quiet ever since the

47:06.380 --> 47:09.660
last e3 but I'm assuming that it's because they're gonna have some fucking

47:09.660 --> 47:16.220
new news this year at e3 but the term PlayStation arc has been fucking

47:16.220 --> 47:21.260
trademarked in Japan so you know we were calling the fucking ice cream cones that

47:21.260 --> 47:26.020
light up as you wave them around like a freak apparently is gonna be called the

47:26.020 --> 47:30.180
PlayStation arc which is not like these fucking new news because you know they

47:30.180 --> 47:33.140
might remember there was a story earlier in the year where this fucking guy I

47:33.140 --> 47:39.300
think at THQ had said the name earlier anyway so PlayStation arc sounds like

47:39.300 --> 47:44.500
it's gonna be the fucking name but we'll see now also to kind of take that a step

47:44.500 --> 47:49.340
further apparently Konami has a trademarked a game name and it's called

47:49.340 --> 47:56.060
Gradius arc you know what I this is you know just me thinking out of my ass but

47:56.060 --> 47:59.900
um you know what I think arc could stand for

47:59.900 --> 48:07.300
augmentive reality controller oh look at you look at me my fucking acronyms yeah

48:07.300 --> 48:12.220
yeah I mean there's only unintelligent people swear I like that I think you're

48:12.220 --> 48:15.260
right I think fucking arc is an acronym for something I think that's a very

48:15.260 --> 48:18.820
fucking realistic because all the stuff that they were showing in like their

48:18.820 --> 48:23.420
demos were augmented reality demos either that or it's gonna be specific

48:23.420 --> 48:30.020
for all arc the lad games I somehow really fucking doubt that or you'll

48:30.020 --> 48:35.740
build a stick two of each animal into that controller shut up it will be the

48:35.740 --> 48:40.820
controller how the fuck will that work playing fucking Gradius with a motion

48:40.820 --> 48:44.140
controller do you fucking just flail around to move your fucking ship all

48:44.140 --> 48:47.420
around and then pew pew pew with your button like I don't fucking understand

48:47.420 --> 48:50.940
that how does how is Gradius gonna incorporate motion control that makes no

48:50.940 --> 48:56.860
sense oh by the way Becky just alerted me to something what's that that um cuss

48:56.860 --> 49:02.980
free week did not pass the Senate no it was it was on the news and everything

49:02.980 --> 49:09.980
oh I'll see if I can get her to send me a link maybe there's more well still

49:09.980 --> 49:13.500
still it doesn't matter because it doesn't matter the fucking point still

49:13.500 --> 49:18.140
stands whether it passed or not because they wasted their fucking time actually

49:18.140 --> 49:22.100
voting on this it's even worse if it didn't fucking pass because they wasted

49:22.100 --> 49:29.620
all the fucking time for fucking nothing so fuck them yeah any attack on my free

49:29.620 --> 49:33.220
I don't know how you would fucking play Gradius though with a motion controller

49:33.220 --> 49:38.380
the only thing I could think of is that maybe you control the options that way

49:38.380 --> 49:43.420
or something I don't know me I flail around and knock the ships out of the

49:43.420 --> 49:49.060
way it sounds dumb well name but the thing sounds dumb they also passed they

49:49.060 --> 49:55.020
did pass California acupuncture day what the fuck I am not even gonna try to

49:55.020 --> 49:59.500
dignify that one let's move on to another fucking news story dark Sakura

49:59.500 --> 50:03.060
what the fuck you have for us well I have something and I actually just

50:03.060 --> 50:10.940
posted pictures up on our fucking website there are ESRB listings for ps3

50:10.940 --> 50:16.080
and PSP games there is alpha mission 2 baseball stars professional league

50:16.080 --> 50:20.900
bowling and super sidekicks which are all neogeo titles to pop up on the PSN

50:20.900 --> 50:26.700
so maybe we would see them and you know as soon as I saw the little capture

50:26.700 --> 50:32.180
caption on the on destructoid I had to go grab my game and take a picture that

50:32.180 --> 50:37.020
is a big fucking box for a video game it is god bless those games fucking stars

50:37.020 --> 50:42.420
oh and by the way paid 48 bucks for it yikes yeah but keep in mind how much we

50:42.420 --> 50:45.900
paid for fucking king of fighters 2000 that's true weren't those fucking games

50:45.900 --> 50:51.460
like fucking $200 and they first we paid 350 for it but at the time all the

50:51.460 --> 50:55.540
others were the other sites were selling it for about 400 so we got a really good

50:55.540 --> 51:03.140
fucking deal on it all right yeah um some some fucking clarifications in our

51:03.140 --> 51:05.780
chat room because of course they the chat room gets all sicked on it and

51:05.780 --> 51:10.540
everything it did fucking pass the assembly but it was rejected in the

51:10.540 --> 51:15.300
Senate is there like a high crisis my point still stands it was a waste of

51:15.300 --> 51:18.820
fucking time no matter what happened and that this was even allowed to get

51:18.820 --> 51:22.680
somewhere and that people are fucking listening to this guy and you know what

51:22.680 --> 51:26.060
they stand for and everything so point still stands and besides you all have

51:26.060 --> 51:29.160
been one in the fucking fuck show for like a year and a half this is a good

51:29.160 --> 51:32.100
fucking reason the jokes been running for like a year and a half so now is as

51:32.100 --> 51:39.840
good of a time as any all right Loki yes so apparently there's been a whole lot

51:39.840 --> 51:46.780
of drama going on with Activision this week earlier this week Activision had I

51:46.780 --> 51:54.420
guess let go the two the two leads over at infinity Ward

51:54.420 --> 52:03.100
Vince Zappanella and Jason West and these two studio heads just all the

52:03.100 --> 52:08.780
sudden aren't working there anymore and now more and more information you know

52:08.780 --> 52:14.500
kind of came out about that and apparently it was according to a bunch

52:14.500 --> 52:19.940
of lawsuits here because now they're filing lawsuits against Activision for

52:19.940 --> 52:25.860
unpaid royalties apparently these guys you know they did all their hard work on

52:25.860 --> 52:29.740
modern warfare 2 or whatever and Activision wanted them you know they're

52:29.740 --> 52:34.660
kind of strong arming them into making you know the next modern warfare game or

52:34.660 --> 52:39.220
whatever next you know war game take place in Vietnam and whatever the case

52:39.220 --> 52:44.380
may be but to get out of paying them royalties they decided to go ahead and

52:44.380 --> 52:51.580
let them go and so it's kind of interesting now of course they their

52:51.580 --> 52:54.780
comments on it we were shocked by Activision's decision to terminate our

52:54.780 --> 52:59.620
contracts we poured our heart and soul into that company building not only a

52:59.620 --> 53:03.340
world-class development studio but assembling a team we've been proud to

53:03.340 --> 53:07.700
work with for nearly a decade we think that the work we've done speaks for

53:07.700 --> 53:12.460
itself and it says after all um all we have given Activision we shouldn't have

53:12.460 --> 53:19.260
to sue to get paid and of course Activision you know responding to their

53:19.260 --> 53:23.060
lawsuit they say that they're disappointed in the lawsuit and that

53:23.060 --> 53:28.300
it's meritless says Activision is disappointed that mr. as Zamper Ella and

53:28.300 --> 53:33.580
mr. West have chosen to file a lawsuit with and believes their claims are

53:33.580 --> 53:37.500
meritless over eight years Activision shareholders provided these executives

53:37.500 --> 53:41.700
with their capital they needed to start in Finney Ward so basically they say hey

53:41.700 --> 53:46.540
we made you now we can break you as well as financial support resources and

53:46.540 --> 53:49.860
creative independence that helped them flourish and achieve enormous

53:49.860 --> 53:53.820
professional success and personal yes because if they didn't give them money

53:53.820 --> 53:57.780
I'm sure that they couldn't create these wonderful games is what they're saying

53:57.780 --> 54:02.980
you know granted that studios do need you know money to get going but I think

54:02.980 --> 54:06.140
it's just a creative talent behind it that creates the games anyways I

54:06.140 --> 54:10.060
continues in return Activision legitimately expected them to honor

54:10.060 --> 54:14.460
their obligations to Activision just like any other executives who hold

54:14.460 --> 54:18.700
positions and trust in the company while the company showed enormous patience it

54:18.700 --> 54:22.220
firmly believes its decision was justified based on the courses of

54:22.220 --> 54:29.220
conduct and act actions basically long story short they were unhappy with what

54:29.220 --> 54:34.300
was going on with Activision and so they were the rumor is that they were kind of

54:34.300 --> 54:37.840
shopping around elsewhere not the only ones that are kind of had their fucking

54:37.840 --> 54:40.940
fill of Activision and that's for sure can I read this quick comment from chat

54:40.940 --> 54:44.740
from odd fuck again the opinions in our chat room are not necessarily those of

54:44.740 --> 54:48.180
us here on the show but here's odd fuck in our chat room Bobby Kotek needs to

54:48.180 --> 54:51.180
die in a fucking fire with fucking fire ants on his face while everyone fucking

54:51.180 --> 54:57.220
pisses on him might be a little bit extreme but but isn't tonight all about

54:57.220 --> 55:02.080
extremes um here's the thing though I I kind of fucking believe this guy's days

55:02.080 --> 55:06.400
this guy's days are numbered Activision has such a fucking bad rap right now

55:06.400 --> 55:11.020
there has been just like this one two three four punch you have the fucking

55:11.020 --> 55:15.940
king's quest game gets shut down you have the fucking all these subsidies of

55:15.940 --> 55:19.180
Activision getting shut down all the stuff that's fucking going on now with

55:19.180 --> 55:23.340
you know their biggest selling game I mean the Bobby Kotek is looks like a

55:23.340 --> 55:28.120
fucking buffoon right now like if I were a shareholder I would be demanding some

55:28.120 --> 55:33.020
fucking answers and calling for some fucking you know I I just think it's

55:33.020 --> 55:37.820
they look stupid and unfortunately you know if infinity what it would comes

55:37.820 --> 55:43.700
down to is if infinity ward ends up you know dissolving or whatever me though

55:43.700 --> 55:47.900
let's move on to because they were before they were behind Medal of Honor

55:47.900 --> 55:51.420
and stuff they were working on that series and they left to go form you know

55:51.420 --> 55:56.700
this new company basically to you know create the Call of Duty series and the

55:56.700 --> 56:00.740
Call of Duty series has been really awesome but you know if they're gonna be

56:00.740 --> 56:04.420
treated like dicks I mean come on Activision's been so awful now that

56:04.420 --> 56:08.900
they're making EA look fucking awesome I want to address some fucking good points

56:08.900 --> 56:12.420
in chat shadow fucking runner says Robert they still making money and why

56:12.420 --> 56:15.140
oh I are says Rob it doesn't matter people are still buying their products

56:15.140 --> 56:18.620
in droves the shareholders demands results well hold on guys because all

56:18.620 --> 56:21.740
this fucking stuff has come out like literally within the past couple weeks

56:21.740 --> 56:24.340
and although we've kind of known Activision's I'm going down a shady

56:24.340 --> 56:27.260
path for a while this whole one-two punch I'm talking about is just in the

56:27.260 --> 56:32.060
past couple weeks so you're gonna I don't mean he's gonna fucking get you

56:32.060 --> 56:37.380
know pulled from the board tomorrow but wait about six months to a year wait a

56:37.380 --> 56:41.860
little while and see when that next modern warfare games comes out if it's

56:41.860 --> 56:47.340
not fucking up to par it's over if guitar hero sucks it's over they're done

56:47.340 --> 56:50.900
guitar hero is done for if the next fucking game sucks you know what I mean

56:50.900 --> 56:55.060
wait for kind of you kind of have to wait to see how this all plays out but

56:55.060 --> 57:00.460
if some of these decisions lead to really bad things the holiday season

57:00.460 --> 57:04.660
just look it will have a you how they treat their franchises I mean Call of

57:04.660 --> 57:09.100
Duty they're putting out new ones every year I mean they're basically the whole

57:09.100 --> 57:12.660
reason they even you know take on you know brutal legend that kind of stuff

57:12.660 --> 57:17.340
and Ghostbusters well we can't figure out a way to pump out a new game every

57:17.340 --> 57:22.500
year in this franchise so we're just not gonna take it and then same with guitar

57:22.500 --> 57:26.260
hero I mean look how they're treating like download content stuff very little

57:26.260 --> 57:32.140
each month and look at DJ here what Wow two download packs thanks thanks a lot

57:32.140 --> 57:36.620
way to support it I will fucking say this though you do have a fucking point

57:36.620 --> 57:39.780
that it's about the money they can do all the fucking dickhead things they

57:39.780 --> 57:44.300
want in the world in the end it's about the money but my little but with that is

57:44.300 --> 57:48.940
or my big but depending on whatever you want to look at it as don't

57:48.940 --> 57:55.580
underestimate the the gamers and the kind of the impact that all that

57:55.580 --> 57:59.780
negative press on all the blogs and shit can have I could be wrong and that's

57:59.780 --> 58:03.420
fucking fine I think it's gonna come down unfortunately it's gonna fucking be

58:03.420 --> 58:07.980
just like you know the protests or whatever what Call of Duty you know how

58:07.980 --> 58:11.540
they're saying oh we're protesting this game we're not gonna fucking buy it yeah

58:11.540 --> 58:15.900
and sure enough everyone's buying it you know or you know the Left 4 Dead thing

58:15.900 --> 58:18.820
of course that's a different company but still you know remember fucking the

58:18.820 --> 58:22.940
Left 4 Dead fucking thing on Steam that all the fucking people were playing

58:22.940 --> 58:26.940
Left 4 Dead 2 where they got the screenshot yeah same same story so if

58:26.940 --> 58:30.100
you really fucking mean it if you're really fucking you pissed off that these

58:30.100 --> 58:34.580
guys got fired for all their hard work then you need to stop fucking buying the

58:34.580 --> 58:38.700
games just stop don't buy the next Call of Duty game it's not gonna be an

58:38.700 --> 58:43.260
infinity Ward game anyways I mean that's if you want to wait the way you want to

58:43.260 --> 58:46.540
look at it I mean look at they're gonna put Treyarch and you know charge of it

58:46.540 --> 58:51.020
and unfortunately Treyarch is just not as good as Infinity Ward I mean people

58:51.020 --> 58:59.740
even know that I just I don't know just you know vote with your money all right

58:59.740 --> 59:05.860
let's talk about some fucking titties how's that sound perk there's there's

59:05.860 --> 59:10.340
one thing better than freedom of speech it's nudity and there's some titties to

59:10.340 --> 59:14.860
be found in fucking heavy rain here's the deal I won't try to spoil the story

59:14.860 --> 59:18.540
too bad but there is a love scene that happens at one point in the game you

59:18.540 --> 59:21.100
know should be fucking obvious if you've seen some of the previous of the game

59:21.100 --> 59:24.980
that it kind of pushed the envelope so there's a love scene now if you decline

59:24.980 --> 59:30.780
the kiss and trigger the sequence anyway and reload your saved game right away

59:30.780 --> 59:35.860
then you'll have the female lead running around titties flapping around

59:35.860 --> 59:40.860
everything is all just hanging out so there you go you can run around and play

59:40.860 --> 59:48.300
naked now of course the naked model was not made in the game to be run around

59:48.300 --> 59:53.100
and play naked well but there's a shower scene that happens in the in the oh I saw

59:53.100 --> 59:58.140
this what's interesting here here's the fucking part I think is interesting

59:58.140 --> 01:00:00.780
though is that you know since everybody gets all fucking bent out of shape

01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:04.820
because a nudity specifically the ESRB is this game gonna go back to the board

01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:07.820
for an AO rating isn't this the same fucking thing that happened in oblivion

01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:12.660
for the PC version ended up getting pulled and fucking rated AO because even

01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:17.700
though you weren't supposed to be able to ever see the titties the titties were

01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:23.580
there because they fucking would use them to base like a sheer top on I think

01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:28.580
though that it's still okay because you actually do see that model in the game

01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:32.060
it's just now that you're using that model for more than just that one scene

01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:36.220
but isn't I mean for whatever reason I think it's fucking stupid but the the

01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:39.820
fucks out there the rate things are like there's a big difference between a butt

01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:44.580
and a pussy yeah but if they didn't all that is is 100 here's the thing if they

01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:48.980
didn't if that model wasn't in the game if it was just like you know she's

01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:51.980
behind a shower curtain or something like that and they're just using that

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:56.740
model or whatever for like a silhouette or something that's different but you

01:00:56.740 --> 01:01:00.600
actually use this model in the game for one of the scenes you actually see her

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:05.540
completely naked so it's just if they're gonna you know are you anything it's

01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:10.340
gonna be fucking duration why didn't they just do like the Sims pixel thing

01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:15.540
watch I miss fucking cleo right here watch next week on the fucking show

01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:20.620
there's gonna be a story about some mother filing a fucking lawsuit against

01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:25.660
because they fucking found this in the game because their kid read about this

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:29.500
on the internet on one of the gaming blogs so they fucking go in and unlock

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:32.720
the character and suddenly mom walks in and there's some fucking titties on the

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:36.060
screen and she fucking loses her shit not knowing that that's the game she

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:40.340
bought for her kid and there's a fucking lawsuit next week's show that'll be a

01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:46.340
story if not next week two weeks but the bodies in the game already it would be

01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:52.740
just the same badge and everything it would be just the same is if they he

01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:58.460
didn't there's a lot or whatever and um you know nope no if they didn't do the

01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:04.420
mod or whatever and just the shower scene it would be exactly the same I

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:08.660
hope you're right that there's no basis but I don't know her boobs don't move

01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:12.220
like real boobs I have a feeling well I don't think you were ever supposed to be

01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:15.600
able to just fucking walk her around and shit like that yeah uncanny valley my

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:23.420
ass I'm sorry that doesn't all look real we need some real looking titties we

01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:28.500
need to we need team ninja to fix this yeah yeah range of motion in the face

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:34.460
but where is the range of motion in the fucking titties not rare dark soccer has

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:36.920
got a fucking new story for us then we'll get into some fucking release

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:43.540
dates yes fucking story happy fucking birthday PlayStation 2 dude I totally

01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:50.420
want someone to make me a ps2 cake that'd be cool anyway um yeah ten years

01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:58.500
ago ps2 launched in Japan yay um I have a Japanese ps2 me too I have the first

01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:02.340
model one and it still works I bought mine I don't even know if mine still

01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:05.000
fucking works I haven't touched it in years I bought it a little ways later I

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.500
bought it for beat me in a 2d x6 style because I was fucking addicted to 2d x

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:14.040
I think that's what we got ours for too and that and playing some of some of the

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:17.820
the few JRPGs that I had some of the fucking cool kids in town they had their

01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:21.900
ps2 is for third and fourth style I didn't get on that train till about six

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:25.500
thousand and first they can beat me in a game the big thing that gets me on this

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:29.220
one is that there actually are people that still use their ps2 there's still

01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:35.100
ps2 games being released so we're looking at a ten-year-old system it's

01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:38.180
not funny that people never fucking believe that the PlayStation 3 has a

01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:42.240
ten-year life cycle and people go that's too fucking long look at the ps2 it is

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:46.660
still fucking going after ten years yep yeah so a ten-year life cycle is very

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:51.740
valid at the end of its life cycle but yes it's so it needs to be put down you

01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:56.700
know so a happy fucking birthday PlayStation 2 just just really fucking

01:03:56.700 --> 01:04:00.700

01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:05.580
of the important PlayStation 2 moments for you that like had an impact on

01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:10.000
gaming for you you know like as a Final Fantasy fanboy I think playing fucking

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.340
Final Fantasy 10 for the first time was a huge moment for me I know about you

01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:16.580
guys what was like a huge moment in PlayStation gaming for you I bet I bet I

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:24.620
know Loki's Grand Theft Auto 3 that was good but driver 3 it introduced me to

01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:33.540
the lowest of the low the guy game ps2 for me fucking beat me into DX sorry

01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:40.220

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:14.780
got a now this is gonna bother me but I just the day that I beat everything in

01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:20.620
light 7 although I still haven't done it in fourth style because of no I did beat

01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:23.060
that I beat everything in fourth cells it was third style I didn't because I

they were waiting for you fucking Charan says play shadow of the

01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:11.180

well happy fucking birthday ps2 and for those of you still playing the ps2 you

01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:18.140
might want to think about upgrading although I will say I do hope that the

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:21.400
fucking backwards compatibility comes to the PlayStation 3 at some point and I

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:26.300
know this is a big fucking wrap around I don't want to dread dirt mine has it I

01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:30.460
know some of the old-ass systems do but by the time those systems break they're

01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:35.220
gonna want to put out on the fucking marketplace ps2 games for download we

01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:39.100
all know it's coming it's just a matter of when but the reason why I said put

01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:43.060
out the reason why I somewhat welcome it I'm a little iffy on it I want to go

01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:46.020
back and play Final Fantasy 12 again without having to hook up my ps2 you

01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:48.660
want to know how many times I guess I would pay $20 to know how many

01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:52.420
PlayStation 2 games I've played in my ps3 that's fully backwards compatible

01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:57.980

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:15.300
franchise that I wish they'd bring back jumping flash could you imagine a ps3

01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:19.540
jumping flash that'd be fucking crack that would be epic you know what else

01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:25.860
I've I played a lot of games on my xbox 360 backwards compatibility as well a

01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:32.380

uh funny enough is Final Fantasy 14 is coming out this year too Wow

01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:54.060
it's a sign of the apocalypse maybe two Final Fantasy games in a year possibly

01:08:54.060 --> 01:09:00.180
three I don't know um okay so other stuff coming out 50 classic games on the

01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:03.220
DS well I'm thinking that there's games in there somewhere

01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:07.420
Resident Evil 5 gold edition it's Resident Evil 5 but better with more

01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:14.820
stuff yay and slightly cheaper Sam max 2 beyond time and space coming out as a

01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:22.340
compilation on PC and we case you didn't buy them all separately calling on the

01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:30.060
Nintendo Wii which shares cover almost with final not Final Fantasy with

01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:38.060
obsessed much are we yes Final Fantasy Final Fantasy no um now it shares a box

01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:44.580
art with almost Silent Hill and it looks Silent Hill ish maybe but it's not

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:51.340
photo showdown for the DSI it's right DSI not DS it's a game sort of like

01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:56.380
monster rancher except you use the pictures that you take with your DSI

01:09:56.380 --> 01:09:59.420
camera and based on the colors that are in there it creates different monsters

01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:03.900
not quite as cool as you know putting random CDs in your PlayStation 2 or

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:08.740
barcode scanner or the barcode scanner yes that's true we need to bring back

01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:18.180
barcode scanners Assassin's Creed 2 on PC this week wait a second I'm confused

01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:22.940
it's not supposed to be out yet right yeah people are complaining about not

01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:26.660
being able to play it I'm thinking that that dates wrong it must be out on steam

01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:30.540
or something you know the box versions coming out this week also racket sports

01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:35.500
coming out on the Wii it's Ubisoft's answer to Wii sports and it features all

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:39.780
different games you can play with rackets and they also have support for

01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:45.060
the stupid camera that came with you self fitness because you know all those

01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:50.060
games that use cameras for motion capture have been so awesome so far

01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:17.980
game that's getting lots of controversy for stuff that they've localized and

01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:25.140

01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:31.860

01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:17.780
to fucking remind everybody that is not part of the deal because the game makes

01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:23.460

01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:52.380

01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:56.300

of the week everybody fucking loves the classic game of the week and I'm sure

01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:44.220
Dark Sakura picked a pretty fucking good one this week she usually does but just

01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:48.060
a few more stories before we get there I know you could all use a break to wash

01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:54.300
your mouths out with soap there's been some interesting fucking updates to the

01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:58.700
game portal this week they had a couple updates did you see the cover of Game

01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:05.660
Informer yes it did hmm jumping ahead of me here that's right so the first update

01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:12.500
that was out there was a patch that added some more radio dialogue I guess

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:18.780
and there was some different messages that were in Morse code also some

01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:24.620
encoded messages with the numbers and equations in them and this was all part

01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:28.980
of like the radio that you would hear you know every now and then I think it

01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:33.780
was also in the room that you started off in and it was all kind of hinting

01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:38.300
different things now the people that looked at those images or whatever that

01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:45.980
was in the little radio messages it's kind of funny they actually found a

01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:54.180
phone number for a BBS you know those old things prior to the internet fucking

01:17:54.180 --> 01:18:01.740
loved BBS's do yes you can't fucking trade wars 2002 what or was it 2020 I

01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:05.060
don't remember but you know all those fucking games were amazing but I should

01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:09.000
have the red fucking dragon enough said and then on of course those BBS's they

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:15.180
found you know ASCII art featuring some stuff looks like different robots and

01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:22.180
whatever from possibly portal to very interesting looking some apparently this

01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:27.740
is going to be some sort of ARG type of thing so that'll be kind of neat and

01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:31.740
then I just realized not all our chatters know what a BBS is God I feel

01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:35.940
old I'm really fucking sorry for not explaining it but BBS's ok back before

01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:39.220
there was the internet or if you want to get technical the internet existed them

01:18:39.220 --> 01:18:42.980
but it was only for fucking government people and stuff so back when like I was

01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:46.380
in fucking high school and probably about the time with the board system

01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:50.580
is you would have to dial in with a modem some guy would fucking hosted on

01:18:50.580 --> 01:18:54.580
their computer or gal and you would dial in on your modem and connect to it and

01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:57.380
then it was kind of like it had forums and a lot of the stuff that you kind of

01:18:57.380 --> 01:19:02.980
see in a new forum on the internet today but you know is a very community type of

01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:05.700
thing you didn't usually talk to people because you know people didn't want to

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:08.180
call long distance and run up their phone bill so it's a very local thing

01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:12.180
usually yeah like I mean back in the day we have this free publication that was

01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:16.860
around called California computer news I fucking remember that man BBS's in the

01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:21.020
back BBS was seen in the back yeah you can you dial up I mean this is back in

01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:25.500
the day was ZZT and I download ZZT and I mean this is back also in the day when

01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:30.460
you know they had shareware which is you know kind of like you will take you 45

01:19:30.460 --> 01:19:34.260
minutes to download the fucking Wolfenstein 3d like a demo you know for

01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:37.260
a game not really even a demo for game but it'd be like the first episode for a

01:19:37.260 --> 01:19:41.220
game would be like about five bucks or whatever you would go you know buy a

01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:44.980
floppy disk from you know whatever retailer and you would have the first

01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:48.420
it'd be a full game but it wouldn't be like the full full game you'd actually

01:19:48.420 --> 01:19:51.940
go buy a new retail game but give you a really good idea what the game is like

01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:57.020
and you could go on these servers and sometimes they would host the full

01:19:57.020 --> 01:20:00.420
version of the game and you could download it for free or like you know I

01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:05.540
would download you know back before mp3s you know mod files and stuff like that

01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:12.460
you know different electronica you synthesize Amiga music files and stuff

01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:16.740
like that so they would have you all sorts of stuff and I remember actually

01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:21.940
the first time that there was mp3s I was like holy shit was an mp3 so that's kind

01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:25.020
of cool but yeah back in the day you used to go in there and you could

01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:29.020
sometimes it also have it where you could host like you know multiplayer

01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:34.460
doom games online stuff like that I remember that into online this was you

01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:40.580
know back in the day with you this was all that we had it was not the internet

01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:44.300
it was like which bbs can you get into and you know what cool files that they

01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:48.540
have on there and you know I had to download them in the Y protocol or the

01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:53.300
Z protocol X protocol yeah most people don't know the hell I'm talking about

01:20:53.300 --> 01:20:58.260
as ways you download stuff it wasn't as easy as click a file and it downloads

01:20:58.260 --> 01:21:03.180
speaking of mod files because I apparently perked some years up in chat

01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:07.260
there was an epic fucking gauntlet theme mod that was out there on the internet

01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:10.380
was like one of my favorite mod files ever it was the music files I don't know

01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:14.980
what mod stand for music something something but I believe it was want to

01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:19.020
see what mode tracks it was Commodore based but you know the PC had a lot of

01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:22.980
support for it too they had like s3m which is like scream tracker there

01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:27.860
basically it's it's tracker things like it was like MIDI where the MIDI you

01:21:27.860 --> 01:21:33.500
trigger your different instruments that are hard coded into your graphics you're

01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:39.100
not graphics or your sound card well mods what they were is it was basically

01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:42.740
different sample files like WAV files that you put in there and it was

01:21:42.740 --> 01:21:46.300
triggered like MIDI was so you would have like new people could record their

01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:49.980
voice record like actual guitars and stuff like that and it would be

01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:53.620
triggered and you could create new electrical music or electronic music

01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:58.340
with that alright anything else you want to say about portal before we go to the

01:21:58.340 --> 01:22:02.060
next anyways yeah so they get back in the portal yeah there's some pretty cool

01:22:02.060 --> 01:22:08.860
stuff coming out they also added an extended ending to portal which kind of

01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:14.260
made it creepy you may remember if you finish the game a lot of people have you

01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:19.780
end up kind of at outside while you know the whole lab kind of falls out of the

01:22:19.780 --> 01:22:24.980
sky because it exploded well this extra ending that they've added 15 seconds

01:22:24.980 --> 01:22:32.100
it's all thank you for you know you know thank you for going into like was at the

01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:41.060
escort posture whatever escort position yeah the further your party yes well yes

01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:44.900
escort party position or something like that and you you're getting like dragged

01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:50.300
away by your head it's kind of crazy very creepy but like all hinting towards

01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:53.460
portal to which they already did announce that there's gonna be a portal

01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:58.100
to I believe and if they haven't well well there's big fucking done of course

01:22:58.100 --> 01:23:02.860
portal to me it was the best fucking game that came out that year you know

01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:07.400
yes of course is gonna be one and of course it was already confirmed by Game

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:12.660
Informer their cover is actually portal to and it shows kind of looks like

01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:16.620
after science was just like all these vines and stuff growing from the outside

01:23:16.620 --> 01:23:19.860
you kind of in through portals and stuff like that what's going to be kind of

01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:24.100
unique about it the game will be coming out on a PlayStation or not PlayStation

01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:33.140
PC Xbox 360 and Mac platforms and it will be two-player co-op and it's gonna

01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:36.740
have it's gonna be a lot of fun interesting looking things in there so

haven't worked because they are shutting it down April 15th but Microsoft is

01:23:58.380 --> 01:24:01.620
being really fucking nice and extending an olive branch to those of you clinging

01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:05.420
to Halo 2 if you are still clinging to Halo 2 you might want to check your

01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:11.940

01:24:25.220 --> 01:24:29.700
number of hours in the past month but still kind of pretty fucking cool

01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:32.940
Microsoft to do I suppose it's better than what they're required to do which

01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:36.860
is nothing so I'm sure there's a lot of people that are going to be fucking

01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:41.260
happy that they can get some bonuses there if they're not too fucking pissed

01:24:41.260 --> 01:24:47.180
off about Halo 2 going away so there you go what would be really fucking nice of

01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:50.500
Microsoft to do would be to just say you know if you want to run your own private

01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:54.220
servers here you go but I guess you can't really do that on the Xbox 360 and

01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:59.220
Halo 2 is not going away on the PC something to remember so if you really

01:24:59.220 --> 01:25:03.220
want to cling cling to your halo 2 for dear life remember you can't always play

01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:08.420
on the PC speaking of clinging to things for dear life dark Sakura every week

01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:11.380
likes to jump into the fucking vault and pull out some really fucking old and

01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:15.900
moldy game that she says you know what you should be playing this game this

01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:22.200
week so it's the classic fucking game of the week dark Sakura what game did you

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:27.620
pick this week for the kids I picked fucking Contra I haven't done it yet

01:25:27.620 --> 01:25:35.820
figured why the fuck not in Europe it was called Gris or and it was put up by

01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:40.300
Konami it was originally on the arcade and came out for the NES which for the

01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:46.380
PAL region came out as probotector excuse me I burped on the mic um and it

01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:50.340
also came out for the MSX 2 and they're a bunch of sequels because I mean who

01:25:50.340 --> 01:25:56.140
doesn't remember Super C right um so basically you were these guys called

01:25:56.140 --> 01:26:01.820
Bill and Lance who work for a red falcon and are trying to stop an alien invasion

01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:05.500
and Bill and Lance like to run around with those shirts on and carrying big

01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:12.020
guns they wear vests Rob that's not the game and and head and we're headbands

01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:20.380
they do I can't help it if it's not about fucking um so yeah you can get a

01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:24.580
bunch of different um guns you get a machine gun laser gun a fire gun a

01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:31.380
spread gun rapid firepower up all kinds of different fun stuff and then you also

01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:37.060
besides having the typical side scrolling levels you also have a behind

01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:42.500
the back sort of 3d maze level where you have to go in a certain order and shoot

01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:47.540
go through the bases defenses and get to the end and it's really fucking hard I

01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:51.700
mean seriously it's hard if you don't use the Konami code and have somebody

01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:57.700
else playing with you and you can beat this game without dying I I want to meet

01:26:57.700 --> 01:27:02.500
you and have you like sign my arm or something why why are in chat is trying

01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:07.620
to show off his big fucking skills sand cleared both Contra and Super C on NES

01:27:07.620 --> 01:27:11.260
without 10 or 30 lives and without continues who else yeah but did you die

01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:16.220
I want to meet the person who can do it without dying can't Dan do it without

01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:20.660
dying mmm no actually on it fucking thought he could I thought that's why

01:27:20.660 --> 01:27:24.700
you fucking married him no it was our type that he could beat without ah got

01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:30.940
you but also came out on this ZX spectrum Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC by

01:27:30.940 --> 01:27:35.540
the way I need to ask you about Commodore 64 stuff Rob I fucking love

01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:39.620
the Commodore 64 you have a good emulator ah I haven't used one in a long

01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:43.900
time I'm hoping the game room is gonna bring back some of the C64 stuff it's

01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:49.900
because we've done a pretty shitty job it's for someone else okay um but yeah

01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:55.660
they all came those versions all came out in Europe in 1988 the piece the IBM

01:27:55.660 --> 01:28:01.620
PC version was also out in Germany the Commodore 64 and IBM versions later came

01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:09.700
out in North America as Contra but yeah the the NES version was evil and hard

01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:16.100
and it was one of the earliest games to use the Konami code which one of the

01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:21.980
other games that did it was you know before that was of course Gradius and

01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:32.020
for the Falmicon it used a multi memory controller that Konami made for of

01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:35.460
course the Japanese market that gave it additional graphical effects so I don't

01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:38.380
know if anyone's ever played ROM of this but if you play the Japanese ROM the

01:28:38.380 --> 01:28:42.820
um there's animation in the background and other stuff going on the leaves are

01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:49.260
moving and the grass is blowing in the wind and all kinds of fun stuff and it

01:28:49.260 --> 01:28:54.660
also had extra cheat codes like a stage select and a sound test and hidden post

01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:58.340
credits scene that you would hold select and start before and during the entire

01:28:58.340 --> 01:29:03.420
end credits and yeah like I said the European version was called Pro

01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:08.260
Protector and the main guys were turned into robots and it was just because of

01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:14.900
censorship laws in the day fuck censorship but when Contra legacy of war

01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:21.760
and shattered soldier came out they retained the Contra name msx2 was

01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:25.460
actually fairly different than the arcade and the NES version because of

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:30.660
limitations in the hardware it didn't scroll but it used flip screens sort of

01:29:30.660 --> 01:29:35.140
the way that Metal Gear and Vampire Killer did and it was only single-player

01:29:35.140 --> 01:29:42.900
however it did have it did change the last ten stages of the game and the

01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:48.100
msx2 version of Contra is on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan came out on

01:29:48.100 --> 01:29:53.020
February 2nd of this year of course there was a ps2 re-release version for

01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:57.820
Xbox Live arcade digital eclipse handled the conversion there's Konami classics

01:29:57.820 --> 01:30:05.540
series arcade hits for the DS blah blah blah blah blah and you can actually get

01:30:05.540 --> 01:30:08.820
the Konami's collector series Castlevania and Contra for Windows in

01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:14.540
North America which also includes Super C and three Castlevania games and if you

01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:21.780
get Contra IV Contra and Super C on is also included as the DS so yeah pretty

01:30:21.780 --> 01:30:27.540
pretty freaking hard and of course there were a ton of Contra games came after

01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:34.900
there was a Super Contra well Super C well it was Super Contra overseas it was

01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:41.420
Super C here operation C for the Gameboy Contra 3 the Alien Wars for Super NES

01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:46.060
Contra Force furnace Contra hardcore which that's really actually kind of

01:30:46.060 --> 01:30:53.900
hard to on Genesis Konami I love the Super Nintendo one that was awesome

01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:58.980
Konami contracted out for PlayStation Contra Legacy of War which also came out

01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:06.620
on the Saturn see the Contra adventure in 1998 2000 we had a Contra Shattered

01:31:06.620 --> 01:31:11.820
Soldier and Neo Contra Contra IV came out on the Nintendo DS and Contra

01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:17.820
Rebirth by M2 came out for WiiWare our old fucking pal like Kiryamoka did the

01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:21.900
music for Shattered Soldier Soldier if I remember right yes he did and also if

01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:24.300
you were looking for any of the soundtracks from the arcade version of

01:31:24.300 --> 01:31:29.220
Contra the soundtrack is included on Konami game music volume for Ajax which

01:31:29.220 --> 01:31:34.700
came out in 1988 there's actually a vinyl version of that Rob that's fucking

01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:42.180
old yeah so yeah Contra all right like yeah great choice and the chat rooms

01:31:42.180 --> 01:31:46.860
very fucking pleased with that Contra is your classic game of the week also I

01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:52.380
totally recommend watching the angry Nintendo nerd or angry gamer nerd his

01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:57.140
review of Contra it's freaking hilarious all right we're gonna take a quick

01:31:57.140 --> 01:32:01.100
fucking break we'll be back with more of orange lounge radio in just a little bit

01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:16.580
so fucking don't go anywhere we'll be right back

01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:21.020
perhaps one of the most interesting words in the English language today is

01:32:21.020 --> 01:32:27.180
the word fuck out of all of the English words that begin with a letter F fuck is

01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:33.620
the only word that is referred to as the f-word it's the one magical word just by

01:32:33.620 --> 01:32:40.340
its sound can describe pain pleasure hate and love fuck as most words in the

01:32:40.340 --> 01:32:45.060
English language is derived from German the word frickin which means to strike

01:32:45.060 --> 01:32:50.940
in English fuck falls into many grammatical categories as a transitive

01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:58.380
verb for instance John fucked Shirley as an intransitive verb surely fucks its

01:32:58.380 --> 01:33:02.740
meanings not always sexual it can be used as an adjective such as John's

01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:09.980
doing all the fucking work as part of an adverb surely talks to fucking much as

01:33:09.980 --> 01:33:17.260
an adverb enhancing an adjective surely is fucking beautiful as a noun I don't

01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:23.260
give a fuck that's part of a word abso fucking lutely or in fucking credible

01:33:23.260 --> 01:33:29.900
and as almost every word in a sentence fuck the fucking fuckers as you must

01:33:29.900 --> 01:33:34.340
realize there aren't too many words with the versatility of fuck as in these

01:33:34.340 --> 01:33:40.300
examples describing situations such as fraud I got fucked at the used car lot

01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:48.780
dismay off fuck it trouble I guess I'm really fucked now aggression don't fuck

01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:54.060
with me buddy difficulty I don't understand this fucking question

01:33:54.060 --> 01:34:00.100
inquiry who the fuck was that dissatisfaction I don't like what the

01:34:00.100 --> 01:34:07.420

outside and play hide and go fuck yourself I'm sure you can think of many

01:34:12.180 --> 01:34:17.100
more examples with all of these multi-purpose applications how can

01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:23.540
anyone be offended when you use the word we say use this unique flexible word

01:34:23.540 --> 01:34:28.060
more often than your daily speech it will identify the quality of your

01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:39.780
character immediately say it loudly and proudly fuck you welcome back to orange

01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:44.340

01:36:59.220 --> 01:37:04.500

let's get some fucking video game news Loki yes let's talk about some fucking

01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:15.980
sequels including scribble knots to that's right coming from the fucking

01:37:15.980 --> 01:37:20.700
source for Nintendo news Nintendo fucking power there will be another

01:37:20.700 --> 01:37:23.980
scribble that's game and how can they fucking put another one you may ask

01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:26.980
because there are so many words that were in there before because the first

01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:31.660
fucking game sold like fucking hotcakes and it was a huge DS game well here's

01:37:31.660 --> 01:37:35.980
how they're gonna fucking do it they're gonna add 10,000 more words that's right

01:37:35.980 --> 01:37:44.140
10,000 words that's fucking more than 9,000 that's over 9,000 words just

01:37:44.140 --> 01:37:48.540
giving me they were missing fucking 9,000 words apparently gonna be all

01:37:48.540 --> 01:37:53.720
internet me me's this time I don't know but apparently adjectives will play a

01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:58.660
big role this time like you guys summon super Einstein or electric werewolf

01:37:58.660 --> 01:38:06.780
mmm surprising versus electric werewolf I like that baby Cthulhu baby Cthulhu

01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:12.100
fuck yeah the shit out of me anyways it'll deliver apparently a hundred over

01:38:12.100 --> 01:38:20.220
9,000 yes over 9,000 deliver 120 new levels a level editor a new hint system

01:38:20.220 --> 01:38:25.220
and improved controls well better have improved controls because those

01:38:25.220 --> 01:38:33.180
controls so how about actual controls first another not too surprising sequel

01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:37.220
in fact I've known about this for a little bit so calm for being announced

01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:42.980
for PlayStation 3 by zipper the company developed it the last time around for so

01:38:42.980 --> 01:38:46.780
calm confrontation but this is an actual sequel this time and apparently it's

01:38:46.780 --> 01:38:54.300
going to deliver 14 missions with about 12 hours of gameplay and of course you

01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:58.500
know the developer has a pretty good track record when it comes to

01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:03.420
multiplayer games seen as they were behind mag which had 256 players however

01:39:03.420 --> 01:39:11.940
the game will only have 32 player online multiplayer and then this is great

01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:19.620
apparently at the 11th hour Ubisoft has made some emergency changes to their DRM

01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:25.140
on their PC titles apparently great topic for the fuck show apparently there

01:39:25.140 --> 01:39:32.300
was there was some fixes that needed to be make because people were figuring out

01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:39.780
how to crack it and of course they've already cracked it but Ubisoft says that

01:39:39.780 --> 01:39:44.820
players should live should players lose their internet connection a requirement

01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:49.540
under the company's ridiculous new DRM scheme their single-player offline game

01:39:49.540 --> 01:39:54.700
would drop upon reloading you be left with your last checkpoint and not the

01:39:54.700 --> 01:40:00.900
actual point you were cut out now their claim is that no the you know the DRM

01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:06.420
has not been broken in fact those who are playing the cracked version out

01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:10.380
there aren't getting the full game experience and the words are not gain

01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:17.500
access to the you play stuff which no one gives a shit and to kind of go along

01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:22.740
with this in kind of the worst-case scenario situation well the worst-case

01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:27.260
scenario situation happened and apparently their servers went offline

01:40:27.260 --> 01:40:32.380
their Ubisoft DRM often to kid authentication servers they've been down

01:40:32.380 --> 01:40:38.220
and guess what apparently people that had Assassin's Creed 2 can't play it

01:40:38.220 --> 01:40:44.780
right now dole and I smell a fucking class-action lawsuit and apparently yes

01:40:44.780 --> 01:40:49.140
and it's been down for quite a long time and you know there's been people trying

01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:53.220
to log in for like 25 minutes and there are any able to do anything and a new

01:40:53.220 --> 01:40:57.940
be soft representative apparently responded to the forum thread that's

01:40:57.940 --> 01:41:02.740
over on their official Assassin's Creed 2 forum and saying clearly the extended

01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:07.260
downtime and lengthy login issues are unacceptable particularly as I've been

01:41:07.260 --> 01:41:12.580
told these servers are constantly monitored well they apparently watch

01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:18.420
them go down yeah fuck that up didn't you I'm honoring them crushing and then

01:41:18.420 --> 01:41:24.100
they added I'll do whatever what I can to get more information on this issue

01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:29.220
and here's the fruit or more on what the issue is first thing tomorrow and push

01:41:29.220 --> 01:41:34.620
for a resolution is sure it's this will happen again in the future it doesn't

01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:39.500
matter they've already cracked it forget about it because what apparently

01:41:39.500 --> 01:41:43.980
happened is there is a cracker group out there that figured out that hey guess

01:41:43.980 --> 01:41:49.180
what they have some sort of fail-safe and then in the case that will be soft

01:41:49.180 --> 01:41:53.740
size to go out of business that will put out a patch that will apparently disable

01:41:53.740 --> 01:41:58.220
this DRM so that you can play your game just fine well guess what the codes in

01:41:58.220 --> 01:42:08.460
there and they've activated it so thanks to be soft you made it easy we all knew

01:42:08.460 --> 01:42:13.340
this is gonna fucking happen and we all knew it's a stupid idea and guess what

01:42:13.340 --> 01:42:18.700
it's a stupid idea is it a fucking stupid idea it's a fucking stupid idea

01:42:18.700 --> 01:42:22.140
it's the worst idea ever because all you're doing is punching the people that

01:42:22.140 --> 01:42:25.860
legitimately paid for the program the people that want to hack it they're

01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:29.380
gonna wait for a hack version to come out I don't think there's a PC title

01:42:29.380 --> 01:42:33.140
out there that they haven't figured out a way around some sort of DRM for it so

01:42:33.140 --> 01:42:40.180
oh well you know you tried you failed maybe you shouldn't try because it cost

01:42:40.180 --> 01:42:41.180
money to try

01:42:41.180 --> 01:42:45.100
alright so a lot of fucking confusion going on over a highly fucking

01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:48.340
controversial game six days and fallujah you might remember this game was

01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:51.500
supposed to fucking come out and it doesn't like one fucking Konami actually

01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:54.460
put it out because I was putting out and they're like now we don't have fucking

01:42:54.460 --> 01:42:57.180
be associated with this because they're working with terrorists or something

01:42:57.180 --> 01:42:59.940
they're also working with the soldiers that were there and that wasn't gonna

01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:05.700
fucking stop atomic games and apparently IGN reported this week that six days and

01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:10.780
fallujah is finished it's fucking done it is ready to come out but there's no

01:43:10.780 --> 01:43:13.980
fucking release date announced just that the game is sitting there finished now

01:43:13.980 --> 01:43:17.860
atomic games actually fucking followed up to this saying that well IGN yeah

01:43:17.860 --> 01:43:22.500
they talked to somebody at atomic games and the game is finished and it's coming

01:43:22.500 --> 01:43:26.060
out but yeah we have another fucking game we're doing first and then six days

01:43:26.060 --> 01:43:28.740
and fallujah will come out it's finished but that doesn't mean we're not gonna

01:43:28.740 --> 01:43:31.940
fucking upgrade it new fucking features a new fucking technology and whatever the

01:43:31.940 --> 01:43:36.060
fuck we feel like doing basically in a nutshell so I keep an eye on atomic games

01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:38.500
I suppose if you really want more information on this game although I

01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:43.680
don't know the you know how you know that old saying strike when the iron is

01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:52.060
hot yeah well it's like you know the iron is frozen yeah put away anyhow on

01:43:52.060 --> 01:43:54.980
some other fucking news if you still one of these people that don't have a

01:43:54.980 --> 01:43:58.740
fucking Wii for some reason Walmart can sell you the bundle that everybody

01:43:58.740 --> 01:44:03.660
fucking thought would be out already Walmart is selling we owe we in Nintendo

01:44:03.660 --> 01:44:09.180
we Wii Sports Wii Sports Resort and the motion plus attachment it's available

01:44:09.180 --> 01:44:14.900
right now one hundred and ninety nine dollars is the price for this so

01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:19.340
basically it's a normal we thing with Wii Sports Resort with it which you

01:44:19.340 --> 01:44:22.740
know although Walmart I don't know they can kind of be fucking shady about some

01:44:22.740 --> 01:44:28.020
things like I don't know censorship on albums a good deal is still still a good

01:44:28.020 --> 01:44:31.260
deal and if you do not have a Nintendo Wii for whatever reason you want to be

01:44:31.260 --> 01:44:36.500
limited supplies as if the supplies aren't limited enough already yeah so and

01:44:36.500 --> 01:44:39.100
one of the fucking thing I have for you guys before I turn it over to dark

01:44:39.100 --> 01:44:45.540
Sakura Tecmo Bowl there is a new Tecmo Bowl coming it's a new old Tecmo Bowl

01:44:45.540 --> 01:44:49.780
it's a fucking throwback I am actually fucking excited about this I don't talk

01:44:49.780 --> 01:44:52.340
a lot about sports games on this show because I don't fucking play a lot of

01:44:52.340 --> 01:44:55.100
them cuz I know it's gonna sound weird but a lot of them are too fucking

01:44:55.100 --> 01:44:59.180
complicated for me cuz I don't watch a lot of them on TV but I like the kind of

01:44:59.180 --> 01:45:03.460
overly simplified ones like NBA Jam I always love that game in the fucking

01:45:03.460 --> 01:45:07.700
arcades and this new one is somewhat interesting I fucking love Tecmo Bowl on

01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:10.500
the NES I thought it was great so the idea that they're kind of doing this

01:45:10.500 --> 01:45:14.780
throwback I find very fucking exciting this will it feature real sugar this

01:45:14.780 --> 01:45:18.980
time I don't know the idea of this was kind of leaked a little while ago thanks

01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:22.860
to an ESRB rating but now it's been acknowledged Tecmo Bowl throwback is

01:45:22.860 --> 01:45:26.020
coming out on the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network sometime in the

01:45:26.020 --> 01:45:31.860
spring it's a remake of Tecmo Super Bowl you can switch to classic 2d amongst I

01:45:31.860 --> 01:45:36.700
guess the 3d the people who fucking made it are south and interactive they also

01:45:36.700 --> 01:45:41.300
made that fucking loadrunner game and our type the loadrunner ever fucking

01:45:41.300 --> 01:45:46.160
come out on the Xbox 360 yeah sometime ago the R type ones pretty fucking rad

01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:49.340
if that's the R type that's on Xbox Live I think it's probably the r-10 fucking

01:45:49.340 --> 01:45:55.060
rad so this is a good studio to be doing this all new 3d graphics and and and

01:45:55.060 --> 01:46:00.940
online play fuck yeah Tecmo Bowl throwback will have 32 teams online

01:46:00.940 --> 01:46:04.940
leaderboards and customizable options for the teams and the rosters I don't

01:46:04.940 --> 01:46:08.360
know like are these are they gonna be actual teams or no because every fake

01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:12.460
teams the fake teams like just they're called New York and Denver but it's not

01:46:12.460 --> 01:46:17.380
like fucking the New York of the Denver still I'm all over I bet you never

01:46:17.380 --> 01:46:21.020
thought you would hear me say this about a sports game here on OLR I am all

01:46:21.020 --> 01:46:25.940
fucking about this game I am I'm very excited to fucking play this game dark

01:46:25.940 --> 01:46:29.820
soccer has got a few stories for us and then some Twitter topics I sure fucking

01:46:29.820 --> 01:46:37.620
do rock band we are getting some songs white stripes pack which will be for 40

01:46:37.620 --> 01:46:43.500
points $5.50 fell in love with the girls seven nation army and you don't know

01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:47.700
what love is you just do as you're told individual tracks the future has decent

01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:54.460
days and nights hounds of love this wasn't that a Kate Bush song anyway the

01:46:54.460 --> 01:46:58.900
James gang walk away Neil pert the hockey theme and Seamus all of this and

01:46:58.900 --> 01:47:09.260
tie you down and other news there is a K something that was given to me as an

01:47:09.260 --> 01:47:14.100
incomplete link that I have no idea what it is um DJ max technica 2 has a teaser

01:47:14.100 --> 01:47:21.460
out so I guess people can go watch it and then the 8-bit left for dead dude is

01:47:21.460 --> 01:47:27.920
doing Megaman 9 HD remix so keep your eyes open for that although I bet

01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:31.220
nobody's gonna ever fucking play it cuz there'll be a lawsuit that'll stop it if

01:47:31.220 --> 01:47:34.060
they ever try to put that out cuz that's just the fucking way the world works

01:47:34.060 --> 01:47:37.700
I'll try course it's not Activision it's a Capcom who knows maybe they'll be a

01:47:37.700 --> 01:47:41.860
little cooler but I don't know I kind of think you know okay fucking Megaman 10

01:47:41.860 --> 01:47:45.500
came out on the fucking weed this week right and I'm fucking waiting for PSN or

01:47:45.500 --> 01:47:49.220
Xbox 360 before I spend my fucking hard-earned money on this game but I'm

01:47:49.220 --> 01:47:53.620
kind of hearing a lot of the early fucking feedback is that it's kind of

01:47:53.620 --> 01:47:56.960
just Megaman 9 all over again and I'm kind of fucking thinking well wasn't

01:47:56.960 --> 01:48:00.620
Megaman 9 just the first fucking eight games all over again I mean that's what

01:48:00.620 --> 01:48:05.000
the charm was about it has the fucking retro ness of Megaman worn off is is

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:09.980
retro really fucking old now I don't know what do you think Loki is is is

01:48:09.980 --> 01:48:14.780
Megaman 10 too much or what I don't think it's too much I think you know

01:48:14.780 --> 01:48:21.660
it'd be pretty cool to see them release more of these retro games promise they're

01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:26.780
just not as good as Megaman 2 but I don't know I'm kind of glad that they're doing

01:48:26.780 --> 01:48:31.100
that because it really it comes down to those games prove that it's all about

01:48:31.100 --> 01:48:35.580
gameplay it's not necessarily graphics and you don't have to have really shiny

01:48:35.580 --> 01:48:41.220
HD 3d you know modeled graphics for a Megaman game or even a lot of games it

01:48:41.220 --> 01:48:45.580
can be just fine with just you know 8-bit retro stuff and that hell I'd

01:48:45.580 --> 01:48:49.100
like to see a studio that only did that that'd be pretty awesome I think Dark

01:48:49.100 --> 01:48:52.060
Touch Studio raises a fucking good point in chat saying well I don't think

01:48:52.060 --> 01:48:54.660
Capcom would want people playing the equivalent of one of their recent

01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:58.440
releases for free yeah I can see that they're still probably making some

01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:03.060
fucking money off Megaman 9 and so yeah they would shut this shit down if it was

01:49:03.060 --> 01:49:06.540
getting out there too much but I don't think it's a bad thing you know why not

01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:10.420
you know now that they kind of did the fucking retro 3d just go in and make

01:49:10.420 --> 01:49:14.700
some HD sprites keep the same game keep the same just just or even pretty or

01:49:14.700 --> 01:49:18.980
even pretty you know what you could do and here's what they really need to do

01:49:18.980 --> 01:49:23.140
you need to put fucking Megaman 9 and Megaman 10 like on the DS or something

01:49:23.140 --> 01:49:26.500
like that so I can take it with me and play that shit you know I mean those

01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:31.700
ROMs got to be pretty small anyways that aside or new Megaman collection would be

01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:36.160
kind of cool with those in there fuck let's make them if they want to make a

01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:40.120
3d game make them another fucking Megaman Legends that would be fucking

01:49:40.120 --> 01:49:45.100
awesome alright let's get to some Twitter topics

01:49:45.100 --> 01:49:50.440
suit you fucking people on Twitter have to say every week we read your tweets

01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:55.660
show us your tweets at OLR lots of fucking celebration that finally a year

01:49:55.660 --> 01:49:58.660
and a half after I think the idea was first announced we are finally having

01:49:58.660 --> 01:50:02.920
our fucking fuck show up against the Oscars tonight in a moment of protest

01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:06.580
not everybody fucking on board with the fuck show though sturlock sends us a

01:50:06.580 --> 01:50:11.740
tweet to be perfectly honest this joke is already painfully old it's not gonna

01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:18.020
be for everybody keep in mind we're not just doing it to say fuck a lot which

01:50:18.020 --> 01:50:22.100
although I will say that's a nice benefit but it is a protest against

01:50:22.100 --> 01:50:26.180
people taking their time to time out of their busy schedules they should be

01:50:26.180 --> 01:50:30.220
balancing budgets to tell us that we shouldn't swear that swearing makes us

01:50:30.220 --> 01:50:35.220
somehow unintelligent it's the same fucking show tonight just more fuck but

01:50:35.220 --> 01:50:38.420
I don't know I was a little worried coming into it it might get fucking old

01:50:38.420 --> 01:50:42.220
after three hours but we'll see two hours and I still feel pretty fucking

01:50:42.220 --> 01:50:52.300
good you guys doing okay all right let's see spazzinator says some very nasty

01:50:52.300 --> 01:50:55.940
words to Sony I got I bet yeah I bet he'll call in later and say some more

01:50:55.940 --> 01:50:59.780
about that but also says let's see if I got this right this is in response to

01:50:59.780 --> 01:51:03.620
the heavy rain thing spazzinator PSN says let's see if I got this right heads

01:51:03.620 --> 01:51:08.860
blown off fine hot crowbar up the ass fine mass murder fine tits or badge what

01:51:08.860 --> 01:51:17.460
sicko wants to see that fucking shit dude it's like the biggest like I don't

01:51:17.460 --> 01:51:21.940
even know what word you would say to describe this just it's it's just this

01:51:21.940 --> 01:51:29.580
big glaring hypocrisy in in the media and in society that has been going on

01:51:29.580 --> 01:51:35.500
for a very long time it's not just fucking video games but it's movies too

01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:39.340
what's that movie there was some movie about like it's called this movie is

01:51:39.340 --> 01:51:43.300
rated R or something like that it explores like the NC 17 rating fucking

01:51:43.300 --> 01:51:47.860
fascinating dark touch to you once everyone to fucking know that I love

01:51:47.860 --> 01:51:51.660
this song resumes this week on the site that's good I like seeing some more

01:51:51.660 --> 01:51:55.980
fucking content on olr hopefully there's more than just the I love that song

01:51:55.980 --> 01:52:00.060
segment which was you know everything that was on the website but I do I like

01:52:00.060 --> 01:52:03.940
music gaming music is good and so I always like the I love that song segment

01:52:03.940 --> 01:52:08.500
the diversity of stuff that they picked so fuck yeah and lastly Takeo Ray says

01:52:08.500 --> 01:52:12.740
his tweet wants to know so does anyone have an f-bomb count for the show I

01:52:12.740 --> 01:52:18.220
think they lost track in the first fucking like five minutes problem was

01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:21.520
Dark Sakura sat there went fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck and that's faster

01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:25.720
than anyone could probably tally so that's more of something that you'll

01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:29.580
figure out later on once they the podcast comes fucking out hey if every

01:52:29.580 --> 01:52:32.740
if anyone actually wants to sit there and fucking count all the words I'm

01:52:32.740 --> 01:52:37.220
pretty fucking impressed and I mean I doubt it Guinness will pay attention to

01:52:37.220 --> 01:52:40.700
something like this because it's just a fucking podcast but hey they'll pay

01:52:40.700 --> 01:52:43.620
attention to like what the longest pretzel is or some shit like that I

01:52:43.620 --> 01:52:48.280
don't fucking get them both of the shit that they fucking record is ridiculous

01:52:48.280 --> 01:52:51.900
maybe we can get sure me to hey maybe we can buy the gaming podcast or another

01:52:51.900 --> 01:53:01.340
game fight because the gaming Guinness World Records think well we haven't

01:53:01.340 --> 01:53:05.300
started talking about the tester yet I did watch episode 2 of the tester oh was

01:53:05.300 --> 01:53:11.340
it worth a Shermie poop yes I still feel the same about it it's you know it's not

01:53:11.340 --> 01:53:15.980
the most terrible thing to ever reach my television but it's no RuPaul's Drag

01:53:15.980 --> 01:53:20.380
Race which would be the best thing to ever grace my television it's it's a big

01:53:20.380 --> 01:53:28.220
what the fuck ever it's a three out of five through Paul drag races um it

01:53:28.220 --> 01:53:32.700
should have to lip-sync for its life I do think that is something I don't know

01:53:32.700 --> 01:53:35.820
it's pretty obvious that they fucking film this whole show in the scope of

01:53:35.820 --> 01:53:39.260
like three or four days like like they're doing a little challenge in the

01:53:39.260 --> 01:53:42.700
morning kick somebody off to a challenge in the evening kick somebody off to it

01:53:42.700 --> 01:53:51.140
was really fucking fast I'm sure whatever just as $5,000 dude I'd go on

01:53:51.140 --> 01:53:54.420
the tech like if it's just like four days or whatever to film the show I'd

01:53:54.420 --> 01:54:02.420
fucking go on the tester win the $5,000 and then quit fuck you I'm out of here

01:54:02.420 --> 01:54:08.540
all right I'm not gonna be a fucking tester you'll pay shit there if they

01:54:08.540 --> 01:54:11.340
were willing to pay I'm not gonna say what I make of my current job now but if

01:54:11.340 --> 01:54:14.180
they're willing to match that I do it although I don't know like if they had

01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:20.460
it I gotta be fucking honest if instead the competition was like be the new host

01:54:20.460 --> 01:54:25.020
of PlayStation shows or something like that I would give that some serious

01:54:25.020 --> 01:54:28.020
fucking thought because I'd be like oh I could get do something I really like for

01:54:28.020 --> 01:54:33.420
a living that might be worth it you know money don't buy everything I think if

01:54:33.420 --> 01:54:37.100
the contest were be the next fucking PlayStation host of fucking yeah ever

01:54:37.100 --> 01:54:40.340
they would probably have like I just like be the spokesperson for something

01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:45.500
and I'd you know compete in that and win and then the surprise at the end by the

01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:51.700
way you get to be a spokesperson for Apple god damn it Bo fuck you it to call

01:54:51.700 --> 01:54:54.940
one our chat room chat that orange laundry calm said episode four of the

01:54:54.940 --> 01:54:59.660
tester is supposed to be larping oh god that's gonna be awesome oh well I'm only

01:54:59.660 --> 01:55:04.900
through the second episode I just watched it in you know waste time people

01:55:04.900 --> 01:55:11.140
who were doing the live-action avatar roleplay themselves blue and they were

01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:14.580
legit they've got a website in a group in everything I have fucking heard about

01:55:14.580 --> 01:55:20.300
these people that that are depressed after they watch fucking avatar because

01:55:20.300 --> 01:55:24.540
they they want to fucking live on Pandora like it's fucking real okay I

01:55:24.540 --> 01:55:28.740

01:55:28.740 --> 01:55:34.460
woods acting stupid we just ran around downtown mobile acting stupid all right

01:55:34.460 --> 01:55:37.820
let's move on with some more fucking gaming news then the mailbag then your

01:55:37.820 --> 01:55:41.060
fucking calls which I'm sure are gonna be a hoot and a holler tonight can't

01:55:41.060 --> 01:55:45.660
fucking wait for that remember every call counts all right we might have to

01:55:45.660 --> 01:55:48.700
institute the time limit on calls tonight I think we're gonna do that I

01:55:48.700 --> 01:55:52.260
think we're gonna do rapid-fire calls tonight just so everybody can have their

01:55:52.260 --> 01:55:55.620
say because I know everybody wants to get a rapid-fire call everyone gives a

01:55:55.620 --> 01:56:00.260
fuck rapid-fire calls tonight I'm already too long we hang up on you know

01:56:00.260 --> 01:56:03.220
what though instead of getting three calls we could get through like seven if

01:56:03.220 --> 01:56:08.780
we do a time limit so we're gonna do that tonight all right uh Loki some

01:56:08.780 --> 01:56:12.420
fucking gaming news for us this also has nothing to fucking do with the

01:56:12.420 --> 01:56:16.180
PlayStation Network going well the PlayStation are technically didn't go

01:56:16.180 --> 01:56:22.340
down but you know PlayStation 3 is it way back in late 2008 apparently a

01:56:22.340 --> 01:56:27.580
Pennsylvania teenager playing SOCOM US Navy SEALs got kicked out of a

01:56:27.580 --> 01:56:32.960
tournament for using a cheat mod so he decided to take revenge by crashing the

01:56:32.960 --> 01:56:39.080
PlayStation website for 11 days and what's funny though is Sony has decided

01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:46.460
you know what they filed a federal grand jury investigation which led to the

01:56:46.460 --> 01:56:53.060
perpetrator getting arrested the hacker pled guilty to four felony charges in

01:56:53.060 --> 01:56:59.540
juvie court and apparently he got access he said he apparently got access to the

01:56:59.540 --> 01:57:04.140
site servers and let loose a virus that brought everything down and his methods

01:57:04.140 --> 01:57:09.160
I guess weren't described but some experts or whatever contacted by local

01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:13.700
TV station said they were so sophisticated that someone else couldn't

01:57:13.700 --> 01:57:20.660
pull it off hopefully by now they've already fixed that stuff apparently also

01:57:20.660 --> 01:57:26.720
it says in exchange the team pleaded guilty the four counts and lawful use of

01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:30.780
a computer criminal use of computer computer trespassing and distribution of

01:57:30.780 --> 01:57:35.180
a computer virus in exchange for a process prosecutors dropping the 11

01:57:35.180 --> 01:57:43.620
others some related to the March 2009 cyber-attack that's funny no team

01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:49.100
funnier is he's from La Trobe which we have a road over here named La Trobe but

01:57:49.100 --> 01:57:52.180
this is all Pittsburgh new Pennsylvania I actually know where that is in

01:57:52.180 --> 01:57:55.220
Pennsylvania not just Pittsburgh but what they're talking about well you know

01:57:55.220 --> 01:57:58.780
boo-fucking-hoo for this kid he got what he deserved honestly you know she

01:57:58.780 --> 01:58:02.260
didn't hack the website kicked out you got kicked out for fucking cheating you

01:58:02.260 --> 01:58:07.620

01:58:07.620 --> 01:58:16.660
cheating when have fun in the fucking slammer on to happier news a really

01:58:16.660 --> 01:58:21.540

doesn't love little big planet it's so fucking adorable lots of people do

01:58:25.580 --> 01:58:32.140
apparently enough to make two million two million user creators pretty fun

01:58:32.140 --> 01:58:38.140
stuff on there there's some levels that were like really difficult levels I

01:58:38.140 --> 01:58:41.820
forget what they're called though but oh man we were busting up there like on

01:58:41.820 --> 01:58:47.020
some of the top rated user levels just go through playing those there's some

01:58:47.020 --> 01:58:52.140
really funny fucking levels on there and this shouldn't really come as a big

01:58:52.140 --> 01:58:57.140
fucking surprise but Media Molecule has now been absorbed fully as a first party

01:58:57.140 --> 01:59:02.220
company for Sony so Sony is now suck them up into their collective and Media

01:59:02.220 --> 01:59:06.460
Molecule now has their fucking check signed by Sony so there it is

01:59:06.460 --> 01:59:12.460
it's Dan Media Molecule is no longer an independent studio and by the way a

01:59:12.460 --> 01:59:16.380
comment from Michael Denny the senior vice president of Sony worldwide studios

01:59:16.380 --> 01:59:21.940
quote Media Molecule will simply continue to make great games welcoming

01:59:21.940 --> 01:59:25.220
Media Molecule into the PlayStation family will allow us to better support

01:59:25.220 --> 01:59:29.740
their future titles and ambitions they're really fucked now just kidding I

01:59:29.740 --> 01:59:35.420
added that last part myself all right and Dan yelled from the living room

01:59:35.420 --> 01:59:39.300
that's only if Activision buys them boy if Activision comes for your company

01:59:39.300 --> 01:59:46.380
run bitch run I can't say me I can't wait for them to close Blizzard that'll

01:59:46.380 --> 01:59:53.940
be the day dark soccer would you got for us well yeah there was a version of a

01:59:53.940 --> 01:59:59.220
number of different Nintendo games some of them super rare that were going on

01:59:59.220 --> 02:00:07.500
eBay there was one in particular family fun fitness stadium events it hit a bid

02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:15.500
amount of eight hundred thousand two hundred dollars fucking eBay yeah

02:00:15.500 --> 02:00:20.580
scammers you'd like anybody who has that much money to blow on an NES game which

02:00:20.580 --> 02:00:26.740
is actually the highest game on there right now is bubble bath babes with the

02:00:26.740 --> 02:00:31.300
box for two thousand nine hundred and ninety five dollars and let me say every

02:00:31.300 --> 02:00:36.940
fucking penny I'll offer what I'll offer a one cent bid on it I don't think you

02:00:36.940 --> 02:00:41.860
can put a one cent bid when you have to do three thousand best offer five bucks

02:00:41.860 --> 02:00:47.020
only off topic here just thought I'd mention this because it's not fucking

02:00:47.020 --> 02:00:51.940
allowed okay well this is going back to the fucking sir we had about during

02:00:51.940 --> 02:00:57.380
rapid-fire about the Ubisoft DRM here's why their server went down do the

02:00:57.380 --> 02:01:02.420
exceptional demand we're currently expert experiencing difficulties yes

02:01:02.420 --> 02:01:06.500
that's right because their games sold and people bought them and then try to

02:01:06.500 --> 02:01:11.660
play them and it logs in online it caused server strain and therefore it's

02:01:11.660 --> 02:01:16.260
not work so basically if you buy their games it breaks the server why don't

02:01:16.260 --> 02:01:19.620
they just fucking say it's a DDoS attack because that's clearly what's going on

02:01:19.620 --> 02:01:24.700
right it's not it's just from people playing their games don't you think

02:01:24.700 --> 02:01:29.380
that's just a blow to bullshit just know it's a face if they're just stupid

02:01:29.380 --> 02:01:33.500
exceptional demand could be a bunch of inquiries to their server I think they're

02:01:33.500 --> 02:01:39.020
being DDoSed which isn't okay I think that's fucked up like I don't think it's

02:01:39.020 --> 02:01:43.740
even worse if that's the case oh dude the exceptional demand well that will be

02:01:43.740 --> 02:01:49.260
a problem going forward okay I would you don't fucking take all these statements

02:01:49.260 --> 02:01:52.820
at face value though because look at what Sony said earlier this week we fix

02:01:52.820 --> 02:01:56.580
the fucking date problem no you didn't you waited it out you fucking waited it

02:01:56.580 --> 02:01:59.860
out and then put out a press release about how fucking awesome you are to

02:01:59.860 --> 02:02:06.420
fix the problem in exactly 24 hours come on we weren't born yesterday due to

02:02:06.420 --> 02:02:18.060
exceptional demand you know what your your fucking DRM is about as in demand

02:02:18.060 --> 02:02:22.820
as a fucking Yanni CD at Lollapalooza okay that's how fucking in demand your

02:02:22.820 --> 02:02:34.980
thing is anyhow more news than the mailbag that's just funny oh sorry so this

02:02:34.980 --> 02:02:39.020
is kind of cool rock band network finally launched in rock band network

02:02:39.020 --> 02:02:44.500
you may remember is kind of an extension of the XNA where anybody that has a

02:02:44.500 --> 02:02:49.340
membership to the XNA can basically download the tools that they need to

02:02:49.340 --> 02:02:54.380
convert their music into rock band tracks and then you can go ahead and

02:02:54.380 --> 02:03:02.140
sell them online well they launched with 105 songs which is fucking awesome try

02:03:02.140 --> 02:03:08.780
that guitar hero seriously or DJ hero don't even get me started DJ hero to

02:03:08.780 --> 02:03:13.940
download packs yeah I should have figured no but seriously compared this

02:03:13.940 --> 02:03:18.020
to what they have for you know it's our hero where they have their basic service

02:03:18.020 --> 02:03:23.020
you can create your own tracks and throw them on there for free download but this

02:03:23.020 --> 02:03:30.100
is like way better and 105 tracks launch so far the song ranges from price ranges

02:03:30.100 --> 02:03:35.180
are about 80 to 160 Microsoft points or a buck or two and you know just kind of

02:03:35.180 --> 02:03:40.180
some of the artists that are on here that I thought were pretty cool flogging

02:03:40.180 --> 02:03:44.380
Molly's on here with drunken lullabies the live version and requiem for a dying

02:03:44.380 --> 02:03:52.420

of Jonathan Colton in there including creepy doll IKEA in the future soon

02:04:08.740 --> 02:04:14.100
another two bunch of good songs and then you know a bunch of other artists I

02:04:14.100 --> 02:04:19.460
don't recognize what a lot of other people might was it the shins Australia

02:04:19.460 --> 02:04:26.980
I recognize the shins there's some other artists the main drag see here scratching

02:04:26.980 --> 02:04:34.020
the itch whatever but tons of stuff and there's gonna be more added each day as

02:04:34.020 --> 02:04:39.820
you know this goes on definitely worth checking out they are exclusive on the

02:04:39.820 --> 02:04:45.140
xbox 360 for 30 days after which a selection of standout tracks will become

02:04:45.140 --> 02:04:51.140
available on the PlayStation 3 and the week I think a well our should have a

02:04:51.140 --> 02:04:53.980
fucking song on there like I don't know we don't really have any we don't do

02:04:53.980 --> 02:05:01.660
music really but I I think we should just we should have a fuck it's not an

02:05:01.660 --> 02:05:05.580
original song yeah we have to come up with an OL our original song do we know

02:05:05.580 --> 02:05:08.900
any fucking songwriters that could write us a fucking song that we just scream

02:05:08.900 --> 02:05:14.020
the lyrics to over some like type of music I guess I have some type of guitar

02:05:14.020 --> 02:05:18.220
thing they can play like an epic guitar solo and a drum solo that we could all

02:05:18.220 --> 02:05:21.660
sing come on does you guys wanna fucking sing a song on Rock Band Network can't

02:05:21.660 --> 02:05:27.260
maybe not it's just we cost a lot take a lot of time I'm not that talented all

02:05:27.260 --> 02:05:30.580
right if someone wants to put all that effort and work into it yeah sure I got

02:05:30.580 --> 02:05:33.580
one more story for you guys and then we can get to the fucking mailbag this has

02:05:33.580 --> 02:05:36.220
to do with an update to the code of conduct I gotta be honest although I'm

02:05:36.220 --> 02:05:39.420
sure this probably pissed me off when I first fucking heard about it I totally

02:05:39.420 --> 02:05:43.740
fucking forgot about it until this story came out this week that apparently Xbox

02:05:43.740 --> 02:05:49.180
Live has now lifted the ban on using the terms lesbian gay bi transgender and

02:05:49.180 --> 02:05:54.100
straight in your profiles so if you want to put hi I like games and I'm a big

02:05:54.100 --> 02:05:59.540
lesbian in your profile it is okay to do that now so have a ball and I talked a

02:05:59.540 --> 02:06:02.660
little bit about this on Bobby Black Wolf show tonight you know he's the show

02:06:02.660 --> 02:06:06.180
before us at all games radio he's a much cleaner show than we are by the way he

02:06:06.180 --> 02:06:10.620
is always kind enough to do a call with us and I was coming on how fucking like

02:06:10.620 --> 02:06:14.460
you know I want to see Bobby I want to see Bobby do a fuck show man I want to

02:06:14.460 --> 02:06:20.220
see him just go off one night sound like a Bobby unhinged although he well he

02:06:20.220 --> 02:06:23.340
swears on his other show Friday night gaming but you know that's such a video

02:06:23.340 --> 02:06:27.140
show that there's a lot of pause that you like if you're listening to it as a

02:06:27.140 --> 02:06:29.540
radio show there's a lot of pauses because they're doing things on video

02:06:29.540 --> 02:06:33.260
they're playing games and stuff it makes sense I just like to see Bobby just just

02:06:33.260 --> 02:06:37.780
go off for an hour like I can't fucking believe this fucking I'd love it awesome

02:06:37.780 --> 02:06:41.860
anyway I'm Bobby Shaw I was talking about this a little bit and I was just

02:06:41.860 --> 02:06:46.140
saying like you know okay yeah I'm a I'm a gay guy and I I don't think I really

02:06:46.140 --> 02:06:50.300
care that I can put this in my profile now especially on Xbox Live of all

02:06:50.300 --> 02:06:56.180
places I don't want to put like I'm a gay gamer 31 from California like it's

02:06:56.180 --> 02:07:03.140
not fucking match.com or whatever it's business why do people make that

02:09:57.300 --> 02:10:04.340
Christmas Christmas card with um a sudoku puzzle in it and um isn't it

02:10:04.340 --> 02:10:08.380
fucking March and you're just now getting a Christmas no he I got it it

02:10:08.380 --> 02:10:14.940
bounced back so yeah and um and um and um he sent like I think and I have

02:10:14.940 --> 02:10:19.140
judgment card or something anyway um here was a situation posed to me and I

02:10:19.140 --> 02:10:22.900
wanted to get all our thoughts on this since we are all about the same age

02:10:22.900 --> 02:10:28.740
here's the scenario my coworker gave me Dave and my other co-workers would put

02:10:28.740 --> 02:10:31.940
the money into a pot in order to win the pot I would have to stop playing all

02:10:31.940 --> 02:10:35.860
video games for a month I told him I would not do it and then it seemed a bit

02:10:35.860 --> 02:10:39.260
ridiculous to me Dave's reasoning was that my life would get immediately

02:10:39.260 --> 02:10:42.420
better and that I would be a better person and go out more the ironic thing

02:10:42.420 --> 02:10:46.340
was that we were dragged out to a country bar and shooting pool which I

02:10:46.340 --> 02:10:51.580
did not enjoy as much but I could do I think we were all met anyways being

02:10:51.580 --> 02:10:56.140
dragged there also like many others he seems he sees the gaming lifestyle as

02:10:56.140 --> 02:11:01.540
negative and he does not know even really what me like many others not in

02:11:01.540 --> 02:11:08.180
Idaho okay I do a large amount of gaming everything from Beatles rock band on

02:11:08.180 --> 02:11:11.620
360 to World of Warcraft but I balance this out with my weekly workouts

02:11:11.620 --> 02:11:17.060
including DDR and my other grown-up things quotes I am NOT a poop soccer okay

02:11:17.060 --> 02:11:21.780
I believe that it is what makes us individuals to be different and that we

02:11:21.780 --> 02:11:26.140
can have different hobbies and interests different than others to enjoy life some

02:11:26.140 --> 02:11:29.260
of the activities that people think are normal drinking playing pool partying I

02:11:29.260 --> 02:11:33.820
have not done but I feel empty doing them even with others I would rather not

02:11:33.820 --> 02:11:37.580
conform and do what I enjoy by myself then to feel empty so what do you guys

02:11:37.580 --> 02:11:41.260
think is there anything else I should say to him to back up my point by the

02:11:41.260 --> 02:11:45.220
way in Idaho most what most consider normal is all outdoorsy stuff floating

02:11:45.220 --> 02:11:49.020
river hiking camping BSU football hunting I'm not from Idaho I'm a

02:11:49.020 --> 02:11:52.900
Floridian this email has been brought to you by red Robin the home of the

02:11:52.900 --> 02:11:57.060
delicious chop house burger now I'm fucking hungry for one of those Western

02:11:57.060 --> 02:12:02.700
chicken we went to federal records today I ate an ostrich burger yummy fucking

02:12:02.700 --> 02:12:08.260
delicious anyway um well first of all I know a lot of Floridians I lived about

02:12:08.260 --> 02:12:11.420
an hour from Pensacola and a lot of them were back were right very well rednecks

02:12:11.420 --> 02:12:16.260
um so yeah all the same stuff you know what just tell them like you know flat

02:12:16.260 --> 02:12:25.420
out say I'm an individual this is I'm not going to change myself to please you

02:12:25.420 --> 02:12:30.860
if he's your fucking friend he should understand that there's some fucking

02:12:30.860 --> 02:12:34.500
things whatever I mean it's hanging out going to country bars he's a friend of

02:12:34.500 --> 02:12:37.540
some some sort if he's your fucking friend you should understand there are

02:12:37.540 --> 02:12:40.980
things you like to do you're not hurting anyone playing a video game you're not

02:12:40.980 --> 02:12:45.540
doing nothing but playing video games you're holding down a steady job it's

02:12:45.540 --> 02:12:49.940
not anyone's place to tell another person how to live their life end of

02:12:49.940 --> 02:12:56.140
story that's all I think if you know what though I think here's here's my

02:12:56.140 --> 02:13:01.100
fucking suggestion if you're gonna do that for him he should play a video game

02:13:01.100 --> 02:13:05.700
with you and see what it is that you enjoy so much about video games I think

02:13:05.700 --> 02:13:09.220
if you're gonna do that and go to a country bar which props to you because I

02:13:09.220 --> 02:13:12.260
don't know how long I could stand something like that but I would do it

02:13:12.260 --> 02:13:15.040
for a friend if a friend really wanted me to go to a country bar for a night I

02:13:15.040 --> 02:13:18.980
would go but I think in return you should ask he should sit down play a

02:13:18.980 --> 02:13:22.540
video game with you and try to find a game that you think he might like I mean

02:13:22.540 --> 02:13:26.660
you know your friend better than I do you might find that new Super Mario

02:13:26.660 --> 02:13:30.780
Brothers Wii is a game or maybe Call of Duty modern warfare is the game up to

02:13:30.780 --> 02:13:36.660
you my friend but if this guy's really your friend like he should just take you

02:13:36.660 --> 02:13:39.940
as you are even if he's just a co-worker then if he's a co-worker then you get

02:13:39.940 --> 02:13:43.500
this whole other thing involved where if he's it's to the point where he's

02:13:43.500 --> 02:13:47.880
annoying you you have every right home stop talking to you honestly like then

02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:51.500
again that only really works in California I yeah I mean I would hate

02:13:51.500 --> 02:13:56.700
that you would have to go that far with it honestly just encourage him to be

02:13:56.700 --> 02:13:59.660
more open-minded and just let him know hey there's nothing wrong with video

02:13:59.660 --> 02:14:05.520
games dude call a modern warfare made more money than most Hollywood movies do

02:14:05.520 --> 02:14:09.900
I mean it is an art form I don't know I don't know this guy maybe follow fancy

02:14:09.900 --> 02:14:16.100
13 and the stories would maybe maybe plays the deer hunter I don't know which

02:14:16.100 --> 02:14:20.460
that game is actually kind of funny um so anyway next fucking email dear olr I

02:14:20.460 --> 02:14:24.500
finished heavy rain last Sunday I wasn't affected by the ps3 clock glitch and was

02:14:24.500 --> 02:14:33.460
able to beat sorry beat off to and beat heavy rain with no problem at all Oh

02:14:33.460 --> 02:14:38.620
special person to me heavy rain is comparable to a show like rescue me mad

02:14:38.620 --> 02:14:43.820
men and burn notice but notice is pretty cool damn like to rescue me um these are

02:14:43.820 --> 02:14:48.220
shows that would have been absolutely dull to me when I was young teenager but

02:14:48.220 --> 02:14:52.460
really deep and compelling now that I have matured into more adult tastes do

02:14:52.460 --> 02:14:58.860
you feel the same way they're not shows that I enjoy but I see why people like

02:14:58.860 --> 02:15:02.540
them I mean like I said Dan loves rescue me I like Dennis Leary I mean I think

02:15:02.540 --> 02:15:08.100
he's pretty hilarious I watched the end of nip tuck this week it went out with a

02:15:08.100 --> 02:15:13.780
fizzle hmm it was just like there's like and we give up it was basically kind of

02:15:13.780 --> 02:15:18.100
I was really upset because there was no new RuPaul's drag race this week but

02:15:18.100 --> 02:15:21.100
there was a new project runway and I completely agreed with who they sent

02:15:21.100 --> 02:15:27.420
home is that what we're talking about I think it's talking about serious dramas

02:15:27.420 --> 02:15:30.660
dealing with the issues that people don't like to talk about I think there

02:15:30.660 --> 02:15:35.900
are certainly some shows I didn't really watch as a kid that I could fucking

02:15:35.900 --> 02:15:39.020
appreciate a little more now that maybe I couldn't appreciate because I was too

02:15:39.020 --> 02:15:42.420
young to understand I'm sure there were shows like that I can't think of

02:15:42.420 --> 02:15:45.060
anything off the top of my head but there's a few shows though that that

02:15:45.060 --> 02:15:48.740
grow up with you if you know what I mean like watching freaking Rocky and

02:15:48.740 --> 02:15:53.700
Bullwinkle or Beverly Hills 90210 I mean I can't watch that new one it's such

02:15:53.700 --> 02:15:58.100
bullshit compared to the old one I did I fucking grew up with Brandon and Brenda

02:15:58.100 --> 02:16:04.700
I mean they're my homeboys sorry I thought she was on the show now I think

02:16:04.700 --> 02:16:07.780
she did like a guest thing but it's not the same because now she's gonna be on

02:16:07.780 --> 02:16:14.620
the show yeah some of them are on the show there was one I watched God I

02:16:14.620 --> 02:16:19.540
watched some weird TV when I'm at home sometimes I watched this show

02:16:19.540 --> 02:16:24.540
overhauling it's basically one of those you know they take a car and soup it up

02:16:24.540 --> 02:16:36.380
type shows and they did one for what's his name in I remember the guy's name on

02:16:36.380 --> 02:16:42.980
90210 yeah he is hearing in searing why do I know that yeah they did his uh I'm

02:16:42.980 --> 02:16:46.380
silently hitting my head in shame he was on Dancing with the Stars I think that

02:16:46.380 --> 02:16:50.780
yeah that's where they all finish reading email yeah yeah yeah also I need

02:16:50.780 --> 02:16:54.540
help with DJ hero I seem to be unable to perform the blue button scratch

02:16:54.540 --> 02:16:58.400
consistently and effectively it doesn't matter which hand I use or whether the

02:16:58.400 --> 02:17:02.020
buttons are on the left or right of the turntable controller I fail on the

02:17:02.020 --> 02:17:06.740
consistent basis are there any tips you can give me Loki I'm surprised it's the

02:17:06.740 --> 02:17:10.140
blue one that you're having trouble with that's the one that is on the inside of

02:17:10.140 --> 02:17:13.660
camera well what kind of surprises me is that he has the same problem even if he

02:17:13.660 --> 02:17:16.820
flips through the first thing I would have said is play left-handed mode it's

02:17:16.820 --> 02:17:20.600
probably inside one I'm guessing because it's hard to get a grip on it what you

02:17:20.600 --> 02:17:24.300
need to do is when you have your hand on the actual turntable is I normally put

02:17:24.300 --> 02:17:29.340
my thumb I rest my thumb on the outside on the actual edge of the turntable and

02:17:29.340 --> 02:17:33.460
use that to kind of move the turntable because if you just rely on you know the

02:17:33.460 --> 02:17:37.140
friction of your finger on that button it's not gonna work you have to keep

02:17:37.140 --> 02:17:41.900
your thumb held down to create that kind of like friction there or it's too loose

02:17:41.900 --> 02:17:45.660
and you'll get all these scratches you don't really want you have to use your

02:17:45.660 --> 02:17:49.380
thumb to I think that attraction that's where your problem comes in but maybe

02:17:49.380 --> 02:17:51.780
like I'm afraid we're gonna get a follow-up email like I'm already doing

02:17:51.780 --> 02:17:55.060
that well then you just need practice more you might just have to take down

02:17:55.060 --> 02:17:59.820
honestly take down the difficulty you might be playing on two I I think maybe

02:17:59.820 --> 02:18:02.900
you're me I don't know I'm guessing what I've been a longtime fan of Bahmani so

02:18:02.900 --> 02:18:05.620
you're trying to take it a little more aggressive I've been doing this but I

02:18:05.620 --> 02:18:10.540
haven't done it yet I've been meaning to take like aggressively it's an adverb

02:18:10.540 --> 02:18:15.920
whatever I don't like adverbs oh yeah we'll fuck you back we need to take like

02:18:15.920 --> 02:18:21.140
a metal plate or something like that and find the actual dead zones on each side

02:18:21.140 --> 02:18:24.500
you know whatever because there's little dead zones where you can actually move

02:18:24.500 --> 02:18:27.740
the marker and it'll finally move all the way over to the left and right and

02:18:27.740 --> 02:18:32.060
just put a plate there so that basically it's just all Center unless you go far

02:18:32.060 --> 02:18:36.260
right far left because I hate it where you just don't go far enough or

02:18:36.260 --> 02:18:40.500
something like that it doesn't register so that'd be kind of cool fucking play

02:18:40.500 --> 02:18:44.060
DJ hero in a while I really need to I'm kind of disappointed price of them at

02:18:44.060 --> 02:18:47.340
fries they have a ton of them I'm really fucking disappointed they didn't support

02:18:47.340 --> 02:18:51.580
it better with more DLC that's two download packs they are not trying at

02:18:51.580 --> 02:18:55.460
all there we release a couple now we're gonna release a new game they better

02:19:46.340 --> 02:19:49.300
manager for game crazy in Colorado and I think it would be interesting to hear

02:19:49.300 --> 02:19:52.260
the opinions and thoughts on what's going on especially coming from someone

02:19:52.260 --> 02:19:55.980
who works in a different district and region personally I am very concerned of

02:19:55.980 --> 02:19:58.460
what's going on and it would be interesting to chat about it on your

02:19:58.460 --> 02:20:03.380
show please do not use my name for obvious reasons but peas do respond I

02:20:03.380 --> 02:20:06.900

02:20:38.140 --> 02:20:43.820
they also did get to hear my Dan voice but I can understand though if you don't

02:20:43.820 --> 02:20:47.260
want to fucking talk about it cuz it's a fucking day job but you know you don't

02:20:47.260 --> 02:20:50.940
want to put that shit at risk so I would completely fucking understand if the

02:20:50.940 --> 02:20:57.540
answer is no fucking comment well we can ask him so Dan a wild Dan has appeared

02:20:57.540 --> 02:21:02.900
we got an email from a listener in Colorado who is a game crazy manager and

02:21:02.900 --> 02:21:08.620
wants to know her him him and he wants to know what your thoughts are on it

02:21:08.620 --> 02:21:11.980
being from a different region if you want if you don't want to say anything

02:21:11.980 --> 02:21:16.180
on the show you don't have to about what about the closures and how you feel and

02:21:16.180 --> 02:21:24.580
about what might be happening being out of money sucks and stores closing sucks

02:21:24.580 --> 02:21:30.780
and if more of you fuckers would shop there instead of going to GameStop maybe

02:21:30.780 --> 02:21:36.700
we can stay no no it's not your guys's fault it's your guys's fault there's

02:21:36.700 --> 02:21:40.860
really not a lot to say you know the economy's tough a lot of good people

02:21:40.860 --> 02:21:46.860
have lost jobs a lot of good people are hanging on and Hollywood and movie

02:21:46.860 --> 02:21:55.820
gallery really mismanaged through that on a corporate level I've dealt with

02:21:55.820 --> 02:22:01.980
movie gallery and they're like exactly it's a company that like didn't catch on

02:22:01.980 --> 02:22:07.140
to trends that were stupidly obvious ten years ago that they could have done to

02:22:07.140 --> 02:22:12.180
avoid all this today and if you know if things have been done differently you

02:22:12.180 --> 02:22:15.180
know what it could have should have yeah yeah yeah you know as far as it goes now

02:22:15.180 --> 02:22:21.420
yeah it sucks that we're losing any competition for GameStop because

02:22:21.420 --> 02:22:26.060
GameStop's already bigger and evil er than it needs to be and that's you guys

02:22:26.060 --> 02:22:31.820
know that's true and that honestly enough that maybe if you know if if the

02:22:31.820 --> 02:22:35.900
bankruptcy works out which it won't and any of the game crazies end up staying

02:22:35.900 --> 02:22:40.340
open which they probably won't you know it would be really nice that the gamers

02:22:40.340 --> 02:22:45.580
will still have an alternative but you know to anyone else who works for the

02:22:45.580 --> 02:22:49.780
company hey I'm there with you it's rough I can't speak for them I'm gonna

02:22:49.780 --> 02:22:54.220
show up every day I mean you know try to help my gamers and you know I recommend

02:22:54.220 --> 02:22:58.420
they do the same if you have a game craze in your area and you haven't gone

02:22:58.420 --> 02:23:04.500
there hey this is it while it's there give it a chance and you know hopefully

02:23:04.500 --> 02:23:09.720
like it and if you don't go to hell maybe we should maybe we should do an

02:23:09.720 --> 02:23:15.000
SOS campaign save our stores well I appreciate Dan's perspective because you

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.580
know there's some people that when it comes to the day job they'd be like I

02:23:17.580 --> 02:23:19.940
fucking touching that shit with a fucking ten-foot pole so I appreciate

02:23:19.940 --> 02:23:25.900
you sweetie being openly and candidly on the topic thank you sweetie support not

02:23:25.900 --> 02:23:29.260
just independent radio but support independent game stores even though game

02:23:29.260 --> 02:23:32.640
crazy isn't necessarily independent it's important to point out they're not

02:23:32.640 --> 02:23:37.440
Walmart and they're not GameStop so that's independent enough they're a

02:23:37.440 --> 02:23:40.620
fucking endangered species yes that's right they're like they're like a

02:23:40.620 --> 02:23:44.740

we already talked about they bought portal at Circuit City RAP when it was

02:24:38.980 --> 02:24:42.940
released a la carte I'll have to see what's all about viral marketing in its

02:24:42.940 --> 02:24:47.980
best dude orange box is only like $19.99 now right like it's really fun seriously

02:24:47.980 --> 02:24:52.300
what a fucking steal if you have an Xbox 360 or PC or whatever it's a good deal I

02:24:52.300 --> 02:24:58.180
really wish I am getting the game it's great I just didn't play it a lot moved

02:25:10.180 --> 02:25:14.540
curious you know whatever you can read on the show obviously mail bag at orange

02:25:14.540 --> 02:25:18.300
launch rated calm if you want to send us some fucking emails meanwhile it's time

02:25:18.300 --> 02:25:22.060
to do the F use of the week oh yeah we're still having them tonight just

02:25:22.060 --> 02:25:27.820
because it's a fuck show doesn't mean we've got orange boxes is 1999 1799 news

02:25:27.820 --> 02:25:32.620
we got a big story to inspire this tonight

02:25:39.900 --> 02:25:43.660
as if the whole fucking reason for tonight's show weren't enough reason to

02:25:43.660 --> 02:25:48.060
be angry let me give you a little something extra here a Korean couple

02:25:48.060 --> 02:25:53.140
this week has made the news for neglecting their infant to the point

02:25:53.140 --> 02:25:58.860
where the infant starved because they were addicted to online games at

02:25:58.860 --> 02:26:02.580
internet cafes now you might want to take this with a grain of salt because

02:26:02.580 --> 02:26:07.980
it's coming from the Sun but still sadly you could see it but I trust the Sun

02:26:07.980 --> 02:26:12.140
with all of its sunlight in nutrients here's the irony they were raising a

02:26:12.140 --> 02:26:17.100
virtual toddler in a game called Prius online it's pretty much second life but

02:26:17.100 --> 02:26:20.620
while they were doing this they'd leave their real one at home alone each day

02:26:20.620 --> 02:26:23.420
with just a bottle of milk for nourishment dude it's even worse than

02:26:23.420 --> 02:26:27.900
Clara from the guild at least like she's sitting in the same room with them one

02:26:27.900 --> 02:26:31.220
day they came home to find the child dead and called the cops claiming that

02:26:31.220 --> 02:26:35.780
they found them dead went to found the kid dead when they woke up

02:26:35.780 --> 02:26:40.340
investigators found though that the child was dehydrated and decided that

02:26:40.340 --> 02:26:44.260
the couple story was full of bullshit good for them just pathetic this is all

02:26:44.260 --> 02:26:52.140
disgusting honestly yeah I what else can you say this is just it's it's kind of

02:26:52.140 --> 02:26:55.980
sad you don't have to take an IQ test to reproduce like some days I really wish

02:26:55.980 --> 02:27:00.860
you had to take an IQ test in order to successfully have an orgasm oh I'm

02:27:00.860 --> 02:27:09.460
almost there I'm almost there okay what's 2 plus 2 die forget no baby

02:27:09.460 --> 02:27:13.620
anyhow if that doesn't inspire some angst within you then I don't know what

02:27:13.620 --> 02:27:17.300
else well dark soccer what's your F use of the week fuck you ever hacked my Gaia

02:27:17.300 --> 02:27:26.620
account um yeah I had about a million and cold stolen and some of my expensive

02:27:26.620 --> 02:27:31.900
items and yeah I play on it as sort of like a little oh I'm wasting time thing

02:27:31.900 --> 02:27:36.500
but it's just that it's just shitty you know and I want people to give me my

02:27:36.500 --> 02:27:43.020
money back so it's just completely horrible that's really it though I mean

02:27:43.020 --> 02:27:45.540
that and having no time to get my stuff finished

02:27:45.540 --> 02:27:51.140
looky I'm tired so this isn't as heartfelt as it was the beginning of the

02:27:51.140 --> 02:27:58.340
show but fuck you to the asshole that stole my 360 and my mod chip and my $60

02:27:58.340 --> 02:28:04.580
that was gonna pay for installing the mod chip and wasting my entire day and

02:28:04.580 --> 02:28:08.620
making me have to drive down to Stockton because Stockton sucks and having to

02:28:08.620 --> 02:28:17.180
drive back from Stockton angry angry yes oh I was so pissed off and not only that

02:28:17.180 --> 02:28:21.540
waiting four hours in a car in front of an apartment complex which I assumed was

02:28:21.540 --> 02:28:27.140
his it might not be at this point I am going to email him this week though to

02:28:27.140 --> 02:28:30.540
give him a chance maybe there was some misunderstanding maybe his phone fucked

02:28:30.540 --> 02:28:35.540
up and he just didn't get any of my messages at the very end or maybe not or

02:28:35.540 --> 02:28:38.900
maybe not but hey I'm gonna give him an opportunity to ship me that console if

02:28:38.900 --> 02:28:42.140
he doesn't then we'll fucking post his email and his phone number all over the

02:28:42.140 --> 02:28:47.140
internet so good fucking luck yeah he has an iPhone I know that he pissed off

02:28:47.140 --> 02:28:51.820
a radio show host be warned I don't have a lot of F use this week I actually do

02:28:51.820 --> 02:28:54.500
have a big F you but it's not one I want to stay on the show because it's a

02:28:54.500 --> 02:29:01.100
sensitive matter so just F you to feeling underappreciated let's leave it

02:29:01.100 --> 02:29:08.300
at that that's it for the F use more fuck show a couple of fucking stories

02:29:08.300 --> 02:29:12.500
for you guys Loki what do you got on deck so apparently there's some fucking

02:29:12.500 --> 02:29:19.100
new design for the DS cartridge that's come out in a patent filing it looks

02:29:19.100 --> 02:29:22.940
like a new DS cartridge that's a little bit longer than the normal DS cartridge

02:29:22.940 --> 02:29:26.940
it's got I don't even know looks like almost like a button or something on the

02:29:26.940 --> 02:29:32.900
end of the cartridge there maybe either for like some sort of rewrite thing or

02:29:32.900 --> 02:29:39.180
possibly God knows if you ask me because it's hard to tell based just off this

02:29:39.180 --> 02:29:43.540
little picture but people are thinking that maybe it's some sort of expansion

02:29:43.540 --> 02:29:48.460
device that they're making for the DSI or something like that to allow you know

02:29:48.460 --> 02:29:53.340
other peripherals that you might use on say for example the Game Boy Advance

02:29:53.340 --> 02:29:59.140
slot like maybe new guitar hero type thing this makes me think of what is the

02:29:59.140 --> 02:30:03.740
rumble pack they put out for Pokemon pinball you know it kinda looks like to

02:30:03.740 --> 02:30:07.220
me almost like some sort of wireless card or something like that but the DS

02:30:07.220 --> 02:30:12.060
you already has wireless on it it's just that button on top you almost looks like

02:30:12.060 --> 02:30:17.980
a sinker some sort of device maybe a motion controller type thing something

02:30:17.980 --> 02:30:22.580
like that maybe the button resets you know the orientation or some shit like

02:30:22.580 --> 02:30:27.380
that who knows we'll find out later on it when this actually comes out whatever

02:30:27.380 --> 02:30:32.020
the hell it is that they're you know I don't know maybe around e3 sure it's

02:30:32.020 --> 02:30:38.420
gonna suck my fucking out why you gotta be so fucking negative we relax the Wii

02:30:38.420 --> 02:30:42.900
Vitality sensor mine that's why I gotta be fucking negative mine or the Wii

02:30:42.900 --> 02:30:47.260
Zapper hey let's let's make this really cool controller attachment nope now

02:30:47.260 --> 02:30:50.460
let's not let's just add a little plastic shell instead that looks like

02:30:50.460 --> 02:30:57.860
shit on plays like shit it is shit all right I got one more fucking story for

02:30:57.860 --> 02:31:01.180
you guys we're gonna open up the skype line a one eight seven seven game olr

02:31:01.180 --> 02:31:04.340
our username on skype is orange launch radio the three-minute rules in effect

02:31:04.340 --> 02:31:08.180
tonight phone calls will be limited to three minutes so that every fucking

02:31:08.180 --> 02:31:12.500
gamer can have a voice tonight valve games are on their way to the Macintosh

02:31:12.500 --> 02:31:17.300
that's right I guess there were some rumors about fucking steam going to the

02:31:17.300 --> 02:31:20.820
Macintosh cuz some fucking files that were found in the latest beta build but

02:31:20.820 --> 02:31:27.300
valve has basically hinted very strongly that the games are coming to the Mac I

02:31:27.300 --> 02:31:31.620
guess Doug Lombardi the VP of marketing over at valve actually kind of gave the

02:31:31.620 --> 02:31:37.540
official confirmation but no release dates or anything like that but it's a

02:31:37.540 --> 02:31:42.940
pretty fucking understood that Team Fortress 2 Half-Life Left 4 Dead portal

02:31:42.940 --> 02:31:47.060
those are all big big possibilities it should be noted Team Fortress 2 is used

02:31:47.060 --> 02:31:51.100
in some type of little campaign there that is kind of a parody of the Apple

02:31:51.100 --> 02:31:55.940
ads so some fucking Mac users are gonna be very fucking excited especially with

02:31:55.940 --> 02:31:58.680
a game like portal and you know all those games really valve makes some

02:31:58.680 --> 02:32:02.140
pretty fucking awesome games those are all gonna be worth playing yeah that's

02:32:02.140 --> 02:32:06.860
what's that they're pretty cool yep so even Loki can support that on the Mac

02:32:06.860 --> 02:32:10.780
more games for the Mac Loki that's all you ever wanted right I didn't want

02:32:10.780 --> 02:32:13.580
anything for the Mac and I don't care that's why they want to release more

02:32:13.580 --> 02:32:17.260
games to the Mac because there are people that buy those pcs I don't

02:32:17.260 --> 02:32:23.180
understand why but whatever you know make the money where they can I just

02:32:23.180 --> 02:32:26.660
want to share while Loki was reading his last fucking story I ran out to the

02:32:26.660 --> 02:32:29.300
fucking car by the way the Skype lines open go ahead and call one eight seven

02:32:29.300 --> 02:32:32.300
seven game all our I ran out to the fucking car to get more of these pita

02:32:32.300 --> 02:32:36.460
chips which you become really fucking addicted to but this is a different

02:32:36.460 --> 02:32:40.780
brand these are from Trader Joe's and these are reduced guilt because they're

02:32:40.780 --> 02:32:45.100
not as fatty sea salt chips and I've gotten Jamie addicted to them yay oh no

02:32:45.100 --> 02:32:49.220
I almost bought myself some not only is that the Stacy's brand is really good

02:32:49.220 --> 02:32:51.860
but these are really good too these are almost better in some ways and they have

02:32:51.860 --> 02:32:54.660
ones they have cinnamon and sugar ones at Trader Joe's too yes they do they

02:32:54.660 --> 02:32:58.780

fucking spazzinator it's been a long fucking time what's the latest with you

02:33:12.620 --> 02:33:21.020
and Sony well you know at least in my fucking opinion this whole clock you

02:33:21.020 --> 02:33:27.860
know fucking deal is you're putting another nail into the fucking coffin so

02:33:27.860 --> 02:33:35.020
you know it just seems like fucking so you can't do anything right so but on a

02:33:35.020 --> 02:33:42.740
positive note I did speak to Sony rep not too long ago and they gave me another

02:33:42.740 --> 02:33:49.940
story saying that yeah once I send my system in they'll you know if they have

02:34:55.780 --> 02:35:00.260

02:36:01.980 --> 02:36:05.900
pain in the ass why can't things just work why can't electronics just work you

02:36:05.900 --> 02:36:10.060

02:36:10.060 --> 02:36:13.760
minute stories to fucking get out there oh wait I got another call hold on one

02:36:13.760 --> 02:36:17.800
minute dark soccer I'll let you jump in right after this call you're on the

02:36:17.800 --> 02:36:22.360
Orange Lounge Radio fuck show who's this I was like a soccer who watching the

02:36:22.360 --> 02:36:29.700
Oscars and doing this at the same time fuck the Oscars bunch of sucking each

02:36:29.700 --> 02:36:33.140
other's dicks with these awards we all know it's gonna win doesn't fucking

02:36:33.140 --> 02:36:36.580
matter they bumped it up to ten movies it's a two-movie race anyway all right

02:36:36.580 --> 02:36:40.780
what's on your mind tonight I guess the the word fuck could probably apply to

02:36:40.780 --> 02:36:46.660
someone probably some entity deserves a case-to-point Activision ha ha yes our

02:36:46.660 --> 02:36:52.420
bad that happened recently what's your take on the whole fucking thing huh

02:36:52.420 --> 02:36:57.340
what's your take on the whole fucking thing um I think I knew it was it was on

02:36:57.340 --> 02:37:01.620
its way I think I knew was gonna happen it was a matter of when I mean the

02:37:01.620 --> 02:37:06.700
writing was on the wall when infinity Ward was you know actually nixed the

02:37:06.700 --> 02:37:10.980
dedicated servers modern warfare 2 you knew that is something that they

02:37:10.980 --> 02:37:16.580
probably didn't want to do but they had someone's hand probably forced them so

02:37:16.580 --> 02:37:24.420
it's kind of in other words the way I see it is that I don't know I guess

02:37:24.420 --> 02:37:30.260
Activision is trying to bring forth the you know the great video game crash that

02:37:30.260 --> 02:37:35.060
almost happened but never did are you talking about the one that happened in

02:37:35.060 --> 02:37:40.580
the 80s because that really didn't happen it just you know the way you see

02:37:40.580 --> 02:37:46.140
it is that you had you have a company that's um that's literally saturating

02:37:46.140 --> 02:37:50.300
the market basically trying to bleed everything you know try to get all their

02:37:50.300 --> 02:37:56.660
franchises dry and just like minimizing minimizing the amount of the amount of

02:37:56.660 --> 02:38:01.460
properties that I sustain them in other words if if it only comes down to Tony

02:38:01.460 --> 02:38:05.700
Hawk Hall of Duty Guitar Hero bringing bringing their only bird and butter

02:38:05.700 --> 02:38:08.940
that's kind of dangerous I don't know if it's gonna cause another fucking video

02:38:08.940 --> 02:38:14.020
game crash though I mean there's so many other reasons I mean you you get to the

02:38:14.020 --> 02:38:19.620
point where we're guitar heroes you know it's pretty much pan no matter what what

02:38:19.620 --> 02:38:22.220
new release comes out because they already know it's gonna be the same

02:38:22.220 --> 02:38:26.420
thing same dribble it's not gonna be worth the effort I mean the last to

02:38:26.420 --> 02:38:31.260
prove that point and when Tony Hawk you know Tony Hawk ride pretty much bombed

02:38:31.260 --> 02:38:35.660
for all intents and purposes it goes to show that they're they're not innovating

02:38:35.660 --> 02:38:39.020
we're just we're just releasing the same thing and trying to nickel and dime

02:38:39.020 --> 02:38:44.020
people no innovation more renovation I think they try to innovate it's just it

02:38:44.020 --> 02:38:49.020
sucked it's just the fact that they're not trying anything original like EA

02:38:49.020 --> 02:38:52.820
based EA learning they're there they learn their lesson already that's why

02:38:52.820 --> 02:38:57.980
so you see mirrors edge dead space Mass Effect because they're actually

02:38:57.980 --> 02:39:04.060
realizing that you can't you can't you can't milk the same same cow over and

02:39:04.060 --> 02:39:07.940
over and expect the the same result it just came down to where they they

02:39:07.940 --> 02:39:11.780
basically had their control system in place and it worked okay for Tony Hawk

02:39:11.780 --> 02:39:16.060
and then skate came out and had a slightly better control system that's

02:39:16.060 --> 02:39:21.140
where EA basically knew how to innovate they found they found a way to create a

02:39:21.140 --> 02:39:27.140
skateboarding game that was outside of the of the status quo outside of what

02:39:27.140 --> 02:39:32.980
what Tony Hawk is offered so you see right there when you when you feel to

02:39:32.980 --> 02:39:36.220
innovate the only thing you have is whatever you you know whatever you're

02:39:36.220 --> 02:39:40.300
able to market and whatever you're able to litigate all right I got to jump in

02:39:40.300 --> 02:39:42.740
and call time on the call because we're on three minute limit tonight but thank

02:39:42.740 --> 02:39:49.420
you Zaku as always for your perspective all right great night later we do

02:39:49.420 --> 02:39:53.020
appreciate Zaku's perspective and a gold fucking star for Zaku I did not hear much

02:39:53.020 --> 02:39:57.900
bam bam bamming on the keyboard and I heard little little taps but no worse

02:39:57.900 --> 02:40:03.900
than when Jamie points the mic at her keyboard all right love you mean it all

02:40:03.900 --> 02:40:06.820
right Jamie you had a last-minute story for us tonight speaking of which while

02:40:06.820 --> 02:40:10.380
we wait for another call at eight seven seven game olr on our fuck show I did

02:40:10.380 --> 02:40:15.980
and it was oh geez sounds awfully loud I didn't it was when actually that our

02:40:15.980 --> 02:40:20.580
good friend Martin left posted today and I thought it was really neat so I'm

02:40:20.580 --> 02:40:31.340
going to share it um there is a there was a report that is about a guy named

02:40:31.340 --> 02:40:38.340
Roy Williams who played through ocarina of time blindfolded to write a guide on

02:40:38.340 --> 02:40:47.340
how to play the game only by using using sound clues so that a visually impaired

02:40:47.340 --> 02:40:54.900
player could beat the game and so him and three other guys took two years to

02:40:54.900 --> 02:41:03.140
write this but Jordan Verner who was living in Ontario beat the game isn't

02:41:03.140 --> 02:41:08.460
that nice yeah that's it's cool and you know I know we have some blind gamers

02:41:08.460 --> 02:41:13.860
listen to this show that you know often kind of talk about you know using the

02:41:13.860 --> 02:41:16.860
kind of the sound cues in the games and being able to kind of play the games

02:41:16.860 --> 02:41:20.060
that way and I think that's cool that people kind of go out of their way to

02:41:20.060 --> 02:41:25.340
write things with sound cues and so forth and these FAQs so that everybody

02:41:25.340 --> 02:41:28.300
can really enjoy video games in one way or another so I think it's a great story

02:41:28.300 --> 02:41:32.660
okay we got more calls coming in sorry we've been ignoring the lines for a

02:41:32.660 --> 02:41:35.140
little bit but let's go to another call hi you're on the orange ons radio fuck

02:41:35.140 --> 02:41:39.540
show who's this it's about fucking time guys well really fucking sorry what's

02:41:39.540 --> 02:41:44.380
your fucking name my fucking name is Ron mo from the New York OL army fucker all

02:41:44.380 --> 02:41:47.660
right three fucking minutes what's on your fucking mind tonight dude I want to

02:41:47.660 --> 02:41:57.900
know what the fuck is up with FF 13 what do you mean the black guy is sassy okay

02:41:57.900 --> 02:42:06.340
so we both listen this sassy was one of the the adjectives I thought of when I

02:42:06.340 --> 02:42:11.660
was playing the game too and I'm less in I'm sorry it's just that's he just comes

02:42:11.660 --> 02:42:15.540
out kind of sassy you know you have to admit I'm a Barrett was kind of a little

02:42:15.540 --> 02:42:20.060
bit fucking sassy too but it was freaking hardcore that yeah that was a

02:42:20.060 --> 02:42:26.140
badass saws is sassy in a different way like dude Rama he has a fucking chocobo

02:42:26.140 --> 02:42:30.460
living in his fucking afro I mean come on but there is you sense that there is

02:42:30.460 --> 02:42:33.940
like again I don't want to give story spoilers but you sense that there is a

02:42:33.940 --> 02:42:39.660
definitely deeper story to him he's not just completely transparent comic relief

02:42:39.660 --> 02:42:44.300
they never they never Jansen Jansen was kind of sassy and lost Odyssey well they

02:42:44.300 --> 02:42:48.380
never explained right away at least where I'm at why he's even with them

02:42:48.380 --> 02:42:53.700
right now yeah but flashbacks will tell you a little later yes so it's all lost

02:42:53.700 --> 02:42:59.540
style remember so but easy he's a little bit sassy I it's better than Rama you

02:42:59.540 --> 02:43:03.380
after he's actually I will say he is my favorite character in the game right now

02:43:03.380 --> 02:43:08.040
because everybody else is in my opinion kind of such a stereotype of the Final

02:43:08.040 --> 02:43:12.260
Fantasy 7 characters in a way yeah yeah like I really I like him I think he's

02:43:12.260 --> 02:43:16.900
really interesting in the chocobo in the afro is so fucking adorable like I see

02:43:16.900 --> 02:43:21.620
like RuPaul sassy or just no no he's not like cheeky he's not like bitch you

02:43:21.620 --> 02:43:25.200
better work he's just the calm is he cheeky a little bit he's a little bit

02:43:25.200 --> 02:43:31.380
cheeky cheeky he's a little bit cheeky so sorry when you say sassy I think of

02:43:31.380 --> 02:43:35.100
your sassy pants no that's a whole different kind I know but that makes me

02:43:35.100 --> 02:43:40.460
think though of like RuPaul I don't know why but RuPaul makes me think sassy and

02:43:40.460 --> 02:43:46.540
Tyra he does say and I had to laugh because of the lethal rep lethal weapon

02:43:46.540 --> 02:43:53.900
reference I'm getting too old for this he does he does that no one is gonna

02:43:53.900 --> 02:43:59.580
ever top Sid for the attitude sit your ass down in the chair and drink your

02:43:59.580 --> 02:44:05.100
goddamn tea but Rama yeah be happy because I think they actually have a

02:44:05.100 --> 02:44:11.580
black guy doing his voice well I will soon find out because I don't know if

02:44:11.580 --> 02:44:16.580
you guys realize cuz Otacon is in a few fucking months and guess who's going to

02:44:16.580 --> 02:44:21.620
have to cosplay this guy you are yes everyone's like you have to cosplay this

02:44:21.620 --> 02:44:27.780
guy and I'm like oh fuck Rama he's pretty awesome he is it's it goes far

02:44:27.780 --> 02:44:31.500
beyond the color of his skin he's just a good character and he has a fucking

02:44:31.500 --> 02:44:35.700
chocobo in his fucking afro Rama okay okay now one more thing before I get the

02:44:35.700 --> 02:44:40.900
fuck out of here does that make it does that make it a chocobo all right I like

02:44:40.900 --> 02:44:44.460
that all right hurry the fuck up Rama time's almost up can I borrow somebody's

02:44:44.460 --> 02:44:48.940

call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this one to the fuck show this is

02:45:28.020 --> 02:45:34.220
a mega fucking 777 hello amiga fucking 777 what the fuck is on your mind

02:45:34.220 --> 02:45:43.540
tonight motherfucking PlayStation 2 or the Dreamcast killer ah so you're one of

02:45:43.540 --> 02:45:47.420
these bitter folks that the PlayStation 2 killed the Dreamcast and therefore we

02:45:47.420 --> 02:45:51.140
should not be celebrating its birthday we should be celebrating this one step

02:45:51.140 --> 02:46:02.020
closer to the grave yeah it it killed it we know it killed it and well amiga what

02:46:02.020 --> 02:46:05.540
could the Dreamcast you think in retrospect what could the Dreamcast have

02:46:05.540 --> 02:46:13.380
done to save itself gotten someone who is more skilled in marketing I guess

02:46:13.380 --> 02:46:19.340
someone that could have said you know hey when it comes to porting or whatnot

02:46:19.340 --> 02:46:27.260
you know the PlayStation 2 kind of isn't so good on this so you know our port of

02:46:27.260 --> 02:46:32.260
this particular game is looking better or something like that you're in no way

02:46:32.260 --> 02:46:38.780
related to the legend of Zaku by any chance are you high knock it off you know

02:46:38.780 --> 02:46:44.300
I just got a quirky voice that's all right that's cool so do I I just gonna

02:46:44.300 --> 02:46:46.420
say though if you were high then you've got one of those really cool stoner

02:46:46.420 --> 02:46:50.780
voices no I seriously there are certain people who just have really cool stoner

02:46:50.780 --> 02:46:58.700
voices you know what I mean no I do I do do you there's amiga is it all about

02:46:58.700 --> 02:47:02.740
PlayStation 2 hatred like you won't even touch it or can you even come around and

02:47:02.740 --> 02:47:06.700
admit okay there are there are some pretty fucking cool games on the ps2

02:47:06.700 --> 02:47:10.860
there are some nice games but a lot of the good games you know didn't really

02:47:10.860 --> 02:47:18.380
show up until like it was almost like halfway to was that its successor came

02:47:18.380 --> 02:47:27.100
around you know ps3 and so I guess the only really good good good thing that

02:47:27.100 --> 02:47:33.180
really I guess got me hooked was like was smugglers run which is a was a

02:47:33.180 --> 02:47:40.780
launch title that's pretty awesome and an ffx that was really it everything else

02:47:40.780 --> 02:47:49.580
yeah what no fan division I love fan vision really quickly we don't have a

02:47:49.580 --> 02:47:52.900
lot of fucking time left isn't you said you're a fan of Final Fantasy 10 what do

02:47:52.900 --> 02:47:55.860

02:47:55.860 --> 02:48:01.420
fuck it oh hell no I am NOT in interest of any

02:48:01.420 --> 02:48:06.700

of data digital crack the only ambition though that they don't have in there is

02:51:36.380 --> 02:51:42.020
the ambition to be a porn star or stripper so I'm really not interested in

02:51:42.020 --> 02:51:50.660
this expansion at all maybe my ambition is to host a crappy podcast on the

02:51:50.660 --> 02:51:55.220
internet or maybe they strive to be my wall slave you know the person that I

02:51:55.220 --> 02:52:01.100
trap inside my wall of death or drown in my pool what do you have like a sawhouse

02:52:01.100 --> 02:52:05.100
in there or what's the deal that's what I do in my sims games it's basically you

02:52:05.100 --> 02:52:09.620

02:54:28.300 --> 02:54:31.660
the one from crazy heart was the one that won the weary kind that was the

02:54:31.660 --> 02:54:35.340
one of those trying to win anyways whatever the only ones that were surprising to me

02:54:35.340 --> 02:54:39.620
that I didn't win would have been the hurt locker for both sound editing and

02:54:39.620 --> 02:54:45.900
sound mixing but the rest the rest that all the ones I had picked wait one did

02:54:45.900 --> 02:54:51.180

02:54:51.180 --> 02:54:54.420
was trending twins so and now I don't care anymore all right well all right

02:54:54.420 --> 02:54:57.180
we're on to the call hi you're on orange on this radio who's this

02:54:57.180 --> 02:55:02.100
sex link hey how the fuck are you a lot better than I have been during the

02:55:02.100 --> 02:55:05.340
beginning of week when I got 22 in my teeth pulled oh my gosh that's right I

02:55:05.340 --> 02:55:11.360
heard you had the big big dental surgery well you're painful shit but you're

02:55:11.360 --> 02:55:14.500
well you're talking now you sound pretty good so everything's better well well

02:55:14.500 --> 02:55:17.820
I'm talking good right now because I don't have the dentures and I don't keep

02:55:17.820 --> 02:55:22.660
them in 24-7 sighs well it's kind of hard at first I was drooling for a first

02:55:22.660 --> 02:55:26.900
couple days looking like a fucking idiot but you know hey you know you live you

02:55:26.900 --> 02:55:30.980
learn you do it very slowly so you know and it got me a lot of time to catch up

02:55:30.980 --> 02:55:34.860
on a few games and such so I had a friend that had to have that done kind

02:55:34.860 --> 02:55:39.540
of young like in the early 20s so it happens so all right well what's on your

02:55:39.540 --> 02:55:44.060
mind you're not excellent um nothing much you know it's great to hear that

02:55:44.060 --> 02:55:47.780
the DRM is finally cracked so this way during hurricane season I could sit down

02:55:47.780 --> 02:55:52.060
with my laptop and play Assassin's Creed 2 and not worry about being connected

02:55:52.060 --> 02:55:57.980
on to a fucking internet fee 24-7 so because you know it's a lot of times you

02:55:57.980 --> 02:56:01.020
know during those down times it's good to sit there with a laptop and play a

02:56:01.020 --> 02:56:05.860
couple games and get caught back up so you know and also the ps2 thing is I

02:56:05.860 --> 02:56:09.580
have my ps2 fat I got the one the originals sing right across from me

02:56:09.580 --> 02:56:13.300
still works perfectly after all these years with a bunch of my games still

02:56:13.300 --> 02:56:17.540
going through so I mean you know how they get ps2 nothing but love for that

02:56:17.540 --> 02:56:21.860
so I mean system that doesn't break or you know go down for two and a half days

02:56:21.860 --> 02:56:29.500
you know when there's certain leap year issues with other consoles so you know

02:56:29.500 --> 02:56:34.180
nice I like though that we kind of get the back-to-back calls about you know

02:56:34.180 --> 02:56:38.980
ps2 love versus ps2 hate it's it's it's kind of cool not not hate just you know

02:56:38.980 --> 02:56:43.580
well you know there's a shitload of games for ps2 right now I'm still going

02:56:43.580 --> 02:56:47.380
through I mean I I came and started sitting here and tell you how many games

02:56:47.380 --> 02:56:50.100
I got to go through for the ps2 I'm sitting right across I haven't even

02:56:50.100 --> 02:56:54.980
touched or I went halfway through and you know and and you know and I still

02:56:54.980 --> 02:56:57.580
have a lot of them and I'm planning on going through them before I even

02:56:57.580 --> 02:57:01.780
consider to get a ps3 or anything like that because you know that's gonna be

02:57:01.780 --> 02:57:07.900
more on my list so I mean you know between that my PSP and my PC games I'm

02:57:07.900 --> 02:57:11.740
pretty much set for probably about almost a year give or take it it does

02:57:11.740 --> 02:57:15.420
have one of the fucking largest libraries of video games just ever and

02:57:15.420 --> 02:57:18.460
it's not stopping you know if you listen to Japanese release days there is still

02:57:18.460 --> 02:57:22.020
fucking shit coming out for it now so it's yeah but unfortunately the American

02:57:22.020 --> 02:57:27.380
version though is slowing down though yeah it depends the type of games you're

02:57:27.380 --> 02:57:33.900
into they always be some fucking poker game coming out no actually like a poker

02:57:33.900 --> 02:57:37.460
game for most a year all right I'm fucking smoking crack sorry 2008 was the

02:57:37.460 --> 02:57:40.940
last poker game we had come out no the last few games we had come out on

02:57:40.940 --> 02:57:44.740
PlayStation 2 or coming out they have a how to train your I can they actually

02:57:44.740 --> 02:57:48.940
have a soccer Wars game that was coming out in PlayStation 2 getting the nice

02:57:48.940 --> 02:57:53.940
little collector's edition treatment to that in April there's gonna be the Lord

02:57:53.940 --> 02:58:01.900
of the Rings Aragon's quest you know Lord of the Rings for kids and yeah that's

02:58:01.900 --> 02:58:05.100
pretty much that's it unless you're talking about maybe a few EA games but

02:58:05.100 --> 02:58:10.220
even EA cutting them out now for sports stuff at least maybe Madden probably

02:58:10.220 --> 02:58:14.540
will have a ps2 version I got it I got to jump in here cuz x-links three

02:58:14.540 --> 02:58:16.980
minutes are up but quickly do you have any other quick final thoughts for us

02:58:16.980 --> 02:58:20.140
nope that's pretty much about it that's all I had to say so all right feel

02:58:20.140 --> 02:58:23.660
better soon buddy see you on well after a little bit thanks all right later all

02:58:23.660 --> 02:58:25.780

02:58:25.780 --> 02:58:28.660
listeners in tonight so thank you guys very much for the phone calls really

02:58:28.660 --> 02:58:32.380
appreciate it if you didn't get through sorry guys I'm really fucking sorry but

02:58:32.380 --> 02:58:35.980
you have to send us a fucking email mailbag at orange lounge radio.com I know

02:58:35.980 --> 02:58:39.100
Loki's been fucking waiting to do some last-minute fucking stories right yeah

02:58:39.100 --> 02:58:44.500
sure all right there's there's some interesting information apparently

02:58:44.500 --> 02:58:48.060
Batman Arkham Asylum is getting the game of the year edition which was supposed

02:58:48.060 --> 02:58:51.740
to be coming out over in the US and as far as I'm aware still is coming out

02:58:51.740 --> 02:58:55.260
over in the US unless they well they've already answered they're not but

02:58:55.260 --> 02:58:58.420
whatever anyways what's kind of neat about the game of the year edition though

02:58:58.420 --> 02:59:04.620
if you may already have you know the version of the game you will actually be

02:59:04.620 --> 02:59:08.980
able to play this game in stereoscopic 3d that's right it's gonna come with 3d

02:59:08.980 --> 02:59:15.860
glasses and apparently use a technology called a tri-oviz 3d that will allow you

02:59:15.860 --> 02:59:20.460
to view the game in 3d and doesn't rely on red and blue lenses meaning the

02:59:20.460 --> 02:59:25.540
colors are preserved and apparently will work with HD and standard definition sets

02:59:25.540 --> 02:59:30.340
which you know if that works now I think they should that sounds like a good idea

02:59:30.340 --> 02:59:35.460
it sounds cheap speaking of good ideas coming from Warner Brothers okay well I'm

02:59:35.460 --> 02:59:41.700
being sarcastic here they're in talks now to produce a space invaders movie

02:59:41.700 --> 02:59:47.020
yes the movie industry has run out of ideas well at least they could do

02:59:47.020 --> 02:59:49.780
whatever the fuck they wanted I mean it's like there's this big fucking plot

02:59:49.780 --> 02:59:55.660
to space invaders aliens are invading earth shoot them Wow yes the space

02:59:55.660 --> 03:00:01.580
invaders apparently the they're speculating that the film will be a big

03:00:01.580 --> 03:00:11.580
bucked a big-budget action blockbuster held by some prolific director Sony has

03:00:11.580 --> 03:00:16.580
filed us some patents for game demos apparently that will lose feature over

03:00:16.580 --> 03:00:23.580
time which I have to say is the worst idea ever can't just fucking redownload

03:00:23.580 --> 03:00:28.220
it well maybe you won't be able to maybe it's gonna be like those time trials you

03:00:28.220 --> 03:00:31.140
know on the windows and stuff like that and why should I have to fucking

03:00:31.140 --> 03:00:36.180
redownload say if I want to show a demo I play demo say for a game that you may

03:00:36.180 --> 03:00:39.460
not be getting the lot of press or whatever and I want to show my friends

03:00:39.460 --> 03:00:43.580
like for example wet wet I thought the demo was fucking awesome and I show my

03:00:43.580 --> 03:00:47.660
friends and they got excited about it if I have to play the game again and the

03:00:47.660 --> 03:00:51.340
features are removed that's gonna be pretty disappointing well it was cool

03:00:51.340 --> 03:00:54.860
the first time I played it well what you have to do is you have to make another

03:00:54.860 --> 03:01:06.260
PlayStation profile and have your friend sign in to play no apparently Ubisoft is

03:01:06.260 --> 03:01:11.340
looking to take on Tony Hawk which shouldn't be too difficult at this point

03:01:11.340 --> 03:01:16.380
and they're gonna put out Sean White skateboarding yes Sean White

03:01:16.380 --> 03:01:20.860
apparently skateboards as well and unfortunately though in the screenshot

03:01:20.860 --> 03:01:26.220
they have of Sean White snowboarding looks like a Geico caveman so I don't

03:01:26.220 --> 03:01:29.300
know what's going on there because he certainly doesn't look like a Geico

03:01:29.300 --> 03:01:36.380
caveman normally and yes so they're gonna be releasing that game apparently

03:01:36.380 --> 03:01:40.820
and most likely on the Wii because that's where the last one came test

03:01:40.820 --> 03:01:46.060
drive unlimited is getting a sequel coming out apparently this fall and to

03:01:46.060 --> 03:01:52.380
playstation 3 Xbox 360 and PC and apparently the sequel will also have new

03:01:52.380 --> 03:01:56.980
elements including day night cycles weather effects and vehicle damage and

03:01:56.980 --> 03:02:01.460
hopefully the cops will figure out how to chase you down when you drive off the

03:02:01.460 --> 03:02:06.340
road apparently our chatters are not big fans of my Muppet voice which I guess is

03:02:06.340 --> 03:02:11.540
what that is let's see fucking Shahran and chat says so his next show the

The O.L.R. Muppet Show is all about moi.

Wow, I fucking made Loki shut the fuck up.

03:02:55.760 --> 03:03:00.760
No, I'm just rolling my eyes, and unfortunately you can't hear that on the radio.

03:03:01.760 --> 03:03:03.760
Alright. Um...

03:03:04.760 --> 03:03:06.760
I don't know, you people.

03:03:06.760 --> 03:03:07.760
Yes, you do.

03:03:07.760 --> 03:03:08.760
I'm hiding.

03:03:08.760 --> 03:03:10.760
You're my BFF. Alright.

03:03:10.760 --> 03:03:11.760
I know, Rob.

03:03:11.760 --> 03:03:17.760
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts tonight, because believe it or not, we're at the end of the fucking show.

03:03:17.760 --> 03:03:19.760
I hope you enjoyed your fucking selves tonight.

03:03:19.760 --> 03:03:22.760
Uh, it was a pretty fucking good time, and I'm sure we said the F word a lot.

03:03:22.760 --> 03:03:26.760
I don't... Maybe we'll get a count after the podcast goes out. I don't fucking know. We'll see.

03:03:26.760 --> 03:03:28.760
I didn't put a lot of fucking effort into it, unfortunately.

03:03:28.760 --> 03:03:31.760
That's alright. At the beginning of the show, it had a lot more fucks in the end. It was a...

03:03:31.760 --> 03:03:33.760
You get tired after a while.

03:03:33.760 --> 03:03:41.760
You do. You do. But it's... I would say you almost have to have more intelligence to be able to incorporate the word fuck into your fucking sentences for a long period of time.

03:03:41.760 --> 03:03:43.760
It takes some fucking creativity to do that.

03:03:43.760 --> 03:03:44.760
So...

03:03:44.760 --> 03:03:49.760
Alright. Um, thank you guys very fucking much for tuning in and supporting independent fucking radio.

03:03:49.760 --> 03:03:55.760
We really fucking appreciate your support, and if you fucking like what you fucking heard, please go give us a really fucking nice review on fucking iTunes.

03:03:55.760 --> 03:03:57.760
We really like five-star fucking reviews.

03:03:57.760 --> 03:04:03.760
Uh, it doesn't just have to fucking be on iTunes, though. Just tell a fucking friend, you know, in real life. Project Real Life, right?

03:04:03.760 --> 03:04:08.760
Tell some fucking friends what you heard on Orange Honch fucking radio, and, uh, tell friends to listen to shows.

03:04:08.760 --> 03:04:12.760
But you might want to not have them fucking start with this episode.

03:04:12.760 --> 03:04:17.760
Like, this should be, like, maybe the fourth episode you listen to. Don't have this be somebody's fucking first episode.

03:04:17.760 --> 03:04:21.760
But just tell your fucking friends. Word of mouth. That's all we fucking got, because we're an independent fucking podcast.

03:04:21.760 --> 03:04:22.760
Aw, yeah.

03:04:22.760 --> 03:04:26.760
Um, that's it. Let's go around and hear everybody's fucking final thought tonight.

03:04:26.760 --> 03:04:28.760
DarkSakura, what's your fucking final thought?

03:04:28.760 --> 03:04:31.760
Uh, fuck.

03:04:31.760 --> 03:04:33.760
Loki, your fucking final thought tonight?

03:04:33.760 --> 03:04:45.760
Uh, we'll have to see where this thing goes with this guy ripping me off. Um, I don't know. It's, it's very annoying.

03:04:45.760 --> 03:04:50.760
And my fucking final thought tonight is sassafras.

03:04:50.760 --> 03:04:55.760
Good night, everybody. Have a great week. We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.

03:04:55.760 --> 03:04:57.760
P.S. Fuck.

03:05:25.760 --> 03:05:28.760
See you next week.
