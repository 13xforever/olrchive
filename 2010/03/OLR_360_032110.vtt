00:00.000 --> 00:21.160
Today, March 21, 2010, the Xbox 360 is set to get USB storage, GameStop test perks for

00:21.160 --> 00:29.920
loyal customers, and what Playstation 3 add-on is selling out in Japan.

00:29.920 --> 00:37.240
Hello, my friends, and welcome to episode number 360 of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:37.240 --> 00:39.360
I'm having trouble speaking tonight.

00:39.360 --> 00:40.680
This bodes well for tonight's show.

00:40.680 --> 00:43.780
The video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.

00:43.780 --> 00:47.680
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host,

00:47.680 --> 00:52.120
not here right now, but will be here a little later, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie

00:52.120 --> 00:53.120
Summers.

00:53.120 --> 00:57.280
She's at another commitment right now, but she'll be here about 7, 7.30-ish Pacific time,

00:57.280 --> 00:59.480
depending on when that is all over.

00:59.480 --> 01:03.040
But never fear, I am joined by the one and only tech master, Loki.

01:03.040 --> 01:04.040
Hello.

01:04.040 --> 01:05.040
How are you doing tonight, Loki?

01:05.040 --> 01:06.040
Doing fine.

01:06.040 --> 01:07.040
Good.

01:07.040 --> 01:08.040
At least he has chicken.

01:08.040 --> 01:09.040
Once again, I noticed he stopped by KFC tonight.

01:09.040 --> 01:10.040
Yeah, I don't know.

01:10.040 --> 01:11.040
It sounded good again.

01:11.040 --> 01:12.040
All right.

01:12.040 --> 01:13.040
That's fine.

01:13.040 --> 01:14.440
Also joining us tonight, we have a special guest.

01:14.440 --> 01:17.200
He was here a couple of weeks ago, and he decided to come on back.

01:17.200 --> 01:19.440
It is Salacious Pop, or Alan.

01:19.440 --> 01:20.440
Hello.

01:20.440 --> 01:21.440
How are you?

01:21.440 --> 01:22.440
I'm good.

01:22.440 --> 01:23.440
Yeah?

01:23.440 --> 01:24.440
Yes, I'm going to try and talk a little bit more tonight.

01:24.440 --> 01:25.960
You're going to try and talk more tonight.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.600
Good, because you have to fill in for Dark Sakura because she's out.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.480
But remember, those mics, not very sensitive.

01:30.480 --> 01:31.480
So keep it.

01:31.480 --> 01:32.480
Yeah.

01:32.480 --> 01:33.480
A little stage fright last time I was on.

01:33.480 --> 01:34.480
That's all right.

01:34.480 --> 01:35.480
Tonight, you're going to be extra sassy.

01:35.480 --> 01:36.480
Yeah, I hope so.

01:36.480 --> 01:39.080
You're going to be our sassy gay friend on the show tonight.

01:39.080 --> 01:40.080
A stupid bitch.

01:40.080 --> 01:41.640
Have you seen those YouTubes?

01:41.640 --> 01:42.640
Yes.

01:42.640 --> 01:43.640
You didn't find them funny.

01:43.640 --> 01:44.640
I'm not a fan.

01:44.640 --> 01:45.640
Why not?

01:45.640 --> 01:46.640
They're funny.

01:46.640 --> 01:47.640
I don't know.

01:47.640 --> 01:48.640
You're not a fan of the sassy gay friend?

01:48.640 --> 01:49.640
Not their fan on Facebook?

01:49.640 --> 01:50.640
Fine.

01:50.640 --> 01:51.640
I think they're funny.

01:51.640 --> 01:52.640
All right.

01:52.640 --> 01:53.640
Forget it.

01:53.640 --> 02:00.320
No, we tape live every week, of course, at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

02:00.320 --> 02:03.240
It's 6 p.m. Pacific, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

02:03.240 --> 02:08.960
If you're listening to us live, pull up a chair and join us in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com,

02:08.960 --> 02:12.560
where we have the first comment tonight from Black Wolf, of course, our good pal who does

02:12.560 --> 02:16.440
the show before us here at All Games, saying in our chat room, Sky broke into Dark Sakura's

02:16.440 --> 02:17.440
house.

02:17.440 --> 02:19.320
And X-Link follows that up with, Loki picked the lock.

02:19.320 --> 02:20.880
No, Dan is here, folks.

02:20.880 --> 02:22.440
Dan, the man let us in.

02:22.440 --> 02:24.280
I didn't come until way later.

02:24.280 --> 02:28.080
He's in the gaming vault right now, and I don't know what he's playing, but he's playing.

02:28.080 --> 02:30.320
He was playing Otomedius Gorgeous.

02:30.320 --> 02:31.320
Ah.

02:31.320 --> 02:33.240
I sold my Japanese 360.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.680
Oh, very cool.

02:34.680 --> 02:35.680
Okay.

02:35.680 --> 02:38.640
Yeah, I wondered why you brought a 360 to the show tonight, and I thought it might be

02:38.640 --> 02:43.280
because this is episode number 360, and I was like, oh, are we going to take one apart

02:43.280 --> 02:44.280
live on air?

02:44.280 --> 02:45.560
And I was like, well, that's going to be shitty radio.

02:45.560 --> 02:46.560
Could do that.

02:46.560 --> 02:47.560
I have to.

02:47.560 --> 02:48.560
Yeah.

02:48.560 --> 02:49.560
It's not very exciting, but you could do that.

02:49.560 --> 02:53.240
Yeah, especially when it's a radio show, it's more exciting to hear you bitch about the

02:53.240 --> 02:54.240
guy that stole your 360.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.240
How's that going, by the way?

02:55.240 --> 02:57.240
The cops ever do anything about that?

02:57.240 --> 02:58.240
No, not yet.

02:58.240 --> 02:59.240
Sorry to hear it.

02:59.240 --> 03:00.240
Bastards.

03:00.240 --> 03:01.240
All right.

03:01.240 --> 03:03.880
Well, we always start off the show with a little bit of how was your gaming week.

03:03.880 --> 03:06.360
So tonight we'll start with Loki, usually ladies first.

03:06.360 --> 03:09.360
But since there are no ladies, Loki will have to be our lady tonight.

03:09.360 --> 03:13.760
I will not be your lady tonight.

03:13.760 --> 03:14.760
That's okay.

03:14.760 --> 03:15.760
Loki, how was your gaming week?

03:15.760 --> 03:20.560
Very uneventful, actually, because I don't know what I was playing this week, but not

03:20.560 --> 03:24.400
a lot of new things, I guess.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.320
More Grand Theft Auto as usual.

03:26.320 --> 03:32.080
Still not enough Grand Theft Auto, I think, because I find myself kind of in a flux as

03:32.080 --> 03:36.200
far as going up the leaderboards, just because other people are playing it more than I am.

03:36.200 --> 03:39.240
So I go up a lot and then I come back down.

03:39.240 --> 03:42.520
And I go up a lot and come back down, because other people are playing it and getting ahead

03:42.520 --> 03:43.520
of me.

03:43.520 --> 03:45.000
So that's not a big deal.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
My TrueSkill stuff, though, I occasionally lose a game to my co-workers.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.520
And unfortunately, the level I'm at now, I'm so high that it knocks me down quite a bit

03:54.520 --> 03:56.560
for just losing a game by like a few bucks.

03:56.560 --> 04:00.120
Thankfully, though, I'm not going to allow that to happen anymore.

04:00.120 --> 04:02.520
And so it's going pretty well.

04:02.520 --> 04:07.640
I think I'm like ranked 75 now or something like that in TrueSkill, which is not bad.

04:07.640 --> 04:12.560
This week, though, I am looking forward to being able to hopefully play against some

04:12.560 --> 04:16.400
of the Rockstar employees, because I know they're going to be doing their event on Tuesday

04:16.400 --> 04:22.280
during, like, I think it goes from 1 to 4 Eastern.

04:22.280 --> 04:24.760
I'm not positive, but I think that's time frame.

04:24.760 --> 04:28.760
Maybe, no, 4 to 7 Eastern, that's right.

04:28.760 --> 04:31.600
Won the 4 my time.

04:31.600 --> 04:34.800
So I'm looking forward to playing some of them.

04:34.800 --> 04:40.360
And then other than Grand Theft Auto, I played more Final Fantasy XIII.

04:40.360 --> 04:45.160
I finally made it to the second disc, now at Palimporum.

04:45.160 --> 04:51.480
And weren't those, like, character names from, like, Final Fantasy II or something like that?

04:51.480 --> 04:56.480
It's Palim and Porum, but the way they spell it in XIII is a little different.

04:56.480 --> 05:00.360
But I kind of am convinced it is a nod a little bit to Final Fantasy IV.

05:00.360 --> 05:04.080
Because I was like, hey, that's a name from something else.

05:04.080 --> 05:06.440
And what is up with Cid being bad?

05:06.440 --> 05:09.960
I mean, first off, Cid doesn't look like Cid.

05:09.960 --> 05:11.200
OMG, spoilers!

05:11.200 --> 05:13.680
There's supposed to be a six month moratorium on spoilers, remember?

05:13.680 --> 05:18.600
Well, everybody knows that Cid doesn't look like Cid because they had pictures out there already.

05:18.600 --> 05:19.160
Fine.

05:19.160 --> 05:19.760
I figured that out.

05:19.760 --> 05:20.320
Fine.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.920
And, you know, and he may be evil, he may not be evil.

05:22.920 --> 05:26.880
He still has an airship thing, some sort of ship.

05:26.880 --> 05:30.000
But it's, like, emo Cid.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.560
Wasn't Cid bad in XII?

05:32.560 --> 05:33.480
I never played XII.

05:33.480 --> 05:34.600
I can't remember.

05:34.600 --> 05:39.920
I want to say I read, I didn't get far enough, honestly, but I want to say I read somewhere that he was bad.

05:39.920 --> 05:41.000
XII.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.160
And I know Cid never looks like Cid, but come on, man.

05:43.160 --> 05:46.880
I mean, it's a stretch right now.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.360
Whatever.

05:48.360 --> 05:51.280
And then, what else?

05:51.280 --> 05:54.400
So, yeah, it's kind of moving along.

05:54.400 --> 06:02.240
And, you know, I'm to the point now where I'm just running past a lot of the battles because I just don't want to fight them anymore.

06:02.240 --> 06:03.720
I just keep going.

06:03.720 --> 06:05.600
Well, you can do that because you cheated.

06:05.600 --> 06:12.080
You're a cheating cheater, and you put in some code that gives you the 99,000 damage every time you strike.

06:12.080 --> 06:17.480
And the first thing Loki bitches about when he gets to your studio, I don't know why the game won't give me the trophy, because you're a cheater.

06:17.480 --> 06:19.520
Cheaters don't win.

06:19.520 --> 06:22.480
Well, I'll play it again, but I just won't cheat that way.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.200
I'll do something else.

06:24.200 --> 06:24.760
Yeah, right.

06:24.760 --> 06:28.040
I think you're going to be like, oh, my arcade cabinet, or oh, Grand Theft Auto IV.

06:28.040 --> 06:32.440
Speaking of cheating, though, that reminds me, I played more Borderlands this week.

06:32.440 --> 06:38.720
I finally loaded up the new expansion a little bit, just because I'm trying to raise my level cap again.

06:38.720 --> 06:49.600
And then we played a little bit of the zombie island of Dr. Ned, and that was kind of fun.

06:49.600 --> 06:55.320
Of course, everything's level 30 right now, we're level 50, so it's quite easy.

06:55.320 --> 07:00.120
But it's neat popping heads off of zombies and taking their brains.

07:00.120 --> 07:05.000
And then, yeah, that's pretty much it, I think.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.200
All righty.

07:06.200 --> 07:07.920
Alan, how was your gaming week?

07:07.920 --> 07:09.120
What kind of stuff you played this week?

07:09.120 --> 07:10.360
Pretty good.

07:10.360 --> 07:13.560
Played some Robot Unicorn Attack.

07:13.560 --> 07:14.960
Was that inspired by OLR?

07:14.960 --> 07:16.840
Yeah, kind of, yeah.

07:16.840 --> 07:25.160
Lots of WoW, World of Warcraft, and oddly enough, a lot of Bejeweled and Peggle within World of Warcraft, so kind of meta.

07:25.160 --> 07:29.360
Some Warcraft III, actually, going back to 2002.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.200
Picking it old school in Warcraft III.

07:31.200 --> 07:36.200
Blizzard just updated a patch for Warcraft III to fix some exploits.

07:36.200 --> 07:40.520
Why now? I mean, it's so far out, it's like, why bother?

07:40.520 --> 07:42.320
They're awesome and they support their games forever.

07:42.320 --> 07:44.200
How long have the exploits been available?

07:44.200 --> 07:47.600
Like, were the exploits just found a couple months ago or something?

07:47.600 --> 07:53.800
I think they're just from the previous patch from a year ago, and I guess they're really obscure.

07:53.800 --> 08:00.560
But yeah, there's so much lore in World of Warcraft that I just launched three to play a few missions from that for nostalgia.

08:00.560 --> 08:01.840
So that's about it.

08:01.840 --> 08:03.520
That's it for your gaming week?

08:03.520 --> 08:06.840
Well, we played a bunch of games this morning.

08:06.840 --> 08:08.160
You're going to let me talk about it, huh?

08:08.160 --> 08:09.560
That's all right. I don't get into it.

08:09.560 --> 08:13.400
You feel free to chime in, but I want to go to our chat room, chat.orangelauncher.com.

08:13.400 --> 08:18.480
LiquidParrot says, I remember taking down Sky's high score in Bejeweled on Facebook by cheating.

08:18.480 --> 08:20.080
Needless to say, it was frowned upon.

08:20.080 --> 08:23.360
Yes, because cheating cheaters are rude.

08:23.360 --> 08:25.280
Especially in multiplayer environments.

08:25.280 --> 08:29.240
Like, I don't care that, I don't really care that Loki cheats on Final Fantasy 13.

08:29.240 --> 08:32.040
Like, if he wants to ruin the game for himself by doing that, fine.

08:32.040 --> 08:33.720
Have fun. I don't care.

08:33.720 --> 08:34.680
Okay, but...

08:34.680 --> 08:36.440
I've turned it into a more casual game.

08:36.440 --> 08:38.560
Now I don't have to waste my time.

08:38.560 --> 08:42.840
No, and you have managed to make it be nothing but cutscenes of Final Fantasy 13.

08:42.840 --> 08:44.120
It's all it is anyway!

08:44.120 --> 08:46.040
I was going to say, you took the...

08:46.040 --> 08:50.080
You managed to take what little game there actually was out of Final Fantasy 13.

08:50.080 --> 08:52.600
You're like, Odin battle? Ha!

08:52.600 --> 08:55.720
Actually, the Odin battles, or the, um...

08:55.720 --> 08:59.960
The battles against the summons are actually difficult still, because you have to do combo damage to them,

08:59.960 --> 09:02.920
not necessarily damage damage to them.

09:02.920 --> 09:05.560
So, it's still as difficult as it would normally be.

09:05.560 --> 09:06.880
Everything else, so...

09:06.880 --> 09:08.080
Right through it.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.200
It's like, oh no, this monster's gonna be really hard.

09:10.200 --> 09:11.080
Tap.

09:11.080 --> 09:12.520
Okay, that's done. Thank god.

09:12.520 --> 09:15.040
I don't wanna have to sit here for fifteen minutes.

09:15.040 --> 09:15.840
Alright.

09:15.840 --> 09:16.920
Uh, as long as...

09:16.920 --> 09:19.520
Like, how long did it take you to get to that part in the game?

09:19.520 --> 09:20.720
I'm only six hours in.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.200
And that's how far...

09:22.200 --> 09:23.320
Wait, and you're at Palimporum?

09:23.320 --> 09:23.840
Yeah.

09:23.840 --> 09:24.360
And you're six hours in?

09:24.360 --> 09:24.760
Six.

09:24.760 --> 09:28.400
I'm just about where you are, and I'm probably...

09:28.400 --> 09:30.480
It probably took me about fourteen hours to get there.

09:30.480 --> 09:32.160
I think I spent about the last couple hours in Palimporum.

09:32.160 --> 09:34.000
See, that's how quick that, you know...

09:34.000 --> 09:37.800
Oddly enough, I didn't play Final Fantasy 13 at all this week.

09:37.800 --> 09:39.320
I've just been distracted with...

09:39.320 --> 09:41.640
I don't know how many of you heard the call on Bobby's show tonight,

09:41.640 --> 09:43.040
but I have a lot going on in my personal life.

09:43.040 --> 09:46.400
Like, I'm gonna be changing my day job in the next couple weeks, which is big.

09:46.400 --> 09:48.120
And then, you know, I just moved recently.

09:48.120 --> 09:50.280
So, and then, you know, Boston's coming up too,

09:50.280 --> 09:54.360
which, honestly, I haven't given as much thought to, but that is definitely on my mind.

09:54.360 --> 09:57.120
So, I haven't had as much gaming time until the weekend,

09:57.120 --> 10:00.800
when Alan and I just played a crapload of stuff this weekend.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.400
So, sadly, I haven't really been in Final Fantasy 13.

10:03.400 --> 10:06.080
And some folks in chat kinda arguing about the Odin battle.

10:06.080 --> 10:10.000
I lost the first time, and then once I did the Libra...

10:10.000 --> 10:11.680
And Alan can vouch for this, because he was there.

10:11.680 --> 10:14.800
I did the Libra and read that he was weak to chain attacks, and I was like,

10:14.800 --> 10:17.200
oh, just use a Ravage Ravage in your party.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.080
Easy.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.440
Well, they're all weak to chain attacks.

10:20.440 --> 10:21.520
Well, him especially.

10:21.520 --> 10:23.840
It said something like, I don't know, but for some reason that just worked.

10:23.840 --> 10:26.400
Like, you just keep switching between Ravage and Medic.

10:26.400 --> 10:29.360
And that's not really a spoiler, because the one thing I think a lot of people,

10:29.360 --> 10:31.800
when they're first getting into Final Fantasy 13, sometimes forget,

10:31.800 --> 10:36.240
and I'll just kinda put this pro tip out there, and then I'll get into other games this week.

10:36.240 --> 10:38.640
Keep in mind when you're trying to fill a stagger bar.

10:38.640 --> 10:41.360
Ravagers increase that bar quickly.

10:41.360 --> 10:43.320
Commandos maintain it.

10:43.320 --> 10:45.040
So, if you are trying to get, like, especially, like,

10:45.040 --> 10:47.560
if you're in the part where you're fighting, like, the Metal Armadillos,

10:47.560 --> 10:49.440
or whatever, that takes forever to kill,

10:49.440 --> 10:52.640
remember that you can use a team of all Ravagers.

10:52.640 --> 10:56.160
You just need to paradigm shift over and get a Commando in there once in a while

10:56.160 --> 10:58.200
to make sure the bar doesn't drop too fast.

10:58.200 --> 11:01.560
But then you can switch right back to Ravagers.

11:01.560 --> 11:05.640
So, learning kind of the difference between the Commando and the Ravager is key.

11:05.640 --> 11:08.440
Because honestly, their attacks, about the same amount of damage.

11:08.440 --> 11:10.720
The Synergist is like a Red Mage.

11:10.720 --> 11:12.640
Yeah, and your Synergist is a Red Mage, basically.

11:12.640 --> 11:15.960
And, but Hope and Saws are completely different types of Synergists,

11:15.960 --> 11:16.960
which is interesting.

11:16.960 --> 11:20.600
Anyhow, I don't want to get too much into FongSC-13 spoilers,

11:20.600 --> 11:22.360
because I know there's people that haven't even touched it yet,

11:22.360 --> 11:25.400
but I'm trying very hard not to give story spoilers.

11:25.400 --> 11:29.760
There's still that one little revelation I picked up on last week

11:29.760 --> 11:31.760
that I'm like, I really want to find out if that's for real,

11:31.760 --> 11:34.640
what I'm thinking, or if I'm just making shit up in my head.

11:34.640 --> 11:37.040
There's another little twist that you figure out later on.

11:37.040 --> 11:39.800
I like how the way they kind of addressed it, you know,

11:39.800 --> 11:41.360
because you're like, way a second,

11:41.360 --> 11:43.680
what's that person doing in that cutscene?

11:43.680 --> 11:45.960
You know, that type of thing.

11:45.960 --> 11:48.520
I, you will see, we'll see.

11:48.520 --> 11:49.960
Ionotropic in chat wants to know,

11:49.960 --> 11:51.720
how do you read the info after using Libra?

11:51.720 --> 11:53.320
I hit the R1 button.

11:53.320 --> 11:55.120
That's on PS3, I imagine.

11:55.120 --> 11:56.440
It's the right shoulder button.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.280
360, it's the trigger of the shoulder, yeah.

11:58.280 --> 11:59.280
It's the slow button.

11:59.280 --> 12:02.960
OK, other stuff I've actually been playing this week.

12:02.960 --> 12:05.800
Quite a bit, thanks to The Weeknd and Alan being here.

12:05.800 --> 12:08.960
OK, the one I know people in chat want me to talk about,

12:08.960 --> 12:12.960
we had just a spur of the moment, impromptu battle

12:12.960 --> 12:15.960
with Undersedation Live last night in Perfect Dark.

12:15.960 --> 12:18.120
So the Saturday night show on all games,

12:18.120 --> 12:20.400
Undersedation Live, Travis and Breslull,

12:20.400 --> 12:21.280
it was their off week,

12:21.280 --> 12:23.520
because they're bi-weekly right now,

12:23.520 --> 12:25.800
or what is it, no, bi-monthly is when you're every other week

12:25.800 --> 12:28.440
because they have Sakura Con on the horizon

12:28.440 --> 12:29.800
and John's really busy.

12:29.800 --> 12:31.560
So they're only every other week right now.

12:31.560 --> 12:32.640
So this was their off week.

12:32.640 --> 12:35.560
So they were on Perfect Dark last night really late.

12:35.560 --> 12:37.280
And I kept getting all these messages,

12:37.280 --> 12:39.480
like we signed on to play something else.

12:39.480 --> 12:41.400
What were we playing last night on 360?

12:41.400 --> 12:43.240
I don't remember, we started to play something else,

12:43.240 --> 12:44.720
Rock Band, I think,

12:44.720 --> 12:46.840
because we were gonna do the Gaga Pack and Rock Band.

12:46.840 --> 12:49.440
So we started to get in and do that.

12:49.440 --> 12:51.920
And then we get this message from John that was like,

12:51.920 --> 12:53.760
dude, come play Perfect Dark with us.

12:53.760 --> 12:55.320
And here's the thing that I have to admit,

12:55.320 --> 12:57.040
like I know this is gonna surprise a lot of people,

12:57.040 --> 13:01.040
but I never played Perfect Dark on the Nintendo 64.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.640
Anyone know something else?

13:02.640 --> 13:04.640
I never played Goldeneye either.

13:04.640 --> 13:07.480
Like I watched people play it, but I never played it.

13:07.480 --> 13:08.600
Don't judge me, OK?

13:08.600 --> 13:10.440
There was other shooter games I played.

13:10.440 --> 13:13.840
I played Doom, I played Quake, I played Duke Nukem.

13:13.840 --> 13:16.880
I just never got around to playing Goldeneye

13:16.880 --> 13:20.080
because I didn't get a 64 until really late in the game.

13:20.080 --> 13:21.680
And by that point I just kind of bought it

13:21.680 --> 13:23.920
from Mario Party and Pokemon Snap.

13:23.920 --> 13:24.760
Don't judge me!

13:25.800 --> 13:28.840
So somehow I never played Perfect Dark.

13:28.840 --> 13:32.200
So, but they were like, you gotta get it, you gotta get it.

13:32.200 --> 13:34.200
And I played the demo earlier in the day

13:34.200 --> 13:37.000
before Alan showed up and I was kind of like, OK,

13:37.000 --> 13:39.240
well, I don't know, I don't really get this.

13:39.240 --> 13:41.200
Like I see how it's Nintendo 64

13:41.200 --> 13:42.760
and it definitely looks like they put a lot of work

13:42.760 --> 13:44.680
into the overhaul of this, but I don't know.

13:44.680 --> 13:48.040
I just, I don't really get this, whatever.

13:48.040 --> 13:49.080
But I'm like, it wasn't bad.

13:49.080 --> 13:50.120
It was just, you know, I just,

13:50.120 --> 13:53.320
I think this would mean more if I held in my memories.

13:53.320 --> 13:57.520
So I finally, he berates me with a message.

13:57.520 --> 13:59.360
Travis sends me a text message going,

13:59.360 --> 14:00.800
you pussy, play Perfect Dark with us.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.200
And then Misty's getting in on it.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.480
Like people, just everybody's just berating me.

14:04.480 --> 14:05.880
So I'm like, fine!

14:05.880 --> 14:07.800
I will fucking come play Perfect Dark with you

14:07.800 --> 14:09.480
and shoot you on the face.

14:09.480 --> 14:12.360
So luckily enough, the Perfect Dark multiplayer

14:12.360 --> 14:14.520
is cool enough where both Alan and I

14:14.520 --> 14:16.520
could sign into our respective Xbox accounts

14:16.520 --> 14:19.000
on the same console and play like the split screen.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.160
And we were in a match.

14:20.160 --> 14:25.160
So in the match was Travis, John, Misty, myself, Alan,

14:27.800 --> 14:30.880
that Nick guy who I haven't talked to, but he was there.

14:30.880 --> 14:32.840
Matt joined us for later matches.

14:32.840 --> 14:33.680
And was that it?

14:33.680 --> 14:34.880
It was like seven of us.

14:34.880 --> 14:37.600
And so after Matt joins, he hooks up his soundboard

14:37.600 --> 14:40.080
and he's playing like all these Duke Nukem sounds

14:40.080 --> 14:45.000
through my speaker, like, oh yeah, and all these things.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.640
Like, I'm just like, God damn it.

14:46.640 --> 14:48.280
Everybody's laughing so hard,

14:48.280 --> 14:50.200
partially because I think most of them were drunk.

14:50.200 --> 14:51.600
Like I think John and Nick were drunk.

14:51.600 --> 14:52.680
I don't know.

14:52.680 --> 14:54.880
But so we had fun and I was running around.

14:54.880 --> 14:57.200
Like I didn't know what I was doing, but I figured it out.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.040
Like at first I was like, why can't I jump?

14:59.040 --> 15:00.080
And I'm like, oh, that's right.

15:00.080 --> 15:00.920
It's Perfect Dark.

15:00.920 --> 15:02.440
You can't jump at Perfect Dark.

15:02.440 --> 15:05.960
And I can't hate on it because you can't really jump in.

15:05.960 --> 15:08.080
No, you could jump in Quake.

15:08.080 --> 15:09.680
Could you jump in Doom?

15:09.680 --> 15:10.880
No, you couldn't jump in Doom.

15:10.880 --> 15:12.120
So, okay.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.480
So I'm just like, okay, I have to approach this like Doom,

15:13.480 --> 15:16.760
but you can and I figured out you can walk in the ladders

15:16.760 --> 15:18.000
and go up ladders that way.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.320
Like I figured that out after a few minutes.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.960
And it was cool cause I got to like punch John

15:22.960 --> 15:25.360
in the face a couple of times and it was fun.

15:25.360 --> 15:26.200
It was fun.

15:26.200 --> 15:27.960
And then there was this weird like clipping thing

15:27.960 --> 15:31.520
that happened where somehow I ended up below Alan

15:31.520 --> 15:33.040
whose character was on top of me

15:33.040 --> 15:35.720
and I was punching him in the vagina repeatedly.

15:35.720 --> 15:37.400
Cause I had no gun.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.800
So it was like, I was just punching him in the skirt region.

15:39.800 --> 15:40.640
And did I kill you?

15:40.640 --> 15:41.480
I don't know.

15:41.480 --> 15:43.080
I think, I think finally you like thought to look down

15:43.080 --> 15:43.920
and shoot me in the head.

15:43.920 --> 15:44.760
Yeah.

15:44.760 --> 15:45.580
And I died.

15:45.580 --> 15:46.420
It was sad.

15:46.420 --> 15:48.280
So, but Perfect Dark was fun.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.720
We had a blast playing that last night, actually.

15:49.720 --> 15:50.880
It was, it was $10 well spent.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.960
So I understand why people are all excited

15:52.960 --> 15:55.480
cause it's, it's, it's a good multiplayer game.

15:55.480 --> 15:56.560
Like everybody was having fun.

15:56.560 --> 15:58.040
I felt bad for Alan

15:58.040 --> 15:59.840
cause I only have the one wireless headset.

15:59.840 --> 16:00.760
So I had that on.

16:00.760 --> 16:03.040
And even though I had the mode on where you can, you know,

16:03.040 --> 16:06.760
on your 360, you can do headphone and speakers.

16:06.760 --> 16:08.480
You can't hear shit through the speakers.

16:08.480 --> 16:09.300
You can't.

16:09.300 --> 16:10.140
Like I think Alan,

16:10.140 --> 16:12.160
could you hear anything at all coming through the speakers?

16:12.160 --> 16:13.400
Yeah. Well the,

16:13.400 --> 16:15.000
them talking through the TV speakers

16:15.000 --> 16:17.320
along with the game effects, not really.

16:17.320 --> 16:18.720
Like you can kind of tell people are talking,

16:18.720 --> 16:20.680
but I had no idea what was going on.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.000
And Matt's in chat right now going,

16:22.000 --> 16:24.600
although Rob used his boyfriend as a decoy several times.

16:24.600 --> 16:27.680
Well, what we thought to do later on is we were like,

16:27.680 --> 16:28.500
is that you?

16:28.500 --> 16:29.340
Yeah. Is that you?

16:29.340 --> 16:31.040
Okay. Let's walk around together and try to find John.

16:31.040 --> 16:33.800
And it's and assault him that way.

16:33.800 --> 16:35.160
But that, that didn't work out very well.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.720
Well, I was running around unarmed

16:37.720 --> 16:39.940
just so that people could shoot me.

16:39.940 --> 16:42.120
So I wasn't really playing for real,

16:42.120 --> 16:43.480
which is really sort of shitty.

16:43.480 --> 16:44.680
Oh, sure. Sure.

16:44.680 --> 16:47.400
Well, I had zero kills the last two matches.

16:47.400 --> 16:48.960
You were letting us win Alan.

16:48.960 --> 16:49.780
Of course.

16:49.780 --> 16:51.480
I was just running around being stupid.

16:52.760 --> 16:55.280
I don't like first person shooters on consoles.

16:55.280 --> 16:57.080
I'll bring in my other wireless communicator.

16:57.080 --> 16:58.660
Cause I have one of those.

16:58.660 --> 17:03.200
We, I brought it into our game room area at work

17:03.200 --> 17:05.360
so that we could talk to people

17:05.360 --> 17:07.120
and berate them if we wanted to.

17:07.120 --> 17:09.880
But instead my coworker decides to go ahead

17:09.880 --> 17:12.040
and take it and say, I'm Loki.

17:12.040 --> 17:14.320
I'm stupid.

17:14.320 --> 17:17.920
I'm like, okay, you're not having that anymore.

17:17.920 --> 17:18.760
Nice.

17:18.760 --> 17:20.560
I love you such and such player.

17:20.560 --> 17:22.160
It sounds very dark.

17:23.160 --> 17:24.600
I'm like damn you.

17:24.600 --> 17:25.440
Nice.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.040
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:28.040 --> 17:30.120
You hate first person shooters on consoles.

17:30.120 --> 17:31.880
Yeah. So I can do it,

17:31.880 --> 17:34.680
but I'm more of a stickler for the mouse and keyboard.

17:34.680 --> 17:36.520
So I was being stubborn.

17:36.520 --> 17:37.360
I was being stubborn.

17:37.360 --> 17:38.180
That's right.

17:38.180 --> 17:40.460
Because you're like a half-life geek.

17:40.460 --> 17:41.840
That's something I have to remember.

17:41.840 --> 17:43.960
You like half-life is like God to you, right?

17:43.960 --> 17:44.800
Yes.

17:44.800 --> 17:47.560
Okay. So all this other stuff is crap.

17:47.560 --> 17:48.640
All right.

17:48.640 --> 17:51.480
But have you ever played the orange box on 360

17:51.480 --> 17:53.400
or is that like sacrilege to you?

17:53.400 --> 17:54.880
I downloaded the demo for it,

17:54.880 --> 17:58.040
which is the beginning of half-life episode two on the 360,

17:58.040 --> 18:00.440
just to, you know, played it for about half hour.

18:00.440 --> 18:02.280
Decided I didn't like the controls.

18:02.280 --> 18:04.200
Okay. So you're one of those PC elitists.

18:04.200 --> 18:05.040
That's fine.

18:05.040 --> 18:05.920
That's cool.

18:05.920 --> 18:06.960
All right. So other gaming week.

18:06.960 --> 18:09.080
So then we played rock band.

18:09.080 --> 18:10.600
We finally got around to playing the Gaga songs

18:10.600 --> 18:11.440
in a rock band.

18:11.440 --> 18:12.960
And I'll say this cause I sent it to Bobby on his show.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.000
Cause he was talking about how he bought

18:14.000 --> 18:16.160
the Eric Cartman poker face.

18:16.160 --> 18:18.880
That poker face Cartman thing is the kind of thing

18:18.880 --> 18:20.680
that's like funny once.

18:20.680 --> 18:22.880
Like I couldn't see myself playing that song over

18:22.880 --> 18:23.720
and over again.

18:23.720 --> 18:24.680
Cause I liked the song.

18:24.680 --> 18:26.160
Like it's funny once,

18:26.160 --> 18:28.880
but if you have a lot of people that come to your house

18:28.880 --> 18:31.920
to play rock band, like you throw the rock band parties,

18:31.920 --> 18:33.400
it's, you know, it's going to,

18:33.400 --> 18:35.880
somebody inevitably is going to pull that song up

18:35.880 --> 18:38.160
at a party and go, I want to sing the Cartman poker face.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.200
Ah ha ha ha.

18:39.200 --> 18:42.560
But we played it once and we were like, ha ha next.

18:42.560 --> 18:44.760
Well, you can at least do like a South Park medley

18:44.760 --> 18:46.640
at least now cause you've got a couple songs.

18:46.640 --> 18:47.480
Timmy, right?

18:47.480 --> 18:48.320
Yeah.

18:48.320 --> 18:49.400
And then we, then we squealed

18:49.400 --> 18:51.840
cause we were able to play bad romance.

18:51.840 --> 18:52.680
Let's see.

18:52.680 --> 18:54.840
Ah, then what else today?

18:54.840 --> 18:57.480
Okay. So today, what did we do?

18:57.480 --> 18:58.800
We fired up the 360 and I don't know,

18:58.800 --> 19:00.240
do we have intention on playing anything?

19:00.240 --> 19:01.080
I think we were like,

19:01.080 --> 19:02.800
let's find something co-op that we can both play.

19:02.800 --> 19:03.640
Yeah. Right.

19:03.640 --> 19:04.960
So I'm looking through my game collection

19:04.960 --> 19:07.040
and we get to beautiful Katamari and I'm like,

19:07.040 --> 19:07.880
you know what?

19:07.880 --> 19:09.040
I didn't play this game that much

19:09.040 --> 19:10.080
cause I didn't really like it,

19:10.080 --> 19:12.120
but I hear it has co-op and versus.

19:12.120 --> 19:12.940
So let's try that.

19:12.940 --> 19:14.720
Cause maybe that'll make the game more fun.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.100
So we pop it in and by the way,

19:16.100 --> 19:18.120
I don't have a second PS3 controller.

19:18.120 --> 19:19.880
So we had to do 360 today.

19:19.880 --> 19:21.960
So just so you know.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.760
So we put in beautiful Katamari and I'm like,

19:23.760 --> 19:25.000
okay, let's do co-op mode.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.240
And I was kind of surprised.

19:26.240 --> 19:28.020
Oh, it's not split screen.

19:28.020 --> 19:30.540
Oh, we're controlling the same Katamari.

19:30.540 --> 19:32.840
So Alan and I are trying to play

19:32.840 --> 19:36.960
and we just keep rolling the Katamari in a giant circle.

19:36.960 --> 19:40.800
Like, and there's nothing on the screen to tell you

19:40.800 --> 19:42.700
like so-and-so is tilting the wrong way.

19:42.700 --> 19:45.160
It's just, it was bad.

19:45.160 --> 19:46.400
Like there was nothing to do.

19:46.400 --> 19:48.600
It just splits the twin stick controls

19:48.600 --> 19:49.860
between the two people.

19:49.860 --> 19:52.600
And it's, yeah, I wasn't feeling it at all.

19:52.600 --> 19:53.440
No, it was terrible.

19:53.440 --> 19:54.960
After like 30 seconds, Alan was like,

19:54.960 --> 19:56.480
turn it off, turn it off.

19:56.480 --> 19:57.960
So he decided to do versus.

19:57.960 --> 19:58.800
Cause it's like, okay,

19:58.800 --> 20:00.360
I've seen a picture of a split screen

20:00.360 --> 20:01.460
on the back of the box.

20:01.460 --> 20:06.160
I know this has to have like a two player true mode in it.

20:06.160 --> 20:08.560
Sure enough versus is split screen.

20:08.560 --> 20:10.120
And when we were going to the stage select,

20:10.120 --> 20:11.040
we're like, oh, home.

20:11.040 --> 20:11.880
I'm like, okay, cool.

20:11.880 --> 20:13.760
It's going to be like, who can make the biggest Katamari?

20:13.760 --> 20:14.580
This will be fun.

20:14.580 --> 20:16.180
Okay, now this will be great.

20:16.180 --> 20:19.960
No, the battle was roll up the most clothes pins

20:19.960 --> 20:21.720
in one minute, go.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.960
And it's like this generically square playing field

20:24.960 --> 20:26.880
with a bunch of clothes pins.

20:26.880 --> 20:28.560
And it was roll up as many as you can.

20:28.560 --> 20:31.640
And he tried to crash into the other Katamari once in a

20:31.640 --> 20:33.160
while and make them lose clothes pins.

20:33.160 --> 20:36.680
And so we play that and I was like, this is not fun.

20:36.680 --> 20:38.620
So we decided to play the world.

20:38.620 --> 20:40.480
I'm like, okay, let's do the hardest stage

20:40.480 --> 20:41.600
and see what it is.

20:41.600 --> 20:45.040
So it was now you're in a much bigger square playing field

20:45.040 --> 20:47.320
and you're going to roll up houses.

20:47.320 --> 20:48.600
And I was like, this is shit.

20:48.600 --> 20:50.720
Like I think I literally said after it was over

20:50.720 --> 20:52.160
and it's not just because Alan beat me,

20:52.160 --> 20:53.200
but I was like, this is shit.

20:53.200 --> 20:54.200
And I threw my controller down.

20:54.200 --> 20:55.080
It was shit.

20:55.080 --> 20:56.060
It was not fun.

20:56.060 --> 20:58.640
Like a versus Katamari game should be so much better.

20:58.640 --> 21:00.800
I don't know if they got it right on PS3.

21:00.800 --> 21:03.320
You know, I, even in the single player mode,

21:03.320 --> 21:05.400
the PS3 is the better game than the 360.

21:05.400 --> 21:07.780
And that has nothing to do with the consoles themselves.

21:07.780 --> 21:09.600
Don't start the console wars with me.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.120
It's just that for what, you know,

21:11.120 --> 21:13.400
beautiful Katamari came first and they made mistakes.

21:13.400 --> 21:15.200
So maybe they fixed them with the PS3 one.

21:15.200 --> 21:18.320
I don't know, but the PS3 Katamari forever

21:18.320 --> 21:21.060
or whatever is superior to the 360 one.

21:21.060 --> 21:24.800
Now I haven't even played the co-op or versus.

21:24.800 --> 21:29.200
So after that was terrible, we decided to go into arcade.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.660
And we were just kind of looking through arcade games

21:30.660 --> 21:32.720
to play and I was like, okay, Alan, what do you want to play?

21:32.720 --> 21:34.040
Like, what don't you have yourself?

21:34.040 --> 21:35.720
And he's like, oh, you have double dragon.

21:35.720 --> 21:36.560
Let's play that.

21:36.560 --> 21:37.400
I'm like, okay.

21:37.400 --> 21:40.200
Like I think I played this for like five seconds

21:40.200 --> 21:42.040
when I first downloaded it back when I would just

21:42.040 --> 21:44.260
download arcade games to download them.

21:44.260 --> 21:47.400
Like you saw how many arcade games I have on 360, right?

21:47.400 --> 21:50.920
It's and then you cry thinking of all the starving children

21:50.920 --> 21:52.720
that I could have fed with that money, yeah.

21:52.720 --> 21:57.720
So we go into play double dragon and I don't know, Alan,

21:57.920 --> 21:59.680
can you, it's.

21:59.680 --> 22:01.960
That game does not stand to the test of time.

22:01.960 --> 22:04.680
That game is terrible.

22:04.680 --> 22:06.220
It's terrible.

22:06.220 --> 22:08.720
I feel bad for all of the $5 bills

22:08.720 --> 22:11.360
that I extorted from my mother and grandmother.

22:11.360 --> 22:12.680
This game's really hard at the, you know,

22:12.680 --> 22:16.080
at the arcade little nine year old me playing a bad game.

22:17.000 --> 22:17.940
It's awful.

22:17.940 --> 22:20.000
It's one of those games I think we really see

22:20.000 --> 22:22.200
through rose colored glasses or whatever they call it.

22:22.200 --> 22:23.800
Like remember better from our childhood.

22:23.800 --> 22:26.360
Like I, and I don't know if it's just the 360 port

22:26.360 --> 22:30.400
or whatever, but there's fricking slow down and flickering

22:30.400 --> 22:32.880
and the game is just fucking cheap.

22:32.880 --> 22:35.100
Like, like don't press down too much.

22:35.100 --> 22:36.640
You're going to fall off the edge.

22:36.640 --> 22:40.040
And it's like this horrible collision detection in the game

22:40.040 --> 22:42.560
and then finally, when we got to the end,

22:42.560 --> 22:45.940
we had to battle each other to see who got

22:45.940 --> 22:48.660
the big titty girl and it was like the worst fight

22:48.660 --> 22:51.320
in the entire world that we did.

22:51.320 --> 22:53.960
And finally I somehow won, even though Alan hit me

22:53.960 --> 22:55.880
with a baseball bat like 50 times,

22:55.880 --> 22:58.340
all I did was I had to pull his hair a few times and I won.

22:58.340 --> 23:00.580
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that the three punches

23:00.580 --> 23:02.840
does way more damage than the baseball bat

23:02.840 --> 23:04.280
because I hit you about eight times.

23:04.280 --> 23:06.760
Yeah, so we played our way through double dragon

23:06.760 --> 23:08.640
and we were like, what the hell are we thinking as children?

23:08.640 --> 23:11.180
This game was better, it was better on the NES, honestly.

23:11.180 --> 23:13.180
I would rather play the NES version of double dragon

23:13.180 --> 23:14.760
than the 360 version and that's awesome.

23:14.760 --> 23:15.680
The NES version was awesome.

23:15.680 --> 23:17.480
Yeah, although now I'm worried.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.480
I'm like, God, I wonder if I'm just remembering

23:19.480 --> 23:21.640
that one more fondly than I deserve to or what.

23:21.640 --> 23:25.000
No, it's just like Contra, like Contra on the arcade.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.860
I didn't really care for it, but on the NES it was cool.

23:27.860 --> 23:30.400
Vidpower in chat says 50,000,

23:30.400 --> 23:33.000
you scored 50,000 points on double dragon

23:33.000 --> 23:34.840
from the movie The Wizard.

23:34.840 --> 23:37.640
Dude, if you can score like 50,000 points on double dragon,

23:37.640 --> 23:39.160
that actually is really impressive.

23:39.160 --> 23:41.560
Like I have a lot of respect for a gamer that can do that

23:41.560 --> 23:44.520
now after seeing how fucking cheap that game is.

23:44.520 --> 23:47.200
Like I kid you not, the last boss will shoot you

23:47.200 --> 23:50.500
in the back with a gun and you will die instantly.

23:50.500 --> 23:52.360
Insert quarter to continue.

23:53.280 --> 23:55.700
Like what the hell, no wonder they removed that game

23:55.700 --> 23:58.100
from Xbox Live Marketplace, it was bad.

23:58.100 --> 24:00.560
So then I said to Alan, I was like, well fuck it,

24:00.560 --> 24:02.720
let's just make it a bad game day.

24:02.720 --> 24:05.760
And so that's when I reached for Fusion Frenzy 2.

24:05.760 --> 24:08.560
Yes, the game I spent $60 on when it first came out,

24:08.560 --> 24:10.220
I decided to pop it in because I'm like, Alan, no,

24:10.220 --> 24:13.540
you have to see how fucking terrible this game is.

24:13.540 --> 24:15.640
So we played like what, for, which by the way,

24:15.640 --> 24:17.840
if you've never played Fusion Frenzy 2,

24:17.840 --> 24:20.440
it's kind of like Xbox's answer to Mario Party,

24:20.440 --> 24:23.040
but with a more like science fiction future theme.

24:23.040 --> 24:26.320
So we flew to the planet Moisture to do some battle

24:26.320 --> 24:27.160
in some water.

24:27.160 --> 24:29.020
No one should ever fly to the planet Moisture.

24:29.020 --> 24:32.480
To do some battle in some water themed stages.

24:32.480 --> 24:34.940
And Alan, what were your thoughts on Fusion Frenzy 2?

24:34.940 --> 24:37.380
It was emotional abuse and I'm upset

24:37.380 --> 24:38.980
and I need to call a shelter.

24:40.240 --> 24:42.260
Gamer's spouse abuse.

24:44.080 --> 24:45.520
What was so bad about it?

24:46.880 --> 24:51.200
Just the host was in like his pink jumpsuit

24:51.200 --> 24:53.960
with the spiky hair and you could tell that it was sort of,

24:53.960 --> 24:55.920
you know, edgy, like designed by committee.

24:55.920 --> 24:59.160
And it was really just sort of the showgirls of party games,

24:59.160 --> 25:01.000
but without any of the breasts or anything

25:01.000 --> 25:02.360
that makes showgirls great.

25:02.360 --> 25:05.400
It was awful.

25:05.400 --> 25:07.440
Dude, showgirls of party games be awesome.

25:09.440 --> 25:10.360
Wait, wait, Dan, Dan, Dan,

25:10.360 --> 25:11.600
we got to get Dan on mic with that.

25:11.600 --> 25:14.000
Can you hand Dan the mic real quick?

25:14.000 --> 25:17.080
My Double Dragon score is 68,920.

25:17.080 --> 25:18.280
Can I shake your hand, sir?

25:18.280 --> 25:19.200
I want to shake your hand.

25:19.200 --> 25:21.120
You are a gaming stud, sir, Dan.

25:21.120 --> 25:21.960
Now, Dan.

25:21.960 --> 25:22.780
I have to say for the record,

25:22.780 --> 25:24.600
I'm listening to you guys talking here.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.500
Your opinions about games are all crap.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.720
The arcade Contra is awesome.

25:29.720 --> 25:31.280
I like Contra.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.440
Double Dragon rules.

25:32.440 --> 25:33.280
Wait, wait, wait.

25:33.280 --> 25:34.440
When did I say shit about Contra?

25:34.440 --> 25:35.280
I did.

25:35.280 --> 25:36.120
Oh, you did.

25:36.120 --> 25:36.940
Loki did.

25:36.940 --> 25:37.780
Well, fuck Loki.

25:37.780 --> 25:38.620
All right.

25:38.620 --> 25:39.600
Double Dragon rules.

25:39.600 --> 25:41.560
Double Dragon sucks.

25:41.560 --> 25:42.920
It has slow down.

25:42.920 --> 25:44.240
It has flicker.

25:44.240 --> 25:45.460
It's cheap.

25:45.460 --> 25:47.240
The weapons don't do shit.

25:47.240 --> 25:48.200
Yeah.

25:48.200 --> 25:49.760
It's all about the elbow punch.

25:50.840 --> 25:51.800
But you are right.

25:51.800 --> 25:54.040
There are no good Katamari games except for the first one.

25:54.040 --> 25:55.000
What other games?

25:55.000 --> 25:56.760
I will say this, to Double Dragon's credit,

25:56.760 --> 25:59.480
there are no other games where you get assaulted

25:59.480 --> 26:02.160
by transsexual bitches carrying whips.

26:02.160 --> 26:04.080
Like no other game do the trannies come out

26:04.080 --> 26:05.640
and force you to try to kick your ass.

26:05.640 --> 26:07.420
Like I can't, I can't think of any.

26:07.420 --> 26:08.520
Streets of Rage 2.

26:08.520 --> 26:13.520
Yeah, very good point, yes.

26:13.720 --> 26:14.880
Fine.

26:14.880 --> 26:17.320
Yet again, I get upstaged by Dan on this fine program.

26:17.320 --> 26:18.160
Fine.

26:18.160 --> 26:19.480
OrangeLawnsRadio.com.

26:19.480 --> 26:20.560
All right, let's see.

26:20.560 --> 26:21.380
So what else?

26:21.380 --> 26:23.400
What capped off our bad game day?

26:23.400 --> 26:24.240
Oh yes.

26:24.240 --> 26:26.400
I told Alan, I said, okay.

26:26.400 --> 26:30.240
I said, this game is literally worse than Yaris.

26:30.240 --> 26:31.840
And Alan goes, Yaris?

26:31.840 --> 26:32.680
Like the car?

26:32.680 --> 26:33.520
That's a car.

26:33.520 --> 26:34.340
That's a car, right?

26:34.340 --> 26:36.680
And I'm like, yeah, it's a car,

26:36.680 --> 26:38.840
but don't you know the game Yaris?

26:38.840 --> 26:41.000
And he's like, no, they made a game out of Yaris.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.840
I'm like, turn off the,

26:42.840 --> 26:45.040
we gotta go to the arcade right now

26:45.040 --> 26:47.080
and play Yaris right now.

26:47.080 --> 26:49.200
And the minute you launch the game Yaris,

26:49.200 --> 26:51.400
for those that forgot because it's been a few years

26:51.400 --> 26:53.400
and I'm gonna bring back all your haunting memories

26:53.400 --> 26:54.220
of the past.

26:54.220 --> 26:57.160
The game starts with a Yaris like driving,

26:57.160 --> 26:59.500
or no, no, there's like a little robot spider on the ground

26:59.500 --> 27:02.560
and then it pans out and a big Yaris drives in

27:02.560 --> 27:04.940
and a robot claw comes out of the hood

27:04.940 --> 27:07.140
and like zaps the robot spider.

27:07.140 --> 27:10.520
And I look over at Alan and Alan just has this like,

27:10.520 --> 27:11.360
what?

27:11.360 --> 27:12.200
Look on his face.

27:12.200 --> 27:14.160
I thought it was like a Pixar intro,

27:14.160 --> 27:16.400
like a cute car animation.

27:16.400 --> 27:18.400
Like, all right, this is the opening sequence of the game.

27:18.400 --> 27:19.300
No, that is the game.

27:19.300 --> 27:23.140
You're shooting, you're shooting little gas pump spiders.

27:23.140 --> 27:26.640
Yeah, so then I made Alan, I made him play a race.

27:26.640 --> 27:28.920
I was like, no, you need to play a really bad game

27:28.920 --> 27:29.760
and see what this is like.

27:29.760 --> 27:31.600
So I made him play a race and that's when he started going,

27:31.600 --> 27:33.240
this is rape, this is emotional rape.

27:33.240 --> 27:35.080
I don't like it, this is bad.

27:35.080 --> 27:39.300
And then, yeah, so what'd you think of Yaris?

27:40.660 --> 27:44.280
I am very happy to hear that it was free.

27:46.600 --> 27:51.180
And for promotional purposes only, so.

27:51.180 --> 27:52.960
And then finally, once that was over,

27:52.960 --> 27:55.640
I redeemed myself with some Fatal Fury special.

27:55.640 --> 27:56.980
So I got something good in.

27:56.980 --> 27:59.360
And not only is it bad in the fact that the game

27:59.360 --> 28:02.480
is just horrible and of poor quality,

28:02.480 --> 28:04.680
it also is bad in the fact that it led the way

28:04.680 --> 28:09.560
to pirating Xbox Live arcade games on modified consoles.

28:09.560 --> 28:11.060
Thank you, Yaris exploit.

28:13.120 --> 28:13.960
All right, that's-

28:13.960 --> 28:16.220
So there is no good redeeming value about that game

28:16.220 --> 28:18.520
other than the fact that it can make the bottoms

28:18.520 --> 28:20.680
of worse lists and stuff like that.

28:20.680 --> 28:25.200
Um, yeah, I don't know what else to say about that.

28:25.200 --> 28:26.440
I mean, it's kind of funny though,

28:26.440 --> 28:28.440
because we also, somehow we forgot to mention,

28:28.440 --> 28:29.840
we were playing Puzzle Fighter II

28:29.840 --> 28:30.660
over the weekends on my own.

28:30.660 --> 28:32.840
That's a game by Backbone Entertainment, did that game.

28:32.840 --> 28:34.620
They also did Yaris, and you're kind of like,

28:34.620 --> 28:36.600
my, my, how the mighty have fallen.

28:38.220 --> 28:40.280
But I guess everybody's allowed one crappy title,

28:40.280 --> 28:41.120
I don't know.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.400
I randomly played Boom Boom Rocket again today too.

28:43.400 --> 28:45.080
I don't know, I realized I was missing

28:45.080 --> 28:47.120
one stinking achievement in that game.

28:47.120 --> 28:49.080
So I kind of went back to go see if I could get it

28:49.080 --> 28:51.300
and it involved playing some very hard songs.

28:51.300 --> 28:53.160
But apparently I'm still number one on my friends list.

28:53.160 --> 28:54.000
Woo!

28:54.000 --> 28:56.160
So I don't know, I'll have to go in

28:56.160 --> 28:57.360
and try to play that a little more.

28:57.360 --> 29:00.880
Cause I, the last time I had played Boom Boom Rocket

29:00.880 --> 29:02.640
was probably two and a half years ago.

29:02.640 --> 29:06.120
So, anyhow, let's get into some gaming news here

29:06.120 --> 29:07.560
and some housekeeping.

29:07.560 --> 29:09.280
Real quick, of course, if DarkSakura was here,

29:09.280 --> 29:10.920
you know, she's not here to tell you about her gaming week,

29:10.920 --> 29:12.680
but I'm sure she would say something like,

29:12.680 --> 29:16.940
I played Star Trek Online and Pagle on my iPhone.

29:16.940 --> 29:19.200
And yeah, all right.

29:19.200 --> 29:22.600
Anyhow, we'll let her talk about her gaming week

29:22.600 --> 29:23.600
when she gets here.

29:23.600 --> 29:24.640
Housekeeping tonight.

29:25.680 --> 29:27.120
First off, I want to give a big thank you

29:27.120 --> 29:30.320
to some of the people behind the scenes at OLR.

29:30.320 --> 29:31.560
I mean, obviously we have a lot of people

29:31.560 --> 29:33.360
behind the scenes that make things work.

29:33.360 --> 29:36.200
Deep Man and VX JasonXV who do the website.

29:36.200 --> 29:38.240
But also Dark Tetsuya does a lot of work

29:38.240 --> 29:40.840
for kind of like writing on the website once in a while.

29:40.840 --> 29:42.800
And I know Act F does some work with him as well.

29:42.800 --> 29:45.680
And I know Dark Tetsuya and Misty kind of got together

29:45.680 --> 29:49.680
for this side project that is the OLR best hits.

29:49.680 --> 29:52.360
And it's the greatest hits, if you will,

29:52.360 --> 29:54.080
of like our first 20 episodes.

29:54.080 --> 29:55.240
And when I mean our first 20 episodes,

29:55.240 --> 29:59.760
I mean the first 20 episodes from 2002

30:00.880 --> 30:03.080
back when we talked about nothing but DDR.

30:03.080 --> 30:05.900
So it's done, it's up, and you can download it.

30:05.900 --> 30:07.880
The only thing I want to warn you about,

30:07.880 --> 30:10.400
it was a totally different show back then.

30:10.400 --> 30:14.080
And also something that I think they didn't mention

30:14.080 --> 30:16.080
in the audio, which is fine.

30:16.080 --> 30:20.160
But when we started the show, our live 365 feed,

30:20.160 --> 30:21.460
because you know the all games partnership

30:21.460 --> 30:25.200
didn't happen till like 06-ish, 07 maybe?

30:25.200 --> 30:26.840
I can't, gosh, time flies.

30:26.840 --> 30:28.720
But so when we first started our show,

30:28.720 --> 30:31.760
we were on our own live 365 station.

30:31.760 --> 30:36.200
And we were running a modem friendly, dial up friendly,

30:36.200 --> 30:38.040
56K friendly radio stream.

30:38.040 --> 30:40.960
So the audio quality was not that great.

30:40.960 --> 30:43.040
So I just want to warn you, if you're gonna go check it out,

30:43.040 --> 30:45.080
keep in mind, the audio may hurt your ears a little bit

30:45.080 --> 30:46.700
because it was dial up friendly.

30:46.700 --> 30:48.000
But if you want to hear the kind of stuff

30:48.000 --> 30:50.120
we talked about a year ago, it's pretty cool.

30:50.120 --> 30:50.960
So I really want to-

30:50.960 --> 30:51.780
A year ago.

30:51.780 --> 30:52.920
I'm sorry, years ago.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.760
I want to thank Dartisia for putting that together.

30:56.760 --> 30:59.000
It's pretty funny.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.280
All right, you can find that at orangelaundraded.com.

31:01.280 --> 31:02.880
It's right there on the front page.

31:03.880 --> 31:05.180
Other housekeeping tonight.

31:05.180 --> 31:07.440
We do have a list list coming up in part B tonight

31:07.440 --> 31:10.180
because it is our 360th episode.

31:10.180 --> 31:13.480
So we have a list list tipping our hat to the Xbox 360

31:13.480 --> 31:14.080
tonight.

31:14.080 --> 31:16.760
So we'll get into that a little later on in the show in part

31:16.760 --> 31:19.080
B. But if you want to vote, you have

31:19.080 --> 31:23.120
to be in our chat room, chat.orangelaundraded.com.

31:23.120 --> 31:25.280
All right, let's get into some actual gaming news.

31:25.280 --> 31:26.920
Because Alan and I have been talking

31:26.920 --> 31:28.640
about a lot of old games.

31:28.640 --> 31:31.240
So let's get into some new games and, oddly enough,

31:31.240 --> 31:32.160
some 360 news.

31:32.160 --> 31:33.080
Yes, Loki?

31:33.080 --> 31:36.320
Yes, this week we had some images leak out

31:36.320 --> 31:40.240
of a possible slimmed down 360.

31:40.240 --> 31:44.520
And much like images leaked out before of a 360

31:44.520 --> 31:49.480
with an HDMI port on it, I have to say this is probably

31:49.480 --> 31:50.640
going to happen too.

31:50.640 --> 31:53.000
And it kind of coincides with a lot of other stuff

31:53.000 --> 31:55.260
we'll probably be talking about a little bit later.

31:55.260 --> 32:01.280
But it shows, obviously, there's a couple new internal plugs

32:01.280 --> 32:03.480
for SATA cords and stuff like that.

32:03.480 --> 32:06.140
So it's thought that perhaps the hard drive is

32:06.140 --> 32:09.020
going to be internal, much like the PS3.

32:09.020 --> 32:12.680
Also, they've combined the GPU and CPU into one chip.

32:12.680 --> 32:16.080
And it's got an actual kind of a different cooling system now,

32:16.080 --> 32:20.320
just more like a traditional heat sink and fan.

32:20.320 --> 32:24.040
Also, the memory card slot is missing.

32:24.040 --> 32:25.720
But once again, that kind of gets

32:25.720 --> 32:28.760
into something we'll be talking about probably

32:28.760 --> 32:31.200
a little bit later.

32:31.200 --> 32:32.280
But it's interesting.

32:32.280 --> 32:33.480
And I have a feeling this is probably

32:33.480 --> 32:35.160
going to be out by the end of this year.

32:35.160 --> 32:36.840
I will bet you anything.

32:36.840 --> 32:40.840
Probably around the same time as Project Natal.

32:40.840 --> 32:41.600
Yeah, definitely.

32:41.600 --> 32:43.640
I think it'll come out in conjunction with Natal.

32:43.640 --> 32:45.240
I bet it'll be announced at E3.

32:45.240 --> 32:47.040
Do you think Natal's built into this thing?

32:47.040 --> 32:47.800
No.

32:47.800 --> 32:48.640
I don't think it is.

32:48.640 --> 32:50.960
I think it's going to be just an accessory.

32:50.960 --> 32:53.760
I just think the system's going to be slimmed down kind

32:53.760 --> 32:57.560
of to appeal to more of like the Wii crowd type thing.

32:57.560 --> 33:00.360
Maybe they're going to drop the price on it or something.

33:00.360 --> 33:02.040
Now what's the source of these pictures?

33:02.040 --> 33:03.960
Because I want to try and figure out how true this is.

33:03.960 --> 33:05.540
Because remember guys, this is a rumor.

33:05.540 --> 33:07.640
So what's the source of these pictures?

33:07.640 --> 33:11.720
The source, it's apparently from some Chinese tech forum.

33:11.720 --> 33:16.760
Apparently it was, I'm thinking that it's probably

33:16.760 --> 33:19.080
leaked from some sort of production line.

33:19.080 --> 33:24.040
The same type of forum leaked up some other revisions of.

33:24.040 --> 33:27.120
Yeah, I seem to remember the first PS3 slim info

33:27.120 --> 33:28.920
was coming from an Asian web forum.

33:28.920 --> 33:32.400
Because that's what the factory was making some of the parts.

33:32.400 --> 33:32.880
Yeah.

33:32.880 --> 33:34.200
And there's some things on here.

33:34.200 --> 33:37.480
I mean, you'll notice there's like developer headers

33:37.480 --> 33:41.000
on there, these on the current 360s

33:41.000 --> 33:43.800
are where people do the JTAG exploits and stuff like that.

33:43.800 --> 33:46.560
Obviously this will probably be fixed on this console

33:46.560 --> 33:48.720
when it comes out.

33:48.720 --> 33:51.600
Stuff like that and different like power headers and whatnot

33:51.600 --> 33:54.720
that are, I mean this one looks like the CD-ROM or the DVD

33:54.720 --> 33:56.320
drive and then probably they're going

33:56.320 --> 33:59.880
to have one that's going to plug into the SATA drive

33:59.880 --> 34:01.160
if it's going to be internal.

34:01.160 --> 34:03.440
So it's interesting.

34:03.440 --> 34:06.800
OK, so Loki, on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being this

34:06.800 --> 34:09.640
is a fucking lie and 10 being this is fucking happening.

34:09.640 --> 34:10.680
How true is this rumor?

34:10.680 --> 34:12.200
I'd say it's probably 10.

34:12.200 --> 34:14.800
That's a pretty big bet, all right.

34:14.800 --> 34:17.080
Well, it's where there's smoke, there's fire.

34:17.080 --> 34:19.880
And yeah, I realize that we're only a few weeks away

34:19.880 --> 34:21.600
from April Fool's Day, but come on.

34:21.600 --> 34:24.000
I mean, it just makes sense that they would do this.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.680
And like I said, with the other news that's coming out,

34:26.680 --> 34:29.640
it makes sense why certain things are missing from this.

34:29.640 --> 34:32.040
So yeah.

34:32.040 --> 34:34.520
Spyro in our chat room, chat.orangelandrater.com

34:34.520 --> 34:36.520
says, we already have normal 360s.

34:36.520 --> 34:38.280
We don't need slimmer ones.

34:38.280 --> 34:40.040
Yeah, that's what the PS3 people said too,

34:40.040 --> 34:41.760
but now they have slim PS3s.

34:41.760 --> 34:43.320
And it was the best move they made.

34:43.320 --> 34:47.000
Well, they made the cost of the console cheaper

34:47.000 --> 34:49.080
by consolidating some parts and taking

34:49.080 --> 34:51.600
some things that weren't really used very commonly out.

34:51.600 --> 34:54.520
What did they take out of the other PS3 model?

34:54.520 --> 34:55.040
Was it USB?

34:55.040 --> 34:57.120
They took out USB ports and stuff like that.

34:57.120 --> 35:08.160
But yeah, it's just slimmer dies and parts get cheaper.

35:08.160 --> 35:09.540
Well, and that's my other thought

35:09.540 --> 35:12.560
is that, OK, part of why I think there is a lot of truth

35:12.560 --> 35:14.360
to this is that it makes sense that they're trying to

35:14.360 --> 35:16.520
consolidate some of the parts because you're talking

35:16.520 --> 35:17.520
about a price reduction.

35:17.520 --> 35:20.480
Because how awesome would it be if Microsoft

35:20.480 --> 35:23.960
gets the price low enough where they can launch a 360

35:23.960 --> 35:27.640
console with Natal for $199?

35:27.640 --> 35:30.520
So that's what they charge for their low-end 360 now, right?

35:30.520 --> 35:31.360
$199?

35:31.360 --> 35:34.400
What if they could do that with Natal for $199?

35:34.400 --> 35:38.080
I mean, that's a pretty big kick in the pants to Nintendo

35:38.080 --> 35:39.440
come this Christmas season.

35:39.440 --> 35:43.040
Although if that were to happen, it's not out of the question.

35:43.040 --> 35:46.920
Nintendo might say $99 a week.

35:46.920 --> 35:48.960
It might not make a difference.

35:48.960 --> 35:50.460
So I think right now at the point,

35:50.460 --> 35:52.800
I mean, $99 a week would be kind of cool

35:52.800 --> 35:54.040
because then people will be like, oh, yeah,

35:54.040 --> 35:55.240
I'm going to definitely pick up one of those.

35:55.240 --> 35:57.320
But picking up a system doesn't mean you're

35:57.320 --> 35:58.560
going to buy the games for it.

35:58.560 --> 36:00.400
I mean, look at all these people that

36:00.400 --> 36:03.080
bought just the Wii for Wii Sports.

36:03.080 --> 36:05.360
And that's all they're playing.

36:05.360 --> 36:07.180
And they're not buying Wii Sports Resort.

36:07.180 --> 36:08.760
And they're not buying anything else.

36:08.760 --> 36:11.560
They're just playing Wii Sports.

36:11.560 --> 36:15.440
Or like me, I haven't played the Wii in months.

36:15.440 --> 36:17.680
Neither have I. In fact, I was going to hook it up this week

36:17.680 --> 36:19.880
to play Rondo of Blood, which for some reason

36:19.880 --> 36:20.920
is on our show all night.

36:20.920 --> 36:24.040
It finally got its release on Monday, which is exciting.

36:24.040 --> 36:26.080
It's because Jamie's not here for part A tonight.

36:26.080 --> 36:27.360
So that's how we missed it.

36:27.360 --> 36:28.920
But Rondo of Blood came out.

36:28.920 --> 36:31.100
And I was like, oh, I should hook up the Wii and download it.

36:31.100 --> 36:33.600
But then I was like, let's play terrible games on the 360

36:33.600 --> 36:36.120
instead for whatever reason.

36:36.120 --> 36:38.400
So I don't know.

36:38.400 --> 36:40.240
Alan, I know you already own a 360.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.320
But do you think there's anything here

36:42.320 --> 36:46.080
that maybe somebody who already has a 360

36:46.080 --> 36:47.360
might want to get one of these?

36:47.360 --> 36:48.900
Do you think there's anything in here

36:48.900 --> 36:52.480
for us gamers that probably already have one?

36:52.480 --> 36:57.000
Maybe to trade up so that hopefully the Red Ring of Death

36:57.000 --> 36:58.840
isn't an issue.

36:58.840 --> 37:00.600
Well, the rumor is that these are going

37:00.600 --> 37:02.880
to be 45 nanometer chips.

37:02.880 --> 37:04.200
So those are pretty stable.

37:04.200 --> 37:06.720
I mean, heat wise, it uses a lot less electricity,

37:06.720 --> 37:07.880
a lot less heat.

37:07.880 --> 37:10.720
And it looks like the way that they have it right now,

37:10.720 --> 37:12.440
if it is going to be slimmer, it's

37:12.440 --> 37:16.240
literally going to be heat sink fan opening to the case.

37:16.240 --> 37:20.020
I mean, there's no elaborate ducting system

37:20.020 --> 37:22.160
with fans blowing air and stuff like that.

37:22.160 --> 37:25.880
It's just, it's straight out of the case.

37:25.880 --> 37:29.400
So I mean, I would assume it's going to be more stable.

37:29.400 --> 37:31.560
I mean, even the new consoles now are more stable.

37:31.560 --> 37:35.520
So there may be a little bit of bugs worked out.

37:35.520 --> 37:36.840
But we'll have to see.

37:36.840 --> 37:38.600
And hopefully they've learned their lesson.

37:38.600 --> 37:41.860
They're going to test their consoles quite a bit.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.480
I just think it's going to be interesting

37:43.480 --> 37:46.160
if they do decide to put an internal hard drive in there.

37:46.160 --> 37:48.440
Then I wonder if they're looking to say, hey,

37:48.440 --> 37:50.280
we're not going to try to make tons of money

37:50.280 --> 37:52.080
off these hard drives now.

37:52.080 --> 37:54.160
Because I would assume that maybe you

37:54.160 --> 37:56.400
can upgrade your own hard drives.

37:56.400 --> 37:58.600
And even if you can't, I mean, the modding community

37:58.600 --> 38:01.240
out there, now that it has the standard SATA ports on it,

38:01.240 --> 38:03.720
you're going to be able to upgrade your own hard drive.

38:03.720 --> 38:05.400
Out of curiosity, could this, you know,

38:05.400 --> 38:06.400
you brought up modding.

38:06.400 --> 38:09.240
And you've talked a lot about the different mods out there,

38:09.240 --> 38:11.460
like the J tags and so forth, the 360s.

38:11.460 --> 38:13.600
Do you think part of this is to combat modding?

38:13.600 --> 38:14.200
Maybe.

38:14.200 --> 38:16.320
I mean, because the J tags stuff right now,

38:16.320 --> 38:19.920
I mean, they've already patched it out.

38:19.920 --> 38:23.960
It's just you have to have an old enough,

38:23.960 --> 38:26.520
basically an old enough firmware to be able to run it.

38:26.520 --> 38:29.760
And a lot of the consoles now are,

38:29.760 --> 38:31.520
especially the ones being released now,

38:31.520 --> 38:33.680
have firmwares that you can't drop back down.

38:33.680 --> 38:37.220
But they're figuring out how to mod different consoles.

38:37.220 --> 38:40.440
Because there's the ones that had the old 16 megabyte,

38:40.440 --> 38:45.240
or yeah, the 16 megabyte NAND flash, now the ones

38:45.240 --> 38:47.880
that they've added, like the 256, the 512,

38:47.880 --> 38:51.200
to the newer consoles that they have actual onboard memory

38:51.200 --> 38:52.680
cards almost.

38:52.680 --> 38:55.880
Those now, they're figuring out how to mod as well.

38:55.880 --> 38:59.900
But a lot of them aren't with an old enough dashboard

38:59.900 --> 39:02.000
to be able to do it.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.640
I mean, I'm sure they're going to find a way to do something.

39:04.640 --> 39:06.440
At the very least, they're going to find

39:06.440 --> 39:08.800
ways to add a bigger hard drive if you want it.

39:08.800 --> 39:12.200
But they may actually, if they're smart,

39:12.200 --> 39:13.920
go the route of Sony and allow you

39:13.920 --> 39:15.800
to upgrade your own hard drive.

39:15.800 --> 39:16.680
Well, we'll see.

39:16.680 --> 39:18.680
Because I think we have another story coming up

39:18.680 --> 39:22.200
about further evidence that the Xbox 360 hard drives may

39:22.200 --> 39:23.200
be a thing of the past.

39:23.200 --> 39:25.720
But first, I want to get into another story about the 360,

39:25.720 --> 39:28.880
since it is episode 360 of our show, after all.

39:28.880 --> 39:30.320
Talking about a patent.

39:30.320 --> 39:31.320
Yes, that's right.

39:31.320 --> 39:33.160
Thanks to the US Patent Office and people

39:33.160 --> 39:35.480
having to file those patents to protect their ideas,

39:35.480 --> 39:38.720
sometimes we get spoiled on things that may or may not

39:38.720 --> 39:40.440
actually end up happening.

39:40.440 --> 39:42.440
I think we've seen patents in the past.

39:42.440 --> 39:44.520
Didn't Nintendo trademark like, or I

39:44.520 --> 39:45.840
mean, I guess there's a difference between trademark

39:45.840 --> 39:46.340
and patent.

39:46.340 --> 39:50.240
But for the purposes of rumor spoiling, it's very similar.

39:50.240 --> 39:53.760
Didn't they trademark like a bunch of names for that system

39:53.760 --> 39:55.280
that ended up being the Wii?

39:55.280 --> 39:57.240
You know, like a lot of times they do this.

39:57.240 --> 39:58.960
They trademark a bunch of ideas, just

39:58.960 --> 40:04.200
make sure there's no, God, those people that just like.

40:04.200 --> 40:05.080
Patent squatters.

40:05.080 --> 40:06.240
Patent squatters, thank you.

40:06.240 --> 40:07.240
Or trademark squatters.

40:07.240 --> 40:09.120
Yeah, that was looking for the people that,

40:09.120 --> 40:11.240
oh, we invented the rumble thing first,

40:11.240 --> 40:13.080
even though we never did anything with it.

40:13.080 --> 40:17.320
And all those people to try and get to the ideas before them.

40:17.320 --> 40:19.640
Well, anyhow, this, though, sounds very feasible to me.

40:19.640 --> 40:22.400
And this is a Microsoft patent that apparently was filed back

40:22.400 --> 40:25.560
in mid 2008.

40:25.560 --> 40:29.720
What would happen is that with this thing, this interface,

40:29.720 --> 40:32.000
I guess, that they're patenting, you would actually be able

40:32.000 --> 40:35.960
to download a game add-on from the Xbox Live Marketplace

40:35.960 --> 40:39.400
when an in-game prompt in the game tells you to do so.

40:39.400 --> 40:43.200
Believe it or not, that doesn't really happen right now.

40:43.200 --> 40:44.760
You know, the game will kind of say,

40:44.760 --> 40:46.720
especially if you're playing a demo,

40:46.720 --> 40:50.320
you can hit a button to kind of go to the Xbox Live store,

40:50.320 --> 40:51.960
but there's like some extra steps

40:51.960 --> 40:53.760
that you take before you actually purchase.

40:53.760 --> 40:54.920
And this sounds a little more to me

40:54.920 --> 40:57.640
like you would just be able to buy the add-on right there,

40:57.640 --> 41:00.640
practically with a touch of a button, if you had the.

41:00.640 --> 41:04.000
It would be like, for example, I was playing Borderlands

41:04.000 --> 41:06.520
and, you know, say my friend was playing

41:06.520 --> 41:07.760
and he wanted to join my game

41:07.760 --> 41:09.880
and he doesn't have the expansion that I have,

41:09.880 --> 41:11.120
and then it'll say.

41:11.120 --> 41:12.320
And I want to clarify, I'm sorry,

41:12.320 --> 41:14.040
but this is an important point of the trademark

41:14.040 --> 41:18.400
is that the content that you buy is required

41:18.400 --> 41:21.120
for a particular online game they attempt to launch.

41:21.120 --> 41:24.080
So Loki's Borderlands example, if, you know,

41:24.080 --> 41:26.720
your friend has this expansion that you're trying to play,

41:26.720 --> 41:28.440
then you could buy it at the touch of a button.

41:28.440 --> 41:31.000
Or I'm thinking the big one would be Rock Band.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.040
Like that would be huge because, you know,

41:33.040 --> 41:34.240
oh, we want to play this song.

41:34.240 --> 41:35.480
Oh, I don't have that song.

41:35.480 --> 41:37.280
Press X and you will buy the song

41:37.280 --> 41:39.700
with your imaginary money that's actually real money

41:39.700 --> 41:41.600
that got turned into imaginary money.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
And that's what you pay for with Microsoft system.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.200
Like it would be that easy.

41:46.200 --> 41:48.840
I'm imagining other things like Game Room

41:48.840 --> 41:51.100
would kind of tie into this too.

41:51.100 --> 41:52.200
I was trying to think of,

41:52.200 --> 41:53.160
I was trying to come up with this.

41:53.160 --> 41:54.600
I was trying to explain to Alan yesterday

41:54.600 --> 41:56.320
and I don't think my point really came across very well.

41:56.320 --> 41:59.520
I was like, I think Game Room is kind of like Rock Band.

41:59.520 --> 42:01.360
I think Game Room kind of has a lot in common

42:01.360 --> 42:02.520
with Rock Band.

42:02.520 --> 42:06.680
It's a system that's really gonna make their bucks

42:06.680 --> 42:09.720
off of all these microtransactions is, you know,

42:09.720 --> 42:11.640
where, you know, well, obviously they're not making

42:11.640 --> 42:13.280
any money off of the shell of the game.

42:13.280 --> 42:14.960
And it's kind of like, well, yeah,

42:14.960 --> 42:17.280
you pay $40 up front for Rock Band,

42:17.280 --> 42:18.760
but you get all these default songs.

42:18.760 --> 42:21.640
But for Game Room, you pay zero, you get nothing,

42:21.640 --> 42:23.360
but the whole thing's out of microtransactions.

42:23.360 --> 42:25.720
It's actually like, a better comparison would be

42:25.720 --> 42:28.920
that Game Room is more like that PSP demo

42:28.920 --> 42:30.120
for Rock Band Unplugged.

42:30.120 --> 42:30.960
You remember that?

42:30.960 --> 42:33.920
They came with like one song and all the rest

42:33.920 --> 42:36.320
would play just DLC is all it would play.

42:36.320 --> 42:37.160
Yeah.

42:37.160 --> 42:40.120
It's almost kind of like that, but for classic games.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.740
So anyhow, but that might be another one.

42:43.740 --> 42:45.520
Hey, you go visit your friend's Game Room

42:45.520 --> 42:48.560
and they wanna play you in a battle of, I don't know,

42:48.560 --> 42:50.520
what's a two player game, Contra or something.

42:50.520 --> 42:51.880
You know, even though you've already bought that

42:51.880 --> 42:53.320
on Xbox Live some time ago.

42:53.320 --> 42:56.800
Well, you could press X and you can buy Contra

42:56.800 --> 42:59.840
for 300 Microsoft points and go to town.

42:59.840 --> 43:01.240
So it's just making it easier to spend

43:01.240 --> 43:03.440
your imaginary money, essentially.

43:03.440 --> 43:07.840
So yeah, and you don't have to quit the lobby to do so.

43:07.840 --> 43:10.780
That's another important thing too, is that sometimes

43:10.780 --> 43:12.720
if you wanna buy an expansion, you have to back out

43:12.720 --> 43:14.440
of the lobby, go back to the menu, do this all,

43:14.440 --> 43:17.180
no, it would be a lot faster this way.

43:17.180 --> 43:19.760
So I don't know, is this dangerous?

43:19.760 --> 43:24.200
Is this something that maybe they shouldn't be implementing

43:24.200 --> 43:26.760
because it makes it almost too easy to download games?

43:26.760 --> 43:28.280
Or what?

43:28.280 --> 43:30.960
Or is this just a logical, yeah, this is more

43:30.960 --> 43:32.720
of a give me your money type of step?

43:32.720 --> 43:34.000
I think it's just, it makes sense.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.240
It makes it more streamlined.

43:35.240 --> 43:36.840
I mean, you don't have to do it,

43:37.700 --> 43:40.720
but I don't know, it makes it easier.

43:40.720 --> 43:42.720
I would worry that there's like 13 year olds

43:42.720 --> 43:44.020
that are gonna sit there and hit the button,

43:44.020 --> 43:46.160
but hopefully their parents know about parental controls

43:46.160 --> 43:47.960
and there's no credit cards on file.

43:47.960 --> 43:52.880
iTunes and Amazon already have one click purchasing

43:52.880 --> 43:56.040
where you can just, with one click, buy TV, whatever.

43:56.040 --> 43:59.440
So just to have that, for Xbox to have that

43:59.440 --> 44:01.860
in their marketplace, I mean, other online stores

44:01.860 --> 44:04.160
have already, are already doing this, so.

44:04.160 --> 44:05.000
That's a good point.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.560
You know, and iTunes, I remember some time ago,

44:07.560 --> 44:10.560
I used to have, it was before they made the big upgrade

44:10.560 --> 44:13.040
to the engine, what are they on right now, 7.0?

44:13.040 --> 44:15.460
I think it was right when they upgraded to 7.0.

44:15.460 --> 44:18.480
On my old iTunes, whenever I would click buy a song,

44:18.480 --> 44:20.240
it would go into a shopping cart.

44:20.240 --> 44:22.280
Well, they got rid of the shopping cart completely,

44:22.280 --> 44:24.200
which I think is kind of bullshit.

44:24.200 --> 44:26.360
And what you do now is if you click,

44:26.360 --> 44:27.960
you don't click on buy song,

44:27.960 --> 44:30.320
but you click on the little dropdown next to that

44:30.320 --> 44:32.320
and you click add to wishlist.

44:32.320 --> 44:35.500
And they say that the wishlist replaced the shopping cart.

44:35.500 --> 44:38.060
But I think the way they did that was really shady.

44:38.060 --> 44:40.180
Like, I hate the way that Apple handled that

44:40.180 --> 44:42.680
because I'm so used to being able to click the big button

44:42.680 --> 44:44.280
and it just goes to my shopping cart.

44:44.280 --> 44:46.620
And then, you know, when I, maybe once a week

44:46.620 --> 44:48.800
or once every other week, I would just buy the cart

44:48.800 --> 44:51.320
because what I would do, here's what I used to do a lot.

44:51.320 --> 44:55.500
I would play online games and I would listen to online radio

44:55.500 --> 44:57.060
while I played the games.

44:57.060 --> 44:58.920
And if there was a song I liked

44:58.920 --> 44:59.980
that they played on the radio,

44:59.980 --> 45:02.440
I would go into iTunes, search for the artist right there,

45:02.440 --> 45:03.640
add the song to my cart.

45:03.640 --> 45:05.700
And like at the end of the week, I'd download all the songs.

45:05.700 --> 45:07.040
I have a new CD for my car.

45:07.040 --> 45:08.440
Like it was an awesome system.

45:08.440 --> 45:09.840
But then when iTunes switched it up,

45:09.840 --> 45:13.080
so now it's just click and you buy right away,

45:13.080 --> 45:14.840
I thought that kind of was shady.

45:14.840 --> 45:16.720
Like, yeah, they have the wishlist,

45:16.720 --> 45:19.260
but come on, Apple fans.

45:19.260 --> 45:21.840
They made that harder to get to.

45:21.840 --> 45:24.500
They made it harder to have a queue.

45:24.500 --> 45:27.100
They made it easier to buy a game right away,

45:27.100 --> 45:29.680
which was kind of crappy in my opinion.

45:29.680 --> 45:30.880
But that's a good point, Alan,

45:30.880 --> 45:34.500
is that this system already really exists in other places.

45:34.500 --> 45:37.880
And there's no, even without Microsoft Bucks on iTunes,

45:37.880 --> 45:39.200
it's real money.

45:39.200 --> 45:40.600
Good point.

45:40.600 --> 45:41.440
All right.

45:41.440 --> 45:42.480
Well, let's move on with some more stories.

45:42.480 --> 45:43.400
Loki.

45:43.400 --> 45:44.240
Yeah.

45:44.240 --> 45:47.200
So one of the new updates that's gonna be coming soon

45:47.200 --> 45:50.880
is USB storage support for the Xbox 360.

45:50.880 --> 45:53.400
Finally, you're gonna be able to just use

45:53.400 --> 45:57.720
your stupid jump drives or whatever to save your games

45:57.720 --> 46:00.320
versus having to buy the really expensive memory cards,

46:00.320 --> 46:04.120
which the last I checked was the 512 megabyte card,

46:04.120 --> 46:06.280
half a gig, for 50 bucks.

46:06.280 --> 46:08.160
And I just bought one of those memory cards

46:08.160 --> 46:08.980
not that long ago,

46:08.980 --> 46:10.440
although I don't think I bought the half a gig one.

46:10.440 --> 46:12.200
Maybe I did, but it only cost me 20 bucks.

46:12.200 --> 46:13.640
Whatever I bought was 20 bucks,

46:13.640 --> 46:15.160
and it came with Geometry Wars,

46:15.160 --> 46:16.920
which I tried to give to Alan,

46:16.920 --> 46:19.400
but you couldn't take it off the memory card,

46:19.400 --> 46:20.360
which was stupid.

46:21.300 --> 46:22.280
That is dumb.

46:22.280 --> 46:27.280
But thankfully, you will be able to use your

46:28.740 --> 46:31.980
USB memory cards to go ahead and save your games.

46:31.980 --> 46:34.080
You can do download content, save games,

46:34.080 --> 46:38.500
games in demand, title updates, et cetera, indie games.

46:38.500 --> 46:41.660
And the thing is, though,

46:41.660 --> 46:45.840
you will only be able to use cards up to 16 gigabytes,

46:45.840 --> 46:50.840
meaning you can't just plug in say a USB hard drive

46:51.000 --> 46:51.840
or something like that.

46:51.840 --> 46:53.040
That's 120 gigs.

46:53.040 --> 46:56.080
Or those fucking terabyte drives now.

46:56.080 --> 46:57.440
You just bought one of those not that long ago, right?

46:57.440 --> 46:59.200
How much should I set you back?

46:59.200 --> 47:01.120
For the one terabyte USB drive?

47:01.120 --> 47:02.840
Yeah, about 110, 120, yeah.

47:02.840 --> 47:04.480
It's disgusting how much data

47:04.480 --> 47:06.080
you can take with you on the go now.

47:06.080 --> 47:07.600
So I mean, at the very least,

47:07.600 --> 47:12.600
you can store say, just without using a USB hub,

47:12.600 --> 47:16.040
you know, a good almost 60 gigs on there.

47:16.040 --> 47:18.880
I mean, now I'm assuming,

47:18.880 --> 47:21.760
I don't know if you can use like USB hubs on this,

47:21.760 --> 47:23.680
but maybe you could even plug in more drives

47:23.680 --> 47:25.240
if you really wanted to.

47:25.240 --> 47:30.240
But the way that whole thing works is really weird

47:30.580 --> 47:32.700
because I don't know if people know this,

47:32.700 --> 47:35.860
you could plug in your iPod into the 360

47:35.860 --> 47:37.400
and play songs off of it.

47:37.400 --> 47:40.180
And those drives are much larger than 16 gigs.

47:40.180 --> 47:42.560
It seems like if it's a media thing,

47:42.560 --> 47:44.720
you're only using it for like media files,

47:44.720 --> 47:46.800
that it doesn't care how large the storage is.

47:46.800 --> 47:48.520
Yeah, well you can play movies today.

47:48.520 --> 47:50.800
You can play a movie or a music file off a USB stick.

47:50.800 --> 47:51.660
Yeah, you can do that,

47:51.660 --> 47:54.320
but you can't store stuff from a 360.

47:54.320 --> 47:56.000
You can't transfer like saves or anything.

47:56.000 --> 47:56.840
Correct.

47:56.840 --> 47:59.260
And that's what this is basically gonna allow you to do.

47:59.260 --> 48:03.040
However, this also once again plays into what we saw

48:03.040 --> 48:07.840
with the supposedly slim 360 motherboard.

48:07.840 --> 48:09.300
There is no memory card slot.

48:09.300 --> 48:12.600
There's just the front USB port, the back USB port,

48:12.600 --> 48:14.040
and that's it.

48:14.040 --> 48:16.020
So it makes you think, okay,

48:16.020 --> 48:17.660
so they're just gonna use USB storage

48:17.660 --> 48:19.080
if you wanna do like a memory card.

48:19.080 --> 48:20.880
And I think that's a good idea

48:20.880 --> 48:23.400
because to be honest, the Microsoft storage

48:23.400 --> 48:25.680
is really, really overpriced

48:25.680 --> 48:28.400
and their hard drives are really overpriced.

48:28.400 --> 48:30.560
So I do hope that they allow users

48:30.560 --> 48:32.640
to use their own hard drives

48:32.640 --> 48:34.220
or have it come with a hard drive

48:34.220 --> 48:37.800
and just allow you to upgrade it later on

48:37.800 --> 48:39.560
if they're still gonna sell their crappy

48:39.560 --> 48:40.380
overpriced hard drives

48:40.380 --> 48:44.360
because I mean, hell, it's $200 now for like a 100

48:44.360 --> 48:47.920
or I think it's like $200 for a 120 gig hard drive

48:47.920 --> 48:50.960
or maybe not $200, but it's over $100

48:50.960 --> 48:52.880
for a 120 gig hard drive, which is retarded.

48:52.880 --> 48:55.160
But you could buy a one terabyte USB drive

48:55.160 --> 48:56.120
10 times the storage.

48:56.120 --> 48:58.360
Yeah, one terabyte, yeah, drive

48:58.360 --> 49:00.720
that has a USB connection on it.

49:00.720 --> 49:03.080
So it makes no sense that they would just,

49:04.020 --> 49:05.140
I mean, it makes sense for them

49:05.140 --> 49:06.360
because they're making a lot of money off of it

49:06.360 --> 49:07.880
because they're locking out everybody else.

49:07.880 --> 49:12.080
But I mean, really, there's cheaper solutions out there

49:12.080 --> 49:13.560
if you open it up.

49:13.560 --> 49:15.920
Well, I think, and I'm reading in our chat room

49:15.920 --> 49:18.680
at chat.orangewonstrated.com, YYR says the limit

49:18.680 --> 49:21.200
will be two drives according to reports.

49:21.200 --> 49:25.320
But even then, take two 16 gig drives, that's 32 gigs.

49:25.320 --> 49:27.380
That's still quite a bit.

49:27.380 --> 49:29.520
I mean, yeah, it's not as big as 120 gigabyte,

49:29.520 --> 49:32.400
but that's enough for most of you guys.

49:32.400 --> 49:34.640
Like if you don't do video on the 360

49:34.640 --> 49:37.140
and you don't install a lot of games,

49:37.140 --> 49:38.160
you're in good shape.

49:38.160 --> 49:40.480
And honestly, I don't know how much good it would do to,

49:40.480 --> 49:42.140
well, I take that back.

49:42.140 --> 49:43.200
Do you think it would do a lot of good

49:43.200 --> 49:44.880
to install a game to a USB stick

49:44.880 --> 49:46.740
as opposed to just doing it on a regular hard drive?

49:46.740 --> 49:49.200
I guess the difference would be unnoticeable.

49:50.040 --> 49:50.880
But I keep thinking.

49:50.880 --> 49:52.120
I would think maybe the USB drive

49:52.120 --> 49:53.260
might be a little bit faster.

49:53.260 --> 49:55.040
It's hard to say because the hard drives

49:55.040 --> 49:57.520
that are in there right now, they're just,

49:57.520 --> 49:59.440
I wanna say they're 5,400 RPM.

49:59.440 --> 50:03.580
They're really, I mean, they're standard

50:03.580 --> 50:05.240
for a laptop drive, but when you're talking

50:05.240 --> 50:08.160
about like desktop drives, they're 7,200.

50:08.160 --> 50:09.580
It's obviously a little slower.

50:09.580 --> 50:12.800
And it's also flash, so there's really no moving parts.

50:12.800 --> 50:15.680
So really, you'd be limited by the speed of USB 2.0,

50:15.680 --> 50:17.320
which would probably be, I would say,

50:17.320 --> 50:18.520
faster than that drive.

50:18.520 --> 50:20.240
The chat room is lighting up with some comments,

50:20.240 --> 50:21.540
and I wanna say some of these.

50:21.540 --> 50:23.800
The chat is reminding us that the 120 gig hard drive

50:23.800 --> 50:24.960
is no longer there.

50:24.960 --> 50:27.240
Spyro says the 60 gigabyte is left.

50:27.240 --> 50:29.000
That's it, nothing else.

50:29.000 --> 50:32.080
Bresloh wants to say, the reason the HDs are overpriced

50:32.080 --> 50:34.360
is because of the drive manufacturers found out

50:34.360 --> 50:35.680
what the hard drives were for,

50:35.680 --> 50:39.240
and they decided to screw a lot of money out of MS.

50:39.240 --> 50:40.080
True story.

50:44.040 --> 50:46.800
That's a dumb excuse, I'm sorry.

50:46.800 --> 50:47.640
Well.

50:47.640 --> 50:49.480
If they're gonna screw you out,

50:49.480 --> 50:52.160
screw you for those hard drives,

50:52.160 --> 50:55.060
just use different hard drives.

50:55.060 --> 50:57.480
All right, well speaking of dumb excuses,

50:57.480 --> 51:00.320
let's go to another completely different type of story here.

51:00.320 --> 51:03.280
This is a story that has to do with GameStop,

51:03.280 --> 51:05.680
and it also has to do with console shortages,

51:05.680 --> 51:07.600
and apparently GameStop has commented

51:07.600 --> 51:11.480
on the recent Wii shortages and PlayStation 3 shortages,

51:11.480 --> 51:13.700
and they are saying that those shortages

51:13.700 --> 51:16.440
do not look like they are coming to an end very soon.

51:17.400 --> 51:19.880
There's a quote here from Tony Bartell,

51:19.880 --> 51:22.320
who is the executive VP of merchandising for GameStop,

51:22.320 --> 51:25.040
saying, quote, they could sell a lot more hardware

51:25.040 --> 51:27.880
than what we have on both the PS3 and the Wii platform.

51:27.880 --> 51:30.520
They are saying it is not gonna end until early summer

51:30.520 --> 51:31.560
is when this is projected to end.

51:31.560 --> 51:32.400
And then by then,

51:32.400 --> 51:34.320
they're gonna have another console iteration,

51:34.320 --> 51:37.680
and it's just gonna be the same damn thing all over again.

51:37.680 --> 51:38.800
Just to clarify,

51:38.800 --> 51:42.520
they say the Wii is supposed to get the resupply first,

51:42.520 --> 51:45.200
and he thinks this is all because of the surge

51:45.200 --> 51:48.520
of the sales of the consoles from the last holiday season.

51:48.520 --> 51:50.460
I've heard a different theory, though,

51:50.460 --> 51:51.640
and that has to do with,

51:51.640 --> 51:53.360
and was it you who was telling me this, Alan?

51:53.360 --> 51:54.720
Somebody was telling me this

51:54.720 --> 51:57.040
about the whole fiscal year that plays into this.

51:57.040 --> 51:59.760
That was you on a previous show.

51:59.760 --> 52:00.600
The fiscal year,

52:00.600 --> 52:02.360
did you think the fiscal year's playing into this

52:02.360 --> 52:03.680
on both Nintendo and Sony?

52:03.680 --> 52:05.520
I don't know, they're just dicking around, though,

52:05.520 --> 52:07.080
right now is what I know,

52:07.080 --> 52:09.320
because first party anything from Sony

52:09.320 --> 52:11.700
is like damn hard to get right now.

52:12.960 --> 52:15.760
So who knows what the situation is,

52:15.760 --> 52:20.080
and unfortunately, they could be sending them to retailers,

52:20.080 --> 52:21.400
but apparently retailers are saying

52:21.400 --> 52:22.240
they're not getting them.

52:22.240 --> 52:23.840
I just have a hard time believing three months

52:23.840 --> 52:25.840
after the holiday season,

52:25.840 --> 52:27.920
and I mean, the holiday season was pretty good to them,

52:27.920 --> 52:29.440
but come on.

52:29.440 --> 52:31.160
I mean, it's not like,

52:32.200 --> 52:34.040
there's no way you're that short.

52:34.040 --> 52:37.080
You know, you would prepare for the holiday season

52:37.080 --> 52:41.200
by ramping up production prior to the holiday season.

52:43.000 --> 52:47.620
I just don't see why you would, you know, not.

52:47.620 --> 52:51.680
Well, and how many freaking like PS3s

52:51.680 --> 52:54.680
are being sold right now?

52:54.680 --> 52:56.240
I mean, it just doesn't seem like

52:56.240 --> 52:57.600
it's as in demand right now.

52:57.600 --> 53:00.240
Maybe for birthdays and stuff, but that's it.

53:00.240 --> 53:01.520
A lot of them might have to do with the fact

53:01.520 --> 53:02.840
that they're hard to find right now,

53:02.840 --> 53:07.040
but I'm sorry, I mean, how many years has it been now?

53:07.040 --> 53:08.800
Just because it's not on shelves now

53:08.800 --> 53:11.220
is not making a demand for, you know what I mean?

53:11.220 --> 53:13.400
People aren't like trying to find them

53:13.400 --> 53:15.640
like they were when it first came out.

53:16.520 --> 53:17.960
People are waiting, they're just like,

53:17.960 --> 53:20.640
oh well, I can't find it now, I'm just not gonna buy it,

53:20.640 --> 53:23.140
because I don't have the money, or you know,

53:23.140 --> 53:28.140
times are tough, they're trying to purposely hold them back

53:30.040 --> 53:32.320
to create this sort of demand for the console,

53:32.320 --> 53:33.400
that's pretty dumb.

53:33.400 --> 53:35.440
People are seeing right through it now.

53:35.440 --> 53:38.400
I, just while Loki's been talking here,

53:38.400 --> 53:40.480
I pulled up BestBuy.com just to see,

53:40.480 --> 53:42.040
because they'll let you do a store search

53:42.040 --> 53:43.460
to see what the inventory looks like.

53:43.460 --> 53:46.340
Just so you know, they have a couple packages available.

53:46.340 --> 53:51.340
There's a 299.99 Sony PlayStation 3, it's the slim,

53:51.340 --> 53:54.680
so it's like the slim by itself, it's the 120.

53:54.680 --> 53:57.360
It is sold out online, and if you go into it

53:57.360 --> 53:59.160
to do like a store search, it won't even let you.

53:59.160 --> 54:00.960
It says store pickup, not available.

54:00.960 --> 54:02.300
So that is gone.

54:02.300 --> 54:06.740
Now there's a 349.99 console, 250 gig.

54:06.740 --> 54:09.480
You can buy it online, but then there's this red thing

54:09.480 --> 54:11.600
that says not available for shipping.

54:11.600 --> 54:15.940
So I guess you could maybe only do the in-store pickup.

54:15.940 --> 54:18.680
Well I did a search around the local zip code here,

54:18.680 --> 54:22.000
and the six closest stores in the Sacramento area,

54:22.000 --> 54:23.600
Citrus Heights, Arden Fair, Folsom,

54:23.600 --> 54:26.920
Roseville, Natomas, Elk Grove, all out, unavailable.

54:26.920 --> 54:30.040
So the shortage is real, there's no disputing that.

54:30.040 --> 54:34.040
But it's weird why that this is happening.

54:34.040 --> 54:36.720
And like I said, the theory,

54:36.720 --> 54:40.120
and it could be just someone talking,

54:40.120 --> 54:45.000
but the theory is that they're holding them until April,

54:45.000 --> 54:46.480
when their new fiscal quarter starts,

54:46.480 --> 54:49.160
because maybe either they've hit their numbers

54:49.160 --> 54:52.000
that they want this year, no point in really trying

54:52.000 --> 54:54.160
to boost their numbers, but for next financial year,

54:54.160 --> 54:57.160
maybe they wanna really try to boost their numbers.

54:57.160 --> 54:58.000
I don't know.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.920
The thing that seems ridiculous to me right now

54:59.920 --> 55:03.200
is that two of the biggest PlayStation 3 games

55:03.200 --> 55:06.100
that could have been system sellers are out now.

55:06.100 --> 55:10.380
Final Fantasy 13, although granted, the whole 360 thing,

55:10.380 --> 55:13.480
you know, if gamers want it, and they have a 360 already,

55:13.480 --> 55:14.360
they can just buy it there,

55:14.360 --> 55:17.080
and I know there's been a lot of back and forth

55:17.080 --> 55:18.300
about which version is better,

55:18.300 --> 55:20.740
but there's no difference, you guys.

55:20.740 --> 55:23.080
The differences are minuscule, so just drop it.

55:23.080 --> 55:24.440
I'm wondering on the audio, though,

55:24.440 --> 55:27.320
a question just to go on the Final Fantasy real quick,

55:27.320 --> 55:28.240
and this is totally random,

55:28.240 --> 55:30.320
but how's your audio sounding on that?

55:30.320 --> 55:34.740
Do their voices sound kind of metallic, I guess, to you?

55:34.740 --> 55:35.580
I mean, I know-

55:35.580 --> 55:37.680
No, but that could be your sound setup.

55:37.680 --> 55:38.520
You don't necessarily-

55:38.520 --> 55:40.020
But I have surround sound headphones,

55:40.020 --> 55:42.440
and I've done everything to try to configure it

55:42.440 --> 55:43.840
so that the sound sounds okay,

55:43.840 --> 55:45.860
but it still sounds kind of metallic.

55:45.860 --> 55:46.700
Seems okay to me.

55:46.700 --> 55:48.880
Like it's heavily buffered or something.

55:50.380 --> 55:51.740
Well, also, I do want to say, though,

55:51.740 --> 55:53.860
the other big game that's out,

55:53.860 --> 55:56.280
God of War 3 came out this week, hello?

55:56.280 --> 55:57.600
That is a system seller.

55:57.600 --> 55:59.240
That is one that people will run out

55:59.240 --> 56:01.820
and buy PlayStation 3s for, but they can't,

56:01.820 --> 56:04.440
and there's no God of War 3 bundle or nothing,

56:04.440 --> 56:06.400
and that really surprises me.

56:06.400 --> 56:10.940
That seems just not smart to have your big game out

56:10.940 --> 56:12.360
and not have the systems to back it up,

56:12.360 --> 56:13.760
especially if it's intentional.

56:13.760 --> 56:17.120
If it really, truly is an unintentional shortage,

56:17.120 --> 56:19.120
then okay, whatever, just bad luck.

56:19.120 --> 56:22.440
But if it's an intentional shortage, that was dumb.

56:22.440 --> 56:24.880
Then they should've delayed God of War 3,

56:24.880 --> 56:27.760
saying, you know, quality issues or whatever.

56:27.760 --> 56:29.480
They would've lied and said it was a quality thing

56:29.480 --> 56:30.720
or something.

56:30.720 --> 56:33.640
It's what they have coming out from first party for Sony

56:33.640 --> 56:34.940
in the next couple months.

56:34.940 --> 56:35.780
Not much.

56:35.780 --> 56:39.140
I mean, they have ModNation Racers, but that's in May.

56:39.140 --> 56:44.140
And then after that, well, that's it.

56:44.180 --> 56:46.260
So, ModNation Racers, which I don't think-

56:46.260 --> 56:48.060
Well, and then the move is-

56:48.060 --> 56:50.180
But that's not until the holiday, I mean.

56:51.700 --> 56:52.540
I don't know.

56:53.740 --> 56:56.020
All right, well, Loki, you have a little more,

56:56.020 --> 56:57.440
speaking of GameStop, right?

56:57.440 --> 57:00.020
Yes, they're still evaluating

57:00.020 --> 57:03.340
the Customer Loyalty Opportunity Program.

57:03.340 --> 57:05.920
Apparently, you may remember there was a survey

57:05.920 --> 57:07.900
that went out a while back saying that,

57:07.900 --> 57:10.560
you know, they're gonna have different tiered programs

57:10.560 --> 57:12.840
where you can maybe buy into it or whatever

57:12.840 --> 57:16.520
and you get certain discounts, perks, et cetera.

57:16.520 --> 57:20.440
Apparently, you know, GameStops, you know,

57:20.440 --> 57:22.040
they've commented that we're in the process

57:22.040 --> 57:25.040
of evaluating loyalty opportunities for our customers.

57:25.040 --> 57:26.880
As this is a work in progress,

57:26.880 --> 57:29.080
we're not gonna comment on any speculation

57:29.080 --> 57:31.740
to changes to our edge card program.

57:31.740 --> 57:34.760
And then they continue to go and comment on

57:34.760 --> 57:37.340
changes that are gonna happen to the edge card program.

57:37.340 --> 57:40.340
They're gonna be testing in foreign markets.

57:40.340 --> 57:45.340
Apparently, there's a French gaming chain named Micromania

57:47.240 --> 57:49.400
during the GameStop conference call.

57:49.400 --> 57:51.000
And I'm wondering if Micromania

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
may be owned by GameStop now.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.880
They may have, yeah, they were bought out.

57:55.880 --> 57:59.240
It says, we believe that the loyalty program at Micromania

57:59.240 --> 58:02.320
drove some of the highest sales per store

58:02.320 --> 58:03.900
in Europe that we've seen.

58:03.900 --> 58:05.720
So we think it's a very effective program

58:05.720 --> 58:08.180
and that's the base for what we added

58:08.180 --> 58:11.440
to our existing loyalty program here at the edge.

58:12.280 --> 58:17.040
So let's see, some of these different perks

58:17.040 --> 58:18.900
they're gonna have here, they're saying,

58:18.900 --> 58:22.680
so Micromania had the MegaCart program for many, many years.

58:22.680 --> 58:23.920
It's probably the most successful

58:23.920 --> 58:25.960
video game loyalty program in existence.

58:25.960 --> 58:28.840
If you look at Micromania, as we did early on,

58:28.840 --> 58:30.900
you know, 86% of their transactions

58:30.900 --> 58:33.920
have a MicroCart ID associated with them.

58:33.920 --> 58:37.440
MicroCart is not only a loyalty program,

58:37.440 --> 58:40.080
it becomes a launch device in a vehicle.

58:40.080 --> 58:41.940
It becomes a marketing vehicle.

58:41.940 --> 58:44.760
It even helps you decide where to put a new store

58:44.760 --> 58:48.040
as a real estate vehicle.

58:48.040 --> 58:51.560
We believe that the loyalty program at Micromania

58:51.560 --> 58:53.680
drove some of the highest sales per store in Europe

58:53.680 --> 58:54.800
that we've ever seen.

58:54.800 --> 58:56.320
So we think it's a very effective program

58:56.320 --> 58:57.680
and that's the base, of course,

58:57.680 --> 58:59.800
what they're gonna use for the edge program.

58:59.800 --> 59:01.220
How theirs will be different,

59:01.220 --> 59:04.100
our program will be heavily built on heavily

59:04.100 --> 59:05.320
what you see at Micromania today,

59:05.320 --> 59:07.760
but it will add some very significant pieces.

59:07.760 --> 59:10.880
Our marketing team has done some extensive surveys,

59:10.880 --> 59:15.880
like we saw linked online, let's see here,

59:16.280 --> 59:19.120
of kinds of rewards that customers are looking for.

59:19.120 --> 59:20.920
If you recall one of the previous,

59:20.920 --> 59:23.440
or one of our conferences,

59:23.440 --> 59:26.780
the fact that we did an internet survey,

59:26.780 --> 59:28.400
had to shut down the response engine

59:28.400 --> 59:31.400
because it was so much, or there was so much interest

59:31.400 --> 59:33.760
in the GameStop loyalty program.

59:33.760 --> 59:35.160
Ours will have different rewards.

59:35.160 --> 59:39.300
It won't be purely a markdown program

59:39.300 --> 59:42.200
that gives discounts once you reach a certain threshold.

59:42.200 --> 59:45.480
It will also have unique rewards like tickets to shows

59:45.480 --> 59:49.060
and early entrances to midnight launch, et cetera.

59:49.060 --> 59:51.680
So we think that builds on what they have

59:51.680 --> 59:52.720
for Micromania now.

59:52.720 --> 59:56.680
So the four markets, they didn't really say

59:56.680 --> 59:57.760
where they're gonna start it,

59:57.760 --> 01:00:02.680
but I would imagine it's gonna be some pretty random markets

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:03.520
that they're gonna put them in

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:06.200
because usually it's not their top markets, so.

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.120
I feel like when you're reading a story like this

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:09.680
about GameStop and their programs,

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:11.800
I should be playing like a song like this.

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:16.640
We can try that.

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.740
Could you try reading the press release again?

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:20.360
Yes.

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:23.360
So we think that it builds on what we have for Micromania,

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:26.520
but it really adds lots of sophistication,

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:31.480
and consumer insights to monetize that GameStop consumer

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:33.280
and brings unique rewards

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:34.960
that only GameStop can bring you.

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.660
Resistance is futile.

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:41.940
Join us in our rewards program.

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:49.160
Oh yeah.

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:50.440
All right, seriously though.

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:52.920
I mean, is there enough here to really get that customer?

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:55.120
Well, they were as if they needed to stomp out

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:56.280
more of their competitors.

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:58.720
They're completely vague in that, though,

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.640
so that's the thing is unless I see a sheet

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:02.160
that says what I'm getting exactly

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:04.840
and what I have to pay into it to get,

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:06.120
you know, I'm not exactly sure

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:08.960
if it's something that I really wanna participate in.

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:11.200
But hey, if it's like the end of the GameStop cards now

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:15.040
where I pay $15 a year and I get discounts and whatnot,

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.480
I mean, that's kinda cool, I guess.

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:17.600
And I get a magazine at least.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:19.400
I can thumb through it once a month.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.740
Frisbee in our chat room says,

01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:26.520
I am your retailer, get it?

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:29.800
All right, well, speaking of GameStop

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:31.840
or whatever store you wanna do,

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:34.760
there are some pre-order bonuses for ModNation Racers.

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:36.600
As mentioned before, ModNation Racers

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.680
is making its way out to stores in May,

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:41.560
and the date is May 25th, but,

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:43.400
and this has been done with quite a few Sony games,

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:45.520
if I'm not mistaken, and probably some 360 ones too

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:46.400
I can't think of right now,

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:48.840
but depending on where you pre-order it

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:50.480
is the bonus you're gonna get.

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:53.840
And the bonus has to do with the extra kart racers.

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.360
Now, if you decide to order from GameStop

01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:58.280
you will get Kratos from God of War,

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:01.760
which I'm sure is gonna be a very popular one.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.560
But you can also pre-order from Amazon

01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:05.960
and you can get either Ratchet or Clank.

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:06.920
I don't know how that works,

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:09.600
if you pick when you use the code or what happens,

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:10.440
but you get Ratchet or Clank.

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:11.840
Maybe you get both.

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:13.360
Maybe you do get both, I don't know.

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:16.360
And then Best Buy, you get Nathan Drake from Uncharted,

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:17.480
which is actually pretty cool.

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:19.520
He looks like a me, honestly.

01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:21.080
It looks like one of the Wii characters.

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:23.300
When you look at the little picture of Nathan Drake,

01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:25.240
honestly, it looks like a little me there,

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:26.920
but that's what it is.

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:28.780
Kind of the cool, in my opinion,

01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:31.360
I do love God of War, don't get me wrong,

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:33.200
but I think the Uncharted guy's the coolest.

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:34.680
I think I would get it from Best Buy

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:36.580
just to get Nathan Drake, so.

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.800
Now, I'm sure at some point

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:41.760
they're all gonna be microtransactions

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.160
on the Sony marketplace anyway,

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:45.580
but if you wanna cut that corner

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:47.220
you can do the pre-order there.

01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:52.220
By the way, also, you do get some type of mystery mod package

01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:54.100
when you pre-order the game.

01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:57.600
You get pictures, and you get other accessories

01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:00.480
to outfit your racer, and yep,

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:03.700
you don't know exactly what stuff you're getting

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:04.860
until you input the code.

01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:07.740
It's kind of one of those mystery pins at Disneyland,

01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:09.140
but that's what it is.

01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:11.420
So, could be interesting.

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:15.060
Any interest in ModNation Racers?

01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:17.080
You gonna run out and get this game, day one?

01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:19.060
I'm not sure, I have it on order,

01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:21.420
but I'm not sure if I'm gonna pick it up right away.

01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:23.300
It looks neat, but I just have a feeling

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:26.380
it's not gonna be as good as Little Big Planet.

01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:28.540
And that's really, they're trying to get us to think

01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:30.400
that it's gonna be Little Big Planet,

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:31.900
you know, the kart racing game.

01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:36.380
No, that's not what it's gonna be,

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:38.140
but it'll be pretty cool.

01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:40.660
I have to admit, I'm kind of curious about the game

01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:42.500
because I do really like the kart racing games.

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:45.460
Like, I really like, of course, you know, Mario Kart,

01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:47.580
and I like, you know, those types of games.

01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:49.700
But yeah, I didn't get into the beta.

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:51.040
I wish I would have just played the beta

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:52.380
to see if it was good or not.

01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:55.380
I unfortunately got into the beta, but I never played it.

01:03:55.380 --> 01:03:57.540
Which I can't believe I forgot to mention

01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:58.380
during my gaming week,

01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:00.540
because we were too busy talking about bad games.

01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:02.940
But one game I did play this week was the blur beta.

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:04.720
Finally decided to give that a try

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:06.420
and give that a go, the blur beta.

01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:08.720
And I had a lot of problems connecting to a race.

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:09.800
So when I was playing it the first time,

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.880
I could not get into a race.

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:13.700
But I went in, I just waited a couple hours

01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:15.120
and went in later and it worked just fine.

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:17.560
And we actually played a couple races, just Alan watched.

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:18.580
And it was really pretty.

01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:19.420
It was nice looking.

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:20.260
I thought it looked amazing.

01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:21.620
Yeah, the graphics are really good.

01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:23.740
And you know, I had a lot of fun

01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:25.940
because, you know, this one random guy

01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:27.360
and I kept targeting each other.

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:29.780
Like, we kept randomly passing each other and stuff.

01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:30.620
So I had fun with blur.

01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:31.900
I definitely want to pick up that full game

01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:32.740
when it comes out.

01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:34.580
Yeah, they leaked out the beta for that.

01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:35.420
What's that?

01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:37.280
So the beta got leaked out for that.

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:38.320
How's that work?

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:40.900
It's like a demo on a Xbox slot,

01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:43.600
or not Xbox Live, like a Xbox marketplace.

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:45.760
Basically, you just copy it to your hard drive and run it.

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:46.340
Really?

01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:46.840
Yeah.

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:47.740
They did the same thing in Halo.

01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:49.540
Do you have to have a modded Xbox to do that, though?

01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:50.240
I don't think so.

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.260
Really?

01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:52.140
Interesting.

01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:53.540
Well, I have some codes.

01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:55.420
Maybe I'll give those away later in the show.

01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:56.260
I don't know.

01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:58.900
Do any chatters want a blur beta code?

01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:00.460
I'll give some away later, if so.

01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:01.260
We'll do that.

01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:01.740
Why not?

01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:08.180
SSJ100Matt says, the soundboard works great in blur.

01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:10.540
Because, you know, he has the soundboard with the Duke Nukem

01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:11.460
stuff and everything.

01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:12.460
I don't know how he's doing it.

01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:15.140
He's patching it through the 360 voice thing somehow.

01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:18.380
And yeah, he can play all these random things he's playing.

01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:20.260
So if anyone in chat wants a blur beta code,

01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:21.260
I'll give some away later.

01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:22.920
Maybe I'll give them away during Listless.

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:24.420
Because they sent me three others.

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:26.660
And I know at least, I know Alan's going to want one.

01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:28.080
But I can give the other two away.

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:29.620
So I'll give those away to listeners.

01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:30.980
Why not?

01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:33.940
Oh, and the chat room's saying, please, sure, yay.

01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:36.580
OK, I will give them away to random voters

01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:38.280
in our Listless event later tonight.

01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:39.460
So stay tuned.

01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:40.260
Stay tuned.

01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:44.420
OK, meanwhile, let's get into some, what, release dates?

01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:45.700
Are we ready for release dates?

01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:47.080
All right, let's do release dates.

01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:49.580
All right, this week, there's some decent stuff coming out.

01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:51.980
But let's start with some stuff that's not quite

01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:53.240
what you may be looking for.

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:56.500
But hey, you've got people that you know that are kids

01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:57.820
and stuff, right?

01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:00.120
Zuzu Pets, yes, the crazy thing that they

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:03.940
were selling during the holiday that went like crazy.

01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:09.780
Little hamsters now coming from Activision to the Nintendo DS.

01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:12.540
In fact, you can actually snag one with a little baby hamster

01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:14.980
that's blue and yellow.

01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:17.420
That's one sick hamster.

01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:19.500
How to Train Your Dragon coming out,

01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:20.900
tying in with the new movie.

01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:24.780
And that's going to be on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii,

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:27.380
DS, and I believe, PSP.

01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:32.140
Bakugan Battle Trainer, the sequel to the marble battling

01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:34.180
game.

01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:35.820
That's going to be coming out to DS.

01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:38.900
MotoGP 0910.

01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:40.340
I guess they're kind of combining years,

01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:42.300
because they didn't have one come out last year.

01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:45.940
That'll be coming out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:49.740
Just Cause 2 coming out on PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360

01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:50.540
this week.

01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:52.700
Looks like a pretty fun game.

01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:56.780
Red Steel 2, guaranteed to be better than the first one.

01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:59.580
Coming out on the Wii, does require Wii Motion Plus.

01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:02.500
So you can also pick up the Wii Motion Plus bundle

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:04.180
for an extra $10.

01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:09.380
And saves you $9 off the cost of Wii Motion Plus,

01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:11.060
if you don't have it.

01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:15.980
My Pet Chimp coming out to Nintendo DS from 505 Games.

01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:19.180
505 Games, I may add, was also the company

01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:21.060
that put out that really crappy baby game

01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:23.860
that I put on my Twitter.

01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:26.300
They may be a good candidate to hit up for the president cat.

01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:27.740
Yes, I retweeted that.

01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:30.180
What the hell was that?

01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:32.880
It's an actual baby doll thing or something, right?

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:34.420
That's the special edition, yes.

01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:38.260
You can buy it with a, it's basically a,

01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:40.740
it comes with a holster for your Wii

01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:42.420
that you attach to any baby doll.

01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:43.620
But this one does come with a baby doll.

01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:45.000
It looks like an umbilical cord.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.480
And you play these little mini games,

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:50.620
like feeding the baby and whatnot.

01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:52.460
It's just funny though, because the baby doll

01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:54.860
that comes with the little special edition

01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:56.260
has a lazy eye.

01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:59.060
So it looks funny.

01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:00.420
Anyways, imagine Jim is.

01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:02.060
What happens if you shake the baby?

01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:04.020
Not that you should do that, that's not funny.

01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:04.860
But what if I want to?

01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:06.300
I don't know.

01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:07.840
There's, I don't know if you read that,

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:09.180
like the actual page or whatever,

01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:11.940
but he was tasked with putting powder on the baby

01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:15.040
and they told him to stop, but he kept doing it anyways,

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:16.300
covering the baby in powder.

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:17.140
That's funny.

01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:18.140
I think if you tried to play WarioWare

01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:20.820
with the baby peripheral, that might be a lot of fun.

01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:23.060
No, what you need to do though,

01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:25.680
is you use the baby peripheral with other games.

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:26.520
Like, you know.

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:27.340
Yeah, that's what he's saying.

01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:29.540
Play WarioWare with the baby peripheral.

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:31.620
Aim the A button.

01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:34.180
I feel like Wii Sports, like baseball

01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:35.760
or something like that.

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:37.020
You're bad.

01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:38.900
That would be awesome.

01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:39.900
Now there's a YouTube.

01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:41.220
Now we need to find the baby game

01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:43.420
just to do that for YouTube.

01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:44.860
And G. Ditz in our chat room

01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:46.820
makes the mandatory South Park reference.

01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:49.820
South Park reference, sorry, I'm eating too.

01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:51.080
Kick the baby, boop.

01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:55.500
Cabela's Monster Bunk, or Monster Bunk?

01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:57.120
Yes, it's a giant bunk bed.

01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:59.620
No, Monster Buck Hunter,

01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:01.520
because it's a deer hunting game,

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:02.780
comes with a gun.

01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:05.380
Oh yeah, perfect for the redneck, can ya?

01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:08.940
Rooms, the first building,

01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:13.680
coming out from Konami on the Wii and DS.

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:16.060
Shimagami Tensei, Strange Journey,

01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:18.460
coming out on DS as well.

01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:22.860
Disney's Stitch Jam, kind of a music platformer game,

01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:24.760
coming out also on the DS.

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:28.160
Settler 7, Paths to a Kingdom,

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:30.640
coming out on PC from Ubisoft.

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:33.060
Yes, with really crappy DRM.

01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:35.340
Hoop, or was it,

01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:38.300
Hall of Fame Ultimate Hoops Challenge.

01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:40.260
It's a generic basketball game

01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:43.060
trying to cash in on the NBA Jam franchise,

01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:45.340
and it looks like crap.

01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:46.180
That was quick,

01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:47.700
because NBA Jam was just announced

01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:48.900
a couple months ago, wasn't it?

01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:51.220
Well, this game's been around for a while.

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:53.100
They were just trying to put out a basketball game

01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:56.940
with Larry Bird in it, it's interesting.

01:09:56.940 --> 01:10:00.180
And let's see, this is an accessory though,

01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:03.740
but the Nyko Wand, they're gonna be doing the action pack.

01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:06.020
You remember the Nyko Wand's like the third party controller

01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:09.360
that actually, you can kind of move the buttons on it.

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:12.100
So you can plug it in with this gun attachment,

01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:14.260
it actually has a physical button for the trigger

01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:17.020
instead of a trigger that pushes the B button

01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:18.340
on the bottom of the gun.

01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:20.740
And then coming out a week from now,

01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:22.960
America's Test Kitchen, Let's Get Cooking,

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:23.960
coming from Nintendo.

01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:25.300
Let's be honest here, folks,

01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:27.140
this is really just them repackaging

01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:29.180
that stupid learn to cook game

01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:31.720
that they put out a couple years ago.

01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:34.980
It looks exactly the same, I don't know.

01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:36.940
And then the better game of the two,

01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:41.660
WarioWare DIY will be coming out on Sunday.

01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:44.420
And to go with those,

01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:48.520
the Nintendo DSi XL in Bronz and Burgundy.

01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:51.800
Perfect for your Pokemon adventures

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:53.620
and your little Pokeball walking trainer.

01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:59.380
They should really just call it Bronz and Ron Burgundy.

01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:00.980
Oh boy.

01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:03.480
Oh, how did I, oh wait, no never mind.

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:06.540
That comes out next week, or the week after next.

01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:07.940
All right, what, what does?

01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:10.100
Oh, free running, that's kind of neat.

01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:11.160
What is free running?

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:13.040
Like parkour, like Mirror's Edge.

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.220
Oh, okay, that's kind of cool.

01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:15.740
Except not as cool.

01:11:15.740 --> 01:11:18.440
All right, let me get into some Japanese release dates

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:19.620
and tell you what's coming overseas

01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:22.360
on the Xbox 360 on March 25th.

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:24.960
Chaos Head Love Choo Choo comes out.

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:25.980
Yes, that's the name of the game.

01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:27.660
I'm trying to figure out what the hell this is.

01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:29.960
It looks like a dating sim or something, I don't know.

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:31.880
Every time I just see these anime girls

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:34.460
and a bunch of text, I assume it's a dating sim.

01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:36.860
So that's what I'm gonna call this game.

01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:38.780
Another game coming out that does not look

01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:42.820
like a dating sim is Hokuto Musou comes out.

01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:46.940
And this is a punch and kick type of game.

01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:48.980
I don't know if they have this out in America.

01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:52.340
I'm trying to think if there's a localized version of it.

01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:53.700
I don't know, for some reason it looks very

01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:55.860
like Fist of the North Star-ish to me.

01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:57.540
It's something Warriors.

01:11:57.540 --> 01:11:58.380
It might, is it Dynasty?

01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:01.260
Well, wait a second, what's it, what is it?

01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:02.780
Oh, it's yeah, it's the Fist of the North Star

01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:04.260
Dynasty Warriors game.

01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:05.260
Oh, yeah.

01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:08.260
Gomi, I actually identified that, woo hoo.

01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:10.260
And let's see, what else is coming out

01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:15.260
on the PlayStation 3, the God of War trilogy,

01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:18.120
as well as God of War 3 makes its way out to Japan as well.

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:20.860
So they get their versions not that long after we did.

01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:23.940
And Hokuto Musou also comes out over there.

01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:28.620
They also get Pachipata 15, Super Umi Monogatari

01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:31.140
in Okinawa 2 comes out as well.

01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:32.060
Rawr, rawr.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.580
Comes out over there from Irem.

01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:37.260
And it's a gambling game.

01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:39.340
I guess it's some type of, I don't know if that's

01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:41.840
like pachinko games or what the hell else it is there.

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:43.860
So there's that.

01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:45.960
That is out on the PlayStation 3.

01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:49.300
And on the Nintendo Wii, Silent Hill Shattered Memories

01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:50.840
gets its release in Japan.

01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:53.460
So if you wanna run and open doors and stuff,

01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:54.960
that is coming out on the Nintendo Wii.

01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:58.100
It's also coming out on the PlayStation 2.

01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:01.680
The Nintendo DS gets a variety of different games this week,

01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:05.020
like some type of phonics game and a wrestling game,

01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:07.400
but nothing that really big that's worth talking about,

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:08.240
to be honest.

01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:12.740
But the Sony PSP gets Burst Error, Eve the First.

01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:14.540
And I don't know what that game is.

01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:18.420
So that looks like a little, I guess,

01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:20.380
oh, it's a sequel to a PC game

01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:22.080
from the mid-90s, Burst Error.

01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:23.380
That's what this is.

01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:25.980
And they've turned it into Chicks with Guns

01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:27.560
and Abnormally Large Boobies.

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:29.400
There you go, look at that screenshot right there.

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:31.240
Big, big boobies.

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:34.680
And also coming out on the Sony PSP,

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:37.600
Prinny 2, Tokuyugi Akasuki No Pants.

01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:42.040
That's right, No Pants is in the title.

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:43.820
Daisaku Ensi, and I'm pretty sure

01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:46.240
that's I Wanna Be the King Part 2.

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:47.580
Yes, it is.

01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:49.760
Prinny 2 comes out this week.

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:50.980
Very nice.

01:13:50.980 --> 01:13:53.340
Well, joining us in studio just in time,

01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:56.580
say hello to Dark Sakura, or you're muted.

01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:57.580
Now you can, now you can roar.

01:13:57.580 --> 01:13:59.540
What the heck you mute me for?

01:13:59.540 --> 01:14:01.460
Well, cause I didn't want the mic picking up sound

01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:02.300
when you weren't here.

01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:03.820
I didn't want Shermie to jump up on your chair

01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:05.860
and go, meow, roar.

01:14:05.860 --> 01:14:09.980
Shermie is too freaking fat to jump up.

01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:13.980
And by the way, I'm still burning from the horseradish.

01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:15.980
I attended my first Seder tonight.

01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:17.220
Oh, did you have fun?

01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:18.060
It was a lot of fun.

01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:19.220
It was all chicks.

01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:20.380
It was a woman's Seder.

01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:20.900
Oh, I see.

01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:22.540
So it was very estrogen-y.

01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:23.380
OK.

01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:25.140
Are you all in the same cycle now?

01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:26.760
I don't know, but the food was good.

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:27.900
There was chocolate.

01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:29.020
Well, of course, with a bunch of women,

01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:30.720
of course there's going to be good food.

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:32.180
Oh, it was fantastic.

01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:34.660
And I brought the Nada Shovets.

01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:35.180
All right.

01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:37.100
It was like, we didn't tell anyone to bring the wine.

01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:37.820
Bring the wine.

01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:38.420
OK.

01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:40.380
Do you want to do UK release dates, or?

01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:41.140
Yeah, I can.

01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:42.540
You want to do UK release dates?

01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:43.180
Because we're ready.

01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:43.860
We're ready for you.

01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:45.540
Look, I had everything up already.

01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:47.500
You got here just in time for your first story.

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:48.580
How do you like that?

01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:50.540
Because we didn't have you slated for anything earlier,

01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:52.580
but you got here just in time for your first story.

01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:55.100
Did you want to talk about your gaming week real quick?

01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:56.740
Gaming week?

01:14:56.740 --> 01:14:58.700
I just assumed Star Trek Online and Peggle.

01:14:58.700 --> 01:14:59.620
That's what I told the listeners.

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:02.140
Well, no, I didn't play Peggle at all, actually.

01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:03.740
I did play Star Trek Online, and I

01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:05.480
was about to start Final Fantasy II,

01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:09.740
except I think I got a phone call, because it's on my phone.

01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:10.660
Oh.

01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:11.580
I got it for iPhone.

01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:13.580
Damn those phone calls interrupting your game.

01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:14.860
I got it for iPhone.

01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:22.980
And then Dan was playing Gauntlet, like on the NES.

01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:23.900
No, on the Genesis.

01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:24.940
He was playing Genesis Gauntlet.

01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:25.440
Awesome.

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:26.860
You missed it earlier in the show.

01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:29.420
Alan and I played Double Dragon on the Xbox this week,

01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:31.300
and we think it's the most horrible arcade

01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:32.360
game in existence.

01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:34.900
And one of those games just kind of sucks.

01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:37.620
But Dan came in here and yelled at us,

01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:39.700
because he thinks Double Dragon's awesome.

01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:41.660
He would.

01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:44.500
All right, UK release dates, Dark Soccer, just in time.

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:45.340
What week is this?

01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:47.700
The 21st through the 27th, huh?

01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:53.340
OK, on the 24th, Game Room, Xbox 360.

01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:54.780
God, why do they keep changing the date?

01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:59.280
BlazBlue Calamity Trigger, Clash of the Titans, Echo Shift.

01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:00.620
That's actually a cool name.

01:16:00.620 --> 01:16:04.620
Infinite Space, Just Cause 2, Pokemon Heart

01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:07.940
Gold and Soul Silver, whatever.

01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:12.700
Well, you know, OK, how different

01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:13.820
can they do a Pokemon game?

01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:14.420
Please tell me.

01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:16.220
Because you have the walking trainer this time,

01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:17.100
but it's a Pokeball.

01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:18.040
I had one of those.

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:18.540
Yeah?

01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:20.900
I had one of those, and that's when that's all it was.

01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:23.700
And it was yellow, and it was in black and white.

01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:26.540
But this one has Pokemans in it as you walk.

01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:27.820
Mine had Pokemans in it.

01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:28.900
That's right.

01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:32.020
You grow your Mudkips by walking around the block.

01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:33.420
Mine had Pokeman in it.

01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:35.300
It had Pikachu.

01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:37.860
So, eh.

01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:38.700
Where am I?

01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:40.260
I would play the MMO, though.

01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:43.020
And there's a Racket Sports Party.

01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:45.180
I would play the Pokemon MMO, and I

01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:47.140
would play Pokemon Snap 2 if they ever made it.

01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:48.340
Would you play it in a box?

01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:49.380
Would you play it with a fox?

01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:52.060
I would play it on a train, and I would play it in the rain.

01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:54.420
Could you, would you, with a mouse?

01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:56.780
Shut the fuck up and read the dates.

01:16:56.780 --> 01:17:04.060
Resonance of Fate, Red Steel 2, Rugu Attack, Rugu Twisted

01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:09.340
Towers, Star Wars The Force Unleashed Ultimate Sith

01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:14.940
Edition, Die Seidler 7, Warriors Legends of Troy.

01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:17.340
God, they're just putting everything right together.

01:17:17.340 --> 01:17:18.700
I may as well do next week, too.

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:21.100
Shoot, Grand Theft Auto IV, or whatever.

01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:23.100
But again, or is that like a price reduction?

01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:24.020
It's a loss in the damn.

01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:24.700
I think it's a.

01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:25.820
Oh, gotcha.

01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:27.700
By the way, our chat room jumping out here

01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:29.420
and screaming some corrections here.

01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:30.540
Llama Juice, it's not new.

01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:31.820
It's gold and silver.

01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:34.580
And Llama Juice says, the game is actually fun.

01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:36.860
And Dr. Tetsuya says, you're Pokemans.

01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:37.900
Please show us them.

01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:40.340
Alpha Kinetagram says, gold kicked ass.

01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:41.100
Gold kicked ass.

01:17:41.100 --> 01:17:43.380
I thought Pearl was fun until I stopped going to the gym.

01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:46.500
Spike McRue says, yeah, but gold and silver were the best.

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:48.140
Let's be honest.

01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:48.900
No, no, no.

01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:50.360
I have some friends that are doing.

01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:52.260
The pinnacle is Pokemon Snap.

01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:54.780
There's this gal on my Twitter friends list,

01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:56.080
and I don't know her real well.

01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:59.140
I think she runs Gaming Angels, I want to say

01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:00.180
is the name of the site.

01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:01.700
I hope I got that right.

01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:03.900
And she made this tweet that I just found hilarious,

01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:05.700
because I kind of could see myself.

01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:09.420
She said something like, I'm in line right now waiting

01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:10.700
to get the new Pokemon game.

01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:11.860
Yeah, I'm 33 years old.

01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:12.360
What?

01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:16.560
And I'm like, oh, that must be awkward

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:20.460
to be in the midnight launch line for Pokemon.

01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:23.060
My Pokemans let you not show them to me.

01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:24.820
But I got to say, there's quite a few people

01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:26.660
I know that are playing the new Pokemon game.

01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:30.100
I almost, almost want to get it.

01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:32.340
But I'm afraid if I do, Alan will break up with me.

01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:33.380
He's like, no, I can't.

01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:36.020
If you do, I'll disown you, Rob.

01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:38.420
Alan, would you break up with me if I got the Pokemon game?

01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:38.820
Would you be able to handle it?

01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:40.160
I have nothing against Pokemon.

01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:40.900
Really?

01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:42.320
Do you want to play Pokemon together?

01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:45.160
We'll both get the game and then run around the block

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:46.020
and evolve our Pokemon.

01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:49.940
Rob, you're such a five-year-old girl.

01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:51.940
I'm just kidding, I'm not going to get it.

01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:53.180
Oh, but Spyro in chat.

01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:55.500
Oh, and Ionotropic I should give credit to first.

01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:58.020
A jump in and say, Pokemon pinball rules all.

01:18:58.020 --> 01:18:59.620
Abso-fucking-lutely.

01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:00.580
That was pretty fun.

01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:01.820
That was an amazing game.

01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:02.780
A++.

01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:03.780
I will sign off on that.

01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:05.860
It's still burning from the damn horseradish.

01:19:05.860 --> 01:19:07.780
It's also really kind of hot in the studio right now.

01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:09.220
Well, you know, I've got this thing

01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:10.940
that I used to tie the curtains back with, Rob,

01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:12.100
so you could actually have airflow.

01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:12.460
Hi.

01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:13.860
By the way, I was going to ask you when you got here.

01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:15.900
Were you able to do the orange scarf, after all?

01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:17.340
Or was that not finished?

01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:18.900
All right, that's all right.

01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:19.700
I've had no time.

01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:20.440
No, I understand.

01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:21.060
I understand.

01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:24.220
I just want to, before I talk about PAX East in part B,

01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:25.340
I want to make sure I have.

01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:27.260
But I'll try to get this monstrosity finished.

01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:29.980
Well, I leave on Tuesday night.

01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:31.740
So I'm good.

01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:32.420
Oh, all right.

01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:32.940
Oh, no.

01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:34.380
I don't think I can get it done.

01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:35.420
I'll ship it to you.

01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:36.420
All right.

01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:40.060
Anyhow, let's move on with some more crash, bang, boom.

01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:41.820
There's chaos going on in the studio.

01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:43.340
Let's get back to some gaming news.

01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:45.300
We have a couple more stories than the classic Game

01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:46.700
of the Week, Loki.

01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:51.460
Yeah, so with Game Room coming out very soon, actually,

01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:53.580
it's interesting to find out that there's actually

01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:56.660
going to be some achievements tied in with Game Room.

01:19:56.660 --> 01:19:58.160
I thought that they were just going

01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:02.700
to be tied in with actual games, but apparently it's Game Room.

01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:05.500
There's going to be 1,000 achievement points to be had

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:08.620
and 56 achievements altogether.

01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:13.380
Apparently, you get points every three medals that you earn.

01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:14.820
There's even some points, I guess,

01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:18.540
for spending time in the arcade, 36 hours total.

01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:23.020
So interesting that they have that.

01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:26.400
I don't know.

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:28.700
What do you think about achievements in Game Room?

01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:32.540
Well, it's cool that they are doing more than just the 200.

01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:34.180
I think a lot of people are bummed

01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:37.300
that they're not doing achievement points per game,

01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:38.980
but I think that would be a bit much.

01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:41.620
Like, to do so many achievement points per game,

01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:42.860
I think it would be too much.

01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:44.860
Especially with my whole rock band analogy,

01:20:44.860 --> 01:20:46.220
the game is Game Room.

01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:48.180
It's just the classic games are the songs.

01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:50.340
You know, they're the microtransactions.

01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:52.100
It does seem like, though, if you actually

01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:54.220
read through the list of achievements, most of them

01:20:54.220 --> 01:20:57.220
are driven by the medals that you win

01:20:57.220 --> 01:20:58.720
from playing the classic games.

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:00.220
So you're still going to have to have

01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:01.600
a variety of classic games in order

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:02.760
to get all the achievements.

01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:05.060
But I think it's pretty cool that they allowed

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:06.620
them to bump it up to 1,000.

01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:09.620
I mean, you're looking at a full game.

01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:11.500
Honestly, it's just kind of a different type

01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:13.180
of method of getting it out there.

01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:13.740
Definitely.

01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:15.360
And some of the achievements in there,

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:16.740
they have choose for themes.

01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:18.340
Like, place the theme in your arcade.

01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:22.340
They have one for placing five unique themes in your arcade.

01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:23.740
You know, theme your entire arcade

01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:27.340
with unique themes, your mascot, props, visitors.

01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:31.240
It seems like some of those are really easy achievements,

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:33.900
unless you have to do something to earn those decorations.

01:21:33.900 --> 01:21:35.540
Well, the decorations, the thing that

01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:38.620
worries me about the decorations is you have to buy those.

01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:40.780
Well, didn't they say that some you would get for buying

01:21:40.780 --> 01:21:44.500
game on release day baby but still it's

01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:48.820
buying something you know to me I do my

01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:53.280
buying achievement points hmm in a way

01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:56.340
you are if you don't buy any games for

01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:58.740
game room you can't get those metal

01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:00.460
based achievements all I take it back

01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:02.780
you could do it using the quarter method

01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:04.140
but you're going to have to spend money

01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:06.500
money one way or the other I'll check it

01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:11.500
out it'll be interesting to see I don't

01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:12.540
know how much I'm not really gonna play

01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:14.560
of it though I'm not gonna lie I'm super

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:16.040
excited about game room I'm all about

01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:18.260
the classic games but remember I do have

01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:20.460
a couple rules my number one rule is I

01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:22.420
will not buy a game that they've already

01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:24.560
released on Xbox live arcade so don't be

01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:26.460
looking for me and scramble or tempest

01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:28.460
because I already have those games I'm

01:22:28.460 --> 01:22:30.120
not buying them again and getting game

01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:32.220
room I don't care how pretty it is

01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:35.100
anyhow one more story for you guys

01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:37.020
before we get to the classic game of the

01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:38.340
week and this has to do with something I

01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:39.460
actually mentioned during the release

01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:41.060
dates a couple weeks ago actually I

01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:42.460
think it was last week on the

01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:44.420
PlayStation 3 this week they released in

01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:46.740
Japan something called torn well guess

01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:49.460
what apparently Famitsu is reporting

01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:51.700
that shops in Japan are selling out of

01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:53.420
this the standalone version of the torn

01:22:53.420 --> 01:22:56.740
DVR peripheral although I guess the

01:22:56.740 --> 01:22:58.500
PlayStation threes that have it built in

01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:00.020
there's still some of those available on

01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:01.460
shelves but this thing is selling like

01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:03.860
crazy now what is torn it's basically a

01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:06.980
DVR it's a DVR attachment imagine like

01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:08.580
they sold TiVo that you would attach to

01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:10.460
your PlayStation 3 that's what torn is

01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:12.980
it's a DVR attachment for your ps3 and

01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:15.440
apparently it's selling out just so you

01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:17.300
know don't bother importing it it will

01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:19.380
not work in America it's only capable of

01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:21.300
doing the Japanese terrestrial yes it's

01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:25.040
on the same system but the problem is is

01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:26.940
that I guess torn also downloads a lot

01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:28.540
of programming information and it's not

01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:29.620
going to do that for the American

01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:32.060
channels you know don't bother importing

01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:34.180
that but think about how cool it would

01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:35.420
be if they would just release that

01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:37.260
frickin thing over here imagine it

01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:39.300
imagine if they release TiVo for your

01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:41.020
PlayStation 3 would you buy it I would

01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:43.700
absolutely I don't have DVR on Comcast

01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:45.260
because I don't think the DVR that

01:23:45.260 --> 01:23:47.260
Comcast offers is that great to be to be

01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:49.060
honest I like how TiVo will do the

01:23:49.060 --> 01:23:50.500
recommended shows and all that stuff too

01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:55.100
and the the DVR on Comcast is kind of

01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:56.940
clunky for me I have something that does

01:23:56.940 --> 01:23:59.860
that it's called um the internet and

01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:02.100
downloading and watch it yeah I know I

01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:04.620
know and now you know I'm ready I'm

01:24:04.620 --> 01:24:06.020
actually ready to cancel our cable and

01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:07.180
get a different internet provider because

01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:08.860
I will dance on them to watch this TV

01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:10.260
but we hooked up a computer in the front

01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:14.780
room and watch Hulu I have a decent rate

01:24:14.780 --> 01:24:16.940
going on right now I have a special but

01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:18.860

01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:22.940

01:24:25.340 --> 01:24:26.580
minutes while I was getting ready for

01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:27.900

01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:30.700
TV we've watched at all we do nothing

01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:32.380

you can just find online and network

01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:46.180

or something no no untucked is like the

01:25:04.780 --> 01:25:06.500
behind the scenes at RuPaul's Drag Race

01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:09.940

01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:02.340
do a project runway video game on the

01:26:02.340 --> 01:26:04.860

Race video game on the way why not that

01:26:07.300 --> 01:26:09.820

buy a torn just so I can tape RuPaul's

01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:33.140
Drag Race that's basically what it boils

01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:35.340
down to okay let's get into another

01:26:35.340 --> 01:26:36.660
segment on our show we like to do this

01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:38.700
every week we take a trip down memory

01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:40.620
lane and visit the Thank You mystique by

01:26:40.620 --> 01:26:42.140
the way for popping in and get us

01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:46.740
talking about drag queens all right I

01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:49.380
would like to collect drag queens for

01:26:49.380 --> 01:26:53.540
myself gotta gotta gotta print them all

01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:56.940

like a drag queen all right but but but

01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:14.060
I think any Pokemon based off of mystique

01:27:14.060 --> 01:27:16.720
would be like a Porygon seizure and

01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:20.820

01:27:20.820 --> 01:27:23.460

01:27:33.340 --> 01:27:35.260
derailed with talk about drag queens but

01:27:35.260 --> 01:27:37.100

a large sword why thank you um this was

01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:04.860
a game actually in Japan is called

01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:07.460
berserk Millennium Falcon hen was so

01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:09.460
they've been on the show which is based

01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:11.980
on find a great tree in this village

01:28:11.980 --> 01:28:14.940
actually here no but I've seen a nice

01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:17.100
bush but you should hear the voice

01:28:17.100 --> 01:28:19.060
actor for gots you in this was Michael

01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:21.220
all these are more likely than we are

01:28:21.220 --> 01:28:24.780
Voltron strange so it's all the fault of

01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:26.580
these things huh the English dub which

01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:34.660
is stop it's a manager I love the

01:28:34.660 --> 01:28:36.540
American voice acting though because you

01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:37.820
know who they got to do Costco's voice

01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:40.420
was BJ Ward who was Princess Allura huh

01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:43.940
I was like these are voices I did I know

01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:45.580
from my youth so this game was like

01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:47.500
that's so cool and also my favorite

01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:49.300
Japanese voice actor was gots his voice

01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:50.700
in Japanese version is this like a

01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:53.780
Silent Hill kind of game no okay I let

01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:55.380
me let me get back to you all right

01:28:55.380 --> 01:28:59.540
please please berserk is a dark fantasy

01:28:59.540 --> 01:29:04.660
manga in Japan it's very graphic very

01:29:04.660 --> 01:29:11.380
graphic very violent it's cuts mistakes

01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:12.700
back here giving comments like look at

01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:14.700
the size of that sword it's a nice sword

01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:18.220
but the game is sort of an adventure RPG

01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:19.940
hack and slash type of thing it's really

01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:22.420
a big hack and slash it's see how much

01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:24.140
blood you can splatter and how angry you

01:29:24.140 --> 01:29:27.420
can make gots you so anyway it's based

01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:31.540
off of a manga and it's set for anyone

01:29:31.540 --> 01:29:33.900
who is a fan of berserk I've read a

01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:35.660
whole bunch of the manga it's set

01:29:35.660 --> 01:29:38.080
between volume 22 and 23 of the manga

01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:41.300
it's set after the anime series the

01:29:41.300 --> 01:29:45.220
anime is I think a 26 episode series and

01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:48.340
it did my the anime followed the first

01:29:48.340 --> 01:29:49.780
arc of the manga which was the whole

01:29:49.780 --> 01:29:52.780
Taka no Dan thing everybody in chat by

01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:54.020
the way is saying dark is an

01:29:54.020 --> 01:29:55.820
understatement dark is totally an

01:29:55.820 --> 01:30:01.020
understatement it's like it makes

01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:03.300
Tarantino movies look like Cartoon

01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:04.900
Network there's like this whole scene in

01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:06.460
the manga where they go into this cave

01:30:06.460 --> 01:30:08.900
and there is like an orgy of the

01:30:08.900 --> 01:30:11.940
thousands no a graphic orgy of the

01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:14.580
thousands cool blood orgy oh and then

01:30:14.580 --> 01:30:15.740
when they get to the place where they're

01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:17.220
doing the ink with the Inquisition and

01:30:17.220 --> 01:30:18.540
we're talking about old school torture

01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:21.260
devices pretty visit a Spanish

01:30:21.260 --> 01:30:24.980
Inquisition it makes a Spanish it makes

01:30:24.980 --> 01:30:26.300
the Spanish Inquisition look like a

01:30:26.300 --> 01:30:30.020
puppet show missy's back there good

01:30:30.020 --> 01:30:32.380
nobody expects a Spanish Inquisition

01:30:32.380 --> 01:30:35.360
what in the hell did where where did my

01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:37.660
show go has anyone seen it is it under

01:30:37.660 --> 01:30:39.340
the chair that's because misty walked

01:30:39.340 --> 01:30:41.660
into the room and she derails everything

01:30:41.660 --> 01:30:44.140
but this particular one was on the dream

01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:45.820
cast there's another one that came out

01:30:45.820 --> 01:30:47.700
on ps2 but I don't count it because

01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:49.980
really I like the Japanese one well the

01:30:49.980 --> 01:30:52.420
the dreamcast one I do have the Japanese

01:30:52.420 --> 01:30:54.820
version of this game and I got it just

01:30:54.820 --> 01:30:57.260
for the voice acting because they got

01:30:57.260 --> 01:31:00.660
the same people you know they got the

01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:03.540
same people from the anime like a high

01:31:03.540 --> 01:31:05.340
as she knows what she does got his voice

01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:07.340
and same everybody except of course all

01:31:07.340 --> 01:31:08.700
the ones who died violently at the end

01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:12.740
of the series everybody asked that yeah

01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:14.540
shall ran in our chat room says everyone

01:31:14.540 --> 01:31:16.340
dies the world ends and people burn in

01:31:16.340 --> 01:31:18.140
hell forever is a happy ending compared

01:31:18.140 --> 01:31:22.380
to desert yeah okay okay here's here I'm

01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:23.620
going to give the background and if you

01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:26.980
haven't seen the anime spoiler turn off

01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:29.060
your station for a little bit or fast

01:31:29.060 --> 01:31:31.740
forward or whatever the whole thing

01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:34.100
starts off with God says a boy and he

01:31:34.100 --> 01:31:35.860
goes off and joins a mercenary group and

01:31:35.860 --> 01:31:37.820
he meets this chick named Casca who is

01:31:37.820 --> 01:31:39.540
the second-in-command under this guy

01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:41.260
named Griffith who is totally pretty and

01:31:41.260 --> 01:31:44.220
has this weird egg that he wears it has

01:31:44.220 --> 01:31:46.460
two eyes and those in the mouth but all

01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:48.020
spread in different areas anyway stuff

01:31:48.020 --> 01:31:50.180
goes on Griffith turns out to be on the

01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:53.220
next in line to be well an evil God and

01:31:53.220 --> 01:31:57.060
sacrifices the entire group in this big

01:31:57.060 --> 01:32:02.460
bloody feast and yay blood feast and it's

01:32:02.460 --> 01:32:05.220
I'm not gonna go into it but as the

01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:07.100
manga starts continuing from there got

01:32:07.100 --> 01:32:09.340
some Casca have a mark on them that means

01:32:09.340 --> 01:32:10.380
they're followed by demons because they

01:32:10.380 --> 01:32:11.500
were tend to be part of the sacrifice

01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:13.620
but they escaped there are similarities

01:32:13.620 --> 01:32:15.300
between that and Final Fantasy 13 I just

01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:18.860
want to know no I know there's nothing

01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:22.140
nothing which is a bummer because I wish

01:32:22.140 --> 01:32:24.060
vanille was in the game Jamie's talking

01:32:24.060 --> 01:32:27.060
about that's that's the only bummer yes

01:32:27.060 --> 01:32:30.180
you can finish so anyway um so this is

01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:32.820
this is a side story but it from what I

01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:34.420
understand it is considered part of part

01:32:34.420 --> 01:32:40.020
of the cannon and so got to somewhere in

01:32:40.020 --> 01:32:42.620
the manga got this little elf starts

01:32:42.620 --> 01:32:43.860
following got to around called puck

01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:45.780
who's really more like a weird little

01:32:45.780 --> 01:32:48.780
chubby fairy with blue hair but anyway

01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:52.740
and what you call me a blue chubby fairy

01:32:52.740 --> 01:32:56.980
anyway anyway and the whole point is

01:32:56.980 --> 01:32:59.420
that Casca from her ordeal because she

01:32:59.420 --> 01:33:02.900
had a bad time has no memory she acts

01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:04.100
like a little child she giggles she

01:33:04.100 --> 01:33:06.300
doesn't talk she's just clueless about

01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:07.900
the world around her and so it got to

01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:09.300
trying to take her to the home of the

01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:10.460
elves to get her brain cured or

01:33:10.460 --> 01:33:13.820
something and so he hears about the

01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:16.820
Mandragora which for anyone who knows

01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:18.460
what what the legend of the Mandrake

01:33:18.460 --> 01:33:19.900
route is you know you pick it's like in

01:33:19.900 --> 01:33:21.060
Harry Potter Rob you pick him up the

01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:23.140
screen as a grown-up one will make your

01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:26.060
head explode or some shit anyway so

01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:29.220
sounds like fun so anyway it's you know

01:33:29.220 --> 01:33:30.860
them getting all caught up in this one

01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:33.780
thing because the main bad guy his wife

01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:35.540
has the same problem Casca does but it's

01:33:35.540 --> 01:33:38.020
long story I'm not getting onto it this

01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:39.820
is really a game worth playing really is

01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:42.740
a game worth playing it's really fun so

01:33:42.740 --> 01:33:46.700
of course it it it ends gruesome just

01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:48.380
like anything related to berserk ends

01:33:48.380 --> 01:33:54.260
and but it's just really really a fun

01:33:54.260 --> 01:34:01.140
game and like I said there was a another

01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:03.060
version that came out on PlayStation 2

01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:07.940
there's also the soundtrack now what's

01:34:07.940 --> 01:34:11.060
really cool about this is

01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:20.060
horses was the opening theme song to the

01:34:20.060 --> 01:34:21.860
anime and the guy who did the soundtrack

01:34:21.860 --> 01:34:23.980
for the anime and the opening theme and

01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:28.260
everything did did all the music in the

01:34:28.260 --> 01:34:30.620
game and he did a special version of the

01:34:30.620 --> 01:34:33.260
opening song

01:34:39.500 --> 01:34:41.740
she did a special version of the of the

01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:45.500
opening so it really this is actually I

01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:47.820
think one of the best tie-ins because

01:34:47.820 --> 01:34:49.580
you don't really have to me if you've

01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:50.540
been keeping up with the series you

01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:52.220
don't really have to guess about where

01:34:52.220 --> 01:35:05.740
it's gone where the specific

01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:09.780
this is actually one of my favorite

01:35:09.780 --> 01:35:19.140
pieces of music ever what what everybody

01:35:19.140 --> 01:35:20.540
from the living room keeps coming in

01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:22.260
here to derail the show Dan is just

01:35:22.260 --> 01:35:24.980
waving and tell everybody around tell

01:35:24.980 --> 01:35:27.060
everyone how awesome this game is he

01:35:27.060 --> 01:35:30.980
left he left yet chicken but head dessert

01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:37.700
chicken I'm disowning you Peter would

01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:39.220
tell you that what happens to chickens

01:35:39.220 --> 01:35:43.020
is something like this dessert game yeah

01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:47.140
but at any rate oh here you next time

01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:48.660
you have a chicken McNugget you always

01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:50.020
gets mad at me because I go to the

01:35:50.020 --> 01:35:56.660
startup by lunch meet what the fuck

01:35:56.660 --> 01:36:00.460
bitch you are eating that chicken or I'll

01:36:00.460 --> 01:36:07.780
give it to Eric Joker yes dessert hello

01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:10.340
we do a show here it's about on the one

01:36:10.340 --> 01:36:11.740
that was on Dreamcast yes dessert

01:36:11.740 --> 01:36:15.900
sucking was hard as nails it was like

01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:17.500
you get to know throughout his odd and

01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:19.980
he's like by the way I know you thought

01:36:19.980 --> 01:36:22.100
you were good at 3d action games but you

01:36:22.100 --> 01:36:24.740
saw and he'll kill you and kill you and

01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:26.860
kill you and kill you until you finally

01:36:26.860 --> 01:36:28.860
man up enough to beat them the rest of

01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:32.740
the game is fucking harder than hell yes

01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:35.900
and the story is a little bit dark no

01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:39.100
no berserk saw bright Mary it's very

01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:41.420
similar to the story of rape and

01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:45.340
insanity and that's just the back story

01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:47.060
they had called the game rape and

01:36:47.060 --> 01:36:48.820
insanity it would have sold more but

01:36:48.820 --> 01:36:50.340
berserk everybody thinks that's a game

01:36:50.340 --> 01:36:52.460
with a bouncing happy face no electric

01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:55.060
maze it's spelled differently that's

01:36:55.060 --> 01:36:57.180
spelled with a Z okay it has a lot of

01:36:57.180 --> 01:37:02.860
also hard as nails anything else chicken

01:37:02.860 --> 01:37:05.460
check it

01:37:06.460 --> 01:37:08.580
Dan was actually right that's pretty

01:37:08.580 --> 01:37:13.180
much how the series ends I have a laser

01:37:13.180 --> 01:37:16.340
disk now I like to berserk so that's

01:37:16.340 --> 01:37:20.220
very cool you have your mr. J anyway

01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:23.820
berserk was a series that I was so into

01:37:23.820 --> 01:37:30.660
I loved the anime piss off and give me

01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:32.780
I apologize to listeners there's just

01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:34.460
insanity going on in the studio tonight

01:37:34.460 --> 01:37:37.700
it's like it it's like our show has the

01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:39.180
red ring of death tonight because it's

01:37:39.180 --> 01:37:42.020
the 360 s episode so congratulations

01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:45.980
Dan you broke the show tonight five

01:37:45.980 --> 01:37:49.220
gamerscore all right yeah well I got

01:37:49.220 --> 01:37:52.340
your chicken right here

01:37:52.340 --> 01:37:55.700
there goes no it's in the fridge anyway

01:37:55.700 --> 01:37:58.980
yeah when Dan says that the back story

01:37:58.980 --> 01:38:01.540
for for this game is rape and insanity

01:38:01.540 --> 01:38:04.780
he means that literally seriously that's

01:38:04.780 --> 01:38:06.820
how did the TV series ends that's why

01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:11.540
Costco's fucked up so um it's it was a

01:38:11.540 --> 01:38:14.300
really you know what I have to say I was

01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:16.380
surprised that the game came over here

01:38:16.380 --> 01:38:18.820
because the anime hadn't been out over

01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:20.140
here they didn't turn the blood into

01:38:20.140 --> 01:38:22.100
sweat or anything no no it was vicious

01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:24.900
but they brought the game out over here

01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:26.900
and didn't really give any real back

01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:29.180
story to it it was before the anime you

01:38:29.180 --> 01:38:31.380
could only get it I think like in early

01:38:31.380 --> 01:38:34.980
fan subs and the manga was all not even

01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:36.020
that I don't even think there were many

01:38:36.020 --> 01:38:38.900
fan translations out at the time so it

01:38:38.900 --> 01:38:41.300
was just like berserk here you go and

01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:43.100
I'm like dude what the hell hey I like

01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:46.900
this and then I I watched some of the

01:38:46.900 --> 01:38:48.260
anime and said to get the Japanese

01:38:48.260 --> 01:38:50.060
version because I really love dudes voice

01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:52.540
Hayashi Nobutoshi is like my favorite

01:38:52.540 --> 01:38:53.980
voice actor ever if for anyone who

01:38:53.980 --> 01:38:55.820
watched Fushigi Yugi he did Tatsuki's

01:38:55.820 --> 01:38:59.820
voice acting and Bathora in Macross 7

01:38:59.820 --> 01:39:01.540
not the singing although he's got an

01:39:01.540 --> 01:39:05.060
amazing singing voice but that's those

01:39:05.060 --> 01:39:09.100
examples oh and he also was um who was

01:39:09.100 --> 01:39:10.300
the dude in Pokemon who had the earth

01:39:10.300 --> 01:39:14.700
based Brock yeah whatever his name was

01:39:14.700 --> 01:39:18.980

slash olr okay now we're ready for some

01:43:49.260 --> 01:43:51.260
news Loki let's do some rapid quick

01:43:51.260 --> 01:43:53.660
quick news yes so let's start off with

01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:56.980
the release date for crackdown 2 which

01:43:56.980 --> 01:43:59.180
is now being put into one of the most

01:43:59.180 --> 01:44:02.380
dead months of the year July yes it'll

01:44:02.380 --> 01:44:04.900
be coming out July 6 and boy does it

01:44:04.900 --> 01:44:07.780
look awesome the game will be releasing

01:44:07.780 --> 01:44:09.540
in North America on July 6 with Asia

01:44:09.540 --> 01:44:11.380
Australia and New Zealand following on

01:44:11.380 --> 01:44:14.300
July 8th in Europe following on July 9th

01:44:14.300 --> 01:44:16.940
no word on exactly when Japan will be

01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:18.940
receiving the game or any of the Asian

01:44:18.940 --> 01:44:22.340
regions but yeah it looks all sorts of

01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:25.780
awesome one thing that was supposed to

01:44:25.780 --> 01:44:27.620
not be coming out over here apparently

01:44:27.620 --> 01:44:29.940
is Batman Arkham Asylum the game of the

01:44:29.940 --> 01:44:31.380
year edition will indeed be coming out

01:44:31.380 --> 01:44:33.220
over in North America and will also

01:44:33.220 --> 01:44:37.460
feature 3d support as well originally

01:44:37.460 --> 01:44:41.380
they announced that the 3d would be done

01:44:41.380 --> 01:44:43.300
in a way that wouldn't alter the colors

01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:44.780
however I see now in the picture that

01:44:44.780 --> 01:44:47.340
they have the kind of purple and green

01:44:47.340 --> 01:44:50.020
glasses so apparently it's just going to

01:44:50.020 --> 01:44:52.700
be the standard 3d stuff but they'll be

01:44:52.700 --> 01:44:56.620
coming out in the early part of May and

01:44:56.620 --> 01:44:59.020
then finally to coincide with the

01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:01.220
Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker launch

01:45:01.220 --> 01:45:02.980
they're going to be doing a brand new

01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:06.100
PSP bundle it's going to be coming out

01:45:06.100 --> 01:45:09.820
on June 8th and it'll be a greenish PSP

01:45:09.820 --> 01:45:12.380
come with a copy of the game a two

01:45:12.380 --> 01:45:15.300
gigabyte memory sick pro duo and a

01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:18.460
voucher for some unidentified movie

01:45:18.460 --> 01:45:20.940
download as well as an exclusive in-game

01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:23.220
item for Peace Walker could it possibly

01:45:23.220 --> 01:45:25.220
be Metal Gear espionage related the

01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:28.260
movie just call it a hunch I don't know

01:45:28.260 --> 01:45:29.980
yes I don't know they don't have a

01:45:29.980 --> 01:45:31.820
Metal Gear movie well you know something

01:45:31.820 --> 01:45:33.300
there could be an anime or something

01:45:33.300 --> 01:45:34.340
right now I guess there isn't one is

01:45:34.340 --> 01:45:36.700
there I don't like James Bond it'll be

01:45:36.700 --> 01:45:38.340
quantum solace or something you know

01:45:38.340 --> 01:45:41.500
something close maybe um and that of

01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:45.180
course will be coming out for $200 um

01:45:45.180 --> 01:45:47.660
some news I have for you guys final

01:45:47.660 --> 01:45:50.540
fight double impact I hoping I'm really

01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:52.780
really hoping this is also not one of

01:45:52.780 --> 01:45:54.100
those games that I see through road

01:45:54.100 --> 01:45:55.740
color glasses like we were talking about

01:45:55.740 --> 01:45:57.500
earlier in the show but I don't know

01:45:57.500 --> 01:45:58.980
final fight came years after double

01:45:58.980 --> 01:46:00.780
dragons I don't know and besides it also

01:46:00.780 --> 01:46:03.140
has magic sword and I know magic sword

01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:04.980
is still all the Capcom like beat-em-up

01:46:04.980 --> 01:46:06.860
games are pretty awesome well it is

01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:09.140
coming April 14th and 15th depending on

01:46:09.140 --> 01:46:11.220
which story you want Xbox Live gets on

01:46:11.220 --> 01:46:12.820
the 14th and PlayStation Store gets at

01:46:12.820 --> 01:46:14.240
the same we just pointed at Captain

01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:16.740
commandos not part of that no but it's

01:46:16.740 --> 01:46:18.500
it's weird because it's final fight and

01:46:18.500 --> 01:46:20.060
magic sword like I can't think of more

01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:21.540
different games like yeah they're running

01:46:21.540 --> 01:46:22.820
on the same end I know but they're still

01:46:22.820 --> 01:46:24.620
like completely different games Loki

01:46:24.620 --> 01:46:26.140
they're not they have nothing in common

01:46:26.140 --> 01:46:28.260
yes the same engine that's all two games

01:46:28.260 --> 01:46:29.500
the present one that's the way I look at

01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:31.620
it that's fine that's fine so I'm

01:46:31.620 --> 01:46:32.620
looking forward to it if not for nothing

01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:35.500
else for me it's a magic sword featuring

01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:37.900
final fight because I I hate how magic

01:46:37.900 --> 01:46:39.340
sword is being understated in this

01:46:39.340 --> 01:46:41.260
release like that I don't know why it

01:46:41.260 --> 01:46:43.940
bugs me I'm just weird would you like to

01:46:43.940 --> 01:46:45.980
buy my namesake that's right you can buy

01:46:45.980 --> 01:46:48.940
an ROB robot the Rob the robot you can

01:46:48.940 --> 01:46:50.860
buy for the Nintendo Entertainment

01:46:50.860 --> 01:46:52.340
System except it will set you back only

01:46:52.340 --> 01:46:53.860
four thousand one hundred and fifty

01:46:53.860 --> 01:46:55.700
dollars that's right it just sold on an

01:46:55.700 --> 01:46:57.380
ebay auction this week but here's the

01:46:57.380 --> 01:46:59.340
deal guys it was like pristine in a case

01:46:59.340 --> 01:47:00.620
it looks like one of those sales cases

01:47:00.620 --> 01:47:02.300
that it was you have in the store I

01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:03.980
remember those yeah I remember those two

01:47:03.980 --> 01:47:05.460
so somebody actually bought that with

01:47:05.460 --> 01:47:06.840
the Nintendo system the controllers the

01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:09.500
gun all that stuff four thousand one

01:47:09.500 --> 01:47:10.700
hundred fifty dollars I don't know if

01:47:10.700 --> 01:47:13.020
they remembered but it wasn't that good

01:47:13.020 --> 01:47:14.420
like I don't know if you ever actually

01:47:14.420 --> 01:47:16.220
played the Rob the robot but it was kind

01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:17.840
of annoying wanted to get one for my

01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:19.820
desk and trust me they're a lot cheaper

01:47:19.820 --> 01:47:21.860
than four grand I mean you could get them

01:47:21.860 --> 01:47:23.840
well yeah but these are in pristine

01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:26.300
condition who cares and then the control

01:47:26.300 --> 01:47:27.620
I gotta say in the display box and

01:47:27.620 --> 01:47:29.220
everything's pretty cool but it's weird

01:47:29.220 --> 01:47:31.880
to think that that was sitting in some

01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:33.820
store that probably got sent it for free

01:47:33.820 --> 01:47:35.780
but yeah if you never played the Rob the

01:47:35.780 --> 01:47:37.460
robot before it was really weird it had

01:47:37.460 --> 01:47:39.440
these little gyro things that would spin

01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:41.580
and then you would have to move them on

01:47:41.580 --> 01:47:44.060
to a thing that would push down the

01:47:44.060 --> 01:47:46.020
button on your controller but then they

01:47:46.020 --> 01:47:47.500
would start to lose speed so you have to

01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:48.820
pick them up and rev them up again like

01:47:48.820 --> 01:47:51.460
it was kind of annoying yeah um the nest

01:47:51.460 --> 01:47:53.960
that I got was I think I got a nest when

01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:55.180
I was little within the first month of

01:47:55.180 --> 01:47:58.260
it coming out so I got the Rob system it

01:47:58.260 --> 01:48:00.100
really wasn't fun at all and it was loud

01:48:00.100 --> 01:48:03.100
it was so loud the sound of it you know

01:48:03.100 --> 01:48:05.080
spinning up the things my friend had one

01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:06.260
of these and I remember we tried to play

01:48:06.260 --> 01:48:07.700
it once it was a little ridiculous yeah

01:48:07.700 --> 01:48:12.300
yeah so not worth forty one fifty okay

01:48:12.300 --> 01:48:14.380
all right and one other story for you

01:48:14.380 --> 01:48:16.540
guys pac-man battle royale we talked

01:48:16.540 --> 01:48:17.780
about a couple weeks on the show saying

01:48:17.780 --> 01:48:19.140
it had the worst teaser trailer ever

01:48:19.140 --> 01:48:20.460
because it didn't say anything about the

01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:22.780
game now we finally know some things

01:48:22.780 --> 01:48:24.900
about the game a video has it hit the

01:48:24.900 --> 01:48:26.660
internet from the amusement expo that

01:48:26.660 --> 01:48:29.260
finally shows a little bit about what we

01:48:29.260 --> 01:48:30.880
can see in this game and we see some

01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:32.460
folks playing the game in this video and

01:48:32.460 --> 01:48:34.900
basically it looks like a little bit of

01:48:34.900 --> 01:48:37.020
a mixture between pac-man championship

01:48:37.020 --> 01:48:38.220
edition it kind of has those little

01:48:38.220 --> 01:48:40.460
graphics and a little bit of pac-man

01:48:40.460 --> 01:48:43.380
versus elements but here's the deal in

01:48:43.380 --> 01:48:45.260
pac-man versus the other players are

01:48:45.260 --> 01:48:46.820
playing as ghosts but that's not what's

01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:48.900
happening here everybody is playing as

01:48:48.900 --> 01:48:52.100
different pac-man but pac-man can eat

01:48:52.100 --> 01:48:54.060
the other pac-man's with a specific

01:48:54.060 --> 01:48:56.340
powerup and here's the coolest part of

01:48:56.340 --> 01:48:59.700
all it's a cocktail cabinet so it's a

01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:02.260
table that's the cabinet they're playing

01:49:02.260 --> 01:49:03.460
it on it's one of those old cocktail

01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:04.740
but you know the lamest part about it is

01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:06.020
what you dots doesn't give you any

01:49:06.020 --> 01:49:07.580
points there's no points in the game

01:49:07.580 --> 01:49:09.100
other than eating the other players or

01:49:09.100 --> 01:49:10.300
being the last one to survive I would

01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:12.100
imagine eating the dots is how you power

01:49:12.100 --> 01:49:14.780
up it's basically it's basically how you

01:49:14.780 --> 01:49:16.700
eating the dots is basically how you

01:49:16.700 --> 01:49:18.820
trigger more dots appear and more power

01:49:18.820 --> 01:49:20.660
ups in here yeah did you grow like super

01:49:20.660 --> 01:49:23.140
pac-man yes you do that is beautiful yeah

01:49:23.140 --> 01:49:25.120
and it's a freaking cocktail cabinet

01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:27.980
that's the coolest part honestly so

correct because pac-man is a proper name

01:49:45.980 --> 01:49:49.500
therefore pac-man's would be correct

01:49:49.500 --> 01:49:52.820
instead of pac-man now if pac-man is his

01:49:52.820 --> 01:49:56.180

01:53:09.980 --> 01:53:11.580
tonight by the way later on tonight in

01:53:11.580 --> 01:53:13.980
part B our good friend Aaron also known

01:53:13.980 --> 01:53:15.540
as why YR is going to be back because

01:53:15.540 --> 01:53:17.260
apparently he has released a new game

01:53:17.260 --> 01:53:20.300
tonight is it a sequel to three snake

01:53:20.300 --> 01:53:23.860
360 no but it's still retro tastic

01:53:23.860 --> 01:53:25.540
already awesome as if it was gorillas

01:53:25.540 --> 01:53:28.660
360 instead of snakes yeah you will know

01:53:28.660 --> 01:53:31.060
remember gorillas were the old basic

01:53:31.060 --> 01:53:33.900
game that you get with dog yes yes well

01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:36.340
you might say that this is penguins 360

01:53:36.340 --> 01:53:38.420
so we'll talk about that in a little

01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:40.260
while we'll go talk about that that but

01:53:40.260 --> 01:53:41.660
it released like literally like 30

01:53:41.660 --> 01:53:43.100
minutes ago or something like that on

01:53:43.100 --> 01:53:45.500
the Xbox indie game so we will talk

01:53:45.500 --> 01:53:48.220
about that in just a moment okay but

01:53:48.220 --> 01:53:50.620
first some Twitter topics and I was not

01:53:50.620 --> 01:53:52.900
a good host tonight and forgot to remind

01:53:52.900 --> 01:53:54.460
people to post their Twitter topics but

01:53:54.460 --> 01:53:56.660
that's okay like I don't want the

01:53:56.660 --> 01:53:57.820
segment to be that long tonight so we

01:53:57.820 --> 01:53:59.180
have listless tonight and now we have an

01:53:59.180 --> 01:54:01.580
interview in part B so um yeah we got to

01:54:01.580 --> 01:54:04.980
uh hurry hurry all right let's see

01:54:04.980 --> 01:54:08.300
starting off with Tiger Claw 305 linking

01:54:08.300 --> 01:54:11.700
us to a story about how McDonald's uses

01:54:11.700 --> 01:54:15.180
the DS to train part-time workers it's a

01:54:15.180 --> 01:54:17.780
DS based training now keep in mind this

01:54:17.780 --> 01:54:18.820
isn't something that's happening in

01:54:18.820 --> 01:54:20.260
America but it's something that's

01:54:20.260 --> 01:54:22.540
working with McDonald's Japan they

01:54:22.540 --> 01:54:24.420
actually use the DS as a training tool

01:54:24.420 --> 01:54:26.420
using a training program called e smart

01:54:26.420 --> 01:54:28.700
so a part-time employee will train

01:54:28.700 --> 01:54:31.180
through the software it's gonna be used

01:54:31.180 --> 01:54:34.340
in 3700 stores all around Japan and the

01:54:34.340 --> 01:54:36.780
program's cost is about 200 million yen

01:54:36.780 --> 01:54:38.500
not that somebody actually has to pay

01:54:38.500 --> 01:54:39.900
that that's how much it cost to develop

01:54:39.900 --> 01:54:41.620
and everything McDonald's thinks it can

01:54:41.620 --> 01:54:43.900
cut the training time in half by over

01:54:43.900 --> 01:54:47.020
half by using this new system because

01:54:47.020 --> 01:54:48.860
lots of people already know how to use

01:54:48.860 --> 01:54:50.580
the DS and they want to get employees

01:54:50.580 --> 01:54:53.100
quickly out on the floor kind of

01:54:53.100 --> 01:54:56.100
interesting I got to admit my day job if

01:54:56.100 --> 01:54:57.380
you didn't know happens it has to do a

01:54:57.380 --> 01:54:59.100
training I trained for a big corporation

01:54:59.100 --> 01:55:01.700
and not McDonald's but you know a

01:55:01.700 --> 01:55:04.340
different corporation and I'm always

01:55:04.340 --> 01:55:05.380
interested in these types of new

01:55:05.380 --> 01:55:09.020
training tools I guess you know if you

01:55:09.020 --> 01:55:10.940
can make sure that employees are

01:55:10.940 --> 01:55:12.420
comprehending the information given and

01:55:12.420 --> 01:55:14.940
it's a fun interactive way to learn why

01:55:14.940 --> 01:55:17.220
not at least a much easier way to get

01:55:17.220 --> 01:55:19.020
some of the quote-unquote boring stuff

01:55:19.020 --> 01:55:20.500
out of the way for lack of a better term

01:55:20.500 --> 01:55:26.180
um let's see going on to blue swim

01:55:26.180 --> 01:55:28.580
Twitter question did you guys take

01:55:28.580 --> 01:55:31.660
advantage of Kmart's $10 off $20 plus

01:55:31.660 --> 01:55:33.940
coupon overnight apparently there was an

01:55:33.940 --> 01:55:36.140
online coupon for its NYC stores that

01:55:36.140 --> 01:55:38.220
wasn't region locked allowing people

01:55:38.220 --> 01:55:40.900
everywhere to use it no I hadn't heard

01:55:40.900 --> 01:55:42.660
and I would be real it would be really

01:55:42.660 --> 01:55:44.300
hard to get me to set foot in a Kmart

01:55:44.300 --> 01:55:46.340
anyway I guess it came out around the

01:55:46.340 --> 01:55:48.220
corner but you know free money is a

01:55:48.220 --> 01:55:49.980
pretty good way to do it I gotta say so

01:55:49.980 --> 01:55:54.100
oops we started to have mailbag music

01:55:54.100 --> 01:55:55.100
play in the background there we don't

01:55:55.100 --> 01:55:58.340
want that s to 100 Matt is linking us to

01:55:58.340 --> 01:56:01.020
a story about an apple related incident

01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:03.260
where Apple apparently banned a game

01:56:03.260 --> 01:56:05.300
developer because he called the store

01:56:05.300 --> 01:56:08.180
awful and horrible is the developers

01:56:08.180 --> 01:56:11.780
name was Tommy reference and the Apple

01:56:11.780 --> 01:56:15.340
removed his app zits and giggles well

01:56:15.340 --> 01:56:16.940
for starters that just needed to be

01:56:16.940 --> 01:56:20.460
removed but whatever apparently the

01:56:20.460 --> 01:56:22.340
creator was that game developers

01:56:22.340 --> 01:56:25.860
conference and he said that he absolutely

01:56:25.860 --> 01:56:28.420
fucking hates the iPhone app store he

01:56:28.420 --> 01:56:30.380
said that the iPhone gaming market is

01:56:30.380 --> 01:56:32.540
like the Tigard handheld games of sorry

01:56:32.540 --> 01:56:34.500
the tiger handheld games of the 80s and

01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:36.460
90s you might remember those crappy

01:56:36.460 --> 01:56:38.300
little LCD games like mr. game and watch

01:56:38.300 --> 01:56:42.020
esque stuff also zits and giggles this

01:56:42.020 --> 01:56:43.740
is the guy this is the company and I

01:56:43.740 --> 01:56:44.860
think we've talked about on the store

01:56:44.860 --> 01:56:47.100
they would keep raising the price of

01:56:47.100 --> 01:56:48.580
their game to see who would keep buying

01:56:48.580 --> 01:56:50.700
it and they had raised it up to over

01:56:50.700 --> 01:56:52.980
four hundred dollars apple of course

01:56:52.980 --> 01:56:56.060
didn't tell any reason why they took the

01:56:56.060 --> 01:56:59.460
game down so there you go but maybe had

01:56:59.460 --> 01:57:00.740
to be with the fact that he was acting

01:57:00.740 --> 01:57:03.540
like a dick and if you bite the hand

01:57:03.540 --> 01:57:05.380
that feeds you they're probably going to

01:57:05.380 --> 01:57:10.380
cut you off I own o tropic asks puzzle

01:57:10.380 --> 01:57:13.220
quest to discuss the puzzle crack puzzle

01:57:13.220 --> 01:57:15.580
quest 2 is not out yet is it it's not

01:57:15.580 --> 01:57:17.780
out yet it's coming out Alan I know

01:57:17.780 --> 01:57:19.300
you're a big puzzle quest fan and you

01:57:19.300 --> 01:57:20.900
like the gyromancers and those types of

01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:22.580
games what do you want in a puzzle quest

01:57:22.580 --> 01:57:24.020
to is there anything you're looking for

01:57:24.020 --> 01:57:29.060
um just have it not be Galactrix really

01:57:29.060 --> 01:57:31.300
it's not Galactrix this time no they're

01:57:31.300 --> 01:57:32.900
going back to the old school puzzle

01:57:32.900 --> 01:57:35.620
quest it's more yield a bejeweling yeah

01:57:35.620 --> 01:57:37.700
so there you just want more of the same

01:57:37.700 --> 01:57:40.620
you know no features you get to go well

01:57:40.620 --> 01:57:43.300
they have like pickle quests or something

01:57:43.300 --> 01:57:45.700
like that you know pickle quest I think

01:57:45.700 --> 01:57:48.140
our soccer be all over that pick pickle

01:57:48.140 --> 01:57:52.220
nights with a K pickle death all right

01:57:52.220 --> 01:57:54.500
and lastly act death links us to the

01:57:54.500 --> 01:57:56.620
story Australia is closer to getting m

01:57:56.620 --> 01:57:59.100
rated games it says the tweet that came

01:57:59.100 --> 01:58:02.220
to us at olr Lincoln is this story about

01:58:02.220 --> 01:58:04.540
somebody I guess who is stepping down

01:58:04.540 --> 01:58:07.700
Michael Atkinson is the South Australian

01:58:07.700 --> 01:58:10.020
Attorney General and apparently he's the

01:58:10.020 --> 01:58:12.980
reason why there is no r18 plus rating

01:58:12.980 --> 01:58:14.940
for games he's stepping down and the

01:58:14.940 --> 01:58:17.260
thought is maybe somebody will get in

01:58:17.260 --> 01:58:18.340
there that knows what they're talking

01:58:18.340 --> 01:58:20.260
about with this rating system so maybe

01:58:20.260 --> 01:58:21.540
we won't have so many stories about

01:58:21.540 --> 01:58:24.340
Australia gets such-and-such banned game

01:58:24.340 --> 01:58:26.220
or what have you in the future that

01:58:26.220 --> 01:58:28.260
would be exciting for them we'll hope at

01:58:28.260 --> 01:58:31.060
least anyway for them all right let's

01:58:31.060 --> 01:58:32.940
get back into some news the Loki which

01:58:32.940 --> 01:58:35.940
got forced tonight apparently Pikmin 3

01:58:35.940 --> 01:58:38.500
is in development and Miyamoto has

01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:40.820
confirmed that I believe he confirmed it

01:58:40.820 --> 01:58:43.180
before though if you ask me but whatever

01:58:43.180 --> 01:58:45.180
apparently the official Nintendo

01:58:45.180 --> 01:58:48.820
magazine in the UK was saying that you

01:58:48.820 --> 01:58:51.940
know Miyamoto has confirmed that Pikmin

01:58:51.940 --> 01:58:54.620
3 development is well underway over a

01:58:54.620 --> 01:58:57.700
year ago it was rumored to be released

01:58:57.700 --> 01:59:00.820
apparently around this time but it's not

01:59:00.820 --> 01:59:07.180
obviously and no word exactly what

01:59:07.180 --> 01:59:08.740
they're going to change about it

01:59:08.740 --> 01:59:12.500
apparently the thought is maybe they're

01:59:12.500 --> 01:59:16.660
going to announce something e3 I don't

01:59:16.660 --> 01:59:18.220
know I've never really got into the

01:59:18.220 --> 01:59:19.900
Pikmin games it's sort of like perfect

01:59:19.900 --> 01:59:21.540
dark for me I'd never really played it

01:59:21.540 --> 01:59:23.660
before I don't know if you think this is

01:59:23.660 --> 01:59:25.100
a game I would enjoy or what is the

01:59:25.100 --> 01:59:27.420
appeal of Pikmin to the masses I have no

01:59:27.420 --> 01:59:30.180
idea to be honest I never played them

01:59:30.180 --> 01:59:32.180
and I know when they were released the

01:59:32.180 --> 01:59:36.100
GameCube one they only did the first

01:59:36.100 --> 01:59:37.820
GameCube one over here too because they

01:59:37.820 --> 01:59:40.220
had the second one come out in Japan but

01:59:40.220 --> 01:59:42.740
that new play control series I don't

01:59:42.740 --> 01:59:45.660
think it did very well over here and a

01:59:45.660 --> 01:59:47.180
lot of the games didn't get released I

01:59:47.180 --> 01:59:48.660
got released isn't that Nintendo's

01:59:48.660 --> 01:59:50.660
lesson learned like stop supporting the

01:59:50.660 --> 01:59:53.340
same shit we already had exactly and I'm

01:59:53.340 --> 01:59:55.660
just gonna tell you right now Pikmin 3

01:59:55.660 --> 01:59:56.580
is probably not going to be any

01:59:56.580 --> 01:59:59.580
different than Pikmin 2 it'll just be on

01:59:59.580 --> 02:00:01.420
the Wii and you'll buy it anyways

02:00:01.420 --> 02:00:03.500
because you're sucker but I don't think

02:00:03.500 --> 02:00:05.300
this is gonna have the same draw as like

02:00:05.300 --> 02:00:08.140
say a Mario Galaxy or something like

02:00:08.140 --> 02:00:11.260
that and you know and not that this

02:00:11.260 --> 02:00:13.100
would be a horrible thing I think it

02:00:13.100 --> 02:00:15.100
would be a very cheap thing to do but I

02:00:15.100 --> 02:00:17.580
could see Nintendo doing another new

02:00:17.580 --> 02:00:20.380
Super Mario Brothers game this soon you

02:00:20.380 --> 02:00:21.740
know what I mean very it's very possible

02:00:21.740 --> 02:00:24.740
I went to the chat room and I asked in

02:00:24.740 --> 02:00:26.900
chat at chat.ownersloudestrader.com I

02:00:26.900 --> 02:00:28.620
said chat help me out what is the appeal

02:00:28.620 --> 02:00:30.580
of Pikmin and G Ditz replied is there

02:00:30.580 --> 02:00:33.220
any? Hackdeft replied Pikmin is basically

02:00:33.220 --> 02:00:36.580
an RTS but cute so that is apparently

02:00:36.580 --> 02:00:40.140
what it is it's an RTS but cute so there

02:00:40.140 --> 02:00:43.420
you go and ToaGak seems to think if

02:00:43.420 --> 02:00:45.860
Pikmin 3 does not equal 2 then 3 does

02:00:45.860 --> 02:00:48.620
not equal 1 Frisbee says Pikmin was

02:00:48.620 --> 02:00:50.980
great nine years ago Lama Juice says I

02:00:50.980 --> 02:00:52.420
like Pikmin 1 I thought the game was

02:00:52.420 --> 02:00:55.380
really fun so I don't know it's just one of those

02:00:55.380 --> 02:00:57.580
games I never got around to playing so ToaGak

02:00:57.580 --> 02:00:59.660
also chimes in and says I fucking hate

02:00:59.660 --> 02:01:02.060
the new play controls. Spike McCrew says

02:01:02.060 --> 02:01:04.620
it's got calm music. So we need a new

02:01:04.620 --> 02:01:07.980
Star Fox or a new F-Zero that's what we

02:01:07.980 --> 02:01:13.260
need for Pikmin so all right well I've

02:01:13.260 --> 02:01:14.740
got another story for you guys and it

02:01:14.740 --> 02:01:17.820
has to do with the first lady Michelle

02:01:17.820 --> 02:01:20.500
Obama yes video games and the White

02:01:20.500 --> 02:01:23.020
House believe it or not and apparently

02:01:23.020 --> 02:01:27.100
it's because the government has kind of

02:01:27.100 --> 02:01:29.900
in a way endorsed Dance Dance Revolution

02:01:29.900 --> 02:01:32.180
okay let me explain how this works here

02:01:32.180 --> 02:01:34.860
let's move is a new program and first

02:01:34.860 --> 02:01:36.460
lady Michelle Obama was there for the

02:01:36.460 --> 02:01:38.460
kickoff and she actually mentioned the

02:01:38.460 --> 02:01:40.820
game by name in her speech she said and

02:01:40.820 --> 02:01:42.660
I have to say that many of you have been

02:01:42.660 --> 02:01:44.620
very creative on this piece already

02:01:44.620 --> 02:01:47.280
folks in West Virginia have taken the

02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:49.820
lead in bringing DDR that's Dance Dance

02:01:49.820 --> 02:01:51.660
Revolution it's a new video game that

02:01:51.660 --> 02:01:54.260
gets kids up and moving haha new the

02:01:54.260 --> 02:01:56.540
game's been around since what 98 many

02:01:56.540 --> 02:01:58.220
other states use it as well and let me

02:01:58.220 --> 02:02:00.020
tell you I can attest to Dance Dance

02:02:00.020 --> 02:02:02.220
Revolution we got it at Camp David and

02:02:02.220 --> 02:02:04.020
it'll make you sweat and it's addictive

02:02:04.020 --> 02:02:05.700
in a very good way the president still

02:02:05.700 --> 02:02:08.960
can't do it so anyhow that's cute I want

02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:11.460
to point out that let's move is not just

02:02:11.460 --> 02:02:13.540
about DDR though but it's more about

02:02:13.540 --> 02:02:16.460
getting you know kids and stuff up and

02:02:16.460 --> 02:02:18.980
moving so it's a good thing they didn't

02:02:18.980 --> 02:02:22.740
call the program let them move though a

02:02:22.740 --> 02:02:26.620
big groan from the DDR crowd I would

02:02:26.620 --> 02:02:28.380
find them I love the fact though that

02:02:28.380 --> 02:02:31.940
it's a quote-unquote new video game well

02:02:31.940 --> 02:02:33.900
technically that's true they're making

02:02:33.900 --> 02:02:36.300
new video games in that series all the

02:02:36.300 --> 02:02:40.340
time it's just it's nowhere near new so

02:02:40.340 --> 02:02:43.100
all right dark soccer's got a story for

02:02:43.100 --> 02:02:46.220
us and then listless is coming up well

02:02:46.220 --> 02:02:51.860
um steam is of course removing

02:02:51.860 --> 02:02:54.860
Assassin's Creed 2 and silent hunter 5

02:02:54.860 --> 02:02:57.100
but it says it wasn't because of the DRM

02:02:57.100 --> 02:03:02.500
they are actually available in places

02:03:02.500 --> 02:03:05.420
other than steam it's just specifically

02:03:05.420 --> 02:03:10.740
that steam UK didn't wasn't wanting to

02:03:10.740 --> 02:03:13.020
deal with it they said that it has to do

02:03:13.020 --> 02:03:15.140
with local business discussion between

02:03:15.140 --> 02:03:18.180
Ubisoft and steam in the UK but yeah but

02:03:18.180 --> 02:03:25.140
it's no longer available well I guess I

02:03:25.140 --> 02:03:27.780
want to try to fix it well you know I

02:03:27.780 --> 02:03:29.820
know steam is denying it and it's

02:03:29.820 --> 02:03:32.300
probably accurate because it sounds like

02:03:32.300 --> 02:03:34.940
this is isolated to overseas it's not

02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:36.980
really happening here UK specific yeah

02:03:36.980 --> 02:03:40.340
so but but I still go back to the point

02:03:40.340 --> 02:03:41.580
I was saying before when I was talking

02:03:41.580 --> 02:03:43.700
about how Ubisoft DRM is not just going

02:03:43.700 --> 02:03:46.060
to get Ubisoft in trouble that they're

02:03:46.060 --> 02:03:48.700
going to be calling places like Target

02:03:48.700 --> 02:03:50.420
and Walmart where people buy these games

02:03:50.420 --> 02:03:52.260
say my game doesn't work and returning

02:03:52.260 --> 02:03:53.740
it and the retailer is going to get

02:03:53.740 --> 02:03:55.180
caught in the middle and the minute that

02:03:55.180 --> 02:03:56.300
starts happening they're going to stop

02:03:56.300 --> 02:03:58.300
carrying these games so I think it's

02:03:58.300 --> 02:04:00.180
ridiculous anything I'll ask any of this

02:04:00.180 --> 02:04:04.380
through all right well folks it is that

02:04:04.380 --> 02:04:06.260
time and we haven't done this in a

02:04:06.260 --> 02:04:07.740
little while on the show but I'm very

02:04:07.740 --> 02:04:09.100
excited that tonight we are bringing

02:04:09.100 --> 02:04:16.580
back for a 360 episode listless okay

02:04:16.580 --> 02:04:18.860
now there's a lot of people in our chat

02:04:18.860 --> 02:04:20.660
room that are kind of newer to the show

02:04:20.660 --> 02:04:21.820
and they don't know how this works so

02:04:21.820 --> 02:04:23.820
let me explain it for you guys what we're

02:04:23.820 --> 02:04:24.860
going to do is we're going to go around

02:04:24.860 --> 02:04:26.700
the room and we are going to create the

02:04:26.700 --> 02:04:29.220
definitive list about a certain topic

02:04:29.220 --> 02:04:31.780
and tonight's topic is the great idea

02:04:31.780 --> 02:04:33.860
that Microsoft should steal and make

02:04:33.860 --> 02:04:36.100
better next sometimes our answers are

02:04:36.100 --> 02:04:37.780
serious sometimes they're silly

02:04:37.780 --> 02:04:40.060
sometimes they're completely nonsensical

02:04:40.060 --> 02:04:42.340
but like it or not it is the list that

02:04:42.340 --> 02:04:44.660
we have come up with for the question

02:04:44.660 --> 02:04:47.060
now once all four of us since we have

02:04:47.060 --> 02:04:49.300
our special guest Alan tonight come up

02:04:49.300 --> 02:04:51.100
with our list we'll have a list of 12

02:04:51.100 --> 02:04:54.140
then the hard part comes we will each go

02:04:54.140 --> 02:04:56.980
around the room and remove one item from

02:04:56.980 --> 02:04:58.660
the list usually it's someone else's

02:04:58.660 --> 02:04:59.900
item but you can remove your own I

02:04:59.900 --> 02:05:01.260
suppose if you are feeling cannibalistic

02:05:01.260 --> 02:05:03.340
like that that will leave us with a list

02:05:03.340 --> 02:05:05.940
of eight then our chat room will vote

02:05:05.940 --> 02:05:08.180
for their number one and number two

02:05:08.180 --> 02:05:10.460
favorite in a private message to me and

02:05:10.460 --> 02:05:14.860
then your top three answers based on

02:05:14.860 --> 02:05:16.420
your votes will come up with our

02:05:16.420 --> 02:05:20.220
definitive list now keep in mind you can

02:05:20.220 --> 02:05:21.620
send us private message now if you have

02:05:21.620 --> 02:05:23.340
an answer if you want to help the hosts

02:05:23.340 --> 02:05:26.180
out and because you know sometimes we

02:05:26.180 --> 02:05:27.940
are thinking of topics right on the

02:05:27.940 --> 02:05:29.820
right in the heat of the moment I'm

02:05:29.820 --> 02:05:32.980
Loki you can yell out your answers in

02:05:32.980 --> 02:05:34.540
chat right now and they might get

02:05:34.540 --> 02:05:37.100
included in the host list so again that

02:05:37.100 --> 02:05:40.580
is the great idea that Microsoft

02:05:40.580 --> 02:05:43.660
Microsoft Microsoft Microsoft Microsoft

02:05:43.660 --> 02:05:47.140
Microsoft I never met a carrot I didn't

02:05:47.140 --> 02:05:49.740
like except for this one the great idea

02:05:49.740 --> 02:05:52.860
that Microsoft should steal next all

02:05:52.860 --> 02:05:54.540
right who wants to start us off tonight

02:05:54.540 --> 02:05:57.060
Loki I'll call on you and see if you did

02:05:57.060 --> 02:05:59.860
your homework your number three answer

02:05:59.860 --> 02:06:02.060
for the great idea because again I want

02:06:02.060 --> 02:06:02.980
to remind you guys where this topic

02:06:02.980 --> 02:06:06.460
comes from project Natal stolen motion

02:06:06.460 --> 02:06:10.820
controller basically Xbox live kind of

02:06:10.820 --> 02:06:12.500
taking some things from PC gaming and

02:06:12.500 --> 02:06:15.180
incorporating into their games you know

02:06:15.180 --> 02:06:17.620
the Xbox takes other people's ideas not

02:06:17.620 --> 02:06:18.540
that there's anything wrong with that

02:06:18.540 --> 02:06:20.180
because they make them better they take

02:06:20.180 --> 02:06:21.100
other people's ideas and make them

02:06:21.100 --> 02:06:24.380
better all right so here we go what

02:06:24.380 --> 02:06:27.180
should they improve next and I guess it

02:06:27.180 --> 02:06:28.820
doesn't have to be gaming related but it

02:06:28.820 --> 02:06:30.700
helps all right Loki what is your oops I

02:06:30.700 --> 02:06:32.620
gotta get my own little whiteboard up

02:06:32.620 --> 02:06:34.500
here to keep track of our answers Loki

02:06:34.500 --> 02:06:36.500
what is your number three answer for the

02:06:36.500 --> 02:06:39.060
idea that they should steal next the PSP

02:06:39.060 --> 02:06:42.420
the PSP so making like a handheld system

02:06:42.420 --> 02:06:44.900
essentially you're just the PSP no a

02:06:44.900 --> 02:06:47.300
handheld system they shouldn't exactly

02:06:47.300 --> 02:06:49.180
make it like the PSP but like you know

02:06:49.180 --> 02:06:51.060
something that's a widescreen you know

02:09:19.180 --> 02:09:21.060
Foreman grilling to the next level by

02:09:21.060 --> 02:09:23.620

particular reason why that it would help

02:10:06.740 --> 02:10:09.380

02:10:09.380 --> 02:10:11.460

my number two answer let's see where is

02:10:14.220 --> 02:10:16.460
my list my number two answer idea that

02:10:16.460 --> 02:10:18.900
Xbox should steal and make better a game

02:10:18.900 --> 02:10:20.780
starring a fat plumber and his brother

02:10:20.780 --> 02:10:22.880
and a game starring a fruity elf with

02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:26.140
big ears is my number to answer so

02:10:26.140 --> 02:10:28.140
that's a mouthful there but you know I

02:10:28.140 --> 02:10:29.540
just it worked for some of their

02:10:29.540 --> 02:10:31.760
competitors so my number two answer a

02:10:31.760 --> 02:10:33.440
game starring a fat plumber and his

02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:35.920
brother and a game starring a fruity elf

02:10:35.920 --> 02:10:39.420
with big ears there you go now we're

02:10:39.420 --> 02:10:40.940
gonna go around and get everybody's

02:10:40.940 --> 02:10:43.140
number one answer let me read the list

02:10:43.140 --> 02:10:50.020
list for you guys so far. A handheld system, Pokemans, the Colonel's recipe, the hot lesbian

02:10:50.020 --> 02:10:55.820
tester, George Foreman full cow grilling machine, an expansion module for other system games,

02:10:55.820 --> 02:10:59.620
visual memory cards, a game starring a fat plumber and his brother, and a game starring

02:10:59.620 --> 02:11:06.880
a fruity elf with big ears. Alright, now we get down to the number one answers. The number

02:11:06.880 --> 02:11:13.140
one thing you most want to see the Xbox 360 steal and make better. Loki. Well if they're

02:11:13.140 --> 02:11:19.020
going to be guaranteed to make something better, I can't think of a better response than sex.

02:11:19.020 --> 02:11:26.400
They have, there's not really much better than sex but I guess if they're going to find

02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:33.380
a way to make it better, more power to them. So yes, Microsoft impressed me by making something

02:11:33.380 --> 02:11:47.880
better than sex. There you go. Make sex better. You know what, Microsoft actually can't because

02:11:47.880 --> 02:11:53.560
there's already toys. No, I'm saying they've got to find a way. They have an obligation

02:11:53.560 --> 02:11:59.740
to steal it and make it better. So sex is what it is. Would that be like a peripheral?

02:11:59.740 --> 02:12:12.020
Whatever it takes. They would have to defeat Hello Kitty in the Hitachi Magic Wand. Dare

02:12:12.020 --> 02:12:16.660
I ask for your number one answer, what should they steal and make better? Rainbow farting

02:12:16.660 --> 02:12:23.100
unicorns. Rainbow farting unicorns. Is that, are you talking about, what is that, robot

02:12:23.100 --> 02:12:26.900
magic unicorn or whatever it is? Whatever it is. What's the name of the game? Well my

02:12:26.900 --> 02:12:32.820
original answer, my original answer was Propel. Propel, but you want robot unicorn attack.

02:12:32.820 --> 02:12:42.820
Farty robot unicorns. It's, it's rainbow farting unicorns. Yeah. Rainbow farting. Rainbow farting

02:12:42.820 --> 02:12:47.580
or farting? Farting. Robot unicorns. That's a special attack cause they fart. There you

02:12:47.580 --> 02:12:52.780
go. Alright. To an all eraser soundtrack. To an all eraser soundtrack, you got it. Or

02:12:52.780 --> 02:13:01.620
Netshot Boys works too. Dark Sakura, you need to let it go. Okay, your number one answer,

02:13:01.620 --> 02:13:05.660
Ellen, what is your number one answer for a thing you want Microsoft to steal and make

02:13:05.660 --> 02:13:13.620
better? He's thinking. I'm blanking. You're blanking? After the sex thing. After the sex

02:13:13.620 --> 02:13:23.780
thing you just can't? Help ya? Sure. The Bible. Okay, yeah. Jesus. If they could do Jesus.

02:13:23.780 --> 02:13:30.620
Super Jesus. You don't want to do the YouTube you sent me earlier? Alright, fine. Alright.

02:13:30.620 --> 02:13:38.780
Jesus is the idea that they're going to steal and make better. Okay. Oh lord. Alright, and

02:13:38.780 --> 02:13:44.580
my number one answer. I, I don't know. I just kind of decided to go for the obvious. Blu-ray.

02:13:44.580 --> 02:13:51.820
They already did. It was HD DVD. But it wasn't really better. I mean, and they were can't

02:13:51.820 --> 02:13:55.660
kind of came out at the same time, but now that Blu-ray is out, they can take Blu-ray

02:13:55.660 --> 02:14:03.560
and make it better. Alright. Robot Jesus attack. That'd be kind of cool. Here's the list as

02:14:03.560 --> 02:14:09.080
it stands before the elimination. A handheld system. Pokemans. The Colonel's recipe. The

02:14:09.080 --> 02:14:13.940
hot lesbian tester. George Foreman's full cow grilling machine. An expansion module

02:14:13.940 --> 02:14:18.760
for other system games. Visual memory cards. A game starring a fat plumber and his brother

02:14:18.760 --> 02:14:25.100
in a game starring a fruity elf with big ears. Sex. Rainbow farting robot unicorns. Jesus

02:14:25.100 --> 02:14:31.580
and Blu-ray. Things that Microsoft is going to steal and make better. Loki. What is not

02:14:31.580 --> 02:14:36.100
worthy of being on the list? Unfortunately, we got to narrow this down to eight is a tough

02:14:36.100 --> 02:14:41.140
process. Feelings will be hurt. Hair will be pulled, but it must happen. Loki. Which

02:14:41.140 --> 02:14:45.260
of these is not worthy of the list? Blu-ray because it's going to get phased out anyways.

02:14:45.260 --> 02:14:50.900
You're a bastard. All right. Blu-rays off the list. Dark Sakura. Which of these is not

02:14:50.900 --> 02:15:00.060
worthy of the list? Sex. You eliminated sex. It's overrated. They're going to make it better.

02:15:00.060 --> 02:15:09.900
Come on. Better sex. I mean, this is dark soccer has eliminated from the list. Why?

02:15:09.900 --> 02:15:14.140
I don't want it on the list. No, I understand, but it's just funny. Our chat room is going

02:15:14.140 --> 02:15:19.060
to yell on screen. There's going to be hair pulling. It's boring. It is boring. They're

02:15:19.060 --> 02:15:23.980
going to make it better. No, it'll, it'll launch. And then all of a sudden red rings.

02:15:23.980 --> 02:15:30.020
Oh no. And it won't matter for the guys involved. They never have a problem. I don't want to

02:15:30.020 --> 02:15:36.260
wear red rings on my balls. All right. It'll be, it'll be over before the women enjoy it.

02:15:36.260 --> 02:15:43.500
All right. Alan, which of these is not worthy? Oh, dark soccer is getting booed by chat.

02:15:43.500 --> 02:15:51.500
Go in there and regulate dark soccer. All right. Alan, which of these is not worthy

02:15:51.500 --> 02:15:58.860
of the list? The hot lesbian tester. Oh, you bastard. Why do you not love lesbians? No

02:15:58.860 --> 02:16:04.580
way to messing around person. Why are you taking the hot lesbian tester off the list?

02:16:04.580 --> 02:16:13.660
I don't know. Just cause it's my answer. Dick. All right. You're going to, you're going to

02:16:13.660 --> 02:16:19.960
wish that the three 60 had the sex support pretty soon. All right. Um, the item I'm going

02:16:19.960 --> 02:16:25.700
to eliminate from the list. Um, I am taking off, I'm taking off the George Foreman full

02:16:25.700 --> 02:16:31.140
cow grilling machine because that joke is so 2007. It's the PS three that looks like

02:16:31.140 --> 02:16:35.860
one. Yeah. I don't want them to copy that. That's the PS three things. Let Sony have

02:16:35.860 --> 02:16:40.700
something. All right. So that's why I've eliminated from the list. So here we go. Lim can only

02:16:40.700 --> 02:16:46.940
do veal. These are the eight that you can vote for tonight. A handheld system pokey

02:16:46.940 --> 02:16:53.400
man's the Colonel's recipe, an expansion module for other system games, visual memory cards,

02:16:53.400 --> 02:16:57.700
a game starring a fat plumber and his brother in a game starring a fruity elf with big ears,

02:16:57.700 --> 02:17:03.840
rainbow farting robot unicorns and Jesus, which of these should they steal and make

02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:12.640
better? Send a private message to sky in the chat room with your two votes. And if you

02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:18.200
want the blur beta code, I have two to give away tonight. Send in your votes and the message

02:17:18.200 --> 02:17:23.160
that says, I want the blur beta code or something along those lines. If you don't want the blur

02:17:23.160 --> 02:17:27.760
beta code, don't send me that message, but you can still send me your votes. Okay. So

02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:34.080
you send me an additional message that says, um, I want the blur beta code. All right.

02:17:34.080 --> 02:17:38.280
If you don't know how to send a private message, I will recap that process for you in chat

02:17:38.280 --> 02:17:45.480
real soon for now, back to the show. While those votes come in, some folks in chat said,

02:17:45.480 --> 02:17:48.800
we made the list boring. We took off every single interesting answer. We took off the

02:17:48.800 --> 02:17:54.200
lesbians, the sex, the meat. Everything was gone. All right. Uh, by the way, the beta

02:17:54.200 --> 02:17:59.300
code is only on the three 60. You must have a three 60. Please do not ask for the code.

02:17:59.300 --> 02:18:02.960
If you yourself are not going to use it. If you sell that shit on eBay, I will find you

02:18:02.960 --> 02:18:10.160
and I will end your life. All right. Moving on. She didn't really sell those codes. I

02:18:10.160 --> 02:18:14.020
mean, considering that they're floating around. Exactly. All right. Loki, what do you have

02:18:14.020 --> 02:18:21.180
for us while I start to tally up the votes? Um, so Bethesda and in exile have announced

02:18:21.180 --> 02:18:25.060
that they're going to be putting out a new game called hunted the demons forge. It's

02:18:25.060 --> 02:18:32.200
a co-op, looks like a hack and slash game. Kind of looks neat. And um, they say it's

02:18:32.200 --> 02:18:38.920
going to take us back to our roots. And apparently it's like a warriors and archers and putting

02:18:38.920 --> 02:18:45.080
holes through things with sharp objects. And apparently it will be in, it's in development

02:18:45.080 --> 02:18:53.640
for Xbox three 60 and PS three and games for windows. And this was, I don't know, gets

02:18:53.640 --> 02:18:58.380
shown off at a GDC. Was this like the top secret game that Bethesda is supposedly working

02:18:58.380 --> 02:19:02.460
on that everybody thought was the blizzard MMO? I don't know, but it looks like it's

02:19:02.460 --> 02:19:08.800
just like a hack and slash game. Looks cool though. It looks really neat, but I mean,

02:19:08.800 --> 02:19:12.920
I don't know if this is the top secret game they're working on and this is Bethesda, not

02:19:12.920 --> 02:19:20.260
blizzard. All right. Oh, I meant to say Bethesda. I say blizzard. Sorry. I'm getting distracted

02:19:20.260 --> 02:19:24.760
with the cage, uh, tallying the votes for, um, listless right now. Um, let me get to

02:19:24.760 --> 02:19:33.560
this next story real quick about layoffs at IGN. Unfortunately layoffs have, uh, hit IGN

02:19:33.560 --> 02:19:38.900
and um, yep, too bad. So sad. Sorry to hear it. Uh, but unfortunately a lot of folks got

02:19:38.900 --> 02:19:45.640
laid off over at IGN and um, I don't know, I guess that'll be less podcast now. All right.

02:19:45.640 --> 02:19:53.320
Times are tough and it's not funny when people lose their jobs, but um, you know, it's tough

02:19:53.320 --> 02:20:00.400
out there. It's hard out there for a pimp. What can I say? If they really love games,

02:20:00.400 --> 02:20:04.560
there'll be people doing it for free, just like, um, you know, many other people do.

02:20:04.560 --> 02:20:08.240
So we'll see. No one in particular, Rob, right? No, no one in particular. All right, let's

02:20:08.240 --> 02:20:12.200
get to the mailbag. Every week you guys send us emails, mailbag at orange lounge reader.com

02:20:12.200 --> 02:20:18.200
and we read some here on air. Darkstalker is going to open up the mailbag, rip it right

02:20:18.200 --> 02:20:22.240
open and pull out some of her favorite emails. I'm reading them for you right now. I would

02:20:22.240 --> 02:20:27.240
be happy to, but my window that had all the emails on it actually just, uh, completely

02:20:27.240 --> 02:20:31.100
vanished. I have to reopen. Can you reopen it real quick? Okay. Cause I got to tally

02:20:31.100 --> 02:20:37.520
the cage match votes here or yeah, sorry. Listless votes. I'm pulling it back up. Okay.

02:20:37.520 --> 02:20:41.680
Hold your, keep your pants on to do. I don't want dead air. Look, Loki, what are you watching

02:20:41.680 --> 02:20:45.820
over there? Here we go. I've got the first one. I'm watching a violent video of someone

02:20:45.820 --> 02:20:52.560
making levels in a worry where a DIY like blowing someone in half. Uh, here's another

02:20:52.560 --> 02:20:59.720
one there. I'm shooting them. Yeah. Shooting with rainbow farts, sniper rifle. This is

02:20:59.720 --> 02:21:04.340
from cheeseburger. Yay. Hey, as you may or may not know, I've been saving up for gaming

02:21:04.340 --> 02:21:09.800
PC for a year now. I finally got the money just this morning and I spent 1300 at new

02:21:09.800 --> 02:21:13.960
egg. This PC will be good enough to run almost any game on your highest settings. The only

02:21:13.960 --> 02:21:18.600
games I have right now, a world of Warcraft addict and command and conquer three and a

02:21:18.600 --> 02:21:24.280
few hours and hoping to win an eBay auction of crisis. My question is, do you have any

02:21:24.280 --> 02:21:28.600
recommendations for games I should get when the game was released? It was no matter just

02:21:28.600 --> 02:21:37.720
that they're good games. I suggest loom. Um, Star Trek online. I don't know. Some of the

02:21:37.720 --> 02:21:43.040
like Borderlands is pretty cool if you don't have that. He also sends a follow up to the

02:21:43.040 --> 02:21:47.080
email. Forgot to mention in my last email yesterday, my friend had a 16th birthday party

02:21:47.080 --> 02:21:50.800
at John's incredible pizza. I know what a place for that. And I was wondering why have

02:21:50.800 --> 02:21:53.720
you given it the title Johnson, incredibly shitty pizza. Wait, wait, we have somebody

02:21:53.720 --> 02:21:57.960
here local that been to John's incredibly shitty pizza because those are only in Norcal

02:21:57.960 --> 02:22:02.400
as far as I know, unless they really grew over grew fast. Well, did you eat the pizza

02:22:02.400 --> 02:22:06.360
when you were there? It's kind of shitty and it's been sitting out for a long time and

02:22:06.360 --> 02:22:10.920
little kids put their hands all over it and all that stuff. No, the place is okay. I mean,

02:22:10.920 --> 02:22:14.880
actually I gotta say it was really cool cause one of the workers there once like recognize

02:22:14.880 --> 02:22:18.800
this. I don't know how, but they did. And I thought that was really awesome. So Dan

02:22:18.800 --> 02:22:23.040
was there too. Exactly. So, uh, you know, no, they're, they're fine. I have nothing

02:22:23.040 --> 02:22:26.520
against John's incredible pizza, but it's a fun, you gotta admit pretty fun. The pizza

02:22:26.520 --> 02:22:32.360
was pretty suck. All right, there you go. All right. Um, from Robert M from my last

02:22:32.360 --> 02:22:36.960
email a month or two ago, I tried to be clever and use a reference to the spam filters used

02:22:36.960 --> 02:22:40.520
on your forums discussion on the show. So my email was most likely lost to the spam

02:22:40.520 --> 02:22:45.800
filters. Sorry about that. My question now is how long are the animations for the summons

02:22:45.800 --> 02:22:50.240
for final fantasy 13 and can they be skipped? My brother back in the day generally enjoyed

02:22:50.240 --> 02:22:54.240
final fantasy seven but was turned off by the summons taking about what, 10 to 15 seconds

02:22:54.240 --> 02:22:58.840
every time, which can actually add up to get repetitive over the course of your typical

02:22:58.840 --> 02:23:05.800
40 hour JRPG lifespan. Rob. Sorry, I'm focusing on tallying votes. What was the question?

02:23:05.800 --> 02:23:11.760
I haven't seen it. How long are the, are the, are the, we have a shit ton of votes tonight.

02:23:11.760 --> 02:23:16.240
How long are the summons scenes? Not very long. And no, I don't think you can, but they're

02:23:16.240 --> 02:23:21.160
not very long. No, you can skip them. You can't get, Oh, okay. I wish you could skip

02:23:21.160 --> 02:23:25.040
nights of the round. Seriously. When I would do nights of the round on quadra magic and

02:23:25.040 --> 02:23:33.280
then mimic I had time to go make a sandwich, face myself a drink, come back, how that when

02:23:33.280 --> 02:23:37.000
square heard all of the complaints about nights of the round for seven and they're like, how

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:40.920
can we get around this for eight? They're like, Oh, I know. Let's make it so where you

02:23:40.920 --> 02:23:45.360
have to watch the summit and tap square for the boost. Do you remember that? That was

02:23:45.360 --> 02:23:52.280
their answer to that to make you watch it with the power up. Yeah, that was funny. Next

02:23:52.280 --> 02:23:57.480
up, that's all part of the reason why I hated eight. Just so you know, this person didn't

02:23:57.480 --> 02:24:02.480
sign it, so I'm just going to say person who didn't sign their email. Um, have been wondering,

02:24:02.480 --> 02:24:06.120
have been enjoying the, or maybe I'll just use the first part of their email. Sepwin,

02:24:06.120 --> 02:24:09.800
I guess. Um, I have been enjoying the show for a while. One comment about Microsoft's

02:24:09.800 --> 02:24:14.800
project Natal. You mentioned one thing they showed were racing games. As someone who's

02:24:14.800 --> 02:24:20.840
gotten heavy into sim racing games, I think that wouldn't work well even for arcade racers.

02:24:20.840 --> 02:24:24.500
Main reason is there would be no rumble or force feedback to the player. For any racing

02:24:24.500 --> 02:24:28.160
game that isn't meant to be a total arcade experience, a wheel with feedback, preferably

02:24:28.160 --> 02:24:32.960
force feedback is critical. I would argue even burnout games need some sort of tactile

02:24:32.960 --> 02:24:38.360
response to the player. Best wishes. I agree, actually. That's what I kind of like. Like,

02:24:38.360 --> 02:24:46.480
what was it that, um, Rush had really crazy feedback? And it actually made it really fun

02:24:46.480 --> 02:24:54.160
to play, I thought. You know, added a much bigger level into the control. Anyway, last

02:24:54.160 --> 02:25:02.160
email. Um, subject, Rogue Kitty. Okay. All be aware President Katt has gone rogue. He

02:25:02.160 --> 02:25:11.760
shall forever be known as Dictator Katt. Mwahahaha. Snow villagers. Okay. I guess. Oh, it came

02:25:11.760 --> 02:25:23.280
with a picture. Oh, pfft. Hahahaha. War on string may be unwinnable, says General Katt.

02:25:23.280 --> 02:25:30.360
That's funny. I'm gonna save the picture. I'll upload it somewhere. Perhaps our photo

02:25:30.360 --> 02:25:39.760
thing. Perhaps. Anyway, that's the last of it. Ah, I'm not done telling votes yet, but

02:25:39.760 --> 02:25:44.200
we have some more news to get to, right? Or no, we got the FUs of the week. Some angst.

02:25:44.200 --> 02:25:48.080
Every week we like to take a little bit of our time out and get some angst out and some

02:25:48.080 --> 02:25:52.040
anger. And hopefully there's enough of it tonight to, uh, get me through the rest of

02:25:52.040 --> 02:25:56.280
the cage match votes. I keep saying cage match. Listless votes. Alright, uh, let's get to

02:25:56.280 --> 02:26:21.960
the FUs of the week, boys and girls. Um, FU to my digestion. Really. That's it. Loki.

02:26:21.960 --> 02:26:31.920
Um, I'm gonna have to say FU to, um, I don't really know. I don't have anything. I guess

02:26:31.920 --> 02:26:39.640
the lawn being too long. I don't know. Uh, Alan, do you have an FU this week? FUs to

02:26:39.640 --> 02:26:48.440
unemployment. Um, my FU goes to, um, all the boxes on my kitchen table. That's my FU of

02:26:48.440 --> 02:26:52.760
the week. Alright. Uh, usually I would be doing the listless results right now, but

02:26:52.760 --> 02:26:57.080
I'm not ready. We had so many tonight that I'm not ready. This is where I had it in our,

02:26:57.080 --> 02:27:00.400
our list, but I'll have to jump in later. So, uh, Loki, would you do another story for

02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:03.780
us please? By the way, we will be opening the Skype line in just a little bit, but we

02:27:03.780 --> 02:27:09.480
have an interview with our friend Aaron in just a moment. So, uh, stay tuned. Yes. Um,

02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:17.720
apparently bungee has reregistered or registered new trademarks for marathon and bungee aerospace.

02:27:17.720 --> 02:27:23.760
Well marathon of course is their first FPS that they released way back in the day. Um,

02:27:23.760 --> 02:27:29.560
so perhaps a new game in that series. Um, bungee aerospace, not exactly sure what the

02:27:29.560 --> 02:27:37.640
hell that's about, but, um, it's interesting. They do have a logo though for bungee aerospace.

02:27:37.640 --> 02:27:43.880
Perhaps, um, they're seeing a rebranding of the, of a studio or maybe they're gonna make

02:27:43.880 --> 02:27:51.920
spaceships now. Who knows? Is this some type of like further halo thing or does this give

02:27:51.920 --> 02:27:56.440
us some type of idea what they're actually going to be doing after halo? Not really.

02:27:56.440 --> 02:28:01.400
Other than it being a trademark, I mean, obviously I would imagine marathon is going to be coming

02:28:01.400 --> 02:28:06.040
at some point. Didn't they release marathon on Xbox live arcade and I don't remember it

02:28:06.040 --> 02:28:11.600
being very good. I don't remember marathon. No, they did. They did. Yeah, it was, well,

02:28:11.600 --> 02:28:22.120
you know, it was an old game. Whatever. Hmm. Would you mind doing the next story too? Cause

02:28:22.120 --> 02:28:25.520
I'm still, I am still trying to tally votes. That's how many people we had voting tonight.

02:28:25.520 --> 02:28:32.920
Throw in a beta code and that's what we got. Okay. Um, apparently the counter 64 is making

02:28:32.920 --> 02:28:43.080
a return. Yes. Um, the, uh, a brand new, I guess, uh, a keyboard. Um, it looks like it's

02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:52.560
all inclusive in this like keyboard. Um, based on they're saying the cybernet, uh, ZPC GX

02:28:52.560 --> 02:29:02.120
31 and um, it's kinda cool looking a little futuristic thing. It's got a, I think a lot

02:29:02.120 --> 02:29:06.320
of those pictures, I'm finally done. Sorry. I think a lot of those pictures were prototypes.

02:29:06.320 --> 02:29:10.520
Like they're not the actual thing, especially like that one where you see the old ass system

02:29:10.520 --> 02:29:16.160
running windows 95 or windows XP is, yeah, obviously a little bit silly, but dude, I'm

02:29:16.160 --> 02:29:20.960
all about the counter 64 making a comeback cause there was some, that was like, I, again,

02:29:20.960 --> 02:29:23.800
I'm hoping it's not something that I view in a greater light because it was when I was

02:29:23.800 --> 02:29:27.440
young, but there were just some awesome programs on the 64 and I love the fact, here's the

02:29:27.440 --> 02:29:32.240
number one reason the 64 was awesome. You could hook it up to your TV. That's why, that's

02:29:32.240 --> 02:29:35.360
why I won the computer wars. I'm telling you, at least back in the eighties, the personal

02:29:35.360 --> 02:29:42.480
computer wars before the IBM's. So that's kind of neat. All right. I'm finally ready.

02:29:42.480 --> 02:29:45.840
By the way, if they re if they released a new Commodore 64, what do you think they should

02:29:45.840 --> 02:29:53.400
put on it? I don't know. A bagel, a bunch of music making software would be good. Mario

02:29:53.400 --> 02:29:59.920
paint put this way though, the counter 64 probably have more applications than an Apple

02:29:59.920 --> 02:30:05.800
PC or an Apple home computer. Hopefully it would be backwards compatible. So let's get

02:30:05.800 --> 02:30:14.440
to the list list results tonight. We're going to do the list list results. Play the music.

02:30:14.440 --> 02:30:19.600
You voted in here. It is the definitive list of the ideas that Microsoft should steal and

02:30:19.600 --> 02:30:24.200
make better. Here's your top three, by the way, just narrowly missing the list tonight

02:30:24.200 --> 02:30:28.920
by one vote. Jesus, Jesus did not make the list. All right, but we have your top three

02:30:28.920 --> 02:30:33.000
answers. We have a tie for third place, a tie for the number three thing you most want

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:36.800
to see Microsoft improve on. By the way, this is it. There is no arguing. This is a very

02:30:36.800 --> 02:30:43.360
scientific process. Microsoft, if you're listening, here it is. Number three, the masses want

02:30:43.360 --> 02:30:49.680
Pokemans. They want you to take the Pokemans and make them better and tied with that. You

02:30:49.680 --> 02:30:53.800
might have to fry those Pokemans and the Colonel's secret recipe because you got to make that

02:30:53.800 --> 02:31:00.260
better too. The Colonel's recipe and Pokemans tying for third place tonight. Second place

02:31:00.260 --> 02:31:07.000
tonight, visual memory cards is what they want you to steal and make better. VMUs you

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:12.960
take those and make them better. And lastly, the number one thing that Microsoft needs

02:31:12.960 --> 02:31:20.880
to steal and make better, the PSP, a handheld system. That's right, Microsoft. We want a

02:31:20.880 --> 02:31:25.600
handheld system as voted by our chatters. That's it. No arguing. We're done. Windows

02:31:25.600 --> 02:31:30.960
mobile, not going to cut it. You need to steal the PSP and make it better. There are two

02:31:30.960 --> 02:31:37.080
parts to this tonight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12

02:31:37.080 --> 02:31:42.340
people want the beta. Oh no, 11 people want the beta code. Alan, pick a number between

02:31:42.340 --> 02:31:50.960
one and 11. If you wouldn't mind. Four, four, one, two, three, four. Congratulations. Llama

02:31:50.960 --> 02:31:56.880
juice wins one of our beta codes tonight. So we'll be sending him a beta code in a moment.

02:31:56.880 --> 02:32:01.840
And um, let's see, pick a number between one and 11. That's not for dark Sakura. Pick a

02:32:01.840 --> 02:32:06.960
number between one and 11. That's not four, eight, eight, one, two, three, four, five,

02:32:06.960 --> 02:32:14.360
six, seven, eight. Amaze Satsuma wins a blur beta code. So congratulations to you guys.

02:32:14.360 --> 02:32:19.640
Sorry to everyone else, but there it is. So llama juice and Amaze Satsuma win beta codes

02:32:19.640 --> 02:32:24.360
just for voting and participating in the show tonight. You can too, Sunday nights at six

02:32:24.360 --> 02:32:31.520
o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right at all games, radio, all games.com. All right.

02:32:31.520 --> 02:32:38.680
We're going to get to the Skypline in a minute, although I was hoping to speak to Aaron, but

02:32:38.680 --> 02:32:49.200
I closed the number with his phone number. When I was telling all the votes, I closed

02:32:49.200 --> 02:32:54.840
the window, um, with his number. So now I'm waiting for it. Um, so there it is. So also

02:32:54.840 --> 02:32:58.640
I need to send those codes. So I'm going to send those codes. Loki, do you have any quick

02:32:58.640 --> 02:33:02.720
last minute stories to work in here while I wait to hopefully hear from Aaron?

02:33:02.720 --> 02:33:09.160
Uh, Alan Wake, several download content episodes are due out this year. Uh, second season possibly

02:33:09.160 --> 02:33:16.160
available depending on the audience. Um, I don't know if they buy it or not or how well

02:33:16.160 --> 02:33:20.640
the first season does. That's kind of neat. Kind of reminds me of what they're doing with

02:33:20.640 --> 02:33:24.520
a heavy rain. They're going to be releasing some demo content seasons for that. And of

02:33:24.520 --> 02:33:34.720
course the game is, uh, set to hit shelves on May 18th on the Xbox 360. Uh, let's see

02:33:34.720 --> 02:33:43.040
here. There, I don't know what they're doing with this, but, uh, their casting apparently

02:33:43.040 --> 02:33:50.320
has been, um, released for the Kane and Lynch film and Kane, um, pretty cool. They're going

02:33:50.320 --> 02:33:57.680
to have, uh, Bruce Willis to play, uh, Kane Lynch, however, is being played by Jamie Foxx,

02:33:57.680 --> 02:34:06.720
who I might add looks absolutely nothing like the character of Lynch. Nothing. If you think

02:34:06.720 --> 02:34:12.720
about it, not the be all racist or anything, but a black man playing the character named

02:34:12.720 --> 02:34:20.160
Lynch is a little weird. If you ask me. Wow. Wow. I have no response for that at all. I'm

02:34:20.160 --> 02:34:25.480
just saying. Okay. But seriously though, Jamie Foxx, great actor, but he looks nothing like

02:34:25.480 --> 02:34:29.840
the character. Billy Bob Thornton looks more like the character. I think of course he's

02:34:29.840 --> 02:34:34.520
a horrible actor. Well, at least now he's a horrible actor. Well, I think, you know,

02:34:34.520 --> 02:34:38.120
with makeup and so forth, they'll give him the mullet and the glasses and everything

02:34:38.120 --> 02:34:45.040
he needs. Look weird in the mulling glasses. I mean, he's, it's a different race. It's

02:34:45.040 --> 02:34:50.840
like as bad as the whole Chung Lee thing in the last street fighter movie. Not Asian.

02:34:50.840 --> 02:34:55.840
Doesn't look anything like Chung Lee. Oh, and can act. By the way, bonds as double oh

02:34:55.840 --> 02:35:02.880
six in chat says I am black myself and I say no. And into what Loki said, yes, yes, yes.

02:35:02.880 --> 02:35:08.160
Same thing ran through my head. WTF. So maybe Loki is not as insensitive as real time. I

02:35:08.160 --> 02:35:12.840
see the Prince of Persia trailer with Jake Gyllenhaal in the movie theater. Every time

02:35:12.840 --> 02:35:18.240
I see that trailer, I just want to scream out, he's white, like to the theater. Just,

02:35:18.240 --> 02:35:24.040
yeah, you should. I have to add, this is completely off topic here, but they finally released

02:35:24.040 --> 02:35:29.920
the riff tracks for the new Twilight movie. I am very excited to watch that. Not that

02:35:29.920 --> 02:35:33.880
I'm excited to watch the Twilight movies, but the riff tracks were fucking hilarious

02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:39.280
and we watched it with the happening. Oh my God. Completely different movie watching that

02:35:39.280 --> 02:35:48.760
is just ridiculously funny. No phone number yet. No, I got it. I got it. I'm sorry. I

02:35:48.760 --> 02:35:52.120
was just waiting for the conversation to finish because a good times. I like it when you say

02:35:52.120 --> 02:35:55.720
things will get you in trouble. All right, so we're going to give our good buddy Aaron

02:35:55.720 --> 02:36:01.120
also known as Y Y R a call because he's has a brand new game on the Xbox live marketplace

02:36:01.120 --> 02:36:04.880
and the indie game section and we want to talk to him about it. So let's get him on

02:36:04.880 --> 02:36:09.640
the line. We're going to call him on our Skype line right now and then we'll open up the

02:36:09.640 --> 02:36:15.040
Skype line for anybody to call in at one eight seven seven. Hello. Hey Aaron, how you doing?

02:36:15.040 --> 02:36:19.280
I figured it was you. Hey, how'd you know? It wasn't just the whole back and forth about

02:36:19.280 --> 02:36:23.400
he ran off to get a drink at just the wrong moment. How you doing Aaron? Congratulations.

02:36:23.400 --> 02:36:29.280
You released a game tonight. I am. I'm doing okay, which is pretty, pretty cool considering

02:36:29.280 --> 02:36:35.520
this has been a bumpy ride. Um, you know, losing power from west Saturday night through

02:36:35.520 --> 02:36:40.800
this Thursday evening and basically shacking up with my parents and doing all that I could

02:36:40.800 --> 02:36:45.200
from there. I'm working on convention crap for most of the weekend and now I think I'm

02:36:45.200 --> 02:36:50.720
coming down with a cold. Oh goody. Now that's right. You're going to be at PAX east, right?

02:36:50.720 --> 02:36:55.840
Now you're showing off a snake 360 in your latest game in at a booth there. I'm going

02:36:55.840 --> 02:37:01.840
to have all, um, I'm going to have all four of my, my games. Um, three of them will have

02:37:01.840 --> 02:37:06.920
been released up to that point. And the fourth I thought would probably have been released,

02:37:06.920 --> 02:37:13.560
but um, it's failed review on a technicality. So, um, it'll be coming next month and of

02:37:13.560 --> 02:37:18.000
course anyone at PAX East is going to be able to try it first. So that's kind of pretty

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:22.920
cool. So I'm going to turn it from a, well, it should have been out into a, it's coming

02:37:22.920 --> 02:37:27.960
soon and you get to play it first. How cool is that? Hey, there you go. Hey, that's some,

02:37:27.960 --> 02:37:31.360
some reason why people want to go to PAX is to play the games first. And by the way, Ziba

02:37:31.360 --> 02:37:35.360
in our chat room is suggesting take some airborne, but as the 200 Matt says, it doesn't work.

02:37:35.360 --> 02:37:39.960
So all right, well let's, let's talk about your latest game. So tonight on Xbox live

02:37:39.960 --> 02:37:43.800
marketplace, you released a game called falling and we have a little clip so you can hear

02:37:43.800 --> 02:37:53.280
some of the music. Now, as you can probably tell, this game is very retro inspired. In

02:37:53.280 --> 02:37:58.400
fact, when I first looked at it, I was like, is this like a remake of pango or something?

02:37:58.400 --> 02:38:01.760
But no, this just because the little guys look like penguins and they're moving around

02:38:01.760 --> 02:38:06.640
blocks. This is something very different. I can tell, tell us a little bit about falling.

02:38:06.640 --> 02:38:13.300
Well, um, basically what it kind of is, is it's a puzzle type game at its core. Um, what

02:38:13.300 --> 02:38:17.280
you do is you're, you're playing the part of the penguin right there. Peppy, the penguin,

02:38:17.280 --> 02:38:21.840
that's his name. And uh, you're running around and blocks are falling from the ceiling because

02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:30.200
Wally the walrus is trying to get into your house. Okay. Damn that walrus. So what you

02:38:30.200 --> 02:38:35.000
need to do is clean up the mess and then crush Wally before he causes trouble, which of course

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:40.960
is touching you. You die. But you know, at first also Wally starts off stupid. He just

02:38:40.960 --> 02:38:44.600
kind of walks back and forth and waits for you to crush him either by pushing a block

02:38:44.600 --> 02:38:50.280
on him or, you know, um, dropping it on his head or whatever. But then later on he can

02:38:50.280 --> 02:38:56.040
push blocks around, he can jump over things, he can kick blocks at your face, you know,

02:38:56.040 --> 02:39:00.360
just generally make life miserable for you. So, you know, you gotta get rid of him and

02:39:00.360 --> 02:39:04.080
you also have to clear the blocks by throwing or kicking the same colored blocks into each

02:39:04.080 --> 02:39:11.680
other. So, you know, you're matching colors, you're avoiding walking walruses and, you

02:39:11.680 --> 02:39:16.280
know, just generally things get pretty chaotic later in the game and it's fun. It's got the

02:39:16.280 --> 02:39:22.880
retro vibe and, you know, it plays a lot like a frenetic arcade experience, you know. I

02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:27.160
like to compare it to, you know, something like Bubble Bobble where it starts off simple

02:39:27.160 --> 02:39:32.440
and then it just, it gets very complex and very action packed and, you know, it, I feel

02:39:32.440 --> 02:39:39.400
it does have the kind of lasting enjoyment that a game like that, you know, used to have.

02:39:39.400 --> 02:39:43.720
I think I pretty much captured that spirit. It definitely looks like something that could

02:39:43.720 --> 02:39:49.080
be from Game Room. It's kind of that old kind of retro look to it. It seems like this game

02:39:49.080 --> 02:39:54.560
is coming out just in time, honestly, for everything. So. Yeah, well, I mean, I hope

02:39:54.560 --> 02:39:59.040
people download it and they, you know, they get the same kind of feelings that they get

02:39:59.040 --> 02:40:05.000
when they play one of their favorite old games and then I hope they buy it. So you can't

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.920
get the trial in the marketplace right now. I'm going to go ahead and let the, oh, you

02:40:07.920 --> 02:40:11.520
have several videos up here on YouTube, don't you? You have like an attract mode, some other

02:40:11.520 --> 02:40:16.200
gameplay clips. Let's try one of these other clips here on the YouTube. Now you posted

02:40:16.200 --> 02:40:20.280
some clips of the game. This is round 10. We're going to look at analysis as I'm imagining

02:40:20.280 --> 02:40:24.120
things get a little more intense in this level, the bricks fall faster. Actually, I was playing

02:40:24.120 --> 02:40:29.080
on hard difficulty when I made that video, so it's kind of nuts. I don't think, I think

02:40:29.080 --> 02:40:34.160
that video ends with my death actually. Now there's multiple, there's walrai, there's

02:40:34.160 --> 02:40:40.600
multiple walruses. Oh yeah, they come in packs. Oh my gosh. They're like real walruses. Actually,

02:40:40.600 --> 02:40:44.520
I'm not basing that statement on any fact whatsoever. Okay, I've got to ask you, this

02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:49.120
seems like the most obvious question. Where did the inspiration for a game like this come

02:40:49.120 --> 02:40:53.760
from? Where did this come to you in like a dream or something? Like dude's going to,

02:40:53.760 --> 02:40:57.600
penguin's going to get his home invaded by walruses. Like where the hell did you come

02:40:57.600 --> 02:41:05.040
up with this? Well, to be completely honest, um, the, the entire concept for the game started

02:41:05.040 --> 02:41:13.040
with my, I guess now ex-fiancee's, um, you know, obsession with Piplup. That is, that

02:41:13.040 --> 02:41:19.160
is completely true. And I wanted to make a game with a penguin in it and I thought, okay,

02:41:19.160 --> 02:41:22.760
blocks are falling from the ceiling. And then I thought, okay, something has to come and

02:41:22.760 --> 02:41:27.240
be an antagonist. And then, you know, I figured, well, you know, I think I heard somewhere

02:41:27.240 --> 02:41:32.840
that walruses in real life don't like penguins. So I started going with that. And then when

02:41:32.840 --> 02:41:38.080
I had already drawn all the sprites, I decided to actually look this up. And according to

02:41:38.080 --> 02:41:43.480
stuff I found on Wikipedia, the simple fact of the matter is due to differences in their

02:41:43.480 --> 02:41:49.160
habitats, walruses and penguins in real life basically never see each other. So I went

02:41:49.160 --> 02:41:53.000
with it anyway. So you found out that walruses and penguins were like mortal enemies and

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:58.240
you're like, there's a game there. Yes, yes, exactly. Now I'm looking at this, you have

02:41:58.240 --> 02:42:01.520
another video on YouTube and you can see these videos by the way, uh, listeners by going

02:42:01.520 --> 02:42:08.520
to the website for Aaron's games. It's yyrgames.com. That's all one word, yyrgames.com. And I'm

02:42:08.520 --> 02:42:12.200
looking at kind of like the attract mode that shows you how to play the game, but I noticed

02:42:12.200 --> 02:42:17.160
you have it set up. Like it looks like you're playing a ROM and MAME or something. Is that,

02:42:17.160 --> 02:42:21.000
what made you decide to go for that? That's exactly what I was going for. Is there a reason

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:25.040
for that? You were just like, I want to make my game feel like a MAME ROM or you know,

02:42:25.040 --> 02:42:29.560
you just wanted to kind of enhance that retro vibe this game has going for it or what? I

02:42:29.560 --> 02:42:33.360
totally just basically wanted to make it feel like an old arcade game. From the moment you

02:42:33.360 --> 02:42:37.640
power up the machine and you see the ROM test and you know, it puts the option settings

02:42:37.640 --> 02:42:43.200
on the screen for a fraction of a second to going into the options and being able to adjust

02:42:43.200 --> 02:42:49.960
how many coins the game costs. You know, it's all in there. Nice. But no real coins. It's

02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:53.320
much different than game room where game room charges you 50 cents a play, but that won't

02:42:53.320 --> 02:42:59.600
happen here, right? No, no. You can try it for free, just like all indie games. And uh,

02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:04.920
if you spend 80 space bucks, just 80 space bucks, you can play it as much as you want

02:43:04.920 --> 02:43:12.640
for as long as you want. I think I caught, how many space bucks was that? 80. $1. $1?

02:43:12.640 --> 02:43:16.000
That's a steal. That's great. Now what is this? I noticed, I just caught this briefly

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:20.420
at the end of the attract screen here, that when it's showing the high score table, it

02:43:20.420 --> 02:43:29.200
looks like the default scores say import Futari now. What is that? Oh, nothing. No, that's

02:43:29.200 --> 02:43:36.280
a direct reference to Mushihime from off Futari, the cave shooting game released last year.

02:43:36.280 --> 02:43:40.600
Actually there's another game that I'm releasing soon called Sharpshooter and I make a reference

02:43:40.600 --> 02:43:46.720
to DJ Max Technica and its high score tables. I'm all about referencing other games, other

02:43:46.720 --> 02:43:54.000
stuff. In fact, before we end this conversation, I would like to actually directly reference

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:58.200
one of the in-game references that I have actually in all my games and I'm turning that

02:43:58.200 --> 02:44:06.460
into a giveaway for three of our chat rumors. Okay. So what, the chatters have to know what

02:44:06.460 --> 02:44:10.800
it is that all your games have in common or what? What's the deal? Well, do you want to

02:44:10.800 --> 02:44:20.600
do it now? Sure. Why not? Okay. Well, in every game that I've released so far, Snake 360,

02:44:20.600 --> 02:44:25.800
Card Arcade, Falling, and also in the game that I'm releasing next month, Sharpshooter,

02:44:25.800 --> 02:44:29.640
and by the way, all those games will be on display at PAX East and I hope that everyone

02:44:29.640 --> 02:44:34.320
who comes to PAX East will come to our booth and have a really great time. I'm going to

02:44:34.320 --> 02:44:39.120
be next to Mommy's Best Games and they're going to have a bunch of great stuff too including

02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:45.200
an unreleased game called Grapple Buggy. So, you know, come, play the games. I'm going

02:44:45.200 --> 02:44:51.040
to be running Snake 360 tournaments all weekend long. You can compete for prizes, t-shirts,

02:44:51.040 --> 02:44:57.560
soundtracks, CDs, like I decided to go all out with this. So, but at any rate, no it's

02:44:57.560 --> 02:45:04.560
not O-L-O-R-G related. Thank you, chat. But I will absolutely stop by the booth. Absolutely

02:45:04.560 --> 02:45:09.400
I'll be stopping by to say hello. I am looking forward to meeting you. Absolutely I'll be

02:45:09.400 --> 02:45:12.000
by. I don't know what I'm wearing yet. Everybody's asking me what are you wearing so I can like

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:18.360
see, spot you and see you. I don't know. I was hoping to have my frilly orange scarf

02:45:18.360 --> 02:45:22.520
but it looks like I'll have to save that for PAX Prime. I have this thing called homework.

02:45:22.520 --> 02:45:26.560
I know. I know. Bakers can't be choosers. But I'll find something creative. Well, I

02:45:26.560 --> 02:45:30.200
know, I know my friend Amanda plans to wear a corset one day so I was thinking well I

02:45:30.200 --> 02:45:34.200
could wear a corset. But I don't know how well that would go over. So, we'll have to

02:45:34.200 --> 02:45:39.440
see. I'll, stay tuned to the Twitter folks. I'll let you know. Alright, but anyway, back

02:45:39.440 --> 02:45:47.440
to the giveaway. Yes. So, in all of the games that I'm, that I have released or am releasing,

02:45:47.440 --> 02:45:52.520
I have a number in there. It's usually in the form of in one of the high score numbers

02:45:52.520 --> 02:45:57.520
and it's a direct reference to a video game company. The first three people to type it

02:45:57.520 --> 02:46:05.320
into chat get a code to download falling for free. Woo hoo. Free falling. Save, save that

02:46:05.320 --> 02:46:10.920
dollar by typing that number into chat right now. So, and. Not the number. I don't need

02:46:10.920 --> 02:46:15.160
the number. I need the video game company that I reference. Oops, my bad. It's not Konami.

02:46:15.160 --> 02:46:20.800
My bad. The video game company he references and he flat out has told you it is not Konami.

02:46:20.800 --> 02:46:26.200
So, go ahead and guess. There it is. And you know what? And you know what? If, yeah, I'm

02:46:26.200 --> 02:46:32.760
not seeing it yet, so I'm just gonna say what the number is. Okay. It's 765. I'm trying

02:46:32.760 --> 02:46:38.160
to think what that reference is. It's gotta be like a. 765. It's gotta be, it's probably

02:46:38.160 --> 02:46:45.480
very similar to the whole 573 thing. It's. It's not Konami. It's not Bungie. Me, me.

02:46:45.480 --> 02:46:52.360
I see it. I'm waiting for two other people to say it before I confirm it. What, what's

02:46:52.360 --> 02:46:58.200
the list of what it's not? It's not Konami. And the number is 765. Okay, three people

02:46:58.200 --> 02:47:02.800
wrote Namco. We're done. Oh, Namco. Tell us a little more about the reference to Namco.

02:47:02.800 --> 02:47:11.040
Yes, I am basically a Namco fangirl. Uh huh. So many of Namco's games are on my all time

02:47:11.040 --> 02:47:17.280
list of favorites that I couldn't possibly not be a Namco fangirl. So I'm basically referencing

02:47:17.280 --> 02:47:23.360
them in, well, everything. Nice. And you know what? Hey, hey, I will say this. I, you know,

02:47:23.360 --> 02:47:27.480
we've, we've had our creative differences with Namco in the past. I'll just leave it

02:47:27.480 --> 02:47:33.000
that way. But I will say this. This made me a giddy little fangirl as well is that in,

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:36.580
and I apologize for the listeners that have heard this story 5,000 times, but you know

02:47:36.580 --> 02:47:43.320
I love this story. In the Namco PS3 game, the Namco Treasures Volume 1, there is a direct

02:47:43.320 --> 02:47:48.560
OLR reference like in your face. It, it, when you go in, yes, when you go into the game,

02:47:48.560 --> 02:47:51.720
it's, and it has to be the full version. It doesn't work in the demo. So you have to buy

02:47:51.720 --> 02:47:56.820
the full version. But when you go in, there's a splash screen that shows like a sample cause

02:47:56.820 --> 02:48:00.720
it's just showing off the new online features and there's a demo high score table and like

02:48:00.720 --> 02:48:05.560
friends list and you see OLR in the high score table and then the person's friends list is

02:48:05.560 --> 02:48:10.680
Sky, Dark Soccer, and Loki. Oh wow, I gotta go run and check that right now. No kitty,

02:48:10.680 --> 02:48:15.080
it's on the PS3 and it's the Namco Treasures Volume 1. It's the one that has like Pac-Man

02:48:15.080 --> 02:48:18.720
and, and all that stuff. I think I actually downloaded that. I, I don't know if I still

02:48:18.720 --> 02:48:22.360
have it on the hard drive, but it's not. I'm getting it again. But it's not in the demo.

02:48:22.360 --> 02:48:25.040
I just want to make that clear. You will not see it in the demo. That splash screen is

02:48:25.040 --> 02:48:29.560
only in the full version. Cause the way the PS3 works is funky. Your demo is like completely

02:48:29.560 --> 02:48:33.440
separate from your regular game. It's not like the 360 where you upgrade. Yeah, I know.

02:48:33.440 --> 02:48:39.000
I'm not happy about it either. Yeah. So again, if you hadn't heard that story before, I love

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:44.640
that story so much. I totally support that. That's when you know you made it. We've been

02:48:44.640 --> 02:48:49.800
doing this show for eight years to get our name in a video game was amazing. So we were

02:48:49.800 --> 02:48:54.080
very happy about that. Well, Aaron, I want to wish you the best of luck with your release.

02:48:54.080 --> 02:48:58.720
And again, if our chatters want to stay on top of your releases, Y Y R games.com real

02:48:58.720 --> 02:49:02.880
quick, cause I wanted to ask this at some point, how long does it take you to make these

02:49:02.880 --> 02:49:08.520
games? Give us an idea. How long did falling take? Start to finish. I started falling.

02:49:08.520 --> 02:49:16.640
I'd say probably around September or October of last year. And now granted I was working

02:49:16.640 --> 02:49:21.600
on sharpshooter, which is my release for next month at the same time. And by the way, if

02:49:21.600 --> 02:49:26.000
you're developing a game, I would very, very strongly recommend that you never, ever try

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:31.520
to work on two at the same time, because as with most things, it'll probably wind up taking

02:49:31.520 --> 02:49:36.440
you longer, you know, to finish both than if you just did one and then the other. But

02:49:36.440 --> 02:49:41.640
yeah, it, it does take a while because you know, it's, you could have a basic version

02:49:41.640 --> 02:49:45.720
of the game up and running very quickly, but if you really want to polish it, if you want

02:49:45.720 --> 02:49:49.960
to, you know, take the time to work out all the kinks, if you want to have great sound

02:49:49.960 --> 02:49:56.560
effects, music, graphics, every, every bit of it needs time spent on it. So, you know,

02:49:56.560 --> 02:50:02.960
if you really, really have to spend a whole lot of time and effort on it. So, you know,

02:50:02.960 --> 02:50:07.120
one thing I say to people, people really just don't realize how much time goes into a game.

02:50:07.120 --> 02:50:11.400
The next time you're walking through a 3d environment and a first person shooter, you

02:50:11.400 --> 02:50:18.720
know, don't just run past that, that intricately designed building and never look at it again.

02:50:18.720 --> 02:50:23.280
You know, actually take the time to look at it and admire what, you know, a bunch of designers

02:50:23.280 --> 02:50:29.440
worked on because they spent hours on that and we run past it in five seconds. It's amazing

02:50:29.440 --> 02:50:33.440
all the detail that goes into that type of work. It's kind of like a movie. There's,

02:50:33.440 --> 02:50:36.640
you know, the list of credits at the end of the movie, it really does take that many people

02:50:36.640 --> 02:50:44.080
to make a movie, but this game falling was made by one guy, right? There it is. Well,

02:50:44.080 --> 02:50:48.800
Aaron, good luck. I hope your hard work pays off guys. If you have the dollar, just go,

02:50:48.800 --> 02:50:53.760
go spend the dollar, go support some indie gamers, go check it out on the Xbox live indie

02:50:53.760 --> 02:50:58.760
marketplace falling snake three lucky winners. Watch your PMs. All right. And if you want

02:50:58.760 --> 02:51:04.440
to follow Aaron, the website, yyrgames.com congrats on the release, Aaron. And, uh, I

02:51:04.440 --> 02:51:09.440
hope you make some money. Oh, uh, I'm, I'm just looking to get my name out there and

02:51:09.440 --> 02:51:14.960
maybe make enough to someday do this for a living. I'm not looking to make a fortune

02:51:14.960 --> 02:51:19.520
or anything. Sounds, that sounds like a fair compromise. We'll see you at PAX East Aaron.

02:51:19.520 --> 02:51:23.480
All right. You see that? All right. I'll probably be assaulting you with a microphone there

02:51:23.480 --> 02:51:28.160
too. Just so you know. That's just fine. All right. Good luck. See you at the show. See

02:51:28.160 --> 02:51:34.040
you later later. Aaron also known as yyr from yyrgames.com and a yeah, a little reminder

02:51:34.040 --> 02:51:38.840
in our chat room. And, uh, this is also important. Speaking of indie games, uh, Bobby references

02:51:38.840 --> 02:51:43.640
on his show earlier, but, uh, our, um, podcasting friends at a dead pixel live, they're another

02:51:43.640 --> 02:51:48.960
all game show. Uh, the guy there, Derek, he develops indie games too, and he put one out

02:51:48.960 --> 02:51:54.120
not that long ago called you will die. Well, apparently it is now the first Xbox live indie

02:51:54.120 --> 02:51:59.280
game to have an official twin galaxy scoreboard, which I think is kind of interesting. So,

02:51:59.280 --> 02:52:04.240
uh, yeah, that's, that's very cool. So congratulations to Derek on that accomplishment. Who knows?

02:52:04.240 --> 02:52:08.600
Maybe falling being a retro game could, could be next. Who knows? We'll see. I don't know

02:52:08.600 --> 02:52:11.800
if that'll open the flood gates, but, uh, congrats to all of our friends that are indie

02:52:11.800 --> 02:52:15.520
developers, man. That takes, it takes a lot of work. Like I wish I had that kind of talent.

02:52:15.520 --> 02:52:20.180
I would make an OLR game. I think that would be fun, but we'll see. All right. Are we ready

02:52:20.180 --> 02:52:24.680
to go to the phones and take some calls tonight? Why not? I think so. We're only going to take

02:52:24.680 --> 02:52:28.520
a couple of calls tonight, guys. I apologize to those that don't get through tonight. We

02:52:28.520 --> 02:52:34.080
just, uh, we got a lot of show done tonight. So, uh, one eight seven seven game. OLR is

02:52:34.080 --> 02:52:38.160
the number to call or our username on Skype is orange lounge radio. Loki real quick. Did

02:52:38.160 --> 02:52:41.760
you have any other last minute stories before we, um, get to the phones? Yeah, there's this

02:52:41.760 --> 02:52:45.920
new game. It's a new music game coming out called power gig rise of the six string, which

02:52:45.920 --> 02:52:51.160
kind of neat about it is it actually uses a guitar controller that is a real electric

02:52:51.160 --> 02:52:54.880
guitar. You can convert it into, well, you plug in an amp into it and it's a real electric

02:52:54.880 --> 02:52:59.280
guitar, but it will teach you how to play a guitar. By the way, YYR wants to say he

02:52:59.280 --> 02:53:03.640
is running a high score contest on falling and you have to check YYR games.com for more

02:53:03.640 --> 02:53:09.320
details. Our phone lines are like flooded. I'm just going to take a call here and we're

02:53:09.320 --> 02:53:14.080
going to go ahead and go to the phones. Hi, you're on. Whoa. I see webcam. We don't get

02:53:14.080 --> 02:53:19.200
those calls much higher on orange launch radio. Who's this? Howdy. This is llama juice. Hey,

02:53:19.200 --> 02:53:25.000
llama juice. Congrats. You won the blur beta, right? Yes, I did have fun with that. Good

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:29.880
luck with that. All right. Hopefully your video doesn't screw up our, um, bandwidth,

02:53:29.880 --> 02:53:32.680
but we'll see what happens. Oh no, he shut it off. All right. That's all right. What's

02:53:32.680 --> 02:53:37.840
up? What's up llama juice? No, that's okay. It's cool. What's on your mind? I went down

02:53:37.840 --> 02:53:45.800
to a GDC in San Francisco, uh, last week ish. Yeah. And uh, I, I don't know if you guys

02:53:45.800 --> 02:53:50.520
like, I, I, I got to the show late last week, so I didn't get to hear about anything you

02:53:50.520 --> 02:53:53.840
guys were talking about. No, we didn't go to the show, which is funny because we're

02:53:53.840 --> 02:53:57.320
not that, you must be in the area cause we're, we're just in Sacramento, so we're not that

02:53:57.320 --> 02:54:01.880
far from San Francisco. In fact, Alan is from there, so I go there all of the time and I

02:54:01.880 --> 02:54:07.000
was there that weekend. But uh, you know, GDC, they don't really let media people in,

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:12.360
so I didn't go. They actually do have media passes. You, you should, you should try that

02:54:12.360 --> 02:54:16.780
next time. Yeah, but unfortunately it's kind of one of those double edged swords. Indie

02:54:16.780 --> 02:54:23.280
podcasters aren't really a media enough for a them. Fair enough. So you have to work for

02:54:23.280 --> 02:54:29.240
IGN or well, I guess I guess the media passes will be opening up next time. All right. Uh,

02:54:29.240 --> 02:54:34.760
so what, how, how was GDC? What'd you think? Um, the conference itself was really awesome.

02:54:34.760 --> 02:54:41.320
I'm an environment artist trying to try to get a job. So for, to go there, it was basically

02:54:41.320 --> 02:54:46.280
a giant job fair, you know, with all the big companies and whatnot trying to, trying to

02:54:46.280 --> 02:54:54.640
hire people. Um, but what was neat is that like all of the, all of the different, uh,

02:54:54.640 --> 02:55:02.040
like Sony and Microsoft had booths there too showing off all their stuff and uh, Sony was

02:55:02.040 --> 02:55:07.760
showing off their, their PlayStation move. Did you get your hands on it? Yes. Ah, I want

02:55:07.760 --> 02:55:11.920
to know what you thought then. I definitely want to know what you thought of move. Um,

02:55:11.920 --> 02:55:15.840
I was out opening day picking up the week, you know, I was out there waiting outside

02:55:15.840 --> 02:55:24.100
for 14 hours and uh, the, the move puts the weed of shame hands down. Wow. The controls

02:55:24.100 --> 02:55:32.760
for it were extremely responsive. Um, the, the demos that they showed were, it was a

02:55:32.760 --> 02:55:38.840
lot of, um, really, really cheesy stuff. Like there was a little game with where you made

02:55:38.840 --> 02:55:45.920
bubbles and a monkey tried to pop the bubbles. But, uh, as far as like the controlling of

02:55:45.920 --> 02:55:53.400
it all went, it like, it was very one to one, very, very quick and responsive. Is that all

02:55:53.400 --> 02:55:57.540
you played was the monkey bubble game or were there other stuff you got to check out? There

02:55:57.540 --> 02:56:03.080
was the monkey bubble game. There was like the, that tech demo that they showed at E3,

02:56:03.080 --> 02:56:07.760
like right when they showed it off, they had that there. Um, and then they had some other

02:56:07.760 --> 02:56:13.520
game that I watched some girl play where she was like swinging some swords and mallets

02:56:13.520 --> 02:56:19.600
or something around and she was getting really into it and it looked like it was very responsive

02:56:19.600 --> 02:56:27.840
as to what she was doing and, and all that. Um, they were showing that, uh, if you have

02:56:27.840 --> 02:56:33.320
the two controllers, it actually, the camera itself can actually do face tracking as well.

02:56:33.320 --> 02:56:39.880
Oh wow. And so the, the camera can like see your face and the two remotes and then guess

02:56:39.880 --> 02:56:46.560
where your arms are and all that. And so it can do like full bot or it tries to do like,

02:56:46.560 --> 02:56:51.040
um, sensing, you know, where your body is. And so if you're docking and stuff like that,

02:56:51.040 --> 02:56:56.180
it can, it can try to replicate that with a character on screen. Interesting. So it's

02:56:56.180 --> 02:56:59.400
got a little bit of that because that's kind of the stuff that they're selling when the

02:56:59.400 --> 02:57:02.200
tall. So it's interesting to hear that move kind of has a little bit of that built in.

02:57:02.200 --> 02:57:06.640
So I think a lot of us are thinking of it as only a we rip off right now. So to hear

02:57:06.640 --> 02:57:10.400
that it's got a little additional camera features is kind of cool. I will tell you something

02:57:10.400 --> 02:57:13.840
though that when we were talking about this last week, I think one place where we were

02:57:13.840 --> 02:57:19.640
critical of move, although, you know, I think we all see it as a logical step for Sony and

02:57:19.640 --> 02:57:23.920
we all know they've had more time now to perfect the technology. So it better be better. But

02:57:23.920 --> 02:57:28.600
the big question is, does it have the games to substantiate it? Because you know, if it's

02:57:28.600 --> 02:57:33.280
just another bunch of little mini party games and so forth, then what's the point? Do you

02:57:33.280 --> 02:57:38.720
think from what you observed that move has the, let's just go back to the old OLR golden

02:57:38.720 --> 02:57:43.920
rule rule of a video game system is only as good as the games that are on it. Do you think

02:57:43.920 --> 02:57:50.400
that move has the games to substantiate the controller?

02:57:50.400 --> 02:57:55.960
From what they showed at GDC, they really only showed one game, like one full game with

02:57:55.960 --> 02:58:02.320
it. And I didn't really see much of it. But I was talking to the guy that like the main

02:58:02.320 --> 02:58:07.360
main guy behind the whole technology of it all. And he was saying that new SOCOM that's

02:58:07.360 --> 02:58:15.240
going to be coming out is going to be using it very in depth. And so he's saying that,

02:58:15.240 --> 02:58:20.000
you know, the controls for that are going to be pretty sweet. So if SOCOM is going to

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:29.760
be using it, I guess that's a really big title for Sony. I don't have a PS3. So I don't know.

02:58:29.760 --> 02:58:36.960
Then even better, is this the type of peripheral that makes you want to get one?

02:58:36.960 --> 02:58:42.280
And I've always been a sucker for the gimmicky, gimmicky crap in games. Like, you know, I

02:58:42.280 --> 02:58:48.080
have all of, like I had, I got the Game Boy printer, the e-reader, you know, I bought

02:58:48.080 --> 02:58:55.160
the Wii opening day, all that kind of stuff. And so this, this kind of thing, it, it does

02:58:55.160 --> 02:59:04.960
make me want to buy a PS3. The guy said that as far as prices, the unit's going to come

02:59:04.960 --> 02:59:11.000
out with a controller, a game, and the camera all under a hundred dollars when it comes

02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:12.000
out.

02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:14.600
Yeah, I remember that. They did have a little press conference. They said some of that,

02:59:14.600 --> 02:59:17.320
but yeah, I wonder what, I wonder if it's going to be the Monkey Bubble game or what

02:59:17.320 --> 02:59:23.500
it's going to be. So we'll see. Well, real quickly before we let you go, because we want

02:59:23.500 --> 02:59:27.120
to try to get at least one more call tonight. Were there any other quick thoughts you had

02:59:27.120 --> 02:59:30.720
about GDC or something like really interesting? Did you attend any panels or I don't know

02:59:30.720 --> 02:59:34.200
if they call them panels or seminars or what have you, that you just thought were awesome

02:59:34.200 --> 02:59:35.800
and you want to share?

02:59:35.800 --> 02:59:41.560
Um, sadly I didn't get to go to any of the, they, they call them summits there. Um, I

02:59:41.560 --> 02:59:47.880
didn't get to go to any of those because I got the cheap pass, which was still $250 plus

02:59:47.880 --> 02:59:53.560
I live in Orlando, so, uh, I didn't really have the extra.

02:59:53.560 --> 02:59:57.720
Oh, you came all the way out here just for that then. Wow. Cool.

02:59:57.720 --> 03:00:05.760
Um, but what I will say is if you don't mind a little, a little plug here, um, I did a

03:00:05.760 --> 03:00:12.040
vlog every day as I was out there, recorded anything fun that I saw at the expo. Um, if

03:00:12.040 --> 03:00:16.520
you want to see any, if you want to see any of that, uh, I have a YouTube channel, uh,

03:00:16.520 --> 03:00:23.600
youtube.com slash llama juice, all one word. Um, so if you go there, you can see a lot

03:00:23.600 --> 03:00:27.640
of the, a lot of the cool stuff that they had at the expo. They had a lot of virtual

03:00:27.640 --> 03:00:35.920
reality stuff going on. Um, a lot of 3d like glasses with gaming. Um, a lot of stuff like

03:00:35.920 --> 03:00:39.400
that going on. It was some, some pretty cool technology going on there.

03:00:39.400 --> 03:00:43.600
All right. So check that out on youtube. Uh, we'll go, we'll go ahead and let you plug

03:00:43.600 --> 03:00:46.480
that, especially cause we weren't out there ourselves. So I might actually be going to

03:00:46.480 --> 03:00:50.040
look and see what it was like out there on the show floor. So llama juice, good luck

03:00:50.040 --> 03:00:55.280
with blur. Good luck with your schooling for all the environmental stuff. And, uh, we'll

03:00:55.280 --> 03:01:00.880
see you later on the show. Okay. Sounds like a plan. All right. Take care, buddy. Yep.

03:01:00.880 --> 03:01:05.960
You too. Later. We'll take like one more call guys. And I really apologize in advance for

03:01:05.960 --> 03:01:08.520
those folks that don't get through tonight. Please, please, please don't be afraid to

03:01:08.520 --> 03:01:13.100
send us an email, send us some tweets. Uh, one of the other ways. It's just that our

03:01:13.100 --> 03:01:17.520
show is running really long tonight. So, uh, we wanted to just take a couple more calls.

03:01:17.520 --> 03:01:20.560
You guys, I'm just gonna take this first one here. Hi, you're on orange on radio. Who's

03:01:20.560 --> 03:01:26.240
this? Good morning. This is G that's calling him. Hi, G that's. Oh, it's the other Swede,

03:01:26.240 --> 03:01:32.640
right? Oh yes. How are you? My friend. How's it going? Uh, I'm not too bad. A bit tired.

03:01:32.640 --> 03:01:39.040
I've been up since two AM. That is hardcore. My friends hardcore. I really appreciate your

03:01:39.040 --> 03:01:43.040
support. Well, what's on your mind, please. You stayed up late to talk to us. What's up?

03:01:43.040 --> 03:01:47.720
Uh, you already talked about it, I think, but I just want to talk a bit more about Cave

03:01:47.720 --> 03:01:52.800
Story and its awesomeness. If you haven't played it, you really, really need to play

03:01:52.800 --> 03:01:57.660
it because it's freeware on PC and if you really like it on PC, you can always buy it

03:01:57.660 --> 03:02:02.480
on WiiWare because he really deserves it. It's just one guy who made one of the most

03:02:02.480 --> 03:02:10.480
awesome games ever. Now, where, where can people get this game? Uh, I think there's

03:02:10.480 --> 03:02:15.720
a different, like a tribute site that has a download with an English patch because the

03:02:15.720 --> 03:02:20.420
guy who made it is Japanese. Oh, okay. But I don't, I don't think he has his own like

03:02:20.420 --> 03:02:24.600
developer site. It's Studio Pixel, I think he calls himself. He's usually just referred

03:02:24.600 --> 03:02:29.880
to as Pixel. Now, what is it about this game that just made you fall in love with it? Uh,

03:02:29.880 --> 03:02:36.040
it's sort of retro, the music's awesome, the story's actually kind of entertaining and

03:02:36.040 --> 03:02:41.840
it has a, has a couple of twists. It's not your usual Mario, oh, the princess is in another

03:02:41.840 --> 03:02:46.920
castle. You can't really predict what's going to happen. And it's just an unexplored fantasy

03:02:46.920 --> 03:02:55.080
world that you've never seen before. And I like the price of free. That's good. Has anybody

03:02:55.080 --> 03:02:58.360
been able to like follow the guy? I know there's like the language differences, but has anybody

03:02:58.360 --> 03:03:02.000
been able to follow the guy and see if there's a chance of this, like, I don't know, being

03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:09.280
an indie game on Xbox Live or coming out somewhere else besides just the PC? I'm not sure. It

03:03:09.280 --> 03:03:16.160
is coming out on, on WiiWare and I think they had like a report on the Wii channel with

03:03:16.160 --> 03:03:23.400
him and the American developers who met with him and like made the port. But I'm not sure,

03:03:23.400 --> 03:03:27.880
maybe they have like an exclusivity deal with Nintendo because they probably want to keep

03:03:27.880 --> 03:03:33.400
that. Maybe, maybe there's a WiiWare thing coming up. And I do notice, by the way, speaking

03:03:33.400 --> 03:03:38.280
of WiiWare, I guess Dark Tetsuya is all excited. I think La Mulana's released is must be tomorrow

03:03:38.280 --> 03:03:41.920
because I can't think of what else Dark Tetsuya would be excited over, but I know he's in

03:03:41.920 --> 03:03:45.560
there. By the way, did you know Dark Sakura? I know you've been busy with your stuff, but

03:03:45.560 --> 03:03:50.200
a Rondo of Blood finally saw the light of day on Monday. So a part of me wants to hook

03:03:50.200 --> 03:03:57.080
up the Wii and get that. You should. I do. I need to, but it's, it's in a box. Rob, what?

03:03:57.080 --> 03:04:00.600
You know how we were supposed to hang out last week and we didn't. I know. I can't this,

03:04:00.600 --> 03:04:05.320
I'm going to Boston. I know. I'm going to Boston. When you're back. Okay. Rondo of Blood.

03:04:05.320 --> 03:04:09.720
We need to do our show that we've talked about. Yes, we do. We can start with Rondo of Blood.

03:04:09.720 --> 03:04:15.640
It would be fun. Anyway, hi. Heck yeah. Sorry, listener. Well, well Dark Sakura and I have

03:04:15.640 --> 03:04:20.200
an argument. Jiditz, I guess I'll ask you, is there, is there anything else in your mind

03:04:20.200 --> 03:04:25.440
tonight? I just, you said last time that you wanted to know like the phrases in different

03:04:25.440 --> 03:04:32.640
languages when people come in. Yes. So I thought I'd just saying like hi is just hey or hello.

03:04:32.640 --> 03:04:41.920
Oh, that's easy. Hello. Hello. Yeah. Hello. Yeah. Hello. Okay. I can do that. And goodbye

03:04:41.920 --> 03:04:50.160
is like hey door. Hey door. Yeah. Hey door. Hey door. Excellent. Can you go out to the

03:04:50.160 --> 03:04:56.240
barn and close the hey door? All right. I'll try. All right. No, I really appreciate that.

03:04:56.240 --> 03:05:00.800
And now I need AKA Ripper to call in next, which by the way, too bad we already did our

03:05:00.800 --> 03:05:04.560
game show tonight because you and AKA Ripper are both listening tonight. We could have

03:05:04.560 --> 03:05:10.320
had a sweet off. I know you already decided to bow down and, and, and let, let AKA Ripper

03:05:10.320 --> 03:05:15.200
have the title, but dammit, I wanted my sweet off, but I guess, I guess it is to be for

03:05:15.200 --> 03:05:18.960
another day because we are running way too long tonight. We're almost like, I think we're

03:05:18.960 --> 03:05:22.320
like to three and a half hours at this point. So I almost have to go to school soon. Yeah.

03:05:22.320 --> 03:05:26.560
We got to go and wrap this up. Well, you, uh, better get to school young man. And, uh,

03:05:26.560 --> 03:05:29.840
we'll talk to you later. Okay. Yep. Have a good one, buddy.

03:05:30.560 --> 03:05:34.880
So do you buy later? All right. Thank you guys so much for our calls again. I really,

03:05:34.880 --> 03:05:38.640
our phones were like lit up tonight. Like if I, if we took every single call,

03:05:38.640 --> 03:05:45.040
we would be here until G did like was getting home from school. So, uh, but we need to, uh,

03:05:45.040 --> 03:05:51.760
uh, turn off the phones for tonight again. Uh, please email, please Twitter, please Facebook

03:05:51.760 --> 03:05:56.800
and all the other ways that we let you guys have a voice chat room, all of that fun stuff.

03:05:57.920 --> 03:06:01.600
All right. Ooh. Now's the part of the show where we wrap it all up. I think we got all

03:06:01.600 --> 03:06:05.200
of Loki's last minute stories, dark soccer. I don't know if you had any mesmerized by

03:06:05.200 --> 03:06:09.440
reading about the healthcare passing. Yeah. It's on a lot of people's minds

03:06:09.440 --> 03:06:13.520
today. I don't want to get too political, but, um, it's definitely a historical day.

03:06:13.520 --> 03:06:16.240
It's a day that will be remembered. I was just looking to find out what

03:06:16.240 --> 03:06:19.760
the specifics were because keep in mind, all I've been hearing is all the crap from my

03:06:19.760 --> 03:06:25.200
Republican slash libertarian family. And while I have a good deal in common with

03:06:26.160 --> 03:06:29.440
the libertarian platform, there are certain things that I think need to be done.

03:06:29.440 --> 03:06:34.400
I'm not going to go into it, but I've been trying to see what exactly made it. So,

03:06:34.400 --> 03:06:37.600
So what exactly is this again? Is this that national healthcare thing? Do I have to pay

03:06:37.600 --> 03:06:40.960
more taxes for people that don't have jobs so they can get their fucking healthcare?

03:06:40.960 --> 03:06:44.000
Cause that's what it seems like it's like anyways already.

03:06:45.120 --> 03:06:50.800
Um, I think they are going to tax the really high, high, high plans like the Cadillac plan.

03:06:50.800 --> 03:06:54.720
So that was what I was just reading. If you have a really nice plan, you might,

03:06:54.720 --> 03:06:57.360
but if your plan has like any deductibles or anything like that,

03:06:57.360 --> 03:07:01.120
it's probably not one of those plans. Well, the biggest thing on here is that, um,

03:07:02.640 --> 03:07:07.920
instead of treating symptoms with Existrix, basically the car dealer type of deal where

03:07:07.920 --> 03:07:12.800
you get more money for the options that go with it, then the focus will be on curing the problem

03:07:12.800 --> 03:07:17.040
and not the symptoms of the problem, not treating the symptoms, not getting a kickback for selling

03:07:17.040 --> 03:07:22.160
prescriptions, basically. I will say this much. I don't want to get too much into what I do for

03:07:22.160 --> 03:07:28.480
a living and to earn my paychecks, but I do work for a big healthcare, um, uh, company here in

03:07:28.480 --> 03:07:33.280
California. And I'll just say, I'm really interested for work tomorrow. It's going to be a heck of a day

03:07:33.280 --> 03:07:40.000
tomorrow. So I'm just, I'm very curious to see what's going to happen. But, um, you know, change

03:07:40.000 --> 03:07:45.760
is always inevitable. And I think this is one of those things that, um, what was going to happen.

03:07:45.760 --> 03:07:50.320
So we'll, we'll see what happens. My only, I will just say this. My only concern about the whole

03:07:50.320 --> 03:07:55.440
thing is that I think that all of the other government programs need major revamping. So,

03:07:55.440 --> 03:08:00.560
because I think that, yeah, you can change one thing, but you really have to look at what the

03:08:00.560 --> 03:08:05.040
absolute root of the problem is. And I think that that's with the government itself. I don't know

03:08:05.040 --> 03:08:09.440
necessarily that I trust them with my money. I just hope we get a new trauma center game out of

03:08:09.440 --> 03:08:15.120
all this. That's what I really want. Trauma center healthcare bill. They could make a game out of

03:08:15.120 --> 03:08:21.040
trying to pass a trauma center senate. Have you seen the South Park that was, uh, earlier this

03:08:21.040 --> 03:08:26.560
week where they were mocking the whole Tiger Woods 11 and it was, you know, like heavy rain almost

03:08:26.560 --> 03:08:31.600
where he's fighting off his wife or his girlfriend or whatever. No, I hadn't heard. It's about heavy

03:08:31.600 --> 03:08:35.840
rain. No, it was, it was like, you know, they're, they're playing the game or whatever and he's

03:08:35.840 --> 03:08:40.880
doing the apology and all of a sudden, you know, she comes up on stage and starts like beating

03:08:40.880 --> 03:08:47.360
them up with the, uh, with the golf club and cheeses, the prenup, uh, power up and stuff

03:08:47.360 --> 03:08:53.200
like that. It's pretty funny. I love SSJ was 100 Matt's comment and I'm even going to make it my

03:08:53.200 --> 03:08:57.040
final thought tonight. So we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought tonight. Uh,

03:08:57.040 --> 03:09:00.480
and I'm going to leave it with what SSJ 100 Matt said. Cause I think it's great

03:09:00.480 --> 03:09:06.080
change. It's always good because you can take it all to coin star. Low key your final thought

03:09:06.080 --> 03:09:12.640
tonight. I need me some money. Alan, thank you for being here on the show tonight. I hope you

03:09:12.640 --> 03:09:15.680
got to say more than you did last time. I think you did participating in listless really helped

03:09:15.680 --> 03:09:20.160
you. Is there any final thought you have tonight? I want tacos. We'll get tacos. We'll get your

03:09:20.160 --> 03:09:25.040
tacos. You want Del Taco or Taco Bell? Uh, Del Taco. All right. See, look what I've turned him

03:09:25.040 --> 03:09:31.040
into. This Bay area kid has fallen in love with Del Taco. I love it. Dark Sakura. Thanks for

03:09:31.040 --> 03:09:38.480
strolling in late tonight. We appreciate it. If you don't like it, Dark Sakura,

03:09:38.480 --> 03:09:45.600
your final thoughts tonight. Horseradish is still burning. Thank you guys so much for

03:09:45.600 --> 03:09:50.000
listening to our show and supporting independent radio. We really, really appreciate your support.

03:09:50.000 --> 03:09:53.360
We appreciate the five star reviews you guys leave on iTunes and we really appreciate when

03:09:53.360 --> 03:09:57.920
you tell friends about the show and help spread the word. Yeah, we always want more listeners

03:09:57.920 --> 03:10:02.480
and you got two weeks to do it. Unfortunately, there will be no show next week, but stay tuned

03:10:02.480 --> 03:10:08.640
to our social networking sites for a special bonus special Rob on the road at penny arcade East.

03:10:08.640 --> 03:10:14.240
And if you're one of our listeners find me at PAX East because I will be interviewing folks. My,

03:10:14.240 --> 03:10:19.920
my goal is to have this show be like an Epic four hour show. Just me talking to listeners,

03:10:19.920 --> 03:10:26.160
me talking to developers, me talking to you at PAX East. So remember what word has been repeated

03:10:26.160 --> 03:10:34.480
the most? Me, me, me, me, me, me, the me show. Yay. No, it's the Rob show. It's starring him.

03:10:35.120 --> 03:10:40.080
No, it's the gamers having a voice show and I'm just the person that helps them get their voices

03:10:40.080 --> 03:10:47.360
out. It's the Rob show. Hey, look, you could come to packs too. If I could sneak you in my suitcase.

03:10:48.800 --> 03:10:53.360
I'm so freaking broke, but you'll have to, uh, you'll have to say for packs prime in August

03:10:53.360 --> 03:10:57.360
labor day weekend, right? Cause I'm trying to get Alan to go to packs prime. Alan wants to go to

03:10:57.360 --> 03:11:02.400
packs prime. Yes. I want someone to pay for me to go cause I'm broke. And E3 I got E3 on the

03:11:02.400 --> 03:11:08.640
horizon too. I can't, I can't afford to go to Disneyland. Oh no. Unless I have a full paid way

03:11:08.640 --> 03:11:14.320
there. That's going to be rough. That's Disneyland ain't cheap. I know. All right. You guys are

03:11:14.320 --> 03:11:19.040
invited to my birthday party that we can do. You have, you know what you do have your birthday

03:11:19.040 --> 03:11:24.640
party with Disney decorations. My birthday. If you want, we'll get a little teacup. I'll spin

03:11:24.640 --> 03:11:30.000
you around. My birthday party is going to be a beer pot luck. Everybody brings different types

03:11:30.000 --> 03:11:34.560
of beer as long as it's good. It's a great idea. All right. That's it. We're out of here. It's

03:11:34.560 --> 03:11:39.200
been an Epic show tonight. Thank you all for being a part of it and making it happen. You have
