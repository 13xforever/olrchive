69	6473	Tonight, March 7th, 2010, we get first impressions on Final Fantasy XIII.
6633	17701	One of our favorite games is patched with teasers of a sequel, and the Rock Band Network goes live.
46545	56630	I come bearing a message from President Cat Here in California, home of Silicon Valley, home of video games We are in a budget crisis
57481	61463	State employees are furloughed, meaning we can't go to the DMV most Fridays.
62344	66086	Students are protesting out on the freeways amidst high tuition cutbacks.
66926	75591	Yet somehow our legislatures found the time last week to pass a resolution supporting anti-cussing week to take place this very week.
76411	76931	Thanks for watching!
94557	104043	However, substituting words like oh pickles and sassafras, which have all of the same intent, is somehow okay and makes you a smarter person.
105404	108626	As residents of the state of California, we reject this notion.
109627	116852	As intelligent individuals, we take offense to the notion that using versatile swear words somehow demonstrates a lack of intelligence.
117793	124057	As free citizens of the United States of America living under the First Amendment, we say fuck yeah to free speech.
125137	132942	We will work tonight in protest of No Cussing Week to break the record for most uses of the F word on an internet podcast.
133582	140486	Tonight, on a very special Orange Lounge Radio, we bring you The Fuck Show.
142847	145929	America!
146169	148871	America!
149191	150152	America!
150192	150992	Fuck yeah!
151052	153874	Come and if you have to save the motherfucker
159452	161054	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
184790	190913	I'm just fucking annoyed at people feeling like they have to defend their own fucking opinion every fucking time someone says something that's different from them.
191233	191673	So fuck them.
192133	193974	Not really fuck them, but just fuck in general.
194034	194934	I know, just fuck them.
194954	195955	Right in their fucking ears.
196515	200757	Hey, say hello to the one and only, he is so fucking smart, Tech Master Loki!
201157	202378	I keep fucking coughing.
202918	204199	I wish this fucking gold would go away.
204219	206560	You have been fucking sick for like three fucking weeks now.
206600	210901	I haven't been coughing all day long, but then all of a sudden this fucking coughing started after I ate all my chicken.
211102	211582	Would you like some tea?
212522	213983	No, I really hate fucking tea.
214604	215465	Tea is awful.
217026	218427	No, I think it's the root beer.
218787	221509	And while delicious the root beer was, it makes me cough.
222050	222790	And that's not good.
223351	224772	Are you allergic to fucking root beer?
224832	226053	No, I am not allergic to root beer.
226093	226774	Root beer is awesome.
226894	232318	It's just, you know, the carbonation or whatever kind of loosens the fucking phlegm in my throat.
232378	233619	So, it sucks.
234780	235741	But yeah, otherwise I'm fine.
236521	237062	I'm fucking great.
237462	238403	Alright, glad to hear it.
239043	243627	All right, well, folks, we do have some gaming news to get into a little later.
243707	249471	But first, we always fucking start off the show talking about our fucking gaming weeks, like anybody really gives a fuck what we've been playing.
249851	251712	But that's just how you do a video game podcast.
251732	254054	We've been doing it a very fucking long time, about eight years.
254294	257076	So we used to start a little segment called How was your day?
257116	257676	How was your week?
257736	258977	But no one really gave a shit.
259037	261959	So we evolved it to fucking video games.
262020	263961	So how the fuck was your gaming week, DarkSakra?
264284	265365	It was fucking boring.
266186	270509	I played Star Trek Online and made it to Lieutenant Commander, finally, fuck yeah.
271430	277434	And a guy, this weird Klingon chick and a Bajoran dude, but fuck him.
278415	281437	And that's about all.
281818	282518	I didn't do fuck all.
284179	284460	Alright.
284800	286301	It's more fucking Star Trek Online.
286341	288463	Same fucking story every fucking week, but that's alright.
288763	290664	That's what it's like to be fucking addicted to an MMO.
290845	291265	I should know.
291792	292552	I'm not addicted.
292612	293012	Fuck you.
293793	294493	Okay, sorry.
294813	296474	Maybe not fucking addicted.
296594	298134	I set a day.
299314	300875	A day that is my fuck off day.
301575	302676	Where I do fuck all.
303836	305997	But play my damn game and fuck around on the internet.
307017	308337	I think it's good to have a fuck off day.
308597	310318	I have fuck off days on days ending in one.
310358	311618	I've actually started a project.
312959	316820	A fantastic fucking project that doesn't involve fucking, by the way.
317700	319521	Called Project Real Life.
321078	331130	Where this thing, this evil box, this fucking whore of a computer gets turned off How the fuck are you able to function?
331551	339561	But you're fucking playing the game in real life So I don't understand what the fucking point is I'm paying attention to my own fucking real life
341687	342507	Well, fuck me then.
343848	344248	No, thank you.
344928	345208	All right.
346009	347369	Loki, how the fuck was your gaming week?
347769	351210	Well, let's talk about how awesome my gaming week was.
352171	352471	No, wait.
352491	354131	Let's talk about how awful today was.
354272	355272	Today was a fucking mess.
356477	358158	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
374651	375712	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
403864	407945	Stockton would kind of be, it's kind of like between the asshole and the balls.
408345	412146	So Stockton is kind of the fucking taint of California.
412426	414006	And there's nothing on the way.
414066	415026	And it's not pleasurable.
415406	416347	It's just cow country.
416427	418827	Fucking shitty smelling cow country.
419367	424548	Anyways, so I decided, okay, mind you, I woke up at 730 this morning.
424908	426369	That's fucking early on a Sunday.
427349	428569	I drove all the way down there.
429009	438744	Met the guy just before 9, gave him my console, paid him the $60 it would be to solder in the chip that I wanted him to solder in.
439185	441368	Told me it would take about 30-45 minutes.
443823	461808	Four hours later, waiting in fucking Stockton, the guy's not returning any of my text messages, he's not returning any of my phone calls, and so I'm fucking sitting there going, okay, well, I guess I'm either gonna fucking sit here all day, or I'm gonna have to fucking leave and leave my console behind and assume that I'm getting ripped off.
461908	463028	So, that's what happened.
463108	464549	I got fucking ripped off, apparently.
464889	465489	Well, fuck him.
466289	467510	Yes, fuck him indeed.
467690	478238	And so I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt for now and assume that this really was a mistake and his phone is all fucked up or whatever.
478819	486104	And so I will be polite and contact him by email, giving him the opportunity to fucking ship me my console.
486525	490648	However, if he doesn't do that, then I'm fucking posting his phone number and posting his email.
490970	493511	Hey, don't forget, send me his IP.
494451	495731	I will find his fucking address.
496592	500213	We can go show up at his house and say, fuck you, give it back.
504794	507515	This is not the C-Word show, fuck you.
507935	511976	And then Final Fantasy XIII, that's basically been my gaming week.
512403	516264	By the way, DarkSakura is just fucking openly swearing randomly at our fucking chat room.
516324	520925	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to join all the fucking action tonight in our chat room.
520965	524626	Yes, three hours of this tonight, ladies and fucking gentlemen.
524926	526447	It could be this or the Oscars.
526647	527847	I mean, honestly.
527907	532568	Keep track of how many fucks get fucking said so that we can fucking send it to fucking Guinness and fucking Ireland.
533188	533388	Fuck.
533689	534069	Amazing.
534089	535429	Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
535789	537732	Stop trying to run up the counter artificially.
537912	538794	That's not artificial.
538934	539454	Fucking stop it.
540075	543460	I'm legitimately saying fuck and I can say fuck as much as I fucking want to, Rob.
543480	544201	So fuck you.
545282	545703	In a good way.
546364	547786	Loki, any more in your fucking gaming week?
548507	549108	I fucking love you.
549548	550429	I fucking love you too, bitch.
550449	551531	I also played some more of...
553613	554294	Oh, what the fuck.
555234	555715	Borderlands.
555955	562760	I play more Borderlands because I'm trying to get the game finished before I can fucking start the new expansion.
563541	565282	And I'm liking it still.
566003	569285	And I just have to level up my characters.
569305	573749	I actually have to level up my friend's character because he's fucking 18 levels below me.
574349	574609	So...
576775	599042	Yeah, so I played a little bit more of that, and of course Grand Theft Auto, you know, fucking, what, rank like 74 now in the true skill ranks, and then I'm still fucking like 195 in the regular ranks, just because I don't play on the weekends, and it's, you know, kind of bounces around during the week, so, but true skill's really where I'm, you know, trying to get to the top of the fucking list, and doing pretty good, so.
599582	599862	That's it.
600563	605546	You notice how our chat room has been increasing exponentially?
606387	607827	Oh, and fuckdeft, cunt.
610609	611050	I said it.
611150	613171	I hate that word, and I said it, so whatever.
613411	616713	I'm looking at the chat, and all these fucking people are in there tonight.
616753	617714	We love you all, by the way.
618194	620516	We fucking love you and your support so much.
621096	623057	But we have Hardcore77777.
623077	624779	That's a lot of fucking sevens in his name there.
625099	627420	Says, oh, wow, I picked a bad night to listen.
628841	631282	Yes, you fucking... Welcome to your first fucking live show.
631322	632463	Congratulations.
633203	634524	Who was that?
634604	636985	Isn't any week a fucking bad night to listen?
637005	638506	Who was that?
638526	638866	Hardcore 7777777777.
639066	639386	Seven.
639406	639606	Seven.
642007	644869	And Akula fucking GP says, Fucking GTA again?
644969	645849	Fuck, Loki, fuck.
646309	647850	Hey, I play that every fucking day.
647930	648730	Twice fucking day.
648831	650671	Actually, sometimes three fucking times a day.
651292	654193	And I fuck everyone up in it because I'm so fucking awesome.
654313	655814	So, I have to.
656654	657735	I have to mention it every week.
658395	659135	It's what I'm proud of.
660036	669520	In fact, actually, we'll get into this a little bit fucking later, but remember how they updated some TOS stuff for Xbox Live?
670121	678325	And now I can post my Ballad of Gay Tony ranks in there without the word gay being fucking banning me.
679520	681061	Oh, well, congratulations, I suppose.
681101	682562	There's a good reason.
682582	684143	That whole policy was kind of fucked anyway.
684163	685304	It was overcompensating.
685324	686665	Is that a story later we're going to get into?
686785	688366	I should probably shut my fucking mouth then.
689467	693469	Anything else you want to talk about during your fucking gaming week?
696431	697252	Final Fantasy's awesome.
699215	700656	All right, my fucking gaming week.
701136	702837	I've been playing a lot of fucking WoW as usual.
703218	708141	My character's probably to about fucking level 53, I think I finally fucking dinged this week.
708161	708761	Fucking addict.
709762	710362	Shut the fuck up.
711503	712463	Bite my fucking ass.
713744	718327	My boyfriend, though, he got to level fucking 55, so he can roll a fucking Death Knight now whenever the fuck he wants.
718367	722890	But we might do like the twin Death Knight thing like fucking later, but I don't know.
722930	725492	Like right now the fucking focus is getting his fucking character to 80.
726392	743557	but the problem is I found another game that's gonna fucking sink all my time for the next two weeks which I'll get into in a minute but I wanted to talk about a couple of other fucking games real quick one of them is Critter Crunch it's so fucking cute and I finally played the full version of the game I played the fucking demo before it's fucking cute it's a lot like Magical Drop did you ever fucking play that?
744578	745658	Yeah, I play that.
745898	747579	I didn't really care for it too much.
748100	753343	Imagine if Magical Drop wasn't about matching the fucking colors, but it was about putting things in a fucking sequence.
753963	759647	Like, instead of fucking all the blues disappear, it's like you gotta go fucking green, red, and blue in an order, or whatever.
759727	760828	That sounds too fucking complicated.
760868	766171	No, it's not that fucking bad, because it's little bugs, fucking medium-sized bugs, and then big bugs.
766724	782235	and it's pretty intuitive to figure out it's not that fucking hard and there's these weird elements too where you fucking barf rainbows into little critters mouth and all these like overly cute fucking things well no wonder you fucking like it barfing rainbows shut up
783035	784016	It's fucking cute, shut up.
784537	785938	And there's lots of modes in it.
785998	792204	I wish I'd bought the fucking game when it was on sale, but it's okay because it's on Alan's PlayStation 3 so I can play it whenever the fuck I'm over there.
792224	792845	But it was really cute.
793185	797710	I played through a good probably 15 stages while I was there and got some trophies.
798831	799231	It's cute.
799792	804637	I think it's a fucking good deal and if I wasn't so busy playing something else right now, I might fucking buy the full version.
804857	805898	Who wants some fucking tequila?
806434	807354	You have fucking tequila?
807454	808054	You bought it.
808275	809995	If I didn't have to fucking drive home, I would.
810015	810755	You can do a shot now.
812096	813956	As if my swearing wasn't bad enough right now.
813996	814676	Well, fuck it.
814976	815977	It's a night just to fuck it.
816197	816997	Do you want some tequila?
817197	817777	I don't want any tequila.
817797	818237	I better pass.
818277	818617	I better pass.
818897	819358	Thank you, though.
819378	819558	Fine.
819578	820658	I'll drink my beer by myself.
820958	822378	You fucking drink yourself into a coma.
822718	822999	All right.
823939	824259	Let's see.
825919	826820	I play Misty, too.
827240	827600	Why is that?
828160	829280	Just tell me about fucking beer.
831341	831661	Let's see.
831761	833001	What the fuck else is I playing?
833081	835302	Oh, Final Fantasy II on the fucking iPhone.
836365	837506	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
860445	889473	but they have made some fucking adjustments to it to make it more touch friendly for instance when you're in a battle you have all these little fucking icons instead of the words to attack and even when you're in the menus to cast fucking magic there's these little fucking icons that show up that you use to cast your fucking spells and shit and you know if you want to cast your spell on all the fucking enemies you drag your finger to select all the enemies you can't unfortunately just fucking sit there and hammer the A button to get through all the fucking battles you know you have to kind of tap tap tap tap
889813	913955	so everything's a little bit fucking slower that's not the annoying part I don't fucking mind that as much as I do when you're in the fucking towns and you're having to use the fucking fake d-pad that's on the touch screen and the fucking button to run and you're trying to talk to fucking towns people because the frame rate is so fucking bad and everything is so fucking jumpy that you literally have to chase all the fucking town people around for a fucking minute just to fucking talk to them which shouldn't be that fucking hard in a Final Fantasy game
916201	921446	Well, they don't fucking tell you that before you buy it, so you won't know until you buy it.
921546	925069	But I will say this, $9 is a pretty fucking good price for Final Fantasy 2.
925149	930875	Again, I bought Final Fantasy 2 because I played the original fucking Final Fantasy a ton of times, so whatever.
931435	954280	um but the Final Fantasy fucking 2 I only played once on the PSP so I decided what the fuck I'll buy this just to kind of check it out it's only nine dollars I will say this if you have a fucking PSP just spend the extra ten dollars to get a copy of the Final Fantasy probably not even that expensive nowadays yeah you could probably fucking find it used somewhere for cheaper so if you're gonna pay nine dollars for the fucking iPhone version did I say nucking is that a good
955609	957131	Nuck and... Nuck and futz!
959094	960756	It's fuck-ing.
960996	962398	Yeah, thank you, I know.
963399	967644	If you're gonna spend half as much to get the iPhone version, then you fucking get what you fucking pay for.
967664	968305	That's all I have to say.
968325	972670	When it comes to controls, it's kind of weak sauce, but it is a beautiful game, and...
973544	974024	and DarkSakura.com.
999830	1004033	Final Fantasy XIII is on its way out on Tuesday, and we got a copy through legitimate purposes.
1004053	1005794	Don't you worry, it's totally legit and all that stuff.
1005814	1008596	Just a few days early, just so we could jump in there and have something to say about it today.
1008616	1008676	Um...
1025087	1038839	It played through the game and I've read a lot of the reviews that are online just like a lot of you guys have about how the game is really fucking linear and it's kind of just an interactive movie where you're just fucking bashing the X button for a long time.
1039319	1040320	And I kind of go, well...
1041241	1048007	Final Fantasy VII, I see a lot of comparisons from XIII to VII, at least in the bits that I've played so far.
1048488	1054694	I remember in Final Fantasy VII, you started that game and you were in Midgar, and you were trapped there.
1055194	1057296	I shouldn't say trapped, it makes it sound like you couldn't do anything.
1057637	1062101	But you were playing a somewhat linear story for about the first seven hours of Final Fantasy VII.
1062161	1062301	Mm-hmm.
1062561	1067367	and tell you, depending on, you know, how fast or slow you are, you tell you get out of Midgar and explore the overworld.
1067807	1073434	Now, I know an overworld, well, I don't, I don't really know what, I haven't read spoilers on 13 and I don't want to know, so chat, stay quiet.
1073855	1078921	I don't know if there's an overworld that shows up, but I already know there's no towns, so I imagine it's going to stay kind of very 10-ish.
1078941	1082565	Well, they have Chocobo writing and they have the manual, so obviously...
1082845	1086808	Okay, so there's going to be some type of overworld later that's going to be similar to 7.
1087049	1090372	In fact, honestly, guys, this game has a lot in common with 7.
1090712	1092954	There's a lot of the same types of characters.
1093414	1097017	Like, Lightning and Cloud have a lot in common, except one's got a vagina.
1098939	1101701	There's, you know, the emo kid that you just want to slap across the face.
1102021	1104363	There's your sassy black man that's there for comic relief.
1104504	1106525	I mean, there's a lot of similarities.
1107126	1107246	And...
1108727	1109628	But that isn't a bad thing.
1109668	1111691	I mean, Final Fantasy VII was a really good game.
1111791	1118960	It got overblown a little bit by the fucking crazy-ass fans out there, but it was still a good game.
1121246	1121466	X2 or X2?
1121486	1121506	X2.
1150127	1153129	I think that's a lot of... I mean, Lost Odyssey kind of had some of that too.
1153149	1158472	A lot of the JRPGs are... It does remind me a lot of Lost Odyssey, actually.
1159453	1162555	But Lost Odyssey was more like Final Fantasy.
1162595	1169240	But when I say it takes three hours to get there, I don't want you thinking you're just fucking bored for three hours just sitting there jerking off doing nothing.
1169800	1176885	I kind of find this game to be like a banana or something that slowly peels and slowly unfolds and starts to show its true shape.
1177145	1178486	And if you don't...
1179506	1186368	I don't know if you read any of the manual or anything before you started, but like Falsi and Lassi and stuff like that.
1186468	1188508	I was like, what the fuck are they talking about?
1188548	1189529	Turn the subtitles on.
1190249	1191769	I have the subtitles on.
1192029	1194010	Interjection, just to fucking interject.
1194510	1196430	I'm currently not listening to this because I haven't played it yet.
1197151	1198211	I'm trying to keep the spoiler free.
1198251	1199691	I'm not going to give stories.
1199731	1201852	But I want to be completely surprised.
1202012	1202732	So I'm
1203092	1205675	I will give little spoilers about the battle system because it's essential to the game.
1205695	1206456	I am zoning the fuck out.
1206536	1208218	Okay, fucking zone out all you want.
1208778	1209599	Sorry, Loki, what were you saying?
1209679	1210961	No, it's confusing.
1211441	1218949	And I do have the subtitles and stuff turned on because I don't want to... My audio or whatever, because I have the 5.1 headphones or whatever, it's very...
1220791	1221572	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1243234	1243714	Thanks for watching!
1260646	1261907	that occur in the story.
1261947	1265009	So there's a lot of similarities, I think, between watching Lost on TV.
1265329	1267790	But you know how Lost kind of divides people?
1267830	1270612	Some people are like, this show's too fucking slow for me.
1270652	1272013	They need to get to the fucking point already.
1272453	1275215	That's going to be what makes or breaks people on Final Fantasy XIII, I think, as well.
1275655	1276156	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1293997	1296599	I want to speak really quickly about the battle system.
1296679	1297360	Real quick, okay?
1298881	1301543	Final Fantasy introduces this new thing called paradigm shifts.
1302204	1309090	And the easiest fucking way I could explain it is that imagine you could flip your character from a black mage to a white mage right in the middle of battle.
1309830	1332578	that's what the paradigm shifts are all about and it's a lot cooler than I think I'm making it sound because like you know you might be doing a battle and you're trying to chain things to get the monster to kind of slip into this mode where it's easier to hit it and then all of a sudden you're like oh shit I'm low on HP I better paradigm shift so I suddenly get a medic in my party and also maybe somebody that casts barrier and all that shit to protect people and then once everybody's cured up go back to assault
1333078	1334219	It's really fucking awesome.
1353008	1355049	It's a lot more fluid than X2.
1355769	1359550	X2 had those big, big, big animations with the dress spheres and everything.
1359850	1360971	It's a lot quicker than that.
1361031	1363051	It's not so over the top like it was in X2.
1363131	1364632	It feels a lot more fluid.
1364972	1368493	I'm going to say the battle system in XIII to me feels a little bit more like an action game.
1368873	1371254	It takes active time battle to the next level.
1371674	1372954	It is fast-paced.
1373294	1374575	It is very fucking fast.
1374615	1381017	I remember much like the other Final Fantasy games, to get a preemptive strike or whatever is kind of random.
1381657	1388421	And it works a little bit different too where you don't necessarily do damage to them but it jumps that combo up so that you can do more damage to them later on.
1403731	1404672	Good, good question.
1404772	1407214	Really fucking great question from YYR in chat.
1407454	1412619	So does this mean you don't have to use any strategy when choosing your party because you can swap at any time?
1413260	1416483	So far, and again, granted, I'm only five and a half hours in right now.
1416523	1421448	For those that are playing the game, I'm in a place called... I think it's called the Valley of Ruin is what it's called.
1421768	1422288	That's all I'll say.
1422308	1423670	I don't want to spoil stories or whatever.
1424250	1424330	Um...
1425751	1451876	you don't have control over who's in your party people switch in and out based on the story in fact there's a lot of these people are over here and these people are over here these people are over here and their paths intersect once in a while there's a lot of that going on early on in the game so you don't really have a lot of control over your party I think later on you'll be able to control that more and also don't worry the way the XP works is very similar to Ten's experience system where you're kind of moving around the board spending points and
1452496	1467332	and that was a little confusing too because I was trying to figure out I was like trying because they're all yeah you pick the direction you want to go and you hold this button down I'm like I want to go this way and it's going the opposite direction I'm like no I want to go the other way it's all right it makes it makes sense later on as you're using it's very similar to Ten's
1467652	1470693	All your characters gain points when anyone in your party wins.
1470954	1473775	So it's not like you're going to have these obscenely under-leveled characters.
1473795	1474675	In fact, there are no levels.
1475115	1476736	There's no levels for the characters.
1476956	1477737	There's no levels.
1478077	1479157	There's no XP.
1480038	1483059	But you have kind of the 10 system instead is what you have in place of that.
1483659	1510497	there's no magic points which is a huge shift there's something else they use instead of magic points but your characters are going to be flinging fire and arrow left and right with no consequence you have to really think about that and there is um what else do I want to say there's no magic and there's no oh and after every battle you're cured to full you don't have to cure your party after every battle you start heal everybody yeah it's
1511357	1512078	A lot of changes.
1512778	1515721	Some people are not going to like it, but I say give it a chance.
1515941	1518323	I think it's a lot of fucking fun, and I'm five and a half hours in.
1518664	1519364	I am hooked.
1519644	1521106	Hooked, hooked, hooked.
1521666	1524769	You guys know I have fucking gamer ADD really fucking bad.
1524789	1525870	I'm always like, ooh, shiny.
1525890	1529453	I want to go play this fucking blur beta, or I'm going to go play Game Room or something.
1529853	1531235	I will see this game out to completion.
1531475	1531755	I will.
1531875	1532376	I know I will.
1533036	1533677	Thanks for watching!
1543447	1544787	You might hate these guys too.
1545427	1546428	So just a word of caution.
1547188	1548928	Because I see a lot of similarities.
1549068	1558070	And I don't want to fall down the path of the really nerdy gamer that's virgin in his basement and stuff.
1558090	1560691	Because we know that's not really the truth of me.
1561351	1562211	Fuck those stereotypes.
1562371	1563291	But here's what I'm saying, dude.
1563431	1569513	And I feel really wrong saying this, but Vanille is fucking hot.
1570353	1571974	Like, it's like, what the fuck?
1571994	1572815	She's like 15.
1572935	1573975	That is gross.
1574276	1574756	Fucking cocktease.
1574776	1576277	Like, she's a pedophile's dream.
1576337	1576877	It's kind of disgusting.
1576897	1581540	No, but seriously, it's like, oh, not to spoil anything, where'd you get your seal?
1581740	1583301	Oh, it's right here in my upper thigh.
1583322	1584662	I'm like, oh, come on!
1585743	1590127	Yeah, that was... Alan and I were both, like, just had that big reaction of, oh, I feel dirty.
1590267	1591748	Oh, oh, oh, God, that was dirty.
1591849	1592309	Oh, God.
1592329	1593890	I need to go take a bath in Clorox.
1593930	1596993	And what's up with her voice actor, or actress, I should say?
1597053	1600897	It's just, like, got an accent, and she's way too... too upbeat and...
1602598	1603659	I don't even know what's wrong.
1624594	1625215	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1645902	1646283	Did they?
1646483	1647424	I didn't play enough of 10-2.
1648025	1649026	I watched some people play it.
1649046	1649787	I didn't really get into it that much.
1649807	1656916	Keep in mind that the ending cinemas, actually a lot of the cinemas were re-synced to also fit the English dialogue.
1657417	1662664	And the end sequence, the little song that Yuna gets up and sings was completely re-animated.
1663226	1679026	I was fucking blown away by the like it's those little things that just made me go whoa and by the way since it hasn't really been mentioned yet the game is fucking gorgeous it is a beautiful beautiful game and I know I've seen those reports out there saying oh the 360 version looks you know worse than the PS3
1680447	1680967	Who cares?
1680987	1681868	Just play the fucking game.
1682468	1683929	I don't care what system you get it on.
1684249	1686290	Dan has already said that we're getting the PS3 one.
1686410	1692513	And that's what I got too, but I was just... I just knew the 360 was a port, and you know what?
1692633	1695274	I just... I wanted my achievement points.
1696214	1696574	Did you go 360?
1697355	1697755	Yes, I did.
1697835	1698035	I went 360.
1698075	1698255	Oh, okay.
1700376	1700697	S3 Discs
1717833	1745334	it's just it's a beautiful game it is so like I just blown away by some of the visuals and like it's not all just like the industrial looks that you've seen in the trailers and things it is a beautiful fucking game well it was funny my friend you know at work he was like oh I don't know if this Final Fantasy is gonna be good or whatever so we played you know I started playing the game and literally got five minutes into it and it got that first action sequence that's in the train where she's jumping off the fucking walls and shit and he's like
1746094	1747415	Yeah, this game's not going to be a problem.
1750276	1750536	Nice.
1751176	1752937	Alright, enough about Final Fantasy XIII.
1752977	1755058	I'm sure we will talk some fucking more about it next week.
1755098	1757059	And I will work the F word more into my dialogue.
1757079	1761500	I'm sorry, I just want to have a serious conversation because that's like one serious topic I know people have been wondering about.
1761600	1767123	But isn't part of this to prove that you can make a fucking serious point and sound fucking intelligent even if you're using fucking?
1767323	1768643	No, I'm still saying fuck a little bit.
1768803	1770104	I still wanted to go over the top with it.
1770683	1772846	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com
1787545	1801030	Also, quickly here, quickly, quickly, I want to play a fucking voicemail from our good pal Breslul about USL Madness, the fucking voting going on in our forums right now to determine the best fucking game of all fucking time.
1801070	1802370	It's going on in our forums right now.
1802410	1805011	Here's an update from the one and only Breslul.
1806392	1815775	Hey Rob, Jamie, and Matt, this is Breslul, and I'm a bit under the weather as my voice is clearly giving it away, but I'm calling once again to promote USL Madness.
1816896	1819557	here on the OrangeZonesRadio.com forums.
1821778	1827581	We have four matchups right now, and the four games will be going to the Final Four.
1828521	1837365	We have Mario 3 vs. Ocarina of Time, Final Fantasy 6 vs. DDR, Chrono Trigger vs. Super Metroid, and Link to the Past vs. Mega Man 2.
1838205	1842687	Four of those games go on to the Final Four, and it's up to you, the listeners,
1843385	1844705	to decide who goes on.
1845766	1851147	We have several, I guess four, we have like three of them that are actually really close.
1852927	1863149	So log on to our forums by the end of the night tonight and get your votes in because Tuesday we will have the final four and I think things will get interesting.
1864409	1866670	Until then, see you guys later.
1866910	1867310	Take care.
1867330	1867750	Bye-bye.
1868129	1870475	Someone get Brestle a fucking cough drop, Jesus.
1870555	1874103	I wonder where the term under the weather originated.
1874724	1877892	Because if you're feeling really great, are you over the weather?
1879045	1880385	is it on fucking Wikipedia or something?
1880425	1885727	I'll look it up you are not playing the fucking unicorn game again, are you?
1885767	1892248	I fucking played Robot Unicorn today I actually, I did download the anus game did you fucking play it yet?
1892268	1900810	I didn't play any fucking anus you need to play the pink anus before next week trust me, once you get sucked into Final Fantasy XIII that's all you're gonna fucking play
1900950	1901791	I'm going to be pretty busy.
1917886	1918947	Real fucking life!
1939517	1942879	Well, the 3D version was just not playing at the right time, and it's more expensive.
1943319	1949341	And I honestly don't think the fucking 3D was that good, and, you know, Alice in Wonderland, just based off what I saw in the trailer.
1949842	1955084	By the way, I neglected, some of our chatters are really fucking confused right now that we're suddenly talking about playing The Pink Anus.
1955504	1957865	Let me give some fucking background to that.
1958145	1959526	First off, listen to last week's show.
1959566	1960546	It's all fucking explained there.
1960586	1963187	But there's a game on Steam called, what the fuck is it?
1963247	1964528	Secrets of the Magic Crystal?
1965328	1968670	And it's a game that looks like you're breeding unicorns or some fucking bullshit.
1969290	1994609	but one of the items that you're using if you look at the various screenshots one of the items you use in your fucking horse breeding has these little pink bars and they're called anus a-e-n-u-s so we officially have fucking called this the pink anus game because it's funny and you get to say anus and you're not being vulgar you're just talking about what's in a video game so there you fucking go there's some explanation on what's going on
1995100	1998561	Alright, let's see, what other fucking housekeeping do I have?
1999401	2002983	Why aren't you fucking following us on Twitter and Facebook and all that stuff?
2003023	2018768	Twitter.com slash OLR, we'll take your fucking Twitter questions later You know, because it is a show where every fucking gamer has a voice Even when that voice is very vulgar We also have our Facebook at Orange Lounge Radio We have a MySpace too, but I haven't logged in there for like fucking three months But I guess I should check on that
2019028	2020730	Yeah, I really should post more
2036403	2061865	I don't know a fucking lot about, but it's Yakuza 3 I haven't really been fucking following this very closely because I didn't really play Yakuza 1 or Yakuza 2 But I still found Dekeman's article very fucking interesting Because Sega made all these fucking localization changes to Yakuza 3 that have people pissed off And I think Dekeman does a very fucking good job of running it down And I'm also just kind of fucking appreciative that there's like actual content on our website besides just the show postings So I'm tipping my fucking hat to Dekeman right fucking now
2062425	2076592	um so yeah and if you want to write stuff for our website get in touch with me you can send me an email rob at orange launch radio.com we're looking for opinions and shit stuff that fits into the fucking every gamer has a voice uh thing so if you're interested drop me an email uh we'll see what we can fucking do
2077936	2078956	and go read Deekman's article.
2078996	2079717	It's pretty fucking great.
2079817	2082760	And Deekman posted, just for you, Jamie, something on Digimon earlier.
2082800	2083660	I don't know if you fucking saw it.
2083700	2085162	Yeah, go to OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
2085242	2086463	I don't know if I can see.
2086663	2087664	It's our own fucking website.
2087824	2088184	Take a look.
2088604	2089785	I've been busy.
2089885	2090946	All right.
2090986	2091867	What else do I want to say?
2092027	2092368	Oh, yes.
2092648	2099453	On OrangeLaunchRadio.com, on the left side, there's a little fucking box that says... I don't even remember what it says, but it's got all the links...
2100434	2102235	I'm a fucking loser tonight.
2102876	2108680	It's where it has all the Twitter icon and the last FM and all the places you can follow us and so forth.
2108760	2109620	Extended Play.
2109660	2110481	That's what it's fucking called.
2110521	2111181	Extended Play.
2111582	2112362	Just look in that box.
2112402	2113923	It's like all the communities we're on.
2114223	2114684	Check that out.
2114764	2116145	A link to the OLR PSP.
2116425	2121068	If you're on a PSP and you have not visited OLRPSP.com, you're fucking missing out.
2121088	2121969	Where the fuck have you been?
2122109	2122709	I know, exactly.
2122789	2124270	Well, I know we get new listeners every week.
2124450	2126792	I haven't fucking updated that in a long time, too.
2126832	2130034	I'm very sorry, by the way, if we have new listeners tonight.
2130434	2154339	I know, honestly This is not normal If this is your first fucking show, you need to realize tonight is a fucking protest We are exercising our first fucking amendment fucking rights Congratulations if you made it this far And keep in mind, normally we are really Rob will say that He will literally say, quote, the F word, end quote Or F that Why am I doing quote fingers?
2154359	2159900	You can't fucking see what I'm doing That makes great fucking radio Bite my fucking ass, please
2161112	2161733	I said it nicely.
2162273	2163074	Please makes it nice.
2163494	2164555	Please makes it very fucking nice.
2165056	2181471	But here's the other thing to keep in mind is that I bet anything there's going to be one of those fucking like podcasts that reviews other podcasts or something or some fucking asshole on his blogs and say, I listen to Orange Lounge Radio and all they did was say fuck because they're just stupid and can't think of anything else to say.
2182112	2183293	They don't know what the fuck they're talking about.
2183313	2185175	Why would you have a fucking podcast review other podcasts?
2185195	2185815	That seems like a...
2187757	2201345	Again, we are protesting the anti-cussing week that our government has seen fit to waste fucking money and time voting upon when we're in the middle of a budget crisis.
2201565	2210391	Students are fucking going out on the freeway and threatening to get fucking run over by cars in protest of how bad the fees have gotten to universities.
2211872	2215554	I'm a student myself and even going to junior college right now is fucking expensive.
2215594	2215654	And
2215814	2222397	Come on, look at how bad the fucking universities are if the students think that that's a good idea, running around on the freeway.
2222677	2225079	Didn't they fucking learn that in, like, preschool?
2225419	2225899	Here's the thing.
2225999	2227640	I think we should have a 60-star 11.
2227740	2239206	What I need the OL Army and the people that get it tonight, you fucking cool kids that are understanding the show tonight, if you see this shit out there on the internet somewhere, fucking tear them a new asshole.
2240046	2255147	because honestly fucking independent people should be supporting each other not tearing each other down I don't fucking talk bad about independent podcasts open fucking season on those that get paid to do it in the core podcast though I will rip them apart but indie podcasts need to fucking help each other out
2255407	2270007	and if I may make my own statement about that and this goes even on an individual basis usually when someone puts down somebody else without giving any constructive feedback it's because they are having issues with themselves low fucking self-esteem leads to bitchiness
2271621	2273242	Sorry, haven't you noticed that?
2273902	2279884	Usually the people who are the loudest or certain people who are anti-gay are usually the closet.
2279904	2280924	I was just fucking thinking that.
2280984	2283745	That happened in our backyard at Main National News.
2283765	2287967	This huge fucking anti-gay Republican piece of shit.
2289387	2291189	There are some cool Republicans, believe it or not.
2291209	2293611	It's just the wrong fucking people are in control of that party right now.
2293651	2295092	Like Meghan McCain, I'm down with her.
2295172	2296253	She is a cool Republican.
2296633	2308663	But idiots like this guy who fucking voted yes on A and then fucking has all this legislation that's fucking anti-gay gets caught at Faces, a gay bar that Jamie and I have fucking gone to several times.
2308683	2310805	This place makes gay look straight.
2311345	2311926	Yeah.
2312826	2328582	I've been there coming back from fucking faces with another guy in his car I mean, anyway, sorry we need to go back and do karaoke at faces that would be a lot of fucking fun I actually did have another point with this is that you know
2330336	2336583	It's not really just the budget crisis that haven't we hit, what is it, somewhere between 14 and 17% statewide unemployment?
2337605	2339187	So people, there's no fucking jobs out there.
2339647	2347196	Yet, instead of doing things, you know, to help people get jobs, to create new programs, they're wasting their time and effort on...
2348457	2371072	safeguarding morality which is an individual choice so to our government right now fuck you in your ear because your ass is not good enough some quick fucking comments from chat hardcore777 says both Republicans and Democrats are corrupt I'd fucking agree with that honestly because the budget crisis we have in this state right now it's everybody's fucking fault
2371712	2372653	I totally agree.
2372733	2377717	I hate going back to the political topic, but this is something that needs to be said.
2378497	2383701	Part of the problem is that we are so stuck in this bipartisan system.
2383721	2388844	I'm sure if you ask anybody, it's even on public sites that say America has a two-party system.
2389065	2389845	That's a fucking lie.
2390405	2392507	We do have independent political parties.
2393308	2397510	It's just the Democrats and the Republicans are the ones with the money to spend on it.
2398591	2400452	and the independents fall to the wayside.
2400552	2403433	You know, that is the reason why I wish that Perot had won.
2405413	2406274	Well, I don't know about you.
2406314	2406894	No, no, no.
2407094	2411135	I'm saying that is... For what he fucking stood for, I get it.
2411195	2411456	I get it.
2411476	2414417	For what he would do for the, I think, morale.
2414457	2416037	He's the one I'd pick, but okay.
2416257	2422759	I'm not saying that he's the one I would have picked, but I'm saying that as an independent who came closer than anyone... To break down the fucking turd wall.
2422779	2422919	Exactly.
2423400	2423900	Exactly.
2425000	2426902	4 years, vote him out.
2427002	2428624	At least business won't be fucked up.
2428644	2429324	He's a businessman.
2430125	2434249	But I'm saying that I would like to see the wall shattered.
2434269	2439593	I'd like to see people break out of their little voting strict Republican because, oh, they're Republican.
2440374	2445339	This is why I get an absentee ballot every fucking year.
2445939	2446780	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
2465485	2465845	I'm sorry
2480555	2481576	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2498658	2521743	podcasts I subscribe to and I unsubscribe from Orange Lounge Radio this week because I find them very annoying and the girl talks too much and the guy's too gay and the other guy's too angry and blah blah blah like just shut the fuck up talk about a podcast you do like nobody reads your fucking blog because you're so fucking negative that's the thing anyhow
2523240	2525660	But as far as I know, the other podcasts are cool.
2525680	2527761	If somebody is talking about us, I don't know yet.
2527801	2530301	But if I find out, it's fucking on.
2530541	2530801	Alright.
2531782	2532082	Anyhow.
2533942	2537002	How about 45 minutes into the show and now some fucking gaming news, right?
2537703	2538003	Loki.
2539063	2541023	Alright, let's get into this.
2541223	2545164	So there's this bug that fucking popped up last week.
2545204	2549625	We thought it was, you know, maybe someone hacking the fucking PlayStation Network or something like that.
2549985	2550845	Which, that's still...
2551545	2558367	Bakes the question, what the hell was that webpage then that said, you know, hey, turn on your fucking Java and your whatever.
2559147	2559988	So I don't know what that was.
2560048	2561788	But anyways, this was completely unrelated.
2561908	2568190	All apparently the, well, most of the fat PlayStation 3s, the old style ones.
2568910	2594451	had trouble connecting to the PlayStation Network due to a bug in one of the ARM chips and apparently this was caused by the PlayStation 3 thinking apparently that it was a leap year when it wasn't and it became unsynced and so because of this date-time desynchronization it was unable to connect to the PlayStation Network as a safety precaution or something.
2596412	2600993	Anyways, within a little amount of time, it was actually fixed.
2601633	2611896	Basically, the only advice they fucking gave was, don't turn your system on because you may lose your trophies and some games may not work and blah, blah, blah.
2612056	2616537	My favorite was how when it was all fucking over, they were like, we fucking fixed it.
2616637	2620698	It's okay to turn on your fucking PlayStations now when they didn't do a goddamn thing.
2620918	2621898	They just waited it out.
2622138	2622658	That's all they did.
2623373	2624733	They didn't fucking fix it.
2625614	2626994	It was a bug in the date.
2627054	2628794	And as soon as the date changed, all better.
2630775	2637137	So somebody fucked up and thought 2010 was a leap year and somehow that made it in the old fucking PlayStations.
2637317	2638657	Here's my fucking problem with that.
2638697	2644699	Apparently those chips were actually the same chips that were in the Zunes.
2645099	2651621	You may not remember the end of 2008, I think, when it switched over into the year.
2651641	2652821	Isn't it like fucking New Year?
2653121	2659566	Yeah, it was like New Year's and all the Zunes stopped working because of the ARM CPU chip and apparently there was a date bug in that too.
2660006	2660527	Oh, guess what?
2660547	2666411	The same chip was actually inside the PlayStation 3 all along and it was a known problem.
2666871	2670073	But they just kind of... Oops!
2670133	2671615	We forgot all about it!
2672035	2673236	You have a Zune.
2673896	2674857	I don't... Didn't...
2675430	2676530	Well, I don't have one anymore.
2676790	2677031	Oh.
2677811	2678371	Times get tough.
2678811	2691055	But yes, I, I mean, you know, you don't really want your whatever to stop working all of a sudden because, oh, we didn't realize there was this bug in here and that's a problem.
2693556	2693876	I don't know.
2694336	2696717	And it doesn't look good when your consoles stop fucking working.
2696737	2697957	The only advice I can give you is,
2698908	2699468	Don't play it.
2728781	2729321	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2749532	2775768	there needs it's very reminiscent of that very controversial Ubisoft DRM that I know we're going to get into later in the show but it just fucking strikes me as like a little hint of that and I do not like that do not fucking want so there's a piece of me that's like Sony doesn't need to fucking fix the date issue Sony needs to fucking fix the I can't play my games online if something is broken on their end issue that's the fucking problem
2775868	2785092	Well, here's the other fucking thing that it's really bad is since they didn't really do anything, I mean, is this actually going to get patched out or like four years from now are we going to run into the same fucking problem again?
2786613	2787713	Oh, don't forget about it.
2787813	2788534	It's okay.
2789694	2790335	Oh, yay.
2790375	2793236	You remember that one time that all those PS3s went fucking down?
2793696	2800379	Yeah, it's going to happen again because it's not a leap year, but try telling that to the PlayStation.
2802200	2804101	It makes whatever year it wants fucking leap.
2805871	2812333	So, uh... Well, is there a fucking possibility this is gonna happen in the future?
2813533	2816214	Um, I don't think it will be, because it'll be probably patched out.
2816414	2817854	Let's put something to ignore it.
2819155	2819395	Alright.
2820335	2830898	Um, in other fucking Sony news, we have news about their fucking motion controller that's been kind of quiet ever since the last E3, but I'm assuming that it's because they're gonna have some fucking new news this year at E3.
2831418	2831878	But, um...
2833345	2835246	PlayStation Arc PlayStation Arc
2862063	2863785	Arc, Augmentive Reality Controller
2883204	2883765	Arc the Lad Games
2906757	2908238	I somehow really fucking doubt that.
2909758	2913299	Or you'll be able to stick two of each animal into that controller.
2913759	2914079	Shut up.
2914740	2917060	Or it will be the fuck controller.
2917301	2918941	How the fuck will that work?
2919381	2921322	Playing fucking Gradius with a motion controller.
2921402	2926163	Do you fucking just flail around to move your fucking ship all around and then pew pew pew with your button?
2926403	2927684	Like I don't fucking understand that.
2927784	2930585	How is Gradius going to incorporate motion control?
2930605	2931225	That makes no sense.
2932097	2934860	Oh, by the way, Becky just alerted me to something.
2935000	2935340	What's that?
2936081	2938623	That Cuss Free Week did not pass the Senate.
2941046	2943047	No, it was on the news and everything.
2945390	2947752	Oh, I'll see if I can get her to send me a link.
2948772	2949352	Maybe there's more.
2949433	2952535	Well, still, still, it doesn't matter because it doesn't matter.
2952595	2959340	The fucking point still stands whether it passed or not because they wasted their fucking time actually voting on this.
2959380	2963883	It's even worse if it didn't fucking pass because then they wasted all that fucking time for fucking nothing.
2963963	2964463	So fuck them.
2966805	2966925	Yeah.
2968456	2969777	Any attack on my freedom speech.
2969797	2973319	I don't know how you would fucking play Gradius with a motion controller.
2973679	2979002	The only thing I could think of is that maybe you control the options that way or something.
2979022	2979702	I don't know.
2981003	2983684	Me, I flail around and knock the ships out of the way.
2983884	2984785	It sounds dumb.
2985445	2988887	I like the name, but the thing sounds dumb.
2989007	2990988	They did pass California Acupuncture Day.
2992829	2993409	What the fuck?
2993930	2996311	I am not even going to try to dignify that one.
2996798	2997518	So, maybe we would see them.
3024605	3025106	and you know what?
3025286	3031191	As soon as I saw the little caption on Destructoid, I had to go grab my game and take a picture.
3032092	3033934	That is a big fucking box for a video game.
3034114	3034435	It is.
3034995	3035856	God bless those video games.
3035916	3037117	Baseball fucking stars.
3037137	3039760	Oh, and by the way, paid 48 bucks for it.
3040480	3040821	Yikes.
3041391	3044133	Yeah, but keep in mind how much we paid for fucking King of Fighters 2000.
3044313	3045154	That's true.
3045174	3048297	Weren't those fucking games like fucking $200 when they first came out?
3048317	3049057	We paid $350 for it.
3050598	3053781	But at the time, all the other sites were selling it for about $400.
3053841	3056123	So we got a really good fucking deal on it.
3057691	3057991	All right.
3058311	3060232	Yeah.
3060732	3066155	Some fucking clarifications in our chatroom because, of course, the chatroom gets all sicked on it and everything.
3066815	3070937	It did fucking pass the assembly, but it was fucking rejected in the Senate.
3071557	3073398	Is there like a high crisis?
3073438	3074619	My point still stands.
3074659	3083823	It was a waste of fucking time no matter what happened and that this was even allowed to get somewhere and that people are fucking listening to this guy and, you know, what they stand for and everything.
3083903	3084043	So...
3084523	3085345	Point still stands.
3085385	3088650	And besides, you all have been wanting a fucking fuck show for like a year and a half.
3088730	3089692	This is a good fucking reason.
3089772	3092877	The joke's been running for like a year and a half, so now's as good of a time as any.
3093297	3093578	All right.
3094079	3094379	Loki.
3095260	3095421	Yes.
3096022	3096743	So, um...
3098601	3099402	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3118379	3138212	and these two studio heads just all of a sudden aren't working there anymore and now more and more information kind of came out about that and apparently it was according to a bunch of lawsuits here because now they're filing lawsuits against Activision
3139793	3141434	for unpaid royalties.
3141914	3157662	Apparently, these guys, you know, they did all their hard work on Modern Warfare 2 or whatever, and Activision wanted them, you know, they were kind of strong-arming them into making, you know, the next Modern Warfare game or whatever, the next war game take place in Vietnam, and...
3158803	3159524	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3188901	3193664	and it says, after all we have given Activision, we shouldn't have to sue to get paid.
3195044	3203869	And of course, Activision, you know, responding to their lawsuit, they say that they're disappointed in the lawsuit and that it's meritless.
3204669	3214321	ActaVision is disappointed that Mr. Zemparella and Mr. West have chosen to file a lawsuit and believes their claims are meritless.
3214461	3220448	Over eight years, ActaVision shareholders provided these executives with their capital they needed to start in Findy Ward.
3220829	3223332	So basically they're saying, hey, we made you, now we can break you.
3223972	3231956	as well as financial support, resources, and creative independence that help them flourish and achieve enormous professional success and personal wealth.
3232177	3237639	Yes, because if they didn't give them money, I'm sure that they couldn't create these wonderful games, is what they're saying.
3239020	3245403	Granted that studios do need money to get going, but I think it's just the creative talent behind it that creates the games.
3245764	3247144	Anyways, it continues.
3247304	3256269	In return, Activision legitimately expected them to honor their obligations to Activision, just like any other executives who hold positions and trust in the company.
3256629	3264473	While the company showed enormous patience, it firmly believes that its decision was justified based on the courses of conduct and actions.
3264533	3264994	Basically...
3265974	3275520	Long story short, they were unhappy with what was going on with Activision, and so the rumor is that they were kind of shopping around elsewhere.
3275540	3279342	They're not the only ones that kind of had their fucking fill of Activision, that's for sure.
3279642	3281823	Can I read this quick comment from chat from Oddfuck?
3281863	3286966	Again, the opinions in our chatroom are not necessarily those of us here on the show, but here's Oddfuck in our chatroom.
3287286	3291949	Bobby Kotek needs to die in a fucking fire with fucking fire ants on his face while everyone fucking pisses on him.
3293530	3294271	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3312688	3333059	you have the fucking all these subsidies of Activision getting shut down all the stuff that's fucking going on now with you know their biggest selling game I mean the Bobby Kotek looks like a fucking buffoon right now like if I were a shareholder I would be demanding some fucking answers and calling for some fucking you know I just think it's
3333519	3358768	They look stupid, and unfortunately, you know, if Infinity War... What it comes down to is if Infinity War ends up, you know, dissolving or whatever, I mean, they'll just move on to... Because they were before, they were behind Medal of Honor and stuff, they were working on that series, and they left to go form, you know, this new company, basically, to, you know, create the Call of Duty series, and the Call of Duty series has been really awesome, but...
3359548	3361609	You know, they're going to be treated like dicks.
3361669	3362270	I mean, come on.
3362570	3366272	Activision's been so awful now that they're making EA look fucking awesome.
3366852	3369353	I want to address some fucking good points in chat.
3369394	3371895	ShadowFuckingRunner says, Rob, are they still making money?
3372235	3373956	And YOIR says, Rob, it doesn't matter.
3374016	3375677	People are still buying their products in droves.
3375937	3377398	The shareholders demand results.
3377718	3381980	Well, hold on, guys, because all this fucking stuff has come out, like, literally within the past couple weeks.
3382020	3388004	And although we've kind of known Activision's going down a shady path for a while, this whole one-two punch I'm talking about is just in the past couple weeks.
3388544	3393669	So I don't mean he's going to fucking get pulled from the board tomorrow.
3394229	3396271	But wait about six months to a year.
3397192	3401596	Wait a little while and see when that next Modern Warfare games comes out.
3401696	3402817	If it's not fucking up to par...
3404144	3404965	Thanks for watching!
3428907	3434109	The whole reason they even take on Brutal Legend, that kind of stuff, and Ghostbusters.
3434689	3440492	Well, we can't figure out a way to pump out a new game every year in this franchise, so we're just not going to take it.
3441192	3442893	And then same with Guitar Hero.
3442913	3445334	I mean, look how they're treating download content and stuff.
3445754	3447054	Very little each month.
3447294	3448215	And look at DJ Hero.
3448275	3448435	What?
3448835	3450035	Wow, two download packs.
3450456	3450876	Thanks.
3451576	3452277	Thanks a lot.
3452557	3453297	Way to support it.
3453978	3455459	I will fucking say this, though.
3455599	3457801	You do have a fucking point that it's about the money.
3458061	3460242	They can do all the fucking dickhead things they want in the world.
3460282	3461203	In the end, it's about the money.
3461964	3477655	But my little butt with that is, or my big butt, depending on whatever you want to look at it as, don't underestimate the gamers and kind of the impact that all that negative press on all the blogs and shit can have.
3478644	3480485	I could be wrong, and that's fucking fine.
3480625	3481945	I think it's going to come down.
3482085	3490309	Unfortunately, it's going to fucking be just like the protests or whatever with Call of Duty, how they were saying, oh, we're protesting this game.
3490329	3491329	We're not going to fucking buy it.
3491909	3493930	And sure enough, everyone's buying it.
3494030	3495971	Or the Left 4 Dead thing.
3495991	3497172	Of course, that's a different company.
3497212	3503434	But still, remember fucking the Left 4 Dead fucking thing on Steam that all the fucking people were playing Left 4 Dead 2?
3504054	3504995	Or they got the screenshot?
3505035	3505155	Yeah.
3505635	3532195	same same story so if you really fucking mean it if you're really fucking you know pissed off that these guys got fired for all their hard work then you need to stop fucking buying the games just stop don't buy the next Call of Duty game it's not going to be an Infinity Ward game anyways I mean that's if you want to wait the way you want to look at it I mean look at they're gonna put Treyarch in you know charge of it and unfortunately Treyarch's just not as good as Infinity Ward I mean people even know that um
3534088	3536028	I just... I don't know.
3537389	3539089	Just, you know, vote with your money.
3539529	3539789	Alright.
3540449	3541810	Let's talk about some fucking titties.
3543230	3544010	How's that sound?
3544050	3544330	Perk?
3545690	3548231	If there's one thing better than freedom of speech, it's nudity.
3548831	3551792	And there's some titties to be found in fucking Heavy Rain.
3552212	3552832	Here's the deal.
3553472	3558173	I won't try to spoil the story too bad, but there is a love scene that happens at one point in the game.
3558493	3562314	You know, it should be fucking obvious if you've seen some of the previous of the game that it kind of pushes the envelope.
3562674	3563655	So there's a love scene.
3564036	3574949	Now, if you decline the kiss and trigger the sequence anyway and reload your saved game right away, then you'll have the female lead running around, titties flapping around.
3576551	3578733	Everything is all just hanging out.
3579054	3579735	So there you go.
3579895	3581717	You can run around and play naked.
3583688	3589330	Now, of course, the naked model was not made in the game to be run around and play naked.
3589790	3592531	But there's a shower scene that happens in the story.
3592571	3593691	Oh, I saw this.
3595672	3602854	What's interesting, here's the fucking part I think is interesting, though, is that, you know, since everybody gets all fucking bent out of shape because of nudity, specifically the ESRB.
3603394	3605776	Is this game going to go back to the board for an AO rating?
3606076	3611219	Isn't this the same fucking thing that happened in Oblivion for the PC version ended up getting pulled and fucking rated AO?
3611519	3623006	Because even though you weren't supposed to be able to ever see the titties, the titties were there because they fucking would use them to base like a sheer top on.
3623226	3639955	I think though that it's still okay because you actually do see that model in the game it's just now that you're using that model for more than just that one scene but isn't I mean for whatever reason I think it's fucking stupid but the the fucks out there that rate things are like there's a big difference between a butt
3640695	3641295	and a pussy.
3642576	3644638	All that is is 180 degrees.
3645118	3656306	If that model wasn't in the game, if it was just like she's behind a shower curtain or something like that and they're just using that model for a silhouette or something, that's different.
3656506	3659848	But you actually use this model in the game for one of the scenes.
3659888	3662189	You actually see her completely naked.
3662650	3666792	If they're going to argue anything, it's going to be fucking duration.
3668053	3670435	Why didn't they just do the Sims pixel thing?
3670835	3671176	Watch.
3671416	3673138	I miss fucking Cleo right here.
3673258	3673598	Watch.
3674138	3687772	Next week on the fucking show, there's gonna be a story about some mother filing a fucking lawsuit against because they fucking found this in the game because their kid read about this on the internet on one of the gaming blogs.
3688132	3693117	So they fucking go in and unlock the character and suddenly mom walks in and there's some fucking titties on the screen.
3693437	3722254	and she fucking loses her shit not knowing that that's the game she bought for her kid and there's a fucking lawsuit next week's show, that'll be a story if not next week, two weeks but the nudity's in the game already it would be just the same as it would be just I'm watching it it would be just the same as if he didn't do this mod or whatever and you know if they didn't do the mod or whatever and just the shower scene it would be exactly the same
3725150	3727852	I hope you're right that there's no basis, but I don't know.
3727912	3729373	Her boobs don't move like real boobs, though.
3729393	3730033	I have a feeling.
3730774	3734396	Well, I don't think you were ever supposed to be able to just fucking walk her around and shit like that.
3734416	3736137	Yeah, uncanny valley my ass.
3737898	3739259	I'm sorry, that does not look real.
3741781	3743002	We need some real looking titties.
3743362	3745343	We need Team Ninja to fix this.
3745383	3751447	We have range of motion in the face, but where is the range of motion in the fucking titties?
3752566	3753907	Not there.
3753987	3757311	DarkSakura's got a fucking new story for us, then we'll get into some fucking release dates.
3758332	3759793	Yes, fucking story.
3760113	3762275	Happy fucking birthday, PlayStation 2.
3762796	3765198	Dude, I totally want someone to make me a PS2 cake.
3766559	3767220	That'd be cool.
3767380	3767600	Anyway.
3769822	3772745	Yeah, ten years ago, PS2 launched in Japan.
3773346	3773706	Yay.
3774667	3775508	I have a Japanese PS2.
3776926	3777246	Me too.
3778007	3779848	I have the first model one and it still works.
3780028	3780888	I bought mine.
3781388	3782869	I don't even know if mine still fucking works.
3782909	3783910	I haven't touched it in years.
3783970	3785010	I bought it a little ways later.
3785050	3789573	I bought it for Beatmania 2DX 6th style because I was fucking addicted to 2DX for a while.
3789613	3795456	I think that's what we got ours for too and that and playing some of the few JRPGs that I had.
3795476	3799959	But some of the fucking cool kids in town, they had their PS2s for 3rd and 4th style.
3800259	3804101	I didn't get on that train until about 6th style was my first fucking Beatmania game.
3804261	3808544	The big thing that gets me on this one is that there actually are people that still use their PS2.
3808864	3811166	There's still PS2 games being released.
3811786	3813828	So we're looking at a 10-year-old system.
3815109	3819392	Isn't that funny that people never fucking believe that the PlayStation 3 has a 10-year life cycle?
3819412	3820893	And people go, that's too fucking long.
3821213	3822013	Look at the PS2.
3822093	3823895	It is still fucking going after 10 years.
3824135	3824375	Yep.
3825316	3826997	So a 10-year life cycle is very viable.
3827017	3830319	It's at the end of its life cycle, but yes, it's still going.
3830379	3831940	So it needs to be put down, you know?
3833141	3834963	So, well, happy fucking birthday, PlayStation 2.
3835443	3838766	Just really fucking quick, just kind of reminiscing a minute here.
3838786	3846412	What would you guys say were some of the important PlayStation 2 moments for you that, like, had an impact on gaming for you?
3847213	3852497	You know, like, as a Final Fantasy fanboy, I think playing fucking Final Fantasy X for the first time was a huge moment for me.
3852517	3853658	I don't know about you guys.
3853738	3855980	What was, like, a huge moment in PlayStation gaming for you?
3856060	3857281	I bet I know Loki's.
3858241	3859002	Grand Theft Auto 3.
3860303	3861964	That was good, but Driver 3.
3863869	3865829	It introduced me to the lowest of the low.
3867070	3867870	The guy game.
3870290	3871171	PS2 for me?
3872171	3873671	Fucking Beatmania 2DX, sorry.
3874071	3880072	When I got my... I remember the day I beat everything on Light 7 in 5th style.
3880632	3881913	I freaking called everybody.
3883173	3884993	And posted it on my live journal.
3885493	3886914	I passed Regulus!
3887534	3888614	I hate Regulus!
3888714	3889874	I passed... No, it wasn't Regulus.
3889914	3892835	It was... What was the Light 7 version of Regulus?
3895237	3897602	I... I... I... Something into the lighter.
3898043	3898605	Right in the light?
3898625	3904959	But no... The... The really fucking hard songs I think were Sync and Regulus, yeah.
3906112	3907413	I don't fucking remember.
3907433	3908673	You know how many fucking years ago that was?
3909613	3910574	That's older than this show.
3910794	3920798	Okay, well, now this is going to bother me, but just the day that I beat everything in Light Seven, though I still haven't done it in Fourth Style because of... No, I did beat that.
3920838	3921978	I beat everything in Fourth Style too.
3922018	3926140	Third Style I didn't because I couldn't beat... The Safari.
3926220	3927421	The Safari, yeah.
3928161	3933503	But still, it was like, that was my squeal, I love the PS2 moment.
3935617	3942611	DJ Synthetic fucking Koniko in our chatroom says Silent fucking Hill, oh my fucking god Yeah, yeah, yeah, Silent Hill 3
3944125	3947826	Oh, FuckDeaf says, I got my PS2 for DDR and Kingdom Hearts.
3947866	3949487	Yeah, Kingdom Hearts is pretty fucking epic.
3949867	3950467	That's for sure.
3950807	3951728	Lots of good comments in our chat.
3951748	3952848	I'm chat.originalsradio.com.
3952928	3954709	YYR says, Boo PS2.
3955129	3955449	Boo.
3955529	3961431	I still dislike you because those of all the people who didn't buy or develop for the Dreamcast because they were waiting for you.
3962751	3966072	FuckingSharan says, Play Shadow of the fucking Colossus.
3967713	3968853	That was a pretty epic game too.
3969273	3969994	Very fucking epic.
3970973	3986177	alright well happy fucking birthday PS2 and for those of you still playing the PS2 you might want to think about upgrading although I will say I do hope that the fucking backwards compatibility comes to the Playstation 3 at some point and I know this is a big fucking wrap around I don't want to dredge dirt mine has it
3986537	3986617	Zero!
3986637	3986777	Zero!
4014142	4015083	Zero.
4015203	4018706	I thought, oh yeah, I'm going to go back and play some Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
4019286	4019466	Nope.
4020027	4020607	We've played a few.
4021428	4022429	I don't remember what, but we have.
4023309	4026532	Actually, Rob, crap.
4026872	4027873	What game was it you said?
4028073	4031416	Oh, you know, it reminded me of a game, a franchise that I wish they'd bring back.
4031936	4032537	Jumping Flash.
4034438	4036140	Could you imagine a PS3 Jumping Flash?
4037008	4037988	That would be fucking crack.
4038188	4038968	That would be epic.
4039128	4039669	You know what else?
4040309	4045750	I've played a lot of games on my Xbox 360 backwards compatibility as well.
4046570	4047590	A whopping zero!
4048070	4048811	None!
4049371	4049931	And you know why?
4049991	4051931	Because I have an Xbox 360.
4052111	4053412	I'm buying new games for it.
4053572	4054972	I've played Halo 2 a few times.
4055592	4056212	Eh, no.
4056712	4058573	We've also used it for a few games.
4058793	4060253	You're so fucking nuts.
4060293	4061953	I did use my PS2 a lot for PS1 games.
4064834	4067816	Mostly for my Japanese one to play my import, so I didn't have to.
4067996	4070317	I might want to go get Shadow of the Colossus again.
4070457	4074380	I play PS1 games on my PS3, but mostly the PSP.
4074600	4080323	What was that one game of the guy with the big fro that we were playing at All Games Lounge?
4083025	4083365	On PS1?
4083565	4085446	On PS1, but it was playing on a PS3.
4086967	4087587	I don't remember.
4087647	4090509	That game was cracked out, but now I can't remember the name of it.
4091434	4091874	I don't remember.
4092294	4093395	That was a long fucking time ago.
4093715	4095635	You really tested my fucking memory on this show, DarkSakura.
4095655	4097076	Or God Hand might be good.
4097316	4098416	But I didn't play that one either.
4098656	4100237	How about some fucking release dates?
4100297	4102938	Let's travel the globe and check out some release dates.
4104038	4106059	I'm sure there's something fucking coming out this week.
4107179	4110240	Something's finally coming out.
4111000	4112641	It'd be fantastic.
4114332	4116454	Thanks for watching!
4136414	4138335	Okay, so other stuff coming out.
4138375	4140637	50 classic games on the DS.
4141058	4143159	Well, I'm thinking that there's games in there somewhere.
4143900	4145401	Resident Evil 5 Gold Edition.
4145521	4148023	It's Resident Evil 5 but better with more stuff.
4148303	4149724	Yay!
4149825	4150525	And slightly cheaper.
4151506	4153427	Sam & Max 2 Beyond Time and Space.
4154528	4156610	Coming out as a compilation on PC and Wii.
4156630	4158752	In case you didn't buy them all separately.
4160394	4175636	uh Colleen on the Nintendo Wii which shares cover art almost with Final not Final Fantasy with uh obsessed much are we yes Final Fantasy Final Fantasy no um
4177102	4179863	Now it shares box art with almost Silent Hill.
4180763	4184664	And it looks Silent Hill-ish, maybe, but it's not.
4185444	4187564	Photo Showdown for the DSi.
4187604	4189124	That's right, DSi, not DS.
4189665	4199547	It's a game sort of like Monster Rancher, except you use the pictures that you take with your DSi camera, and based on the colors that are in there, it creates different monsters.
4199847	4203667	Not quite as cool as, you know, putting random CDs in your PlayStation 2.
4203767	4204948	Or the barcode scanner.
4205148	4206388	Or the barcode scanner, yes, that's true.
4208149	4209591	Yeah, we need to bring back the barcode scanners.
4210492	4213196	Assassin's Creed 2 coming on PC this week.
4214337	4215378	Wait a second.
4216200	4217201	I'm confused.
4219196	4219676	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4244204	4244945	The Daring Game for Girls
4263663	4265865	What, like pillow fights and braiding each other's hair?
4266365	4267066	Something like that.
4267486	4268067	Count me out.
4269288	4278556	Yakuza 3, coming out on PlayStation 3, and this of course is a game that's getting lots of controversy for stuff that they've localized and removed.
4279356	4283140	Apparently people like their Japanese trivia and bar hostesses.
4284241	4284341	Um...
4285882	4291985	And then, of course, later on this week, BlazBlue Calamity Trigger coming to PSP.
4292205	4293306	That's going to be pretty awesome.
4294466	4301350	On PC, Warhammer 40K Dawn of War 2, the Gold Edition, kind of a re-release compilation of those games.
4301770	4306653	And then also the new expansion will be coming out for that, Dawn of War 2 Chaos Rising.
4307593	4314458	Um, if you want some real-time strategy on your 360 coming from Square Enix, Supreme Commander 2 will be making its way out in 360.
4314898	4319081	Um, on the DS, Spectral Force Genesis finally coming out.
4320302	4334051	And, uh, about a week from today, we get our Pokemans with, uh, Pokemon SoulSilver and Pokemon HeartGold, each coming with a stupid pedometer because, guess what, Nintendo wants you to fucking exercise, including Pokemon trainers.
4334071	4335031	And that's it.
4335051	4336132	Um,
4336332	4340577	All right, it's a pretty fucking busy week in Japan, which is good because they've had a lot of slow weeks lately.
4340637	4342279	So a lot of fucking releases for you guys.
4342579	4344862	A lot of fucking price drops on the 360 in Japan.
4345162	4347725	BlazBlue, Dream Club, Dead Rising.
4347745	4349527	It's BlazBlue, not BlazBlue.
4349547	4351169	I always say BlazBlue.
4351209	4352090	Where is the fucking E?
4352370	4353171	It doesn't need one.
4353211	4353892	It's stylistic.
4354732	4378907	BlazBlue It's marketing Fine Then fucking spell the game name right in the future BlazBlue, Dead Rising, Dream Club, Halo Wars, Lost Planet Colonies, Otomedia's Gorgeous All of those fucking games getting price drops in Japan this week on the 360 Some new games coming out as well including Red Seeds Profile Which kind of looks like a Silent Hill-ish kind of game It takes place in a remote village but this time in Canada It's supposed to be like 150 people there
4380268	4409564	and then they find a body and it's about the killer in the rain, da da da, and you're an FBI agent, so I don't know if it's like their answer to Heavy Rain or what, but it kind of just looks like one of those scary thriller type of games, so that is on 360 this week, and then another game called Akatsuki no Amanika To Aikaijin comes out this week as well it's one of those cute girl comedy type games, it's not like a dating sim but it's just kind of like one of those adventure games with cute little anime girls in bikinis and all that stuff, so
4410304	4411565	Super fan service there on the 360.
4412726	4414007	Probably won't come out to America.
4414127	4414767	There's a game.
4414787	4415608	Super fan service.
4415908	4416808	Super fan service.
4417629	4428996	On the PlayStation 3 this week, Blaze Blue also gets a price reduction there, as well as Initial D Extreme Stage.
4429596	4435980	Red Seed's profile makes its way out as well in Japan, and Battlefield Bad Company 2 also comes out in Japan.
4436000	4439422	Does that mean you have to wage battle with the band Bad Company?
4439997	4441298	Thanks for watching!
4455607	4461209	Summon Night Grand Thesis, Horobi no Ken to Yakusuku no Kishi.
4461289	4463070	Fuck, they have some long names for games out there.
4463490	4465391	It's an RPG game on the PlayStation 2.
4466711	4469172	Again, looks very anime-heavy influenced.
4469492	4471953	Multi-hit combos, though, in some of the sequences.
4471993	4477795	Some really kind of pretty-looking DVD-ish style cutscenes in a very anime style.
4478675	4482877	Looks like, although it's RPG, it might be a little bit action-based in its battles there.
4483337	4488076	You know, they need to have more games with the word Grand Thesis in the title.
4490430	4491231	What the fuck ever.
4491331	4491611	All right.
4492351	4492751	Let's see.
4492912	4494613	Other games coming out this week.
4494633	4496254	I'm checking the fucking handhelds real quick.
4496654	4505119	Sony PSP gets Battle Spirits Hero Soul, Shin Sangoku Mosu Multi-Raid 2, Zetai Hero Kaizu Kekiaku.
4505399	4507540	All of those fucking games are out in Japan this week.
4507640	4509922	Also out this week, Eye of Judgment Legends.
4510482	4511823	Not in Japan, though, but that's in Asia.
4511883	4513344	Those are all on the fucking Sony PSP.
4513424	4518227	And I just need to fucking remind everybody that is not part of the deal because the game makes sense.
4518687	4520869	On a PSP because there's no camera peripheral.
4521870	4522150	All right.
4522350	4529455	And on the Nintendo DS, one really big game this week, fucking worth noting, RPG Tsukuru DS.
4530176	4532878	It's an RPG maker game on the Nintendo DS.
4533058	4536140	So a lot of folks I know really are into those games.
4536160	4536781	That's kind of cool.
4536821	4538582	Well, unfortunately, it's very Japanese heavy.
4538682	4544226	So you're going to have to know your Japanese if you want to fucking play this game or you're going to need to beg somebody to localize it.
4544347	4545988	EnterBrain is putting it out in Japan.
4546528	4547369	I don't know.
4547429	4549110	I don't think I know that company over here.
4549791	4559477	By the way, although it's technically next week, I should point out the DS releases are thinning out a little bit because next week is Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver are on their way on the Nintendo DS.
4559537	4561099	We know everybody fucking loves Pokemon.
4561999	4562620	So there you go.
4562700	4563901	That's it for Japan.
4564001	4565362	DarkSakura, what the fuck for UK?
4566554	4568635	Oh, a few fucking odds and ends.
4569055	4570515	Final Fantasy XIII on the 9th.
4571036	4573417	On the 10th, Scrap Metal for Xbox 360.
4573577	4577918	12th is Benton Alien Force Viljax Attacks.
4577958	4578718	What the fuck is that?
4579919	4583780	Last Rebellion, Warhammer 40k, Dawn of War 2, Chaos Rising.
4584380	4585441	Boo, Warhammer!
4585541	4588202	Okay, you know what my problem with Warhammer is.
4588882	4589602	And Yakuza 3.
4590823	4591803	That's all the fuck there is.
4594594	4597855	Alright, some more fucking news in the Classic Game of the Week.
4597995	4602876	Everybody fucking loves the Classic Game of the Week, and I'm sure DarkSakura picked a pretty fucking good one this week.
4602936	4603696	She usually does.
4604057	4605957	But just a few more stories before we get there.
4606537	4609018	I know you could all use a break to wash your mouths out with soap.
4610238	4615219	There's been some interesting fucking updates to the game Portal.
4616160	4617820	This week they had a couple updates.
4617920	4619161	Did you see the cover of Game Informer?
4619441	4619881	Yes, I did.
4621541	4623082	Jumping ahead of me here.
4624722	4632645	So the first update that was out there was a patch that added some more radio dialogue, I guess.
4633365	4637187	And there were some different messages that were in Morse code.
4637687	4642769	Also some encoded messages with the numbers and equations in them.
4643489	4648352	And this was all part of the radio that you would hear every now and then.
4648633	4650974	I think it was also in the room that you started off in.
4652675	4654616	And it was all kind of hinting different things.
4655337	4664322	Now, the people that looked at those images or whatever that was in the little radio messages, it's kind of funny.
4664643	4670006	They actually found a phone number for a BBS account.
4670286	4673788	You know, those old things prior to the internet.
4673808	4675870	I fucking loved BBS, dude.
4676270	4681453	The Pit, fucking Trade Wars 2002, or was it 2020?
4681713	4682173	I don't remember.
4682233	4684115	But, you know, all those fucking games were amazing.
4684575	4686476	Legend of the Red fucking Dragon, enough said.
4686756	4693083	And then on, of course, those BBSs, they found ASCII art featuring some stuff.
4693484	4697448	Looks like different robots and whatever from possibly Portal 2.
4699070	4700191	Very interesting looking.
4700352	4700532	Some...
4701653	4707675	Apparently this is going to be some sort of ARG type of thing, so that'll be kind of neat.
4707715	4711096	Oh god, I just realized not all our chatters know what a BBS is.
4711196	4712097	God, I feel old.
4712137	4714218	Alright, I'm really fucking sorry for not explaining it.
4714278	4721000	But BBS is, okay, back before there was the internet, or if you want to get technical, the internet existed then, but it was only for fucking government people and stuff.
4721420	4748580	so back when like I was in fucking high school and probably about the time it's a bulletin board system yeah but you would have to dial in with a modem some guy would fucking host it on their computer or gal and you would dial in on your modem and connect to it and then it was kind of like it had forums and a lot of the stuff that you kind of see in a new forum on the internet today but you know it was a very community type of thing you didn't usually talk to people because you know people didn't want to call long distance and run up their phone bills so it was a very local thing usually
4749229	4749889	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4766214	4772298	You know, they had shareware, which is, you know, kind of like a little... Take you 45 minutes to download the fucking Wolfenstein 3D demo.
4772318	4774520	Yeah, like a demo, you know, for a game.
4774600	4779663	Not really even a demo for a game, but it'd be like the first episode for a game would be like about five bucks or whatever.
4779703	4788069	You would go, you know, buy a floppy disk from, you know, whatever retailer, and you would have the first... It'd be a full game, but it wouldn't be like the full, full game.
4788089	4792032	You'd actually go buy, you know, a retail game, but it'd give you a really good idea of what the game was like.
4792752	4799297	and, you know, you could go on these servers and sometimes they would host the full version of the game and you could download it for free.
4799797	4812786	Or, like, you know, I would download, you know, back before MP3s, you know, mod files and stuff like that, you know, different electronica, you know, synthesized Amiga music files and stuff like that.
4813646	4814247	Mods.
4814647	4816188	So they would have, you know, all sorts of stuff.
4816228	4818069	And I remember actually the first time that there was MP3s.
4818189	4819610	I was like, holy shit, what's an MP3?
4819630	4821912	So that was kind of cool.
4823233	4831358	Back in the day, you used to go on there and sometimes they'd also have it where you could host multiplayer Doom games online and stuff like that.
4831378	4832639	I remember that.
4833000	4833780	Doom 2 online.
4833840	4839044	This was back in the day with... This was all that we had.
4839544	4840625	It was not the internet.
4840665	4846129	It was like, which BBS can you get into and what cool files do they have on there?
4846149	4850272	I had to download them in the Y protocol or the Z protocol, X protocol...
4851877	4852617	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4877629	4879731	But, you know, the PC had a lot of support for it, too.
4879811	4883073	They had, like, S3M, which is, like, Scream Tracker.
4883313	4884915	Basically, it's tracker things.
4885515	4892940	Like, it was like MIDI, where in the MIDI you trigger, you know, different instruments that are hard-coded into your sound card.
4895302	4903946	Well, mods, what they were is it was basically different sample files, like WAV files that you put in there, and it was triggered like MIDI was.
4904026	4913990	So you would have, like, you know, people could record their voice, record, like, actual guitars and stuff like that, and it would be triggered, and you could create, you know, electrical music or electronic music with that.
4915615	4918616	Alright, anything else you wanted to say about Portal before we go to the next story?
4918636	4922838	Anyways, yeah, so to get back into Portal, yeah, there's some pretty cool stuff coming out.
4924178	4929821	They also added an extended ending to Portal, which kind of made it creepy.
4930261	4938184	You may remember, if you finish the game, and a lot of people have, you end up kind of outside while the whole lab kind of...
4938764	4939664	Yeah, for your party.
4961204	4962685	S-Corp Party Position
4984331	4987874	And of course, it was already confirmed by Game Informer.
4987934	4989715	Their cover is actually Portal 2.
4990376	4998803	And it shows, kind of, looks like Aperture Science was just like all these vines and stuff growing from the outside, kind of in through portals and stuff like that.
4999204	5008251	What's going to be kind of unique about it, the game will be coming out on PlayStation, or not PlayStation, PC, Xbox 360, and Mac platforms.
5009032	5011174	And it will be two-player co-op.
5012805	5016547	And it's going to have some interesting looking things in there.
5017128	5017528	Nice.
5018829	5019309	Alright.
5019329	5021971	If you want to learn more about that course, check out the latest game form.
5022571	5028855	Well, in other first-person shooter news, if you still can't fucking tear yourself away from Halo 2, you don't have much time left.
5028955	5029615	It's still coming.
5029695	5030516	April 15th.
5030596	5031536	Sorry, guys.
5031596	5036840	Your attempts to try and fucking change your mind haven't worked because they are shutting it down April 15th.
5037660	5038641	Thank you for watching!
5053049	5067772	3 months of Xbox Live Gold and 400 Microsoft Points Now if you think, oh shit I should run online and play Halo 2 real quick Sorry, you're probably not going to get it now They probably did it for people that had played X number of hours in the past month But
5068492	5071075	Still kind of pretty fucking cool of Microsoft to do, I suppose.
5071135	5073617	It's better than what they're required to do, which is nothing.
5074137	5082705	So I'm sure there's a lot of people that are going to be fucking happy that they can get some bonuses there if they're not too fucking pissed off about Halo 2 going away.
5083165	5084006	So there you go.
5085387	5091550	What would be really fucking nice of Microsoft to do would be to just say, you know, if you want to run your own private servers, here you go.
5091590	5094032	But I guess you can't really do that on the Xbox 360.
5094552	5096914	And Halo 2 is not going away on the PC.
5097034	5097954	Something to remember.
5098074	5103818	So if you really want to cling to your Halo 2 for dear life, remember you can't always play on the PC.
5104989	5105569	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5130098	5133180	Um, in Europe, it was called Grisor.
5134360	5136321	And, um, it was put up by Konami.
5136502	5138843	It was originally on the arcade and came out for the NES.
5139763	5142225	Which, for the PAL region, came out as Probotector.
5143805	5145046	Excuse me, I burped on the mic.
5145366	5148368	Um, and it also came out for the MSX, too.
5148488	5149388	And there are a bunch of sequels.
5149789	5152010	Because, I mean, who doesn't remember Super C, right?
5154114	5161859	Um, so basically you are these guys called Bill and Lance who work for Red Falcon and are trying to stop an alien invasion.
5162059	5166061	And Bill and Lance like to run around with no shirts on and carrying big guns.
5168002	5169043	They wear vests, Rob.
5169343	5169523	Vests.
5169543	5170984	Not in the game.
5171044	5171805	And wear headbands.
5172985	5173326	They do.
5173506	5174586	I can't help it if it's hot.
5177888	5178709	It's not about fucking.
5179778	5181840	So yeah, you can get a whole bunch of different guns.
5181960	5189325	You get a machine gun, a laser gun, a fire gun, a spread gun, rapid fire power-up, all kinds of different fun stuff.
5189985	5205716	And then you also, besides having the typical side-scrolling levels, you also have a behind-the-back sort of 3D maze level where you have to go in a certain order and go through the bases, defenses, and get to the end.
5205776	5207117	And it's really fucking hard!
5208416	5209596	I mean, seriously, it's hard.
5210076	5220439	If you don't use the Konami code and have somebody else playing with you and you can beat this game without dying, I want to meet you and have you sign my arm or something.
5220819	5230161	YYR in chat is trying to show off his big fucking skills saying, cleared both Contra and Super C on NES without 10 or 30 lives and without continues.
5230241	5230641	Who else?
5230681	5231402	Yeah, but did you die?
5233322	5234903	I want to meet the person who can do it without dying.
5235483	5236563	Can't Dan do it without dying?
5237824	5238845	No, actually.
5238925	5240206	Oh, I fucking thought he could.
5240246	5241467	I thought that's why you fucking married him.
5241848	5244250	No, it was our type that he could beat without dying.
5244310	5245011	Ah, gotcha.
5246132	5250696	It also came out on the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC.
5250936	5253078	By the way, I need to ask you about Commodore 64 stuff, Rob.
5255120	5256021	I fucking love the Commodore 64.
5256261	5257462	Do you have a good emulator?
5258697	5260499	I haven't used one in a long time.
5260719	5263621	I'm hoping the game room is going to bring back some of the C64 stuff.
5263861	5265723	Because Wii's done a pretty shitty job.
5265743	5266463	It's for someone else.
5267204	5270626	Oh, okay.
5270707	5272728	Those versions all came out in Europe in 1988.
5274549	5277792	The IBM PC version was also out in Germany.
5279253	5283957	The Commodore 64 and IBM versions later came out in North America as Contra.
5284997	5289742	Um, but yeah, the NES version was evil and hard.
5290182	5293846	And it was one of the earliest games to use the Konami code.
5294566	5299391	Which, um, one of the other games that did it was, you know, before that was, of course, Gradius.
5300732	5308759	Um, and for the Falmicon, it used a multi-memory controller that, um, uh...
5310534	5314757	and Konami made for the Japanese market that gave it additional graphical effects.
5314777	5322141	So I don't know if anyone's ever played ROM of this, but if you play the Japanese ROM, there's animation in the background and other stuff going on.
5322321	5326783	The leaves are moving and the grass is blowing in the wind and all kinds of fun stuff.
5327744	5339271	And it also had extra cheat codes like a stage select and a sound test and hidden post-credits scene that you would hold select and start before and during the entire end credits.
5340692	5346163	And yeah, like I said, the European version was called Probotector and the main guys were turned into robots.
5347385	5349870	And it was just because of censorship laws in the day.
5350411	5351192	Fuck censorship.
5352160	5357904	But when Contra Legacy of War and Shattered Soldier came out, they retained the Contra name.
5359965	5366669	MSX2 was actually fairly different than the arcade and the NES version because of limitations in the hardware.
5367489	5369811	It didn't scroll, but it used flip screens.
5370491	5372472	Sort of the way that Metal Gear and Vampire Killer did.
5373273	5374473	And it was only single player.
5375814	5382198	However, it did change the last 10 stages of the game.
5382678	5387241	And the MSX2 version of Contra is on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan.
5387261	5389362	It came out on February 2nd of this year.
5390383	5394065	Of course, there was a PS2 re-release version for Xbox Live Arcade.
5395045	5396606	Digital Eclipse handled the conversion.
5396706	5400669	There's Konami Classics Series Arcade hits for the DS.
5401029	5401970	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
5402450	5402530	Um...
5404271	5420023	and you can actually get the Konami's Collector Series Castlevania and Contra for Windows in North America which also includes Super C and 3 Castlevania games and if you get Contra 4 Contra and Super C is also included that's the DS
5420723	5421203	So, yeah.
5421664	5422544	Pretty freaking hard.
5425205	5427627	And, of course, there were a ton of Contra games that came after.
5427667	5431769	There was Super Contra.
5431789	5434730	Well, Super C. It was Super Contra overseas.
5434770	5435711	It was Super C here.
5437352	5439353	Operation C for the Game Boy.
5439393	5441574	Contra 3, The Alien Wars for Super NES.
5441994	5443095	Contra Force for NES.
5443575	5447297	Contra Hardcore, which that's really actually kind of hard, too, on Genesis.
5448197	5448277	Um...
5451598	5452759	I love the Super Nintendo one.
5453079	5453679	That was awesome.
5454639	5459600	Konami contracted out for PlayStation Contra Legacy of War, which also came out on the Saturn.
5460660	5462180	See the Contra Adventure in 1998.
5463661	5468282	2000, we had Contra Shattered Soldier and Neo Contra.
5468722	5470762	Contra 4 came out on the Nintendo DS.
5471402	5475123	And Contra Rebirth by M2 came out for WiiWare.
5475894	5479796	Our old fucking pal Kiriyamaoka did the music for Shattered Soldier, if I remember right.
5479816	5480296	Yes, he did.
5481277	5487700	And also, if you were looking for any of the soundtracks from the arcade version of Contra, the soundtrack is included on Konami Game Music Vol.
5487720	5489621	4, Ajax, which came out in 1988.
5489782	5493063	There's actually a vinyl version of that, Rob.
5494164	5495124	That's fucking old.
5495625	5495885	Yeah.
5497025	5498026	So, yeah, Contra.
5499435	5503699	Alright, fucking great choice, and the chatroom's very fucking pleased with that.
5503779	5506181	Contra is your classic game of the week.
5506461	5513386	Also, I totally recommend watching the Angry Nintendo Nerd, or Angry Gamer Nerd, his review of Contra.
5513847	5514948	It's freaking hilarious.
5515408	5517710	Alright, we're going to take a quick fucking break.
5517730	5522594	We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio in just a little bit, so fucking don't go anywhere.
5523154	5523875	We'll be right back.
5537150	5542479	Perhaps one of the most interesting words in the English language today is the word, fuck.
5543627	5550112	Out of all of the English words that begin with the letter F, fuck is the only word that is referred to as the F word.
5550953	5552754	It's the one magical word.
5553255	5557598	Just by its sound can describe pain, pleasure, hate, and love.
5558499	5565125	Fuck, as most words in the English language, is derived from German, the word frichen, which means to strike.
5565985	5569428	In English, fuck falls into many grammatical categories.
5570148	5573811	As a transitive verb, for instance, John fucked Shirley.
5574832	5577393	As an intransitive verb, Shirley fucks.
5578354	5580035	Its meaning is not always sexual.
5580376	5584358	It can be used as an adjective, such as, John's doing all the fucking work.
5585524	5589087	As part of an adverb, Shirley talks too fucking much.
5590068	5594632	As an adverb enhancing an adjective, Shirley is fucking beautiful.
5595593	5597995	As a noun, I don't give a fuck.
5598676	5603320	As part of a word, abso-fucking-lutely or infucking-credible.
5604021	5608425	And as almost every word in a sentence, fuck the fucking fuckers.
5609574	5613195	As you must realize, there aren't too many words with the versatility of fuck.
5613895	5620157	As in these examples describing situations such as fraud, I got fucked at the used car lot.
5620898	5622778	Dismay, aw fuck it.
5623559	5626339	Trouble, I guess I'm really fucked now.
5627160	5629520	Aggression, don't fuck with me buddy.
5630381	5633802	Difficulty, I don't understand this fucking question.
5634702	5636743	Inquiry, who the fuck was that?
5637723	5638704	Dissatisfaction.
5639365	5641326	I don't like what the fuck is going on here.
5642207	5642928	Incompetence.
5643468	5644509	He's a fuck off.
5645430	5646051	Dismissal.
5646771	5649854	Why don't you go outside and play hide and go fuck yourself?
5650815	5653317	I'm sure you can think of many more examples.
5654238	5659722	With all of these multi-purpose applications, how can anyone be offended when you use the word?
5660563	5665547	We say, use this unique, flexible word more often in your daily speech.
5666187	5669530	It will identify the quality of your character immediately.
5670451	5672592	Say it loudly and proudly.
5673593	5674474	Fuck you!
5678084	5688796	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this very special edition in celebration of our State Assembly wasting their fucking time passing a resolution to celebrate No Cussing Week.
5688876	5693001	Even if it did fail in the Senate, it's still a waste of fucking everybody's time.
5693061	5693862	Hey, DarkSakura.
5695264	5697426	Why don't you go play hide and go fuck yourself?
5697706	5698227	That's okay.
5699980	5700640	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5715290	5718111	By the way, I hear we're on against the fucking Oscars tonight.
5718511	5724933	I mean, who gives a fuck about a bunch of Hollywood people, uppity fucks, just sucking each other's dicks and giving each other awards.
5725413	5737057	I forgot to submit my Oscar picks for a... Okay, so at my work we have this Oscar pool that we fucking do every year, and every fucking year I forget to submit them.
5737857	5738597	I had it done.
5738977	5740638	My co-worker fucking reminded me.
5741718	5743719	I get home like, God damn it.
5744199	5745779	I fucking forgot them again on my desk.
5745859	5747240	It's not that fucking hard this year.
5747760	5750281	All my picks so far have been worse.
5751001	5751801	Like, damn it!
5752041	5753522	It's a two fucking movie race.
5753562	5755262	Even though they upped it to ten, it's two.
5755322	5755862	Who cares?
5756002	5757463	Who cares about the Oscars?
5757503	5758343	Hurt Locker's gonna win.
5758383	5759323	Doesn't matter.
5759904	5760684	Doesn't fucking matter.
5761244	5762545	And besides, you don't have to fucking watch it.
5762565	5763806	Just read it on the internet later.
5763846	5765287	It's like four hours of bloated bullshit.
5765307	5767149	Do what I do with American Idol results shows.
5767329	5768049	You don't watch them.
5768089	5769791	You just fucking read who wins.
5770491	5770651	Or loses.
5770671	5771972	Because they waste all the fucking time.
5772173	5772713	Well, loses.
5772733	5773233	That's what I meant.
5773594	5773954	All right.
5776016	5778478	YYR is like, oh, but what are they wearing?
5778638	5779779	OMG, look at that gown.
5779839	5780619	It's so daring.
5780679	5782020	Look at how much skin they're bearing.
5782040	5784742	Yeah.
5786149	5792251	It'll all be on fucking Perez Hilton and Oh No They Didn't and the OMG blogs, all the fashion shit.
5792331	5793511	Tiger Claw's been keeping me updated.
5793531	5794171	For those that care.
5794851	5795051	What?
5795211	5797112	Oh, sending you private messages or something?
5797352	5797552	Yeah.
5799392	5801253	You really, you fucking care about the Oscars?
5801493	5803053	I care to see what Star Trek wins.
5804134	5806914	It's only going to win makeup because that was the only thing it was nominated for.
5806954	5809615	But that is the first win for a Star Trek movie.
5810576	5811376	Oh, I didn't know that.
5811576	5815638	I thought even fucking Nemesis got nominated at least for like visual effects.
5815698	5816578	Like I said, the first win.
5816858	5817118	I see.
5817619	5817839	I see.
5818379	5821880	But actually, I do have to agree that Avatar did deserve Best Cinematography.
5823681	5824681	What the fuck ever.
5824761	5826482	Let's get to some fucking video game news.
5826582	5826842	Loki.
5828064	5833226	Yes, let's talk about some fucking sequels, including Scribblenauts 2.
5833586	5838928	That's right, coming from the fucking source for Nintendo news, Nintendo fucking power.
5839948	5846170	There will be another Scribblenauts game, and how can they fucking put out another one, you may ask, because there were so many words that were in there before.
5846190	5849671	Maybe because the first fucking game sold like fucking hotcakes.
5849691	5850932	I mean, it was a huge DS game.
5851252	5852553	Well, here's how they're going to fucking do it.
5852634	5855396	They're going to add 10,000 more words.
5855436	5856738	That's right.
5857298	5857619	10,000 words.
5857639	5859541	That's fucking more than 9,000.
5860322	5861883	That's over 9,000 words.
5863985	5867469	Just giving the... They were missing fucking 9,000 words before.
5867489	5867889	Apparently.
5867909	5869951	They're going to be all internet memes this time.
5871391	5871631	Baby Cthulhu
5884761	5895354	Baby Cthulhu, you scare the shit out of me Over 9,000 It'll deliver 120 new levels, a level editor, a new hint system, and improved controls
5903689	5906830	Well, better have improved controls because those controls sucked.
5907610	5910230	So, how about actual controls first?
5910830	5913171	Another not-too-surprising sequel.
5913211	5915091	In fact, I've known about this for a little bit.
5915711	5923793	SOCOM 4 being announced for PlayStation 3 by Zipper, the company that developed it the last time around for SOCOM Confrontation.
5923813	5929874	But this is an actual sequel this time, and apparently it's going to deliver 14 missions with about...
5930394	5942478	12 hours of gameplay, and of course, you know, the developer has a pretty good track record when it comes to multiplayer games, seeing as they were behind MAG, which had 256 players.
5943198	5948460	However, the game will only have 32-player online multiplayer.
5950201	5953022	And then, and this is great, apparently...
5954085	5961032	At the 11th hour, Ubisoft has made some emergency changes to their DRM on their PC titles.
5962573	5964075	Great topic for the fuck show.
5964215	5973164	Apparently, there was some fixes that needed to be made because people were figuring out how to crack it.
5974705	5975366	And of course...
5977133	5991698	They've already cracked it, but Ubisoft says that players should... Should players lose their internet connection, a requirement under the company's ridiculous new DRM scheme, their single-player offline game would drop upon reloading.
5991738	5996619	You'd be left with your last checkpoint and not the actual point you were cut out on.
5996899	6002281	Now, their claim is that, no, the DRM has not been broken.
6002401	6002781	In fact...
6003061	6008712	Those who are playing the cracked version out there aren't getting the full game experience.
6009333	6014624	In other words, they're not getting access to the Uplay stuff, which no one gives a shit.
6015647	6031511	And to kind of go along with this, in kind of the worst case scenario situation, well, the worst case scenario situation happened, and apparently their servers went offline, their Ubisoft DRM authentication servers.
6031891	6033231	They've been down, and guess what?
6033871	6038813	Apparently people that had Assassin's Creed 2 can't play it right now.
6039473	6040013	Don't!
6041903	6069831	I smell a fucking class action lawsuit and apparently yes and it's been down for quite a long time and there's been people trying to log in for like 25 minutes and they're unable to do anything and a Noobisoft representative apparently responded to the forum thread that's over on the official Assassin's Creed 2 forum and saying clearly the extended downtime and lengthy login issues are unacceptable particularly as I've been told these servers are constantly monitored
6070951	6073454	Well, they apparently watched them go down.
6073474	6074855	Well, you fucked that up, didn't you?
6074935	6075856	I'm honoring them!
6076057	6076737	Crushing!
6078159	6084306	And then they added, I'll do what I can to get more information on this issue.
6084666	6088230	And here's more on what the issue is.
6088270	6092695	First thing tomorrow, push for a resolution and assurance that this won't happen again in the future.
6094196	6094897	It doesn't matter.
6095417	6096518	They've already cracked it.
6097218	6097959	Forget about it.
6098179	6104304	Because what apparently happened is there was a cracker group out there that figured out that, hey, guess what?
6104404	6116975	They have some sort of failsafe in the case that Ubisoft decides to go out of business that they'll put out a patch that will apparently disable this DRM so that you can play your game just fine.
6117275	6117755	Well, guess what?
6117795	6120277	The code's in there, and they've activated it, so...
6122039	6122780	Thanks, Ubisoft.
6122800	6123360	You made it easy.
6128045	6129607	We all knew this was going to fucking happen.
6130227	6130468	Uh-huh.
6131148	6132550	And we all knew it's a stupid idea.
6132730	6133350	And guess what?
6133811	6134692	It's a stupid idea.
6136471	6137612	Is it a fucking stupid idea?
6137712	6138913	It's a fucking stupid idea.
6139494	6143797	It's the worst idea ever because all you're doing is punishing the people that legitimately paid for the program.
6144098	6147580	The people that want to hack it, they're going to wait for a hacked version to come out.
6148121	6153325	I don't think there's a PC title out there that they haven't figured out a way around some sort of DRM for it.
6154646	6155027	Oh well.
6156488	6157109	You tried.
6157329	6157909	You failed.
6158089	6160752	Maybe you shouldn't try because it costs money to try.
6162290	6167333	All right, so a lot of fucking confusion going on over a highly fucking controversial game, Six Days in Fallujah.
6167353	6169955	You might remember this game was supposed to fucking come out, and then it doesn't.
6169995	6171997	Like, wasn't fucking Konami actually supposed to put it out?
6172037	6172917	Yeah, Konami was putting it out.
6172937	6175239	And then they were like, no, we don't want to fucking be associated with this.
6175259	6179201	Because they're working with terrorists or something, and they were also working with the soldiers that were there.
6179221	6181203	But that wasn't going to fucking stop Atomic Games.
6181243	6184045	Apparently IGN reported this week that...
6184805	6185706	Thanks for watching!
6214462	6218310	So keep an eye on Atomic Games, I suppose, if you really want more information on this game.
6218351	6218992	Although I don't know.
6220476	6224024	You know that old saying, strike when the iron is hot?
6225666	6229747	Yeah, well, it's like, you know, the air is frozen, put away.
6231588	6240131	Anyhow, on some other fucking news, if you still are one of these people that don't have a fucking Wii for some reason, Walmart can sell you the bundle that everybody fucking thought would be out already.
6240731	6248534	Walmart is selling a Wii, a Nintendo Wii, Wii Sports, Wii Sports Resort, and the Motion Plus attachment.
6248634	6249875	It's available right now.
6249895	6251175	$199 is the price for this.
6254873	6258735	So basically it's a normal Wii thing with Wii Sports Resort with it.
6258775	6265879	Which, you know, although Walmart, I don't know, they can kind of be fucking shady about some things like, I don't know, censorship on albums.
6266579	6268360	A good deal is still a good deal.
6268460	6271342	And if you do not have a Nintendo Wii for whatever reason, you want the whole thing.
6271362	6274523	It'll be in limited supplies as if the supplies aren't limited enough already.
6274723	6274963	Yeah.
6275464	6275584	So.
6276644	6303998	and one other fucking thing I have for you guys before I turn it over to DarkSakura Tecmo Bowl there is a new Tecmo Bowl coming it's a new old Tecmo Bowl it's a fucking throwback I am actually fucking excited about this I don't talk a lot about sports games on this show because I don't fucking play a lot of them because I know it's going to sound weird but a lot of them are too fucking complicated for me because I don't watch a lot of them on TV but I like the kind of overly simplified ones like NBA Jam I always love that game in the fucking arcades and
6304278	6315083	And this new one is somewhat interesting I fucking love Tecmo Bowl on the NES I thought it was great So the idea that they're kind of doing this throwback I find very fucking exciting Will it feature real sugar this time?
6315343	6332170	I don't know The idea of this was kind of leaked a little while ago Thanks to an ESRB rating But now it's been acknowledged Tecmo Bowl throwback is coming out on the Xbox Live Arcade And PlayStation Network sometime in the spring It's a remake of Tecmo Super Bowl You can switch to classic 2D Amongst I guess the 3D
6333591	6336414	The people who fucking made it are South End Interactive.
6336454	6339277	They also made that fucking Lode Runner game and R-Type.
6340238	6341659	Did Lode Runner ever fucking come out?
6342440	6343361	On the Xbox 360?
6343481	6344162	Yeah, some time ago.
6344462	6346244	The R-Type one's pretty fucking rad.
6346284	6349748	If that's the R-Type that's on Xbox Live RTA, that's pretty fucking rad.
6350088	6351870	So this is a good studio to be doing this.
6352291	6353352	All new 3D graphics.
6353992	6356853	And, and, and, online play.
6357753	6358373	Fuck yeah.
6358413	6364295	TechMobile Throwback will have 32 teams, online leaderboards, and customizable options for the teams and the rosters.
6364735	6367696	I don't know, like, are they going to be actual teams or no?
6367716	6368797	They're going to be fake teams.
6369057	6369737	They're fake teams.
6370317	6374898	They're called New York and Denver, but it's not like fucking the New York and the Denver.
6375258	6376279	Still, I'm all over it.
6376799	6380200	I bet you never thought you would hear me say this about a sports game here on OLR.
6380680	6382241	I am all fucking about this game.
6382502	6385264	I am very excited to fucking play this game.
6385764	6388887	DarkSakura's got a few stories for us and then some Twitter topics.
6389047	6390168	I sure fucking do.
6391749	6394631	Rock Band, we are getting some songs.
6394711	6399335	White Stripes Pack, which will be $4.40, $5.50.
6399435	6405399	Fell in Love with the Girls, Seven Nation Army, and You Don't Know What Love Is, You Just Do As You're Told.
6405900	6409363	Individual Tracks, The Future Heads, Decent Days and Nights, Hounds of Love.
6410364	6412988	Um, wasn't that a Kate Bush song?
6413529	6419698	Um, anyway, The James Gang, Walk Away, Neil Peart, The Hockey Theme, and Seamus, All of This, and Tie You Down.
6421281	6423284	And other news, there is a, uh,
6425260	6426441	Okay.
6427542	6430985	Something that was given to me as an incomplete link that I have no idea what it is.
6431906	6434469	DJ Max Technica 2 has a teaser out.
6436010	6437812	So I guess people can go watch it.
6438492	6443537	And then the 8-bit Left 4 Dead dude is doing Mega Man 9 HD remix.
6444678	6446620	So keep your eyes open for that.
6447441	6452223	Although I bet nobody's going to ever fucking play it because there'll be a lawsuit that'll stop it if they ever try to put that out.
6452563	6454184	Because that's just the fucking way the world works.
6454464	6454784	I'll try.
6454804	6455965	Of course, it's not Activision.
6456025	6456845	It's Capcom.
6456945	6457265	Who knows?
6457305	6458306	Maybe they'll be a little cooler.
6459008	6459288	I don't know.
6487958	6488258	I don't know.
6488278	6488759	What do you think?
6488839	6491982	Loki, is Mega Man 10 too much or what?
6492722	6493623	I don't think it's too much.
6494103	6499788	I think it would be pretty cool to see them release more of these retro games.
6501029	6502811	The problem is they're just not as good as Mega Man 2.
6505154	6505954	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6524821	6527725	and hell, I'd like to see a studio that only did that.
6527765	6528646	That'd be pretty awesome.
6528786	6535554	I think DarkTouch Studio raises a fucking good point in chat saying, well, I don't think Capcom would want people playing the equivalent of one of their recent releases for free.
6536275	6537476	Yeah, I can see that.
6537496	6539458	They're still probably making some fucking money off Mega Man 9.
6540480	6543944	So yeah, they would shut this shit down if it was getting out there too much.
6544335	6573250	but I don't think it's a bad thing you know why not you know now that they kind of did the fucking retro 3 and just go in and make some HD sprites keep the same game keep the same just make it pretty or even you know what you could do and here's what they really need to do they need to put fucking Mega Man 9 and Mega Man 10 like on the DS or something like that so I can take it with me and play that shit well I mean those ROMs gotta be pretty small anyways that aside or a new Mega Man collection would be kind of cool with those in there
6575669	6578772	If they want to make a 3D game, make another Mega Man Legends.
6579333	6580534	That would be fucking awesome.
6582192	6584614	Alright, let's get to some Twitter topics.
6585995	6587736	See what you fucking people on Twitter have to say.
6589318	6590598	Every week we read your tweets.
6590959	6593200	Show us your tweets at OLR.
6593320	6603028	Lots of fucking celebration that finally, a year and a half after I think the idea was first announced, we are finally having our fucking fuck show up against the Oscars tonight in a moment of protest.
6603108	6605750	Not everybody fucking on board with the fuck show though.
6605810	6606971	Sterlok sends us a tweet.
6607411	6610173	To be perfectly honest, this joke is already painfully old.
6611462	6612483	It's not gonna be for everybody.
6613804	6617186	Keep in mind, we're not just doing it to say fuck a lot.
6617946	6619868	Which, although I will say that's a nice benefit.
6620048	6625771	But it is a protest against people taking their time out of their busy schedules.
6625811	6629294	They should be balancing budgets to tell us that we shouldn't swear.
6629354	6631575	That swearing makes us somehow unintelligent.
6632196	6634157	It's the same fucking show tonight, just more fuck.
6635118	6637679	But, I don't know, I was a little worried coming into it.
6637719	6639981	It might get fucking old after three hours, but we'll see.
6640581	6642443	Two hours and I still feel pretty fucking good.
6642503	6643884	You guys, you doing okay?
6644744	6644924	Hi.
6645205	6645885	Fuck yeah.
6645925	6646165	All right.
6647206	6647827	Let's see.
6648027	6653551	Spazinator says some very nasty words to Sony.
6654451	6656293	I bet he'll call in later and say some more about that.
6656633	6670836	But also says, let's see if I got this right This is in response to the heavy rain thing SpazinatorPSN says, let's see if I got this right Heads blown off, fine Hot crowbar up the ass, fine Mass murder, fine Tits are vag What sicko wants to see that fucking shit?
6672800	6679668	Dude, it's like the biggest, like, I don't even know what word you would say to describe this.
6680329	6691120	It's just this big, glaring hypocrisy in the media and in society that has been going on for a very long time.
6691200	6692141	It's not just fucking...
6693562	6695623	Video games, but it's movies, too.
6696243	6696903	What's that movie?
6696923	6702484	There was some movie about, like, it's called This Movie is Rated R or something like that that explores, like, the NC-17 rating.
6703044	6705624	Fucking fascinating.
6705664	6710205	DarkTouch Studio wants everyone to fucking know that I Love This Song resumes this week on the site.
6710245	6710685	That's good.
6710725	6713086	I like seeing some more fucking content on OLR.
6713126	6719367	Hopefully there's more than just the I Love That Song segment, which was, you know, everything that was on the website, but I do...
6719867	6720527	I like music.
6720667	6721708	Gaming music is good.
6722268	6725389	I always like the I Love That Song segment and the diversity of stuff that they picked.
6725929	6726470	So fuck yeah.
6727350	6732552	And lastly, Takeo Ray sends his tweet, wants to know, so does anyone have an F-bomb count for the show?
6733352	6737114	I think they lost track in the first fucking five minutes.
6737794	6738955	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6754789	6759491	And, I mean, I doubt that Guinness will pay attention to something like this because it's just a fucking podcast.
6760031	6763432	But, hey, they'll pay attention to, like, what the longest pretzel is or some shit like that.
6764133	6764933	I don't fucking get them.
6765553	6768334	Some of the shit that they fucking record is ridiculous.
6768394	6771555	Hey, maybe we can be in the gaming podcast.
6771635	6774676	Or, not the gaming podcast, the gaming Guinness Book of World Records thing.
6775317	6779038	I was gonna say, maybe we could record her taking a shit.
6780808	6782810	Well, I haven't started talking about the tester yet.
6782890	6784491	I did watch episode two of the tester.
6785252	6786232	Was it worth a shirmy poop?
6787994	6790956	I still feel the same about it.
6791076	6798722	It's not the most terrible thing to ever reach my television, but it's no RuPaul's Drag Race, which would be the best thing to ever grace my television.
6799503	6801745	It's a big what the fuck ever.
6802866	6805568	It gets a three out of five RuPaul's Drag Races.
6807166	6825295	um it should have to lip sync for its life I do think that is something I don't know it's pretty obvious that they fucking film this whole show in the scope of like three or four days like like they're doing a little challenge in the morning kick somebody off to a challenge in the evening kick somebody off to it was really fucking fast I'm sure whatever
6827406	6831068	Just as quick as their career.
6831268	6831328	Hey, $5,000.
6831548	6836530	Dude, if it's just like four days or whatever to film the show, I'd fucking go on the tester, win the $5,000, and then quit.
6836550	6836790	Fuck you.
6841932	6843453	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6869457	6870598	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6888288	6888968	God damn it!
6890449	6896431	BoFuckYouIchikawa in our chatroom, chat.orangelaunchradio.com, said episode four of The Tester is supposed to be LARPing.
6896951	6897492	Oh, God.
6897832	6898592	That's going to be awesome.
6898872	6899452	Oh, well.
6899472	6901033	I'm only through the second episode.
6901113	6902174	I just watched the first two.
6902214	6904114	I'm glad they didn't waste time on those stereotypes.
6904134	6907596	Did you see the people who were doing the live-action Avatar roleplay?
6908476	6908816	Oh god.
6908836	6909016	Oh god.
6934241	6936162	Alright, let's move on with some more fucking gaming news.
6936562	6940823	Then the mailbag, then your fucking calls, which I'm sure are going to be a hoot and a holler tonight.
6940883	6941903	Can't fucking wait for that.
6942104	6943604	Remember, every call counts.
6943944	6944244	Alright.
6945104	6947625	We might have to institute the time limit on calls tonight.
6947805	6948686	I think we're going to do that.
6948726	6950486	I think we're going to do rapid fire calls tonight.
6951006	6952627	Just so everybody can have their say.
6952667	6955088	Because I know everybody wants to get rapid fire calls tonight.
6955168	6955888	Everyone gives a fuck.
6956529	6957752	Rapid Fire calls tonight.
6957792	6958774	I'm already throwing that down.
6958794	6959275	Your call is too long.
6959295	6960318	We hang up on you now.
6960338	6960739	You know what, though?
6960799	6964608	Instead of getting three calls, we could get through like seven if we do a time limit.
6964649	6965811	So we're going to do that tonight.
6966178	6970120	All right, Loki, some fucking gaming news for us.
6970521	6973602	This also has nothing to fucking do with the PlayStation Network.
6974143	6978585	Well, the PlayStation Network technically didn't go down, but PlayStation 3 did.
6979646	6994894	Way back in late 2008, apparently a Pennsylvania teenager playing SOCOM US Navy SEALs got kicked out of a tournament for using a cheat mod, so he decided to take revenge by crashing the PlayStation website for 11 days.
6996675	6999716	and what's funny though is Sony has decided, you know what?
7000957	7009380	They filed a federal grand jury investigation which led to the perpetrator getting arrested.
7009920	7016863	The hacker pled guilty to four felony charges in juvie court and apparently he got access to
7017583	7023025	He apparently got access to the site's servers and let loose a virus that brought everything down.
7023565	7034288	And his methods, I guess, weren't described, but some experts or whatever contacted by local TV stations said they weren't so sophisticated that someone else couldn't pull it off.
7034929	7038530	Hopefully, by now, they've already fixed that stuff.
7040150	7059236	Apparently also it says, in exchange, the team pleaded guilty to four counts and lawful use of a computer, criminal use of a computer, computer trespassing and distribution of a computer virus in exchange for prosecutors dropping the 11 others, some related to the March 2009 cyber attack.
7061137	7061577	That's funny.
7063217	7064017	You know what's even funnier?
7064337	7065698	Is he's from La Trobe.
7067088	7071192	We have a road over here named Latrobe, but this is all in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
7071332	7072773	I actually know where that is in Pennsylvania.
7072854	7074475	Not just Pittsburgh, but what they're talking about.
7074795	7076577	Well, you know, boo fucking who for this kid.
7076817	7078379	He got what he deserved, honestly.
7078399	7080321	You don't fucking hack the website.
7080421	7082182	You got kicked out for fucking cheating.
7082202	7083484	You fucking deserved it.
7083904	7085205	He thought he was leap hack source.
7085225	7086346	Boo hoo.
7086627	7088328	I got banned for cheating.
7088869	7089449	Wah.
7090790	7092132	Have fun in the fucking slammer.
7095032	7101140	On to happier news, a really fucking cute fucking game on the PlayStation 3, LittleBigPlanet.
7101500	7102842	Who doesn't love LittleBigPlanet?
7102882	7103964	It's so fucking adorable.
7104885	7111313	Lots of people do, apparently enough to make 2 million, 2 million user-created levels.
7111333	7112935	There is some pretty fun stuff on there.
7113295	7114016	and DarkSakura.
7130274	7146261	and uh this shouldn't really come as a big fucking surprise but Media Molecule has now been absorbed fully as a first party company for Sony so Sony has now sucked them up into their collective and Media Molecule now has their fucking checks signed by Sony so there it is
7146941	7147702	It's Dan!
7147842	7150784	Media Molecule is no longer an independent studio.
7151804	7161110	And by the way, a comment from Michael Denny, the Senior Vice President of Sony Worldwide Studios, quote, Media Molecule will simply continue to make great games.
7161571	7167174	Welcoming Media Molecule into the PlayStation family will allow us to better support their future titles and ambitions.
7167695	7168895	They're really fucked now.
7169276	7171037	Just kidding, I added that last part myself.
7173081	7173401	All right.
7174463	7177026	Dan yelled from the living room, that's only if Activision buys them.
7177406	7181811	Boy, if Activision comes for your company, run, bitch, run.
7182131	7183232	Just say nay.
7183273	7184854	I can't wait for them to close Blizzard.
7186116	7186977	That'll be the day.
7188138	7189479	DarkSakura, what you got for us?
7190507	7199689	Well, there was a version of a number of different Nintendo games, some of them super rare, that were going on eBay.
7201670	7205230	There was one in particular, Family Fun Fitness Stadium Events.
7205890	7208351	It hit a bid amount of $800,200.
7214201	7216302	Fucking eBay scammers.
7216922	7220263	Like anybody who has that much money to blow on an NES game.
7220463	7227924	Which is actually the highest game on there right now is Bubble Bath Babes with the box for $2,995.
7228044	7231985	Worth every fucking penny.
7232126	7234746	I'll offer a one cent bid on it.
7236527	7240268	I don't think you can put a one cent bid when you have to have a minimum bid of $3,000.
7240688	7241948	Best offer, five bucks.
7242711	7246354	Um, this is totally off topic here, just thought I'd mention this because this is funny.
7246374	7247515	Not fucking allowed.
7247635	7254760	Okay, well this is going back to the fucking story we had about, um, during Rapid Fire, about the Ubisoft DRM.
7255480	7256862	Here's why their server went down.
7257142	7261985	Due to exceptional demand, we are currently experiencing difficulties.
7262326	7265328	Yes, that's right, because their games sold and people bought them,
7265848	7272217	and then try to play them and it logs in online, it causes server strain and therefore it's not going to work.
7272237	7275221	So basically, if you buy their games, it breaks the server.
7276002	7278165	Why don't they just fucking say it's a DDoS attack?
7278185	7280048	Because that's clearly what's going on, right?
7280248	7280649	It's not.
7281009	7282552	It's just from people playing their games.
7284229	7286351	Don't you think that's just a load of bullshit?
7286431	7287653	Just to fucking save face?
7288574	7289394	They're just stupid.
7289895	7292938	Exceptional demand could be a bunch of inquiries to their server.
7293058	7294400	I think they're being DDoS'd.
7295601	7296562	Which isn't okay.
7296842	7298144	I think that's fucked up.
7298204	7298744	I don't support that.
7298764	7300546	I think it's even worse if that's the case.
7301047	7302528	Oh, dude, the exceptional demand.
7302789	7304911	Well, that will be a problem going forward.
7304951	7306973	Okay, I would... You don't...
7307293	7310215	Fucking take all these statements at face value, though.
7310235	7312096	Because look at what Sony said earlier this week.
7312456	7314017	We fixed the fucking date problem.
7314077	7314697	No, you didn't.
7314758	7315698	You waited it out.
7315798	7316939	You fucking waited it out.
7317039	7322242	And then put out a press release about how fucking awesome you are to fix the problem in exactly 24 hours.
7323383	7323983	Come on.
7324303	7325444	We weren't born yesterday.
7326244	7327945	Due to exceptional demand.
7331647	7332228	You know what?
7332308	7332548	You're...
7334989	7340736	Your fucking DRM is about as in demand as a fucking Yanni CD at Lollapalooza, okay?
7341177	7343339	That's how fucking in demand your thing is.
7345562	7345923	Anyhow.
7347085	7348166	More news than the mailbag.
7376349	7381555	Well, they launched with 105 songs, which is fucking awesome.
7382016	7383077	Try that, Guitar Hero.
7384299	7384639	Seriously.
7384899	7385600	Or DJ Hero.
7386842	7388584	Don't even get me started with DJ Hero.
7388684	7390446	Two download packs.
7390506	7391647	Yeah, I should have figured...
7392408	7402015	Um, no, but seriously, compare this to what they have for, you know, Guitar Hero, where they have their basic service that you can, you know, create your own tracks and throw them on there for, uh, free download.
7402075	7404797	But this is, like, way better.
7405137	7406258	And 105 tracks launched.
7406278	7413262	So far, the song ranges from, uh, price ranges are about 80 to 160 Microsoft points, or a buck or two.
7413943	7416164	And, um, you know, just kind of some of the, um...
7417125	7417926	MC Frontalot I love that song
7441625	7447448	Also a little bit of Jonathan Colton in there, including Creepy Doll, Ikea in the Future Soon.
7449549	7450890	Another two bunch of good songs.
7452450	7456372	And then a bunch of other artists I don't recognize, but a lot of other people might.
7457433	7458313	Was it The Shins?
7458974	7460654	Australia, I recognize The Shins.
7462235	7464056	There's some other artists, The Main Drag.
7465737	7467478	Let's see here, Scratching the Itch.
7469625	7469905	Whatever.
7470165	7471166	But tons of stuff.
7471266	7475850	And there's going to be more added each day as this goes on.
7476130	7477851	So definitely worth checking out.
7478171	7487238	They are exclusive on the Xbox 360 for 30 days, after which a selection of standout tracks will become available on the PlayStation 3 and the Wii.
7490191	7502434	OLR should have a fucking song on there like I don't know we don't really have any we don't do music really but I think we should just we should have a fucking song on the Rock Band Network somehow the problem it's it's not an original song
7503171	7503651	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7527169	7550670	Alright, if someone wants to put all that effort and work into it, yeah sure I got one more story for you guys and then we can get to the fucking mailbag This has to do with an update to the Code of Conduct I gotta be honest, although I'm sure this probably pissed me off when I first fucking heard about it I totally fucking forgot about it until this story came out this week That apparently, Xbox Live has now lifted the ban on using the terms Lesbian, Gay, Bi, Transgender, and Straight in your profiles
7551090	7556873	So if you want to put, hi, I like games and I'm a big lesbian in your profile, it is okay to do that now.
7556953	7557774	So have a ball.
7558814	7561656	And I talked a little bit about this on Bobby Blackwolf's show tonight.
7562116	7564037	He's the show before us in all games radio.
7564057	7565758	He's a much cleaner show than we are, by the way.
7566158	7567919	He's always kind enough to do a call with us.
7568679	7572141	Can you imagine how fucking bleeped out he is?
7572401	7574162	I want to see Bobby do a fuck show, man.
7574222	7576003	I want to see him just go off one night.
7576363	7579664	I can't fucking believe this fucking... I love it.
7579684	7579864	Awesome.
7579924	7580084	Anyway...
7599509	7610814	On Bobby's show, I was talking about this a little bit, and I was just saying, like, you know, okay, yeah, I'm a gay guy, and I don't think I really care that I can put this in my profile now, especially on Xbox Live, of all places.
7610934	7615856	I don't want to put, like, I'm a gay gamer, 31, from California.
7615896	7618917	Like, it's not fucking Match.com or whatever.
7619137	7620237	It's Xbox Live.
7620257	7621438	This is anybody's business.
7621918	7624499	I mean, why do people make that such a big deal?
7624579	7628761	I mean, yeah, it's a part of your identity, but it's not like I go around saying...
7629341	7630663	Hi, I like everybody.
7631124	7635710	But I also agree that if someone wants to do it, they should have every right to.
7636270	7636531	Agreed.
7636991	7638453	I just don't understand why you'd do it.
7638573	7642379	But okay, if you want to put it on your profile, you should have every right without repercussion.
7644041	7646404	But you're probably going to get all these messages from losers going...
7647023	7647243	What?
7647283	7648063	You're a fag?
7648124	7651745	Maybe I should put in my profile, send me boob photos, you know.
7654246	7655966	It would be okay to put in your profile, I love lesbians.
7655986	7656727	That's well on my rights.
7656847	7658087	Big supporter of lesbian rights.
7658347	7658727	You could do it.
7658747	7660208	Big supporter of lesbian boobs.
7660388	7661068	There you go.
7661328	7662129	That would be okay.
7663189	7664330	So, there you go.
7664430	7666590	Have fun with your profiles and so forth.
7667351	7669451	Dude, that's someone else I gotta follow on Twitter.
7669852	7670032	What?
7671792	7675954	One of my friends on LiveJournal, they have Tom Selleck in an icon.
7675994	7676194	I'm like,
7676334	7679537	Link the Twitter in chat, we will double the number tonight Link the Twitter in chat, chatters
7699435	7701437	Orange Lounge Radio loves Steve Guttenberg.
7701457	7702418	You fucking know what to do.
7702518	7703779	You need to follow this guy.
7704079	7706261	President Cat approves of Steve Guttenberg.
7706902	7708243	It's three men and a fucking baby.
7708624	7709765	Do we know it's really him?
7710325	7710846	I don't know.
7710906	7712707	It's the only Steve Guttenberg on Twitter.
7714409	7715410	So it must be him.
7715450	7716070	It must be.
7716110	7718132	Who'd want to impersonate Steve Guttenberg?
7719434	7719794	Nobody.
7721257	7722658	Well, let's see who's following him.
7723838	7724259	Loki.
7725179	7725839	I'm on there.
7726580	7728641	Not many actual famous people.
7729001	7729802	Look it up on Twitter.
7729842	7730922	Link it in Chatters.
7730942	7732543	Chatters, you know what to do.
7732603	7733504	It's Steve Guttenberg.
7734164	7734964	Fuck, follow him.
7735204	7737866	I'm going to look and see if there's a Steve underscore Guttenberg.
7738402	7739683	Alright, moving on.
7739803	7740724	Let's get to the mailbag.
7740764	7742166	You gotta stop looking for me.
7742186	7743387	Who do you mean, nope?
7743687	7745809	No, there's not an underscore Steve Goober.
7745829	7747271	Don't you say no to the emailers.
7747711	7749453	I just followed him, so whatever.
7749533	7751575	I feel like such a fucking sheep.
7751675	7752736	I'll go fucking follow him too.
7752776	7753757	Alright, here we go.
7753817	7754378	The emails.
7754478	7756520	Every week you send us your fucking emails and we read them.
7756880	7758802	He has an official website, so we'll figure it out in there.
7761134	7773221	www.orangeloungeradio.com is our website and I think there's an email link there or just open up your email browser and go mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Read us the emails.
7773501	7774622	Oh yeah, I'm sorry.
7776063	7779365	The emails were hidden under Yahoo Japan stuff.
7779705	7779925	Okay.
7780605	7782226	What are you fucking doing on Yahoo Japan?
7782306	7783087	I'll tell you after the show.
7783647	7784748	Why can't you tell me during the show?
7784788	7785468	Is it juicy?
7785688	7786329	Fuck off.
7790106	7790366	Okay.
7791027	7791287	Okay.
7792207	7793488	This comes from JammerJ.
7793668	7793909	Woo!
7794609	7796070	Okay.
7796210	7801854	Who, by the way, sent me a very nice Christmas card with a Sudoku puzzle in it.
7803214	7806356	And... Isn't it fucking March and you're just now getting a Christmas card?
7806396	7809278	No, I got... It bounced back.
7810439	7812360	So, yeah.
7812460	7816123	And he sent, like, I think an Eye of Judgment card or something?
7816223	7816423	Anyway...
7817143	7823110	Um, here was a situation posed to me and I wanted to get OLR's thoughts on this since we are all about the same age.
7823731	7825553	Here is the scenario my coworker gave me.
7826615	7829798	Dave and my other coworkers would put the money into a pot.
7829858	7833222	In order to win the pot, I would have to stop playing all video games for a month.
7833923	7836784	I told him I would not do it and that it seemed a bit ridiculous to me.
7837164	7841385	Dave's reasoning was that my life would get immediately better and that I would be a better person and go out more.
7841785	7849227	The ironic thing was that we were dragged out to a country bar and shooting pool, which I did not enjoy as much, but I could do.
7849407	7852128	I think we were all meh anyways being dragged there.
7852768	7862511	Also, like many others, he sees the gaming lifestyle as negative and he does not know even really what means, like many others not in Idaho.
7865796	7874282	I do a large amount of gaming, everything from Beatles Rock Band on 360 to World of Warcraft, but I balance this out with my weekly workouts, including DDR and my other grown-up things quotes.
7874843	7877124	I am not a poop sucker.
7878245	7885630	I believe that it is what makes us individuals to be different and that we can have different hobbies and interests different than others to enjoy life.
7886030	7889113	Some of the activities that people think are normal drinking, playing pool, partying...
7889913	7893257	I have not done, but I feel empty doing them even with others.
7893317	7896660	I would rather not conform and do what I enjoy by myself than to feel empty.
7897201	7897962	So what do you guys think?
7898082	7900745	Is there anything else I should say to him to back up my point?
7901165	7907452	By the way, in Idaho, what most consider normal is all outdoorsy stuff, floating, river hiking, camping, BSU football hunting.
7907872	7908753	I'm not from Idaho.
7908853	7909814	I'm a Floridian.
7910535	7914097	This email has been brought to you by Red Robin, the home of the delicious Chop House Burger.
7914437	7914917	Oh, damn.
7914957	7917959	Now I'm fucking hungry for one of those Western chicken burger things.
7917979	7918800	We went to Fed Records today.
7919460	7920400	I ate an ostrich burger.
7921821	7922181	Yummy.
7922421	7923322	Fucking delicious.
7923742	7924963	Anyway.
7926003	7927864	Well, first of all, I know a lot of Floridians.
7927904	7931506	I lived about an hour from Pensacola, and a lot of them were rednecks.
7932427	7933688	So, yeah, all the same stuff.
7934148	7934488	You know what?
7934868	7939891	Just tell them, like, you know, flat out say, I'm an individual.
7941681	7945464	This is... I'm not going to change myself to please you.
7946985	7951209	If he's your fucking friend, he should understand that there's some fucking things.
7951309	7951669	Whatever.
7951789	7955632	I mean, if they're hanging out and going to country bars, he's a friend of some sort.
7956053	7958234	If he's your fucking friend, he should understand there are things you like to do.
7958254	7960196	You're not hurting anyone playing a video game.
7960576	7963719	You're not doing nothing but playing video games.
7963739	7965040	You're holding down a steady job.
7965540	7968663	It's not anyone's place to tell another person how to live their life.
7969784	7970284	End of story.
7971837	7972577	DarkSakura.com
7996227	8014526	but I think in return you should ask he should sit down and play a video game with you and try to find a game that you think he might like I mean you know your friend better than I do you might find that new Super Mario Brothers Wii is a game or maybe Call of Duty Modern Warfare is a game up to you my friend but if this guy's really your friend like
8015767	8017348	And he should just take you as you are.
8017488	8024232	Even if he's just a co-worker, then if he's a co-worker, then you get this whole other thing involved where if he's... It's to the point where he's annoying you.
8024892	8026613	You have every right to tell him to stop talking to you.
8026893	8029395	Honestly, like... Then again, that only really works in California.
8030035	8033337	Yeah, I mean... And I would hate that you would have to go that far with it, honestly.
8033437	8033617	Just...
8035982	8040065	Encourage him to be more open-minded and just let him know, hey, there's nothing wrong with video games.
8040225	8045628	Dude, Modern Warfare made more money than most Hollywood movies do.
8045868	8047529	I mean, it is an art form.
8048090	8048410	I don't know.
8048470	8049191	I don't know this guy.
8049211	8052593	Maybe Final Fantasy XIII and the stories would touch him in a way.
8052633	8054714	Maybe some of his people that plays the deer hunter.
8054814	8055234	I don't know.
8056035	8057176	Which that game is actually kind of funny.
8058056	8058276	Anyway.
8058336	8059077	Next fucking email.
8059657	8061860	Dear OLR, I finished Heavy Rain last Sunday.
8061940	8066907	I wasn't affected by the PS3 clock glitch and was able to beat... Sorry.
8067708	8071753	Beat off to and beat Heavy Rain with no problem at all.
8073074	8074837	Oh, oh, oh, special person.
8075297	8079738	To me, Heavy Rain is comparable to a show like Rescue Me, Mad Men, and Burn Notice.
8079778	8080619	Burn Notice is pretty cool.
8081379	8082159	Dan likes Rescue Me.
8083399	8091902	These are shows that would have been absolutely dull to me when I was a young teenager, but really deep and compelling now that I have matured into more adult tastes.
8092382	8093302	Do you feel the same way?
8094862	8099444	They're not shows that I enjoy, but I see why people like them.
8099504	8100944	Like I said, Dan loves Rescue Me.
8101004	8101944	I like Dennis Leary.
8102365	8103805	I think he's pretty hilarious.
8104505	8106065	I watched the end of Nip Tuck this week.
8107506	8108566	It went out with a fizzle.
8109967	8111987	It was just like, eh, we give up.
8114688	8121350	I was really upset because there was no new RuPaul's Drag Race this week, but there was a new Project Runway, and I completely agreed with who they sent home.
8122750	8123850	Is that what we're talking about?
8125891	8129332	I think it's talking about serious dramas dealing with issues that people don't like to talk about.
8130120	8139866	I think there are certainly some shows I didn't really watch as a kid that I could fucking appreciate a little more now that maybe I couldn't appreciate because I was too young to understand.
8140546	8141947	I'm sure there were shows like that.
8141987	8143388	I can't think of anything off the top of my head.
8143508	8146669	There's a few shows though that grow up with you, if you know what I mean.
8147430	8149151	Like watching freaking Rocky and Bullwinkle.
8149511	8150251	or Beverly Hills 90210.
8151152	8153353	I mean, I can't watch that new one.
8153413	8155254	It's such bullshit compared to the old one.
8155614	8158135	I fucking grew up with Brandon and Brenda.
8158315	8160917	I mean, they're my homeboys.
8162037	8163158	I thought she was on the show now.
8164478	8166719	I think she did like a guest thing, but it's not the same.
8167080	8168500	Now she's going to be on Dancing with the Stars.
8168540	8169661	Jenny Garth is on it.
8170101	8171482	Yeah, some of them are on the show.
8171902	8173383	There was one I watched...
8174443	8177366	God, I watch some weird TV when I'm at home sometimes.
8178207	8180589	I watch this show, Overhaulin'.
8180989	8185153	It's basically one of those, you know, they take a car and soup it up type shows.
8186735	8194402	And they did one for, what's his name, Ian... I don't remember the guy's name...
8196348	8197749	Also, I need help with DJ Hero.
8197809	8203572	I seem to be unable to perform the blue button scratch consistently and effectively.
8203592	8207415	It doesn't matter which hand I use or whether the buttons are on the left or right of the turntable controller.
8207475	8208135	I fail on a consistent basis.
8208155	8210616	Are there any tips you can give me, Loki?
8225665	8228306	I'm surprised it's the blue one that you're having trouble with.
8228466	8230187	Is that on the inside?
8230867	8233948	What kind of surprises me is that he has the same problem even if he flips.
8234108	8236709	The first thing I would have said is play left-handed mode.
8236789	8240310	It's probably the inside one, I'm guessing, because it's hard to get a grip on it.
8240370	8247632	What you need to do is when you have your hand on the actual turntable is I normally put my thumb, I rest my thumb on the outside on the actual edge.
8248232	8256335	of the turntable and use that to kind of move the turntable because if you just rely on the friction of your finger on that button, it's not going to work.
8256355	8264419	Yeah, you have to keep your thumb held down to create that kind of friction there or it's too loose and you'll get all these scratches you don't really want.
8264819	8267000	You have to use your thumb to get the traction.
8267020	8268681	I think that's where your problem comes in.
8269081	8269701	But maybe.
8269721	8271962	I'm afraid we're going to get a follow-up email like, I'm already doing that.
8272769	8274030	Well, then you just need to practice more.
8274070	8276550	You might just have to take down, honestly, take down the difficulty.
8276670	8284213	You might be playing on two, I think maybe you're, I don't know, I'm guessing maybe you're a long-time fan of Bomani, so you're trying to take it a little more aggressive.
8284273	8286434	I've been meaning to do this, but I haven't done it yet.
8286514	8288855	I've been meaning to take, like... Aggressively.
8289915	8290695	It's an adverb.
8290916	8291636	Whatever.
8291656	8292856	Fuck adverbs.
8293216	8293596	Oh, yeah?
8293616	8294897	Well, fuck you back.
8295237	8301320	We need to take a metal plate or something like that and find the actual dead zones on each side.
8301761	8312926	There's little dead zones where you can actually move the marker and it'll finally move all the way over to the left and right and just put a plate there so that basically it's just all center unless you go far right, far left.
8313527	8318029	I hate it where you just don't go far enough or something like that and it doesn't register.
8318049	8319350	That'd be kind of cool.
8319830	8321752	I haven't fucking played DJ Hero in a while.
8321792	8322433	I really need to.
8322513	8323113	I'm kind of disappointed.
8323133	8324355	They dropped the price of them at Fry's.
8324395	8325436	They have a ton of them there.
8325496	8328519	I'm really fucking disappointed they didn't support it better with more DLC.
8328559	8330440	They have two download packs.
8330460	8331762	They are not trying at all.
8331782	8333704	They're like, eh, we released a couple.
8333744	8334965	Now we're going to release a new game.
8335145	8336887	They better blow my hair back at E3 with DJ Hero 2.
8340051	8341992	Well, if I can finish the email.
8342253	8343393	Of course you fucking can.
8343593	8347216	Thank you for taking my question and posting the podcast episodes in an expedient manner.
8347736	8348877	Stay care, Redertainment.
8348937	8350938	This message has been brought to you by the following words.
8351059	8353880	Fuck, shit, ass, piss, bitch, dumbass, cocksucker, motherfucker, damn.
8354681	8355982	You are quite fucking welcome.
8356402	8357423	Also, you know what?
8357723	8359444	Is that on our fucking wiki?
8360005	8363307	For in-show jokes, this message has been brought to you by...
8364504	8364864	I don't know.
8365145	8366726	Someone add it right the fuck now.
8366766	8367726	I have to be fucking honest.
8367746	8372670	I haven't read the fucking wiki in a while, but I imagine it's getting updated tonight with the whole fuck show business.
8374671	8375592	Hey, OLR.
8376333	8382257	I was listening to last week's show and I heard Jamie state that she really did not want to discuss the crazy things going on with GameCrazy.
8382717	8385519	I couldn't figure out why until I found out her husband works for the company.
8385979	8391003	I'm a store manager for GameCrazy in Colorado and I think it would be interesting to hear the opinions and thoughts on what's going on
8391363	8394205	especially coming from someone who works in a different district and region.
8394625	8398788	Personally, I am very concerned of what's going on, and it would be interesting to chat about it on your show.
8399228	8403231	Please do not use my name for obvious reasons, but please do respond.
8403732	8406453	I love your show and look forward to downloading it every week.
8406513	8406974	Keep it up.
8407094	8408315	Thanks, someone!
8409916	8410236	Hold on.
8410556	8411157	Dan!
8412758	8414239	We need you for an editorial!
8414259	8415159	Uh-oh.
8416500	8418642	Jamie is summoning Dan to the OLR studio.
8423490	8425231	Tell them to make them wait.
8426951	8428332	Live radio, boys and girls.
8428512	8429552	It's always a fucking mess.
8430132	8438335	We do tape live Sunday nights at All Games Radio www.allgames.com where you can hear fucking train wrecks exploding live.
8438755	8440795	They also did get to hear my Dan voice.
8442816	8446077	But I can understand though if you don't want to fucking talk about it because it's a fucking day job.
8446197	8448278	You don't want to put that shit at risk.
8448338	8452559	So I would completely fucking understand if the answer is no fucking comment.
8452881	8454002	Well, we can ask him.
8454282	8455623	So, Dan.
8456544	8457585	A wild Dan has appeared.
8457805	8463630	We got an email from a listener in Colorado who is a game crazy manager and wants to know.
8463650	8464130	Sucks to be her.
8464571	8464771	Him.
8465291	8465571	Him.
8466172	8469675	And he wants to know what your thoughts are on it being from a different region.
8470696	8472877	If you don't want to say anything on the show, you don't have to.
8473097	8473678	About what?
8474339	8477241	About the closures and how you feel and about what might be happening.
8479463	8480704	Being out of money sucks.
8482553	8491255	and the store's closing sucks and if more of you fuckers would shop there instead of going to GameStop, maybe we could stay.
8491295	8492715	No, no, it's not your guys' fault.
8493035	8494056	It's your guys' fault.
8496556	8497577	There's really not a lot to say.
8498497	8499457	The economy's tough.
8499897	8501918	A lot of good people have lost jobs.
8502538	8504778	A lot of good people are hanging on.
8505858	8508279	And Hollywood and movie gallery are really mismanaged.
8508891	8509471	True that.
8511052	8511813	On a corporate level.
8512173	8512533	Right, right.
8512553	8518377	Well, it's... Don't you work... I've dealt with movie gallery and they're like... No, no, exactly.
8518477	8525222	It's a company that like didn't catch on to trends that were stupidly obvious 10 years ago.
8526252	8526672	Thanks for watching!
8547740	8561592	and that honestly enough that maybe if the bankruptcy works out, which it won't, and any of the game crazes end up staying open, which they probably won't, it would be really nice that the gamers will still have an alternative.
8564280	8566942	To anyone else who works for the company, hey, I'm there with you.
8567642	8568142	It's rough.
8568403	8569483	I can't speak for them.
8569523	8570524	I'm going to show up every day.
8570544	8574707	I'm going to try to help my gamers and I recommend they do the same.
8575287	8580191	If you have a Game Craze in your area and you haven't gone there, hey, visit it while it's there.
8581151	8584934	Give it a chance and hopefully you'll like it.
8586015	8587556	And if you don't, go to hell.
8588316	8590918	Maybe we should do an SOS campaign.
8590958	8591799	Save our stores.
8593154	8599463	Well, I appreciate Dan's perspective because, you know, there are some people that when it comes to the day job, they'd be like, I ain't fucking touching that shit with a fucking 10-foot pole.
8599483	8602607	So I appreciate Dan speaking openly and candidly on the topic.
8602827	8603849	Thank you, sweetie.
8605253	8608636	Support not just independent radio, but support independent game stores.
8608777	8614202	Even though GameCrazy isn't necessarily independent, it's important to point out they're not Walmart and they're not GameStop.
8614262	8616383	So that's independent enough.
8617264	8618926	They're a fucking endangered species.
8618946	8619726	Yes, that's right.
8620367	8621748	They're like a goddamn unicorn.
8621768	8626032	Not the kind that Loki's been playing with all week on that game.
8627153	8627513	So there you go.
8627554	8630036	Are there any more fucking... You know, I actually went and downloaded that song.
8631368	8651416	Always, I wanna be you Hey, we got another one from G-Ditz Hello there, OLR, this is G-Ditz writing in I'm the Swedish dude who called in a few shows ago and talked about the DRM and seeing as how exams are closing in Did I read this one already?
8653216	8654177	Wasn't it really long?
8654437	8657158	Yeah, you did He must have re-sent this
8659505	8675233	Oh yeah, and we also got one from Rababa with the stuff about Portal and the boing boing boing, which we already talked about.
8676862	8678523	Portal at Circuit City R.A.P.
8678583	8680225	when it was released a la carte.
8680865	8681986	I'll have to see what it's all about.
8682066	8683246	Viral marketing at its best.
8683367	8685988	Dude, Orange Box is only like $19.99 now, right?
8686028	8687329	It's really fucking cheap.
8687389	8688030	Seriously.
8688330	8689150	What a fucking steal.
8689190	8691572	If you have an Xbox 360 or PC or whatever.
8691592	8692393	It's a good deal.
8692453	8694774	I really wish I had the game.
8695114	8695615	It's great.
8696135	8697456	I just didn't play it a lot.
8698096	8698517	Moved on.
8698937	8699537	I may go back.
8699797	8701839	Are you fucking done with the fucking emails?
8702339	8702579	Yes.
8702860	8705122	Alright, then you should send us your fucking opinion.
8705162	8706163	It's where every gamer has a voice.
8706243	8708785	I'm replying to the GameCrazyGuy, so email him.
8709706	8713349	I'd be fucking curious, you know, whatever you can read on the show, obviously.
8713769	8716632	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to send us some fucking emails.
8717533	8720275	Meanwhile, it's time to do the FUs of the week.
8720415	8721857	Oh yeah, we're still having them tonight.
8721937	8723778	Just because it's a fuck show doesn't mean we abandon this segment.
8723798	8724379	Yeah, OrangeBoxes1999.
8724419	8724459	1799Us.
8728769	8730715	We got a big story to inspire this tonight.
8740731	8746212	As if the whole fucking reason for tonight's show weren't enough reason to be angry, let me give you a little something extra here.
8746992	8760156	A Korean couple this week has made the news for neglecting their infant to the point where the infant starved because they were addicted to online games at internet cafes.
8760736	8765377	Now, you might want to take this with a grain of salt because it's coming from the sun, but still, sadly...
8767037	8770558	But I trust the sun with all of its sunlight and nutrients.
8770578	8771318	Here's the irony.
8771358	8775099	They were raising a virtual toddler in a game called Prius Online.
8775139	8776319	It's pretty much Second Life.
8776999	8782660	But while they were doing this, they'd leave their real one at home alone each day with just a bottle of milk for nourishment.
8782720	8784920	Dude, it's even worse than Clara from The Guild.
8784960	8787281	At least, like, she's sitting in the same room with them.
8787921	8792742	One day, they came home to find the child dead and called the cops, claiming that they found the kid dead when they woke up.
8796251	8801952	Investigators found, though, that the child was dehydrated and decided that the couple's story was full of bullshit.
8801972	8802392	Good for them.
8802412	8803173	That's just pathetic.
8803933	8805733	This is all disgusting, honestly.
8807493	8809074	Yeah, what else can you say?
8809214	8814475	It's kind of sad you don't have to take an IQ test to reproduce.
8814835	8820076	Like, some days I really wish you had to take an IQ test in order to successfully have an orgasm.
8820536	8821556	Oh, I'm almost there.
8821836	8822557	I'm almost there.
8822917	8823957	Okay, what's two plus two?
8825531	8826072	I forget.
8827895	8828336	No, baby.
8830240	8834168	Anyhow, if that doesn't inspire some angst within you, then I don't know what else will.
8834228	8835571	DarkSakura, what's your FU of the week?
8835987	8838008	Fuck you whoever hacked my Gaia account.
8839528	8847232	Um, yeah, I had about, um, a million in gold stolen and some of my expensive items.
8847432	8852094	And, yeah, I play on it as sort of like a little, oh, I'm wasting time thing.
8852174	8854995	But it's just that, it's just shitty, you know?
8855275	8857316	And I want people to give me my money back, so.
8859197	8860497	It's just completely horrible.
8861958	8862778	That's really it, though.
8862878	8865079	I mean, that and having no time to get my stuff finished.
8866420	8866680	Loki!
8867521	8881577	I'm tired, so this isn't as heartfelt as it was in the beginning of the show, but fuck you to the asshole that stole my 360 and my mod chip and my $60 that was gonna pay for installing the mod chip.
8883138	8886680	and wasting my entire day and making me have to drive down to Stockton.
8887080	8889901	Because Stockton sucks and having to drive back from Stockton.
8891142	8891422	Angry.
8892003	8892303	Angry.
8893023	8893283	Yes.
8894264	8895444	Oh, I was so pissed off.
8896525	8900447	And not only that, waiting four hours in a car in front of an apartment complex.
8900727	8901867	Which I assumed was his.
8902688	8903988	It might not be at this point.
8905449	8907952	I am going to email him this week, though, to give him a chance.
8908233	8909554	Maybe there was some misunderstanding.
8909594	8914199	Maybe his phone fucked up and he just didn't get any of my messages at the very end.
8914620	8915340	Or maybe not.
8915641	8918884	Or maybe not, but hey, I'm going to give him an opportunity to ship me that console.
8918924	8922789	If he doesn't, then I'm going to fucking post his email and his phone number all over the internet, so...
8923476	8924097	Good fucking luck.
8924977	8925998	He has an iPhone, I know that.
8926779	8928501	He pissed off a radio show host, be warned.
8930263	8931464	I don't have a lot of FUs this week.
8931504	8935488	I actually do have a big FU, but it's not one I want to state on the show because it's a sensitive matter.
8936409	8940653	So just FU to feeling underappreciated.
8940673	8941514	I'll just leave it at that.
8944136	8944797	That's it for the FUs.
8946570	8947331	More fuck show.
8947391	8948932	A couple of fucking stories for you guys.
8949332	8950353	Loki, what do you got on deck?
8950973	8957878	So, apparently there's some fucking new design for the DS cartridge that's come out in a patent filing.
8958478	8963081	It looks like a new DS cartridge that's a little bit longer than the normal DS cartridge.
8963882	8965242	It's got... I don't even know.
8965263	8969345	It looks almost like a button or something on the end of the cartridge there.
8969405	8973788	Maybe either for some sort of rewrite thing or possibly...
8975609	8996685	God knows if you ask me, because it's hard to tell based just off this little picture, but people are thinking that maybe it's some sort of expansion device that they're making for the DSi or something like that to allow other peripherals that you might use on, say, for example, the Game Boy Advance slot, like maybe a new Guitar Hero type thing.
8997085	8998286	You know what this makes me think of?
8998726	8998866	What?
8998946	9001088	Is the Rumble Pack that they put out for Pokemon Pinball.
9001748	9029923	um you know it kind of looks like to me almost like some sort of wireless card or something like that but the DS you know already has wireless on it um it's just that button on top it almost looks like a sink or some sort of device maybe a motion controller type thing something like that maybe the button resets you know the orientation or some shit like that who knows we'll find out later on when this actually comes out um whatever the hell it is that they're using this for oh I don't know maybe around E3 yeah
9031403	9031803	It is shit.
9056198	9063042	Alright, I got one more fucking story for you guys and we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.
9063102	9064683	The three minute rule is in effect tonight.
9065063	9069326	Phone calls will be limited to three minutes so that every fucking gamer can have a voice tonight.
9070106	9072688	Valve Games are on their way to the Macintosh.
9073388	9073868	That's right.
9074168	9080331	I guess there were some rumors about fucking Steam going to the Macintosh because of some fucking files that were found in the latest beta build.
9080751	9086833	But Valve has basically hinted very strongly that the games are coming to the Mac.
9087694	9092715	I guess Doug Lombardi, the VP of Marketing over at Valve, actually kind of gave the official confirmation.
9093896	9095857	But no release dates or anything like that.
9097137	9105300	But it's pretty fucking understood that Team Fortress 2, Half-Life, Left 4 Dead, Portal, those are all big, big possibilities.
9105360	9111582	It should be noted Team Fortress 2 is used in some type of little campaign there that is kind of a parody of the Apple ads.
9112062	9118165	So some fucking Mac users are going to be very fucking excited, especially with a game like Portal and all those games, really.
9118225	9119725	Valve makes some pretty fucking awesome games.
9120105	9121106	Those are all going to be worth playing.
9121146	9121666	Yeah, they're pretty cool.
9123035	9123356	What's that?
9123597	9129452	They're pretty cool Yep So even Loki can support that on the Mac More games for the Mac, Loki That's all you ever wanted, right?
9130436	9132357	I didn't want anything for the Mac, and I don't care.
9132377	9136520	That's why I didn't want to release more games to the Mac, because there are people that buy those PCs.
9137020	9138962	I don't understand why, but whatever.
9139522	9141784	You know, make the money where they can.
9143004	9147287	I just want to share, while Loki was reading his last fucking story, I ran out to the fucking car.
9147347	9148388	By the way, the skyline's open.
9148408	9149929	Go ahead and call 1-877-GAME-OLR.
9150509	9154652	I ran out to the fucking car to get more of these PETA chips, which I've become really fucking addicted to.
9155593	9156794	But this is a different brand.
9156814	9159836	These are from Trader Joe's, and these are reduced guilt.
9160476	9161376	Because they're not as fatty.
9161717	9162357	Sea Salt Chips.
9162397	9163858	And I've gotten Jamie addicted to them.
9163898	9164418	Yay!
9164918	9166199	Oh no, I almost bought myself some.
9167479	9170181	Not only is it the Stacy's brand is really good, but these are really good too.
9170241	9172122	These are almost better in some ways than Trader Joe's ones.
9172242	9174062	And they have cinnamon and sugar ones at Trader Joe's too.
9174163	9174523	Yes they do.
9174583	9175123	They have cheddar.
9175143	9176063	They have all the different flavors.
9176564	9177444	Very fucking delicious.
9178264	9180045	I give props to Pita Chips.
9180085	9181006	Hey, our calls are coming in.
9181046	9181886	Let's kick it off.
9183587	9185168	Welcome to the Orange Launch Radio Fuck Show.
9185208	9185568	Who's this?
9187153	9188713	It's, uh, fucking Spazinator.
9188793	9191494	Hey, fucking Spazinator, it's been a long fucking time.
9191554	9193275	What's the latest with you and Sony?
9195235	9213480	Well, you know, at least in my fucking opinion, uh, this whole, uh, clock, you know, fucking deal is, uh, you put another, you know, nail into the fucking coffin, so, uh, you know, it just seems like fucking Sony can't do anything right, so, um,
9214420	9234937	But on a positive note, I did speak to a Sony rep not too long ago, and they gave me another story saying that, yeah, once I send my system in, if they have to send me another system, they'll reauthorize me to download all my videos.
9235017	9237179	So with that being said,
9238855	9241156	I'm sorry, did you start to say something there?
9241396	9243737	No, I was just going to say, at least they're offering that.
9243797	9245417	That seems like fucking more than you got before.
9246918	9248098	Yeah.
9248158	9253820	Well, even with that being said, I would still say that the DRR pretty much fucking sucks.
9254000	9255120	You know what I mean?
9255200	9259642	No one should have to go through this kind of BS every single time.
9260442	9262623	You know, something goes up and then it goes down.
9262743	9263623	You know what I mean?
9264378	9270460	Now, like I mentioned time and time before, you know, I'm so of a big Sony fan.
9270520	9276302	As you mentioned, I tend to pimp out, you know, this, that, or dollar on your show.
9276342	9278823	Fucking PSN is in your fucking Twitter name.
9278903	9281443	Like, you are definitely a Sony fanboy, and that's okay.
9281603	9283824	You know, you've been pretty good.
9283864	9286405	You're not, like, you've been fair.
9286465	9288406	You give Sony a bad time when they deserve it.
9288806	9292687	And it's kind of sad that Sony would be, you know, pissing off a loyal fan like you.
9294201	9299682	I haven't set my system in just yet because I'm a few bucks short to cover the repairs I should have all the money in place
9323991	9327114	Well, good fucking luck to you, Spazinator.
9327194	9332579	Anything else you want to get out with the last few seconds you have tonight?
9332599	9334040	Alright, well, thank you very much.
9348064	9349545	Yeah, great fucking show.
9349625	9351345	Thank you, really fucking appreciate it.
9351365	9353106	Have a great fucking night, my man.
9354606	9356947	Spazinator, poor guy having the Sony troubles.
9357747	9362769	At least they're offering to re-authenticate another system, but it's just such a big pain in the ass.
9362789	9363809	Why can't things just work?
9364329	9365530	Why can't electronics just work?
9365870	9368631	You buy them and you fucking expect them to fucking work.
9369631	9372092	We have any last minute stories to fucking get out there?
9372152	9372932	Oh wait, we got another call.
9373232	9374472	Hold on one minute, DarkSakura.
9374492	9376053	I'll let you jump in right after this call.
9377537	9378878	You're on the Orange Lounge Radio Fuck Show.
9378918	9379279	Who's this?
9380960	9385165	It's Legend of Zaku watching the Oscars and doing this at the same time.
9385645	9387267	Fuck the Oscars.
9387487	9391671	Bunch of fucking sucking each other's dicks with these awards.
9391731	9392572	We all know who's going to win.
9392592	9393513	It doesn't fucking matter.
9393553	9394894	They bumped it up to ten movies.
9394954	9396136	It's a two movie race anyway.
9396476	9397337	Alright, what's on your mind tonight?
9398463	9403948	I guess the word fuck could probably apply to someone who probably some entity deserves it.
9404048	9405349	Case in point, Activision.
9406050	9406450	Ah, yes.
9406470	9409733	It's all spat that happened recently.
9410273	9411655	What's your take on the whole fucking thing?
9412335	9412535	Huh?
9413136	9414517	What's your take on the whole fucking thing?
9415758	9417780	I think I knew it was on its way.
9417800	9419061	I think I knew it was going to happen.
9419281	9420422	It was a matter of when.
9420962	9423765	I mean, the writing was on the wall when Infinity Ward...
9424639	9428800	was actually next to dedicated servers for Modern Warfare 2.
9429340	9434962	You knew that it was something that they probably didn't want to do, but they had someone's hand probably force them.
9436522	9452027	So it's kind of... In other words, the way I see it is that... I don't know, I guess Activision's trying to bring forth the great video game crash that almost happened but never did.
9454076	9455477	Are you talking about the one that happened in the 80s?
9455497	9457557	Because that really did happen.
9459978	9478845	The way you see it is that you have a company that's literally saturating the market, basically trying to bleed all their franchises dry and just minimizing the amount of properties that sustain them.
9478885	9479485	In other words, if
9480140	9486806	If it only comes down to Tony Hawk, Call of Duty, Guitar Hero bringing their only bread and butter, that's kind of dangerous.
9487346	9489988	I don't know if it's going to cause another fucking video game crash, though.
9490028	9492370	I mean, the video game crash happened for so many other reasons.
9492891	9503559	I mean, you get to the point where Guitar Hero is pretty much panned, no matter what new release comes out, because they already know it's going to be the same thing, same drivel.
9504140	9505261	It's not going to be worth the effort.
9505301	9507563	I mean, the last two proved that point.
9508263	9509104	And when Tony Hawk
9509768	9512753	Tony Hawk Ride pretty much bombed for all intents and purposes.
9513373	9519402	It goes to show that they're not innovating but just releasing the same thing and trying to nickel and dime people.
9519972	9521914	No innovation, more renovation?
9522234	9524616	I think they tried to innovate, it's just it sucked.
9525257	9529340	Well, yeah, it's just the fact that they're not trying anything original like EA.
9529600	9532543	EA's learning their lesson already.
9533384	9539969	So you see Mirror's Edge, Dead Space, Mass Effect, because they're actually realizing that you can't put...
9541803	9545946	You can't milk the same cow over and over and expect the same result.
9546187	9551932	It just came down to where they basically had their control system in place and it worked okay for Tony Hawk.
9552332	9555875	And then Skate came out and had a slightly better control system.
9555895	9558697	That's where EA basically knew how to innovate.
9559458	9566043	They found a way to create a skateboarding game that was outside of the status quo.
9566504	9568886	Outside of what Tony Hawk has offered.
9570066	9579118	So you see right there, when you feel to innovate, the only thing you have is whatever you're able to market and whatever you're able to litigate.
9579485	9584887	Alright, I gotta jump in and call time on the call because we're on three minute limit tonight, but thank you, Zaku, as always, for your perspective.
9585707	9586747	Have a fucking great night.
9587407	9587647	Later.
9589268	9590668	We do appreciate Zaku's perspective.
9590728	9592169	And a gold fucking star for Zaku.
9592229	9594189	I did not hear much bam-bam-bamming on the keyboard.
9594749	9600331	I heard little taps, but no worse than when Jamie points the mic at her keyboard.
9600751	9601011	Alright.
9602832	9603332	Love you, mean it.
9603872	9609816	Alright, Jamie, you had a last minute story for us tonight, speaking of which, while we wait for another call at 877-GAME-OLR on our fuck show.
9610136	9612618	I did, and it was... Oh, jeez, sounds awfully loud.
9613238	9619962	I did, and it was when, actually, our good friend Marin left, posted today, and I thought it was really neat.
9620463	9621143	So I'm going to share it.
9622564	9623285	There is...
9627069	9642620	There was a report that is about a guy named Roy Williams who played through Ocarina of Time blindfolded to write a guide on how to play the game only by using sound clues so that...
9646506	9649791	A visually impaired player could beat the game.
9650472	9660385	And so him and three other guys took two years to write this, but Jordan Werner, who was living in Ontario, beat the game.
9663088	9663529	Isn't that nice?
9664500	9666141	Yeah, it's cool.
9666201	9677384	And, you know, I know we have some blind gamers listen to this show that, you know, often kind of talk about, you know, using the kind of the sound cues in the games and being able to kind of play the games that way.
9677464	9687468	And I think that's cool that people kind of go out of their way to write things with sound cues and so forth in these FAQs so that everybody can really enjoy video games in one way or another.
9687608	9688368	So I think it's a great story.
9689108	9689829	The black guy is sassy
9716644	9719405	I'm sorry, it's just that he just comes out kind of sassy.
9733312	9736714	You have to admit, Ranma, Barret was kind of a little bit fucking sassy too.
9737075	9739076	Barret was freaking hardcore.
9739116	9740757	Yeah, Barret was a badass.
9740837	9742838	Saz is sassy in a different way.
9742978	9747601	Like, dude, Ranma, he has a fucking chocobo living in his fucking afro.
9747781	9748382	I mean, come on.
9748682	9756427	But there is, you sense that there is, like, again, I don't want to give story spoilers, but you sense that there is a definitely deeper story to him.
9756507	9760269	He's not just completely transparent comic relief a la Janssen.
9761790	9764053	Jansen was kind of sassy in Lost Odyssey.
9764073	9768798	Well, they never explained right away, at least where I'm at, why he's even with them right now.
9769318	9772541	Yeah, but flashbacks will tell you a little later.
9772722	9774563	So it's all Lost style, remember.
9775745	9777286	But he's a little bit sassy.
9778227	9779388	It's better than Ranma...
9780129	9783572	He's actually, I will say, he is my favorite character in the game right now.
9783912	9790138	Because everybody else is, in my opinion, kind of such a stereotype of the Final Fantasy VII characters in a way.
9790198	9790538	Yeah, yeah.
9790578	9791919	Like, I really, I like him.
9791939	9792820	I think he's really interesting.
9792840	9795562	And the Chocobo in the Afro is so fucking adorable.
9796683	9798905	Is he like RuPaul sassy or just sassy?
9798985	9800766	No, no, he's not like... Is he cheeky?
9800786	9802228	He's not like, bitch, you better work.
9802268	9803228	He's just the comic relief.
9803249	9803809	Is he cheeky?
9804309	9804690	A little bit.
9804710	9805651	He's a little bit cheeky.
9805791	9806191	Cheeky.
9806331	9807092	He's a little bit cheeky.
9810022	9812283	I'm sorry, when you say sassy, I think of your sassy pants.
9813063	9814623	That's a whole different kind of sassy.
9814663	9817303	That makes me think, though, of RuPaul.
9817864	9820104	I don't know why, but RuPaul makes me think sassy.
9821144	9821644	And Tyra.
9822124	9829086	He does say, and I had to laugh because of the lethal weapon reference, I'm getting too old for this.
9829686	9830686	He does, he does.
9831206	9831806	Oh, fuck.
9832186	9836487	I still don't think that no one is going to ever top Cid for the attitude.
9837708	9840310	Sit your ass down in that chair and drink your goddamn tea.
9841231	9846494	But Ranma, be happy because I think they actually have a black guy doing his voice.
9848196	9857843	Well, I will soon find out because I don't know if you guys realize because Otakon is in a few fucking months and guess who's going to have to cosplay this guy?
9858408	9859069	You are.
9859609	9861892	Yes, everyone's like, you have to cosplay this guy.
9861912	9863493	And I'm like, oh, fuck.
9863774	9864975	Ranma, he's pretty awesome.
9865255	9866336	He is.
9867057	9869299	It goes far beyond the color of his skin.
9869339	9870440	He's just a good character.
9870500	9873243	And he has a fucking chocobo in his fucking afro, Ranma.
9874184	9876967	Okay, now one more thing before I get the fuck out of here.
9877127	9878048	Does that make it a chocofro?
9880650	9881130	I like that.
9881430	9882390	Alright, hurry the fuck up, Ranma.
9882410	9882931	Time's almost up.
9883451	9887071	Can I borrow somebody's fucking Xbox 360 for the next few fucking weeks?
9887091	9893052	Because we pre-ordered fucking FFXIII and the roommate's going to be playing it, so you know what that means.
9893152	9898494	I'm going to need to get the Jaws light to get him off it, but if I try to get him off, he's going to kick my fucking ass.
9898534	9904355	Well, Loki might be able to let you fucking borrow one of the broken ones, but in the meantime, I think you better... Well, the broken ones aren't going to really help him.
9904375	9905575	You better let... What the fuck? !
9906215	9910238	You better put a call out to the New York City OL Army, and I know there's a lot of you.
9910278	9913260	Any fucking extra Xboxes out there, help a brother out.
9913840	9914661	That's what's up, yo.
9914801	9915101	Alright.
9915462	9916282	Ranma, gotta let you go.
9916322	9916702	Time's up.
9916923	9917443	Later, dude.
9917923	9918884	Have a fucking great night.
9920445	9924528	Ranma's gonna come hang out with me this summer, and so is... Hold on, we're on another call.
9924828	9925849	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9925889	9926209	Who's this?
9926229	9926910	Welcome to the fuck show.
9927750	9929531	This is Amiga fucking 777.
9930972	9933234	Hello, Amiga fucking 777.
9933274	9934655	What the fuck is on your mind tonight?
9935717	9937778	Motherfuckin' PlayStation 2.
9937818	9939098	It's, uh, or the Dreamcast killer.
9939898	9940478	Yeah, uh, it, it, it killed it.
9940498	9941438	We know it killed it.
9942979	9943159	And, uh...
9960990	9967133	Well, Amiga, what could the Dreamcast, do you think, in retrospect, what could the Dreamcast have done to save itself?
9970234	9973115	Gotten someone who was more skilled in marketing, I guess.
9974095	9975476	Someone that could have said, you know...
9976789	9984216	Hey, when it comes to porting or whatnot, you know, the PlayStation 2 kind of isn't so good on this.
9984296	9990762	So, you know, our port of this particular game is looking better or something like that.
9991582	9995286	You're in no way related to the Legend of Zaku by any chance.
9995920	9996381	Are you high?
9997442	9998103	Knock it off.
9998543	9998863	Be nice.
9998903	10000745	No, I just got a quirky voice.
10001026	10001526	That's all right.
10001566	10002968	No, that's cool.
10003028	10006892	So do I. I was just going to say, though, if you were high, then you've got one of those really cool stoner voices.
10008353	10011277	No, I seriously think there are certain people who just have really cool stoner voices.
10011317	10011817	You know what I mean?
10011837	10012838	No, I do.
10012858	10013018	I do.
10013099	10013399	Mm-hmm.
10013499	10014200	Mm-hmm.
10016757	10022600	There are some nice games, but a lot of the good games didn't really show up until it was almost halfway to when its successor came around.
10040802	10041323	What?
10041343	10041843	No Fantavision?
10041863	10042003	Yeah.
10063962	10064983	I love Fantavision.
10065003	10066744	Fantavision, what the heck, man?
10067724	10068484	It was awesome.
10068745	10073147	Really quickly, we don't have a lot of fucking time left, but since you said you're a fan of Final Fantasy X, what do you think?
10073207	10076368	Final Fantasy XIII, you think you're going to be on board with that, or fuck it?
10077229	10077849	Oh, hell no.
10078089	10083171	I am not interested in any next generation consoles.
10083191	10090455	I have put up my wall here with the GameCube, PS2, Dreamcast, and maybe when I get another job, Xbox.
10092101	10092642	You know what?
10093203	10093763	Props to you.
10093783	10096166	There's still a lot of great games to discover from the last generation.
10096226	10097528	Final Fantasy XII, really good.
10097568	10098789	Dragon Quest VIII, really good.
10099310	10102834	All towards the end of that cycle before the news consoles came out.
10103254	10108640	Anyway, Amiga, gotta let you go, but just before I do, I just want to say, mod files for life.
10109581	10110022	Amen.
10110262	10110903	Amen to that.
10111003	10111924	Alright, take care, buddy.
10112404	10112785	Bye-bye.
10128737	10130358	Welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio Fuck Show.
10130438	10132160	Oh, they hung up.
10132960	10133741	Well, fuck them.
10133761	10134662	Well, fuck them then.
10134702	10138265	No, they probably were trying to redial so fast to get in that they... Yeah, here it comes again.
10138865	10140367	Welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio Fuck Show.
10140407	10140807	Who's this?
10142388	10143629	Yellow there, oh lord.
10143649	10144430	This is that...
10145114	10145914	Other Swede.
10146014	10146594	I get it, man.
10147215	10148475	Hello, Other Swede.
10148755	10149175	I like this.
10149415	10154157	We should have... Like, you know how, like... And I'll credit this on your minutes.
10154557	10157657	You know how we have the tester on PlayStation?
10158098	10162599	I think we need to have, like, a throwdown contest on who gets to be the official OLR Swede.
10163419	10166800	I think we might have to... I have something to say, though.
10168220	10173762	I feel a bit stupid in the sense that, well, I've missed that call.
10178388	10183793	I don't know if you've heard, but we do this thing called a podcast, and you can download old episodes and listen to them whenever you want.
10184134	10184714	Oh, okay.
10196075	10199657	Well, Aki Ripper, I would love to bring the two Swedes together.
10199737	10201258	Maybe G... What's his name?
10201278	10203279	GK... G-Ditz.
10203399	10203799	G-Ditz.
10203879	10208862	Maybe G-Ditz will email us and let us know the next episode he'll be listening, and we can have our Swede-off.
10209042	10209162	Oh!
10209382	10210743	I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
10211684	10214165	An old-fashioned game of OLR match game.
10214305	10215205	We can have the Swede-off.
10219861	10220341	Yeah, it's true.
10220401	10221282	Misty has a good point.
10221302	10222062	Fucking brilliant.
10222262	10224364	Ake Ripper is the original Swede.
10224584	10227626	You do get dibs on being first, so nobody can take that away from you.
10230388	10241396	I was calling in about apparently something I think you've already discussed on the first hour, but still.
10242837	10244618	The new Ascent expansion!
10245782	10247023	I don't think I fucking touched on this.
10247243	10248364	DarkSakura, did you hit on this?
10248384	10248964	I don't think so.
10249745	10250525	Do what?
10250865	10252046	The newest Sims expansion.
10253047	10255909	I'm looking forward to it as soon as I can get my old ones to run.
10258691	10260372	Akira Ripper's way too excited about this.
10260412	10261833	Tell us about the new Sims expansion.
10262253	10274781	Yeah, the expansion is called Sims Ambition, and it was all like, uh-huh, in a kind of way, but still, it's like, yay!
10276095	10284978	The only ambition though that they don't have in there is the ambition to be a porn star or stripper, so I'm really not interested in this expansion at all.
10304662	10305543	Oh, well, okay.
10305923	10311466	Well, maybe... My ambition is to host a crappy podcast on the internet for eight years of my life.
10311486	10313747	Or maybe they strive to be my wall slave.
10314127	10317049	You know, the person that I trap inside my wall of death.
10318409	10319430	Or drown in my pool.
10320030	10321571	Do you have like a saw house in there?
10322071	10324072	No, that's what I do in my Sims games.
10324132	10329075	It's basically, you know, you create a wall or room around the people and you starve them to death.
10329714	10336019	I got to ask Aki Ripper, time's almost up, so I got to ask Aki Ripper, anything else you want to say about The Sims or anything else before we let you go, my friend?
10337800	10348487	I tried to play Sims 2 since last week, and I played for like a half hour, and then, no, I'm going back to Sims 3.
10350229	10351029	At least now we know.
10351049	10355753	Alright, really quickly, in one word, in one word, Aki Ripper, why?
10358935	10359015	Uh,
10359841	10363965	It wasn't all like, uh, what the oof?
10366308	10367009	That's more than one word.
10367029	10368570	That's more than one word, but that's okay, we'll let it go.
10368870	10370312	Alright, HockeyRibber, take care.
10371233	10372394	Take care, buddy.
10372414	10372694	Bye.
10373235	10374596	What the oof?
10375337	10376098	Did he say oof?
10376218	10376959	I think was the word.
10378400	10378701	Love it.
10380399	10382480	I love Swedish people, I really do.
10383200	10386042	I swear to God I've got to visit Sweden before I die at some point.
10386602	10388743	At least when they open the ABBA museum, if nothing else.
10390024	10396967	Mamma Mia, by the way, the big play based on ABBA songs, because the Swedish people love it whenever Sweden gets brought up by Bring Up ABBA.
10398468	10403070	Um, uh, the Mamma Mia play is coming to San Jose in 2011.
10403710	10410873	And I have a friend that works for the, um, uh, the production company that puts all this on.
10410913	10416595	And I'm like, hey, I really want to, um, I really want to, uh, go to this play.
10416715	10419876	And my friend's like, why do you fucking love such a shitty show?
10420957	10422937	And I'm like, cause it's ABBA, shut up.
10424018	10424338	Yeah.
10426833	10429775	1-877-GAME-OLR if there's any more phone calls tonight.
10430055	10434019	Meanwhile, Loki, do you have any other last minute stories for us while we wait for the phone to ring?
10434039	10438223	I'm so disappointed that all my Oscar picks would have won and I would have probably won money.
10438543	10446050	God, this will just teach me that I need to submit my Oscar picks when I actually do them.
10446150	10447391	Stop being so fucking lazy.
10447691	10448011	Whatever.
10473723	10474684	Agent X-Link Hey, how the fuck are ya?
10500589	10501169	DarkSakura.com
10520519	10521680	Well, it's kind of hard at first.
10521720	10524743	I was drooling for the first couple of days looking like a fucking idiot.
10524843	10528425	But, you know, hey, you know, you live, you learn, you do it very slowly.
10528486	10532469	So, you know, and it got me a lot of time to catch up on a few games and such.
10532549	10536652	So I had a friend that had to have that done kind of young, like in the early 20s.
10536752	10537593	So it happens.
10537833	10537993	So.
10538594	10538854	All right.
10539094	10539895	Well, what's on your mind tonight?
10539935	10540195	Excellent.
10542170	10553679	Nothing much, you know, it's great to hear that the DRM is finally cracked so this way during hurricane season I can sit down with my laptop and play Assassin's Creed 2 and not worry about being connected onto a fucking internet feed 24-7, so...
10556650	10556950	DarkSakura,
10575609	10577650	I would give PS2 nothing but love for that.
10577710	10587457	So, I mean, a system that doesn't break or go down for two and a half days when there's certain leafy issues with other consoles.
10590418	10591139	Nice.
10591279	10596502	I like, though, that we kind of get the back-to-back calls about PS2 love versus PS2 hate.
10596722	10597623	It's kind of cool.
10597643	10598724	Not hate, just, you know...
10599907	10603989	Well, you know, there's a shitload of games for PS2 right now I'm still going through.
10604049	10608771	I mean, I can't even start to sit here and tell you how many games I've got to go through for the PS2.
10608831	10621637	I'm sitting right across, I haven't even touched, or I went halfway through, and, you know, and I still have a lot of them, and I'm planning on going through them before I even consider to get a PS3 or anything like that, because, you know, that's going to be more...
10622978	10631226	On my list, so I mean, you know, between that and my PSP and my PC games, I'm pretty much set for probably about almost a year, give or take.
10631466	10636230	It does have one of the fucking largest libraries of video games just ever, and it's not stopping.
10636371	10639774	You know, if you listen to Japanese release dates, there is still fucking shit coming out for it now.
10640535	10644038	Yeah, but unfortunately the American version, though, is slowing down, though.
10645039	10646840	Thanks for watching!
10664272	10671913	They actually have a Sakura Wars game that was coming out on PlayStation 2, getting the nice little collector's edition treatment to that.
10672573	10678234	In April, there's going to be the Lord of the Rings Aragons quest, you know, Lord of the Rings for kids.
10680995	10682335	Yeah, that's about it.
10682355	10685136	Pretty much that's it, unless you're talking about maybe a few EA games.
10686016	10689016	Even EA is cutting them out now for sports stuff, at least.
10689436	10692377	Madden probably will have a PS2 version.
10692888	10696969	I gotta jump in here because X-Links three minutes are up, but quickly, do you have any other quick final thoughts for us?
10697149	10698569	Nope, that's pretty much about it.
10698709	10699610	That's all I had to say.
10699750	10700770	Alright, feel better soon, buddy.
10700970	10701390	See you on WoW.
10701410	10702010	Yeah, I feel better.
10702030	10702230	Thanks.
10702250	10702670	Alright, later.
10703771	10705351	Alright, I think that's gonna do it for the Skyplane tonight.
10705371	10708212	We got a lot of listeners in tonight, so thank you guys very much for the phone calls.
10708432	10709252	Really appreciate it.
10709292	10710812	If you didn't get through, sorry, guys.
10711392	10713613	I'm really fucking sorry, but you have to send us a fucking email.
10713653	10718614	Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com I know Loki's been fucking waiting to do some last-minute fucking stories, right?
10718974	10719455	Yeah, sure.
10719555	10720576	Alright.
10720816	10723179	There's some interesting information.
10723999	10734611	Apparently, Batman Arkham Asylum is getting the Game of the Year edition, which was supposed to be coming out over in the U.S., and as far as I'm aware, still is coming out over in the U.S., unless they've already announced that they're not.
10735111	10736172	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10754203	10781766	3D that will allow you to view the game in 3D and doesn't rely on red and blue lenses meaning the colors are preserved and apparently will work with HD and standard definition sets which, you know, if that works now, I think they should that sounds like a good idea, sounds cheap speaking of good ideas coming from Warner Brothers, okay, well I'm being sarcastic here they're in talks now to produce a Space Invaders movie
10782006	10785528	Yes, the movie industry has run out of ideas.
10786268	10788229	Well, at least they could do whatever the fuck they wanted.
10788249	10790790	I mean, it's not like there's this big fucking plot to Space Invaders.
10791471	10792591	Aliens are invading Earth!
10792791	10793252	Shoot them!
10794052	10794332	Wow.
10794952	10804257	Yes, so Space Invaders, apparently they're speculating that the film will be a big budget action blockbuster movie.
10804997	10823753	Helm by some prolific director Sony has filed some patents for game demos apparently that will lose feature over time Which I have to say is the worst idea ever Can't you just fucking re-download it?
10824814	10852368	well maybe you won't be able to maybe it's going to be like those time trials you know on Windows and stuff like that and why should I have to fucking re-download say if I want to show a demo I play a demo say for a game that you may not be getting a lot of press or whatever and I want to show my friends like for example Wet Wet I thought the demo was fucking awesome and I showed my friends and they got excited about it if I have to play the game again and the features are removed that's going to be pretty disappointing well it was cool the first time I played it
10852668	10857855	Well, what you have to do is you have to make another PlayStation profile and have your friend sign in to play.
10860219	10862462	No, not going to do that.
10863853	10870058	Um, apparently Ubisoft is looking to take on Tony Hawk, which shouldn't be too difficult.
10870799	10874342	Uh, at this point, and they're going to put out Sean White skateboarding.
10874362	10878325	Yes, Sean White, um, apparently skateboards as well.
10878826	10885551	And, uh, unfortunately though, in the screenshot that they have of Sean White snowboarding, looks like a Geico caveman.
10885911	10891976	So I don't know what's going on there because he certainly doesn't look like a Geico caveman, um, normally.
10891996	10892037	Um,
10893337	10899962	and yes, so they're going to be releasing that game apparently and most likely on the Wii because that's where the last one came.
10900682	10908307	Test Drive Unlimited is getting a sequel coming out apparently this fall to PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
10908807	10916552	And apparently the sequel will also have new elements including day-night cycles, weather effects, and vehicle damage.
10917693	10921816	And hopefully the cops will figure out how to chase you down when you drive off the road.
10921836	10921916	Yeah.
10922734	10926815	Apparently our chatters are not big fans of my Muppet voice, which I guess is what that is.
10927595	10927935	Let's see.
10929476	10932757	Fucking Shaoran in chat says, so is next show the Muppet show or something?
10933237	10934517	That would be awesome.
10935777	10936097	No.
10936678	10942439	Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, and welcome to the OLR Muppet show.
10942459	10946260	Muppet babies.
10946320	10947840	We had that happen a couple episodes ago.
10947961	10949541	Ake Ripper is the Swedish chef.
10953291	10954492	The Swedish chef is racist.
10956353	10957634	I don't appreciate your racist joke.
10958475	10958735	Alright.
10960916	10961577	Listen, frog!
10965059	10969102	So yeah, that's... The OLR Muppet Show is all about moi.
10973805	10975867	Wow, I fucking made Loki shut the fuck up.
10975987	10980130	No, I'm just rolling my eyes, and unfortunately you can't hear that on the radio.
10980150	10980250	Yeah.
10982871	10986643	I don't know you people.
10987386	10987928	Yes, you do.
10988168	10988831	I'm hiding.
10989571	10990492	You're my BFF.
10990632	10990952	All right.
10991392	10992233	I know, Rob.
10992493	10998217	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts tonight because believe it or not, we're at the end of the fucking show.
10998237	10999758	I hope you enjoyed your fucking selves tonight.
11000639	11003300	It was a pretty fucking good time and I'm sure we said the F word a lot.
11003801	11005762	Maybe we'll get a count after the podcast goes out.
11005802	11006463	I don't fucking know.
11006903	11007323	We'll see.
11007503	11009425	I didn't put a lot of fucking effort into it, unfortunately.
11009445	11009805	That's all right.
11009825	11011526	At the beginning of the show, I had a lot more fucks in the end.
11011546	11011766	It was a...
11013007	11014088	You get tired after a while.
11038984	11040645	It doesn't just have to fucking be on iTunes, though.
11040665	11042507	Just tell a fucking friend, you know, in real life.
11042607	11043607	Project Real Life, right?
11044028	11046709	Tell some fucking friends what you heard on Orange Launch fucking radio.
11047190	11049331	And tell friends to listen to shows.
11049351	11052834	But you might want to not have them fucking start with this episode.
11053314	11055996	Like, this should be, like, maybe the fourth episode you listen to.
11056036	11057637	Don't have this be somebody's fucking first episode.
11057917	11058958	But just tell your fucking friends.
11059018	11059478	Word of mouth.
11059518	11061960	That's all we fucking got because we're an independent fucking podcast.
11062480	11062920	Aw, yeah.
11064541	11064882	That's it.
11064922	11066923	Let's go around and get everybody's fucking final thought tonight.
11066983	11068464	Dark Sakura, what's your fucking final thought?
11070927	11071227	Fuck.
11072329	11073711	Loki, your fucking final thought tonight.
11074612	11078036	We'll have to see where this thing goes with this guy ripping me off.
11079879	11080760	I don't know.
11082662	11085366	It's very annoying.
11086969	11090411	And my fucking final thought tonight is Sassafras.
11091492	11092072	Good night, everybody.
11092092	11092672	Have a great week.
