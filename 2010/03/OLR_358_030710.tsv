0	3000	The following program is intended for mature audiences.
3000	6000	Orange Lounge Radio.
10000	16000	Here's your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Lowkey.
17000	22000	Tonight, March 7th, 2010, we get first impressions on Final Fantasy XIII.
22000	31000	One of our favorite games is patched with teasers of a sequel, and the Rock Band Network goes live.
31000	34000	Orange Lounge Radio.
46000	50000	I come bearing a message from President Catt.
50000	57000	Here in California, home of Silicon Valley, home of video games, we are in a budget crisis.
57000	62000	State employees are furloughed, meaning we can't go to the DMV most Fridays.
62000	67000	Students are protesting out on the freeways amidst high tuition cutbacks.
67000	72000	Yet somehow, our legislatures found the time last week to pass a resolution
72000	76000	supporting Anti-Cussing Week to take place this very week.
76000	82000	Residents are encouraged to refrain from cussing and donate swear jar money to charity
82000	86000	because swearing bothers some 14-year-old in Southern California.
86000	94000	Apparently, swearing profusely shows a lack of intelligence or some sort of lack of character.
94000	101000	However, substituting words like opicles and sassafras, which have all of the same intent,
101000	105000	is somehow okay and makes you a smarter person.
105000	109000	As residents of the state of California, we reject this notion.
109000	113000	As intelligent individuals, we take offense to the notion
113000	117000	that using versatile swear words somehow demonstrates a lack of intelligence.
117000	121000	As free citizens of the United States of America living under the First Amendment,
121000	125000	we say, fuck yeah, to free speech.
125000	128000	We will work tonight in protest of No Cussing Week
128000	133000	to break the record for most uses of the F-word on an internet podcast.
133000	141000	Tonight, on a very special Orange Lounge radio, we bring you The Fuck Show.
159000	162000	Welcome to another fucking week of Orange Lounge fucking radio.
162000	165000	My name is Rob, Fucking Roberts, here with you every week as always.
165000	170000	Say hello to the one and only fucking wonderful Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
170000	172000	Well, fuckity fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.
172000	174000	How the fuck are you tonight, young lady?
174000	175000	Fucking rad. And pissed off.
175000	177000	Why are you so fucking pissed off tonight?
177000	179000	Because people just annoy the fuck out of me.
179000	184000	Why? What did they do? What ruffled your fucking feathers this week?
184000	189000	I'm just fucking annoyed at people feeling like they have to defend their own fucking opinion
189000	192000	every fucking time someone says something that's different from them. So fuck them.
192000	194000	Not really fuck them, but just fuck in general.
194000	196000	I know, just fuck them. Right in their fucking ears.
196000	201000	Hey, say hello to the one and only, he is so fucking smart, tech master, Loki.
201000	204000	I keep fucking coughing. I wish this fucking gold go away.
204000	206000	You have been fucking sick for like 30 fucking weeks now.
206000	211000	I haven't been coughing all day long, but then all of a sudden this fucking coughing started after I ate all of my chicken.
211000	212000	Would you like some tea?
212000	216000	No, I really hate fucking tea. Tea is awful.
216000	223000	No, I think it's the root beer. And while delicious the root beer was, it makes me cough. And that's not good.
223000	225000	Are you allergic to fucking root beer?
225000	227000	No, I am not allergic to root beer. Root beer is awesome.
227000	232000	It's just, you know, the carbonation or whatever kind of loosens the fucking phlegm in my throat.
232000	237000	So, it sucks. But yeah, otherwise I'm fine. I'm fucking great.
237000	239000	Alright, glad to hear it.
239000	243000	Alright, well folks, we do have some gaming news to get into a little later.
243000	247000	But first, we always fucking start off the show talking about our fucking gaming weeks.
247000	249000	Like, anybody really gives a fuck what we've been playing.
249000	251000	But that's just how you do a video game podcast.
251000	254000	We've been doing it a very fucking long time, about eight years.
254000	257000	So, we used to start with a little segment called How Was Your Day? How Was Your Week?
257000	262000	But no one really gave a shit. So, we evolved it to fucking video games.
262000	264000	So, how the fuck was your gaming week, DarkSakura?
264000	265000	It was fucking boring.
265000	270000	I played Star Trek Online and made it to Lieutenant Commander. Finally, fuck yeah.
270000	276000	And got this weird Klingon chick and a Bajoran dude, but fuck him.
276000	282000	And that's about all. I didn't do fuck all.
282000	287000	Alright. It's more fucking Star Trek Online, same fucking story every fucking week.
287000	291000	But that's alright. That's what it's like to be fucking addicted to an MMO. I should know.
291000	293000	I'm not addicted. Fuck you.
293000	296000	Okay, sorry. Maybe not fucking addicted, but fucking...
296000	303000	I set a day. A day that is my fuck off day. Where I do fuck all.
303000	306000	But play my damn game and fuck around on the internet.
306000	310000	I think it's good to have a fuck off day. I have fuck off days on days ending in one.
310000	315000	I have actually started a project. A fantastic fucking project.
315000	317000	That does not involve fucking, by the way.
317000	329000	Called Project Real Life. Where this thing, this evil box, this fucking whore of a computer gets turned off.
329000	331000	How the fuck are you able to function?
331000	337000	But you're fucking playing the game in real life. So I don't understand what the fucking point is.
337000	340000	I'm paying attention to my own fucking real life.
340000	344000	Well fuck me then. No thank you.
344000	347000	Alright. Loki, how the fuck was your gaming week?
347000	351000	Well let's talk about how awesome my gaming week was.
351000	355000	No wait, let's talk about how awful today was. Today was a fucking mess.
355000	361000	You see, I have a fucking 360. Well, many fucking 360s.
361000	366000	One of which was apparently going to be modded or J-tagged, if you will.
366000	373000	And so I found some guy on Craigslist, which right there should have sent out some fucking signs.
373000	378000	That would be willing to do it for me. So we arranged to meet this morning.
378000	384000	So I drove a fucking hour and fifteen minutes down the Stockton, the butthole of the Sacramento County.
384000	387000	Well actually it's San Joaquin County. Still butthole of the county.
387000	392000	And so we went down there, and mind you...
392000	397000	Actually, just to quantify. In the fucking state of California, you have fucking Fresno.
397000	401000	Which I think is generally accepted as kind of like the asshole of the state of California.
401000	405000	No fucking offense to those that live there. Stockton would kind of be...
405000	412000	It's kind of like between the asshole and the balls. So Stockton is kind of the fucking taint of California.
412000	414000	And there's nothing on the way.
414000	415000	And it's not pleasurable.
415000	419000	It's just cow country. Fucking shitty smelling cow country.
419000	424000	Anyways, so I decided... Okay, mind you, I woke up at 730 this morning.
424000	427000	That's fucking early on a Sunday.
427000	431000	I drove all the way down there. Met the guy just before 9.
431000	439000	Gave him my console. Paid him the $60 it would be, you know, to solder in the chip that I wanted him to solder in.
439000	443000	Told me it would take about, you know, fucking 30 to 45 minutes.
443000	448000	Four hours later, waiting in fucking Stockton.
448000	452000	The guy's not returning any of my text messages. He's not returning any of my phone calls.
452000	457000	And so I'm fucking sitting there going, okay, well, I guess I'm either going to fucking sit here all day,
457000	462000	or I'm going to have to fucking leave and leave my console behind and assume that I'm getting ripped off.
462000	465000	So that's what happened. I got fucking ripped off apparently.
465000	466000	Well, fuck him.
466000	473000	Yes, fuck him indeed. And so I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt for now.
473000	478000	And assume that this really was a mistake and his phone is all fucked up or whatever.
478000	486000	And so I will be polite and contact him by email, you know, giving him the opportunity to, you know, fucking ship me my console.
486000	491000	However, if he doesn't do that, then I'm fucking posting his phone number and posting his email.
491000	496000	Hey, don't forget. Send me his IP. I will find his fucking address.
496000	502000	We can go show up at his house and say, fuck you. Give it back.
502000	505000	So, anyways, and then Final Fantasy 13.
505000	508000	This is not the C-word show. Fuck you.
508000	512000	And then Final Fantasy 13. That's, you know, basically been my gaming week.
512000	516000	By the way, Dark Soccer is just fucking openly swearing randomly at our fucking chat room.
516000	521000	Chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to join all the fucking action tonight in our chat room.
521000	527000	Yes, three hours of this tonight, ladies and fucking gentlemen. It could be this or the Oscars, I mean, honestly.
527000	533000	And remember, keep track of how many fucks get fucking said so that we can fucking send it to fucking Guinness and fucking Ireland.
533000	536000	Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
536000	538000	Hey, stop trying to run up the counter artificially.
538000	539000	That's not artificial.
539000	540000	Fucking stop it.
540000	545000	I'm legitimately saying fuck, and I can say fuck as much as I fucking want to, Rob, so fuck you.
545000	546000	Oh, in a good way.
546000	548000	Loki, any more in your fucking gaming room?
548000	549000	Rob, I fucking love you.
549000	551000	I fucking love you too, bitch.
551000	556000	I also played some more of, oh, what the fuck, Borderlands.
556000	562000	I played more of Borderlands because I'm trying to get the game finished before I can, you know, fucking start the new expansion.
562000	569000	And I'm liking it still, and I just have to level up my characters.
569000	574000	Actually, I have to level up my friend's character because he's fucking 18 levels below me.
574000	578000	So, yeah, so I played a little bit more of that.
578000	585000	And of course, Grand Theft Auto, you know, fucking, what, ranked like 74 now in the true skill ranks.
585000	590000	And then I'm still fucking like 195 in the regular ranks just because I don't play on the weekends.
590000	593000	And it's, you know, kind of bounces around during the week, so.
593000	597000	But true skill's really where I'm, you know, trying to get to the top of the fucking list.
597000	600000	And doing pretty good. So, that's it.
600000	606000	You notice how our chat room has been increasing exponentially?
606000	608000	Oh, and fuck deft? Cunt.
610000	613000	I said it. I hate that word, and I said it, so whatever.
613000	616000	I'm looking at the chat, and all these fucking people are in there tonight.
616000	620000	We love you all, by the way. We fucking love you and your support so much.
620000	624000	But we have Hardcore77777. That's a lot of fucking sevens.
624000	628000	And his name there says, oh wow, I picked a bad night to listen.
628000	630000	Yes, you fucking picked a bad night.
630000	632000	Welcome to your first fucking live show. Congratulations.
632000	634000	How was that?
634000	636000	Isn't any week a fucking bad night to listen?
636000	637000	Who was that?
637000	641000	Hardcore77777777. Seven. Seven.
641000	645000	And a fucking GP says, fucking GTA again? Fuck Loki, fuck.
645000	648000	Hey, I believe that every fucking day. Twice fucking day.
648000	651000	Actually, sometimes three fucking times a day.
651000	654000	And I fuck everyone up in it, because I'm so fucking awesome.
654000	658000	So, I have to. I have to mention it every week.
658000	660000	It's what I'm proud of.
660000	663000	In fact, and we'll get into this a little bit fucking later,
663000	669000	but remember how they updated some TOS stuff for Xbox Live?
669000	678000	And now I can post my Ballad of Gay Tony ranks in there without, you know, the word gay being, you know, fucking banning me.
678000	682000	Ah, well congratulations I suppose. There's a good reason.
682000	685000	That whole policy was kind of fucked anyway. It was overcompensating.
685000	687000	Is that a story later we're going to get into?
687000	689000	I should probably shut my fucking mouth then.
689000	694000	Anything else you want to talk about during your fucking gaming week?
694000	699000	Just Final Fantasy's awesome.
699000	703000	Alright, my fucking gaming week. I've been playing a lot of fucking WoW as usual.
703000	708000	My character's probably to about fucking level 53 I think I finally fucking dinged this week.
708000	709000	Fucking addict.
709000	711000	Shut the fuck up.
711000	713000	Bite my fucking ass.
713000	718000	My boyfriend though, he got to level fucking 55, so he can roll a fucking Death Knight now whenever the fuck he wants.
718000	723000	But we might do like the twin Death Knight thing like fucking later, but I don't know.
723000	726000	Like right now the fucking focus is getting his fucking character to 80.
726000	731000	But the problem is I found another game that's going to fucking sink all my time for the next two weeks, which I'll get into in a minute.
731000	734000	But I wanted to talk about a couple of other fucking games real quick.
734000	737000	One of them is Critter Crunch. It's so fucking cute.
737000	740000	And I finally played the full version of the game. I played the fucking demo before.
740000	744000	It's fucking cute. It's a lot like Magical Drop. Did you ever fucking play that?
744000	748000	Yeah, I played that. I didn't really care for it too much, but...
748000	754000	Imagine if Magical Drop wasn't about matching the fucking colors, but it was about putting things in a fucking sequence.
754000	760000	Like instead of like fucking all the blues disappear, it's like you got to go fucking green, red, and blue in an order or whatever.
760000	761000	That sounds too fucking complicated.
761000	767000	No, it's not that fucking bad because it's little bugs, fucking medium-sized bugs, and then big bugs.
767000	771000	And it's pretty intuitive to figure out. It's not that fucking hard.
771000	779000	And there's these weird elements too where you fucking barf rainbows into little critters' mouths and all these like overly cute fucking things.
779000	782000	Well, no wonder you fucking like it. Barfing rainbows.
782000	784000	Shut up. It's fucking cute. Shut up.
784000	792000	And there's lots of modes in it. I wish I'd bought the fucking game when it was on sale, but it's okay because it's on Alan's PlayStation 3 so I can play it whenever the fuck I'm over there.
792000	798000	But it was really cute. I played through a good probably 15 stages while I was there and got some trophies.
798000	804000	It's cute. I think it's a fucking good deal and if I wasn't so busy playing something else right now, I might fucking buy the full version.
804000	806000	Who wants some fucking tequila?
806000	807000	You have fucking tequila?
807000	808000	You bought it.
808000	810000	If I didn't have to fucking drive home, I would.
810000	811000	We can do a shot now.
811000	814000	As if my swearing wasn't bad enough right now.
814000	817000	Well, fuck it. It's a night just to fuck it. Do you want some tequila?
817000	818000	I don't want any tequila.
818000	819000	I better pass. I better pass. Thank you though.
819000	820000	Fine. I'll drink my beer by myself.
820000	822000	You fucking drink yourself into a coma.
822000	824000	Alright, let's see.
824000	827000	I play Misty too.
827000	828000	Why is that?
828000	830000	Just tell me about fucking beer.
830000	833000	Um, let's see. What the fuck else is I playing?
833000	836000	Oh, Final Fantasy II on the fucking iPhone.
836000	841000	You kinda know what you're in for if you're gonna download a Final Fantasy game onto the fucking iPhone.
841000	847000	Because the iPhone, although it is a gaming platform, it's kind of a fucking terrible one because there's no fucking controller.
847000	850000	And that's the worst part about Final Fantasy II.
850000	853000	I will say this. The game fucking looks great.
853000	856000	It's fucking gorgeous. It's one of the best fucking looking games on the iPhone.
856000	857000	It's a port of the fucking PSP one.
857000	860000	It is. It's a fucking port of the PSP one, almost like tit for tat.
860000	864000	But, they have made some fucking adjustments to it to make it more touch friendly.
864000	869000	For instance, when you're in a battle, you have all these little fucking icons instead of the words to attack.
869000	876000	And even when you're in the menus to cast fucking magic, there's these little fucking icons that show up that you use to cast your fucking spells and shit.
876000	882000	And, you know, if you want to cast your spell on all the fucking enemies, you drag your finger to select all the enemies.
882000	887000	You can't unfortunately just fucking sit there and hammer the A button to get through all the fucking battles.
887000	891000	You know, you kind of have to tap tap tap tap, so everything's a little bit fucking slower.
891000	894000	That's not the annoying part. I don't fucking mind that as much as I do.
894000	901000	When you're in the fucking towns, and you're having to use the fucking fake D-pad on the touchscreen and the fucking button to run,
901000	906000	And you're trying to talk to fucking townspeople, because the framerate is so fucking bad.
906000	911000	And everything is so fucking jumpy that you literally have to chase all the fucking townspeople around for a fucking minute just to fucking talk to them.
911000	916840	to them which shouldn't be that fucking hard in a Final Fantasy game well they
916840	921280	don't fucking tell you that before you buy it so you won't know until you buy
921280	924540	it but I will say this nine dollars is a pretty fucking good price for Final
924540	928880	Fantasy 2 again I bought Final Fantasy 2 because I played the original fucking
928880	932840	Final Fantasy a ton of times so whatever but the Final Fantasy fucking 2 I only
932840	936440	played once on the PSP so I decided what the fuck I'll buy this just to kind of
936440	939720	check it out it's only nine dollars I will say this if you have a fucking PSP
939720	945000	just spend the extra ten dollars to get a copy of the Final Fantasy yeah you
945000	949800	could probably fucking find it used somewhere for cheaper so yeah if you're
949800	954920	gonna pay nine dollars for the fucking iPhone version did I say nukin is that a
954920	963680	nukin nukin but it's fuck inga yeah thank you I know um if you're gonna
963680	966980	spend half as much to get the iPhone version then you fucking get what you
966980	969520	fucking pay for that's all I have to say when it comes to controls this kind of
969520	975200	weak sauce but it is a beautiful game and you know with being able to save
975200	980200	anywhere the fuck you want to it's a good game to just pass the time if
980200	983320	you're you know on the fucking potty or sitting at the fucking doctor's office
983320	986600	waiting for something it's it'll take you probably a year to fucking beat that
986600	994880	way but you can fucking do it so there you go um let's see other fucking gaming
994880	998200	news this week okay I'll tell you a game that's been taking a lot of my fucking
998200	1004040	time Final Fantasy 13 I've sunk about five and a half hours into it so let me
1004040	1006680	give you my first impressions and I'm gonna step away from the f-word thing
1006680	1009880	for a minute because I I know a lot of people are really anticipating this game
1009880	1013560	so I want to talk seriously about this for a minute so Final Fantasy 13 is
1013560	1017280	obviously on its way out on Tuesday and we got a copy through legitimate
1017280	1020520	purposes don't you worry it's it's totally legit and all that stuff just a
1020520	1023240	few days early just so we could jump in there and have something to say about it
1023240	1028680	today it played through the game and you know I've read a lot of the reviews are
1028680	1033000	online just like a lot of you guys have about how the game is is really fucking
1033000	1036720	linear and you know it's kind of just an interactive movie where you're just
1036720	1041920	fucking bashing the X button for a long time and I kind of go well Final Fantasy
1041920	1047400	7 I see a lot of comparisons from 13 to 7 at least in the bits that I've played
1047400	1051640	so far you might remember in Final Fantasy 7 you started that game and you
1051640	1055920	were in Midgar and you were trapped there you know I shouldn't say trapped
1055920	1058760	it makes it sound like you couldn't do anything but you were playing a somewhat
1058760	1062920	linear story for about the first seven hours of Final Fantasy 7 until you
1062920	1066080	depending on you know how fast or slower you are you tell you get out of Midgar
1066080	1069960	and explore the overworld now I know an overworld well I don't I don't really
1069960	1073120	know what I haven't read spoilers on 13 and I don't want to know so chat stay
1073120	1075840	quiet I don't know if there's an overworld that shows up but I already
1075840	1079160	know there's no towns so I imagine it's gonna stay kind of very well they have
1079160	1083960	took over writing they have in the manual so obviously okay so so there's
1083960	1087280	gonna be some type of overworld later that's gonna be similar to seven in fact
1087280	1091440	honestly guys this game has a lot in common with seven there's a lot of the
1091440	1096080	same types of characters like lightning and cloud have a lot in common except
1096080	1100920	one's got a vagina there's you know the emo kid that you just want to slap
1100920	1104720	across the face there's your sassy black man that's there for comic relief I mean
1104720	1110320	there's a lot of similarities and but that isn't a bad thing I mean Final Fantasy
1110320	1114600	7 was a really good game it got overblown a little bit by the fucking
1114600	1123560	crazy-ass fans out there but it's it was still a good game 13 is kind of linear
1123560	1127080	in the beginning because you're running down a railroad track so yeah there's
1127080	1129740	not a lot of fucking places to go because you're supposed to be running in
1129740	1133100	a fucking straight line but I kind of consider that part of the very slow
1133100	1136080	learning curve of this game and I think that's what's gonna make or break people
1136080	1140780	consider that you don't learn about paradigm shifts which is this huge
1140780	1144440	fucking change to the battle system until you're three hours into the game
1144440	1152320	is that like x2 or 10 to um I think that's a lot of I mean Lost Odyssey kind
1152320	1157440	of had some of that too a lot of these are so it does remind me a lot of Lost
1157440	1162680	Odyssey actually mm-hmm but Lost Odyssey was more like you know Final Fantasy but
1162680	1165800	when I say it takes three hours to get there I don't want you thinking you're
1165800	1169160	just fucking bored for three hours just sitting there jerking off doing nothing
1169160	1173360	I kind of find this game to be like a like a banana or something that slowly
1173360	1178680	peels and slowly unfold it's our show its true shape and like if you don't I
1178680	1182420	don't know if you read any of the manual or anything like before you started like
1182420	1187280	like falsie and lost you know let's see and stuff like that I was like what the
1187280	1193520	fuck are they talking about turn subtitles on interjection just a fucking
1193520	1196840	interject I'm currently not listening to this because I haven't played it yet and
1196840	1200800	I'm trying to keep the spoiler for I'm not gonna get story but I'm and I want
1200800	1204600	to be completely surprised so I'm I will give little spoilers about the battle
1204600	1208920	system I am zoning the fuck out okay fucking zone out all you want sorry
1208920	1213440	lucky what we say no it is confusing and I do have the subtitles and stuff turned
1213440	1217040	on because you know I don't want to in the my audio whatever cuz I have the
1217040	1222520	five-one headphones or whatever it's very digital sounding it's like a lot of
1222520	1226660	like it's too loud almost like you're like I'm listening to it and at a
1226660	1230120	drive-in theater through one of those really shitty speakers is what it sounds
1230120	1233160	like well here's the thing they're talking to a lot of it starts to make
1233160	1236760	more sense as it goes on the way the storytelling is in this game again I'm
1236760	1240660	not gonna spoil the story itself but the way the storytelling is I draw a lot of
1240660	1245540	comparisons to the TV show lost or you kind of find things out slowly but
1245540	1250240	surely and then a lot is explained through flashbacks like the very opening
1250240	1253940	sequence of the game you're like oh this is just like Final Fantasy 7 people on a
1253940	1258120	fucking train all over again right but you find out the motivations and while
1258120	1262520	that happens through flashbacks that occur in the story so there's a lot of
1262520	1265800	similarities I think between like watching lost on TV but you know how
1265800	1269800	lost kind of divides people like some people are like I this this shows too
1269800	1272760	fucking slow for me they need to get to the fucking point already that's gonna
1272760	1276000	be what makes or breaks people if I'm has he 13 I think as well is that if
1276000	1278400	you're not willing to make that investment and kind of approach this is
1278400	1282800	like a miniseries or kind of you know something like lost like I don't see how
1282800	1286280	you could like a show like lost and then hate the way the story is in this game
1286280	1290760	because it takes fucking forever for things to happen in lost and it takes a
1290760	1293760	little while for things to happen in this game it's it's kind of the same I
1293760	1299080	want to speak really quickly about the battle system real quick okay Final
1299080	1303120	Fantasy and introduces this new thing called paradigm shifts and the easiest
1303120	1306260	fucking way I could explain it is that imagine you could flip your character
1306260	1309960	from a black white mage to a white mage right in the middle of battle that's
1309960	1313520	what the paradigm shifts are all about and it's a lot cooler than I think I'm
1313520	1316160	making it sound because like you know you might be doing a battle and you're
1316160	1319320	trying to chain things to get the monster to kind of slip into this mode
1319320	1322280	where it's easier to hit it and then all of a sudden you're like oh shit I'm low
1322280	1326720	on HP I better paradigm shift so I suddenly get a medic in my party and
1326720	1330080	also maybe somebody that casts barrier and all that shit to protect people and
1330080	1333640	then once everybody's cured up go back to assault yeah because you're really
1333640	1337040	fucking off you're really only controlling the first character in the
1337040	1340840	in each party so you're only controlling the party leader at the rest of them
1340840	1345800	you're kind of having to give like different jobs to and they basically do
1345800	1350280	it um going to our chat room at chat orange lounge radio.com Bo fuck you
1350280	1356160	which kawa says so it's fucking x2 it's a lot more fluid than x2 you know x2 had
1356160	1360240	those big big big animations with the dresh fears and everything it's a lot
1360240	1364000	quicker than that it's not so over the top like it was in x2 it feels a lot
1364000	1367520	more fluid I'm gonna say the battle system in 13 to me feels a little bit
1367520	1371960	more like an action game it takes active time battle to the next level it is like
1371960	1376320	fast paced it is very fucking and ever like you know much like the other final
1376320	1380560	fantasy games you know to get a preemptive strike or whatever is kind of
1380560	1384800	random whereas this you actually can sneak up on enemies because they have
1384800	1389680	like their own you know visual arc that they have their line of sight or
1389680	1393800	whatever and you can if you sneak up around them you can actually you know do
1393800	1396920	preemptive strikes that way and it works a little bit different to where you
1396920	1401040	don't necessarily do damage to them but it jumps that combo up so that you can
1401040	1405440	do more damage to them later on good good question really fucking great
1405440	1409520	question from yyr in chat says so does this mean you don't have to use any
1409520	1413760	strategy when choosing your party because you can swap at any time so far
1413760	1416780	and again granted I'm only five and a half hours in right now for those that
1416780	1420360	are playing the game I'm in a place called thing it's called the valley of
1420360	1423420	ruin is what it's called oh that's all I say I don't want to spoil stories or
1423420	1428440	whatever you don't have control over who's in your party people switch in and
1428440	1433840	out based on the story in fact there's a lot of these people are over here and
1433840	1437200	these people are over here these people are over here and their paths intersect
1437200	1441300	once in a while there's a lot of that going on early on in the game so you
1441300	1444300	don't really have a lot of control over your party. I think later on you'll be
1444300	1447700	able to control that more and also don't worry the way the XP works is very
1447700	1450980	similar to Ten's experience system where you're kind of moving around the board
1450980	1454560	spending points and... That was a little confusing too because I was trying to figure out
1454560	1457220	I was like trying because they're all yeah you pick the direction you want to
1457220	1459940	go and you hold this button down I'm like I want to go this way and it's
1459940	1463780	going the opposite direction I'm like no I want to go the other way it's all
1463780	1467060	right it makes it makes sense later on as you're using it it's very similar to
1467060	1471180	Ten's all your characters gain points when anyone in your party wins so it's
1471180	1473780	not like you're gonna have these obscenely under leveled characters
1473780	1477700	there are no levels for the characters there's there's no levels
1477700	1482020	there's no XP there's a but there you have kind of the Ten's system instead is
1482020	1486660	what you have in place of that there's no magic points which is a huge shift
1486660	1491620	there's something else they use instead of magic points but your characters are
1491620	1496180	gonna be flinging fire and arrow left and right with no consequence you have
1496180	1500660	to really think about that and there is um what else do I want to say there's no
1500660	1506020	magic and there's no oh and after every battle you're cured to full you don't
1506020	1511660	have to cure your party after battle you start heal everybody yeah it's a lot of
1511660	1516020	changes some people are not gonna like it but I say give it a chance I think
1516020	1519780	it's a lot of fucking fun and I'm five and a half hours in I am hooked hooked
1519780	1524540	hooked hooked I want to you guys know I have fucking gamer a DD really fucking
1524540	1528180	bad I'm always like ooh shiny I want to go play this fucking blur beta or I'm
1528180	1531340	gonna go play game room or something I will see this game out to completion I
1531340	1537540	will I know I will I think the story is actually pretty good yeah I like it but
1537540	1544140	if you really really hated the characters in seven you might hate these
1544140	1549100	guys too so just a word of caution because I see a lot of similarities and
1549100	1553780	I don't want to fall down the path of like the really nerdy you know gamer
1553780	1558380	that's you know virgin in his you know basement that's and stuff because we
1558380	1562700	know that's not really the truth of me fuck those stereotypes but here's what
1562700	1569420	I'm saying dude and I feel really wrong saying this but Vanille it's fucking hot
1569420	1576420	like it's like what the fuck 15 that is gross fucking pedophiles dream it's
1576420	1580940	seriously it's like it's like oh not to spoil anything where'd you get your
1580940	1587260	seal oh it's right here my upper thigh like oh come on yeah that was Alan and I
1587260	1591020	were both like just had that big reaction of oh I feel dirty oh oh god
1591020	1597100	that was dirty oh god what's up with her voice actor or actress I should say it's
1597100	1604300	just like got an accent and she's I don't even know what's wrong but it's
1604300	1608140	weird it's just seriously weird it's like oh the one thing and I'll wrap this
1608140	1610980	up because I know Jamie's like I want to talk about something else I was doing my
1610980	1614340	fucking laundry okay but well I just want to say this really quick one thing
1614340	1618020	that just blew me the fuck away when I was playing this game like seriously
1618020	1621700	it's the little things that count well two things a when you fucking load your
1621700	1626220	game after having taken an hour break or something you get a fucking explanation
1626220	1629300	of where you're at in the story so you can remember where the fuck you left off
1629300	1634060	which is great like just it's a lip it's little things that count also blew me
1634060	1640980	the fuck away you ready the lips are in sync with the English dialogue that's
1640980	1646180	right that it is not a really bad dub they did that with 10-2 though did they
1646180	1649940	I didn't play enough of 10-2 I watched some people also didn't really get in
1649940	1654880	mind that the ending cinemas actually a lot of the cinemas were re-synced to
1654880	1660060	also fit the English dialogue and the end sequence the little song that unit
1660060	1664620	gets up and sing was completely reanimated I was fucking blown away by
1664620	1667860	the like it's those little things that just made me go whoa and by the way
1667860	1672580	since it hasn't really been mentioned yet the game is fucking gorgeous it is a
1672580	1676840	beautiful beautiful game and I know I've seen those reports others say no the
1676840	1682820	360 version looks worse than the ps3 who cares play the fucking game I don't care
1682820	1686820	what system you get it on that we're getting the ps3 one and that's what I
1686820	1692620	got to but I was just I just knew the 360 was a port and I you know what I
1692620	1699460	just I wanted my achievement points did you go 360 yes I did I went 360 okay I
1699460	1703860	have is no no biggie as three discs and you know what though I mean honestly how
1703860	1708340	often am I gonna be shifting new discs around what whenever I get to that point
1708340	1713740	oh my god I have to put another disc in the machine I feel so old you'll be
1713740	1718300	amazed at how fucking much they probably squeezed onto one disc it it's just it's
1718300	1724700	a beautiful game it is so like I just blown away by some of the visuals and
1724700	1728580	like it's not all just like the industrial looks that you've seen in
1728580	1732220	the trailers and things it is a well fuck it was funny my friend you know

1958780	1961300	to last week's show it's all fucking explained there but there's a game on
1961300	1965580	Steam called what what the fuck is it secrets of the magic crystal and it's a
1965580	1969380	game that looks like you're breeding unicorns or some fucking bullshit but
1969380	1972780	one of the items that you're using if you look at the various screenshots one
1972780	1976260	of the items you use in your fucking horse breeding has these little pink
1976260	1981660	bars and they're called anus a en us so we officially have fucking called this
1981660	1987820	the pink anus game because it's funny and you get to say anus and you're not
1987820	1992620	being vulgar you're just talking about what's in a video game so there you
1992620	1996900	fucking go there's some explanation on what's going on all right um let's see
1996900	1999980	what other fucking housekeeping do I have fucking why aren't you fucking
1999980	2004340	following us on Twitter and Facebook and all that stuff twitter.com slash olr
2004340	2007300	we'll take your fucking Twitter questions later you know because it is
2007300	2011980	the show where every fucking gamer has a voice even when that voice is very vulgar
2011980	2016020	we also have our Facebook at orange lounge radio we have a myspace too but I
2016020	2018380	haven't logged in there for like fucking three months but I guess I should check
2018380	2022660	on that yeah I really should just go to the fucking website orange lounge radio
2022660	2026940	com it's great we got you know these two guys chase VX Jason XV and deep man
2026940	2029620	worked very fucking hard on the website by the way deep man speaking of the
2029620	2033820	website I need to fucking say this real quick fucking deep man posted a fucking
2033820	2037900	great little exposition on a game I don't know a fucking lot about but it's
2037900	2041420	Yakuza 3 I haven't really been fucking following this very closely because I
2041420	2044460	didn't really play Yakuza 1 or Yakuza 2 but I still found deep man's article
2044460	2047580	very fucking interesting because Sega made all these fucking localization
2047580	2051420	changes to Yakuza 3 that have people pissed off and I think deep man does a
2051420	2054500	very fucking good job of running it down and I'm also just kind of fucking
2054500	2057540	appreciative that there's like actual content on our website besides just the

2145660	2151940	Rob will say that he will literally say quote the f-word end quote or f that

2161580	2165980	please makes it nice please makes it very fucking nice but here's the other
2165980	2169900	thing to keep in mind is that I bet anything there's gonna be one of those
2169900	2173660	fucking like podcasts that reviews other podcasts or something or some fucking
2173660	2178060	asshole on his blogs and say listen the orange lounge radio and all they did was
2178060	2183300	say fuck cuz they're just stupid and can't think of anything else to say
2183300	2189620	you other podcasts that seems like again waste again we are protesting the
2189620	2196180	anti-cussing week that our government has seen fit to waste fucking money and
2196180	2201260	time voting upon when we are in the middle of what we've hit budget crisis
2201260	2205780	besides the sides are fucking going out on the freeway and getting like
2205780	2209460	threatening to get fucking run over by cars in protest of how bad the fees have
2209460	2214020	gone to universities and I mean I'm a student myself and even going to junior
2214020	2217380	college right now is fucking expensive and come on look at how bad the fucking
2217380	2221540	universities are if these students think that that's a good idea running around
2221540	2225860	on the freeway didn't they fucking learn that and like preschool here's the thing
2225860	2229740	I think we should have a 60 star loving what I need the ol army and the people
2229740	2233340	that get it tonight you fucking cool kids that are understanding the show
2233340	2238380	tonight if you see this shit out there on the internet somewhere fucking tear
2238380	2242300	them a new asshole because honestly fucking independent people should be
2242300	2245620	supporting each other not tearing each other down I don't fucking talk bad
2245620	2249020	about independent podcast open fucking season on those that get paid to do it
2249020	2254180	in the core podcast though I will I will rip them apart but indie podcasts need
2254180	2258340	to fucking help each other out and if I may make my own statement about that and
2258340	2262660	this goes even on an individual basis usually when someone puts down somebody
2262660	2266100	else without giving any constructive feedback it's because they are having
2266100	2271820	issues with themselves low fucking self-esteem leads to bitchiness sorry
2271820	2276580	haven't you noticed that usually the people who are the loudest or certain
2276580	2281660	people who are um anti-gay I was just fucking that that happened in our
2281660	2287780	backyard at main national news right huge fucking anti-gay Republican no no
2287780	2291420	I shouldn't there are some cool Republicans believe it or not it's just
2291420	2293980	the wrong fucking people are in control of that party right now like Meghan
2293980	2298460	McCain I'm down with her she is a cool Republican but yeah idiots like this guy
2298460	2303220	who fucking voted you know yes on a and then fucking has all this legislation
2303220	2307740	it's fucking anti-gay gets caught at faces a gay bar the Jamie and I have
2307740	2314380	fucking gone to this place makes gay look straight I've been there coming
2314380	2318540	back from fucking faces with another guy in his car I mean anyway sorry we need
2318540	2323820	to go back and do karaoke at faces that would be a lot of fun I actually I
2323820	2330620	actually though did have another point with this is that you know it's not
2330620	2333940	really just the budget crisis that haven't we hit what is it somewhere
2333940	2338660	between 14 and 17 percent statewide unemployment so people there's no fucking
2338660	2342260	jobs out there yet instead of doing things you know to help people get jobs
2342260	2349140	to create new programs they're wasting their time and effort on safeguarding
2349140	2355460	morality which is an individual choice so to our government right now fuck you
2355460	2360460	in your ear because your ass is not good enough come some quick fucking comments
2360460	2365140	from chat hardcore 77 once note says both Republicans and Democrats are
2365140	2369060	corrupt I fucking agree with that honestly because the budget crisis we
2369060	2372060	have in the state right now it's everybody's fucking fault no I totally
2372060	2374660	agree you know I think part of the problem I got hate going back to the
2374660	2378780	political topic sorry it needs to be said it needs to be said the part of the
2378780	2383780	problem is that we are so stuck in this bipartisan you know system I mean I'm
2383780	2387980	sure if you ask anybody it's even on public sites to say America has a
2387980	2392420	two-party system that's a fucking lie we do have independent political parties
2392420	2396220	it's just the Democrats and the Republicans are the ones with the money
2396220	2401220	to spend on it and the independence fall to the wayside you know it's the only
2401220	2409180	that is the reason why I wish that Perot had won I'm saying that is I get for
2409180	2413460	what for what he fucking stood for I get it I get for what he would do for the
2413460	2418180	I think morale I'd pick but okay he's the one I would have picked but I'm
2418180	2425820	saying that as an independent who came to me exactly you know four years vote
2425820	2428780	him out you know at least you know business won't be fucked up he's a
2428780	2434540	businessman but I'm saying that I would like to see the wall shattered I'd see
2434540	2438900	people break out of their little voting strict Republican because oh they're
2438900	2444180	Republican I want people to this is why I get an absentee balance every ballot
2444180	2449260	ballot every fucking year because I go through my ballot item by item look up
2449260	2454060	each of the people in the comfort of my home without having to waste time at the
2454060	2457500	booth or anything without people breathing down my neck and see who
2457500	2461660	everyone is and vote for somebody with a well-informed choice so I'm just saying
2461660	2468460	Oh full ticket okay I got I'm sorry that's okay it's a we fucking say
2468460	2471220	things that aren't fucking I mean this whole show tonight is not fucking
2471220	2475100	necessarily about video games but um where was I at also Oh liquid parrot in
2475100	2479300	chat I had a really fucking good comment what podcast is talking trash about my
2479300	2485220	beloved olr no one is yet it's just that I'm on Google alerts because I'm fucking
2485220	2487980	narcissistic right and I want to see everybody who's talking about orange
2487980	2490940	lounge radio no I don't I don't consider that narcissistic I just consider that
2490940	2493100	running a good business you want to know what's being said about you on the
2493100	2497260	internet and sometimes I'll see these fucking blogs from people writing their
2497260	2501700	individual blogs like podcasts I subscribe to and I unsubscribed from
2501700	2505700	orange lounge radio this week because I find them very annoying and the girl
2505700	2509780	talks too much and and the guy is too gay and the other guy is too angry and
2509780	2515300	blah blah like just shut the fuck up talk about a podcast you do like it
2515300	2520220	nobody reads your fucking blog because you're so fucking negative that's the
2520220	2525980	thing anyhow but as far as far as I know the other podcasts are cool if somebody
2525980	2530980	is talking about us I don't know yet but if I find out it's fucking on all right
2530980	2537020	anyhow how about 45 minutes in the show and now some fucking gaming news right
2537020	2544220	Loki all right let's get into this um so there's this bug that fucking popped up
2544220	2548100	last week we thought it was you know maybe someone hacking the fucking
2548100	2551900	PlayStation Network or something like that which that still begs the question
2551900	2555020	what the hell was that web page then that said you know hey turn off your
2555020	2559940	turn on your fucking Java and your whatever so I don't know what that was
2559940	2565180	but anyways this was completely unrelated all apparently the most of the
2565180	2570260	fat PlayStation threes the old style ones had trouble connecting to the
2570260	2576140	PlayStation Network due to a bug in one of the arm chips and apparently this was
2576140	2581220	caused by the PlayStation 3 thinking apparently that it was a leap year when
2581220	2586980	it wasn't and it became unsinked and so because of this you know date time you
2586980	2592180	know desynchronization it was unable to connect to the PlayStation Network as a
2592180	2598740	like a precaution the safety precaution or something anyways within you know a
2598740	2603260	little amount of time it was actually fixed basically the only advice they
2603260	2607340	fucking gave was don't turn your system on because you know you may lose your
2607340	2612100	trophies and you know you're some games you may not work in blah blah blah my
2612100	2616380	favorite was how when it was all fucking over they were like we fucking fixed it
2616380	2619260	it's okay to turn on your fucking PlayStations now and they didn't do a
2619260	2623880	goddamn thing they just waited it out that's all they did they didn't fucking
2623880	2628260	fix it they just it was it was a bug in the date and as soon as the date changed
2628260	2634700	all better so some somebody fucked up and thought 2010 was a leap year and
2634700	2637820	somehow that made it in the old fucking PlayStation here's here's my fucking
2637820	2643300	problem with that is apparently the those chips were actually the same chips
2643300	2648980	that were in the zooms and you may not remember the end of 2008 I think when a
2648980	2653540	switched over the end of the year they like fucking New Year's yeah it was like
2653540	2657860	New Year's and all the students stopped working because of the arm CPU chip and
2657860	2661300	apparently there's a date bug in that too and oh guess what the same chip was
2661300	2666020	actually inside you know the PlayStation 3 all along and it was a known problem
2666020	2674060	but they just kind of we forgot all about it you have fuck soon I don't
2674060	2682620	didn't well I don't have one anymore times get tough but yes I mean you know
2682620	2686980	you don't really want your whatever to stop working all of a sudden because oh
2686980	2694500	we didn't realize there's a bug in here and that's a problem I don't know and it
2694500	2697500	doesn't look good when your console stop fucking working the only advice they can
2697500	2703860	give you is don't play guess what Sony I was already not doing that or doing that
2703860	2707980	whatever I know don't play your ps3 for a day okay I can fucking do that that's
2707980	2714500	very easy so um what the what the fuck else is I gonna say about this oh here's
2714500	2718260	the thing yes Sony is is wearing a lot of fucking egg on their face for this
2718260	2721580	colossal fuck up and you know a lot of people are razzing them this week and
2721580	2728660	rightfully so but honestly is the red ring of death any fucking better I'd
2728660	2734020	rather have all the ps3s go down for a day and have it be all you know hunky
2734020	2740580	dory afterwards and have all the 360s go down permanently but but I will say this
2740580	2744580	it does kind of show that it's kind of fucked up that when something like this
2744580	2748300	happens I can't fucking play heavy rain or some of the other games that connect
2748300	2752700	to the network their needs it's very reminiscent of that very controversial
2752700	2756900	Ubisoft DRM that I know we're going to get into later in the show but it just
2756900	2761860	fucking strikes me as like a little hint of that and I do not like that do not
2761860	2766900	fucking want so there's a piece of me that's like Sony doesn't need to fucking
2766900	2772420	fix the date issue Sony needs to fucking fix the I can't play my games online if
2772420	2776100	something is broken on their end issue that's the fucking problem well here's
2776100	2779620	the other fucking thing that it's really bad is since they didn't really do
2779620	2783220	anything I mean is this actually gonna get passed out or like four years from
2783220	2787660	now are we gonna run in the same fucking problem again I will forget about it
2787660	2792940	it's okay oh yeah you remember that one time that all those ps3s went fucking
2792940	2799100	down yeah it's gonna happen again cuz it's not a leap year but try telling
2799100	2808340	that to the PlayStation it makes whatever year it wants fucking leap so
2808340	2814020	well is there a fucking possibility this is gonna happen in the future I don't
2814020	2816860	think it will be because they'll be probably patched out let's put it
2816860	2823380	something to ignore it all right in other fucking Sony news we have news
2823380	2826380	about their fucking motion controller that's been kind of quiet ever since the
2826380	2829660	last e3 but I'm assuming that it's because they're gonna have some fucking
2829660	2836220	new news this year at e3 but the term PlayStation arc has been fucking
2836220	2841260	trademarked in Japan so you know we were calling the fucking ice cream cones that
2841260	2846020	light up as you wave them around like a freak apparently is gonna be called the
2846020	2850180	PlayStation arc which is not like these fucking new news because you know they
2850180	2853140	might remember there was a story earlier in the year where this fucking guy I
2853140	2859300	think at THQ had said the name earlier anyway so PlayStation arc sounds like
2859300	2864500	it's gonna be the fucking name but we'll see now also to kind of take that a step
2864500	2869340	further apparently Konami has a trademarked a game name and it's called
2869340	2876060	Gradius arc you know what I this is you know just me thinking out of my ass but
2876060	2879900	um you know what I think arc could stand for
2879900	2887300	augmentive reality controller oh look at you look at me my fucking acronyms yeah
2887300	2892220	yeah I mean there's only unintelligent people swear I like that I think you're
2892220	2895260	right I think fucking arc is an acronym for something I think that's a very
2895260	2898820	fucking realistic because all the stuff that they were showing in like their
2898820	2903420	demos were augmented reality demos either that or it's gonna be specific
2903420	2910020	for all arc the lad games I somehow really fucking doubt that or you'll
2910020	2915740	build a stick two of each animal into that controller shut up it will be the
2915740	2920820	controller how the fuck will that work playing fucking Gradius with a motion
2920820	2924140	controller do you fucking just flail around to move your fucking ship all
2924140	2927420	around and then pew pew pew with your button like I don't fucking understand
2927420	2930940	that how does how is Gradius gonna incorporate motion control that makes no
2930940	2936860	sense oh by the way Becky just alerted me to something what's that that um cuss
2936860	2942980	free week did not pass the Senate no it was it was on the news and everything
2942980	2949980	oh I'll see if I can get her to send me a link maybe there's more well still
2949980	2953500	still it doesn't matter because it doesn't matter the fucking point still
2953500	2958140	stands whether it passed or not because they wasted their fucking time actually
2958140	2962100	voting on this it's even worse if it didn't fucking pass because they wasted
2962100	2969620	all the fucking time for fucking nothing so fuck them yeah any attack on my free
2969620	2973220	I don't know how you would fucking play Gradius though with a motion controller
2973220	2978380	the only thing I could think of is that maybe you control the options that way
2978380	2983420	or something I don't know me I flail around and knock the ships out of the
2983420	2989060	way it sounds dumb well name but the thing sounds dumb they also passed they
2989060	2995020	did pass California acupuncture day what the fuck I am not even gonna try to
2995020	2999500	dignify that one let's move on to another fucking news story dark Sakura
2999500	3003060	what the fuck you have for us well I have something and I actually just
3003060	3010940	posted pictures up on our fucking website there are ESRB listings for ps3
3010940	3016080	and PSP games there is alpha mission 2 baseball stars professional league
3016080	3020900	bowling and super sidekicks which are all neogeo titles to pop up on the PSN
3020900	3026700	so maybe we would see them and you know as soon as I saw the little capture
3026700	3032180	caption on the on destructoid I had to go grab my game and take a picture that
3032180	3037020	is a big fucking box for a video game it is god bless those games fucking stars
3037020	3042420	oh and by the way paid 48 bucks for it yikes yeah but keep in mind how much we
3042420	3045900	paid for fucking king of fighters 2000 that's true weren't those fucking games
3045900	3051460	like fucking $200 and they first we paid 350 for it but at the time all the
3051460	3055540	others were the other sites were selling it for about 400 so we got a really good
3055540	3063140	fucking deal on it all right yeah um some some fucking clarifications in our
3063140	3065780	chat room because of course they the chat room gets all sicked on it and
3065780	3070540	everything it did fucking pass the assembly but it was rejected in the
3070540	3075300	Senate is there like a high crisis my point still stands it was a waste of
3075300	3078820	fucking time no matter what happened and that this was even allowed to get
3078820	3082680	somewhere and that people are fucking listening to this guy and you know what
3082680	3086060	they stand for and everything so point still stands and besides you all have
3086060	3089160	been one in the fucking fuck show for like a year and a half this is a good
3089160	3092100	fucking reason the jokes been running for like a year and a half so now is as
3092100	3099840	good of a time as any all right Loki yes so apparently there's been a whole lot
3099840	3106780	of drama going on with Activision this week earlier this week Activision had I
3106780	3114420	guess let go the two the two leads over at infinity Ward
3114420	3123100	Vince Zappanella and Jason West and these two studio heads just all the
3123100	3128780	sudden aren't working there anymore and now more and more information you know
3128780	3134500	kind of came out about that and apparently it was according to a bunch
3134500	3139940	of lawsuits here because now they're filing lawsuits against Activision for
3139940	3145860	unpaid royalties apparently these guys you know they did all their hard work on
3145860	3149740	modern warfare 2 or whatever and Activision wanted them you know they're
3149740	3154660	kind of strong arming them into making you know the next modern warfare game or
3154660	3159220	whatever next you know war game take place in Vietnam and whatever the case
3159220	3164380	may be but to get out of paying them royalties they decided to go ahead and
3164380	3171580	let them go and so it's kind of interesting now of course they their
3171580	3174780	comments on it we were shocked by Activision's decision to terminate our
3174780	3179620	contracts we poured our heart and soul into that company building not only a
3179620	3183340	world-class development studio but assembling a team we've been proud to
3183340	3187700	work with for nearly a decade we think that the work we've done speaks for
3187700	3192460	itself and it says after all um all we have given Activision we shouldn't have
3192460	3199260	to sue to get paid and of course Activision you know responding to their
3199260	3203060	lawsuit they say that they're disappointed in the lawsuit and that
3203060	3208300	it's meritless says Activision is disappointed that mr. as Zamper Ella and
3208300	3213580	mr. West have chosen to file a lawsuit with and believes their claims are
3213580	3217500	meritless over eight years Activision shareholders provided these executives
3217500	3221700	with their capital they needed to start in Finney Ward so basically they say hey
3221700	3226540	we made you now we can break you as well as financial support resources and
3226540	3229860	creative independence that helped them flourish and achieve enormous
3229860	3233820	professional success and personal yes because if they didn't give them money
3233820	3237780	I'm sure that they couldn't create these wonderful games is what they're saying
3237780	3242980	you know granted that studios do need you know money to get going but I think
3242980	3246140	it's just a creative talent behind it that creates the games anyways I
3246140	3250060	continues in return Activision legitimately expected them to honor
3250060	3254460	their obligations to Activision just like any other executives who hold
3254460	3258700	positions and trust in the company while the company showed enormous patience it
3258700	3262220	firmly believes its decision was justified based on the courses of
3262220	3269220	conduct and act actions basically long story short they were unhappy with what
3269220	3274300	was going on with Activision and so they were the rumor is that they were kind of
3274300	3277840	shopping around elsewhere not the only ones that are kind of had their fucking
3277840	3280940	fill of Activision and that's for sure can I read this quick comment from chat
3280940	3284740	from odd fuck again the opinions in our chat room are not necessarily those of
3284740	3288180	us here on the show but here's odd fuck in our chat room Bobby Kotek needs to
3288180	3291180	die in a fucking fire with fucking fire ants on his face while everyone fucking
3291180	3297220	pisses on him might be a little bit extreme but but isn't tonight all about
3297220	3302080	extremes um here's the thing though I I kind of fucking believe this guy's days
3302080	3306400	this guy's days are numbered Activision has such a fucking bad rap right now
3306400	3311020	there has been just like this one two three four punch you have the fucking
3311020	3315940	king's quest game gets shut down you have the fucking all these subsidies of
3315940	3319180	Activision getting shut down all the stuff that's fucking going on now with
3319180	3323340	you know their biggest selling game I mean the Bobby Kotek is looks like a
3323340	3328120	fucking buffoon right now like if I were a shareholder I would be demanding some
3328120	3333020	fucking answers and calling for some fucking you know I I just think it's
3333020	3337820	they look stupid and unfortunately you know if infinity what it would comes
3337820	3343700	down to is if infinity ward ends up you know dissolving or whatever me though
3343700	3347900	let's move on to because they were before they were behind Medal of Honor
3347900	3351420	and stuff they were working on that series and they left to go form you know
3351420	3356700	this new company basically to you know create the Call of Duty series and the
3356700	3360740	Call of Duty series has been really awesome but you know if they're gonna be
3360740	3364420	treated like dicks I mean come on Activision's been so awful now that
3364420	3368900	they're making EA look fucking awesome I want to address some fucking good points
3368900	3372420	in chat shadow fucking runner says Robert they still making money and why
3372420	3375140	oh I are says Rob it doesn't matter people are still buying their products
3375140	3378620	in droves the shareholders demands results well hold on guys because all
3378620	3381740	this fucking stuff has come out like literally within the past couple weeks
3381740	3384340	and although we've kind of known Activision's I'm going down a shady
3384340	3387260	path for a while this whole one-two punch I'm talking about is just in the
3387260	3392060	past couple weeks so you're gonna I don't mean he's gonna fucking get you
3392060	3397380	know pulled from the board tomorrow but wait about six months to a year wait a
3397380	3401860	little while and see when that next modern warfare games comes out if it's
3401860	3407340	not fucking up to par it's over if guitar hero sucks it's over they're done
3407340	3410900	guitar hero is done for if the next fucking game sucks you know what I mean
3410900	3415060	wait for kind of you kind of have to wait to see how this all plays out but
3415060	3420460	if some of these decisions lead to really bad things the holiday season
3420460	3424660	just look it will have a you how they treat their franchises I mean Call of
3424660	3429100	Duty they're putting out new ones every year I mean they're basically the whole
3429100	3432660	reason they even you know take on you know brutal legend that kind of stuff
3432660	3437340	and Ghostbusters well we can't figure out a way to pump out a new game every
3437340	3442500	year in this franchise so we're just not gonna take it and then same with guitar
3442500	3446260	hero I mean look how they're treating like download content stuff very little
3446260	3452140	each month and look at DJ here what Wow two download packs thanks thanks a lot
3452140	3456620	way to support it I will fucking say this though you do have a fucking point
3456620	3459780	that it's about the money they can do all the fucking dickhead things they
3459780	3464300	want in the world in the end it's about the money but my little but with that is
3464300	3468940	or my big but depending on whatever you want to look at it as don't
3468940	3475580	underestimate the the gamers and the kind of the impact that all that
3475580	3479780	negative press on all the blogs and shit can have I could be wrong and that's
3479780	3483420	fucking fine I think it's gonna come down unfortunately it's gonna fucking be
3483420	3487980	just like you know the protests or whatever what Call of Duty you know how
3487980	3491540	they're saying oh we're protesting this game we're not gonna fucking buy it yeah
3491540	3495900	and sure enough everyone's buying it you know or you know the Left 4 Dead thing
3495900	3498820	of course that's a different company but still you know remember fucking the
3498820	3502940	Left 4 Dead fucking thing on Steam that all the fucking people were playing
3502940	3506940	Left 4 Dead 2 where they got the screenshot yeah same same story so if
3506940	3510100	you really fucking mean it if you're really fucking you pissed off that these
3510100	3514580	guys got fired for all their hard work then you need to stop fucking buying the
3514580	3518700	games just stop don't buy the next Call of Duty game it's not gonna be an
3518700	3523260	infinity Ward game anyways I mean that's if you want to wait the way you want to
3523260	3526540	look at it I mean look at they're gonna put Treyarch and you know charge of it
3526540	3531020	and unfortunately Treyarch is just not as good as Infinity Ward I mean people
3531020	3539740	even know that I just I don't know just you know vote with your money all right
3539740	3545860	let's talk about some fucking titties how's that sound perk there's there's
3545860	3550340	one thing better than freedom of speech it's nudity and there's some titties to
3550340	3554860	be found in fucking heavy rain here's the deal I won't try to spoil the story
3554860	3558540	too bad but there is a love scene that happens at one point in the game you
3558540	3561100	know should be fucking obvious if you've seen some of the previous of the game
3561100	3564980	that it kind of pushed the envelope so there's a love scene now if you decline
3564980	3570780	the kiss and trigger the sequence anyway and reload your saved game right away
3570780	3575860	then you'll have the female lead running around titties flapping around
3575860	3580860	everything is all just hanging out so there you go you can run around and play
3580860	3588300	naked now of course the naked model was not made in the game to be run around
3588300	3593100	and play naked well but there's a shower scene that happens in the in the oh I saw
3593100	3598140	this what's interesting here here's the fucking part I think is interesting
3598140	3600780	though is that you know since everybody gets all fucking bent out of shape
3600780	3604820	because a nudity specifically the ESRB is this game gonna go back to the board
3604820	3607820	for an AO rating isn't this the same fucking thing that happened in oblivion
3607820	3612660	for the PC version ended up getting pulled and fucking rated AO because even
3612660	3617700	though you weren't supposed to be able to ever see the titties the titties were
3617700	3623580	there because they fucking would use them to base like a sheer top on I think
3623580	3628580	though that it's still okay because you actually do see that model in the game
3628580	3632060	it's just now that you're using that model for more than just that one scene
3632060	3636220	but isn't I mean for whatever reason I think it's fucking stupid but the the
3636220	3639820	fucks out there the rate things are like there's a big difference between a butt
3639820	3644580	and a pussy yeah but if they didn't all that is is 100 here's the thing if they
3644580	3648980	didn't if that model wasn't in the game if it was just like you know she's
3648980	3651980	behind a shower curtain or something like that and they're just using that
3651980	3656740	model or whatever for like a silhouette or something that's different but you
3656740	3660600	actually use this model in the game for one of the scenes you actually see her
3660600	3665540	completely naked so it's just if they're gonna you know are you anything it's
3665540	3670340	gonna be fucking duration why didn't they just do like the Sims pixel thing
3670340	3675540	watch I miss fucking cleo right here watch next week on the fucking show
3675540	3680620	there's gonna be a story about some mother filing a fucking lawsuit against
3680620	3685660	because they fucking found this in the game because their kid read about this
3685660	3689500	on the internet on one of the gaming blogs so they fucking go in and unlock
3689500	3692720	the character and suddenly mom walks in and there's some fucking titties on the
3692720	3696060	screen and she fucking loses her shit not knowing that that's the game she
3696060	3700340	bought for her kid and there's a fucking lawsuit next week's show that'll be a
3700340	3706340	story if not next week two weeks but the bodies in the game already it would be
3706340	3712740	just the same badge and everything it would be just the same is if they he
3712740	3718460	didn't there's a lot or whatever and um you know nope no if they didn't do the
3718460	3724420	mod or whatever and just the shower scene it would be exactly the same I
3724420	3728660	hope you're right that there's no basis but I don't know her boobs don't move
3728660	3732220	like real boobs I have a feeling well I don't think you were ever supposed to be
3732220	3735600	able to just fucking walk her around and shit like that yeah uncanny valley my
3735600	3743420	ass I'm sorry that doesn't all look real we need some real looking titties we
3743420	3748500	need to we need team ninja to fix this yeah yeah range of motion in the face
3748500	3754460	but where is the range of motion in the fucking titties not rare dark soccer has
3754460	3756920	got a fucking new story for us then we'll get into some fucking release
3756920	3763540	dates yes fucking story happy fucking birthday PlayStation 2 dude I totally
3763540	3770420	want someone to make me a ps2 cake that'd be cool anyway um yeah ten years
3770420	3778500	ago ps2 launched in Japan yay um I have a Japanese ps2 me too I have the first
3778500	3782340	model one and it still works I bought mine I don't even know if mine still
3782340	3785000	fucking works I haven't touched it in years I bought it a little ways later I
3785000	3789500	bought it for beat me in a 2d x6 style because I was fucking addicted to 2d x
3789500	3794040	I think that's what we got ours for too and that and playing some of some of the
3794040	3797820	the few JRPGs that I had some of the fucking cool kids in town they had their
3797820	3801900	ps2 is for third and fourth style I didn't get on that train till about six
3801900	3805500	thousand and first they can beat me in a game the big thing that gets me on this
3805500	3809220	one is that there actually are people that still use their ps2 there's still
3809220	3815100	ps2 games being released so we're looking at a ten-year-old system it's
3815100	3818180	not funny that people never fucking believe that the PlayStation 3 has a
3818180	3822240	ten-year life cycle and people go that's too fucking long look at the ps2 it is
3822240	3826660	still fucking going after ten years yep yeah so a ten-year life cycle is very
3826660	3831740	valid at the end of its life cycle but yes it's so it needs to be put down you
3831740	3836700	know so a happy fucking birthday PlayStation 2 just just really fucking

3974180	3978140	might want to think about upgrading although I will say I do hope that the
3978140	3981400	fucking backwards compatibility comes to the PlayStation 3 at some point and I
3981400	3986300	know this is a big fucking wrap around I don't want to dread dirt mine has it I
3986300	3990460	know some of the old-ass systems do but by the time those systems break they're
3990460	3995220	gonna want to put out on the fucking marketplace ps2 games for download we
3995220	3999100	all know it's coming it's just a matter of when but the reason why I said put
3999100	4003060	out the reason why I somewhat welcome it I'm a little iffy on it I want to go
4003060	4006020	back and play Final Fantasy 12 again without having to hook up my ps2 you
4006020	4008660	want to know how many times I guess I would pay $20 to know how many
4008660	4012420	PlayStation 2 games I've played in my ps3 that's fully backwards compatible
4012420	4017980	zero zero I thought oh yeah I'm going to go back and play some grand theft auto

4045860	4052380	whopping zero none and you know why because I have an Xbox 360 I'm buying

4119020	4123740	Xbox 360 finally you know what how many years we've been waiting for that thing
4123740	4128220	uh funny enough is Final Fantasy 14 is coming out this year too Wow
4128220	4134060	it's a sign of the apocalypse maybe two Final Fantasy games in a year possibly
4134060	4140180	three I don't know um okay so other stuff coming out 50 classic games on the

4147420	4154820	stuff yay and slightly cheaper Sam max 2 beyond time and space coming out as a
4154820	4162340	compilation on PC and we case you didn't buy them all separately calling on the
4162340	4170060	Nintendo Wii which shares cover almost with final not Final Fantasy with
4170060	4178060	obsessed much are we yes Final Fantasy Final Fantasy no um now it shares a box
4178060	4184580	art with almost Silent Hill and it looks Silent Hill ish maybe but it's not
4184580	4191340	photo showdown for the DSI it's right DSI not DS it's a game sort of like
4191340	4196380	monster rancher except you use the pictures that you take with your DSI
4196380	4199420	camera and based on the colors that are in there it creates different monsters
4199420	4203900	not quite as cool as you know putting random CDs in your PlayStation 2 or
4203900	4208740	barcode scanner or the barcode scanner yes that's true we need to bring back
4208740	4218180	barcode scanners Assassin's Creed 2 on PC this week wait a second I'm confused
4218180	4222940	it's not supposed to be out yet right yeah people are complaining about not

4230540	4235500	coming out on the Wii it's Ubisoft's answer to Wii sports and it features all
4235500	4239780	different games you can play with rackets and they also have support for
4239780	4245060	the stupid camera that came with you self fitness because you know all those
4245060	4250060	games that use cameras for motion capture have been so awesome so far
4250060	4255420	granted the tall and you know the arc might be good but so far they sucked
4255420	4260940	yeah they're in game for girls it's a girly game where you play a little girl

4385220	4387900	don't know if it's like their answer to heavy rain or web it kind of just looks

4463660	4469140	RPG game on the PlayStation 2 again looks very anime heavy influenced
4469140	4473220	multi-hit combos though and some of the sequences some really kind of pretty
4473220	4479540	looking DVD ish style cutscenes and a very anime style looks like although
4479540	4483380	it's RPG it might be a little bit action-based in its battles there you
4483380	4490500	know they need to have more games with the word grand thesis in the title what
4490500	4494900	the fuck ever all right let's see other games coming out this week I'm checking

4510880	4513860	though but that's in Asia those are all in the fucking Sony PSP and I just need
4513860	4517780	to fucking remind everybody that is not part of the deal because the game makes
4517780	4523460	sense on a PSP because there's no camera peripheral all right and on the Nintendo
4523460	4530800	DS one really big game this week fucking worth noting RPG sukuru ds it's an RPG
4530800	4535540	maker game on the Nintendo DS so you know a lot of folks I know really you're
4535540	4538180	into those games that's kind of cool well unfortunately it's very Japanese
4538180	4541460	heavy so you're gonna have to I know your Japanese if you want to fucking
4541460	4544820	play this game or you're gonna need to bake somebody to localize it enter brain

4548900	4552380	here by the way although it's technically next week I should point out
4552380	4556300	the DS releases are thinning out a little bit because next week is Pokemon
4556300	4560060	heart gold and soul silver are on their way on the Nintendo DS we know everybody
4560060	4564820	fucking loves Pokemon so there you go that's it for Japan Dark Sakura what the
4564820	4571180	fuck for UK oh if you fucking odds and ends Final Fantasy 13 on the 9th on the
4571180	4578060	10th scrap metal for Xbox 360 12th is Benton alien force viljaks attacks what
4578060	4583740	the fuck is that last rebellion Warhammer 40k dawn of war 2 chaos rising
4583740	4589940	boo Warhammer okay you know what my problem with Warhammer is and Yakuza 3
4589940	4597300	that's all that there is all right some more fucking news than the classic game
4597300	4600660	of the week everybody fucking loves the classic game of the week and I'm sure
4600660	4604220	Dark Sakura picked a pretty fucking good one this week she usually does but just
4604220	4608060	a few more stories before we get there I know you could all use a break to wash
4608060	4614300	your mouths out with soap there's been some interesting fucking updates to the
4614300	4618700	game portal this week they had a couple updates did you see the cover of Game
4618700	4625660	Informer yes it did hmm jumping ahead of me here that's right so the first update
4625660	4632500	that was out there was a patch that added some more radio dialogue I guess
4632500	4638780	and there was some different messages that were in Morse code also some
4638780	4644620	encoded messages with the numbers and equations in them and this was all part
4644620	4648980	of like the radio that you would hear you know every now and then I think it
4648980	4653780	was also in the room that you started off in and it was all kind of hinting
4653780	4658300	different things now the people that looked at those images or whatever that
4658300	4665980	was in the little radio messages it's kind of funny they actually found a
4665980	4674180	phone number for a BBS you know those old things prior to the internet fucking
4674180	4681740	loved BBS's do yes you can't fucking trade wars 2002 what or was it 2020 I
4681740	4685060	don't remember but you know all those fucking games were amazing but I should
4685060	4689000	have the red fucking dragon enough said and then on of course those BBS's they
4689000	4695180	found you know ASCII art featuring some stuff looks like different robots and
4695180	4702180	whatever from possibly portal to very interesting looking some apparently this
4702180	4707740	is going to be some sort of ARG type of thing so that'll be kind of neat and
4707740	4711740	then I just realized not all our chatters know what a BBS is God I feel
4711740	4715940	old I'm really fucking sorry for not explaining it but BBS's ok back before
4715940	4719220	there was the internet or if you want to get technical the internet existed them
4719220	4722980	but it was only for fucking government people and stuff so back when like I was
4722980	4726380	in fucking high school and probably about the time with the board system
4726380	4730580	is you would have to dial in with a modem some guy would fucking hosted on
4730580	4734580	their computer or gal and you would dial in on your modem and connect to it and
4734580	4737380	then it was kind of like it had forums and a lot of the stuff that you kind of
4737380	4742980	see in a new forum on the internet today but you know is a very community type of
4742980	4745700	thing you didn't usually talk to people because you know people didn't want to
4745700	4748180	call long distance and run up their phone bill so it's a very local thing
4748180	4752180	usually yeah like I mean back in the day we have this free publication that was
4752180	4756860	around called California computer news I fucking remember that man BBS's in the
4756860	4761020	back BBS was seen in the back yeah you can you dial up I mean this is back in
4761020	4765500	the day was ZZT and I download ZZT and I mean this is back also in the day when
4765500	4770460	you know they had shareware which is you know kind of like you will take you 45
4770460	4774260	minutes to download the fucking Wolfenstein 3d like a demo you know for
4774260	4777260	a game not really even a demo for game but it'd be like the first episode for a
4777260	4781220	game would be like about five bucks or whatever you would go you know buy a
4781220	4784980	floppy disk from you know whatever retailer and you would have the first
4784980	4788420	it'd be a full game but it wouldn't be like the full full game you'd actually
4788420	4791940	go buy a new retail game but give you a really good idea what the game is like
4791940	4797020	and you could go on these servers and sometimes they would host the full
4797020	4800420	version of the game and you could download it for free or like you know I
4800420	4805540	would download you know back before mp3s you know mod files and stuff like that
4805540	4812460	you know different electronica you synthesize Amiga music files and stuff
4812460	4816740	like that so they would have you all sorts of stuff and I remember actually
4816740	4821940	the first time that there was mp3s I was like holy shit was an mp3 so that's kind
4821940	4825020	of cool but yeah back in the day you used to go in there and you could
4825020	4829020	sometimes it also have it where you could host like you know multiplayer
4829020	4834460	doom games online stuff like that I remember that into online this was you
4834460	4840580	know back in the day with you this was all that we had it was not the internet
4840580	4844300	it was like which bbs can you get into and you know what cool files that they
4844300	4848540	have on there and you know I had to download them in the Y protocol or the
4848540	4853300	Z protocol X protocol yeah most people don't know the hell I'm talking about
4853300	4858260	as ways you download stuff it wasn't as easy as click a file and it downloads
4858260	4863180	speaking of mod files because I apparently perked some years up in chat
4863180	4867260	there was an epic fucking gauntlet theme mod that was out there on the internet
4867260	4870380	was like one of my favorite mod files ever it was the music files I don't know
4870380	4874980	what mod stand for music something something but I believe it was want to
4874980	4879020	see what mode tracks it was Commodore based but you know the PC had a lot of
4879020	4882980	support for it too they had like s3m which is like scream tracker there
4882980	4887860	basically it's it's tracker things like it was like MIDI where the MIDI you
4887860	4893500	trigger your different instruments that are hard coded into your graphics you're
4893500	4899100	not graphics or your sound card well mods what they were is it was basically
4899100	4902740	different sample files like WAV files that you put in there and it was
4902740	4906300	triggered like MIDI was so you would have like new people could record their
4906300	4909980	voice record like actual guitars and stuff like that and it would be
4909980	4913620	triggered and you could create new electrical music or electronic music
4913620	4918340	with that alright anything else you want to say about portal before we go to the
4918340	4922060	next anyways yeah so they get back in the portal yeah there's some pretty cool
4922060	4928860	stuff coming out they also added an extended ending to portal which kind of
4928860	4934260	made it creepy you may remember if you finish the game a lot of people have you
4934260	4939780	end up kind of at outside while you know the whole lab kind of falls out of the
4939780	4944980	sky because it exploded well this extra ending that they've added 15 seconds
4944980	4952100	it's all thank you for you know you know thank you for going into like was at the
4952100	4961060	escort posture whatever escort position yeah the further your party yes well yes
4961060	4964900	escort party position or something like that and you you're getting like dragged
4964900	4970300	away by your head it's kind of crazy very creepy but like all hinting towards
4970300	4973460	portal to which they already did announce that there's gonna be a portal
4973460	4978100	to I believe and if they haven't well well there's big fucking done of course
4978100	4982860	portal to me it was the best fucking game that came out that year you know
4982860	4987400	yes of course is gonna be one and of course it was already confirmed by Game
4987400	4992660	Informer their cover is actually portal to and it shows kind of looks like
4992660	4996620	after science was just like all these vines and stuff growing from the outside
4996620	4999860	you kind of in through portals and stuff like that what's going to be kind of
4999860	5004100	unique about it the game will be coming out on a PlayStation or not PlayStation
5004100	5013140	PC Xbox 360 and Mac platforms and it will be two-player co-op and it's gonna
5013140	5016740	have it's gonna be a lot of fun interesting looking things in there so
5016740	5021100	nice right if you want to learn more about that of course check out the
5021100	5025380	latest game for one other first-person shooter news if you still can't fucking
5025380	5029540	tear yourself away from Halo 2 you know how much time left it's still coming
5029540	5034540	April 15th sorry guys your attempts to try and fucking change their mind
5034540	5038380	haven't worked because they are shutting it down April 15th but Microsoft is
5038380	5041620	being really fucking nice and extending an olive branch to those of you clinging
5041620	5045420	to Halo 2 if you are still clinging to Halo 2 you might want to check your
5045420	5051940	inbox because Microsoft might have offered you a beta test for Halo reach
5051940	5058020	three months of Xbox Live Gold and 400 Microsoft points now if you think oh
5058020	5061820	shit I should run online and play Halo 2 real quick sorry you're probably not
5061820	5065220	going to get it now they probably did it for people that had played you know X
5065220	5069700	number of hours in the past month but still kind of pretty fucking cool
5069700	5072940	Microsoft to do I suppose it's better than what they're required to do which
5072940	5076860	is nothing so I'm sure there's a lot of people that are going to be fucking
5076860	5081260	happy that they can get some bonuses there if they're not too fucking pissed
5081260	5087180	off about Halo 2 going away so there you go what would be really fucking nice of
5087180	5090500	Microsoft to do would be to just say you know if you want to run your own private
5090500	5094220	servers here you go but I guess you can't really do that on the Xbox 360 and
5094220	5099220	Halo 2 is not going away on the PC something to remember so if you really
5099220	5103220	want to cling cling to your halo 2 for dear life remember you can't always play
5103220	5108420	on the PC speaking of clinging to things for dear life dark Sakura every week
5108420	5111380	likes to jump into the fucking vault and pull out some really fucking old and
5111380	5115900	moldy game that she says you know what you should be playing this game this
5115900	5122200	week so it's the classic fucking game of the week dark Sakura what game did you
5122200	5127620	pick this week for the kids I picked fucking Contra I haven't done it yet
5127620	5135820	figured why the fuck not in Europe it was called Gris or and it was put up by
5135820	5140300	Konami it was originally on the arcade and came out for the NES which for the
5140300	5146380	PAL region came out as probotector excuse me I burped on the mic um and it
5146380	5150340	also came out for the MSX 2 and they're a bunch of sequels because I mean who
5150340	5156140	doesn't remember Super C right um so basically you were these guys called
5156140	5161820	Bill and Lance who work for a red falcon and are trying to stop an alien invasion
5161820	5165500	and Bill and Lance like to run around with those shirts on and carrying big
5165500	5172020	guns they wear vests Rob that's not the game and and head and we're headbands
5172020	5180380	they do I can't help it if it's not about fucking um so yeah you can get a
5180380	5184580	bunch of different um guns you get a machine gun laser gun a fire gun a
5184580	5191380	spread gun rapid firepower up all kinds of different fun stuff and then you also
5191380	5197060	besides having the typical side scrolling levels you also have a behind
5197060	5202500	the back sort of 3d maze level where you have to go in a certain order and shoot
5202500	5207540	go through the bases defenses and get to the end and it's really fucking hard I
5207540	5211700	mean seriously it's hard if you don't use the Konami code and have somebody
5211700	5217700	else playing with you and you can beat this game without dying I I want to meet
5217700	5222500	you and have you like sign my arm or something why why are in chat is trying
5222500	5227620	to show off his big fucking skills sand cleared both Contra and Super C on NES
5227620	5231260	without 10 or 30 lives and without continues who else yeah but did you die
5231260	5236220	I want to meet the person who can do it without dying can't Dan do it without
5236220	5240660	dying mmm no actually on it fucking thought he could I thought that's why
5240660	5244700	you fucking married him no it was our type that he could beat without ah got
5244700	5250940	you but also came out on this ZX spectrum Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC by
5250940	5255540	the way I need to ask you about Commodore 64 stuff Rob I fucking love
5255540	5259620	the Commodore 64 you have a good emulator ah I haven't used one in a long
5259620	5263900	time I'm hoping the game room is gonna bring back some of the C64 stuff it's
5263900	5269900	because we've done a pretty shitty job it's for someone else okay um but yeah
5269900	5275660	they all came those versions all came out in Europe in 1988 the piece the IBM
5275660	5281620	PC version was also out in Germany the Commodore 64 and IBM versions later came
5281620	5289700	out in North America as Contra but yeah the the NES version was evil and hard
5289700	5296100	and it was one of the earliest games to use the Konami code which one of the
5296100	5301980	other games that did it was you know before that was of course Gradius and
5301980	5312020	for the Falmicon it used a multi memory controller that Konami made for of
5312020	5315460	course the Japanese market that gave it additional graphical effects so I don't
5315460	5318380	know if anyone's ever played ROM of this but if you play the Japanese ROM the
5318380	5322820	um there's animation in the background and other stuff going on the leaves are
5322820	5329260	moving and the grass is blowing in the wind and all kinds of fun stuff and it
5329260	5334660	also had extra cheat codes like a stage select and a sound test and hidden post
5334660	5338340	credits scene that you would hold select and start before and during the entire
5338340	5343420	end credits and yeah like I said the European version was called Pro
5343420	5348260	Protector and the main guys were turned into robots and it was just because of
5348260	5354900	censorship laws in the day fuck censorship but when Contra legacy of war
5354900	5361760	and shattered soldier came out they retained the Contra name msx2 was
5361760	5365460	actually fairly different than the arcade and the NES version because of
5365460	5370660	limitations in the hardware it didn't scroll but it used flip screens sort of
5370660	5375140	the way that Metal Gear and Vampire Killer did and it was only single-player
5375140	5382900	however it did have it did change the last ten stages of the game and the
5382900	5388100	msx2 version of Contra is on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan came out on
5388100	5393020	February 2nd of this year of course there was a ps2 re-release version for
5393020	5397820	Xbox Live arcade digital eclipse handled the conversion there's Konami classics
5397820	5405540	series arcade hits for the DS blah blah blah blah blah and you can actually get
5405540	5408820	the Konami's collector series Castlevania and Contra for Windows in
5408820	5414540	North America which also includes Super C and three Castlevania games and if you
5414540	5421780	get Contra IV Contra and Super C on is also included as the DS so yeah pretty
5421780	5427540	pretty freaking hard and of course there were a ton of Contra games came after
5427540	5434900	there was a Super Contra well Super C well it was Super Contra overseas it was
5434900	5441420	Super C here operation C for the Gameboy Contra 3 the Alien Wars for Super NES
5441420	5446060	Contra Force furnace Contra hardcore which that's really actually kind of
5446060	5453900	hard to on Genesis Konami I love the Super Nintendo one that was awesome
5453900	5458980	Konami contracted out for PlayStation Contra Legacy of War which also came out
5458980	5466620	on the Saturn see the Contra adventure in 1998 2000 we had a Contra Shattered
5466620	5471820	Soldier and Neo Contra Contra IV came out on the Nintendo DS and Contra
5471820	5477820	Rebirth by M2 came out for WiiWare our old fucking pal like Kiryamoka did the
5477820	5481900	music for Shattered Soldier Soldier if I remember right yes he did and also if
5481900	5484300	you were looking for any of the soundtracks from the arcade version of
5484300	5489220	Contra the soundtrack is included on Konami game music volume for Ajax which
5489220	5494700	came out in 1988 there's actually a vinyl version of that Rob that's fucking
5494700	5502180	old yeah so yeah Contra all right like yeah great choice and the chat rooms
5502180	5506860	very fucking pleased with that Contra is your classic game of the week also I
5506860	5512380	totally recommend watching the angry Nintendo nerd or angry gamer nerd his
5512380	5517140	review of Contra it's freaking hilarious all right we're gonna take a quick
5517140	5521100	fucking break we'll be back with more of orange lounge radio in just a little bit
5521100	5536580	so fucking don't go anywhere we'll be right back
5536580	5541020	perhaps one of the most interesting words in the English language today is
5541020	5547180	the word fuck out of all of the English words that begin with a letter F fuck is
5547180	5553620	the only word that is referred to as the f-word it's the one magical word just by
5553620	5560340	its sound can describe pain pleasure hate and love fuck as most words in the
5560340	5565060	English language is derived from German the word frickin which means to strike
5565060	5570940	in English fuck falls into many grammatical categories as a transitive
5570940	5578380	verb for instance John fucked Shirley as an intransitive verb surely fucks its
5578380	5582740	meanings not always sexual it can be used as an adjective such as John's
5582740	5589980	doing all the fucking work as part of an adverb surely talks to fucking much as
5589980	5597260	an adverb enhancing an adjective surely is fucking beautiful as a noun I don't
5597260	5603260	give a fuck that's part of a word abso fucking lutely or in fucking credible
5603260	5609900	and as almost every word in a sentence fuck the fucking fuckers as you must
5609900	5614340	realize there aren't too many words with the versatility of fuck as in these
5614340	5620300	examples describing situations such as fraud I got fucked at the used car lot
5620300	5628780	dismay off fuck it trouble I guess I'm really fucked now aggression don't fuck
5628780	5634060	with me buddy difficulty I don't understand this fucking question

5647420	5652180	outside and play hide and go fuck yourself I'm sure you can think of many
5652180	5657100	more examples with all of these multi-purpose applications how can
5657100	5663540	anyone be offended when you use the word we say use this unique flexible word
5663540	5668060	more often than your daily speech it will identify the quality of your
5668060	5679780	character immediately say it loudly and proudly fuck you welcome back to orange

5830540	5835980	sequels including scribble knots to that's right coming from the fucking
5835980	5840700	source for Nintendo news Nintendo fucking power there will be another
5840700	5843980	scribble that's game and how can they fucking put another one you may ask
5843980	5846980	because there are so many words that were in there before because the first
5846980	5851660	fucking game sold like fucking hotcakes and it was a huge DS game well here's
5851660	5855980	how they're gonna fucking do it they're gonna add 10,000 more words that's right
5855980	5864140	10,000 words that's fucking more than 9,000 that's over 9,000 words just
5864140	5868540	giving me they were missing fucking 9,000 words apparently gonna be all
5868540	5873720	internet me me's this time I don't know but apparently adjectives will play a
5873720	5878660	big role this time like you guys summon super Einstein or electric werewolf
5878660	5886780	mmm surprising versus electric werewolf I like that baby Cthulhu baby Cthulhu
5886780	5892100	fuck yeah the shit out of me anyways it'll deliver apparently a hundred over
5892100	5900220	9,000 yes over 9,000 deliver 120 new levels a level editor a new hint system
5900220	5905220	and improved controls well better have improved controls because those
5905220	5913180	controls so how about actual controls first another not too surprising sequel
5913180	5917220	in fact I've known about this for a little bit so calm for being announced
5917220	5922980	for PlayStation 3 by zipper the company developed it the last time around for so
5922980	5926780	calm confrontation but this is an actual sequel this time and apparently it's
5926780	5934300	going to deliver 14 missions with about 12 hours of gameplay and of course you
5934300	5938500	know the developer has a pretty good track record when it comes to
5938500	5943420	multiplayer games seen as they were behind mag which had 256 players however
5943420	5951940	the game will only have 32 player online multiplayer and then this is great
5951940	5959620	apparently at the 11th hour Ubisoft has made some emergency changes to their DRM
5959620	5965140	on their PC titles apparently great topic for the fuck show apparently there
5965140	5972300	was there was some fixes that needed to be make because people were figuring out
5972300	5979780	how to crack it and of course they've already cracked it but Ubisoft says that
5979780	5984820	players should live should players lose their internet connection a requirement
5984820	5989540	under the company's ridiculous new DRM scheme their single-player offline game
5989540	5994700	would drop upon reloading you be left with your last checkpoint and not the
5994700	6000900	actual point you were cut out now their claim is that no the you know the DRM
6000900	6006420	has not been broken in fact those who are playing the cracked version out
6006420	6010380	there aren't getting the full game experience and the words are not gain
6010380	6017500	access to the you play stuff which no one gives a shit and to kind of go along
6017500	6022740	with this in kind of the worst-case scenario situation well the worst-case
6022740	6027260	scenario situation happened and apparently their servers went offline
6027260	6032380	their Ubisoft DRM often to kid authentication servers they've been down
6032380	6038220	and guess what apparently people that had Assassin's Creed 2 can't play it
6038220	6044780	right now dole and I smell a fucking class-action lawsuit and apparently yes
6044780	6049140	and it's been down for quite a long time and you know there's been people trying
6049140	6053220	to log in for like 25 minutes and there are any able to do anything and a new
6053220	6057940	be soft representative apparently responded to the forum thread that's
6057940	6062740	over on their official Assassin's Creed 2 forum and saying clearly the extended
6062740	6067260	downtime and lengthy login issues are unacceptable particularly as I've been
6067260	6072580	told these servers are constantly monitored well they apparently watch
6072580	6078420	them go down yeah fuck that up didn't you I'm honoring them crushing and then
6078420	6084100	they added I'll do whatever what I can to get more information on this issue
6084100	6089220	and here's the fruit or more on what the issue is first thing tomorrow and push
6089220	6094620	for a resolution is sure it's this will happen again in the future it doesn't
6094620	6099500	matter they've already cracked it forget about it because what apparently
6099500	6103980	happened is there is a cracker group out there that figured out that hey guess
6103980	6109180	what they have some sort of fail-safe and then in the case that will be soft
6109180	6113740	size to go out of business that will put out a patch that will apparently disable
6113740	6118220	this DRM so that you can play your game just fine well guess what the codes in
6118220	6128460	there and they've activated it so thanks to be soft you made it easy we all knew
6128460	6133340	this is gonna fucking happen and we all knew it's a stupid idea and guess what
6133340	6138700	it's a stupid idea is it a fucking stupid idea it's a fucking stupid idea
6138700	6142140	it's the worst idea ever because all you're doing is punching the people that
6142140	6145860	legitimately paid for the program the people that want to hack it they're
6145860	6149380	gonna wait for a hack version to come out I don't think there's a PC title
6149380	6153140	out there that they haven't figured out a way around some sort of DRM for it so
6153140	6160180	oh well you know you tried you failed maybe you shouldn't try because it cost
6160180	6161180	money to try
6161180	6165100	alright so a lot of fucking confusion going on over a highly fucking
6165100	6168340	controversial game six days and fallujah you might remember this game was
6168340	6171500	supposed to fucking come out and it doesn't like one fucking Konami actually
6171500	6174460	put it out because I was putting out and they're like now we don't have fucking
6174460	6177180	be associated with this because they're working with terrorists or something
6177180	6179940	they're also working with the soldiers that were there and that wasn't gonna
6179940	6185700	fucking stop atomic games and apparently IGN reported this week that six days and
6185700	6190780	fallujah is finished it's fucking done it is ready to come out but there's no
6190780	6193980	fucking release date announced just that the game is sitting there finished now
6193980	6197860	atomic games actually fucking followed up to this saying that well IGN yeah
6197860	6202500	they talked to somebody at atomic games and the game is finished and it's coming
6202500	6206060	out but yeah we have another fucking game we're doing first and then six days
6206060	6208740	and fallujah will come out it's finished but that doesn't mean we're not gonna
6208740	6211940	fucking upgrade it new fucking features a new fucking technology and whatever the
6211940	6216060	fuck we feel like doing basically in a nutshell so I keep an eye on atomic games
6216060	6218500	I suppose if you really want more information on this game although I
6218500	6223680	don't know the you know how you know that old saying strike when the iron is
6223680	6232060	hot yeah well it's like you know the iron is frozen yeah put away anyhow on
6232060	6234980	some other fucking news if you still one of these people that don't have a
6234980	6238740	fucking Wii for some reason Walmart can sell you the bundle that everybody
6238740	6243660	fucking thought would be out already Walmart is selling we owe we in Nintendo
6243660	6249180	we Wii Sports Wii Sports Resort and the motion plus attachment it's available
6249180	6254900	right now one hundred and ninety nine dollars is the price for this so
6254900	6259340	basically it's a normal we thing with Wii Sports Resort with it which you
6259340	6262740	know although Walmart I don't know they can kind of be fucking shady about some
6262740	6268020	things like I don't know censorship on albums a good deal is still still a good
6268020	6271260	deal and if you do not have a Nintendo Wii for whatever reason you want to be
6271260	6276500	limited supplies as if the supplies aren't limited enough already yeah so and
6276500	6279100	one of the fucking thing I have for you guys before I turn it over to dark
6279100	6285540	Sakura Tecmo Bowl there is a new Tecmo Bowl coming it's a new old Tecmo Bowl
6285540	6289780	it's a fucking throwback I am actually fucking excited about this I don't talk
6289780	6292340	a lot about sports games on this show because I don't fucking play a lot of
6292340	6295100	them cuz I know it's gonna sound weird but a lot of them are too fucking
6295100	6299180	complicated for me cuz I don't watch a lot of them on TV but I like the kind of
6299180	6303460	overly simplified ones like NBA Jam I always love that game in the fucking
6303460	6307700	arcades and this new one is somewhat interesting I fucking love Tecmo Bowl on
6307700	6310500	the NES I thought it was great so the idea that they're kind of doing this
6310500	6314780	throwback I find very fucking exciting this will it feature real sugar this
6314780	6318980	time I don't know the idea of this was kind of leaked a little while ago thanks
6318980	6322860	to an ESRB rating but now it's been acknowledged Tecmo Bowl throwback is
6322860	6326020	coming out on the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network sometime in the
6326020	6331860	spring it's a remake of Tecmo Super Bowl you can switch to classic 2d amongst I
6331860	6336700	guess the 3d the people who fucking made it are south and interactive they also
6336700	6341300	made that fucking loadrunner game and our type the loadrunner ever fucking

6346160	6349340	if that's the R type that's on Xbox Live I think it's probably the r-10 fucking
6349340	6355060	rad so this is a good studio to be doing this all new 3d graphics and and and
6355060	6360940	online play fuck yeah Tecmo Bowl throwback will have 32 teams online

6368360	6372460	teams the fake teams like just they're called New York and Denver but it's not
6372460	6377380	like fucking the New York of the Denver still I'm all over I bet you never
6377380	6381020	thought you would hear me say this about a sports game here on OLR I am all
6381020	6385940	fucking about this game I am I'm very excited to fucking play this game dark
6385940	6389820	soccer has got a few stories for us and then some Twitter topics I sure fucking
6389820	6397620	do rock band we are getting some songs white stripes pack which will be for 40
6397620	6403500	points $5.50 fell in love with the girls seven nation army and you don't know
6403500	6407700	what love is you just do as you're told individual tracks the future has decent
6407700	6414460	days and nights hounds of love this wasn't that a Kate Bush song anyway the
6414460	6418900	James gang walk away Neil pert the hockey theme and Seamus all of this and
6418900	6429260	tie you down and other news there is a K something that was given to me as an
6429260	6434100	incomplete link that I have no idea what it is um DJ max technica 2 has a teaser
6434100	6441460	out so I guess people can go watch it and then the 8-bit left for dead dude is
6441460	6447920	doing Megaman 9 HD remix so keep your eyes open for that although I bet
6447920	6451220	nobody's gonna ever fucking play it cuz there'll be a lawsuit that'll stop it if
6451220	6454060	they ever try to put that out cuz that's just the fucking way the world works
6454060	6457700	I'll try course it's not Activision it's a Capcom who knows maybe they'll be a
6457700	6461860	little cooler but I don't know I kind of think you know okay fucking Megaman 10
6461860	6465500	came out on the fucking weed this week right and I'm fucking waiting for PSN or
6465500	6469220	Xbox 360 before I spend my fucking hard-earned money on this game but I'm
6469220	6473620	kind of hearing a lot of the early fucking feedback is that it's kind of
6473620	6476960	just Megaman 9 all over again and I'm kind of fucking thinking well wasn't
6476960	6480620	Megaman 9 just the first fucking eight games all over again I mean that's what
6480620	6485000	the charm was about it has the fucking retro ness of Megaman worn off is is
6485000	6489980	retro really fucking old now I don't know what do you think Loki is is is
6489980	6494780	Megaman 10 too much or what I don't think it's too much I think you know
6494780	6501660	it'd be pretty cool to see them release more of these retro games promise they're
6501660	6506780	just not as good as Megaman 2 but I don't know I'm kind of glad that they're doing
6506780	6511100	that because it really it comes down to those games prove that it's all about
6511100	6515580	gameplay it's not necessarily graphics and you don't have to have really shiny
6515580	6521220	HD 3d you know modeled graphics for a Megaman game or even a lot of games it
6521220	6525580	can be just fine with just you know 8-bit retro stuff and that hell I'd
6525580	6529100	like to see a studio that only did that that'd be pretty awesome I think Dark
6529100	6532060	Touch Studio raises a fucking good point in chat saying well I don't think
6532060	6534660	Capcom would want people playing the equivalent of one of their recent
6534660	6538440	releases for free yeah I can see that they're still probably making some
6538440	6543060	fucking money off Megaman 9 and so yeah they would shut this shit down if it was
6543060	6546540	getting out there too much but I don't think it's a bad thing you know why not
6546540	6550420	you know now that they kind of did the fucking retro 3d just go in and make
6550420	6554700	some HD sprites keep the same game keep the same just just or even pretty or
6554700	6558980	even pretty you know what you could do and here's what they really need to do
6558980	6563140	you need to put fucking Megaman 9 and Megaman 10 like on the DS or something
6563140	6566500	like that so I can take it with me and play that shit you know I mean those
6566500	6571700	ROMs got to be pretty small anyways that aside or new Megaman collection would be
6571700	6576160	kind of cool with those in there fuck let's make them if they want to make a
6576160	6580120	3d game make them another fucking Megaman Legends that would be fucking
6580120	6585100	awesome alright let's get to some Twitter topics
6585100	6590440	suit you fucking people on Twitter have to say every week we read your tweets
6590440	6595660	show us your tweets at OLR lots of fucking celebration that finally a year
6595660	6598660	and a half after I think the idea was first announced we are finally having
6598660	6602920	our fucking fuck show up against the Oscars tonight in a moment of protest
6602920	6606580	not everybody fucking on board with the fuck show though sturlock sends us a
6606580	6611740	tweet to be perfectly honest this joke is already painfully old it's not gonna
6611740	6618020	be for everybody keep in mind we're not just doing it to say fuck a lot which
6618020	6622100	although I will say that's a nice benefit but it is a protest against
6622100	6626180	people taking their time to time out of their busy schedules they should be
6626180	6630220	balancing budgets to tell us that we shouldn't swear that swearing makes us
6630220	6635220	somehow unintelligent it's the same fucking show tonight just more fuck but
6635220	6638420	I don't know I was a little worried coming into it it might get fucking old
6638420	6642220	after three hours but we'll see two hours and I still feel pretty fucking
6642220	6652300	good you guys doing okay all right let's see spazzinator says some very nasty
6652300	6655940	words to Sony I got I bet yeah I bet he'll call in later and say some more
6655940	6659780	about that but also says let's see if I got this right this is in response to
6659780	6663620	the heavy rain thing spazzinator PSN says let's see if I got this right heads
6663620	6668860	blown off fine hot crowbar up the ass fine mass murder fine tits or badge what
6668860	6677460	sicko wants to see that fucking shit dude it's like the biggest like I don't
6677460	6681940	even know what word you would say to describe this just it's it's just this
6681940	6689580	big glaring hypocrisy in in the media and in society that has been going on
6689580	6695500	for a very long time it's not just fucking video games but it's movies too
6695500	6699340	what's that movie there was some movie about like it's called this movie is
6699340	6703300	rated R or something like that it explores like the NC 17 rating fucking
6703300	6707860	fascinating dark touch to you once everyone to fucking know that I love
6707860	6711660	this song resumes this week on the site that's good I like seeing some more
6711660	6715980	fucking content on olr hopefully there's more than just the I love that song
6715980	6720060	segment which was you know everything that was on the website but I do I like
6720060	6723940	music gaming music is good and so I always like the I love that song segment
6723940	6728500	the diversity of stuff that they picked so fuck yeah and lastly Takeo Ray says
6728500	6732740	his tweet wants to know so does anyone have an f-bomb count for the show I
6732740	6738220	think they lost track in the first fucking like five minutes problem was
6738220	6741520	Dark Sakura sat there went fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck and that's faster
6741520	6745720	than anyone could probably tally so that's more of something that you'll
6745720	6749580	figure out later on once they the podcast comes fucking out hey if every
6749580	6752740	if anyone actually wants to sit there and fucking count all the words I'm
6752740	6757220	pretty fucking impressed and I mean I doubt it Guinness will pay attention to
6757220	6760700	something like this because it's just a fucking podcast but hey they'll pay
6760700	6763620	attention to like what the longest pretzel is or some shit like that I
6763620	6768280	don't fucking get them both of the shit that they fucking record is ridiculous
6768280	6771900	maybe we can get sure me to hey maybe we can buy the gaming podcast or another
6771900	6781340	game fight because the gaming Guinness World Records think well we haven't
6781340	6785300	started talking about the tester yet I did watch episode 2 of the tester oh was
6785300	6791340	it worth a Shermie poop yes I still feel the same about it it's you know it's not
6791340	6795980	the most terrible thing to ever reach my television but it's no RuPaul's Drag
6795980	6800380	Race which would be the best thing to ever grace my television it's it's a big
6800380	6808220	what the fuck ever it's a three out of five through Paul drag races um it
6808220	6812700	should have to lip-sync for its life I do think that is something I don't know
6812700	6815820	it's pretty obvious that they fucking film this whole show in the scope of
6815820	6819260	like three or four days like like they're doing a little challenge in the
6819260	6822700	morning kick somebody off to a challenge in the evening kick somebody off to it
6822700	6831140	was really fucking fast I'm sure whatever just as $5,000 dude I'd go on
6831140	6834420	the tech like if it's just like four days or whatever to film the show I'd
6834420	6842420	fucking go on the tester win the $5,000 and then quit fuck you I'm out of here
6842420	6848540	all right I'm not gonna be a fucking tester you'll pay shit there if they
6848540	6851340	were willing to pay I'm not gonna say what I make of my current job now but if
6851340	6854180	they're willing to match that I do it although I don't know like if they had
6854180	6860460	it I gotta be fucking honest if instead the competition was like be the new host
6860460	6865020	of PlayStation shows or something like that I would give that some serious
6865020	6868020	fucking thought because I'd be like oh I could get do something I really like for
6868020	6873420	a living that might be worth it you know money don't buy everything I think if
6873420	6877100	the contest were be the next fucking PlayStation host of fucking yeah ever
6877100	6880340	they would probably have like I just like be the spokesperson for something
6880340	6885500	and I'd you know compete in that and win and then the surprise at the end by the
6885500	6891700	way you get to be a spokesperson for Apple god damn it Bo fuck you it to call
6891700	6894940	one our chat room chat that orange laundry calm said episode four of the
6894940	6899660	tester is supposed to be larping oh god that's gonna be awesome oh well I'm only
6899660	6904900	through the second episode I just watched it in you know waste time people
6904900	6911140	who were doing the live-action avatar roleplay themselves blue and they were
6911140	6914580	legit they've got a website in a group in everything I have fucking heard about
6914580	6920300	these people that that are depressed after they watch fucking avatar because
6920300	6924540	they they want to fucking live on Pandora like it's fucking real okay I
6924540	6928740	larped but I put vampire and you know what we didn't go running out in the
6928740	6934460	woods acting stupid we just ran around downtown mobile acting stupid all right
6934460	6937820	let's move on with some more fucking gaming news then the mailbag then your
6937820	6941060	fucking calls which I'm sure are gonna be a hoot and a holler tonight can't
6941060	6945660	fucking wait for that remember every call counts all right we might have to
6945660	6948700	institute the time limit on calls tonight I think we're gonna do that I
6948700	6952260	think we're gonna do rapid-fire calls tonight just so everybody can have their
6952260	6955620	say because I know everybody wants to get a rapid-fire call everyone gives a
6955620	6960260	fuck rapid-fire calls tonight I'm already too long we hang up on you know
6960260	6963220	what though instead of getting three calls we could get through like seven if
6963220	6968780	we do a time limit so we're gonna do that tonight all right uh Loki some
6968780	6972420	fucking gaming news for us this also has nothing to fucking do with the
6972420	6976180	PlayStation Network going well the PlayStation are technically didn't go
6976180	6982340	down but you know PlayStation 3 is it way back in late 2008 apparently a
6982340	6987580	Pennsylvania teenager playing SOCOM US Navy SEALs got kicked out of a
6987580	6992960	tournament for using a cheat mod so he decided to take revenge by crashing the
6992960	6999080	PlayStation website for 11 days and what's funny though is Sony has decided
6999080	7006460	you know what they filed a federal grand jury investigation which led to the
7006460	7013060	perpetrator getting arrested the hacker pled guilty to four felony charges in
7013060	7019540	juvie court and apparently he got access he said he apparently got access to the
7019540	7024140	site servers and let loose a virus that brought everything down and his methods
7024140	7029160	I guess weren't described but some experts or whatever contacted by local
7029160	7033700	TV station said they were so sophisticated that someone else couldn't
7033700	7040660	pull it off hopefully by now they've already fixed that stuff apparently also
7040660	7046720	it says in exchange the team pleaded guilty the four counts and lawful use of
7046720	7050780	a computer criminal use of computer computer trespassing and distribution of
7050780	7055180	a computer virus in exchange for a process prosecutors dropping the 11
7055180	7063620	others some related to the March 2009 cyber-attack that's funny no team
7063620	7069100	funnier is he's from La Trobe which we have a road over here named La Trobe but
7069100	7072180	this is all Pittsburgh new Pennsylvania I actually know where that is in
7072180	7075220	Pennsylvania not just Pittsburgh but what they're talking about well you know
7075220	7078780	boo-fucking-hoo for this kid he got what he deserved honestly you know she
7078780	7082260	didn't hack the website kicked out you got kicked out for fucking cheating you
7082260	7087620	fucking deserved it he thought he was leaked hacks or boo-hoo I got banned for
7087620	7096660	cheating when have fun in the fucking slammer on to happier news a really
7096660	7101540	fucking cute fucking game on the PlayStation 3 little big planet who
7101540	7105580	doesn't love little big planet it's so fucking adorable lots of people do
7105580	7112140	apparently enough to make two million two million user creators pretty fun
7112140	7118140	stuff on there there's some levels that were like really difficult levels I
7118140	7121820	forget what they're called though but oh man we were busting up there like on
7121820	7127020	some of the top rated user levels just go through playing those there's some
7127020	7132140	really funny fucking levels on there and this shouldn't really come as a big
7132140	7137140	fucking surprise but Media Molecule has now been absorbed fully as a first party
7137140	7142220	company for Sony so Sony is now suck them up into their collective and Media
7142220	7146460	Molecule now has their fucking check signed by Sony so there it is
7146460	7152460	it's Dan Media Molecule is no longer an independent studio and by the way a
7152460	7156380	comment from Michael Denny the senior vice president of Sony worldwide studios
7156380	7161940	quote Media Molecule will simply continue to make great games welcoming
7161940	7165220	Media Molecule into the PlayStation family will allow us to better support
7165220	7169740	their future titles and ambitions they're really fucked now just kidding I
7169740	7175420	added that last part myself all right and Dan yelled from the living room
7175420	7179300	that's only if Activision buys them boy if Activision comes for your company
7179300	7186380	run bitch run I can't say me I can't wait for them to close Blizzard that'll
7186380	7193940	be the day dark soccer would you got for us well yeah there was a version of a
7193940	7199220	number of different Nintendo games some of them super rare that were going on
7199220	7207500	eBay there was one in particular family fun fitness stadium events it hit a bid
7207500	7215500	amount of eight hundred thousand two hundred dollars fucking eBay yeah
7215500	7220580	scammers you'd like anybody who has that much money to blow on an NES game which
7220580	7226740	is actually the highest game on there right now is bubble bath babes with the
7226740	7231300	box for two thousand nine hundred and ninety five dollars and let me say every
7231300	7236940	fucking penny I'll offer what I'll offer a one cent bid on it I don't think you
7236940	7241860	can put a one cent bid when you have to do three thousand best offer five bucks
7241860	7247020	only off topic here just thought I'd mention this because it's not fucking
7247020	7251940	allowed okay well this is going back to the fucking sir we had about during
7251940	7257380	rapid-fire about the Ubisoft DRM here's why their server went down do the
7257380	7262420	exceptional demand we're currently expert experiencing difficulties yes
7262420	7266500	that's right because their games sold and people bought them and then try to
7266500	7271660	play them and it logs in online it caused server strain and therefore it's
7271660	7276260	not work so basically if you buy their games it breaks the server why don't
7276260	7279620	they just fucking say it's a DDoS attack because that's clearly what's going on
7279620	7284700	right it's not it's just from people playing their games don't you think
7284700	7289380	that's just a blow to bullshit just know it's a face if they're just stupid
7289380	7293500	exceptional demand could be a bunch of inquiries to their server I think they're
7293500	7299020	being DDoSed which isn't okay I think that's fucked up like I don't think it's
7299020	7303740	even worse if that's the case oh dude the exceptional demand well that will be
7303740	7309260	a problem going forward okay I would you don't fucking take all these statements
7309260	7312820	at face value though because look at what Sony said earlier this week we fix
7312820	7316580	the fucking date problem no you didn't you waited it out you fucking waited it
7316580	7319860	out and then put out a press release about how fucking awesome you are to
7319860	7326420	fix the problem in exactly 24 hours come on we weren't born yesterday due to
7326420	7338060	exceptional demand you know what your your fucking DRM is about as in demand
7338060	7342820	as a fucking Yanni CD at Lollapalooza okay that's how fucking in demand your
7342820	7354980	thing is anyhow more news than the mailbag that's just funny oh sorry so this
7354980	7359020	is kind of cool rock band network finally launched in rock band network
7359020	7364500	you may remember is kind of an extension of the XNA where anybody that has a
7364500	7369340	membership to the XNA can basically download the tools that they need to
7369340	7374380	convert their music into rock band tracks and then you can go ahead and
7374380	7382140	sell them online well they launched with 105 songs which is fucking awesome try
7382140	7388780	that guitar hero seriously or DJ hero don't even get me started DJ hero to
7388780	7393940	download packs yeah I should have figured no but seriously compared this
7393940	7398020	to what they have for you know it's our hero where they have their basic service
7398020	7403020	you can create your own tracks and throw them on there for free download but this
7403020	7410100	is like way better and 105 tracks launch so far the song ranges from price ranges
7410100	7415180	are about 80 to 160 Microsoft points or a buck or two and you know just kind of
7415180	7420180	some of the artists that are on here that I thought were pretty cool flogging

7424380	7432420	song cam FDM with a drug against war and jute joint Jezebel to joy because it was

7530580	7533580	one more story for you guys and then we can get to the fucking mailbag this has
7533580	7536220	to do with an update to the code of conduct I gotta be honest although I'm
7536220	7539420	sure this probably pissed me off when I first fucking heard about it I totally
7539420	7543740	fucking forgot about it until this story came out this week that apparently Xbox
7543740	7549180	Live has now lifted the ban on using the terms lesbian gay bi transgender and
7549180	7554100	straight in your profiles so if you want to put hi I like games and I'm a big
7554100	7559540	lesbian in your profile it is okay to do that now so have a ball and I talked a
7559540	7562660	little bit about this on Bobby Black Wolf show tonight you know he's the show
7562660	7566180	before us at all games radio he's a much cleaner show than we are by the way he
7566180	7570620	is always kind enough to do a call with us and I was coming on how fucking like
7570620	7574460	you know I want to see Bobby I want to see Bobby do a fuck show man I want to
7574460	7580220	see him just go off one night sound like a Bobby unhinged although he well he
7580220	7583340	swears on his other show Friday night gaming but you know that's such a video
7583340	7587140	show that there's a lot of pause that you like if you're listening to it as a
7587140	7589540	radio show there's a lot of pauses because they're doing things on video
7589540	7593260	they're playing games and stuff it makes sense I just like to see Bobby just just
7593260	7597780	go off for an hour like I can't fucking believe this fucking I'd love it awesome
7597780	7601860	anyway I'm Bobby Shaw I was talking about this a little bit and I was just
7601860	7606140	saying like you know okay yeah I'm a I'm a gay guy and I I don't think I really
7606140	7610300	care that I can put this in my profile now especially on Xbox Live of all
7610300	7616180	places I don't want to put like I'm a gay gamer 31 from California like it's
7616180	7623140	not fucking match.com or whatever it's business why do people make that
7623140	7628100	such a big deal I mean yeah it's a part of your identity but it's not like I go
7628100	7633860	around saying hi I like everybody but I also agree that if someone wants to do
7633860	7637900	it they should have every right to I just don't I just don't understand why
7637900	7641140	you do it but okay if you want to put it on your profile you should have every
7641140	7644780	right without repercussion and people you know but you're probably gonna get
7644780	7649060	all these messages from losers going what your affairs should put in my
7649060	7655580	profile send me boob photos you know cuz it would be okay to put in your profile

7791300	7797300	this comes from Jammer Jay whoa okay um who by the way sent me a very nice
7797300	7804340	Christmas Christmas card with um a sudoku puzzle in it and um isn't it
7804340	7808380	fucking March and you're just now getting a Christmas no he I got it it
7808380	7814940	bounced back so yeah and um and um and um he sent like I think and I have
7814940	7819140	judgment card or something anyway um here was a situation posed to me and I
7819140	7822900	wanted to get all our thoughts on this since we are all about the same age
7822900	7828740	here's the scenario my coworker gave me Dave and my other co-workers would put
7828740	7831940	the money into a pot in order to win the pot I would have to stop playing all
7831940	7835860	video games for a month I told him I would not do it and then it seemed a bit
7835860	7839260	ridiculous to me Dave's reasoning was that my life would get immediately
7839260	7842420	better and that I would be a better person and go out more the ironic thing
7842420	7846340	was that we were dragged out to a country bar and shooting pool which I
7846340	7851580	did not enjoy as much but I could do I think we were all met anyways being
7851580	7856140	dragged there also like many others he seems he sees the gaming lifestyle as
7856140	7861540	negative and he does not know even really what me like many others not in
7861540	7868180	Idaho okay I do a large amount of gaming everything from Beatles rock band on
7868180	7871620	360 to World of Warcraft but I balance this out with my weekly workouts
7871620	7877060	including DDR and my other grown-up things quotes I am NOT a poop soccer okay
7877060	7881780	I believe that it is what makes us individuals to be different and that we
7881780	7886140	can have different hobbies and interests different than others to enjoy life some
7886140	7889260	of the activities that people think are normal drinking playing pool partying I
7889260	7893820	have not done but I feel empty doing them even with others I would rather not
7893820	7897580	conform and do what I enjoy by myself then to feel empty so what do you guys
7897580	7901260	think is there anything else I should say to him to back up my point by the
7901260	7905220	way in Idaho most what most consider normal is all outdoorsy stuff floating
7905220	7909020	river hiking camping BSU football hunting I'm not from Idaho I'm a
7909020	7912900	Floridian this email has been brought to you by red Robin the home of the
7912900	7917060	delicious chop house burger now I'm fucking hungry for one of those Western
7917060	7922700	chicken we went to federal records today I ate an ostrich burger yummy fucking
7922700	7928260	delicious anyway um well first of all I know a lot of Floridians I lived about
7928260	7931420	an hour from Pensacola and a lot of them were back were right very well rednecks
7931420	7936260	um so yeah all the same stuff you know what just tell them like you know flat
7936260	7945420	out say I'm an individual this is I'm not going to change myself to please you
7945420	7950860	if he's your fucking friend he should understand that there's some fucking
7950860	7954500	things whatever I mean it's hanging out going to country bars he's a friend of
7954500	7957540	some some sort if he's your fucking friend you should understand there are
7957540	7960980	things you like to do you're not hurting anyone playing a video game you're not
7960980	7965540	doing nothing but playing video games you're holding down a steady job it's
7965540	7969940	not anyone's place to tell another person how to live their life end of
7969940	7976140	story that's all I think if you know what though I think here's here's my
7976140	7981100	fucking suggestion if you're gonna do that for him he should play a video game
7981100	7985700	with you and see what it is that you enjoy so much about video games I think
7985700	7989220	if you're gonna do that and go to a country bar which props to you because I
7989220	7992260	don't know how long I could stand something like that but I would do it
7992260	7995040	for a friend if a friend really wanted me to go to a country bar for a night I
7995040	7998980	would go but I think in return you should ask he should sit down play a
7998980	8002540	video game with you and try to find a game that you think he might like I mean
8002540	8006660	you know your friend better than I do you might find that new Super Mario
8006660	8010780	Brothers Wii is a game or maybe Call of Duty modern warfare is the game up to
8010780	8016660	you my friend but if this guy's really your friend like he should just take you
8016660	8019940	as you are even if he's just a co-worker then if he's a co-worker then you get
8019940	8023500	this whole other thing involved where if he's it's to the point where he's
8023500	8027880	annoying you you have every right home stop talking to you honestly like then
8027880	8031500	again that only really works in California I yeah I mean I would hate
8031500	8036700	that you would have to go that far with it honestly just encourage him to be
8036700	8039660	more open-minded and just let him know hey there's nothing wrong with video
8039660	8045520	games dude call a modern warfare made more money than most Hollywood movies do
8045520	8049900	I mean it is an art form I don't know I don't know this guy maybe follow fancy
8049900	8056100	13 and the stories would maybe maybe plays the deer hunter I don't know which
8056100	8060460	that game is actually kind of funny um so anyway next fucking email dear olr I
8060460	8064500	finished heavy rain last Sunday I wasn't affected by the ps3 clock glitch and was
8064500	8073460	able to beat sorry beat off to and beat heavy rain with no problem at all Oh
8073460	8078620	special person to me heavy rain is comparable to a show like rescue me mad
8078620	8083820	men and burn notice but notice is pretty cool damn like to rescue me um these are
8083820	8088220	shows that would have been absolutely dull to me when I was young teenager but
8088220	8092460	really deep and compelling now that I have matured into more adult tastes do
8092460	8098860	you feel the same way they're not shows that I enjoy but I see why people like
8098860	8102540	them I mean like I said Dan loves rescue me I like Dennis Leary I mean I think
8102540	8108100	he's pretty hilarious I watched the end of nip tuck this week it went out with a
8108100	8113780	fizzle hmm it was just like there's like and we give up it was basically kind of
8113780	8118100	I was really upset because there was no new RuPaul's drag race this week but
8118100	8121100	there was a new project runway and I completely agreed with who they sent
8121100	8127420	home is that what we're talking about I think it's talking about serious dramas
8127420	8130660	dealing with the issues that people don't like to talk about I think there
8130660	8135900	are certainly some shows I didn't really watch as a kid that I could fucking
8135900	8139020	appreciate a little more now that maybe I couldn't appreciate because I was too
8139020	8142420	young to understand I'm sure there were shows like that I can't think of
8142420	8145060	anything off the top of my head but there's a few shows though that that
8145060	8148740	grow up with you if you know what I mean like watching freaking Rocky and
8148740	8153700	Bullwinkle or Beverly Hills 90210 I mean I can't watch that new one it's such
8153700	8158100	bullshit compared to the old one I did I fucking grew up with Brandon and Brenda
8158100	8164700	I mean they're my homeboys sorry I thought she was on the show now I think
8164700	8167780	she did like a guest thing but it's not the same because now she's gonna be on
8167780	8174620	the show yeah some of them are on the show there was one I watched God I
8174620	8179540	watched some weird TV when I'm at home sometimes I watched this show
8179540	8184540	overhauling it's basically one of those you know they take a car and soup it up
8184540	8196380	type shows and they did one for what's his name in I remember the guy's name on
8196380	8202980	90210 yeah he is hearing in searing why do I know that yeah they did his uh I'm
8202980	8206380	silently hitting my head in shame he was on Dancing with the Stars I think that
8206380	8210780	yeah that's where they all finish reading email yeah yeah yeah also I need
8210780	8214540	help with DJ hero I seem to be unable to perform the blue button scratch
8214540	8218400	consistently and effectively it doesn't matter which hand I use or whether the
8218400	8222020	buttons are on the left or right of the turntable controller I fail on the
8222020	8226740	consistent basis are there any tips you can give me Loki I'm surprised it's the
8226740	8230140	blue one that you're having trouble with that's the one that is on the inside of
8230140	8233660	camera well what kind of surprises me is that he has the same problem even if he
8233660	8236820	flips through the first thing I would have said is play left-handed mode it's
8236820	8240600	probably inside one I'm guessing because it's hard to get a grip on it what you
8240600	8244300	need to do is when you have your hand on the actual turntable is I normally put
8244300	8249340	my thumb I rest my thumb on the outside on the actual edge of the turntable and
8249340	8253460	use that to kind of move the turntable because if you just rely on you know the
8253460	8257140	friction of your finger on that button it's not gonna work you have to keep
8257140	8261900	your thumb held down to create that kind of like friction there or it's too loose
8261900	8265660	and you'll get all these scratches you don't really want you have to use your
8265660	8269380	thumb to I think that attraction that's where your problem comes in but maybe
8269380	8271780	like I'm afraid we're gonna get a follow-up email like I'm already doing
8271780	8275060	that well then you just need practice more you might just have to take down
8275060	8279820	honestly take down the difficulty you might be playing on two I I think maybe
8279820	8282900	you're me I don't know I'm guessing what I've been a longtime fan of Bahmani so
8282900	8285620	you're trying to take it a little more aggressive I've been doing this but I
8285620	8290540	haven't done it yet I've been meaning to take like aggressively it's an adverb
8290540	8295920	whatever I don't like adverbs oh yeah we'll fuck you back we need to take like
8295920	8301140	a metal plate or something like that and find the actual dead zones on each side
8301140	8304500	you know whatever because there's little dead zones where you can actually move
8304500	8307740	the marker and it'll finally move all the way over to the left and right and
8307740	8312060	just put a plate there so that basically it's just all Center unless you go far
8312060	8316260	right far left because I hate it where you just don't go far enough or
8316260	8320500	something like that it doesn't register so that'd be kind of cool fucking play
8320500	8324060	DJ hero in a while I really need to I'm kind of disappointed price of them at
8324060	8327340	fries they have a ton of them I'm really fucking disappointed they didn't support
8327340	8331580	it better with more DLC that's two download packs they are not trying at
8331580	8335460	all there we release a couple now we're gonna release a new game they better
8335460	8341940	throw my hair back at you three with DJ hero too well if I can finish the email

8376540	8379300	listening to last week's show and I heard Jamie state that she really did
8379300	8383060	not want to discuss the crazy things going on with game crazy I couldn't
8383060	8386340	figure out why until I found out her husband works for the company I'm a store
8386340	8389300	manager for game crazy in Colorado and I think it would be interesting to hear
8389300	8392260	the opinions and thoughts on what's going on especially coming from someone
8392260	8395980	who works in a different district and region personally I am very concerned of
8395980	8398460	what's going on and it would be interesting to chat about it on your
8398460	8403380	show please do not use my name for obvious reasons but peas do respond I
8403380	8406900	love your show look forward to downloading it every week keep it up

8468620	8471980	being from a different region if you want if you don't want to say anything
8471980	8476180	on the show you don't have to about what about the closures and how you feel and
8476180	8484580	about what might be happening being out of money sucks and stores closing sucks
8484580	8490780	and if more of you fuckers would shop there instead of going to GameStop maybe
8490780	8496700	we can stay no no it's not your guys's fault it's your guys's fault there's
8496700	8500860	really not a lot to say you know the economy's tough a lot of good people
8500860	8506860	have lost jobs a lot of good people are hanging on and Hollywood and movie
8506860	8515820	gallery really mismanaged through that on a corporate level I've dealt with
8515820	8521980	movie gallery and they're like exactly it's a company that like didn't catch on
8521980	8527140	to trends that were stupidly obvious ten years ago that they could have done to
8527140	8532180	avoid all this today and if you know if things have been done differently you
8532180	8535180	know what it could have should have yeah yeah yeah you know as far as it goes now
8535180	8541420	yeah it sucks that we're losing any competition for GameStop because
8541420	8546060	GameStop's already bigger and evil er than it needs to be and that's you guys
8546060	8551820	know that's true and that honestly enough that maybe if you know if if the
8551820	8555900	bankruptcy works out which it won't and any of the game crazies end up staying
8555900	8560340	open which they probably won't you know it would be really nice that the gamers
8560340	8565580	will still have an alternative but you know to anyone else who works for the
8565580	8569780	company hey I'm there with you it's rough I can't speak for them I'm gonna
8569780	8574220	show up every day I mean you know try to help my gamers and you know I recommend
8574220	8578420	they do the same if you have a game craze in your area and you haven't gone
8578420	8584500	there hey this is it while it's there give it a chance and you know hopefully
8584500	8589720	like it and if you don't go to hell maybe we should maybe we should do an
8589720	8595000	SOS campaign save our stores well I appreciate Dan's perspective because you
8595000	8597580	know there's some people that when it comes to the day job they'd be like I

8609260	8612640	crazy isn't necessarily independent it's important to point out they're not
8612640	8617440	Walmart and they're not GameStop so that's independent enough they're a
8617440	8620620	fucking endangered species yes that's right they're like they're like a

8714540	8718300	launch rated calm if you want to send us some fucking emails meanwhile it's time
8718300	8722060	to do the F use of the week oh yeah we're still having them tonight just
8722060	8727820	because it's a fuck show doesn't mean we've got orange boxes is 1999 1799 news
8727820	8732620	we got a big story to inspire this tonight
8739900	8743660	as if the whole fucking reason for tonight's show weren't enough reason to
8743660	8748060	be angry let me give you a little something extra here a Korean couple
8748060	8753140	this week has made the news for neglecting their infant to the point
8753140	8758860	where the infant starved because they were addicted to online games at
8758860	8762580	internet cafes now you might want to take this with a grain of salt because
8762580	8767980	it's coming from the Sun but still sadly you could see it but I trust the Sun
8767980	8772140	with all of its sunlight in nutrients here's the irony they were raising a
8772140	8777100	virtual toddler in a game called Prius online it's pretty much second life but
8777100	8780620	while they were doing this they'd leave their real one at home alone each day
8780620	8783420	with just a bottle of milk for nourishment dude it's even worse than
8783420	8787900	Clara from the guild at least like she's sitting in the same room with them one
8787900	8791220	day they came home to find the child dead and called the cops claiming that
8791220	8795780	they found them dead went to found the kid dead when they woke up
8795780	8800340	investigators found though that the child was dehydrated and decided that
8800340	8804260	the couple story was full of bullshit good for them just pathetic this is all
8804260	8812140	disgusting honestly yeah I what else can you say this is just it's it's kind of
8812140	8815980	sad you don't have to take an IQ test to reproduce like some days I really wish
8815980	8820860	you had to take an IQ test in order to successfully have an orgasm oh I'm
8820860	8829460	almost there I'm almost there okay what's 2 plus 2 die forget no baby
8829460	8833620	anyhow if that doesn't inspire some angst within you then I don't know what
8833620	8837300	else well dark soccer what's your F use of the week fuck you ever hacked my Gaia
8837300	8846620	account um yeah I had about a million and cold stolen and some of my expensive
8846620	8851900	items and yeah I play on it as sort of like a little oh I'm wasting time thing
8851900	8856500	but it's just that it's just shitty you know and I want people to give me my
8856500	8863020	money back so it's just completely horrible that's really it though I mean
8863020	8865540	that and having no time to get my stuff finished
8865540	8871140	looky I'm tired so this isn't as heartfelt as it was the beginning of the
8871140	8878340	show but fuck you to the asshole that stole my 360 and my mod chip and my $60
8878340	8884580	that was gonna pay for installing the mod chip and wasting my entire day and
8884580	8888620	making me have to drive down to Stockton because Stockton sucks and having to
8888620	8897180	drive back from Stockton angry angry yes oh I was so pissed off and not only that
8897180	8901540	waiting four hours in a car in front of an apartment complex which I assumed was
8901540	8907140	his it might not be at this point I am going to email him this week though to
8907140	8910540	give him a chance maybe there was some misunderstanding maybe his phone fucked
8910540	8915540	up and he just didn't get any of my messages at the very end or maybe not or
8915540	8918900	maybe not but hey I'm gonna give him an opportunity to ship me that console if
8918900	8922140	he doesn't then we'll fucking post his email and his phone number all over the
8922140	8927140	internet so good fucking luck yeah he has an iPhone I know that he pissed off
8927140	8931820	a radio show host be warned I don't have a lot of F use this week I actually do
8931820	8934500	have a big F you but it's not one I want to stay on the show because it's a
8934500	8941100	sensitive matter so just F you to feeling underappreciated let's leave it
8941100	8948300	at that that's it for the F use more fuck show a couple of fucking stories
8948300	8952500	for you guys Loki what do you got on deck so apparently there's some fucking
8952500	8959100	new design for the DS cartridge that's come out in a patent filing it looks
8959100	8962940	like a new DS cartridge that's a little bit longer than the normal DS cartridge
8962940	8966940	it's got I don't even know looks like almost like a button or something on the
8966940	8972900	end of the cartridge there maybe either for like some sort of rewrite thing or
8972900	8979180	possibly God knows if you ask me because it's hard to tell based just off this
8979180	8983540	little picture but people are thinking that maybe it's some sort of expansion
8983540	8988460	device that they're making for the DSI or something like that to allow you know
8988460	8993340	other peripherals that you might use on say for example the Game Boy Advance
8993340	8999140	slot like maybe new guitar hero type thing this makes me think of what is the
8999140	9003740	rumble pack they put out for Pokemon pinball you know it kinda looks like to
9003740	9007220	me almost like some sort of wireless card or something like that but the DS
9007220	9012060	you already has wireless on it it's just that button on top you almost looks like
9012060	9017980	a sinker some sort of device maybe a motion controller type thing something
9017980	9022580	like that maybe the button resets you know the orientation or some shit like
9022580	9027380	that who knows we'll find out later on it when this actually comes out whatever
9027380	9032020	the hell it is that they're you know I don't know maybe around e3 sure it's
9032020	9038420	gonna suck my fucking out why you gotta be so fucking negative we relax the Wii
9038420	9042900	Vitality sensor mine that's why I gotta be fucking negative mine or the Wii
9042900	9047260	Zapper hey let's let's make this really cool controller attachment nope now
9047260	9050460	let's not let's just add a little plastic shell instead that looks like
9050460	9057860	shit on plays like shit it is shit all right I got one more fucking story for
9057860	9061180	you guys we're gonna open up the skype line a one eight seven seven game olr
9061180	9064340	our username on skype is orange launch radio the three-minute rules in effect
9064340	9068180	tonight phone calls will be limited to three minutes so that every fucking
9068180	9072500	gamer can have a voice tonight valve games are on their way to the Macintosh
9072500	9077300	that's right I guess there were some rumors about fucking steam going to the
9077300	9080820	Macintosh cuz some fucking files that were found in the latest beta build but
9080820	9087300	valve has basically hinted very strongly that the games are coming to the Mac I
9087300	9091620	guess Doug Lombardi the VP of marketing over at valve actually kind of gave the
9091620	9097540	official confirmation but no release dates or anything like that but it's a
9097540	9102940	pretty fucking understood that Team Fortress 2 Half-Life Left 4 Dead portal
9102940	9107060	those are all big big possibilities it should be noted Team Fortress 2 is used
9107060	9111100	in some type of little campaign there that is kind of a parody of the Apple
9111100	9115940	ads so some fucking Mac users are gonna be very fucking excited especially with
9115940	9118680	a game like portal and you know all those games really valve makes some
9118680	9122140	pretty fucking awesome games those are all gonna be worth playing yeah that's
9122140	9126860	what's that they're pretty cool yep so even Loki can support that on the Mac
9126860	9130780	more games for the Mac Loki that's all you ever wanted right I didn't want
9130780	9133580	anything for the Mac and I don't care that's why they want to release more
9133580	9137260	games to the Mac because there are people that buy those pcs I don't
9137260	9143180	understand why but whatever you know make the money where they can I just
9143180	9146660	want to share while Loki was reading his last fucking story I ran out to the
9146660	9149300	fucking car by the way the Skype lines open go ahead and call one eight seven
9149300	9152300	seven game all our I ran out to the fucking car to get more of these pita
9152300	9156460	chips which you become really fucking addicted to but this is a different
9156460	9160780	brand these are from Trader Joe's and these are reduced guilt because they're
9160780	9165100	not as fatty sea salt chips and I've gotten Jamie addicted to them yay oh no

9207860	9215020	you know it just seems like fucking so you can't do anything right so but on a
9215020	9222740	positive note I did speak to Sony rep not too long ago and they gave me another
9222740	9229940	story saying that yeah once I send my system in they'll you know if they have
9229940	9234340	to send me another system they'll like reauthorize need to download all my
9234340	9240780	videos well that's what that being said I'm sorry did you start to say something
9240780	9244100	there no I was just gonna say at least they're offering that that seems like
9244100	9250260	fucking more than you got before yeah well even with that being said I still
9250260	9256780	say yeah pretty much fucking sucks you know I mean you know no one should have

9358180	9361980	offer offering to re-authenticate another system but it's just such a big
9361980	9365900	pain in the ass why can't things just work why can't electronics just work you
9365900	9370060	buy them and you fucking expect them to fucking work back we have any last
9370060	9373760	minute stories to fucking get out there oh wait I got another call hold on one
9373760	9377800	minute dark soccer I'll let you jump in right after this call you're on the
9377800	9382360	Orange Lounge Radio fuck show who's this I was like a soccer who watching the
9382360	9389700	Oscars and doing this at the same time fuck the Oscars bunch of sucking each
9389700	9393140	other's dicks with these awards we all know it's gonna win doesn't fucking
9393140	9396580	matter they bumped it up to ten movies it's a two-movie race anyway all right
9396580	9400780	what's on your mind tonight I guess the the word fuck could probably apply to
9400780	9406660	someone probably some entity deserves a case-to-point Activision ha ha yes our
9406660	9412420	bad that happened recently what's your take on the whole fucking thing huh
9412420	9417340	what's your take on the whole fucking thing um I think I knew it was it was on
9417340	9421620	its way I think I knew was gonna happen it was a matter of when I mean the
9421620	9426700	writing was on the wall when infinity Ward was you know actually nixed the
9426700	9430980	dedicated servers modern warfare 2 you knew that is something that they
9430980	9436580	probably didn't want to do but they had someone's hand probably forced them so
9436580	9444420	it's kind of in other words the way I see it is that I don't know I guess
9444420	9450260	Activision is trying to bring forth the you know the great video game crash that
9450260	9455060	almost happened but never did are you talking about the one that happened in
9455060	9460580	the 80s because that really didn't happen it just you know the way you see
9460580	9466140	it is that you had you have a company that's um that's literally saturating
9466140	9470300	the market basically trying to bleed everything you know try to get all their
9470300	9476660	franchises dry and just like minimizing minimizing the amount of the amount of
9476660	9481460	properties that I sustain them in other words if if it only comes down to Tony
9481460	9485700	Hawk Hall of Duty Guitar Hero bringing bringing their only bird and butter
9485700	9488940	that's kind of dangerous I don't know if it's gonna cause another fucking video
9488940	9494020	game crash though I mean there's so many other reasons I mean you you get to the
9494020	9499620	point where we're guitar heroes you know it's pretty much pan no matter what what
9499620	9502220	new release comes out because they already know it's gonna be the same
9502220	9506420	thing same dribble it's not gonna be worth the effort I mean the last to
9506420	9511260	prove that point and when Tony Hawk you know Tony Hawk ride pretty much bombed
9511260	9515660	for all intents and purposes it goes to show that they're they're not innovating
9515660	9519020	we're just we're just releasing the same thing and trying to nickel and dime
9519020	9524020	people no innovation more renovation I think they try to innovate it's just it
9524020	9529020	sucked it's just the fact that they're not trying anything original like EA
9529020	9532820	based EA learning they're there they learn their lesson already that's why
9532820	9537980	so you see mirrors edge dead space Mass Effect because they're actually
9537980	9544060	realizing that you can't you can't you can't milk the same same cow over and
9544060	9547940	over and expect the the same result it just came down to where they they
9547940	9551780	basically had their control system in place and it worked okay for Tony Hawk
9551780	9556060	and then skate came out and had a slightly better control system that's
9556060	9561140	where EA basically knew how to innovate they found they found a way to create a
9561140	9567140	skateboarding game that was outside of the of the status quo outside of what
9567140	9572980	what Tony Hawk is offered so you see right there when you when you feel to
9572980	9576220	innovate the only thing you have is whatever you you know whatever you're
9576220	9580300	able to market and whatever you're able to litigate all right I got to jump in
9580300	9582740	and call time on the call because we're on three minute limit tonight but thank
9582740	9589420	you Zaku as always for your perspective all right great night later we do
9589420	9593020	appreciate Zaku's perspective and a gold fucking star for Zaku I did not hear much
9593020	9597900	bam bam bamming on the keyboard and I heard little little taps but no worse
9597900	9603900	than when Jamie points the mic at her keyboard all right love you mean it all
9603900	9606820	right Jamie you had a last-minute story for us tonight speaking of which while
9606820	9610380	we wait for another call at eight seven seven game olr on our fuck show I did
9610380	9615980	and it was oh geez sounds awfully loud I didn't it was when actually that our
9615980	9620580	good friend Martin left posted today and I thought it was really neat so I'm
9620580	9631340	going to share it um there is a there was a report that is about a guy named
9631340	9638340	Roy Williams who played through ocarina of time blindfolded to write a guide on
9638340	9647340	how to play the game only by using using sound clues so that a visually impaired
9647340	9654900	player could beat the game and so him and three other guys took two years to
9654900	9663140	write this but Jordan Verner who was living in Ontario beat the game isn't
9663140	9668460	that nice yeah that's it's cool and you know I know we have some blind gamers
9668460	9673860	listen to this show that you know often kind of talk about you know using the
9673860	9676860	kind of the sound cues in the games and being able to kind of play the games
9676860	9680060	that way and I think that's cool that people kind of go out of their way to
9680060	9685340	write things with sound cues and so forth and these FAQs so that everybody
9685340	9688300	can really enjoy video games in one way or another so I think it's a great story
9688300	9692660	okay we got more calls coming in sorry we've been ignoring the lines for a
9692660	9695140	little bit but let's go to another call hi you're on the orange ons radio fuck
9695140	9699540	show who's this it's about fucking time guys well really fucking sorry what's
9699540	9704380	your fucking name my fucking name is Ron mo from the New York OL army fucker all
9704380	9707660	right three fucking minutes what's on your fucking mind tonight dude I want to
9707660	9717900	know what the fuck is up with FF 13 what do you mean the black guy is sassy okay
9717900	9726340	so we both listen this sassy was one of the the adjectives I thought of when I
9726340	9731660	was playing the game too and I'm less in I'm sorry it's just that's he just comes
9731660	9735540	out kind of sassy you know you have to admit I'm a Barrett was kind of a little
9735540	9740060	bit fucking sassy too but it was freaking hardcore that yeah that was a
9740060	9746140	badass saws is sassy in a different way like dude Rama he has a fucking chocobo
9746140	9750460	living in his fucking afro I mean come on but there is you sense that there is
9750460	9753940	like again I don't want to give story spoilers but you sense that there is a
9753940	9759660	definitely deeper story to him he's not just completely transparent comic relief
9759660	9764300	they never they never Jansen Jansen was kind of sassy and lost Odyssey well they
9764300	9768380	never explained right away at least where I'm at why he's even with them
9768380	9773700	right now yeah but flashbacks will tell you a little later yes so it's all lost
9773700	9779540	style remember so but easy he's a little bit sassy I it's better than Rama you
9779540	9783380	after he's actually I will say he is my favorite character in the game right now
9783380	9788040	because everybody else is in my opinion kind of such a stereotype of the Final
9788040	9792260	Fantasy 7 characters in a way yeah yeah like I really I like him I think he's
9792260	9796900	really interesting in the chocobo in the afro is so fucking adorable like I see
9796900	9801620	like RuPaul sassy or just no no he's not like cheeky he's not like bitch you
9801620	9805200	better work he's just the calm is he cheeky a little bit he's a little bit
9805200	9811380	cheeky cheeky he's a little bit cheeky so sorry when you say sassy I think of
9811380	9815100	your sassy pants no that's a whole different kind I know but that makes me
9815100	9820460	think though of like RuPaul I don't know why but RuPaul makes me think sassy and
9820460	9826540	Tyra he does say and I had to laugh because of the lethal rep lethal weapon
9826540	9833900	reference I'm getting too old for this he does he does that no one is gonna
9833900	9839580	ever top Sid for the attitude sit your ass down in the chair and drink your
9839580	9845100	goddamn tea but Rama yeah be happy because I think they actually have a
9845100	9851580	black guy doing his voice well I will soon find out because I don't know if
9851580	9856580	you guys realize cuz Otacon is in a few fucking months and guess who's going to
9856580	9861620	have to cosplay this guy you are yes everyone's like you have to cosplay this

9867780	9871500	beyond the color of his skin he's just a good character and he has a fucking

9962020	9965540	could the Dreamcast you think in retrospect what could the Dreamcast have
9965540	9973380	done to save itself gotten someone who is more skilled in marketing I guess
9973380	9979340	someone that could have said you know hey when it comes to porting or whatnot
9979340	9987260	you know the PlayStation 2 kind of isn't so good on this so you know our port of
9987260	9992260	this particular game is looking better or something like that you're in no way

10471660	10475340	one of those trying to win anyways whatever the only ones that were surprising to me
10475340	10479620	that I didn't win would have been the hurt locker for both sound editing and

10494420	10497180	we're on to the call hi you're on orange on this radio who's this
10497180	10502100	sex link hey how the fuck are you a lot better than I have been during the
10502100	10505340	beginning of week when I got 22 in my teeth pulled oh my gosh that's right I
10505340	10511360	heard you had the big big dental surgery well you're painful shit but you're
10511360	10514500	well you're talking now you sound pretty good so everything's better well well
10514500	10517820	I'm talking good right now because I don't have the dentures and I don't keep
10517820	10522660	them in 24-7 sighs well it's kind of hard at first I was drooling for a first
10522660	10526900	couple days looking like a fucking idiot but you know hey you know you live you
10526900	10530980	learn you do it very slowly so you know and it got me a lot of time to catch up
10530980	10534860	on a few games and such so I had a friend that had to have that done kind
10534860	10539540	of young like in the early 20s so it happens so all right well what's on your
10539540	10544060	mind you're not excellent um nothing much you know it's great to hear that
10544060	10547780	the DRM is finally cracked so this way during hurricane season I could sit down
10547780	10552060	with my laptop and play Assassin's Creed 2 and not worry about being connected
10552060	10557980	on to a fucking internet fee 24-7 so because you know it's a lot of times you
10557980	10561020	know during those down times it's good to sit there with a laptop and play a
10561020	10565860	couple games and get caught back up so you know and also the ps2 thing is I
10565860	10569580	have my ps2 fat I got the one the originals sing right across from me
10569580	10573300	still works perfectly after all these years with a bunch of my games still
10573300	10577540	going through so I mean you know how they get ps2 nothing but love for that
10577540	10581860	so I mean system that doesn't break or you know go down for two and a half days
10581860	10589500	you know when there's certain leap year issues with other consoles so you know
10589500	10594180	nice I like though that we kind of get the back-to-back calls about you know
10594180	10598980	ps2 love versus ps2 hate it's it's it's kind of cool not not hate just you know
10598980	10603580	well you know there's a shitload of games for ps2 right now I'm still going
10603580	10607380	through I mean I I came and started sitting here and tell you how many games
10607380	10610100	I got to go through for the ps2 I'm sitting right across I haven't even
10610100	10614980	touched or I went halfway through and you know and and you know and I still
10614980	10617580	have a lot of them and I'm planning on going through them before I even
10617580	10621780	consider to get a ps3 or anything like that because you know that's gonna be
10621780	10627900	more on my list so I mean you know between that my PSP and my PC games I'm
10627900	10631740	pretty much set for probably about almost a year give or take it it does
10631740	10635420	have one of the fucking largest libraries of video games just ever and
10635420	10638460	it's not stopping you know if you listen to Japanese release days there is still
10638460	10642020	fucking shit coming out for it now so it's yeah but unfortunately the American
10642020	10647380	version though is slowing down though yeah it depends the type of games you're
10647380	10653900	into they always be some fucking poker game coming out no actually like a poker
10653900	10657460	game for most a year all right I'm fucking smoking crack sorry 2008 was the
10657460	10660940	last poker game we had come out no the last few games we had come out on
10660940	10664740	PlayStation 2 or coming out they have a how to train your I can they actually
10664740	10668940	have a soccer Wars game that was coming out in PlayStation 2 getting the nice
10668940	10673940	little collector's edition treatment to that in April there's gonna be the Lord
10673940	10681900	of the Rings Aragon's quest you know Lord of the Rings for kids and yeah that's
10681900	10685100	pretty much that's it unless you're talking about maybe a few EA games but
10685100	10690220	even EA cutting them out now for sports stuff at least maybe Madden probably

10705780	10708660	listeners in tonight so thank you guys very much for the phone calls really
10708660	10712380	appreciate it if you didn't get through sorry guys I'm really fucking sorry but
10712380	10715980	you have to send us a fucking email mailbag at orange lounge radio.com I know
10715980	10719100	Loki's been fucking waiting to do some last-minute fucking stories right yeah
10719100	10724500	sure all right there's there's some interesting information apparently
10724500	10728060	Batman Arkham Asylum is getting the game of the year edition which was supposed
10728060	10731740	to be coming out over in the US and as far as I'm aware still is coming out
10731740	10735260	over in the US unless they well they've already answered they're not but
10735260	10738420	whatever anyways what's kind of neat about the game of the year edition though
10738420	10744620	if you may already have you know the version of the game you will actually be
10744620	10748980	able to play this game in stereoscopic 3d that's right it's gonna come with 3d
10748980	10755860	glasses and apparently use a technology called a tri-oviz 3d that will allow you
10755860	10760460	to view the game in 3d and doesn't rely on red and blue lenses meaning the
10760460	10765540	colors are preserved and apparently will work with HD and standard definition sets
10765540	10770340	which you know if that works now I think they should that sounds like a good idea
10770340	10775460	it sounds cheap speaking of good ideas coming from Warner Brothers okay well I'm
10775460	10781700	being sarcastic here they're in talks now to produce a space invaders movie
10781700	10787020	yes the movie industry has run out of ideas well at least they could do
10787020	10789780	whatever the fuck they wanted I mean it's like there's this big fucking plot
10789780	10795660	to space invaders aliens are invading earth shoot them Wow yes the space
10795660	10801580	invaders apparently the they're speculating that the film will be a big
10801580	10811580	bucked a big-budget action blockbuster held by some prolific director Sony has
10811580	10816580	filed us some patents for game demos apparently that will lose feature over
10816580	10823580	time which I have to say is the worst idea ever can't just fucking redownload
10823580	10828220	it well maybe you won't be able to maybe it's gonna be like those time trials you
10828220	10831140	know on the windows and stuff like that and why should I have to fucking
10831140	10836180	redownload say if I want to show a demo I play demo say for a game that you may
10836180	10839460	not be getting the lot of press or whatever and I want to show my friends
10839460	10843580	like for example wet wet I thought the demo was fucking awesome and I show my
10843580	10847660	friends and they got excited about it if I have to play the game again and the
10847660	10851340	features are removed that's gonna be pretty disappointing well it was cool
10851340	10854860	the first time I played it well what you have to do is you have to make another
10854860	10866260	PlayStation profile and have your friend sign in to play no apparently Ubisoft is
10866260	10871340	looking to take on Tony Hawk which shouldn't be too difficult at this point
10871340	10876380	and they're gonna put out Sean White skateboarding yes Sean White
10876380	10880860	apparently skateboards as well and unfortunately though in the screenshot
10880860	10886220	they have of Sean White snowboarding looks like a Geico caveman so I don't
10886220	10889300	know what's going on there because he certainly doesn't look like a Geico
10889300	10896380	caveman normally and yes so they're gonna be releasing that game apparently
10896380	10900820	and most likely on the Wii because that's where the last one came test
10900820	10906060	drive unlimited is getting a sequel coming out apparently this fall and to
10906060	10912380	playstation 3 Xbox 360 and PC and apparently the sequel will also have new
10912380	10916980	elements including day night cycles weather effects and vehicle damage and
10916980	10921460	hopefully the cops will figure out how to chase you down when you drive off the
10921460	10926340	road apparently our chatters are not big fans of my Muppet voice which I guess is
10926340	10931540	what that is let's see fucking Shahran and chat says so his next show the
10931540	10938340	Muppet show or something that would be awesome no hi okie frog here and welcome

10973760	10975760	Wow, I fucking made Loki shut the fuck up.
10975760	10980760	No, I'm just rolling my eyes, and unfortunately you can't hear that on the radio.
10981760	10983760	Alright. Um...
10984760	10986760	I don't know, you people.
10986760	10987760	Yes, you do.
10987760	10988760	I'm hiding.
10988760	10990760	You're my BFF. Alright.
10990760	10991760	I know, Rob.
10991760	10997760	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts tonight, because believe it or not, we're at the end of the fucking show.
10997760	10999760	I hope you enjoyed your fucking selves tonight.
10999760	11002760	Uh, it was a pretty fucking good time, and I'm sure we said the F word a lot.
11002760	11006760	I don't... Maybe we'll get a count after the podcast goes out. I don't fucking know. We'll see.
11006760	11008760	I didn't put a lot of fucking effort into it, unfortunately.
11008760	11011760	That's alright. At the beginning of the show, it had a lot more fucks in the end. It was a...
11011760	11013760	You get tired after a while.
11013760	11021760	You do. You do. But it's... I would say you almost have to have more intelligence to be able to incorporate the word fuck into your fucking sentences for a long period of time.
11021760	11023760	It takes some fucking creativity to do that.
11023760	11024760	So...
11024760	11029760	Alright. Um, thank you guys very fucking much for tuning in and supporting independent fucking radio.
11029760	11035760	We really fucking appreciate your support, and if you fucking like what you fucking heard, please go give us a really fucking nice review on fucking iTunes.
11035760	11037760	We really like five-star fucking reviews.
11037760	11043760	Uh, it doesn't just have to fucking be on iTunes, though. Just tell a fucking friend, you know, in real life. Project Real Life, right?
11043760	11048760	Tell some fucking friends what you heard on Orange Honch fucking radio, and, uh, tell friends to listen to shows.
11048760	11052760	But you might want to not have them fucking start with this episode.
11052760	11057760	Like, this should be, like, maybe the fourth episode you listen to. Don't have this be somebody's fucking first episode.
11057760	11061760	But just tell your fucking friends. Word of mouth. That's all we fucking got, because we're an independent fucking podcast.
11061760	11062760	Aw, yeah.
11062760	11066760	Um, that's it. Let's go around and hear everybody's fucking final thought tonight.

11068760	11071760	Uh, fuck.
11071760	11073760	Loki, your fucking final thought tonight?
11073760	11085760	Uh, we'll have to see where this thing goes with this guy ripping me off. Um, I don't know. It's, it's very annoying.
11085760	11090760	And my fucking final thought tonight is sassafras.
11090760	11095760	Good night, everybody. Have a great week. We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.
