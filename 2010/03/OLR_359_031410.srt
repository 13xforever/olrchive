Woo.

11
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,040
That sounds good.

Woo.

20
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,040
Woo.

21
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,040
Not like woo, but woo.

22
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,040
I like a Ric Flair kind of woo.

23
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,780
Alright, also joining us, say hello to Tech Master Loki, who I noticed is eating barbecued

24
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:04,780
chicken.

25
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:05,780
Yes.

26
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,780
I have to be sure that I'm not getting chicken sauce on.

27
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,780
At least he has chicken.

28
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,780
Woo.

29
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:09,780
Barbecued chicken gets a woo?

30
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,780
Sure.

31
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,780
Alright.

32
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,160
I'm almost out of root beer, and that's not good.

33
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:18,760
I got him to put no ice this time so it doesn't water down with that useless frozen water.

34
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,880
no one is eating pie and today is pie day happy pie day to all of our

35
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,640
listeners we had a donut I don't know if that counts actually I did have

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,280
something kind of pie like okay I went I like I went to Charlie's Cafe and had

37
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,720
the banana cream pie well that's a pie um waffle oh they put pie filling on the

38
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,000

because it was like full of pan of waffle waffle II pie goodness waffle and

42
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,720

57
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,760
off just as we have the past several years talking about how is your gaming

58
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,760
week and dark soccer what kind of video games you've been playing this week

59
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:18,760
Atari yeah I played Gorf and I played tempest 3000 I played tempest 2000 I

60
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:25,000
played I'll just go ahead and say it I played Space Harrier on the Atari XL

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,880
hmm a beta interesting is like a new thing or like a prototype that never

62
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,160
happened it's a new thing it's developed development right now I met the guy did

63
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:40,240
the soundtrack oh very cool cool um I played what else did I play I played

64
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:46,080
centipede on the Atari XL with a remapped trackball

65
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,840
play a little peggle play a lot of actually not really a whole lot of

66
00:03:50,840 --> 00:04:01,720
Star Trek online I did like a battle and yeah all right well we'll come back to

67
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:07,400
talk a little later about all the Atari stuff Dan actually got um Gradius the

68
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:15,360
Gradius thing for we the Gradius rebirth yeah the redone Gradius yeah and so it

69
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,560
was fun watching him cuss at the Moai heads I didn't but you know I bought

70
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,240
that but I didn't really play enough of it I got distracted with something else

71
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:33,080
using of course of course Loki how was your gaming week well not too eventful

72
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:44,360
I played Final Fantasy 13 and I'm made like six hours into it and played more

73
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:51,080
Grand Theft Auto and actually part of the week our internet was down at work

74
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:57,520
or our network in the room that we have the 360s in so we ended up playing some

75
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,880
old-school Saints Row one a death or death match multiplayer so that's fun

76
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,000
because you could do a system link on those and they don't require Xbox Live

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,720
and then I did check out the demo for just cause two it's pretty fun not as

78
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:22,600
fun as I would hoped but I think I'd like it kind of got that mercenaries to

79
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,320
vibe to it I mean it's very similar obviously to the first just cause game

80
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:34,280
but thankfully it is well very much higher production value than mercenaries

81
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:42,680
to in that game was glitched out every which way possible so I did finish

82
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,040
downloading the blur multiplayer beta haven't played it yet so that'll be

83
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,800
pretty fun they're supposed to be adding some more codes for that so hopefully

84
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,880
I'll be able to give you one

85
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,320
Rob so I got one I just I'm in the same boat you are I had so much other stuff

86
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,760
going on and I was really excited about blur too but I keep now I'll get into it

87
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,760
a minute

88
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:10,160
so yeah I think that's really all I played this week I tried going back to

89
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,280
play some more Borderlands but since I've been modding the hell out of it I

90
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,560
finally downloaded the patch that's supposed to get rid of all that stuff

91
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:25,040
and it kind of jacked up my game like now it won't load my save game correctly

92
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:30,000
and it's not a big deal because I don't really care about the progress in the

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,040
game or my level or whatever cuz I've been cheating anyways it's just that I

94
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,320
don't have to go do all those quests again because it's a lot of just running

95
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:46,000
around it's really annoying so I have to go through and get to be fixed again and

96
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,440
then I'll cheat again

97
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,560
oh by the way I am also cheating through Final Fantasy 13 because you can you

98
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,320
know edit the save games to do all sorts of crazy stuff if you can cheat it or

99
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,520
hack it or crack it Loki's probably done it

100
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,200
by the way speaking of hacking and cheating I think Dan wants to talk to

101
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,320
you about something related to a Japanese Xbox game

102
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:11,960
okay awesome anyhow if that's it for Loki's gaming week then I'll go ahead

103
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,320
my gaming week yeah like Loki said I I got into the blur beta but sadly I've

104
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,400
just been so into Final Fantasy 13 that like all of my gaming time has been

105
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,440
sucked into Final Fantasy 13 I'm about 16 hours in at this point and I get the

106
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,720
sense I am like right before something epic that's gonna happen in the story

107
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,920
like again I'm not gonna give out spoilers I am very you know touchy with

108
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:40,280
spoilers too it's like don't even joke and chat like we will kick ban you and

109
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,500
we're not at the point I think you have to be about six months out before it's

110
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,360
okay to spoil like you know but I get the feeling I'm coming up on something

111
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,520
pretty epic about to happen in the game also there's something else that a lot

112
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,160
of hints have been dropped for and again I'm being very cautious here I'm not

113
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,320
gonna spoil anything because I don't even know if I'm right but I feel like

114
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,560
there's been a lot of hints dropped over the past couple hours to something in

115
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,960
the story that I kind of didn't see coming and there's one it's one of those

116
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,280
like I haven't seen that in a Final Fantasy game before and if I'm right

117
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,400
it's kind of one of those well played Square Enix well played I think I think

118
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,280
there's something up I can't again I don't want to spoil that uh but

119
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,640
definitely the story in the game is really good like you know I think a lot

120
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,240
of people played through the first three hours and there's definitely your

121
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,440
characters that are likable and dislikable but as that the thing that

122
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,020
was mentioned last week the game is like a banana that slowly peels back to

123
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,300
reveal all of its layers or maybe like an everlasting gobstopper because it

124
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,720
takes so long to get through and there's all these different colored layers you

125
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,200
definitely start to see that there is more to the story than what you saw in

126
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,640
the first few hours I do like very and I do like the weapon upgrade system

127
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,840
because I was like wondering well those components were for big yeah I thought

128
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,720
it's gonna be more of like crafting though instead of like okay these

129
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:01,160
components equal X number of experience and your levels go up and the weapon

130
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,880
does more damage or whatever well it's interesting it takes so long in the game

131
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,880
before you get to that so yes those of you that haven't gotten that far yet

132
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,080
yes all that crap you're collecting you will use later on to upgrade your

133
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,840
weapons that's not really a spoiler that's that's just a game mechanic

134
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:20,440
that's nobody yeah so but anyway the story I just got to say I if I'm right

135
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,620
at what I kind of have a hunch is what's going on I'm gonna be like very

136
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,860
interesting and in six months when the moratorium on spoilers is up and it's

137
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:31,000
okay to spoil I want to get into it cuz it's it's I'm just wondering if we kill

138
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,260
the cyber Pope because you know he looks like he has it coming my favorite

139
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,160
character though I think is still saws because he does have a chocobo that

140
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,160
lives in his hair and the chocobo gets a little more personality as the story

141
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:50,200
goes on and it's it's disgustingly cute disgustingly cute and I was gonna say

142
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:58,160
that the Shiva sisters they're their motorcycle is naughty I I am so happy

143
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:05,240
that Final Fantasy has gone back to this just epic over-the-top summons thing in

144
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,280
the game like that I you back to like Final Fantasy 7 where it was like Knights

145
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:14,440
of the round and all this well ten yeah ten had it too it did it did there was

146
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,920
one ten did have the Shiva that would come out and snap her fingers and then

147
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,280
the ice would shatter everywhere it's nice to see that again there was one

148
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,800
part though of the game that I didn't like so I mean it was kind of annoying

149
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,960
thankfully it was a really short section of the game but you know they kind of

150
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,480
tried to change the gameplay up a little bit when you get that little mech thing

151
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,320
that you walk around in for about five not even five minutes like two minutes

152
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,000
that was a waste of time I can see why some people are kind of in on Final

153
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,560
Fantasy 13 because it does change things up a lot and yeah you don't really go

154
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,200
out into this world map and go to towns and stuff like you do in a Final Fantasy

155
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,680
game you didn't intend either if you think about it remember it was just the

156
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,200
airship in different spots that you could kind of drop down into it was

157
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,200
exactly these games are kind of like that to Lost Odyssey I there's a lot of

158
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,920
I see in I mean besides the battle systems are completely different but

159
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,840
like the way you move around the map and everything it's very similar to Lost

160
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,680
Odyssey you know you have these relatively linear dungeons with

161
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,320
different branches and so forth you know but Lost Odyssey didn't get a lot of

162
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,360
crap but clearly Final Fantasy 13 is just have an idea what they think Final

163
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,080
Fantasy should be and if it's not that then they're like oh it sucks really

164
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,200
when you look at it it's exactly the same as all the other Final Fantasies so

165
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,120
what so you don't have to wander around aimlessly in like some overworld for a

166
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,840
while big deal tiger claw in our chat room chat that

167
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,760
orange launcher dot-com says sky he would have to wash his talking about

168
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,240
sass sky he would have to wash his hair every day though to clean out all the

169
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,840
chocobo poo I do want to point out the chocobo is capable of flying out of the

170
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,840
hair and you do see that happening so he hopefully is potty trained to know to

171
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,360
fly out of the hair and go to like a nearby tree or something I don't really

172
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,600
get into that and normally animals don't poop where they sleep you know just like

173
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,080
just like to show me you know there's just some cases where you don't have to

174
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:07,320
explain the bathroom thing like take 24 for example on the show 24 it's so fast

175
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,160
paced and action paced you don't ever stop to really think when do these

176
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,880
characters have time to poo when they're not when they're not showing them you

177
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,080
know it's just like when it goes to some other character but these are things you

178
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,680
do you don't think about because 24 is so action-packed and there's so much

179
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,520
going on you're not supposed to be thinking about gee I wonder if Jack's

180
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:32,560
gotta go anyhow is our all the scenes always focused on him what's that are

181
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,400
all the scenes always focus no they're not so then he goes he pees well he's

182
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,640
usually in situations where it's not like there's a bathroom nearby like when

183
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,400
he's robbed depends when he's tied to a chair getting tortured depends all right

184
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,800
forget it although that would be awesome to spend a whole episode based on you

185
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,280
know him trying to find a bathroom no it would not be awesome actually canceled

186
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,560
so oh well no NBC might buy it now that they have five hours available on week

187
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,280
nights that's the rumor anyway it can just replace the site show with 24 is a

188
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,240
great show although it's one of those shows where it's like I missed an

189
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,560
episode so now I can't watch like any of it because you miss one you miss

190
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,080
everything it's like lost like people just obsessed with lost and I get why

191
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:18,800
there's a lot to it but but I again if you missed that first episode I think

192
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:25,840
you're just lost period anyhow yeah yeah just like Brad from pod culture said he

193
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:30,400
pees during the commercial break just like everybody else does liquid parrot

194
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,520
and chat room ass I'm playing Final Fantasy 13 now I'm getting five stars

195
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,920
after every battle but what's the point is there even exp in this game there is

196
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,960
not exp but there's crystal points that let you move around the board similar to

197
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:48,680
Final Fantasy tens level up system the stars I believe affect your loot you can

198
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,960
sometimes get loot affected by the stars I think more importantly your technic

199
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,080
points which I don't know if you're to the point in the game where you're using

200
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,920
those yet but they allow you to cast spells like Libra you will see how that

201
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,080
comes into play if you're not already there the star ratings affect how fast

202
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:10,280
your bar fills up for technic points so there you go anyhow other games I think

203
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,640
I mentioned Wow I'm playing Warcraft my boyfriend and I made it to Outlands on

204
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,720
the characters we've been working on for a couple months so yay that and the

205
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,680
Megaman 10 came out this week on PlayStation I didn't play it really a

206
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,920
lot I just kind of downloaded it and went in and went ooh I pretty and and

207
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,000
well not really pretty but retro tastic and and I went in and watched the

208
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,240
replays oddly enough that was the first thing I did I went in to watch replays

209
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,120
and watch people just do speed runs on these stages that are insane that's kind

210
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,200
of a cool thing I don't remember if Megaman 9 had that if it did I just

211
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,760
never looked for it but for some reason that jumped right out at me in this

212
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,840
Megaman 10 and that was one of the first things I did so I need to play that a

213
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,800
little more it's nice though that I can watch movies on how to beat stages when

214
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:56,160
I don't know what to do so that was pretty much it for my gaming week let's

215
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,640
go to some housekeeping Jamie you went to an event today where you played all

216
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,480
these Atari games give us a little wrap-up on what this was all about I

217
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,640
went to the Atari party 2010 which I guess I didn't really know about this

218
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:15,760
before but apparently they do it every year and it was basically this kind of

219
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:22,600
house like structure in Davis you had a kitchen and a big room but they just had

220
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:30,000
Atari systems looked up everywhere and I met a man named Sal who you know I said

221
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,640
I was gonna mention his thing but I put my piece of paper with everything on

222
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:42,600
there mention it next week I will definitely make a big mention of it but

223
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:51,600
it was really cool he does a lot of he did soundtracks for a lot of I guess new

224
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,960
releases of our ports of other games you know or releases of prototypes and other

225
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:02,720
ones like that right now they're working on outrun in space Harrier for a the

226
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:10,760
Atari XL and the which is a computer version of the the 5200 it's funny his

227
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,760
company's called Atlantis games if that was the name because Atlantis was one and

228
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,720
I thought I looked it up on Wikipedia real quick just to jog my memory I

229
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,520
thought Atlantis was one of those big big Atari 2600 games it was really well

230
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,640
loved and yeah there's some screenshots here was that one of those a magic game

231
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,000
so it had that very unique looking cartridge with like the orange that was

232
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,040
a great 2600 game so I don't know if the company is named and owed to that game

233
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:37,880
or what but that was one of the better 2600 games sorry so I actually um he

234
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,760
played a lot of the it's just um some songs that he had done in that format

235
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:48,360
though just for fun like axle F and Actraiser music and Mega Man and

236
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,440
different stuff is actually pretty cool isn't amazing Castlevania any synth ask

237
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,120
kind of system like you know whenever there's some type of Cynthia type sound

238
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,320
involved always has axle F and somehow Van Halen's jump usually makes an

239
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:09,600
appearance at some point to maybe he didn't do it but somebody did well at

240
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:15,480
any rate they also had this is keeping my brain kind of fried from being out so

241
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:22,080
long but they had the DVD game system you know how some of the DVDs for all

242
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:26,000
they were doing like a game system hooked up to it so they had a version of

243
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,440
tempest 3000 what I remember tempest 3000 yeah let me see if I can pull it up

244
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,760
real quick was that what are those those like little joysticks you hook up to the

245
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:44,320
television but yeah yeah I'm gonna find it interesting well okay so um tempest

246
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:51,480
3000 and by the way it is gorgeous um it uh I'm trying to find what was on it was

247
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,000
um because I obviously I remember to the new one the new one is what it is

248
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:06,800
Wow um the it was a DVD a system that had enhanced DVD tools in it and 3d

249
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:14,040
video game playability on it so uh only a few things came out on it but so far I

250
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:18,880
think just tempest 3000 is the only real notable but they had one there and had

251
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,720
it hooked up there's a link a picture of it to the chat room but that's uh it

252
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,640
looks like an n64 that's what I first Wow that's coming in so I had looked at

253
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:35,640
it and I was like oh no that's a new one yeah so um but I played tempest 3000 and

254
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,000
there was actually some video up of Dan playing tempest 3000 because I recorded

255
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,920
stuff with my iPhone Jordan on your YouTube it's on my YouTube right now so

256
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,480
it's on your YouTube channel yeah I'm gonna give that out publicly or yeah

257
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,640
it's all our dark Sakura or dark Sakura or something you know it can you find it

258
00:18:52,640 --> 00:19:01,560
Rob yeah um but uh I uh it's a lot of battery your dark Sakura or lr but yeah

259
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:07,240
I did like a couple of sweeps of the party and you know just you know I took

260
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:14,040
a few screens on here's tempest 3000 I want to kind of play this a little bit

261
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:21,320
tempest 2000 but it plays on the laser the DVD players that have you on

262
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:32,720
should I got you to put these on the olr YouTube that's all right I'm just

263
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,680
trying to get a look at the game here it's sorry I know this doesn't mean for

264
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,280
a great radio but yeah it's very blurry that's the problem with it this is an

265
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:45,400
HDTV it would be a lot better but it's why I still say I prefer tempest 2000 to

266
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:50,680
tempest 3000 because tempest 3000 gives me a headache the score is gigantic in

267
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,960
the corner that's kind of the music's the same

268
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:03,640
Wow almost makes me wanna see a new one get added to the gaming vault I can't

269
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,480
imagine if I could find one I'm sure they're pretty expensive very cool all

270
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,160
right so sorry I was not aware of tempest 3000 yes I would say it's one of

271
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,160
those things I've heard of before but I just really haven't seen emotions I've

272
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,040
covered it I've covered it when I was covered tempest yeah but it's it's one

273
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,480
of those hearing about it and seeing it or and playing it are three different

274
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,200
things there were you know there were Jaguars all over the place and you know

275
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:36,040
all varieties of Atari systems it was pretty fun it was pretty fun and I'm

276
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:43,920
actually thinking I'll find the stuff a little bit later for everybody but the

277
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:49,320
the guy I talked to has an eBay store and he sells the refurbished excels for

278
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,760
like 70 bucks which isn't bad because you know they're all you know set up to

279
00:20:54,760 --> 00:21:02,560
work with s video so and you know he sells most of cartridges that they do

280
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,960
for like 30 bucks I mean it is you know time and effort went into it is pretty

281
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,720
much a new version of the game except he did tempest extreme well they did tempest

282
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:16,000
extreme that because of how much work and everything that went into getting it

283
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,820
to run properly it's actually a 50 buck game but I've seen it in motion played

284
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:27,940
it well worth it so it was pretty good all right the Atari party a little local

285
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:33,340
event sounds like a PlayStation there and I was like hey you're at the Atari

286
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,220
party or were they playing the Atari collection maybe on the PlayStation

287
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:40,420
night that might be so no I just heard the little PlayStation chime and I was

288
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:46,880
like hey that doesn't belong here you get that or you get that out oh and um

289
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,720
they also had one of the mountain you know ran into Neil there mm-hmm and I

290
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,560
didn't get to see it he cuz I was talking to the the XL the guy had south

291
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,440
we were talking about the music and everything by the way since I don't

292
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,600
think Neil's ever been on this program he's no buddy of mine from like junior

293
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,120
high school we've known each other a very long time and so he goes some of

294
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,440
these nerd things too yeah you he also does rocky a big part of that and is a

295
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:23,080
big nerd so he also gave me that I'm act that's collecting dust under the pinball table but the crap he told me that they had

296
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:30,400
choo-choo rocket on one of on the the you know I'm gonna see what what it is

297
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,680
oh what are the Atari systems like somebody poured in it yeah no Wow I'm

298
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,040
seeing what it was I just you know completely unplugged my phone sorry on a

299
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:45,440
1040 Wow so that's pretty cool lots of retro love people still making new games

300
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,320
on old systems it's kind of funny and yes Amiga 777 it was a Jaguar someone

301
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,280
had Jaguar CD hooked up to iron soldier was one of the engineer playing so I was

302
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:02,160

00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:38,160
forum we're actually down to the final four it's late for the past versus

311
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:44,160
Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 6 versus Ocarina of Time I'm pretty sure

312
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:49,360
yes Chrono Trigger versus Lake of the past and Ocarina of Time versus Final

313
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,120
Fantasy 6 those are the final matchups we don't have that many votes but both

314
00:23:54,120 --> 00:24:00,560
matchups are incredibly close so be sure to get your votes in tonight if you're

315
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:04,960

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,400

317
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:14,440
of the madness tournament for more information once again log on to www.

318

orange lounge radio.com and click on forums talk to you guys later bye bye

319
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:23,160
very interesting matchup in the final four is it to Zelda games somehow made

320
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:28,280
it to the final four but Final Fantasy 6 is up against Ocarina of Time got to

321
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,520
tell you my vote went to Final Fantasy 6 that's that's one of my favorite Final

322
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,720
Fantasy is probably I don't know if I do I would give it the six to I and don't

323
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,720
get me wrong I realize I've said my piece on Ocarina of Time and it's still

324
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,480
a great great great game but Final Fantasy 6 is like a great great great

325
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,920
great great game the other matchup is Link to the Past versus Chrono Trigger I

326
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,880
personally voted for Link to the Past but I know of course Chrono Trigger has

327
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:56,040
this extremely loyal fan base I really wouldn't be surprised to see that win

328
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:00,120
although what you know Link to the Past if I had a Super Nintendo sitting in

329
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,080
front of me and both of those carts I'd reach for Link to the Past I would I

330
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,640
would probably play through more of that one sitting than I could Chrono Trigger

331
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,920
too but anyway it doesn't really matter what I think it's what you guys think so

332
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,800
go check that out in our forums we'll have more updates on the winner and if

333
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,520
you don't like the games that are there we'll poo on you you should have been

334
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,800
voting or sending your top 25 list like we told you to like couple months ago so

335
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,120
if you missed your chance this year don't worry you have get to do it all

336
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:30,960
again next year all right um let's see SHA100 Matt in our chat says Ocarina

337
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,200
isn't a Link to the Past that's true but Link to the Past did have an Ocarina in

338
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,480
it if I remember right didn't it wasn't it one of the early ones where you at

339
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,280
least it had like a whistle type thing like some sort of whistle that looked

340
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,080
like an Ocarina it's kind of like a really really old

341
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,380
integration of that anyhow let's get into some actual gaming news what is

342
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,280
going on new in the world obviously lots and lots happened this week we gave

343
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:57,280
developers conference but first some other big news that wasn't from GDC

344
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:02,880
right Loki yeah there's and this isn't too surprising just you know from their

345
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,760
track record of what's been released recently but apparently Majesco is kind

346
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,680
of going the way of Midway and Atari where it's now being threatened by

347
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:18,360
Nasdaq with a delisting apparently again this is not the first time that

348
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:23,520
this has happened the company now has 180 calendar days to bring its stock a

349
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,960
price above $1 per share the minimum required to remain on the exchange the

350
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:36,320
trick is though that they can't it it can't just pop up it's a fiscally or

351
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,720
fiscally hurting head above a bucket for a day and everything will be good you

352
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:47,480
know fine it has to stay above the $1 mark I guess for a minimum of 10

353
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:55,880
consecutive trading days prior to August 30th 2010 now if you think about it

354
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:01,280
Majesco hasn't released much for a while I mean you're really there big franchise

355
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:06,520
right now is cooking mama and cooking mama's what like gardening mama and I

356
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,960
mean they've kind of dug that into the ground haven't they yeah I mean it's

357
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,040
they've got a few games coming out of like there's a Pirates of plunder are

358
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,640
supposed to be coming out soon but I mean come on between Pirates of plunder

359
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,440
flips twisted world you know a bunch of these secondary titles there for the Wii

360
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:30,280
and yes I just don't I don't really see this happening I mean they don't have a

361
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:37,360
date they put out the mad dog McCree pack on Wii oh whoa well I guess I'm

362
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,800
wrong I know exactly yeah I'm looking at the list of Majesco stuff and I'm kind

363
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,560
of like oh boy oh there's I mean they have the Teen Titans license which I'm

364
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,920
sure sell some games I mean I'm not I'm not really they haven't used they

365
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:55,440
haven't put I haven't done in a while a few years they have a Texas Hold'em game

366
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:01,960
on DS but those are a dime it does those are like years old okay stray the blood

367
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,720
rain games but again those are kind of old news they haven't been doing a no

368
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:11,000
they've only really been doing like DS and Wii titles and they've been very

369
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,640
secondary I'm sorry to say I mean like like I said the last few games have come

370
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:24,240
out from them okay Data East arcade classics collection yeah that's a nice

371
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,560
collection of games but it's not gonna sell like the the copies that they need

372
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:35,440
the make money I mean it's just no triple-a title or even really a titles a

373
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,320
lot of let me a lot of seat on this way like a company in like 505 games I mean

374
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:46,120
they're like pretty brand-new I mean they're relatively new like a few years

375
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:51,080
old and they put out a lot of crap but they're putting out more games and these

376
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,600
guys are and they actually have some decent titles coming up that are pretty

377
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,480
notable like naughty bear or something like that well they may not also be

378
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,960
traded on the stock market either keep in mind that we're not talking about if

379
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,520
they get delisted from the stock market they're gonna just go under immediately

380
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,880
although that's although that's a side effect yeah but it well it's our

381
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,920
Atari's still kicking I mean not as much as they used to but they're kicking

382
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:19,480
they're kicking with the float even there you know kickboard but it's just

383
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,360
it's not what it was I mean Midway they went under and all their assets got

384
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:28,480
bought out Majesco I could see that happening I mean you know gardening mama

385
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,360
that could be something or like you know the cooking mama series that could be

386
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,400
something that probably fit with like Ubisoft even SSJ 100 Matt makes an

387
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,560
excellent point in our chat room chat that orange on city.com they should have

388
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:43,480
brought president cat over before they go under because president cat would be

389
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:49,040
a triple-a title indeed it would hold out hope for e3 at

390
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:54,080
Majesco's booth you never know you never know if president cat does show up at e3

391
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,680
I will be going over to the booth of the person who had the balls to put it out

392
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,440
saying would you like to shake my hand

393
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:08,880
I'd be all sorts of like crazy oh by the way and it you know like they did with

394
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,920
any three last year in Nintendo's press conference oh by the way here's a

395
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:20,480
Metroid other M trailer it's like oh by the way I think we have a candidate for

396
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,880
a perfect title this holiday season this election season we have the candidate

397
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:31,920
for you I would just I'd lose it I would all right yeah I'd be on the floor

398
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:37,160
shaking and crying all right now all right for real though other stuff going

399
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:43,200
on quaking in your mantis I would I would anyhow PlayStation move was

400
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,320
revealed this week a game developers conference I'm sure any of you guys that

401
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,960
actively follow the gaming blogs have heard about this it's not the arc or

402
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,640
anything like that it is the PlayStation move is the name of the controller and

403
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,800
it made its debut at GDC they are promising that it will launch for less

404
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:05,520
than $100 which means like what $99 right $99.99 $99 and then there's been a

405
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:10,840
lot of the little thing that they were doing their conference talking about so

406
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:15,680
calm for because so calm is going to be the big franchise that gets the support

407
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:20,600
of PlayStation move this year and they were cut I noticed they went out of

408
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:26,200
their way to say look how you don't go flailing about like you know they really

409
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,560
kind of tried to poke fun at the weed very subtly they said notice how he's

410
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,500
not flailing about he made these very subtle motions and I gotta say granted

411
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,960
I'm not a so calm player so I didn't really know what to look for but you

412
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,920
could see the dude sitting there and if it was a live demo which I have no

413
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:44,640
reason to doubt that it was it looked pretty yeah he's just kind of using it

414
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,640
as a another way to control the game that's just like you know the Call of

415
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:55,240
Duty games that are on the Wii I mean it's it can be done I mean you can just

416
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,000
use the the one controller as a pointer and then the other one the kind of

417
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,360
control your movements and then maybe throw in some different like motion

418
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,960
sensitive commands that you can do for different things well I know they were

419
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,080
trying to really make it a point to to say look at the precision this thing has

420
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:17,200
great precision this is a precise controller like they were really trying

421
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,760
to take a jab at the fact that the we can sometimes be a little all over the

422
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,680
place and I do agree it's probably gonna be more precise but because they've had

423
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:29,920
more time to perfect the technology exactly but I mean from what they're

424
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:34,640
showings were of what they're gonna be putting out come on you're not that much

425
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:40,360
better than Nintendo like for example iPad well okay iPad you know and now we

426
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,920
finally understand why that title is delayed forever and and that's kind of

427
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:49,120
neat it's different because it's a little bit of augmented reality stuff in

428
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:55,920
there but mainly I was saying you know move party come on oh great more party

429
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:59,360
game collections yeah it's like you know what though if that's what sells that's

430
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,880
what sells no no no and I don't have a problem with them doing that because

431
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,920
it's kind of neat to see like you know that kind of a party game with actually

432
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:11,840
good graphics in it you know what I mean and it would be neat if they actually

433
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,080
figure out unique ways to do this but do they've got an archery game in there

434
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:22,880
it's just like the fucking archery game and we sports you know resort HD oh who

435
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,960
cares well to be fair there's a Lord of the Rings game coming to for what it's

436
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:31,400
worth that's a port of a Wii game and looks like it and then they do they did

437
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,960
make sure to stress that they had so many companies behind it like they

438
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,520
showed a slide where there was just logos all over pretty much all their

439
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:43,080
big publishers are jumping on board with move somehow which isn't too big of a

440
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:47,440
surprise honestly it'll just be interesting to see if there's that must

441
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,880
have game there's that must-have game that really sells the move I don't know

442
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:56,000
if so com4 is it I mean so com4 don't get me wrong so com4 there's a lot of

443
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,680
so com fans and especially because they they've made it a point to say you don't

444
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,600
have to use move you don't want it was just you know something that's there too

445
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:07,080
exactly and I like how they do have the option there and options are good I'm

446
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,480
surprised Sony's jumping on that bandwagon because you know that wasn't

447
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,760
really something that was their mantra but so calm isn't really that title that

448
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,880
has crossed the line to get everybody interested including the soccer moms

449
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,720
which are important because it's their credit card usually with the kids you

450
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:26,800
know it'll be neat just I think the PlayStation moves like the move party

451
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:32,720
stuff will be okay especially if they're gonna bundle that with the software but

452
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:39,360
my thing is though too is you gotta buy you know at least one of these is gonna

453
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,960
come with your kit or whatever that's gonna have the camera which I don't even

454
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,800
really need this because I have the camera already okay so you have to buy

455
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,200
one of those controllers which let's assume it's the same price as you know

456
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:56,180
the Wii the Wii remotes like 40 bucks okay well those things they have two of

457
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:59,980
them they have one that's kind of like a nunchuck type of controller air sub

458
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:03,840
controller whatever that looks exactly the same I have a feeling it's gonna be

459
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:09,000
another $40 okay so great I have you an $80 set of controllers here that's for

460
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,400
one player now I need it for the other three Oh goody so there you know what

461
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,640
you've spent a good 200 you know three hundred and twenty dollars on fucking

462
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:23,720
controllers dark soccer oh what are your thoughts on move what's with the light

463
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:28,080
bulb I think isn't it like be able to see the different players and where they

464
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,560
are in the room type of thing um that and because it's something that the

465
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:35,840
camera can track oh yeah cuz it's all camera that's why they have LED thing

466
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,400
little like glowing balls on like people when they're motion capturing them and

467
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:44,640
stuff like that hmm I don't know again I'm kind of torn like I'm I look at

468
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,520
PlayStation move and I go oh okay neat I like what Sony's doing with that but

469
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,000
then I look at it and go yeah but there's nothing I there's nothing that's

470
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,340
gonna make me run out and buy this day one right now you know again I'm not

471
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:59,300
really the SOCOM fan that doesn't really speak to me I don't know these minigame

472
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,680
collections don't look anything better than the Wii except maybe the graphics

473
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,520
there's nothing that makes me go OMG got to get one of these day one here's the

474
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,260
problem is that they haven't figured out why they're not selling as well that's

475
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:12,260
really what it comes down to is they think oh my god it's because you know

476
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:16,700
this other console has motion sensitive stuff that's why it's selling well no

477
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:20,080
it's because it has casual games and games that feel the family so that's why

478
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:24,480
it's selling well I just think it's too little too late you think they're

479
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:30,000
jumping into this too late heck yeah hmm I mean I think that the Microsoft has

480
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,440
the better idea you know well basically what they're trying to do with this is

481
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,040
that they're trying to put it themselves on equal footing with the Nintendo Wii

482
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,000
and basically then it's gonna be okay look these both of these systems have

483
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,000
you in the motion technology now let's compare the rest of the features and

484
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,600
when you compare the rest of the features the we just looks like

485
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,240
something for the last generation minute this thing comes out there will be that

486
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,720
bundle that includes move that they're really gonna be pushing the holiday

487
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:04,200
season hey it's a blu-ray and a we type thing in one that's that's what it is

488
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:09,560
that's Sony's strategy I'm sure it does everything it only does everything

489
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:15,160
except but to be fair I mean Sony's made a lot of made a lot of ground in the

490
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,320
past couple years I mean I think they've got to do this they're so way behind in

491
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:23,880
the numbers and it's it's a good idea but here's the other thing even with

492
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,800
the toll the toll is going to be the same problem I think and even to a

493
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,360
greater extent at least with the tall and I'll give them credit for this at

494
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:36,280
least in the tall I don't the fucking buy $320 with the controllers it's the

495
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:41,000
camera that's it done I don't have to make any more fucking purchases at all

496
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,800
well speaking of the tall I think dark soccer has got a story for us that kind

497
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,600
of talks about Microsoft although they didn't they didn't get to do the keynote

498
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,960
at GDC if that doesn't mean there's no news on the tall well um they're

499
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:58,440
basically stating that they're gonna have the full lineup of the natal titles

500
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:04,760
at e3 which will be cool of course they've got EA Capcom turn 10 spawn

501
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:10,720
point behind them and that they are quote putting their best people on the

502
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:18,520
on the job so uh they should actually be seeing some pretty good stuff this June

503
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:23,120
what big Xbox franchise do you think might natal be I mean I guess we've

504
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,720
heard fable already yeah my thought and I remember making this prediction earlier

505
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,400
in the year and I don't remember if it was on the show or on one of the forums

506
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,280
or what have you but I remember saying I think Gears of War 3 is gonna be

507
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:38,400
unveiled at e3 and it's gonna have natal support and it's kind of funny that

508
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,960
SOCOM showed up with the PlayStation move because when I saw that I was like

509
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,720
wow that's kind of that's kind of close ish that's like Playstations kind of

510
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:52,600
sudary type game as long as they take a mature approach with it like you know

511
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:58,000
where it's it makes sense for the game not just it seems tacked on as long as

512
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,400
they layling about like an idiot but they they Sony made a big point to say

513
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,320
you will not flail around like an idiot so if they do it right again I'm talking

514
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,720
out my ass it just seems like it's odd to me we have heard nothing about Gears

515
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:16,080
of War 3 I have this strange feeling you know it's gonna happen those games are

516
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:20,240
huge sellers I have this strange feeling that's the elephant behind the curtain

517
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,400
that's gonna show at e3 when dark soccer talks about they're bringing all their

518
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,580
natal titles I my gut tells me that's one of them oh I'm also though looking

519
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:31,320
in terms of course there's gonna be sports games that are gonna use it

520
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:35,120
although I would like to see how it would work with like a racing game if it

521
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:39,100
would be something like you foresee you know what I mean well I think they

522
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:42,020
showed in one of those previews right somebody was like grabbing us I think

523
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:45,240
there was like a racing game you see the little happy family grabbing a steering

524
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:50,120
wheel yeah you know natal I'm approaching with this big grain of salt

525
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:55,280
as to how well it's actually gonna work because I go I feel like it's like the

526
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,480
PlayStation I now granted the or not the I the I toy sorry granted the

527
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,480
technologies come a long way in the past few years I just really hope we see that

528
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:09,880
and I hope at e3 they show natal in a realistic environment and not against a

529
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,600
really well-lit white wall although you know that's what they're gonna do so

530
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:17,320
that it's super uber responsive because part of me is like how's this really

531
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:21,520
gonna work in my living room I want them to do it in front of a big red wall or

532
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,440
something or what a tacky curtain out of the 1970s I could see in my house or

533
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:31,600
like remember the we demo stations I had up at e3 that year with the couch mm-hmm

534
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,720
they just made little living rooms why don't they do something like that I'm

535
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,520
hoping that's what we see again I don't know e3 is a couple months away I don't

536
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:42,520
even know if I'm going at this point to be honest I want to go but I want to but

537
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:49,360
I have other priorities this year yeah not this year I just really the only

538
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,360
thing that I think right now is an advantage for them is that I don't buy

539
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:56,400
extra accessories because really that's gonna be just like and that's gonna be

540
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,760
a big I hope they push that it's okay hey look you gotta buy $320 worth of

541
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,400
crap and granted I'm throwing these numbers out my ass but I mean look at

542
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:14,480
the we lesser technology same price you know I gotta buy all this kind of extra

543
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:20,800
stuff to get to work versus its camera it's done you just plug it and go you

544
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:26,280
are the controller you know that's it but then again since I am the controller

545
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:32,080
I can only see ridiculous shit happening with that setup because they're gonna

546
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,120
make you flail around they're gonna make you do stupid shit that's unnecessary

547
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:40,400
just like those stupid little concept demo videos that they had where people

548
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:47,280
are screwing in nuts on a fucking tire in a race or something like that it's

549
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:53,120
unnecessary but they think of some really cool ways to like you know play

550
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:59,200
first-person shooters somehow more power to them I will see a little ways off but

551
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,240
again I think Microsoft's gonna have that same approach to Sony come the

552
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,120
holiday season now it's the Xbox 360 with in the tall or whatever they call

553
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:10,200
it I mean it's not gonna mean it's all I it's not gonna be that either it's kind

554
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,720
of weird they still have not announced the name but I guess like you know they

555
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,640
could still do it at e3 announce the name until they announce name it's funny

556
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,840
GDC I get it but but he threes it's fun up a little why they named it moved

557
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:24,680
right because they couldn't get the trademark for arc well really yeah who

558
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:29,080
had a trademark uh there's some some issue with them not being able to get

559
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:32,960
you get the trademark so they have to go with move instead I think PlayStation

560
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,960
moves a better name just from the because their logo still the arc but

561
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:42,680
it's an a looking thing I kind of think it's the better name for the mass market

562
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:47,120
I think a lot of other but then again what do I know the we what a dumb name

563
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:51,960
that was and yet it worked I tend to strategy why it worked I know simple

564
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:57,880
easy to remember easy market they made they made it into a adjective for games

565
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:03,400
like to Xerox something or to get a Kleenex they made the we just like how

566
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:07,720
people used to say oh we know we isn't we is not a generic yet no I know it's

567
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:12,200
not a generic but it's that got that household recognition it'd be like

568
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:19,680
bounty for paper towels all right let's move on with some more gaming news that

569
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:25,200
maybe don't involve motion well it might but we never know oh that's true that's

570
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:30,080
true that was something they're talking about but apparently though it has been

571
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:35,920
announced that Rockman 3 will be making its way out this holiday season not a

572
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,600
big surprise I mean they took kind of a year off file that next to duh and of

573
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:45,520
course yeah so I'll be out this this holiday season of course they said

574
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,200
that's going to innovate and then revolutionize the music genre once again

575
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:53,320
obviously they're gonna be adding of course you know the three-part harmonies

576
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:58,280
in there again in fact another game that will feature said three-part harmonies

577
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:03,200
is also Green Day Rock Band which has now been announced to be releasing on

578
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:10,440
June 8th worldwide also on the three major platforms Xbox 360 ps3 and we and

579
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:15,120
it's of course we'll use up to six players three mics three instruments and

580
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:22,600
they will also have apparently the ability to import the tracks as well or

581
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:27,760
export the tracks in the Rock Band 2 as well there's gonna be all 47 tracks that

582
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:33,000
are in the game will be exportable for I guess 10 bucks so it's basically

583
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,880
Beatles Rock Band but now with I'm day and you can export the tracks I don't

584
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:42,920
even see it as this this release to me is not even as big as Beatles Rock Band

585
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:48,080
I think this is more like guitar your own Metallica but at least you can

586
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:52,800
export the tracks can't do that shit with Metallica or Beatles or Van Halen

587
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,080
yeah or reels but Beatles that was a different situation it was kind of

588
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:01,200
Beatles are in a little category of their own to you know it Beatles is

589
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,160
there there's not a lot of bands that can get away with just being in their

590
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,240
own bubble the music game genre but Beatles can Green Day don't think

591
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,200
they're there yet but this this is this will be nice for them they have I mean

592
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,120
they have a lot of easily recognizable songs that you know I think the export

593
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:20,360
feature will be very popular too yeah and also they said that there's gonna be

594
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:27,320
a special edition Green Day Rock Band Plus that will come as to Xbox 360 and

595
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:33,440
ps3 for $69.99 includes fancier packaging and an export feature I guess

596
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,400
a voucher to export the discs to the hard drive and six previously released

597
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:43,360
Green Day DLC tracks um at depth in our chat room chat that owners on trading

598
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,920
com says also George Harrison's son already said that there would be a rock

599
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,080
band 3 and it will help you learn to play real instruments wouldn't that be

600
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:55,960
interesting if that's kind of the tie-in is is more making it real I don't know I

601
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:01,320
part of me says maybe there should be a new instrument but then I think it came

602
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:04,720
up a couple months ago on the show I think the idea had come up that maybe

603
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,560
what rock band 3 is gonna introduce is something like the sing star space where

604
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:13,280
you upload your own stuff to like a youtubey type of site I my gut tells me

605
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,080
that's gonna be rock band threes thing especially with the network taking off

606
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:22,160
as it is and so forth I think rock band 3 is gonna be really about now you can

607
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,920
watch your friends rock out from you know across the country all I gotta say

608
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,760
man is by the time that comes out I mean it's ridiculous the amount of tracks you

609
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:35,000
can have you can have like about over a thousand tracks right now that are in

610
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,800
that game I mean that's the way you do a music game right there you have the

611
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,360
download content I mean literally there's a whole library of stuff to pick

612
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:47,160
from and you can just take keep taking it with you through each and you know

613
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:52,480
reiteration of the game all right well moving on to other news kind of a

614
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,320
follow-up to last week you know obviously last week we had a very fun

615
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:58,640
show here at olr while the Oscars were going on but something else that was

616
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,800
going on at the time was that Ubisoft games were unplayable because they're

617
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,920
their whole service was down and apparently and I think I had suggested

618
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:13,440
this when somebody said it on the show it was indeed a DOS attack it sounds

619
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,240
like hackers went in servers were attacked which limited service from 2

620
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:23,880
30 p.m. to 9 p.m. Paris time 8 30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Eastern that was announced by by

621
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,880
the company on their Twitter so of course they wanted to cover their tracks

622
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:31,800
real quick saying oh but yeah most players 95% of players they weren't

623
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,160
affected yeah because most people were still sleeping on the west coast at that

624
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:39,360
time but still no I mean in all seriousness they tried to cover

625
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:43,360
themselves saying a bunch of players weren't affected probably because they

626
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:49,000
didn't try to play the game but again just kind of goes to show how their DRM

627
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,320
system is ridiculous and was already cracked as we talked about last week

628
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:57,160
correct yes because there's the code in there that very similar to steam if

629
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,280
steam ever goes bankrupt which I don't think they're going to anytime soon no

630
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,720
steam were to ever go under all those games would have to be activated without

631
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:08,280
steam's presence and Ubisoft's games have something similar someone found it

632
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:14,680
and went and unlock that for everybody hey what's this button do ah there it is

633
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:19,200
togak in our chat room says haha I hope they get DDoS more so they learn their

634
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:24,040
lesson I don't know if I'm really an advocate of DDoS thing but I think this

635
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:27,840
certainly shows the weakness of why this should have never been done in the first

636
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:36,520
place yep ah well how about something that's a little bit less irritating what

637
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:42,040
do you think Rob sure Akira Yomoka huh he's good to hear about him he is the

638
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:46,120
less irritating what's he up to lately I it's nice to hear him on a video game

639
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:49,640
podcast because you know when he left Konami there was a little worried that

640
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:53,520
oh he's leaving to go start a band or do something not to do with games

641
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:58,160
whatsoever we did a panel at game developers conference that I'm talking

642
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:05,000
about as long as audio is fun the game will be too that's what it was called but

643
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:11,960
he was talking about how the audio how the music goes into provoking a certain

644
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:18,440
emotion like it one of the examples given is that if you sync the sound just

645
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:22,880
off by a few frames of animation that like if you do it beforehand it'll give

646
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,360
a tone of anxiety to it but if you do it afterwards it's more comforting like

647
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:31,760
starting the sound of footsteps just a fraction of you know a moment before the

648
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,880
the action happens on the scene and they're talking about the use of silence

649
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:41,600
and he's quoted as saying when there's no sound the brain fills in the gap and

650
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:48,320
then actually went to play you know some music with with gaps of silence and then

651
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:53,040
went back in and added sharp sounds to it of course which freaked people out but

652
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:57,880
it was I think it's very effective and then he played some guitar for everybody

653
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:02,440
to chill him out I could see that because that's kind of silent Hills

654
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:05,160
thing is that sometimes it'll be very quiet when you're walking around all you

655
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:09,120
hear those footsteps that I'm sure are off sync like he talks about there you

656
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,680
walk around with the footsteps and all of a sudden you start hearing the radio

657
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,480
noise the very uncomfortable kind of noise and that's how you know something's

658
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,760
up interesting to kind of hear the science behind that it's it's it's

659
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:25,400
simple psychology I mean they even you know I remember back in the day when I

660
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:32,480
took music theory they were talking about the use of sharp dissonance or how

661
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:37,560
about are setting things in a certain key like setting thing if I remember

662
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:42,000
correctly setting things in the key of E is actually a very uncomfortable key to

663
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:48,120
listen to things in I mean the setting and see very neutral you know same type

664
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:52,880
of thing Wow there's a whole science behind it no word though about sadly

665
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,240
what he's working on now or what have you you know I was it wasn't there some

666
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,840
rumor something came up a while back that he was in cahoots with EA doing

667
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,960
something I want to say something had come up on the show like a while ago

668
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:08,400
maybe one of the chatters wants to fill in I seriously think though we haven't

669
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:17,800
heard on the article though yeah very cool all right let's travel around the

670

world and look at some release dates and what's coming out to a video game store

671
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:26,000
near you that maybe won't make you so uncomfortable well these games make me

672
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,200
uncomfortable because I can't believe that they're still being made well

673
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:34,080
technically this is not really a new game it's just kind of remade anyways

674

PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 kind of a cool game actually that one's a little

690
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,840
bit like Final Fantasy but instead of using like magic and stuff you actually

691
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:20,600
use like oozies and rocket launchers which is all sorts of cool hidden

692
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:26,040
mysteries Buckingham Palace secrets of kings and queens on the DS another

693
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:31,800

supposed to be coming out this week bundled with Halo 3 ODST and Forza 3

697
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,880
and that's it all right traveling over to Japan to look at the releases that

698
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:03,800
are coming out over there on the Xbox 360 Darksiders comes out kind of say

699
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:09,800
actiony ish game from Konami that I've seen described as God of War meets Zelda

700
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:16,960
I'm sure that's interesting also on the Xbox 360 Momo to Jai Dyson Ryaku ultra

701
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:22,000
deluxe comes out kind of a strategy type of game with these chibi little bombers

702
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,960
and of course anime girls as the captains but it looks kind of cute don't

703
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:29,560
think that'll be a game that comes out here though so you'll have to import

704
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:35,200
that one that's pretty much it on the Xbox 360 PlayStation 3 has some exciting

705
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,720
titles this week though PlayStation 3 is having something in Japan coming out

706
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:42,920
this week called torn and it's also coming out with a bundle and it's not a

707
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:48,060
game actually it's a DVR type system that I guess will turn your ps3 into a

708
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:51,480
DVR type thing with listings and everything and I'm just thinking wow I

709
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:54,560
wish something like that would come out here that sounds pretty awesome you hear

710
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:58,840
about this like on the 360 in Europe with the what the u-verse I think and

711
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:03,040
maybe that happens in like a limited capacity here but sadly you don't work

712
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:07,720
on my cable system but that is coming out in Japan this week very cool also

713
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:16,920
Ryu Ga Gotoku 4 Densetsu wo Sugumono 4 comes out this week in Japan I believe

714
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:22,240
that is Yakuza 4 which is kind of funny because we just got Yakuza 3 this week

715
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:27,200
in the u.s. so and of course is some of the articles that we've had recently on

716
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:31,320
orange laundry calm written by our lovely webmaster deke man they cut some

717
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:35,280
crap out of Yakuza 3 which is not making people happy I was thinking I was

718
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,080
Twitter you saying something like 20 different side quests and stuff we're

719
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:44,920
all cut so hopefully if they do decide to port Yakuza 4 which just came out on

720
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:50,520
the ps3 in Japan this week they will not cut so darn much also on the ps3 this

721
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:54,760
week in Japan the God of War collection it makes its way to Japan that's pretty

722
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:58,000
much it on the ps3 going to the Nintendo Wii there really isn't much there's just

723
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,280
one little title from Squeenix Oh Yaku de Asobo Miphi no Omocha Bako I

724
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,400
wouldn't get too excited because I said that was Squeenix it honestly looks like

725
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,480
like a Sesame Street type of game featuring little rabbit characters that

726
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:14,480
honestly their mouths look like buttholes like I don't have a better way

727
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:19,200
to explain it but if you look at their little mouths they look like balloon

728
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:25,600
knots and I wouldn't yeah get too excited about that but hey there you go

729
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:31,960
what are they showing to their children over there Sengoku Basara 2 on the

730
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:37,680
PlayStation 2 gets a price reduction this week and going over to the Nintendo

731
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:46,960
DS Haki Oki on the DS from idea factory a crayon game yay crayons and lastly

732
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:53,880
going to the PSP Gundam assault survive comes out and oh this is a fun one of it

733
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:58,400
Jamie will be excited for this ease one and two the seven set comes out in Japan

734
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,560
nice they've ported those games a couple times over in Japan haven't they I like

735
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:07,360
East I don't think I've seen him out over here oh I've got yes are they are

736
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:15,200
they okay very cool all right Kevo in our chat wants to know why did the hell

737
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,880
they cut so much of it I believe speaking about Yakuza 3 I believe long

738
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,720
story short there were some things that they felt were well a you could just say

739
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,000
they were being lazy but they rationalized it I think some of it was

740
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,720
like mahjong minigames which you know it's not really a huge game here in the

741
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:36,680
US so I guess they figured people would know how to play it and I think types of

742
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:40,800
just like social things that are big in Japan because you know you the Yakuza

743
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:46,240
series is very big on trying to like emulate what Japan is feeling like in a

744
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:50,280
certain era so there's a lot of like social things that are built into the

745
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:53,840
game and I guess Sega just felt some things were not worth translating or

746
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:56,620
trying to explain to the English audience but obviously some of the

747
00:57:56,620 --> 00:58:01,120
hardcore fans are a little ticked off I see a lot of friends of mine really into

748
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:04,060
this game though so I don't think it's really affecting you know I think if

749
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:07,840
you're a fan of Yakuza you're gonna grumble and cry but you still end up

750
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:16,040
playing it so all right let's move on to the UK dark Sakura on the 16th we have

751
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:23,160

754
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:52,680
all right okay let's see so one of the big things that they were talking about

755
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:58,760
during GDC and actually something that might be kind of talked about during e3

756
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:04,120
last year was on live the streaming service that's gonna be available for I

757
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:09,080
guess PCs and max that's gonna allow you to play basically a whole bunch of you

758
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:13,200
know big games everything from like crisis to you know just very casual

759
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:19,060
games and they're all gonna be able to be streamed I guess to your you know PC

760
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:25,320
with just you know very little hardware whatsoever and they announced that

761
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:30,880
they're gonna be launching their service June 17th and it will be $15 per month

762
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:40,400
and what's gonna you know offer this is depending on I guess you know they're

763
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,520
gonna have like a micro console that's gonna be released later on I guess like

764
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:51,280
a set-top box if you will that you can actually use instead of your PC and I

765
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:56,920
guess also you'll be able to they're gonna have some upgrades later on

766
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:02,520
they're gonna offer 1080p support at 60 frames per second as I guess more

767
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:09,280
bandwidth becomes available and on live I guess is gonna be going the first like

768
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:14,760
three months they're only only allow 25,000 people in I guess they're gonna

769
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:20,920
be staggering all when people can join up probably because they don't have all

770
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:25,040
their servers online but I mean I don't know if you're gonna want to jump on

771
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:28,120
board right away because really they're not gonna have a whole lot of titles

772
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:33,320
available at launch they're really only gonna have less than about 20 titles at

773
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:39,800
launch and it's gonna grow somewhere to about 50 to 60 games by 2011 some of the

774
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:46,240
games that they're gonna be available on the service they are mentioning that

775
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:52,480
Mass Effect 2 Dragon Age origins also later on Prince of Persia the Forgotten

776
01:00:52,480 --> 01:01:00,760
Sands will be available and apparently I guess 250,000 people signed up for the

777
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:05,680
online beta not that all of them were let in and it says they expect that

778
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:12,040
demand will far outweigh the capacity of the services servers and so that they're

779
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:15,240
gonna actually have people pre subscribe well of course they want to fluff it up

780
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:19,120
sold out hard to get into exclusive you know because they want to pump people up

781
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:23,280
I explain you know I'm not knocking this because certainly I think this story has

782
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:28,320
kind of come up before and you know it's kind of been just poo-pooed office oh

783
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:32,320
yeah sure that'll happen but now there's no really we're gonna have this out in

784
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:36,320
the fall and we plan to do this console and everything but explain to me real

785
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:39,560
quick and I realize there's a science behind this but I need it really broken

786
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:42,520
down for me here because I don't understand hardware so much how is this

787
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:50,280
not game tap this is basically I don't know I think it's gonna be more

788
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:56,240
sophisticated games basically it's not just like emulating old games or older

789
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:01,540
PC titles it's like you're you know say for example you have a crappy computer

790
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:06,120
that happens to be on a decent network you can run crisis now on it basically

791
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:12,480
with very little lag or no lag at all burnout you're gonna be able to run that

792
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:17,200
kind of stuff who knows if they'll go into a game tap type of situation later

793
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,960
on where they're gonna have older classic games and stuff like that what

794
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:23,600
was this also something about like maybe it's not really running on your computer

795
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,820
it's running on someone else's computer a server you're looking like through a

796
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:31,520
window type of thing basically yes that's so strange to me yeah cuz game tab

797
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:34,360
you have to wait for stuff to download to your computer so I'm assuming it's a

798
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:37,480
little different there and this also they're gonna also have a kind of an

799
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:43,040
online game portal that's gonna be free as well on top of all this stuff it's

800
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:49,400
basically like a browser-based streaming device they're also gonna have like you

801
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:54,960
know free streaming of selection of demos as well so I guess the limited

802
01:02:54,960 --> 01:03:00,680
number of full games for rent at for a per game fee without the monthly service

803
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:05,360
charge so kind of think of like what game tap did except not free you know

804
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:14,800
like their little free offerings I don't know it's it's interesting I just don't

805
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:20,000
know if I would really I would probably not use this I just don't play enough PC

806
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:26,040
games toy gak says if it runs on their computers I might be able to play modern

807
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:29,680
games again maybe that's I mean that's the whole like catch to this I think

808
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:33,600
that's yeah it's it's it's so it's kind of like having your PC as being a

809
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:38,640
console where she don't worry about your PC being up to spec to run these games

810
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:44,040
well you just have to have a fast enough internet connection and their PCs will

811
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:49,320
do the work for you interesting I'm really curious to see how this runs like

812
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:52,360
especially if it's if it's really that smooth because I would think I would

813
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:55,360
think that this would run into a similar problem is the whole Ubisoft thing is

814
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:59,760
that if your internet stops working the game stop working because how else are

815
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,720
you gonna get the data from the computer well yeah that's just goes with anything

816
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:07,640
as far as like streaming content goes you know you're on demand or anything if

817
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:12,800
your connections stops working then obviously yes it will shut off but

818
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:17,160
that's the same with like a phone call if your phone service goes out then your

819
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:22,880
phone call goes down but you know and I guess it would matter you know it would

820
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:26,880
be you have to make sure that your data center wherever that you're connecting

821
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:30,960
on live you know if their data center goes down or wherever nearby then yeah

822
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:34,480
you'd be kind of screwed chat let me pose this question to chat real quick is

823
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:39,400
on live something that interests you why or why not and I'll kind of ask the

824
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:42,200
folks the studio here the same question is on life something that interests you

825
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:47,360
why or why not logy no and the reason why is because I don't play a lot of PC

826
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:50,080
games anyways and a lot of the games that it seems like that they're gonna

827
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:54,120
have on here are also console crossovers which I would just play on a console on

828
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:58,760
my own time if I was doing that I don't see why honestly I don't have a lot of

829
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:01,600
time for games anyways nowadays and I only seem to be playing like one game

830
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:07,680
at a time I can't see myself paying $15 a month for this I'm gonna say no for

831
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:12,400
the same reasons that Loki said well I should I'm I'm interested like I'm

832
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:17,440
curious to see how it works in action but I think Loki hit the nail on the

833
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:20,840
head console crossovers most of this is already the stuff that's on consoles and

834
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:24,840
and I built my PC to run crisis so god damn it if I'm gonna play crisis it's

835
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:29,800
gonna be running on my PC Dark Sakura I don't know if this is something that

836
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:33,720
would interest you on live being able to have your low-end computer stream the

837
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:42,160
games I don't really care about that honestly you know if I'm gonna if I'm

838
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:46,520
gonna play my live games I'm just gonna sit down and play them on my Xbox kick

839
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:52,120
down off of Borderlands all right am I is something wrong with Chad I got

840
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:56,000
really quiet in there I'm a little worried chat orange launch radio.com

841
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,840
it's all the hallucinogens I piped through the internet keep in mind

842
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:01,760
there's also a delay so when I say something it takes like a minute just

843
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,880
because we encode to all games who encodes to the shout you know and

844
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:07,880
dah-dah-dah-dah so there's a little bit of a delay between when we say things

845
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:11,440
when they hit the chat room but finally we're getting some feedback here on act

846
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:16,880
deaf in our chat room says no because in Mexico if the service will even be

847
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,940
available here we don't have a really good connection speed it's gonna be

848
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:25,880
laggy as hell probably Bochi Kawa says interested but really I don't find it

849
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:30,680
worth it yeah I mean you know you're asking someone to pay an extra

850
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:34,400
subscription fee a month but it's it feels to me like that's the other thing

851
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,400
is paying for something that I could just go sit in the other room well you

852
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:42,920
still have to pay for games on the Xbox well yeah but pay more well how is it

853
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:47,240
different from a gamefly account I don't have a gameplay account I would think a

854
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:51,440
gamefly account would be the better option if you ask me granted you can't

855
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:55,600
stream a whole bunch of different games at a time but you got to ask yourself

856
01:06:55,600 --> 01:07:00,480
really are you playing like 10 games at a time I mean are you gonna go on the

857
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:03,720
service and go hey you know what I'm gonna play 12 different games this month

858
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:10,080
I mean that's great to think that you might do that but in all reality you're

859
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:14,560
probably not gonna it's gonna be hard to keep track of what's going on in each

860
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:18,840
different game and I know you know back to the day I even then I still didn't

861
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:22,720
really play a ton of different games I'm usually playing one game to completion

862
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:25,760
or till I get tired of it and move on to something else you're not gonna see I'm

863
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:29,440
the opposite I'm gamer a DD all the way I play one thing and then what not

864
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:33,600
again what but like the fact that I'm playing Final Fantasy 13 two weeks in a

865
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:38,440
row pretty solidly is is really it's it's an event like if you listen to past

866
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:42,280
months of this show didn't go find another game that I have that much

867
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:45,600
attention you wouldn't feel lost if he didn't have like these other you know

868
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:52,920
options like I mean I I just don't see you know 40 or 50 games on there I guess

869
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:59,320
that would be a good value but it's just I wouldn't see myself using it a couple

870
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:03,360
of the quick thoughts here from our chat room alpha-kin anagram seems to think

871
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:06,800
that it's Pokemon that's distracting all our chatters tonight everybody's a busy

872
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:10,120
catching their mudkips and they're little they're little balls that they

873
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:13,600
run around with now because basically they took the walking trainer and

874
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:17,720
incorporated that into a Pokemon game am I correct mm-hmm okay thank you I used

875
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:23,120
to have the old it's like bringing back Tamagotchi I swear to God that thing

876
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:26,760
looks like a Tamagotchi remember the old Pokemon Pikachu things that you just

877
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:30,360
attached to your belt the pedometer thing that's what it is why no but

878
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:34,480
remember the old ones well they do it would to compete with Tamagotchis

879
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:39,440
essentially right like they're making all new again all you need to do is you

880
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:44,120
download one of those free Xbox 360 massagers plug in the fucking controller

881
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:49,160
into the duct tape that little Walker thing on there set it to vibrate at the

882
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:52,920
new high setting to before you know it you'll be good to go all right I'll

883
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:57,000
paint shaker but a couple other quick thoughts from our chat room on the on

884
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:01,840
live Akuma JP says yes if it is cheaper I would like to play games for my net

885
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:07,120
book net book is a good thought if it's a tune for net books net books could be

886
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:12,800
gaming devices very interesting IK ripper says maybe most likely no there

887
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:16,200
you go thoughts from our chat room chat dot orange on twitter.com speaking of

888
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:20,960
moving and pedometers and all that shit EA Sports active 2.0 is announced and

889
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:25,480
it's coming out for the Wii the ps3 and the iPhone oddly enough nothing said yet

890
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:29,440
on the 360 I can't believe though with project at all on the horizon they

891
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:32,800
aren't cooking something up for the 360 but my assumption is it's probably

892
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:37,840
different probably much different anyhow EA Sports active they are getting a

893
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:41,560
proper sequel not like a spin-off type thing like you've seen happen with the

894
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:45,120
first set I think they had like more exercises or whatever but a proper sequel

895
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:48,640
the console version of the game now they're gonna come with two motion

896
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:54,760
sensors and a heart rate monitor you strap on your arm and leg interesting

897
01:09:54,760 --> 01:10:00,000
so it's gonna measure your heart rate now by the way you can share this

898
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,480
information over social networks online so I'm assuming you're gonna be able to

899
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:08,640
Facebook your EA active progress goody goody EA Vancouver is developing it one

900
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:11,800
other thing I noticed it looks like almost like a little USB thing that you

901
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:14,840
could like plug into your iPhone or something almost like a little dongle if

902
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:19,160
you will for your iPhone or of course iPod touch with that so very

903
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:22,800
interesting you want to know why it's not coming out on the 360 because 360

904
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:27,760
hasn't at all nope that's not why it's all right why 360 here's why one for the

905
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:32,400
heart rate monitor for the Wii you've got your stupid vitality sensor that it

906
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:38,760
will probably support to the Xbox 360 doesn't like Microsoft does not like

907
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:46,280
licensing out their wireless technology for any peripheral really they've done

908
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:49,640
it with you know the rock band guitars and the guitar hero guitars but that's

909
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:58,080
about it the wireless technology it mostly everything has to be wired so I

910
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:01,360
mean obviously since these devices are wireless you're not gonna be able to

911
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:08,000
create some sort of wired device to plug in with you know the Xbox 360 a little

912
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:13,280
USB shit could go in yeah but they don't do that kind of stuff that's why it's

913
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:18,720
it's different they have certain specifications at the meet also play

914
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:24,400
nice with each other I I still think you're I can't believe that you'll EA

915
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:31,720
is a big big backer of 360 it's gonna be the tall that's the that's why all

916
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:36,520
right anyhow I could be wrong but I'm probably not let's get into our classic

917
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:40,400
game of the week is where I get into the end of part a believe it or not and we

918
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:44,840
always like to end the first half of our show by taking a trip down memory lane

919
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:49,000
where dark soccer is going to visit one of our classic video games from

920
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:53,720
yesteryear the classic of the week dark Sakura what video game should all the

921
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:57,320
boys and girls out there be enjoying this week the game of the week is

922
01:11:57,320 --> 01:12:05,800
grottiest to grottiest to and keep now I have to make a mention it is not the

923
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:11,800
grottiest to that is that we got out as nemesis to for the nest this is

924
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:18,840
grottiest to for the arcade and PC engine listen the music for a minute

925
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:33,320
yes if you play Konami series of music games you heard this remix before that

926
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:38,880
is where burning heat came from that's why when you're actually playing the

927
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:43,600
music you shoot you know it shows the the sun's with the little snakes coming

928
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:49,120
out of the you know the fire um grottiest to it was the gratitude to

929
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:56,240
the ambition of gopher it was it came out in 1988 in Japan and it was the

930
01:12:56,240 --> 01:13:00,640
direct sequel to grottiest and the prequel to glad grottiest three of

931
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:06,600
course there were versions that came out for the Famicom the PC engine in the x68

932
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:13,280
thousand and it is it has been we released the PC engine version and

933
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:19,080
Famicom versions are out on the virtual console well not in North America until

934
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:25,080
it came out in grottiest collection that came out in 2006 and then the

935
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:31,760
international releases on the virtual console grottiest to came out in Europe

936
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:36,840
in the arcades under the name of Vulcan venture so yes more fun with the Vic

937
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:46,800
Viper and it did bring in some of the stuff that came from salamander or life

938
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:51,000
force as when the other names and also I'm sorry but I think it's really

939
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,400
important just basically reading chat it's really important to make this

940
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:57,560
distinction people think life force is grottiest too because of the way these

941
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:00,720
games were marketed to us as children is that a lot of us thought life force was

942
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:04,360
a secret audience but they're actually two separate series in Japan there was

943
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:08,800
salamander and it was grottiest we never got the actual grottiest too well not

944
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:16,000
back in the NES days we got it later which I'm sure nemesis too was was like

945
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:21,480
the life force grottiest and not guys life for salamander that's what that's

946
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:24,600
a bit just a very common whoopsie because you know and again when I was a

947
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:27,600
kid I thought life force with the sequel to grottiest because they look the same

948
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:31,040
they felt the same but two different Japanese series that are just very

949
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:36,280
similar well um one of the good things that came with this one is also the

950
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:43,240
first one that had the boss rush they had levels with there were only boss

951
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:48,080
confrontations so it's pretty cool so yeah you had you can pick your different

952
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:54,280
weapon system so that as you picked up power-ups you can choose which of your

953
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:58,240
different power-ups you could do like you could speed up you had options you

954
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:06,920
had missile double laser the ripple sucks by the way it always has now when

955
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:11,880
this came out on the Famicom it was one of the games that had a mapper chip to

956
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:16,920
increase the graphics and sound a lot of games in Japan had that the Nintendo

957
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:23,460
being big sticklers here in the US they actually had to have they a lot of you

958
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:27,040
know games were a lot better overseas because they couldn't bring them out

959
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:34,140
with anything other than the type the proprietary carts over here remember so

960
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:39,720
there was the PC engine version in 1992 that came out as a super CD-ROM which I

961
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:47,960
have a burn and one by the way one could argue that that's why this game never

962
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:51,800
came out in the u.s. is because the specialized car and why Konami instead

963
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:56,320
took the approach to kind of market life force as a sequel to Gradius basically

964
01:15:56,320 --> 01:16:02,000
this is one of the games that I'm looking for a legit one by the way it is

965
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:09,120
just so awesome is so so if this has this is my favorite gradius game there's

966
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:15,480
also they added an additional stage though for the PC engine version that

967
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:20,200
came from the nest version of life force that was also the first stage of gradius

968
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:25,360
3 it also came out and for the gradius deluxe pack for PlayStation Saturn and

969
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:32,800
Windows in 96 and then came out worldwide gradius collection for the PSP

970
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:44,560
the of course the PC engine version was a Hanabi festival game in 2008 and of

971
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:48,540
course there's always sweet spots at every boss battle that's right that one

972
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:56,940
spot you got a hit to kill it fast and ripple does suck I agree alright there

973
01:16:56,940 --> 01:17:01,320
it is your classic game of the week gradius 2 that little clip coming to you

974
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:04,880
from the PC engine but it's it was one reason to ever take the ripple lasers

975
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:10,880
because the progression afterwards had didn't have double yeah double was in

976
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:15,180
yeah I mean the one that came after ripple it was it was I think it was your

977
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:19,480
other option mm-hmm I know there was always a reason to take the ripple route

978
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:24,360
but you just always bypass ripple tiger glass a good question is a valid

979
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:28,600
question for Jack just gradius to have vertical stages no no that was unique to

980
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:31,840
the salamander series salamander that was part of what made that series unique

981
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:36,840
yeah it was vertical stages good question though again all that all the

982
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:41,240
marketing changes and stuff from Japan over here kind of screwed us up as a kid

983
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:45,120
you know when Final Fantasy 7 came out who didn't ask where the hell was fourth

984
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:50,480
through six I think I thought it was kind of cool they're like yeah we know I

985
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:53,680
think by then a lot of people have figured it out but you know all right

986
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:57,040
anyhow we're gonna take a break here at orange launch radio we got plenty more

987
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:01,840
coming up some quick news when we come back about DJ hero and Tron yes and

988
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:06,120
we'll see that trailer for the new Tron movie looks sweet but I got to say well

989
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:10,560
actually no I take it back the movie is probably gonna be ridiculous but the

990
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:15,160
score by Daft Punk sounds amazing just even based on that little trailer I saw

991
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:25,360
gotta say very cool all right um let's see also news on XNA and Nintendo and

992
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:28,760
another Hanabi festival coming up we're gonna get into all of that a little

993
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:32,280
later on in part B of our show so don't go anywhere we'll be right back with

994
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:42,760
more of orange lounge radio and welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio on

995
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:47,400
this Sunday night March 14th of 2010 that's right pie day hope you're

996
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:50,600
enjoying some pie we're not really having pie in studio which is a bit

997
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:53,880
surprising I'm kind of full though I had fast food on the way over to the show

998
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:57,440
driving back from San Francisco sadly I was I was in San Francisco but not a

999
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:01,320
game developers conference but you know I'm not a game developer and you know

1000
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:05,440
you have to be one of the big media companies that's a magazine or whatever

1001
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:08,480
to get in there but that's okay although I think I would find the topics

1002
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:12,920
fascinating like you know I I kind of like the science of game development and

1003
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:16,280
stuff you know I understand that it's not really a media event that's what

1004
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:19,520
e3 is for so I'm not gonna be all butthurt I'm not going although I wish I

1005
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:24,480
I wish I could have crashed some of the sweet parties try the move stuff out but

1006
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:28,520
that's about it it's all gonna be at e3 in a couple months anyway yeah so I'm

1007
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:31,880
not you know too worried about it I mean of course I don't even know if I'm going

1008
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:35,440
to e3 this year I am definitely not going to do that out sorry to hear it it's

1009
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:40,840
just you know it's it's a strain to try to go you know each year anyways and I

1010
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:45,640
kind of I gotta take a day a year off I mean like last year remember we went it

1011
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:50,320
was kind of like yeah this is cool I feel like there's really more I want to

1012
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:55,640
see this year between the portal to the final has he 14 the move the Natal all

1014
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:03,400
stuff I want to see this year so it seems like there's more to it in good

1015
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:09,960
time I don't know it's just I don't know all right well let's get into some

rapid-fire news and then we're gonna get in some Twitter topics as well so you

1019
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:26,800
right Loki start us off with some quick news tonight well Activision surprised

1020
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:33,520
us whoo they have new download content coming out to DJ hero unfortunately I

1021
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:38,160
don't give a flying fuck about it and this is really sad I mean unless you're

1022
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:42,120
a fan of you've been asking for it for for oh yes I've been asking for it I was

1023
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:45,760
hoping that they would I don't know put out some good download content and

1024
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:50,880
granted you know I guess if you like Eminem and jay-z you probably would have

1025
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:55,720
bought the renegade edition I didn't so I didn't and therefore I'm not buying

1026
01:20:55,720 --> 01:21:00,120
this either but for the sake of reporting it I will tell you what three

1027
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:06,600
mixes they have in there shake that mixed with show me what you got without

1028
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:14,160
me mixed with encore and can I get a mix with lose yourself and I've I've watched

1029
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:20,440
the the video previews of these and let me just say I'm about as excited about

1030
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:26,280
these songs as I have been describing these songs to you it's seriously awful

1031
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:30,360
really what you're more of a trance guy anyway I mean and yeah that's fine but I

1032
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:35,320
even gave the last the extended mix pack whatever I gave that chance and I didn't

1033
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:40,880
really check up I downloaded the David Guada stuff but I did I like that I have

1034
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:47,200
not and maybe I'll go back to that but I like the other pack to the there was

1035
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:53,160
there was a what was it gorillas and something oh the the honor all of me and

1036
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:57,760
radio gaga yeah that's my favorite of the whole freaking gayest extended mix

1037
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:01,960
yeah and that's in the that download mix is and there I think gorilla song was in

1038
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:06,600
the other song in there but yeah I I have to me I realized Eminem jay-z they

1039
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:12,520
sell bazillions of albums but I'm just not I'm like I don't mind I know

1040
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:15,560
whatever not for me but I understand there's an audience for it I wouldn't

1041
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:19,160
mind those songs like if there's an Eminem song mix with like you know Queen

1042
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:23,000
or something like something different you know I'm like the stuff that was in

1043
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:28,280
the game I don't really care for to our you know rap R&B songs mixed together

1044
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:34,520
and the same time also it's just like really how long have I had to wait for

1045
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:40,240
another download pack I'm sorry but this is kind of like you know an insult to me

1046
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:44,280
it's just like yeah you know we're just gonna let you know that it's out there

1047
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:47,760
and I have DJ here on my Twitter you know they're on my Twitter and stuff and

1048
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:52,160
like you know putting these retweets for like stupid shit like artists going oh

1049
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:56,840
my god DJ here it's so cool it's like seriously you know when the fuck are you

1050
01:22:56,840 --> 01:23:01,160
gonna download or add some more download content you support this stuff but then

1051
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:05,640
again we're talking Activision here so you really I've just got to wait for

1052
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:11,040
some sort of DJ game from harmonix or EA before I get that real download content

1053
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:15,960
because I sure as hell I'm not gonna get it with Activision so what about scratch

1054
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:23,320
the ultimate DJ yeah when's that coming out I haven't seen that yet well I think

1055
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:27,720
it's coming out around the time dude Newcomb forever is coming out and never

1056
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:31,520
anyways if you're interested in purchasing these they are available on

1057
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:38,360
March 18th for $8 or 640 Microsoft points and the tracks will not be sold

1058
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:45,000
separately so yeah however if you are on the Wii guess what you are in luck

1059
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:50,760
because you get them for a dollar more that's right there sold as single

1060
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:56,280
downloads for 300 300 we points and that's a total of $9 for each so guess

1061
01:23:56,280 --> 01:24:03,680
what you get to pay the Wii Premium okay I'm done there now what is kind of neat

1062
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:08,040
is they're gonna be adding a new way to navigate PlayStation home apparently

1063
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:13,160
it's kind of take of the cross-media bar and the way they're doing it is they're

1064
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:16,200
gonna be able to go to different spaces like for example you can favorite

1065
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:22,800
different spaces you like going to you can go to you know personal spaces you

1066
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:26,160
know whatever it'll make a lot I forgot that came out this week it'll be a lot

1067
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:29,360
quicker to like kind of bounce from one place to another without having to walk

1068
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:33,080
aimlessly through and I do anything with the olr club yet which by the way is

1069
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:37,400
full I keep getting requests for the club and unfortunately I'm limited 25

1070
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:40,760
members and I keep get like I seriously get new requests to join the club like

1071
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:44,240
every other day which I'm flattered and thank you all for wanting to join but

1072
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:47,480
unfortunately it's full so until Sony will let us have like I don't know 50

1073
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:51,360
people 100 people all your apps are just sitting there waiting to be approved

1074
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:55,400
until like I'm not rejecting them I'm just not answering them it because I'm

1075
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:59,800
hoping that one day Sony's gonna say hey we're gonna make clubs useful and I can

1076
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:04,360
have 50 or 100 probably just they can't physically you know handle that many

1077
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:08,520
people in one space at a time or in that close that's a bunch of ball because if

1078
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:11,880
you go to the main space area you can see more than 25 people there at a time

1079
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:16,960
no offense I just yeah but if that's Sony's line I claim bullshit yeah but

1080
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:21,320
how many servers are running that one space or I don't know whatever they're

1081
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:25,320
just not doing it but you know what I'm not going on home either so I this

1082
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:28,560
doesn't mean anything to me as well yeah I wonder if there's gonna be a theme

1083
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:34,800
going on here but let's find out this is kind of neat apparently people think

1084
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:38,240
that you're gonna have the power of the ps3 in your pocket within three years

1085
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:46,040
the group imagination technologies maker of the power of VR chips says that I

1086
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:50,280
guess powers like you know smartphones like iPhones the Droid and whatnot they

1087
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:55,440
said that they you'll have graphics comparable to ps3 in three years and the

1088
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:58,520
reason is because they're designing the chips right now for that kind of stuff

1089
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:05,000
apparently they're working with different new groups to license things

1090
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:11,400
you know you know like Apple HTC whatnot they're saying that in three years

1091
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:14,640
imagination says you're gonna have a ps3 in your pocket and it's not gonna be

1092
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:20,120
running at 40 by 340 resolution that most smartphones have now but it's

1093
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:26,920
actually gonna be like a 720p output via HDMI to a TV that would be something

1094
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:29,880
that phone that outputs to a TV via HDMI

1095
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:40,040
interesting and yeah they go into a lot more detail of course on different

1096
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:45,000
technologies are out there and stuff but you can only imagine though that as you

1097
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,400
know time goes on I mean the technology is just growing you know and at you

1098
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:53,560
know geometric rate that of course I can imagine you know I was actually having

1099
01:26:53,560 --> 01:27:00,000
that kind of technology soon within like next five years well yeah that seems a

1100
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,040
little aggressive seeing as if you go by the whole like Nintendo is is one off

1101
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:09,520
from the you know consoles with their handhelds meaning that the DS is kind of

1102
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:13,000
like a 64 just like the advance was kind of like a super Nintendo then the next

1103
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,480
handheld for Nintendo will be kind of like a GameCube funny that you mentioned

1104
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:20,080
that actually oh oh I have something they'll be for last-minute stories for

1105
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:23,360
that I can cover it now if you why not yes please please don't make me wait

1106
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:28,600
any longer I need to know I need to know I'm dying apparently there's a rumor

1107
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:32,000
about ds2 of course there's always a rumor about you there's always some damn

1108
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:37,240
remember um according to somebody sources within GDC I'm not gonna read

1109
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:40,640
through the article to see who exactly is quoting here that it's in the

1110
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:43,480
developers hands and apparently they're not having trouble developing for it

1111
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:48,120
because it's basically a GameCube power wise and everyone knows how to develop

1112
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:51,720
for a GameCube because they've been doing it for quite a while with both

1113
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:56,120
well because the Wii is a GameCube too basically yes the little the thing is

1114
01:27:56,120 --> 01:28:00,880
you know it's gonna be interesting this is apparently the people are familiar

1115
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:04,760
with the dev kit made it sound like there wasn't much learning curve on the

1116
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:09,920
new system and that devs who worked on GameCube or Wii games will find it easy

1117
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:14,120
to create with also they said that apparently the system has a built-in

1118
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:18,480
accelerometer and two big higher resolution screens that are closer

1119
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:25,000
together so that they can more easily be used as one screen and I guess the

1120
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,480
biggest bit of news however is that the devs say that they'll be done with their

1121
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:33,760
games by the end of 2010 meaning that we may see an announcement at e3 well

1122
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:36,280
it's kind of something we've been thinking for a while it's gonna happen

1123
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:40,960
yeah despite the DS IX L I told you if they could do the micro so close to the

1124
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:46,720
DS they can do the XL and have ds2 out 83 despite all their responses to the

1125
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:49,840
cause you know I like the idea of bringing the two screens closer together

1126
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:52,880
to make one big screen I think that's kind of cool yeah I wonder if they're

1127
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:59,000
both be tons of touch sensitive this time right yeah why not and by the way

1128
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,680
just pro tip Nintendo if it's gonna run on like GameCube II type hardware f0 ok

1129
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:08,440
thanks all right and just because it runs on GameCube type hardware does not

1130
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:12,200
mean that I want to see fucking ports of every single GameCube game that you guys

1131
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:17,000
put out okay do some new shit seriously well at least unless it's Wind Waker

1132
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:21,600
Wind Waker I will accept the rest of them except every time zero I reject

1133
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:27,480
them all all right and for the gods sake please you know maybe add some more

1134
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:30,680
buttons to the face like an analog stick or something like that so that we can

1135
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:34,440
actually play games in traditional sense seven these like remember remember they

1136
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:37,720
used to have that like thumb stylus thing that you would have to strap to

1137
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:43,320
your finger they came with yes yes I do what were yeah I know that you could use

1138
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:46,720
that in the mario 64 game to kind of control it uh-huh yeah it didn't didn't

1139
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:50,680
really work yeah all right anyhow let's go a little old-school let's go very

1140
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:54,560
old-school Donkey Kong of course there's a whole movie made out of the Battle of

1141
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:58,240
the Donkey Kong high scores the King of Kong remember that it was Billy Mitchell

1142
01:29:58,240 --> 01:30:01,880
Steve Weeby Ryan and good versus evil or whatever you however you want to look at

1143
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:05,880
it well guess what the whole movie has just been made irrelevant because there

1144
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:11,960
is a new king in town and it's neither it's a new guy who Hank Chien is his

1145
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:15,640
name he's a plastic surgeon from New York he has beaten Billy Mitchell's

1146
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:18,760
record Billy Mitchell by the way had one million fifty thousand two hundred

1147
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:23,520
points built our Hank sorry Hank has scored one million sixty one thousand

1148
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:28,920
seven hundred points officially verified by twin galaxies an original Donkey Kong

1149
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:33,600
cabinet machine in New York is how he said it congrats to him now he can star

1150
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:39,760
in the sequel after a leading his high score he was heard quoted saying suck it

1151
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:45,760
bitch yeah a tape has just arrived at twin galaxies from Billy Mitchell believe

1152
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:51,360
it or not or who was it that was saying that like the the other person's high

1153
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:56,520
score was like false or something like that like there was one of the two guys

1154
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:59,160
that were complaining people get really into I don't know I didn't watch the

1155
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:02,440
you know when I watched the movie I was just like damn people really get into

1156
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:06,120
this shit but then I'm like oh I host a podcast on the internet about video

1157
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:09,520
games like well I want to hold the high score for something really stupid that

1158
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:14,760
you know I want to be all pompous hey I remember when we went to classic gaming

1159
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:18,520
Expo one year and they were doing like the official twin galaxies high score

1160
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:23,600
for I think it was stampede on the 2,600 that I played stampede dude I think I

1161
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:27,720
was like last place for the day I was so fucking terrible at stampede but the guy

1162
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:30,760
was trying to give me tips and stuff and what he was saying made a lot of sense

1163
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:35,200
but I was just like wow when I was a kid I didn't think about these games like

1164
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:38,400
that like the tips and everything he was trying to give me like I was just like I

1165
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:44,040
just tried to lasso the horse thingies anyhow hey Tron something else from my

1166
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:47,800
childhood of course Tron legacy that trailer hit the internet this week and I

1167
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:53,300
gotta say although I my expectation bar for Tron like legacy is very very low

1168
01:31:53,300 --> 01:32:00,600
because Tron wasn't really a good movie per se it was just as an awesome movies

1169
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:04,760
what it was one of those things that you just you like it better because you're a

1170
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:11,120
kid and you know just the technology it's cool it's cool cycles it's not so

1171
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:15,960
much good it's just cool so Tron legacies coming out I gotta say despite

1172
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:18,320
the fact that the expectation bar for the movies are very low you know I'm

1173
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:21,760
gonna be seeing it opening day okay you know I'm gonna go just like many of you

1174
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:27,840
the score by Daft Punk sounds awesome like what's a word that's better than

1175
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:33,880
awesome more awesome awesomer super off more awesomer than a lot of game

1176
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:37,200
soundtracks out there well anyhow there's another track tie into Tron

1177
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:41,960
legacy going on it's called arcade aid apparently if you actually go into the

1178
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:46,620
Flynn lives website you can get this this picture that references I guess

1179
01:32:46,620 --> 01:32:50,760
they say 56 different arcade games old-school arcade games like I see

1180
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:54,080
burger time like there's a little burger with a clock so that's one of the oops

1181
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:58,280
I gave one away sorry but I totally dig the space paranoid signs still on the

1182
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:03,000
building it's very similar to like I've seen something similar in Rolling Stone

1183
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:07,240
that like had all these different band names as a picture like somebody

1184
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:11,240
smashing a pumpkin there get it all these things like that I already did all

1185
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:17,880
these like for example Goldeneye Star Fox Sea Wolf I see Kongo Bongo there at

1186
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:21,920
the bottom no that's actually Donkey Konga Frogger because it's a donkey and

1187
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:28,400
classic game I know shadow Colossus Frogger outrun because it's an

1188
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:34,940
outrunning huh funny spoil everything geez well that's what I do that one

1189
01:33:34,940 --> 01:33:41,680
right there is Bertie King it's a golf game time splitters bomber made sheet it

1190
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:47,200
off a website in you know I actually figured thank you can thank me putting

1191
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:51,360
together my main cabinet for being aware of all these different because a lot of

1192
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:55,760
the stuff I have themes for my hyper spin stuff so you know the names became

1193
01:33:55,760 --> 01:34:00,400
familiar I actually did you can ask my co-worker because I sat there for the

1194
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:03,840
first hour that day that it came out during the day and just working on that

1195
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:08,200
SSJ 100 as she 100 Matt says it was a good B movie Tron that is that's a good

1196
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:11,720
way of just finding it I like Tron for the same reason I like showgirls it's so

1197
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:18,800
bad you are a horror darlin I love Tron actually good movie to me end of line

1198
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:22,880
have you seen the game trailer for Tron legacy I have doesn't it remind you of

1199
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:28,200
force unleashed hmm I wasn't thinking of it that way but yeah I just I love the

1200
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:31,360
old-school Tron arcade game and that was awesome but of course it's one of those

1201
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:34,080

can remember hotel desk yes the company that made it sing is a to over 200

1236
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:26,520
million in debt they also did another code they did town factory for little

1237
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:32,240
king story and last window yeah we better buy some more of their copies of

1238
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:35,840
again which is coming out at the end of this month because that was also by the

1239
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:42,800
them I think they filed for bankruptcy on March 1st 200 million yen so we need

1240
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:47,480
to sell 200 million copies of that game I know you can do it um the final new

1241
01:37:47,480 --> 01:37:51,560
character for Street Fighter 4 has been released and it's a big red dude covered

1242
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:56,840
in oil wearing what looks like a hat made out of Legos on his head and he's a

1243
01:37:56,840 --> 01:38:01,760
grappler and he slides and he's a splashing oil everywhere this is

1244
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:07,440
actually kind of sploogeworthy so I I gotta give props to Alan he recognized

1245
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:11,000
what they were referencing he's a Turkish oil wrestler it's this big thing

1246
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:15,880
in in other countries like of Turkey where they douse themselves in what

1247
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:20,960
appears to be ky jelly type of substance and wrestle each other it is pretty

1248
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:26,400
homorific but no homo I've I've heard of it it's just the the screen captures

1249
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:30,040
like dude you're red Greco Roman normally what's that isn't that like

1250
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:34,560
Greco Roman oh I don't know he told me it was he told me to google image search

1251
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:39,440
Turkish oil wrestling and let's just say I got a lot of guys who didn't look

1252
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:49,440
quite as bad as that guy okay not wearing a blue Lego hat also is it

1253
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:57,560
Mullen you yeah well I know whatever um anyway the guy who makes fable yeah

1254
01:38:57,560 --> 01:39:03,520
really but basically saying that comparing natal and move he said well

1255
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:06,520
move is a good step in the right direction but it's not as big as natal

1256
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:14,680
and he's not biased or anything well says first-party developer for Microsoft

1257
01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:18,520
saying that that move is going to be more for the casual market and natal is

1258
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:25,640
going to be more for the immersive gamer so fable 3 will blow your mind except it

1259
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:30,680
won't to be exactly like the last two games but he'll claim that it like blows

1260
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:41,960
your mind it blows you I I'm interested to see what what the natal Lincoln is

1261
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:47,160
but they do say on that natal is not mandatory for fable 3 which I also like

1262
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:58,040
I will allow you to slap a bitch Oh Loki what we do without you here at

1263
01:39:58,040 --> 01:40:01,400
orange lounge radio we would die that's what would happen we would die how about

1264
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:06,160
some Twitter topics speaking of death no actually we have some good questions

1265
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:08,320
tonight we have some really good questions on the Twitter twitter.com

1266
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:11,960
slash olr I'm going to allow usually I don't allow more than one question a

1267
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:16,720
person but M and Ziba has a couple good ones tonight so I will I will grant an

1268
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:22,120
exception M and Ziba asking what is the deal with the chocobo what is the deal

1269
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:28,560
with the chocobo in Final Fantasy 13 is there a use for it or is it just there

1270
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:32,400
to look cute and to make it a Final Fantasy game I think it's a little bit

1271
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:36,640
the second part it is there to look cute and make it a little more of a Final

1272
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:41,720
Fantasy game because since there is no like world map type thing they had to

1273
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:45,280
incorporate a chocobo I think another way one big bitch about the game by the

1274
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:48,880
way is that there's no Final Fantasy victory music you never hear doo doo doo

1275
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:52,760
doo doo doo doo doo you never hear that but there at least there's a chocobo um

1276
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:57,440
I will say this though they do treat the chocobo as a character and I think

1277
01:40:57,440 --> 01:41:00,160
that's what makes this a little bit unique compared to the other Final Fantasy

1278
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:03,640
games like you know if you go into the bio cards you know when you're looking

1279
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:07,440
into data log which is like a memory bank section of the game so you can read

1280
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:11,240
what's going on all the characters have their little profiles with the data log

1281
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:16,320
the chocobo has his own entry so I don't know if maybe the chocobo becomes more

1282
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:20,800
relevant later in the story but he's awfully cute I want a fat chocobo to

1283
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:24,040
hold your items yeah it's all my items it'd be awesome if he has a playable

1284
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:29,000
character later on all right and M&Z but since I'm allowing the second tweet

1285
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:33,800
tonight says this should be the game for the sweet off the Swedish Armed Forces

1286
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:36,300
the team test remember we were talking about the sweet off with one of our

1287
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:40,960
callers last week well there's this I've never even heard of this we just got a

1288
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:46,200
link here to the Swedish Armed Forces team test and I guess it's some type of

1289
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:50,080
like online little ranking thing I'll have to look into this and see if it's

1290
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:52,960
appropriate for the sweet off but I don't know like part of me is like the

1291
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:57,720
sweet off should happen with like president cat or beat mania 2dx or

1292
01:41:57,720 --> 01:42:02,800
something a little more showish or olr match game I think I think we have to do

1293
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:06,160
all our match game for the sweet off I think that's that's just mandatory but I

1294
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:10,040
appreciate the suggestion don't get me wrong tiger claw links us I'm sorry it's

1295
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:14,880
actually tiger call 305 on Twitter links us to a story on one up about ensemble

1296
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:18,080
and pandemic talking about their company closures they're actually taking

1297
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:22,400
responsibility and blaming themselves according to the one-up article Paul

1298
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:26,280
Bettner he was an employee of ensemble studios for 12 years of course it was

1299
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:29,760
shut down by Microsoft in 2008 he blamed their own internal crunch

1300
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:34,040
culture saying quote the reality is that every single game we shipped took twice

1301
01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:38,360
as long as we said it was going to take and cost twice as much to make Microsoft

1302
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:41,480
as a public company they answer to their shareholders and we were simply too

1303
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:46,160
expensive kind of an interesting little article kind of um interesting to hear

1304
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:50,520
folks taking responsibility for what happened but still kind of a it's a

1305
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:53,840
rarity nowadays it is a rarity nowadays but still kind of a bummer by the way

1306
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:59,200
when the show is bad it's never my fault always Loki's that means it's never my

1307
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:05,040
fault either it's rarely notice it's sometimes but all right Nico Nico Chan

1308
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:09,640
links us to a website I think this might be a I think this might be a website

1309
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:13,120
plug I don't know but I'll read it Pokemon ro dotnet what do you think

1310
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:17,720
about it it's like red blue made from Ragnarok online system and skills but

1311
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:22,360
with a ton of customs Jamie apparently knows it yes and we'll play we'll play

1312
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:27,840
we'll play a plus plus we'll play again they're there right now right now I

1313
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:34,080
hardly have time to play anything but this I will when I when my brain works

1314
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:38,040
and I have time gonna make some time gonna make some time in between killing

1315
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:44,240
the Klingons and Gorn spazzinator PSN says okay since it's pie day here's a

1316
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:48,920
random question pizza or pasta Boston cream see I get what he's doing there

1317
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:52,680
because they call it pizza they don't really call it pizza pie here at least I

1318
01:43:52,680 --> 01:43:59,720
never hear that term but yeah I think it's less deep dish here yeah I do love

1319
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:04,160
Boston cream pies but it's like I'll still always have pumpkins so I've got

1320
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:09,560
to go for pizza like if you're asking me one pie versus all of pizza those more

1321
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:15,860
of a cake I mean really it's it's it's a cake with a cream layer in it but you

1322
01:44:15,860 --> 01:44:20,360
still elect Boston cream over pizza no I really love Boston cream pie I had it

1323
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:26,880
for breakfast last week let's say let's see Ryan Belknap is wishing us a happy

1324
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:30,320
pie day but he's also trying to imitate a spammer I see what you're doing there

1325
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:36,160
he's a Twitter folks it's SSJ 100 Matt on Twitter but his Twitter name is Matt

1326
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:41,080
Ostrovsky which I always mispronounce dr. love himself Gene Simmons will be

1327
01:44:41,080 --> 01:44:45,640
voicing Guitar Hero 6 could it be Guitar Hero kiss awesome how this missed the

1328
01:44:45,640 --> 01:44:48,440
show world tonight but I remember reading about this apparently Gene

1329
01:44:48,440 --> 01:44:51,680
Simmons has said he's doing Guitar Hero but Gene Simmons also one of those guys

1330
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:55,760
that I get the feeling might batter off about something what he really doesn't

1331
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:59,120
know what he's talking about so like he might be saying he's doing Guitar Hero

1332
01:44:59,120 --> 01:45:02,160
six but I totally see like maybe there's a kiss Guitar Hero game in the works

1333
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:07,040
it's not actually I could see him being the voice of Guitar Hero just because he

1334
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:11,440
said he's the voice of Guitar Hero but here's the thing is he's also the voice

1335
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:18,160
of I need to get paid because you know we're not putting out any new albums and

1336
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:22,600
we are doing touring sometimes but you know what he's been on Celebrity

1337
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:29,080
Apprentice he's had his own reality show he's you know he's horned himself out

1338
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:32,920
okay that's really what it comes down to and and he was on the Celebrity

1339
01:45:32,920 --> 01:45:36,280
Apprentice for heaven's sakes I mean that's that's where celebrities go and

1340
01:45:36,280 --> 01:45:39,360
because they need attention and you know what cool he can be in the next Guitar

1341
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:43,000
Hero game just don't be pissed off if he's singing Kelly Clarkson can't wait

1342
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:47,680
can't wait for the youtubes of Gene Simmons singing Taylor Swift you belong

1343
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:56,480
to me anyhow uh that was my Taylor Swift impression by the way or Lady Gaga or

1344
01:45:56,480 --> 01:46:06,120
something can't wait the full in the full makeup you belong to me yes Taylor

1345
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:11,240
Swift sings like a muppet um lastly on the OLR Twitter brick tone asks us and I

1346
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:14,640
this is kind of a fragmented question apparently he was challenged with 140

1347
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:19,560
characters support for ps3 crash question mark well I don't support the

1348
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:26,320
ps3 crash but you know mistakes happen I put it kind of on the same level as the

1349
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:31,320
Red Ring of Death it's unnecessary Ubisoft online PC copy protection and

1350
01:46:31,320 --> 01:46:34,680
what do you think of the wiimote for ps3 well we talked about the PC thing a

1351
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:38,080
little earlier and go listen to last week's show this way I wish the Red

1352
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:42,240
Ring of Death was exactly like the PlayStation Network fail or the ps3

1353
01:46:42,240 --> 01:46:46,160
failures because if the Red Ring of Death would just go away after a day I

1354
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:50,120
wouldn't be complaining as much of it oh well that's an inconvenience but I'll

1355
01:46:50,120 --> 01:46:55,920
just wait 24 hours and it'll be all better no that's not the case it happens

1356
01:46:55,920 --> 01:47:00,320
to all the consoles that's true I don't go after a day I would rather have the

1357
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:04,560
24 hour shutdown than the you know permanent shutdown and lastly what do

1358
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:06,920
you think of the wiimote for ps3 well again I think we talked about that a

1359
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:10,160
little bit earlier in the show I think it's a necessary step for Sony but it's

1360
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:13,640
an unnecessary peripheral for me to buy right now that's where I'm at until I

1361
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:19,100
see that must-have game I'm not sold and I don't know what that must-have game is

1362
01:47:19,100 --> 01:47:23,240
but it's not like Sony can't create a new IP because like little big planet

1363
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:28,720
hello that is like a system seller ps3 game is that good you know uncharted is

1364
01:47:28,720 --> 01:47:32,840
that good speaking of little big plant you did you see the video of like how

1365
01:47:32,840 --> 01:47:38,120
exactly the PlayStation move works in I'm gonna be honest no I just heard it

1366
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:43,600
is compatible did it look good no it's basically you know how in Super Mario

1367
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:46,840
Galaxy the other players control like a curse or whatever and they could shoot

1368
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:53,960
shit no this one you basically control a cursor and you can move shit well yeah

1369
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:57,880
it might add another element to level design and I'm all for it you know again

1370
01:47:57,880 --> 01:48:02,520
where I give major major props to media molecule and Sony is that they're not

1371
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:07,280
milking little big planet for a two and three and four they keep making the

1372
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:11,960
first game better and making it so much more of a value so it's hard to be mad

1373
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:16,040
yeah you know what it's another feature it's just one I probably I'd like to

1374
01:48:16,040 --> 01:48:20,680
think of it as a continuous of all continuously evolving experience God I

1375
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:24,040
wish games were like and you know what I think that they could do a little big

1376
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:28,600
planet too but just release as a download pack look new levels that do

1377
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:33,000
you think maybe just ModNation racers will probably have it too at some point

1378
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:36,760
just wasn't ready to show yet like gripping the steering wheel wheel with

1379
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:42,840
your you know not wiimote you know I'm sure it's an inevitable thanks for the

1380
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:46,800
tweets guys twitter.com slash olr give us a follow we really appreciate it and

1381
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:50,160
by the way I also wanted to say this at some point in the show tonight we really

1382
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:54,180
do appreciate five-star reviews on iTunes and people that help spread the

1383
01:48:54,180 --> 01:48:57,920
word because you know we do say at the end of every show you know tell a friend

1384
01:48:57,920 --> 01:49:00,720
or two about the show and help spread the word about orange launch radio

1385
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:04,800
that's really all we ask to continue doing this show for you guys and I just

1386
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:08,920
want to say there were a couple of really really nice reviews left on

1387
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:12,480
iTunes this week I wanted to read them because they were very very nice and

1388
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:17,120
with last week's show even with last week's show these were both left in the

1389
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:21,640
past week for a short and sweet one from Bert 777 saying I love it been listening

1390
01:49:21,640 --> 01:49:25,120
for a while anybody into video games give these awesome people a chance so

1391
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:29,400
thank you Bert hope Ernie's doing well and but I want to read this one this is

1392
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:33,360
just sweet this this gave me the awe feeling and and really makes doing the

1393
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:37,040
show worthwhile shadow seven seven says I've been listening to OLR for at least

1394
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:40,720
three years and over time they went from being a good podcast to an epic podcast

1395
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:44,040
they are opinionated and well-informed on video game matters and to top it off

1396
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:47,120
for really funny over time they have honed their broadcasting skills and

1397
01:49:47,120 --> 01:49:50,160
their radio voices and have become a podcast that I would actually pay money

1398
01:49:50,160 --> 01:49:54,520
to hear they do go off on tangents quite often though choo-choo this is a plus to

1399
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:58,040
me but always managed to wrap something up about video games into the subject

1400
01:49:58,040 --> 01:50:01,000
they are always current about the video game industry and run the gamut on

1401
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:05,960
topics from reviews to previews to info on various video game developers and

1402
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:09,280
publishers to things random to describe the live show is something new

1403
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:11,720
experience and they actually pay attention to the chat room and take

1404
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:15,240
calls the community is also fairly active so I just want to say thank you

1405
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:19,000
because you know people take the time out to write these nice reviews and I

1406
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,720
realize yeah it's a little bit of ego stroking and so forth but I actually

1407
01:50:21,720 --> 01:50:25,320
read that it made me go oh that's really nice like somebody didn't have to say

1408
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:30,600
all that and they did and I just wanted to share the the odds so thank you very

1409
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:35,080
much again those are five-star reviews from iTunes and of course you know all

1410
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:38,960
we ask I realize not everybody's on the Apple bandwagon like if I asked Loki to

1411
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:41,960
leave a five-star review on iTunes he told me to play hide and go fuck myself

1412
01:50:41,960 --> 01:50:46,120
from last week's show so it just tell friends about the show that's all we I

1413
01:50:46,120 --> 01:50:50,000
don't go on iTunes I know you don't you know that's against you can rate them on

1414
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:56,600
zoom to just you know all right anyhow let's move on some actual video gaming

1415
01:50:56,600 --> 01:51:00,360
news let's get past the ego stroking and get to some more video game news

1416
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:05,680
because there's plenty of it still to go more stuff coming out from you know this

1417
01:51:05,680 --> 01:51:10,760
week there's actually some information you know we talked a little about in the

1418
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:18,080
tall and whatnot but can't forget about XNA XNA game studio 4.0 apparently is

1419
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:24,960
including support for Windows phones and they're even going to be including some

1420
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:31,360
new features including gamer tags avatar support and achievements you can unlock

1421
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:37,200
on your phone that's right there's going to be games that you can use for

1422
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:42,280
unlocking achievements kind of like an Xbox Live arcade game in fact you can

1423
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:50,080
unlock up to 200 Microsoft or gamerscore points and I guess it's going to be

1424
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:56,440
displayed on your Xbox Live gamer tag profile like the games for Windows stuff

1425
01:51:56,440 --> 01:52:01,080
because there was that one game tinker was it called that you can only get on

1426
01:52:01,080 --> 01:52:03,400
the windows thing it was like the free game that came with the games for

1427
01:52:03,400 --> 01:52:06,440
Windows client and you could play that game I reviewed it about a month ago I

1428
01:52:06,440 --> 01:52:09,000
think it was called tinker and it would show up in your profile just like any

1429
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,720
older the game and it had its own set of achievement points so it's kind of like

1430
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:16,280
that but now on your cell phone yeah and it's kind of neat I think that's a cool

1431
01:52:16,280 --> 01:52:20,200
idea you know for you know how Apple should have done it achievement whores

1432
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:25,840
they well you know sometimes achievements like that it gets people

1433
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:28,960
to buy the game well there's a whole study out of GDC again it's not on the

1434
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:32,360
show tonight but there's a whole thing on achievements and it does motivate

1435
01:52:32,360 --> 01:52:36,000
people to play games and there's a percentage of people it's a small

1436
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,360
percentage but a percentage that really try to go after every single achievement

1437
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:43,280
in a game you know and and we'll buy games with a chief didn't they say to

1438
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:48,400
that games with really easy achievements especially in arcade will sell a little

1439
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:54,640
more times me so hey why not if it's a way to draw attention to the windows

1440
01:52:54,640 --> 01:52:58,560
phone anything to pull the eyes away from Apple for a minute I I think is a

1441
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:04,280
good idea mm-hmm all right with this would this get you on board with a

1442
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:07,360
windows phone though Loki since I know you're not gonna get an iPhone no because

1443
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:11,360
the data plans on phones are too expensive and it's just you know if they

1444
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:15,960
brought down if it was like 50 bucks a month for unlimited data and everything

1445
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:19,640
then maybe because that's what I kind of pay for my phone right now but even then

1446
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:22,760
I don't use that many minutes right now and I'm actually thinking about going to

1447
01:53:22,760 --> 01:53:27,400
a prepaid phones where I don't have to you know like 100 bucks a year type

1448
01:53:27,400 --> 01:53:35,440
stuff you know we're literally I'm lucky if I use six to twelve minutes a month

1449
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:40,160
well somebody is teasing me yet again with the idea of a new Kid Icarus game

1450
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:43,220
remember about a year or two ago where we were convinced this was coming out at

1451
01:53:43,220 --> 01:53:46,880
e3 we had the screenshots and everything and it just didn't fucking happen how

1452
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:52,040
sad well again we get teased and you can kind of thank Kotaku for that but really

1453
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:55,640
it was because they were interviewing Yoshio Sakamoto who of course was one of

1454
01:53:55,640 --> 01:54:00,200
the creators of Kid Icarus I guess they cornered him at GDC or something and

1455
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:03,600
basically he said in a nutshell that you know they're not opposed to bringing out

1456
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:06,880
Kid Icarus to the Wii they just don't know what to do here's the quote quote I

1457
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:11,520
don't know personally about any project underway regarding Kid Icarus but if so

1458
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:14,320
many of these people are interested in it and really want to see it on the Wii

1459
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:20,280
they should really speak up are they deaf because I think like a lot of

1460
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:23,560
people have been like speaking up for a while but okay whatever well are we do

1461
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:28,360
we need to do a petition online is that what needs to happen good gosh I'm sure

1462
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:33,360
there's plenty already again moving on with a quote quote if we can find some

1463
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:37,320
sort of way to bring it to the Wii a way to make the game for the Wii that makes

1464
01:54:37,320 --> 01:54:42,000
sense we would happily do so but just keep in mind it may not be me making the

1465
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:45,720
game so in other words he's admitting it might be somebody else just like how

1466
01:54:45,720 --> 01:54:49,680
Metroid other M is is in somebody else's hands and so forth honestly I think if

1467
01:54:49,680 --> 01:54:52,600
they want to do a Kid Icarus game on the Wii why not just do like a souped up

1468
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:57,460
version Allah even though even I hate to say it because I received this game so

1469
01:54:57,460 --> 01:55:01,160
tepidly but maybe the blaster master game just a little more polished or the

1470
01:55:01,160 --> 01:55:05,320
just like the Mario new Super Mario Brothers Wii you don't have to like

1471
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:11,200
totally reinvent Kid Icarus just you know make it a fancy looking 2d game

1472
01:55:11,200 --> 01:55:17,440
with some new features that's all you really need to do I think but all right

1473
01:55:17,440 --> 01:55:21,440
I just hate the idea that's getting teased on that again because I would

1474
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:24,800
really love to see a Kid Icarus but again I want to see him do it right I

1475
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:27,600
don't want to see him just slap something with the character his name on

1476
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:31,480
it and it sucks so I rather they just don't touch it at all and I'm sure a lot

1477
01:55:31,480 --> 01:55:34,860
of you guys feel the same way anyhow dark soccer what you got I want the most

1478
01:55:34,860 --> 01:55:40,120
epic Kid Icarus ever I do too I you know and especially you would think with God

1479
01:55:40,120 --> 01:55:44,400
of War which is another Greek mythology thing doing very well on another

1480
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:48,120
platform you think Nintendo would would already have some ideas on how you can

1481
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:51,760
make the Greek mythology thing successful I know how about Battle of

1482
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:57,240
Olympus anyone well how about something else though that is kind of a big ish

1483
01:55:57,240 --> 01:56:07,560
okay Hanabi festival yay but Nintendo raised some prices for some of their

1484
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:12,680
games ironclad is now a thousand we points instead of 900 and loadrunner is

1485
01:56:12,680 --> 01:56:20,000
600 instead of 500 there's military madness for we wear which will be a

1486
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:26,600
thousand we points and then the rest is DSI where pop island simply mahjong

1487
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:36,160
simply sudoku each of those will be 200 DSI points and then four travelers play

1488
01:56:36,160 --> 01:56:40,480
Spanish which is a multiplayer game that teaches you Spanish and elementary

1489
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:50,320
masters being a fantasy card adventure both are 800 DSI points so they got a

1490
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:53,920
lot of the big stuff out last year but of course Rondo of blood is kind of the

1491
01:56:53,920 --> 01:56:58,840
big one that everybody's like that means I don't have to worry about

1492
01:56:58,840 --> 01:57:01,920
accidentally scratching my desk I wonder if that means it's gonna come out here

1493
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:05,160
too oh I know you're reading it for Europe and what they get but they

1494
01:57:05,160 --> 01:57:08,400
sometimes get cooler stuff than we do so I hope it means we're gonna get it

1495
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:14,240
around the same time want it might be dark sakura it could be tomorrow it

1496
01:57:14,240 --> 01:57:20,560
could be tomorrow I know I know I want next week to be here already not just

1497
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:23,360
because of packs not not this coming week but the week after not just because

1498
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:26,920
the PAX East but Microsoft Game Room I've seen some of the clips from my GDC

1499
01:57:26,920 --> 01:57:30,680
for Microsoft Game Room looks looks kind of cool I'm excited to try here's my

1500
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:34,040
question though about that hobby festival those just because you guys

1501
01:57:34,040 --> 01:57:38,280
are getting all excited and everything one of the years they did bring that

1502
01:57:38,280 --> 01:57:43,720
stuff over here but not last year I don't think it was only in Europe well

1503
01:57:43,720 --> 01:57:47,620
it seems like they don't bring all the games over here cuz well no I guess they

1504
01:57:47,620 --> 01:57:51,800
did do a festival out of it because I want to say they brought sin and

1505
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:54,960
punishment over here which was a big deal because they in the back of their

1506
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:58,740
minds they knew the sequel was coming we didn't know that yet but they knew it

1507
01:57:58,740 --> 01:58:05,560
was so they brought that out yeah I think marbles too did also like yeah I

1508
01:58:05,560 --> 01:58:09,240
think you're right the original Mario 2 you're right yeah was part of that

1509
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:14,400
crap well maybe they'll do it again here but not gonna hold my breath either so

1510
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:17,200
we'll see a couple more stories for you guys then we're gonna get to the mailbag

1511
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:22,960
mailbag at orange lounge radio.com well this is kind of an interesting tie-in

1512
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:29,480
but apparently mafia 2 will feature vintage playboys that's right 2k games

1513
01:58:29,480 --> 01:58:32,440
has announced that they've signed a license agreement with the Playboy

1514
01:58:32,440 --> 01:58:40,400
magazine for I guess they're gonna have 50 of the vintage covers and centerfolds

1515
01:58:40,400 --> 01:58:44,440
inside the game when it's released so I guess you'll see vintage playboys

1516
01:58:44,440 --> 01:58:51,000
littered on the ground and stuff like that also I guess you know the Playboy

1517
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:55,960
collectibles won't show up I guess until the later part of the game because I

1518
01:58:55,960 --> 01:59:02,520
guess the game takes place during the 40s and 50s and apparently the magazine

1519
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:08,040
won't I guess merely be like a window dressing they're saying but I actually

1520
01:59:08,040 --> 01:59:12,720
have the ability to collect virtual copies of the magazine so that's a

1521
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:18,160
Pokemon game worth playing so I guess you know like in the Grand Theft Auto

1522
01:59:18,160 --> 01:59:21,960
games where you have hidden packages or in you know Grand Theft Auto 4 birds you have to

1523
01:59:21,960 --> 01:59:28,160
kill this game you will have dirty magazines that you collect nice and

1524
01:59:28,160 --> 01:59:32,680
they're that are they actual Playboy vintage covers that's gonna be the

1525
01:59:32,680 --> 01:59:37,240
actual covers Wow so they're gonna I don't know if they have it says they

1526
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:39,800
have the centerfolds as well so I don't know if you get the cover in the

1527
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:45,720
centerfold it's a little bit of nudity for you but uh neat hey adding some tits

1528
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:48,640
to your game always makes it sell a few more copies so there you go and I do

1529
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:53,880
believe that they had a character from mafia 2 in the last digital fake game

1530
01:59:53,880 --> 01:59:58,640
chick oh they still do that huh yeah these girls and it's retarded yeah a

1531
01:59:58,640 --> 02:00:05,240
little silly all right on the PSP maybe this system can render some nice-looking

1532
02:00:05,240 --> 02:00:09,120
titties I don't know that should be the question we ask about a new engine you

1533
02:00:09,120 --> 02:00:12,480
know how we always say with a new peripheral what's the time to penis with

1534
02:00:12,480 --> 02:00:15,680
new game engines we should always ask what's the time for realistic boobs I

1535
02:00:15,680 --> 02:00:20,280
don't know anyhow I think this system is very capable of doing it it's the fire

1536
02:00:20,280 --> 02:00:26,080
engine that's phyre engine right now this is a tool that's used for creating

1537
02:00:26,080 --> 02:00:31,080
ps3 games it was used to make critter crunch flower shatter well apparently

1538
02:00:31,080 --> 02:00:35,280
now this is going to be compatible with the PSP big announcement a game

1539
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:38,440
developers conference which makes sense because the people developing games want

1540
02:00:38,440 --> 02:00:41,200
to know that they can make games like critter crunch on the PSP I gotta say

1541
02:00:41,200 --> 02:00:45,760
flower awesome-looking game that is one of the most beautiful games you will

1542
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:50,560
play on a next-gen system period critter crunch looks like a freaking cartoon

1543
02:00:50,560 --> 02:00:53,760
really well done so it's kind of exciting to hear that this phyre engine

1544
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:59,760
is coming to the PSP one of the VPS technology taji you kata or sorry you

1545
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:03,720
taka said phyre engine for PSP was developed in response to requests from

1546
02:01:03,720 --> 02:01:07,200
the game developer community and we hope that the release of the PSP version

1547
02:01:07,200 --> 02:01:11,280
demonstrates our commitment and support for game developers on all platforms

1548
02:01:11,280 --> 02:01:16,040
begin counting down the time until critter crunch and flower are announced

1549
02:01:16,040 --> 02:01:20,400
on the PSP because I'll bet you anything both of those games being as well

1550
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:25,920
received as they were getting PSP ports in a matter of three two one yeah wait

1551
02:01:25,920 --> 02:01:31,720
for e3 anyhow now is the part of the show where dark soccer is gonna take an

1552
02:01:31,720 --> 02:01:35,120
adventure into the mailbag she's gonna jump in pull out some emails and read

1553
02:01:35,120 --> 02:01:42,720
them for you here the mailbag mailbag at orange lounge radio.com dark soccer who's

1554
02:01:42,720 --> 02:01:48,560
emailing us this week two from Rob above this is now that the following terms are

1555
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:52,600
allowed in Xbox Live gamer tags lesbian gay bi transgender straight I think that

1556
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:57,000
Microsoft has the golden opportunity for avatar clothing and props of the LGBT

1557
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:02,200
it's not an official 2010 prediction but I'm pretty sure they will any takers or

1558
02:02:02,200 --> 02:02:06,080
am I taking too much for granted in other news did you hear about Washington

1559
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:09,520
DC has made gay marriage legal next thing you know some guy will try to

1560
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:15,400
marry his virtual girlfriend oh wait yes I I did hear about DC making it legal so

1561
02:02:15,400 --> 02:02:19,600
congratulations DC and I may I made a mistake because I tweeted about it when

1562
02:02:19,600 --> 02:02:23,360
it happens and I was like what state's gonna be next come on guys it's time to

1563
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:26,320
get the other states on board and then I realized like literally five seconds

1564
02:02:26,320 --> 02:02:31,440
after hitting submit I was like oh DC is not a state but still it's it's an

1565
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:35,800
important part of the nation obviously and very glad to hear that they have

1566
02:02:35,800 --> 02:02:40,640
stopped marriage discrimination yep good for them as far as the other part of

1567
02:02:40,640 --> 02:02:44,400
that the the part related to gaming more about how long before I can get a rainbow

1568
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:49,480
sticker a rainbow belt for my character I don't know I think a lot of it is

1569
02:02:49,480 --> 02:02:53,960
about supply and demand and I don't know if there's just a huge demand for that I

1570
02:02:53,960 --> 02:02:57,680
don't think that Microsoft's gonna be really trying to sell that anytime soon

1571
02:02:57,680 --> 02:03:01,040
I don't know I think it would be a little while I just don't think there's

1572
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:05,560
enough out there in the avatar marketplace where they need that stuff

1573
02:03:05,560 --> 02:03:09,800
right now I mean yeah they have sports jerseys but you know I don't know I

1574
02:03:09,800 --> 02:03:14,160
don't then again they had the politically motivated icons a couple

1575
02:03:14,160 --> 02:03:17,760
years ago when the oh eight election happened I want to say they had their

1576
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:22,480
own little like Xbox poll because there were Obama icons and McCain icons right

1577
02:03:22,480 --> 02:03:26,520
am I crazy when there's some type of like unscientific poll they did like

1578
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:31,880
yeah I don't know I don't know if they'd want to do such a social issue on the

1579
02:03:31,880 --> 02:03:37,800
marketplace I don't realistically see that happening well now also from the

1580
02:03:37,800 --> 02:03:44,000
Disney parks log the monorails are going to feature Tron legacy art okay that's

1581
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:48,720
pretty cool nice like all the Disney parks are gonna be Tron Trana time

1582
02:03:48,720 --> 02:03:53,680
trying to tie looking at the Disney parks it's the it's Disney world oh wow

1583
02:03:53,680 --> 02:03:58,320
that's so cool you see the monorails at Disneyland like just got redone not that

1584
02:03:58,320 --> 02:04:01,920
long ago so I'm but I can't believe tell me this picture is not sweet oh that's

1585
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:04,760
right oh it's just like a little paint job on the outside yeah pretty cool

1586
02:04:04,760 --> 02:04:09,320
though um yes me you know what I mean even cooler if they did

1587
02:04:09,320 --> 02:04:15,760
we know be boy no but seriously though speaking of Tron in Disneyland because I

1588
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:19,800
can bring this back on point the coolest fucking ride I remember from when I was

1589
02:04:19,800 --> 02:04:25,080
a kid the people mover featuring Tron it was you know they had the people mover

1590
02:04:25,080 --> 02:04:27,800
which I had for years and years but in the early 80s when the movie came out

1591
02:04:27,800 --> 02:04:31,840
there was a section of it that was the super speed tunnel where basically they

1592
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:36,320
projected imageries of Tron really fast on the wall so if it was a visual trick

1593
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:39,200
it was an optical illusion that made you feel like you were going like 60 miles

1594
02:04:39,200 --> 02:04:42,600
an hour in this tunnel because it was like the light cycles going by real

1595
02:04:42,600 --> 02:04:47,840
quick like bring that back Disneyland the fucking tracks are still sitting

1596
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:53,600
there not being used how awesome would it be if this Christmas you open it up

1597
02:04:53,600 --> 02:04:59,200
for Tron problem is the people mover someone fell off of it and died then

1598
02:04:59,200 --> 02:05:03,400
they their own damn fault and then they I understand yes and I totally agree

1599
02:05:03,400 --> 02:05:06,880
with you it is their own damn fault that they fell out of the stupid thing and

1600
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:11,960
died then there was the rocket rods which were really super fast still had

1601
02:05:11,960 --> 02:05:15,920
the Tron tunnel but it was like zoom through the Tron tunnel it is hard to

1602
02:05:15,920 --> 02:05:22,440
see anything I never rode rocket rods sadly but someone also somehow managed

1603
02:05:22,440 --> 02:05:28,000
to fall out of that thing and died so people are dumb that's what it comes

1604
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:31,040
down to that's why they all the gondolas anymore because someone fell out of it

1605
02:05:31,040 --> 02:05:36,600
and died it's always people acting like jackasses falling out of things and

1606
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:41,840
dying the chat room has a request for me real quick here honors like a genuine

1607
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:47,080
bona fide electrified six-car monorail what I say monorail what's it called

1608
02:05:47,080 --> 02:05:55,440
that's right monorail I hear those things are awfully loud it lies as

1609
02:05:55,440 --> 02:05:59,880
softly as a cloud is there a chance the truck could bend not on your life my

1610
02:05:59,880 --> 02:06:05,200
Hindu friend what about a spring that slobs you'll be given cushy jobs where

1611
02:06:05,200 --> 02:06:09,960
you sent here by the devil no good sir I'm on the level the ring came off my

1612
02:06:09,960 --> 02:06:14,760
pudding can take my penknife my good man I swear it's Springfield's only choice

1613
02:06:14,760 --> 02:06:18,600
throw up your hands and raise your voice

1614
02:06:24,200 --> 02:06:31,200
but main streets the wall cracked and broken sorry mom the mob is spoken

1615
02:06:31,200 --> 02:06:48,200
Phil Hartman was a great man he's missed all right anyhow sorry for the tangent

1616
02:06:48,200 --> 02:06:55,960
yes hopefully they involve monorails good morning orange house radio this is

1617
02:06:55,960 --> 02:06:59,880
Jesus writing in again I have quite a few things to cover today so first I'd

1618
02:06:59,880 --> 02:07:02,600
like to thank dark soccer for reading my previous selling email in this one as

1619
02:07:02,600 --> 02:07:05,920
well I really appreciate it I am also sorry for any spelling errors or

1620
02:07:05,920 --> 02:07:09,200
grammatical faults in my letters which there are undoubtedly many yeah but

1621
02:07:09,200 --> 02:07:11,880
you're forgiven now on to more pressing matters

1622
02:07:11,880 --> 02:07:18,120
okay ripper is the Swede I should be the other Swede since I am still just a

1623
02:07:18,120 --> 02:07:23,280
private in the ol army oh don't give up like that come on where's my epic battle

1624
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:29,080
where's my sweet throw down okay fine a lot of respect goes out to a key

1625
02:07:29,080 --> 02:07:32,640
ripper his ability to call in so often I'm still quite impressed he manages to

1626
02:07:32,640 --> 02:07:37,480
stay up for so long every week anyways time for something that actually relates

1627
02:07:37,480 --> 02:07:42,360
to gaming as we all know the world is in a state of economic turmoil hundreds and

1628
02:07:42,360 --> 02:07:46,440
thousands of developers are being fired studios are getting shut down and the

1629
02:07:46,440 --> 02:07:50,040
debate of piracy and DRM is getting more attention around the globe as we've

1630
02:07:50,040 --> 02:07:55,560
heard on the last few shows but how is this impact impacting the gaming world

1631
02:07:55,560 --> 02:08:00,600
on a larger scale I'll tell you how more sequels than ever are being pumped out

1632
02:08:00,600 --> 02:08:03,440
in fear of bankruptcy and less money is being invested in creating new

1633
02:08:03,440 --> 02:08:07,080
intellectual properties the reasoning is very simple and is often employed in the

1634
02:08:07,080 --> 02:08:10,960
movie business using a successful brand name or franchise that is already well

1635
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:14,720
known will cost the publisher a lot less money to build up interest and then

1636
02:08:14,720 --> 02:08:18,500
having to actually produce several ads and build a hype behind a new setting

1637
02:08:18,500 --> 02:08:23,120
and new characters successful games usually have an amount of blind

1638
02:08:23,120 --> 02:08:26,960
followers who will buy the next game in a series if the previous game was good

1639
02:08:26,960 --> 02:08:30,720
which in turn means almost guaranteed turnover of all investments and profits

1640
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:34,800
for the publisher to prove my point I want each OLR member to try and think of

1641
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:41,760
the game that is near release that is based on a new IP now that might not

1642
02:08:41,760 --> 02:08:45,560
have been too hard since you have had the new releases segments before mailbag

1643
02:08:45,560 --> 02:08:51,280
but my point is that a large percentage of new games have to have a two or three

1644
02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:55,800
in the name when will we get the next portal or Bioshock type of game that

1645
02:08:55,800 --> 02:09:00,600
comes along and really blows people's minds one portal to talk to I know right

1646
02:09:00,600 --> 02:09:04,840
what made both of those games so amazing was that there was no expectation of

1647
02:09:04,840 --> 02:09:07,800
what the games would be about the storytelling and both these were

1648
02:09:07,800 --> 02:09:12,320
innovated the protagonist intriguing in the setting unique which really made for

1649
02:09:12,320 --> 02:09:16,680
a game experience like no other with this in mind isn't it sad that there is

1650
02:09:16,680 --> 02:09:21,160
a Bioshock 2 already out in that portal 2 is on its way how we really reached

1651
02:09:21,160 --> 02:09:26,200
solo that any new franchise gets 80 or more Metacritic score gets placed on the

1652
02:09:26,200 --> 02:09:30,440
sequel bandwagon is this really what us gamers want I will have to say I am

1653
02:09:30,440 --> 02:09:35,480
excited about portal 2 I guess I'm just point though yeah well I know I get the

1654
02:09:35,480 --> 02:09:40,400
point but I do want more portal goodness I think though that some of us are just

1655
02:09:40,400 --> 02:09:44,600
like we have such awesome experiences with some of these games that we want

1656
02:09:44,600 --> 02:09:48,800
more it's a matter of whether they need to make the sequel or not like some

1657
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:53,120
sequels are actually pretty good and some sequels are just kind of we put it

1658
02:09:53,120 --> 02:09:56,320
out because we want more money I have been hearing the most friendly feedback

1659
02:09:56,320 --> 02:10:00,200
regarding Bioshock 2 that a lot of folks are complaining it does feel like a cash

1660
02:10:00,200 --> 02:10:04,280
cow at the first game Bioshock was great but there have been some really good

1661
02:10:04,280 --> 02:10:08,600
original game a little big plan I was talking about earlier Bayonetta Bayonetta

1662
02:10:08,600 --> 02:10:11,600
was really well or the original Mass Effect I'm saying for sequels though oh

1663
02:10:11,600 --> 02:10:14,900
but I mean even original IPs there's been a lot of really good ones in the

1664
02:10:14,900 --> 02:10:19,280
past year blur looks like it's gonna be great you know there there's some

1665
02:10:19,280 --> 02:10:26,720
second to to finish email out I guess I'm just ranting at this point so I will

1666
02:10:26,720 --> 02:10:30,140
ask another question regarding new IPs when do you think Blizzard will release

1667
02:10:30,140 --> 02:10:35,160
a game with a new IP soon I think they're working on one right now I think

1668
02:10:35,160 --> 02:10:39,440
I I don't know maybe I'm putting the cart before a horse a little bit but I

1669
02:10:39,440 --> 02:10:42,520
remember there were some rumors a while back that they were working on a new IP

1670
02:10:42,520 --> 02:10:48,200
because they had Diablo Starcraft World of Warcraft and then another one I think

1671
02:10:48,200 --> 02:10:52,760
once you see the spacecraft I think once you see the dust settle with

1672
02:10:52,760 --> 02:10:58,940
Star Trek Star Trek Starcraft and the World of Warcraft cataclysm and you know

1673
02:10:58,940 --> 02:11:03,160
Diablo 3 is kind of their focus I think you'll start to get some rumblings of

1674
02:11:03,160 --> 02:11:08,440
what they're doing next and I my gut tells me it's gonna be an MMO and I'll

1675
02:11:08,440 --> 02:11:12,080
go so far to say it's an MMO but not like a Warcraft MMO like something

1676
02:11:12,080 --> 02:11:17,160
kind of different like a tabula rasa MMO you know how tabula rasa was like a

1677
02:11:17,160 --> 02:11:21,120
shooter like I think they're gonna go a different route with the MMO why make a

1678
02:11:21,120 --> 02:11:24,560
copy of Warcraft when they have Warcraft I think they're gonna go with an MMO

1679
02:11:24,560 --> 02:11:32,840
that's different and that makes sense well um okay looking forward to to the

1680
02:11:32,840 --> 02:11:36,480
show and your response is Jesus PS I will most likely be listening live to

1681
02:11:36,480 --> 02:11:42,000
the next olr the one on March 21st call us yeah we need maybe we should have

1682
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,680
our match came off that week I don't know we'll see we maybe I could plan a

1683
02:11:44,680 --> 02:11:48,160
match game oh you're not gonna be here next no I'll be here I'll be late oh

1684
02:11:48,160 --> 02:11:52,360
you'll be late okay I'm gonna go to a Seder okay so well then what time do you

1685
02:11:52,360 --> 02:11:56,600
get back from those about seven eight maybe earlier all right cool then we

1686
02:11:56,600 --> 02:12:00,800
should be able to do a match game in part B yeah hello olr okay here's the

1687
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:03,760
deal about a month ago I wrote in about Silent Hill shattered memories in Dark

1688
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:08,560
Sakura the kind living woman she is I know told me flat-out to play one of the

1689
02:12:08,560 --> 02:12:12,720
originals now I'm getting to my point here I bought Silent Hill 2 just a

1690
02:12:12,720 --> 02:12:17,560
couple of days ago but I could have gotten a Silent Hill for the room so I

1691
02:12:17,560 --> 02:12:20,560
was wondering did I pass up a great game for a load of crap are they both equally

1692
02:12:20,560 --> 02:12:24,280
good and should I just shut the hell up now um they're different kinds of good

1693
02:12:24,280 --> 02:12:28,320
Silent Hill 4 is a very different kind of game sorry what was the other game I

1694
02:12:28,320 --> 02:12:32,720
heard the room it got Silent Hill 2 but passed up Silent Hill 4 to get it I

1695
02:12:32,720 --> 02:12:37,080
think you made the good choice I think yeah if you haven't played either I

1696
02:12:37,080 --> 02:12:40,120
think you made the better choice with two I think two is the one that's very

1697
02:12:40,120 --> 02:12:43,960
iconic of the series although a lot of folks are partial to three and the

1698
02:12:43,960 --> 02:12:49,040
original as well I personally am partial to three and I still say play two first

1699
02:12:49,040 --> 02:12:53,720
between the yeah I mean four is not bad by any means I think it got raised a

1700
02:12:53,720 --> 02:12:57,560
little bit by critics too harsh I think it's better than that but I think also

1701
02:12:57,560 --> 02:13:00,760
it's a little obvious that four was intended to be a different game in the

1702
02:13:00,760 --> 02:13:06,840
beginning yeah it because as far as how they're related three is more of a sequel

1703
02:13:06,840 --> 02:13:13,560
to one and four follow some of the story points from two well four was just gonna

1704
02:13:13,560 --> 02:13:17,500
be the room yeah it was a new horror franchise they were doing called the

1705
02:13:17,500 --> 02:13:21,040
room and they ended up you know it's kind of Silent Hill ish so let's make it

1706
02:13:21,040 --> 02:13:26,640
Silent Hill but it worked it really did work it did it it was a good game I a

1707
02:13:26,640 --> 02:13:31,060
horrible horribly underrated by the community at home the part with big head

1708
02:13:31,060 --> 02:13:35,440
good oh my god I screamed like a little girl when I played that I think Logie

1709
02:13:35,440 --> 02:13:39,120
was there and I felt I remember falling down and there were these big monster

1710
02:13:39,120 --> 02:13:42,760
two-headed baby things in the well water prison or whatever and I screamed like a

1711
02:13:42,760 --> 02:13:45,960
girl look he's what the hell are you doing like I'm playing Silent Hill and

1712
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:52,600
it's Gary um okay so yeah they're both equally good but you did a good thing by

1713
02:13:52,600 --> 02:13:57,360
buying Silent Hill 2 on another note my friend brought up a good point today

1714
02:13:57,360 --> 02:14:01,120
about Max Payne 3 which brings me to another question do you guys know

1715
02:14:01,120 --> 02:14:04,080
whether or not they're going to bring back the comic panels for cutscenes are

1716
02:14:04,080 --> 02:14:09,960
we all fucked for that well I think I don't know yeah a little little early to

1717
02:14:09,960 --> 02:14:14,640
tell honestly but hey you could always have the digital comics on PSP you never

1718
02:14:14,640 --> 02:14:18,020
know they may make a comic out of it specifically for a PSP it would

1719
02:14:18,020 --> 02:14:21,840
certainly lend itself well to that well I thank you for reading my email and if

1720
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:26,440
you didn't why the fuck not your loyal listener I'll just say I'm not gonna do

1721
02:14:26,440 --> 02:14:30,280
your whole name Haseo from northern Minnesota the land of the oh my god it's

1722
02:14:30,280 --> 02:14:34,840
so fucking windy I'm sorry muddy sorry I like listeners to get a little bit of

1723
02:14:34,840 --> 02:14:39,960
attitude with us and if you didn't read this email why the fuck no I like emails

1724
02:14:39,960 --> 02:14:46,440
to get a little sassy with us oh we got another did he text us really quick yeah

1725
02:14:46,440 --> 02:14:52,960
okay okay one more message is there a way to get memory from a ps2 I guess

1726
02:14:52,960 --> 02:14:58,620
memory card to a ps1 I can't because those are a bitch to find without going

1727
02:14:58,620 --> 02:15:07,200
online to PSP and onto a ps3 without the memory card adapter onto a ps3 no I

1728
02:15:07,200 --> 02:15:12,320
think you need the adapter if you're going from ps1 to ps2 a ps2 will read

1729
02:15:12,320 --> 02:15:18,300
the cards from one and you can even put that data on a ps2 card but only ask

1730
02:15:18,300 --> 02:15:24,360
like a carrier you can't put a ps2 card in a ps1 under any reason so the only

1731
02:15:24,360 --> 02:15:28,020
thing you could do you could put a ps1 card in a ps2 but unfortunately I ain't

1732
02:15:28,020 --> 02:15:33,000
gonna do you a lick of good without the the transmitter cable unfortunately

1733
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:38,720
that's just the way it is oopsies if you I you might be able to I don't know if

1734
02:15:38,720 --> 02:15:41,400
this will work you might have to do some research on this you might be able to

1735
02:15:41,400 --> 02:15:45,540
get something that lets you put your ps1 data on the PC and then you could use a

1736
02:15:45,540 --> 02:15:51,440
USB stick to do it that I think is possible but I can't remember yeah but

1737
02:15:51,440 --> 02:15:55,920
saves on the PC had different formats and stuff so it might not work hmm

1738
02:15:55,920 --> 02:15:59,400
because remember there's like dextra I formats and stuff I know this from back

1739
02:15:59,400 --> 02:16:04,040
in the day when I'd used to do edit heck you'll just you might have to spend the

1740
02:16:04,040 --> 02:16:08,760
money to get the cable dude sorry all right well let's get into some angst

1741
02:16:08,760 --> 02:16:12,440
sometimes there are things that happen in the world that make us angry and we

1742
02:16:12,440 --> 02:16:16,060
always do this segment every week to just just get it out of our system so we

1743
02:16:16,060 --> 02:16:38,680
can be the happy host you know I was really trying to think of one okay this

1744
02:16:38,680 --> 02:16:43,900
is gonna require some backstory and it is a little bit of family goings-on for

1745
02:16:43,900 --> 02:16:54,220
me my my brother's girlfriend and her mother were found dead on Monday in

1746
02:16:54,220 --> 02:17:01,280
Silver Hill Alabama so if anyone in the area who knows them don't you know say

1747
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:08,260
you heard anything well I mean I just it's not I guess so much of a fuck you

1748
02:17:08,260 --> 02:17:15,680
type of thing it's just more of a regrettable thing I actually have to say

1749
02:17:15,680 --> 02:17:20,800
everyone and Nina they actually don't know if it the whole theory is that it's

1750
02:17:20,800 --> 02:17:24,960
carbon monoxide poisoning what killed them in there and at the mobile home

1751
02:17:24,960 --> 02:17:31,240
they lived in because the last anyone heard anything was Friday and Matt

1752
02:17:31,240 --> 02:17:35,260
didn't find out no one found out until Monday when they found them but I'm just

1753
02:17:35,260 --> 02:17:40,960
saying there's no excuse not to have a carbon monoxide tester even if that

1754
02:17:40,960 --> 02:17:43,920
wasn't the cause that it's inconclusive right now they're treating it as a

1755
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:48,880
homicide but even so if it was carbon monoxide or some type of gas monitoring

1756
02:17:48,880 --> 02:17:52,420
or anything there really shouldn't be any excuse if there's not a way to

1757
02:17:52,420 --> 02:17:57,720
monitor that I'd say everyone your your homes and your health and your lives are

1758
02:17:57,720 --> 02:18:01,960
that important you should invest a little bit monitoring don't they sell

1759
02:18:01,960 --> 02:18:05,480
and if they don't why not smoke detectors that double as carbon monoxide

1760
02:18:05,480 --> 02:18:09,280
they do it's a good thing to have you know how they regulate smoke detectors

1761
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:14,120
in public they should be regulating the multi detectors people with smoke in the

1762
02:18:14,120 --> 02:18:20,520
house they turn off smoke detectors I know I know I know it's and you know

1763
02:18:20,520 --> 02:18:26,520
especially a lot of the manufacturing with some it was some of those mobile

1764
02:18:26,520 --> 02:18:31,400
homes are not always up to standard it's always very important that they be

1765
02:18:31,400 --> 02:18:39,480
checked out you know is I mean my brother's girlfriend she was 18 and her

1766
02:18:39,480 --> 02:18:46,200
mom was in her 50s and both way too young to you know well it's very

1767
02:18:46,200 --> 02:18:52,400
unfortunate I'm sorry to hear it yeah and and not my brother Matthew he's was

1768
02:18:52,400 --> 02:18:55,320
a bit of a mess when I talked to him but he seems to be doing better well yeah I

1769
02:18:55,320 --> 02:19:00,940
would be too so can't blame him so let that tragedy be awareness for everybody

1770
02:19:00,940 --> 02:19:04,660
it's no joke just like you know unfortunately I had a tragedy where I

1771
02:19:04,660 --> 02:19:08,500
lost someone h1n1 last year it's no joke some of these things you're about no

1801
02:21:44,920 --> 02:21:49,320
um my f you I'll try to keep a brief I I've had to make a very tough decision

1802
02:21:49,320 --> 02:21:53,880
over the weekend and so you know like with any decision you have those two

1803
02:21:53,880 --> 02:21:56,760
guys that sit on your shoulder not necessarily the angel and the devil but

1804
02:21:56,760 --> 02:22:00,800
the you know advocate and for one side the advocate for other that yell and

1805
02:22:00,800 --> 02:22:04,760
argue back and forth so although I'm fairly confident in this decision I'm

1806
02:22:04,760 --> 02:22:09,680
about to make I say f you to the the guy that sits on my shoulder saying are you

1807
02:22:09,680 --> 02:22:16,920
sure are you sure we could get you a big boozy to shoot him with but then I would

1808
02:22:16,920 --> 02:22:20,160
shoot myself there's a how I feel about guns you're saying an F you to the

1809
02:22:20,160 --> 02:22:29,000
grant the granny questions do you wish to save are you sure is that your final

1810
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:34,160
answer if you to Regis Philbin for making that a pop culture thing if you

1811
02:22:34,160 --> 02:22:39,360
Regis all right couple more news stories for you guys and then like it or not the

1812
02:22:39,360 --> 02:22:43,720
skyline will be open one eight seven seven game olr because it is the show

1813
02:22:43,720 --> 02:22:48,880
where every gamer has a voice Loki Activision and Fendi Ward are asking

1814
02:22:48,880 --> 02:22:53,320
you do you suffer from apathy that's right they're playing on releasing the

1815
02:22:53,320 --> 02:22:59,800
first map pack for modern warfare 2 becoming tax box live on March 30th no

1816
02:22:59,800 --> 02:23:04,680
word yet when PlayStation 3 will be getting it but apparently it's gonna be

1817
02:23:04,680 --> 02:23:09,960
a timed exclusive type of thing what will the map pack include well it will

1818
02:23:09,960 --> 02:23:16,440
include a couple new maps some that are to call I guess two of them are quality

1819
02:23:16,440 --> 02:23:24,040
for modern warfare 1 remakes also apparently there's gonna be let's see

1820
02:23:24,040 --> 02:23:29,120
here some other ones including a bailout which is a multi-level apartment complex

1821
02:23:29,120 --> 02:23:34,720
that sounds kind of cool storm and open industrial park littered with heavy

1822
02:23:34,720 --> 02:23:41,200
machinery salvages snowy junkyard fortified with stacked debris and crushed

1823
02:23:41,200 --> 02:23:45,760
cars and I guess two of the maps that are getting remade from called before

1824
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:50,880
include crash which is against a war-torn urban environment and overgrown

1825
02:23:50,880 --> 02:24:02,280
which is a massive dry creek bed kind of neat all right lots of fun modern

1826
02:24:02,280 --> 02:24:07,000
warfare developments there I'm hoping actually none of those map packs I see

1827
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:11,520
the heads of infinity more say where the was the content designed before the

1828
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:15,840
heads of infinity Ward were axed I'm assuming no it's kind of funny they're

1829
02:24:15,840 --> 02:24:23,120
all you gotta love the the name of the download content is the stimulus package

1830
02:24:23,120 --> 02:24:29,440
is if that's not a slap in the face I don't know what is oh did you and they

1831
02:24:29,440 --> 02:24:33,800
should have called it infinity Ward you know I didn't realize this because I

1832
02:24:33,800 --> 02:24:37,360
don't really play games like modern warfare I mean not that they're bad

1833
02:24:37,360 --> 02:24:41,520
they're just games I don't really play I had heard that the credits in that game

1834
02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:45,320
are kind of funny because like all the studio credits you know they scroll by

1835
02:24:45,320 --> 02:24:48,160
or whatever then when it gets to the credits for Activision it speeds up and

1836
02:24:48,160 --> 02:24:52,080
they run by like eight times as fast and then it goes back to normal like there's

1837
02:24:52,080 --> 02:24:55,760
always that tongue-in-cheek we don't like Activision thing going on those

1838
02:24:55,760 --> 02:25:00,440
games I heard that on another show I thought that was funny all right uh

1839
02:25:00,440 --> 02:25:05,680
let's how about some news on monkey Island monkey Island is coming to PSN

1840
02:25:05,680 --> 02:25:12,160
Mac telltale and instant action I guess let's see the game store of course

1841
02:25:12,160 --> 02:25:16,160
instant action calm would be the other thing we're talking about there it's the

1842
02:25:16,160 --> 02:25:20,760
special edition of the secret of monkey Island and it's coming out that's pretty

1843
02:25:20,760 --> 02:25:24,520
cool though I think a lot of people have been waiting for it on PSN and of course

1844
02:25:24,520 --> 02:25:29,760
the Mac so there you go the island is sweet mm-hmm and by the way the sequel

1845
02:25:29,760 --> 02:25:35,760
the secret of monkey Island to even more sweet coming out on Xbox Live Arcade PSN

1846
02:25:35,760 --> 02:25:40,920
PC and the iPhone though the ending is really strange well there it is the

1847
02:25:40,920 --> 02:25:45,000
secret of monkey Island to coming out this summer on all those systems so it's

1848
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:49,960
not quite the special edition just so you know it's just some new controls on

1849
02:25:49,960 --> 02:25:58,120
the classic game but still still what a good what a good game good times all

1850
02:25:58,120 --> 02:26:02,160
right I guess that's it for now should we try to open up the Skype line and

1851
02:26:02,160 --> 02:26:07,680
take some calls sure all right wide up one eight seven seven game olr our

1852
02:26:07,680 --> 02:26:12,840
username on Skype is orange lounge radio Skype line is open for business while we

1853
02:26:12,840 --> 02:26:15,440
wait for some calls because it takes about a minute for the chatters to get

1854
02:26:15,440 --> 02:26:18,080
the message Loki have any last-minute stories for us or I don't know dark

1855
02:26:18,080 --> 02:26:25,520
soccer you have anything okay then Loki I'm sure I do and I'm just trying to

1856
02:26:25,520 --> 02:26:31,080
navigate myself towards the webpage where said stories would be um let's see

1857
02:26:31,080 --> 02:26:36,360
here let's talk about guitar freaks XG apparently it's been released I'm

1858
02:26:36,360 --> 02:26:39,880
assuming in Japan because I sure as hell haven't seen one over here then again

1859
02:26:39,880 --> 02:26:45,720
I've been an arcade in forever but yes guitar freaks Romania XG has been

1860
02:26:45,720 --> 02:26:51,640
released in Japan and of course you may remember XG is the one where they have

1861
02:26:51,640 --> 02:26:55,320
the extra buttons on the guitar and then the drums are a little bit fancier and

1862
02:26:55,320 --> 02:27:01,520
whatnot but uh but is the game fun I don't know well let's go to the phones

1863
02:27:01,520 --> 02:27:06,340
hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hi this act F hi act F what's on

1864
02:27:06,340 --> 02:27:11,520
your mind our friendly neighborhood Mexican how are you pretty fine I just

1865
02:27:11,520 --> 02:27:18,520
wanted to ask a quick question about the ps3 yes maybe look Loki can answer this

1866
02:27:18,520 --> 02:27:28,180
I've been hearing and reading in forums that there there are ps3 shortages yeah

1867
02:27:28,180 --> 02:27:33,920
there's rumors going around that I've been hearing it's basically they're

1868
02:27:33,920 --> 02:27:39,880
trying to sandbag their numbers for the next financial year because even right

1869
02:27:39,880 --> 02:27:43,440
now God of War 3 there were shortage problems and there's also rumors that

1870
02:27:43,440 --> 02:27:49,080
there's a disc pressing problem for God of War 3 because I know art we got

1871
02:27:49,080 --> 02:27:54,720
shorted pretty bad as well as everyone else did apparently but it's been

1872
02:27:54,720 --> 02:28:00,280
anything first party Sony's been hard to get for like the whole year so far and

1873
02:28:00,280 --> 02:28:04,440
it's supposed to be a lot better in April when their new financial year

1874
02:28:04,440 --> 02:28:07,920
starts so that they're basically trying to suck as much sales as they can to

1875
02:28:07,920 --> 02:28:11,400
next year to make it look better let me jump in for a minute here because yeah I

1876
02:28:11,400 --> 02:28:15,920
just to support what you're saying I got a text message when ps3 mageddon was

1877
02:28:15,920 --> 02:28:20,560
going on and it was one of my friends who I guess booted up her ps3 and it

1878
02:28:20,560 --> 02:28:24,960
was right when the issue happened so nobody knew that there was a time and

1879
02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:28,780
date issue going on and she thought the thing was broken so she went to Best Buy

1880
02:28:28,780 --> 02:28:32,380
and text messaged me and said dude you might want to know for your show Best Buy

1881
02:28:32,380 --> 02:28:36,640
has no PlayStation threes in stock and their computer has one in the nation

1882
02:28:36,640 --> 02:28:41,260
located in a store and I was like I kind of took that as a really type of thing

1883
02:28:41,260 --> 02:28:44,320
and I didn't like I got the text messages after the show so I didn't even

1884
02:28:44,320 --> 02:28:47,080
really give it a second thought but it does sound like there's some type of

1885
02:28:47,080 --> 02:28:54,480
shortage going on strange yeah I thought it was related to the the apocalypse

1886
02:28:54,480 --> 02:28:59,960
thing that happened on February 28 no it's nothing to do with that it's just

1887
02:28:59,960 --> 02:29:04,960
they've been out for a while and usually if there's some sort of time period

1888
02:29:04,960 --> 02:29:08,760
right after you know the fourth quarter that they're trying to catch up because

1889
02:29:08,760 --> 02:29:12,440
they basically you know at least on a distribution side they try to ship

1890
02:29:12,440 --> 02:29:14,960
everything to retailers and the retailers leave them on their shelves

1891
02:29:14,960 --> 02:29:20,440
and that's that I want to say though it's a blessing in some ways that that

1892
02:29:20,440 --> 02:29:24,640
happened when ps3 Magetta and happened because think about how many people

1893
02:29:24,640 --> 02:29:28,960
might have done what my friend did almost did and saying my ps3 stopped

1894
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:31,960
working guess it's time for me to get a new one and actually goes out and buys

1895
02:29:31,960 --> 02:29:37,480
a new one and then oh it was just a 24-hour issue shit you know like well

1896
02:29:37,480 --> 02:29:40,840
you could always return it I guess so but you know some stores take a fee for

1897
02:29:40,840 --> 02:29:44,740
that and stuff so it's maybe a blessing in disguise that there were hardly any

1898
02:29:44,740 --> 02:29:48,960
ps3s on shelves to get so people couldn't have that knee-jerk reaction

1899
02:29:48,960 --> 02:29:53,880
of oh I'll just get a new ps3 probably thank gosh or else Sony might have been

1900
02:29:53,880 --> 02:29:56,840
in some bigger doo-doo than they were but you notice how most people already

1901
02:29:56,840 --> 02:30:01,760
forgot that that happened already already passed it we've moved on

1902
02:30:01,760 --> 02:30:06,000
interesting Bob coffee in our chat room chat dot orange on twitter.com piping in

1903
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:07,720
Walmart hasn't gotten any in a while either

1904
02:30:07,720 --> 02:30:12,160
giovide says my targets been out for three weeks so definitely not just a

1905
02:30:12,160 --> 02:30:15,320
best buy thing it does sound like there is some truth to this rumor but you

1906
02:30:15,320 --> 02:30:19,160
watch if if all sudden in April they start having tons of them everywhere

1907
02:30:19,160 --> 02:30:23,680
that's why because they were sandbagging them really I didn't think about it that

1908
02:30:23,680 --> 02:30:26,920
way that's a really that's the rumors Nintendo doing something like that too

1909
02:30:26,920 --> 02:30:30,560
or are they still saying oh well I don't know you're gonna hear a lot more stuff

1910
02:30:30,560 --> 02:30:34,320
about Sony this week because destination PlayStation is happening now that's the

1911
02:30:34,320 --> 02:30:37,920
retail only event but there's always people that manage to sneak their way in

1912
02:30:37,920 --> 02:30:42,240
moles and stuff of course yeah because we have our people it's kind of bad that

1913
02:30:42,240 --> 02:30:45,640
that happened it's happening right now it's considering that there's Final

1914
02:30:45,640 --> 02:30:52,160
Fantasy 13 and God of War coming out next week so I don't know why they well

1915
02:30:52,160 --> 02:30:58,200
you already explained it but I I would expect them to at least put a little

1916
02:30:58,200 --> 02:31:02,800
more of the consoles out there in the market keep in mind though act F Sony

1917
02:31:02,800 --> 02:31:06,720
lost a lot of oomph and people running out to buy a ps3 for Final Fantasy 13

1918
02:31:06,720 --> 02:31:11,000
when it jumped ship to 360 as well and you know like I've mentioned earlier in

1919
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:14,360
the night I think it was over on Bobby show but you know there really is no

1920
02:31:14,360 --> 02:31:19,080
reason to run out and buy a ps3 if you already have a 360 for Final Fantasy 13

1921
02:31:19,080 --> 02:31:22,760
just get it on the 360 the differences are not major enough to necessitate the

1922
02:31:22,760 --> 02:31:27,480
change but God of War 3 now you can't get that anywhere else so yeah I think

1923
02:31:27,480 --> 02:31:31,700
you make a good point it seems really strange that Sony would not want God of

1924
02:31:31,700 --> 02:31:34,920
War 3 to be moving because that that's a system seller for some people it really

1925
02:31:34,920 --> 02:31:39,720
is I know they just figured that they're gonna sell those copies it's just if

1926
02:31:39,720 --> 02:31:46,320
they don't sell them right now it's no big deal but we'll see I mean well act

1927
02:31:46,320 --> 02:31:48,760
F we gotta let you go so we can get more calls do you have any other thoughts for

02:33:04,360 --> 02:33:10,740
you know I try calling the number dollar day you know at least all the day the

1943
02:33:10,740 --> 02:33:17,840
number was working if you know if he doesn't mind I would like to give more

1944
02:33:17,840 --> 02:33:23,840
constructive criticism for me oh wait hold on Loki Loki are you willing to

1945
02:33:23,840 --> 02:33:27,120
accept some constructive criticism yeah sure why not all right then go ahead

1946
02:33:27,120 --> 02:33:34,120
yeah yeah I know this is kind of some somewhat harsh but I I could have seen

1947
02:33:34,120 --> 02:33:42,520
this coming a mile away for a couple couple reasons if I put Lussy on

1948
02:33:42,520 --> 02:33:48,760
Craigslist which is practically the ghetto of the Internet you know you

1949
02:33:48,760 --> 02:33:54,320
hear reports you know other news by Craigslist practically every other day

1950
02:33:54,320 --> 02:33:59,840
but the personal ads are hilarious that's true well hold on let me give

1951
02:33:59,840 --> 02:34:03,640
Loki a chance to defend himself why did you go to the bowels of the internet I

1952
02:34:03,640 --> 02:34:06,320
mean well I don't know I mean there there are there is 4chan because

1953
02:34:06,320 --> 02:34:10,320
Craigslist Craigslist is kind of in that same you know colony area of the

1954
02:34:10,320 --> 02:34:15,600
internet what made you decide to go there to get your needs basically

1955
02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:19,400
because and you know really looking at it now I could probably just done a

1956
02:34:19,400 --> 02:34:26,440
j-tag install myself but the thing is I wanted to install the cyclot the the

1957
02:34:26,440 --> 02:34:32,440
Cygnus to mod ship in there and that's a lot more difficult to install versus you

1958
02:34:32,440 --> 02:34:37,800
know the just a j-tag a j-tag I mean shit I could I could do that I mean that

1959
02:34:37,800 --> 02:34:43,040
it's like seven solder points and that's it and they're big but the reason why I

1960
02:34:43,040 --> 02:34:46,120
went in Craigslist and stuff like eBay although I lucked out on eBay because

1961
02:34:46,120 --> 02:34:49,120
someone sold it cuz eBay they're not allowed to sell that stuff you can't

1962
02:34:49,120 --> 02:34:53,000
sell modded consoles you can't sell mod chips you can't sell anything like that

1963
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:57,160
every now and then stuff slips through where you can buy that stuff thankfully

1964
02:34:57,160 --> 02:35:03,000
I was able to buy one of those and really it wouldn't have been a big deal

1965
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:09,400
to go you know testing why should done is gone should have just not let the

1966
02:35:09,400 --> 02:35:14,360
console should have just gone with the car did he try to talk you into it like

1967
02:35:14,360 --> 02:35:17,240
okay buddy all you know just come back in a couple hours and I'll have your

1968
02:35:17,240 --> 02:35:20,600
console all done it wasn't even that it was like 30 minutes like I was gonna go

1969
02:35:20,600 --> 02:35:28,320
eat and whose idea was it to leave his but you know I could see that where that

1970
02:35:28,320 --> 02:35:31,920
would be something you know we're yeah when you're in that I mean yeah I

1971
02:35:31,920 --> 02:35:36,240
understand it was 2020 but when you're in the moment and you're like okay I

1972
02:35:36,240 --> 02:35:39,800
kind of trust this guy he's got his phone lots of for me from Craigslist

1973
02:35:39,800 --> 02:35:43,240
before and it's been fine yeah and and to be fair although I'm joking about it

1974
02:35:43,240 --> 02:35:47,840
being you know the bells the internet I I've seen job postings and stuff work

1975
02:35:47,840 --> 02:35:52,240
on there's people on great companies posted availabilities and Craigslist so

1976
02:35:52,240 --> 02:35:57,600
there are useful purposes I think if if as far as it goes with like services and

1977
02:35:57,600 --> 02:36:01,040
stuff like that you just have to be careful as far as like you know

1978
02:36:01,040 --> 02:36:05,760
especially with adult services for the love of God if you're gonna seek adult

1979
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:10,000
services on Craigslist you not only need to use protect you need to use like

1980
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:14,080
three methods of protection all at once and that's assuming that it is actually

1981
02:36:14,080 --> 02:36:17,580
somebody and not just a police sting yeah and then you're gonna want to bay

1982
02:36:17,580 --> 02:36:22,160
them bleach honestly yeah but you know no seriously you know it's just you know

1983
02:36:22,160 --> 02:36:26,240
some stupid things and what you need to do obviously if you're getting you know

1984
02:36:26,240 --> 02:36:31,080
some services done online you know where you're gonna get something taken for you

1985
02:36:31,080 --> 02:36:36,440
a legitimate person would give you like some sort of receipt you would you would

1986
02:36:36,440 --> 02:36:40,160
have an address you wouldn't you know go to an address and he'd be waiting

1987
02:36:40,160 --> 02:36:45,040
outside of like I there's a lot of red flags like for example the address that

1988
02:36:45,040 --> 02:36:50,400
he gave me you know it's an apartment complex it's not not a house I thought

1989
02:36:50,400 --> 02:36:53,560
it was a house I was like okay well that guy's address you know where's he gonna

1990
02:36:53,560 --> 02:36:58,160
go you know it's a house but knows apartment complex where his friend

1991
02:36:58,160 --> 02:37:02,240
probably lived and let her yeah who knows but he has this down to a science

1992
02:37:02,240 --> 02:37:05,120
he ripped you off he'll rip someone else up my question is what's he doing with

1993
02:37:05,120 --> 02:37:09,120
all these 360s I don't know probably selling them all right let me fuck drugs

1994
02:37:09,120 --> 02:37:13,520
who knows it's a spazz nator I'm sorry yeah I was good yeah I was about to say

1995
02:37:13,520 --> 02:37:20,240
the same thing for at least 10 to 15 years and now well now throughout the

1996
02:37:20,240 --> 02:37:26,680
country not just my area or even just your area councils especially when

1997
02:37:26,680 --> 02:37:34,760
they're still at the $250 to $300 range are really really big with seed they

1998
02:37:34,760 --> 02:37:42,640
take those $250 to $300 console deal them turn around turn around and sell them

1999
02:37:42,640 --> 02:37:49,600
for 50 to $100 and Dell or just trade them straight out for drugs whether

2000
02:37:49,600 --> 02:37:55,680
their drug of choice happen happen you never know and it's a bummer with since

2001
02:37:55,680 --> 02:38:00,760
Xbox has the ability to lock out your console when you you know when you do

2002
02:38:00,760 --> 02:38:04,120
something naughty and expose life it's kind of a pity they don't have a type of

2003
02:38:04,120 --> 02:38:08,060
service where you could call in and find out where your 360 is or who's

2004
02:38:08,060 --> 02:38:10,520
connecting to the internet and I mean granted they don't want to help people

2005
02:38:10,520 --> 02:38:14,280
like Loki but some people get their 360s legitimately stolen out of their home

2006
02:38:14,280 --> 02:38:17,000
like I remember spazz nator weren't you the guy that had your ps3 taken right

2007
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:26,200
out of your house yeah yeah yeah and oh well I lean off Bob back in 2003

2008
02:38:26,200 --> 02:38:34,280
literally just as the calories switch over from July to August two guys

2009
02:38:34,280 --> 02:38:44,600
barged into my apartment building and it's going by PlayStation 2 I called the

2010
02:38:44,600 --> 02:38:50,800
police immediately but you know unfortunately you know with buffer

2011
02:38:50,800 --> 02:38:56,720
police I hate to see it you know what there's like a whole stash of jelly

2012
02:38:56,720 --> 02:39:06,120
filled bullets it's hard to track to because there's not like unique license

2013
02:39:06,120 --> 02:39:09,440
plates or whatever but there is I mean there's a serial number I have the

2014
02:39:09,440 --> 02:39:14,640
serial number but it's a bummer you can't track the way it does it's a bummer Xbox

2015
02:39:14,640 --> 02:39:19,360
punch in serial number and you know here's the thing tells you where it's

2016
02:39:19,360 --> 02:39:23,920
the guy knew what he was doing as far as j-tagging stuff because he knew what he

2017
02:39:23,920 --> 02:39:28,120
was talking about but like he probably not only runs a service he probably mod

2018
02:39:28,120 --> 02:39:32,200
your stolen 360 and sells it well here's the thing and I don't really have a

2019
02:39:32,200 --> 02:39:35,920
problem of 360 was stolen I have a problem that I waited you know four

2020
02:39:35,920 --> 02:39:41,240
hours in Stockton don't waste my time exactly I'm like if you're the DCC to

2021
02:39:41,240 --> 02:39:45,840
just mug me you know seriously if he's gonna steal my system just don't respond

2022
02:39:45,840 --> 02:39:50,080
back to any of my phone calls at all instead of like dragging on for four

2023
02:39:50,080 --> 02:39:54,200
fucking hours okay because that was really the issue I have 360 consoles I

2024
02:39:54,200 --> 02:39:57,920
don't really give a crap if one of them goes away it's it's just an inconvenience

2025
02:39:57,920 --> 02:40:02,520
for me to sit there for four fucking hours in a car waiting for somebody I

2026
02:40:02,520 --> 02:40:05,640
gotta wrap up here and let's fascinating in his final thoughts cuz we had to get

2027
02:40:05,640 --> 02:40:07,800
some more calls but I do want to read this comment from chat cuz it's funny

2028
02:40:07,800 --> 02:40:11,400

knives I've had my ex I have had all my airsoft guns stolen that was worth way

2033
02:40:26,580 --> 02:40:30,600

2037
02:40:40,680 --> 02:40:45,800
have any other lots for our listeners tonight nothing comes to mind nothing

2038
02:40:45,800 --> 02:40:52,440
they'll take five seconds or less but I'll I'll talk to Loki about this you

2039
02:40:52,440 --> 02:40:57,800
should wear your eyes throughout the weekend like live or on Twitter or

2040
02:40:57,800 --> 02:41:03,400
whatever so just be careful he might mess with you like he was messing with

2041
02:41:03,400 --> 02:41:06,640
cheeseburger oh that was just earlier and hey I can't believe he got so

2042
02:41:06,640 --> 02:41:10,160
confused by and I was just like he must have me confused the other Loki you're

2043
02:41:10,160 --> 02:41:12,840
so rude you know all right all right take care of spasm nator thanks for the

2044
02:41:12,840 --> 02:41:16,860
call have a good one yep I gotta ask spasm nator if he's watching the tester

2045
02:41:16,860 --> 02:41:21,440
because he's a big Sony fan I mean usually he'll cut he'll call in although

2046
02:41:21,440 --> 02:41:24,300
he I don't know about anymore because I know he's been having his issue with

2047
02:41:24,300 --> 02:41:29,440
Sony's lately but I gotta ask him if he's been watching that because it seems

2048
02:41:29,440 --> 02:41:33,040
like as a Sony fan maybe that's something he's into I don't know I can't

2049
02:41:33,040 --> 02:41:37,480
believe I'm admitting I've actually been watching the tester it's not terrible

2050
02:41:37,480 --> 02:41:43,920
I'm gonna file it under the Tron and showgirls category it's it's so bad it's

2051
02:41:43,920 --> 02:41:47,680
kind of good I can't explain it and seriously the whole reason I put they

2052
02:41:47,680 --> 02:41:51,120
got the guy's phone number and email cuz I know that the police aren't gonna do

2053
02:41:51,120 --> 02:41:53,720
anything they're not gonna be able to do anything because they don't have a name

2054
02:41:53,720 --> 02:41:57,400
they don't have an actual law they just they just have it so at least at the

2055
02:41:57,400 --> 02:42:00,920
very the very least it'll make them think maybe twice about like doing

2056
02:42:00,920 --> 02:42:03,440
something like that because it's really inconvenient I've got to get to the

2057
02:42:03,440 --> 02:42:06,880
phones guys the phones are lighting up tonight like there are so look I have a

2058
02:42:06,880 --> 02:42:11,040
screen full of people trying to get in thank you guys so much I'm just trying

2059
02:42:11,040 --> 02:42:15,300
to answer these as fast as I can hire an orange launch radio who's this this is

2060
02:42:15,300 --> 02:42:19,840
Amiga 777 Amiga 777 what is on your mind my friend

2061
02:42:19,840 --> 02:42:25,960
hi I just like us to send a public apology to some of the listeners from

2062
02:42:25,960 --> 02:42:29,600
Japan that might have been listening last week hmm I guess about some of the

2063
02:42:29,600 --> 02:42:34,840
things that I said about you know the whole PlayStation 2 birthday 10-year

2064
02:42:34,840 --> 02:42:46,000
thing yeah um it actually you know ps2 is alright it it um there there are a

2065
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:49,280
lot of things you know kind of going back to that question you're like what

2066
02:42:49,280 --> 02:42:58,560
could the Dreamcast it done better and so going back on that um well I could I

2067
02:42:58,560 --> 02:43:03,920
probably enter the end to that question maybe toward in um let's see October you

2068
02:43:03,920 --> 02:43:09,120
know which is technically the the month that it came out the ps2 came out here

2069
02:43:09,120 --> 02:43:16,720
and now the u.s. okay no amiga I remember your call and I don't I don't

2070
02:43:16,720 --> 02:43:20,360
think you have to go out of your way to apologize it was your own opinion and

2071
02:43:20,360 --> 02:43:26,120
what-have-you and last week was a little bit crazy anyway but um you know I I

2072
02:43:26,120 --> 02:43:29,280
think you kind of bring up a point though that certainly the PlayStation 2

2073
02:43:29,280 --> 02:43:33,160
saw levels of success in other countries that may not have even been you know

2074
02:43:33,160 --> 02:43:40,680
kind of duplicated here or what have you okay that was just one thing those on my

2075
02:43:40,680 --> 02:43:45,080
mind all right well you know what it it it takes a real man to man up to an

2076
02:43:45,080 --> 02:43:48,240
apology although I don't think you needed to apologize he had a perfectly

2077
02:43:48,240 --> 02:43:53,160
fine opinion but that's that's fine you you said your piece but I I think can't

2078
02:43:53,160 --> 02:43:56,440
we all just get along there's room there's room in retro gaming love for

2079

2084
02:44:19,200 --> 02:44:23,080

2088
02:44:34,600 --> 02:44:38,120
I got the temperament to go with it that's all right that's all right well

2089
02:44:38,120 --> 02:44:41,120
there's just not much I can do with what the information I have and stuff it's

2090
02:44:41,120 --> 02:44:45,520
not like I can go the guy's house and demand you know justice I don't know I

2091
02:44:45,520 --> 02:44:48,000
don't know where the hell he lives and I don't know what the hell's name is I

2092
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:51,720
mean cuz he's used like a couple different names and so you know at this

2093
02:44:51,720 --> 02:44:57,320
point lesson learned you know that's all you have to do you have to use this as

2094
02:44:57,320 --> 02:45:00,520
an opportunity not that we should be encouraging people to mod their consoles

2095
02:45:00,520 --> 02:45:04,840
anyway but you had a legitimate I mean I think it's legitimate to want to mod

2096
02:45:04,840 --> 02:45:08,520
your 360 to play Japanese games every week on this show I talk about Japanese

2097
02:45:08,520 --> 02:45:11,340
release dates and even just tonight I said oh here's the game on the 360 looks

2098
02:45:11,340 --> 02:45:15,280
interesting it'll never come out over here so people have a legitimate reason

2099
02:45:15,280 --> 02:45:20,120
to want to mod their 360 to play Japanese games but let Loki's pain be a

2100
02:45:20,120 --> 02:45:25,040
lesson to the rest of you be careful and if somebody smart use common sense and

2101
02:45:25,040 --> 02:45:30,560
oh I didn't use this don't trust a dude you met on Craigslist with your console

2102
02:45:30,560 --> 02:45:35,040
ever do not walk away don't get talking to it just say no I'll just hang out

2103
02:45:35,040 --> 02:45:38,080
here well I can I watch you do it or whatever or you know I'll just I'll just

2104
02:45:38,080 --> 02:45:43,000
kind of just you know sit here and watch you from my car be just upfront honest

2105
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:46,880
be like listen dude I don't I just met you I don't fucking trust you so you

2106
02:45:46,880 --> 02:45:50,320
know I'm going with the console you know you either gonna you know do this real

2107
02:45:50,320 --> 02:45:54,960
quick and the other thing too I mean it's like seriously if it's going to

2108
02:45:54,960 --> 02:45:57,800
take four hours I want to be there fucking going hey listen are you done

2109
02:45:57,800 --> 02:46:01,480
are you done are you done are you done you know or like you know if it's taking

2110
02:46:01,480 --> 02:46:05,060
too damn long list and I'll just finish the rest of home you know because that

2111
02:46:05,060 --> 02:46:10,020
it's just it's absolutely ridiculous I have to wait for four hours and it's

2112
02:46:10,020 --> 02:46:14,680
Just that was the part that pissed me off is the fact that he drug it out for four fucking hours

2113
02:46:14,680 --> 02:46:19,100
If you're gonna steal the thing just say you just don't reply back or just reply back to the text

2114
02:46:19,100 --> 02:46:21,100
You know sucker and then that's it

2115
02:46:21,700 --> 02:46:25,060
He's like seriously. What are you gonna? Do it's like you know I can't track you down

2116
02:46:25,060 --> 02:46:30,500
I don't know the fuck you live so you know I wish I did follow him cuz then I'd know where the fuck you lived

2117
02:46:30,500 --> 02:46:35,220
I would be going right straight to his apartment or probably just wouldn't have gotten anything me

2118
02:46:35,220 --> 02:46:40,240
Oh, just or one of the listeners will have gone straight to his apartment by now, but unfortunately probably there you go

2119
02:46:40,540 --> 02:46:46,540
Well, I did you have any do you have any any further advice? I guess maybe for Loki don't use crack

2120
02:46:46,540 --> 02:46:48,500
I don't know I

2121
02:46:48,500 --> 02:46:50,500
Well, you know trust no one

2122
02:46:51,820 --> 02:46:55,820
Pretty much if I tore or if you're gonna go use someone on Craigslist or whatever like that

2123
02:46:55,820 --> 02:47:01,140
Just like be really crazy about it, and they'll fingerprint the guy you know or you know

2124
02:47:01,140 --> 02:47:06,660
Or if you if he takes your 360 take their driver's license or something

2125
02:47:07,540 --> 02:47:11,840
That could be fake too. Well most people. I don't think would expect that you know it's true

2126
02:47:12,460 --> 02:47:14,940
Yeah, the one time I had a console chipped

2127
02:47:14,940 --> 02:47:20,020
It was somebody who knew somebody and that was back in the day when my PlayStation 1 oh

2128
02:47:21,220 --> 02:47:27,100
Man the PlayStation 1 was so easy to mod though you had a dark Sakura bought me a plug

2129
02:47:27,100 --> 02:47:31,780
It's like a present for I don't know something that I just plugged into the back of the thing you did

2130
02:47:31,780 --> 02:47:33,620
I don't know if you remember

2131
02:47:33,620 --> 02:47:36,460
Mix I got mine chip just to play two games

2132
02:47:38,380 --> 02:47:41,060
You did that's how we play remember the one day in my apartment

2133
02:47:41,060 --> 02:47:44,580
We all came all the sacramentals came over to play DDR third mix

2134
02:47:44,660 --> 02:47:48,380
That's when I discovered my love for erotic and oh Nick, please not so quick. Yeah

2135
02:47:49,020 --> 02:47:51,620
The thing that I the IO port thing

2136
02:47:51,620 --> 02:47:57,420
Mm-hmm yeah, yeah, there's like a little plug in the back you gave me one the game because I think you know

2137
02:47:57,420 --> 02:48:01,900
I don't have the skills disorder, so I had someone do I also have another our form looking to get rid of

2138
02:48:02,660 --> 02:48:06,360
We use those for a while, but like for the longest time Dan

2139
02:48:06,360 --> 02:48:08,360
And I didn't need them because we could still

2140
02:48:08,740 --> 02:48:11,360
disk swap on our PlayStation

2141
02:48:12,180 --> 02:48:14,180
The single swap oh

2142
02:48:14,300 --> 02:48:17,660
Yeah, there was like a trick you could do for it the first one

2143
02:48:17,660 --> 02:48:23,920
It was just the single stop and swap it would load the um the PlayStation screen, and then you stop the spinner by

2144
02:48:24,580 --> 02:48:27,940
Pressing the little button to the thing yeah, and then you move it out

2145
02:48:27,940 --> 02:48:33,980
We used a paperclip to do it crazy crazy stuff all right well Brad anything else in your mind tonight

2146
02:48:33,980 --> 02:48:41,300
You want to talk about well with the you know games are expensive and stuff, and I've got the studio and turmoil here

2147
02:48:41,300 --> 02:48:43,300
Cuz we're packing up to move

2148
02:48:43,300 --> 02:48:48,780
but to save a few bucks and some something that not everyone might think about is

2149
02:48:49,660 --> 02:48:52,300
I've been buying a lot of games used from game fly

2150
02:48:53,380 --> 02:48:57,020
Chief I just picked up like brutal legend Batman Arkham Asylum and

2151
02:48:58,300 --> 02:49:02,280
Ghostbusters for like less than a price of one game new they've been sending me

2152
02:49:02,280 --> 02:49:04,080
I've actually been using game fly now

2153
02:49:04,080 --> 02:49:07,580
I have this really bad habit of hanging on to one game for like six months

2154
02:49:07,580 --> 02:49:09,980
But yeah, they send me emails all the time about hey

2155
02:49:09,980 --> 02:49:12,140
Do you just want to buy the game you've had for like four months?

2156
02:49:12,140 --> 02:49:13,500
you

2157
02:49:13,500 --> 02:49:17,940
Know and it's it's not a bad idea, and I think they give you like a little bit of money

2158
02:49:17,940 --> 02:49:19,580
I mean, it's like five bucks ten bucks

2159
02:49:19,580 --> 02:49:23,140
It's not very significant, but it's enough to try and hook you the little fish bait

2160
02:49:23,140 --> 02:49:25,940
You know I don't know if I hook you you know they're there

2161
02:49:25,940 --> 02:49:28,960
They're at the top of their game for the service. They're providing

2162
02:49:28,960 --> 02:49:32,460
It's not a service for ever for everybody, but it's a it's a good service

2163
02:49:33,100 --> 02:49:39,020
So I don't use it that often just like I'm kind of broke right now, but yeah use games nothing wrong with that

2164
02:49:39,020 --> 02:49:44,140
There's so many games that came out like a year ago that I didn't have time to play that there's

2165
02:49:44,820 --> 02:49:49,780
There's 20 bucks a pop now for real for real so good advice to the

2166
02:49:51,220 --> 02:49:54,380
Gamer in this economy I suppose all right well Brad

2167
02:49:54,380 --> 02:49:56,180
We got to let you go because our phone lines have been on fire

2168
02:49:56,180 --> 02:49:58,740
And I want to get at least one more call hey later guys later, buddy

2169
02:49:59,260 --> 02:50:05,180
Alright again, please don't be butthurt if you don't get through our phone call or of course now

2170
02:50:05,180 --> 02:50:09,700
It's not lit up, but probably cuz everyone still hears Brad on the phone. I wanted to tell you Rob

2171
02:50:09,700 --> 02:50:14,920
Yeah, I actually went on to the iTunes store cuz really I wanted to buy Final Fantasy 2

2172
02:50:15,980 --> 02:50:21,860
And I found reviews for Street Fighter 4. Oh, yes, I come out during GDC. I heard yeah, yeah

2173
02:50:22,020 --> 02:50:26,220
I'm probably gonna pick it up after payday. I'm just given that out of

2174
02:50:27,380 --> 02:50:29,380
567 reviews

2175
02:50:29,700 --> 02:50:32,500
It's it's currently sitting at

2176
02:50:32,500 --> 02:50:34,740
Let me see okay out of

2177
02:50:35,420 --> 02:50:37,420
894 ratings it's got

2178
02:50:37,940 --> 02:50:42,900
668 five-star, so it's currently at a four and a half star. That's not bad

2179
02:50:42,900 --> 02:50:47,820
And yeah, I couldn't believe though that controls are any good, but we got another call

2180
02:50:47,820 --> 02:50:50,900
So I'm gonna go to the phones hi you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

2181
02:50:52,300 --> 02:50:59,820
CT hey I haven't heard from you in a long time. How are you DT? I know good good good. What's that shirt by the way?

2182
02:51:00,580 --> 02:51:02,260
What's that?

2183
02:51:02,260 --> 02:51:04,460
It's not a shirt from our first tournament

2184
02:51:05,100 --> 02:51:12,220
Way the hell back. Oh my god. That's like finding your class of 96 shirt in a truck somewhere

2185
02:51:12,700 --> 02:51:15,980
That's awesome. Yes the what would the first tournament was scat right?

2186
02:51:19,140 --> 02:51:22,220
Cosplay and tournament for those that don't know okay again

2187
02:51:22,220 --> 02:51:26,940
Let me just let me quickly give the backstory for those that have listened to olr a very long time

2188
02:51:26,940 --> 02:51:32,340
This show was formed because Loki myself and dark Sakura and DT

2189
02:51:32,340 --> 02:51:36,380
You're a part of this circle too would meet up at the arcade and play DDR games

2190
02:51:36,380 --> 02:51:41,000
And that's how we all kind of met and of course our show started about music-based video games because of that

2191
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:46,100
But when the memani series started kind of tapering off, you know we branched out to saying you know well hell

2192
02:51:46,100 --> 02:51:49,060
We play all video games. We don't just play DDR. Let's talk about all video games

2193
02:51:49,060 --> 02:51:51,060
So that's that's where we've been at for a few years

2194
02:51:51,060 --> 02:51:57,780
um, but as part of this DDR tournament throwing or as part of this DDR loving circle

2195
02:51:57,780 --> 02:52:00,940
We used to throw tournaments and the first one we had was scat

2196
02:52:01,620 --> 02:52:03,620
sacramentals because we're from Sacramento, California

2197
02:52:03,900 --> 02:52:07,680
Cosplay and tournament and we actually encouraged people to dress up although

2198
02:52:07,680 --> 02:52:10,740
I think we had like maybe four people all day that actually came dressed up serious

2199
02:52:10,740 --> 02:52:13,780
and then we had a DDR tournament which actually for its time a

2200
02:52:14,140 --> 02:52:17,960
Lot of people like Sacramento we had a ton of people show up

2201
02:52:17,960 --> 02:52:23,280
Sacramento was kind of the place you went cuz you just don't give a fuck like I think a lot of people didn't take our

2202
02:52:23,280 --> 02:52:28,480
Tournament that seriously, and it was okay like people had fun with it, and you know me you know dark sire

2203
02:52:28,480 --> 02:52:33,120
You know Loki we're all about just having fun like I think Loki if I remember right Oh Loki

2204
02:52:33,120 --> 02:52:36,860
I'm gonna embarrass Loki Loki had a dynamite rave routine ready to go

2205
02:52:36,860 --> 02:52:41,480
And it was it's not really I just I had at one point memorized dynamite rave backwards

2206
02:52:41,480 --> 02:52:46,120
And he was dressed up like one of the guys from the matrix because it was that many years ago

2207
02:52:46,120 --> 02:52:48,320
It was because I had a trench coat on and well

2208
02:52:48,320 --> 02:52:53,900
That's what you look like and he started to dance and I have and I forgot with the but he laughed

2209
02:52:54,680 --> 02:52:56,680
He didn't go in the corner and cry

2210
02:52:56,680 --> 02:53:01,840
He just he was he laughed and we all laughed at him, but no we all left with him alright

2211
02:53:02,200 --> 02:53:05,160
And then we left at him. No. I'm just kidding, but now look

2212
02:53:06,160 --> 02:53:10,760
Would we have ever had Loki on the show if it wasn't for dynamite rave and probably we would have but yeah

2213
02:53:10,760 --> 02:53:17,540
All right, so I'm sorry DT. So you found this shirt. What else did you want to say? Well?

2214
02:53:19,360 --> 02:53:21,360
Yeah

2215
02:53:22,680 --> 02:53:28,760
Go ahead dark Tetsuya if you have anything else you want to ask us or talk about tonight the best of

2216
02:53:31,400 --> 02:53:34,120

Narration for the best of and I'm sure there's gonna be a week in the near future

2225
02:54:01,320 --> 02:54:04,720
We're not gonna be here in fact actually in two weeks

I mean, maybe dark soccer and Loki will still do the show without me, but I don't fly back till Monday

2228
02:54:14,760 --> 02:54:16,880
So we may not be here. Maybe

2229
02:54:18,280 --> 02:54:23,200
That'll be a fun show tune in it for that night when I'm not here and dark soccer is running the control board

2230
02:54:23,200 --> 02:54:24,680
That's gonna be a high

You're gonna have to totally show me the stuff that I'm missing by the way can't wait

02:54:45,720 --> 02:54:51,300
Yeah, I actually passed me. Well, I got this. I don't know if Loki's heard of it the ESR

2236
02:54:52,120 --> 02:54:54,120
Memory card exploit. Okay?

2237
02:54:54,920 --> 02:54:56,920
You can play copies on it

2238
02:54:56,920 --> 02:55:01,680
Mm-hmm. Very cool. Yeah, IDG finally

2239
02:55:02,360 --> 02:55:05,560
Congratulations, that's quite an accomplishment. So very cool. All right

2240
02:55:06,120 --> 02:55:11,020
DT I'm gonna let you go. Have a good one, buddy. And thanks for calling. All right. Bye. Bye

2241
02:55:12,640 --> 02:55:18,200
SSJ 100 Matt actually has a really good suggestion chat saying we should try to do a pre-recorded packed show

2242
02:55:18,800 --> 02:55:23,320
Actually, what I think would be really funny is that maybe there won't be a live show next week

2243
02:55:23,320 --> 02:55:29,760
but maybe there'll be some type of recorded show and like cuz I know I'm going to PAX with my buddy seg who

2244
02:55:30,600 --> 02:55:36,600
Who he was part of the oom loud crew and my friend Amanda who's really funny and she's never been on the show cuz I think

2245
02:55:36,600 --> 02:55:41,120
She works a lot Sunday nights, but she's you've met Amanda. Of course, Jamie, right, you know little little Amanda

2246
02:55:41,120 --> 02:55:43,620
It's going to PAX. How random is that go?

2247
02:55:44,600 --> 02:55:46,280
So we're all going I think it might be fun

2248
02:55:46,280 --> 02:55:49,360
We might do like a recorded thing and then I know all our fans are gonna be there

2249
02:55:49,360 --> 02:55:53,820
So I will tell you next week if I'm gonna have a hat or a shirt or something

2250
02:55:54,040 --> 02:55:58,460
To look for me and I need to look at the schedule. I will pin can finish your scarf

2251
02:55:58,920 --> 02:56:04,680
You should look for the rainbow scarf. Ah, too bad. You can't make me an orange scarf. I can make you an orange scarf

2252
02:56:04,680 --> 02:56:06,680
Can you whip one up in like a week and a half?

2253
02:56:07,360 --> 02:56:09,360
This is me. Do you make you a hat?

2254
02:56:10,160 --> 02:56:13,440
Can you make one that says olr on it might be a little tough?

2255
02:56:13,440 --> 02:56:18,080
Might be a little tough. I'm not that good yet. Why don't that make you just a big obnoxious orange scarf? Okay?

2256
02:56:18,080 --> 02:56:24,280
A big obnoxious orange scarf. Excellent. I'll even put fuzzy fringe on it. Excellent. Make it fuzzy and very gay. Okay. Okay, excellent

2257
02:56:24,280 --> 02:56:26,240
That means the rainbow one might have to wait a little bit

2258
02:56:26,240 --> 02:56:30,200
It's for it's for a good cause by the way, the skype line is gonna be closed

2259
02:56:30,200 --> 02:56:32,960
I'm sorry, don't be butthurt if you didn't get through. I'm very sorry

2260
02:56:32,960 --> 02:56:37,320
Send us an email mailbag orangeonshorey.com quick write it down now what you were wanting to call in about

2261
02:56:38,520 --> 02:56:40,880
yeah, big flamey orange scarf and

2262
02:56:40,880 --> 02:56:45,240
I will find a game room like, you know, they do the game rooms at PAX

2263
02:56:45,240 --> 02:56:48,720
I'm gonna look at what games are going on and especially if there's like a music based one

2264
02:56:48,720 --> 02:56:52,000
I will make it a point to be there for like DDR

2265
02:56:52,280 --> 02:56:56,760
Hour or you know as a throwback to how this show started

2266
02:56:56,760 --> 02:57:00,560
I will make it a point to be there doing a music game thing and I know there's quite a few

2267
02:57:00,880 --> 02:57:03,080
Olr listeners going so I hope to see you guys

2268
02:57:03,400 --> 02:57:08,160
Yeah, and I like what act F to say make a pre-recorded pre-pack show and a best of the same week

2269
02:57:08,160 --> 02:57:14,320
It'll be a little weird because um, you know, it's not Olr without Loki and dark Sakura

2270
02:57:14,320 --> 02:57:18,000
So I would say it's a spin-off show for the week that might go to the feed

2271
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:21,560
It would actually be a show called Rob goes to PAX or something like that

2272
02:57:21,560 --> 02:57:24,640
And then I don't know what dark soccer and Loki will do. It'll be funny

2273
02:57:24,640 --> 02:57:27,800
I think you guys should just do something fucking random like next week

2274
02:57:27,800 --> 02:57:31,140
Just get together and play a game or something and tape it. It'll be funny

2275
02:57:32,120 --> 02:57:36,640
Anyway, we'll talk about that over the next couple weeks. If you have ideas email mailbag orangeonshorey.com

2276
02:57:36,640 --> 02:57:41,920
Sj100 Matt says I should be using the Twitter when I'm at PAX so they can stalk me abs so fucking lutely

2277
02:57:41,920 --> 02:57:48,640
I'm gonna be on the Twitter you prepare to have your Twitter's flooded with tweets from PAX. I will be doing that on the oil

2278
02:57:48,640 --> 02:57:52,840
I'll be tasteful. Don't worry. It's Sony supposed to be at PAX because maybe we'll get to play the moves stuff

2279
02:57:52,840 --> 02:57:58,360
I believe so. I don't know that the PAX is sold out dude, and I didn't go as media. I signed up

2280
02:57:58,360 --> 02:58:04,720
It's just you know, cuz media packs is really nothing special and I'm purposefully going to be a gamer

2281
02:58:04,720 --> 02:58:06,720
I am NOT going to be a

2282
02:58:07,360 --> 02:58:10,240
Reporter I meant they just might have it to play, you know, like a little bit

2283
02:58:10,240 --> 02:58:13,400
Well, they might they might but it might also be very crowded and hard to get in there to play

2284
02:58:13,400 --> 02:58:15,400
You know what? I mean remember PAX Prime

2285
02:58:15,520 --> 02:58:21,120
We weren't able to really play anything, but that one hour we were in early. That was still fun though. So we'll see

2286
02:58:21,120 --> 02:58:23,580
Yeah, it was fun. It was very fun. All right

2287
02:58:25,560 --> 02:58:30,220
Some folks in chat really like the idea of dark soccer and Loki doing a show without me. Well fine. I see how you are

2288
02:58:30,220 --> 02:58:34,740
SSJ 100 Matt says have Dan here and have him take Skype calls the whole show

2289
02:58:35,380 --> 02:58:39,920
This will be the ring you talk about orange on the radio. Hi. I don't care. Bye

2290
02:58:41,140 --> 02:58:47,540
Shut the fuck up junkie. I like this. I like where this is going replace me with Dan on back tonight

2291
02:58:47,540 --> 02:58:49,620
This is my Dan impersonation. Uh

2292
02:58:50,900 --> 02:58:52,900
What?

2293
02:58:52,900 --> 02:58:57,060
Shut up. I'm saying have a Loki Jamie and Dan show. I think that's actually really funny

2294
02:58:57,060 --> 02:59:03,460
Yeah, replace the gay guy with Dan. That'll be hilarious. But um, actually, I don't know if I should say this now, but there is

2295
02:59:04,180 --> 02:59:06,460
Talks going on for Dan to have a show

2296
02:59:07,620 --> 02:59:10,700
Should I say that? I don't know. Maybe maybe too early too soon

2297
02:59:15,020 --> 02:59:17,780
Yeah, we're thinking about doing something

2298
02:59:20,340 --> 02:59:25,460
Vault related and I will say this much currently it is just an olr

2299
02:59:25,460 --> 02:59:29,780
Project has nothing to do with all games if we can work it in with all games excellent

2300
02:59:29,780 --> 02:59:35,480
But there's so many great shows in all games that weren't planned to do it just to say show that's not live. So we'll see

2301
02:59:36,260 --> 02:59:39,600
More to come and that might not be the only new show coming soon

2302
02:59:42,380 --> 02:59:44,380
All right anyhow

2303
02:59:46,140 --> 02:59:47,980
All right

2304
02:59:47,980 --> 02:59:52,400
So chatters like the idea of a Dan show you better see if Dan's gonna be available packs weekend

2305
02:59:52,400 --> 02:59:57,160
Tell him the chatters demand it. All right, we're gonna wrap shit up. It's time for us to get out of here first

2306
02:59:57,160 --> 03:00:01,080
Oh last-minute stories. I don't know if Loki cleared him out. So any other last-minute stories you guys have

2307
03:00:02,360 --> 03:00:04,360
Kitty youtubes don't count us

2308
03:00:08,400 --> 03:00:12,440
Some more to kind of go back to what we were talking about guitar freaks germania xg

2309
03:00:12,880 --> 03:00:19,040
it's rumored that the extra song apparently is a remix of mechanical rock and

2310
03:00:19,040 --> 03:00:23,560
I guess it's me making it go rock jive and

2311
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:28,880
That's kind of neat and then okay, so some other stuff

2312
03:00:31,680 --> 03:00:36,720
Let's see, there's apparently a new guitar game or I guess a new guitar that's out there

2313
03:00:37,240 --> 03:00:39,280
This is called the power gig guitar

2314
03:00:39,280 --> 03:00:41,920
It is not only a guitar controller

2315
03:00:41,920 --> 03:00:45,760
But it's a real guitar and you can apparently use it with rock band and whatnot

2316
03:00:45,760 --> 03:00:48,880
And you can also plug it into an amp and actually play a real guitar

2317
03:00:50,200 --> 03:00:53,400
No word on what the cost is on it though. Let me see here. I

2318
03:00:54,280 --> 03:00:59,780
Haven't said what the cost is on it yet, but it looks neat. I guess if you want a guitar

2319
03:01:01,120 --> 03:01:04,000
Although I just probably just buy a separate guitar. You know, that's just me

2320
03:01:07,160 --> 03:01:13,400
Then also there's a little bit more tying in with the whole viral campaign that valve has been doing with portal

2321
03:01:13,400 --> 03:01:15,880
apparently during their GDC

2322
03:01:17,360 --> 03:01:20,860
Thing there was a blue screen of death that was created

2323
03:01:21,380 --> 03:01:25,940
and that there was some error code or whatever and apparently if you

2324
03:01:26,780 --> 03:01:30,760
Translate the error code. It says suspended until e3 or ee

2325
03:01:31,260 --> 03:01:36,140
So obviously they're going down something portal twos at e3 da da and da

2326
03:01:37,180 --> 03:01:38,660
exactly

2327
03:01:38,660 --> 03:01:41,740
Also, Battlestar Galactica is apparently getting an MMO

2328
03:01:41,740 --> 03:01:43,740
fracking awesome and

2329
03:01:44,340 --> 03:01:48,540
It's interesting though. It says that it's being developed for sci-fi

2330
03:01:48,540 --> 03:01:54,660
I guess by big point which they've done several titles in the genre, I guess before and

2331
03:01:55,620 --> 03:01:57,620
I guess it'll be

2332
03:01:58,220 --> 03:02:04,620
Coming out this autumn on the sci-fi s website for an exclusive 30-day period then I don't know where it's going from there. I

2333
03:02:05,820 --> 03:02:09,580
Gotta say, you know since we've now finally done what we told the listeners

2334
03:02:09,580 --> 03:02:11,940
We're gonna do for years and we did our fuck show last week

2335
03:02:11,940 --> 03:02:15,480
We might have to do a frack show the week Battlestar Galactica comes out

2336
03:02:16,420 --> 03:02:22,980
I'm just kidding awful. I'm kidding. We'll need we need a new epic show idea. I'm sure one will come up soon enough

2337
03:02:26,740 --> 03:02:34,660
There's still the wheel of wheel of obscenity that I've wheel of obscenity turn turn turn show us the curse word that we should learn

2338
03:02:34,660 --> 03:02:38,660
exactly

2339
03:02:39,300 --> 03:02:41,780
Yeah, and that's pretty much it for now, all right

2340
03:02:42,820 --> 03:02:46,340
That's it. We're gonna do a wrap it up and get on out of here for the night

2341
03:02:46,340 --> 03:02:50,860
It's a good show though is fun. Lots of lots of ground covered tonight considering, you know

2342
03:02:51,140 --> 03:02:53,700
This was the week that Final Fantasy 13 came out

2343
03:02:53,700 --> 03:02:56,420
We did a very good job of talking about a lot of games and not just

2344
03:02:56,540 --> 03:02:59,940
Not just that one tonight because we talked about it all last week amongst the f-words

2345
03:03:00,420 --> 03:03:03,140
But anyhow, thank you guys very much for tuning in and listening

2346
03:03:03,140 --> 03:03:08,060
We really appreciate you guys tuning in and supporting us and and the reviews like I said earlier and all that, you know

2347
03:03:08,060 --> 03:03:11,740
Once again, I always say this we do this show for free because it's fun

2348
03:03:11,740 --> 03:03:14,860
And it's it's like getting the family together to have a good time

2349
03:03:15,180 --> 03:03:19,540
So if you like what you hear all we ask tell a couple people tell one tell two people

2350
03:03:19,540 --> 03:03:23,540
You know about this show help us spread the word and if you're like Rob, I've told everybody

2351
03:03:23,540 --> 03:03:30,480
I can't think of anyone else to tell then please post a review somewhere iTunes the zoom listing podcast alley wherever

2352
03:03:30,480 --> 03:03:36,360
There's plenty of podcasting sites help us spread the word and there's even some folks have gone so far to do forum signatures and stuff

2353
03:03:36,360 --> 03:03:40,960
That is like way more than we could ask for and really appreciate it. Just you know, so thank you very much

2354
03:03:40,960 --> 03:03:47,000
Uh, let's go around and get everybody's final thought. I'll start with my final thought. My final thought is I want a taco again

2355
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:51,920
Yes, it's a Sunday night tradition taco taco taco dark soccer your final thought. I love my kitty

2356
03:03:52,920 --> 03:03:57,080
Yes, there's shirmy youtubes now, huh? Yeah, there's shirmy has two youtubes up

2357
03:03:57,080 --> 03:04:01,640
But I also was watching Maru the cat and that's cute, too

2358
03:04:02,440 --> 03:04:04,720
Loki your final thought tonight two more weeks

2359
03:04:04,720 --> 03:04:10,400
I get to play the rock star staff and grand theft auto 4 and I intend on kicking the crap out of them

2360
03:04:10,400 --> 03:04:12,400
Can't wait. Are you gonna film it somehow?

2361
03:04:12,760 --> 03:04:14,320
You gotta make that happen

2362
03:04:14,320 --> 03:04:18,520
Make it happen. I could do that. I guess make it work. That would be sweet

2363
03:04:18,520 --> 03:04:24,140
But the problem is because they're doing an event because they do these every now and then I always miss them

2364
03:04:24,140 --> 03:04:26,140
But it's actually during my work time

2365
03:04:26,140 --> 03:04:27,820
that

2366
03:04:27,820 --> 03:04:32,300
Happens to take place and it's teams of two that you get to go play against them

2367
03:04:33,300 --> 03:04:34,780
but

2368
03:04:34,780 --> 03:04:40,920
I'm just gonna kick the crap out of them and it's gonna be hilarious. Can't wait. Can't wait. All right

2369
03:04:40,920 --> 03:04:42,780
well, thank you guys very much and

2370
03:04:42,780 --> 03:04:46,100
Tune in next week. We'll be back next week with more orange launch radio

2371
03:04:46,100 --> 03:04:48,980
Jamie may be a little late, but that's not gonna stop the show. So

2372
03:04:49,620 --> 03:04:54,140
We'll be back next week with more orange launch radio. Yes, Jamie. You'll be here. Just late. We all right

2373
03:04:54,140 --> 03:04:56,140
So see you next week guys. Have a great week

2374
03:04:57,060 --> 03:05:03,060
