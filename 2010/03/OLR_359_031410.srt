00:00:14,513 --> 00:00:19,857
[SPEAKER_15]: Tonight, March 14th, 2010, Sony details this new motion controller at GDC.

2
00:00:20,338 --> 00:00:26,123
[SPEAKER_15]: OnLive promises streaming games for a monthly fee, and soon you can get Xbox achievements on your cell phones.

3
00:00:31,806 --> 00:00:39,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, my friends, and welcome to episode number 359 of Orange Lounge Radio, the video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:39,993 --> 00:00:45,837
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

5
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:46,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Woo.

6
00:00:47,118 --> 00:00:47,719
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing?

7
00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:48,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Woo.

8
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:48,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Woo.

9
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,601
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds good.

10
00:00:50,621 --> 00:00:50,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Woo.

11
00:00:51,102 --> 00:00:51,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Woo.

12
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:53,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Not like woo, but woo.

13
00:00:53,864 --> 00:00:55,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Like a Ric Flair kind of woo.

14
00:00:55,265 --> 00:00:55,565
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

15
00:00:55,725 --> 00:00:58,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Also joining us, say hello to TechMasterLoki.

16
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:07,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Who I noticed is eating BBQ chicken Yes, so I have to be sure that I'm not getting chicken At least he has chicken Woo!

17
00:01:07,554 --> 00:01:08,855
[SPEAKER_05]: And BBQ chicken gets a woo?

18
00:01:09,776 --> 00:01:18,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, I'm almost out of root beer and that's not good I got him to put no ice this time so it doesn't water down with that useless frozen water

19
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:21,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Yet no one is eating pie, and today is pie day.

20
00:01:21,402 --> 00:01:23,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy pie day to all of our listeners.

21
00:01:23,703 --> 00:01:24,443
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a donut.

22
00:01:24,983 --> 00:01:25,803
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that counts.

23
00:01:26,023 --> 00:01:27,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I did have something kind of pie-like.

24
00:01:28,164 --> 00:01:28,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

25
00:01:28,504 --> 00:01:29,905
[SPEAKER_11]: Pie-like.

26
00:01:30,385 --> 00:01:38,447
[SPEAKER_11]: I went to Charlie's Cafe and had the banana cream pie waffle.

27
00:01:38,888 --> 00:01:40,008
[SPEAKER_11]: They put pie filling on the waffle.

28
00:01:40,328 --> 00:01:41,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's kind of strange.

29
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:42,049
[SPEAKER_11]: It's delicious.

30
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,330
[SPEAKER_11]: And they put chocolate chips on it too.

31
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,812
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like dessert for breakfast.

32
00:01:45,032 --> 00:01:45,592
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, it was great.

33
00:01:45,612 --> 00:01:47,494
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how some people eat breakfast for dinner?

34
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:51,837
[SPEAKER_11]: But like, I didn't really eat anything like for five hours after that.

35
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:56,821
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it was like full of waffle, waffley pie goodness.

36
00:01:56,881 --> 00:01:57,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Waffle and pie.

37
00:01:57,882 --> 00:01:59,583
[SPEAKER_05]: I can think of no two better foods.

38
00:02:00,323 --> 00:02:01,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless there was bacon somehow involved too.

39
00:02:01,965 --> 00:02:02,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

40
00:02:03,746 --> 00:02:04,306
[SPEAKER_03]: This is funny.

41
00:02:04,606 --> 00:02:04,746
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

42
00:02:04,786 --> 00:02:06,827
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep messing with Cheeseburger in the chat room.

43
00:02:08,387 --> 00:02:09,147
[SPEAKER_03]: He asked me.

44
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:11,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why.

45
00:02:11,368 --> 00:02:11,988
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just funny.

46
00:02:12,728 --> 00:02:13,008
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

47
00:02:13,468 --> 00:02:13,909
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to get it?

48
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:21,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, he was asking me what my email address was, so I'm like, no, you had me confused with the other Loki, just, you know, because there is no other Loki in chat.

49
00:02:22,511 --> 00:02:26,912
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I just... And so he's really confused.

50
00:02:26,932 --> 00:02:29,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but now if he's listening to the show, he's going to know you're messing with him.

51
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:29,432
[SPEAKER_05]: So?

52
00:02:29,873 --> 00:02:30,113
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

53
00:02:30,653 --> 00:02:31,013
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done.

54
00:02:31,773 --> 00:02:38,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if you want to join our chat room and get messed with, too, we do tape live every week at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

55
00:02:38,215 --> 00:02:38,736
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 6 Pacific.

56
00:02:38,756 --> 00:02:43,397
[SPEAKER_05]: A big thank you to them for letting us deal their bandwidth every week, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, of course.

57
00:02:44,518 --> 00:02:48,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Daylight savings happened today, by the way, so we might be on, I think, let's see, We Sprang Forward.

58
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:52,420
[SPEAKER_05]: So those that didn't celebrate it, we would have sprung backwards for them.

59
00:02:52,941 --> 00:02:59,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, if you are listening to us live, pull up a chair and join us in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to be.

60
00:03:00,363 --> 00:03:07,225
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to get into some gaming news here in a little bit, but we always start off, just as we have for the past several years, talking about how was your gaming week?

61
00:03:07,365 --> 00:03:09,606
[SPEAKER_05]: And DarkSakura, what kind of video games have you been playing this week?

62
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:10,706
[SPEAKER_11]: Atari.

63
00:03:11,346 --> 00:03:11,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah?

64
00:03:12,566 --> 00:03:13,787
[SPEAKER_11]: I played Gorf.

65
00:03:15,387 --> 00:03:17,128
[SPEAKER_11]: And I played Tempest 3000.

66
00:03:17,268 --> 00:03:18,068
[SPEAKER_11]: I played Tempest 2000.

67
00:03:18,468 --> 00:03:22,649
[SPEAKER_11]: I played... I'll just go ahead and say it.

68
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:24,910
[SPEAKER_11]: I played Space Harrier on the Atari XL.

69
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:25,950
[SPEAKER_11]: A beta.

70
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:26,530
[SPEAKER_11]: A beta.

71
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:27,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

72
00:03:27,929 --> 00:03:30,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it like a new thing or like a prototype that never happened?

73
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,310
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a new thing.

74
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,590
[SPEAKER_11]: It's in development right now.

75
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,610
[SPEAKER_11]: I met the guy who did the soundtrack.

76
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,290
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, very cool.

77
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,531
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty cool.

78
00:03:38,211 --> 00:03:39,851
[SPEAKER_11]: I played... What else did I play?

79
00:03:39,951 --> 00:03:45,912
[SPEAKER_11]: I played Centipede on the Atari XL with a remapped trackball.

80
00:03:46,812 --> 00:03:47,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Played a little Peggle.

81
00:03:48,373 --> 00:03:51,673
[SPEAKER_11]: Played a lot of... Actually, not really a whole lot of Star Trek Online.

82
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,673
[SPEAKER_11]: I did like a battle.

83
00:03:54,614 --> 00:03:54,794
[SPEAKER_11]: And...

84
00:03:59,133 --> 00:03:59,433
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

85
00:03:59,453 --> 00:04:04,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we'll come back to DarkSakura a little later about all the Atari stuff.

86
00:04:04,656 --> 00:04:10,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan actually got Gradius, the Gradius thing for Wii.

87
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,919
[SPEAKER_05]: The Gradius Rebirth.

88
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:13,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

89
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,180
[SPEAKER_05]: The redone Gradius.

90
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,842
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and so it was fun watching him cuss at the Moai heads.

91
00:04:20,143 --> 00:04:22,004
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I bought that, but I didn't really play enough of it.

92
00:04:22,064 --> 00:04:23,824
[SPEAKER_05]: I got distracted with something else that was going on that week.

93
00:04:23,844 --> 00:04:24,385
[SPEAKER_10]: It's anger-inducing.

94
00:04:24,985 --> 00:04:25,625
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, of course.

95
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

96
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:33,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not too eventful.

97
00:04:33,383 --> 00:04:39,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Final Fantasy XIII, and I'm maybe like six hours into it.

98
00:04:41,105 --> 00:05:07,135
[SPEAKER_03]: and played more Grand Theft Auto and actually part of the week our internet was down at work or our network in the room that we have the 360s in so we ended up playing some old school Saints Row 1 deathmatch multiplayer so that was fun because you can do system link on those and they don't require Xbox Live.

99
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:12,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then I did check out the demo for Just Cause 2.

100
00:05:13,376 --> 00:05:14,037
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty fun.

101
00:05:14,417 --> 00:05:15,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Not as fun as I would hoped.

102
00:05:16,497 --> 00:05:18,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I think I'd like it.

103
00:05:19,298 --> 00:05:23,459
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of got that, um, Mercenaries 2 vibe to it.

104
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,420
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's very similar, obviously, to the first Just Cause game.

105
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,901
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, thankfully it is...

106
00:05:30,702 --> 00:05:34,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, very much higher production value than Mercenaries 2.

107
00:05:34,386 --> 00:05:41,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that game was glitched out every which way possible, so.

108
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I did finish downloading the Blur multiplayer beta.

109
00:05:44,695 --> 00:05:48,539
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played it yet, though, so that'll be pretty fun.

110
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:54,425
[SPEAKER_03]: They're supposed to be adding some more codes for that, so hopefully I'll be able to give you one, Rob, so.

111
00:05:55,174 --> 00:05:56,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I got one.

112
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:57,417
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in the same boat you are.

113
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:58,579
[SPEAKER_05]: I had so much other stuff going on.

114
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:03,005
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was really excited about Blur, too, but I keep... I'll get into it in a minute.

115
00:06:06,761 --> 00:06:09,042
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I think that's really all I played this week.

116
00:06:09,322 --> 00:06:21,665
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried going back to play some more Borderlands, but since I've been modding the hell out of it, I finally downloaded the patch that's supposed to get rid of all that stuff, and it kind of jacked up my game.

117
00:06:21,765 --> 00:06:32,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, now it won't load my save game correctly, and it's not a big deal because I don't really care about the progress in the game or my level or whatever because I've been cheating anyways.

118
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:34,029
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that...

119
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:38,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have to go do all those quests again because it's a lot of just running around.

120
00:06:40,071 --> 00:06:40,751
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really annoying.

121
00:06:41,311 --> 00:06:44,713
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have to go through and get to be fixed again.

122
00:06:45,913 --> 00:06:47,094
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll cheat again.

123
00:06:48,034 --> 00:06:55,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, by the way, I am also cheating through Final Fantasy XIII because you can edit the save games to do all sorts of crazy stuff.

124
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:58,178
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can cheat it or hack it or crack it, Loki's probably done it.

125
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:04,957
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, speaking of hacking and cheating I think Dan wants to talk to you about something related to a Japanese Xbox game.

126
00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:05,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

127
00:07:07,201 --> 00:07:07,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

128
00:07:08,726 --> 00:07:12,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, if that's it for Loki's Gaming Week, then I'll go ahead.

129
00:07:12,387 --> 00:07:22,751
[SPEAKER_05]: My Gaming Week, yeah, like Loki said, I got into the Blur Beta, but sadly I've just been so into Final Fantasy XIII that all of my gaming time has been sucked into Final Fantasy XIII.

130
00:07:23,031 --> 00:07:30,894
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm about 16 hours in at this point, and I get the sense I am right before something epic that's going to happen in the story.

131
00:07:31,414 --> 00:07:33,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I'm not going to give out spoilers.

132
00:07:33,355 --> 00:07:33,855
[SPEAKER_05]: I am very...

133
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:35,615
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

134
00:07:57,463 --> 00:07:58,123
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

135
00:08:24,214 --> 00:08:29,457
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a lot of people played through the first three hours and there's definitely your characters that are likable and dislikable.

136
00:08:29,957 --> 00:08:37,280
[SPEAKER_05]: But the thing that was mentioned last week, the game is like a banana that slowly peels back to reveal all of its layers.

137
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe like an everlasting gobstopper because it takes so long to get through.

138
00:08:40,882 --> 00:08:42,342
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's all these different colored layers.

139
00:08:42,703 --> 00:08:46,985
[SPEAKER_05]: You definitely start to see that there is more to the story than what you saw in the first few hours.

140
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,045
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very interesting.

141
00:08:48,065 --> 00:08:51,787
[SPEAKER_03]: I do like the weapon upgrade system because I was wondering what all those components were for.

142
00:08:51,807 --> 00:08:51,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

143
00:08:52,607 --> 00:09:02,499
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was going to be more of like crafting though, instead of like, okay, these components equal X number of experience and your levels go up and the weapon does more damage or whatever.

144
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,990
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

145
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,002
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to get into it because it's pretty big.

146
00:09:30,022 --> 00:09:36,147
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just wondering if we kill the cyber pope because, you know, he looks like he has it coming.

147
00:09:37,848 --> 00:09:41,752
[SPEAKER_05]: My favorite character, though, I think is still Saz because he does have a chocobo that lives in his hair.

148
00:09:41,852 --> 00:09:46,996
[SPEAKER_05]: And the chocobo gets a little more personality as the story goes on and it's disgustingly cute.

149
00:09:47,236 --> 00:09:48,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Disgustingly cute.

150
00:09:48,697 --> 00:09:52,841
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was going to say that the Shiva sister's

151
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Their motorcycle is naughty.

152
00:09:57,372 --> 00:10:05,758
[SPEAKER_05]: I am so happy that Final Fantasy has gone back to this just epic, over-the-top summons thing in the game.

153
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:11,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to Final Fantasy VII where it was like Knights of the Round and all this...

154
00:10:12,043 --> 00:10:13,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, 10 had it too.

155
00:10:13,444 --> 00:10:14,064
[SPEAKER_05]: It did, it did.

156
00:10:14,084 --> 00:10:14,944
[SPEAKER_05]: There was one.

157
00:10:14,964 --> 00:10:19,406
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 did have the Shiva that would come out and snap her fingers, boop, and then the ice would shatter everywhere.

158
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:20,786
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice to see that again.

159
00:10:20,826 --> 00:10:25,428
[SPEAKER_03]: There was one part, though, of the game that I didn't like, so, I mean, it was kind of annoying, thankfully.

160
00:10:25,448 --> 00:10:30,450
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a really short section of the game, but, you know, they kind of tried to change the gameplay up a little bit.

161
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:38,213
[SPEAKER_03]: When you get that little mech thing that you walk around in for about five, not even five minutes, like two minutes, that was a waste of time.

162
00:10:38,723 --> 00:10:43,287
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see why some people are kind of on Final Fantasy XIII because it does change things up a lot.

163
00:10:43,387 --> 00:10:49,753
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, you don't really go out into this world map and go to towns and stuff like you do in a Final Fantasy game.

164
00:10:49,773 --> 00:10:50,934
[SPEAKER_03]: But you didn't in X either.

165
00:10:51,095 --> 00:10:55,759
[SPEAKER_03]: If you think about it, remember, it was just the airship in different spots that you could kind of drop down into.

166
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:58,280
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of these next-gen games are kind of like that too.

167
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Lost Odyssey.

168
00:10:59,561 --> 00:11:07,686
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot I see besides the battle systems are completely different, but the way you move around the map and everything is very similar to Lost Odyssey.

169
00:11:07,726 --> 00:11:16,811
[SPEAKER_05]: You have these relatively linear dungeons with different branches and so forth, but Lost Odyssey didn't get a lot of crap, but clearly Final Fantasy XIII is.

170
00:11:16,831 --> 00:11:20,853
[SPEAKER_03]: People just have an idea of what they think Final Fantasy should be, and if it's not that

171
00:11:20,953 --> 00:11:21,834
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

172
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:56,620
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw in our chatroom, chat.orangelandreda.com says Sky, he would have to wash his hair every day though to clean out all the Chocobo poo I do want to point out that Chocobo is capable of flying out of the hair and you do see that happening so he hopefully is potty trained to fly out of the hair and go to a nearby tree or something they don't really get into that and normally animals don't poop where they sleep, you know

173
00:11:57,301 --> 00:12:03,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like... You know, there's just some cases where you don't have to explain the bathroom thing.

174
00:12:03,308 --> 00:12:04,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, take 24, for example.

175
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:11,758
[SPEAKER_05]: On the show 24, it's so fast-paced and action-paced, you don't ever stop to really think, when do these characters have time to poo?

176
00:12:12,438 --> 00:12:14,100
[SPEAKER_03]: When they're not showing them, you know?

177
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,463
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, when it goes to some other character.

178
00:12:17,444 --> 00:12:30,947
[SPEAKER_05]: but these are things you don't think about because 24 is so action packed and there's so much going on you're not supposed to be thinking about gee I wonder if Jack's gotta go anyhow are all the scenes always focused on him?

179
00:12:31,946 --> 00:12:32,326
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

180
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Are all the scenes always focused on him?

181
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:34,727
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they're not.

182
00:12:34,827 --> 00:12:40,309
[SPEAKER_05]: So then he pees when... Well, he's usually in situations where it's not like there's a bathroom nearby.

183
00:12:40,449 --> 00:12:41,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Depends, Rob, depends.

184
00:12:41,729 --> 00:12:43,370
[SPEAKER_05]: When he's tied to a chair getting tortured.

185
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:43,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Depends.

186
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:44,770
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, forget it.

187
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:49,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Although that would be awesome to spend a whole episode based on him trying to find a bathroom.

188
00:12:49,052 --> 00:12:50,732
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it would not be awesome, actually.

189
00:12:50,752 --> 00:12:51,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it would.

190
00:12:51,112 --> 00:12:53,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's being canceled, so oh well.

191
00:12:53,753 --> 00:12:56,994
[SPEAKER_05]: No, NBC might buy it now that they have five hours available on weeknights.

192
00:12:57,455 --> 00:12:58,455
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the rumor anyway.

193
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:08,128
[SPEAKER_05]: 24 is a great show, although it's one of those shows where it's like, I missed an episode, so now I can't watch any of it, because you miss one, you miss everything.

194
00:13:08,168 --> 00:13:09,789
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Lost.

195
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:12,271
[SPEAKER_05]: People just obsess with Lost, and I get why.

196
00:13:12,932 --> 00:13:13,753
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot to it.

197
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:19,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, if you missed that first episode, I think you're just lost.

198
00:13:20,618 --> 00:13:20,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Period.

199
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:22,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow.

200
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:28,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just like Brad from PodCulture said, he pees during the commercial break, just like everybody else does.

201
00:13:29,902 --> 00:13:32,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Liquid Parrot in chatroom asks, I'm playing Final Fantasy XIII now.

202
00:13:32,642 --> 00:13:35,263
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting five stars after every battle, but what's the point?

203
00:13:35,703 --> 00:13:37,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there even EXP in this game?

204
00:13:37,704 --> 00:13:43,585
[SPEAKER_05]: There is not EXP, but there's crystal points that let you move around the board, similar to Final Fantasy X's level-up system.

205
00:13:45,165 --> 00:13:47,646
[SPEAKER_05]: The stars, I believe, affect your loot.

206
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,606
[SPEAKER_05]: You can sometimes get loot affected by the stars.

207
00:13:50,906 --> 00:13:58,768
[SPEAKER_05]: I think more importantly, your Technic points, which I don't know if you're to the point in the game where you're using those yet, but they allow you to cast spells like Libra.

208
00:13:59,668 --> 00:14:02,369
[SPEAKER_05]: You will see how that comes into play if you're not already there.

209
00:14:02,469 --> 00:14:05,490
[SPEAKER_05]: The star ratings affect how fast your bar fills up for Technic points.

210
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:06,710
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

211
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, other games.

212
00:14:10,072 --> 00:14:11,012
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I mentioned WoW.

213
00:14:11,052 --> 00:14:11,873
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm playing Warcraft.

214
00:14:11,953 --> 00:14:15,816
[SPEAKER_05]: My boyfriend and I made it to Outlands on the characters we've been working on for a couple months, so yay that.

215
00:14:16,577 --> 00:14:19,499
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Mega Man 10 came out this week on PlayStation.

216
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:21,200
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't play it really a lot.

217
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:27,505
[SPEAKER_05]: I just kind of downloaded it and went in and went, ooh, pretty, and well, not really pretty, but retrotastic.

218
00:14:27,585 --> 00:14:29,626
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went in and watched the replays.

219
00:14:29,847 --> 00:14:31,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Oddly enough, that was the first thing I did.

220
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:35,491
[SPEAKER_05]: I went in to watch replays and watch people just do speedruns on these stages that are insane.

221
00:14:35,831 --> 00:15:04,265
[SPEAKER_05]: that's kind of a cool thing I don't remember if Mega Man 9 had that if it did I just never looked for it but for some reason that jumped right out at me in this Mega Man 10 and that was one of the first things I did so I need to play that a little more it's nice though that I can watch movies on how to beat stages when I don't know what to do so that was pretty much it for my gaming week let's go to some housekeeping Jamie you went to an event today where you played all these Atari games give us a little wrap up on what this was all about

222
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:11,212
[SPEAKER_11]: I went to the Atari Party 2010, which I guess I didn't really know about this before, but apparently they do it every year.

223
00:15:12,113 --> 00:15:18,095
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was basically this kind of house-like structure in Davis.

224
00:15:18,995 --> 00:15:21,316
[SPEAKER_11]: It had a kitchen and a big room, but...

225
00:15:22,176 --> 00:15:24,339
[SPEAKER_11]: They just had Atari systems looked up everywhere.

226
00:15:25,099 --> 00:15:34,871
[SPEAKER_11]: And I met a man named Sal who... I said I was going to mention his thing, but I put my piece of paper with everything on there.

227
00:15:35,792 --> 00:15:36,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Mention it next week.

228
00:15:37,393 --> 00:15:39,674
[SPEAKER_11]: Atlantis Games, I think is what he said it was.

229
00:15:40,854 --> 00:15:42,394
[SPEAKER_11]: I will definitely make a big mention of it.

230
00:15:43,754 --> 00:15:45,495
[SPEAKER_11]: It was really cool.

231
00:15:47,255 --> 00:15:54,397
[SPEAKER_11]: He did soundtracks for a lot of, I guess, new releases or ports of other games.

232
00:15:55,277 --> 00:15:58,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Or releases of prototypes and other ones.

233
00:15:58,537 --> 00:16:00,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now they're working on Outrun and Space Harrier.

234
00:16:01,859 --> 00:16:07,452
[SPEAKER_11]: for the Atari XL, which was a computer version of the 5200.

235
00:16:10,194 --> 00:16:32,113
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny his company's called Atlantis Games if that was the name because Atlantis was one and I thought I looked it up on Wikipedia real quick just to jog my memory I thought Atlantis was one of those big big Atari 2600 games that was really well loved and yeah there's some screenshots here was that one of those a magic game so it had that very unique looking cartridge with like the orange that was a great 2600 game so I don't know if the company is named an ode to that game or what but

236
00:16:32,313 --> 00:16:32,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Axel F Axel F

237
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:04,340
[SPEAKER_05]: and somehow Van Halen's jump usually makes an appearance at some point too.

238
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe he didn't do it, but somebody did.

239
00:17:09,501 --> 00:17:19,124
[SPEAKER_11]: At any rate, they also had this is, because keep in mind my brain's kind of fried from being out so long, but they had the DVD game system.

240
00:17:20,344 --> 00:17:24,565
[SPEAKER_11]: You know how some of the DVDs for a while they were doing like a game system hooked up to it.

241
00:17:24,905 --> 00:17:26,366
[SPEAKER_11]: So they had a version of Tempest 3000.

242
00:17:26,426 --> 00:17:26,526
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

243
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:29,573
[SPEAKER_05]: For the new one, the new one is what it is.

244
00:17:56,866 --> 00:17:57,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

245
00:17:58,888 --> 00:18:08,676
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a DVD system that had enhanced DVD tools in it and 3D video game playability on it.

246
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:16,382
[SPEAKER_11]: So only a few things came out on it, but so far I think just Tempest 3000 is the only real notable.

247
00:18:16,903 --> 00:18:19,585
[SPEAKER_11]: But they had one there and had it hooked up.

248
00:18:20,906 --> 00:18:22,708
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll link a picture of it to the chat room, but that's...

249
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,061
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like an N64 with that controller.

250
00:18:25,161 --> 00:18:26,683
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I thought it was at first.

251
00:18:26,743 --> 00:18:27,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, that's kind of neat.

252
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:31,668
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I looked at it and I was like, oh no, that's a new one, yeah.

253
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:41,056
[SPEAKER_11]: But I played Tempest 3000 and there was actually some video up of Dan playing Tempest 3000 because I recorded stuff with my iPhone.

254
00:18:41,777 --> 00:18:42,918
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you already put it on your YouTube?

255
00:18:42,938 --> 00:18:43,839
[SPEAKER_11]: It's on my YouTube right now.

256
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:45,240
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's on your YouTube channel.

257
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:46,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to give that out publicly or...?

258
00:18:47,322 --> 00:18:49,023
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's OLR DarkSakura.

259
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:51,504
[SPEAKER_11]: Or DarkSakura OLR or something.

260
00:18:51,524 --> 00:18:51,924
[SPEAKER_11]: You know it.

261
00:18:52,184 --> 00:18:52,804
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you find it, Rob?

262
00:18:53,185 --> 00:18:53,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

263
00:18:54,805 --> 00:18:59,587
[SPEAKER_11]: But it eats a lot of battery.

264
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:01,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Your DarkSakura OLR.

265
00:19:01,328 --> 00:19:03,549
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, I did like a couple of sweeps of the party.

266
00:19:03,949 --> 00:19:07,871
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, just, you know, I took a few screens.

267
00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:09,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on, here's Tempest 3000.

268
00:19:09,091 --> 00:19:11,512
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to kind of play this a little bit.

269
00:19:11,572 --> 00:19:12,373
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll hear Dan talking.

270
00:19:13,939 --> 00:19:15,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Who did Tempest 2000?

271
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:19,545
[SPEAKER_02]: But it plays on the DVD players that have you on.

272
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,052
[SPEAKER_05]: We should have got you to put these on the OLR, YouTube.

273
00:19:25,072 --> 00:19:25,572
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all right.

274
00:19:26,073 --> 00:19:27,535
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got the movie files.

275
00:19:27,555 --> 00:19:28,115
[SPEAKER_11]: You can have them.

276
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:28,736
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all right.

277
00:19:29,437 --> 00:19:30,118
[SPEAKER_11]: You can copy them.

278
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:33,850
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just trying to get a look at the game here.

279
00:19:34,511 --> 00:19:36,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I know this doesn't make for great radio, but yeah.

280
00:19:36,953 --> 00:19:37,794
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very blurry.

281
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:38,775
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the problem with it.

282
00:19:38,815 --> 00:19:47,943
[SPEAKER_11]: If this was on HDTV, it would be a lot better, but that's why I still say I prefer Tempest 2000 to Tempest 3000, because Tempest 3000 gives me a headache.

283
00:19:49,164 --> 00:19:51,366
[SPEAKER_05]: The score is gigantic in the corner.

284
00:19:52,347 --> 00:19:53,128
[SPEAKER_11]: The music's the same.

285
00:19:54,089 --> 00:19:56,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine on HDTV, this would be spectacular.

286
00:19:58,348 --> 00:20:02,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, almost makes me want to see a Nuon get added to the gaming vault.

287
00:20:03,392 --> 00:20:05,133
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't imagine if I could find one.

288
00:20:05,173 --> 00:20:06,894
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure they're pretty expensive.

289
00:20:07,855 --> 00:20:08,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

290
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,096
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so sorry.

291
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:11,017
[SPEAKER_05]: I was not aware of Tempest 3000.

292
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:15,981
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say it's one of those things I've heard of before, but I just really haven't seen in motion.

293
00:20:16,121 --> 00:20:18,262
[SPEAKER_10]: I've covered it when I covered Tempest 2000.

294
00:20:18,923 --> 00:20:20,364
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but it's one of those things.

295
00:20:20,924 --> 00:20:24,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Hearing about it and seeing it and playing it are three different things.

296
00:20:25,608 --> 00:20:30,995
[SPEAKER_11]: There were jaguars all over the place in all varieties of Atari systems.

297
00:20:34,248 --> 00:20:56,938
[SPEAKER_11]: It was pretty fun, and I'm actually thinking, I'll find the stuff a little bit later for everybody, but the guy I talked to has an eBay store, and he sells the refurbished Excels for like 70 bucks, which isn't bad, because they're all set up to work with S-Video.

298
00:20:58,338 --> 00:21:03,181
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, and, you know, he sells most of the cartridges that they do for like 30 bucks.

299
00:21:03,201 --> 00:21:05,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, I mean, it is, you know, time and effort went into it.

300
00:21:05,443 --> 00:21:08,085
[SPEAKER_11]: It is pretty much a new version of the game.

301
00:21:08,145 --> 00:21:09,986
[SPEAKER_11]: Except he did Tempest Extreme.

302
00:21:10,046 --> 00:21:11,227
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they did Tempest Extreme.

303
00:21:11,967 --> 00:21:19,052
[SPEAKER_11]: That, because of how much work and everything that went into getting it to run properly, it's actually a 50 buck game.

304
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:23,155
[SPEAKER_11]: But, I've seen it in motion, played it, well worth it.

305
00:21:23,975 --> 00:21:25,276
[SPEAKER_11]: So, it was pretty good.

306
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:27,030
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, the Atari Party.

307
00:21:27,351 --> 00:21:28,311
[SPEAKER_05]: A little local event.

308
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:28,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like fun.

309
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,992
[SPEAKER_11]: And someone had a PlayStation there, and I was like, hey!

310
00:21:32,673 --> 00:21:33,633
[SPEAKER_05]: You're at the Atari Party.

311
00:21:33,853 --> 00:21:36,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, were they playing the Atari Collection maybe on the PlayStation?

312
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:37,035
[SPEAKER_05]: That might be acceptable.

313
00:21:37,055 --> 00:21:37,475
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

314
00:21:37,515 --> 00:21:39,656
[SPEAKER_11]: I just heard the little PlayStation chime.

315
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,217
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, hey, that doesn't belong here.

316
00:21:43,277 --> 00:21:43,958
[SPEAKER_11]: You get that out.

317
00:21:43,998 --> 00:21:44,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Traitor!

318
00:21:45,058 --> 00:21:45,758
[SPEAKER_11]: You get that out.

319
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:48,600
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and they also had one of the...

320
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:59,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, you know, I ran into Neil there, and I didn't get to see it, because I was talking to the XL, the guy, Sal, we were talking about the music and everything.

321
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:07,877
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, since I don't think Neil's ever been on this program, he's an old buddy of mine from, like, junior high school, we've known each other a very long time, and so he goes to some of these nerd things, too.

322
00:22:08,418 --> 00:22:12,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he also does Rocky, a big part of that, and is a big nerd, so...

323
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:12,973
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

324
00:22:12,993 --> 00:22:13,993
[SPEAKER_11]: So, that's pretty cool.

325
00:22:42,409 --> 00:22:43,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of retro love.

326
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,394
[SPEAKER_05]: People still making new games on old systems.

327
00:22:46,494 --> 00:22:47,034
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of funny.

328
00:22:47,255 --> 00:22:50,198
[SPEAKER_11]: And yes, Amiga 777, it was a Jaguar.

329
00:22:50,218 --> 00:22:51,700
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone had a Jaguar CD hooked up too.

330
00:22:52,721 --> 00:22:55,825
[SPEAKER_11]: Iron Soldier was one of the games they were playing, so I was like, eh.

331
00:22:57,206 --> 00:22:57,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever.

332
00:22:58,207 --> 00:23:01,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's other housekeeping tonight.

333
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:03,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't forget to use our Twitter.

334
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:04,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Join us on Twitter.

335
00:23:04,311 --> 00:23:06,412
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be taking Twitter topics a little later in the show.

336
00:23:06,792 --> 00:23:15,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitter.com slash OLR and you also can add us on Facebook, Orange Lounge Radio and we have a live journal community too at Orange Lounge.

337
00:23:15,957 --> 00:23:17,698
[SPEAKER_05]: We have an update from Breslul.

338
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:23,662
[SPEAKER_05]: The USL Madness, the tournament to find the greatest video game of all time is almost over.

339
00:23:23,982 --> 00:23:25,122
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost a done deal.

340
00:23:25,162 --> 00:23:27,644
[SPEAKER_05]: We have an update from Breslul on what's going on on our forums.

341
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,120
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, OLR.

342
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,001
[SPEAKER_13]: This is BreathWall.

343
00:23:31,261 --> 00:23:34,143
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm giving you another update on the Madness Tournament in our form.

344
00:23:34,563 --> 00:23:36,064
[SPEAKER_13]: We're actually down to the Final Four.

345
00:23:36,244 --> 00:23:44,189
[SPEAKER_13]: It's Link to the Past versus Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI versus Ocarina of Time, I'm pretty sure.

346
00:23:44,949 --> 00:23:49,992
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Chrono Trigger versus Link to the Past and Ocarina of Time versus Final Fantasy VI.

347
00:23:50,052 --> 00:23:51,253
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are the final matchups.

348
00:23:52,253 --> 00:23:56,436
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't have that many votes, but both matchups are incredibly close.

349
00:23:57,116 --> 00:24:19,237
[SPEAKER_13]: so be sure to get your votes in tonight if you're listening live if you're listening via the podcast pay attention to the forums because the final matchup will be coming this week and we will have a new winner of the Madness Tournament for more information once again log on to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on forums talk to you guys later, bye bye

350
00:24:19,813 --> 00:24:24,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting matchup in the Final Four because they had two Zelda games somehow made it to the Final Four.

351
00:24:24,174 --> 00:24:27,475
[SPEAKER_05]: But Final Fantasy VI is up against Ocarina of Time.

352
00:24:28,035 --> 00:24:30,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotta tell you, my vote went to Final Fantasy VI.

353
00:24:30,355 --> 00:24:31,855
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of my favorite Final Fantasies.

354
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:34,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably, I don't know if I'd say... I would give it the VI too.

355
00:24:35,436 --> 00:24:40,917
[SPEAKER_05]: And don't get me wrong, I realize I've said my piece on Ocarina of Time and it's still a great, great, great game.

356
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:44,398
[SPEAKER_05]: But Final Fantasy VI is like a great, great, great, great, great game.

357
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,739
[SPEAKER_05]: The other matchup is Link to the Past versus Chrono Trigger.

358
00:24:48,099 --> 00:24:53,242
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally voted for Link to the Past, but I know, of course, Chrono Trigger has this extremely loyal fan base.

359
00:24:53,282 --> 00:24:55,262
[SPEAKER_05]: I really wouldn't be surprised to see that win.

360
00:24:56,803 --> 00:25:02,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, you know, Link to the Past, if I had a Super Nintendo sitting in front of me and both of those cards, I'd reach for Link to the Past.

361
00:25:02,606 --> 00:25:02,906
[SPEAKER_05]: I would.

362
00:25:03,806 --> 00:25:06,747
[SPEAKER_05]: I would probably play through more of that in one sitting than I could Chrono Trigger 2.

363
00:25:06,987 --> 00:25:09,207
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, it doesn't really matter what I think.

364
00:25:09,347 --> 00:25:10,768
[SPEAKER_05]: It's what you guys think.

365
00:25:10,808 --> 00:25:12,288
[SPEAKER_05]: So go check that out in our forums.

366
00:25:12,348 --> 00:25:13,628
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have more updates on the winner.

367
00:25:13,648 --> 00:25:16,029
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you don't like the games that are there, we'll poo on you.

368
00:25:16,089 --> 00:25:20,390
[SPEAKER_05]: You should have been voting or sending your top 25 list like we told you to a couple months ago.

369
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,231
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you missed your chance this year, don't worry.

370
00:25:22,251 --> 00:25:23,831
[SPEAKER_05]: You get to do it all again next year.

371
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:24,851
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

372
00:25:27,212 --> 00:25:27,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

373
00:25:29,373 --> 00:25:32,294
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100, Matt in our chat says Ocarina isn't a Link to the Past.

374
00:25:32,435 --> 00:25:32,935
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

375
00:25:33,415 --> 00:25:36,417
[SPEAKER_05]: But Link to the Past did have an Ocarina in it if I remember right, didn't it?

376
00:25:36,637 --> 00:25:39,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't it one of the early ones where you, or at least it had like a whistle type thing.

377
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:40,979
[SPEAKER_05]: It had like some sort of whistle.

378
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:41,920
[SPEAKER_05]: That looked like an Ocarina.

379
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,022
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of like a really, really old creation of that.

380
00:25:45,162 --> 00:25:45,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow.

381
00:25:46,022 --> 00:25:46,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Game Developers Conference

382
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Majesco is now being threatened by Nasdaq with a delisting.

383
00:26:08,102 --> 00:26:13,888
[SPEAKER_03]: The company now has 180 calendar days to bring its stock price above $1 per share, the minimum required to remain on the exchange.

384
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:42,085
[SPEAKER_03]: The trick is, though, that it can't just pop up its fiscally hurting head above a buck for a day and everything will be fine.

385
00:26:42,105 --> 00:26:50,588
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to stay above the $1 mark, I guess, for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days prior to August 30, 2010.

386
00:26:53,607 --> 00:26:59,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if you think about it, Majeska hasn't released much for a while.

387
00:26:59,415 --> 00:27:02,759
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, really their big franchise right now is Cooking Mama.

388
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,364
[SPEAKER_05]: And Cooking Mama's what, like Gardening Mama?

389
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:09,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they've kind of dug that into the ground, haven't they?

390
00:27:10,097 --> 00:27:13,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, it's... They've got a few games coming out.

391
00:27:13,318 --> 00:27:16,618
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, like, there's Pirates of Plunder are supposed to be coming out soon.

392
00:27:16,658 --> 00:27:17,518
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, come on.

393
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:23,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Between Pirates of Plunder, Flips Twisted World, you know, a bunch of these secondary titles there for the Wii.

394
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,121
[SPEAKER_03]: And, yes, I just don't... I don't really see this happening.

395
00:27:29,521 --> 00:27:32,921
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they don't have any big... They put out the Mad Dog McCree pack on Wii.

396
00:27:33,722 --> 00:27:34,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, whoa!

397
00:27:35,142 --> 00:27:35,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Well...

398
00:27:36,683 --> 00:27:37,143
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

399
00:28:01,617 --> 00:28:04,138
[SPEAKER_05]: The BloodRayne games, but again, those are kind of old news.

400
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:05,638
[SPEAKER_05]: They haven't been doing a whole lot these days.

401
00:28:05,678 --> 00:28:12,640
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they've only really been doing DS and Wii titles, and they've been very secondary, I'm sorry to say.

402
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:22,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, the last few games that come out from them... Okay, Data East Arcade Classics Collection.

403
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:30,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a nice collection of games, but it's not going to sell the copies that they need to make money.

404
00:28:30,423 --> 00:28:35,286
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's just... No AAA title, or even really A titles.

405
00:28:35,486 --> 00:28:36,247
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of C titles.

406
00:28:36,307 --> 00:28:37,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me put it this way.

407
00:28:37,948 --> 00:28:43,211
[SPEAKER_03]: A company like 505 Games, I mean, they're pretty brand new.

408
00:28:43,371 --> 00:28:48,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're relatively new, like a few years old, and they put out a lot of crap.

409
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:56,379
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're putting out more games than these guys are, and they actually have some decent titles coming up that are pretty notable, like Naughty Bear or something like that.

410
00:28:56,479 --> 00:28:59,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they may not also be traded on the stock market either.

411
00:28:59,501 --> 00:29:04,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep in mind that we're not talking about if they get delisted from the stock market, they're going to just go under immediately.

412
00:29:05,044 --> 00:29:08,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Although that's sometimes a side effect.

413
00:29:08,466 --> 00:29:10,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Atari's still kicking.

414
00:29:11,728 --> 00:29:13,929
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, not as much as they used to, but they're kicking.

415
00:29:14,409 --> 00:29:17,231
[SPEAKER_03]: They're kicking with the floaties and their, you know, kickboard.

416
00:29:17,271 --> 00:29:20,593
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just, it's not what it was.

417
00:29:20,613 --> 00:29:24,856
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Midway, they went under and all their assets got bought out.

418
00:29:25,536 --> 00:29:27,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Majesco, I could see that happening.

419
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,919
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, Gardening Mama, that could be something.

420
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, like, you know, the Cooking Mama series.

421
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:35,903
[SPEAKER_03]: That could be something that would probably fit with, like, Ubisoft even or something.

422
00:29:35,923 --> 00:29:37,665
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100Matt makes an excellent point in our chat room.

423
00:29:37,945 --> 00:29:39,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Chat.orange.com.

424
00:29:39,186 --> 00:29:44,249
[SPEAKER_05]: They should have brought President Cat over before they go under because President Cat would be a AAA title.

425
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:45,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Indeed.

426
00:29:47,133 --> 00:29:47,533
[SPEAKER_05]: It would.

427
00:29:47,814 --> 00:29:49,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold out hope for E3 at Majesco's booth.

428
00:29:49,837 --> 00:29:50,337
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know.

429
00:29:50,417 --> 00:29:50,878
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know.

430
00:29:52,861 --> 00:29:59,610
[SPEAKER_05]: If President Cat does show up at E3, I will be going over to the booth of the person who had the balls to put it out saying, would you like to shake my hand?

431
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:05,051
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be all sorts of crazy.

432
00:30:06,332 --> 00:30:12,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, by the way, like they did with E3 last year, Nintendo's press conference.

433
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:15,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, by the way, here's a Metroid Other M trailer.

434
00:30:15,337 --> 00:30:22,541
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, oh, by the way, I think we have a candidate for a perfect title this holiday season.

435
00:30:23,062 --> 00:30:25,283
[SPEAKER_05]: This election season, we have the candidate for you.

436
00:30:27,236 --> 00:30:30,239
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

437
00:30:48,735 --> 00:30:50,056
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

438
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:24,213
[SPEAKER_05]: and then there's been a lot of the little thing that they were doing their conference talking about SOCOM 4 because SOCOM is going to be the big franchise that gets the support of PlayStation Move this year and I noticed they went out of their way to say look how you don't go flailing about

439
00:31:24,773 --> 00:31:28,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, they really kind of tried to poke fun at the weed very subtly.

440
00:31:28,775 --> 00:31:30,476
[SPEAKER_05]: They said, notice how he's not flailing about.

441
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:32,217
[SPEAKER_05]: He made these very subtle motions.

442
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:36,179
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got to say, granted, I'm not a SOCOM player, so I didn't really know what to look for.

443
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:38,180
[SPEAKER_05]: But you could see the dude sitting there.

444
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:47,005
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it was a live demo, which I have no reason to doubt that it was, it looked pretty, yeah, he's just kind of using it as another way to control the game.

445
00:31:47,967 --> 00:31:51,071
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's just like the Call of Duty games that are on the Wii.

446
00:31:51,131 --> 00:31:54,495
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it can be done.

447
00:31:54,555 --> 00:32:01,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can just use the one controller as a pointer and then the other one to kind of control your movements.

448
00:32:02,124 --> 00:32:08,251
[SPEAKER_03]: And then maybe throw in some different motion-sensitive commands that you can do for different things.

449
00:32:08,351 --> 00:32:12,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I know they were trying to really make it a point, too, to say, look at the precision.

450
00:32:12,574 --> 00:32:14,235
[SPEAKER_05]: This thing has great precision.

451
00:32:14,295 --> 00:32:16,376
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a precise controller.

452
00:32:16,396 --> 00:32:21,059
[SPEAKER_05]: They were really trying to take a jab at the fact that we can sometimes be a little all over the place.

453
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:22,099
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do agree.

454
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:23,480
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably going to be more precise.

455
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they've had more time to perfect the technology.

456
00:32:26,242 --> 00:32:26,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

457
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:33,126
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, from what their showings were of what they're going to be putting out, come on.

458
00:32:33,946 --> 00:32:35,827
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not that much better than Nintendo.

459
00:32:35,907 --> 00:32:36,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, for example...

460
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:39,031
[SPEAKER_03]: iPad Move Party

461
00:32:53,869 --> 00:32:54,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

462
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:55,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, great.

463
00:32:55,471 --> 00:32:56,792
[SPEAKER_05]: More party game collections.

464
00:32:56,852 --> 00:32:57,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

465
00:32:57,553 --> 00:32:57,994
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, though?

466
00:32:58,054 --> 00:32:59,916
[SPEAKER_05]: If that's what sells, that's what sells.

467
00:32:59,976 --> 00:33:00,376
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

468
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:08,145
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't have a problem with them doing that because it's kind of neat to see that kind of a party game with actually good graphics in it.

469
00:33:08,205 --> 00:33:08,705
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

470
00:33:09,306 --> 00:33:09,426
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

471
00:33:10,487 --> 00:33:16,129
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be neat if they actually figure out unique ways to do this, but dude, they've got an archery game in there.

472
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:20,430
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like the fucking archery game in Wii Sports Resort.

473
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:22,531
[SPEAKER_05]: But in HD.

474
00:33:22,811 --> 00:33:23,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares?

475
00:33:23,371 --> 00:33:26,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, to be fair, there's a Lord of the Rings game coming too, for what it's worth.

476
00:33:26,752 --> 00:33:29,273
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a port of a Wii game and looks like it.

477
00:33:30,153 --> 00:33:34,676
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they did make sure to stress that they had so many companies behind it.

478
00:33:34,716 --> 00:33:37,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they showed a slide where there was just logos all over.

479
00:33:37,898 --> 00:33:44,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much all their big publishers are jumping on board with Move somehow, which isn't too big of a surprise, honestly.

480
00:33:45,363 --> 00:33:48,364
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll just be interesting to see if there's that must-have game.

481
00:33:48,805 --> 00:33:51,406
[SPEAKER_05]: There's that must-have game that really sells the move.

482
00:33:51,566 --> 00:33:53,046
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if SOCOM 4 is it.

483
00:33:53,406 --> 00:34:01,050
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, SOCOM 4, don't get me wrong, SOCOM 4, there's a lot of SOCOM fans, and especially because they've made it a point to say you don't have to use move if you don't want to.

484
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,690
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just something that's there, too.

485
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:06,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, and I like how they do have the option there, and options are good.

486
00:34:07,292 --> 00:34:11,734
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised Sony's jumping on that bandwagon because that wasn't really something that was their mantra.

487
00:34:12,054 --> 00:34:20,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Socom isn't really that title that has crossed the line to get everybody interested, including the soccer moms, which are important because it's their credit card usually with the kids.

488
00:34:21,961 --> 00:34:22,562
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be neat.

489
00:34:23,002 --> 00:34:31,508
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the PlayStation Move party stuff will be okay, especially if they're going to bundle that with the software.

490
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:45,551
[SPEAKER_03]: But my thing is though too, is you gotta buy, you know, at least one of these is gonna come with your kit or whatever that's gonna have the camera, which I don't even really need this because I have the camera already.

491
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:47,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

492
00:35:02,932 --> 00:35:03,953
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what are your thoughts on Move?

493
00:35:03,993 --> 00:35:04,594
[SPEAKER_03]: What's with the lightbulb?

494
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:29,242
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's to be able to see the different players and where they are in the room type of thing.

495
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:32,427
[SPEAKER_03]: That and because it's something that the camera can track.

496
00:35:33,228 --> 00:35:34,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, because it's all camera based.

497
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:39,918
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why they have little glowing balls on people when they're motion capturing them and stuff like that.

498
00:35:41,819 --> 00:35:42,159
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

499
00:35:42,279 --> 00:35:43,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I'm kind of torn.

500
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:47,081
[SPEAKER_05]: I look at PlayStation Move and I go, oh, okay, neat.

501
00:35:47,301 --> 00:35:48,401
[SPEAKER_05]: I like what Sony's doing with that.

502
00:35:48,421 --> 00:35:54,663
[SPEAKER_05]: But then I look at it and go, eh, but there's nothing that's going to make me run out and buy this day one right now.

503
00:35:54,763 --> 00:35:56,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I'm not really the SOCOM fan.

504
00:35:56,663 --> 00:35:57,704
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't really speak to me.

505
00:35:58,424 --> 00:35:58,844
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

506
00:35:58,884 --> 00:36:02,745
[SPEAKER_05]: These minigame collections don't look anything better than the Wii except maybe the graphics.

507
00:36:02,765 --> 00:36:05,326
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing that makes me go, OMG, got to get one of these day one.

508
00:36:05,346 --> 00:36:05,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the problem.

509
00:36:06,526 --> 00:36:08,947
[SPEAKER_03]: is that they haven't figured out why they're not selling as well.

510
00:36:09,227 --> 00:36:15,349
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really what it comes down to is they think, oh my god, it's because this other console has motion sensitive stuff.

511
00:36:15,649 --> 00:36:16,589
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it's selling well.

512
00:36:16,669 --> 00:36:19,770
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's because it has casual games and games that appeal to families.

513
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:20,811
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it's selling well.

514
00:36:22,011 --> 00:36:23,251
[SPEAKER_11]: I just think it's too little too late.

515
00:36:24,172 --> 00:36:25,572
[SPEAKER_05]: You think they're jumping into this too late?

516
00:36:26,292 --> 00:36:27,273
[SPEAKER_11]: Heck yeah.

517
00:36:27,473 --> 00:36:31,694
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I think that Microsoft has the better idea, you know.

518
00:36:32,577 --> 00:36:39,163
[SPEAKER_03]: But basically what they're trying to do with this is that they're trying to put themselves on equal footing with the Nintendo Wii.

519
00:36:39,543 --> 00:36:44,387
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically then it's going to be, okay, look, both of these systems have the motion technology.

520
00:36:44,848 --> 00:36:47,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let's compare the rest of the features.

521
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:53,235
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you compare the rest of the features, the Wii just looks like something from the last generation.

522
00:36:53,255 --> 00:36:59,160
[SPEAKER_05]: The minute this thing comes out, there will be that bundle that includes Move that they're really going to be pushing the holiday season.

523
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, it's a Blu-ray and a Wii type thing in one.

524
00:37:03,102 --> 00:37:04,303
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it is.

525
00:37:04,483 --> 00:37:05,904
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Sony's strategy, I'm sure.

526
00:37:05,984 --> 00:37:07,284
[SPEAKER_05]: It does everything.

527
00:37:07,545 --> 00:37:08,905
[SPEAKER_05]: It only does everything.

528
00:37:10,326 --> 00:37:11,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Except on the leap years.

529
00:37:12,087 --> 00:37:15,929
[SPEAKER_05]: To be fair, Sony's made a lot of ground in the past couple years.

530
00:37:15,989 --> 00:37:17,650
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they've got to do this.

531
00:37:18,311 --> 00:37:19,912
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still way behind in the numbers.

532
00:37:21,994 --> 00:37:23,395
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good idea, but here's the other thing.

533
00:37:23,656 --> 00:37:28,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Even with Natal, Natal's going to be the same problem, I think, even to a greater extent.

534
00:37:28,842 --> 00:37:34,108
[SPEAKER_03]: At least with Natal, and I'll give him credit for this, at least with Natal, I don't have to fucking buy $320 worth of controllers.

535
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:36,771
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the camera.

536
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:37,571
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

537
00:37:37,912 --> 00:37:38,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Done.

538
00:37:38,452 --> 00:37:41,134
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have to make any more fucking purchases at all.

539
00:37:51,843 --> 00:38:01,191
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they're basically stating that they're going to have the full lineup of the Natal titles at E3, which will be cool.

540
00:38:02,092 --> 00:38:12,180
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, they've got EA, Capcom, Turn 10, Spawn Point behind them, and that they are, quote, putting their best people on the job.

541
00:38:13,201 --> 00:38:18,605
[SPEAKER_11]: So they should actually be seeing some pretty good stuff this June.

542
00:38:19,386 --> 00:38:22,387
[SPEAKER_05]: What big Xbox franchise do you think might Natal be?

543
00:38:22,447 --> 00:38:24,307
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I guess we've heard Fable already.

544
00:38:24,707 --> 00:38:36,949
[SPEAKER_05]: But my thought, and I remember making this prediction earlier in the year, and I don't remember if it was on the show or on one of the forums or what have you, but I remember saying, I think Gears of War 3 is going to be unveiled at E3, and it's going to have Natal support.

545
00:38:37,249 --> 00:38:45,971
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's kind of funny that SOCOM showed up with the PlayStation move, because when I saw that, I was like, wow, that's kind of close-ish.

546
00:38:46,071 --> 00:38:47,751
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like PlayStation's kind of...

547
00:38:48,371 --> 00:39:13,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Shootery type game As long as they take a mature approach with it Like, you know, where it makes sense for the game Not just, it seems tacked on And you're not flailing about like an idiot But they, I mean, Sony made a big point to say You will not flail around like an idiot So if they do it right Again, I'm talking out my ass It just seems like it's odd to me We have heard nothing about Gears of War 3 I have this strange feeling

548
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:37,667
[SPEAKER_05]: you know it's going to happen those games are huge sellers I have this strange feeling that's the elephant behind the curtain that's going to show at E3 when DarkSakura talks about they're bringing all their Natal titles my gut tells me that's one of them I'm also though looking in terms of course there's going to be sports games that are going to use it although I would like to see how it would work with like a racing game if it would be something like you foresee you know what I mean

549
00:39:38,666 --> 00:39:39,506
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

550
00:39:59,995 --> 00:40:18,511
[SPEAKER_05]: granted the technology has come a long way in the past few years I just really hope we see that and I hope at E3 they show Natal in a realistic environment and not against a really well lit white wall although you know that's what they're going to do so that it's super uber responsive because part of me is like how's this really going to work in my living room

551
00:40:19,051 --> 00:40:20,751
[SPEAKER_11]: I want them to do it in front of a big red wall.

552
00:40:21,531 --> 00:40:22,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Or a blue wall.

553
00:40:22,372 --> 00:40:25,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Or a tacky curtain out of the 1970s like you'd see in my house.

554
00:40:25,352 --> 00:40:30,613
[SPEAKER_11]: Or like, remember the Wii demo stations I had up at E3 that year with the couch?

555
00:40:31,733 --> 00:40:33,134
[SPEAKER_11]: They just made little living rooms.

556
00:40:33,234 --> 00:40:34,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't they do something like that?

557
00:40:34,654 --> 00:40:35,654
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping that's what we see.

558
00:40:35,814 --> 00:40:36,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I don't know.

559
00:40:37,354 --> 00:40:38,215
[SPEAKER_05]: E3 is a couple months away.

560
00:40:38,315 --> 00:40:40,155
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know if I'm going at this point, to be honest.

561
00:40:40,175 --> 00:40:41,835
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to go, but I don't know.

562
00:40:41,935 --> 00:40:43,796
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to, but I have other priorities this year.

563
00:40:44,096 --> 00:40:44,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, not this year.

564
00:40:47,193 --> 00:40:53,300
[SPEAKER_03]: I just... Really, the only thing that I think right now is an advantage for them is that I don't have to buy extra accessories.

565
00:40:53,980 --> 00:41:02,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, really, that's going to be just like... And that's going to be a big... I hope they push that as, okay, hey, look, you got to buy $320 worth of crap.

566
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:06,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, I'm throwing these numbers out my ass, but, I mean, look at the Wii.

567
00:41:06,854 --> 00:41:08,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Lesser technology, same price.

568
00:41:10,922 --> 00:41:19,389
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I gotta buy all this kind of extra stuff to get it to work versus it's camera, it's done, you just plug it in and go.

569
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:23,952
[SPEAKER_03]: You are the controller, you know, that's it.

570
00:41:24,373 --> 00:41:26,374
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again, since I am the controller...

571
00:41:27,535 --> 00:41:28,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

572
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,942
[SPEAKER_03]: But if they think of some really cool ways to like, you know, play first person shooters somehow, more power to them.

573
00:41:56,883 --> 00:41:57,543
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we'll see.

574
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,044
[SPEAKER_05]: E3's a little ways off.

575
00:41:59,144 --> 00:42:03,085
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, I think Microsoft's going to have that same approach as Sony come the holiday season.

576
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:06,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's the Xbox 360 with Natal or whatever they call it.

577
00:42:06,787 --> 00:42:08,328
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean... It's not going to be Natal.

578
00:42:08,908 --> 00:42:09,929
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to be that either.

579
00:42:09,989 --> 00:42:12,010
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of weird they still have not announced the name.

580
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,751
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guess they could still do it at E3.

581
00:42:13,771 --> 00:42:15,932
[SPEAKER_03]: So they didn't announce the name until they announced the name.

582
00:42:16,292 --> 00:42:19,934
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny... I get it, but E3 is rubbing up a little closer.

583
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,235
[SPEAKER_03]: You know why they named it Move, right?

584
00:42:21,355 --> 00:42:22,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they couldn't get the trademark for Ark.

585
00:42:23,136 --> 00:42:23,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, really?

586
00:42:23,757 --> 00:42:23,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

587
00:42:24,857 --> 00:42:25,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Who had a trademark?

588
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:32,023
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some issue with them not being able to get the trademark, so they had to go with Move instead.

589
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:34,004
[SPEAKER_03]: I think PlayStation Move's a better name.

590
00:42:34,925 --> 00:42:39,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Because their logo's still the Ark, but it's an A-looking thing.

591
00:42:40,689 --> 00:42:43,151
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of think it's the better name for the mass market.

592
00:42:43,691 --> 00:42:44,952
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again, what do I know?

593
00:42:45,072 --> 00:42:45,613
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wii.

594
00:42:46,513 --> 00:42:49,095
[SPEAKER_05]: What a dumb name that was, and yet it worked.

595
00:42:49,115 --> 00:42:50,917
[SPEAKER_11]: I told you why it worked.

596
00:42:51,677 --> 00:42:53,719
[SPEAKER_11]: Simple, easy to remember, easy to market.

597
00:42:54,459 --> 00:43:00,840
[SPEAKER_05]: They made it into an adjective for games, like to Xerox something or to get a Kleenex.

598
00:43:01,321 --> 00:43:05,481
[SPEAKER_05]: They made the Wii just like how people used to say... I'm going to go Wii.

599
00:43:05,521 --> 00:43:06,822
[SPEAKER_11]: No, Wii is not a generic yet.

600
00:43:07,262 --> 00:43:10,863
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I know it's not a generic, but it's got that household recognition.

601
00:43:11,703 --> 00:43:15,564
[SPEAKER_11]: It'd be like Bounty for paper towels.

602
00:43:16,464 --> 00:43:16,704
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

603
00:43:18,044 --> 00:43:21,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on with some more gaming news that maybe don't involve motion.

604
00:43:22,603 --> 00:43:24,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it might, but we never know.

605
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:25,587
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true, that's true.

606
00:43:26,748 --> 00:43:27,849
[SPEAKER_03]: That was something they were talking about.

607
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:33,776
[SPEAKER_03]: But apparently, though, it has been announced that Rockman 3 will be making its way out this holiday season.

608
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:36,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a big surprise.

609
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,742
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they took kind of a year off.

610
00:43:39,264 --> 00:43:40,105
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

611
00:43:59,786 --> 00:44:04,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Green Day Rock Band which has now been announced to be releasing on June 8th worldwide.

612
00:44:06,133 --> 00:44:10,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Also on the three major platforms Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii.

613
00:44:10,838 --> 00:44:14,582
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course we'll use up to six players, three mics, three instruments.

614
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,044
[SPEAKER_03]: And they will also have...

615
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:24,808
[SPEAKER_03]: and apparently the ability to import the tracks as well or export the tracks in the Rock Band 2 as well.

616
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:31,110
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be all 47 tracks that are in the game will be exportable for I guess $10.

617
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:37,652
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's basically Beatles Rock Band but now with Green Day and you can export the tracks.

618
00:44:37,712 --> 00:44:42,954
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even see it as this release to me is not even as big as Beatles Rock Band.

619
00:44:43,054 --> 00:44:45,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is more like Guitar Hero Metallica.

620
00:44:47,202 --> 00:45:16,890
[SPEAKER_05]: but at least you can export the tracks can't do that shit with Metallica or Beatles to be fair or Van Halen yeah or Beatles but Beatles that was a different situation Beatles kinda Beatles are in a little category of their own too you know Beatles is there's not a lot of bands that can get away with just being in their own bubble the music game genre but Beatles can Green Day don't think they're there yet but this this is this will be nice for them they have I mean they have a lot of easily recognizable songs that you know I think the export feature will be very popular too

621
00:45:17,611 --> 00:45:28,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and also they said that there's going to be a special edition Green Day Rock Band Plus that will come, I guess, to Xbox 360 and PS3 for $69.99.

622
00:45:28,521 --> 00:45:40,051
[SPEAKER_03]: It includes fancier packaging and an export feature, I guess a voucher to export the discs to the hard drive, and six previously released Green Day DLC tracks.

623
00:45:41,452 --> 00:45:50,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft in our chatroom, chat.orange.radio.com says, also, George Harrison's son already said that there would be a Rock Band 3 and it will help you learn to play real instruments.

624
00:45:50,682 --> 00:45:54,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't that be interesting if that's kind of the tie-in is more making it real?

625
00:45:55,427 --> 00:45:55,808
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

626
00:45:57,089 --> 00:45:59,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Part of me says maybe there should be a new instrument.

627
00:46:00,052 --> 00:46:28,291
[SPEAKER_05]: but then I think it came up a couple months ago on the show I think the idea had come up that maybe what Rock Band 3 is going to introduce is something like the SingStar space where you upload your own stuff to like a YouTube-y type of site my gut tells me that's going to be Rock Band 3's thing especially with the network taking off as it is and so forth I think Rock Band 3 is going to be really about now you can watch your friends rock out from across the country all I gotta say man is by the time that comes out I mean

628
00:46:29,071 --> 00:46:48,677
[SPEAKER_03]: it's ridiculous the amount of tracks you can have you can have like about over a thousand tracks right now that are in that game I mean that's the way you do a music game right there you have the download content I mean literally there's a whole library of stuff to pick from and you can just keep taking it with you through each and you know reiteration of the game

629
00:46:50,313 --> 00:46:50,633
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

630
00:46:51,034 --> 00:46:53,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, moving on to other news, kind of a follow-up to last week.

631
00:46:53,735 --> 00:46:57,558
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, obviously last week we had a very fun show here at OLR while the Oscars were going on.

632
00:46:57,878 --> 00:47:04,663
[SPEAKER_05]: But something else that was going on at the time was that Ubisoft games were unplayable because their whole service was down.

633
00:47:05,464 --> 00:47:13,669
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently, and I think I had suggested this when somebody said it on the show, it was indeed a DOS attack, it sounds like.

634
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:14,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Hackers went in.

635
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:15,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Servers were attacked.

636
00:47:15,831 --> 00:47:16,711
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

637
00:47:46,201 --> 00:47:52,724
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, just kind of goes to show how their DRM system is ridiculous and was already cracked as we talked about last week, correct?

638
00:47:53,004 --> 00:47:53,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

639
00:47:53,284 --> 00:47:56,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's the code in there that's very similar to Steam.

640
00:47:57,186 --> 00:48:04,769
[SPEAKER_05]: If Steam ever goes bankrupt, which I don't think they're going to anytime soon, but if Steam were to ever go under, all those games would have to be activated without Steam's presence.

641
00:48:05,229 --> 00:48:07,110
[SPEAKER_05]: And Ubisoft's games have something similar.

642
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:11,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone found it and went, bink, and unlocked that for everybody.

643
00:48:11,311 --> 00:48:12,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, what's this button do?

644
00:48:12,332 --> 00:48:12,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

645
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:14,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, there it is.

646
00:48:15,353 --> 00:48:19,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Togak in our chatroom says, haha, I hope they get DDoSed more so they learn their lesson.

647
00:48:20,779 --> 00:48:28,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I'm really an advocate of DDoSing, but I think this certainly shows the weakness of why this should have never been done in the first place.

648
00:48:28,687 --> 00:48:28,887
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

649
00:48:31,385 --> 00:48:35,288
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, how about something that's a little bit less irritating?

650
00:48:36,469 --> 00:48:37,070
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think, Rob?

651
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:37,731
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

652
00:48:38,451 --> 00:48:38,912
[SPEAKER_11]: Akira Yamaoka.

653
00:48:38,932 --> 00:48:40,893
[SPEAKER_11]: He's less irritating.

654
00:48:40,933 --> 00:48:41,694
[SPEAKER_11]: Good to hear about him.

655
00:48:41,754 --> 00:48:42,715
[SPEAKER_05]: He is less irritating.

656
00:48:42,735 --> 00:48:43,956
[SPEAKER_05]: What's he up to lately?

657
00:48:44,556 --> 00:48:54,405
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice to hear him on a video game podcast because, you know, when he left Konami, there was a little worry that, oh, he's leaving to go start a band or do something not to do with games whatsoever.

658
00:48:54,425 --> 00:48:54,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

659
00:48:54,790 --> 00:49:01,836
[SPEAKER_11]: We did a panel at Game Developers Conference talking about as long as audio is fun, the game will be too.

660
00:49:02,697 --> 00:49:03,857
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what it was called.

661
00:49:04,938 --> 00:49:09,242
[SPEAKER_11]: But he was talking about how the audio, how the music goes into...

662
00:49:11,103 --> 00:49:14,185
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's quoted as saying, when there's no sound, the brain fills in the gap.

663
00:49:41,884 --> 00:49:52,053
[SPEAKER_11]: and then actually went to play some music with gaps of silence and then went back in and added sharp sounds to it, of course, which freaked people out.

664
00:49:52,973 --> 00:49:55,035
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think it's very effective.

665
00:49:56,196 --> 00:49:58,638
[SPEAKER_11]: And then he played some guitar for everybody to chill them out.

666
00:50:00,059 --> 00:50:26,305
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see that because that's kind of Silent Hill's thing is that sometimes it'll be very quiet when you're walking around all you hear those footsteps that I'm sure are off sync like he talks about there you walk around with the footsteps and all of a sudden you start hearing the radio noise the very uncomfortable kind of noise and that's how you know something's up interesting to kind of hear the science behind that it's simple psychology I mean they even you know I remember back in the day when I took music theory

667
00:50:27,887 --> 00:50:28,548
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

668
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:51,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, there's a whole science behind it.

669
00:50:51,649 --> 00:50:54,370
[SPEAKER_05]: No word though about sadly what he's working on now or what have you?

670
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:55,731
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

671
00:50:55,751 --> 00:51:00,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't there some rumor or something that came up a while back that he was in cahoots with EA doing something?

672
00:51:00,853 --> 00:51:03,074
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say that had come up on the show like a while ago.

673
00:51:03,114 --> 00:51:04,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe one of the chatters wants to fill in.

674
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:09,657
[SPEAKER_05]: I seriously think though we haven't heard the last of him in games, that's for sure.

675
00:51:09,677 --> 00:51:13,319
[SPEAKER_11]: There's samples on the article though of what he's playing.

676
00:51:13,439 --> 00:51:13,659
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

677
00:51:14,755 --> 00:51:15,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

678
00:51:16,375 --> 00:51:23,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates and what's coming out to a video game store near you that maybe won't make you so uncomfortable.

679
00:51:25,038 --> 00:51:29,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, these games make me uncomfortable because I can't believe that they're still being made.

680
00:51:30,039 --> 00:51:33,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Although technically this is not really a new game, it's just kind of remade.

681
00:51:34,120 --> 00:52:00,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver are out today on the Nintendo DS later this week we're getting Spectral Force Genesis on DS as well one of the big games this week of course God of War 3 making its way out on Playstation 3 the expansion for Dragon Age Origins Awakening will be coming out on PC and Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 this week as well

682
00:52:01,575 --> 00:52:05,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Fragile Dreams, Feral Ruins of the Moon on the Wii.

683
00:52:05,817 --> 00:52:07,298
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a pretty decent game.

684
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:13,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Build a Bear, Welcome Hugsville on DS coming from Activision.

685
00:52:14,442 --> 00:52:16,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Who bought that game from Game Factory?

686
00:52:16,943 --> 00:52:18,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you purchase that title?

687
00:52:18,424 --> 00:52:19,705
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

688
00:52:20,785 --> 00:52:24,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Metro 2033 coming out on PC and Xbox 360 this week.

689
00:52:24,867 --> 00:52:29,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam X2, Beyond Time and Space coming out as a collection on...

00:52:39,042 --> 00:52:42,967
[SPEAKER_03]: A game based off, I guess, a Disney channel series.

694
00:52:43,128 --> 00:52:45,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Sunny with a Chance on a Nintendo DS.

695
00:52:47,643 --> 00:52:50,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Another Build-A-Bear game, Friendship Valley coming to the Wii.

696
00:52:51,484 --> 00:52:52,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Yippee skippee.

697
00:52:53,444 --> 00:52:56,305
[SPEAKER_03]: For PC though, this is a pretty big RTS game.

698
00:52:56,365 --> 00:53:03,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Command & Conquer 4, Tiberium Twilight coming out on PC this week.

699
00:53:03,907 --> 00:53:09,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Resonance of Fate, the other RPG you should be playing, coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

700
00:53:11,328 --> 00:53:12,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of a cool game actually.

701
00:53:12,209 --> 00:53:19,614
[SPEAKER_03]: That one's a little bit like Final Fantasy, but instead of using magic and stuff, you actually use Uzis and rocket launchers, which is all sorts of cool.

702
00:53:20,435 --> 00:53:27,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Hidden Mysteries, Buckingham Palace, Secrets of Kings and Queens on the DS, another casual title there.

703
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:35,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Pizza Delivery Boy, kind of a little bit of a cross between Cooking Mama and Crazy Taxi on the Wii.

704
00:53:37,101 --> 00:53:42,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Hall of Fame Ultimate Hoops Challenge budget basketball game on the Wii.

705
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:52,574
[SPEAKER_03]: And not really a game, but the new elites are supposed to be coming out this week bundled with Halo 3 ODST and Forza 3.

706
00:53:52,714 --> 00:53:54,315
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.

707
00:53:55,657 --> 00:54:00,400
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, traveling over to Japan to look at the releases that are coming out over there on the Xbox 360.

708
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:01,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Darksiders comes out.

709
00:54:02,682 --> 00:54:03,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of...

710
00:54:03,683 --> 00:54:09,886
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an action-y-ish game from Konami that I've seen described as God of War meets Zelda.

711
00:54:10,626 --> 00:54:11,727
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure that's interesting.

712
00:54:12,167 --> 00:54:18,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Also on the Xbox 360, Momo 2 Jai Daisen Ryaku Ultra Deluxe comes out.

713
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:24,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of a strategy type of game with these chibi little bombers and, of course, anime girls as the captains.

714
00:54:25,454 --> 00:54:26,334
[SPEAKER_05]: But it looks kind of cute.

715
00:54:26,914 --> 00:54:29,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't think that'll be a game that comes out here, though, so you'll have to import that one.

716
00:54:30,837 --> 00:54:33,321
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty much it on the Xbox 360.

717
00:54:33,842 --> 00:54:36,065
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation 3 has some exciting titles this week though.

718
00:54:36,386 --> 00:54:39,931
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation 3 is having something in Japan coming out this week called Torn.

719
00:54:40,292 --> 00:54:42,215
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's also coming out with a bundle.

720
00:54:42,555 --> 00:54:45,440
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not a game actually, it's a DVR type system.

721
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:46,621
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

722
00:55:05,423 --> 00:55:06,724
[SPEAKER_05]: That is coming out in Japan this week.

723
00:55:06,784 --> 00:55:07,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

724
00:55:07,684 --> 00:55:15,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Ryu Ga Gotoku 4 Densetsu Wo Sugumono 4 comes out this week in Japan.

725
00:55:16,629 --> 00:55:24,173
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that is Yakuza 4, which is kind of funny because we just got Yakuza 3 this week in the U.S.

726
00:55:24,594 --> 00:55:28,696
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, some of the articles that we've had recently on OrangeLawnTrader.com written by our

727
00:55:29,116 --> 00:55:48,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Lovely Webmaster Deekman They cut some crap out of Yakuza 3 Which is not making people happy I think on his Twitter he was saying Some like 20 different side quests and stuff Were all cut So hopefully if they do decide to port Yakuza 4 Which just came out on the PS3 in Japan this week They will not cut so darn much

728
00:55:49,712 --> 00:55:53,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Also on the PS3 this week in Japan, the God of War Collection makes its way to Japan.

729
00:55:54,376 --> 00:55:55,576
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty much it on the PS3.

730
00:55:55,897 --> 00:55:57,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to the Nintendo Wii, there really isn't much.

731
00:55:57,758 --> 00:55:59,559
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just one little title from Squeenix.

732
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:03,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Oyaku de Asobo Miphi no Omochabako.

733
00:56:03,302 --> 00:56:05,283
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't get too excited because I said that was Squeenix.

734
00:56:05,684 --> 00:56:10,007
[SPEAKER_05]: It honestly looks like a Sesame Street type of game featuring little rabbit characters.

735
00:56:10,427 --> 00:56:12,870
[SPEAKER_05]: That honestly, their mouths look like buttholes.

736
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:15,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't have a better way to explain it.

737
00:56:15,693 --> 00:56:19,597
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you look at their little mouths, they look like balloon knots.

738
00:56:19,817 --> 00:56:22,420
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wouldn't get too excited about that.

739
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:23,561
[SPEAKER_05]: But, hey, there you go.

740
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:27,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Sengoku Basara 2

741
00:56:43,913 --> 00:57:07,813
[SPEAKER_05]: a crayon game yay crayons and lastly going to the PSP Gundam Assault Survive comes out and ooh this is a fun one of it Jamie you'll be excited for this Ys 1 and 2 the 7 set comes out in Japan nice they've ported those games a couple times over in Japan haven't they I like Ys I don't think I've seen them out over here well I've got you're out of the DS are they out of the DS?

742
00:57:07,933 --> 00:57:10,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Ys 1 too oh okay very cool

743
00:57:11,607 --> 00:57:17,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Kevo in our chat wants to know why the hell did they cut so much of it, I believe, speaking about Yakuza 3.

744
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:24,714
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe, long story short, there were some things that they felt were, well, A, you could just say they were being lazy, but they rationalized it.

745
00:57:24,754 --> 00:57:34,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I think some of it was like Mahjong minigames, which, you know, it's not really a huge game here in the US, so I guess they figured people wouldn't know how to play it.

746
00:57:34,899 --> 00:57:35,279
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think...

747
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:37,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

748
00:57:59,263 --> 00:58:14,078
[SPEAKER_05]: I see a lot of friends of mine really into this game though so I don't think it's really affecting you know I think if you're a fan of Yakuza you're gonna grumble and cry but you still end up playing it so all right let's move on to the UK DarkSakura

749
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,381
[SPEAKER_11]: On the 16th, we have Dragon Age Origins Awakening.

750
00:58:19,322 --> 00:58:20,302
[SPEAKER_11]: The 17th, Perfect Dark.

751
00:58:21,482 --> 00:58:25,063
[SPEAKER_11]: And on the 18th, The Calling on Wii.

752
00:58:25,083 --> 00:58:26,744
[SPEAKER_11]: 19th, BlazBlue Calamity Trigger.

753
00:58:27,864 --> 00:58:30,725
[SPEAKER_11]: Command & Conquer 4, Tiberian Twilight, God of War 3.

754
00:58:30,765 --> 00:58:33,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Metro 2033, MotoGP 910.

755
00:58:33,526 --> 00:58:34,827
[SPEAKER_11]: And Supreme Commander 2.

756
00:58:43,049 --> 00:58:43,329
[SPEAKER_03]: That it?

757
00:58:43,629 --> 00:58:43,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

758
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:44,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

759
00:58:46,312 --> 00:58:47,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's see.

760
00:58:48,814 --> 00:59:05,767
[SPEAKER_03]: So, one of the big things that they were talking about during GDC and actually something that Mike kind of talked about during E3 last year was OnLive, the streaming service that's going to be available for, I guess, PCs and Macs

761
00:59:06,307 --> 00:59:07,048
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

762
00:59:24,262 --> 00:59:31,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and they announced that they're going to be launching their service June 17th, um, and it will be $15 per month.

763
00:59:31,808 --> 00:59:49,082
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's going to, um, you know, offer, this is, uh, depending on, I guess, um, you know, they're going to have like a micro console that's going to be released later on, I guess like a set-top box, if you will, um, that you can actually use instead of your PC.

764
00:59:49,903 --> 00:59:50,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

765
00:59:51,164 --> 01:00:19,411
[SPEAKER_03]: and I guess also you'll be able to they're going to have some upgrades later on they're going to offer 1080p support at 60 frames per second as I guess more bandwidth becomes available and OnLive I guess is going to be going the first three months they're going to only allow 25,000 people in I guess they're going to be staggering when people can join up

766
01:00:20,191 --> 01:00:21,251
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

767
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:53,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the games that are going to be available on the service, they are mentioning Mass Effect 2, Dragon Age Origins, also later on Prince of Persia, The Forgotten Sands will be available.

768
01:00:55,912 --> 01:01:19,174
[SPEAKER_03]: and apparently I guess 250,000 people signed up for the online beta not that all of them were let in and it says they expect that the demand will far outweigh the capacity of the services servers and so that they're going to actually have people pre-subscribe well of course they want to fluff it up sold out hard to get into exclusive you know because they want to pump people up

769
01:01:20,536 --> 01:01:29,482
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not knocking this because certainly I think this story has kind of come up before and it's kind of been just poo-pooed off as, oh yeah, sure, that'll happen.

770
01:01:29,902 --> 01:01:35,066
[SPEAKER_05]: But now they're saying, no, really, we're going to have this out in the fall and we plan to do this console and everything.

771
01:01:35,446 --> 01:01:42,051
[SPEAKER_05]: But explain to me real quick, and I realize there's a science behind this, but I need it really broken down for me here because I don't understand hardware so much.

772
01:01:42,111 --> 01:01:43,412
[SPEAKER_05]: How is this not GameTap?

773
01:01:44,913 --> 01:01:46,294
[SPEAKER_03]: This is basically...

774
01:01:48,766 --> 01:01:49,086
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

775
01:01:49,626 --> 01:01:51,787
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's going to be more sophisticated games, basically.

776
01:01:51,887 --> 01:01:57,008
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just emulating old games or older PC titles.

777
01:01:57,448 --> 01:02:03,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Say, for example, you have a crappy computer that happens to be on a decent network.

778
01:02:03,289 --> 01:02:10,571
[SPEAKER_03]: You can run Crysis now on it, basically with very little lag or no lag at all.

779
01:02:10,971 --> 01:02:13,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Burnout, you're going to be able to run that kind of stuff.

780
01:02:14,392 --> 01:02:15,033
[SPEAKER_03]: GameTap GameTap

781
01:02:35,367 --> 01:02:42,590
[SPEAKER_03]: And this also, they're going to also have a kind of an on-live game portal that's going to be free as well on top of all this stuff.

782
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:47,591
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically like a browser-based streaming device.

783
01:02:48,151 --> 01:03:01,016
[SPEAKER_03]: They're also going to have free streaming of selection of demos as well as, I guess, a limited number of full games for rent for a per-game fee without the monthly service charge.

784
01:03:01,416 --> 01:03:03,997
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of think of like what GameTap did except not free.

785
01:03:05,137 --> 01:03:07,158
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like their little free offerings.

786
01:03:10,781 --> 01:03:12,562
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it's interesting.

787
01:03:12,582 --> 01:03:18,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't know if I would really, I would probably not use this.

788
01:03:19,125 --> 01:03:20,346
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't play enough PC games.

789
01:03:22,905 --> 01:03:26,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Toy Gak says if it runs on their computers I might be able to play modern games again.

790
01:03:26,708 --> 01:03:31,351
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming that's the whole catch to this.

791
01:03:31,731 --> 01:03:39,877
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like having your PC as being a console whereas you don't have to worry about your PC being up to spec to run these games well.

792
01:03:40,577 --> 01:03:44,800
[SPEAKER_03]: You just have to have a fast enough internet connection and their PCs will do the work for you.

793
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:46,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

794
01:03:46,501 --> 01:03:51,083
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really curious to see how this runs, especially if it's really that smooth.

795
01:03:51,123 --> 01:03:58,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I would think that this would run into a similar problem as the whole Ubisoft thing, is that if your internet stops working, the games stop working.

796
01:03:58,967 --> 01:04:01,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Because how else are you going to get the data from the computer?

797
01:04:01,108 --> 01:04:05,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, that just goes with anything as far as streaming content goes.

798
01:04:05,690 --> 01:04:07,531
[SPEAKER_03]: You're on demand or anything.

799
01:04:07,571 --> 01:04:11,894
[SPEAKER_03]: If your connection stops working, then obviously, yes, it will shut off.

800
01:04:12,654 --> 01:04:14,355
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's the same with a phone call.

801
01:04:14,395 --> 01:04:18,197
[SPEAKER_03]: If your phone service goes out, then your phone call goes down.

802
01:04:18,978 --> 01:04:22,099
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess it would matter.

803
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:31,785
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to make sure that your data center, wherever you're connecting on live, if their data center goes down or wherever nearby, then yeah, you'd be kind of screwed.

804
01:04:31,805 --> 01:04:31,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

805
01:04:32,366 --> 01:04:34,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Chat, let me pose this question to chat real quick.

806
01:04:34,408 --> 01:04:36,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Is on live something that interests you?

807
01:04:37,112 --> 01:04:37,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Why or why not?

808
01:04:38,073 --> 01:04:40,857
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll kind of ask the folks in the studio here the same question.

809
01:04:40,897 --> 01:04:42,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Is on live something that interests you?

810
01:04:42,299 --> 01:04:42,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Why or why not?

811
01:04:43,821 --> 01:04:44,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki?

812
01:04:44,703 --> 01:04:44,783
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

813
01:04:45,606 --> 01:04:56,175
[SPEAKER_03]: and the reason why is because I don't play a lot of PC games anyways and a lot of the games that it seems like they're going to have on here are also console crossovers which I would just play on a console on my own time if I was doing that.

814
01:04:56,355 --> 01:04:57,155
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see why.

815
01:04:57,956 --> 01:05:02,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I don't have a lot of time for games anyways nowadays and I only seem to be playing like one game at a time.

816
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,361
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't see myself paying $15 a month for this.

817
01:05:06,643 --> 01:05:09,445
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to say no for the same reasons that Loki said.

818
01:05:09,506 --> 01:05:11,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm interested.

819
01:05:12,168 --> 01:05:18,473
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm curious to see how it works in action, but I think Loki hit the nail on the head console crossovers.

820
01:05:18,513 --> 01:05:20,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of this is already the stuff that's on the consoles.

821
01:05:21,175 --> 01:05:26,740
[SPEAKER_03]: And I built my PC to run Crysis, so goddammit, if I'm going to play Crysis, it's going to be running on my PC.

822
01:05:28,161 --> 01:05:34,106
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, I don't know if this is something that would interest you on live, being able to have your low-end computer stream the games.

823
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:38,402
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really care about that, honestly.

824
01:05:39,223 --> 01:05:45,768
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, if I'm going to play my live games, I'm just going to sit down and play them on my Xbox.

825
01:05:46,469 --> 01:05:47,570
[SPEAKER_11]: Kick Dan off of Borderlands.

826
01:05:49,391 --> 01:05:49,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

827
01:05:51,033 --> 01:05:52,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Is something wrong with chat?

828
01:05:52,134 --> 01:05:53,295
[SPEAKER_05]: It got really quiet in there.

829
01:05:53,335 --> 01:05:54,396
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a little worried.

830
01:05:54,576 --> 01:05:58,379
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all the hallucinogens I piped through the internet.

831
01:05:58,479 --> 01:05:59,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep in mind, there's also a delay.

832
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:05,602
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I say something, it takes like a minute just because we encode to all games who encodes to shout, you know, and da-da-da-da-da.

833
01:06:05,942 --> 01:06:08,824
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a little bit of a delay between when we say things and when they hit the chat room.

834
01:06:08,844 --> 01:06:11,105
[SPEAKER_05]: But finally, we're getting some feedback here.

835
01:06:11,445 --> 01:06:19,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft in our chat room says, no, because in Mexico, if the service will even be available here, we don't have a really good connection speed.

836
01:06:19,589 --> 01:06:21,109
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be laggy as hell probably.

837
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:26,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Bochicabua says, interested, but really I don't find it worth it.

838
01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:29,571
[SPEAKER_05]: GameFly account GameFly account

839
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:46,990
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

840
01:07:05,059 --> 01:07:10,901
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's great to think that you might do that, but in all reality, you're probably not going to.

841
01:07:11,801 --> 01:07:15,222
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be hard to keep track of what's going on in each different game.

842
01:07:15,262 --> 01:07:20,483
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know, back in the day, even then I still didn't really play a ton of different games.

843
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:25,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm usually playing one game to completion or until I get tired of it and move on to something else.

844
01:07:25,545 --> 01:07:26,305
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I'm the opposite.

845
01:07:26,365 --> 01:07:27,685
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gamer ADD all the way.

846
01:07:28,205 --> 01:07:29,186
[SPEAKER_05]: I play one thing and then what?

847
01:07:29,306 --> 01:07:29,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Another thing and what?

848
01:07:29,966 --> 01:07:30,106
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

849
01:07:30,206 --> 01:07:30,346
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

850
01:07:30,366 --> 01:07:30,446
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

851
01:07:31,126 --> 01:07:37,031
[SPEAKER_05]: The fact that I'm playing Final Fantasy XIII two weeks in a row pretty solidly, it's an event.

852
01:07:37,292 --> 01:07:42,616
[SPEAKER_05]: If you listen to the past months of this show, go find another game that I have that much attention for.

853
01:07:42,636 --> 01:07:47,360
[SPEAKER_03]: But you wouldn't feel lost if you didn't have these other options.

854
01:07:48,961 --> 01:07:52,725
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't see 40 or 50 games on there.

855
01:07:52,765 --> 01:07:57,969
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that would be a good value, but I wouldn't see myself using it.

856
01:07:59,097 --> 01:08:15,642
[SPEAKER_05]: a couple other quick thoughts here from our chat room Alpha Cananogram seems to think that it's Pokemon that's distracting all our chatters tonight everybody's busy catching their mudkips and their little balls that they run around with now because basically they took the walking trainer and incorporated that into a Pokemon game, am I correct?

857
01:08:16,362 --> 01:08:16,882
[SPEAKER_05]: okay, thank you

858
01:08:17,142 --> 01:08:21,768
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to have the old... It's like bringing back Tamagotchi.

859
01:08:22,269 --> 01:08:23,951
[SPEAKER_05]: I swear to God, that thing looks like a Tamagotchi.

860
01:08:23,991 --> 01:08:29,218
[SPEAKER_11]: You remember the old Pokemon Pikachu things that you just attached to your belt, the pedometer thing?

861
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:29,759
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it is.

862
01:08:29,959 --> 01:08:30,259
[SPEAKER_11]: Why not?

863
01:08:30,279 --> 01:08:31,341
[SPEAKER_11]: But remember the old ones.

864
01:08:34,207 --> 01:08:50,198
[SPEAKER_03]: All you need to do is download one of those free Xbox 360 massagers, plug in the fucking controller into the system, duct tape that little walker thing on there, set it to vibrate at the highest setting.

865
01:08:50,218 --> 01:08:50,899
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be good to go.

866
01:08:50,919 --> 01:08:51,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Or a paint shaker.

867
01:08:54,762 --> 01:08:57,445
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple other quick thoughts from our chat room on live.

868
01:08:58,146 --> 01:09:02,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Akuma JP says, yes, if it is cheaper, I would like to play games for my netbook.

869
01:09:03,112 --> 01:09:04,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, netbook is a good thought.

870
01:09:04,294 --> 01:09:07,958
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's tuned for netbooks, netbooks could be gaming devices.

871
01:09:07,998 --> 01:09:08,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting.

872
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:11,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Aki Ripper says, maybe, most likely, no.

873
01:09:12,724 --> 01:09:13,085
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

874
01:09:13,365 --> 01:09:23,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Thoughts from our chatroom, chat.orangeandre.com Speaking of moving and pedometers and all that shit, EA Sports Active 2.0 is announced and it's coming out for the Wii, the PS3, and the iPhone.

875
01:09:24,112 --> 01:09:25,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Oddly enough, nothing's said yet on the 360.

876
01:09:26,234 --> 01:09:33,239
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe, though, with Project Natal on the horizon, they aren't cooking something up for the 360, but my assumption is it's probably different.

877
01:09:33,779 --> 01:09:34,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably much different.

878
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:42,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, EA Sports Active, they are getting a proper sequel, not like a spin-off type thing like you've seen happen with the first set.

879
01:09:42,107 --> 01:09:44,890
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they had more exercises or whatever, but a proper sequel.

880
01:09:46,051 --> 01:09:52,258
[SPEAKER_05]: The console version of the game, now they're going to come with two motion sensors and a heart rate monitor you strap on your arm and leg.

881
01:09:54,306 --> 01:09:54,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

882
01:09:55,287 --> 01:09:56,688
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's going to measure your heart rate now.

883
01:09:58,829 --> 01:10:02,491
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, you can share this information over social networks online.

884
01:10:02,511 --> 01:10:05,353
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm assuming you're going to be able to Facebook your EA Active Progress.

885
01:10:05,413 --> 01:10:05,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Goody, goody.

886
01:10:06,974 --> 01:10:08,435
[SPEAKER_05]: EA Vancouver is developing it.

887
01:10:08,595 --> 01:10:17,981
[SPEAKER_05]: One other thing I noticed, it looks like almost like a little USB thing that you could like plug into your iPhone or something, almost like a little dongle, if you will, for your iPhone or, of course, iPod Touch with that.

888
01:10:18,101 --> 01:10:19,722
[SPEAKER_05]: So very interesting.

889
01:10:20,362 --> 01:10:21,443
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

890
01:10:43,358 --> 01:10:44,960
[SPEAKER_03]: for any peripheral.

891
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:50,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, they've done it with the Rock Band guitars and the Guitar Hero guitars, but that's about it.

892
01:10:52,328 --> 01:10:55,431
[SPEAKER_03]: The wireless technology, mostly everything has to be wired.

893
01:10:57,613 --> 01:11:03,960
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, obviously, since these devices are wireless, you're not going to be able to create some sort of wired device to plug in with...

894
01:11:06,389 --> 01:11:19,385
[SPEAKER_03]: That little USB shit could go in Yeah, but they don't do that kind of stuff That's why, it's different They have certain specifications at the meet Also play nice with each other

895
01:11:20,978 --> 01:11:26,000
[SPEAKER_05]: I still think you're... I can't believe that... EA is a big backer of 360.

896
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:28,461
[SPEAKER_05]: They put a lot of games out.

897
01:11:28,581 --> 01:11:29,362
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be Natal.

898
01:11:29,962 --> 01:11:30,902
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why.

899
01:11:31,723 --> 01:11:32,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyhow.

900
01:11:33,503 --> 01:11:34,684
[SPEAKER_05]: I could be wrong, but I'm probably not.

901
01:11:35,264 --> 01:11:37,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into our classic game of the week.

902
01:11:37,345 --> 01:11:39,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we're getting to the end of Part A, believe it or not.

903
01:11:40,066 --> 01:11:49,610
[SPEAKER_05]: And we always like to end the first half of our show by taking a trip down memory lane where DarkSakura is going to visit one of our classic video games from yesteryear.

904
01:11:50,282 --> 01:11:52,123
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the classic of the week, DarkSakura.

905
01:11:52,764 --> 01:11:55,325
[SPEAKER_05]: What video game should all the boys and girls out there be enjoying this week?

906
01:11:56,226 --> 01:11:58,347
[SPEAKER_11]: The game of the week is Gradius 2.

907
01:12:01,569 --> 01:12:11,115
[SPEAKER_11]: Gradius 2, and keep in mind, I have to make a mention, it is not the Gradius 2 that we got out as Nemesis 2 for the NES.

908
01:12:11,576 --> 01:12:15,718
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Gradius 2 for the arcade and PC engine.

909
01:12:16,139 --> 01:12:16,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Listen to the music for a minute.

910
01:12:27,783 --> 01:12:31,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, if you play Konami series of music games, you've heard this remix before.

911
01:12:33,245 --> 01:12:34,786
[SPEAKER_11]: That is where Burning Heat came from.

912
01:12:34,806 --> 01:12:45,369
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why when you're actually playing the music, it shows the suns with the little snakes coming out of the fire.

913
01:12:47,150 --> 01:12:50,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Gradius II, it was called Gradius II, The Ambition of Gopher.

914
01:12:50,591 --> 01:12:51,031
[SPEAKER_11]: It was...

915
01:12:52,972 --> 01:13:01,037
[SPEAKER_11]: It came out in 1988 in Japan, and it was the direct sequel to Gradius, and the prequel to Gradius 3, of course.

916
01:13:02,338 --> 01:13:06,741
[SPEAKER_11]: There were versions that came out for the Famicom, the PC Engine, and the X68000.

917
01:13:07,121 --> 01:13:15,766
[SPEAKER_11]: And it has been re-released, the PC Engine version, and Famicom versions are out on the Virtual Console.

918
01:13:17,527 --> 01:13:22,289
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, not in North America until it came out in Gradius Collection that came out in 2006.

919
01:13:24,029 --> 01:13:28,170
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the international releases on the Virtual Console.

920
01:13:30,191 --> 01:13:34,192
[SPEAKER_11]: Gradius 2 came out in Europe in the arcades under the name of Vulcan Venture.

921
01:13:35,268 --> 01:13:36,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

922
01:13:54,603 --> 01:14:01,571
[SPEAKER_05]: People think Life Force is Gradius 2 because of the way these games were marketed to us as children is that a lot of us thought Life Force was a sequel to Gradius.

923
01:14:01,851 --> 01:14:04,174
[SPEAKER_05]: But there actually were two separate series in Japan.

924
01:14:04,194 --> 01:14:06,156
[SPEAKER_05]: There was Salamander and there was Gradius.

925
01:14:06,276 --> 01:14:08,078
[SPEAKER_05]: We never got the actual Gradius 2.

926
01:14:08,359 --> 01:14:10,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, not back in the NES days.

927
01:14:10,121 --> 01:14:10,761
[SPEAKER_05]: We got it later.

928
01:14:11,462 --> 01:14:11,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Nemesis 2?

929
01:14:11,823 --> 01:14:12,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

930
01:14:14,445 --> 01:14:21,367
[SPEAKER_11]: was like the Life Force Grotius, not Grotius, Life Force Salamander thing.

931
01:14:21,407 --> 01:14:31,370
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just a very common whoopsie because, you know, and again, when I was a kid, I thought Life Force was the sequel to Grotius because they looked the same, they felt the same, but two different Japanese series that are just very similar.

932
01:14:32,389 --> 01:14:37,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, um, one of the good things, um, that came with this one is also the first one that had the boss rush.

933
01:14:39,354 --> 01:14:45,258
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, uh, that had levels that were only boss confrontation, so it was pretty cool.

934
01:14:45,978 --> 01:14:56,385
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so yeah, you had, you could pick your different, um, weapon systems so that as you picked up, uh, power-ups, you can choose which of your, uh, um, different, uh, power-ups you could do.

935
01:14:56,405 --> 01:15:02,149
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you could speed up, you had options, you had missile, double, laser, um, the ripple sucks, by the way.

936
01:15:03,489 --> 01:15:04,030
[SPEAKER_11]: It always has.

937
01:15:06,711 --> 01:15:13,993
[SPEAKER_11]: Now when this came out on the Famicom, it was one of the games that had a mapper chip to increase the graphics and sound.

938
01:15:14,073 --> 01:15:15,854
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of games in Japan had that.

939
01:15:16,394 --> 01:15:20,696
[SPEAKER_11]: But Nintendo, being big sticklers here in the US, they actually had to have...

940
01:15:22,837 --> 01:15:30,603
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of games were a lot better overseas because they couldn't bring them out with anything other than the proprietary carts over here, remember?

941
01:15:34,085 --> 01:15:44,133
[SPEAKER_11]: So there was the PC Engine version in 1992 that came out as a Super CD-ROM, which I have a burn of.

942
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:48,874
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, one could argue that that's why this game never came out in the U.S.

943
01:15:48,934 --> 01:15:56,436
[SPEAKER_05]: is because of the specialized cart and why Konami instead took the approach to kind of market Life Force as a sequel to Gradius, basically.

944
01:15:56,536 --> 01:16:04,738
[SPEAKER_11]: This is one of the games that I'm looking for, a legit one, by the way, because it is just so awesome.

945
01:16:04,878 --> 01:16:07,999
[SPEAKER_11]: This is my favorite Gradius game.

946
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:09,840
[SPEAKER_11]: There's also...

947
01:16:12,674 --> 01:16:17,937
[SPEAKER_11]: They added an additional stage though for the PC Engine version that came from the NES version of Life Force.

948
01:16:18,618 --> 01:16:20,479
[SPEAKER_11]: That was also the first stage of Gradius III.

949
01:16:21,279 --> 01:16:26,542
[SPEAKER_11]: It also came out for the Gradius Deluxe Pack for PlayStation, Saturn, and Windows in 96.

950
01:16:27,903 --> 01:16:34,187
[SPEAKER_11]: And then came out worldwide Gradius Collection for the PSP.

951
01:16:34,827 --> 01:16:38,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course the PC Engine version was a Hanabi Festival game in 2008.

952
01:16:44,356 --> 01:16:46,738
[SPEAKER_11]: and of course there's all these sweet spots in every boss battle.

953
01:16:47,699 --> 01:16:50,001
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, that one spot you gotta hit to kill it fast.

954
01:16:50,741 --> 01:16:52,503
[SPEAKER_05]: And Ripple does suck, I agree.

955
01:16:52,703 --> 01:16:53,944
[SPEAKER_11]: Ripple is ass.

956
01:16:55,145 --> 01:16:55,545
[SPEAKER_11]: Ripple!

957
01:16:55,865 --> 01:16:56,386
[SPEAKER_11]: Ha!

958
01:16:56,826 --> 01:17:00,209
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is, your classic game of the week, Gradius 2.

959
01:17:00,429 --> 01:17:02,331
[SPEAKER_05]: That little clip coming to you from the PC Engine.

960
01:17:02,431 --> 01:17:08,836
[SPEAKER_11]: The one reason to ever take the Ripple laser is because the progression afterwards had... Didn't it have doubles?

961
01:17:10,014 --> 01:17:11,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Double was in.

962
01:17:11,476 --> 01:17:15,821
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the one that came after Ripple, I think it was your other option.

963
01:17:17,223 --> 01:17:21,669
[SPEAKER_11]: I know there was always a reason to take the Ripple route, but you'd just always bypass Ripple.

964
01:17:22,635 --> 01:17:23,916
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw asks a good question.

965
01:17:23,936 --> 01:17:24,996
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a valid question from Jack.

966
01:17:25,136 --> 01:17:26,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Does Gradius 2 have vertical stages?

967
01:17:27,618 --> 01:17:27,758
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

968
01:17:27,838 --> 01:17:27,978
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

969
01:17:28,058 --> 01:17:29,639
[SPEAKER_05]: That was unique to the Salamander series, right?

970
01:17:29,659 --> 01:17:30,319
[SPEAKER_11]: That was Salamander.

971
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:32,040
[SPEAKER_05]: That was part of what made that series unique, right?

972
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:32,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

973
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:33,180
[SPEAKER_05]: It was vertical stages.

974
01:17:33,221 --> 01:17:33,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Good question, though.

975
01:17:35,041 --> 01:17:41,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, all the marketing changes and stuff from Japan over here kind of screwed us up as a kid.

976
01:17:41,325 --> 01:17:45,307
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when Final Fantasy 7 came out, who didn't ask, where the hell is 4 through 6?

977
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:48,736
[SPEAKER_11]: I just thought it was kind of cool.

978
01:17:48,757 --> 01:17:50,262
[SPEAKER_11]: They're like, yeah, we know.

979
01:17:50,564 --> 01:17:52,993
[SPEAKER_05]: I think by then a lot of people had figured it out, but, you know.

980
01:17:53,450 --> 01:17:53,710
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

981
01:17:54,070 --> 01:17:56,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, we're going to take a break here at Orange Lounge Radio.

982
01:17:56,371 --> 01:17:57,552
[SPEAKER_05]: We got plenty more coming up.

983
01:17:57,612 --> 01:18:01,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Some quick news when we come back about DJ Hero and Tron.

984
01:18:01,874 --> 01:18:03,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody see that trailer for the new Tron movie?

985
01:18:04,255 --> 01:18:05,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks sweet.

986
01:18:05,315 --> 01:18:07,316
[SPEAKER_05]: But I got to say, well, actually, no, I take it back.

987
01:18:07,356 --> 01:18:09,057
[SPEAKER_05]: The movie's probably going to be ridiculous.

988
01:18:09,277 --> 01:18:15,280
[SPEAKER_05]: But the score by Daft Punk sounds amazing, just even based on that little trailer I saw.

989
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:17,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Got to say, very cool.

990
01:18:18,081 --> 01:18:20,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's see.

991
01:18:21,105 --> 01:18:26,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Also news on XNA and Nintendo, another Hanabi festival coming up.

992
01:18:26,894 --> 01:18:30,999
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to get into all of that a little later on in Part B of our show.

993
01:18:31,019 --> 01:18:31,580
[SPEAKER_05]: So don't go anywhere.

994
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,904
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

995
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:44,665
[SPEAKER_05]: And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday night, March 14th of 2010.

996
01:18:45,385 --> 01:18:46,626
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, Pi Day.

997
01:18:47,167 --> 01:18:48,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Hope you're enjoying some pie.

998
01:18:48,568 --> 01:18:50,971
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not really having pie in studio, which is a bit surprising.

999
01:18:51,291 --> 01:18:52,092
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of full, though.

1000
01:18:52,132 --> 01:18:55,335
[SPEAKER_05]: I had fast food on the way over to the show, driving back from San Francisco.

1001
01:18:55,735 --> 01:18:58,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadly, I was in San Francisco, but not at Game Developers Conference.

1002
01:18:58,558 --> 01:19:00,160
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know, I'm not a game developer.

1003
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:02,262
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, you have to be one of the...

1004
01:19:02,942 --> 01:19:06,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Big media companies, it's a magazine or whatever to get in there, but that's okay.

1005
01:19:06,963 --> 01:19:09,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I think I would find the topics fascinating.

1006
01:19:10,044 --> 01:19:13,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, I kind of like the science of game development and stuff.

1007
01:19:13,244 --> 01:19:16,005
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I understand that it's not really a media event.

1008
01:19:16,025 --> 01:19:18,165
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what E3's for, so I'm not going to be all butthurt.

1009
01:19:18,185 --> 01:19:18,666
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going.

1010
01:19:18,986 --> 01:19:22,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I wish I could have crashed some of the sweet parties I've heard about.

1011
01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:24,407
[SPEAKER_03]: It would have been fun to try the move stuff out, but...

1012
01:19:25,367 --> 01:19:25,947
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about it.

1013
01:19:26,027 --> 01:19:27,848
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all going to be at E3 in a couple months anyway.

1014
01:19:28,048 --> 01:19:30,348
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not too worried about it.

1015
01:19:30,609 --> 01:19:32,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, I don't even know if I'm going to E3 this year.

1016
01:19:32,549 --> 01:19:34,129
[SPEAKER_03]: I am definitely not going to E3.

1017
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:35,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry to hear it.

1018
01:19:35,410 --> 01:19:40,771
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a strain to try to go each year anyways.

1019
01:19:40,831 --> 01:19:44,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to take a year off.

1020
01:19:44,512 --> 01:19:46,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year, remember we went and it was kind of like...

1021
01:19:46,773 --> 01:19:48,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is cool.

1022
01:19:48,715 --> 01:19:56,200
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like there's really more I want to see this year between the Portal 2, the Final Fantasy XIV, the Move, the Natal, all this stuff.

1023
01:19:56,441 --> 01:19:58,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Or whatever Xbox ends up naming their thing.

1024
01:20:00,344 --> 01:20:01,925
[SPEAKER_05]: All that stuff I want to see this year.

1025
01:20:02,005 --> 01:20:02,966
[SPEAKER_05]: So it seems like there's more to it.

1026
01:20:03,246 --> 01:20:03,866
[SPEAKER_03]: In good time.

1027
01:20:03,947 --> 01:20:04,427
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1028
01:20:04,527 --> 01:20:07,469
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just... I don't know.

1029
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:08,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1030
01:20:08,484 --> 01:20:13,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's get into some rapid fire news and then we're going to get into some Twitter topics as well.

1031
01:20:13,166 --> 01:20:15,307
[SPEAKER_05]: So you just have a few more minutes to get your Twitter topics in.

1032
01:20:15,327 --> 01:20:18,488
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a few pouring into the Twitter already at OLR.

1033
01:20:18,809 --> 01:20:19,129
[SPEAKER_10]: Porn?

1034
01:20:19,449 --> 01:20:19,709
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1035
01:20:19,749 --> 01:20:20,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Poring.

1036
01:20:20,429 --> 01:20:20,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Poring.

1037
01:20:20,769 --> 01:20:21,490
[SPEAKER_05]: I just said it fast.

1038
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:21,930
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1039
01:20:22,290 --> 01:20:24,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, start us off with some quick news tonight.

1040
01:20:24,511 --> 01:20:27,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Activision surprised us.

1041
01:20:27,372 --> 01:20:27,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo!

1042
01:20:28,332 --> 01:20:31,773
[SPEAKER_03]: They have new download content coming out to DJ Hero.

1043
01:20:32,793 --> 01:20:35,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I don't give a flying fuck about it.

1044
01:20:35,893 --> 01:20:37,594
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is really sad.

1045
01:20:37,634 --> 01:20:40,254
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, unless you're a fan of... But you've been asking for it for forever.

1046
01:20:40,274 --> 01:20:41,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes, I've been asking for it.

1047
01:20:41,975 --> 01:20:45,676
[SPEAKER_03]: I was hoping that they would, I don't know, put out some good download content.

1048
01:20:46,076 --> 01:20:46,876
[SPEAKER_03]: And granted, you know...

1049
01:20:47,876 --> 01:20:52,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess if you like Eminem and Jay-Z, you probably would have bought the Renegade Edition.

1050
01:20:52,459 --> 01:20:56,422
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't, so I didn't, and therefore I'm not buying this either.

1051
01:20:56,822 --> 01:21:01,485
[SPEAKER_03]: But for the sake of reporting it, I will tell you what three mixes they have in there.

1052
01:21:02,065 --> 01:21:11,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Shake That mixed with Show Me What You Got, Without Me mixed with Encore, and Can I Get A mixed with Lose Yourself.

1053
01:21:12,712 --> 01:21:24,056
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've watched the video previews of these, and let me just say, I'm about as excited about these songs as I have been describing these songs to you.

1054
01:21:24,176 --> 01:21:26,297
[SPEAKER_03]: It's seriously awful.

1055
01:21:26,557 --> 01:21:28,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you're more of a trance guy anyway.

1056
01:21:28,878 --> 01:21:33,740
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, that's fine, but I even gave the last extended mix pack, whatever, I gave that a chance.

1057
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:35,621
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't really...

1058
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:39,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Check out the... I downloaded the David Guetta stuff, but I haven't... I did.

1059
01:21:40,046 --> 01:21:40,707
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that pack a lot.

1060
01:21:40,727 --> 01:21:41,869
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not played those yet.

1061
01:21:42,470 --> 01:21:43,952
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe I'll go back to that, but...

1062
01:21:45,276 --> 01:21:46,316
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the other pack too.

1063
01:21:47,797 --> 01:21:50,257
[SPEAKER_05]: There was, what was it, Gorillaz and something?

1064
01:21:50,437 --> 01:21:54,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, All of Me and Radio Gaga.

1065
01:21:54,938 --> 01:21:56,838
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my favorite song in the whole freaking game.

1066
01:21:56,858 --> 01:21:58,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the extended mix packs.

1067
01:21:58,279 --> 01:22:00,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that download mix.

1068
01:22:00,859 --> 01:22:03,580
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Gorillaz song was in the other song in there.

1069
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:08,661
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I realize Eminem, Jay-Z, they sell bazillions of albums.

1070
01:22:09,461 --> 01:22:11,083
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1071
01:22:30,319 --> 01:22:31,080
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1072
01:22:54,554 --> 01:23:00,678
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, seriously, when the fuck are you going to add some more download content and support this stuff?

1073
01:23:00,958 --> 01:23:15,407
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again, we're talking Activision here, so really I've just got to wait for some sort of DJing game from Harmonix or EA before I get that real download content, because I sure as hell am not going to get it with Activision.

1074
01:23:15,427 --> 01:23:17,008
[SPEAKER_05]: What about Scratch, the ultimate DJ?

1075
01:23:17,388 --> 01:23:18,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, when's that coming out?

1076
01:23:46,167 --> 01:23:47,950
[SPEAKER_03]: You get them for a dollar more!

1077
01:23:48,110 --> 01:23:55,921
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, they're sold as single downloads for 300 Wii Points, and that's a total of $9 for each.

1078
01:23:56,001 --> 01:23:57,684
[SPEAKER_03]: So guess what, you get to pay the Wii Premium.

1079
01:24:00,646 --> 01:24:01,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm done there.

1080
01:24:02,826 --> 01:24:07,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, what is kind of neat is they're going to be adding a new way to navigate PlayStation Home.

1081
01:24:07,627 --> 01:24:11,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, it's kind of a take of the cross-media bar.

1082
01:24:11,768 --> 01:24:14,729
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way they're doing it is they're going to be able to go to different spaces.

1083
01:24:14,749 --> 01:24:17,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, for example, you can favorite different spaces you like going to.

1084
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:23,391
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go to personal spaces, whatever.

1085
01:24:24,071 --> 01:24:25,651
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot that came out this week.

1086
01:24:25,751 --> 01:24:30,575
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be a lot quicker to bounce from one place to another without having to walk aimlessly through a bunch of empty places.

1087
01:24:30,595 --> 01:24:32,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I do anything with the OLR club yet?

1088
01:24:32,356 --> 01:24:33,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, by the way, is full.

1089
01:24:33,617 --> 01:24:37,901
[SPEAKER_05]: I keep getting requests for the club, and unfortunately, I'm limited to 25 members.

1090
01:24:38,901 --> 01:24:43,925
[SPEAKER_05]: I seriously get new requests to join the club every other day, which I'm flattered, and thank you all for wanting to join.

1091
01:24:44,226 --> 01:24:45,206
[SPEAKER_05]: But unfortunately, it's full.

1092
01:24:45,286 --> 01:24:51,852
[SPEAKER_05]: So until Sony will let us have, I don't know, 50 people, 100 people, all your apps are just sitting there waiting to be approved until...

1093
01:24:52,652 --> 01:25:00,615
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not rejecting them, I'm just not answering them because I'm hoping that one day Sony's going to say, hey, we're going to make clubs useful and now you can have 50 or 100 people in them.

1094
01:25:00,635 --> 01:25:07,358
[SPEAKER_03]: They probably just can't physically handle that many people in one space at a time or in that close proximity.

1095
01:25:07,378 --> 01:25:11,999
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a bunch of bull because if you go to the main space area, you can see more than 25 people there at a time.

1096
01:25:12,099 --> 01:25:12,479
[SPEAKER_05]: No offense.

1097
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:16,061
[SPEAKER_05]: If that's Sony's line, I claim bullshit.

1098
01:25:16,681 --> 01:25:18,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but how many servers are running that one space?

1099
01:25:19,805 --> 01:25:20,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1100
01:25:20,305 --> 01:25:20,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

1101
01:25:21,226 --> 01:25:22,027
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just not doing it.

1102
01:25:22,507 --> 01:25:23,148
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

1103
01:25:23,288 --> 01:25:26,792
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going on home either, so this doesn't mean anything to me as well.

1104
01:25:27,673 --> 01:25:29,475
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if there's going to be a theme going on here.

1105
01:25:30,316 --> 01:25:31,317
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's find out.

1106
01:25:32,779 --> 01:25:33,539
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of neat.

1107
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:37,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently people think that you're going to have the power of the PS3 in your pocket within three years.

1108
01:25:38,424 --> 01:25:49,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the group, um, Imagination Technologies, maker of the PowerVR chips, says, um, that, I guess, powers, like, you know, smartphones like iPhones, Android, and whatnot.

1109
01:25:50,108 --> 01:25:54,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they said that they, um, you'll have graphics comparable to PS3 in three years.

1110
01:25:55,230 --> 01:25:58,731
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason is because they're designing the chips right now for that kind of stuff.

1111
01:25:59,371 --> 01:25:59,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, apparently...

1112
01:26:01,893 --> 01:26:09,358
[SPEAKER_03]: They're working with different groups to license things like Apple, HTC, whatnot.

1113
01:26:09,598 --> 01:26:24,350
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying that in three years, Imagination says you're going to have a PS3 in your pocket and it's not going to be running at 480x340 resolution that most smartphones have now, but it's actually going to be like a 720p output via HDMI to a TV.

1114
01:26:26,368 --> 01:26:31,739
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be something, a phone that outputs to a TV via HDMI.

1115
01:26:33,383 --> 01:26:33,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

1116
01:26:36,929 --> 01:26:41,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they go into a lot more detail, of course, on different technologies that are out there and stuff.

1117
01:26:41,572 --> 01:26:57,343
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can only imagine, though, that as time goes on, I mean, the technology is just growing at a geometric rate that, of course, I can imagine us actually having that kind of technology soon within the next five years.

1118
01:26:58,516 --> 01:27:12,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, that seems a little aggressive, seeing as if you go by the whole, like, Nintendo is one off from the, you know, consoles with their handhelds, meaning that the DS is kind of like a 64, just like the Advance was kind of like a Super Nintendo.

1119
01:27:12,542 --> 01:27:15,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Then the next handheld from Nintendo will be kind of like a GameCube.

1120
01:27:15,543 --> 01:27:17,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Funny that you mention that, actually.

1121
01:27:17,304 --> 01:27:17,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh?

1122
01:27:17,924 --> 01:27:20,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I have something that'll be for last-minute stories for that.

1123
01:27:20,385 --> 01:27:21,346
[SPEAKER_03]: I can come right now if you want.

1124
01:27:21,366 --> 01:27:21,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

1125
01:27:21,846 --> 01:27:22,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, please.

1126
01:27:22,626 --> 01:27:23,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Please don't make me wait any longer.

1127
01:27:24,007 --> 01:27:24,567
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to know.

1128
01:27:25,047 --> 01:27:25,587
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to know.

1129
01:27:25,627 --> 01:27:26,068
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm dying.

1130
01:27:27,708 --> 01:27:29,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently there's a rumor about DS2.

1131
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:31,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, there's always a rumor about DS2.

1132
01:27:31,271 --> 01:27:32,953
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always some damn rumor about DS2.

1133
01:27:33,413 --> 01:27:52,308
[SPEAKER_03]: According to somebody's sources within GDC, I'm not going to read through the article to see who exactly is quoting here, that it's in the developers' hands, and apparently they're not having trouble developing for it because it's basically a GameCube, power-wise, and everyone knows how to develop for a GameCube because they've been doing it for quite a while with both the GameCube and the Wii.

1134
01:27:52,328 --> 01:27:53,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, because the Wii is a GameCube, too.

1135
01:27:53,669 --> 01:27:54,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, yes.

1136
01:27:54,950 --> 01:27:59,411
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing is it's going to be interesting.

1137
01:27:59,791 --> 01:28:01,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently the people are familiar with the dev kit.

1138
01:28:02,192 --> 01:28:10,674
[SPEAKER_03]: It made it sound like there wasn't much learning curve on the new system and that devs who worked on GameCube or Wii games will find it easy to create with.

1139
01:28:11,134 --> 01:28:21,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Also they said that apparently the system has a built-in accelerometer and two big higher resolution screens that are closer together so that they can more easily be used as one screen.

1140
01:28:22,838 --> 01:28:22,958
[SPEAKER_03]: And

1141
01:28:24,378 --> 01:28:28,300
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the idea of bringing the two screens closer together to make one big screen I think that's kind of cool

1142
01:28:52,529 --> 01:28:54,758
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if they'll both be touch sensitive this time.

1143
01:28:56,862 --> 01:28:57,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Possibly, right?

1144
01:28:57,802 --> 01:28:58,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, why not?

1145
01:28:58,622 --> 01:29:03,083
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, just pro tip, Nintendo, if it's going to run on GameCube-y type hardware, F-Zero.

1146
01:29:03,523 --> 01:29:04,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thanks.

1147
01:29:05,364 --> 01:29:12,805
[SPEAKER_03]: And just because it runs on GameCube type hardware does not mean that I want to see fucking ports of every single GameCube game that you guys put out.

1148
01:29:13,265 --> 01:29:13,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay?

1149
01:29:13,885 --> 01:29:14,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Do some new shit.

1150
01:29:15,306 --> 01:29:15,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

1151
01:29:16,246 --> 01:29:17,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless it's Wind Waker.

1152
01:29:17,266 --> 01:29:18,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Wind Waker I will accept.

1153
01:29:18,746 --> 01:29:22,047
[SPEAKER_03]: The rest of them, except for F-Zero, I reject them all.

1154
01:29:23,909 --> 01:29:33,978
[SPEAKER_03]: And for God's sake, please, you know, maybe add some more buttons to the face, like an analog stick or something like that so that we can actually play games in traditional sense.

1155
01:29:33,998 --> 01:29:39,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember they used to have that, like, thumb stylus thing that you would have to strap to your finger that came with it?

1156
01:29:39,103 --> 01:29:39,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes, I do.

1157
01:29:40,824 --> 01:29:40,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh.

1158
01:29:40,944 --> 01:29:41,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh.

1159
01:30:10,226 --> 01:30:34,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Hank Chien is his name he's a plastic surgeon from New York he has beaten Billy Mitchell's record Billy Mitchell by the way had 1,050,200 points Hank has scored 1,061,700 points officially verified by Twin Galaxies an original Donkey Kong cabinet machine in New York is how he said it congrats to him now he can star in the sequel

1160
01:30:35,169 --> 01:30:35,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

1161
01:30:35,490 --> 01:30:35,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

1162
01:30:54,890 --> 01:30:55,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1163
01:31:12,652 --> 01:31:20,058
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember when we went to Classic Gaming Expo one year and they were doing like the official Twin Galaxies high score for I think it was Stampede on the 2600.

1164
01:31:20,098 --> 01:31:21,239
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember that.

1165
01:31:21,620 --> 01:31:22,821
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Stampede.

1166
01:31:22,961 --> 01:31:25,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I think I was like last place for the day.

1167
01:31:25,403 --> 01:31:27,124
[SPEAKER_05]: I was so fucking terrible at Stampede.

1168
01:31:27,484 --> 01:31:30,807
[SPEAKER_05]: But the guy was trying to give me tips and stuff and what he was saying made a lot of sense.

1169
01:31:30,847 --> 01:31:37,673
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was just like, wow, when I was a kid, I didn't think about these games like that, like the tips and everything he was trying to give me.

1170
01:31:37,773 --> 01:31:40,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just like, I just tried to lasso the horse thingies.

1171
01:31:41,716 --> 01:31:43,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Light Cycles Light Cycles

1172
01:32:10,712 --> 01:32:12,473
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not so much good, it's just cool.

1173
01:32:13,813 --> 01:32:15,114
[SPEAKER_05]: So Tron Legacy's coming out.

1174
01:32:15,154 --> 01:32:19,375
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta say, despite the fact that the expectation bar for the movies are very low, you know I'm gonna be seeing it opening day.

1175
01:32:20,256 --> 01:32:21,816
[SPEAKER_05]: You know I'm gonna go, just like many of you.

1176
01:32:22,516 --> 01:32:26,218
[SPEAKER_05]: The score by Daft Punk sounds awesome.

1177
01:32:26,318 --> 01:32:28,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, what's a word that's better than awesome?

1178
01:32:28,439 --> 01:32:29,199
[SPEAKER_05]: More awesome.

1179
01:32:29,879 --> 01:32:30,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Super awesome.

1180
01:32:58,792 --> 01:33:08,914
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very similar to, like, I've seen something similar in Rolling Stone that, like, had all these different band names as a picture, like somebody smashing a pumpkin.

1181
01:33:08,934 --> 01:33:09,875
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I already did all these.

1182
01:33:09,975 --> 01:33:10,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Things like that.

1183
01:33:10,795 --> 01:33:11,455
[SPEAKER_03]: I already did all these.

1184
01:33:11,475 --> 01:33:16,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, for example, GoldenEye, Star Fox, Seawolf.

1185
01:33:16,756 --> 01:33:18,277
[SPEAKER_05]: I see Kongo Bongo there at the bottom.

1186
01:33:18,517 --> 01:33:20,357
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's actually Donkey Konga.

1187
01:33:20,477 --> 01:33:20,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Frogger.

1188
01:33:20,997 --> 01:33:21,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's a donkey.

1189
01:33:22,178 --> 01:33:23,318
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a classic game.

1190
01:33:23,838 --> 01:33:31,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Shadow of the Colossus, Frogger, Outrun That one right there is Birdie King, it's a golf game, TimeSplitters, Bomberman

1191
01:33:42,887 --> 01:33:45,729
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I actually figured most of those out.

1192
01:33:45,769 --> 01:33:56,236
[SPEAKER_03]: You can thank me putting together my main cabinet for being aware of all these different... Because a lot of the stuff I had themes for, my hyperspin stuff, so the names became familiar.

1193
01:33:57,797 --> 01:34:02,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, you can ask my co-worker because I sat there for the first hour that day that it came out.

1194
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:03,861
[SPEAKER_03]: During the day, just working on that.

1195
01:34:04,021 --> 01:34:07,223
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100Matt says, it was a good B-movie.

1196
01:34:07,323 --> 01:34:07,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Tron, that is.

1197
01:34:07,904 --> 01:34:08,924
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good way of defining it.

1198
01:34:09,004 --> 01:34:11,026
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Tron for the same reason I like Showgirls.

1199
01:34:11,486 --> 01:34:12,767
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so bad, it's good.

1200
01:34:12,807 --> 01:34:14,069
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no, Tron is great.

1201
01:34:14,129 --> 01:34:15,211
[SPEAKER_05]: You are a whore, darling.

1202
01:34:15,732 --> 01:34:16,994
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Tron.

1203
01:34:17,014 --> 01:34:18,217
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good movie to me.

1204
01:34:18,457 --> 01:34:18,898
[SPEAKER_05]: End of line.

1205
01:34:18,918 --> 01:34:21,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you seen the game trailer for Tron Legacy?

1206
01:34:21,502 --> 01:34:21,863
[SPEAKER_05]: I have.

1207
01:34:22,284 --> 01:34:23,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't it remind you of Force Unleashed?

1208
01:34:25,781 --> 01:34:27,342
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't thinking of it that way, but yeah.

1209
01:34:27,442 --> 01:34:29,703
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the old school Tron arcade game, man.

1210
01:34:29,723 --> 01:34:30,343
[SPEAKER_05]: That was awesome.

1211
01:34:30,583 --> 01:34:34,685
[SPEAKER_05]: But of course, it's one of those things that's better left in my memory because when I played it on an Xbox Live, I was kind of like, eh.

1212
01:34:35,785 --> 01:34:38,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and Tron and Discs of Tron are actually at the bottom of that page, too.

1213
01:34:39,067 --> 01:34:39,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they really?

1214
01:34:39,647 --> 01:34:39,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1215
01:34:39,807 --> 01:34:44,229
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, anyhow, Actdeft also says it was Empire Magazine that did that collage I'm thinking of.

1216
01:34:44,269 --> 01:34:45,469
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably been done a couple times.

1217
01:34:45,509 --> 01:34:46,970
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say there's a movie one out there, too.

1218
01:34:47,150 --> 01:34:47,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1219
01:34:47,530 --> 01:34:49,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, who cares about all of this news?

1220
01:34:49,611 --> 01:34:51,552
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you what the biggest news of the week is.

1221
01:34:51,632 --> 01:34:53,212
[SPEAKER_05]: This is gigantic news.

1222
01:34:53,252 --> 01:34:54,193
[SPEAKER_05]: This is epic news.

1223
01:34:54,273 --> 01:34:54,613
[SPEAKER_05]: This is...

1224
01:34:55,733 --> 01:34:57,835
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe we didn't lead the show off with this news tonight.

1225
01:34:58,355 --> 01:35:00,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Lady Gaga is coming to Rock Band.

1226
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:00,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that's right.

1227
01:35:00,656 --> 01:35:10,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Lady Gaga will be coming on to Rock Band with a four-pack of songs, including Just Dance, Bad Romance, Poker Face, and Monster.

1228
01:35:11,242 --> 01:35:12,023
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's not all.

1229
01:35:12,343 --> 01:35:14,744
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a bonus fifth song you're going to be able to get.

1230
01:35:14,765 --> 01:35:18,867
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to be able to get the Eric Cartman version of Poker Face.

1231
01:35:18,887 --> 01:35:20,028
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the only reason to get it.

1232
01:35:22,631 --> 01:35:26,193
[SPEAKER_03]: And the best part about it is he is playing the song in rock band in the show.

1233
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:40,748
[SPEAKER_05]: and Living Rooms Across America.

1234
01:35:41,049 --> 01:35:42,269
[SPEAKER_05]: I will be buying all these tracks.

1235
01:35:42,309 --> 01:35:46,890
[SPEAKER_05]: I will be buying every single one of them because I am such a huge stan for Lady Gaga.

1236
01:35:46,910 --> 01:35:47,530
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not even funny.

1237
01:35:50,731 --> 01:35:52,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you even told me you like Bad Romance.

1238
01:35:52,111 --> 01:35:53,032
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of the four songs.

1239
01:35:53,652 --> 01:35:56,152
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, but I don't know that I like it enough to buy it on Rock Band.

1240
01:35:57,313 --> 01:35:58,593
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll stick with Rush, thank you.

1241
01:35:59,173 --> 01:35:59,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.

1242
01:35:59,813 --> 01:36:00,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Rush is cool.

1243
01:36:00,654 --> 01:36:01,354
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't deny that.

1244
01:36:01,374 --> 01:36:05,155
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just Lady Gaga is, just like I said before, more awesomer.

1245
01:36:05,495 --> 01:36:05,755
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1246
01:36:07,768 --> 01:36:11,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously though, how about some other last minute stories, DarkSakura?

1247
01:36:11,449 --> 01:36:12,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Last minute?

1248
01:36:13,189 --> 01:36:13,969
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, not last minute.

1249
01:36:14,009 --> 01:36:15,269
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a quick, whatever.

1250
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:17,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Too many segments on this damn show.

1251
01:36:17,530 --> 01:36:18,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Just read a story.

1252
01:36:18,890 --> 01:36:19,650
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care what it is.

1253
01:36:19,690 --> 01:36:20,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Just read something.

1254
01:36:20,570 --> 01:36:21,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Once upon a time, what?

1255
01:36:21,431 --> 01:36:21,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Today, Shermie pooped.

1256
01:36:22,411 --> 01:36:22,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, goody.

1257
01:36:22,691 --> 01:36:23,791
[SPEAKER_10]: And I cleaned it out of her box.

1258
01:36:24,931 --> 01:36:28,712
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I do have to say, the poop situation is over.

1259
01:36:29,712 --> 01:36:29,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh?

1260
01:36:30,392 --> 01:36:31,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you find out what happened?

1261
01:36:31,453 --> 01:36:33,213
[SPEAKER_05]: An update on Shermie's bowel movements.

1262
01:36:34,596 --> 01:36:35,457
[SPEAKER_11]: She's just an old lady.

1263
01:36:36,237 --> 01:36:38,058
[SPEAKER_11]: She couldn't get in her cat box, it was too deep.

1264
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:40,960
[SPEAKER_11]: We got her a shallower one, changed her litter, she's happy.

1265
01:36:41,220 --> 01:36:43,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Does she need kitty depends or anything?

1266
01:36:43,741 --> 01:36:45,042
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not putting cat diapers on her.

1267
01:36:45,562 --> 01:36:46,823
[SPEAKER_05]: No kitty insurer in her?

1268
01:36:48,364 --> 01:36:49,905
[SPEAKER_11]: I did buy her cat grass and she's happy.

1269
01:36:52,086 --> 01:36:53,307
[SPEAKER_05]: For anybody that was wondering.

1270
01:36:53,827 --> 01:36:56,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you everyone who is concerned over my cat's poop.

1271
01:36:57,769 --> 01:36:59,570
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you remember the game Hotel Dusk?

1272
01:37:00,563 --> 01:37:05,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I haven't talked about the tester on this show in a few weeks, which I've watched every episode of the tester.

1273
01:37:05,511 --> 01:37:06,994
[SPEAKER_05]: You did talk about it last week.

1274
01:37:07,114 --> 01:37:07,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, never mind then.

1275
01:37:08,056 --> 01:37:08,978
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I finish?

1276
01:37:09,459 --> 01:37:10,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yes you can.

1277
01:37:10,861 --> 01:37:11,783
[SPEAKER_11]: You remember Hotel Dusk?

1278
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:19,464
[SPEAKER_11]: The company that made it, Sing, is over 200 million in debt.

1279
01:37:21,125 --> 01:37:29,490
[SPEAKER_11]: They also did Another Code, they did Town Factory for Little King Story, and Last Window.

1280
01:37:30,230 --> 01:37:36,334
[SPEAKER_03]: And we better buy some more of their copies of Again, which is coming out at the end of this month, because that was also by them, I think.

1281
01:37:36,774 --> 01:37:38,836
[SPEAKER_11]: They filed for bankruptcy on March 1st.

1282
01:37:38,856 --> 01:37:39,896
[SPEAKER_11]: 200 million yen.

1283
01:37:42,537 --> 01:37:44,758
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to sell 200 million copies of that game.

1284
01:37:44,798 --> 01:37:45,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you can do it.

1285
01:37:46,979 --> 01:37:55,024
[SPEAKER_11]: The final new character for Street Fighter 4 has been released, and it's a big red dude covered in oil, wearing what looks like a hat made out of Legos on his head.

1286
01:37:56,545 --> 01:38:01,387
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's a grappler, and he slides, and he's splashing oil everywhere.

1287
01:38:01,487 --> 01:38:04,189
[SPEAKER_11]: This is actually kind of splooge-worthy, so...

1288
01:38:05,724 --> 01:38:06,846
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta give props to Alan.

1289
01:38:06,886 --> 01:38:08,528
[SPEAKER_05]: He recognized what they were referencing.

1290
01:38:08,568 --> 01:38:09,849
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a Turkish oil wrestler.

1291
01:38:10,189 --> 01:38:19,660
[SPEAKER_05]: It's this big thing in other countries, like Turkey, where they douse themselves in what appears to be KY jelly type of substance and wrestle each other.

1292
01:38:20,241 --> 01:38:22,604
[SPEAKER_05]: It is pretty homo-rific, but no homo.

1293
01:38:23,885 --> 01:38:24,665
[SPEAKER_11]: I've heard of it.

1294
01:38:24,725 --> 01:38:27,267
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just the screen capture is like, dude, you're red.

1295
01:38:27,407 --> 01:38:29,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that Greco-Roman normally?

1296
01:38:29,328 --> 01:38:29,648
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

1297
01:38:29,748 --> 01:38:30,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that like Greco-Roman?

1298
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:31,149
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a Roman.

1299
01:38:31,589 --> 01:38:32,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I don't know.

1300
01:38:32,310 --> 01:38:35,992
[SPEAKER_05]: He told me to Google image search Turkish oil wrestling.

1301
01:38:36,572 --> 01:38:41,095
[SPEAKER_05]: And let's just say I got a lot of guys who didn't look quite as bad as that guy.

1302
01:38:42,415 --> 01:38:43,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1303
01:38:43,596 --> 01:38:45,077
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially not wearing a blue Lego hat.

1304
01:38:46,718 --> 01:38:49,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, I can never pronounce his last name right.

1305
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:49,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it Molyneux?

1306
01:38:54,247 --> 01:39:20,059
[SPEAKER_11]: whatever crazy guy who makes Fable yeah really basically he's saying that comparing Natal and Move he said Move is a good step in the right direction but it's not as big as Natal and he thinks he's not biased or anything well says first party developer for Microsoft he's saying that Move is going to be more for the casual market and Natal is going to be more for the immersive gamer

1307
01:39:22,354 --> 01:39:24,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Fable 3 will blow your mind!

1308
01:39:25,175 --> 01:39:26,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Except it won't.

1309
01:39:26,055 --> 01:39:28,236
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be exactly like the last two games.

1310
01:39:28,736 --> 01:39:32,477
[SPEAKER_03]: But he'll claim that it blows your mind.

1311
01:39:32,497 --> 01:39:33,078
[SPEAKER_03]: It blows you.

1312
01:39:33,098 --> 01:39:34,618
[SPEAKER_11]: You're supposed to have no heads up, though.

1313
01:39:34,998 --> 01:39:35,698
[SPEAKER_11]: No heads up display.

1314
01:39:38,759 --> 01:39:47,302
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm interested to see what the Natal link-in is, but they do say that Natal is not mandatory for Fable 3, which I also like.

1315
01:39:47,362 --> 01:39:48,842
[SPEAKER_05]: It will allow you to slap a bitch.

1316
01:39:49,203 --> 01:39:50,083
laughter

1317
01:39:55,942 --> 01:39:58,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh Loki, what would we do without you here at Orange Lounge Radio?

1318
01:39:58,945 --> 01:40:00,887
[SPEAKER_05]: We would die, that's what would happen, we would die.

1319
01:40:01,287 --> 01:40:02,308
[SPEAKER_05]: How about some Twitter topics?

1320
01:40:03,189 --> 01:40:03,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of death.

1321
01:40:05,070 --> 01:40:06,472
[SPEAKER_05]: No, actually we have some good questions tonight.

1322
01:40:06,492 --> 01:40:08,974
[SPEAKER_05]: We have some really good questions on the Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

1323
01:40:09,915 --> 01:40:17,281
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to allow, usually I don't allow more than one question a person, but MNZiba has a couple good ones tonight, so I will grant an exception.

1324
01:40:17,842 --> 01:40:20,685
[SPEAKER_05]: MNZiba asking, what is the deal with the Chocobo?

1325
01:40:20,765 --> 01:40:22,346
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the deal with the Chocobo?

1326
01:40:23,089 --> 01:40:25,990
[SPEAKER_05]: with the Chocobo in Final Fantasy XIII.

1327
01:40:26,510 --> 01:40:31,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a use for it or is it just there to look cute and to make it a Final Fantasy game?

1328
01:40:31,711 --> 01:40:33,132
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a little bit the second part.

1329
01:40:33,232 --> 01:40:43,435
[SPEAKER_05]: It is there to look cute and make it a little more of a Final Fantasy game because since there is no world map type thing, they had to incorporate a Chocobo, I think, another way.

1330
01:40:43,875 --> 01:40:47,376
[SPEAKER_05]: One big bitch about the game, by the way, is that there's no Final Fantasy victory music.

1331
01:40:47,536 --> 01:40:48,076
[SPEAKER_05]: You never hear...

1332
01:40:48,436 --> 01:40:50,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

1333
01:41:07,037 --> 01:41:07,937
[SPEAKER_05]: See if you can read what's going on.

1334
01:41:08,297 --> 01:41:11,378
[SPEAKER_05]: All the characters have their little profiles with the datalog.

1335
01:41:11,618 --> 01:41:13,979
[SPEAKER_05]: The Chocobo has his own entry.

1336
01:41:14,399 --> 01:41:18,760
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know if maybe the Chocobo becomes more relevant later in the story, but he's awfully cute.

1337
01:41:18,860 --> 01:41:19,941
[SPEAKER_10]: I want a fat Chocobo.

1338
01:41:20,741 --> 01:41:21,481
[SPEAKER_03]: To hold your items?

1339
01:41:21,701 --> 01:41:22,641
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, to hold my items.

1340
01:41:22,921 --> 01:41:24,802
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be awesome if he was a playable character later on.

1341
01:41:26,933 --> 01:41:31,735
[SPEAKER_05]: and MNZ, but since I'm allowing the second tweet tonight, says, this should be the game for the Sweet Off.

1342
01:41:32,476 --> 01:41:34,557
[SPEAKER_05]: The Swedish Armed Forces, the team test.

1343
01:41:34,577 --> 01:41:37,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember we were talking about the Sweet Off with one of our callers last week?

1344
01:41:37,538 --> 01:41:40,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's this, I've never even heard of this.

1345
01:41:40,559 --> 01:41:43,961
[SPEAKER_05]: We just got a link here to the Swedish Armed Forces team test.

1346
01:41:45,121 --> 01:41:48,163
[SPEAKER_05]: and I guess it's some type of online little ranking thing.

1347
01:41:48,223 --> 01:41:51,765
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have to look into this and see if it's appropriate for the Sweet Off but I don't know.

1348
01:41:51,785 --> 01:42:01,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Part of me is like the Sweet Off should happen with President Cat or Beatmania 2DX or something a little more showish or OLR Match Game.

1349
01:42:01,612 --> 01:42:04,273
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we have to do OLR Match Game for the Sweet Off.

1350
01:42:04,293 --> 01:42:07,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's just mandatory but I appreciate the suggestion.

1351
01:42:07,235 --> 01:42:07,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get me wrong.

1352
01:42:08,616 --> 01:42:16,859
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw links us to a story on 1UP about Ensemble and Pandemic talking about their company closures.

1353
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:19,961
[SPEAKER_05]: They're actually taking responsibility and blaming themselves.

1354
01:42:21,041 --> 01:42:25,863
[SPEAKER_05]: According to the 1UP article, Paul Bettner, he was an employee of Ensemble Studios for 12 years.

1355
01:42:25,903 --> 01:42:27,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, it was shut down by Microsoft in 2008.

1356
01:42:28,044 --> 01:42:30,465
[SPEAKER_05]: He blamed their own internal crunch culture.

1357
01:42:30,845 --> 01:42:48,634
[SPEAKER_05]: saying quote the reality is that every single game we shipped took twice as long as we said it was going to take and cost twice as much to make Microsoft is a public company they answer to their shareholders and we were simply too expensive kind of an interesting little article kind of interesting to hear folks taking responsibility for what happened

1358
01:42:49,714 --> 01:42:51,315
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a rarity nowadays.

1359
01:42:51,415 --> 01:42:53,176
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a rarity nowadays, but still kind of a bummer.

1360
01:42:53,556 --> 01:42:55,837
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, when the show is bad, it's never my fault.

1361
01:42:55,997 --> 01:42:57,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Always Loki's.

1362
01:42:58,438 --> 01:42:59,619
[SPEAKER_11]: That means it's never my fault either.

1363
01:43:00,199 --> 01:43:01,079
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a rarity nowadays.

1364
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:03,020
[SPEAKER_05]: I blame Shermie's butt.

1365
01:43:04,001 --> 01:43:07,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Nico Nico Chan links us to a website.

1366
01:43:07,182 --> 01:43:08,023
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this might be a...

1367
01:43:08,743 --> 01:43:10,724
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this might be a website plug, I don't know, but I'll read it.

1368
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:13,525
[SPEAKER_05]: PokemonRO.net, what do you think about it?

1369
01:43:13,985 --> 01:43:18,687
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Red Blue made from Ragnarok Online system and skills, but with a ton of customs.

1370
01:43:18,727 --> 01:43:19,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie apparently knows it.

1371
01:43:19,647 --> 01:43:19,867
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1372
01:43:20,308 --> 01:43:20,448
[SPEAKER_05]: And?

1373
01:43:20,648 --> 01:43:21,108
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll play.

1374
01:43:21,928 --> 01:43:22,528
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll play.

1375
01:43:23,069 --> 01:43:23,529
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll play.

1376
01:43:23,789 --> 01:43:25,089
[SPEAKER_05]: A++, we'll play again.

1377
01:43:26,110 --> 01:43:34,853
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now, right now, I hardly have time to play anything, but this I will when my brain works and I have time.

1378
01:43:34,893 --> 01:43:35,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Gonna make some time.

1379
01:43:36,234 --> 01:43:36,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Gonna make some time.

1380
01:43:37,310 --> 01:43:39,111
[SPEAKER_11]: in between killing the Klingons and Gorn.

1381
01:43:40,632 --> 01:43:45,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Spazinator PSN says, okay, since it's pie day, here's a random question.

1382
01:43:45,315 --> 01:43:47,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Pizza or Boston cream?

1383
01:43:48,117 --> 01:43:50,479
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I get what he's doing there because they call it pizza pie.

1384
01:43:50,739 --> 01:43:52,400
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't really call it pizza pie here.

1385
01:43:52,420 --> 01:43:54,061
[SPEAKER_05]: At least I never hear that term, but yeah.

1386
01:43:54,081 --> 01:43:54,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Boston cream.

1387
01:43:54,522 --> 01:43:55,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's less deep dish here.

1388
01:43:56,583 --> 01:43:57,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Boston cream.

1389
01:43:58,304 --> 01:44:04,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I do love Boston Cream Pies, but it's like, I'll still always have pumpkins, so I've gotta go for pizza.

1390
01:44:04,967 --> 01:44:08,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, if you're asking me one pie versus all of pizza, I've gotta go for pizza.

1391
01:44:08,508 --> 01:44:10,029
[SPEAKER_11]: And Boston Cream Pie, though, is more of a cake.

1392
01:44:11,869 --> 01:44:14,890
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, really, it's a cake with a cream layer in it.

1393
01:44:15,671 --> 01:44:17,511
[SPEAKER_05]: But you still elect Boston Cream over pizza.

1394
01:44:17,531 --> 01:44:19,312
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, I really love Boston Cream Pie.

1395
01:44:20,092 --> 01:44:21,373
[SPEAKER_11]: I had it for breakfast last week.

1396
01:44:22,516 --> 01:44:23,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1397
01:44:24,277 --> 01:44:29,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Ryan Belknap is wishing us a happy Pi Day, but he's also trying to imitate a spammer.

1398
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:30,360
[SPEAKER_05]: I see what you're doing there.

1399
01:44:30,921 --> 01:44:32,302
[SPEAKER_05]: These are Twitter folks.

1400
01:44:33,382 --> 01:44:38,525
[SPEAKER_05]: It's SSJ100Matt on Twitter, but his Twitter name is Matt Ostrofsky, which I always mispronounce.

1401
01:44:38,905 --> 01:44:42,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Love himself, Gene Simmons, will be voicing Guitar Hero 6.

1402
01:44:43,247 --> 01:44:44,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Could it be Guitar Hero Kiss?

1403
01:44:44,988 --> 01:44:47,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Somehow this missed the show tonight, but I remember reading about this.

1404
01:44:47,850 --> 01:44:49,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently Gene Simmons has said he's doing Guitar Hero 6.

1405
01:44:50,131 --> 01:44:53,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see him being the voice of Guitar Hero just because he said he's the voice of Guitar Hero.

1406
01:45:08,957 --> 01:45:09,698
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1407
01:45:28,075 --> 01:45:29,595
[SPEAKER_03]: He's whoring himself out, okay?

1408
01:45:29,715 --> 01:45:30,976
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really what it comes down to.

1409
01:45:32,076 --> 01:45:34,096
[SPEAKER_03]: He was on The Celebrity Apprentice, for heaven's sakes.

1410
01:45:34,156 --> 01:45:37,317
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's where celebrities go because they need attention.

1411
01:45:37,377 --> 01:45:37,957
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

1412
01:45:38,017 --> 01:45:38,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

1413
01:45:38,357 --> 01:45:39,817
[SPEAKER_03]: He can be in the next Guitar Hero game.

1414
01:45:39,857 --> 01:45:42,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Just don't be pissed off if he's singing Kelly Clarkson.

1415
01:45:42,578 --> 01:45:43,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't wait.

1416
01:45:43,258 --> 01:45:46,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't wait for the YouTubes of Gene Simmons singing Taylor Swift.

1417
01:45:47,159 --> 01:45:49,299
[SPEAKER_06]: You belong to me.

1418
01:45:50,259 --> 01:45:53,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, that was my Taylor Swift impression, by the way.

1419
01:45:55,501 --> 01:45:57,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Lady Gaga or something like that.

1420
01:46:00,007 --> 01:46:00,727
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be hilarious.

1421
01:46:00,767 --> 01:46:01,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't wait.

1422
01:46:01,107 --> 01:46:01,928
[SPEAKER_05]: In the full makeup.

1423
01:46:02,568 --> 01:46:05,049
[SPEAKER_06]: You belong to me.

1424
01:46:05,749 --> 01:46:06,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Taylor Swift sings like a Muppet.

1425
01:46:07,890 --> 01:46:12,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Lastly, on the OLR Twitter, Bricktone asks us, and this is kind of a fragmented question.

1426
01:46:12,911 --> 01:46:14,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, he was challenged with 140 characters.

1427
01:46:15,412 --> 01:46:17,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Support for PS3 Crash?

1428
01:46:17,233 --> 01:46:20,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't support the PS3 Crash, but...

1429
01:46:22,679 --> 01:46:24,360
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1430
01:46:46,525 --> 01:46:47,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1431
01:47:04,009 --> 01:47:05,609
[SPEAKER_05]: And lastly, what do you think of the Wiimote for PS3?

1432
01:47:05,809 --> 01:47:08,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, again, I think we talked about that a little bit earlier in the show.

1433
01:47:08,110 --> 01:47:12,351
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a necessary step for Sony, but it's an unnecessary peripheral for me to buy right now.

1434
01:47:12,471 --> 01:47:13,131
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where I'm at.

1435
01:47:13,411 --> 01:47:17,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Until I see that must-have game, I'm not sold.

1436
01:47:17,692 --> 01:47:26,634
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know what that must-have game is, but it's not like Sony can't create a new IP, because like LittleBigPlanet, hello, that is like a system seller PS3 game.

1437
01:47:26,654 --> 01:47:27,414
[SPEAKER_05]: It is that good.

1438
01:47:27,714 --> 01:47:29,735
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Uncharted is that good.

1439
01:47:29,835 --> 01:47:30,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of LittleBigPlanet, you still...

1440
01:47:31,075 --> 01:47:36,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see the video of how exactly the PlayStation Move works into LittleBigPlanet?

1441
01:47:36,321 --> 01:47:37,282
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna be honest, no.

1442
01:47:37,362 --> 01:47:39,144
[SPEAKER_05]: I just heard it's compatible.

1443
01:47:39,605 --> 01:47:40,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Did it look good?

1444
01:47:40,866 --> 01:47:41,006
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1445
01:47:41,346 --> 01:47:47,173
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically, you know how in Super Mario Galaxy the other players control a cursor or whatever and they can shoot shit?

1446
01:47:47,513 --> 01:47:51,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this one, you basically control a cursor and you can move shit.

1447
01:47:53,490 --> 01:47:54,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know what?

1448
01:47:54,550 --> 01:47:57,311
[SPEAKER_05]: It might add another element to level design, and I'm all for it.

1449
01:47:57,631 --> 01:48:05,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, where I give major, major props to Media Molecule and Sony is that they're not milking LittleBigPlanet for a 2 and 3 and 4.

1450
01:48:06,134 --> 01:48:10,315
[SPEAKER_05]: They keep making the first game better and making it so much more of a value.

1451
01:48:10,415 --> 01:48:11,856
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's hard to be mad.

1452
01:48:13,234 --> 01:48:13,615
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1453
01:48:13,735 --> 01:48:14,616
[SPEAKER_05]: It's another feature.

1454
01:48:14,736 --> 01:48:15,676
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just one I probably don't use.

1455
01:48:15,696 --> 01:48:20,480
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to think of it as a continuously evolving experience.

1456
01:48:20,500 --> 01:48:21,621
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I wish more games were like it.

1457
01:48:21,641 --> 01:48:22,221
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

1458
01:48:22,322 --> 01:48:26,325
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that they could do a little bit of Planet 2, but just release it as a download pack.

1459
01:48:26,885 --> 01:48:28,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, look, new levels set.

1460
01:48:28,486 --> 01:48:33,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think maybe just Mod Nation racers will probably have it too at some point?

1461
01:48:33,170 --> 01:48:39,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Just wasn't ready to show yet, like gripping the steering wheel with your, you know, not Wiimote, you know?

1462
01:48:39,755 --> 01:48:40,816
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure it's inevitable.

1463
01:48:42,464 --> 01:48:43,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for the tweets, guys.

1464
01:48:43,465 --> 01:48:45,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

1465
01:48:45,086 --> 01:48:45,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Give us a follow.

1466
01:48:45,806 --> 01:48:46,667
[SPEAKER_05]: We really appreciate it.

1467
01:48:46,967 --> 01:48:49,689
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, I also wanted to say this at some point in the show tonight.

1468
01:48:49,749 --> 01:48:54,412
[SPEAKER_05]: We really do appreciate five-star reviews on iTunes and people that help spread the word.

1469
01:48:54,652 --> 01:49:00,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you know we do say at the end of every show, you know, tell a friend or two about the show and help spread the word about Orange Launch Radio.

1470
01:49:00,796 --> 01:49:04,219
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really all we ask to continue doing this show for you guys.

1471
01:49:04,519 --> 01:49:10,163
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just wanted to say there were a couple of really, really nice reviews left on iTunes this week.

1472
01:49:10,223 --> 01:49:12,084
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to read them because they were very, very nice.

1473
01:49:12,464 --> 01:49:14,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Even with last week's show?

1474
01:49:15,208 --> 01:49:16,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Even with last week's show.

1475
01:49:16,209 --> 01:49:17,631
[SPEAKER_05]: These were both left in the past week.

1476
01:49:18,012 --> 01:49:21,196
[SPEAKER_05]: A short and sweet one from Bert777 saying, I love it.

1477
01:49:21,216 --> 01:49:22,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Been listening for a while.

1478
01:49:22,538 --> 01:49:25,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody into video games, give these awesome people a chance.

1479
01:49:25,042 --> 01:49:25,742
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you, Bert.

1480
01:49:26,524 --> 01:49:27,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Hope Ernie's doing well.

1481
01:49:28,366 --> 01:49:29,166
[SPEAKER_05]: But I want to read this one.

1482
01:49:29,186 --> 01:49:30,147
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just sweet.

1483
01:49:30,187 --> 01:49:33,910
[SPEAKER_05]: This gave me the awe feeling and really makes doing the show worthwhile.

1484
01:49:33,970 --> 01:49:40,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Shadow77 says, I've been listening to OLR for at least three years and over time they went from being a good podcast to an epic podcast.

1485
01:49:41,177 --> 01:49:44,700
[SPEAKER_05]: They are opinionated and well informed on video game matters and to top it off are really funny.

1486
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:50,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Over time they have honed their broadcasting skills and their radio voices and have become a podcast that I would actually pay money to hear.

1487
01:49:50,925 --> 01:49:52,826
[SPEAKER_05]: They do go off on tangents quite often though.

1488
01:49:52,927 --> 01:49:53,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Choo choo.

1489
01:49:53,847 --> 01:50:22,812
[SPEAKER_05]: this is a plus to me but always manage to wrap something up about video games into the subject they are always current about the video game industry and run the gamut on topics from reviews to previews to info on various video game developers and publishers to things random to describe the live show is something to experience and they actually pay attention to the chat room and take calls the community is also fairly active so I just wanted to say thank you because you know people take the time out to write these nice reviews and I realize yeah it's a little bit of ego stroking and so forth but I actually read that and it made me go

1490
01:50:23,152 --> 01:50:24,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Aw, that's really nice.

1491
01:50:24,193 --> 01:50:26,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, somebody didn't have to say all that, and they did.

1492
01:50:26,834 --> 01:50:29,755
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just wanted to share the awes.

1493
01:50:30,135 --> 01:50:30,775
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you very much.

1494
01:50:32,316 --> 01:50:33,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, those are five-star reviews from iTunes.

1495
01:50:34,077 --> 01:50:37,839
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, you know, all we ask... I realize not everybody's on the Apple bandwagon.

1496
01:50:37,899 --> 01:50:43,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, if I ask Loki to leave a five-star review on iTunes, he'd tell me to play hide-and-go-fuck myself from last week's show.

1497
01:50:43,741 --> 01:50:45,622
[SPEAKER_05]: So just tell friends about the show.

1498
01:50:45,662 --> 01:50:46,182
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all we ask.

1499
01:50:46,222 --> 01:50:47,503
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't go on iTunes.

1500
01:50:47,883 --> 01:50:48,403
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you don't.

1501
01:50:48,603 --> 01:50:50,744
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's against my... You can rate them on Zune, too.

1502
01:50:51,265 --> 01:50:52,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so you know.

1503
01:50:54,522 --> 01:50:55,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, let's move on.

1504
01:50:55,563 --> 01:50:57,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Some actual video gaming news.

1505
01:50:57,103 --> 01:51:01,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get past the ego stroking and get to some more video game news because there's plenty of it still to go.

1506
01:51:02,102 --> 01:51:06,144
[SPEAKER_03]: More stuff coming out from this week.

1507
01:51:07,504 --> 01:51:09,045
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually some information.

1508
01:51:09,065 --> 01:51:11,566
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked a little bit about Natal and whatnot.

1509
01:51:11,966 --> 01:51:15,007
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can't forget about XNA.

1510
01:51:15,728 --> 01:51:21,410
[SPEAKER_03]: XNA Game Studio 4.0 apparently is including support for Windows phones.

1511
01:51:22,290 --> 01:51:26,572
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're even going to be including some new features including...

1512
01:51:27,052 --> 01:51:32,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Gamertags, Avatar support, and achievements that you can unlock on your phone.

1513
01:51:33,475 --> 01:51:38,858
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, there's going to be games that you can use for unlocking achievements.

1514
01:51:39,238 --> 01:51:41,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of like an Xbox Live Arcade game.

1515
01:51:41,699 --> 01:51:46,462
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, you can unlock up to 200 Microsoft or Gamerscore points.

1516
01:51:47,362 --> 01:51:53,085
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess it's going to be displayed on your Xbox Live Gamertag profile.

1517
01:51:54,511 --> 01:51:54,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Achievement Whores

1518
01:52:21,499 --> 01:52:50,398
[SPEAKER_05]: well you know sometimes achievements like that gets people to buy the games well there was a whole study out of GDC again it's not on the show world tonight but there was a whole thing on achievements and it does motivate people to play games and there's a percentage of people it's a small percentage but a percentage that really try to go after every single achievement in a game you know and will buy games with achievements didn't they say too that games with really easy achievements especially in arcade will sell a little more often times

1519
01:52:51,810 --> 01:52:52,892
[SPEAKER_05]: So hey, why not?

1520
01:52:53,073 --> 01:52:58,944
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's a way to draw attention to the Windows phone, anything to pull the eyes away from Apple for a minute, I think is a good idea.

1521
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:01,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1522
01:53:02,741 --> 01:53:05,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Would this get you on board with a Windows phone though, Loki?

1523
01:53:05,441 --> 01:53:07,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Since I know you're not going to get an iPhone anytime soon.

1524
01:53:07,022 --> 01:53:09,102
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because the data plans on phones are too expensive.

1525
01:53:09,342 --> 01:53:17,224
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just... You know, if they brought down... If it was like $50 a month for unlimited data and everything, then maybe.

1526
01:53:17,244 --> 01:53:19,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's what I kind of pay for my phone right now.

1527
01:53:19,104 --> 01:53:21,625
[SPEAKER_03]: But even then, I don't use that many minutes right now.

1528
01:53:21,665 --> 01:53:27,887
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm actually thinking about going to a prepaid phones where I don't have to... You know, like $100 a year type stuff.

1529
01:53:28,087 --> 01:53:28,727
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, where...

1530
01:53:30,047 --> 01:53:34,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally, I'm lucky if I use 6 to 12 minutes a month.

1531
01:53:36,371 --> 01:53:40,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, somebody is teasing me yet again with the idea of a new Kid Icarus game.

1532
01:53:40,254 --> 01:53:43,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember about a year or two ago when we were convinced this was coming out at E3?

1533
01:53:43,676 --> 01:53:46,278
[SPEAKER_05]: We had the screenshots and everything, and it just didn't fucking happen?

1534
01:53:46,838 --> 01:53:47,299
[SPEAKER_05]: How sad.

1535
01:53:47,639 --> 01:53:57,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, again, we get teased, and you can kind of thank Kotaku for that, but really it was because they were interviewing Yoshio Sakamoto, who of course was one of the creators of Kid Icarus.

1536
01:53:57,666 --> 01:53:59,627
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess they cornered him at GDC or something.

1537
01:54:00,187 --> 01:54:15,978
[SPEAKER_05]: and basically he said in a nutshell that you know they're not opposed to bringing out Kid Icarus to the Wii they just don't know what to do here's the quote quote I don't know personally about any project underway regarding Kid Icarus but if so many of these people are interested in it and really want to see it on the Wii they should really speak up

1538
01:54:18,259 --> 01:54:18,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they deaf?

1539
01:54:18,999 --> 01:54:22,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think a lot of people have been speaking up for a while.

1540
01:54:22,180 --> 01:54:22,821
[SPEAKER_05]: But okay, whatever.

1541
01:54:23,181 --> 01:54:25,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we need to do a petition online?

1542
01:54:25,642 --> 01:54:26,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what needs to happen?

1543
01:54:27,382 --> 01:54:27,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Good gosh.

1544
01:54:28,163 --> 01:54:29,303
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure there's plenty already.

1545
01:54:30,924 --> 01:54:32,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, moving on with a quote.

1546
01:54:32,124 --> 01:54:39,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Quote, if we can find some sort of way to bring it to the Wii, a way to make the game for the Wii that makes sense, we would happily do so.

1547
01:54:39,668 --> 01:54:42,329
[SPEAKER_05]: But just keep in mind, it may not be me making the game.

1548
01:54:42,969 --> 01:54:45,110
[SPEAKER_05]: So in other words, he's admitting it might be somebody else.

1549
01:54:45,350 --> 01:55:04,055
[SPEAKER_05]: just like how Metroid Other M is in somebody else's hands and so forth honestly I think if they want to do a Kid Icarus game on the Wii why not just do like a souped up version a la even I hate to say it because I received this game so tepidly but maybe the Blaster Master game just a little more polished or the just like the Mario new Super Mario Bros.

1550
01:55:04,115 --> 01:55:13,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Wii you don't have to like totally reinvent Kid Icarus just you know make it a fancy looking 2D game with some new features that's all you really need to do I think

1551
01:55:16,505 --> 01:55:19,127
[SPEAKER_05]: I want the most epic Kid Icarus ever.

1552
01:55:37,140 --> 01:55:37,641
[SPEAKER_05]: I do too.

1553
01:55:38,181 --> 01:55:50,373
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and especially, you would think with God of War, which is another Greek mythology thing, doing very well on another platform, you think Nintendo would already have some ideas on how you can make the Greek mythology thing successful.

1554
01:55:50,793 --> 01:55:51,153
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

1555
01:55:51,213 --> 01:55:52,475
[SPEAKER_05]: How about Battle of Olympus, anyone?

1556
01:55:52,535 --> 01:55:53,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Battle of Olympus?

1557
01:55:53,355 --> 01:55:57,399
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, how about something else, though, that is kind of epic-ish?

1558
01:55:57,720 --> 01:55:57,920
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1559
01:55:58,837 --> 01:56:00,258
[SPEAKER_11]: Hanabi Festival!

1560
01:56:00,859 --> 01:56:01,819
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay!

1561
01:56:03,641 --> 01:56:07,824
[SPEAKER_11]: But Nintendo raised some prices for some of their games.

1562
01:56:08,725 --> 01:56:12,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Ironclad is now 1,000 Wii points instead of 900, and Lode Runner is 600 instead of 500.

1563
01:56:15,190 --> 01:56:29,159
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, there's Military Madness, um, for WiiWare, which will be a thousand Wii points, and then the rest is DSiWare, um, Pop Island, uh, Simply Mahjong, Simply Sudoku, um, each of those will be 200, uh...

1564
01:56:32,062 --> 01:56:38,550
[SPEAKER_11]: DSI Points 4 Travelers Play Spanish Elementary Masters Fantasy Card Adventure 800 DSI Points

1565
01:56:48,959 --> 01:56:49,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Wee!

1566
01:56:49,319 --> 01:56:57,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Seems like they got a lot of the big stuff out last year, but of course Rondo of Blood is kind of the big one that everybody's like, ooh, Rondo of Blood.

1567
01:56:57,605 --> 01:57:00,446
[SPEAKER_09]: That means I don't have to worry about accidentally scratching my disc.

1568
01:57:00,486 --> 01:57:02,228
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if that means it's going to come out here, too.

1569
01:57:02,328 --> 01:57:02,728
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope.

1570
01:57:02,808 --> 01:57:09,112
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you're reading it for Europe and what they get, but they sometimes get cooler stuff than we do, so I hope it means we're going to get it around the same time.

1571
01:57:09,312 --> 01:57:09,812
[SPEAKER_10]: Want!

1572
01:57:10,993 --> 01:57:13,715
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be, Dark Sakura, it could be tomorrow.

1573
01:57:14,235 --> 01:57:15,156
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be tomorrow.

1574
01:57:15,856 --> 01:57:16,797
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I know.

1575
01:57:18,556 --> 01:57:20,117
[SPEAKER_05]: I want next week to be here already.

1576
01:57:20,197 --> 01:57:21,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Not just because of PAX.

1577
01:57:21,178 --> 01:57:22,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Not this coming week, but the week after.

1578
01:57:22,919 --> 01:57:24,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Not just because of PAX East, but Microsoft Game Room.

1579
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:27,861
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen some of the clips from GDC for Microsoft Game Room.

1580
01:57:27,881 --> 01:57:28,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks kind of cool.

1581
01:57:29,422 --> 01:57:30,283
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited to try it.

1582
01:57:30,323 --> 01:57:33,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my question, though, about the Hanabi Festival.

1583
01:57:33,245 --> 01:57:35,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because you guys are getting all excited and everything.

1584
01:57:36,887 --> 01:57:41,449
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the years they did bring that stuff over here, but not last year, I don't think.

1585
01:57:41,789 --> 01:57:42,710
[SPEAKER_03]: It was only in Europe.

1586
01:57:43,584 --> 01:57:46,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it seems like they don't bring all the games over here.

1587
01:57:46,627 --> 01:57:56,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, I guess they did do a festival out of it, because I want to say they brought Sin and Punishment over here, which was a big deal, because in the back of their minds, they knew the sequel was coming.

1588
01:57:57,135 --> 01:58:01,559
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't know that yet, but they knew it was, so they brought that out during a similar thing here.

1589
01:58:01,579 --> 01:58:03,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Sin and Punishment came out over here, and I think Mario Bros.

1590
01:58:03,780 --> 01:58:04,641
[SPEAKER_03]: 2 did also.

1591
01:58:04,781 --> 01:58:06,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think you're right.

1592
01:58:06,422 --> 01:58:09,545
[SPEAKER_05]: The original Mario 2, you're right, was part of that too.

1593
01:58:09,585 --> 01:58:13,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe they'll do it again here, but I'm not going to hold my breath either.

1594
01:58:14,288 --> 01:58:14,728
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see.

1595
01:58:14,748 --> 01:58:17,449
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple more stories for you guys, then we're going to get to the mailbag.

1596
01:58:17,589 --> 01:58:27,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Well, this is kind of an interesting tie-in, but apparently Mafia 2 will feature vintage Playboys.

1597
01:58:27,891 --> 01:58:28,551
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

1598
01:58:29,051 --> 01:58:35,753
[SPEAKER_03]: 2K Games has announced that they've signed a license agreement with the Playboy magazine for, I guess they're going to have...

1599
01:58:37,854 --> 01:58:42,797
[SPEAKER_03]: 50 of the vintage covers and centerfolds inside the game when it's released.

1600
01:58:42,817 --> 01:58:46,319
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess you'll see vintage Playboys littered on the ground and stuff like that.

1601
01:58:47,480 --> 01:58:59,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I guess the Playboy collectibles won't show up until the later part of the game because I guess the game takes place during the 40s and 50s.

1602
01:58:59,928 --> 01:59:02,069
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently the magazine...

1603
01:59:03,070 --> 01:59:04,211
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1604
01:59:27,671 --> 01:59:27,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1605
01:59:28,452 --> 01:59:31,575
[SPEAKER_05]: And are they actual Playboy vintage covers?

1606
01:59:31,655 --> 01:59:32,175
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of cool.

1607
01:59:32,195 --> 01:59:33,717
[SPEAKER_03]: They will be the actual covers.

1608
01:59:34,017 --> 01:59:34,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1609
01:59:35,138 --> 01:59:40,383
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're gonna... I don't know if they have... It says they have the centerfolds as well, so I don't know if you get the cover in the centerfold.

1610
01:59:40,824 --> 01:59:42,566
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit of nudity for you, but...

1611
01:59:44,187 --> 01:59:44,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Neat.

1612
01:59:44,587 --> 01:59:48,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, adding some tits to your game always makes it sell a few more copies, so there you go.

1613
01:59:48,410 --> 01:59:54,314
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do believe that they had a character from Mafia 2 in the last digital fake game check.

1614
01:59:54,374 --> 01:59:55,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they still do that, huh?

1615
01:59:55,855 --> 01:59:56,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they still do it.

1616
01:59:56,875 --> 01:59:57,416
[SPEAKER_03]: The fake girls.

1617
01:59:57,736 --> 01:59:58,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Eh, it's retarded.

1618
01:59:58,496 --> 01:59:59,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a little silly.

1619
02:00:00,376 --> 02:00:11,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, on the PSP, maybe this system can render some nice looking titties, I don't know That should be the question we ask about a new engine You know how we always say with a new peripheral, what's the time to penis?

1620
02:00:12,392 --> 02:00:15,517
[SPEAKER_05]: With new game engines, we should always ask, what's the time for realistic boobs?

1621
02:00:16,057 --> 02:00:16,358
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know

1622
02:00:16,738 --> 02:00:19,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, I think this system is very capable of doing it.

1623
02:00:19,600 --> 02:00:20,901
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the Fire Engine.

1624
02:00:20,921 --> 02:00:23,063
[SPEAKER_05]: That's P-H-Y-R-E Engine.

1625
02:00:23,923 --> 02:00:27,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, this is a tool that's used for creating PS3 games.

1626
02:00:27,166 --> 02:00:30,228
[SPEAKER_05]: It was used to make Critter Crunch, Flower, Shatter.

1627
02:00:30,528 --> 02:00:33,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, apparently now this is going to be compatible with the PSP.

1628
02:00:34,431 --> 02:00:40,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Big announcement at Game Developers Conference, which makes sense because the people developing games want to know that they can make games like Critter Crunch on the PSP.

1629
02:00:40,815 --> 02:00:41,316
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta say...

1630
02:00:42,031 --> 02:00:43,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Flower, awesome looking game.

1631
02:00:44,032 --> 02:00:47,874
[SPEAKER_05]: That is one of the most beautiful games you will play on a next-gen system, period.

1632
02:00:48,294 --> 02:00:50,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Critter Crunch looks like a freaking cartoon.

1633
02:00:51,075 --> 02:00:51,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Really well done.

1634
02:00:51,715 --> 02:00:54,917
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of exciting to hear that this Fire Engine is coming to the PSP.

1635
02:00:56,137 --> 02:01:11,304
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the VPs of technology, Taji Yutaka, said, Fire Engine for PSP was developed in response to requests from the game developer community, and we hope that the release of the PSP version demonstrates our commitment and support for game developers on all platforms.

1636
02:01:11,704 --> 02:01:17,249
[SPEAKER_05]: begin counting down the time until Critter Crunch and Flower are announced on the PSP.

1637
02:01:17,529 --> 02:01:24,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'll bet you anything, both of those games being as well-received as they were, getting PSP ports in a matter of three, two, one.

1638
02:01:25,316 --> 02:01:26,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, wait for E3.

1639
02:01:27,658 --> 02:01:28,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow.

1640
02:01:29,153 --> 02:01:33,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Now's the part of the show where DarkSakura is going to take an adventure into the mailbag.

1641
02:01:33,096 --> 02:01:35,938
[SPEAKER_05]: She's going to jump in, pull out some emails, and read them for you here.

1642
02:01:36,579 --> 02:01:37,340
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the mailbag.

1643
02:01:37,480 --> 02:01:43,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com DarkSakura, who's emailing us this week?

1644
02:01:43,945 --> 02:01:44,765
[SPEAKER_11]: Two from Robaba.

1645
02:01:46,776 --> 02:01:57,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that the following terms are allowed in Xbox Live gamer tags, lesbian, gay, bi, transgender, straight, I think that Microsoft has the golden opportunity for avatar clothing and props of the LGBT.

1646
02:01:57,904 --> 02:02:01,047
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not an official 2010 prediction, but I'm pretty sure they will.

1647
02:02:01,587 --> 02:02:03,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Any takers or am I taking too much for granted?

1648
02:02:04,689 --> 02:02:06,451
[SPEAKER_11]: In other news, did you hear about Washington, D.C.

1649
02:02:06,511 --> 02:02:07,491
[SPEAKER_11]: has made gay marriage legal?

1650
02:02:08,252 --> 02:02:10,594
[SPEAKER_11]: Next thing you know, some guy will try to marry his virtual girlfriend.

1651
02:02:10,694 --> 02:02:11,074
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wait.

1652
02:02:12,866 --> 02:02:15,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I did hear about DC making it legal.

1653
02:02:15,308 --> 02:02:16,610
[SPEAKER_05]: So congratulations, DC.

1654
02:02:16,670 --> 02:02:22,154
[SPEAKER_05]: And I made a mistake because I tweeted about it when it happens and I was like, what state's going to be next?

1655
02:02:22,214 --> 02:02:22,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, guys.

1656
02:02:23,015 --> 02:02:24,396
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time to get the other states on board.

1657
02:02:24,416 --> 02:02:29,120
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I realized like literally five seconds after hitting submit, I was like, oh, DC's not a state.

1658
02:02:29,621 --> 02:02:33,284
[SPEAKER_05]: But still, it's an important part of the nation, obviously.

1659
02:02:33,804 --> 02:02:37,287
[SPEAKER_05]: And very glad to hear that they have stopped marriage discrimination.

1660
02:02:37,928 --> 02:02:38,048
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

1661
02:02:38,683 --> 02:02:39,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Good for them.

1662
02:02:39,884 --> 02:02:48,190
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as the other part of that, the part relating to gaming more about how long before I can get a rainbow sticker or a rainbow belt for my character, I don't know.

1663
02:02:48,690 --> 02:02:53,814
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a lot of it is about supply and demand and I don't know if there's just a huge demand for that.

1664
02:02:54,435 --> 02:02:57,817
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that Microsoft's gonna be really trying to sell that anytime soon.

1665
02:02:57,917 --> 02:02:58,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1666
02:02:58,338 --> 02:02:59,498
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would be a little while.

1667
02:03:00,299 --> 02:03:06,104
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't think there's enough out there in the Avatar marketplace where they need that stuff right now.

1668
02:03:06,204 --> 02:03:09,647
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, yeah, they have sports jerseys, but I don't know.

1669
02:03:10,748 --> 02:03:16,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Then again, they had the politically motivated icons a couple years ago when the 08 election happened.

1670
02:03:16,313 --> 02:03:21,978
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say they had their own little Xbox poll because there were Obama icons and McCain icons.

1671
02:03:22,418 --> 02:03:22,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

1672
02:03:22,678 --> 02:03:23,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I crazy?

1673
02:03:23,259 --> 02:03:26,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't there some type of unscientific poll they did?

1674
02:03:27,683 --> 02:03:28,023
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1675
02:03:29,437 --> 02:03:34,886
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if they'd want to do such a social issue on the marketplace I don't realistically see that happening

1676
02:03:35,536 --> 02:03:36,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no.

1677
02:03:36,537 --> 02:03:42,802
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, from the Disney Parks log, the monorails are going to feature Tron Legacy art.

1678
02:03:43,883 --> 02:03:44,503
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty cool.

1679
02:03:44,703 --> 02:03:45,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

1680
02:03:45,284 --> 02:03:49,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, all the Disney Parks are going to be Tron-tronatized?

1681
02:03:49,307 --> 02:03:50,608
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking at the Disney Parks.

1682
02:03:50,908 --> 02:03:52,649
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the... It's Disney World.

1683
02:03:53,450 --> 02:03:53,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.

1684
02:03:53,850 --> 02:03:54,371
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so cool.

1685
02:03:55,151 --> 02:04:00,075
[SPEAKER_05]: The monorails at Disneyland just got redone not that long ago, so I can't believe they'd be doing them again.

1686
02:04:00,095 --> 02:04:01,396
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell me this picture's not sweet.

1687
02:04:01,736 --> 02:04:04,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's just like a little paint job on the outside.

1688
02:04:04,178 --> 02:04:05,039
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still pretty cool, though.

1689
02:04:05,709 --> 02:04:07,214
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's pretty neat.

1690
02:04:07,415 --> 02:04:07,916
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what they need?

1691
02:04:07,936 --> 02:04:09,180
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be even cooler if they did.

1692
02:04:09,782 --> 02:04:10,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Noby Noby Boy.

1693
02:04:12,907 --> 02:04:16,970
[SPEAKER_05]: No, seriously though, speaking of Tron and Disneyland, because I can bring this back on point.

1694
02:04:17,330 --> 02:04:23,674
[SPEAKER_05]: The coolest fucking ride I remember from when I was a kid, the People Mover featuring Tron.

1695
02:04:24,215 --> 02:04:34,842
[SPEAKER_05]: They had the People Mover, which they had for years and years, but in the early 80s when the movie came out, there was a section of it that was the super speed tunnel, where basically they projected imageries of Tron really fast on the wall.

1696
02:04:35,142 --> 02:04:36,403
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was a visual trick.

1697
02:04:36,423 --> 02:04:40,406
[SPEAKER_05]: It was an optical illusion that made you feel like you were going like 60 miles an hour in this tunnel.

1698
02:04:40,626 --> 02:04:40,966
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.

1699
02:05:07,618 --> 02:05:11,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, there was the Rocket Rods, which were really super fast.

1700
02:05:11,621 --> 02:05:14,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Still had the Tron Tunnel, but it was like, SHOOM!

1701
02:05:14,183 --> 02:05:16,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Through the Tron Tunnel, and it was hard to see anything.

1702
02:05:18,446 --> 02:05:19,828
[SPEAKER_03]: I never rode Rocket Rods, sadly.

1703
02:05:19,848 --> 02:05:20,648
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't go to Disneyland for many years.

1704
02:05:20,668 --> 02:05:24,231
[SPEAKER_03]: But, someone also somehow managed to fall out of that thing and died.

1705
02:05:24,711 --> 02:05:26,693
[SPEAKER_03]: So, people are dumb.

1706
02:05:27,113 --> 02:05:28,234
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it comes down to.

1707
02:05:28,254 --> 02:05:31,757
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why they don't have the gondolas anymore, because someone fell out of it and died.

1708
02:05:32,257 --> 02:05:36,981
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always people acting like jackasses, falling out of things and dying.

1709
02:05:37,902 --> 02:05:40,705
[SPEAKER_05]: The chat room has a request for me real quick here.

1710
02:05:41,265 --> 02:05:44,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a genuine, bonafide, electrified six-car monorail.

1711
02:05:44,569 --> 02:05:47,392
[SPEAKER_01]: When I say monorail, what's it called?

1712
02:05:47,552 --> 02:05:48,113
[SPEAKER_01]: Monorail.

1713
02:05:48,153 --> 02:05:49,814
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, monorail.

1714
02:05:49,894 --> 02:05:50,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Monorail.

1715
02:05:52,853 --> 02:05:54,814
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear those things are awfully loud.

1716
02:05:54,874 --> 02:05:56,776
[SPEAKER_01]: It flies as softly as a cloud.

1717
02:05:56,976 --> 02:05:58,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a chance the track could bend?

1718
02:05:59,097 --> 02:06:00,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Not on your life, my Hindu friend.

1719
02:06:01,039 --> 02:06:03,000
[SPEAKER_01]: What about us brain-dead slobs?

1720
02:06:03,140 --> 02:06:04,962
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be given cushy jobs.

1721
02:06:05,102 --> 02:06:06,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you sent here by the devil?

1722
02:06:07,103 --> 02:06:08,804
[SPEAKER_01]: No, good sir, I'm on the level.

1723
02:06:08,964 --> 02:06:10,906
[SPEAKER_01]: The ring came off my pudding can.

1724
02:06:11,126 --> 02:06:12,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Take my penknife, my good man.

1725
02:06:12,887 --> 02:06:14,929
[SPEAKER_01]: I swear it's Springfield's only choice.

1726
02:06:14,949 --> 02:06:16,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw up your hands and raise your voice.

1727
02:06:17,250 --> 02:06:18,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Mother Earth!

1728
02:06:18,131 --> 02:06:19,052
[SPEAKER_01]: What's it called?

1729
02:06:19,212 --> 02:06:20,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Mother Earth!

1730
02:06:20,252 --> 02:06:21,173
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again.

1731
02:06:21,253 --> 02:06:21,874
Mother Earth!

1732
02:06:25,268 --> 02:06:25,809
[SPEAKER_10]: Manil!

1733
02:06:25,889 --> 02:06:26,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Manil!

1734
02:06:26,290 --> 02:06:26,610
[SPEAKER_10]: Manil!

1735
02:06:26,630 --> 02:06:26,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Manil!

1736
02:06:27,051 --> 02:06:27,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Manil!

1737
02:06:27,852 --> 02:06:28,333
[SPEAKER_10]: Manil!

1738
02:06:28,353 --> 02:06:28,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Manil!

1739
02:06:40,250 --> 02:06:41,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Phil Hartman was a great man.

1740
02:06:42,992 --> 02:06:43,472
[SPEAKER_05]: He's missed.

1741
02:06:44,573 --> 02:06:44,913
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1742
02:06:45,734 --> 02:06:47,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, sorry for the tangent.

1743
02:06:47,675 --> 02:06:48,756
[SPEAKER_11]: More emails, please?

1744
02:06:49,076 --> 02:06:49,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1745
02:06:50,237 --> 02:06:50,957
[SPEAKER_11]: The Twitch?

1746
02:06:50,977 --> 02:06:51,178
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1747
02:06:51,198 --> 02:06:52,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully they involve monorails.

1748
02:06:53,179 --> 02:06:55,240
[SPEAKER_11]: Good morning, Orange Lounge Radio.

1749
02:06:55,681 --> 02:06:57,342
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Jetus writing in again.

1750
02:06:57,982 --> 02:07:02,865
[SPEAKER_11]: I have quite a few things to cover today, so first I'd like to thank DarkSakura for reading my previous long email and this one as well.

1751
02:07:02,925 --> 02:07:03,786
[SPEAKER_11]: I really appreciate it.

1752
02:07:04,386 --> 02:07:08,909
[SPEAKER_11]: I am also sorry for any spelling errors or grammatical faults in my letters, which there are undoubtedly many.

1753
02:07:09,009 --> 02:07:09,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but you're forgiven.

1754
02:07:10,630 --> 02:07:11,891
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, on to more pressing matters.

1755
02:07:12,311 --> 02:07:14,071
[SPEAKER_11]: Ake Ripper is THE Swede.

1756
02:07:14,772 --> 02:07:19,393
[SPEAKER_11]: I should be the OTHER Swede, since I am still just a private in the UL Army.

1757
02:07:19,753 --> 02:07:21,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Aw, don't give up like that.

1758
02:07:21,514 --> 02:07:23,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, where's my epic battle?

1759
02:07:23,675 --> 02:07:25,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's my Swede throwdown?

1760
02:07:25,175 --> 02:07:26,176
[SPEAKER_11]: Did I finish my email wrong?

1761
02:07:26,236 --> 02:07:26,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, fine.

1762
02:07:27,688 --> 02:07:30,931
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of respect goes out to Aki Ripper and his ability to call in so often.

1763
02:07:31,071 --> 02:07:34,233
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm still quite impressed that he manages to stay up for so long every week.

1764
02:07:35,154 --> 02:07:38,056
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, time for something that actually relates to gaming.

1765
02:07:38,837 --> 02:07:41,759
[SPEAKER_11]: As we all know, the world is in a state of economic turmoil.

1766
02:07:41,900 --> 02:07:51,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Hundreds and thousands of developers are being fired, studios are getting shut down, and the debate of piracy and DRM is getting more attention around the globe as we've heard on the last few shows.

1767
02:07:52,588 --> 02:07:56,411
[SPEAKER_11]: But how is this impacting the gaming world on a larger scale?

1768
02:07:56,631 --> 02:07:57,132
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll tell you how.

1769
02:07:58,740 --> 02:07:59,240
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

1770
02:08:20,032 --> 02:08:20,792
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

1771
02:08:40,922 --> 02:08:41,182
[SPEAKER_11]: Bioshock 2

1772
02:09:01,482 --> 02:09:05,866
[SPEAKER_11]: What made both of those games so amazing was that there was no expectation of what the games would be about.

1773
02:09:06,366 --> 02:09:13,852
[SPEAKER_11]: The storytelling in both of these were innovative, the protagonists intriguing, and the setting unique, which really made for a game experience like no other.

1774
02:09:14,353 --> 02:09:20,017
[SPEAKER_11]: With this in mind, isn't it sad that there is a Bioshock 2 already out and that Portal 2 is on its way?

1775
02:09:20,477 --> 02:09:27,143
[SPEAKER_11]: Have we really reached so low that any new franchise gets 80 or more Metacritic score gets placed on the sequel bandwagon?

1776
02:09:27,683 --> 02:09:29,066
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this really what us gamers want?

1777
02:09:29,406 --> 02:09:31,289
[SPEAKER_11]: I will have to say I am excited about Hordal 2.

1778
02:09:33,092 --> 02:10:01,657
[SPEAKER_11]: I get his point though I get the point but I do want more Portal goodness I think though that some of us are just like we have such awesome experiences with some of these games that we want more of that It's a matter of whether they need to make the sequel or not Some sequels are actually pretty good and some sequels are just kind of we put it out because we want more money I've not been hearing the most friendly feedback regarding Bioshock 2 that a lot of folks are complaining it does feel like a cash cow of the first game Yeah

1779
02:10:02,017 --> 02:10:31,216
[SPEAKER_11]: Bioshock was great but there have been some really good original games Little Big Planet I was talking about earlier, Bayonetta Bayonetta was really good or the original Mass Effect I'm saying for sequels though but even original IPs there's been a lot of really good ones in the past year Blur looks like it's going to be great there's some split second to finish the email out I guess I'm just ranting at this point so I will ask another question regarding new IPs when do you think Blizzard will release a game with a new IP?

1780
02:10:32,526 --> 02:10:32,806
[SPEAKER_05]: SeaCraft

1781
02:10:50,547 --> 02:11:17,562
[SPEAKER_05]: I think once you see the dust settle with Star Trek Starcraft and the World of Warcraft Cataclysm and Diablo 3 is kind of their focus I think you'll start to get some rumblings of what they're doing next and my gut tells me it's going to be an MMO and I'll go so far to say it's an MMO but not like a Warcraft MMO like something kind of different like a Tabula Rasa MMO because you know how Tabula Rasa was like a shooter?

1782
02:11:18,682 --> 02:11:20,704
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're going to go a different route with the MMO.

1783
02:11:20,764 --> 02:11:23,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Why make a copy of Warcraft when they have Warcraft?

1784
02:11:23,385 --> 02:11:26,027
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're going to go with an MMO that's different.

1785
02:11:27,088 --> 02:11:27,708
[SPEAKER_05]: If that makes sense.

1786
02:11:30,490 --> 02:11:34,273
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, looking forward to the show and your responses, Gditz.

1787
02:11:34,313 --> 02:11:34,593
[SPEAKER_11]: P.S.

1788
02:11:34,733 --> 02:11:37,896
[SPEAKER_11]: I will most likely be listening live to the next OLR, the one on March 21st.

1789
02:11:37,916 --> 02:11:38,136
[SPEAKER_11]: Call us!

1790
02:11:41,092 --> 02:11:43,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, maybe we should have our match game off that week.

1791
02:11:43,194 --> 02:11:43,474
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1792
02:11:43,494 --> 02:11:43,835
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1793
02:11:44,155 --> 02:11:45,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I can plan a match game.

1794
02:11:45,096 --> 02:11:46,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you're not going to be here next week.

1795
02:11:46,537 --> 02:11:47,438
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'll be here.

1796
02:11:47,458 --> 02:11:47,998
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be late.

1797
02:11:48,199 --> 02:11:48,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you'll be late.

1798
02:11:48,779 --> 02:11:49,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1799
02:11:49,180 --> 02:11:50,421
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to go to a Seder.

1800
02:11:50,801 --> 02:11:51,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1801
02:11:51,041 --> 02:11:53,003
[SPEAKER_05]: So, well, then what time do you get back from those?

1802
02:11:53,023 --> 02:11:53,824
[SPEAKER_05]: About 7, 8?

1803
02:11:54,745 --> 02:11:55,345
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe earlier.

1804
02:11:55,505 --> 02:11:55,766
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1805
02:11:55,826 --> 02:11:56,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

1806
02:11:56,446 --> 02:11:58,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we should be able to do a match game in Part B. Yeah.

1807
02:11:59,031 --> 02:11:59,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, OLR.

1808
02:12:00,192 --> 02:12:01,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, here's the deal.

1809
02:12:01,153 --> 02:12:05,818
[SPEAKER_11]: About a month ago, I wrote in about Silent Hill Shattered Memories and DarkSakura, the kind, loving woman she is.

1810
02:12:06,098 --> 02:12:06,538
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I know.

1811
02:12:07,039 --> 02:12:09,181
[SPEAKER_11]: Told me flat out to play one of the originals.

1812
02:12:09,822 --> 02:12:11,123
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I'm getting to my point here.

1813
02:12:11,223 --> 02:12:17,089
[SPEAKER_11]: I bought Silent Hill 2 just a couple of days ago, but I could have gotten a Silent Hill 4 The Room.

1814
02:12:17,429 --> 02:12:22,294
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was wondering, did I pass up a great game for a load of crap, or are they both equally good, and should I just shut the hell up now?

1815
02:12:23,034 --> 02:12:24,315
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, they're different kinds of good.

1816
02:12:24,335 --> 02:12:27,218
[SPEAKER_11]: Silent Hill 4 has a very different kind of game.

1817
02:12:27,258 --> 02:12:28,198
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, what was the other game?

1818
02:12:28,318 --> 02:12:28,919
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard The Room.

1819
02:12:28,939 --> 02:12:32,262
[SPEAKER_11]: It got Silent Hill 2, but passed up Silent Hill 4 to get it.

1820
02:12:33,463 --> 02:12:34,443
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you made the good choice.

1821
02:12:34,583 --> 02:12:38,667
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, yeah, if you haven't played either, I think you made the better choice with 2.

1822
02:12:38,747 --> 02:12:44,651
[SPEAKER_05]: I think 2 is the one that's very iconic of the series, although a lot of folks are partial to 3 and the original as well.

1823
02:12:44,952 --> 02:12:49,015
[SPEAKER_11]: I personally am partial to 3, and I still say play 2 first.

1824
02:12:51,125 --> 02:13:07,097
[SPEAKER_05]: 4 is not bad by any means I think it got raised a little bit by critics too harsh I think it's better than that but I think also it's a little obvious that 4 was intended to be a different game in the beginning but as far as how they're related 3 is more of a sequel to 1

1825
02:13:09,427 --> 02:13:12,110
[SPEAKER_11]: and 4 follows some of the story points from 2.

1826
02:13:12,731 --> 02:13:14,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, 4 was just going to be The Room.

1827
02:13:14,913 --> 02:13:21,500
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a new horror franchise they were doing called The Room and they ended up, you know, it's kind of Silent Hill-ish so let's make it Silent Hill.

1828
02:13:22,941 --> 02:13:23,622
[SPEAKER_11]: But it worked.

1829
02:13:24,323 --> 02:13:25,324
[SPEAKER_11]: It really did work.

1830
02:13:25,404 --> 02:13:25,684
[SPEAKER_05]: It did.

1831
02:13:25,784 --> 02:13:26,565
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a good game.

1832
02:13:26,965 --> 02:13:30,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Horribly underrated by the community at whole.

1833
02:13:30,389 --> 02:13:31,110
[SPEAKER_11]: The part with the big head.

1834
02:13:32,239 --> 02:13:34,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, I screamed like a little girl when I played that.

1835
02:13:34,302 --> 02:13:35,884
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Loki was there.

1836
02:13:36,044 --> 02:13:44,456
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember falling down and there were these big monster two-headed baby things in the water prison or whatever and I screamed like a girl and Loki said, what the hell are you doing?

1837
02:13:44,857 --> 02:13:46,459
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, I'm playing Silent Hill and it's scary.

1838
02:13:49,834 --> 02:13:53,516
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so yeah, they're both equally good, but you did a good thing by buying Silent Hill 2.

1839
02:13:54,156 --> 02:13:59,859
[SPEAKER_11]: On another note, my friend brought up a good point today about Max Payne 3, which brings me to another question.

1840
02:14:00,460 --> 02:14:05,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you guys know whether or not they're going to bring back the comic panels for cutscenes, or are we all fucked for that?

1841
02:14:06,023 --> 02:14:07,644
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I think, I don't know.

1842
02:14:08,621 --> 02:14:14,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, a little early to tell, honestly, but hey, you could always have the digital comics on PSP.

1843
02:14:14,383 --> 02:14:14,863
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know.

1844
02:14:15,003 --> 02:14:17,864
[SPEAKER_05]: They may make a comic out of it specifically for PSP.

1845
02:14:17,884 --> 02:14:19,284
[SPEAKER_05]: It would certainly lend itself well to that.

1846
02:14:20,044 --> 02:14:23,025
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I thank you for reading my email, and if you didn't, why the fuck not?

1847
02:14:24,006 --> 02:14:25,026
[SPEAKER_11]: You're a loyal listener.

1848
02:14:25,146 --> 02:14:31,088
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll just say, I'm not going to do your whole name, Haseo, from northern Minnesota, the land of the, oh my god, it's so fucking windy.

1849
02:14:31,488 --> 02:14:32,088
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, muddy.

1850
02:14:32,308 --> 02:14:32,568
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

1851
02:14:33,529 --> 02:14:37,550
[SPEAKER_05]: I like listeners to get a little bit of attitude with us, and if you didn't read this email, why the fuck not?

1852
02:14:37,610 --> 02:14:37,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Meow.

1853
02:14:39,383 --> 02:14:41,164
[SPEAKER_05]: I like emails that get a little sassy with us.

1854
02:14:42,024 --> 02:14:42,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job.

1855
02:14:42,585 --> 02:14:44,846
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, we got another, another, another.

1856
02:14:44,886 --> 02:14:46,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Did he text us really quick?

1857
02:14:46,307 --> 02:14:46,567
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1858
02:14:46,767 --> 02:14:47,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1859
02:14:47,127 --> 02:14:48,328
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, one more message.

1860
02:14:48,388 --> 02:14:54,652
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a way to get memory from a PS2, I guess memory card, to a PS1?

1861
02:14:56,773 --> 02:14:58,994
[SPEAKER_11]: Because those are a bitch to find without going online.

1862
02:15:01,395 --> 02:15:04,317
[SPEAKER_11]: To a PSP and onto a PS3 without the memory card adapter.

1863
02:15:05,586 --> 02:15:06,967
[SPEAKER_05]: On to a PS3?

1864
02:15:07,107 --> 02:15:08,468
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think you need the adapter.

1865
02:15:08,488 --> 02:15:19,275
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're going from PS1 to PS2, a PS2 will read the cards from one, and you can even put that data on a PS2 card, but only as like a carrier.

1866
02:15:19,575 --> 02:15:23,397
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't put a PS2 card in a PS1 under any reason.

1867
02:15:23,797 --> 02:15:33,043
[SPEAKER_05]: So the only thing you could do, you could put a PS1 card in a PS2, but unfortunately it ain't going to do you a lick of good without the transmitter cable, unfortunately.

1868
02:15:33,243 --> 02:15:33,984
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just the way it is.

1869
02:15:34,804 --> 02:15:36,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Oopsies.

1870
02:15:36,385 --> 02:15:38,306
[SPEAKER_05]: You might be able to.

1871
02:15:38,366 --> 02:15:39,206
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if this will work.

1872
02:15:39,226 --> 02:15:40,527
[SPEAKER_05]: You might have to do some research on this.

1873
02:15:40,887 --> 02:15:47,091
[SPEAKER_05]: You might be able to get something that lets you put your PS1 data on the PC and then you could use a USB stick to do it.

1874
02:15:47,591 --> 02:15:50,393
[SPEAKER_05]: That I think is possible, but I can't remember.

1875
02:15:51,173 --> 02:15:55,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but saves on the PC had different formats and stuff, so it might not work.

1876
02:15:55,675 --> 02:15:58,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Because remember, there's like DexDrive formats and stuff.

1877
02:15:58,637 --> 02:16:01,759
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this from back in the day when I used to do edit hacking.

1878
02:16:02,995 --> 02:16:05,036
[SPEAKER_05]: You might have to spend the money to get the cable, dude.

1879
02:16:05,056 --> 02:16:05,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

1880
02:16:06,136 --> 02:16:06,437
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1881
02:16:06,757 --> 02:16:08,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's get into some angst.

1882
02:16:09,538 --> 02:16:16,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes there are things that happen in the world that make us angry, and we always do this segment every week to just get it out of our system so we can be the happy hosts.

1883
02:16:17,641 --> 02:16:18,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, here's the leak.

1884
02:16:18,342 --> 02:16:18,382
Um...

1885
02:16:34,321 --> 02:16:36,122
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I was really trying to think of one.

1886
02:16:37,183 --> 02:16:44,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, this is going to require some backstory and it is a little bit of family goings on for me.

1887
02:16:48,985 --> 02:16:55,348
[SPEAKER_11]: My brother's girlfriend and her mother were found dead on Monday in Silver Hill, Alabama.

1888
02:16:56,829 --> 02:17:09,194
[SPEAKER_11]: So if anyone in the area who knows them don't, you know, say you heard anything... Well, I mean, I just... It's not, I guess, so much of a fuck you type of thing.

1889
02:17:09,314 --> 02:17:12,096
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just more of a regrettable thing.

1890
02:17:13,716 --> 02:17:14,897
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd actually have to say...

1891
02:17:16,423 --> 02:17:25,486
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone, and Nina, they actually don't know if it, the whole theory is that it's carbon monoxide poisoning what killed them in their, at the mobile home they lived in.

1892
02:17:25,946 --> 02:17:29,407
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the last anyone heard anything was Friday.

1893
02:17:30,227 --> 02:17:31,828
[SPEAKER_11]: And Matt didn't find out.

1894
02:17:31,888 --> 02:17:34,049
[SPEAKER_11]: No one found out until Monday when they found them.

1895
02:17:34,749 --> 02:17:41,671
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm just saying, there's no excuse not to have a carbon monoxide tester, even if that wasn't the cause.

1896
02:17:41,831 --> 02:17:42,811
[SPEAKER_11]: It's inconclusive right now.

1897
02:17:43,312 --> 02:17:44,472
[SPEAKER_11]: They're treating it as a homicide.

1898
02:17:45,152 --> 02:17:53,138
[SPEAKER_11]: But even so, if it was carbon monoxide or some type of gas monitoring or anything, there really shouldn't be any excuse that there's not a way to monitor that.

1899
02:17:53,238 --> 02:17:58,621
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd say everyone, your homes and your health and your lives are that important.

1900
02:17:59,022 --> 02:18:01,183
[SPEAKER_11]: You should invest a little bit in monitoring.

1901
02:18:01,263 --> 02:18:06,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't they sell, and if they don't, why not, smoke detectors that double as carbon monoxide detectors?

1902
02:18:06,506 --> 02:18:07,307
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good thing to have.

1903
02:18:07,547 --> 02:18:10,429
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how they regulate smoke detectors in public?

1904
02:18:10,449 --> 02:18:12,790
[SPEAKER_05]: They should be regulating the multi-detectors, honestly.

1905
02:18:12,810 --> 02:18:16,372
[SPEAKER_11]: But in some cases where people smoke in the house, they turn off smoke detectors.

1906
02:18:17,973 --> 02:18:19,494
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, I know, I know.

1907
02:18:20,195 --> 02:18:28,740
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, especially a lot of the manufacturing with some of those mobile homes are not always up to standard.

1908
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:32,682
[SPEAKER_11]: It's always very important that they be checked out, you know.

1909
02:18:33,483 --> 02:18:40,627
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, my brother's girlfriend, she was 18, and her mom was in her 50s.

1910
02:18:41,468 --> 02:18:44,410
[SPEAKER_11]: And both way too young to, you know...

1911
02:18:45,834 --> 02:18:46,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's very unfortunate.

1912
02:18:47,035 --> 02:18:47,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry to hear it.

1913
02:18:48,296 --> 02:18:54,660
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and my brother Matthew, he was a bit of a mess when I talked to him, but he seems to be doing better.

1914
02:18:54,980 --> 02:18:57,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, I would be too, so I can't blame him.

1915
02:18:58,002 --> 02:19:01,105
[SPEAKER_05]: So let that tragedy be awareness for everybody.

1916
02:19:01,165 --> 02:19:01,945
[SPEAKER_05]: It's no joke.

1917
02:19:02,185 --> 02:19:06,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like, you know, unfortunately I had a tragedy where I lost someone to H1N1 last year.

1918
02:19:06,748 --> 02:19:07,369
[SPEAKER_05]: It's no joke.

1919
02:19:07,429 --> 02:19:08,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of these things you hear about, no joke.

1920
02:19:09,410 --> 02:19:11,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Loki, your FU's of the week.

1921
02:19:12,552 --> 02:19:14,814
[SPEAKER_05]: We're in need of dick and fart joke to kind of help things out here.

1922
02:19:15,534 --> 02:19:16,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Just relieve the tension.

1923
02:19:18,716 --> 02:19:21,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this guy was a dick.

1924
02:19:23,019 --> 02:19:26,461
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have anything, no way of working a fart, I guess.

1925
02:19:27,082 --> 02:19:29,443
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess you can make a fart sound when you call him, though.

1926
02:19:30,144 --> 02:19:30,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh...

1927
02:19:32,285 --> 02:19:36,090
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the guy last week that stole my Xbox 360 or whatever.

1928
02:19:36,190 --> 02:19:41,696
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, yeah, I'll try to get a hold of him, see if everything works out, blah, blah, blah.

1929
02:19:41,816 --> 02:19:44,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, he wasn't expecting to hear from him and never did.

1930
02:19:44,840 --> 02:19:47,122
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you may be able to hear from him instead.

1931
02:19:47,563 --> 02:19:50,526
[SPEAKER_03]: So, here's his phone number if you want to give him a call, shoot him a text.

1932
02:19:51,287 --> 02:19:52,408
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1933
02:20:07,137 --> 02:20:26,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, phone number is area code 209-981-7595 Or you can email him at ixtremejf at gmail.com That's I-X-T-R-E-M-E-J-F at gmail.com What was that number again?

1934
02:20:27,256 --> 02:20:31,760
[SPEAKER_03]: That number, once again, was 209-981-7595.

1935
02:20:32,221 --> 02:20:37,085
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also in my Twitter if you have questions.

1936
02:20:37,685 --> 02:20:39,687
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be happy to repost it in the chat as well.

1937
02:20:40,428 --> 02:20:42,530
[SPEAKER_03]: And feel free to give him a text.

1938
02:20:42,970 --> 02:20:43,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell him what kind of a douchebag he is.

1939
02:20:43,971 --> 02:20:44,792
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing that right now.

1940
02:20:46,313 --> 02:20:48,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Brad from PodCulture says we should call him on the show.

1941
02:20:48,916 --> 02:20:50,037
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really know.

1942
02:20:50,097 --> 02:20:50,677
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to happen.

1943
02:20:51,758 --> 02:20:52,278
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter.

1944
02:20:52,298 --> 02:20:56,822
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how I feel about Loki doing that anyway, but I understand he's pissed, so whatever.

1945
02:20:58,142 --> 02:20:58,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki speaks for Loki.

1946
02:20:58,923 --> 02:20:59,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

1947
02:20:59,583 --> 02:21:02,425
[SPEAKER_03]: I already contacted the police.

1948
02:21:02,525 --> 02:21:03,846
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't think anything's going to happen.

1949
02:21:04,167 --> 02:21:04,727
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad you did.

1950
02:21:05,848 --> 02:21:08,369
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, even though they have a phone number, it's hard.

1951
02:21:08,470 --> 02:21:09,430
[SPEAKER_03]: It probably got changed.

1952
02:21:10,571 --> 02:21:12,412
[SPEAKER_03]: He could very well just get rid of the phone number.

1953
02:21:13,593 --> 02:21:15,194
[SPEAKER_05]: The iPhone was probably stolen anyway.

1954
02:21:15,574 --> 02:21:16,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1955
02:21:16,575 --> 02:21:17,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly.

1956
02:21:17,716 --> 02:21:18,036
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1957
02:21:18,677 --> 02:21:19,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, bummer.

1958
02:21:21,230 --> 02:21:23,752
[SPEAKER_03]: At the very least, though, I still get JTAG's system.

1959
02:21:23,772 --> 02:21:27,975
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one coming off of eBay, legit, and will be here this week.

1960
02:21:28,155 --> 02:21:29,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm glad your story hasn't happened yet.

1961
02:21:29,316 --> 02:21:30,016
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep, invalid number.

1962
02:21:30,557 --> 02:21:30,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1963
02:21:31,738 --> 02:21:32,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Changed the number.

1964
02:21:33,855 --> 02:21:34,156
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1965
02:21:34,516 --> 02:21:35,376
[SPEAKER_05]: And probably change the email, too.

1966
02:21:36,457 --> 02:21:36,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1967
02:21:37,017 --> 02:21:37,837
[SPEAKER_05]: MyFU.

1968
02:21:37,877 --> 02:21:41,459
[SPEAKER_05]: You should look for other similar sounding things in Stockton, though.

1969
02:21:41,479 --> 02:21:43,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Like search Craigslist for a similar ad.

1970
02:21:43,840 --> 02:21:44,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, good.

1971
02:21:44,741 --> 02:21:45,001
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1972
02:21:46,001 --> 02:21:46,522
[SPEAKER_05]: MyFU.

1973
02:21:46,542 --> 02:21:47,322
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll try to keep it brief.

1974
02:21:47,682 --> 02:21:50,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had to make a very tough decision over the weekend.

1975
02:21:50,524 --> 02:21:55,086
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, like with any decision, you have those two guys that sit on your shoulder.

1976
02:21:55,126 --> 02:22:01,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Not necessarily the angel and the devil, but the, you know, advocate for one side and the advocate for the other that yell and argue back and forth.

1977
02:22:01,929 --> 02:22:10,393
[SPEAKER_05]: So although I'm fairly confident in this decision I'm about to make, I say F you to the guy that sits on my shoulder saying, Are you sure?

1978
02:22:12,014 --> 02:22:13,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you sure?

1979
02:22:13,795 --> 02:22:15,836
[SPEAKER_09]: We could get you a big Uzi to shoot him with.

1980
02:22:16,336 --> 02:22:17,617
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I would shoot myself.

1981
02:22:17,737 --> 02:22:19,138
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how I feel about guns.

1982
02:22:19,178 --> 02:22:21,559
[SPEAKER_03]: You're saying an F you to the granny questions?

1983
02:22:22,299 --> 02:22:22,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

1984
02:22:23,140 --> 02:22:23,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you wish to save?

1985
02:22:24,140 --> 02:22:25,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you sure?

1986
02:22:28,150 --> 02:22:29,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

1987
02:22:46,824 --> 02:22:50,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Activision and Fendi Ward are asking you, do you suffer from mapathy?

1988
02:22:51,448 --> 02:22:55,511
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, they're planning on releasing the first map pack for Modern Warfare 2.

1989
02:22:56,412 --> 02:22:59,154
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be coming to Xbox Live on March 30th.

1990
02:22:59,735 --> 02:23:06,060
[SPEAKER_03]: No word yet when PlayStation 3 will be getting it, but apparently it's going to be a timed exclusive type of thing.

1991
02:23:06,960 --> 02:23:08,741
[SPEAKER_03]: What will the map pack include?

1992
02:23:09,201 --> 02:23:13,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it will include a couple new maps.

1993
02:23:13,283 --> 02:23:19,687
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess two of them are Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare 1 remakes.

1994
02:23:21,107 --> 02:23:29,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, apparently, there's going to be some other ones including Bailout, which is a multi-level apartment complex.

1995
02:23:29,552 --> 02:23:30,172
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds kind of cool.

1996
02:23:31,693 --> 02:23:35,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Storm, an open industrial park littered with heavy machinery.

1997
02:23:36,016 --> 02:23:41,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Salvage, a snowy junkyard fortified with stacked debris and crushed cars.

1998
02:23:43,081 --> 02:23:53,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Two of the maps that are getting remade from Call of Duty 4 include Crash, which is a war-torn urban environment, and Overgrown, which is a massive dry creek bed.

1999
02:23:56,351 --> 02:23:56,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of neat.

2000
02:24:00,163 --> 02:24:00,483
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2001
02:24:01,463 --> 02:24:03,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of fun Modern Warfare developments there.

2002
02:24:04,624 --> 02:24:08,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, none of those map packs pay the heads of Infinity Ward.

2003
02:24:08,745 --> 02:24:13,986
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, was the content designed before the heads of Infinity Ward were axed?

2004
02:24:14,026 --> 02:24:14,786
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm assuming they were.

2005
02:24:14,806 --> 02:24:15,646
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's kind of funny.

2006
02:24:15,686 --> 02:24:23,168
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to love, though, the name of the download content is the stimulus package.

2007
02:24:24,468 --> 02:24:26,749
[SPEAKER_03]: If that's not a slap in the face, I don't know what is.

2008
02:24:28,226 --> 02:24:28,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, did you?

2009
02:24:28,746 --> 02:24:31,847
[SPEAKER_03]: And they should have called it Infinity Ward, you know.

2010
02:24:32,567 --> 02:24:36,449
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't realize this because I don't really play games like Modern Warfare.

2011
02:24:36,469 --> 02:24:37,389
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, not that they're bad.

2012
02:24:37,429 --> 02:24:38,929
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just games I don't really play.

2013
02:24:39,509 --> 02:24:45,591
[SPEAKER_05]: I had heard that the credits in that game are kind of funny because like all the studio credits, you know, they scroll by or whatever.

2014
02:24:45,611 --> 02:24:49,853
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when it gets to the credits for Activision, it speeds up and they run by like eight times as fast.

2015
02:24:49,913 --> 02:24:51,173
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it goes back to normal.

2016
02:24:51,913 --> 02:24:56,096
[SPEAKER_05]: There's always that tongue-in-cheek, we don't like Activision thing going on in those games.

2017
02:24:56,737 --> 02:24:58,118
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard that on another show.

2018
02:24:58,158 --> 02:24:58,858
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was funny.

2019
02:24:59,619 --> 02:24:59,879
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2020
02:25:00,819 --> 02:25:03,341
[SPEAKER_05]: How about some news on Monkey Island?

2021
02:25:03,621 --> 02:25:09,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Monkey Island is coming to PSN, Mac, Telltale, and Instant Action, I guess.

2022
02:25:09,625 --> 02:25:09,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

2023
02:25:11,066 --> 02:25:14,709
[SPEAKER_05]: The game store, of course, instantaction.com would be the other thing we're talking about there.

2024
02:25:15,349 --> 02:25:16,851
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2025
02:25:40,404 --> 02:25:44,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there it is, The Secret of Monkey Island 2 coming out this summer on all those systems.

2026
02:25:44,731 --> 02:25:48,117
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not quite the special edition, just so you know.

2027
02:25:48,477 --> 02:25:51,262
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just some new controls on the classic game.

2028
02:25:51,342 --> 02:25:54,186
[SPEAKER_05]: But still, what a good game.

2029
02:25:56,889 --> 02:25:57,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

2030
02:25:58,091 --> 02:25:59,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I guess that's it for now.

2031
02:26:00,594 --> 02:26:02,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Should we try to open up the Skype line and take some calls?

2032
02:26:03,097 --> 02:26:06,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, open it wide up.

2033
02:26:06,321 --> 02:26:09,505
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2034
02:26:09,545 --> 02:26:11,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Skype line is open for business.

2035
02:26:12,628 --> 02:26:17,310
[SPEAKER_05]: While we wait for some calls, because it takes about a minute for the chatters to get the message, Loki, do you have any last-minute stories for us?

2036
02:26:17,510 --> 02:26:18,871
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, DarkSakura, do you have anything?

2037
02:26:19,131 --> 02:26:19,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-uh.

2038
02:26:20,171 --> 02:26:20,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, then Loki?

2039
02:26:22,732 --> 02:26:29,495
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure I do, and I'm just trying to navigate myself towards the webpage where said stories would be.

2040
02:26:30,595 --> 02:26:31,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see here.

2041
02:26:32,136 --> 02:26:34,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about Guitar Freaks XG.

2042
02:26:34,617 --> 02:26:36,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, it's been released.

2043
02:26:36,598 --> 02:26:39,339
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming in Japan, because I sure as hell haven't seen one over here.

2044
02:26:39,619 --> 02:26:41,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Then again, I haven't been in Arcaden forever.

2045
02:26:42,080 --> 02:27:08,608
[SPEAKER_03]: but um yes Guitar Freak Show Mania XG has been released um in Japan and of course you may remember XG is the one where they have the extra buttons on the guitar and then the drums are a little bit fancier and whatnot but um but is the game fun I don't know well let's go to the phones hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this hi this is Actdeft hi Actdeft what's on your mind our friendly neighborhood Mexican how are you

2046
02:27:09,833 --> 02:27:10,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty fine.

2047
02:27:11,353 --> 02:27:14,635
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to ask a quick question about the PS3.

2048
02:27:14,835 --> 02:27:15,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2049
02:27:17,075 --> 02:27:18,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe Loki can answer this.

2050
02:27:19,396 --> 02:27:25,678
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been hearing and reading in forums that there are PS3 shortages

2051
02:27:28,060 --> 02:27:30,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's rumors going around that I've been hearing.

2052
02:27:32,143 --> 02:27:37,786
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically they're trying to sandbag their numbers for the next financial year.

2053
02:27:39,026 --> 02:27:42,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Because even right now, God of War 3, there were shortage problems.

2054
02:27:42,148 --> 02:27:46,030
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's also rumors that there's a disk pressing problem for God of War 3.

2055
02:27:47,351 --> 02:27:49,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know we got shorted pretty bad.

2056
02:27:50,833 --> 02:27:52,434
[SPEAKER_03]: As well as everyone else did, apparently.

2057
02:27:52,574 --> 02:27:52,754
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

2058
02:27:54,355 --> 02:28:00,043
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been anything first party Sony's been hard to get for like the whole year so far.

2059
02:28:00,644 --> 02:28:09,777
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's supposed to be a lot better in April when their new financial year starts so that they're basically trying to suck as much sales as they can to next year to make it look better.

2060
02:28:10,097 --> 02:28:27,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me jump in for a minute here because, yeah, just to support what you're saying, I got a text message when PS3 Mageddon was going on, and it was one of my friends who, I guess, booted up her PS3, and it was right when the issue happened, so nobody knew that there was a time and date issue going on, and she thought the thing was broken.

2061
02:28:27,770 --> 02:28:37,757
[SPEAKER_05]: So she went to Best Buy and text messaged me and said, Dude, you might want to know for your show, Best Buy has no PlayStation 3s in stock, and their computer has one in the nation located in a store.

2062
02:28:38,317 --> 02:28:39,779
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was related to the apocalypse episode.

2063
02:28:55,036 --> 02:28:57,839
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that happened on February 28th.

2064
02:29:17,600 --> 02:29:18,541
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2065
02:29:35,226 --> 02:29:35,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit!

2066
02:29:37,387 --> 02:29:38,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can always return it, I guess.

2067
02:29:38,748 --> 02:29:50,435
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess so, but some stores take a fee for that and stuff, so it's maybe a blessing in disguise that there were hardly any PS3s on shelves to get, so people couldn't have that knee-jerk reaction of, oh, I'll just get a new PS3.

2068
02:29:51,396 --> 02:29:51,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably.

2069
02:29:52,176 --> 02:29:55,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank gosh, or else Sony might have been in some bigger doo-doo than they were.

2070
02:29:55,638 --> 02:29:58,580
[SPEAKER_05]: But you notice how most people already forgot that that happened.

2071
02:29:58,720 --> 02:29:59,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Already passed it.

2072
02:29:59,801 --> 02:30:00,301
[SPEAKER_05]: We've moved on.

2073
02:30:02,372 --> 02:30:02,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

2074
02:30:03,353 --> 02:30:07,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Bob Coffee in our chatroom, chat.orange.com, piping in, Walmart hasn't gotten any in a while either.

2075
02:30:08,056 --> 02:30:10,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Giovedeo says, my Target's been out for three weeks.

2076
02:30:10,278 --> 02:30:12,740
[SPEAKER_05]: So definitely not just a Best Buy thing.

2077
02:30:12,780 --> 02:30:14,901
[SPEAKER_05]: It does sound like there is some truth to this rumor.

2078
02:30:14,961 --> 02:30:21,706
[SPEAKER_03]: But you watch, if all of a sudden in April they start having tons of them everywhere, that's why, because they were sandbagging them.

2079
02:30:22,455 --> 02:30:22,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy XIII

2080
02:30:47,855 --> 02:30:49,916
[SPEAKER_08]: and God of War coming out next week.

2081
02:30:49,956 --> 02:31:00,738
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know why... Oh, you already explained it, but I would expect them to at least put a little more of the consoles out there in the market.

2082
02:31:00,958 --> 02:31:08,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep in mind though, Actdeft, Sony lost a lot of oomph and people running out to buy a PS3 for Final Fantasy XIII when it jumped ship to 360 as well.

2083
02:31:09,080 --> 02:31:15,681
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I've mentioned earlier in the night, I think it was over on Bobby's show, but there really is no reason to run out and buy a PS3

2084
02:31:16,241 --> 02:31:19,862
[SPEAKER_05]: If you already have a 360 for Final Fantasy XIII, just get it on the 360.

2085
02:31:19,902 --> 02:31:23,043
[SPEAKER_05]: The differences are not major enough to necessitate the change.

2086
02:31:23,483 --> 02:31:26,764
[SPEAKER_05]: But God of War 3, now you can't get that anywhere else.

2087
02:31:26,864 --> 02:31:28,384
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, I think you make a good point.

2088
02:31:28,464 --> 02:31:34,606
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems really strange that Sony would not want God of War 3 to be moving because that's a system seller for some people.

2089
02:31:34,666 --> 02:31:35,126
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is.

2090
02:31:36,806 --> 02:31:39,107
[SPEAKER_03]: They just figured that they're going to sell those copies.

2091
02:31:39,187 --> 02:31:41,788
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just if they don't sell them right now, it's no big deal.

2092
02:31:42,668 --> 02:31:42,908
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

2093
02:31:44,489 --> 02:31:45,389
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see, I mean.

2094
02:31:46,029 --> 02:31:49,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Actdeft, we've got to let you go so we can get more calls, but do you have any other thoughts for us tonight?

2095
02:31:50,911 --> 02:31:51,812
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not really.

2096
02:31:52,312 --> 02:31:53,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Just that question right now.

2097
02:31:53,953 --> 02:31:55,373
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, you have a good one.

2098
02:31:56,194 --> 02:31:56,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care, buddy.

2099
02:31:58,402 --> 02:31:58,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Adios!

2100
02:32:23,433 --> 02:32:24,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you Googling it?

2101
02:32:24,254 --> 02:32:24,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I am.

2102
02:32:24,814 --> 02:32:26,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well, hold on to that.

2103
02:32:26,836 --> 02:32:29,078
[SPEAKER_05]: And if Aki Ripper calls, I don't even know if he's listening.

2104
02:32:29,438 --> 02:32:32,620
[SPEAKER_05]: If he calls tonight, I will have you be our unofficial ambassador.

2105
02:32:32,740 --> 02:32:33,861
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't read any of this.

2106
02:32:34,482 --> 02:32:35,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2107
02:32:35,563 --> 02:32:35,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2108
02:32:37,364 --> 02:32:38,725
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, this is Spazinator.

2109
02:32:38,825 --> 02:32:40,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Spazinator, what's on your mind?

2110
02:32:42,468 --> 02:32:43,149
[SPEAKER_12]: Not much.

2111
02:32:43,289 --> 02:32:46,732
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I was just going to comment on...

2112
02:32:47,799 --> 02:32:59,569
[SPEAKER_12]: What Loki was seeing like five, ten minutes ago, and again last week, about the issue that he's been having with his one system, and that one jerk-off that kind of screwed him over.

2113
02:33:01,590 --> 02:33:03,552
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah?

2114
02:33:04,253 --> 02:33:07,916
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you know, I tried calling the number the other day.

2115
02:33:07,936 --> 02:33:11,959
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, at least the other day, the number was working.

2116
02:33:12,900 --> 02:33:13,060
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

2117
02:33:14,325 --> 02:33:21,571
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, if he doesn't mind, I would like to give a little constructive criticism if I may.

2118
02:33:21,591 --> 02:33:22,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, hold on, hold on.

2119
02:33:23,112 --> 02:33:25,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, are you willing to accept some constructive criticism?

2120
02:33:25,434 --> 02:33:26,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sure, why not?

2121
02:33:26,175 --> 02:33:27,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, then go ahead.

2122
02:33:27,796 --> 02:33:38,164
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I know this is going to sound somewhat harsh, but I could have seen this coming a mile away for a couple reasons.

2123
02:33:40,714 --> 02:33:46,223
[SPEAKER_12]: Did I put Leslie on Craigslist, which is practically the ghetto of the internet.

2124
02:33:46,544 --> 02:33:49,949
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, you hear reports going on.

2125
02:33:50,854 --> 02:33:54,637
[SPEAKER_12]: and other news about Craigslist practically every other day.

2126
02:34:15,190 --> 02:34:40,759
[SPEAKER_03]: basically because and you know really looking at it now I could probably just done a JTAG install myself but the thing is I wanted to install the Cyclo the Cyclo the Cygnus 2 mod chip in there and that's a lot more difficult to install versus you know the just a JTAG JTAG I mean shit I could I could do that I mean that's it's like seven solder points and that's it and they're big and

2127
02:34:41,319 --> 02:34:42,721
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2128
02:35:00,216 --> 02:35:14,148
[SPEAKER_03]: And really, it wouldn't have been a big deal to go to this thing What I should have done is gone Should have just not left the console Should have just gone with the console Did he try to talk you into it?

2129
02:35:14,248 --> 02:35:23,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, okay buddy, just come back in a couple hours and I'll have your console all done Well, it wasn't even that, it was like 30 minutes I was gonna go eat Whose idea was it to leave?

2130
02:35:23,957 --> 02:35:24,197
[SPEAKER_03]: His.

2131
02:35:25,898 --> 02:35:32,681
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I could see that word that would be something, you know, where... Yeah, when you're in the... I mean... Yeah, I understand.

2132
02:35:32,701 --> 02:35:34,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Hindsight is 20-20.

2133
02:35:34,262 --> 02:35:37,363
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you're in the moment and you're like, okay, I kind of trust this guy.

2134
02:35:37,403 --> 02:35:38,184
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got his phone.

2135
02:35:38,204 --> 02:35:38,624
[SPEAKER_03]: He seems cool.

2136
02:35:38,644 --> 02:35:40,845
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought stuff from Craigslist before and it's been fine.

2137
02:35:40,885 --> 02:35:44,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and to be fair, although I'm joking about it being, you know, the bowels of the internet, I...

2138
02:35:45,988 --> 02:35:49,311
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen job postings and stuff work on Craigslist.

2139
02:35:49,471 --> 02:35:54,156
[SPEAKER_05]: My company's posted availabilities on Craigslist, so there are useful purposes for it.

2140
02:35:54,217 --> 02:36:01,124
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if as far as it goes with services and stuff like that, you just have to be careful.

2141
02:36:01,144 --> 02:36:02,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially with adult services.

2142
02:36:03,306 --> 02:36:11,891
[SPEAKER_05]: For the love of God, if you're going to seek adult services on Craigslist, you not only need to use three methods of protection all at once.

2143
02:36:12,091 --> 02:36:16,554
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's assuming that it is actually somebody and not just a police sting operation.

2144
02:36:16,574 --> 02:36:18,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and then you're going to want to bathe in bleach, honestly.

2145
02:36:19,756 --> 02:36:23,579
[SPEAKER_03]: But seriously, it's just some stupid things.

2146
02:36:23,659 --> 02:36:35,749
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you need to do, obviously, if you're getting some services done online, where you're going to get something taken from... A legitimate person would give you some sort of receipt.

2147
02:36:35,789 --> 02:36:37,630
[SPEAKER_03]: You would have an address.

2148
02:36:37,650 --> 02:36:40,893
[SPEAKER_03]: You wouldn't go to an address and he'd be waiting outside of...

2149
02:36:42,294 --> 02:36:43,554
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of red flags.

2150
02:36:43,575 --> 02:36:47,698
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, the address that he gave me was an apartment complex.

2151
02:36:48,738 --> 02:36:49,999
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a house.

2152
02:36:50,199 --> 02:36:51,020
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was a house.

2153
02:36:51,480 --> 02:36:53,041
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, okay, I got his address.

2154
02:36:53,242 --> 02:36:54,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's he going to go?

2155
02:36:54,342 --> 02:36:54,743
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a house.

2156
02:36:55,943 --> 02:36:57,164
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, it was an apartment complex.

2157
02:36:57,425 --> 02:37:00,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Where his friend probably lived.

2158
02:37:01,127 --> 02:37:02,288
[SPEAKER_05]: He has this down to his science.

2159
02:37:02,348 --> 02:37:03,649
[SPEAKER_05]: He ripped you off, he'll rip someone else off.

2160
02:37:03,929 --> 02:37:05,430
[SPEAKER_05]: My question is, what's he doing with all these 360s?

2161
02:37:07,311 --> 02:37:07,791
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2162
02:37:07,951 --> 02:37:08,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably selling them.

2163
02:37:08,892 --> 02:37:09,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Drugs, who knows.

2164
02:37:10,212 --> 02:37:11,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Spazinator, I'm sorry.

2165
02:37:11,072 --> 02:37:12,192
[SPEAKER_12]: Go ahead.

2166
02:37:12,533 --> 02:37:14,293
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I was about to say the same thing.

2167
02:37:15,033 --> 02:37:29,357
[SPEAKER_12]: For at least 10 to 15 years now, throughout the country, not just my area or even just your area, consoles, especially when they're still at the $250 to $300 range, are really, really big with thieves.

2168
02:37:34,676 --> 02:37:41,647
[SPEAKER_12]: They take those $250 to $300 Dell consoles, deal them, turn around a fellow for $50 to $100, or just trade them straight out for...

2169
02:37:48,976 --> 02:37:52,178
[SPEAKER_12]: Drugs, whatever their drug of choice happens to be.

2170
02:37:52,278 --> 02:37:53,818
[SPEAKER_12]: And you never know.

2171
02:37:54,058 --> 02:38:08,986
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a bummer with, since Xbox has the ability to lock out your console when you do something naughty on Xbox Live, it's kind of a pity they don't have a type of service where you could call in and find out where your 360 is or who's connecting to the internet.

2172
02:38:09,286 --> 02:38:14,348
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, granted, they don't want to help people like Loki, but some people get their 360s legitimately stolen out of their home.

2173
02:38:14,368 --> 02:38:17,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I remember Spazinator, weren't you the guy that had your PS3 taken right out of your house?

2174
02:38:19,670 --> 02:38:41,747
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and oddly enough, back in 2003, literally just as the calendar switched over from July to August, two guys barged into my apartment building and had stolen my PlayStation 2.

2175
02:38:43,949 --> 02:38:48,773
[SPEAKER_12]: I called the police immediately, but unfortunately

2176
02:38:49,725 --> 02:38:53,486
[SPEAKER_12]: It's hard to track, too, because there's not, like, unique license plates or whatever.

2177
02:38:53,506 --> 02:38:54,206
[SPEAKER_12]: But there is.

2178
02:38:54,266 --> 02:38:55,207
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a serial number.

2179
02:38:55,747 --> 02:38:57,447
[SPEAKER_12]: I have the serial number.

2180
02:38:57,867 --> 02:38:59,588
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a bummer you can't track?

2181
02:39:12,291 --> 02:39:14,413
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a bummer Xbox doesn't have a service.

2182
02:39:14,453 --> 02:39:19,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Punch in serial number and something to verify it to tells you where it's at.

2183
02:39:19,458 --> 02:39:25,163
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy knew what he was doing as far as JTAGing stuff because he knew what he was talking about.

2184
02:39:25,463 --> 02:39:30,427
[SPEAKER_05]: He probably not only runs the service, he probably mods your stolen 360 and then sells it.

2185
02:39:30,567 --> 02:39:33,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's the thing, and I don't really have a problem that the 360 was stolen.

2186
02:39:34,070 --> 02:39:36,973
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a problem that I waited four hours in Stockton.

2187
02:39:37,293 --> 02:39:39,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't waste my time if you're going to steal from me.

2188
02:39:39,995 --> 02:39:41,956
[SPEAKER_03]: You should have at least had the decency to just mug me.

2189
02:39:42,276 --> 02:39:52,523
[SPEAKER_03]: No, seriously, if he was going to steal my system, just don't respond back to any of my phone calls at all instead of dragging it on for four fucking hours because that was really the issue.

2190
02:39:52,723 --> 02:39:54,124
[SPEAKER_03]: I have 360 consoles.

2191
02:39:54,284 --> 02:39:56,585
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really give a crap if one of them goes away.

2192
02:39:57,246 --> 02:40:02,369
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just an inconvenience for me to sit there for four fucking hours in a car waiting for somebody.

2193
02:40:02,789 --> 02:40:22,172
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta wrap up here and let Spaznate get his final thoughts because we gotta get some more calls but I do want to read this comment from chat because it's funny Brad from PodCulture says this is why my apartment is protected by the sword of omens no shit I have a replica here in the studio that's a weenie we need a sword in the OLR studio okay maybe not DarkSakura might have a gun but she knows not to tell me seriously I have knives

2194
02:40:22,913 --> 02:40:25,855
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had all my airsoft guns stolen.

2195
02:40:25,875 --> 02:40:27,515
[SPEAKER_03]: That was worth way more than this stupid 360.

2196
02:40:28,476 --> 02:40:29,937
[SPEAKER_03]: I just let it roll right off me.

2197
02:40:30,877 --> 02:40:32,718
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a 360, whatever.

2198
02:40:32,878 --> 02:40:34,039
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be screaming.

2199
02:40:34,259 --> 02:40:35,580
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got four more there broken.

2200
02:40:35,700 --> 02:40:37,721
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got to let Spazinator wrap up because we've got to get more calls.

2201
02:40:37,761 --> 02:40:40,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Spazinator, thank you for the lively discussion and inspiration.

2202
02:40:40,402 --> 02:40:42,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2203
02:40:44,404 --> 02:40:45,425
[SPEAKER_12]: Nothing comes to mind.

2204
02:40:45,745 --> 02:40:48,426
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll take five seconds or less.

2205
02:40:49,547 --> 02:40:50,908
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll talk to Loki...

2206
02:40:51,804 --> 02:40:58,588
[SPEAKER_12]: about this issue later on throughout the weekend on live or on Twitter or whatever.

2207
02:40:59,329 --> 02:41:01,050
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll talk to you guys later.

2208
02:41:01,090 --> 02:41:01,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Just be careful.

2209
02:41:01,770 --> 02:41:03,891
[SPEAKER_05]: He might mess with you like he was messing with Cheeseburger.

2210
02:41:03,971 --> 02:41:05,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that was just earlier.

2211
02:41:05,612 --> 02:41:07,494
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe he got so confused by it.

2212
02:41:07,554 --> 02:41:09,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just like, he must have been confused with the other Loki.

2213
02:41:10,055 --> 02:41:11,096
[SPEAKER_03]: You're so rude, Loki.

2214
02:41:11,116 --> 02:41:11,376
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2215
02:41:11,676 --> 02:41:12,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care, Spazinator.

2216
02:41:12,537 --> 02:41:13,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for the call.

2217
02:41:13,297 --> 02:41:13,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one.

2218
02:41:14,398 --> 02:41:14,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

2219
02:41:15,034 --> 02:41:35,427
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta ask Spazinator if he's watching the tester because he's a big Sony fan I mean usually he'll call in although I don't know about anymore because I know he's been having his issue with Sony's lately but I gotta ask him if he's been watching that because it seems like as a Sony fan maybe that's something he's into I don't know I can't believe I'm admitting I've actually been watching the tester

2220
02:41:36,207 --> 02:41:37,128
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not terrible.

2221
02:41:38,670 --> 02:41:41,894
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to file it under the Tron and Showgirls category.

2222
02:41:42,095 --> 02:41:44,618
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so bad it's kind of good.

2223
02:41:44,678 --> 02:41:45,459
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't explain it.

2224
02:41:45,859 --> 02:41:51,386
[SPEAKER_03]: And seriously, the whole reason I put the guy's phone number in email, because I know that the police aren't going to do anything.

2225
02:41:51,406 --> 02:41:53,830
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to be able to do anything because they don't have a name.

2226
02:41:53,870 --> 02:41:54,991
[SPEAKER_03]: This is martial law.

2227
02:41:54,991 --> 02:41:56,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Amiga 777, what is on your mind my friend?

2228
02:42:20,734 --> 02:42:28,042
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'd just like to send a public apology to some of the listeners from Japan that might have been listening last week.

2229
02:42:28,762 --> 02:42:35,269
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess about some of the things that I said about, you know, the whole PlayStation 2 birthday tenure thing.

2230
02:42:35,570 --> 02:42:35,790
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?

2231
02:42:38,419 --> 02:42:42,082
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, actually, you know, PS2 is alright.

2232
02:42:45,304 --> 02:42:51,348
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things, you know, kind of going back to that question, you're like, what could the Dreamcast have done better?

2233
02:42:52,648 --> 02:42:53,129
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh...

2234
02:42:54,147 --> 02:43:08,273
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back on that, well, I could probably enter that question maybe toward in, let's see, October, which is technically the month that the PS2 came out here in the U.S.,

2235
02:43:13,668 --> 02:43:19,233
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, Amiga, I remember your call and I don't think you have to go out of your way to apologize.

2236
02:43:19,293 --> 02:43:20,935
[SPEAKER_05]: It was your own opinion and what have you.

2237
02:43:21,515 --> 02:43:23,076
[SPEAKER_05]: And last week was a little bit crazy anyway.

2238
02:43:23,537 --> 02:43:35,107
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I think you kind of bring up a point though that certainly the PlayStation 2 saw levels of success in other countries that may not have even been, you know, kind of duplicated here or what have you.

2239
02:43:35,939 --> 02:43:37,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.

2240
02:43:38,160 --> 02:43:41,082
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just one thing that was on my mind.

2241
02:43:41,402 --> 02:43:43,283
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, you know what?

2242
02:43:43,603 --> 02:43:47,646
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes a real man to man up to an apology, although I don't think you needed to apologize.

2243
02:43:47,686 --> 02:43:49,767
[SPEAKER_05]: You had a perfectly fine opinion, but that's fine.

2244
02:43:49,907 --> 02:43:51,328
[SPEAKER_05]: You said your piece.

2245
02:43:51,608 --> 02:43:54,149
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think, can't we all just get along?

2246
02:43:54,310 --> 02:43:58,632
[SPEAKER_05]: There's room in retro gaming love for PS2 and Dreamcast, and plenty of it.

2247
02:44:00,838 --> 02:44:01,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care, Amiga.

2248
02:44:01,639 --> 02:44:02,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one.

2249
02:44:02,661 --> 02:44:03,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care.

2250
02:44:03,222 --> 02:44:05,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Later.

2251
02:44:05,244 --> 02:44:08,509
[SPEAKER_05]: 877-GAME-OLR is the number to call, but our phones are lighting up.

2252
02:44:08,529 --> 02:44:09,471
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like back-to-back calls.

2253
02:44:09,491 --> 02:44:10,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2254
02:44:10,432 --> 02:44:10,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2255
02:44:11,373 --> 02:44:12,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, this is Brad from PodCulture.

2256
02:44:12,815 --> 02:44:14,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hello, Brad from PodCulture.

2257
02:44:14,558 --> 02:44:15,119
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind?

2258
02:44:16,492 --> 02:44:20,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Loki, you are far more laid back than I ever would be.

2259
02:44:20,096 --> 02:44:20,576
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

2260
02:44:21,036 --> 02:44:24,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Just based on your Twitter and some of the problems, I won't get into it because it's on your Twitter.

2261
02:44:24,780 --> 02:44:33,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the recent problems you've been having with a certain realty company you've been dealing with, you do not strike me as the type that would be as passive as Loki.

2262
02:44:34,248 --> 02:44:34,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm red-headed.

2263
02:44:34,949 --> 02:44:36,251
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the temperament to go with it.

2264
02:44:36,331 --> 02:44:37,072
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.

2265
02:44:37,192 --> 02:44:37,812
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.

2266
02:44:38,033 --> 02:44:40,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's just not much I can do with the information I have and stuff.

2267
02:44:41,036 --> 02:44:44,279
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like I can go to the guy's house and demand justice.

2268
02:44:44,620 --> 02:44:45,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me back my son!

2269
02:44:45,541 --> 02:44:50,026
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know where the hell he lives, and I don't know what the hell his name is, because he's used a couple different names.

2270
02:44:50,126 --> 02:44:52,168
[SPEAKER_03]: At this point...

2271
02:44:53,209 --> 02:44:54,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Lesson learned.

2272
02:44:54,290 --> 02:44:56,513
[SPEAKER_05]: You just get smarter, that's all you have to do.

2273
02:44:56,553 --> 02:44:58,254
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to use this as an opportunity.

2274
02:44:58,415 --> 02:45:06,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that we should be encouraging people to mod their consoles anyway, but you had a legitimate, I mean, I think it's legitimate to want to mod your 360 to play Japanese games.

2275
02:45:07,003 --> 02:45:13,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Every week on this show I talk about Japanese release dates, and even just tonight I said, oh, here's a game on the 360, looks interesting, it'll never come out over here.

2276
02:45:13,730 --> 02:45:17,331
[SPEAKER_05]: So people have a legitimate reason to want to mod their 360 to play Japanese games.

2277
02:45:17,651 --> 02:45:21,352
[SPEAKER_05]: But let Loki's pain be a lesson to the rest of you.

2278
02:45:21,832 --> 02:45:23,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Be careful.

2279
02:45:23,273 --> 02:45:24,133
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time to be smart.

2280
02:45:24,233 --> 02:45:25,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Use common sense.

2281
02:45:26,013 --> 02:45:31,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't trust a dude you met on Craigslist with your console ever.

2282
02:45:31,435 --> 02:45:32,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not walk away.

2283
02:45:32,375 --> 02:45:33,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get talked into it.

2284
02:45:33,596 --> 02:45:35,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Just say, no, I'll just hang out here.

2285
02:45:35,896 --> 02:45:37,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I watch you do it or whatever?

2286
02:45:37,597 --> 02:45:38,497
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just kind of...

2287
02:45:39,277 --> 02:45:41,479
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, sit here and watch you from my car.

2288
02:45:41,639 --> 02:45:43,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Be just upfront and honest.

2289
02:45:43,020 --> 02:45:45,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Be like, listen, dude, I just met you.

2290
02:45:45,121 --> 02:45:46,122
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't fucking trust you.

2291
02:45:46,242 --> 02:45:48,243
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I'm going with the console.

2292
02:45:48,584 --> 02:45:50,665
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're either going to do this real quick.

2293
02:45:51,025 --> 02:45:57,910
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing, too, I mean, it's like, seriously, if it's going to take four hours, I want to be there fucking going, hey, listen, are you done?

2294
02:45:58,110 --> 02:45:58,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you done?

2295
02:45:58,690 --> 02:45:59,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you done?

2296
02:45:59,211 --> 02:45:59,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you done?

2297
02:45:59,931 --> 02:46:03,393
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, or like, you know, if it's taking too damn long, listen, I'll just finish the rest at home.

2298
02:46:03,894 --> 02:46:04,414
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because that...

2299
02:46:06,094 --> 02:46:20,914
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just it's absolutely ridiculous to have to wait for four hours and it's just that was the part that pissed me off is the fact that he drug it out for four fucking hours if you're gonna steal a thing just say you just don't reply back or just reply back to the text you know sucker and then that's it

2300
02:46:22,136 --> 02:46:23,397
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, seriously, what are you going to do?

2301
02:46:23,457 --> 02:46:25,338
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you know, I can't track you down.

2302
02:46:25,358 --> 02:46:26,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know where the fuck you live.

2303
02:46:26,559 --> 02:46:30,622
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I wish I did follow him because then I'd know where the fuck he lived.

2304
02:46:30,962 --> 02:46:32,744
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be going right straight to his apartment.

2305
02:46:33,604 --> 02:46:35,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Or probably just wouldn't have gotten anything to eat.

2306
02:46:36,006 --> 02:46:38,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Or one of the listeners would have gone straight to his apartment by now.

2307
02:46:38,988 --> 02:46:39,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably.

2308
02:46:39,849 --> 02:46:40,369
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

2309
02:46:40,949 --> 02:46:45,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, do you have any further advice, I guess, maybe, for Loki?

2310
02:46:46,033 --> 02:46:46,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't use Craigslist?

2311
02:46:46,954 --> 02:46:47,254
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2312
02:46:48,895 --> 02:46:50,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, trust no one.

2313
02:46:52,142 --> 02:46:53,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much.

2314
02:46:53,283 --> 02:46:58,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if you're going to go use someone on Craigslist or whatever like that, just be really crazy about it.

2315
02:46:59,307 --> 02:47:00,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Fingerprint the guy.

2316
02:47:01,889 --> 02:47:03,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Get his picture.

2317
02:47:03,790 --> 02:47:07,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if he takes your 360, take their driver's license or something.

2318
02:47:07,152 --> 02:47:08,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Although that could be fake too.

2319
02:47:08,813 --> 02:47:11,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, most people I don't think would expect that.

2320
02:47:11,475 --> 02:47:11,955
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

2321
02:47:13,116 --> 02:47:19,580
[SPEAKER_02]: The one time I had a console chipped, it was somebody who knew somebody and that was back in the day when the PlayStation 1

2322
02:47:21,378 --> 02:47:21,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, man.

2323
02:47:21,879 --> 02:47:24,082
[SPEAKER_05]: The PlayStation 1 was so easy to mod, though.

2324
02:47:24,863 --> 02:47:27,327
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura bought me a plug.

2325
02:47:27,427 --> 02:47:31,473
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a present for, I don't know, something that I just plugged into the back of the thing.

2326
02:47:31,573 --> 02:47:31,833
[SPEAKER_05]: You did.

2327
02:47:31,874 --> 02:47:32,675
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know if you remember.

2328
02:47:32,695 --> 02:47:33,876
[SPEAKER_05]: I got mine chipped just to play two games.

2329
02:47:33,896 --> 02:47:33,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

2330
02:47:38,823 --> 02:47:53,053
[SPEAKER_05]: you did, that's how we played, remember the one day at my apartment we all came, all the sacramentals came over to play DDR Third Mix that's when I discovered my love for Erotic and Oh Nick Please Not So Quick yeah, the thing, the IOPort thing yeah

2331
02:47:54,034 --> 02:48:00,156
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have the skills to solder, so I had to have someone do it.

2332
02:48:00,176 --> 02:48:02,037
[SPEAKER_03]: I also have another art form I'm looking to get rid of.

2333
02:48:03,117 --> 02:48:11,400
[SPEAKER_11]: We used those for a while, but for the longest time Dan and I didn't need them because we could still disc swap on our PlayStation.

2334
02:48:12,641 --> 02:48:13,401
[SPEAKER_11]: The single swap.

2335
02:48:14,580 --> 02:48:16,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, there was like a trick you could do for it.

2336
02:48:16,821 --> 02:48:19,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, with the first one, it was just the single swap.

2337
02:48:19,501 --> 02:48:26,082
[SPEAKER_11]: It would load the PlayStation screen, and then you stop the spinner by pressing the little button to the thing.

2338
02:48:26,102 --> 02:48:26,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I remember that.

2339
02:48:26,703 --> 02:48:28,023
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and then you move it out.

2340
02:48:28,263 --> 02:48:29,723
[SPEAKER_11]: You used a paper clip to do it.

2341
02:48:29,883 --> 02:48:31,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Crazy, crazy stuff.

2342
02:48:31,104 --> 02:48:34,944
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, Brad, anything else on your mind tonight you wanted to talk about?

2343
02:48:35,464 --> 02:48:42,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, with the, you know, games are expensive and stuff, and I've got the studio in turmoil here because we're packing up to move.

2344
02:48:44,437 --> 02:48:54,007
[SPEAKER_02]: But to save a few bucks and something that not everyone might think about is I've been buying a lot of games used from Gamefly.

2345
02:48:54,047 --> 02:48:57,091
[SPEAKER_02]: I just picked up Brutal Legend, Batman Arkham Asylum, and...

2346
02:48:58,325 --> 02:49:02,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Ghostbusters for less than the price of one game new.

2347
02:49:02,629 --> 02:49:04,250
[SPEAKER_05]: I've actually been using Gamefly now.

2348
02:49:05,031 --> 02:49:07,633
[SPEAKER_05]: I have this really bad habit of hanging on to one game for six months.

2349
02:49:08,694 --> 02:49:14,500
[SPEAKER_05]: They send me emails all the time about, hey, do you just want to buy the game you've had for four months?

2350
02:49:14,900 --> 02:49:15,921
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a bad idea.

2351
02:49:15,941 --> 02:49:18,063
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they give you a little bit of money.

2352
02:49:18,143 --> 02:49:18,523
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like $5, $10.

2353
02:49:19,664 --> 02:49:21,966
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not very significant, but it's enough to try and hook you.

2354
02:49:22,307 --> 02:49:23,227
[SPEAKER_05]: The little fish bait.

2355
02:49:23,327 --> 02:49:24,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Enough to try and hook you.

2356
02:49:25,409 --> 02:49:28,952
[SPEAKER_05]: They're at the top of their game for the service they're providing.

2357
02:49:28,992 --> 02:49:32,594
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a service for everybody, but it's a good service.

2358
02:49:33,655 --> 02:49:34,696
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't use it that often.

2359
02:49:34,776 --> 02:49:36,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like, I'm kind of broke right now.

2360
02:49:37,017 --> 02:49:39,199
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, used games, nothing wrong with that.

2361
02:49:39,259 --> 02:49:46,944
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so many games that came out like a year ago that I didn't have time to play that there's... Less than 20 bucks a pop now.

2362
02:49:47,044 --> 02:49:48,065
[SPEAKER_05]: For real, for real.

2363
02:49:48,606 --> 02:49:53,329
[SPEAKER_05]: So good advice to the gamer in this economy, I suppose.

2364
02:49:53,709 --> 02:49:53,929
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2365
02:49:53,969 --> 02:49:57,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Brad, we got to let you go because our phone lines have been on fire and I want to get at least one more call.

2366
02:49:57,774 --> 02:49:58,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Later, guys.

2367
02:49:58,434 --> 02:49:58,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Later, buddy.

2368
02:49:59,656 --> 02:49:59,896
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2369
02:50:00,337 --> 02:50:03,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, please don't be butthurt if you don't get through our phone call.

2370
02:50:04,762 --> 02:50:08,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, now it's not lit up, but probably because everyone still hears Brad on the phone.

2371
02:50:08,786 --> 02:50:14,968
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to tell you, Rob, I actually went on to the iTunes store because, really, I wanted to buy Final Fantasy II.

2372
02:50:16,929 --> 02:50:18,970
[SPEAKER_11]: And I found reviews for Street Fighter IV.

2373
02:50:19,230 --> 02:50:21,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes, that had come out during GDC, I heard.

2374
02:50:21,271 --> 02:50:27,573
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm probably going to pick it up after payday, just given that out of 567 reviews, it's currently sitting at...

2375
02:50:33,795 --> 02:50:34,175
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me see.

2376
02:50:34,255 --> 02:50:39,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, out of 894 ratings, it's got 668 five-star.

2377
02:50:40,118 --> 02:50:42,139
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's currently at a four-and-a-half star.

2378
02:50:42,439 --> 02:50:42,979
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not bad.

2379
02:50:44,140 --> 02:50:44,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2380
02:50:44,640 --> 02:50:46,721
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't believe, though, the controls are any good.

2381
02:50:46,741 --> 02:50:49,122
[SPEAKER_05]: But we got another call, so I'm going to go to the phones.

2382
02:50:49,642 --> 02:50:50,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio.

2383
02:50:50,603 --> 02:50:50,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2384
02:50:50,963 --> 02:50:52,924
[SPEAKER_05]: It's DT.

2385
02:50:53,244 --> 02:50:55,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I haven't heard from you in a long time.

2386
02:50:55,345 --> 02:50:56,166
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you, DT?

2387
02:50:56,506 --> 02:50:56,966
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

2388
02:50:57,466 --> 02:50:57,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

2389
02:50:58,166 --> 02:50:58,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Good, good.

2390
02:50:58,627 --> 02:50:59,987
[SPEAKER_05]: I took out that shirt, by the way.

2391
02:51:00,908 --> 02:51:01,288
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

2392
02:51:04,409 --> 02:51:12,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, that's like finding your class of 96 shirt in a truck somewhere.

2393
02:51:13,114 --> 02:51:13,854
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

2394
02:51:13,894 --> 02:51:16,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, the first tournament was SCAT, right?

2395
02:51:16,095 --> 02:51:18,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Shaft was second, right?

2396
02:51:18,057 --> 02:51:20,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Sacramento's cosplay and tournament.

2397
02:51:20,898 --> 02:51:27,002
[SPEAKER_05]: For those that don't know, okay, again, let me quickly give the backstory for those that haven't listened to OLR a very long time.

2398
02:51:28,742 --> 02:51:36,504
[SPEAKER_05]: This show was formed because Loki, myself, and DarkSakura, and DT, you were a part of this circle too, would meet up at the arcade and play DDR games.

2399
02:51:36,704 --> 02:51:38,044
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how we all kind of met.

2400
02:51:38,144 --> 02:51:41,065
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, our show started about music-based video games because of that.

2401
02:51:41,405 --> 02:51:47,226
[SPEAKER_05]: But when the Mamani series started kind of tapering off, we branched out to saying, well, hell, we play all video games.

2402
02:51:47,246 --> 02:51:48,106
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't just play DDR.

2403
02:51:48,126 --> 02:51:49,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about all video games.

2404
02:51:49,166 --> 02:51:50,767
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where we've been at for a few years.

2405
02:51:52,867 --> 02:51:59,012
[SPEAKER_05]: But as part of this DDR loving circle, we used to throw tournaments.

2406
02:51:59,312 --> 02:52:05,197
[SPEAKER_05]: And the first one we had was SCAT, Sacramentals, because we're from Sacramento, California, cosplay and tournament.

2407
02:52:05,657 --> 02:52:10,261
[SPEAKER_05]: And we actually encouraged people to dress up, although I think we had maybe four people all day that actually came dressed up.

2408
02:52:10,681 --> 02:52:18,088
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we had a DDR tournament, which actually, for its time, a lot of people... We had a ton of people show up!

2409
02:52:18,208 --> 02:52:21,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Sacramento was kind of the place you went because you just don't give a fuck.

2410
02:52:21,731 --> 02:52:25,895
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a lot of people didn't take our tournament that seriously, and it was okay.

2411
02:52:26,075 --> 02:52:27,076
[SPEAKER_05]: People had fun with it.

2412
02:52:27,156 --> 02:52:29,158
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know me, you know DarkSakura, you know Loki.

2413
02:52:29,398 --> 02:52:30,540
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all about just having fun.

2414
02:52:30,860 --> 02:52:33,082
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Loki, if I remember right... Oh, Loki.

2415
02:52:33,102 --> 02:52:33,883
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to embarrass Loki.

2416
02:52:34,543 --> 02:52:37,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki had a Dynamite Rave routine ready to go.

2417
02:52:37,265 --> 02:52:38,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really.

2418
02:52:38,606 --> 02:52:41,568
[SPEAKER_03]: I had at one point memorized Dynamite Rave backwards.

2419
02:52:41,708 --> 02:52:46,231
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was dressed up like one of the guys from The Matrix because it was that many years ago.

2420
02:52:46,251 --> 02:52:47,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because I had a trench coat on.

2421
02:52:48,232 --> 02:52:49,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's what you look like.

2422
02:52:49,353 --> 02:52:51,194
[SPEAKER_05]: And he started to dance and he fell.

2423
02:52:51,835 --> 02:52:55,097
[SPEAKER_03]: And I forgot what the... But he laughed.

2424
02:52:55,137 --> 02:52:56,598
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't go in the corner and cry.

2425
02:52:57,098 --> 02:52:59,560
[SPEAKER_05]: He laughed and we all laughed at him.

2426
02:52:59,860 --> 02:53:01,061
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we all laughed with him.

2427
02:53:01,681 --> 02:53:01,941
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2428
02:53:02,742 --> 02:53:03,422
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we laughed at him.

2429
02:53:03,502 --> 02:53:04,003
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm just kidding.

2430
02:53:04,783 --> 02:53:05,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, oh, yeah, no, I The best of

2431
02:53:31,775 --> 02:53:36,059
[SPEAKER_05]: The Best of Orange Lounge Radio Well, I'm just waiting on Misty to finish up the narration Yeah, I...

2432
02:53:49,799 --> 02:53:53,302
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2433
02:54:18,599 --> 02:54:19,579
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be a fun show.

2434
02:54:19,659 --> 02:54:23,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Tune in for that night when I'm not here and DarkSakura is running the control board.

2435
02:54:23,340 --> 02:54:24,740
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be a hootin' holla.

2436
02:54:24,820 --> 02:54:24,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi!

2437
02:54:25,080 --> 02:54:28,101
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to have to totally show me the stuff that I'm missing, by the way.

2438
02:54:28,281 --> 02:54:28,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't wait.

2439
02:54:29,602 --> 02:54:30,042
[SPEAKER_05]: It's easy.

2440
02:54:31,242 --> 02:54:33,442
[SPEAKER_05]: This new system is so much easier than our old system.

2441
02:54:33,742 --> 02:54:34,103
[SPEAKER_05]: It's easy.

2442
02:54:35,083 --> 02:54:35,763
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it'll be fun.

2443
02:54:36,383 --> 02:54:37,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else on your mind, DarkSakura, tonight?

2444
02:54:39,364 --> 02:54:43,125
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I've just been playing a lot of 2DX.

2445
02:54:43,205 --> 02:54:43,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, 2DX.

2446
02:54:43,565 --> 02:54:44,905
[SPEAKER_05]: You beat a new song tonight, right?

2447
02:54:46,107 --> 02:54:53,350
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I actually passed V. Well, I got this, I don't know if Loki's heard of it, the ESR, the memory card exploit.

2448
02:54:53,830 --> 02:54:54,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

2449
02:54:55,371 --> 02:54:57,092
[SPEAKER_14]: You can play copies on it.

2450
02:54:58,672 --> 02:54:59,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

2451
02:54:59,613 --> 02:55:01,734
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I beat V, finally.

2452
02:55:02,014 --> 02:55:02,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.

2453
02:55:02,974 --> 02:55:05,075
[SPEAKER_05]: That's quite an accomplishment, so very cool.

2454
02:55:05,395 --> 02:55:07,496
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, DT, I'm going to let you go.

2455
02:55:07,756 --> 02:55:09,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one, buddy, and thanks for calling.

2456
02:55:09,917 --> 02:55:10,117
[SPEAKER_05]: You too.

2457
02:55:10,357 --> 02:55:11,178
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, bye-bye.

2458
02:55:12,940 --> 02:55:18,324
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100Matt actually has a really good suggestion in chat saying we should try to do a pre-recorded PAX show.

2459
02:55:18,984 --> 02:55:26,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, what I think would be really funny is that maybe there won't be a live show next week, but maybe there'll be some type of recorded show.

2460
02:55:27,230 --> 02:55:35,215
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I'm going to PAX with my buddy Seg, who is part of the Umlaut crew, and my friend Amanda, who's really funny.

2461
02:55:35,335 --> 02:55:37,777
[SPEAKER_05]: She's never been on the show because I think she works a lot Sunday nights.

2462
02:55:38,357 --> 02:55:40,459
[SPEAKER_05]: You've met Amanda, of course, Jamie, right?

2463
02:55:40,719 --> 02:55:41,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Little Amanda?

2464
02:55:41,199 --> 02:55:41,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2465
02:55:41,459 --> 02:55:42,220
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to PAX.

2466
02:55:42,620 --> 02:55:43,381
[SPEAKER_05]: How random is that?

2467
02:55:43,401 --> 02:55:44,482
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to go.

2468
02:55:45,022 --> 02:55:45,583
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're all going.

2469
02:55:45,643 --> 02:55:46,343
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it might be fun.

2470
02:55:46,383 --> 02:55:49,386
[SPEAKER_05]: We might do like a recorded thing, and then I know OLR fans are going to be there.

2471
02:55:49,867 --> 02:55:56,973
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will tell you next week if I'm going to have a hat or a shirt or something to look for me, and I need to look at the schedule.

2472
02:55:57,033 --> 02:55:58,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I can finish your scarf.

2473
02:55:59,335 --> 02:55:59,955
[SPEAKER_05]: You should.

2474
02:56:00,196 --> 02:56:01,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Look for the rainbow scarf.

2475
02:56:01,477 --> 02:56:03,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, too bad you can't make me an orange scarf.

2476
02:56:03,819 --> 02:56:04,740
[SPEAKER_11]: I can make you an orange scarf.

2477
02:56:04,980 --> 02:56:06,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you whip one up in like a week and a half?

2478
02:56:07,822 --> 02:56:08,143
[SPEAKER_11]: This is me.

2479
02:56:08,163 --> 02:56:09,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want me to make you a hat?

2480
02:56:10,518 --> 02:56:12,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you make one that says OLR on it?

2481
02:56:12,920 --> 02:56:13,780
[SPEAKER_11]: Might be a little tough.

2482
02:56:13,860 --> 02:56:14,381
[SPEAKER_11]: Might be a little tough.

2483
02:56:14,421 --> 02:56:14,961
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not that good yet.

2484
02:56:15,001 --> 02:56:17,703
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't I make you just a big obnoxious orange scarf?

2485
02:56:17,923 --> 02:56:19,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, a big obnoxious orange scarf.

2486
02:56:19,324 --> 02:56:19,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.

2487
02:56:19,545 --> 02:56:20,745
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'll even put fuzzy fringe on it.

2488
02:56:20,906 --> 02:56:21,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.

2489
02:56:21,306 --> 02:56:22,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Make it fuzzy and very gay.

2490
02:56:22,947 --> 02:56:23,187
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2491
02:56:23,267 --> 02:56:23,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2492
02:56:23,948 --> 02:56:24,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.

2493
02:56:24,248 --> 02:56:25,549
[SPEAKER_11]: So then that means the rainbow one might have...

2494
02:56:25,589 --> 02:56:26,369
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to wait a little bit.

2495
02:56:26,469 --> 02:56:27,950
[SPEAKER_05]: It's for a good cause.

2496
02:56:28,030 --> 02:56:30,410
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, the Skype line is going to be closed.

2497
02:56:30,470 --> 02:56:30,930
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

2498
02:56:31,070 --> 02:56:32,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be butthurt if you didn't get through.

2499
02:56:32,451 --> 02:56:33,051
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very sorry.

2500
02:56:33,111 --> 02:56:33,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Send us an email.

2501
02:56:33,851 --> 02:56:35,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at orangelaundry.com.

2502
02:56:35,211 --> 02:56:37,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Quick, write it down now, what you were wanting to call in about.

2503
02:56:38,892 --> 02:56:40,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, big, flamey orange scarf.

2504
02:56:41,033 --> 02:56:43,813
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will find a game room.

2505
02:56:43,853 --> 02:56:45,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, they do the game rooms at PAX.

2506
02:56:45,414 --> 02:56:46,834
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to look at what games are going on.

2507
02:56:46,854 --> 02:56:54,296
[SPEAKER_05]: And especially if there's, like, a music-based one, I will make it a point to be there for, like, DDR hour or, you know...

2508
02:56:55,056 --> 02:56:56,776
[SPEAKER_05]: as a throwback to how this show started.

2509
02:56:56,876 --> 02:56:59,277
[SPEAKER_05]: I will make it a point to be there doing a music game thing.

2510
02:56:59,657 --> 02:57:03,198
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know there's quite a few OLR listeners going, so I hope to see you guys.

2511
02:57:03,818 --> 02:57:05,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I like what Actdeft is saying.

2512
02:57:05,218 --> 02:57:08,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Make a pre-recorded, pre-packed show and a best of the same week.

2513
02:57:08,819 --> 02:57:18,101
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be a little weird because, you know, it's not OLR without Loki and Dark Sakura, so I would say it's a spin-off show for the week that might go to the feed.

2514
02:57:18,421 --> 02:57:21,782
[SPEAKER_05]: It would actually be a show called Rob Goes to Packs or something like that.

2515
02:57:22,322 --> 02:57:24,123
[SPEAKER_05]: and then I don't know what DarkSakura and Loki will do.

2516
02:57:24,183 --> 02:57:24,723
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be funny.

2517
02:57:25,043 --> 02:57:27,845
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you guys should just do something fucking random like next week.

2518
02:57:27,905 --> 02:57:30,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Just get together and play a game or something and tape it.

2519
02:57:30,646 --> 02:57:31,246
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be funny.

2520
02:57:32,467 --> 02:57:33,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, we'll talk about that over the next couple weeks.

2521
02:57:34,008 --> 02:57:40,531
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have ideas, email mailbagorangeonestradio.com SSJ100Matt says I should be using the Twitter when I'm at PAX so they can stalk me.

2522
02:57:41,051 --> 02:57:43,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Abso-fucking-lutely I'm going to be on the Twitter.

2523
02:57:43,653 --> 02:57:46,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Prepare to have your Twitters flooded with tweets from PAX.

2524
02:57:47,014 --> 02:57:48,875
[SPEAKER_05]: I will be doing that on the oil.

2525
02:57:48,955 --> 02:57:49,776
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be tasteful.

2526
02:57:49,796 --> 02:57:50,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't worry.

2527
02:57:50,156 --> 02:57:50,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Is Sony supposed

2528
02:57:50,776 --> 02:57:51,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Pax Prime Pax Prime

2529
02:58:19,122 --> 02:58:19,962
[SPEAKER_05]: That was still fun, though.

2530
02:58:20,603 --> 02:58:21,163
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we'll see.

2531
02:58:21,483 --> 02:58:22,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was fun.

2532
02:58:22,163 --> 02:58:22,703
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very fun.

2533
02:58:23,363 --> 02:58:23,664
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2534
02:58:25,944 --> 02:58:29,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Some folks in chat really like the idea of DarkSakura and Loki doing a show without me.

2535
02:58:29,165 --> 02:58:29,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, fine.

2536
02:58:29,726 --> 02:58:30,506
[SPEAKER_05]: I see how you are.

2537
02:58:31,586 --> 02:58:34,847
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100Matt says, have Dan here and have him take Skype calls the whole show.

2538
02:58:35,808 --> 02:58:36,328
[SPEAKER_11]: This will be Dan.

2539
02:58:36,608 --> 02:58:36,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Ring.

2540
02:58:37,628 --> 02:58:38,529
[SPEAKER_11]: Talk to Orange Islands Radio.

2541
02:58:38,729 --> 02:58:38,929
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

2542
02:58:39,189 --> 02:58:39,709
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care.

2543
02:58:39,809 --> 02:58:40,209
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

2544
02:58:41,510 --> 02:58:42,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut the fuck up, junkie.

2545
02:58:43,286 --> 02:58:43,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan, Dan, Dan

2546
02:59:08,018 --> 02:59:08,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Should I say that?

2547
02:59:08,800 --> 02:59:09,161
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2548
02:59:09,201 --> 02:59:10,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe too early?

2549
02:59:10,383 --> 02:59:10,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Too soon?

2550
02:59:11,666 --> 02:59:13,069
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's not too soon.

2551
02:59:13,350 --> 02:59:18,100
[SPEAKER_11]: We're thinking about doing something.

2552
02:59:20,649 --> 02:59:43,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Vault related and I will say this much currently it is just an OLR project it has nothing to do with all games if we can work it in with all games excellent but there's so many great shows on all games that we're planning to do it just to say show that's not live so we'll see more to come and that might not be the only new show coming soon we'll see alright anyhow

2553
02:59:46,129 --> 02:59:47,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, alright.

2554
02:59:48,411 --> 02:59:50,473
[SPEAKER_05]: So, chatters like the idea of a Dan show.

2555
02:59:50,493 --> 02:59:52,454
[SPEAKER_05]: You better see if Dan's going to be available PAX weekend.

2556
02:59:53,174 --> 02:59:54,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell them the chatters demand it.

2557
02:59:54,615 --> 02:59:55,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we're going to wrap shit up.

2558
02:59:55,936 --> 02:59:56,917
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time for us to get out of here.

2559
02:59:57,017 --> 02:59:58,198
[SPEAKER_05]: First, though, last minute stories.

2560
02:59:58,238 --> 02:59:59,479
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if Loki cleared them out.

2561
02:59:59,519 --> 03:00:01,721
[SPEAKER_05]: So, any other last minute stories you guys have?

2562
03:00:01,821 --> 03:00:02,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Kitty!

2563
03:00:02,681 --> 03:00:04,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Kitty YouTubes don't count as last minute stories.

2564
03:00:05,063 --> 03:00:05,543
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I...

2565
03:00:06,764 --> 03:00:08,705
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Maru the Cat.

2566
03:00:32,078 --> 03:00:36,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, there's apparently a new guitar game, or I guess a new guitar that's out there.

2567
03:00:37,640 --> 03:00:39,360
[SPEAKER_03]: This is called the Power Gig Guitar.

2568
03:00:39,760 --> 03:00:42,961
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not only a guitar controller, but it's a real guitar.

2569
03:00:43,761 --> 03:00:45,822
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can apparently use it with rock band and whatnot.

2570
03:00:46,322 --> 03:00:48,902
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can also plug it into an amp and actually play a real guitar.

2571
03:00:50,643 --> 03:00:52,523
[SPEAKER_03]: No word on what the cost is on it, though.

2572
03:00:52,543 --> 03:00:53,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see here.

2573
03:00:54,544 --> 03:00:57,804
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't said what the cost is on it yet, but it looks neat.

2574
03:00:58,705 --> 03:00:59,845
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, if you want a guitar...

2575
03:01:01,447 --> 03:01:04,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I'd probably just buy a separate guitar if that's just me.

2576
03:01:07,563 --> 03:01:08,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Portal 2 is at E3.

2577
03:01:08,243 --> 03:01:08,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Duh, duh, and duh.

2578
03:01:37,148 --> 03:01:37,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

2579
03:01:38,929 --> 03:01:41,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Battlestar Galactica is apparently getting an MMO.

2580
03:01:42,470 --> 03:01:43,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Frackin' awesome!

2581
03:01:44,030 --> 03:01:45,771
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's interesting, though.

2582
03:01:45,811 --> 03:01:54,474
[SPEAKER_03]: It says that it's being developed for SyFy, I guess, by Big Point, which they've done several titles in the genre, I guess, before.

2583
03:01:55,374 --> 03:02:02,537
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess it'll be coming out this autumn on SyFy's website for an exclusive 30-day period.

2584
03:02:02,937 --> 03:02:04,458
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know where it's going from there.

2585
03:02:06,098 --> 03:02:15,584
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta say, since we've now finally done what we told the listeners we were going to do for years and we did our fuck show last week, we might have to do a frack show the week Battlestar Galactica comes out.

2586
03:02:16,965 --> 03:02:18,225
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just kidding.

2587
03:02:18,285 --> 03:02:18,846
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kidding.

2588
03:02:19,886 --> 03:02:21,527
[SPEAKER_05]: We need a new epic show idea.

2589
03:02:21,647 --> 03:02:23,028
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure one will come up soon enough.

2590
03:02:27,129 --> 03:02:40,987
[SPEAKER_03]: there's still the wheel of obscenity that I've wheel of obscenity, turn, turn, turn show us the curse word that we should learn exactly yeah, and that's pretty much it for now

2591
03:02:41,556 --> 03:02:43,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, that's it.

2592
03:02:43,738 --> 03:02:46,439
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to wrap it up and get on out of here for the night.

2593
03:02:46,479 --> 03:02:47,380
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good show though.

2594
03:02:47,440 --> 03:02:48,181
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fun.

2595
03:02:48,221 --> 03:02:49,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of ground covered tonight.

2596
03:02:49,802 --> 03:03:00,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Considering, you know, this was the week that Final Fantasy XIII came out, we did a very good job of talking about a lot of games and not just that one tonight because we talked about it all last week amongst the F-words.

2597
03:03:00,629 --> 03:03:01,891
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2598
03:03:19,910 --> 03:03:40,994
[SPEAKER_05]: you know about this show help us spread the word and if you're like Rob I've told everybody I can't think of anyone else to tell then please post a review somewhere iTunes the Zoom listing Podcast Alley wherever there's plenty of podcasting sites help us spread the word and there's even some folks have gone so far to do forum signatures and stuff that is like way more than we could ask for and really appreciate it just so you know so thank you very much

2599
03:03:41,715 --> 03:03:43,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

2600
03:03:43,757 --> 03:03:44,738
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll start with my final thought.

2601
03:03:44,778 --> 03:03:46,680
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is I want a taco.

2602
03:03:46,800 --> 03:03:48,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, yes, it's a Sunday night tradition.

2603
03:03:48,422 --> 03:03:49,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Taco, taco, taco.

2604
03:03:49,683 --> 03:03:50,645
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

2605
03:03:51,125 --> 03:03:52,106
[SPEAKER_11]: I love my kitty.

2606
03:03:53,328 --> 03:03:54,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, there's Shermie YouTubes now, huh?

2607
03:03:54,829 --> 03:04:01,617
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Shermie has two YouTubes up, but I also was watching Maru the Cat, and that's cute, too.

2608
03:04:02,717 --> 03:04:03,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

2609
03:04:04,280 --> 03:04:10,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Two more weeks, I get to play the Rockstar staff in Grand Theft Auto 4, and I intend on kicking the crap out of them.

2610
03:04:10,631 --> 03:04:11,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to film it somehow?

2611
03:04:13,220 --> 03:04:14,720
[SPEAKER_05]: You gotta make that happen.

2612
03:04:14,760 --> 03:04:15,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Make it happen.

2613
03:04:15,280 --> 03:04:16,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I could do that, I guess.

2614
03:04:16,661 --> 03:04:17,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Make it work.

2615
03:04:17,601 --> 03:04:18,641
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be sweet.

2616
03:04:18,821 --> 03:04:19,081
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

2617
03:04:19,101 --> 03:04:38,886
[SPEAKER_03]: But the problem is, because they're doing an event, because they do these every now and then, and I always miss them, but it's actually during my work time that it happens to take place, and it's teams of two that you get to go play against them, but I'm just gonna kick the crap out of them, and it's gonna be hilarious.

2618
03:04:39,206 --> 03:04:39,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't wait.

2619
03:04:40,046 --> 03:04:40,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't wait.

2620
03:04:40,734 --> 03:04:43,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well thank you guys very much and tune in next week.

2621
03:04:44,018 --> 03:04:46,181
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back next week with more Orange Lounge Radio.

2622
03:04:46,221 --> 03:04:48,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie may be a little late, but that's not going to stop the show.

2623
03:04:48,924 --> 03:04:51,807
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll be back next week with more Orange Lounge Radio.

2624
03:04:51,827 --> 03:04:52,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Jamie?

2625
03:04:52,388 --> 03:04:53,129
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll be here just late.

2626
03:04:53,529 --> 03:04:53,730
[SPEAKER_05]: We.

2627
03:04:53,970 --> 03:04:54,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2628
03:04:54,470 --> 03:04:55,472
[SPEAKER_05]: So see you next week, guys.

2629
03:04:55,492 --> 03:04:56,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a great week.

2630
03:04:57,478 --> 03:05:00,280
[SPEAKER_15]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2631
03:05:00,760 --> 03:05:04,042
[SPEAKER_15]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

03:05:04,462 --> 03:05:13,127

03:05:13,627 --> 03:05:25,233

2634
03:05:25,813 --> 03:05:26,654
[SPEAKER_15]: See you next week!
