{"text": " Tonight, March 14th, 2010, Sony details its new motion controller at GDC, on live promises streaming games for a monthly fee, and soon you can get Xbox achievements on your cellphone. Hello my friends, and welcome to episode number 359 of Orange Lounge Radio, the video game talk show where every gamer has a voice. My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers. Woo. How are you doing? Woo. Woo. That sounds good. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Not like woo, but woo. I like a Ric Flair kind of woo. Alright, also joining us, say hello to Tech Master Loki, who I noticed is eating barbecued chicken. Yes. I have to be sure that I'm not getting chicken sauce on. At least he has chicken. Woo. Barbecued chicken gets a woo? Sure. Alright. I'm almost out of root beer, and that's not good. I got him to put no ice this time so it doesn't water down with that useless frozen water. no one is eating pie and today is pie day happy pie day to all of our listeners we had a donut I don't know if that counts actually I did have something kind of pie like okay I went I like I went to Charlie's Cafe and had the banana cream pie well that's a pie um waffle oh they put pie filling on the waffle oh that's kind of strange delicious and they put chocolate chips on that you dessert for breakfast I know it was no some people eat breakfast for dinner like I didn't really eat anything like for five hours after that because it was like full of pan of waffle waffle II pie goodness waffle and pie I can think of no two better foods unless there was bacon somehow involved you this is funny well I keep messing with cheeseburger in the chat room yes me I don't know why it's just funny all right you want to get it you would yeah well he was asking me what my email address was so I'm like no you had me confused with the other Loki just you know because there is no other Loki in chat he's really confused yeah but now if he's listening to the show he's gonna know you're messing with him so all right I'm done well if you want to join our chat room and get messed with too we do tape live every week at all games radio www.allgames.com at 6 Pacific a big thank you to them for letting us steal their bandwidth every week right after the Bobby Black Wolf show of course daylight savings happen today by the way so we might be on I think let's see we sprang forward so those that don't didn't celebrate it would we would have sprung backwards for them anyhow if you are listening to us live pull up a chair and join us in our chat room chat orange lounge radio.com is the place to be we're gonna get into some gaming news here in a little bit but we always start off just as we have the past several years talking about how is your gaming week and dark soccer what kind of video games you've been playing this week Atari yeah I played Gorf and I played tempest 3000 I played tempest 2000 I played I'll just go ahead and say it I played Space Harrier on the Atari XL hmm a beta interesting is like a new thing or like a prototype that never happened it's a new thing it's developed development right now I met the guy did the soundtrack oh very cool cool um I played what else did I play I played centipede on the Atari XL with a remapped trackball play a little peggle play a lot of actually not really a whole lot of Star Trek online I did like a battle and yeah all right well we'll come back to talk a little later about all the Atari stuff Dan actually got um Gradius the Gradius thing for we the Gradius rebirth yeah the redone Gradius yeah and so it was fun watching him cuss at the Moai heads I didn't but you know I bought that but I didn't really play enough of it I got distracted with something else using of course of course Loki how was your gaming week well not too eventful I played Final Fantasy 13 and I'm made like six hours into it and played more Grand Theft Auto and actually part of the week our internet was down at work or our network in the room that we have the 360s in so we ended up playing some old-school Saints Row one a death or death match multiplayer so that's fun because you could do a system link on those and they don't require Xbox Live and then I did check out the demo for just cause two it's pretty fun not as fun as I would hoped but I think I'd like it kind of got that mercenaries to vibe to it I mean it's very similar obviously to the first just cause game but thankfully it is well very much higher production value than mercenaries to in that game was glitched out every which way possible so I did finish downloading the blur multiplayer beta haven't played it yet so that'll be pretty fun they're supposed to be adding some more codes for that so hopefully I'll be able to give you one Rob so I got one I just I'm in the same boat you are I had so much other stuff going on and I was really excited about blur too but I keep now I'll get into it a minute so yeah I think that's really all I played this week I tried going back to play some more Borderlands but since I've been modding the hell out of it I finally downloaded the patch that's supposed to get rid of all that stuff and it kind of jacked up my game like now it won't load my save game correctly and it's not a big deal because I don't really care about the progress in the game or my level or whatever cuz I've been cheating anyways it's just that I don't have to go do all those quests again because it's a lot of just running around it's really annoying so I have to go through and get to be fixed again and then I'll cheat again oh by the way I am also cheating through Final Fantasy 13 because you can you know edit the save games to do all sorts of crazy stuff if you can cheat it or hack it or crack it Loki's probably done it by the way speaking of hacking and cheating I think Dan wants to talk to you about something related to a Japanese Xbox game okay awesome anyhow if that's it for Loki's gaming week then I'll go ahead my gaming week yeah like Loki said I I got into the blur beta but sadly I've just been so into Final Fantasy 13 that like all of my gaming time has been sucked into Final Fantasy 13 I'm about 16 hours in at this point and I get the sense I am like right before something epic that's gonna happen in the story like again I'm not gonna give out spoilers I am very you know touchy with spoilers too it's like don't even joke and chat like we will kick ban you and we're not at the point I think you have to be about six months out before it's okay to spoil like you know but I get the feeling I'm coming up on something pretty epic about to happen in the game also there's something else that a lot of hints have been dropped for and again I'm being very cautious here I'm not gonna spoil anything because I don't even know if I'm right but I feel like there's been a lot of hints dropped over the past couple hours to something in the story that I kind of didn't see coming and there's one it's one of those like I haven't seen that in a Final Fantasy game before and if I'm right it's kind of one of those well played Square Enix well played I think I think there's something up I can't again I don't want to spoil that uh but definitely the story in the game is really good like you know I think a lot of people played through the first three hours and there's definitely your characters that are likable and dislikable but as that the thing that was mentioned last week the game is like a banana that slowly peels back to reveal all of its layers or maybe like an everlasting gobstopper because it takes so long to get through and there's all these different colored layers you definitely start to see that there is more to the story than what you saw in the first few hours I do like very and I do like the weapon upgrade system because I was like wondering well those components were for big yeah I thought it's gonna be more of like crafting though instead of like okay these components equal X number of experience and your levels go up and the weapon does more damage or whatever well it's interesting it takes so long in the game before you get to that so yes those of you that haven't gotten that far yet yes all that crap you're collecting you will use later on to upgrade your weapons that's not really a spoiler that's that's just a game mechanic that's nobody yeah so but anyway the story I just got to say I if I'm right at what I kind of have a hunch is what's going on I'm gonna be like very interesting and in six months when the moratorium on spoilers is up and it's okay to spoil I want to get into it cuz it's it's I'm just wondering if we kill the cyber Pope because you know he looks like he has it coming my favorite character though I think is still saws because he does have a chocobo that lives in his hair and the chocobo gets a little more personality as the story goes on and it's it's disgustingly cute disgustingly cute and I was gonna say that the Shiva sisters they're their motorcycle is naughty I I am so happy that Final Fantasy has gone back to this just epic over-the-top summons thing in the game like that I you back to like Final Fantasy 7 where it was like Knights of the round and all this well ten yeah ten had it too it did it did there was one ten did have the Shiva that would come out and snap her fingers and then the ice would shatter everywhere it's nice to see that again there was one part though of the game that I didn't like so I mean it was kind of annoying thankfully it was a really short section of the game but you know they kind of tried to change the gameplay up a little bit when you get that little mech thing that you walk around in for about five not even five minutes like two minutes that was a waste of time I can see why some people are kind of in on Final Fantasy 13 because it does change things up a lot and yeah you don't really go out into this world map and go to towns and stuff like you do in a Final Fantasy game you didn't intend either if you think about it remember it was just the airship in different spots that you could kind of drop down into it was exactly these games are kind of like that to Lost Odyssey I there's a lot of I see in I mean besides the battle systems are completely different but like the way you move around the map and everything it's very similar to Lost Odyssey you know you have these relatively linear dungeons with different branches and so forth you know but Lost Odyssey didn't get a lot of crap but clearly Final Fantasy 13 is just have an idea what they think Final Fantasy should be and if it's not that then they're like oh it sucks really when you look at it it's exactly the same as all the other Final Fantasies so what so you don't have to wander around aimlessly in like some overworld for a while big deal tiger claw in our chat room chat that orange launcher dot-com says sky he would have to wash his talking about sass sky he would have to wash his hair every day though to clean out all the chocobo poo I do want to point out the chocobo is capable of flying out of the hair and you do see that happening so he hopefully is potty trained to know to fly out of the hair and go to like a nearby tree or something I don't really get into that and normally animals don't poop where they sleep you know just like just like to show me you know there's just some cases where you don't have to explain the bathroom thing like take 24 for example on the show 24 it's so fast paced and action paced you don't ever stop to really think when do these characters have time to poo when they're not when they're not showing them you know it's just like when it goes to some other character but these are things you do you don't think about because 24 is so action-packed and there's so much going on you're not supposed to be thinking about gee I wonder if Jack's gotta go anyhow is our all the scenes always focused on him what's that are all the scenes always focus no they're not so then he goes he pees well he's usually in situations where it's not like there's a bathroom nearby like when he's robbed depends when he's tied to a chair getting tortured depends all right forget it although that would be awesome to spend a whole episode based on you know him trying to find a bathroom no it would not be awesome actually canceled so oh well no NBC might buy it now that they have five hours available on week nights that's the rumor anyway it can just replace the site show with 24 is a great show although it's one of those shows where it's like I missed an episode so now I can't watch like any of it because you miss one you miss everything it's like lost like people just obsessed with lost and I get why there's a lot to it but but I again if you missed that first episode I think you're just lost period anyhow yeah yeah just like Brad from pod culture said he pees during the commercial break just like everybody else does liquid parrot and chat room ass I'm playing Final Fantasy 13 now I'm getting five stars after every battle but what's the point is there even exp in this game there is not exp but there's crystal points that let you move around the board similar to Final Fantasy tens level up system the stars I believe affect your loot you can sometimes get loot affected by the stars I think more importantly your technic points which I don't know if you're to the point in the game where you're using those yet but they allow you to cast spells like Libra you will see how that comes into play if you're not already there the star ratings affect how fast your bar fills up for technic points so there you go anyhow other games I think I mentioned Wow I'm playing Warcraft my boyfriend and I made it to Outlands on the characters we've been working on for a couple months so yay that and the Megaman 10 came out this week on PlayStation I didn't play it really a lot I just kind of downloaded it and went in and went ooh I pretty and and well not really pretty but retro tastic and and I went in and watched the replays oddly enough that was the first thing I did I went in to watch replays and watch people just do speed runs on these stages that are insane that's kind of a cool thing I don't remember if Megaman 9 had that if it did I just never looked for it but for some reason that jumped right out at me in this Megaman 10 and that was one of the first things I did so I need to play that a little more it's nice though that I can watch movies on how to beat stages when I don't know what to do so that was pretty much it for my gaming week let's go to some housekeeping Jamie you went to an event today where you played all these Atari games give us a little wrap-up on what this was all about I went to the Atari party 2010 which I guess I didn't really know about this before but apparently they do it every year and it was basically this kind of house like structure in Davis you had a kitchen and a big room but they just had Atari systems looked up everywhere and I met a man named Sal who you know I said I was gonna mention his thing but I put my piece of paper with everything on there mention it next week I will definitely make a big mention of it but it was really cool he does a lot of he did soundtracks for a lot of I guess new releases of our ports of other games you know or releases of prototypes and other ones like that right now they're working on outrun in space Harrier for a the Atari XL and the which is a computer version of the the 5200 it's funny his company's called Atlantis games if that was the name because Atlantis was one and I thought I looked it up on Wikipedia real quick just to jog my memory I thought Atlantis was one of those big big Atari 2600 games it was really well loved and yeah there's some screenshots here was that one of those a magic game so it had that very unique looking cartridge with like the orange that was a great 2600 game so I don't know if the company is named and owed to that game or what but that was one of the better 2600 games sorry so I actually um he played a lot of the it's just um some songs that he had done in that format though just for fun like axle F and Actraiser music and Mega Man and different stuff is actually pretty cool isn't amazing Castlevania any synth ask kind of system like you know whenever there's some type of Cynthia type sound involved always has axle F and somehow Van Halen's jump usually makes an appearance at some point to maybe he didn't do it but somebody did well at any rate they also had this is keeping my brain kind of fried from being out so long but they had the DVD game system you know how some of the DVDs for all they were doing like a game system hooked up to it so they had a version of tempest 3000 what I remember tempest 3000 yeah let me see if I can pull it up real quick was that what are those those like little joysticks you hook up to the television but yeah yeah I'm gonna find it interesting well okay so um tempest 3000 and by the way it is gorgeous um it uh I'm trying to find what was on it was um because I obviously I remember to the new one the new one is what it is Wow um the it was a DVD a system that had enhanced DVD tools in it and 3d video game playability on it so uh only a few things came out on it but so far I think just tempest 3000 is the only real notable but they had one there and had it hooked up there's a link a picture of it to the chat room but that's uh it looks like an n64 that's what I first Wow that's coming in so I had looked at it and I was like oh no that's a new one yeah so um but I played tempest 3000 and there was actually some video up of Dan playing tempest 3000 because I recorded stuff with my iPhone Jordan on your YouTube it's on my YouTube right now so it's on your YouTube channel yeah I'm gonna give that out publicly or yeah it's all our dark Sakura or dark Sakura or something you know it can you find it Rob yeah um but uh I uh it's a lot of battery your dark Sakura or lr but yeah I did like a couple of sweeps of the party and you know just you know I took a few screens on here's tempest 3000 I want to kind of play this a little bit tempest 2000 but it plays on the laser the DVD players that have you on should I got you to put these on the olr YouTube that's all right I'm just trying to get a look at the game here it's sorry I know this doesn't mean for a great radio but yeah it's very blurry that's the problem with it this is an HDTV it would be a lot better but it's why I still say I prefer tempest 2000 to tempest 3000 because tempest 3000 gives me a headache the score is gigantic in the corner that's kind of the music's the same Wow almost makes me wanna see a new one get added to the gaming vault I can't imagine if I could find one I'm sure they're pretty expensive very cool all right so sorry I was not aware of tempest 3000 yes I would say it's one of those things I've heard of before but I just really haven't seen emotions I've covered it I've covered it when I was covered tempest yeah but it's it's one of those hearing about it and seeing it or and playing it are three different things there were you know there were Jaguars all over the place and you know all varieties of Atari systems it was pretty fun it was pretty fun and I'm actually thinking I'll find the stuff a little bit later for everybody but the the guy I talked to has an eBay store and he sells the refurbished excels for like 70 bucks which isn't bad because you know they're all you know set up to work with s video so and you know he sells most of cartridges that they do for like 30 bucks I mean it is you know time and effort went into it is pretty much a new version of the game except he did tempest extreme well they did tempest extreme that because of how much work and everything that went into getting it to run properly it's actually a 50 buck game but I've seen it in motion played it well worth it so it was pretty good all right the Atari party a little local event sounds like a PlayStation there and I was like hey you're at the Atari party or were they playing the Atari collection maybe on the PlayStation night that might be so no I just heard the little PlayStation chime and I was like hey that doesn't belong here you get that or you get that out oh and um they also had one of the mountain you know ran into Neil there mm-hmm and I didn't get to see it he cuz I was talking to the the XL the guy had south we were talking about the music and everything by the way since I don't think Neil's ever been on this program he's no buddy of mine from like junior high school we've known each other a very long time and so he goes some of these nerd things too yeah you he also does rocky a big part of that and is a big nerd so he also gave me that I'm act that's collecting dust under the pinball table but the crap he told me that they had choo-choo rocket on one of on the the you know I'm gonna see what what it is oh what are the Atari systems like somebody poured in it yeah no Wow I'm seeing what it was I just you know completely unplugged my phone sorry on a 1040 Wow so that's pretty cool lots of retro love people still making new games on old systems it's kind of funny and yes Amiga 777 it was a Jaguar someone had Jaguar CD hooked up to iron soldier was one of the engineer playing so I was like hey whatever all right let's um other housekeeping tonight don't forget to use our use our Twitter join us on Twitter we'll be taking Twitter topics a little later in the show twitter.com slash o-l-r and you also can add us on Facebook orange lounge radio and we have a live journal community to it orange lounge we have an update from Breslull the usl madness the tournament to find the greatest video game of all time is almost over it's almost a done deal we have an update from Breslull on what's going on on our forums hello all our this is Russell I'm giving you another update on the madness tournament in our forum we're actually down to the final four it's late for the past versus Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 6 versus Ocarina of Time I'm pretty sure yes Chrono Trigger versus Lake of the past and Ocarina of Time versus Final Fantasy 6 those are the final matchups we don't have that many votes but both matchups are incredibly close so be sure to get your votes in tonight if you're listening live if you're listening via the podcast pay attention to the forums because the final matchup will be coming this week and we will have a new winner of the madness tournament for more information once again log on to www. orange lounge radio.com and click on forums talk to you guys later bye bye very interesting matchup in the final four is it to Zelda games somehow made it to the final four but Final Fantasy 6 is up against Ocarina of Time got to tell you my vote went to Final Fantasy 6 that's that's one of my favorite Final Fantasy is probably I don't know if I do I would give it the six to I and don't get me wrong I realize I've said my piece on Ocarina of Time and it's still a great great great game but Final Fantasy 6 is like a great great great great great game the other matchup is Link to the Past versus Chrono Trigger I personally voted for Link to the Past but I know of course Chrono Trigger has this extremely loyal fan base I really wouldn't be surprised to see that win although what you know Link to the Past if I had a Super Nintendo sitting in front of me and both of those carts I'd reach for Link to the Past I would I would probably play through more of that one sitting than I could Chrono Trigger too but anyway it doesn't really matter what I think it's what you guys think so go check that out in our forums we'll have more updates on the winner and if you don't like the games that are there we'll poo on you you should have been voting or sending your top 25 list like we told you to like couple months ago so if you missed your chance this year don't worry you have get to do it all again next year all right um let's see SHA100 Matt in our chat says Ocarina isn't a Link to the Past that's true but Link to the Past did have an Ocarina in it if I remember right didn't it wasn't it one of the early ones where you at least it had like a whistle type thing like some sort of whistle that looked like an Ocarina it's kind of like a really really old integration of that anyhow let's get into some actual gaming news what is going on new in the world obviously lots and lots happened this week we gave developers conference but first some other big news that wasn't from GDC right Loki yeah there's and this isn't too surprising just you know from their track record of what's been released recently but apparently Majesco is kind of going the way of Midway and Atari where it's now being threatened by Nasdaq with a delisting apparently again this is not the first time that this has happened the company now has 180 calendar days to bring its stock a price above $1 per share the minimum required to remain on the exchange the trick is though that they can't it it can't just pop up it's a fiscally or fiscally hurting head above a bucket for a day and everything will be good you know fine it has to stay above the $1 mark I guess for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days prior to August 30th 2010 now if you think about it Majesco hasn't released much for a while I mean you're really there big franchise right now is cooking mama and cooking mama's what like gardening mama and I mean they've kind of dug that into the ground haven't they yeah I mean it's they've got a few games coming out of like there's a Pirates of plunder are supposed to be coming out soon but I mean come on between Pirates of plunder flips twisted world you know a bunch of these secondary titles there for the Wii and yes I just don't I don't really see this happening I mean they don't have a date they put out the mad dog McCree pack on Wii oh whoa well I guess I'm wrong I know exactly yeah I'm looking at the list of Majesco stuff and I'm kind of like oh boy oh there's I mean they have the Teen Titans license which I'm sure sell some games I mean I'm not I'm not really they haven't used they haven't put I haven't done in a while a few years they have a Texas Hold'em game on DS but those are a dime it does those are like years old okay stray the blood rain games but again those are kind of old news they haven't been doing a no they've only really been doing like DS and Wii titles and they've been very secondary I'm sorry to say I mean like like I said the last few games have come out from them okay Data East arcade classics collection yeah that's a nice collection of games but it's not gonna sell like the the copies that they need the make money I mean it's just no triple-a title or even really a titles a lot of let me a lot of seat on this way like a company in like 505 games I mean they're like pretty brand-new I mean they're relatively new like a few years old and they put out a lot of crap but they're putting out more games and these guys are and they actually have some decent titles coming up that are pretty notable like naughty bear or something like that well they may not also be traded on the stock market either keep in mind that we're not talking about if they get delisted from the stock market they're gonna just go under immediately although that's although that's a side effect yeah but it well it's our Atari's still kicking I mean not as much as they used to but they're kicking they're kicking with the float even there you know kickboard but it's just it's not what it was I mean Midway they went under and all their assets got bought out Majesco I could see that happening I mean you know gardening mama that could be something or like you know the cooking mama series that could be something that probably fit with like Ubisoft even SSJ 100 Matt makes an excellent point in our chat room chat that orange on city.com they should have brought president cat over before they go under because president cat would be a triple-a title indeed it would hold out hope for e3 at Majesco's booth you never know you never know if president cat does show up at e3 I will be going over to the booth of the person who had the balls to put it out saying would you like to shake my hand I'd be all sorts of like crazy oh by the way and it you know like they did with any three last year in Nintendo's press conference oh by the way here's a Metroid other M trailer it's like oh by the way I think we have a candidate for a perfect title this holiday season this election season we have the candidate for you I would just I'd lose it I would all right yeah I'd be on the floor shaking and crying all right now all right for real though other stuff going on quaking in your mantis I would I would anyhow PlayStation move was revealed this week a game developers conference I'm sure any of you guys that actively follow the gaming blogs have heard about this it's not the arc or anything like that it is the PlayStation move is the name of the controller and it made its debut at GDC they are promising that it will launch for less than $100 which means like what $99 right $99.99 $99 and then there's been a lot of the little thing that they were doing their conference talking about so calm for because so calm is going to be the big franchise that gets the support of PlayStation move this year and they were cut I noticed they went out of their way to say look how you don't go flailing about like you know they really kind of tried to poke fun at the weed very subtly they said notice how he's not flailing about he made these very subtle motions and I gotta say granted I'm not a so calm player so I didn't really know what to look for but you could see the dude sitting there and if it was a live demo which I have no reason to doubt that it was it looked pretty yeah he's just kind of using it as a another way to control the game that's just like you know the Call of Duty games that are on the Wii I mean it's it can be done I mean you can just use the the one controller as a pointer and then the other one the kind of control your movements and then maybe throw in some different like motion sensitive commands that you can do for different things well I know they were trying to really make it a point to to say look at the precision this thing has great precision this is a precise controller like they were really trying to take a jab at the fact that the we can sometimes be a little all over the place and I do agree it's probably gonna be more precise but because they've had more time to perfect the technology exactly but I mean from what they're showings were of what they're gonna be putting out come on you're not that much better than Nintendo like for example iPad well okay iPad you know and now we finally understand why that title is delayed forever and and that's kind of neat it's different because it's a little bit of augmented reality stuff in there but mainly I was saying you know move party come on oh great more party game collections yeah it's like you know what though if that's what sells that's what sells no no no and I don't have a problem with them doing that because it's kind of neat to see like you know that kind of a party game with actually good graphics in it you know what I mean and it would be neat if they actually figure out unique ways to do this but do they've got an archery game in there it's just like the fucking archery game and we sports you know resort HD oh who cares well to be fair there's a Lord of the Rings game coming to for what it's worth that's a port of a Wii game and looks like it and then they do they did make sure to stress that they had so many companies behind it like they showed a slide where there was just logos all over pretty much all their big publishers are jumping on board with move somehow which isn't too big of a surprise honestly it'll just be interesting to see if there's that must have game there's that must-have game that really sells the move I don't know if so com4 is it I mean so com4 don't get me wrong so com4 there's a lot of so com fans and especially because they they've made it a point to say you don't have to use move you don't want it was just you know something that's there too exactly and I like how they do have the option there and options are good I'm surprised Sony's jumping on that bandwagon because you know that wasn't really something that was their mantra but so calm isn't really that title that has crossed the line to get everybody interested including the soccer moms which are important because it's their credit card usually with the kids you know it'll be neat just I think the PlayStation moves like the move party stuff will be okay especially if they're gonna bundle that with the software but my thing is though too is you gotta buy you know at least one of these is gonna come with your kit or whatever that's gonna have the camera which I don't even really need this because I have the camera already okay so you have to buy one of those controllers which let's assume it's the same price as you know the Wii the Wii remotes like 40 bucks okay well those things they have two of them they have one that's kind of like a nunchuck type of controller air sub controller whatever that looks exactly the same I have a feeling it's gonna be another $40 okay so great I have you an $80 set of controllers here that's for one player now I need it for the other three Oh goody so there you know what you've spent a good 200 you know three hundred and twenty dollars on fucking controllers dark soccer oh what are your thoughts on move what's with the light bulb I think isn't it like be able to see the different players and where they are in the room type of thing um that and because it's something that the camera can track oh yeah cuz it's all camera that's why they have LED thing little like glowing balls on like people when they're motion capturing them and stuff like that hmm I don't know again I'm kind of torn like I'm I look at PlayStation move and I go oh okay neat I like what Sony's doing with that but then I look at it and go yeah but there's nothing I there's nothing that's gonna make me run out and buy this day one right now you know again I'm not really the SOCOM fan that doesn't really speak to me I don't know these minigame collections don't look anything better than the Wii except maybe the graphics there's nothing that makes me go OMG got to get one of these day one here's the problem is that they haven't figured out why they're not selling as well that's really what it comes down to is they think oh my god it's because you know this other console has motion sensitive stuff that's why it's selling well no it's because it has casual games and games that feel the family so that's why it's selling well I just think it's too little too late you think they're jumping into this too late heck yeah hmm I mean I think that the Microsoft has the better idea you know well basically what they're trying to do with this is that they're trying to put it themselves on equal footing with the Nintendo Wii and basically then it's gonna be okay look these both of these systems have you in the motion technology now let's compare the rest of the features and when you compare the rest of the features the we just looks like something for the last generation minute this thing comes out there will be that bundle that includes move that they're really gonna be pushing the holiday season hey it's a blu-ray and a we type thing in one that's that's what it is that's Sony's strategy I'm sure it does everything it only does everything except but to be fair I mean Sony's made a lot of made a lot of ground in the past couple years I mean I think they've got to do this they're so way behind in the numbers and it's it's a good idea but here's the other thing even with the toll the toll is going to be the same problem I think and even to a greater extent at least with the tall and I'll give them credit for this at least in the tall I don't the fucking buy $320 with the controllers it's the camera that's it done I don't have to make any more fucking purchases at all well speaking of the tall I think dark soccer has got a story for us that kind of talks about Microsoft although they didn't they didn't get to do the keynote at GDC if that doesn't mean there's no news on the tall well um they're basically stating that they're gonna have the full lineup of the natal titles at e3 which will be cool of course they've got EA Capcom turn 10 spawn point behind them and that they are quote putting their best people on the on the job so uh they should actually be seeing some pretty good stuff this June what big Xbox franchise do you think might natal be I mean I guess we've heard fable already yeah my thought and I remember making this prediction earlier in the year and I don't remember if it was on the show or on one of the forums or what have you but I remember saying I think Gears of War 3 is gonna be unveiled at e3 and it's gonna have natal support and it's kind of funny that SOCOM showed up with the PlayStation move because when I saw that I was like wow that's kind of that's kind of close ish that's like Playstations kind of sudary type game as long as they take a mature approach with it like you know where it's it makes sense for the game not just it seems tacked on as long as they layling about like an idiot but they they Sony made a big point to say you will not flail around like an idiot so if they do it right again I'm talking out my ass it just seems like it's odd to me we have heard nothing about Gears of War 3 I have this strange feeling you know it's gonna happen those games are huge sellers I have this strange feeling that's the elephant behind the curtain that's gonna show at e3 when dark soccer talks about they're bringing all their natal titles I my gut tells me that's one of them oh I'm also though looking in terms of course there's gonna be sports games that are gonna use it although I would like to see how it would work with like a racing game if it would be something like you foresee you know what I mean well I think they showed in one of those previews right somebody was like grabbing us I think there was like a racing game you see the little happy family grabbing a steering wheel yeah you know natal I'm approaching with this big grain of salt as to how well it's actually gonna work because I go I feel like it's like the PlayStation I now granted the or not the I the I toy sorry granted the technologies come a long way in the past few years I just really hope we see that and I hope at e3 they show natal in a realistic environment and not against a really well-lit white wall although you know that's what they're gonna do so that it's super uber responsive because part of me is like how's this really gonna work in my living room I want them to do it in front of a big red wall or something or what a tacky curtain out of the 1970s I could see in my house or like remember the we demo stations I had up at e3 that year with the couch mm-hmm they just made little living rooms why don't they do something like that I'm hoping that's what we see again I don't know e3 is a couple months away I don't even know if I'm going at this point to be honest I want to go but I want to but I have other priorities this year yeah not this year I just really the only thing that I think right now is an advantage for them is that I don't buy extra accessories because really that's gonna be just like and that's gonna be a big I hope they push that it's okay hey look you gotta buy $320 worth of crap and granted I'm throwing these numbers out my ass but I mean look at the we lesser technology same price you know I gotta buy all this kind of extra stuff to get to work versus its camera it's done you just plug it and go you are the controller you know that's it but then again since I am the controller I can only see ridiculous shit happening with that setup because they're gonna make you flail around they're gonna make you do stupid shit that's unnecessary just like those stupid little concept demo videos that they had where people are screwing in nuts on a fucking tire in a race or something like that it's unnecessary but they think of some really cool ways to like you know play first-person shooters somehow more power to them I will see a little ways off but again I think Microsoft's gonna have that same approach to Sony come the holiday season now it's the Xbox 360 with in the tall or whatever they call it I mean it's not gonna mean it's all I it's not gonna be that either it's kind of weird they still have not announced the name but I guess like you know they could still do it at e3 announce the name until they announce name it's funny GDC I get it but but he threes it's fun up a little why they named it moved right because they couldn't get the trademark for arc well really yeah who had a trademark uh there's some some issue with them not being able to get you get the trademark so they have to go with move instead I think PlayStation moves a better name just from the because their logo still the arc but it's an a looking thing I kind of think it's the better name for the mass market I think a lot of other but then again what do I know the we what a dumb name that was and yet it worked I tend to strategy why it worked I know simple easy to remember easy market they made they made it into a adjective for games like to Xerox something or to get a Kleenex they made the we just like how people used to say oh we know we isn't we is not a generic yet no I know it's not a generic but it's that got that household recognition it'd be like bounty for paper towels all right let's move on with some more gaming news that maybe don't involve motion well it might but we never know oh that's true that's true that was something they're talking about but apparently though it has been announced that Rockman 3 will be making its way out this holiday season not a big surprise I mean they took kind of a year off file that next to duh and of course yeah so I'll be out this this holiday season of course they said that's going to innovate and then revolutionize the music genre once again obviously they're gonna be adding of course you know the three-part harmonies in there again in fact another game that will feature said three-part harmonies is also Green Day Rock Band which has now been announced to be releasing on June 8th worldwide also on the three major platforms Xbox 360 ps3 and we and it's of course we'll use up to six players three mics three instruments and they will also have apparently the ability to import the tracks as well or export the tracks in the Rock Band 2 as well there's gonna be all 47 tracks that are in the game will be exportable for I guess 10 bucks so it's basically Beatles Rock Band but now with I'm day and you can export the tracks I don't even see it as this this release to me is not even as big as Beatles Rock Band I think this is more like guitar your own Metallica but at least you can export the tracks can't do that shit with Metallica or Beatles or Van Halen yeah or reels but Beatles that was a different situation it was kind of Beatles are in a little category of their own to you know it Beatles is there there's not a lot of bands that can get away with just being in their own bubble the music game genre but Beatles can Green Day don't think they're there yet but this this is this will be nice for them they have I mean they have a lot of easily recognizable songs that you know I think the export feature will be very popular too yeah and also they said that there's gonna be a special edition Green Day Rock Band Plus that will come as to Xbox 360 and ps3 for $69.99 includes fancier packaging and an export feature I guess a voucher to export the discs to the hard drive and six previously released Green Day DLC tracks um at depth in our chat room chat that owners on trading com says also George Harrison's son already said that there would be a rock band 3 and it will help you learn to play real instruments wouldn't that be interesting if that's kind of the tie-in is is more making it real I don't know I part of me says maybe there should be a new instrument but then I think it came up a couple months ago on the show I think the idea had come up that maybe what rock band 3 is gonna introduce is something like the sing star space where you upload your own stuff to like a youtubey type of site I my gut tells me that's gonna be rock band threes thing especially with the network taking off as it is and so forth I think rock band 3 is gonna be really about now you can watch your friends rock out from you know across the country all I gotta say man is by the time that comes out I mean it's ridiculous the amount of tracks you can have you can have like about over a thousand tracks right now that are in that game I mean that's the way you do a music game right there you have the download content I mean literally there's a whole library of stuff to pick from and you can just take keep taking it with you through each and you know reiteration of the game all right well moving on to other news kind of a follow-up to last week you know obviously last week we had a very fun show here at olr while the Oscars were going on but something else that was going on at the time was that Ubisoft games were unplayable because they're their whole service was down and apparently and I think I had suggested this when somebody said it on the show it was indeed a DOS attack it sounds like hackers went in servers were attacked which limited service from 2 30 p.m. to 9 p.m. Paris time 8 30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Eastern that was announced by by the company on their Twitter so of course they wanted to cover their tracks real quick saying oh but yeah most players 95% of players they weren't affected yeah because most people were still sleeping on the west coast at that time but still no I mean in all seriousness they tried to cover themselves saying a bunch of players weren't affected probably because they didn't try to play the game but again just kind of goes to show how their DRM system is ridiculous and was already cracked as we talked about last week correct yes because there's the code in there that very similar to steam if steam ever goes bankrupt which I don't think they're going to anytime soon no steam were to ever go under all those games would have to be activated without steam's presence and Ubisoft's games have something similar someone found it and went and unlock that for everybody hey what's this button do ah there it is togak in our chat room says haha I hope they get DDoS more so they learn their lesson I don't know if I'm really an advocate of DDoS thing but I think this certainly shows the weakness of why this should have never been done in the first place yep ah well how about something that's a little bit less irritating what do you think Rob sure Akira Yomoka huh he's good to hear about him he is the less irritating what's he up to lately I it's nice to hear him on a video game podcast because you know when he left Konami there was a little worried that oh he's leaving to go start a band or do something not to do with games whatsoever we did a panel at game developers conference that I'm talking about as long as audio is fun the game will be too that's what it was called but he was talking about how the audio how the music goes into provoking a certain emotion like it one of the examples given is that if you sync the sound just off by a few frames of animation that like if you do it beforehand it'll give a tone of anxiety to it but if you do it afterwards it's more comforting like starting the sound of footsteps just a fraction of you know a moment before the the action happens on the scene and they're talking about the use of silence and he's quoted as saying when there's no sound the brain fills in the gap and then actually went to play you know some music with with gaps of silence and then went back in and added sharp sounds to it of course which freaked people out but it was I think it's very effective and then he played some guitar for everybody to chill him out I could see that because that's kind of silent Hills thing is that sometimes it'll be very quiet when you're walking around all you hear those footsteps that I'm sure are off sync like he talks about there you walk around with the footsteps and all of a sudden you start hearing the radio noise the very uncomfortable kind of noise and that's how you know something's up interesting to kind of hear the science behind that it's it's it's simple psychology I mean they even you know I remember back in the day when I took music theory they were talking about the use of sharp dissonance or how about are setting things in a certain key like setting thing if I remember correctly setting things in the key of E is actually a very uncomfortable key to listen to things in I mean the setting and see very neutral you know same type of thing Wow there's a whole science behind it no word though about sadly what he's working on now or what have you you know I was it wasn't there some rumor something came up a while back that he was in cahoots with EA doing something I want to say something had come up on the show like a while ago maybe one of the chatters wants to fill in I seriously think though we haven't heard on the article though yeah very cool all right let's travel around the world and look at some release dates and what's coming out to a video game store near you that maybe won't make you so uncomfortable well these games make me uncomfortable because I can't believe that they're still being made well technically this is not really a new game it's just kind of remade anyways Pokemon heart gold and soul silver are out today on the Nintendo DS later this week we're getting a spectral force Genesis on DS as well one of the big games this week of course God of War 3 making its way out on PlayStation 3 the expansion for Dragon Age origins awakening will be coming out on PC and Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 this week as well fragile dreams feral ruins of the moon on the Wii that's actually a pretty decent game build a bear welcome hugsville on DS coming from Activision who bought that game from game factory why would you purchase that title I don't know Metro 2033 coming out on PC and Xbox 360 this week Sam X to be on time and space coming out as a collection on PC and the Wii this week that's the entire collection of season 2 infinite space on Nintendo DS this week a game based off a guess at Disney Channel series sunny with a chance on an intended yes another builder bear game friendship Valley coming to the Wii yippie-skippy for PC though this is pretty big RTS game command and conquer for Tiberium Twilight coming out on PC this week residents of fate the other RPG you should be playing coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 kind of a cool game actually that one's a little bit like Final Fantasy but instead of using like magic and stuff you actually use like oozies and rocket launchers which is all sorts of cool hidden mysteries Buckingham Palace secrets of kings and queens on the DS another casual title there pizza delivery boy kind of a little bit across between cooking mama and crazy taxi on the Wii Hall of Fame ultimate hoops challenge budget basketball game on the Wii and not really a game but the new elites are supposed to be coming out this week bundled with Halo 3 ODST and Forza 3 and that's it all right traveling over to Japan to look at the releases that are coming out over there on the Xbox 360 Darksiders comes out kind of say actiony ish game from Konami that I've seen described as God of War meets Zelda I'm sure that's interesting also on the Xbox 360 Momo to Jai Dyson Ryaku ultra deluxe comes out kind of a strategy type of game with these chibi little bombers and of course anime girls as the captains but it looks kind of cute don't think that'll be a game that comes out here though so you'll have to import that one that's pretty much it on the Xbox 360 PlayStation 3 has some exciting titles this week though PlayStation 3 is having something in Japan coming out this week called torn and it's also coming out with a bundle and it's not a game actually it's a DVR type system that I guess will turn your ps3 into a DVR type thing with listings and everything and I'm just thinking wow I wish something like that would come out here that sounds pretty awesome you hear about this like on the 360 in Europe with the what the u-verse I think and maybe that happens in like a limited capacity here but sadly you don't work on my cable system but that is coming out in Japan this week very cool also Ryu Ga Gotoku 4 Densetsu wo Sugumono 4 comes out this week in Japan I believe that is Yakuza 4 which is kind of funny because we just got Yakuza 3 this week in the u.s. so and of course is some of the articles that we've had recently on orange laundry calm written by our lovely webmaster deke man they cut some crap out of Yakuza 3 which is not making people happy I was thinking I was Twitter you saying something like 20 different side quests and stuff we're all cut so hopefully if they do decide to port Yakuza 4 which just came out on the ps3 in Japan this week they will not cut so darn much also on the ps3 this week in Japan the God of War collection it makes its way to Japan that's pretty much it on the ps3 going to the Nintendo Wii there really isn't much there's just one little title from Squeenix Oh Yaku de Asobo Miphi no Omocha Bako I wouldn't get too excited because I said that was Squeenix it honestly looks like like a Sesame Street type of game featuring little rabbit characters that honestly their mouths look like buttholes like I don't have a better way to explain it but if you look at their little mouths they look like balloon knots and I wouldn't yeah get too excited about that but hey there you go what are they showing to their children over there Sengoku Basara 2 on the PlayStation 2 gets a price reduction this week and going over to the Nintendo DS Haki Oki on the DS from idea factory a crayon game yay crayons and lastly going to the PSP Gundam assault survive comes out and oh this is a fun one of it Jamie will be excited for this ease one and two the seven set comes out in Japan nice they've ported those games a couple times over in Japan haven't they I like East I don't think I've seen him out over here oh I've got yes are they are they okay very cool all right Kevo in our chat wants to know why did the hell they cut so much of it I believe speaking about Yakuza 3 I believe long story short there were some things that they felt were well a you could just say they were being lazy but they rationalized it I think some of it was like mahjong minigames which you know it's not really a huge game here in the US so I guess they figured people would know how to play it and I think types of just like social things that are big in Japan because you know you the Yakuza series is very big on trying to like emulate what Japan is feeling like in a certain era so there's a lot of like social things that are built into the game and I guess Sega just felt some things were not worth translating or trying to explain to the English audience but obviously some of the hardcore fans are a little ticked off I see a lot of friends of mine really into this game though so I don't think it's really affecting you know I think if you're a fan of Yakuza you're gonna grumble and cry but you still end up playing it so all right let's move on to the UK dark Sakura on the 16th we have Dragon Age origins awakening the 17th perfect dark and on the 18th the calling on we 19th blaze blue calamity trigger command and conquer for Tiberian Twilight God of War 3 Metro 2033 moto GP 910 and supreme commander to it yeah all right okay let's see so one of the big things that they were talking about during GDC and actually something that might be kind of talked about during e3 last year was on live the streaming service that's gonna be available for I guess PCs and max that's gonna allow you to play basically a whole bunch of you know big games everything from like crisis to you know just very casual games and they're all gonna be able to be streamed I guess to your you know PC with just you know very little hardware whatsoever and they announced that they're gonna be launching their service June 17th and it will be $15 per month and what's gonna you know offer this is depending on I guess you know they're gonna have like a micro console that's gonna be released later on I guess like a set-top box if you will that you can actually use instead of your PC and I guess also you'll be able to they're gonna have some upgrades later on they're gonna offer 1080p support at 60 frames per second as I guess more bandwidth becomes available and on live I guess is gonna be going the first like three months they're only only allow 25,000 people in I guess they're gonna be staggering all when people can join up probably because they don't have all their servers online but I mean I don't know if you're gonna want to jump on board right away because really they're not gonna have a whole lot of titles available at launch they're really only gonna have less than about 20 titles at launch and it's gonna grow somewhere to about 50 to 60 games by 2011 some of the games that they're gonna be available on the service they are mentioning that Mass Effect 2 Dragon Age origins also later on Prince of Persia the Forgotten Sands will be available and apparently I guess 250,000 people signed up for the online beta not that all of them were let in and it says they expect that demand will far outweigh the capacity of the services servers and so that they're gonna actually have people pre subscribe well of course they want to fluff it up sold out hard to get into exclusive you know because they want to pump people up I explain you know I'm not knocking this because certainly I think this story has kind of come up before and you know it's kind of been just poo-pooed office oh yeah sure that'll happen but now there's no really we're gonna have this out in the fall and we plan to do this console and everything but explain to me real quick and I realize there's a science behind this but I need it really broken down for me here because I don't understand hardware so much how is this not game tap this is basically I don't know I think it's gonna be more sophisticated games basically it's not just like emulating old games or older PC titles it's like you're you know say for example you have a crappy computer that happens to be on a decent network you can run crisis now on it basically with very little lag or no lag at all burnout you're gonna be able to run that kind of stuff who knows if they'll go into a game tap type of situation later on where they're gonna have older classic games and stuff like that what was this also something about like maybe it's not really running on your computer it's running on someone else's computer a server you're looking like through a window type of thing basically yes that's so strange to me yeah cuz game tab you have to wait for stuff to download to your computer so I'm assuming it's a little different there and this also they're gonna also have a kind of an online game portal that's gonna be free as well on top of all this stuff it's basically like a browser-based streaming device they're also gonna have like you know free streaming of selection of demos as well so I guess the limited number of full games for rent at for a per game fee without the monthly service charge so kind of think of like what game tap did except not free you know like their little free offerings I don't know it's it's interesting I just don't know if I would really I would probably not use this I just don't play enough PC games toy gak says if it runs on their computers I might be able to play modern games again maybe that's I mean that's the whole like catch to this I think that's yeah it's it's it's so it's kind of like having your PC as being a console where she don't worry about your PC being up to spec to run these games well you just have to have a fast enough internet connection and their PCs will do the work for you interesting I'm really curious to see how this runs like especially if it's if it's really that smooth because I would think I would think that this would run into a similar problem is the whole Ubisoft thing is that if your internet stops working the game stop working because how else are you gonna get the data from the computer well yeah that's just goes with anything as far as like streaming content goes you know you're on demand or anything if your connections stops working then obviously yes it will shut off but that's the same with like a phone call if your phone service goes out then your phone call goes down but you know and I guess it would matter you know it would be you have to make sure that your data center wherever that you're connecting on live you know if their data center goes down or wherever nearby then yeah you'd be kind of screwed chat let me pose this question to chat real quick is on live something that interests you why or why not and I'll kind of ask the folks the studio here the same question is on life something that interests you why or why not logy no and the reason why is because I don't play a lot of PC games anyways and a lot of the games that it seems like that they're gonna have on here are also console crossovers which I would just play on a console on my own time if I was doing that I don't see why honestly I don't have a lot of time for games anyways nowadays and I only seem to be playing like one game at a time I can't see myself paying $15 a month for this I'm gonna say no for the same reasons that Loki said well I should I'm I'm interested like I'm curious to see how it works in action but I think Loki hit the nail on the head console crossovers most of this is already the stuff that's on consoles and and I built my PC to run crisis so god damn it if I'm gonna play crisis it's gonna be running on my PC Dark Sakura I don't know if this is something that would interest you on live being able to have your low-end computer stream the games I don't really care about that honestly you know if I'm gonna if I'm gonna play my live games I'm just gonna sit down and play them on my Xbox kick down off of Borderlands all right am I is something wrong with Chad I got really quiet in there I'm a little worried chat orange launch radio.com it's all the hallucinogens I piped through the internet keep in mind there's also a delay so when I say something it takes like a minute just because we encode to all games who encodes to the shout you know and dah-dah-dah-dah so there's a little bit of a delay between when we say things when they hit the chat room but finally we're getting some feedback here on act deaf in our chat room says no because in Mexico if the service will even be available here we don't have a really good connection speed it's gonna be laggy as hell probably Bochi Kawa says interested but really I don't find it worth it yeah I mean you know you're asking someone to pay an extra subscription fee a month but it's it feels to me like that's the other thing is paying for something that I could just go sit in the other room well you still have to pay for games on the Xbox well yeah but pay more well how is it different from a gamefly account I don't have a gameplay account I would think a gamefly account would be the better option if you ask me granted you can't stream a whole bunch of different games at a time but you got to ask yourself really are you playing like 10 games at a time I mean are you gonna go on the service and go hey you know what I'm gonna play 12 different games this month I mean that's great to think that you might do that but in all reality you're probably not gonna it's gonna be hard to keep track of what's going on in each different game and I know you know back to the day I even then I still didn't really play a ton of different games I'm usually playing one game to completion or till I get tired of it and move on to something else you're not gonna see I'm the opposite I'm gamer a DD all the way I play one thing and then what not again what but like the fact that I'm playing Final Fantasy 13 two weeks in a row pretty solidly is is really it's it's an event like if you listen to past months of this show didn't go find another game that I have that much attention you wouldn't feel lost if he didn't have like these other you know options like I mean I I just don't see you know 40 or 50 games on there I guess that would be a good value but it's just I wouldn't see myself using it a couple of the quick thoughts here from our chat room alpha-kin anagram seems to think that it's Pokemon that's distracting all our chatters tonight everybody's a busy catching their mudkips and they're little they're little balls that they run around with now because basically they took the walking trainer and incorporated that into a Pokemon game am I correct mm-hmm okay thank you I used to have the old it's like bringing back Tamagotchi I swear to God that thing looks like a Tamagotchi remember the old Pokemon Pikachu things that you just attached to your belt the pedometer thing that's what it is why no but remember the old ones well they do it would to compete with Tamagotchis essentially right like they're making all new again all you need to do is you download one of those free Xbox 360 massagers plug in the fucking controller into the duct tape that little Walker thing on there set it to vibrate at the new high setting to before you know it you'll be good to go all right I'll paint shaker but a couple other quick thoughts from our chat room on the on live Akuma JP says yes if it is cheaper I would like to play games for my net book net book is a good thought if it's a tune for net books net books could be gaming devices very interesting IK ripper says maybe most likely no there you go thoughts from our chat room chat dot orange on twitter.com speaking of moving and pedometers and all that shit EA Sports active 2.0 is announced and it's coming out for the Wii the ps3 and the iPhone oddly enough nothing said yet on the 360 I can't believe though with project at all on the horizon they aren't cooking something up for the 360 but my assumption is it's probably different probably much different anyhow EA Sports active they are getting a proper sequel not like a spin-off type thing like you've seen happen with the first set I think they had like more exercises or whatever but a proper sequel the console version of the game now they're gonna come with two motion sensors and a heart rate monitor you strap on your arm and leg interesting so it's gonna measure your heart rate now by the way you can share this information over social networks online so I'm assuming you're gonna be able to Facebook your EA active progress goody goody EA Vancouver is developing it one other thing I noticed it looks like almost like a little USB thing that you could like plug into your iPhone or something almost like a little dongle if you will for your iPhone or of course iPod touch with that so very interesting you want to know why it's not coming out on the 360 because 360 hasn't at all nope that's not why it's all right why 360 here's why one for the heart rate monitor for the Wii you've got your stupid vitality sensor that it will probably support to the Xbox 360 doesn't like Microsoft does not like licensing out their wireless technology for any peripheral really they've done it with you know the rock band guitars and the guitar hero guitars but that's about it the wireless technology it mostly everything has to be wired so I mean obviously since these devices are wireless you're not gonna be able to create some sort of wired device to plug in with you know the Xbox 360 a little USB shit could go in yeah but they don't do that kind of stuff that's why it's it's different they have certain specifications at the meet also play nice with each other I I still think you're I can't believe that you'll EA is a big big backer of 360 it's gonna be the tall that's the that's why all right anyhow I could be wrong but I'm probably not let's get into our classic game of the week is where I get into the end of part a believe it or not and we always like to end the first half of our show by taking a trip down memory lane where dark soccer is going to visit one of our classic video games from yesteryear the classic of the week dark Sakura what video game should all the boys and girls out there be enjoying this week the game of the week is grottiest to grottiest to and keep now I have to make a mention it is not the grottiest to that is that we got out as nemesis to for the nest this is grottiest to for the arcade and PC engine listen the music for a minute yes if you play Konami series of music games you heard this remix before that is where burning heat came from that's why when you're actually playing the music you shoot you know it shows the the sun's with the little snakes coming out of the you know the fire um grottiest to it was the gratitude to the ambition of gopher it was it came out in 1988 in Japan and it was the direct sequel to grottiest and the prequel to glad grottiest three of course there were versions that came out for the Famicom the PC engine in the x68 thousand and it is it has been we released the PC engine version and Famicom versions are out on the virtual console well not in North America until it came out in grottiest collection that came out in 2006 and then the international releases on the virtual console grottiest to came out in Europe in the arcades under the name of Vulcan venture so yes more fun with the Vic Viper and it did bring in some of the stuff that came from salamander or life force as when the other names and also I'm sorry but I think it's really important just basically reading chat it's really important to make this distinction people think life force is grottiest too because of the way these games were marketed to us as children is that a lot of us thought life force was a secret audience but they're actually two separate series in Japan there was salamander and it was grottiest we never got the actual grottiest too well not back in the NES days we got it later which I'm sure nemesis too was was like the life force grottiest and not guys life for salamander that's what that's a bit just a very common whoopsie because you know and again when I was a kid I thought life force with the sequel to grottiest because they look the same they felt the same but two different Japanese series that are just very similar well um one of the good things that came with this one is also the first one that had the boss rush they had levels with there were only boss confrontations so it's pretty cool so yeah you had you can pick your different weapon system so that as you picked up power-ups you can choose which of your different power-ups you could do like you could speed up you had options you had missile double laser the ripple sucks by the way it always has now when this came out on the Famicom it was one of the games that had a mapper chip to increase the graphics and sound a lot of games in Japan had that the Nintendo being big sticklers here in the US they actually had to have they a lot of you know games were a lot better overseas because they couldn't bring them out with anything other than the type the proprietary carts over here remember so there was the PC engine version in 1992 that came out as a super CD-ROM which I have a burn and one by the way one could argue that that's why this game never came out in the u.s. is because the specialized car and why Konami instead took the approach to kind of market life force as a sequel to Gradius basically this is one of the games that I'm looking for a legit one by the way it is just so awesome is so so if this has this is my favorite gradius game there's also they added an additional stage though for the PC engine version that came from the nest version of life force that was also the first stage of gradius 3 it also came out and for the gradius deluxe pack for PlayStation Saturn and Windows in 96 and then came out worldwide gradius collection for the PSP the of course the PC engine version was a Hanabi festival game in 2008 and of course there's always sweet spots at every boss battle that's right that one spot you got a hit to kill it fast and ripple does suck I agree alright there it is your classic game of the week gradius 2 that little clip coming to you from the PC engine but it's it was one reason to ever take the ripple lasers because the progression afterwards had didn't have double yeah double was in yeah I mean the one that came after ripple it was it was I think it was your other option mm-hmm I know there was always a reason to take the ripple route but you just always bypass ripple tiger glass a good question is a valid question for Jack just gradius to have vertical stages no no that was unique to the salamander series salamander that was part of what made that series unique yeah it was vertical stages good question though again all that all the marketing changes and stuff from Japan over here kind of screwed us up as a kid you know when Final Fantasy 7 came out who didn't ask where the hell was fourth through six I think I thought it was kind of cool they're like yeah we know I think by then a lot of people have figured it out but you know all right anyhow we're gonna take a break here at orange launch radio we got plenty more coming up some quick news when we come back about DJ hero and Tron yes and we'll see that trailer for the new Tron movie looks sweet but I got to say well actually no I take it back the movie is probably gonna be ridiculous but the score by Daft Punk sounds amazing just even based on that little trailer I saw gotta say very cool all right um let's see also news on XNA and Nintendo and another Hanabi festival coming up we're gonna get into all of that a little later on in part B of our show so don't go anywhere we'll be right back with more of orange lounge radio and welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio on this Sunday night March 14th of 2010 that's right pie day hope you're enjoying some pie we're not really having pie in studio which is a bit surprising I'm kind of full though I had fast food on the way over to the show driving back from San Francisco sadly I was I was in San Francisco but not a game developers conference but you know I'm not a game developer and you know you have to be one of the big media companies that's a magazine or whatever to get in there but that's okay although I think I would find the topics fascinating like you know I I kind of like the science of game development and stuff you know I understand that it's not really a media event that's what e3 is for so I'm not gonna be all butthurt I'm not going although I wish I I wish I could have crashed some of the sweet parties try the move stuff out but that's about it it's all gonna be at e3 in a couple months anyway yeah so I'm not you know too worried about it I mean of course I don't even know if I'm going to e3 this year I am definitely not going to do that out sorry to hear it it's just you know it's it's a strain to try to go you know each year anyways and I kind of I gotta take a day a year off I mean like last year remember we went it was kind of like yeah this is cool I feel like there's really more I want to see this year between the portal to the final has he 14 the move the Natal all this stuff you know or whatever Xbox ends up naming their thing I all that stuff I want to see this year so it seems like there's more to it in good time I don't know it's just I don't know all right well let's get into some rapid-fire news and then we're gonna get in some Twitter topics as well so you just have a few more minutes to get your Twitter topics and we have a few porn into the Twitter already at olr porn what pouring pouring I said it fast all right Loki start us off with some quick news tonight well Activision surprised us whoo they have new download content coming out to DJ hero unfortunately I don't give a flying fuck about it and this is really sad I mean unless you're a fan of you've been asking for it for for oh yes I've been asking for it I was hoping that they would I don't know put out some good download content and granted you know I guess if you like Eminem and jay-z you probably would have bought the renegade edition I didn't so I didn't and therefore I'm not buying this either but for the sake of reporting it I will tell you what three mixes they have in there shake that mixed with show me what you got without me mixed with encore and can I get a mix with lose yourself and I've I've watched the the video previews of these and let me just say I'm about as excited about these songs as I have been describing these songs to you it's seriously awful really what you're more of a trance guy anyway I mean and yeah that's fine but I even gave the last the extended mix pack whatever I gave that chance and I didn't really check up I downloaded the David Guada stuff but I did I like that I have not and maybe I'll go back to that but I like the other pack to the there was there was a what was it gorillas and something oh the the honor all of me and radio gaga yeah that's my favorite of the whole freaking gayest extended mix yeah and that's in the that download mix is and there I think gorilla song was in the other song in there but yeah I I have to me I realized Eminem jay-z they sell bazillions of albums but I'm just not I'm like I don't mind I know whatever not for me but I understand there's an audience for it I wouldn't mind those songs like if there's an Eminem song mix with like you know Queen or something like something different you know I'm like the stuff that was in the game I don't really care for to our you know rap R&B songs mixed together and the same time also it's just like really how long have I had to wait for another download pack I'm sorry but this is kind of like you know an insult to me it's just like yeah you know we're just gonna let you know that it's out there and I have DJ here on my Twitter you know they're on my Twitter and stuff and like you know putting these retweets for like stupid shit like artists going oh my god DJ here it's so cool it's like seriously you know when the fuck are you gonna download or add some more download content you support this stuff but then again we're talking Activision here so you really I've just got to wait for some sort of DJ game from harmonix or EA before I get that real download content because I sure as hell I'm not gonna get it with Activision so what about scratch the ultimate DJ yeah when's that coming out I haven't seen that yet well I think it's coming out around the time dude Newcomb forever is coming out and never anyways if you're interested in purchasing these they are available on March 18th for $8 or 640 Microsoft points and the tracks will not be sold separately so yeah however if you are on the Wii guess what you are in luck because you get them for a dollar more that's right there sold as single downloads for 300 300 we points and that's a total of $9 for each so guess what you get to pay the Wii Premium okay I'm done there now what is kind of neat is they're gonna be adding a new way to navigate PlayStation home apparently it's kind of take of the cross-media bar and the way they're doing it is they're gonna be able to go to different spaces like for example you can favorite different spaces you like going to you can go to you know personal spaces you know whatever it'll make a lot I forgot that came out this week it'll be a lot quicker to like kind of bounce from one place to another without having to walk aimlessly through and I do anything with the olr club yet which by the way is full I keep getting requests for the club and unfortunately I'm limited 25 members and I keep get like I seriously get new requests to join the club like every other day which I'm flattered and thank you all for wanting to join but unfortunately it's full so until Sony will let us have like I don't know 50 people 100 people all your apps are just sitting there waiting to be approved until like I'm not rejecting them I'm just not answering them it because I'm hoping that one day Sony's gonna say hey we're gonna make clubs useful and I can have 50 or 100 probably just they can't physically you know handle that many people in one space at a time or in that close that's a bunch of ball because if you go to the main space area you can see more than 25 people there at a time no offense I just yeah but if that's Sony's line I claim bullshit yeah but how many servers are running that one space or I don't know whatever they're just not doing it but you know what I'm not going on home either so I this doesn't mean anything to me as well yeah I wonder if there's gonna be a theme going on here but let's find out this is kind of neat apparently people think that you're gonna have the power of the ps3 in your pocket within three years the group imagination technologies maker of the power of VR chips says that I guess powers like you know smartphones like iPhones the Droid and whatnot they said that they you'll have graphics comparable to ps3 in three years and the reason is because they're designing the chips right now for that kind of stuff apparently they're working with different new groups to license things you know you know like Apple HTC whatnot they're saying that in three years imagination says you're gonna have a ps3 in your pocket and it's not gonna be running at 40 by 340 resolution that most smartphones have now but it's actually gonna be like a 720p output via HDMI to a TV that would be something that phone that outputs to a TV via HDMI interesting and yeah they go into a lot more detail of course on different technologies are out there and stuff but you can only imagine though that as you know time goes on I mean the technology is just growing you know and at you know geometric rate that of course I can imagine you know I was actually having that kind of technology soon within like next five years well yeah that seems a little aggressive seeing as if you go by the whole like Nintendo is is one off from the you know consoles with their handhelds meaning that the DS is kind of like a 64 just like the advance was kind of like a super Nintendo then the next handheld for Nintendo will be kind of like a GameCube funny that you mentioned that actually oh oh I have something they'll be for last-minute stories for that I can cover it now if you why not yes please please don't make me wait any longer I need to know I need to know I'm dying apparently there's a rumor about ds2 of course there's always a rumor about you there's always some damn remember um according to somebody sources within GDC I'm not gonna read through the article to see who exactly is quoting here that it's in the developers hands and apparently they're not having trouble developing for it because it's basically a GameCube power wise and everyone knows how to develop for a GameCube because they've been doing it for quite a while with both well because the Wii is a GameCube too basically yes the little the thing is you know it's gonna be interesting this is apparently the people are familiar with the dev kit made it sound like there wasn't much learning curve on the new system and that devs who worked on GameCube or Wii games will find it easy to create with also they said that apparently the system has a built-in accelerometer and two big higher resolution screens that are closer together so that they can more easily be used as one screen and I guess the biggest bit of news however is that the devs say that they'll be done with their games by the end of 2010 meaning that we may see an announcement at e3 well it's kind of something we've been thinking for a while it's gonna happen yeah despite the DS IX L I told you if they could do the micro so close to the DS they can do the XL and have ds2 out 83 despite all their responses to the cause you know I like the idea of bringing the two screens closer together to make one big screen I think that's kind of cool yeah I wonder if they're both be tons of touch sensitive this time right yeah why not and by the way just pro tip Nintendo if it's gonna run on like GameCube II type hardware f0 ok thanks all right and just because it runs on GameCube type hardware does not mean that I want to see fucking ports of every single GameCube game that you guys put out okay do some new shit seriously well at least unless it's Wind Waker Wind Waker I will accept the rest of them except every time zero I reject them all all right and for the gods sake please you know maybe add some more buttons to the face like an analog stick or something like that so that we can actually play games in traditional sense seven these like remember remember they used to have that like thumb stylus thing that you would have to strap to your finger they came with yes yes I do what were yeah I know that you could use that in the mario 64 game to kind of control it uh-huh yeah it didn't didn't really work yeah all right anyhow let's go a little old-school let's go very old-school Donkey Kong of course there's a whole movie made out of the Battle of the Donkey Kong high scores the King of Kong remember that it was Billy Mitchell Steve Weeby Ryan and good versus evil or whatever you however you want to look at it well guess what the whole movie has just been made irrelevant because there is a new king in town and it's neither it's a new guy who Hank Chien is his name he's a plastic surgeon from New York he has beaten Billy Mitchell's record Billy Mitchell by the way had one million fifty thousand two hundred points built our Hank sorry Hank has scored one million sixty one thousand seven hundred points officially verified by twin galaxies an original Donkey Kong cabinet machine in New York is how he said it congrats to him now he can star in the sequel after a leading his high score he was heard quoted saying suck it bitch yeah a tape has just arrived at twin galaxies from Billy Mitchell believe it or not or who was it that was saying that like the the other person's high score was like false or something like that like there was one of the two guys that were complaining people get really into I don't know I didn't watch the you know when I watched the movie I was just like damn people really get into this shit but then I'm like oh I host a podcast on the internet about video games like well I want to hold the high score for something really stupid that you know I want to be all pompous hey I remember when we went to classic gaming Expo one year and they were doing like the official twin galaxies high score for I think it was stampede on the 2,600 that I played stampede dude I think I was like last place for the day I was so fucking terrible at stampede but the guy was trying to give me tips and stuff and what he was saying made a lot of sense but I was just like wow when I was a kid I didn't think about these games like that like the tips and everything he was trying to give me like I was just like I just tried to lasso the horse thingies anyhow hey Tron something else from my childhood of course Tron legacy that trailer hit the internet this week and I gotta say although I my expectation bar for Tron like legacy is very very low because Tron wasn't really a good movie per se it was just as an awesome movies what it was one of those things that you just you like it better because you're a kid and you know just the technology it's cool it's cool cycles it's not so much good it's just cool so Tron legacies coming out I gotta say despite the fact that the expectation bar for the movies are very low you know I'm gonna be seeing it opening day okay you know I'm gonna go just like many of you the score by Daft Punk sounds awesome like what's a word that's better than awesome more awesome awesomer super off more awesomer than a lot of game soundtracks out there well anyhow there's another track tie into Tron legacy going on it's called arcade aid apparently if you actually go into the Flynn lives website you can get this this picture that references I guess they say 56 different arcade games old-school arcade games like I see burger time like there's a little burger with a clock so that's one of the oops I gave one away sorry but I totally dig the space paranoid signs still on the building it's very similar to like I've seen something similar in Rolling Stone that like had all these different band names as a picture like somebody smashing a pumpkin there get it all these things like that I already did all these like for example Goldeneye Star Fox Sea Wolf I see Kongo Bongo there at the bottom no that's actually Donkey Konga Frogger because it's a donkey and classic game I know shadow Colossus Frogger outrun because it's an outrunning huh funny spoil everything geez well that's what I do that one right there is Bertie King it's a golf game time splitters bomber made sheet it off a website in you know I actually figured thank you can thank me putting together my main cabinet for being aware of all these different because a lot of the stuff I have themes for my hyper spin stuff so you know the names became familiar I actually did you can ask my co-worker because I sat there for the first hour that day that it came out during the day and just working on that SSJ 100 as she 100 Matt says it was a good B movie Tron that is that's a good way of just finding it I like Tron for the same reason I like showgirls it's so bad you are a horror darlin I love Tron actually good movie to me end of line have you seen the game trailer for Tron legacy I have doesn't it remind you of force unleashed hmm I wasn't thinking of it that way but yeah I just I love the old-school Tron arcade game and that was awesome but of course it's one of those things that's better left in my memory because I played on an Xbox Live I was kind of like yeah well in Tron and disc of Tron are actually the bottom of that page to they really yeah all right anyhow act F'd also says it was Empire magazine that did that collage I'm thinking of it's probably been done a couple times I want to say there's a movie one out there too yeah anyhow who cares about all of this news I'll tell you what the biggest news of the week is this is this is gigantic news this is epic news this is I don't I can't believe it in lead the show off with this news tonight lady gaga is coming to rock band yes that's right lady gaga will be coming on to rock band with a four pack of songs including just dance bad romance poker face and monster but that's not all there is a bonus fifth song you're gonna be able to get you're gonna be able to get the Eric Cartman version of poker face the only reason to get it and the best part about it is he's playing the song in rock band in the show and living rooms across America I will be buying all these tracks I'll be buying all every single one of them because I am such a huge Dan for lady gaga it's not even funny hey you even told me you like bad romance that's one of the four songs I know but I don't know that I like it enough to buy it on rock band I'll stick with rush thank you fair enough hey rush is cool I can't deny that it's just lady gaga is just like I said before more awesomer all right seriously though how about some other last-minute stories Dark Sakura last minute I'm sorry not last minute say quick whatever too many segments on this damn show just just read a story I don't care what it is just read something once upon a time what it out of her box actually I do have to I do have to say the poop situation is over oh did you find out what happened an update on Shermey's bowel movements she's just an old lady she can't she couldn't get in her cat box it was too deep mm-hmm we got her shallower one changed her litter she's happy does she need caddy to kitty depends or anything no I'm not putting cat diapers on her all right no kitty and sure in her all right I did buy her cat grass and she's happy all right for anybody that was wondering thank you everyone who now you don't turned over my cat's poop so you remember the game hotel dusk also I haven't talked about the tester on this show in a few weeks which I have what I've watched every episode last week you did talk about oh never mind then okay okay finish I just okay yes you can remember hotel desk yes the company that made it sing is a to over 200 million in debt they also did another code they did town factory for little king story and last window yeah we better buy some more of their copies of again which is coming out at the end of this month because that was also by the them I think they filed for bankruptcy on March 1st 200 million yen so we need to sell 200 million copies of that game I know you can do it um the final new character for Street Fighter 4 has been released and it's a big red dude covered in oil wearing what looks like a hat made out of Legos on his head and he's a grappler and he slides and he's a splashing oil everywhere this is actually kind of sploogeworthy so I I gotta give props to Alan he recognized what they were referencing he's a Turkish oil wrestler it's this big thing in in other countries like of Turkey where they douse themselves in what appears to be ky jelly type of substance and wrestle each other it is pretty homorific but no homo I've I've heard of it it's just the the screen captures like dude you're red Greco Roman normally what's that isn't that like Greco Roman oh I don't know he told me it was he told me to google image search Turkish oil wrestling and let's just say I got a lot of guys who didn't look quite as bad as that guy okay not wearing a blue Lego hat also is it Mullen you yeah well I know whatever um anyway the guy who makes fable yeah really but basically saying that comparing natal and move he said well move is a good step in the right direction but it's not as big as natal and he's not biased or anything well says first-party developer for Microsoft saying that that move is going to be more for the casual market and natal is going to be more for the immersive gamer so fable 3 will blow your mind except it won't to be exactly like the last two games but he'll claim that it like blows your mind it blows you I I'm interested to see what what the natal Lincoln is but they do say on that natal is not mandatory for fable 3 which I also like I will allow you to slap a bitch Oh Loki what we do without you here at orange lounge radio we would die that's what would happen we would die how about some Twitter topics speaking of death no actually we have some good questions tonight we have some really good questions on the Twitter twitter.com slash olr I'm going to allow usually I don't allow more than one question a person but M and Ziba has a couple good ones tonight so I will I will grant an exception M and Ziba asking what is the deal with the chocobo what is the deal with the chocobo in Final Fantasy 13 is there a use for it or is it just there to look cute and to make it a Final Fantasy game I think it's a little bit the second part it is there to look cute and make it a little more of a Final Fantasy game because since there is no like world map type thing they had to incorporate a chocobo I think another way one big bitch about the game by the way is that there's no Final Fantasy victory music you never hear doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo you never hear that but there at least there's a chocobo um I will say this though they do treat the chocobo as a character and I think that's what makes this a little bit unique compared to the other Final Fantasy games like you know if you go into the bio cards you know when you're looking into data log which is like a memory bank section of the game so you can read what's going on all the characters have their little profiles with the data log the chocobo has his own entry so I don't know if maybe the chocobo becomes more relevant later in the story but he's awfully cute I want a fat chocobo to hold your items yeah it's all my items it'd be awesome if he has a playable character later on all right and M&Z but since I'm allowing the second tweet tonight says this should be the game for the sweet off the Swedish Armed Forces the team test remember we were talking about the sweet off with one of our callers last week well there's this I've never even heard of this we just got a link here to the Swedish Armed Forces team test and I guess it's some type of like online little ranking thing I'll have to look into this and see if it's appropriate for the sweet off but I don't know like part of me is like the sweet off should happen with like president cat or beat mania 2dx or something a little more showish or olr match game I think I think we have to do all our match game for the sweet off I think that's that's just mandatory but I appreciate the suggestion don't get me wrong tiger claw links us I'm sorry it's actually tiger call 305 on Twitter links us to a story on one up about ensemble and pandemic talking about their company closures they're actually taking responsibility and blaming themselves according to the one-up article Paul Bettner he was an employee of ensemble studios for 12 years of course it was shut down by Microsoft in 2008 he blamed their own internal crunch culture saying quote the reality is that every single game we shipped took twice as long as we said it was going to take and cost twice as much to make Microsoft as a public company they answer to their shareholders and we were simply too expensive kind of an interesting little article kind of um interesting to hear folks taking responsibility for what happened but still kind of a it's a rarity nowadays it is a rarity nowadays but still kind of a bummer by the way when the show is bad it's never my fault always Loki's that means it's never my fault either it's rarely notice it's sometimes but all right Nico Nico Chan links us to a website I think this might be a I think this might be a website plug I don't know but I'll read it Pokemon ro dotnet what do you think about it it's like red blue made from Ragnarok online system and skills but with a ton of customs Jamie apparently knows it yes and we'll play we'll play we'll play a plus plus we'll play again they're there right now right now I hardly have time to play anything but this I will when I when my brain works and I have time gonna make some time gonna make some time in between killing the Klingons and Gorn spazzinator PSN says okay since it's pie day here's a random question pizza or pasta Boston cream see I get what he's doing there because they call it pizza they don't really call it pizza pie here at least I never hear that term but yeah I think it's less deep dish here yeah I do love Boston cream pies but it's like I'll still always have pumpkins so I've got to go for pizza like if you're asking me one pie versus all of pizza those more of a cake I mean really it's it's it's a cake with a cream layer in it but you still elect Boston cream over pizza no I really love Boston cream pie I had it for breakfast last week let's say let's see Ryan Belknap is wishing us a happy pie day but he's also trying to imitate a spammer I see what you're doing there he's a Twitter folks it's SSJ 100 Matt on Twitter but his Twitter name is Matt Ostrovsky which I always mispronounce dr. love himself Gene Simmons will be voicing Guitar Hero 6 could it be Guitar Hero kiss awesome how this missed the show world tonight but I remember reading about this apparently Gene Simmons has said he's doing Guitar Hero but Gene Simmons also one of those guys that I get the feeling might batter off about something what he really doesn't know what he's talking about so like he might be saying he's doing Guitar Hero six but I totally see like maybe there's a kiss Guitar Hero game in the works it's not actually I could see him being the voice of Guitar Hero just because he said he's the voice of Guitar Hero but here's the thing is he's also the voice of I need to get paid because you know we're not putting out any new albums and we are doing touring sometimes but you know what he's been on Celebrity Apprentice he's had his own reality show he's you know he's horned himself out okay that's really what it comes down to and and he was on the Celebrity Apprentice for heaven's sakes I mean that's that's where celebrities go and because they need attention and you know what cool he can be in the next Guitar Hero game just don't be pissed off if he's singing Kelly Clarkson can't wait can't wait for the youtubes of Gene Simmons singing Taylor Swift you belong to me anyhow uh that was my Taylor Swift impression by the way or Lady Gaga or something can't wait the full in the full makeup you belong to me yes Taylor Swift sings like a muppet um lastly on the OLR Twitter brick tone asks us and I this is kind of a fragmented question apparently he was challenged with 140 characters support for ps3 crash question mark well I don't support the ps3 crash but you know mistakes happen I put it kind of on the same level as the Red Ring of Death it's unnecessary Ubisoft online PC copy protection and what do you think of the wiimote for ps3 well we talked about the PC thing a little earlier and go listen to last week's show this way I wish the Red Ring of Death was exactly like the PlayStation Network fail or the ps3 failures because if the Red Ring of Death would just go away after a day I wouldn't be complaining as much of it oh well that's an inconvenience but I'll just wait 24 hours and it'll be all better no that's not the case it happens to all the consoles that's true I don't go after a day I would rather have the 24 hour shutdown than the you know permanent shutdown and lastly what do you think of the wiimote for ps3 well again I think we talked about that a little bit earlier in the show I think it's a necessary step for Sony but it's an unnecessary peripheral for me to buy right now that's where I'm at until I see that must-have game I'm not sold and I don't know what that must-have game is but it's not like Sony can't create a new IP because like little big planet hello that is like a system seller ps3 game is that good you know uncharted is that good speaking of little big plant you did you see the video of like how exactly the PlayStation move works in I'm gonna be honest no I just heard it is compatible did it look good no it's basically you know how in Super Mario Galaxy the other players control like a curse or whatever and they could shoot shit no this one you basically control a cursor and you can move shit well yeah it might add another element to level design and I'm all for it you know again where I give major major props to media molecule and Sony is that they're not milking little big planet for a two and three and four they keep making the first game better and making it so much more of a value so it's hard to be mad yeah you know what it's another feature it's just one I probably I'd like to think of it as a continuous of all continuously evolving experience God I wish games were like and you know what I think that they could do a little big planet too but just release as a download pack look new levels that do you think maybe just ModNation racers will probably have it too at some point just wasn't ready to show yet like gripping the steering wheel wheel with your you know not wiimote you know I'm sure it's an inevitable thanks for the tweets guys twitter.com slash olr give us a follow we really appreciate it and by the way I also wanted to say this at some point in the show tonight we really do appreciate five-star reviews on iTunes and people that help spread the word because you know we do say at the end of every show you know tell a friend or two about the show and help spread the word about orange launch radio that's really all we ask to continue doing this show for you guys and I just want to say there were a couple of really really nice reviews left on iTunes this week I wanted to read them because they were very very nice and with last week's show even with last week's show these were both left in the past week for a short and sweet one from Bert 777 saying I love it been listening for a while anybody into video games give these awesome people a chance so thank you Bert hope Ernie's doing well and but I want to read this one this is just sweet this this gave me the awe feeling and and really makes doing the show worthwhile shadow seven seven says I've been listening to OLR for at least three years and over time they went from being a good podcast to an epic podcast they are opinionated and well-informed on video game matters and to top it off for really funny over time they have honed their broadcasting skills and their radio voices and have become a podcast that I would actually pay money to hear they do go off on tangents quite often though choo-choo this is a plus to me but always managed to wrap something up about video games into the subject they are always current about the video game industry and run the gamut on topics from reviews to previews to info on various video game developers and publishers to things random to describe the live show is something new experience and they actually pay attention to the chat room and take calls the community is also fairly active so I just want to say thank you because you know people take the time out to write these nice reviews and I realize yeah it's a little bit of ego stroking and so forth but I actually read that it made me go oh that's really nice like somebody didn't have to say all that and they did and I just wanted to share the the odds so thank you very much again those are five-star reviews from iTunes and of course you know all we ask I realize not everybody's on the Apple bandwagon like if I asked Loki to leave a five-star review on iTunes he told me to play hide and go fuck myself from last week's show so it just tell friends about the show that's all we I don't go on iTunes I know you don't you know that's against you can rate them on zoom to just you know all right anyhow let's move on some actual video gaming news let's get past the ego stroking and get to some more video game news because there's plenty of it still to go more stuff coming out from you know this week there's actually some information you know we talked a little about in the tall and whatnot but can't forget about XNA XNA game studio 4.0 apparently is including support for Windows phones and they're even going to be including some new features including gamer tags avatar support and achievements you can unlock on your phone that's right there's going to be games that you can use for unlocking achievements kind of like an Xbox Live arcade game in fact you can unlock up to 200 Microsoft or gamerscore points and I guess it's going to be displayed on your Xbox Live gamer tag profile like the games for Windows stuff because there was that one game tinker was it called that you can only get on the windows thing it was like the free game that came with the games for Windows client and you could play that game I reviewed it about a month ago I think it was called tinker and it would show up in your profile just like any older the game and it had its own set of achievement points so it's kind of like that but now on your cell phone yeah and it's kind of neat I think that's a cool idea you know for you know how Apple should have done it achievement whores they well you know sometimes achievements like that it gets people to buy the game well there's a whole study out of GDC again it's not on the show tonight but there's a whole thing on achievements and it does motivate people to play games and there's a percentage of people it's a small percentage but a percentage that really try to go after every single achievement in a game you know and and we'll buy games with a chief didn't they say to that games with really easy achievements especially in arcade will sell a little more times me so hey why not if it's a way to draw attention to the windows phone anything to pull the eyes away from Apple for a minute I I think is a good idea mm-hmm all right with this would this get you on board with a windows phone though Loki since I know you're not gonna get an iPhone no because the data plans on phones are too expensive and it's just you know if they brought down if it was like 50 bucks a month for unlimited data and everything then maybe because that's what I kind of pay for my phone right now but even then I don't use that many minutes right now and I'm actually thinking about going to a prepaid phones where I don't have to you know like 100 bucks a year type stuff you know we're literally I'm lucky if I use six to twelve minutes a month well somebody is teasing me yet again with the idea of a new Kid Icarus game remember about a year or two ago where we were convinced this was coming out at e3 we had the screenshots and everything and it just didn't fucking happen how sad well again we get teased and you can kind of thank Kotaku for that but really it was because they were interviewing Yoshio Sakamoto who of course was one of the creators of Kid Icarus I guess they cornered him at GDC or something and basically he said in a nutshell that you know they're not opposed to bringing out Kid Icarus to the Wii they just don't know what to do here's the quote quote I don't know personally about any project underway regarding Kid Icarus but if so many of these people are interested in it and really want to see it on the Wii they should really speak up are they deaf because I think like a lot of people have been like speaking up for a while but okay whatever well are we do we need to do a petition online is that what needs to happen good gosh I'm sure there's plenty already again moving on with a quote quote if we can find some sort of way to bring it to the Wii a way to make the game for the Wii that makes sense we would happily do so but just keep in mind it may not be me making the game so in other words he's admitting it might be somebody else just like how Metroid other M is is in somebody else's hands and so forth honestly I think if they want to do a Kid Icarus game on the Wii why not just do like a souped up version Allah even though even I hate to say it because I received this game so tepidly but maybe the blaster master game just a little more polished or the just like the Mario new Super Mario Brothers Wii you don't have to like totally reinvent Kid Icarus just you know make it a fancy looking 2d game with some new features that's all you really need to do I think but all right I just hate the idea that's getting teased on that again because I would really love to see a Kid Icarus but again I want to see him do it right I don't want to see him just slap something with the character his name on it and it sucks so I rather they just don't touch it at all and I'm sure a lot of you guys feel the same way anyhow dark soccer what you got I want the most epic Kid Icarus ever I do too I you know and especially you would think with God of War which is another Greek mythology thing doing very well on another platform you think Nintendo would would already have some ideas on how you can make the Greek mythology thing successful I know how about Battle of Olympus anyone well how about something else though that is kind of a big ish okay Hanabi festival yay but Nintendo raised some prices for some of their games ironclad is now a thousand we points instead of 900 and loadrunner is 600 instead of 500 there's military madness for we wear which will be a thousand we points and then the rest is DSI where pop island simply mahjong simply sudoku each of those will be 200 DSI points and then four travelers play Spanish which is a multiplayer game that teaches you Spanish and elementary masters being a fantasy card adventure both are 800 DSI points so they got a lot of the big stuff out last year but of course Rondo of blood is kind of the big one that everybody's like that means I don't have to worry about accidentally scratching my desk I wonder if that means it's gonna come out here too oh I know you're reading it for Europe and what they get but they sometimes get cooler stuff than we do so I hope it means we're gonna get it around the same time want it might be dark sakura it could be tomorrow it could be tomorrow I know I know I want next week to be here already not just because of packs not not this coming week but the week after not just because the PAX East but Microsoft Game Room I've seen some of the clips from my GDC for Microsoft Game Room looks looks kind of cool I'm excited to try here's my question though about that hobby festival those just because you guys are getting all excited and everything one of the years they did bring that stuff over here but not last year I don't think it was only in Europe well it seems like they don't bring all the games over here cuz well no I guess they did do a festival out of it because I want to say they brought sin and punishment over here which was a big deal because they in the back of their minds they knew the sequel was coming we didn't know that yet but they knew it was so they brought that out yeah I think marbles too did also like yeah I think you're right the original Mario 2 you're right yeah was part of that crap well maybe they'll do it again here but not gonna hold my breath either so we'll see a couple more stories for you guys then we're gonna get to the mailbag mailbag at orange lounge radio.com well this is kind of an interesting tie-in but apparently mafia 2 will feature vintage playboys that's right 2k games has announced that they've signed a license agreement with the Playboy magazine for I guess they're gonna have 50 of the vintage covers and centerfolds inside the game when it's released so I guess you'll see vintage playboys littered on the ground and stuff like that also I guess you know the Playboy collectibles won't show up I guess until the later part of the game because I guess the game takes place during the 40s and 50s and apparently the magazine won't I guess merely be like a window dressing they're saying but I actually have the ability to collect virtual copies of the magazine so that's a Pokemon game worth playing so I guess you know like in the Grand Theft Auto games where you have hidden packages or in you know Grand Theft Auto 4 birds you have to kill this game you will have dirty magazines that you collect nice and they're that are they actual Playboy vintage covers that's gonna be the actual covers Wow so they're gonna I don't know if they have it says they have the centerfolds as well so I don't know if you get the cover in the centerfold it's a little bit of nudity for you but uh neat hey adding some tits to your game always makes it sell a few more copies so there you go and I do believe that they had a character from mafia 2 in the last digital fake game chick oh they still do that huh yeah these girls and it's retarded yeah a little silly all right on the PSP maybe this system can render some nice-looking titties I don't know that should be the question we ask about a new engine you know how we always say with a new peripheral what's the time to penis with new game engines we should always ask what's the time for realistic boobs I don't know anyhow I think this system is very capable of doing it it's the fire engine that's phyre engine right now this is a tool that's used for creating ps3 games it was used to make critter crunch flower shatter well apparently now this is going to be compatible with the PSP big announcement a game developers conference which makes sense because the people developing games want to know that they can make games like critter crunch on the PSP I gotta say flower awesome-looking game that is one of the most beautiful games you will play on a next-gen system period critter crunch looks like a freaking cartoon really well done so it's kind of exciting to hear that this phyre engine is coming to the PSP one of the VPS technology taji you kata or sorry you taka said phyre engine for PSP was developed in response to requests from the game developer community and we hope that the release of the PSP version demonstrates our commitment and support for game developers on all platforms begin counting down the time until critter crunch and flower are announced on the PSP because I'll bet you anything both of those games being as well received as they were getting PSP ports in a matter of three two one yeah wait for e3 anyhow now is the part of the show where dark soccer is gonna take an adventure into the mailbag she's gonna jump in pull out some emails and read them for you here the mailbag mailbag at orange lounge radio.com dark soccer who's emailing us this week two from Rob above this is now that the following terms are allowed in Xbox Live gamer tags lesbian gay bi transgender straight I think that Microsoft has the golden opportunity for avatar clothing and props of the LGBT it's not an official 2010 prediction but I'm pretty sure they will any takers or am I taking too much for granted in other news did you hear about Washington DC has made gay marriage legal next thing you know some guy will try to marry his virtual girlfriend oh wait yes I I did hear about DC making it legal so congratulations DC and I may I made a mistake because I tweeted about it when it happens and I was like what state's gonna be next come on guys it's time to get the other states on board and then I realized like literally five seconds after hitting submit I was like oh DC is not a state but still it's it's an important part of the nation obviously and very glad to hear that they have stopped marriage discrimination yep good for them as far as the other part of that the the part related to gaming more about how long before I can get a rainbow sticker a rainbow belt for my character I don't know I think a lot of it is about supply and demand and I don't know if there's just a huge demand for that I don't think that Microsoft's gonna be really trying to sell that anytime soon I don't know I think it would be a little while I just don't think there's enough out there in the avatar marketplace where they need that stuff right now I mean yeah they have sports jerseys but you know I don't know I don't then again they had the politically motivated icons a couple years ago when the oh eight election happened I want to say they had their own little like Xbox poll because there were Obama icons and McCain icons right am I crazy when there's some type of like unscientific poll they did like yeah I don't know I don't know if they'd want to do such a social issue on the marketplace I don't realistically see that happening well now also from the Disney parks log the monorails are going to feature Tron legacy art okay that's pretty cool nice like all the Disney parks are gonna be Tron Trana time trying to tie looking at the Disney parks it's the it's Disney world oh wow that's so cool you see the monorails at Disneyland like just got redone not that long ago so I'm but I can't believe tell me this picture is not sweet oh that's right oh it's just like a little paint job on the outside yeah pretty cool though um yes me you know what I mean even cooler if they did we know be boy no but seriously though speaking of Tron in Disneyland because I can bring this back on point the coolest fucking ride I remember from when I was a kid the people mover featuring Tron it was you know they had the people mover which I had for years and years but in the early 80s when the movie came out there was a section of it that was the super speed tunnel where basically they projected imageries of Tron really fast on the wall so if it was a visual trick it was an optical illusion that made you feel like you were going like 60 miles an hour in this tunnel because it was like the light cycles going by real quick like bring that back Disneyland the fucking tracks are still sitting there not being used how awesome would it be if this Christmas you open it up for Tron problem is the people mover someone fell off of it and died then they their own damn fault and then they I understand yes and I totally agree with you it is their own damn fault that they fell out of the stupid thing and died then there was the rocket rods which were really super fast still had the Tron tunnel but it was like zoom through the Tron tunnel it is hard to see anything I never rode rocket rods sadly but someone also somehow managed to fall out of that thing and died so people are dumb that's what it comes down to that's why they all the gondolas anymore because someone fell out of it and died it's always people acting like jackasses falling out of things and dying the chat room has a request for me real quick here honors like a genuine bona fide electrified six-car monorail what I say monorail what's it called that's right monorail I hear those things are awfully loud it lies as softly as a cloud is there a chance the truck could bend not on your life my Hindu friend what about a spring that slobs you'll be given cushy jobs where you sent here by the devil no good sir I'm on the level the ring came off my pudding can take my penknife my good man I swear it's Springfield's only choice throw up your hands and raise your voice but main streets the wall cracked and broken sorry mom the mob is spoken Phil Hartman was a great man he's missed all right anyhow sorry for the tangent yes hopefully they involve monorails good morning orange house radio this is Jesus writing in again I have quite a few things to cover today so first I'd like to thank dark soccer for reading my previous selling email in this one as well I really appreciate it I am also sorry for any spelling errors or grammatical faults in my letters which there are undoubtedly many yeah but you're forgiven now on to more pressing matters okay ripper is the Swede I should be the other Swede since I am still just a private in the ol army oh don't give up like that come on where's my epic battle where's my sweet throw down okay fine a lot of respect goes out to a key ripper his ability to call in so often I'm still quite impressed he manages to stay up for so long every week anyways time for something that actually relates to gaming as we all know the world is in a state of economic turmoil hundreds and thousands of developers are being fired studios are getting shut down and the debate of piracy and DRM is getting more attention around the globe as we've heard on the last few shows but how is this impact impacting the gaming world on a larger scale I'll tell you how more sequels than ever are being pumped out in fear of bankruptcy and less money is being invested in creating new intellectual properties the reasoning is very simple and is often employed in the movie business using a successful brand name or franchise that is already well known will cost the publisher a lot less money to build up interest and then having to actually produce several ads and build a hype behind a new setting and new characters successful games usually have an amount of blind followers who will buy the next game in a series if the previous game was good which in turn means almost guaranteed turnover of all investments and profits for the publisher to prove my point I want each OLR member to try and think of the game that is near release that is based on a new IP now that might not have been too hard since you have had the new releases segments before mailbag but my point is that a large percentage of new games have to have a two or three in the name when will we get the next portal or Bioshock type of game that comes along and really blows people's minds one portal to talk to I know right what made both of those games so amazing was that there was no expectation of what the games would be about the storytelling and both these were innovated the protagonist intriguing in the setting unique which really made for a game experience like no other with this in mind isn't it sad that there is a Bioshock 2 already out in that portal 2 is on its way how we really reached solo that any new franchise gets 80 or more Metacritic score gets placed on the sequel bandwagon is this really what us gamers want I will have to say I am excited about portal 2 I guess I'm just point though yeah well I know I get the point but I do want more portal goodness I think though that some of us are just like we have such awesome experiences with some of these games that we want more it's a matter of whether they need to make the sequel or not like some sequels are actually pretty good and some sequels are just kind of we put it out because we want more money I have been hearing the most friendly feedback regarding Bioshock 2 that a lot of folks are complaining it does feel like a cash cow at the first game Bioshock was great but there have been some really good original game a little big plan I was talking about earlier Bayonetta Bayonetta was really well or the original Mass Effect I'm saying for sequels though oh but I mean even original IPs there's been a lot of really good ones in the past year blur looks like it's gonna be great you know there there's some second to to finish email out I guess I'm just ranting at this point so I will ask another question regarding new IPs when do you think Blizzard will release a game with a new IP soon I think they're working on one right now I think I I don't know maybe I'm putting the cart before a horse a little bit but I remember there were some rumors a while back that they were working on a new IP because they had Diablo Starcraft World of Warcraft and then another one I think once you see the spacecraft I think once you see the dust settle with Star Trek Star Trek Starcraft and the World of Warcraft cataclysm and you know Diablo 3 is kind of their focus I think you'll start to get some rumblings of what they're doing next and I my gut tells me it's gonna be an MMO and I'll go so far to say it's an MMO but not like a Warcraft MMO like something kind of different like a tabula rasa MMO you know how tabula rasa was like a shooter like I think they're gonna go a different route with the MMO why make a copy of Warcraft when they have Warcraft I think they're gonna go with an MMO that's different and that makes sense well um okay looking forward to to the show and your response is Jesus PS I will most likely be listening live to the next olr the one on March 21st call us yeah we need maybe we should have our match came off that week I don't know we'll see we maybe I could plan a match game oh you're not gonna be here next no I'll be here I'll be late oh you'll be late okay I'm gonna go to a Seder okay so well then what time do you get back from those about seven eight maybe earlier all right cool then we should be able to do a match game in part B yeah hello olr okay here's the deal about a month ago I wrote in about Silent Hill shattered memories in Dark Sakura the kind living woman she is I know told me flat-out to play one of the originals now I'm getting to my point here I bought Silent Hill 2 just a couple of days ago but I could have gotten a Silent Hill for the room so I was wondering did I pass up a great game for a load of crap are they both equally good and should I just shut the hell up now um they're different kinds of good Silent Hill 4 is a very different kind of game sorry what was the other game I heard the room it got Silent Hill 2 but passed up Silent Hill 4 to get it I think you made the good choice I think yeah if you haven't played either I think you made the better choice with two I think two is the one that's very iconic of the series although a lot of folks are partial to three and the original as well I personally am partial to three and I still say play two first between the yeah I mean four is not bad by any means I think it got raised a little bit by critics too harsh I think it's better than that but I think also it's a little obvious that four was intended to be a different game in the beginning yeah it because as far as how they're related three is more of a sequel to one and four follow some of the story points from two well four was just gonna be the room yeah it was a new horror franchise they were doing called the room and they ended up you know it's kind of Silent Hill ish so let's make it Silent Hill but it worked it really did work it did it it was a good game I a horrible horribly underrated by the community at home the part with big head good oh my god I screamed like a little girl when I played that I think Logie was there and I felt I remember falling down and there were these big monster two-headed baby things in the well water prison or whatever and I screamed like a girl look he's what the hell are you doing like I'm playing Silent Hill and it's Gary um okay so yeah they're both equally good but you did a good thing by buying Silent Hill 2 on another note my friend brought up a good point today about Max Payne 3 which brings me to another question do you guys know whether or not they're going to bring back the comic panels for cutscenes are we all fucked for that well I think I don't know yeah a little little early to tell honestly but hey you could always have the digital comics on PSP you never know they may make a comic out of it specifically for a PSP it would certainly lend itself well to that well I thank you for reading my email and if you didn't why the fuck not your loyal listener I'll just say I'm not gonna do your whole name Haseo from northern Minnesota the land of the oh my god it's so fucking windy I'm sorry muddy sorry I like listeners to get a little bit of attitude with us and if you didn't read this email why the fuck no I like emails to get a little sassy with us oh we got another did he text us really quick yeah okay okay one more message is there a way to get memory from a ps2 I guess memory card to a ps1 I can't because those are a bitch to find without going online to PSP and onto a ps3 without the memory card adapter onto a ps3 no I think you need the adapter if you're going from ps1 to ps2 a ps2 will read the cards from one and you can even put that data on a ps2 card but only ask like a carrier you can't put a ps2 card in a ps1 under any reason so the only thing you could do you could put a ps1 card in a ps2 but unfortunately I ain't gonna do you a lick of good without the the transmitter cable unfortunately that's just the way it is oopsies if you I you might be able to I don't know if this will work you might have to do some research on this you might be able to get something that lets you put your ps1 data on the PC and then you could use a USB stick to do it that I think is possible but I can't remember yeah but saves on the PC had different formats and stuff so it might not work hmm because remember there's like dextra I formats and stuff I know this from back in the day when I'd used to do edit heck you'll just you might have to spend the money to get the cable dude sorry all right well let's get into some angst sometimes there are things that happen in the world that make us angry and we always do this segment every week to just just get it out of our system so we can be the happy host you know I was really trying to think of one okay this is gonna require some backstory and it is a little bit of family goings-on for me my my brother's girlfriend and her mother were found dead on Monday in Silver Hill Alabama so if anyone in the area who knows them don't you know say you heard anything well I mean I just it's not I guess so much of a fuck you type of thing it's just more of a regrettable thing I actually have to say everyone and Nina they actually don't know if it the whole theory is that it's carbon monoxide poisoning what killed them in there and at the mobile home they lived in because the last anyone heard anything was Friday and Matt didn't find out no one found out until Monday when they found them but I'm just saying there's no excuse not to have a carbon monoxide tester even if that wasn't the cause that it's inconclusive right now they're treating it as a homicide but even so if it was carbon monoxide or some type of gas monitoring or anything there really shouldn't be any excuse if there's not a way to monitor that I'd say everyone your your homes and your health and your lives are that important you should invest a little bit monitoring don't they sell and if they don't why not smoke detectors that double as carbon monoxide they do it's a good thing to have you know how they regulate smoke detectors in public they should be regulating the multi detectors people with smoke in the house they turn off smoke detectors I know I know I know it's and you know especially a lot of the manufacturing with some it was some of those mobile homes are not always up to standard it's always very important that they be checked out you know is I mean my brother's girlfriend she was 18 and her mom was in her 50s and both way too young to you know well it's very unfortunate I'm sorry to hear it yeah and and not my brother Matthew he's was a bit of a mess when I talked to him but he seems to be doing better well yeah I would be too so can't blame him so let that tragedy be awareness for everybody it's no joke just like you know unfortunately I had a tragedy where I lost someone h1n1 last year it's no joke some of these things you're about no joke all right Loki your refuse the week we're in need a dick and fart joke to kind of help things out here relieve the tension well this guy was a dick I don't have anything no way of working fart I guess I guess you could make a fart sound when you call them though this is the guy last week that stole my Xbox 360 or whatever and I said yes I'll try to get a hold of him see if everything works out blah blah blah obviously wasn't expecting to hear from him and never did so you may be able to hear from him instead so here's his phone number if you want to give him a call shoot him a text you know annoy him whatever also have an email address to work with that too and who knows when you know he may very well have a disposable phone you know I think he has an iPhone so he likes text messages he doesn't like voicemails because he doesn't seem to answer his voicemails anyways phone number is area code two oh nine nine eight one seven five nine five or you can email him at I extreme JF at gmail.com that's I X T R E M E JF at gmail.com well is that number again that number once again was two zero nine nine eight one seven five nine five it's also honored it's also in my Twitter if you have questions I'll be happy to repost it in chat as well and you know feel free to give him a text tell him what kind of a right now Brad from pop culture says we should call him on the show it doesn't matter I don't know how I feel about Loki doing that anyway but I understand he's pissed so whatever let Loki speaks for low whatever I we I already contacted the police I just don't think I was gonna happen but I'm glad you did you know I mean they even though they have a phone number it's hard it's probably got changed you know he could very well just get rid of the phone number or it could be the iPhone was probably stolen anyway yeah honestly all right well bummer at the very least though I still get jtech system I have one coming off of eBay legit and we'll be here this week well I'm glad your story yeah invalid number yep change the number plumber all right in part change the email to let's see my if you you should look for other similar sounding things in Stockton though like search Craigslist for my okay good all right um my f you I'll try to keep a brief I I've had to make a very tough decision over the weekend and so you know like with any decision you have those two guys that sit on your shoulder not necessarily the angel and the devil but the you know advocate and for one side the advocate for other that yell and argue back and forth so although I'm fairly confident in this decision I'm about to make I say f you to the the guy that sits on my shoulder saying are you sure are you sure we could get you a big boozy to shoot him with but then I would shoot myself there's a how I feel about guns you're saying an F you to the grant the granny questions do you wish to save are you sure is that your final answer if you to Regis Philbin for making that a pop culture thing if you Regis all right couple more news stories for you guys and then like it or not the skyline will be open one eight seven seven game olr because it is the show where every gamer has a voice Loki Activision and Fendi Ward are asking you do you suffer from apathy that's right they're playing on releasing the first map pack for modern warfare 2 becoming tax box live on March 30th no word yet when PlayStation 3 will be getting it but apparently it's gonna be a timed exclusive type of thing what will the map pack include well it will include a couple new maps some that are to call I guess two of them are quality for modern warfare 1 remakes also apparently there's gonna be let's see here some other ones including a bailout which is a multi-level apartment complex that sounds kind of cool storm and open industrial park littered with heavy machinery salvages snowy junkyard fortified with stacked debris and crushed cars and I guess two of the maps that are getting remade from called before include crash which is against a war-torn urban environment and overgrown which is a massive dry creek bed kind of neat all right lots of fun modern warfare developments there I'm hoping actually none of those map packs I see the heads of infinity more say where the was the content designed before the heads of infinity Ward were axed I'm assuming no it's kind of funny they're all you gotta love the the name of the download content is the stimulus package is if that's not a slap in the face I don't know what is oh did you and they should have called it infinity Ward you know I didn't realize this because I don't really play games like modern warfare I mean not that they're bad they're just games I don't really play I had heard that the credits in that game are kind of funny because like all the studio credits you know they scroll by or whatever then when it gets to the credits for Activision it speeds up and they run by like eight times as fast and then it goes back to normal like there's always that tongue-in-cheek we don't like Activision thing going on those games I heard that on another show I thought that was funny all right uh let's how about some news on monkey Island monkey Island is coming to PSN Mac telltale and instant action I guess let's see the game store of course instant action calm would be the other thing we're talking about there it's the special edition of the secret of monkey Island and it's coming out that's pretty cool though I think a lot of people have been waiting for it on PSN and of course the Mac so there you go the island is sweet mm-hmm and by the way the sequel the secret of monkey Island to even more sweet coming out on Xbox Live Arcade PSN PC and the iPhone though the ending is really strange well there it is the secret of monkey Island to coming out this summer on all those systems so it's not quite the special edition just so you know it's just some new controls on the classic game but still still what a good what a good game good times all right I guess that's it for now should we try to open up the Skype line and take some calls sure all right wide up one eight seven seven game olr our username on Skype is orange lounge radio Skype line is open for business while we wait for some calls because it takes about a minute for the chatters to get the message Loki have any last-minute stories for us or I don't know dark soccer you have anything okay then Loki I'm sure I do and I'm just trying to navigate myself towards the webpage where said stories would be um let's see here let's talk about guitar freaks XG apparently it's been released I'm assuming in Japan because I sure as hell haven't seen one over here then again I've been an arcade in forever but yes guitar freaks Romania XG has been released in Japan and of course you may remember XG is the one where they have the extra buttons on the guitar and then the drums are a little bit fancier and whatnot but uh but is the game fun I don't know well let's go to the phones hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hi this act F hi act F what's on your mind our friendly neighborhood Mexican how are you pretty fine I just wanted to ask a quick question about the ps3 yes maybe look Loki can answer this I've been hearing and reading in forums that there there are ps3 shortages yeah there's rumors going around that I've been hearing it's basically they're trying to sandbag their numbers for the next financial year because even right now God of War 3 there were shortage problems and there's also rumors that there's a disc pressing problem for God of War 3 because I know art we got shorted pretty bad as well as everyone else did apparently but it's been anything first party Sony's been hard to get for like the whole year so far and it's supposed to be a lot better in April when their new financial year starts so that they're basically trying to suck as much sales as they can to next year to make it look better let me jump in for a minute here because yeah I just to support what you're saying I got a text message when ps3 mageddon was going on and it was one of my friends who I guess booted up her ps3 and it was right when the issue happened so nobody knew that there was a time and date issue going on and she thought the thing was broken so she went to Best Buy and text messaged me and said dude you might want to know for your show Best Buy has no PlayStation threes in stock and their computer has one in the nation located in a store and I was like I kind of took that as a really type of thing and I didn't like I got the text messages after the show so I didn't even really give it a second thought but it does sound like there's some type of shortage going on strange yeah I thought it was related to the the apocalypse thing that happened on February 28 no it's nothing to do with that it's just they've been out for a while and usually if there's some sort of time period right after you know the fourth quarter that they're trying to catch up because they basically you know at least on a distribution side they try to ship everything to retailers and the retailers leave them on their shelves and that's that I want to say though it's a blessing in some ways that that happened when ps3 Magetta and happened because think about how many people might have done what my friend did almost did and saying my ps3 stopped working guess it's time for me to get a new one and actually goes out and buys a new one and then oh it was just a 24-hour issue shit you know like well you could always return it I guess so but you know some stores take a fee for that and stuff so it's maybe a blessing in disguise that there were hardly any ps3s on shelves to get so people couldn't have that knee-jerk reaction of oh I'll just get a new ps3 probably thank gosh or else Sony might have been in some bigger doo-doo than they were but you notice how most people already forgot that that happened already already passed it we've moved on interesting Bob coffee in our chat room chat dot orange on twitter.com piping in Walmart hasn't gotten any in a while either giovide says my targets been out for three weeks so definitely not just a best buy thing it does sound like there is some truth to this rumor but you watch if if all sudden in April they start having tons of them everywhere that's why because they were sandbagging them really I didn't think about it that way that's a really that's the rumors Nintendo doing something like that too or are they still saying oh well I don't know you're gonna hear a lot more stuff about Sony this week because destination PlayStation is happening now that's the retail only event but there's always people that manage to sneak their way in moles and stuff of course yeah because we have our people it's kind of bad that that happened it's happening right now it's considering that there's Final Fantasy 13 and God of War coming out next week so I don't know why they well you already explained it but I I would expect them to at least put a little more of the consoles out there in the market keep in mind though act F Sony lost a lot of oomph and people running out to buy a ps3 for Final Fantasy 13 when it jumped ship to 360 as well and you know like I've mentioned earlier in the night I think it was over on Bobby show but you know there really is no reason to run out and buy a ps3 if you already have a 360 for Final Fantasy 13 just get it on the 360 the differences are not major enough to necessitate the change but God of War 3 now you can't get that anywhere else so yeah I think you make a good point it seems really strange that Sony would not want God of War 3 to be moving because that that's a system seller for some people it really is I know they just figured that they're gonna sell those copies it's just if they don't sell them right now it's no big deal but we'll see I mean well act F we gotta let you go so we can get more calls do you have any other thoughts for us tonight no not really not yes that question right now all right wait you have a good one take it ready adios see since we have all these people that call in from different countries I really need to make it a point to at least learn like hello and goodbye in the local languages luckily I already know Spanish for my time I had in high school but I'm gonna need if IK ripper gets through tonight or whoever from Sweden gets through I'm gonna need to know how to say hello and goodbye in Swedish so and it's not bork bork bork what useful Swedish phrases and words are you googling it yes I am okay well hold hold on to that and if IK ripper call I don't even know if he's listening if he calls tonight I will have you be our unofficial ambassador I can't read any of this hi you're on Orange Laundry do who's this hey spazz nator what's on your mind I'm not much yeah I was just gonna comment on what Loki was seen like five minutes ago you know last week up issued these everything with his one system mean that they won't jerk off this kind of screw them over yeah well you know I try calling the number dollar day you know at least all the day the number was working if you know if he doesn't mind I would like to give more constructive criticism for me oh wait hold on Loki Loki are you willing to accept some constructive criticism yeah sure why not all right then go ahead yeah yeah I know this is kind of some somewhat harsh but I I could have seen this coming a mile away for a couple couple reasons if I put Lussy on Craigslist which is practically the ghetto of the Internet you know you hear reports you know other news by Craigslist practically every other day but the personal ads are hilarious that's true well hold on let me give Loki a chance to defend himself why did you go to the bowels of the internet I mean well I don't know I mean there there are there is 4chan because Craigslist Craigslist is kind of in that same you know colony area of the internet what made you decide to go there to get your needs basically because and you know really looking at it now I could probably just done a j-tag install myself but the thing is I wanted to install the cyclot the the Cygnus to mod ship in there and that's a lot more difficult to install versus you know the just a j-tag a j-tag I mean shit I could I could do that I mean that it's like seven solder points and that's it and they're big but the reason why I went in Craigslist and stuff like eBay although I lucked out on eBay because someone sold it cuz eBay they're not allowed to sell that stuff you can't sell modded consoles you can't sell mod chips you can't sell anything like that every now and then stuff slips through where you can buy that stuff thankfully I was able to buy one of those and really it wouldn't have been a big deal to go you know testing why should done is gone should have just not let the console should have just gone with the car did he try to talk you into it like okay buddy all you know just come back in a couple hours and I'll have your console all done it wasn't even that it was like 30 minutes like I was gonna go eat and whose idea was it to leave his but you know I could see that where that would be something you know we're yeah when you're in that I mean yeah I understand it was 2020 but when you're in the moment and you're like okay I kind of trust this guy he's got his phone lots of for me from Craigslist before and it's been fine yeah and and to be fair although I'm joking about it being you know the bells the internet I I've seen job postings and stuff work on there's people on great companies posted availabilities and Craigslist so there are useful purposes I think if if as far as it goes with like services and stuff like that you just have to be careful as far as like you know especially with adult services for the love of God if you're gonna seek adult services on Craigslist you not only need to use protect you need to use like three methods of protection all at once and that's assuming that it is actually somebody and not just a police sting yeah and then you're gonna want to bay them bleach honestly yeah but you know no seriously you know it's just you know some stupid things and what you need to do obviously if you're getting you know some services done online you know where you're gonna get something taken for you a legitimate person would give you like some sort of receipt you would you would have an address you wouldn't you know go to an address and he'd be waiting outside of like I there's a lot of red flags like for example the address that he gave me you know it's an apartment complex it's not not a house I thought it was a house I was like okay well that guy's address you know where's he gonna go you know it's a house but knows apartment complex where his friend probably lived and let her yeah who knows but he has this down to a science he ripped you off he'll rip someone else up my question is what's he doing with all these 360s I don't know probably selling them all right let me fuck drugs who knows it's a spazz nator I'm sorry yeah I was good yeah I was about to say the same thing for at least 10 to 15 years and now well now throughout the country not just my area or even just your area councils especially when they're still at the $250 to $300 range are really really big with seed they take those $250 to $300 console deal them turn around turn around and sell them for 50 to $100 and Dell or just trade them straight out for drugs whether their drug of choice happen happen you never know and it's a bummer with since Xbox has the ability to lock out your console when you you know when you do something naughty and expose life it's kind of a pity they don't have a type of service where you could call in and find out where your 360 is or who's connecting to the internet and I mean granted they don't want to help people like Loki but some people get their 360s legitimately stolen out of their home like I remember spazz nator weren't you the guy that had your ps3 taken right out of your house yeah yeah yeah and oh well I lean off Bob back in 2003 literally just as the calories switch over from July to August two guys barged into my apartment building and it's going by PlayStation 2 I called the police immediately but you know unfortunately you know with buffer police I hate to see it you know what there's like a whole stash of jelly filled bullets it's hard to track to because there's not like unique license plates or whatever but there is I mean there's a serial number I have the serial number but it's a bummer you can't track the way it does it's a bummer Xbox punch in serial number and you know here's the thing tells you where it's the guy knew what he was doing as far as j-tagging stuff because he knew what he was talking about but like he probably not only runs a service he probably mod your stolen 360 and sells it well here's the thing and I don't really have a problem of 360 was stolen I have a problem that I waited you know four hours in Stockton don't waste my time exactly I'm like if you're the DCC to just mug me you know seriously if he's gonna steal my system just don't respond back to any of my phone calls at all instead of like dragging on for four fucking hours okay because that was really the issue I have 360 consoles I don't really give a crap if one of them goes away it's it's just an inconvenience for me to sit there for four fucking hours in a car waiting for somebody I gotta wrap up here and let's fascinating in his final thoughts cuz we had to get some more calls but I do want to read this comment from chat cuz it's funny Brad from pod culture says this is why my apartment is protected by the sword of omens no shit I have a replica here in the studio that's a weenie we need a sword in the oil our studio okay maybe not dar Sakura might have a gun but she knows not to tell me seriously I have knives I've had my ex I have had all my airsoft guns stolen that was worth way more than this stupid 360 and like I just let it roll right off me it's you know it's a 360 whatever you know I'd be screaming I got it's all right I got four more they're broken so I gotta let's pass nator wrap up because we gotta get more calls spasm nator thank you for the lively discussion inspiration do you have any other lots for our listeners tonight nothing comes to mind nothing they'll take five seconds or less but I'll I'll talk to Loki about this you should wear your eyes throughout the weekend like live or on Twitter or whatever so just be careful he might mess with you like he was messing with cheeseburger oh that was just earlier and hey I can't believe he got so confused by and I was just like he must have me confused the other Loki you're so rude you know all right all right take care of spasm nator thanks for the call have a good one yep I gotta ask spasm nator if he's watching the tester because he's a big Sony fan I mean usually he'll cut he'll call in although he I don't know about anymore because I know he's been having his issue with Sony's lately but I gotta ask him if he's been watching that because it seems like as a Sony fan maybe that's something he's into I don't know I can't believe I'm admitting I've actually been watching the tester it's not terrible I'm gonna file it under the Tron and showgirls category it's it's so bad it's kind of good I can't explain it and seriously the whole reason I put they got the guy's phone number and email cuz I know that the police aren't gonna do anything they're not gonna be able to do anything because they don't have a name they don't have an actual law they just they just have it so at least at the very the very least it'll make them think maybe twice about like doing something like that because it's really inconvenient I've got to get to the phones guys the phones are lighting up tonight like there are so look I have a screen full of people trying to get in thank you guys so much I'm just trying to answer these as fast as I can hire an orange launch radio who's this this is Amiga 777 Amiga 777 what is on your mind my friend hi I just like us to send a public apology to some of the listeners from Japan that might have been listening last week hmm I guess about some of the things that I said about you know the whole PlayStation 2 birthday 10-year thing yeah um it actually you know ps2 is alright it it um there there are a lot of things you know kind of going back to that question you're like what could the Dreamcast it done better and so going back on that um well I could I probably enter the end to that question maybe toward in um let's see October you know which is technically the the month that it came out the ps2 came out here and now the u.s. okay no amiga I remember your call and I don't I don't think you have to go out of your way to apologize it was your own opinion and what-have-you and last week was a little bit crazy anyway but um you know I I think you kind of bring up a point though that certainly the PlayStation 2 saw levels of success in other countries that may not have even been you know kind of duplicated here or what have you okay that was just one thing those on my mind all right well you know what it it it takes a real man to man up to an apology although I don't think you needed to apologize he had a perfectly fine opinion but that's that's fine you you said your piece but I I think can't we all just get along there's room there's room in retro gaming love for ps2 and Dreamcast and plenty of it no take care of me guy have a good one take care later eight seven seven game olr is the name to call or is the number to call but our phones are lighting up there's like back-to-back calls hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hey this is Brad from pod culture well hello Brad from cop pod culture what's up mine Oh Loki you are far more laid-back than I ever would be I know just based on your Twitter and some of the problems you I won't get into it cuz on your Twitter so the reason I don't get you've been having with a certain realty company you've been dealing with I I you do not strike me as the type that would be as passive as Loki but I'm redheaded I got the temperament to go with it that's all right that's all right well there's just not much I can do with what the information I have and stuff it's not like I can go the guy's house and demand you know justice I don't know I don't know where the hell he lives and I don't know what the hell's name is I mean cuz he's used like a couple different names and so you know at this point lesson learned you know that's all you have to do you have to use this as an opportunity not that we should be encouraging people to mod their consoles anyway but you had a legitimate I mean I think it's legitimate to want to mod your 360 to play Japanese games every week on this show I talk about Japanese release dates and even just tonight I said oh here's the game on the 360 looks interesting it'll never come out over here so people have a legitimate reason to want to mod their 360 to play Japanese games but let Loki's pain be a lesson to the rest of you be careful and if somebody smart use common sense and oh I didn't use this don't trust a dude you met on Craigslist with your console ever do not walk away don't get talking to it just say no I'll just hang out here well I can I watch you do it or whatever or you know I'll just I'll just kind of just you know sit here and watch you from my car be just upfront honest be like listen dude I don't I just met you I don't fucking trust you so you know I'm going with the console you know you either gonna you know do this real quick and the other thing too I mean it's like seriously if it's going to take four hours I want to be there fucking going hey listen are you done are you done are you done are you done you know or like you know if it's taking too damn long list and I'll just finish the rest of home you know because that it's just it's absolutely ridiculous I have to wait for four hours and it's Just that was the part that pissed me off is the fact that he drug it out for four fucking hours If you're gonna steal the thing just say you just don't reply back or just reply back to the text You know sucker and then that's it He's like seriously. What are you gonna? Do it's like you know I can't track you down I don't know the fuck you live so you know I wish I did follow him cuz then I'd know where the fuck you lived I would be going right straight to his apartment or probably just wouldn't have gotten anything me Oh, just or one of the listeners will have gone straight to his apartment by now, but unfortunately probably there you go Well, I did you have any do you have any any further advice? I guess maybe for Loki don't use crack I don't know I Well, you know trust no one Pretty much if I tore or if you're gonna go use someone on Craigslist or whatever like that Just like be really crazy about it, and they'll fingerprint the guy you know or you know Or if you if he takes your 360 take their driver's license or something That could be fake too. Well most people. I don't think would expect that you know it's true Yeah, the one time I had a console chipped It was somebody who knew somebody and that was back in the day when my PlayStation 1 oh Man the PlayStation 1 was so easy to mod though you had a dark Sakura bought me a plug It's like a present for I don't know something that I just plugged into the back of the thing you did I don't know if you remember Mix I got mine chip just to play two games You did that's how we play remember the one day in my apartment We all came all the sacramentals came over to play DDR third mix That's when I discovered my love for erotic and oh Nick, please not so quick. Yeah The thing that I the IO port thing Mm-hmm yeah, yeah, there's like a little plug in the back you gave me one the game because I think you know I don't have the skills disorder, so I had someone do I also have another our form looking to get rid of We use those for a while, but like for the longest time Dan And I didn't need them because we could still disk swap on our PlayStation The single swap oh Yeah, there was like a trick you could do for it the first one It was just the single stop and swap it would load the um the PlayStation screen, and then you stop the spinner by Pressing the little button to the thing yeah, and then you move it out We used a paperclip to do it crazy crazy stuff all right well Brad anything else in your mind tonight You want to talk about well with the you know games are expensive and stuff, and I've got the studio and turmoil here Cuz we're packing up to move but to save a few bucks and some something that not everyone might think about is I've been buying a lot of games used from game fly Chief I just picked up like brutal legend Batman Arkham Asylum and Ghostbusters for like less than a price of one game new they've been sending me I've actually been using game fly now I have this really bad habit of hanging on to one game for like six months But yeah, they send me emails all the time about hey Do you just want to buy the game you've had for like four months? you Know and it's it's not a bad idea, and I think they give you like a little bit of money I mean, it's like five bucks ten bucks It's not very significant, but it's enough to try and hook you the little fish bait You know I don't know if I hook you you know they're there They're at the top of their game for the service. They're providing It's not a service for ever for everybody, but it's a it's a good service So I don't use it that often just like I'm kind of broke right now, but yeah use games nothing wrong with that There's so many games that came out like a year ago that I didn't have time to play that there's There's 20 bucks a pop now for real for real so good advice to the Gamer in this economy I suppose all right well Brad We got to let you go because our phone lines have been on fire And I want to get at least one more call hey later guys later, buddy Alright again, please don't be butthurt if you don't get through our phone call or of course now It's not lit up, but probably cuz everyone still hears Brad on the phone. I wanted to tell you Rob Yeah, I actually went on to the iTunes store cuz really I wanted to buy Final Fantasy 2 And I found reviews for Street Fighter 4. Oh, yes, I come out during GDC. I heard yeah, yeah I'm probably gonna pick it up after payday. I'm just given that out of 567 reviews It's it's currently sitting at Let me see okay out of 894 ratings it's got 668 five-star, so it's currently at a four and a half star. That's not bad And yeah, I couldn't believe though that controls are any good, but we got another call So I'm gonna go to the phones hi you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? CT hey I haven't heard from you in a long time. How are you DT? I know good good good. What's that shirt by the way? What's that? It's not a shirt from our first tournament Way the hell back. Oh my god. That's like finding your class of 96 shirt in a truck somewhere That's awesome. Yes the what would the first tournament was scat right? Cosplay and tournament for those that don't know okay again Let me just let me quickly give the backstory for those that have listened to olr a very long time This show was formed because Loki myself and dark Sakura and DT You're a part of this circle too would meet up at the arcade and play DDR games And that's how we all kind of met and of course our show started about music-based video games because of that But when the memani series started kind of tapering off, you know we branched out to saying you know well hell We play all video games. We don't just play DDR. Let's talk about all video games So that's that's where we've been at for a few years um, but as part of this DDR tournament throwing or as part of this DDR loving circle We used to throw tournaments and the first one we had was scat sacramentals because we're from Sacramento, California Cosplay and tournament and we actually encouraged people to dress up although I think we had like maybe four people all day that actually came dressed up serious and then we had a DDR tournament which actually for its time a Lot of people like Sacramento we had a ton of people show up Sacramento was kind of the place you went cuz you just don't give a fuck like I think a lot of people didn't take our Tournament that seriously, and it was okay like people had fun with it, and you know me you know dark sire You know Loki we're all about just having fun like I think Loki if I remember right Oh Loki I'm gonna embarrass Loki Loki had a dynamite rave routine ready to go And it was it's not really I just I had at one point memorized dynamite rave backwards And he was dressed up like one of the guys from the matrix because it was that many years ago It was because I had a trench coat on and well That's what you look like and he started to dance and I have and I forgot with the but he laughed He didn't go in the corner and cry He just he was he laughed and we all laughed at him, but no we all left with him alright And then we left at him. No. I'm just kidding, but now look Would we have ever had Loki on the show if it wasn't for dynamite rave and probably we would have but yeah All right, so I'm sorry DT. So you found this shirt. What else did you want to say? Well? Yeah Go ahead dark Tetsuya if you have anything else you want to ask us or talk about tonight the best of That the boys were on 3do mm-hmm Oh the best of yes is it are we are we about ready to roll do we have our best of put together yet? Or what's up? Well, I'm just waiting on this to finish up the narration yeah, I Heard we're gonna have a female MC in the in the guys of misty basically is gonna be doing the Narration for the best of and I'm sure there's gonna be a week in the near future We're not gonna be here in fact actually in two weeks I'm at PAX East so you may see the best of as soon as then because I don't know if I'll be here I mean, maybe dark soccer and Loki will still do the show without me, but I don't fly back till Monday So we may not be here. Maybe That'll be a fun show tune in it for that night when I'm not here and dark soccer is running the control board That's gonna be a high You're gonna have to totally show me the stuff that I'm missing by the way can't wait It's easy. This new this new system is so much easier than our old system. It's easy. So It'll be fun. Anything else on your mind our test for you tonight No, that's it. Just been playing a lot of yes. No to DX didn't you you beat a new song tonight, right? Yeah, I actually passed me. Well, I got this. I don't know if Loki's heard of it the ESR Memory card exploit. Okay? You can play copies on it Mm-hmm. Very cool. Yeah, IDG finally Congratulations, that's quite an accomplishment. So very cool. All right DT I'm gonna let you go. Have a good one, buddy. And thanks for calling. All right. Bye. Bye SSJ 100 Matt actually has a really good suggestion chat saying we should try to do a pre-recorded packed show Actually, what I think would be really funny is that maybe there won't be a live show next week but maybe there'll be some type of recorded show and like cuz I know I'm going to PAX with my buddy seg who Who he was part of the oom loud crew and my friend Amanda who's really funny and she's never been on the show cuz I think She works a lot Sunday nights, but she's you've met Amanda. Of course, Jamie, right, you know little little Amanda It's going to PAX. How random is that go? So we're all going I think it might be fun We might do like a recorded thing and then I know all our fans are gonna be there So I will tell you next week if I'm gonna have a hat or a shirt or something To look for me and I need to look at the schedule. I will pin can finish your scarf You should look for the rainbow scarf. Ah, too bad. You can't make me an orange scarf. I can make you an orange scarf Can you whip one up in like a week and a half? This is me. Do you make you a hat? Can you make one that says olr on it might be a little tough? Might be a little tough. I'm not that good yet. Why don't that make you just a big obnoxious orange scarf? Okay? A big obnoxious orange scarf. Excellent. I'll even put fuzzy fringe on it. Excellent. Make it fuzzy and very gay. Okay. Okay, excellent That means the rainbow one might have to wait a little bit It's for it's for a good cause by the way, the skype line is gonna be closed I'm sorry, don't be butthurt if you didn't get through. I'm very sorry Send us an email mailbag orangeonshorey.com quick write it down now what you were wanting to call in about yeah, big flamey orange scarf and I will find a game room like, you know, they do the game rooms at PAX I'm gonna look at what games are going on and especially if there's like a music based one I will make it a point to be there for like DDR Hour or you know as a throwback to how this show started I will make it a point to be there doing a music game thing and I know there's quite a few Olr listeners going so I hope to see you guys Yeah, and I like what act F to say make a pre-recorded pre-pack show and a best of the same week It'll be a little weird because um, you know, it's not Olr without Loki and dark Sakura So I would say it's a spin-off show for the week that might go to the feed It would actually be a show called Rob goes to PAX or something like that And then I don't know what dark soccer and Loki will do. It'll be funny I think you guys should just do something fucking random like next week Just get together and play a game or something and tape it. It'll be funny Anyway, we'll talk about that over the next couple weeks. If you have ideas email mailbag orangeonshorey.com Sj100 Matt says I should be using the Twitter when I'm at PAX so they can stalk me abs so fucking lutely I'm gonna be on the Twitter you prepare to have your Twitter's flooded with tweets from PAX. I will be doing that on the oil I'll be tasteful. Don't worry. It's Sony supposed to be at PAX because maybe we'll get to play the moves stuff I believe so. I don't know that the PAX is sold out dude, and I didn't go as media. I signed up It's just you know, cuz media packs is really nothing special and I'm purposefully going to be a gamer I am NOT going to be a Reporter I meant they just might have it to play, you know, like a little bit Well, they might they might but it might also be very crowded and hard to get in there to play You know what? I mean remember PAX Prime We weren't able to really play anything, but that one hour we were in early. That was still fun though. So we'll see Yeah, it was fun. It was very fun. All right Some folks in chat really like the idea of dark soccer and Loki doing a show without me. Well fine. I see how you are SSJ 100 Matt says have Dan here and have him take Skype calls the whole show This will be the ring you talk about orange on the radio. Hi. I don't care. Bye Shut the fuck up junkie. I like this. I like where this is going replace me with Dan on back tonight This is my Dan impersonation. Uh What? Shut up. I'm saying have a Loki Jamie and Dan show. I think that's actually really funny Yeah, replace the gay guy with Dan. That'll be hilarious. But um, actually, I don't know if I should say this now, but there is Talks going on for Dan to have a show Should I say that? I don't know. Maybe maybe too early too soon Yeah, we're thinking about doing something Vault related and I will say this much currently it is just an olr Project has nothing to do with all games if we can work it in with all games excellent But there's so many great shows in all games that weren't planned to do it just to say show that's not live. So we'll see More to come and that might not be the only new show coming soon All right anyhow All right So chatters like the idea of a Dan show you better see if Dan's gonna be available packs weekend Tell him the chatters demand it. All right, we're gonna wrap shit up. It's time for us to get out of here first Oh last-minute stories. I don't know if Loki cleared him out. So any other last-minute stories you guys have Kitty youtubes don't count us Some more to kind of go back to what we were talking about guitar freaks germania xg it's rumored that the extra song apparently is a remix of mechanical rock and I guess it's me making it go rock jive and That's kind of neat and then okay, so some other stuff Let's see, there's apparently a new guitar game or I guess a new guitar that's out there This is called the power gig guitar It is not only a guitar controller But it's a real guitar and you can apparently use it with rock band and whatnot And you can also plug it into an amp and actually play a real guitar No word on what the cost is on it though. Let me see here. I Haven't said what the cost is on it yet, but it looks neat. I guess if you want a guitar Although I just probably just buy a separate guitar. You know, that's just me Then also there's a little bit more tying in with the whole viral campaign that valve has been doing with portal apparently during their GDC Thing there was a blue screen of death that was created and that there was some error code or whatever and apparently if you Translate the error code. It says suspended until e3 or ee So obviously they're going down something portal twos at e3 da da and da exactly Also, Battlestar Galactica is apparently getting an MMO fracking awesome and It's interesting though. It says that it's being developed for sci-fi I guess by big point which they've done several titles in the genre, I guess before and I guess it'll be Coming out this autumn on the sci-fi s website for an exclusive 30-day period then I don't know where it's going from there. I Gotta say, you know since we've now finally done what we told the listeners We're gonna do for years and we did our fuck show last week We might have to do a frack show the week Battlestar Galactica comes out I'm just kidding awful. I'm kidding. We'll need we need a new epic show idea. I'm sure one will come up soon enough There's still the wheel of wheel of obscenity that I've wheel of obscenity turn turn turn show us the curse word that we should learn exactly Yeah, and that's pretty much it for now, all right That's it. We're gonna do a wrap it up and get on out of here for the night It's a good show though is fun. Lots of lots of ground covered tonight considering, you know This was the week that Final Fantasy 13 came out We did a very good job of talking about a lot of games and not just Not just that one tonight because we talked about it all last week amongst the f-words But anyhow, thank you guys very much for tuning in and listening We really appreciate you guys tuning in and supporting us and and the reviews like I said earlier and all that, you know Once again, I always say this we do this show for free because it's fun And it's it's like getting the family together to have a good time So if you like what you hear all we ask tell a couple people tell one tell two people You know about this show help us spread the word and if you're like Rob, I've told everybody I can't think of anyone else to tell then please post a review somewhere iTunes the zoom listing podcast alley wherever There's plenty of podcasting sites help us spread the word and there's even some folks have gone so far to do forum signatures and stuff That is like way more than we could ask for and really appreciate it. Just you know, so thank you very much Uh, let's go around and get everybody's final thought. I'll start with my final thought. My final thought is I want a taco again Yes, it's a Sunday night tradition taco taco taco dark soccer your final thought. I love my kitty Yes, there's shirmy youtubes now, huh? Yeah, there's shirmy has two youtubes up But I also was watching Maru the cat and that's cute, too Loki your final thought tonight two more weeks I get to play the rock star staff and grand theft auto 4 and I intend on kicking the crap out of them Can't wait. Are you gonna film it somehow? You gotta make that happen Make it happen. I could do that. I guess make it work. That would be sweet But the problem is because they're doing an event because they do these every now and then I always miss them But it's actually during my work time that Happens to take place and it's teams of two that you get to go play against them but I'm just gonna kick the crap out of them and it's gonna be hilarious. Can't wait. Can't wait. All right well, thank you guys very much and Tune in next week. We'll be back next week with more orange launch radio Jamie may be a little late, but that's not gonna stop the show. So We'll be back next week with more orange launch radio. Yes, Jamie.
