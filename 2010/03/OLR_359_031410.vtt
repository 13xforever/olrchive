00:48.040 --> 00:49.040
Woo.

00:49.040 --> 00:50.040
Woo.

00:50.040 --> 00:51.040
That sounds good.

00:51.040 --> 00:52.040
Woo.

00:52.040 --> 00:53.040
Woo.

00:53.040 --> 00:54.040
Woo.

00:54.040 --> 00:55.040
Woo.

00:55.040 --> 00:56.040
Woo.

00:56.040 --> 00:57.040
Woo.

00:57.040 --> 00:58.040
Woo.

00:58.040 --> 00:59.040
Woo.

00:59.040 --> 01:00.040
Woo.

01:00.040 --> 01:01.040
Not like woo, but woo.

01:01.040 --> 01:02.040
I like a Ric Flair kind of woo.

01:02.040 --> 01:03.780
Alright, also joining us, say hello to Tech Master Loki, who I noticed is eating barbecued

01:03.780 --> 01:04.780
chicken.

01:04.780 --> 01:05.780
Yes.

01:05.780 --> 01:06.780
I have to be sure that I'm not getting chicken sauce on.

01:06.780 --> 01:07.780
At least he has chicken.

01:07.780 --> 01:08.780
Woo.

01:08.780 --> 01:09.780
Barbecued chicken gets a woo?

01:09.780 --> 01:10.780
Sure.

01:10.780 --> 01:11.780
Alright.

01:11.780 --> 01:13.160
I'm almost out of root beer, and that's not good.

01:13.160 --> 01:18.760
I got him to put no ice this time so it doesn't water down with that useless frozen water.

01:18.760 --> 01:22.880
no one is eating pie and today is pie day happy pie day to all of our

01:22.880 --> 01:26.640
listeners we had a donut I don't know if that counts actually I did have

01:26.640 --> 01:33.280
something kind of pie like okay I went I like I went to Charlie's Cafe and had

01:33.280 --> 01:39.720
the banana cream pie well that's a pie um waffle oh they put pie filling on the

01:39.720 --> 01:43.000
waffle oh that's kind of strange delicious and they put chocolate chips

01:43.000 --> 01:46.880
on that you dessert for breakfast I know it was no some people eat breakfast for

01:46.880 --> 01:51.720
dinner like I didn't really eat anything like for five hours after that

01:51.720 --> 01:57.440
because it was like full of pan of waffle waffle II pie goodness waffle and

01:57.440 --> 02:01.720
pie I can think of no two better foods unless there was bacon somehow involved

02:01.720 --> 02:08.560

02:59.120 --> 03:02.840
be we're gonna get into some gaming news here in a little bit but we always start

03:02.840 --> 03:06.760
off just as we have the past several years talking about how is your gaming

03:06.760 --> 03:09.760
week and dark soccer what kind of video games you've been playing this week

03:09.760 --> 03:18.760
Atari yeah I played Gorf and I played tempest 3000 I played tempest 2000 I

03:18.760 --> 03:25.000
played I'll just go ahead and say it I played Space Harrier on the Atari XL

03:25.000 --> 03:29.880
hmm a beta interesting is like a new thing or like a prototype that never

03:29.880 --> 03:34.160
happened it's a new thing it's developed development right now I met the guy did

03:34.160 --> 03:40.240
the soundtrack oh very cool cool um I played what else did I play I played

03:40.240 --> 03:46.080
centipede on the Atari XL with a remapped trackball

03:46.080 --> 03:50.840
play a little peggle play a lot of actually not really a whole lot of

03:50.840 --> 04:01.720
Star Trek online I did like a battle and yeah all right well we'll come back to

04:01.720 --> 04:07.400
talk a little later about all the Atari stuff Dan actually got um Gradius the

04:07.400 --> 04:15.360
Gradius thing for we the Gradius rebirth yeah the redone Gradius yeah and so it

04:15.360 --> 04:20.560
was fun watching him cuss at the Moai heads I didn't but you know I bought

04:20.560 --> 04:23.240
that but I didn't really play enough of it I got distracted with something else

04:23.240 --> 04:33.080
using of course of course Loki how was your gaming week well not too eventful

04:33.080 --> 04:44.360
I played Final Fantasy 13 and I'm made like six hours into it and played more

04:44.360 --> 04:51.080
Grand Theft Auto and actually part of the week our internet was down at work

04:51.080 --> 04:57.520
or our network in the room that we have the 360s in so we ended up playing some

04:57.520 --> 05:02.880
old-school Saints Row one a death or death match multiplayer so that's fun

05:02.880 --> 05:08.000
because you could do a system link on those and they don't require Xbox Live

05:08.000 --> 05:14.720
and then I did check out the demo for just cause two it's pretty fun not as

05:14.720 --> 05:22.600
fun as I would hoped but I think I'd like it kind of got that mercenaries to

05:22.600 --> 05:26.320
vibe to it I mean it's very similar obviously to the first just cause game

05:26.320 --> 05:34.280
but thankfully it is well very much higher production value than mercenaries

05:34.280 --> 05:42.680
to in that game was glitched out every which way possible so I did finish

05:42.680 --> 05:48.040
downloading the blur multiplayer beta haven't played it yet so that'll be

05:48.040 --> 05:52.800
pretty fun they're supposed to be adding some more codes for that so hopefully

05:52.800 --> 05:53.880
I'll be able to give you one

05:53.880 --> 05:58.320
Rob so I got one I just I'm in the same boat you are I had so much other stuff

05:58.320 --> 06:02.760
going on and I was really excited about blur too but I keep now I'll get into it

06:02.760 --> 06:03.760
a minute

06:03.760 --> 06:10.160
so yeah I think that's really all I played this week I tried going back to

06:10.160 --> 06:15.280
play some more Borderlands but since I've been modding the hell out of it I

06:15.280 --> 06:18.560
finally downloaded the patch that's supposed to get rid of all that stuff

06:18.560 --> 06:25.040
and it kind of jacked up my game like now it won't load my save game correctly

06:25.040 --> 06:30.000
and it's not a big deal because I don't really care about the progress in the

06:30.000 --> 06:35.040
game or my level or whatever cuz I've been cheating anyways it's just that I

06:35.040 --> 06:38.320
don't have to go do all those quests again because it's a lot of just running

06:38.320 --> 06:46.000
around it's really annoying so I have to go through and get to be fixed again and

06:46.000 --> 06:47.440
then I'll cheat again

06:47.440 --> 06:51.560
oh by the way I am also cheating through Final Fantasy 13 because you can you

06:51.560 --> 06:56.320
know edit the save games to do all sorts of crazy stuff if you can cheat it or

06:56.320 --> 06:58.520
hack it or crack it Loki's probably done it

06:58.520 --> 07:02.200
by the way speaking of hacking and cheating I think Dan wants to talk to

07:02.200 --> 07:05.320
you about something related to a Japanese Xbox game

07:05.320 --> 07:11.960
okay awesome anyhow if that's it for Loki's gaming week then I'll go ahead

07:11.960 --> 07:16.320
my gaming week yeah like Loki said I I got into the blur beta but sadly I've

07:16.320 --> 07:21.400
just been so into Final Fantasy 13 that like all of my gaming time has been

07:21.400 --> 07:26.440
sucked into Final Fantasy 13 I'm about 16 hours in at this point and I get the

07:26.440 --> 07:30.720
sense I am like right before something epic that's gonna happen in the story

07:30.720 --> 07:35.920
like again I'm not gonna give out spoilers I am very you know touchy with

07:35.920 --> 07:40.280
spoilers too it's like don't even joke and chat like we will kick ban you and

07:40.280 --> 07:43.500
we're not at the point I think you have to be about six months out before it's

07:43.500 --> 07:47.360
okay to spoil like you know but I get the feeling I'm coming up on something

07:47.360 --> 07:52.520
pretty epic about to happen in the game also there's something else that a lot

07:52.520 --> 07:56.160
of hints have been dropped for and again I'm being very cautious here I'm not

07:56.160 --> 07:59.320
gonna spoil anything because I don't even know if I'm right but I feel like

07:59.320 --> 08:03.560
there's been a lot of hints dropped over the past couple hours to something in

08:03.560 --> 08:08.960
the story that I kind of didn't see coming and there's one it's one of those

08:08.960 --> 08:12.280
like I haven't seen that in a Final Fantasy game before and if I'm right

08:12.280 --> 08:16.400
it's kind of one of those well played Square Enix well played I think I think

08:16.400 --> 08:20.280
there's something up I can't again I don't want to spoil that uh but

08:20.280 --> 08:24.640
definitely the story in the game is really good like you know I think a lot

08:24.640 --> 08:27.240
of people played through the first three hours and there's definitely your

08:27.240 --> 08:31.440
characters that are likable and dislikable but as that the thing that

08:31.440 --> 08:36.020
was mentioned last week the game is like a banana that slowly peels back to

08:36.020 --> 08:39.300
reveal all of its layers or maybe like an everlasting gobstopper because it

08:39.300 --> 08:42.720
takes so long to get through and there's all these different colored layers you

08:42.720 --> 08:46.200
definitely start to see that there is more to the story than what you saw in

08:46.200 --> 08:49.640
the first few hours I do like very and I do like the weapon upgrade system

08:49.640 --> 08:52.840
because I was like wondering well those components were for big yeah I thought

08:52.840 --> 08:55.720
it's gonna be more of like crafting though instead of like okay these

08:55.720 --> 09:01.160
components equal X number of experience and your levels go up and the weapon

09:01.160 --> 09:05.880
does more damage or whatever well it's interesting it takes so long in the game

09:05.880 --> 09:08.880
before you get to that so yes those of you that haven't gotten that far yet

09:08.880 --> 09:12.080
yes all that crap you're collecting you will use later on to upgrade your

09:12.080 --> 09:14.840
weapons that's not really a spoiler that's that's just a game mechanic

09:14.840 --> 09:20.440
that's nobody yeah so but anyway the story I just got to say I if I'm right

09:20.440 --> 09:23.620
at what I kind of have a hunch is what's going on I'm gonna be like very

09:23.620 --> 09:26.860
interesting and in six months when the moratorium on spoilers is up and it's

09:26.860 --> 09:31.000
okay to spoil I want to get into it cuz it's it's I'm just wondering if we kill

09:31.000 --> 09:38.260
the cyber Pope because you know he looks like he has it coming my favorite

09:38.260 --> 09:41.160
character though I think is still saws because he does have a chocobo that

09:41.160 --> 09:44.160
lives in his hair and the chocobo gets a little more personality as the story

09:44.160 --> 09:50.200
goes on and it's it's disgustingly cute disgustingly cute and I was gonna say

09:50.200 --> 09:58.160
that the Shiva sisters they're their motorcycle is naughty I I am so happy

09:58.160 --> 10:05.240
that Final Fantasy has gone back to this just epic over-the-top summons thing in

10:05.240 --> 10:09.280
the game like that I you back to like Final Fantasy 7 where it was like Knights

10:09.280 --> 10:14.440
of the round and all this well ten yeah ten had it too it did it did there was

10:14.440 --> 10:17.920
one ten did have the Shiva that would come out and snap her fingers and then

10:17.920 --> 10:21.280
the ice would shatter everywhere it's nice to see that again there was one

10:21.280 --> 10:24.800
part though of the game that I didn't like so I mean it was kind of annoying

10:24.800 --> 10:28.960
thankfully it was a really short section of the game but you know they kind of

10:28.960 --> 10:32.480
tried to change the gameplay up a little bit when you get that little mech thing

10:32.480 --> 10:36.320
that you walk around in for about five not even five minutes like two minutes

10:36.320 --> 10:41.000
that was a waste of time I can see why some people are kind of in on Final

10:41.000 --> 10:45.560
Fantasy 13 because it does change things up a lot and yeah you don't really go

10:45.560 --> 10:49.200
out into this world map and go to towns and stuff like you do in a Final Fantasy

10:49.200 --> 10:52.680
game you didn't intend either if you think about it remember it was just the

10:52.680 --> 10:56.200
airship in different spots that you could kind of drop down into it was

10:56.200 --> 11:00.200
exactly these games are kind of like that to Lost Odyssey I there's a lot of

11:00.200 --> 11:03.920
I see in I mean besides the battle systems are completely different but

11:03.920 --> 11:06.840
like the way you move around the map and everything it's very similar to Lost

11:06.840 --> 11:10.680
Odyssey you know you have these relatively linear dungeons with

11:10.680 --> 11:14.320
different branches and so forth you know but Lost Odyssey didn't get a lot of

11:14.320 --> 11:19.360
crap but clearly Final Fantasy 13 is just have an idea what they think Final

11:19.360 --> 11:24.080
Fantasy should be and if it's not that then they're like oh it sucks really

11:24.080 --> 11:28.200
when you look at it it's exactly the same as all the other Final Fantasies so

11:28.200 --> 11:32.120
what so you don't have to wander around aimlessly in like some overworld for a

11:32.120 --> 11:35.840
while big deal tiger claw in our chat room chat that

11:35.840 --> 11:38.760
orange launcher dot-com says sky he would have to wash his talking about

11:38.760 --> 11:42.240
sass sky he would have to wash his hair every day though to clean out all the

11:42.240 --> 11:45.840
chocobo poo I do want to point out the chocobo is capable of flying out of the

11:45.840 --> 11:49.840
hair and you do see that happening so he hopefully is potty trained to know to

11:49.840 --> 11:53.360
fly out of the hair and go to like a nearby tree or something I don't really

11:53.360 --> 11:57.600
get into that and normally animals don't poop where they sleep you know just like

11:57.600 --> 12:02.080
just like to show me you know there's just some cases where you don't have to

12:02.080 --> 12:07.320
explain the bathroom thing like take 24 for example on the show 24 it's so fast

12:07.320 --> 12:10.160
paced and action paced you don't ever stop to really think when do these

12:10.160 --> 12:13.880
characters have time to poo when they're not when they're not showing them you

12:13.880 --> 12:18.080
know it's just like when it goes to some other character but these are things you

12:18.080 --> 12:21.680
do you don't think about because 24 is so action-packed and there's so much

12:21.680 --> 12:25.520
going on you're not supposed to be thinking about gee I wonder if Jack's

12:25.520 --> 12:32.560
gotta go anyhow is our all the scenes always focused on him what's that are

12:32.560 --> 12:37.400
all the scenes always focus no they're not so then he goes he pees well he's

12:37.400 --> 12:40.640
usually in situations where it's not like there's a bathroom nearby like when

12:40.640 --> 12:44.400
he's robbed depends when he's tied to a chair getting tortured depends all right

12:44.400 --> 12:47.800
forget it although that would be awesome to spend a whole episode based on you

12:47.800 --> 12:52.280
know him trying to find a bathroom no it would not be awesome actually canceled

12:52.280 --> 12:56.560
so oh well no NBC might buy it now that they have five hours available on week

12:56.560 --> 13:01.280
nights that's the rumor anyway it can just replace the site show with 24 is a

13:01.280 --> 13:04.240
great show although it's one of those shows where it's like I missed an

13:04.240 --> 13:07.560
episode so now I can't watch like any of it because you miss one you miss

13:07.560 --> 13:12.080
everything it's like lost like people just obsessed with lost and I get why

13:12.080 --> 13:18.800
there's a lot to it but but I again if you missed that first episode I think

13:18.800 --> 13:25.840
you're just lost period anyhow yeah yeah just like Brad from pod culture said he

13:25.840 --> 13:30.400
pees during the commercial break just like everybody else does liquid parrot

13:30.400 --> 13:33.520
and chat room ass I'm playing Final Fantasy 13 now I'm getting five stars

13:33.520 --> 13:37.920
after every battle but what's the point is there even exp in this game there is

13:37.920 --> 13:41.960
not exp but there's crystal points that let you move around the board similar to

13:41.960 --> 13:48.680
Final Fantasy tens level up system the stars I believe affect your loot you can

13:48.680 --> 13:52.960
sometimes get loot affected by the stars I think more importantly your technic

13:52.960 --> 13:56.080
points which I don't know if you're to the point in the game where you're using

13:56.080 --> 14:00.920
those yet but they allow you to cast spells like Libra you will see how that

14:00.920 --> 14:04.080
comes into play if you're not already there the star ratings affect how fast

14:04.080 --> 14:10.280
your bar fills up for technic points so there you go anyhow other games I think

14:10.280 --> 14:13.640
I mentioned Wow I'm playing Warcraft my boyfriend and I made it to Outlands on

14:13.640 --> 14:16.720
the characters we've been working on for a couple months so yay that and the

14:16.720 --> 14:20.680
Megaman 10 came out this week on PlayStation I didn't play it really a

14:20.680 --> 14:24.920
lot I just kind of downloaded it and went in and went ooh I pretty and and

14:24.920 --> 14:29.000
well not really pretty but retro tastic and and I went in and watched the

14:29.000 --> 14:32.240
replays oddly enough that was the first thing I did I went in to watch replays

14:32.240 --> 14:36.120
and watch people just do speed runs on these stages that are insane that's kind

14:36.120 --> 14:39.200
of a cool thing I don't remember if Megaman 9 had that if it did I just

14:39.200 --> 14:42.760
never looked for it but for some reason that jumped right out at me in this

14:42.760 --> 14:45.840
Megaman 10 and that was one of the first things I did so I need to play that a

14:45.840 --> 14:49.800
little more it's nice though that I can watch movies on how to beat stages when

14:49.800 --> 14:56.160
I don't know what to do so that was pretty much it for my gaming week let's

14:56.160 --> 15:01.640
go to some housekeeping Jamie you went to an event today where you played all

15:01.640 --> 15:04.480
these Atari games give us a little wrap-up on what this was all about I

15:04.480 --> 15:09.640
went to the Atari party 2010 which I guess I didn't really know about this

15:09.640 --> 15:15.760
before but apparently they do it every year and it was basically this kind of

15:15.760 --> 15:22.600
house like structure in Davis you had a kitchen and a big room but they just had

15:22.600 --> 15:30.000
Atari systems looked up everywhere and I met a man named Sal who you know I said

15:30.000 --> 15:34.640
I was gonna mention his thing but I put my piece of paper with everything on

15:34.640 --> 15:42.600
there mention it next week I will definitely make a big mention of it but

15:42.600 --> 15:51.600
it was really cool he does a lot of he did soundtracks for a lot of I guess new

15:51.600 --> 15:57.960
releases of our ports of other games you know or releases of prototypes and other

15:57.960 --> 16:02.720
ones like that right now they're working on outrun in space Harrier for a the

16:02.720 --> 16:10.760
Atari XL and the which is a computer version of the the 5200 it's funny his

16:10.760 --> 16:13.760
company's called Atlantis games if that was the name because Atlantis was one and

16:13.760 --> 16:16.720
I thought I looked it up on Wikipedia real quick just to jog my memory I

16:16.720 --> 16:20.520
thought Atlantis was one of those big big Atari 2600 games it was really well

16:20.520 --> 16:23.640
loved and yeah there's some screenshots here was that one of those a magic game

16:23.640 --> 16:27.000
so it had that very unique looking cartridge with like the orange that was

16:27.000 --> 16:31.040
a great 2600 game so I don't know if the company is named and owed to that game

16:31.040 --> 16:37.880
or what but that was one of the better 2600 games sorry so I actually um he

16:37.880 --> 16:43.760
played a lot of the it's just um some songs that he had done in that format

16:43.760 --> 16:48.360
though just for fun like axle F and Actraiser music and Mega Man and

16:48.360 --> 16:53.440
different stuff is actually pretty cool isn't amazing Castlevania any synth ask

16:53.440 --> 16:57.120
kind of system like you know whenever there's some type of Cynthia type sound

16:57.120 --> 17:03.320
involved always has axle F and somehow Van Halen's jump usually makes an

17:03.320 --> 17:09.600
appearance at some point to maybe he didn't do it but somebody did well at

17:09.600 --> 17:15.480
any rate they also had this is keeping my brain kind of fried from being out so

17:15.480 --> 17:22.080
long but they had the DVD game system you know how some of the DVDs for all

17:22.080 --> 17:26.000
they were doing like a game system hooked up to it so they had a version of

17:26.000 --> 17:31.440
tempest 3000 what I remember tempest 3000 yeah let me see if I can pull it up

17:31.440 --> 17:34.760
real quick was that what are those those like little joysticks you hook up to the

17:34.760 --> 17:44.320
television but yeah yeah I'm gonna find it interesting well okay so um tempest

17:44.320 --> 17:51.480
3000 and by the way it is gorgeous um it uh I'm trying to find what was on it was

17:51.480 --> 17:56.000
um because I obviously I remember to the new one the new one is what it is

17:56.000 --> 18:06.800
Wow um the it was a DVD a system that had enhanced DVD tools in it and 3d

18:06.800 --> 18:14.040
video game playability on it so uh only a few things came out on it but so far I

18:14.040 --> 18:18.880
think just tempest 3000 is the only real notable but they had one there and had

18:18.880 --> 18:23.720
it hooked up there's a link a picture of it to the chat room but that's uh it

18:23.720 --> 18:28.640
looks like an n64 that's what I first Wow that's coming in so I had looked at

18:28.640 --> 18:35.640
it and I was like oh no that's a new one yeah so um but I played tempest 3000 and

18:35.640 --> 18:40.000
there was actually some video up of Dan playing tempest 3000 because I recorded

18:40.000 --> 18:43.920
stuff with my iPhone Jordan on your YouTube it's on my YouTube right now so

18:43.920 --> 18:47.480
it's on your YouTube channel yeah I'm gonna give that out publicly or yeah

18:47.480 --> 18:52.640
it's all our dark Sakura or dark Sakura or something you know it can you find it

18:52.640 --> 19:01.560
Rob yeah um but uh I uh it's a lot of battery your dark Sakura or lr but yeah

19:01.560 --> 19:07.240
I did like a couple of sweeps of the party and you know just you know I took

19:07.240 --> 19:14.040
a few screens on here's tempest 3000 I want to kind of play this a little bit

19:14.040 --> 19:21.320
tempest 2000 but it plays on the laser the DVD players that have you on

19:22.360 --> 19:32.720
should I got you to put these on the olr YouTube that's all right I'm just

19:32.720 --> 19:35.680
trying to get a look at the game here it's sorry I know this doesn't mean for

19:35.680 --> 19:39.280
a great radio but yeah it's very blurry that's the problem with it this is an

19:39.280 --> 19:45.400
HDTV it would be a lot better but it's why I still say I prefer tempest 2000 to

19:45.400 --> 19:50.680
tempest 3000 because tempest 3000 gives me a headache the score is gigantic in

19:50.680 --> 19:54.960
the corner that's kind of the music's the same

19:57.960 --> 20:03.640
Wow almost makes me wanna see a new one get added to the gaming vault I can't

20:03.640 --> 20:08.480
imagine if I could find one I'm sure they're pretty expensive very cool all

20:08.480 --> 20:13.160
right so sorry I was not aware of tempest 3000 yes I would say it's one of

20:13.160 --> 20:16.160
those things I've heard of before but I just really haven't seen emotions I've

20:16.160 --> 20:20.040
covered it I've covered it when I was covered tempest yeah but it's it's one

20:20.040 --> 20:24.480
of those hearing about it and seeing it or and playing it are three different

20:24.480 --> 20:28.200
things there were you know there were Jaguars all over the place and you know

20:28.200 --> 20:36.040
all varieties of Atari systems it was pretty fun it was pretty fun and I'm

20:36.040 --> 20:43.920
actually thinking I'll find the stuff a little bit later for everybody but the

20:43.920 --> 20:49.320
the guy I talked to has an eBay store and he sells the refurbished excels for

20:49.320 --> 20:54.760
like 70 bucks which isn't bad because you know they're all you know set up to

20:54.760 --> 21:02.560
work with s video so and you know he sells most of cartridges that they do

21:02.560 --> 21:05.960
for like 30 bucks I mean it is you know time and effort went into it is pretty

21:05.960 --> 21:10.720
much a new version of the game except he did tempest extreme well they did tempest

21:10.720 --> 21:16.000
extreme that because of how much work and everything that went into getting it

21:16.000 --> 21:21.820
to run properly it's actually a 50 buck game but I've seen it in motion played

21:21.820 --> 21:27.940
it well worth it so it was pretty good all right the Atari party a little local

21:27.940 --> 21:33.340
event sounds like a PlayStation there and I was like hey you're at the Atari

21:33.340 --> 21:36.220
party or were they playing the Atari collection maybe on the PlayStation

21:36.220 --> 21:40.420
night that might be so no I just heard the little PlayStation chime and I was

21:40.420 --> 21:46.880
like hey that doesn't belong here you get that or you get that out oh and um

21:46.880 --> 21:52.720
they also had one of the mountain you know ran into Neil there mm-hmm and I

21:52.720 --> 21:57.560
didn't get to see it he cuz I was talking to the the XL the guy had south

21:57.560 --> 22:00.440
we were talking about the music and everything by the way since I don't

22:00.440 --> 22:03.600
think Neil's ever been on this program he's no buddy of mine from like junior

22:03.600 --> 22:07.120
high school we've known each other a very long time and so he goes some of

22:07.120 --> 22:11.440
these nerd things too yeah you he also does rocky a big part of that and is a

22:11.440 --> 22:23.080
big nerd so he also gave me that I'm act that's collecting dust under the pinball table but the crap he told me that they had

22:23.080 --> 22:30.400
choo-choo rocket on one of on the the you know I'm gonna see what what it is

22:30.400 --> 22:33.680
oh what are the Atari systems like somebody poured in it yeah no Wow I'm

22:33.680 --> 22:38.040
seeing what it was I just you know completely unplugged my phone sorry on a

22:38.040 --> 22:45.440
1040 Wow so that's pretty cool lots of retro love people still making new games

22:45.440 --> 22:50.320
on old systems it's kind of funny and yes Amiga 777 it was a Jaguar someone

22:50.320 --> 22:55.280
had Jaguar CD hooked up to iron soldier was one of the engineer playing so I was

22:55.280 --> 23:02.160

Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 6 versus Ocarina of Time I'm pretty sure

23:44.160 --> 23:49.360
yes Chrono Trigger versus Lake of the past and Ocarina of Time versus Final

23:49.360 --> 23:54.120

23:54.120 --> 24:00.560
matchups are incredibly close so be sure to get your votes in tonight if you're

24:00.560 --> 24:04.960

24:04.960 --> 24:09.400
because the final matchup will be coming this week and we will have a new winner

24:09.400 --> 24:14.440
of the madness tournament for more information once again log on to www.

24:14.440 --> 24:19.160
orange lounge radio.com and click on forums talk to you guys later bye bye

24:19.160 --> 24:23.160
very interesting matchup in the final four is it to Zelda games somehow made

24:23.160 --> 24:28.280
it to the final four but Final Fantasy 6 is up against Ocarina of Time got to

24:28.280 --> 24:31.520
tell you my vote went to Final Fantasy 6 that's that's one of my favorite Final

24:31.520 --> 24:35.720
Fantasy is probably I don't know if I do I would give it the six to I and don't

24:35.720 --> 24:39.720
get me wrong I realize I've said my piece on Ocarina of Time and it's still

24:39.720 --> 24:43.480
a great great great game but Final Fantasy 6 is like a great great great

24:43.480 --> 24:47.920
great great game the other matchup is Link to the Past versus Chrono Trigger I

24:47.920 --> 24:51.880
personally voted for Link to the Past but I know of course Chrono Trigger has

24:51.880 --> 24:56.040
this extremely loyal fan base I really wouldn't be surprised to see that win

24:56.040 --> 25:00.120
although what you know Link to the Past if I had a Super Nintendo sitting in

25:00.120 --> 25:03.080
front of me and both of those carts I'd reach for Link to the Past I would I

25:03.080 --> 25:06.640
would probably play through more of that one sitting than I could Chrono Trigger

25:06.640 --> 25:10.920
too but anyway it doesn't really matter what I think it's what you guys think so

25:10.920 --> 25:13.800
go check that out in our forums we'll have more updates on the winner and if

25:13.800 --> 25:16.520
you don't like the games that are there we'll poo on you you should have been

25:16.520 --> 25:20.800
voting or sending your top 25 list like we told you to like couple months ago so

25:20.800 --> 25:23.120
if you missed your chance this year don't worry you have get to do it all

25:23.120 --> 25:30.960
again next year all right um let's see SHA100 Matt in our chat says Ocarina

25:30.960 --> 25:35.200
isn't a Link to the Past that's true but Link to the Past did have an Ocarina in

25:35.200 --> 25:38.480
it if I remember right didn't it wasn't it one of the early ones where you at

25:38.480 --> 25:41.280
least it had like a whistle type thing like some sort of whistle that looked

25:41.280 --> 25:44.080
like an Ocarina it's kind of like a really really old

25:44.080 --> 25:48.380
integration of that anyhow let's get into some actual gaming news what is

25:48.380 --> 25:52.280
going on new in the world obviously lots and lots happened this week we gave

25:52.280 --> 25:57.280
developers conference but first some other big news that wasn't from GDC

25:57.280 --> 26:02.880
right Loki yeah there's and this isn't too surprising just you know from their

26:02.880 --> 26:07.760
track record of what's been released recently but apparently Majesco is kind

26:07.760 --> 26:12.680
of going the way of Midway and Atari where it's now being threatened by

26:12.680 --> 26:18.360
Nasdaq with a delisting apparently again this is not the first time that

26:18.360 --> 26:23.520
this has happened the company now has 180 calendar days to bring its stock a

26:23.520 --> 26:28.960
price above $1 per share the minimum required to remain on the exchange the

26:28.960 --> 26:36.320
trick is though that they can't it it can't just pop up it's a fiscally or

26:36.320 --> 26:41.720
fiscally hurting head above a bucket for a day and everything will be good you

26:41.720 --> 26:47.480
know fine it has to stay above the $1 mark I guess for a minimum of 10

26:47.480 --> 26:55.880
consecutive trading days prior to August 30th 2010 now if you think about it

26:55.880 --> 27:01.280
Majesco hasn't released much for a while I mean you're really there big franchise

27:01.280 --> 27:06.520
right now is cooking mama and cooking mama's what like gardening mama and I

27:06.520 --> 27:10.960
mean they've kind of dug that into the ground haven't they yeah I mean it's

27:10.960 --> 27:15.040
they've got a few games coming out of like there's a Pirates of plunder are

27:15.040 --> 27:19.640
supposed to be coming out soon but I mean come on between Pirates of plunder

27:19.640 --> 27:23.440
flips twisted world you know a bunch of these secondary titles there for the Wii

27:23.440 --> 27:30.280
and yes I just don't I don't really see this happening I mean they don't have a

27:30.280 --> 27:37.360
date they put out the mad dog McCree pack on Wii oh whoa well I guess I'm

27:37.360 --> 27:42.800
wrong I know exactly yeah I'm looking at the list of Majesco stuff and I'm kind

27:42.800 --> 27:46.560
of like oh boy oh there's I mean they have the Teen Titans license which I'm

27:46.560 --> 27:49.920
sure sell some games I mean I'm not I'm not really they haven't used they

27:49.920 --> 27:55.440
haven't put I haven't done in a while a few years they have a Texas Hold'em game

27:55.440 --> 28:01.960
on DS but those are a dime it does those are like years old okay stray the blood

28:01.960 --> 28:05.720
rain games but again those are kind of old news they haven't been doing a no

28:05.720 --> 28:11.000
they've only really been doing like DS and Wii titles and they've been very

28:11.000 --> 28:15.640
secondary I'm sorry to say I mean like like I said the last few games have come

28:15.640 --> 28:24.240
out from them okay Data East arcade classics collection yeah that's a nice

28:24.240 --> 28:28.560
collection of games but it's not gonna sell like the the copies that they need

28:28.560 --> 28:35.440
the make money I mean it's just no triple-a title or even really a titles a

28:35.440 --> 28:40.320
lot of let me a lot of seat on this way like a company in like 505 games I mean

28:40.320 --> 28:46.120
they're like pretty brand-new I mean they're relatively new like a few years

28:46.120 --> 28:51.080
old and they put out a lot of crap but they're putting out more games and these

28:51.080 --> 28:54.600
guys are and they actually have some decent titles coming up that are pretty

28:54.600 --> 28:57.480
notable like naughty bear or something like that well they may not also be

28:57.480 --> 29:00.960
traded on the stock market either keep in mind that we're not talking about if

29:00.960 --> 29:04.520
they get delisted from the stock market they're gonna just go under immediately

29:04.520 --> 29:08.880
although that's although that's a side effect yeah but it well it's our

29:08.880 --> 29:13.920
Atari's still kicking I mean not as much as they used to but they're kicking

29:13.920 --> 29:19.480
they're kicking with the float even there you know kickboard but it's just

29:19.480 --> 29:24.360
it's not what it was I mean Midway they went under and all their assets got

29:24.360 --> 29:28.480
bought out Majesco I could see that happening I mean you know gardening mama

29:28.480 --> 29:32.360
that could be something or like you know the cooking mama series that could be

29:32.360 --> 29:36.400
something that probably fit with like Ubisoft even SSJ 100 Matt makes an

29:36.400 --> 29:39.560
excellent point in our chat room chat that orange on city.com they should have

29:39.560 --> 29:43.480
brought president cat over before they go under because president cat would be

29:43.480 --> 29:49.040
a triple-a title indeed it would hold out hope for e3 at

29:49.040 --> 29:54.080
Majesco's booth you never know you never know if president cat does show up at e3

29:54.080 --> 29:57.680
I will be going over to the booth of the person who had the balls to put it out

29:57.680 --> 30:01.440
saying would you like to shake my hand

30:01.440 --> 30:08.880
I'd be all sorts of like crazy oh by the way and it you know like they did with

30:08.880 --> 30:13.920
any three last year in Nintendo's press conference oh by the way here's a

30:13.920 --> 30:20.480
Metroid other M trailer it's like oh by the way I think we have a candidate for

30:20.480 --> 30:24.880
a perfect title this holiday season this election season we have the candidate

30:24.880 --> 30:31.920
for you I would just I'd lose it I would all right yeah I'd be on the floor

30:31.920 --> 30:37.160
shaking and crying all right now all right for real though other stuff going

30:37.160 --> 30:43.200
on quaking in your mantis I would I would anyhow PlayStation move was

30:43.200 --> 30:46.320
revealed this week a game developers conference I'm sure any of you guys that

30:46.320 --> 30:49.960
actively follow the gaming blogs have heard about this it's not the arc or

30:49.960 --> 30:53.640
anything like that it is the PlayStation move is the name of the controller and

30:53.640 --> 30:58.800
it made its debut at GDC they are promising that it will launch for less

30:58.800 --> 31:05.520
than $100 which means like what $99 right $99.99 $99 and then there's been a

31:05.520 --> 31:10.840
lot of the little thing that they were doing their conference talking about so

31:10.840 --> 31:15.680
calm for because so calm is going to be the big franchise that gets the support

31:15.680 --> 31:20.600
of PlayStation move this year and they were cut I noticed they went out of

31:20.600 --> 31:26.200
their way to say look how you don't go flailing about like you know they really

31:26.200 --> 31:29.560
kind of tried to poke fun at the weed very subtly they said notice how he's

31:29.560 --> 31:33.500
not flailing about he made these very subtle motions and I gotta say granted

31:33.500 --> 31:36.960
I'm not a so calm player so I didn't really know what to look for but you

31:36.960 --> 31:39.920
could see the dude sitting there and if it was a live demo which I have no

31:39.920 --> 31:44.640
reason to doubt that it was it looked pretty yeah he's just kind of using it

31:44.640 --> 31:49.640
as a another way to control the game that's just like you know the Call of

31:49.640 --> 31:55.240
Duty games that are on the Wii I mean it's it can be done I mean you can just

31:55.240 --> 32:00.000
use the the one controller as a pointer and then the other one the kind of

32:00.000 --> 32:05.360
control your movements and then maybe throw in some different like motion

32:05.360 --> 32:08.960
sensitive commands that you can do for different things well I know they were

32:08.960 --> 32:13.080
trying to really make it a point to to say look at the precision this thing has

32:13.080 --> 32:17.200
great precision this is a precise controller like they were really trying

32:17.200 --> 32:20.760
to take a jab at the fact that the we can sometimes be a little all over the

32:20.760 --> 32:24.680
place and I do agree it's probably gonna be more precise but because they've had

32:24.680 --> 32:29.920
more time to perfect the technology exactly but I mean from what they're

32:29.920 --> 32:34.640
showings were of what they're gonna be putting out come on you're not that much

32:34.640 --> 32:40.360
better than Nintendo like for example iPad well okay iPad you know and now we

32:40.360 --> 32:44.920
finally understand why that title is delayed forever and and that's kind of

32:44.920 --> 32:49.120
neat it's different because it's a little bit of augmented reality stuff in

32:49.120 --> 32:55.920
there but mainly I was saying you know move party come on oh great more party

32:55.920 --> 32:59.360
game collections yeah it's like you know what though if that's what sells that's

32:59.360 --> 33:02.880
what sells no no no and I don't have a problem with them doing that because

33:02.880 --> 33:06.920
it's kind of neat to see like you know that kind of a party game with actually

33:06.920 --> 33:11.840
good graphics in it you know what I mean and it would be neat if they actually

33:11.840 --> 33:16.080
figure out unique ways to do this but do they've got an archery game in there

33:16.080 --> 33:22.880
it's just like the fucking archery game and we sports you know resort HD oh who

33:22.880 --> 33:25.960
cares well to be fair there's a Lord of the Rings game coming to for what it's

33:25.960 --> 33:31.400
worth that's a port of a Wii game and looks like it and then they do they did

33:31.400 --> 33:34.960
make sure to stress that they had so many companies behind it like they

33:34.960 --> 33:38.520
showed a slide where there was just logos all over pretty much all their

33:38.520 --> 33:43.080
big publishers are jumping on board with move somehow which isn't too big of a

33:43.080 --> 33:47.440
surprise honestly it'll just be interesting to see if there's that must

33:47.440 --> 33:51.880
have game there's that must-have game that really sells the move I don't know

33:51.880 --> 33:56.000
if so com4 is it I mean so com4 don't get me wrong so com4 there's a lot of

33:56.000 --> 33:59.680
so com fans and especially because they they've made it a point to say you don't

33:59.680 --> 34:02.600
have to use move you don't want it was just you know something that's there too

34:02.600 --> 34:07.080
exactly and I like how they do have the option there and options are good I'm

34:07.080 --> 34:10.480
surprised Sony's jumping on that bandwagon because you know that wasn't

34:10.480 --> 34:13.760
really something that was their mantra but so calm isn't really that title that

34:13.760 --> 34:17.880
has crossed the line to get everybody interested including the soccer moms

34:17.880 --> 34:20.720
which are important because it's their credit card usually with the kids you

34:20.720 --> 34:26.800
know it'll be neat just I think the PlayStation moves like the move party

34:26.800 --> 34:32.720
stuff will be okay especially if they're gonna bundle that with the software but

34:32.720 --> 34:39.360
my thing is though too is you gotta buy you know at least one of these is gonna

34:39.360 --> 34:42.960
come with your kit or whatever that's gonna have the camera which I don't even

34:42.960 --> 34:47.800
really need this because I have the camera already okay so you have to buy

34:47.800 --> 34:51.200
one of those controllers which let's assume it's the same price as you know

34:51.200 --> 34:56.180
the Wii the Wii remotes like 40 bucks okay well those things they have two of

34:56.180 --> 34:59.980
them they have one that's kind of like a nunchuck type of controller air sub

34:59.980 --> 35:03.840
controller whatever that looks exactly the same I have a feeling it's gonna be

35:03.840 --> 35:09.000
another $40 okay so great I have you an $80 set of controllers here that's for

35:09.000 --> 35:15.400
one player now I need it for the other three Oh goody so there you know what

35:15.400 --> 35:19.640
you've spent a good 200 you know three hundred and twenty dollars on fucking

35:19.640 --> 35:23.720
controllers dark soccer oh what are your thoughts on move what's with the light

35:23.720 --> 35:28.080
bulb I think isn't it like be able to see the different players and where they

35:28.080 --> 35:31.560
are in the room type of thing um that and because it's something that the

35:31.560 --> 35:35.840
camera can track oh yeah cuz it's all camera that's why they have LED thing

35:35.840 --> 35:39.400
little like glowing balls on like people when they're motion capturing them and

35:39.400 --> 35:44.640
stuff like that hmm I don't know again I'm kind of torn like I'm I look at

35:44.640 --> 35:48.520
PlayStation move and I go oh okay neat I like what Sony's doing with that but

35:48.520 --> 35:52.000
then I look at it and go yeah but there's nothing I there's nothing that's

35:52.000 --> 35:55.340
gonna make me run out and buy this day one right now you know again I'm not

35:55.340 --> 35:59.300
really the SOCOM fan that doesn't really speak to me I don't know these minigame

35:59.300 --> 36:02.680
collections don't look anything better than the Wii except maybe the graphics

36:02.680 --> 36:05.520
there's nothing that makes me go OMG got to get one of these day one here's the

36:05.520 --> 36:09.260
problem is that they haven't figured out why they're not selling as well that's

36:09.260 --> 36:12.260
really what it comes down to is they think oh my god it's because you know

36:12.260 --> 36:16.700
this other console has motion sensitive stuff that's why it's selling well no

36:16.700 --> 36:20.080
it's because it has casual games and games that feel the family so that's why

36:20.080 --> 36:24.480
it's selling well I just think it's too little too late you think they're

36:24.480 --> 36:30.000
jumping into this too late heck yeah hmm I mean I think that the Microsoft has

36:30.000 --> 36:34.440
the better idea you know well basically what they're trying to do with this is

36:34.440 --> 36:39.040
that they're trying to put it themselves on equal footing with the Nintendo Wii

36:39.040 --> 36:43.000
and basically then it's gonna be okay look these both of these systems have

36:43.000 --> 36:48.000
you in the motion technology now let's compare the rest of the features and

36:48.000 --> 36:51.600
when you compare the rest of the features the we just looks like

36:51.600 --> 36:55.240
something for the last generation minute this thing comes out there will be that

36:55.240 --> 36:58.720
bundle that includes move that they're really gonna be pushing the holiday

36:58.720 --> 37:04.200
season hey it's a blu-ray and a we type thing in one that's that's what it is

37:04.200 --> 37:09.560
that's Sony's strategy I'm sure it does everything it only does everything

37:09.560 --> 37:15.160
except but to be fair I mean Sony's made a lot of made a lot of ground in the

37:15.160 --> 37:19.320
past couple years I mean I think they've got to do this they're so way behind in

37:19.320 --> 37:23.880
the numbers and it's it's a good idea but here's the other thing even with

37:23.880 --> 37:27.800
the toll the toll is going to be the same problem I think and even to a

37:27.800 --> 37:31.360
greater extent at least with the tall and I'll give them credit for this at

37:31.360 --> 37:36.280
least in the tall I don't the fucking buy $320 with the controllers it's the

37:36.280 --> 37:41.000
camera that's it done I don't have to make any more fucking purchases at all

37:41.000 --> 37:44.800
well speaking of the tall I think dark soccer has got a story for us that kind

37:44.800 --> 37:48.600
of talks about Microsoft although they didn't they didn't get to do the keynote

37:48.600 --> 37:52.960
at GDC if that doesn't mean there's no news on the tall well um they're

37:52.960 --> 37:58.440
basically stating that they're gonna have the full lineup of the natal titles

37:58.440 --> 38:04.760
at e3 which will be cool of course they've got EA Capcom turn 10 spawn

38:04.760 --> 38:10.720
point behind them and that they are quote putting their best people on the

38:10.720 --> 38:18.520
on the job so uh they should actually be seeing some pretty good stuff this June

38:18.520 --> 38:23.120
what big Xbox franchise do you think might natal be I mean I guess we've

38:23.120 --> 38:26.720
heard fable already yeah my thought and I remember making this prediction earlier

38:26.720 --> 38:29.400
in the year and I don't remember if it was on the show or on one of the forums

38:29.400 --> 38:34.280
or what have you but I remember saying I think Gears of War 3 is gonna be

38:34.280 --> 38:38.400
unveiled at e3 and it's gonna have natal support and it's kind of funny that

38:38.400 --> 38:42.960
SOCOM showed up with the PlayStation move because when I saw that I was like

38:42.960 --> 38:47.720
wow that's kind of that's kind of close ish that's like Playstations kind of

38:47.720 --> 38:52.600
sudary type game as long as they take a mature approach with it like you know

38:52.600 --> 38:58.000
where it's it makes sense for the game not just it seems tacked on as long as

38:58.000 --> 39:02.400
they layling about like an idiot but they they Sony made a big point to say

39:02.400 --> 39:06.320
you will not flail around like an idiot so if they do it right again I'm talking

39:06.320 --> 39:10.720
out my ass it just seems like it's odd to me we have heard nothing about Gears

39:10.720 --> 39:16.080
of War 3 I have this strange feeling you know it's gonna happen those games are

39:16.080 --> 39:20.240
huge sellers I have this strange feeling that's the elephant behind the curtain

39:20.240 --> 39:23.400
that's gonna show at e3 when dark soccer talks about they're bringing all their

39:23.400 --> 39:28.580
natal titles I my gut tells me that's one of them oh I'm also though looking

39:28.580 --> 39:31.320
in terms of course there's gonna be sports games that are gonna use it

39:31.320 --> 39:35.120
although I would like to see how it would work with like a racing game if it

39:35.120 --> 39:39.100
would be something like you foresee you know what I mean well I think they

39:39.100 --> 39:42.020
showed in one of those previews right somebody was like grabbing us I think

39:42.020 --> 39:45.240
there was like a racing game you see the little happy family grabbing a steering

39:45.240 --> 39:50.120
wheel yeah you know natal I'm approaching with this big grain of salt

39:50.120 --> 39:55.280
as to how well it's actually gonna work because I go I feel like it's like the

39:55.280 --> 40:00.480
PlayStation I now granted the or not the I the I toy sorry granted the

40:00.480 --> 40:03.480
technologies come a long way in the past few years I just really hope we see that

40:03.480 --> 40:09.880
and I hope at e3 they show natal in a realistic environment and not against a

40:09.880 --> 40:13.600
really well-lit white wall although you know that's what they're gonna do so

40:13.600 --> 40:17.320
that it's super uber responsive because part of me is like how's this really

40:17.320 --> 40:21.520
gonna work in my living room I want them to do it in front of a big red wall or

40:21.520 --> 40:25.440
something or what a tacky curtain out of the 1970s I could see in my house or

40:25.440 --> 40:31.600
like remember the we demo stations I had up at e3 that year with the couch mm-hmm

40:31.600 --> 40:34.720
they just made little living rooms why don't they do something like that I'm

40:34.720 --> 40:38.520
hoping that's what we see again I don't know e3 is a couple months away I don't

40:38.520 --> 40:42.520
even know if I'm going at this point to be honest I want to go but I want to but

40:42.520 --> 40:49.360
I have other priorities this year yeah not this year I just really the only

40:49.360 --> 40:52.360
thing that I think right now is an advantage for them is that I don't buy

40:52.360 --> 40:56.400
extra accessories because really that's gonna be just like and that's gonna be

40:56.400 --> 41:01.760
a big I hope they push that it's okay hey look you gotta buy $320 worth of

41:01.760 --> 41:05.400
crap and granted I'm throwing these numbers out my ass but I mean look at

41:05.400 --> 41:14.480
the we lesser technology same price you know I gotta buy all this kind of extra

41:14.480 --> 41:20.800
stuff to get to work versus its camera it's done you just plug it and go you

41:20.800 --> 41:26.280
are the controller you know that's it but then again since I am the controller

41:26.280 --> 41:32.080
I can only see ridiculous shit happening with that setup because they're gonna

41:32.080 --> 41:35.120
make you flail around they're gonna make you do stupid shit that's unnecessary

41:35.120 --> 41:40.400
just like those stupid little concept demo videos that they had where people

41:40.400 --> 41:47.280
are screwing in nuts on a fucking tire in a race or something like that it's

41:47.280 --> 41:53.120
unnecessary but they think of some really cool ways to like you know play

41:53.120 --> 41:59.200
first-person shooters somehow more power to them I will see a little ways off but

41:59.200 --> 42:02.240
again I think Microsoft's gonna have that same approach to Sony come the

42:02.240 --> 42:06.120
holiday season now it's the Xbox 360 with in the tall or whatever they call

42:06.120 --> 42:10.200
it I mean it's not gonna mean it's all I it's not gonna be that either it's kind

42:10.200 --> 42:12.720
of weird they still have not announced the name but I guess like you know they

42:12.720 --> 42:16.640
could still do it at e3 announce the name until they announce name it's funny

42:16.640 --> 42:20.840
GDC I get it but but he threes it's fun up a little why they named it moved

42:20.840 --> 42:24.680
right because they couldn't get the trademark for arc well really yeah who

42:24.680 --> 42:29.080
had a trademark uh there's some some issue with them not being able to get

42:29.080 --> 42:32.960
you get the trademark so they have to go with move instead I think PlayStation

42:32.960 --> 42:36.960
moves a better name just from the because their logo still the arc but

42:36.960 --> 42:42.680
it's an a looking thing I kind of think it's the better name for the mass market

42:42.680 --> 42:47.120
I think a lot of other but then again what do I know the we what a dumb name

42:47.120 --> 42:51.960
that was and yet it worked I tend to strategy why it worked I know simple

42:51.960 --> 42:57.880
easy to remember easy market they made they made it into a adjective for games

42:57.880 --> 43:03.400
like to Xerox something or to get a Kleenex they made the we just like how

43:03.400 --> 43:07.720
people used to say oh we know we isn't we is not a generic yet no I know it's

43:07.720 --> 43:12.200
not a generic but it's that got that household recognition it'd be like

43:12.200 --> 43:19.680
bounty for paper towels all right let's move on with some more gaming news that

43:19.680 --> 43:25.200
maybe don't involve motion well it might but we never know oh that's true that's

43:25.200 --> 43:30.080
true that was something they're talking about but apparently though it has been

43:30.080 --> 43:35.920
announced that Rockman 3 will be making its way out this holiday season not a

43:35.920 --> 43:40.600
big surprise I mean they took kind of a year off file that next to duh and of

43:40.600 --> 43:45.520
course yeah so I'll be out this this holiday season of course they said

43:45.520 --> 43:49.200
that's going to innovate and then revolutionize the music genre once again

43:49.200 --> 43:53.320
obviously they're gonna be adding of course you know the three-part harmonies

43:53.320 --> 43:58.280
in there again in fact another game that will feature said three-part harmonies

43:58.280 --> 44:03.200
is also Green Day Rock Band which has now been announced to be releasing on

44:03.200 --> 44:10.440
June 8th worldwide also on the three major platforms Xbox 360 ps3 and we and

44:10.440 --> 44:15.120
it's of course we'll use up to six players three mics three instruments and

44:15.120 --> 44:22.600
they will also have apparently the ability to import the tracks as well or

44:22.600 --> 44:27.760
export the tracks in the Rock Band 2 as well there's gonna be all 47 tracks that

44:27.760 --> 44:33.000
are in the game will be exportable for I guess 10 bucks so it's basically

44:33.000 --> 44:37.880
Beatles Rock Band but now with I'm day and you can export the tracks I don't

44:37.880 --> 44:42.920
even see it as this this release to me is not even as big as Beatles Rock Band

44:42.920 --> 44:48.080
I think this is more like guitar your own Metallica but at least you can

44:48.080 --> 44:52.800
export the tracks can't do that shit with Metallica or Beatles or Van Halen

44:52.800 --> 44:57.080
yeah or reels but Beatles that was a different situation it was kind of

44:57.080 --> 45:01.200
Beatles are in a little category of their own to you know it Beatles is

45:01.200 --> 45:04.160
there there's not a lot of bands that can get away with just being in their

45:04.160 --> 45:08.240
own bubble the music game genre but Beatles can Green Day don't think

45:08.240 --> 45:11.200
they're there yet but this this is this will be nice for them they have I mean

45:11.200 --> 45:15.120
they have a lot of easily recognizable songs that you know I think the export

45:15.120 --> 45:20.360
feature will be very popular too yeah and also they said that there's gonna be

45:20.360 --> 45:27.320
a special edition Green Day Rock Band Plus that will come as to Xbox 360 and

45:27.320 --> 45:33.440
ps3 for $69.99 includes fancier packaging and an export feature I guess

45:33.440 --> 45:37.400
a voucher to export the discs to the hard drive and six previously released

45:37.400 --> 45:43.360
Green Day DLC tracks um at depth in our chat room chat that owners on trading

45:43.360 --> 45:46.920
com says also George Harrison's son already said that there would be a rock

45:46.920 --> 45:51.080
band 3 and it will help you learn to play real instruments wouldn't that be

45:51.080 --> 45:55.960
interesting if that's kind of the tie-in is is more making it real I don't know I

45:55.960 --> 46:01.320
part of me says maybe there should be a new instrument but then I think it came

46:01.320 --> 46:04.720
up a couple months ago on the show I think the idea had come up that maybe

46:04.720 --> 46:08.560
what rock band 3 is gonna introduce is something like the sing star space where

46:08.560 --> 46:13.280
you upload your own stuff to like a youtubey type of site I my gut tells me

46:13.280 --> 46:17.080
that's gonna be rock band threes thing especially with the network taking off

46:17.080 --> 46:22.160
as it is and so forth I think rock band 3 is gonna be really about now you can

46:22.160 --> 46:25.920
watch your friends rock out from you know across the country all I gotta say

46:25.920 --> 46:30.760
man is by the time that comes out I mean it's ridiculous the amount of tracks you

46:30.760 --> 46:35.000
can have you can have like about over a thousand tracks right now that are in

46:35.000 --> 46:39.800
that game I mean that's the way you do a music game right there you have the

46:39.800 --> 46:43.360
download content I mean literally there's a whole library of stuff to pick

46:43.360 --> 46:47.160
from and you can just take keep taking it with you through each and you know

46:47.160 --> 46:52.480
reiteration of the game all right well moving on to other news kind of a

46:52.480 --> 46:55.320
follow-up to last week you know obviously last week we had a very fun

46:55.320 --> 46:58.640
show here at olr while the Oscars were going on but something else that was

46:58.640 --> 47:02.800
going on at the time was that Ubisoft games were unplayable because they're

47:02.800 --> 47:07.920
their whole service was down and apparently and I think I had suggested

47:07.920 --> 47:13.440
this when somebody said it on the show it was indeed a DOS attack it sounds

47:13.440 --> 47:17.240
like hackers went in servers were attacked which limited service from 2

47:17.240 --> 47:23.880
30 p.m. to 9 p.m. Paris time 8 30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Eastern that was announced by by

47:23.880 --> 47:27.880
the company on their Twitter so of course they wanted to cover their tracks

47:27.880 --> 47:31.800
real quick saying oh but yeah most players 95% of players they weren't

47:31.800 --> 47:35.160
affected yeah because most people were still sleeping on the west coast at that

47:35.160 --> 47:39.360
time but still no I mean in all seriousness they tried to cover

47:39.360 --> 47:43.360
themselves saying a bunch of players weren't affected probably because they

47:43.360 --> 47:49.000
didn't try to play the game but again just kind of goes to show how their DRM

47:49.000 --> 47:52.320
system is ridiculous and was already cracked as we talked about last week

47:52.320 --> 47:57.160
correct yes because there's the code in there that very similar to steam if

47:57.160 --> 48:00.280
steam ever goes bankrupt which I don't think they're going to anytime soon no

48:00.280 --> 48:03.720
steam were to ever go under all those games would have to be activated without

48:03.720 --> 48:08.280
steam's presence and Ubisoft's games have something similar someone found it

48:08.280 --> 48:14.680
and went and unlock that for everybody hey what's this button do ah there it is

48:14.680 --> 48:19.200
togak in our chat room says haha I hope they get DDoS more so they learn their

48:19.200 --> 48:24.040
lesson I don't know if I'm really an advocate of DDoS thing but I think this

48:24.040 --> 48:27.840
certainly shows the weakness of why this should have never been done in the first

48:27.840 --> 48:36.520
place yep ah well how about something that's a little bit less irritating what

48:36.520 --> 48:42.040
do you think Rob sure Akira Yomoka huh he's good to hear about him he is the

48:42.040 --> 48:46.120
less irritating what's he up to lately I it's nice to hear him on a video game

48:46.120 --> 48:49.640
podcast because you know when he left Konami there was a little worried that

48:49.640 --> 48:53.520
oh he's leaving to go start a band or do something not to do with games

48:53.520 --> 48:58.160
whatsoever we did a panel at game developers conference that I'm talking

48:58.160 --> 49:05.000
about as long as audio is fun the game will be too that's what it was called but

49:05.000 --> 49:11.960
he was talking about how the audio how the music goes into provoking a certain

49:11.960 --> 49:18.440
emotion like it one of the examples given is that if you sync the sound just

49:18.440 --> 49:22.880
off by a few frames of animation that like if you do it beforehand it'll give

49:22.880 --> 49:27.360
a tone of anxiety to it but if you do it afterwards it's more comforting like

49:27.360 --> 49:31.760
starting the sound of footsteps just a fraction of you know a moment before the

49:31.760 --> 49:35.880
the action happens on the scene and they're talking about the use of silence

49:35.880 --> 49:41.600
and he's quoted as saying when there's no sound the brain fills in the gap and

49:41.600 --> 49:48.320
then actually went to play you know some music with with gaps of silence and then

49:48.320 --> 49:53.040
went back in and added sharp sounds to it of course which freaked people out but

49:53.040 --> 49:57.880
it was I think it's very effective and then he played some guitar for everybody

49:57.880 --> 50:02.440
to chill him out I could see that because that's kind of silent Hills

50:02.440 --> 50:05.160
thing is that sometimes it'll be very quiet when you're walking around all you

50:05.160 --> 50:09.120
hear those footsteps that I'm sure are off sync like he talks about there you

50:09.120 --> 50:11.680
walk around with the footsteps and all of a sudden you start hearing the radio

50:11.680 --> 50:14.480
noise the very uncomfortable kind of noise and that's how you know something's

50:14.480 --> 50:18.760
up interesting to kind of hear the science behind that it's it's it's

50:18.760 --> 50:25.400
simple psychology I mean they even you know I remember back in the day when I

50:25.400 --> 50:32.480
took music theory they were talking about the use of sharp dissonance or how

50:32.480 --> 50:37.560
about are setting things in a certain key like setting thing if I remember

50:37.560 --> 50:42.000
correctly setting things in the key of E is actually a very uncomfortable key to

50:42.000 --> 50:48.120
listen to things in I mean the setting and see very neutral you know same type

50:48.120 --> 50:52.880
of thing Wow there's a whole science behind it no word though about sadly

50:52.880 --> 50:56.240
what he's working on now or what have you you know I was it wasn't there some

50:56.240 --> 50:59.840
rumor something came up a while back that he was in cahoots with EA doing

50:59.840 --> 51:02.960
something I want to say something had come up on the show like a while ago

51:02.960 --> 51:08.400
maybe one of the chatters wants to fill in I seriously think though we haven't

51:08.400 --> 51:17.800
heard on the article though yeah very cool all right let's travel around the

51:17.800 --> 51:21.200
world and look at some release dates and what's coming out to a video game store

51:21.200 --> 51:26.000
near you that maybe won't make you so uncomfortable well these games make me

51:26.000 --> 51:30.200
uncomfortable because I can't believe that they're still being made well

51:30.200 --> 51:34.080
technically this is not really a new game it's just kind of remade anyways

51:34.080 --> 51:40.680
Pokemon heart gold and soul silver are out today on the Nintendo DS later this

51:40.680 --> 51:46.280

52:03.620 --> 52:09.080
moon on the Wii that's actually a pretty decent game build a bear welcome

52:09.080 --> 52:16.760
hugsville on DS coming from Activision who bought that game from game factory

52:16.760 --> 52:22.560

pretty big RTS game command and conquer for Tiberium Twilight coming out on PC

53:02.680 --> 53:08.120
this week residents of fate the other RPG you should be playing coming out on

53:08.120 --> 53:13.360
PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 kind of a cool game actually that one's a little

53:13.360 --> 53:15.840
bit like Final Fantasy but instead of using like magic and stuff you actually

53:15.840 --> 53:20.600
use like oozies and rocket launchers which is all sorts of cool hidden

53:20.600 --> 53:26.040
mysteries Buckingham Palace secrets of kings and queens on the DS another

53:26.040 --> 53:31.800
casual title there pizza delivery boy kind of a little bit across between

53:31.800 --> 53:39.680
cooking mama and crazy taxi on the Wii Hall of Fame ultimate hoops challenge

53:39.680 --> 53:48.120
budget basketball game on the Wii and not really a game but the new elites are

53:48.120 --> 53:53.000
supposed to be coming out this week bundled with Halo 3 ODST and Forza 3

53:53.000 --> 53:57.880
and that's it all right traveling over to Japan to look at the releases that

53:57.880 --> 54:03.800
are coming out over there on the Xbox 360 Darksiders comes out kind of say

54:03.800 --> 54:09.800
actiony ish game from Konami that I've seen described as God of War meets Zelda

54:09.800 --> 54:16.960
I'm sure that's interesting also on the Xbox 360 Momo to Jai Dyson Ryaku ultra

54:16.960 --> 54:22.000
deluxe comes out kind of a strategy type of game with these chibi little bombers

54:22.000 --> 54:26.960
and of course anime girls as the captains but it looks kind of cute don't

54:26.960 --> 54:29.560
think that'll be a game that comes out here though so you'll have to import

54:29.560 --> 54:35.200
that one that's pretty much it on the Xbox 360 PlayStation 3 has some exciting

54:35.200 --> 54:38.720
titles this week though PlayStation 3 is having something in Japan coming out

54:38.720 --> 54:42.920
this week called torn and it's also coming out with a bundle and it's not a

54:42.920 --> 54:48.060
game actually it's a DVR type system that I guess will turn your ps3 into a

54:48.060 --> 54:51.480
DVR type thing with listings and everything and I'm just thinking wow I

54:51.480 --> 54:54.560
wish something like that would come out here that sounds pretty awesome you hear

54:54.560 --> 54:58.840
about this like on the 360 in Europe with the what the u-verse I think and

54:58.840 --> 55:03.040
maybe that happens in like a limited capacity here but sadly you don't work

55:03.040 --> 55:07.720
on my cable system but that is coming out in Japan this week very cool also

55:07.720 --> 55:16.920
Ryu Ga Gotoku 4 Densetsu wo Sugumono 4 comes out this week in Japan I believe

55:16.920 --> 55:22.240
that is Yakuza 4 which is kind of funny because we just got Yakuza 3 this week

55:22.240 --> 55:27.200
in the u.s. so and of course is some of the articles that we've had recently on

55:27.200 --> 55:31.320
orange laundry calm written by our lovely webmaster deke man they cut some

55:31.320 --> 55:35.280
crap out of Yakuza 3 which is not making people happy I was thinking I was

55:35.280 --> 55:39.080
Twitter you saying something like 20 different side quests and stuff we're

55:39.080 --> 55:44.920
all cut so hopefully if they do decide to port Yakuza 4 which just came out on

55:44.920 --> 55:50.520
the ps3 in Japan this week they will not cut so darn much also on the ps3 this

55:50.520 --> 55:54.760
week in Japan the God of War collection it makes its way to Japan that's pretty

55:54.760 --> 55:58.000
much it on the ps3 going to the Nintendo Wii there really isn't much there's just

55:58.000 --> 56:03.280
one little title from Squeenix Oh Yaku de Asobo Miphi no Omocha Bako I

56:03.280 --> 56:06.400
wouldn't get too excited because I said that was Squeenix it honestly looks like

56:06.400 --> 56:10.480
like a Sesame Street type of game featuring little rabbit characters that

56:10.480 --> 56:14.480
honestly their mouths look like buttholes like I don't have a better way

56:14.480 --> 56:19.200
to explain it but if you look at their little mouths they look like balloon

56:19.200 --> 56:25.600
knots and I wouldn't yeah get too excited about that but hey there you go

56:26.640 --> 56:31.960
what are they showing to their children over there Sengoku Basara 2 on the

56:31.960 --> 56:37.680
PlayStation 2 gets a price reduction this week and going over to the Nintendo

56:37.680 --> 56:46.960
DS Haki Oki on the DS from idea factory a crayon game yay crayons and lastly

56:46.960 --> 56:53.880
going to the PSP Gundam assault survive comes out and oh this is a fun one of it

56:53.880 --> 56:58.400
Jamie will be excited for this ease one and two the seven set comes out in Japan

56:58.400 --> 57:02.560
nice they've ported those games a couple times over in Japan haven't they I like

57:02.560 --> 57:07.360
East I don't think I've seen him out over here oh I've got yes are they are

57:07.360 --> 57:15.200
they okay very cool all right Kevo in our chat wants to know why did the hell

57:15.200 --> 57:18.880
they cut so much of it I believe speaking about Yakuza 3 I believe long

57:18.880 --> 57:22.720
story short there were some things that they felt were well a you could just say

57:22.720 --> 57:26.000
they were being lazy but they rationalized it I think some of it was

57:26.000 --> 57:31.720
like mahjong minigames which you know it's not really a huge game here in the

57:31.720 --> 57:36.680
US so I guess they figured people would know how to play it and I think types of

57:36.680 --> 57:40.800
just like social things that are big in Japan because you know you the Yakuza

57:40.800 --> 57:46.240
series is very big on trying to like emulate what Japan is feeling like in a

57:46.240 --> 57:50.280
certain era so there's a lot of like social things that are built into the

57:50.280 --> 57:53.840
game and I guess Sega just felt some things were not worth translating or

57:53.840 --> 57:56.620
trying to explain to the English audience but obviously some of the

57:56.620 --> 58:01.120
hardcore fans are a little ticked off I see a lot of friends of mine really into

58:01.120 --> 58:04.060
this game though so I don't think it's really affecting you know I think if

58:04.060 --> 58:07.840
you're a fan of Yakuza you're gonna grumble and cry but you still end up

58:07.840 --> 58:16.040
playing it so all right let's move on to the UK dark Sakura on the 16th we have

58:16.040 --> 58:23.160
Dragon Age origins awakening the 17th perfect dark and on the 18th the calling

58:23.160 --> 58:29.640
on we 19th blaze blue calamity trigger command and conquer for Tiberian

58:29.640 --> 58:43.720
Twilight God of War 3 Metro 2033 moto GP 910 and supreme commander to it yeah

58:43.720 --> 58:52.680
all right okay let's see so one of the big things that they were talking about

58:52.680 --> 58:58.760
during GDC and actually something that might be kind of talked about during e3

58:58.760 --> 59:04.120
last year was on live the streaming service that's gonna be available for I

59:04.120 --> 59:09.080
guess PCs and max that's gonna allow you to play basically a whole bunch of you

59:09.080 --> 59:13.200
know big games everything from like crisis to you know just very casual

59:13.200 --> 59:19.060
games and they're all gonna be able to be streamed I guess to your you know PC

59:19.060 --> 59:25.320
with just you know very little hardware whatsoever and they announced that

59:25.320 --> 59:30.880
they're gonna be launching their service June 17th and it will be $15 per month

59:30.880 --> 59:40.400
and what's gonna you know offer this is depending on I guess you know they're

59:40.400 --> 59:44.520
gonna have like a micro console that's gonna be released later on I guess like

59:44.520 --> 59:51.280
a set-top box if you will that you can actually use instead of your PC and I

59:51.280 --> 59:56.920
guess also you'll be able to they're gonna have some upgrades later on

59:56.920 --> 01:00:02.520
they're gonna offer 1080p support at 60 frames per second as I guess more

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:09.280
bandwidth becomes available and on live I guess is gonna be going the first like

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:14.760
three months they're only only allow 25,000 people in I guess they're gonna

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:20.920
be staggering all when people can join up probably because they don't have all

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:25.040
their servers online but I mean I don't know if you're gonna want to jump on

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:28.120
board right away because really they're not gonna have a whole lot of titles

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:33.320
available at launch they're really only gonna have less than about 20 titles at

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:39.800
launch and it's gonna grow somewhere to about 50 to 60 games by 2011 some of the

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:46.240
games that they're gonna be available on the service they are mentioning that

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:52.480
Mass Effect 2 Dragon Age origins also later on Prince of Persia the Forgotten

01:00:52.480 --> 01:01:00.760
Sands will be available and apparently I guess 250,000 people signed up for the

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:05.680
online beta not that all of them were let in and it says they expect that

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:12.040
demand will far outweigh the capacity of the services servers and so that they're

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:15.240
gonna actually have people pre subscribe well of course they want to fluff it up

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:19.120
sold out hard to get into exclusive you know because they want to pump people up

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:23.280
I explain you know I'm not knocking this because certainly I think this story has

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:28.320
kind of come up before and you know it's kind of been just poo-pooed office oh

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:32.320
yeah sure that'll happen but now there's no really we're gonna have this out in

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:36.320
the fall and we plan to do this console and everything but explain to me real

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:39.560
quick and I realize there's a science behind this but I need it really broken

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:42.520
down for me here because I don't understand hardware so much how is this

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:50.280
not game tap this is basically I don't know I think it's gonna be more

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:56.240
sophisticated games basically it's not just like emulating old games or older

01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:01.540
PC titles it's like you're you know say for example you have a crappy computer

01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:06.120
that happens to be on a decent network you can run crisis now on it basically

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:12.480
with very little lag or no lag at all burnout you're gonna be able to run that

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:17.200
kind of stuff who knows if they'll go into a game tap type of situation later

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:19.960
on where they're gonna have older classic games and stuff like that what

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:23.600
was this also something about like maybe it's not really running on your computer

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:26.820
it's running on someone else's computer a server you're looking like through a

01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:31.520
window type of thing basically yes that's so strange to me yeah cuz game tab

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:34.360
you have to wait for stuff to download to your computer so I'm assuming it's a

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:37.480
little different there and this also they're gonna also have a kind of an

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:43.040
online game portal that's gonna be free as well on top of all this stuff it's

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:49.400
basically like a browser-based streaming device they're also gonna have like you

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:54.960
know free streaming of selection of demos as well so I guess the limited

01:02:54.960 --> 01:03:00.680
number of full games for rent at for a per game fee without the monthly service

01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:05.360
charge so kind of think of like what game tap did except not free you know

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:14.800
like their little free offerings I don't know it's it's interesting I just don't

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:20.000
know if I would really I would probably not use this I just don't play enough PC

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:26.040
games toy gak says if it runs on their computers I might be able to play modern

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:29.680
games again maybe that's I mean that's the whole like catch to this I think

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:33.600
that's yeah it's it's it's so it's kind of like having your PC as being a

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:38.640
console where she don't worry about your PC being up to spec to run these games

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:44.040
well you just have to have a fast enough internet connection and their PCs will

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:49.320
do the work for you interesting I'm really curious to see how this runs like

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:52.360
especially if it's if it's really that smooth because I would think I would

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:55.360
think that this would run into a similar problem is the whole Ubisoft thing is

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:59.760
that if your internet stops working the game stop working because how else are

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:02.720
you gonna get the data from the computer well yeah that's just goes with anything

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:07.640
as far as like streaming content goes you know you're on demand or anything if

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:12.800
your connections stops working then obviously yes it will shut off but

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:17.160
that's the same with like a phone call if your phone service goes out then your

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:22.880
phone call goes down but you know and I guess it would matter you know it would

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:26.880
be you have to make sure that your data center wherever that you're connecting

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:30.960
on live you know if their data center goes down or wherever nearby then yeah

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:34.480
you'd be kind of screwed chat let me pose this question to chat real quick is

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:39.400
on live something that interests you why or why not and I'll kind of ask the

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:42.200
folks the studio here the same question is on life something that interests you

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:47.360
why or why not logy no and the reason why is because I don't play a lot of PC

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:50.080
games anyways and a lot of the games that it seems like that they're gonna

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:54.120
have on here are also console crossovers which I would just play on a console on

01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:58.760
my own time if I was doing that I don't see why honestly I don't have a lot of

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:01.600
time for games anyways nowadays and I only seem to be playing like one game

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:07.680
at a time I can't see myself paying $15 a month for this I'm gonna say no for

01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:12.400
the same reasons that Loki said well I should I'm I'm interested like I'm

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:17.440
curious to see how it works in action but I think Loki hit the nail on the

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:20.840
head console crossovers most of this is already the stuff that's on consoles and

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:24.840
and I built my PC to run crisis so god damn it if I'm gonna play crisis it's

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:29.800
gonna be running on my PC Dark Sakura I don't know if this is something that

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:33.720
would interest you on live being able to have your low-end computer stream the

01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:42.160
games I don't really care about that honestly you know if I'm gonna if I'm

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:46.520
gonna play my live games I'm just gonna sit down and play them on my Xbox kick

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:52.120
down off of Borderlands all right am I is something wrong with Chad I got

01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:56.000
really quiet in there I'm a little worried chat orange launch radio.com

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.840
it's all the hallucinogens I piped through the internet keep in mind

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:01.760
there's also a delay so when I say something it takes like a minute just

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:04.880
because we encode to all games who encodes to the shout you know and

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:07.880
dah-dah-dah-dah so there's a little bit of a delay between when we say things

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:11.440
when they hit the chat room but finally we're getting some feedback here on act

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:16.880
deaf in our chat room says no because in Mexico if the service will even be

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:19.940
available here we don't have a really good connection speed it's gonna be

01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:25.880
laggy as hell probably Bochi Kawa says interested but really I don't find it

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:30.680
worth it yeah I mean you know you're asking someone to pay an extra

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:34.400
subscription fee a month but it's it feels to me like that's the other thing

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:37.400
is paying for something that I could just go sit in the other room well you

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:42.920
still have to pay for games on the Xbox well yeah but pay more well how is it

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:47.240
different from a gamefly account I don't have a gameplay account I would think a

01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:51.440
gamefly account would be the better option if you ask me granted you can't

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:55.600
stream a whole bunch of different games at a time but you got to ask yourself

01:06:55.600 --> 01:07:00.480
really are you playing like 10 games at a time I mean are you gonna go on the

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:03.720
service and go hey you know what I'm gonna play 12 different games this month

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:10.080
I mean that's great to think that you might do that but in all reality you're

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:14.560
probably not gonna it's gonna be hard to keep track of what's going on in each

01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:18.840
different game and I know you know back to the day I even then I still didn't

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:22.720
really play a ton of different games I'm usually playing one game to completion

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:25.760
or till I get tired of it and move on to something else you're not gonna see I'm

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:29.440
the opposite I'm gamer a DD all the way I play one thing and then what not

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:33.600
again what but like the fact that I'm playing Final Fantasy 13 two weeks in a

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:38.440
row pretty solidly is is really it's it's an event like if you listen to past

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:42.280
months of this show didn't go find another game that I have that much

01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:45.600
attention you wouldn't feel lost if he didn't have like these other you know

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:52.920
options like I mean I I just don't see you know 40 or 50 games on there I guess

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:59.320
that would be a good value but it's just I wouldn't see myself using it a couple

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:03.360
of the quick thoughts here from our chat room alpha-kin anagram seems to think

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:06.800
that it's Pokemon that's distracting all our chatters tonight everybody's a busy

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:10.120
catching their mudkips and they're little they're little balls that they

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:13.600
run around with now because basically they took the walking trainer and

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:17.720
incorporated that into a Pokemon game am I correct mm-hmm okay thank you I used

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:23.120
to have the old it's like bringing back Tamagotchi I swear to God that thing

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:26.760
looks like a Tamagotchi remember the old Pokemon Pikachu things that you just

01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:30.360
attached to your belt the pedometer thing that's what it is why no but

01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:34.480
remember the old ones well they do it would to compete with Tamagotchis

01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:39.440
essentially right like they're making all new again all you need to do is you

01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:44.120
download one of those free Xbox 360 massagers plug in the fucking controller

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:49.160
into the duct tape that little Walker thing on there set it to vibrate at the

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:52.920
new high setting to before you know it you'll be good to go all right I'll

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:57.000
paint shaker but a couple other quick thoughts from our chat room on the on

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.840
live Akuma JP says yes if it is cheaper I would like to play games for my net

01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:07.120
book net book is a good thought if it's a tune for net books net books could be

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:12.800
gaming devices very interesting IK ripper says maybe most likely no there

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:16.200
you go thoughts from our chat room chat dot orange on twitter.com speaking of

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:20.960
moving and pedometers and all that shit EA Sports active 2.0 is announced and

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:25.480
it's coming out for the Wii the ps3 and the iPhone oddly enough nothing said yet

01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:29.440
on the 360 I can't believe though with project at all on the horizon they

01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:32.800
aren't cooking something up for the 360 but my assumption is it's probably

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:37.840
different probably much different anyhow EA Sports active they are getting a

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:41.560
proper sequel not like a spin-off type thing like you've seen happen with the

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:45.120
first set I think they had like more exercises or whatever but a proper sequel

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:48.640
the console version of the game now they're gonna come with two motion

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:54.760
sensors and a heart rate monitor you strap on your arm and leg interesting

01:09:54.760 --> 01:10:00.000
so it's gonna measure your heart rate now by the way you can share this

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.480
information over social networks online so I'm assuming you're gonna be able to

01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:08.640
Facebook your EA active progress goody goody EA Vancouver is developing it one

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:11.800
other thing I noticed it looks like almost like a little USB thing that you

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:14.840
could like plug into your iPhone or something almost like a little dongle if

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:19.160
you will for your iPhone or of course iPod touch with that so very

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:22.800
interesting you want to know why it's not coming out on the 360 because 360

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:27.760
hasn't at all nope that's not why it's all right why 360 here's why one for the

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:32.400
heart rate monitor for the Wii you've got your stupid vitality sensor that it

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:38.760
will probably support to the Xbox 360 doesn't like Microsoft does not like

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:46.280
licensing out their wireless technology for any peripheral really they've done

01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:49.640
it with you know the rock band guitars and the guitar hero guitars but that's

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:58.080
about it the wireless technology it mostly everything has to be wired so I

01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:01.360
mean obviously since these devices are wireless you're not gonna be able to

01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:08.000
create some sort of wired device to plug in with you know the Xbox 360 a little

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:13.280
USB shit could go in yeah but they don't do that kind of stuff that's why it's

01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:18.720
it's different they have certain specifications at the meet also play

01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:24.400
nice with each other I I still think you're I can't believe that you'll EA

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:31.720
is a big big backer of 360 it's gonna be the tall that's the that's why all

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:36.520
right anyhow I could be wrong but I'm probably not let's get into our classic

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:40.400
game of the week is where I get into the end of part a believe it or not and we

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:44.840
always like to end the first half of our show by taking a trip down memory lane

01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:49.000
where dark soccer is going to visit one of our classic video games from

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.720
yesteryear the classic of the week dark Sakura what video game should all the

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:57.320
boys and girls out there be enjoying this week the game of the week is

01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:05.800
grottiest to grottiest to and keep now I have to make a mention it is not the

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:11.800
grottiest to that is that we got out as nemesis to for the nest this is

01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:18.840
grottiest to for the arcade and PC engine listen the music for a minute

01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:33.320
yes if you play Konami series of music games you heard this remix before that

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:38.880
is where burning heat came from that's why when you're actually playing the

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:43.600
music you shoot you know it shows the the sun's with the little snakes coming

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:49.120
out of the you know the fire um grottiest to it was the gratitude to

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:56.240
the ambition of gopher it was it came out in 1988 in Japan and it was the

01:12:56.240 --> 01:13:00.640
direct sequel to grottiest and the prequel to glad grottiest three of

01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:06.600
course there were versions that came out for the Famicom the PC engine in the x68

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:13.280
thousand and it is it has been we released the PC engine version and

01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:19.080
Famicom versions are out on the virtual console well not in North America until

01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:25.080
it came out in grottiest collection that came out in 2006 and then the

01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:31.760
international releases on the virtual console grottiest to came out in Europe

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:36.840
in the arcades under the name of Vulcan venture so yes more fun with the Vic

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:46.800
Viper and it did bring in some of the stuff that came from salamander or life

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:51.000
force as when the other names and also I'm sorry but I think it's really

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.400
important just basically reading chat it's really important to make this

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:57.560
distinction people think life force is grottiest too because of the way these

01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:00.720
games were marketed to us as children is that a lot of us thought life force was

01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:04.360
a secret audience but they're actually two separate series in Japan there was

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:08.800
salamander and it was grottiest we never got the actual grottiest too well not

01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:16.000
back in the NES days we got it later which I'm sure nemesis too was was like

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:21.480
the life force grottiest and not guys life for salamander that's what that's

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:24.600
a bit just a very common whoopsie because you know and again when I was a

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:27.600
kid I thought life force with the sequel to grottiest because they look the same

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:31.040
they felt the same but two different Japanese series that are just very

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:36.280
similar well um one of the good things that came with this one is also the

01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:43.240
first one that had the boss rush they had levels with there were only boss

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:48.080
confrontations so it's pretty cool so yeah you had you can pick your different

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:54.280
weapon system so that as you picked up power-ups you can choose which of your

01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:58.240
different power-ups you could do like you could speed up you had options you

01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:06.920
had missile double laser the ripple sucks by the way it always has now when

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:11.880
this came out on the Famicom it was one of the games that had a mapper chip to

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:16.920
increase the graphics and sound a lot of games in Japan had that the Nintendo

01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:23.460
being big sticklers here in the US they actually had to have they a lot of you

01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:27.040
know games were a lot better overseas because they couldn't bring them out

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:34.140
with anything other than the type the proprietary carts over here remember so

01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:39.720
there was the PC engine version in 1992 that came out as a super CD-ROM which I

01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:47.960
have a burn and one by the way one could argue that that's why this game never

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:51.800
came out in the u.s. is because the specialized car and why Konami instead

01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:56.320
took the approach to kind of market life force as a sequel to Gradius basically

01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:02.000
this is one of the games that I'm looking for a legit one by the way it is

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:09.120
just so awesome is so so if this has this is my favorite gradius game there's

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:15.480
also they added an additional stage though for the PC engine version that

01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:20.200
came from the nest version of life force that was also the first stage of gradius

01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:25.360
3 it also came out and for the gradius deluxe pack for PlayStation Saturn and

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:32.800
Windows in 96 and then came out worldwide gradius collection for the PSP

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:44.560
the of course the PC engine version was a Hanabi festival game in 2008 and of

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:48.540
course there's always sweet spots at every boss battle that's right that one

01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:56.940
spot you got a hit to kill it fast and ripple does suck I agree alright there

01:16:56.940 --> 01:17:01.320
it is your classic game of the week gradius 2 that little clip coming to you

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:04.880
from the PC engine but it's it was one reason to ever take the ripple lasers

01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:10.880
because the progression afterwards had didn't have double yeah double was in

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:15.180
yeah I mean the one that came after ripple it was it was I think it was your

01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:19.480
other option mm-hmm I know there was always a reason to take the ripple route

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:24.360
but you just always bypass ripple tiger glass a good question is a valid

01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:28.600
question for Jack just gradius to have vertical stages no no that was unique to

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:31.840
the salamander series salamander that was part of what made that series unique

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:36.840
yeah it was vertical stages good question though again all that all the

01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:41.240
marketing changes and stuff from Japan over here kind of screwed us up as a kid

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:45.120
you know when Final Fantasy 7 came out who didn't ask where the hell was fourth

01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:50.480
through six I think I thought it was kind of cool they're like yeah we know I

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:53.680
think by then a lot of people have figured it out but you know all right

01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:57.040
anyhow we're gonna take a break here at orange launch radio we got plenty more

01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:01.840
coming up some quick news when we come back about DJ hero and Tron yes and

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:06.120
we'll see that trailer for the new Tron movie looks sweet but I got to say well

01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:10.560
actually no I take it back the movie is probably gonna be ridiculous but the

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:15.160
score by Daft Punk sounds amazing just even based on that little trailer I saw

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:25.360
gotta say very cool all right um let's see also news on XNA and Nintendo and

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:28.760
another Hanabi festival coming up we're gonna get into all of that a little

01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:32.280
later on in part B of our show so don't go anywhere we'll be right back with

01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:42.760
more of orange lounge radio and welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio on

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:47.400
this Sunday night March 14th of 2010 that's right pie day hope you're

01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:50.600
enjoying some pie we're not really having pie in studio which is a bit

01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:53.880
surprising I'm kind of full though I had fast food on the way over to the show

01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:57.440
driving back from San Francisco sadly I was I was in San Francisco but not a

01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:01.320
game developers conference but you know I'm not a game developer and you know

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:05.440
you have to be one of the big media companies that's a magazine or whatever

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:08.480
to get in there but that's okay although I think I would find the topics

01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:12.920
fascinating like you know I I kind of like the science of game development and

01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:16.280
stuff you know I understand that it's not really a media event that's what

01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:19.520
e3 is for so I'm not gonna be all butthurt I'm not going although I wish I

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:24.480
I wish I could have crashed some of the sweet parties try the move stuff out but

01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:28.520
that's about it it's all gonna be at e3 in a couple months anyway yeah so I'm

01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:31.880
not you know too worried about it I mean of course I don't even know if I'm going

01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:35.440
to e3 this year I am definitely not going to do that out sorry to hear it it's

01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:40.840
just you know it's it's a strain to try to go you know each year anyways and I

01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:45.640
kind of I gotta take a day a year off I mean like last year remember we went it

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:50.320
was kind of like yeah this is cool I feel like there's really more I want to

01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:55.640
see this year between the portal to the final has he 14 the move the Natal all

01:19:55.640 --> 01:20:00.520
this stuff you know or whatever Xbox ends up naming their thing I all that

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:03.400
stuff I want to see this year so it seems like there's more to it in good

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:09.960
time I don't know it's just I don't know all right well let's get into some

01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:13.280
rapid-fire news and then we're gonna get in some Twitter topics as well so you

01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:16.240
just have a few more minutes to get your Twitter topics and we have a few porn

01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:21.640
into the Twitter already at olr porn what pouring pouring I said it fast all

01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:26.800
right Loki start us off with some quick news tonight well Activision surprised

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:33.520
us whoo they have new download content coming out to DJ hero unfortunately I

01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:38.160
don't give a flying fuck about it and this is really sad I mean unless you're

01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:42.120
a fan of you've been asking for it for for oh yes I've been asking for it I was

01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:45.760
hoping that they would I don't know put out some good download content and

01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:50.880
granted you know I guess if you like Eminem and jay-z you probably would have

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:55.720
bought the renegade edition I didn't so I didn't and therefore I'm not buying

01:20:55.720 --> 01:21:00.120
this either but for the sake of reporting it I will tell you what three

01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:06.600
mixes they have in there shake that mixed with show me what you got without

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:14.160
me mixed with encore and can I get a mix with lose yourself and I've I've watched

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:20.440
the the video previews of these and let me just say I'm about as excited about

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:26.280
these songs as I have been describing these songs to you it's seriously awful

01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:30.360
really what you're more of a trance guy anyway I mean and yeah that's fine but I

01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:35.320
even gave the last the extended mix pack whatever I gave that chance and I didn't

01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:40.880
really check up I downloaded the David Guada stuff but I did I like that I have

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:47.200
not and maybe I'll go back to that but I like the other pack to the there was

01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:53.160
there was a what was it gorillas and something oh the the honor all of me and

01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:57.760
radio gaga yeah that's my favorite of the whole freaking gayest extended mix

01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:01.960
yeah and that's in the that download mix is and there I think gorilla song was in

01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:06.600
the other song in there but yeah I I have to me I realized Eminem jay-z they

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:12.520
sell bazillions of albums but I'm just not I'm like I don't mind I know

01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:15.560
whatever not for me but I understand there's an audience for it I wouldn't

01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:19.160
mind those songs like if there's an Eminem song mix with like you know Queen

01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:23.000
or something like something different you know I'm like the stuff that was in

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:28.280
the game I don't really care for to our you know rap R&B songs mixed together

01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:34.520
and the same time also it's just like really how long have I had to wait for

01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:40.240
another download pack I'm sorry but this is kind of like you know an insult to me

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:44.280
it's just like yeah you know we're just gonna let you know that it's out there

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:47.760
and I have DJ here on my Twitter you know they're on my Twitter and stuff and

01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:52.160
like you know putting these retweets for like stupid shit like artists going oh

01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:56.840
my god DJ here it's so cool it's like seriously you know when the fuck are you

01:22:56.840 --> 01:23:01.160
gonna download or add some more download content you support this stuff but then

01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:05.640
again we're talking Activision here so you really I've just got to wait for

01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:11.040
some sort of DJ game from harmonix or EA before I get that real download content

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:15.960
because I sure as hell I'm not gonna get it with Activision so what about scratch

01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:23.320
the ultimate DJ yeah when's that coming out I haven't seen that yet well I think

01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:27.720
it's coming out around the time dude Newcomb forever is coming out and never

01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:31.520
anyways if you're interested in purchasing these they are available on

01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:38.360
March 18th for $8 or 640 Microsoft points and the tracks will not be sold

01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:45.000
separately so yeah however if you are on the Wii guess what you are in luck

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:50.760
because you get them for a dollar more that's right there sold as single

01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:56.280
downloads for 300 300 we points and that's a total of $9 for each so guess

01:23:56.280 --> 01:24:03.680
what you get to pay the Wii Premium okay I'm done there now what is kind of neat

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:08.040
is they're gonna be adding a new way to navigate PlayStation home apparently

01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:13.160
it's kind of take of the cross-media bar and the way they're doing it is they're

01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:16.200
gonna be able to go to different spaces like for example you can favorite

01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:22.800
different spaces you like going to you can go to you know personal spaces you

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:26.160
know whatever it'll make a lot I forgot that came out this week it'll be a lot

01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:29.360
quicker to like kind of bounce from one place to another without having to walk

01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:33.080
aimlessly through and I do anything with the olr club yet which by the way is

01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:37.400
full I keep getting requests for the club and unfortunately I'm limited 25

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:40.760
members and I keep get like I seriously get new requests to join the club like

01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:44.240
every other day which I'm flattered and thank you all for wanting to join but

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:47.480
unfortunately it's full so until Sony will let us have like I don't know 50

01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:51.360
people 100 people all your apps are just sitting there waiting to be approved

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:55.400
until like I'm not rejecting them I'm just not answering them it because I'm

01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:59.800
hoping that one day Sony's gonna say hey we're gonna make clubs useful and I can

01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:04.360
have 50 or 100 probably just they can't physically you know handle that many

01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:08.520
people in one space at a time or in that close that's a bunch of ball because if

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:11.880
you go to the main space area you can see more than 25 people there at a time

01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:16.960
no offense I just yeah but if that's Sony's line I claim bullshit yeah but

01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:21.320
how many servers are running that one space or I don't know whatever they're

01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:25.320
just not doing it but you know what I'm not going on home either so I this

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:28.560
doesn't mean anything to me as well yeah I wonder if there's gonna be a theme

01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:34.800
going on here but let's find out this is kind of neat apparently people think

01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:38.240
that you're gonna have the power of the ps3 in your pocket within three years

01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:46.040
the group imagination technologies maker of the power of VR chips says that I

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:50.280
guess powers like you know smartphones like iPhones the Droid and whatnot they

01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:55.440
said that they you'll have graphics comparable to ps3 in three years and the

01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:58.520
reason is because they're designing the chips right now for that kind of stuff

01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:05.000
apparently they're working with different new groups to license things

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:11.400
you know you know like Apple HTC whatnot they're saying that in three years

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:14.640
imagination says you're gonna have a ps3 in your pocket and it's not gonna be

01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:20.120
running at 40 by 340 resolution that most smartphones have now but it's

01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:26.920
actually gonna be like a 720p output via HDMI to a TV that would be something

01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:29.880
that phone that outputs to a TV via HDMI

01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:40.040
interesting and yeah they go into a lot more detail of course on different

01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:45.000
technologies are out there and stuff but you can only imagine though that as you

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.400
know time goes on I mean the technology is just growing you know and at you

01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:53.560
know geometric rate that of course I can imagine you know I was actually having

01:26:53.560 --> 01:27:00.000
that kind of technology soon within like next five years well yeah that seems a

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:04.040
little aggressive seeing as if you go by the whole like Nintendo is is one off

01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:09.520
from the you know consoles with their handhelds meaning that the DS is kind of

01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:13.000
like a 64 just like the advance was kind of like a super Nintendo then the next

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.480
handheld for Nintendo will be kind of like a GameCube funny that you mentioned

01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:20.080
that actually oh oh I have something they'll be for last-minute stories for

01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:23.360
that I can cover it now if you why not yes please please don't make me wait

01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:28.600
any longer I need to know I need to know I'm dying apparently there's a rumor

01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:32.000
about ds2 of course there's always a rumor about you there's always some damn

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:37.240
remember um according to somebody sources within GDC I'm not gonna read

01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:40.640
through the article to see who exactly is quoting here that it's in the

01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:43.480
developers hands and apparently they're not having trouble developing for it

01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:48.120
because it's basically a GameCube power wise and everyone knows how to develop

01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:51.720
for a GameCube because they've been doing it for quite a while with both

01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:56.120
well because the Wii is a GameCube too basically yes the little the thing is

01:27:56.120 --> 01:28:00.880
you know it's gonna be interesting this is apparently the people are familiar

01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:04.760
with the dev kit made it sound like there wasn't much learning curve on the

01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:09.920
new system and that devs who worked on GameCube or Wii games will find it easy

01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:14.120
to create with also they said that apparently the system has a built-in

01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:18.480
accelerometer and two big higher resolution screens that are closer

01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:25.000
together so that they can more easily be used as one screen and I guess the

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.480
biggest bit of news however is that the devs say that they'll be done with their

01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:33.760
games by the end of 2010 meaning that we may see an announcement at e3 well

01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:36.280
it's kind of something we've been thinking for a while it's gonna happen

01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:40.960
yeah despite the DS IX L I told you if they could do the micro so close to the

01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:46.720
DS they can do the XL and have ds2 out 83 despite all their responses to the

01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:49.840
cause you know I like the idea of bringing the two screens closer together

01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:52.880
to make one big screen I think that's kind of cool yeah I wonder if they're

01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:59.000
both be tons of touch sensitive this time right yeah why not and by the way

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.680
just pro tip Nintendo if it's gonna run on like GameCube II type hardware f0 ok

01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:08.440
thanks all right and just because it runs on GameCube type hardware does not

01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:12.200
mean that I want to see fucking ports of every single GameCube game that you guys

01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:17.000
put out okay do some new shit seriously well at least unless it's Wind Waker

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.600
Wind Waker I will accept the rest of them except every time zero I reject

01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:27.480
them all all right and for the gods sake please you know maybe add some more

01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:30.680
buttons to the face like an analog stick or something like that so that we can

01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:34.440
actually play games in traditional sense seven these like remember remember they

01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:37.720
used to have that like thumb stylus thing that you would have to strap to

01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:43.320
your finger they came with yes yes I do what were yeah I know that you could use

01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:46.720
that in the mario 64 game to kind of control it uh-huh yeah it didn't didn't

01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:50.680
really work yeah all right anyhow let's go a little old-school let's go very

01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:54.560
old-school Donkey Kong of course there's a whole movie made out of the Battle of

01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:58.240
the Donkey Kong high scores the King of Kong remember that it was Billy Mitchell

01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:01.880
Steve Weeby Ryan and good versus evil or whatever you however you want to look at

01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:05.880
it well guess what the whole movie has just been made irrelevant because there

01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:11.960
is a new king in town and it's neither it's a new guy who Hank Chien is his

01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:15.640
name he's a plastic surgeon from New York he has beaten Billy Mitchell's

01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:18.760
record Billy Mitchell by the way had one million fifty thousand two hundred

01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:23.520
points built our Hank sorry Hank has scored one million sixty one thousand

01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:28.920
seven hundred points officially verified by twin galaxies an original Donkey Kong

01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:33.600
cabinet machine in New York is how he said it congrats to him now he can star

01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:39.760
in the sequel after a leading his high score he was heard quoted saying suck it

01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:45.760
bitch yeah a tape has just arrived at twin galaxies from Billy Mitchell believe

01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:51.360
it or not or who was it that was saying that like the the other person's high

01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:56.520
score was like false or something like that like there was one of the two guys

01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:59.160
that were complaining people get really into I don't know I didn't watch the

01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:02.440
you know when I watched the movie I was just like damn people really get into

01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:06.120
this shit but then I'm like oh I host a podcast on the internet about video

01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:09.520
games like well I want to hold the high score for something really stupid that

01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:14.760
you know I want to be all pompous hey I remember when we went to classic gaming

01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:18.520
Expo one year and they were doing like the official twin galaxies high score

01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:23.600
for I think it was stampede on the 2,600 that I played stampede dude I think I

01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:27.720
was like last place for the day I was so fucking terrible at stampede but the guy

01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:30.760
was trying to give me tips and stuff and what he was saying made a lot of sense

01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:35.200
but I was just like wow when I was a kid I didn't think about these games like

01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:38.400
that like the tips and everything he was trying to give me like I was just like I

01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:44.040
just tried to lasso the horse thingies anyhow hey Tron something else from my

01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:47.800
childhood of course Tron legacy that trailer hit the internet this week and I

01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:53.300
gotta say although I my expectation bar for Tron like legacy is very very low

01:31:53.300 --> 01:32:00.600
because Tron wasn't really a good movie per se it was just as an awesome movies

01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:04.760
what it was one of those things that you just you like it better because you're a

01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:11.120
kid and you know just the technology it's cool it's cool cycles it's not so

01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:15.960
much good it's just cool so Tron legacies coming out I gotta say despite

01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:18.320
the fact that the expectation bar for the movies are very low you know I'm

01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:21.760
gonna be seeing it opening day okay you know I'm gonna go just like many of you

01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:27.840
the score by Daft Punk sounds awesome like what's a word that's better than

01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:33.880
awesome more awesome awesomer super off more awesomer than a lot of game

01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:37.200
soundtracks out there well anyhow there's another track tie into Tron

01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:41.960
legacy going on it's called arcade aid apparently if you actually go into the

01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:46.620
Flynn lives website you can get this this picture that references I guess

01:32:46.620 --> 01:32:50.760
they say 56 different arcade games old-school arcade games like I see

01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:54.080
burger time like there's a little burger with a clock so that's one of the oops

01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:58.280
I gave one away sorry but I totally dig the space paranoid signs still on the

01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:03.000
building it's very similar to like I've seen something similar in Rolling Stone

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:07.240
that like had all these different band names as a picture like somebody

01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:11.240
smashing a pumpkin there get it all these things like that I already did all

01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:17.880
these like for example Goldeneye Star Fox Sea Wolf I see Kongo Bongo there at

01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:21.920
the bottom no that's actually Donkey Konga Frogger because it's a donkey and

01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:28.400
classic game I know shadow Colossus Frogger outrun because it's an

01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:34.940
outrunning huh funny spoil everything geez well that's what I do that one

01:33:34.940 --> 01:33:41.680
right there is Bertie King it's a golf game time splitters bomber made sheet it

01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:47.200
off a website in you know I actually figured thank you can thank me putting

01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:51.360
together my main cabinet for being aware of all these different because a lot of

01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:55.760
the stuff I have themes for my hyper spin stuff so you know the names became

01:33:55.760 --> 01:34:00.400
familiar I actually did you can ask my co-worker because I sat there for the

01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:03.840
first hour that day that it came out during the day and just working on that

01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:08.200
SSJ 100 as she 100 Matt says it was a good B movie Tron that is that's a good

01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:11.720
way of just finding it I like Tron for the same reason I like showgirls it's so

01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:18.800
bad you are a horror darlin I love Tron actually good movie to me end of line

01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:22.880
have you seen the game trailer for Tron legacy I have doesn't it remind you of

01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:28.200
force unleashed hmm I wasn't thinking of it that way but yeah I just I love the

01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:31.360
old-school Tron arcade game and that was awesome but of course it's one of those

01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:34.080
things that's better left in my memory because I played on an Xbox Live I was

01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:38.240
kind of like yeah well in Tron and disc of Tron are actually the bottom of that

01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:41.880
page to they really yeah all right anyhow act F'd also says it was Empire

01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:44.880
magazine that did that collage I'm thinking of it's probably been done a

01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:48.160
couple times I want to say there's a movie one out there too yeah anyhow who

01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:51.400

remember the game hotel dusk also I haven't talked about the tester on this

01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:05.960
show in a few weeks which I have what I've watched every episode last week

01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:09.920
you did talk about oh never mind then okay okay finish I just okay yes you

01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:18.040
can remember hotel desk yes the company that made it sing is a to over 200

01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:26.520
million in debt they also did another code they did town factory for little

01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:32.240
king story and last window yeah we better buy some more of their copies of

01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:35.840
again which is coming out at the end of this month because that was also by the

01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:42.800
them I think they filed for bankruptcy on March 1st 200 million yen so we need

01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:47.480
to sell 200 million copies of that game I know you can do it um the final new

01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:51.560
character for Street Fighter 4 has been released and it's a big red dude covered

01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:56.840
in oil wearing what looks like a hat made out of Legos on his head and he's a

01:37:56.840 --> 01:38:01.760
grappler and he slides and he's a splashing oil everywhere this is

01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:07.440
actually kind of sploogeworthy so I I gotta give props to Alan he recognized

01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:11.000
what they were referencing he's a Turkish oil wrestler it's this big thing

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:15.880
in in other countries like of Turkey where they douse themselves in what

01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:20.960
appears to be ky jelly type of substance and wrestle each other it is pretty

01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:26.400
homorific but no homo I've I've heard of it it's just the the screen captures

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:30.040
like dude you're red Greco Roman normally what's that isn't that like

01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:34.560
Greco Roman oh I don't know he told me it was he told me to google image search

01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:39.440
Turkish oil wrestling and let's just say I got a lot of guys who didn't look

01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:49.440
quite as bad as that guy okay not wearing a blue Lego hat also is it

01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:57.560
Mullen you yeah well I know whatever um anyway the guy who makes fable yeah

01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:03.520
really but basically saying that comparing natal and move he said well

01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:06.520
move is a good step in the right direction but it's not as big as natal

01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:14.680
and he's not biased or anything well says first-party developer for Microsoft

01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:18.520
saying that that move is going to be more for the casual market and natal is

01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:25.640
going to be more for the immersive gamer so fable 3 will blow your mind except it

01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:30.680
won't to be exactly like the last two games but he'll claim that it like blows

01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:41.960
your mind it blows you I I'm interested to see what what the natal Lincoln is

01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:47.160
but they do say on that natal is not mandatory for fable 3 which I also like

01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:58.040
I will allow you to slap a bitch Oh Loki what we do without you here at

01:39:58.040 --> 01:40:01.400
orange lounge radio we would die that's what would happen we would die how about

01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:06.160
some Twitter topics speaking of death no actually we have some good questions

01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:08.320
tonight we have some really good questions on the Twitter twitter.com

01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:11.960
slash olr I'm going to allow usually I don't allow more than one question a

01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:16.720
person but M and Ziba has a couple good ones tonight so I will I will grant an

01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:22.120
exception M and Ziba asking what is the deal with the chocobo what is the deal

01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:28.560
with the chocobo in Final Fantasy 13 is there a use for it or is it just there

01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:32.400
to look cute and to make it a Final Fantasy game I think it's a little bit

01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:36.640
the second part it is there to look cute and make it a little more of a Final

01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:41.720
Fantasy game because since there is no like world map type thing they had to

01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:45.280
incorporate a chocobo I think another way one big bitch about the game by the

01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:48.880
way is that there's no Final Fantasy victory music you never hear doo doo doo

01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:52.760
doo doo doo doo doo you never hear that but there at least there's a chocobo um

01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:57.440
I will say this though they do treat the chocobo as a character and I think

01:40:57.440 --> 01:41:00.160
that's what makes this a little bit unique compared to the other Final Fantasy

01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:03.640
games like you know if you go into the bio cards you know when you're looking

01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:07.440
into data log which is like a memory bank section of the game so you can read

01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:11.240
what's going on all the characters have their little profiles with the data log

01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:16.320
the chocobo has his own entry so I don't know if maybe the chocobo becomes more

01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:20.800
relevant later in the story but he's awfully cute I want a fat chocobo to

01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:24.040
hold your items yeah it's all my items it'd be awesome if he has a playable

01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:29.000
character later on all right and M&Z but since I'm allowing the second tweet

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:33.800
tonight says this should be the game for the sweet off the Swedish Armed Forces

01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:36.300
the team test remember we were talking about the sweet off with one of our

01:41:36.300 --> 01:41:40.960
callers last week well there's this I've never even heard of this we just got a

01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:46.200
link here to the Swedish Armed Forces team test and I guess it's some type of

01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:50.080
like online little ranking thing I'll have to look into this and see if it's

01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:52.960
appropriate for the sweet off but I don't know like part of me is like the

01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:57.720
sweet off should happen with like president cat or beat mania 2dx or

01:41:57.720 --> 01:42:02.800
something a little more showish or olr match game I think I think we have to do

01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:06.160
all our match game for the sweet off I think that's that's just mandatory but I

01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:10.040
appreciate the suggestion don't get me wrong tiger claw links us I'm sorry it's

01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:14.880
actually tiger call 305 on Twitter links us to a story on one up about ensemble

01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:18.080
and pandemic talking about their company closures they're actually taking

01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:22.400
responsibility and blaming themselves according to the one-up article Paul

01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:26.280
Bettner he was an employee of ensemble studios for 12 years of course it was

01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:29.760
shut down by Microsoft in 2008 he blamed their own internal crunch

01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:34.040
culture saying quote the reality is that every single game we shipped took twice

01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:38.360
as long as we said it was going to take and cost twice as much to make Microsoft

01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:41.480
as a public company they answer to their shareholders and we were simply too

01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:46.160
expensive kind of an interesting little article kind of um interesting to hear

01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:50.520
folks taking responsibility for what happened but still kind of a it's a

01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:53.840
rarity nowadays it is a rarity nowadays but still kind of a bummer by the way

01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:59.200
when the show is bad it's never my fault always Loki's that means it's never my

01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:05.040
fault either it's rarely notice it's sometimes but all right Nico Nico Chan

01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:09.640
links us to a website I think this might be a I think this might be a website

01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:13.120
plug I don't know but I'll read it Pokemon ro dotnet what do you think

01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:17.720
about it it's like red blue made from Ragnarok online system and skills but

01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:22.360
with a ton of customs Jamie apparently knows it yes and we'll play we'll play

01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:27.840
we'll play a plus plus we'll play again they're there right now right now I

01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:34.080
hardly have time to play anything but this I will when I when my brain works

01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:38.040
and I have time gonna make some time gonna make some time in between killing

01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:44.240
the Klingons and Gorn spazzinator PSN says okay since it's pie day here's a

01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:48.920
random question pizza or pasta Boston cream see I get what he's doing there

01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:52.680
because they call it pizza they don't really call it pizza pie here at least I

01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:59.720
never hear that term but yeah I think it's less deep dish here yeah I do love

01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:04.160
Boston cream pies but it's like I'll still always have pumpkins so I've got

01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:09.560
to go for pizza like if you're asking me one pie versus all of pizza those more

01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:15.860
of a cake I mean really it's it's it's a cake with a cream layer in it but you

01:44:15.860 --> 01:44:20.360
still elect Boston cream over pizza no I really love Boston cream pie I had it

01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:26.880
for breakfast last week let's say let's see Ryan Belknap is wishing us a happy

01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:30.320
pie day but he's also trying to imitate a spammer I see what you're doing there

01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:36.160
he's a Twitter folks it's SSJ 100 Matt on Twitter but his Twitter name is Matt

01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:41.080
Ostrovsky which I always mispronounce dr. love himself Gene Simmons will be

01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:45.640
voicing Guitar Hero 6 could it be Guitar Hero kiss awesome how this missed the

01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:48.440
show world tonight but I remember reading about this apparently Gene

01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:51.680
Simmons has said he's doing Guitar Hero but Gene Simmons also one of those guys

01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:55.760
that I get the feeling might batter off about something what he really doesn't

01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:59.120
know what he's talking about so like he might be saying he's doing Guitar Hero

01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:02.160
six but I totally see like maybe there's a kiss Guitar Hero game in the works

01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:07.040
it's not actually I could see him being the voice of Guitar Hero just because he

01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:11.440
said he's the voice of Guitar Hero but here's the thing is he's also the voice

01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:18.160
of I need to get paid because you know we're not putting out any new albums and

01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:22.600
we are doing touring sometimes but you know what he's been on Celebrity

01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:29.080
Apprentice he's had his own reality show he's you know he's horned himself out

01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:32.920
okay that's really what it comes down to and and he was on the Celebrity

01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:36.280
Apprentice for heaven's sakes I mean that's that's where celebrities go and

01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:39.360
because they need attention and you know what cool he can be in the next Guitar

01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:43.000
Hero game just don't be pissed off if he's singing Kelly Clarkson can't wait

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:47.680
can't wait for the youtubes of Gene Simmons singing Taylor Swift you belong

01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:56.480
to me anyhow uh that was my Taylor Swift impression by the way or Lady Gaga or

01:45:56.480 --> 01:46:06.120
something can't wait the full in the full makeup you belong to me yes Taylor

01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:11.240
Swift sings like a muppet um lastly on the OLR Twitter brick tone asks us and I

01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:14.640
this is kind of a fragmented question apparently he was challenged with 140

01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:19.560
characters support for ps3 crash question mark well I don't support the

01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:26.320
ps3 crash but you know mistakes happen I put it kind of on the same level as the

01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:31.320
Red Ring of Death it's unnecessary Ubisoft online PC copy protection and

01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:34.680
what do you think of the wiimote for ps3 well we talked about the PC thing a

01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:38.080
little earlier and go listen to last week's show this way I wish the Red

01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:42.240
Ring of Death was exactly like the PlayStation Network fail or the ps3

01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:46.160
failures because if the Red Ring of Death would just go away after a day I

01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:50.120
wouldn't be complaining as much of it oh well that's an inconvenience but I'll

01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:55.920
just wait 24 hours and it'll be all better no that's not the case it happens

01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:00.320
to all the consoles that's true I don't go after a day I would rather have the

01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:04.560
24 hour shutdown than the you know permanent shutdown and lastly what do

01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:06.920
you think of the wiimote for ps3 well again I think we talked about that a

01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:10.160
little bit earlier in the show I think it's a necessary step for Sony but it's

01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:13.640
an unnecessary peripheral for me to buy right now that's where I'm at until I

01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:19.100
see that must-have game I'm not sold and I don't know what that must-have game is

01:47:19.100 --> 01:47:23.240
but it's not like Sony can't create a new IP because like little big planet

01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:28.720
hello that is like a system seller ps3 game is that good you know uncharted is

01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:32.840
that good speaking of little big plant you did you see the video of like how

01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:38.120
exactly the PlayStation move works in I'm gonna be honest no I just heard it

01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:43.600
is compatible did it look good no it's basically you know how in Super Mario

01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:46.840
Galaxy the other players control like a curse or whatever and they could shoot

01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:53.960
shit no this one you basically control a cursor and you can move shit well yeah

01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:57.880
it might add another element to level design and I'm all for it you know again

01:47:57.880 --> 01:48:02.520
where I give major major props to media molecule and Sony is that they're not

01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:07.280
milking little big planet for a two and three and four they keep making the

01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:11.960
first game better and making it so much more of a value so it's hard to be mad

01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:16.040
yeah you know what it's another feature it's just one I probably I'd like to

01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:20.680
think of it as a continuous of all continuously evolving experience God I

01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:24.040
wish games were like and you know what I think that they could do a little big

01:48:24.040 --> 01:48:28.600
planet too but just release as a download pack look new levels that do

01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:33.000
you think maybe just ModNation racers will probably have it too at some point

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:36.760
just wasn't ready to show yet like gripping the steering wheel wheel with

01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:42.840
your you know not wiimote you know I'm sure it's an inevitable thanks for the

01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:46.800
tweets guys twitter.com slash olr give us a follow we really appreciate it and

01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:50.160
by the way I also wanted to say this at some point in the show tonight we really

01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:54.180
do appreciate five-star reviews on iTunes and people that help spread the

01:48:54.180 --> 01:48:57.920
word because you know we do say at the end of every show you know tell a friend

01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:00.720
or two about the show and help spread the word about orange launch radio

01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:04.800
that's really all we ask to continue doing this show for you guys and I just

01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:08.920
want to say there were a couple of really really nice reviews left on

01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:12.480
iTunes this week I wanted to read them because they were very very nice and

01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:17.120
with last week's show even with last week's show these were both left in the

01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:21.640
past week for a short and sweet one from Bert 777 saying I love it been listening

01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:25.120
for a while anybody into video games give these awesome people a chance so

01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:29.400
thank you Bert hope Ernie's doing well and but I want to read this one this is

01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:33.360
just sweet this this gave me the awe feeling and and really makes doing the

01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:37.040
show worthwhile shadow seven seven says I've been listening to OLR for at least

01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:40.720
three years and over time they went from being a good podcast to an epic podcast

01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:44.040
they are opinionated and well-informed on video game matters and to top it off

01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:47.120
for really funny over time they have honed their broadcasting skills and

01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:50.160
their radio voices and have become a podcast that I would actually pay money

01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:54.520
to hear they do go off on tangents quite often though choo-choo this is a plus to

01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:58.040
me but always managed to wrap something up about video games into the subject

01:49:58.040 --> 01:50:01.000
they are always current about the video game industry and run the gamut on

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:05.960
topics from reviews to previews to info on various video game developers and

01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:09.280
publishers to things random to describe the live show is something new

01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:11.720
experience and they actually pay attention to the chat room and take

01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:15.240
calls the community is also fairly active so I just want to say thank you

01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:19.000
because you know people take the time out to write these nice reviews and I

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.720
realize yeah it's a little bit of ego stroking and so forth but I actually

01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:25.320
read that it made me go oh that's really nice like somebody didn't have to say

01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:30.600
all that and they did and I just wanted to share the the odds so thank you very

01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:35.080
much again those are five-star reviews from iTunes and of course you know all

01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:38.960
we ask I realize not everybody's on the Apple bandwagon like if I asked Loki to

01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:41.960
leave a five-star review on iTunes he told me to play hide and go fuck myself

01:50:41.960 --> 01:50:46.120
from last week's show so it just tell friends about the show that's all we I

01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:50.000
don't go on iTunes I know you don't you know that's against you can rate them on

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:56.600
zoom to just you know all right anyhow let's move on some actual video gaming

01:50:56.600 --> 01:51:00.360
news let's get past the ego stroking and get to some more video game news

01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:05.680
because there's plenty of it still to go more stuff coming out from you know this

01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:10.760
week there's actually some information you know we talked a little about in the

01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:18.080
tall and whatnot but can't forget about XNA XNA game studio 4.0 apparently is

01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:24.960
including support for Windows phones and they're even going to be including some

01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:31.360
new features including gamer tags avatar support and achievements you can unlock

01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:37.200
on your phone that's right there's going to be games that you can use for

01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:42.280
unlocking achievements kind of like an Xbox Live arcade game in fact you can

01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:50.080
unlock up to 200 Microsoft or gamerscore points and I guess it's going to be

01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:56.440
displayed on your Xbox Live gamer tag profile like the games for Windows stuff

01:51:56.440 --> 01:52:01.080
because there was that one game tinker was it called that you can only get on

01:52:01.080 --> 01:52:03.400
the windows thing it was like the free game that came with the games for

01:52:03.400 --> 01:52:06.440
Windows client and you could play that game I reviewed it about a month ago I

01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:09.000
think it was called tinker and it would show up in your profile just like any

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.720
older the game and it had its own set of achievement points so it's kind of like

01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:16.280
that but now on your cell phone yeah and it's kind of neat I think that's a cool

01:52:16.280 --> 01:52:20.200
idea you know for you know how Apple should have done it achievement whores

01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:25.840
they well you know sometimes achievements like that it gets people

01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:28.960
to buy the game well there's a whole study out of GDC again it's not on the

01:52:28.960 --> 01:52:32.360
show tonight but there's a whole thing on achievements and it does motivate

01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:36.000
people to play games and there's a percentage of people it's a small

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:39.360
percentage but a percentage that really try to go after every single achievement

01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:43.280
in a game you know and and we'll buy games with a chief didn't they say to

01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:48.400
that games with really easy achievements especially in arcade will sell a little

01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:54.640
more times me so hey why not if it's a way to draw attention to the windows

01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:58.560
phone anything to pull the eyes away from Apple for a minute I I think is a

01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:04.280
good idea mm-hmm all right with this would this get you on board with a

01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:07.360
windows phone though Loki since I know you're not gonna get an iPhone no because

01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:11.360
the data plans on phones are too expensive and it's just you know if they

01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:15.960
brought down if it was like 50 bucks a month for unlimited data and everything

01:53:15.960 --> 01:53:19.640
then maybe because that's what I kind of pay for my phone right now but even then

01:53:19.640 --> 01:53:22.760
I don't use that many minutes right now and I'm actually thinking about going to

01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:27.400
a prepaid phones where I don't have to you know like 100 bucks a year type

01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:35.440
stuff you know we're literally I'm lucky if I use six to twelve minutes a month

01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:40.160
well somebody is teasing me yet again with the idea of a new Kid Icarus game

01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:43.220
remember about a year or two ago where we were convinced this was coming out at

01:53:43.220 --> 01:53:46.880
e3 we had the screenshots and everything and it just didn't fucking happen how

01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:52.040
sad well again we get teased and you can kind of thank Kotaku for that but really

01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:55.640
it was because they were interviewing Yoshio Sakamoto who of course was one of

01:53:55.640 --> 01:54:00.200
the creators of Kid Icarus I guess they cornered him at GDC or something and

01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:03.600
basically he said in a nutshell that you know they're not opposed to bringing out

01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:06.880
Kid Icarus to the Wii they just don't know what to do here's the quote quote I

01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:11.520
don't know personally about any project underway regarding Kid Icarus but if so

01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:14.320
many of these people are interested in it and really want to see it on the Wii

01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:20.280
they should really speak up are they deaf because I think like a lot of

01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:23.560
people have been like speaking up for a while but okay whatever well are we do

01:54:23.560 --> 01:54:28.360
we need to do a petition online is that what needs to happen good gosh I'm sure

01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:33.360
there's plenty already again moving on with a quote quote if we can find some

01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:37.320
sort of way to bring it to the Wii a way to make the game for the Wii that makes

01:54:37.320 --> 01:54:42.000
sense we would happily do so but just keep in mind it may not be me making the

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:45.720
game so in other words he's admitting it might be somebody else just like how

01:54:45.720 --> 01:54:49.680
Metroid other M is is in somebody else's hands and so forth honestly I think if

01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:52.600
they want to do a Kid Icarus game on the Wii why not just do like a souped up

01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:57.460
version Allah even though even I hate to say it because I received this game so

01:54:57.460 --> 01:55:01.160
tepidly but maybe the blaster master game just a little more polished or the

01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:05.320
just like the Mario new Super Mario Brothers Wii you don't have to like

01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:11.200
totally reinvent Kid Icarus just you know make it a fancy looking 2d game

01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:17.440
with some new features that's all you really need to do I think but all right

01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:21.440
I just hate the idea that's getting teased on that again because I would

01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:24.800
really love to see a Kid Icarus but again I want to see him do it right I

01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:27.600
don't want to see him just slap something with the character his name on

01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:31.480
it and it sucks so I rather they just don't touch it at all and I'm sure a lot

01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:34.860
of you guys feel the same way anyhow dark soccer what you got I want the most

01:55:34.860 --> 01:55:40.120
epic Kid Icarus ever I do too I you know and especially you would think with God

01:55:40.120 --> 01:55:44.400
of War which is another Greek mythology thing doing very well on another

01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:48.120
platform you think Nintendo would would already have some ideas on how you can

01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:51.760
make the Greek mythology thing successful I know how about Battle of

01:55:51.760 --> 01:55:57.240
Olympus anyone well how about something else though that is kind of a big ish

01:55:57.240 --> 01:56:07.560
okay Hanabi festival yay but Nintendo raised some prices for some of their

01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:12.680
games ironclad is now a thousand we points instead of 900 and loadrunner is

01:56:12.680 --> 01:56:20.000
600 instead of 500 there's military madness for we wear which will be a

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:26.600
thousand we points and then the rest is DSI where pop island simply mahjong

01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:36.160
simply sudoku each of those will be 200 DSI points and then four travelers play

01:56:36.160 --> 01:56:40.480
Spanish which is a multiplayer game that teaches you Spanish and elementary

01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:50.320
masters being a fantasy card adventure both are 800 DSI points so they got a

01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:53.920
lot of the big stuff out last year but of course Rondo of blood is kind of the

01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:58.840
big one that everybody's like that means I don't have to worry about

01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:01.920
accidentally scratching my desk I wonder if that means it's gonna come out here

01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:05.160
too oh I know you're reading it for Europe and what they get but they

01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:08.400
sometimes get cooler stuff than we do so I hope it means we're gonna get it

01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:14.240
around the same time want it might be dark sakura it could be tomorrow it

01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:20.560
could be tomorrow I know I know I want next week to be here already not just

01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:23.360
because of packs not not this coming week but the week after not just because

01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:26.920
the PAX East but Microsoft Game Room I've seen some of the clips from my GDC

01:57:26.920 --> 01:57:30.680
for Microsoft Game Room looks looks kind of cool I'm excited to try here's my

01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:34.040
question though about that hobby festival those just because you guys

01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:38.280
are getting all excited and everything one of the years they did bring that

01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:43.720
stuff over here but not last year I don't think it was only in Europe well

01:57:43.720 --> 01:57:47.620
it seems like they don't bring all the games over here cuz well no I guess they

01:57:47.620 --> 01:57:51.800
did do a festival out of it because I want to say they brought sin and

01:57:51.800 --> 01:57:54.960
punishment over here which was a big deal because they in the back of their

01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:58.740
minds they knew the sequel was coming we didn't know that yet but they knew it

01:57:58.740 --> 01:58:05.560
was so they brought that out yeah I think marbles too did also like yeah I

01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:09.240
think you're right the original Mario 2 you're right yeah was part of that

01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:14.400
crap well maybe they'll do it again here but not gonna hold my breath either so

01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:17.200
we'll see a couple more stories for you guys then we're gonna get to the mailbag

01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:22.960
mailbag at orange lounge radio.com well this is kind of an interesting tie-in

01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:29.480
but apparently mafia 2 will feature vintage playboys that's right 2k games

01:58:29.480 --> 01:58:32.440
has announced that they've signed a license agreement with the Playboy

01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:40.400
magazine for I guess they're gonna have 50 of the vintage covers and centerfolds

01:58:40.400 --> 01:58:44.440
inside the game when it's released so I guess you'll see vintage playboys

01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:51.000
littered on the ground and stuff like that also I guess you know the Playboy

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:55.960
collectibles won't show up I guess until the later part of the game because I

01:58:55.960 --> 01:59:02.520
guess the game takes place during the 40s and 50s and apparently the magazine

01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:08.040
won't I guess merely be like a window dressing they're saying but I actually

01:59:08.040 --> 01:59:12.720
have the ability to collect virtual copies of the magazine so that's a

01:59:12.720 --> 01:59:18.160
Pokemon game worth playing so I guess you know like in the Grand Theft Auto

01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:21.960
games where you have hidden packages or in you know Grand Theft Auto 4 birds you have to

01:59:21.960 --> 01:59:28.160
kill this game you will have dirty magazines that you collect nice and

01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:32.680
they're that are they actual Playboy vintage covers that's gonna be the

01:59:32.680 --> 01:59:37.240
actual covers Wow so they're gonna I don't know if they have it says they

01:59:37.240 --> 01:59:39.800
have the centerfolds as well so I don't know if you get the cover in the

01:59:39.800 --> 01:59:45.720
centerfold it's a little bit of nudity for you but uh neat hey adding some tits

01:59:45.720 --> 01:59:48.640
to your game always makes it sell a few more copies so there you go and I do

01:59:48.640 --> 01:59:53.880
believe that they had a character from mafia 2 in the last digital fake game

01:59:53.880 --> 01:59:58.640
chick oh they still do that huh yeah these girls and it's retarded yeah a

01:59:58.640 --> 02:00:05.240
little silly all right on the PSP maybe this system can render some nice-looking

02:00:05.240 --> 02:00:09.120
titties I don't know that should be the question we ask about a new engine you

02:00:09.120 --> 02:00:12.480
know how we always say with a new peripheral what's the time to penis with

02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:15.680
new game engines we should always ask what's the time for realistic boobs I

02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:20.280
don't know anyhow I think this system is very capable of doing it it's the fire

02:00:20.280 --> 02:00:26.080
engine that's phyre engine right now this is a tool that's used for creating

02:00:26.080 --> 02:00:31.080
ps3 games it was used to make critter crunch flower shatter well apparently

02:00:31.080 --> 02:00:35.280
now this is going to be compatible with the PSP big announcement a game

02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:38.440
developers conference which makes sense because the people developing games want

02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:41.200
to know that they can make games like critter crunch on the PSP I gotta say

02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:45.760
flower awesome-looking game that is one of the most beautiful games you will

02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:50.560
play on a next-gen system period critter crunch looks like a freaking cartoon

02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:53.760
really well done so it's kind of exciting to hear that this phyre engine

02:00:53.760 --> 02:00:59.760
is coming to the PSP one of the VPS technology taji you kata or sorry you

02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:03.720
taka said phyre engine for PSP was developed in response to requests from

02:01:03.720 --> 02:01:07.200
the game developer community and we hope that the release of the PSP version

02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:11.280
demonstrates our commitment and support for game developers on all platforms

02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:16.040
begin counting down the time until critter crunch and flower are announced

02:01:16.040 --> 02:01:20.400
on the PSP because I'll bet you anything both of those games being as well

02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:25.920
received as they were getting PSP ports in a matter of three two one yeah wait

02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:31.720
for e3 anyhow now is the part of the show where dark soccer is gonna take an

02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:35.120
adventure into the mailbag she's gonna jump in pull out some emails and read

02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:42.720
them for you here the mailbag mailbag at orange lounge radio.com dark soccer who's

02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:48.560
emailing us this week two from Rob above this is now that the following terms are

02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:52.600
allowed in Xbox Live gamer tags lesbian gay bi transgender straight I think that

02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:57.000
Microsoft has the golden opportunity for avatar clothing and props of the LGBT

02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:02.200
it's not an official 2010 prediction but I'm pretty sure they will any takers or

02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:06.080
am I taking too much for granted in other news did you hear about Washington

02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:09.520
DC has made gay marriage legal next thing you know some guy will try to

02:02:09.520 --> 02:02:15.400
marry his virtual girlfriend oh wait yes I I did hear about DC making it legal so

02:02:15.400 --> 02:02:19.600
congratulations DC and I may I made a mistake because I tweeted about it when

02:02:19.600 --> 02:02:23.360
it happens and I was like what state's gonna be next come on guys it's time to

02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:26.320
get the other states on board and then I realized like literally five seconds

02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:31.440
after hitting submit I was like oh DC is not a state but still it's it's an

02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:35.800
important part of the nation obviously and very glad to hear that they have

02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:40.640
stopped marriage discrimination yep good for them as far as the other part of

02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:44.400
that the the part related to gaming more about how long before I can get a rainbow

02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:49.480
sticker a rainbow belt for my character I don't know I think a lot of it is

02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:53.960
about supply and demand and I don't know if there's just a huge demand for that I

02:02:53.960 --> 02:02:57.680
don't think that Microsoft's gonna be really trying to sell that anytime soon

02:02:57.680 --> 02:03:01.040
I don't know I think it would be a little while I just don't think there's

02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:05.560
enough out there in the avatar marketplace where they need that stuff

02:03:05.560 --> 02:03:09.800
right now I mean yeah they have sports jerseys but you know I don't know I

02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:14.160
don't then again they had the politically motivated icons a couple

02:03:14.160 --> 02:03:17.760
years ago when the oh eight election happened I want to say they had their

02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:22.480
own little like Xbox poll because there were Obama icons and McCain icons right

02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:26.520
am I crazy when there's some type of like unscientific poll they did like

02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:31.880
yeah I don't know I don't know if they'd want to do such a social issue on the

02:03:31.880 --> 02:03:37.800
marketplace I don't realistically see that happening well now also from the

02:03:37.800 --> 02:03:44.000
Disney parks log the monorails are going to feature Tron legacy art okay that's

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:48.720
pretty cool nice like all the Disney parks are gonna be Tron Trana time

02:03:48.720 --> 02:03:53.680
trying to tie looking at the Disney parks it's the it's Disney world oh wow

02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:58.320
that's so cool you see the monorails at Disneyland like just got redone not that

02:03:58.320 --> 02:04:01.920
long ago so I'm but I can't believe tell me this picture is not sweet oh that's

02:04:01.920 --> 02:04:04.760
right oh it's just like a little paint job on the outside yeah pretty cool

02:04:04.760 --> 02:04:09.320
though um yes me you know what I mean even cooler if they did

02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:15.760
we know be boy no but seriously though speaking of Tron in Disneyland because I

02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:19.800
can bring this back on point the coolest fucking ride I remember from when I was

02:04:19.800 --> 02:04:25.080
a kid the people mover featuring Tron it was you know they had the people mover

02:04:25.080 --> 02:04:27.800
which I had for years and years but in the early 80s when the movie came out

02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:31.840
there was a section of it that was the super speed tunnel where basically they

02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:36.320
projected imageries of Tron really fast on the wall so if it was a visual trick

02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:39.200
it was an optical illusion that made you feel like you were going like 60 miles

02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:42.600
an hour in this tunnel because it was like the light cycles going by real

02:04:42.600 --> 02:04:47.840
quick like bring that back Disneyland the fucking tracks are still sitting

02:04:47.840 --> 02:04:53.600
there not being used how awesome would it be if this Christmas you open it up

02:04:53.600 --> 02:04:59.200
for Tron problem is the people mover someone fell off of it and died then

02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:03.400
they their own damn fault and then they I understand yes and I totally agree

02:05:03.400 --> 02:05:06.880
with you it is their own damn fault that they fell out of the stupid thing and

02:05:06.880 --> 02:05:11.960
died then there was the rocket rods which were really super fast still had

02:05:11.960 --> 02:05:15.920
the Tron tunnel but it was like zoom through the Tron tunnel it is hard to

02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:22.440
see anything I never rode rocket rods sadly but someone also somehow managed

02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:28.000
to fall out of that thing and died so people are dumb that's what it comes

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:31.040
down to that's why they all the gondolas anymore because someone fell out of it

02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:36.600
and died it's always people acting like jackasses falling out of things and

02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:41.840
dying the chat room has a request for me real quick here honors like a genuine

02:05:41.840 --> 02:05:47.080
bona fide electrified six-car monorail what I say monorail what's it called

yes hopefully they involve monorails good morning orange house radio this is

02:06:55.960 --> 02:06:59.880
Jesus writing in again I have quite a few things to cover today so first I'd

02:06:59.880 --> 02:07:02.600
like to thank dark soccer for reading my previous selling email in this one as

02:07:02.600 --> 02:07:05.920
well I really appreciate it I am also sorry for any spelling errors or

02:07:05.920 --> 02:07:09.200
grammatical faults in my letters which there are undoubtedly many yeah but

02:07:09.200 --> 02:07:11.880
you're forgiven now on to more pressing matters

02:07:11.880 --> 02:07:18.120
okay ripper is the Swede I should be the other Swede since I am still just a

02:07:18.120 --> 02:07:23.280
private in the ol army oh don't give up like that come on where's my epic battle

02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:29.080
where's my sweet throw down okay fine a lot of respect goes out to a key

02:07:29.080 --> 02:07:32.640
ripper his ability to call in so often I'm still quite impressed he manages to

02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:37.480
stay up for so long every week anyways time for something that actually relates

02:07:37.480 --> 02:07:42.360
to gaming as we all know the world is in a state of economic turmoil hundreds and

02:07:42.360 --> 02:07:46.440
thousands of developers are being fired studios are getting shut down and the

02:07:46.440 --> 02:07:50.040
debate of piracy and DRM is getting more attention around the globe as we've

02:07:50.040 --> 02:07:55.560
heard on the last few shows but how is this impact impacting the gaming world

02:07:55.560 --> 02:08:00.600
on a larger scale I'll tell you how more sequels than ever are being pumped out

02:08:00.600 --> 02:08:03.440
in fear of bankruptcy and less money is being invested in creating new

02:08:03.440 --> 02:08:07.080
intellectual properties the reasoning is very simple and is often employed in the

02:08:07.080 --> 02:08:10.960
movie business using a successful brand name or franchise that is already well

02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:14.720
known will cost the publisher a lot less money to build up interest and then

02:08:14.720 --> 02:08:18.500
having to actually produce several ads and build a hype behind a new setting

02:08:18.500 --> 02:08:23.120
and new characters successful games usually have an amount of blind

02:08:23.120 --> 02:08:26.960
followers who will buy the next game in a series if the previous game was good

02:08:26.960 --> 02:08:30.720
which in turn means almost guaranteed turnover of all investments and profits

02:08:30.720 --> 02:08:34.800
for the publisher to prove my point I want each OLR member to try and think of

02:08:34.800 --> 02:08:41.760
the game that is near release that is based on a new IP now that might not

02:08:41.760 --> 02:08:45.560
have been too hard since you have had the new releases segments before mailbag

02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:51.280
but my point is that a large percentage of new games have to have a two or three

02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:55.800
in the name when will we get the next portal or Bioshock type of game that

02:08:55.800 --> 02:09:00.600
comes along and really blows people's minds one portal to talk to I know right

02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:04.840
what made both of those games so amazing was that there was no expectation of

02:09:04.840 --> 02:09:07.800
what the games would be about the storytelling and both these were

02:09:07.800 --> 02:09:12.320
innovated the protagonist intriguing in the setting unique which really made for

02:09:12.320 --> 02:09:16.680
a game experience like no other with this in mind isn't it sad that there is

02:09:16.680 --> 02:09:21.160
a Bioshock 2 already out in that portal 2 is on its way how we really reached

02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:26.200
solo that any new franchise gets 80 or more Metacritic score gets placed on the

02:09:26.200 --> 02:09:30.440
sequel bandwagon is this really what us gamers want I will have to say I am

02:09:30.440 --> 02:09:35.480
excited about portal 2 I guess I'm just point though yeah well I know I get the

02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:40.400
point but I do want more portal goodness I think though that some of us are just

02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:44.600
like we have such awesome experiences with some of these games that we want

02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:48.800
more it's a matter of whether they need to make the sequel or not like some

02:09:48.800 --> 02:09:53.120
sequels are actually pretty good and some sequels are just kind of we put it

02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:56.320
out because we want more money I have been hearing the most friendly feedback

02:09:56.320 --> 02:10:00.200
regarding Bioshock 2 that a lot of folks are complaining it does feel like a cash

02:10:00.200 --> 02:10:04.280
cow at the first game Bioshock was great but there have been some really good

02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:08.600
original game a little big plan I was talking about earlier Bayonetta Bayonetta

02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:11.600
was really well or the original Mass Effect I'm saying for sequels though oh

02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:14.900
but I mean even original IPs there's been a lot of really good ones in the

02:10:14.900 --> 02:10:19.280
past year blur looks like it's gonna be great you know there there's some

02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:26.720
second to to finish email out I guess I'm just ranting at this point so I will

02:10:26.720 --> 02:10:30.140
ask another question regarding new IPs when do you think Blizzard will release

02:10:30.140 --> 02:10:35.160
a game with a new IP soon I think they're working on one right now I think

02:10:35.160 --> 02:10:39.440
I I don't know maybe I'm putting the cart before a horse a little bit but I

02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:42.520
remember there were some rumors a while back that they were working on a new IP

02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:48.200
because they had Diablo Starcraft World of Warcraft and then another one I think

02:10:48.200 --> 02:10:52.760
once you see the spacecraft I think once you see the dust settle with

02:10:52.760 --> 02:10:58.940
Star Trek Star Trek Starcraft and the World of Warcraft cataclysm and you know

02:10:58.940 --> 02:11:03.160
Diablo 3 is kind of their focus I think you'll start to get some rumblings of

02:11:03.160 --> 02:11:08.440
what they're doing next and I my gut tells me it's gonna be an MMO and I'll

02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:12.080
go so far to say it's an MMO but not like a Warcraft MMO like something

02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:17.160
kind of different like a tabula rasa MMO you know how tabula rasa was like a

02:11:17.160 --> 02:11:21.120
shooter like I think they're gonna go a different route with the MMO why make a

02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:24.560
copy of Warcraft when they have Warcraft I think they're gonna go with an MMO

02:11:24.560 --> 02:11:32.840
that's different and that makes sense well um okay looking forward to to the

02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:36.480
show and your response is Jesus PS I will most likely be listening live to

02:11:36.480 --> 02:11:42.000
the next olr the one on March 21st call us yeah we need maybe we should have

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.680
our match came off that week I don't know we'll see we maybe I could plan a

02:11:44.680 --> 02:11:48.160
match game oh you're not gonna be here next no I'll be here I'll be late oh

02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:52.360
you'll be late okay I'm gonna go to a Seder okay so well then what time do you

02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:56.600
get back from those about seven eight maybe earlier all right cool then we

02:11:56.600 --> 02:12:00.800
should be able to do a match game in part B yeah hello olr okay here's the

02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:03.760
deal about a month ago I wrote in about Silent Hill shattered memories in Dark

02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:08.560
Sakura the kind living woman she is I know told me flat-out to play one of the

02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:12.720
originals now I'm getting to my point here I bought Silent Hill 2 just a

02:12:12.720 --> 02:12:17.560
couple of days ago but I could have gotten a Silent Hill for the room so I

02:12:17.560 --> 02:12:20.560
was wondering did I pass up a great game for a load of crap are they both equally

02:12:20.560 --> 02:12:24.280
good and should I just shut the hell up now um they're different kinds of good

02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:28.320
Silent Hill 4 is a very different kind of game sorry what was the other game I

02:12:28.320 --> 02:12:32.720
heard the room it got Silent Hill 2 but passed up Silent Hill 4 to get it I

02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:37.080
think you made the good choice I think yeah if you haven't played either I

02:12:37.080 --> 02:12:40.120
think you made the better choice with two I think two is the one that's very

02:12:40.120 --> 02:12:43.960
iconic of the series although a lot of folks are partial to three and the

02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:49.040
original as well I personally am partial to three and I still say play two first

02:12:49.040 --> 02:12:53.720
between the yeah I mean four is not bad by any means I think it got raised a

02:12:53.720 --> 02:12:57.560
little bit by critics too harsh I think it's better than that but I think also

02:12:57.560 --> 02:13:00.760
it's a little obvious that four was intended to be a different game in the

02:13:00.760 --> 02:13:06.840
beginning yeah it because as far as how they're related three is more of a sequel

02:13:06.840 --> 02:13:13.560
to one and four follow some of the story points from two well four was just gonna

02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:17.500
be the room yeah it was a new horror franchise they were doing called the

02:13:17.500 --> 02:13:21.040
room and they ended up you know it's kind of Silent Hill ish so let's make it

02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:26.640
Silent Hill but it worked it really did work it did it it was a good game I a

02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:31.060
horrible horribly underrated by the community at home the part with big head

02:13:31.060 --> 02:13:35.440
good oh my god I screamed like a little girl when I played that I think Logie

02:13:35.440 --> 02:13:39.120
was there and I felt I remember falling down and there were these big monster

02:13:39.120 --> 02:13:42.760
two-headed baby things in the well water prison or whatever and I screamed like a

02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:45.960
girl look he's what the hell are you doing like I'm playing Silent Hill and

02:13:45.960 --> 02:13:52.600
it's Gary um okay so yeah they're both equally good but you did a good thing by

02:13:52.600 --> 02:13:57.360
buying Silent Hill 2 on another note my friend brought up a good point today

02:13:57.360 --> 02:14:01.120
about Max Payne 3 which brings me to another question do you guys know

02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:04.080
whether or not they're going to bring back the comic panels for cutscenes are

02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:09.960
we all fucked for that well I think I don't know yeah a little little early to

02:14:09.960 --> 02:14:14.640
tell honestly but hey you could always have the digital comics on PSP you never

02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:18.020
know they may make a comic out of it specifically for a PSP it would

02:14:18.020 --> 02:14:21.840
certainly lend itself well to that well I thank you for reading my email and if

02:14:21.840 --> 02:14:26.440
you didn't why the fuck not your loyal listener I'll just say I'm not gonna do

02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:30.280
your whole name Haseo from northern Minnesota the land of the oh my god it's

02:14:30.280 --> 02:14:34.840
so fucking windy I'm sorry muddy sorry I like listeners to get a little bit of

02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:39.960
attitude with us and if you didn't read this email why the fuck no I like emails

02:14:39.960 --> 02:14:46.440
to get a little sassy with us oh we got another did he text us really quick yeah

02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:52.960
okay okay one more message is there a way to get memory from a ps2 I guess

02:14:52.960 --> 02:14:58.620
memory card to a ps1 I can't because those are a bitch to find without going

02:14:58.620 --> 02:15:07.200
online to PSP and onto a ps3 without the memory card adapter onto a ps3 no I

02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:12.320
think you need the adapter if you're going from ps1 to ps2 a ps2 will read

02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:18.300
the cards from one and you can even put that data on a ps2 card but only ask

02:15:18.300 --> 02:15:24.360
like a carrier you can't put a ps2 card in a ps1 under any reason so the only

02:15:24.360 --> 02:15:28.020
thing you could do you could put a ps1 card in a ps2 but unfortunately I ain't

02:15:28.020 --> 02:15:33.000
gonna do you a lick of good without the the transmitter cable unfortunately

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:38.720
that's just the way it is oopsies if you I you might be able to I don't know if

02:15:38.720 --> 02:15:41.400
this will work you might have to do some research on this you might be able to

02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:45.540
get something that lets you put your ps1 data on the PC and then you could use a

02:15:45.540 --> 02:15:51.440
USB stick to do it that I think is possible but I can't remember yeah but

02:15:51.440 --> 02:15:55.920
saves on the PC had different formats and stuff so it might not work hmm

02:15:55.920 --> 02:15:59.400
because remember there's like dextra I formats and stuff I know this from back

02:15:59.400 --> 02:16:04.040
in the day when I'd used to do edit heck you'll just you might have to spend the

02:16:04.040 --> 02:16:08.760
money to get the cable dude sorry all right well let's get into some angst

02:16:08.760 --> 02:16:12.440
sometimes there are things that happen in the world that make us angry and we

02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:16.060
always do this segment every week to just just get it out of our system so we

02:16:16.060 --> 02:16:38.680
can be the happy host you know I was really trying to think of one okay this

02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:43.900
is gonna require some backstory and it is a little bit of family goings-on for

02:16:43.900 --> 02:16:54.220
me my my brother's girlfriend and her mother were found dead on Monday in

02:16:54.220 --> 02:17:01.280
Silver Hill Alabama so if anyone in the area who knows them don't you know say

02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:08.260
you heard anything well I mean I just it's not I guess so much of a fuck you

02:17:08.260 --> 02:17:15.680
type of thing it's just more of a regrettable thing I actually have to say

02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:20.800
everyone and Nina they actually don't know if it the whole theory is that it's

02:17:20.800 --> 02:17:24.960
carbon monoxide poisoning what killed them in there and at the mobile home

02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:31.240
they lived in because the last anyone heard anything was Friday and Matt

02:17:31.240 --> 02:17:35.260
didn't find out no one found out until Monday when they found them but I'm just

02:17:35.260 --> 02:17:40.960
saying there's no excuse not to have a carbon monoxide tester even if that

02:17:40.960 --> 02:17:43.920
wasn't the cause that it's inconclusive right now they're treating it as a

02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:48.880
homicide but even so if it was carbon monoxide or some type of gas monitoring

02:17:48.880 --> 02:17:52.420
or anything there really shouldn't be any excuse if there's not a way to

02:17:52.420 --> 02:17:57.720
monitor that I'd say everyone your your homes and your health and your lives are

02:17:57.720 --> 02:18:01.960
that important you should invest a little bit monitoring don't they sell

02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:05.480
and if they don't why not smoke detectors that double as carbon monoxide

02:18:05.480 --> 02:18:09.280
they do it's a good thing to have you know how they regulate smoke detectors

02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:14.120
in public they should be regulating the multi detectors people with smoke in the

02:18:14.120 --> 02:18:20.520
house they turn off smoke detectors I know I know I know it's and you know

02:18:20.520 --> 02:18:26.520
especially a lot of the manufacturing with some it was some of those mobile

02:18:26.520 --> 02:18:31.400
homes are not always up to standard it's always very important that they be

02:18:31.400 --> 02:18:39.480
checked out you know is I mean my brother's girlfriend she was 18 and her

02:18:39.480 --> 02:18:46.200
mom was in her 50s and both way too young to you know well it's very

02:18:46.200 --> 02:18:52.400
unfortunate I'm sorry to hear it yeah and and not my brother Matthew he's was

02:18:52.400 --> 02:18:55.320
a bit of a mess when I talked to him but he seems to be doing better well yeah I

02:18:55.320 --> 02:19:00.940
would be too so can't blame him so let that tragedy be awareness for everybody

02:19:00.940 --> 02:19:04.660
it's no joke just like you know unfortunately I had a tragedy where I

02:19:04.660 --> 02:19:08.500
lost someone h1n1 last year it's no joke some of these things you're about no

02:19:08.500 --> 02:19:13.840

things in Stockton though like search Craigslist for my okay good all right

02:21:44.920 --> 02:21:49.320
um my f you I'll try to keep a brief I I've had to make a very tough decision

02:21:49.320 --> 02:21:53.880
over the weekend and so you know like with any decision you have those two

02:21:53.880 --> 02:21:56.760
guys that sit on your shoulder not necessarily the angel and the devil but

02:21:56.760 --> 02:22:00.800
the you know advocate and for one side the advocate for other that yell and

02:22:00.800 --> 02:22:04.760
argue back and forth so although I'm fairly confident in this decision I'm

02:22:04.760 --> 02:22:09.680
about to make I say f you to the the guy that sits on my shoulder saying are you

02:22:09.680 --> 02:22:16.920
sure are you sure we could get you a big boozy to shoot him with but then I would

02:22:16.920 --> 02:22:20.160
shoot myself there's a how I feel about guns you're saying an F you to the

02:22:20.160 --> 02:22:29.000
grant the granny questions do you wish to save are you sure is that your final

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:34.160
answer if you to Regis Philbin for making that a pop culture thing if you

02:22:34.160 --> 02:22:39.360
Regis all right couple more news stories for you guys and then like it or not the

02:22:39.360 --> 02:22:43.720
skyline will be open one eight seven seven game olr because it is the show

02:22:43.720 --> 02:22:48.880
where every gamer has a voice Loki Activision and Fendi Ward are asking

02:22:48.880 --> 02:22:53.320
you do you suffer from apathy that's right they're playing on releasing the

02:22:53.320 --> 02:22:59.800
first map pack for modern warfare 2 becoming tax box live on March 30th no

02:22:59.800 --> 02:23:04.680
word yet when PlayStation 3 will be getting it but apparently it's gonna be

02:23:04.680 --> 02:23:09.960
a timed exclusive type of thing what will the map pack include well it will

02:23:09.960 --> 02:23:16.440
include a couple new maps some that are to call I guess two of them are quality

02:23:16.440 --> 02:23:24.040
for modern warfare 1 remakes also apparently there's gonna be let's see

02:23:24.040 --> 02:23:29.120
here some other ones including a bailout which is a multi-level apartment complex

02:23:29.120 --> 02:23:34.720
that sounds kind of cool storm and open industrial park littered with heavy

02:23:34.720 --> 02:23:41.200
machinery salvages snowy junkyard fortified with stacked debris and crushed

02:23:41.200 --> 02:23:45.760
cars and I guess two of the maps that are getting remade from called before

02:23:45.760 --> 02:23:50.880
include crash which is against a war-torn urban environment and overgrown

02:23:50.880 --> 02:24:02.280
which is a massive dry creek bed kind of neat all right lots of fun modern

02:24:02.280 --> 02:24:07.000
warfare developments there I'm hoping actually none of those map packs I see

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:11.520
the heads of infinity more say where the was the content designed before the

02:24:11.520 --> 02:24:15.840
heads of infinity Ward were axed I'm assuming no it's kind of funny they're

02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:23.120
all you gotta love the the name of the download content is the stimulus package

02:24:23.120 --> 02:24:29.440
is if that's not a slap in the face I don't know what is oh did you and they

02:24:29.440 --> 02:24:33.800
should have called it infinity Ward you know I didn't realize this because I

02:24:33.800 --> 02:24:37.360
don't really play games like modern warfare I mean not that they're bad

02:24:37.360 --> 02:24:41.520
they're just games I don't really play I had heard that the credits in that game

02:24:41.520 --> 02:24:45.320
are kind of funny because like all the studio credits you know they scroll by

02:24:45.320 --> 02:24:48.160
or whatever then when it gets to the credits for Activision it speeds up and

02:24:48.160 --> 02:24:52.080
they run by like eight times as fast and then it goes back to normal like there's

02:24:52.080 --> 02:24:55.760
always that tongue-in-cheek we don't like Activision thing going on those

02:24:55.760 --> 02:25:00.440
games I heard that on another show I thought that was funny all right uh

02:25:00.440 --> 02:25:05.680
let's how about some news on monkey Island monkey Island is coming to PSN

02:25:05.680 --> 02:25:12.160
Mac telltale and instant action I guess let's see the game store of course

02:25:12.160 --> 02:25:16.160
instant action calm would be the other thing we're talking about there it's the

02:25:16.160 --> 02:25:20.760
special edition of the secret of monkey Island and it's coming out that's pretty

02:25:20.760 --> 02:25:24.520
cool though I think a lot of people have been waiting for it on PSN and of course

02:25:24.520 --> 02:25:29.760
the Mac so there you go the island is sweet mm-hmm and by the way the sequel

02:25:29.760 --> 02:25:35.760
the secret of monkey Island to even more sweet coming out on Xbox Live Arcade PSN

02:25:35.760 --> 02:25:40.920
PC and the iPhone though the ending is really strange well there it is the

02:25:40.920 --> 02:25:45.000
secret of monkey Island to coming out this summer on all those systems so it's

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:49.960
not quite the special edition just so you know it's just some new controls on

02:25:49.960 --> 02:25:58.120
the classic game but still still what a good what a good game good times all

02:25:58.120 --> 02:26:02.160
right I guess that's it for now should we try to open up the Skype line and

02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:07.680
take some calls sure all right wide up one eight seven seven game olr our

02:26:07.680 --> 02:26:12.840
username on Skype is orange lounge radio Skype line is open for business while we

02:26:12.840 --> 02:26:15.440
wait for some calls because it takes about a minute for the chatters to get

02:26:15.440 --> 02:26:18.080
the message Loki have any last-minute stories for us or I don't know dark

02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:25.520
soccer you have anything okay then Loki I'm sure I do and I'm just trying to

02:26:25.520 --> 02:26:31.080
navigate myself towards the webpage where said stories would be um let's see

02:26:31.080 --> 02:26:36.360
here let's talk about guitar freaks XG apparently it's been released I'm

02:26:36.360 --> 02:26:39.880
assuming in Japan because I sure as hell haven't seen one over here then again

02:26:39.880 --> 02:26:45.720
I've been an arcade in forever but yes guitar freaks Romania XG has been

02:26:45.720 --> 02:26:51.640
released in Japan and of course you may remember XG is the one where they have

02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:55.320
the extra buttons on the guitar and then the drums are a little bit fancier and

02:26:55.320 --> 02:27:01.520
whatnot but uh but is the game fun I don't know well let's go to the phones

02:27:01.520 --> 02:27:06.340
hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hi this act F hi act F what's on

02:27:06.340 --> 02:27:11.520
your mind our friendly neighborhood Mexican how are you pretty fine I just

02:27:11.520 --> 02:27:18.520
wanted to ask a quick question about the ps3 yes maybe look Loki can answer this

02:27:18.520 --> 02:27:28.180
I've been hearing and reading in forums that there there are ps3 shortages yeah

02:27:28.180 --> 02:27:33.920
there's rumors going around that I've been hearing it's basically they're

02:27:33.920 --> 02:27:39.880
trying to sandbag their numbers for the next financial year because even right

02:27:39.880 --> 02:27:43.440
now God of War 3 there were shortage problems and there's also rumors that

02:27:43.440 --> 02:27:49.080
there's a disc pressing problem for God of War 3 because I know art we got

02:27:49.080 --> 02:27:54.720
shorted pretty bad as well as everyone else did apparently but it's been

02:27:54.720 --> 02:28:00.280
anything first party Sony's been hard to get for like the whole year so far and

02:28:00.280 --> 02:28:04.440
it's supposed to be a lot better in April when their new financial year

02:28:04.440 --> 02:28:07.920
starts so that they're basically trying to suck as much sales as they can to

02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:11.400
next year to make it look better let me jump in for a minute here because yeah I

02:28:11.400 --> 02:28:15.920
just to support what you're saying I got a text message when ps3 mageddon was

02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:20.560
going on and it was one of my friends who I guess booted up her ps3 and it

02:28:20.560 --> 02:28:24.960
was right when the issue happened so nobody knew that there was a time and

02:28:24.960 --> 02:28:28.780
date issue going on and she thought the thing was broken so she went to Best Buy

02:28:28.780 --> 02:28:32.380
and text messaged me and said dude you might want to know for your show Best Buy

02:28:32.380 --> 02:28:36.640
has no PlayStation threes in stock and their computer has one in the nation

02:28:36.640 --> 02:28:41.260
located in a store and I was like I kind of took that as a really type of thing

02:28:41.260 --> 02:28:44.320
and I didn't like I got the text messages after the show so I didn't even

02:28:44.320 --> 02:28:47.080
really give it a second thought but it does sound like there's some type of

02:28:47.080 --> 02:28:54.480
shortage going on strange yeah I thought it was related to the the apocalypse

02:28:54.480 --> 02:28:59.960
thing that happened on February 28 no it's nothing to do with that it's just

02:28:59.960 --> 02:29:04.960
they've been out for a while and usually if there's some sort of time period

02:29:04.960 --> 02:29:08.760
right after you know the fourth quarter that they're trying to catch up because

02:29:08.760 --> 02:29:12.440
they basically you know at least on a distribution side they try to ship

02:29:12.440 --> 02:29:14.960
everything to retailers and the retailers leave them on their shelves

02:29:14.960 --> 02:29:20.440
and that's that I want to say though it's a blessing in some ways that that

02:29:20.440 --> 02:29:24.640
happened when ps3 Magetta and happened because think about how many people

02:29:24.640 --> 02:29:28.960
might have done what my friend did almost did and saying my ps3 stopped

02:29:28.960 --> 02:29:31.960
working guess it's time for me to get a new one and actually goes out and buys

02:29:31.960 --> 02:29:37.480
a new one and then oh it was just a 24-hour issue shit you know like well

02:29:37.480 --> 02:29:40.840
you could always return it I guess so but you know some stores take a fee for

02:29:40.840 --> 02:29:44.740
that and stuff so it's maybe a blessing in disguise that there were hardly any

02:29:44.740 --> 02:29:48.960
ps3s on shelves to get so people couldn't have that knee-jerk reaction

02:29:48.960 --> 02:29:53.880
of oh I'll just get a new ps3 probably thank gosh or else Sony might have been

02:29:53.880 --> 02:29:56.840
in some bigger doo-doo than they were but you notice how most people already

02:29:56.840 --> 02:30:01.760
forgot that that happened already already passed it we've moved on

02:30:01.760 --> 02:30:06.000
interesting Bob coffee in our chat room chat dot orange on twitter.com piping in

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:07.720
Walmart hasn't gotten any in a while either

02:30:07.720 --> 02:30:12.160
giovide says my targets been out for three weeks so definitely not just a

02:30:12.160 --> 02:30:15.320
best buy thing it does sound like there is some truth to this rumor but you

02:30:15.320 --> 02:30:19.160
watch if if all sudden in April they start having tons of them everywhere

02:30:19.160 --> 02:30:23.680
that's why because they were sandbagging them really I didn't think about it that

02:30:23.680 --> 02:30:26.920
way that's a really that's the rumors Nintendo doing something like that too

02:30:26.920 --> 02:30:30.560
or are they still saying oh well I don't know you're gonna hear a lot more stuff

02:30:30.560 --> 02:30:34.320
about Sony this week because destination PlayStation is happening now that's the

02:30:34.320 --> 02:30:37.920
retail only event but there's always people that manage to sneak their way in

02:30:37.920 --> 02:30:42.240
moles and stuff of course yeah because we have our people it's kind of bad that

02:30:42.240 --> 02:30:45.640
that happened it's happening right now it's considering that there's Final

02:30:45.640 --> 02:30:52.160
Fantasy 13 and God of War coming out next week so I don't know why they well

02:30:52.160 --> 02:30:58.200
you already explained it but I I would expect them to at least put a little

02:30:58.200 --> 02:31:02.800
more of the consoles out there in the market keep in mind though act F Sony

02:31:02.800 --> 02:31:06.720
lost a lot of oomph and people running out to buy a ps3 for Final Fantasy 13

02:31:06.720 --> 02:31:11.000
when it jumped ship to 360 as well and you know like I've mentioned earlier in

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:14.360
the night I think it was over on Bobby show but you know there really is no

02:31:14.360 --> 02:31:19.080
reason to run out and buy a ps3 if you already have a 360 for Final Fantasy 13

02:31:19.080 --> 02:31:22.760
just get it on the 360 the differences are not major enough to necessitate the

02:31:22.760 --> 02:31:27.480
change but God of War 3 now you can't get that anywhere else so yeah I think

02:31:27.480 --> 02:31:31.700
you make a good point it seems really strange that Sony would not want God of

02:31:31.700 --> 02:31:34.920
War 3 to be moving because that that's a system seller for some people it really

02:31:34.920 --> 02:31:39.720
is I know they just figured that they're gonna sell those copies it's just if

02:31:39.720 --> 02:31:46.320
they don't sell them right now it's no big deal but we'll see I mean well act

02:31:46.320 --> 02:31:48.760
F we gotta let you go so we can get more calls do you have any other thoughts for

02:31:48.760 --> 02:31:54.760

02:32:49.040 --> 02:32:56.100
five minutes ago you know last week up issued these everything with his one

02:32:56.100 --> 02:33:04.360
system mean that they won't jerk off this kind of screw them over yeah well

02:33:04.360 --> 02:33:10.740
you know I try calling the number dollar day you know at least all the day the

02:33:10.740 --> 02:33:17.840
number was working if you know if he doesn't mind I would like to give more

02:33:17.840 --> 02:33:23.840
constructive criticism for me oh wait hold on Loki Loki are you willing to

02:33:23.840 --> 02:33:27.120
accept some constructive criticism yeah sure why not all right then go ahead

02:33:27.120 --> 02:33:34.120
yeah yeah I know this is kind of some somewhat harsh but I I could have seen

02:33:34.120 --> 02:33:42.520
this coming a mile away for a couple couple reasons if I put Lussy on

02:33:42.520 --> 02:33:48.760
Craigslist which is practically the ghetto of the Internet you know you

02:33:48.760 --> 02:33:54.320
hear reports you know other news by Craigslist practically every other day

02:33:54.320 --> 02:33:59.840
but the personal ads are hilarious that's true well hold on let me give

02:33:59.840 --> 02:34:03.640
Loki a chance to defend himself why did you go to the bowels of the internet I

02:34:03.640 --> 02:34:06.320
mean well I don't know I mean there there are there is 4chan because

02:34:06.320 --> 02:34:10.320
Craigslist Craigslist is kind of in that same you know colony area of the

02:34:10.320 --> 02:34:15.600
internet what made you decide to go there to get your needs basically

02:34:15.600 --> 02:34:19.400
because and you know really looking at it now I could probably just done a

02:34:19.400 --> 02:34:26.440
j-tag install myself but the thing is I wanted to install the cyclot the the

02:34:26.440 --> 02:34:32.440
Cygnus to mod ship in there and that's a lot more difficult to install versus you

02:34:32.440 --> 02:34:37.800
know the just a j-tag a j-tag I mean shit I could I could do that I mean that

02:34:37.800 --> 02:34:43.040
it's like seven solder points and that's it and they're big but the reason why I

02:34:43.040 --> 02:34:46.120
went in Craigslist and stuff like eBay although I lucked out on eBay because

02:34:46.120 --> 02:34:49.120
someone sold it cuz eBay they're not allowed to sell that stuff you can't

02:34:49.120 --> 02:34:53.000
sell modded consoles you can't sell mod chips you can't sell anything like that

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:57.160
every now and then stuff slips through where you can buy that stuff thankfully

02:34:57.160 --> 02:35:03.000
I was able to buy one of those and really it wouldn't have been a big deal

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:09.400
to go you know testing why should done is gone should have just not let the

02:35:09.400 --> 02:35:14.360
console should have just gone with the car did he try to talk you into it like

02:35:14.360 --> 02:35:17.240
okay buddy all you know just come back in a couple hours and I'll have your

02:35:17.240 --> 02:35:20.600
console all done it wasn't even that it was like 30 minutes like I was gonna go

02:35:20.600 --> 02:35:28.320
eat and whose idea was it to leave his but you know I could see that where that

02:35:28.320 --> 02:35:31.920
would be something you know we're yeah when you're in that I mean yeah I

02:35:31.920 --> 02:35:36.240
understand it was 2020 but when you're in the moment and you're like okay I

02:35:36.240 --> 02:35:39.800
kind of trust this guy he's got his phone lots of for me from Craigslist

02:35:39.800 --> 02:35:43.240
before and it's been fine yeah and and to be fair although I'm joking about it

02:35:43.240 --> 02:35:47.840
being you know the bells the internet I I've seen job postings and stuff work

02:35:47.840 --> 02:35:52.240
on there's people on great companies posted availabilities and Craigslist so

02:35:52.240 --> 02:35:57.600
there are useful purposes I think if if as far as it goes with like services and

02:35:57.600 --> 02:36:01.040
stuff like that you just have to be careful as far as like you know

02:36:01.040 --> 02:36:05.760
especially with adult services for the love of God if you're gonna seek adult

02:36:05.760 --> 02:36:10.000
services on Craigslist you not only need to use protect you need to use like

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:14.080
three methods of protection all at once and that's assuming that it is actually

02:36:14.080 --> 02:36:17.580
somebody and not just a police sting yeah and then you're gonna want to bay

02:36:17.580 --> 02:36:22.160
them bleach honestly yeah but you know no seriously you know it's just you know

02:36:22.160 --> 02:36:26.240
some stupid things and what you need to do obviously if you're getting you know

02:36:26.240 --> 02:36:31.080
some services done online you know where you're gonna get something taken for you

02:36:31.080 --> 02:36:36.440
a legitimate person would give you like some sort of receipt you would you would

02:36:36.440 --> 02:36:40.160
have an address you wouldn't you know go to an address and he'd be waiting

02:36:40.160 --> 02:36:45.040
outside of like I there's a lot of red flags like for example the address that

02:36:45.040 --> 02:36:50.400
he gave me you know it's an apartment complex it's not not a house I thought

02:36:50.400 --> 02:36:53.560
it was a house I was like okay well that guy's address you know where's he gonna

02:36:53.560 --> 02:36:58.160
go you know it's a house but knows apartment complex where his friend

02:36:58.160 --> 02:37:02.240
probably lived and let her yeah who knows but he has this down to a science

02:37:02.240 --> 02:37:05.120
he ripped you off he'll rip someone else up my question is what's he doing with

02:37:05.120 --> 02:37:09.120
all these 360s I don't know probably selling them all right let me fuck drugs

02:37:09.120 --> 02:37:13.520
who knows it's a spazz nator I'm sorry yeah I was good yeah I was about to say

02:37:13.520 --> 02:37:20.240
the same thing for at least 10 to 15 years and now well now throughout the

02:37:20.240 --> 02:37:26.680
country not just my area or even just your area councils especially when

02:37:26.680 --> 02:37:34.760
they're still at the $250 to $300 range are really really big with seed they

02:37:34.760 --> 02:37:42.640
take those $250 to $300 console deal them turn around turn around and sell them

02:37:42.640 --> 02:37:49.600
for 50 to $100 and Dell or just trade them straight out for drugs whether

02:37:49.600 --> 02:37:55.680
their drug of choice happen happen you never know and it's a bummer with since

02:37:55.680 --> 02:38:00.760
Xbox has the ability to lock out your console when you you know when you do

02:38:00.760 --> 02:38:04.120
something naughty and expose life it's kind of a pity they don't have a type of

02:38:04.120 --> 02:38:08.060
service where you could call in and find out where your 360 is or who's

02:38:08.060 --> 02:38:10.520
connecting to the internet and I mean granted they don't want to help people

02:38:10.520 --> 02:38:14.280
like Loki but some people get their 360s legitimately stolen out of their home

02:38:14.280 --> 02:38:17.000
like I remember spazz nator weren't you the guy that had your ps3 taken right

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:26.200
out of your house yeah yeah yeah and oh well I lean off Bob back in 2003

02:38:26.200 --> 02:38:34.280
literally just as the calories switch over from July to August two guys

02:38:34.280 --> 02:38:44.600
barged into my apartment building and it's going by PlayStation 2 I called the

02:38:44.600 --> 02:38:50.800
police immediately but you know unfortunately you know with buffer

02:38:50.800 --> 02:38:56.720
police I hate to see it you know what there's like a whole stash of jelly

02:38:56.720 --> 02:39:06.120
filled bullets it's hard to track to because there's not like unique license

02:39:06.120 --> 02:39:09.440
plates or whatever but there is I mean there's a serial number I have the

02:39:09.440 --> 02:39:14.640
serial number but it's a bummer you can't track the way it does it's a bummer Xbox

02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:19.360
punch in serial number and you know here's the thing tells you where it's

02:39:19.360 --> 02:39:23.920
the guy knew what he was doing as far as j-tagging stuff because he knew what he

02:39:23.920 --> 02:39:28.120
was talking about but like he probably not only runs a service he probably mod

02:39:28.120 --> 02:39:32.200
your stolen 360 and sells it well here's the thing and I don't really have a

02:39:32.200 --> 02:39:35.920
problem of 360 was stolen I have a problem that I waited you know four

02:39:35.920 --> 02:39:41.240
hours in Stockton don't waste my time exactly I'm like if you're the DCC to

02:39:41.240 --> 02:39:45.840
just mug me you know seriously if he's gonna steal my system just don't respond

02:39:45.840 --> 02:39:50.080
back to any of my phone calls at all instead of like dragging on for four

02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:54.200
fucking hours okay because that was really the issue I have 360 consoles I

02:39:54.200 --> 02:39:57.920
don't really give a crap if one of them goes away it's it's just an inconvenience

02:39:57.920 --> 02:40:02.520
for me to sit there for four fucking hours in a car waiting for somebody I

02:40:02.520 --> 02:40:05.640
gotta wrap up here and let's fascinating in his final thoughts cuz we had to get

02:40:05.640 --> 02:40:07.800
some more calls but I do want to read this comment from chat cuz it's funny

02:40:07.800 --> 02:40:11.400
Brad from pod culture says this is why my apartment is protected by the sword

02:40:11.400 --> 02:40:15.360

02:40:15.360 --> 02:40:17.400
sword in the oil our studio okay maybe not

02:40:17.400 --> 02:40:21.660
dar Sakura might have a gun but she knows not to tell me seriously I have

02:40:21.660 --> 02:40:26.580
knives I've had my ex I have had all my airsoft guns stolen that was worth way

02:40:26.580 --> 02:40:30.600
more than this stupid 360 and like I just let it roll right off me it's you

02:40:30.600 --> 02:40:34.520
know it's a 360 whatever you know I'd be screaming I got it's all right I got

02:40:34.520 --> 02:40:37.120
four more they're broken so I gotta let's pass nator wrap up because we gotta

02:40:37.120 --> 02:40:40.680
get more calls spasm nator thank you for the lively discussion inspiration do you

02:40:40.680 --> 02:40:45.800
have any other lots for our listeners tonight nothing comes to mind nothing

02:40:45.800 --> 02:40:52.440
they'll take five seconds or less but I'll I'll talk to Loki about this you

02:40:52.440 --> 02:40:57.800
should wear your eyes throughout the weekend like live or on Twitter or

02:40:57.800 --> 02:41:03.400
whatever so just be careful he might mess with you like he was messing with

02:41:03.400 --> 02:41:06.640
cheeseburger oh that was just earlier and hey I can't believe he got so

02:41:06.640 --> 02:41:10.160
confused by and I was just like he must have me confused the other Loki you're

02:41:10.160 --> 02:41:12.840
so rude you know all right all right take care of spasm nator thanks for the

02:41:12.840 --> 02:41:16.860
call have a good one yep I gotta ask spasm nator if he's watching the tester

02:41:16.860 --> 02:41:21.440
because he's a big Sony fan I mean usually he'll cut he'll call in although

02:41:21.440 --> 02:41:24.300
he I don't know about anymore because I know he's been having his issue with

02:41:24.300 --> 02:41:29.440
Sony's lately but I gotta ask him if he's been watching that because it seems

02:41:29.440 --> 02:41:33.040
like as a Sony fan maybe that's something he's into I don't know I can't

02:41:33.040 --> 02:41:37.480
believe I'm admitting I've actually been watching the tester it's not terrible

02:41:37.480 --> 02:41:43.920
I'm gonna file it under the Tron and showgirls category it's it's so bad it's

02:41:43.920 --> 02:41:47.680
kind of good I can't explain it and seriously the whole reason I put they

02:41:47.680 --> 02:41:51.120
got the guy's phone number and email cuz I know that the police aren't gonna do

02:41:51.120 --> 02:41:53.720
anything they're not gonna be able to do anything because they don't have a name

02:41:53.720 --> 02:41:57.400
they don't have an actual law they just they just have it so at least at the

02:41:57.400 --> 02:42:00.920
very the very least it'll make them think maybe twice about like doing

02:42:00.920 --> 02:42:03.440
something like that because it's really inconvenient I've got to get to the

02:42:03.440 --> 02:42:06.880
phones guys the phones are lighting up tonight like there are so look I have a

02:42:06.880 --> 02:42:11.040
screen full of people trying to get in thank you guys so much I'm just trying

02:42:11.040 --> 02:42:15.300
to answer these as fast as I can hire an orange launch radio who's this this is

02:42:15.300 --> 02:42:19.840
Amiga 777 Amiga 777 what is on your mind my friend

02:42:19.840 --> 02:42:25.960
hi I just like us to send a public apology to some of the listeners from

02:42:25.960 --> 02:42:29.600
Japan that might have been listening last week hmm I guess about some of the

02:42:29.600 --> 02:42:34.840
things that I said about you know the whole PlayStation 2 birthday 10-year

02:42:34.840 --> 02:42:46.000
thing yeah um it actually you know ps2 is alright it it um there there are a

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:49.280
lot of things you know kind of going back to that question you're like what

02:42:49.280 --> 02:42:58.560
could the Dreamcast it done better and so going back on that um well I could I

02:42:58.560 --> 02:43:03.920
probably enter the end to that question maybe toward in um let's see October you

02:43:03.920 --> 02:43:09.120
know which is technically the the month that it came out the ps2 came out here

02:43:09.120 --> 02:43:16.720
and now the u.s. okay no amiga I remember your call and I don't I don't

02:43:16.720 --> 02:43:20.360
think you have to go out of your way to apologize it was your own opinion and

02:43:20.360 --> 02:43:26.120
what-have-you and last week was a little bit crazy anyway but um you know I I

02:43:26.120 --> 02:43:29.280
think you kind of bring up a point though that certainly the PlayStation 2

02:43:29.280 --> 02:43:33.160
saw levels of success in other countries that may not have even been you know

02:43:33.160 --> 02:43:40.680
kind of duplicated here or what have you okay that was just one thing those on my

02:43:40.680 --> 02:43:45.080
mind all right well you know what it it it takes a real man to man up to an

02:43:45.080 --> 02:43:48.240
apology although I don't think you needed to apologize he had a perfectly

02:43:48.240 --> 02:43:53.160
fine opinion but that's that's fine you you said your piece but I I think can't

02:43:53.160 --> 02:43:56.440
we all just get along there's room there's room in retro gaming love for

02:43:56.440 --> 02:44:02.800
ps2 and Dreamcast and plenty of it no take care of me guy have a good one take

02:44:02.800 --> 02:44:07.380
care later eight seven seven game olr is the name to call or is the number to

02:44:07.380 --> 02:44:09.680
call but our phones are lighting up there's like back-to-back calls hi you're

02:44:09.680 --> 02:44:13.120
on orange launch radio who's this hey this is Brad from pod culture well hello

02:44:13.120 --> 02:44:19.200
Brad from cop pod culture what's up mine Oh Loki you are far more laid-back than

02:44:19.200 --> 02:44:23.080
I ever would be I know just based on your Twitter and some of the problems

02:44:23.080 --> 02:44:26.360
you I won't get into it cuz on your Twitter so the reason I don't get you've

02:44:26.360 --> 02:44:31.080
been having with a certain realty company you've been dealing with I I you

02:44:31.080 --> 02:44:34.600
do not strike me as the type that would be as passive as Loki but I'm redheaded

02:44:34.600 --> 02:44:38.120
I got the temperament to go with it that's all right that's all right well

02:44:38.120 --> 02:44:41.120
there's just not much I can do with what the information I have and stuff it's

02:44:41.120 --> 02:44:45.520
not like I can go the guy's house and demand you know justice I don't know I

02:44:45.520 --> 02:44:48.000
don't know where the hell he lives and I don't know what the hell's name is I

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:51.720
mean cuz he's used like a couple different names and so you know at this

02:44:51.720 --> 02:44:57.320
point lesson learned you know that's all you have to do you have to use this as

02:44:57.320 --> 02:45:00.520
an opportunity not that we should be encouraging people to mod their consoles

02:45:00.520 --> 02:45:04.840
anyway but you had a legitimate I mean I think it's legitimate to want to mod

02:45:04.840 --> 02:45:08.520
your 360 to play Japanese games every week on this show I talk about Japanese

02:45:08.520 --> 02:45:11.340
release dates and even just tonight I said oh here's the game on the 360 looks

02:45:11.340 --> 02:45:15.280
interesting it'll never come out over here so people have a legitimate reason

02:45:15.280 --> 02:45:20.120
to want to mod their 360 to play Japanese games but let Loki's pain be a

02:45:20.120 --> 02:45:25.040
lesson to the rest of you be careful and if somebody smart use common sense and

02:45:25.040 --> 02:45:30.560
oh I didn't use this don't trust a dude you met on Craigslist with your console

02:45:30.560 --> 02:45:35.040
ever do not walk away don't get talking to it just say no I'll just hang out

02:45:35.040 --> 02:45:38.080
here well I can I watch you do it or whatever or you know I'll just I'll just

02:45:38.080 --> 02:45:43.000
kind of just you know sit here and watch you from my car be just upfront honest

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:46.880
be like listen dude I don't I just met you I don't fucking trust you so you

02:45:46.880 --> 02:45:50.320
know I'm going with the console you know you either gonna you know do this real

02:45:50.320 --> 02:45:54.960
quick and the other thing too I mean it's like seriously if it's going to

02:45:54.960 --> 02:45:57.800
take four hours I want to be there fucking going hey listen are you done

02:45:57.800 --> 02:46:01.480
are you done are you done are you done you know or like you know if it's taking

02:46:01.480 --> 02:46:05.060
too damn long list and I'll just finish the rest of home you know because that

02:46:05.060 --> 02:46:10.020
it's just it's absolutely ridiculous I have to wait for four hours and it's

02:46:10.020 --> 02:46:14.680
Just that was the part that pissed me off is the fact that he drug it out for four fucking hours

02:46:14.680 --> 02:46:19.100
If you're gonna steal the thing just say you just don't reply back or just reply back to the text

02:46:19.100 --> 02:46:21.100
You know sucker and then that's it

02:46:21.700 --> 02:46:25.060
He's like seriously. What are you gonna? Do it's like you know I can't track you down

02:46:25.060 --> 02:46:30.500
I don't know the fuck you live so you know I wish I did follow him cuz then I'd know where the fuck you lived

02:46:30.500 --> 02:46:35.220
I would be going right straight to his apartment or probably just wouldn't have gotten anything me

02:46:35.220 --> 02:46:40.240
Oh, just or one of the listeners will have gone straight to his apartment by now, but unfortunately probably there you go

02:46:40.540 --> 02:46:46.540
Well, I did you have any do you have any any further advice? I guess maybe for Loki don't use crack

02:46:46.540 --> 02:46:48.500
I don't know I

02:46:48.500 --> 02:46:50.500
Well, you know trust no one

02:46:51.820 --> 02:46:55.820
Pretty much if I tore or if you're gonna go use someone on Craigslist or whatever like that

02:46:55.820 --> 02:47:01.140
Just like be really crazy about it, and they'll fingerprint the guy you know or you know

02:47:01.140 --> 02:47:06.660
Or if you if he takes your 360 take their driver's license or something

02:47:07.540 --> 02:47:11.840
That could be fake too. Well most people. I don't think would expect that you know it's true

02:47:12.460 --> 02:47:14.940
Yeah, the one time I had a console chipped

02:47:14.940 --> 02:47:20.020
It was somebody who knew somebody and that was back in the day when my PlayStation 1 oh

02:47:21.220 --> 02:47:27.100
Man the PlayStation 1 was so easy to mod though you had a dark Sakura bought me a plug

02:47:27.100 --> 02:47:31.780
It's like a present for I don't know something that I just plugged into the back of the thing you did

02:47:31.780 --> 02:47:33.620
I don't know if you remember

02:47:33.620 --> 02:47:36.460
Mix I got mine chip just to play two games

02:47:38.380 --> 02:47:41.060
You did that's how we play remember the one day in my apartment

02:47:41.060 --> 02:47:44.580
We all came all the sacramentals came over to play DDR third mix

02:47:44.660 --> 02:47:48.380
That's when I discovered my love for erotic and oh Nick, please not so quick. Yeah

02:47:49.020 --> 02:47:51.620
The thing that I the IO port thing

02:47:51.620 --> 02:47:57.420
Mm-hmm yeah, yeah, there's like a little plug in the back you gave me one the game because I think you know

02:47:57.420 --> 02:48:01.900
I don't have the skills disorder, so I had someone do I also have another our form looking to get rid of

02:48:02.660 --> 02:48:06.360
We use those for a while, but like for the longest time Dan

02:48:06.360 --> 02:48:08.360
And I didn't need them because we could still

02:48:08.740 --> 02:48:11.360
disk swap on our PlayStation

02:48:12.180 --> 02:48:14.180
The single swap oh

02:48:14.300 --> 02:48:17.660
Yeah, there was like a trick you could do for it the first one

02:48:17.660 --> 02:48:23.920
It was just the single stop and swap it would load the um the PlayStation screen, and then you stop the spinner by

02:48:24.580 --> 02:48:27.940
Pressing the little button to the thing yeah, and then you move it out

02:48:27.940 --> 02:48:33.980
We used a paperclip to do it crazy crazy stuff all right well Brad anything else in your mind tonight

02:48:33.980 --> 02:48:41.300
You want to talk about well with the you know games are expensive and stuff, and I've got the studio and turmoil here

02:48:41.300 --> 02:48:43.300
Cuz we're packing up to move

02:48:43.300 --> 02:48:48.780
but to save a few bucks and some something that not everyone might think about is

02:48:49.660 --> 02:48:52.300
I've been buying a lot of games used from game fly

02:48:53.380 --> 02:48:57.020
Chief I just picked up like brutal legend Batman Arkham Asylum and

02:48:58.300 --> 02:49:02.280
Ghostbusters for like less than a price of one game new they've been sending me

02:49:02.280 --> 02:49:04.080
I've actually been using game fly now

02:49:04.080 --> 02:49:07.580
I have this really bad habit of hanging on to one game for like six months

02:49:07.580 --> 02:49:09.980
But yeah, they send me emails all the time about hey

02:49:09.980 --> 02:49:12.140
Do you just want to buy the game you've had for like four months?

02:49:12.140 --> 02:49:13.500
you

02:49:13.500 --> 02:49:17.940
Know and it's it's not a bad idea, and I think they give you like a little bit of money

02:49:17.940 --> 02:49:19.580
I mean, it's like five bucks ten bucks

02:49:19.580 --> 02:49:23.140
It's not very significant, but it's enough to try and hook you the little fish bait

02:49:23.140 --> 02:49:25.940
You know I don't know if I hook you you know they're there

02:49:25.940 --> 02:49:28.960
They're at the top of their game for the service. They're providing

02:49:28.960 --> 02:49:32.460
It's not a service for ever for everybody, but it's a it's a good service

02:49:33.100 --> 02:49:39.020
So I don't use it that often just like I'm kind of broke right now, but yeah use games nothing wrong with that

02:49:39.020 --> 02:49:44.140
There's so many games that came out like a year ago that I didn't have time to play that there's

02:49:44.820 --> 02:49:49.780
There's 20 bucks a pop now for real for real so good advice to the

02:49:51.220 --> 02:49:54.380
Gamer in this economy I suppose all right well Brad

02:49:54.380 --> 02:49:56.180
We got to let you go because our phone lines have been on fire

02:49:56.180 --> 02:49:58.740
And I want to get at least one more call hey later guys later, buddy

02:49:59.260 --> 02:50:05.180
Alright again, please don't be butthurt if you don't get through our phone call or of course now

02:50:05.180 --> 02:50:09.700
It's not lit up, but probably cuz everyone still hears Brad on the phone. I wanted to tell you Rob

02:50:09.700 --> 02:50:14.920
Yeah, I actually went on to the iTunes store cuz really I wanted to buy Final Fantasy 2

02:50:15.980 --> 02:50:21.860
And I found reviews for Street Fighter 4. Oh, yes, I come out during GDC. I heard yeah, yeah

02:50:22.020 --> 02:50:26.220
I'm probably gonna pick it up after payday. I'm just given that out of

02:50:27.380 --> 02:50:29.380
567 reviews

02:50:29.700 --> 02:50:32.500
It's it's currently sitting at

02:50:32.500 --> 02:50:34.740
Let me see okay out of

02:50:35.420 --> 02:50:37.420
894 ratings it's got

02:50:37.940 --> 02:50:42.900
668 five-star, so it's currently at a four and a half star. That's not bad

02:50:42.900 --> 02:50:47.820
And yeah, I couldn't believe though that controls are any good, but we got another call

02:50:47.820 --> 02:50:50.900
So I'm gonna go to the phones hi you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

02:50:52.300 --> 02:50:59.820
CT hey I haven't heard from you in a long time. How are you DT? I know good good good. What's that shirt by the way?

02:51:00.580 --> 02:51:02.260
What's that?

02:51:02.260 --> 02:51:04.460
It's not a shirt from our first tournament

02:51:05.100 --> 02:51:12.220
Way the hell back. Oh my god. That's like finding your class of 96 shirt in a truck somewhere

02:51:12.700 --> 02:51:15.980
That's awesome. Yes the what would the first tournament was scat right?

02:51:19.140 --> 02:51:22.220
Cosplay and tournament for those that don't know okay again

02:51:22.220 --> 02:51:26.940
Let me just let me quickly give the backstory for those that have listened to olr a very long time

02:51:26.940 --> 02:51:32.340
This show was formed because Loki myself and dark Sakura and DT

02:51:32.340 --> 02:51:36.380
You're a part of this circle too would meet up at the arcade and play DDR games

02:51:36.380 --> 02:51:41.000
And that's how we all kind of met and of course our show started about music-based video games because of that

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:46.100
But when the memani series started kind of tapering off, you know we branched out to saying you know well hell

02:51:46.100 --> 02:51:49.060
We play all video games. We don't just play DDR. Let's talk about all video games

02:51:49.060 --> 02:51:51.060
So that's that's where we've been at for a few years

02:51:51.060 --> 02:51:57.780
um, but as part of this DDR tournament throwing or as part of this DDR loving circle

02:51:57.780 --> 02:52:00.940
We used to throw tournaments and the first one we had was scat

02:52:01.620 --> 02:52:03.620
sacramentals because we're from Sacramento, California

02:52:03.900 --> 02:52:07.680
Cosplay and tournament and we actually encouraged people to dress up although

02:52:07.680 --> 02:52:10.740
I think we had like maybe four people all day that actually came dressed up serious

02:52:10.740 --> 02:52:13.780
and then we had a DDR tournament which actually for its time a

02:52:14.140 --> 02:52:17.960
Lot of people like Sacramento we had a ton of people show up

02:52:17.960 --> 02:52:23.280
Sacramento was kind of the place you went cuz you just don't give a fuck like I think a lot of people didn't take our

02:52:23.280 --> 02:52:28.480
Tournament that seriously, and it was okay like people had fun with it, and you know me you know dark sire

02:52:28.480 --> 02:52:33.120
You know Loki we're all about just having fun like I think Loki if I remember right Oh Loki

02:52:33.120 --> 02:52:36.860
I'm gonna embarrass Loki Loki had a dynamite rave routine ready to go

02:52:36.860 --> 02:52:41.480
And it was it's not really I just I had at one point memorized dynamite rave backwards

02:52:41.480 --> 02:52:46.120
And he was dressed up like one of the guys from the matrix because it was that many years ago

02:52:46.120 --> 02:52:48.320
It was because I had a trench coat on and well

02:52:48.320 --> 02:52:53.900
That's what you look like and he started to dance and I have and I forgot with the but he laughed

02:52:54.680 --> 02:52:56.680
He didn't go in the corner and cry

02:52:56.680 --> 02:53:01.840
He just he was he laughed and we all laughed at him, but no we all left with him alright

02:53:02.200 --> 02:53:05.160
And then we left at him. No. I'm just kidding, but now look

02:53:06.160 --> 02:53:10.760
Would we have ever had Loki on the show if it wasn't for dynamite rave and probably we would have but yeah

02:53:10.760 --> 02:53:17.540
All right, so I'm sorry DT. So you found this shirt. What else did you want to say? Well?

02:53:19.360 --> 02:53:21.360
Yeah

02:53:22.680 --> 02:53:28.760
Go ahead dark Tetsuya if you have anything else you want to ask us or talk about tonight the best of

02:53:31.400 --> 02:53:34.120
That the boys were on 3do mm-hmm

02:53:34.120 --> 02:53:40.040
Oh the best of yes is it are we are we about ready to roll do we have our best of put together yet?

02:53:40.040 --> 02:53:41.640
Or what's up?

02:53:41.640 --> 02:53:45.880
Well, I'm just waiting on this to finish up the narration

02:53:46.640 --> 02:53:48.640
yeah, I

02:53:49.480 --> 02:53:51.480
Heard we're gonna have a

02:53:51.840 --> 02:53:53.840
female MC in the in the

02:53:54.320 --> 02:53:56.980
guys of misty basically is gonna be doing the

02:53:57.800 --> 02:54:01.320
Narration for the best of and I'm sure there's gonna be a week in the near future

02:54:01.320 --> 02:54:04.720
We're not gonna be here in fact actually in two weeks

02:54:04.720 --> 02:54:10.840
I'm at PAX East so you may see the best of as soon as then because I don't know if I'll be here

02:54:10.840 --> 02:54:14.760
I mean, maybe dark soccer and Loki will still do the show without me, but I don't fly back till Monday

02:54:14.760 --> 02:54:16.880
So we may not be here. Maybe

02:54:18.280 --> 02:54:23.200
That'll be a fun show tune in it for that night when I'm not here and dark soccer is running the control board

02:54:23.200 --> 02:54:24.680
That's gonna be a high

02:54:24.680 --> 02:54:28.720
You're gonna have to totally show me the stuff that I'm missing by the way can't wait

02:54:28.720 --> 02:54:34.240
It's easy. This new this new system is so much easier than our old system. It's easy. So

02:54:34.920 --> 02:54:37.720
It'll be fun. Anything else on your mind our test for you tonight

02:54:38.920 --> 02:54:44.820
No, that's it. Just been playing a lot of yes. No to DX didn't you you beat a new song tonight, right?

02:54:45.720 --> 02:54:51.300
Yeah, I actually passed me. Well, I got this. I don't know if Loki's heard of it the ESR

02:54:52.120 --> 02:54:54.120
Memory card exploit. Okay?

02:54:54.920 --> 02:54:56.920
You can play copies on it

02:54:56.920 --> 02:55:01.680
Mm-hmm. Very cool. Yeah, IDG finally

02:55:02.360 --> 02:55:05.560
Congratulations, that's quite an accomplishment. So very cool. All right

02:55:06.120 --> 02:55:11.020
DT I'm gonna let you go. Have a good one, buddy. And thanks for calling. All right. Bye. Bye

02:55:12.640 --> 02:55:18.200
SSJ 100 Matt actually has a really good suggestion chat saying we should try to do a pre-recorded packed show

02:55:18.800 --> 02:55:23.320
Actually, what I think would be really funny is that maybe there won't be a live show next week

02:55:23.320 --> 02:55:29.760
but maybe there'll be some type of recorded show and like cuz I know I'm going to PAX with my buddy seg who

02:55:30.600 --> 02:55:36.600
Who he was part of the oom loud crew and my friend Amanda who's really funny and she's never been on the show cuz I think

02:55:36.600 --> 02:55:41.120
She works a lot Sunday nights, but she's you've met Amanda. Of course, Jamie, right, you know little little Amanda

02:55:41.120 --> 02:55:43.620
It's going to PAX. How random is that go?

02:55:44.600 --> 02:55:46.280
So we're all going I think it might be fun

02:55:46.280 --> 02:55:49.360
We might do like a recorded thing and then I know all our fans are gonna be there

02:55:49.360 --> 02:55:53.820
So I will tell you next week if I'm gonna have a hat or a shirt or something

02:55:54.040 --> 02:55:58.460
To look for me and I need to look at the schedule. I will pin can finish your scarf

02:55:58.920 --> 02:56:04.680
You should look for the rainbow scarf. Ah, too bad. You can't make me an orange scarf. I can make you an orange scarf

02:56:04.680 --> 02:56:06.680
Can you whip one up in like a week and a half?

02:56:07.360 --> 02:56:09.360
This is me. Do you make you a hat?

02:56:10.160 --> 02:56:13.440
Can you make one that says olr on it might be a little tough?

02:56:13.440 --> 02:56:18.080
Might be a little tough. I'm not that good yet. Why don't that make you just a big obnoxious orange scarf? Okay?

02:56:18.080 --> 02:56:24.280
A big obnoxious orange scarf. Excellent. I'll even put fuzzy fringe on it. Excellent. Make it fuzzy and very gay. Okay. Okay, excellent

02:56:24.280 --> 02:56:26.240
That means the rainbow one might have to wait a little bit

02:56:26.240 --> 02:56:30.200
It's for it's for a good cause by the way, the skype line is gonna be closed

02:56:30.200 --> 02:56:32.960
I'm sorry, don't be butthurt if you didn't get through. I'm very sorry

02:56:32.960 --> 02:56:37.320
Send us an email mailbag orangeonshorey.com quick write it down now what you were wanting to call in about

02:56:38.520 --> 02:56:40.880
yeah, big flamey orange scarf and

02:56:40.880 --> 02:56:45.240
I will find a game room like, you know, they do the game rooms at PAX

02:56:45.240 --> 02:56:48.720
I'm gonna look at what games are going on and especially if there's like a music based one

02:56:48.720 --> 02:56:52.000
I will make it a point to be there for like DDR

02:56:52.280 --> 02:56:56.760
Hour or you know as a throwback to how this show started

02:56:56.760 --> 02:57:00.560
I will make it a point to be there doing a music game thing and I know there's quite a few

02:57:00.880 --> 02:57:03.080
Olr listeners going so I hope to see you guys

02:57:03.400 --> 02:57:08.160
Yeah, and I like what act F to say make a pre-recorded pre-pack show and a best of the same week

02:57:08.160 --> 02:57:14.320
It'll be a little weird because um, you know, it's not Olr without Loki and dark Sakura

02:57:14.320 --> 02:57:18.000
So I would say it's a spin-off show for the week that might go to the feed

02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:21.560
It would actually be a show called Rob goes to PAX or something like that

02:57:21.560 --> 02:57:24.640
And then I don't know what dark soccer and Loki will do. It'll be funny

02:57:24.640 --> 02:57:27.800
I think you guys should just do something fucking random like next week

02:57:27.800 --> 02:57:31.140
Just get together and play a game or something and tape it. It'll be funny

02:57:32.120 --> 02:57:36.640
Anyway, we'll talk about that over the next couple weeks. If you have ideas email mailbag orangeonshorey.com

02:57:36.640 --> 02:57:41.920
Sj100 Matt says I should be using the Twitter when I'm at PAX so they can stalk me abs so fucking lutely

02:57:41.920 --> 02:57:48.640
I'm gonna be on the Twitter you prepare to have your Twitter's flooded with tweets from PAX. I will be doing that on the oil

02:57:48.640 --> 02:57:52.840
I'll be tasteful. Don't worry. It's Sony supposed to be at PAX because maybe we'll get to play the moves stuff

02:57:52.840 --> 02:57:58.360
I believe so. I don't know that the PAX is sold out dude, and I didn't go as media. I signed up

02:57:58.360 --> 02:58:04.720
It's just you know, cuz media packs is really nothing special and I'm purposefully going to be a gamer

02:58:04.720 --> 02:58:06.720
I am NOT going to be a

02:58:07.360 --> 02:58:10.240
Reporter I meant they just might have it to play, you know, like a little bit

02:58:10.240 --> 02:58:13.400
Well, they might they might but it might also be very crowded and hard to get in there to play

02:58:13.400 --> 02:58:15.400
You know what? I mean remember PAX Prime

02:58:15.520 --> 02:58:21.120
We weren't able to really play anything, but that one hour we were in early. That was still fun though. So we'll see

02:58:21.120 --> 02:58:23.580
Yeah, it was fun. It was very fun. All right

02:58:25.560 --> 02:58:30.220
Some folks in chat really like the idea of dark soccer and Loki doing a show without me. Well fine. I see how you are

02:58:30.220 --> 02:58:34.740
SSJ 100 Matt says have Dan here and have him take Skype calls the whole show

02:58:35.380 --> 02:58:39.920
This will be the ring you talk about orange on the radio. Hi. I don't care. Bye

02:58:41.140 --> 02:58:47.540
Shut the fuck up junkie. I like this. I like where this is going replace me with Dan on back tonight

02:58:47.540 --> 02:58:49.620
This is my Dan impersonation. Uh

02:58:50.900 --> 02:58:52.900
What?

02:58:52.900 --> 02:58:57.060
Shut up. I'm saying have a Loki Jamie and Dan show. I think that's actually really funny

02:58:57.060 --> 02:59:03.460
Yeah, replace the gay guy with Dan. That'll be hilarious. But um, actually, I don't know if I should say this now, but there is

02:59:04.180 --> 02:59:06.460
Talks going on for Dan to have a show

02:59:07.620 --> 02:59:10.700
Should I say that? I don't know. Maybe maybe too early too soon

02:59:15.020 --> 02:59:17.780
Yeah, we're thinking about doing something

02:59:20.340 --> 02:59:25.460
Vault related and I will say this much currently it is just an olr

02:59:25.460 --> 02:59:29.780
Project has nothing to do with all games if we can work it in with all games excellent

02:59:29.780 --> 02:59:35.480
But there's so many great shows in all games that weren't planned to do it just to say show that's not live. So we'll see

02:59:36.260 --> 02:59:39.600
More to come and that might not be the only new show coming soon

02:59:42.380 --> 02:59:44.380
All right anyhow

02:59:46.140 --> 02:59:47.980
All right

02:59:47.980 --> 02:59:52.400
So chatters like the idea of a Dan show you better see if Dan's gonna be available packs weekend

02:59:52.400 --> 02:59:57.160
Tell him the chatters demand it. All right, we're gonna wrap shit up. It's time for us to get out of here first

02:59:57.160 --> 03:00:01.080
Oh last-minute stories. I don't know if Loki cleared him out. So any other last-minute stories you guys have

03:00:02.360 --> 03:00:04.360
Kitty youtubes don't count us

03:00:08.400 --> 03:00:12.440
Some more to kind of go back to what we were talking about guitar freaks germania xg

03:00:12.880 --> 03:00:19.040
it's rumored that the extra song apparently is a remix of mechanical rock and

03:00:19.040 --> 03:00:23.560
I guess it's me making it go rock jive and

03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:28.880
That's kind of neat and then okay, so some other stuff

03:00:31.680 --> 03:00:36.720
Let's see, there's apparently a new guitar game or I guess a new guitar that's out there

03:00:37.240 --> 03:00:39.280
This is called the power gig guitar

03:00:39.280 --> 03:00:41.920
It is not only a guitar controller

03:00:41.920 --> 03:00:45.760
But it's a real guitar and you can apparently use it with rock band and whatnot

03:00:45.760 --> 03:00:48.880
And you can also plug it into an amp and actually play a real guitar

03:00:50.200 --> 03:00:53.400
No word on what the cost is on it though. Let me see here. I

03:00:54.280 --> 03:00:59.780
Haven't said what the cost is on it yet, but it looks neat. I guess if you want a guitar

03:01:01.120 --> 03:01:04.000
Although I just probably just buy a separate guitar. You know, that's just me

03:01:07.160 --> 03:01:13.400
Then also there's a little bit more tying in with the whole viral campaign that valve has been doing with portal

03:01:13.400 --> 03:01:15.880
apparently during their GDC

03:01:17.360 --> 03:01:20.860
Thing there was a blue screen of death that was created

03:01:21.380 --> 03:01:25.940
and that there was some error code or whatever and apparently if you

03:01:26.780 --> 03:01:30.760
Translate the error code. It says suspended until e3 or ee

03:01:31.260 --> 03:01:36.140
So obviously they're going down something portal twos at e3 da da and da

03:01:37.180 --> 03:01:38.660
exactly

03:01:38.660 --> 03:01:41.740
Also, Battlestar Galactica is apparently getting an MMO

03:01:41.740 --> 03:01:43.740
fracking awesome and

03:01:44.340 --> 03:01:48.540
It's interesting though. It says that it's being developed for sci-fi

03:01:48.540 --> 03:01:54.660
I guess by big point which they've done several titles in the genre, I guess before and

03:01:55.620 --> 03:01:57.620
I guess it'll be

03:01:58.220 --> 03:02:04.620
Coming out this autumn on the sci-fi s website for an exclusive 30-day period then I don't know where it's going from there. I

03:02:05.820 --> 03:02:09.580
Gotta say, you know since we've now finally done what we told the listeners

03:02:09.580 --> 03:02:11.940
We're gonna do for years and we did our fuck show last week

03:02:11.940 --> 03:02:15.480
We might have to do a frack show the week Battlestar Galactica comes out

03:02:16.420 --> 03:02:22.980
I'm just kidding awful. I'm kidding. We'll need we need a new epic show idea. I'm sure one will come up soon enough

03:02:26.740 --> 03:02:34.660
There's still the wheel of wheel of obscenity that I've wheel of obscenity turn turn turn show us the curse word that we should learn

03:02:34.660 --> 03:02:38.660
exactly

03:02:39.300 --> 03:02:41.780
Yeah, and that's pretty much it for now, all right

03:02:42.820 --> 03:02:46.340
That's it. We're gonna do a wrap it up and get on out of here for the night

03:02:46.340 --> 03:02:50.860
It's a good show though is fun. Lots of lots of ground covered tonight considering, you know

03:02:51.140 --> 03:02:53.700
This was the week that Final Fantasy 13 came out

03:02:53.700 --> 03:02:56.420
We did a very good job of talking about a lot of games and not just

03:02:56.540 --> 03:02:59.940
Not just that one tonight because we talked about it all last week amongst the f-words

03:03:00.420 --> 03:03:03.140
But anyhow, thank you guys very much for tuning in and listening

03:03:03.140 --> 03:03:08.060
We really appreciate you guys tuning in and supporting us and and the reviews like I said earlier and all that, you know

03:03:08.060 --> 03:03:11.740
Once again, I always say this we do this show for free because it's fun

03:03:11.740 --> 03:03:14.860
And it's it's like getting the family together to have a good time

03:03:15.180 --> 03:03:19.540
So if you like what you hear all we ask tell a couple people tell one tell two people

03:03:19.540 --> 03:03:23.540
You know about this show help us spread the word and if you're like Rob, I've told everybody

03:03:23.540 --> 03:03:30.480
I can't think of anyone else to tell then please post a review somewhere iTunes the zoom listing podcast alley wherever

03:03:30.480 --> 03:03:36.360
There's plenty of podcasting sites help us spread the word and there's even some folks have gone so far to do forum signatures and stuff

03:03:36.360 --> 03:03:40.960
That is like way more than we could ask for and really appreciate it. Just you know, so thank you very much

03:03:40.960 --> 03:03:47.000
Uh, let's go around and get everybody's final thought. I'll start with my final thought. My final thought is I want a taco again

03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:51.920
Yes, it's a Sunday night tradition taco taco taco dark soccer your final thought. I love my kitty

03:03:52.920 --> 03:03:57.080
Yes, there's shirmy youtubes now, huh? Yeah, there's shirmy has two youtubes up

03:03:57.080 --> 03:04:01.640
But I also was watching Maru the cat and that's cute, too

03:04:02.440 --> 03:04:04.720
Loki your final thought tonight two more weeks

03:04:04.720 --> 03:04:10.400
I get to play the rock star staff and grand theft auto 4 and I intend on kicking the crap out of them

03:04:10.400 --> 03:04:12.400
Can't wait. Are you gonna film it somehow?

03:04:12.760 --> 03:04:14.320
You gotta make that happen

03:04:14.320 --> 03:04:18.520
Make it happen. I could do that. I guess make it work. That would be sweet

03:04:18.520 --> 03:04:24.140
But the problem is because they're doing an event because they do these every now and then I always miss them

03:04:24.140 --> 03:04:26.140
But it's actually during my work time

03:04:26.140 --> 03:04:27.820
that

03:04:27.820 --> 03:04:32.300
Happens to take place and it's teams of two that you get to go play against them

03:04:33.300 --> 03:04:34.780
but

03:04:34.780 --> 03:04:40.920
I'm just gonna kick the crap out of them and it's gonna be hilarious. Can't wait. Can't wait. All right

03:04:40.920 --> 03:04:42.780
well, thank you guys very much and

03:04:42.780 --> 03:04:46.100
Tune in next week. We'll be back next week with more orange launch radio

03:04:46.100 --> 03:04:48.980

03:04:49.620 --> 03:04:54.140
We'll be back next week with more orange launch radio. Yes, Jamie. You'll be here. Just late. We all right
