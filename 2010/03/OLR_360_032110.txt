Sky, and Loki.
Tonight, March 21st, 2010, the Xbox 360 is set to get USB storage, GameStop tests perks for loyal customers, and what PlayStation 3 add-on is selling.
Hello, my friends, and welcome to episode number 360 of Orange Lounge Radio.
I'm having trouble speaking tonight.
This bodes well for tonight's show.
The video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, not here right now, but will be here a little later, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
She's at another commitment right now, but she'll be here about 7, 7.30-ish Pacific time, depending on when that is all over.
But never fear, I am joined by the one and only Techmaster Loki Hello How are you doing tonight, Loki?
Doing fine Good, at least he has chicken Once again, I noticed he stopped by KFC tonight Yeah, I don't know, it sounded good again Alright, that's fine Also joining us tonight, we have a special guest He was here a couple weeks ago and he decided to come on back It is Salacious Pop, or Alan Hello How are you?
I'm good Yeah?
Yes, I'm going to try and talk a little bit more
You're going to try and talk more today.
Good, because you have to fill in for DarkSakura because she's out.
But remember, those mics, not very sensitive, so keep it.
Yeah, a little stage fright last time I was on.
That's all right.
Tonight you're going to be extra sassy.
Yeah, I hope so.
You're going to be our sassy gay friend on the show tonight.
A stupid bitch.
Have you seen those YouTubes?
Yes.
You didn't find them funny.
I'm not a fan.
Why not?
They're funny.
I don't know.
You're not a fan of the sassy gay friend?
Not their fan on Facebook?
Fine.
I think they're funny.
All right, forget it.
Anyhow, we tape live every week, of course, at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
It's 6 p.m.
Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
If you're listening to us live, pull up a chair and join us in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, where we have the first comment tonight from Blackwolf, of course, our good pal who does the show before us here at All Games.
saying in our chatroom, Sky broke into DarkSakura's house.
And X-Link follows that up with Loki picked the lock.
No, Dan is here, folks.
Dan the man let us in.
I didn't come until way later.
He's in the gaming vault right now, and I don't know what he's playing.
He was playing Otomedia's gorgeous...
I sold my Japanese 360 Oh, very cool, okay Yeah, I wondered why you brought a 360 to the show tonight And I thought it might be because this is episode number 360 And I was like, oh, are we going to take one apart live on air?
And I was like, well, that's going to be shitty radio You could do that It's not very exciting Yeah, especially when it's a radio show It's more exciting to hear you bitch about the guy that stole your 360 How's that going, by the way?
The cops ever do anything about that?
No, not yet Sorry to hear it Bastards
Alright, well we always start off the show with a little bit of how was your gaming week, so tonight we'll start with Loki, usually ladies first, but since there are no ladies, Loki will have to be our lady tonight.
I will not be your lady tonight.
That's okay.
Loki, how was your gaming week?
Very uneventful, actually, because I don't know what I was playing this week, but not a lot of new things, I guess.
More Grand Theft Auto, as usual.
Still not enough Grand Theft Auto, I think, because I find myself kind of in a flux as far as going up the leaderboards, just because other people are playing it more than I am, so I go up a lot, and then I come back down.
And I go up a lot, and come back down, because other people are playing it and getting ahead of me.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
This week though, I am looking forward to being able to hopefully play against some of the Rockstar employees because I know they're going to be doing their event on Tuesday during, I think it goes from 1 to 4 Eastern, I'm not positive, but I think that's the time frame.
4-7 Eastern Final Fantasy XIII
Weren't those character names from Final Fantasy 2 or something like that?
It's Palam and Poram, but the way they spell it in XIII is a little different.
But I kind of am convinced it is a nod a little bit to Final Fantasy 4.
Because I was like, hey, that's a name from something else.
And what is up with Cid being bad?
I mean, first off, Cid doesn't look like Cid.
OMG, spoilers!
There's supposed to be a six-month moratorium on spoilers, remember?
Yeah.
Well, everybody knows that Sid doesn't look like Sid because they had pictures out there already.
Fine.
I figured that out.
Fine.
And, you know, he may be evil, he may not be evil.
He still has an airship thing, some sort of ship.
But it's like emo Sid.
Wasn't Sid bad in 12?
I never played 12.
I can't remember.
I want to say I read, I didn't get far enough, honestly, but I want to say I read somewhere that he was bad in 12.
And I know Cid never looks like Cid, but come on, man.
I mean, it's a stretch right now.
Whatever.
And then, what else?
So, yeah, it's kind of moving along.
And, you know, I'm to the point now where I'm just running past a lot of the battles because I just don't want to fight them anymore and just keep going.
Thanks for watching!
Yeah, right.
Cheatless.
Then you're going to be like, oh, my arcade cabinet, or oh, Grand Theft Auto 4.
Speaking of cheating, though, that reminds me.
I played more Borderlands this week and finally loaded up the new expansion a little bit just because I'm trying to raise my level cap again.
And then we played a little bit of the zombie island of Dr. Ned, and that was kind of fun.
Robot Unicorn Attack
Was that inspired by OLR?
Yeah, kind of, yeah.
Lots of WoW, World of Warcraft, and oddly enough, a lot of Bejeweled and Peggle within World of Warcraft.
So, kind of meta.
Some Warcraft 3, actually, going back to 2002.
Kicking it old school in Warcraft 3.
Blizzard just updated a patch for Warcraft 3 to fix some exploits.
Why now?
It's so far out.
Why bother?
They're awesome and they support their games forever.
How long have the exploits been available?
Were the exploits just found a couple months ago or something?
I think they're just from the previous patch from a year ago.
I guess they're really obscure.
There's so much lore in World of Warcraft that I just launched three to play a few missions from that for nostalgia.
So that's about it.
That's it for your gaming week.
Liquid Parrot says, I remember taking down Sky's high score and bejeweled on Facebook by cheating.
Needless to say, it was frowned upon.
Yes, because cheating cheaters...
are rude, especially in multiplayer environments.
I don't really care that Loki cheats on Final Fantasy XIII.
If he wants to ruin the game for himself by doing that, fine.
Have fun.
I don't care.
I've turned it into a more casual game because now I don't have to waste my time.
You have managed to make it be nothing but cutscenes in Final Fantasy XIII.
It's all it is anyway.
You managed to take what little game there actually was out of Final Fantasy XIII.
You're like, Odin battle, ha!
Actually, the Odin battles or the battles against the summons are actually difficult still because you have to do combo damage to them, not necessarily damage damage to them.
So it's still as difficult as it would normally be.
Everything else, so right through it.
It's like, oh no, this monster's going to be really hard.
Tap.
Okay, that's done.
Thank God.
I don't want to have to sit here for 15 minutes.
All right.
And I'll see you next time.
I didn't, oddly enough, I didn't play Final Fantasy XIII at all this week.
I've just been distracted with, I don't know how many of you heard the call on Bobby's show tonight, but I have a lot going on in my personal life.
Like, I'm going to be changing my day job in the next couple weeks, which is big, and then, you know, I just moved recently.
So, and then, you know, Boston's coming up too, which honestly I haven't given as much thought to, but that is definitely on my mind.
So I haven't had as much gaming time until the weekend when Alan and I just played a crap load of stuff this weekend.
So sadly I haven't really been in Final Fantasy XIII.
And some folks in chat kind of arguing about the Odin battle.
I lost the first time and then once I did the Libra and Alan can vouch for this because he was there.
I did the Libra and read that he was weak to chain attacks and I was like, oh, just use a Ravage Ravage in your party.
Easy.
Well, they're all weak to chain attacks.
Keep in mind when you're trying to fill a stagger bar.
Ravagers increase that bar quickly.
Commandos maintain it.
So if you are trying to get, especially if you're in the part where you're fighting with the metal armadillos or whatever that takes forever to kill, remember that you can use a team of all ravagers.
You just need to paradigm shift over and get a commando in there once in a while to make sure the bar doesn't drop too fast.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Anyhow, I don't want to get too much into Final Fantasy XIII spoilers Because I know there's people that haven't even touched it yet But I'm trying very hard not to give story spoilers There's still that one little revelation I picked up on last week That I'm like, I really want to find out if that's for real What I'm thinking, or if I'm just making shit up in my head There's another little twist that you figure out later on I like how the way they kind of addressed it Because you're like, wait a second What's that person doing in that cutscene?
You know, that type of thing
Ionotropic in chat wants to know, how do you read the info after using Libra?
Hit the R1 button.
That's on PS3, I imagine.
It's the right shoulder button.
360, it's the trigger of the shoulder, yeah.
It's the shoulder button.
Okay, other stuff I've actually been playing this week.
Quite a bit, thanks to The Weeknd and Alan being here.
Okay, the one I know people in chat want me to talk about.
We had just a spur-of-the-moment, impromptu battle with Under Sedation Live last night in Perfect Dark.
So the Saturday night show on All Games, Under Station Live, Travis and Breslow, it was their off week because they're bi-weekly right now, or what is it?
No, bi-monthly is when you're every other week because they have Sakura Con on the horizon and John's really busy.
So they're only every other week right now.
So this was their off week.
So they were on Perfect Dark last night really late.
And I kept getting all these messages like, we signed on to play something else.
What were we playing last night on 360?
I don't remember.
We started to play something else.
Rock Band, I think.
Gagapack, Rockband
I played Duke Nukem.
I just never got around to playing Goldeneye because I didn't get a 64 until really late in the game and by that point I just kind of bought it from Mario Party and Pokemon Snap.
Don't judge me!
So somehow I never played Perfect Dart.
So...
But they were like, you gotta get it, you gotta get it.
And I played the demo earlier in the day before Alan showed up, and I was kind of like, okay, well, I don't know, I don't really get this.
I see how it's Nintendo 64, and it definitely looks like they put a lot of work into the overhaul of this, but I don't know, I just, I don't really get this, whatever.
But I'm like, it wasn't bad, it was just, you know, I think this would mean more if it held in my memories.
So...
Finally, he berates me with a message.
Travis sends me a text message going, you pussy, play Perfect Dark with us.
And then Misty's getting in on it.
Just everybody's just berating me.
So I'm like, fine!
I will fucking come play Perfect Dark with you and shoot you all in the face.
So, luckily enough, the Perfect Dark multiplayer is cool enough where both Alan and I could sign into our respective Xbox accounts on the same console and play the split screen, and we were in a match.
So in the match was Travis, John, Misty, myself, Alan, that Nick guy who I haven't talked to, but he was there.
Matt joined us for later matches.
And was that it?
It was like seven of us.
And
And so after Matt joins, he hooks up his soundboard and he's playing all these Duke Nukem sounds through my speaker like, oh yeah, and all these things.
I'm just like, god damn it.
Everybody's laughing so hard, partially because I think most of them were drunk.
I think John and Nick were drunk.
I don't know.
DarkSakura.com
Could you jump in Doom?
No.
No, you couldn't jump in Doom.
So, okay.
So I'm just like, okay, I have to approach Doom.
But you can, and I figured out you can walk in the ladders and go up ladders that way.
Like, I figured that out after a few minutes.
And it was cool because I got to, like, punch Jon in the face a couple times.
And it was fun.
It was fun.
And then there was this weird, like, clipping thing that happened where somehow I ended up below Alan, whose character was on top of me.
And I was punching him in the vagina repeatedly.
In his skirt, yeah.
Because I had no gun.
I had a skirt on.
So it was like I was just punching him in the skirt region.
And did I kill you?
I don't know.
I think finally you thought to look down and shoot me in the head.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I died.
It was sad.
But Perfect Dark was fun.
We had a blast playing that last night, actually.
It was $10 well spent.
So I understand why people are all excited.
Because it's a good multiplayer game.
Everybody was having fun.
I felt bad for Alan because I only have the one wireless headset.
So I had that on.
And even though I had the mode on where you can –
You can't hear shit through the speakers.
You can't.
Like, I think, Alan, could you hear anything at all coming through the speakers?
Yeah, well, them talking through the TV speakers along with the game effects?
Not really.
Like, you can kind of tell people are talking, but I had no idea what was going on.
And Matt's in chat right now going, although Rob used his boyfriend as a decoy several times.
Well, what we thought to do later on is we were like, is that you?
Yeah, is that you?
Okay, let's walk around together and try to find John.
And assault him that way.
But that didn't work out very well.
Well, I was running around unarmed just so that people could shoot me.
So I wasn't really playing for real, which is really sort of shitty of me.
Oh, sure, sure.
I had zero kills the last two matches.
You were letting us win, Alan, of course.
I was just running around being stupid.
I don't like first person shooters on consoles
I love you, such and such player!
I'm like, damn you.
I'm sorry, where were you?
You hate first-person shooters on consoles.
Yeah, so I can do it, but I'm more of a stickler for the mouse and keyboard.
So I was being stubborn.
That's right, because you're like a Half-Life geek.
That's something I have to remember.
Half-Life is like God to you, right?
Yes.
Okay, so all this other stuff is crap.
But have you ever played the Orange Box on 360, or is that like sacrilege to you?
I downloaded the demo for it, which is the beginning of Half-Life Episode 2 on the 360, just to, you know, played it for about a half hour, decided I didn't like the controls.
Okay, so you're one of those PC elitists.
That's fine.
Yeah, a little bit.
That's cool.
All right, so other gaming weeks.
So then we played Rock Band.
We finally got around to playing the Gaga songs in Rock Band.
And I'll say this because I said it to Bobby on his show because he was talking about how he bought the Eric Cartman poker face.
That poker face Cartman thing is the kind of thing that's, like, funny once.
I couldn't see myself playing that song over and over again because I liked the song.
It's funny once.
But if you have a lot of people that come to your house to play rock band, you throw the rock band parties, somebody inevitably is going to pull that song up at a party and go, I want to sing the Cartman Poker Face.
We played it once and we were like, ha ha, next.
Well, you can at least do a South Park medley at least now because you've got a couple songs.
And Timmy, right?
And then we squealed because we were able to play Bad Romance.
Let's see.
Then what else?
Today.
Okay, so today...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
so we put in Beautiful Katamari and I'm like okay let's do co-op mode and I was kind of surprised oh it's not split screen oh we're controlling the same Katamari so Alan and I are trying to play and we just keep rolling the Katamari in a giant circle like and there's nothing on the screen to tell you like so and so is tilting the wrong way it's just it was bad like there was nothing to do it just splits the twin stick controls between the two people
and it's, yeah, I wasn't feeling it at all.
No, it was terrible.
After like 30 seconds, Alan was like, turn it off, turn it off.
So he decided to do Versus because it's like, okay, I've seen a picture of a split screen on the back of the box.
I know this has to have like a two-player true mode in it.
Sure enough, Versus...
is split screen.
And when we were going to the stage select, we're like, oh, home.
I'm like, okay, cool.
It's going to be like, who can make the biggest Katamari?
This will be fun.
Okay, now this will be great.
No, the battle was roll up the most clothespins in one minute.
Go.
And it's like this generically square playing field with a bunch of clothespins.
And it was roll up as many as you can.
And he tried to crash into the other Katamari once in a while and make them lose clothespins.
And so we play that.
And I was like, this is not fun.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and I was like this is shit like I think I literally said after it was over and it's not just because Alan beat me but I was like this is shit and I threw my controller down it was shit it was not fun like a versus Katamari game should be so much better I don't know if they got it right on PS3 you know I even in the single player mode the PS3 is the better game than the 360 and that has nothing to do with the consoles themselves don't start the console wars with me it's just that for what you know beautiful Katamari came first and they made mistakes so maybe they fixed them with the PS3 one I don't know but the
PS3, Katamari Forever or whatever is superior to the 361 and I haven't even played the co-op reverses so after that was terrible we decided to go into arcade and we were just kind of looking through arcade games to play and I was like okay Alan what do you want to play like what don't you have yourself and he's like oh you have Double Dragon let's play that I'm like okay like I think I played this for like five seconds when I first downloaded it back when I would just download arcade games to download them like
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
That game does not stand to the test of time.
That game is terrible.
It's terrible.
I feel bad for all of the $5 bills that I extorted from my mother and grandmother.
This game's really hard at the arcade, little nine-year-old me playing a bad game.
It's awful.
It's one of those games I think we really see through rose-colored glasses or whatever they call it.
Like, remember better from our childhood.
And I don't know if it's just the 360 port or whatever, but there's freaking slowdown and flickering.
And the game is just fucking cheap.
Like, don't press down too much or you're going to fall off the edge.
And it's like this horrible collision detection in the game.
And then finally when we got to the end, we had to battle each other.
to see who got the big tittied girl and it was like the worst fight in the entire world that we did.
And finally I somehow won.
Even though Alan hit me with a baseball bat like 50 times, all I did was I had to pull his hair a few times and I won.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that the three punches does way more damage than the baseball bat because I hit you about eight times.
Yeah, so we played our way through Double Dragon and we were like, what the hell are we thinking as children?
This game was better, it was better on the NES, honestly.
I would rather play the NES version of Double Dragon than the 360 version.
The NES version was awesome.
Although now I'm worried, I'm like, I wonder if I'm just remembering that one more fondly than I deserve to.
No, it's just like Contra, like Contra on the arcade, I didn't really care for it, but on the NES it was cool.
VidPower in chat says, 50,000?
You scored 50,000 points on Double Dragon?
From the movie The Wizard.
Dude, if you can score like 50,000 points on Double Dragon, that actually is really impressive.
Like I have a lot of respect for a gamer that can do that now after seeing how fucking cheap that game is.
Like, I kid you not, the last boss will shoot you in the back with a gun and you will die instantly.
Insert quarter to continue.
Like, what the hell?
No wonder they removed that game from Xbox Live Marketplace.
It was bad.
So then I said to Alan, I was like, well, fuck it.
Let's just make it a bad game day.
and so that's when I reached for Fusion Frenzy 2 yes the game I spent $60 on when it first came out I decided to pop it in because I'm like Alan no you have to see how fucking terrible this game is so we played like what four which by the way if you've never played Fusion Frenzy 2
It's kind of like Xbox's answer to Mario Party, but with a more science fiction future theme.
So we flew to the planet Moisture to do some battle in some water.
No one should ever fly to the planet Moisture.
To do some battle in some water-themed stages.
And Alan, what were your thoughts on Fusion Frenzy 2?
It was emotional abuse, and I'm upset, and I need to call a shelter.
Gamer spouse abuse.
What was so bad about it?
Just, the host was in like his pink jumpsuit with the spiky hair and you could tell that it was sort of, you know, edgy, like designed by committee.
And it was really just sort of the showgirls of party games, but without any of the breasts or anything that makes showgirls great.
It was awful.
Dude, showgirls of party games would be awesome.
Wait, wait, Dan, Dan, Dan.
We got to get Dan on mic with that.
Can you hand Dan the mic real quick?
My Double Dragon score is 68,920.
Can I shake your hand, sir?
I want to shake your hand.
You are a gaming stud, sir, Dan.
Now, Dan.
I have to say, for the record, I'm listening to you guys talking here.
Your opinions about games are all crap.
The Arcade Contra is awesome.
I like Contra.
Double Dragon rules.
Wait, wait, wait.
When did I say shit about Contra?
I did.
Oh, you did.
Okay, well, fuck Loki.
All right.
Double Dragon rules.
Double Dragon sucks.
It has slowdown.
It has flicker.
It's cheap.
The weapons don't do shit.
It's all about the elbow punch.
But you are right.
There are no good Katamari games.
Except for the first one.
What other games?
I will say this.
To Double Dragon's credit, there are no other games where you get assaulted by transsexual bitches carrying whips.
Like, no other game do the trannies come out and force you to try to kick your ass.
Like, I can't think of any.
Streets of Rage 2.
Very good point, yes.
Turn off the... We gotta go to the arcade right now and play Yaris, right now.
And the minute you launch the game Yaris, for those that forgot, because it's been a few years, and I'm gonna bring back all your haunting memories of the past, the game starts with a Yaris, like, driving... No, no, there's, like, a little robot spider on the ground, and then it pans out, and a big Yaris drives in, and a robot claw comes out of the hood and, like, zaps the robot spider.
And I look over at Alan, and Alan just has this, like...
What?
Look on his face.
I thought it was like a Pixar intro, like a cute car animation.
Like, all right, this is the opening sequence of the game.
No, that is the game.
You're shooting little gas pump spiders.
Yeah.
So then I made Alan, I made him play a race.
I was like, no, you need to play a really bad game and see what this is like.
So I made him play a race.
And that's when he started going, this is rape.
This is emotional rape.
I don't like it.
This is bad.
And then, yeah.
So what did you think of yours?
I am very happy to hear that it was free.
and for promotional purposes only.
And then finally, once that was over, I redeemed myself with some Fatal Fury special.
And not only is it bad in the fact that the game is just horrible and of poor quality, it also is bad in the fact that it led the way to pirating Xbox Live Arcade games on modified consoles.
Thank you, Yaris Exploit.
So there is no good redeeming value about that game, other than the fact that it can make the bottoms of worst lists and stuff like that.
Yeah, I don't know what else to say about that.
I mean, it's kind of funny, though, because we also somehow forgot to mention we were playing Puzzle Fighter 2 over the weekend somehow, and that's a game by Backbone Entertainment did that game.
They also did Yaris, and you're kind of like, my how the mighty have fallen.
Yeah.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Anyhow, we'll let her talk about her gaming week when she gets here.
Housekeeping tonight.
First off, I want to give a big thank you to some of the people behind the scenes at OLR.
I mean, obviously, we have a lot of people behind the scenes that make things work.
Deekman and VXChaseXV who do the website.
But also, DarkTetsuya does a lot of work for kind of like writing on the website once in a while.
And I know ActDeft does some work with him as well.
And I know DarkTetsuya and Misty kind of got together for this side project that is the OLR Best Hits.
and it's the greatest hits, if you will, of our first 20 episodes.
And when I mean our first 20 episodes, I mean the first 20 episodes from 2002, back when we talked about nothing but DDR.
So it's done, it's up, and you can download it.
The only thing I want to warn you about, it was a totally different show back then.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Um, and we were running a modem friendly, dial-up friendly, 56k friendly radio stream.
So the audio quality was not that great.
So I just want to warn you, if you're going to go check it out, keep in mind the audio may hurt your ears a little bit because it was dial-up friendly.
But if you want to hear the kind of stuff we talked about a year ago, it's pretty cool.
So I really want to- A year ago?
I'm sorry, years ago.
Haha.
I want to thank DarkSakura for putting that together.
It's pretty funny.
All right.
You can find that at orangeloungeradio.com.
It's right there on the front page.
Other housekeeping tonight.
We do have a list list coming up in part B tonight because it is our 360th episode.
So we have a list list in tipping our hat to the Xbox 360 tonight.
So we'll get into that a little later on in the show in part B. But if you want to vote, you have to be in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
All right, let's get into some actual gaming news.
Because Alan and I have been talking about a lot of old games.
So let's get into some new games.
And oddly enough, some 360 news.
Yes, Loki?
Yes, this week we had some images leak out of a possible slimmed down 360.
And much like images leaked out before of a 360 with an HDMI port on it, I have to say this is probably going to happen too.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Also, they've combined the GPU and CPU into one chip, and it's got an actual, kind of a different cooling system now, just more like a traditional heatsink and fan.
Also, the memory card slot is missing, but once again, that kind of gets into something we'll be talking about probably a little bit later.
But it's interesting, and I have a feeling this is probably going to be out by the end of this year.
I will bet you anything.
Project Natal Do you think Natal is built into this thing?
No, I don't think it is.
I think it's going to be just an accessory.
I just think the system is going to be slimmed down kind of to appeal to more of the Wii crowd type thing.
Maybe they're going to drop the price on it or something.
Yeah.
Now what's the source of these pictures?
Because I want to try and figure out how true this is.
Because remember guys, this is a rumor.
So what's the source of these pictures?
The source, it's apparently from some Chinese tech forum.
Apparently it was...
I'm thinking that it's probably leaked from some sort of production line.
The same type of forum leaked out some other revisions of... Yeah, I seem to remember the first PS3 Slim info was coming from an Asian web forum because that's what the factory...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
um you know stuff like that and different like power headers and what not um that are I mean this one looks like the CD-ROM or the DVD drive and then probably they're gonna have one that's gonna plug into the SATA drive um if it's gonna be internal so it's interesting okay so Loki on a scale of 1 to 10 1 being this is a fucking lie and 10 being this is fucking happening how true is this rumor?
I'd say it's probably 10 that's that's a pretty pretty big bet alright well it's okay
Where there's smoke, there's fire.
Yeah, I realize that we're only a few weeks away from April Fool's Day, but come on.
I mean, it just makes sense that they would do this.
And like I said, with the other news that's coming out, it makes sense why certain things are missing from this.
So, you know.
Spyro in our chatroom, chat.orange.com says, we already have normal 360s, we don't need slimmer ones.
Yeah, that's what the PS3 people said too, but now they have slim PS3s.
And it was the best move they made.
Well, they made the cost of the console cheaper.
Yeah.
You know, by consolidating some parts and taking some things that weren't really used very commonly out.
Like, what did they take out of the other PS3 model?
Was it USB?
They took out USB ports and stuff like that, but...
Yeah, it's just slimmer dies and parts get cheaper.
Well, and that's my other thought.
Part of why I think there is a lot of truth to this is that it makes sense that they're trying to consolidate some of the parts.
Because you're talking about a price reduction.
Because how awesome would it be if Microsoft gets the price low enough where they can launch a 360 console with Natal for $199,000?
That's what they charge for their low-end 360 now, right?
$199?
What if they could do that with Natal for $199?
That's a pretty big kick in the pants to Nintendo come this Christmas season.
Although, if that were to happen, it's not out of the question.
Nintendo might say, $99 a week.
It might not make a difference.
So I think right now at the point, I mean, $99 Wii would be kind of cool because then people would be like, oh yeah, I'm going to definitely pick up one of those.
But picking up a system doesn't mean you're going to buy the games for it.
I mean, look at all these people that bought just the Wii for Wii Sports.
And that's all they're playing.
And they're not buying Wii Sports Resort.
And they're not buying anything else.
They're just playing Wii Sports.
or, like me, I haven't played the Wii in months.
Neither have I. In fact, I was going to hook it up this week to play Rondo of Blood, which for some reason isn't on our show all night, but it finally got its release on Monday, which is exciting.
It's because Jamie's not here for Part A tonight, so that's how we missed it.
But Rondo of Blood came out, and I was like, oh, I should hook up the Wii and download it.
But then I was like, let's play terrible games on the 360 instead, for whatever reason.
So, I don't know.
Um...
Allen, I know you already own a 360, but do you think there's anything here that maybe somebody who already has a 360 might want to get one of these?
Do you think there's anything in here for us gamers that probably already have one?
Maybe to try it up so that hopefully the Red Ring of Death...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Out of curiosity, you brought up modding, and you've talked a lot about the different mods out there, like the JTAGs and so forth, the 360s.
Do you think part of this is to combat modding?
Maybe, because the JTAG stuff right now, they've already patched it out.
It's just, you have to have an old enough...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
those now they're figuring out how to mod as well but a lot of them aren't with an old enough dashboard to be able to do it
I'm sure they're going to find a way to do something.
At the very least, they're going to find ways to add a bigger hard drive if you want it.
But they may actually, if they're smart, go the route of Sony and allow you to upgrade your own hard drive.
Well, we'll see because I think we have another story coming up about further evidence that the Xbox 360 hard drives may be a thing of the past.
But first, I want to get into another story about the 360 since it is episode 360 of our show after all.
and talking about a patent.
Yes, that's right.
Thanks to the U.S.
Patent Office and people having to, you know, file those patents to protect their ideas, sometimes we get spoiled on things that may or may not actually end up happening.
Like, I think we've seen patents in the past.
Didn't Nintendo trademark, like, or, I mean, I guess there's a difference between trademark and patent, but, you know, for the purposes of rumor spoiling, it's very similar.
All those people to try and get to the ideas before them.
Well, anyhow, this, though, sounds very feasible to me, and this is a Microsoft patent that apparently was filed back in mid-2008.
What would happen is that with this interface that they're patenting, you would actually be able to download a game add-on from the Xbox Live Marketplace.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
It would be like, for example, I was playing Borderlands, and say my friend was playing, and he wanted to join my game, and he doesn't have the expansion that I have.
And I want to clarify, I'm sorry, but this is an important point of the trademark, is that the content that you buy is required...
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
and that's what you pay for a Microsoft system like it would be that easy I'm imagining other things like Game Room would kind of tie into this too I was trying to think of I was trying to come up with this I was trying to explain to Alan yesterday and I don't think my point really came across very well I was like I think Game Room is kind of like Rock Band I think Game Room kind of has a lot in common with Rock Band it's a system that's really going to make their bucks off of all these microtransactions
is where, obviously, they're not making any money off of the shell of the game.
And it's kind of like, well, yeah, you pay $40 up front for Rock Band, but you get all these default songs.
But for Game Room, you pay zero, you get nothing, but the whole thing's out of microtransactions.
It's actually like, a better comparison would be that Game Room is more like that PSP demo for Rock Band Unplugged.
Do you remember that?
They came with one song, and all the rest would play just DLC is all it would play.
it's almost kind of like that but for classic games so anyhow but that might be another one hey you go visit your friend's game room and they want to play you in a battle of I don't know what's a two player game Contra or something you know even though you've already bought that on Xbox Live some time ago well you could press X and you can buy Contra for 300 Microsoft points and go to town
So it's just making it easier to spend your imaginary money, essentially.
And you don't have to quit the lobby to do so.
That's another important thing, too, is that sometimes if you want to buy an expansion, you have to back out of the lobby, go back to the menu, do this.
No, it would be a lot faster this way.
I don't know.
Is this dangerous?
Is this something that maybe they shouldn't be implementing because it makes it almost too easy to download games?
Or what?
Or is this just a logical?
Yeah, this is more of a give me your money type of step.
I think it's just it makes sense.
It makes it more streamlined.
I mean, you don't have to do it, but I don't know.
It makes it easier.
I would worry that there's like 13-year-olds that are going to sit there and hit the button, but hopefully their parents know about parental controls and there's no credit cards on file.
iTunes and Amazon already have one-click purchasing, where you can just, with, you know, one-click buy TV, whatever.
So just to have that, for Xbox to have that in their marketplace, I mean, other online stores are already doing this, so...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
and what you do now is if you click you don't click on buy song but you click on the little drop down next to that and you click add to wish list and they say that the wish list replates the shopping cart but I think the way they did that was really shady like I hate the way that Apple handled that
Thanks for watching!
and if there was a song I liked that they played on the radio I would go into iTunes search for the artist right there add the song to my cart and like at the end of the week I'd download all the songs I have a new CD for my car like it was an awesome system but then when iTunes switched it up so now it's just click and you buy right away
I thought that kind of was shady.
Like, yeah, they have the wish list, but come on, Apple fans.
They made that harder to get to.
They made it harder to have a queue.
They made it easier to buy a game right away, which was kind of crappy in my opinion.
But that's a good point, Alan, is that this system already really exists in other places.
And there's no, even without Microsoft bucks on iTunes, it's real money.
USB Storage Support for the Xbox 360
And I just bought one of those memory cards not that long ago, although I don't think I bought the half a gig one.
Maybe I did, but it only cost me $20.
Whatever I bought was $20, and it came with Geometry Wars, which I tried to give to Alan, but you couldn't take it off the memory card.
which was stupid that is dumb but thankfully you will be able to use your USB memory cards to go ahead and save your games you can do download content, save games games in demand, title updates etc.
and um the thing is though you will only be able to use cards up to 16 gigabytes meaning you can't just plug in you know say a USB hard drive or something like that that's 120 gigs or those fucking terabyte drives now that what you just bought one of those not that long ago right how much does that set you back for the one terabyte USB drive
Yeah, about 110, 120, yeah.
It's disgusting how much data you can take with you on the go now.
So, I mean, at the very least, you can store, you know, say, you know, just without using a USB hub, you know, a good almost 60 gigs on there.
I mean, now, I'm assuming, I don't know if you can use, like, USB hubs on this, but maybe you could even plug in more drives if you really wanted to.
But...
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
You can play a movie or a music file off a USB stick.
Yeah, you can do that, but you can't store stuff from the 360.
You can't transfer saves or anything like that.
And that's what this is basically going to allow you to do.
However, this also once again plays into what we saw with the supposedly slim 360 motherboard.
There is no memory card slot.
There's just the front USB port, the back USB port, and that's it.
So it makes you think, okay, so they're just going to use USB storage if you want to do a memory card.
And I think that's a good idea.
Because, to be honest, the Microsoft storage is really, really overpriced.
And their hard drives are really overpriced.
So I do hope that they allow users to use their own hard drives.
DarkSakura,
10x the storage
Well, I think, you know, and I'm reading in our chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com, YYR says the limit will be two drives according to reports.
But even then, take two 16 gig drives, that's 32 gigs.
That's still quite a bit.
I mean, yeah, it's not as big as the 120 gigabyte, but that's enough for most of you guys.
Like, if you don't do video on the 360 and you don't install a lot of games, you're in good shape.
And honestly, I don't know how much good it would do to, well...
I take that back.
Do you think it would do a lot of good to install a game to a USB stick as opposed to just doing it on a regular hard drive?
I guess the difference would be unnoticeable.
But I keep thinking... I would think maybe the USB drive might be a little bit faster.
It's hard to say because the hard drives that are in there right now, they're just... I want to say they're 5,400 RPM.
They're really... I mean, they're standard for a laptop drive, but when you're talking about desktop drives, they're 7,200...
It's obviously a little slower.
And it's also flash, so there's really no moving parts.
So really, you'd be limited by the speed of USB 2.0, which would probably be, I would say, faster than that drive.
True story.
That's a dumb excuse.
I'm sorry.
If they're going to screw you for those hard drives, just use different hard drives.
Speaking of dumb excuses, let's go to another completely different type of story here.
This is a story that has to do with GameStop.
and also has to do with console shortages.
And apparently GameStop has commented on the recent Wii shortages and PlayStation 3 shortages.
And they're saying that those shortages do not look like they are coming to an end very soon.
There's a quote here from Tony Bartell, who is the executive VP of merchandising for GameStop, saying, quote, they could sell a lot more hardware than what we have on both the PS3 and the Wii platform.
They are saying it is not going to end until early summer is when this is projected to end.
and then by then they're going to have another console iteration and it's just going to be the same damn thing all over again just to clarify they say the Wii is supposed to get the resupply first and he thinks this is all because of the surge of the sales of the consoles from the last holiday season I've heard a different theory though and that has to do with and I don't was it you was telling me this Alan somebody was telling me this about the whole fiscal year that was you on a previous show
The fiscal year... Did you think the fiscal year is playing into this on both Nintendo and Sony?
I don't know.
They're just dicking around though right now is what I know.
Because first party anything from Sony is like damn hard to get right now.
So, who knows what the situation is.
And unfortunately, you know, the...
I just don't see why you would, you know, not.
Well, and how many freaking PS3s are being sold right now?
I mean, it just doesn't seem like it's as in demand right now.
Maybe for birthdays and stuff, but that's it.
A lot of them have to do with the fact that they're hard to find right now.
But I'm sorry, I mean...
How many years has it been out?
They're trying to purposely hold them back to create this sort of demand for the console.
That's pretty dumb.
People are seeing right through it now.
Just while Loki's been talking here, I pulled up BestBuy.com just to see because they let you do a store search to see what the inventory looks like.
They have a couple packages available.
There's a $299.99
Sony, PlayStation 3, it's the slim, so it's like the slim by itself.
It's the 120.
It is sold out online, and if you go into to do like a store search, it won't even let you.
It says store pickup, not available.
So that is gone.
Now there's a $349.99 console.
It's a 250 gig.
You can buy it online, but then there's this red thing that says not available for shipping.
So I guess you could maybe only do the in-store pickup.
Well, I did a search around the local zip code here, and the six closest stores in the Sacramento area, Citrus Heights, Arden Fair, Folsom, Roseville, Natomas, Elk Grove, all out.
Unavailable.
So, the shortage is real.
There's no disputing that.
But it's weird why that this is happening.
And, like I said, the theory, and it could be just someone talking, but the theory is that they're
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Final Fantasy XIII, although granted, the whole 360 thing, you know, if gamers want it, and they have a 360 already, they can just buy it there, and I know there's been a lot of back and forth about which version is better, but there's no difference, you guys.
The differences are minuscule, so just drop it.
I'm wondering on the audio, though, a question just to go on the Final Fantasy real quick, and this is totally random, but how's your audio sounding on that?
Do their voices sound kind of metallic, I guess, to you?
I mean...
No, but that could be your sound setup.
But I have surround sound headphones, and I've done everything to try to configure it so that the sound sounds okay, but it still sounds kind of metallic.
Seems okay to me.
Like it's heavily buffered or something.
Hmm.
God of War 3 God of War 3
to have your big game out and not have the systems to back it up especially if it's intentional if it really truly is an unintentional shortage then okay whatever just bad luck but if it's an intentional shortage that was dumb then they should have delayed God of War 3 saying you know quality issues or whatever they would have lied and said it was a quality thing or something
It's what they have coming out from first party for Sony in the next couple months.
Not much.
I mean, they have Mod Nation Racers, but that's in May.
And then after that, well, that's it.
So, Mod Nation Racers, which I don't think... Well, and then the move is later in the year.
But that's not until the holiday.
I mean...
I don't know.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thank you for watching!
It says, we believe that the loyalty program at Micromania drove some of the highest sales per store in Europe that we've seen.
So we think it's a very effective program and that's the base for what we added to our existing loyalty program here at The Edge.
So...
Micromania had the MegaCart program for many, many years.
It's probably the most successful video game loyalty program in existence.
If you look at Micromania, as we did early on, 86% of their transactions have a MicroCart ID associated with them.
Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
How theirs will be different.
Our program will be heavily built on heavily what you see at Micromania today but it will add some very significant pieces.
Our marketing team has done some extensive surveys like we saw linked online.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and many more.
I feel like when you're reading a story like this about GameStop and their programs I should be playing a song like this We can try that
Join us in our rewards program.
Alright, seriously though.
I mean, is there enough here to really get that customer list?
As if they needed to stomp out more of their competitors.
They're completely vague in that though, so that's the thing.
Unless I see a sheet that says what I'm getting exactly and what I have to pay into it to get, I'm not exactly sure if it's something I really want to participate in.
But hey, if it's like the end of the GameStop cards now where I pay $15 a year and I get discounts and whatnot, I mean, that's kind of cool, I guess.
And I get a magazine at least.
I can thumb through it once a month.
Frisbee in our chat room says...
I am your retailer.
and this has been done with quite a few Sony games if I'm not mistaken and probably some 360 ones too I can't think of right now but depending on where you pre-order it is the bonus you're going to get and the bonus has to do with the extra kart racers now if you decide to order from GameStop you will get Kratos from God of War which I'm sure is going to be a very popular one
We can also pre-order from Amazon, and you can get either Ratchet or Clank.
I don't know how that works, if you pick when you use the code or what happens.
Maybe you get both.
Maybe you do get both, I don't know.
And then Best Buy, you get Nathan Drake from Uncharted, which is actually pretty cool.
He looks like a me, honestly.
It looks like one of the Wii characters.
When you look at the little picture of Nathan Drake, honestly, it looks like a little me there, but that's what it is.
In my opinion...
I do love God of War, don't get me wrong, but I think the Uncharted guy is the coolest.
I think I would get it from Best Buy just to get Nathan Drake.
Now, I'm sure at some point they're all going to be microtransactions on the Sony marketplace anyway, but if you want to cut that corner, you can do the pre-order there.
By the way, also, you do get some type of mystery mod package when you pre-order the game.
You get pictures...
and you get other accessories to outfit your racer and uh yep you don't know exactly what stuff you're getting until you input the code it's like kind of one of those like mystery pins at Disneyland but that's what it is so could be interesting any interest in Mod Nation Racers you're gonna run out and get this game day one
I'm not sure, I have it on order, but I'm not sure if I'm going to pick it up right away.
It looks neat, but I just have a feeling it's not going to be as good as LittleBigPlanet.
And that's really, they're trying to get us to think that it's going to be LittleBigPlanet, you know, the kart racing game.
No, that's not what it's going to be, but it'll be pretty cool.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thanks for watching!
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I can't believe I forgot to mention that
Well, I have some codes.
Maybe I'll give those away later in the show.
I don't know.
Do any chatters want a blur beta code?
I'll give some away later if so.
We'll do that.
Why not?
SSJ100 Matt says the soundboard works great in blur because you know he has the soundboard with the Duke Nukem stuff and everything I don't know how he's doing it he's patching it through the 360 voice thing somehow and yeah he can play all these random things he's playing so if anyone in chat wants a blur beta code I'll give some away later maybe I'll give them away during list list because they sent me three others and I know at least I know Alan's gonna want one but I can give the other two away so I'll give those away to listeners why not
Oh, in the chat room saying, please, sure, yay.
Okay, I will give them away to random voters in our listless event later tonight, so stay tuned.
Stay tuned.
Okay, meanwhile...
Let's get into some, what, release dates?
Are we ready for release dates?
Alright, let's do release dates.
Alright, this week there's some decent stuff coming out, but let's start with some stuff that's not quite what you may be looking for, but hey, you've got people that you know that are kids and stuff, right?
Zuzu Pets, yes, the crazy thing that they were selling during the holiday that went like crazy.
Little pet hamsters now coming to Activision, or coming from Activision to the Nintendo DS.
In fact, you can actually snag one with a little baby hamster that
Blue and Yellow, that's one sick hamster.
How to Train Your Dragon, coming out, tying in with the new movie.
And that's going to be on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and I believe PSP.
Bakugan Battle Trainer, the sequel to the marble battling game, or I don't know.
that's going to be coming out to DS MotoGP 0910 I guess they're kind of combining years because they didn't have one come out last year that'll be coming out on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 Just Cause 2 coming out on PC, Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 this week looks like a pretty fun game
Red Steel 2 guaranteed to be better than the first one coming out on the Wii does require Wii Motion Plus so you can also pick up the Wii Motion Plus bundle for an extra $10 and save you like $9 off the cost of Wii Motion Plus if you don't have it
My Pet Chimp, coming out to Nintendo DS from 505 Games.
505 Games, I may add, was also the company that put out that really crappy baby game that I put on my Twitter.
You know, they may be a good candidate to hit up for the President Cat.
Yes, I retweeted that.
What the hell was that?
It's an actual baby doll thing or something, right?
That's the special edition.
Yes, you can buy it with a... It's basically a... It comes with a holster for your Wii that you attach to any baby doll.
But this one does come with a baby doll.
It looks like an umbilical cord.
And you play these little mini games like feeding the baby and whatnot.
It's just funny though because the baby doll that comes with the little special edition has like a lazy eye.
So it looks funny.
What happens if you shake the baby?
Not that you should do that.
That's not funny.
I don't know.
I don't know if you read the actual page or whatever, but he was tasked with putting powder on the baby and they told him to stop, but he kept doing it anyways, covering the baby in powder.
That's funny.
I think if you tried to play WarioWare with the baby peripheral, that might be a lot of fun.
No, what you need to do, though, is you use the baby peripheral with other games.
That's what he's saying.
Play WarioWare with the baby peripheral.
Aim.
A button.
Or like Wii Sports, like baseball or something like that.
You're bad.
That would be awesome.
Now there's a YouTube.
Now we need to find the baby game just to do that for YouTube.
And G Ditz in our chat room makes the mandatory South Park reference.
South Park reference.
Sorry, I'm eating too.
Kick the baby.
Uh, Cabela's Monster Bunk, er, Monster Bunk, yes, it's a giant bunk bed, no, Monster Buck Hunter, cause it's a deer hunting game, comes with a gun, oh yeah, perfect for the redneck in ya.
Um, Rooms, the first building, coming out from, uh, Konami on the Wii and DS.
Shimogami Tensei, Strange Journey, coming out on DS as well Disney's Stitch Jam, kind of a music platformer game, coming out also on the DS Settler 7, Paths to a Kingdom, coming out on PC from Ubisoft, yes with really crappy DRM
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and let's see this is an accessory though but the Nyko wand they're going to be doing the action pack you remember the Nyko wands like the third party controller that actually you can kind of move the buttons on it so you can plug it into this gun attachment it actually has a physical button for the trigger instead of like you know a trigger that pushes the B button on the bottom of the gun
and then coming out a week from now, America's Test Kitchen, Let's Get Cooking.
Coming from Nintendo, let's be honest here folks, this is really just them repackaging that stupid learn to cook game that they put out a couple years ago.
It looks exactly the same.
I don't know.
And then the better game of the two, WarioWare DIY will be coming out on Sunday.
And to go with those, the Nintendo DSi XL in bronze and burgundy.
Perfect for your Pokemon adventures and your little Pokeball walking trainer.
They should really just call it like bronze and Ron Burgundy.
Oh, boy.
Oh, how did I... Oh, wait.
No, never mind.
That comes out next week.
Or the week after next.
What does?
Oh, free running.
That's kind of neat.
What is free running?
Like parkour.
Like Mirror's Edge.
Oh, okay.
That's kind of cool.
Except not as cool.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Another game coming out that does not look like a dating sim is Hokuto Musou comes out.
And this is a punch and kick type of game.
I don't know if they have this out in America.
I'm trying to think if there's a localized version of it.
I don't know.
For some reason, it looks very like Fist of the North Star-ish to me.
It's something Warriors.
Well, wait a second.
What is it?
Oh, yeah, it's the fifth North Star Dynasty Wars game.
Oh, yeah.
Gomi.
I actually identified that.
And let's see, what else is coming out on the PlayStation 3?
The God of War trilogy, as well as God of War 3, makes its way out to Japan as well.
So they get their versions not that long after we did.
And Hukotu Mosu also comes out over there.
Pachipada 15, Super Umi Monogatari in Okinawa 2
That is out on the PlayStation 3.
And on the Nintendo Wii, Silent Hill Shattered Memories gets its release in Japan.
So if you want to run and open doors and stuff, that is coming out on the Nintendo Wii.
It's also coming out on the PlayStation 2.
The Nintendo DS gets a bunch of a variety of different games this week, like some type of phonics game and a wrestling game, but nothing that really big that's worth talking about, to be honest.
But the Sony PSP gets...
Burst Error, Eve the First.
And I don't know what that game is.
That looks like a little... I guess... Oh, it's a sequel to a PC game from the mid-90s, Burst Error.
That's what this is.
And they've turned it into Chicks with Guns and Abnormally Large Boobies.
There you go.
Look at that screenshot right there.
Big, big boobies.
And also coming out on the Sony PSP, Prinny 2.
Toku Yugi, Akatsuki, NoPants, that's right, NoPants is in the title Daisaku NC, and I'm pretty sure that's I Wanna Be The King Part 2 Yes it is, Pretty 2 comes out this week Very nice Well joining us in studio just in time, say hello to DarkSakura, or you're muted, now you can roar What the heck you mute me for?
Well cause I didn't want the mic picking up sound when you weren't here I didn't want Shuri to jump up on your chair and go meh
Outro Music Outro Music
Oh, it was fantastic.
And I brought the metashevitz.
Alright.
It was like, we didn't tell anyone to bring the wine.
Bring the wine.
Okay.
Do you want to do UK release dates?
Yeah, I can.
Are you going to do UK release dates?
Because we're ready.
We're ready for you.
Look, I had everything up already.
You got here just in time for your first story.
How do you like that?
Look.
Because we didn't have you slated for anything earlier, but you got here just in time for your first story.
Did you want to talk about your gaming week real quick?
Um, Gaming Week?
I just assumed Star Trek Online and Peggle.
That's what I told the listeners.
Well, no, I didn't play Peggle at all, actually.
I did play Star Trek Online, and I was about to start Final Fantasy II, except, um, I think I got a phone call, because it was on my phone.
Oh.
I got it for iPhone.
Damn those phone calls interrupting your game.
I got it for iPhone.
And, um, and then Dan was playing Gauntlet.
Like, on the NES.
No, on the Genesis.
He was playing Genesis Gauntlet.
Awesome.
You missed it earlier in the show.
Alan and I played Double Dragon on the Xbox this week.
And we think it's like the most horrible arcade game in existence.
And one of those games just kind of sucks.
But Dan came in here and yelled at us.
Because he thinks Double Dragon's awesome.
He would.
Alright, UK release dates, DarkSakura, just in time.
What week is this?
The 21st through the 27th, huh?
Okay, on the 24th, Game Room, Xbox 360.
God, why do they keep changing the date?
BlazBlue, Calamity Trigger, Clash of the Titans, Echo Shift.
That's actually a cool name.
Infinite Space, Just Cause 2, Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver, whatever.
Well, you know, okay.
How different can they do a Pokemon game?
Because you have the walking trainer this time, but it's a Pokeball.
I had one of those.
I had one of those and that's all it was.
And it was yellow and it was in black and white.
But this one has Pokemans in it.
Mine had Pokemans in it.
That's right.
You grow your mudkips by walking around the block.
Mine had Pokeman in it.
It had Pikachu.
Where am I?
I would play the MMO though.
And there's Racket Sports Party.
I would play the Pokemon MMO and I would play Pokemon Snap 2 if they ever made it.
Would you play it in a box?
Would you play it with a fox?
I would play it on a train and I would play it in the rain.
Could you with a mouse?
Shut the fuck up and read the dates.
Resonance of Fate, Red Steel 2, Rugu Attack, Rugu Twisted Towers, Star Wars The Force Unleashed Ultimate Sith Edition, Die Siddler 7, Warriors Legends of Troy.
God, they're just putting everything right together.
I may as well do next week too.
Shoot, Grand Theft Auto 4 or whatever.
But again?
Or is that like a price reduction?
It's the Lost in the Damned thing.
Oh, gotcha.
By the way, our chat room jumping out here and screaming some corrections here.
Lama Juice, it's not new, it's gold and silver.
And Lama Juice says, the game is actually fun.
And DarkTetsuya says, your Pokemans, please show us them.
AlphaKineticGram says, gold kicked ass.
Gold kicked ass.
I thought Pearl was fun until I stopped going to the gym.
Spike McRu says, yeah, but gold and silver were the best, let's be honest.
No, no, no.
The pinnacle is Pokemon Snap.
There's this gal on my Twitter friends list and I don't know her real well.
I think she runs Gaming Angels, I want to say is the name of the site.
I hope I got that right.
And she made this tweet that I just found hilarious because I kind of could see myself.
She said something like, I'm in line right now waiting to get the new Pokemon game.
Yeah, I'm 33 years old.
What?
What?
And I'm like, oh, that must be awkward to be in the midnight launch line for Pokemon.
My Pokemans let you not show them to me.
But I gotta say, there's quite a few people I know that are playing the new Pokemon game.
I almost, almost want to get it.
But I'm afraid if I do, Alan will break up with me.
Like, he's like, no, I can't.
If you do, I'll disown you, Rob.
Alan, would you break up with me if I got the Pokemon game?
I have nothing against Pokemon.
Really?
Do you want to play Pokemon together?
We'll both get the game and then run around the block and evolve our Pokemon.
Rob, you're such a five-year-old girl.
I'm just kidding.
I'm not going to get it.
Oh, but Spyro and Chat, oh, and Ionotropic I should give credit to first, jump in and say Pokemon Pinball rules all.
Abso-fucking-lutely.
That was an amazing game.
A++.
I will sign off on that.
Still burning from the damn horseradish.
It's also really kind of hot in the studio right now.
You know, I've got this thing that I used to tie the curtains back with, Rob, so you can actually have airflow.
Hi.
By the way, I was going to ask you when you got here, were you able to do the orange scarf after all?
Or did that not finish?
No.
I've had no time.
No, I understand.
I understand.
I just want to, before I talk about PAX East and Part B, I want to make sure I have... I'll try to get this monstrosity finished.
Well, I leave on Tuesday night, so... I'm good.
Oh, alright.
I don't think I can get it done.
I'll ship it to you.
All right.
Anyhow, let's move on with some more crash, bang, boom.
There's chaos going on in the studio.
Let's get back to some gaming news.
We have a couple more stories than the classic game of the week, Loki.
Yeah.
So with Game Room coming out very soon, actually, it's interesting to find out that there's actually going to be some achievements tied in with Game Room.
I thought that they were just going to be tied in with actual games, but apparently it's Game Room.
There's going to be 1,000 achievement points to be had and 56 achievements altogether.
Apparently, you get points every three medals that you earn.
There's even some points, I guess, for spending time in the arcade, 36 hours total.
Interesting that they have that.
I don't know.
What do you think about achievements in Game Room?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
The game is Game Room, it's just the classic games are the songs.
They're the microtransaction.
It does seem like, though, if you actually read through the list of achievements, most of them are driven by the medals that you win from playing the classic games.
So you're still going to have to have a variety of classic games in order to get all the achievements.
But I think it's pretty cool that they allowed them to bump it up to 1,000.
I mean, you're looking at a full game.
Honestly, it's just kind of a different type of method of getting it out there.
Definitely, and like some of the achievements in there, they have achievements for themes, like place a theme in your arcade, they have one for placing five unique themes in your arcade, theme your entire arcade with unique themes, your mascots, props, visitors.
It seems like some of those are really easy achievements, unless you have to do something to earn those decorations.
Well, the decorations, the thing that worries me about the decorations is you have to buy those.
Well, didn't they say that some you would get for buying the game on release day?
Maybe.
But still it's buying something You know what I mean?
I do Am I buying achievement points?
In a way you are If you don't buy any games for Game Room You can't get those medal based achievements Well I take it back You could do it using the quarter method But you're going to have to spend money one way or the other I'll check it out It'll be interesting to see I don't know how much I'm really going to play of it though
I'm not going to lie, I'm super excited about Game Room.
I'm all about the classic games, but remember, I do have a couple rules.
My number one rule is, I will not buy a game that they've already released on Xbox Live Arcade.
So don't be looking for me in Scramble or Tempest, because I already have those games.
I'm not buying them in Game Room.
I don't care how pretty it is.
Anyhow, one more story for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week.
And this has to do with something I actually mentioned during the release dates a couple weeks ago.
Actually, I think it was last week.
On the PlayStation 3 this week, they released in Japan something called Torn.
Well, guess what?
Apparently, Famitsu is reporting that shops in Japan are selling out of this, the standalone version of the Torn DVR peripheral.
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
but think about how cool it would be if they would just release that freaking thing over here imagine if they released TiVo for your Playstation 3 would you buy it?
I would, absolutely I don't have DVR on Comcast because I don't think the DVR that Comcast offers is that great to be honest I like how TiVo will do the recommended shows and all that stuff too and the DVR on Comcast is kind of clunky for me
I have something that does that.
It's called the internet and downloading.
I know, I know.
I'm actually ready to cancel our cable and get a different internet provider because Dan sometimes watches TV but we hooked up a computer in the front room and watched Hulu.
I have a decent rate going on right now.
I have a special, but I seriously think when the six months is over, I'm going to just cancel the TV.
I don't ever watch it.
He watched Casino Royale today for a couple minutes while I was getting ready for the show tonight.
That's the most TV we've watched at all.
We do nothing but watch Hulu now.
I watch Drag Race online.
That's the only show I watch.
We'll watch a DVD or something, but really almost anything you can just find online and network.
What?
What's that, Mystique?
You gotta say that on the mic.
Everybody say hi to Mystique.
I haven't watched Transformy, but I have seen Untucked.
Link, were they Undo Plastic Surgery or something?
No, no, Untucked is like the behind the scenes at RuPaul's Drag Race and you can really see who is nice and who is naughty.
And did you know one of my favorite drag queens this season was Mystique?
I know, isn't it awesome?
I was a drag queen, I was so excited.
I was like, oh my god, my name is awesome because I'm a drag queen.
And a porn star.
Exactly, I have arrived.
How many people can say they have a name in common with a porn star and a drag queen?
And a car.
I'm changing my name to Pandora Box.
That's it.
That's what I'm going to have to do.
So, moving forward.
Bet you didn't know when you subscribed to this show on iTunes you'd be getting drag queen chat.
Everyone just wait until I put up the pictures of Rob and Frank here.
I'm telling you.
I'm telling you.
You do look good in a corset and lingerie.
Maybe they'll find out at PAX East But here's the thing Seriously, if they can do a Project Runway video game on the Wii Why can't they do a RuPaul's Drag Race video game on the Wii?
Why not?
That would be amazing Because you would have RuPaul on your TV going, you know And may the best woman win And don't F it up And don't beep it up Alright
Because I want my own drag queen, that's why I would like to collect drag queens for myself
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta primp them all.
Gotta primp them all.
Exactly, gotta catch them all.
Pokey Queen, alright.
No, no, instead of, what was it, Nito, can you be Nito Queen?
DarkSakura goes in the vault and...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Why, thank you.
This was a game, actually, in Japan.
It was called Berserk Millennium Falcon.
Which was based off of... Actually, you should hear...
No, but I've seen a nice bush.
But you should hear, the voice actor for Gutsu in this was Michael Bell.
Did a lot of Transformers, Voltron.
This is the English dub, which is kind of... Listen to this.
It's a Mandragora.
I love the American voice acting, though.
Because you know who they got to do Casca's voice was BJ Ward, who was Princess Allura on Voltron.
I was like, these are voices that I know from my youth.
So this game was like, that's so cool.
And also my favorite Japanese voice actor was Gatsu's voice in Japanese version.
Is this like a Silent Hill kind of game?
No.
Okay.
Let me get back to what I was telling you.
Berserk is a dark fantasy manga in Japan.
It's very graphic.
Very graphic.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So anyway, it's based off of a manga.
And it's set, for anyone who is a fan of Berserk, I've read a whole bunch of the manga.
It's set between volume 22 and 23 of the manga.
So it's set after the anime series.
The anime was, I think, a 26 episode series.
And the anime followed the first arc of the manga, which was the whole Takanodon thing.
Everybody in chat by the way is saying Dark is an understatement.
Dark is totally an understatement.
It's like...
It makes Tarantino movies look like Cartoon Network.
There's like this whole scene in the manga where they go into this cave and there is like an orgy of the thousands.
No, a graphic orgy of the thousands.
Cool, blood orgy.
Oh, and then when they get to the place where they're doing the Inquisition and we're talking about old school torture devices.
Pretty vicious.
Is it a Spanish Inquisition?
It makes the Spanish Inquisition look like a puppet show.
Misty's back there going, nobody expects a Spanish Inquisition!
What in the hell did... Where did my show go?
Has anyone seen it?
Is it under the chair?
That's because Misty walked into the room and she derails everything.
But this particular one was on the Dreamcast.
There's another one that came out on PS2, but I don't count it because, really, I like the Japanese one.
Well, the Dreamcast one.
I do have the Japanese version of this game.
And I got it just for the voice acting.
Because they got the same people from the anime.
Like, Hayashi Nobutoshi does Gatsu's voice, and same everybody.
Except for, of course, all the ones who died violently at the end of the series.
Shaoran in our chatroom says, Everyone dies, the world ends, and people burn in hell forever is a happy ending compared to Berserk.
Yeah, pretty much.
Okay, okay.
I'm going to give the background, and if you haven't seen the anime, spoiler, turn off your station for a little bit, or fast forward or whatever.
The whole thing starts off with Gatsu as a boy.
And he goes off and joins a mercenary group and he meets this chick named Casca who is the second in command under this guy named Griffith who is totally pretty and has this weird egg that he wears.
It has two eyes, a nose, and a mouth but all spread in different areas.
Anyway, stuff goes on.
Griffith turns out to be the next in line to be, well, an evil god.
And sacrifices the entire group in this big bloody feast.
Yay!
Blood Feast!
I'm not going to go into it, but as the manga starts continuing from there, Gatsu and Kasuka have a mark on them that means they're followed by demons because they were intended to be part of the sacrifice, but they escaped.
There are similarities between that and Final Fantasy XIII, I just want to say.
Oh no.
No.
There's nothing.
Nothing.
Which is a bummer because I wish Vanille was in the game Jamie's talking about.
That's the only bummer.
Can I finish?
Yes, you can finish.
So anyway, this is a side story, but from what I understand, it is considered part of the canon.
And so...
Gatsu, somewhere in the manga, this little elf starts following Gatsu around called Puck, who's really more like a weird little chubby fairy with blue hair.
What'd you call me?
A blue chubby fairy.
Anyway, the whole point is that Casca, from her ordeal, because she had a bad time,
Sounds like Vone.
So anyway, it's them getting all caught up in this one thing because the main bad guy, his wife, has the same problem that Casper does, but it's a long story.
I'm not getting onto it.
It's really a game worth playing.
It really is a game worth playing.
It's really fun.
So, of course, it ends gruesome, just like anything related to Berserk ends.
But it's just really, really a fun game.
Um...
And like I said, there was another version that came out on PlayStation 2.
There's also the soundtrack.
Now, what's really cool about this is... Let me hear the music for a second.
You can find one on there that's Forces 2.
Forces was the opening theme song to the anime and the guy who did the soundtrack for the anime and the opening theme and everything did all the music in the game.
And he did a special version of the opening song.
So he did a special version of the opening theme.
So it really, this is actually, I think, one of the best tie-ins because you don't really have to, I mean, if you've been keeping up with the series, you don't really have to guess about where it's gone, where the specific...
This is actually one of my favorite pieces of music ever.
What?
Everybody from the living room keeps coming in here to derail the show.
Dan is just waving chicken around.
Dan, tell everyone how awesome this game is.
He left.
He left.
He had chicken.
Butthead!
Berserk.
Chicken.
I'm disowning you.
PETA would tell you that what happens to chickens is something like this Berserk game.
Yeah.
But, at any rate, oh, here he is.
Next time you have a Chicken McNugget, just think of Berserk.
Jamie always gets mad at me because I go to the store, I buy lunch meat, and I don't buy what she likes.
Well, this time I want... What the fuck?
What the fuck?
Bitch, you are eating that chicken.
Or I'll give it to Eric.
Joker.
Yes!
Berserk.
We do a show here, it's about video games.
The one that was on Dreamcast?
That game was hard as nails.
It was, like, you get to Nosferatu Zod, and he's like, by the way, I know you thought you were good at 3D action games, but you suck.
And he'll kill you, and kill you, and kill you, and kill you, until you finally man up enough to beat him.
Then the rest of the game is fucking harder than hell.
Yes.
And the story's a little bit dark?
No, no, Berserk's all bright and airy.
It's very similar to the Unicorn game.
You know, it's a story of rape and insanity.
And that's just the backstory.
See, if they had called the game Rape and Insanity, it would have sold more.
But Berserk, everybody thinks that's a game with a bouncing happy face.
No, no, no.
In an electric maze.
It's spelled differently.
That's spelled with a Z. Oh, okay.
And it has evil auto.
Also, hard as nails.
Anything else?
Chicken.
Chicken.
Dan was actually right.
That's pretty much how the series ends.
I have a Laserdisc.
Now, I liked Berserk.
That's very cool.
You have your Mr. J. Anyway, Berserk was a series that I was so into.
I loved the anime.
Piss off!
I apologize to the listeners.
There's just insanity going on in the studio tonight.
It's like our show has the red ring of death tonight because it's the 360th episode.
So congratulations.
Dan, you broke the show tonight.
Five gamerscore.
Yeah, well I got your chicken right here.
Dan goes, no, it's in the fridge.
Anyway, yeah, when Dan says that the backstory for this game is rape and insanity, he means that literally.
Seriously, that's how the TV series ends.
That's why Costco's fucked up.
So it was a really, you know what, I have to say, I was surprised that the game came over here because the anime hadn't been out over here
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
And then I watched some of the anime and decided to get the Japanese version because I really love dude's voice.
Hayashi Nobutoshi is like my favorite voice actor ever.
For anyone who watched Fushigi Yugi, he did Toski's voice acting.
And Basara in Macross 7.
Not the singing, although he's got an amazing singing voice.
But that's examples.
Oh, and he also was... Who was the dude in Pokemon who had the Earth-based... Brock?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sano's voice was him.
Sanosuke in Rurouni Kitchen.
Anyway, I'm sorry.
I'm getting my voice actors mixed up.
Sorry.
But yeah.
I'm sorry.
I'm wired.
You gave me chocolate.
I'm wired.
No, that's okay.
This classic game of the Wii game has been going on for 20 minutes.
Is there anything else you want to say about the classic game?
Play the damn game.
Or she will talk more about it.
But I do warn you, if you have any kind of traumatic memories, never read the manga.
Okay.
DarkSakura.com
It doesn't count Sega.
It counts Dreamcast.
I have done a lot of Sega games.
Sega!
Can we do a break now?
I guess.
We're going to break stuff.
Chicken!
Help.
If you're in the Sacramento area, please send help.
We're located at Jamie's house, Studio DarkSakura.
The address is... No.
We're going to go to our break here, but don't go anywhere.
We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
Yes, there's more to come.
Part A was one hour and 45 minutes tonight.
Will we surpass that with Part B?
I don't know.

And the topic tonight, I will tell you now, the topic tonight so you can be thinking about it.

But first, we have some rapid-fire news.
Although I did want to say before we get into the news, sorry, I do want to mention PAX East is coming up this weekend.
And I am going to PAX East, and I do not believe there is an OLR next week because of it.
No, there's a NAPLR.
There will not be a live show next week.
However, I will be recording stuff, but it will only be posted to the Twitter and Facebook and our online communities.
It will not go to the podcast feed.
So you've got to stay tuned.
If you're a member of our social networks, be at Twitter.com slash OLR, Facebook, Orange Lounge Radio, or...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I want to plug his panel at PAX East and if you're going to PAX East I'm going to be here for sure it'll be at the Naga Theater Friday at 5pm it's the Organizing a Child's Play Fundraiser panel and my buddy Seg he helped put together Umlaut which happened in San Francisco you might remember we were talking about that earlier so he'll be at that panel so absolutely I have to go as well so I'll be there I'll also be around the show floor keep an eye on the Twitter twitter.com slash OLR and I'll let you know where I will be at okay
So come up and say hello if you happen to see me there.
I don't know what I'm wearing yet, though, but I'll post pictures or something on twitter.com slash OLR.
Okay, now we're ready for some news.
Loki, let's do some rapid, quick, quick news.
Yes, so let's start off with the release date for Crackdown 2, which is now being put into one of the most dead months of the year, July.
Yes, it'll be coming out July 6th, and boy, does it look awesome.
The game will be releasing in North America on July 6th with Asia, Australia, and New Zealand following on July 8th.
In Europe following on July 9th.
No word on exactly when Japan will be receiving the game or any of the Asian regions.
But yeah, it looks all sorts of awesome.
One thing that was supposed to not be coming out over here apparently is Batman Arkham Asylum the game of the year edition will indeed be coming out over in North America and will also feature 3D support as well.
Originally they announced that the 3D would be done in a way that wouldn't alter the colors however I see now in the picture that they have the kind of purple and green glasses so apparently it's just going to be the standard 3D stuff and
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and a voucher for some unidentified movie download as well as an exclusive in-game item for Peace Walker.
Could it possibly be Metal Gear or espionage related, the movie?
I'll just call it a hunch.
I don't know.
Just a guess.
I don't know.
They don't have a Metal Gear movie.
Well, you know, it could be an anime or something right now.
I guess there isn't one, is there?
I don't know.
It'll probably be something like James Bond.
It'll be Quantum of Solace or something.
You know, something close.
Maybe.
And that, of course, will be coming out for $200.
Yeah.
Final Fight Double Impact Magic Sword
Well, it is coming April 14th and 15th, depending on which store you want.
Xbox Live gets it on the 14th, and PlayStation Store gets it the same way.
I'm disappointed that Captain Commando is not part of that.
No, but it's weird, because it's Final Fight and Magic Sword.
I can't think of more different games.
They're running on the same engine.
I know, but they're still completely different games, Loki.
They have nothing in common.
Yes, it's the same engine.
Well, two games to the price of one.
That's the way I look at it.
That's fine.
That's fine.
So I'm looking forward to it.
If not for nothing else, for me, it's Magic Sword featuring Final Fight because I hate how Magic Sword is being understated in this release.
I don't know why.
It bugs me.
I'm just weird.
Would you like to buy my namesake?
That's right.
You can buy an R.O.B.
Robot.
The Rob the Robot you can buy for the Nintendo Entertainment System.
Except it will set you back only $4,150.
That's right.
It just sold on an eBay auction this week.
But here's the deal, guys.
It was like pristine in a case.
It looks like one of those sales cases that they actually used to have in the store.
I remember those.
Yeah, I remember those too.
So somebody actually bought that with the Nintendo System, the controllers, the gun, all that stuff.
$4,150.
I don't know if they remembered, but it wasn't that good.
I don't know if you ever actually played the Rob the Robot, but it was kind of annoying.
I wanted to get one for my desk, and trust me, they're a lot cheaper than $4,000.
I mean, you could get them way cheaper.
Well, yeah, these are in pristine condition.
Ah, who cares?
I gotta say, in the display box and everything's pretty cool, but it's weird to think that that was sitting in some store that probably got sent it for free.
But yeah...
If you've never played the Rob the Robot before, it was really weird.
It had these little gyro things that would spin, and then you would have to move them onto a thing that would push down the button on your controller, but then they would start to lose speed, so you'd have to pick them up and rev them up again.
It was kind of annoying.
Yeah, the NES that I got was, I think I got a NES when I was little within the first month of it coming out, so I got the ROB system.
It really wasn't fun at all, and it was loud.
It was so loud, the sound of it, you know, spinning up the things.
My friend had one of these, and I remember we tried to play it once, and it was a little ridiculous.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, not worth $41.50?
No.
Okay.
Alright, and one other story for you guys.
Pac-Man Battle Royale, we talked about it a couple weeks on the show, saying it had the worst teaser trailer ever because it didn't say anything about the game.
Now we finally know some things about the game.
A video has hit the internet from the Amusement Expo that finally shows a little bit about what we can see in this game.
And we see some folks playing the game in this video.
And basically it looks like a little bit of a mixture between Pac-Man Championship Edition, it kind of has those little graphics, and a little bit of Pac-Man Versus elements.
But here's the deal.
In Pac-Man Versus, the other players are playing as ghosts, but that's not what's happening here.
Everybody is playing as different Pac-Mans.
But Pac-Man can eat the other Pac-Mans with a specific power-up.
And here's the coolest part of all, it's a cocktail cabinet.
So it's a table.
That's the cabinet they're playing it on.
It's one of those old cocktail cabinets.
But you know what the lamest part about it is?
What?
Eating the dots doesn't give you any points.
There's no points in the game other than eating the other players or being the last one to survive.
I would imagine eating the dots is how you power up.
It's basically how you... Eating the dots is basically how you trigger more dots to appear and more power-ups to appear.
Did you grow like Super Pac-Man?
Yes, you do.
That is beautiful.
Pac-Man Pac-Man Pac-Man Pac-Man Pac-Man
If Pac-Man is his species, then Pac-Man would be proper.
Just checking.
Nope, don't care.
I'm just kidding.
Fine.
So yeah, bite me.
Okay, well...
For our friends in the UK and in Germany, and trust me, I tried.
Telltale is going to be giving out free copies of the Strong Bad... The Strong Bad's cool game for attractive people on Wii.
You're getting Episode 2, Strong Baddie of the Free, and that will be your prize.
But there's only about 300 copies, and this has already been going on.
So if you want to...
Do the survey.
It's at surveymonkey.com slash S slash, and this is all capitals, L-H-R-S-C-X-J.
But I'm going to post it in the chat room so that they can do it first.
Nice.
Because you get a special prize for listening to us live.
And Rob, do you want to post it on Twitter too?
Oh well.
Oh well.
And for Rock Band, who the heck cares about any of these people?
X-Pack, number one.
This is Rock Band download content.
There's Blue Spark, The Hungry Wolf, I Must Not Think Bad Thoughts, and Los Angeles.
I'd take Hungry Like the Wolf, but that's not this.
I'll take Kick Your Butt.
Individual tracks is Little Fish, Am I Crazy, Big Bang, and Darling Deer.
Ace Frehley, wasn't that the guitarist for Kiss?
Yeah, Ace Frehley was the guitarist for Kiss.
I didn't know he was doing stuff on his own anymore.
Outer Space, Carrie Underwood, All-American Girl, Snore, One Republic, Stop and Stare.
It's also, of course, available for Lego Rock Band.
Oh, Ryan Tedder.
and 32X Anniversary!
Yay!
There is the 32X Anniversary album Sega is going to be putting out that will have all of the tracks released.
from Space Harrier, Stellar Assault, Virtua Racing Deluxe, oh lord, Parasquad, Metalhead, and Virtua Fighter.
Exactly the way they were on the 32X.
And it will be released through Wave Master, Sega's label, on March 31st for 3,625 yen, about 40 bucks.
But you can just get 32X in all the games for a lot less than that.
I have a 32X.
The Great Space Mushroom.
Why is there no Calibri soundtrack on here?
I don't know.
Maybe it's like a hidden track.
Maybe it's a hidden track.
Why is there no Knuckles Chaotix on here?
I don't know.
That game was cool.
I don't know.
However, I do love Space Harrier on 32X because it is the arcade version.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thanks for watching!
Okay, but first some Twitter topics, and I was not a good host tonight and forgot to remind people to post their Twitter topics, but that's okay.
Like, I don't want the segment to be that long tonight because we have Listless tonight, and now we have an interview in Part B, so yeah, we got to hurry, hurry.
Alright, let's see, starting off with TigerClaw305, linking us to a story about how McDonald's uses the DS to train part-time workers.
It's a DS-based training.
Now, keep in mind, this isn't something that's happening in America, but it's something that's working with McDonald's Japan.
They actually use the DS as a training tool using a training program called eSmart.
So a part-time employee will train through the software.
It's going to be used in 3,700 stores all around Japan.
And the program's cost is about 200 million yen.
Not that somebody actually has to pay that, but that's how much it costs to develop and everything.
McDonald's thinks it can cut the training time by over half.
by using this new system because lots of people already know how to use the DS and they want to get employees quickly out on the floor.
Kind of interesting.
I got to admit, my day job, if you didn't know, has to do with training.
I train for a big corporation.
Not McDonald's, but a different corporation.
I'm always interested in these types of new training tools.
I guess if you can make sure that employees are comprehending the information given and it's a fun, interactive way to learn...
Blue Swim
Twitter question, did you guys take advantage of Kmart's $10 off $20 plus coupon overnight?
Apparently, there was an online coupon for its NYC stores that wasn't region locked, allowing people everywhere to use it.
No, I hadn't heard and it would be really hard to get me to set foot in a Kmart anyway.
I guess it came right around the corner.
But, you know, free money is a pretty good way to do it, I gotta say.
Oops.
We started to have mailbag music play in the background there.
We don't want that.
SSJ100Matt is linking us to a story about an Apple-related incident where Apple apparently banned a game developer because he called the store awful and horrible.
The developer's name was Tommy Refens and Apple removed his app Zits and Giggles.
Well, for starters, that just needed to be removed, but whatever.
Apparently, the creator was at Game Developers Conference, and he said that he absolutely fucking hates the iPhone App Store.
He said that the iPhone gaming market is like the Tiger handheld games of the 80s and 90s.
You might remember those crappy little LCD games like Mr. Game & Watch-esque stuff.
Um...
Also, zits and giggles, this was the guy, this was the company, and I think we've talked about him on the store.
They would keep raising the price of their game to see who would keep buying it.
And they had raised it up to over $400.
Apple, of course, didn't tell any reason why they took the game down.
So, there you go.
But maybe it had to be with the fact that he was acting like a dick.
And if you bite the hand that feeds you, they're probably going to cut you off.
Uh, Ionotropic asks, Puzzle Quest 2, discuss the puzzle crack.
Puzzle Quest 2 is not out yet, is it?
It's not out yet.
It's coming out.
Alan, I know you're a big Puzzle Quest fan, and you like the gyromancers and those types of games.
What do you want in a Puzzle Quest 2?
Is there anything you're looking for?
Um, just have it not be Galactrix, really.
It's not Galactrix this time.
No, they're going back to the old school puzzle quest.
It's more ye olde, uh, bejeweling.
Yeah.
So there you go.
You just want more of the same?
No features you can think of?
No.
Well, they have, like, Peggle Quests or something like that, you know?
Peggle Quest?
I think DarkSakura would be all over that.
Peggle Knights with a K?
Peggle Death.
All right.
And lastly, Actdeft links us to a story.
Australia is closer to getting M-rated games, says the tweet that came to us at OLR.
Linking us to this story about somebody, I guess, who is stepping down.
Michael Atkinson is the South Australian Attorney General, and apparently he's the reason why there is no R18-plus rating for games.
He's stepping down, and the thought is...
Maybe somebody will get in there that knows what they're talking about with this rating system.
So maybe we won't have so many stories about Australia gets such and such banned game or what have you in the future.
That would be exciting for them.
We'll hope, at least, anyway, for them.
All right, let's get back into some news.
Loki, what you got for us tonight?
Apparently Pikmin 3 is in development and Miyamoto has confirmed that.
I believe he confirmed it before though if you ask me, but whatever.
Apparently the official Nintendo magazine in the UK was saying that Miyamoto has confirmed that Pikmin 3 development is well underway.
Over a year ago it was rumored to be released apparently around this time, but it's not obviously.
and no word exactly what they're going to change about it.
Apparently, the thought is maybe they're going to announce something at E3.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thanks for watching!
Pikmin 3 is probably not going to be any different than Pikmin 2.
It'll just be on the Wii, and you'll buy it anyways because you're a sucker.
But I don't think this is going to have the same draw as, say, a Mario Galaxy or something like that.
And you know, not that this would be a horrible thing, I think it would be a very cheap thing to do, but I could see Nintendo doing another new Super Mario Bros.
game this soon.
You know what I mean?
It's very possible.
I went to the chat room and I asked in chat at chat.ornersloungeradio.com I said, chat, help me out.
What is the appeal of Pikmin?
And Gditz replied, is there any?
Actdeft replied, Pikmin is basically an RTS, but cute.
So that is apparently what it is.
It's an RTS, but cute.
So there you go.
And Toygak seems to think, if Pikmin 3 does not equal 2, then 3 does not equal 1.
Frisbee says, Pikmin was great 9 years ago.
LamaJu says, I like Pikmin 1.
I thought the game was really fun.
I don't know, it's just one of those games I never got around to playing.
Togak also chimes in and says, I fucking hate the new play controls.
Spike McCrew says, it's got calm music.
We need a new Star Fox or a new F-Zero.
That's what we need.
All right, well, I've got another story for you guys, and it has to do with the first lady, Michelle Obama.
Yes, video games and the White House, believe it or not.
And apparently it's because the government has kind of, in a way, endorsed Dance Dance Revolution.
Okay, let me explain how this works here.
Let's Move is a new program, and First Lady Michelle Obama was there for the kickoff, and she actually mentioned the game by name in her speech.
She said, and I have to say that many of you have been very creative on this piece already.
Folks in West Virginia have taken the lead in bringing DDR, that's Dance Dance Revolution, it's a new video game that gets kids up and moving.
Haha, new.
That game's been around since, what, 98?
many other states use it as well and let me tell you I can attest to Dance Dance Revolution we got it at Camp David and it'll make you sweat and it's addictive in a very good way the president still can't do it so anyhow that's cute I want to point out that Let's Move is not just about DDR though but it's more about getting you know kids and stuff up and moving so it's a good thing they didn't call the program Let Them Move though because that would have been a big groan from the DDR crowd
I love the fact though that it's a quote-unquote new video game.
Well, technically that's true.
They're making new video games in that series all the time.
It's just nowhere near new.
Alright, DarkSakura's got a story for us and then Listless is coming up.
Well, Steam is, of course, removing Assassin's Creed 2 and Silent Hunter 5, but it says it wasn't because of the DRM.
They're actually available in places other than Steam.
It's just specifically that Steam UK...
I wasn't wanting to deal with it.
They said that it has to do with local business discussion between Ubisoft and Steam in the UK.
But yeah, it's no longer available.
Well, I guess they didn't want to try to fix it.
Well, you know, I know Steam is denying it, and it's probably accurate because it sounds like this is isolated to overseas.
It's not really happening here.
This is UK specifically.
Yeah.
But I still go back to the point I was saying before when I was talking about how Ubisoft's DRM is not just going to get Ubisoft in trouble, that they're going to be calling places like...
Target and Walmart where people buy these games saying my game doesn't work and returning it and the retailer is going to get caught in the middle and the minute that starts happening they're going to stop carrying these games.
I just think it's ridiculous how people don't think any of this through.
Alright.
Well folks, it is that time and we haven't done this in a little while on the show but I'm very excited that tonight we are bringing back for 360th episode Listless!
Now there's a lot of people in our chat room that are kind of newer to the show and they don't know how this works.
So let me explain it for you guys.
What we're going to do is we're going to go around the room and we are going to create the definitive list about a certain topic.
And tonight's topic is the great idea that Microsoft should steal and make better next.
Sometimes our answers are serious, sometimes they're silly, sometimes they're completely nonsensical.
But like it or not, it is the list that we have come up with for the question.
Now, once all four of us, since we have our special guest Alan tonight, come up with our list, we'll have a list of 12.
Then the hard part comes.
We will each go around the room and remove one item from the list.
Usually it's someone else's item, but you can remove your own, I suppose, if you are feeling cannibalistic like that.
That will leave us with a list of eight questions.
Then our chat room will vote for their number one and number two favorite in a private message to me.
And then your top three answers, based on your votes, will come up with our definitive list.
Now keep in mind, you can send us a private message.
Now if you have an answer, if you want to help the hosts out, because sometimes we are thinking of topics right in the heat of the moment, Loki,
you can yell out your answers in chat right now and they might get included in the host list so again that is the great idea that Microsoft Microsoft Microsoft Microsoft Microsoft
I never met a carrot I didn't like, except for this one.
The great idea that Microsoft should steal next.
Alright, who wants to start us off tonight?
Loki, I'll call on you and see if you did your homework.
Loki, your number three answer for the great idea, because again, I want to remind you guys where this topic comes from.
Project Natal.
Stolen motion controller, basically.
Xbox Live, kind of taking some things from PC gaming and incorporating into their games.
You know, Xbox takes other people's ideas.
Not that there's anything wrong with that, because they make them better.
They take other people's ideas and make them better.
Alright.
So here we go.
What should they improve next?
And I guess it doesn't have to be gaming related, but it helps.
Alright, Loki, what is your... Oops, I gotta get my little whiteboard up here to keep track of our answers.
Loki, what is your number three answer for the idea that they should steal next?
The PSP.
The PSP, so making like a handheld system essentially, or just the PSP?
No, a handheld system.
They shouldn't exactly make it like the PSP, but like, you know, something that's a widescreen, you know, possibly high def, you know, handheld system, plays decent games, maybe ties in with Xbox Live Arcade and, you know, Xbox Live and that kind of stuff.
That'd be kind of cool.
So Loki is kind of going serious for once.
This is a little less scary to me.
I won't be like that.
All right, fine, fine.
DarkSakura, your number three answer.
What should Microsoft steal and make better?
Pokemans.
Pokemon, okay.
No, Pokemans.
Oh, I have to say Pokemans.
That's what it's going to be called, is Pokemans.
Okay, Pokemans.
Well, I guess that's true, is that they, you know, there was rumors that they had that little monster-making game.
I guess that was more LittleBigPlanet, though, than Pokemans.
Okay, so Microsoft should make the Pokemon MMO, or the Pokeman MMO.
Pokemans.
Okay.
Alan, your number three answer, what should Microsoft steal and make better?
Colonel Sanders secret recipe for chicken.
Chicken!
Bringing back the chicken reference.
So that way I can, like, go into the Avatar store and get my Avatar, you know, a two-piece and a biscuit or whatever.
By the way, Alan just made a Drag Race reference.
I just want to point out.
You didn't know it, but he did.
How do you spell Colonel?
I can't ever remember.
D-O-L-O-N-E-L Very good, Alan.
I like that.
Alright, the idea that Microsoft should steal and make better.
My number three answer.
The lesbian tester.
DarkSakura.com
The George Foreman Full Cow Grilling Machine
Yes, the machine that can be only put out, I guess, by Microsoft that would take George Foreman grilling to the next level by fully grilling an entire cow at one time.
All right.
Fair enough.
DarkSakura, your number two answer.
An expansion module like the ColecoVision has so you can play other systems games on it.
You remember that, don't you?
I remember you talking about it.
The expansion module number two.
Okay, alright.
Alan, do you have a number two answer?
I want to see something come back like the Dreamcast VMU.
A little memory card with the LED thing.
So memory cards on the... The visual memory unit.
Okay, visual memory cards.
Okay, I like that idea.
That's a good idea.
Any particular reason why that?
Chow's on it.
It will help with the Pokemans.
For the Pokemon game they're going to release.
Okay, very good.
My number two answer.
Let's see, where is my list?
My number two answer for the idea that Xbox should steal and make better.
A game starring a fat plumber and his brother and a game starring a fruity elf with big ears.
DarkSakura.com
Pokemans, The Colonel's Recipe, The Hot Lesbian Tester, George Foreman Full Cow Grilling Machine, an expansion module for other system games, visual memory cards, a game starring a fat plumber and his brother, and a game starring a fruity elf with big ears.
All right.
Now we get down to the number one answers.
The number one thing you most want to see the Xbox 360 steal and make better.
Loki.
Well, if they're going to be guaranteed to make something better, I can't think of a better response than sex.
There's not really much better than sex, but...
I guess that they're going to find a way to make it better.
More power to them.
So yes, Microsoft impressed me about making something better than sex.
There you go.
Make sex better.
DarkSakura!
Dare I ask for your number one answer.
What should they steal and make better?
Rainbow farting unicorns.
Rainbow farting unicorns.
Are you talking about, what is that, robot magic unicorn?
Whatever it is.
What's the name of the game?
Well, my original answer was Propel.
Propel, but you want robot unicorn attack.
Farty robot unicorns.
It's rainbow farting unicorns.
Yeah.
Rainbow farting.
Rainbow farty or farting?
Farting.
Robot unicorn.
That's their special attack is they fart.
There you go.
All right.
To an all erasure soundtrack.
To an all erasure soundtrack.
You got it.
Or Pet Shop Boys works too.
DarkSakura?
You need to let it go.
Okay.
Your number one answer, Alan, what is your number one answer for a thing you want Microsoft to steal and make better?
He's thinking.
I'm blanking.
You're blanking?
After the sex thing, I just can't.
After the sex thing, you just can't?
Can I help you?
Sure.
The Bible.
Okay, yeah.
Jesus.
If they could just do Jesus.
Super Jesus.
You don't want to do the YouTube you sent me earlier?
Alright, fine.
Jesus is the idea that they're going to steal and make better.
Okay.
Oh, Lord.
Alright, and my number one answer I don't know, I just kind of decided to go for the obvious Blu-ray!
They already did, it was HD DVD But it wasn't really better I mean, and they kind of came out at the same time But now that Blu-ray is out They can take Blu-ray and make it better
Alright.
Robot Jesus attack?
That'd be kinda cool.
Here we go!
Here's the list as it stands before the elimination.
A handheld system, Pokemans, The Colonel's Recipe, The Hot Lesbian Tester, George Foreman's Full Cow Grilling Machine, an expansion module for other system games, visual memory cards, a game starring a fat plumber and his brother, and a game starring a fruity elf with big ears, sex, rainbow farting robot unicorns, Jesus, and Blu-ray.
Things that Microsoft is going to steal and make better.
Loki, what is not worthy of being on the list?
Unfortunately, we've got to narrow this down to eight.
It is a tough process.
Feelings will be hurt.
Hair will be pulled.
But it must happen.
Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?
Blu-ray because it's going to get phased out anyways.
You're a bastard.
Alright, Blu-rays off the list.
DarkSakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?
Sex.
You eliminated sex?
It's overrated.
But they're going to make it better.
Come on, better sex.
Okay, this is kind of...
DarkSakura has eliminated sex from the list.
Rob knows why I don't want it on the list.
No, I understand, but it's just funny.
Our chat room is going to yell and scream.
There's going to be hair pulling.
It's boring.
It is boring.
But they're going to make it better.
It'll launch and then all of a sudden, Red Rings.
Oh no.
That's true.
But it won't matter for the guys involved.
They never have a problem.
I don't want Red Rings on my balls.
Alright.
It'll be over before the women enjoy it.
Alright.
Alan, which of these is not worthy?
Oh, DarkSakura's getting booed by chat.
Go in there and regulate, DarkSakura.
Alright.
Alan, which of these is not worthy of the list?
The hot lesbian tester.
Oh, you bastard!
Why?
Do you not love lesbians?
Oh wait, I'm asking the wrong person.
Why are you taking the hot lesbian tester off the list?
I don't know.
Just because it's my answer, huh?
Yeah, yeah.
Dick.
Alright.
You're going to wish that the 360 had the sex support pretty soon.
All right.
The item I'm going to eliminate from the list.
I am taking off the George Foreman full cow grilling machine because that joke is so 2007.
It's the PS3 that looks like one.
I don't want them to copy that.
That's the PS3 things.
Let Sony have something.
Alright, so that's why I've eliminated her from the list.
So, here we go.
Slim can only do Veal.
These are the eight that you can vote for tonight.
A handheld system, Pokemans, The Colonel's Recipe, an expansion module for other system games, visual memory cards, a game starring a fat plumber and his brother, and a game starring a fruity elf with big ears, rainbow farting robot unicorns, and...
Jesus.
Which of these should they steal and make better?
Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your two votes.
And if you want the blur beta code, I have two to give away tonight.
Send in your votes and a message that says, I want the Blur Beta code or something along those lines.
If you don't want the Blur Beta code, don't send me that message, but you can still send me your votes.
So you send me an additional message that says, I want the Blur Beta code.
If you don't know how to send a private message, I will recap that process for you in chat real soon.
For now, back to the show while those votes come in.
Some folks in chat said we made the list boring.
We took off every single interesting answer.
We took off the lesbians, the sex, the meat.
Everything was gone.
By the way, the beta code is only on the 360.
You must have a 360.
Please do not ask for the code if you yourself are not going to use it.
If you sell that shit on eBay, I will find you and I will end your life.
Alright.
Moving on.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Warriors and Archers Xbox 360, PS3, Games for Windows
Was this like the top secret game that Bethesda is supposedly working on that everybody thought was the Blizzard MMO?
I don't know, but it looks like it's just like a hack and slash game.
Looks cool though.
It looks really neat.
But, I mean, I don't know if this is the top secret game they're working on.
And this is Bethesda, not Blizzard.
I meant to say Bethesda.
I say Blizzard.
Sorry, I'm getting distracted with tallying the votes for listless right now.
Let me get to this next story real quick about layoffs at IGN.
Unfortunately, layoffs have...
hit IGN and um yep too bad so sad sorry to hear it uh but unfortunately a lot of folks uh got laid off over at IGN and um I don't know I guess that'll be less podcast all departments all right times are tough I'm sorry times are tough and it's not funny when people lose their jobs but um you know it's tough out there it's hard out there for a pimp what can I say
If they really love games, there'll be people doing it for free, just like many other people do.
So, we'll see.
No one in particular, Rob, right?
No, no one in particular.
Alright, let's get to the mailbag.
Every week you guys send us emails.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and we read some here on air.
DarkSakura is going to open up the mailbag, rip it right open, and pull out some of her favorite emails.
I'm reading them for you right now.
I would be happy to, but my window that had all the emails on it actually just completely vanished, so I have to reopen them.
Can you reopen it real quick?
Okay, because I've got to tally the cage match votes here.
Yeah, sorry, listless votes.
I'm pulling it back up.
Okay.
Keep your pants on.
I don't want dead air.
Loki, what are you watching over there?
Here we go.
I've got the first one.
I'm watching a violent video of someone making levels in WarioWare DIY, like blowing someone in half.
Here's another one.
They're shooting them.
Shooting with rainbow farts?
Sniper rifle.
This is from Cheeseburger.
Yay.
Hey, OLR.
As you may or may not know, I've been saving up for gaming PC for a year now.
I finally got the money just this morning and I spent $1,300 at Newegg.
This PC will be good enough to run almost any game on near highest settings.
The only games I have right now are World of Warcraft.
Addict!
and Command & Conquer 3.
In a few hours, I'm hoping to win an eBay auction of Crysis.
My question is, do you have any recommendations for games I should get?
When the game was released, it was no matter, just that they are good games.
I suggest Loom.
And Star Trek Online.
I don't know, some of the Borderlands is pretty cool if you don't have that.
He also sends a follow-up to the email.
Forgot to mention in my last email, yesterday my friend had a 16th birthday party at John's Incredible Pizza.
I know, what a place for that.
And I was wondering, why have you given it the title John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza?
Wait, wait, we have somebody here local that's been to John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza?
Because those are only in NorCal.
As far as I know, unless they really grew fast.
Well, did you eat the pizza when you were there?
It's kind of shitty.
And it's been sitting out for a long time, and little kids put their hands all over it and all that stuff.
No, the place is okay.
I mean, actually, I gotta say, it was really cool, because one of the workers there once, like, recognized us.
I don't know how, but they did, and I thought that was really awesome.
And Dan was there, too.
Exactly.
So, you know, no.
They're fine.
I have nothing against John's Incredible Pizza, but it's a fun... The place was pretty fun.
The pizza was pretty suck.
Alright, there you go.
Alright.
From Robert M. From my last email a month or two ago, I tried to be clever and use a reference to the spam filters used on your forum discussion on the show, so my email was most likely lost to the spam filters.
Sorry about that.
My question now is, how long are the animations for the summons for Final Fantasy XIII, and can they be skipped?
My brother, back in the day, generally enjoyed Final Fantasy VII, but was turned off by the summons taking about, what, 10 to 15 seconds every time?
which can actually add up to get repetitive over the course of your typical 40 hour JRPG lifespan.
Rob?
Sorry, I'm focusing on tallying votes.
What was the question?
How long are the summon scenes?
We have a shit ton of votes tonight.
How long are the summon scenes?
Not very long.
No, I don't think you can, but they're not very long.
No, you can skip them.
I wish you could skip Knights of the Round.
Seriously, when I would do Knights of the Round on Quadra Magic and then Mimic, I had time to go make a sandwich.
Fix myself a drink.
Come back.
I love how that when Square heard all of the complaints about Knights of the Round for 7 and they're like, how can we get around this for 8?
They're like, oh, I know.
Let's make it so we have to watch the summon and tap Square for the boost.
Do you remember that?
That was their answer to that?
To make you watch it with the power up?
Yeah.
That was funny.
Next up... And that's all part of the reason why I hated 8, just so you know.
This person didn't sign it, so I'm just going to say person who didn't sign their email.
Have been wondering, have been enjoying the... Or maybe I'll just use the first part of their email, Sepwin, I guess.
Have been enjoying the show for a while.
One comment about Microsoft's Project Natal.
You mentioned one thing they showed were racing games.
As someone who's gotten heavy into sim racing games, I think that wouldn't work well even for arcade racers.
The main reason is there would be no rumble or forced feedback to the player.
For any racing game that isn't meant to be a total arcade experience, a wheel with feedback, preferably forced feedback, is critical.
I would argue even burnout games need some sort of tactile response to the player.
Best wishes.
I agree, actually.
That's what I kind of like.
Like, what was it that Rush had really crazy feedback?
And it actually made it really fun to play, I thought.
You know, added a much bigger level into the control.
Anyway, last email.
Subject, Rogue Kitty.
Okay.
I'll be where President Cat has gone.
Rogue Kitty shall forever be known as Dictator Cat.
Mwahaha Snow Villagers.
Okay.
I guess.
It came with a picture.
Oh.
War on string may be unwinnable, says General Cat.
That's funny.
I'm going to save the picture.
I'll upload it somewhere.
Perhaps our photo thing.
Perhaps.
Anyway, that's the last of it.
I'm not done telling votes yet, but we have some more news to get to, right?
Or no, we got the FUs of the week.
Some angst.
Every week we like to take a little bit of our time out and get some angst out and some anger.
And hopefully there's enough of it tonight to get me through the rest of the cage match votes.
I keep saying cage match.
Listless votes.
Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week, boys and girls.
Um, FU to my digestion.
Really, that's it.
Loki.
Um, I'm gonna have to say FU to, um, I don't really know.
I don't have anything.
I guess the lawn being too long.
I don't know.
Uh, Alan, do you have an FU this week?
FUs to unemployment.
Unemployment.
My FU goes to all the boxes on my kitchen table.
That's my FU of the week.
All right.
Usually I would be doing the listless results right now, but I'm not ready.
We had so many tonight that I'm not ready.
This is where I had it in our list, but I'll have to jump in later.
So, Loki, would you do another story for us, please?
By the way, we will be opening the Skype line in just a little bit, but we have an interview with our friend Aaron in just a moment.
So stay tuned.
Yes, apparently Bungie has re-registered or registered new trademarks for Marathon and Bungie Aerospace.
Well, Marathon, of course, is their first FPS that they released way back in the day, so perhaps a new game in that series.
Bungie Aerospace, not exactly sure what the hell that's about, but...
Bungie Aerospace
Is this some type of further Halo thing, or does this give us some type of idea what they're actually going to be doing after Halo?
Not really.
Other than it being a trademark.
I mean, obviously, I would imagine Marathon's going to be coming at some point.
Didn't they release Marathon on Xbox Live Arcade, and I don't remember it being very good.
I don't remember Marathon.
No, they did.
They did.
Yeah, it was... Well, you know, it was an old game.
Whatever.
Hmm.
Would you mind doing the next story too?
Because I am still trying to tally votes.
That's how many people we had voting tonight.
Throw in a beta code and that's what we got.
Okay.
Apparently the Commodore 64 is making a return.
Yes.
A brand new, I guess, keyboard.
It looks like it's all inclusive in this keyboard.
Yeah.
based on, they're saying, the Cybernet ZPC GX31.
And it's kind of cool looking, a little futuristic thing.
It's got a... I think a lot of those pictures... I'm finally done, sorry.
I think a lot of those pictures were prototypes.
Like, they're not the actual thing, especially like that one where you see the old-ass system running Windows 95.
Oh, yeah.
Windows XP is, yeah.
Yeah.
obviously a little bit silly but dude I'm all about the Commodore 64 making a comeback because there was some that was like again I'm hoping it's not something that I view in a greater light because it was when I was young but there were just some awesome programs on the 64 and I love the fact here's the number one reason the 64 was awesome you could hook it up to your TV that's why that's why I won the computer wars I'm telling you at least back in the 80s the personal computer wars before the IBM's so that's kind of neat all right
I'm finally ready.
By the way, if they released a new Commodore 64, what do you think they should put on it?
I don't know.
Peggle?
Peggle.
A bunch of music-making software would be good.
Mario Paint?
Yeah.
Let me put it this way, though.
The Commodore 64 would probably have more applications than an Apple PC or an Apple computer.
Hopefully it would be backwards compatible.
So let's get to the listless results tonight.
We're going to do the listless results.
Play the music!
for third place.
A tie for the number three thing you most want to see Microsoft improve on.
By the way, this is it.
There is no arguing.
This is a very scientific process.
Microsoft, if you're listening, here it is.
Number three, the masses want Pokemans.
They want you to take the Pokemans and make them better.
And tied with that, you might have to fry those Pokemans in the Colonel's Secret Recipe because you've got to make that better too.
The Colonel's Recipe and Pokemans tying for third place tonight.
Second place tonight, Visual Memory Cards is what they want you to steal and make better.
VMUs.
You need to take those and make them better.
And lastly, the number one thing that Microsoft needs to steal and make better, the PSP, a handheld system.
That's right.
Microsoft, we want a handheld system as voted by our chatters.
That's it.
No arguing.
We're done.
Windows Mobile, not going to cut it.
You need to steal the PSP and make it better.
There are two parts to this tonight.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 people want the beta, oh no, 11 people want the beta code.
Alan, pick a number between 1 and 11 if you wouldn't mind.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
Amaze Satsuma wins a Blur Beta Code.
So congratulations to you guys.
Sorry to everyone else, but there it is.
So Llama Juice and Amaze Satsuma win Beta Codes just for voting and participating in the show tonight.
You can too, Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right at AllGamesRadio, AllGames.com.
Alright, we're going to get to the Skype line in a minute, although I was hoping to speak to Aaron, but I closed the number with his phone number.
When I was tallying all the votes, I closed the window with his number, so now I'm waiting for it.
So there it is.
Also, I need to send those codes.
So I'm going to send those codes.
Loki, do you have any quick last-minute stories to work in here while I wait to hopefully hear from Aaron?
Alan Wake, several download content episodes are due out this year.
Second season possibly available depending on the audience.
I don't know if they buy it or not or how well the first season does.
That's kind of neat.
Kind of reminds me of what they're doing with Heavy Rain.
They're going to be releasing some download content seasons for that.
And of course the game is set to hit shelves on May 18th on the Xbox 360.
Let's see here.
I don't know what they're doing with this, but their casting apparently has been released for the Kane and Lynch film.
And Kane, pretty cool.
They're going to have Bruce Willis to play Kane.
Lynch, however, is being played by Jamie Foxx, who I might add looks absolutely nothing like the character of Lynch.
He's a good actor, though.
And if you think about it, not to be all racist or anything, but a black man playing a character named Lynch is a little weird, if you ask me.
Wow.
Wow.
I have no response for that at all.
I'm just saying, okay?
But seriously, though, Jamie Foxx, great actor.
But he looks nothing like the character.
Billy Bob Thornton looks more like the character, I think.
Of course, he's a horrible actor.
Well, at least now he's a horrible actor.
Well, I think, you know, with makeup and so forth, they'll give him the mullet and the glasses and everything he needs.
But he's gonna look weird in the mullet and glasses.
I mean, he's... It's a different race.
It's like as bad as the whole Chung-Li thing in the last Street Fighter movie.
Not Asian, doesn't look anything like Chung Li Oh, and can't act By the way, BondsS006 in chat says I am black myself and I say no And to what Loki said, yes, yes, yes Same thing ran through my head, WTF So maybe Loki is not as insensitive as we all think Every time I see the Prince of Persia trailer With Jake Gyllenhaal in the movie theater Every time I see that trailer, I just want to scream out He's white!
Like to the theater Just, yeah You should
I have to add, this is completely off topic here, but they finally released the riff tracks for the new Twilight movie.
I am very excited to watch that.
Not that I'm excited to watch the Twilight movies, but the riff tracks were fucking hilarious.
And we watched it with The Happening.
Oh my god, completely different movie watching that.
It was just ridiculously funny.
No phone number yet.
No, I got it.
I got it.
I'm sorry.
I was just waiting for the conversation to finish because good times.
I like it when you say things that will get you in trouble.
All right.
So we're going to give our good buddy Aaron, also known as YYR, a call because he has a brand new game on the Xbox Live Marketplace in the indie game section.
And we want to talk to him about it.
So let's get him on the line.
We're going to call him on our Skype line right now.
And then we'll open up the Skype line for anybody to call in at 1-877-GAME.
Hey, Aaron, how you doing?
I figured it was you.
Hey, how'd you know?
It wasn't just the whole back and forth about he ran off to get a drink at just the wrong moment.
How you doing, Aaron?
Congratulations, you released a game tonight.
I'm doing okay, which is pretty cool considering this has been a bumpy ride.
Losing power from last Saturday night through this Thursday evening and basically shacking up with my parents and doing all that I could from there.
Working on convention crap for most of the weekend And now I think I'm coming down with a cold Oh goody, now that's right, you're going to be at PAX East, right?
Now you're showing off Snake 360 in your latest game at a booth there?
I'm going to have all four of my games Three of them will have been released up to that point And the fourth I thought would probably have been released But it's failed review on a technicality Uh oh
It's coming soon, and you get to play it first.
How cool is that?
Hey, there you go.
Hey, that's some reason why people want to go to PAX is to play the games first.
And by the way, Ziba in our chat room is suggesting take some Airborne.
But SH100Matt says it doesn't work.
So, vitamins.
All right, well, let's talk about your latest game.
So tonight on Xbox Live Marketplace, you released a game called Falling.
We have a little clip so you can hear some of the music.
Yeah, that sounds familiar.
Well, basically what it kind of is, is it's a puzzle-type game at its core.
Damn that walrus!
So what you need to do is clean up the mess and then crush Wally before he causes trouble, which of course is touching you, you die.
But, you know, at first also Wally starts off stupid.
He just kind of walks back and forth and waits for you to crush him, either by pushing a block on him or...
You know, dropping it on his head or whatever, but then later on he can push blocks around, he can jump over things, he can kick blocks at your face, you know, just generally make life miserable for you.
So, you know, you gotta get rid of him and you also have to clear the blocks by throwing or kicking the same colored blocks into each other.
So, you know, you're matching colors, you're avoiding walking walruses and, you know, just generally things get pretty chaotic later in the game and
It's fun, it's got the retro vibe, and it plays a lot like a frenetic arcade experience.
I like to compare it to something like Bubble Bobble, where it starts off simple and then it gets very complex and very action-packed.
I feel it does have the kind of lasting enjoyment that a game like that used to have.
I think I pretty much captured that spirit.
It definitely looks like something that could be from Game Room.
It's kind of that old, kind of retro look to it.
It seems like this game is coming out just in time, honestly, for everything.
Yeah, well, I mean, I hope people download it and they...
You know, they get the same kind of feelings that they get when they play one of their favorite old games.
And then I hope they buy it.
So you can't get the trial in the marketplace right now.
I'm going to go ahead and let the... Oh, you have several videos up here on YouTube, don't you?
You have, like, an attract mode, some other gameplay clips.
Let's try one of these other clips here on the YouTube.
Now, you posted some clips of the game.
This is round 10 we're going to look at now.
So I'm imagining things get a little more intense in this level.
The bricks fall faster.
Yeah.
Actually, I was playing on hard difficulty when I made that video, so it's kind of nuts.
I don't think, I think that video ends with my death, actually.
Now, there's multiple, there's wal-rye.
There's multiple walrus.
Walruses.
Oh, yeah, they come in packs.
Oh, my gosh.
They're like real walruses.
Actually, I'm not basing that statement on any fact whatsoever.
Okay, I've got to ask you.
This seems like the most obvious question.
Where did the inspiration for a game like this come from?
Did this come to you in a dream or something?
Little Penguin's going to get his home invaded by walruses.
Where the hell did you come up with this?
Well, to be completely honest, the entire concept for the game started with my, I guess now, ex-fiance's obsession with Piplup.
That is completely true.
And I wanted to make a game with a penguin in it.
And I thought, okay, blocks are falling from the ceiling.
And then I thought, okay, something has to come and be an antagonist.
And then, you know, I figured, well, you know, I think I heard somewhere that walruses in real life don't like penguins.
So I started going with that.
And then when I had already drawn all the sprites, I decided to actually look this up.
And according to stuff I found on Wikipedia, the simple fact of the matter is
So you found out that walruses and penguins were like mortal enemies and you're like, there's a game there.
That's exactly what I was going for.
I totally just basically wanted to make it feel like an old arcade game.
From the moment you power up the machine and you see the ROM test and it puts the option settings on the screen for a fraction of a second to going into the options and being able to adjust how many coins the game costs.
It's all in there.
Nice.
But no real coins.
It's much different than Game Room, where Game Room charges you 50 cents a play, but that won't happen here, right?
No, no.
You can try it for free, just like all indie games.
And if you spend 80 space bucks, just 80 space bucks, you can play it as much as you want for as long as you want.
I think I caught, how many space bucks was that?
80.
$1.
$1?
That's a steal.
That's great.
Now, what is this?
I noticed, I just caught this briefly at the end of the attract screen here, that when it's showing the high score table, it looks like the default scores say, import Futari now?
What is that?
Oh, nothing.
No, that's a direct reference to Mushihime Sama Futari, the cave shooting game released last year.
Actually, there's another game that I'm releasing soon called Sharpshooter, and I make a reference to DJ Max Technica and its high score tables.
I'm all about referencing other games, other stuff.
In fact, before we end this conversation, I would like to actually directly reference one of the in-game references that I have actually in all my games, and I'm turning that into a giveaway for three of our chat roomers.
Okay, so what, the chatters have to know what it is that all your games have in common, or what's the deal?
Well, do you want to do it now?
Sure, why not?
Okay, well, in every game that I've released so far, Snake360, Card Arcade, Falling, and also in the game that I'm releasing next month, Sharpshooter, and by the way, all those games will be on display at PAX East, and I hope that
Everyone who comes to PAX East will come to our booth and have a really great time.
I'm going to be next to Mommy's Best Games, and they're going to have a bunch of great stuff too, including an unreleased game called Grapple Buggy.
So, you know, come, play the games.
I'm going to be running Snake360 tournaments all weekend long.
You can compete for prizes, t-shirts, soundtrack CDs.
Like, I decided to go all out with this.
So...
But at any rate, no, it's not OL or G related Thank you, chat But I will absolutely stop by the booth Absolutely, I'll be stopping by to say hello I am looking forward to meeting you Absolutely, I'll be by I don't know what I'm wearing yet Everybody's asking me, what are you wearing?
So I can spot you and see you I don't know I was hoping to have my frilly orange scarf But it looks like I'll have to save that for PAX Prime
Hi, I have this thing called homework.
I know.
Bakers can't be choosers.
But I'll find something creative.
Well, I know my friend Amanda plans to wear a corset one day.
So I was thinking, well, I could wear a corset.
But I don't know how well that would go over.
So we'll have to see.
Stay tuned to the Twitter, folks.
I'll let you know.
All right.
But anyway, back to the giveaway.
Yes.
So, in all of the games that I have released or am releasing, I have a number in there.
It's usually in the form of one of the high score numbers, and it's a direct reference to a video game company.
The first three people to type it into chat get a code to download following for free.
Woohoo!
Free falling.
Save that dollar by typing that number into chat right now.
Not the number.
I don't need the number.
I need the video game company that I referenced.
Oops, my bad.
It's not Konami.
My bad.
The video game company he references and he flat out has told you it is not Konami.
So go ahead and guess.
There it is.
And you know what?
And you know what?
Yeah, I'm not seeing it yet, so I'm just going to say what the number is.
Okay.
It's 765-
765 It's not Konami, it's not Bungie I see it, I'm waiting for two other people to say it before I confirm it What's the list of what it's not?
It's not Konami, and the number is 765
Okay, three people wrote Namco, we're done Oh, Namco, tell us a little more about the reference to Namco Yes, I'm basically a Namco fangirl So many of Namco's games are on my all-time list of favorites that I couldn't possibly not be a Namco fangirl
I'm basically referencing them in, well, everything.
I apologize for the listeners that have heard this story 5,000 times, but you know I love this story.
In the Namco PS3 game, the Namco Treasures Volume 1, there is a direct OLR reference in your face.
Really?
Yes, when
Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki
Oh wow, I gotta go run and check that right now No kidding, it's on the PS3 and it's the Namco Treasures Volume 1 It's the one that has like Pac-Man and all that stuff I think I actually downloaded that I don't know if I still have it on the hard drive But if not, I'm getting it again But it's not in the demo, I just want to make that clear You will not see it in the demo, that splash screen is only in the full version Because the way the PS3 works is funky Your demo is like completely separate from your regular game It's not like the 360 where you upgrade I'm not happy about it either
yeah so again if you hadn't heard that story before I love that story so much I totally support that yeah it's that's when you know you made it we've been doing this show for eight years to get our name in a video game was amazing so we were very happy about that
I started falling, I'd say probably around September or October of last year
and now granted I was working on Sharpshooter which is my release for next month at the same time and by the way if you're developing a game I would very very strongly recommend that you never ever try to work on two at the same time because as with most things it'll probably wind up taking you longer you know to finish both than if you just did one and then the other but yeah it does take a while because you know it's
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
One thing I say to people, people really just don't realize how much time goes into a game.
The next time you're walking through a 3D environment in a first-person shooter, don't just run past that intricately designed building and never look at it again.
Actually take the time to look at it and admire what a bunch of designers worked on because they spent hours on that and we run past it in five seconds.
It's amazing all the detail that goes into that type of work.
It's kind of like a movie.
The list of credits at the end of the movie, it really does take that many people to make a movie.
But this game, Falling, was made by one guy.
Yeah, that's me.
I hope so too.
Remember the three lucky winners.
Watch your PMs.
I'm just looking to get my name out there and maybe make enough to someday do this for a living.
That's all.
I'm not looking to make a fortune or anything.
That sounds like a fair compromise.
We'll see you at PAX East, Aaron.
Alrighty, see you there.
Alright, I'll probably be assaulting you with a microphone there too, just so you know.
That's just fine.
Alright, good luck.
See you at the show.
See you later
Which I think is kind of interesting So yeah, that's very cool So congratulations to Derek on that accomplishment Who knows, maybe Falling being a retro game could be next Who knows, we'll see I don't know if that'll open the floodgates But congrats to all of our friends that are indie developers Man, it takes a lot of work I wish I had that kind of talent I would make an OLR game, I think that would be fun But we'll see Alright, are we ready to go to the phones and take some calls tonight?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Power Gig Rise of the Six String
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Yes, I did.
Have fun with that.
Good luck with that.
All right.
Hopefully your video doesn't screw up our bandwidth, but we'll see what happens.
Oh, no.
He shut it off.
All right.
That's right.
What's up?
What's up, Lama Juice?
Sorry about that.
No, that's okay.
It's cool.
What's on your mind?
I went down to GDC in San Francisco last week-ish.
Yeah.
And I don't know if you guys – I got to the show late last week, so I didn't get to hear about anything you guys were talking about.
No, we didn't go to the show, which is funny because we're not that – you must be in the area because we're just in Sacramento, so we're not that far from San Francisco.
In fact, Alan is from there, so I go there all of the time, and I was there that weekend.
But GDC, they don't really let media people in.
So I didn't go.
They actually do have media passes.
You should try that next time.
Yeah, but unfortunately, it's kind of one of those double-edged swords.
Indie podcasters aren't really media enough for them.
Fair enough.
So you have to work for IGN or, well, I guess the media passes will be opening up next time.
All right.
So how was GDC?
What did you think?
um the conference itself was really awesome I'm an environment artist trying to get a job so for to go there it was basically a giant job fair you know with all the big companies and what not trying to hire people um but what was neat is that like all of the all of the different like Sony and Microsoft had booths there too showing off all their stuff and uh
Sony was showing off their PlayStation Move.
Did you get your hands on it?
Yes.
Ah, I want to know what you thought then.
I definitely want to know what you thought of Move.
I was out opening day picking up the Wii.
I was out there waiting outside for 14 hours.
And the Move puts the Wii to shame, hands down.
Wow, that's a pretty bold statement.
The controls for it were extremely responsive.
Yeah.
The demos that they showed were, it was a lot of really, really cheesy stuff.
Like there was a little game where you made bubbles and a monkey tried to pop the bubbles.
But as far as the controlling of it all went, it was very one-to-one, very, very quick and responsive.
Is that all you played was the monkey bubble game or were there other stuff that you got to check out?
There was the Monkey Bubble game.
There was that tech demo that they showed at E3 right when they showed it off.
They had that there.
And then they had some other game that I watched some girl play where she was swinging some swords and mallets or something around.
And she was getting really into it.
And it looked like it was very responsive as to what she was doing and all that.
Yeah.
They were showing that if you have the two controllers, the camera itself can actually do face tracking as well.
and so the camera can see your face and the two remotes and then guess where your arms are and all that and so it tries to do sensing where your body is and so if you're ducking and stuff like that it can try to replicate that with a character on screen.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
although, you know, I think we all see it as a logical step for Sony and we all know they've had more time now to perfect the technology, so it better be better but the big question is does it have the games to substantiate it?
Because, you know, if it's just another bunch of little mini party games and so forth, then what's the point?
Do you think, from what you observed, that Move has the, let's just go back to the old OLR golden rule a video game system is only as good as the games that are on it Do you think that
Move has the games to substantiate the controller.
From what they showed at GDC, they really only showed one game, like one full game with it, and I didn't really see much of it.
But I was talking to the guy that, like the main guy behind the whole technology of it all, and he was saying that the new SOCOM that's going to be coming out is going to be using it very in-depth.
and so he's saying that the controls for that are going to be pretty sweet.
So if SOCOM's going to be using it, I guess that's a really big title for Sony.
I don't have a PS3, so I don't know.
Then even better, is this the type of peripheral that makes you want to get one?
Kind of.
I've always been a sucker for the gimmicky crap in games.
I got the Game Boy printer, the e-reader, I bought the Wii opening day, all that kind of stuff.
And so this kind of thing, it does make me want to buy a PS3.
The guy said that...
As far as prices, the unit's going to come out with a controller, a game, and the camera all under $100 when it comes out.
Yeah, I remember that.
They did have a little press conference where they said some of that.
But yeah, I wonder if it's going to be the Monkey Bubble game or what it's going to be.
So we'll see.
Well, real quickly, before we let you go, because we want to get at least one more call tonight, were there any other quick thoughts you had about GDC or something really interesting?
Did you attend any panels or seminars or what have you that you just thought were awesome that you want to share?
um sadly I didn't get to go to any of the they call them summits there um I didn't get to go to any of those because I got the cheap pass which was still $250 right oh wow plus I live in Orlando so uh I didn't really have the extra oh you came all the way out here just for that then wow cool
Yep.
But what I will say is, if you don't mind a little plug here.
Go ahead.
I did a vlog every day as I was out there, recorded anything fun that I saw at the expo.
If you want to see any of that, I have a YouTube channel, youtube.com slash llama juice, all one word.
Yeah.
So if you go there, you can see a lot of the cool stuff they had at the expo.
They had a lot of virtual reality stuff going on, a lot of 3D glasses with gaming, a lot of stuff like that going on.
It was some pretty cool technology going on there.
Alright, so check that out on YouTube.
We'll go ahead and let you plug that, especially because we weren't out there ourselves, so I might actually be going to look and see what it was like out there on the show floor.
So, Lama Juice, good luck with Blur, good luck with your schooling for all the environmental stuff, and we'll see you later on the show, okay?
Sounds like a plan.
Alright, take care, buddy.
Yep, you too.
Later.
We'll take like one more call, guys, and I really apologize in advance for those folks that don't get through tonight.
Please, please, please don't be afraid to send us an email, send us some tweets, one of the other ways.
It's just that our show is running really long tonight, so we wanted to just take a couple more calls, you guys.
I'm just going to take this first one here.
Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio.
Who's this?
Good morning.
This is G-Ditz calling in.
Hi, G-Ditz.
Oh, it's the other Swede, right?
Oh yes.
Ah, how are you, my friend?
How's it going?
I'm not too bad.
A bit tired.
I've been up since 2am.
That is hardcore, my friend.
Hardcore.
It's always worth it.
Always worth it.
I really appreciate your support.
Well, what's on your mind?
Please, you've stayed up late to talk to us.
What's up?
You already talked about it, I think, but I just want to talk a bit more about Cave Story and its awesomeness.
If you haven't played it, you really, really need to play it, because it's freeware on PC, and if you really like it on PC, you can always buy it on WiiWare, because he really deserves it.
It's just one guy who made one of the most awesome games ever.
Where can people get this game?
Uh, I think there's a different, like a tribute site that has a download with an English patch, because the guy who made it is Japanese.
Oh, okay.
But I don't think he has his own, like, developer site.
It's Studio Pixel, I think he calls himself.
He's usually just referred to as Pixel.
Now, what's it about this game that just made you fall in love with it?
It's sort of retro, the music's awesome, the story's actually kind of entertaining, and it has a couple of twists.
It's not your usual Mario, oh, the princess is in another castle.
You can't really predict what's going to happen.
It's just an unexplored fantasy world that you've never seen before.
I like the price of free.
That's good.
Has anybody been able to follow the guy?
I know there's the language differences, but has anybody been able to follow the guy and see if there's a chance of this, I don't know, being an indie game on Xbox Live or coming out somewhere else besides just the PC?
Yeah.
I'm not sure.
It is coming out on WiiWare, and I think they had a report on the Wii Channel with him and the American developers who met with him and made the port.
But I'm not sure.
Maybe they have an exclusivity deal with Nintendo, because they probably want to keep that.
Maybe, maybe there's a WiiWare thing coming up.
And I do notice, by the way, speaking of WiiWare, I guess Dark Tetsuya is all excited.
I think La Mulan is released, must be tomorrow, because I can't think of what else Dark Tetsuya would be excited over.
But I know he's in there.
By the way, did you know, Dark Sakura, I know you've been busy with your stuff, but Rondo of Blood finally saw the light of day on Monday.
So part of me wants to hook up the Wii and get that.
You should.
I do.
I need to, but it's in a box.
Rob.
What?
You know how we were supposed to hang out last week and we didn't?
I know.
I can't this way.
I'm going to Boston.
I know.
I'm going to Boston.
When you're back.
Okay.
Rondo of Blood.
We need to do our show that we've talked about.
Yes, we do.
We can start with Rondo of Blood.
It would be fun.
Anyway, hi.
Yeah.
Sorry, listener.
Well, DarkSakura and I have an argument.
Jiditz, I guess I'll ask you, is there anything else on your mind tonight?
You said last time that you wanted to know the phrases in different languages from people calling in.
Yes.
So I thought I'd just... Saying like hi is just hey or hello.
Oh, that's easy.
Hello.
Basically hello.
Hello.
Yeah, hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Okay, I can do that.
And goodbye is like heydor.
Heydor.
Yeah, heydor.
Heydor.
Excellent.
Can you go out to the barn and close the hay door?
All right, I'll try.
All right.
No, I really appreciate that.
And now I need Aki Ripper to call in next, which, by the way, too bad we already did our game show tonight because you and Aki Ripper are both listening tonight.
We could have had a sweet off.
I know you already decided to bow down and let Aki Ripper have the title, but damn it, I wanted my sweet off.
But I guess it is to be for another day.
We are running way too long tonight.
I think we're like to three and a half hours at this point.
I almost have to go to school soon.
We gotta go and wrap this up.
You better get to school, young man.
We'll talk to you later, okay?
have a good one buddy same to you, bye
Alright, now's the part of the show where we wrap it all up.
I think we got all of Loki's last minute stories.
DarkSakura, I don't know if you had any.
I was mesmerized by reading about the healthcare passing.
Yeah, it's on a lot of people's minds today.
I don't want to get too political, but it's definitely a historical day.
It's a day that will be remembered.
I was just looking to find out what the specifics were because keep in mind all I've been hearing is all the crap from my Republican slash Libertarian family.
And while I have a good deal in common with the Libertarian platform, there are certain things that I think need to be done.
I'm not going to go into it, but I've been trying to see what exactly made it.
So what exactly is this again?
Is this that national health care thing?
Do I have to pay more taxes for people that don't have jobs so they can get their fucking health care?
Because that's what it seems like it's like anyways already.
I think they are going to tax the really high, high, high plans, like the Cadillac plans.
That was what I was just reading about.
If you have a really nice plan, you might, but if your plan has any deductibles or anything like that, it's probably not one of those plans.
Well, the biggest thing on here is that...
Instead of treating symptoms with excess drugs, basically the car dealer type of deal where you get more money for the options that go with it, then the focus will be on curing the problem and not the symptoms of the problem, not treating the symptoms, not getting a kickback for selling prescriptions, basically.
I will say this much.
I don't want to get too much into what I do for a living and to earn my paychecks, but I do work for a big healthcare company here in California, and I'll just say I'm really interested for work tomorrow.
It's going to be a heck of a day tomorrow, so I'm very curious to see what's going to happen.
But, you know, change is always inevitable, and I think this is one of those things that...
was going to happen, so we'll see what happens.
My only, I will just say this, my only concern about the whole thing is that I think that all of the other government programs need major revamping because I think that yeah, you can change one thing, but you really have to look at what the absolute root of the problem is, and I think that that's with the government itself.
I don't know necessarily that I trust them with my money.
I just hope we get a new trauma center game out of all this.
That's what I really want.
Trauma center, healthcare bill.
Laughter
Trauma Center Senate!
No, it was, it was like, you know, they're, they're playing the game or whatever and he's doing the apology and all of a sudden, you know, she comes up on stage and starts like beating him up with the, uh, with the golf club and she uses the prenup, uh, power up and stuff like that.
It was pretty funny.
I love SSJ100Matt's comment and I'm even going to make it my final thought tonight.
So we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought tonight and I'm going to leave it with what SSJ100Matt said because I think it's great.
Change.
It's always good because you can take it all to Coinstar.
Loki, your final thought tonight.
I need me some money.
Alan, thank you for being here on the show tonight.
I hope you got to say more than you did last time.
I think you did.
Participating in Listless really helped you.
Is there any final thought you have tonight?
I want tacos.
We'll get tacos.
We'll get you tacos.
You want Del Taco or Taco Bell?
Del Taco.
All right.
See?
Look what I've turned him into.
This Bay Area kid has fallen in love with Del Taco.
I love it.
Dark Sakura, thanks for strolling in late tonight.
We appreciate it.
It's my house.
I know.
I'm kidding.
If you don't like it, you get the fuck out.
Dark Sakura, your final thought tonight.
Mmm, horseradish is still burning.
