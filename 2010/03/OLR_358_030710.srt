1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The following program is intended for mature audiences.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Here's your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Lowkey.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Tonight, March 7th, 2010, we get first impressions on Final Fantasy XIII.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:31,000
One of our favorite games is patched with teasers of a sequel, and the Rock Band Network goes live.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I come bearing a message from President Catt.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Here in California, home of Silicon Valley, home of video games, we are in a budget crisis.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
State employees are furloughed, meaning we can't go to the DMV most Fridays.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Students are protesting out on the freeways amidst high tuition cutbacks.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yet somehow, our legislatures found the time last week to pass a resolution

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
supporting Anti-Cussing Week to take place this very week.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Residents are encouraged to refrain from cussing and donate swear jar money to charity

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
because swearing bothers some 14-year-old in Southern California.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Apparently, swearing profusely shows a lack of intelligence or some sort of lack of character.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
However, substituting words like opicles and sassafras, which have all of the same intent,

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
is somehow okay and makes you a smarter person.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
As residents of the state of California, we reject this notion.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
As intelligent individuals, we take offense to the notion

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
that using versatile swear words somehow demonstrates a lack of intelligence.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
As free citizens of the United States of America living under the First Amendment,

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
we say, fuck yeah, to free speech.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We will work tonight in protest of No Cussing Week

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
to break the record for most uses of the F-word on an internet podcast.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Tonight, on a very special Orange Lounge radio, we bring you The Fuck Show.

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Welcome to another fucking week of Orange Lounge fucking radio.

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
My name is Rob, Fucking Roberts, here with you every week as always.

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Say hello to the one and only fucking wonderful Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Well, fuckity fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
How the fuck are you tonight, young lady?

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Fucking rad. And pissed off.

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Why are you so fucking pissed off tonight?

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Because people just annoy the fuck out of me.

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Why? What did they do? What ruffled your fucking feathers this week?

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm just fucking annoyed at people feeling like they have to defend their own fucking opinion

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
every fucking time someone says something that's different from them. So fuck them.

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Not really fuck them, but just fuck in general.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I know, just fuck them. Right in their fucking ears.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Hey, say hello to the one and only, he is so fucking smart, tech master, Loki.

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I keep fucking coughing. I wish this fucking gold go away.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You have been fucking sick for like 30 fucking weeks now.

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I haven't been coughing all day long, but then all of a sudden this fucking coughing started after I ate all of my chicken.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Would you like some tea?

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
No, I really hate fucking tea. Tea is awful.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
No, I think it's the root beer. And while delicious the root beer was, it makes me cough. And that's not good.

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Are you allergic to fucking root beer?

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
No, I am not allergic to root beer. Root beer is awesome.

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's just, you know, the carbonation or whatever kind of loosens the fucking phlegm in my throat.

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So, it sucks. But yeah, otherwise I'm fine. I'm fucking great.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Alright, glad to hear it.

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Alright, well folks, we do have some gaming news to get into a little later.

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But first, we always fucking start off the show talking about our fucking gaming weeks.

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Like, anybody really gives a fuck what we've been playing.

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But that's just how you do a video game podcast.

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We've been doing it a very fucking long time, about eight years.

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So, we used to start with a little segment called How Was Your Day? How Was Your Week?

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But no one really gave a shit. So, we evolved it to fucking video games.

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So, how the fuck was your gaming week, DarkSakura?

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It was fucking boring.

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I played Star Trek Online and made it to Lieutenant Commander. Finally, fuck yeah.

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And got this weird Klingon chick and a Bajoran dude, but fuck him.

62
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And that's about all. I didn't do fuck all.

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Alright. It's more fucking Star Trek Online, same fucking story every fucking week.

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
But that's alright. That's what it's like to be fucking addicted to an MMO. I should know.

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm not addicted. Fuck you.

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay, sorry. Maybe not fucking addicted, but fucking...

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I set a day. A day that is my fuck off day. Where I do fuck all.

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But play my damn game and fuck around on the internet.

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I think it's good to have a fuck off day. I have fuck off days on days ending in one.

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I have actually started a project. A fantastic fucking project.

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
That does not involve fucking, by the way.

72
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Called Project Real Life. Where this thing, this evil box, this fucking whore of a computer gets turned off.

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
How the fuck are you able to function?

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But you're fucking playing the game in real life. So I don't understand what the fucking point is.

75
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm paying attention to my own fucking real life.

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Well fuck me then. No thank you.

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Alright. Loki, how the fuck was your gaming week?

78
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Well let's talk about how awesome my gaming week was.

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
No wait, let's talk about how awful today was. Today was a fucking mess.

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You see, I have a fucking 360. Well, many fucking 360s.

81
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
One of which was apparently going to be modded or J-tagged, if you will.

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And so I found some guy on Craigslist, which right there should have sent out some fucking signs.

83
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That would be willing to do it for me. So we arranged to meet this morning.

84
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So I drove a fucking hour and fifteen minutes down the Stockton, the butthole of the Sacramento County.

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Well actually it's San Joaquin County. Still butthole of the county.

86
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And so we went down there, and mind you...

87
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Actually, just to quantify. In the fucking state of California, you have fucking Fresno.

88
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Which I think is generally accepted as kind of like the asshole of the state of California.

89
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
No fucking offense to those that live there. Stockton would kind of be...

90
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's kind of like between the asshole and the balls. So Stockton is kind of the fucking taint of California.

91
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And there's nothing on the way.

92
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And it's not pleasurable.

93
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's just cow country. Fucking shitty smelling cow country.

94
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Anyways, so I decided... Okay, mind you, I woke up at 730 this morning.

95
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That's fucking early on a Sunday.

96
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I drove all the way down there. Met the guy just before 9.

97
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Gave him my console. Paid him the $60 it would be, you know, to solder in the chip that I wanted him to solder in.

98
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Told me it would take about, you know, fucking 30 to 45 minutes.

99
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Four hours later, waiting in fucking Stockton.

100
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
The guy's not returning any of my text messages. He's not returning any of my phone calls.

101
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And so I'm fucking sitting there going, okay, well, I guess I'm either going to fucking sit here all day,

102
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
or I'm going to have to fucking leave and leave my console behind and assume that I'm getting ripped off.

103
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So that's what happened. I got fucking ripped off apparently.

104
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Well, fuck him.

105
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yes, fuck him indeed. And so I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt for now.

106
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And assume that this really was a mistake and his phone is all fucked up or whatever.

107
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And so I will be polite and contact him by email, you know, giving him the opportunity to, you know, fucking ship me my console.

108
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
However, if he doesn't do that, then I'm fucking posting his phone number and posting his email.

109
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Hey, don't forget. Send me his IP. I will find his fucking address.

110
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
We can go show up at his house and say, fuck you. Give it back.

111
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So, anyways, and then Final Fantasy 13.

112
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
This is not the C-word show. Fuck you.

113
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And then Final Fantasy 13. That's, you know, basically been my gaming week.

114
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
By the way, Dark Soccer is just fucking openly swearing randomly at our fucking chat room.

115
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to join all the fucking action tonight in our chat room.

116
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yes, three hours of this tonight, ladies and fucking gentlemen. It could be this or the Oscars, I mean, honestly.

117
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And remember, keep track of how many fucks get fucking said so that we can fucking send it to fucking Guinness and fucking Ireland.

118
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

119
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Hey, stop trying to run up the counter artificially.

120
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That's not artificial.

121
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Fucking stop it.

122
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm legitimately saying fuck, and I can say fuck as much as I fucking want to, Rob, so fuck you.

123
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Oh, in a good way.

124
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Loki, any more in your fucking gaming room?

125
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Rob, I fucking love you.

126
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I fucking love you too, bitch.

127
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I also played some more of, oh, what the fuck, Borderlands.

128
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I played more of Borderlands because I'm trying to get the game finished before I can, you know, fucking start the new expansion.

129
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And I'm liking it still, and I just have to level up my characters.

130
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Actually, I have to level up my friend's character because he's fucking 18 levels below me.

131
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So, yeah, so I played a little bit more of that.

132
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And of course, Grand Theft Auto, you know, fucking, what, ranked like 74 now in the true skill ranks.

133
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And then I'm still fucking like 195 in the regular ranks just because I don't play on the weekends.

134
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And it's, you know, kind of bounces around during the week, so.

135
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
But true skill's really where I'm, you know, trying to get to the top of the fucking list.

136
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And doing pretty good. So, that's it.

137
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You notice how our chat room has been increasing exponentially?

138
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Oh, and fuck deft? Cunt.

139
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I said it. I hate that word, and I said it, so whatever.

140
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm looking at the chat, and all these fucking people are in there tonight.

141
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
We love you all, by the way. We fucking love you and your support so much.

142
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But we have Hardcore77777. That's a lot of fucking sevens.

143
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And his name there says, oh wow, I picked a bad night to listen.

144
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yes, you fucking picked a bad night.

145
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Welcome to your first fucking live show. Congratulations.

146
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
How was that?

147
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Isn't any week a fucking bad night to listen?

148
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Who was that?

149
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Hardcore77777777. Seven. Seven.

150
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And a fucking GP says, fucking GTA again? Fuck Loki, fuck.

151
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Hey, I believe that every fucking day. Twice fucking day.

152
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Actually, sometimes three fucking times a day.

153
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And I fuck everyone up in it, because I'm so fucking awesome.

154
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So, I have to. I have to mention it every week.

155
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's what I'm proud of.

156
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
In fact, and we'll get into this a little bit fucking later,

157
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
but remember how they updated some TOS stuff for Xbox Live?

158
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And now I can post my Ballad of Gay Tony ranks in there without, you know, the word gay being, you know, fucking banning me.

159
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Ah, well congratulations I suppose. There's a good reason.

160
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That whole policy was kind of fucked anyway. It was overcompensating.

161
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Is that a story later we're going to get into?

162
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I should probably shut my fucking mouth then.

163
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Anything else you want to talk about during your fucking gaming week?

164
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Just Final Fantasy's awesome.

165
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Alright, my fucking gaming week. I've been playing a lot of fucking WoW as usual.

166
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
My character's probably to about fucking level 53 I think I finally fucking dinged this week.

167
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Fucking addict.

168
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Shut the fuck up.

169
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Bite my fucking ass.

170
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
My boyfriend though, he got to level fucking 55, so he can roll a fucking Death Knight now whenever the fuck he wants.

171
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
But we might do like the twin Death Knight thing like fucking later, but I don't know.

172
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Like right now the fucking focus is getting his fucking character to 80.

173
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
But the problem is I found another game that's going to fucking sink all my time for the next two weeks, which I'll get into in a minute.

174
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But I wanted to talk about a couple of other fucking games real quick.

175
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
One of them is Critter Crunch. It's so fucking cute.

176
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And I finally played the full version of the game. I played the fucking demo before.

177
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's fucking cute. It's a lot like Magical Drop. Did you ever fucking play that?

178
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yeah, I played that. I didn't really care for it too much, but...

179
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Imagine if Magical Drop wasn't about matching the fucking colors, but it was about putting things in a fucking sequence.

180
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Like instead of like fucking all the blues disappear, it's like you got to go fucking green, red, and blue in an order or whatever.

181
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
That sounds too fucking complicated.

182
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
No, it's not that fucking bad because it's little bugs, fucking medium-sized bugs, and then big bugs.

183
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And it's pretty intuitive to figure out. It's not that fucking hard.

184
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And there's these weird elements too where you fucking barf rainbows into little critters' mouths and all these like overly cute fucking things.

185
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Well, no wonder you fucking like it. Barfing rainbows.

186
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Shut up. It's fucking cute. Shut up.

187
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And there's lots of modes in it. I wish I'd bought the fucking game when it was on sale, but it's okay because it's on Alan's PlayStation 3 so I can play it whenever the fuck I'm over there.

188
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
But it was really cute. I played through a good probably 15 stages while I was there and got some trophies.

189
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It's cute. I think it's a fucking good deal and if I wasn't so busy playing something else right now, I might fucking buy the full version.

190
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Who wants some fucking tequila?

191
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You have fucking tequila?

192
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You bought it.

193
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
If I didn't have to fucking drive home, I would.

194
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
We can do a shot now.

195
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
As if my swearing wasn't bad enough right now.

196
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Well, fuck it. It's a night just to fuck it. Do you want some tequila?

197
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I don't want any tequila.

198
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I better pass. I better pass. Thank you though.

199
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Fine. I'll drink my beer by myself.

200
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You fucking drink yourself into a coma.

201
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Alright, let's see.

202
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I play Misty too.

203
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Why is that?

204
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Just tell me about fucking beer.

205
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Um, let's see. What the fuck else is I playing?

206
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Oh, Final Fantasy II on the fucking iPhone.

207
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You kinda know what you're in for if you're gonna download a Final Fantasy game onto the fucking iPhone.

208
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Because the iPhone, although it is a gaming platform, it's kind of a fucking terrible one because there's no fucking controller.

209
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And that's the worst part about Final Fantasy II.

210
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I will say this. The game fucking looks great.

211
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It's fucking gorgeous. It's one of the best fucking looking games on the iPhone.

212
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It's a port of the fucking PSP one.

213
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It is. It's a fucking port of the PSP one, almost like tit for tat.

214
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
But, they have made some fucking adjustments to it to make it more touch friendly.

215
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
For instance, when you're in a battle, you have all these little fucking icons instead of the words to attack.

216
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And even when you're in the menus to cast fucking magic, there's these little fucking icons that show up that you use to cast your fucking spells and shit.

217
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And, you know, if you want to cast your spell on all the fucking enemies, you drag your finger to select all the enemies.

218
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You can't unfortunately just fucking sit there and hammer the A button to get through all the fucking battles.

219
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You know, you kind of have to tap tap tap tap, so everything's a little bit fucking slower.

220
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
That's not the annoying part. I don't fucking mind that as much as I do.

221
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,000
When you're in the fucking towns, and you're having to use the fucking fake D-pad on the touchscreen and the fucking button to run,

222
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And you're trying to talk to fucking townspeople, because the framerate is so fucking bad.

223
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And everything is so fucking jumpy that you literally have to chase all the fucking townspeople around for a fucking minute just to fucking talk to them.

224
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,840
to them which shouldn't be that fucking hard in a Final Fantasy game well they

225
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:21,280
don't fucking tell you that before you buy it so you won't know until you buy

226
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,540
it but I will say this nine dollars is a pretty fucking good price for Final

227
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,880
Fantasy 2 again I bought Final Fantasy 2 because I played the original fucking

228
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,840
Final Fantasy a ton of times so whatever but the Final Fantasy fucking 2 I only

229
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,440
played once on the PSP so I decided what the fuck I'll buy this just to kind of

230
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,720
check it out it's only nine dollars I will say this if you have a fucking PSP

231
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:45,000
just spend the extra ten dollars to get a copy of the Final Fantasy yeah you

232
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,800
could probably fucking find it used somewhere for cheaper so yeah if you're

233
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,920
gonna pay nine dollars for the fucking iPhone version did I say nukin is that a

234
00:15:54,920 --> 00:16:03,680
nukin nukin but it's fuck inga yeah thank you I know um if you're gonna

235
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,980
spend half as much to get the iPhone version then you fucking get what you

236
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,520
fucking pay for that's all I have to say when it comes to controls this kind of

237
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:15,200
weak sauce but it is a beautiful game and you know with being able to save

238
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:20,200
anywhere the fuck you want to it's a good game to just pass the time if

239
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,320
you're you know on the fucking potty or sitting at the fucking doctor's office

240
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,600
waiting for something it's it'll take you probably a year to fucking beat that

241
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:34,880
way but you can fucking do it so there you go um let's see other fucking gaming

242
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,200
news this week okay I'll tell you a game that's been taking a lot of my fucking

243
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:44,040
time Final Fantasy 13 I've sunk about five and a half hours into it so let me

244
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,680
give you my first impressions and I'm gonna step away from the f-word thing

245
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,880
for a minute because I I know a lot of people are really anticipating this game

246
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,560
so I want to talk seriously about this for a minute so Final Fantasy 13 is

247
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,280
obviously on its way out on Tuesday and we got a copy through legitimate

248
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,520
purposes don't you worry it's it's totally legit and all that stuff just a

249
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,240
few days early just so we could jump in there and have something to say about it

250
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:08,680
today it played through the game and you know I've read a lot of the reviews are

251
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:13,000
online just like a lot of you guys have about how the game is is really fucking

252
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,720
linear and you know it's kind of just an interactive movie where you're just

253
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,920
fucking bashing the X button for a long time and I kind of go well Final Fantasy

254
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:27,400
7 I see a lot of comparisons from 13 to 7 at least in the bits that I've played

255
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,640
so far you might remember in Final Fantasy 7 you started that game and you

256
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,920
were in Midgar and you were trapped there you know I shouldn't say trapped

257
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,760
it makes it sound like you couldn't do anything but you were playing a somewhat

258
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,920
linear story for about the first seven hours of Final Fantasy 7 until you

259
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,080
depending on you know how fast or slower you are you tell you get out of Midgar

260
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,960
and explore the overworld now I know an overworld well I don't I don't really

261
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,120
know what I haven't read spoilers on 13 and I don't want to know so chat stay

262
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,840
quiet I don't know if there's an overworld that shows up but I already

263
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,160
know there's no towns so I imagine it's gonna stay kind of very well they have

264
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,960
took over writing they have in the manual so obviously okay so so there's

265
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,280
gonna be some type of overworld later that's gonna be similar to seven in fact

266
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,440
honestly guys this game has a lot in common with seven there's a lot of the

267
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,080
same types of characters like lightning and cloud have a lot in common except

268
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,920
one's got a vagina there's you know the emo kid that you just want to slap

269
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,720
across the face there's your sassy black man that's there for comic relief I mean

270
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,320
there's a lot of similarities and but that isn't a bad thing I mean Final Fantasy

271
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,600
7 was a really good game it got overblown a little bit by the fucking

272
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:43,560
crazy-ass fans out there but it's it was still a good game 13 is kind of linear

273
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,080
in the beginning because you're running down a railroad track so yeah there's

274
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,740
not a lot of fucking places to go because you're supposed to be running in

275
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,100
a fucking straight line but I kind of consider that part of the very slow

276
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,080
learning curve of this game and I think that's what's gonna make or break people

277
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,780
consider that you don't learn about paradigm shifts which is this huge

278
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,440
fucking change to the battle system until you're three hours into the game

279
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:12,320
is that like x2 or 10 to um I think that's a lot of I mean Lost Odyssey kind

280
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,440
of had some of that too a lot of these are so it does remind me a lot of Lost

281
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,680
Odyssey actually mm-hmm but Lost Odyssey was more like you know Final Fantasy but

282
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,800
when I say it takes three hours to get there I don't want you thinking you're

283
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,160
just fucking bored for three hours just sitting there jerking off doing nothing

284
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,360
I kind of find this game to be like a like a banana or something that slowly

285
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,680
peels and slowly unfold it's our show its true shape and like if you don't I

286
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,420
don't know if you read any of the manual or anything like before you started like

287
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:47,280
like falsie and lost you know let's see and stuff like that I was like what the

288
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:53,520
fuck are they talking about turn subtitles on interjection just a fucking

289
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,840
interject I'm currently not listening to this because I haven't played it yet and

290
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,800
I'm trying to keep the spoiler for I'm not gonna get story but I'm and I want

291
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,600
to be completely surprised so I'm I will give little spoilers about the battle

292
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,920
system I am zoning the fuck out okay fucking zone out all you want sorry

293
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,440
lucky what we say no it is confusing and I do have the subtitles and stuff turned

294
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,040
on because you know I don't want to in the my audio whatever cuz I have the

295
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:22,520
five-one headphones or whatever it's very digital sounding it's like a lot of

296
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,660
like it's too loud almost like you're like I'm listening to it and at a

297
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:30,120
drive-in theater through one of those really shitty speakers is what it sounds

298
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,160
like well here's the thing they're talking to a lot of it starts to make

299
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,760
more sense as it goes on the way the storytelling is in this game again I'm

300
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,660
not gonna spoil the story itself but the way the storytelling is I draw a lot of

301
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:45,540
comparisons to the TV show lost or you kind of find things out slowly but

302
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:50,240
surely and then a lot is explained through flashbacks like the very opening

303
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,940
sequence of the game you're like oh this is just like Final Fantasy 7 people on a

304
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:58,120
fucking train all over again right but you find out the motivations and while

305
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,520
that happens through flashbacks that occur in the story so there's a lot of

306
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,800
similarities I think between like watching lost on TV but you know how

307
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,800
lost kind of divides people like some people are like I this this shows too

308
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,760
fucking slow for me they need to get to the fucking point already that's gonna

309
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,000
be what makes or breaks people if I'm has he 13 I think as well is that if

310
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,400
you're not willing to make that investment and kind of approach this is

311
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,800
like a miniseries or kind of you know something like lost like I don't see how

312
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,280
you could like a show like lost and then hate the way the story is in this game

313
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,760
because it takes fucking forever for things to happen in lost and it takes a

314
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,760
little while for things to happen in this game it's it's kind of the same I

315
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:39,080
want to speak really quickly about the battle system real quick okay Final

316
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,120
Fantasy and introduces this new thing called paradigm shifts and the easiest

317
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,260
fucking way I could explain it is that imagine you could flip your character

318
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,960
from a black white mage to a white mage right in the middle of battle that's

319
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,520
what the paradigm shifts are all about and it's a lot cooler than I think I'm

320
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,160
making it sound because like you know you might be doing a battle and you're

321
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,320
trying to chain things to get the monster to kind of slip into this mode

322
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,280
where it's easier to hit it and then all of a sudden you're like oh shit I'm low

323
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,720
on HP I better paradigm shift so I suddenly get a medic in my party and

324
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,080
also maybe somebody that casts barrier and all that shit to protect people and

325
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,640
then once everybody's cured up go back to assault yeah because you're really

326
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,040
fucking off you're really only controlling the first character in the

327
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,840
in each party so you're only controlling the party leader at the rest of them

328
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,800
you're kind of having to give like different jobs to and they basically do

329
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:30,280
it um going to our chat room at chat orange lounge radio.com Bo fuck you

330
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:36,160
which kawa says so it's fucking x2 it's a lot more fluid than x2 you know x2 had

331
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:40,240
those big big big animations with the dresh fears and everything it's a lot

332
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,000
quicker than that it's not so over the top like it was in x2 it feels a lot

333
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,520
more fluid I'm gonna say the battle system in 13 to me feels a little bit

334
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,960
more like an action game it takes active time battle to the next level it is like

335
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,320
fast paced it is very fucking and ever like you know much like the other final

336
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,560
fantasy games you know to get a preemptive strike or whatever is kind of

337
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,800
random whereas this you actually can sneak up on enemies because they have

338
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,680
like their own you know visual arc that they have their line of sight or

339
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,800
whatever and you can if you sneak up around them you can actually you know do

340
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,920
preemptive strikes that way and it works a little bit different to where you

341
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,040
don't necessarily do damage to them but it jumps that combo up so that you can

342
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,440
do more damage to them later on good good question really fucking great

343
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,520
question from yyr in chat says so does this mean you don't have to use any

344
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,760
strategy when choosing your party because you can swap at any time so far

345
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,780
and again granted I'm only five and a half hours in right now for those that

346
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:40,360
are playing the game I'm in a place called thing it's called the valley of

347
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,420
ruin is what it's called oh that's all I say I don't want to spoil stories or

348
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:48,440
whatever you don't have control over who's in your party people switch in and

349
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:53,840
out based on the story in fact there's a lot of these people are over here and

350
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,200
these people are over here these people are over here and their paths intersect

351
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,300
once in a while there's a lot of that going on early on in the game so you

352
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,300
don't really have a lot of control over your party. I think later on you'll be

353
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,700
able to control that more and also don't worry the way the XP works is very

354
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,980
similar to Ten's experience system where you're kind of moving around the board

355
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,560
spending points and... That was a little confusing too because I was trying to figure out

356
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,220
I was like trying because they're all yeah you pick the direction you want to

357
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,940
go and you hold this button down I'm like I want to go this way and it's

358
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,780
going the opposite direction I'm like no I want to go the other way it's all

359
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,060
right it makes it makes sense later on as you're using it it's very similar to

360
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:31,180
Ten's all your characters gain points when anyone in your party wins so it's

361
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,780
not like you're gonna have these obscenely under leveled characters

362
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:37,700
there are no levels for the characters there's there's no levels

363
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:42,020
there's no XP there's a but there you have kind of the Ten's system instead is

364
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:46,660
what you have in place of that there's no magic points which is a huge shift

365
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:51,620
there's something else they use instead of magic points but your characters are

366
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:56,180
gonna be flinging fire and arrow left and right with no consequence you have

367
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:00,660
to really think about that and there is um what else do I want to say there's no

368
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:06,020
magic and there's no oh and after every battle you're cured to full you don't

369
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:11,660
have to cure your party after battle you start heal everybody yeah it's a lot of

370
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:16,020
changes some people are not gonna like it but I say give it a chance I think

371
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:19,780
it's a lot of fucking fun and I'm five and a half hours in I am hooked hooked

372
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:24,540
hooked hooked I want to you guys know I have fucking gamer a DD really fucking

373
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:28,180
bad I'm always like ooh shiny I want to go play this fucking blur beta or I'm

374
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:31,340
gonna go play game room or something I will see this game out to completion I

375
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:37,540
will I know I will I think the story is actually pretty good yeah I like it but

376
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:44,140
if you really really hated the characters in seven you might hate these

377
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:49,100
guys too so just a word of caution because I see a lot of similarities and

378
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:53,780
I don't want to fall down the path of like the really nerdy you know gamer

379
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:58,380
that's you know virgin in his you know basement that's and stuff because we

380
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:02,700
know that's not really the truth of me fuck those stereotypes but here's what

381
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:09,420
I'm saying dude and I feel really wrong saying this but Vanille it's fucking hot

382
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:16,420
like it's like what the fuck 15 that is gross fucking pedophiles dream it's

383
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:20,940
seriously it's like it's like oh not to spoil anything where'd you get your

384
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:27,260
seal oh it's right here my upper thigh like oh come on yeah that was Alan and I

385
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:31,020
were both like just had that big reaction of oh I feel dirty oh oh god

386
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:37,100
that was dirty oh god what's up with her voice actor or actress I should say it's

387
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:44,300
just like got an accent and she's I don't even know what's wrong but it's

388
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:48,140
weird it's just seriously weird it's like oh the one thing and I'll wrap this

389
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,980
up because I know Jamie's like I want to talk about something else I was doing my

390
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:54,340
fucking laundry okay but well I just want to say this really quick one thing

391
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:58,020
that just blew me the fuck away when I was playing this game like seriously

392
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:01,700
it's the little things that count well two things a when you fucking load your

393
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:06,220
game after having taken an hour break or something you get a fucking explanation

394
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:09,300
of where you're at in the story so you can remember where the fuck you left off

395
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:14,060
which is great like just it's a lip it's little things that count also blew me

396
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:20,980
the fuck away you ready the lips are in sync with the English dialogue that's

397
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:26,180
right that it is not a really bad dub they did that with 10-2 though did they

398
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:29,940
I didn't play enough of 10-2 I watched some people also didn't really get in

399
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:34,880
mind that the ending cinemas actually a lot of the cinemas were re-synced to

400
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,060
also fit the English dialogue and the end sequence the little song that unit

401
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:44,620
gets up and sing was completely reanimated I was fucking blown away by

402
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:47,860
the like it's those little things that just made me go whoa and by the way

403
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:52,580
since it hasn't really been mentioned yet the game is fucking gorgeous it is a

404
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:56,840
beautiful beautiful game and I know I've seen those reports others say no the

405
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:02,820
360 version looks worse than the ps3 who cares play the fucking game I don't care

406
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:06,820
what system you get it on that we're getting the ps3 one and that's what I

407
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:12,620
got to but I was just I just knew the 360 was a port and I you know what I

408
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:19,460
just I wanted my achievement points did you go 360 yes I did I went 360 okay I

409
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:23,860
have is no no biggie as three discs and you know what though I mean honestly how

410
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:28,340
often am I gonna be shifting new discs around what whenever I get to that point

411
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:33,740
oh my god I have to put another disc in the machine I feel so old you'll be

412
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:38,300
amazed at how fucking much they probably squeezed onto one disc it it's just it's

413
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:44,700
a beautiful game it is so like I just blown away by some of the visuals and

414
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,580
like it's not all just like the industrial looks that you've seen in

415
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:52,220
the trailers and things it is a well fuck it was funny my friend you know

416
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,880
work he was like oh I don't know if this Final Fantasy is gonna be good or

417
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,820
whatever so we played you know I started playing the game and literally got five

418
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:03,540
minutes into it and it got that first action sequence that's in the train where

419
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,660
she's jumping off the fucking walls and shit he's like yeah this game's not

420

00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:03,380
who but we are going to see the movie this week I do want to see fucking Alice

458
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:06,260
in fucking Wonderland although I've heard it's kind of fucking mixed it's

459
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:09,940
fucking okay I have heard I have heard from someone who is a very big stickler

460
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:13,660
for Alice in Wonderland who said that she loved it no I was pissed the fuck

461
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:17,180
off though that they didn't have the Tron 2 trailer before it because we

462
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:21,420
didn't see the fucking 3d version well the 3d version was just not playing at

463
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:24,660
the right time and it's more expensive and I honestly don't think the fucking

464
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:28,460
3d was that good and you know Alice in Wonderland just based well you know what

465
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:31,980
I saw in the trailer by the way I neglected some of our chatters are

466
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,340
really fucking confused right now that we're suddenly talking about playing

467
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:38,780
the pink anus let me give some fucking background to that you first off listen

468
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:41,300
to last week's show it's all fucking explained there but there's a game on

469
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:45,580
Steam called what what the fuck is it secrets of the magic crystal and it's a

470
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:49,380
game that looks like you're breeding unicorns or some fucking bullshit but

471
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,780
one of the items that you're using if you look at the various screenshots one

472
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:56,260
of the items you use in your fucking horse breeding has these little pink

473
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:01,660
bars and they're called anus a en us so we officially have fucking called this

474
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:07,820
the pink anus game because it's funny and you get to say anus and you're not

475
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:12,620
being vulgar you're just talking about what's in a video game so there you

476
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:16,900
fucking go there's some explanation on what's going on all right um let's see

477
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,980
what other fucking housekeeping do I have fucking why aren't you fucking

478
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:24,340
following us on Twitter and Facebook and all that stuff twitter.com slash olr

479
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:27,300
we'll take your fucking Twitter questions later you know because it is

480
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:31,980
the show where every fucking gamer has a voice even when that voice is very vulgar

481
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:36,020
we also have our Facebook at orange lounge radio we have a myspace too but I

482
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,380
haven't logged in there for like fucking three months but I guess I should check

483
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:42,660
on that yeah I really should just go to the fucking website orange lounge radio

484
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:46,940
com it's great we got you know these two guys chase VX Jason XV and deep man

485
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,620
worked very fucking hard on the website by the way deep man speaking of the

486
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:53,820
website I need to fucking say this real quick fucking deep man posted a fucking

487
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:57,900
great little exposition on a game I don't know a fucking lot about but it's

488
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:01,420
Yakuza 3 I haven't really been fucking following this very closely because I

489
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:04,460
didn't really play Yakuza 1 or Yakuza 2 but I still found deep man's article

490
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:07,580
very fucking interesting because Sega made all these fucking localization

491
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:11,420
changes to Yakuza 3 that have people pissed off and I think deep man does a

492
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:14,500
very fucking good job of running it down and I'm also just kind of fucking

493

please makes it nice please makes it very fucking nice but here's the other

519
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:09,900
thing to keep in mind is that I bet anything there's gonna be one of those

520
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,660
fucking like podcasts that reviews other podcasts or something or some fucking

521
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:18,060
asshole on his blogs and say listen the orange lounge radio and all they did was

522
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:23,300
say fuck cuz they're just stupid and can't think of anything else to say

523
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:29,620
you other podcasts that seems like again waste again we are protesting the

524
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:36,180
anti-cussing week that our government has seen fit to waste fucking money and

525
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:41,260
time voting upon when we are in the middle of what we've hit budget crisis

526
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:45,780
besides the sides are fucking going out on the freeway and getting like

527
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,460
threatening to get fucking run over by cars in protest of how bad the fees have

528
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:54,020
gone to universities and I mean I'm a student myself and even going to junior

529
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:57,380
college right now is fucking expensive and come on look at how bad the fucking

530
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:01,540
universities are if these students think that that's a good idea running around

531
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:05,860
on the freeway didn't they fucking learn that and like preschool here's the thing

532
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:09,740
I think we should have a 60 star loving what I need the ol army and the people

533
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:13,340
that get it tonight you fucking cool kids that are understanding the show

534
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:18,380
tonight if you see this shit out there on the internet somewhere fucking tear

535
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:22,300
them a new asshole because honestly fucking independent people should be

536
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,620
supporting each other not tearing each other down I don't fucking talk bad

537
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:29,020
about independent podcast open fucking season on those that get paid to do it

538
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:34,180
in the core podcast though I will I will rip them apart but indie podcasts need

539
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:38,340
to fucking help each other out and if I may make my own statement about that and

540
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:42,660
this goes even on an individual basis usually when someone puts down somebody

541
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:46,100
else without giving any constructive feedback it's because they are having

542
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:51,820
issues with themselves low fucking self-esteem leads to bitchiness sorry

543
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:56,580
haven't you noticed that usually the people who are the loudest or certain

544
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:01,660
people who are um anti-gay I was just fucking that that happened in our

545
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:07,780
backyard at main national news right huge fucking anti-gay Republican no no

546
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:11,420
I shouldn't there are some cool Republicans believe it or not it's just

547
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,980
the wrong fucking people are in control of that party right now like Meghan

548
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:18,460
McCain I'm down with her she is a cool Republican but yeah idiots like this guy

549
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:23,220
who fucking voted you know yes on a and then fucking has all this legislation

550
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:27,740
it's fucking anti-gay gets caught at faces a gay bar the Jamie and I have

551
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:34,380
fucking gone to this place makes gay look straight I've been there coming

552
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:38,540
back from fucking faces with another guy in his car I mean anyway sorry we need

553
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:43,820
to go back and do karaoke at faces that would be a lot of fun I actually I

554
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:50,620
actually though did have another point with this is that you know it's not

555
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,940
really just the budget crisis that haven't we hit what is it somewhere

556
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:58,660
between 14 and 17 percent statewide unemployment so people there's no fucking

557
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:02,260
jobs out there yet instead of doing things you know to help people get jobs

558
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:09,140
to create new programs they're wasting their time and effort on safeguarding

559
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:15,460
morality which is an individual choice so to our government right now fuck you

560
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:20,460
in your ear because your ass is not good enough come some quick fucking comments

561
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:25,140
from chat hardcore 77 once note says both Republicans and Democrats are

562
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:29,060
corrupt I fucking agree with that honestly because the budget crisis we

563
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:32,060
have in the state right now it's everybody's fucking fault no I totally

564
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:34,660
agree you know I think part of the problem I got hate going back to the

565
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:38,780
political topic sorry it needs to be said it needs to be said the part of the

566
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:43,780
problem is that we are so stuck in this bipartisan you know system I mean I'm

567
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:47,980
sure if you ask anybody it's even on public sites to say America has a

568
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:52,420
two-party system that's a fucking lie we do have independent political parties

569
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:56,220
it's just the Democrats and the Republicans are the ones with the money

570
00:39:56,220 --> 00:40:01,220
to spend on it and the independence fall to the wayside you know it's the only

571
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:09,180
that is the reason why I wish that Perot had won I'm saying that is I get for

572
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:13,460
what for what he fucking stood for I get it I get for what he would do for the

573
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:18,180
I think morale I'd pick but okay he's the one I would have picked but I'm

574
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:25,820
saying that as an independent who came to me exactly you know four years vote

575
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:28,780
him out you know at least you know business won't be fucked up he's a

576
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:34,540
businessman but I'm saying that I would like to see the wall shattered I'd see

577
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:38,900
people break out of their little voting strict Republican because oh they're

578
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:44,180
Republican I want people to this is why I get an absentee balance every ballot

579
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:49,260
ballot every fucking year because I go through my ballot item by item look up

580
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:54,060
each of the people in the comfort of my home without having to waste time at the

581
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:57,500
booth or anything without people breathing down my neck and see who

582
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:01,660
everyone is and vote for somebody with a well-informed choice so I'm just saying

583
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:08,460
Oh full ticket okay I got I'm sorry that's okay it's a we fucking say

584
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:11,220
things that aren't fucking I mean this whole show tonight is not fucking

585
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:15,100
necessarily about video games but um where was I at also Oh liquid parrot in

586
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:19,300
chat I had a really fucking good comment what podcast is talking trash about my

587
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:25,220
beloved olr no one is yet it's just that I'm on Google alerts because I'm fucking

588
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,980
narcissistic right and I want to see everybody who's talking about orange

589
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,940
lounge radio no I don't I don't consider that narcissistic I just consider that

590
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:33,100
running a good business you want to know what's being said about you on the

591
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:37,260
internet and sometimes I'll see these fucking blogs from people writing their

592
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:41,700
individual blogs like podcasts I subscribe to and I unsubscribed from

593
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:45,700
orange lounge radio this week because I find them very annoying and the girl

594
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:49,780
talks too much and and the guy is too gay and the other guy is too angry and

595
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:55,300
blah blah like just shut the fuck up talk about a podcast you do like it

596
00:41:55,300 --> 00:42:00,220
nobody reads your fucking blog because you're so fucking negative that's the

597
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:05,980
thing anyhow but as far as far as I know the other podcasts are cool if somebody

598
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:10,980
is talking about us I don't know yet but if I find out it's fucking on all right

599
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:17,020
anyhow how about 45 minutes in the show and now some fucking gaming news right

600
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:24,220
Loki all right let's get into this um so there's this bug that fucking popped up

601
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:28,100
last week we thought it was you know maybe someone hacking the fucking

602
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,900
PlayStation Network or something like that which that still begs the question

603
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,020
what the hell was that web page then that said you know hey turn off your

604
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:39,940
turn on your fucking Java and your whatever so I don't know what that was

605
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:45,180
but anyways this was completely unrelated all apparently the most of the

606
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:50,260
fat PlayStation threes the old style ones had trouble connecting to the

607
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:56,140
PlayStation Network due to a bug in one of the arm chips and apparently this was

608
00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:01,220
caused by the PlayStation 3 thinking apparently that it was a leap year when

609
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:06,980
it wasn't and it became unsinked and so because of this you know date time you

610
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:12,180
know desynchronization it was unable to connect to the PlayStation Network as a

611
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:18,740
like a precaution the safety precaution or something anyways within you know a

612
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:23,260
little amount of time it was actually fixed basically the only advice they

613
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:27,340
fucking gave was don't turn your system on because you know you may lose your

614
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:32,100
trophies and you know you're some games you may not work in blah blah blah my

615
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:36,380
favorite was how when it was all fucking over they were like we fucking fixed it

616
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,260
it's okay to turn on your fucking PlayStations now and they didn't do a

617
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:43,880
goddamn thing they just waited it out that's all they did they didn't fucking

618
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:48,260
fix it they just it was it was a bug in the date and as soon as the date changed

619
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:54,700
all better so some somebody fucked up and thought 2010 was a leap year and

620
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,820
somehow that made it in the old fucking PlayStation here's here's my fucking

621
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:03,300
problem with that is apparently the those chips were actually the same chips

622
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:08,980
that were in the zooms and you may not remember the end of 2008 I think when a

623
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:13,540
switched over the end of the year they like fucking New Year's yeah it was like

624
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:17,860
New Year's and all the students stopped working because of the arm CPU chip and

625
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:21,300
apparently there's a date bug in that too and oh guess what the same chip was

626
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:26,020
actually inside you know the PlayStation 3 all along and it was a known problem

627
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:34,060
but they just kind of we forgot all about it you have fuck soon I don't

628
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:42,620
didn't well I don't have one anymore times get tough but yes I mean you know

629
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:46,980
you don't really want your whatever to stop working all of a sudden because oh

630
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:54,500
we didn't realize there's a bug in here and that's a problem I don't know and it

631
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,500
doesn't look good when your console stop fucking working the only advice they can

632
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:03,860
give you is don't play guess what Sony I was already not doing that or doing that

633
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:07,980
whatever I know don't play your ps3 for a day okay I can fucking do that that's

634
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:14,500
very easy so um what the what the fuck else is I gonna say about this oh here's

635
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:18,260
the thing yes Sony is is wearing a lot of fucking egg on their face for this

636
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:21,580
colossal fuck up and you know a lot of people are razzing them this week and

637
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:28,660
rightfully so but honestly is the red ring of death any fucking better I'd

638
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:34,020
rather have all the ps3s go down for a day and have it be all you know hunky

639
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:40,580
dory afterwards and have all the 360s go down permanently but but I will say this

640
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:44,580
it does kind of show that it's kind of fucked up that when something like this

641
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:48,300
happens I can't fucking play heavy rain or some of the other games that connect

642
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:52,700
to the network their needs it's very reminiscent of that very controversial

643
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:56,900
Ubisoft DRM that I know we're going to get into later in the show but it just

644
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:01,860
fucking strikes me as like a little hint of that and I do not like that do not

645
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:06,900
fucking want so there's a piece of me that's like Sony doesn't need to fucking

646
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:12,420
fix the date issue Sony needs to fucking fix the I can't play my games online if

647
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:16,100
something is broken on their end issue that's the fucking problem well here's

648
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:19,620
the other fucking thing that it's really bad is since they didn't really do

649
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:23,220
anything I mean is this actually gonna get passed out or like four years from

650
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:27,660
now are we gonna run in the same fucking problem again I will forget about it

651
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:32,940
it's okay oh yeah you remember that one time that all those ps3s went fucking

652
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:39,100
down yeah it's gonna happen again cuz it's not a leap year but try telling

653
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:48,340
that to the PlayStation it makes whatever year it wants fucking leap so

654
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:54,020
well is there a fucking possibility this is gonna happen in the future I don't

655
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,860
think it will be because they'll be probably patched out let's put it

656
00:46:56,860 --> 00:47:03,380
something to ignore it all right in other fucking Sony news we have news

657
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:06,380
about their fucking motion controller that's been kind of quiet ever since the

658
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:09,660
last e3 but I'm assuming that it's because they're gonna have some fucking

659
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:16,220
new news this year at e3 but the term PlayStation arc has been fucking

660
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:21,260
trademarked in Japan so you know we were calling the fucking ice cream cones that

661
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:26,020
light up as you wave them around like a freak apparently is gonna be called the

662
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:30,180
PlayStation arc which is not like these fucking new news because you know they

663
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,140
might remember there was a story earlier in the year where this fucking guy I

664
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:39,300
think at THQ had said the name earlier anyway so PlayStation arc sounds like

665
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:44,500
it's gonna be the fucking name but we'll see now also to kind of take that a step

666
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:49,340
further apparently Konami has a trademarked a game name and it's called

667
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:56,060
Gradius arc you know what I this is you know just me thinking out of my ass but

668
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:59,900
um you know what I think arc could stand for

669
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:07,300
augmentive reality controller oh look at you look at me my fucking acronyms yeah

670
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:12,220
yeah I mean there's only unintelligent people swear I like that I think you're

671
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:15,260
right I think fucking arc is an acronym for something I think that's a very

672
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:18,820
fucking realistic because all the stuff that they were showing in like their

673
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:23,420
demos were augmented reality demos either that or it's gonna be specific

674
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:30,020
for all arc the lad games I somehow really fucking doubt that or you'll

675
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:35,740
build a stick two of each animal into that controller shut up it will be the

676
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:40,820
controller how the fuck will that work playing fucking Gradius with a motion

677
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:44,140
controller do you fucking just flail around to move your fucking ship all

678
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:47,420
around and then pew pew pew with your button like I don't fucking understand

679
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:50,940
that how does how is Gradius gonna incorporate motion control that makes no

680
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:56,860
sense oh by the way Becky just alerted me to something what's that that um cuss

681
00:48:56,860 --> 00:49:02,980
free week did not pass the Senate no it was it was on the news and everything

682
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:09,980
oh I'll see if I can get her to send me a link maybe there's more well still

683
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:13,500
still it doesn't matter because it doesn't matter the fucking point still

684
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:18,140
stands whether it passed or not because they wasted their fucking time actually

685
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:22,100
voting on this it's even worse if it didn't fucking pass because they wasted

686
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:29,620
all the fucking time for fucking nothing so fuck them yeah any attack on my free

687
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:33,220
I don't know how you would fucking play Gradius though with a motion controller

688
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:38,380
the only thing I could think of is that maybe you control the options that way

689
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:43,420
or something I don't know me I flail around and knock the ships out of the

690
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:49,060
way it sounds dumb well name but the thing sounds dumb they also passed they

691
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:55,020
did pass California acupuncture day what the fuck I am not even gonna try to

692
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:59,500
dignify that one let's move on to another fucking news story dark Sakura

693
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:03,060
what the fuck you have for us well I have something and I actually just

694
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:10,940
posted pictures up on our fucking website there are ESRB listings for ps3

695
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:16,080
and PSP games there is alpha mission 2 baseball stars professional league

696
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:20,900
bowling and super sidekicks which are all neogeo titles to pop up on the PSN

697
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:26,700
so maybe we would see them and you know as soon as I saw the little capture

698
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:32,180
caption on the on destructoid I had to go grab my game and take a picture that

699
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:37,020
is a big fucking box for a video game it is god bless those games fucking stars

700
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:42,420
oh and by the way paid 48 bucks for it yikes yeah but keep in mind how much we

701
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:45,900
paid for fucking king of fighters 2000 that's true weren't those fucking games

702
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:51,460
like fucking $200 and they first we paid 350 for it but at the time all the

703
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:55,540
others were the other sites were selling it for about 400 so we got a really good

704
00:50:55,540 --> 00:51:03,140
fucking deal on it all right yeah um some some fucking clarifications in our

705
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:05,780
chat room because of course they the chat room gets all sicked on it and

706
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:10,540
everything it did fucking pass the assembly but it was rejected in the

707
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:15,300
Senate is there like a high crisis my point still stands it was a waste of

708
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:18,820
fucking time no matter what happened and that this was even allowed to get

709
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:22,680
somewhere and that people are fucking listening to this guy and you know what

710
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:26,060
they stand for and everything so point still stands and besides you all have

711
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:29,160
been one in the fucking fuck show for like a year and a half this is a good

712
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:32,100
fucking reason the jokes been running for like a year and a half so now is as

713
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:39,840
good of a time as any all right Loki yes so apparently there's been a whole lot

714
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:46,780
of drama going on with Activision this week earlier this week Activision had I

715
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:54,420
guess let go the two the two leads over at infinity Ward

716
00:51:54,420 --> 00:52:03,100
Vince Zappanella and Jason West and these two studio heads just all the

717
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:08,780
sudden aren't working there anymore and now more and more information you know

718
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:14,500
kind of came out about that and apparently it was according to a bunch

719
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:19,940
of lawsuits here because now they're filing lawsuits against Activision for

720
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:25,860
unpaid royalties apparently these guys you know they did all their hard work on

721
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:29,740
modern warfare 2 or whatever and Activision wanted them you know they're

722
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:34,660
kind of strong arming them into making you know the next modern warfare game or

723
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:39,220
whatever next you know war game take place in Vietnam and whatever the case

724
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:44,380
may be but to get out of paying them royalties they decided to go ahead and

725
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:51,580
let them go and so it's kind of interesting now of course they their

726
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:54,780
comments on it we were shocked by Activision's decision to terminate our

727
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:59,620
contracts we poured our heart and soul into that company building not only a

728
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:03,340
world-class development studio but assembling a team we've been proud to

729
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:07,700
work with for nearly a decade we think that the work we've done speaks for

730
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:12,460
itself and it says after all um all we have given Activision we shouldn't have

731
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:19,260
to sue to get paid and of course Activision you know responding to their

732
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:23,060
lawsuit they say that they're disappointed in the lawsuit and that

733
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:28,300
it's meritless says Activision is disappointed that mr. as Zamper Ella and

734
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:33,580
mr. West have chosen to file a lawsuit with and believes their claims are

735
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:37,500
meritless over eight years Activision shareholders provided these executives

736
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:41,700
with their capital they needed to start in Finney Ward so basically they say hey

737
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:46,540
we made you now we can break you as well as financial support resources and

738
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:49,860
creative independence that helped them flourish and achieve enormous

739
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:53,820
professional success and personal yes because if they didn't give them money

740
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:57,780
I'm sure that they couldn't create these wonderful games is what they're saying

741
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:02,980
you know granted that studios do need you know money to get going but I think

742
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:06,140
it's just a creative talent behind it that creates the games anyways I

743
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:10,060
continues in return Activision legitimately expected them to honor

744
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:14,460
their obligations to Activision just like any other executives who hold

745
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:18,700
positions and trust in the company while the company showed enormous patience it

746
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:22,220
firmly believes its decision was justified based on the courses of

747
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:29,220
conduct and act actions basically long story short they were unhappy with what

748
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:34,300
was going on with Activision and so they were the rumor is that they were kind of

749
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:37,840
shopping around elsewhere not the only ones that are kind of had their fucking

750
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,940
fill of Activision and that's for sure can I read this quick comment from chat

751
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:44,740
from odd fuck again the opinions in our chat room are not necessarily those of

752
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:48,180
us here on the show but here's odd fuck in our chat room Bobby Kotek needs to

753
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:51,180
die in a fucking fire with fucking fire ants on his face while everyone fucking

754
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:57,220
pisses on him might be a little bit extreme but but isn't tonight all about

755
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:02,080
extremes um here's the thing though I I kind of fucking believe this guy's days

756
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:06,400
this guy's days are numbered Activision has such a fucking bad rap right now

757
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:11,020
there has been just like this one two three four punch you have the fucking

758
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:15,940
king's quest game gets shut down you have the fucking all these subsidies of

759
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:19,180
Activision getting shut down all the stuff that's fucking going on now with

760
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:23,340
you know their biggest selling game I mean the Bobby Kotek is looks like a

761
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:28,120
fucking buffoon right now like if I were a shareholder I would be demanding some

762
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:33,020
fucking answers and calling for some fucking you know I I just think it's

763
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:37,820
they look stupid and unfortunately you know if infinity what it would comes

764
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:43,700
down to is if infinity ward ends up you know dissolving or whatever me though

765
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:47,900
let's move on to because they were before they were behind Medal of Honor

766
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:51,420
and stuff they were working on that series and they left to go form you know

767
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:56,700
this new company basically to you know create the Call of Duty series and the

768
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:00,740
Call of Duty series has been really awesome but you know if they're gonna be

769
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:04,420
treated like dicks I mean come on Activision's been so awful now that

770
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:08,900
they're making EA look fucking awesome I want to address some fucking good points

771
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:12,420
in chat shadow fucking runner says Robert they still making money and why

772
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:15,140
oh I are says Rob it doesn't matter people are still buying their products

773
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:18,620
in droves the shareholders demands results well hold on guys because all

774
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:21,740
this fucking stuff has come out like literally within the past couple weeks

775
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:24,340
and although we've kind of known Activision's I'm going down a shady

776
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:27,260
path for a while this whole one-two punch I'm talking about is just in the

777
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:32,060
past couple weeks so you're gonna I don't mean he's gonna fucking get you

778
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:37,380
know pulled from the board tomorrow but wait about six months to a year wait a

779
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:41,860
little while and see when that next modern warfare games comes out if it's

780
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:47,340
not fucking up to par it's over if guitar hero sucks it's over they're done

781
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:50,900
guitar hero is done for if the next fucking game sucks you know what I mean

782
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:55,060
wait for kind of you kind of have to wait to see how this all plays out but

783
00:56:55,060 --> 00:57:00,460
if some of these decisions lead to really bad things the holiday season

784
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:04,660
just look it will have a you how they treat their franchises I mean Call of

785
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:09,100
Duty they're putting out new ones every year I mean they're basically the whole

786
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:12,660
reason they even you know take on you know brutal legend that kind of stuff

787
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:17,340
and Ghostbusters well we can't figure out a way to pump out a new game every

788
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:22,500
year in this franchise so we're just not gonna take it and then same with guitar

789
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:26,260
hero I mean look how they're treating like download content stuff very little

790
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:32,140
each month and look at DJ here what Wow two download packs thanks thanks a lot

791
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:36,620
way to support it I will fucking say this though you do have a fucking point

792
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:39,780
that it's about the money they can do all the fucking dickhead things they

793
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:44,300
want in the world in the end it's about the money but my little but with that is

794
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:48,940
or my big but depending on whatever you want to look at it as don't

795
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:55,580
underestimate the the gamers and the kind of the impact that all that

796
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:59,780
negative press on all the blogs and shit can have I could be wrong and that's

797
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:03,420
fucking fine I think it's gonna come down unfortunately it's gonna fucking be

798
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:07,980
just like you know the protests or whatever what Call of Duty you know how

799
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:11,540
they're saying oh we're protesting this game we're not gonna fucking buy it yeah

800
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:15,900
and sure enough everyone's buying it you know or you know the Left 4 Dead thing

801
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:18,820
of course that's a different company but still you know remember fucking the

802
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:22,940
Left 4 Dead fucking thing on Steam that all the fucking people were playing

803
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:26,940
Left 4 Dead 2 where they got the screenshot yeah same same story so if

804
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:30,100
you really fucking mean it if you're really fucking you pissed off that these

805
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:34,580
guys got fired for all their hard work then you need to stop fucking buying the

806
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:38,700
games just stop don't buy the next Call of Duty game it's not gonna be an

807
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:43,260
infinity Ward game anyways I mean that's if you want to wait the way you want to

808
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:46,540
look at it I mean look at they're gonna put Treyarch and you know charge of it

809
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:51,020
and unfortunately Treyarch is just not as good as Infinity Ward I mean people

810
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:59,740
even know that I just I don't know just you know vote with your money all right

811
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:05,860
let's talk about some fucking titties how's that sound perk there's there's

812
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:10,340
one thing better than freedom of speech it's nudity and there's some titties to

813
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:14,860
be found in fucking heavy rain here's the deal I won't try to spoil the story

814
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:18,540
too bad but there is a love scene that happens at one point in the game you

815
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:21,100
know should be fucking obvious if you've seen some of the previous of the game

816
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:24,980
that it kind of pushed the envelope so there's a love scene now if you decline

817
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:30,780
the kiss and trigger the sequence anyway and reload your saved game right away

818
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:35,860
then you'll have the female lead running around titties flapping around

819
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:40,860
everything is all just hanging out so there you go you can run around and play

820
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:48,300
naked now of course the naked model was not made in the game to be run around

821
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:53,100
and play naked well but there's a shower scene that happens in the in the oh I saw

822
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:58,140
this what's interesting here here's the fucking part I think is interesting

823
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:00,780
though is that you know since everybody gets all fucking bent out of shape

824
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:04,820
because a nudity specifically the ESRB is this game gonna go back to the board

825
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:07,820
for an AO rating isn't this the same fucking thing that happened in oblivion

826
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:12,660
for the PC version ended up getting pulled and fucking rated AO because even

827
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:17,700
though you weren't supposed to be able to ever see the titties the titties were

828
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:23,580
there because they fucking would use them to base like a sheer top on I think

829
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:28,580
though that it's still okay because you actually do see that model in the game

830
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:32,060
it's just now that you're using that model for more than just that one scene

831
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:36,220
but isn't I mean for whatever reason I think it's fucking stupid but the the

832
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:39,820
fucks out there the rate things are like there's a big difference between a butt

833
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:44,580
and a pussy yeah but if they didn't all that is is 100 here's the thing if they

834
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:48,980
didn't if that model wasn't in the game if it was just like you know she's

835
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:51,980
behind a shower curtain or something like that and they're just using that

836
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:56,740
model or whatever for like a silhouette or something that's different but you

837
01:00:56,740 --> 01:01:00,600
actually use this model in the game for one of the scenes you actually see her

838
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:05,540
completely naked so it's just if they're gonna you know are you anything it's

839
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:10,340
gonna be fucking duration why didn't they just do like the Sims pixel thing

840
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:15,540
watch I miss fucking cleo right here watch next week on the fucking show

841
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:20,620
there's gonna be a story about some mother filing a fucking lawsuit against

842
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:25,660
because they fucking found this in the game because their kid read about this

843
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:29,500
on the internet on one of the gaming blogs so they fucking go in and unlock

844
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:32,720
the character and suddenly mom walks in and there's some fucking titties on the

845
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:36,060
screen and she fucking loses her shit not knowing that that's the game she

846
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:40,340
bought for her kid and there's a fucking lawsuit next week's show that'll be a

847
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:46,340
story if not next week two weeks but the bodies in the game already it would be

848
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:52,740
just the same badge and everything it would be just the same is if they he

849
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:58,460
didn't there's a lot or whatever and um you know nope no if they didn't do the

850
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:04,420
mod or whatever and just the shower scene it would be exactly the same I

851
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:08,660
hope you're right that there's no basis but I don't know her boobs don't move

852
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:12,220
like real boobs I have a feeling well I don't think you were ever supposed to be

853
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:15,600
able to just fucking walk her around and shit like that yeah uncanny valley my

854
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:23,420
ass I'm sorry that doesn't all look real we need some real looking titties we

855
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:28,500
need to we need team ninja to fix this yeah yeah range of motion in the face

856
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:34,460
but where is the range of motion in the fucking titties not rare dark soccer has

857
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:36,920
got a fucking new story for us then we'll get into some fucking release

858
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:43,540
dates yes fucking story happy fucking birthday PlayStation 2 dude I totally

859
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:50,420
want someone to make me a ps2 cake that'd be cool anyway um yeah ten years

860
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:58,500
ago ps2 launched in Japan yay um I have a Japanese ps2 me too I have the first

861
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:02,340
model one and it still works I bought mine I don't even know if mine still

862
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:05,000
fucking works I haven't touched it in years I bought it a little ways later I

863
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,500
bought it for beat me in a 2d x6 style because I was fucking addicted to 2d x

864
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:14,040
I think that's what we got ours for too and that and playing some of some of the

865
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:17,820
the few JRPGs that I had some of the fucking cool kids in town they had their

866
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:21,900
ps2 is for third and fourth style I didn't get on that train till about six

867
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:25,500
thousand and first they can beat me in a game the big thing that gets me on this

868
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:29,220
one is that there actually are people that still use their ps2 there's still

869
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:35,100
ps2 games being released so we're looking at a ten-year-old system it's

870
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:38,180
not funny that people never fucking believe that the PlayStation 3 has a

871
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:42,240
ten-year life cycle and people go that's too fucking long look at the ps2 it is

872
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:46,660
still fucking going after ten years yep yeah so a ten-year life cycle is very

873
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:51,740
valid at the end of its life cycle but yes it's so it needs to be put down you

874
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:56,700
know so a happy fucking birthday PlayStation 2 just just really fucking

875
01:03:56,700 --> 01:04:00,700

876
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:05,580
of the important PlayStation 2 moments for you that like had an impact on

877
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:10,000
gaming for you you know like as a Final Fantasy fanboy I think playing fucking

878
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,340
Final Fantasy 10 for the first time was a huge moment for me I know about you

879

890
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:23,060
that I beat everything in fourth cells it was third style I didn't because I

chat on orange on twitter.com yyr says boo ps2 boo I still dislike you because

897
01:05:56,420 --> 01:06:00,500
those of all the people who didn't buy or develop for the Dreamcast because

898
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:05,140
they were waiting for you fucking Charan says play shadow of the

899
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:11,180
fucking Colossus that was a pretty epic game too very fucking epic all right

900
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:14,180
well happy fucking birthday ps2 and for those of you still playing the ps2 you

901
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:18,140
might want to think about upgrading although I will say I do hope that the

902
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:21,400
fucking backwards compatibility comes to the PlayStation 3 at some point and I

903
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:26,300
know this is a big fucking wrap around I don't want to dread dirt mine has it I

904
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:30,460
know some of the old-ass systems do but by the time those systems break they're

905
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:35,220
gonna want to put out on the fucking marketplace ps2 games for download we

906
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:39,100
all know it's coming it's just a matter of when but the reason why I said put

907
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:43,060
out the reason why I somewhat welcome it I'm a little iffy on it I want to go

908
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:46,020
back and play Final Fantasy 12 again without having to hook up my ps2 you

909
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:48,660
want to know how many times I guess I would pay $20 to know how many

910
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:52,420
PlayStation 2 games I've played in my ps3 that's fully backwards compatible

911
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:57,980

938
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:22,340
compilation on PC and we case you didn't buy them all separately calling on the

941
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:44,580
art with almost Silent Hill and it looks Silent Hill ish maybe but it's not

942
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:51,340
photo showdown for the DSI it's right DSI not DS it's a game sort of like

943
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:56,380
monster rancher except you use the pictures that you take with your DSI

944
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:59,420
camera and based on the colors that are in there it creates different monsters

945
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:03,900
not quite as cool as you know putting random CDs in your PlayStation 2 or

946
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:08,740
barcode scanner or the barcode scanner yes that's true we need to bring back

it's not supposed to be out yet right yeah people are complaining about not

949
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:26,660
being able to play it I'm thinking that that dates wrong it must be out on steam

950
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:30,540
or something you know the box versions coming out this week also racket sports

951

coming out on the Wii it's Ubisoft's answer to Wii sports and it features all

952
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:39,780
different games you can play with rackets and they also have support for

953
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:45,060
the stupid camera that came with you self fitness because you know all those

954
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:50,060
games that use cameras for motion capture have been so awesome so far

955
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:55,420
granted the tall and you know the arc might be good but so far they sucked

956
01:10:55,420 --> 01:11:00,940
yeah they're in game for girls it's a girly game where you play a little girl

957
01:11:00,940 --> 01:11:06,780
minigames yay fun like pillow fights and braiding each other's hair something like

958
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:14,780
that count me out Yakuza 3 coming out on PlayStation 3 and this of course is a

959
01:11:14,780 --> 01:11:17,980
game that's getting lots of controversy for stuff that they've localized and

960
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:25,140
removed apparently people like their Japanese trivia and bar hostesses and

961
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:31,860
then of course later on this week blaze blue calamity trigger coming to PSP

962

multi-hit combos though and some of the sequences some really kind of pretty

1001
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:39,540
looking DVD ish style cutscenes and a very anime style looks like although

1002
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:43,380
it's RPG it might be a little bit action-based in its battles there you

1003
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:50,500

1009
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:17,780
to fucking remind everybody that is not part of the deal because the game makes

1010
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:23,460
sense on a PSP because there's no camera peripheral all right and on the Nintendo

1011
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:30,800

heavy so you're gonna have to I know your Japanese if you want to fucking

1015
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:44,820
play this game or you're gonna need to bake somebody to localize it enter brain

1017
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:52,380
here by the way although it's technically next week I should point out

1018
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:56,300
the DS releases are thinning out a little bit because next week is Pokemon

1019
01:15:56,300 --> 01:16:00,060
heart gold and soul silver are on their way on the Nintendo DS we know everybody

1025
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:37,300
that's all that there is all right some more fucking news than the classic game

1026
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:40,660
of the week everybody fucking loves the classic game of the week and I'm sure

1027
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:44,220
Dark Sakura picked a pretty fucking good one this week she usually does but just

1028
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:48,060
a few more stories before we get there I know you could all use a break to wash

1029
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:54,300
your mouths out with soap there's been some interesting fucking updates to the

1030
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:58,700
game portal this week they had a couple updates did you see the cover of Game

1031
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:05,660
Informer yes it did hmm jumping ahead of me here that's right so the first update

1032
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:12,500
that was out there was a patch that added some more radio dialogue I guess

1033
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:18,780
and there was some different messages that were in Morse code also some

1034
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:24,620
encoded messages with the numbers and equations in them and this was all part

1035
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:28,980
of like the radio that you would hear you know every now and then I think it

1036
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:33,780
was also in the room that you started off in and it was all kind of hinting

1037
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:38,300
different things now the people that looked at those images or whatever that

1038
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:45,980
was in the little radio messages it's kind of funny they actually found a

1039
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:54,180
phone number for a BBS you know those old things prior to the internet fucking

1040
01:17:54,180 --> 01:18:01,740
loved BBS's do yes you can't fucking trade wars 2002 what or was it 2020 I

1041
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:05,060
don't remember but you know all those fucking games were amazing but I should

1042
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:09,000
have the red fucking dragon enough said and then on of course those BBS's they

1043
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:15,180
found you know ASCII art featuring some stuff looks like different robots and

1044
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:22,180
whatever from possibly portal to very interesting looking some apparently this

1045
01:18:22,180 --> 01:18:27,740
is going to be some sort of ARG type of thing so that'll be kind of neat and

1046
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:31,740
then I just realized not all our chatters know what a BBS is God I feel

1047
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:35,940
old I'm really fucking sorry for not explaining it but BBS's ok back before

1048
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:39,220
there was the internet or if you want to get technical the internet existed them

1049
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:42,980
but it was only for fucking government people and stuff so back when like I was

1050
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:46,380
in fucking high school and probably about the time with the board system

1051
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:50,580
is you would have to dial in with a modem some guy would fucking hosted on

1052
01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:54,580
their computer or gal and you would dial in on your modem and connect to it and

1053
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:57,380
then it was kind of like it had forums and a lot of the stuff that you kind of

1054
01:18:57,380 --> 01:19:02,980
see in a new forum on the internet today but you know is a very community type of

1055
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:05,700
thing you didn't usually talk to people because you know people didn't want to

1056
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:08,180
call long distance and run up their phone bill so it's a very local thing

1057
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:12,180
usually yeah like I mean back in the day we have this free publication that was

1058
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:16,860
around called California computer news I fucking remember that man BBS's in the

1059
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:21,020
back BBS was seen in the back yeah you can you dial up I mean this is back in

1060
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:25,500
the day was ZZT and I download ZZT and I mean this is back also in the day when

1061
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:30,460
you know they had shareware which is you know kind of like you will take you 45

1062
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:34,260
minutes to download the fucking Wolfenstein 3d like a demo you know for

1063
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:37,260
a game not really even a demo for game but it'd be like the first episode for a

1064
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:41,220
game would be like about five bucks or whatever you would go you know buy a

1065
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:44,980
floppy disk from you know whatever retailer and you would have the first

1066
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:48,420
it'd be a full game but it wouldn't be like the full full game you'd actually

1067
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:51,940
go buy a new retail game but give you a really good idea what the game is like

1068
01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:57,020
and you could go on these servers and sometimes they would host the full

1069
01:19:57,020 --> 01:20:00,420
version of the game and you could download it for free or like you know I

1070
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:05,540
would download you know back before mp3s you know mod files and stuff like that

1071
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:12,460
you know different electronica you synthesize Amiga music files and stuff

1072
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:16,740
like that so they would have you all sorts of stuff and I remember actually

1073
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:21,940
the first time that there was mp3s I was like holy shit was an mp3 so that's kind

1074
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:25,020
of cool but yeah back in the day you used to go in there and you could

1075
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:29,020
sometimes it also have it where you could host like you know multiplayer

1076
01:20:29,020 --> 01:20:34,460
doom games online stuff like that I remember that into online this was you

1077
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:40,580
know back in the day with you this was all that we had it was not the internet

1078
01:20:40,580 --> 01:20:44,300
it was like which bbs can you get into and you know what cool files that they

1079
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:48,540
have on there and you know I had to download them in the Y protocol or the

1080
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:53,300
Z protocol X protocol yeah most people don't know the hell I'm talking about

1081
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:58,260
as ways you download stuff it wasn't as easy as click a file and it downloads

1082
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:03,180
speaking of mod files because I apparently perked some years up in chat

1083
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:07,260
there was an epic fucking gauntlet theme mod that was out there on the internet

1084
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:10,380
was like one of my favorite mod files ever it was the music files I don't know

1085
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:14,980
what mod stand for music something something but I believe it was want to

1086
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:19,020
see what mode tracks it was Commodore based but you know the PC had a lot of

1087
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:22,980
support for it too they had like s3m which is like scream tracker there

1088
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:27,860
basically it's it's tracker things like it was like MIDI where the MIDI you

1089
01:21:27,860 --> 01:21:33,500
trigger your different instruments that are hard coded into your graphics you're

1090
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:39,100
not graphics or your sound card well mods what they were is it was basically

1091
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:42,740
different sample files like WAV files that you put in there and it was

1092
01:21:42,740 --> 01:21:46,300
triggered like MIDI was so you would have like new people could record their

1093
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:49,980
voice record like actual guitars and stuff like that and it would be

1094
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:53,620
triggered and you could create new electrical music or electronic music

1095
01:21:53,620 --> 01:21:58,340
with that alright anything else you want to say about portal before we go to the

1096
01:21:58,340 --> 01:22:02,060
next anyways yeah so they get back in the portal yeah there's some pretty cool

1097
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:08,860
stuff coming out they also added an extended ending to portal which kind of

1098
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:14,260
made it creepy you may remember if you finish the game a lot of people have you

1099
01:22:14,260 --> 01:22:19,780
end up kind of at outside while you know the whole lab kind of falls out of the

1100
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:24,980
sky because it exploded well this extra ending that they've added 15 seconds

1101
01:22:24,980 --> 01:22:32,100
it's all thank you for you know you know thank you for going into like was at the

1102
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:41,060
escort posture whatever escort position yeah the further your party yes well yes

1103
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:44,900
escort party position or something like that and you you're getting like dragged

1104
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:50,300
away by your head it's kind of crazy very creepy but like all hinting towards

1105
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:53,460
portal to which they already did announce that there's gonna be a portal

1106
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:58,100
to I believe and if they haven't well well there's big fucking done of course

1107
01:22:58,100 --> 01:23:02,860
portal to me it was the best fucking game that came out that year you know

1108
01:23:02,860 --> 01:23:07,400
yes of course is gonna be one and of course it was already confirmed by Game

1109
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:12,660
Informer their cover is actually portal to and it shows kind of looks like

1110
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:16,620
after science was just like all these vines and stuff growing from the outside

1111
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:19,860
you kind of in through portals and stuff like that what's going to be kind of

1112
01:23:19,860 --> 01:23:24,100
unique about it the game will be coming out on a PlayStation or not PlayStation

1113
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:33,140
PC Xbox 360 and Mac platforms and it will be two-player co-op and it's gonna

1114
01:23:33,140 --> 01:23:36,740
have it's gonna be a lot of fun interesting looking things in there so

1115
01:23:36,740 --> 01:23:41,100
nice right if you want to learn more about that of course check out the

1116
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:45,380
latest game for one other first-person shooter news if you still can't fucking

1117
01:23:45,380 --> 01:23:49,540
tear yourself away from Halo 2 you know how much time left it's still coming

1118
01:23:49,540 --> 01:23:54,540
April 15th sorry guys your attempts to try and fucking change their mind

1119
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:58,380
haven't worked because they are shutting it down April 15th but Microsoft is

1120
01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:01,620
being really fucking nice and extending an olive branch to those of you clinging

1121
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:05,420
to Halo 2 if you are still clinging to Halo 2 you might want to check your

1122
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:11,940
inbox because Microsoft might have offered you a beta test for Halo reach

1123
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:18,020
three months of Xbox Live Gold and 400 Microsoft points now if you think oh

1124
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:21,820
shit I should run online and play Halo 2 real quick sorry you're probably not

1125
01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:25,220
going to get it now they probably did it for people that had played you know X

1126
01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:29,700
number of hours in the past month but still kind of pretty fucking cool

1127
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:32,940
Microsoft to do I suppose it's better than what they're required to do which

1128
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:36,860
is nothing so I'm sure there's a lot of people that are going to be fucking

1129
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:41,260
happy that they can get some bonuses there if they're not too fucking pissed

1130
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:47,180
off about Halo 2 going away so there you go what would be really fucking nice of

1131
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:50,500
Microsoft to do would be to just say you know if you want to run your own private

1132
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:54,220
servers here you go but I guess you can't really do that on the Xbox 360 and

1133
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:59,220
Halo 2 is not going away on the PC something to remember so if you really

1134
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:03,220
want to cling cling to your halo 2 for dear life remember you can't always play

1135
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:08,420
on the PC speaking of clinging to things for dear life dark Sakura every week

1136
01:25:08,420 --> 01:25:11,380
likes to jump into the fucking vault and pull out some really fucking old and

1137
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:15,900
moldy game that she says you know what you should be playing this game this

1138
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:22,200
week so it's the classic fucking game of the week dark Sakura what game did you

1139
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:27,620
pick this week for the kids I picked fucking Contra I haven't done it yet

1140
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:35,820
figured why the fuck not in Europe it was called Gris or and it was put up by

1141
01:25:35,820 --> 01:25:40,300
Konami it was originally on the arcade and came out for the NES which for the

1142
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:46,380
PAL region came out as probotector excuse me I burped on the mic um and it

1143
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:50,340
also came out for the MSX 2 and they're a bunch of sequels because I mean who

1144
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:56,140
doesn't remember Super C right um so basically you were these guys called

1145
01:25:56,140 --> 01:26:01,820
Bill and Lance who work for a red falcon and are trying to stop an alien invasion

1146
01:26:01,820 --> 01:26:05,500
and Bill and Lance like to run around with those shirts on and carrying big

1147
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:12,020
guns they wear vests Rob that's not the game and and head and we're headbands

1148
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:20,380
they do I can't help it if it's not about fucking um so yeah you can get a

1149
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:24,580
bunch of different um guns you get a machine gun laser gun a fire gun a

1150
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:31,380
spread gun rapid firepower up all kinds of different fun stuff and then you also

1151
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:37,060
besides having the typical side scrolling levels you also have a behind

1152
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:42,500
the back sort of 3d maze level where you have to go in a certain order and shoot

1153
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:47,540
go through the bases defenses and get to the end and it's really fucking hard I

1154
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:51,700
mean seriously it's hard if you don't use the Konami code and have somebody

1155
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:57,700
else playing with you and you can beat this game without dying I I want to meet

1156
01:26:57,700 --> 01:27:02,500
you and have you like sign my arm or something why why are in chat is trying

1157
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:07,620
to show off his big fucking skills sand cleared both Contra and Super C on NES

1158
01:27:07,620 --> 01:27:11,260
without 10 or 30 lives and without continues who else yeah but did you die

1159
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:16,220
I want to meet the person who can do it without dying can't Dan do it without

1160
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:20,660
dying mmm no actually on it fucking thought he could I thought that's why

1161
01:27:20,660 --> 01:27:24,700
you fucking married him no it was our type that he could beat without ah got

1162
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:30,940
you but also came out on this ZX spectrum Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC by

1163
01:27:30,940 --> 01:27:35,540
the way I need to ask you about Commodore 64 stuff Rob I fucking love

1164
01:27:35,540 --> 01:27:39,620
the Commodore 64 you have a good emulator ah I haven't used one in a long

1165
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:43,900
time I'm hoping the game room is gonna bring back some of the C64 stuff it's

1166
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:49,900
because we've done a pretty shitty job it's for someone else okay um but yeah

1167
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:55,660
they all came those versions all came out in Europe in 1988 the piece the IBM

1168
01:27:55,660 --> 01:28:01,620
PC version was also out in Germany the Commodore 64 and IBM versions later came

1169
01:28:01,620 --> 01:28:09,700
out in North America as Contra but yeah the the NES version was evil and hard

1170
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:16,100
and it was one of the earliest games to use the Konami code which one of the

1171
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:21,980
other games that did it was you know before that was of course Gradius and

1172
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:32,020
for the Falmicon it used a multi memory controller that Konami made for of

1173
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:35,460
course the Japanese market that gave it additional graphical effects so I don't

1174
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:38,380
know if anyone's ever played ROM of this but if you play the Japanese ROM the

1175
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:42,820
um there's animation in the background and other stuff going on the leaves are

1176
01:28:42,820 --> 01:28:49,260
moving and the grass is blowing in the wind and all kinds of fun stuff and it

1177
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:54,660
also had extra cheat codes like a stage select and a sound test and hidden post

1178
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:58,340
credits scene that you would hold select and start before and during the entire

1179
01:28:58,340 --> 01:29:03,420
end credits and yeah like I said the European version was called Pro

1180
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:08,260
Protector and the main guys were turned into robots and it was just because of

1181
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:14,900
censorship laws in the day fuck censorship but when Contra legacy of war

1182
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:21,760
and shattered soldier came out they retained the Contra name msx2 was

1183
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:25,460
actually fairly different than the arcade and the NES version because of

1184
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:30,660
limitations in the hardware it didn't scroll but it used flip screens sort of

1185
01:29:30,660 --> 01:29:35,140
the way that Metal Gear and Vampire Killer did and it was only single-player

1186
01:29:35,140 --> 01:29:42,900
however it did have it did change the last ten stages of the game and the

1187
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:48,100
msx2 version of Contra is on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan came out on

1188
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:53,020
February 2nd of this year of course there was a ps2 re-release version for

1189
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:57,820
Xbox Live arcade digital eclipse handled the conversion there's Konami classics

1190
01:29:57,820 --> 01:30:05,540
series arcade hits for the DS blah blah blah blah blah and you can actually get

1191
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:08,820
the Konami's collector series Castlevania and Contra for Windows in

1192
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:14,540
North America which also includes Super C and three Castlevania games and if you

1193
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:21,780
get Contra IV Contra and Super C on is also included as the DS so yeah pretty

1194
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:27,540
pretty freaking hard and of course there were a ton of Contra games came after

1195
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:34,900
there was a Super Contra well Super C well it was Super Contra overseas it was

1197
01:30:41,420 --> 01:30:46,060
Contra Force furnace Contra hardcore which that's really actually kind of

1198
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:53,900
hard to on Genesis Konami I love the Super Nintendo one that was awesome

1199
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:58,980
Konami contracted out for PlayStation Contra Legacy of War which also came out

1203
01:31:17,820 --> 01:31:21,900
music for Shattered Soldier Soldier if I remember right yes he did and also if

1204
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:24,300
you were looking for any of the soundtracks from the arcade version of

01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:29,220
Contra the soundtrack is included on Konami game music volume for Ajax which

1206
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:34,700

1207
01:31:34,700 --> 01:31:42,180
old yeah so yeah Contra all right like yeah great choice and the chat rooms

very fucking pleased with that Contra is your classic game of the week also I

1209
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:52,380
totally recommend watching the angry Nintendo nerd or angry gamer nerd his

1210

review of Contra it's freaking hilarious all right we're gonna take a quick

1211
01:31:57,140 --> 01:32:01,100
fucking break we'll be back with more of orange lounge radio in just a little bit

1212
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:16,580
so fucking don't go anywhere we'll be right back

1213
01:32:16,580 --> 01:32:21,020
perhaps one of the most interesting words in the English language today is

1214
01:32:21,020 --> 01:32:27,180
the word fuck out of all of the English words that begin with a letter F fuck is

1215
01:32:27,180 --> 01:32:33,620
the only word that is referred to as the f-word it's the one magical word just by

1216
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:40,340
its sound can describe pain pleasure hate and love fuck as most words in the

1217
01:32:40,340 --> 01:32:45,060
English language is derived from German the word frickin which means to strike

1218
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:50,940
in English fuck falls into many grammatical categories as a transitive

1219
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:58,380
verb for instance John fucked Shirley as an intransitive verb surely fucks its

1220
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:02,740
meanings not always sexual it can be used as an adjective such as John's

1221
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:09,980
doing all the fucking work as part of an adverb surely talks to fucking much as

1222
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:17,260
an adverb enhancing an adjective surely is fucking beautiful as a noun I don't

1223
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:23,260
give a fuck that's part of a word abso fucking lutely or in fucking credible

1224
01:33:23,260 --> 01:33:29,900
and as almost every word in a sentence fuck the fucking fuckers as you must

1225
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:34,340
realize there aren't too many words with the versatility of fuck as in these

1226
01:33:34,340 --> 01:33:40,300
examples describing situations such as fraud I got fucked at the used car lot

1227
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:48,780
dismay off fuck it trouble I guess I'm really fucked now aggression don't fuck

1228
01:33:48,780 --> 01:33:54,060
with me buddy difficulty I don't understand this fucking question

1229
01:33:54,060 --> 01:34:00,100
inquiry who the fuck was that dissatisfaction I don't like what the

1230
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:07,420
fuck is going on here incompetence he's a fuck-off dismissal why don't you go

1231
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:12,180
outside and play hide and go fuck yourself I'm sure you can think of many

1232
01:34:12,180 --> 01:34:17,100
more examples with all of these multi-purpose applications how can

1233
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:23,540
anyone be offended when you use the word we say use this unique flexible word

1234
01:34:23,540 --> 01:34:28,060
more often than your daily speech it will identify the quality of your

1235
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:39,780
character immediately say it loudly and proudly fuck you welcome back to orange

1236

only thing it was nominated for but that is the first win for a Star Trek movie

1264
01:36:49,580 --> 01:36:54,660
oh I didn't know that I thought even fucking nemesis got nominated at least

1265
01:36:54,660 --> 01:36:59,220
for like visual effects like I said the first win I see um but actually I do

1266
01:36:59,220 --> 01:37:04,500
have to agree that avatar did deserve best cinematography what the fuck ever

1267
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:10,540
let's get some fucking video game news Loki yes let's talk about some fucking

1268
01:37:10,540 --> 01:37:15,980
sequels including scribble knots to that's right coming from the fucking

1269
01:37:15,980 --> 01:37:20,700
source for Nintendo news Nintendo fucking power there will be another

1270
01:37:20,700 --> 01:37:23,980
scribble that's game and how can they fucking put another one you may ask

1271
01:37:23,980 --> 01:37:26,980
because there are so many words that were in there before because the first

1272
01:37:26,980 --> 01:37:31,660
fucking game sold like fucking hotcakes and it was a huge DS game well here's

1273
01:37:31,660 --> 01:37:35,980
how they're gonna fucking do it they're gonna add 10,000 more words that's right

1274
01:37:35,980 --> 01:37:44,140
10,000 words that's fucking more than 9,000 that's over 9,000 words just

1275
01:37:44,140 --> 01:37:48,540
giving me they were missing fucking 9,000 words apparently gonna be all

1276
01:37:48,540 --> 01:37:53,720
internet me me's this time I don't know but apparently adjectives will play a

1277
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:58,660
big role this time like you guys summon super Einstein or electric werewolf

1278
01:37:58,660 --> 01:38:06,780
mmm surprising versus electric werewolf I like that baby Cthulhu baby Cthulhu

1279
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:12,100
fuck yeah the shit out of me anyways it'll deliver apparently a hundred over

1280
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:20,220
9,000 yes over 9,000 deliver 120 new levels a level editor a new hint system

1281
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:25,220
and improved controls well better have improved controls because those

1282
01:38:25,220 --> 01:38:33,180
controls so how about actual controls first another not too surprising sequel

1283
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:37,220
in fact I've known about this for a little bit so calm for being announced

1284
01:38:37,220 --> 01:38:42,980
for PlayStation 3 by zipper the company developed it the last time around for so

1285
01:38:42,980 --> 01:38:46,780
calm confrontation but this is an actual sequel this time and apparently it's

1286
01:38:46,780 --> 01:38:54,300
going to deliver 14 missions with about 12 hours of gameplay and of course you

1287
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:58,500
know the developer has a pretty good track record when it comes to

1288
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:03,420
multiplayer games seen as they were behind mag which had 256 players however

1289
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:11,940
the game will only have 32 player online multiplayer and then this is great

1290
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:19,620
apparently at the 11th hour Ubisoft has made some emergency changes to their DRM

1291
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:25,140
on their PC titles apparently great topic for the fuck show apparently there

1292
01:39:25,140 --> 01:39:32,300
was there was some fixes that needed to be make because people were figuring out

1293
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:39,780
how to crack it and of course they've already cracked it but Ubisoft says that

1294
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:44,820
players should live should players lose their internet connection a requirement

1295
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:49,540
under the company's ridiculous new DRM scheme their single-player offline game

1296
01:39:49,540 --> 01:39:54,700
would drop upon reloading you be left with your last checkpoint and not the

1297
01:39:54,700 --> 01:40:00,900
actual point you were cut out now their claim is that no the you know the DRM

1298
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:06,420
has not been broken in fact those who are playing the cracked version out

1299
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:10,380
there aren't getting the full game experience and the words are not gain

1300
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:17,500
access to the you play stuff which no one gives a shit and to kind of go along

1301
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:22,740
with this in kind of the worst-case scenario situation well the worst-case

1302
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:27,260
scenario situation happened and apparently their servers went offline

1303
01:40:27,260 --> 01:40:32,380
their Ubisoft DRM often to kid authentication servers they've been down

1304
01:40:32,380 --> 01:40:38,220
and guess what apparently people that had Assassin's Creed 2 can't play it

1305
01:40:38,220 --> 01:40:44,780
right now dole and I smell a fucking class-action lawsuit and apparently yes

1306
01:40:44,780 --> 01:40:49,140
and it's been down for quite a long time and you know there's been people trying

1307
01:40:49,140 --> 01:40:53,220
to log in for like 25 minutes and there are any able to do anything and a new

1308
01:40:53,220 --> 01:40:57,940
be soft representative apparently responded to the forum thread that's

1309
01:40:57,940 --> 01:41:02,740
over on their official Assassin's Creed 2 forum and saying clearly the extended

1310
01:41:02,740 --> 01:41:07,260
downtime and lengthy login issues are unacceptable particularly as I've been

1311
01:41:07,260 --> 01:41:12,580
told these servers are constantly monitored well they apparently watch

1312
01:41:12,580 --> 01:41:18,420
them go down yeah fuck that up didn't you I'm honoring them crushing and then

1313
01:41:18,420 --> 01:41:24,100
they added I'll do whatever what I can to get more information on this issue

1314
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:29,220
and here's the fruit or more on what the issue is first thing tomorrow and push

1315
01:41:29,220 --> 01:41:34,620
for a resolution is sure it's this will happen again in the future it doesn't

1316
01:41:34,620 --> 01:41:39,500
matter they've already cracked it forget about it because what apparently

1317
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:43,980
happened is there is a cracker group out there that figured out that hey guess

1318
01:41:43,980 --> 01:41:49,180
what they have some sort of fail-safe and then in the case that will be soft

1319
01:41:49,180 --> 01:41:53,740
size to go out of business that will put out a patch that will apparently disable

1320
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:58,220
this DRM so that you can play your game just fine well guess what the codes in

1321
01:41:58,220 --> 01:42:08,460
there and they've activated it so thanks to be soft you made it easy we all knew

1322
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:13,340
this is gonna fucking happen and we all knew it's a stupid idea and guess what

1323
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:18,700
it's a stupid idea is it a fucking stupid idea it's a fucking stupid idea

1324
01:42:18,700 --> 01:42:22,140
it's the worst idea ever because all you're doing is punching the people that

1325
01:42:22,140 --> 01:42:25,860
legitimately paid for the program the people that want to hack it they're

1326
01:42:25,860 --> 01:42:29,380
gonna wait for a hack version to come out I don't think there's a PC title

1327
01:42:29,380 --> 01:42:33,140
out there that they haven't figured out a way around some sort of DRM for it so

1328
01:42:33,140 --> 01:42:40,180
oh well you know you tried you failed maybe you shouldn't try because it cost

1329
01:42:40,180 --> 01:42:41,180
money to try

1330
01:42:41,180 --> 01:42:45,100
alright so a lot of fucking confusion going on over a highly fucking

1331
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:48,340
controversial game six days and fallujah you might remember this game was

1332
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:51,500
supposed to fucking come out and it doesn't like one fucking Konami actually

1333
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:54,460
put it out because I was putting out and they're like now we don't have fucking

1334
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:57,180
be associated with this because they're working with terrorists or something

1335
01:42:57,180 --> 01:42:59,940
they're also working with the soldiers that were there and that wasn't gonna

1336
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:05,700
fucking stop atomic games and apparently IGN reported this week that six days and

1337
01:43:05,700 --> 01:43:10,780
fallujah is finished it's fucking done it is ready to come out but there's no

1338
01:43:10,780 --> 01:43:13,980
fucking release date announced just that the game is sitting there finished now

1339
01:43:13,980 --> 01:43:17,860
atomic games actually fucking followed up to this saying that well IGN yeah

1340
01:43:17,860 --> 01:43:22,500
they talked to somebody at atomic games and the game is finished and it's coming

1341
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:26,060
out but yeah we have another fucking game we're doing first and then six days

1342
01:43:26,060 --> 01:43:28,740
and fallujah will come out it's finished but that doesn't mean we're not gonna

1343
01:43:28,740 --> 01:43:31,940
fucking upgrade it new fucking features a new fucking technology and whatever the

1344
01:43:31,940 --> 01:43:36,060
fuck we feel like doing basically in a nutshell so I keep an eye on atomic games

1345
01:43:36,060 --> 01:43:38,500
I suppose if you really want more information on this game although I

1346
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:43,680
don't know the you know how you know that old saying strike when the iron is

1347
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:52,060
hot yeah well it's like you know the iron is frozen yeah put away anyhow on

1348
01:43:52,060 --> 01:43:54,980
some other fucking news if you still one of these people that don't have a

1349
01:43:54,980 --> 01:43:58,740
fucking Wii for some reason Walmart can sell you the bundle that everybody

1350
01:43:58,740 --> 01:44:03,660
fucking thought would be out already Walmart is selling we owe we in Nintendo

1351
01:44:03,660 --> 01:44:09,180
we Wii Sports Wii Sports Resort and the motion plus attachment it's available

1352
01:44:09,180 --> 01:44:14,900
right now one hundred and ninety nine dollars is the price for this so

1353
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:19,340
basically it's a normal we thing with Wii Sports Resort with it which you

1354
01:44:19,340 --> 01:44:22,740
know although Walmart I don't know they can kind of be fucking shady about some

1355
01:44:22,740 --> 01:44:28,020
things like I don't know censorship on albums a good deal is still still a good

1356
01:44:28,020 --> 01:44:31,260
deal and if you do not have a Nintendo Wii for whatever reason you want to be

1357
01:44:31,260 --> 01:44:36,500
limited supplies as if the supplies aren't limited enough already yeah so and

1358
01:44:36,500 --> 01:44:39,100
one of the fucking thing I have for you guys before I turn it over to dark

1359
01:44:39,100 --> 01:44:45,540
Sakura Tecmo Bowl there is a new Tecmo Bowl coming it's a new old Tecmo Bowl

1360
01:44:45,540 --> 01:44:49,780

1361
01:44:49,780 --> 01:44:52,340
a lot about sports games on this show because I don't fucking play a lot of

1362
01:44:52,340 --> 01:44:55,100
them cuz I know it's gonna sound weird but a lot of them are too fucking

1363
01:44:55,100 --> 01:44:59,180
complicated for me cuz I don't watch a lot of them on TV but I like the kind of

1364
01:44:59,180 --> 01:45:03,460
overly simplified ones like NBA Jam I always love that game in the fucking

1365
01:45:03,460 --> 01:45:07,700
arcades and this new one is somewhat interesting I fucking love Tecmo Bowl on

1366
01:45:07,700 --> 01:45:10,500
the NES I thought it was great so the idea that they're kind of doing this

1367
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:14,780
throwback I find very fucking exciting this will it feature real sugar this

1368
01:45:14,780 --> 01:45:18,980
time I don't know the idea of this was kind of leaked a little while ago thanks

1369
01:45:18,980 --> 01:45:22,860
to an ESRB rating but now it's been acknowledged Tecmo Bowl throwback is

1370
01:45:22,860 --> 01:45:26,020
coming out on the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network sometime in the

1371
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:31,860
spring it's a remake of Tecmo Super Bowl you can switch to classic 2d amongst I

1372
01:45:31,860 --> 01:45:36,700
guess the 3d the people who fucking made it are south and interactive they also

1373
01:45:36,700 --> 01:45:41,300
made that fucking loadrunner game and our type the loadrunner ever fucking

1374
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:46,160
come out on the Xbox 360 yeah sometime ago the R type ones pretty fucking rad

1375
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:49,340
if that's the R type that's on Xbox Live I think it's probably the r-10 fucking

1376
01:45:49,340 --> 01:45:55,060
rad so this is a good studio to be doing this all new 3d graphics and and and

1377
01:45:55,060 --> 01:46:00,940
online play fuck yeah Tecmo Bowl throwback will have 32 teams online

1378
01:46:00,940 --> 01:46:04,940
leaderboards and customizable options for the teams and the rosters I don't

1379
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:08,360
know like are these are they gonna be actual teams or no because every fake

1380
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:12,460
teams the fake teams like just they're called New York and Denver but it's not

1381
01:46:12,460 --> 01:46:17,380
like fucking the New York of the Denver still I'm all over I bet you never

1382
01:46:17,380 --> 01:46:21,020
thought you would hear me say this about a sports game here on OLR I am all

1383
01:46:21,020 --> 01:46:25,940
fucking about this game I am I'm very excited to fucking play this game dark

1384
01:46:25,940 --> 01:46:29,820
soccer has got a few stories for us and then some Twitter topics I sure fucking

1385
01:46:29,820 --> 01:46:37,620
do rock band we are getting some songs white stripes pack which will be for 40

1386
01:46:37,620 --> 01:46:43,500
points $5.50 fell in love with the girls seven nation army and you don't know

1387
01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:47,700
what love is you just do as you're told individual tracks the future has decent

1388
01:46:47,700 --> 01:46:54,460
days and nights hounds of love this wasn't that a Kate Bush song anyway the

1389
01:46:54,460 --> 01:46:58,900
James gang walk away Neil pert the hockey theme and Seamus all of this and

1390
01:46:58,900 --> 01:47:09,260
tie you down and other news there is a K something that was given to me as an

1391
01:47:09,260 --> 01:47:14,100
incomplete link that I have no idea what it is um DJ max technica 2 has a teaser

1392
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:21,460
out so I guess people can go watch it and then the 8-bit left for dead dude is

1393
01:47:21,460 --> 01:47:27,920
doing Megaman 9 HD remix so keep your eyes open for that although I bet

1394
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:31,220
nobody's gonna ever fucking play it cuz there'll be a lawsuit that'll stop it if

1395
01:47:31,220 --> 01:47:34,060
they ever try to put that out cuz that's just the fucking way the world works

1396
01:47:34,060 --> 01:47:37,700
I'll try course it's not Activision it's a Capcom who knows maybe they'll be a

1397
01:47:37,700 --> 01:47:41,860
little cooler but I don't know I kind of think you know okay fucking Megaman 10

1398
01:47:41,860 --> 01:47:45,500
came out on the fucking weed this week right and I'm fucking waiting for PSN or

1399
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:49,220
Xbox 360 before I spend my fucking hard-earned money on this game but I'm

1400
01:47:49,220 --> 01:47:53,620
kind of hearing a lot of the early fucking feedback is that it's kind of

1401
01:47:53,620 --> 01:47:56,960
just Megaman 9 all over again and I'm kind of fucking thinking well wasn't

1402
01:47:56,960 --> 01:48:00,620
Megaman 9 just the first fucking eight games all over again I mean that's what

1403
01:48:00,620 --> 01:48:05,000
the charm was about it has the fucking retro ness of Megaman worn off is is

1404
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:09,980
retro really fucking old now I don't know what do you think Loki is is is

1405
01:48:09,980 --> 01:48:14,780
Megaman 10 too much or what I don't think it's too much I think you know

1406
01:48:14,780 --> 01:48:21,660
it'd be pretty cool to see them release more of these retro games promise they're

1407
01:48:21,660 --> 01:48:26,780
just not as good as Megaman 2 but I don't know I'm kind of glad that they're doing

1408
01:48:26,780 --> 01:48:31,100
that because it really it comes down to those games prove that it's all about

1409
01:48:31,100 --> 01:48:35,580
gameplay it's not necessarily graphics and you don't have to have really shiny

1410
01:48:35,580 --> 01:48:41,220
HD 3d you know modeled graphics for a Megaman game or even a lot of games it

1411
01:48:41,220 --> 01:48:45,580
can be just fine with just you know 8-bit retro stuff and that hell I'd

1412
01:48:45,580 --> 01:48:49,100
like to see a studio that only did that that'd be pretty awesome I think Dark

1413
01:48:49,100 --> 01:48:52,060
Touch Studio raises a fucking good point in chat saying well I don't think

1414
01:48:52,060 --> 01:48:54,660
Capcom would want people playing the equivalent of one of their recent

1415
01:48:54,660 --> 01:48:58,440
releases for free yeah I can see that they're still probably making some

1416
01:48:58,440 --> 01:49:03,060
fucking money off Megaman 9 and so yeah they would shut this shit down if it was

1417
01:49:03,060 --> 01:49:06,540
getting out there too much but I don't think it's a bad thing you know why not

1418
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:10,420
you know now that they kind of did the fucking retro 3d just go in and make

1419
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:14,700
some HD sprites keep the same game keep the same just just or even pretty or

1420
01:49:14,700 --> 01:49:18,980
even pretty you know what you could do and here's what they really need to do

1421
01:49:18,980 --> 01:49:23,140
you need to put fucking Megaman 9 and Megaman 10 like on the DS or something

1422
01:49:23,140 --> 01:49:26,500
like that so I can take it with me and play that shit you know I mean those

1423
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:31,700
ROMs got to be pretty small anyways that aside or new Megaman collection would be

1424
01:49:31,700 --> 01:49:36,160
kind of cool with those in there fuck let's make them if they want to make a

1425
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:40,120
3d game make them another fucking Megaman Legends that would be fucking

1426
01:49:40,120 --> 01:49:45,100
awesome alright let's get to some Twitter topics

1427
01:49:45,100 --> 01:49:50,440
suit you fucking people on Twitter have to say every week we read your tweets

1428
01:49:50,440 --> 01:49:55,660
show us your tweets at OLR lots of fucking celebration that finally a year

1429
01:49:55,660 --> 01:49:58,660
and a half after I think the idea was first announced we are finally having

1430
01:49:58,660 --> 01:50:02,920
our fucking fuck show up against the Oscars tonight in a moment of protest

1431
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:06,580
not everybody fucking on board with the fuck show though sturlock sends us a

1432
01:50:06,580 --> 01:50:11,740
tweet to be perfectly honest this joke is already painfully old it's not gonna

1433
01:50:11,740 --> 01:50:18,020
be for everybody keep in mind we're not just doing it to say fuck a lot which

1434
01:50:18,020 --> 01:50:22,100
although I will say that's a nice benefit but it is a protest against

1435
01:50:22,100 --> 01:50:26,180
people taking their time to time out of their busy schedules they should be

1436
01:50:26,180 --> 01:50:30,220
balancing budgets to tell us that we shouldn't swear that swearing makes us

1437
01:50:30,220 --> 01:50:35,220
somehow unintelligent it's the same fucking show tonight just more fuck but

1438
01:50:35,220 --> 01:50:38,420
I don't know I was a little worried coming into it it might get fucking old

1439
01:50:38,420 --> 01:50:42,220
after three hours but we'll see two hours and I still feel pretty fucking

1440
01:50:42,220 --> 01:50:52,300
good you guys doing okay all right let's see spazzinator says some very nasty

1441
01:50:52,300 --> 01:50:55,940
words to Sony I got I bet yeah I bet he'll call in later and say some more

1442
01:50:55,940 --> 01:50:59,780
about that but also says let's see if I got this right this is in response to

1443
01:50:59,780 --> 01:51:03,620
the heavy rain thing spazzinator PSN says let's see if I got this right heads

1444
01:51:03,620 --> 01:51:08,860
blown off fine hot crowbar up the ass fine mass murder fine tits or badge what

1445
01:51:08,860 --> 01:51:17,460
sicko wants to see that fucking shit dude it's like the biggest like I don't

1446
01:51:17,460 --> 01:51:21,940
even know what word you would say to describe this just it's it's just this

1447
01:51:21,940 --> 01:51:29,580
big glaring hypocrisy in in the media and in society that has been going on

1448
01:51:29,580 --> 01:51:35,500
for a very long time it's not just fucking video games but it's movies too

1449
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:39,340
what's that movie there was some movie about like it's called this movie is

1450
01:51:39,340 --> 01:51:43,300
rated R or something like that it explores like the NC 17 rating fucking

1451
01:51:43,300 --> 01:51:47,860
fascinating dark touch to you once everyone to fucking know that I love

1452
01:51:47,860 --> 01:51:51,660
this song resumes this week on the site that's good I like seeing some more

1453
01:51:51,660 --> 01:51:55,980
fucking content on olr hopefully there's more than just the I love that song

1454
01:51:55,980 --> 01:52:00,060
segment which was you know everything that was on the website but I do I like

1455
01:52:00,060 --> 01:52:03,940
music gaming music is good and so I always like the I love that song segment

1456
01:52:03,940 --> 01:52:08,500
the diversity of stuff that they picked so fuck yeah and lastly Takeo Ray says

1457
01:52:08,500 --> 01:52:12,740
his tweet wants to know so does anyone have an f-bomb count for the show I

1458
01:52:12,740 --> 01:52:18,220
think they lost track in the first fucking like five minutes problem was

1459
01:52:18,220 --> 01:52:21,520
Dark Sakura sat there went fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck and that's faster

1460
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:25,720
than anyone could probably tally so that's more of something that you'll

1461
01:52:25,720 --> 01:52:29,580
figure out later on once they the podcast comes fucking out hey if every

1462
01:52:29,580 --> 01:52:32,740
if anyone actually wants to sit there and fucking count all the words I'm

1463
01:52:32,740 --> 01:52:37,220
pretty fucking impressed and I mean I doubt it Guinness will pay attention to

1464
01:52:37,220 --> 01:52:40,700
something like this because it's just a fucking podcast but hey they'll pay

1465
01:52:40,700 --> 01:52:43,620
attention to like what the longest pretzel is or some shit like that I

1466
01:52:43,620 --> 01:52:48,280
don't fucking get them both of the shit that they fucking record is ridiculous

1467
01:52:48,280 --> 01:52:51,900
maybe we can get sure me to hey maybe we can buy the gaming podcast or another

1468
01:52:51,900 --> 01:53:01,340
game fight because the gaming Guinness World Records think well we haven't

1469
01:53:01,340 --> 01:53:05,300
started talking about the tester yet I did watch episode 2 of the tester oh was

1470
01:53:05,300 --> 01:53:11,340
it worth a Shermie poop yes I still feel the same about it it's you know it's not

1471
01:53:11,340 --> 01:53:15,980
the most terrible thing to ever reach my television but it's no RuPaul's Drag

1472
01:53:15,980 --> 01:53:20,380
Race which would be the best thing to ever grace my television it's it's a big

1473
01:53:20,380 --> 01:53:28,220
what the fuck ever it's a three out of five through Paul drag races um it

1474
01:53:28,220 --> 01:53:32,700
should have to lip-sync for its life I do think that is something I don't know

1475
01:53:32,700 --> 01:53:35,820
it's pretty obvious that they fucking film this whole show in the scope of

1476
01:53:35,820 --> 01:53:39,260
like three or four days like like they're doing a little challenge in the

1477
01:53:39,260 --> 01:53:42,700
morning kick somebody off to a challenge in the evening kick somebody off to it

1478
01:53:42,700 --> 01:53:51,140
was really fucking fast I'm sure whatever just as $5,000 dude I'd go on

1479
01:53:51,140 --> 01:53:54,420
the tech like if it's just like four days or whatever to film the show I'd

1480
01:53:54,420 --> 01:54:02,420
fucking go on the tester win the $5,000 and then quit fuck you I'm out of here

1481
01:54:02,420 --> 01:54:08,540
all right I'm not gonna be a fucking tester you'll pay shit there if they

1482
01:54:08,540 --> 01:54:11,340
were willing to pay I'm not gonna say what I make of my current job now but if

1483
01:54:11,340 --> 01:54:14,180
they're willing to match that I do it although I don't know like if they had

1484
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:20,460
it I gotta be fucking honest if instead the competition was like be the new host

1485
01:54:20,460 --> 01:54:25,020
of PlayStation shows or something like that I would give that some serious

1486
01:54:25,020 --> 01:54:28,020
fucking thought because I'd be like oh I could get do something I really like for

1487
01:54:28,020 --> 01:54:33,420
a living that might be worth it you know money don't buy everything I think if

1488
01:54:33,420 --> 01:54:37,100
the contest were be the next fucking PlayStation host of fucking yeah ever

1489
01:54:37,100 --> 01:54:40,340
they would probably have like I just like be the spokesperson for something

1490
01:54:40,340 --> 01:54:45,500
and I'd you know compete in that and win and then the surprise at the end by the

1491
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:51,700
way you get to be a spokesperson for Apple god damn it Bo fuck you it to call

1492
01:54:51,700 --> 01:54:54,940
one our chat room chat that orange laundry calm said episode four of the

1493
01:54:54,940 --> 01:54:59,660
tester is supposed to be larping oh god that's gonna be awesome oh well I'm only

1494
01:54:59,660 --> 01:55:04,900
through the second episode I just watched it in you know waste time people

1495
01:55:04,900 --> 01:55:11,140
who were doing the live-action avatar roleplay themselves blue and they were

1496
01:55:11,140 --> 01:55:14,580
legit they've got a website in a group in everything I have fucking heard about

1497
01:55:14,580 --> 01:55:20,300
these people that that are depressed after they watch fucking avatar because

1498
01:55:20,300 --> 01:55:24,540
they they want to fucking live on Pandora like it's fucking real okay I

1499
01:55:24,540 --> 01:55:28,740
larped but I put vampire and you know what we didn't go running out in the

woods acting stupid we just ran around downtown mobile acting stupid all right

1501
01:55:34,460 --> 01:55:37,820
let's move on with some more fucking gaming news then the mailbag then your

1502
01:55:37,820 --> 01:55:41,060

1503
01:55:41,060 --> 01:55:45,660
fucking wait for that remember every call counts all right we might have to

1504
01:55:45,660 --> 01:55:48,700
institute the time limit on calls tonight I think we're gonna do that I

1505
01:55:48,700 --> 01:55:52,260
think we're gonna do rapid-fire calls tonight just so everybody can have their

1508
01:56:00,260 --> 01:56:03,220
what though instead of getting three calls we could get through like seven if

1509
01:56:03,220 --> 01:56:08,780
we do a time limit so we're gonna do that tonight all right uh Loki some

1510
01:56:08,780 --> 01:56:12,420
fucking gaming news for us this also has nothing to fucking do with the

1511
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:16,180
PlayStation Network going well the PlayStation are technically didn't go

1512
01:56:16,180 --> 01:56:22,340
down but you know PlayStation 3 is it way back in late 2008 apparently a

1513
01:56:22,340 --> 01:56:27,580
Pennsylvania teenager playing SOCOM US Navy SEALs got kicked out of a

1514
01:56:27,580 --> 01:56:32,960
tournament for using a cheat mod so he decided to take revenge by crashing the

1515
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:39,080
PlayStation website for 11 days and what's funny though is Sony has decided

1516
01:56:39,080 --> 01:56:46,460
you know what they filed a federal grand jury investigation which led to the

1517
01:56:46,460 --> 01:56:53,060
perpetrator getting arrested the hacker pled guilty to four felony charges in

1518
01:56:53,060 --> 01:56:59,540
juvie court and apparently he got access he said he apparently got access to the

1519
01:56:59,540 --> 01:57:04,140
site servers and let loose a virus that brought everything down and his methods

1520
01:57:04,140 --> 01:57:09,160
I guess weren't described but some experts or whatever contacted by local

1521
01:57:09,160 --> 01:57:13,700
TV station said they were so sophisticated that someone else couldn't

1522
01:57:13,700 --> 01:57:20,660
pull it off hopefully by now they've already fixed that stuff apparently also

1523
01:57:20,660 --> 01:57:26,720
it says in exchange the team pleaded guilty the four counts and lawful use of

1524
01:57:26,720 --> 01:57:30,780
a computer criminal use of computer computer trespassing and distribution of

1525
01:57:30,780 --> 01:57:35,180
a computer virus in exchange for a process prosecutors dropping the 11

1526
01:57:35,180 --> 01:57:43,620

01:57:43,620 --> 01:57:49,100
funnier is he's from La Trobe which we have a road over here named La Trobe but

1528
01:57:49,100 --> 01:57:52,180
this is all Pittsburgh new Pennsylvania I actually know where that is in

1529
01:57:52,180 --> 01:57:55,220

1537
01:58:32,140 --> 01:58:38,140
stuff on there there's some levels that were like really difficult levels I

1538
01:58:38,140 --> 01:58:41,820
forget what they're called though but oh man we were busting up there like on

1539
01:58:41,820 --> 01:58:47,020
some of the top rated user levels just go through playing those there's some

1540
01:58:47,020 --> 01:58:52,140
really funny fucking levels on there and this shouldn't really come as a big

1541
01:58:52,140 --> 01:58:57,140
fucking surprise but Media Molecule has now been absorbed fully as a first party

1542
01:58:57,140 --> 01:59:02,220
company for Sony so Sony is now suck them up into their collective and Media

1543
01:59:02,220 --> 01:59:06,460
Molecule now has their fucking check signed by Sony so there it is

1544
01:59:06,460 --> 01:59:12,460
it's Dan Media Molecule is no longer an independent studio and by the way a

1545
01:59:12,460 --> 01:59:16,380
comment from Michael Denny the senior vice president of Sony worldwide studios

1546
01:59:16,380 --> 01:59:21,940
quote Media Molecule will simply continue to make great games welcoming

1547
01:59:21,940 --> 01:59:25,220
Media Molecule into the PlayStation family will allow us to better support

1548
01:59:25,220 --> 01:59:29,740
their future titles and ambitions they're really fucked now just kidding I

1549
01:59:29,740 --> 01:59:35,420
added that last part myself all right and Dan yelled from the living room

1550
01:59:35,420 --> 01:59:39,300
that's only if Activision buys them boy if Activision comes for your company

1551
01:59:39,300 --> 01:59:46,380
run bitch run I can't say me I can't wait for them to close Blizzard that'll

1552
01:59:46,380 --> 01:59:53,940
be the day dark soccer would you got for us well yeah there was a version of a

1553
01:59:53,940 --> 01:59:59,220
number of different Nintendo games some of them super rare that were going on

1554
01:59:59,220 --> 02:00:07,500
eBay there was one in particular family fun fitness stadium events it hit a bid

1555
02:00:07,500 --> 02:00:15,500
amount of eight hundred thousand two hundred dollars fucking eBay yeah

1556
02:00:15,500 --> 02:00:20,580
scammers you'd like anybody who has that much money to blow on an NES game which

1557
02:00:20,580 --> 02:00:26,740
is actually the highest game on there right now is bubble bath babes with the

1558
02:00:26,740 --> 02:00:31,300
box for two thousand nine hundred and ninety five dollars and let me say every

1559
02:00:31,300 --> 02:00:36,940
fucking penny I'll offer what I'll offer a one cent bid on it I don't think you

1560
02:00:36,940 --> 02:00:41,860
can put a one cent bid when you have to do three thousand best offer five bucks

1561
02:00:41,860 --> 02:00:47,020
only off topic here just thought I'd mention this because it's not fucking

1562
02:00:47,020 --> 02:00:51,940
allowed okay well this is going back to the fucking sir we had about during

1563
02:00:51,940 --> 02:00:57,380
rapid-fire about the Ubisoft DRM here's why their server went down do the

1564
02:00:57,380 --> 02:01:02,420
exceptional demand we're currently expert experiencing difficulties yes

1565
02:01:02,420 --> 02:01:06,500
that's right because their games sold and people bought them and then try to

1566
02:01:06,500 --> 02:01:11,660
play them and it logs in online it caused server strain and therefore it's

1567
02:01:11,660 --> 02:01:16,260
not work so basically if you buy their games it breaks the server why don't

1568
02:01:16,260 --> 02:01:19,620
they just fucking say it's a DDoS attack because that's clearly what's going on

1569
02:01:19,620 --> 02:01:24,700
right it's not it's just from people playing their games don't you think

1570
02:01:24,700 --> 02:01:29,380
that's just a blow to bullshit just know it's a face if they're just stupid

1571
02:01:29,380 --> 02:01:33,500
exceptional demand could be a bunch of inquiries to their server I think they're

1572
02:01:33,500 --> 02:01:39,020
being DDoSed which isn't okay I think that's fucked up like I don't think it's

1573
02:01:39,020 --> 02:01:43,740
even worse if that's the case oh dude the exceptional demand well that will be

1574
02:01:43,740 --> 02:01:49,260
a problem going forward okay I would you don't fucking take all these statements

1575
02:01:49,260 --> 02:01:52,820
at face value though because look at what Sony said earlier this week we fix

1576
02:01:52,820 --> 02:01:56,580
the fucking date problem no you didn't you waited it out you fucking waited it

1577
02:01:56,580 --> 02:01:59,860
out and then put out a press release about how fucking awesome you are to

1578
02:01:59,860 --> 02:02:06,420
fix the problem in exactly 24 hours come on we weren't born yesterday due to

1579
02:02:06,420 --> 02:02:18,060
exceptional demand you know what your your fucking DRM is about as in demand

1580
02:02:18,060 --> 02:02:22,820
as a fucking Yanni CD at Lollapalooza okay that's how fucking in demand your

1581
02:02:22,820 --> 02:02:34,980
thing is anyhow more news than the mailbag that's just funny oh sorry so this

1582
02:02:34,980 --> 02:02:39,020
is kind of cool rock band network finally launched in rock band network

1583
02:02:39,020 --> 02:02:44,500
you may remember is kind of an extension of the XNA where anybody that has a

1584
02:02:44,500 --> 02:02:49,340
membership to the XNA can basically download the tools that they need to

1585
02:02:49,340 --> 02:02:54,380
convert their music into rock band tracks and then you can go ahead and

1586
02:02:54,380 --> 02:03:02,140
sell them online well they launched with 105 songs which is fucking awesome try

1587
02:03:02,140 --> 02:03:08,780
that guitar hero seriously or DJ hero don't even get me started DJ hero to

1588
02:03:08,780 --> 02:03:13,940
download packs yeah I should have figured no but seriously compared this

1589
02:03:13,940 --> 02:03:18,020
to what they have for you know it's our hero where they have their basic service

1590
02:03:18,020 --> 02:03:23,020
you can create your own tracks and throw them on there for free download but this

1591
02:03:23,020 --> 02:03:30,100
is like way better and 105 tracks launch so far the song ranges from price ranges

1592
02:03:30,100 --> 02:03:35,180
are about 80 to 160 Microsoft points or a buck or two and you know just kind of

1593
02:03:35,180 --> 02:03:40,180
some of the artists that are on here that I thought were pretty cool flogging

1594
02:03:40,180 --> 02:03:44,380
Molly's on here with drunken lullabies the live version and requiem for a dying

1595

1596
02:03:52,420 --> 02:03:56,660

1597
02:03:56,660 --> 02:04:02,780

1600
02:04:14,100 --> 02:04:19,460
don't recognize what a lot of other people might was it the shins Australia

1601
02:04:19,460 --> 02:04:26,980
I recognize the shins there's some other artists the main drag see here scratching

1602
02:04:26,980 --> 02:04:34,020
the itch whatever but tons of stuff and there's gonna be more added each day as

1603
02:04:34,020 --> 02:04:39,820

1604
02:04:39,820 --> 02:04:45,140
xbox 360 for 30 days after which a selection of standout tracks will become

1605
02:04:45,140 --> 02:04:51,140
available on the PlayStation 3 and the week I think a well our should have a

1606
02:04:51,140 --> 02:04:53,980
fucking song on there like I don't know we don't really have any we don't do

1607
02:04:53,980 --> 02:05:01,660
music really but I I think we should just we should have a fuck it's not an

1608
02:05:01,660 --> 02:05:05,580
original song yeah we have to come up with an OL our original song do we know

1609
02:05:05,580 --> 02:05:08,900
any fucking songwriters that could write us a fucking song that we just scream

1610
02:05:08,900 --> 02:05:14,020
the lyrics to over some like type of music I guess I have some type of guitar

1611
02:05:14,020 --> 02:05:18,220
thing they can play like an epic guitar solo and a drum solo that we could all

1612
02:05:18,220 --> 02:05:21,660
sing come on does you guys wanna fucking sing a song on Rock Band Network can't

1613
02:05:21,660 --> 02:05:27,260

1614
02:05:27,260 --> 02:05:30,580
right if someone wants to put all that effort and work into it yeah sure I got

1615
02:05:30,580 --> 02:05:33,580
one more story for you guys and then we can get to the fucking mailbag this has

1616
02:05:33,580 --> 02:05:36,220
to do with an update to the code of conduct I gotta be honest although I'm

1617
02:05:36,220 --> 02:05:39,420
sure this probably pissed me off when I first fucking heard about it I totally

1618
02:05:39,420 --> 02:05:43,740
fucking forgot about it until this story came out this week that apparently Xbox

1619
02:05:43,740 --> 02:05:49,180
Live has now lifted the ban on using the terms lesbian gay bi transgender and

1620
02:05:49,180 --> 02:05:54,100
straight in your profiles so if you want to put hi I like games and I'm a big

1621
02:05:54,100 --> 02:05:59,540
lesbian in your profile it is okay to do that now so have a ball and I talked a

1622
02:05:59,540 --> 02:06:02,660
little bit about this on Bobby Black Wolf show tonight you know he's the show

1623
02:06:02,660 --> 02:06:06,180
before us at all games radio he's a much cleaner show than we are by the way he

1624
02:06:06,180 --> 02:06:10,620
is always kind enough to do a call with us and I was coming on how fucking like

1625
02:06:10,620 --> 02:06:14,460
you know I want to see Bobby I want to see Bobby do a fuck show man I want to

1626
02:06:14,460 --> 02:06:20,220
see him just go off one night sound like a Bobby unhinged although he well he

1627
02:06:20,220 --> 02:06:23,340
swears on his other show Friday night gaming but you know that's such a video

1628
02:06:23,340 --> 02:06:27,140
show that there's a lot of pause that you like if you're listening to it as a

1629
02:06:27,140 --> 02:06:29,540
radio show there's a lot of pauses because they're doing things on video

1630
02:06:29,540 --> 02:06:33,260
they're playing games and stuff it makes sense I just like to see Bobby just just

1631
02:06:33,260 --> 02:06:37,780
go off for an hour like I can't fucking believe this fucking I'd love it awesome

1632
02:06:37,780 --> 02:06:41,860
anyway I'm Bobby Shaw I was talking about this a little bit and I was just

1633
02:06:41,860 --> 02:06:46,140
saying like you know okay yeah I'm a I'm a gay guy and I I don't think I really

1634
02:06:46,140 --> 02:06:50,300
care that I can put this in my profile now especially on Xbox Live of all

1635
02:06:50,300 --> 02:06:56,180
places I don't want to put like I'm a gay gamer 31 from California like it's

1636
02:06:56,180 --> 02:07:03,140

1637
02:07:03,140 --> 02:07:08,100
such a big deal I mean yeah it's a part of your identity but it's not like I go

1638
02:07:08,100 --> 02:07:13,860
around saying hi I like everybody but I also agree that if someone wants to do

1639
02:07:13,860 --> 02:07:17,900
it they should have every right to I just don't I just don't understand why

1640
02:07:17,900 --> 02:07:21,140
you do it but okay if you want to put it on your profile you should have every

1641
02:07:21,140 --> 02:07:24,780
right without repercussion and people you know but you're probably gonna get

1642
02:07:24,780 --> 02:07:29,060

1672
02:09:51,300 --> 02:09:57,300
this comes from Jammer Jay whoa okay um who by the way sent me a very nice

1673
02:09:57,300 --> 02:10:04,340
Christmas Christmas card with um a sudoku puzzle in it and um isn't it

1674
02:10:04,340 --> 02:10:08,380
fucking March and you're just now getting a Christmas no he I got it it

1675
02:10:08,380 --> 02:10:14,940
bounced back so yeah and um and um and um he sent like I think and I have

1676
02:10:14,940 --> 02:10:19,140
judgment card or something anyway um here was a situation posed to me and I

1677
02:10:19,140 --> 02:10:22,900
wanted to get all our thoughts on this since we are all about the same age

1678
02:10:22,900 --> 02:10:28,740
here's the scenario my coworker gave me Dave and my other co-workers would put

1679
02:10:28,740 --> 02:10:31,940
the money into a pot in order to win the pot I would have to stop playing all

1680
02:10:31,940 --> 02:10:35,860
video games for a month I told him I would not do it and then it seemed a bit

1681
02:10:35,860 --> 02:10:39,260
ridiculous to me Dave's reasoning was that my life would get immediately

1682
02:10:39,260 --> 02:10:42,420
better and that I would be a better person and go out more the ironic thing

1683
02:10:42,420 --> 02:10:46,340
was that we were dragged out to a country bar and shooting pool which I

1684
02:10:46,340 --> 02:10:51,580
did not enjoy as much but I could do I think we were all met anyways being

1685
02:10:51,580 --> 02:10:56,140
dragged there also like many others he seems he sees the gaming lifestyle as

1686
02:10:56,140 --> 02:11:01,540
negative and he does not know even really what me like many others not in

1687
02:11:01,540 --> 02:11:08,180
Idaho okay I do a large amount of gaming everything from Beatles rock band on

1688
02:11:08,180 --> 02:11:11,620
360 to World of Warcraft but I balance this out with my weekly workouts

1689
02:11:11,620 --> 02:11:17,060
including DDR and my other grown-up things quotes I am NOT a poop soccer okay

1690
02:11:17,060 --> 02:11:21,780
I believe that it is what makes us individuals to be different and that we

1691
02:11:21,780 --> 02:11:26,140
can have different hobbies and interests different than others to enjoy life some

1692
02:11:26,140 --> 02:11:29,260
of the activities that people think are normal drinking playing pool partying I

1693
02:11:29,260 --> 02:11:33,820
have not done but I feel empty doing them even with others I would rather not

1694
02:11:33,820 --> 02:11:37,580
conform and do what I enjoy by myself then to feel empty so what do you guys

1695
02:11:37,580 --> 02:11:41,260
think is there anything else I should say to him to back up my point by the

1696
02:11:41,260 --> 02:11:45,220
way in Idaho most what most consider normal is all outdoorsy stuff floating

1697
02:11:45,220 --> 02:11:49,020
river hiking camping BSU football hunting I'm not from Idaho I'm a

1698
02:11:49,020 --> 02:11:52,900
Floridian this email has been brought to you by red Robin the home of the

1699
02:11:52,900 --> 02:11:57,060
delicious chop house burger now I'm fucking hungry for one of those Western

1700
02:11:57,060 --> 02:12:02,700
chicken we went to federal records today I ate an ostrich burger yummy fucking

1701
02:12:02,700 --> 02:12:08,260
delicious anyway um well first of all I know a lot of Floridians I lived about

1702
02:12:08,260 --> 02:12:11,420
an hour from Pensacola and a lot of them were back were right very well rednecks

1703
02:12:11,420 --> 02:12:16,260
um so yeah all the same stuff you know what just tell them like you know flat

1704
02:12:16,260 --> 02:12:25,420
out say I'm an individual this is I'm not going to change myself to please you

1705
02:12:25,420 --> 02:12:30,860
if he's your fucking friend he should understand that there's some fucking

1706
02:12:30,860 --> 02:12:34,500
things whatever I mean it's hanging out going to country bars he's a friend of

1707
02:12:34,500 --> 02:12:37,540
some some sort if he's your fucking friend you should understand there are

1708
02:12:37,540 --> 02:12:40,980
things you like to do you're not hurting anyone playing a video game you're not

1709
02:12:40,980 --> 02:12:45,540
doing nothing but playing video games you're holding down a steady job it's

1710
02:12:45,540 --> 02:12:49,940
not anyone's place to tell another person how to live their life end of

1711
02:12:49,940 --> 02:12:56,140
story that's all I think if you know what though I think here's here's my

1712
02:12:56,140 --> 02:13:01,100
fucking suggestion if you're gonna do that for him he should play a video game

1713
02:13:01,100 --> 02:13:05,700
with you and see what it is that you enjoy so much about video games I think

1714
02:13:05,700 --> 02:13:09,220
if you're gonna do that and go to a country bar which props to you because I

1715
02:13:09,220 --> 02:13:12,260
don't know how long I could stand something like that but I would do it

1716
02:13:12,260 --> 02:13:15,040
for a friend if a friend really wanted me to go to a country bar for a night I

1717
02:13:15,040 --> 02:13:18,980
would go but I think in return you should ask he should sit down play a

1718
02:13:18,980 --> 02:13:22,540
video game with you and try to find a game that you think he might like I mean

1719
02:13:22,540 --> 02:13:26,660
you know your friend better than I do you might find that new Super Mario

1720
02:13:26,660 --> 02:13:30,780
Brothers Wii is a game or maybe Call of Duty modern warfare is the game up to

1721
02:13:30,780 --> 02:13:36,660
you my friend but if this guy's really your friend like he should just take you

1722
02:13:36,660 --> 02:13:39,940
as you are even if he's just a co-worker then if he's a co-worker then you get

1723
02:13:39,940 --> 02:13:43,500
this whole other thing involved where if he's it's to the point where he's

1724
02:13:43,500 --> 02:13:47,880
annoying you you have every right home stop talking to you honestly like then

1725
02:13:47,880 --> 02:13:51,500
again that only really works in California I yeah I mean I would hate

1726
02:13:51,500 --> 02:13:56,700
that you would have to go that far with it honestly just encourage him to be

1727
02:13:56,700 --> 02:13:59,660
more open-minded and just let him know hey there's nothing wrong with video

1728
02:13:59,660 --> 02:14:05,520
games dude call a modern warfare made more money than most Hollywood movies do

1729
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:09,900
I mean it is an art form I don't know I don't know this guy maybe follow fancy

1730
02:14:09,900 --> 02:14:16,100
13 and the stories would maybe maybe plays the deer hunter I don't know which

1731
02:14:16,100 --> 02:14:20,460
that game is actually kind of funny um so anyway next fucking email dear olr I

1732
02:14:20,460 --> 02:14:24,500
finished heavy rain last Sunday I wasn't affected by the ps3 clock glitch and was

1733
02:14:24,500 --> 02:14:33,460
able to beat sorry beat off to and beat heavy rain with no problem at all Oh

1734
02:14:33,460 --> 02:14:38,620
special person to me heavy rain is comparable to a show like rescue me mad

1735
02:14:38,620 --> 02:14:43,820
men and burn notice but notice is pretty cool damn like to rescue me um these are

1736
02:14:43,820 --> 02:14:48,220
shows that would have been absolutely dull to me when I was young teenager but

1737
02:14:48,220 --> 02:14:52,460
really deep and compelling now that I have matured into more adult tastes do

1738
02:14:52,460 --> 02:14:58,860
you feel the same way they're not shows that I enjoy but I see why people like

1739
02:14:58,860 --> 02:15:02,540
them I mean like I said Dan loves rescue me I like Dennis Leary I mean I think

1740
02:15:02,540 --> 02:15:08,100
he's pretty hilarious I watched the end of nip tuck this week it went out with a

1741
02:15:08,100 --> 02:15:13,780
fizzle hmm it was just like there's like and we give up it was basically kind of

1742
02:15:13,780 --> 02:15:18,100
I was really upset because there was no new RuPaul's drag race this week but

1743
02:15:18,100 --> 02:15:21,100
there was a new project runway and I completely agreed with who they sent

1744
02:15:21,100 --> 02:15:27,420
home is that what we're talking about I think it's talking about serious dramas

1745
02:15:27,420 --> 02:15:30,660
dealing with the issues that people don't like to talk about I think there

1746
02:15:30,660 --> 02:15:35,900
are certainly some shows I didn't really watch as a kid that I could fucking

1747
02:15:35,900 --> 02:15:39,020
appreciate a little more now that maybe I couldn't appreciate because I was too

1748
02:15:39,020 --> 02:15:42,420
young to understand I'm sure there were shows like that I can't think of

1749
02:15:42,420 --> 02:15:45,060
anything off the top of my head but there's a few shows though that that

1750
02:15:45,060 --> 02:15:48,740
grow up with you if you know what I mean like watching freaking Rocky and

1751
02:15:48,740 --> 02:15:53,700
Bullwinkle or Beverly Hills 90210 I mean I can't watch that new one it's such

1752
02:15:53,700 --> 02:15:58,100
bullshit compared to the old one I did I fucking grew up with Brandon and Brenda

1753
02:15:58,100 --> 02:16:04,700
I mean they're my homeboys sorry I thought she was on the show now I think

1754
02:16:04,700 --> 02:16:07,780
she did like a guest thing but it's not the same because now she's gonna be on

1755
02:16:07,780 --> 02:16:14,620
the show yeah some of them are on the show there was one I watched God I

1756
02:16:14,620 --> 02:16:19,540
watched some weird TV when I'm at home sometimes I watched this show

1757
02:16:19,540 --> 02:16:24,540
overhauling it's basically one of those you know they take a car and soup it up

1758
02:16:24,540 --> 02:16:36,380
type shows and they did one for what's his name in I remember the guy's name on

1759
02:16:36,380 --> 02:16:42,980
90210 yeah he is hearing in searing why do I know that yeah they did his uh I'm

1760
02:16:42,980 --> 02:16:46,380
silently hitting my head in shame he was on Dancing with the Stars I think that

1761
02:16:46,380 --> 02:16:50,780
yeah that's where they all finish reading email yeah yeah yeah also I need

1762
02:16:50,780 --> 02:16:54,540
help with DJ hero I seem to be unable to perform the blue button scratch

1763
02:16:54,540 --> 02:16:58,400
consistently and effectively it doesn't matter which hand I use or whether the

1764
02:16:58,400 --> 02:17:02,020
buttons are on the left or right of the turntable controller I fail on the

1765
02:17:02,020 --> 02:17:06,740
consistent basis are there any tips you can give me Loki I'm surprised it's the

1766
02:17:06,740 --> 02:17:10,140
blue one that you're having trouble with that's the one that is on the inside of

1767
02:17:10,140 --> 02:17:13,660
camera well what kind of surprises me is that he has the same problem even if he

1768
02:17:13,660 --> 02:17:16,820
flips through the first thing I would have said is play left-handed mode it's

1769
02:17:16,820 --> 02:17:20,600
probably inside one I'm guessing because it's hard to get a grip on it what you

1770
02:17:20,600 --> 02:17:24,300
need to do is when you have your hand on the actual turntable is I normally put

1771
02:17:24,300 --> 02:17:29,340
my thumb I rest my thumb on the outside on the actual edge of the turntable and

1772
02:17:29,340 --> 02:17:33,460
use that to kind of move the turntable because if you just rely on you know the

1773
02:17:33,460 --> 02:17:37,140
friction of your finger on that button it's not gonna work you have to keep

1774
02:17:37,140 --> 02:17:41,900
your thumb held down to create that kind of like friction there or it's too loose

1775
02:17:41,900 --> 02:17:45,660
and you'll get all these scratches you don't really want you have to use your

1776
02:17:45,660 --> 02:17:49,380
thumb to I think that attraction that's where your problem comes in but maybe

1777
02:17:49,380 --> 02:17:51,780
like I'm afraid we're gonna get a follow-up email like I'm already doing

1778
02:17:51,780 --> 02:17:55,060
that well then you just need practice more you might just have to take down

1779
02:17:55,060 --> 02:17:59,820
honestly take down the difficulty you might be playing on two I I think maybe

1780
02:17:59,820 --> 02:18:02,900
you're me I don't know I'm guessing what I've been a longtime fan of Bahmani so

1781
02:18:02,900 --> 02:18:05,620
you're trying to take it a little more aggressive I've been doing this but I

1782
02:18:05,620 --> 02:18:10,540
haven't done it yet I've been meaning to take like aggressively it's an adverb

1783
02:18:10,540 --> 02:18:15,920
whatever I don't like adverbs oh yeah we'll fuck you back we need to take like

1784
02:18:15,920 --> 02:18:21,140
a metal plate or something like that and find the actual dead zones on each side

1785
02:18:21,140 --> 02:18:24,500
you know whatever because there's little dead zones where you can actually move

1786
02:18:24,500 --> 02:18:27,740
the marker and it'll finally move all the way over to the left and right and

1787
02:18:27,740 --> 02:18:32,060
just put a plate there so that basically it's just all Center unless you go far

1788
02:18:32,060 --> 02:18:36,260
right far left because I hate it where you just don't go far enough or

1789
02:18:36,260 --> 02:18:40,500
something like that it doesn't register so that'd be kind of cool fucking play

1790
02:18:40,500 --> 02:18:44,060
DJ hero in a while I really need to I'm kind of disappointed price of them at

02:19:43,060 --> 02:19:46,340
figure out why until I found out her husband works for the company I'm a store

1806
02:19:46,340 --> 02:19:49,300
manager for game crazy in Colorado and I think it would be interesting to hear

1807
02:19:49,300 --> 02:19:52,260
the opinions and thoughts on what's going on especially coming from someone

1808
02:19:52,260 --> 02:19:55,980
who works in a different district and region personally I am very concerned of

1809
02:19:55,980 --> 02:19:58,460
what's going on and it would be interesting to chat about it on your

1810
02:19:58,460 --> 02:20:03,380
show please do not use my name for obvious reasons but peas do respond I

1811

1817
02:20:47,260 --> 02:20:50,940

1818
02:20:50,940 --> 02:20:57,540
answer is no fucking comment well we can ask him so Dan a wild Dan has appeared

1819
02:20:57,540 --> 02:21:02,900
we got an email from a listener in Colorado who is a game crazy manager and

1820
02:21:02,900 --> 02:21:08,620
wants to know her him him and he wants to know what your thoughts are on it

1821
02:21:08,620 --> 02:21:11,980
being from a different region if you want if you don't want to say anything

1822
02:21:11,980 --> 02:21:16,180
on the show you don't have to about what about the closures and how you feel and

1823
02:21:16,180 --> 02:21:24,580
about what might be happening being out of money sucks and stores closing sucks

1824
02:21:24,580 --> 02:21:30,780
and if more of you fuckers would shop there instead of going to GameStop maybe

1825
02:21:30,780 --> 02:21:36,700
we can stay no no it's not your guys's fault it's your guys's fault there's

1826
02:21:36,700 --> 02:21:40,860
really not a lot to say you know the economy's tough a lot of good people

1827
02:21:40,860 --> 02:21:46,860
have lost jobs a lot of good people are hanging on and Hollywood and movie

1828
02:21:46,860 --> 02:21:55,820
gallery really mismanaged through that on a corporate level I've dealt with

1829
02:21:55,820 --> 02:22:01,980
movie gallery and they're like exactly it's a company that like didn't catch on

1830
02:22:01,980 --> 02:22:07,140
to trends that were stupidly obvious ten years ago that they could have done to

1831
02:22:07,140 --> 02:22:12,180
avoid all this today and if you know if things have been done differently you

1832
02:22:12,180 --> 02:22:15,180
know what it could have should have yeah yeah yeah you know as far as it goes now

1833
02:22:15,180 --> 02:22:21,420
yeah it sucks that we're losing any competition for GameStop because

1834
02:22:21,420 --> 02:22:26,060
GameStop's already bigger and evil er than it needs to be and that's you guys

1835
02:22:26,060 --> 02:22:31,820
know that's true and that honestly enough that maybe if you know if if the

1836
02:22:31,820 --> 02:22:35,900
bankruptcy works out which it won't and any of the game crazies end up staying

1837
02:22:35,900 --> 02:22:40,340
open which they probably won't you know it would be really nice that the gamers

1838
02:22:40,340 --> 02:22:45,580
will still have an alternative but you know to anyone else who works for the

1839
02:22:45,580 --> 02:22:49,780
company hey I'm there with you it's rough I can't speak for them I'm gonna

1840
02:22:49,780 --> 02:22:54,220
show up every day I mean you know try to help my gamers and you know I recommend

1841
02:22:54,220 --> 02:22:58,420
they do the same if you have a game craze in your area and you haven't gone

1842
02:22:58,420 --> 02:23:04,500
there hey this is it while it's there give it a chance and you know hopefully

1843
02:23:04,500 --> 02:23:09,720
like it and if you don't go to hell maybe we should maybe we should do an

1844
02:23:09,720 --> 02:23:15,000
SOS campaign save our stores well I appreciate Dan's perspective because you

1845
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,580
know there's some people that when it comes to the day job they'd be like I

1846
02:23:17,580 --> 02:23:19,940
fucking touching that shit with a fucking ten-foot pole so I appreciate

1847
02:23:19,940 --> 02:23:25,900
you sweetie being openly and candidly on the topic thank you sweetie support not

1848
02:23:25,900 --> 02:23:29,260
just independent radio but support independent game stores even though game

1849
02:23:29,260 --> 02:23:32,640
crazy isn't necessarily independent it's important to point out they're not

1850
02:23:32,640 --> 02:23:37,440
Walmart and they're not GameStop so that's independent enough they're a

1851
02:23:37,440 --> 02:23:40,620
fucking endangered species yes that's right they're like they're like a

1852
02:23:40,620 --> 02:23:44,740
goddamn unicorn and I was close to independent kind that Loki's been

1861
02:24:38,980 --> 02:24:42,940

1870
02:25:18,300 --> 02:25:22,060
to do the F use of the week oh yeah we're still having them tonight just

1871
02:25:22,060 --> 02:25:27,820
because it's a fuck show doesn't mean we've got orange boxes is 1999 1799 news

1872
02:25:27,820 --> 02:25:32,620
we got a big story to inspire this tonight

1873
02:25:39,900 --> 02:25:43,660
as if the whole fucking reason for tonight's show weren't enough reason to

1874
02:25:43,660 --> 02:25:48,060
be angry let me give you a little something extra here a Korean couple

1875
02:25:48,060 --> 02:25:53,140
this week has made the news for neglecting their infant to the point

1876
02:25:53,140 --> 02:25:58,860
where the infant starved because they were addicted to online games at

1877
02:25:58,860 --> 02:26:02,580
internet cafes now you might want to take this with a grain of salt because

1878
02:26:02,580 --> 02:26:07,980
it's coming from the Sun but still sadly you could see it but I trust the Sun

1879
02:26:07,980 --> 02:26:12,140
with all of its sunlight in nutrients here's the irony they were raising a

1880
02:26:12,140 --> 02:26:17,100
virtual toddler in a game called Prius online it's pretty much second life but

1881
02:26:17,100 --> 02:26:20,620
while they were doing this they'd leave their real one at home alone each day

1882
02:26:20,620 --> 02:26:23,420
with just a bottle of milk for nourishment dude it's even worse than

1883
02:26:23,420 --> 02:26:27,900
Clara from the guild at least like she's sitting in the same room with them one

1884
02:26:27,900 --> 02:26:31,220
day they came home to find the child dead and called the cops claiming that

1885
02:26:31,220 --> 02:26:35,780
they found them dead went to found the kid dead when they woke up

1886
02:26:35,780 --> 02:26:40,340
investigators found though that the child was dehydrated and decided that

1887
02:26:40,340 --> 02:26:44,260
the couple story was full of bullshit good for them just pathetic this is all

1888
02:26:44,260 --> 02:26:52,140
disgusting honestly yeah I what else can you say this is just it's it's kind of

1889
02:26:52,140 --> 02:26:55,980
sad you don't have to take an IQ test to reproduce like some days I really wish

1890
02:26:55,980 --> 02:27:00,860
you had to take an IQ test in order to successfully have an orgasm oh I'm

1891
02:27:00,860 --> 02:27:09,460
almost there I'm almost there okay what's 2 plus 2 die forget no baby

1892
02:27:09,460 --> 02:27:13,620
anyhow if that doesn't inspire some angst within you then I don't know what

1893
02:27:13,620 --> 02:27:17,300
else well dark soccer what's your F use of the week fuck you ever hacked my Gaia

1894
02:27:17,300 --> 02:27:26,620
account um yeah I had about a million and cold stolen and some of my expensive

1895
02:27:26,620 --> 02:27:31,900
items and yeah I play on it as sort of like a little oh I'm wasting time thing

1896
02:27:31,900 --> 02:27:36,500
but it's just that it's just shitty you know and I want people to give me my

1897
02:27:36,500 --> 02:27:43,020
money back so it's just completely horrible that's really it though I mean

1898
02:27:43,020 --> 02:27:45,540
that and having no time to get my stuff finished

1899
02:27:45,540 --> 02:27:51,140
looky I'm tired so this isn't as heartfelt as it was the beginning of the

1900
02:27:51,140 --> 02:27:58,340
show but fuck you to the asshole that stole my 360 and my mod chip and my $60

1901
02:27:58,340 --> 02:28:04,580
that was gonna pay for installing the mod chip and wasting my entire day and

1902
02:28:04,580 --> 02:28:08,620
making me have to drive down to Stockton because Stockton sucks and having to

1903
02:28:08,620 --> 02:28:17,180
drive back from Stockton angry angry yes oh I was so pissed off and not only that

1904
02:28:17,180 --> 02:28:21,540
waiting four hours in a car in front of an apartment complex which I assumed was

1905
02:28:21,540 --> 02:28:27,140
his it might not be at this point I am going to email him this week though to

1906
02:28:27,140 --> 02:28:30,540
give him a chance maybe there was some misunderstanding maybe his phone fucked

1907
02:28:30,540 --> 02:28:35,540
up and he just didn't get any of my messages at the very end or maybe not or

1908
02:28:35,540 --> 02:28:38,900
maybe not but hey I'm gonna give him an opportunity to ship me that console if

1909
02:28:38,900 --> 02:28:42,140
he doesn't then we'll fucking post his email and his phone number all over the

1910
02:28:42,140 --> 02:28:47,140
internet so good fucking luck yeah he has an iPhone I know that he pissed off

1911
02:28:47,140 --> 02:28:51,820
a radio show host be warned I don't have a lot of F use this week I actually do

1912
02:28:51,820 --> 02:28:54,500
have a big F you but it's not one I want to stay on the show because it's a

1913
02:28:54,500 --> 02:29:01,100
sensitive matter so just F you to feeling underappreciated let's leave it

1914
02:29:01,100 --> 02:29:08,300
at that that's it for the F use more fuck show a couple of fucking stories

1915
02:29:08,300 --> 02:29:12,500
for you guys Loki what do you got on deck so apparently there's some fucking

1916
02:29:12,500 --> 02:29:19,100
new design for the DS cartridge that's come out in a patent filing it looks

1917
02:29:19,100 --> 02:29:22,940
like a new DS cartridge that's a little bit longer than the normal DS cartridge

1918
02:29:22,940 --> 02:29:26,940
it's got I don't even know looks like almost like a button or something on the

1919
02:29:26,940 --> 02:29:32,900
end of the cartridge there maybe either for like some sort of rewrite thing or

1920
02:29:32,900 --> 02:29:39,180
possibly God knows if you ask me because it's hard to tell based just off this

1921
02:29:39,180 --> 02:29:43,540
little picture but people are thinking that maybe it's some sort of expansion

1922
02:29:43,540 --> 02:29:48,460
device that they're making for the DSI or something like that to allow you know

1923
02:29:48,460 --> 02:29:53,340
other peripherals that you might use on say for example the Game Boy Advance

1924
02:29:53,340 --> 02:29:59,140
slot like maybe new guitar hero type thing this makes me think of what is the

1925
02:29:59,140 --> 02:30:03,740
rumble pack they put out for Pokemon pinball you know it kinda looks like to

1926
02:30:03,740 --> 02:30:07,220
me almost like some sort of wireless card or something like that but the DS

1927
02:30:07,220 --> 02:30:12,060
you already has wireless on it it's just that button on top you almost looks like

1928
02:30:12,060 --> 02:30:17,980
a sinker some sort of device maybe a motion controller type thing something

1929
02:30:17,980 --> 02:30:22,580
like that maybe the button resets you know the orientation or some shit like

1930
02:30:22,580 --> 02:30:27,380
that who knows we'll find out later on it when this actually comes out whatever

1931
02:30:27,380 --> 02:30:32,020
the hell it is that they're you know I don't know maybe around e3 sure it's

1932
02:30:32,020 --> 02:30:38,420
gonna suck my fucking out why you gotta be so fucking negative we relax the Wii

1933
02:30:38,420 --> 02:30:42,900
Vitality sensor mine that's why I gotta be fucking negative mine or the Wii

1934
02:30:42,900 --> 02:30:47,260
Zapper hey let's let's make this really cool controller attachment nope now

1935
02:30:47,260 --> 02:30:50,460
let's not let's just add a little plastic shell instead that looks like

1936
02:30:50,460 --> 02:30:57,860
shit on plays like shit it is shit all right I got one more fucking story for

1937
02:30:57,860 --> 02:31:01,180
you guys we're gonna open up the skype line a one eight seven seven game olr

1938
02:31:01,180 --> 02:31:04,340
our username on skype is orange launch radio the three-minute rules in effect

1939
02:31:04,340 --> 02:31:08,180
tonight phone calls will be limited to three minutes so that every fucking

1940
02:31:08,180 --> 02:31:12,500
gamer can have a voice tonight valve games are on their way to the Macintosh

1941
02:31:12,500 --> 02:31:17,300
that's right I guess there were some rumors about fucking steam going to the

1942
02:31:17,300 --> 02:31:20,820
Macintosh cuz some fucking files that were found in the latest beta build but

1943
02:31:20,820 --> 02:31:27,300
valve has basically hinted very strongly that the games are coming to the Mac I

1944
02:31:27,300 --> 02:31:31,620
guess Doug Lombardi the VP of marketing over at valve actually kind of gave the

1945
02:31:31,620 --> 02:31:37,540
official confirmation but no release dates or anything like that but it's a

1946
02:31:37,540 --> 02:31:42,940
pretty fucking understood that Team Fortress 2 Half-Life Left 4 Dead portal

1947
02:31:42,940 --> 02:31:47,060
those are all big big possibilities it should be noted Team Fortress 2 is used

1948
02:31:47,060 --> 02:31:51,100
in some type of little campaign there that is kind of a parody of the Apple

1949
02:31:51,100 --> 02:31:55,940
ads so some fucking Mac users are gonna be very fucking excited especially with

1950
02:31:55,940 --> 02:31:58,680
a game like portal and you know all those games really valve makes some

1951
02:31:58,680 --> 02:32:02,140
pretty fucking awesome games those are all gonna be worth playing yeah that's

1952
02:32:02,140 --> 02:32:06,860
what's that they're pretty cool yep so even Loki can support that on the Mac

1953
02:32:06,860 --> 02:32:10,780
more games for the Mac Loki that's all you ever wanted right I didn't want

1954
02:32:10,780 --> 02:32:13,580
anything for the Mac and I don't care that's why they want to release more

1955
02:32:13,580 --> 02:32:17,260
games to the Mac because there are people that buy those pcs I don't

1956
02:32:17,260 --> 02:32:23,180
understand why but whatever you know make the money where they can I just

1957
02:32:23,180 --> 02:32:26,660
want to share while Loki was reading his last fucking story I ran out to the

1958
02:32:26,660 --> 02:32:29,300
fucking car by the way the Skype lines open go ahead and call one eight seven

02:32:32,300 --> 02:32:36,460
chips which you become really fucking addicted to but this is a different

1961
02:32:36,460 --> 02:32:40,780
brand these are from Trader Joe's and these are reduced guilt because they're

1962
02:32:40,780 --> 02:32:45,100
not as fatty sea salt chips and I've gotten Jamie addicted to them yay oh no

1963
02:32:45,100 --> 02:32:49,220
I almost bought myself some not only is that the Stacy's brand is really good

1964
02:32:49,220 --> 02:32:51,860
but these are really good too these are almost better in some ways and they have

1965
02:32:51,860 --> 02:32:54,660
ones they have cinnamon and sugar ones at Trader Joe's too yes they do they

1966

fucking spazzinator it's been a long fucking time what's the latest with you

1970
02:33:12,620 --> 02:33:21,020
and Sony well you know at least in my fucking opinion this whole clock you

1971
02:33:21,020 --> 02:33:27,860
know fucking deal is you're putting another nail into the fucking coffin so

1972
02:33:27,860 --> 02:33:35,020
you know it just seems like fucking so you can't do anything right so but on a

1973
02:33:35,020 --> 02:33:42,740
positive note I did speak to Sony rep not too long ago and they gave me another

1974
02:33:42,740 --> 02:33:49,940
story saying that yeah once I send my system in they'll you know if they have

1975
02:33:49,940 --> 02:33:54,340
to send me another system they'll like reauthorize need to download all my

1976
02:33:54,340 --> 02:34:00,780
videos well that's what that being said I'm sorry did you start to say something

1977
02:34:00,780 --> 02:34:04,100
there no I was just gonna say at least they're offering that that seems like

1978
02:34:04,100 --> 02:34:10,260
fucking more than you got before yeah well even with that being said I still

1979
02:34:10,260 --> 02:34:16,780
say yeah pretty much fucking sucks you know I mean you know no one should have

1980
02:34:16,780 --> 02:34:21,540
to go through this kind of be out every single time you know something goes up

1981
02:34:21,540 --> 02:34:27,140
and it goes down you know I mean no like you know like I mentioned time and time

1982
02:34:27,140 --> 02:34:32,780
before you know I'm so of a big Sony fan of as you mentioned I tend to pimp out

1983
02:34:32,780 --> 02:34:38,140
you know this they have a dollar on your show fucking PSN is in your fucking

1984

fair you give Sony a bad time when they deserve it and it's kind of sad that

1987
02:34:49,660 --> 02:34:55,780
Sony would be um no pissing off a loyal fan like you yeah yeah in fact there's

1988
02:34:55,780 --> 02:35:00,260
thanks for our question why I even bother with Sony you know you know

1989
02:35:00,260 --> 02:35:06,500

1990
02:35:06,500 --> 02:35:14,020
give Sony the finger you know but hopefully everything in the long run

2001
02:36:01,980 --> 02:36:05,900
pain in the ass why can't things just work why can't electronics just work you

minute stories to fucking get out there oh wait I got another call hold on one

2004
02:36:13,760 --> 02:36:17,800
minute dark soccer I'll let you jump in right after this call you're on the

2005
02:36:17,800 --> 02:36:22,360
Orange Lounge Radio fuck show who's this I was like a soccer who watching the

2006
02:36:22,360 --> 02:36:29,700
Oscars and doing this at the same time fuck the Oscars bunch of sucking each

2007
02:36:29,700 --> 02:36:33,140
other's dicks with these awards we all know it's gonna win doesn't fucking

2008
02:36:33,140 --> 02:36:36,580
matter they bumped it up to ten movies it's a two-movie race anyway all right

2009
02:36:36,580 --> 02:36:40,780
what's on your mind tonight I guess the the word fuck could probably apply to

2010
02:36:40,780 --> 02:36:46,660
someone probably some entity deserves a case-to-point Activision ha ha yes our

2011
02:36:46,660 --> 02:36:52,420
bad that happened recently what's your take on the whole fucking thing huh

2012
02:36:52,420 --> 02:36:57,340
what's your take on the whole fucking thing um I think I knew it was it was on

2013
02:36:57,340 --> 02:37:01,620
its way I think I knew was gonna happen it was a matter of when I mean the

2014
02:37:01,620 --> 02:37:06,700
writing was on the wall when infinity Ward was you know actually nixed the

2015
02:37:06,700 --> 02:37:10,980
dedicated servers modern warfare 2 you knew that is something that they

2016
02:37:10,980 --> 02:37:16,580
probably didn't want to do but they had someone's hand probably forced them so

2017
02:37:16,580 --> 02:37:24,420
it's kind of in other words the way I see it is that I don't know I guess

2018
02:37:24,420 --> 02:37:30,260
Activision is trying to bring forth the you know the great video game crash that

2019
02:37:30,260 --> 02:37:35,060
almost happened but never did are you talking about the one that happened in

2020
02:37:35,060 --> 02:37:40,580
the 80s because that really didn't happen it just you know the way you see

2021
02:37:40,580 --> 02:37:46,140
it is that you had you have a company that's um that's literally saturating

2022
02:37:46,140 --> 02:37:50,300
the market basically trying to bleed everything you know try to get all their

2023
02:37:50,300 --> 02:37:56,660
franchises dry and just like minimizing minimizing the amount of the amount of

2024
02:37:56,660 --> 02:38:01,460
properties that I sustain them in other words if if it only comes down to Tony

2025
02:38:01,460 --> 02:38:05,700
Hawk Hall of Duty Guitar Hero bringing bringing their only bird and butter

2026
02:38:05,700 --> 02:38:08,940
that's kind of dangerous I don't know if it's gonna cause another fucking video

2027
02:38:08,940 --> 02:38:14,020
game crash though I mean there's so many other reasons I mean you you get to the

2028
02:38:14,020 --> 02:38:19,620
point where we're guitar heroes you know it's pretty much pan no matter what what

2029
02:38:19,620 --> 02:38:22,220
new release comes out because they already know it's gonna be the same

2030
02:38:22,220 --> 02:38:26,420
thing same dribble it's not gonna be worth the effort I mean the last to

2031
02:38:26,420 --> 02:38:31,260
prove that point and when Tony Hawk you know Tony Hawk ride pretty much bombed

2032
02:38:31,260 --> 02:38:35,660
for all intents and purposes it goes to show that they're they're not innovating

2033
02:38:35,660 --> 02:38:39,020
we're just we're just releasing the same thing and trying to nickel and dime

2034
02:38:39,020 --> 02:38:44,020
people no innovation more renovation I think they try to innovate it's just it

2035
02:38:44,020 --> 02:38:49,020
sucked it's just the fact that they're not trying anything original like EA

2036
02:38:49,020 --> 02:38:52,820
based EA learning they're there they learn their lesson already that's why

2037
02:38:52,820 --> 02:38:57,980
so you see mirrors edge dead space Mass Effect because they're actually

2038
02:38:57,980 --> 02:39:04,060
realizing that you can't you can't you can't milk the same same cow over and

2039
02:39:04,060 --> 02:39:07,940
over and expect the the same result it just came down to where they they

2040
02:39:07,940 --> 02:39:11,780
basically had their control system in place and it worked okay for Tony Hawk

2041
02:39:11,780 --> 02:39:16,060
and then skate came out and had a slightly better control system that's

2042
02:39:16,060 --> 02:39:21,140
where EA basically knew how to innovate they found they found a way to create a

2043
02:39:21,140 --> 02:39:27,140
skateboarding game that was outside of the of the status quo outside of what

2044
02:39:27,140 --> 02:39:32,980
what Tony Hawk is offered so you see right there when you when you feel to

2045
02:39:32,980 --> 02:39:36,220
innovate the only thing you have is whatever you you know whatever you're

2046
02:39:36,220 --> 02:39:40,300
able to market and whatever you're able to litigate all right I got to jump in

2047
02:39:40,300 --> 02:39:42,740
and call time on the call because we're on three minute limit tonight but thank

2048
02:39:42,740 --> 02:39:49,420
you Zaku as always for your perspective all right great night later we do

2049
02:39:49,420 --> 02:39:53,020
appreciate Zaku's perspective and a gold fucking star for Zaku I did not hear much

2050
02:39:53,020 --> 02:39:57,900
bam bam bamming on the keyboard and I heard little little taps but no worse

2051
02:39:57,900 --> 02:40:03,900
than when Jamie points the mic at her keyboard all right love you mean it all

2052
02:40:03,900 --> 02:40:06,820
right Jamie you had a last-minute story for us tonight speaking of which while

2053
02:40:06,820 --> 02:40:10,380
we wait for another call at eight seven seven game olr on our fuck show I did

2054
02:40:10,380 --> 02:40:15,980
and it was oh geez sounds awfully loud I didn't it was when actually that our

2055
02:40:15,980 --> 02:40:20,580
good friend Martin left posted today and I thought it was really neat so I'm

2056
02:40:20,580 --> 02:40:31,340
going to share it um there is a there was a report that is about a guy named

2057
02:40:31,340 --> 02:40:38,340
Roy Williams who played through ocarina of time blindfolded to write a guide on

2058
02:40:38,340 --> 02:40:47,340
how to play the game only by using using sound clues so that a visually impaired

2059
02:40:47,340 --> 02:40:54,900
player could beat the game and so him and three other guys took two years to

2060
02:40:54,900 --> 02:41:03,140
write this but Jordan Verner who was living in Ontario beat the game isn't

2061
02:41:03,140 --> 02:41:08,460
that nice yeah that's it's cool and you know I know we have some blind gamers

2062
02:41:08,460 --> 02:41:13,860
listen to this show that you know often kind of talk about you know using the

2063
02:41:13,860 --> 02:41:16,860
kind of the sound cues in the games and being able to kind of play the games

2064
02:41:16,860 --> 02:41:20,060
that way and I think that's cool that people kind of go out of their way to

2065
02:41:20,060 --> 02:41:25,340
write things with sound cues and so forth and these FAQs so that everybody

2066
02:41:25,340 --> 02:41:28,300
can really enjoy video games in one way or another so I think it's a great story

2067
02:41:28,300 --> 02:41:32,660
okay we got more calls coming in sorry we've been ignoring the lines for a

2068
02:41:32,660 --> 02:41:35,140
little bit but let's go to another call hi you're on the orange ons radio fuck

2069
02:41:35,140 --> 02:41:39,540
show who's this it's about fucking time guys well really fucking sorry what's

2070
02:41:39,540 --> 02:41:44,380
your fucking name my fucking name is Ron mo from the New York OL army fucker all

2071
02:41:44,380 --> 02:41:47,660
right three fucking minutes what's on your fucking mind tonight dude I want to

2072
02:41:47,660 --> 02:41:57,900
know what the fuck is up with FF 13 what do you mean the black guy is sassy okay

2073
02:41:57,900 --> 02:42:06,340
so we both listen this sassy was one of the the adjectives I thought of when I

2074
02:42:06,340 --> 02:42:11,660
was playing the game too and I'm less in I'm sorry it's just that's he just comes

2075
02:42:11,660 --> 02:42:15,540
out kind of sassy you know you have to admit I'm a Barrett was kind of a little

2076
02:42:15,540 --> 02:42:20,060
bit fucking sassy too but it was freaking hardcore that yeah that was a

2077
02:42:20,060 --> 02:42:26,140
badass saws is sassy in a different way like dude Rama he has a fucking chocobo

2078
02:42:26,140 --> 02:42:30,460
living in his fucking afro I mean come on but there is you sense that there is

2079
02:42:30,460 --> 02:42:33,940
like again I don't want to give story spoilers but you sense that there is a

2080
02:42:33,940 --> 02:42:39,660
definitely deeper story to him he's not just completely transparent comic relief

2081
02:42:39,660 --> 02:42:44,300
they never they never Jansen Jansen was kind of sassy and lost Odyssey well they

2082
02:42:44,300 --> 02:42:48,380
never explained right away at least where I'm at why he's even with them

2083
02:42:48,380 --> 02:42:53,700
right now yeah but flashbacks will tell you a little later yes so it's all lost

2084
02:42:53,700 --> 02:42:59,540
style remember so but easy he's a little bit sassy I it's better than Rama you

2085
02:42:59,540 --> 02:43:03,380
after he's actually I will say he is my favorite character in the game right now

2086
02:43:03,380 --> 02:43:08,040
because everybody else is in my opinion kind of such a stereotype of the Final

2087
02:43:08,040 --> 02:43:12,260
Fantasy 7 characters in a way yeah yeah like I really I like him I think he's

2088
02:43:12,260 --> 02:43:16,900
really interesting in the chocobo in the afro is so fucking adorable like I see

2089
02:43:16,900 --> 02:43:21,620
like RuPaul sassy or just no no he's not like cheeky he's not like bitch you

2090
02:43:21,620 --> 02:43:25,200
better work he's just the calm is he cheeky a little bit he's a little bit

2091
02:43:25,200 --> 02:43:31,380
cheeky cheeky he's a little bit cheeky so sorry when you say sassy I think of

2092
02:43:31,380 --> 02:43:35,100
your sassy pants no that's a whole different kind I know but that makes me

2093
02:43:35,100 --> 02:43:40,460
think though of like RuPaul I don't know why but RuPaul makes me think sassy and

2094
02:43:40,460 --> 02:43:46,540
Tyra he does say and I had to laugh because of the lethal rep lethal weapon

2095
02:43:46,540 --> 02:43:53,900
reference I'm getting too old for this he does he does that no one is gonna

2096
02:43:53,900 --> 02:43:59,580
ever top Sid for the attitude sit your ass down in the chair and drink your

2097
02:43:59,580 --> 02:44:05,100
goddamn tea but Rama yeah be happy because I think they actually have a

2098
02:44:05,100 --> 02:44:11,580
black guy doing his voice well I will soon find out because I don't know if

2099
02:44:11,580 --> 02:44:16,580
you guys realize cuz Otacon is in a few fucking months and guess who's going to

2100
02:44:16,580 --> 02:44:21,620
have to cosplay this guy you are yes everyone's like you have to cosplay this

2123
02:46:05,540 --> 02:46:13,380
done to save itself gotten someone who is more skilled in marketing I guess

2124
02:46:13,380 --> 02:46:19,340
someone that could have said you know hey when it comes to porting or whatnot

2125
02:46:19,340 --> 02:46:27,260
you know the PlayStation 2 kind of isn't so good on this so you know our port of

2217
02:54:57,180 --> 02:55:02,100
sex link hey how the fuck are you a lot better than I have been during the

2218
02:55:02,100 --> 02:55:05,340
beginning of week when I got 22 in my teeth pulled oh my gosh that's right I

2219

well you're talking now you sound pretty good so everything's better well well

2221
02:55:14,500 --> 02:55:17,820
I'm talking good right now because I don't have the dentures and I don't keep

2222
02:55:17,820 --> 02:55:22,660
them in 24-7 sighs well it's kind of hard at first I was drooling for a first

2223
02:55:22,660 --> 02:55:26,900
couple days looking like a fucking idiot but you know hey you know you live you

2224
02:55:26,900 --> 02:55:30,980
learn you do it very slowly so you know and it got me a lot of time to catch up

2225
02:55:30,980 --> 02:55:34,860
on a few games and such so I had a friend that had to have that done kind

2226
02:55:34,860 --> 02:55:39,540
of young like in the early 20s so it happens so all right well what's on your

2227
02:55:39,540 --> 02:55:44,060
mind you're not excellent um nothing much you know it's great to hear that

2228
02:55:44,060 --> 02:55:47,780
the DRM is finally cracked so this way during hurricane season I could sit down

2229
02:55:47,780 --> 02:55:52,060
with my laptop and play Assassin's Creed 2 and not worry about being connected

2230
02:55:52,060 --> 02:55:57,980
on to a fucking internet fee 24-7 so because you know it's a lot of times you

2231
02:55:57,980 --> 02:56:01,020
know during those down times it's good to sit there with a laptop and play a

2232
02:56:01,020 --> 02:56:05,860
couple games and get caught back up so you know and also the ps2 thing is I

2233
02:56:05,860 --> 02:56:09,580
have my ps2 fat I got the one the originals sing right across from me

2234
02:56:09,580 --> 02:56:13,300
still works perfectly after all these years with a bunch of my games still

2235
02:56:13,300 --> 02:56:17,540
going through so I mean you know how they get ps2 nothing but love for that

2236
02:56:17,540 --> 02:56:21,860
so I mean system that doesn't break or you know go down for two and a half days

2237
02:56:21,860 --> 02:56:29,500
you know when there's certain leap year issues with other consoles so you know

2238
02:56:29,500 --> 02:56:34,180
nice I like though that we kind of get the back-to-back calls about you know

2239
02:56:34,180 --> 02:56:38,980
ps2 love versus ps2 hate it's it's it's kind of cool not not hate just you know

2240
02:56:38,980 --> 02:56:43,580
well you know there's a shitload of games for ps2 right now I'm still going

2241
02:56:43,580 --> 02:56:47,380
through I mean I I came and started sitting here and tell you how many games

2242
02:56:47,380 --> 02:56:50,100
I got to go through for the ps2 I'm sitting right across I haven't even

2243
02:56:50,100 --> 02:56:54,980
touched or I went halfway through and you know and and you know and I still

2244
02:56:54,980 --> 02:56:57,580
have a lot of them and I'm planning on going through them before I even

2245
02:56:57,580 --> 02:57:01,780
consider to get a ps3 or anything like that because you know that's gonna be

2246
02:57:01,780 --> 02:57:07,900
more on my list so I mean you know between that my PSP and my PC games I'm

2247
02:57:07,900 --> 02:57:11,740
pretty much set for probably about almost a year give or take it it does

2248

have one of the fucking largest libraries of video games just ever and

2249
02:57:15,420 --> 02:57:18,460
it's not stopping you know if you listen to Japanese release days there is still

2250
02:57:18,460 --> 02:57:22,020
fucking shit coming out for it now so it's yeah but unfortunately the American

2251
02:57:22,020 --> 02:57:27,380
version though is slowing down though yeah it depends the type of games you're

2252
02:57:27,380 --> 02:57:33,900
into they always be some fucking poker game coming out no actually like a poker

2253
02:57:33,900 --> 02:57:37,460

2254
02:57:37,460 --> 02:57:40,940
last poker game we had come out no the last few games we had come out on

2255

2256
02:57:44,740 --> 02:57:48,940

of the Rings Aragon's quest you know Lord of the Rings for kids and yeah that's

2259
02:58:01,900 --> 02:58:05,100
pretty much that's it unless you're talking about maybe a few EA games but

2260
02:58:05,100 --> 02:58:10,220
even EA cutting them out now for sports stuff at least maybe Madden probably

2261

2262

2263
02:58:16,980 --> 02:58:20,140

2268
02:58:32,380 --> 02:58:35,980
you have to send us a fucking email mailbag at orange lounge radio.com I know

2269
02:58:35,980 --> 02:58:39,100
Loki's been fucking waiting to do some last-minute fucking stories right yeah

2270
02:58:39,100 --> 02:58:44,500
sure all right there's there's some interesting information apparently

2271
02:58:44,500 --> 02:58:48,060
Batman Arkham Asylum is getting the game of the year edition which was supposed

2272
02:58:48,060 --> 02:58:51,740
to be coming out over in the US and as far as I'm aware still is coming out

2273
02:58:51,740 --> 02:58:55,260
over in the US unless they well they've already answered they're not but

2274
02:58:55,260 --> 02:58:58,420
whatever anyways what's kind of neat about the game of the year edition though

2275
02:58:58,420 --> 02:59:04,620
if you may already have you know the version of the game you will actually be

2276
02:59:04,620 --> 02:59:08,980
able to play this game in stereoscopic 3d that's right it's gonna come with 3d

2277
02:59:08,980 --> 02:59:15,860
glasses and apparently use a technology called a tri-oviz 3d that will allow you

2278
02:59:15,860 --> 02:59:20,460
to view the game in 3d and doesn't rely on red and blue lenses meaning the

2279
02:59:20,460 --> 02:59:25,540
colors are preserved and apparently will work with HD and standard definition sets

2280
02:59:25,540 --> 02:59:30,340
which you know if that works now I think they should that sounds like a good idea

2281
02:59:30,340 --> 02:59:35,460
it sounds cheap speaking of good ideas coming from Warner Brothers okay well I'm

2282
02:59:35,460 --> 02:59:41,700
being sarcastic here they're in talks now to produce a space invaders movie

2283
02:59:41,700 --> 02:59:47,020
yes the movie industry has run out of ideas well at least they could do

2284
02:59:47,020 --> 02:59:49,780
whatever the fuck they wanted I mean it's like there's this big fucking plot

2285
02:59:49,780 --> 02:59:55,660
to space invaders aliens are invading earth shoot them Wow yes the space

2286
02:59:55,660 --> 03:00:01,580
invaders apparently the they're speculating that the film will be a big

2287
03:00:01,580 --> 03:00:11,580
bucked a big-budget action blockbuster held by some prolific director Sony has

2288
03:00:11,580 --> 03:00:16,580
filed us some patents for game demos apparently that will lose feature over

2289
03:00:16,580 --> 03:00:23,580
time which I have to say is the worst idea ever can't just fucking redownload

2290
03:00:23,580 --> 03:00:28,220
it well maybe you won't be able to maybe it's gonna be like those time trials you

2291
03:00:28,220 --> 03:00:31,140
know on the windows and stuff like that and why should I have to fucking

2292
03:00:31,140 --> 03:00:36,180
redownload say if I want to show a demo I play demo say for a game that you may

2293
03:00:36,180 --> 03:00:39,460
not be getting the lot of press or whatever and I want to show my friends

2294
03:00:39,460 --> 03:00:43,580
like for example wet wet I thought the demo was fucking awesome and I show my

2295
03:00:43,580 --> 03:00:47,660
friends and they got excited about it if I have to play the game again and the

2296
03:00:47,660 --> 03:00:51,340
features are removed that's gonna be pretty disappointing well it was cool

2297
03:00:51,340 --> 03:00:54,860
the first time I played it well what you have to do is you have to make another

2298
03:00:54,860 --> 03:01:06,260
PlayStation profile and have your friend sign in to play no apparently Ubisoft is

2299
03:01:06,260 --> 03:01:11,340
looking to take on Tony Hawk which shouldn't be too difficult at this point

2300
03:01:11,340 --> 03:01:16,380
and they're gonna put out Sean White skateboarding yes Sean White

2301
03:01:16,380 --> 03:01:20,860
apparently skateboards as well and unfortunately though in the screenshot

2302
03:01:20,860 --> 03:01:26,220
they have of Sean White snowboarding looks like a Geico caveman so I don't

2303
03:01:26,220 --> 03:01:29,300
know what's going on there because he certainly doesn't look like a Geico

2304
03:01:29,300 --> 03:01:36,380
caveman normally and yes so they're gonna be releasing that game apparently

2305
03:01:36,380 --> 03:01:40,820
and most likely on the Wii because that's where the last one came test

2306
03:01:40,820 --> 03:01:46,060
drive unlimited is getting a sequel coming out apparently this fall and to

2307
03:01:46,060 --> 03:01:52,380
playstation 3 Xbox 360 and PC and apparently the sequel will also have new

2308
03:01:52,380 --> 03:01:56,980
elements including day night cycles weather effects and vehicle damage and

2309
03:01:56,980 --> 03:02:01,460
hopefully the cops will figure out how to chase you down when you drive off the

2310
03:02:01,460 --> 03:02:06,340
road apparently our chatters are not big fans of my Muppet voice which I guess is

2311
03:02:06,340 --> 03:02:11,540
what that is let's see fucking Shahran and chat says so his next show the

2312

The O.L.R. Muppet Show is all about moi.

2320
03:02:53,760 --> 03:02:55,760
Wow, I fucking made Loki shut the fuck up.

2321
03:02:55,760 --> 03:03:00,760
No, I'm just rolling my eyes, and unfortunately you can't hear that on the radio.

2322
03:03:01,760 --> 03:03:03,760
Alright. Um...

2323
03:03:04,760 --> 03:03:06,760
I don't know, you people.

2324
03:03:06,760 --> 03:03:07,760
Yes, you do.

2325
03:03:07,760 --> 03:03:08,760
I'm hiding.

2326
03:03:08,760 --> 03:03:10,760
You're my BFF. Alright.

2327
03:03:10,760 --> 03:03:11,760
I know, Rob.

2328
03:03:11,760 --> 03:03:17,760
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts tonight, because believe it or not, we're at the end of the fucking show.

2329
03:03:17,760 --> 03:03:19,760
I hope you enjoyed your fucking selves tonight.

2330
03:03:19,760 --> 03:03:22,760
Uh, it was a pretty fucking good time, and I'm sure we said the F word a lot.

2331
03:03:22,760 --> 03:03:26,760
I don't... Maybe we'll get a count after the podcast goes out. I don't fucking know. We'll see.

2332
03:03:26,760 --> 03:03:28,760
I didn't put a lot of fucking effort into it, unfortunately.

2333
03:03:28,760 --> 03:03:31,760
That's alright. At the beginning of the show, it had a lot more fucks in the end. It was a...

2334
03:03:31,760 --> 03:03:33,760
You get tired after a while.

2335
03:03:33,760 --> 03:03:41,760
You do. You do. But it's... I would say you almost have to have more intelligence to be able to incorporate the word fuck into your fucking sentences for a long period of time.

2336
03:03:41,760 --> 03:03:43,760
It takes some fucking creativity to do that.

2337
03:03:43,760 --> 03:03:44,760
So...

2338
03:03:44,760 --> 03:03:49,760
Alright. Um, thank you guys very fucking much for tuning in and supporting independent fucking radio.

2339
03:03:49,760 --> 03:03:55,760
We really fucking appreciate your support, and if you fucking like what you fucking heard, please go give us a really fucking nice review on fucking iTunes.

2340
03:03:55,760 --> 03:03:57,760
We really like five-star fucking reviews.

2341
03:03:57,760 --> 03:04:03,760
Uh, it doesn't just have to fucking be on iTunes, though. Just tell a fucking friend, you know, in real life. Project Real Life, right?

2342
03:04:03,760 --> 03:04:08,760
Tell some fucking friends what you heard on Orange Honch fucking radio, and, uh, tell friends to listen to shows.

2343
03:04:08,760 --> 03:04:12,760
But you might want to not have them fucking start with this episode.

2344
03:04:12,760 --> 03:04:17,760
Like, this should be, like, maybe the fourth episode you listen to. Don't have this be somebody's fucking first episode.

2345
03:04:17,760 --> 03:04:21,760
But just tell your fucking friends. Word of mouth. That's all we fucking got, because we're an independent fucking podcast.

2346
03:04:21,760 --> 03:04:22,760
Aw, yeah.

2347
03:04:22,760 --> 03:04:26,760
Um, that's it. Let's go around and hear everybody's fucking final thought tonight.

2348
03:04:26,760 --> 03:04:28,760
DarkSakura, what's your fucking final thought?

2349
03:04:28,760 --> 03:04:31,760
Uh, fuck.

2350
03:04:31,760 --> 03:04:33,760
Loki, your fucking final thought tonight?

2351
03:04:33,760 --> 03:04:45,760
Uh, we'll have to see where this thing goes with this guy ripping me off. Um, I don't know. It's, it's very annoying.

2352
03:04:45,760 --> 03:04:50,760
And my fucking final thought tonight is sassafras.

2353
03:04:50,760 --> 03:04:55,760
Good night, everybody. Have a great week. We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.

2354
03:04:55,760 --> 03:04:57,760
P.S. Fuck.

2355
03:05:25,760 --> 03:05:28,760
See you next week.
