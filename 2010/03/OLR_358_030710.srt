1
00:00:00,069 --> 00:00:06,473
[SPEAKER_13]: Tonight, March 7th, 2010, we get first impressions on Final Fantasy XIII.

2
00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:17,701
[SPEAKER_17]: One of our favorite games is patched with teasers of a sequel, and the Rock Band Network goes live.

3
00:00:46,545 --> 00:00:56,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I come bearing a message from President Cat Here in California, home of Silicon Valley, home of video games We are in a budget crisis

4
00:00:57,481 --> 00:01:01,463
[SPEAKER_04]: State employees are furloughed, meaning we can't go to the DMV most Fridays.

5
00:01:02,344 --> 00:01:06,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Students are protesting out on the freeways amidst high tuition cutbacks.

6
00:01:06,926 --> 00:01:15,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Yet somehow our legislatures found the time last week to pass a resolution supporting anti-cussing week to take place this very week.

7
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:16,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

8
00:01:34,557 --> 00:01:44,043
[SPEAKER_04]: However, substituting words like oh pickles and sassafras, which have all of the same intent, is somehow okay and makes you a smarter person.

9
00:01:45,404 --> 00:01:48,626
[SPEAKER_04]: As residents of the state of California, we reject this notion.

10
00:01:49,627 --> 00:01:56,852
[SPEAKER_04]: As intelligent individuals, we take offense to the notion that using versatile swear words somehow demonstrates a lack of intelligence.

11
00:01:57,793 --> 00:02:04,057
[SPEAKER_04]: As free citizens of the United States of America living under the First Amendment, we say fuck yeah to free speech.

12
00:02:05,137 --> 00:02:12,942
[SPEAKER_04]: We will work tonight in protest of No Cussing Week to break the record for most uses of the F word on an internet podcast.

13
00:02:13,582 --> 00:02:20,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight, on a very special Orange Lounge Radio, we bring you The Fuck Show.

14
00:02:22,847 --> 00:02:25,929
America!

15
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:28,871
America!

16
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:30,152
[SPEAKER_11]: America!

17
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:30,992
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck yeah!

18
00:02:31,052 --> 00:02:33,874
[SPEAKER_11]: Come and if you have to save the motherfucker

19
00:02:39,452 --> 00:02:41,054
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

20
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:10,913
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just fucking annoyed at people feeling like they have to defend their own fucking opinion every fucking time someone says something that's different from them.

21
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:11,673
[SPEAKER_07]: So fuck them.

22
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:13,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really fuck them, but just fuck in general.

23
00:03:14,034 --> 00:03:14,934
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, just fuck them.

24
00:03:14,954 --> 00:03:15,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Right in their fucking ears.

25
00:03:16,515 --> 00:03:20,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, say hello to the one and only, he is so fucking smart, Tech Master Loki!

26
00:03:21,157 --> 00:03:22,378
[SPEAKER_04]: I keep fucking coughing.

27
00:03:22,918 --> 00:03:24,199
[SPEAKER_19]: I wish this fucking gold would go away.

28
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:26,560
[SPEAKER_19]: You have been fucking sick for like three fucking weeks now.

29
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,901
[SPEAKER_19]: I haven't been coughing all day long, but then all of a sudden this fucking coughing started after I ate all my chicken.

30
00:03:31,102 --> 00:03:31,582
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you like some tea?

31
00:03:32,522 --> 00:03:33,983
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I really hate fucking tea.

32
00:03:34,604 --> 00:03:35,465
[SPEAKER_19]: Tea is awful.

33
00:03:37,026 --> 00:03:38,427
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I think it's the root beer.

34
00:03:38,787 --> 00:03:41,509
[SPEAKER_19]: And while delicious the root beer was, it makes me cough.

35
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:42,790
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's not good.

36
00:03:43,351 --> 00:03:44,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you allergic to fucking root beer?

37
00:03:44,832 --> 00:03:46,053
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I am not allergic to root beer.

38
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:46,774
[SPEAKER_19]: Root beer is awesome.

39
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:52,318
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just, you know, the carbonation or whatever kind of loosens the fucking phlegm in my throat.

40
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:53,619
[SPEAKER_19]: So, it sucks.

41
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,741
[SPEAKER_19]: But yeah, otherwise I'm fine.

42
00:03:56,521 --> 00:03:57,062
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm fucking great.

43
00:03:57,462 --> 00:03:58,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, glad to hear it.

44
00:03:59,043 --> 00:04:03,627
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, folks, we do have some gaming news to get into a little later.

45
00:04:03,707 --> 00:04:09,471
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, we always fucking start off the show talking about our fucking gaming weeks, like anybody really gives a fuck what we've been playing.

46
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:11,712
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's just how you do a video game podcast.

47
00:04:11,732 --> 00:04:14,054
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been doing it a very fucking long time, about eight years.

48
00:04:14,294 --> 00:04:17,076
[SPEAKER_04]: So we used to start a little segment called How was your day?

49
00:04:17,116 --> 00:04:17,676
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your week?

50
00:04:17,736 --> 00:04:18,977
[SPEAKER_04]: But no one really gave a shit.

51
00:04:19,037 --> 00:04:21,959
[SPEAKER_04]: So we evolved it to fucking video games.

52
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,961
[SPEAKER_04]: So how the fuck was your gaming week, DarkSakra?

53
00:04:24,284 --> 00:04:25,365
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fucking boring.

54
00:04:26,186 --> 00:04:30,509
[SPEAKER_07]: I played Star Trek Online and made it to Lieutenant Commander, finally, fuck yeah.

55
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:37,434
[SPEAKER_07]: And a guy, this weird Klingon chick and a Bajoran dude, but fuck him.

56
00:04:38,415 --> 00:04:41,437
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's about all.

57
00:04:41,818 --> 00:04:42,518
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't do fuck all.

58
00:04:44,179 --> 00:04:44,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

59
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,301
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more fucking Star Trek Online.

60
00:04:46,341 --> 00:04:48,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Same fucking story every fucking week, but that's alright.

61
00:04:48,763 --> 00:04:50,664
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it's like to be fucking addicted to an MMO.

62
00:04:50,845 --> 00:04:51,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I should know.

63
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:52,552
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not addicted.

64
00:04:52,612 --> 00:04:53,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you.

65
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:54,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, sorry.

66
00:04:54,813 --> 00:04:56,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe not fucking addicted.

67
00:04:56,594 --> 00:04:58,134
[SPEAKER_07]: I set a day.

68
00:04:59,314 --> 00:05:00,875
[SPEAKER_07]: A day that is my fuck off day.

69
00:05:01,575 --> 00:05:02,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Where I do fuck all.

70
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,997
[SPEAKER_07]: But play my damn game and fuck around on the internet.

71
00:05:07,017 --> 00:05:08,337
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's good to have a fuck off day.

72
00:05:08,597 --> 00:05:10,318
[SPEAKER_04]: I have fuck off days on days ending in one.

73
00:05:10,358 --> 00:05:11,618
[SPEAKER_07]: I've actually started a project.

74
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,820
[SPEAKER_07]: A fantastic fucking project that doesn't involve fucking, by the way.

75
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Called Project Real Life.

76
00:05:21,078 --> 00:05:31,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Where this thing, this evil box, this fucking whore of a computer gets turned off How the fuck are you able to function?

77
00:05:31,551 --> 00:05:39,561
[SPEAKER_19]: But you're fucking playing the game in real life So I don't understand what the fucking point is I'm paying attention to my own fucking real life

78
00:05:41,687 --> 00:05:42,507
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, fuck me then.

79
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:44,248
[SPEAKER_04]: No, thank you.

80
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:45,208
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

81
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:47,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, how the fuck was your gaming week?

82
00:05:47,769 --> 00:05:51,210
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, let's talk about how awesome my gaming week was.

83
00:05:52,171 --> 00:05:52,471
[SPEAKER_19]: No, wait.

84
00:05:52,491 --> 00:05:54,131
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's talk about how awful today was.

85
00:05:54,272 --> 00:05:55,272
[SPEAKER_19]: Today was a fucking mess.

86
00:05:56,477 --> 00:05:58,158
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

87
00:06:14,651 --> 00:06:15,712
[SPEAKER_19]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

88
00:06:43,864 --> 00:06:47,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Stockton would kind of be, it's kind of like between the asshole and the balls.

89
00:06:48,345 --> 00:06:52,146
[SPEAKER_04]: So Stockton is kind of the fucking taint of California.

90
00:06:52,426 --> 00:06:54,006
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's nothing on the way.

91
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:55,026
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's not pleasurable.

92
00:06:55,406 --> 00:06:56,347
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just cow country.

93
00:06:56,427 --> 00:06:58,827
[SPEAKER_19]: Fucking shitty smelling cow country.

94
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:04,548
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyways, so I decided, okay, mind you, I woke up at 730 this morning.

95
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:06,369
[SPEAKER_19]: That's fucking early on a Sunday.

96
00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:08,569
[SPEAKER_19]: I drove all the way down there.

97
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:18,744
[SPEAKER_19]: Met the guy just before 9, gave him my console, paid him the $60 it would be to solder in the chip that I wanted him to solder in.

98
00:07:19,185 --> 00:07:21,368
[SPEAKER_19]: Told me it would take about 30-45 minutes.

99
00:07:23,823 --> 00:07:41,808
[SPEAKER_19]: Four hours later, waiting in fucking Stockton, the guy's not returning any of my text messages, he's not returning any of my phone calls, and so I'm fucking sitting there going, okay, well, I guess I'm either gonna fucking sit here all day, or I'm gonna have to fucking leave and leave my console behind and assume that I'm getting ripped off.

100
00:07:41,908 --> 00:07:43,028
[SPEAKER_19]: So, that's what happened.

101
00:07:43,108 --> 00:07:44,549
[SPEAKER_19]: I got fucking ripped off, apparently.

102
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:45,489
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, fuck him.

103
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:47,510
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, fuck him indeed.

104
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:58,238
[SPEAKER_19]: And so I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt for now and assume that this really was a mistake and his phone is all fucked up or whatever.

105
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:06,104
[SPEAKER_19]: And so I will be polite and contact him by email, giving him the opportunity to fucking ship me my console.

106
00:08:06,525 --> 00:08:10,648
[SPEAKER_19]: However, if he doesn't do that, then I'm fucking posting his phone number and posting his email.

107
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, don't forget, send me his IP.

108
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:15,731
[SPEAKER_07]: I will find his fucking address.

109
00:08:16,592 --> 00:08:20,213
[SPEAKER_07]: We can go show up at his house and say, fuck you, give it back.

110
00:08:24,794 --> 00:08:27,515
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not the C-Word show, fuck you.

111
00:08:27,935 --> 00:08:31,976
[SPEAKER_19]: And then Final Fantasy XIII, that's basically been my gaming week.

112
00:08:32,403 --> 00:08:36,264
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, DarkSakura is just fucking openly swearing randomly at our fucking chat room.

113
00:08:36,324 --> 00:08:40,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to join all the fucking action tonight in our chat room.

114
00:08:40,965 --> 00:08:44,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, three hours of this tonight, ladies and fucking gentlemen.

115
00:08:44,926 --> 00:08:46,447
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be this or the Oscars.

116
00:08:46,647 --> 00:08:47,847
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, honestly.

117
00:08:47,907 --> 00:08:52,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep track of how many fucks get fucking said so that we can fucking send it to fucking Guinness and fucking Ireland.

118
00:08:53,188 --> 00:08:53,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck.

119
00:08:53,689 --> 00:08:54,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Amazing.

120
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:55,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

121
00:08:55,789 --> 00:08:57,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop trying to run up the counter artificially.

122
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:58,794
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not artificial.

123
00:08:58,934 --> 00:08:59,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking stop it.

124
00:09:00,075 --> 00:09:03,460
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm legitimately saying fuck and I can say fuck as much as I fucking want to, Rob.

125
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,201
[SPEAKER_07]: So fuck you.

126
00:09:05,282 --> 00:09:05,703
[SPEAKER_07]: In a good way.

127
00:09:06,364 --> 00:09:07,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, any more in your fucking gaming week?

128
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:09,108
[SPEAKER_04]: I fucking love you.

129
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:10,429
[SPEAKER_04]: I fucking love you too, bitch.

130
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:11,531
[SPEAKER_19]: I also played some more of...

131
00:09:13,613 --> 00:09:14,294
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, what the fuck.

132
00:09:15,234 --> 00:09:15,715
[SPEAKER_19]: Borderlands.

133
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:22,760
[SPEAKER_19]: I play more Borderlands because I'm trying to get the game finished before I can fucking start the new expansion.

134
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,282
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm liking it still.

135
00:09:26,003 --> 00:09:29,285
[SPEAKER_19]: And I just have to level up my characters.

136
00:09:29,305 --> 00:09:33,749
[SPEAKER_19]: I actually have to level up my friend's character because he's fucking 18 levels below me.

137
00:09:34,349 --> 00:09:34,609
[SPEAKER_19]: So...

138
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:59,042
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, so I played a little bit more of that, and of course Grand Theft Auto, you know, fucking, what, rank like 74 now in the true skill ranks, and then I'm still fucking like 195 in the regular ranks, just because I don't play on the weekends, and it's, you know, kind of bounces around during the week, so, but true skill's really where I'm, you know, trying to get to the top of the fucking list, and doing pretty good, so.

139
00:09:59,582 --> 00:09:59,862
[SPEAKER_19]: That's it.

140
00:10:00,563 --> 00:10:05,546
[SPEAKER_07]: You notice how our chat room has been increasing exponentially?

141
00:10:06,387 --> 00:10:07,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and fuckdeft, cunt.

142
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:11,050
[SPEAKER_07]: I said it.

143
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,171
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate that word, and I said it, so whatever.

144
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:16,713
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at the chat, and all these fucking people are in there tonight.

145
00:10:16,753 --> 00:10:17,714
[SPEAKER_04]: We love you all, by the way.

146
00:10:18,194 --> 00:10:20,516
[SPEAKER_04]: We fucking love you and your support so much.

147
00:10:21,096 --> 00:10:23,057
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have Hardcore77777.

148
00:10:23,077 --> 00:10:24,779
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot of fucking sevens in his name there.

149
00:10:25,099 --> 00:10:27,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Says, oh, wow, I picked a bad night to listen.

150
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:31,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you fucking... Welcome to your first fucking live show.

151
00:10:31,322 --> 00:10:32,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations.

152
00:10:33,203 --> 00:10:34,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Who was that?

153
00:10:34,604 --> 00:10:36,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't any week a fucking bad night to listen?

154
00:10:37,005 --> 00:10:38,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Who was that?

155
00:10:38,526 --> 00:10:38,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Hardcore 7777777777.

156
00:10:39,066 --> 00:10:39,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven.

157
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:39,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven.

158
00:10:42,007 --> 00:10:44,869
[SPEAKER_19]: And Akula fucking GP says, Fucking GTA again?

159
00:10:44,969 --> 00:10:45,849
[SPEAKER_19]: Fuck, Loki, fuck.

160
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:47,850
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, I play that every fucking day.

161
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:48,730
[SPEAKER_19]: Twice fucking day.

162
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:50,671
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, sometimes three fucking times a day.

163
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:54,193
[SPEAKER_19]: And I fuck everyone up in it because I'm so fucking awesome.

164
00:10:54,313 --> 00:10:55,814
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I have to.

165
00:10:56,654 --> 00:10:57,735
[SPEAKER_19]: I have to mention it every week.

166
00:10:58,395 --> 00:10:59,135
[SPEAKER_19]: It's what I'm proud of.

167
00:11:00,036 --> 00:11:09,520
[SPEAKER_19]: In fact, actually, we'll get into this a little bit fucking later, but remember how they updated some TOS stuff for Xbox Live?

168
00:11:10,121 --> 00:11:18,325
[SPEAKER_19]: And now I can post my Ballad of Gay Tony ranks in there without the word gay being fucking banning me.

169
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, congratulations, I suppose.

170
00:11:21,101 --> 00:11:22,562
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a good reason.

171
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:24,143
[SPEAKER_04]: That whole policy was kind of fucked anyway.

172
00:11:24,163 --> 00:11:25,304
[SPEAKER_04]: It was overcompensating.

173
00:11:25,324 --> 00:11:26,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a story later we're going to get into?

174
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:28,366
[SPEAKER_04]: I should probably shut my fucking mouth then.

175
00:11:29,467 --> 00:11:33,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you want to talk about during your fucking gaming week?

176
00:11:36,431 --> 00:11:37,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy's awesome.

177
00:11:39,215 --> 00:11:40,656
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, my fucking gaming week.

178
00:11:41,136 --> 00:11:42,837
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing a lot of fucking WoW as usual.

179
00:11:43,218 --> 00:11:48,141
[SPEAKER_04]: My character's probably to about fucking level 53, I think I finally fucking dinged this week.

180
00:11:48,161 --> 00:11:48,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking addict.

181
00:11:49,762 --> 00:11:50,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut the fuck up.

182
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:52,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Bite my fucking ass.

183
00:11:53,744 --> 00:11:58,327
[SPEAKER_04]: My boyfriend, though, he got to level fucking 55, so he can roll a fucking Death Knight now whenever the fuck he wants.

184
00:11:58,367 --> 00:12:02,890
[SPEAKER_04]: But we might do like the twin Death Knight thing like fucking later, but I don't know.

185
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Like right now the fucking focus is getting his fucking character to 80.

186
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:23,557
[SPEAKER_04]: but the problem is I found another game that's gonna fucking sink all my time for the next two weeks which I'll get into in a minute but I wanted to talk about a couple of other fucking games real quick one of them is Critter Crunch it's so fucking cute and I finally played the full version of the game I played the fucking demo before it's fucking cute it's a lot like Magical Drop did you ever fucking play that?

187
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:25,658
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I play that.

188
00:12:25,898 --> 00:12:27,579
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't really care for it too much.

189
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:33,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine if Magical Drop wasn't about matching the fucking colors, but it was about putting things in a fucking sequence.

190
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:39,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, instead of fucking all the blues disappear, it's like you gotta go fucking green, red, and blue in an order, or whatever.

191
00:12:39,727 --> 00:12:40,828
[SPEAKER_19]: That sounds too fucking complicated.

192
00:12:40,868 --> 00:12:46,171
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not that fucking bad, because it's little bugs, fucking medium-sized bugs, and then big bugs.

193
00:12:46,724 --> 00:13:02,235
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's pretty intuitive to figure out it's not that fucking hard and there's these weird elements too where you fucking barf rainbows into little critters mouth and all these like overly cute fucking things well no wonder you fucking like it barfing rainbows shut up

194
00:13:03,035 --> 00:13:04,016
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fucking cute, shut up.

195
00:13:04,537 --> 00:13:05,938
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's lots of modes in it.

196
00:13:05,998 --> 00:13:12,204
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I'd bought the fucking game when it was on sale, but it's okay because it's on Alan's PlayStation 3 so I can play it whenever the fuck I'm over there.

197
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:12,845
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was really cute.

198
00:13:13,185 --> 00:13:17,710
[SPEAKER_04]: I played through a good probably 15 stages while I was there and got some trophies.

199
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:19,231
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cute.

200
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:24,637
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a fucking good deal and if I wasn't so busy playing something else right now, I might fucking buy the full version.

201
00:13:24,857 --> 00:13:25,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Who wants some fucking tequila?

202
00:13:26,434 --> 00:13:27,354
[SPEAKER_04]: You have fucking tequila?

203
00:13:27,454 --> 00:13:28,054
[SPEAKER_07]: You bought it.

204
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:29,995
[SPEAKER_04]: If I didn't have to fucking drive home, I would.

205
00:13:30,015 --> 00:13:30,755
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do a shot now.

206
00:13:32,096 --> 00:13:33,956
[SPEAKER_04]: As if my swearing wasn't bad enough right now.

207
00:13:33,996 --> 00:13:34,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, fuck it.

208
00:13:34,976 --> 00:13:35,977
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a night just to fuck it.

209
00:13:36,197 --> 00:13:36,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want some tequila?

210
00:13:37,197 --> 00:13:37,777
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want any tequila.

211
00:13:37,797 --> 00:13:38,237
[SPEAKER_04]: I better pass.

212
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:38,617
[SPEAKER_04]: I better pass.

213
00:13:38,897 --> 00:13:39,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, though.

214
00:13:39,378 --> 00:13:39,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Fine.

215
00:13:39,578 --> 00:13:40,658
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll drink my beer by myself.

216
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,378
[SPEAKER_04]: You fucking drink yourself into a coma.

217
00:13:42,718 --> 00:13:42,999
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

218
00:13:43,939 --> 00:13:44,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

219
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:46,820
[SPEAKER_07]: I play Misty, too.

220
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is that?

221
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Just tell me about fucking beer.

222
00:13:51,341 --> 00:13:51,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

223
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:53,001
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck else is I playing?

224
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:55,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Final Fantasy II on the fucking iPhone.

225
00:13:56,365 --> 00:13:57,506
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

226
00:14:20,445 --> 00:14:49,473
[SPEAKER_04]: but they have made some fucking adjustments to it to make it more touch friendly for instance when you're in a battle you have all these little fucking icons instead of the words to attack and even when you're in the menus to cast fucking magic there's these little fucking icons that show up that you use to cast your fucking spells and shit and you know if you want to cast your spell on all the fucking enemies you drag your finger to select all the enemies you can't unfortunately just fucking sit there and hammer the A button to get through all the fucking battles you know you have to kind of tap tap tap tap

227
00:14:49,813 --> 00:15:13,955
[SPEAKER_04]: so everything's a little bit fucking slower that's not the annoying part I don't fucking mind that as much as I do when you're in the fucking towns and you're having to use the fucking fake d-pad that's on the touch screen and the fucking button to run and you're trying to talk to fucking towns people because the frame rate is so fucking bad and everything is so fucking jumpy that you literally have to chase all the fucking town people around for a fucking minute just to fucking talk to them which shouldn't be that fucking hard in a Final Fantasy game

228
00:15:16,201 --> 00:15:21,446
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, they don't fucking tell you that before you buy it, so you won't know until you buy it.

229
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:25,069
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will say this, $9 is a pretty fucking good price for Final Fantasy 2.

230
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:30,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I bought Final Fantasy 2 because I played the original fucking Final Fantasy a ton of times, so whatever.

231
00:15:31,435 --> 00:15:54,280
[SPEAKER_04]: um but the Final Fantasy fucking 2 I only played once on the PSP so I decided what the fuck I'll buy this just to kind of check it out it's only nine dollars I will say this if you have a fucking PSP just spend the extra ten dollars to get a copy of the Final Fantasy probably not even that expensive nowadays yeah you could probably fucking find it used somewhere for cheaper so if you're gonna pay nine dollars for the fucking iPhone version did I say nucking is that a good

232
00:15:55,609 --> 00:15:57,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Nuck and... Nuck and futz!

233
00:15:59,094 --> 00:16:00,756
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fuck-ing.

234
00:16:00,996 --> 00:16:02,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thank you, I know.

235
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:07,644
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're gonna spend half as much to get the iPhone version, then you fucking get what you fucking pay for.

236
00:16:07,664 --> 00:16:08,305
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I have to say.

237
00:16:08,325 --> 00:16:12,670
[SPEAKER_04]: When it comes to controls, it's kind of weak sauce, but it is a beautiful game, and...

238
00:16:13,544 --> 00:16:14,024
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.com.

239
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:44,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XIII is on its way out on Tuesday, and we got a copy through legitimate purposes.

240
00:16:44,053 --> 00:16:45,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you worry, it's totally legit and all that stuff.

241
00:16:45,814 --> 00:16:48,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a few days early, just so we could jump in there and have something to say about it today.

242
00:16:48,616 --> 00:16:48,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

243
00:17:05,087 --> 00:17:18,839
[SPEAKER_04]: It played through the game and I've read a lot of the reviews that are online just like a lot of you guys have about how the game is really fucking linear and it's kind of just an interactive movie where you're just fucking bashing the X button for a long time.

244
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,320
[SPEAKER_04]: And I kind of go, well...

245
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:28,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy VII, I see a lot of comparisons from XIII to VII, at least in the bits that I've played so far.

246
00:17:28,488 --> 00:17:34,694
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember in Final Fantasy VII, you started that game and you were in Midgar, and you were trapped there.

247
00:17:35,194 --> 00:17:37,296
[SPEAKER_04]: I shouldn't say trapped, it makes it sound like you couldn't do anything.

248
00:17:37,637 --> 00:17:42,101
[SPEAKER_04]: But you were playing a somewhat linear story for about the first seven hours of Final Fantasy VII.

249
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:42,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

250
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:47,367
[SPEAKER_04]: and tell you, depending on, you know, how fast or slow you are, you tell you get out of Midgar and explore the overworld.

251
00:17:47,807 --> 00:17:53,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I know an overworld, well, I don't, I don't really know what, I haven't read spoilers on 13 and I don't want to know, so chat, stay quiet.

252
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:58,921
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if there's an overworld that shows up, but I already know there's no towns, so I imagine it's going to stay kind of very 10-ish.

253
00:17:58,941 --> 00:18:02,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they have Chocobo writing and they have the manual, so obviously...

254
00:18:02,845 --> 00:18:06,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so there's going to be some type of overworld later that's going to be similar to 7.

255
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:10,372
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, honestly, guys, this game has a lot in common with 7.

256
00:18:10,712 --> 00:18:12,954
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of the same types of characters.

257
00:18:13,414 --> 00:18:17,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Lightning and Cloud have a lot in common, except one's got a vagina.

258
00:18:18,939 --> 00:18:21,701
[SPEAKER_04]: There's, you know, the emo kid that you just want to slap across the face.

259
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:24,363
[SPEAKER_04]: There's your sassy black man that's there for comic relief.

260
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:26,525
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's a lot of similarities.

261
00:18:27,126 --> 00:18:27,246
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

262
00:18:28,727 --> 00:18:29,628
[SPEAKER_04]: But that isn't a bad thing.

263
00:18:29,668 --> 00:18:31,691
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Final Fantasy VII was a really good game.

264
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:38,960
[SPEAKER_04]: It got overblown a little bit by the fucking crazy-ass fans out there, but it was still a good game.

265
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:41,466
[SPEAKER_04]: X2 or X2?

266
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:41,506
[SPEAKER_04]: X2.

267
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:13,129
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a lot of... I mean, Lost Odyssey kind of had some of that too.

268
00:19:13,149 --> 00:19:18,472
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of the JRPGs are... It does remind me a lot of Lost Odyssey, actually.

269
00:19:19,453 --> 00:19:22,555
[SPEAKER_19]: But Lost Odyssey was more like Final Fantasy.

270
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:29,240
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I say it takes three hours to get there, I don't want you thinking you're just fucking bored for three hours just sitting there jerking off doing nothing.

271
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:36,885
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of find this game to be like a banana or something that slowly peels and slowly unfolds and starts to show its true shape.

272
00:19:37,145 --> 00:19:38,486
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you don't...

273
00:19:39,506 --> 00:19:46,368
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if you read any of the manual or anything before you started, but like Falsi and Lassi and stuff like that.

274
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:48,508
[SPEAKER_19]: I was like, what the fuck are they talking about?

275
00:19:48,548 --> 00:19:49,529
[SPEAKER_19]: Turn the subtitles on.

276
00:19:50,249 --> 00:19:51,769
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the subtitles on.

277
00:19:52,029 --> 00:19:54,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Interjection, just to fucking interject.

278
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,430
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm currently not listening to this because I haven't played it yet.

279
00:19:57,151 --> 00:19:58,211
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to keep the spoiler free.

280
00:19:58,251 --> 00:19:59,691
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to give stories.

281
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,852
[SPEAKER_07]: But I want to be completely surprised.

282
00:20:02,012 --> 00:20:02,732
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm

283
00:20:03,092 --> 00:20:05,675
[SPEAKER_04]: I will give little spoilers about the battle system because it's essential to the game.

284
00:20:05,695 --> 00:20:06,456
[SPEAKER_07]: I am zoning the fuck out.

285
00:20:06,536 --> 00:20:08,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, fucking zone out all you want.

286
00:20:08,778 --> 00:20:09,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Loki, what were you saying?

287
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:10,961
[SPEAKER_19]: No, it's confusing.

288
00:20:11,441 --> 00:20:18,949
[SPEAKER_19]: And I do have the subtitles and stuff turned on because I don't want to... My audio or whatever, because I have the 5.1 headphones or whatever, it's very...

289
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:21,572
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

290
00:20:43,234 --> 00:20:43,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

291
00:21:00,646 --> 00:21:01,907
[SPEAKER_04]: that occur in the story.

292
00:21:01,947 --> 00:21:05,009
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot of similarities, I think, between watching Lost on TV.

293
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:07,790
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know how Lost kind of divides people?

294
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people are like, this show's too fucking slow for me.

295
00:21:10,652 --> 00:21:12,013
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to get to the fucking point already.

296
00:21:12,453 --> 00:21:15,215
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be what makes or breaks people on Final Fantasy XIII, I think, as well.

297
00:21:15,655 --> 00:21:16,156
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

298
00:21:33,997 --> 00:21:36,599
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to speak really quickly about the battle system.

299
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:37,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Real quick, okay?

300
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:41,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy introduces this new thing called paradigm shifts.

301
00:21:42,204 --> 00:21:49,090
[SPEAKER_04]: And the easiest fucking way I could explain it is that imagine you could flip your character from a black mage to a white mage right in the middle of battle.

302
00:21:49,830 --> 00:22:12,578
[SPEAKER_04]: that's what the paradigm shifts are all about and it's a lot cooler than I think I'm making it sound because like you know you might be doing a battle and you're trying to chain things to get the monster to kind of slip into this mode where it's easier to hit it and then all of a sudden you're like oh shit I'm low on HP I better paradigm shift so I suddenly get a medic in my party and also maybe somebody that casts barrier and all that shit to protect people and then once everybody's cured up go back to assault

303
00:22:13,078 --> 00:22:14,219
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really fucking awesome.

304
00:22:33,008 --> 00:22:35,049
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot more fluid than X2.

305
00:22:35,769 --> 00:22:39,550
[SPEAKER_04]: X2 had those big, big, big animations with the dress spheres and everything.

306
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:40,971
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot quicker than that.

307
00:22:41,031 --> 00:22:43,051
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not so over the top like it was in X2.

308
00:22:43,131 --> 00:22:44,632
[SPEAKER_04]: It feels a lot more fluid.

309
00:22:44,972 --> 00:22:48,493
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to say the battle system in XIII to me feels a little bit more like an action game.

310
00:22:48,873 --> 00:22:51,254
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes active time battle to the next level.

311
00:22:51,674 --> 00:22:52,954
[SPEAKER_04]: It is fast-paced.

312
00:22:53,294 --> 00:22:54,575
[SPEAKER_04]: It is very fucking fast.

313
00:22:54,615 --> 00:23:01,017
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember much like the other Final Fantasy games, to get a preemptive strike or whatever is kind of random.

314
00:23:01,657 --> 00:23:08,421
[SPEAKER_19]: And it works a little bit different too where you don't necessarily do damage to them but it jumps that combo up so that you can do more damage to them later on.

315
00:23:23,731 --> 00:23:24,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Good, good question.

316
00:23:24,772 --> 00:23:27,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Really fucking great question from YYR in chat.

317
00:23:27,454 --> 00:23:32,619
[SPEAKER_04]: So does this mean you don't have to use any strategy when choosing your party because you can swap at any time?

318
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,483
[SPEAKER_04]: So far, and again, granted, I'm only five and a half hours in right now.

319
00:23:36,523 --> 00:23:41,448
[SPEAKER_04]: For those that are playing the game, I'm in a place called... I think it's called the Valley of Ruin is what it's called.

320
00:23:41,768 --> 00:23:42,288
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'll say.

321
00:23:42,308 --> 00:23:43,670
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to spoil stories or whatever.

322
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:44,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

323
00:23:45,751 --> 00:24:11,876
[SPEAKER_04]: you don't have control over who's in your party people switch in and out based on the story in fact there's a lot of these people are over here and these people are over here these people are over here and their paths intersect once in a while there's a lot of that going on early on in the game so you don't really have a lot of control over your party I think later on you'll be able to control that more and also don't worry the way the XP works is very similar to Ten's experience system where you're kind of moving around the board spending points and

324
00:24:12,496 --> 00:24:27,332
[SPEAKER_19]: and that was a little confusing too because I was trying to figure out I was like trying because they're all yeah you pick the direction you want to go and you hold this button down I'm like I want to go this way and it's going the opposite direction I'm like no I want to go the other way it's all right it makes it makes sense later on as you're using it's very similar to Ten's

325
00:24:27,652 --> 00:24:30,693
[SPEAKER_04]: All your characters gain points when anyone in your party wins.

326
00:24:30,954 --> 00:24:33,775
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not like you're going to have these obscenely under-leveled characters.

327
00:24:33,795 --> 00:24:34,675
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, there are no levels.

328
00:24:35,115 --> 00:24:36,736
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no levels for the characters.

329
00:24:36,956 --> 00:24:37,737
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no levels.

330
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:39,157
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no XP.

331
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:43,059
[SPEAKER_04]: But you have kind of the 10 system instead is what you have in place of that.

332
00:24:43,659 --> 00:25:10,497
[SPEAKER_04]: there's no magic points which is a huge shift there's something else they use instead of magic points but your characters are going to be flinging fire and arrow left and right with no consequence you have to really think about that and there is um what else do I want to say there's no magic and there's no oh and after every battle you're cured to full you don't have to cure your party after every battle you start heal everybody yeah it's

333
00:25:11,357 --> 00:25:12,078
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of changes.

334
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:15,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people are not going to like it, but I say give it a chance.

335
00:25:15,941 --> 00:25:18,323
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a lot of fucking fun, and I'm five and a half hours in.

336
00:25:18,664 --> 00:25:19,364
[SPEAKER_04]: I am hooked.

337
00:25:19,644 --> 00:25:21,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooked, hooked, hooked.

338
00:25:21,666 --> 00:25:24,769
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys know I have fucking gamer ADD really fucking bad.

339
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:25,870
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm always like, ooh, shiny.

340
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:29,453
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to go play this fucking blur beta, or I'm going to go play Game Room or something.

341
00:25:29,853 --> 00:25:31,235
[SPEAKER_04]: I will see this game out to completion.

342
00:25:31,475 --> 00:25:31,755
[SPEAKER_04]: I will.

343
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:32,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I will.

344
00:25:33,036 --> 00:25:33,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

345
00:25:43,447 --> 00:25:44,787
[SPEAKER_04]: You might hate these guys too.

346
00:25:45,427 --> 00:25:46,428
[SPEAKER_04]: So just a word of caution.

347
00:25:47,188 --> 00:25:48,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I see a lot of similarities.

348
00:25:49,068 --> 00:25:58,070
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't want to fall down the path of the really nerdy gamer that's virgin in his basement and stuff.

349
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,691
[SPEAKER_19]: Because we know that's not really the truth of me.

350
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,211
[SPEAKER_19]: Fuck those stereotypes.

351
00:26:02,371 --> 00:26:03,291
[SPEAKER_19]: But here's what I'm saying, dude.

352
00:26:03,431 --> 00:26:09,513
[SPEAKER_19]: And I feel really wrong saying this, but Vanille is fucking hot.

353
00:26:10,353 --> 00:26:11,974
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, it's like, what the fuck?

354
00:26:11,994 --> 00:26:12,815
[SPEAKER_19]: She's like 15.

355
00:26:12,935 --> 00:26:13,975
[SPEAKER_19]: That is gross.

356
00:26:14,276 --> 00:26:14,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking cocktease.

357
00:26:14,776 --> 00:26:16,277
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, she's a pedophile's dream.

358
00:26:16,337 --> 00:26:16,877
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of disgusting.

359
00:26:16,897 --> 00:26:21,540
[SPEAKER_19]: No, but seriously, it's like, oh, not to spoil anything, where'd you get your seal?

360
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,301
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, it's right here in my upper thigh.

361
00:26:23,322 --> 00:26:24,662
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm like, oh, come on!

362
00:26:25,743 --> 00:26:30,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was... Alan and I were both, like, just had that big reaction of, oh, I feel dirty.

363
00:26:30,267 --> 00:26:31,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, oh, oh, God, that was dirty.

364
00:26:31,849 --> 00:26:32,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

365
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:33,890
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to go take a bath in Clorox.

366
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:36,993
[SPEAKER_19]: And what's up with her voice actor, or actress, I should say?

367
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:40,897
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just, like, got an accent, and she's way too... too upbeat and...

368
00:26:42,598 --> 00:26:43,659
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know what's wrong.

369
00:27:04,594 --> 00:27:05,215
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

370
00:27:25,902 --> 00:27:26,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they?

371
00:27:26,483 --> 00:27:27,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't play enough of 10-2.

372
00:27:28,025 --> 00:27:29,026
[SPEAKER_04]: I watched some people play it.

373
00:27:29,046 --> 00:27:29,787
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't really get into it that much.

374
00:27:29,807 --> 00:27:36,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep in mind that the ending cinemas, actually a lot of the cinemas were re-synced to also fit the English dialogue.

375
00:27:37,417 --> 00:27:42,664
[SPEAKER_07]: And the end sequence, the little song that Yuna gets up and sings was completely re-animated.

376
00:27:43,226 --> 00:27:59,026
[SPEAKER_04]: I was fucking blown away by the like it's those little things that just made me go whoa and by the way since it hasn't really been mentioned yet the game is fucking gorgeous it is a beautiful beautiful game and I know I've seen those reports out there saying oh the 360 version looks you know worse than the PS3

377
00:28:00,447 --> 00:28:00,967
[SPEAKER_19]: Who cares?

378
00:28:00,987 --> 00:28:01,868
[SPEAKER_19]: Just play the fucking game.

379
00:28:02,468 --> 00:28:03,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care what system you get it on.

380
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:06,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan has already said that we're getting the PS3 one.

381
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:12,513
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what I got too, but I was just... I just knew the 360 was a port, and you know what?

382
00:28:12,633 --> 00:28:15,274
[SPEAKER_04]: I just... I wanted my achievement points.

383
00:28:16,214 --> 00:28:16,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you go 360?

384
00:28:17,355 --> 00:28:17,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I did.

385
00:28:17,835 --> 00:28:18,035
[SPEAKER_04]: I went 360.

386
00:28:18,075 --> 00:28:18,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

387
00:28:20,376 --> 00:28:20,697
[SPEAKER_04]: S3 Discs

388
00:28:37,833 --> 00:29:05,334
[SPEAKER_19]: it's just it's a beautiful game it is so like I just blown away by some of the visuals and like it's not all just like the industrial looks that you've seen in the trailers and things it is a beautiful fucking game well it was funny my friend you know at work he was like oh I don't know if this Final Fantasy is gonna be good or whatever so we played you know I started playing the game and literally got five minutes into it and it got that first action sequence that's in the train where she's jumping off the fucking walls and shit and he's like

389
00:29:06,094 --> 00:29:07,415
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, this game's not going to be a problem.

390
00:29:10,276 --> 00:29:10,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

391
00:29:11,176 --> 00:29:12,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, enough about Final Fantasy XIII.

392
00:29:12,977 --> 00:29:15,058
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure we will talk some fucking more about it next week.

393
00:29:15,098 --> 00:29:17,059
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will work the F word more into my dialogue.

394
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:21,500
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, I just want to have a serious conversation because that's like one serious topic I know people have been wondering about.

395
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:27,123
[SPEAKER_07]: But isn't part of this to prove that you can make a fucking serious point and sound fucking intelligent even if you're using fucking?

396
00:29:27,323 --> 00:29:28,643
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm still saying fuck a little bit.

397
00:29:28,803 --> 00:29:30,104
[SPEAKER_04]: I still wanted to go over the top with it.

398
00:29:30,683 --> 00:29:32,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com

399
00:29:47,545 --> 00:30:01,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, quickly here, quickly, quickly, I want to play a fucking voicemail from our good pal Breslul about USL Madness, the fucking voting going on in our forums right now to determine the best fucking game of all fucking time.

400
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,370
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going on in our forums right now.

401
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:05,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's an update from the one and only Breslul.

402
00:30:06,392 --> 00:30:15,775
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey Rob, Jamie, and Matt, this is Breslul, and I'm a bit under the weather as my voice is clearly giving it away, but I'm calling once again to promote USL Madness.

403
00:30:16,896 --> 00:30:19,557
[SPEAKER_12]: here on the OrangeZonesRadio.com forums.

404
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:27,581
[SPEAKER_12]: We have four matchups right now, and the four games will be going to the Final Four.

405
00:30:28,521 --> 00:30:37,365
[SPEAKER_12]: We have Mario 3 vs. Ocarina of Time, Final Fantasy 6 vs. DDR, Chrono Trigger vs. Super Metroid, and Link to the Past vs. Mega Man 2.

406
00:30:38,205 --> 00:30:42,687
[SPEAKER_12]: Four of those games go on to the Final Four, and it's up to you, the listeners,

407
00:30:43,385 --> 00:30:44,705
[SPEAKER_12]: to decide who goes on.

[SPEAKER_12]: Until then, see you guys later.

411
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:07,310

[SPEAKER_04]: Someone get Brestle a fucking cough drop, Jesus.

414
00:31:10,555 --> 00:31:14,103
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder where the term under the weather originated.

415
00:31:14,724 --> 00:31:17,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if you're feeling really great, are you over the weather?

416
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:20,385
[SPEAKER_04]: is it on fucking Wikipedia or something?

417
00:31:20,425 --> 00:31:25,727
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll look it up you are not playing the fucking unicorn game again, are you?

418
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:32,248
[SPEAKER_07]: I fucking played Robot Unicorn today I actually, I did download the anus game did you fucking play it yet?

419
00:31:32,268 --> 00:31:40,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't play any fucking anus you need to play the pink anus before next week trust me, once you get sucked into Final Fantasy XIII that's all you're gonna fucking play

420
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:41,791
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be pretty busy.

421
00:31:57,886 --> 00:31:58,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Real fucking life!

422
00:32:19,517 --> 00:32:22,879
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, the 3D version was just not playing at the right time, and it's more expensive.

423
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:29,341
[SPEAKER_19]: And I honestly don't think the fucking 3D was that good, and, you know, Alice in Wonderland, just based off what I saw in the trailer.

424
00:32:29,842 --> 00:32:35,084
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I neglected, some of our chatters are really fucking confused right now that we're suddenly talking about playing The Pink Anus.

425
00:32:35,504 --> 00:32:37,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me give some fucking background to that.

426
00:32:38,145 --> 00:32:39,526
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, listen to last week's show.

427
00:32:39,566 --> 00:32:40,546
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all fucking explained there.

428
00:32:40,586 --> 00:32:43,187
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a game on Steam called, what the fuck is it?

429
00:32:43,247 --> 00:32:44,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Secrets of the Magic Crystal?

430
00:32:45,328 --> 00:32:48,670
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a game that looks like you're breeding unicorns or some fucking bullshit.

431
00:32:49,290 --> 00:33:14,609
[SPEAKER_04]: but one of the items that you're using if you look at the various screenshots one of the items you use in your fucking horse breeding has these little pink bars and they're called anus a-e-n-u-s so we officially have fucking called this the pink anus game because it's funny and you get to say anus and you're not being vulgar you're just talking about what's in a video game so there you fucking go there's some explanation on what's going on

432
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's see, what other fucking housekeeping do I have?

433
00:33:19,401 --> 00:33:22,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Why aren't you fucking following us on Twitter and Facebook and all that stuff?

434
00:33:23,023 --> 00:33:38,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter.com slash OLR, we'll take your fucking Twitter questions later You know, because it is a show where every fucking gamer has a voice Even when that voice is very vulgar We also have our Facebook at Orange Lounge Radio We have a MySpace too, but I haven't logged in there for like fucking three months But I guess I should check on that

435
00:33:39,028 --> 00:33:40,730
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I really should post more

436
00:33:56,403 --> 00:34:21,865
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know a fucking lot about, but it's Yakuza 3 I haven't really been fucking following this very closely because I didn't really play Yakuza 1 or Yakuza 2 But I still found Dekeman's article very fucking interesting Because Sega made all these fucking localization changes to Yakuza 3 that have people pissed off And I think Dekeman does a very fucking good job of running it down And I'm also just kind of fucking appreciative that there's like actual content on our website besides just the show postings So I'm tipping my fucking hat to Dekeman right fucking now

437
00:34:22,425 --> 00:34:36,592
[SPEAKER_04]: um so yeah and if you want to write stuff for our website get in touch with me you can send me an email rob at orange launch radio.com we're looking for opinions and shit stuff that fits into the fucking every gamer has a voice uh thing so if you're interested drop me an email uh we'll see what we can fucking do

438
00:34:37,936 --> 00:34:38,956
[SPEAKER_04]: and go read Deekman's article.

439
00:34:38,996 --> 00:34:39,717
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty fucking great.

440
00:34:39,817 --> 00:34:42,760
[SPEAKER_04]: And Deekman posted, just for you, Jamie, something on Digimon earlier.

441
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you fucking saw it.

442
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, go to OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

443
00:34:45,242 --> 00:34:46,463
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I can see.

444
00:34:46,663 --> 00:34:47,664
[SPEAKER_05]: It's our own fucking website.

445
00:34:47,824 --> 00:34:48,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Take a look.

446
00:34:48,604 --> 00:34:49,785
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been busy.

447
00:34:49,885 --> 00:34:50,946
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

448
00:34:50,986 --> 00:34:51,867
[SPEAKER_04]: What else do I want to say?

449
00:34:52,027 --> 00:34:52,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

450
00:34:52,648 --> 00:34:59,453
[SPEAKER_04]: On OrangeLaunchRadio.com, on the left side, there's a little fucking box that says... I don't even remember what it says, but it's got all the links...

451
00:35:00,434 --> 00:35:02,235
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a fucking loser tonight.

452
00:35:02,876 --> 00:35:08,680
[SPEAKER_04]: It's where it has all the Twitter icon and the last FM and all the places you can follow us and so forth.

453
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Extended Play.

454
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,481
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it's fucking called.

455
00:35:10,521 --> 00:35:11,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Extended Play.

456
00:35:11,582 --> 00:35:12,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Just look in that box.

457
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:13,923
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like all the communities we're on.

458
00:35:14,223 --> 00:35:14,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Check that out.

459
00:35:14,764 --> 00:35:16,145
[SPEAKER_04]: A link to the OLR PSP.

460
00:35:16,425 --> 00:35:21,068
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're on a PSP and you have not visited OLRPSP.com, you're fucking missing out.

461
00:35:21,088 --> 00:35:21,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Where the fuck have you been?

462
00:35:22,109 --> 00:35:22,709
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, exactly.

463
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:24,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I know we get new listeners every week.

464
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't fucking updated that in a long time, too.

465
00:35:26,832 --> 00:35:30,034
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very sorry, by the way, if we have new listeners tonight.

466
00:35:30,434 --> 00:35:54,339
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, honestly This is not normal If this is your first fucking show, you need to realize tonight is a fucking protest We are exercising our first fucking amendment fucking rights Congratulations if you made it this far And keep in mind, normally we are really Rob will say that He will literally say, quote, the F word, end quote Or F that Why am I doing quote fingers?

467
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:59,900
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't fucking see what I'm doing That makes great fucking radio Bite my fucking ass, please

468
00:36:01,112 --> 00:36:01,733
[SPEAKER_07]: I said it nicely.

469
00:36:02,273 --> 00:36:03,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Please makes it nice.

470
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Please makes it very fucking nice.

471
00:36:05,056 --> 00:36:21,471
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the other thing to keep in mind is that I bet anything there's going to be one of those fucking like podcasts that reviews other podcasts or something or some fucking asshole on his blogs and say, I listen to Orange Lounge Radio and all they did was say fuck because they're just stupid and can't think of anything else to say.

472
00:36:22,112 --> 00:36:23,293
[SPEAKER_16]: They don't know what the fuck they're talking about.

473
00:36:23,313 --> 00:36:25,175
[SPEAKER_19]: Why would you have a fucking podcast review other podcasts?

474
00:36:25,195 --> 00:36:25,815
[SPEAKER_19]: That seems like a...

475
00:36:27,757 --> 00:36:41,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, we are protesting the anti-cussing week that our government has seen fit to waste fucking money and time voting upon when we're in the middle of a budget crisis.

476
00:36:41,565 --> 00:36:50,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Students are fucking going out on the freeway and threatening to get fucking run over by cars in protest of how bad the fees have gotten to universities.

477
00:36:51,872 --> 00:36:55,554
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a student myself and even going to junior college right now is fucking expensive.

478
00:36:55,594 --> 00:36:55,654
[SPEAKER_07]: And

479
00:36:55,814 --> 00:37:02,397
[SPEAKER_19]: Come on, look at how bad the fucking universities are if the students think that that's a good idea, running around on the freeway.

480
00:37:02,677 --> 00:37:05,079
[SPEAKER_19]: Didn't they fucking learn that in, like, preschool?

481
00:37:05,419 --> 00:37:05,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing.

482
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:07,640
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we should have a 60-star 11.

483
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:19,206
[SPEAKER_04]: What I need the OL Army and the people that get it tonight, you fucking cool kids that are understanding the show tonight, if you see this shit out there on the internet somewhere, fucking tear them a new asshole.

484
00:37:20,046 --> 00:37:35,147
[SPEAKER_04]: because honestly fucking independent people should be supporting each other not tearing each other down I don't fucking talk bad about independent podcasts open fucking season on those that get paid to do it in the core podcast though I will rip them apart but indie podcasts need to fucking help each other out

485
00:37:35,407 --> 00:37:50,007
[SPEAKER_07]: and if I may make my own statement about that and this goes even on an individual basis usually when someone puts down somebody else without giving any constructive feedback it's because they are having issues with themselves low fucking self-esteem leads to bitchiness

486
00:37:51,621 --> 00:37:53,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, haven't you noticed that?

487
00:37:53,902 --> 00:37:59,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually the people who are the loudest or certain people who are anti-gay are usually the closet.

488
00:37:59,904 --> 00:38:00,924
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just fucking thinking that.

489
00:38:00,984 --> 00:38:03,745
[SPEAKER_04]: That happened in our backyard at Main National News.

490
00:38:03,765 --> 00:38:07,967
[SPEAKER_04]: This huge fucking anti-gay Republican piece of shit.

491
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:11,189
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some cool Republicans, believe it or not.

492
00:38:11,209 --> 00:38:13,611
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just the wrong fucking people are in control of that party right now.

493
00:38:13,651 --> 00:38:15,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Meghan McCain, I'm down with her.

494
00:38:15,172 --> 00:38:16,253
[SPEAKER_04]: She is a cool Republican.

495
00:38:16,633 --> 00:38:28,663
[SPEAKER_04]: But idiots like this guy who fucking voted yes on A and then fucking has all this legislation that's fucking anti-gay gets caught at Faces, a gay bar that Jamie and I have fucking gone to several times.

496
00:38:28,683 --> 00:38:30,805
[SPEAKER_07]: This place makes gay look straight.

497
00:38:31,345 --> 00:38:31,926
Yeah.

498
00:38:32,826 --> 00:38:48,582
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been there coming back from fucking faces with another guy in his car I mean, anyway, sorry we need to go back and do karaoke at faces that would be a lot of fucking fun I actually did have another point with this is that you know

499
00:38:50,336 --> 00:38:56,583
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not really just the budget crisis that haven't we hit, what is it, somewhere between 14 and 17% statewide unemployment?

500
00:38:57,605 --> 00:38:59,187
[SPEAKER_07]: So people, there's no fucking jobs out there.

501
00:38:59,647 --> 00:39:07,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Yet, instead of doing things, you know, to help people get jobs, to create new programs, they're wasting their time and effort on...

502
00:39:08,457 --> 00:39:31,072
[SPEAKER_04]: safeguarding morality which is an individual choice so to our government right now fuck you in your ear because your ass is not good enough some quick fucking comments from chat hardcore777 says both Republicans and Democrats are corrupt I'd fucking agree with that honestly because the budget crisis we have in this state right now it's everybody's fucking fault

503
00:39:31,712 --> 00:39:32,653
[SPEAKER_07]: I totally agree.

504
00:39:32,733 --> 00:39:37,717
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate going back to the political topic, but this is something that needs to be said.

505
00:39:38,497 --> 00:39:43,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Part of the problem is that we are so stuck in this bipartisan system.

506
00:39:43,721 --> 00:39:48,844
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure if you ask anybody, it's even on public sites that say America has a two-party system.

507
00:39:49,065 --> 00:39:49,845
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a fucking lie.

508
00:39:50,405 --> 00:39:52,507
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have independent political parties.

509
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:57,510
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just the Democrats and the Republicans are the ones with the money to spend on it.

510
00:39:58,591 --> 00:40:00,452
[SPEAKER_07]: and the independents fall to the wayside.

511
00:40:00,552 --> 00:40:03,433
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that is the reason why I wish that Perot had won.

512
00:40:05,413 --> 00:40:06,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know about you.

513
00:40:06,314 --> 00:40:06,894
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

514
00:40:07,094 --> 00:40:11,135
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm saying that is... For what he fucking stood for, I get it.

515
00:40:11,195 --> 00:40:11,456
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.

516
00:40:11,476 --> 00:40:14,417
[SPEAKER_07]: For what he would do for the, I think, morale.

517
00:40:14,457 --> 00:40:16,037
[SPEAKER_04]: He's the one I'd pick, but okay.

518
00:40:16,257 --> 00:40:22,759
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not saying that he's the one I would have picked, but I'm saying that as an independent who came closer than anyone... To break down the fucking turd wall.

519
00:40:22,779 --> 00:40:22,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

520
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:23,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

521
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,902
[SPEAKER_07]: 4 years, vote him out.

522
00:40:27,002 --> 00:40:28,624
[SPEAKER_07]: At least business won't be fucked up.

523
00:40:28,644 --> 00:40:29,324
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a businessman.

524
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:34,249
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm saying that I would like to see the wall shattered.

525
00:40:34,269 --> 00:40:39,593
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to see people break out of their little voting strict Republican because, oh, they're Republican.

526
00:40:40,374 --> 00:40:45,339
[SPEAKER_07]: This is why I get an absentee ballot every fucking year.

527
00:40:45,939 --> 00:40:46,780
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

528
00:41:05,485 --> 00:41:05,845
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry

529
00:41:20,555 --> 00:41:21,576
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

530
00:41:38,658 --> 00:42:01,743
[SPEAKER_04]: podcasts I subscribe to and I unsubscribe from Orange Lounge Radio this week because I find them very annoying and the girl talks too much and the guy's too gay and the other guy's too angry and blah blah blah like just shut the fuck up talk about a podcast you do like nobody reads your fucking blog because you're so fucking negative that's the thing anyhow

531
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,660
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as I know, the other podcasts are cool.

532
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,761
[SPEAKER_04]: If somebody is talking about us, I don't know yet.

533
00:42:07,801 --> 00:42:10,301
[SPEAKER_04]: But if I find out, it's fucking on.

534
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:10,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

535
00:42:11,782 --> 00:42:12,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

536
00:42:13,942 --> 00:42:17,002
[SPEAKER_04]: How about 45 minutes into the show and now some fucking gaming news, right?

537
00:42:17,703 --> 00:42:18,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

538
00:42:19,063 --> 00:42:21,023
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, let's get into this.

539
00:42:21,223 --> 00:42:25,164
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's this bug that fucking popped up last week.

540
00:42:25,204 --> 00:42:29,625
[SPEAKER_19]: We thought it was, you know, maybe someone hacking the fucking PlayStation Network or something like that.

541
00:42:29,985 --> 00:42:30,845
[SPEAKER_19]: Which, that's still...

542
00:42:31,545 --> 00:42:38,367
[SPEAKER_19]: Bakes the question, what the hell was that webpage then that said, you know, hey, turn on your fucking Java and your whatever.

543
00:42:39,147 --> 00:42:39,988
[SPEAKER_19]: So I don't know what that was.

544
00:42:40,048 --> 00:42:41,788
[SPEAKER_19]: But anyways, this was completely unrelated.

545
00:42:41,908 --> 00:42:48,190
[SPEAKER_19]: All apparently the, well, most of the fat PlayStation 3s, the old style ones.

546
00:42:48,910 --> 00:43:14,451
[SPEAKER_19]: had trouble connecting to the PlayStation Network due to a bug in one of the ARM chips and apparently this was caused by the PlayStation 3 thinking apparently that it was a leap year when it wasn't and it became unsynced and so because of this date-time desynchronization it was unable to connect to the PlayStation Network as a safety precaution or something.

547
00:43:16,412 --> 00:43:20,993
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyways, within a little amount of time, it was actually fixed.

548
00:43:21,633 --> 00:43:31,896
[SPEAKER_19]: Basically, the only advice they fucking gave was, don't turn your system on because you may lose your trophies and some games may not work and blah, blah, blah.

549
00:43:32,056 --> 00:43:36,537
[SPEAKER_04]: My favorite was how when it was all fucking over, they were like, we fucking fixed it.

550
00:43:36,637 --> 00:43:40,698
[SPEAKER_04]: It's okay to turn on your fucking PlayStations now when they didn't do a goddamn thing.

551
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:41,898
[SPEAKER_04]: They just waited it out.

552
00:43:42,138 --> 00:43:42,658
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all they did.

553
00:43:43,373 --> 00:43:44,733
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't fucking fix it.

554
00:43:45,614 --> 00:43:46,994
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a bug in the date.

555
00:43:47,054 --> 00:43:48,794
[SPEAKER_04]: And as soon as the date changed, all better.

556
00:43:50,775 --> 00:43:57,137
[SPEAKER_04]: So somebody fucked up and thought 2010 was a leap year and somehow that made it in the old fucking PlayStations.

557
00:43:57,317 --> 00:43:58,657
[SPEAKER_19]: Here's my fucking problem with that.

558
00:43:58,697 --> 00:44:04,699
[SPEAKER_19]: Apparently those chips were actually the same chips that were in the Zunes.

559
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:11,621
[SPEAKER_19]: You may not remember the end of 2008, I think, when it switched over into the year.

560
00:44:11,641 --> 00:44:12,821
[SPEAKER_19]: Isn't it like fucking New Year?

561
00:44:13,121 --> 00:44:19,566
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it was like New Year's and all the Zunes stopped working because of the ARM CPU chip and apparently there was a date bug in that too.

562
00:44:20,006 --> 00:44:20,527
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, guess what?

563
00:44:20,547 --> 00:44:26,411
[SPEAKER_19]: The same chip was actually inside the PlayStation 3 all along and it was a known problem.

564
00:44:26,871 --> 00:44:30,073
[SPEAKER_19]: But they just kind of... Oops!

565
00:44:30,133 --> 00:44:31,615
[SPEAKER_19]: We forgot all about it!

566
00:44:32,035 --> 00:44:33,236
[SPEAKER_07]: You have a Zune.

567
00:44:33,896 --> 00:44:34,857
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't... Didn't...

568
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:36,530
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I don't have one anymore.

569
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:37,031
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh.

570
00:44:37,811 --> 00:44:38,371
[SPEAKER_19]: Times get tough.

571
00:44:38,811 --> 00:44:51,055
[SPEAKER_19]: But yes, I, I mean, you know, you don't really want your whatever to stop working all of a sudden because, oh, we didn't realize there was this bug in here and that's a problem.

572
00:44:53,556 --> 00:44:53,876
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

573
00:44:54,336 --> 00:44:56,717
[SPEAKER_19]: And it doesn't look good when your consoles stop fucking working.

574
00:44:56,737 --> 00:44:57,957
[SPEAKER_19]: The only advice I can give you is,

575
00:44:58,908 --> 00:44:59,468
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't play it.

576
00:45:28,781 --> 00:45:29,321
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

577
00:45:49,532 --> 00:46:15,768
[SPEAKER_04]: there needs it's very reminiscent of that very controversial Ubisoft DRM that I know we're going to get into later in the show but it just fucking strikes me as like a little hint of that and I do not like that do not fucking want so there's a piece of me that's like Sony doesn't need to fucking fix the date issue Sony needs to fucking fix the I can't play my games online if something is broken on their end issue that's the fucking problem

578
00:46:15,868 --> 00:46:25,092
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, here's the other fucking thing that it's really bad is since they didn't really do anything, I mean, is this actually going to get patched out or like four years from now are we going to run into the same fucking problem again?

579
00:46:26,613 --> 00:46:27,713
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, don't forget about it.

580
00:46:27,813 --> 00:46:28,534
[SPEAKER_19]: It's okay.

581
00:46:29,694 --> 00:46:30,335
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, yay.

582
00:46:30,375 --> 00:46:33,236
[SPEAKER_19]: You remember that one time that all those PS3s went fucking down?

583
00:46:33,696 --> 00:46:40,379
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it's going to happen again because it's not a leap year, but try telling that to the PlayStation.

584
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,101
[SPEAKER_19]: It makes whatever year it wants fucking leap.

585
00:46:45,871 --> 00:46:52,333
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh... Well, is there a fucking possibility this is gonna happen in the future?

586
00:46:53,533 --> 00:46:56,214
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I don't think it will be, because it'll be probably patched out.

587
00:46:56,414 --> 00:46:57,854
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's put something to ignore it.

588
00:46:59,155 --> 00:46:59,395
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

589
00:47:00,335 --> 00:47:10,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, in other fucking Sony news, we have news about their fucking motion controller that's been kind of quiet ever since the last E3, but I'm assuming that it's because they're gonna have some fucking new news this year at E3.

590
00:47:11,418 --> 00:47:11,878
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um...

591
00:47:13,345 --> 00:47:15,246
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation Arc PlayStation Arc

592
00:47:42,063 --> 00:47:43,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Arc, Augmentive Reality Controller

593
00:48:03,204 --> 00:48:03,765
[SPEAKER_19]: Arc the Lad Games

594
00:48:26,757 --> 00:48:28,238
[SPEAKER_19]: I somehow really fucking doubt that.

595
00:48:29,758 --> 00:48:33,299
[SPEAKER_19]: Or you'll be able to stick two of each animal into that controller.

596
00:48:33,759 --> 00:48:34,079
[SPEAKER_19]: Shut up.

597
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:37,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Or it will be the fuck controller.

598
00:48:37,301 --> 00:48:38,941
[SPEAKER_04]: How the fuck will that work?

599
00:48:39,381 --> 00:48:41,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Playing fucking Gradius with a motion controller.

600
00:48:41,402 --> 00:48:46,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you fucking just flail around to move your fucking ship all around and then pew pew pew with your button?

601
00:48:46,403 --> 00:48:47,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I don't fucking understand that.

602
00:48:47,784 --> 00:48:50,585
[SPEAKER_04]: How is Gradius going to incorporate motion control?

603
00:48:50,605 --> 00:48:51,225
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes no sense.

604
00:48:52,097 --> 00:48:54,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, by the way, Becky just alerted me to something.

605
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:55,340
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

606
00:48:56,081 --> 00:48:58,623
[SPEAKER_07]: That Cuss Free Week did not pass the Senate.

607
00:49:01,046 --> 00:49:03,047
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was on the news and everything.

608
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:07,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'll see if I can get her to send me a link.

609
00:49:08,772 --> 00:49:09,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe there's more.

610
00:49:09,433 --> 00:49:12,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, still, still, it doesn't matter because it doesn't matter.

611
00:49:12,595 --> 00:49:19,340
[SPEAKER_04]: The fucking point still stands whether it passed or not because they wasted their fucking time actually voting on this.

612
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:23,883
[SPEAKER_04]: It's even worse if it didn't fucking pass because then they wasted all that fucking time for fucking nothing.

613
00:49:23,963 --> 00:49:24,463
[SPEAKER_07]: So fuck them.

614
00:49:26,805 --> 00:49:26,925
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

615
00:49:28,456 --> 00:49:29,777
[SPEAKER_19]: Any attack on my freedom speech.

616
00:49:29,797 --> 00:49:33,319
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know how you would fucking play Gradius with a motion controller.

617
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:39,002
[SPEAKER_19]: The only thing I could think of is that maybe you control the options that way or something.

618
00:49:39,022 --> 00:49:39,702
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

619
00:49:41,003 --> 00:49:43,684
[SPEAKER_19]: Me, I flail around and knock the ships out of the way.

620
00:49:43,884 --> 00:49:44,785
[SPEAKER_19]: It sounds dumb.

621
00:49:45,445 --> 00:49:48,887
[SPEAKER_19]: I like the name, but the thing sounds dumb.

622
00:49:49,007 --> 00:49:50,988
[SPEAKER_07]: They did pass California Acupuncture Day.

623
00:49:52,829 --> 00:49:53,409
What the fuck?

624
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:56,311
[SPEAKER_19]: I am not even going to try to dignify that one.

625
00:49:56,798 --> 00:49:57,518
[SPEAKER_04]: So, maybe we would see them.

626
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:25,106
[SPEAKER_07]: and you know what?

627
00:50:25,286 --> 00:50:31,191
[SPEAKER_07]: As soon as I saw the little caption on Destructoid, I had to go grab my game and take a picture.

628
00:50:32,092 --> 00:50:33,934
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a big fucking box for a video game.

629
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:34,435
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

630
00:50:34,995 --> 00:50:35,856
[SPEAKER_04]: God bless those video games.

631
00:50:35,916 --> 00:50:37,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Baseball fucking stars.

632
00:50:37,137 --> 00:50:39,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and by the way, paid 48 bucks for it.

633
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:40,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Yikes.

634
00:50:41,391 --> 00:50:44,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but keep in mind how much we paid for fucking King of Fighters 2000.

635
00:50:44,313 --> 00:50:45,154
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

636
00:50:45,174 --> 00:50:48,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Weren't those fucking games like fucking $200 when they first came out?

637
00:50:48,317 --> 00:50:49,057
[SPEAKER_07]: We paid $350 for it.

638
00:50:50,598 --> 00:50:53,781
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the time, all the other sites were selling it for about $400.

639
00:50:53,841 --> 00:50:56,123
[SPEAKER_07]: So we got a really good fucking deal on it.

640
00:50:57,691 --> 00:50:57,991
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

641
00:50:58,311 --> 00:51:00,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

642
00:51:00,732 --> 00:51:06,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Some fucking clarifications in our chatroom because, of course, the chatroom gets all sicked on it and everything.

643
00:51:06,815 --> 00:51:10,937
[SPEAKER_04]: It did fucking pass the assembly, but it was fucking rejected in the Senate.

644
00:51:11,557 --> 00:51:13,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there like a high crisis?

645
00:51:13,438 --> 00:51:14,619
[SPEAKER_04]: My point still stands.

646
00:51:14,659 --> 00:51:23,823
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a waste of fucking time no matter what happened and that this was even allowed to get somewhere and that people are fucking listening to this guy and, you know, what they stand for and everything.

647
00:51:23,903 --> 00:51:24,043
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

648
00:51:24,523 --> 00:51:25,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Point still stands.

649
00:51:25,385 --> 00:51:28,650
[SPEAKER_04]: And besides, you all have been wanting a fucking fuck show for like a year and a half.

650
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:29,692
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a good fucking reason.

651
00:51:29,772 --> 00:51:32,877
[SPEAKER_04]: The joke's been running for like a year and a half, so now's as good of a time as any.

652
00:51:33,297 --> 00:51:33,578
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

653
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:34,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

654
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:35,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

655
00:51:36,022 --> 00:51:36,743
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um...

656
00:51:38,601 --> 00:51:39,402
[SPEAKER_19]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

657
00:51:58,379 --> 00:52:18,212
[SPEAKER_19]: and these two studio heads just all of a sudden aren't working there anymore and now more and more information kind of came out about that and apparently it was according to a bunch of lawsuits here because now they're filing lawsuits against Activision

658
00:52:19,793 --> 00:52:21,434
[SPEAKER_19]: for unpaid royalties.

659
00:52:21,914 --> 00:52:37,662
[SPEAKER_19]: Apparently, these guys, you know, they did all their hard work on Modern Warfare 2 or whatever, and Activision wanted them, you know, they were kind of strong-arming them into making, you know, the next Modern Warfare game or whatever, the next war game take place in Vietnam, and...

660
00:52:38,803 --> 00:52:39,524
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

661
00:53:08,901 --> 00:53:13,664
[SPEAKER_19]: and it says, after all we have given Activision, we shouldn't have to sue to get paid.

662
00:53:15,044 --> 00:53:23,869
[SPEAKER_19]: And of course, Activision, you know, responding to their lawsuit, they say that they're disappointed in the lawsuit and that it's meritless.

663
00:53:24,669 --> 00:53:34,321
[SPEAKER_19]: ActaVision is disappointed that Mr. Zemparella and Mr. West have chosen to file a lawsuit and believes their claims are meritless.

664
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:40,448
[SPEAKER_19]: Over eight years, ActaVision shareholders provided these executives with their capital they needed to start in Findy Ward.

665
00:53:40,829 --> 00:53:43,332
[SPEAKER_19]: So basically they're saying, hey, we made you, now we can break you.

666
00:53:43,972 --> 00:53:51,956
[SPEAKER_19]: as well as financial support, resources, and creative independence that help them flourish and achieve enormous professional success and personal wealth.

667
00:53:52,177 --> 00:53:57,639
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, because if they didn't give them money, I'm sure that they couldn't create these wonderful games, is what they're saying.

668
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:05,403
[SPEAKER_19]: Granted that studios do need money to get going, but I think it's just the creative talent behind it that creates the games.

669
00:54:05,764 --> 00:54:07,144
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyways, it continues.

670
00:54:07,304 --> 00:54:16,269
[SPEAKER_19]: In return, Activision legitimately expected them to honor their obligations to Activision, just like any other executives who hold positions and trust in the company.

671
00:54:16,629 --> 00:54:24,473
[SPEAKER_19]: While the company showed enormous patience, it firmly believes that its decision was justified based on the courses of conduct and actions.

672
00:54:24,533 --> 00:54:24,994
[SPEAKER_19]: Basically...

673
00:54:25,974 --> 00:54:35,520
[SPEAKER_19]: Long story short, they were unhappy with what was going on with Activision, and so the rumor is that they were kind of shopping around elsewhere.

674
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:39,342
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not the only ones that kind of had their fucking fill of Activision, that's for sure.

675
00:54:39,642 --> 00:54:41,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I read this quick comment from chat from Oddfuck?

676
00:54:41,863 --> 00:54:46,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, the opinions in our chatroom are not necessarily those of us here on the show, but here's Oddfuck in our chatroom.

677
00:54:47,286 --> 00:54:51,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby Kotek needs to die in a fucking fire with fucking fire ants on his face while everyone fucking pisses on him.

678
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:54,271
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

679
00:55:12,688 --> 00:55:33,059
[SPEAKER_04]: you have the fucking all these subsidies of Activision getting shut down all the stuff that's fucking going on now with you know their biggest selling game I mean the Bobby Kotek looks like a fucking buffoon right now like if I were a shareholder I would be demanding some fucking answers and calling for some fucking you know I just think it's

680
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:58,768
[SPEAKER_19]: They look stupid, and unfortunately, you know, if Infinity War... What it comes down to is if Infinity War ends up, you know, dissolving or whatever, I mean, they'll just move on to... Because they were before, they were behind Medal of Honor and stuff, they were working on that series, and they left to go form, you know, this new company, basically, to, you know, create the Call of Duty series, and the Call of Duty series has been really awesome, but...

681
00:55:59,548 --> 00:56:01,609
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, they're going to be treated like dicks.

682
00:56:01,669 --> 00:56:02,270
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, come on.

683
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:06,272
[SPEAKER_19]: Activision's been so awful now that they're making EA look fucking awesome.

684
00:56:06,852 --> 00:56:09,353
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to address some fucking good points in chat.

685
00:56:09,394 --> 00:56:11,895
[SPEAKER_04]: ShadowFuckingRunner says, Rob, are they still making money?

686
00:56:12,235 --> 00:56:13,956
[SPEAKER_04]: And YOIR says, Rob, it doesn't matter.

687
00:56:14,016 --> 00:56:15,677
[SPEAKER_04]: People are still buying their products in droves.

688
00:56:15,937 --> 00:56:17,398
[SPEAKER_04]: The shareholders demand results.

689
00:56:17,718 --> 00:56:21,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hold on, guys, because all this fucking stuff has come out, like, literally within the past couple weeks.

690
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:28,004
[SPEAKER_04]: And although we've kind of known Activision's going down a shady path for a while, this whole one-two punch I'm talking about is just in the past couple weeks.

691
00:56:28,544 --> 00:56:33,669
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't mean he's going to fucking get pulled from the board tomorrow.

692
00:56:34,229 --> 00:56:36,271
[SPEAKER_04]: But wait about six months to a year.

693
00:56:37,192 --> 00:56:41,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a little while and see when that next Modern Warfare games comes out.

694
00:56:41,696 --> 00:56:42,817
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's not fucking up to par...

695
00:56:44,144 --> 00:56:44,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

696
00:57:08,907 --> 00:57:14,109
[SPEAKER_19]: The whole reason they even take on Brutal Legend, that kind of stuff, and Ghostbusters.

697
00:57:14,689 --> 00:57:20,492
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, we can't figure out a way to pump out a new game every year in this franchise, so we're just not going to take it.

698
00:57:21,192 --> 00:57:22,893
[SPEAKER_19]: And then same with Guitar Hero.

699
00:57:22,913 --> 00:57:25,334
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, look how they're treating download content and stuff.

700
00:57:25,754 --> 00:57:27,054
[SPEAKER_19]: Very little each month.

701
00:57:27,294 --> 00:57:28,215
[SPEAKER_19]: And look at DJ Hero.

702
00:57:28,275 --> 00:57:28,435
[SPEAKER_19]: What?

703
00:57:28,835 --> 00:57:30,035
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow, two download packs.

704
00:57:30,456 --> 00:57:30,876
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks.

705
00:57:31,576 --> 00:57:32,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks a lot.

706
00:57:32,557 --> 00:57:33,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Way to support it.

707
00:57:33,978 --> 00:57:35,459
[SPEAKER_04]: I will fucking say this, though.

708
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:37,801
[SPEAKER_04]: You do have a fucking point that it's about the money.

709
00:57:38,061 --> 00:57:40,242
[SPEAKER_04]: They can do all the fucking dickhead things they want in the world.

710
00:57:40,282 --> 00:57:41,203
[SPEAKER_04]: In the end, it's about the money.

711
00:57:41,964 --> 00:57:57,655
[SPEAKER_04]: But my little butt with that is, or my big butt, depending on whatever you want to look at it as, don't underestimate the gamers and kind of the impact that all that negative press on all the blogs and shit can have.

712
00:57:58,644 --> 00:58:00,485
[SPEAKER_04]: I could be wrong, and that's fucking fine.

713
00:58:00,625 --> 00:58:01,945
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's going to come down.

714
00:58:02,085 --> 00:58:10,309
[SPEAKER_19]: Unfortunately, it's going to fucking be just like the protests or whatever with Call of Duty, how they were saying, oh, we're protesting this game.

715
00:58:10,329 --> 00:58:11,329
[SPEAKER_19]: We're not going to fucking buy it.

716
00:58:11,909 --> 00:58:13,930
[SPEAKER_19]: And sure enough, everyone's buying it.

717
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:15,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the Left 4 Dead thing.

718
00:58:15,991 --> 00:58:17,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, that's a different company.

719
00:58:17,212 --> 00:58:23,434
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, remember fucking the Left 4 Dead fucking thing on Steam that all the fucking people were playing Left 4 Dead 2?

720
00:58:24,054 --> 00:58:24,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Or they got the screenshot?

721
00:58:25,035 --> 00:58:25,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

722
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:52,195
[SPEAKER_19]: same same story so if you really fucking mean it if you're really fucking you know pissed off that these guys got fired for all their hard work then you need to stop fucking buying the games just stop don't buy the next Call of Duty game it's not going to be an Infinity Ward game anyways I mean that's if you want to wait the way you want to look at it I mean look at they're gonna put Treyarch in you know charge of it and unfortunately Treyarch's just not as good as Infinity Ward I mean people even know that um

723
00:58:54,088 --> 00:58:56,028
[SPEAKER_19]: I just... I don't know.

724
00:58:57,389 --> 00:58:59,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, you know, vote with your money.

725
00:58:59,529 --> 00:58:59,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

726
00:59:00,449 --> 00:59:01,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about some fucking titties.

727
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:04,010
[SPEAKER_04]: How's that sound?

728
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:04,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Perk?

729
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:08,231
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's one thing better than freedom of speech, it's nudity.

730
00:59:08,831 --> 00:59:11,792
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's some titties to be found in fucking Heavy Rain.

731
00:59:12,212 --> 00:59:12,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the deal.

732
00:59:13,472 --> 00:59:18,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't try to spoil the story too bad, but there is a love scene that happens at one point in the game.

733
00:59:18,493 --> 00:59:22,314
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it should be fucking obvious if you've seen some of the previous of the game that it kind of pushes the envelope.

734
00:59:22,674 --> 00:59:23,655
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a love scene.

735
00:59:24,036 --> 00:59:34,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if you decline the kiss and trigger the sequence anyway and reload your saved game right away, then you'll have the female lead running around, titties flapping around.

736
00:59:36,551 --> 00:59:38,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything is all just hanging out.

737
00:59:39,054 --> 00:59:39,735
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

738
00:59:39,895 --> 00:59:41,717
[SPEAKER_04]: You can run around and play naked.

739
00:59:43,688 --> 00:59:49,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, of course, the naked model was not made in the game to be run around and play naked.

740
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:52,531
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a shower scene that happens in the story.

741
00:59:52,571 --> 00:59:53,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I saw this.

742
00:59:55,672 --> 01:00:02,854
[SPEAKER_04]: What's interesting, here's the fucking part I think is interesting, though, is that, you know, since everybody gets all fucking bent out of shape because of nudity, specifically the ESRB.

743
01:00:03,394 --> 01:00:05,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this game going to go back to the board for an AO rating?

744
01:00:06,076 --> 01:00:11,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't this the same fucking thing that happened in Oblivion for the PC version ended up getting pulled and fucking rated AO?

745
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:23,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Because even though you weren't supposed to be able to ever see the titties, the titties were there because they fucking would use them to base like a sheer top on.

746
01:00:23,226 --> 01:00:39,955
[SPEAKER_04]: I think though that it's still okay because you actually do see that model in the game it's just now that you're using that model for more than just that one scene but isn't I mean for whatever reason I think it's fucking stupid but the the fucks out there that rate things are like there's a big difference between a butt

747
01:00:40,695 --> 01:00:41,295
[SPEAKER_04]: and a pussy.

748
01:00:42,576 --> 01:00:44,638
[SPEAKER_04]: All that is is 180 degrees.

749
01:00:45,118 --> 01:00:56,306
[SPEAKER_19]: If that model wasn't in the game, if it was just like she's behind a shower curtain or something like that and they're just using that model for a silhouette or something, that's different.

750
01:00:56,506 --> 01:00:59,848
[SPEAKER_19]: But you actually use this model in the game for one of the scenes.

751
01:00:59,888 --> 01:01:02,189
[SPEAKER_19]: You actually see her completely naked.

752
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:06,792
[SPEAKER_19]: If they're going to argue anything, it's going to be fucking duration.

753
01:01:08,053 --> 01:01:10,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Why didn't they just do the Sims pixel thing?

754
01:01:10,835 --> 01:01:11,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch.

755
01:01:11,416 --> 01:01:13,138
[SPEAKER_04]: I miss fucking Cleo right here.

756
01:01:13,258 --> 01:01:13,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch.

757
01:01:14,138 --> 01:01:27,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Next week on the fucking show, there's gonna be a story about some mother filing a fucking lawsuit against because they fucking found this in the game because their kid read about this on the internet on one of the gaming blogs.

758
01:01:28,132 --> 01:01:33,117
[SPEAKER_04]: So they fucking go in and unlock the character and suddenly mom walks in and there's some fucking titties on the screen.

759
01:01:33,437 --> 01:02:02,254
[SPEAKER_19]: and she fucking loses her shit not knowing that that's the game she bought for her kid and there's a fucking lawsuit next week's show, that'll be a story if not next week, two weeks but the nudity's in the game already it would be just the same as it would be just I'm watching it it would be just the same as if he didn't do this mod or whatever and you know if they didn't do the mod or whatever and just the shower scene it would be exactly the same

760
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:07,852
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you're right that there's no basis, but I don't know.

761
01:02:07,912 --> 01:02:09,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Her boobs don't move like real boobs, though.

762
01:02:09,393 --> 01:02:10,033
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a feeling.

763
01:02:10,774 --> 01:02:14,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't think you were ever supposed to be able to just fucking walk her around and shit like that.

764
01:02:14,416 --> 01:02:16,137
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, uncanny valley my ass.

765
01:02:17,898 --> 01:02:19,259
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry, that does not look real.

766
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:23,002
[SPEAKER_04]: We need some real looking titties.

767
01:02:23,362 --> 01:02:25,343
[SPEAKER_04]: We need Team Ninja to fix this.

768
01:02:25,383 --> 01:02:31,447
[SPEAKER_19]: We have range of motion in the face, but where is the range of motion in the fucking titties?

769
01:02:32,566 --> 01:02:33,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Not there.

770
01:02:33,987 --> 01:02:37,311
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura's got a fucking new story for us, then we'll get into some fucking release dates.

771
01:02:38,332 --> 01:02:39,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, fucking story.

772
01:02:40,113 --> 01:02:42,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy fucking birthday, PlayStation 2.

773
01:02:42,796 --> 01:02:45,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, I totally want someone to make me a PS2 cake.

774
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:47,220
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be cool.

775
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:47,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

776
01:02:49,822 --> 01:02:52,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, ten years ago, PS2 launched in Japan.

777
01:02:53,346 --> 01:02:53,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

778
01:02:54,667 --> 01:02:55,508
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a Japanese PS2.

779
01:02:56,926 --> 01:02:57,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Me too.

780
01:02:58,007 --> 01:02:59,848
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the first model one and it still works.

781
01:03:00,028 --> 01:03:00,888
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought mine.

782
01:03:01,388 --> 01:03:02,869
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know if mine still fucking works.

783
01:03:02,909 --> 01:03:03,910
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't touched it in years.

784
01:03:03,970 --> 01:03:05,010
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought it a little ways later.

785
01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:09,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought it for Beatmania 2DX 6th style because I was fucking addicted to 2DX for a while.

786
01:03:09,613 --> 01:03:15,456
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's what we got ours for too and that and playing some of the few JRPGs that I had.

787
01:03:15,476 --> 01:03:19,959
[SPEAKER_04]: But some of the fucking cool kids in town, they had their PS2s for 3rd and 4th style.

788
01:03:20,259 --> 01:03:24,101
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't get on that train until about 6th style was my first fucking Beatmania game.

789
01:03:24,261 --> 01:03:28,544
[SPEAKER_07]: The big thing that gets me on this one is that there actually are people that still use their PS2.

790
01:03:28,864 --> 01:03:31,166
[SPEAKER_07]: There's still PS2 games being released.

791
01:03:31,786 --> 01:03:33,828
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're looking at a 10-year-old system.

792
01:03:35,109 --> 01:03:39,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that funny that people never fucking believe that the PlayStation 3 has a 10-year life cycle?

793
01:03:39,412 --> 01:03:40,893
[SPEAKER_04]: And people go, that's too fucking long.

794
01:03:41,213 --> 01:03:42,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at the PS2.

795
01:03:42,093 --> 01:03:43,895
[SPEAKER_04]: It is still fucking going after 10 years.

796
01:03:44,135 --> 01:03:44,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

797
01:03:45,316 --> 01:03:46,997
[SPEAKER_04]: So a 10-year life cycle is very viable.

798
01:03:47,017 --> 01:03:50,319
[SPEAKER_04]: It's at the end of its life cycle, but yes, it's still going.

799
01:03:50,379 --> 01:03:51,940
[SPEAKER_04]: So it needs to be put down, you know?

800
01:03:53,141 --> 01:03:54,963
[SPEAKER_04]: So, well, happy fucking birthday, PlayStation 2.

801
01:03:55,443 --> 01:03:58,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Just really fucking quick, just kind of reminiscing a minute here.

802
01:03:58,786 --> 01:04:06,412
[SPEAKER_04]: What would you guys say were some of the important PlayStation 2 moments for you that, like, had an impact on gaming for you?

803
01:04:07,213 --> 01:04:12,497
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like, as a Final Fantasy fanboy, I think playing fucking Final Fantasy X for the first time was a huge moment for me.

804
01:04:12,517 --> 01:04:13,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about you guys.

805
01:04:13,738 --> 01:04:15,980
[SPEAKER_04]: What was, like, a huge moment in PlayStation gaming for you?

806
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:17,281
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet I know Loki's.

807
01:04:18,241 --> 01:04:19,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Grand Theft Auto 3.

808
01:04:20,303 --> 01:04:21,964
[SPEAKER_04]: That was good, but Driver 3.

809
01:04:23,869 --> 01:04:25,829
[SPEAKER_19]: It introduced me to the lowest of the low.

810
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:27,870
[SPEAKER_19]: The guy game.

811
01:04:30,290 --> 01:04:31,171
[SPEAKER_07]: PS2 for me?

812
01:04:32,171 --> 01:04:33,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking Beatmania 2DX, sorry.

813
01:04:34,071 --> 01:04:40,072
[SPEAKER_07]: When I got my... I remember the day I beat everything on Light 7 in 5th style.

814
01:04:40,632 --> 01:04:41,913
[SPEAKER_07]: I freaking called everybody.

815
01:04:43,173 --> 01:04:44,993
[SPEAKER_07]: And posted it on my live journal.

816
01:04:45,493 --> 01:04:46,914
[SPEAKER_07]: I passed Regulus!

817
01:04:47,534 --> 01:04:48,614
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate Regulus!

818
01:04:48,714 --> 01:04:49,874
[SPEAKER_07]: I passed... No, it wasn't Regulus.

819
01:04:49,914 --> 01:04:52,835
[SPEAKER_07]: It was... What was the Light 7 version of Regulus?

820
01:04:55,237 --> 01:04:57,602
[SPEAKER_04]: I... I... I... Something into the lighter.

821
01:04:58,043 --> 01:04:58,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Right in the light?

822
01:04:58,625 --> 01:05:04,959
[SPEAKER_04]: But no... The... The really fucking hard songs I think were Sync and Regulus, yeah.

823
01:05:06,112 --> 01:05:07,413
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't fucking remember.

824
01:05:07,433 --> 01:05:08,673
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how many fucking years ago that was?

825
01:05:09,613 --> 01:05:10,574
[SPEAKER_04]: That's older than this show.

826
01:05:10,794 --> 01:05:20,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, now this is going to bother me, but just the day that I beat everything in Light Seven, though I still haven't done it in Fourth Style because of... No, I did beat that.

827
01:05:20,838 --> 01:05:21,978
[SPEAKER_07]: I beat everything in Fourth Style too.

828
01:05:22,018 --> 01:05:26,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Third Style I didn't because I couldn't beat... The Safari.

829
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:27,421
[SPEAKER_07]: The Safari, yeah.

830
01:05:28,161 --> 01:05:33,503
[SPEAKER_07]: But still, it was like, that was my squeal, I love the PS2 moment.

831
01:05:35,617 --> 01:05:42,611
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Synthetic fucking Koniko in our chatroom says Silent fucking Hill, oh my fucking god Yeah, yeah, yeah, Silent Hill 3

832
01:05:44,125 --> 01:05:47,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, FuckDeaf says, I got my PS2 for DDR and Kingdom Hearts.

833
01:05:47,866 --> 01:05:49,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Kingdom Hearts is pretty fucking epic.

834
01:05:49,867 --> 01:05:50,467
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for sure.

835
01:05:50,807 --> 01:05:51,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of good comments in our chat.

01:05:52,928 --> 01:05:54,709
[SPEAKER_04]: YYR says, Boo PS2.

[SPEAKER_04]: Boo.

839
01:05:55,529 --> 01:06:01,431
[SPEAKER_04]: I still dislike you because those of all the people who didn't buy or develop for the Dreamcast because they were waiting for you.

840
01:06:02,751 --> 01:06:06,072
[SPEAKER_04]: FuckingSharan says, Play Shadow of the fucking Colossus.

841
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:08,853
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a pretty epic game too.

842
01:06:09,273 --> 01:06:09,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Very fucking epic.

843
01:06:10,973 --> 01:06:26,177
[SPEAKER_04]: alright well happy fucking birthday PS2 and for those of you still playing the PS2 you might want to think about upgrading although I will say I do hope that the fucking backwards compatibility comes to the Playstation 3 at some point and I know this is a big fucking wrap around I don't want to dredge dirt mine has it

844
01:06:26,537 --> 01:06:26,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Zero!

845
01:06:26,637 --> 01:06:26,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Zero!

846
01:06:54,142 --> 01:06:55,083
[SPEAKER_19]: Zero.

847
01:06:55,203 --> 01:06:58,706
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought, oh yeah, I'm going to go back and play some Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

848
01:06:59,286 --> 01:06:59,466
[SPEAKER_19]: Nope.

849
01:07:00,027 --> 01:07:00,607
[SPEAKER_07]: We've played a few.

850
01:07:01,428 --> 01:07:02,429
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember what, but we have.

851
01:07:03,309 --> 01:07:06,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, Rob, crap.

852
01:07:06,872 --> 01:07:07,873
[SPEAKER_07]: What game was it you said?

853
01:07:08,073 --> 01:07:11,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you know, it reminded me of a game, a franchise that I wish they'd bring back.

854
01:07:11,936 --> 01:07:12,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Jumping Flash.

855
01:07:14,438 --> 01:07:16,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you imagine a PS3 Jumping Flash?

856
01:07:17,008 --> 01:07:17,988
[SPEAKER_19]: That would be fucking crack.

857
01:07:18,188 --> 01:07:18,968
[SPEAKER_19]: That would be epic.

858
01:07:19,128 --> 01:07:19,669
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what else?

859
01:07:20,309 --> 01:07:25,750
[SPEAKER_19]: I've played a lot of games on my Xbox 360 backwards compatibility as well.

860
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:27,590
[SPEAKER_19]: A whopping zero!

861
01:07:28,070 --> 01:07:28,811
[SPEAKER_19]: None!

862
01:07:29,371 --> 01:07:29,931
[SPEAKER_19]: And you know why?

863
01:07:29,991 --> 01:07:31,931
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I have an Xbox 360.

864
01:07:32,111 --> 01:07:33,412
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm buying new games for it.

865
01:07:33,572 --> 01:07:34,972
[SPEAKER_04]: I've played Halo 2 a few times.

866
01:07:35,592 --> 01:07:36,212
[SPEAKER_19]: Eh, no.

867
01:07:36,712 --> 01:07:38,573
[SPEAKER_07]: We've also used it for a few games.

868
01:07:38,793 --> 01:07:40,253
[SPEAKER_07]: You're so fucking nuts.

869
01:07:40,293 --> 01:07:41,953
[SPEAKER_07]: I did use my PS2 a lot for PS1 games.

870
01:07:44,834 --> 01:07:47,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Mostly for my Japanese one to play my import, so I didn't have to.

871
01:07:47,996 --> 01:07:50,317
[SPEAKER_04]: I might want to go get Shadow of the Colossus again.

872
01:07:50,457 --> 01:07:54,380
[SPEAKER_04]: I play PS1 games on my PS3, but mostly the PSP.

873
01:07:54,600 --> 01:08:00,323
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that one game of the guy with the big fro that we were playing at All Games Lounge?

874
01:08:03,025 --> 01:08:03,365
[SPEAKER_04]: On PS1?

875
01:08:03,565 --> 01:08:05,446
[SPEAKER_07]: On PS1, but it was playing on a PS3.

876
01:08:06,967 --> 01:08:07,587
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

877
01:08:07,647 --> 01:08:10,509
[SPEAKER_07]: That game was cracked out, but now I can't remember the name of it.

878
01:08:11,434 --> 01:08:11,874
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

879
01:08:12,294 --> 01:08:13,395
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a long fucking time ago.

880
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:15,635
[SPEAKER_04]: You really tested my fucking memory on this show, DarkSakura.

881
01:08:15,655 --> 01:08:17,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Or God Hand might be good.

882
01:08:17,316 --> 01:08:18,416
[SPEAKER_04]: But I didn't play that one either.

883
01:08:18,656 --> 01:08:20,237
[SPEAKER_04]: How about some fucking release dates?

884
01:08:20,297 --> 01:08:22,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's travel the globe and check out some release dates.

885
01:08:24,038 --> 01:08:26,059
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sure there's something fucking coming out this week.

886
01:08:27,179 --> 01:08:30,240
[SPEAKER_19]: Something's finally coming out.

887
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,641
[SPEAKER_19]: It'd be fantastic.

888
01:08:34,332 --> 01:08:36,454
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for watching!

889
01:08:56,414 --> 01:08:58,335
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, so other stuff coming out.

890
01:08:58,375 --> 01:09:00,637
[SPEAKER_19]: 50 classic games on the DS.

891
01:09:01,058 --> 01:09:03,159
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I'm thinking that there's games in there somewhere.

892
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:05,401
[SPEAKER_19]: Resident Evil 5 Gold Edition.

893
01:09:05,521 --> 01:09:08,023
[SPEAKER_19]: It's Resident Evil 5 but better with more stuff.

894
01:09:08,303 --> 01:09:09,724
[SPEAKER_19]: Yay!

895
01:09:09,825 --> 01:09:10,525
[SPEAKER_19]: And slightly cheaper.

896
01:09:11,506 --> 01:09:13,427
[SPEAKER_19]: Sam & Max 2 Beyond Time and Space.

897
01:09:14,528 --> 01:09:16,610
[SPEAKER_19]: Coming out as a compilation on PC and Wii.

898
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:18,752
[SPEAKER_19]: In case you didn't buy them all separately.

899
01:09:20,394 --> 01:09:35,636
[SPEAKER_19]: uh Colleen on the Nintendo Wii which shares cover art almost with Final not Final Fantasy with uh obsessed much are we yes Final Fantasy Final Fantasy no um

900
01:09:37,102 --> 01:09:39,863
[SPEAKER_19]: Now it shares box art with almost Silent Hill.

901
01:09:40,763 --> 01:09:44,664
[SPEAKER_19]: And it looks Silent Hill-ish, maybe, but it's not.

902
01:09:45,444 --> 01:09:47,564
[SPEAKER_19]: Photo Showdown for the DSi.

903
01:09:47,604 --> 01:09:49,124
[SPEAKER_19]: That's right, DSi, not DS.

904
01:09:49,665 --> 01:09:59,547
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a game sort of like Monster Rancher, except you use the pictures that you take with your DSi camera, and based on the colors that are in there, it creates different monsters.

905
01:09:59,847 --> 01:10:03,667
[SPEAKER_19]: Not quite as cool as, you know, putting random CDs in your PlayStation 2.

906
01:10:03,767 --> 01:10:04,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Or the barcode scanner.

907
01:10:05,148 --> 01:10:06,388
[SPEAKER_19]: Or the barcode scanner, yes, that's true.

908
01:10:08,149 --> 01:10:09,591
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, we need to bring back the barcode scanners.

909
01:10:10,492 --> 01:10:13,196
[SPEAKER_19]: Assassin's Creed 2 coming on PC this week.

910
01:10:14,337 --> 01:10:15,378
[SPEAKER_19]: Wait a second.

911
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:17,201
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm confused.

912
01:10:19,196 --> 01:10:19,676
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

913
01:10:44,204 --> 01:10:44,945
[SPEAKER_19]: The Daring Game for Girls

914
01:11:03,663 --> 01:11:05,865
[SPEAKER_07]: What, like pillow fights and braiding each other's hair?

915
01:11:06,365 --> 01:11:07,066
[SPEAKER_19]: Something like that.

916
01:11:07,486 --> 01:11:08,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Count me out.

917
01:11:09,288 --> 01:11:18,556
[SPEAKER_19]: Yakuza 3, coming out on PlayStation 3, and this of course is a game that's getting lots of controversy for stuff that they've localized and removed.

918
01:11:19,356 --> 01:11:23,140
[SPEAKER_19]: Apparently people like their Japanese trivia and bar hostesses.

919
01:11:24,241 --> 01:11:24,341
[SPEAKER_19]: Um...

920
01:11:25,882 --> 01:11:31,985
[SPEAKER_19]: And then, of course, later on this week, BlazBlue Calamity Trigger coming to PSP.

921
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:33,306
[SPEAKER_19]: That's going to be pretty awesome.

922
01:11:34,466 --> 01:11:41,350
[SPEAKER_19]: On PC, Warhammer 40K Dawn of War 2, the Gold Edition, kind of a re-release compilation of those games.

923
01:11:41,770 --> 01:11:46,653
[SPEAKER_19]: And then also the new expansion will be coming out for that, Dawn of War 2 Chaos Rising.

924
01:11:47,593 --> 01:11:54,458
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, if you want some real-time strategy on your 360 coming from Square Enix, Supreme Commander 2 will be making its way out in 360.

925
01:11:54,898 --> 01:11:59,081
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, on the DS, Spectral Force Genesis finally coming out.

926
01:12:00,302 --> 01:12:14,051
[SPEAKER_19]: And, uh, about a week from today, we get our Pokemans with, uh, Pokemon SoulSilver and Pokemon HeartGold, each coming with a stupid pedometer because, guess what, Nintendo wants you to fucking exercise, including Pokemon trainers.

927
01:12:14,071 --> 01:12:15,031
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's it.

928
01:12:15,051 --> 01:12:16,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

929
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:20,577
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, it's a pretty fucking busy week in Japan, which is good because they've had a lot of slow weeks lately.

930
01:12:20,637 --> 01:12:22,279
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of fucking releases for you guys.

931
01:12:22,579 --> 01:12:24,862
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of fucking price drops on the 360 in Japan.

932
01:12:25,162 --> 01:12:27,725
[SPEAKER_04]: BlazBlue, Dream Club, Dead Rising.

933
01:12:27,745 --> 01:12:29,527
[SPEAKER_04]: It's BlazBlue, not BlazBlue.

934
01:12:29,547 --> 01:12:31,169
[SPEAKER_04]: I always say BlazBlue.

935
01:12:31,209 --> 01:12:32,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is the fucking E?

936
01:12:32,370 --> 01:12:33,171
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't need one.

937
01:12:33,211 --> 01:12:33,892
[SPEAKER_07]: It's stylistic.

938
01:12:34,732 --> 01:12:58,907
[SPEAKER_04]: BlazBlue It's marketing Fine Then fucking spell the game name right in the future BlazBlue, Dead Rising, Dream Club, Halo Wars, Lost Planet Colonies, Otomedia's Gorgeous All of those fucking games getting price drops in Japan this week on the 360 Some new games coming out as well including Red Seeds Profile Which kind of looks like a Silent Hill-ish kind of game It takes place in a remote village but this time in Canada It's supposed to be like 150 people there

939
01:13:00,268 --> 01:13:29,564
[SPEAKER_04]: and then they find a body and it's about the killer in the rain, da da da, and you're an FBI agent, so I don't know if it's like their answer to Heavy Rain or what, but it kind of just looks like one of those scary thriller type of games, so that is on 360 this week, and then another game called Akatsuki no Amanika To Aikaijin comes out this week as well it's one of those cute girl comedy type games, it's not like a dating sim but it's just kind of like one of those adventure games with cute little anime girls in bikinis and all that stuff, so

940
01:13:30,304 --> 01:13:31,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Super fan service there on the 360.

941
01:13:32,726 --> 01:13:34,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably won't come out to America.

942
01:13:34,127 --> 01:13:34,767
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a game.

943
01:13:34,787 --> 01:13:35,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Super fan service.

944
01:13:35,908 --> 01:13:36,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Super fan service.

945
01:13:37,629 --> 01:13:48,996
[SPEAKER_04]: On the PlayStation 3 this week, Blaze Blue also gets a price reduction there, as well as Initial D Extreme Stage.

946
01:13:49,596 --> 01:13:55,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Red Seed's profile makes its way out as well in Japan, and Battlefield Bad Company 2 also comes out in Japan.

947
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that mean you have to wage battle with the band Bad Company?

948
01:13:59,997 --> 01:14:01,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

949
01:14:15,607 --> 01:14:21,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Summon Night Grand Thesis, Horobi no Ken to Yakusuku no Kishi.

950
01:14:21,289 --> 01:14:23,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck, they have some long names for games out there.

951
01:14:23,490 --> 01:14:25,391
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an RPG game on the PlayStation 2.

952
01:14:26,711 --> 01:14:29,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, looks very anime-heavy influenced.

953
01:14:29,492 --> 01:14:31,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Multi-hit combos, though, in some of the sequences.

954
01:14:31,993 --> 01:14:37,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Some really kind of pretty-looking DVD-ish style cutscenes in a very anime style.

955
01:14:38,675 --> 01:14:42,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like, although it's RPG, it might be a little bit action-based in its battles there.

956
01:14:43,337 --> 01:14:48,076
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, they need to have more games with the word Grand Thesis in the title.

957
01:14:50,430 --> 01:14:51,231
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck ever.

958
01:14:51,331 --> 01:14:51,611
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

959
01:14:52,351 --> 01:14:52,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

960
01:14:52,912 --> 01:14:54,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Other games coming out this week.

961
01:14:54,633 --> 01:14:56,254
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm checking the fucking handhelds real quick.

962
01:14:56,654 --> 01:15:05,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony PSP gets Battle Spirits Hero Soul, Shin Sangoku Mosu Multi-Raid 2, Zetai Hero Kaizu Kekiaku.

963
01:15:05,399 --> 01:15:07,540
[SPEAKER_04]: All of those fucking games are out in Japan this week.

964
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:09,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Also out this week, Eye of Judgment Legends.

965
01:15:10,482 --> 01:15:11,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Not in Japan, though, but that's in Asia.

966
01:15:11,883 --> 01:15:13,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are all on the fucking Sony PSP.

967
01:15:13,424 --> 01:15:18,227
[SPEAKER_19]: And I just need to fucking remind everybody that is not part of the deal because the game makes sense.

968
01:15:18,687 --> 01:15:20,869
[SPEAKER_19]: On a PSP because there's no camera peripheral.

969
01:15:21,870 --> 01:15:22,150
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

970
01:15:22,350 --> 01:15:29,455
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the Nintendo DS, one really big game this week, fucking worth noting, RPG Tsukuru DS.

971
01:15:30,176 --> 01:15:32,878
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an RPG maker game on the Nintendo DS.

972
01:15:33,058 --> 01:15:36,140
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of folks I know really are into those games.

973
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:36,781
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of cool.

974
01:15:36,821 --> 01:15:38,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, unfortunately, it's very Japanese heavy.

975
01:15:38,682 --> 01:15:44,226
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to have to know your Japanese if you want to fucking play this game or you're going to need to beg somebody to localize it.

976
01:15:44,347 --> 01:15:45,988
[SPEAKER_04]: EnterBrain is putting it out in Japan.

977
01:15:46,528 --> 01:15:47,369
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

978
01:15:47,429 --> 01:15:49,110
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I know that company over here.

979
01:15:49,791 --> 01:15:59,477
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, although it's technically next week, I should point out the DS releases are thinning out a little bit because next week is Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver are on their way on the Nintendo DS.

980
01:15:59,537 --> 01:16:01,099
[SPEAKER_04]: We know everybody fucking loves Pokemon.

981
01:16:01,999 --> 01:16:02,620
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

982
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:03,901
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it for Japan.

983
01:16:04,001 --> 01:16:05,362
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what the fuck for UK?

984
01:16:06,554 --> 01:16:08,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, a few fucking odds and ends.

985
01:16:09,055 --> 01:16:10,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy XIII on the 9th.

986
01:16:11,036 --> 01:16:13,417
[SPEAKER_07]: On the 10th, Scrap Metal for Xbox 360.

987
01:16:13,577 --> 01:16:17,918
[SPEAKER_07]: 12th is Benton Alien Force Viljax Attacks.

988
01:16:17,958 --> 01:16:18,718
[SPEAKER_07]: What the fuck is that?

989
01:16:19,919 --> 01:16:23,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Last Rebellion, Warhammer 40k, Dawn of War 2, Chaos Rising.

990
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:25,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Boo, Warhammer!

991
01:16:25,541 --> 01:16:28,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, you know what my problem with Warhammer is.

992
01:16:28,882 --> 01:16:29,602
[SPEAKER_07]: And Yakuza 3.

993
01:16:30,823 --> 01:16:31,803
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all the fuck there is.

994
01:16:34,594 --> 01:16:37,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, some more fucking news in the Classic Game of the Week.

995
01:16:37,995 --> 01:16:42,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody fucking loves the Classic Game of the Week, and I'm sure DarkSakura picked a pretty fucking good one this week.

996
01:16:42,936 --> 01:16:43,696
[SPEAKER_04]: She usually does.

997
01:16:44,057 --> 01:16:45,957
[SPEAKER_04]: But just a few more stories before we get there.

998
01:16:46,537 --> 01:16:49,018
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you could all use a break to wash your mouths out with soap.

999
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:55,219
[SPEAKER_19]: There's been some interesting fucking updates to the game Portal.

1000
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:57,820
[SPEAKER_19]: This week they had a couple updates.

1001
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you see the cover of Game Informer?

1002
01:16:59,441 --> 01:16:59,881
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I did.

1003
01:17:01,541 --> 01:17:03,082
[SPEAKER_19]: Jumping ahead of me here.

1004
01:17:04,722 --> 01:17:12,645
[SPEAKER_19]: So the first update that was out there was a patch that added some more radio dialogue, I guess.

1005
01:17:13,365 --> 01:17:17,187
[SPEAKER_19]: And there were some different messages that were in Morse code.

1006
01:17:17,687 --> 01:17:22,769
[SPEAKER_19]: Also some encoded messages with the numbers and equations in them.

1007
01:17:23,489 --> 01:17:28,352
[SPEAKER_19]: And this was all part of the radio that you would hear every now and then.

1008
01:17:28,633 --> 01:17:30,974
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it was also in the room that you started off in.

1009
01:17:32,675 --> 01:17:34,616
[SPEAKER_19]: And it was all kind of hinting different things.

1010
01:17:35,337 --> 01:17:44,322
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, the people that looked at those images or whatever that was in the little radio messages, it's kind of funny.

1011
01:17:44,643 --> 01:17:50,006
[SPEAKER_19]: They actually found a phone number for a BBS account.

1012
01:17:50,286 --> 01:17:53,788
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, those old things prior to the internet.

1013
01:17:53,808 --> 01:17:55,870
[SPEAKER_19]: I fucking loved BBS, dude.

1014
01:17:56,270 --> 01:18:01,453
[SPEAKER_04]: The Pit, fucking Trade Wars 2002, or was it 2020?

1015
01:18:01,713 --> 01:18:02,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

1016
01:18:02,233 --> 01:18:04,115
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, all those fucking games were amazing.

1017
01:18:04,575 --> 01:18:06,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Legend of the Red fucking Dragon, enough said.

1018
01:18:06,756 --> 01:18:13,083
[SPEAKER_19]: And then on, of course, those BBSs, they found ASCII art featuring some stuff.

1019
01:18:13,484 --> 01:18:17,448
[SPEAKER_19]: Looks like different robots and whatever from possibly Portal 2.

1020
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:20,191
[SPEAKER_19]: Very interesting looking.

1021
01:18:20,352 --> 01:18:20,532
[SPEAKER_19]: Some...

1022
01:18:21,653 --> 01:18:27,675
[SPEAKER_19]: Apparently this is going to be some sort of ARG type of thing, so that'll be kind of neat.

1023
01:18:27,715 --> 01:18:31,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh god, I just realized not all our chatters know what a BBS is.

1024
01:18:31,196 --> 01:18:32,097
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I feel old.

1025
01:18:32,137 --> 01:18:34,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I'm really fucking sorry for not explaining it.

1026
01:18:34,278 --> 01:18:41,000
[SPEAKER_04]: But BBS is, okay, back before there was the internet, or if you want to get technical, the internet existed then, but it was only for fucking government people and stuff.

1027
01:18:41,420 --> 01:19:08,580
[SPEAKER_04]: so back when like I was in fucking high school and probably about the time it's a bulletin board system yeah but you would have to dial in with a modem some guy would fucking host it on their computer or gal and you would dial in on your modem and connect to it and then it was kind of like it had forums and a lot of the stuff that you kind of see in a new forum on the internet today but you know it was a very community type of thing you didn't usually talk to people because you know people didn't want to call long distance and run up their phone bills so it was a very local thing usually

1028
01:19:09,229 --> 01:19:09,889
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1029
01:19:26,214 --> 01:19:32,298
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, they had shareware, which is, you know, kind of like a little... Take you 45 minutes to download the fucking Wolfenstein 3D demo.

1030
01:19:32,318 --> 01:19:34,520
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, like a demo, you know, for a game.

1031
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:39,663
[SPEAKER_19]: Not really even a demo for a game, but it'd be like the first episode for a game would be like about five bucks or whatever.

1032
01:19:39,703 --> 01:19:48,069
[SPEAKER_19]: You would go, you know, buy a floppy disk from, you know, whatever retailer, and you would have the first... It'd be a full game, but it wouldn't be like the full, full game.

1033
01:19:48,089 --> 01:19:52,032
[SPEAKER_19]: You'd actually go buy, you know, a retail game, but it'd give you a really good idea of what the game was like.

1034
01:19:52,752 --> 01:19:59,297
[SPEAKER_19]: and, you know, you could go on these servers and sometimes they would host the full version of the game and you could download it for free.

1035
01:19:59,797 --> 01:20:12,786
[SPEAKER_19]: Or, like, you know, I would download, you know, back before MP3s, you know, mod files and stuff like that, you know, different electronica, you know, synthesized Amiga music files and stuff like that.

1036
01:20:13,646 --> 01:20:14,247
[SPEAKER_19]: Mods.

1037
01:20:14,647 --> 01:20:16,188
[SPEAKER_19]: So they would have, you know, all sorts of stuff.

1038
01:20:16,228 --> 01:20:18,069
[SPEAKER_19]: And I remember actually the first time that there was MP3s.

1039
01:20:18,189 --> 01:20:19,610
[SPEAKER_19]: I was like, holy shit, what's an MP3?

1040
01:20:19,630 --> 01:20:21,912
[SPEAKER_19]: So that was kind of cool.

1041
01:20:23,233 --> 01:20:31,358
[SPEAKER_19]: Back in the day, you used to go on there and sometimes they'd also have it where you could host multiplayer Doom games online and stuff like that.

1042
01:20:31,378 --> 01:20:32,639
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember that.

1043
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:33,780
[SPEAKER_19]: Doom 2 online.

1044
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:39,044
[SPEAKER_19]: This was back in the day with... This was all that we had.

1045
01:20:39,544 --> 01:20:40,625
[SPEAKER_19]: It was not the internet.

1046
01:20:40,665 --> 01:20:46,129
[SPEAKER_19]: It was like, which BBS can you get into and what cool files do they have on there?

1047
01:20:46,149 --> 01:20:50,272
[SPEAKER_19]: I had to download them in the Y protocol or the Z protocol, X protocol...

1048
01:20:51,877 --> 01:20:52,617
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1049
01:21:17,629 --> 01:21:19,731
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, the PC had a lot of support for it, too.

1050
01:21:19,811 --> 01:21:23,073
[SPEAKER_19]: They had, like, S3M, which is, like, Scream Tracker.

1051
01:21:23,313 --> 01:21:24,915
[SPEAKER_19]: Basically, it's tracker things.

1052
01:21:25,515 --> 01:21:32,940
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, it was like MIDI, where in the MIDI you trigger, you know, different instruments that are hard-coded into your sound card.

1053
01:21:35,302 --> 01:21:43,946
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, mods, what they were is it was basically different sample files, like WAV files that you put in there, and it was triggered like MIDI was.

1054
01:21:44,026 --> 01:21:53,990
[SPEAKER_19]: So you would have, like, you know, people could record their voice, record, like, actual guitars and stuff like that, and it would be triggered, and you could create, you know, electrical music or electronic music with that.

1055
01:21:55,615 --> 01:21:58,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anything else you wanted to say about Portal before we go to the next story?

1056
01:21:58,636 --> 01:22:02,838
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyways, yeah, so to get back into Portal, yeah, there's some pretty cool stuff coming out.

1057
01:22:04,178 --> 01:22:09,821
[SPEAKER_19]: They also added an extended ending to Portal, which kind of made it creepy.

1058
01:22:10,261 --> 01:22:18,184
[SPEAKER_19]: You may remember, if you finish the game, and a lot of people have, you end up kind of outside while the whole lab kind of...

1059
01:22:18,764 --> 01:22:19,664
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, for your party.

1060
01:22:41,204 --> 01:22:42,685
[SPEAKER_19]: S-Corp Party Position

1061
01:23:04,331 --> 01:23:07,874
[SPEAKER_19]: And of course, it was already confirmed by Game Informer.

1062
01:23:07,934 --> 01:23:09,715
[SPEAKER_19]: Their cover is actually Portal 2.

1063
01:23:10,376 --> 01:23:18,803
[SPEAKER_19]: And it shows, kind of, looks like Aperture Science was just like all these vines and stuff growing from the outside, kind of in through portals and stuff like that.

1064
01:23:19,204 --> 01:23:28,251
[SPEAKER_19]: What's going to be kind of unique about it, the game will be coming out on PlayStation, or not PlayStation, PC, Xbox 360, and Mac platforms.

1065
01:23:29,032 --> 01:23:31,174
[SPEAKER_19]: And it will be two-player co-op.

1066
01:23:32,805 --> 01:23:36,547
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's going to have some interesting looking things in there.

1067
01:23:37,128 --> 01:23:37,528
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice.

1068
01:23:38,829 --> 01:23:39,309
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

1069
01:23:39,329 --> 01:23:41,971
[SPEAKER_19]: If you want to learn more about that course, check out the latest game form.

1070
01:23:42,571 --> 01:23:48,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, in other first-person shooter news, if you still can't fucking tear yourself away from Halo 2, you don't have much time left.

1071
01:23:48,955 --> 01:23:49,615
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still coming.

1072
01:23:49,695 --> 01:23:50,516
[SPEAKER_04]: April 15th.

1073
01:23:50,596 --> 01:23:51,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, guys.

1074
01:23:51,596 --> 01:23:56,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Your attempts to try and fucking change your mind haven't worked because they are shutting it down April 15th.

1075
01:23:57,660 --> 01:23:58,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1076
01:24:13,049 --> 01:24:27,772
[SPEAKER_04]: 3 months of Xbox Live Gold and 400 Microsoft Points Now if you think, oh shit I should run online and play Halo 2 real quick Sorry, you're probably not going to get it now They probably did it for people that had played X number of hours in the past month But

1077
01:24:28,492 --> 01:24:31,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Still kind of pretty fucking cool of Microsoft to do, I suppose.

1078
01:24:31,135 --> 01:24:33,617
[SPEAKER_04]: It's better than what they're required to do, which is nothing.

1079
01:24:34,137 --> 01:24:42,705
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm sure there's a lot of people that are going to be fucking happy that they can get some bonuses there if they're not too fucking pissed off about Halo 2 going away.

1080
01:24:43,165 --> 01:24:44,006
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

1081
01:24:45,387 --> 01:24:51,550
[SPEAKER_04]: What would be really fucking nice of Microsoft to do would be to just say, you know, if you want to run your own private servers, here you go.

1082
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:54,032
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess you can't really do that on the Xbox 360.

1083
01:24:54,552 --> 01:24:56,914
[SPEAKER_04]: And Halo 2 is not going away on the PC.

1084
01:24:57,034 --> 01:24:57,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Something to remember.

1085
01:24:58,074 --> 01:25:03,818
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you really want to cling to your Halo 2 for dear life, remember you can't always play on the PC.

1086
01:25:04,989 --> 01:25:05,569
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1087
01:25:30,098 --> 01:25:33,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, in Europe, it was called Grisor.

1088
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:36,321
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, it was put up by Konami.

1089
01:25:36,502 --> 01:25:38,843
[SPEAKER_07]: It was originally on the arcade and came out for the NES.

1090
01:25:39,763 --> 01:25:42,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, for the PAL region, came out as Probotector.

1091
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:45,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me, I burped on the mic.

1092
01:25:45,366 --> 01:25:48,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and it also came out for the MSX, too.

1093
01:25:48,488 --> 01:25:49,388
[SPEAKER_07]: And there are a bunch of sequels.

1094
01:25:49,789 --> 01:25:52,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, I mean, who doesn't remember Super C, right?

1095
01:25:54,114 --> 01:26:01,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so basically you are these guys called Bill and Lance who work for Red Falcon and are trying to stop an alien invasion.

1096
01:26:02,059 --> 01:26:06,061
[SPEAKER_02]: And Bill and Lance like to run around with no shirts on and carrying big guns.

1097
01:26:08,002 --> 01:26:09,043
[SPEAKER_07]: They wear vests, Rob.

1098
01:26:09,343 --> 01:26:09,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Vests.

1099
01:26:09,543 --> 01:26:10,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Not in the game.

1100
01:26:11,044 --> 01:26:11,805
[SPEAKER_07]: And wear headbands.

1101
01:26:12,985 --> 01:26:13,326
[SPEAKER_07]: They do.

1102
01:26:13,506 --> 01:26:14,586
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't help it if it's hot.

1103
01:26:17,888 --> 01:26:18,709
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not about fucking.

1104
01:26:19,778 --> 01:26:21,840
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, you can get a whole bunch of different guns.

1105
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:29,325
[SPEAKER_07]: You get a machine gun, a laser gun, a fire gun, a spread gun, rapid fire power-up, all kinds of different fun stuff.

1106
01:26:29,985 --> 01:26:45,716
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you also, besides having the typical side-scrolling levels, you also have a behind-the-back sort of 3D maze level where you have to go in a certain order and go through the bases, defenses, and get to the end.

1107
01:26:45,776 --> 01:26:47,117
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's really fucking hard!

1108
01:26:48,416 --> 01:26:49,596
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, seriously, it's hard.

1109
01:26:50,076 --> 01:27:00,439
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't use the Konami code and have somebody else playing with you and you can beat this game without dying, I want to meet you and have you sign my arm or something.

1110
01:27:00,819 --> 01:27:10,161
[SPEAKER_04]: YYR in chat is trying to show off his big fucking skills saying, cleared both Contra and Super C on NES without 10 or 30 lives and without continues.

1111
01:27:10,241 --> 01:27:10,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Who else?

1112
01:27:10,681 --> 01:27:11,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but did you die?

1113
01:27:13,322 --> 01:27:14,903
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to meet the person who can do it without dying.

1114
01:27:15,483 --> 01:27:16,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't Dan do it without dying?

1115
01:27:17,824 --> 01:27:18,845
[SPEAKER_07]: No, actually.

1116
01:27:18,925 --> 01:27:20,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I fucking thought he could.

1117
01:27:20,246 --> 01:27:21,467
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that's why you fucking married him.

1118
01:27:21,848 --> 01:27:24,250
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it was our type that he could beat without dying.

1119
01:27:24,310 --> 01:27:25,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, gotcha.

1120
01:27:26,132 --> 01:27:30,696
[SPEAKER_07]: It also came out on the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC.

1121
01:27:30,936 --> 01:27:33,078
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, I need to ask you about Commodore 64 stuff, Rob.

1122
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:36,021
[SPEAKER_04]: I fucking love the Commodore 64.

1123
01:27:36,261 --> 01:27:37,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have a good emulator?

1124
01:27:38,697 --> 01:27:40,499
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't used one in a long time.

1125
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:43,621
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping the game room is going to bring back some of the C64 stuff.

1126
01:27:43,861 --> 01:27:45,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Wii's done a pretty shitty job.

1127
01:27:45,743 --> 01:27:46,463
[SPEAKER_07]: It's for someone else.

1128
01:27:47,204 --> 01:27:50,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

1129
01:27:50,707 --> 01:27:52,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Those versions all came out in Europe in 1988.

1130
01:27:54,549 --> 01:27:57,792
[SPEAKER_07]: The IBM PC version was also out in Germany.

1131
01:27:59,253 --> 01:28:03,957
[SPEAKER_07]: The Commodore 64 and IBM versions later came out in North America as Contra.

1132
01:28:04,997 --> 01:28:09,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but yeah, the NES version was evil and hard.

1133
01:28:10,182 --> 01:28:13,846
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was one of the earliest games to use the Konami code.

1134
01:28:14,566 --> 01:28:19,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, um, one of the other games that did it was, you know, before that was, of course, Gradius.

1135
01:28:20,732 --> 01:28:28,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and for the Falmicon, it used a multi-memory controller that, um, uh...

1136
01:28:30,534 --> 01:28:34,757
[SPEAKER_07]: and Konami made for the Japanese market that gave it additional graphical effects.

1137
01:28:34,777 --> 01:28:42,141
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know if anyone's ever played ROM of this, but if you play the Japanese ROM, there's animation in the background and other stuff going on.

1138
01:28:42,321 --> 01:28:46,783
[SPEAKER_07]: The leaves are moving and the grass is blowing in the wind and all kinds of fun stuff.

1139
01:28:47,744 --> 01:28:59,271
[SPEAKER_07]: And it also had extra cheat codes like a stage select and a sound test and hidden post-credits scene that you would hold select and start before and during the entire end credits.

1140
01:29:00,692 --> 01:29:06,163
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, like I said, the European version was called Probotector and the main guys were turned into robots.

1141
01:29:07,385 --> 01:29:09,870
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was just because of censorship laws in the day.

1142
01:29:10,411 --> 01:29:11,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck censorship.

1143
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:17,904
[SPEAKER_07]: But when Contra Legacy of War and Shattered Soldier came out, they retained the Contra name.

1144
01:29:19,965 --> 01:29:26,669
[SPEAKER_07]: MSX2 was actually fairly different than the arcade and the NES version because of limitations in the hardware.

1145
01:29:27,489 --> 01:29:29,811
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't scroll, but it used flip screens.

1146
01:29:30,491 --> 01:29:32,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Sort of the way that Metal Gear and Vampire Killer did.

1147
01:29:33,273 --> 01:29:34,473
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was only single player.

1148
01:29:35,814 --> 01:29:42,198
[SPEAKER_07]: However, it did change the last 10 stages of the game.

1149
01:29:42,678 --> 01:29:47,241
[SPEAKER_07]: And the MSX2 version of Contra is on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan.

1150
01:29:47,261 --> 01:29:49,362
[SPEAKER_07]: It came out on February 2nd of this year.

1151
01:29:50,383 --> 01:29:54,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, there was a PS2 re-release version for Xbox Live Arcade.

1152
01:29:55,045 --> 01:29:56,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Digital Eclipse handled the conversion.

1153
01:29:56,706 --> 01:30:00,669
[SPEAKER_07]: There's Konami Classics Series Arcade hits for the DS.

1154
01:30:01,029 --> 01:30:01,970
[SPEAKER_07]: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1155
01:30:02,450 --> 01:30:02,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1156
01:30:04,271 --> 01:30:20,023
[SPEAKER_07]: and you can actually get the Konami's Collector Series Castlevania and Contra for Windows in North America which also includes Super C and 3 Castlevania games and if you get Contra 4 Contra and Super C is also included that's the DS

1157
01:30:20,723 --> 01:30:21,203
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

1158
01:30:21,664 --> 01:30:22,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty freaking hard.

1159
01:30:25,205 --> 01:30:27,627
[SPEAKER_07]: And, of course, there were a ton of Contra games that came after.

1160
01:30:27,667 --> 01:30:31,769
[SPEAKER_07]: There was Super Contra.

1161
01:30:31,789 --> 01:30:34,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Super C. It was Super Contra overseas.

1162
01:30:34,770 --> 01:30:35,711
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Super C here.

1163
01:30:37,352 --> 01:30:39,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Operation C for the Game Boy.

1164
01:30:39,393 --> 01:30:41,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Contra 3, The Alien Wars for Super NES.

1165
01:30:41,994 --> 01:30:43,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Contra Force for NES.

1166
01:30:43,575 --> 01:30:47,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Contra Hardcore, which that's really actually kind of hard, too, on Genesis.

1167
01:30:48,197 --> 01:30:48,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1168
01:30:51,598 --> 01:30:52,759
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the Super Nintendo one.

1169
01:30:53,079 --> 01:30:53,679
[SPEAKER_04]: That was awesome.

1170
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:59,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Konami contracted out for PlayStation Contra Legacy of War, which also came out on the Saturn.

1171
01:31:00,660 --> 01:31:02,180
[SPEAKER_07]: See the Contra Adventure in 1998.

1172
01:31:03,661 --> 01:31:08,282
[SPEAKER_07]: 2000, we had Contra Shattered Soldier and Neo Contra.

1173
01:31:08,722 --> 01:31:10,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Contra 4 came out on the Nintendo DS.

1174
01:31:11,402 --> 01:31:15,123
[SPEAKER_07]: And Contra Rebirth by M2 came out for WiiWare.

1175
01:31:15,894 --> 01:31:19,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Our old fucking pal Kiriyamaoka did the music for Shattered Soldier, if I remember right.

1176
01:31:19,816 --> 01:31:20,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, he did.

1177
01:31:21,277 --> 01:31:27,700
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, if you were looking for any of the soundtracks from the arcade version of Contra, the soundtrack is included on Konami Game Music Vol.

1178
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:29,621
[SPEAKER_07]: 4, Ajax, which came out in 1988.

1179
01:31:29,782 --> 01:31:33,063
[SPEAKER_07]: There's actually a vinyl version of that, Rob.

1180
01:31:34,164 --> 01:31:35,124
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fucking old.

1181
01:31:35,625 --> 01:31:35,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1182
01:31:37,025 --> 01:31:38,026
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, Contra.

1183
01:31:39,435 --> 01:31:43,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, fucking great choice, and the chatroom's very fucking pleased with that.

1184
01:31:43,779 --> 01:31:46,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Contra is your classic game of the week.

1185
01:31:46,461 --> 01:31:53,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I totally recommend watching the Angry Nintendo Nerd, or Angry Gamer Nerd, his review of Contra.

1186
01:31:53,847 --> 01:31:54,948
[SPEAKER_07]: It's freaking hilarious.

1187
01:31:55,408 --> 01:31:57,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we're going to take a quick fucking break.

1188
01:31:57,730 --> 01:32:02,594
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio in just a little bit, so fucking don't go anywhere.

1189
01:32:03,154 --> 01:32:03,875
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be right back.

1190
01:32:17,150 --> 01:32:22,479
[SPEAKER_13]: Perhaps one of the most interesting words in the English language today is the word, fuck.

1191
01:32:23,627 --> 01:32:30,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Out of all of the English words that begin with the letter F, fuck is the only word that is referred to as the F word.

1192
01:32:30,953 --> 01:32:32,754
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the one magical word.

1193
01:32:33,255 --> 01:32:37,598
[SPEAKER_13]: Just by its sound can describe pain, pleasure, hate, and love.

1194
01:32:38,499 --> 01:32:45,125
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck, as most words in the English language, is derived from German, the word frichen, which means to strike.

1195
01:32:45,985 --> 01:32:49,428
[SPEAKER_13]: In English, fuck falls into many grammatical categories.

1196
01:32:50,148 --> 01:32:53,811
[SPEAKER_13]: As a transitive verb, for instance, John fucked Shirley.

1197
01:32:54,832 --> 01:32:57,393
[SPEAKER_13]: As an intransitive verb, Shirley fucks.

1198
01:32:58,354 --> 01:33:00,035
[SPEAKER_13]: Its meaning is not always sexual.

1199
01:33:00,376 --> 01:33:04,358
[SPEAKER_13]: It can be used as an adjective, such as, John's doing all the fucking work.

1200
01:33:05,524 --> 01:33:09,087
[SPEAKER_13]: As part of an adverb, Shirley talks too fucking much.

1201
01:33:10,068 --> 01:33:14,632
[SPEAKER_13]: As an adverb enhancing an adjective, Shirley is fucking beautiful.

1202
01:33:15,593 --> 01:33:17,995
[SPEAKER_13]: As a noun, I don't give a fuck.

1203
01:33:18,676 --> 01:33:23,320
[SPEAKER_13]: As part of a word, abso-fucking-lutely or infucking-credible.

1204
01:33:24,021 --> 01:33:28,425
[SPEAKER_13]: And as almost every word in a sentence, fuck the fucking fuckers.

1205
01:33:29,574 --> 01:33:33,195
[SPEAKER_13]: As you must realize, there aren't too many words with the versatility of fuck.

1206
01:33:33,895 --> 01:33:40,157
[SPEAKER_13]: As in these examples describing situations such as fraud, I got fucked at the used car lot.

1207
01:33:40,898 --> 01:33:42,778
[SPEAKER_13]: Dismay, aw fuck it.

1208
01:33:43,559 --> 01:33:46,339
[SPEAKER_13]: Trouble, I guess I'm really fucked now.

1209
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:49,520
[SPEAKER_13]: Aggression, don't fuck with me buddy.

1210
01:33:50,381 --> 01:33:53,802
[SPEAKER_13]: Difficulty, I don't understand this fucking question.

1211
01:33:54,702 --> 01:33:56,743
[SPEAKER_13]: Inquiry, who the fuck was that?

1212
01:33:57,723 --> 01:33:58,704
[SPEAKER_13]: Dissatisfaction.

1213
01:33:59,365 --> 01:34:01,326
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't like what the fuck is going on here.

1214
01:34:02,207 --> 01:34:02,928
[SPEAKER_13]: Incompetence.

1215
01:34:03,468 --> 01:34:04,509
[SPEAKER_13]: He's a fuck off.

1216
01:34:05,430 --> 01:34:06,051
[SPEAKER_13]: Dismissal.

1217
01:34:06,771 --> 01:34:09,854
[SPEAKER_13]: Why don't you go outside and play hide and go fuck yourself?

1218
01:34:10,815 --> 01:34:13,317
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure you can think of many more examples.

1219
01:34:14,238 --> 01:34:19,722
[SPEAKER_13]: With all of these multi-purpose applications, how can anyone be offended when you use the word?

1220
01:34:20,563 --> 01:34:25,547
[SPEAKER_13]: We say, use this unique, flexible word more often in your daily speech.

1221
01:34:26,187 --> 01:34:29,530
[SPEAKER_13]: It will identify the quality of your character immediately.

1222
01:34:30,451 --> 01:34:32,592
[SPEAKER_13]: Say it loudly and proudly.

1223
01:34:33,593 --> 01:34:34,474
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck you!

1224
01:34:38,084 --> 01:34:48,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this very special edition in celebration of our State Assembly wasting their fucking time passing a resolution to celebrate No Cussing Week.

1225
01:34:48,876 --> 01:34:53,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if it did fail in the Senate, it's still a waste of fucking everybody's time.

1226
01:34:53,061 --> 01:34:53,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, DarkSakura.

1227
01:34:55,264 --> 01:34:57,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you go play hide and go fuck yourself?

1228
01:34:57,706 --> 01:34:58,227
[SPEAKER_06]: That's okay.

1229
01:34:59,980 --> 01:35:00,640
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1230
01:35:15,290 --> 01:35:18,111
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I hear we're on against the fucking Oscars tonight.

1231
01:35:18,511 --> 01:35:24,933
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, who gives a fuck about a bunch of Hollywood people, uppity fucks, just sucking each other's dicks and giving each other awards.

1232
01:35:25,413 --> 01:35:37,057
[SPEAKER_19]: I forgot to submit my Oscar picks for a... Okay, so at my work we have this Oscar pool that we fucking do every year, and every fucking year I forget to submit them.

1233
01:35:37,857 --> 01:35:38,597
[SPEAKER_19]: I had it done.

1234
01:35:38,977 --> 01:35:40,638
[SPEAKER_19]: My co-worker fucking reminded me.

1235
01:35:41,718 --> 01:35:43,719
[SPEAKER_19]: I get home like, God damn it.

1236
01:35:44,199 --> 01:35:45,779
[SPEAKER_19]: I fucking forgot them again on my desk.

1237
01:35:45,859 --> 01:35:47,240
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not that fucking hard this year.

1238
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:50,281
[SPEAKER_19]: All my picks so far have been worse.

1239
01:35:51,001 --> 01:35:51,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, damn it!

1240
01:35:52,041 --> 01:35:53,522
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a two fucking movie race.

1241
01:35:53,562 --> 01:35:55,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though they upped it to ten, it's two.

1242
01:35:55,322 --> 01:35:55,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares?

1243
01:35:56,002 --> 01:35:57,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares about the Oscars?

1244
01:35:57,503 --> 01:35:58,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Hurt Locker's gonna win.

1245
01:35:58,383 --> 01:35:59,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't matter.

1246
01:35:59,904 --> 01:36:00,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't fucking matter.

1247
01:36:01,244 --> 01:36:02,545
[SPEAKER_04]: And besides, you don't have to fucking watch it.

1248
01:36:02,565 --> 01:36:03,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Just read it on the internet later.

1249
01:36:03,846 --> 01:36:05,287
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like four hours of bloated bullshit.

1250
01:36:05,307 --> 01:36:07,149
[SPEAKER_19]: Do what I do with American Idol results shows.

1251
01:36:07,329 --> 01:36:08,049
[SPEAKER_19]: You don't watch them.

1252
01:36:08,089 --> 01:36:09,791
[SPEAKER_19]: You just fucking read who wins.

1253
01:36:10,491 --> 01:36:10,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Or loses.

1254
01:36:10,671 --> 01:36:11,972
[SPEAKER_19]: Because they waste all the fucking time.

1255
01:36:12,173 --> 01:36:12,713
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, loses.

1256
01:36:12,733 --> 01:36:13,233
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what I meant.

1257
01:36:13,594 --> 01:36:13,954
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1258
01:36:16,016 --> 01:36:18,478
[SPEAKER_04]: YYR is like, oh, but what are they wearing?

1259
01:36:18,638 --> 01:36:19,779
[SPEAKER_04]: OMG, look at that gown.

1260
01:36:19,839 --> 01:36:20,619
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so daring.

1261
01:36:20,679 --> 01:36:22,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at how much skin they're bearing.

1262
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:24,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1263
01:36:26,149 --> 01:36:32,251
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll all be on fucking Perez Hilton and Oh No They Didn't and the OMG blogs, all the fashion shit.

1264
01:36:32,331 --> 01:36:33,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Tiger Claw's been keeping me updated.

1265
01:36:33,531 --> 01:36:34,171
[SPEAKER_04]: For those that care.

1266
01:36:34,851 --> 01:36:35,051
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1267
01:36:35,211 --> 01:36:37,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sending you private messages or something?

1268
01:36:37,352 --> 01:36:37,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1269
01:36:39,392 --> 01:36:41,253
[SPEAKER_04]: You really, you fucking care about the Oscars?

1270
01:36:41,493 --> 01:36:43,053
[SPEAKER_07]: I care to see what Star Trek wins.

1271
01:36:44,134 --> 01:36:46,914
[SPEAKER_19]: It's only going to win makeup because that was the only thing it was nominated for.

1272
01:36:46,954 --> 01:36:49,615
[SPEAKER_07]: But that is the first win for a Star Trek movie.

1273
01:36:50,576 --> 01:36:51,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I didn't know that.

1274
01:36:51,576 --> 01:36:55,638
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought even fucking Nemesis got nominated at least for like visual effects.

1275
01:36:55,698 --> 01:36:56,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, the first win.

1276
01:36:56,858 --> 01:36:57,118
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

1277
01:36:57,619 --> 01:36:57,839
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

1278
01:36:58,379 --> 01:37:01,880
[SPEAKER_07]: But actually, I do have to agree that Avatar did deserve Best Cinematography.

1279
01:37:03,681 --> 01:37:04,681
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck ever.

1280
01:37:04,761 --> 01:37:06,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to some fucking video game news.

1281
01:37:06,582 --> 01:37:06,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1282
01:37:08,064 --> 01:37:13,226
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, let's talk about some fucking sequels, including Scribblenauts 2.

1283
01:37:13,586 --> 01:37:18,928
[SPEAKER_19]: That's right, coming from the fucking source for Nintendo news, Nintendo fucking power.

1284
01:37:19,948 --> 01:37:26,170
[SPEAKER_19]: There will be another Scribblenauts game, and how can they fucking put out another one, you may ask, because there were so many words that were in there before.

1285
01:37:26,190 --> 01:37:29,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe because the first fucking game sold like fucking hotcakes.

1286
01:37:29,691 --> 01:37:30,932
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was a huge DS game.

1287
01:37:31,252 --> 01:37:32,553
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, here's how they're going to fucking do it.

1288
01:37:32,634 --> 01:37:35,396
[SPEAKER_19]: They're going to add 10,000 more words.

1289
01:37:35,436 --> 01:37:36,738
[SPEAKER_19]: That's right.

1290
01:37:37,298 --> 01:37:37,619
[SPEAKER_19]: 10,000 words.

1291
01:37:37,639 --> 01:37:39,541
[SPEAKER_19]: That's fucking more than 9,000.

1292
01:37:40,322 --> 01:37:41,883
[SPEAKER_19]: That's over 9,000 words.

1293
01:37:43,985 --> 01:37:47,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Just giving the... They were missing fucking 9,000 words before.

1294
01:37:47,489 --> 01:37:47,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently.

1295
01:37:47,909 --> 01:37:49,951
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be all internet memes this time.

1296
01:37:51,391 --> 01:37:51,631
[SPEAKER_19]: Baby Cthulhu

1297
01:38:04,761 --> 01:38:15,354
[SPEAKER_19]: Baby Cthulhu, you scare the shit out of me Over 9,000 It'll deliver 120 new levels, a level editor, a new hint system, and improved controls

1298
01:38:23,689 --> 01:38:26,830
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, better have improved controls because those controls sucked.

1299
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:30,230
[SPEAKER_19]: So, how about actual controls first?

1300
01:38:30,830 --> 01:38:33,171
[SPEAKER_19]: Another not-too-surprising sequel.

1301
01:38:33,211 --> 01:38:35,091
[SPEAKER_19]: In fact, I've known about this for a little bit.

1302
01:38:35,711 --> 01:38:43,793
[SPEAKER_19]: SOCOM 4 being announced for PlayStation 3 by Zipper, the company that developed it the last time around for SOCOM Confrontation.

1303
01:38:43,813 --> 01:38:49,874
[SPEAKER_19]: But this is an actual sequel this time, and apparently it's going to deliver 14 missions with about...

1304
01:38:50,394 --> 01:39:02,478
[SPEAKER_19]: 12 hours of gameplay, and of course, you know, the developer has a pretty good track record when it comes to multiplayer games, seeing as they were behind MAG, which had 256 players.

1305
01:39:03,198 --> 01:39:08,460
[SPEAKER_19]: However, the game will only have 32-player online multiplayer.

1306
01:39:10,201 --> 01:39:13,022
[SPEAKER_19]: And then, and this is great, apparently...

1307
01:39:14,085 --> 01:39:21,032
[SPEAKER_19]: At the 11th hour, Ubisoft has made some emergency changes to their DRM on their PC titles.

1308
01:39:22,573 --> 01:39:24,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Great topic for the fuck show.

1309
01:39:24,215 --> 01:39:33,164
[SPEAKER_19]: Apparently, there was some fixes that needed to be made because people were figuring out how to crack it.

1310
01:39:34,705 --> 01:39:35,366
[SPEAKER_19]: And of course...

1311
01:39:37,133 --> 01:39:51,698
[SPEAKER_19]: They've already cracked it, but Ubisoft says that players should... Should players lose their internet connection, a requirement under the company's ridiculous new DRM scheme, their single-player offline game would drop upon reloading.

1312
01:39:51,738 --> 01:39:56,619
[SPEAKER_19]: You'd be left with your last checkpoint and not the actual point you were cut out on.

1313
01:39:56,899 --> 01:40:02,281
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, their claim is that, no, the DRM has not been broken.

1314
01:40:02,401 --> 01:40:02,781
[SPEAKER_19]: In fact...

1315
01:40:03,061 --> 01:40:08,712
[SPEAKER_19]: Those who are playing the cracked version out there aren't getting the full game experience.

1316
01:40:09,333 --> 01:40:14,624
[SPEAKER_19]: In other words, they're not getting access to the Uplay stuff, which no one gives a shit.

1317
01:40:15,647 --> 01:40:31,511
[SPEAKER_19]: And to kind of go along with this, in kind of the worst case scenario situation, well, the worst case scenario situation happened, and apparently their servers went offline, their Ubisoft DRM authentication servers.

1318
01:40:31,891 --> 01:40:33,231
[SPEAKER_19]: They've been down, and guess what?

1319
01:40:33,871 --> 01:40:38,813
[SPEAKER_19]: Apparently people that had Assassin's Creed 2 can't play it right now.

1320
01:40:39,473 --> 01:40:40,013
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't!

1321
01:40:41,903 --> 01:41:09,831
[SPEAKER_19]: I smell a fucking class action lawsuit and apparently yes and it's been down for quite a long time and there's been people trying to log in for like 25 minutes and they're unable to do anything and a Noobisoft representative apparently responded to the forum thread that's over on the official Assassin's Creed 2 forum and saying clearly the extended downtime and lengthy login issues are unacceptable particularly as I've been told these servers are constantly monitored

1322
01:41:10,951 --> 01:41:13,454
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, they apparently watched them go down.

1323
01:41:13,474 --> 01:41:14,855
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, you fucked that up, didn't you?

1324
01:41:14,935 --> 01:41:15,856
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm honoring them!

1325
01:41:16,057 --> 01:41:16,737
[SPEAKER_19]: Crushing!

1326
01:41:18,159 --> 01:41:24,306
[SPEAKER_19]: And then they added, I'll do what I can to get more information on this issue.

1327
01:41:24,666 --> 01:41:28,230
[SPEAKER_19]: And here's more on what the issue is.

1328
01:41:28,270 --> 01:41:32,695
[SPEAKER_19]: First thing tomorrow, push for a resolution and assurance that this won't happen again in the future.

1329
01:41:34,196 --> 01:41:34,897
[SPEAKER_19]: It doesn't matter.

1330
01:41:35,417 --> 01:41:36,518
[SPEAKER_19]: They've already cracked it.

1331
01:41:37,218 --> 01:41:37,959
[SPEAKER_19]: Forget about it.

1332
01:41:38,179 --> 01:41:44,304
[SPEAKER_19]: Because what apparently happened is there was a cracker group out there that figured out that, hey, guess what?

1333
01:41:44,404 --> 01:41:56,975
[SPEAKER_19]: They have some sort of failsafe in the case that Ubisoft decides to go out of business that they'll put out a patch that will apparently disable this DRM so that you can play your game just fine.

1334
01:41:57,275 --> 01:41:57,755
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, guess what?

1335
01:41:57,795 --> 01:42:00,277
[SPEAKER_19]: The code's in there, and they've activated it, so...

1336
01:42:02,039 --> 01:42:02,780
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks, Ubisoft.

1337
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:03,360
[SPEAKER_19]: You made it easy.

1338
01:42:08,045 --> 01:42:09,607
[SPEAKER_19]: We all knew this was going to fucking happen.

1339
01:42:10,227 --> 01:42:10,468
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh-huh.

1340
01:42:11,148 --> 01:42:12,550
[SPEAKER_19]: And we all knew it's a stupid idea.

1341
01:42:12,730 --> 01:42:13,350
[SPEAKER_19]: And guess what?

1342
01:42:13,811 --> 01:42:14,692
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a stupid idea.

1343
01:42:16,471 --> 01:42:17,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it a fucking stupid idea?

1344
01:42:17,712 --> 01:42:18,913
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a fucking stupid idea.

1345
01:42:19,494 --> 01:42:23,797
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the worst idea ever because all you're doing is punishing the people that legitimately paid for the program.

1346
01:42:24,098 --> 01:42:27,580
[SPEAKER_19]: The people that want to hack it, they're going to wait for a hacked version to come out.

1347
01:42:28,121 --> 01:42:33,325
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think there's a PC title out there that they haven't figured out a way around some sort of DRM for it.

1348
01:42:34,646 --> 01:42:35,027
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh well.

1349
01:42:36,488 --> 01:42:37,109
[SPEAKER_19]: You tried.

1350
01:42:37,329 --> 01:42:37,909
[SPEAKER_19]: You failed.

1351
01:42:38,089 --> 01:42:40,752
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe you shouldn't try because it costs money to try.

1352
01:42:42,290 --> 01:42:47,333
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so a lot of fucking confusion going on over a highly fucking controversial game, Six Days in Fallujah.

1353
01:42:47,353 --> 01:42:49,955
[SPEAKER_04]: You might remember this game was supposed to fucking come out, and then it doesn't.

1354
01:42:49,995 --> 01:42:51,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, wasn't fucking Konami actually supposed to put it out?

1355
01:42:52,037 --> 01:42:52,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Konami was putting it out.

1356
01:42:52,937 --> 01:42:55,239
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they were like, no, we don't want to fucking be associated with this.

1357
01:42:55,259 --> 01:42:59,201
[SPEAKER_19]: Because they're working with terrorists or something, and they were also working with the soldiers that were there.

1358
01:42:59,221 --> 01:43:01,203
[SPEAKER_04]: But that wasn't going to fucking stop Atomic Games.

1359
01:43:01,243 --> 01:43:04,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently IGN reported this week that...

1360
01:43:04,805 --> 01:43:05,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1361
01:43:34,462 --> 01:43:38,310
[SPEAKER_04]: So keep an eye on Atomic Games, I suppose, if you really want more information on this game.

1362
01:43:38,351 --> 01:43:38,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I don't know.

1363
01:43:40,476 --> 01:43:44,024
[SPEAKER_04]: You know that old saying, strike when the iron is hot?

1364
01:43:45,666 --> 01:43:49,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, it's like, you know, the air is frozen, put away.

1365
01:43:51,588 --> 01:44:00,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, on some other fucking news, if you still are one of these people that don't have a fucking Wii for some reason, Walmart can sell you the bundle that everybody fucking thought would be out already.

1366
01:44:00,731 --> 01:44:08,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Walmart is selling a Wii, a Nintendo Wii, Wii Sports, Wii Sports Resort, and the Motion Plus attachment.

1367
01:44:08,634 --> 01:44:09,875
[SPEAKER_04]: It's available right now.

1368
01:44:09,895 --> 01:44:11,175
[SPEAKER_04]: $199 is the price for this.

1369
01:44:14,873 --> 01:44:18,735
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically it's a normal Wii thing with Wii Sports Resort with it.

1370
01:44:18,775 --> 01:44:25,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, you know, although Walmart, I don't know, they can kind of be fucking shady about some things like, I don't know, censorship on albums.

1371
01:44:26,579 --> 01:44:28,360
[SPEAKER_04]: A good deal is still a good deal.

1372
01:44:28,460 --> 01:44:31,342
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you do not have a Nintendo Wii for whatever reason, you want the whole thing.

1373
01:44:31,362 --> 01:44:34,523
[SPEAKER_19]: It'll be in limited supplies as if the supplies aren't limited enough already.

1374
01:44:34,723 --> 01:44:34,963
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

1375
01:44:35,464 --> 01:44:35,584
[SPEAKER_19]: So.

1376
01:44:36,644 --> 01:45:03,998
[SPEAKER_04]: and one other fucking thing I have for you guys before I turn it over to DarkSakura Tecmo Bowl there is a new Tecmo Bowl coming it's a new old Tecmo Bowl it's a fucking throwback I am actually fucking excited about this I don't talk a lot about sports games on this show because I don't fucking play a lot of them because I know it's going to sound weird but a lot of them are too fucking complicated for me because I don't watch a lot of them on TV but I like the kind of overly simplified ones like NBA Jam I always love that game in the fucking arcades and

1377
01:45:04,278 --> 01:45:15,083
[SPEAKER_04]: And this new one is somewhat interesting I fucking love Tecmo Bowl on the NES I thought it was great So the idea that they're kind of doing this throwback I find very fucking exciting Will it feature real sugar this time?

1378
01:45:15,343 --> 01:45:32,170
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know The idea of this was kind of leaked a little while ago Thanks to an ESRB rating But now it's been acknowledged Tecmo Bowl throwback is coming out on the Xbox Live Arcade And PlayStation Network sometime in the spring It's a remake of Tecmo Super Bowl You can switch to classic 2D Amongst I guess the 3D

1379
01:45:33,591 --> 01:45:36,414
[SPEAKER_04]: The people who fucking made it are South End Interactive.

1380
01:45:36,454 --> 01:45:39,277
[SPEAKER_04]: They also made that fucking Lode Runner game and R-Type.

1381
01:45:40,238 --> 01:45:41,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Did Lode Runner ever fucking come out?

1382
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:43,361
[SPEAKER_04]: On the Xbox 360?

1383
01:45:43,481 --> 01:45:44,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, some time ago.

1384
01:45:44,462 --> 01:45:46,244
[SPEAKER_04]: The R-Type one's pretty fucking rad.

1385
01:45:46,284 --> 01:45:49,748
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's the R-Type that's on Xbox Live RTA, that's pretty fucking rad.

1386
01:45:50,088 --> 01:45:51,870
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a good studio to be doing this.

1387
01:45:52,291 --> 01:45:53,352
[SPEAKER_04]: All new 3D graphics.

1388
01:45:53,992 --> 01:45:56,853
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and, and, online play.

1389
01:45:57,753 --> 01:45:58,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck yeah.

1390
01:45:58,413 --> 01:46:04,295
[SPEAKER_04]: TechMobile Throwback will have 32 teams, online leaderboards, and customizable options for the teams and the rosters.

1391
01:46:04,735 --> 01:46:07,696
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, like, are they going to be actual teams or no?

1392
01:46:07,716 --> 01:46:08,797
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be fake teams.

1393
01:46:09,057 --> 01:46:09,737
[SPEAKER_04]: They're fake teams.

1394
01:46:10,317 --> 01:46:14,898
[SPEAKER_04]: They're called New York and Denver, but it's not like fucking the New York and the Denver.

1395
01:46:15,258 --> 01:46:16,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Still, I'm all over it.

1396
01:46:16,799 --> 01:46:20,200
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet you never thought you would hear me say this about a sports game here on OLR.

1397
01:46:20,680 --> 01:46:22,241
[SPEAKER_04]: I am all fucking about this game.

1398
01:46:22,502 --> 01:46:25,264
[SPEAKER_04]: I am very excited to fucking play this game.

1399
01:46:25,764 --> 01:46:28,887
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura's got a few stories for us and then some Twitter topics.

1400
01:46:29,047 --> 01:46:30,168
[SPEAKER_07]: I sure fucking do.

1401
01:46:31,749 --> 01:46:34,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Rock Band, we are getting some songs.

1402
01:46:34,711 --> 01:46:39,335
[SPEAKER_07]: White Stripes Pack, which will be $4.40, $5.50.

1403
01:46:39,435 --> 01:46:45,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Fell in Love with the Girls, Seven Nation Army, and You Don't Know What Love Is, You Just Do As You're Told.

1404
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:49,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Individual Tracks, The Future Heads, Decent Days and Nights, Hounds of Love.

1405
01:46:50,364 --> 01:46:52,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, wasn't that a Kate Bush song?

1406
01:46:53,529 --> 01:46:59,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, anyway, The James Gang, Walk Away, Neil Peart, The Hockey Theme, and Seamus, All of This, and Tie You Down.

1407
01:47:01,281 --> 01:47:03,284
[SPEAKER_07]: And other news, there is a, uh,

1408
01:47:05,260 --> 01:47:06,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1409
01:47:07,542 --> 01:47:10,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Something that was given to me as an incomplete link that I have no idea what it is.

1410
01:47:11,906 --> 01:47:14,469
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Max Technica 2 has a teaser out.

1411
01:47:16,010 --> 01:47:17,812
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess people can go watch it.

1412
01:47:18,492 --> 01:47:23,537
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the 8-bit Left 4 Dead dude is doing Mega Man 9 HD remix.

1413
01:47:24,678 --> 01:47:26,620
[SPEAKER_07]: So keep your eyes open for that.

1414
01:47:27,441 --> 01:47:32,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I bet nobody's going to ever fucking play it because there'll be a lawsuit that'll stop it if they ever try to put that out.

1415
01:47:32,563 --> 01:47:34,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's just the fucking way the world works.

1416
01:47:34,464 --> 01:47:34,784
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll try.

1417
01:47:34,804 --> 01:47:35,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, it's not Activision.

1418
01:47:36,025 --> 01:47:36,845
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Capcom.

1419
01:47:36,945 --> 01:47:37,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

1420
01:47:37,305 --> 01:47:38,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they'll be a little cooler.

1421
01:47:39,008 --> 01:47:39,288
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1422
01:48:07,958 --> 01:48:08,258
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1423
01:48:08,278 --> 01:48:08,759
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?

1424
01:48:08,839 --> 01:48:11,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, is Mega Man 10 too much or what?

1425
01:48:12,722 --> 01:48:13,623
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think it's too much.

1426
01:48:14,103 --> 01:48:19,788
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it would be pretty cool to see them release more of these retro games.

1427
01:48:21,029 --> 01:48:22,811
[SPEAKER_19]: The problem is they're just not as good as Mega Man 2.

1428
01:48:25,154 --> 01:48:25,954
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1429
01:48:44,821 --> 01:48:47,725
[SPEAKER_19]: and hell, I'd like to see a studio that only did that.

1430
01:48:47,765 --> 01:48:48,646
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be pretty awesome.

1431
01:48:48,786 --> 01:48:55,554
[SPEAKER_04]: I think DarkTouch Studio raises a fucking good point in chat saying, well, I don't think Capcom would want people playing the equivalent of one of their recent releases for free.

1432
01:48:56,275 --> 01:48:57,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can see that.

1433
01:48:57,496 --> 01:48:59,458
[SPEAKER_04]: They're still probably making some fucking money off Mega Man 9.

1434
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:03,944
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, they would shut this shit down if it was getting out there too much.

1435
01:49:04,335 --> 01:49:33,250
[SPEAKER_19]: but I don't think it's a bad thing you know why not you know now that they kind of did the fucking retro 3 and just go in and make some HD sprites keep the same game keep the same just make it pretty or even you know what you could do and here's what they really need to do they need to put fucking Mega Man 9 and Mega Man 10 like on the DS or something like that so I can take it with me and play that shit well I mean those ROMs gotta be pretty small anyways that aside or a new Mega Man collection would be kind of cool with those in there

1436
01:49:35,669 --> 01:49:38,772
[SPEAKER_19]: If they want to make a 3D game, make another Mega Man Legends.

1437
01:49:39,333 --> 01:49:40,534
[SPEAKER_19]: That would be fucking awesome.

1438
01:49:42,192 --> 01:49:44,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's get to some Twitter topics.

1439
01:49:45,995 --> 01:49:47,736
[SPEAKER_04]: See what you fucking people on Twitter have to say.

1440
01:49:49,318 --> 01:49:50,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week we read your tweets.

1441
01:49:50,959 --> 01:49:53,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Show us your tweets at OLR.

1442
01:49:53,320 --> 01:50:03,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of fucking celebration that finally, a year and a half after I think the idea was first announced, we are finally having our fucking fuck show up against the Oscars tonight in a moment of protest.

1443
01:50:03,108 --> 01:50:05,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Not everybody fucking on board with the fuck show though.

1444
01:50:05,810 --> 01:50:06,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Sterlok sends us a tweet.

1445
01:50:07,411 --> 01:50:10,173
[SPEAKER_04]: To be perfectly honest, this joke is already painfully old.

1446
01:50:11,462 --> 01:50:12,483
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not gonna be for everybody.

1447
01:50:13,804 --> 01:50:17,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep in mind, we're not just doing it to say fuck a lot.

1448
01:50:17,946 --> 01:50:19,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, although I will say that's a nice benefit.

1449
01:50:20,048 --> 01:50:25,771
[SPEAKER_04]: But it is a protest against people taking their time out of their busy schedules.

1450
01:50:25,811 --> 01:50:29,294
[SPEAKER_04]: They should be balancing budgets to tell us that we shouldn't swear.

1451
01:50:29,354 --> 01:50:31,575
[SPEAKER_04]: That swearing makes us somehow unintelligent.

1452
01:50:32,196 --> 01:50:34,157
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same fucking show tonight, just more fuck.

1453
01:50:35,118 --> 01:50:37,679
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I don't know, I was a little worried coming into it.

1454
01:50:37,719 --> 01:50:39,981
[SPEAKER_04]: It might get fucking old after three hours, but we'll see.

1455
01:50:40,581 --> 01:50:42,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Two hours and I still feel pretty fucking good.

1456
01:50:42,503 --> 01:50:43,884
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, you doing okay?

1457
01:50:44,744 --> 01:50:44,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

1458
01:50:45,205 --> 01:50:45,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck yeah.

1459
01:50:45,925 --> 01:50:46,165
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1460
01:50:47,206 --> 01:50:47,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1461
01:50:48,027 --> 01:50:53,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Spazinator says some very nasty words to Sony.

1462
01:50:54,451 --> 01:50:56,293
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet he'll call in later and say some more about that.

1463
01:50:56,633 --> 01:51:10,836
[SPEAKER_04]: But also says, let's see if I got this right This is in response to the heavy rain thing SpazinatorPSN says, let's see if I got this right Heads blown off, fine Hot crowbar up the ass, fine Mass murder, fine Tits are vag What sicko wants to see that fucking shit?

1464
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:19,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, it's like the biggest, like, I don't even know what word you would say to describe this.

1465
01:51:20,329 --> 01:51:31,120
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just this big, glaring hypocrisy in the media and in society that has been going on for a very long time.

1466
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:32,141
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just fucking...

1467
01:51:33,562 --> 01:51:35,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Video games, but it's movies, too.

1468
01:51:36,243 --> 01:51:36,903
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that movie?

1469
01:51:36,923 --> 01:51:42,484
[SPEAKER_04]: There was some movie about, like, it's called This Movie is Rated R or something like that that explores, like, the NC-17 rating.

1470
01:51:43,044 --> 01:51:45,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking fascinating.

1471
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:50,205
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTouch Studio wants everyone to fucking know that I Love This Song resumes this week on the site.

1472
01:51:50,245 --> 01:51:50,685
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

1473
01:51:50,725 --> 01:51:53,086
[SPEAKER_04]: I like seeing some more fucking content on OLR.

1474
01:51:53,126 --> 01:51:59,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully there's more than just the I Love That Song segment, which was, you know, everything that was on the website, but I do...

1475
01:51:59,867 --> 01:52:00,527
[SPEAKER_04]: I like music.

1476
01:52:00,667 --> 01:52:01,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Gaming music is good.

1477
01:52:02,268 --> 01:52:05,389
[SPEAKER_04]: I always like the I Love That Song segment and the diversity of stuff that they picked.

1478
01:52:05,929 --> 01:52:06,470
[SPEAKER_04]: So fuck yeah.

1479
01:52:07,350 --> 01:52:12,552
[SPEAKER_04]: And lastly, Takeo Ray sends his tweet, wants to know, so does anyone have an F-bomb count for the show?

1480
01:52:13,352 --> 01:52:17,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they lost track in the first fucking five minutes.

1481
01:52:17,794 --> 01:52:18,955
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1482
01:52:34,789 --> 01:52:39,491
[SPEAKER_19]: And, I mean, I doubt that Guinness will pay attention to something like this because it's just a fucking podcast.

1483
01:52:40,031 --> 01:52:43,432
[SPEAKER_19]: But, hey, they'll pay attention to, like, what the longest pretzel is or some shit like that.

1484
01:52:44,133 --> 01:52:44,933
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't fucking get them.

1485
01:52:45,553 --> 01:52:48,334
[SPEAKER_19]: Some of the shit that they fucking record is ridiculous.

1486
01:52:48,394 --> 01:52:51,555
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, maybe we can be in the gaming podcast.

1487
01:52:51,635 --> 01:52:54,676
[SPEAKER_19]: Or, not the gaming podcast, the gaming Guinness Book of World Records thing.

1488
01:52:55,317 --> 01:52:59,038
[SPEAKER_07]: I was gonna say, maybe we could record her taking a shit.

1489
01:53:00,808 --> 01:53:02,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I haven't started talking about the tester yet.

1490
01:53:02,890 --> 01:53:04,491
[SPEAKER_04]: I did watch episode two of the tester.

1491
01:53:05,252 --> 01:53:06,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it worth a shirmy poop?

1492
01:53:07,994 --> 01:53:10,956
[SPEAKER_04]: I still feel the same about it.

1493
01:53:11,076 --> 01:53:18,722
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the most terrible thing to ever reach my television, but it's no RuPaul's Drag Race, which would be the best thing to ever grace my television.

1494
01:53:19,503 --> 01:53:21,745
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a big what the fuck ever.

1495
01:53:22,866 --> 01:53:25,568
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets a three out of five RuPaul's Drag Races.

1496
01:53:27,166 --> 01:53:45,295
[SPEAKER_04]: um it should have to lip sync for its life I do think that is something I don't know it's pretty obvious that they fucking film this whole show in the scope of like three or four days like like they're doing a little challenge in the morning kick somebody off to a challenge in the evening kick somebody off to it was really fucking fast I'm sure whatever

1497
01:53:47,406 --> 01:53:51,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Just as quick as their career.

1498
01:53:51,268 --> 01:53:51,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, $5,000.

1499
01:53:51,548 --> 01:53:56,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, if it's just like four days or whatever to film the show, I'd fucking go on the tester, win the $5,000, and then quit.

1500
01:53:56,550 --> 01:53:56,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you.

1501
01:54:01,932 --> 01:54:03,453
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1502
01:54:29,457 --> 01:54:30,598
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1503
01:54:48,288 --> 01:54:48,968
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn it!

1504
01:54:50,449 --> 01:54:56,431
[SPEAKER_04]: BoFuckYouIchikawa in our chatroom, chat.orangelaunchradio.com, said episode four of The Tester is supposed to be LARPing.

1505
01:54:56,951 --> 01:54:57,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

1506
01:54:57,832 --> 01:54:58,592
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be awesome.

1507
01:54:58,872 --> 01:54:59,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well.

1508
01:54:59,472 --> 01:55:01,033
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm only through the second episode.

1509
01:55:01,113 --> 01:55:02,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I just watched the first two.

1510
01:55:02,214 --> 01:55:04,114
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm glad they didn't waste time on those stereotypes.

1511
01:55:04,134 --> 01:55:07,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you see the people who were doing the live-action Avatar roleplay?

1512
01:55:08,476 --> 01:55:08,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh god.

1513
01:55:08,836 --> 01:55:09,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh god.

1514
01:55:34,241 --> 01:55:36,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's move on with some more fucking gaming news.

1515
01:55:36,562 --> 01:55:40,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the mailbag, then your fucking calls, which I'm sure are going to be a hoot and a holler tonight.

1516
01:55:40,883 --> 01:55:41,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't fucking wait for that.

1517
01:55:42,104 --> 01:55:43,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, every call counts.

1518
01:55:43,944 --> 01:55:44,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1519
01:55:45,104 --> 01:55:47,625
[SPEAKER_04]: We might have to institute the time limit on calls tonight.

1520
01:55:47,805 --> 01:55:48,686
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're going to do that.

1521
01:55:48,726 --> 01:55:50,486
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're going to do rapid fire calls tonight.

1522
01:55:51,006 --> 01:55:52,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so everybody can have their say.

1523
01:55:52,667 --> 01:55:55,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know everybody wants to get rapid fire calls tonight.

1524
01:55:55,168 --> 01:55:55,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone gives a fuck.

1525
01:55:56,529 --> 01:55:57,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Rapid Fire calls tonight.

1526
01:55:57,792 --> 01:55:58,774
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm already throwing that down.

1527
01:55:58,794 --> 01:55:59,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Your call is too long.

1528
01:55:59,295 --> 01:56:00,318
[SPEAKER_04]: We hang up on you now.

1529
01:56:00,338 --> 01:56:00,739
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, though?

1530
01:56:00,799 --> 01:56:04,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of getting three calls, we could get through like seven if we do a time limit.

1531
01:56:04,649 --> 01:56:05,811
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to do that tonight.

1532
01:56:06,178 --> 01:56:10,120
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Loki, some fucking gaming news for us.

1533
01:56:10,521 --> 01:56:13,602
[SPEAKER_19]: This also has nothing to fucking do with the PlayStation Network.

1534
01:56:14,143 --> 01:56:18,585
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, the PlayStation Network technically didn't go down, but PlayStation 3 did.

1535
01:56:19,646 --> 01:56:34,894
[SPEAKER_19]: Way back in late 2008, apparently a Pennsylvania teenager playing SOCOM US Navy SEALs got kicked out of a tournament for using a cheat mod, so he decided to take revenge by crashing the PlayStation website for 11 days.

1536
01:56:36,675 --> 01:56:39,716
[SPEAKER_19]: and what's funny though is Sony has decided, you know what?

1537
01:56:40,957 --> 01:56:49,380
[SPEAKER_19]: They filed a federal grand jury investigation which led to the perpetrator getting arrested.

1538
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:56,863
[SPEAKER_19]: The hacker pled guilty to four felony charges in juvie court and apparently he got access to

1539
01:56:57,583 --> 01:57:03,025
[SPEAKER_19]: He apparently got access to the site's servers and let loose a virus that brought everything down.

1540
01:57:03,565 --> 01:57:14,288
[SPEAKER_19]: And his methods, I guess, weren't described, but some experts or whatever contacted by local TV stations said they weren't so sophisticated that someone else couldn't pull it off.

1541
01:57:14,929 --> 01:57:18,530
[SPEAKER_19]: Hopefully, by now, they've already fixed that stuff.

1542
01:57:20,150 --> 01:57:39,236
[SPEAKER_19]: Apparently also it says, in exchange, the team pleaded guilty to four counts and lawful use of a computer, criminal use of a computer, computer trespassing and distribution of a computer virus in exchange for prosecutors dropping the 11 others, some related to the March 2009 cyber attack.

1543
01:57:41,137 --> 01:57:41,577
[SPEAKER_19]: That's funny.

1544
01:57:43,217 --> 01:57:44,017
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what's even funnier?

1545
01:57:44,337 --> 01:57:45,698
[SPEAKER_19]: Is he's from La Trobe.

1546
01:57:47,088 --> 01:57:51,192
[SPEAKER_19]: We have a road over here named Latrobe, but this is all in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

1547
01:57:51,332 --> 01:57:52,773
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually know where that is in Pennsylvania.

1548
01:57:52,854 --> 01:57:54,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just Pittsburgh, but what they're talking about.

1549
01:57:54,795 --> 01:57:56,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, boo fucking who for this kid.

1550
01:57:56,817 --> 01:57:58,379
[SPEAKER_04]: He got what he deserved, honestly.

1551
01:57:58,399 --> 01:58:00,321
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't fucking hack the website.

1552
01:58:00,421 --> 01:58:02,182
[SPEAKER_04]: You got kicked out for fucking cheating.

1553
01:58:02,202 --> 01:58:03,484
[SPEAKER_04]: You fucking deserved it.

1554
01:58:03,904 --> 01:58:05,205
[SPEAKER_19]: He thought he was leap hack source.

1555
01:58:05,225 --> 01:58:06,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Boo hoo.

1556
01:58:06,627 --> 01:58:08,328
[SPEAKER_04]: I got banned for cheating.

1557
01:58:08,869 --> 01:58:09,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Wah.

1558
01:58:10,790 --> 01:58:12,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Have fun in the fucking slammer.

1559
01:58:15,032 --> 01:58:21,140
[SPEAKER_04]: On to happier news, a really fucking cute fucking game on the PlayStation 3, LittleBigPlanet.

1560
01:58:21,500 --> 01:58:22,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Who doesn't love LittleBigPlanet?

1561
01:58:22,882 --> 01:58:23,964
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so fucking adorable.

1562
01:58:24,885 --> 01:58:31,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of people do, apparently enough to make 2 million, 2 million user-created levels.

1563
01:58:31,333 --> 01:58:32,935
[SPEAKER_19]: There is some pretty fun stuff on there.

1564
01:58:33,295 --> 01:58:34,016
[SPEAKER_19]: and DarkSakura.

1565
01:58:50,274 --> 01:59:06,261
[SPEAKER_04]: and uh this shouldn't really come as a big fucking surprise but Media Molecule has now been absorbed fully as a first party company for Sony so Sony has now sucked them up into their collective and Media Molecule now has their fucking checks signed by Sony so there it is

1566
01:59:06,941 --> 01:59:07,702
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Dan!

1567
01:59:07,842 --> 01:59:10,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Media Molecule is no longer an independent studio.

1568
01:59:11,804 --> 01:59:21,110
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the way, a comment from Michael Denny, the Senior Vice President of Sony Worldwide Studios, quote, Media Molecule will simply continue to make great games.

1569
01:59:21,571 --> 01:59:27,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcoming Media Molecule into the PlayStation family will allow us to better support their future titles and ambitions.

1570
01:59:27,695 --> 01:59:28,895
[SPEAKER_04]: They're really fucked now.

1571
01:59:29,276 --> 01:59:31,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding, I added that last part myself.

1572
01:59:33,081 --> 01:59:33,401
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1573
01:59:34,463 --> 01:59:37,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan yelled from the living room, that's only if Activision buys them.

1574
01:59:37,406 --> 01:59:41,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Boy, if Activision comes for your company, run, bitch, run.

1575
01:59:42,131 --> 01:59:43,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Just say nay.

1576
01:59:43,273 --> 01:59:44,854
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait for them to close Blizzard.

1577
01:59:46,116 --> 01:59:46,977
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be the day.

1578
01:59:48,138 --> 01:59:49,479
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what you got for us?

1579
01:59:50,507 --> 01:59:59,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there was a version of a number of different Nintendo games, some of them super rare, that were going on eBay.

1580
02:00:01,670 --> 02:00:05,230
[SPEAKER_07]: There was one in particular, Family Fun Fitness Stadium Events.

1581
02:00:05,890 --> 02:00:08,351
[SPEAKER_07]: It hit a bid amount of $800,200.

1582
02:00:14,201 --> 02:00:16,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking eBay scammers.

1583
02:00:16,922 --> 02:00:20,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Like anybody who has that much money to blow on an NES game.

1584
02:00:20,463 --> 02:00:27,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is actually the highest game on there right now is Bubble Bath Babes with the box for $2,995.

1585
02:00:28,044 --> 02:00:31,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Worth every fucking penny.

1586
02:00:32,126 --> 02:00:34,746
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll offer a one cent bid on it.

1587
02:00:36,527 --> 02:00:40,268
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think you can put a one cent bid when you have to have a minimum bid of $3,000.

1588
02:00:40,688 --> 02:00:41,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Best offer, five bucks.

1589
02:00:42,711 --> 02:00:46,354
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, this is totally off topic here, just thought I'd mention this because this is funny.

1590
02:00:46,374 --> 02:00:47,515
[SPEAKER_19]: Not fucking allowed.

1591
02:00:47,635 --> 02:00:54,760
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, well this is going back to the fucking story we had about, um, during Rapid Fire, about the Ubisoft DRM.

1592
02:00:55,480 --> 02:00:56,862
[SPEAKER_19]: Here's why their server went down.

1593
02:00:57,142 --> 02:01:01,985
[SPEAKER_19]: Due to exceptional demand, we are currently experiencing difficulties.

1594
02:01:02,326 --> 02:01:05,328
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, that's right, because their games sold and people bought them,

1595
02:01:05,848 --> 02:01:12,217
[SPEAKER_19]: and then try to play them and it logs in online, it causes server strain and therefore it's not going to work.

1596
02:01:12,237 --> 02:01:15,221
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically, if you buy their games, it breaks the server.

1597
02:01:16,002 --> 02:01:18,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't they just fucking say it's a DDoS attack?

1598
02:01:18,185 --> 02:01:20,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's clearly what's going on, right?

1599
02:01:20,248 --> 02:01:20,649
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not.

1600
02:01:21,009 --> 02:01:22,552
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just from people playing their games.

1601
02:01:24,229 --> 02:01:26,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you think that's just a load of bullshit?

1602
02:01:26,431 --> 02:01:27,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to fucking save face?

1603
02:01:28,574 --> 02:01:29,394
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just stupid.

1604
02:01:29,895 --> 02:01:32,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Exceptional demand could be a bunch of inquiries to their server.

1605
02:01:33,058 --> 02:01:34,400
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're being DDoS'd.

1606
02:01:35,601 --> 02:01:36,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Which isn't okay.

1607
02:01:36,842 --> 02:01:38,144
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's fucked up.

1608
02:01:38,204 --> 02:01:38,744
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't support that.

1609
02:01:38,764 --> 02:01:40,546
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's even worse if that's the case.

1610
02:01:41,047 --> 02:01:42,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, dude, the exceptional demand.

1611
02:01:42,789 --> 02:01:44,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that will be a problem going forward.

1612
02:01:44,951 --> 02:01:46,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I would... You don't...

1613
02:01:47,293 --> 02:01:50,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking take all these statements at face value, though.

1614
02:01:50,235 --> 02:01:52,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Because look at what Sony said earlier this week.

1615
02:01:52,456 --> 02:01:54,017
[SPEAKER_04]: We fixed the fucking date problem.

1616
02:01:54,077 --> 02:01:54,697
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you didn't.

1617
02:01:54,758 --> 02:01:55,698
[SPEAKER_04]: You waited it out.

1618
02:01:55,798 --> 02:01:56,939
[SPEAKER_04]: You fucking waited it out.

1619
02:01:57,039 --> 02:02:02,242
[SPEAKER_04]: And then put out a press release about how fucking awesome you are to fix the problem in exactly 24 hours.

1620
02:02:03,383 --> 02:02:03,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

1621
02:02:04,303 --> 02:02:05,444
[SPEAKER_04]: We weren't born yesterday.

1622
02:02:06,244 --> 02:02:07,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Due to exceptional demand.

1623
02:02:11,647 --> 02:02:12,228
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1624
02:02:12,308 --> 02:02:12,548
[SPEAKER_04]: You're...

1625
02:02:14,989 --> 02:02:20,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Your fucking DRM is about as in demand as a fucking Yanni CD at Lollapalooza, okay?

1626
02:02:21,177 --> 02:02:23,339
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how fucking in demand your thing is.

1627
02:02:25,562 --> 02:02:25,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

1628
02:02:27,085 --> 02:02:28,166
[SPEAKER_04]: More news than the mailbag.

1629
02:02:56,349 --> 02:03:01,555
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, they launched with 105 songs, which is fucking awesome.

1630
02:03:02,016 --> 02:03:03,077
[SPEAKER_19]: Try that, Guitar Hero.

1631
02:03:04,299 --> 02:03:04,639
[SPEAKER_19]: Seriously.

1632
02:03:04,899 --> 02:03:05,600
[SPEAKER_19]: Or DJ Hero.

1633
02:03:06,842 --> 02:03:08,584
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't even get me started with DJ Hero.

1634
02:03:08,684 --> 02:03:10,446
[SPEAKER_19]: Two download packs.

1635
02:03:10,506 --> 02:03:11,647
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I should have figured...

1636
02:03:12,408 --> 02:03:22,015
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, no, but seriously, compare this to what they have for, you know, Guitar Hero, where they have their basic service that you can, you know, create your own tracks and throw them on there for, uh, free download.

1637
02:03:22,075 --> 02:03:24,797
[SPEAKER_19]: But this is, like, way better.

1638
02:03:25,137 --> 02:03:26,258
[SPEAKER_19]: And 105 tracks launched.

1639
02:03:26,278 --> 02:03:33,262
[SPEAKER_19]: So far, the song ranges from, uh, price ranges are about 80 to 160 Microsoft points, or a buck or two.

1640
02:03:33,943 --> 02:03:36,164
[SPEAKER_19]: And, um, you know, just kind of some of the, um...

1641
02:03:37,125 --> 02:03:37,926
[SPEAKER_19]: MC Frontalot I love that song

1642
02:04:01,625 --> 02:04:07,448
[SPEAKER_19]: Also a little bit of Jonathan Colton in there, including Creepy Doll, Ikea in the Future Soon.

1643
02:04:09,549 --> 02:04:10,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Another two bunch of good songs.

1644
02:04:12,450 --> 02:04:16,372
[SPEAKER_19]: And then a bunch of other artists I don't recognize, but a lot of other people might.

1645
02:04:17,433 --> 02:04:18,313
[SPEAKER_19]: Was it The Shins?

1646
02:04:18,974 --> 02:04:20,654
[SPEAKER_19]: Australia, I recognize The Shins.

1647
02:04:22,235 --> 02:04:24,056
[SPEAKER_19]: There's some other artists, The Main Drag.

1648
02:04:25,737 --> 02:04:27,478
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see here, Scratching the Itch.

1649
02:04:29,625 --> 02:04:29,905
[SPEAKER_19]: Whatever.

1650
02:04:30,165 --> 02:04:31,166
[SPEAKER_19]: But tons of stuff.

1651
02:04:31,266 --> 02:04:35,850
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's going to be more added each day as this goes on.

1652
02:04:36,130 --> 02:04:37,851
[SPEAKER_19]: So definitely worth checking out.

1653
02:04:38,171 --> 02:04:47,238
[SPEAKER_19]: They are exclusive on the Xbox 360 for 30 days, after which a selection of standout tracks will become available on the PlayStation 3 and the Wii.

1654
02:04:50,191 --> 02:05:02,434
[SPEAKER_04]: OLR should have a fucking song on there like I don't know we don't really have any we don't do music really but I think we should just we should have a fucking song on the Rock Band Network somehow the problem it's it's not an original song

1655
02:05:03,171 --> 02:05:03,651
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1656
02:05:27,169 --> 02:05:50,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, if someone wants to put all that effort and work into it, yeah sure I got one more story for you guys and then we can get to the fucking mailbag This has to do with an update to the Code of Conduct I gotta be honest, although I'm sure this probably pissed me off when I first fucking heard about it I totally fucking forgot about it until this story came out this week That apparently, Xbox Live has now lifted the ban on using the terms Lesbian, Gay, Bi, Transgender, and Straight in your profiles

1657
02:05:51,090 --> 02:05:56,873
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to put, hi, I like games and I'm a big lesbian in your profile, it is okay to do that now.

1658
02:05:56,953 --> 02:05:57,774
[SPEAKER_04]: So have a ball.

1659
02:05:58,814 --> 02:06:01,656
[SPEAKER_04]: And I talked a little bit about this on Bobby Blackwolf's show tonight.

1660
02:06:02,116 --> 02:06:04,037
[SPEAKER_04]: He's the show before us in all games radio.

1661
02:06:04,057 --> 02:06:05,758
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a much cleaner show than we are, by the way.

1662
02:06:06,158 --> 02:06:07,919
[SPEAKER_04]: He's always kind enough to do a call with us.

1663
02:06:08,679 --> 02:06:12,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you imagine how fucking bleeped out he is?

1664
02:06:12,401 --> 02:06:14,162
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see Bobby do a fuck show, man.

1665
02:06:14,222 --> 02:06:16,003
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see him just go off one night.

1666
02:06:16,363 --> 02:06:19,664
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't fucking believe this fucking... I love it.

1667
02:06:19,684 --> 02:06:19,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1668
02:06:19,924 --> 02:06:20,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway...

1669
02:06:39,509 --> 02:06:50,814
[SPEAKER_04]: On Bobby's show, I was talking about this a little bit, and I was just saying, like, you know, okay, yeah, I'm a gay guy, and I don't think I really care that I can put this in my profile now, especially on Xbox Live, of all places.

1670
02:06:50,934 --> 02:06:55,856
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to put, like, I'm a gay gamer, 31, from California.

1671
02:06:55,896 --> 02:06:58,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's not fucking Match.com or whatever.

1672
02:06:59,137 --> 02:07:00,237
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Xbox Live.

1673
02:07:00,257 --> 02:07:01,438
[SPEAKER_07]: This is anybody's business.

1674
02:07:01,918 --> 02:07:04,499
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, why do people make that such a big deal?

1675
02:07:04,579 --> 02:07:08,761
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, yeah, it's a part of your identity, but it's not like I go around saying...

1676
02:07:09,341 --> 02:07:10,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, I like everybody.

1677
02:07:11,124 --> 02:07:15,710
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also agree that if someone wants to do it, they should have every right to.

1678
02:07:16,270 --> 02:07:16,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Agreed.

1679
02:07:16,991 --> 02:07:18,453
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't understand why you'd do it.

1680
02:07:18,573 --> 02:07:22,379
[SPEAKER_04]: But okay, if you want to put it on your profile, you should have every right without repercussion.

1681
02:07:24,041 --> 02:07:26,404
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're probably going to get all these messages from losers going...

1682
02:07:27,023 --> 02:07:27,243
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

1683
02:07:27,283 --> 02:07:28,063
[SPEAKER_16]: You're a fag?

1684
02:07:28,124 --> 02:07:31,745
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe I should put in my profile, send me boob photos, you know.

1685
02:07:34,246 --> 02:07:35,966
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be okay to put in your profile, I love lesbians.

1686
02:07:35,986 --> 02:07:36,727
[SPEAKER_04]: That's well on my rights.

1687
02:07:36,847 --> 02:07:38,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Big supporter of lesbian rights.

1688
02:07:38,347 --> 02:07:38,727
[SPEAKER_04]: You could do it.

1689
02:07:38,747 --> 02:07:40,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Big supporter of lesbian boobs.

1690
02:07:40,388 --> 02:07:41,068
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1691
02:07:41,328 --> 02:07:42,129
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be okay.

1692
02:07:43,189 --> 02:07:44,330
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there you go.

1693
02:07:44,430 --> 02:07:46,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Have fun with your profiles and so forth.

1694
02:07:47,351 --> 02:07:49,451
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, that's someone else I gotta follow on Twitter.

1695
02:07:49,852 --> 02:07:50,032
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1696
02:07:51,792 --> 02:07:55,954
[SPEAKER_19]: One of my friends on LiveJournal, they have Tom Selleck in an icon.

1697
02:07:55,994 --> 02:07:56,194
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm like,

1698
02:07:56,334 --> 02:07:59,537
[SPEAKER_19]: Link the Twitter in chat, we will double the number tonight Link the Twitter in chat, chatters

02:08:19,435 --> 02:08:21,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio loves Steve Guttenberg.

1700
02:08:21,457 --> 02:08:22,418
[SPEAKER_04]: You fucking know what to do.

1701
02:08:22,518 --> 02:08:23,779
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to follow this guy.

1702
02:08:24,079 --> 02:08:26,261
[SPEAKER_04]: President Cat approves of Steve Guttenberg.

1703
02:08:26,902 --> 02:08:28,243
[SPEAKER_04]: It's three men and a fucking baby.

1704
02:08:28,624 --> 02:08:29,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we know it's really him?

1705
02:08:30,325 --> 02:08:30,846
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

1706
02:08:30,906 --> 02:08:32,707
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the only Steve Guttenberg on Twitter.

1707
02:08:34,409 --> 02:08:35,410
[SPEAKER_04]: So it must be him.

1708
02:08:35,450 --> 02:08:36,070
[SPEAKER_04]: It must be.

1709
02:08:36,110 --> 02:08:38,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Who'd want to impersonate Steve Guttenberg?

1710
02:08:39,434 --> 02:08:39,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody.

1711
02:08:41,257 --> 02:08:42,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's see who's following him.

1712
02:08:43,838 --> 02:08:44,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1713
02:08:45,179 --> 02:08:45,839
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on there.

1714
02:08:46,580 --> 02:08:48,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Not many actual famous people.

1715
02:08:49,001 --> 02:08:49,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Look it up on Twitter.

1716
02:08:49,842 --> 02:08:50,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Link it in Chatters.

1717
02:08:50,942 --> 02:08:52,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Chatters, you know what to do.

1718
02:08:52,603 --> 02:08:53,504
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Steve Guttenberg.

1719
02:08:54,164 --> 02:08:54,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck, follow him.

1720
02:08:55,204 --> 02:08:57,866
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to look and see if there's a Steve underscore Guttenberg.

1721
02:08:58,402 --> 02:08:59,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on.

1722
02:08:59,803 --> 02:09:00,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to the mailbag.

1723
02:09:00,764 --> 02:09:02,166
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta stop looking for me.

1724
02:09:02,186 --> 02:09:03,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Who do you mean, nope?

1725
02:09:03,687 --> 02:09:05,809
[SPEAKER_07]: No, there's not an underscore Steve Goober.

1726
02:09:05,829 --> 02:09:07,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you say no to the emailers.

1727
02:09:07,711 --> 02:09:09,453
[SPEAKER_07]: I just followed him, so whatever.

1728
02:09:09,533 --> 02:09:11,575
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like such a fucking sheep.

1729
02:09:11,675 --> 02:09:12,736
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go fucking follow him too.

1730
02:09:12,776 --> 02:09:13,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here we go.

1731
02:09:13,817 --> 02:09:14,378
[SPEAKER_04]: The emails.

1732
02:09:14,478 --> 02:09:16,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week you send us your fucking emails and we read them.

1733
02:09:16,880 --> 02:09:18,802
[SPEAKER_19]: He has an official website, so we'll figure it out in there.

1734
02:09:21,134 --> 02:09:33,221
[SPEAKER_04]: www.orangeloungeradio.com is our website and I think there's an email link there or just open up your email browser and go mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Read us the emails.

1735
02:09:33,501 --> 02:09:34,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, I'm sorry.

1736
02:09:36,063 --> 02:09:39,365
[SPEAKER_07]: The emails were hidden under Yahoo Japan stuff.

1737
02:09:39,705 --> 02:09:39,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1738
02:09:40,605 --> 02:09:42,226
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you fucking doing on Yahoo Japan?

1739
02:09:42,306 --> 02:09:43,087
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll tell you after the show.

1740
02:09:43,647 --> 02:09:44,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Why can't you tell me during the show?

1741
02:09:44,788 --> 02:09:45,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it juicy?

1742
02:09:45,688 --> 02:09:46,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck off.

1743
02:09:50,106 --> 02:09:50,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1744
02:09:51,027 --> 02:09:51,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1745
02:09:52,207 --> 02:09:53,488
[SPEAKER_07]: This comes from JammerJ.

1746
02:09:53,668 --> 02:09:53,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Woo!

1747
02:09:54,609 --> 02:09:56,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1748
02:09:56,210 --> 02:10:01,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Who, by the way, sent me a very nice Christmas card with a Sudoku puzzle in it.

1749
02:10:03,214 --> 02:10:06,356
[SPEAKER_04]: And... Isn't it fucking March and you're just now getting a Christmas card?

1750
02:10:06,396 --> 02:10:09,278
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I got... It bounced back.

1751
02:10:10,439 --> 02:10:12,360
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

1752
02:10:12,460 --> 02:10:16,123
[SPEAKER_07]: And he sent, like, I think an Eye of Judgment card or something?

1753
02:10:16,223 --> 02:10:16,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway...

1754
02:10:17,143 --> 02:10:23,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, here was a situation posed to me and I wanted to get OLR's thoughts on this since we are all about the same age.

1755
02:10:23,731 --> 02:10:25,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Here is the scenario my coworker gave me.

1756
02:10:26,615 --> 02:10:29,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Dave and my other coworkers would put the money into a pot.

1757
02:10:29,858 --> 02:10:33,222
[SPEAKER_07]: In order to win the pot, I would have to stop playing all video games for a month.

1758
02:10:33,923 --> 02:10:36,784
[SPEAKER_07]: I told him I would not do it and that it seemed a bit ridiculous to me.

1759
02:10:37,164 --> 02:10:41,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Dave's reasoning was that my life would get immediately better and that I would be a better person and go out more.

1760
02:10:41,785 --> 02:10:49,227
[SPEAKER_07]: The ironic thing was that we were dragged out to a country bar and shooting pool, which I did not enjoy as much, but I could do.

1761
02:10:49,407 --> 02:10:52,128
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we were all meh anyways being dragged there.

1762
02:10:52,768 --> 02:11:02,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, like many others, he sees the gaming lifestyle as negative and he does not know even really what means, like many others not in Idaho.

1763
02:11:05,796 --> 02:11:14,282
[SPEAKER_07]: I do a large amount of gaming, everything from Beatles Rock Band on 360 to World of Warcraft, but I balance this out with my weekly workouts, including DDR and my other grown-up things quotes.

1764
02:11:14,843 --> 02:11:17,124
[SPEAKER_07]: I am not a poop sucker.

1765
02:11:18,245 --> 02:11:25,630
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe that it is what makes us individuals to be different and that we can have different hobbies and interests different than others to enjoy life.

1766
02:11:26,030 --> 02:11:29,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the activities that people think are normal drinking, playing pool, partying...

1767
02:11:29,913 --> 02:11:33,257
[SPEAKER_07]: I have not done, but I feel empty doing them even with others.

1768
02:11:33,317 --> 02:11:36,660
[SPEAKER_07]: I would rather not conform and do what I enjoy by myself than to feel empty.

1769
02:11:37,201 --> 02:11:37,962
[SPEAKER_07]: So what do you guys think?

1770
02:11:38,082 --> 02:11:40,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there anything else I should say to him to back up my point?

1771
02:11:41,165 --> 02:11:47,452
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, in Idaho, what most consider normal is all outdoorsy stuff, floating, river hiking, camping, BSU football hunting.

1772
02:11:47,872 --> 02:11:48,753
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not from Idaho.

1773
02:11:48,853 --> 02:11:49,814
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a Floridian.

1774
02:11:50,535 --> 02:11:54,097
[SPEAKER_07]: This email has been brought to you by Red Robin, the home of the delicious Chop House Burger.

1775
02:11:54,437 --> 02:11:54,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, damn.

1776
02:11:54,957 --> 02:11:57,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm fucking hungry for one of those Western chicken burger things.

1777
02:11:57,979 --> 02:11:58,800
[SPEAKER_07]: We went to Fed Records today.

1778
02:11:59,460 --> 02:12:00,400
[SPEAKER_07]: I ate an ostrich burger.

1779
02:12:01,821 --> 02:12:02,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Yummy.

1780
02:12:02,421 --> 02:12:03,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking delicious.

1781
02:12:03,742 --> 02:12:04,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

1782
02:12:06,003 --> 02:12:07,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, first of all, I know a lot of Floridians.

1783
02:12:07,904 --> 02:12:11,506
[SPEAKER_07]: I lived about an hour from Pensacola, and a lot of them were rednecks.

1784
02:12:12,427 --> 02:12:13,688
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, all the same stuff.

1785
02:12:14,148 --> 02:12:14,488
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1786
02:12:14,868 --> 02:12:19,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Just tell them, like, you know, flat out say, I'm an individual.

1787
02:12:21,681 --> 02:12:25,464
[SPEAKER_07]: This is... I'm not going to change myself to please you.

1788
02:12:26,985 --> 02:12:31,209
[SPEAKER_04]: If he's your fucking friend, he should understand that there's some fucking things.

1789
02:12:31,309 --> 02:12:31,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

1790
02:12:31,789 --> 02:12:35,632
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if they're hanging out and going to country bars, he's a friend of some sort.

1791
02:12:36,053 --> 02:12:38,234
[SPEAKER_04]: If he's your fucking friend, he should understand there are things you like to do.

1792
02:12:38,254 --> 02:12:40,196
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not hurting anyone playing a video game.

1793
02:12:40,576 --> 02:12:43,719
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not doing nothing but playing video games.

1794
02:12:43,739 --> 02:12:45,040
[SPEAKER_04]: You're holding down a steady job.

1795
02:12:45,540 --> 02:12:48,663
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not anyone's place to tell another person how to live their life.

1796
02:12:49,784 --> 02:12:50,284
[SPEAKER_07]: End of story.

1797
02:12:51,837 --> 02:12:52,577
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

1798
02:13:16,227 --> 02:13:34,526
[SPEAKER_04]: but I think in return you should ask he should sit down and play a video game with you and try to find a game that you think he might like I mean you know your friend better than I do you might find that new Super Mario Brothers Wii is a game or maybe Call of Duty Modern Warfare is a game up to you my friend but if this guy's really your friend like

1799
02:13:35,767 --> 02:13:37,348
[SPEAKER_04]: And he should just take you as you are.

1800
02:13:37,488 --> 02:13:44,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if he's just a co-worker, then if he's a co-worker, then you get this whole other thing involved where if he's... It's to the point where he's annoying you.

1801
02:13:44,892 --> 02:13:46,613
[SPEAKER_04]: You have every right to tell him to stop talking to you.

1802
02:13:46,893 --> 02:13:49,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, like... Then again, that only really works in California.

1803
02:13:50,035 --> 02:13:53,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean... And I would hate that you would have to go that far with it, honestly.

1804
02:13:53,437 --> 02:13:53,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Just...

1805
02:13:55,982 --> 02:14:00,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Encourage him to be more open-minded and just let him know, hey, there's nothing wrong with video games.

1806
02:14:00,225 --> 02:14:05,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, Modern Warfare made more money than most Hollywood movies do.

1807
02:14:05,868 --> 02:14:07,529
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it is an art form.

1808
02:14:08,090 --> 02:14:08,410
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1809
02:14:08,470 --> 02:14:09,191
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know this guy.

1810
02:14:09,211 --> 02:14:12,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Final Fantasy XIII and the stories would touch him in a way.

1811
02:14:12,633 --> 02:14:14,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe some of his people that plays the deer hunter.

1812
02:14:14,814 --> 02:14:15,234
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1813
02:14:16,035 --> 02:14:17,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Which that game is actually kind of funny.

1814
02:14:18,056 --> 02:14:18,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1815
02:14:18,336 --> 02:14:19,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Next fucking email.

1816
02:14:19,657 --> 02:14:21,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Dear OLR, I finished Heavy Rain last Sunday.

1817
02:14:21,940 --> 02:14:26,907
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't affected by the PS3 clock glitch and was able to beat... Sorry.

1818
02:14:27,708 --> 02:14:31,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Beat off to and beat Heavy Rain with no problem at all.

1819
02:14:33,074 --> 02:14:34,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, oh, oh, special person.

1820
02:14:35,297 --> 02:14:39,738
[SPEAKER_07]: To me, Heavy Rain is comparable to a show like Rescue Me, Mad Men, and Burn Notice.

1821
02:14:39,778 --> 02:14:40,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Burn Notice is pretty cool.

1822
02:14:41,379 --> 02:14:42,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan likes Rescue Me.

1823
02:14:43,399 --> 02:14:51,902
[SPEAKER_07]: These are shows that would have been absolutely dull to me when I was a young teenager, but really deep and compelling now that I have matured into more adult tastes.

1824
02:14:52,382 --> 02:14:53,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you feel the same way?

1825
02:14:54,862 --> 02:14:59,444
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not shows that I enjoy, but I see why people like them.

1826
02:14:59,504 --> 02:15:00,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, Dan loves Rescue Me.

1827
02:15:01,004 --> 02:15:01,944
[SPEAKER_07]: I like Dennis Leary.

1828
02:15:02,365 --> 02:15:03,805
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he's pretty hilarious.

1829
02:15:04,505 --> 02:15:06,065
[SPEAKER_19]: I watched the end of Nip Tuck this week.

1830
02:15:07,506 --> 02:15:08,566
[SPEAKER_19]: It went out with a fizzle.

1831
02:15:09,967 --> 02:15:11,987
[SPEAKER_19]: It was just like, eh, we give up.

1832
02:15:14,688 --> 02:15:21,350
[SPEAKER_04]: I was really upset because there was no new RuPaul's Drag Race this week, but there was a new Project Runway, and I completely agreed with who they sent home.

1833
02:15:22,750 --> 02:15:23,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what we're talking about?

1834
02:15:25,891 --> 02:15:29,332
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's talking about serious dramas dealing with issues that people don't like to talk about.

1835
02:15:30,120 --> 02:15:39,866
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there are certainly some shows I didn't really watch as a kid that I could fucking appreciate a little more now that maybe I couldn't appreciate because I was too young to understand.

1836
02:15:40,546 --> 02:15:41,947
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure there were shows like that.

1837
02:15:41,987 --> 02:15:43,388
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't think of anything off the top of my head.

1838
02:15:43,508 --> 02:15:46,669
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a few shows though that grow up with you, if you know what I mean.

1839
02:15:47,430 --> 02:15:49,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Like watching freaking Rocky and Bullwinkle.

1840
02:15:49,511 --> 02:15:50,251
[SPEAKER_04]: or Beverly Hills 90210.

1841
02:15:51,152 --> 02:15:53,353
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I can't watch that new one.

1842
02:15:53,413 --> 02:15:55,254
[SPEAKER_04]: It's such bullshit compared to the old one.

1843
02:15:55,614 --> 02:15:58,135
[SPEAKER_04]: I fucking grew up with Brandon and Brenda.

1844
02:15:58,315 --> 02:16:00,917
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they're my homeboys.

1845
02:16:02,037 --> 02:16:03,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought she was on the show now.

1846
02:16:04,478 --> 02:16:06,719
[SPEAKER_04]: I think she did like a guest thing, but it's not the same.

1847
02:16:07,080 --> 02:16:08,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Now she's going to be on Dancing with the Stars.

1848
02:16:08,540 --> 02:16:09,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Jenny Garth is on it.

1849
02:16:10,101 --> 02:16:11,482
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, some of them are on the show.

1850
02:16:11,902 --> 02:16:13,383
[SPEAKER_19]: There was one I watched...

1851
02:16:14,443 --> 02:16:17,366
[SPEAKER_19]: God, I watch some weird TV when I'm at home sometimes.

1852
02:16:18,207 --> 02:16:20,589
[SPEAKER_19]: I watch this show, Overhaulin'.

1853
02:16:20,989 --> 02:16:25,153
[SPEAKER_19]: It's basically one of those, you know, they take a car and soup it up type shows.

1854
02:16:26,735 --> 02:16:34,402
[SPEAKER_19]: And they did one for, what's his name, Ian... I don't remember the guy's name...

1855
02:16:36,348 --> 02:16:37,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I need help with DJ Hero.

1856
02:16:37,809 --> 02:16:43,572
[SPEAKER_04]: I seem to be unable to perform the blue button scratch consistently and effectively.

1857
02:16:43,592 --> 02:16:47,415
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter which hand I use or whether the buttons are on the left or right of the turntable controller.

1858
02:16:47,475 --> 02:16:48,135
[SPEAKER_04]: I fail on a consistent basis.

1859
02:16:48,155 --> 02:16:50,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any tips you can give me, Loki?

1860
02:17:05,665 --> 02:17:08,306
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm surprised it's the blue one that you're having trouble with.

1861
02:17:08,466 --> 02:17:10,187
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that on the inside?

1862
02:17:10,867 --> 02:17:13,948
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of surprises me is that he has the same problem even if he flips.

1863
02:17:14,108 --> 02:17:16,709
[SPEAKER_04]: The first thing I would have said is play left-handed mode.

1864
02:17:16,789 --> 02:17:20,310
[SPEAKER_19]: It's probably the inside one, I'm guessing, because it's hard to get a grip on it.

1865
02:17:20,370 --> 02:17:27,632
[SPEAKER_19]: What you need to do is when you have your hand on the actual turntable is I normally put my thumb, I rest my thumb on the outside on the actual edge.

1866
02:17:28,232 --> 02:17:36,335
[SPEAKER_19]: of the turntable and use that to kind of move the turntable because if you just rely on the friction of your finger on that button, it's not going to work.

1867
02:17:36,355 --> 02:17:44,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you have to keep your thumb held down to create that kind of friction there or it's too loose and you'll get all these scratches you don't really want.

1868
02:17:44,819 --> 02:17:47,000
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to use your thumb to get the traction.

1869
02:17:47,020 --> 02:17:48,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's where your problem comes in.

1870
02:17:49,081 --> 02:17:49,701
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe.

1871
02:17:49,721 --> 02:17:51,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm afraid we're going to get a follow-up email like, I'm already doing that.

1872
02:17:52,769 --> 02:17:54,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then you just need to practice more.

1873
02:17:54,070 --> 02:17:56,550
[SPEAKER_04]: You might just have to take down, honestly, take down the difficulty.

1874
02:17:56,670 --> 02:18:04,213
[SPEAKER_04]: You might be playing on two, I think maybe you're, I don't know, I'm guessing maybe you're a long-time fan of Bomani, so you're trying to take it a little more aggressive.

1875
02:18:04,273 --> 02:18:06,434
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been meaning to do this, but I haven't done it yet.

1876
02:18:06,514 --> 02:18:08,855
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been meaning to take, like... Aggressively.

1877
02:18:09,915 --> 02:18:10,695
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an adverb.

1878
02:18:10,916 --> 02:18:11,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

1879
02:18:11,656 --> 02:18:12,856
[SPEAKER_19]: Fuck adverbs.

1880
02:18:13,216 --> 02:18:13,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah?

1881
02:18:13,616 --> 02:18:14,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, fuck you back.

1882
02:18:15,237 --> 02:18:21,320
[SPEAKER_19]: We need to take a metal plate or something like that and find the actual dead zones on each side.

1883
02:18:21,761 --> 02:18:32,926
[SPEAKER_19]: There's little dead zones where you can actually move the marker and it'll finally move all the way over to the left and right and just put a plate there so that basically it's just all center unless you go far right, far left.

1884
02:18:33,527 --> 02:18:38,029
[SPEAKER_19]: I hate it where you just don't go far enough or something like that and it doesn't register.

1885
02:18:38,049 --> 02:18:39,350
[SPEAKER_19]: That'd be kind of cool.

1886
02:18:39,830 --> 02:18:41,752
[SPEAKER_19]: I haven't fucking played DJ Hero in a while.

1887
02:18:41,792 --> 02:18:42,433
[SPEAKER_04]: I really need to.

1888
02:18:42,513 --> 02:18:43,113
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of disappointed.

1889
02:18:43,133 --> 02:18:44,355
[SPEAKER_07]: They dropped the price of them at Fry's.

1890
02:18:44,395 --> 02:18:45,436
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a ton of them there.

1891
02:18:45,496 --> 02:18:48,519
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really fucking disappointed they didn't support it better with more DLC.

1892
02:18:48,559 --> 02:18:50,440
[SPEAKER_04]: They have two download packs.

1893
02:18:50,460 --> 02:18:51,762
[SPEAKER_19]: They are not trying at all.

1894
02:18:51,782 --> 02:18:53,704
[SPEAKER_19]: They're like, eh, we released a couple.

1895
02:18:53,744 --> 02:18:54,965
[SPEAKER_19]: Now we're going to release a new game.

1896
02:18:55,145 --> 02:18:56,887
[SPEAKER_19]: They better blow my hair back at E3 with DJ Hero 2.

1897
02:19:00,051 --> 02:19:01,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if I can finish the email.

1898
02:19:02,253 --> 02:19:03,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course you fucking can.

1899
02:19:03,593 --> 02:19:07,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for taking my question and posting the podcast episodes in an expedient manner.

1900
02:19:07,736 --> 02:19:08,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Stay care, Redertainment.

1901
02:19:08,937 --> 02:19:10,938
[SPEAKER_07]: This message has been brought to you by the following words.

1902
02:19:11,059 --> 02:19:13,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck, shit, ass, piss, bitch, dumbass, cocksucker, motherfucker, damn.

1903
02:19:14,681 --> 02:19:15,982
[SPEAKER_04]: You are quite fucking welcome.

1904
02:19:16,402 --> 02:19:17,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, you know what?

1905
02:19:17,723 --> 02:19:19,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that on our fucking wiki?

1906
02:19:20,005 --> 02:19:23,307
[SPEAKER_07]: For in-show jokes, this message has been brought to you by...

1907
02:19:24,504 --> 02:19:24,864
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1908
02:19:25,145 --> 02:19:26,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone add it right the fuck now.

1909
02:19:26,766 --> 02:19:27,726
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to be fucking honest.

1910
02:19:27,746 --> 02:19:32,670
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't read the fucking wiki in a while, but I imagine it's getting updated tonight with the whole fuck show business.

1911
02:19:34,671 --> 02:19:35,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, OLR.

1912
02:19:36,333 --> 02:19:42,257
[SPEAKER_07]: I was listening to last week's show and I heard Jamie state that she really did not want to discuss the crazy things going on with GameCrazy.

1913
02:19:42,717 --> 02:19:45,519
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't figure out why until I found out her husband works for the company.

1914
02:19:45,979 --> 02:19:51,003
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a store manager for GameCrazy in Colorado and I think it would be interesting to hear the opinions and thoughts on what's going on

1915
02:19:51,363 --> 02:19:54,205
[SPEAKER_07]: especially coming from someone who works in a different district and region.

1916
02:19:54,625 --> 02:19:58,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Personally, I am very concerned of what's going on, and it would be interesting to chat about it on your show.

1917
02:19:59,228 --> 02:20:03,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Please do not use my name for obvious reasons, but please do respond.

1918
02:20:03,732 --> 02:20:06,453
[SPEAKER_07]: I love your show and look forward to downloading it every week.

1919
02:20:06,513 --> 02:20:06,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep it up.

1920
02:20:07,094 --> 02:20:08,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, someone!

1921
02:20:09,916 --> 02:20:10,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

1922
02:20:10,556 --> 02:20:11,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan!

1923
02:20:12,758 --> 02:20:14,239
[SPEAKER_07]: We need you for an editorial!

1924
02:20:14,259 --> 02:20:15,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh.

1925
02:20:16,500 --> 02:20:18,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie is summoning Dan to the OLR studio.

1926
02:20:23,490 --> 02:20:25,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell them to make them wait.

1927
02:20:26,951 --> 02:20:28,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Live radio, boys and girls.

1928
02:20:28,512 --> 02:20:29,552
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always a fucking mess.

1929
02:20:30,132 --> 02:20:38,335
[SPEAKER_04]: We do tape live Sunday nights at All Games Radio www.allgames.com where you can hear fucking train wrecks exploding live.

1930
02:20:38,755 --> 02:20:40,795
[SPEAKER_07]: They also did get to hear my Dan voice.

1931
02:20:42,816 --> 02:20:46,077
[SPEAKER_04]: But I can understand though if you don't want to fucking talk about it because it's a fucking day job.

1932
02:20:46,197 --> 02:20:48,278
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to put that shit at risk.

1933
02:20:48,338 --> 02:20:52,559
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would completely fucking understand if the answer is no fucking comment.

1934
02:20:52,881 --> 02:20:54,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we can ask him.

1935
02:20:54,282 --> 02:20:55,623
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Dan.

1936
02:20:56,544 --> 02:20:57,585
[SPEAKER_04]: A wild Dan has appeared.

1937
02:20:57,805 --> 02:21:03,630
[SPEAKER_07]: We got an email from a listener in Colorado who is a game crazy manager and wants to know.

1938
02:21:03,650 --> 02:21:04,130
[SPEAKER_00]: Sucks to be her.

1939
02:21:04,571 --> 02:21:04,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Him.

1940
02:21:05,291 --> 02:21:05,571
[SPEAKER_00]: Him.

1941
02:21:06,172 --> 02:21:09,675
[SPEAKER_07]: And he wants to know what your thoughts are on it being from a different region.

1942
02:21:10,696 --> 02:21:12,877
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't want to say anything on the show, you don't have to.

1943
02:21:13,097 --> 02:21:13,678
[SPEAKER_00]: About what?

1944
02:21:14,339 --> 02:21:17,241
[SPEAKER_07]: About the closures and how you feel and about what might be happening.

1945
02:21:19,463 --> 02:21:20,704
[SPEAKER_00]: Being out of money sucks.

1946
02:21:22,553 --> 02:21:31,255
[SPEAKER_00]: and the store's closing sucks and if more of you fuckers would shop there instead of going to GameStop, maybe we could stay.

1947
02:21:31,295 --> 02:21:32,715
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, it's not your guys' fault.

1948
02:21:33,035 --> 02:21:34,056
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your guys' fault.

1949
02:21:36,556 --> 02:21:37,577
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really not a lot to say.

1950
02:21:38,497 --> 02:21:39,457
[SPEAKER_00]: The economy's tough.

1951
02:21:39,897 --> 02:21:41,918
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of good people have lost jobs.

1952
02:21:42,538 --> 02:21:44,778
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of good people are hanging on.

1953
02:21:45,858 --> 02:21:48,279
[SPEAKER_19]: And Hollywood and movie gallery are really mismanaged.

1954
02:21:48,891 --> 02:21:49,471
[SPEAKER_19]: True that.

1955
02:21:51,052 --> 02:21:51,813
[SPEAKER_19]: On a corporate level.

1956
02:21:52,173 --> 02:21:52,533
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.

1957
02:21:52,553 --> 02:21:58,377
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's... Don't you work... I've dealt with movie gallery and they're like... No, no, exactly.

1958
02:21:58,477 --> 02:22:05,222
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a company that like didn't catch on to trends that were stupidly obvious 10 years ago.

1959
02:22:06,252 --> 02:22:06,672
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching!

1960
02:22:27,740 --> 02:22:41,592
[SPEAKER_00]: and that honestly enough that maybe if the bankruptcy works out, which it won't, and any of the game crazes end up staying open, which they probably won't, it would be really nice that the gamers will still have an alternative.

1961
02:22:44,280 --> 02:22:46,942
[SPEAKER_00]: To anyone else who works for the company, hey, I'm there with you.

1962
02:22:47,642 --> 02:22:48,142
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rough.

1963
02:22:48,403 --> 02:22:49,483
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't speak for them.

1964
02:22:49,523 --> 02:22:50,524
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to show up every day.

1965
02:22:50,544 --> 02:22:54,707
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to help my gamers and I recommend they do the same.

1966
02:22:55,287 --> 02:23:00,191
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a Game Craze in your area and you haven't gone there, hey, visit it while it's there.

1967
02:23:01,151 --> 02:23:04,934
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a chance and hopefully you'll like it.

1968
02:23:06,015 --> 02:23:07,556
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't, go to hell.

1969
02:23:08,316 --> 02:23:10,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we should do an SOS campaign.

1970
02:23:10,958 --> 02:23:11,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Save our stores.

1971
02:23:13,154 --> 02:23:19,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I appreciate Dan's perspective because, you know, there are some people that when it comes to the day job, they'd be like, I ain't fucking touching that shit with a fucking 10-foot pole.

1972
02:23:19,483 --> 02:23:22,607
[SPEAKER_04]: So I appreciate Dan speaking openly and candidly on the topic.

1973
02:23:22,827 --> 02:23:23,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, sweetie.

1974
02:23:25,253 --> 02:23:28,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Support not just independent radio, but support independent game stores.

1975
02:23:28,777 --> 02:23:34,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though GameCrazy isn't necessarily independent, it's important to point out they're not Walmart and they're not GameStop.

1976
02:23:34,262 --> 02:23:36,383
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's independent enough.

1977
02:23:37,264 --> 02:23:38,926
[SPEAKER_04]: They're a fucking endangered species.

1978
02:23:38,946 --> 02:23:39,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's right.

1979
02:23:40,367 --> 02:23:41,748
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like a goddamn unicorn.

1980
02:23:41,768 --> 02:23:46,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the kind that Loki's been playing with all week on that game.

1981
02:23:47,153 --> 02:23:47,513
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

1982
02:23:47,554 --> 02:23:50,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any more fucking... You know, I actually went and downloaded that song.

1983
02:23:51,368 --> 02:24:11,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Always, I wanna be you Hey, we got another one from G-Ditz Hello there, OLR, this is G-Ditz writing in I'm the Swedish dude who called in a few shows ago and talked about the DRM and seeing as how exams are closing in Did I read this one already?

1984
02:24:13,216 --> 02:24:14,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't it really long?

1985
02:24:14,437 --> 02:24:17,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you did He must have re-sent this

1986
02:24:19,505 --> 02:24:35,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, and we also got one from Rababa with the stuff about Portal and the boing boing boing, which we already talked about.

1987
02:24:36,862 --> 02:24:38,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Portal at Circuit City R.A.P.

1988
02:24:38,583 --> 02:24:40,225
[SPEAKER_07]: when it was released a la carte.

1989
02:24:40,865 --> 02:24:41,986
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have to see what it's all about.

1990
02:24:42,066 --> 02:24:43,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Viral marketing at its best.

1991
02:24:43,367 --> 02:24:45,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, Orange Box is only like $19.99 now, right?

1992
02:24:46,028 --> 02:24:47,329
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really fucking cheap.

1993
02:24:47,389 --> 02:24:48,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

1994
02:24:48,330 --> 02:24:49,150
[SPEAKER_04]: What a fucking steal.

1995
02:24:49,190 --> 02:24:51,572
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have an Xbox 360 or PC or whatever.

1996
02:24:51,592 --> 02:24:52,393
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good deal.

1997
02:24:52,453 --> 02:24:54,774
[SPEAKER_04]: I really wish I had the game.

1998
02:24:55,114 --> 02:24:55,615
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

1999
02:24:56,135 --> 02:24:57,456
[SPEAKER_19]: I just didn't play it a lot.

2000
02:24:58,096 --> 02:24:58,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Moved on.

2001
02:24:58,937 --> 02:24:59,537
[SPEAKER_04]: I may go back.

2002
02:24:59,797 --> 02:25:01,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you fucking done with the fucking emails?

2003
02:25:02,339 --> 02:25:02,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2004
02:25:02,860 --> 02:25:05,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, then you should send us your fucking opinion.

2005
02:25:05,162 --> 02:25:06,163
[SPEAKER_04]: It's where every gamer has a voice.

2006
02:25:06,243 --> 02:25:08,785
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm replying to the GameCrazyGuy, so email him.

2007
02:25:09,706 --> 02:25:13,349
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be fucking curious, you know, whatever you can read on the show, obviously.

2008
02:25:13,769 --> 02:25:16,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to send us some fucking emails.

2009
02:25:17,533 --> 02:25:20,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, it's time to do the FUs of the week.

2010
02:25:20,415 --> 02:25:21,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, we're still having them tonight.

2011
02:25:21,937 --> 02:25:23,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because it's a fuck show doesn't mean we abandon this segment.

2012
02:25:23,798 --> 02:25:24,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, OrangeBoxes1999.

2013
02:25:24,419 --> 02:25:24,459
[SPEAKER_04]: 1799Us.

2014
02:25:28,769 --> 02:25:30,715
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a big story to inspire this tonight.

2015
02:25:40,731 --> 02:25:46,212
[SPEAKER_04]: As if the whole fucking reason for tonight's show weren't enough reason to be angry, let me give you a little something extra here.

2016
02:25:46,992 --> 02:26:00,156
[SPEAKER_04]: A Korean couple this week has made the news for neglecting their infant to the point where the infant starved because they were addicted to online games at internet cafes.

2017
02:26:00,736 --> 02:26:05,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you might want to take this with a grain of salt because it's coming from the sun, but still, sadly...

2018
02:26:07,037 --> 02:26:10,558
[SPEAKER_19]: But I trust the sun with all of its sunlight and nutrients.

2019
02:26:10,578 --> 02:26:11,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the irony.

2020
02:26:11,358 --> 02:26:15,099
[SPEAKER_04]: They were raising a virtual toddler in a game called Prius Online.

2021
02:26:15,139 --> 02:26:16,319
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty much Second Life.

2022
02:26:16,999 --> 02:26:22,660
[SPEAKER_04]: But while they were doing this, they'd leave their real one at home alone each day with just a bottle of milk for nourishment.

2023
02:26:22,720 --> 02:26:24,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, it's even worse than Clara from The Guild.

2024
02:26:24,960 --> 02:26:27,281
[SPEAKER_04]: At least, like, she's sitting in the same room with them.

2025
02:26:27,921 --> 02:26:32,742
[SPEAKER_04]: One day, they came home to find the child dead and called the cops, claiming that they found the kid dead when they woke up.

2026
02:26:36,251 --> 02:26:41,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Investigators found, though, that the child was dehydrated and decided that the couple's story was full of bullshit.

2027
02:26:41,972 --> 02:26:42,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Good for them.

2028
02:26:42,412 --> 02:26:43,173
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just pathetic.

2029
02:26:43,933 --> 02:26:45,733
[SPEAKER_04]: This is all disgusting, honestly.

2030
02:26:47,493 --> 02:26:49,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, what else can you say?

2031
02:26:49,214 --> 02:26:54,475
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of sad you don't have to take an IQ test to reproduce.

2032
02:26:54,835 --> 02:27:00,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, some days I really wish you had to take an IQ test in order to successfully have an orgasm.

2033
02:27:00,536 --> 02:27:01,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm almost there.

2034
02:27:01,836 --> 02:27:02,557
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm almost there.

2035
02:27:02,917 --> 02:27:03,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, what's two plus two?

2036
02:27:05,531 --> 02:27:06,072
[SPEAKER_04]: I forget.

2037
02:27:07,895 --> 02:27:08,336
[SPEAKER_04]: No, baby.

2038
02:27:10,240 --> 02:27:14,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, if that doesn't inspire some angst within you, then I don't know what else will.

2039
02:27:14,228 --> 02:27:15,571
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what's your FU of the week?

2040
02:27:15,987 --> 02:27:18,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you whoever hacked my Gaia account.

2041
02:27:19,528 --> 02:27:27,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah, I had about, um, a million in gold stolen and some of my expensive items.

2042
02:27:27,432 --> 02:27:32,094
[SPEAKER_07]: And, yeah, I play on it as sort of like a little, oh, I'm wasting time thing.

2043
02:27:32,174 --> 02:27:34,995
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's just that, it's just shitty, you know?

2044
02:27:35,275 --> 02:27:37,316
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want people to give me my money back, so.

2045
02:27:39,197 --> 02:27:40,497
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just completely horrible.

2046
02:27:41,958 --> 02:27:42,778
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really it, though.

2047
02:27:42,878 --> 02:27:45,079
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that and having no time to get my stuff finished.

2048
02:27:46,420 --> 02:27:46,680
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki!

2049
02:27:47,521 --> 02:28:01,577
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm tired, so this isn't as heartfelt as it was in the beginning of the show, but fuck you to the asshole that stole my 360 and my mod chip and my $60 that was gonna pay for installing the mod chip.

2050
02:28:03,138 --> 02:28:06,680
[SPEAKER_19]: and wasting my entire day and making me have to drive down to Stockton.

2051
02:28:07,080 --> 02:28:09,901
[SPEAKER_19]: Because Stockton sucks and having to drive back from Stockton.

2052
02:28:11,142 --> 02:28:11,422
[SPEAKER_19]: Angry.

2053
02:28:12,003 --> 02:28:12,303
[SPEAKER_19]: Angry.

2054
02:28:13,023 --> 02:28:13,283
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2055
02:28:14,264 --> 02:28:15,444
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I was so pissed off.

2056
02:28:16,525 --> 02:28:20,447
[SPEAKER_19]: And not only that, waiting four hours in a car in front of an apartment complex.

2057
02:28:20,727 --> 02:28:21,867
[SPEAKER_19]: Which I assumed was his.

2058
02:28:22,688 --> 02:28:23,988
[SPEAKER_19]: It might not be at this point.

2059
02:28:25,449 --> 02:28:27,952
[SPEAKER_19]: I am going to email him this week, though, to give him a chance.

2060
02:28:28,233 --> 02:28:29,554
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe there was some misunderstanding.

2061
02:28:29,594 --> 02:28:34,199
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe his phone fucked up and he just didn't get any of my messages at the very end.

2062
02:28:34,620 --> 02:28:35,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe not.

2063
02:28:35,641 --> 02:28:38,884
[SPEAKER_19]: Or maybe not, but hey, I'm going to give him an opportunity to ship me that console.

2064
02:28:38,924 --> 02:28:42,789
[SPEAKER_19]: If he doesn't, then I'm going to fucking post his email and his phone number all over the internet, so...

2065
02:28:43,476 --> 02:28:44,097
[SPEAKER_19]: Good fucking luck.

2066
02:28:44,977 --> 02:28:45,998
[SPEAKER_04]: He has an iPhone, I know that.

2067
02:28:46,779 --> 02:28:48,501
[SPEAKER_04]: He pissed off a radio show host, be warned.

2068
02:28:50,263 --> 02:28:51,464
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a lot of FUs this week.

2069
02:28:51,504 --> 02:28:55,488
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually do have a big FU, but it's not one I want to state on the show because it's a sensitive matter.

2070
02:28:56,409 --> 02:29:00,653
[SPEAKER_04]: So just FU to feeling underappreciated.

2071
02:29:00,673 --> 02:29:01,514
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just leave it at that.

2072
02:29:04,136 --> 02:29:04,797
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it for the FUs.

2073
02:29:06,570 --> 02:29:07,331
[SPEAKER_04]: More fuck show.

2074
02:29:07,391 --> 02:29:08,932
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple of fucking stories for you guys.

2075
02:29:09,332 --> 02:29:10,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what do you got on deck?

2076
02:29:10,973 --> 02:29:17,878
[SPEAKER_19]: So, apparently there's some fucking new design for the DS cartridge that's come out in a patent filing.

2077
02:29:18,478 --> 02:29:23,081
[SPEAKER_19]: It looks like a new DS cartridge that's a little bit longer than the normal DS cartridge.

2078
02:29:23,882 --> 02:29:25,242
[SPEAKER_19]: It's got... I don't even know.

2079
02:29:25,263 --> 02:29:29,345
[SPEAKER_19]: It looks almost like a button or something on the end of the cartridge there.

2080
02:29:29,405 --> 02:29:33,788
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe either for some sort of rewrite thing or possibly...

2081
02:29:35,609 --> 02:29:56,685
[SPEAKER_19]: God knows if you ask me, because it's hard to tell based just off this little picture, but people are thinking that maybe it's some sort of expansion device that they're making for the DSi or something like that to allow other peripherals that you might use on, say, for example, the Game Boy Advance slot, like maybe a new Guitar Hero type thing.

2082
02:29:57,085 --> 02:29:58,286
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what this makes me think of?

2083
02:29:58,726 --> 02:29:58,866
[SPEAKER_19]: What?

2084
02:29:58,946 --> 02:30:01,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Is the Rumble Pack that they put out for Pokemon Pinball.

2085
02:30:01,748 --> 02:30:29,923
[SPEAKER_19]: um you know it kind of looks like to me almost like some sort of wireless card or something like that but the DS you know already has wireless on it um it's just that button on top it almost looks like a sink or some sort of device maybe a motion controller type thing something like that maybe the button resets you know the orientation or some shit like that who knows we'll find out later on when this actually comes out um whatever the hell it is that they're using this for oh I don't know maybe around E3 yeah

2086
02:30:31,403 --> 02:30:31,803
[SPEAKER_04]: It is shit.

2087
02:30:56,198 --> 02:31:03,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I got one more fucking story for you guys and we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.

2088
02:31:03,102 --> 02:31:04,683
[SPEAKER_04]: The three minute rule is in effect tonight.

2089
02:31:05,063 --> 02:31:09,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Phone calls will be limited to three minutes so that every fucking gamer can have a voice tonight.

2090
02:31:10,106 --> 02:31:12,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Valve Games are on their way to the Macintosh.

2091
02:31:13,388 --> 02:31:13,868
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

2092
02:31:14,168 --> 02:31:20,331
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess there were some rumors about fucking Steam going to the Macintosh because of some fucking files that were found in the latest beta build.

2093
02:31:20,751 --> 02:31:26,833
[SPEAKER_04]: But Valve has basically hinted very strongly that the games are coming to the Mac.

2094
02:31:27,694 --> 02:31:32,715
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess Doug Lombardi, the VP of Marketing over at Valve, actually kind of gave the official confirmation.

2095
02:31:33,896 --> 02:31:35,857
[SPEAKER_04]: But no release dates or anything like that.

2096
02:31:37,137 --> 02:31:45,300
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's pretty fucking understood that Team Fortress 2, Half-Life, Left 4 Dead, Portal, those are all big, big possibilities.

2097
02:31:45,360 --> 02:31:51,582
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be noted Team Fortress 2 is used in some type of little campaign there that is kind of a parody of the Apple ads.

2098
02:31:52,062 --> 02:31:58,165
[SPEAKER_04]: So some fucking Mac users are going to be very fucking excited, especially with a game like Portal and all those games, really.

2099
02:31:58,225 --> 02:31:59,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Valve makes some pretty fucking awesome games.

2100
02:32:00,105 --> 02:32:01,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are all going to be worth playing.

2101
02:32:01,146 --> 02:32:01,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're pretty cool.

2102
02:32:03,035 --> 02:32:03,356
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

2103
02:32:03,597 --> 02:32:09,452
[SPEAKER_04]: They're pretty cool Yep So even Loki can support that on the Mac More games for the Mac, Loki That's all you ever wanted, right?

2104
02:32:10,436 --> 02:32:12,357
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't want anything for the Mac, and I don't care.

2105
02:32:12,377 --> 02:32:16,520
[SPEAKER_19]: That's why I didn't want to release more games to the Mac, because there are people that buy those PCs.

2106
02:32:17,020 --> 02:32:18,962
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't understand why, but whatever.

2107
02:32:19,522 --> 02:32:21,784
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, make the money where they can.

2108
02:32:23,004 --> 02:32:27,287
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to share, while Loki was reading his last fucking story, I ran out to the fucking car.

2109
02:32:27,347 --> 02:32:28,388
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, the skyline's open.

2110
02:32:28,408 --> 02:32:29,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead and call 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2111
02:32:30,509 --> 02:32:34,652
[SPEAKER_04]: I ran out to the fucking car to get more of these PETA chips, which I've become really fucking addicted to.

2112
02:32:35,593 --> 02:32:36,794
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is a different brand.

2113
02:32:36,814 --> 02:32:39,836
[SPEAKER_04]: These are from Trader Joe's, and these are reduced guilt.

2114
02:32:40,476 --> 02:32:41,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they're not as fatty.

2115
02:32:41,717 --> 02:32:42,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Sea Salt Chips.

2116
02:32:42,397 --> 02:32:43,858
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've gotten Jamie addicted to them.

2117
02:32:43,898 --> 02:32:44,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

2118
02:32:44,918 --> 02:32:46,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no, I almost bought myself some.

2119
02:32:47,479 --> 02:32:50,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only is it the Stacy's brand is really good, but these are really good too.

2120
02:32:50,241 --> 02:32:52,122
[SPEAKER_04]: These are almost better in some ways than Trader Joe's ones.

2121
02:32:52,242 --> 02:32:54,062
[SPEAKER_07]: And they have cinnamon and sugar ones at Trader Joe's too.

2122
02:32:54,163 --> 02:32:54,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes they do.

2123
02:32:54,583 --> 02:32:55,123
[SPEAKER_04]: They have cheddar.

2124
02:32:55,143 --> 02:32:56,063
[SPEAKER_04]: They have all the different flavors.

2125
02:32:56,564 --> 02:32:57,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Very fucking delicious.

2126
02:32:58,264 --> 02:33:00,045
[SPEAKER_04]: I give props to Pita Chips.

2127
02:33:00,085 --> 02:33:01,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, our calls are coming in.

2128
02:33:01,046 --> 02:33:01,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's kick it off.

2129
02:33:03,587 --> 02:33:05,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the Orange Launch Radio Fuck Show.

2130
02:33:05,208 --> 02:33:05,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2131
02:33:07,153 --> 02:33:08,713
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, uh, fucking Spazinator.

2132
02:33:08,793 --> 02:33:11,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, fucking Spazinator, it's been a long fucking time.

2133
02:33:11,554 --> 02:33:13,275
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the latest with you and Sony?

2134
02:33:15,235 --> 02:33:33,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, at least in my fucking opinion, uh, this whole, uh, clock, you know, fucking deal is, uh, you put another, you know, nail into the fucking coffin, so, uh, you know, it just seems like fucking Sony can't do anything right, so, um,

2135
02:33:34,420 --> 02:33:54,937
[SPEAKER_09]: But on a positive note, I did speak to a Sony rep not too long ago, and they gave me another story saying that, yeah, once I send my system in, if they have to send me another system, they'll reauthorize me to download all my videos.

2136
02:33:55,017 --> 02:33:57,179
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said,

2137
02:33:58,855 --> 02:34:01,156
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, did you start to say something there?

2138
02:34:01,396 --> 02:34:03,737
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I was just going to say, at least they're offering that.

2139
02:34:03,797 --> 02:34:05,417
[SPEAKER_04]: That seems like fucking more than you got before.

2140
02:34:06,918 --> 02:34:08,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2141
02:34:08,158 --> 02:34:13,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, even with that being said, I would still say that the DRR pretty much fucking sucks.

2142
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:15,120
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

2143
02:34:15,200 --> 02:34:19,642
[SPEAKER_09]: No one should have to go through this kind of BS every single time.

2144
02:34:20,442 --> 02:34:22,623
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, something goes up and then it goes down.

2145
02:34:22,743 --> 02:34:23,623
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

2146
02:34:24,378 --> 02:34:30,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, like I mentioned time and time before, you know, I'm so of a big Sony fan.

2147
02:34:30,520 --> 02:34:36,302
[SPEAKER_09]: As you mentioned, I tend to pimp out, you know, this, that, or dollar on your show.

2148
02:34:36,342 --> 02:34:38,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking PSN is in your fucking Twitter name.

2149
02:34:38,903 --> 02:34:41,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you are definitely a Sony fanboy, and that's okay.

2150
02:34:41,603 --> 02:34:43,824
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you've been pretty good.

2151
02:34:43,864 --> 02:34:46,405
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not, like, you've been fair.

2152
02:34:46,465 --> 02:34:48,406
[SPEAKER_04]: You give Sony a bad time when they deserve it.

2153
02:34:48,806 --> 02:34:52,687
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of sad that Sony would be, you know, pissing off a loyal fan like you.

2154
02:34:54,201 --> 02:34:59,682
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't set my system in just yet because I'm a few bucks short to cover the repairs I should have all the money in place

2155
02:35:23,991 --> 02:35:27,114
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, good fucking luck to you, Spazinator.

2156
02:35:27,194 --> 02:35:32,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else you want to get out with the last few seconds you have tonight?

2157
02:35:32,599 --> 02:35:34,040
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, thank you very much.

2158
02:35:48,064 --> 02:35:49,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, great fucking show.

2159
02:35:49,625 --> 02:35:51,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, really fucking appreciate it.

2160
02:35:51,365 --> 02:35:53,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a great fucking night, my man.

2161
02:35:54,606 --> 02:35:56,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Spazinator, poor guy having the Sony troubles.

2162
02:35:57,747 --> 02:36:02,769
[SPEAKER_04]: At least they're offering to re-authenticate another system, but it's just such a big pain in the ass.

2163
02:36:02,789 --> 02:36:03,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Why can't things just work?

2164
02:36:04,329 --> 02:36:05,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Why can't electronics just work?

2165
02:36:05,870 --> 02:36:08,631
[SPEAKER_04]: You buy them and you fucking expect them to fucking work.

2166
02:36:09,631 --> 02:36:12,092
[SPEAKER_04]: We have any last minute stories to fucking get out there?

2167
02:36:12,152 --> 02:36:12,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wait, we got another call.

2168
02:36:13,232 --> 02:36:14,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on one minute, DarkSakura.

2169
02:36:14,492 --> 02:36:16,053
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll let you jump in right after this call.

2170
02:36:17,537 --> 02:36:18,878
[SPEAKER_04]: You're on the Orange Lounge Radio Fuck Show.

2171
02:36:18,918 --> 02:36:19,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2172
02:36:20,960 --> 02:36:25,165
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Legend of Zaku watching the Oscars and doing this at the same time.

2173
02:36:25,645 --> 02:36:27,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck the Oscars.

2174
02:36:27,487 --> 02:36:31,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Bunch of fucking sucking each other's dicks with these awards.

2175
02:36:31,731 --> 02:36:32,572
[SPEAKER_04]: We all know who's going to win.

2176
02:36:32,592 --> 02:36:33,513
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't fucking matter.

2177
02:36:33,553 --> 02:36:34,894
[SPEAKER_04]: They bumped it up to ten movies.

2178
02:36:34,954 --> 02:36:36,136
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a two movie race anyway.

2179
02:36:36,476 --> 02:36:37,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, what's on your mind tonight?

2180
02:36:38,463 --> 02:36:43,948
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess the word fuck could probably apply to someone who probably some entity deserves it.

2181
02:36:44,048 --> 02:36:45,349
[SPEAKER_14]: Case in point, Activision.

2182
02:36:46,050 --> 02:36:46,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, yes.

2183
02:36:46,470 --> 02:36:49,733
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all spat that happened recently.

2184
02:36:50,273 --> 02:36:51,655
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your take on the whole fucking thing?

2185
02:36:52,335 --> 02:36:52,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

2186
02:36:53,136 --> 02:36:54,517
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your take on the whole fucking thing?

2187
02:36:55,758 --> 02:36:57,780
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I knew it was on its way.

2188
02:36:57,800 --> 02:36:59,061
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I knew it was going to happen.

2189
02:36:59,281 --> 02:37:00,422
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a matter of when.

2190
02:37:00,962 --> 02:37:03,765
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, the writing was on the wall when Infinity Ward...

2191
02:37:04,639 --> 02:37:08,800
[SPEAKER_14]: was actually next to dedicated servers for Modern Warfare 2.

2192
02:37:09,340 --> 02:37:14,962
[SPEAKER_14]: You knew that it was something that they probably didn't want to do, but they had someone's hand probably force them.

2193
02:37:16,522 --> 02:37:32,027
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's kind of... In other words, the way I see it is that... I don't know, I guess Activision's trying to bring forth the great video game crash that almost happened but never did.

2194
02:37:34,076 --> 02:37:35,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you talking about the one that happened in the 80s?

2195
02:37:35,497 --> 02:37:37,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that really did happen.

2196
02:37:39,978 --> 02:37:58,845
[SPEAKER_14]: The way you see it is that you have a company that's literally saturating the market, basically trying to bleed all their franchises dry and just minimizing the amount of properties that sustain them.

2197
02:37:58,885 --> 02:37:59,485
[SPEAKER_14]: In other words, if

2198
02:38:00,140 --> 02:38:06,806
[SPEAKER_14]: If it only comes down to Tony Hawk, Call of Duty, Guitar Hero bringing their only bread and butter, that's kind of dangerous.

2199
02:38:07,346 --> 02:38:09,988
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's going to cause another fucking video game crash, though.

2200
02:38:10,028 --> 02:38:12,370
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the video game crash happened for so many other reasons.

2201
02:38:12,891 --> 02:38:23,559
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you get to the point where Guitar Hero is pretty much panned, no matter what new release comes out, because they already know it's going to be the same thing, same drivel.

2202
02:38:24,140 --> 02:38:25,261
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not going to be worth the effort.

2203
02:38:25,301 --> 02:38:27,563
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, the last two proved that point.

2204
02:38:28,263 --> 02:38:29,104
[SPEAKER_14]: And when Tony Hawk

2205
02:38:29,768 --> 02:38:32,753
[SPEAKER_14]: Tony Hawk Ride pretty much bombed for all intents and purposes.

2206
02:38:33,373 --> 02:38:39,402
[SPEAKER_14]: It goes to show that they're not innovating but just releasing the same thing and trying to nickel and dime people.

2207
02:38:39,972 --> 02:38:41,914
[SPEAKER_07]: No innovation, more renovation?

2208
02:38:42,234 --> 02:38:44,616
[SPEAKER_19]: I think they tried to innovate, it's just it sucked.

2209
02:38:45,257 --> 02:38:49,340
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, yeah, it's just the fact that they're not trying anything original like EA.

2210
02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:52,543
[SPEAKER_14]: EA's learning their lesson already.

2211
02:38:53,384 --> 02:38:59,969
[SPEAKER_14]: So you see Mirror's Edge, Dead Space, Mass Effect, because they're actually realizing that you can't put...

2212
02:39:01,803 --> 02:39:05,946
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't milk the same cow over and over and expect the same result.

2213
02:39:06,187 --> 02:39:11,932
[SPEAKER_19]: It just came down to where they basically had their control system in place and it worked okay for Tony Hawk.

2214
02:39:12,332 --> 02:39:15,875
[SPEAKER_19]: And then Skate came out and had a slightly better control system.

2215
02:39:15,895 --> 02:39:18,697
[SPEAKER_14]: That's where EA basically knew how to innovate.

2216
02:39:19,458 --> 02:39:26,043
[SPEAKER_14]: They found a way to create a skateboarding game that was outside of the status quo.

2217
02:39:26,504 --> 02:39:28,886
[SPEAKER_14]: Outside of what Tony Hawk has offered.

2218
02:39:30,066 --> 02:39:39,118
[SPEAKER_14]: So you see right there, when you feel to innovate, the only thing you have is whatever you're able to market and whatever you're able to litigate.

2219
02:39:39,485 --> 02:39:44,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I gotta jump in and call time on the call because we're on three minute limit tonight, but thank you, Zaku, as always, for your perspective.

2220
02:39:45,707 --> 02:39:46,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a fucking great night.

2221
02:39:47,407 --> 02:39:47,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

2222
02:39:49,268 --> 02:39:50,668
[SPEAKER_04]: We do appreciate Zaku's perspective.

2223
02:39:50,728 --> 02:39:52,169
[SPEAKER_04]: And a gold fucking star for Zaku.

2224
02:39:52,229 --> 02:39:54,189
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not hear much bam-bam-bamming on the keyboard.

2225
02:39:54,749 --> 02:40:00,331
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard little taps, but no worse than when Jamie points the mic at her keyboard.

2226
02:40:00,751 --> 02:40:01,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2227
02:40:02,832 --> 02:40:03,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Love you, mean it.

2228
02:40:03,872 --> 02:40:09,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Jamie, you had a last minute story for us tonight, speaking of which, while we wait for another call at 877-GAME-OLR on our fuck show.

2229
02:40:10,136 --> 02:40:12,618
[SPEAKER_07]: I did, and it was... Oh, jeez, sounds awfully loud.

2230
02:40:13,238 --> 02:40:19,962
[SPEAKER_07]: I did, and it was when, actually, our good friend Marin left, posted today, and I thought it was really neat.

2231
02:40:20,463 --> 02:40:21,143
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to share it.

2232
02:40:22,564 --> 02:40:23,285
[SPEAKER_07]: There is...

2233
02:40:27,069 --> 02:40:42,620
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a report that is about a guy named Roy Williams who played through Ocarina of Time blindfolded to write a guide on how to play the game only by using sound clues so that...

2234
02:40:46,506 --> 02:40:49,791
[SPEAKER_07]: A visually impaired player could beat the game.

2235
02:40:50,472 --> 02:41:00,385
[SPEAKER_07]: And so him and three other guys took two years to write this, but Jordan Werner, who was living in Ontario, beat the game.

2236
02:41:03,088 --> 02:41:03,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that nice?

2237
02:41:04,500 --> 02:41:06,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's cool.

2238
02:41:06,201 --> 02:41:17,384
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I know we have some blind gamers listen to this show that, you know, often kind of talk about, you know, using the kind of the sound cues in the games and being able to kind of play the games that way.

2239
02:41:17,464 --> 02:41:27,468
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's cool that people kind of go out of their way to write things with sound cues and so forth in these FAQs so that everybody can really enjoy video games in one way or another.

2240
02:41:27,608 --> 02:41:28,368
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's a great story.

2241
02:41:29,108 --> 02:41:29,829
[SPEAKER_04]: The black guy is sassy

2242
02:41:56,644 --> 02:41:59,405
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry, it's just that he just comes out kind of sassy.

2243
02:42:13,312 --> 02:42:16,714
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to admit, Ranma, Barret was kind of a little bit fucking sassy too.

2244
02:42:17,075 --> 02:42:19,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Barret was freaking hardcore.

2245
02:42:19,116 --> 02:42:20,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Barret was a badass.

2246
02:42:20,837 --> 02:42:22,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Saz is sassy in a different way.

2247
02:42:22,978 --> 02:42:27,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, dude, Ranma, he has a fucking chocobo living in his fucking afro.

2248
02:42:27,781 --> 02:42:28,382
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

2249
02:42:28,682 --> 02:42:36,427
[SPEAKER_04]: But there is, you sense that there is, like, again, I don't want to give story spoilers, but you sense that there is a definitely deeper story to him.

2250
02:42:36,507 --> 02:42:40,269
[SPEAKER_04]: He's not just completely transparent comic relief a la Janssen.

2251
02:42:41,790 --> 02:42:44,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Jansen was kind of sassy in Lost Odyssey.

2252
02:42:44,073 --> 02:42:48,798
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, they never explained right away, at least where I'm at, why he's even with them right now.

2253
02:42:49,318 --> 02:42:52,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but flashbacks will tell you a little later.

2254
02:42:52,722 --> 02:42:54,563
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's all Lost style, remember.

2255
02:42:55,745 --> 02:42:57,286
[SPEAKER_04]: But he's a little bit sassy.

2256
02:42:58,227 --> 02:42:59,388
[SPEAKER_04]: It's better than Ranma...

2257
02:43:00,129 --> 02:43:03,572
[SPEAKER_04]: He's actually, I will say, he is my favorite character in the game right now.

2258
02:43:03,912 --> 02:43:10,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Because everybody else is, in my opinion, kind of such a stereotype of the Final Fantasy VII characters in a way.

2259
02:43:10,198 --> 02:43:10,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

2260
02:43:10,578 --> 02:43:11,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I really, I like him.

2261
02:43:11,939 --> 02:43:12,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he's really interesting.

2262
02:43:12,840 --> 02:43:15,562
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Chocobo in the Afro is so fucking adorable.

2263
02:43:16,683 --> 02:43:18,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Is he like RuPaul sassy or just sassy?

2264
02:43:18,985 --> 02:43:20,766
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, he's not like... Is he cheeky?

2265
02:43:20,786 --> 02:43:22,228
[SPEAKER_04]: He's not like, bitch, you better work.

2266
02:43:22,268 --> 02:43:23,228
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just the comic relief.

2267
02:43:23,249 --> 02:43:23,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Is he cheeky?

2268
02:43:24,309 --> 02:43:24,690
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit.

2269
02:43:24,710 --> 02:43:25,651
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a little bit cheeky.

2270
02:43:25,791 --> 02:43:26,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheeky.

2271
02:43:26,331 --> 02:43:27,092
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a little bit cheeky.

2272
02:43:30,022 --> 02:43:32,283
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, when you say sassy, I think of your sassy pants.

2273
02:43:33,063 --> 02:43:34,623
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a whole different kind of sassy.

2274
02:43:34,663 --> 02:43:37,303
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes me think, though, of RuPaul.

2275
02:43:37,864 --> 02:43:40,104
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why, but RuPaul makes me think sassy.

2276
02:43:41,144 --> 02:43:41,644
[SPEAKER_07]: And Tyra.

2277
02:43:42,124 --> 02:43:49,086
[SPEAKER_19]: He does say, and I had to laugh because of the lethal weapon reference, I'm getting too old for this.

2278
02:43:49,686 --> 02:43:50,686
[SPEAKER_19]: He does, he does.

2279
02:43:51,206 --> 02:43:51,806
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, fuck.

2280
02:43:52,186 --> 02:43:56,487
[SPEAKER_07]: I still don't think that no one is going to ever top Cid for the attitude.

2281
02:43:57,708 --> 02:44:00,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Sit your ass down in that chair and drink your goddamn tea.

2282
02:44:01,231 --> 02:44:06,494
[SPEAKER_04]: But Ranma, be happy because I think they actually have a black guy doing his voice.

2283
02:44:08,196 --> 02:44:17,843
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I will soon find out because I don't know if you guys realize because Otakon is in a few fucking months and guess who's going to have to cosplay this guy?

2284
02:44:18,408 --> 02:44:19,069
[SPEAKER_04]: You are.

2285
02:44:19,609 --> 02:44:21,892
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, everyone's like, you have to cosplay this guy.

2286
02:44:21,912 --> 02:44:23,493
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm like, oh, fuck.

2287
02:44:23,774 --> 02:44:24,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Ranma, he's pretty awesome.

2288
02:44:25,255 --> 02:44:26,336
[SPEAKER_04]: He is.

2289
02:44:27,057 --> 02:44:29,299
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes far beyond the color of his skin.

2290
02:44:29,339 --> 02:44:30,440
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just a good character.

2291
02:44:30,500 --> 02:44:33,243
[SPEAKER_04]: And he has a fucking chocobo in his fucking afro, Ranma.

2292
02:44:34,184 --> 02:44:36,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, now one more thing before I get the fuck out of here.

2293
02:44:37,127 --> 02:44:38,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that make it a chocofro?

2294
02:44:40,650 --> 02:44:41,130
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.

2295
02:44:41,430 --> 02:44:42,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, hurry the fuck up, Ranma.

2296
02:44:42,410 --> 02:44:42,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Time's almost up.

2297
02:44:43,451 --> 02:44:47,071
[SPEAKER_18]: Can I borrow somebody's fucking Xbox 360 for the next few fucking weeks?

2298
02:44:47,091 --> 02:44:53,052
[SPEAKER_18]: Because we pre-ordered fucking FFXIII and the roommate's going to be playing it, so you know what that means.

2299
02:44:53,152 --> 02:44:58,494
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to need to get the Jaws light to get him off it, but if I try to get him off, he's going to kick my fucking ass.

2300
02:44:58,534 --> 02:45:04,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Loki might be able to let you fucking borrow one of the broken ones, but in the meantime, I think you better... Well, the broken ones aren't going to really help him.

2301
02:45:04,375 --> 02:45:05,575
[SPEAKER_04]: You better let... What the fuck?! !

2302
02:45:06,215 --> 02:45:10,238
[SPEAKER_04]: You better put a call out to the New York City OL Army, and I know there's a lot of you.

2303
02:45:10,278 --> 02:45:13,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Any fucking extra Xboxes out there, help a brother out.

2304
02:45:13,840 --> 02:45:14,661
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what's up, yo.

2305
02:45:14,801 --> 02:45:15,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2306
02:45:15,462 --> 02:45:16,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Ranma, gotta let you go.

2307
02:45:16,322 --> 02:45:16,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Time's up.

2308
02:45:16,923 --> 02:45:17,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Later, dude.

2309
02:45:17,923 --> 02:45:18,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a fucking great night.

2310
02:45:20,445 --> 02:45:24,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Ranma's gonna come hang out with me this summer, and so is... Hold on, we're on another call.

2311
02:45:24,828 --> 02:45:25,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2312
02:45:25,889 --> 02:45:26,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2313
02:45:26,229 --> 02:45:26,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the fuck show.

2314
02:45:27,750 --> 02:45:29,531
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Amiga fucking 777.

2315
02:45:30,972 --> 02:45:33,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, Amiga fucking 777.

2316
02:45:33,274 --> 02:45:34,655
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck is on your mind tonight?

2317
02:45:35,717 --> 02:45:37,778
[SPEAKER_15]: Motherfuckin' PlayStation 2.

2318
02:45:37,818 --> 02:45:39,098
[SPEAKER_15]: It's, uh, or the Dreamcast killer.

2319
02:45:39,898 --> 02:45:40,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, uh, it, it, it killed it.

2320
02:45:40,498 --> 02:45:41,438
[SPEAKER_04]: We know it killed it.

2321
02:45:42,979 --> 02:45:43,159
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh...

2322
02:46:00,990 --> 02:46:07,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Amiga, what could the Dreamcast, do you think, in retrospect, what could the Dreamcast have done to save itself?

2323
02:46:10,234 --> 02:46:13,115
[SPEAKER_15]: Gotten someone who was more skilled in marketing, I guess.

2324
02:46:14,095 --> 02:46:15,476
[SPEAKER_15]: Someone that could have said, you know...

2325
02:46:16,789 --> 02:46:24,216
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, when it comes to porting or whatnot, you know, the PlayStation 2 kind of isn't so good on this.

2326
02:46:24,296 --> 02:46:30,762
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, our port of this particular game is looking better or something like that.

2327
02:46:31,582 --> 02:46:35,286
[SPEAKER_19]: You're in no way related to the Legend of Zaku by any chance.

2328
02:46:35,920 --> 02:46:36,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you high?

2329
02:46:37,442 --> 02:46:38,103
[SPEAKER_15]: Knock it off.

2330
02:46:38,543 --> 02:46:38,863
[SPEAKER_15]: Be nice.

2331
02:46:38,903 --> 02:46:40,745
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I just got a quirky voice.

2332
02:46:41,026 --> 02:46:41,526
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all right.

2333
02:46:41,566 --> 02:46:42,968
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's cool.

2334
02:46:43,028 --> 02:46:46,892
[SPEAKER_07]: So do I. I was just going to say, though, if you were high, then you've got one of those really cool stoner voices.

2335
02:46:48,353 --> 02:46:51,277
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I seriously think there are certain people who just have really cool stoner voices.

2336
02:46:51,317 --> 02:46:51,817
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

2337
02:46:51,837 --> 02:46:52,838
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I do.

2338
02:46:52,858 --> 02:46:53,018
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.

2339
02:46:53,099 --> 02:46:53,399
[SPEAKER_11]: Mm-hmm.

2340
02:46:53,499 --> 02:46:54,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Mm-hmm.

2341
02:46:56,757 --> 02:47:02,600
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some nice games, but a lot of the good games didn't really show up until it was almost halfway to when its successor came around.

2342
02:47:20,802 --> 02:47:21,323
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

2343
02:47:21,343 --> 02:47:21,843
[SPEAKER_15]: No Fantavision?

2344
02:47:21,863 --> 02:47:22,003
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

2345
02:47:43,962 --> 02:47:44,983
[SPEAKER_15]: I love Fantavision.

2346
02:47:45,003 --> 02:47:46,744
[SPEAKER_19]: Fantavision, what the heck, man?

2347
02:47:47,724 --> 02:47:48,484
[SPEAKER_04]: It was awesome.

2348
02:47:48,745 --> 02:47:53,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Really quickly, we don't have a lot of fucking time left, but since you said you're a fan of Final Fantasy X, what do you think?

2349
02:47:53,207 --> 02:47:56,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XIII, you think you're going to be on board with that, or fuck it?

2350
02:47:57,229 --> 02:47:57,849
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, hell no.

2351
02:47:58,089 --> 02:48:03,171
[SPEAKER_15]: I am not interested in any next generation consoles.

2352
02:48:03,191 --> 02:48:10,455
[SPEAKER_15]: I have put up my wall here with the GameCube, PS2, Dreamcast, and maybe when I get another job, Xbox.

2353
02:48:12,101 --> 02:48:12,642
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

2354
02:48:13,203 --> 02:48:13,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Props to you.

2355
02:48:13,783 --> 02:48:16,166
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still a lot of great games to discover from the last generation.

2356
02:48:16,226 --> 02:48:17,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XII, really good.

2357
02:48:17,568 --> 02:48:18,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Dragon Quest VIII, really good.

2358
02:48:19,310 --> 02:48:22,834
[SPEAKER_04]: All towards the end of that cycle before the news consoles came out.

2359
02:48:23,254 --> 02:48:28,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, Amiga, gotta let you go, but just before I do, I just want to say, mod files for life.

2360
02:48:29,581 --> 02:48:30,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Amen.

2361
02:48:30,262 --> 02:48:30,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Amen to that.

2362
02:48:31,003 --> 02:48:31,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, take care, buddy.

2363
02:48:32,404 --> 02:48:32,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

2364
02:48:48,737 --> 02:48:50,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio Fuck Show.

2365
02:48:50,438 --> 02:48:52,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they hung up.

2366
02:48:52,960 --> 02:48:53,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, fuck them.

2367
02:48:53,761 --> 02:48:54,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, fuck them then.

2368
02:48:54,702 --> 02:48:58,265
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they probably were trying to redial so fast to get in that they... Yeah, here it comes again.

2369
02:48:58,865 --> 02:49:00,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio Fuck Show.

2370
02:49:00,407 --> 02:49:00,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2371
02:49:02,388 --> 02:49:03,629
[SPEAKER_10]: Yellow there, oh lord.

2372
02:49:03,649 --> 02:49:04,430
[SPEAKER_10]: This is that...

2373
02:49:05,114 --> 02:49:05,914
[SPEAKER_10]: Other Swede.

2374
02:49:06,014 --> 02:49:06,594
[SPEAKER_10]: I get it, man.

2375
02:49:07,215 --> 02:49:08,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, Other Swede.

2376
02:49:08,755 --> 02:49:09,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this.

2377
02:49:09,415 --> 02:49:14,157
[SPEAKER_04]: We should have... Like, you know how, like... And I'll credit this on your minutes.

2378
02:49:14,557 --> 02:49:17,657
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how we have the tester on PlayStation?

2379
02:49:18,098 --> 02:49:22,599
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we need to have, like, a throwdown contest on who gets to be the official OLR Swede.

2380
02:49:23,419 --> 02:49:26,800
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we might have to... I have something to say, though.

2381
02:49:28,220 --> 02:49:33,762
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel a bit stupid in the sense that, well, I've missed that call.

2382
02:49:38,388 --> 02:49:43,793
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you've heard, but we do this thing called a podcast, and you can download old episodes and listen to them whenever you want.

2383
02:49:44,134 --> 02:49:44,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

2384
02:49:56,075 --> 02:49:59,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Aki Ripper, I would love to bring the two Swedes together.

2385
02:49:59,737 --> 02:50:01,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe G... What's his name?

2386
02:50:01,278 --> 02:50:03,279
[SPEAKER_04]: GK... G-Ditz.

2387
02:50:03,399 --> 02:50:03,799
[SPEAKER_04]: G-Ditz.

2388
02:50:03,879 --> 02:50:08,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe G-Ditz will email us and let us know the next episode he'll be listening, and we can have our Swede-off.

2389
02:50:09,042 --> 02:50:09,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh!

2390
02:50:09,382 --> 02:50:10,743
[SPEAKER_04]: I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

2391
02:50:11,684 --> 02:50:14,165
[SPEAKER_04]: An old-fashioned game of OLR match game.

2392
02:50:14,305 --> 02:50:15,205
[SPEAKER_04]: We can have the Swede-off.

2393
02:50:19,861 --> 02:50:20,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's true.

2394
02:50:20,401 --> 02:50:21,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Misty has a good point.

2395
02:50:21,302 --> 02:50:22,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking brilliant.

2396
02:50:22,262 --> 02:50:24,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Ake Ripper is the original Swede.

2397
02:50:24,584 --> 02:50:27,626
[SPEAKER_04]: You do get dibs on being first, so nobody can take that away from you.

2398
02:50:30,388 --> 02:50:41,396
[SPEAKER_10]: I was calling in about apparently something I think you've already discussed on the first hour, but still.

2399
02:50:42,837 --> 02:50:44,618
[SPEAKER_10]: The new Ascent expansion!

2400
02:50:45,782 --> 02:50:47,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I fucking touched on this.

2401
02:50:47,243 --> 02:50:48,364
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, did you hit on this?

2402
02:50:48,384 --> 02:50:48,964
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think so.

2403
02:50:49,745 --> 02:50:50,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Do what?

2404
02:50:50,865 --> 02:50:52,046
[SPEAKER_04]: The newest Sims expansion.

2405
02:50:53,047 --> 02:50:55,909
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking forward to it as soon as I can get my old ones to run.

2406
02:50:58,691 --> 02:51:00,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Akira Ripper's way too excited about this.

2407
02:51:00,412 --> 02:51:01,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us about the new Sims expansion.

2408
02:51:02,253 --> 02:51:14,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the expansion is called Sims Ambition, and it was all like, uh-huh, in a kind of way, but still, it's like, yay!

2409
02:51:16,095 --> 02:51:24,978
[SPEAKER_10]: The only ambition though that they don't have in there is the ambition to be a porn star or stripper, so I'm really not interested in this expansion at all.

2410
02:51:44,662 --> 02:51:45,543
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, well, okay.

2411
02:51:45,923 --> 02:51:51,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe... My ambition is to host a crappy podcast on the internet for eight years of my life.

2412
02:51:51,486 --> 02:51:53,747
[SPEAKER_19]: Or maybe they strive to be my wall slave.

2413
02:51:54,127 --> 02:51:57,049
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, the person that I trap inside my wall of death.

2414
02:51:58,409 --> 02:51:59,430
[SPEAKER_19]: Or drown in my pool.

2415
02:52:00,030 --> 02:52:01,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have like a saw house in there?

2416
02:52:02,071 --> 02:52:04,072
[SPEAKER_19]: No, that's what I do in my Sims games.

2417
02:52:04,132 --> 02:52:09,075
[SPEAKER_19]: It's basically, you know, you create a wall or room around the people and you starve them to death.

2418
02:52:09,714 --> 02:52:16,019
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to ask Aki Ripper, time's almost up, so I got to ask Aki Ripper, anything else you want to say about The Sims or anything else before we let you go, my friend?

2419
02:52:17,800 --> 02:52:28,487
[SPEAKER_10]: I tried to play Sims 2 since last week, and I played for like a half hour, and then, no, I'm going back to Sims 3.

2420
02:52:30,229 --> 02:52:31,029
[SPEAKER_04]: At least now we know.

2421
02:52:31,049 --> 02:52:35,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, really quickly, in one word, in one word, Aki Ripper, why?

2422
02:52:38,935 --> 02:52:39,015
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh,

2423
02:52:39,841 --> 02:52:43,965
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't all like, uh, what the oof?

2424
02:52:46,308 --> 02:52:47,009
[SPEAKER_04]: That's more than one word.

2425
02:52:47,029 --> 02:52:48,570
[SPEAKER_04]: That's more than one word, but that's okay, we'll let it go.

2426
02:52:48,870 --> 02:52:50,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, HockeyRibber, take care.

2427
02:52:51,233 --> 02:52:52,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, buddy.

2428
02:52:52,414 --> 02:52:52,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

2429
02:52:53,235 --> 02:52:54,596
[SPEAKER_04]: What the oof?

2430
02:52:55,337 --> 02:52:56,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Did he say oof?

2431
02:52:56,218 --> 02:52:56,959
[SPEAKER_04]: I think was the word.

2432
02:52:58,400 --> 02:52:58,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Love it.

2433
02:53:00,399 --> 02:53:02,480
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Swedish people, I really do.

2434
02:53:03,200 --> 02:53:06,042
[SPEAKER_04]: I swear to God I've got to visit Sweden before I die at some point.

2435
02:53:06,602 --> 02:53:08,743
[SPEAKER_04]: At least when they open the ABBA museum, if nothing else.

2436
02:53:10,024 --> 02:53:16,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Mamma Mia, by the way, the big play based on ABBA songs, because the Swedish people love it whenever Sweden gets brought up by Bring Up ABBA.

2437
02:53:18,468 --> 02:53:23,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, uh, the Mamma Mia play is coming to San Jose in 2011.

2438
02:53:23,710 --> 02:53:30,873
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have a friend that works for the, um, uh, the production company that puts all this on.

2439
02:53:30,913 --> 02:53:36,595
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, hey, I really want to, um, I really want to, uh, go to this play.

2440
02:53:36,715 --> 02:53:39,876
[SPEAKER_04]: And my friend's like, why do you fucking love such a shitty show?

2441
02:53:40,957 --> 02:53:42,937
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, cause it's ABBA, shut up.

2442
02:53:44,018 --> 02:53:44,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2443
02:53:46,833 --> 02:53:49,775
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR if there's any more phone calls tonight.

2444
02:53:50,055 --> 02:53:54,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, Loki, do you have any other last minute stories for us while we wait for the phone to ring?

2445
02:53:54,039 --> 02:53:58,223
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm so disappointed that all my Oscar picks would have won and I would have probably won money.

2446
02:53:58,543 --> 02:54:06,050
[SPEAKER_19]: God, this will just teach me that I need to submit my Oscar picks when I actually do them.

2447
02:54:06,150 --> 02:54:07,391
[SPEAKER_19]: Stop being so fucking lazy.

2448
02:54:07,691 --> 02:54:08,011
[SPEAKER_19]: Whatever.

2449
02:54:33,723 --> 02:54:34,684
[SPEAKER_19]: Agent X-Link Hey, how the fuck are ya?

2450
02:55:00,589 --> 02:55:01,169
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura.com

2451
02:55:20,519 --> 02:55:21,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's kind of hard at first.

2452
02:55:21,720 --> 02:55:24,743
[SPEAKER_01]: I was drooling for the first couple of days looking like a fucking idiot.

2453
02:55:24,843 --> 02:55:28,425
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, hey, you know, you live, you learn, you do it very slowly.

2454
02:55:28,486 --> 02:55:32,469
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and it got me a lot of time to catch up on a few games and such.

2455
02:55:32,549 --> 02:55:36,652
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had a friend that had to have that done kind of young, like in the early 20s.

2456
02:55:36,752 --> 02:55:37,593
[SPEAKER_04]: So it happens.

2457
02:55:37,833 --> 02:55:37,993
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

2458
02:55:38,594 --> 02:55:38,854
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2459
02:55:39,094 --> 02:55:39,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what's on your mind tonight?

2460
02:55:39,935 --> 02:55:40,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.

2461
02:55:42,170 --> 02:55:53,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing much, you know, it's great to hear that the DRM is finally cracked so this way during hurricane season I can sit down with my laptop and play Assassin's Creed 2 and not worry about being connected onto a fucking internet feed 24-7, so...

2462
02:55:56,650 --> 02:55:56,950
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura,

2463
02:56:15,609 --> 02:56:17,650
[SPEAKER_01]: I would give PS2 nothing but love for that.

2464
02:56:17,710 --> 02:56:27,457
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, a system that doesn't break or go down for two and a half days when there's certain leafy issues with other consoles.

2465
02:56:30,418 --> 02:56:31,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

2466
02:56:31,279 --> 02:56:36,502
[SPEAKER_04]: I like, though, that we kind of get the back-to-back calls about PS2 love versus PS2 hate.

2467
02:56:36,722 --> 02:56:37,623
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of cool.

2468
02:56:37,643 --> 02:56:38,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Not hate, just, you know...

2469
02:56:39,907 --> 02:56:43,989
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, there's a shitload of games for PS2 right now I'm still going through.

2470
02:56:44,049 --> 02:56:48,771
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can't even start to sit here and tell you how many games I've got to go through for the PS2.

2471
02:56:48,831 --> 02:57:01,637
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sitting right across, I haven't even touched, or I went halfway through, and, you know, and I still have a lot of them, and I'm planning on going through them before I even consider to get a PS3 or anything like that, because, you know, that's going to be more...

2472
02:57:02,978 --> 02:57:11,226
[SPEAKER_01]: On my list, so I mean, you know, between that and my PSP and my PC games, I'm pretty much set for probably about almost a year, give or take.

2473
02:57:11,466 --> 02:57:16,230
[SPEAKER_04]: It does have one of the fucking largest libraries of video games just ever, and it's not stopping.

2474
02:57:16,371 --> 02:57:19,774
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you listen to Japanese release dates, there is still fucking shit coming out for it now.

2475
02:57:20,535 --> 02:57:24,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but unfortunately the American version, though, is slowing down, though.

2476
02:57:25,039 --> 02:57:26,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

2477
02:57:44,272 --> 02:57:51,913
[SPEAKER_19]: They actually have a Sakura Wars game that was coming out on PlayStation 2, getting the nice little collector's edition treatment to that.

2478
02:57:52,573 --> 02:57:58,234
[SPEAKER_19]: In April, there's going to be the Lord of the Rings Aragons quest, you know, Lord of the Rings for kids.

2479
02:58:00,995 --> 02:58:02,335
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's about it.

2480
02:58:02,355 --> 02:58:05,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much that's it, unless you're talking about maybe a few EA games.

2481
02:58:06,016 --> 02:58:09,016
[SPEAKER_19]: Even EA is cutting them out now for sports stuff, at least.

2482
02:58:09,436 --> 02:58:12,377
[SPEAKER_19]: Madden probably will have a PS2 version.

2483
02:58:12,888 --> 02:58:16,969
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta jump in here because X-Links three minutes are up, but quickly, do you have any other quick final thoughts for us?

2484
02:58:17,149 --> 02:58:18,569
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope, that's pretty much about it.

2485
02:58:18,709 --> 02:58:19,610
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I had to say.

2486
02:58:19,750 --> 02:58:20,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, feel better soon, buddy.

2487
02:58:20,970 --> 02:58:21,390
[SPEAKER_04]: See you on WoW.

2488
02:58:21,410 --> 02:58:22,010
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I feel better.

2489
02:58:22,030 --> 02:58:22,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

2490
02:58:22,250 --> 02:58:22,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, later.

2491
02:58:23,771 --> 02:58:25,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I think that's gonna do it for the Skyplane tonight.

2492
02:58:25,371 --> 02:58:28,212
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a lot of listeners in tonight, so thank you guys very much for the phone calls.

2493
02:58:28,432 --> 02:58:29,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Really appreciate it.

2494
02:58:29,292 --> 02:58:30,812
[SPEAKER_04]: If you didn't get through, sorry, guys.

2495
02:58:31,392 --> 02:58:33,613
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really fucking sorry, but you have to send us a fucking email.

2496
02:58:33,653 --> 02:58:38,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com I know Loki's been fucking waiting to do some last-minute fucking stories, right?

2497
02:58:38,974 --> 02:58:39,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure.

2498
02:58:39,555 --> 02:58:40,576
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

2499
02:58:40,816 --> 02:58:43,179
[SPEAKER_19]: There's some interesting information.

2500
02:58:43,999 --> 02:58:54,611
[SPEAKER_19]: Apparently, Batman Arkham Asylum is getting the Game of the Year edition, which was supposed to be coming out over in the U.S., and as far as I'm aware, still is coming out over in the U.S., unless they've already announced that they're not.

2501
02:58:55,111 --> 02:58:56,172
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2502
02:59:14,203 --> 02:59:41,766
[SPEAKER_19]: 3D that will allow you to view the game in 3D and doesn't rely on red and blue lenses meaning the colors are preserved and apparently will work with HD and standard definition sets which, you know, if that works now, I think they should that sounds like a good idea, sounds cheap speaking of good ideas coming from Warner Brothers, okay, well I'm being sarcastic here they're in talks now to produce a Space Invaders movie

2503
02:59:42,006 --> 02:59:45,528
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, the movie industry has run out of ideas.

2504
02:59:46,268 --> 02:59:48,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at least they could do whatever the fuck they wanted.

2505
02:59:48,249 --> 02:59:50,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's not like there's this big fucking plot to Space Invaders.

2506
02:59:51,471 --> 02:59:52,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Aliens are invading Earth!

2507
02:59:52,791 --> 02:59:53,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Shoot them!

2508
02:59:54,052 --> 02:59:54,332
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow.

2509
02:59:54,952 --> 03:00:04,257
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, so Space Invaders, apparently they're speculating that the film will be a big budget action blockbuster movie.

2510
03:00:04,997 --> 03:00:23,753
[SPEAKER_19]: Helm by some prolific director Sony has filed some patents for game demos apparently that will lose feature over time Which I have to say is the worst idea ever Can't you just fucking re-download it?

2511
03:00:24,814 --> 03:00:52,368
[SPEAKER_19]: well maybe you won't be able to maybe it's going to be like those time trials you know on Windows and stuff like that and why should I have to fucking re-download say if I want to show a demo I play a demo say for a game that you may not be getting a lot of press or whatever and I want to show my friends like for example Wet Wet I thought the demo was fucking awesome and I showed my friends and they got excited about it if I have to play the game again and the features are removed that's going to be pretty disappointing well it was cool the first time I played it

2512
03:00:52,668 --> 03:00:57,855
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, what you have to do is you have to make another PlayStation profile and have your friend sign in to play.

2513
03:01:00,219 --> 03:01:02,462
[SPEAKER_20]: No, not going to do that.

2514
03:01:03,853 --> 03:01:10,058
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, apparently Ubisoft is looking to take on Tony Hawk, which shouldn't be too difficult.

2515
03:01:10,799 --> 03:01:14,342
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, at this point, and they're going to put out Sean White skateboarding.

2516
03:01:14,362 --> 03:01:18,325
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, Sean White, um, apparently skateboards as well.

2517
03:01:18,826 --> 03:01:25,551
[SPEAKER_19]: And, uh, unfortunately though, in the screenshot that they have of Sean White snowboarding, looks like a Geico caveman.

2518
03:01:25,911 --> 03:01:31,976
[SPEAKER_19]: So I don't know what's going on there because he certainly doesn't look like a Geico caveman, um, normally.

2519
03:01:31,996 --> 03:01:32,037
[SPEAKER_19]: Um,

2520
03:01:33,337 --> 03:01:39,962
[SPEAKER_19]: and yes, so they're going to be releasing that game apparently and most likely on the Wii because that's where the last one came.

2521
03:01:40,682 --> 03:01:48,307
[SPEAKER_19]: Test Drive Unlimited is getting a sequel coming out apparently this fall to PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

2522
03:01:48,807 --> 03:01:56,552
[SPEAKER_19]: And apparently the sequel will also have new elements including day-night cycles, weather effects, and vehicle damage.

2523
03:01:57,693 --> 03:02:01,816
[SPEAKER_19]: And hopefully the cops will figure out how to chase you down when you drive off the road.

2524
03:02:01,836 --> 03:02:01,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2525
03:02:02,734 --> 03:02:06,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently our chatters are not big fans of my Muppet voice, which I guess is what that is.

2526
03:02:07,595 --> 03:02:07,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

2527
03:02:09,476 --> 03:02:12,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking Shaoran in chat says, so is next show the Muppet show or something?

2528
03:02:13,237 --> 03:02:14,517
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be awesome.

2529
03:02:15,777 --> 03:02:16,097
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

2530
03:02:16,678 --> 03:02:22,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, and welcome to the OLR Muppet show.

2531
03:02:22,459 --> 03:02:26,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Muppet babies.

2532
03:02:26,320 --> 03:02:27,840
[SPEAKER_04]: We had that happen a couple episodes ago.

2533
03:02:27,961 --> 03:02:29,541
[SPEAKER_19]: Ake Ripper is the Swedish chef.

2534
03:02:33,291 --> 03:02:34,492
[SPEAKER_04]: The Swedish chef is racist.

2535
03:02:36,353 --> 03:02:37,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't appreciate your racist joke.

2536
03:02:38,475 --> 03:02:38,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2537
03:02:40,916 --> 03:02:41,577
[SPEAKER_11]: Listen, frog!

2538
03:02:45,059 --> 03:02:49,102
[SPEAKER_20]: So yeah, that's... The OLR Muppet Show is all about moi.

2539
03:02:53,805 --> 03:02:55,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, I fucking made Loki shut the fuck up.

2540
03:02:55,987 --> 03:03:00,130
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I'm just rolling my eyes, and unfortunately you can't hear that on the radio.

2541
03:03:00,150 --> 03:03:00,250
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

2542
03:03:02,871 --> 03:03:06,643
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know you people.

2543
03:03:07,386 --> 03:03:07,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you do.

2544
03:03:08,168 --> 03:03:08,831
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hiding.

2545
03:03:09,571 --> 03:03:10,492
[SPEAKER_04]: You're my BFF.

2546
03:03:10,632 --> 03:03:10,952
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2547
03:03:11,392 --> 03:03:12,233
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, Rob.

2548
03:03:12,493 --> 03:03:18,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts tonight because believe it or not, we're at the end of the fucking show.

2549
03:03:18,237 --> 03:03:19,758
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you enjoyed your fucking selves tonight.

2550
03:03:20,639 --> 03:03:23,300
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a pretty fucking good time and I'm sure we said the F word a lot.

2551
03:03:23,801 --> 03:03:25,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we'll get a count after the podcast goes out.

2552
03:03:25,802 --> 03:03:26,463
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't fucking know.

2553
03:03:26,903 --> 03:03:27,323
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

2554
03:03:27,503 --> 03:03:29,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't put a lot of fucking effort into it, unfortunately.

2555
03:03:29,445 --> 03:03:29,805
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

2556
03:03:29,825 --> 03:03:31,526
[SPEAKER_04]: At the beginning of the show, I had a lot more fucks in the end.

2557
03:03:31,546 --> 03:03:31,766
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a...

2558
03:03:33,007 --> 03:03:34,088
[SPEAKER_04]: You get tired after a while.

2559
03:03:58,984 --> 03:04:00,645
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't just have to fucking be on iTunes, though.

2560
03:04:00,665 --> 03:04:02,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Just tell a fucking friend, you know, in real life.

2561
03:04:02,607 --> 03:04:03,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Project Real Life, right?

2562
03:04:04,028 --> 03:04:06,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell some fucking friends what you heard on Orange Launch fucking radio.

2563
03:04:07,190 --> 03:04:09,331
[SPEAKER_04]: And tell friends to listen to shows.

2564
03:04:09,351 --> 03:04:12,834
[SPEAKER_04]: But you might want to not have them fucking start with this episode.

2565
03:04:13,314 --> 03:04:15,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, this should be, like, maybe the fourth episode you listen to.

2566
03:04:16,036 --> 03:04:17,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't have this be somebody's fucking first episode.

2567
03:04:17,917 --> 03:04:18,958
[SPEAKER_04]: But just tell your fucking friends.

2568
03:04:19,018 --> 03:04:19,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Word of mouth.

2569
03:04:19,518 --> 03:04:21,960
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all we fucking got because we're an independent fucking podcast.

2570
03:04:22,480 --> 03:04:22,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw, yeah.

2571
03:04:24,541 --> 03:04:24,882
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

2572
03:04:24,922 --> 03:04:26,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go around and get everybody's fucking final thought tonight.

2573
03:04:26,983 --> 03:04:28,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Sakura, what's your fucking final thought?

2574
03:04:30,927 --> 03:04:31,227
Fuck.

2575
03:04:32,329 --> 03:04:33,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your fucking final thought tonight.

2576
03:04:34,612 --> 03:04:38,036
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll have to see where this thing goes with this guy ripping me off.

2577
03:04:39,879 --> 03:04:40,760
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

2578
03:04:42,662 --> 03:04:45,366
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very annoying.

2579
03:04:46,969 --> 03:04:50,411
[SPEAKER_04]: And my fucking final thought tonight is Sassafras.

2580
03:04:51,492 --> 03:04:52,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Good night, everybody.

2581
