00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,160
Today, March 21, 2010, the Xbox 360 is set to get USB storage, GameStop test perks for

2
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:29,920
loyal customers, and what Playstation 3 add-on is selling out in Japan.

3
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:37,240
Hello, my friends, and welcome to episode number 360 of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,360
I'm having trouble speaking tonight.

5
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,680
This bodes well for tonight's show.

6
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,780
The video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,680
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host,

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,120
not here right now, but will be here a little later, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,120
Summers.

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,280
She's at another commitment right now, but she'll be here about 7, 7.30-ish Pacific time,

11
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,480
depending on when that is all over.

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,040
But never fear, I am joined by the one and only tech master, Loki.

13
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,040
Hello.

14
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,040
How are you doing tonight, Loki?

15
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,040
Doing fine.

16
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,040
Good.

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,040
At least he has chicken.

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,040
Once again, I noticed he stopped by KFC tonight.

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,040
Yeah, I don't know.

20
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,040
It sounded good again.

21
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,040
All right.

22
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,040
That's fine.

23
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,440
Also joining us tonight, we have a special guest.

24
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,200
He was here a couple of weeks ago, and he decided to come on back.

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,440
It is Salacious Pop, or Alan.

26
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,440
Hello.

27
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,440
How are you?

28
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,440
I'm good.

29
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,440
Yeah?

30
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,440
Yes, I'm going to try and talk a little bit more tonight.

31
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,960
You're going to try and talk more tonight.

32
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,600
Good, because you have to fill in for Dark Sakura because she's out.

33
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,480
But remember, those mics, not very sensitive.

34
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,480
So keep it.

35
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,480
Yeah.

36
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,480
A little stage fright last time I was on.

37
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,480
That's all right.

38
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,480
Tonight, you're going to be extra sassy.

39
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,480
Yeah, I hope so.

40
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,080
You're going to be our sassy gay friend on the show tonight.

41
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,080
A stupid bitch.

42
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,640
Have you seen those YouTubes?

43
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,640
Yes.

44
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,640
You didn't find them funny.

45
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,640
I'm not a fan.

46
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,640
Why not?

47
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,640
They're funny.

48
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,640
I don't know.

49
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,640
You're not a fan of the sassy gay friend?

50
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,640
Not their fan on Facebook?

51
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,640
Fine.

52
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,640
I think they're funny.

53
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,640
All right.

54
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,640
Forget it.

55
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:00,320
No, we tape live every week, of course, at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

56
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,240
It's 6 p.m. Pacific, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

57
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,960
If you're listening to us live, pull up a chair and join us in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com,

58
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,560
where we have the first comment tonight from Black Wolf, of course, our good pal who does

59
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,440
the show before us here at All Games, saying in our chat room, Sky broke into Dark Sakura's

60
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,440
house.

61
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,320
And X-Link follows that up with, Loki picked the lock.

62
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,880
No, Dan is here, folks.

63
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,440
Dan, the man let us in.

64
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,280
I didn't come until way later.

65
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,080
He's in the gaming vault right now, and I don't know what he's playing, but he's playing.

66
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,320
He was playing Otomedius Gorgeous.

67
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,320
Ah.

68
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,240
I sold my Japanese 360.

69
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,680
Oh, very cool.

70
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,680
Okay.

71
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,640
Yeah, I wondered why you brought a 360 to the show tonight, and I thought it might be

72
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,280
because this is episode number 360, and I was like, oh, are we going to take one apart

73
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,280
live on air?

74
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,560
And I was like, well, that's going to be shitty radio.

75
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,560
Could do that.

76
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,560
I have to.

77
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,560
Yeah.

78
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,560
It's not very exciting, but you could do that.

79
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,240
Yeah, especially when it's a radio show, it's more exciting to hear you bitch about the

80
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,240
guy that stole your 360.

81
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,240
How's that going, by the way?

82
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,240
The cops ever do anything about that?

83
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,240
No, not yet.

84
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,240
Sorry to hear it.

85
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,240
Bastards.

86
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,240
All right.

87
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,880
Well, we always start off the show with a little bit of how was your gaming week.

88
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,360
So tonight we'll start with Loki, usually ladies first.

89
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,360
But since there are no ladies, Loki will have to be our lady tonight.

90
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,760
I will not be your lady tonight.

91
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,760
That's okay.

92
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,760
Loki, how was your gaming week?

93
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,560
Very uneventful, actually, because I don't know what I was playing this week, but not

94
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,400
a lot of new things, I guess.

95
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,320
More Grand Theft Auto as usual.

96
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:32,080
Still not enough Grand Theft Auto, I think, because I find myself kind of in a flux as

97
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,200
far as going up the leaderboards, just because other people are playing it more than I am.

98
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,240
So I go up a lot and then I come back down.

99
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,520
And I go up a lot and come back down, because other people are playing it and getting ahead

100
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,520
of me.

101
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,000
So that's not a big deal.

102
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
My TrueSkill stuff, though, I occasionally lose a game to my co-workers.

103
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,520
And unfortunately, the level I'm at now, I'm so high that it knocks me down quite a bit

104
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,560
for just losing a game by like a few bucks.

105
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,120
Thankfully, though, I'm not going to allow that to happen anymore.

106
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,520
And so it's going pretty well.

107
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,640
I think I'm like ranked 75 now or something like that in TrueSkill, which is not bad.

108
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,560
This week, though, I am looking forward to being able to hopefully play against some

109
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,400
of the Rockstar employees, because I know they're going to be doing their event on Tuesday

110
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,280
during, like, I think it goes from 1 to 4 Eastern.

111
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,760
I'm not positive, but I think that's time frame.

112
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,760
Maybe, no, 4 to 7 Eastern, that's right.

113
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,600
Won the 4 my time.

114
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,800
So I'm looking forward to playing some of them.

115
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,360
And then other than Grand Theft Auto, I played more Final Fantasy XIII.

116
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,160
I finally made it to the second disc, now at Palimporum.

117
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:51,480
And weren't those, like, character names from, like, Final Fantasy II or something like that?

118
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:56,480
It's Palim and Porum, but the way they spell it in XIII is a little different.

119
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,360
But I kind of am convinced it is a nod a little bit to Final Fantasy IV.

120
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,080
Because I was like, hey, that's a name from something else.

121
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,440
And what is up with Cid being bad?

122
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,960
I mean, first off, Cid doesn't look like Cid.

123
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,200
OMG, spoilers!

124
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,680
There's supposed to be a six month moratorium on spoilers, remember?

125
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,600
Well, everybody knows that Cid doesn't look like Cid because they had pictures out there already.

126
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,160
Fine.

127
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,760
I figured that out.

128
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,320
Fine.

129
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,920
And, you know, and he may be evil, he may not be evil.

130
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,880
He still has an airship thing, some sort of ship.

131
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,000
But it's, like, emo Cid.

132
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,560
Wasn't Cid bad in XII?

133
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,480
I never played XII.

134
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,600
I can't remember.

135
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,920
I want to say I read, I didn't get far enough, honestly, but I want to say I read somewhere that he was bad.

136
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,000
XII.

137
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,160
And I know Cid never looks like Cid, but come on, man.

138
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,880
I mean, it's a stretch right now.

139
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,360
Whatever.

140
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,280
And then, what else?

141
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,400
So, yeah, it's kind of moving along.

142
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:02,240
And, you know, I'm to the point now where I'm just running past a lot of the battles because I just don't want to fight them anymore.

143
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,720
I just keep going.

144
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,600
Well, you can do that because you cheated.

145
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:12,080
You're a cheating cheater, and you put in some code that gives you the 99,000 damage every time you strike.

146
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,480
And the first thing Loki bitches about when he gets to your studio, I don't know why the game won't give me the trophy, because you're a cheater.

147
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,520
Cheaters don't win.

148
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,480
Well, I'll play it again, but I just won't cheat that way.

149
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,200
I'll do something else.

150
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,760
Yeah, right.

151
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,040
I think you're going to be like, oh, my arcade cabinet, or oh, Grand Theft Auto IV.

152
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,440
Speaking of cheating, though, that reminds me, I played more Borderlands this week.

153
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:38,720
I finally loaded up the new expansion a little bit, just because I'm trying to raise my level cap again.

154
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:49,600
And then we played a little bit of the zombie island of Dr. Ned, and that was kind of fun.

155
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,320
Of course, everything's level 30 right now, we're level 50, so it's quite easy.

156
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:00,120
But it's neat popping heads off of zombies and taking their brains.

157
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,000
And then, yeah, that's pretty much it, I think.

158
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,200
All righty.

159
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,920
Alan, how was your gaming week?

160
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,120
What kind of stuff you played this week?

161
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,360
Pretty good.

162
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,560
Played some Robot Unicorn Attack.

163
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,960
Was that inspired by OLR?

164
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,840
Yeah, kind of, yeah.

165
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:25,160
Lots of WoW, World of Warcraft, and oddly enough, a lot of Bejeweled and Peggle within World of Warcraft, so kind of meta.

166
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,360
Some Warcraft III, actually, going back to 2002.

167
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,200
Picking it old school in Warcraft III.

168
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,200
Blizzard just updated a patch for Warcraft III to fix some exploits.

169
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,520
Why now? I mean, it's so far out, it's like, why bother?

170
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,320
They're awesome and they support their games forever.

171
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,200
How long have the exploits been available?

172
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,600
Like, were the exploits just found a couple months ago or something?

173
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:53,800
I think they're just from the previous patch from a year ago, and I guess they're really obscure.

174
00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:00,560
But yeah, there's so much lore in World of Warcraft that I just launched three to play a few missions from that for nostalgia.

175
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,840
So that's about it.

176
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,520
That's it for your gaming week?

177
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,840
Well, we played a bunch of games this morning.

178
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,160
You're going to let me talk about it, huh?

179
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,560
That's all right. I don't get into it.

180
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,400
You feel free to chime in, but I want to go to our chat room, chat.orangelauncher.com.

181
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,480
LiquidParrot says, I remember taking down Sky's high score in Bejeweled on Facebook by cheating.

182
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,080
Needless to say, it was frowned upon.

183
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,360
Yes, because cheating cheaters are rude.

184
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,280
Especially in multiplayer environments.

185
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,240
Like, I don't care that, I don't really care that Loki cheats on Final Fantasy 13.

186
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,040
Like, if he wants to ruin the game for himself by doing that, fine.

187
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,720
Have fun. I don't care.

188
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,680
Okay, but...

189
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,440
I've turned it into a more casual game.

190
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,560
Now I don't have to waste my time.

191
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,840
No, and you have managed to make it be nothing but cutscenes of Final Fantasy 13.

192
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,120
It's all it is anyway!

193
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,040
I was going to say, you took the...

194
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,080
You managed to take what little game there actually was out of Final Fantasy 13.

195
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,600
You're like, Odin battle? Ha!

196
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,720
Actually, the Odin battles, or the, um...

197
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,960
The battles against the summons are actually difficult still, because you have to do combo damage to them,

198
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,920
not necessarily damage damage to them.

199
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,560
So, it's still as difficult as it would normally be.

200
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,880
Everything else, so...

201
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,080
Right through it.

202
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,200
It's like, oh no, this monster's gonna be really hard.

203
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,080
Tap.

204
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,520
Okay, that's done. Thank god.

205
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,040
I don't wanna have to sit here for fifteen minutes.

206
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,840
Alright.

207
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,920
Uh, as long as...

208
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,520
Like, how long did it take you to get to that part in the game?

209
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,720
I'm only six hours in.

210
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,200
And that's how far...

211
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,320
Wait, and you're at Palimporum?

212
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:23,840
Yeah.

213
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,360
And you're six hours in?

214
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:24,760
Six.

215
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,400
I'm just about where you are, and I'm probably...

216
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,480
It probably took me about fourteen hours to get there.

217
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,160
I think I spent about the last couple hours in Palimporum.

218
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,000
See, that's how quick that, you know...

219
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,800
Oddly enough, I didn't play Final Fantasy 13 at all this week.

220
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,320
I've just been distracted with...

221
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,640
I don't know how many of you heard the call on Bobby's show tonight,

222
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,040
but I have a lot going on in my personal life.

223
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,400
Like, I'm gonna be changing my day job in the next couple weeks, which is big.

224
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,120
And then, you know, I just moved recently.

225
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,280
So, and then, you know, Boston's coming up too,

226
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,360
which, honestly, I haven't given as much thought to, but that is definitely on my mind.

227
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,120
So, I haven't had as much gaming time until the weekend,

228
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,800
when Alan and I just played a crapload of stuff this weekend.

229
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,400
So, sadly, I haven't really been in Final Fantasy 13.

230
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,080
And some folks in chat kinda arguing about the Odin battle.

231
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,000
I lost the first time, and then once I did the Libra...

232
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,680
And Alan can vouch for this, because he was there.

233
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,800
I did the Libra and read that he was weak to chain attacks, and I was like,

234
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,200
oh, just use a Ravage Ravage in your party.

235
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,080
Easy.

236
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,440
Well, they're all weak to chain attacks.

237
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,520
Well, him especially.

238
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,840
It said something like, I don't know, but for some reason that just worked.

239
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,400
Like, you just keep switching between Ravage and Medic.

240
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,360
And that's not really a spoiler, because the one thing I think a lot of people,

241
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,800
when they're first getting into Final Fantasy 13, sometimes forget,

242
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,240
and I'll just kinda put this pro tip out there, and then I'll get into other games this week.

243
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,640
Keep in mind when you're trying to fill a stagger bar.

244
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,360
Ravagers increase that bar quickly.

245
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,320
Commandos maintain it.

246
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,040
So, if you are trying to get, like, especially, like,

247
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,560
if you're in the part where you're fighting, like, the Metal Armadillos,

248
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,440
or whatever, that takes forever to kill,

249
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,640
remember that you can use a team of all Ravagers.

250
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,160
You just need to paradigm shift over and get a Commando in there once in a while

251
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,200
to make sure the bar doesn't drop too fast.

252
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,560
But then you can switch right back to Ravagers.

253
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,640
So, learning kind of the difference between the Commando and the Ravager is key.

254
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,440
Because honestly, their attacks, about the same amount of damage.

255
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,720
The Synergist is like a Red Mage.

256
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,640
Yeah, and your Synergist is a Red Mage, basically.

257
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,960
And, but Hope and Saws are completely different types of Synergists,

258
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,960
which is interesting.

259
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,600
Anyhow, I don't want to get too much into FongSC-13 spoilers,

260
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,360
because I know there's people that haven't even touched it yet,

261
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,400
but I'm trying very hard not to give story spoilers.

262
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,760
There's still that one little revelation I picked up on last week

263
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,760
that I'm like, I really want to find out if that's for real,

264
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,640
what I'm thinking, or if I'm just making shit up in my head.

265
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,040
There's another little twist that you figure out later on.

266
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,800
I like how the way they kind of addressed it, you know,

267
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,360
because you're like, way a second,

268
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,680
what's that person doing in that cutscene?

269
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,960
You know, that type of thing.

270
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,520
I, you will see, we'll see.

271
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,960
Ionotropic in chat wants to know,

272
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,720
how do you read the info after using Libra?

273
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,320
I hit the R1 button.

274
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,120
That's on PS3, I imagine.

275
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,440
It's the right shoulder button.

276
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,280
360, it's the trigger of the shoulder, yeah.

277
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,280
It's the slow button.

278
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,960
OK, other stuff I've actually been playing this week.

279
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,800
Quite a bit, thanks to The Weeknd and Alan being here.

280
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,960
OK, the one I know people in chat want me to talk about,

281
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,960
we had just a spur of the moment, impromptu battle

282
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,960
with Undersedation Live last night in Perfect Dark.

283
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,120
So the Saturday night show on all games,

284
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,400
Undersedation Live, Travis and Breslull,

285
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,280
it was their off week,

286
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,520
because they're bi-weekly right now,

287
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,800
or what is it, no, bi-monthly is when you're every other week

288
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,440
because they have Sakura Con on the horizon

289
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,800
and John's really busy.

290
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,560
So they're only every other week right now.

291
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,640
So this was their off week.

292
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,560
So they were on Perfect Dark last night really late.

293
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,280
And I kept getting all these messages,

294
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,480
like we signed on to play something else.

295
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,400
What were we playing last night on 360?

296
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,240
I don't remember, we started to play something else,

297
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,720
Rock Band, I think,

298
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,840
because we were gonna do the Gaga Pack and Rock Band.

299
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,440
So we started to get in and do that.

300
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,920
And then we get this message from John that was like,

301
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,760
dude, come play Perfect Dark with us.

302
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,320
And here's the thing that I have to admit,

303
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,040
like I know this is gonna surprise a lot of people,

304
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,040
but I never played Perfect Dark on the Nintendo 64.

305
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,640
Anyone know something else?

306
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,640
I never played Goldeneye either.

307
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,480
Like I watched people play it, but I never played it.

308
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,600
Don't judge me, OK?

309
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,440
There was other shooter games I played.

310
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,840
I played Doom, I played Quake, I played Duke Nukem.

311
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,880
I just never got around to playing Goldeneye

312
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,080
because I didn't get a 64 until really late in the game.

313
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,680
And by that point I just kind of bought it

314
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,920
from Mario Party and Pokemon Snap.

315
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,760
Don't judge me!

316
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,840
So somehow I never played Perfect Dark.

317
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,200
So, but they were like, you gotta get it, you gotta get it.

318
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,200
And I played the demo earlier in the day

319
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,000
before Alan showed up and I was kind of like, OK,

320
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,240
well, I don't know, I don't really get this.

321
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,200
Like I see how it's Nintendo 64

322
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,760
and it definitely looks like they put a lot of work

323
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,680
into the overhaul of this, but I don't know.

324
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,040
I just, I don't really get this, whatever.

325
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,080
But I'm like, it wasn't bad.

326
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,120
It was just, you know, I just,

327
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,320
I think this would mean more if I held in my memories.

328
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:57,520
So I finally, he berates me with a message.

329
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,360
Travis sends me a text message going,

330
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,800
you pussy, play Perfect Dark with us.

331
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,200
And then Misty's getting in on it.

332
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,480
Like people, just everybody's just berating me.

333
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,880
So I'm like, fine!

334
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,800
I will fucking come play Perfect Dark with you

335
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,480
and shoot you on the face.

336
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,360
So luckily enough, the Perfect Dark multiplayer

337
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,520
is cool enough where both Alan and I

338
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,520
could sign into our respective Xbox accounts

339
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,000
on the same console and play like the split screen.

340
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,160
And we were in a match.

341
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,160
So in the match was Travis, John, Misty, myself, Alan,

342
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,880
that Nick guy who I haven't talked to, but he was there.

343
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,840
Matt joined us for later matches.

344
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,680
And was that it?

345
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,880
It was like seven of us.

346
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,600
And so after Matt joins, he hooks up his soundboard

347
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,080
and he's playing like all these Duke Nukem sounds

348
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:45,000
through my speaker, like, oh yeah, and all these things.

349
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,640
Like, I'm just like, God damn it.

350
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,280
Everybody's laughing so hard,

351
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,200
partially because I think most of them were drunk.

352
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,600
Like I think John and Nick were drunk.

353
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,680
I don't know.

354
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,880
But so we had fun and I was running around.

355
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,200
Like I didn't know what I was doing, but I figured it out.

356
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,040
Like at first I was like, why can't I jump?

357
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,080
And I'm like, oh, that's right.

358
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,920
It's Perfect Dark.

359
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,440
You can't jump at Perfect Dark.

360
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,960
And I can't hate on it because you can't really jump in.

361
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,080
No, you could jump in Quake.

362
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,680
Could you jump in Doom?

363
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,880
No, you couldn't jump in Doom.

364
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,120
So, okay.

365
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,480
So I'm just like, okay, I have to approach this like Doom,

366
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,760
but you can and I figured out you can walk in the ladders

367
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,000
and go up ladders that way.

368
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,320
Like I figured that out after a few minutes.

369
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,960
And it was cool cause I got to like punch John

370
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,360
in the face a couple of times and it was fun.

371
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,200
It was fun.

372
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,960
And then there was this weird like clipping thing

373
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,520
that happened where somehow I ended up below Alan

374
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,040
whose character was on top of me

375
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,720
and I was punching him in the vagina repeatedly.

376
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,400
Cause I had no gun.

377
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,800
So it was like, I was just punching him in the skirt region.

378
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,640
And did I kill you?

379
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,480
I don't know.

380
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,080
I think, I think finally you like thought to look down

381
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,920
and shoot me in the head.

382
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,760
Yeah.

383
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,580
And I died.

384
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,420
It was sad.

385
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,280
So, but Perfect Dark was fun.

386
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,720
We had a blast playing that last night, actually.

387
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,880
It was, it was $10 well spent.

388
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,960
So I understand why people are all excited

389
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,480
cause it's, it's, it's a good multiplayer game.

390
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,560
Like everybody was having fun.

391
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,040
I felt bad for Alan

392
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,840
cause I only have the one wireless headset.

393
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,760
So I had that on.

394
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,040
And even though I had the mode on where you can, you know,

395
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,760
on your 360, you can do headphone and speakers.

396
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,480
You can't hear shit through the speakers.

397
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,300
You can't.

398
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,140
Like I think Alan,

399
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,160
could you hear anything at all coming through the speakers?

400
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,400
Yeah. Well the,

401
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,000
them talking through the TV speakers

402
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,320
along with the game effects, not really.

403
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,720
Like you can kind of tell people are talking,

404
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,680
but I had no idea what was going on.

405
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,000
And Matt's in chat right now going,

406
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,600
although Rob used his boyfriend as a decoy several times.

407
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,680
Well, what we thought to do later on is we were like,

408
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,500
is that you?

409
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,340
Yeah. Is that you?

410
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,040
Okay. Let's walk around together and try to find John.

411
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,800
And it's and assault him that way.

412
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,160
But that, that didn't work out very well.

413
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,720
Well, I was running around unarmed

414
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,940
just so that people could shoot me.

415
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,120
So I wasn't really playing for real,

416
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,480
which is really sort of shitty.

417
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,680
Oh, sure. Sure.

418
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,400
Well, I had zero kills the last two matches.

419
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,960
You were letting us win Alan.

420
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,780
Of course.

421
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,480
I was just running around being stupid.

422
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,280
I don't like first person shooters on consoles.

423
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,080
I'll bring in my other wireless communicator.

424
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,660
Cause I have one of those.

425
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:03,200
We, I brought it into our game room area at work

426
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,360
so that we could talk to people

427
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,120
and berate them if we wanted to.

428
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,880
But instead my coworker decides to go ahead

429
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,040
and take it and say, I'm Loki.

430
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,320
I'm stupid.

431
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,920
I'm like, okay, you're not having that anymore.

432
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,760
Nice.

433
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,560
I love you such and such player.

434
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,160
It sounds very dark.

435
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,600
I'm like damn you.

436
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,440
Nice.

437
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,040
Oh, I'm sorry.

438
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,120
You hate first person shooters on consoles.

439
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,880
Yeah. So I can do it,

440
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,680
but I'm more of a stickler for the mouse and keyboard.

441
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,520
So I was being stubborn.

442
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,360
I was being stubborn.

443
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,180
That's right.

444
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,460
Because you're like a half-life geek.

445
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,840
That's something I have to remember.

446
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,960
You like half-life is like God to you, right?

447
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,800
Yes.

448
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,560
Okay. So all this other stuff is crap.

449
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,640
All right.

450
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,480
But have you ever played the orange box on 360

451
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,400
or is that like sacrilege to you?

452
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,880
I downloaded the demo for it,

453
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,040
which is the beginning of half-life episode two on the 360,

454
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,440
just to, you know, played it for about half hour.

455
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,280
Decided I didn't like the controls.

456
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,200
Okay. So you're one of those PC elitists.

457
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,040
That's fine.

458
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,920
That's cool.

459
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,960
All right. So other gaming week.

460
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,080
So then we played rock band.

461
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,600
We finally got around to playing the Gaga songs

462
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,440
in a rock band.

463
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,960
And I'll say this cause I sent it to Bobby on his show.

464
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,000
Cause he was talking about how he bought

465
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,160
the Eric Cartman poker face.

466
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,880
That poker face Cartman thing is the kind of thing

467
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,680
that's like funny once.

468
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,880
Like I couldn't see myself playing that song over

469
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,720
and over again.

470
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,680
Cause I liked the song.

471
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,160
Like it's funny once,

472
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,880
but if you have a lot of people that come to your house

473
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,920
to play rock band, like you throw the rock band parties,

474
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,400
it's, you know, it's going to,

475
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,880
somebody inevitably is going to pull that song up

476
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,160
at a party and go, I want to sing the Cartman poker face.

477
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,200
Ah ha ha ha.

478
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,560
But we played it once and we were like, ha ha next.

479
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,760
Well, you can at least do like a South Park medley

480
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,640
at least now cause you've got a couple songs.

481
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,480
Timmy, right?

482
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,320
Yeah.

483
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,400
And then we, then we squealed

484
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,840
cause we were able to play bad romance.

485
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,680
Let's see.

486
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,840
Ah, then what else today?

487
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,480
Okay. So today, what did we do?

488
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,800
We fired up the 360 and I don't know,

489
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,240
do we have intention on playing anything?

490
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,080
I think we were like,

491
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,800
let's find something co-op that we can both play.

492
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,640
Yeah. Right.

493
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,960
So I'm looking through my game collection

494
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,040
and we get to beautiful Katamari and I'm like,

495
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,880
you know what?

496
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,040
I didn't play this game that much

497
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,080
cause I didn't really like it,

498
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,120
but I hear it has co-op and versus.

499
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,940
So let's try that.

500
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,720
Cause maybe that'll make the game more fun.

501
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,100
So we pop it in and by the way,

502
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,120
I don't have a second PS3 controller.

503
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,880
So we had to do 360 today.

504
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,960
So just so you know.

505
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,760
So we put in beautiful Katamari and I'm like,

506
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,000
okay, let's do co-op mode.

507
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,240
And I was kind of surprised.

508
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,020
Oh, it's not split screen.

509
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,540
Oh, we're controlling the same Katamari.

510
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,840
So Alan and I are trying to play

511
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,960
and we just keep rolling the Katamari in a giant circle.

512
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,800
Like, and there's nothing on the screen to tell you

513
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,700
like so-and-so is tilting the wrong way.

514
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,160
It's just, it was bad.

515
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,400
Like there was nothing to do.

516
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,600
It just splits the twin stick controls

517
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,860
between the two people.

518
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,600
And it's, yeah, I wasn't feeling it at all.

519
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,440
No, it was terrible.

520
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,960
After like 30 seconds, Alan was like,

521
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,480
turn it off, turn it off.

522
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,960
So he decided to do versus.

523
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,800
Cause it's like, okay,

524
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,360
I've seen a picture of a split screen

525
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,460
on the back of the box.

526
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:06,160
I know this has to have like a two player true mode in it.

527
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,560
Sure enough versus is split screen.

528
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,120
And when we were going to the stage select,

529
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,040
we're like, oh, home.

530
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,880
I'm like, okay, cool.

531
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,760
It's going to be like, who can make the biggest Katamari?

532
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,580
This will be fun.

533
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,180
Okay, now this will be great.

534
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,960
No, the battle was roll up the most clothes pins

535
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,720
in one minute, go.

536
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,960
And it's like this generically square playing field

537
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,880
with a bunch of clothes pins.

538
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,560
And it was roll up as many as you can.

539
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,640
And he tried to crash into the other Katamari once in a

540
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,160
while and make them lose clothes pins.

541
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,680
And so we play that and I was like, this is not fun.

542
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,620
So we decided to play the world.

543
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,480
I'm like, okay, let's do the hardest stage

544
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,600
and see what it is.

545
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,040
So it was now you're in a much bigger square playing field

546
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,320
and you're going to roll up houses.

547
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,600
And I was like, this is shit.

548
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,720
Like I think I literally said after it was over

549
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,160
and it's not just because Alan beat me,

550
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,200
but I was like, this is shit.

551
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,200
And I threw my controller down.

552
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,080
It was shit.

553
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,060
It was not fun.

554
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,640
Like a versus Katamari game should be so much better.

555
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,800
I don't know if they got it right on PS3.

556
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,320
You know, I, even in the single player mode,

557
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,400
the PS3 is the better game than the 360.

558
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,780
And that has nothing to do with the consoles themselves.

559
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,600
Don't start the console wars with me.

560
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,120
It's just that for what, you know,

561
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,400
beautiful Katamari came first and they made mistakes.

562
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,200
So maybe they fixed them with the PS3 one.

563
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,320
I don't know, but the PS3 Katamari forever

564
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,060
or whatever is superior to the 360 one.

565
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,800
Now I haven't even played the co-op or versus.

566
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:29,200
So after that was terrible, we decided to go into arcade.

567
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,660
And we were just kind of looking through arcade games

568
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,720
to play and I was like, okay, Alan, what do you want to play?

569
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,040
Like, what don't you have yourself?

570
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,720
And he's like, oh, you have double dragon.

571
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,560
Let's play that.

572
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,400
I'm like, okay.

573
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,200
Like I think I played this for like five seconds

574
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,040
when I first downloaded it back when I would just

575
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,260
download arcade games to download them.

576
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,400
Like you saw how many arcade games I have on 360, right?

577
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,920
It's and then you cry thinking of all the starving children

578
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,720
that I could have fed with that money, yeah.

579
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,720
So we go into play double dragon and I don't know, Alan,

580
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,680
can you, it's.

581
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,960
That game does not stand to the test of time.

582
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,680
That game is terrible.

583
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,220
It's terrible.

584
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,720
I feel bad for all of the $5 bills

585
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,360
that I extorted from my mother and grandmother.

586
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,680
This game's really hard at the, you know,

587
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,080
at the arcade little nine year old me playing a bad game.

588
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,940
It's awful.

589
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,000
It's one of those games I think we really see

590
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,200
through rose colored glasses or whatever they call it.

591
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,800
Like remember better from our childhood.

592
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,360
Like I, and I don't know if it's just the 360 port

593
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,400
or whatever, but there's fricking slow down and flickering

594
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,880
and the game is just fucking cheap.

595
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,100
Like, like don't press down too much.

596
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,640
You're going to fall off the edge.

597
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,040
And it's like this horrible collision detection in the game

598
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,560
and then finally, when we got to the end,

599
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,940
we had to battle each other to see who got

600
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,660
the big titty girl and it was like the worst fight

601
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,320
in the entire world that we did.

602
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,960
And finally I somehow won, even though Alan hit me

603
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,880
with a baseball bat like 50 times,

604
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,340
all I did was I had to pull his hair a few times and I won.

605
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,580
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that the three punches

606
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,840
does way more damage than the baseball bat

607
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,280
because I hit you about eight times.

608
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,760
Yeah, so we played our way through double dragon

609
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,640
and we were like, what the hell are we thinking as children?

610
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,180
This game was better, it was better on the NES, honestly.

611
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,180
I would rather play the NES version of double dragon

612
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,760
than the 360 version and that's awesome.

613
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,680
The NES version was awesome.

614
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,480
Yeah, although now I'm worried.

615
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,480
I'm like, God, I wonder if I'm just remembering

616
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,640
that one more fondly than I deserve to or what.

617
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,000
No, it's just like Contra, like Contra on the arcade.

618
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,860
I didn't really care for it, but on the NES it was cool.

619
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,400
Vidpower in chat says 50,000,

620
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,000
you scored 50,000 points on double dragon

621
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,840
from the movie The Wizard.

622
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,640
Dude, if you can score like 50,000 points on double dragon,

623
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,160
that actually is really impressive.

624
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,560
Like I have a lot of respect for a gamer that can do that

625
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,520
now after seeing how fucking cheap that game is.

626
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,200
Like I kid you not, the last boss will shoot you

627
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,500
in the back with a gun and you will die instantly.

628
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,360
Insert quarter to continue.

629
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,700
Like what the hell, no wonder they removed that game

630
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,100
from Xbox Live Marketplace, it was bad.

631
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,560
So then I said to Alan, I was like, well fuck it,

632
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,720
let's just make it a bad game day.

633
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,760
And so that's when I reached for Fusion Frenzy 2.

634
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,560
Yes, the game I spent $60 on when it first came out,

635
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,220
I decided to pop it in because I'm like, Alan, no,

636
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,540
you have to see how fucking terrible this game is.

637
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,640
So we played like what, for, which by the way,

638
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,840
if you've never played Fusion Frenzy 2,

639
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,440
it's kind of like Xbox's answer to Mario Party,

640
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,040
but with a more like science fiction future theme.

641
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,320
So we flew to the planet Moisture to do some battle

642
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,160
in some water.

643
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,020
No one should ever fly to the planet Moisture.

644
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,480
To do some battle in some water themed stages.

645
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,940
And Alan, what were your thoughts on Fusion Frenzy 2?

646
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,380
It was emotional abuse and I'm upset

647
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,980
and I need to call a shelter.

648
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,260
Gamer's spouse abuse.

649
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,520
What was so bad about it?

650
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,200
Just the host was in like his pink jumpsuit

651
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,960
with the spiky hair and you could tell that it was sort of,

652
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,920
you know, edgy, like designed by committee.

653
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,160
And it was really just sort of the showgirls of party games,

654
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,000
but without any of the breasts or anything

655
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,360
that makes showgirls great.

656
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,400
It was awful.

657
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,440
Dude, showgirls of party games be awesome.

658
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,360
Wait, wait, Dan, Dan, Dan,

659
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,600
we got to get Dan on mic with that.

660
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,000
Can you hand Dan the mic real quick?

661
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,080
My Double Dragon score is 68,920.

662
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,280
Can I shake your hand, sir?

663
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,200
I want to shake your hand.

664
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,120
You are a gaming stud, sir, Dan.

665
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,960
Now, Dan.

666
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,780
I have to say for the record,

667
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,600
I'm listening to you guys talking here.

668
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,500
Your opinions about games are all crap.

669
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,720
The arcade Contra is awesome.

670
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,280
I like Contra.

671
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,440
Double Dragon rules.

672
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,280
Wait, wait, wait.

673
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,440
When did I say shit about Contra?

674
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,280
I did.

675
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,120
Oh, you did.

676
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,940
Loki did.

677
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,780
Well, fuck Loki.

678
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,620
All right.

679
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,600
Double Dragon rules.

680
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,560
Double Dragon sucks.

681
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,920
It has slow down.

682
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,240
It has flicker.

683
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,460
It's cheap.

684
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,240
The weapons don't do shit.

685
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,200
Yeah.

686
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,760
It's all about the elbow punch.

687
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,800
But you are right.

688
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,040
There are no good Katamari games except for the first one.

689
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,000
What other games?

690
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,760
I will say this, to Double Dragon's credit,

691
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,480
there are no other games where you get assaulted

692
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,160
by transsexual bitches carrying whips.

693
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,080
Like no other game do the trannies come out

694
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,640
and force you to try to kick your ass.

695
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,420
Like I can't, I can't think of any.

696
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,520
Streets of Rage 2.

697
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:13,520
Yeah, very good point, yes.

698
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,880
Fine.

699
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,320
Yet again, I get upstaged by Dan on this fine program.

700
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,160
Fine.

701
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,480
OrangeLawnsRadio.com.

702
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,560
All right, let's see.

703
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,380
So what else?

704
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,400
What capped off our bad game day?

705
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,240
Oh yes.

706
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,400
I told Alan, I said, okay.

707
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,240
I said, this game is literally worse than Yaris.

708
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,840
And Alan goes, Yaris?

709
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,680
Like the car?

710
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,520
That's a car.

711
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,340
That's a car, right?

712
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,680
And I'm like, yeah, it's a car,

713
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,840
but don't you know the game Yaris?

714
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,000
And he's like, no, they made a game out of Yaris.

715
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,840
I'm like, turn off the,

716
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,040
we gotta go to the arcade right now

717
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,080
and play Yaris right now.

718
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,200
And the minute you launch the game Yaris,

719
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,400
for those that forgot because it's been a few years

720
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,400
and I'm gonna bring back all your haunting memories

721
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,220
of the past.

722
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:57,160
The game starts with a Yaris like driving,

723
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,500
or no, no, there's like a little robot spider on the ground

724
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,560
and then it pans out and a big Yaris drives in

725
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,940
and a robot claw comes out of the hood

726
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,140
and like zaps the robot spider.

727
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,520
And I look over at Alan and Alan just has this like,

728
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,360
what?

729
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,200
Look on his face.

730
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,160
I thought it was like a Pixar intro,

731
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,400
like a cute car animation.

732
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,400
Like, all right, this is the opening sequence of the game.

733
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,300
No, that is the game.

734
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:23,140
You're shooting, you're shooting little gas pump spiders.

735
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:26,640
Yeah, so then I made Alan, I made him play a race.

736
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,920
I was like, no, you need to play a really bad game

737
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,760
and see what this is like.

738
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,600
So I made him play a race and that's when he started going,

739
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,240
this is rape, this is emotional rape.

740
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,080
I don't like it, this is bad.

741
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:39,300
And then, yeah, so what'd you think of Yaris?

742
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:44,280
I am very happy to hear that it was free.

743
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:51,180
And for promotional purposes only, so.

744
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,960
And then finally, once that was over,

745
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,640
I redeemed myself with some Fatal Fury special.

746
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,980
So I got something good in.

747
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,360
And not only is it bad in the fact that the game

748
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,480
is just horrible and of poor quality,

749
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,680
it also is bad in the fact that it led the way

750
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:09,560
to pirating Xbox Live arcade games on modified consoles.

751
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,060
Thank you, Yaris exploit.

752
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,960
All right, that's-

753
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,220
So there is no good redeeming value about that game

754
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,520
other than the fact that it can make the bottoms

755
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,680
of worse lists and stuff like that.

756
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:25,200
Um, yeah, I don't know what else to say about that.

757
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,440
I mean, it's kind of funny though,

758
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,440
because we also, somehow we forgot to mention,

759
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,840
we were playing Puzzle Fighter II

760
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,660
over the weekends on my own.

761
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,840
That's a game by Backbone Entertainment, did that game.

762
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,620
They also did Yaris, and you're kind of like,

763
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,600
my, my, how the mighty have fallen.

764
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,280
But I guess everybody's allowed one crappy title,

765
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,120
I don't know.

766
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,400
I randomly played Boom Boom Rocket again today too.

767
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,080
I don't know, I realized I was missing

768
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,120
one stinking achievement in that game.

769
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,080
So I kind of went back to go see if I could get it

770
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,300
and it involved playing some very hard songs.

771
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,160
But apparently I'm still number one on my friends list.

772
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,000
Woo!

773
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,160
So I don't know, I'll have to go in

774
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,360
and try to play that a little more.

775
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,880
Cause I, the last time I had played Boom Boom Rocket

776
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,640
was probably two and a half years ago.

777
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,120
So, anyhow, let's get into some gaming news here

778
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,560
and some housekeeping.

779
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,280
Real quick, of course, if DarkSakura was here,

780
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,920
you know, she's not here to tell you about her gaming week,

781
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,680
but I'm sure she would say something like,

782
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:16,940
I played Star Trek Online and Pagle on my iPhone.

783
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,200
And yeah, all right.

784
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,600
Anyhow, we'll let her talk about her gaming week

785
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,600
when she gets here.

786
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,640
Housekeeping tonight.

787
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,120
First off, I want to give a big thank you

788
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,320
to some of the people behind the scenes at OLR.

789
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,560
I mean, obviously we have a lot of people

790
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,360
behind the scenes that make things work.

791
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,200
Deep Man and VX JasonXV who do the website.

792
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,240
But also Dark Tetsuya does a lot of work

793
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,840
for kind of like writing on the website once in a while.

794
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,800
And I know Act F does some work with him as well.

795
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,680
And I know Dark Tetsuya and Misty kind of got together

796
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,680
for this side project that is the OLR best hits.

797
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,360
And it's the greatest hits, if you will,

798
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,080
of like our first 20 episodes.

799
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,240
And when I mean our first 20 episodes,

800
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,760
I mean the first 20 episodes from 2002

801
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,080
back when we talked about nothing but DDR.

802
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,900
So it's done, it's up, and you can download it.

803
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,880
The only thing I want to warn you about,

804
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,400
it was a totally different show back then.

805
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,080
And also something that I think they didn't mention

806
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,080
in the audio, which is fine.

807
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,160
But when we started the show, our live 365 feed,

808
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,460
because you know the all games partnership

809
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:25,200
didn't happen till like 06-ish, 07 maybe?

810
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,840
I can't, gosh, time flies.

811
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,720
But so when we first started our show,

812
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,760
we were on our own live 365 station.

813
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,200
And we were running a modem friendly, dial up friendly,

814
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,040
56K friendly radio stream.

815
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,960
So the audio quality was not that great.

816
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,040
So I just want to warn you, if you're gonna go check it out,

817
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,080
keep in mind, the audio may hurt your ears a little bit

818
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,700
because it was dial up friendly.

819
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,000
But if you want to hear the kind of stuff

820
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,120
we talked about a year ago, it's pretty cool.

821
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:50,960
So I really want to-

822
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,780
A year ago.

823
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,920
I'm sorry, years ago.

824
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,760
I want to thank Dartisia for putting that together.

825
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,000
It's pretty funny.

826
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,280
All right, you can find that at orangelaundraded.com.

827
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,880
It's right there on the front page.

828
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,180
Other housekeeping tonight.

829
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,440
We do have a list list coming up in part B tonight

830
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,180
because it is our 360th episode.

831
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:13,480
So we have a list list tipping our hat to the Xbox 360

832
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,080
tonight.

833
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,760
So we'll get into that a little later on in the show in part

834
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,080
B. But if you want to vote, you have

835
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:23,120
to be in our chat room, chat.orangelaundraded.com.

836
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,280
All right, let's get into some actual gaming news.

837
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,920
Because Alan and I have been talking

838
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,640
about a lot of old games.

839
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,240
So let's get into some new games and, oddly enough,

840
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,160
some 360 news.

841
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,080
Yes, Loki?

842
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,320
Yes, this week we had some images leak out

843
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,240
of a possible slimmed down 360.

844
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,520
And much like images leaked out before of a 360

845
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:49,480
with an HDMI port on it, I have to say this is probably

846
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,640
going to happen too.

847
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,000
And it kind of coincides with a lot of other stuff

848
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,260
we'll probably be talking about a little bit later.

849
00:31:55,260 --> 00:32:01,280
But it shows, obviously, there's a couple new internal plugs

850
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,480
for SATA cords and stuff like that.

851
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,140
So it's thought that perhaps the hard drive is

852
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:09,020
going to be internal, much like the PS3.

853
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:12,680
Also, they've combined the GPU and CPU into one chip.

854
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,080
And it's got an actual kind of a different cooling system now,

855
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,320
just more like a traditional heat sink and fan.

856
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,040
Also, the memory card slot is missing.

857
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,720
But once again, that kind of gets

858
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,760
into something we'll be talking about probably

859
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,200
a little bit later.

860
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,280
But it's interesting.

861
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,480
And I have a feeling this is probably

862
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,160
going to be out by the end of this year.

863
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,840
I will bet you anything.

864
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:40,840
Probably around the same time as Project Natal.

865
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,600
Yeah, definitely.

866
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,640
I think it'll come out in conjunction with Natal.

867
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,240
I bet it'll be announced at E3.

868
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,040
Do you think Natal's built into this thing?

869
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:47,800
No.

870
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,640
I don't think it is.

871
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,960
I think it's going to be just an accessory.

872
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,760
I just think the system's going to be slimmed down kind

873
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,560
of to appeal to more of like the Wii crowd type thing.

874
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,360
Maybe they're going to drop the price on it or something.

875
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,040
Now what's the source of these pictures?

876
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,960
Because I want to try and figure out how true this is.

877
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,540
Because remember guys, this is a rumor.

878
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,640
So what's the source of these pictures?

879
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:11,720
The source, it's apparently from some Chinese tech forum.

880
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,760
Apparently it was, I'm thinking that it's probably

881
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,080
leaked from some sort of production line.

882
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:24,040
The same type of forum leaked up some other revisions of.

883
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,120
Yeah, I seem to remember the first PS3 slim info

884
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,920
was coming from an Asian web forum.

885
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,400
Because that's what the factory was making some of the parts.

886
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:32,880
Yeah.

887
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,200
And there's some things on here.

888
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,480
I mean, you'll notice there's like developer headers

889
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,000
on there, these on the current 360s

890
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,800
are where people do the JTAG exploits and stuff like that.

891
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,560
Obviously this will probably be fixed on this console

892
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,720
when it comes out.

893
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,600
Stuff like that and different like power headers and whatnot

894
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,720
that are, I mean this one looks like the CD-ROM or the DVD

895
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,320
drive and then probably they're going

896
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,880
to have one that's going to plug into the SATA drive

897
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,160
if it's going to be internal.

898
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,440
So it's interesting.

899
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,800
OK, so Loki, on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being this

900
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,640
is a fucking lie and 10 being this is fucking happening.

901
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,680
How true is this rumor?

902
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,200
I'd say it's probably 10.

903
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,800
That's a pretty big bet, all right.

904
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,080
Well, it's where there's smoke, there's fire.

905
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,880
And yeah, I realize that we're only a few weeks away

906
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,600
from April Fool's Day, but come on.

907
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,000
I mean, it just makes sense that they would do this.

908
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,680
And like I said, with the other news that's coming out,

909
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,640
it makes sense why certain things are missing from this.

910
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,040
So yeah.

911
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,520
Spyro in our chat room, chat.orangelandrater.com

912
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,520
says, we already have normal 360s.

913
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,280
We don't need slimmer ones.

914
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,040
Yeah, that's what the PS3 people said too,

915
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,760
but now they have slim PS3s.

916
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,320
And it was the best move they made.

917
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,000
Well, they made the cost of the console cheaper

918
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,080
by consolidating some parts and taking

919
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,600
some things that weren't really used very commonly out.

920
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,520
What did they take out of the other PS3 model?

921
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,040
Was it USB?

922
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,120
They took out USB ports and stuff like that.

923
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:08,160
But yeah, it's just slimmer dies and parts get cheaper.

924
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,540
Well, and that's my other thought

925
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,560
is that, OK, part of why I think there is a lot of truth

926
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,360
to this is that it makes sense that they're trying to

927
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,520
consolidate some of the parts because you're talking

928
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,520
about a price reduction.

929
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,480
Because how awesome would it be if Microsoft

930
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,960
gets the price low enough where they can launch a 360

931
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,640
console with Natal for $199?

932
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,520
So that's what they charge for their low-end 360 now, right?

933
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,360
$199?

934
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,400
What if they could do that with Natal for $199?

935
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,080
I mean, that's a pretty big kick in the pants to Nintendo

936
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,440
come this Christmas season.

937
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,040
Although if that were to happen, it's not out of the question.

938
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,920
Nintendo might say $99 a week.

939
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,960
It might not make a difference.

940
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,460
So I think right now at the point,

941
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,800
I mean, $99 a week would be kind of cool

942
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,040
because then people will be like, oh, yeah,

943
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,240
I'm going to definitely pick up one of those.

944
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,320
But picking up a system doesn't mean you're

945
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,560
going to buy the games for it.

946
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,400
I mean, look at all these people that

947
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,080
bought just the Wii for Wii Sports.

948
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,360
And that's all they're playing.

949
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,180
And they're not buying Wii Sports Resort.

950
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,760
And they're not buying anything else.

951
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,560
They're just playing Wii Sports.

952
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:15,440
Or like me, I haven't played the Wii in months.

953
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,680
Neither have I. In fact, I was going to hook it up this week

954
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,880
to play Rondo of Blood, which for some reason

955
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,920
is on our show all night.

956
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,040
It finally got its release on Monday, which is exciting.

957
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,080
It's because Jamie's not here for part A tonight.

958
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,360
So that's how we missed it.

959
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,920
But Rondo of Blood came out.

960
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,100
And I was like, oh, I should hook up the Wii and download it.

961
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,600
But then I was like, let's play terrible games on the 360

962
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,120
instead for whatever reason.

963
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,400
So I don't know.

964
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,240
Alan, I know you already own a 360.

965
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,320
But do you think there's anything here

966
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,080
that maybe somebody who already has a 360

967
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,360
might want to get one of these?

968
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,900
Do you think there's anything in here

969
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,480
for us gamers that probably already have one?

970
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,000
Maybe to trade up so that hopefully the Red Ring of Death

971
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,840
isn't an issue.

972
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,600
Well, the rumor is that these are going

973
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,880
to be 45 nanometer chips.

974
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,200
So those are pretty stable.

975
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,720
I mean, heat wise, it uses a lot less electricity,

976
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,880
a lot less heat.

977
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,720
And it looks like the way that they have it right now,

978
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,440
if it is going to be slimmer, it's

979
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,240
literally going to be heat sink fan opening to the case.

980
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,020
I mean, there's no elaborate ducting system

981
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,160
with fans blowing air and stuff like that.

982
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,880
It's just, it's straight out of the case.

983
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,400
So I mean, I would assume it's going to be more stable.

984
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,560
I mean, even the new consoles now are more stable.

985
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,520
So there may be a little bit of bugs worked out.

986
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,840
But we'll have to see.

987
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,600
And hopefully they've learned their lesson.

988
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,860
They're going to test their consoles quite a bit.

989
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,480
I just think it's going to be interesting

990
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,160
if they do decide to put an internal hard drive in there.

991
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,440
Then I wonder if they're looking to say, hey,

992
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,280
we're not going to try to make tons of money

993
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,080
off these hard drives now.

994
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,160
Because I would assume that maybe you

995
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,400
can upgrade your own hard drives.

996
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,600
And even if you can't, I mean, the modding community

997
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,240
out there, now that it has the standard SATA ports on it,

998
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,720
you're going to be able to upgrade your own hard drive.

999
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,400
Out of curiosity, could this, you know,

1000
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,400
you brought up modding.

1001
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,240
And you've talked a lot about the different mods out there,

1002
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,460
like the J tags and so forth, the 360s.

1003
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,600
Do you think part of this is to combat modding?

1004
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,200
Maybe.

1005
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,320
I mean, because the J tags stuff right now,

1006
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,920
I mean, they've already patched it out.

1007
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,960
It's just you have to have an old enough,

1008
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,520
basically an old enough firmware to be able to run it.

1009
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,760
And a lot of the consoles now are,

1010
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,520
especially the ones being released now,

1011
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,680
have firmwares that you can't drop back down.

1012
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,220
But they're figuring out how to mod different consoles.

1013
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:40,440
Because there's the ones that had the old 16 megabyte,

1014
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:45,240
or yeah, the 16 megabyte NAND flash, now the ones

1015
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,880
that they've added, like the 256, the 512,

1016
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,200
to the newer consoles that they have actual onboard memory

1017
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,680
cards almost.

1018
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,880
Those now, they're figuring out how to mod as well.

1019
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,900
But a lot of them aren't with an old enough dashboard

1020
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,000
to be able to do it.

1021
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,640
I mean, I'm sure they're going to find a way to do something.

1022
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,440
At the very least, they're going to find

1023
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,800
ways to add a bigger hard drive if you want it.

1024
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,200
But they may actually, if they're smart,

1025
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,920
go the route of Sony and allow you

1026
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,800
to upgrade your own hard drive.

1027
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,680
Well, we'll see.

1028
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,680
Because I think we have another story coming up

1029
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:22,200
about further evidence that the Xbox 360 hard drives may

1030
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,200
be a thing of the past.

1031
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,720
But first, I want to get into another story about the 360,

1032
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,880
since it is episode 360 of our show, after all.

1033
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,320
Talking about a patent.

1034
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,320
Yes, that's right.

1035
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,160
Thanks to the US Patent Office and people

1036
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,480
having to file those patents to protect their ideas,

1037
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,720
sometimes we get spoiled on things that may or may not

1038
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,440
actually end up happening.

1039
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,440
I think we've seen patents in the past.

1040
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,520
Didn't Nintendo trademark like, or I

1041
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,840
mean, I guess there's a difference between trademark

1042
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,340
and patent.

1043
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:50,240
But for the purposes of rumor spoiling, it's very similar.

1044
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,760
Didn't they trademark like a bunch of names for that system

1045
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,280
that ended up being the Wii?

1046
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,240
You know, like a lot of times they do this.

1047
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,960
They trademark a bunch of ideas, just

1048
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,200
make sure there's no, God, those people that just like.

1049
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,080
Patent squatters.

1050
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,240
Patent squatters, thank you.

1051
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,240
Or trademark squatters.

1052
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,120
Yeah, that was looking for the people that,

1053
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,240
oh, we invented the rumble thing first,

1054
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,080
even though we never did anything with it.

1055
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:17,320
And all those people to try and get to the ideas before them.

1056
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,640
Well, anyhow, this, though, sounds very feasible to me.

1057
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,400
And this is a Microsoft patent that apparently was filed back

1058
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,560
in mid 2008.

1059
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:29,720
What would happen is that with this thing, this interface,

1060
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,000
I guess, that they're patenting, you would actually be able

1061
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,960
to download a game add-on from the Xbox Live Marketplace

1062
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,400
when an in-game prompt in the game tells you to do so.

1063
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,200
Believe it or not, that doesn't really happen right now.

1064
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,760
You know, the game will kind of say,

1065
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,720
especially if you're playing a demo,

1066
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,320
you can hit a button to kind of go to the Xbox Live store,

1067
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,960
but there's like some extra steps

1068
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,760
that you take before you actually purchase.

1069
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,920
And this sounds a little more to me

1070
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,640
like you would just be able to buy the add-on right there,

1071
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,640
practically with a touch of a button, if you had the.

1072
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,000
It would be like, for example, I was playing Borderlands

1073
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,520
and, you know, say my friend was playing

1074
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,760
and he wanted to join my game

1075
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,880
and he doesn't have the expansion that I have,

1076
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,120
and then it'll say.

1077
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,320
And I want to clarify, I'm sorry,

1078
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,040
but this is an important point of the trademark

1079
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:18,400
is that the content that you buy is required

1080
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,120
for a particular online game they attempt to launch.

1081
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:24,080
So Loki's Borderlands example, if, you know,

1082
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,720
your friend has this expansion that you're trying to play,

1083
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,440
then you could buy it at the touch of a button.

1084
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,000
Or I'm thinking the big one would be Rock Band.

1085
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,040
Like that would be huge because, you know,

1086
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,240
oh, we want to play this song.

1087
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,480
Oh, I don't have that song.

1088
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,280
Press X and you will buy the song

1089
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,700
with your imaginary money that's actually real money

1090
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,600
that got turned into imaginary money.

1091
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And that's what you pay for with Microsoft system.

1092
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,200
Like it would be that easy.

1093
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,840
I'm imagining other things like Game Room

1094
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,100
would kind of tie into this too.

1095
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,200
I was trying to think of,

1096
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,160
I was trying to come up with this.

1097
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,600
I was trying to explain to Alan yesterday

1098
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,320
and I don't think my point really came across very well.

1099
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,520
I was like, I think Game Room is kind of like Rock Band.

1100
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,360
I think Game Room kind of has a lot in common

1101
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,520
with Rock Band.

1102
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,680
It's a system that's really gonna make their bucks

1103
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,720
off of all these microtransactions is, you know,

1104
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,640
where, you know, well, obviously they're not making

1105
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,280
any money off of the shell of the game.

1106
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,960
And it's kind of like, well, yeah,

1107
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,280
you pay $40 up front for Rock Band,

1108
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,760
but you get all these default songs.

1109
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,640
But for Game Room, you pay zero, you get nothing,

1110
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,360
but the whole thing's out of microtransactions.

1111
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,720
It's actually like, a better comparison would be

1112
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,920
that Game Room is more like that PSP demo

1113
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,120
for Rock Band Unplugged.

1114
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:30,960
You remember that?

1115
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,920
They came with like one song and all the rest

1116
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,320
would play just DLC is all it would play.

1117
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,160
Yeah.

1118
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,120
It's almost kind of like that, but for classic games.

1119
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,740
So anyhow, but that might be another one.

1120
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,520
Hey, you go visit your friend's Game Room

1121
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,560
and they wanna play you in a battle of, I don't know,

1122
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,520
what's a two player game, Contra or something.

1123
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,880
You know, even though you've already bought that

1124
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,320
on Xbox Live some time ago.

1125
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,800
Well, you could press X and you can buy Contra

1126
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,840
for 300 Microsoft points and go to town.

1127
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,240
So it's just making it easier to spend

1128
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,440
your imaginary money, essentially.

1129
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,840
So yeah, and you don't have to quit the lobby to do so.

1130
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,780
That's another important thing too, is that sometimes

1131
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,720
if you wanna buy an expansion, you have to back out

1132
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,440
of the lobby, go back to the menu, do this all,

1133
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,180
no, it would be a lot faster this way.

1134
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,760
So I don't know, is this dangerous?

1135
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,200
Is this something that maybe they shouldn't be implementing

1136
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,760
because it makes it almost too easy to download games?

1137
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,280
Or what?

1138
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,960
Or is this just a logical, yeah, this is more

1139
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,720
of a give me your money type of step?

1140
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,000
I think it's just, it makes sense.

1141
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,240
It makes it more streamlined.

1142
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,840
I mean, you don't have to do it,

1143
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:40,720
but I don't know, it makes it easier.

1144
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,720
I would worry that there's like 13 year olds

1145
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,020
that are gonna sit there and hit the button,

1146
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:46,160
but hopefully their parents know about parental controls

1147
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,960
and there's no credit cards on file.

1148
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:52,880
iTunes and Amazon already have one click purchasing

1149
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,040
where you can just, with one click, buy TV, whatever.

1150
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,440
So just to have that, for Xbox to have that

1151
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,860
in their marketplace, I mean, other online stores

1152
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:04,160
have already, are already doing this, so.

1153
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,000
That's a good point.

1154
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,560
You know, and iTunes, I remember some time ago,

1155
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,560
I used to have, it was before they made the big upgrade

1156
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,040
to the engine, what are they on right now, 7.0?

1157
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,460
I think it was right when they upgraded to 7.0.

1158
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:18,480
On my old iTunes, whenever I would click buy a song,

1159
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,240
it would go into a shopping cart.

1160
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,280
Well, they got rid of the shopping cart completely,

1161
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,200
which I think is kind of bullshit.

1162
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,360
And what you do now is if you click,

1163
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,960
you don't click on buy song,

1164
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,320
but you click on the little dropdown next to that

1165
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,320
and you click add to wishlist.

1166
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,500
And they say that the wishlist replaced the shopping cart.

1167
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:38,060
But I think the way they did that was really shady.

1168
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,180
Like, I hate the way that Apple handled that

1169
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,680
because I'm so used to being able to click the big button

1170
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,280
and it just goes to my shopping cart.

1171
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,620
And then, you know, when I, maybe once a week

1172
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,800
or once every other week, I would just buy the cart

1173
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,320
because what I would do, here's what I used to do a lot.

1174
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:55,500
I would play online games and I would listen to online radio

1175
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,060
while I played the games.

1176
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,920
And if there was a song I liked

1177
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,980
that they played on the radio,

1178
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:02,440
I would go into iTunes, search for the artist right there,

1179
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,640
add the song to my cart.

1180
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,700
And like at the end of the week, I'd download all the songs.

1181
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,040
I have a new CD for my car.

1182
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,440
Like it was an awesome system.

1183
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,840
But then when iTunes switched it up,

1184
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,080
so now it's just click and you buy right away,

1185
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,840
I thought that kind of was shady.

1186
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,720
Like, yeah, they have the wishlist,

1187
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,260
but come on, Apple fans.

1188
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,840
They made that harder to get to.

1189
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,500
They made it harder to have a queue.

1190
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,100
They made it easier to buy a game right away,

1191
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,680
which was kind of crappy in my opinion.

1192
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,880
But that's a good point, Alan,

1193
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,500
is that this system already really exists in other places.

1194
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,880
And there's no, even without Microsoft Bucks on iTunes,

1195
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,200
it's real money.

1196
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,600
Good point.

1197
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,440
All right.

1198
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,480
Well, let's move on with some more stories.

1199
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,400
Loki.

1200
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,240
Yeah.

1201
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,200
So one of the new updates that's gonna be coming soon

1202
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,880
is USB storage support for the Xbox 360.

1203
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,400
Finally, you're gonna be able to just use

1204
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,720
your stupid jump drives or whatever to save your games

1205
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,320
versus having to buy the really expensive memory cards,

1206
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:04,120
which the last I checked was the 512 megabyte card,

1207
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,280
half a gig, for 50 bucks.

1208
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,160
And I just bought one of those memory cards

1209
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:08,980
not that long ago,

1210
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:10,440
although I don't think I bought the half a gig one.

1211
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,200
Maybe I did, but it only cost me 20 bucks.

1212
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,640
Whatever I bought was 20 bucks,

1213
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,160
and it came with Geometry Wars,

1214
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,920
which I tried to give to Alan,

1215
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,400
but you couldn't take it off the memory card,

1216
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,360
which was stupid.

1217
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,280
That is dumb.

1218
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:27,280
But thankfully, you will be able to use your

1219
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:31,980
USB memory cards to go ahead and save your games.

1220
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,080
You can do download content, save games,

1221
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:38,500
games in demand, title updates, et cetera, indie games.

1222
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,660
And the thing is, though,

1223
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:45,840
you will only be able to use cards up to 16 gigabytes,

1224
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:50,840
meaning you can't just plug in say a USB hard drive

1225
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:51,840
or something like that.

1226
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,040
That's 120 gigs.

1227
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,080
Or those fucking terabyte drives now.

1228
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,440
You just bought one of those not that long ago, right?

1229
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,200
How much should I set you back?

1230
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,120
For the one terabyte USB drive?

1231
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,840
Yeah, about 110, 120, yeah.

1232
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,480
It's disgusting how much data

1233
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,080
you can take with you on the go now.

1234
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,600
So I mean, at the very least,

1235
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:12,600
you can store say, just without using a USB hub,

1236
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:16,040
you know, a good almost 60 gigs on there.

1237
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,880
I mean, now I'm assuming,

1238
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,760
I don't know if you can use like USB hubs on this,

1239
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,680
but maybe you could even plug in more drives

1240
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,240
if you really wanted to.

1241
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:30,240
But the way that whole thing works is really weird

1242
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:32,700
because I don't know if people know this,

1243
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,860
you could plug in your iPod into the 360

1244
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:37,400
and play songs off of it.

1245
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,180
And those drives are much larger than 16 gigs.

1246
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,560
It seems like if it's a media thing,

1247
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,720
you're only using it for like media files,

1248
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,800
that it doesn't care how large the storage is.

1249
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,520
Yeah, well you can play movies today.

1250
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,800
You can play a movie or a music file off a USB stick.

1251
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,660
Yeah, you can do that,

1252
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,320
but you can't store stuff from a 360.

1253
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,000
You can't transfer like saves or anything.

1254
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:56,840
Correct.

1255
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,260
And that's what this is basically gonna allow you to do.

1256
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:03,040
However, this also once again plays into what we saw

1257
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:07,840
with the supposedly slim 360 motherboard.

1258
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,300
There is no memory card slot.

1259
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:12,600
There's just the front USB port, the back USB port,

1260
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,040
and that's it.

1261
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,020
So it makes you think, okay,

1262
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,660
so they're just gonna use USB storage

1263
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:19,080
if you wanna do like a memory card.

1264
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,880
And I think that's a good idea

1265
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,400
because to be honest, the Microsoft storage

1266
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,680
is really, really overpriced

1267
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,400
and their hard drives are really overpriced.

1268
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,560
So I do hope that they allow users

1269
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,640
to use their own hard drives

1270
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,220
or have it come with a hard drive

1271
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:37,800
and just allow you to upgrade it later on

1272
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,560
if they're still gonna sell their crappy

1273
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:40,380
overpriced hard drives

1274
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:44,360
because I mean, hell, it's $200 now for like a 100

1275
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:47,920
or I think it's like $200 for a 120 gig hard drive

1276
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,960
or maybe not $200, but it's over $100

1277
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,880
for a 120 gig hard drive, which is retarded.

1278
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,160
But you could buy a one terabyte USB drive

1279
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,120
10 times the storage.

1280
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:58,360
Yeah, one terabyte, yeah, drive

1281
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,720
that has a USB connection on it.

1282
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,080
So it makes no sense that they would just,

1283
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,140
I mean, it makes sense for them

1284
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,360
because they're making a lot of money off of it

1285
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,880
because they're locking out everybody else.

1286
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:12,080
But I mean, really, there's cheaper solutions out there

1287
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,560
if you open it up.

1288
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,920
Well, I think, and I'm reading in our chat room

1289
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,680
at chat.orangewonstrated.com, YYR says the limit

1290
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,200
will be two drives according to reports.

1291
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:25,320
But even then, take two 16 gig drives, that's 32 gigs.

1292
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,380
That's still quite a bit.

1293
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:29,520
I mean, yeah, it's not as big as 120 gigabyte,

1294
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,400
but that's enough for most of you guys.

1295
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,640
Like if you don't do video on the 360

1296
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,140
and you don't install a lot of games,

1297
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,160
you're in good shape.

1298
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,480
And honestly, I don't know how much good it would do to,

1299
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,140
well, I take that back.

1300
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:43,200
Do you think it would do a lot of good

1301
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,880
to install a game to a USB stick

1302
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,740
as opposed to just doing it on a regular hard drive?

1303
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:49,200
I guess the difference would be unnoticeable.

1304
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:50,880
But I keep thinking.

1305
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,120
I would think maybe the USB drive

1306
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,260
might be a little bit faster.

1307
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:55,040
It's hard to say because the hard drives

1308
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,520
that are in there right now, they're just,

1309
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,440
I wanna say they're 5,400 RPM.

1310
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,580
They're really, I mean, they're standard

1311
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:05,240
for a laptop drive, but when you're talking

1312
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:08,160
about like desktop drives, they're 7,200.

1313
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,580
It's obviously a little slower.

1314
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:12,800
And it's also flash, so there's really no moving parts.

1315
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,680
So really, you'd be limited by the speed of USB 2.0,

1316
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,320
which would probably be, I would say,

1317
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,520
faster than that drive.

1318
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,240
The chat room is lighting up with some comments,

1319
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,540
and I wanna say some of these.

1320
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:23,800
The chat is reminding us that the 120 gig hard drive

1321
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,960
is no longer there.

1322
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,240
Spyro says the 60 gigabyte is left.

1323
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,000
That's it, nothing else.

1324
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,080
Bresloh wants to say, the reason the HDs are overpriced

1325
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,360
is because of the drive manufacturers found out

1326
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,680
what the hard drives were for,

1327
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,240
and they decided to screw a lot of money out of MS.

1328
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,080
True story.

1329
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,800
That's a dumb excuse, I'm sorry.

1330
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,640
Well.

1331
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,480
If they're gonna screw you out,

1332
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,160
screw you for those hard drives,

1333
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,060
just use different hard drives.

1334
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:57,480
All right, well speaking of dumb excuses,

1335
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,320
let's go to another completely different type of story here.

1336
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:03,280
This is a story that has to do with GameStop,

1337
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,680
and it also has to do with console shortages,

1338
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,600
and apparently GameStop has commented

1339
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:11,480
on the recent Wii shortages and PlayStation 3 shortages,

1340
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,700
and they are saying that those shortages

1341
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:16,440
do not look like they are coming to an end very soon.

1342
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,880
There's a quote here from Tony Bartell,

1343
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,320
who is the executive VP of merchandising for GameStop,

1344
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,040
saying, quote, they could sell a lot more hardware

1345
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,880
than what we have on both the PS3 and the Wii platform.

1346
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,520
They are saying it is not gonna end until early summer

1347
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,560
is when this is projected to end.

1348
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,400
And then by then,

1349
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,320
they're gonna have another console iteration,

1350
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:37,680
and it's just gonna be the same damn thing all over again.

1351
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,800
Just to clarify,

1352
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,520
they say the Wii is supposed to get the resupply first,

1353
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,200
and he thinks this is all because of the surge

1354
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,520
of the sales of the consoles from the last holiday season.

1355
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,460
I've heard a different theory, though,

1356
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:51,640
and that has to do with,

1357
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,360
and was it you who was telling me this, Alan?

1358
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,720
Somebody was telling me this

1359
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,040
about the whole fiscal year that plays into this.

1360
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,760
That was you on a previous show.

1361
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,600
The fiscal year,

1362
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,360
did you think the fiscal year's playing into this

1363
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,680
on both Nintendo and Sony?

1364
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,520
I don't know, they're just dicking around, though,

1365
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,080
right now is what I know,

1366
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,320
because first party anything from Sony

1367
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,700
is like damn hard to get right now.

1368
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,760
So who knows what the situation is,

1369
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,080
and unfortunately, they could be sending them to retailers,

1370
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,400
but apparently retailers are saying

1371
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,240
they're not getting them.

1372
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,840
I just have a hard time believing three months

1373
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,840
after the holiday season,

1374
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,920
and I mean, the holiday season was pretty good to them,

1375
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,440
but come on.

1376
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,160
I mean, it's not like,

1377
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,040
there's no way you're that short.

1378
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:37,080
You know, you would prepare for the holiday season

1379
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:41,200
by ramping up production prior to the holiday season.

1380
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,620
I just don't see why you would, you know, not.

1381
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:51,680
Well, and how many freaking like PS3s

1382
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,680
are being sold right now?

1383
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,240
I mean, it just doesn't seem like

1384
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,600
it's as in demand right now.

1385
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,240
Maybe for birthdays and stuff, but that's it.

1386
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,520
A lot of them might have to do with the fact

1387
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,840
that they're hard to find right now,

1388
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:07,040
but I'm sorry, I mean, how many years has it been now?

1389
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,800
Just because it's not on shelves now

1390
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,220
is not making a demand for, you know what I mean?

1391
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:13,400
People aren't like trying to find them

1392
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,640
like they were when it first came out.

1393
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:17,960
People are waiting, they're just like,

1394
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,640
oh well, I can't find it now, I'm just not gonna buy it,

1395
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,140
because I don't have the money, or you know,

1396
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:28,140
times are tough, they're trying to purposely hold them back

1397
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,320
to create this sort of demand for the console,

1398
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,400
that's pretty dumb.

1399
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,440
People are seeing right through it now.

1400
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,400
I, just while Loki's been talking here,

1401
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,480
I pulled up BestBuy.com just to see,

1402
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,040
because they'll let you do a store search

1403
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,460
to see what the inventory looks like.

1404
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:46,340
Just so you know, they have a couple packages available.

1405
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:51,340
There's a 299.99 Sony PlayStation 3, it's the slim,

1406
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:54,680
so it's like the slim by itself, it's the 120.

1407
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,360
It is sold out online, and if you go into it

1408
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,160
to do like a store search, it won't even let you.

1409
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,960
It says store pickup, not available.

1410
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,300
So that is gone.

1411
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:06,740
Now there's a 349.99 console, 250 gig.

1412
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:09,480
You can buy it online, but then there's this red thing

1413
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,600
that says not available for shipping.

1414
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:15,940
So I guess you could maybe only do the in-store pickup.

1415
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:18,680
Well I did a search around the local zip code here,

1416
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:22,000
and the six closest stores in the Sacramento area,

1417
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,600
Citrus Heights, Arden Fair, Folsom,

1418
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,920
Roseville, Natomas, Elk Grove, all out, unavailable.

1419
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:30,040
So the shortage is real, there's no disputing that.

1420
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:34,040
But it's weird why that this is happening.

1421
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,720
And like I said, the theory,

1422
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,120
and it could be just someone talking,

1423
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:45,000
but the theory is that they're holding them until April,

1424
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,480
when their new fiscal quarter starts,

1425
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,160
because maybe either they've hit their numbers

1426
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:52,000
that they want this year, no point in really trying

1427
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,160
to boost their numbers, but for next financial year,

1428
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,160
maybe they wanna really try to boost their numbers.

1429
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,000
I don't know.

1430
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,920
The thing that seems ridiculous to me right now

1431
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,200
is that two of the biggest PlayStation 3 games

1432
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,100
that could have been system sellers are out now.

1433
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:10,380
Final Fantasy 13, although granted, the whole 360 thing,

1434
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:13,480
you know, if gamers want it, and they have a 360 already,

1435
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,360
they can just buy it there,

1436
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:17,080
and I know there's been a lot of back and forth

1437
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,300
about which version is better,

1438
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,740
but there's no difference, you guys.

1439
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:23,080
The differences are minuscule, so just drop it.

1440
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,440
I'm wondering on the audio, though,

1441
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,320
a question just to go on the Final Fantasy real quick,

1442
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,240
and this is totally random,

1443
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,320
but how's your audio sounding on that?

1444
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:34,740
Do their voices sound kind of metallic, I guess, to you?

1445
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:35,580
I mean, I know-

1446
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,680
No, but that could be your sound setup.

1447
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:38,520
You don't necessarily-

1448
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,020
But I have surround sound headphones,

1449
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,440
and I've done everything to try to configure it

1450
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,840
so that the sound sounds okay,

1451
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,860
but it still sounds kind of metallic.

1452
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:46,700
Seems okay to me.

1453
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,880
Like it's heavily buffered or something.

1454
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,740
Well, also, I do want to say, though,

1455
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:53,860
the other big game that's out,

1456
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:56,280
God of War 3 came out this week, hello?

1457
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,600
That is a system seller.

1458
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,240
That is one that people will run out

1459
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,820
and buy PlayStation 3s for, but they can't,

1460
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:04,440
and there's no God of War 3 bundle or nothing,

1461
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,400
and that really surprises me.

1462
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,940
That seems just not smart to have your big game out

1463
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:12,360
and not have the systems to back it up,

1464
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,760
especially if it's intentional.

1465
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,120
If it really, truly is an unintentional shortage,

1466
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,120
then okay, whatever, just bad luck.

1467
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:22,440
But if it's an intentional shortage, that was dumb.

1468
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,880
Then they should've delayed God of War 3,

1469
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,760
saying, you know, quality issues or whatever.

1470
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,480
They would've lied and said it was a quality thing

1471
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:30,720
or something.

1472
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,640
It's what they have coming out from first party for Sony

1473
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,940
in the next couple months.

1474
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:35,780
Not much.

1475
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:39,140
I mean, they have ModNation Racers, but that's in May.

1476
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:44,140
And then after that, well, that's it.

1477
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:46,260
So, ModNation Racers, which I don't think-

1478
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,060
Well, and then the move is-

1479
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:50,180
But that's not until the holiday, I mean.

1480
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:52,540
I don't know.

1481
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:56,020
All right, well, Loki, you have a little more,

1482
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:57,440
speaking of GameStop, right?

1483
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:00,020
Yes, they're still evaluating

1484
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:03,340
the Customer Loyalty Opportunity Program.

1485
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:05,920
Apparently, you may remember there was a survey

1486
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,900
that went out a while back saying that,

1487
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:10,560
you know, they're gonna have different tiered programs

1488
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,840
where you can maybe buy into it or whatever

1489
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:16,520
and you get certain discounts, perks, et cetera.

1490
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:20,440
Apparently, you know, GameStops, you know,

1491
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,040
they've commented that we're in the process

1492
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:25,040
of evaluating loyalty opportunities for our customers.

1493
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,880
As this is a work in progress,

1494
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,080
we're not gonna comment on any speculation

1495
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:31,740
to changes to our edge card program.

1496
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,760
And then they continue to go and comment on

1497
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:37,340
changes that are gonna happen to the edge card program.

1498
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:40,340
They're gonna be testing in foreign markets.

1499
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:45,340
Apparently, there's a French gaming chain named Micromania

1500
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,400
during the GameStop conference call.

1501
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,000
And I'm wondering if Micromania

1502
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
may be owned by GameStop now.

1503
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,880
They may have, yeah, they were bought out.

1504
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:59,240
It says, we believe that the loyalty program at Micromania

1505
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:02,320
drove some of the highest sales per store

1506
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,900
in Europe that we've seen.

1507
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,720
So we think it's a very effective program

1508
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:08,180
and that's the base for what we added

1509
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:11,440
to our existing loyalty program here at the edge.

1510
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:17,040
So let's see, some of these different perks

1511
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,900
they're gonna have here, they're saying,

1512
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:22,680
so Micromania had the MegaCart program for many, many years.

1513
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:23,920
It's probably the most successful

1514
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,960
video game loyalty program in existence.

1515
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,840
If you look at Micromania, as we did early on,

1516
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,900
you know, 86% of their transactions

1517
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:33,920
have a MicroCart ID associated with them.

1518
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,440
MicroCart is not only a loyalty program,

1519
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,080
it becomes a launch device in a vehicle.

1520
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,940
It becomes a marketing vehicle.

1521
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:44,760
It even helps you decide where to put a new store

1522
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:48,040
as a real estate vehicle.

1523
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:51,560
We believe that the loyalty program at Micromania

1524
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,680
drove some of the highest sales per store in Europe

1525
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:54,800
that we've ever seen.

1526
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,320
So we think it's a very effective program

1527
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,680
and that's the base, of course,

1528
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,800
what they're gonna use for the edge program.

1529
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,220
How theirs will be different,

1530
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:04,100
our program will be heavily built on heavily

1531
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:05,320
what you see at Micromania today,

1532
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,760
but it will add some very significant pieces.

1533
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,880
Our marketing team has done some extensive surveys,

1534
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:15,880
like we saw linked online, let's see here,

1535
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:19,120
of kinds of rewards that customers are looking for.

1536
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,920
If you recall one of the previous,

1537
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,440
or one of our conferences,

1538
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,780
the fact that we did an internet survey,

1539
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:28,400
had to shut down the response engine

1540
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,400
because it was so much, or there was so much interest

1541
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,760
in the GameStop loyalty program.

1542
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,160
Ours will have different rewards.

1543
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:39,300
It won't be purely a markdown program

1544
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:42,200
that gives discounts once you reach a certain threshold.

1545
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:45,480
It will also have unique rewards like tickets to shows

1546
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:49,060
and early entrances to midnight launch, et cetera.

1547
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:51,680
So we think that builds on what they have

1548
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:52,720
for Micromania now.

1549
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:56,680
So the four markets, they didn't really say

1550
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,760
where they're gonna start it,

1551
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:02,680
but I would imagine it's gonna be some pretty random markets

1552
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:03,520
that they're gonna put them in

1553
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,200
because usually it's not their top markets, so.

1554
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,120
I feel like when you're reading a story like this

1555
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:09,680
about GameStop and their programs,

1556
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,800
I should be playing like a song like this.

1557
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:16,640
We can try that.

1558
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,740
Could you try reading the press release again?

1559
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,360
Yes.

1560
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:23,360
So we think that it builds on what we have for Micromania,

1561
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:26,520
but it really adds lots of sophistication,

1562
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:31,480
and consumer insights to monetize that GameStop consumer

1563
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,280
and brings unique rewards

1564
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,960
that only GameStop can bring you.

1565
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,660
Resistance is futile.

1566
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,940
Join us in our rewards program.

1567
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:49,160
Oh yeah.

1568
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,440
All right, seriously though.

1569
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,920
I mean, is there enough here to really get that customer?

1570
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,120
Well, they were as if they needed to stomp out

1571
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:56,280
more of their competitors.

1572
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,720
They're completely vague in that, though,

1573
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,640
so that's the thing is unless I see a sheet

1574
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,160
that says what I'm getting exactly

1575
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,840
and what I have to pay into it to get,

1576
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,120
you know, I'm not exactly sure

1577
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,960
if it's something that I really wanna participate in.

1578
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,200
But hey, if it's like the end of the GameStop cards now

1579
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:15,040
where I pay $15 a year and I get discounts and whatnot,

1580
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,480
I mean, that's kinda cool, I guess.

1581
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,600
And I get a magazine at least.

1582
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,400
I can thumb through it once a month.

1583
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,740
Frisbee in our chat room says,

1584
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:26,520
I am your retailer, get it?

1585
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,800
All right, well, speaking of GameStop

1586
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,840
or whatever store you wanna do,

1587
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:34,760
there are some pre-order bonuses for ModNation Racers.

1588
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,600
As mentioned before, ModNation Racers

1589
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,680
is making its way out to stores in May,

1590
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:41,560
and the date is May 25th, but,

1591
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:43,400
and this has been done with quite a few Sony games,

1592
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,520
if I'm not mistaken, and probably some 360 ones too

1593
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:46,400
I can't think of right now,

1594
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,840
but depending on where you pre-order it

1595
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:50,480
is the bonus you're gonna get.

1596
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,840
And the bonus has to do with the extra kart racers.

1597
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:56,360
Now, if you decide to order from GameStop

1598
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,280
you will get Kratos from God of War,

1599
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:01,760
which I'm sure is gonna be a very popular one.

1600
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,560
But you can also pre-order from Amazon

1601
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:05,960
and you can get either Ratchet or Clank.

1602
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:06,920
I don't know how that works,

1603
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:09,600
if you pick when you use the code or what happens,

1604
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:10,440
but you get Ratchet or Clank.

1605
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:11,840
Maybe you get both.

1606
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:13,360
Maybe you do get both, I don't know.

1607
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:16,360
And then Best Buy, you get Nathan Drake from Uncharted,

1608
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:17,480
which is actually pretty cool.

1609
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,520
He looks like a me, honestly.

1610
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,080
It looks like one of the Wii characters.

1611
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:23,300
When you look at the little picture of Nathan Drake,

1612
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:25,240
honestly, it looks like a little me there,

1613
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:26,920
but that's what it is.

1614
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,780
Kind of the cool, in my opinion,

1615
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:31,360
I do love God of War, don't get me wrong,

1616
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,200
but I think the Uncharted guy's the coolest.

1617
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,680
I think I would get it from Best Buy

1618
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,580
just to get Nathan Drake, so.

1619
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,800
Now, I'm sure at some point

1620
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,760
they're all gonna be microtransactions

1621
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,160
on the Sony marketplace anyway,

1622
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:45,580
but if you wanna cut that corner

1623
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:47,220
you can do the pre-order there.

1624
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:52,220
By the way, also, you do get some type of mystery mod package

1625
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:54,100
when you pre-order the game.

1626
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:57,600
You get pictures, and you get other accessories

1627
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:00,480
to outfit your racer, and yep,

1628
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,700
you don't know exactly what stuff you're getting

1629
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:04,860
until you input the code.

1630
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:07,740
It's kind of one of those mystery pins at Disneyland,

1631
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:09,140
but that's what it is.

1632
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:11,420
So, could be interesting.

1633
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,060
Any interest in ModNation Racers?

1634
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:17,080
You gonna run out and get this game, day one?

1635
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:19,060
I'm not sure, I have it on order,

1636
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:21,420
but I'm not sure if I'm gonna pick it up right away.

1637
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:23,300
It looks neat, but I just have a feeling

1638
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:26,380
it's not gonna be as good as Little Big Planet.

1639
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:28,540
And that's really, they're trying to get us to think

1640
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:30,400
that it's gonna be Little Big Planet,

1641
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,900
you know, the kart racing game.

1642
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:36,380
No, that's not what it's gonna be,

1643
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:38,140
but it'll be pretty cool.

1644
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:40,660
I have to admit, I'm kind of curious about the game

1645
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:42,500
because I do really like the kart racing games.

1646
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:45,460
Like, I really like, of course, you know, Mario Kart,

1647
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:47,580
and I like, you know, those types of games.

1648
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:49,700
But yeah, I didn't get into the beta.

1649
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,040
I wish I would have just played the beta

1650
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,380
to see if it was good or not.

1651
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:55,380
I unfortunately got into the beta, but I never played it.

1652
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:57,540
Which I can't believe I forgot to mention

1653
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:58,380
during my gaming week,

1654
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:00,540
because we were too busy talking about bad games.

1655
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:02,940
But one game I did play this week was the blur beta.

1656
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:04,720
Finally decided to give that a try

1657
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,420
and give that a go, the blur beta.

1658
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:08,720
And I had a lot of problems connecting to a race.

1659
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:09,800
So when I was playing it the first time,

1660
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,880
I could not get into a race.

1661
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,700
But I went in, I just waited a couple hours

1662
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:15,120
and went in later and it worked just fine.

1663
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:17,560
And we actually played a couple races, just Alan watched.

1664
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:18,580
And it was really pretty.

1665
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:19,420
It was nice looking.

1666
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:20,260
I thought it looked amazing.

1667
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:21,620
Yeah, the graphics are really good.

1668
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:23,740
And you know, I had a lot of fun

1669
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:25,940
because, you know, this one random guy

1670
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:27,360
and I kept targeting each other.

1671
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,780
Like, we kept randomly passing each other and stuff.

1672
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:30,620
So I had fun with blur.

1673
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:31,900
I definitely want to pick up that full game

1674
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:32,740
when it comes out.

1675
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:34,580
Yeah, they leaked out the beta for that.

1676
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:35,420
What's that?

1677
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:37,280
So the beta got leaked out for that.

1678
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:38,320
How's that work?

1679
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,900
It's like a demo on a Xbox slot,

1680
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:43,600
or not Xbox Live, like a Xbox marketplace.

1681
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,760
Basically, you just copy it to your hard drive and run it.

1682
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:46,340
Really?

1683
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:46,840
Yeah.

1684
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:47,740
They did the same thing in Halo.

1685
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:49,540
Do you have to have a modded Xbox to do that, though?

1686
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:50,240
I don't think so.

1687
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:51,260
Really?

1688
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:52,140
Interesting.

1689
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:53,540
Well, I have some codes.

1690
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:55,420
Maybe I'll give those away later in the show.

1691
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:56,260
I don't know.

1692
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:58,900
Do any chatters want a blur beta code?

1693
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:00,460
I'll give some away later, if so.

1694
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:01,260
We'll do that.

1695
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:01,740
Why not?

1696
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:08,180
SSJ100Matt says, the soundboard works great in blur.

1697
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:10,540
Because, you know, he has the soundboard with the Duke Nukem

1698
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:11,460
stuff and everything.

1699
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:12,460
I don't know how he's doing it.

1700
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:15,140
He's patching it through the 360 voice thing somehow.

1701
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:18,380
And yeah, he can play all these random things he's playing.

1702
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:20,260
So if anyone in chat wants a blur beta code,

1703
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:21,260
I'll give some away later.

1704
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:22,920
Maybe I'll give them away during Listless.

1705
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,420
Because they sent me three others.

1706
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,660
And I know at least, I know Alan's going to want one.

1707
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:28,080
But I can give the other two away.

1708
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:29,620
So I'll give those away to listeners.

1709
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:30,980
Why not?

1710
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:33,940
Oh, and the chat room's saying, please, sure, yay.

1711
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:36,580
OK, I will give them away to random voters

1712
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:38,280
in our Listless event later tonight.

1713
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:39,460
So stay tuned.

1714
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:40,260
Stay tuned.

1715
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:44,420
OK, meanwhile, let's get into some, what, release dates?

1716
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:45,700
Are we ready for release dates?

1717
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:47,080
All right, let's do release dates.

1718
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:49,580
All right, this week, there's some decent stuff coming out.

1719
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:51,980
But let's start with some stuff that's not quite

1720
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:53,240
what you may be looking for.

1721
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:56,500
But hey, you've got people that you know that are kids

1722
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:57,820
and stuff, right?

1723
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:00,120
Zuzu Pets, yes, the crazy thing that they

1724
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:03,940
were selling during the holiday that went like crazy.

1725
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:09,780
Little hamsters now coming from Activision to the Nintendo DS.

1726
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:12,540
In fact, you can actually snag one with a little baby hamster

1727
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:14,980
that's blue and yellow.

1728
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:17,420
That's one sick hamster.

1729
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:19,500
How to Train Your Dragon coming out,

1730
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:20,900
tying in with the new movie.

1731
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:24,780
And that's going to be on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii,

1732
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:27,380
DS, and I believe, PSP.

1733
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:32,140
Bakugan Battle Trainer, the sequel to the marble battling

1734
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:34,180
game.

1735
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:35,820
That's going to be coming out to DS.

1736
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:38,900
MotoGP 0910.

1737
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:40,340
I guess they're kind of combining years,

1738
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:42,300
because they didn't have one come out last year.

1739
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:45,940
That'll be coming out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

1740
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:49,740
Just Cause 2 coming out on PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360

1741
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:50,540
this week.

1742
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:52,700
Looks like a pretty fun game.

1743
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:56,780
Red Steel 2, guaranteed to be better than the first one.

1744
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:59,580
Coming out on the Wii, does require Wii Motion Plus.

1745
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:02,500
So you can also pick up the Wii Motion Plus bundle

1746
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,180
for an extra $10.

1747
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:09,380
And saves you $9 off the cost of Wii Motion Plus,

1748
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:11,060
if you don't have it.

1749
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:15,980
My Pet Chimp coming out to Nintendo DS from 505 Games.

1750
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:19,180
505 Games, I may add, was also the company

1751
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:21,060
that put out that really crappy baby game

1752
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:23,860
that I put on my Twitter.

1753
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:26,300
They may be a good candidate to hit up for the president cat.

1754
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:27,740
Yes, I retweeted that.

1755
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:30,180
What the hell was that?

1756
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:32,880
It's an actual baby doll thing or something, right?

1757
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,420
That's the special edition, yes.

1758
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:38,260
You can buy it with a, it's basically a,

1759
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:40,740
it comes with a holster for your Wii

1760
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:42,420
that you attach to any baby doll.

1761
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:43,620
But this one does come with a baby doll.

1762
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:45,000
It looks like an umbilical cord.

1763
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,480
And you play these little mini games,

1764
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,620
like feeding the baby and whatnot.

1765
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:52,460
It's just funny though, because the baby doll

1766
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:54,860
that comes with the little special edition

1767
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:56,260
has a lazy eye.

1768
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:59,060
So it looks funny.

1769
01:07:59,060 --> 01:08:00,420
Anyways, imagine Jim is.

1770
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:02,060
What happens if you shake the baby?

1771
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:04,020
Not that you should do that, that's not funny.

1772
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:04,860
But what if I want to?

1773
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:06,300
I don't know.

1774
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:07,840
There's, I don't know if you read that,

1775
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,180
like the actual page or whatever,

1776
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:11,940
but he was tasked with putting powder on the baby

1777
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:15,040
and they told him to stop, but he kept doing it anyways,

1778
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:16,300
covering the baby in powder.

1779
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,140
That's funny.

1780
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:18,140
I think if you tried to play WarioWare

1781
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:20,820
with the baby peripheral, that might be a lot of fun.

1782
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:23,060
No, what you need to do though,

1783
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:25,680
is you use the baby peripheral with other games.

1784
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:26,520
Like, you know.

1785
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:27,340
Yeah, that's what he's saying.

1786
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:29,540
Play WarioWare with the baby peripheral.

1787
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:31,620
Aim the A button.

1788
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:34,180
I feel like Wii Sports, like baseball

1789
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:35,760
or something like that.

1790
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:37,020
You're bad.

1791
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:38,900
That would be awesome.

1792
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:39,900
Now there's a YouTube.

1793
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:41,220
Now we need to find the baby game

1794
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:43,420
just to do that for YouTube.

1795
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:44,860
And G. Ditz in our chat room

1796
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:46,820
makes the mandatory South Park reference.

1797
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:49,820
South Park reference, sorry, I'm eating too.

1798
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:51,080
Kick the baby, boop.

1799
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:55,500
Cabela's Monster Bunk, or Monster Bunk?

1800
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,120
Yes, it's a giant bunk bed.

1801
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,620
No, Monster Buck Hunter,

1802
01:08:59,620 --> 01:09:01,520
because it's a deer hunting game,

1803
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:02,780
comes with a gun.

1804
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:05,380
Oh yeah, perfect for the redneck, can ya?

1805
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:08,940
Rooms, the first building,

1806
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:13,680
coming out from Konami on the Wii and DS.

1807
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:16,060
Shimagami Tensei, Strange Journey,

1808
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:18,460
coming out on DS as well.

1809
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:22,860
Disney's Stitch Jam, kind of a music platformer game,

1810
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:24,760
coming out also on the DS.

1811
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:28,160
Settler 7, Paths to a Kingdom,

1812
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:30,640
coming out on PC from Ubisoft.

1813
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:33,060
Yes, with really crappy DRM.

1814
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:35,340
Hoop, or was it,

1815
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:38,300
Hall of Fame Ultimate Hoops Challenge.

1816
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:40,260
It's a generic basketball game

1817
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:43,060
trying to cash in on the NBA Jam franchise,

1818
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:45,340
and it looks like crap.

1819
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:46,180
That was quick,

1820
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:47,700
because NBA Jam was just announced

1821
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:48,900
a couple months ago, wasn't it?

1822
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:51,220
Well, this game's been around for a while.

1823
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:53,100
They were just trying to put out a basketball game

1824
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:56,940
with Larry Bird in it, it's interesting.

1825
01:09:56,940 --> 01:10:00,180
And let's see, this is an accessory though,

1826
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:03,740
but the Nyko Wand, they're gonna be doing the action pack.

1827
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:06,020
You remember the Nyko Wand's like the third party controller

1828
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:09,360
that actually, you can kind of move the buttons on it.

1829
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:12,100
So you can plug it in with this gun attachment,

1830
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:14,260
it actually has a physical button for the trigger

1831
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:17,020
instead of a trigger that pushes the B button

1832
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:18,340
on the bottom of the gun.

1833
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:20,740
And then coming out a week from now,

1834
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:22,960
America's Test Kitchen, Let's Get Cooking,

1835
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:23,960
coming from Nintendo.

1836
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:25,300
Let's be honest here, folks,

1837
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:27,140
this is really just them repackaging

1838
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:29,180
that stupid learn to cook game

1839
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:31,720
that they put out a couple years ago.

1840
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:34,980
It looks exactly the same, I don't know.

1841
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:36,940
And then the better game of the two,

1842
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:41,660
WarioWare DIY will be coming out on Sunday.

1843
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:44,420
And to go with those,

1844
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:48,520
the Nintendo DSi XL in Bronz and Burgundy.

1845
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:51,800
Perfect for your Pokemon adventures

1846
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,620
and your little Pokeball walking trainer.

1847
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:59,380
They should really just call it Bronz and Ron Burgundy.

1848
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:00,980
Oh boy.

1849
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:03,480
Oh, how did I, oh wait, no never mind.

1850
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:06,540
That comes out next week, or the week after next.

1851
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:07,940
All right, what, what does?

1852
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:10,100
Oh, free running, that's kind of neat.

1853
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:11,160
What is free running?

1854
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:13,040
Like parkour, like Mirror's Edge.

1855
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,220
Oh, okay, that's kind of cool.

1856
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:15,740
Except not as cool.

1857
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:18,440
All right, let me get into some Japanese release dates

1858
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:19,620
and tell you what's coming overseas

1859
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:22,360
on the Xbox 360 on March 25th.

1860
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:24,960
Chaos Head Love Choo Choo comes out.

1861
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:25,980
Yes, that's the name of the game.

1862
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:27,660
I'm trying to figure out what the hell this is.

1863
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:29,960
It looks like a dating sim or something, I don't know.

1864
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:31,880
Every time I just see these anime girls

1865
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:34,460
and a bunch of text, I assume it's a dating sim.

1866
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:36,860
So that's what I'm gonna call this game.

1867
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:38,780
Another game coming out that does not look

1868
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:42,820
like a dating sim is Hokuto Musou comes out.

1869
01:11:42,820 --> 01:11:46,940
And this is a punch and kick type of game.

1870
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:48,980
I don't know if they have this out in America.

1871
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:52,340
I'm trying to think if there's a localized version of it.

1872
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:53,700
I don't know, for some reason it looks very

1873
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:55,860
like Fist of the North Star-ish to me.

1874
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:57,540
It's something Warriors.

1875
01:11:57,540 --> 01:11:58,380
It might, is it Dynasty?

1876
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:01,260
Well, wait a second, what's it, what is it?

1877
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:02,780
Oh, it's yeah, it's the Fist of the North Star

1878
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:04,260
Dynasty Warriors game.

1879
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:05,260
Oh, yeah.

1880
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:08,260
Gomi, I actually identified that, woo hoo.

1881
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:10,260
And let's see, what else is coming out

1882
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:15,260
on the PlayStation 3, the God of War trilogy,

1883
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:18,120
as well as God of War 3 makes its way out to Japan as well.

1884
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:20,860
So they get their versions not that long after we did.

1885
01:12:20,860 --> 01:12:23,940
And Hokuto Musou also comes out over there.

1886
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:28,620
They also get Pachipata 15, Super Umi Monogatari

1887
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:31,140
in Okinawa 2 comes out as well.

1888
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:32,060
Rawr, rawr.

1889
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,580
Comes out over there from Irem.

1890
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:37,260
And it's a gambling game.

1891
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:39,340
I guess it's some type of, I don't know if that's

1892
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:41,840
like pachinko games or what the hell else it is there.

1893
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,860
So there's that.

1894
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:45,960
That is out on the PlayStation 3.

1895
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:49,300
And on the Nintendo Wii, Silent Hill Shattered Memories

1896
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:50,840
gets its release in Japan.

1897
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:53,460
So if you wanna run and open doors and stuff,

1898
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:54,960
that is coming out on the Nintendo Wii.

1899
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,100
It's also coming out on the PlayStation 2.

1900
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:01,680
The Nintendo DS gets a variety of different games this week,

1901
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:05,020
like some type of phonics game and a wrestling game,

1902
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:07,400
but nothing that really big that's worth talking about,

1903
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,240
to be honest.

1904
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:12,740
But the Sony PSP gets Burst Error, Eve the First.

1905
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:14,540
And I don't know what that game is.

1906
01:13:14,540 --> 01:13:18,420
So that looks like a little, I guess,

1907
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:20,380
oh, it's a sequel to a PC game

1908
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:22,080
from the mid-90s, Burst Error.

1909
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,380
That's what this is.

1910
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:25,980
And they've turned it into Chicks with Guns

1911
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:27,560
and Abnormally Large Boobies.

1912
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:29,400
There you go, look at that screenshot right there.

1913
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:31,240
Big, big boobies.

1914
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:34,680
And also coming out on the Sony PSP,

1915
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:37,600
Prinny 2, Tokuyugi Akasuki No Pants.

1916
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:42,040
That's right, No Pants is in the title.

1917
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:43,820
Daisaku Ensi, and I'm pretty sure

1918
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:46,240
that's I Wanna Be the King Part 2.

1919
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:47,580
Yes, it is.

1920
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:49,760
Prinny 2 comes out this week.

1921
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:50,980
Very nice.

1922
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:53,340
Well, joining us in studio just in time,

1923
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:56,580
say hello to Dark Sakura, or you're muted.

1924
01:13:56,580 --> 01:13:57,580
Now you can, now you can roar.

1925
01:13:57,580 --> 01:13:59,540
What the heck you mute me for?

1926
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:01,460
Well, cause I didn't want the mic picking up sound

1927
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:02,300
when you weren't here.

1928
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:03,820
I didn't want Shermie to jump up on your chair

1929
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:05,860
and go, meow, roar.

1930
01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:09,980
Shermie is too freaking fat to jump up.

1931
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:13,980
And by the way, I'm still burning from the horseradish.

1932
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:15,980
I attended my first Seder tonight.

1933
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:17,220
Oh, did you have fun?

1934
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:18,060
It was a lot of fun.

1935
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:19,220
It was all chicks.

1936
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:20,380
It was a woman's Seder.

1937
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:20,900
Oh, I see.

1938
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:22,540
So it was very estrogen-y.

1939
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:23,380
OK.

1940
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:25,140
Are you all in the same cycle now?

1941
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:26,760
I don't know, but the food was good.

1942
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:27,900
There was chocolate.

1943
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:29,020
Well, of course, with a bunch of women,

1944
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:30,720
of course there's going to be good food.

1945
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,180
Oh, it was fantastic.

1946
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:34,660
And I brought the Nada Shovets.

1947
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:35,180
All right.

1948
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:37,100
It was like, we didn't tell anyone to bring the wine.

1949
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:37,820
Bring the wine.

1950
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:38,420
OK.

1951
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:40,380
Do you want to do UK release dates, or?

1952
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:41,140
Yeah, I can.

1953
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:42,540
You want to do UK release dates?

1954
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:43,180
Because we're ready.

1955
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:43,860
We're ready for you.

1956
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:45,540
Look, I had everything up already.

1957
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:47,500
You got here just in time for your first story.

1958
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:48,580
How do you like that?

1959
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:50,540
Because we didn't have you slated for anything earlier,

1960
01:14:50,540 --> 01:14:52,580
but you got here just in time for your first story.

1961
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:55,100
Did you want to talk about your gaming week real quick?

1962
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:56,740
Gaming week?

1963
01:14:56,740 --> 01:14:58,700
I just assumed Star Trek Online and Peggle.

1964
01:14:58,700 --> 01:14:59,620
That's what I told the listeners.

1965
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:02,140
Well, no, I didn't play Peggle at all, actually.

1966
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:03,740
I did play Star Trek Online, and I

1967
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:05,480
was about to start Final Fantasy II,

1968
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:09,740
except I think I got a phone call, because it's on my phone.

1969
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:10,660
Oh.

1970
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:11,580
I got it for iPhone.

1971
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:13,580
Damn those phone calls interrupting your game.

1972
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:14,860
I got it for iPhone.

1973
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:22,980
And then Dan was playing Gauntlet, like on the NES.

1974
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:23,900
No, on the Genesis.

1975
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:24,940
He was playing Genesis Gauntlet.

1976
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:25,440
Awesome.

1977
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:26,860
You missed it earlier in the show.

1978
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:29,420
Alan and I played Double Dragon on the Xbox this week,

1979
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:31,300
and we think it's the most horrible arcade

1980
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:32,360
game in existence.

1981
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:34,900
And one of those games just kind of sucks.

1982
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:37,620
But Dan came in here and yelled at us,

1983
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:39,700
because he thinks Double Dragon's awesome.

1984
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:41,660
He would.

1985
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:44,500
All right, UK release dates, Dark Soccer, just in time.

1986
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:45,340
What week is this?

1987
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:47,700
The 21st through the 27th, huh?

1988
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:53,340
OK, on the 24th, Game Room, Xbox 360.

1989
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:54,780
God, why do they keep changing the date?

1990
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:59,280
BlazBlue Calamity Trigger, Clash of the Titans, Echo Shift.

1991
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:00,620
That's actually a cool name.

1992
01:16:00,620 --> 01:16:04,620
Infinite Space, Just Cause 2, Pokemon Heart

1993
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:07,940
Gold and Soul Silver, whatever.

1994
01:16:07,940 --> 01:16:12,700
Well, you know, OK, how different

1995
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:13,820
can they do a Pokemon game?

1996
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:14,420
Please tell me.

1997
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:16,220
Because you have the walking trainer this time,

1998
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:17,100
but it's a Pokeball.

1999
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:18,040
I had one of those.

2000
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:18,540
Yeah?

2001
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:20,900
I had one of those, and that's when that's all it was.

2002
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:23,700
And it was yellow, and it was in black and white.

2003
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:26,540
But this one has Pokemans in it as you walk.

2004
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:27,820
Mine had Pokemans in it.

2005
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:28,900
That's right.

2006
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:32,020
You grow your Mudkips by walking around the block.

2007
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:33,420
Mine had Pokeman in it.

2008
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:35,300
It had Pikachu.

2009
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:37,860
So, eh.

2010
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:38,700
Where am I?

2011
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:40,260
I would play the MMO, though.

2012
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:43,020
And there's a Racket Sports Party.

2013
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:45,180
I would play the Pokemon MMO, and I

2014
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:47,140
would play Pokemon Snap 2 if they ever made it.

2015
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:48,340
Would you play it in a box?

2016
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:49,380
Would you play it with a fox?

2017
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:52,060
I would play it on a train, and I would play it in the rain.

2018
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:54,420
Could you, would you, with a mouse?

2019
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:56,780
Shut the fuck up and read the dates.

2020
01:16:56,780 --> 01:17:04,060
Resonance of Fate, Red Steel 2, Rugu Attack, Rugu Twisted

2021
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:09,340
Towers, Star Wars The Force Unleashed Ultimate Sith

2022
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:14,940
Edition, Die Seidler 7, Warriors Legends of Troy.

2023
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:17,340
God, they're just putting everything right together.

2024
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:18,700
I may as well do next week, too.

2025
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:21,100
Shoot, Grand Theft Auto IV, or whatever.

2026
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:23,100
But again, or is that like a price reduction?

2027
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:24,020
It's a loss in the damn.

2028
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:24,700
I think it's a.

2029
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:25,820
Oh, gotcha.

2030
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:27,700
By the way, our chat room jumping out here

2031
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:29,420
and screaming some corrections here.

2032
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:30,540
Llama Juice, it's not new.

2033
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:31,820
It's gold and silver.

2034
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:34,580
And Llama Juice says, the game is actually fun.

2035
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:36,860
And Dr. Tetsuya says, you're Pokemans.

2036
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:37,900
Please show us them.

2037
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:40,340
Alpha Kinetagram says, gold kicked ass.

2038
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:41,100
Gold kicked ass.

2039
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:43,380
I thought Pearl was fun until I stopped going to the gym.

2040
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:46,500
Spike McRue says, yeah, but gold and silver were the best.

2041
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,140
Let's be honest.

2042
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:48,900
No, no, no.

2043
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:50,360
I have some friends that are doing.

2044
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:52,260
The pinnacle is Pokemon Snap.

2045
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:54,780
There's this gal on my Twitter friends list,

2046
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:56,080
and I don't know her real well.

2047
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:59,140
I think she runs Gaming Angels, I want to say

2048
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:00,180
is the name of the site.

2049
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:01,700
I hope I got that right.

2050
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:03,900
And she made this tweet that I just found hilarious,

2051
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:05,700
because I kind of could see myself.

2052
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:09,420
She said something like, I'm in line right now waiting

2053
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:10,700
to get the new Pokemon game.

2054
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:11,860
Yeah, I'm 33 years old.

2055
01:18:11,860 --> 01:18:12,360
What?

2056
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:16,560
And I'm like, oh, that must be awkward

2057
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:20,460
to be in the midnight launch line for Pokemon.

2058
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:23,060
My Pokemans let you not show them to me.

2059
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:24,820
But I got to say, there's quite a few people

2060
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:26,660
I know that are playing the new Pokemon game.

2061
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:30,100
I almost, almost want to get it.

2062
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:32,340
But I'm afraid if I do, Alan will break up with me.

2063
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:33,380
He's like, no, I can't.

2064
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:36,020
If you do, I'll disown you, Rob.

2065
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:38,420
Alan, would you break up with me if I got the Pokemon game?

2066
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:38,820
Would you be able to handle it?

2067
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:40,160
I have nothing against Pokemon.

2068
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:40,900
Really?

2069
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:42,320
Do you want to play Pokemon together?

2070
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:45,160
We'll both get the game and then run around the block

2071
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:46,020
and evolve our Pokemon.

2072
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:49,940
Rob, you're such a five-year-old girl.

2073
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:51,940
I'm just kidding, I'm not going to get it.

2074
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:53,180
Oh, but Spyro in chat.

2075
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:55,500
Oh, and Ionotropic I should give credit to first.

2076
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:58,020
A jump in and say, Pokemon pinball rules all.

2077
01:18:58,020 --> 01:18:59,620
Abso-fucking-lutely.

2078
01:18:59,620 --> 01:19:00,580
That was pretty fun.

2079
01:19:00,580 --> 01:19:01,820
That was an amazing game.

2080
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:02,780
A++.

2081
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:03,780
I will sign off on that.

2082
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:05,860
It's still burning from the damn horseradish.

2083
01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:07,780
It's also really kind of hot in the studio right now.

2084
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:09,220
Well, you know, I've got this thing

2085
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:10,940
that I used to tie the curtains back with, Rob,

2086
01:19:10,940 --> 01:19:12,100
so you could actually have airflow.

2087
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:12,460
Hi.

2088
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:13,860
By the way, I was going to ask you when you got here.

2089
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:15,900
Were you able to do the orange scarf, after all?

2090
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:17,340
Or was that not finished?

2091
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:18,900
All right, that's all right.

2092
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:19,700
I've had no time.

2093
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:20,440
No, I understand.

2094
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:21,060
I understand.

2095
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:24,220
I just want to, before I talk about PAX East in part B,

2096
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:25,340
I want to make sure I have.

2097
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:27,260
But I'll try to get this monstrosity finished.

2098
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:29,980
Well, I leave on Tuesday night.

2099
01:19:29,980 --> 01:19:31,740
So I'm good.

2100
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:32,420
Oh, all right.

2101
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:32,940
Oh, no.

2102
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:34,380
I don't think I can get it done.

2103
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:35,420
I'll ship it to you.

2104
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:36,420
All right.

2105
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:40,060
Anyhow, let's move on with some more crash, bang, boom.

2106
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:41,820
There's chaos going on in the studio.

2107
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:43,340
Let's get back to some gaming news.

2108
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:45,300
We have a couple more stories than the classic Game

2109
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:46,700
of the Week, Loki.

2110
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:51,460
Yeah, so with Game Room coming out very soon, actually,

2111
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:53,580
it's interesting to find out that there's actually

2112
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:56,660
going to be some achievements tied in with Game Room.

2113
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:58,160
I thought that they were just going

2114
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:02,700
to be tied in with actual games, but apparently it's Game Room.

2115
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:05,500
There's going to be 1,000 achievement points to be had

2116
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:08,620
and 56 achievements altogether.

2117
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:13,380
Apparently, you get points every three medals that you earn.

2118
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:14,820
There's even some points, I guess,

2119
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:18,540
for spending time in the arcade, 36 hours total.

2120
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:23,020
So interesting that they have that.

2121
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:26,400
I don't know.

2122
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,700
What do you think about achievements in Game Room?

2123
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:32,540
Well, it's cool that they are doing more than just the 200.

2124
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:34,180
I think a lot of people are bummed

2125
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:37,300
that they're not doing achievement points per game,

2126
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:38,980
but I think that would be a bit much.

2127
01:20:38,980 --> 01:20:41,620
Like, to do so many achievement points per game,

2128
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:42,860
I think it would be too much.

2129
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:44,860
Especially with my whole rock band analogy,

2130
01:20:44,860 --> 01:20:46,220
the game is Game Room.

2131
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:48,180
It's just the classic games are the songs.

2132
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:50,340
You know, they're the microtransactions.

2133
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:52,100
It does seem like, though, if you actually

2134
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:54,220
read through the list of achievements, most of them

2135
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:57,220
are driven by the medals that you win

2136
01:20:57,220 --> 01:20:58,720
from playing the classic games.

2137
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:00,220
So you're still going to have to have

2138
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:01,600
a variety of classic games in order

2139
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:02,760
to get all the achievements.

2140
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:05,060
But I think it's pretty cool that they allowed

2141
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:06,620
them to bump it up to 1,000.

2142
01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:09,620
I mean, you're looking at a full game.

2143
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:11,500
Honestly, it's just kind of a different type

2144
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,180
of method of getting it out there.

2145
01:21:13,180 --> 01:21:13,740
Definitely.

2146
01:21:13,740 --> 01:21:15,360
And some of the achievements in there,

2147
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:16,740
they have choose for themes.

2148
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:18,340
Like, place the theme in your arcade.

2149
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:22,340
They have one for placing five unique themes in your arcade.

2150
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:23,740
You know, theme your entire arcade

2151
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:27,340
with unique themes, your mascot, props, visitors.

2152
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:31,240
It seems like some of those are really easy achievements,

2153
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:33,900
unless you have to do something to earn those decorations.

2154
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:35,540
Well, the decorations, the thing that

2155
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:38,620
worries me about the decorations is you have to buy those.

2156
01:21:38,620 --> 01:21:40,780
Well, didn't they say that some you would get for buying

2157
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:44,500
game on release day baby but still it's

2158
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:48,820
buying something you know to me I do my

2159
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:53,280
buying achievement points hmm in a way

2160
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:56,340
you are if you don't buy any games for

2161
01:21:56,340 --> 01:21:58,740
game room you can't get those metal

2162
01:21:58,740 --> 01:22:00,460
based achievements all I take it back

2163
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:02,780
you could do it using the quarter method

2164
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:04,140
but you're going to have to spend money

2165
01:22:04,140 --> 01:22:06,500
money one way or the other I'll check it

2166
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:11,500
out it'll be interesting to see I don't

2167
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:12,540
know how much I'm not really gonna play

2168
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:14,560
of it though I'm not gonna lie I'm super

2169
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:16,040
excited about game room I'm all about

2170
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:18,260
the classic games but remember I do have

2171
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:20,460
a couple rules my number one rule is I

2172
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:22,420
will not buy a game that they've already

2173
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:24,560
released on Xbox live arcade so don't be

2174
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,460
looking for me and scramble or tempest

2175
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:28,460
because I already have those games I'm

2176
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:30,120
not buying them again and getting game

2177
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:32,220
room I don't care how pretty it is

2178
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:35,100
anyhow one more story for you guys

2179
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:37,020
before we get to the classic game of the

2180
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:38,340
week and this has to do with something I

2181
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:39,460
actually mentioned during the release

2182
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:41,060
dates a couple weeks ago actually I

2183
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:42,460
think it was last week on the

2184
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:44,420
PlayStation 3 this week they released in

2185
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:46,740
Japan something called torn well guess

2186
01:22:46,740 --> 01:22:49,460
what apparently Famitsu is reporting

2187
01:22:49,460 --> 01:22:51,700
that shops in Japan are selling out of

2188
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,420
this the standalone version of the torn

2189
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:56,740
DVR peripheral although I guess the

2190
01:22:56,740 --> 01:22:58,500
PlayStation threes that have it built in

2191
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:00,020
there's still some of those available on

2192
01:23:00,020 --> 01:23:01,460
shelves but this thing is selling like

2193
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:03,860
crazy now what is torn it's basically a

2194
01:23:03,860 --> 01:23:06,980
DVR it's a DVR attachment imagine like

2195
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:08,580
they sold TiVo that you would attach to

2196
01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:10,460
your PlayStation 3 that's what torn is

2197
01:23:10,460 --> 01:23:12,980
it's a DVR attachment for your ps3 and

2198
01:23:12,980 --> 01:23:15,440
apparently it's selling out just so you

2199
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:17,300
know don't bother importing it it will

2200
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:19,380
not work in America it's only capable of

2201
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:21,300
doing the Japanese terrestrial yes it's

2202
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:25,040
on the same system but the problem is is

2203
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,940
that I guess torn also downloads a lot

2204
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:28,540
of programming information and it's not

2205
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:29,620
going to do that for the American

2206
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:32,060
channels you know don't bother importing

2207
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:34,180
that but think about how cool it would

2208
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:35,420
be if they would just release that

2209
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:37,260
frickin thing over here imagine it

2210
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:39,300
imagine if they release TiVo for your

2211
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:41,020
PlayStation 3 would you buy it I would

2212
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:43,700
absolutely I don't have DVR on Comcast

2213
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:45,260
because I don't think the DVR that

2214
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:47,260
Comcast offers is that great to be to be

2215
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:49,060
honest I like how TiVo will do the

2216
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:50,500
recommended shows and all that stuff too

2217
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:55,100
and the the DVR on Comcast is kind of

2218
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:56,940
clunky for me I have something that does

2219
01:23:56,940 --> 01:23:59,860
that it's called um the internet and

2220
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:02,100
downloading and watch it yeah I know I

2221
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:04,620
know and now you know I'm ready I'm

2222
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:06,020
actually ready to cancel our cable and

2223
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:07,180
get a different internet provider because

2224
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:08,860
I will dance on them to watch this TV

2225
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:10,260
but we hooked up a computer in the front

2226
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:14,780
room and watch Hulu I have a decent rate

2227
01:24:14,780 --> 01:24:16,940
going on right now I have a special but

2228
01:24:16,940 --> 01:24:18,860
I seriously think when the six months is

2229
01:24:18,860 --> 01:24:20,820
over I'm gonna just cancel the TV I

2230
01:24:20,820 --> 01:24:22,940
don't ever watch it like he watched

2231
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:25,340
Casino Royale today for like a couple

2278
01:26:35,340 --> 01:26:36,660
segment on our show we like to do this

2279
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:38,700
every week we take a trip down memory

2280
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:40,620

01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:42,140
the way for popping in and get us

2282
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:46,740
talking about drag queens all right I

2283
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:49,380

01:26:49,380 --> 01:26:53,540

actor for gots you in this was Michael

2316
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:21,220
all these are more likely than we are

2317
01:28:21,220 --> 01:28:24,780
Voltron strange so it's all the fault of

2318
01:28:24,780 --> 01:28:26,580

American voice acting though because you

2322
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:40,420

I was like these are voices I did I know

2324
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:45,580
from my youth so this game was like

2325
01:28:45,580 --> 01:28:47,500
that's so cool and also my favorite

2326
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:49,300
Japanese voice actor was gots his voice

2327
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:50,700
in Japanese version is this like a

2328
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:53,780
Silent Hill kind of game no okay I let

2329
01:28:53,780 --> 01:28:55,380
me let me get back to you all right

2330
01:28:55,380 --> 01:28:59,540
please please berserk is a dark fantasy

2331
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:04,660
manga in Japan it's very graphic very

2332
01:29:04,660 --> 01:29:11,380
graphic very violent it's cuts mistakes

2333
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:12,700
back here giving comments like look at

2334
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:14,700
the size of that sword it's a nice sword

2335
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:18,220
but the game is sort of an adventure RPG

2336
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:19,940
hack and slash type of thing it's really

2337
01:29:19,940 --> 01:29:22,420
a big hack and slash it's see how much

2338
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:24,140
blood you can splatter and how angry you

2339
01:29:24,140 --> 01:29:27,420
can make gots you so anyway it's based

2340
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:31,540
off of a manga and it's set for anyone

2341
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:33,900
who is a fan of berserk I've read a

2342
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:35,660
whole bunch of the manga it's set

2343
01:29:35,660 --> 01:29:38,080
between volume 22 and 23 of the manga

2344
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:41,300
it's set after the anime series the

2345
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:45,220
anime is I think a 26 episode series and

2346
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:48,340
it did my the anime followed the first

2347
01:29:48,340 --> 01:29:49,780
arc of the manga which was the whole

2348
01:29:49,780 --> 01:29:52,780
Taka no Dan thing everybody in chat by

2349
01:29:52,780 --> 01:29:54,020
the way is saying dark is an

2350
01:29:54,020 --> 01:29:55,820
understatement dark is totally an

2351
01:29:55,820 --> 01:30:01,020
understatement it's like it makes

2352
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:03,300
Tarantino movies look like Cartoon

01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:04,900
Network there's like this whole scene in

2354
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:06,460
the manga where they go into this cave

2355
01:30:06,460 --> 01:30:08,900

were tend to be part of the sacrifice

2408
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:13,620
but they escaped there are similarities

2409
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:15,300
between that and Final Fantasy 13 I just

2410
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:18,860
want to know no I know there's nothing

2411
01:32:18,860 --> 01:32:22,140
nothing which is a bummer because I wish

2412
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:24,060
vanille was in the game Jamie's talking

2413
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:27,060
about that's that's the only bummer yes

2414
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:30,180
you can finish so anyway um so this is

2415
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:32,820
this is a side story but it from what I

2416
01:32:32,820 --> 01:32:34,420
understand it is considered part of part

2417
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:40,020
of the cannon and so got to somewhere in

2418
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:42,620
the manga got this little elf starts

2419
01:32:42,620 --> 01:32:43,860
following got to around called puck

2420
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:45,780
who's really more like a weird little

2421
01:32:45,780 --> 01:32:48,780
chubby fairy with blue hair but anyway

2422
01:32:48,780 --> 01:32:52,740
and what you call me a blue chubby fairy

2423
01:32:52,740 --> 01:32:56,980
anyway anyway and the whole point is

2424
01:32:56,980 --> 01:32:59,420
that Casca from her ordeal because she

2425
01:32:59,420 --> 01:33:02,900
had a bad time has no memory she acts

2426
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:04,100
like a little child she giggles she

2427
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:06,300
doesn't talk she's just clueless about

2428
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:07,900
the world around her and so it got to

2429
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:09,300
trying to take her to the home of the

2430
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:10,460
elves to get her brain cured or

2431
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:13,820
something and so he hears about the

2432
01:33:13,820 --> 01:33:16,820
Mandragora which for anyone who knows

2433
01:33:16,820 --> 01:33:18,460
what what the legend of the Mandrake

2434
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:19,900
route is you know you pick it's like in

2435
01:33:19,900 --> 01:33:21,060
Harry Potter Rob you pick him up the

2436
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:23,140
screen as a grown-up one will make your

2437
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:26,060
head explode or some shit anyway so

2438
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:29,220
sounds like fun so anyway it's you know

2439
01:33:29,220 --> 01:33:30,860
them getting all caught up in this one

2440
01:33:30,860 --> 01:33:33,780
thing because the main bad guy his wife

2441
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:35,540
has the same problem Casca does but it's

2442
01:33:35,540 --> 01:33:38,020
long story I'm not getting onto it this

2443
01:33:38,020 --> 01:33:39,820
is really a game worth playing really is

2444
01:33:39,820 --> 01:33:42,740
a game worth playing it's really fun so

2445
01:33:42,740 --> 01:33:46,700
of course it it it ends gruesome just

2446
01:33:46,700 --> 01:33:48,380
like anything related to berserk ends

2447
01:33:48,380 --> 01:33:54,260
and but it's just really really a fun

2448
01:33:54,260 --> 01:34:01,140
game and like I said there was a another

2449
01:34:01,140 --> 01:34:03,060
version that came out on PlayStation 2

2450
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:07,940
there's also the soundtrack now what's

2451
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:11,060
really cool about this is

2452
01:34:17,540 --> 01:34:20,060
horses was the opening theme song to the

2453
01:34:20,060 --> 01:34:21,860
anime and the guy who did the soundtrack

2454
01:34:21,860 --> 01:34:23,980
for the anime and the opening theme and

2455
01:34:23,980 --> 01:34:28,260
everything did did all the music in the

2456
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:30,620
game and he did a special version of the

2457
01:34:30,620 --> 01:34:33,260
opening song

2458
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:41,740
she did a special version of the of the

2459
01:34:41,740 --> 01:34:45,500
opening so it really this is actually I

2460
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:47,820
think one of the best tie-ins because

2461
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:49,580
you don't really have to me if you've

2462
01:34:49,580 --> 01:34:50,540
been keeping up with the series you

2463
01:34:50,540 --> 01:34:52,220
don't really have to guess about where

2464
01:34:52,220 --> 01:35:05,740
it's gone where the specific

2465
01:35:05,740 --> 01:35:09,780
this is actually one of my favorite

2466
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:19,140
pieces of music ever what what everybody

2467
01:35:19,140 --> 01:35:20,540
from the living room keeps coming in

2468
01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:22,260
here to derail the show Dan is just

2469
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:24,980
waving and tell everybody around tell

2470
01:35:24,980 --> 01:35:27,060
everyone how awesome this game is he

2471
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:30,980
left he left yet chicken but head dessert

2472
01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:37,700
chicken I'm disowning you Peter would

2473
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:39,220
tell you that what happens to chickens

2474
01:35:39,220 --> 01:35:43,020
is something like this dessert game yeah

2475
01:35:43,020 --> 01:35:47,140
but at any rate oh here you next time

2476
01:35:47,140 --> 01:35:48,660
you have a chicken McNugget you always

2477
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:50,020
gets mad at me because I go to the

2478
01:35:50,020 --> 01:35:56,660
startup by lunch meet what the fuck

2479
01:35:56,660 --> 01:36:00,460
bitch you are eating that chicken or I'll

2480
01:36:00,460 --> 01:36:07,780
give it to Eric Joker yes dessert hello

2481
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:10,340
we do a show here it's about on the one

2482
01:36:10,340 --> 01:36:11,740
that was on Dreamcast yes dessert

2483
01:36:11,740 --> 01:36:15,900
sucking was hard as nails it was like

2484
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:17,500
you get to know throughout his odd and

2485
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:19,980
he's like by the way I know you thought

2486
01:36:19,980 --> 01:36:22,100
you were good at 3d action games but you

2487
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:24,740
saw and he'll kill you and kill you and

2488
01:36:24,740 --> 01:36:26,860
kill you and kill you until you finally

2489
01:36:26,860 --> 01:36:28,860
man up enough to beat them the rest of

2490
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:32,740
the game is fucking harder than hell yes

2491
01:36:32,740 --> 01:36:35,900
and the story is a little bit dark no

2492
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:39,100
no berserk saw bright Mary it's very

2493
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:41,420
similar to the story of rape and

2494
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:45,340
insanity and that's just the back story

2495
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:47,060
they had called the game rape and

2496
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:48,820
insanity it would have sold more but

2497
01:36:48,820 --> 01:36:50,340
berserk everybody thinks that's a game

2498
01:36:50,340 --> 01:36:52,460
with a bouncing happy face no electric

2499
01:36:52,460 --> 01:36:55,060
maze it's spelled differently that's

2500
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:57,180
spelled with a Z okay it has a lot of

2501
01:36:57,180 --> 01:37:02,860
also hard as nails anything else chicken

2502
01:37:02,860 --> 01:37:05,460
check it

2503
01:37:06,460 --> 01:37:08,580
Dan was actually right that's pretty

2504
01:37:08,580 --> 01:37:13,180
much how the series ends I have a laser

2505
01:37:13,180 --> 01:37:16,340
disk now I like to berserk so that's

2506
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:20,220
very cool you have your mr. J anyway

2507
01:37:20,220 --> 01:37:23,820
berserk was a series that I was so into

2508
01:37:23,820 --> 01:37:30,660
I loved the anime piss off and give me

2509
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:32,780
I apologize to listeners there's just

2510
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:34,460
insanity going on in the studio tonight

2511
01:37:34,460 --> 01:37:37,700
it's like it it's like our show has the

2512
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:39,180
red ring of death tonight because it's

2513
01:37:39,180 --> 01:37:42,020
the 360 s episode so congratulations

2514
01:37:42,020 --> 01:37:45,980
Dan you broke the show tonight five

2515
01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:49,220
gamerscore all right yeah well I got

2516
01:37:49,220 --> 01:37:52,340
your chicken right here

01:37:52,340 --> 01:37:55,700
there goes no it's in the fridge anyway

2518
01:37:55,700 --> 01:37:58,980
yeah when Dan says that the back story

2519
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:01,540
for for this game is rape and insanity

2520
01:38:01,540 --> 01:38:04,780
he means that literally seriously that's

2521
01:38:04,780 --> 01:38:06,820
how did the TV series ends that's why

2522
01:38:06,820 --> 01:38:11,540
Costco's fucked up so um it's it was a

2523
01:38:11,540 --> 01:38:14,300
really you know what I have to say I was

2524
01:38:14,300 --> 01:38:16,380
surprised that the game came over here

2525
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:18,820
because the anime hadn't been out over

2526
01:38:18,820 --> 01:38:20,140
here they didn't turn the blood into

2527
01:38:20,140 --> 01:38:22,100
sweat or anything no no it was vicious

2528
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:24,900
but they brought the game out over here

2529
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:26,900
and didn't really give any real back

2530
01:38:26,900 --> 01:38:29,180
story to it it was before the anime you

2531
01:38:29,180 --> 01:38:31,380
could only get it I think like in early

2532
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:34,980
fan subs and the manga was all not even

2533
01:38:34,980 --> 01:38:36,020
that I don't even think there were many

2534
01:38:36,020 --> 01:38:38,900
fan translations out at the time so it

2535
01:38:38,900 --> 01:38:41,300
was just like berserk here you go and

2536
01:38:41,300 --> 01:38:43,100
I'm like dude what the hell hey I like

2537
01:38:43,100 --> 01:38:46,900
this and then I I watched some of the

2538
01:38:46,900 --> 01:38:48,260
anime and said to get the Japanese

2539
01:38:48,260 --> 01:38:50,060
version because I really love dudes voice

2540
01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:52,540
Hayashi Nobutoshi is like my favorite

2541
01:38:52,540 --> 01:38:53,980
voice actor ever if for anyone who

2542
01:38:53,980 --> 01:38:55,820
watched Fushigi Yugi he did Tatsuki's

2543
01:38:55,820 --> 01:38:59,820
voice acting and Bathora in Macross 7

2544
01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:01,540
not the singing although he's got an

2545
01:39:01,540 --> 01:39:05,060
amazing singing voice but that's those

2546
01:39:05,060 --> 01:39:09,100
examples oh and he also was um who was

2547
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:10,300

can be thinking about it so we want to

2608

do something Microsoft inspired since

2609
01:41:36,940 --> 01:41:39,340
it's episode 360 so what is Microsoft

2610
01:41:39,340 --> 01:41:41,580
really good at stealing other people's

2611
01:41:41,580 --> 01:41:45,260
ideas and making them better so tonight's

2612
01:41:45,260 --> 01:41:48,420
list list is what great idea should

2613
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:51,820
Microsoft steal next so or the idea that

2614
01:41:51,820 --> 01:41:53,620
Microsoft should steal and make better

2615
01:41:53,620 --> 01:41:56,120

news Loki let's do some rapid quick

2669
01:43:51,260 --> 01:43:53,660
quick news yes so let's start off with

2670
01:43:53,660 --> 01:43:56,980
the release date for crackdown 2 which

2671
01:43:56,980 --> 01:43:59,180
is now being put into one of the most

2672
01:43:59,180 --> 01:44:02,380
dead months of the year July yes it'll

2673
01:44:02,380 --> 01:44:04,900
be coming out July 6 and boy does it

2674
01:44:04,900 --> 01:44:07,780
look awesome the game will be releasing

2675
01:44:07,780 --> 01:44:09,540
in North America on July 6 with Asia

2676
01:44:09,540 --> 01:44:11,380
Australia and New Zealand following on

2677
01:44:11,380 --> 01:44:14,300
July 8th in Europe following on July 9th

2678
01:44:14,300 --> 01:44:16,940
no word on exactly when Japan will be

2679
01:44:16,940 --> 01:44:18,940
receiving the game or any of the Asian

2680
01:44:18,940 --> 01:44:22,340
regions but yeah it looks all sorts of

2681
01:44:22,340 --> 01:44:25,780
awesome one thing that was supposed to

2682
01:44:25,780 --> 01:44:27,620
not be coming out over here apparently

2683
01:44:27,620 --> 01:44:29,940
is Batman Arkham Asylum the game of the

2684
01:44:29,940 --> 01:44:31,380
year edition will indeed be coming out

2685
01:44:31,380 --> 01:44:33,220
over in North America and will also

2686
01:44:33,220 --> 01:44:37,460
feature 3d support as well originally

2687
01:44:37,460 --> 01:44:41,380
they announced that the 3d would be done

2688
01:44:41,380 --> 01:44:43,300
in a way that wouldn't alter the colors

2689
01:44:43,300 --> 01:44:44,780
however I see now in the picture that

2690
01:44:44,780 --> 01:44:47,340
they have the kind of purple and green

2691
01:44:47,340 --> 01:44:50,020
glasses so apparently it's just going to

2692
01:44:50,020 --> 01:44:52,700
be the standard 3d stuff but they'll be

2693
01:44:52,700 --> 01:44:56,620
coming out in the early part of May and

2694
01:44:56,620 --> 01:44:59,020
then finally to coincide with the

2695
01:44:59,020 --> 01:45:01,220
Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker launch

2696
01:45:01,220 --> 01:45:02,980
they're going to be doing a brand new

2697
01:45:02,980 --> 01:45:06,100
PSP bundle it's going to be coming out

2698
01:45:06,100 --> 01:45:09,820
on June 8th and it'll be a greenish PSP

2699
01:45:09,820 --> 01:45:12,380
come with a copy of the game a two

2700
01:45:12,380 --> 01:45:15,300
gigabyte memory sick pro duo and a

2701
01:45:15,300 --> 01:45:18,460
voucher for some unidentified movie

2702
01:45:18,460 --> 01:45:20,940
download as well as an exclusive in-game

2703
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:23,220
item for Peace Walker could it possibly

2704
01:45:23,220 --> 01:45:25,220
be Metal Gear espionage related the

2705
01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:28,260
movie just call it a hunch I don't know

2706
01:45:28,260 --> 01:45:29,980
yes I don't know they don't have a

2707
01:45:29,980 --> 01:45:31,820
Metal Gear movie well you know something

2708
01:45:31,820 --> 01:45:33,300
there could be an anime or something

2709
01:45:33,300 --> 01:45:34,340
right now I guess there isn't one is

2710
01:45:34,340 --> 01:45:36,700
there I don't like James Bond it'll be

2711
01:45:36,700 --> 01:45:38,340
quantum solace or something you know

2712
01:45:38,340 --> 01:45:41,500
something close maybe um and that of

2713
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:45,180
course will be coming out for $200 um

2714
01:45:45,180 --> 01:45:47,660
some news I have for you guys final

2715
01:45:47,660 --> 01:45:50,540
fight double impact I hoping I'm really

2716
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:52,780
really hoping this is also not one of

2717
01:45:52,780 --> 01:45:54,100
those games that I see through road

2718
01:45:54,100 --> 01:45:55,740
color glasses like we were talking about

2719
01:45:55,740 --> 01:45:57,500
earlier in the show but I don't know

2720
01:45:57,500 --> 01:45:58,980
final fight came years after double

2721
01:45:58,980 --> 01:46:00,780
dragons I don't know and besides it also

2722
01:46:00,780 --> 01:46:03,140
has magic sword and I know magic sword

2723
01:46:03,140 --> 01:46:04,980
is still all the Capcom like beat-em-up

2724
01:46:04,980 --> 01:46:06,860
games are pretty awesome well it is

2725
01:46:06,860 --> 01:46:09,140
coming April 14th and 15th depending on

2726
01:46:09,140 --> 01:46:11,220
which story you want Xbox Live gets on

2727
01:46:11,220 --> 01:46:12,820
the 14th and PlayStation Store gets at

2728
01:46:12,820 --> 01:46:14,240
the same we just pointed at Captain

2729
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:16,740
commandos not part of that no but it's

2730
01:46:16,740 --> 01:46:18,500
it's weird because it's final fight and

2731
01:46:18,500 --> 01:46:20,060
magic sword like I can't think of more

2732
01:46:20,060 --> 01:46:21,540
different games like yeah they're running

2733
01:46:21,540 --> 01:46:22,820
on the same end I know but they're still

2734
01:46:22,820 --> 01:46:24,620
like completely different games Loki

2735
01:46:24,620 --> 01:46:26,140
they're not they have nothing in common

2736
01:46:26,140 --> 01:46:28,260
yes the same engine that's all two games

2737
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:29,500
the present one that's the way I look at

2738
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:31,620
it that's fine that's fine so I'm

2739
01:46:31,620 --> 01:46:32,620
looking forward to it if not for nothing

2740
01:46:32,620 --> 01:46:35,500
else for me it's a magic sword featuring

2741
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:37,900
final fight because I I hate how magic

2742
01:46:37,900 --> 01:46:39,340
sword is being understated in this

2743
01:46:39,340 --> 01:46:41,260
release like that I don't know why it

2744
01:46:41,260 --> 01:46:43,940
bugs me I'm just weird would you like to

2745
01:46:43,940 --> 01:46:45,980
buy my namesake that's right you can buy

2746
01:46:45,980 --> 01:46:48,940

01:47:03,980 --> 01:47:05,460
so somebody actually bought that with

2757
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:06,840
the Nintendo system the controllers the

2758
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:09,500
gun all that stuff four thousand one

2759
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:10,700
hundred fifty dollars I don't know if

2760
01:47:10,700 --> 01:47:13,020
they remembered but it wasn't that good

2761
01:47:13,020 --> 01:47:14,420
like I don't know if you ever actually

2762
01:47:14,420 --> 01:47:16,220
played the Rob the robot but it was kind

2763
01:47:16,220 --> 01:47:17,840
of annoying wanted to get one for my

2764
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:19,820
desk and trust me they're a lot cheaper

2765
01:47:19,820 --> 01:47:21,860
than four grand I mean you could get them

2766
01:47:21,860 --> 01:47:23,840
well yeah but these are in pristine

2767
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:26,300
condition who cares and then the control

2768
01:47:26,300 --> 01:47:27,620
I gotta say in the display box and

2769
01:47:27,620 --> 01:47:29,220
everything's pretty cool but it's weird

2770
01:47:29,220 --> 01:47:31,880
to think that that was sitting in some

2771
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:33,820
store that probably got sent it for free

2772
01:47:33,820 --> 01:47:35,780
but yeah if you never played the Rob the

2773
01:47:35,780 --> 01:47:37,460
robot before it was really weird it had

2774
01:47:37,460 --> 01:47:39,440
these little gyro things that would spin

2775
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:41,580
and then you would have to move them on

2776
01:47:41,580 --> 01:47:44,060
to a thing that would push down the

2777
01:47:44,060 --> 01:47:46,020
button on your controller but then they

2778
01:47:46,020 --> 01:47:47,500
would start to lose speed so you have to

2779
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:48,820
pick them up and rev them up again like

2780
01:47:48,820 --> 01:47:51,460
it was kind of annoying yeah um the nest

2781
01:47:51,460 --> 01:47:53,960
that I got was I think I got a nest when

2782
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:55,180
I was little within the first month of

2783
01:47:55,180 --> 01:47:58,260
it coming out so I got the Rob system it

2784
01:47:58,260 --> 01:48:00,100
really wasn't fun at all and it was loud

2785
01:48:00,100 --> 01:48:03,100
it was so loud the sound of it you know

2786
01:48:03,100 --> 01:48:05,080
spinning up the things my friend had one

2787
01:48:05,080 --> 01:48:06,260
of these and I remember we tried to play

2788
01:48:06,260 --> 01:48:07,700
it once it was a little ridiculous yeah

2789
01:48:07,700 --> 01:48:12,300
yeah so not worth forty one fifty okay

2790
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:14,380
all right and one other story for you

2791
01:48:14,380 --> 01:48:16,540
guys pac-man battle royale we talked

2792
01:48:16,540 --> 01:48:17,780
about a couple weeks on the show saying

2793
01:48:17,780 --> 01:48:19,140
it had the worst teaser trailer ever

2794
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:20,460
because it didn't say anything about the

2795
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:22,780
game now we finally know some things

2796
01:48:22,780 --> 01:48:24,900
about the game a video has it hit the

2797
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:26,660
internet from the amusement expo that

2798
01:48:26,660 --> 01:48:29,260
finally shows a little bit about what we

2799
01:48:29,260 --> 01:48:30,880
can see in this game and we see some

2800
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:32,460
folks playing the game in this video and

2801
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:34,900
basically it looks like a little bit of

2802
01:48:34,900 --> 01:48:37,020
a mixture between pac-man championship

2803
01:48:37,020 --> 01:48:38,220
edition it kind of has those little

2804
01:48:38,220 --> 01:48:40,460
graphics and a little bit of pac-man

2805
01:48:40,460 --> 01:48:43,380
versus elements but here's the deal in

2806
01:48:43,380 --> 01:48:45,260
pac-man versus the other players are

2807
01:48:45,260 --> 01:48:46,820
playing as ghosts but that's not what's

2808
01:48:46,820 --> 01:48:48,900
happening here everybody is playing as

2809
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:52,100
different pac-man but pac-man can eat

2810
01:48:52,100 --> 01:48:54,060
the other pac-man's with a specific

2811
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:56,340
powerup and here's the coolest part of

2812
01:48:56,340 --> 01:48:59,700
all it's a cocktail cabinet so it's a

2813
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:02,260
table that's the cabinet they're playing

2814
01:49:02,260 --> 01:49:03,460
it on it's one of those old cocktail

2815
01:49:03,460 --> 01:49:04,740
but you know the lamest part about it is

2816
01:49:04,740 --> 01:49:06,020
what you dots doesn't give you any

2817
01:49:06,020 --> 01:49:07,580
points there's no points in the game

2818
01:49:07,580 --> 01:49:09,100
other than eating the other players or

2819
01:49:09,100 --> 01:49:10,300
being the last one to survive I would

2820
01:49:10,300 --> 01:49:12,100
imagine eating the dots is how you power

2821
01:49:12,100 --> 01:49:14,780
up it's basically it's basically how you

2822
01:49:14,780 --> 01:49:16,700
eating the dots is basically how you

2823
01:49:16,700 --> 01:49:18,820
trigger more dots appear and more power

2824
01:49:18,820 --> 01:49:20,660
ups in here yeah did you grow like super

2825
01:49:20,660 --> 01:49:23,140
pac-man yes you do that is beautiful yeah

2826
01:49:23,140 --> 01:49:25,120
and it's a freaking cocktail cabinet

2827
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:27,980
that's the coolest part honestly so

2828
01:49:27,980 --> 01:49:29,540
that's gonna look cool in some arcade

2829
01:49:29,540 --> 01:49:30,940
before the little kid spills their drink

2830
01:49:30,940 --> 01:49:32,740
on it but there you go that is what

2831
01:49:32,740 --> 01:49:34,300
battle royale that's gonna be my coffee

2832
01:49:34,300 --> 01:49:36,340
table you should get one of those

2833
01:49:36,340 --> 01:49:38,660
machines that's hot those machines that

2834
01:49:38,660 --> 01:49:40,380
would not be cheap dark soccer what do

2835
01:49:40,380 --> 01:49:42,220
you have for us I actually have to tell

2836
01:49:42,220 --> 01:49:43,700
everybody that Rob was grammatically

2837
01:49:43,700 --> 01:49:45,980
correct because pac-man is a proper name

2838
01:49:45,980 --> 01:49:49,500
therefore pac-man's would be correct

2839
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:52,820
instead of pac-man now if pac-man is his

2840
01:49:52,820 --> 01:49:56,180
species then pac-man would be proper just

2841
01:49:56,180 --> 01:50:02,940
checking nope don't care I'm fine see

2842
01:50:02,940 --> 01:50:10,780

isn't something that's happening in

2931
01:54:18,820 --> 01:54:20,260
America but it's something that's

2932
01:54:20,260 --> 01:54:22,540
working with McDonald's Japan they

2933
01:54:22,540 --> 01:54:24,420
actually use the DS as a training tool

2934
01:54:24,420 --> 01:54:26,420
using a training program called e smart

2935
01:54:26,420 --> 01:54:28,700
so a part-time employee will train

2936
01:54:28,700 --> 01:54:31,180
through the software it's gonna be used

2937
01:54:31,180 --> 01:54:34,340
in 3700 stores all around Japan and the

2938
01:54:34,340 --> 01:54:36,780
program's cost is about 200 million yen

2939
01:54:36,780 --> 01:54:38,500
not that somebody actually has to pay

2940
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:39,900
that that's how much it cost to develop

2941
01:54:39,900 --> 01:54:41,620
and everything McDonald's thinks it can

2942
01:54:41,620 --> 01:54:43,900
cut the training time in half by over

2943
01:54:43,900 --> 01:54:47,020
half by using this new system because

2944
01:54:47,020 --> 01:54:48,860
lots of people already know how to use

2945
01:54:48,860 --> 01:54:50,580
the DS and they want to get employees

2946
01:54:50,580 --> 01:54:53,100
quickly out on the floor kind of

2947
01:54:53,100 --> 01:54:56,100
interesting I got to admit my day job if

2948
01:54:56,100 --> 01:54:57,380
you didn't know happens it has to do a

2949
01:54:57,380 --> 01:54:59,100
training I trained for a big corporation

2950
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:01,700
and not McDonald's but you know a

2951
01:55:01,700 --> 01:55:04,340
different corporation and I'm always

2952
01:55:04,340 --> 01:55:05,380
interested in these types of new

2953
01:55:05,380 --> 01:55:09,020
training tools I guess you know if you

2954
01:55:09,020 --> 01:55:10,940
can make sure that employees are

2955
01:55:10,940 --> 01:55:12,420
comprehending the information given and

2956
01:55:12,420 --> 01:55:14,940
it's a fun interactive way to learn why

2957
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:17,220
not at least a much easier way to get

2958
01:55:17,220 --> 01:55:19,020
some of the quote-unquote boring stuff

2959
01:55:19,020 --> 01:55:20,500
out of the way for lack of a better term

2960
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:26,180
um let's see going on to blue swim

2961
01:55:26,180 --> 01:55:28,580
Twitter question did you guys take

2962
01:55:28,580 --> 01:55:31,660
advantage of Kmart's $10 off $20 plus

2963
01:55:31,660 --> 01:55:33,940
coupon overnight apparently there was an

2964
01:55:33,940 --> 01:55:36,140
online coupon for its NYC stores that

2965
01:55:36,140 --> 01:55:38,220
wasn't region locked allowing people

2966
01:55:38,220 --> 01:55:40,900
everywhere to use it no I hadn't heard

2967
01:55:40,900 --> 01:55:42,660
and I would be real it would be really

2968
01:55:42,660 --> 01:55:44,300
hard to get me to set foot in a Kmart

2969
01:55:44,300 --> 01:55:46,340
anyway I guess it came out around the

2970
01:55:46,340 --> 01:55:48,220
corner but you know free money is a

2971
01:55:48,220 --> 01:55:49,980
pretty good way to do it I gotta say so

2972
01:55:49,980 --> 01:55:54,100
oops we started to have mailbag music

2973
01:55:54,100 --> 01:55:55,100
play in the background there we don't

2974
01:55:55,100 --> 01:55:58,340
want that s to 100 Matt is linking us to

2975
01:55:58,340 --> 01:56:01,020
a story about an apple related incident

2976
01:56:01,020 --> 01:56:03,260
where Apple apparently banned a game

2977
01:56:03,260 --> 01:56:05,300
developer because he called the store

2978
01:56:05,300 --> 01:56:08,180
awful and horrible is the developers

2979
01:56:08,180 --> 01:56:11,780
name was Tommy reference and the Apple

2980
01:56:11,780 --> 01:56:15,340
removed his app zits and giggles well

2981
01:56:15,340 --> 01:56:16,940
for starters that just needed to be

2982
01:56:16,940 --> 01:56:20,460
removed but whatever apparently the

2983
01:56:20,460 --> 01:56:22,340
creator was that game developers

2984
01:56:22,340 --> 01:56:25,860
conference and he said that he absolutely

2985
01:56:25,860 --> 01:56:28,420
fucking hates the iPhone app store he

2986
01:56:28,420 --> 01:56:30,380
said that the iPhone gaming market is

2987
01:56:30,380 --> 01:56:32,540
like the Tigard handheld games of sorry

2988
01:56:32,540 --> 01:56:34,500
the tiger handheld games of the 80s and

2989
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:36,460
90s you might remember those crappy

2990
01:56:36,460 --> 01:56:38,300
little LCD games like mr. game and watch

2991
01:56:38,300 --> 01:56:42,020
esque stuff also zits and giggles this

2992
01:56:42,020 --> 01:56:43,740
is the guy this is the company and I

2993
01:56:43,740 --> 01:56:44,860
think we've talked about on the store

2994
01:56:44,860 --> 01:56:47,100
they would keep raising the price of

2995
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:48,580
their game to see who would keep buying

2996
01:56:48,580 --> 01:56:50,700
it and they had raised it up to over

2997
01:56:50,700 --> 01:56:52,980
four hundred dollars apple of course

2998
01:56:52,980 --> 01:56:56,060
didn't tell any reason why they took the

2999
01:56:56,060 --> 01:56:59,460
game down so there you go but maybe had

3000
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:00,740
to be with the fact that he was acting

3001
01:57:00,740 --> 01:57:03,540
like a dick and if you bite the hand

3002
01:57:03,540 --> 01:57:05,380
that feeds you they're probably going to

3003
01:57:05,380 --> 01:57:10,380
cut you off I own o tropic asks puzzle

3004
01:57:10,380 --> 01:57:13,220
quest to discuss the puzzle crack puzzle

3005
01:57:13,220 --> 01:57:15,580
quest 2 is not out yet is it it's not

3006
01:57:15,580 --> 01:57:17,780
out yet it's coming out Alan I know

3007
01:57:17,780 --> 01:57:19,300
you're a big puzzle quest fan and you

3008
01:57:19,300 --> 01:57:20,900
like the gyromancers and those types of

3009
01:57:20,900 --> 01:57:22,580
games what do you want in a puzzle quest

3010
01:57:22,580 --> 01:57:24,020
to is there anything you're looking for

3011
01:57:24,020 --> 01:57:29,060
um just have it not be Galactrix really

3012
01:57:29,060 --> 01:57:31,300
it's not Galactrix this time no they're

3013
01:57:31,300 --> 01:57:32,900
going back to the old school puzzle

3014
01:57:32,900 --> 01:57:35,620
quest it's more yield a bejeweling yeah

3015
01:57:35,620 --> 01:57:37,700
so there you just want more of the same

3016
01:57:37,700 --> 01:57:40,620
you know no features you get to go well

3017
01:57:40,620 --> 01:57:43,300
they have like pickle quests or something

3018
01:57:43,300 --> 01:57:45,700
like that you know pickle quest I think

3019
01:57:45,700 --> 01:57:48,140
our soccer be all over that pick pickle

3020
01:57:48,140 --> 01:57:52,220
nights with a K pickle death all right

3021
01:57:52,220 --> 01:57:54,500
and lastly act death links us to the

3022
01:57:54,500 --> 01:57:56,620
story Australia is closer to getting m

3023
01:57:56,620 --> 01:57:59,100
rated games it says the tweet that came

3024
01:57:59,100 --> 01:58:02,220
to us at olr Lincoln is this story about

3025
01:58:02,220 --> 01:58:04,540
somebody I guess who is stepping down

3026
01:58:04,540 --> 01:58:07,700
Michael Atkinson is the South Australian

3027
01:58:07,700 --> 01:58:10,020
Attorney General and apparently he's the

3028
01:58:10,020 --> 01:58:12,980
reason why there is no r18 plus rating

3029
01:58:12,980 --> 01:58:14,940
for games he's stepping down and the

3030
01:58:14,940 --> 01:58:17,260
thought is maybe somebody will get in

3031
01:58:17,260 --> 01:58:18,340
there that knows what they're talking

3032
01:58:18,340 --> 01:58:20,260
about with this rating system so maybe

3033
01:58:20,260 --> 01:58:21,540
we won't have so many stories about

3034
01:58:21,540 --> 01:58:24,340
Australia gets such-and-such banned game

3035
01:58:24,340 --> 01:58:26,220
or what have you in the future that

3036
01:58:26,220 --> 01:58:28,260
would be exciting for them we'll hope at

3037
01:58:28,260 --> 01:58:31,060
least anyway for them all right let's

3038
01:58:31,060 --> 01:58:32,940
get back into some news the Loki which

3039
01:58:32,940 --> 01:58:35,940
got forced tonight apparently Pikmin 3

3040
01:58:35,940 --> 01:58:38,500
is in development and Miyamoto has

3041
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:40,820
confirmed that I believe he confirmed it

3042
01:58:40,820 --> 01:58:43,180
before though if you ask me but whatever

3043
01:58:43,180 --> 01:58:45,180
apparently the official Nintendo

3044
01:58:45,180 --> 01:58:48,820
magazine in the UK was saying that you

3045
01:58:48,820 --> 01:58:51,940
know Miyamoto has confirmed that Pikmin

3046
01:58:51,940 --> 01:58:54,620
3 development is well underway over a

3047
01:58:54,620 --> 01:58:57,700
year ago it was rumored to be released

3048
01:58:57,700 --> 01:59:00,820
apparently around this time but it's not

3049
01:59:00,820 --> 01:59:07,180
obviously and no word exactly what

3050
01:59:07,180 --> 01:59:08,740
they're going to change about it

3051
01:59:08,740 --> 01:59:12,500
apparently the thought is maybe they're

3052
01:59:12,500 --> 01:59:16,660
going to announce something e3 I don't

3053
01:59:16,660 --> 01:59:18,220
know I've never really got into the

3054
01:59:18,220 --> 01:59:19,900
Pikmin games it's sort of like perfect

3055
01:59:19,900 --> 01:59:21,540
dark for me I'd never really played it

3056
01:59:21,540 --> 01:59:23,660
before I don't know if you think this is

3057
01:59:23,660 --> 01:59:25,100
a game I would enjoy or what is the

3058
01:59:25,100 --> 01:59:27,420
appeal of Pikmin to the masses I have no

3059
01:59:27,420 --> 01:59:30,180
idea to be honest I never played them

3060
01:59:30,180 --> 01:59:32,180
and I know when they were released the

3061
01:59:32,180 --> 01:59:36,100
GameCube one they only did the first

3062
01:59:36,100 --> 01:59:37,820
GameCube one over here too because they

3063
01:59:37,820 --> 01:59:40,220
had the second one come out in Japan but

3064
01:59:40,220 --> 01:59:42,740
that new play control series I don't

3065
01:59:42,740 --> 01:59:45,660
think it did very well over here and a

3066
01:59:45,660 --> 01:59:47,180
lot of the games didn't get released I

3067
01:59:47,180 --> 01:59:48,660
got released isn't that Nintendo's

3068
01:59:48,660 --> 01:59:50,660
lesson learned like stop supporting the

3069
01:59:50,660 --> 01:59:53,340
same shit we already had exactly and I'm

3070
01:59:53,340 --> 01:59:55,660
just gonna tell you right now Pikmin 3

3071
01:59:55,660 --> 01:59:56,580
is probably not going to be any

3072
01:59:56,580 --> 01:59:59,580
different than Pikmin 2 it'll just be on

3073
01:59:59,580 --> 02:00:01,420
the Wii and you'll buy it anyways

3074
02:00:01,420 --> 02:00:03,500
because you're sucker but I don't think

3075
02:00:03,500 --> 02:00:05,300
this is gonna have the same draw as like

3076
02:00:05,300 --> 02:00:08,140
say a Mario Galaxy or something like

3077
02:00:08,140 --> 02:00:11,260
that and you know and not that this

3078
02:00:11,260 --> 02:00:13,100
would be a horrible thing I think it

3079
02:00:13,100 --> 02:00:15,100
would be a very cheap thing to do but I

3080
02:00:15,100 --> 02:00:17,580
could see Nintendo doing another new

3081
02:00:17,580 --> 02:00:20,380
Super Mario Brothers game this soon you

3082
02:00:20,380 --> 02:00:21,740
know what I mean very it's very possible

3083
02:00:21,740 --> 02:00:24,740
I went to the chat room and I asked in

3084
02:00:24,740 --> 02:00:26,900
chat at chat.ownersloudestrader.com I

3085
02:00:26,900 --> 02:00:28,620
said chat help me out what is the appeal

3086
02:00:28,620 --> 02:00:30,580
of Pikmin and G Ditz replied is there

3087
02:00:30,580 --> 02:00:33,220
any? Hackdeft replied Pikmin is basically

3088
02:00:33,220 --> 02:00:36,580
an RTS but cute so that is apparently

3089
02:00:36,580 --> 02:00:40,140
what it is it's an RTS but cute so there

3090
02:00:40,140 --> 02:00:43,420
you go and ToaGak seems to think if

3091
02:00:43,420 --> 02:00:45,860
Pikmin 3 does not equal 2 then 3 does

3092
02:00:45,860 --> 02:00:48,620
not equal 1 Frisbee says Pikmin was

3093
02:00:48,620 --> 02:00:50,980
great nine years ago Lama Juice says I

3094
02:00:50,980 --> 02:00:52,420
like Pikmin 1 I thought the game was

3095
02:00:52,420 --> 02:00:55,380
really fun so I don't know it's just one of those

3096
02:00:55,380 --> 02:00:57,580
games I never got around to playing so ToaGak

3097
02:00:57,580 --> 02:00:59,660
also chimes in and says I fucking hate

3098
02:00:59,660 --> 02:01:02,060
the new play controls. Spike McCrew says

3099
02:01:02,060 --> 02:01:04,620
it's got calm music. So we need a new

3100
02:01:04,620 --> 02:01:07,980
Star Fox or a new F-Zero that's what we

3101
02:01:07,980 --> 02:01:13,260
need for Pikmin so all right well I've

3102
02:01:13,260 --> 02:01:14,740
got another story for you guys and it

3103
02:01:14,740 --> 02:01:17,820
has to do with the first lady Michelle

3104
02:01:17,820 --> 02:01:20,500
Obama yes video games and the White

3105
02:01:20,500 --> 02:01:23,020
House believe it or not and apparently

3106
02:01:23,020 --> 02:01:27,100
it's because the government has kind of

3107
02:01:27,100 --> 02:01:29,900
in a way endorsed Dance Dance Revolution

3108
02:01:29,900 --> 02:01:32,180
okay let me explain how this works here

3109
02:01:32,180 --> 02:01:34,860
let's move is a new program and first

3110
02:01:34,860 --> 02:01:36,460
lady Michelle Obama was there for the

3111
02:01:36,460 --> 02:01:38,460
kickoff and she actually mentioned the

3112
02:01:38,460 --> 02:01:40,820
game by name in her speech she said and

3113
02:01:40,820 --> 02:01:42,660
I have to say that many of you have been

3114
02:01:42,660 --> 02:01:44,620
very creative on this piece already

3115
02:01:44,620 --> 02:01:47,280
folks in West Virginia have taken the

3116
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:49,820
lead in bringing DDR that's Dance Dance

3117
02:01:49,820 --> 02:01:51,660
Revolution it's a new video game that

3118
02:01:51,660 --> 02:01:54,260
gets kids up and moving haha new the

3119
02:01:54,260 --> 02:01:56,540
game's been around since what 98 many

3120
02:01:56,540 --> 02:01:58,220
other states use it as well and let me

3121
02:01:58,220 --> 02:02:00,020
tell you I can attest to Dance Dance

3122
02:02:00,020 --> 02:02:02,220
Revolution we got it at Camp David and

3123
02:02:02,220 --> 02:02:04,020
it'll make you sweat and it's addictive

3124
02:02:04,020 --> 02:02:05,700
in a very good way the president still

3125
02:02:05,700 --> 02:02:08,960
can't do it so anyhow that's cute I want

3126
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:11,460
to point out that let's move is not just

3127
02:02:11,460 --> 02:02:13,540
about DDR though but it's more about

3128
02:02:13,540 --> 02:02:16,460
getting you know kids and stuff up and

3129
02:02:16,460 --> 02:02:18,980
moving so it's a good thing they didn't

3130
02:02:18,980 --> 02:02:22,740
call the program let them move though a

3131
02:02:22,740 --> 02:02:26,620
big groan from the DDR crowd I would

3132
02:02:26,620 --> 02:02:28,380
find them I love the fact though that

3133
02:02:28,380 --> 02:02:31,940
it's a quote-unquote new video game well

3134
02:02:31,940 --> 02:02:33,900
technically that's true they're making

3135
02:02:33,900 --> 02:02:36,300
new video games in that series all the

3136
02:02:36,300 --> 02:02:40,340
time it's just it's nowhere near new so

3137
02:02:40,340 --> 02:02:43,100
all right dark soccer's got a story for

3138
02:02:43,100 --> 02:02:46,220
us and then listless is coming up well

3139
02:02:46,220 --> 02:02:51,860
um steam is of course removing

3140
02:02:51,860 --> 02:02:54,860
Assassin's Creed 2 and silent hunter 5

3141
02:02:54,860 --> 02:02:57,100
but it says it wasn't because of the DRM

3142
02:02:57,100 --> 02:03:02,500
they are actually available in places

3143
02:03:02,500 --> 02:03:05,420
other than steam it's just specifically

3144
02:03:05,420 --> 02:03:10,740
that steam UK didn't wasn't wanting to

3145
02:03:10,740 --> 02:03:13,020
deal with it they said that it has to do

3146
02:03:13,020 --> 02:03:15,140
with local business discussion between

3147
02:03:15,140 --> 02:03:18,180
Ubisoft and steam in the UK but yeah but

3148
02:03:18,180 --> 02:03:25,140
it's no longer available well I guess I

3149
02:03:25,140 --> 02:03:27,780
want to try to fix it well you know I

3150
02:03:27,780 --> 02:03:29,820
know steam is denying it and it's

3151
02:03:29,820 --> 02:03:32,300
probably accurate because it sounds like

3152
02:03:32,300 --> 02:03:34,940
this is isolated to overseas it's not

3153
02:03:34,940 --> 02:03:36,980
really happening here UK specific yeah

3154
02:03:36,980 --> 02:03:40,340
so but but I still go back to the point

3155
02:03:40,340 --> 02:03:41,580
I was saying before when I was talking

3156
02:03:41,580 --> 02:03:43,700
about how Ubisoft DRM is not just going

3157
02:03:43,700 --> 02:03:46,060
to get Ubisoft in trouble that they're

3158
02:03:46,060 --> 02:03:48,700
going to be calling places like Target

3159
02:03:48,700 --> 02:03:50,420
and Walmart where people buy these games

3160
02:03:50,420 --> 02:03:52,260
say my game doesn't work and returning

3161
02:03:52,260 --> 02:03:53,740
it and the retailer is going to get

3162
02:03:53,740 --> 02:03:55,180
caught in the middle and the minute that

3163
02:03:55,180 --> 02:03:56,300
starts happening they're going to stop

3164
02:03:56,300 --> 02:03:58,300
carrying these games so I think it's

3165
02:03:58,300 --> 02:04:00,180
ridiculous anything I'll ask any of this

3166
02:04:00,180 --> 02:04:04,380
through all right well folks it is that

3167
02:04:04,380 --> 02:04:06,260
time and we haven't done this in a

3168
02:04:06,260 --> 02:04:07,740
little while on the show but I'm very

3169
02:04:07,740 --> 02:04:09,100
excited that tonight we are bringing

3170
02:04:09,100 --> 02:04:16,580
back for a 360 episode listless okay

3171
02:04:16,580 --> 02:04:18,860
now there's a lot of people in our chat

3172
02:04:18,860 --> 02:04:20,660
room that are kind of newer to the show

3173
02:04:20,660 --> 02:04:21,820
and they don't know how this works so

3174
02:04:21,820 --> 02:04:23,820
let me explain it for you guys what we're

3175
02:04:23,820 --> 02:04:24,860
going to do is we're going to go around

3176
02:04:24,860 --> 02:04:26,700
the room and we are going to create the

3177
02:04:26,700 --> 02:04:29,220
definitive list about a certain topic

3178
02:04:29,220 --> 02:04:31,780
and tonight's topic is the great idea

3179
02:04:31,780 --> 02:04:33,860
that Microsoft should steal and make

3180
02:04:33,860 --> 02:04:36,100
better next sometimes our answers are

3181
02:04:36,100 --> 02:04:37,780
serious sometimes they're silly

3182
02:04:37,780 --> 02:04:40,060
sometimes they're completely nonsensical

3183
02:04:40,060 --> 02:04:42,340
but like it or not it is the list that

3184
02:04:42,340 --> 02:04:44,660
we have come up with for the question

3185
02:04:44,660 --> 02:04:47,060
now once all four of us since we have

3186
02:04:47,060 --> 02:04:49,300
our special guest Alan tonight come up

3187
02:04:49,300 --> 02:04:51,100
with our list we'll have a list of 12

3188
02:04:51,100 --> 02:04:54,140
then the hard part comes we will each go

3189
02:04:54,140 --> 02:04:56,980
around the room and remove one item from

3190
02:04:56,980 --> 02:04:58,660
the list usually it's someone else's

3191
02:04:58,660 --> 02:04:59,900
item but you can remove your own I

3192
02:04:59,900 --> 02:05:01,260
suppose if you are feeling cannibalistic

3193
02:05:01,260 --> 02:05:03,340
like that that will leave us with a list

3194
02:05:03,340 --> 02:05:05,940
of eight then our chat room will vote

3195
02:05:05,940 --> 02:05:08,180
for their number one and number two

3196
02:05:08,180 --> 02:05:10,460
favorite in a private message to me and

3197
02:05:10,460 --> 02:05:14,860
then your top three answers based on

3198
02:05:14,860 --> 02:05:16,420
your votes will come up with our

3199
02:05:16,420 --> 02:05:20,220
definitive list now keep in mind you can

3200
02:05:20,220 --> 02:05:21,620
send us private message now if you have

3201
02:05:21,620 --> 02:05:23,340
an answer if you want to help the hosts

3202
02:05:23,340 --> 02:05:26,180
out and because you know sometimes we

3203
02:05:26,180 --> 02:05:27,940
are thinking of topics right on the

3204
02:05:27,940 --> 02:05:29,820
right in the heat of the moment I'm

3205
02:05:29,820 --> 02:05:32,980
Loki you can yell out your answers in

3206
02:05:32,980 --> 02:05:34,540
chat right now and they might get

3207
02:05:34,540 --> 02:05:37,100
included in the host list so again that

3208
02:05:37,100 --> 02:05:40,580
is the great idea that Microsoft

3209
02:05:40,580 --> 02:05:43,660
Microsoft Microsoft Microsoft Microsoft

3210
02:05:43,660 --> 02:05:47,140
Microsoft I never met a carrot I didn't

3211
02:05:47,140 --> 02:05:49,740
like except for this one the great idea

3212
02:05:49,740 --> 02:05:52,860
that Microsoft should steal next all

3213
02:05:52,860 --> 02:05:54,540
right who wants to start us off tonight

3214
02:05:54,540 --> 02:05:57,060
Loki I'll call on you and see if you did

3215
02:05:57,060 --> 02:05:59,860
your homework your number three answer

3216
02:05:59,860 --> 02:06:02,060
for the great idea because again I want

3217
02:06:02,060 --> 02:06:02,980
to remind you guys where this topic

3218
02:06:02,980 --> 02:06:06,460
comes from project Natal stolen motion

3219
02:06:06,460 --> 02:06:10,820
controller basically Xbox live kind of

3220
02:06:10,820 --> 02:06:12,500
taking some things from PC gaming and

3221
02:06:12,500 --> 02:06:15,180
incorporating into their games you know

3222
02:06:15,180 --> 02:06:17,620
the Xbox takes other people's ideas not

3223
02:06:17,620 --> 02:06:18,540
that there's anything wrong with that

3224
02:06:18,540 --> 02:06:20,180
because they make them better they take

3225
02:06:20,180 --> 02:06:21,100
other people's ideas and make them

3226
02:06:21,100 --> 02:06:24,380
better all right so here we go what

3227
02:06:24,380 --> 02:06:27,180
should they improve next and I guess it

3228
02:06:27,180 --> 02:06:28,820
doesn't have to be gaming related but it

3229
02:06:28,820 --> 02:06:30,700
helps all right Loki what is your oops I

3230
02:06:30,700 --> 02:06:32,620
gotta get my own little whiteboard up

3231
02:06:32,620 --> 02:06:34,500
here to keep track of our answers Loki

3232
02:06:34,500 --> 02:06:36,500
what is your number three answer for the

3233
02:06:36,500 --> 02:06:39,060
idea that they should steal next the PSP

3234
02:06:39,060 --> 02:06:42,420
the PSP so making like a handheld system

3235
02:06:42,420 --> 02:06:44,900
essentially you're just the PSP no a

3236
02:06:44,900 --> 02:06:47,300
handheld system they shouldn't exactly

3237
02:06:47,300 --> 02:06:49,180
make it like the PSP but like you know

3238
02:06:49,180 --> 02:06:51,060
something that's a widescreen you know

3239
02:06:51,060 --> 02:06:54,420
possibly high def you know handheld

3240
02:06:54,420 --> 02:06:56,540
system plays decent games me ties in

3241
02:06:56,540 --> 02:07:00,300
with Xbox live arcade and you know Xbox

3242
02:07:00,300 --> 02:07:03,700
live and that kind of stuff cool so Loki

3243
02:07:03,700 --> 02:07:05,500
is kind of going serious for once this

3244
02:07:05,500 --> 02:07:07,580
is a little other worry me I won't be

3245
02:07:07,580 --> 02:07:09,500
like that all right fine fine

02:07:24,940 --> 02:07:27,020
is that they you know the there was

3253
02:07:27,020 --> 02:07:29,300
rumors that they had that um little

3254
02:07:29,300 --> 02:07:30,620
monster-making game I guess that was

3255
02:07:30,620 --> 02:07:31,860
more a little big planet though than

3256
02:07:31,860 --> 02:07:34,580

Foreman grilling to the next level by

02:10:06,740 --> 02:10:09,380
with the pokemons for the Pokemon game

3307
02:10:09,380 --> 02:10:11,460

3308
02:10:11,460 --> 02:10:14,220
my number two answer let's see where is

3309
02:10:14,220 --> 02:10:16,460
my list my number two answer idea that

3310
02:10:16,460 --> 02:10:18,900
Xbox should steal and make better a game

3311
02:10:18,900 --> 02:10:20,780
starring a fat plumber and his brother

3312
02:10:20,780 --> 02:10:22,880
and a game starring a fruity elf with

3313
02:10:22,880 --> 02:10:26,140
big ears is my number to answer so

3314
02:10:26,140 --> 02:10:28,140
that's a mouthful there but you know I

3315
02:10:28,140 --> 02:10:29,540
just it worked for some of their

3316
02:10:29,540 --> 02:10:31,760
competitors so my number two answer a

3317
02:10:31,760 --> 02:10:33,440
game starring a fat plumber and his

3318
02:10:33,440 --> 02:10:35,920
brother and a game starring a fruity elf

3319
02:10:35,920 --> 02:10:39,420
with big ears there you go now we're

3320
02:10:39,420 --> 02:10:40,940
gonna go around and get everybody's

3321
02:10:40,940 --> 02:10:43,140
number one answer let me read the list

3322
02:10:43,140 --> 02:10:50,020
list for you guys so far. A handheld system, Pokemans, the Colonel's recipe, the hot lesbian

3323
02:10:50,020 --> 02:10:55,820
tester, George Foreman full cow grilling machine, an expansion module for other system games,

3324
02:10:55,820 --> 02:10:59,620
visual memory cards, a game starring a fat plumber and his brother, and a game starring

3325
02:10:59,620 --> 02:11:06,880
a fruity elf with big ears. Alright, now we get down to the number one answers. The number

3326
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:13,140
one thing you most want to see the Xbox 360 steal and make better. Loki. Well if they're

3327
02:11:13,140 --> 02:11:19,020
going to be guaranteed to make something better, I can't think of a better response than sex.

3328
02:11:19,020 --> 02:11:26,400
They have, there's not really much better than sex but I guess if they're going to find

3329
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:33,380
a way to make it better, more power to them. So yes, Microsoft impressed me by making something

3330
02:11:33,380 --> 02:11:47,880
better than sex. There you go. Make sex better. You know what, Microsoft actually can't because

3331
02:11:47,880 --> 02:11:53,560
there's already toys. No, I'm saying they've got to find a way. They have an obligation

3332
02:11:53,560 --> 02:11:59,740
to steal it and make it better. So sex is what it is. Would that be like a peripheral?

3333
02:11:59,740 --> 02:12:12,020
Whatever it takes. They would have to defeat Hello Kitty in the Hitachi Magic Wand. Dare

3334
02:12:12,020 --> 02:12:16,660
I ask for your number one answer, what should they steal and make better? Rainbow farting

3335
02:12:16,660 --> 02:12:23,100
unicorns. Rainbow farting unicorns. Is that, are you talking about, what is that, robot

3336
02:12:23,100 --> 02:12:26,900
magic unicorn or whatever it is? Whatever it is. What's the name of the game? Well my

3337
02:12:26,900 --> 02:12:32,820
original answer, my original answer was Propel. Propel, but you want robot unicorn attack.

3338
02:12:32,820 --> 02:12:42,820
Farty robot unicorns. It's, it's rainbow farting unicorns. Yeah. Rainbow farting. Rainbow farting

3339
02:12:42,820 --> 02:12:47,580
or farting? Farting. Robot unicorns. That's a special attack cause they fart. There you

3340
02:12:47,580 --> 02:12:52,780
go. Alright. To an all eraser soundtrack. To an all eraser soundtrack, you got it. Or

3341
02:12:52,780 --> 02:13:01,620
Netshot Boys works too. Dark Sakura, you need to let it go. Okay, your number one answer,

3342
02:13:01,620 --> 02:13:05,660
Ellen, what is your number one answer for a thing you want Microsoft to steal and make

3343
02:13:05,660 --> 02:13:13,620
better? He's thinking. I'm blanking. You're blanking? After the sex thing. After the sex

3344
02:13:13,620 --> 02:13:23,780
thing you just can't? Help ya? Sure. The Bible. Okay, yeah. Jesus. If they could do Jesus.

3345
02:13:23,780 --> 02:13:30,620
Super Jesus. You don't want to do the YouTube you sent me earlier? Alright, fine. Alright.

3346
02:13:30,620 --> 02:13:38,780
Jesus is the idea that they're going to steal and make better. Okay. Oh lord. Alright, and

3347
02:13:38,780 --> 02:13:44,580
my number one answer. I, I don't know. I just kind of decided to go for the obvious. Blu-ray.

3348
02:13:44,580 --> 02:13:51,820
They already did. It was HD DVD. But it wasn't really better. I mean, and they were can't

3349
02:13:51,820 --> 02:13:55,660
kind of came out at the same time, but now that Blu-ray is out, they can take Blu-ray

3350
02:13:55,660 --> 02:14:03,560
and make it better. Alright. Robot Jesus attack. That'd be kind of cool. Here's the list as

3351
02:14:03,560 --> 02:14:09,080
it stands before the elimination. A handheld system. Pokemans. The Colonel's recipe. The

3352
02:14:09,080 --> 02:14:13,940
hot lesbian tester. George Foreman's full cow grilling machine. An expansion module

3353
02:14:13,940 --> 02:14:18,760
for other system games. Visual memory cards. A game starring a fat plumber and his brother

3354
02:14:18,760 --> 02:14:25,100
in a game starring a fruity elf with big ears. Sex. Rainbow farting robot unicorns. Jesus

3355
02:14:25,100 --> 02:14:31,580
and Blu-ray. Things that Microsoft is going to steal and make better. Loki. What is not

3356
02:14:31,580 --> 02:14:36,100
worthy of being on the list? Unfortunately, we got to narrow this down to eight is a tough

3357
02:14:36,100 --> 02:14:41,140
process. Feelings will be hurt. Hair will be pulled, but it must happen. Loki. Which

3358
02:14:41,140 --> 02:14:45,260
of these is not worthy of the list? Blu-ray because it's going to get phased out anyways.

3359
02:14:45,260 --> 02:14:50,900
You're a bastard. All right. Blu-rays off the list. Dark Sakura. Which of these is not

3360
02:14:50,900 --> 02:15:00,060
worthy of the list? Sex. You eliminated sex. It's overrated. They're going to make it better.

3361
02:15:00,060 --> 02:15:09,900
Come on. Better sex. I mean, this is dark soccer has eliminated from the list. Why?

3362
02:15:09,900 --> 02:15:14,140
I don't want it on the list. No, I understand, but it's just funny. Our chat room is going

3363
02:15:14,140 --> 02:15:19,060
to yell on screen. There's going to be hair pulling. It's boring. It is boring. They're

3364
02:15:19,060 --> 02:15:23,980
going to make it better. No, it'll, it'll launch. And then all of a sudden red rings.

3365
02:15:23,980 --> 02:15:30,020
Oh no. And it won't matter for the guys involved. They never have a problem. I don't want to

3366
02:15:30,020 --> 02:15:36,260
wear red rings on my balls. All right. It'll be, it'll be over before the women enjoy it.

3367
02:15:36,260 --> 02:15:43,500
All right. Alan, which of these is not worthy? Oh, dark soccer is getting booed by chat.

3368
02:15:43,500 --> 02:15:51,500
Go in there and regulate dark soccer. All right. Alan, which of these is not worthy

3369
02:15:51,500 --> 02:15:58,860
of the list? The hot lesbian tester. Oh, you bastard. Why do you not love lesbians? No

3370
02:15:58,860 --> 02:16:04,580
way to messing around person. Why are you taking the hot lesbian tester off the list?

3371
02:16:04,580 --> 02:16:13,660
I don't know. Just cause it's my answer. Dick. All right. You're going to, you're going to

3372
02:16:13,660 --> 02:16:19,960
wish that the three 60 had the sex support pretty soon. All right. Um, the item I'm going

3373
02:16:19,960 --> 02:16:25,700
to eliminate from the list. Um, I am taking off, I'm taking off the George Foreman full

3374
02:16:25,700 --> 02:16:31,140
cow grilling machine because that joke is so 2007. It's the PS three that looks like

3375
02:16:31,140 --> 02:16:35,860
one. Yeah. I don't want them to copy that. That's the PS three things. Let Sony have

3376
02:16:35,860 --> 02:16:40,700
something. All right. So that's why I've eliminated from the list. So here we go. Lim can only

3377
02:16:40,700 --> 02:16:46,940
do veal. These are the eight that you can vote for tonight. A handheld system pokey

3378
02:16:46,940 --> 02:16:53,400
man's the Colonel's recipe, an expansion module for other system games, visual memory cards,

3379
02:16:53,400 --> 02:16:57,700
a game starring a fat plumber and his brother in a game starring a fruity elf with big ears,

3380
02:16:57,700 --> 02:17:03,840
rainbow farting robot unicorns and Jesus, which of these should they steal and make

3381
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:12,640
better? Send a private message to sky in the chat room with your two votes. And if you

3382
02:17:12,640 --> 02:17:18,200
want the blur beta code, I have two to give away tonight. Send in your votes and the message

3383
02:17:18,200 --> 02:17:23,160
that says, I want the blur beta code or something along those lines. If you don't want the blur

3384
02:17:23,160 --> 02:17:27,760
beta code, don't send me that message, but you can still send me your votes. Okay. So

3385
02:17:27,760 --> 02:17:34,080
you send me an additional message that says, um, I want the blur beta code. All right.

3386
02:17:34,080 --> 02:17:38,280
If you don't know how to send a private message, I will recap that process for you in chat

3387
02:17:38,280 --> 02:17:45,480
real soon for now, back to the show. While those votes come in, some folks in chat said,

3388
02:17:45,480 --> 02:17:48,800
we made the list boring. We took off every single interesting answer. We took off the

3389
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:54,200
lesbians, the sex, the meat. Everything was gone. All right. Uh, by the way, the beta

3390
02:17:54,200 --> 02:17:59,300
code is only on the three 60. You must have a three 60. Please do not ask for the code.

3391
02:17:59,300 --> 02:18:02,960
If you yourself are not going to use it. If you sell that shit on eBay, I will find you

3392
02:18:02,960 --> 02:18:10,160
and I will end your life. All right. Moving on. She didn't really sell those codes. I

3393
02:18:10,160 --> 02:18:14,020
mean, considering that they're floating around. Exactly. All right. Loki, what do you have

3394
02:18:14,020 --> 02:18:21,180
for us while I start to tally up the votes? Um, so Bethesda and in exile have announced

3395
02:18:21,180 --> 02:18:25,060
that they're going to be putting out a new game called hunted the demons forge. It's

3396
02:18:25,060 --> 02:18:32,200
a co-op, looks like a hack and slash game. Kind of looks neat. And um, they say it's

3397
02:18:32,200 --> 02:18:38,920
going to take us back to our roots. And apparently it's like a warriors and archers and putting

3398
02:18:38,920 --> 02:18:45,080
holes through things with sharp objects. And apparently it will be in, it's in development

3399
02:18:45,080 --> 02:18:53,640
for Xbox three 60 and PS three and games for windows. And this was, I don't know, gets

3400
02:18:53,640 --> 02:18:58,380
shown off at a GDC. Was this like the top secret game that Bethesda is supposedly working

3401
02:18:58,380 --> 02:19:02,460
on that everybody thought was the blizzard MMO? I don't know, but it looks like it's

3402
02:19:02,460 --> 02:19:08,800
just like a hack and slash game. Looks cool though. It looks really neat, but I mean,

3403
02:19:08,800 --> 02:19:12,920
I don't know if this is the top secret game they're working on and this is Bethesda, not

3404
02:19:12,920 --> 02:19:20,260
blizzard. All right. Oh, I meant to say Bethesda. I say blizzard. Sorry. I'm getting distracted

3405
02:19:20,260 --> 02:19:24,760
with the cage, uh, tallying the votes for, um, listless right now. Um, let me get to

3406
02:19:24,760 --> 02:19:33,560
this next story real quick about layoffs at IGN. Unfortunately layoffs have, uh, hit IGN

3407
02:19:33,560 --> 02:19:38,900
and um, yep, too bad. So sad. Sorry to hear it. Uh, but unfortunately a lot of folks got

3408
02:19:38,900 --> 02:19:45,640
laid off over at IGN and um, I don't know, I guess that'll be less podcast now. All right.

3409
02:19:45,640 --> 02:19:53,320
Times are tough and it's not funny when people lose their jobs, but um, you know, it's tough

3410
02:19:53,320 --> 02:20:00,400
out there. It's hard out there for a pimp. What can I say? If they really love games,

3411
02:20:00,400 --> 02:20:04,560
there'll be people doing it for free, just like, um, you know, many other people do.

3412
02:20:04,560 --> 02:20:08,240
So we'll see. No one in particular, Rob, right? No, no one in particular. All right, let's

3413
02:20:08,240 --> 02:20:12,200
get to the mailbag. Every week you guys send us emails, mailbag at orange lounge reader.com

3414
02:20:12,200 --> 02:20:18,200
and we read some here on air. Darkstalker is going to open up the mailbag, rip it right

3415
02:20:18,200 --> 02:20:22,240
open and pull out some of her favorite emails. I'm reading them for you right now. I would

3416
02:20:22,240 --> 02:20:27,240
be happy to, but my window that had all the emails on it actually just, uh, completely

3417
02:20:27,240 --> 02:20:31,100
vanished. I have to reopen. Can you reopen it real quick? Okay. Cause I got to tally

3418
02:20:31,100 --> 02:20:37,520
the cage match votes here or yeah, sorry. Listless votes. I'm pulling it back up. Okay.

3419
02:20:37,520 --> 02:20:41,680
Hold your, keep your pants on to do. I don't want dead air. Look, Loki, what are you watching

3420
02:20:41,680 --> 02:20:45,820
over there? Here we go. I've got the first one. I'm watching a violent video of someone

3421
02:20:45,820 --> 02:20:52,560
making levels in a worry where a DIY like blowing someone in half. Uh, here's another

3422
02:20:52,560 --> 02:20:59,720
one there. I'm shooting them. Yeah. Shooting with rainbow farts, sniper rifle. This is

3423
02:20:59,720 --> 02:21:04,340
from cheeseburger. Yay. Hey, as you may or may not know, I've been saving up for gaming

3424
02:21:04,340 --> 02:21:09,800
PC for a year now. I finally got the money just this morning and I spent 1300 at new

3425
02:21:09,800 --> 02:21:13,960
egg. This PC will be good enough to run almost any game on your highest settings. The only

3426
02:21:13,960 --> 02:21:18,600
games I have right now, a world of Warcraft addict and command and conquer three and a

3427
02:21:18,600 --> 02:21:24,280
few hours and hoping to win an eBay auction of crisis. My question is, do you have any

3428
02:21:24,280 --> 02:21:28,600
recommendations for games I should get when the game was released? It was no matter just

3429
02:21:28,600 --> 02:21:37,720
that they're good games. I suggest loom. Um, Star Trek online. I don't know. Some of the

3430
02:21:37,720 --> 02:21:43,040
like Borderlands is pretty cool if you don't have that. He also sends a follow up to the

3431
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:47,080
email. Forgot to mention in my last email yesterday, my friend had a 16th birthday party

3432
02:21:47,080 --> 02:21:50,800
at John's incredible pizza. I know what a place for that. And I was wondering why have

3433
02:21:50,800 --> 02:21:53,720
you given it the title Johnson, incredibly shitty pizza. Wait, wait, we have somebody

3434
02:21:53,720 --> 02:21:57,960
here local that been to John's incredibly shitty pizza because those are only in Norcal

3435
02:21:57,960 --> 02:22:02,400
as far as I know, unless they really grew over grew fast. Well, did you eat the pizza

3436
02:22:02,400 --> 02:22:06,360
when you were there? It's kind of shitty and it's been sitting out for a long time and

3437
02:22:06,360 --> 02:22:10,920
little kids put their hands all over it and all that stuff. No, the place is okay. I mean,

3438
02:22:10,920 --> 02:22:14,880
actually I gotta say it was really cool cause one of the workers there once like recognize

3439
02:22:14,880 --> 02:22:18,800
this. I don't know how, but they did. And I thought that was really awesome. So Dan

3440
02:22:18,800 --> 02:22:23,040
was there too. Exactly. So, uh, you know, no, they're, they're fine. I have nothing

3441
02:22:23,040 --> 02:22:26,520
against John's incredible pizza, but it's a fun, you gotta admit pretty fun. The pizza

3442
02:22:26,520 --> 02:22:32,360
was pretty suck. All right, there you go. All right. Um, from Robert M from my last

3443
02:22:32,360 --> 02:22:36,960
email a month or two ago, I tried to be clever and use a reference to the spam filters used

3444
02:22:36,960 --> 02:22:40,520
on your forums discussion on the show. So my email was most likely lost to the spam

3445
02:22:40,520 --> 02:22:45,800
filters. Sorry about that. My question now is how long are the animations for the summons

3446
02:22:45,800 --> 02:22:50,240
for final fantasy 13 and can they be skipped? My brother back in the day generally enjoyed

3447
02:22:50,240 --> 02:22:54,240
final fantasy seven but was turned off by the summons taking about what, 10 to 15 seconds

3448
02:22:54,240 --> 02:22:58,840
every time, which can actually add up to get repetitive over the course of your typical

3449
02:22:58,840 --> 02:23:05,800
40 hour JRPG lifespan. Rob. Sorry, I'm focusing on tallying votes. What was the question?

3450
02:23:05,800 --> 02:23:11,760
I haven't seen it. How long are the, are the, are the, we have a shit ton of votes tonight.

3451
02:23:11,760 --> 02:23:16,240
How long are the summons scenes? Not very long. And no, I don't think you can, but they're

3452
02:23:16,240 --> 02:23:21,160
not very long. No, you can skip them. You can't get, Oh, okay. I wish you could skip

3453
02:23:21,160 --> 02:23:25,040
nights of the round. Seriously. When I would do nights of the round on quadra magic and

3454
02:23:25,040 --> 02:23:33,280
then mimic I had time to go make a sandwich, face myself a drink, come back, how that when

3455
02:23:33,280 --> 02:23:37,000
square heard all of the complaints about nights of the round for seven and they're like, how

3456
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:40,920
can we get around this for eight? They're like, Oh, I know. Let's make it so where you

3457
02:23:40,920 --> 02:23:45,360
have to watch the summit and tap square for the boost. Do you remember that? That was

3458
02:23:45,360 --> 02:23:52,280
their answer to that to make you watch it with the power up. Yeah, that was funny. Next

3459
02:23:52,280 --> 02:23:57,480
up, that's all part of the reason why I hated eight. Just so you know, this person didn't

3460
02:23:57,480 --> 02:24:02,480
sign it, so I'm just going to say person who didn't sign their email. Um, have been wondering,

3461
02:24:02,480 --> 02:24:06,120
have been enjoying the, or maybe I'll just use the first part of their email. Sepwin,

3462
02:24:06,120 --> 02:24:09,800
I guess. Um, I have been enjoying the show for a while. One comment about Microsoft's

3463
02:24:09,800 --> 02:24:14,800
project Natal. You mentioned one thing they showed were racing games. As someone who's

3464
02:24:14,800 --> 02:24:20,840
gotten heavy into sim racing games, I think that wouldn't work well even for arcade racers.

3465
02:24:20,840 --> 02:24:24,500
Main reason is there would be no rumble or force feedback to the player. For any racing

3466
02:24:24,500 --> 02:24:28,160
game that isn't meant to be a total arcade experience, a wheel with feedback, preferably

3467
02:24:28,160 --> 02:24:32,960
force feedback is critical. I would argue even burnout games need some sort of tactile

3468
02:24:32,960 --> 02:24:38,360
response to the player. Best wishes. I agree, actually. That's what I kind of like. Like,

3469
02:24:38,360 --> 02:24:46,480
what was it that, um, Rush had really crazy feedback? And it actually made it really fun

3470
02:24:46,480 --> 02:24:54,160
to play, I thought. You know, added a much bigger level into the control. Anyway, last

3471
02:24:54,160 --> 02:25:02,160
email. Um, subject, Rogue Kitty. Okay. All be aware President Katt has gone rogue. He

3472
02:25:02,160 --> 02:25:11,760
shall forever be known as Dictator Katt. Mwahahaha. Snow villagers. Okay. I guess. Oh, it came

3473
02:25:11,760 --> 02:25:23,280
with a picture. Oh, pfft. Hahahaha. War on string may be unwinnable, says General Katt.

3474
02:25:23,280 --> 02:25:30,360
That's funny. I'm gonna save the picture. I'll upload it somewhere. Perhaps our photo

3475
02:25:30,360 --> 02:25:39,760
thing. Perhaps. Anyway, that's the last of it. Ah, I'm not done telling votes yet, but

3476
02:25:39,760 --> 02:25:44,200
we have some more news to get to, right? Or no, we got the FUs of the week. Some angst.

3477
02:25:44,200 --> 02:25:48,080
Every week we like to take a little bit of our time out and get some angst out and some

3478
02:25:48,080 --> 02:25:52,040
anger. And hopefully there's enough of it tonight to, uh, get me through the rest of

3479
02:25:52,040 --> 02:25:56,280
the cage match votes. I keep saying cage match. Listless votes. Alright, uh, let's get to

3480
02:25:56,280 --> 02:26:21,960
the FUs of the week, boys and girls. Um, FU to my digestion. Really. That's it. Loki.

3481
02:26:21,960 --> 02:26:31,920
Um, I'm gonna have to say FU to, um, I don't really know. I don't have anything. I guess

3482
02:26:31,920 --> 02:26:39,640
the lawn being too long. I don't know. Uh, Alan, do you have an FU this week? FUs to

3483
02:26:39,640 --> 02:26:48,440
unemployment. Um, my FU goes to, um, all the boxes on my kitchen table. That's my FU of

3484
02:26:48,440 --> 02:26:52,760
the week. Alright. Uh, usually I would be doing the listless results right now, but

3485
02:26:52,760 --> 02:26:57,080
I'm not ready. We had so many tonight that I'm not ready. This is where I had it in our,

3486
02:26:57,080 --> 02:27:00,400
our list, but I'll have to jump in later. So, uh, Loki, would you do another story for

3487
02:27:00,400 --> 02:27:03,780
us please? By the way, we will be opening the Skype line in just a little bit, but we

3488
02:27:03,780 --> 02:27:09,480
have an interview with our friend Aaron in just a moment. So, uh, stay tuned. Yes. Um,

3489
02:27:09,480 --> 02:27:17,720
apparently bungee has reregistered or registered new trademarks for marathon and bungee aerospace.

3490
02:27:17,720 --> 02:27:23,760
Well marathon of course is their first FPS that they released way back in the day. Um,

3491
02:27:23,760 --> 02:27:29,560
so perhaps a new game in that series. Um, bungee aerospace, not exactly sure what the

3492
02:27:29,560 --> 02:27:37,640
hell that's about, but, um, it's interesting. They do have a logo though for bungee aerospace.

3493
02:27:37,640 --> 02:27:43,880
Perhaps, um, they're seeing a rebranding of the, of a studio or maybe they're gonna make

3494
02:27:43,880 --> 02:27:51,920
spaceships now. Who knows? Is this some type of like further halo thing or does this give

3495
02:27:51,920 --> 02:27:56,440
us some type of idea what they're actually going to be doing after halo? Not really.

3496
02:27:56,440 --> 02:28:01,400
Other than it being a trademark, I mean, obviously I would imagine marathon is going to be coming

3497
02:28:01,400 --> 02:28:06,040
at some point. Didn't they release marathon on Xbox live arcade and I don't remember it

3498
02:28:06,040 --> 02:28:11,600
being very good. I don't remember marathon. No, they did. They did. Yeah, it was, well,

3499
02:28:11,600 --> 02:28:22,120
you know, it was an old game. Whatever. Hmm. Would you mind doing the next story too? Cause

3500
02:28:22,120 --> 02:28:25,520
I'm still, I am still trying to tally votes. That's how many people we had voting tonight.

3501
02:28:25,520 --> 02:28:32,920
Throw in a beta code and that's what we got. Okay. Um, apparently the counter 64 is making

3502
02:28:32,920 --> 02:28:43,080
a return. Yes. Um, the, uh, a brand new, I guess, uh, a keyboard. Um, it looks like it's

3503
02:28:43,080 --> 02:28:52,560
all inclusive in this like keyboard. Um, based on they're saying the cybernet, uh, ZPC GX

3504
02:28:52,560 --> 02:29:02,120
31 and um, it's kinda cool looking a little futuristic thing. It's got a, I think a lot

3505
02:29:02,120 --> 02:29:06,320
of those pictures, I'm finally done. Sorry. I think a lot of those pictures were prototypes.

3506
02:29:06,320 --> 02:29:10,520
Like they're not the actual thing, especially like that one where you see the old ass system

3507
02:29:10,520 --> 02:29:16,160
running windows 95 or windows XP is, yeah, obviously a little bit silly, but dude, I'm

3508
02:29:16,160 --> 02:29:20,960
all about the counter 64 making a comeback cause there was some, that was like, I, again,

3509
02:29:20,960 --> 02:29:23,800
I'm hoping it's not something that I view in a greater light because it was when I was

3510
02:29:23,800 --> 02:29:27,440
young, but there were just some awesome programs on the 64 and I love the fact, here's the

3511
02:29:27,440 --> 02:29:32,240
number one reason the 64 was awesome. You could hook it up to your TV. That's why, that's

3512
02:29:32,240 --> 02:29:35,360
why I won the computer wars. I'm telling you, at least back in the eighties, the personal

3513
02:29:35,360 --> 02:29:42,480
computer wars before the IBM's. So that's kind of neat. All right. I'm finally ready.

3514
02:29:42,480 --> 02:29:45,840
By the way, if they re if they released a new Commodore 64, what do you think they should

3515
02:29:45,840 --> 02:29:53,400
put on it? I don't know. A bagel, a bunch of music making software would be good. Mario

3516
02:29:53,400 --> 02:29:59,920
paint put this way though, the counter 64 probably have more applications than an Apple

3517
02:29:59,920 --> 02:30:05,800
PC or an Apple home computer. Hopefully it would be backwards compatible. So let's get

3518
02:30:05,800 --> 02:30:14,440
to the list list results tonight. We're going to do the list list results. Play the music.

3519
02:30:14,440 --> 02:30:19,600
You voted in here. It is the definitive list of the ideas that Microsoft should steal and

3520
02:30:19,600 --> 02:30:24,200
make better. Here's your top three, by the way, just narrowly missing the list tonight

3521
02:30:24,200 --> 02:30:28,920
by one vote. Jesus, Jesus did not make the list. All right, but we have your top three

3522
02:30:28,920 --> 02:30:33,000
answers. We have a tie for third place, a tie for the number three thing you most want

3523
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:36,800
to see Microsoft improve on. By the way, this is it. There is no arguing. This is a very

3524
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:43,360
scientific process. Microsoft, if you're listening, here it is. Number three, the masses want

3525
02:30:43,360 --> 02:30:49,680
Pokemans. They want you to take the Pokemans and make them better and tied with that. You

3526
02:30:49,680 --> 02:30:53,800
might have to fry those Pokemans and the Colonel's secret recipe because you got to make that

3527
02:30:53,800 --> 02:31:00,260
better too. The Colonel's recipe and Pokemans tying for third place tonight. Second place

3528
02:31:00,260 --> 02:31:07,000
tonight, visual memory cards is what they want you to steal and make better. VMUs you

3529
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:12,960
take those and make them better. And lastly, the number one thing that Microsoft needs

3530
02:31:12,960 --> 02:31:20,880
to steal and make better, the PSP, a handheld system. That's right, Microsoft. We want a

3531
02:31:20,880 --> 02:31:25,600
handheld system as voted by our chatters. That's it. No arguing. We're done. Windows

3532
02:31:25,600 --> 02:31:30,960
mobile, not going to cut it. You need to steal the PSP and make it better. There are two

3533
02:31:30,960 --> 02:31:37,080
parts to this tonight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12

3534
02:31:37,080 --> 02:31:42,340
people want the beta. Oh no, 11 people want the beta code. Alan, pick a number between

3535
02:31:42,340 --> 02:31:50,960
one and 11. If you wouldn't mind. Four, four, one, two, three, four. Congratulations. Llama

3536
02:31:50,960 --> 02:31:56,880
juice wins one of our beta codes tonight. So we'll be sending him a beta code in a moment.

3537
02:31:56,880 --> 02:32:01,840
And um, let's see, pick a number between one and 11. That's not for dark Sakura. Pick a

3538
02:32:01,840 --> 02:32:06,960
number between one and 11. That's not four, eight, eight, one, two, three, four, five,

3539
02:32:06,960 --> 02:32:14,360
six, seven, eight. Amaze Satsuma wins a blur beta code. So congratulations to you guys.

3540
02:32:14,360 --> 02:32:19,640
Sorry to everyone else, but there it is. So llama juice and Amaze Satsuma win beta codes

3541
02:32:19,640 --> 02:32:24,360
just for voting and participating in the show tonight. You can too, Sunday nights at six

3542
02:32:24,360 --> 02:32:31,520
o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right at all games, radio, all games.com. All right.

3543
02:32:31,520 --> 02:32:38,680
We're going to get to the Skypline in a minute, although I was hoping to speak to Aaron, but

3544
02:32:38,680 --> 02:32:49,200
I closed the number with his phone number. When I was telling all the votes, I closed

3545
02:32:49,200 --> 02:32:54,840
the window, um, with his number. So now I'm waiting for it. Um, so there it is. So also

3546
02:32:54,840 --> 02:32:58,640
I need to send those codes. So I'm going to send those codes. Loki, do you have any quick

3547
02:32:58,640 --> 02:33:02,720
last minute stories to work in here while I wait to hopefully hear from Aaron?

3548
02:33:02,720 --> 02:33:09,160
Uh, Alan Wake, several download content episodes are due out this year. Uh, second season possibly

3549
02:33:09,160 --> 02:33:16,160
available depending on the audience. Um, I don't know if they buy it or not or how well

3550
02:33:16,160 --> 02:33:20,640
the first season does. That's kind of neat. Kind of reminds me of what they're doing with

3551
02:33:20,640 --> 02:33:24,520
a heavy rain. They're going to be releasing some demo content seasons for that. And of

3552
02:33:24,520 --> 02:33:34,720
course the game is, uh, set to hit shelves on May 18th on the Xbox 360. Uh, let's see

3553
02:33:34,720 --> 02:33:43,040
here. There, I don't know what they're doing with this, but, uh, their casting apparently

3554
02:33:43,040 --> 02:33:50,320
has been, um, released for the Kane and Lynch film and Kane, um, pretty cool. They're going

3555
02:33:50,320 --> 02:33:57,680
to have, uh, Bruce Willis to play, uh, Kane Lynch, however, is being played by Jamie Foxx,

3556
02:33:57,680 --> 02:34:06,720
who I might add looks absolutely nothing like the character of Lynch. Nothing. If you think

3557
02:34:06,720 --> 02:34:12,720
about it, not the be all racist or anything, but a black man playing the character named

3558
02:34:12,720 --> 02:34:20,160
Lynch is a little weird. If you ask me. Wow. Wow. I have no response for that at all. I'm

3559
02:34:20,160 --> 02:34:25,480
just saying. Okay. But seriously though, Jamie Foxx, great actor, but he looks nothing like

3560
02:34:25,480 --> 02:34:29,840
the character. Billy Bob Thornton looks more like the character. I think of course he's

3561
02:34:29,840 --> 02:34:34,520
a horrible actor. Well, at least now he's a horrible actor. Well, I think, you know,

3562
02:34:34,520 --> 02:34:38,120
with makeup and so forth, they'll give him the mullet and the glasses and everything

3563
02:34:38,120 --> 02:34:45,040
he needs. Look weird in the mulling glasses. I mean, he's, it's a different race. It's

3564
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:50,840
like as bad as the whole Chung Lee thing in the last street fighter movie. Not Asian.

3565
02:34:50,840 --> 02:34:55,840
Doesn't look anything like Chung Lee. Oh, and can act. By the way, bonds as double oh

3566
02:34:55,840 --> 02:35:02,880
six in chat says I am black myself and I say no. And into what Loki said, yes, yes, yes.

3567
02:35:02,880 --> 02:35:08,160
Same thing ran through my head. WTF. So maybe Loki is not as insensitive as real time. I

3568
02:35:08,160 --> 02:35:12,840
see the Prince of Persia trailer with Jake Gyllenhaal in the movie theater. Every time

3569
02:35:12,840 --> 02:35:18,240
I see that trailer, I just want to scream out, he's white, like to the theater. Just,

3570
02:35:18,240 --> 02:35:24,040
yeah, you should. I have to add, this is completely off topic here, but they finally released

3571
02:35:24,040 --> 02:35:29,920
the riff tracks for the new Twilight movie. I am very excited to watch that. Not that

3572
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:33,880
I'm excited to watch the Twilight movies, but the riff tracks were fucking hilarious

3573
02:35:33,880 --> 02:35:39,280
and we watched it with the happening. Oh my God. Completely different movie watching that

3574
02:35:39,280 --> 02:35:48,760
is just ridiculously funny. No phone number yet. No, I got it. I got it. I'm sorry. I

3575
02:35:48,760 --> 02:35:52,120
was just waiting for the conversation to finish because a good times. I like it when you say

3576
02:35:52,120 --> 02:35:55,720
things will get you in trouble. All right, so we're going to give our good buddy Aaron

3577
02:35:55,720 --> 02:36:01,120
also known as Y Y R a call because he's has a brand new game on the Xbox live marketplace

3578
02:36:01,120 --> 02:36:04,880
and the indie game section and we want to talk to him about it. So let's get him on

3579
02:36:04,880 --> 02:36:09,640
the line. We're going to call him on our Skype line right now and then we'll open up the

3580
02:36:09,640 --> 02:36:15,040
Skype line for anybody to call in at one eight seven seven. Hello. Hey Aaron, how you doing?

3581
02:36:15,040 --> 02:36:19,280
I figured it was you. Hey, how'd you know? It wasn't just the whole back and forth about

3582
02:36:19,280 --> 02:36:23,400
he ran off to get a drink at just the wrong moment. How you doing Aaron? Congratulations.

3583
02:36:23,400 --> 02:36:29,280
You released a game tonight. I am. I'm doing okay, which is pretty, pretty cool considering

3584
02:36:29,280 --> 02:36:35,520
this has been a bumpy ride. Um, you know, losing power from west Saturday night through

3585
02:36:35,520 --> 02:36:40,800
this Thursday evening and basically shacking up with my parents and doing all that I could

3586
02:36:40,800 --> 02:36:45,200
from there. I'm working on convention crap for most of the weekend and now I think I'm

3587
02:36:45,200 --> 02:36:50,720
coming down with a cold. Oh goody. Now that's right. You're going to be at PAX east, right?

3588
02:36:50,720 --> 02:36:55,840
Now you're showing off a snake 360 in your latest game in at a booth there. I'm going

3589
02:36:55,840 --> 02:37:01,840
to have all, um, I'm going to have all four of my, my games. Um, three of them will have

3590
02:37:01,840 --> 02:37:06,920
been released up to that point. And the fourth I thought would probably have been released,

3591
02:37:06,920 --> 02:37:13,560
but um, it's failed review on a technicality. So, um, it'll be coming next month and of

3592
02:37:13,560 --> 02:37:18,000
course anyone at PAX East is going to be able to try it first. So that's kind of pretty

3593
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:22,920
cool. So I'm going to turn it from a, well, it should have been out into a, it's coming

3594
02:37:22,920 --> 02:37:27,960
soon and you get to play it first. How cool is that? Hey, there you go. Hey, that's some,

3595
02:37:27,960 --> 02:37:31,360
some reason why people want to go to PAX is to play the games first. And by the way, Ziba

3596
02:37:31,360 --> 02:37:35,360
in our chat room is suggesting take some airborne, but as the 200 Matt says, it doesn't work.

3597
02:37:35,360 --> 02:37:39,960
So all right, well let's, let's talk about your latest game. So tonight on Xbox live

3598
02:37:39,960 --> 02:37:43,800
marketplace, you released a game called falling and we have a little clip so you can hear

3599
02:37:43,800 --> 02:37:53,280
some of the music. Now, as you can probably tell, this game is very retro inspired. In

3600
02:37:53,280 --> 02:37:58,400
fact, when I first looked at it, I was like, is this like a remake of pango or something?

3601
02:37:58,400 --> 02:38:01,760
But no, this just because the little guys look like penguins and they're moving around

3602
02:38:01,760 --> 02:38:06,640
blocks. This is something very different. I can tell, tell us a little bit about falling.

3603
02:38:06,640 --> 02:38:13,300
Well, um, basically what it kind of is, is it's a puzzle type game at its core. Um, what

3604
02:38:13,300 --> 02:38:17,280
you do is you're, you're playing the part of the penguin right there. Peppy, the penguin,

3605
02:38:17,280 --> 02:38:21,840
that's his name. And uh, you're running around and blocks are falling from the ceiling because

3606
02:38:21,840 --> 02:38:30,200
Wally the walrus is trying to get into your house. Okay. Damn that walrus. So what you

3607
02:38:30,200 --> 02:38:35,000
need to do is clean up the mess and then crush Wally before he causes trouble, which of course

3608
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:40,960
is touching you. You die. But you know, at first also Wally starts off stupid. He just

3609
02:38:40,960 --> 02:38:44,600
kind of walks back and forth and waits for you to crush him either by pushing a block

3610
02:38:44,600 --> 02:38:50,280
on him or, you know, um, dropping it on his head or whatever. But then later on he can

3611
02:38:50,280 --> 02:38:56,040
push blocks around, he can jump over things, he can kick blocks at your face, you know,

3612
02:38:56,040 --> 02:39:00,360
just generally make life miserable for you. So, you know, you gotta get rid of him and

3613
02:39:00,360 --> 02:39:04,080
you also have to clear the blocks by throwing or kicking the same colored blocks into each

3614
02:39:04,080 --> 02:39:11,680
other. So, you know, you're matching colors, you're avoiding walking walruses and, you

3615
02:39:11,680 --> 02:39:16,280
know, just generally things get pretty chaotic later in the game and it's fun. It's got the

3616
02:39:16,280 --> 02:39:22,880
retro vibe and, you know, it plays a lot like a frenetic arcade experience, you know. I

3617
02:39:22,880 --> 02:39:27,160
like to compare it to, you know, something like Bubble Bobble where it starts off simple

3618
02:39:27,160 --> 02:39:32,440
and then it just, it gets very complex and very action packed and, you know, it, I feel

3619
02:39:32,440 --> 02:39:39,400
it does have the kind of lasting enjoyment that a game like that, you know, used to have.

3620
02:39:39,400 --> 02:39:43,720
I think I pretty much captured that spirit. It definitely looks like something that could

3621
02:39:43,720 --> 02:39:49,080
be from Game Room. It's kind of that old kind of retro look to it. It seems like this game

3622
02:39:49,080 --> 02:39:54,560
is coming out just in time, honestly, for everything. So. Yeah, well, I mean, I hope

3623
02:39:54,560 --> 02:39:59,040
people download it and they, you know, they get the same kind of feelings that they get

3624
02:39:59,040 --> 02:40:05,000
when they play one of their favorite old games and then I hope they buy it. So you can't

3625
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,920
get the trial in the marketplace right now. I'm going to go ahead and let the, oh, you

3626
02:40:07,920 --> 02:40:11,520
have several videos up here on YouTube, don't you? You have like an attract mode, some other

3627
02:40:11,520 --> 02:40:16,200
gameplay clips. Let's try one of these other clips here on the YouTube. Now you posted

3628
02:40:16,200 --> 02:40:20,280
some clips of the game. This is round 10. We're going to look at analysis as I'm imagining

3629
02:40:20,280 --> 02:40:24,120
things get a little more intense in this level, the bricks fall faster. Actually, I was playing

3630
02:40:24,120 --> 02:40:29,080
on hard difficulty when I made that video, so it's kind of nuts. I don't think, I think

3631
02:40:29,080 --> 02:40:34,160
that video ends with my death actually. Now there's multiple, there's walrai, there's

3632
02:40:34,160 --> 02:40:40,600
multiple walruses. Oh yeah, they come in packs. Oh my gosh. They're like real walruses. Actually,

3633
02:40:40,600 --> 02:40:44,520
I'm not basing that statement on any fact whatsoever. Okay, I've got to ask you, this

3634
02:40:44,520 --> 02:40:49,120
seems like the most obvious question. Where did the inspiration for a game like this come

3635
02:40:49,120 --> 02:40:53,760
from? Where did this come to you in like a dream or something? Like dude's going to,

3636
02:40:53,760 --> 02:40:57,600
penguin's going to get his home invaded by walruses. Like where the hell did you come

3637
02:40:57,600 --> 02:41:05,040
up with this? Well, to be completely honest, um, the, the entire concept for the game started

3638
02:41:05,040 --> 02:41:13,040
with my, I guess now ex-fiancee's, um, you know, obsession with Piplup. That is, that

3639
02:41:13,040 --> 02:41:19,160
is completely true. And I wanted to make a game with a penguin in it and I thought, okay,

3640
02:41:19,160 --> 02:41:22,760
blocks are falling from the ceiling. And then I thought, okay, something has to come and

3641
02:41:22,760 --> 02:41:27,240
be an antagonist. And then, you know, I figured, well, you know, I think I heard somewhere

3642
02:41:27,240 --> 02:41:32,840
that walruses in real life don't like penguins. So I started going with that. And then when

3643
02:41:32,840 --> 02:41:38,080
I had already drawn all the sprites, I decided to actually look this up. And according to

3644
02:41:38,080 --> 02:41:43,480
stuff I found on Wikipedia, the simple fact of the matter is due to differences in their

3645
02:41:43,480 --> 02:41:49,160
habitats, walruses and penguins in real life basically never see each other. So I went

3646
02:41:49,160 --> 02:41:53,000
with it anyway. So you found out that walruses and penguins were like mortal enemies and

3647
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:58,240
you're like, there's a game there. Yes, yes, exactly. Now I'm looking at this, you have

3648
02:41:58,240 --> 02:42:01,520
another video on YouTube and you can see these videos by the way, uh, listeners by going

3649
02:42:01,520 --> 02:42:08,520
to the website for Aaron's games. It's yyrgames.com. That's all one word, yyrgames.com. And I'm

3650
02:42:08,520 --> 02:42:12,200
looking at kind of like the attract mode that shows you how to play the game, but I noticed

3651
02:42:12,200 --> 02:42:17,160
you have it set up. Like it looks like you're playing a ROM and MAME or something. Is that,

3652
02:42:17,160 --> 02:42:21,000
what made you decide to go for that? That's exactly what I was going for. Is there a reason

3653
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:25,040
for that? You were just like, I want to make my game feel like a MAME ROM or you know,

3654
02:42:25,040 --> 02:42:29,560
you just wanted to kind of enhance that retro vibe this game has going for it or what? I

3655
02:42:29,560 --> 02:42:33,360
totally just basically wanted to make it feel like an old arcade game. From the moment you

3656
02:42:33,360 --> 02:42:37,640
power up the machine and you see the ROM test and you know, it puts the option settings

3657
02:42:37,640 --> 02:42:43,200
on the screen for a fraction of a second to going into the options and being able to adjust

3658
02:42:43,200 --> 02:42:49,960
how many coins the game costs. You know, it's all in there. Nice. But no real coins. It's

3659
02:42:49,960 --> 02:42:53,320
much different than game room where game room charges you 50 cents a play, but that won't

3660
02:42:53,320 --> 02:42:59,600
happen here, right? No, no. You can try it for free, just like all indie games. And uh,

3661
02:42:59,600 --> 02:43:04,920
if you spend 80 space bucks, just 80 space bucks, you can play it as much as you want

3662
02:43:04,920 --> 02:43:12,640
for as long as you want. I think I caught, how many space bucks was that? 80. $1. $1?

3663
02:43:12,640 --> 02:43:16,000
That's a steal. That's great. Now what is this? I noticed, I just caught this briefly

3664
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:20,420
at the end of the attract screen here, that when it's showing the high score table, it

3665
02:43:20,420 --> 02:43:29,200
looks like the default scores say import Futari now. What is that? Oh, nothing. No, that's

3666
02:43:29,200 --> 02:43:36,280
a direct reference to Mushihime from off Futari, the cave shooting game released last year.

3667
02:43:36,280 --> 02:43:40,600
Actually there's another game that I'm releasing soon called Sharpshooter and I make a reference

3668
02:43:40,600 --> 02:43:46,720
to DJ Max Technica and its high score tables. I'm all about referencing other games, other

3669
02:43:46,720 --> 02:43:54,000
stuff. In fact, before we end this conversation, I would like to actually directly reference

3670
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:58,200
one of the in-game references that I have actually in all my games and I'm turning that

3671
02:43:58,200 --> 02:44:06,460
into a giveaway for three of our chat rumors. Okay. So what, the chatters have to know what

3672
02:44:06,460 --> 02:44:10,800
it is that all your games have in common or what? What's the deal? Well, do you want to

3673
02:44:10,800 --> 02:44:20,600
do it now? Sure. Why not? Okay. Well, in every game that I've released so far, Snake 360,

3674
02:44:20,600 --> 02:44:25,800
Card Arcade, Falling, and also in the game that I'm releasing next month, Sharpshooter,

3675
02:44:25,800 --> 02:44:29,640
and by the way, all those games will be on display at PAX East and I hope that everyone

3676
02:44:29,640 --> 02:44:34,320
who comes to PAX East will come to our booth and have a really great time. I'm going to

3677
02:44:34,320 --> 02:44:39,120
be next to Mommy's Best Games and they're going to have a bunch of great stuff too including

3678
02:44:39,120 --> 02:44:45,200
an unreleased game called Grapple Buggy. So, you know, come, play the games. I'm going

3679
02:44:45,200 --> 02:44:51,040
to be running Snake 360 tournaments all weekend long. You can compete for prizes, t-shirts,

3680
02:44:51,040 --> 02:44:57,560
soundtracks, CDs, like I decided to go all out with this. So, but at any rate, no it's

3681
02:44:57,560 --> 02:45:04,560
not O-L-O-R-G related. Thank you, chat. But I will absolutely stop by the booth. Absolutely

3682
02:45:04,560 --> 02:45:09,400
I'll be stopping by to say hello. I am looking forward to meeting you. Absolutely I'll be

3683
02:45:09,400 --> 02:45:12,000
by. I don't know what I'm wearing yet. Everybody's asking me what are you wearing so I can like

3684
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:18,360
see, spot you and see you. I don't know. I was hoping to have my frilly orange scarf

3685
02:45:18,360 --> 02:45:22,520
but it looks like I'll have to save that for PAX Prime. I have this thing called homework.

3686
02:45:22,520 --> 02:45:26,560
I know. I know. Bakers can't be choosers. But I'll find something creative. Well, I

3687
02:45:26,560 --> 02:45:30,200
know, I know my friend Amanda plans to wear a corset one day so I was thinking well I

3688
02:45:30,200 --> 02:45:34,200
could wear a corset. But I don't know how well that would go over. So, we'll have to

3689
02:45:34,200 --> 02:45:39,440
see. I'll, stay tuned to the Twitter folks. I'll let you know. Alright, but anyway, back

3690
02:45:39,440 --> 02:45:47,440
to the giveaway. Yes. So, in all of the games that I'm, that I have released or am releasing,

3691
02:45:47,440 --> 02:45:52,520
I have a number in there. It's usually in the form of in one of the high score numbers

3692
02:45:52,520 --> 02:45:57,520
and it's a direct reference to a video game company. The first three people to type it

3693
02:45:57,520 --> 02:46:05,320
into chat get a code to download falling for free. Woo hoo. Free falling. Save, save that

3694
02:46:05,320 --> 02:46:10,920
dollar by typing that number into chat right now. So, and. Not the number. I don't need

3695
02:46:10,920 --> 02:46:15,160
the number. I need the video game company that I reference. Oops, my bad. It's not Konami.

3696
02:46:15,160 --> 02:46:20,800
My bad. The video game company he references and he flat out has told you it is not Konami.

3697
02:46:20,800 --> 02:46:26,200
So, go ahead and guess. There it is. And you know what? And you know what? If, yeah, I'm

3698
02:46:26,200 --> 02:46:32,760
not seeing it yet, so I'm just gonna say what the number is. Okay. It's 765. I'm trying

3699
02:46:32,760 --> 02:46:38,160
to think what that reference is. It's gotta be like a. 765. It's gotta be, it's probably

3700
02:46:38,160 --> 02:46:45,480
very similar to the whole 573 thing. It's. It's not Konami. It's not Bungie. Me, me.

3701
02:46:45,480 --> 02:46:52,360
I see it. I'm waiting for two other people to say it before I confirm it. What, what's

3702
02:46:52,360 --> 02:46:58,200
the list of what it's not? It's not Konami. And the number is 765. Okay, three people

3703
02:46:58,200 --> 02:47:02,800
wrote Namco. We're done. Oh, Namco. Tell us a little more about the reference to Namco.

3704
02:47:02,800 --> 02:47:11,040
Yes, I am basically a Namco fangirl. Uh huh. So many of Namco's games are on my all time

3705
02:47:11,040 --> 02:47:17,280
list of favorites that I couldn't possibly not be a Namco fangirl. So I'm basically referencing

3706
02:47:17,280 --> 02:47:23,360
them in, well, everything. Nice. And you know what? Hey, hey, I will say this. I, you know,

3707
02:47:23,360 --> 02:47:27,480
we've, we've had our creative differences with Namco in the past. I'll just leave it

3708
02:47:27,480 --> 02:47:33,000
that way. But I will say this. This made me a giddy little fangirl as well is that in,

3709
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:36,580
and I apologize for the listeners that have heard this story 5,000 times, but you know

3710
02:47:36,580 --> 02:47:43,320
I love this story. In the Namco PS3 game, the Namco Treasures Volume 1, there is a direct

3711
02:47:43,320 --> 02:47:48,560
OLR reference like in your face. It, it, when you go in, yes, when you go into the game,

3712
02:47:48,560 --> 02:47:51,720
it's, and it has to be the full version. It doesn't work in the demo. So you have to buy

3713
02:47:51,720 --> 02:47:56,820
the full version. But when you go in, there's a splash screen that shows like a sample cause

3714
02:47:56,820 --> 02:48:00,720
it's just showing off the new online features and there's a demo high score table and like

3715
02:48:00,720 --> 02:48:05,560
friends list and you see OLR in the high score table and then the person's friends list is

3716
02:48:05,560 --> 02:48:10,680
Sky, Dark Soccer, and Loki. Oh wow, I gotta go run and check that right now. No kitty,

3717
02:48:10,680 --> 02:48:15,080
it's on the PS3 and it's the Namco Treasures Volume 1. It's the one that has like Pac-Man

3718
02:48:15,080 --> 02:48:18,720
and, and all that stuff. I think I actually downloaded that. I, I don't know if I still

3719
02:48:18,720 --> 02:48:22,360
have it on the hard drive, but it's not. I'm getting it again. But it's not in the demo.

3720
02:48:22,360 --> 02:48:25,040
I just want to make that clear. You will not see it in the demo. That splash screen is

3721
02:48:25,040 --> 02:48:29,560
only in the full version. Cause the way the PS3 works is funky. Your demo is like completely

3722
02:48:29,560 --> 02:48:33,440
separate from your regular game. It's not like the 360 where you upgrade. Yeah, I know.

3723
02:48:33,440 --> 02:48:39,000
I'm not happy about it either. Yeah. So again, if you hadn't heard that story before, I love

3724
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:44,640
that story so much. I totally support that. That's when you know you made it. We've been

3725
02:48:44,640 --> 02:48:49,800
doing this show for eight years to get our name in a video game was amazing. So we were

3726
02:48:49,800 --> 02:48:54,080
very happy about that. Well, Aaron, I want to wish you the best of luck with your release.

3727
02:48:54,080 --> 02:48:58,720
And again, if our chatters want to stay on top of your releases, Y Y R games.com real

3728
02:48:58,720 --> 02:49:02,880
quick, cause I wanted to ask this at some point, how long does it take you to make these

3729
02:49:02,880 --> 02:49:08,520
games? Give us an idea. How long did falling take? Start to finish. I started falling.

3730
02:49:08,520 --> 02:49:16,640
I'd say probably around September or October of last year. And now granted I was working

3731
02:49:16,640 --> 02:49:21,600
on sharpshooter, which is my release for next month at the same time. And by the way, if

3732
02:49:21,600 --> 02:49:26,000
you're developing a game, I would very, very strongly recommend that you never, ever try

3733
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:31,520
to work on two at the same time, because as with most things, it'll probably wind up taking

3734
02:49:31,520 --> 02:49:36,440
you longer, you know, to finish both than if you just did one and then the other. But

3735
02:49:36,440 --> 02:49:41,640
yeah, it, it does take a while because you know, it's, you could have a basic version

3736
02:49:41,640 --> 02:49:45,720
of the game up and running very quickly, but if you really want to polish it, if you want

3737
02:49:45,720 --> 02:49:49,960
to, you know, take the time to work out all the kinks, if you want to have great sound

3738
02:49:49,960 --> 02:49:56,560
effects, music, graphics, every, every bit of it needs time spent on it. So, you know,

3739
02:49:56,560 --> 02:50:02,960
if you really, really have to spend a whole lot of time and effort on it. So, you know,

3740
02:50:02,960 --> 02:50:07,120
one thing I say to people, people really just don't realize how much time goes into a game.

3741
02:50:07,120 --> 02:50:11,400
The next time you're walking through a 3d environment and a first person shooter, you

3742
02:50:11,400 --> 02:50:18,720
know, don't just run past that, that intricately designed building and never look at it again.

3743
02:50:18,720 --> 02:50:23,280
You know, actually take the time to look at it and admire what, you know, a bunch of designers

3744
02:50:23,280 --> 02:50:29,440
worked on because they spent hours on that and we run past it in five seconds. It's amazing

3745
02:50:29,440 --> 02:50:33,440
all the detail that goes into that type of work. It's kind of like a movie. There's,

3746
02:50:33,440 --> 02:50:36,640
you know, the list of credits at the end of the movie, it really does take that many people

3747
02:50:36,640 --> 02:50:44,080
to make a movie, but this game falling was made by one guy, right? There it is. Well,

3748
02:50:44,080 --> 02:50:48,800
Aaron, good luck. I hope your hard work pays off guys. If you have the dollar, just go,

3749
02:50:48,800 --> 02:50:53,760
go spend the dollar, go support some indie gamers, go check it out on the Xbox live indie

3750
02:50:53,760 --> 02:50:58,760
marketplace falling snake three lucky winners. Watch your PMs. All right. And if you want

3751
02:50:58,760 --> 02:51:04,440
to follow Aaron, the website, yyrgames.com congrats on the release, Aaron. And, uh, I

3752
02:51:04,440 --> 02:51:09,440
hope you make some money. Oh, uh, I'm, I'm just looking to get my name out there and

3753
02:51:09,440 --> 02:51:14,960
maybe make enough to someday do this for a living. I'm not looking to make a fortune

3754
02:51:14,960 --> 02:51:19,520
or anything. Sounds, that sounds like a fair compromise. We'll see you at PAX East Aaron.

3755
02:51:19,520 --> 02:51:23,480
All right. You see that? All right. I'll probably be assaulting you with a microphone there

3756
02:51:23,480 --> 02:51:28,160
too. Just so you know. That's just fine. All right. Good luck. See you at the show. See

3757
02:51:28,160 --> 02:51:34,040
you later later. Aaron also known as yyr from yyrgames.com and a yeah, a little reminder

3758
02:51:34,040 --> 02:51:38,840
in our chat room. And, uh, this is also important. Speaking of indie games, uh, Bobby references

3759
02:51:38,840 --> 02:51:43,640
on his show earlier, but, uh, our, um, podcasting friends at a dead pixel live, they're another

3760
02:51:43,640 --> 02:51:48,960
all game show. Uh, the guy there, Derek, he develops indie games too, and he put one out

3761
02:51:48,960 --> 02:51:54,120
not that long ago called you will die. Well, apparently it is now the first Xbox live indie

3762
02:51:54,120 --> 02:51:59,280
game to have an official twin galaxy scoreboard, which I think is kind of interesting. So,

3763
02:51:59,280 --> 02:52:04,240
uh, yeah, that's, that's very cool. So congratulations to Derek on that accomplishment. Who knows?

3764
02:52:04,240 --> 02:52:08,600
Maybe falling being a retro game could, could be next. Who knows? We'll see. I don't know

3765
02:52:08,600 --> 02:52:11,800
if that'll open the flood gates, but, uh, congrats to all of our friends that are indie

3766
02:52:11,800 --> 02:52:15,520
developers, man. That takes, it takes a lot of work. Like I wish I had that kind of talent.

3767
02:52:15,520 --> 02:52:20,180
I would make an OLR game. I think that would be fun, but we'll see. All right. Are we ready

3768
02:52:20,180 --> 02:52:24,680
to go to the phones and take some calls tonight? Why not? I think so. We're only going to take

3769
02:52:24,680 --> 02:52:28,520
a couple of calls tonight, guys. I apologize to those that don't get through tonight. We

3770
02:52:28,520 --> 02:52:34,080
just, uh, we got a lot of show done tonight. So, uh, one eight seven seven game. OLR is

3771
02:52:34,080 --> 02:52:38,160
the number to call or our username on Skype is orange lounge radio. Loki real quick. Did

3772
02:52:38,160 --> 02:52:41,760
you have any other last minute stories before we, um, get to the phones? Yeah, there's this

3773
02:52:41,760 --> 02:52:45,920
new game. It's a new music game coming out called power gig rise of the six string, which

3774
02:52:45,920 --> 02:52:51,160
kind of neat about it is it actually uses a guitar controller that is a real electric

3775
02:52:51,160 --> 02:52:54,880
guitar. You can convert it into, well, you plug in an amp into it and it's a real electric

3776
02:52:54,880 --> 02:52:59,280
guitar, but it will teach you how to play a guitar. By the way, YYR wants to say he

3777
02:52:59,280 --> 02:53:03,640
is running a high score contest on falling and you have to check YYR games.com for more

3778
02:53:03,640 --> 02:53:09,320
details. Our phone lines are like flooded. I'm just going to take a call here and we're

3779
02:53:09,320 --> 02:53:14,080
going to go ahead and go to the phones. Hi, you're on. Whoa. I see webcam. We don't get

3780
02:53:14,080 --> 02:53:19,200
those calls much higher on orange launch radio. Who's this? Howdy. This is llama juice. Hey,

3781
02:53:19,200 --> 02:53:25,000
llama juice. Congrats. You won the blur beta, right? Yes, I did have fun with that. Good

3782
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:29,880
luck with that. All right. Hopefully your video doesn't screw up our, um, bandwidth,

3783
02:53:29,880 --> 02:53:32,680
but we'll see what happens. Oh no, he shut it off. All right. That's all right. What's

3784
02:53:32,680 --> 02:53:37,840
up? What's up llama juice? No, that's okay. It's cool. What's on your mind? I went down

3785
02:53:37,840 --> 02:53:45,800
to a GDC in San Francisco, uh, last week ish. Yeah. And uh, I, I don't know if you guys

3786
02:53:45,800 --> 02:53:50,520
like, I, I, I got to the show late last week, so I didn't get to hear about anything you

3787
02:53:50,520 --> 02:53:53,840
guys were talking about. No, we didn't go to the show, which is funny because we're

3788
02:53:53,840 --> 02:53:57,320
not that, you must be in the area cause we're, we're just in Sacramento, so we're not that

3789
02:53:57,320 --> 02:54:01,880
far from San Francisco. In fact, Alan is from there, so I go there all of the time and I

3790
02:54:01,880 --> 02:54:07,000
was there that weekend. But uh, you know, GDC, they don't really let media people in,

3791
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:12,360
so I didn't go. They actually do have media passes. You, you should, you should try that

3792
02:54:12,360 --> 02:54:16,780
next time. Yeah, but unfortunately it's kind of one of those double edged swords. Indie

3793
02:54:16,780 --> 02:54:23,280
podcasters aren't really a media enough for a them. Fair enough. So you have to work for

3794
02:54:23,280 --> 02:54:29,240
IGN or well, I guess I guess the media passes will be opening up next time. All right. Uh,

3795
02:54:29,240 --> 02:54:34,760
so what, how, how was GDC? What'd you think? Um, the conference itself was really awesome.

3796
02:54:34,760 --> 02:54:41,320
I'm an environment artist trying to try to get a job. So for, to go there, it was basically

3797
02:54:41,320 --> 02:54:46,280
a giant job fair, you know, with all the big companies and whatnot trying to, trying to

3798
02:54:46,280 --> 02:54:54,640
hire people. Um, but what was neat is that like all of the, all of the different, uh,

3799
02:54:54,640 --> 02:55:02,040
like Sony and Microsoft had booths there too showing off all their stuff and uh, Sony was

3800
02:55:02,040 --> 02:55:07,760
showing off their, their PlayStation move. Did you get your hands on it? Yes. Ah, I want

3801
02:55:07,760 --> 02:55:11,920
to know what you thought then. I definitely want to know what you thought of move. Um,

3802
02:55:11,920 --> 02:55:15,840
I was out opening day picking up the week, you know, I was out there waiting outside

3803
02:55:15,840 --> 02:55:24,100
for 14 hours and uh, the, the move puts the weed of shame hands down. Wow. The controls

3804
02:55:24,100 --> 02:55:32,760
for it were extremely responsive. Um, the, the demos that they showed were, it was a

3805
02:55:32,760 --> 02:55:38,840
lot of, um, really, really cheesy stuff. Like there was a little game with where you made

3806
02:55:38,840 --> 02:55:45,920
bubbles and a monkey tried to pop the bubbles. But, uh, as far as like the controlling of

3807
02:55:45,920 --> 02:55:53,400
it all went, it like, it was very one to one, very, very quick and responsive. Is that all

3808
02:55:53,400 --> 02:55:57,540
you played was the monkey bubble game or were there other stuff you got to check out? There

3809
02:55:57,540 --> 02:56:03,080
was the monkey bubble game. There was like the, that tech demo that they showed at E3,

3810
02:56:03,080 --> 02:56:07,760
like right when they showed it off, they had that there. Um, and then they had some other

3811
02:56:07,760 --> 02:56:13,520
game that I watched some girl play where she was like swinging some swords and mallets

3812
02:56:13,520 --> 02:56:19,600
or something around and she was getting really into it and it looked like it was very responsive

3813
02:56:19,600 --> 02:56:27,840
as to what she was doing and, and all that. Um, they were showing that, uh, if you have

3814
02:56:27,840 --> 02:56:33,320
the two controllers, it actually, the camera itself can actually do face tracking as well.

3815
02:56:33,320 --> 02:56:39,880
Oh wow. And so the, the camera can like see your face and the two remotes and then guess

3816
02:56:39,880 --> 02:56:46,560
where your arms are and all that. And so it can do like full bot or it tries to do like,

3817
02:56:46,560 --> 02:56:51,040
um, sensing, you know, where your body is. And so if you're docking and stuff like that,

3818
02:56:51,040 --> 02:56:56,180
it can, it can try to replicate that with a character on screen. Interesting. So it's

3819
02:56:56,180 --> 02:56:59,400
got a little bit of that because that's kind of the stuff that they're selling when the

3820
02:56:59,400 --> 02:57:02,200
tall. So it's interesting to hear that move kind of has a little bit of that built in.

3821
02:57:02,200 --> 02:57:06,640
So I think a lot of us are thinking of it as only a we rip off right now. So to hear

3822
02:57:06,640 --> 02:57:10,400
that it's got a little additional camera features is kind of cool. I will tell you something

3823
02:57:10,400 --> 02:57:13,840
though that when we were talking about this last week, I think one place where we were

3824
02:57:13,840 --> 02:57:19,640
critical of move, although, you know, I think we all see it as a logical step for Sony and

3825
02:57:19,640 --> 02:57:23,920
we all know they've had more time now to perfect the technology. So it better be better. But

3826
02:57:23,920 --> 02:57:28,600
the big question is, does it have the games to substantiate it? Because you know, if it's

3827
02:57:28,600 --> 02:57:33,280
just another bunch of little mini party games and so forth, then what's the point? Do you

3828
02:57:33,280 --> 02:57:38,720
think from what you observed that move has the, let's just go back to the old OLR golden

3829
02:57:38,720 --> 02:57:43,920
rule rule of a video game system is only as good as the games that are on it. Do you think

3830
02:57:43,920 --> 02:57:50,400
that move has the games to substantiate the controller?

3831
02:57:50,400 --> 02:57:55,960
From what they showed at GDC, they really only showed one game, like one full game with

3832
02:57:55,960 --> 02:58:02,320
it. And I didn't really see much of it. But I was talking to the guy that like the main

3833
02:58:02,320 --> 02:58:07,360
main guy behind the whole technology of it all. And he was saying that new SOCOM that's

3834
02:58:07,360 --> 02:58:15,240
going to be coming out is going to be using it very in depth. And so he's saying that,

3835
02:58:15,240 --> 02:58:20,000
you know, the controls for that are going to be pretty sweet. So if SOCOM is going to

3836
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:29,760
be using it, I guess that's a really big title for Sony. I don't have a PS3. So I don't know.

3837
02:58:29,760 --> 02:58:36,960
Then even better, is this the type of peripheral that makes you want to get one?

3838
02:58:36,960 --> 02:58:42,280
And I've always been a sucker for the gimmicky, gimmicky crap in games. Like, you know, I

3839
02:58:42,280 --> 02:58:48,080
have all of, like I had, I got the Game Boy printer, the e-reader, you know, I bought

3840
02:58:48,080 --> 02:58:55,160
the Wii opening day, all that kind of stuff. And so this, this kind of thing, it, it does

3841
02:58:55,160 --> 02:59:04,960
make me want to buy a PS3. The guy said that as far as prices, the unit's going to come

3842
02:59:04,960 --> 02:59:11,000
out with a controller, a game, and the camera all under a hundred dollars when it comes

3843
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:12,000
out.

3844
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:14,600
Yeah, I remember that. They did have a little press conference. They said some of that,

3845
02:59:14,600 --> 02:59:17,320
but yeah, I wonder what, I wonder if it's going to be the Monkey Bubble game or what

3846
02:59:17,320 --> 02:59:23,500
it's going to be. So we'll see. Well, real quickly before we let you go, because we want

3847
02:59:23,500 --> 02:59:27,120
to try to get at least one more call tonight. Were there any other quick thoughts you had

3848
02:59:27,120 --> 02:59:30,720
about GDC or something like really interesting? Did you attend any panels or I don't know

3849
02:59:30,720 --> 02:59:34,200
if they call them panels or seminars or what have you, that you just thought were awesome

3850
02:59:34,200 --> 02:59:35,800
and you want to share?

3851
02:59:35,800 --> 02:59:41,560
Um, sadly I didn't get to go to any of the, they, they call them summits there. Um, I

3852
02:59:41,560 --> 02:59:47,880
didn't get to go to any of those because I got the cheap pass, which was still $250 plus

3853
02:59:47,880 --> 02:59:53,560
I live in Orlando, so, uh, I didn't really have the extra.

3854
02:59:53,560 --> 02:59:57,720
Oh, you came all the way out here just for that then. Wow. Cool.

3855
02:59:57,720 --> 03:00:05,760
Um, but what I will say is if you don't mind a little, a little plug here, um, I did a

3856
03:00:05,760 --> 03:00:12,040
vlog every day as I was out there, recorded anything fun that I saw at the expo. Um, if

3857
03:00:12,040 --> 03:00:16,520
you want to see any, if you want to see any of that, uh, I have a YouTube channel, uh,

3858
03:00:16,520 --> 03:00:23,600
youtube.com slash llama juice, all one word. Um, so if you go there, you can see a lot

3859
03:00:23,600 --> 03:00:27,640
of the, a lot of the cool stuff that they had at the expo. They had a lot of virtual

3860
03:00:27,640 --> 03:00:35,920
reality stuff going on. Um, a lot of 3d like glasses with gaming. Um, a lot of stuff like

3861
03:00:35,920 --> 03:00:39,400
that going on. It was some, some pretty cool technology going on there.

3862
03:00:39,400 --> 03:00:43,600
All right. So check that out on youtube. Uh, we'll go, we'll go ahead and let you plug

3863
03:00:43,600 --> 03:00:46,480
that, especially cause we weren't out there ourselves. So I might actually be going to

3864
03:00:46,480 --> 03:00:50,040
look and see what it was like out there on the show floor. So llama juice, good luck

3865
03:00:50,040 --> 03:00:55,280
with blur. Good luck with your schooling for all the environmental stuff. And, uh, we'll

3866
03:00:55,280 --> 03:01:00,880
see you later on the show. Okay. Sounds like a plan. All right. Take care, buddy. Yep.

3867
03:01:00,880 --> 03:01:05,960
You too. Later. We'll take like one more call guys. And I really apologize in advance for

3868
03:01:05,960 --> 03:01:08,520
those folks that don't get through tonight. Please, please, please don't be afraid to

3869
03:01:08,520 --> 03:01:13,100
send us an email, send us some tweets. Uh, one of the other ways. It's just that our

3870
03:01:13,100 --> 03:01:17,520
show is running really long tonight. So, uh, we wanted to just take a couple more calls.

3871
03:01:17,520 --> 03:01:20,560
You guys, I'm just gonna take this first one here. Hi, you're on orange on radio. Who's

3872
03:01:20,560 --> 03:01:26,240
this? Good morning. This is G that's calling him. Hi, G that's. Oh, it's the other Swede,

3873
03:01:26,240 --> 03:01:32,640
right? Oh yes. How are you? My friend. How's it going? Uh, I'm not too bad. A bit tired.

3874
03:01:32,640 --> 03:01:39,040
I've been up since two AM. That is hardcore. My friends hardcore. I really appreciate your

3875
03:01:39,040 --> 03:01:43,040
support. Well, what's on your mind, please. You stayed up late to talk to us. What's up?

3876
03:01:43,040 --> 03:01:47,720
Uh, you already talked about it, I think, but I just want to talk a bit more about Cave

3877
03:01:47,720 --> 03:01:52,800
Story and its awesomeness. If you haven't played it, you really, really need to play

3878
03:01:52,800 --> 03:01:57,660
it because it's freeware on PC and if you really like it on PC, you can always buy it

3879
03:01:57,660 --> 03:02:02,480
on WiiWare because he really deserves it. It's just one guy who made one of the most

3880
03:02:02,480 --> 03:02:10,480
awesome games ever. Now, where, where can people get this game? Uh, I think there's

3881
03:02:10,480 --> 03:02:15,720
a different, like a tribute site that has a download with an English patch because the

3882
03:02:15,720 --> 03:02:20,420
guy who made it is Japanese. Oh, okay. But I don't, I don't think he has his own like

3883
03:02:20,420 --> 03:02:24,600
developer site. It's Studio Pixel, I think he calls himself. He's usually just referred

3884
03:02:24,600 --> 03:02:29,880
to as Pixel. Now, what is it about this game that just made you fall in love with it? Uh,

3885
03:02:29,880 --> 03:02:36,040
it's sort of retro, the music's awesome, the story's actually kind of entertaining and

3886
03:02:36,040 --> 03:02:41,840
it has a, has a couple of twists. It's not your usual Mario, oh, the princess is in another

3887
03:02:41,840 --> 03:02:46,920
castle. You can't really predict what's going to happen. And it's just an unexplored fantasy

3888
03:02:46,920 --> 03:02:55,080
world that you've never seen before. And I like the price of free. That's good. Has anybody

3889
03:02:55,080 --> 03:02:58,360
been able to like follow the guy? I know there's like the language differences, but has anybody

3890
03:02:58,360 --> 03:03:02,000
been able to follow the guy and see if there's a chance of this, like, I don't know, being

3891
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:09,280
an indie game on Xbox Live or coming out somewhere else besides just the PC? I'm not sure. It

3892
03:03:09,280 --> 03:03:16,160
is coming out on, on WiiWare and I think they had like a report on the Wii channel with

3893
03:03:16,160 --> 03:03:23,400
him and the American developers who met with him and like made the port. But I'm not sure,

3894
03:03:23,400 --> 03:03:27,880
maybe they have like an exclusivity deal with Nintendo because they probably want to keep

3895
03:03:27,880 --> 03:03:33,400
that. Maybe, maybe there's a WiiWare thing coming up. And I do notice, by the way, speaking

3896
03:03:33,400 --> 03:03:38,280
of WiiWare, I guess Dark Tetsuya is all excited. I think La Mulana's released is must be tomorrow

3897
03:03:38,280 --> 03:03:41,920
because I can't think of what else Dark Tetsuya would be excited over, but I know he's in

3898
03:03:41,920 --> 03:03:45,560
there. By the way, did you know Dark Sakura? I know you've been busy with your stuff, but

3899
03:03:45,560 --> 03:03:50,200
a Rondo of Blood finally saw the light of day on Monday. So a part of me wants to hook

3900
03:03:50,200 --> 03:03:57,080
up the Wii and get that. You should. I do. I need to, but it's, it's in a box. Rob, what?

3901
03:03:57,080 --> 03:04:00,600
You know how we were supposed to hang out last week and we didn't. I know. I can't this,

3902
03:04:00,600 --> 03:04:05,320
I'm going to Boston. I know. I'm going to Boston. When you're back. Okay. Rondo of Blood.

3903
03:04:05,320 --> 03:04:09,720
We need to do our show that we've talked about. Yes, we do. We can start with Rondo of Blood.

3904
03:04:09,720 --> 03:04:15,640
It would be fun. Anyway, hi. Heck yeah. Sorry, listener. Well, well Dark Sakura and I have

3905
03:04:15,640 --> 03:04:20,200
an argument. Jiditz, I guess I'll ask you, is there, is there anything else in your mind

3906
03:04:20,200 --> 03:04:25,440
tonight? I just, you said last time that you wanted to know like the phrases in different

3907
03:04:25,440 --> 03:04:32,640
languages when people come in. Yes. So I thought I'd just saying like hi is just hey or hello.

3908
03:04:32,640 --> 03:04:41,920
Oh, that's easy. Hello. Hello. Yeah. Hello. Yeah. Hello. Okay. I can do that. And goodbye

3909
03:04:41,920 --> 03:04:50,160
is like hey door. Hey door. Yeah. Hey door. Hey door. Excellent. Can you go out to the

3910
03:04:50,160 --> 03:04:56,240
barn and close the hey door? All right. I'll try. All right. No, I really appreciate that.

3911
03:04:56,240 --> 03:05:00,800
And now I need AKA Ripper to call in next, which by the way, too bad we already did our

3912
03:05:00,800 --> 03:05:04,560
game show tonight because you and AKA Ripper are both listening tonight. We could have

3913
03:05:04,560 --> 03:05:10,320
had a sweet off. I know you already decided to bow down and, and, and let, let AKA Ripper

3914
03:05:10,320 --> 03:05:15,200
have the title, but dammit, I wanted my sweet off, but I guess, I guess it is to be for

3915
03:05:15,200 --> 03:05:18,960
another day because we are running way too long tonight. We're almost like, I think we're

3916
03:05:18,960 --> 03:05:22,320
like to three and a half hours at this point. So I almost have to go to school soon. Yeah.

3917
03:05:22,320 --> 03:05:26,560
We got to go and wrap this up. Well, you, uh, better get to school young man. And, uh,

3918
03:05:26,560 --> 03:05:29,840
we'll talk to you later. Okay. Yep. Have a good one, buddy.

3919
03:05:30,560 --> 03:05:34,880
So do you buy later? All right. Thank you guys so much for our calls again. I really,

3920
03:05:34,880 --> 03:05:38,640
our phones were like lit up tonight. Like if I, if we took every single call,

3921
03:05:38,640 --> 03:05:45,040
we would be here until G did like was getting home from school. So, uh, but we need to, uh,

3922
03:05:45,040 --> 03:05:51,760
uh, turn off the phones for tonight again. Uh, please email, please Twitter, please Facebook

3923
03:05:51,760 --> 03:05:56,800
and all the other ways that we let you guys have a voice chat room, all of that fun stuff.

3924
03:05:57,920 --> 03:06:01,600
All right. Ooh. Now's the part of the show where we wrap it all up. I think we got all

3925
03:06:01,600 --> 03:06:05,200
of Loki's last minute stories, dark soccer. I don't know if you had any mesmerized by

3926
03:06:05,200 --> 03:06:09,440
reading about the healthcare passing. Yeah. It's on a lot of people's minds

3927
03:06:09,440 --> 03:06:13,520
today. I don't want to get too political, but, um, it's definitely a historical day.

3928
03:06:13,520 --> 03:06:16,240
It's a day that will be remembered. I was just looking to find out what

3929
03:06:16,240 --> 03:06:19,760
the specifics were because keep in mind, all I've been hearing is all the crap from my

3930
03:06:19,760 --> 03:06:25,200
Republican slash libertarian family. And while I have a good deal in common with

3931
03:06:26,160 --> 03:06:29,440
the libertarian platform, there are certain things that I think need to be done.

3932
03:06:29,440 --> 03:06:34,400
I'm not going to go into it, but I've been trying to see what exactly made it. So,

3933
03:06:34,400 --> 03:06:37,600
So what exactly is this again? Is this that national healthcare thing? Do I have to pay

3934
03:06:37,600 --> 03:06:40,960
more taxes for people that don't have jobs so they can get their fucking healthcare?

3935
03:06:40,960 --> 03:06:44,000
Cause that's what it seems like it's like anyways already.

3936
03:06:45,120 --> 03:06:50,800
Um, I think they are going to tax the really high, high, high plans like the Cadillac plan.

3937
03:06:50,800 --> 03:06:54,720
So that was what I was just reading. If you have a really nice plan, you might,

3938
03:06:54,720 --> 03:06:57,360
but if your plan has like any deductibles or anything like that,

3939
03:06:57,360 --> 03:07:01,120
it's probably not one of those plans. Well, the biggest thing on here is that, um,

3940
03:07:02,640 --> 03:07:07,920
instead of treating symptoms with Existrix, basically the car dealer type of deal where

3941
03:07:07,920 --> 03:07:12,800
you get more money for the options that go with it, then the focus will be on curing the problem

3942
03:07:12,800 --> 03:07:17,040
and not the symptoms of the problem, not treating the symptoms, not getting a kickback for selling

3943
03:07:17,040 --> 03:07:22,160
prescriptions, basically. I will say this much. I don't want to get too much into what I do for

3944
03:07:22,160 --> 03:07:28,480
a living and to earn my paychecks, but I do work for a big healthcare, um, uh, company here in

3945
03:07:28,480 --> 03:07:33,280
California. And I'll just say, I'm really interested for work tomorrow. It's going to be a heck of a day

3946
03:07:33,280 --> 03:07:40,000
tomorrow. So I'm just, I'm very curious to see what's going to happen. But, um, you know, change

3947
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:45,760
is always inevitable. And I think this is one of those things that, um, what was going to happen.

3948
03:07:45,760 --> 03:07:50,320
So we'll, we'll see what happens. My only, I will just say this. My only concern about the whole

3949
03:07:50,320 --> 03:07:55,440
thing is that I think that all of the other government programs need major revamping. So,

3950
03:07:55,440 --> 03:08:00,560
because I think that, yeah, you can change one thing, but you really have to look at what the

3951
03:08:00,560 --> 03:08:05,040
absolute root of the problem is. And I think that that's with the government itself. I don't know

3952
03:08:05,040 --> 03:08:09,440
necessarily that I trust them with my money. I just hope we get a new trauma center game out of

3953
03:08:09,440 --> 03:08:15,120
all this. That's what I really want. Trauma center healthcare bill. They could make a game out of

3954
03:08:15,120 --> 03:08:21,040
trying to pass a trauma center senate. Have you seen the South Park that was, uh, earlier this

3955
03:08:21,040 --> 03:08:26,560
week where they were mocking the whole Tiger Woods 11 and it was, you know, like heavy rain almost

3956
03:08:26,560 --> 03:08:31,600
where he's fighting off his wife or his girlfriend or whatever. No, I hadn't heard. It's about heavy

3957
03:08:31,600 --> 03:08:35,840
rain. No, it was, it was like, you know, they're, they're playing the game or whatever and he's

3958
03:08:35,840 --> 03:08:40,880
doing the apology and all of a sudden, you know, she comes up on stage and starts like beating

3959
03:08:40,880 --> 03:08:47,360
them up with the, uh, with the golf club and cheeses, the prenup, uh, power up and stuff

3960
03:08:47,360 --> 03:08:53,200
like that. It's pretty funny. I love SSJ was 100 Matt's comment and I'm even going to make it my

3961
03:08:53,200 --> 03:08:57,040
final thought tonight. So we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought tonight. Uh,

3962
03:08:57,040 --> 03:09:00,480
and I'm going to leave it with what SSJ 100 Matt said. Cause I think it's great

3963
03:09:00,480 --> 03:09:06,080
change. It's always good because you can take it all to coin star. Low key your final thought

3964
03:09:06,080 --> 03:09:12,640
tonight. I need me some money. Alan, thank you for being here on the show tonight. I hope you

3965
03:09:12,640 --> 03:09:15,680

3966
03:09:15,680 --> 03:09:20,160
you. Is there any final thought you have tonight? I want tacos. We'll get tacos. We'll get your

3967
03:09:20,160 --> 03:09:25,040

3970
03:09:38,480 --> 03:09:45,600
your final thoughts tonight. Horseradish is still burning. Thank you guys so much for

3971
03:09:45,600 --> 03:09:50,000
listening to our show and supporting independent radio. We really, really appreciate your support.

3972
03:09:50,000 --> 03:09:53,360
We appreciate the five star reviews you guys leave on iTunes and we really appreciate when

3973
03:09:53,360 --> 03:09:57,920

3974
03:09:57,920 --> 03:10:02,480
and you got two weeks to do it. Unfortunately, there will be no show next week, but stay tuned

3975
03:10:02,480 --> 03:10:08,640
to our social networking sites for a special bonus special Rob on the road at penny arcade East.

3976
03:10:08,640 --> 03:10:14,240
And if you're one of our listeners find me at PAX East because I will be interviewing folks. My,

3977
03:10:14,240 --> 03:10:19,920
my goal is to have this show be like an Epic four hour show. Just me talking to listeners,

3978
03:10:19,920 --> 03:10:26,160
me talking to developers, me talking to you at PAX East. So remember what word has been repeated

3979
03:10:26,160 --> 03:10:34,480
the most? Me, me, me, me, me, me, the me show. Yay. No, it's the Rob show. It's starring him.

3980
03:10:35,120 --> 03:10:40,080
No, it's the gamers having a voice show and I'm just the person that helps them get their voices

3981
03:10:40,080 --> 03:10:47,360
out. It's the Rob show. Hey, look, you could come to packs too. If I could sneak you in my suitcase.

3982
03:10:48,800 --> 03:10:53,360
I'm so freaking broke, but you'll have to, uh, you'll have to say for packs prime in August

3983
03:10:53,360 --> 03:10:57,360
labor day weekend, right? Cause I'm trying to get Alan to go to packs prime. Alan wants to go to

3984
03:10:57,360 --> 03:11:02,400
packs prime. Yes. I want someone to pay for me to go cause I'm broke. And E3 I got E3 on the

3985
03:11:02,400 --> 03:11:08,640
horizon too. I can't, I can't afford to go to Disneyland. Oh no. Unless I have a full paid way

3986
03:11:08,640 --> 03:11:14,320
there. That's going to be rough. That's Disneyland ain't cheap. I know. All right. You guys are

3987
03:11:14,320 --> 03:11:19,040
invited to my birthday party that we can do. You have, you know what you do have your birthday

3988
03:11:19,040 --> 03:11:24,640
party with Disney decorations. My birthday. If you want, we'll get a little teacup. I'll spin

3989
03:11:24,640 --> 03:11:30,000
you around. My birthday party is going to be a beer pot luck. Everybody brings different types

3990
03:11:30,000 --> 03:11:34,560
of beer as long as it's good. It's a great idea. All right. That's it. We're out of here. It's

3991
03:11:34,560 --> 03:11:39,200
been an Epic show tonight. Thank you all for being a part of it and making it happen. You have
