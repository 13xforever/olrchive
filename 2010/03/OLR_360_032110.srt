1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,361
[SPEAKER_11]: Sky, and Loki.

2
00:00:14,121 --> 00:00:24,565
[SPEAKER_11]: Tonight, March 21st, 2010, the Xbox 360 is set to get USB storage, GameStop tests perks for loyal customers, and what PlayStation 3 add-on is selling.

3
00:00:31,286 --> 00:00:37,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, my friends, and welcome to episode number 360 of Orange Lounge Radio.

[SPEAKER_03]: I'm having trouble speaking tonight.

5
00:00:39,271 --> 00:00:40,552
[SPEAKER_03]: This bodes well for tonight's show.

6
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,714
[SPEAKER_03]: The video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,864
[SPEAKER_03]: She's at another commitment right now, but she'll be here about 7, 7.30-ish Pacific time, depending on when that is all over.

9
00:00:59,244 --> 00:01:04,449
[SPEAKER_03]: But never fear, I am joined by the one and only Techmaster Loki Hello How are you doing tonight, Loki?

10
00:01:04,669 --> 00:01:20,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing fine Good, at least he has chicken Once again, I noticed he stopped by KFC tonight Yeah, I don't know, it sounded good again Alright, that's fine Also joining us tonight, we have a special guest He was here a couple weeks ago and he decided to come on back It is Salacious Pop, or Alan Hello How are you?

11
00:01:21,005 --> 00:01:22,026
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm good Yeah?

[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I'm going to try and talk a little bit more

13
00:01:24,948 --> 00:01:25,929
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to try and talk more today.

14
00:01:25,949 --> 00:01:28,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Good, because you have to fill in for DarkSakura because she's out.

15
00:01:28,571 --> 00:01:31,012
[SPEAKER_03]: But remember, those mics, not very sensitive, so keep it.

16
00:01:31,112 --> 00:01:33,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a little stage fright last time I was on.

17
00:01:33,474 --> 00:01:33,894
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.

18
00:01:34,314 --> 00:01:35,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight you're going to be extra sassy.

19
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I hope so.

20
00:01:36,216 --> 00:01:38,477
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be our sassy gay friend on the show tonight.

21
00:01:39,218 --> 00:01:40,378
[SPEAKER_03]: A stupid bitch.

22
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:41,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you seen those YouTubes?

23
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:41,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

24
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,080
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't find them funny.

25
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,761
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a fan.

26
00:01:43,821 --> 00:01:44,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

27
00:01:44,781 --> 00:01:45,222
[SPEAKER_03]: They're funny.

28
00:01:45,342 --> 00:01:45,682
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

29
00:01:45,982 --> 00:01:48,283
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not a fan of the sassy gay friend?

30
00:01:48,403 --> 00:01:49,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Not their fan on Facebook?

31
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:49,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

32
00:01:50,204 --> 00:01:50,804
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're funny.

33
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:51,505
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, forget it.

34
00:01:53,325 --> 00:02:00,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, we tape live every week, of course, at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

35
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:00,969
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 6 p.m.

36
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:03,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

37
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:13,815
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're listening to us live, pull up a chair and join us in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, where we have the first comment tonight from Blackwolf, of course, our good pal who does the show before us here at All Games.

38
00:02:14,295 --> 00:02:16,797
[SPEAKER_03]: saying in our chatroom, Sky broke into DarkSakura's house.

39
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:19,218
[SPEAKER_03]: And X-Link follows that up with Loki picked the lock.

40
00:02:19,338 --> 00:02:21,080
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Dan is here, folks.

41
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan the man let us in.

42
00:02:22,881 --> 00:02:24,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't come until way later.

43
00:02:24,222 --> 00:02:28,104
[SPEAKER_03]: He's in the gaming vault right now, and I don't know what he's playing.

44
00:02:28,164 --> 00:02:30,146
[SPEAKER_02]: He was playing Otomedia's gorgeous...

45
00:02:31,846 --> 00:02:43,950
[SPEAKER_03]: I sold my Japanese 360 Oh, very cool, okay Yeah, I wondered why you brought a 360 to the show tonight And I thought it might be because this is episode number 360 And I was like, oh, are we going to take one apart live on air?

46
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:55,714
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, well, that's going to be shitty radio You could do that It's not very exciting Yeah, especially when it's a radio show It's more exciting to hear you bitch about the guy that stole your 360 How's that going, by the way?

47
00:02:55,734 --> 00:02:56,794
[SPEAKER_03]: The cops ever do anything about that?

48
00:02:57,934 --> 00:02:59,935
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not yet Sorry to hear it Bastards

49
00:03:00,635 --> 00:03:09,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well we always start off the show with a little bit of how was your gaming week, so tonight we'll start with Loki, usually ladies first, but since there are no ladies, Loki will have to be our lady tonight.

50
00:03:09,621 --> 00:03:11,862
[SPEAKER_02]: I will not be your lady tonight.

51
00:03:13,676 --> 00:03:14,076
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

52
00:03:14,377 --> 00:03:15,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

53
00:03:16,058 --> 00:03:23,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Very uneventful, actually, because I don't know what I was playing this week, but not a lot of new things, I guess.

54
00:03:24,323 --> 00:03:25,624
[SPEAKER_02]: More Grand Theft Auto, as usual.

55
00:03:26,265 --> 00:03:39,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Still not enough Grand Theft Auto, I think, because I find myself kind of in a flux as far as going up the leaderboards, just because other people are playing it more than I am, so I go up a lot, and then I come back down.

56
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:42,796
[SPEAKER_02]: And I go up a lot, and come back down, because other people are playing it and getting ahead of me.

57
00:03:43,636 --> 00:03:44,397
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

58
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:24,685
[SPEAKER_02]: This week though, I am looking forward to being able to hopefully play against some of the Rockstar employees because I know they're going to be doing their event on Tuesday during, I think it goes from 1 to 4 Eastern, I'm not positive, but I think that's the time frame.

59
00:04:25,385 --> 00:04:26,506
[SPEAKER_02]: 4-7 Eastern Final Fantasy XIII

60
00:04:47,256 --> 00:04:51,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Weren't those character names from Final Fantasy 2 or something like that?

61
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:56,342
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Palam and Poram, but the way they spell it in XIII is a little different.

62
00:04:56,382 --> 00:05:00,185
[SPEAKER_03]: But I kind of am convinced it is a nod a little bit to Final Fantasy 4.

63
00:05:00,225 --> 00:05:03,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I was like, hey, that's a name from something else.

64
00:05:04,048 --> 00:05:06,270
[SPEAKER_02]: And what is up with Cid being bad?

65
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,492
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, first off, Cid doesn't look like Cid.

66
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:11,213
[SPEAKER_03]: OMG, spoilers!

67
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:13,535
[SPEAKER_03]: There's supposed to be a six-month moratorium on spoilers, remember?

68
00:05:13,555 --> 00:05:13,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

69
00:05:13,775 --> 00:05:18,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, everybody knows that Sid doesn't look like Sid because they had pictures out there already.

70
00:05:18,897 --> 00:05:19,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine.

71
00:05:19,077 --> 00:05:19,757
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured that out.

72
00:05:19,837 --> 00:05:20,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine.

73
00:05:20,578 --> 00:05:22,958
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, he may be evil, he may not be evil.

74
00:05:22,998 --> 00:05:25,819
[SPEAKER_02]: He still has an airship thing, some sort of ship.

75
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,701
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like emo Sid.

76
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:31,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't Sid bad in 12?

77
00:05:32,642 --> 00:05:33,442
[SPEAKER_03]: I never played 12.

78
00:05:33,562 --> 00:05:34,443
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember.

79
00:05:34,763 --> 00:05:39,024
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say I read, I didn't get far enough, honestly, but I want to say I read somewhere that he was bad in 12.

80
00:05:41,045 --> 00:05:43,207
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know Cid never looks like Cid, but come on, man.

81
00:05:43,247 --> 00:05:46,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's a stretch right now.

82
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

83
00:05:48,451 --> 00:05:50,652
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, what else?

84
00:05:51,373 --> 00:05:54,375
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it's kind of moving along.

85
00:05:54,495 --> 00:06:03,082
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I'm to the point now where I'm just running past a lot of the battles because I just don't want to fight them anymore and just keep going.

86
00:06:03,772 --> 00:06:04,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

87
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:24,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.

88
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:24,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheatless.

89
00:06:24,809 --> 00:06:28,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you're going to be like, oh, my arcade cabinet, or oh, Grand Theft Auto 4.

90
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:29,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of cheating, though, that reminds me.

91
00:06:29,272 --> 00:06:38,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I played more Borderlands this week and finally loaded up the new expansion a little bit just because I'm trying to raise my level cap again.

92
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:46,902
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we played a little bit of the zombie island of Dr. Ned, and that was kind of fun.

93
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:50,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Robot Unicorn Attack

94
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:14,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that inspired by OLR?

95
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, kind of, yeah.

96
00:07:16,981 --> 00:07:23,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of WoW, World of Warcraft, and oddly enough, a lot of Bejeweled and Peggle within World of Warcraft.

97
00:07:23,406 --> 00:07:24,667
[SPEAKER_04]: So, kind of meta.

98
00:07:25,307 --> 00:07:28,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Some Warcraft 3, actually, going back to 2002.

99
00:07:29,411 --> 00:07:30,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Kicking it old school in Warcraft 3.

100
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:35,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Blizzard just updated a patch for Warcraft 3 to fix some exploits.

101
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Why now?

102
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,961
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so far out.

103
00:07:39,941 --> 00:07:40,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Why bother?

104
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:42,221
[SPEAKER_04]: They're awesome and they support their games forever.

105
00:07:42,401 --> 00:07:44,202
[SPEAKER_03]: How long have the exploits been available?

106
00:07:44,642 --> 00:07:47,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Were the exploits just found a couple months ago or something?

107
00:07:47,703 --> 00:07:51,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're just from the previous patch from a year ago.

108
00:07:51,924 --> 00:07:53,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess they're really obscure.

109
00:07:54,284 --> 00:07:59,765
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so much lore in World of Warcraft that I just launched three to play a few missions from that for nostalgia.

110
00:08:00,645 --> 00:08:01,186
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's about it.

111
00:08:01,886 --> 00:08:02,846
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it for your gaming week.

112
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:08,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Liquid Parrot says, I remember taking down Sky's high score and bejeweled on Facebook by cheating.

113
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:09,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Needless to say, it was frowned upon.

114
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:10,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, because cheating cheaters...

115
00:08:22,634 --> 00:08:25,455
[SPEAKER_03]: are rude, especially in multiplayer environments.

116
00:08:25,535 --> 00:08:29,437
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really care that Loki cheats on Final Fantasy XIII.

117
00:08:29,477 --> 00:08:31,838
[SPEAKER_03]: If he wants to ruin the game for himself by doing that, fine.

118
00:08:32,138 --> 00:08:32,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Have fun.

119
00:08:32,818 --> 00:08:34,619
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

120
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:38,581
[SPEAKER_02]: I've turned it into a more casual game because now I don't have to waste my time.

121
00:08:39,481 --> 00:08:42,882
[SPEAKER_03]: You have managed to make it be nothing but cutscenes in Final Fantasy XIII.

122
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:45,804
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all it is anyway.

123
00:08:46,124 --> 00:08:49,885
[SPEAKER_03]: You managed to take what little game there actually was out of Final Fantasy XIII.

124
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,646
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, Odin battle, ha!

125
00:08:52,699 --> 00:09:02,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, the Odin battles or the battles against the summons are actually difficult still because you have to do combo damage to them, not necessarily damage damage to them.

126
00:09:03,024 --> 00:09:05,405
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's still as difficult as it would normally be.

127
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything else, so right through it.

128
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:09,746
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, oh no, this monster's going to be really hard.

129
00:09:10,247 --> 00:09:10,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Tap.

130
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's done.

131
00:09:12,047 --> 00:09:12,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God.

132
00:09:12,608 --> 00:09:14,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to have to sit here for 15 minutes.

133
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:15,489
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

134
00:09:16,145 --> 00:09:17,266
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll see you next time.

135
00:09:34,114 --> 00:09:37,797
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't, oddly enough, I didn't play Final Fantasy XIII at all this week.

136
00:09:37,857 --> 00:09:43,062
[SPEAKER_03]: I've just been distracted with, I don't know how many of you heard the call on Bobby's show tonight, but I have a lot going on in my personal life.

137
00:09:43,102 --> 00:09:47,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'm going to be changing my day job in the next couple weeks, which is big, and then, you know, I just moved recently.

138
00:09:48,286 --> 00:09:53,950
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and then, you know, Boston's coming up too, which honestly I haven't given as much thought to, but that is definitely on my mind.

139
00:09:54,471 --> 00:10:00,436
[SPEAKER_03]: So I haven't had as much gaming time until the weekend when Alan and I just played a crap load of stuff this weekend.

140
00:10:00,876 --> 00:10:03,119
[SPEAKER_03]: So sadly I haven't really been in Final Fantasy XIII.

141
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,683
[SPEAKER_03]: And some folks in chat kind of arguing about the Odin battle.

142
00:10:06,183 --> 00:10:11,731
[SPEAKER_03]: I lost the first time and then once I did the Libra and Alan can vouch for this because he was there.

143
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:17,058
[SPEAKER_03]: I did the Libra and read that he was weak to chain attacks and I was like, oh, just use a Ravage Ravage in your party.

144
00:10:17,298 --> 00:10:17,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Easy.

145
00:10:18,099 --> 00:10:20,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're all weak to chain attacks.

146
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:38,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind when you're trying to fill a stagger bar.

147
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:41,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Ravagers increase that bar quickly.

148
00:10:41,423 --> 00:10:43,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Commandos maintain it.

149
00:10:43,424 --> 00:10:52,650
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you are trying to get, especially if you're in the part where you're fighting with the metal armadillos or whatever that takes forever to kill, remember that you can use a team of all ravagers.

150
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:57,874
[SPEAKER_03]: You just need to paradigm shift over and get a commando in there once in a while to make sure the bar doesn't drop too fast.

151
00:10:58,134 --> 00:10:58,835
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

152
00:11:17,069 --> 00:11:43,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, I don't want to get too much into Final Fantasy XIII spoilers Because I know there's people that haven't even touched it yet But I'm trying very hard not to give story spoilers There's still that one little revelation I picked up on last week That I'm like, I really want to find out if that's for real What I'm thinking, or if I'm just making shit up in my head There's another little twist that you figure out later on I like how the way they kind of addressed it Because you're like, wait a second What's that person doing in that cutscene?

153
00:11:43,719 --> 00:11:44,519
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that type of thing

154
00:11:47,144 --> 00:11:51,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Ionotropic in chat wants to know, how do you read the info after using Libra?

155
00:11:51,825 --> 00:11:52,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Hit the R1 button.

156
00:11:53,405 --> 00:11:54,966
[SPEAKER_03]: That's on PS3, I imagine.

157
00:11:55,226 --> 00:11:56,486
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the right shoulder button.

158
00:11:56,646 --> 00:11:58,246
[SPEAKER_03]: 360, it's the trigger of the shoulder, yeah.

159
00:11:58,266 --> 00:11:58,927
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the shoulder button.

160
00:11:59,347 --> 00:12:02,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, other stuff I've actually been playing this week.

161
00:12:03,047 --> 00:12:05,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Quite a bit, thanks to The Weeknd and Alan being here.

162
00:12:05,848 --> 00:12:08,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, the one I know people in chat want me to talk about.

163
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:15,570
[SPEAKER_03]: We had just a spur-of-the-moment, impromptu battle with Under Sedation Live last night in Perfect Dark.

164
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:24,076
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Saturday night show on All Games, Under Station Live, Travis and Breslow, it was their off week because they're bi-weekly right now, or what is it?

165
00:12:24,156 --> 00:12:29,320
[SPEAKER_03]: No, bi-monthly is when you're every other week because they have Sakura Con on the horizon and John's really busy.

166
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,541
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're only every other week right now.

167
00:12:31,602 --> 00:12:32,542
[SPEAKER_03]: So this was their off week.

168
00:12:32,702 --> 00:12:35,384
[SPEAKER_03]: So they were on Perfect Dark last night really late.

169
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:39,387
[SPEAKER_03]: And I kept getting all these messages like, we signed on to play something else.

170
00:12:39,527 --> 00:12:40,928
[SPEAKER_03]: What were we playing last night on 360?

171
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:41,769
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

172
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:42,970
[SPEAKER_03]: We started to play something else.

173
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Rock Band, I think.

174
00:12:44,591 --> 00:12:45,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Gagapack, Rockband

175
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Duke Nukem.

176
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:23,924
[SPEAKER_03]: I just never got around to playing Goldeneye because I didn't get a 64 until really late in the game and by that point I just kind of bought it from Mario Party and Pokemon Snap.

177
00:13:23,944 --> 00:13:24,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't judge me!

178
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,706
[SPEAKER_03]: So somehow I never played Perfect Dart.

179
00:13:28,926 --> 00:13:29,226
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

180
00:13:30,426 --> 00:13:32,146
[SPEAKER_03]: But they were like, you gotta get it, you gotta get it.

181
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:39,148
[SPEAKER_03]: And I played the demo earlier in the day before Alan showed up, and I was kind of like, okay, well, I don't know, I don't really get this.

182
00:13:39,288 --> 00:13:47,230
[SPEAKER_03]: I see how it's Nintendo 64, and it definitely looks like they put a lot of work into the overhaul of this, but I don't know, I just, I don't really get this, whatever.

183
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:52,851
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm like, it wasn't bad, it was just, you know, I think this would mean more if it held in my memories.

184
00:13:53,491 --> 00:13:53,691
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

185
00:13:55,576 --> 00:13:57,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally, he berates me with a message.

186
00:13:57,557 --> 00:14:00,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Travis sends me a text message going, you pussy, play Perfect Dark with us.

187
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:02,298
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Misty's getting in on it.

188
00:14:02,838 --> 00:14:04,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Just everybody's just berating me.

189
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:05,419
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm like, fine!

190
00:14:05,939 --> 00:14:08,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I will fucking come play Perfect Dark with you and shoot you all in the face.

191
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:19,843
[SPEAKER_03]: So, luckily enough, the Perfect Dark multiplayer is cool enough where both Alan and I could sign into our respective Xbox accounts on the same console and play the split screen, and we were in a match.

192
00:14:20,223 --> 00:14:30,595
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the match was Travis, John, Misty, myself, Alan, that Nick guy who I haven't talked to, but he was there.

193
00:14:30,955 --> 00:14:32,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt joined us for later matches.

194
00:14:32,878 --> 00:14:33,338
[SPEAKER_03]: And was that it?

195
00:14:33,638 --> 00:14:34,359
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like seven of us.

196
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,020
[SPEAKER_03]: And

197
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:44,963
[SPEAKER_03]: And so after Matt joins, he hooks up his soundboard and he's playing all these Duke Nukem sounds through my speaker like, oh yeah, and all these things.

198
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,283
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just like, god damn it.

199
00:14:46,763 --> 00:14:50,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's laughing so hard, partially because I think most of them were drunk.

200
00:14:50,284 --> 00:14:51,525
[SPEAKER_03]: I think John and Nick were drunk.

201
00:14:51,665 --> 00:14:51,985
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

202
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,126
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

203
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:08,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you jump in Doom?

204
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,600
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

205
00:15:09,761 --> 00:15:10,881
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you couldn't jump in Doom.

206
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:12,121
[SPEAKER_03]: So, okay.

207
00:15:12,181 --> 00:15:13,482
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just like, okay, I have to approach Doom.

208
00:15:13,502 --> 00:15:18,003
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can, and I figured out you can walk in the ladders and go up ladders that way.

209
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:19,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I figured that out after a few minutes.

210
00:15:20,484 --> 00:15:24,045
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was cool because I got to, like, punch Jon in the face a couple times.

211
00:15:24,145 --> 00:15:25,065
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was fun.

212
00:15:25,385 --> 00:15:25,785
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fun.

213
00:15:25,805 --> 00:15:33,008
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was this weird, like, clipping thing that happened where somehow I ended up below Alan, whose character was on top of me.

214
00:15:33,088 --> 00:15:35,488
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was punching him in the vagina repeatedly.

215
00:15:35,528 --> 00:15:35,989
[SPEAKER_03]: In his skirt, yeah.

216
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:36,649
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I had no gun.

217
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:37,149
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a skirt on.

218
00:15:37,429 --> 00:15:39,750
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like I was just punching him in the skirt region.

219
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,470
[SPEAKER_03]: And did I kill you?

220
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:40,810
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

221
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,731
[SPEAKER_03]: I think finally you thought to look down and shoot me in the head.

222
00:15:43,831 --> 00:15:44,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

223
00:15:44,191 --> 00:15:44,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

224
00:15:44,771 --> 00:15:45,211
[SPEAKER_03]: And I died.

225
00:15:45,271 --> 00:15:45,691
[SPEAKER_03]: It was sad.

226
00:15:47,311 --> 00:15:48,232
[SPEAKER_03]: But Perfect Dark was fun.

227
00:15:48,272 --> 00:15:49,892
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a blast playing that last night, actually.

228
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:50,852
[SPEAKER_03]: It was $10 well spent.

229
00:15:50,872 --> 00:15:52,893
[SPEAKER_03]: So I understand why people are all excited.

230
00:15:52,913 --> 00:15:55,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's a good multiplayer game.

231
00:15:55,693 --> 00:15:56,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody was having fun.

232
00:15:56,554 --> 00:15:59,794
[SPEAKER_03]: I felt bad for Alan because I only have the one wireless headset.

233
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:00,595
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had that on.

234
00:16:00,955 --> 00:16:02,775
[SPEAKER_03]: And even though I had the mode on where you can –

235
00:16:06,756 --> 00:16:08,097
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't hear shit through the speakers.

236
00:16:08,477 --> 00:16:08,857
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't.

237
00:16:08,937 --> 00:16:11,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I think, Alan, could you hear anything at all coming through the speakers?

238
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:16,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, them talking through the TV speakers along with the game effects?

239
00:16:16,401 --> 00:16:16,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.

240
00:16:17,342 --> 00:16:19,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you can kind of tell people are talking, but I had no idea what was going on.

241
00:16:20,703 --> 00:16:24,324
[SPEAKER_03]: And Matt's in chat right now going, although Rob used his boyfriend as a decoy several times.

242
00:16:24,624 --> 00:16:28,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what we thought to do later on is we were like, is that you?

243
00:16:28,265 --> 00:16:28,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, is that you?

244
00:16:28,825 --> 00:16:30,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's walk around together and try to find John.

245
00:16:32,746 --> 00:16:33,746
[SPEAKER_03]: And assault him that way.

246
00:16:33,786 --> 00:16:35,046
[SPEAKER_03]: But that didn't work out very well.

247
00:16:35,146 --> 00:16:39,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was running around unarmed just so that people could shoot me.

248
00:16:40,047 --> 00:16:43,408
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wasn't really playing for real, which is really sort of shitty of me.

249
00:16:43,508 --> 00:16:45,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sure, sure.

250
00:16:45,669 --> 00:16:47,309
[SPEAKER_04]: I had zero kills the last two matches.

251
00:16:47,369 --> 00:16:49,416
[SPEAKER_03]: You were letting us win, Alan, of course.

252
00:16:49,436 --> 00:16:50,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just running around being stupid.

253
00:16:52,985 --> 00:16:55,407
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like first person shooters on consoles

254
00:17:18,273 --> 00:17:20,537
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you, such and such player!

255
00:17:20,557 --> 00:17:21,619
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, damn you.

256
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, where were you?

257
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,011
[SPEAKER_03]: You hate first-person shooters on consoles.

258
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:34,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I can do it, but I'm more of a stickler for the mouse and keyboard.

259
00:17:35,152 --> 00:17:37,272
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was being stubborn.

260
00:17:37,332 --> 00:17:40,053
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, because you're like a Half-Life geek.

261
00:17:40,513 --> 00:17:42,313
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something I have to remember.

262
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:43,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Half-Life is like God to you, right?

263
00:17:43,973 --> 00:17:44,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

264
00:17:44,353 --> 00:17:46,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so all this other stuff is crap.

265
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:52,675
[SPEAKER_03]: But have you ever played the Orange Box on 360, or is that like sacrilege to you?

266
00:17:53,475 --> 00:18:01,659
[SPEAKER_04]: I downloaded the demo for it, which is the beginning of Half-Life Episode 2 on the 360, just to, you know, played it for about a half hour, decided I didn't like the controls.

267
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so you're one of those PC elitists.

268
00:18:04,181 --> 00:18:04,541
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

269
00:18:04,581 --> 00:18:05,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a little bit.

270
00:18:05,141 --> 00:18:05,441
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

271
00:18:05,942 --> 00:18:06,922
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so other gaming weeks.

272
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:09,043
[SPEAKER_03]: So then we played Rock Band.

273
00:18:09,063 --> 00:18:11,084
[SPEAKER_03]: We finally got around to playing the Gaga songs in Rock Band.

274
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:15,847
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll say this because I said it to Bobby on his show because he was talking about how he bought the Eric Cartman poker face.

275
00:18:16,187 --> 00:18:19,989
[SPEAKER_03]: That poker face Cartman thing is the kind of thing that's, like, funny once.

276
00:18:20,829 --> 00:18:24,812
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't see myself playing that song over and over again because I liked the song.

277
00:18:24,852 --> 00:18:25,672
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny once.

278
00:18:26,233 --> 00:18:38,100
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you have a lot of people that come to your house to play rock band, you throw the rock band parties, somebody inevitably is going to pull that song up at a party and go, I want to sing the Cartman Poker Face.

279
00:18:39,681 --> 00:18:42,103
[SPEAKER_03]: We played it once and we were like, ha ha, next.

280
00:18:42,564 --> 00:18:46,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can at least do a South Park medley at least now because you've got a couple songs.

281
00:18:46,587 --> 00:18:47,488
[SPEAKER_03]: And Timmy, right?

282
00:18:48,108 --> 00:18:50,570
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we squealed because we were able to play Bad Romance.

283
00:18:51,892 --> 00:18:52,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

284
00:18:53,813 --> 00:18:54,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Then what else?

285
00:18:54,394 --> 00:18:54,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Today.

286
00:18:54,854 --> 00:18:55,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so today...

287
00:18:57,048 --> 00:18:57,909
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

288
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:49,487
[SPEAKER_03]: so we put in Beautiful Katamari and I'm like okay let's do co-op mode and I was kind of surprised oh it's not split screen oh we're controlling the same Katamari so Alan and I are trying to play and we just keep rolling the Katamari in a giant circle like and there's nothing on the screen to tell you like so and so is tilting the wrong way it's just it was bad like there was nothing to do it just splits the twin stick controls between the two people

289
00:19:50,087 --> 00:19:52,509
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's, yeah, I wasn't feeling it at all.

290
00:19:52,689 --> 00:19:53,369
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was terrible.

291
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:55,910
[SPEAKER_03]: After like 30 seconds, Alan was like, turn it off, turn it off.

292
00:19:56,551 --> 00:20:01,093
[SPEAKER_03]: So he decided to do Versus because it's like, okay, I've seen a picture of a split screen on the back of the box.

293
00:20:01,554 --> 00:20:05,936
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this has to have like a two-player true mode in it.

294
00:20:06,236 --> 00:20:07,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure enough, Versus...

295
00:20:07,697 --> 00:20:08,417
[SPEAKER_03]: is split screen.

296
00:20:08,658 --> 00:20:10,819
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we were going to the stage select, we're like, oh, home.

297
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:11,839
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, okay, cool.

298
00:20:11,859 --> 00:20:13,720
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be like, who can make the biggest Katamari?

299
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,421
[SPEAKER_03]: This will be fun.

300
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:15,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, now this will be great.

301
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:20,564
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the battle was roll up the most clothespins in one minute.

302
00:20:20,824 --> 00:20:21,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Go.

303
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:26,347
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like this generically square playing field with a bunch of clothespins.

304
00:20:26,908 --> 00:20:28,509
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was roll up as many as you can.

305
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:32,711
[SPEAKER_03]: And he tried to crash into the other Katamari once in a while and make them lose clothespins.

306
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:33,932
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we play that.

307
00:20:33,972 --> 00:20:35,953
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, this is not fun.

308
00:20:36,673 --> 00:20:37,815
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

309
00:20:47,321 --> 00:21:16,293
[SPEAKER_03]: and I was like this is shit like I think I literally said after it was over and it's not just because Alan beat me but I was like this is shit and I threw my controller down it was shit it was not fun like a versus Katamari game should be so much better I don't know if they got it right on PS3 you know I even in the single player mode the PS3 is the better game than the 360 and that has nothing to do with the consoles themselves don't start the console wars with me it's just that for what you know beautiful Katamari came first and they made mistakes so maybe they fixed them with the PS3 one I don't know but the

310
00:21:16,553 --> 00:21:44,444
[SPEAKER_03]: PS3, Katamari Forever or whatever is superior to the 361 and I haven't even played the co-op reverses so after that was terrible we decided to go into arcade and we were just kind of looking through arcade games to play and I was like okay Alan what do you want to play like what don't you have yourself and he's like oh you have Double Dragon let's play that I'm like okay like I think I played this for like five seconds when I first downloaded it back when I would just download arcade games to download them like

311
00:21:44,944 --> 00:21:46,045
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

312
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,876
[SPEAKER_04]: That game does not stand to the test of time.

313
00:22:01,976 --> 00:22:03,718
[SPEAKER_04]: That game is terrible.

314
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:05,600
[SPEAKER_04]: It's terrible.

315
00:22:06,281 --> 00:22:11,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel bad for all of the $5 bills that I extorted from my mother and grandmother.

316
00:22:11,387 --> 00:22:15,792
[SPEAKER_04]: This game's really hard at the arcade, little nine-year-old me playing a bad game.

317
00:22:17,114 --> 00:22:17,695
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awful.

318
00:22:17,995 --> 00:22:22,099
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those games I think we really see through rose-colored glasses or whatever they call it.

319
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:23,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, remember better from our childhood.

320
00:22:24,641 --> 00:22:29,965
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if it's just the 360 port or whatever, but there's freaking slowdown and flickering.

321
00:22:30,526 --> 00:22:32,387
[SPEAKER_03]: And the game is just fucking cheap.

322
00:22:32,968 --> 00:22:36,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, don't press down too much or you're going to fall off the edge.

323
00:22:36,831 --> 00:22:39,534
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like this horrible collision detection in the game.

324
00:22:40,134 --> 00:22:43,617
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally when we got to the end, we had to battle each other.

325
00:22:44,898 --> 00:22:50,922
[SPEAKER_03]: to see who got the big tittied girl and it was like the worst fight in the entire world that we did.

326
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:52,684
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally I somehow won.

327
00:22:53,044 --> 00:22:58,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though Alan hit me with a baseball bat like 50 times, all I did was I had to pull his hair a few times and I won.

328
00:22:58,328 --> 00:23:03,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm pretty sure that the three punches does way more damage than the baseball bat because I hit you about eight times.

329
00:23:04,312 --> 00:23:08,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so we played our way through Double Dragon and we were like, what the hell are we thinking as children?

330
00:23:08,635 --> 00:23:10,856
[SPEAKER_03]: This game was better, it was better on the NES, honestly.

331
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:14,078
[SPEAKER_03]: I would rather play the NES version of Double Dragon than the 360 version.

332
00:23:14,098 --> 00:23:15,859
[SPEAKER_03]: The NES version was awesome.

333
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:21,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Although now I'm worried, I'm like, I wonder if I'm just remembering that one more fondly than I deserve to.

334
00:23:21,643 --> 00:23:27,147
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's just like Contra, like Contra on the arcade, I didn't really care for it, but on the NES it was cool.

335
00:23:27,927 --> 00:23:29,048
[SPEAKER_03]: VidPower in chat says, 50,000?

336
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:32,472
[SPEAKER_03]: You scored 50,000 points on Double Dragon?

337
00:23:33,033 --> 00:23:33,894
[SPEAKER_03]: From the movie The Wizard.

338
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:39,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, if you can score like 50,000 points on Double Dragon, that actually is really impressive.

339
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I have a lot of respect for a gamer that can do that now after seeing how fucking cheap that game is.

340
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:50,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I kid you not, the last boss will shoot you in the back with a gun and you will die instantly.

341
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Insert quarter to continue.

342
00:23:53,251 --> 00:23:54,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what the hell?

343
00:23:54,512 --> 00:23:56,793
[SPEAKER_03]: No wonder they removed that game from Xbox Live Marketplace.

344
00:23:56,814 --> 00:23:57,354
[SPEAKER_03]: It was bad.

345
00:23:58,154 --> 00:24:00,476
[SPEAKER_03]: So then I said to Alan, I was like, well, fuck it.

346
00:24:00,516 --> 00:24:02,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just make it a bad game day.

347
00:24:02,717 --> 00:24:16,747
[SPEAKER_03]: and so that's when I reached for Fusion Frenzy 2 yes the game I spent $60 on when it first came out I decided to pop it in because I'm like Alan no you have to see how fucking terrible this game is so we played like what four which by the way if you've never played Fusion Frenzy 2

348
00:24:17,848 --> 00:24:22,449
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like Xbox's answer to Mario Party, but with a more science fiction future theme.

349
00:24:23,089 --> 00:24:26,830
[SPEAKER_03]: So we flew to the planet Moisture to do some battle in some water.

350
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:28,791
[SPEAKER_02]: No one should ever fly to the planet Moisture.

351
00:24:28,991 --> 00:24:31,832
[SPEAKER_03]: To do some battle in some water-themed stages.

352
00:24:32,632 --> 00:24:34,392
[SPEAKER_03]: And Alan, what were your thoughts on Fusion Frenzy 2?

353
00:24:34,952 --> 00:24:38,653
[SPEAKER_04]: It was emotional abuse, and I'm upset, and I need to call a shelter.

354
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:41,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Gamer spouse abuse.

355
00:24:44,055 --> 00:24:45,215
[SPEAKER_03]: What was so bad about it?

356
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:55,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, the host was in like his pink jumpsuit with the spiky hair and you could tell that it was sort of, you know, edgy, like designed by committee.

357
00:24:55,930 --> 00:25:01,937
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was really just sort of the showgirls of party games, but without any of the breasts or anything that makes showgirls great.

358
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:04,560
[SPEAKER_04]: It was awful.

359
00:25:05,441 --> 00:25:07,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, showgirls of party games would be awesome.

360
00:25:09,432 --> 00:25:10,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait, Dan, Dan, Dan.

361
00:25:10,372 --> 00:25:11,553
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to get Dan on mic with that.

362
00:25:11,573 --> 00:25:13,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hand Dan the mic real quick?

363
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,714
[SPEAKER_06]: My Double Dragon score is 68,920.

364
00:25:15,934 --> 00:25:18,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I shake your hand, sir?

365
00:25:18,294 --> 00:25:19,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to shake your hand.

366
00:25:19,215 --> 00:25:20,835
[SPEAKER_03]: You are a gaming stud, sir, Dan.

367
00:25:21,175 --> 00:25:21,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, Dan.

368
00:25:21,595 --> 00:25:23,916
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to say, for the record, I'm listening to you guys talking here.

369
00:25:24,616 --> 00:25:26,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Your opinions about games are all crap.

370
00:25:27,757 --> 00:25:29,117
[SPEAKER_06]: The Arcade Contra is awesome.

371
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:31,122
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Contra.

372
00:25:31,142 --> 00:25:32,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Double Dragon rules.

373
00:25:32,443 --> 00:25:32,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait, wait.

374
00:25:33,143 --> 00:25:34,864
[SPEAKER_03]: When did I say shit about Contra?

375
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:35,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.

376
00:25:35,505 --> 00:25:35,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you did.

377
00:25:36,005 --> 00:25:37,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, fuck Loki.

378
00:25:37,266 --> 00:25:37,526
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

379
00:25:38,207 --> 00:25:39,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Double Dragon rules.

380
00:25:39,568 --> 00:25:41,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Double Dragon sucks.

381
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:42,850
[SPEAKER_03]: It has slowdown.

382
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:43,970
[SPEAKER_03]: It has flicker.

383
00:25:44,331 --> 00:25:45,131
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cheap.

384
00:25:45,451 --> 00:25:47,573
[SPEAKER_03]: The weapons don't do shit.

385
00:25:48,173 --> 00:25:49,274
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all about the elbow punch.

386
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:51,660
[SPEAKER_06]: But you are right.

387
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,961
[SPEAKER_06]: There are no good Katamari games.

388
00:25:53,041 --> 00:25:53,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Except for the first one.

389
00:25:54,082 --> 00:25:54,903
[SPEAKER_03]: What other games?

390
00:25:55,003 --> 00:25:55,563
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say this.

391
00:25:55,723 --> 00:26:01,669
[SPEAKER_03]: To Double Dragon's credit, there are no other games where you get assaulted by transsexual bitches carrying whips.

392
00:26:02,209 --> 00:26:05,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, no other game do the trannies come out and force you to try to kick your ass.

393
00:26:05,652 --> 00:26:07,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I can't think of any.

394
00:26:07,474 --> 00:26:08,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Streets of Rage 2.

395
00:26:11,872 --> 00:26:12,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good point, yes.

396
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:46,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Turn off the... We gotta go to the arcade right now and play Yaris, right now.

397
00:26:47,133 --> 00:27:06,704
[SPEAKER_03]: And the minute you launch the game Yaris, for those that forgot, because it's been a few years, and I'm gonna bring back all your haunting memories of the past, the game starts with a Yaris, like, driving... No, no, there's, like, a little robot spider on the ground, and then it pans out, and a big Yaris drives in, and a robot claw comes out of the hood and, like, zaps the robot spider.

398
00:27:07,204 --> 00:27:09,766
[SPEAKER_03]: And I look over at Alan, and Alan just has this, like...

399
00:27:10,646 --> 00:27:10,886
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

400
00:27:11,226 --> 00:27:12,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Look on his face.

401
00:27:12,107 --> 00:27:16,089
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was like a Pixar intro, like a cute car animation.

402
00:27:16,409 --> 00:27:18,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, all right, this is the opening sequence of the game.

403
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,251
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that is the game.

404
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:22,652
[SPEAKER_04]: You're shooting little gas pump spiders.

405
00:27:23,173 --> 00:27:23,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

406
00:27:23,513 --> 00:27:26,574
[SPEAKER_03]: So then I made Alan, I made him play a race.

407
00:27:26,634 --> 00:27:29,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, no, you need to play a really bad game and see what this is like.

408
00:27:29,716 --> 00:27:30,577
[SPEAKER_03]: So I made him play a race.

409
00:27:30,597 --> 00:27:32,217
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when he started going, this is rape.

410
00:27:32,277 --> 00:27:33,218
[SPEAKER_03]: This is emotional rape.

411
00:27:33,258 --> 00:27:33,818
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like it.

412
00:27:33,858 --> 00:27:34,419
[SPEAKER_03]: This is bad.

413
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:36,139
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, yeah.

414
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,961
[SPEAKER_03]: So what did you think of yours?

415
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:43,960
[SPEAKER_04]: I am very happy to hear that it was free.

416
00:27:46,821 --> 00:27:49,703
[SPEAKER_04]: and for promotional purposes only.

417
00:27:51,204 --> 00:27:55,367
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally, once that was over, I redeemed myself with some Fatal Fury special.

418
00:27:55,727 --> 00:28:09,057
[SPEAKER_02]: And not only is it bad in the fact that the game is just horrible and of poor quality, it also is bad in the fact that it led the way to pirating Xbox Live Arcade games on modified consoles.

419
00:28:09,597 --> 00:28:10,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Yaris Exploit.

420
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:22,525
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is no good redeeming value about that game, other than the fact that it can make the bottoms of worst lists and stuff like that.

421
00:28:22,805 --> 00:28:25,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know what else to say about that.

422
00:28:25,206 --> 00:28:32,530
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's kind of funny, though, because we also somehow forgot to mention we were playing Puzzle Fighter 2 over the weekend somehow, and that's a game by Backbone Entertainment did that game.

423
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:36,372
[SPEAKER_03]: They also did Yaris, and you're kind of like, my how the mighty have fallen.

424
00:28:36,392 --> 00:28:36,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

425
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:38,701
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

426
00:28:54,518 --> 00:28:55,799
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

427
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, we'll let her talk about her gaming week when she gets here.

428
00:29:23,641 --> 00:29:24,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Housekeeping tonight.

429
00:29:25,701 --> 00:29:30,262
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, I want to give a big thank you to some of the people behind the scenes at OLR.

430
00:29:30,282 --> 00:29:32,742
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, obviously, we have a lot of people behind the scenes that make things work.

431
00:29:33,382 --> 00:29:35,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Deekman and VXChaseXV who do the website.

432
00:29:36,223 --> 00:29:40,804
[SPEAKER_03]: But also, DarkTetsuya does a lot of work for kind of like writing on the website once in a while.

433
00:29:40,824 --> 00:29:42,704
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know ActDeft does some work with him as well.

434
00:29:43,384 --> 00:29:49,085
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know DarkTetsuya and Misty kind of got together for this side project that is the OLR Best Hits.

435
00:29:49,685 --> 00:29:54,007
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's the greatest hits, if you will, of our first 20 episodes.

436
00:29:54,027 --> 00:30:02,731
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I mean our first 20 episodes, I mean the first 20 episodes from 2002, back when we talked about nothing but DDR.

437
00:30:03,172 --> 00:30:05,833
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's done, it's up, and you can download it.

438
00:30:05,893 --> 00:30:10,235
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing I want to warn you about, it was a totally different show back then.

439
00:30:10,535 --> 00:30:12,616
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

440
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:38,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and we were running a modem friendly, dial-up friendly, 56k friendly radio stream.

441
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:40,888
[SPEAKER_03]: So the audio quality was not that great.

442
00:30:40,908 --> 00:30:46,293
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to warn you, if you're going to go check it out, keep in mind the audio may hurt your ears a little bit because it was dial-up friendly.

443
00:30:46,733 --> 00:30:50,056
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you want to hear the kind of stuff we talked about a year ago, it's pretty cool.

444
00:30:50,096 --> 00:30:51,057
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really want to- A year ago?

445
00:30:51,397 --> 00:30:52,538
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, years ago.

446
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:53,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Haha.

447
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,661
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank DarkSakura for putting that together.

448
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,322
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty funny.

449
00:30:58,983 --> 00:30:59,223
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

450
00:30:59,663 --> 00:31:01,204
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find that at orangeloungeradio.com.

451
00:31:01,224 --> 00:31:02,105
[SPEAKER_03]: It's right there on the front page.

452
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:05,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Other housekeeping tonight.

453
00:31:05,127 --> 00:31:09,730
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have a list list coming up in part B tonight because it is our 360th episode.

454
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:13,733
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a list list in tipping our hat to the Xbox 360 tonight.

455
00:31:14,093 --> 00:31:22,599
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll get into that a little later on in the show in part B. But if you want to vote, you have to be in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

456
00:31:23,211 --> 00:31:25,192
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's get into some actual gaming news.

457
00:31:25,212 --> 00:31:28,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Alan and I have been talking about a lot of old games.

458
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:30,014
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's get into some new games.

459
00:31:30,134 --> 00:31:32,095
[SPEAKER_03]: And oddly enough, some 360 news.

460
00:31:32,135 --> 00:31:32,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Loki?

461
00:31:33,055 --> 00:31:39,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, this week we had some images leak out of a possible slimmed down 360.

462
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:50,183
[SPEAKER_02]: And much like images leaked out before of a 360 with an HDMI port on it, I have to say this is probably going to happen too.

463
00:31:50,623 --> 00:31:52,164
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

464
00:32:09,116 --> 00:32:18,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, they've combined the GPU and CPU into one chip, and it's got an actual, kind of a different cooling system now, just more like a traditional heatsink and fan.

465
00:32:20,419 --> 00:32:29,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the memory card slot is missing, but once again, that kind of gets into something we'll be talking about probably a little bit later.

466
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:34,522
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's interesting, and I have a feeling this is probably going to be out by the end of this year.

467
00:32:35,243 --> 00:32:36,483
[SPEAKER_02]: I will bet you anything.

468
00:32:36,843 --> 00:32:46,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Project Natal Do you think Natal is built into this thing?

469
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,412
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think it is.

470
00:32:48,553 --> 00:32:50,774
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to be just an accessory.

471
00:32:51,015 --> 00:32:57,580
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think the system is going to be slimmed down kind of to appeal to more of the Wii crowd type thing.

472
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they're going to drop the price on it or something.

473
00:32:59,822 --> 00:32:59,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

474
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Now what's the source of these pictures?

475
00:33:02,018 --> 00:33:03,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I want to try and figure out how true this is.

476
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:05,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Because remember guys, this is a rumor.

477
00:33:05,223 --> 00:33:06,885
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's the source of these pictures?

478
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:11,431
[SPEAKER_02]: The source, it's apparently from some Chinese tech forum.

479
00:33:11,752 --> 00:33:13,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently it was...

480
00:33:15,754 --> 00:33:18,458
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking that it's probably leaked from some sort of production line.

481
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:30,338
[SPEAKER_03]: The same type of forum leaked out some other revisions of... Yeah, I seem to remember the first PS3 Slim info was coming from an Asian web forum because that's what the factory...

482
00:33:30,982 --> 00:33:31,803
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

483
00:33:47,958 --> 00:34:10,544
[SPEAKER_02]: um you know stuff like that and different like power headers and what not um that are I mean this one looks like the CD-ROM or the DVD drive and then probably they're gonna have one that's gonna plug into the SATA drive um if it's gonna be internal so it's interesting okay so Loki on a scale of 1 to 10 1 being this is a fucking lie and 10 being this is fucking happening how true is this rumor?

484
00:34:10,664 --> 00:34:15,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say it's probably 10 that's that's a pretty pretty big bet alright well it's okay

485
00:34:15,805 --> 00:34:16,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Where there's smoke, there's fire.

486
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:21,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I realize that we're only a few weeks away from April Fool's Day, but come on.

487
00:34:21,614 --> 00:34:23,917
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it just makes sense that they would do this.

488
00:34:24,157 --> 00:34:29,525
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, with the other news that's coming out, it makes sense why certain things are missing from this.

489
00:34:29,685 --> 00:34:31,328
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know.

490
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:38,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Spyro in our chatroom, chat.orange.com says, we already have normal 360s, we don't need slimmer ones.

491
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:41,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what the PS3 people said too, but now they have slim PS3s.

492
00:34:41,767 --> 00:34:42,887
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the best move they made.

493
00:34:43,908 --> 00:34:45,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they made the cost of the console cheaper.

494
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:46,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

495
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:51,373
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, by consolidating some parts and taking some things that weren't really used very commonly out.

496
00:34:51,413 --> 00:34:53,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what did they take out of the other PS3 model?

497
00:34:54,575 --> 00:34:54,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it USB?

498
00:34:54,895 --> 00:34:57,297
[SPEAKER_02]: They took out USB ports and stuff like that, but...

499
00:34:59,423 --> 00:35:06,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's just slimmer dies and parts get cheaper.

500
00:35:08,307 --> 00:35:09,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and that's my other thought.

501
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:15,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of why I think there is a lot of truth to this is that it makes sense that they're trying to consolidate some of the parts.

502
00:35:15,971 --> 00:35:17,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're talking about a price reduction.

503
00:35:17,432 --> 00:35:26,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Because how awesome would it be if Microsoft gets the price low enough where they can launch a 360 console with Natal for $199,000?

504
00:35:28,117 --> 00:35:30,479
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they charge for their low-end 360 now, right?

505
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:30,479
$199?

506
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,662
[SPEAKER_03]: What if they could do that with Natal for $199?

507
00:35:34,763 --> 00:35:39,407
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a pretty big kick in the pants to Nintendo come this Christmas season.

508
00:35:39,467 --> 00:35:43,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, if that were to happen, it's not out of the question.

509
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:43,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo might say, $99 a week.

510
00:35:47,085 --> 00:35:48,826
[SPEAKER_02]: It might not make a difference.

511
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:55,189
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think right now at the point, I mean, $99 Wii would be kind of cool because then people would be like, oh yeah, I'm going to definitely pick up one of those.

512
00:35:55,269 --> 00:35:58,251
[SPEAKER_02]: But picking up a system doesn't mean you're going to buy the games for it.

513
00:35:58,611 --> 00:36:02,613
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, look at all these people that bought just the Wii for Wii Sports.

514
00:36:03,113 --> 00:36:03,974
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all they're playing.

515
00:36:05,395 --> 00:36:06,755
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're not buying Wii Sports Resort.

516
00:36:07,196 --> 00:36:08,336
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're not buying anything else.

517
00:36:08,516 --> 00:36:09,857
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just playing Wii Sports.

518
00:36:11,707 --> 00:36:14,709
[SPEAKER_02]: or, like me, I haven't played the Wii in months.

519
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:23,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Neither have I. In fact, I was going to hook it up this week to play Rondo of Blood, which for some reason isn't on our show all night, but it finally got its release on Monday, which is exciting.

520
00:36:24,297 --> 00:36:26,999
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because Jamie's not here for Part A tonight, so that's how we missed it.

521
00:36:27,419 --> 00:36:31,062
[SPEAKER_03]: But Rondo of Blood came out, and I was like, oh, I should hook up the Wii and download it.

522
00:36:31,082 --> 00:36:35,546
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I was like, let's play terrible games on the 360 instead, for whatever reason.

523
00:36:36,046 --> 00:36:36,747
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

524
00:36:37,307 --> 00:36:37,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

525
00:36:38,448 --> 00:36:47,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Allen, I know you already own a 360, but do you think there's anything here that maybe somebody who already has a 360 might want to get one of these?

526
00:36:47,332 --> 00:36:50,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think there's anything in here for us gamers that probably already have one?

527
00:36:52,595 --> 00:36:56,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe to try it up so that hopefully the Red Ring of Death...

528
00:36:57,057 --> 00:36:57,858
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

529
00:37:28,117 --> 00:37:28,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

530
00:37:42,563 --> 00:37:43,284
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

531
00:38:03,899 --> 00:38:11,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of curiosity, you brought up modding, and you've talked a lot about the different mods out there, like the JTAGs and so forth, the 360s.

532
00:38:11,504 --> 00:38:13,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think part of this is to combat modding?

533
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:18,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, because the JTAG stuff right now, they've already patched it out.

534
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,250
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you have to have an old enough...

535
00:38:23,231 --> 00:38:24,412
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

536
00:38:52,827 --> 00:39:00,502
[SPEAKER_02]: those now they're figuring out how to mod as well but a lot of them aren't with an old enough dashboard to be able to do it

537
00:39:02,496 --> 00:39:04,538
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they're going to find a way to do something.

538
00:39:04,778 --> 00:39:08,081
[SPEAKER_02]: At the very least, they're going to find ways to add a bigger hard drive if you want it.

539
00:39:08,902 --> 00:39:15,147
[SPEAKER_02]: But they may actually, if they're smart, go the route of Sony and allow you to upgrade your own hard drive.

540
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:23,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we'll see because I think we have another story coming up about further evidence that the Xbox 360 hard drives may be a thing of the past.

541
00:39:23,575 --> 00:39:27,979
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, I want to get into another story about the 360 since it is episode 360 of our show after all.

542
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:30,240
[SPEAKER_03]: and talking about a patent.

543
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:30,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's right.

544
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks to the U.S.

545
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:40,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Patent Office and people having to, you know, file those patents to protect their ideas, sometimes we get spoiled on things that may or may not actually end up happening.

546
00:39:40,284 --> 00:39:41,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I think we've seen patents in the past.

547
00:39:42,445 --> 00:39:49,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't Nintendo trademark, like, or, I mean, I guess there's a difference between trademark and patent, but, you know, for the purposes of rumor spoiling, it's very similar.

548
00:39:49,748 --> 00:39:52,370
[SPEAKER_03]: All those people to try and get to the ideas before them.

549
00:40:17,368 --> 00:40:23,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyhow, this, though, sounds very feasible to me, and this is a Microsoft patent that apparently was filed back in mid-2008.

550
00:40:25,633 --> 00:40:35,579
[SPEAKER_03]: What would happen is that with this interface that they're patenting, you would actually be able to download a game add-on from the Xbox Live Marketplace.

551
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:37,240
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

552
00:41:00,738 --> 00:41:09,803
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be like, for example, I was playing Borderlands, and say my friend was playing, and he wanted to join my game, and he doesn't have the expansion that I have.

553
00:41:11,223 --> 00:41:18,167
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to clarify, I'm sorry, but this is an important point of the trademark, is that the content that you buy is required...

554
00:41:18,547 --> 00:41:19,628
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

555
00:41:43,045 --> 00:42:08,627
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's what you pay for a Microsoft system like it would be that easy I'm imagining other things like Game Room would kind of tie into this too I was trying to think of I was trying to come up with this I was trying to explain to Alan yesterday and I don't think my point really came across very well I was like I think Game Room is kind of like Rock Band I think Game Room kind of has a lot in common with Rock Band it's a system that's really going to make their bucks off of all these microtransactions

556
00:42:09,267 --> 00:42:13,089
[SPEAKER_03]: is where, obviously, they're not making any money off of the shell of the game.

557
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:18,713
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of like, well, yeah, you pay $40 up front for Rock Band, but you get all these default songs.

558
00:42:18,753 --> 00:42:23,115
[SPEAKER_03]: But for Game Room, you pay zero, you get nothing, but the whole thing's out of microtransactions.

559
00:42:23,455 --> 00:42:30,019
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually like, a better comparison would be that Game Room is more like that PSP demo for Rock Band Unplugged.

560
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:30,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember that?

561
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,823
[SPEAKER_03]: They came with one song, and all the rest would play just DLC is all it would play.

562
00:42:37,044 --> 00:42:58,958
[SPEAKER_03]: it's almost kind of like that but for classic games so anyhow but that might be another one hey you go visit your friend's game room and they want to play you in a battle of I don't know what's a two player game Contra or something you know even though you've already bought that on Xbox Live some time ago well you could press X and you can buy Contra for 300 Microsoft points and go to town

563
00:42:59,898 --> 00:43:02,740
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just making it easier to spend your imaginary money, essentially.

564
00:43:05,782 --> 00:43:07,803
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't have to quit the lobby to do so.

565
00:43:07,843 --> 00:43:14,088
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another important thing, too, is that sometimes if you want to buy an expansion, you have to back out of the lobby, go back to the menu, do this.

566
00:43:14,468 --> 00:43:16,329
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it would be a lot faster this way.

567
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:18,330
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

568
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:19,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this dangerous?

569
00:43:20,012 --> 00:43:26,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this something that maybe they shouldn't be implementing because it makes it almost too easy to download games?

570
00:43:26,956 --> 00:43:28,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Or what?

571
00:43:28,317 --> 00:43:29,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is this just a logical?

572
00:43:30,259 --> 00:43:32,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is more of a give me your money type of step.

573
00:43:32,781 --> 00:43:33,922
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just it makes sense.

574
00:43:33,982 --> 00:43:35,023
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it more streamlined.

575
00:43:35,283 --> 00:43:39,767
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you don't have to do it, but I don't know.

576
00:43:39,787 --> 00:43:40,448
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes it easier.

577
00:43:40,808 --> 00:43:47,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I would worry that there's like 13-year-olds that are going to sit there and hit the button, but hopefully their parents know about parental controls and there's no credit cards on file.

578
00:43:48,087 --> 00:43:55,738
[SPEAKER_04]: iTunes and Amazon already have one-click purchasing, where you can just, with, you know, one-click buy TV, whatever.

579
00:43:56,119 --> 00:44:03,750
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to have that, for Xbox to have that in their marketplace, I mean, other online stores are already doing this, so...

580
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:04,690
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

581
00:44:24,281 --> 00:44:39,803
[SPEAKER_03]: and what you do now is if you click you don't click on buy song but you click on the little drop down next to that and you click add to wish list and they say that the wish list replates the shopping cart but I think the way they did that was really shady like I hate the way that Apple handled that

582
00:44:40,203 --> 00:44:40,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

583
00:44:57,237 --> 00:45:12,177
[SPEAKER_03]: and if there was a song I liked that they played on the radio I would go into iTunes search for the artist right there add the song to my cart and like at the end of the week I'd download all the songs I have a new CD for my car like it was an awesome system but then when iTunes switched it up so now it's just click and you buy right away

584
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:14,486
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that kind of was shady.

585
00:45:14,846 --> 00:45:19,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yeah, they have the wish list, but come on, Apple fans.

586
00:45:19,548 --> 00:45:21,288
[SPEAKER_03]: They made that harder to get to.

587
00:45:21,848 --> 00:45:24,309
[SPEAKER_03]: They made it harder to have a queue.

588
00:45:24,509 --> 00:45:29,130
[SPEAKER_03]: They made it easier to buy a game right away, which was kind of crappy in my opinion.

589
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:34,391
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's a good point, Alan, is that this system already really exists in other places.

590
00:45:34,511 --> 00:45:38,492
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's no, even without Microsoft bucks on iTunes, it's real money.

591
00:45:39,266 --> 00:45:41,388
[SPEAKER_03]: USB Storage Support for the Xbox 360

592
00:45:58,927 --> 00:46:10,298
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just bought one of those memory cards not that long ago, although I don't think I bought the half a gig one.

593
00:46:10,458 --> 00:46:11,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I did, but it only cost me $20.

594
00:46:12,199 --> 00:46:18,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever I bought was $20, and it came with Geometry Wars, which I tried to give to Alan, but you couldn't take it off the memory card.

595
00:46:19,426 --> 00:46:36,571
[SPEAKER_02]: which was stupid that is dumb but thankfully you will be able to use your USB memory cards to go ahead and save your games you can do download content, save games games in demand, title updates etc.

596
00:46:38,731 --> 00:47:00,607
[SPEAKER_02]: and um the thing is though you will only be able to use cards up to 16 gigabytes meaning you can't just plug in you know say a USB hard drive or something like that that's 120 gigs or those fucking terabyte drives now that what you just bought one of those not that long ago right how much does that set you back for the one terabyte USB drive

597
00:47:01,127 --> 00:47:02,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, about 110, 120, yeah.

598
00:47:02,548 --> 00:47:06,010
[SPEAKER_03]: It's disgusting how much data you can take with you on the go now.

599
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:15,837
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, at the very least, you can store, you know, say, you know, just without using a USB hub, you know, a good almost 60 gigs on there.

600
00:47:16,077 --> 00:47:24,643
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, now, I'm assuming, I don't know if you can use, like, USB hubs on this, but maybe you could even plug in more drives if you really wanted to.

601
00:47:25,364 --> 00:47:25,544
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

602
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:28,631
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

603
00:47:48,567 --> 00:47:50,769
[SPEAKER_03]: You can play a movie or a music file off a USB stick.

604
00:47:50,809 --> 00:47:53,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can do that, but you can't store stuff from the 360.

605
00:47:54,313 --> 00:47:56,354
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't transfer saves or anything like that.

606
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:58,897
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what this is basically going to allow you to do.

607
00:47:59,337 --> 00:48:07,625
[SPEAKER_02]: However, this also once again plays into what we saw with the supposedly slim 360 motherboard.

608
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,267
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no memory card slot.

609
00:48:09,287 --> 00:48:13,671
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just the front USB port, the back USB port, and that's it.

610
00:48:14,151 --> 00:48:18,916
[SPEAKER_02]: So it makes you think, okay, so they're just going to use USB storage if you want to do a memory card.

611
00:48:19,276 --> 00:48:20,517
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's a good idea.

612
00:48:20,817 --> 00:48:25,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, to be honest, the Microsoft storage is really, really overpriced.

613
00:48:25,962 --> 00:48:28,364
[SPEAKER_02]: And their hard drives are really overpriced.

614
00:48:28,404 --> 00:48:31,967
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do hope that they allow users to use their own hard drives.

615
00:48:32,668 --> 00:48:33,008
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura,

616
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:55,981
[SPEAKER_02]: 10x the storage

617
00:49:13,564 --> 00:49:20,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think, you know, and I'm reading in our chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com, YYR says the limit will be two drives according to reports.

618
00:49:21,168 --> 00:49:25,209
[SPEAKER_03]: But even then, take two 16 gig drives, that's 32 gigs.

619
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:27,290
[SPEAKER_03]: That's still quite a bit.

620
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:32,333
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, it's not as big as the 120 gigabyte, but that's enough for most of you guys.

621
00:49:32,393 --> 00:49:38,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, if you don't do video on the 360 and you don't install a lot of games, you're in good shape.

622
00:49:38,176 --> 00:49:40,737
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly, I don't know how much good it would do to, well...

623
00:49:41,457 --> 00:49:41,997
[SPEAKER_03]: I take that back.

624
00:49:42,137 --> 00:49:46,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think it would do a lot of good to install a game to a USB stick as opposed to just doing it on a regular hard drive?

625
00:49:46,718 --> 00:49:48,918
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the difference would be unnoticeable.

626
00:49:50,059 --> 00:49:53,179
[SPEAKER_02]: But I keep thinking... I would think maybe the USB drive might be a little bit faster.

627
00:49:53,299 --> 00:49:59,360
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to say because the hard drives that are in there right now, they're just... I want to say they're 5,400 RPM.

628
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:06,402
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really... I mean, they're standard for a laptop drive, but when you're talking about desktop drives, they're 7,200...

629
00:50:08,163 --> 00:50:09,284
[SPEAKER_02]: It's obviously a little slower.

630
00:50:09,745 --> 00:50:12,348
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also flash, so there's really no moving parts.

631
00:50:12,829 --> 00:50:18,356
[SPEAKER_02]: So really, you'd be limited by the speed of USB 2.0, which would probably be, I would say, faster than that drive.

632
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:18,950
[SPEAKER_03]: True story.

633
00:50:44,051 --> 00:50:45,032
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a dumb excuse.

634
00:50:45,232 --> 00:50:45,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

635
00:50:46,954 --> 00:50:54,043
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're going to screw you for those hard drives, just use different hard drives.

636
00:50:55,465 --> 00:51:00,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of dumb excuses, let's go to another completely different type of story here.

637
00:51:00,351 --> 00:51:02,754
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a story that has to do with GameStop.

638
00:51:03,354 --> 00:51:05,235
[SPEAKER_03]: and also has to do with console shortages.

639
00:51:05,836 --> 00:51:11,259
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently GameStop has commented on the recent Wii shortages and PlayStation 3 shortages.

640
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:16,143
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're saying that those shortages do not look like they are coming to an end very soon.

641
00:51:17,484 --> 00:51:27,610
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a quote here from Tony Bartell, who is the executive VP of merchandising for GameStop, saying, quote, they could sell a lot more hardware than what we have on both the PS3 and the Wii platform.

642
00:51:27,911 --> 00:51:31,493
[SPEAKER_03]: They are saying it is not going to end until early summer is when this is projected to end.

643
00:51:31,613 --> 00:51:58,675
[SPEAKER_03]: and then by then they're going to have another console iteration and it's just going to be the same damn thing all over again just to clarify they say the Wii is supposed to get the resupply first and he thinks this is all because of the surge of the sales of the consoles from the last holiday season I've heard a different theory though and that has to do with and I don't was it you was telling me this Alan somebody was telling me this about the whole fiscal year that was you on a previous show

644
00:51:59,876 --> 00:52:03,417
[SPEAKER_03]: The fiscal year... Did you think the fiscal year is playing into this on both Nintendo and Sony?

645
00:52:03,858 --> 00:52:04,198
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

646
00:52:04,218 --> 00:52:06,479
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just dicking around though right now is what I know.

647
00:52:06,999 --> 00:52:11,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Because first party anything from Sony is like damn hard to get right now.

648
00:52:13,021 --> 00:52:15,642
[SPEAKER_02]: So, who knows what the situation is.

649
00:52:15,702 --> 00:52:17,063
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, you know, the...

650
00:52:18,163 --> 00:52:19,544
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't see why you would, you know, not.

651
00:52:47,608 --> 00:52:54,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and how many freaking PS3s are being sold right now?

652
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:57,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it just doesn't seem like it's as in demand right now.

653
00:52:57,574 --> 00:52:59,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe for birthdays and stuff, but that's it.

654
00:53:00,235 --> 00:53:02,497
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them have to do with the fact that they're hard to find right now.

655
00:53:02,817 --> 00:53:04,018
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm sorry, I mean...

656
00:53:04,978 --> 00:53:06,299
[SPEAKER_02]: How many years has it been out?

657
00:53:27,174 --> 00:53:32,278
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to purposely hold them back to create this sort of demand for the console.

658
00:53:32,298 --> 00:53:33,098
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty dumb.

659
00:53:33,419 --> 00:53:34,780
[SPEAKER_02]: People are seeing right through it now.

660
00:53:36,181 --> 00:53:43,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Just while Loki's been talking here, I pulled up BestBuy.com just to see because they let you do a store search to see what the inventory looks like.

661
00:53:44,027 --> 00:53:45,688
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a couple packages available.

662
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:46,589
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a $299.99

663
00:53:48,971 --> 00:53:53,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony, PlayStation 3, it's the slim, so it's like the slim by itself.

664
00:53:53,453 --> 00:53:53,853
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the 120.

665
00:53:54,053 --> 00:53:59,155
[SPEAKER_03]: It is sold out online, and if you go into to do like a store search, it won't even let you.

666
00:53:59,175 --> 00:54:00,756
[SPEAKER_03]: It says store pickup, not available.

667
00:54:01,036 --> 00:54:01,896
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is gone.

668
00:54:02,397 --> 00:54:04,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Now there's a $349.99 console.

669
00:54:04,217 --> 00:54:06,258
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a 250 gig.

670
00:54:06,838 --> 00:54:11,160
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy it online, but then there's this red thing that says not available for shipping.

671
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:15,322
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess you could maybe only do the in-store pickup.

672
00:54:15,962 --> 00:54:25,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I did a search around the local zip code here, and the six closest stores in the Sacramento area, Citrus Heights, Arden Fair, Folsom, Roseville, Natomas, Elk Grove, all out.

673
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:26,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Unavailable.

674
00:54:27,012 --> 00:54:28,513
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the shortage is real.

675
00:54:28,553 --> 00:54:29,434
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no disputing that.

676
00:54:30,114 --> 00:54:33,097
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's weird why that this is happening.

677
00:54:34,278 --> 00:54:41,424
[SPEAKER_02]: And, like I said, the theory, and it could be just someone talking, but the theory is that they're

678
00:54:43,257 --> 00:54:44,698
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

679
00:55:06,135 --> 00:55:20,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy XIII, although granted, the whole 360 thing, you know, if gamers want it, and they have a 360 already, they can just buy it there, and I know there's been a lot of back and forth about which version is better, but there's no difference, you guys.

680
00:55:20,738 --> 00:55:23,038
[SPEAKER_03]: The differences are minuscule, so just drop it.

681
00:55:23,058 --> 00:55:30,240
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering on the audio, though, a question just to go on the Final Fantasy real quick, and this is totally random, but how's your audio sounding on that?

682
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:34,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Do their voices sound kind of metallic, I guess, to you?

683
00:55:34,781 --> 00:55:35,041
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

684
00:55:35,821 --> 00:55:37,623
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but that could be your sound setup.

685
00:55:37,704 --> 00:55:45,572
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have surround sound headphones, and I've done everything to try to configure it so that the sound sounds okay, but it still sounds kind of metallic.

686
00:55:45,913 --> 00:55:46,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Seems okay to me.

687
00:55:46,834 --> 00:55:48,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's heavily buffered or something.

688
00:55:48,495 --> 00:55:49,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

689
00:55:50,427 --> 00:55:51,568
[SPEAKER_03]: God of War 3 God of War 3

690
00:56:09,446 --> 00:56:29,892
[SPEAKER_03]: to have your big game out and not have the systems to back it up especially if it's intentional if it really truly is an unintentional shortage then okay whatever just bad luck but if it's an intentional shortage that was dumb then they should have delayed God of War 3 saying you know quality issues or whatever they would have lied and said it was a quality thing or something

691
00:56:30,772 --> 00:56:34,514
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what they have coming out from first party for Sony in the next couple months.

692
00:56:34,994 --> 00:56:35,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much.

693
00:56:35,754 --> 00:56:38,876
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they have Mod Nation Racers, but that's in May.

694
00:56:40,197 --> 00:56:43,398
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after that, well, that's it.

695
00:56:44,258 --> 00:56:48,020
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Mod Nation Racers, which I don't think... Well, and then the move is later in the year.

696
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,301
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not until the holiday.

697
00:56:49,341 --> 00:56:49,561
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

698
00:56:51,764 --> 00:56:52,084
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

699
00:57:16,476 --> 00:57:18,957
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

700
00:57:40,347 --> 00:57:42,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

701
00:57:55,886 --> 00:58:03,475
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, we believe that the loyalty program at Micromania drove some of the highest sales per store in Europe that we've seen.

702
00:58:03,976 --> 00:58:11,105
[SPEAKER_02]: So we think it's a very effective program and that's the base for what we added to our existing loyalty program here at The Edge.

703
00:58:12,407 --> 00:58:12,767
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

704
00:58:19,074 --> 00:58:22,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Micromania had the MegaCart program for many, many years.

705
00:58:22,717 --> 00:58:25,860
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably the most successful video game loyalty program in existence.

706
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:33,227
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at Micromania, as we did early on, 86% of their transactions have a MicroCart ID associated with them.

707
00:58:33,727 --> 00:58:36,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

708
00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:00,991
[SPEAKER_02]: How theirs will be different.

709
00:59:01,251 --> 00:59:07,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Our program will be heavily built on heavily what you see at Micromania today but it will add some very significant pieces.

710
00:59:07,773 --> 00:59:12,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Our marketing team has done some extensive surveys like we saw linked online.

711
00:59:14,835 --> 00:59:16,097
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

712
00:59:33,557 --> 00:59:33,898
[SPEAKER_02]: and many more.

713
00:59:59,983 --> 01:00:04,647
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like when you're reading a story like this about GameStop and their programs I should be playing a song like this We can try that

714
01:00:16,778 --> 01:00:17,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Join us in our rewards program.

715
01:00:49,179 --> 01:00:50,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, seriously though.

716
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:53,421
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, is there enough here to really get that customer list?

717
01:00:53,541 --> 01:00:56,203
[SPEAKER_03]: As if they needed to stomp out more of their competitors.

718
01:00:57,164 --> 01:00:59,445
[SPEAKER_02]: They're completely vague in that though, so that's the thing.

719
01:00:59,705 --> 01:01:08,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless I see a sheet that says what I'm getting exactly and what I have to pay into it to get, I'm not exactly sure if it's something I really want to participate in.

720
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:16,255
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, if it's like the end of the GameStop cards now where I pay $15 a year and I get discounts and whatnot, I mean, that's kind of cool, I guess.

721
01:01:16,496 --> 01:01:17,556
[SPEAKER_02]: And I get a magazine at least.

722
01:01:17,596 --> 01:01:18,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I can thumb through it once a month.

723
01:01:20,418 --> 01:01:21,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Frisbee in our chat room says...

724
01:01:22,993 --> 01:01:24,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I am your retailer.

725
01:01:41,656 --> 01:02:00,849
[SPEAKER_03]: and this has been done with quite a few Sony games if I'm not mistaken and probably some 360 ones too I can't think of right now but depending on where you pre-order it is the bonus you're going to get and the bonus has to do with the extra kart racers now if you decide to order from GameStop you will get Kratos from God of War which I'm sure is going to be a very popular one

726
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:05,852
[SPEAKER_03]: We can also pre-order from Amazon, and you can get either Ratchet or Clank.

727
01:02:05,992 --> 01:02:09,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how that works, if you pick when you use the code or what happens.

728
01:02:09,614 --> 01:02:10,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you get both.

729
01:02:11,935 --> 01:02:13,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you do get both, I don't know.

730
01:02:13,435 --> 01:02:17,337
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Best Buy, you get Nathan Drake from Uncharted, which is actually pretty cool.

731
01:02:17,657 --> 01:02:19,478
[SPEAKER_03]: He looks like a me, honestly.

732
01:02:19,558 --> 01:02:21,039
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like one of the Wii characters.

733
01:02:21,059 --> 01:02:26,281
[SPEAKER_03]: When you look at the little picture of Nathan Drake, honestly, it looks like a little me there, but that's what it is.

734
01:02:27,001 --> 01:02:28,502
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion...

735
01:02:29,696 --> 01:02:33,159
[SPEAKER_03]: I do love God of War, don't get me wrong, but I think the Uncharted guy is the coolest.

736
01:02:33,199 --> 01:02:35,581
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I would get it from Best Buy just to get Nathan Drake.

737
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:46,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I'm sure at some point they're all going to be microtransactions on the Sony marketplace anyway, but if you want to cut that corner, you can do the pre-order there.

738
01:02:48,591 --> 01:02:53,735
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, also, you do get some type of mystery mod package when you pre-order the game.

739
01:02:54,156 --> 01:02:55,197
[SPEAKER_03]: You get pictures...

740
01:02:56,097 --> 01:03:16,606
[SPEAKER_03]: and you get other accessories to outfit your racer and uh yep you don't know exactly what stuff you're getting until you input the code it's like kind of one of those like mystery pins at Disneyland but that's what it is so could be interesting any interest in Mod Nation Racers you're gonna run out and get this game day one

741
01:03:17,122 --> 01:03:21,127
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure, I have it on order, but I'm not sure if I'm going to pick it up right away.

742
01:03:21,587 --> 01:03:25,491
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks neat, but I just have a feeling it's not going to be as good as LittleBigPlanet.

743
01:03:26,533 --> 01:03:31,578
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really, they're trying to get us to think that it's going to be LittleBigPlanet, you know, the kart racing game.

744
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:37,565
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's not what it's going to be, but it'll be pretty cool.

745
01:03:38,157 --> 01:03:38,697
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

746
01:03:56,167 --> 01:03:56,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

747
01:04:11,787 --> 01:04:12,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

748
01:04:28,268 --> 01:04:29,729
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe I forgot to mention that

749
01:04:52,182 --> 01:04:53,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have some codes.

750
01:04:53,944 --> 01:04:55,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll give those away later in the show.

751
01:04:55,426 --> 01:04:55,706
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

752
01:04:56,287 --> 01:04:58,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Do any chatters want a blur beta code?

753
01:04:58,889 --> 01:05:00,171
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give some away later if so.

754
01:05:00,471 --> 01:05:00,952
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do that.

755
01:05:01,292 --> 01:05:01,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

756
01:05:05,177 --> 01:05:29,753
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100 Matt says the soundboard works great in blur because you know he has the soundboard with the Duke Nukem stuff and everything I don't know how he's doing it he's patching it through the 360 voice thing somehow and yeah he can play all these random things he's playing so if anyone in chat wants a blur beta code I'll give some away later maybe I'll give them away during list list because they sent me three others and I know at least I know Alan's gonna want one but I can give the other two away so I'll give those away to listeners why not

757
01:05:31,034 --> 01:05:33,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, in the chat room saying, please, sure, yay.

758
01:05:33,956 --> 01:05:39,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I will give them away to random voters in our listless event later tonight, so stay tuned.

759
01:05:39,501 --> 01:05:39,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay tuned.

760
01:05:40,322 --> 01:05:41,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, meanwhile...

761
01:05:43,194 --> 01:05:44,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get into some, what, release dates?

762
01:05:44,694 --> 01:05:45,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we ready for release dates?

763
01:05:45,755 --> 01:05:46,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's do release dates.

764
01:05:47,135 --> 01:05:57,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, this week there's some decent stuff coming out, but let's start with some stuff that's not quite what you may be looking for, but hey, you've got people that you know that are kids and stuff, right?

765
01:05:57,899 --> 01:06:03,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Zuzu Pets, yes, the crazy thing that they were selling during the holiday that went like crazy.

766
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:09,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Little pet hamsters now coming to Activision, or coming from Activision to the Nintendo DS.

767
01:06:09,802 --> 01:06:12,243
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, you can actually snag one with a little baby hamster that

768
01:06:13,443 --> 01:06:16,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue and Yellow, that's one sick hamster.

769
01:06:17,484 --> 01:06:20,445
[SPEAKER_02]: How to Train Your Dragon, coming out, tying in with the new movie.

770
01:06:20,885 --> 01:06:26,427
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to be on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and I believe PSP.

771
01:06:27,427 --> 01:06:33,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Bakugan Battle Trainer, the sequel to the marble battling game, or I don't know.

772
01:06:34,229 --> 01:06:51,785
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going to be coming out to DS MotoGP 0910 I guess they're kind of combining years because they didn't have one come out last year that'll be coming out on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 Just Cause 2 coming out on PC, Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 this week looks like a pretty fun game

773
01:06:52,745 --> 01:07:09,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Red Steel 2 guaranteed to be better than the first one coming out on the Wii does require Wii Motion Plus so you can also pick up the Wii Motion Plus bundle for an extra $10 and save you like $9 off the cost of Wii Motion Plus if you don't have it

774
01:07:11,216 --> 01:07:16,461
[SPEAKER_02]: My Pet Chimp, coming out to Nintendo DS from 505 Games.

775
01:07:16,481 --> 01:07:22,367
[SPEAKER_02]: 505 Games, I may add, was also the company that put out that really crappy baby game that I put on my Twitter.

776
01:07:23,228 --> 01:07:26,291
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they may be a good candidate to hit up for the President Cat.

777
01:07:26,331 --> 01:07:27,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I retweeted that.

778
01:07:27,773 --> 01:07:29,935
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell was that?

779
01:07:30,235 --> 01:07:32,738
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an actual baby doll thing or something, right?

780
01:07:32,898 --> 01:07:34,058
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the special edition.

781
01:07:34,139 --> 01:07:42,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you can buy it with a... It's basically a... It comes with a holster for your Wii that you attach to any baby doll.

782
01:07:42,422 --> 01:07:43,582
[SPEAKER_02]: But this one does come with a baby doll.

783
01:07:43,602 --> 01:07:44,883
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like an umbilical cord.

784
01:07:45,383 --> 01:07:50,505
[SPEAKER_02]: And you play these little mini games like feeding the baby and whatnot.

785
01:07:50,805 --> 01:07:55,887
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just funny though because the baby doll that comes with the little special edition has like a lazy eye.

786
01:07:56,407 --> 01:07:57,268
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looks funny.

787
01:07:59,249 --> 01:08:01,711
[SPEAKER_03]: What happens if you shake the baby?

788
01:08:02,131 --> 01:08:03,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that you should do that.

789
01:08:03,072 --> 01:08:03,732
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not funny.

790
01:08:04,332 --> 01:08:04,733
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

791
01:08:04,773 --> 01:08:16,120
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you read the actual page or whatever, but he was tasked with putting powder on the baby and they told him to stop, but he kept doing it anyways, covering the baby in powder.

792
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:16,561
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.

793
01:08:16,601 --> 01:08:19,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if you tried to play WarioWare with the baby peripheral, that might be a lot of fun.

794
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:25,611
[SPEAKER_02]: No, what you need to do, though, is you use the baby peripheral with other games.

795
01:08:25,691 --> 01:08:26,971
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what he's saying.

796
01:08:27,051 --> 01:08:28,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Play WarioWare with the baby peripheral.

797
01:08:29,752 --> 01:08:29,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Aim.

798
01:08:30,512 --> 01:08:31,012
[SPEAKER_02]: A button.

799
01:08:31,552 --> 01:08:34,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Or like Wii Sports, like baseball or something like that.

800
01:08:35,733 --> 01:08:36,393
[SPEAKER_03]: You're bad.

801
01:08:36,833 --> 01:08:38,013
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be awesome.

802
01:08:38,853 --> 01:08:39,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Now there's a YouTube.

803
01:08:39,894 --> 01:08:42,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we need to find the baby game just to do that for YouTube.

804
01:08:42,734 --> 01:08:47,515
[SPEAKER_03]: And G Ditz in our chat room makes the mandatory South Park reference.

805
01:08:47,655 --> 01:08:48,615
[SPEAKER_03]: South Park reference.

806
01:08:48,695 --> 01:08:49,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I'm eating too.

807
01:08:49,816 --> 01:08:50,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Kick the baby.

808
01:08:52,056 --> 01:09:05,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Cabela's Monster Bunk, er, Monster Bunk, yes, it's a giant bunk bed, no, Monster Buck Hunter, cause it's a deer hunting game, comes with a gun, oh yeah, perfect for the redneck in ya.

809
01:09:06,019 --> 01:09:12,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Rooms, the first building, coming out from, uh, Konami on the Wii and DS.

810
01:09:13,681 --> 01:09:32,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Shimogami Tensei, Strange Journey, coming out on DS as well Disney's Stitch Jam, kind of a music platformer game, coming out also on the DS Settler 7, Paths to a Kingdom, coming out on PC from Ubisoft, yes with really crappy DRM

811
01:09:33,397 --> 01:09:35,459
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

812
01:09:57,676 --> 01:10:17,794
[SPEAKER_02]: and let's see this is an accessory though but the Nyko wand they're going to be doing the action pack you remember the Nyko wands like the third party controller that actually you can kind of move the buttons on it so you can plug it into this gun attachment it actually has a physical button for the trigger instead of like you know a trigger that pushes the B button on the bottom of the gun

813
01:10:18,914 --> 01:10:22,556
[SPEAKER_02]: and then coming out a week from now, America's Test Kitchen, Let's Get Cooking.

814
01:10:22,956 --> 01:10:31,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming from Nintendo, let's be honest here folks, this is really just them repackaging that stupid learn to cook game that they put out a couple years ago.

815
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,460
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks exactly the same.

816
01:10:34,101 --> 01:10:34,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

817
01:10:35,121 --> 01:10:41,405
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the better game of the two, WarioWare DIY will be coming out on Sunday.

818
01:10:41,785 --> 01:10:48,229
[SPEAKER_02]: And to go with those, the Nintendo DSi XL in bronze and burgundy.

819
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:53,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect for your Pokemon adventures and your little Pokeball walking trainer.

820
01:10:53,593 --> 01:10:56,174
[SPEAKER_02]: They should really just call it like bronze and Ron Burgundy.

821
01:10:59,484 --> 01:10:59,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, boy.

822
01:11:01,066 --> 01:11:02,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, how did I... Oh, wait.

823
01:11:02,829 --> 01:11:03,269
[SPEAKER_02]: No, never mind.

824
01:11:03,489 --> 01:11:04,210
[SPEAKER_02]: That comes out next week.

825
01:11:05,172 --> 01:11:06,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the week after next.

826
01:11:07,254 --> 01:11:07,615
[SPEAKER_02]: What does?

827
01:11:07,995 --> 01:11:08,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, free running.

828
01:11:08,837 --> 01:11:09,377
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of neat.

829
01:11:10,138 --> 01:11:10,999
[SPEAKER_02]: What is free running?

830
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:11,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Like parkour.

831
01:11:12,061 --> 01:11:12,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Mirror's Edge.

832
01:11:13,162 --> 01:11:13,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

833
01:11:13,483 --> 01:11:13,983
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of cool.

834
01:11:14,184 --> 01:11:15,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Except not as cool.

835
01:11:15,748 --> 01:11:16,488
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

836
01:11:37,178 --> 01:11:42,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Another game coming out that does not look like a dating sim is Hokuto Musou comes out.

837
01:11:42,981 --> 01:11:46,003
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a punch and kick type of game.

838
01:11:47,004 --> 01:11:48,925
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if they have this out in America.

839
01:11:48,945 --> 01:11:51,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think if there's a localized version of it.

840
01:11:51,606 --> 01:11:52,627
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

841
01:11:52,667 --> 01:11:55,188
[SPEAKER_03]: For some reason, it looks very like Fist of the North Star-ish to me.

842
01:11:55,848 --> 01:11:56,789
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something Warriors.

843
01:11:58,050 --> 01:11:59,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, wait a second.

844
01:11:59,150 --> 01:11:59,510
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?

845
01:12:01,031 --> 01:12:03,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, it's the fifth North Star Dynasty Wars game.

846
01:12:04,312 --> 01:12:05,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

847
01:12:05,253 --> 01:12:05,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Gomi.

848
01:12:06,233 --> 01:12:07,254
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually identified that.

849
01:12:08,374 --> 01:12:12,596
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see, what else is coming out on the PlayStation 3?

850
01:12:12,696 --> 01:12:18,038
[SPEAKER_03]: The God of War trilogy, as well as God of War 3, makes its way out to Japan as well.

851
01:12:18,118 --> 01:12:20,479
[SPEAKER_03]: So they get their versions not that long after we did.

852
01:12:20,999 --> 01:12:23,420
[SPEAKER_03]: And Hukotu Mosu also comes out over there.

853
01:12:25,061 --> 01:12:29,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Pachipada 15, Super Umi Monogatari in Okinawa 2

854
01:12:44,055 --> 01:12:45,216
[SPEAKER_03]: That is out on the PlayStation 3.

855
01:12:46,116 --> 01:12:50,539
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the Nintendo Wii, Silent Hill Shattered Memories gets its release in Japan.

856
01:12:50,879 --> 01:12:54,941
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to run and open doors and stuff, that is coming out on the Nintendo Wii.

857
01:12:54,982 --> 01:12:56,582
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also coming out on the PlayStation 2.

858
01:12:58,103 --> 01:13:07,909
[SPEAKER_03]: The Nintendo DS gets a bunch of a variety of different games this week, like some type of phonics game and a wrestling game, but nothing that really big that's worth talking about, to be honest.

859
01:13:07,929 --> 01:13:09,370
[SPEAKER_03]: But the Sony PSP gets...

860
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:12,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Burst Error, Eve the First.

861
01:13:12,911 --> 01:13:14,472
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know what that game is.

862
01:13:14,532 --> 01:13:21,955
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks like a little... I guess... Oh, it's a sequel to a PC game from the mid-90s, Burst Error.

863
01:13:22,015 --> 01:13:22,775
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what this is.

864
01:13:23,275 --> 01:13:27,177
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've turned it into Chicks with Guns and Abnormally Large Boobies.

865
01:13:27,397 --> 01:13:27,717
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

866
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:28,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that screenshot right there.

867
01:13:29,337 --> 01:13:30,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Big, big boobies.

868
01:13:31,298 --> 01:13:35,020
[SPEAKER_03]: And also coming out on the Sony PSP, Prinny 2.

[SPEAKER_09]: Outro Music Outro Music

[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it was fantastic.

01:14:32,274 --> 01:14:34,335
[SPEAKER_09]: And I brought the metashevitz.

874
01:14:34,736 --> 01:14:34,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

875
01:14:35,016 --> 01:14:37,058
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like, we didn't tell anyone to bring the wine.

876
01:14:37,118 --> 01:14:37,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Bring the wine.

877
01:14:37,839 --> 01:14:38,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

878
01:14:38,419 --> 01:14:39,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to do UK release dates?

879
01:14:40,421 --> 01:14:41,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I can.

880
01:14:41,142 --> 01:14:42,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to do UK release dates?

881
01:14:42,503 --> 01:14:43,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we're ready.

882
01:14:43,043 --> 01:14:43,844
[SPEAKER_03]: We're ready for you.

883
01:14:43,864 --> 01:14:45,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, I had everything up already.

884
01:14:45,565 --> 01:14:47,387
[SPEAKER_03]: You got here just in time for your first story.

885
01:14:47,407 --> 01:14:47,988
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you like that?

886
01:14:48,028 --> 01:14:48,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Look.

887
01:14:48,588 --> 01:14:52,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we didn't have you slated for anything earlier, but you got here just in time for your first story.

888
01:14:52,372 --> 01:14:53,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you want to talk about your gaming week real quick?

889
01:14:54,737 --> 01:14:55,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, Gaming Week?

890
01:14:56,777 --> 01:14:58,578
[SPEAKER_03]: I just assumed Star Trek Online and Peggle.

891
01:14:58,698 --> 01:14:59,558
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I told the listeners.

892
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:01,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, no, I didn't play Peggle at all, actually.

893
01:15:02,199 --> 01:15:09,400
[SPEAKER_09]: I did play Star Trek Online, and I was about to start Final Fantasy II, except, um, I think I got a phone call, because it was on my phone.

894
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:09,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

895
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:11,420
[SPEAKER_03]: I got it for iPhone.

896
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:13,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn those phone calls interrupting your game.

897
01:15:13,321 --> 01:15:14,181
[SPEAKER_09]: I got it for iPhone.

898
01:15:14,981 --> 01:15:19,242
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um, and then Dan was playing Gauntlet.

899
01:15:20,652 --> 01:15:22,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, on the NES.

900
01:15:23,053 --> 01:15:23,833
[SPEAKER_09]: No, on the Genesis.

901
01:15:23,853 --> 01:15:24,793
[SPEAKER_09]: He was playing Genesis Gauntlet.

902
01:15:25,013 --> 01:15:25,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

903
01:15:25,454 --> 01:15:26,634
[SPEAKER_03]: You missed it earlier in the show.

904
01:15:26,814 --> 01:15:29,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan and I played Double Dragon on the Xbox this week.

905
01:15:29,415 --> 01:15:32,256
[SPEAKER_03]: And we think it's like the most horrible arcade game in existence.

906
01:15:32,436 --> 01:15:34,376
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of those games just kind of sucks.

907
01:15:34,937 --> 01:15:36,437
[SPEAKER_03]: But Dan came in here and yelled at us.

908
01:15:36,457 --> 01:15:39,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he thinks Double Dragon's awesome.

909
01:15:39,790 --> 01:15:40,250
[SPEAKER_09]: He would.

910
01:15:41,691 --> 01:15:44,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, UK release dates, DarkSakura, just in time.

911
01:15:44,513 --> 01:15:45,214
[SPEAKER_09]: What week is this?

912
01:15:45,474 --> 01:15:46,955
[SPEAKER_09]: The 21st through the 27th, huh?

913
01:15:47,796 --> 01:15:50,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, on the 24th, Game Room, Xbox 360.

914
01:15:50,718 --> 01:15:54,780
[SPEAKER_09]: God, why do they keep changing the date?

915
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:59,023
[SPEAKER_09]: BlazBlue, Calamity Trigger, Clash of the Titans, Echo Shift.

916
01:15:59,283 --> 01:16:00,164
[SPEAKER_09]: That's actually a cool name.

917
01:16:00,724 --> 01:16:06,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Infinite Space, Just Cause 2, Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver, whatever.

918
01:16:07,969 --> 01:16:08,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, okay.

919
01:16:12,262 --> 01:16:13,703
[SPEAKER_09]: How different can they do a Pokemon game?

920
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:16,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you have the walking trainer this time, but it's a Pokeball.

921
01:16:16,865 --> 01:16:17,745
[SPEAKER_09]: I had one of those.

922
01:16:18,546 --> 01:16:20,447
[SPEAKER_09]: I had one of those and that's all it was.

923
01:16:20,868 --> 01:16:22,729
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was yellow and it was in black and white.

924
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:25,360
[SPEAKER_03]: But this one has Pokemans in it.

925
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Mine had Pokemans in it.

926
01:16:27,741 --> 01:16:28,121
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

927
01:16:28,141 --> 01:16:31,942
[SPEAKER_03]: You grow your mudkips by walking around the block.

928
01:16:32,002 --> 01:16:33,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Mine had Pokeman in it.

929
01:16:33,442 --> 01:16:34,282
[SPEAKER_09]: It had Pikachu.

930
01:16:37,823 --> 01:16:38,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Where am I?

931
01:16:38,863 --> 01:16:39,823
[SPEAKER_09]: I would play the MMO though.

932
01:16:40,263 --> 01:16:42,724
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's Racket Sports Party.

933
01:16:43,444 --> 01:16:47,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I would play the Pokemon MMO and I would play Pokemon Snap 2 if they ever made it.

934
01:16:47,085 --> 01:16:48,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you play it in a box?

935
01:16:48,325 --> 01:16:49,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you play it with a fox?

936
01:16:49,445 --> 01:16:52,386
[SPEAKER_03]: I would play it on a train and I would play it in the rain.

937
01:16:52,406 --> 01:16:53,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Could you with a mouse?

938
01:16:54,459 --> 01:16:55,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut the fuck up and read the dates.

939
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:14,808
[SPEAKER_09]: Resonance of Fate, Red Steel 2, Rugu Attack, Rugu Twisted Towers, Star Wars The Force Unleashed Ultimate Sith Edition, Die Siddler 7, Warriors Legends of Troy.

940
01:17:14,928 --> 01:17:16,669
[SPEAKER_09]: God, they're just putting everything right together.

941
01:17:17,349 --> 01:17:18,689
[SPEAKER_09]: I may as well do next week too.

942
01:17:18,749 --> 01:17:20,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Shoot, Grand Theft Auto 4 or whatever.

943
01:17:21,141 --> 01:17:21,741
[SPEAKER_03]: But again?

944
01:17:21,981 --> 01:17:23,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is that like a price reduction?

945
01:17:23,081 --> 01:17:24,122
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the Lost in the Damned thing.

946
01:17:24,242 --> 01:17:25,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, gotcha.

947
01:17:25,862 --> 01:17:29,383
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, our chat room jumping out here and screaming some corrections here.

948
01:17:29,443 --> 01:17:31,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Lama Juice, it's not new, it's gold and silver.

949
01:17:31,963 --> 01:17:33,843
[SPEAKER_03]: And Lama Juice says, the game is actually fun.

950
01:17:34,724 --> 01:17:37,624
[SPEAKER_03]: And DarkTetsuya says, your Pokemans, please show us them.

951
01:17:37,944 --> 01:17:40,245
[SPEAKER_03]: AlphaKineticGram says, gold kicked ass.

952
01:17:40,405 --> 01:17:41,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Gold kicked ass.

953
01:17:41,465 --> 01:17:43,265
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought Pearl was fun until I stopped going to the gym.

954
01:17:43,545 --> 01:17:47,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Spike McRu says, yeah, but gold and silver were the best, let's be honest.

955
01:17:48,214 --> 01:17:49,154
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no.

956
01:17:49,194 --> 01:17:51,855
[SPEAKER_09]: The pinnacle is Pokemon Snap.

957
01:17:52,856 --> 01:17:55,957
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this gal on my Twitter friends list and I don't know her real well.

958
01:17:56,017 --> 01:17:59,958
[SPEAKER_03]: I think she runs Gaming Angels, I want to say is the name of the site.

959
01:18:00,158 --> 01:18:00,878
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I got that right.

960
01:18:01,778 --> 01:18:05,380
[SPEAKER_03]: And she made this tweet that I just found hilarious because I kind of could see myself.

961
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:10,661
[SPEAKER_03]: She said something like, I'm in line right now waiting to get the new Pokemon game.

962
01:18:10,701 --> 01:18:11,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm 33 years old.

963
01:18:12,022 --> 01:18:12,282
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

964
01:18:12,302 --> 01:18:12,522
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

965
01:18:14,921 --> 01:18:18,766
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, oh, that must be awkward to be in the midnight launch line for Pokemon.

966
01:18:20,508 --> 01:18:22,930
[SPEAKER_09]: My Pokemans let you not show them to me.

967
01:18:23,091 --> 01:18:26,274
[SPEAKER_03]: But I gotta say, there's quite a few people I know that are playing the new Pokemon game.

968
01:18:26,474 --> 01:18:29,598
[SPEAKER_03]: I almost, almost want to get it.

969
01:18:30,139 --> 01:18:31,941
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm afraid if I do, Alan will break up with me.

970
01:18:32,141 --> 01:18:33,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, he's like, no, I can't.

971
01:18:33,122 --> 01:18:34,343
[SPEAKER_09]: If you do, I'll disown you, Rob.

972
01:18:36,457 --> 01:18:38,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan, would you break up with me if I got the Pokemon game?

973
01:18:38,417 --> 01:18:40,078
[SPEAKER_03]: I have nothing against Pokemon.

974
01:18:40,158 --> 01:18:40,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

975
01:18:40,438 --> 01:18:41,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to play Pokemon together?

976
01:18:42,278 --> 01:18:46,019
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll both get the game and then run around the block and evolve our Pokemon.

977
01:18:46,079 --> 01:18:47,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, you're such a five-year-old girl.

978
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:50,480
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

979
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:51,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to get it.

980
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:57,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, but Spyro and Chat, oh, and Ionotropic I should give credit to first, jump in and say Pokemon Pinball rules all.

981
01:18:58,121 --> 01:18:59,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Abso-fucking-lutely.

982
01:19:00,042 --> 01:19:01,522
[SPEAKER_03]: That was an amazing game.

983
01:19:01,962 --> 01:19:02,762
[SPEAKER_03]: A++.

984
01:19:02,842 --> 01:19:03,663
[SPEAKER_03]: I will sign off on that.

985
01:19:03,683 --> 01:19:05,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Still burning from the damn horseradish.

986
01:19:05,942 --> 01:19:07,802
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also really kind of hot in the studio right now.

987
01:19:07,862 --> 01:19:12,123
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I've got this thing that I used to tie the curtains back with, Rob, so you can actually have airflow.

988
01:19:12,163 --> 01:19:12,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

989
01:19:12,523 --> 01:19:15,644
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, I was going to ask you when you got here, were you able to do the orange scarf after all?

990
01:19:15,984 --> 01:19:17,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Or did that not finish?

991
01:19:17,304 --> 01:19:18,084
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

992
01:19:18,344 --> 01:19:19,764
[SPEAKER_09]: I've had no time.

993
01:19:19,784 --> 01:19:20,404
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I understand.

994
01:19:20,504 --> 01:19:20,945
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand.

995
01:19:21,125 --> 01:19:27,146
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to, before I talk about PAX East and Part B, I want to make sure I have... I'll try to get this monstrosity finished.

996
01:19:27,286 --> 01:19:31,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I leave on Tuesday night, so... I'm good.

997
01:19:31,746 --> 01:19:32,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, alright.

998
01:19:32,487 --> 01:19:34,107
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think I can get it done.

999
01:19:34,127 --> 01:19:34,967
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll ship it to you.

1000
01:19:35,467 --> 01:19:35,727
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1001
01:19:36,507 --> 01:19:40,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, let's move on with some more crash, bang, boom.

1002
01:19:40,069 --> 01:19:41,649
[SPEAKER_03]: There's chaos going on in the studio.

1003
01:19:41,989 --> 01:19:43,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get back to some gaming news.

1004
01:19:43,370 --> 01:19:46,171
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a couple more stories than the classic game of the week, Loki.

1005
01:19:46,751 --> 01:19:47,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1006
01:19:47,591 --> 01:19:57,234
[SPEAKER_02]: So with Game Room coming out very soon, actually, it's interesting to find out that there's actually going to be some achievements tied in with Game Room.

1007
01:19:57,294 --> 01:20:01,996
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that they were just going to be tied in with actual games, but apparently it's Game Room.

1008
01:20:02,736 --> 01:20:08,239
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be 1,000 achievement points to be had and 56 achievements altogether.

1009
01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:12,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, you get points every three medals that you earn.

1010
01:20:13,441 --> 01:20:19,744
[SPEAKER_02]: There's even some points, I guess, for spending time in the arcade, 36 hours total.

1011
01:20:21,645 --> 01:20:23,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting that they have that.

1012
01:20:26,187 --> 01:20:26,447
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1013
01:20:26,467 --> 01:20:28,048
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about achievements in Game Room?

1014
01:20:28,834 --> 01:20:29,455
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1015
01:20:44,950 --> 01:20:48,473
[SPEAKER_03]: The game is Game Room, it's just the classic games are the songs.

1016
01:20:48,513 --> 01:20:50,174
[SPEAKER_03]: They're the microtransaction.

1017
01:20:50,594 --> 01:20:58,880
[SPEAKER_03]: It does seem like, though, if you actually read through the list of achievements, most of them are driven by the medals that you win from playing the classic games.

1018
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:02,483
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're still going to have to have a variety of classic games in order to get all the achievements.

1019
01:21:02,823 --> 01:21:06,106
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's pretty cool that they allowed them to bump it up to 1,000.

1020
01:21:06,646 --> 01:21:08,988
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you're looking at a full game.

1021
01:21:09,748 --> 01:21:12,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, it's just kind of a different type of method of getting it out there.

1022
01:21:13,203 --> 01:21:26,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely, and like some of the achievements in there, they have achievements for themes, like place a theme in your arcade, they have one for placing five unique themes in your arcade, theme your entire arcade with unique themes, your mascots, props, visitors.

1023
01:21:26,732 --> 01:21:33,697
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like some of those are really easy achievements, unless you have to do something to earn those decorations.

1024
01:21:33,937 --> 01:21:37,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the decorations, the thing that worries me about the decorations is you have to buy those.

1025
01:21:38,841 --> 01:21:41,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, didn't they say that some you would get for buying the game on release day?

1026
01:21:42,003 --> 01:21:42,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

1027
01:21:43,973 --> 01:21:47,474
[SPEAKER_02]: But still it's buying something You know what I mean?

1028
01:21:48,375 --> 01:21:50,115
[SPEAKER_02]: I do Am I buying achievement points?

1029
01:21:53,076 --> 01:22:13,063
[SPEAKER_03]: In a way you are If you don't buy any games for Game Room You can't get those medal based achievements Well I take it back You could do it using the quarter method But you're going to have to spend money one way or the other I'll check it out It'll be interesting to see I don't know how much I'm really going to play of it though

1030
01:22:13,672 --> 01:22:15,593
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to lie, I'm super excited about Game Room.

1031
01:22:15,613 --> 01:22:18,975
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all about the classic games, but remember, I do have a couple rules.

1032
01:22:19,135 --> 01:22:23,898
[SPEAKER_03]: My number one rule is, I will not buy a game that they've already released on Xbox Live Arcade.

1033
01:22:24,258 --> 01:22:28,361
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't be looking for me in Scramble or Tempest, because I already have those games.

1034
01:22:28,421 --> 01:22:30,422
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not buying them in Game Room.

1035
01:22:30,462 --> 01:22:31,603
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care how pretty it is.

1036
01:22:33,024 --> 01:22:37,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, one more story for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week.

1037
01:22:37,326 --> 01:22:40,748
[SPEAKER_03]: And this has to do with something I actually mentioned during the release dates a couple weeks ago.

1038
01:22:40,828 --> 01:22:41,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I think it was last week.

1039
01:22:42,329 --> 01:22:45,991
[SPEAKER_03]: On the PlayStation 3 this week, they released in Japan something called Torn.

1040
01:22:46,411 --> 01:22:47,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, guess what?

1041
01:22:47,171 --> 01:22:54,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, Famitsu is reporting that shops in Japan are selling out of this, the standalone version of the Torn DVR peripheral.

1042
01:22:55,215 --> 01:22:56,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1043
01:23:15,166 --> 01:23:15,667
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1044
01:23:32,745 --> 01:23:40,609
[SPEAKER_03]: but think about how cool it would be if they would just release that freaking thing over here imagine if they released TiVo for your Playstation 3 would you buy it?

1045
01:23:40,830 --> 01:23:55,838
[SPEAKER_03]: I would, absolutely I don't have DVR on Comcast because I don't think the DVR that Comcast offers is that great to be honest I like how TiVo will do the recommended shows and all that stuff too and the DVR on Comcast is kind of clunky for me

1046
01:23:56,132 --> 01:23:57,253
[SPEAKER_09]: I have something that does that.

1047
01:23:57,793 --> 01:24:00,415
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called the internet and downloading.

1048
01:24:01,856 --> 01:24:02,657
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I know.

1049
01:24:03,798 --> 01:24:10,943
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually ready to cancel our cable and get a different internet provider because Dan sometimes watches TV but we hooked up a computer in the front room and watched Hulu.

1050
01:24:11,801 --> 01:24:15,484
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a decent rate going on right now.

1051
01:24:15,524 --> 01:24:20,707
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a special, but I seriously think when the six months is over, I'm going to just cancel the TV.

1052
01:24:20,867 --> 01:24:22,028
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't ever watch it.

1053
01:24:22,648 --> 01:24:27,271
[SPEAKER_03]: He watched Casino Royale today for a couple minutes while I was getting ready for the show tonight.

1054
01:24:27,312 --> 01:24:29,873
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the most TV we've watched at all.

1055
01:24:30,013 --> 01:24:31,494
[SPEAKER_09]: We do nothing but watch Hulu now.

1056
01:24:31,574 --> 01:24:32,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I watch Drag Race online.

1057
01:24:33,015 --> 01:24:34,036
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only show I watch.

1058
01:24:34,456 --> 01:24:40,480
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll watch a DVD or something, but really almost anything you can just find online and network.

1059
01:24:43,002 --> 01:24:43,282
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1060
01:24:45,224 --> 01:24:45,784
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that, Mystique?

1061
01:24:45,804 --> 01:24:46,825
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta say that on the mic.

1062
01:24:47,425 --> 01:24:48,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody say hi to Mystique.

1063
01:24:48,446 --> 01:24:52,149
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't watched Transformy, but I have seen Untucked.

1064
01:24:59,139 --> 01:25:03,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Link, were they Undo Plastic Surgery or something?

1065
01:25:03,402 --> 01:25:11,349
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, Untucked is like the behind the scenes at RuPaul's Drag Race and you can really see who is nice and who is naughty.

1066
01:25:11,369 --> 01:25:14,631
[SPEAKER_03]: And did you know one of my favorite drag queens this season was Mystique?

1067
01:25:15,231 --> 01:25:16,793
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, isn't it awesome?

1068
01:25:16,853 --> 01:25:18,414
[SPEAKER_07]: I was a drag queen, I was so excited.

1069
01:25:18,434 --> 01:25:22,717
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, oh my god, my name is awesome because I'm a drag queen.

1070
01:25:23,338 --> 01:25:24,158
[SPEAKER_09]: And a porn star.

1071
01:25:24,519 --> 01:25:25,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly, I have arrived.

1072
01:25:26,932 --> 01:25:30,914
[SPEAKER_09]: How many people can say they have a name in common with a porn star and a drag queen?

1073
01:25:31,634 --> 01:25:32,334
[SPEAKER_03]: And a car.

1074
01:25:32,475 --> 01:25:34,375
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm changing my name to Pandora Box.

1075
01:25:34,415 --> 01:25:34,776
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1076
01:25:34,816 --> 01:25:36,316
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm going to have to do.

1077
01:25:38,217 --> 01:25:39,618
[SPEAKER_09]: So, moving forward.

1078
01:25:43,259 --> 01:25:46,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Bet you didn't know when you subscribed to this show on iTunes you'd be getting drag queen chat.

1079
01:25:46,941 --> 01:25:50,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone just wait until I put up the pictures of Rob and Frank here.

1080
01:25:50,783 --> 01:25:51,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you.

1081
01:25:51,443 --> 01:25:51,963
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you.

1082
01:25:52,684 --> 01:25:55,445
[SPEAKER_09]: You do look good in a corset and lingerie.

1083
01:25:56,198 --> 01:26:05,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they'll find out at PAX East But here's the thing Seriously, if they can do a Project Runway video game on the Wii Why can't they do a RuPaul's Drag Race video game on the Wii?

1084
01:26:06,562 --> 01:26:07,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

1085
01:26:07,202 --> 01:26:22,747
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be amazing Because you would have RuPaul on your TV going, you know And may the best woman win And don't F it up And don't beep it up Alright

1086
01:26:26,323 --> 01:26:30,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I want my own drag queen, that's why I would like to collect drag queens for myself

1087
01:26:50,863 --> 01:26:53,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta primp them all.

1088
01:26:53,725 --> 01:26:54,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta primp them all.

1089
01:26:54,646 --> 01:26:55,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, gotta catch them all.

1090
01:26:56,207 --> 01:26:57,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Pokey Queen, alright.

1091
01:26:59,210 --> 01:27:02,453
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, instead of, what was it, Nito, can you be Nito Queen?

1092
01:27:04,778 --> 01:27:06,159
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura goes in the vault and...

1093
01:27:32,697 --> 01:27:33,137
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1094
01:27:59,454 --> 01:27:59,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Why, thank you.

1095
01:28:02,815 --> 01:28:04,416
[SPEAKER_09]: This was a game, actually, in Japan.

1096
01:28:04,496 --> 01:28:06,336
[SPEAKER_09]: It was called Berserk Millennium Falcon.

1097
01:28:06,356 --> 01:28:09,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Which was based off of... Actually, you should hear...

1098
01:28:14,224 --> 01:28:15,446
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but I've seen a nice bush.

1099
01:28:15,706 --> 01:28:20,453
[SPEAKER_09]: But you should hear, the voice actor for Gutsu in this was Michael Bell.

1100
01:28:20,513 --> 01:28:24,859
[SPEAKER_01]: Did a lot of Transformers, Voltron.

1101
01:28:24,899 --> 01:28:29,766
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the English dub, which is kind of... Listen to this.

1102
01:28:32,051 --> 01:28:33,032
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a Mandragora.

1103
01:28:34,313 --> 01:28:35,734
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the American voice acting, though.

1104
01:28:36,274 --> 01:28:41,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you know who they got to do Casca's voice was BJ Ward, who was Princess Allura on Voltron.

1105
01:28:42,198 --> 01:28:44,920
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, these are voices that I know from my youth.

1106
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:46,701
[SPEAKER_09]: So this game was like, that's so cool.

1107
01:28:46,762 --> 01:28:50,264
[SPEAKER_09]: And also my favorite Japanese voice actor was Gatsu's voice in Japanese version.

1108
01:28:50,344 --> 01:28:51,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this like a Silent Hill kind of game?

1109
01:28:51,865 --> 01:28:52,185
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1110
01:28:52,366 --> 01:28:52,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1111
01:28:53,987 --> 01:28:56,509
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me get back to what I was telling you.

1112
01:28:56,810 --> 01:29:01,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Berserk is a dark fantasy manga in Japan.

1113
01:29:02,275 --> 01:29:03,296
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very graphic.

1114
01:29:04,497 --> 01:29:05,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Very graphic.

1115
01:29:06,904 --> 01:29:11,528
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1116
01:29:25,541 --> 01:29:28,182
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway, it's based off of a manga.

1117
01:29:30,423 --> 01:29:34,946
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's set, for anyone who is a fan of Berserk, I've read a whole bunch of the manga.

1118
01:29:35,366 --> 01:29:38,107
[SPEAKER_09]: It's set between volume 22 and 23 of the manga.

1119
01:29:38,567 --> 01:29:40,248
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's set after the anime series.

1120
01:29:41,269 --> 01:29:43,950
[SPEAKER_09]: The anime was, I think, a 26 episode series.

1121
01:29:45,691 --> 01:29:51,454
[SPEAKER_09]: And the anime followed the first arc of the manga, which was the whole Takanodon thing.

1122
01:29:52,035 --> 01:29:54,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody in chat by the way is saying Dark is an understatement.

1123
01:29:54,966 --> 01:29:56,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Dark is totally an understatement.

1124
01:29:57,475 --> 01:29:57,916
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like...

1125
01:30:00,766 --> 01:30:03,708
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes Tarantino movies look like Cartoon Network.

1126
01:30:03,768 --> 01:30:09,470
[SPEAKER_09]: There's like this whole scene in the manga where they go into this cave and there is like an orgy of the thousands.

1127
01:30:10,231 --> 01:30:12,432
[SPEAKER_09]: No, a graphic orgy of the thousands.

1128
01:30:12,552 --> 01:30:14,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool, blood orgy.

1129
01:30:14,293 --> 01:30:19,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and then when they get to the place where they're doing the Inquisition and we're talking about old school torture devices.

1130
01:30:19,915 --> 01:30:20,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty vicious.

1131
01:30:20,556 --> 01:30:21,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a Spanish Inquisition?

1132
01:30:22,397 --> 01:30:26,879
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes the Spanish Inquisition look like a puppet show.

1133
01:30:29,284 --> 01:30:32,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Misty's back there going, nobody expects a Spanish Inquisition!

1134
01:30:33,329 --> 01:30:36,092
[SPEAKER_03]: What in the hell did... Where did my show go?

1135
01:30:36,172 --> 01:30:37,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Has anyone seen it?

1136
01:30:37,314 --> 01:30:38,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it under the chair?

1137
01:30:38,475 --> 01:30:40,718
[SPEAKER_09]: That's because Misty walked into the room and she derails everything.

1138
01:30:42,591 --> 01:30:44,492
[SPEAKER_09]: But this particular one was on the Dreamcast.

1139
01:30:44,692 --> 01:30:49,295
[SPEAKER_09]: There's another one that came out on PS2, but I don't count it because, really, I like the Japanese one.

1140
01:30:49,655 --> 01:30:50,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the Dreamcast one.

1141
01:30:51,436 --> 01:30:53,157
[SPEAKER_09]: I do have the Japanese version of this game.

1142
01:30:53,938 --> 01:30:55,599
[SPEAKER_09]: And I got it just for the voice acting.

1143
01:30:56,479 --> 01:31:01,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they got the same people from the anime.

1144
01:31:02,063 --> 01:31:06,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, Hayashi Nobutoshi does Gatsu's voice, and same everybody.

1145
01:31:06,745 --> 01:31:09,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Except for, of course, all the ones who died violently at the end of the series.

1146
01:31:12,298 --> 01:31:18,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Shaoran in our chatroom says, Everyone dies, the world ends, and people burn in hell forever is a happy ending compared to Berserk.

1147
01:31:19,246 --> 01:31:19,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, pretty much.

1148
01:31:20,607 --> 01:31:21,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, okay.

1149
01:31:22,369 --> 01:31:29,717
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to give the background, and if you haven't seen the anime, spoiler, turn off your station for a little bit, or fast forward or whatever.

1150
01:31:31,388 --> 01:31:32,869
[SPEAKER_09]: The whole thing starts off with Gatsu as a boy.

1151
01:31:33,769 --> 01:31:43,633
[SPEAKER_09]: And he goes off and joins a mercenary group and he meets this chick named Casca who is the second in command under this guy named Griffith who is totally pretty and has this weird egg that he wears.

1152
01:31:43,673 --> 01:31:47,515
[SPEAKER_09]: It has two eyes, a nose, and a mouth but all spread in different areas.

1153
01:31:47,575 --> 01:31:48,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, stuff goes on.

1154
01:31:48,895 --> 01:31:52,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Griffith turns out to be the next in line to be, well, an evil god.

1155
01:31:53,477 --> 01:31:58,099
[SPEAKER_09]: And sacrifices the entire group in this big bloody feast.

1156
01:32:00,061 --> 01:32:00,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

1157
01:32:00,682 --> 01:32:02,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Blood Feast!

1158
01:32:02,926 --> 01:32:12,342
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to go into it, but as the manga starts continuing from there, Gatsu and Kasuka have a mark on them that means they're followed by demons because they were intended to be part of the sacrifice, but they escaped.

1159
01:32:12,782 --> 01:32:15,845
[SPEAKER_03]: There are similarities between that and Final Fantasy XIII, I just want to say.

1160
01:32:16,526 --> 01:32:17,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no.

1161
01:32:17,406 --> 01:32:17,667
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1162
01:32:17,947 --> 01:32:18,547
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing.

1163
01:32:19,548 --> 01:32:19,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing.

1164
01:32:20,910 --> 01:32:24,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is a bummer because I wish Vanille was in the game Jamie's talking about.

1165
01:32:24,453 --> 01:32:26,194
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only bummer.

1166
01:32:26,375 --> 01:32:26,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I finish?

1167
01:32:26,975 --> 01:32:27,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you can finish.

1168
01:32:28,477 --> 01:32:34,862
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway, this is a side story, but from what I understand, it is considered part of the canon.

1169
01:32:35,903 --> 01:32:36,284
[SPEAKER_09]: And so...

1170
01:32:38,277 --> 01:32:47,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Gatsu, somewhere in the manga, this little elf starts following Gatsu around called Puck, who's really more like a weird little chubby fairy with blue hair.

1171
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:50,080
[SPEAKER_09]: What'd you call me?

1172
01:32:51,660 --> 01:32:52,520
[SPEAKER_09]: A blue chubby fairy.

1173
01:32:53,500 --> 01:33:00,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, the whole point is that Casca, from her ordeal, because she had a bad time,

1174
01:33:00,902 --> 01:33:02,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds like Vone.

1175
01:33:28,022 --> 01:33:36,584
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway, it's them getting all caught up in this one thing because the main bad guy, his wife, has the same problem that Casper does, but it's a long story.

1176
01:33:37,184 --> 01:33:37,864
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not getting onto it.

1177
01:33:37,985 --> 01:33:39,225
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really a game worth playing.

1178
01:33:39,245 --> 01:33:40,405
[SPEAKER_09]: It really is a game worth playing.

1179
01:33:40,445 --> 01:33:41,085
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really fun.

1180
01:33:42,646 --> 01:33:48,407
[SPEAKER_09]: So, of course, it ends gruesome, just like anything related to Berserk ends.

1181
01:33:52,088 --> 01:33:54,729
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's just really, really a fun game.

1182
01:33:55,029 --> 01:33:55,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

1183
01:33:56,943 --> 01:34:03,191
[SPEAKER_09]: And like I said, there was another version that came out on PlayStation 2.

1184
01:34:06,415 --> 01:34:07,577
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also the soundtrack.

1185
01:34:07,597 --> 01:34:11,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, what's really cool about this is... Let me hear the music for a second.

1186
01:34:15,618 --> 01:34:17,159
[SPEAKER_09]: You can find one on there that's Forces 2.

1187
01:34:18,239 --> 01:34:28,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Forces was the opening theme song to the anime and the guy who did the soundtrack for the anime and the opening theme and everything did all the music in the game.

1188
01:34:29,163 --> 01:34:31,244
[SPEAKER_09]: And he did a special version of the opening song.

1189
01:34:40,026 --> 01:34:43,291
[SPEAKER_09]: So he did a special version of the opening theme.

1190
01:34:43,972 --> 01:34:53,665
[SPEAKER_09]: So it really, this is actually, I think, one of the best tie-ins because you don't really have to, I mean, if you've been keeping up with the series, you don't really have to guess about where it's gone, where the specific...

1191
01:35:06,667 --> 01:35:11,369
[SPEAKER_09]: This is actually one of my favorite pieces of music ever.

1192
01:35:14,951 --> 01:35:15,271
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1193
01:35:18,793 --> 01:35:21,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody from the living room keeps coming in here to derail the show.

1194
01:35:21,815 --> 01:35:24,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan is just waving chicken around.

1195
01:35:24,316 --> 01:35:26,157
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan, tell everyone how awesome this game is.

1196
01:35:27,045 --> 01:35:27,365
[SPEAKER_03]: He left.

1197
01:35:27,745 --> 01:35:28,066
[SPEAKER_03]: He left.

1198
01:35:28,106 --> 01:35:28,646
[SPEAKER_03]: He had chicken.

1199
01:35:28,926 --> 01:35:29,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Butthead!

1200
01:35:30,687 --> 01:35:31,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Berserk.

1201
01:35:31,748 --> 01:35:32,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Chicken.

1202
01:35:35,790 --> 01:35:36,671
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm disowning you.

1203
01:35:37,311 --> 01:35:40,853
[SPEAKER_03]: PETA would tell you that what happens to chickens is something like this Berserk game.

1204
01:35:41,734 --> 01:35:42,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1205
01:35:43,935 --> 01:35:46,797
[SPEAKER_09]: But, at any rate, oh, here he is.

1206
01:35:46,917 --> 01:35:48,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Next time you have a Chicken McNugget, just think of Berserk.

1207
01:35:48,398 --> 01:35:52,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie always gets mad at me because I go to the store, I buy lunch meat, and I don't buy what she likes.

1208
01:35:53,621 --> 01:35:55,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this time I want... What the fuck?

1209
01:35:55,702 --> 01:35:56,523
[SPEAKER_06]: What the fuck?

1210
01:35:57,591 --> 01:35:58,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Bitch, you are eating that chicken.

1211
01:36:00,355 --> 01:36:01,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Or I'll give it to Eric.

1212
01:36:02,738 --> 01:36:03,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Joker.

1213
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:04,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes!

1214
01:36:06,943 --> 01:36:07,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Berserk.

1215
01:36:07,885 --> 01:36:09,687
[SPEAKER_06]: We do a show here, it's about video games.

1216
01:36:10,168 --> 01:36:11,870
[SPEAKER_06]: The one that was on Dreamcast?

1217
01:36:11,910 --> 01:36:13,312
[SPEAKER_06]: That game was hard as nails.

1218
01:36:15,290 --> 01:36:22,576
[SPEAKER_06]: It was, like, you get to Nosferatu Zod, and he's like, by the way, I know you thought you were good at 3D action games, but you suck.

1219
01:36:23,257 --> 01:36:28,001
[SPEAKER_06]: And he'll kill you, and kill you, and kill you, and kill you, until you finally man up enough to beat him.

1220
01:36:28,501 --> 01:36:30,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Then the rest of the game is fucking harder than hell.

1221
01:36:32,685 --> 01:36:32,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1222
01:36:33,785 --> 01:36:34,966
[SPEAKER_06]: And the story's a little bit dark?

1223
01:36:35,927 --> 01:36:37,629
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, Berserk's all bright and airy.

1224
01:36:38,930 --> 01:36:39,951
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very similar to the Unicorn game.

1225
01:36:39,971 --> 01:36:42,152
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's a story of rape and insanity.

1226
01:36:44,065 --> 01:36:45,326
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just the backstory.

1227
01:36:45,346 --> 01:36:48,728
[SPEAKER_03]: See, if they had called the game Rape and Insanity, it would have sold more.

1228
01:36:48,788 --> 01:36:51,550
[SPEAKER_03]: But Berserk, everybody thinks that's a game with a bouncing happy face.

1229
01:36:51,911 --> 01:36:52,171
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

1230
01:36:52,191 --> 01:36:52,811
[SPEAKER_06]: In an electric maze.

1231
01:36:52,931 --> 01:36:53,972
[SPEAKER_06]: It's spelled differently.

1232
01:36:54,973 --> 01:36:56,394
[SPEAKER_06]: That's spelled with a Z. Oh, okay.

1233
01:36:56,614 --> 01:36:57,294
[SPEAKER_06]: And it has evil auto.

1234
01:36:57,454 --> 01:36:59,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, hard as nails.

1235
01:37:00,837 --> 01:37:01,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else?

1236
01:37:02,618 --> 01:37:02,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Chicken.

1237
01:37:03,218 --> 01:37:03,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Chicken.

1238
01:37:07,367 --> 01:37:08,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan was actually right.

1239
01:37:08,227 --> 01:37:09,688
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty much how the series ends.

1240
01:37:12,069 --> 01:37:13,510
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a Laserdisc.

1241
01:37:14,470 --> 01:37:15,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I liked Berserk.

1242
01:37:16,251 --> 01:37:16,811
[SPEAKER_09]: That's very cool.

1243
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:24,114
[SPEAKER_09]: You have your Mr. J. Anyway, Berserk was a series that I was so into.

1244
01:37:24,854 --> 01:37:26,515
[SPEAKER_09]: I loved the anime.

1245
01:37:27,396 --> 01:37:28,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Piss off!

1246
01:37:30,459 --> 01:37:32,240
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize to the listeners.

1247
01:37:32,440 --> 01:37:34,601
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just insanity going on in the studio tonight.

1248
01:37:36,082 --> 01:37:40,724
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like our show has the red ring of death tonight because it's the 360th episode.

1249
01:37:40,784 --> 01:37:42,124
[SPEAKER_03]: So congratulations.

1250
01:37:42,564 --> 01:37:44,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan, you broke the show tonight.

1251
01:37:45,866 --> 01:37:46,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Five gamerscore.

1252
01:37:47,547 --> 01:37:50,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, well I got your chicken right here.

1253
01:37:53,225 --> 01:37:54,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan goes, no, it's in the fridge.

1254
01:37:55,307 --> 01:38:03,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, yeah, when Dan says that the backstory for this game is rape and insanity, he means that literally.

1255
01:38:04,194 --> 01:38:06,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, that's how the TV series ends.

1256
01:38:06,636 --> 01:38:07,737
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why Costco's fucked up.

1257
01:38:08,778 --> 01:38:19,066
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was a really, you know what, I have to say, I was surprised that the game came over here because the anime hadn't been out over here

1258
01:38:19,386 --> 01:38:20,867
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1259
01:38:44,145 --> 01:38:50,249
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I watched some of the anime and decided to get the Japanese version because I really love dude's voice.

1260
01:38:50,890 --> 01:38:53,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Hayashi Nobutoshi is like my favorite voice actor ever.

1261
01:38:53,612 --> 01:38:56,814
[SPEAKER_09]: For anyone who watched Fushigi Yugi, he did Toski's voice acting.

1262
01:38:57,595 --> 01:38:59,896
[SPEAKER_09]: And Basara in Macross 7.

1263
01:39:00,356 --> 01:39:02,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Not the singing, although he's got an amazing singing voice.

1264
01:39:03,499 --> 01:39:05,520
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's examples.

1265
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:12,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and he also was... Who was the dude in Pokemon who had the Earth-based... Brock?

1266
01:39:12,305 --> 01:39:12,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1267
01:39:12,485 --> 01:39:12,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1268
01:39:14,124 --> 01:39:14,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Sano's voice was him.

1269
01:39:22,522 --> 01:39:24,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Sanosuke in Rurouni Kitchen.

1270
01:39:24,924 --> 01:39:25,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, I'm sorry.

1271
01:39:25,605 --> 01:39:26,765
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm getting my voice actors mixed up.

1272
01:39:26,786 --> 01:39:27,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1273
01:39:27,586 --> 01:39:27,986
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah.

1274
01:39:29,167 --> 01:39:29,928
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1275
01:39:29,968 --> 01:39:30,468
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm wired.

1276
01:39:30,869 --> 01:39:31,709
[SPEAKER_09]: You gave me chocolate.

1277
01:39:31,749 --> 01:39:31,969
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm wired.

1278
01:39:31,989 --> 01:39:32,470
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's okay.

1279
01:39:33,030 --> 01:39:34,972
[SPEAKER_03]: This classic game of the Wii game has been going on for 20 minutes.

1280
01:39:35,052 --> 01:39:37,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything else you want to say about the classic game?

1281
01:39:37,514 --> 01:39:39,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Play the damn game.

1282
01:39:39,695 --> 01:39:41,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Or she will talk more about it.

1283
01:39:41,377 --> 01:39:46,420
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do warn you, if you have any kind of traumatic memories, never read the manga.

1284
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:46,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1285
01:39:47,421 --> 01:39:47,981
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

1286
01:40:16,205 --> 01:40:17,726
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't count Sega.

1287
01:40:17,786 --> 01:40:20,007
[SPEAKER_09]: It counts Dreamcast.

1288
01:40:21,347 --> 01:40:22,428
[SPEAKER_09]: I have done a lot of Sega games.

1289
01:40:23,328 --> 01:40:23,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Sega!

1290
01:40:24,269 --> 01:40:26,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we do a break now?

1291
01:40:26,409 --> 01:40:27,030
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

1292
01:40:27,050 --> 01:40:28,110
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to break stuff.

1293
01:40:28,130 --> 01:40:28,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Chicken!

1294
01:40:32,893 --> 01:40:33,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Help.

1295
01:40:34,394 --> 01:40:36,175
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're in the Sacramento area, please send help.

1296
01:40:36,415 --> 01:40:38,916
[SPEAKER_03]: We're located at Jamie's house, Studio DarkSakura.

1297
01:40:38,956 --> 01:40:39,797
[SPEAKER_03]: The address is... No.

1298
01:40:40,517 --> 01:40:43,479
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go to our break here, but don't go anywhere.

1299
01:40:43,539 --> 01:40:45,160
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there's more to come.

[SPEAKER_03]: Part A was one hour and 45 minutes tonight.

1302
01:40:48,922 --> 01:40:50,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Will we surpass that with Part B?

1303
01:40:50,923 --> 01:40:51,543
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1304
01:40:51,943 --> 01:40:52,604
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll be here.

[SPEAKER_03]: And the topic tonight, I will tell you now, the topic tonight so you can be thinking about it.

1316
01:41:34,942 --> 01:41:37,524
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to do something Microsoft inspired since it's episode 360.

1317
01:41:38,084 --> 01:41:40,026
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is Microsoft really good at?

1318
01:41:40,666 --> 01:41:49,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Stealing other people's ideas and making them better So, tonight's list list is What great idea should Microsoft steal next?

1319
01:41:50,728 --> 01:42:07,331
[SPEAKER_03]: So, or the idea that Microsoft should steal and make better next So, we will get into list list, and if you don't know how that works, stay tuned Also, with tonight's list list, you will be able to place your votes And if you want, I have two blur beta codes, speaking of the 360, to give away to random voters

1322
01:42:15,094 --> 01:42:17,535
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, we have some rapid-fire news.

1323
01:42:17,595 --> 01:42:21,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I did want to say before we get into the news, sorry, I do want to mention PAX East is coming up this weekend.

1324
01:42:21,856 --> 01:42:26,118
[SPEAKER_03]: And I am going to PAX East, and I do not believe there is an OLR next week because of it.

1325
01:42:26,438 --> 01:42:28,859
[SPEAKER_09]: No, there's a NAPLR.

1326
01:42:30,474 --> 01:42:35,237
[SPEAKER_03]: There will not be a live show next week.

1327
01:42:35,378 --> 01:42:42,943
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I will be recording stuff, but it will only be posted to the Twitter and Facebook and our online communities.

1328
01:42:43,003 --> 01:42:44,644
[SPEAKER_03]: It will not go to the podcast feed.

1329
01:42:45,004 --> 01:42:46,085
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got to stay tuned.

1335
01:43:47,885 --> 01:43:49,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, now we're ready for some news.

1336
01:43:50,006 --> 01:43:51,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, let's do some rapid, quick, quick news.

1337
01:43:51,966 --> 01:44:01,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, so let's start off with the release date for Crackdown 2, which is now being put into one of the most dead months of the year, July.

1338
01:44:02,028 --> 01:44:05,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it'll be coming out July 6th, and boy, does it look awesome.

1339
01:44:06,689 --> 01:44:11,932
[SPEAKER_02]: The game will be releasing in North America on July 6th with Asia, Australia, and New Zealand following on July 8th.

1340
01:44:12,452 --> 01:44:14,373
[SPEAKER_02]: In Europe following on July 9th.

1341
01:44:14,573 --> 01:44:19,335
[SPEAKER_02]: No word on exactly when Japan will be receiving the game or any of the Asian regions.

1342
01:44:21,036 --> 01:44:22,737
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it looks all sorts of awesome.

1343
01:44:24,317 --> 01:44:36,366
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that was supposed to not be coming out over here apparently is Batman Arkham Asylum the game of the year edition will indeed be coming out over in North America and will also feature 3D support as well.

1344
01:44:37,147 --> 01:44:51,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Originally they announced that the 3D would be done in a way that wouldn't alter the colors however I see now in the picture that they have the kind of purple and green glasses so apparently it's just going to be the standard 3D stuff and

1345
01:44:52,097 --> 01:44:53,098
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1346
01:45:15,110 --> 01:45:22,574
[SPEAKER_02]: and a voucher for some unidentified movie download as well as an exclusive in-game item for Peace Walker.

1347
01:45:22,594 --> 01:45:25,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Could it possibly be Metal Gear or espionage related, the movie?

1348
01:45:25,696 --> 01:45:26,556
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just call it a hunch.

1349
01:45:27,957 --> 01:45:28,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1350
01:45:28,357 --> 01:45:28,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a guess.

1351
01:45:28,678 --> 01:45:28,998
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1352
01:45:29,398 --> 01:45:30,739
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have a Metal Gear movie.

1353
01:45:31,339 --> 01:45:33,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, it could be an anime or something right now.

1354
01:45:33,660 --> 01:45:34,521
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess there isn't one, is there?

1355
01:45:34,541 --> 01:45:35,241
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1356
01:45:35,261 --> 01:45:36,542
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll probably be something like James Bond.

1357
01:45:36,582 --> 01:45:38,003
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be Quantum of Solace or something.

1358
01:45:38,203 --> 01:45:39,363
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, something close.

1359
01:45:40,124 --> 01:45:40,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

1360
01:45:41,284 --> 01:45:43,185
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, of course, will be coming out for $200.

1361
01:45:43,265 --> 01:45:43,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1362
01:45:45,373 --> 01:45:47,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fight Double Impact Magic Sword

1363
01:46:06,457 --> 01:46:10,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it is coming April 14th and 15th, depending on which store you want.

1364
01:46:10,458 --> 01:46:13,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox Live gets it on the 14th, and PlayStation Store gets it the same way.

1365
01:46:13,259 --> 01:46:15,700
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm disappointed that Captain Commando is not part of that.

1366
01:46:16,300 --> 01:46:19,341
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but it's weird, because it's Final Fight and Magic Sword.

1367
01:46:19,381 --> 01:46:20,782
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't think of more different games.

1368
01:46:20,822 --> 01:46:22,062
[SPEAKER_03]: They're running on the same engine.

1369
01:46:22,122 --> 01:46:24,683
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, but they're still completely different games, Loki.

1370
01:46:24,743 --> 01:46:26,323
[SPEAKER_03]: They have nothing in common.

1371
01:46:26,543 --> 01:46:27,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's the same engine.

1372
01:46:27,804 --> 01:46:28,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, two games to the price of one.

1373
01:46:28,784 --> 01:46:29,604
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way I look at it.

1374
01:46:29,664 --> 01:46:30,225
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

1375
01:46:30,445 --> 01:46:30,965
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

1376
01:46:31,445 --> 01:46:32,147
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm looking forward to it.

1377
01:46:32,187 --> 01:46:40,141
[SPEAKER_03]: If not for nothing else, for me, it's Magic Sword featuring Final Fight because I hate how Magic Sword is being understated in this release.

1378
01:46:40,722 --> 01:46:41,163
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why.

1379
01:46:41,203 --> 01:46:41,704
[SPEAKER_03]: It bugs me.

1380
01:46:41,904 --> 01:46:42,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just weird.

1381
01:46:43,393 --> 01:46:44,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you like to buy my namesake?

1382
01:46:45,074 --> 01:46:45,554
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

1383
01:46:45,574 --> 01:46:47,116
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy an R.O.B.

1384
01:46:47,336 --> 01:46:47,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Robot.

1385
01:46:47,776 --> 01:46:51,098
[SPEAKER_03]: The Rob the Robot you can buy for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

1386
01:46:51,418 --> 01:46:52,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Except it will set you back only $4,150.

1387
01:46:52,739 --> 01:46:54,941
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

1388
01:46:55,001 --> 01:46:56,722
[SPEAKER_03]: It just sold on an eBay auction this week.

1389
01:46:56,802 --> 01:46:57,843
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the deal, guys.

1390
01:46:57,903 --> 01:46:59,464
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like pristine in a case.

1391
01:46:59,484 --> 01:47:02,146
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like one of those sales cases that they actually used to have in the store.

1392
01:47:02,266 --> 01:47:02,866
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember those.

1393
01:47:03,086 --> 01:47:04,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I remember those too.

1394
01:47:04,107 --> 01:47:09,711
[SPEAKER_03]: So somebody actually bought that with the Nintendo System, the controllers, the gun, all that stuff.

1395
01:47:09,731 --> 01:47:09,711
$4,150.

1396
01:47:09,831 --> 01:47:13,093
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if they remembered, but it wasn't that good.

1397
01:47:13,733 --> 01:47:16,836
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you ever actually played the Rob the Robot, but it was kind of annoying.

1398
01:47:16,856 --> 01:47:20,040
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to get one for my desk, and trust me, they're a lot cheaper than $4,000.

1399
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:22,883
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you could get them way cheaper.

1400
01:47:22,903 --> 01:47:24,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, these are in pristine condition.

1401
01:47:24,224 --> 01:47:26,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, who cares?

1402
01:47:26,386 --> 01:47:33,894
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta say, in the display box and everything's pretty cool, but it's weird to think that that was sitting in some store that probably got sent it for free.

1403
01:47:33,934 --> 01:47:34,174
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah...

1404
01:47:34,654 --> 01:47:37,198
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've never played the Rob the Robot before, it was really weird.

1405
01:47:37,238 --> 01:47:48,875
[SPEAKER_03]: It had these little gyro things that would spin, and then you would have to move them onto a thing that would push down the button on your controller, but then they would start to lose speed, so you'd have to pick them up and rev them up again.

1406
01:47:48,895 --> 01:47:49,817
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of annoying.

1407
01:47:50,512 --> 01:47:57,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the NES that I got was, I think I got a NES when I was little within the first month of it coming out, so I got the ROB system.

1408
01:47:58,299 --> 01:48:00,361
[SPEAKER_04]: It really wasn't fun at all, and it was loud.

1409
01:48:01,062 --> 01:48:04,205
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so loud, the sound of it, you know, spinning up the things.

1410
01:48:04,505 --> 01:48:07,468
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend had one of these, and I remember we tried to play it once, and it was a little ridiculous.

1411
01:48:07,608 --> 01:48:07,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1412
01:48:08,068 --> 01:48:08,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1413
01:48:09,049 --> 01:48:10,209
[SPEAKER_03]: So, not worth $41.50?

1414
01:48:10,330 --> 01:48:10,610
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1415
01:48:10,630 --> 01:48:11,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1416
01:48:12,870 --> 01:48:14,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, and one other story for you guys.

1417
01:48:15,031 --> 01:48:20,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Pac-Man Battle Royale, we talked about it a couple weeks on the show, saying it had the worst teaser trailer ever because it didn't say anything about the game.

1418
01:48:21,213 --> 01:48:23,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we finally know some things about the game.

1419
01:48:23,654 --> 01:48:30,376
[SPEAKER_03]: A video has hit the internet from the Amusement Expo that finally shows a little bit about what we can see in this game.

1420
01:48:30,456 --> 01:48:32,237
[SPEAKER_03]: And we see some folks playing the game in this video.

1421
01:48:32,837 --> 01:48:41,484
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically it looks like a little bit of a mixture between Pac-Man Championship Edition, it kind of has those little graphics, and a little bit of Pac-Man Versus elements.

1422
01:48:41,784 --> 01:48:42,665
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the deal.

1423
01:48:43,425 --> 01:48:47,409
[SPEAKER_03]: In Pac-Man Versus, the other players are playing as ghosts, but that's not what's happening here.

1424
01:48:47,949 --> 01:48:50,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody is playing as different Pac-Mans.

1425
01:48:50,751 --> 01:48:54,674
[SPEAKER_03]: But Pac-Man can eat the other Pac-Mans with a specific power-up.

1426
01:48:55,115 --> 01:48:58,998
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's the coolest part of all, it's a cocktail cabinet.

1427
01:48:59,298 --> 01:49:00,158
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a table.

1428
01:49:01,139 --> 01:49:02,460
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the cabinet they're playing it on.

1429
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:03,440
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those old cocktail cabinets.

1430
01:49:03,460 --> 01:49:04,760
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what the lamest part about it is?

1431
01:49:04,860 --> 01:49:05,000
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1432
01:49:05,021 --> 01:49:06,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Eating the dots doesn't give you any points.

1433
01:49:06,701 --> 01:49:10,062
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no points in the game other than eating the other players or being the last one to survive.

1434
01:49:10,102 --> 01:49:13,203
[SPEAKER_03]: I would imagine eating the dots is how you power up.

1435
01:49:13,964 --> 01:49:19,466
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically how you... Eating the dots is basically how you trigger more dots to appear and more power-ups to appear.

1436
01:49:19,766 --> 01:49:21,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you grow like Super Pac-Man?

1437
01:49:21,306 --> 01:49:21,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you do.

1438
01:49:21,927 --> 01:49:22,627
[SPEAKER_09]: That is beautiful.

1439
01:49:23,027 --> 01:49:25,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Pac-Man Pac-Man Pac-Man Pac-Man Pac-Man

1440
01:49:51,324 --> 01:49:54,828
[SPEAKER_09]: If Pac-Man is his species, then Pac-Man would be proper.

1441
01:49:56,030 --> 01:49:56,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Just checking.

1442
01:49:57,471 --> 01:49:58,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, don't care.

1443
01:49:58,652 --> 01:50:00,254
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

1444
01:50:00,635 --> 01:50:00,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

1445
01:50:02,837 --> 01:50:03,678
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, bite me.

1446
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:06,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well...

1447
01:50:09,528 --> 01:50:14,031
[SPEAKER_09]: For our friends in the UK and in Germany, and trust me, I tried.

1448
01:50:15,192 --> 01:50:26,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Telltale is going to be giving out free copies of the Strong Bad... The Strong Bad's cool game for attractive people on Wii.

1449
01:50:26,258 --> 01:50:30,601
[SPEAKER_09]: You're getting Episode 2, Strong Baddie of the Free, and that will be your prize.

1450
01:50:31,381 --> 01:50:35,684
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's only about 300 copies, and this has already been going on.

1451
01:50:36,284 --> 01:50:37,986
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you want to...

1452
01:50:39,727 --> 01:50:41,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Do the survey.

1453
01:50:41,648 --> 01:50:49,732
[SPEAKER_09]: It's at surveymonkey.com slash S slash, and this is all capitals, L-H-R-S-C-X-J.

1454
01:50:50,272 --> 01:50:52,313
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm going to post it in the chat room so that they can do it first.

1455
01:50:52,853 --> 01:50:53,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1456
01:50:53,254 --> 01:50:55,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you get a special prize for listening to us live.

1457
01:50:57,156 --> 01:50:59,257
[SPEAKER_09]: And Rob, do you want to post it on Twitter too?

1458
01:50:59,656 --> 01:50:59,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh well.

1459
01:51:00,057 --> 01:51:00,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh well.

1460
01:51:15,276 --> 01:51:21,404
[SPEAKER_09]: And for Rock Band, who the heck cares about any of these people?

1461
01:51:21,624 --> 01:51:23,386
[SPEAKER_09]: X-Pack, number one.

1462
01:51:23,827 --> 01:51:25,809
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Rock Band download content.

1463
01:51:26,350 --> 01:51:32,999
[SPEAKER_09]: There's Blue Spark, The Hungry Wolf, I Must Not Think Bad Thoughts, and Los Angeles.

1464
01:51:33,450 --> 01:51:36,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd take Hungry Like the Wolf, but that's not this.

1465
01:51:36,632 --> 01:51:37,733
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll take Kick Your Butt.

1466
01:51:39,194 --> 01:51:44,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Individual tracks is Little Fish, Am I Crazy, Big Bang, and Darling Deer.

1467
01:51:45,198 --> 01:51:49,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Ace Frehley, wasn't that the guitarist for Kiss?

1468
01:51:50,162 --> 01:51:51,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Ace Frehley was the guitarist for Kiss.

1469
01:51:51,523 --> 01:51:53,904
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't know he was doing stuff on his own anymore.

1470
01:51:54,585 --> 01:51:59,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Outer Space, Carrie Underwood, All-American Girl, Snore, One Republic, Stop and Stare.

1471
01:52:00,089 --> 01:52:01,890
[SPEAKER_09]: It's also, of course, available for Lego Rock Band.

1472
01:52:02,230 --> 01:52:02,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Ryan Tedder.

1473
01:52:05,009 --> 01:52:07,812
[SPEAKER_09]: and 32X Anniversary!

1474
01:52:08,372 --> 01:52:09,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

1475
01:52:11,796 --> 01:52:20,406
[SPEAKER_09]: There is the 32X Anniversary album Sega is going to be putting out that will have all of the tracks released.

1476
01:52:20,566 --> 01:52:27,869
[SPEAKER_09]: from Space Harrier, Stellar Assault, Virtua Racing Deluxe, oh lord, Parasquad, Metalhead, and Virtua Fighter.

1477
01:52:28,389 --> 01:52:30,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly the way they were on the 32X.

1478
01:52:30,630 --> 01:52:39,314
[SPEAKER_09]: And it will be released through Wave Master, Sega's label, on March 31st for 3,625 yen, about 40 bucks.

1479
01:52:42,055 --> 01:52:45,377
[SPEAKER_09]: But you can just get 32X in all the games for a lot less than that.

1480
01:52:46,117 --> 01:52:47,038
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a 32X.

1481
01:52:47,958 --> 01:52:49,879
[SPEAKER_09]: The Great Space Mushroom.

1482
01:52:51,463 --> 01:52:53,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is there no Calibri soundtrack on here?

1483
01:52:54,284 --> 01:52:54,604
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1484
01:52:54,824 --> 01:52:56,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's like a hidden track.

1485
01:52:56,044 --> 01:52:56,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's a hidden track.

1486
01:52:56,605 --> 01:52:59,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is there no Knuckles Chaotix on here?

1487
01:52:59,566 --> 01:52:59,906
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1488
01:53:00,386 --> 01:53:00,986
[SPEAKER_09]: That game was cool.

1489
01:53:01,186 --> 01:53:03,127
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1490
01:53:03,287 --> 01:53:06,948
[SPEAKER_09]: However, I do love Space Harrier on 32X because it is the arcade version.

1491
01:53:08,359 --> 01:53:09,099
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1492
01:53:26,730 --> 01:53:27,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1493
01:53:47,202 --> 01:53:54,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, but first some Twitter topics, and I was not a good host tonight and forgot to remind people to post their Twitter topics, but that's okay.

1494
01:53:55,605 --> 01:54:02,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't want the segment to be that long tonight because we have Listless tonight, and now we have an interview in Part B, so yeah, we got to hurry, hurry.

1495
01:54:03,277 --> 01:54:14,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's see, starting off with TigerClaw305, linking us to a story about how McDonald's uses the DS to train part-time workers.

1496
01:54:15,026 --> 01:54:16,748
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a DS-based training.

1497
01:54:17,128 --> 01:54:22,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, keep in mind, this isn't something that's happening in America, but it's something that's working with McDonald's Japan.

1498
01:54:22,492 --> 01:54:26,513
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually use the DS as a training tool using a training program called eSmart.

1499
01:54:26,993 --> 01:54:29,714
[SPEAKER_03]: So a part-time employee will train through the software.

1500
01:54:30,714 --> 01:54:33,335
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be used in 3,700 stores all around Japan.

1501
01:54:34,135 --> 01:54:36,956
[SPEAKER_03]: And the program's cost is about 200 million yen.

1502
01:54:37,096 --> 01:54:40,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that somebody actually has to pay that, but that's how much it costs to develop and everything.

1503
01:54:40,797 --> 01:54:44,318
[SPEAKER_03]: McDonald's thinks it can cut the training time by over half.

1504
01:54:45,258 --> 01:54:52,420
[SPEAKER_03]: by using this new system because lots of people already know how to use the DS and they want to get employees quickly out on the floor.

1505
01:54:52,900 --> 01:54:53,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of interesting.

1506
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:57,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to admit, my day job, if you didn't know, has to do with training.

1507
01:54:57,881 --> 01:54:59,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I train for a big corporation.

1508
01:54:59,741 --> 01:55:03,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Not McDonald's, but a different corporation.

1509
01:55:04,122 --> 01:55:06,082
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always interested in these types of new training tools.

1510
01:55:08,283 --> 01:55:14,444
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess if you can make sure that employees are comprehending the information given and it's a fun, interactive way to learn...

1511
01:55:14,724 --> 01:55:14,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue Swim

1512
01:55:26,786 --> 01:55:32,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitter question, did you guys take advantage of Kmart's $10 off $20 plus coupon overnight?

1513
01:55:32,909 --> 01:55:39,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, there was an online coupon for its NYC stores that wasn't region locked, allowing people everywhere to use it.

1514
01:55:40,072 --> 01:55:44,854
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I hadn't heard and it would be really hard to get me to set foot in a Kmart anyway.

1515
01:55:45,649 --> 01:55:46,650
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it came right around the corner.

1516
01:55:46,790 --> 01:55:49,772
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, free money is a pretty good way to do it, I gotta say.

1517
01:55:50,032 --> 01:55:51,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops.

1518
01:55:52,894 --> 01:55:54,935
[SPEAKER_03]: We started to have mailbag music play in the background there.

1519
01:55:54,955 --> 01:55:55,456
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want that.

1520
01:55:56,817 --> 01:56:06,803
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100Matt is linking us to a story about an Apple-related incident where Apple apparently banned a game developer because he called the store awful and horrible.

1521
01:56:07,664 --> 01:56:14,549
[SPEAKER_03]: The developer's name was Tommy Refens and Apple removed his app Zits and Giggles.

1522
01:56:15,249 --> 01:56:18,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, for starters, that just needed to be removed, but whatever.

1523
01:56:19,653 --> 01:56:27,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, the creator was at Game Developers Conference, and he said that he absolutely fucking hates the iPhone App Store.

1524
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:35,085
[SPEAKER_03]: He said that the iPhone gaming market is like the Tiger handheld games of the 80s and 90s.

1525
01:56:35,505 --> 01:56:39,108
[SPEAKER_03]: You might remember those crappy little LCD games like Mr. Game & Watch-esque stuff.

1526
01:56:40,069 --> 01:56:40,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1527
01:56:40,689 --> 01:56:44,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, zits and giggles, this was the guy, this was the company, and I think we've talked about him on the store.

1528
01:56:45,373 --> 01:56:48,916
[SPEAKER_03]: They would keep raising the price of their game to see who would keep buying it.

1529
01:56:49,276 --> 01:56:50,817
[SPEAKER_03]: And they had raised it up to over $400.

1530
01:56:52,478 --> 01:56:56,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Apple, of course, didn't tell any reason why they took the game down.

1531
01:56:57,282 --> 01:56:58,963
[SPEAKER_03]: So, there you go.

1532
01:56:59,003 --> 01:57:01,305
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe it had to be with the fact that he was acting like a dick.

1533
01:57:02,466 --> 01:57:05,989
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you bite the hand that feeds you, they're probably going to cut you off.

1534
01:57:08,255 --> 01:57:12,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Ionotropic asks, Puzzle Quest 2, discuss the puzzle crack.

1535
01:57:13,037 --> 01:57:15,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Puzzle Quest 2 is not out yet, is it?

1536
01:57:15,397 --> 01:57:16,057
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not out yet.

1537
01:57:16,218 --> 01:57:16,818
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming out.

1538
01:57:17,478 --> 01:57:21,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan, I know you're a big Puzzle Quest fan, and you like the gyromancers and those types of games.

1539
01:57:21,459 --> 01:57:22,679
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you want in a Puzzle Quest 2?

1540
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:24,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything you're looking for?

1541
01:57:25,801 --> 01:57:29,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, just have it not be Galactrix, really.

1542
01:57:29,444 --> 01:57:30,746
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not Galactrix this time.

1543
01:57:30,986 --> 01:57:33,208
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they're going back to the old school puzzle quest.

1544
01:57:33,268 --> 01:57:35,309
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more ye olde, uh, bejeweling.

1545
01:57:35,530 --> 01:57:35,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1546
01:57:36,550 --> 01:57:36,911
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.

1547
01:57:36,931 --> 01:57:38,272
[SPEAKER_03]: You just want more of the same?

1548
01:57:38,352 --> 01:57:39,233
[SPEAKER_03]: No features you can think of?

1549
01:57:39,393 --> 01:57:40,534
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1550
01:57:40,554 --> 01:57:43,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they have, like, Peggle Quests or something like that, you know?

1551
01:57:44,797 --> 01:57:45,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Peggle Quest?

1552
01:57:45,498 --> 01:57:46,859
[SPEAKER_03]: I think DarkSakura would be all over that.

1553
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:49,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Peggle Knights with a K?

1554
01:57:50,442 --> 01:57:51,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Peggle Death.

1555
01:57:52,003 --> 01:57:52,283
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1556
01:57:52,943 --> 01:57:54,804
[SPEAKER_03]: And lastly, Actdeft links us to a story.

1557
01:57:54,904 --> 01:58:00,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Australia is closer to getting M-rated games, says the tweet that came to us at OLR.

1558
01:58:01,065 --> 01:58:04,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Linking us to this story about somebody, I guess, who is stepping down.

1559
01:58:04,786 --> 01:58:13,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael Atkinson is the South Australian Attorney General, and apparently he's the reason why there is no R18-plus rating for games.

1560
01:58:13,908 --> 01:58:15,529
[SPEAKER_03]: He's stepping down, and the thought is...

1561
01:58:16,309 --> 01:58:19,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe somebody will get in there that knows what they're talking about with this rating system.

1562
01:58:19,970 --> 01:58:25,692
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe we won't have so many stories about Australia gets such and such banned game or what have you in the future.

1563
01:58:26,152 --> 01:58:27,172
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be exciting for them.

1564
01:58:27,752 --> 01:58:29,293
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll hope, at least, anyway, for them.

1565
01:58:30,593 --> 01:58:32,274
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's get back into some news.

1566
01:58:32,514 --> 01:58:33,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what you got for us tonight?

1567
01:58:34,344 --> 01:58:39,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently Pikmin 3 is in development and Miyamoto has confirmed that.

1568
01:58:39,746 --> 01:58:43,427
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe he confirmed it before though if you ask me, but whatever.

1569
01:58:43,647 --> 01:58:53,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently the official Nintendo magazine in the UK was saying that Miyamoto has confirmed that Pikmin 3 development is well underway.

1570
01:58:54,490 --> 01:59:01,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Over a year ago it was rumored to be released apparently around this time, but it's not obviously.

1571
01:59:03,974 --> 01:59:08,359
[SPEAKER_02]: and no word exactly what they're going to change about it.

1572
01:59:09,160 --> 01:59:13,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, the thought is maybe they're going to announce something at E3.

1573
01:59:16,411 --> 01:59:17,613
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1574
01:59:34,913 --> 01:59:35,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1575
01:59:55,200 --> 01:59:58,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Pikmin 3 is probably not going to be any different than Pikmin 2.

1576
01:59:59,061 --> 02:00:02,563
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll just be on the Wii, and you'll buy it anyways because you're a sucker.

1577
02:00:02,643 --> 02:00:08,385
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think this is going to have the same draw as, say, a Mario Galaxy or something like that.

1578
02:00:08,845 --> 02:00:18,709
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, not that this would be a horrible thing, I think it would be a very cheap thing to do, but I could see Nintendo doing another new Super Mario Bros.

1579
02:00:18,769 --> 02:00:19,909
[SPEAKER_02]: game this soon.

1580
02:00:20,369 --> 02:00:21,250
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

1581
02:00:21,330 --> 02:00:22,070
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very possible.

1582
02:00:23,403 --> 02:00:28,046
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to the chat room and I asked in chat at chat.ornersloungeradio.com I said, chat, help me out.

1583
02:00:28,086 --> 02:00:29,286
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the appeal of Pikmin?

1584
02:00:29,387 --> 02:00:30,867
[SPEAKER_03]: And Gditz replied, is there any?

1585
02:00:31,648 --> 02:00:34,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft replied, Pikmin is basically an RTS, but cute.

1586
02:00:35,870 --> 02:00:37,231
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is apparently what it is.

1587
02:00:37,291 --> 02:00:38,572
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an RTS, but cute.

1588
02:00:39,933 --> 02:00:40,473
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.

1589
02:00:42,074 --> 02:00:46,436
[SPEAKER_03]: And Toygak seems to think, if Pikmin 3 does not equal 2, then 3 does not equal 1.

1590
02:00:47,517 --> 02:00:49,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Frisbee says, Pikmin was great 9 years ago.

1591
02:00:50,238 --> 02:00:51,879
[SPEAKER_03]: LamaJu says, I like Pikmin 1.

1592
02:00:51,919 --> 02:00:52,920
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought the game was really fun.

1593
02:00:54,028 --> 02:00:56,530
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it's just one of those games I never got around to playing.

1594
02:00:57,291 --> 02:01:00,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Togak also chimes in and says, I fucking hate the new play controls.

1595
02:01:01,335 --> 02:01:03,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Spike McCrew says, it's got calm music.

1596
02:01:04,358 --> 02:01:07,541
[SPEAKER_02]: We need a new Star Fox or a new F-Zero.

1597
02:01:07,601 --> 02:01:08,322
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we need.

1598
02:01:12,557 --> 02:01:18,560
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, I've got another story for you guys, and it has to do with the first lady, Michelle Obama.

1599
02:01:18,620 --> 02:01:22,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, video games and the White House, believe it or not.

1600
02:01:22,583 --> 02:01:29,847
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently it's because the government has kind of, in a way, endorsed Dance Dance Revolution.

1601
02:01:30,828 --> 02:01:32,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let me explain how this works here.

1602
02:01:32,650 --> 02:01:39,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's Move is a new program, and First Lady Michelle Obama was there for the kickoff, and she actually mentioned the game by name in her speech.

1603
02:01:40,336 --> 02:01:44,899
[SPEAKER_03]: She said, and I have to say that many of you have been very creative on this piece already.

1604
02:01:44,999 --> 02:01:53,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Folks in West Virginia have taken the lead in bringing DDR, that's Dance Dance Revolution, it's a new video game that gets kids up and moving.

1605
02:01:53,346 --> 02:01:54,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Haha, new.

1606
02:01:54,086 --> 02:01:55,187
[SPEAKER_03]: That game's been around since, what, 98?

1607
02:01:56,468 --> 02:02:25,838
[SPEAKER_03]: many other states use it as well and let me tell you I can attest to Dance Dance Revolution we got it at Camp David and it'll make you sweat and it's addictive in a very good way the president still can't do it so anyhow that's cute I want to point out that Let's Move is not just about DDR though but it's more about getting you know kids and stuff up and moving so it's a good thing they didn't call the program Let Them Move though because that would have been a big groan from the DDR crowd

1608
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:30,723
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the fact though that it's a quote-unquote new video game.

1609
02:02:31,864 --> 02:02:33,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, technically that's true.

1610
02:02:33,546 --> 02:02:36,789
[SPEAKER_02]: They're making new video games in that series all the time.

1611
02:02:37,730 --> 02:02:39,012
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just nowhere near new.

1612
02:02:41,154 --> 02:02:44,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, DarkSakura's got a story for us and then Listless is coming up.

1613
02:02:46,121 --> 02:02:57,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Steam is, of course, removing Assassin's Creed 2 and Silent Hunter 5, but it says it wasn't because of the DRM.

1614
02:02:57,908 --> 02:03:03,572
[SPEAKER_09]: They're actually available in places other than Steam.

1615
02:03:04,152 --> 02:03:06,733
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just specifically that Steam UK...

1616
02:03:09,518 --> 02:03:11,281
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't wanting to deal with it.

1617
02:03:11,341 --> 02:03:16,868
[SPEAKER_09]: They said that it has to do with local business discussion between Ubisoft and Steam in the UK.

1618
02:03:17,548 --> 02:03:19,331
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, it's no longer available.

1619
02:03:23,188 --> 02:03:26,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess they didn't want to try to fix it.

1620
02:03:27,331 --> 02:03:34,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I know Steam is denying it, and it's probably accurate because it sounds like this is isolated to overseas.

1621
02:03:34,757 --> 02:03:35,898
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really happening here.

1622
02:03:35,918 --> 02:03:36,879
[SPEAKER_03]: This is UK specifically.

1623
02:03:36,899 --> 02:03:38,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1624
02:03:38,981 --> 02:03:47,528
[SPEAKER_03]: But I still go back to the point I was saying before when I was talking about how Ubisoft's DRM is not just going to get Ubisoft in trouble, that they're going to be calling places like...

1625
02:03:48,331 --> 02:03:57,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Target and Walmart where people buy these games saying my game doesn't work and returning it and the retailer is going to get caught in the middle and the minute that starts happening they're going to stop carrying these games.

1626
02:03:57,736 --> 02:04:00,697
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think it's ridiculous how people don't think any of this through.

1627
02:04:01,437 --> 02:04:01,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1628
02:04:03,038 --> 02:04:10,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Well folks, it is that time and we haven't done this in a little while on the show but I'm very excited that tonight we are bringing back for 360th episode Listless!

1629
02:04:17,591 --> 02:04:21,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Now there's a lot of people in our chat room that are kind of newer to the show and they don't know how this works.

1630
02:04:21,774 --> 02:04:23,075
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me explain it for you guys.

1631
02:04:23,595 --> 02:04:29,279
[SPEAKER_03]: What we're going to do is we're going to go around the room and we are going to create the definitive list about a certain topic.

1632
02:04:29,719 --> 02:04:34,603
[SPEAKER_03]: And tonight's topic is the great idea that Microsoft should steal and make better next.

1633
02:04:35,103 --> 02:04:40,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes our answers are serious, sometimes they're silly, sometimes they're completely nonsensical.

1634
02:04:40,546 --> 02:04:44,769
[SPEAKER_03]: But like it or not, it is the list that we have come up with for the question.

1635
02:04:45,229 --> 02:04:50,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, once all four of us, since we have our special guest Alan tonight, come up with our list, we'll have a list of 12.

1636
02:04:51,873 --> 02:04:53,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the hard part comes.

1637
02:04:53,434 --> 02:04:57,517
[SPEAKER_03]: We will each go around the room and remove one item from the list.

1638
02:04:57,697 --> 02:05:01,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually it's someone else's item, but you can remove your own, I suppose, if you are feeling cannibalistic like that.

1639
02:05:02,440 --> 02:05:04,641
[SPEAKER_03]: That will leave us with a list of eight questions.

1640
02:05:04,801 --> 02:05:10,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Then our chat room will vote for their number one and number two favorite in a private message to me.

1641
02:05:10,984 --> 02:05:18,428
[SPEAKER_03]: And then your top three answers, based on your votes, will come up with our definitive list.

1642
02:05:19,228 --> 02:05:21,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Now keep in mind, you can send us a private message.

1643
02:05:21,129 --> 02:05:30,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Now if you have an answer, if you want to help the hosts out, because sometimes we are thinking of topics right in the heat of the moment, Loki,

1644
02:05:31,175 --> 02:05:43,874
[SPEAKER_03]: you can yell out your answers in chat right now and they might get included in the host list so again that is the great idea that Microsoft Microsoft Microsoft Microsoft Microsoft

1645
02:05:46,078 --> 02:05:48,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I never met a carrot I didn't like, except for this one.

1646
02:05:49,120 --> 02:05:52,062
[SPEAKER_03]: The great idea that Microsoft should steal next.

1647
02:05:52,823 --> 02:05:54,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, who wants to start us off tonight?

1648
02:05:54,964 --> 02:05:57,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, I'll call on you and see if you did your homework.

1649
02:05:57,606 --> 02:06:03,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, your number three answer for the great idea, because again, I want to remind you guys where this topic comes from.

1650
02:06:04,270 --> 02:06:05,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Project Natal.

1651
02:06:05,931 --> 02:06:07,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Stolen motion controller, basically.

1652
02:06:09,453 --> 02:06:13,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox Live, kind of taking some things from PC gaming and incorporating into their games.

1653
02:06:15,056 --> 02:06:17,498
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Xbox takes other people's ideas.

1654
02:06:17,618 --> 02:06:19,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that there's anything wrong with that, because they make them better.

1655
02:06:20,019 --> 02:06:21,380
[SPEAKER_03]: They take other people's ideas and make them better.

1656
02:06:21,880 --> 02:06:22,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1657
02:06:23,281 --> 02:06:23,822
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we go.

1658
02:06:24,302 --> 02:06:26,524
[SPEAKER_03]: What should they improve next?

1659
02:06:26,644 --> 02:06:29,187
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess it doesn't have to be gaming related, but it helps.

1660
02:06:29,267 --> 02:06:33,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Loki, what is your... Oops, I gotta get my little whiteboard up here to keep track of our answers.

1661
02:06:34,292 --> 02:06:38,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what is your number three answer for the idea that they should steal next?

1662
02:06:38,516 --> 02:06:38,976
[SPEAKER_02]: The PSP.

1663
02:06:40,217 --> 02:06:44,100
[SPEAKER_03]: The PSP, so making like a handheld system essentially, or just the PSP?

1664
02:06:44,840 --> 02:06:45,841
[SPEAKER_02]: No, a handheld system.

1665
02:06:46,921 --> 02:07:01,791
[SPEAKER_02]: They shouldn't exactly make it like the PSP, but like, you know, something that's a widescreen, you know, possibly high def, you know, handheld system, plays decent games, maybe ties in with Xbox Live Arcade and, you know, Xbox Live and that kind of stuff.

1666
02:07:02,251 --> 02:07:02,812
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be kind of cool.

1667
02:07:03,152 --> 02:07:05,413
[SPEAKER_03]: So Loki is kind of going serious for once.

1668
02:07:05,473 --> 02:07:06,834
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a little less scary to me.

1669
02:07:07,234 --> 02:07:07,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't be like that.

1670
02:07:08,575 --> 02:07:09,416
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, fine, fine.

1671
02:07:10,037 --> 02:07:12,765
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, your number three answer.

1672
02:07:12,845 --> 02:07:14,430
[SPEAKER_03]: What should Microsoft steal and make better?

1673
02:07:14,811 --> 02:07:15,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Pokemans.

1674
02:07:17,901 --> 02:07:18,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Pokemon, okay.

1675
02:07:18,801 --> 02:07:19,641
[SPEAKER_09]: No, Pokemans.

1676
02:07:20,102 --> 02:07:21,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I have to say Pokemans.

1677
02:07:21,342 --> 02:07:22,882
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what it's going to be called, is Pokemans.

1678
02:07:23,022 --> 02:07:23,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Pokemans.

1679
02:07:24,162 --> 02:07:30,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess that's true, is that they, you know, there was rumors that they had that little monster-making game.

1680
02:07:30,344 --> 02:07:32,464
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that was more LittleBigPlanet, though, than Pokemans.

1681
02:07:32,564 --> 02:07:37,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so Microsoft should make the Pokemon MMO, or the Pokeman MMO.

1682
02:07:37,146 --> 02:07:37,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Pokemans.

1683
02:07:37,946 --> 02:07:38,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1684
02:07:39,346 --> 02:07:43,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan, your number three answer, what should Microsoft steal and make better?

1685
02:07:43,607 --> 02:07:46,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Colonel Sanders secret recipe for chicken.

1686
02:07:48,229 --> 02:07:48,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Chicken!

1687
02:07:49,950 --> 02:07:51,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Bringing back the chicken reference.

1688
02:07:51,871 --> 02:07:56,994
[SPEAKER_04]: So that way I can, like, go into the Avatar store and get my Avatar, you know, a two-piece and a biscuit or whatever.

1689
02:08:01,136 --> 02:08:03,097
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, Alan just made a Drag Race reference.

1690
02:08:03,157 --> 02:08:03,937
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to point out.

1691
02:08:04,237 --> 02:08:05,178
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't know it, but he did.

1692
02:08:09,022 --> 02:08:09,903
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you spell Colonel?

1693
02:08:09,963 --> 02:08:10,985
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't ever remember.

1694
02:08:11,005 --> 02:08:17,133
[SPEAKER_10]: D-O-L-O-N-E-L Very good, Alan.

1695
02:08:17,173 --> 02:08:17,593
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.

1696
02:08:18,014 --> 02:08:21,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, the idea that Microsoft should steal and make better.

1697
02:08:21,578 --> 02:08:22,700
[SPEAKER_03]: My number three answer.

1698
02:08:23,321 --> 02:08:24,663
[SPEAKER_03]: The lesbian tester.

1699
02:08:26,158 --> 02:08:26,618
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

1700
02:08:48,662 --> 02:08:52,743
[SPEAKER_02]: The George Foreman Full Cow Grilling Machine

1701
02:09:11,227 --> 02:09:23,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the machine that can be only put out, I guess, by Microsoft that would take George Foreman grilling to the next level by fully grilling an entire cow at one time.

1702
02:09:24,714 --> 02:09:25,114
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1703
02:09:26,155 --> 02:09:26,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough.

1704
02:09:27,956 --> 02:09:30,017
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, your number two answer.

1705
02:09:32,518 --> 02:09:36,600
[SPEAKER_09]: An expansion module like the ColecoVision has so you can play other systems games on it.

1706
02:09:38,601 --> 02:09:39,402
[SPEAKER_09]: You remember that, don't you?

1707
02:09:41,717 --> 02:09:43,018
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember you talking about it.

1708
02:09:43,238 --> 02:09:44,718
[SPEAKER_09]: The expansion module number two.

1709
02:09:45,138 --> 02:09:46,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, alright.

1710
02:09:48,059 --> 02:09:49,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan, do you have a number two answer?

1711
02:09:49,159 --> 02:09:53,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see something come back like the Dreamcast VMU.

1712
02:09:53,921 --> 02:09:55,781
[SPEAKER_04]: A little memory card with the LED thing.

1713
02:09:55,961 --> 02:09:59,542
[SPEAKER_03]: So memory cards on the... The visual memory unit.

1714
02:09:59,762 --> 02:10:00,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, visual memory cards.

1715
02:10:00,903 --> 02:10:01,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I like that idea.

1716
02:10:01,863 --> 02:10:02,383
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good idea.

1717
02:10:02,683 --> 02:10:03,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Any particular reason why that?

1718
02:10:03,843 --> 02:10:04,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Chow's on it.

1719
02:10:06,524 --> 02:10:07,585
[SPEAKER_04]: It will help with the Pokemans.

1720
02:10:08,646 --> 02:10:10,107
[SPEAKER_03]: For the Pokemon game they're going to release.

1721
02:10:10,527 --> 02:10:11,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, very good.

1722
02:10:12,369 --> 02:10:13,330
[SPEAKER_03]: My number two answer.

1723
02:10:13,850 --> 02:10:14,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, where is my list?

1724
02:10:14,971 --> 02:10:17,893
[SPEAKER_03]: My number two answer for the idea that Xbox should steal and make better.

1725
02:10:18,594 --> 02:10:23,497
[SPEAKER_03]: A game starring a fat plumber and his brother and a game starring a fruity elf with big ears.

1726
02:10:24,378 --> 02:10:24,758
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

1727
02:10:46,528 --> 02:11:00,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Pokemans, The Colonel's Recipe, The Hot Lesbian Tester, George Foreman Full Cow Grilling Machine, an expansion module for other system games, visual memory cards, a game starring a fat plumber and his brother, and a game starring a fruity elf with big ears.

1728
02:11:01,198 --> 02:11:01,499
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1729
02:11:02,359 --> 02:11:06,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we get down to the number one answers.

1730
02:11:06,460 --> 02:11:11,242
[SPEAKER_03]: The number one thing you most want to see the Xbox 360 steal and make better.

1731
02:11:11,942 --> 02:11:12,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

1732
02:11:12,702 --> 02:11:18,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if they're going to be guaranteed to make something better, I can't think of a better response than sex.

1733
02:11:18,944 --> 02:11:22,985
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not really much better than sex, but...

1734
02:11:25,327 --> 02:11:27,229
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that they're going to find a way to make it better.

1735
02:11:28,591 --> 02:11:29,412
[SPEAKER_02]: More power to them.

1736
02:11:30,674 --> 02:11:34,078
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, Microsoft impressed me about making something better than sex.

1737
02:11:34,679 --> 02:11:35,100
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1738
02:11:38,264 --> 02:11:39,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sex better.

1739
02:11:44,757 --> 02:11:45,537
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura!

1740
02:12:11,872 --> 02:12:13,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Dare I ask for your number one answer.

1741
02:12:13,793 --> 02:12:15,093
[SPEAKER_03]: What should they steal and make better?

1742
02:12:16,133 --> 02:12:17,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Rainbow farting unicorns.

1743
02:12:17,494 --> 02:12:20,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Rainbow farting unicorns.

1744
02:12:20,375 --> 02:12:23,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you talking about, what is that, robot magic unicorn?

1745
02:12:24,216 --> 02:12:25,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever it is.

1746
02:12:25,497 --> 02:12:26,277
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the name of the game?

1747
02:12:27,057 --> 02:12:29,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, my original answer was Propel.

1748
02:12:29,618 --> 02:12:31,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Propel, but you want robot unicorn attack.

1749
02:12:32,619 --> 02:12:34,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Farty robot unicorns.

1750
02:12:35,540 --> 02:12:37,601
[SPEAKER_09]: It's rainbow farting unicorns.

1751
02:12:39,099 --> 02:12:39,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1752
02:12:40,640 --> 02:12:41,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Rainbow farting.

1753
02:12:41,621 --> 02:12:43,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Rainbow farty or farting?

1754
02:12:43,683 --> 02:12:44,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Farting.

1755
02:12:44,304 --> 02:12:45,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Robot unicorn.

1756
02:12:45,124 --> 02:12:46,486
[SPEAKER_09]: That's their special attack is they fart.

1757
02:12:46,506 --> 02:12:47,406
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

1758
02:12:47,907 --> 02:12:48,507
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1759
02:12:48,587 --> 02:12:50,349
[SPEAKER_09]: To an all erasure soundtrack.

1760
02:12:50,970 --> 02:12:52,271
[SPEAKER_03]: To an all erasure soundtrack.

1761
02:12:52,291 --> 02:12:52,671
[SPEAKER_03]: You got it.

1762
02:12:52,691 --> 02:12:53,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Or Pet Shop Boys works too.

1763
02:12:54,032 --> 02:12:54,753
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura?

1764
02:12:55,353 --> 02:12:56,254
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to let it go.

1765
02:12:59,217 --> 02:12:59,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1766
02:13:00,378 --> 02:13:05,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Your number one answer, Alan, what is your number one answer for a thing you want Microsoft to steal and make better?

1767
02:13:09,514 --> 02:13:10,034
[SPEAKER_03]: He's thinking.

1768
02:13:10,194 --> 02:13:10,814
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm blanking.

1769
02:13:11,134 --> 02:13:11,494
[SPEAKER_03]: You're blanking?

1770
02:13:11,534 --> 02:13:12,955
[SPEAKER_03]: After the sex thing, I just can't.

1771
02:13:13,055 --> 02:13:14,435
[SPEAKER_03]: After the sex thing, you just can't?

1772
02:13:14,475 --> 02:13:14,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I help you?

1773
02:13:15,295 --> 02:13:15,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1774
02:13:15,975 --> 02:13:16,555
[SPEAKER_03]: The Bible.

1775
02:13:17,435 --> 02:13:18,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yeah.

1776
02:13:18,896 --> 02:13:19,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesus.

1777
02:13:19,596 --> 02:13:21,716
[SPEAKER_04]: If they could just do Jesus.

1778
02:13:22,396 --> 02:13:23,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Jesus.

1779
02:13:26,117 --> 02:13:28,497
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to do the YouTube you sent me earlier?

1780
02:13:28,877 --> 02:13:30,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, fine.

1781
02:13:30,658 --> 02:13:33,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus is the idea that they're going to steal and make better.

1782
02:13:33,858 --> 02:13:34,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1783
02:13:37,019 --> 02:13:37,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Lord.

1784
02:13:38,061 --> 02:13:44,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, and my number one answer I don't know, I just kind of decided to go for the obvious Blu-ray!

1785
02:13:47,104 --> 02:13:56,348
[SPEAKER_03]: They already did, it was HD DVD But it wasn't really better I mean, and they kind of came out at the same time But now that Blu-ray is out They can take Blu-ray and make it better

1786
02:13:58,068 --> 02:13:58,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1787
02:13:58,709 --> 02:13:59,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Robot Jesus attack?

1788
02:13:59,749 --> 02:14:00,510
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be kinda cool.

1789
02:14:01,110 --> 02:14:02,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go!

1790
02:14:02,450 --> 02:14:05,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the list as it stands before the elimination.

1791
02:14:05,492 --> 02:14:25,941
[SPEAKER_03]: A handheld system, Pokemans, The Colonel's Recipe, The Hot Lesbian Tester, George Foreman's Full Cow Grilling Machine, an expansion module for other system games, visual memory cards, a game starring a fat plumber and his brother, and a game starring a fruity elf with big ears, sex, rainbow farting robot unicorns, Jesus, and Blu-ray.

1792
02:14:26,881 --> 02:14:29,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Things that Microsoft is going to steal and make better.

1793
02:14:29,926 --> 02:14:33,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what is not worthy of being on the list?

1794
02:14:33,471 --> 02:14:35,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, we've got to narrow this down to eight.

1795
02:14:35,594 --> 02:14:36,715
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a tough process.

1796
02:14:37,016 --> 02:14:37,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Feelings will be hurt.

1797
02:14:38,057 --> 02:14:38,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Hair will be pulled.

1798
02:14:39,179 --> 02:14:40,340
[SPEAKER_03]: But it must happen.

1799
02:14:40,701 --> 02:14:42,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?

1800
02:14:42,904 --> 02:14:44,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Blu-ray because it's going to get phased out anyways.

1801
02:14:45,145 --> 02:14:45,785
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a bastard.

1802
02:14:46,525 --> 02:14:48,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Blu-rays off the list.

1803
02:14:48,906 --> 02:14:52,047
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?

1804
02:14:52,287 --> 02:14:52,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Sex.

1805
02:14:53,928 --> 02:14:55,549
[SPEAKER_03]: You eliminated sex?

1806
02:14:55,689 --> 02:14:56,429
[SPEAKER_09]: It's overrated.

1807
02:14:56,649 --> 02:14:59,050
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're going to make it better.

1808
02:14:59,970 --> 02:15:01,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, better sex.

1809
02:15:02,231 --> 02:15:04,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, this is kind of...

1810
02:15:06,363 --> 02:15:09,327
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura has eliminated sex from the list.

1811
02:15:09,347 --> 02:15:11,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob knows why I don't want it on the list.

1812
02:15:11,109 --> 02:15:13,391
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I understand, but it's just funny.

1813
02:15:13,431 --> 02:15:14,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Our chat room is going to yell and scream.

1814
02:15:14,793 --> 02:15:15,634
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be hair pulling.

1815
02:15:15,694 --> 02:15:16,535
[SPEAKER_07]: It's boring.

1816
02:15:18,097 --> 02:15:18,818
[SPEAKER_07]: It is boring.

1817
02:15:18,858 --> 02:15:19,879
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're going to make it better.

1818
02:15:21,459 --> 02:15:23,680
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll launch and then all of a sudden, Red Rings.

1819
02:15:24,520 --> 02:15:25,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no.

1820
02:15:26,120 --> 02:15:26,880
[SPEAKER_09]: That's true.

1821
02:15:26,920 --> 02:15:28,661
[SPEAKER_09]: But it won't matter for the guys involved.

1822
02:15:28,801 --> 02:15:29,781
[SPEAKER_09]: They never have a problem.

1823
02:15:29,861 --> 02:15:31,342
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want Red Rings on my balls.

1824
02:15:31,522 --> 02:15:31,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1825
02:15:33,862 --> 02:15:36,023
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be over before the women enjoy it.

1826
02:15:36,203 --> 02:15:36,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1827
02:15:38,063 --> 02:15:40,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan, which of these is not worthy?

1828
02:15:41,164 --> 02:15:43,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, DarkSakura's getting booed by chat.

1829
02:15:43,445 --> 02:15:45,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Go in there and regulate, DarkSakura.

1830
02:15:45,165 --> 02:15:45,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1831
02:15:50,095 --> 02:15:52,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan, which of these is not worthy of the list?

1832
02:15:52,236 --> 02:15:53,496
[SPEAKER_03]: The hot lesbian tester.

1833
02:15:53,956 --> 02:15:55,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you bastard!

1834
02:15:56,137 --> 02:15:56,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

1835
02:15:57,217 --> 02:15:58,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you not love lesbians?

1836
02:15:58,878 --> 02:16:00,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wait, I'm asking the wrong person.

1837
02:16:01,979 --> 02:16:04,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are you taking the hot lesbian tester off the list?

1838
02:16:04,680 --> 02:16:05,060
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1839
02:16:06,360 --> 02:16:07,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because it's my answer, huh?

1840
02:16:07,360 --> 02:16:07,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

1841
02:16:08,001 --> 02:16:08,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Dick.

1842
02:16:08,801 --> 02:16:09,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1843
02:16:12,882 --> 02:16:16,364
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to wish that the 360 had the sex support pretty soon.

1844
02:16:16,765 --> 02:16:17,085
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1845
02:16:18,986 --> 02:16:21,187
[SPEAKER_03]: The item I'm going to eliminate from the list.

1846
02:16:21,668 --> 02:16:29,152
[SPEAKER_03]: I am taking off the George Foreman full cow grilling machine because that joke is so 2007.

1847
02:16:29,212 --> 02:16:31,474
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the PS3 that looks like one.

1848
02:16:32,154 --> 02:16:33,475
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want them to copy that.

1849
02:16:33,935 --> 02:16:35,056
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the PS3 things.

1850
02:16:35,116 --> 02:16:36,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Let Sony have something.

1851
02:16:36,869 --> 02:16:38,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so that's why I've eliminated her from the list.

1852
02:16:38,811 --> 02:16:40,232
[SPEAKER_03]: So, here we go.

1853
02:16:40,252 --> 02:16:41,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Slim can only do Veal.

1854
02:16:41,973 --> 02:16:44,595
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the eight that you can vote for tonight.

1855
02:16:45,275 --> 02:16:59,787
[SPEAKER_03]: A handheld system, Pokemans, The Colonel's Recipe, an expansion module for other system games, visual memory cards, a game starring a fat plumber and his brother, and a game starring a fruity elf with big ears, rainbow farting robot unicorns, and...

1856
02:17:00,507 --> 02:17:00,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus.

1857
02:17:01,648 --> 02:17:04,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Which of these should they steal and make better?

1858
02:17:04,809 --> 02:17:10,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your two votes.

1859
02:17:11,653 --> 02:17:15,935
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want the blur beta code, I have two to give away tonight.

1860
02:17:16,295 --> 02:17:21,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Send in your votes and a message that says, I want the Blur Beta code or something along those lines.

1861
02:17:22,257 --> 02:17:27,099
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't want the Blur Beta code, don't send me that message, but you can still send me your votes.

1862
02:17:27,699 --> 02:17:33,862
[SPEAKER_03]: So you send me an additional message that says, I want the Blur Beta code.

1863
02:17:33,902 --> 02:17:38,863
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't know how to send a private message, I will recap that process for you in chat real soon.

1864
02:17:39,484 --> 02:17:42,565
[SPEAKER_03]: For now, back to the show while those votes come in.

1865
02:17:44,526 --> 02:17:46,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Some folks in chat said we made the list boring.

1866
02:17:46,546 --> 02:17:48,427
[SPEAKER_03]: We took off every single interesting answer.

1867
02:17:48,467 --> 02:17:50,708
[SPEAKER_03]: We took off the lesbians, the sex, the meat.

1868
02:17:51,509 --> 02:17:52,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything was gone.

1869
02:17:53,590 --> 02:17:55,751
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, the beta code is only on the 360.

1870
02:17:56,691 --> 02:17:57,431
[SPEAKER_03]: You must have a 360.

1871
02:17:58,132 --> 02:18:00,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Please do not ask for the code if you yourself are not going to use it.

1872
02:18:00,833 --> 02:18:04,394
[SPEAKER_03]: If you sell that shit on eBay, I will find you and I will end your life.

1873
02:18:05,015 --> 02:18:05,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1874
02:18:06,836 --> 02:18:07,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

1875
02:18:08,769 --> 02:18:09,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1876
02:18:34,605 --> 02:18:36,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Warriors and Archers Xbox 360, PS3, Games for Windows

1877
02:18:55,635 --> 02:19:00,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Was this like the top secret game that Bethesda is supposedly working on that everybody thought was the Blizzard MMO?

1878
02:19:00,899 --> 02:19:03,741
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but it looks like it's just like a hack and slash game.

1879
02:19:03,761 --> 02:19:04,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks cool though.

1880
02:19:04,562 --> 02:19:05,262
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks really neat.

1881
02:19:07,384 --> 02:19:10,987
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, I don't know if this is the top secret game they're working on.

1882
02:19:11,007 --> 02:19:13,609
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is Bethesda, not Blizzard.

1883
02:19:17,519 --> 02:19:18,501
[SPEAKER_03]: I meant to say Bethesda.

1884
02:19:18,521 --> 02:19:19,041
[SPEAKER_03]: I say Blizzard.

1885
02:19:19,262 --> 02:19:23,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I'm getting distracted with tallying the votes for listless right now.

1886
02:19:24,430 --> 02:19:28,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me get to this next story real quick about layoffs at IGN.

1887
02:19:29,056 --> 02:19:30,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, layoffs have...

1888
02:19:32,131 --> 02:19:56,143
[SPEAKER_03]: hit IGN and um yep too bad so sad sorry to hear it uh but unfortunately a lot of folks uh got laid off over at IGN and um I don't know I guess that'll be less podcast all departments all right times are tough I'm sorry times are tough and it's not funny when people lose their jobs but um you know it's tough out there it's hard out there for a pimp what can I say

1889
02:19:59,242 --> 02:20:03,668
[SPEAKER_03]: If they really love games, there'll be people doing it for free, just like many other people do.

1890
02:20:04,509 --> 02:20:05,190
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we'll see.

1891
02:20:05,491 --> 02:20:06,592
[SPEAKER_08]: No one in particular, Rob, right?

1892
02:20:06,812 --> 02:20:07,533
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no one in particular.

1893
02:20:07,654 --> 02:20:09,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's get to the mailbag.

1894
02:20:09,376 --> 02:20:10,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Every week you guys send us emails.

1895
02:20:10,658 --> 02:20:13,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and we read some here on air.

1896
02:20:15,831 --> 02:20:20,135
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura is going to open up the mailbag, rip it right open, and pull out some of her favorite emails.

1897
02:20:20,796 --> 02:20:21,977
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm reading them for you right now.

1898
02:20:22,097 --> 02:20:28,462
[SPEAKER_09]: I would be happy to, but my window that had all the emails on it actually just completely vanished, so I have to reopen them.

1899
02:20:28,482 --> 02:20:29,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you reopen it real quick?

1900
02:20:30,004 --> 02:20:32,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, because I've got to tally the cage match votes here.

1901
02:20:33,087 --> 02:20:34,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sorry, listless votes.

1902
02:20:35,929 --> 02:20:36,870
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm pulling it back up.

1903
02:20:37,030 --> 02:20:37,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1904
02:20:38,071 --> 02:20:39,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep your pants on.

1905
02:20:39,112 --> 02:20:39,733
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want dead air.

1906
02:20:40,433 --> 02:20:42,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what are you watching over there?

1907
02:20:42,195 --> 02:20:42,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.

1908
02:20:42,695 --> 02:20:43,756
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got the first one.

1909
02:20:43,816 --> 02:20:51,903
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm watching a violent video of someone making levels in WarioWare DIY, like blowing someone in half.

1910
02:20:52,183 --> 02:20:52,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's another one.

1911
02:20:52,924 --> 02:20:55,226
[SPEAKER_02]: They're shooting them.

1912
02:20:56,607 --> 02:20:57,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Shooting with rainbow farts?

1913
02:20:57,828 --> 02:20:58,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Sniper rifle.

1914
02:20:59,542 --> 02:21:00,423
[SPEAKER_09]: This is from Cheeseburger.

1915
02:21:00,763 --> 02:21:01,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay.

1916
02:21:01,483 --> 02:21:02,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, OLR.

1917
02:21:02,204 --> 02:21:05,665
[SPEAKER_09]: As you may or may not know, I've been saving up for gaming PC for a year now.

1918
02:21:06,546 --> 02:21:10,168
[SPEAKER_09]: I finally got the money just this morning and I spent $1,300 at Newegg.

1919
02:21:10,548 --> 02:21:13,670
[SPEAKER_09]: This PC will be good enough to run almost any game on near highest settings.

1920
02:21:13,730 --> 02:21:15,631
[SPEAKER_09]: The only games I have right now are World of Warcraft.

1921
02:21:16,371 --> 02:21:16,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Addict!

1922
02:21:17,452 --> 02:21:18,213
[SPEAKER_09]: and Command & Conquer 3.

1923
02:21:18,553 --> 02:21:21,936
[SPEAKER_09]: In a few hours, I'm hoping to win an eBay auction of Crysis.

1924
02:21:22,177 --> 02:21:25,820
[SPEAKER_09]: My question is, do you have any recommendations for games I should get?

1925
02:21:26,221 --> 02:21:29,344
[SPEAKER_09]: When the game was released, it was no matter, just that they are good games.

1926
02:21:29,504 --> 02:21:30,245
[SPEAKER_09]: I suggest Loom.

1927
02:21:35,069 --> 02:21:36,050
[SPEAKER_09]: And Star Trek Online.

1928
02:21:37,031 --> 02:21:39,754
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, some of the Borderlands is pretty cool if you don't have that.

1929
02:21:41,452 --> 02:21:43,314
[SPEAKER_09]: He also sends a follow-up to the email.

1930
02:21:43,974 --> 02:21:48,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Forgot to mention in my last email, yesterday my friend had a 16th birthday party at John's Incredible Pizza.

1931
02:21:48,858 --> 02:21:49,858
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, what a place for that.

1932
02:21:49,898 --> 02:21:52,820
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was wondering, why have you given it the title John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza?

1933
02:21:52,840 --> 02:21:56,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait, we have somebody here local that's been to John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza?

1934
02:21:56,183 --> 02:21:57,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Because those are only in NorCal.

1935
02:21:58,104 --> 02:22:00,945
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as I know, unless they really grew fast.

1936
02:22:01,245 --> 02:22:03,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, did you eat the pizza when you were there?

1937
02:22:03,165 --> 02:22:04,006
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of shitty.

1938
02:22:04,746 --> 02:22:08,807
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been sitting out for a long time, and little kids put their hands all over it and all that stuff.

1939
02:22:09,327 --> 02:22:10,447
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the place is okay.

1940
02:22:10,627 --> 02:22:14,969
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, actually, I gotta say, it was really cool, because one of the workers there once, like, recognized us.

1941
02:22:15,049 --> 02:22:18,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how, but they did, and I thought that was really awesome.

1942
02:22:18,550 --> 02:22:19,270
[SPEAKER_09]: And Dan was there, too.

1943
02:22:19,450 --> 02:22:19,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1944
02:22:20,050 --> 02:22:21,931
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, no.

1945
02:22:21,971 --> 02:22:22,531
[SPEAKER_03]: They're fine.

1946
02:22:22,671 --> 02:22:26,252
[SPEAKER_03]: I have nothing against John's Incredible Pizza, but it's a fun... The place was pretty fun.

1947
02:22:26,272 --> 02:22:27,212
[SPEAKER_09]: The pizza was pretty suck.

1948
02:22:27,412 --> 02:22:28,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, there you go.

1949
02:22:28,853 --> 02:22:29,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1950
02:22:30,995 --> 02:22:40,661
[SPEAKER_09]: From Robert M. From my last email a month or two ago, I tried to be clever and use a reference to the spam filters used on your forum discussion on the show, so my email was most likely lost to the spam filters.

1951
02:22:41,162 --> 02:22:41,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry about that.

1952
02:22:42,342 --> 02:22:48,006
[SPEAKER_09]: My question now is, how long are the animations for the summons for Final Fantasy XIII, and can they be skipped?

1953
02:22:48,607 --> 02:22:54,711
[SPEAKER_09]: My brother, back in the day, generally enjoyed Final Fantasy VII, but was turned off by the summons taking about, what, 10 to 15 seconds every time?

1954
02:22:55,311 --> 02:23:00,273
[SPEAKER_09]: which can actually add up to get repetitive over the course of your typical 40 hour JRPG lifespan.

1955
02:23:01,134 --> 02:23:01,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob?

1956
02:23:03,455 --> 02:23:05,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I'm focusing on tallying votes.

1957
02:23:05,036 --> 02:23:05,716
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the question?

1958
02:23:07,337 --> 02:23:09,338
[SPEAKER_09]: How long are the summon scenes?

1959
02:23:09,558 --> 02:23:11,499
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a shit ton of votes tonight.

1960
02:23:11,719 --> 02:23:13,379
[SPEAKER_09]: How long are the summon scenes?

1961
02:23:13,439 --> 02:23:14,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Not very long.

1962
02:23:15,280 --> 02:23:16,821
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think you can, but they're not very long.

1963
02:23:16,901 --> 02:23:17,501
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you can skip them.

1964
02:23:20,638 --> 02:23:21,838
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish you could skip Knights of the Round.

1965
02:23:22,259 --> 02:23:28,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, when I would do Knights of the Round on Quadra Magic and then Mimic, I had time to go make a sandwich.

1966
02:23:29,301 --> 02:23:30,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Fix myself a drink.

1967
02:23:31,002 --> 02:23:31,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Come back.

1968
02:23:31,402 --> 02:23:37,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I love how that when Square heard all of the complaints about Knights of the Round for 7 and they're like, how can we get around this for 8?

1969
02:23:38,704 --> 02:23:39,965
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, oh, I know.

1970
02:23:40,125 --> 02:23:44,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's make it so we have to watch the summon and tap Square for the boost.

1971
02:23:44,586 --> 02:23:45,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember that?

1972
02:23:45,146 --> 02:23:46,187
[SPEAKER_04]: That was their answer to that?

1973
02:23:46,327 --> 02:23:47,787
[SPEAKER_04]: To make you watch it with the power up?

1974
02:23:48,047 --> 02:23:48,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1975
02:23:48,268 --> 02:23:48,688
[SPEAKER_04]: That was funny.

1976
02:23:51,849 --> 02:23:55,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Next up... And that's all part of the reason why I hated 8, just so you know.

1977
02:23:56,812 --> 02:23:59,933
[SPEAKER_09]: This person didn't sign it, so I'm just going to say person who didn't sign their email.

1978
02:24:01,554 --> 02:24:06,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Have been wondering, have been enjoying the... Or maybe I'll just use the first part of their email, Sepwin, I guess.

1979
02:24:07,317 --> 02:24:08,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Have been enjoying the show for a while.

1980
02:24:08,758 --> 02:24:10,659
[SPEAKER_09]: One comment about Microsoft's Project Natal.

1981
02:24:11,359 --> 02:24:14,361
[SPEAKER_09]: You mentioned one thing they showed were racing games.

1982
02:24:14,381 --> 02:24:19,664
[SPEAKER_09]: As someone who's gotten heavy into sim racing games, I think that wouldn't work well even for arcade racers.

1983
02:24:20,624 --> 02:24:23,305
[SPEAKER_09]: The main reason is there would be no rumble or forced feedback to the player.

1984
02:24:23,805 --> 02:24:29,566
[SPEAKER_09]: For any racing game that isn't meant to be a total arcade experience, a wheel with feedback, preferably forced feedback, is critical.

1985
02:24:30,266 --> 02:24:33,947
[SPEAKER_09]: I would argue even burnout games need some sort of tactile response to the player.

1986
02:24:34,047 --> 02:24:34,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Best wishes.

1987
02:24:35,367 --> 02:24:36,167
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree, actually.

1988
02:24:36,627 --> 02:24:37,747
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I kind of like.

1989
02:24:38,108 --> 02:24:42,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, what was it that Rush had really crazy feedback?

1990
02:24:43,709 --> 02:24:47,309
[SPEAKER_09]: And it actually made it really fun to play, I thought.

1991
02:24:47,469 --> 02:24:50,170
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, added a much bigger level into the control.

1992
02:24:53,553 --> 02:24:54,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, last email.

1993
02:24:56,774 --> 02:24:58,155
[SPEAKER_09]: Subject, Rogue Kitty.

1994
02:24:58,675 --> 02:24:58,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1995
02:25:00,436 --> 02:25:01,917
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be where President Cat has gone.

1996
02:25:01,957 --> 02:25:04,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Rogue Kitty shall forever be known as Dictator Cat.

1997
02:25:04,318 --> 02:25:05,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Mwahaha Snow Villagers.

1998
02:25:06,639 --> 02:25:06,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1999
02:25:10,700 --> 02:25:11,121
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess.

2000
02:25:11,541 --> 02:25:12,341
[SPEAKER_09]: It came with a picture.

2001
02:25:15,322 --> 02:25:17,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

2002
02:25:18,584 --> 02:25:21,125
[SPEAKER_09]: War on string may be unwinnable, says General Cat.

2003
02:25:23,098 --> 02:25:23,599
[SPEAKER_09]: That's funny.

2004
02:25:26,162 --> 02:25:27,043
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to save the picture.

2005
02:25:27,123 --> 02:25:28,285
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll upload it somewhere.

2006
02:25:29,426 --> 02:25:30,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps our photo thing.

2007
02:25:31,890 --> 02:25:32,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Perhaps.

2008
02:25:35,074 --> 02:25:35,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, that's the last of it.

2009
02:25:38,158 --> 02:25:41,120
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not done telling votes yet, but we have some more news to get to, right?

2010
02:25:41,340 --> 02:25:42,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Or no, we got the FUs of the week.

2011
02:25:42,861 --> 02:25:43,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Some angst.

2012
02:25:44,082 --> 02:25:48,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Every week we like to take a little bit of our time out and get some angst out and some anger.

2013
02:25:49,266 --> 02:25:52,628
[SPEAKER_03]: And hopefully there's enough of it tonight to get me through the rest of the cage match votes.

2014
02:25:53,209 --> 02:25:54,149
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep saying cage match.

2015
02:25:54,249 --> 02:25:54,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Listless votes.

2016
02:25:55,290 --> 02:25:57,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week, boys and girls.

2017
02:26:13,992 --> 02:26:16,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, FU to my digestion.

2018
02:26:17,633 --> 02:26:18,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Really, that's it.

2019
02:26:21,194 --> 02:26:21,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

2020
02:26:23,895 --> 02:26:30,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm gonna have to say FU to, um, I don't really know.

2021
02:26:30,736 --> 02:26:31,397
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have anything.

2022
02:26:31,637 --> 02:26:33,237
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the lawn being too long.

2023
02:26:33,757 --> 02:26:34,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2024
02:26:37,398 --> 02:26:38,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Alan, do you have an FU this week?

2025
02:26:39,199 --> 02:26:39,759
[SPEAKER_04]: FUs to unemployment.

2026
02:26:39,779 --> 02:26:40,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Unemployment.

2027
02:26:42,540 --> 02:26:46,441
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU goes to all the boxes on my kitchen table.

2028
02:26:47,781 --> 02:26:48,701
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my FU of the week.

2029
02:26:49,882 --> 02:26:50,282
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2030
02:26:50,942 --> 02:26:53,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually I would be doing the listless results right now, but I'm not ready.

2031
02:26:53,502 --> 02:26:55,843
[SPEAKER_03]: We had so many tonight that I'm not ready.

2032
02:26:55,923 --> 02:26:58,603
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where I had it in our list, but I'll have to jump in later.

2033
02:26:58,663 --> 02:27:00,744
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Loki, would you do another story for us, please?

2034
02:27:01,124 --> 02:27:06,365
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, we will be opening the Skype line in just a little bit, but we have an interview with our friend Aaron in just a moment.

2035
02:27:06,805 --> 02:27:08,105
[SPEAKER_03]: So stay tuned.

2036
02:27:08,405 --> 02:27:17,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, apparently Bungie has re-registered or registered new trademarks for Marathon and Bungie Aerospace.

2037
02:27:17,627 --> 02:27:25,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Marathon, of course, is their first FPS that they released way back in the day, so perhaps a new game in that series.

2038
02:27:26,289 --> 02:27:31,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Bungie Aerospace, not exactly sure what the hell that's about, but...

2039
02:27:33,080 --> 02:27:33,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Bungie Aerospace

2040
02:27:49,292 --> 02:27:54,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this some type of further Halo thing, or does this give us some type of idea what they're actually going to be doing after Halo?

2041
02:27:55,395 --> 02:27:55,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

2042
02:27:57,456 --> 02:27:58,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than it being a trademark.

2043
02:27:58,716 --> 02:28:01,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, obviously, I would imagine Marathon's going to be coming at some point.

2044
02:28:02,878 --> 02:28:07,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't they release Marathon on Xbox Live Arcade, and I don't remember it being very good.

2045
02:28:07,060 --> 02:28:09,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember Marathon.

2046
02:28:09,241 --> 02:28:09,921
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they did.

2047
02:28:10,001 --> 02:28:10,502
[SPEAKER_03]: They did.

2048
02:28:10,582 --> 02:28:12,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was... Well, you know, it was an old game.

2049
02:28:13,203 --> 02:28:13,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

2050
02:28:15,604 --> 02:28:15,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

2051
02:28:20,559 --> 02:28:21,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you mind doing the next story too?

2052
02:28:21,981 --> 02:28:23,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I am still trying to tally votes.

2053
02:28:23,822 --> 02:28:25,704
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how many people we had voting tonight.

2054
02:28:26,324 --> 02:28:28,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Throw in a beta code and that's what we got.

2055
02:28:29,327 --> 02:28:29,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2056
02:28:30,608 --> 02:28:33,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently the Commodore 64 is making a return.

2057
02:28:34,371 --> 02:28:34,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2058
02:28:35,192 --> 02:28:40,657
[SPEAKER_02]: A brand new, I guess, keyboard.

2059
02:28:42,699 --> 02:28:45,221
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like it's all inclusive in this keyboard.

2060
02:28:45,241 --> 02:28:46,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2061
02:28:48,263 --> 02:28:52,665
[SPEAKER_02]: based on, they're saying, the Cybernet ZPC GX31.

2062
02:28:54,386 --> 02:28:59,928
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of cool looking, a little futuristic thing.

2063
02:28:59,968 --> 02:29:03,990
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a... I think a lot of those pictures... I'm finally done, sorry.

2064
02:29:04,230 --> 02:29:06,191
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of those pictures were prototypes.

2065
02:29:06,251 --> 02:29:11,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, they're not the actual thing, especially like that one where you see the old-ass system running Windows 95.

2066
02:29:11,113 --> 02:29:11,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

2067
02:29:12,033 --> 02:29:13,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Windows XP is, yeah.

2068
02:29:13,994 --> 02:29:14,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2069
02:29:14,554 --> 02:29:40,227
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously a little bit silly but dude I'm all about the Commodore 64 making a comeback because there was some that was like again I'm hoping it's not something that I view in a greater light because it was when I was young but there were just some awesome programs on the 64 and I love the fact here's the number one reason the 64 was awesome you could hook it up to your TV that's why that's why I won the computer wars I'm telling you at least back in the 80s the personal computer wars before the IBM's so that's kind of neat all right

2070
02:29:41,621 --> 02:29:42,382
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm finally ready.

2071
02:29:42,502 --> 02:29:46,365
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, if they released a new Commodore 64, what do you think they should put on it?

2072
02:29:47,826 --> 02:29:48,226
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2073
02:29:48,707 --> 02:29:49,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Peggle?

2074
02:29:50,168 --> 02:29:50,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Peggle.

2075
02:29:50,888 --> 02:29:52,830
[SPEAKER_03]: A bunch of music-making software would be good.

2076
02:29:53,170 --> 02:29:53,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Mario Paint?

2077
02:29:53,871 --> 02:29:54,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2078
02:29:55,152 --> 02:29:56,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me put it this way, though.

2079
02:29:56,072 --> 02:30:02,697
[SPEAKER_02]: The Commodore 64 would probably have more applications than an Apple PC or an Apple computer.

2080
02:30:02,918 --> 02:30:04,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it would be backwards compatible.

2081
02:30:04,999 --> 02:30:09,022
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's get to the listless results tonight.

2082
02:30:09,042 --> 02:30:10,764
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do the listless results.

2083
02:30:11,240 --> 02:30:11,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Play the music!

2084
02:30:30,259 --> 02:30:30,920
[SPEAKER_03]: for third place.

2085
02:30:31,240 --> 02:30:34,002
[SPEAKER_03]: A tie for the number three thing you most want to see Microsoft improve on.

2086
02:30:34,042 --> 02:30:34,803
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, this is it.

2087
02:30:35,063 --> 02:30:36,064
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no arguing.

2088
02:30:36,284 --> 02:30:37,966
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a very scientific process.

2089
02:30:38,506 --> 02:30:40,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Microsoft, if you're listening, here it is.

2090
02:30:41,088 --> 02:30:44,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Number three, the masses want Pokemans.

2091
02:30:44,891 --> 02:30:47,013
[SPEAKER_03]: They want you to take the Pokemans and make them better.

2092
02:30:48,154 --> 02:30:54,419
[SPEAKER_03]: And tied with that, you might have to fry those Pokemans in the Colonel's Secret Recipe because you've got to make that better too.

2093
02:30:54,500 --> 02:30:58,123
[SPEAKER_03]: The Colonel's Recipe and Pokemans tying for third place tonight.

2094
02:30:59,568 --> 02:31:05,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Second place tonight, Visual Memory Cards is what they want you to steal and make better.

2095
02:31:05,311 --> 02:31:06,251
[SPEAKER_03]: VMUs.

2096
02:31:06,651 --> 02:31:08,212
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to take those and make them better.

2097
02:31:09,312 --> 02:31:17,576
[SPEAKER_03]: And lastly, the number one thing that Microsoft needs to steal and make better, the PSP, a handheld system.

2098
02:31:17,616 --> 02:31:18,116
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

2099
02:31:18,636 --> 02:31:23,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Microsoft, we want a handheld system as voted by our chatters.

2100
02:31:23,298 --> 02:31:23,639
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

2101
02:31:23,699 --> 02:31:24,199
[SPEAKER_03]: No arguing.

2102
02:31:24,539 --> 02:31:24,899
[SPEAKER_03]: We're done.

2103
02:31:25,239 --> 02:31:26,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Windows Mobile, not going to cut it.

2104
02:31:27,581 --> 02:31:29,663
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to steal the PSP and make it better.

2105
02:31:30,524 --> 02:31:32,226
[SPEAKER_03]: There are two parts to this tonight.

2106
02:31:32,667 --> 02:31:39,695
[SPEAKER_03]: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 people want the beta, oh no, 11 people want the beta code.

2107
02:31:41,317 --> 02:31:44,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan, pick a number between 1 and 11 if you wouldn't mind.

2108
02:31:45,458 --> 02:31:46,439
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2109
02:32:04,974 --> 02:32:12,059
[SPEAKER_03]: 8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

2110
02:32:08,276 --> 02:32:12,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Amaze Satsuma wins a Blur Beta Code.

2111
02:32:12,099 --> 02:32:13,900
[SPEAKER_03]: So congratulations to you guys.

2112
02:32:14,500 --> 02:32:17,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to everyone else, but there it is.

2113
02:32:17,102 --> 02:32:21,985
[SPEAKER_03]: So Llama Juice and Amaze Satsuma win Beta Codes just for voting and participating in the show tonight.

2114
02:32:22,325 --> 02:32:28,609
[SPEAKER_03]: You can too, Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right at AllGamesRadio, AllGames.com.

2115
02:32:29,509 --> 02:32:40,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we're going to get to the Skype line in a minute, although I was hoping to speak to Aaron, but I closed the number with his phone number.

2116
02:32:46,746 --> 02:32:52,649
[SPEAKER_03]: When I was tallying all the votes, I closed the window with his number, so now I'm waiting for it.

2117
02:32:53,209 --> 02:32:54,510
[SPEAKER_03]: So there it is.

2118
02:32:54,690 --> 02:32:56,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I need to send those codes.

2119
02:32:56,331 --> 02:32:57,492
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to send those codes.

2120
02:32:57,912 --> 02:33:02,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, do you have any quick last-minute stories to work in here while I wait to hopefully hear from Aaron?

2121
02:33:03,074 --> 02:33:06,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Alan Wake, several download content episodes are due out this year.

2122
02:33:07,696 --> 02:33:12,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Second season possibly available depending on the audience.

2123
02:33:12,057 --> 02:33:17,699
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they buy it or not or how well the first season does.

2124
02:33:18,539 --> 02:33:19,119
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of neat.

2125
02:33:19,219 --> 02:33:21,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of reminds me of what they're doing with Heavy Rain.

2126
02:33:21,500 --> 02:33:23,921
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be releasing some download content seasons for that.

2127
02:33:24,421 --> 02:33:30,503
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course the game is set to hit shelves on May 18th on the Xbox 360.

2128
02:33:33,522 --> 02:33:37,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.

2129
02:33:38,683 --> 02:33:46,024
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what they're doing with this, but their casting apparently has been released for the Kane and Lynch film.

2130
02:33:46,764 --> 02:33:50,065
[SPEAKER_02]: And Kane, pretty cool.

2131
02:33:50,085 --> 02:33:53,245
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to have Bruce Willis to play Kane.

2132
02:33:53,986 --> 02:34:01,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Lynch, however, is being played by Jamie Foxx, who I might add looks absolutely nothing like the character of Lynch.

2133
02:34:04,992 --> 02:34:05,713
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a good actor, though.

2134
02:34:05,793 --> 02:34:14,863
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you think about it, not to be all racist or anything, but a black man playing a character named Lynch is a little weird, if you ask me.

2135
02:34:15,824 --> 02:34:16,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

2136
02:34:16,725 --> 02:34:17,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

2137
02:34:17,666 --> 02:34:19,328
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no response for that at all.

2138
02:34:20,129 --> 02:34:21,310
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying, okay?

2139
02:34:21,490 --> 02:34:23,753
[SPEAKER_02]: But seriously, though, Jamie Foxx, great actor.

2140
02:34:24,233 --> 02:34:26,154
[SPEAKER_02]: But he looks nothing like the character.

2141
02:34:26,654 --> 02:34:29,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Billy Bob Thornton looks more like the character, I think.

2142
02:34:29,396 --> 02:34:30,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, he's a horrible actor.

2143
02:34:31,437 --> 02:34:33,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at least now he's a horrible actor.

2144
02:34:33,157 --> 02:34:38,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think, you know, with makeup and so forth, they'll give him the mullet and the glasses and everything he needs.

2145
02:34:38,500 --> 02:34:40,881
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's gonna look weird in the mullet and glasses.

2146
02:34:40,941 --> 02:34:44,863
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he's... It's a different race.

2147
02:34:44,983 --> 02:34:48,825
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like as bad as the whole Chung-Li thing in the last Street Fighter movie.

2148
02:34:49,813 --> 02:35:15,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Not Asian, doesn't look anything like Chung Li Oh, and can't act By the way, BondsS006 in chat says I am black myself and I say no And to what Loki said, yes, yes, yes Same thing ran through my head, WTF So maybe Loki is not as insensitive as we all think Every time I see the Prince of Persia trailer With Jake Gyllenhaal in the movie theater Every time I see that trailer, I just want to scream out He's white!

2149
02:35:15,722 --> 02:35:19,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Like to the theater Just, yeah You should

2150
02:35:20,768 --> 02:35:26,510
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to add, this is completely off topic here, but they finally released the riff tracks for the new Twilight movie.

2151
02:35:27,090 --> 02:35:28,771
[SPEAKER_02]: I am very excited to watch that.

2152
02:35:29,711 --> 02:35:33,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I'm excited to watch the Twilight movies, but the riff tracks were fucking hilarious.

2153
02:35:34,152 --> 02:35:35,493
[SPEAKER_02]: And we watched it with The Happening.

2154
02:35:35,913 --> 02:35:39,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, completely different movie watching that.

2155
02:35:39,434 --> 02:35:42,175
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just ridiculously funny.

2156
02:35:46,460 --> 02:35:47,400
[SPEAKER_02]: No phone number yet.

2157
02:35:47,460 --> 02:35:48,020
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I got it.

2158
02:35:48,040 --> 02:35:48,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I got it.

2159
02:35:48,420 --> 02:35:48,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

2160
02:35:48,780 --> 02:35:51,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just waiting for the conversation to finish because good times.

2161
02:35:51,481 --> 02:35:53,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it when you say things that will get you in trouble.

2162
02:35:53,621 --> 02:35:53,901
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2163
02:35:53,961 --> 02:36:02,443
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to give our good buddy Aaron, also known as YYR, a call because he has a brand new game on the Xbox Live Marketplace in the indie game section.

2164
02:36:02,743 --> 02:36:03,923
[SPEAKER_03]: And we want to talk to him about it.

2165
02:36:03,963 --> 02:36:05,383
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's get him on the line.

2166
02:36:07,104 --> 02:36:09,004
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to call him on our Skype line right now.

2167
02:36:09,024 --> 02:36:11,724
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll open up the Skype line for anybody to call in at 1-877-GAME.

2168
02:36:12,905 --> 02:36:14,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Aaron, how you doing?

2169
02:36:15,143 --> 02:36:15,924
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured it was you.

2170
02:36:16,044 --> 02:36:16,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, how'd you know?

2171
02:36:17,025 --> 02:36:21,208
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't just the whole back and forth about he ran off to get a drink at just the wrong moment.

2172
02:36:21,748 --> 02:36:22,589
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing, Aaron?

2173
02:36:22,629 --> 02:36:24,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations, you released a game tonight.

2174
02:36:25,531 --> 02:36:32,217
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing okay, which is pretty cool considering this has been a bumpy ride.

2175
02:36:32,377 --> 02:36:41,404
[SPEAKER_01]: Losing power from last Saturday night through this Thursday evening and basically shacking up with my parents and doing all that I could from there.

2176
02:36:42,483 --> 02:36:49,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Working on convention crap for most of the weekend And now I think I'm coming down with a cold Oh goody, now that's right, you're going to be at PAX East, right?

2177
02:36:50,725 --> 02:36:54,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're showing off Snake 360 in your latest game at a booth there?

2178
02:36:55,627 --> 02:37:10,451
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have all four of my games Three of them will have been released up to that point And the fourth I thought would probably have been released But it's failed review on a technicality Uh oh

2179
02:37:11,354 --> 02:37:14,317
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming soon, and you get to play it first.

2180
02:37:14,337 --> 02:37:14,838
[SPEAKER_01]: How cool is that?

2181
02:37:26,351 --> 02:37:26,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, there you go.

2182
02:37:26,911 --> 02:37:30,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, that's some reason why people want to go to PAX is to play the games first.

2183
02:37:30,554 --> 02:37:33,436
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, Ziba in our chat room is suggesting take some Airborne.

2184
02:37:33,596 --> 02:37:35,117
[SPEAKER_03]: But SH100Matt says it doesn't work.

2185
02:37:35,297 --> 02:37:36,038
[SPEAKER_03]: So, vitamins.

2186
02:37:36,158 --> 02:37:38,940
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, let's talk about your latest game.

2187
02:37:38,960 --> 02:37:42,202
[SPEAKER_03]: So tonight on Xbox Live Marketplace, you released a game called Falling.

2188
02:37:42,543 --> 02:37:44,404
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a little clip so you can hear some of the music.

2189
02:37:46,966 --> 02:37:47,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that sounds familiar.

2190
02:37:47,826 --> 02:37:51,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, basically what it kind of is, is it's a puzzle-type game at its core.

2191
02:38:12,509 --> 02:38:13,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn that walrus!

2192
02:38:29,461 --> 02:38:36,984
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you need to do is clean up the mess and then crush Wally before he causes trouble, which of course is touching you, you die.

2193
02:38:37,644 --> 02:38:40,685
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, at first also Wally starts off stupid.

2194
02:38:40,705 --> 02:38:45,206
[SPEAKER_01]: He just kind of walks back and forth and waits for you to crush him, either by pushing a block on him or...

2195
02:38:45,666 --> 02:38:57,912
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, dropping it on his head or whatever, but then later on he can push blocks around, he can jump over things, he can kick blocks at your face, you know, just generally make life miserable for you.

2196
02:38:58,593 --> 02:39:04,456
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you gotta get rid of him and you also have to clear the blocks by throwing or kicking the same colored blocks into each other.

2197
02:39:05,176 --> 02:39:14,621
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you're matching colors, you're avoiding walking walruses and, you know, just generally things get pretty chaotic later in the game and

2198
02:39:15,177 --> 02:39:22,142
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun, it's got the retro vibe, and it plays a lot like a frenetic arcade experience.

2199
02:39:22,803 --> 02:39:30,868
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to compare it to something like Bubble Bobble, where it starts off simple and then it gets very complex and very action-packed.

2200
02:39:32,189 --> 02:39:38,614
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel it does have the kind of lasting enjoyment that a game like that used to have.

2201
02:39:39,474 --> 02:39:41,476
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I pretty much captured that spirit.

2202
02:39:41,846 --> 02:39:45,188
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely looks like something that could be from Game Room.

2203
02:39:45,288 --> 02:39:48,370
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of that old, kind of retro look to it.

2204
02:39:48,430 --> 02:39:51,712
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like this game is coming out just in time, honestly, for everything.

2205
02:39:52,433 --> 02:39:55,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, I mean, I hope people download it and they...

2206
02:39:56,360 --> 02:40:00,922
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they get the same kind of feelings that they get when they play one of their favorite old games.

2207
02:40:01,582 --> 02:40:03,123
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I hope they buy it.

2208
02:40:04,584 --> 02:40:06,264
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can't get the trial in the marketplace right now.

2209
02:40:06,284 --> 02:40:10,226
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go ahead and let the... Oh, you have several videos up here on YouTube, don't you?

2210
02:40:10,266 --> 02:40:12,227
[SPEAKER_03]: You have, like, an attract mode, some other gameplay clips.

2211
02:40:12,747 --> 02:40:15,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's try one of these other clips here on the YouTube.

2212
02:40:15,709 --> 02:40:17,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, you posted some clips of the game.

2213
02:40:17,149 --> 02:40:19,490
[SPEAKER_03]: This is round 10 we're going to look at now.

2214
02:40:19,530 --> 02:40:21,792
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm imagining things get a little more intense in this level.

2215
02:40:21,812 --> 02:40:22,632
[SPEAKER_03]: The bricks fall faster.

2216
02:40:22,652 --> 02:40:22,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

2217
02:40:23,012 --> 02:40:27,455
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I was playing on hard difficulty when I made that video, so it's kind of nuts.

2218
02:40:28,036 --> 02:40:30,938
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think, I think that video ends with my death, actually.

2219
02:40:31,678 --> 02:40:33,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, there's multiple, there's wal-rye.

2220
02:40:34,060 --> 02:40:35,281
[SPEAKER_03]: There's multiple walrus.

2221
02:40:35,881 --> 02:40:36,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Walruses.

2222
02:40:36,662 --> 02:40:38,062
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, they come in packs.

2223
02:40:38,423 --> 02:40:39,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my gosh.

2224
02:40:39,043 --> 02:40:40,064
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like real walruses.

2225
02:40:40,284 --> 02:40:42,946
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I'm not basing that statement on any fact whatsoever.

2226
02:40:43,436 --> 02:40:44,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I've got to ask you.

2227
02:40:44,456 --> 02:40:45,996
[SPEAKER_03]: This seems like the most obvious question.

2228
02:40:46,577 --> 02:40:49,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Where did the inspiration for a game like this come from?

2229
02:40:49,917 --> 02:40:52,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Did this come to you in a dream or something?

2230
02:40:52,098 --> 02:40:56,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Little Penguin's going to get his home invaded by walruses.

2231
02:40:56,678 --> 02:40:58,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Where the hell did you come up with this?

2232
02:40:59,499 --> 02:41:10,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, to be completely honest, the entire concept for the game started with my, I guess now, ex-fiance's obsession with Piplup.

2233
02:41:12,285 --> 02:41:13,905
[SPEAKER_01]: That is completely true.

2234
02:41:14,666 --> 02:41:17,106
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to make a game with a penguin in it.

2235
02:41:17,966 --> 02:41:20,287
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, okay, blocks are falling from the ceiling.

2236
02:41:20,807 --> 02:41:23,748
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I thought, okay, something has to come and be an antagonist.

2237
02:41:24,208 --> 02:41:30,089
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, I figured, well, you know, I think I heard somewhere that walruses in real life don't like penguins.

2238
02:41:30,609 --> 02:41:31,910
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started going with that.

2239
02:41:32,270 --> 02:41:36,451
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I had already drawn all the sprites, I decided to actually look this up.

2240
02:41:36,991 --> 02:41:41,672
[SPEAKER_01]: And according to stuff I found on Wikipedia, the simple fact of the matter is

2241
02:41:42,395 --> 02:41:49,200
[SPEAKER_01]: So you found out that walruses and penguins were like mortal enemies and you're like, there's a game there.

2242
02:41:55,958 --> 02:41:57,699
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what I was going for.

2243
02:42:20,485 --> 02:42:32,536
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally just basically wanted to make it feel like an old arcade game.

2244
02:42:32,876 --> 02:42:46,107
[SPEAKER_01]: From the moment you power up the machine and you see the ROM test and it puts the option settings on the screen for a fraction of a second to going into the options and being able to adjust how many coins the game costs.

2245
02:42:46,227 --> 02:42:46,908
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all in there.

2246
02:42:47,239 --> 02:42:47,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

2247
02:42:47,899 --> 02:42:49,379
[SPEAKER_03]: But no real coins.

2248
02:42:49,900 --> 02:42:54,201
[SPEAKER_03]: It's much different than Game Room, where Game Room charges you 50 cents a play, but that won't happen here, right?

2249
02:42:55,161 --> 02:42:55,741
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.

2250
02:42:55,801 --> 02:42:58,161
[SPEAKER_01]: You can try it for free, just like all indie games.

2251
02:42:58,742 --> 02:43:05,823
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you spend 80 space bucks, just 80 space bucks, you can play it as much as you want for as long as you want.

2252
02:43:07,624 --> 02:43:09,344
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I caught, how many space bucks was that?

2253
02:43:10,530 --> 02:43:13,051
[SPEAKER_03]: 80.

2254
02:43:11,770 --> 02:43:13,051
[SPEAKER_03]: $1.

2255
02:43:12,311 --> 02:43:13,051
[SPEAKER_03]: $1?

2256
02:43:12,531 --> 02:43:13,051
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a steal.

2257
02:43:13,091 --> 02:43:13,471
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

2258
02:43:13,871 --> 02:43:14,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, what is this?

2259
02:43:14,491 --> 02:43:25,034
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed, I just caught this briefly at the end of the attract screen here, that when it's showing the high score table, it looks like the default scores say, import Futari now?

2260
02:43:25,094 --> 02:43:25,634
[SPEAKER_03]: What is that?

2261
02:43:26,955 --> 02:43:27,755
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nothing.

2262
02:43:28,675 --> 02:43:34,777
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's a direct reference to Mushihime Sama Futari, the cave shooting game released last year.

2263
02:43:36,020 --> 02:43:43,024
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, there's another game that I'm releasing soon called Sharpshooter, and I make a reference to DJ Max Technica and its high score tables.

2264
02:43:43,804 --> 02:43:47,747
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all about referencing other games, other stuff.

2265
02:43:48,787 --> 02:44:00,333
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, before we end this conversation, I would like to actually directly reference one of the in-game references that I have actually in all my games, and I'm turning that into a giveaway for three of our chat roomers.

2266
02:44:02,495 --> 02:44:08,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so what, the chatters have to know what it is that all your games have in common, or what's the deal?

2267
02:44:10,178 --> 02:44:11,258
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, do you want to do it now?

2268
02:44:11,578 --> 02:44:12,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, why not?

2269
02:44:13,839 --> 02:44:28,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, in every game that I've released so far, Snake360, Card Arcade, Falling, and also in the game that I'm releasing next month, Sharpshooter, and by the way, all those games will be on display at PAX East, and I hope that

2270
02:44:29,392 --> 02:44:33,735
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone who comes to PAX East will come to our booth and have a really great time.

2271
02:44:34,095 --> 02:44:41,020
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be next to Mommy's Best Games, and they're going to have a bunch of great stuff too, including an unreleased game called Grapple Buggy.

2272
02:44:41,760 --> 02:44:44,782
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, come, play the games.

2273
02:44:45,062 --> 02:44:48,545
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be running Snake360 tournaments all weekend long.

2274
02:44:48,905 --> 02:44:52,327
[SPEAKER_01]: You can compete for prizes, t-shirts, soundtrack CDs.

2275
02:44:52,407 --> 02:44:54,428
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I decided to go all out with this.

2276
02:44:55,089 --> 02:44:55,249
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

2277
02:44:56,138 --> 02:45:11,729
[SPEAKER_03]: But at any rate, no, it's not OL or G related Thank you, chat But I will absolutely stop by the booth Absolutely, I'll be stopping by to say hello I am looking forward to meeting you Absolutely, I'll be by I don't know what I'm wearing yet Everybody's asking me, what are you wearing?

2278
02:45:11,769 --> 02:45:20,435
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can spot you and see you I don't know I was hoping to have my frilly orange scarf But it looks like I'll have to save that for PAX Prime

2279
02:45:20,655 --> 02:45:22,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, I have this thing called homework.

2280
02:45:22,696 --> 02:45:23,176
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

2281
02:45:23,256 --> 02:45:24,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Bakers can't be choosers.

2282
02:45:24,657 --> 02:45:26,378
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll find something creative.

2283
02:45:26,398 --> 02:45:29,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know my friend Amanda plans to wear a corset one day.

2284
02:45:29,679 --> 02:45:31,080
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was thinking, well, I could wear a corset.

2285
02:45:31,500 --> 02:45:32,720
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know how well that would go over.

2286
02:45:32,820 --> 02:45:34,361
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll have to see.

2287
02:45:35,261 --> 02:45:36,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay tuned to the Twitter, folks.

2288
02:45:36,562 --> 02:45:37,022
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let you know.

2289
02:45:38,183 --> 02:45:38,503
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

2290
02:45:38,523 --> 02:45:40,144
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, back to the giveaway.

2291
02:45:40,184 --> 02:45:40,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

2292
02:45:42,463 --> 02:45:48,890
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in all of the games that I have released or am releasing, I have a number in there.

2293
02:45:49,111 --> 02:45:55,438
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually in the form of one of the high score numbers, and it's a direct reference to a video game company.

2294
02:45:56,339 --> 02:46:01,466
[SPEAKER_01]: The first three people to type it into chat get a code to download following for free.

2295
02:46:02,028 --> 02:46:02,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Woohoo!

2296
02:46:03,168 --> 02:46:04,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Free falling.

2297
02:46:04,249 --> 02:46:08,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Save that dollar by typing that number into chat right now.

2298
02:46:08,791 --> 02:46:09,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the number.

2299
02:46:10,071 --> 02:46:11,352
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need the number.

2300
02:46:11,392 --> 02:46:13,353
[SPEAKER_01]: I need the video game company that I referenced.

2301
02:46:13,393 --> 02:46:14,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Oops, my bad.

2302
02:46:14,093 --> 02:46:14,733
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not Konami.

2303
02:46:15,134 --> 02:46:15,554
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

2304
02:46:15,594 --> 02:46:20,076
[SPEAKER_03]: The video game company he references and he flat out has told you it is not Konami.

2305
02:46:20,736 --> 02:46:22,156
[SPEAKER_03]: So go ahead and guess.

2306
02:46:22,236 --> 02:46:22,717
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.

2307
02:46:22,737 --> 02:46:23,317
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?

2308
02:46:23,997 --> 02:46:24,577
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?

2309
02:46:25,638 --> 02:46:28,739
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm not seeing it yet, so I'm just going to say what the number is.

2310
02:46:29,059 --> 02:46:29,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2311
02:46:29,399 --> 02:46:29,560
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 765-

2312
02:46:32,475 --> 02:46:42,201
[SPEAKER_03]: 765 It's not Konami, it's not Bungie I see it, I'm waiting for two other people to say it before I confirm it What's the list of what it's not?

2313
02:46:42,381 --> 02:46:46,344
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not Konami, and the number is 765

2314
02:46:57,392 --> 02:47:15,295
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, three people wrote Namco, we're done Oh, Namco, tell us a little more about the reference to Namco Yes, I'm basically a Namco fangirl So many of Namco's games are on my all-time list of favorites that I couldn't possibly not be a Namco fangirl

2315
02:47:16,253 --> 02:47:19,075
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm basically referencing them in, well, everything.

2316
02:47:32,661 --> 02:47:37,367
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize for the listeners that have heard this story 5,000 times, but you know I love this story.

2317
02:47:37,968 --> 02:47:45,737
[SPEAKER_03]: In the Namco PS3 game, the Namco Treasures Volume 1, there is a direct OLR reference in your face.

2318
02:47:45,757 --> 02:47:46,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

2319
02:47:46,077 --> 02:47:46,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, when

2320
02:47:47,619 --> 02:47:48,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki

2321
02:48:07,800 --> 02:48:34,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wow, I gotta go run and check that right now No kidding, it's on the PS3 and it's the Namco Treasures Volume 1 It's the one that has like Pac-Man and all that stuff I think I actually downloaded that I don't know if I still have it on the hard drive But if not, I'm getting it again But it's not in the demo, I just want to make that clear You will not see it in the demo, that splash screen is only in the full version Because the way the PS3 works is funky Your demo is like completely separate from your regular game It's not like the 360 where you upgrade I'm not happy about it either

2322
02:48:35,638 --> 02:48:50,786
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah so again if you hadn't heard that story before I love that story so much I totally support that yeah it's that's when you know you made it we've been doing this show for eight years to get our name in a video game was amazing so we were very happy about that

2323
02:48:51,305 --> 02:48:53,367
[SPEAKER_03]: I started falling, I'd say probably around September or October of last year

2324
02:49:14,228 --> 02:49:40,048
[SPEAKER_01]: and now granted I was working on Sharpshooter which is my release for next month at the same time and by the way if you're developing a game I would very very strongly recommend that you never ever try to work on two at the same time because as with most things it'll probably wind up taking you longer you know to finish both than if you just did one and then the other but yeah it does take a while because you know it's

2325
02:49:40,433 --> 02:49:41,234
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2326
02:50:02,905 --> 02:50:07,051
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I say to people, people really just don't realize how much time goes into a game.

2327
02:50:07,072 --> 02:50:17,988
[SPEAKER_01]: The next time you're walking through a 3D environment in a first-person shooter, don't just run past that intricately designed building and never look at it again.

2328
02:50:19,106 --> 02:50:27,930
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually take the time to look at it and admire what a bunch of designers worked on because they spent hours on that and we run past it in five seconds.

2329
02:50:28,870 --> 02:50:32,012
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing all the detail that goes into that type of work.

2330
02:50:32,052 --> 02:50:32,852
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like a movie.

2331
02:50:32,932 --> 02:50:37,334
[SPEAKER_03]: The list of credits at the end of the movie, it really does take that many people to make a movie.

2332
02:50:37,594 --> 02:50:39,975
[SPEAKER_03]: But this game, Falling, was made by one guy.

2333
02:50:41,280 --> 02:50:42,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's me.

2334
02:50:42,100 --> 02:50:42,360
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope so too.

2335
02:50:42,380 --> 02:50:44,041
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember the three lucky winners.

2336
02:50:44,061 --> 02:50:44,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch your PMs.

2337
02:51:07,713 --> 02:51:12,358
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just looking to get my name out there and maybe make enough to someday do this for a living.

2338
02:51:12,378 --> 02:51:13,219
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.

2339
02:51:13,620 --> 02:51:15,502
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not looking to make a fortune or anything.

2340
02:51:16,503 --> 02:51:17,925
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like a fair compromise.

2341
02:51:17,985 --> 02:51:19,266
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you at PAX East, Aaron.

2342
02:51:20,447 --> 02:51:21,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Alrighty, see you there.

2343
02:51:21,448 --> 02:51:24,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'll probably be assaulting you with a microphone there too, just so you know.

2344
02:51:24,652 --> 02:51:25,733
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just fine.

2345
02:51:25,793 --> 02:51:26,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, good luck.

2346
02:51:26,514 --> 02:51:26,995
[SPEAKER_03]: See you at the show.

2347
02:51:28,123 --> 02:51:28,583
[SPEAKER_01]: See you later

2348
02:51:57,635 --> 02:52:21,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I think is kind of interesting So yeah, that's very cool So congratulations to Derek on that accomplishment Who knows, maybe Falling being a retro game could be next Who knows, we'll see I don't know if that'll open the floodgates But congrats to all of our friends that are indie developers Man, it takes a lot of work I wish I had that kind of talent I would make an OLR game, I think that would be fun But we'll see Alright, are we ready to go to the phones and take some calls tonight?

2349
02:52:22,952 --> 02:52:24,134
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2350
02:52:41,496 --> 02:52:42,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Power Gig Rise of the Six String

2351
02:52:57,719 --> 02:52:59,820
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2352
02:53:22,972 --> 02:53:23,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I did.

2353
02:53:23,914 --> 02:53:24,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Have fun with that.

2354
02:53:24,916 --> 02:53:25,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck with that.

2355
02:53:25,657 --> 02:53:25,897
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2356
02:53:25,937 --> 02:53:30,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully your video doesn't screw up our bandwidth, but we'll see what happens.

2357
02:53:30,966 --> 02:53:31,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.

2358
02:53:31,186 --> 02:53:31,667
[SPEAKER_03]: He shut it off.

2359
02:53:31,687 --> 02:53:31,888
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2360
02:53:31,908 --> 02:53:32,208
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

2361
02:53:32,549 --> 02:53:32,869
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up?

2362
02:53:33,130 --> 02:53:33,651
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, Lama Juice?

2363
02:53:33,671 --> 02:53:34,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry about that.

2364
02:53:34,152 --> 02:53:34,713
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's okay.

2365
02:53:34,833 --> 02:53:35,173
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool.

2366
02:53:35,474 --> 02:53:35,895
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

2367
02:53:37,376 --> 02:53:42,298
[SPEAKER_05]: I went down to GDC in San Francisco last week-ish.

2368
02:53:42,698 --> 02:53:42,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2369
02:53:43,778 --> 02:53:51,421
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know if you guys – I got to the show late last week, so I didn't get to hear about anything you guys were talking about.

2370
02:53:51,721 --> 02:53:58,223
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we didn't go to the show, which is funny because we're not that – you must be in the area because we're just in Sacramento, so we're not that far from San Francisco.

2371
02:53:58,263 --> 02:54:03,145
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, Alan is from there, so I go there all of the time, and I was there that weekend.

2372
02:54:03,205 --> 02:54:06,466
[SPEAKER_03]: But GDC, they don't really let media people in.

2373
02:54:06,946 --> 02:54:07,907
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't go.

2374
02:54:09,048 --> 02:54:11,570
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually do have media passes.

2375
02:54:11,710 --> 02:54:12,931
[SPEAKER_05]: You should try that next time.

2376
02:54:12,991 --> 02:54:16,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but unfortunately, it's kind of one of those double-edged swords.

2377
02:54:16,694 --> 02:54:21,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Indie podcasters aren't really media enough for them.

2378
02:54:21,497 --> 02:54:22,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.

2379
02:54:22,218 --> 02:54:27,242
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to work for IGN or, well, I guess the media passes will be opening up next time.

2380
02:54:27,722 --> 02:54:28,022
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2381
02:54:29,203 --> 02:54:30,504
[SPEAKER_03]: So how was GDC?

2382
02:54:30,524 --> 02:54:31,005
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you think?

2383
02:54:32,396 --> 02:55:00,053
[SPEAKER_05]: um the conference itself was really awesome I'm an environment artist trying to get a job so for to go there it was basically a giant job fair you know with all the big companies and what not trying to hire people um but what was neat is that like all of the all of the different like Sony and Microsoft had booths there too showing off all their stuff and uh

2384
02:55:01,650 --> 02:55:04,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony was showing off their PlayStation Move.

2385
02:55:04,391 --> 02:55:05,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you get your hands on it?

2386
02:55:06,373 --> 02:55:06,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2387
02:55:07,293 --> 02:55:08,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, I want to know what you thought then.

2388
02:55:08,954 --> 02:55:10,335
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely want to know what you thought of Move.

2389
02:55:12,055 --> 02:55:14,697
[SPEAKER_05]: I was out opening day picking up the Wii.

2390
02:55:14,717 --> 02:55:16,858
[SPEAKER_05]: I was out there waiting outside for 14 hours.

2391
02:55:17,939 --> 02:55:21,741
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Move puts the Wii to shame, hands down.

2392
02:55:22,421 --> 02:55:23,421
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, that's a pretty bold statement.

2393
02:55:23,501 --> 02:55:26,803
[SPEAKER_05]: The controls for it were extremely responsive.

2394
02:55:26,823 --> 02:55:28,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2395
02:55:29,651 --> 02:55:35,934
[SPEAKER_05]: The demos that they showed were, it was a lot of really, really cheesy stuff.

2396
02:55:35,994 --> 02:55:41,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there was a little game where you made bubbles and a monkey tried to pop the bubbles.

2397
02:55:42,737 --> 02:55:52,542
[SPEAKER_05]: But as far as the controlling of it all went, it was very one-to-one, very, very quick and responsive.

2398
02:55:53,142 --> 02:55:56,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that all you played was the monkey bubble game or were there other stuff that you got to check out?

2399
02:55:57,426 --> 02:55:58,947
[SPEAKER_05]: There was the Monkey Bubble game.

2400
02:55:59,267 --> 02:56:04,291
[SPEAKER_05]: There was that tech demo that they showed at E3 right when they showed it off.

2401
02:56:04,331 --> 02:56:05,092
[SPEAKER_05]: They had that there.

2402
02:56:06,173 --> 02:56:14,459
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they had some other game that I watched some girl play where she was swinging some swords and mallets or something around.

2403
02:56:15,500 --> 02:56:17,641
[SPEAKER_05]: And she was getting really into it.

2404
02:56:17,722 --> 02:56:22,585
[SPEAKER_05]: And it looked like it was very responsive as to what she was doing and all that.

2405
02:56:22,605 --> 02:56:23,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2406
02:56:24,807 --> 02:56:32,947
[SPEAKER_05]: They were showing that if you have the two controllers, the camera itself can actually do face tracking as well.

2407
02:56:34,264 --> 02:56:55,067
[SPEAKER_05]: and so the camera can see your face and the two remotes and then guess where your arms are and all that and so it tries to do sensing where your body is and so if you're ducking and stuff like that it can try to replicate that with a character on screen.

2408
02:56:55,447 --> 02:56:56,508
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2409
02:57:15,658 --> 02:57:27,941
[SPEAKER_03]: although, you know, I think we all see it as a logical step for Sony and we all know they've had more time now to perfect the technology, so it better be better but the big question is does it have the games to substantiate it?

2410
02:57:27,981 --> 02:57:32,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, if it's just another bunch of little mini party games and so forth, then what's the point?

2411
02:57:33,062 --> 02:57:44,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think, from what you observed, that Move has the, let's just go back to the old OLR golden rule a video game system is only as good as the games that are on it Do you think that

2412
02:57:45,385 --> 02:57:48,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Move has the games to substantiate the controller.

2413
02:57:50,310 --> 02:57:58,216
[SPEAKER_05]: From what they showed at GDC, they really only showed one game, like one full game with it, and I didn't really see much of it.

2414
02:57:58,797 --> 02:58:10,627
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was talking to the guy that, like the main guy behind the whole technology of it all, and he was saying that the new SOCOM that's going to be coming out is going to be using it very in-depth.

2415
02:58:11,987 --> 02:58:17,588
[SPEAKER_05]: and so he's saying that the controls for that are going to be pretty sweet.

2416
02:58:18,408 --> 02:58:23,329
[SPEAKER_05]: So if SOCOM's going to be using it, I guess that's a really big title for Sony.

2417
02:58:24,770 --> 02:58:28,811
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have a PS3, so I don't know.

2418
02:58:29,671 --> 02:58:35,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Then even better, is this the type of peripheral that makes you want to get one?

2419
02:58:36,670 --> 02:58:37,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of.

2420
02:58:37,691 --> 02:58:41,353
[SPEAKER_05]: I've always been a sucker for the gimmicky crap in games.

2421
02:58:41,673 --> 02:58:49,918
[SPEAKER_05]: I got the Game Boy printer, the e-reader, I bought the Wii opening day, all that kind of stuff.

2422
02:58:50,779 --> 02:58:57,022
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this kind of thing, it does make me want to buy a PS3.

2423
02:58:59,024 --> 02:59:00,785
[SPEAKER_05]: The guy said that...

2424
02:59:02,043 --> 02:59:11,288
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as prices, the unit's going to come out with a controller, a game, and the camera all under $100 when it comes out.

2425
02:59:11,508 --> 02:59:12,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I remember that.

2426
02:59:12,109 --> 02:59:14,510
[SPEAKER_03]: They did have a little press conference where they said some of that.

2427
02:59:14,570 --> 02:59:17,792
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I wonder if it's going to be the Monkey Bubble game or what it's going to be.

2428
02:59:19,293 --> 02:59:19,913
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.

2429
02:59:20,353 --> 02:59:28,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, real quickly, before we let you go, because we want to get at least one more call tonight, were there any other quick thoughts you had about GDC or something really interesting?

2430
02:59:28,965 --> 02:59:34,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you attend any panels or seminars or what have you that you just thought were awesome that you want to share?

2431
02:59:36,028 --> 02:59:56,583
[SPEAKER_05]: um sadly I didn't get to go to any of the they call them summits there um I didn't get to go to any of those because I got the cheap pass which was still $250 right oh wow plus I live in Orlando so uh I didn't really have the extra oh you came all the way out here just for that then wow cool

2432
02:59:57,321 --> 02:59:57,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

2433
02:59:59,102 --> 03:00:03,086
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I will say is, if you don't mind a little plug here.

2434
03:00:03,246 --> 03:00:04,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

2435
03:00:04,807 --> 03:00:12,273
[SPEAKER_05]: I did a vlog every day as I was out there, recorded anything fun that I saw at the expo.

2436
03:00:13,013 --> 03:00:19,678
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to see any of that, I have a YouTube channel, youtube.com slash llama juice, all one word.

2437
03:00:19,698 --> 03:00:21,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2438
03:00:22,276 --> 03:00:26,178
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you go there, you can see a lot of the cool stuff they had at the expo.

2439
03:00:26,298 --> 03:00:36,644
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a lot of virtual reality stuff going on, a lot of 3D glasses with gaming, a lot of stuff like that going on.

2440
03:00:36,664 --> 03:00:39,245
[SPEAKER_05]: It was some pretty cool technology going on there.

2441
03:00:39,648 --> 03:00:41,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so check that out on YouTube.

2442
03:00:42,029 --> 03:00:48,352
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go ahead and let you plug that, especially because we weren't out there ourselves, so I might actually be going to look and see what it was like out there on the show floor.

2443
03:00:48,813 --> 03:00:56,456
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Lama Juice, good luck with Blur, good luck with your schooling for all the environmental stuff, and we'll see you later on the show, okay?

2444
03:00:57,937 --> 03:00:58,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like a plan.

2445
03:00:58,677 --> 03:00:59,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, take care, buddy.

2446
03:01:00,609 --> 03:01:01,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, you too.

2447
03:01:01,790 --> 03:01:02,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.

2448
03:01:02,771 --> 03:01:07,194
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll take like one more call, guys, and I really apologize in advance for those folks that don't get through tonight.

2449
03:01:07,254 --> 03:01:12,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Please, please, please don't be afraid to send us an email, send us some tweets, one of the other ways.

2450
03:01:12,699 --> 03:01:17,803
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that our show is running really long tonight, so we wanted to just take a couple more calls, you guys.

2451
03:01:17,843 --> 03:01:18,904
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to take this first one here.

2452
03:01:19,304 --> 03:01:20,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio.

2453
03:01:20,265 --> 03:01:20,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

2454
03:01:21,806 --> 03:01:22,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Good morning.

2455
03:01:22,327 --> 03:01:23,247
[SPEAKER_00]: This is G-Ditz calling in.

2456
03:01:23,468 --> 03:01:24,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, G-Ditz.

2457
03:01:24,248 --> 03:01:26,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's the other Swede, right?

2458
03:01:27,190 --> 03:01:27,450
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yes.

2459
03:01:27,851 --> 03:01:29,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, how are you, my friend?

2460
03:01:29,273 --> 03:01:29,834
[SPEAKER_03]: How's it going?

2461
03:01:31,035 --> 03:01:31,596
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not too bad.

2462
03:01:31,957 --> 03:01:32,557
[SPEAKER_00]: A bit tired.

2463
03:01:32,698 --> 03:01:33,959
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been up since 2am.

2464
03:01:34,300 --> 03:01:36,122
[SPEAKER_03]: That is hardcore, my friend.

2465
03:01:36,222 --> 03:01:36,743
[SPEAKER_00]: Hardcore.

2466
03:01:36,763 --> 03:01:37,284
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always worth it.

2467
03:01:37,304 --> 03:01:37,704
[SPEAKER_00]: Always worth it.

2468
03:01:38,245 --> 03:01:39,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciate your support.

2469
03:01:39,387 --> 03:01:40,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what's on your mind?

2470
03:01:40,348 --> 03:01:41,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Please, you've stayed up late to talk to us.

2471
03:01:41,950 --> 03:01:42,231
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up?

2472
03:01:43,956 --> 03:01:49,859
[SPEAKER_00]: You already talked about it, I think, but I just want to talk a bit more about Cave Story and its awesomeness.

2473
03:01:50,679 --> 03:01:59,983
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't played it, you really, really need to play it, because it's freeware on PC, and if you really like it on PC, you can always buy it on WiiWare, because he really deserves it.

2474
03:02:00,063 --> 03:02:03,565
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one guy who made one of the most awesome games ever.

2475
03:02:05,545 --> 03:02:06,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Where can people get this game?

2476
03:02:09,255 --> 03:02:16,760
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think there's a different, like a tribute site that has a download with an English patch, because the guy who made it is Japanese.

2477
03:02:17,500 --> 03:02:17,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

2478
03:02:17,821 --> 03:02:21,243
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think he has his own, like, developer site.

2479
03:02:21,323 --> 03:02:23,284
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Studio Pixel, I think he calls himself.

2480
03:02:23,704 --> 03:02:25,245
[SPEAKER_00]: He's usually just referred to as Pixel.

2481
03:02:25,745 --> 03:02:28,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, what's it about this game that just made you fall in love with it?

2482
03:02:29,768 --> 03:02:37,913
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of retro, the music's awesome, the story's actually kind of entertaining, and it has a couple of twists.

2483
03:02:38,666 --> 03:02:42,228
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not your usual Mario, oh, the princess is in another castle.

2484
03:02:42,268 --> 03:02:43,729
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really predict what's going to happen.

2485
03:02:44,470 --> 03:02:48,813
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just an unexplored fantasy world that you've never seen before.

2486
03:02:51,875 --> 03:02:53,196
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the price of free.

2487
03:02:53,416 --> 03:02:53,796
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.

2488
03:02:54,076 --> 03:02:56,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Has anybody been able to follow the guy?

2489
03:02:56,578 --> 03:03:06,765
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's the language differences, but has anybody been able to follow the guy and see if there's a chance of this, I don't know, being an indie game on Xbox Live or coming out somewhere else besides just the PC?

2490
03:03:06,785 --> 03:03:06,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2491
03:03:08,167 --> 03:03:08,567
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.

2492
03:03:09,287 --> 03:03:21,691
[SPEAKER_00]: It is coming out on WiiWare, and I think they had a report on the Wii Channel with him and the American developers who met with him and made the port.

2493
03:03:22,531 --> 03:03:23,312
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not sure.

2494
03:03:23,452 --> 03:03:28,073
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they have an exclusivity deal with Nintendo, because they probably want to keep that.

2495
03:03:28,863 --> 03:03:31,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, maybe there's a WiiWare thing coming up.

2496
03:03:32,105 --> 03:03:35,428
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do notice, by the way, speaking of WiiWare, I guess Dark Tetsuya is all excited.

2497
03:03:35,728 --> 03:03:40,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I think La Mulan is released, must be tomorrow, because I can't think of what else Dark Tetsuya would be excited over.

2498
03:03:40,972 --> 03:03:42,153
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know he's in there.

2499
03:03:42,193 --> 03:03:48,237
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, did you know, Dark Sakura, I know you've been busy with your stuff, but Rondo of Blood finally saw the light of day on Monday.

2500
03:03:48,357 --> 03:03:51,119
[SPEAKER_03]: So part of me wants to hook up the Wii and get that.

2501
03:03:51,579 --> 03:03:52,120
[SPEAKER_08]: You should.

2502
03:03:52,480 --> 03:03:52,760
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

2503
03:03:52,900 --> 03:03:54,621
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to, but it's in a box.

2504
03:03:55,562 --> 03:03:55,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob.

2505
03:03:56,082 --> 03:03:56,263
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

2506
03:03:57,103 --> 03:03:59,304
[SPEAKER_09]: You know how we were supposed to hang out last week and we didn't?

2507
03:03:59,424 --> 03:03:59,765
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

2508
03:04:00,145 --> 03:04:00,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't this way.

2509
03:04:00,765 --> 03:04:01,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to Boston.

2510
03:04:01,686 --> 03:04:01,946
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

2511
03:04:02,166 --> 03:04:02,826
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to Boston.

2512
03:04:02,866 --> 03:04:03,547
[SPEAKER_09]: When you're back.

2513
03:04:03,647 --> 03:04:03,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2514
03:04:04,587 --> 03:04:05,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Rondo of Blood.

2515
03:04:05,348 --> 03:04:07,669
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to do our show that we've talked about.

2516
03:04:08,129 --> 03:04:08,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we do.

2517
03:04:08,569 --> 03:04:09,770
[SPEAKER_03]: We can start with Rondo of Blood.

2518
03:04:09,790 --> 03:04:10,270
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be fun.

2519
03:04:10,330 --> 03:04:10,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, hi.

2520
03:04:10,911 --> 03:04:11,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2521
03:04:11,391 --> 03:04:12,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, listener.

2522
03:04:14,733 --> 03:04:16,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, DarkSakura and I have an argument.

2523
03:04:17,214 --> 03:04:20,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Jiditz, I guess I'll ask you, is there anything else on your mind tonight?

2524
03:04:22,547 --> 03:04:26,609
[SPEAKER_00]: You said last time that you wanted to know the phrases in different languages from people calling in.

2525
03:04:26,709 --> 03:04:26,889
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

2526
03:04:26,909 --> 03:04:32,531
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought I'd just... Saying like hi is just hey or hello.

2527
03:04:32,851 --> 03:04:33,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's easy.

2528
03:04:33,591 --> 03:04:33,891
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.

2529
03:04:33,931 --> 03:04:34,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically hello.

2530
03:04:36,012 --> 03:04:36,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

2531
03:04:36,332 --> 03:04:37,653
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, hello.

2532
03:04:37,673 --> 03:04:37,773
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.

2533
03:04:38,053 --> 03:04:38,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

2534
03:04:38,653 --> 03:04:39,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I can do that.

2535
03:04:39,893 --> 03:04:43,055
[SPEAKER_00]: And goodbye is like heydor.

2536
03:04:43,695 --> 03:04:44,095
[SPEAKER_00]: Heydor.

2537
03:04:44,995 --> 03:04:46,196
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, heydor.

2538
03:04:46,416 --> 03:04:46,856
[SPEAKER_00]: Heydor.

2539
03:04:48,812 --> 03:04:49,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.

2540
03:04:49,532 --> 03:04:51,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you go out to the barn and close the hay door?

2541
03:04:53,154 --> 03:04:53,994
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I'll try.

2542
03:04:54,775 --> 03:04:55,095
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2543
03:04:55,195 --> 03:04:56,316
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I really appreciate that.

2544
03:04:56,376 --> 03:05:03,819
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I need Aki Ripper to call in next, which, by the way, too bad we already did our game show tonight because you and Aki Ripper are both listening tonight.

2545
03:05:04,319 --> 03:05:05,460
[SPEAKER_03]: We could have had a sweet off.

2546
03:05:05,980 --> 03:05:12,823
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you already decided to bow down and let Aki Ripper have the title, but damn it, I wanted my sweet off.

2547
03:05:12,983 --> 03:05:15,845
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess it is to be for another day.

2548
03:05:16,685 --> 03:05:18,688
[SPEAKER_03]: We are running way too long tonight.

2549
03:05:18,768 --> 03:05:20,510
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're like to three and a half hours at this point.

2550
03:05:20,650 --> 03:05:21,952
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost have to go to school soon.

2551
03:05:22,433 --> 03:05:23,815
[SPEAKER_03]: We gotta go and wrap this up.

2552
03:05:24,035 --> 03:05:26,418
[SPEAKER_03]: You better get to school, young man.

2553
03:05:26,758 --> 03:05:27,940
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk to you later, okay?

2554
03:05:29,294 --> 03:05:31,575
[SPEAKER_03]: have a good one buddy same to you, bye

2555
03:05:58,058 --> 03:06:01,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, now's the part of the show where we wrap it all up.

2556
03:06:01,099 --> 03:06:02,920
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we got all of Loki's last minute stories.

2557
03:06:03,060 --> 03:06:04,321
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, I don't know if you had any.

2558
03:06:04,341 --> 03:06:07,842
[SPEAKER_09]: I was mesmerized by reading about the healthcare passing.

2559
03:06:08,122 --> 03:06:09,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's on a lot of people's minds today.

2560
03:06:09,943 --> 03:06:13,504
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to get too political, but it's definitely a historical day.

2561
03:06:13,704 --> 03:06:15,065
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a day that will be remembered.

2562
03:06:15,245 --> 03:06:21,687
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just looking to find out what the specifics were because keep in mind all I've been hearing is all the crap from my Republican slash Libertarian family.

2563
03:06:22,568 --> 03:06:29,130
[SPEAKER_09]: And while I have a good deal in common with the Libertarian platform, there are certain things that I think need to be done.

2564
03:06:29,670 --> 03:06:33,871
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to go into it, but I've been trying to see what exactly made it.

2565
03:06:34,632 --> 03:06:35,912
[SPEAKER_02]: So what exactly is this again?

2566
03:06:35,952 --> 03:06:37,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this that national health care thing?

2567
03:06:37,353 --> 03:06:41,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have to pay more taxes for people that don't have jobs so they can get their fucking health care?

2568
03:06:41,694 --> 03:06:44,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's what it seems like it's like anyways already.

2569
03:06:46,046 --> 03:06:50,953
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they are going to tax the really high, high, high plans, like the Cadillac plans.

2570
03:06:51,193 --> 03:06:52,415
[SPEAKER_03]: That was what I was just reading about.

2571
03:06:52,435 --> 03:06:58,664
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a really nice plan, you might, but if your plan has any deductibles or anything like that, it's probably not one of those plans.

2572
03:06:58,684 --> 03:07:00,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the biggest thing on here is that...

2573
03:07:02,849 --> 03:07:18,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead of treating symptoms with excess drugs, basically the car dealer type of deal where you get more money for the options that go with it, then the focus will be on curing the problem and not the symptoms of the problem, not treating the symptoms, not getting a kickback for selling prescriptions, basically.

2574
03:07:19,370 --> 03:07:20,310
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say this much.

2575
03:07:20,370 --> 03:07:32,313
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to get too much into what I do for a living and to earn my paychecks, but I do work for a big healthcare company here in California, and I'll just say I'm really interested for work tomorrow.

2576
03:07:32,553 --> 03:07:37,294
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a heck of a day tomorrow, so I'm very curious to see what's going to happen.

2577
03:07:37,434 --> 03:07:43,175
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, change is always inevitable, and I think this is one of those things that...

2578
03:07:45,215 --> 03:07:47,276
[SPEAKER_03]: was going to happen, so we'll see what happens.

2579
03:07:47,756 --> 03:08:03,739
[SPEAKER_09]: My only, I will just say this, my only concern about the whole thing is that I think that all of the other government programs need major revamping because I think that yeah, you can change one thing, but you really have to look at what the absolute root of the problem is, and I think that that's with the government itself.

2580
03:08:04,839 --> 03:08:06,520
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know necessarily that I trust them with my money.

2581
03:08:07,380 --> 03:08:09,860
[SPEAKER_03]: I just hope we get a new trauma center game out of all this.

2582
03:08:09,900 --> 03:08:10,741
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I really want.

2583
03:08:10,801 --> 03:08:12,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Trauma center, healthcare bill.

2584
03:08:12,201 --> 03:08:12,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Laughter

2585
03:08:13,976 --> 03:08:14,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Trauma Center Senate!

2586
03:08:32,490 --> 03:08:47,778
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was, it was like, you know, they're, they're playing the game or whatever and he's doing the apology and all of a sudden, you know, she comes up on stage and starts like beating him up with the, uh, with the golf club and she uses the prenup, uh, power up and stuff like that.

2587
03:08:47,798 --> 03:08:48,478
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty funny.

2588
03:08:49,955 --> 03:08:54,236
[SPEAKER_03]: I love SSJ100Matt's comment and I'm even going to make it my final thought tonight.

2589
03:08:54,276 --> 03:09:00,198
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought tonight and I'm going to leave it with what SSJ100Matt said because I think it's great.

2590
03:09:00,558 --> 03:09:00,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Change.

2591
03:09:01,518 --> 03:09:04,139
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always good because you can take it all to Coinstar.

2592
03:09:05,279 --> 03:09:06,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

2593
03:09:07,480 --> 03:09:08,540
[SPEAKER_03]: I need me some money.

2594
03:09:10,333 --> 03:09:12,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan, thank you for being here on the show tonight.

2595
03:09:12,234 --> 03:09:13,895
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you got to say more than you did last time.

2596
03:09:13,915 --> 03:09:14,375
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you did.

2597
03:09:14,455 --> 03:09:15,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Participating in Listless really helped you.

2598
03:09:16,295 --> 03:09:17,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any final thought you have tonight?

2599
03:09:17,996 --> 03:09:18,696
[SPEAKER_04]: I want tacos.

2600
03:09:19,317 --> 03:09:19,937
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get tacos.

2601
03:09:19,957 --> 03:09:20,537
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get you tacos.

2602
03:09:20,557 --> 03:09:21,758
[SPEAKER_03]: You want Del Taco or Taco Bell?

2603
03:09:22,198 --> 03:09:22,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Del Taco.

2604
03:09:22,838 --> 03:09:23,098
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2605
03:09:23,278 --> 03:09:23,498
[SPEAKER_03]: See?

2606
03:09:24,379 --> 03:09:25,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Look what I've turned him into.

2607
03:09:25,679 --> 03:09:28,220
[SPEAKER_03]: This Bay Area kid has fallen in love with Del Taco.

2608
03:09:28,260 --> 03:09:28,621
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.

2609
03:09:29,301 --> 03:09:32,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Sakura, thanks for strolling in late tonight.

2610
03:09:32,302 --> 03:09:33,002

[SPEAKER_03]: It's my house.

2612
03:09:33,703 --> 03:09:33,963
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

2613
03:09:34,003 --> 03:09:34,363
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kidding.

2614
03:09:34,403 --> 03:09:37,564
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't like it, you get the fuck out.

2615
03:09:37,664 --> 03:09:39,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Sakura, your final thought tonight.

2616
03:09:40,605 --> 03:09:42,841
[SPEAKER_09]: Mmm, horseradish is still burning.

2638
03:10:35,257 --> 03:10:40,300
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's the gamers having a voice show, and I'm just the person that helps them get their voices out.
