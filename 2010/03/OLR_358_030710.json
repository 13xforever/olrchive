{"text": " The following program is intended for mature audiences. Orange Lounge Radio. Here's your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Lowkey. Tonight, March 7th, 2010, we get first impressions on Final Fantasy XIII. One of our favorite games is patched with teasers of a sequel, and the Rock Band Network goes live. Orange Lounge Radio. I come bearing a message from President Catt. Here in California, home of Silicon Valley, home of video games, we are in a budget crisis. State employees are furloughed, meaning we can't go to the DMV most Fridays. Students are protesting out on the freeways amidst high tuition cutbacks. Yet somehow, our legislatures found the time last week to pass a resolution supporting Anti-Cussing Week to take place this very week. Residents are encouraged to refrain from cussing and donate swear jar money to charity because swearing bothers some 14-year-old in Southern California. Apparently, swearing profusely shows a lack of intelligence or some sort of lack of character. However, substituting words like opicles and sassafras, which have all of the same intent, is somehow okay and makes you a smarter person. As residents of the state of California, we reject this notion. As intelligent individuals, we take offense to the notion that using versatile swear words somehow demonstrates a lack of intelligence. As free citizens of the United States of America living under the First Amendment, we say, fuck yeah, to free speech. We will work tonight in protest of No Cussing Week to break the record for most uses of the F-word on an internet podcast. Tonight, on a very special Orange Lounge radio, we bring you The Fuck Show. Welcome to another fucking week of Orange Lounge fucking radio. My name is Rob, Fucking Roberts, here with you every week as always. Say hello to the one and only fucking wonderful Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers. Well, fuckity fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. How the fuck are you tonight, young lady? Fucking rad. And pissed off. Why are you so fucking pissed off tonight? Because people just annoy the fuck out of me. Why? What did they do? What ruffled your fucking feathers this week? I'm just fucking annoyed at people feeling like they have to defend their own fucking opinion every fucking time someone says something that's different from them. So fuck them. Not really fuck them, but just fuck in general. I know, just fuck them. Right in their fucking ears. Hey, say hello to the one and only, he is so fucking smart, tech master, Loki. I keep fucking coughing. I wish this fucking gold go away. You have been fucking sick for like 30 fucking weeks now. I haven't been coughing all day long, but then all of a sudden this fucking coughing started after I ate all of my chicken. Would you like some tea? No, I really hate fucking tea. Tea is awful. No, I think it's the root beer. And while delicious the root beer was, it makes me cough. And that's not good. Are you allergic to fucking root beer? No, I am not allergic to root beer. Root beer is awesome. It's just, you know, the carbonation or whatever kind of loosens the fucking phlegm in my throat. So, it sucks. But yeah, otherwise I'm fine. I'm fucking great. Alright, glad to hear it. Alright, well folks, we do have some gaming news to get into a little later. But first, we always fucking start off the show talking about our fucking gaming weeks. Like, anybody really gives a fuck what we've been playing. But that's just how you do a video game podcast. We've been doing it a very fucking long time, about eight years. So, we used to start with a little segment called How Was Your Day? How Was Your Week? But no one really gave a shit. So, we evolved it to fucking video games. So, how the fuck was your gaming week, DarkSakura? It was fucking boring. I played Star Trek Online and made it to Lieutenant Commander. Finally, fuck yeah. And got this weird Klingon chick and a Bajoran dude, but fuck him. And that's about all. I didn't do fuck all. Alright. It's more fucking Star Trek Online, same fucking story every fucking week. But that's alright. That's what it's like to be fucking addicted to an MMO. I should know. I'm not addicted. Fuck you. Okay, sorry. Maybe not fucking addicted, but fucking... I set a day. A day that is my fuck off day. Where I do fuck all. But play my damn game and fuck around on the internet. I think it's good to have a fuck off day. I have fuck off days on days ending in one. I have actually started a project. A fantastic fucking project. That does not involve fucking, by the way. Called Project Real Life. Where this thing, this evil box, this fucking whore of a computer gets turned off. How the fuck are you able to function? But you're fucking playing the game in real life. So I don't understand what the fucking point is. I'm paying attention to my own fucking real life. Well fuck me then. No thank you. Alright. Loki, how the fuck was your gaming week? Well let's talk about how awesome my gaming week was. No wait, let's talk about how awful today was. Today was a fucking mess. You see, I have a fucking 360. Well, many fucking 360s. One of which was apparently going to be modded or J-tagged, if you will. And so I found some guy on Craigslist, which right there should have sent out some fucking signs. That would be willing to do it for me. So we arranged to meet this morning. So I drove a fucking hour and fifteen minutes down the Stockton, the butthole of the Sacramento County. Well actually it's San Joaquin County. Still butthole of the county. And so we went down there, and mind you... Actually, just to quantify. In the fucking state of California, you have fucking Fresno. Which I think is generally accepted as kind of like the asshole of the state of California. No fucking offense to those that live there. Stockton would kind of be... It's kind of like between the asshole and the balls. So Stockton is kind of the fucking taint of California. And there's nothing on the way. And it's not pleasurable. It's just cow country. Fucking shitty smelling cow country. Anyways, so I decided... Okay, mind you, I woke up at 730 this morning. That's fucking early on a Sunday. I drove all the way down there. Met the guy just before 9. Gave him my console. Paid him the $60 it would be, you know, to solder in the chip that I wanted him to solder in. Told me it would take about, you know, fucking 30 to 45 minutes. Four hours later, waiting in fucking Stockton. The guy's not returning any of my text messages. He's not returning any of my phone calls. And so I'm fucking sitting there going, okay, well, I guess I'm either going to fucking sit here all day, or I'm going to have to fucking leave and leave my console behind and assume that I'm getting ripped off. So that's what happened. I got fucking ripped off apparently. Well, fuck him. Yes, fuck him indeed. And so I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt for now. And assume that this really was a mistake and his phone is all fucked up or whatever. And so I will be polite and contact him by email, you know, giving him the opportunity to, you know, fucking ship me my console. However, if he doesn't do that, then I'm fucking posting his phone number and posting his email. Hey, don't forget. Send me his IP. I will find his fucking address. We can go show up at his house and say, fuck you. Give it back. So, anyways, and then Final Fantasy 13. This is not the C-word show. Fuck you. And then Final Fantasy 13. That's, you know, basically been my gaming week. By the way, Dark Soccer is just fucking openly swearing randomly at our fucking chat room. Chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to join all the fucking action tonight in our chat room. Yes, three hours of this tonight, ladies and fucking gentlemen. It could be this or the Oscars, I mean, honestly. And remember, keep track of how many fucks get fucking said so that we can fucking send it to fucking Guinness and fucking Ireland. Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Hey, stop trying to run up the counter artificially. That's not artificial. Fucking stop it. I'm legitimately saying fuck, and I can say fuck as much as I fucking want to, Rob, so fuck you. Oh, in a good way. Loki, any more in your fucking gaming room? Rob, I fucking love you. I fucking love you too, bitch. I also played some more of, oh, what the fuck, Borderlands. I played more of Borderlands because I'm trying to get the game finished before I can, you know, fucking start the new expansion. And I'm liking it still, and I just have to level up my characters. Actually, I have to level up my friend's character because he's fucking 18 levels below me. So, yeah, so I played a little bit more of that. And of course, Grand Theft Auto, you know, fucking, what, ranked like 74 now in the true skill ranks. And then I'm still fucking like 195 in the regular ranks just because I don't play on the weekends. And it's, you know, kind of bounces around during the week, so. But true skill's really where I'm, you know, trying to get to the top of the fucking list. And doing pretty good. So, that's it. You notice how our chat room has been increasing exponentially? Oh, and fuck deft? Cunt. I said it. I hate that word, and I said it, so whatever. I'm looking at the chat, and all these fucking people are in there tonight. We love you all, by the way. We fucking love you and your support so much. But we have Hardcore77777. That's a lot of fucking sevens. And his name there says, oh wow, I picked a bad night to listen. Yes, you fucking picked a bad night. Welcome to your first fucking live show. Congratulations. How was that? Isn't any week a fucking bad night to listen? Who was that? Hardcore77777777. Seven. Seven. And a fucking GP says, fucking GTA again? Fuck Loki, fuck. Hey, I believe that every fucking day. Twice fucking day. Actually, sometimes three fucking times a day. And I fuck everyone up in it, because I'm so fucking awesome. So, I have to. I have to mention it every week. It's what I'm proud of. In fact, and we'll get into this a little bit fucking later, but remember how they updated some TOS stuff for Xbox Live? And now I can post my Ballad of Gay Tony ranks in there without, you know, the word gay being, you know, fucking banning me. Ah, well congratulations I suppose. There's a good reason. That whole policy was kind of fucked anyway. It was overcompensating. Is that a story later we're going to get into? I should probably shut my fucking mouth then. Anything else you want to talk about during your fucking gaming week? Just Final Fantasy's awesome. Alright, my fucking gaming week. I've been playing a lot of fucking WoW as usual. My character's probably to about fucking level 53 I think I finally fucking dinged this week. Fucking addict. Shut the fuck up. Bite my fucking ass. My boyfriend though, he got to level fucking 55, so he can roll a fucking Death Knight now whenever the fuck he wants. But we might do like the twin Death Knight thing like fucking later, but I don't know. Like right now the fucking focus is getting his fucking character to 80. But the problem is I found another game that's going to fucking sink all my time for the next two weeks, which I'll get into in a minute. But I wanted to talk about a couple of other fucking games real quick. One of them is Critter Crunch. It's so fucking cute. And I finally played the full version of the game. I played the fucking demo before. It's fucking cute. It's a lot like Magical Drop. Did you ever fucking play that? Yeah, I played that. I didn't really care for it too much, but... Imagine if Magical Drop wasn't about matching the fucking colors, but it was about putting things in a fucking sequence. Like instead of like fucking all the blues disappear, it's like you got to go fucking green, red, and blue in an order or whatever. That sounds too fucking complicated. No, it's not that fucking bad because it's little bugs, fucking medium-sized bugs, and then big bugs. And it's pretty intuitive to figure out. It's not that fucking hard. And there's these weird elements too where you fucking barf rainbows into little critters' mouths and all these like overly cute fucking things. Well, no wonder you fucking like it. Barfing rainbows. Shut up. It's fucking cute. Shut up. And there's lots of modes in it. I wish I'd bought the fucking game when it was on sale, but it's okay because it's on Alan's PlayStation 3 so I can play it whenever the fuck I'm over there. But it was really cute. I played through a good probably 15 stages while I was there and got some trophies. It's cute. I think it's a fucking good deal and if I wasn't so busy playing something else right now, I might fucking buy the full version. Who wants some fucking tequila? You have fucking tequila? You bought it. If I didn't have to fucking drive home, I would. We can do a shot now. As if my swearing wasn't bad enough right now. Well, fuck it. It's a night just to fuck it. Do you want some tequila? I don't want any tequila. I better pass. I better pass. Thank you though. Fine. I'll drink my beer by myself. You fucking drink yourself into a coma. Alright, let's see. I play Misty too. Why is that? Just tell me about fucking beer. Um, let's see. What the fuck else is I playing? Oh, Final Fantasy II on the fucking iPhone. You kinda know what you're in for if you're gonna download a Final Fantasy game onto the fucking iPhone. Because the iPhone, although it is a gaming platform, it's kind of a fucking terrible one because there's no fucking controller. And that's the worst part about Final Fantasy II. I will say this. The game fucking looks great. It's fucking gorgeous. It's one of the best fucking looking games on the iPhone. It's a port of the fucking PSP one. It is. It's a fucking port of the PSP one, almost like tit for tat. But, they have made some fucking adjustments to it to make it more touch friendly. For instance, when you're in a battle, you have all these little fucking icons instead of the words to attack. And even when you're in the menus to cast fucking magic, there's these little fucking icons that show up that you use to cast your fucking spells and shit. And, you know, if you want to cast your spell on all the fucking enemies, you drag your finger to select all the enemies. You can't unfortunately just fucking sit there and hammer the A button to get through all the fucking battles. You know, you kind of have to tap tap tap tap, so everything's a little bit fucking slower. That's not the annoying part. I don't fucking mind that as much as I do. When you're in the fucking towns, and you're having to use the fucking fake D-pad on the touchscreen and the fucking button to run, And you're trying to talk to fucking townspeople, because the framerate is so fucking bad. And everything is so fucking jumpy that you literally have to chase all the fucking townspeople around for a fucking minute just to fucking talk to them. to them which shouldn't be that fucking hard in a Final Fantasy game well they don't fucking tell you that before you buy it so you won't know until you buy it but I will say this nine dollars is a pretty fucking good price for Final Fantasy 2 again I bought Final Fantasy 2 because I played the original fucking Final Fantasy a ton of times so whatever but the Final Fantasy fucking 2 I only played once on the PSP so I decided what the fuck I'll buy this just to kind of check it out it's only nine dollars I will say this if you have a fucking PSP just spend the extra ten dollars to get a copy of the Final Fantasy yeah you could probably fucking find it used somewhere for cheaper so yeah if you're gonna pay nine dollars for the fucking iPhone version did I say nukin is that a nukin nukin but it's fuck inga yeah thank you I know um if you're gonna spend half as much to get the iPhone version then you fucking get what you fucking pay for that's all I have to say when it comes to controls this kind of weak sauce but it is a beautiful game and you know with being able to save anywhere the fuck you want to it's a good game to just pass the time if you're you know on the fucking potty or sitting at the fucking doctor's office waiting for something it's it'll take you probably a year to fucking beat that way but you can fucking do it so there you go um let's see other fucking gaming news this week okay I'll tell you a game that's been taking a lot of my fucking time Final Fantasy 13 I've sunk about five and a half hours into it so let me give you my first impressions and I'm gonna step away from the f-word thing for a minute because I I know a lot of people are really anticipating this game so I want to talk seriously about this for a minute so Final Fantasy 13 is obviously on its way out on Tuesday and we got a copy through legitimate purposes don't you worry it's it's totally legit and all that stuff just a few days early just so we could jump in there and have something to say about it today it played through the game and you know I've read a lot of the reviews are online just like a lot of you guys have about how the game is is really fucking linear and you know it's kind of just an interactive movie where you're just fucking bashing the X button for a long time and I kind of go well Final Fantasy 7 I see a lot of comparisons from 13 to 7 at least in the bits that I've played so far you might remember in Final Fantasy 7 you started that game and you were in Midgar and you were trapped there you know I shouldn't say trapped it makes it sound like you couldn't do anything but you were playing a somewhat linear story for about the first seven hours of Final Fantasy 7 until you depending on you know how fast or slower you are you tell you get out of Midgar and explore the overworld now I know an overworld well I don't I don't really know what I haven't read spoilers on 13 and I don't want to know so chat stay quiet I don't know if there's an overworld that shows up but I already know there's no towns so I imagine it's gonna stay kind of very well they have took over writing they have in the manual so obviously okay so so there's gonna be some type of overworld later that's gonna be similar to seven in fact honestly guys this game has a lot in common with seven there's a lot of the same types of characters like lightning and cloud have a lot in common except one's got a vagina there's you know the emo kid that you just want to slap across the face there's your sassy black man that's there for comic relief I mean there's a lot of similarities and but that isn't a bad thing I mean Final Fantasy 7 was a really good game it got overblown a little bit by the fucking crazy-ass fans out there but it's it was still a good game 13 is kind of linear in the beginning because you're running down a railroad track so yeah there's not a lot of fucking places to go because you're supposed to be running in a fucking straight line but I kind of consider that part of the very slow learning curve of this game and I think that's what's gonna make or break people consider that you don't learn about paradigm shifts which is this huge fucking change to the battle system until you're three hours into the game is that like x2 or 10 to um I think that's a lot of I mean Lost Odyssey kind of had some of that too a lot of these are so it does remind me a lot of Lost Odyssey actually mm-hmm but Lost Odyssey was more like you know Final Fantasy but when I say it takes three hours to get there I don't want you thinking you're just fucking bored for three hours just sitting there jerking off doing nothing I kind of find this game to be like a like a banana or something that slowly peels and slowly unfold it's our show its true shape and like if you don't I don't know if you read any of the manual or anything like before you started like like falsie and lost you know let's see and stuff like that I was like what the fuck are they talking about turn subtitles on interjection just a fucking interject I'm currently not listening to this because I haven't played it yet and I'm trying to keep the spoiler for I'm not gonna get story but I'm and I want to be completely surprised so I'm I will give little spoilers about the battle system I am zoning the fuck out okay fucking zone out all you want sorry lucky what we say no it is confusing and I do have the subtitles and stuff turned on because you know I don't want to in the my audio whatever cuz I have the five-one headphones or whatever it's very digital sounding it's like a lot of like it's too loud almost like you're like I'm listening to it and at a drive-in theater through one of those really shitty speakers is what it sounds like well here's the thing they're talking to a lot of it starts to make more sense as it goes on the way the storytelling is in this game again I'm not gonna spoil the story itself but the way the storytelling is I draw a lot of comparisons to the TV show lost or you kind of find things out slowly but surely and then a lot is explained through flashbacks like the very opening sequence of the game you're like oh this is just like Final Fantasy 7 people on a fucking train all over again right but you find out the motivations and while that happens through flashbacks that occur in the story so there's a lot of similarities I think between like watching lost on TV but you know how lost kind of divides people like some people are like I this this shows too fucking slow for me they need to get to the fucking point already that's gonna be what makes or breaks people if I'm has he 13 I think as well is that if you're not willing to make that investment and kind of approach this is like a miniseries or kind of you know something like lost like I don't see how you could like a show like lost and then hate the way the story is in this game because it takes fucking forever for things to happen in lost and it takes a little while for things to happen in this game it's it's kind of the same I want to speak really quickly about the battle system real quick okay Final Fantasy and introduces this new thing called paradigm shifts and the easiest fucking way I could explain it is that imagine you could flip your character from a black white mage to a white mage right in the middle of battle that's what the paradigm shifts are all about and it's a lot cooler than I think I'm making it sound because like you know you might be doing a battle and you're trying to chain things to get the monster to kind of slip into this mode where it's easier to hit it and then all of a sudden you're like oh shit I'm low on HP I better paradigm shift so I suddenly get a medic in my party and also maybe somebody that casts barrier and all that shit to protect people and then once everybody's cured up go back to assault yeah because you're really fucking off you're really only controlling the first character in the in each party so you're only controlling the party leader at the rest of them you're kind of having to give like different jobs to and they basically do it um going to our chat room at chat orange lounge radio.com Bo fuck you which kawa says so it's fucking x2 it's a lot more fluid than x2 you know x2 had those big big big animations with the dresh fears and everything it's a lot quicker than that it's not so over the top like it was in x2 it feels a lot more fluid I'm gonna say the battle system in 13 to me feels a little bit more like an action game it takes active time battle to the next level it is like fast paced it is very fucking and ever like you know much like the other final fantasy games you know to get a preemptive strike or whatever is kind of random whereas this you actually can sneak up on enemies because they have like their own you know visual arc that they have their line of sight or whatever and you can if you sneak up around them you can actually you know do preemptive strikes that way and it works a little bit different to where you don't necessarily do damage to them but it jumps that combo up so that you can do more damage to them later on good good question really fucking great question from yyr in chat says so does this mean you don't have to use any strategy when choosing your party because you can swap at any time so far and again granted I'm only five and a half hours in right now for those that are playing the game I'm in a place called thing it's called the valley of ruin is what it's called oh that's all I say I don't want to spoil stories or whatever you don't have control over who's in your party people switch in and out based on the story in fact there's a lot of these people are over here and these people are over here these people are over here and their paths intersect once in a while there's a lot of that going on early on in the game so you don't really have a lot of control over your party. I think later on you'll be able to control that more and also don't worry the way the XP works is very similar to Ten's experience system where you're kind of moving around the board spending points and... That was a little confusing too because I was trying to figure out I was like trying because they're all yeah you pick the direction you want to go and you hold this button down I'm like I want to go this way and it's going the opposite direction I'm like no I want to go the other way it's all right it makes it makes sense later on as you're using it it's very similar to Ten's all your characters gain points when anyone in your party wins so it's not like you're gonna have these obscenely under leveled characters there are no levels for the characters there's there's no levels there's no XP there's a but there you have kind of the Ten's system instead is what you have in place of that there's no magic points which is a huge shift there's something else they use instead of magic points but your characters are gonna be flinging fire and arrow left and right with no consequence you have to really think about that and there is um what else do I want to say there's no magic and there's no oh and after every battle you're cured to full you don't have to cure your party after battle you start heal everybody yeah it's a lot of changes some people are not gonna like it but I say give it a chance I think it's a lot of fucking fun and I'm five and a half hours in I am hooked hooked hooked hooked I want to you guys know I have fucking gamer a DD really fucking bad I'm always like ooh shiny I want to go play this fucking blur beta or I'm gonna go play game room or something I will see this game out to completion I will I know I will I think the story is actually pretty good yeah I like it but if you really really hated the characters in seven you might hate these guys too so just a word of caution because I see a lot of similarities and I don't want to fall down the path of like the really nerdy you know gamer that's you know virgin in his you know basement that's and stuff because we know that's not really the truth of me fuck those stereotypes but here's what I'm saying dude and I feel really wrong saying this but Vanille it's fucking hot like it's like what the fuck 15 that is gross fucking pedophiles dream it's seriously it's like it's like oh not to spoil anything where'd you get your seal oh it's right here my upper thigh like oh come on yeah that was Alan and I were both like just had that big reaction of oh I feel dirty oh oh god that was dirty oh god what's up with her voice actor or actress I should say it's just like got an accent and she's I don't even know what's wrong but it's weird it's just seriously weird it's like oh the one thing and I'll wrap this up because I know Jamie's like I want to talk about something else I was doing my fucking laundry okay but well I just want to say this really quick one thing that just blew me the fuck away when I was playing this game like seriously it's the little things that count well two things a when you fucking load your game after having taken an hour break or something you get a fucking explanation of where you're at in the story so you can remember where the fuck you left off which is great like just it's a lip it's little things that count also blew me the fuck away you ready the lips are in sync with the English dialogue that's right that it is not a really bad dub they did that with 10-2 though did they I didn't play enough of 10-2 I watched some people also didn't really get in mind that the ending cinemas actually a lot of the cinemas were re-synced to also fit the English dialogue and the end sequence the little song that unit gets up and sing was completely reanimated I was fucking blown away by the like it's those little things that just made me go whoa and by the way since it hasn't really been mentioned yet the game is fucking gorgeous it is a beautiful beautiful game and I know I've seen those reports others say no the 360 version looks worse than the ps3 who cares play the fucking game I don't care what system you get it on that we're getting the ps3 one and that's what I got to but I was just I just knew the 360 was a port and I you know what I just I wanted my achievement points did you go 360 yes I did I went 360 okay I have is no no biggie as three discs and you know what though I mean honestly how often am I gonna be shifting new discs around what whenever I get to that point oh my god I have to put another disc in the machine I feel so old you'll be amazed at how fucking much they probably squeezed onto one disc it it's just it's a beautiful game it is so like I just blown away by some of the visuals and like it's not all just like the industrial looks that you've seen in the trailers and things it is a well fuck it was funny my friend you know work he was like oh I don't know if this Final Fantasy is gonna be good or whatever so we played you know I started playing the game and literally got five minutes into it and it got that first action sequence that's in the train where she's jumping off the fucking walls and shit he's like yeah this game's not gonna be a problem nice all right enough about Final Fantasy 13 I'm sure we will talk some fucking more about it next week and I will work the f-word more into my dialogue I'm sorry I just want to have a serious conversation cuz that's like one serious topic I know people been wondering about but isn't part of this to prove that you can make a fucking serious point and sound fucking intelligent you know I'm still saying fuck a little bit I still want to go over the top with it all right well but well we did kind of go over the top at first that's all right well I'm not going over the fucking top all right enough enough fucking talk about fuck let's get on to some fucking gaming news here we're gonna do some fucking housekeeping though real

was pissed the fuck off though that they didn't have the Tron 2 trailer before it because we didn't see the fucking 3d version well the 3d version was just not playing at the right time and it's more expensive and I honestly don't think the fucking 3d was that good and you know Alice in Wonderland just based well you know what I saw in the trailer by the way I neglected some of our chatters are really fucking confused right now that we're suddenly talking about playing the pink anus let me give some fucking background to that you first off listen to last week's show it's all fucking explained there but there's a game on Steam called what what the fuck is it secrets of the magic crystal and it's a game that looks like you're breeding unicorns or some fucking bullshit but one of the items that you're using if you look at the various screenshots one of the items you use in your fucking horse breeding has these little pink bars and they're called anus a en us so we officially have fucking called this the pink anus game because it's funny and you get to say anus and you're not being vulgar you're just talking about what's in a video game so there you fucking go there's some explanation on what's going on all right um let's see what other fucking housekeeping do I have fucking why aren't you fucking following us on Twitter and Facebook and all that stuff twitter.com slash olr we'll take your fucking Twitter questions later you know because it is the show where every fucking gamer has a voice even when that voice is very vulgar we also have our Facebook at orange lounge

it's great we got you know these two guys chase VX Jason XV and deep man worked very fucking hard on the website by the way deep man speaking of the website I need to fucking say this real quick fucking deep man posted a fucking great little exposition on a game I don't know a fucking lot about but it's Yakuza 3 I haven't really been fucking following this very closely because I didn't really play Yakuza 1 or Yakuza 2 but I still found deep man's article very fucking interesting because Sega made all these fucking localization changes to Yakuza 3 that have people pissed off and I think deep man does a very fucking good job of running it down and I'm also just kind of fucking appreciative that there's like actual content on our website besides just the show postings so I'm tipping my fucking hat to deep man right fucking now so yeah and if you want to write stuff for our website get in touch with me you can send me an email Rob at orange launch radio.com we're looking for opinions and shit stuff that fits into the fucking every gamer has a voice thing so if you're interested drop me an email we'll see what we can fucking do and go read deep man's article it's pretty fucking great and deep man posted just for you Jamie something on Digimon earlier I don't know if you fucking saw it yeah go go orange launchradio.com I don't know if you can see. It's our own fucking website take a look. I've been busy Rob. what else I want to say oh yes on orange launchradio.com on the left side there's a little fucking box that is says I don't even remember what it says but it's got all the links that's funny fucking loser tonight it's it's where it has all that like the Twitter icon and the last FM and all the places you can follow us and so forth extended play that's what it's fucking called extended play just look at that box it's like all the communities were on and check that out the link to the OLR PSP if you're on a PSP and you have not visited OLR PSP.com you're fucking missing out. Where the fuck have you been? I know exactly well I know we get new listeners every week so I haven't fucking updated that in a long time. I'm very sorry by the way if we have new listeners tonight I know this is not normal if this is your first fucking show you need to realize tonight is a fucking protest we are exercising our first fucking amendment fucking rights congratulations if you made it this far and keep in mind normally we are really Rob will say that he will literally say quote the f-word end quote or f that and why am I doing quote fingers you can't fucking see what I'm doing um it makes great fucking radio bite my fucking ass please I said it nicely please makes it nice please makes it very fucking nice but here's the other thing to keep in mind is that I bet anything there's gonna be one of those fucking like podcasts that reviews other podcasts or something or some fucking asshole on his blogs and say listen the orange lounge radio and all they did was say fuck cuz they're just stupid and can't think of anything else to say you other podcasts that seems like again waste again we are protesting the anti-cussing week that our government has seen fit to waste fucking money and time voting upon when we are in the middle of what we've hit budget crisis besides the sides are fucking going out on the freeway and getting like threatening to get fucking run over by cars in protest of how bad the fees have gone to universities and I mean I'm a student myself and even going to junior college right now is fucking expensive and come on look at how bad the fucking universities are if these students think that that's a good idea running around on the freeway didn't they fucking learn that and like preschool here's the thing I think we should have a 60 star loving what I need the ol army and the people that get it tonight you fucking cool kids that are understanding the show tonight if you see this shit out there on the internet somewhere fucking tear them a new asshole because honestly fucking independent people should be supporting each other not tearing each other down I don't fucking talk bad about independent podcast open fucking season on those that get paid to do it in the core podcast though I will I will rip them apart but indie podcasts need to fucking help each other out and if I may make my own statement about that and this goes even on an individual basis usually when someone puts down somebody else without giving any constructive feedback it's because they are having issues with themselves low fucking self-esteem leads to bitchiness sorry haven't you noticed that usually the people who are the loudest or certain people who are um anti-gay I was just fucking that that happened in our backyard at main national news right huge fucking anti-gay Republican no no I shouldn't there are some cool Republicans believe it or not it's just the wrong fucking people are in control of that party right now like Meghan McCain I'm down with her she is a cool Republican but yeah idiots like this guy who fucking voted you know yes on a and then fucking has all this legislation it's fucking anti-gay gets caught at faces a gay bar the Jamie and I have fucking gone to this place makes gay look straight I've been there coming back from fucking faces with another guy in his car I mean anyway sorry we need to go back and do karaoke at faces that would be a lot of fun I actually I actually though did have another point with this is that you know it's not really just the budget crisis that haven't we hit what is it somewhere between 14 and 17 percent statewide unemployment so people there's no fucking jobs out there yet instead of doing things you know to help people get jobs to create new programs they're wasting their time and effort on safeguarding morality which is an individual choice so to our government right now fuck you in your ear because your ass is not good enough come some quick fucking comments from chat hardcore 77 once note says both Republicans and Democrats are corrupt I fucking agree with that honestly because the budget crisis we have in the state right now it's everybody's fucking fault no I totally agree you know I think part of the problem I got hate going back to the political topic sorry it needs to be said it needs to be said the part of the problem is that we are so stuck in this bipartisan you know system I mean I'm sure if you ask anybody it's even on public sites to say America has a two-party system that's a fucking lie we do have independent political parties it's just the Democrats and the Republicans are the ones with the money to spend on it and the independence fall to the wayside you know it's the only that is the reason why I wish that Perot had won I'm saying that is I get for what for what he fucking stood for I get it I get for what he would do for the I think morale I'd pick but okay he's the one I would have picked but I'm saying that as an independent who came to me exactly you know four years vote him out you know at least you know business won't be fucked up he's a businessman but I'm saying that I would like to see the wall shattered I'd see people break out of their little voting strict Republican because oh they're Republican I want people to this is why I get an absentee balance every ballot ballot every fucking year because I go through my ballot item by item look up each of the people in the comfort of my home without having to waste time at the booth or anything without people breathing down my neck and see who everyone is and vote for somebody with a well-informed choice so I'm just saying Oh full ticket okay I got I'm sorry that's okay it's a we fucking say things that aren't fucking I mean this whole show tonight is not fucking necessarily about video games but um where was I at also Oh liquid parrot in chat I had a really fucking good comment what podcast is talking trash about my beloved olr no one is yet it's just that I'm on Google alerts because I'm fucking narcissistic right and I want to see everybody who's talking about orange lounge radio no I don't I don't consider that narcissistic I just consider that running a good business you want to know what's being said about you on the internet and sometimes I'll see these fucking blogs from people writing their individual blogs like podcasts I subscribe to and I unsubscribed from orange lounge radio this week because I find them very annoying and the girl talks too much and and the guy is too gay and the other guy is too angry and blah blah like just shut the fuck up talk about a podcast you do like it nobody reads your fucking blog because you're so fucking negative that's the thing anyhow but as far as far as I know the other podcasts are cool if somebody is talking about us I don't know yet but if I find out it's fucking on all right anyhow how about 45 minutes in the show and now some fucking gaming news right Loki all right let's get into this um so there's this bug that fucking popped up last week we thought it was you know maybe someone hacking the fucking PlayStation Network or something like that which that still begs the question what the hell was that web page then that said you know hey turn off your turn on your fucking Java and your whatever so I don't know what that was but anyways this was completely unrelated all apparently the most of the fat PlayStation threes the old style ones had trouble connecting to the PlayStation Network due to a bug in one of the arm chips and apparently this was caused by the PlayStation 3 thinking apparently that it was a leap year when it wasn't and it became unsinked and so because of this you know date time you know desynchronization it was unable to connect to the PlayStation Network as a like a precaution the safety precaution or something anyways within you know a little amount of time it was actually fixed basically the only advice they fucking gave was don't turn your system on because you know you may lose your trophies and you know you're some games you may not work in blah blah blah my favorite was how when it was all fucking over they were like we fucking fixed it it's okay to turn on your fucking PlayStations now and they didn't do a goddamn thing they just waited it out that's all they did they didn't fucking fix it they just it was it was a bug in the date and as soon as the date changed all better so some somebody fucked up and thought 2010 was a leap year and somehow that made it in the old fucking PlayStation here's here's my fucking problem with that is apparently the those chips were actually the same chips that were in the zooms and you may not remember the end of 2008 I think when a switched over the end of the year they like fucking New Year's yeah it was like New Year's and all the students stopped working because of the arm CPU chip and apparently there's a date bug in that too and oh guess what the same chip was actually inside you know the PlayStation 3 all along and it was a known problem but they just kind of we forgot all about it you have fuck soon I don't didn't well I don't have one anymore times get tough but yes I mean you know you don't really want your whatever to stop working all of a sudden because oh we didn't realize there's a bug in here and that's a problem I don't know and it doesn't look good when your console stop fucking working the only advice they can give you is don't play guess what Sony I was already not doing that or doing that whatever I know don't play your ps3 for a day okay I can fucking do that that's very easy so um what the what the fuck else is I gonna say about this oh here's the thing yes Sony is is wearing a lot of fucking egg on their face for this colossal fuck up and you know a lot of people are razzing them this week and rightfully so but honestly is the red ring of death any fucking better I'd rather have all the ps3s go down for a day and have it be all you know hunky dory afterwards and have all the 360s go down permanently but but I will say this it does kind of show that it's kind of fucked up that when something like this happens I can't fucking play heavy rain or some of the other games that connect to the network their needs it's very reminiscent of that very controversial Ubisoft DRM that I know we're going to get into later in the show but it just fucking strikes me as like a little hint of that and I do not like that do not fucking want so there's a piece of me that's like Sony doesn't need to fucking fix the date issue Sony needs to fucking fix the I can't play my games online if something is broken on their end issue that's the fucking problem well here's the other fucking thing that it's really bad is since they didn't really do anything I mean is this actually gonna get passed out or like four years from now are we gonna run in the same fucking problem again I will forget about it it's okay oh yeah you remember that one time that all those ps3s went fucking down yeah it's gonna happen again cuz it's not a leap year but try telling that to the PlayStation it makes whatever year it wants fucking leap so well is there a fucking possibility this is gonna happen in the future I don't think it will be because they'll be probably patched out let's put it something to ignore it all right in other fucking Sony news we have news about their fucking motion controller that's been kind of quiet ever since the last e3 but I'm assuming that it's because they're gonna have some fucking new news this year at e3 but the term PlayStation arc has been fucking trademarked in Japan so you know we were calling the fucking ice cream cones that light up as you wave them around like a freak apparently is gonna be called the PlayStation arc which is not like these fucking new news because you know they might remember there was a story earlier in the year where this fucking guy I think at THQ had said the name earlier anyway so PlayStation arc sounds like it's gonna be the fucking name but we'll see now also to kind of take that a step further apparently Konami has a trademarked a game name and it's called Gradius arc you know what I this is you know just me thinking out of my ass but um you know what I think arc could stand for augmentive reality controller oh look at you look at me my fucking acronyms yeah yeah I mean there's only unintelligent people swear I like that I think you're right I think fucking arc is an acronym for something I think that's a very fucking realistic because all the stuff that they were showing in like their demos were augmented reality demos either that or it's gonna be specific for all arc the lad games I somehow really fucking doubt that or you'll build a stick two of each animal into that controller shut up it will be the controller how the fuck will that work playing fucking Gradius with a motion controller do you fucking just flail around to move your fucking ship all around and then pew pew pew with your button like I don't fucking understand that how does how is Gradius gonna incorporate motion control that makes no sense oh by the way Becky just alerted me to something what's that that um cuss free week did not pass the Senate no it was it was on the news and everything oh I'll see if I can get her to send me a link maybe there's more well still still it doesn't matter because it doesn't matter the fucking point still stands whether it passed or not because they wasted their fucking time actually voting on this it's even worse if it didn't fucking pass because they wasted all the fucking time for fucking nothing so fuck them yeah any attack on my free I don't know how you would fucking play Gradius though with a motion controller the only thing I could think of is that maybe you control the options that way or something I don't know me I flail around and knock the ships out of the way it sounds dumb well name but the thing sounds dumb they also passed they did pass California acupuncture day what the fuck I am not even gonna try to dignify that one let's move on to another fucking news story dark Sakura what the fuck you have for us well I have something and I actually just posted pictures up on our fucking website there are ESRB listings for ps3 and PSP games there is alpha mission 2 baseball stars professional league bowling and super sidekicks which are all neogeo titles to pop up on the PSN so maybe we would see them and you know as soon as I saw the little capture caption on the on destructoid I had to go grab my game and take a picture that is a big fucking box for a video game it is god bless those games fucking stars oh and by the way paid 48 bucks for it yikes yeah but keep in mind how much we paid for fucking king of fighters 2000 that's true weren't those fucking games like fucking $200 and they first we paid 350 for it but at the time all the others were the other sites were selling it for about 400 so we got a really good fucking deal on it all right yeah um some some fucking clarifications in our chat room because of course they the chat room gets all sicked on it and everything it did fucking pass the assembly but it was rejected in the Senate is there like a high crisis my point still stands it was a waste of fucking time no matter what happened and that this was even allowed to get somewhere and that people are fucking listening to this guy and you know what they stand for and everything so point still stands and besides you all have been one in the fucking fuck show for like a year and a half this is a good fucking reason the jokes been running for like a year and a half so now is as good of a time as any all right Loki yes so apparently there's been a whole lot of drama going on with Activision this week earlier this week Activision had I guess let go the two the two leads over at infinity Ward Vince Zappanella and Jason West and these two studio heads just all the sudden aren't working there anymore and now more and more information you know kind of came out about that and apparently it was according to a bunch of lawsuits here because now they're filing lawsuits against Activision for unpaid royalties apparently these guys you know they did all their hard work on modern warfare 2 or whatever and Activision wanted them you know they're kind of strong arming them into making you know the next modern warfare game or whatever next you know war game take place in Vietnam and whatever the case may be but to get out of paying them royalties they decided to go ahead and let them go and so it's kind of interesting now of course they their comments on it we were shocked by Activision's decision to terminate our contracts we poured our heart and soul into that company building not only a world-class development studio but assembling a team we've been proud to work with for nearly a decade we think that the work we've done speaks for itself and it says after all um all we have given Activision we shouldn't have to sue to get paid and of course Activision you know responding to their lawsuit they say that they're disappointed in the lawsuit and that it's meritless says Activision is disappointed that mr. as Zamper Ella and mr. West have chosen to file a lawsuit with and believes their claims are meritless over eight years Activision shareholders provided these executives with their capital they needed to start in Finney Ward so basically they say hey we made you now we can break you as well as financial support resources and creative independence that helped them flourish and achieve enormous professional success and personal yes because if they didn't give them money I'm sure that they couldn't create these wonderful games is what they're saying you know granted that studios do need you know money to get going but I think it's just a creative talent behind it that creates the games anyways I continues in return Activision legitimately expected them to honor their obligations to Activision just like any other executives who hold positions and trust in the company while the company showed enormous patience it firmly believes its decision was justified based on the courses of conduct and act actions basically long story short they were unhappy with what was going on with Activision and so they were the rumor is that they were kind of shopping around elsewhere not the only ones that are kind of had their fucking fill of Activision and that's for sure can I read this quick comment from chat from odd fuck again the opinions in our chat room are not necessarily those of us here on the show but here's odd fuck in our chat room Bobby Kotek needs to die in a fucking fire with fucking fire ants on his face while everyone fucking pisses on him might be a little bit extreme but but isn't tonight all about extremes um here's the thing though I I kind of fucking believe this guy's days this guy's days are numbered Activision has such a fucking bad rap right now there has been just like this one two three four punch you have the fucking king's quest game gets shut down you have the fucking all these subsidies of Activision getting shut down all the stuff that's fucking going on now with you know their biggest selling game I mean the Bobby Kotek is looks like a fucking buffoon right now like if I were a shareholder I would be demanding some fucking answers and calling for some fucking you know I I just think it's they look stupid and unfortunately you know if infinity what it would comes down to is if infinity ward ends up you know dissolving or whatever me though let's move on to because they were before they were behind Medal of Honor and stuff they were working on that series and they left to go form you know this new company basically to you know create the Call of Duty series and the Call of Duty series has been really awesome but you know if they're gonna be treated like dicks I mean come on Activision's been so awful now that they're making EA look fucking awesome I want to address some fucking good points in chat shadow fucking runner says Robert they still making money and why oh I are says Rob it doesn't matter people are still buying their products in droves the shareholders demands results well hold on guys because all this fucking stuff has come out like literally within the past couple weeks and although we've kind of known Activision's I'm going down a shady path for a while this whole one-two punch I'm talking about is just in the past couple weeks so you're gonna I don't mean he's gonna fucking get you know pulled from the board tomorrow but wait about six months to a year wait a little while and see when that next modern warfare games comes out if it's not fucking up to par it's over if guitar hero sucks it's over they're done guitar hero is done for if the next fucking game sucks you know what I mean wait for kind of you kind of have to wait to see how this all plays out but if some of these decisions lead to really bad things the holiday season just look it will have a you how they treat their franchises I mean Call of Duty they're putting out new ones every year I mean they're basically the whole reason they even you know take on you know brutal legend that kind of stuff and Ghostbusters well we can't figure out a way to pump out a new game every year in this franchise so we're just not gonna take it and then same with guitar hero I mean look how they're treating like download content stuff very little each month and look at DJ here what Wow two download packs thanks thanks a lot way to support it I will fucking say this though you do have a fucking point that it's about the money they can do all the fucking dickhead things they want in the world in the end it's about the money but my little but with that is or my big but depending on whatever you want to look at it as don't underestimate the the gamers and the kind of the impact that all that negative press on all the blogs and shit can have I could be wrong and that's fucking fine I think it's gonna come down unfortunately it's gonna fucking be just like you know the protests or whatever what Call of Duty you know how they're saying oh we're protesting this game we're not gonna fucking buy it yeah and sure enough everyone's buying it you know or you know the Left 4 Dead thing of course that's a different company but still you know remember fucking the Left 4 Dead fucking thing on Steam that all the fucking people were playing Left 4 Dead 2 where they got the screenshot yeah same same story so if you really fucking mean it if you're really fucking you pissed off that these guys got fired for all their hard work then you need to stop fucking buying the games just stop don't buy the next Call of Duty game it's not gonna be an infinity Ward game anyways I mean that's if you want to wait the way you want to look at it I mean look at they're gonna put Treyarch and you know charge of it and unfortunately Treyarch is just not as good as Infinity Ward I mean people even know that I just I don't know just you know vote with your money all right let's talk about some fucking titties how's that sound perk there's there's one thing better than freedom of speech it's nudity and there's some titties to be found in fucking heavy rain here's the deal I won't try to spoil the story too bad but there is a love scene that happens at one point in the game you know should be fucking obvious if you've seen some of the previous of the game that it kind of pushed the envelope so there's a love scene now if you decline the kiss and trigger the sequence anyway and reload your saved game right away then you'll have the female lead running around titties flapping around everything is all just hanging out so there you go you can run around and play naked now of course the naked model was not made in the game to be run around and play naked well but there's a shower scene that happens in the in the oh I saw this what's interesting here here's the fucking part I think is interesting though is that you know since everybody gets all fucking bent out of shape because a nudity specifically the ESRB is this game gonna go back to the board for an AO rating isn't this the same fucking thing that happened in oblivion for the PC version ended up getting pulled and fucking rated AO because even though you weren't supposed to be able to ever see the titties the titties were there because they fucking would use them to base like a sheer top on I think though that it's still okay because you actually do see that model in the game it's just now that you're using that model for more than just that one scene but isn't I mean for whatever reason I think it's fucking stupid but the the fucks out there the rate things are like there's a big difference between a butt and a pussy yeah but if they didn't all that is is 100 here's the thing if they didn't if that model wasn't in the game if it was just like you know she's behind a shower curtain or something like that and they're just using that model or whatever for like a silhouette or something that's different but you actually use this model in the game for one of the scenes you actually see her completely naked so it's just if they're gonna you know are you anything it's gonna be fucking duration why didn't they just do like the Sims pixel thing watch I miss fucking cleo right here watch next week on the fucking show there's gonna be a story about some mother filing a fucking lawsuit against because they fucking found this in the game because their kid read about this on the internet on one of the gaming blogs so they fucking go in and unlock the character and suddenly mom walks in and there's some fucking titties on the screen and she fucking loses her shit not knowing that that's the game she bought for her kid and there's a fucking lawsuit next week's show that'll be a story if not next week two weeks but the bodies in the game already it would be just the same badge and everything it would be just the same is if they he didn't there's a lot or whatever and um you know nope no if they didn't do the mod or whatever and just the shower scene it would be exactly the same I hope you're right that there's no basis but I don't know her boobs don't move like real boobs I have a feeling well I don't think you were ever supposed to be able to just fucking walk her around and shit like that yeah uncanny valley my ass I'm sorry that doesn't all look real we need some real looking titties we need to we need team ninja to fix this yeah yeah range of motion in the face but where is the range of motion in the fucking titties not rare dark soccer has got a fucking new story for us then we'll get into some fucking release dates yes fucking story happy fucking birthday PlayStation 2 dude I totally want someone to make me a ps2 cake that'd be cool anyway um yeah ten years ago ps2 launched in Japan yay um I have a Japanese ps2 me too I have the first model one and it still works I bought mine I don't even know if mine still fucking works I haven't touched it in years I bought it a little ways later I bought it for beat me in a 2d x6 style because I was fucking addicted to 2d x I think that's what we got ours for too and that and playing some of some of the the few JRPGs that I had some of the fucking cool kids in town they had their ps2 is for third and fourth style I didn't get on that train till about six thousand and first they can beat me in a game the big thing that gets me on this one is that there actually are people that still use their ps2 there's still ps2 games being released so we're looking at a ten-year-old system it's not funny that people never fucking believe that the PlayStation 3 has a ten-year life cycle and people go that's too fucking long look at the ps2 it is still fucking going after ten years yep yeah so a ten-year life cycle is very valid at the end of its life cycle but yes it's so it needs to be put down you know so a happy fucking birthday PlayStation 2 just just really fucking quick just kind of reminiscing a minute here what would you guys say were some of the important PlayStation 2 moments for you that like had an impact on gaming for you you know like as a Final Fantasy fanboy I think playing fucking Final Fantasy 10 for the first time was a huge moment for me I know about you guys what was like a huge moment in PlayStation gaming for you I bet I bet I know Loki's Grand Theft Auto 3 that was good but driver 3 it introduced me to the lowest of the low the guy game ps2 for me fucking beat me into DX sorry when I got my I remember the day I beat everything on light 7 and fifth style I freaking called everybody and posted on my life journal I passed Regulus I hate Regulus I passed no wasn't Regulus it was a what was the light 7 version of Regulus I I something into the lighter right in the light but no the the really fucking hard songs I think were sink and Regulus yeah I don't remember you know how many fucking years ago that was that's older in this show okay well I've got a now this is gonna bother me but I just the day that I beat everything in light 7 although I still haven't done it in fourth style because of no I did beat that I beat everything in fourth cells it was third style I didn't because I couldn't beat um the Safari the Safari yeah but still it was like that was my squeal I love the ps2 moment I DJ synthetic fucking Koneko in our chat room says silent fucking hello my fucking god yeah yeah yeah silent hill 3 oh I fuck deaf says I got my ps2 for DDR and Kingdom Hearts yeah Kingdom Hearts is pretty fucking epic that's for sure lots of good comments in our chat room chat on orange on twitter.com yyr says boo ps2 boo I still dislike you because those of all the people who didn't buy or develop for the Dreamcast because they were waiting for you fucking Charan says play shadow of the fucking Colossus that was a pretty epic game too very fucking epic all right well happy fucking birthday ps2 and for those of you still playing the ps2 you might want to think about upgrading although I will say I do hope that the fucking backwards compatibility comes to the PlayStation 3 at some point and I know this is a big fucking wrap around I don't want to dread dirt mine has it I know some of the old-ass systems do but by the time those systems break they're gonna want to put out on the fucking marketplace ps2 games for download we all know it's coming it's just a matter of when but the reason why I said put out the reason why I somewhat welcome it I'm a little iffy on it I want to go back and play Final Fantasy 12 again without having to hook up my ps2 you want to know how many times I guess I would pay $20 to know how many PlayStation 2 games I've played in my ps3 that's fully backwards compatible zero zero I thought oh yeah I'm going to go back and play some grand theft auto Sandrais nope we played a few I don't remember what we have you actually Rob um crap what game was it you said oh you know it reminded me of a game that a franchise that I wish they'd bring back jumping flash could you imagine a ps3 jumping flash that'd be fucking crack that would be epic you know what else I've I played a lot of games on my xbox 360 backwards compatibility as well a whopping zero none and you know why because I have an Xbox 360 I'm buying new games for it why do I need to go to a few times and no we also use it for a few games you're so fucking now I tell you what though I did use my ps2 my ps2 a lot for ps1 games from mostly for my Japanese one to play my import so I didn't have to I might want to go get out of the Colossus again I play ps1 games on my ps3 but mostly the PSP like I played what was that one game of the guy with a big fro that we were playing at all games lounge on ps1 on ps1 but it was playing on a ps3 I don't remember that game was cracked out but I now I can't remember the name of it I don't remember that was a long fucking time ago you really tested my fucking memory on the show God hand might be good I didn't play that one either how about some fucking release dates let's travel the globe and check out some release dates I'm sure there's something fucking coming out this week something something's finally coming out it'd be fantastic 13 no yeah finally 13 is coming out this week on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 finally you know what how many years we've been waiting for that thing uh funny enough is Final Fantasy 14 is coming out this year too Wow it's a sign of the apocalypse maybe two Final Fantasy games in a year possibly three I don't know um okay so other stuff coming out 50 classic games on the DS well I'm thinking that there's games in there somewhere Resident Evil 5 gold edition it's Resident Evil 5 but better with more stuff yay and slightly cheaper Sam max 2 beyond time and space coming out as a compilation on PC and we case you didn't buy them all separately calling on the Nintendo Wii which shares cover almost with final not Final Fantasy with obsessed much are we yes Final Fantasy Final Fantasy no um now it shares a box art with almost Silent Hill and it looks Silent Hill ish maybe but it's not photo showdown for the DSI it's right DSI not DS it's a game sort of like monster rancher except you use the pictures that you take with your DSI camera and based on the colors that are in there it creates different monsters not quite as cool as you know putting random CDs in your PlayStation 2 or barcode scanner or the barcode scanner yes that's true we need to bring back barcode scanners Assassin's Creed 2 on PC this week wait a second I'm confused it's not supposed to be out yet right yeah people are complaining about not being able to play it I'm thinking that that dates wrong it must be out on steam or something you know the box versions coming out this week also racket sports coming out on the Wii it's Ubisoft's answer to Wii sports and it features all different games you can play with rackets and they also have support for the stupid camera that came with you self fitness because you know all those games that use cameras for motion capture have been so awesome so far granted the tall and you know the arc might be good but so far they sucked yeah they're in game for girls it's a girly game where you play a little girl minigames yay fun like pillow fights and braiding each other's hair something like that count me out Yakuza 3 coming out on PlayStation 3 and this of course is a game that's getting lots of controversy for stuff that they've localized and removed apparently people like their Japanese trivia and bar hostesses and then of course later on this week blaze blue calamity trigger coming to PSP that's gonna be pretty awesome on PC Warhammer 40k dawn of war 2 the gold edition kind of a re-release compilation of those games and then also the new expansion will be coming

getting price drops in Japan this week on the 360 some new games coming out as well including red seeds profile which is kind of looks like a silent hillish kind of game it takes place in a remote village but this time in Canada it's supposed to be like 150 people there and then they find a body and it's about the killer in the rain data done you're an FBI agent so I don't know if it's like their answer to heavy rain or web it kind of just looks like one of those like scary thriller type of games so that is on 360 this week and then another game called Akatsuki no I'm Anika toe out sorry toe I kaijin comes out this week as well it's one of those like cute girl comedy type games it's not like a dating sim but it's just kind of like one of those like adventure games with you know cute

Kishi fuck they have some long names for games out there it's an RPG game on the PlayStation 2 again looks very anime heavy influenced multi-hit combos though and some of the sequences some really kind of pretty looking DVD ish style cutscenes and a very anime style looks like although it's RPG it might be a little bit action-based in its battles there you know they need to have more games with the word grand thesis in the title what the fuck ever all right let's see other games coming out this week I'm checking the fucking handhelds real quick Sony PSP gets battle spirits hero soul shin sangoku musu multi-ray to zetai hero kaizo kekyaku all of those fucking games are out in Japan this week also out this week I have judgment legends not Japan though but that's in Asia those are all in the fucking Sony PSP and I just need to fucking remind everybody that is not part of the deal because the game makes sense on a PSP because there's no camera peripheral all right and on the Nintendo DS one really big game this week fucking worth noting RPG sukuru ds it's an RPG maker game on the Nintendo DS so you know a lot of folks I know really you're into those games that's kind of cool well unfortunately it's very Japanese heavy so you're gonna have to I know your Japanese if you want to fucking play this game or you're gonna need to bake somebody to localize it enter brain is putting it out in Japan I don't know I don't think I know that company over here by the way although it's technically next week I should point out the DS releases are thinning out a little bit because next week is Pokemon heart gold and soul silver are on their way on the Nintendo DS we know everybody fucking loves Pokemon so there you go that's it for Japan Dark Sakura what the fuck for UK oh if you fucking odds and ends Final Fantasy 13 on the 9th on the 10th scrap metal for Xbox 360 12th is Benton alien force viljaks attacks what the fuck is that last rebellion Warhammer 40k dawn of war 2 chaos rising boo Warhammer okay you know what my problem with Warhammer is and Yakuza 3 that's all that there is all right some more fucking news than the classic game of the week everybody fucking loves the classic game of the week and I'm sure Dark Sakura picked a pretty fucking good one this week she usually does but just a few more stories before we get there I know you could all use a break to wash your mouths out with soap there's been some interesting fucking updates to the game portal this week they had a couple updates did you see the cover of Game Informer yes it did hmm jumping ahead of me here that's right so the first update that was out there was a patch that added some more radio dialogue I guess and there was some different messages that were in Morse code also some encoded messages with the numbers and equations in them and this was all part of like the radio that you would hear you know every now and then I think it was also in the room that you started off in and it was all kind of hinting different things now the people that looked at those images or whatever that was in the little radio messages it's kind of funny they actually found a phone number for a BBS you know those old things prior to the internet fucking loved BBS's do yes you can't fucking trade wars 2002 what or was it 2020 I don't remember but you know all those fucking games were amazing but I should have the red fucking dragon enough said and then on of course those BBS's they found you know ASCII art featuring some stuff looks like different robots and whatever from possibly portal to very interesting looking some apparently this is going to be some sort of ARG type of thing so that'll be kind of neat and then I just realized not all our chatters know what a BBS is God I feel old I'm really fucking sorry for not explaining it but BBS's ok back before there was the internet or if you want to get technical the internet existed them but it was only for fucking government people and stuff so back when like I was in fucking high school and probably about the time with the board system is you would have to dial in with a modem some guy would fucking hosted on their computer or gal and you would dial in on your modem and connect to it and then it was kind of like it had forums and a lot of the stuff that you kind of see in a new forum on the internet today but you know is a very community type of thing you didn't usually talk to people because you know people didn't want to call long distance and run up their phone bill so it's a very local thing usually yeah like I mean back in the day we have this free publication that was around called California computer news I fucking remember that man BBS's in the back BBS was seen in the back yeah you can you dial up I mean this is back in the day was ZZT and I download ZZT and I mean this is back also in the day when you know they had shareware which is you know kind of like you will take you 45 minutes to download the fucking Wolfenstein 3d like a demo you know for a game not really even a demo for game but it'd be like the first episode for a game would be like about five bucks or whatever you would go you know buy a floppy disk from you know whatever retailer and you would have the first it'd be a full game but it wouldn't be like the full full game you'd actually go buy a new retail game but give you a really good idea what the game is like and you could go on these servers and sometimes they would host the full version of the game and you could download it for free or like you know I would download you know back before mp3s you know mod files and stuff like that you know different electronica you synthesize Amiga music files and stuff like that so they would have you all sorts of stuff and I remember actually the first time that there was mp3s I was like holy shit was an mp3 so that's kind of cool but yeah back in the day you used to go in there and you could sometimes it also have it where you could host like you know multiplayer doom games online stuff like that I remember that into online this was you know back in the day with you this was all that we had it was not the internet it was like which bbs can you get into and you know what cool files that they have on there and you know I had to download them in the Y protocol or the Z protocol X protocol yeah most people don't know the hell I'm talking about as ways you download stuff it wasn't as easy as click a file and it downloads speaking of mod files because I apparently perked some years up in chat there was an epic fucking gauntlet theme mod that was out there on the internet was like one of my favorite mod files ever it was the music files I don't know what mod stand for music something something but I believe it was want to see what mode tracks it was Commodore based but you know the PC had a lot of support for it too they had like s3m which is like scream tracker there basically it's it's tracker things like it was like MIDI where the MIDI you trigger your different instruments that are hard coded into your graphics you're not graphics or your sound card well mods what they were is it was basically different sample files like WAV files that you put in there and it was triggered like MIDI was so you would have like new people could record their voice record like actual guitars and stuff like that and it would be triggered and you could create new electrical music or electronic music with that alright anything else you want to say about portal before we go to the next anyways yeah so they get back in the portal yeah there's some pretty cool stuff coming out they also added an extended ending to portal which kind of made it creepy you may remember if you finish the game a lot of people have you end up kind of at outside while you know the whole lab kind of falls out of the sky because it exploded well this extra ending that they've added 15 seconds it's all thank you for you know you know thank you for going into like was at the escort posture whatever escort position yeah the further your party yes well yes escort party position or something like that and you you're getting like dragged away by your head it's kind of crazy very creepy but like all hinting towards portal to which they already did announce that there's gonna be a portal to I believe and if they haven't well well there's big fucking done of course portal to me it was the best fucking game that came out that year you know yes of course is gonna be one and of course it was already confirmed by Game Informer their cover is actually portal to and it shows kind of looks like after science was just like all these vines and stuff growing from the outside you kind of in through portals and stuff like that what's going to be kind of unique about it the game will be coming out on a PlayStation or not PlayStation PC Xbox 360 and Mac platforms and it will be two-player co-op and it's gonna have it's gonna be a lot of fun interesting looking things in there so nice right if you want to learn more about that of course check out the latest game for one other first-person shooter news if you still can't fucking tear yourself away from Halo 2 you know how much time left it's still coming April 15th sorry guys your attempts to try and fucking change their mind haven't worked because they are shutting it down April 15th but Microsoft is being really fucking nice and extending an olive branch to those of you clinging to Halo 2 if you are still clinging to Halo 2 you might want to check your inbox because Microsoft might have offered you a beta test for Halo reach three months of Xbox Live Gold and 400 Microsoft points now if you think oh shit I should run online and play Halo 2 real quick sorry you're probably not going to get it now they probably did it for people that had played you know X number of hours in the past month but still kind of pretty fucking cool Microsoft to do I suppose it's better than what they're required to do which is nothing so I'm sure there's a lot of people that are going to be fucking happy that they can get some bonuses there if they're not too fucking pissed off about Halo 2 going away so there you go what would be really fucking nice of Microsoft to do would be to just say you know if you want to run your own private servers here you go but I guess you can't really do that on the Xbox 360 and Halo 2 is not going away on the PC something to remember so if you really want to cling cling to your halo 2 for dear life remember you can't always play on the PC speaking of clinging to things for dear life dark Sakura every week likes to jump into the fucking vault and pull out some really fucking old and moldy game that she says you know what you should be playing this game this week so it's the classic fucking game of the week dark Sakura what game did you pick this week for the kids I picked fucking Contra I haven't done it yet figured why the fuck not in Europe it was called Gris or and it was put up by Konami it was originally on the arcade and came out for the NES which for the PAL region came out as probotector excuse me I burped on the mic um and it also came out for the MSX 2 and they're a bunch of sequels because I mean who doesn't remember Super C right um so basically you were these guys called Bill and Lance who work for a red falcon and are trying to stop an alien invasion and Bill and Lance like to run around with those shirts on and carrying big guns they wear vests Rob that's not the game and and head and we're headbands they do I can't help it if it's not about fucking um so yeah you can get a bunch of different um guns you get a machine gun laser gun a fire gun a spread gun rapid firepower up all kinds of different fun stuff and then you also besides having the typical side scrolling levels you also have a behind the back sort of 3d maze level where you have to go in a certain order and shoot go through the bases defenses and get to the end and it's really fucking hard I mean seriously it's hard if you don't use the Konami code and have somebody else playing with you and you can beat this game without dying I I want to meet you and have you like sign my arm or something why why are in chat is trying to show off his big fucking skills sand cleared both Contra and Super C on NES without 10 or 30 lives and without continues who else yeah but did you die I want to meet the person who can do it without dying can't Dan do it without dying mmm no actually on it fucking thought he could I thought that's why you fucking married him no it was our type that he could beat without ah got you but also came out on this ZX spectrum Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC by the way I need to ask you about Commodore 64 stuff Rob I fucking love the Commodore 64 you have a good emulator ah I haven't used one in a long time I'm hoping the game room is gonna bring back some of the C64 stuff it's because we've done a pretty shitty job it's for someone else okay um but yeah they all came those versions all came out in Europe in 1988 the piece the IBM PC version was also out in Germany the Commodore 64 and IBM versions later came out in North America as Contra but yeah the the NES version was evil and hard and it was one of the earliest games to use the Konami code which one of the other games that did it was you know before that was of course Gradius and for the Falmicon it used a multi memory controller that Konami made for of course the Japanese market that gave it additional graphical effects so I don't know if anyone's ever played ROM of this but if you play the Japanese ROM the um there's animation in the background and other stuff going on the leaves are moving and the grass is blowing in the wind and all kinds of fun stuff and it also had extra cheat codes like a stage select and a sound test and hidden post credits scene that you would hold select and start before and during the entire end credits and yeah like I said the European version was called Pro Protector and the main guys were turned into robots and it was just because of censorship laws in the day fuck censorship but when Contra legacy of war and shattered soldier came out they retained the Contra name msx2 was actually fairly different than the arcade and the NES version because of limitations in the hardware it didn't scroll but it used flip screens sort of the way that Metal Gear and Vampire Killer did and it was only single-player however it did have it did change the last ten stages of the game and the msx2 version of Contra is on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan came out on February 2nd of this year of course there was a ps2 re-release version for Xbox Live arcade digital eclipse handled the conversion there's Konami classics series arcade hits for the DS blah blah blah blah blah and you can actually get the Konami's collector series Castlevania and Contra for Windows in North America which also includes Super C and three Castlevania games and if you get Contra IV Contra and Super C on is also included as the DS so yeah pretty pretty freaking hard and of course there were a ton of Contra games came after there was a Super Contra well Super C well it was Super Contra overseas it was Super C here operation C for the Gameboy Contra 3 the Alien Wars for Super NES Contra Force furnace Contra hardcore which that's really actually kind of hard to on Genesis Konami I love the Super Nintendo one that was awesome Konami contracted out for PlayStation Contra Legacy of War which also came out on the Saturn see the Contra adventure in 1998 2000 we had a Contra Shattered Soldier and Neo Contra Contra IV came out on the Nintendo DS and Contra Rebirth by M2 came out for WiiWare our old fucking pal like Kiryamoka did the music for Shattered Soldier Soldier if I remember right yes he did and also if you were looking for any of the soundtracks from the arcade version of Contra the soundtrack is included on Konami game music volume for Ajax which came out in 1988 there's actually a vinyl version of that Rob that's fucking old yeah so yeah Contra all right like yeah great choice and the chat rooms very fucking pleased with that Contra is your classic game of the week also I totally recommend watching the angry Nintendo nerd or angry gamer nerd his review of Contra it's freaking hilarious all right we're gonna take a quick fucking break we'll be back with more of orange lounge radio in just a little bit so fucking don't go anywhere we'll be right back perhaps one of the most interesting words in the English language today is the word fuck out of all of the English words that begin with a letter F fuck is the only word that is referred to as the f-word it's the one magical word just by its sound can describe pain pleasure hate and love fuck as most words in the English language is derived from German the word frickin which means to strike in English fuck falls into many grammatical categories as a transitive verb for instance John fucked Shirley as an intransitive verb surely fucks its meanings not always sexual it can be used as an adjective such as John's doing all the fucking work as part of an adverb surely talks to fucking much as an adverb enhancing an adjective surely is fucking beautiful as a noun I don't give a fuck that's part of a word abso fucking lutely or in fucking credible and as almost every word in a sentence fuck the fucking fuckers as you must realize there aren't too many words with the versatility of fuck as in these examples describing situations such as fraud I got fucked at the used car lot dismay off fuck it trouble I guess I'm really fucked now aggression don't fuck with me buddy difficulty I don't understand this fucking question inquiry who the fuck was that dissatisfaction I don't like what the fuck is going on here incompetence he's a fuck-off dismissal why don't you go outside and play hide and go fuck yourself I'm sure you can think of many more examples with all of these multi-purpose applications how can anyone be offended when you use the word we say use this unique flexible word more often than your daily speech it will identify the quality of your character immediately say it loudly and proudly fuck you welcome back to orange lounge radio on this very special edition in celebration of our State Assembly wasting their fucking time passing a resolution to celebrate no cussing week even if it did fail in the Senate it's still a waste of fucking everybody's time hey dark Sakura hmm why don't you play go play hide and go fuck yourself that's okay I love that clip that's a good clip I'm keeping that one in the podcast haters gonna hate all right we got some fucking rapid-fire news for you guys tonight a lot of quick fucking stories that we want to make sure we cover it was actually a pretty fucking busy news week so there's some pretty heavy hitters here so by the way I hear we're on against the fucking Oscars tonight I mean who gives a fuck about a bunch of Hollywood people uppity fucks just sucking each other's dicks and giving each other awards I forgot to submit my Oscar pics for a new okay so get this at my work we have this you know Oscar pool that we fucking do every year and every fucking year forget that submit him I had it done my co-worker fucking reminded me I get home like god damn it I fucking forgot him again on my desk it's not that fucking hard this year I like damn it it's a two fucking movie race even though they upped it to ten it's two who cares who cares about the Oscars hurt locker is gonna win doesn't matter doesn't fucking matter and beside you don't the fucking watching it on the internet later it's like four hours I do with American Idol results shows you don't watch him you just fucking read who wins what does they waste all the fucking ties well loses that's my man all right why why ours like oh but what are they wearing OMG look at that gown it's so daring look at how much skin they're burying yeah it'll all be on fucking Perez Hilton and and oh no they didn't and the OMG blogs all the fashion shit tiger claws been keeping me updated care what well sending you private messages or something yeah you really get you fucking care about the Oscars I care and see what Star Trek wins it's only gonna win makeup because as the only thing it was nominated for but that is the first win for a Star Trek movie oh I didn't know that I thought even fucking nemesis got nominated at least for like visual effects like I said the first win I see um but actually I do have to agree that avatar did deserve best cinematography what the fuck ever let's get some fucking video game news Loki yes let's talk about some fucking sequels including scribble knots to that's right coming from the fucking source for Nintendo news Nintendo fucking power there will be another scribble that's game and how can they fucking put another one you may ask because there are so many words that were in there before because the first fucking game sold like fucking hotcakes and it was a huge DS game well here's how they're gonna fucking do it they're gonna add 10,000 more words that's right 10,000 words that's fucking more than 9,000 that's over 9,000 words just giving me they were missing fucking 9,000 words apparently gonna be all internet me me's this time I don't know but apparently adjectives will play a big role this time like you guys summon super Einstein or electric werewolf mmm surprising versus electric werewolf I like that baby Cthulhu baby Cthulhu fuck yeah the shit out of me anyways it'll deliver apparently a hundred over 9,000 yes over 9,000 deliver 120 new levels a level editor a new hint system and improved controls well better have improved controls because those controls so how about actual controls first another not too surprising sequel in fact I've known about this for a little bit so calm for being announced for PlayStation 3 by zipper the company developed it the last time around for so calm confrontation but this is an actual sequel this time and apparently it's going to deliver 14 missions with about 12 hours of gameplay and of course you know the developer has a pretty good track record when it comes to multiplayer games seen as they were behind mag which had 256 players however the game will only have 32 player online multiplayer and then this is great apparently at the 11th hour Ubisoft has made some emergency changes to their DRM on their PC titles apparently great topic for the fuck show apparently there was there was some fixes that needed to be make because people were figuring out how to crack it and of course they've already cracked it but Ubisoft says that players should live should players lose their internet connection a requirement under the company's ridiculous new DRM scheme their single-player offline game would drop upon reloading you be left with your last checkpoint and not the actual point you were cut out now their claim is that no the you know the DRM has not been broken in fact those who are playing the cracked version out there aren't getting the full game experience and the words are not gain access to the you play stuff which no one gives a shit and to kind of go along with this in kind of the worst-case scenario situation well the worst-case scenario situation happened and apparently their servers went offline their Ubisoft DRM often to kid authentication servers they've been down and guess what apparently people that had Assassin's Creed 2 can't play it right now dole and I smell a fucking class-action lawsuit and apparently yes and it's been down for quite a long time and you know there's been people trying to log in for like 25 minutes and there are any able to do anything and a new be soft representative apparently responded to the forum thread that's over on their official Assassin's Creed 2 forum and saying clearly the extended downtime and lengthy login issues are unacceptable particularly as I've been told these servers are constantly monitored well they apparently watch them go down yeah fuck that up didn't you I'm honoring them crushing and then they added I'll do whatever what I can to get more information on this issue and here's the fruit or more on what the issue is first thing tomorrow and push for a resolution is sure it's this will happen again in the future it doesn't matter they've already cracked it forget about it because what apparently happened is there is a cracker group out there that figured out that hey guess what they have some sort of fail-safe and then in the case that will be soft size to go out of business that will put out a patch that will apparently disable this DRM so that you can play your game just fine well guess what the codes in there and they've activated it so thanks to be soft you made it easy we all knew this is gonna fucking happen and we all knew it's a stupid idea and guess what it's a stupid idea is it a fucking stupid idea it's a fucking stupid idea it's the worst idea ever because all you're doing is punching the people that legitimately paid for the program the people that want to hack it they're gonna wait for a hack version to come out I don't think there's a PC title out there that they haven't figured out a way around some sort of DRM for it so oh well you know you tried you failed maybe you shouldn't try because it cost money to try alright so a lot of fucking confusion going on over a highly fucking controversial game six days and fallujah you might remember this game was supposed to fucking come out and it doesn't like one fucking Konami actually put it out because I was putting out and they're like now we don't have fucking be associated with this because they're working with terrorists or something they're also working with the soldiers that were there and that wasn't gonna fucking stop atomic games and apparently IGN reported this week that six days and fallujah is finished it's fucking done it is ready to come out but there's no fucking release date announced just that the game is sitting there finished now atomic games actually fucking followed up to this saying that well IGN yeah they talked to somebody at atomic games and the game is finished and it's coming out but yeah we have another fucking game we're doing first and then six days and fallujah will come out it's finished but that doesn't mean we're not gonna fucking upgrade it new fucking features a new fucking technology and whatever the fuck we feel like doing basically in a nutshell so I keep an eye on atomic games I suppose if you really want more information on this game although I don't know the you know how you know that old saying strike when the iron is hot yeah well it's like you know the iron is frozen yeah put away anyhow on some other fucking news if you still one of these people that don't have a fucking Wii for some reason Walmart can sell you the bundle that everybody fucking thought would be out already Walmart is selling we owe we in Nintendo we Wii Sports Wii Sports Resort and the motion plus attachment it's available right now one hundred and ninety nine dollars is the price for this so basically it's a normal we thing with Wii Sports Resort with it which you know although Walmart I don't know they can kind of be fucking shady about some things like I don't know censorship on albums a good deal is still still a good deal and if you do not have a Nintendo Wii for whatever reason you want to be limited supplies as if the supplies aren't limited enough already yeah so and one of the fucking thing I have for you guys before I turn it over to dark Sakura Tecmo Bowl there is a new Tecmo Bowl coming it's a new old Tecmo Bowl it's a fucking throwback I am actually fucking excited about this I don't talk a lot about sports games on this show because I don't fucking play a lot of them cuz I know it's gonna sound weird but a lot of them are too fucking complicated for me cuz I don't watch a lot of them on TV but I like the kind of overly simplified ones like NBA Jam I always love that game in the fucking arcades and this new one is somewhat interesting I fucking love Tecmo Bowl on the NES I thought it was great so the idea that they're kind of doing this throwback I find very fucking exciting this will it feature real sugar this time I don't know the idea of this was kind of leaked a little while ago thanks to an ESRB rating but now it's been acknowledged Tecmo Bowl throwback is coming out on the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network sometime in the spring it's a remake of Tecmo Super Bowl you can switch to classic 2d amongst I guess the 3d the people who fucking made it are south and interactive they also made that fucking loadrunner game and our type the loadrunner ever fucking come out on the Xbox 360 yeah sometime ago the R type ones pretty fucking rad if that's the R type that's on Xbox Live I think it's probably the r-10 fucking rad so this is a good studio to be doing this all new 3d graphics and and and online play fuck yeah Tecmo Bowl throwback will have 32 teams online leaderboards and customizable options for the teams and the rosters I don't know like are these are they gonna be actual teams or no because every fake teams the fake teams like just they're called New York and Denver but it's not like fucking the New York of the Denver still I'm all over I bet you never thought you would hear me say this about a sports game here on OLR I am all fucking about this game I am I'm very excited to fucking play this game dark soccer has got a few stories for us and then some Twitter topics I sure fucking do rock band we are getting some songs white stripes pack which will be for 40 points $5.50 fell in love with the girls seven nation army and you don't know what love is you just do as you're told individual tracks the future has decent days and nights hounds of love this wasn't that a Kate Bush song anyway the James gang walk away Neil pert the hockey theme and Seamus all of this and tie you down and other news there is a K something that was given to me as an incomplete link that I have no idea what it is um DJ max technica 2 has a teaser out so I guess people can go watch it and then the 8-bit left for dead dude is doing Megaman 9 HD remix so keep your eyes open for that although I bet nobody's gonna ever fucking play it cuz there'll be a lawsuit that'll stop it if they ever try to put that out cuz that's just the fucking way the world works I'll try course it's not Activision it's a Capcom who knows maybe they'll be a little cooler but I don't know I kind of think you know okay fucking Megaman 10 came out on the fucking weed this week right and I'm fucking waiting for PSN or Xbox 360 before I spend my fucking hard-earned money on this game but I'm kind of hearing a lot of the early fucking feedback is that it's kind of just Megaman 9 all over again and I'm kind of fucking thinking well wasn't Megaman 9 just the first fucking eight games all over again I mean that's what the charm was about it has the fucking retro ness of Megaman worn off is is retro really fucking old now I don't know what do you think Loki is is is Megaman 10 too much or what I don't think it's too much I think you know it'd be pretty cool to see them release more of these retro games promise they're just not as good as Megaman 2 but I don't know I'm kind of glad that they're doing that because it really it comes down to those games prove that it's all about gameplay it's not necessarily graphics and you don't have to have really shiny HD 3d you know modeled graphics for a Megaman game or even a lot of games it can be just fine with just you know 8-bit retro stuff and that hell I'd like to see a studio that only did that that'd be pretty awesome I think Dark Touch Studio raises a fucking good point in chat saying well I don't think Capcom would want people playing the equivalent of one of their recent releases for free yeah I can see that they're still probably making some fucking money off Megaman 9 and so yeah they would shut this shit down if it was getting out there too much but I don't think it's a bad thing you know why not you know now that they kind of did the fucking retro 3d just go in and make some HD sprites keep the same game keep the same just just or even pretty or even pretty you know what you could do and here's what they really need to do you need to put fucking Megaman 9 and Megaman 10 like on the DS or something like that so I can take it with me and play that shit you know I mean those ROMs got to be pretty small anyways that aside or new Megaman collection would be kind of cool with those in there fuck let's make them if they want to make a 3d game make them another fucking Megaman Legends that would be fucking awesome alright let's get to some Twitter topics suit you fucking people on Twitter have to say every week we read your tweets show us your tweets at OLR lots of fucking celebration that finally a year and a half after I think the idea was first announced we are finally having our fucking fuck show up against the Oscars tonight in a moment of protest not everybody fucking on board with the fuck show though sturlock sends us a tweet to be perfectly honest this joke is already painfully old it's not gonna be for everybody keep in mind we're not just doing it to say fuck a lot which although I will say that's a nice benefit but it is a protest against people taking their time to time out of their busy schedules they should be balancing budgets to tell us that we shouldn't swear that swearing makes us somehow unintelligent it's the same fucking show tonight just more fuck but I don't know I was a little worried coming into it it might get fucking old after three hours but we'll see two hours and I still feel pretty fucking good you guys doing okay all right let's see spazzinator says some very nasty words to Sony I got I bet yeah I bet he'll call in later and say some more about that but also says let's see if I got this right this is in response to the heavy rain thing spazzinator PSN says let's see if I got this right heads blown off fine hot crowbar up the ass fine mass murder fine tits or badge what sicko wants to see that fucking shit dude it's like the biggest like I don't even know what word you would say to describe this just it's it's just this big glaring hypocrisy in in the media and in society that has been going on for a very long time it's not just fucking video games but it's movies too what's that movie there was some movie about like it's called this movie is rated R or something like that it explores like the NC 17 rating fucking fascinating dark touch to you once everyone to fucking know that I love this song resumes this week on the site that's good I like seeing some more fucking content on olr hopefully there's more than just the I love that song segment which was you know everything that was on the website but I do I like music gaming music is good and so I always like the I love that song segment the diversity of stuff that they picked so fuck yeah and lastly Takeo Ray says his tweet wants to know so does anyone have an f-bomb count for the show I think they lost track in the first fucking like five minutes problem was Dark Sakura sat there went fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck and that's faster than anyone could probably tally so that's more of something that you'll figure out later on once they the podcast comes fucking out hey if every if anyone actually wants to sit there and fucking count all the words I'm pretty fucking impressed and I mean I doubt it Guinness will pay attention to something like this because it's just a fucking podcast but hey they'll pay attention to like what the longest pretzel is or some shit like that I don't fucking get them both of the shit that they fucking record is ridiculous maybe we can get sure me to hey maybe we can buy the gaming podcast or another game fight because the gaming Guinness World Records think well we haven't started talking about the tester yet I did watch episode 2 of the tester oh was it worth a Shermie poop yes I still feel the same about it it's you know it's not the most terrible thing to ever reach my television but it's no RuPaul's Drag Race which would be the best thing to ever grace my television it's it's a big what the fuck ever it's a three out of five through Paul drag races um it should have to lip-sync for its life I do think that is something I don't know it's pretty obvious that they fucking film this whole show in the scope of like three or four days like like they're doing a little challenge in the morning kick somebody off to a challenge in the evening kick somebody off to it was really fucking fast I'm sure whatever just as $5,000 dude I'd go on the tech like if it's just like four days or whatever to film the show I'd fucking go on the tester win the $5,000 and then quit fuck you I'm out of here all right I'm not gonna be a fucking tester you'll pay shit there if they were willing to pay I'm not gonna say what I make of my current job now but if they're willing to match that I do it although I don't know like if they had it I gotta be fucking honest if instead the competition was like be the new host of PlayStation shows or something like that I would give that some serious fucking thought because I'd be like oh I could get do something I really like for a living that might be worth it you know money don't buy everything I think if the contest were be the next fucking PlayStation host of fucking yeah ever they would probably have like I just like be the spokesperson for something and I'd you know compete in that and win and then the surprise at the end by the way you get to be a spokesperson for Apple god damn it Bo fuck you it to call one our chat room chat that orange laundry calm said episode four of the tester is supposed to be larping oh god that's gonna be awesome oh well I'm only through the second episode I just watched it in you know waste time people who were doing the live-action avatar roleplay themselves blue and they were legit they've got a website in a group in everything I have fucking heard about these people that that are depressed after they watch fucking avatar because they they want to fucking live on Pandora like it's fucking real okay I larped but I put vampire and you know what we didn't go running out in the woods acting stupid we just ran around downtown mobile acting stupid all right let's move on with some more fucking gaming news then the mailbag then your fucking calls which I'm sure are gonna be a hoot and a holler tonight can't fucking wait for that remember every call counts all right we might have to institute the time limit on calls tonight I think we're gonna do that I think we're gonna do rapid-fire calls tonight just so everybody can have their say because I know everybody wants to get a rapid-fire call everyone gives a fuck rapid-fire calls tonight I'm already too long we hang up on you know what though instead of getting three calls we could get through like seven if we do a time limit so we're gonna do that tonight all right uh Loki some fucking gaming news for us this also has nothing to fucking do with the PlayStation Network going well the PlayStation are technically didn't go down but you know PlayStation 3 is it way back in late 2008 apparently a Pennsylvania teenager playing SOCOM US Navy SEALs got kicked out of a tournament for using a cheat mod so he decided to take revenge by crashing the PlayStation website for 11 days and what's funny though is Sony has decided you know what they filed a federal grand jury investigation which led to the perpetrator getting arrested the hacker pled guilty to four felony charges in juvie court and apparently he got access he said he apparently got access to the site servers and let loose a virus that brought everything down and his methods I guess weren't described but some experts or whatever contacted by local TV station said they were so sophisticated that someone else couldn't pull it off hopefully by now they've already fixed that stuff apparently also it says in exchange the team pleaded guilty the four counts and lawful use of a computer criminal use of computer computer trespassing and distribution of a computer virus in exchange for a process prosecutors dropping the 11 others some related to the March 2009 cyber-attack that's funny no team funnier is he's from La Trobe which we have a road over here named La Trobe but this is all Pittsburgh new Pennsylvania I actually know where that is in Pennsylvania not just Pittsburgh but what they're talking about well you know boo-fucking-hoo for this kid he got what he deserved honestly you know she didn't hack the website kicked out you got kicked out for fucking cheating you fucking deserved it he thought he was leaked hacks or boo-hoo I got banned for cheating when have fun in the fucking slammer on to happier news a really fucking cute fucking game on the PlayStation 3 little big planet who doesn't love little big planet it's so fucking adorable lots of people do apparently enough to make two million two million user creators pretty fun stuff on there there's some levels that were like really difficult levels I forget what they're called though but oh man we were busting up there like on some of the top rated user levels just go through playing those there's some really funny fucking levels on there and this shouldn't really come as a big fucking surprise but Media Molecule has now been absorbed fully as a first party company for Sony so Sony is now suck them up into their collective and Media Molecule now has their fucking check signed by Sony so there it is it's Dan Media Molecule is no longer an independent studio and by the way a comment from Michael Denny the senior vice president of Sony worldwide studios quote Media Molecule will simply continue to make great games welcoming Media Molecule into the PlayStation family will allow us to better support their future titles and ambitions they're really fucked now just kidding I added that last part myself all right and Dan yelled from the living room that's only if Activision buys them boy if Activision comes for your company run bitch run I can't say me I can't wait for them to close Blizzard that'll be the day dark soccer would you got for us well yeah there was a version of a number of different Nintendo games some of them super rare that were going on eBay there was one in particular family fun fitness stadium events it hit a bid amount of eight hundred thousand two hundred dollars fucking eBay yeah scammers you'd like anybody who has that much money to blow on an NES game which is actually the highest game on there right now is bubble bath babes with the box for two thousand nine hundred and ninety five dollars and let me say every fucking penny I'll offer what I'll offer a one cent bid on it I don't think you can put a one cent bid when you have to do three thousand best offer five bucks only off topic here just thought I'd mention this because it's not fucking allowed okay well this is going back to the fucking sir we had about during rapid-fire about the Ubisoft DRM here's why their server went down do the exceptional demand we're currently expert experiencing difficulties yes that's right because their games sold and people bought them and then try to play them and it logs in online it caused server strain and therefore it's not work so basically if you buy their games it breaks the server why don't they just fucking say it's a DDoS attack because that's clearly what's going on right it's not it's just from people playing their games don't you think that's just a blow to bullshit just know it's a face if they're just stupid exceptional demand could be a bunch of inquiries to their server I think they're being DDoSed which isn't okay I think that's fucked up like I don't think it's even worse if that's the case oh dude the exceptional demand well that will be a problem going forward okay I would you don't fucking take all these statements at face value though because look at what Sony said earlier this week we fix the fucking date problem no you didn't you waited it out you fucking waited it out and then put out a press release about how fucking awesome you are to fix the problem in exactly 24 hours come on we weren't born yesterday due to exceptional demand you know what your your fucking DRM is about as in demand as a fucking Yanni CD at Lollapalooza okay that's how fucking in demand your thing is anyhow more news than the mailbag that's just funny oh sorry so this is kind of cool rock band network finally launched in rock band network you may remember is kind of an extension of the XNA where anybody that has a membership to the XNA can basically download the tools that they need to convert their music into rock band tracks and then you can go ahead and sell them online well they launched with 105 songs which is fucking awesome try that guitar hero seriously or DJ hero don't even get me started DJ hero to download packs yeah I should have figured no but seriously compared this to what they have for you know it's our hero where they have their basic service you can create your own tracks and throw them on there for free download but this is like way better and 105 tracks launch so far the song ranges from price ranges are about 80 to 160 Microsoft points or a buck or two and you know just kind of some of the artists that are on here that I thought were pretty cool flogging Molly's on here with drunken lullabies the live version and requiem for a dying song cam FDM with a drug against war and jute joint Jezebel to joy because it was awesome sense off we didn't make a little maniacal though you know in due time maybe MC front a lot with goth girls I love that song also a little bit of Jonathan Colton in there including creepy doll IKEA in the future soon another two bunch of good songs and then you know a bunch of other artists I don't recognize what a lot of other people might was it the shins Australia I recognize the shins there's some other artists the main drag see here scratching the itch whatever but tons of stuff and there's gonna be more added each day as you know this goes on definitely worth checking out they are exclusive on the xbox 360 for 30 days after which a selection of standout tracks will become available on the PlayStation 3 and the week I think a well our should have a fucking song on there like I don't know we don't really have any we don't do music really but I I think we should just we should have a fuck it's not an original song yeah we have to come up with an OL our original song do we know any fucking songwriters that could write us a fucking song that we just scream the lyrics to over some like type of music I guess I have some type of guitar thing they can play like an epic guitar solo and a drum solo that we could all sing come on does you guys wanna fucking sing a song on Rock Band Network can't maybe not it's just we cost a lot take a lot of time I'm not that talented all right if someone wants to put all that effort and work into it yeah sure I got one more story for you guys and then we can get to the fucking mailbag this has to do with an update to the code of conduct I gotta be honest although I'm sure this probably pissed me off when I first fucking heard about it I totally fucking forgot about it until this story came out this week that apparently Xbox Live has now lifted the ban on using the terms lesbian gay bi transgender and straight in your profiles so if you want to put hi I like games and I'm a big lesbian in your profile it is okay to do that now so have a ball and I talked a little bit about this on Bobby Black Wolf show tonight you know he's the show before us at all games radio he's a much cleaner show than we are by the way he is always kind enough to do a call with us and I was coming on how fucking like you know I want to see Bobby I want to see Bobby do a fuck show man I want to see him just go off one night sound like a Bobby unhinged although he well he swears on his other show Friday night gaming but you know that's such a video show that there's a lot of pause that you like if you're listening to it as a radio show there's a lot of pauses because they're doing things on video they're playing games and stuff it makes sense I just like to see Bobby just just go off for an hour like I can't fucking believe this fucking I'd love it awesome anyway I'm Bobby Shaw I was talking about this a little bit and I was just saying like you know okay yeah I'm a I'm a gay guy and I I don't think I really care that I can put this in my profile now especially on Xbox Live of all places I don't want to put like I'm a gay gamer 31 from California like it's not fucking match.com or whatever it's business why do people make that such a big deal I mean yeah it's a part of your identity but it's not like I go around saying hi I like everybody but I also agree that if someone wants to do it they should have every right to I just don't I just don't understand why you do it but okay if you want to put it on your profile you should have every right without repercussion and people you know but you're probably gonna get all these messages from losers going what your affairs should put in my profile send me boob photos you know cuz it would be okay to put in your profile I that's well in my right big supporter I've been right you could do it supporter of lesbian boobs you go what that would be okay so there you go have fun with your profiles and so forth dude that's someone else I got a following Twitter what oh one of my friends on the live journal they have Tom Selleck an icon I'm like Tom Selleck that'd be awesome wonder if he's on Twitter every fucking buddies on Twitter now it's crazy then there might be this is my PSA for today and it's your random here I can go everybody needs to follow Steve Gutenberg poor guy only has 25 friends I mean that's not any way to treat a guy that was marginally good in some 80s films link that link the Twitter in chat we will double the number tonight let the Twitter in chat chatters or gels radio love Steve Gutenberg I can know what to do you need to follow this guy hasn't the cat approves of Steve Gutenberg we know it's three men and a fucking baby do we know it's really him I don't know it's the only Steve Gutenberg on Twitter so so it must be it must be who'd want to impersonate Steve Gutenberg uh nobody well let's see who's following him Loki I'm on there not many actual guys look it up on Twitter link it in chat alright chatters you know what to do it's Steve Gutenberg fuck follow him I'm gonna look and see if there's a Steve underscore Gutenberg all right moving on let's get to the mailbag you gotta stop looking for me we mean nope yes no there's not an underscore Steve don't you say no to the emailers I just followed him so whatever I'm feeling such a man she I'll go fucking follow him too all right here we go the emails every week you send us your fucking emails and we read him he has an official website so we'll figure it out on there www.orange lounge radio.com is our website and I think there's an email link there or just open up your email browser and go mailbag at orange lounge radio.com read us oh yeah I'm sorry I the emails were hidden under yahoo japan stuff okay what are you fucking doing on yahoo japan I'll tell you after the show why can't you tell me during the show is it juicy fuck off okay okay this comes from Jammer Jay whoa okay um who by the way sent me a very nice Christmas Christmas card with um a sudoku puzzle in it and um isn't it fucking March and you're just now getting a Christmas no he I got it it bounced back so yeah and um and um and um he sent like I think and I have judgment card or something anyway um here was a situation posed to me and I wanted to get all our thoughts on this since we are all about the same age here's the scenario my coworker gave me Dave and my other co-workers would put the money into a pot in order to win the pot I would have to stop playing all video games for a month I told him I would not do it and then it seemed a bit ridiculous to me Dave's reasoning was that my life would get immediately better and that I would be a better person and go out more the ironic thing was that we were dragged out to a country bar and shooting pool which I did not enjoy as much but I could do I think we were all met anyways being dragged there also like many others he seems he sees the gaming lifestyle as negative and he does not know even really what me like many others not in Idaho okay I do a large amount of gaming everything from Beatles rock band on 360 to World of Warcraft but I balance this out with my weekly workouts including DDR and my other grown-up things quotes I am NOT a poop soccer okay I believe that it is what makes us individuals to be different and that we can have different hobbies and interests different than others to enjoy life some of the activities that people think are normal drinking playing pool partying I have not done but I feel empty doing them even with others I would rather not conform and do what I enjoy by myself then to feel empty so what do you guys think is there anything else I should say to him to back up my point by the way in Idaho most what most consider normal is all outdoorsy stuff floating river hiking camping BSU football hunting I'm not from Idaho I'm a Floridian this email has been brought to you by red Robin the home of the delicious chop house burger now I'm fucking hungry for one of those Western chicken we went to federal records today I ate an ostrich burger yummy fucking delicious anyway um well first of all I know a lot of Floridians I lived about an hour from Pensacola and a lot of them were back were right very well rednecks um so yeah all the same stuff you know what just tell them like you know flat out say I'm an individual this is I'm not going to change myself to please you if he's your fucking friend he should understand that there's some fucking things whatever I mean it's hanging out going to country bars he's a friend of some some sort if he's your fucking friend you should understand there are things you like to do you're not hurting anyone playing a video game you're not doing nothing but playing video games you're holding down a steady job it's not anyone's place to tell another person how to live their life end of story that's all I think if you know what though I think here's here's my fucking suggestion if you're gonna do that for him he should play a video game with you and see what it is that you enjoy so much about video games I think if you're gonna do that and go to a country bar which props to you because I don't know how long I could stand something like that but I would do it for a friend if a friend really wanted me to go to a country bar for a night I would go but I think in return you should ask he should sit down play a video game with you and try to find a game that you think he might like I mean you know your friend better than I do you might find that new Super Mario Brothers Wii is a game or maybe Call of Duty modern warfare is the game up to you my friend but if this guy's really your friend like he should just take you as you are even if he's just a co-worker then if he's a co-worker then you get this whole other thing involved where if he's it's to the point where he's annoying you you have every right home stop talking to you honestly like then again that only really works in California I yeah I mean I would hate that you would have to go that far with it honestly just encourage him to be more open-minded and just let him know hey there's nothing wrong with video games dude call a modern warfare made more money than most Hollywood movies do I mean it is an art form I don't know I don't know this guy maybe follow fancy 13 and the stories would maybe maybe plays the deer hunter I don't know which that game is actually kind of funny um so anyway next fucking email dear olr I finished heavy rain last Sunday I wasn't affected by the ps3 clock glitch and was able to beat sorry beat off to and beat heavy rain with no problem at all Oh special person to me heavy rain is comparable to a show like rescue me mad men and burn notice but notice is pretty cool damn like to rescue me um these are shows that would have been absolutely dull to me when I was young teenager but really deep and compelling now that I have matured into more adult tastes do you feel the same way they're not shows that I enjoy but I see why people like them I mean like I said Dan loves rescue me I like Dennis Leary I mean I think he's pretty hilarious I watched the end of nip tuck this week it went out with a fizzle hmm it was just like there's like and we give up it was basically kind of I was really upset because there was no new RuPaul's drag race this week but there was a new project runway and I completely agreed with who they sent home is that what we're talking about I think it's talking about serious dramas dealing with the issues that people don't like to talk about I think there are certainly some shows I didn't really watch as a kid that I could fucking appreciate a little more now that maybe I couldn't appreciate because I was too young to understand I'm sure there were shows like that I can't think of anything off the top of my head but there's a few shows though that that grow up with you if you know what I mean like watching freaking Rocky and Bullwinkle or Beverly Hills 90210 I mean I can't watch that new one it's such bullshit compared to the old one I did I fucking grew up with Brandon and Brenda I mean they're my homeboys sorry I thought she was on the show now I think she did like a guest thing but it's not the same because now she's gonna be on the show yeah some of them are on the show there was one I watched God I watched some weird TV when I'm at home sometimes I watched this show overhauling it's basically one of those you know they take a car and soup it up type shows and they did one for what's his name in I remember the guy's name on 90210 yeah he is hearing in searing why do I know that yeah they did his uh I'm silently hitting my head in shame he was on Dancing with the Stars I think that yeah that's where they all finish reading email yeah yeah yeah also I need help with DJ hero I seem to be unable to perform the blue button scratch consistently and effectively it doesn't matter which hand I use or whether the buttons are on the left or right of the turntable controller I fail on the consistent basis are there any tips you can give me Loki I'm surprised it's the blue one that you're having trouble with that's the one that is on the inside of camera well what kind of surprises me is that he has the same problem even if he flips through the first thing I would have said is play left-handed mode it's probably inside one I'm guessing because it's hard to get a grip on it what you need to do is when you have your hand on the actual turntable is I normally put my thumb I rest my thumb on the outside on the actual edge of the turntable and use that to kind of move the turntable because if you just rely on you know the friction of your finger on that button it's not gonna work you have to keep your thumb held down to create that kind of like friction there or it's too loose and you'll get all these scratches you don't really want you have to use your thumb to I think that attraction that's where your problem comes in but maybe like I'm afraid we're gonna get a follow-up email like I'm already doing that well then you just need practice more you might just have to take down honestly take down the difficulty you might be playing on two I I think maybe you're me I don't know I'm guessing what I've been a longtime fan of Bahmani so you're trying to take it a little more aggressive I've been doing this but I haven't done it yet I've been meaning to take like aggressively it's an adverb whatever I don't like adverbs oh yeah we'll fuck you back we need to take like a metal plate or something like that and find the actual dead zones on each side you know whatever because there's little dead zones where you can actually move the marker and it'll finally move all the way over to the left and right and just put a plate there so that basically it's just all Center unless you go far right far left because I hate it where you just don't go far enough or something like that it doesn't register so that'd be kind of cool fucking play DJ hero in a while I really need to I'm kind of disappointed price of them at fries they have a ton of them I'm really fucking disappointed they didn't support it better with more DLC that's two download packs they are not trying at all there we release a couple now we're gonna release a new game they better throw my hair back at you three with DJ hero too well if I can finish the email of course you fucking can thank you for taking my question posting the podcast episodes in expedient manner stay care of entertainment this message has been brought to you by the following words fuck shit ass piss bitch dumbass cocksucker motherfucker damn you are quite fucking welcome also we you know what is that on our fucking wiki for what in show jokes this message has been brought to you by I don't know I haven't had it right the fuck now I have to be fucking honest I haven't read the fucking wiki in a while but I'm not just getting updated tonight with the whole fuck show business hey olr I was listening to last week's show and I heard Jamie state that she really did not want to discuss the crazy things going on with game crazy I couldn't figure out why until I found out her husband works for the company I'm a store manager for game crazy in Colorado and I think it would be interesting to hear the opinions and thoughts on what's going on especially coming from someone who works in a different district and region personally I am very concerned of what's going on and it would be interesting to chat about it on your show please do not use my name for obvious reasons but peas do respond I love your show look forward to downloading it every week keep it up thanks someone oh Jamie is summoning Dan to the olr studio live radio boys and girls it's always a fucking mess and you tape live Sunday nights at all games radio www.allgames.com we can hear fucking train wrecks the train wreck they also did get to hear my Dan voice but I can understand though if you don't want to fucking talk about it cuz it's a fucking day job but you know you don't want to put that shit at risk so I would completely fucking understand if the answer is no fucking comment well we can ask him so Dan a wild Dan has appeared we got an email from a listener in Colorado who is a game crazy manager and wants to know her him him and he wants to know what your thoughts are on it being from a different region if you want if you don't want to say anything on the show you don't have to about what about the closures and how you feel and about what might be happening being out of money sucks and stores closing sucks and if more of you fuckers would shop there instead of going to GameStop maybe we can stay no no it's not your guys's fault it's your guys's fault there's really not a lot to say you know the economy's tough a lot of good people have lost jobs a lot of good people are hanging on and Hollywood and movie gallery really mismanaged through that on a corporate level I've dealt with movie gallery and they're like exactly it's a company that like didn't catch on to trends that were stupidly obvious ten years ago that they could have done to avoid all this today and if you know if things have been done differently you know what it could have should have yeah yeah yeah you know as far as it goes now yeah it sucks that we're losing any competition for GameStop because GameStop's already bigger and evil er than it needs to be and that's you guys know that's true and that honestly enough that maybe if you know if if the bankruptcy works out which it won't and any of the game crazies end up staying open which they probably won't you know it would be really nice that the gamers will still have an alternative but you know to anyone else who works for the company hey I'm there with you it's rough I can't speak for them I'm gonna show up every day I mean you know try to help my gamers and you know I recommend they do the same if you have a game craze in your area and you haven't gone there hey this is it while it's there give it a chance and you know hopefully like it and if you don't go to hell maybe we should maybe we should do an SOS campaign save our stores well I appreciate Dan's perspective because you know there's some people that when it comes to the day job they'd be like I fucking touching that shit with a fucking ten-foot pole so I appreciate you sweetie being openly and candidly on the topic thank you sweetie support not just independent radio but support independent game stores even though game crazy isn't necessarily independent it's important to point out they're not Walmart and they're not GameStop so that's independent enough they're a fucking endangered species yes that's right they're like they're like a goddamn unicorn and I was close to independent kind that Loki's been playing with all week on that game so you go are there any more fucking you know I actually went and downloaded that song did you always hey we got another one from Jesus yay hello there oh this is Jesus I'm writing in I'm the Swedish dude who called in a few shows ago and talked about the DRM and said and seeing as how exams are closing in I can't did I read this one already it wasn't it really long and yeah yeah you did I did recent this so oh yeah and we also got one from Raba with the stuff about portal and the boing boing boing we already talked about they bought portal at Circuit City RAP when it was released a la carte I'll have to see what's all about viral marketing in its best dude orange box is only like $19.99 now right like it's really fun seriously what a fucking steal if you have an Xbox 360 or PC or whatever it's a good deal I really wish I am getting the game it's great I just didn't play it a lot moved on all right go back are you fucking done with the fucking emails yes all right then if you should send us your fucking opinion it's where every gamer has a voice to the game crazy guy so mail bag emailing him I'd be fucking curious you know whatever you can read on the show obviously mail bag at orange launch rated calm if you want to send us some fucking emails meanwhile it's time to do the F use of the week oh yeah we're still having them tonight just because it's a fuck show doesn't mean we've got orange boxes is 1999 1799 news we got a big story to inspire this tonight as if the whole fucking reason for tonight's show weren't enough reason to be angry let me give you a little something extra here a Korean couple this week has made the news for neglecting their infant to the point where the infant starved because they were addicted to online games at internet cafes now you might want to take this with a grain of salt because it's coming from the Sun but still sadly you could see it but I trust the Sun with all of its sunlight in nutrients here's the irony they were raising a virtual toddler in a game called Prius online it's pretty much second life but while they were doing this they'd leave their real one at home alone each day with just a bottle of milk for nourishment dude it's even worse than Clara from the guild at least like she's sitting in the same room with them one day they came home to find the child dead and called the cops claiming that they found them dead went to found the kid dead when they woke up investigators found though that the child was dehydrated and decided that the couple story was full of bullshit good for them just pathetic this is all disgusting honestly yeah I what else can you say this is just it's it's kind of sad you don't have to take an IQ test to reproduce like some days I really wish you had to take an IQ test in order to successfully have an orgasm oh I'm almost there I'm almost there okay what's 2 plus 2 die forget no baby anyhow if that doesn't inspire some angst within you then I don't know what else well dark soccer what's your F use of the week fuck you ever hacked my Gaia account um yeah I had about a million and cold stolen and some of my expensive items and yeah I play on it as sort of like a little oh I'm wasting time thing but it's just that it's just shitty you know and I want people to give me my money back so it's just completely horrible that's really it though I mean that and having no time to get my stuff finished looky I'm tired so this isn't as heartfelt as it was the beginning of the show but fuck you to the asshole that stole my 360 and my mod chip and my $60 that was gonna pay for installing the mod chip and wasting my entire day and making me have to drive down to Stockton because Stockton sucks and having to drive back from Stockton angry angry yes oh I was so pissed off and not only that waiting four hours in a car in front of an apartment complex which I assumed was his it might not be at this point I am going to email him this week though to give him a chance maybe there was some misunderstanding maybe his phone fucked up and he just didn't get any of my messages at the very end or maybe not or maybe not but hey I'm gonna give him an opportunity to ship me that console if he doesn't then we'll fucking post his email and his phone number all over the internet so good fucking luck yeah he has an iPhone I know that he pissed off a radio show host be warned I don't have a lot of F use this week I actually do have a big F you but it's not one I want to stay on the show because it's a sensitive matter so just F you to feeling underappreciated let's leave it at that that's it for the F use more fuck show a couple of fucking stories for you guys Loki what do you got on deck so apparently there's some fucking new design for the DS cartridge that's come out in a patent filing it looks like a new DS cartridge that's a little bit longer than the normal DS cartridge it's got I don't even know looks like almost like a button or something on the end of the cartridge there maybe either for like some sort of rewrite thing or possibly God knows if you ask me because it's hard to tell based just off this little picture but people are thinking that maybe it's some sort of expansion device that they're making for the DSI or something like that to allow you know other peripherals that you might use on say for example the Game Boy Advance slot like maybe new guitar hero type thing this makes me think of what is the rumble pack they put out for Pokemon pinball you know it kinda looks like to me almost like some sort of wireless card or something like that but the DS you already has wireless on it it's just that button on top you almost looks like a sinker some sort of device maybe a motion controller type thing something like that maybe the button resets you know the orientation or some shit like that who knows we'll find out later on it when this actually comes out whatever the hell it is that they're you know I don't know maybe around e3 sure it's gonna suck my fucking out why you gotta be so fucking negative we relax the Wii Vitality sensor mine that's why I gotta be fucking negative mine or the Wii Zapper hey let's let's make this really cool controller attachment nope now let's not let's just add a little plastic shell instead that looks like shit on plays like shit it is shit all right I got one more fucking story for you guys we're gonna open up the skype line a one eight seven seven game olr our username on skype is orange launch radio the three-minute rules in effect tonight phone calls will be limited to three minutes so that every fucking gamer can have a voice tonight valve games are on their way to the Macintosh that's right I guess there were some rumors about fucking steam going to the Macintosh cuz some fucking files that were found in the latest beta build but valve has basically hinted very strongly that the games are coming to the Mac I guess Doug Lombardi the VP of marketing over at valve actually kind of gave the official confirmation but no release dates or anything like that but it's a pretty fucking understood that Team Fortress 2 Half-Life Left 4 Dead portal those are all big big possibilities it should be noted Team Fortress 2 is used in some type of little campaign there that is kind of a parody of the Apple ads so some fucking Mac users are gonna be very fucking excited especially with a game like portal and you know all those games really valve makes some pretty fucking awesome games those are all gonna be worth playing yeah that's what's that they're pretty cool yep so even Loki can support that on the Mac more games for the Mac Loki that's all you ever wanted right I didn't want anything for the Mac and I don't care that's why they want to release more games to the Mac because there are people that buy those pcs I don't understand why but whatever you know make the money where they can I just want to share while Loki was reading his last fucking story I ran out to the fucking car by the way the Skype lines open go ahead and call one eight seven seven game all our I ran out to the fucking car to get more of these pita chips which you become really fucking addicted to but this is a different brand these are from Trader Joe's and these are reduced guilt because they're not as fatty sea salt chips and I've gotten Jamie addicted to them yay oh no I almost bought myself some not only is that the Stacy's brand is really good but these are really good too these are almost better in some ways and they have ones they have cinnamon and sugar ones at Trader Joe's too yes they do they have cheddar they have all the different flavors very fucking delicious I give props to pita chips hey our calls are coming in let's kick it off welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio fuck show who's this it's a fucking spazzinator hey fucking spazzinator it's been a long fucking time what's the latest with you and Sony well you know at least in my fucking opinion this whole clock you know fucking deal is you're putting another nail into the fucking coffin so you know it just seems like fucking so you can't do anything right so but on a positive note I did speak to Sony rep not too long ago and they gave me another story saying that yeah once I send my system in they'll you know if they have to send me another system they'll like reauthorize need to download all my videos well that's what that being said I'm sorry did you start to say something there no I was just gonna say at least they're offering that that seems like fucking more than you got before yeah well even with that being said I still say yeah pretty much fucking sucks you know I mean you know no one should have to go through this kind of be out every single time you know something goes up and it goes down you know I mean no like you know like I mentioned time and time before you know I'm so of a big Sony fan of as you mentioned I tend to pimp out you know this they have a dollar on your show fucking PSN is in your fucking Twitter name like you are definitely a Sony fanboy and that's okay you know you're you you've been pretty good you're not you're not like you've been fair you give Sony a bad time when they deserve it and it's kind of sad that Sony would be um no pissing off a loyal fan like you yeah yeah in fact there's thanks for our question why I even bother with Sony you know you know there's times where I think you know what screw it go call xbox xbox live and give Sony the finger you know but hopefully everything in the long run will work out I haven't set my system in just yet cuz I'm a few bucks short cover the repairs I should have all the money in place on the 16th you know once I get the money out to my card I'll send send my sister man and basically from there we'll play for me or see everything if everything works out so well good fucking luck to you spazz nator any other thing else you want to get out with the last few seconds you have tonight I know I think I got everything thanks all right well thank you very much straight yeah great fucking show thank you really fucking appreciate it have a great fucking night my man spazz nator poor guy having the Sony troubles and well at least they're offer offering to re-authenticate another system but it's just such a big pain in the ass why can't things just work why can't electronics just work you buy them and you fucking expect them to fucking work back we have any last minute stories to fucking get out there oh wait I got another call hold on one minute dark soccer I'll let you jump in right after this call you're on the Orange Lounge Radio fuck show who's this I was like a soccer who watching the Oscars and doing this at the same time fuck the Oscars bunch of sucking each other's dicks with these awards we all know it's gonna win doesn't fucking matter they bumped it up to ten movies it's a two-movie race anyway all right what's on your mind tonight I guess the the word fuck could probably apply to someone probably some entity deserves a case-to-point Activision ha ha yes our bad that happened recently what's your take on the whole fucking thing huh what's your take on the whole fucking thing um I think I knew it was it was on its way I think I knew was gonna happen it was a matter of when I mean the writing was on the wall when infinity Ward was you know actually nixed the dedicated servers modern warfare 2 you knew that is something that they probably didn't want to do but they had someone's hand probably forced them so it's kind of in other words the way I see it is that I don't know I guess Activision is trying to bring forth the you know the great video game crash that almost happened but never did are you talking about the one that happened in the 80s because that really didn't happen it just you know the way you see it is that you had you have a company that's um that's literally saturating the market basically trying to bleed everything you know try to get all their franchises dry and just like minimizing minimizing the amount of the amount of properties that I sustain them in other words if if it only comes down to Tony Hawk Hall of Duty Guitar Hero bringing bringing their only bird and butter that's kind of dangerous I don't know if it's gonna cause another fucking video game crash though I mean there's so many other reasons I mean you you get to the point where we're guitar heroes you know it's pretty much pan no matter what what new release comes out because they already know it's gonna be the same thing same dribble it's not gonna be worth the effort I mean the last to prove that point and when Tony Hawk you know Tony Hawk ride pretty much bombed for all intents and purposes it goes to show that they're they're not innovating we're just we're just releasing the same thing and trying to nickel and dime people no innovation more renovation I think they try to innovate it's just it sucked it's just the fact that they're not trying anything original like EA based EA learning they're there they learn their lesson already that's why so you see mirrors edge dead space Mass Effect because they're actually realizing that you can't you can't you can't milk the same same cow over and over and expect the the same result it just came down to where they they basically had their control system in place and it worked okay for Tony Hawk and then skate came out and had a slightly better control system that's where EA basically knew how to innovate they found they found a way to create a skateboarding game that was outside of the of the status quo outside of what what Tony Hawk is offered so you see right there when you when you feel to innovate the only thing you have is whatever you you know whatever you're able to market and whatever you're able to litigate all right I got to jump in and call time on the call because we're on three minute limit tonight but thank you Zaku as always for your perspective all right great night later we do appreciate Zaku's perspective and a gold fucking star for Zaku I did not hear much bam bam bamming on the keyboard and I heard little little taps but no worse than when Jamie points the mic at her keyboard all right love you mean it all right Jamie you had a last-minute story for us tonight speaking of which while we wait for another call at eight seven seven game olr on our fuck show I did and it was oh geez sounds awfully loud I didn't it was when actually that our good friend Martin left posted today and I thought it was really neat so I'm going to share it um there is a there was a report that is about a guy named Roy Williams who played through ocarina of time blindfolded to write a guide on how to play the game only by using using sound clues so that a visually impaired player could beat the game and so him and three other guys took two years to write this but Jordan Verner who was living in Ontario beat the game isn't that nice yeah that's it's cool and you know I know we have some blind gamers listen to this show that you know often kind of talk about you know using the kind of the sound cues in the games and being able to kind of play the games that way and I think that's cool that people kind of go out of their way to write things with sound cues and so forth and these FAQs so that everybody can really enjoy video games in one way or another so I think it's a great story okay we got more calls coming in sorry we've been ignoring the lines for a little bit but let's go to another call hi you're on the orange ons radio fuck show who's this it's about fucking time guys well really fucking sorry what's your fucking name my fucking name is Ron mo from the New York OL army fucker all right three fucking minutes what's on your fucking mind tonight dude I want to know what the fuck is up with FF 13 what do you mean the black guy is sassy okay so we both listen this sassy was one of the the adjectives I thought of when I was playing the game too and I'm less in I'm sorry it's just that's he just comes out kind of sassy you know you have to admit I'm a Barrett was kind of a little bit fucking sassy too but it was freaking hardcore that yeah that was a badass saws is sassy in a different way like dude Rama he has a fucking chocobo living in his fucking afro I mean come on but there is you sense that there is like again I don't want to give story spoilers but you sense that there is a definitely deeper story to him he's not just completely transparent comic relief they never they never Jansen Jansen was kind of sassy and lost Odyssey well they never explained right away at least where I'm at why he's even with them right now yeah but flashbacks will tell you a little later yes so it's all lost style remember so but easy he's a little bit sassy I it's better than Rama you after he's actually I will say he is my favorite character in the game right now because everybody else is in my opinion kind of such a stereotype of the Final Fantasy 7 characters in a way yeah yeah like I really I like him I think he's really interesting in the chocobo in the afro is so fucking adorable like I see like RuPaul sassy or just no no he's not like cheeky he's not like bitch you better work he's just the calm is he cheeky a little bit he's a little bit cheeky cheeky he's a little bit cheeky so sorry when you say sassy I think of your sassy pants no that's a whole different kind I know but that makes me think though of like RuPaul I don't know why but RuPaul makes me think sassy and Tyra he does say and I had to laugh because of the lethal rep lethal weapon reference I'm getting too old for this he does he does that no one is gonna ever top Sid for the attitude sit your ass down in the chair and drink your goddamn tea but Rama yeah be happy because I think they actually have a black guy doing his voice well I will soon find out because I don't know if you guys realize cuz Otacon is in a few fucking months and guess who's going to have to cosplay this guy you are yes everyone's like you have to cosplay this guy and I'm like oh fuck Rama he's pretty awesome he is it's it goes far beyond the color of his skin he's just a good character and he has a fucking chocobo in his fucking afro Rama okay okay now one more thing before I get the fuck out of here does that make it does that make it a chocobo all right I like that all right hurry the fuck up Rama time's almost up can I borrow somebody's fucking Xbox 360 for the next few fucking weeks cuz we pre-ordered fucking FF 13 and the roommates gonna be playing it so you know what that means I'm going to need to get the jaws like to get him off it but if I try to get off he's going to kick my fucking ass well Loki might be able to let you fucking borrow one of the broken ones but in the meantime I think yeah you know the broken ones are gonna really help you better that what the fuck you better let put a call out to the New York City OL army and I know there's a lot of you any fucking extra Xboxes out there help a brother out that's what's up yo all right Rama got you go times up later dude later fucking great night Ron is gonna come hang out with me this summer and so hold on we're on another call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this one to the fuck show this is a mega fucking 777 hello amiga fucking 777 what the fuck is on your mind tonight motherfucking PlayStation 2 or the Dreamcast killer ah so you're one of these bitter folks that the PlayStation 2 killed the Dreamcast and therefore we should not be celebrating its birthday we should be celebrating this one step closer to the grave yeah it it killed it we know it killed it and well amiga what could the Dreamcast you think in retrospect what could the Dreamcast have done to save itself gotten someone who is more skilled in marketing I guess someone that could have said you know hey when it comes to porting or whatnot you know the PlayStation 2 kind of isn't so good on this so you know our port of this particular game is looking better or something like that you're in no way related to the legend of Zaku by any chance are you high knock it off you know I just got a quirky voice that's all right that's cool so do I I just gonna say though if you were high then you've got one of those really cool stoner voices no I seriously there are certain people who just have really cool stoner voices you know what I mean no I do I do do you there's amiga is it all about PlayStation 2 hatred like you won't even touch it or can you even come around and admit okay there are there are some pretty fucking cool games on the ps2 there are some nice games but a lot of the good games you know didn't really show up until like it was almost like halfway to was that its successor came around you know ps3 and so I guess the only really good good good thing that really I guess got me hooked was like was smugglers run which is a was a launch title that's pretty awesome and an ffx that was really it everything else yeah what no fan division I love fan vision really quickly we don't have a lot of fucking time left isn't you said you're a fan of Final Fantasy 10 what do you think Final Fantasy 13 you think you're gonna be on board with that

sims expansion but yeah the expansion is called since ambition and it was all like uh-huh in a kind of way but still it's like yeah new more things like that should soon well a quick roundup of some sort well since I don't play in any MMOs nowadays I play since 3 as my response of data digital crack the only ambition though that they don't have in there is the ambition to be a porn star or stripper so I'm really not interested in this expansion at all maybe my ambition is to host a crappy podcast on the internet or maybe they strive to be my wall slave you know the person that I trap inside my wall of death or drown in my pool what do you have like a sawhouse in there or what's the deal that's what I do in my sims games it's basically you know you you create a wall a room around

company that puts all this on and I'm like hey I really want to I really want to go to this play and my friends like why do you fucking love such a shitty show and I'm like cuz it's Abba shut up when 1877 game olr if there's any more phone calls tonight's meanwhile Loki do you have any other last-minute stories for us while we wait for the phone to ring I'm so disappointed that all my Oscar picks would have won and I would have probably won money God yeah this will this teach me they need to submit my Oscar picks when they actually do them stop being so fucking lazy I am NOT lazy I'm just forgetful seriously stop being so fucking yeah yeah actually yeah all of them except for I think there's two that I missed I am happy to say that best short film went to logo rama and that was fucking awesome as an awesome um what won the song did one of the princess and the Frog songs well no it wasn't gonna be as the one from crazy heart was the one that won the weary kind that was the one of those trying to win anyways whatever the only ones that were surprising to me that I didn't win would have been the hurt locker for both sound editing and sound mixing but the rest the rest that all the ones I had picked wait one did hurt locker beat avatar hurt locker won best picture Wow that's not really it was trending twins so and now I don't care anymore all right well all right we're on to the call hi you're on orange on this radio who's this sex link hey how the fuck are you a lot better than I have been during the beginning of week when I got 22 in my teeth pulled oh my gosh that's right I heard you had the big big dental surgery well you're painful shit but you're well you're talking now you sound pretty good so everything's better well well I'm talking good right now because I don't have the dentures and I don't keep them in 24-7 sighs well it's kind of hard at first I was drooling for a first couple days looking like a fucking idiot but you know hey you know you live you learn you do it very slowly so you know and it got me a lot of time to catch up on a few games and such so I had a friend that had to have that done kind of young like in the early 20s so it happens so all right well what's on your mind you're not excellent um nothing much you know it's great to hear that the DRM is finally cracked so this way during hurricane season I could sit down with my laptop and play Assassin's Creed 2 and not worry about being connected on to a fucking internet fee 24-7 so because you know it's a lot of times you know during those down times it's good to sit there with a laptop and play a couple games and get caught back up so you know and also the ps2 thing is I have my ps2 fat I got the one the originals sing right across from me still works perfectly after all these years with a bunch of my games still going through so I mean you know how they get ps2 nothing but love for that so I mean system that doesn't break or you know go down for two and a half days you know when there's certain leap year issues with other consoles so you know nice I like though that we kind of get the back-to-back calls about you know ps2 love versus ps2 hate it's it's it's kind of cool not not hate just you know well you know there's a shitload of games for ps2 right now I'm still going through I mean I I came and started sitting here and tell you how many games I got to go through for the ps2 I'm sitting right across I haven't even touched or I went halfway through and you know and and you know and I still have a lot of them and I'm planning on going through them before I even consider to get a ps3 or anything like that because you know that's gonna be more on my list so I mean you know between that my PSP and my PC games I'm pretty much set for probably about almost a year give or take it it does have one of the fucking largest libraries of video games just ever and it's not stopping you know if you listen to Japanese release days there is still fucking shit coming out for it now so it's yeah but unfortunately the American version though is slowing down though yeah it depends the type of games you're into they always be some fucking poker game coming out no actually like a poker game for most a year all right I'm fucking smoking crack sorry 2008 was the last poker game we had come out no the last few games we had come out on PlayStation 2 or coming out they have a how to train your I can they actually have a soccer Wars game that was coming out in PlayStation 2 getting the nice little collector's edition treatment to that in April there's gonna be the Lord of the Rings Aragon's quest you know Lord of the Rings for kids and yeah that's pretty much that's it unless you're talking about maybe a few EA games but even EA cutting them out now for sports stuff at least maybe Madden probably will have a ps2 version I got it I got to jump in here cuz x-links three minutes are up but quickly do you have any other quick final thoughts for us nope that's pretty much about it that's all I had to say so all right feel better soon buddy see you on well after a little bit thanks all right later all right I think that's gonna do it for the sky plane tonight we got a lot of listeners in tonight so thank you guys very much for the phone calls really appreciate it if you didn't get through sorry guys I'm really fucking sorry but you have to send us a fucking email mailbag at orange lounge radio.com I know Loki's been fucking waiting to do some last-minute fucking stories right yeah sure all right there's there's some interesting information apparently Batman Arkham Asylum is getting the game of the year edition which was supposed to be coming out over in the US and as far as I'm aware still is coming out over in the US unless they well they've already answered they're not but whatever anyways what's kind of neat about the game of the year edition though if you may already have you know the version of the game you will actually be able to play this game in stereoscopic 3d that's right it's gonna come with 3d glasses and apparently use a technology called a tri-oviz 3d that will allow you to view the game in 3d and doesn't rely on red and blue lenses meaning the colors are preserved and apparently will work with HD and standard definition sets which you know if that works now I think they should that sounds like a good idea it sounds cheap speaking of good ideas coming from Warner Brothers okay well I'm being sarcastic here they're in talks now to produce a space invaders movie yes the movie industry has run out of ideas well at least they could do whatever the fuck they wanted I mean it's like there's this big fucking plot to space invaders aliens are invading earth shoot them Wow yes the space invaders apparently the they're speculating that the film will be a big bucked a big-budget action blockbuster held by some prolific director Sony has filed us some patents for game demos apparently that will lose feature over time which I have to say is the worst idea ever can't just fucking redownload it well maybe you won't be able to maybe it's gonna be like those time trials you know on the windows and stuff like that and why should I have to fucking redownload say if I want to show a demo I play demo say for a game that you may not be getting the lot of press or whatever and I want to show my friends like for example wet wet I thought the demo was fucking awesome and I show my friends and they got excited about it if I have to play the game again and the features are removed that's gonna be pretty disappointing well it was cool the first time I played it well what you have to do is you have to make another PlayStation profile and have your friend sign in to play no apparently Ubisoft is looking to take on Tony Hawk which shouldn't be too difficult at this point and they're gonna put out Sean White skateboarding yes Sean White apparently skateboards as well and unfortunately though in the screenshot they have of Sean White snowboarding looks like a Geico caveman so I don't know what's going on there because he certainly doesn't look like a Geico caveman normally and yes so they're gonna be releasing that game apparently and most likely on the Wii because that's where the last one came test drive unlimited is getting a sequel coming out apparently this fall and to playstation 3 Xbox 360 and PC and apparently the sequel will also have new elements including day night cycles weather effects and vehicle damage and hopefully the cops will figure out how to chase you down when you drive off the road apparently our chatters are not big fans of my Muppet voice which I guess is what that is let's see fucking Shahran and chat says so his next show the Muppet show or something that would be awesome no hi okie frog here and welcome to the OLR Muppet show doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo babies we had that happen a couple episodes ago ok Ripper is

Uhhhhh... Listen, frog! So yeah. That's... The O.L.R. Muppet Show is all about moi. Wow, I fucking made Loki shut the fuck up.

Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts tonight, because believe it or not, we're at the end of the fucking show. I hope you enjoyed your fucking selves tonight. Uh, it was a pretty fucking good time, and I'm sure we said the F word a lot. I don't... Maybe we'll get a count after the podcast goes out. I don't fucking know. We'll see. I didn't put a lot of fucking effort into it, unfortunately. That's alright. At the beginning of the show, it had a lot more fucks in the end. It was a... You get tired after a while. You do. You do. But it's... I would say you almost have to have more intelligence to be able to incorporate the word fuck into your fucking sentences for a long period of time. It takes some fucking creativity to do that. So... Alright. Um, thank you guys very fucking much for tuning in and supporting independent fucking radio. We really fucking appreciate your support, and if you fucking like what you fucking heard, please go give us a really fucking nice review on fucking iTunes. We really like five-star fucking reviews. Uh, it doesn't just have to fucking be on iTunes, though. Just tell a fucking friend, you know, in real life. Project Real Life, right? Tell some fucking friends what you heard on Orange Honch fucking radio, and, uh, tell friends to listen to shows. But you might want to not have them fucking start with this episode. Like, this should be, like, maybe the fourth episode you listen to. Don't have this be somebody's fucking first episode. But just tell your fucking friends. Word of mouth. That's all we fucking got, because we're an independent fucking podcast. Aw, yeah. Um, that's it. Let's go around and hear everybody's fucking final thought tonight. DarkSakura, what's your fucking final thought? Uh, fuck. Loki, your fucking final thought tonight? Uh, we'll have to see where this thing goes with this guy ripping me off. Um, I don't know.
