0	10000	Alright, welcome back everybody to Rob Roberts and Cals here on the Orange Moms Radio feed.
10000	11480	It's our E3 wrap up show.
11480	15960	The final day, yes sadly E3 2010 is all done.
15960	18720	And today we're not coming to you from a hotel room.
18720	22920	Actually right now we are in the parking lot of In-N-Out Burger where I've taken the one
22920	27520	and only Bobby Blackwolf to his first In-N-Out experience.
27520	30360	And Bobby, hyped.
30360	31360	Too much, not enough.
31360	33260	What did you think of In-N-Out?
33260	36920	It was a burger.
36920	42080	It's better than Wendy's and McDonald's and stuff but I'm, you know, being from the east
42080	44560	coast I'm partial to five guys myself.
44560	47800	I was expecting him to go, mmm that is a tasty burger.
47800	50200	He did a little bit, he did have a little bit of that I gotta say.
50200	54640	Alright, there's your Orange Lounge Foodio for those of you guys that have had your withdrawals
54640	55640	during the week.
55640	59880	We will be back of course Sunday to do the E3 wrap up with Dark Sakura and Loki.
59880	64840	That'll all be Sunday night at All Games Radio, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
64840	69300	But I really do urge you to tune in to the Bobby Blackwolf show who's right beforehand
69300	71780	at 5 Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern.
71780	74720	I don't know if that gets picked up on the mic but there was literally a plane flying
74720	75720	over us just now.
75720	79720	We're right by the airport to take Bobby over to the airport.
79720	82440	We'll give you a quick little preview though of what's coming up on Bobby's show because
82440	87200	we wanted to start the recording today before Bobby had to get on a plane and go and kind
87200	89640	of ask Bobby, you know, what did you think of your final day?
89640	94400	What kind of stuff did you see and what were your impressions on some of the games, Bobby?
94400	97400	Okay, so Rock Band 3.
97400	99360	That blew me away.
99360	100360	All the stuff that they added.
100360	101480	I didn't realize how much they added.
101480	106300	I know you guys covered it already so I'm not really going to add to it right now but
106300	110160	I will say one of the things I was able to, I played the keyboard and I played pro mode
110160	114820	on medium, which basically means that they add, you have two notes at a time.
114820	119080	So two note chords and everything and one thing that they don't tell a lot of people
119080	125360	and one thing that you don't realize is that they actually do have bumps on the keys to
125360	131640	denote where the color changes so you don't have to look at the keyboard when they shift
131640	134360	because you can actually feel where the colors are.
134360	138200	So I thought that was, that's like one little tiny thing, they don't really mention it,
138200	142280	they don't say it but that adds a lot.
142280	147920	So there was that and I also did an interview and it's going to be on E3coverage.com and
147920	153800	I actually stumped the guy about the MIDI port because the Guitar Hero drum set has
153800	161320	a MIDI input, kind of like what they're saying but it's not going to work for the pro mode.
161320	163880	You could use it for the basic but you're not going to be able to use it in the pro
163880	165600	modes of anything.
165600	171720	So that was interesting and they are considering, it's right on the line of the Rock Band Stagekit
171720	175080	for all five of us that have it, having Rock Band Stagekit access.
175080	178360	So there you go, Rock Band 3, I was very impressed with it.
178360	180520	Portal 2 is hilarious.
180520	189240	I got to sit in on the 15 minute demo of that and they have kept the humor, they are talking
189240	194080	to Jonathan Coulton, he admitted that to me, they are talking to him, asking him who he
194080	200240	wants to work with to do it so he is definitely going to be a part of it for the music side.
200240	206160	But they've kept the humor and the gameplay elements they've added with the liquids where
206160	212120	you can either jump or slide really fast and some of the other objects that they've introduced
212120	217600	really look like it's going to be a great title, it's going to be a stand alone title
217600	220240	and so I'm really looking forward to that.
220240	227160	One thing non-gaming that I saw today that probably won't interest the OLR audience as
227160	233300	much but it's more of a glimpse of what they can do in the future is I actually got a behind
233300	237720	the scenes demo of Kinect with the dashboard.
237720	243740	So showing the video chat and stuff where the Kinect camera seamlessly will zoom in
243740	245960	and out based on who's in the frame.
245960	249300	So like if you're sitting on the couch alone it will be zoomed in on you, if somebody sits
249300	253360	next to you on the couch it will automatically zoom out and put them in the picture, take
253360	256700	the two of you into the picture and stuff like that, if that's the kind of thing you'd
256700	258160	like to use.
258160	266820	But really, ESPN integration, it's not just watching ESPN3, which ESPN3 is their online
266820	268720	internet because ESPN doesn't...
268720	269900	The Ocho!
269900	271480	It's like the Ocho.
271480	276760	Basically it's all the stuff that they have regionally that err on like regional stuff
276760	279480	but not good enough for the national.
279480	284440	So you can watch anything online like college football, like if it's an out-of-market team
284440	289480	for you or if it's like a very small school or something, they probably still have it
289480	291080	on ESPN3.
291080	297680	And you don't just watch it, they actually ask you who you're rooting for and it actually
297680	298680	keeps track...
298680	299680	And here comes another plane.
299680	300680	The plane!
300680	301680	The plane!
301680	302680	The plane!
302680	303680	The plane!
303680	304680	So it actually keeps track.
304680	307860	They showed us USC versus Ohio State, you're gonna watch that college football game.
307860	311040	The first thing they ask you is, who are you rooting for?
311040	316040	And then it tells you how many people, percentages of people watching that on Xbox Live are rooting
316040	321160	for that team and then it'll do trivia questions if you want that feature on and you're competing
321160	324600	against the other fans while you're watching the game.
324600	329960	And just stuff like that, if they integrated that into ESPN, maybe other things, they would
329960	331880	be able to integrate that same thing.
331880	335400	Do you think maybe for like, you know, women and the gays, as they say, we could get the
335400	339000	Oscars in the same type of situation?
339000	341760	Although I'm so over the Oscars, personally.
341760	346200	I think that would be awesome where they would, you know, have people guess who might win
346200	347760	and stuff and who would get the award.
347760	348760	Who wore it best!
348760	349760	Who wore...
349760	350760	Yeah, and things like that.
350760	356240	So, you know, there's very good opportunity there for that and I was very impressed with
356240	361600	that and I got to use a little bit on the dashboard and stuff and it's gonna...
361600	364580	You still have to take very slow, deliberate movements.
364580	367160	You're not at the Minority Report level yet.
367160	370520	You can't just flick around or something because you'll wind up hitting something you don't
370520	371560	want to hit.
371560	375440	They were taking very deliberate movements to do it.
375440	376440	But I'm very...
376440	377440	I'm excited.
377440	381160	I'm one of the few people excited for Kinect for all, you know, for just the dashboard.
381160	384860	Can I actually go back a little bit and talk about the video chat real quick?
384860	387640	Because you know, obviously the...
387640	391320	Not the iToy, the Xbox Vision that we had before, you know, kind of had the video chat.
391320	394840	And you know, I realize this is way upgraded, you know, better quality, it can zoom in and
394840	395840	out and all this stuff.
395840	399120	But you know, one thing I found about the video chat is that I rarely used it because
399120	403240	it's kind of, you know, it's not like a cell phone where a cell phone is always on you
403240	405800	and you pick it up, hit a button, you're good to go.
405800	410000	You know, I would think with a video chat, you both have to be on the 360 and then you
410000	412560	have to, you know, kind of want to Kinect and so forth.
412560	413560	You know, I don't know.
413560	414560	I see...
414560	418440	It's like I get iPhone video chat, you know, if they ever get it on 3G.
418440	424400	But you know, I kind of sit here going, okay, that sounds cool, but am I ever really going
424400	429080	to use Kinect video chat except the one time to say I did?
429080	430680	You might not.
430680	431680	Families might.
431680	434520	Now realize it's not just 360 to 360.
434520	437840	It's going to be with Windows Live Messenger, not at...
437840	440720	And I believe they even said right at launch.
440720	444800	So you'll be able to talk to somebody if they have Windows Live Messenger on their computer
444800	448800	and a webcam, they will be able... you will be able to talk to them.
448800	451920	Okay, now that's a big thing I wasn't considering before.
451920	455900	I could see that now then maybe like, you know, college kids trying to talk to parents
455900	458800	or grandmas that are, you know, getting internet enabled in this day and age.
458800	459800	That makes a lot more sense.
459800	465920	And they also have Bing integrated with it where you could actually select...
465920	466920	We're going to wait for the plane.
466920	467920	The plane!
467920	468920	The plane!
468920	469920	There we go.
469920	470920	There goes the plane.
470920	475440	So you can actually select like top videos of like, you know, entertainment stuff and
475440	477160	you can both watch it at the same time.
477160	479200	They call them conversation starters.
479200	483200	So if you don't know what to talk about, somebody can select this video and it pops up in the
483200	488000	center and so you're on each side and you can talk about that video.
488000	493000	I can see it now us doing an entire episode of Orange Lounge Radio just of the Bing topic
493000	494000	selections.
494000	496680	Oh my god, what an amazing podcast that would be.
496680	499000	Just the Bing video chat podcast.
499000	501280	Come on you guys, you know there's somebody...
501280	502440	Patent pending.
502440	503440	It's mine.
503440	504440	Don't take it.
504440	506000	I will sue you.
506000	507000	We could do it together.
507000	508000	Hey, there you go.
508000	510520	I could do it at my place, you could do it at yours.
510520	511520	We'll record...
511520	512520	I've got the capture equipment.
512520	513520	Awesome.
513520	515440	And we could make it a video podcast.
515440	517760	There we go.
517760	522840	One other game I played which was actually a music based game, Power Gig.
522840	524920	I actually played this.
524920	529240	Now this is the game and somebody even asked me about it I think on my Sunday night show
529240	530240	last week.
530240	531480	They'd be like, what do you think of Power Gig?
531480	534560	I'm like, well if it teaches you how to play guitar, it'll be great.
534560	536760	This one doesn't.
536760	541440	It uses a real guitar, it looks like a real guitar, feels like a real guitar, but it's
541440	545520	really still the same as Rock Band.
545520	550320	And they actually, I didn't realize they had a drum peripheral.
550320	552300	The drum peripheral is air drums.
552300	555920	It's like, and since this is your crowd I can say this and they'll get it, it's like
555920	557680	Power Power Paradise.
557680	565480	So you have drumsticks with sensors in them that break the plane of the pads, of the sensors
565480	569500	shooting, or the lasers shooting up or whatever.
569500	575220	And basically there's four floor sensors that I guess are sending lasers upwards and the
575220	582960	drumstick is sensing them and that's how it does, that's how it determines which one you're
582960	583960	hitting.
583960	588240	You have a bass drum pedal that sits on to the right and then you have a button, you
588240	594440	have a pedal for your left foot that activates what they're using for star power.
594440	598560	But basically you have to hold the sticks a very specific way, which is not the way
598560	600380	I normally hold sticks.
600380	604080	You have to have your thumb up because they have a little thumb groove in the drumstick
604080	605880	and it has to be up and I don't play that way.
605880	612320	I play, for any music geeks out there, I play matched grip, like you would in marching band.
612320	613320	That's how I play drum sets.
613320	616920	I don't really do the thumb up grip, which is called French grip.
616920	619160	See I'm a nerd, band nerd.
619160	622400	But a lot of drum set players do, so that's why they do it that way.
622400	625680	But you have to do it that way.
625680	628220	Because if the sensor's not going down it's not going to register.
628220	632600	And I was having a problem getting one of the pads, the hi-hat pad to register at all.
632600	635120	It wasn't registering most of the time, so it was not a very fun experience.
635120	639440	But they said it was still beta hardware and it's not the final version.
639440	643280	Can I just say though, and kind of go back a little bit again, since you invoked the
643280	647960	name Para Para, something that kind of occurred to me today on the floor, maybe last night
647960	652920	after we taped, I don't know, but I realize I'm kind of, this E3 is really making me eat
652920	657760	a fat slice of humble pie because for years, literally years on this program, I've kind
657760	662420	of sat here and said, just give up, Para Para Paradise is never coming out in the US, so
662420	666440	you're not going to get it, it's not happening, people aren't going to get it here, so shut
666440	668960	up already, it's not going to come out here.
668960	674320	Enjoy its cultness and the fact that it's a very niche thing, embrace it, have fun with
674320	675320	it.
675320	677320	Boy did I get proved wrong.
677320	683760	It's the most interesting thing to happen, but I swear you guys, Dance Masters is, it's
683760	684760	Para Para Paradise.
684760	687600	I mean, if you do the Night of Fire thing, it's the same thing.
687600	689840	They found a way to kind of get away with it here.
689840	695480	Now granted, it's not exactly that, but that's as close, now I will say this, and I will
695480	699960	know I'm right, I will know I'm right, take it or leave it because this is the closest
699960	703960	you're ever going to get for those that are Para Para Paradise fans, which I know we have
703960	710400	some of those in the show, as years old as that is, the camera thing will be pretty cool
710400	711400	I think.
711400	716120	The game itself looks neat, but very interesting head to head that's going to happen with the
716120	720080	Harmonix game too, anyway, I don't mean to go back to old topics, but anything else you
720080	721080	want to talk about?
721080	722080	Bobby?
722080	729880	I'm trying to think, I did get to play Marvel Vs. Capcom 3, and for those that, I'm just
729880	732960	going to, I'm not really going to talk that much about the game, because I only played
732960	737480	it really once or twice, and it was button mashing and I lost, so I lost to Justin, the
737480	740680	editor, the other guy that does E3 coverage, who was not happy.
740680	743720	I beat him in dancing though, so I'm a better dancer.
743720	749920	But I will say that in the interview with E3coverage.com that I did, I did invoke Curly
749920	754520	Mustaches and Pringles and the Knicks.
754520	760160	So if you're a fan, I invoke all of those in that interview.
760160	768320	But I played, let's see, I don't even, I played Wii Party, because it was a short line, and
768320	772320	played the board game, which is kind of like Mario Party without the coins.
772320	774040	Played that for a little bit.
774040	777800	And it was kind of interesting, basically the mini games are to determine the roll order.
777800	779960	So that's just one of the many things in Wii Party.
779960	784280	It could be, I'm going to rent it at least.
784280	787880	And let's see, now I'm just stalling, because I'm trying to think if there was anything
787880	789840	else that I saw.
789840	793400	I don't think so, I'm in a Portal 2, hilarious.
793400	797040	On Live, I didn't realize that On Live is live now.
797040	800560	Like it went live probably about an hour ago, 6 PM Pacific is when they said it's going
800560	802120	live for everybody.
802120	806040	And I think if you're a founding member, you get one year free of On Live for the PC.
806040	807840	And it worked on the show floor.
807840	812040	They claimed that the server was up in Silicon Valley.
812040	816640	I don't know if I believe them, but if it's free for a year, I might as well, I might
816640	820040	check it out and see it on my own home connection.
820040	824620	This is going to be huge for MacGamers, which I know is kind of an oxymoron, but no, I'm
824620	825840	just kidding guys.
825840	829720	The MacGamers, I mean, getting to kind of do all this streaming, this is going to open
829720	831640	up a huge door, I think.
831640	834940	I would think that's where On Live is going to be most successful, but just watching it
834940	839600	on the floor, I didn't get the extensive demo you did, but I was like, is this for real?
839600	843200	Because it does look pretty smooth and pretty nice.
843200	846920	It's kind of one of those things that, you know on the show floor, everybody's putting
846920	849080	on their nicest front.
849080	853520	So I kind of wouldn't mind trying it on my home computer and see if it runs as well.
853520	857640	Bobby, I know we're going to wrap up, get you to your flight and all that stuff.
857640	860920	And if people want to hear more, they can tune into your Sunday night show or the one
860920	865480	I always forget to plug because we're not on right after it, but it's also a great show.
865480	870400	The effing show, the fnglive.net, which is a video show that you guys do.
870400	874080	You're actually doing one Friday night, which really, by the time most people hear this,
874080	877320	knowing what time I'm getting home tonight, it'll probably be tonight by the time most
877320	878920	people hear this.
878920	883320	So tune into that as well at, I believe, 5 Pacific, 8 Eastern once again.
883320	884820	So check that out.
884820	886760	One last question for Bobby though.
886760	891480	One of the thing that surprised you most about, and you've been to a lot of E3s, you've been
891480	893960	to about three times as many of them as I have.
893960	897960	Thing that surprised you most about E3 2010, Bobby?
897960	906280	Oh God, you're putting me on the spot here.
906280	911160	It's kind of hard to say because I didn't see all that much because of the appointments
911160	912160	and stuff.
912160	915320	And you know, with Microsoft, it was all interviews.
915320	919080	Like I never touched a game in the Microsoft booth and stuff.
919080	923720	Maybe it was what surprised me had nothing to do with anything on the show floor, although
923720	926840	the game that shocked me was Driver San Francisco.
926840	929620	I didn't realize that would be that good.
929620	933840	But that could also be a good demo just like a split second.
933840	942120	But it's more that I need to find a way to balance appointments and then having free
942120	943720	time to go roam.
943720	948320	I literally only had about two and a half hours the entire week that didn't have appointments
948320	950160	that I could actually roam the show floor.
950160	951160	Fourth day.
951160	952160	Yes.
952160	953160	I could use a fourth day.
953160	957800	I know everybody that works E3 is like, oh God, no, I don't want a fourth day.
957800	958800	I don't.
958800	959800	Oh my God.
959800	962560	But everybody could fill up a fourth day of appointments too.
962560	966240	So it's, you know, it seems it's too short.
966240	971680	But when I wasn't media and I was just showing up as, you know, exhibits only attendee as
971680	975680	a developer, I was usually bored by the middle of day two.
975680	981440	And I, you know, finish up, you know, Rock Band was my last thing that I saw.
981440	983760	You know, and I'm like, I could go another day.
983760	984760	You know, I'm not done yet.
984760	985760	I haven't.
985760	987760	I mean, I'm sure there's going to be something I'm going to miss and I'm going to kick myself
987760	988760	for missing it.
988760	994280	Like, you know, Civ V. But yeah, I'm, I need more time.
994280	996920	I think that was the surprise is that I need more time.
996920	997920	All right.
997920	998920	Good answer.
998920	999920	I was totally putting you on the spot.
999920	1001180	That was a good answer.
1001180	1002240	So thank you so much, Bobby.
1002240	1004560	And we'll talk as always on Sunday night.
1004560	1007960	Now, of course, Shane and I are still going to talk some games too, but we're going to
1007960	1009240	go drop Bobby off at the airport.
1009240	1014360	So we'll just do a little break here in the podcast-a-roo and we'll be back sometime after
1014360	1015780	the grapevine on i5.
1015780	1017120	So stay tuned.
1017120	1018120	Okay.
1018120	1022720	So we're back for the second half, although I'm kind of a terrible liar and it's almost
1022720	1025520	24 hours after we did that first half.
1025520	1029840	But we decided doing a podcast while trying to drive probably wasn't the best of ideas,
1029840	1032000	as boring as i5 is.
1032000	1035600	So yeah, we took the safe route and came home and then of course we were really tired and
1035600	1039280	that's stuff we want to do today, but we still wanted to at least wrap up some of the stuff
1039280	1045360	we saw on E3 day three while it's still fresh in our minds, although I find that I'm on
1045360	1046360	like game overload.
1046360	1047360	I played so much.
1047360	1050320	And I've been playing games since I got home because Shane's like, you got to play Alan
1050320	1051320	Wake.
1051320	1054320	And I have been, and it's been scary and all that, but I'll talk more about that on Sunday
1054320	1055320	show.
1055320	1060160	But anyway, um, while Shane is still here in California, we want to, um, at least kind
1060160	1064600	of go through some of the games we saw at E3 day three.
1064600	1068760	And then of course we'll resume, um, you know, with all the rest of the news on Sunday night
1068760	1069760	show.
1069760	1074440	So say hello to Shane, everybody who is back with us here on this, uh, Rob Robertson pals
1074440	1076880	Thursday kind of Friday edition.
1076880	1082200	It's actually been over 24 hours since we were supposed to do it because it's now almost
1082200	1087960	11 here and we stopped at like seven yesterday, but hi.
1087960	1091320	You know, through the magic of radio, people would have never known, but that's all right.
1091320	1093280	All right, Shane, let's get to the games.
1093280	1095000	Give us some games that you want to talk about.
1095000	1096000	All right.
1096000	1099800	I actually wrote these all down in a random order, so I'll go in a random order.
1099800	1101360	Um, no, I won't.
1101360	1102960	Castlevania Lords of Shadow.
1102960	1107480	It's the new Castlevania game coming out for the 360 and the PS3.
1107480	1112640	Um, pretty much a God of War style game.
1112640	1118240	The demo definitely made me want to play more of it, um, cause it had some interesting features
1118240	1121880	like there's a part where you're on mounted combat and when you get knocked off, because
1121880	1126680	I'm terrible at it, you have to fight through enemies before your little sparkle horse comes
1126680	1128920	back so you can start writing again.
1128920	1133720	Um, very graphically pretty, uh, kind of reminded me of like looking at a painting.
1133720	1137560	Um, so had some slow down issues, but it's okay, I liked it.
1137560	1141280	Yeah, I'm hoping some of the frame rate issues was just because it's still a beta and you
1141280	1145360	know, some of these things are really hard to judge from, um, early demo builds.
1145360	1149880	But um, I, the only thing that kind of got me about the game was that I think, you know,
1149880	1154600	a lot of people who weren't happy with the direction Castlevania took in the like PS1
1154600	1162240	and PS2 versions are, um, going to be, um, you know, really disappointed, I think by
1162240	1165680	what they're doing here because it didn't really feel like a Castlevania game to me.
1165680	1170800	In fact, if I remember right, I read somewhere that this game originally started as a totally
1170800	1175120	different game and then they kind of, I guess retconned the Castlevania thing into it.
1175120	1177440	Now it's not a, it was not a bad game by any means.
1177440	1182000	I actually thought it was really cool and pretty and, and, um, enjoyable, but I think
1182000	1187280	some people that were expecting the old style, you know, whipping Castlevania games are going
1187280	1190360	to be in for a surprise cause Shane's right, it plays a lot more like God of War, kind
1190360	1193720	of Bayonetta, it felt like a little bit to me too, um, with some of the cut scenes.
1193720	1197240	But again, very pretty and I still think, um, probably going to be worth your time checking
1197240	1198240	out when it comes out.
1198240	1202500	Um, now if you do want kind of that old school 2D experience, I got a little time with the
1202500	1207760	arcade, um, game, which is the, uh, what, Harmony of Despair, Castlevania game, which
1207760	1211640	I think we had talked about a little bit the day before, but I actually hands on played
1211640	1215560	it, um, on the last day of E3 and I enjoyed it.
1215560	1219920	Shane, I don't think, uh, felt so favorably about it, um, but I kind of liked the whole
1219920	1224160	Neo Geo effect of the zoom in and out, like if you ever played the fighting games on Neo
1224160	1227560	Geo, how it kind of like zooms way in and out and stuff on the action, you can kind
1227560	1231520	of control that in the Castlevania game, um, and it was very, um, you know, inspired by
1231520	1234940	Symphony of the Night, which I thought was cool, um, so it's basically a race from start
1234940	1239120	to finish, you have like 10 minutes to kind of get through the castle and I know the demo
1239120	1242540	castle I played was kind of hard cause it seemed like there really was only one path
1242540	1244840	through the castle, but I couldn't figure it out.
1244840	1248280	Um, unfortunately the demo on the floor didn't give a lot of exposition as to what all the
1248280	1252120	features were and the people at least where I was at, I played it at Microsoft's booth
1252120	1256360	and I don't think the people there were as on the up and up on, you know, what the game
1256360	1261960	was all about, so, unfortunately, um, I was a little bit kind of like lost I guess as
1261960	1266560	to all the features, but you know, I enjoyed what I played, um, and you know, I'm pretty
1266560	1271280	sure the arcade game will probably cost $10, maybe $15 and it'll probably be worth it,
1271280	1274940	I will probably pay it at least to check out the full version, if not at least the trial
1274940	1275940	for heaven's sake.
1275940	1282320	Uh, Fable 3 was another game I checked out at Microsoft's booth and Fable 3, um, again
1282320	1288520	the demo didn't really give you a lot, at least for me, of like what is really different
1288520	1293820	about the game from Fable 2, I noticed a lot of, you know, the gold trail was kind of back
1293820	1298040	from the other Fable games and the difference I saw was that you could dress up in a giant
1298040	1302760	chicken suit for one of the quests, um, but you know, they weren't running it on Kinect
1302760	1307200	or whatever, because right, Fable 3 is supposed to have some Kinect stuff, supposedly, but
1307200	1310680	they weren't really showing any of that on the floor, so I gotta be honest, I didn't
1310680	1313800	see a whole lot that was really different from Fable 2 and most of the people I talked
1313800	1318640	to, same thing, but, I mean, that's not really a bad thing, Fable 2 was a great game, it
1318640	1322120	was one of the better games that came out that year, it came out, so, more of the same
1322120	1326440	in this case, not necessarily a bad thing, um, and I'm sure there's some other stuff
1326440	1330680	I, like, you know, it seemed to be like there was a couple more interactions and things
1330680	1334840	you could choose from, so, I mean, that part of it's cool, so, that was pretty much my
1334840	1338960	impressions of Fable 3, I'll check that out when it comes out too.
1338960	1344240	So while Rob was playing Fable 3, I was just around the corner, uh, playing Crackdown 2,
1344240	1349200	and seriously, it was just Crackdown, that's all it was, and it was a 30 minute demo, which,
1349200	1353200	um, I actually didn't spend the whole 30 minutes playing, but I definitely could have, um,
1353200	1358820	easily, it was still fun, it was hilarious, um, and there were agility orbs, and that's
1358820	1364880	all you need in a Crackdown game, um, I didn't play a whole lot of the first game, um, so
1364880	1369420	this might be a new feature, but you can capture points, and then call helicopters down to
1369420	1373960	give you more weapons, and the more proficient you are with, like, guns, the better weapons
1373960	1381440	you get, so, uh, it actually really made me want to get one of those sleek new 360s, um,
1381440	1386200	so I was happy with it, uh, and I guess it comes out in a couple months, or next month.
1386200	1390000	What's wrong with the old 360s? Why can't you just get one of the old 360s? They aren't
1390000	1397160	the shiny new ones, um, plus, I would like to have a wireless adapter, um, and this one's
1397160	1403040	built in instead of paying an extra hundred dollars. Dollars? Dollars. So in other words,
1403040	1408360	what they really should have had the first time. Yes, and if it breaks, it can't red
1408360	1412040	ring technically, because there are no red lights inside, so if it breaks, it's gonna
1412040	1417920	be three green rings of death. Or hopefully they've just built it this time, so it doesn't
1417920	1422860	break, but that's another issue altogether, I'm digressing a little bit. So, what is next
1422860	1428400	on our list? Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Um, you know, the demo was limited, it only had about,
1428400	1431880	what, eight, ten characters, I don't remember, but that one, I mean, I guess that's still
1431880	1435680	a lot, ten characters was as many as they had in the, like, original Street Fighter,
1435680	1440200	right? No, the original Street Fighter was just eight. Anyway, um, it was cool, it was,
1440200	1444960	um, very stylistic, um, you know, as a lot of you guys have seen in the trailers. To
1444960	1449640	me it plays just like Marvel vs. Capcom 2. Keep in mind, I'm not on my up and up on fighting
1449640	1453560	games, so I'm not the best authority to talk about these types of games, but to me it played
1453560	1457320	a lot like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, but definitely had that more, like, kinda like Cell style
1457320	1462360	that you've seen in a lot of the commercials. Not as much of the 2D, 3D switching as I would
1462360	1466440	have thought based on the trailer and the fact that it kinda was supposed to be a little
1466440	1472400	more Street Fighter IV, I thought. Um, so graphically, you know, it's kinda like a souped
1472400	1476600	up arcade release, but I think it's gonna be, uh, pleasing for the fans. And some of
1476600	1481400	the supers do the 3D thing a little bit, at least it was in the demo, but again, early,
1481400	1486400	early, early build, and then, uh, had huge lines going for it all day at the Capcom booth.
1486400	1490880	Um, the trick to getting to play the game quickly was to go to Microsoft's booth or
1490880	1494880	even Sony's booth and play the game there, which is what we did.
1494880	1499280	I really liked it. Um, I'm not a huge fan of the Marvel vs. Capcom games, or I already
1499280	1504560	like Capcom vs. SNK, but, um, the one thing I noticed about it is because of the size
1504560	1511160	of the characters and the screen, um, amount that you have to play in, it felt like the
1511160	1515320	game was going a little too fast compared to the other ones. Um, sometimes it was kinda
1515320	1520800	hard to keep up with what was going on. And, um, as a button masher, cause I don't know
1520800	1526000	how to play Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and I picked, I think all new characters except for Iron
1526000	1534840	Man, um, Chris Redfield sucks. Like, utterly, utterly terrible character. Um, slow and just
1534840	1539880	awful. But Dante was really cool. I will definitely, when I play this game, will be playing as
1539880	1540880	Dante.
1540880	1547160	Awesome. Yeah, I pretty much played with standard characters. Felicia, Morgan, Ryu, all that
1547160	1551800	fun stuff. Alright, so I finally, um, made good on my promise to get some hands-on with
1551800	1556800	the PlayStation Move. Unfortunately, the line to get to all the really good games was really
1556800	1561200	long. Um, but some of the, like, littler games that didn't have quite the, you know, like
1561200	1564880	the bowling game and some other stuff, didn't have quite the long lines to get to them.
1564880	1569400	So the game I got to play was the Toy Story game, which, you know, it's not a bad game.
1569400	1572680	There's certainly an audience for it. It's definitely directed at a younger audience.
1572680	1576640	It plays a lot like the Midway Mania game that came out earlier on the Wii. Um, but
1576640	1579880	it's Toy Story 3, I should point out. It's, I guess, a game for Toy Story 3. But it pretty
1579880	1584200	much plays just like Midway Mania, the ride, or the, um, other game that came out on the
1584200	1589120	Wii. Um, you know, it's more of a point the move at the screen. It doesn't even use the
1589120	1592280	second controller. It's just the one stick and you just kind of aim it at the screen
1592280	1596680	and shoot. Very logical. But, you know, I was able to at least kind of get my hands
1596680	1601280	on it. I like the way that controller kind of felt to hold. Um, it is a little weird
1601280	1605860	with the whole, like, lollipop look that it has. And it's kind of funny because, um, when
1605860	1610080	you shoot, uh, a certain square in the Toy Story game, it'll activate rapid fire. So
1610080	1613840	you just hold that on the button to shoot, you know, the balls everywhere at the targets.
1613840	1617320	But your little, uh, ball on the top of your controller starts spazzing out and turning
1617320	1621000	all these rainbow colors. It's all pretty. So, you know, kids will get a kick out of
1621000	1625040	it if you have one of those households where, you know, mom and dad really like to play
1625040	1629560	their more hardcore PlayStation games, but you want some stuff for the kids too. I think
1629560	1632880	that's going to fit in very nicely with the collection. Or if you're, you know, a Disney
1632880	1637840	nut or you really like Midway Mania. Um, it was, it was cute. Although I didn't, I gotta
1637840	1643480	be honest, I was talking to the demo guy about a bunch of like other things besides just
1643480	1648280	the game. Um, so I couldn't tell you like how extensive the game's going to be, but
1648280	1652640	you know what? It's, it's a Toy Story game. It's, you know what you're going to get.
1652640	1658520	I am, on the other hand, um, when I got to play the move, I went to a more, I don't know,
1658520	1664200	real game and I ended up playing Time Crisis, the new one. I don't remember the subtitle.
1664200	1669760	Oh well. Um, it was great. Uh, the move controller works really well for Time Crisis. Uh, it's
1669760	1674800	very, very quick in response time when you move it around. I was getting headshots left
1674800	1679680	and right. Um, I had no problems playing it. In fact, I kind of played, I guess you could
1679680	1683520	consider it twice because I played with two different people next to me. I just didn't
1683520	1689280	want to leave and I always totally outdid the, the other people. Um, but I did talk
1689280	1693840	to the rep that was there and he told me that the game is not only going to have the on-rails
1693840	1698640	shooter like we all know from Time Crisis, but it will also have one, um, part of the
1698640	1704200	game where you can just move around and shoot things too. So you're not stuck to those rails.
1704200	1710680	And also he informed me that the retail copy will come with a move enhanced version of
1710680	1716520	Time Crisis 4. So you kind of get three games in one. Um, which is great because, uh, Time
1716520	1721560	Crisis 4, if it's free, it's good. I mean, it's a terrible, terrible Time Crisis game,
1721560	1726620	but this new one is really fun. So I'm excited. Um, one of the cool things real quick about
1726620	1732120	it was that the button on the top of the controller acted like your foot pedal in the arcade.
1732120	1737520	So you would, uh, release it when you want to reload and keep your, um, shield up and
1737520	1741720	then you would hold it down and then press the trigger button on the underside of the
1741720	1746160	controller when you'd want to fire. Now, if you take Time Crisis off the rails, though,
1746160	1752920	is it still really Time Crisis? I don't know. I can't see me playing that, uh, off the rails,
1752920	1757140	um, section of the game that much because it did sound like they were two completely
1757140	1762120	separate, uh, parts of the game. Like you can just play the rails game or you can play
1762120	1767240	the, uh, free roaming one. I don't know how the free roaming one will work and it'll require
1767240	1774600	for sure at least the, what, the Sony nunchuck, whatever it's called, um, to move around because
1774600	1779920	I don't think you can really move around with just the move controller. The navigation controller,
1779920	1785360	if I'm not mistaken, is what they call it. I like to call it, um, the, the, I think it
1785360	1791680	was like balancing rock from, uh, um, uh, WarioWare, uh, smooth moves because those
1791680	1797400	little intro things are hilarious. Um, and here's the microphone back. Alright, so we
1797400	1801040	went over to Nintendo's booth for a little bit and, uh, caught up on some of the stuff
1801040	1805520	besides the 3DS. Although we did spend a heck of a lot of time with the 3DS again, uh, which
1805520	1807960	I'll let Shane start in a minute, but I do want to talk about the other games we got
1807960	1811440	our hands on real quick. Some of the stuff we've been kind of teasing on the Sunday show
1811440	1815720	a little bit, Wii Party, which I know, um, Loki was kind of making fun of because, oh
1815720	1819160	my gosh, another mini game collection on the Wii. Who would have thought? But, uh, this
1819160	1822840	appears to be probably one of the bigger Wii titles they're going to push this holiday,
1822840	1827280	at least for the family unit. And it did seem like there were tons of mini games, but not
1827280	1831640	necessarily like the same stuff you would see in other games. It seemed like you would
1831640	1836480	have these larger games that consisted of a subset of mini games. I mean, kind of like
1836480	1840720	Mario Party, I guess, if you think about it. Although a lot faster and, um, a little less
1840720	1843600	cutthroat as I think Bobby might have said in the first half of the show, but I can't
1843600	1846560	remember because it's been over 24 hours. But the game Shane and I played was funny
1846560	1850840	because it was like a boat balancing game. I would like to point out real quick about
1850840	1859120	the cutthroatedness of this game. We argued. Because he did not put his Mii on the right
1859120	1864640	spot and then tried to blame me. And it wasn't my fault in the least. Well, it's not my fault
1864640	1868600	you're terrible at Wii Party and, like, you don't take direction. Well, um, but anyway,
1868600	1872520	that's, we were playing this thing where, like, there was a boat and you didn't want
1872520	1877880	to tip the boat over. But you had to play little mini games to get the people that you
1877880	1881800	would put on the boat. And if you passed the mini game, they would be the same weight.
1881800	1885480	But if you didn't pass the mini game, they would be, like, fat and skinny. And that's
1885480	1889620	bad. You don't want that. Um, but it's really funny when the boat tips over and everybody
1889620	1894040	falls in. That was my favorite part. So it was almost, like, worth it to lose miserably.
1894040	1897440	So that was Wii Party. I'm gonna be honest. I don't know if this is one I would necessarily
1897440	1902560	buy because I don't have a lot of parties at my one bedroom apartment. But, you know,
1902560	1907120	I think for the people, if you are getting a lot of use out of Wii Sports and Wii Sports
1907120	1911560	Resort and the other, you know, major Nintendo releases for party games, this is kind of
1911560	1917920	a next logical step that I'm sure will end up in a lot of households. Um, I liked Wii
1917920	1923900	Party a whole lot. My only thing about it is if they try to charge $50 for it and not
1923900	1930520	throw in, like, an extra controller or something, it's not worth it. Um, it was really fun,
1930520	1937800	but, like, $25 fun. Nothing higher than that. Um, but after we moved on from, uh, Wii Party,
1937800	1942960	we went to the Mario Sports Mix game, which was, interestingly enough, on the title screen,
1942960	1949520	showed that it was, in part, developed by Square Enix. So, what the crap. Um, it had
1949520	1954440	volleyball and basketball on it, and we played volleyball, and Rob was terrible. But I was
1954440	1958240	really good, because I got us some points, and I was very good at blocking the shots
1958240	1963760	from coming over. It was fun. The volleyball was a blast. Um, I kind of wish we had demoed
1963760	1968960	the basketball, too, but the volleyball had really simple controls, and, um, it was a
1968960	1973900	good time. Um, it's unfortunate that Shane would lie like that and say that I'm so terrible
1973900	1978720	when I was the only one running around grabbing all the power-ups, but that's okay. Um, here's
1978720	1982040	the thing, though. I gotta be honest. The game was almost a little too simple for me.
1982040	1987040	This is really a kid's game. Um, and you know, it's fine for that audience, but, you know,
1987040	1991440	I think for the rest of us, I think a lot of people are just gonna see it as, like,
1991440	1995680	woo, more of the Wii Sports type of stuff. You know, again, if you have that mixed household
1995680	2000160	that has the kids and the teenagers, maybe even, that would get a kick out of this, it
2000160	2003880	would probably be worth it. Before the quote-quote hardcore gamer, which is probably most of
2003880	2008800	the folks that listen to this show, I couldn't really take Mario Sports Mix seriously. And,
2008800	2012920	um, you know, they try to incorporate some of the Mario elements into it, like the red
2012920	2020560	shells, you know, and cute little things like that, but I couldn't take it seriously. Which
2020560	2025960	I think is unfortunate, because I think it'd be a good relaxing game. Um, again, not a
2025960	2030520	fifty dollar game, which they will charge for it, but a pretty good one just to kinda
2030520	2035240	hang out and do nothing. Well, if I wanna play a relaxing game, I'll just play Wii Relax,
2035240	2040680	which was totally absent from E3 this year. Who would've thought? It was like Nintendo
2040680	2047600	knew to keep, uh, Kami Dunaway and the Wii, uh, Vitality Sensor away from E3, so nobody
2047600	2054140	would get mad at them. Um, which is great. But moving on to the most, uh, important part
2054140	2060280	of the show, I think, um, we went back through the 3DS line, which was fantastic to actually
2060280	2065080	get to go back through and really spend some quality time with, uh, some of the games,
2065080	2073480	um, demos and videos. Uh, I will, uh, say that they had a, uh, DJ Hero game on there,
2073480	2077440	which I didn't even really realize. I know they had mentioned it before, but I thought
2077440	2081400	they weren't, I didn't know it was up there to play. I was so pumped when I saw it, I
2081400	2088100	hopped right over, and it is an amazing game. Um, it's all the bottom screen, uh, the touchscreen.
2088100	2093960	You have 3D tracks still, but you only have, um, the little note circles in the middle,
2093960	2099040	so you just tap the screen wherever you want for that. And then to slide, uh, your crossfader
2099040	2103320	to the left or right, you slide the stylus on the screen. And it was really good, and
2103320	2109840	the 3D effects made it kinda neat to see the, uh, the tracks, so to speak, come at you as
2109840	2115640	you're playing. Um, and you played the DJ Hero, didn't you? Nope, nope, he's shaking
2115640	2122040	his head, so I guess I won't hand the mic back over. Um, I also played the, uh, Professor
2122040	2128000	Layton game. It was like Mirror of Something working title, so whatever. Professor Layton
2128000	2134720	3DS, there we go. Um, it was cool. It was Professor Layton, but, uh, instead of the
2134720	2141480	typical static screen where you touch things to find clues, you have a, uh, 3D screen on
2141480	2146480	top and you can use this magnifying glass on the bottom screen. You move it around and
2146480	2151480	your magnifying glass will change into, like, an orange filled magnifying glass if you find
2151480	2158160	something to technically click on. Um, that was cool. Uh, the puzzle that you got while
2158160	2165240	playing was, um, you know, uh, just a standard Professor Layton puzzle. I had to put a robot
2165240	2172040	together, um, so it wasn't anything big and I didn't really use the 3D, but that was okay
2172040	2177980	because it was still really fun and Professor Layton. Um, I also played Pilotwings. Uh,
2177980	2184120	it was just a short demo. I flew a plane through some rings. Uh, it kind of felt like Wii Sports
2184120	2189480	Resort, uh, more so than Pilotwings, but, you know, that's what they've been making
2189480	2194220	recently. So, hey, here's Rob. Sorry, I ran out of room real quick. Can I, um, comment
2194220	2197120	real quick, though, on Professor Layton because I also checked this out. I don't play the
2197120	2201000	Professor Layton games, though. It was, let me explain, though. When you were up there
2201000	2206120	demoing the 3DS, it was just a lot, probably all those women you saw at the press conference
2206120	2210840	were now sitting up on the 3DS stage where you would go up there and they all had DS's
2210840	2215120	tied to them, but the only kind of, like, problem was there were no signs saying what
2215120	2219460	game was where. So you kind of would just walk up to women and see what game they had,
2219460	2223600	you know. Um, which, you know, it's hard to kind of walk away, too, once you kind of get
2223600	2228120	sucked into a game. Uh, so I checked out Professor Layton, even though I don't know the DS games
2228120	2232080	at all, like Shane does, but I will say the one thing I noticed was that the 3D effects
2232080	2237760	were probably the most sharp of almost anything that I demoed. Um, you know, in, in, you know,
2237760	2243040	my 3D can sometimes be really picky, uh, but I thought Layton had probably some of the
2243040	2248260	best 3D that I saw. Even though it wasn't, like, gimmicky 3D, like, pop-out things shooting
2248260	2253360	at you, um, I thought it was just kind of some of the sharpest 3D.
2253360	2258120	And I think the, um, art style of Professor Layton really is, um, a good match for the
2258120	2266120	way they did the 3D. It was almost like a pop-up book, so to speak. Um, so I was saying,
2266120	2271480	yeah, Pilotwings, it's just kind of Wii Sports Resort. It was fun. Um, then, uh, I played
2271480	2275460	Ridge Racer. Didn't really care for it. I think it's the first handheld Ridge Racer
2275460	2279640	I did not like. Um, but you played some of Ridge Racer, didn't you?
2279640	2284720	Yeah, I mean, the controls were kind of dopey-like and just, it was not realistic at all when
2284720	2288800	you would run into walls. I'm trying not to be too harsh, though, because, you know, early,
2288800	2293320	early, early, I think it's more of a concept than anything like the actual game. Again,
2293320	2298000	the 3D effects were pretty cool, though. Um, it took a minute to kind of get it right because,
2298000	2302160	you know, I think there's a lot going on that your eyes kind of have to catch with the 3D,
2302160	2305240	but once it kind of clicks, like, I think the 3D effect, obviously, you know, racing
2305240	2309680	game, um, was really good. But I was more impressed with the visuals and the Mario Kart
2309680	2313360	concept pre-rendered footage that they had running somewhere else. But at least this
2313360	2317520	one was playable. But, like, when you would run into walls, your car would just kind of
2317520	2324200	like turn 20 degrees to one side. It was so not smooth at all. But, again, I really, really
2324200	2328160	think it's unfair to, like, judge a whole game based off these very, very conceptual
2328160	2332080	demos. This just wasn't one that made me jump up and down like some of the other concept
2332080	2333720	demos did.
2333720	2337320	I would say we have to say maybe conceptual demos because we don't know when these games
2337320	2343480	are coming out and some of them actually felt pretty polished for demos.
2343480	2348440	I guess that's true. If this is the game, though, um, it's, uh, I would totally pass
2348440	2353560	on it until the Mario Kart game comes out as far as I'm concerned. Um, let's see, one
2353560	2357560	of the games I checked out was Kingdom Hearts, um, although it was not really a game. It
2357560	2362440	was just kind of a concept thing, uh, where you would watch pre-rendered video. Um, so
2362440	2365480	really all I can say about it was that it was kind of like watching the opening on the
2365480	2371400	PS2. I mean, it was, um, the 3D was, you know, there wasn't a lot going on, but it was, I
2371400	2376000	was more impressed that, wow, this is like PlayStation 2 style graphics on the DS. That
2376000	2381520	was, um, you know, not, not quite at that caliber, but almost definitely a step above
2381520	2383880	where it was at before. So that was pretty awesome.
2383880	2388000	Um, one of the other games I played that I think Shane didn't was Samurai Warriors, which
2388000	2392760	was like half video, half playable demo. Um, and that was, that was cool. I mean, the playable
2392760	2397080	demo was very simple. It was just kill, uh, 50 warriors really quick, but the 3D was,
2397080	2400920	um, they used a lot of it and, uh, you know, not just the depth and running around killing
2400920	2405040	the warriors, but then like, you know, little anime overlays would come up when you do special
2405040	2408880	moves and those kind of pop out. And I thought that was pretty cool.
2408880	2417240	Um, and a game I know I played that, uh, Rob didn't was Nintendogs plus cats. Um, unfortunately
2417240	2422140	they didn't have the cats, but they did have a couple breeds of dogs. I actually did switch
2422140	2427880	between breeds just to see if there's any real differences. It was Nintendogs. Um, probably
2427880	2432480	the coolest thing about it was when I threw the ball and the ball went, you know, 3D into
2432480	2438280	the back and then he came running back with it and, you know, it was 3D and Nintendogs.
2438280	2441680	It's going to be boring after a few days, but you know, the first couple of days you'll
2441680	2448640	really enjoy it. Um, I also saw a few videos and I'll just quickly hit on those. Uh, Paper
2448640	2455960	Mario, beautiful game. Um, it is like a pop-up book. It was really cool. Um, Metal Gear,
2455960	2460360	amazing. Uh, I hear a lot of people think it's one of the best videos on the floor.
2460360	2465080	I can agree. You could move the camera around. It looked like a PS2 game, but in 3D it was
2465080	2471240	really neat. Um, I saw Dead or Alive on videos just really briefly cause I was like, I don't
2471240	2476320	care about Dead or Alive, but graphically it looked pretty nice. Um, and then the worst
2476320	2482680	video goes to Resident Evil because for some reason I could not find the right angle to
2482680	2489520	look at it. I looked at it straight on like every other demo and sometimes it would be,
2489520	2495240	you know, in focus and sometimes it would be crazy. Couldn't understand why. Um, but
2495240	2501680	that was my, uh, entire 3D. Oh no, wait. I took pictures with the 3D camera. Um, they
2501680	2507080	had that off to the side. I had to hunt for it and those were really cool. Um, you can
2507080	2512720	actually adjust, uh, like, you know, with the slider how the 3D looks, but there was
2512720	2517840	also like an option to toggle how the actual 3D looks. Instead of just making a flat image,
2517840	2524800	you could kind of change, um, the perception, um, on the 3D image itself. I'm kind of pissed
2524800	2527960	I didn't see that because that was one of the few things I really, really wanted to
2527960	2532520	see. Um, let's see, out of those that you talked about, I also saw the Resident Evil
2532520	2538000	1 and I also had a difficult time really seeing the 3D in it, but graphically, wow, wowee
2538000	2542880	wow. I mean, I don't know if that was pre-rendered video, I'm assuming it was, but if not, wowee
2542880	2547360	wow. Um, otherwise, I think the only other game I can think of off the top of my head
2547360	2552000	was, uh, Sims 3, um, that I saw on the DS and, you know, the only real feature they
2552000	2555920	were showing off was again about picture taking. Um, you could actually take a picture of yourself
2555920	2559800	using the camera and it would like model your face on the character. I don't think though
2559800	2563520	that's a, I haven't played the DS one that's out there now, but I'm pretty sure it has
2563520	2568520	that same feature, at least for the DSi. Um, so, you know, whatevers.
2568520	2573200	Uh, until I heard that the line was four hours towards the end of the day, I did want to
2573200	2578240	go back because I somehow missed the Star Fox demo and I really, really wanted to play
2578240	2582880	that because I heard nothing but good things. Um, so I apologize to anybody that wants to
2582880	2586000	hear it. I really wanted to play it, but just missed it.
2586000	2590400	Ditto. I just, you know, just wanted to get my hands on as much stuff as possible. Even
2590400	2595200	if it was games I wasn't super familiar with, I just wanted to just see as much 3D as possible.
2595200	2599880	Um, some of the pre-rendered videos though they had were really impressive. Um, what
2599880	2604880	they kind of did to really help the line situation was that they actually had gals walking around
2604880	2609240	the line a little bit, kind of showing off the DSs they had. So you could actually see
2609240	2613160	the 3DS before you really got on the stage, but all they would show was just like some
2613160	2617400	pre-rendered concept videos. But man, there was one, and I know Shane feels differently
2617400	2621240	about this one, but there was one with like a champagne cork popping up and like all the
2621240	2626280	confetti and streamers would pop out of the bottle. And it was the one thing where I really
2626280	2632520	felt like the images were not going in a hall or whatever, like the depth is going back.
2632520	2638720	I felt like the images were really popping out, like it was really astounding.
2638720	2643720	My favorite thing from that video, and you're right, I did not like the champagne bottle
2643720	2649960	um, popping with the streamers. It just, not because of, I thought it was terrible looking,
2649960	2654660	it just kind of made me a little bit dizzy feeling because of the way my eyes were focusing
2654660	2660960	on it. But um, they had a pre-rendered picture that you can move around of Pikmin, and I
2660960	2667960	love Pikmin, and that made me really really really need a Pikmin game for this 3DS.
2690960	2695240	It felt like the other Final Fantasy games that are on the DS right now. I guess the
2695240	2700600	big thing is hats. You put on hats and it changes your jobs, and anybody can be like
2700600	2704600	any job, so I guess maybe it's got like a 5 thing going with it, but I really didn't
2704600	2710160	spend enough time with a floor demo to really comment any further. I think if you like the
2710160	2715160	Final Fantasy 3 and 4 on DS, this is probably right up your alley.
2715160	2719720	I played it a little bit too. Unfortunately the demo I picked up, somebody had just finished
2719720	2725840	playing, and they died. So one of my characters was dead and I had no magic to use, so it
2725840	2734840	was really boring to me. But, for me, the 3DS versions of the Final Fantasy games felt
2734840	2739720	too slow, and this one was no exception, so I was not really digging it.
2739720	2744800	You're just a hater. But I will say this, I thought it was really cute how in the demo
2744800	2749320	they definitely had programmed it as an E3 demo. It really reminded me of a few years
2749320	2754120	ago there was a Katamari Damacy game coming out that was specifically for E3 and the king
2754120	2758720	would talk about E3 and stuff. That was kind of similar to this little demo they had. The
2758720	2762520	little characters in the village talked about, you know, we worked really hard on this demo,
2762520	2767560	we hope you enjoy it. It was really funny. I like cute little things like that. It makes
2767560	2770960	the demo games feel that much more special.
2770960	2776040	That's like the ghost trick demo that we played. They had a lot of references to how it was
2776040	2781160	just a demo, that the retail version would be different, and that was fun. Oh my god,
2781160	2787160	the dog in that game is adorable. I know we've already talked about it, but it was great.
2787160	2793520	Now let's bring this podcast down a little bit. I went to play Final Fantasy XIV. The
2793520	2799120	good news is the character creation is fun. It's got some really nice options, especially
2799120	2803520	if you played XI, you know you were very limited in what you can do, but this one gives you
2803520	2810240	not a whole bunch more options, but far more than you ever had in Final Fantasy XI. I had
2810240	2817420	highlights in my hair that were blue. I could change to many different hairstyles, many
2817420	2825240	different eye colors, many different skin colors. They also had adjustable voices, adjustable
2825240	2832280	features like scars and stuff like that, and nose and chins and mouth options. It was crazy.
2832280	2838600	The bad news is the combat is awful. Absolutely terrible. They told us that the beta build
2838600	2842800	that we were playing was different from the current alpha that players are playing right
2842800	2849560	now. The combat is one of the most clunky combat schemes I've ever seen, and I played
2849560	2856120	Final Fantasy XI, so I know clunky combat. So what they had us do was get into a party
2856120	2860280	and start this thing called a guild leave, which was awesome. It's a quest where you
2860280	2869840	can select different styles of play, like solo, duo, party, something else, and all
2869840	2876920	your server, something like that, for difficulty, so you could get better rewards or maybe do
2876920	2885040	a quicker quest and still do the same quest. They had three of us join up as a group, and
2885040	2891140	we had to go kill crabs. So we found the crabs after some terrible walking with bad cameras,
2891140	2895680	but they said the cameras would be fixed, so hopefully that's true. Found the crabs!
2895680	2900040	The first thing you have to do before you initiate battle is unsheathe your weapon.
2900040	2905800	Not a big deal. Then you have to target your enemy by clicking on it. Kind of getting annoying.
2905800	2910640	Then you run up to the enemy, and you have this stamina bar that's not unlike the Final
2910640	2916080	Fantasy XIII gauge, where you could queue up actions, and once the bar is filled up,
2916080	2921820	it'll take those actions. So once you do that, and you make sure your enemy is targeted,
2921820	2927980	you will unleash attacks. The combat, though, is so fast that you just don't have time to
2927980	2937600	really think about what you're doing. There's no on-screen text besides in your little chat
2937600	2942040	log to tell you if you're too far away or if you can't perform that action. Constantly
2942040	2945800	I thought I had the enemy targeted, but I accidentally clicked on myself, so nothing
2945800	2949920	was happening. But I didn't really realize this, because there were not enough on-screen
2949920	2955640	commands to tell me I was doing something wrong. I really, really hope they fix that
2955640	2962760	because, I mean, I'll still get the game. I won't be able to help myself. But it's going
2962760	2967640	to make the game a little less fun for me if I can't even attack an enemy. Granted,
2967640	2971880	I was a class I never would have played to begin with, the gladiator class. I definitely
2971880	2975080	would have been the mage or the lancer had I known. I just had to sit at a different
2975080	2983440	chair. But I don't know. I don't have high hopes for the combat, especially since it's
2983440	2986760	just not that great.
2986760	2990200	Here's the thing. I think Shane is being a little harsh on the game. I will say this.
2990200	2994840	I observed, because Shane wouldn't let me play. But the game was beautiful. Oh my god,
2994840	3001480	it was so pretty to look at, especially for an MMO. I thought it was great. I think this
3001480	3007680	is a game that is very hard for Square to demo at an expo like E3. I think a game like
3007680	3012100	this takes a big learning curve, and I think that's part of the reason Shane had a lot
3012100	3017280	of problems is that I think he got thrown right into this thing and was being told,
3017280	3020280	okay, do this, now this, now this, now this. You know, I'm almost kind of like, you know
3020280	3023240	what, the dude should have just sat there and played it and we should have watched.
3023240	3027600	I mean, I think it was just too much for Shane to kind of like have to do it once. I think
3027600	3030720	when you play the actual game, you'll kind of learn how to do it piece by piece. Like
3030720	3034960	remember how the biggest complaint about 13, it takes forever to unfold? Well, you know,
3034960	3038960	a lot of it's teaching you a little piece of the game at a time. And I just think the
3038960	3044520	way they demoed it kind of bit him a little bit. I think when the actual game comes out,
3044520	3047680	it won't bug Shane as much. That's just personal logic.
3047680	3052600	Yeah, and I can kind of agree with that. I still would like to see a little bit more
3052600	3058780	of the interface changed. Like if I'm too far away from an enemy, I don't need a little
3058780	3062700	box in the corner telling me that. I need something on screen. Might be because I'm
3062700	3070980	used to WoW, but that effectively gets me to realize that I'm too far away. The other
3070980	3079420	thing that I would like to see changed and could probably have helped a lot is the pointer
3079420	3084560	on screen was not very smooth. Like you would move your mouse and then the pointer would
3084560	3090040	move very slowly, not responsive compared to what you're moving on the mouse. If they
3090040	3094540	can speed that up, get it kind of like to a 1 to 1 ratio, your movement speed, it'd
3094540	3098960	probably help a little bit more. But by the time I was able to like click on the button
3098960	3105040	to go use my TP, the fight was over and it kind of sucked.
3105040	3108560	Again though, I think that's a problem with the demo, not the game.
3108560	3111960	I've heard it's the same for the alpha, but it might still be alpha related.
3111960	3118720	Well, I will say this, as somebody who's sunk a couple years into Final Fantasy XI, conceptually
3118720	3123520	I really like a lot of the things they did with XIV. I just think I can really see where
3123520	3132480	they've tried to make an effort to have things more solo-able, like with these guild lives
3132480	3137720	with the different levels of difficulty. I thought that was really cool and I just loved
3137720	3142880	how the quest start was right there, the quest turn in was right there when you finished,
3142880	3147160	everything was very instant gratification. Those of you that have played XI know it's
3147160	3153000	a lot of walking and running around and slow moving game. It definitely feels like they've
3153000	3157920	kind of picked up the pace a little bit in XIV. Conceptually, I was really a fan of the
3157920	3160800	stuff they implemented that I saw.
3160800	3165520	Another cool thing, because I'm not all boo-hoo on this game, especially after today we watched
3165520	3169640	the trailer on Rob's TV and like I told him, I was like, well, this trailer just changed
3169640	3175280	my mind, I'm going to play again. It was just cut scenes. Another cool thing about the guild
3175280	3181720	leaves is that if you're someone that likes to grind in games and just not read anything,
3181720	3186360	any enemies you have to kill for guild leaves have little guild leave markers next to their
3186360	3191800	name so you know you can avoid everybody else and just focus on those same enemies. Though
3191800	3194880	that does bring me to another thing I forgot to mention is that when we were killing the
3194880	3199960	crabs, because that's what we had to do, one crab, before it died, started to run away
3199960	3205720	and those suckers moved fast and they could not catch up. Part of the way you regain health
3205720	3210060	is you sheath your weapon. Well, you've got to stop to sheath your weapon, the animation
3210060	3214640	forces you to. So he's still running away, I'm trying to sheath my weapon, so it stops
3214640	3220760	me, he's getting farther ahead, and I probably would not have known where to go unless the
3220760	3228760	representative had to tell me where to go because I lost sight of him. Something to
3228760	3232380	keep in mind though, didn't you want the crabs to run ahead? Because didn't they take you
3232380	3235960	to a room that had the other monsters in it that you needed to kill? It almost seemed
3235960	3242200	like that was part of it. It did seem like it was part of it but one thing, and I'm not
3242200	3246400	sure because I was one of the people that didn't read the leave at all because it wasn't
3246400	3251880	on my screen, until we actually got to that room where we had to kill water elementals
3251880	3258400	too, the water elementals did not appear as part of the quest as what I had to kill. It
3258400	3264920	wasn't until I got to that room where their name appeared below my crabs I've killed.
3264920	3269920	So I don't know if that triggered more to the quest or if it just didn't show up until
3269920	3276720	I got closer to those enemies. Hmm, interesting. Alright, well let's move on from Final Fantasy
3276720	3281320	XIV and talk about some of the other games we saw. I know Civilization V was another
3281320	3285160	game we had a little time to sit down and have a demo done for us, we didn't get to
3285160	3290840	play it, but it was a really gorgeous game. Of course they had it running on their best
3290840	3297960	system, but you can really see the level of detail. Fully animated leaders of the other
3297960	3301760	worlds for those that have played other Civilization games before. What I really like they've done
3301760	3306160	with it is that now they're all voice over too in their native languages. So Napoleon
3306160	3310120	actually speaks French at you, although of course there's English subtitles, and so on.
3310120	3318960	Right on down to Monzuma speaks old antiquated languages. Very cool stuff. The hexagonal
3318960	3324020	shift is kind of new. There's a new thing that they put in there, and I'm terrible I
3324020	3327640	forgot the name of it and I should have taped the thing yesterday so I can remember, but
3327640	3333360	they reminded me of like talent trees in Diablo or WoW, where as you put your points in these
3333360	3337480	certain trees it kind of has this effect on your civilization, which I thought was kind
3337480	3342680	of neat. So yeah Civ V I'll definitely be looking at, but you know I know you Civ fans,
3342680	3345920	you know, if you played enough Civ III and IV you're going to get this game no matter
3345920	3351880	what I tell you. So I think though they're really trying and it was again very pretty
3351880	3355240	to look at. Now Shane, you don't really care for the Civ series, but I made you sit through
3355240	3361160	the demo anyway. It's not that I don't care for the Civilization series, it's more that
3361160	3367660	I don't do strategy games. I don't have the patience, nor the I'm guessing brain power
3367660	3375480	to do them, but I'm glad I watched the Civ V demo because it actually looked really interesting.
3375480	3380580	It looked kind of like a SimCity style game and I know it's not, but there were so many
3380580	3385560	aspects that you can focus on in that game instead of just all out battling it looked
3385560	3390360	like that. It might be something I give a shot. It was funny and like I said with Dead
3390360	3394280	Rising I'm scared of zombies, but the game was funny so I'm probably going to play it.
3394280	3401040	Civ V I'm scared of strategy games, but it was funny so I'm probably going to try it.
3401040	3406800	Alright whatever makes it work, huh? Alright I guess the very last game there is to talk
3406800	3414380	about is Puzzle Quest 2. Yeah I know we saved the best for last. No I mean it was cute.
3414380	3419040	Although yeah the main battle is more of the same, but hey hold on. There seems to be a
3419040	3422200	lot more mini games. That's one of the first things I noticed. Like you know in the original
3422200	3427440	Puzzle Quest there were games that you would do to take over the cities and all that stuff.
3427440	3431280	It seems like they've built more of those types of games in Puzzle Quest 2 and that's
3431280	3434400	one of the biggest differences I noticed off the bat. And you can play those mini games
3434400	3440000	on demand which was cool too. I'm kind of dumb because I just remembered a really good
3440000	3444640	thing I've tested out on Puzzle Quest 2 was the campaign mode because I know it was there.
3444640	3449640	I just went to quick battle, but yeah it was more of the same. Graphically nothing really
3449640	3455320	changed. We played the DS version just so you know. We had people next to us playing
3455320	3463020	the 360 one, whatever. Quick battle was just pick a character, fight a goblin, win. Except
3463020	3468320	I lost the first one. Won the second one. But I forgot to try the campaign mode because
3468320	3474720	that's the thing that was supposed to be overhauled. So that sucks. Guess we'll have to wait until
3474720	3480280	the full release. Oh well. Alright so before we wrap up, Shane I'll ask you kind of the
3480280	3483120	same thing that I asked Bobby and put him on the spot with. What was the thing that
3483120	3491600	most surprised you about E3? This is actually easy. The 3DS. And we all knew it was coming.
3491600	3496040	Didn't know in what form. And you know I was one of the skeptical people. I knew I'd buy
3496040	3501800	it regardless because it's a Nintendo handheld. You can't go wrong. But I was surprised by
3501800	3509280	the I don't know how much it really changed some of those games to me. Like seeing DJ
3509280	3515080	Hero with the track coming at you was such an interesting idea compared to just seeing
3515080	3523120	it flat. Kind of scrolling down the screen. Seeing freaking Nintendogs. Not the best of
3523120	3529920	demos but just kind of seeing that they had this 3D version of it and being able to see
3529920	3535760	the ball go in the distance and then come back in his mouth. It was just really interesting.
3535760	3543280	I was really surprised by how much I ended up liking that little system. For me probably
3543280	3547680	two things. Number one I think what most people are probably thinking and surprised them about
3547680	3553000	E3 even sitting at home. Microsoft's and Nintendo's switching places this year where Microsoft
3553000	3557440	was totally catering to the casual crowd and Nintendo finally gave I think what a lot of
3557440	3562160	us were bitching about the past two years what we finally wanted. Yeah Kid Icarus namely
3562160	3566620	in the 3DS and just Reggie getting out there and going and here's a game and here's a game
3566620	3570840	and here's a game and now you shut the fuck up about how bad the Wii is. That's really
3570840	3578060	what his press conference was. Pretty cool. And then Microsoft just kind of really kind
3578060	3582400	of putting all their chips on the casual market so we'll see how it pays off for them. I don't
3582400	3586120	know I'm interested in some of the extra gaming. I gotta say the exercise gaming or whatever
3586120	3590200	it's called. Not feeling so much on the casual titles that are coming out for Kinect. So
3590200	3594440	we'll see if the gamble pays off. Sony's just kind of doing their thing and you know now
3594440	3598840	Valve's there and now they're going to have motion but unfortunately for Sony I don't
3598840	3602620	think there's a whole lot on the motion controller I feel like I have to have. I'm not going
3602620	3606720	to buy one because there's nothing I really want to play that needs the motion controller
3606720	3611280	but I will buy LittleBigPlanet 2 that's for damn sure. I'd like to comment real quick
3611280	3617800	about the role reversal. This E3 everybody knows that before this E3 it's Microsoft vs
3617800	3622600	Sony with Nintendo doing their own thing. Now it seems like it's Microsoft vs Nintendo
3622600	3628360	with Sony doing their own thing. It's very interesting how everything just kind of switched
3628360	3632880	with Microsoft still being like you know I'm going to bite off you and not care about these
3632880	3639140	other people. Just like they were doing with Sony to Nintendo and now Nintendo to Sony.
3639140	3643980	And in your comment in regards to the move I always feel like if I can find one game
3643980	3648560	that I know I will play a lot of for a system or accessory I will get it and that will be
3648560	3654920	time crisis. That's enough for me to justify at least a move controller maybe not the move
3654920	3659920	you know balancing stone or whatever it's called. Well we'll see maybe there will be
3659920	3663760	a game that will change my mind. Maybe it's Sing Star Dance who knows but I somehow doubt
3663760	3670800	it. Alright the thing that most surprised me otherwise DC Universe. I was like so I
3670800	3674880	just was loving that game and it's not. I was really caught by surprise. I thought it
3674880	3678960	was just going to be like another MMO I wouldn't really give a second thought to although I
3678960	3683640	thought the cross platform was cool. But yeah I definitely want to check that game out when
3683640	3687480	it comes out now. But you know what always happens to games we call one of the best of
3687480	3691040	E3. I'm not saying DC Universe is necessarily best of E3. I think that prize would really
3691040	3697760	go to 3DS but you know it usually happens with our best of E3 picks. They come out and
3697760	3705040	they're not so great. Remember Nintendogs anybody? Okay so Shane what about the thing
3705040	3709160	that disappointed you the most? Would it be like Microsoft like a lot of people at home
3709160	3714720	are thinking or? No I wouldn't say it was Microsoft because I'm not a huge fan of theirs
3714720	3721480	anyway I was actually you know kind of happy with them in terms of their new hardware.
3721480	3725520	Finally getting that wireless adapter built inside instead of having another hundred dollar
3725520	3734060	attachment to pay for. I would say what really disappointed me this E3 was the lack of playable
3734060	3739800	demos for big games that will sell tons of copies. If you didn't have an appointment
3739800	3744160	you couldn't play Guitar Hero. You couldn't play DJ Hero 2. You couldn't play the new
3744160	3749560	Call of Duty. You couldn't play anything at Bethesda. Portal 2 wasn't even anywhere in
3749560	3756360	playable form and that's a huge title. There was no announcements for Dragon Age 2 which
3756360	3761280	has already gotten a release date. Thank you Dragon Age Awakening for bundling that in
3761280	3768880	and teasing me. So I was just disappointed at the lack of playable big titles or even
3768880	3775420	titles that have been previously mentioned and were nowhere on the floor. I'll pretty
3775420	3778800	much agree with what Shane's saying as far as the biggest disappointment but I'll just
3778800	3782640	sum it up all in one game. The one game I would have really liked to play on the show
3782640	3788520	floor, that Child of Eden game looked pretty bad ass and I really wanted to check that
3788520	3792840	out and I was extremely disappointed I wouldn't be able to. Also there was a huge line for
3792840	3795760	Metroid Other M because it's the one thing in Nintendo I didn't end up playing because
3795760	3800640	I didn't want to sit in that line. I'll just have to check it out when the game comes out.
3800640	3805520	So you know we've kind of had 3DS dominate a lot of the conversation we've had over the
3805520	3809320	past couple days. So Shane I'll give you one more reason to talk about it. When do you
3809320	3815640	think the system is going to come out and how much? Place your bets. Okay so it's Nintendo.
3815640	3819320	They've never done a system that's been over $300. They've never done a handheld that's
3819320	3826040	been over $200. Actually $190 I think is the max they've gone with this DSi XL. I will
3826040	3831720	say that I would hope the system comes out at $200 because I don't think they'll go lower
3831720	3837280	than that. But I would expect the system to come out at $250 because of the technology
3837280	3842720	and all the stuff it can do. As for when it comes out they've already said it'll be by
3842720	3849720	the end of the fiscal year which will be March 2011. I will say and it'll be wrong but I'll
3849720	3856120	say in America we'll get it this holiday. My only reasoning for that is because Nintendo
3856120	3861280	has nothing for this holiday at all. They have nothing to compete with the move. Nothing
3861280	3867920	to compete with Kinect. I think the only real holiday titles they have coming are Donkey
3867920	3873520	Kong which I don't think is big enough to support the Wii, and Wii Party which is definitely
3873520	3879320	not big enough to support the Wii this holiday, and then for DS Golden Sun. And I'm not even
3879320	3883700	sure if that's towards the holiday or if it's just standard fall. So I'm going to go with
3883700	3892800	$250 realistically and this holiday. I'm going to say Nintendo goes all the way to March
3892800	3897040	2011. Actually no I'm going to say February 2011. Maybe they'll do like a Valentine's
3897040	3903120	Day thing I don't know. I'm going to say February 2011. I will also say $250 but you will get
3903120	3907200	a bundle in game and movie. I think you're going to get they're going to try to sweeten
3907200	3911420	the pot with some nice bundles. Although the game will not be Kid Icarus so don't get your
3911420	3916180	own tropes up. The game will be something else and the movie will be one of those Disney
3916180	3919320	things that are being demoed out on the floor. Although well maybe not. I guess it might
3919320	3924120	have to be something Nintendo related but we'll see. I think they'll do that or maybe
3924120	3929200	like you know what it'll be? It'll be a bunch of like 3D movie trailers. There'll be like
3929200	3934520	one cartridge that's just like 3D experience and it's going to be all these movies and
3934520	3937680	things we saw on the show floor just in one cartridge. I bet it will be that and then
3937680	3944680	like a game. And then I'm saying February 2011 and I'm just going to say Reggie's going
3944760	3949640	to try to push all those Wii titles for the holiday season. I think I disagree with Shane.
3949640	3954000	I think Wii Party as much as we don't think is enough to sustain them through their holiday
3954000	3957400	season. I think that's going to be their big holiday push. And then for the hardcore crowd
3957400	3962560	they're going to be like hey you got Goldeneye and you got the Kirby over here and all this
3962560	3968400	other stuff. Yeah Goldeneye was this year right? The demo we played felt really done
3968400	3973920	so I would think Goldeneye is maybe this year. I hear that the Zelda demo felt really done
3973920	3979440	too and that's not until next year. Thanks Nintendo. Oh I was going to say I thought
3979440	3985160	you meant Zelda on the 3DS and I was going to go well there's maybe your pack in game.
3985160	3989240	That no because they can make tons of money off of that. I was thinking maybe Nintendogs
3989240	3993960	and like nope that will make a ton of money. There's nothing that Nintendo showed that
3993960	4000040	they would pack in. Maybe another Metroid Prime first hunt or something. Again I think
4000040	4005920	it's going to be the 3D buffet. It's basically all the demos we saw on one cartridge. I wouldn't
4005920	4009520	put it past them though to do Nintendogs plus cats. Why not? They did a Nintendogs bundle
4009520	4016520	before. Maybe but I think that was after the game had already come out and it was for like
4016520	4021900	a special thanksgiving bundle. I feel like they could make too much money off of that.
4021900	4024380	And I didn't even think about this but the price of the games. I wonder if they'll be
4024380	4028600	higher than the DS or not because they're on new. It is a new format it looks like the
4028600	4033720	cartridges do look a little different. I have a picture. It's not the same. Of course they'll
4033720	4040720	be more expensive of course. About 5 to 10 dollars more expensive. No I can do 5 I can't
4040720	4047720	do 10. I do not want $50 handheld games. I'm sick of $40 ones already. Alright let's wrap
4047720	4054720	up. The thing you most want to see at E3 2011 or what one thing you want to see changed
4055080	4062000	for E3 2011? What I want to see changed? Not what game I want to see? Either. I'll do both.
4062000	4069000	I want less closed doors. You know if it's a press event all the press should be able
4069000	4073480	to see whatever. You shouldn't have to make an appointment. You should have a press only
4073480	4080000	area but not an appointment. Second thing I want to see? Or game I want to see? Uncharted
4080000	4086880	3. I don't even know. Next year I want to see them reopen Kensha Hall and not use it
4086880	4090440	as a parking lot. That would be pretty cool. Help thin out the crowds a little bit and
4090440	4095500	give the indies and foreign companies more place to grow. That would be really cool.
4095500	4101400	And I would like to see some of the game companies that are too good for booths these days come
4101400	4107520	back. That's what I would like to see happen. Yeah I'm kind of with Shane. I get the appointment
4107520	4111080	thing though. I understand. Especially with something like 14. I think they should have
4111080	4115400	done that by appointment. I think it should have been more like the Civ 5 thing where
4115400	4121840	someone else demoed it. But that's just me. I get it sometimes. So anyway that's it. We're
4121840	4126040	going to wrap up and call it a podcast. Thank you guys for listening to these special podcasts.
4126040	4128920	I know the audio quality has been kind of crap compared to the shows. I know you guys
4128920	4132900	miss Jamie's Classic Game of the Week and Loki's Rants. But don't worry. It is all coming
4132900	4137480	back this Sunday night. We're going to have DarkSakura and Loki and myself all kind of
4137480	4141260	wrapping up E3 all over again and picking up on some of the other news that happened
4141260	4146040	while the event was going on. So that's going to do it. Thank you so much for tuning in
4146040	4154980	and downloading the little show. Rob Robertson Pals, our E3 specials. See you Sunday night
4154980	4176960	for more Orange Lounge Radio. Goodbye.
