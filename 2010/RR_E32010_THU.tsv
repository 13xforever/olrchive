5407	9889	Alright, welcome back everybody to Rob Roberts and pals here on the Orange Lounge Radio feed.
9949	12611	It's our E3 wrap-up show, the final day.
13211	18074	Yes, sadly, E3 2010 is all done, and today we're not coming to you from a hotel room.
18534	27118	Actually, right now we are in the parking lot of In-N-Out Burger, where I've taken the one and only Bobby Blackwolf to his first In-N-Out experience.
27419	29700	And Bobby, hyped?
30320	30780	Too much?
30920	31441	Not enough?
31501	32481	What did you think of In-N-Out?
33282	33882	It was a burger.
36124	36544	DarkSakura.com
62878	71069	6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, but I really do urge you to tune in to the Bobby Blackwolf Show, who's right beforehand at 5 Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern.
71900	72080	Rock Band 3
97202	98183	That blew me away.
99344	100184	All the stuff they added.
100224	101485	I didn't realize how much they added.
101525	102946	I know you guys covered it already.
103506	105768	So I'm not really going to add to it right now.
106228	110791	But I will say one of the things I was able to... I played the keyboard and I played Pro Mode on Medium.
111352	114274	Which basically means that you have two notes at a time.
114774	116235	So two note chords and everything.
116876	124401	And one thing that they don't tell a lot of people, and one thing that you don't realize, is that they actually do have bumps on the keys.
125333	127655	To denote where the color changes.
127735	131037	So you don't have to look at the keyboard when they shift.
131577	134239	Because you can actually feel where the colors are.
134319	137081	So I thought that was... That's like one little tiny thing.
137101	138162	They don't really mention it.
138202	138882	They don't say it.
138942	140363	But that adds a lot.
142256	154599	So there was that, and I also did an interview, and it's going to be on E3Coverage.com, and I actually stumped the guy about the MIDI port, because the Guitar Hero drum set has a MIDI input.
155440	160621	Kind of like what they're saying, but it's not going to work for the Pro mode.
161301	165522	You could use it for the basic, but you're not going to be able to use it in the Pro modes of anything.
165582	168263	So that was interesting, and they are considering...
168763	170545	Portal 2 is hilarious Portal 2 is hilarious
191521	192422	He admitted that to me.
192482	196184	They are talking to him, asking him who he wants to work with to do it.
196224	198625	So he is definitely going to be a part of it for the music side.
200186	208411	But they've kept the humor and the gameplay elements they've added with the liquids, where you can either jump or slide really fast.
208491	214854	And some of the other objects that they've introduced really look like it's going to be a great title.
214894	216195	It's going to be a standalone title.
217996	219377	So I'm really looking forward to that.
220217	236840	One thing non-gaming that I saw today that probably won't interest the OLR audience as much, but it's more of a glimpse of what they can do in the future, is I actually got a behind-the-scenes demo of Kinect with the dashboard.
237661	245868	So showing the video chat and stuff where the Kinect camera seamlessly will zoom in and out based on who's in the frame.
245928	248690	So like if you're sitting on the couch alone, it'll be zoomed in on you.
248710	257317	If somebody sits next to you on the couch, it will automatically zoom out and put them in the picture, take the two of you into the picture and stuff like that, if that's the kind of thing you'd like to use.
258098	266305	But really, ESPN integration, it's not just watching ESPN3, which ESPN3 is their online...
267494	269455	The Ocho!
269815	270676	It's like the Ocho.
271076	278339	Basically, it's all the stuff that they have regionally that air on regional stuff, but not good enough for the national.
279440	290545	So you can watch anything online, like college football, if it's an out-of-market team for you, or if it's a very small school or something, they probably still have it on ESPN3.
291006	292466	And you don't just watch it.
292526	293747	They actually ask you...
295304	323443	who you're rooting for and it actually keeps track and here comes another plane the plane, the plane so it actually keeps track they showed us USC vs. Ohio State you're going to watch that college football game the first thing they ask you is who are you rooting for and then it tells you how many people percentages of people watching that on Xbox Live are rooting for that team and then it'll do trivia questions if you want that feature on and you're competing against the other fans while you're watching the game
324511	331357	and just stuff like that, you know, if they integrated that into ESPN, maybe other things, they would be able to integrate that same thing.
331858	338584	Do you think maybe for like, you know, women and the gays, as they say, we could get the Oscars in the same type of situation?
338964	341006	Although I'm so over the Oscars personally.
342055	347657	I think that would be awesome, where they would have people guess who might win and stuff, and who would get the award.
347677	348437	Who wore it best!
349098	350438	Yeah, and things like that.
352299	357621	There's very good opportunity there for that, and I was very impressed with that.
357781	360382	I got to use a little bit on the dashboard and stuff.
361562	364463	You still have to take very slow, deliberate movements.
364503	366544	You're not at the minority report level yet.
367116	370978	You can't just flick around or something because you'll wind up hitting something you don't want to hit.
371518	375120	They were taking very deliberate movements to do it.
375400	380943	But I'm very, I'm excited, I'm one of the few people excited for Kinect for all, you know, for just the dashboard.
381644	384645	Can I actually go back a little bit and talk about the video chat real quick?
384665	391209	Because, you know, obviously the, not the iToy, the Xbox Vision that we had before, you know, kind of had the video chat.
391249	395711	And, you know, I realize this is way upgraded, you know, better quality, it can zoom in and out and all this stuff, but
396344	405329	One thing I found about the video chat is that I rarely used it because it's kind of, you know, it's not like a cell phone where a cell phone's always on you and you pick it up, hit a button, you're good to go.
405769	412072	You know, I would think with a video chat, you both have to be on the 360 and then you have to, you know, kind of want to connect and so forth.
412532	413452	You know, I don't know.
414573	417795	It's like I get iPhone video chat, you know, if they ever get it on 3G, but
419302	427388	I kind of sit here going, okay, that sounds cool, but am I ever really going to use Connect Video Chat except the one time to say I did?
429009	429690	You might not.
430350	431011	Families might.
431071	432892	Now realize it's not just 360 to 360.
433193	436655	It's going to be with Windows Live Messenger.
437756	439938	And I believe they even said right at launch.
440718	447483	So you'll be able to talk to somebody if they have Windows Live Messenger on their computer and a webcam, you will be able to talk to them.
449190	451913	Okay, now that's a big thing I wasn't considering before.
451953	458720	I could see that now, then maybe like, you know, college kids trying to talk to parents or grandmas that are, you know, getting internet enabled in this day and age.
458740	459561	That makes a lot more sense.
460181	466748	And they also have Bing integrated with it where you could actually select... We're gonna wait for the plane.
467388	468469	The plane, the plane!
468790	469911	There we go, there goes the plane.
470877	477105	You can actually select top videos of entertainment stuff and you can both watch it at the same time.
477145	478607	They call them conversation starters.
479167	487298	So if you don't know what to talk about, somebody can select this video and it pops up in the center and so you're on each side and you can talk about that video.
488243	493564	I can see it now, us doing an entire episode of Orange Lounge Radio just of the Bing topic selections.
493864	496424	Oh my god, what an amazing podcast that would be.
496544	498905	Just the Bing video chat podcast.
498945	500085	Come on, you guys.
500245	500865	You know there's somebody.
501065	501805	Patent pending.
502345	502846	It's mine.
503006	503546	Don't take it.
504606	505246	I will sue you.
505966	506786	We could do it together.
507066	507906	Hey, there you go.
507966	508947	I could do it at my place.
508987	509887	You could do it at yours.
510427	510987	We'll record.
511027	512227	I've got the capture equipment.
512427	512787	Awesome.
513027	514488	And we could make it a video podcast.
515328	515908	There we go.
517730	521832	One other game I played, which was actually a music-based game, Power Gig.
522932	523952	I actually played this.
524893	530215	Now, this is the game, and somebody even asked me about it, I think, on my Sunday night show last week.
530235	531395	They were like, what do you think of Power Gig?
531415	534196	I'm like, oh, if it teaches you how to play guitar, it'll be great.
534456	534996	This one doesn't.
537017	538277	It uses a real guitar.
538337	544159	It looks like a real guitar, feels like a real guitar, but it's really still the same as Rock Band.
545380	545500	And
546429	548758	They actually, I didn't realize they had a drum peripheral.
550279	551719	The drum peripheral is air drums.
552220	556861	It's like, and since this is your crowd I can say this and they'll get it, it's like Para Para Paradise.
557641	567584	So you have drumsticks with sensors in them that break the plane of the pads, of the sensors shooting, or the lasers shooting up or whatever.
569405	579828	And basically there's four floor sensors that I guess are sending lasers upwards and the drumstick is sensing them and that's how it does
580899	581980	I don't play that way.
582020	582140	I play...
606837	612138	For any music geeks out there, I play matched grip, like you would in marching band.
612158	613279	That's how I play drum sets.
613339	616859	I don't really do the thumb-up grip, which is called French grip.
617099	618100	See, I'm a nerd, band nerd.
619040	621981	But a lot of drum set players do, so that's why they do it that way.
622321	623861	But you have to do it that way.
625501	627682	Because if the sensor's not going down, it's not going to register.
628122	631683	And I was having a problem getting one of the pads, the hi-hat pad, to register at all.
632587	638390	It wasn't registering most of the time, so it was not a very fun experience, but they said it was still beta hardware, and it's not the final version.
639351	648896	Can I just say though, and kind of go back a little bit again, since you invoked the name Parapara, something that kind of occurred to me today on the floor, maybe last night after we taped, I don't know,
649284	659830	But I realize I'm kind of, this E3 is really making me eat a fat slice of humble pie because for years, literally years on this program, I've kind of sat here and said, just give up.
659970	662172	Power of Paradise is never coming out in the U.S.
662212	663232	So you're not going to get it.
663572	664453	It's not happening.
664773	665994	People aren't going to get it here.
666134	666954	So shut up already.
666995	668135	It's not going to come out here.
668936	673078	Enjoy its cultness and the fact that it's a very niche thing.
673238	673779	Embrace it.
673799	674319	Have fun with it.
674819	676381	Boy, did I get proved wrong.
676901	684749	It's the most interesting thing to happen, but I swear, you guys, Dance Masters is, it's par par paradise.
684809	687532	I mean, you know, if you do the Night of Fire thing, it's the same thing.
687572	689413	They found a way to kind of get away with it here.
689794	696140	Now, granted, it's not exactly that, but that's as close, now, I will say this, and I will know I'm right.
696240	697201	I will know I'm right.
697731	700674	Take it or leave it, because this is the closest you're ever going to get.
701194	704858	For those that are Paradise fans, which I know we have some of those in the show.
705619	710723	As years old as that is, the camera thing will be pretty cool, I think.
710803	717129	The game itself looks neat, but a very interesting head-to-head that's going to happen with the Harmonix game, too.
717310	720673	Anyway, I don't mean to go back to old topics, but anything else you want to talk about, Bobby?
722168	722888	I'm trying to think.
723408	726229	I did get to play Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
729650	735211	I'm not really going to talk that much about the game because I only played it once or twice and it was button mashing and I lost.
736091	739932	I lost to Justin, the editor, the other guy that does E3 coverage.
740812	742993	I beat him in dancing though, so I'm a better dancer.
743573	754020	But I will say that in the interview with E3Coverage.com that I did, I did invoke Curly Mustaches and Pringles and the Knicks.
754480	759183	So if you're a fan, I invoke all of those in that interview.
761425	771071	And I played Wii Party, because it was a short line, and played the board game, which is kind of like Mario Party without the coins.
772049	773170	and played that for a little bit.
773950	775071	And it was kind of interesting.
775091	777132	Basically, the minigames are to determine the role order.
777732	779913	So that's just one of the many things in Wii Party.
779953	782395	It could be... I'm going to rent it, at least.
784236	788758	And, let's see, now I'm just stalling because I'm trying to think if there was anything else that I saw.
789939	790799	I don't think so.
790839	792220	I mean, Portal 2, hilarious.
793381	796222	OnLive, I didn't realize that OnLive is live now.
796983	798824	Like, it went live probably about an hour ago.
798844	799344	6 p.m.
799364	801325	Pacific is when they said it's going live for everybody.
802057	807242	and I think if you're a founding member you get one year free of OnLive for the PC and it worked on the show floor.
807823	811086	They claimed that the server was up in Silicon Valley.
812127	818834	I don't know if I believe them but if it's free for a year I might as well I might check it out and see it on my own home connection.
819935	823959	This is going to be huge for Mac gamers which I know is kind of an oxymoron but
824426	825267	I'm just kidding, guys.
825827	831350	The MacGamers, I mean, getting to kind of do all this streaming, this is going to open up a huge door, I think.
831951	834292	I would think that's where OnLive is going to be most successful.
834312	839456	But just watching it on the floor, you know, I didn't get the extensive demo you did, but I was like, is this for real?
839476	842898	Because it does look pretty smooth and pretty nice.
842978	849022	I mean, it's kind of one of those things that you know on the show floor, everybody's putting on their nicest, you know, front.
849062	852764	So I kind of wouldn't mind trying it on my home computer and see if it runs as well.
853493	857474	Um, Bobby, I know we're going to wrap up, get you to your flight and all that stuff.
857574	864856	And if people want to hear more, they can tune into you, you know, your Sunday night show or the one I always forget to plug because, you know, we're not on right after it, but it's also a great show.
865476	870258	The effing show, the fnglive.net, which is a video show that you guys do.
870318	875579	You're actually doing one Friday night, which really by the time most people hear this, knowing what time I'm getting home tonight, I'll probably be
875979	877900	Probably be tonight by the time most people hear this.
878881	883203	So tune into that as well at, I believe, 5 Pacific, 8 Eastern once again.
883303	884424	So check that out.
884804	886525	One last question for Bobby, though.
886625	891267	Kind of the thing that surprised you most about... And you've been to a lot of E3s.
891287	893369	You've been to about three times as many of them as I have.
893849	896730	Thing that surprised you most about E3 2010, Bobby?
896870	900733	Oh, God, you're putting me on the spot here.
906192	911774	It's kind of hard to say because I didn't see all that much because of the appointments and stuff.
913575	915156	With Microsoft, it was all interviews.
915276	917717	I never touched a game in the Microsoft booth.
918877	926820	Maybe what surprised me had nothing to do with anything on the show floor, although the game that shocked me was Driver San Francisco.
926900	928441	I didn't realize that would be that good.
929505	932548	But that could also be a good demo just like Split Second.
933709	943757	But it's more that I need to find a way to balance appointments and then having free time to go roam.
943817	949861	I literally only had about two and a half hours the entire week that didn't have appointments that I could actually roam the show floor.
949981	950842	Fourth day!
951082	951342	Yes.
952043	953124	I could use a fourth day.
953184	957087	I know everybody that works E3 is like, Oh God, no, I don't want a fourth day.
958007	961871	Oh my god, but everybody could fill up a fourth day of appointments too.
962511	965734	So it's too short.
966195	974782	But when I wasn't media and I was just showing up as exhibits only attendee as a developer, I was usually bored by the middle of day two.
975603	980047	And I finish up, Rock Band was my last thing that I saw.
980868	982209	And I'm like,
982782	983683	I could go another day.
984003	984804	I'm not done yet.
985544	994292	I'm sure there's going to be something I'm going to miss, and I'm going to kick myself for missing it, like Civ V. But yeah, I need more time.
994332	996794	I think that was the surprise, is that I need more time.
997717	998498	Alright, good answer.
998758	1000039	I was totally putting you on the spot.
1000059	1000740	That was a good answer.
1001140	1004003	So thank you so much, Bobby, and we'll talk as always on Sunday night.
1005184	1015374	Now, of course, Shane and I are still going to talk some games too, but we're going to go drop Bobby off at the airport, so we'll just do a little break here in the podcast-a-roo, and we'll be back sometime after the grapevine on I-5.
1015755	1016856	So stay tuned.
1017316	1021100	Okay, so we're back for the second half, although I'm kind of a terrible liar.
1021673	1048879	and it's almost 24 hours after we did that first half but we decided doing a podcast while trying to drive probably wasn't the best of ideas as boring as i5 is so yeah we took the safe route and came home and then of course we were really tired and that's stuff we want to do today but we still wanted to at least wrap up some of the stuff we saw on E3 day three while it's still fresh in our minds although I find that I'm on like game overload I played so much and I've been playing games since I got home because
1049266	1054488	Shane's like, you gotta play Alan Wake, and I have been, and it's been scary and all that, but I'll talk more about that on Sunday's show.
1055248	1068953	But anyway, while Shane is still here in California, we want to at least kind of go through some of the games we saw at E3 Day 3, and then of course we'll resume, you know, with all the rest of the news on Sunday night's show.
1069393	1075915	So, say hello to Shane, everybody, who's back with us here on this Rob Robertson Pals Thursday, kind of Friday edition.
1076812	1086398	It's actually been over 24 hours since we were supposed to do it because it's now almost 11 here and we stopped at like 7 yesterday, but hi.
1087939	1091182	You know, through the magic of radio, people would have never known, but that's alright.
1091542	1092863	Alright Shane, let's get to the games.
1093203	1094584	Give us some games that you want to talk about.
1095683	1099565	Alright, I actually wrote these all down in a random order, so I'll go in a random order.
1100666	1101026	No, I won't.
1101286	1102687	Castlevania Lords of Shadow.
1102887	1106869	It's the new Castlevania game coming out for the 360 and the PS3.
1107969	1111071	Pretty much a God of War style game.
1112611	1128557	The demo definitely made me want to play more of it because it had some interesting features like there's a part where you're on mounted combat and when you get knocked off because I'm terrible at it you have to fight through enemies before your little sparkle horse comes back so you can start riding again.
1129517	1130798	Very graphically pretty.
1131498	1133399	Kind of reminded me of like looking at a painting.
1134259	1137300	So had some slowdown issues but it's okay I liked it.
1138311	1145092	Yeah, I'm hoping some of the framerate issues was just because it's still a beta and some of these things are really hard to judge from early demo builds.
1145192	1160776	But the only thing that kind of got me about the game was that I think a lot of people who weren't happy with the direction Castlevania took in the PS1 and PS2 versions are going to be really disappointed
1161801	1165308	I think by what they're doing here because it didn't really feel like a Castlevania game to me.
1165648	1174485	In fact, if I remember right, I read somewhere that this game originally started as a totally different game and then they kind of, I guess, retconned the Castlevania thing into it.
1175089	1177450	Now, it was not a bad game by any means.
1177530	1193496	I actually thought it was really cool and pretty and enjoyable, but I think some people that were expecting the old-style, you know, whipping Castlevania games are going to be in for a surprise, because Shane's right, it plays a lot more like God of War, kind of Bayonetta, it felt like a little bit to me, too, with some of the cutscenes.
1193576	1197937	But, again, very pretty, and I still think probably going to be worth your time checking out when it comes out.
1198937	1203299	Now, if you do want kind of that old-school 2D experience, I got a little time with the arcade version
1204509	1215494	Game, which is the Harmony of Despair Castlevania game, which I think we had talked about a little bit the day before, but I actually hands-on played it on the last day of E3, and I enjoyed it.
1215574	1222017	Shane, I don't think felt so favorably about it, but I kind of like the whole Neo Geo effect of the zoom in and out.
1222921	1229204	If you ever played the fighting games on the OGO, how it kind of like zooms way in and out and stuff on the action, you can kind of control that in the Castlevania game.
1229725	1233046	And it was very inspired by Symphony of the Night, which I thought was cool.
1233567	1235408	So it's basically a race from start to finish.
1235468	1237809	You have like 10 minutes to kind of get through the castle.
1238309	1243272	And I know the demo castle I played was kind of hard because it seemed like there really was only one path through the castle.
1243712	1244614	but I couldn't figure it out.
1245114	1250943	Unfortunately the demo on the floor didn't give a lot of exposition as to what all the features were and the people at least where I was at.
1250963	1259035	I played it at Microsoft's booth and I don't think the people there were as on the up and up on what the game was all about so unfortunately
1259768	1262751	I was a little bit kind of like lost, I guess, as to all the features.
1262831	1264752	But, you know, I enjoyed what I played.
1265332	1269195	And, you know, I'm pretty sure the arcade game will probably cost $10, maybe $15.
1270136	1271197	And it'll probably be worth it.
1271417	1273479	I will probably pay and at least check out the full version.
1273899	1275580	If not, at least the trial, for heaven's sake.
1276441	1279023	Fable 3 was another game I checked out at Microsoft's booth.
1279683	1282886	And Fable 3, again, the demo...
1284119	1289901	Didn't really give you a lot, at least for me, of what is really different about the game from Fable 2.
1290341	1294943	I noticed a lot of the gold trail was kind of back from the other Fable games.
1295583	1299465	And the difference I saw was that you could dress up in a giant chicken suit for one of the quests.
1300806	1303226	But they weren't running it on Kinect or whatever.
1303246	1306388	Because, right, Fable 3 is supposed to have some Kinect stuff, supposedly.
1306828	1308849	But they weren't really showing any of that on the floor.
1308909	1309829	So I've got to be honest.
1310433	1333685	I didn't see a whole lot that was really different from Fable 2, and most of the people I talked to, same thing, but, I mean, that's not really a bad thing, Fable 2 was a great game, it was one of the better games that came out that year it came out, so, more of the same in this case, not necessarily a bad thing, and I'm sure there's some other stuff, like, you know, it seemed to be like there was a couple more interactions and things you could choose from, so, I mean, that part of it's cool, so...
1334107	1335588	That was pretty much my impressions of Fable 3.
1336249	1337670	I'll check that out when it comes out too.
1338931	1343074	So while Rob was playing Fable 3, I was just around the corner playing Crackdown 2.
1344155	1345677	And seriously, it was just Crackdown.
1345917	1346918	That's all it was.
1347478	1353583	And it was a 30 minute demo, which I actually didn't spend the whole 30 minutes playing, but I definitely could have easily.
1353963	1354684	It was still fun.
1355117	1356017	It was hilarious.
1357398	1360278	And there were agility orbs, and that's all you need in a Crackdown game.
1361779	1370381	I didn't play a whole lot of the first game, so this might be a new feature, but you can capture points and then call helicopters down to give you more weapons.
1371141	1374362	And the more proficient you are with guns, the better weapons you get.
1375077	1379801	So it actually really made me want to get one of those sleek new 360s.
1381382	1385225	So I was happy with it, and I guess it comes out in a couple months, or next month.
1386106	1387287	What's wrong with the old 360s?
1387307	1388368	Why can't you just get one of the old 360s?
1389761	1391002	They aren't the shiny new ones.
1391702	1399407	Plus, I would like to have a wireless adapter and this one's built in instead of paying an extra hundred dollars.
1399808	1400188	Dollars?
1400588	1401009	Dollars.
1402289	1405271	So in other words, what they really should have had the first time.
1406572	1410995	Yes, and if it breaks it can't red ring technically because there are no red lights inside.
1411135	1413557	So if it breaks it's going to be three green rings of death.
1415442	1418304	or hopefully they've just built it this time so it doesn't break.
1418364	1419746	But that's another issue altogether.
1419786	1420846	I'm digressing a little bit.
1421247	1423328	So what is next on our list?
1423368	1424809	Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
1426211	1427652	You know, the demo was limited.
1427672	1429553	It only had about, what, 8, 10 characters?
1429613	1430134	I don't remember.
1430974	1432255	I mean, I guess that's still a lot.
1432476	1435958	10 characters was as many as they had in the original Street Fighter, right?
1435998	1436999	No, the original Street Fighter was just 8.
1437099	1437980	Anyway.
1438020	1438120	Okay.
1439033	1439593	It was cool.
1439813	1444834	It was very stylistic, you know, as a lot of you guys have seen in the trailers.
1444914	1447355	To me, it plays just like Marvel vs. Capcom 2.
1447675	1452436	Keep in mind, I'm not on my up and up on fighting games, so I'm not the best authority to talk about these types of games.
1452776	1459097	But to me, it played a lot like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, but definitely had that more like kind of like Cell style that you've seen in a lot of the commercials.
1459577	1468139	Not as much of the 2D, 3D switching as I would have thought based on the trailer and the fact that it kind of was supposed to be a little more Street Fighter 4, I thought.
1469259	1476223	So, graphically, you know, it's kind of like a souped-up arcade release, but I think it's going to be pleasing for the fans.
1476303	1486087	And some of the supers do the 3D thing a little bit, at least it was in the demo, but again, early, early, early build, and then had huge lines going for it all day at the Capcom booth.
1486888	1493631	The trick to getting to play the game quickly was to go to Microsoft's booth, or even Sony's booth, and play the game there, which is what we did.
1494949	1495670	I really liked it.
1495990	1498713	I'm not a huge fan of the Marvel vs. Capcom games.
1498773	1500935	I already like Capcom vs. SNK.
1501535	1513887	But the one thing I noticed about it is because of the size of the characters and the screen amount that you have to play in, it felt like the game was going a little too fast compared to the other ones.
1514588	1517251	Sometimes it was kind of hard to keep up with what was going on.
1517931	1527018	and as a button masher because I don't know how to play Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and I picked, I think, all new characters except for Iron Man.
1527178	1528379	Chris Redfield sucks.
1529200	1531962	Like, utterly, utterly terrible character.
1532942	1535004	Slow and just awful.
1535064	1536525	But Dante was really cool.
1536705	1540288	I will definitely, when I play this game, will be playing as Dante.
1542649	1542930	Awesome.
1543110	1545211	Yeah, I pretty much played with standard characters.
1545271	1546092	Felicia, Morgan...
1546567	1547667	Ryu, all that fun stuff.
1548247	1552788	All right, so I finally made good on my promise to get some hands-on with the PlayStation Move.
1553268	1556889	Unfortunately, the line to get to all the really good games was really long.
1557709	1564791	But some of the like littler games that didn't have quite the, you know, like the bowling game and some other stuff didn't have quite the long lines to get to them.
1564831	1569271	So the game I got to play was the Toy Story game, which, you know, it's not a bad game.
1569311	1570632	There's certainly an audience for it.
1570672	1572252	It's definitely directed at a younger audience.
1572665	1573427	Thanks for watching!
1586023	1588264	You know, it's more of a point the move at the screen.
1588284	1589845	It doesn't even use the second controller.
1589885	1592747	It's just the one stick and you just kind of aim it at the screen and shoot.
1593207	1594067	Very logical.
1594427	1596929	But you know, I was able to at least kind of get my hands on it.
1597049	1599570	I like the way that controller kind of felt to hold.
1600390	1603452	It is a little weird with the whole like lollipop look that it has.
1604028	1609954	And it's kind of funny because when you shoot a certain square in the Toy Story game, it'll activate rapid fire.
1609974	1613237	So you just hold down the button to shoot the balls everywhere at the targets.
1613657	1618382	But your little ball on the top of your controller starts spazzing out and turning all these rainbow colors.
1618422	1618982	It's all pretty.
1619503	1622946	So kids will get a kick out of it if you have one of those households where
1623396	1651487	you know mom and dad really like to play their more hardcore PlayStation games but you want some stuff for the kids too I think that's going to fit in very nicely with the collection or if you're you know a Disney nut or you really like Midway Mania it was it was cute although I didn't I gotta be honest I was talking to the demo guy about a bunch of like other things besides just the game so I couldn't tell you like how extensive the game's gonna be but you know what it's it's a Toy Story game it's you know what you're gonna get
1653406	1662353	On the other hand, when I got to play The Move, I went to a more, I don't know, real game, and I ended up playing Time Crisis, the new one.
1662373	1663714	I don't remember the subtitle.
1664354	1664715	Oh well.
1665936	1666496	It was great.
1666836	1669098	The Move controller works really well for Time Crisis.
1669679	1671200	It's a very, very quick game.
1671560	1673241	in response time when you move it around.
1673641	1675382	I was getting headshots left and right.
1676243	1677323	I had no problems playing it.
1677604	1683147	In fact, I kind of played, I guess you could consider it twice, because I played with two different people next to me.
1683187	1684007	I just didn't want to leave.
1684688	1687909	And I always totally outdid the other people.
1688790	1700777	But I did talk to the rep that was there, and he told me that the game is not only going to have the on-rails shooter like we all know from Time Crisis, but it will also have one part of the game where you can just move around and shoot things too.
1701317	1703778	So you're not stuck to those rails.
1704118	1711359	And also, he informed me that the retail copy will come with a move-enhanced version of Time Crisis 4.
1712139	1714160	So you kind of get three games in one.
1715160	1719261	Which is great, because Time Crisis 4, if it's free, it's good.
1719381	1721401	I mean, it's a terrible, terrible Time Crisis game.
1721461	1723642	But this new one is really fun, so I'm excited.
1725323	1742512	One of the cool things real quick about it was that the button on the top of the controller acted like your foot pedal in the arcade so you would release it when you want to reload and keep your shield up and then you would hold it down and then press the trigger button on the underside of the controller when you'd want to fire.
1744073	1747615	Now if you take Time Crisis off the rails though, is it still really Time Crisis?
1748869	1777550	I don't know I can't see me playing that off the rails section of the game that much because it did sound like they were two completely separate parts of the game like you can just play the rails game or you can play the free roaming one I don't know how the free roaming one will work and it'll require for sure at least the what the Sony nunchuck whatever it's called to move around because I don't think you can really move around with just the move controller
1778769	1781550	The Navigation Controller, if I'm not mistaken, is what they call it.
1782510	1793213	I like to call it the, I think it was like Balancing Rock from WarioWare, Smooth Moose, because those little intro things are hilarious.
1794974	1796054	And here's the microphone back.
1796854	1801736	Alright, so we went over to Nintendo's booth for a little bit and caught up on some of the stuff besides the 3DS.
1802509	1808751	Although we did spend a heck of a lot of time with the 3DS again, which I'll let Shane start in a minute, but I do want to talk about the other games we got our hands on real quick.
1809231	1817734	Some of the stuff we've been kind of teasing on the Sunday show a little bit, Wii Party, which I know Loki was kind of making fun of because, oh my gosh, another minigame collection on the Wii.
1817774	1818334	Who would have thought?
1818754	1824156	But this appears to be probably one of the bigger Wii titles they're going to push this holiday, at least for the family unit.
1824596	1830898	And it did seem like there were tons of minigames, but not necessarily like the same stuff you would see in other games.
1830978	1832138	It seemed like you would have these
1833024	1834165	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1863376	1867337	Well, it's not my fault you're terrible at Wii Party and you don't take direction well.
1867897	1873719	But anyway, we were playing this thing where there was a boat and you didn't want to tip the boat over.
1874299	1878700	But you had to play little mini-games to get the people that you would put on the boat.
1878820	1881261	And if you passed the mini-game, they would be the same weight.
1881701	1884482	But if you didn't pass the mini-game, they would be fat and skinny.
1885092	1885752	and that's bad.
1885792	1886413	You don't want that.
1887293	1890094	But it's really funny when the boat tips over and everybody falls in.
1890134	1891095	That was my favorite part.
1891155	1893435	So it was almost like worth it to lose miserably.
1893936	1894836	So that was Wii Party.
1895216	1895976	I'm going to be honest.
1895996	1901679	I don't know if this is one I would necessarily buy because I don't have a lot of parties at my one bedroom apartment.
1902079	1914524	But I think for the people, if you are getting a lot of use out of Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort and the other major Nintendo releases for party games, this is kind of a next logical step that I'm sure will end up in a lot of households.
1917241	1918922	I liked Wii Party a whole lot.
1919162	1927505	My only thing about it is if they try to charge $50 for it and not throw in like an extra controller or something, it's not worth it.
1928205	1932967	It was really fun, but like $25 fun.
1933267	1935088	Nothing higher than that.
1935768	1943511	But after we moved on from Wii Party, we went to the Mario Sports Mix game, which was interestingly enough on the tile screen showed that it was
1944251	1948012	in part developed by Square Enix, so what the crap.
1949312	1953613	It had volleyball and basketball on it, and we played volleyball, and Rob was terrible.
1954053	1959414	But I was really good because I got us some points, and I was very good at blocking the shots from coming over.
1959894	1960374	It was fun.
1960554	1961874	The volleyball was a blast.
1961894	1969336	I kind of wish we had demoed the basketball too, but the volleyball had really simple controls, and it was a good time.
1970994	1977098	It's unfortunate that Shane would lie like that and say that I'm so terrible when I was the only one running around grabbing all the power-ups, but that's okay.
1978599	1981761	Here's the thing though, I gotta be honest, the game was almost a little too simple for me.
1981982	1988406	This is really a kid's game, and you know, it's fine for that audience, but you know, I think for the rest of us,
1989432	1993134	I think a lot of people are just going to see it as like, woo, more of the Wii Sports type of stuff.
1993575	2001039	You know, again, if you have that mixed household that has the kids and the teenagers maybe even that would get a kick out of this, it would probably be worth it.
2001079	2007764	Before the quote-unquote hardcore gamer, which is probably most of the folks that listen to this show, I couldn't really take Mario Sports Mix seriously.
2008144	2017830	And, you know, they try to incorporate some of the Mario elements into it, like the red shells, you know, and cute little things like that, but I couldn't take it seriously.
2020402	2024523	Which I think is unfortunate because I think it'd be a good relaxing game.
2025384	2031506	Again, not a $50 game, which they will charge for it, but a pretty good one just to kind of hang out and do nothing.
2032266	2038148	Well, if I want to play a relaxing game, I'll just play Wii Relax, which was totally absent from E3 this year.
2038248	2038828	Who would have thought?
2039881	2050690	It was like Nintendo knew to keep Cammy Dunaway and the Wii Vitality Sensor away from E3 so nobody would get mad at them, which is great.
2051250	2057996	But moving on to the most important part of the show, I think, we went back through the 3DS line.
2058636	2067082	which was fantastic to actually get to go back through and really spend some quality time with some of the games, demos, and videos.
2068563	2075068	I will say that they had a DJ Hero game on there, which I didn't even really realize.
2075128	2079231	I know they had mentioned it before, but I didn't know it was up there to play.
2079732	2081273	I was so pumped when I saw it.
2081373	2083795	I hopped right over, and it is an amazing game.
2084575	2087177	It's all the bottom screen, the touchscreen.
2088078	2093841	You have three tracks still, but you only have the little note circles in the middle.
2093921	2095923	So you just tap the screen wherever you want for that.
2096303	2097184	And then to slide...
2098288	2099730	You are a crossfader to the left or right.
2099770	2101252	You slide the stylus on the screen.
2101832	2102834	And it was really good.
2103034	2110583	And the 3D effects made it kind of neat to see the track, so to speak, come at you as you're playing.
2112526	2114368	And you played the DJ Hero, didn't you?
2114730	2117894	No, no, he's shaking his head, so I guess I won't have the mic back over.
2120177	2122701	I also played the Professor Layton game.
2122881	2126866	It was like Mirror of Something working title, so whatever.
2127207	2129049	Professor Layton 3DS, there we go.
2130470	2131010	It was cool.
2131391	2144394	It was Professor Layton, but instead of the typical static screen where you touch things to find clues, you have a 3D screen on top and you can use this magnifying glass on the bottom screen.
2144434	2152957	You move it around and your magnifying glass will change into an orange filled magnifying glass if you find something to technically click on.
2154218	2154919	That was cool.
2156081	2164331	The puzzle that you got while playing was just the standard Professor Layton puzzle.
2164371	2165653	I had to put a robot together.
2166994	2168116	So it wasn't anything big.
2168676	2170058	And I didn't really use the 3D.
2171279	2174180	But that was okay, because it was still really fun in Professor Layton.
2175380	2176840	I also played Pilotwings.
2177961	2179721	It was just a short demo.
2179981	2182001	I flew a plane through some rings.
2182782	2190183	It kind of felt like Wii Sports Resort, more so than Pilotwings, but that's what they've been making recently.
2190263	2191083	So, hey, here's Rob.
2191843	2193084	Sorry, I ran to the other room real quick.
2193404	2195524	Can I comment real quick, though, on Professor Layton?
2195544	2196604	Because I also checked this out.
2196685	2198305	I don't play the Professor Layton games, though.
2198725	2198885	It was...
2199692	2215995	Let me explain though, when you were up there demoing the 3DS, it was just a lot, probably all those women you saw at the press conference were now sitting up on the 3DS stage where you would go up there and they all had DSs tied to them, but the only kind of like problem was there were no signs saying what game was where.
2216415	2224337	So you kind of would just walk up to women and see what game they had, you know, which, you know, it's hard to kind of walk away too once you kind of get sucked into a game.
2225015	2229078	So I checked out Professor Layton even though I don't know the DS games at all like Shane does.
2229398	2235323	But I will say the one thing I noticed was that the 3D effects were probably the most sharp of almost anything that I demoed.
2236363	2245250	You know, my 3D can sometimes be really picky, but I thought Layton had probably some of the best 3D that I saw.
2245430	2251755	Even though it wasn't like gimmicky 3D, like pop-out things shooting at you, I thought it was just kind of some of the sharpest 3D.
2253328	2259330	And I think the art style of Professor Layton really is a good match for the way they did the 3D.
2259450	2263512	It was almost like a pop-up book, so to speak.
2264632	2268794	So I was saying, yeah, Pilotwings, it's just kind of Wii Sports Resort.
2268834	2269274	It was fun.
2270635	2272135	Then I played Ridge Racer.
2272815	2273736	Didn't really care for it.
2273796	2276477	I think it's the first handheld Ridge Racer I did not like.
2277257	2279038	But you played some of Ridge Racer, didn't you?
2280009	2285778	Yeah, I mean, the controls were kind of dopey, like, and just it was not realistic at all when you would run into walls.
2286319	2292269	I'm trying not to be too harsh, though, because, you know, early, early, early, I think it's more of a concept than anything like the actual game.
2292964	2293484	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2323553	2328736	I really, really think it's unfair to judge a whole game based off these very, very conceptual demos.
2329256	2332557	This just wasn't one that made me jump up and down like some of the other concept demos did.
2333818	2341862	I would say we have to say maybe conceptual demos because we don't know when these games are coming out and some of them actually felt pretty polished for demos.
2343567	2344348	I guess that's true.
2344408	2352095	If this is the game, though, I would totally pass on it until the Mario Kart game comes out, as far as I'm concerned.
2353176	2357500	Let's see, one of the games I checked out was Kingdom Hearts, although it was not really a game.
2357540	2361564	It was just kind of a concept thing where you would watch pre-rendered video.
2362324	2366028	So really all I can say about it was that it was kind of like watching the opening on the PS2.
2366288	2366829	I mean, it was...
2368001	2375584	The 3D was, you know, there wasn't a lot going on, but I was more impressed that, wow, this is like PlayStation 2 style graphics on the DS.
2375685	2380387	That was, you know, not quite at that caliber, but almost.
2380467	2383608	Definitely a step above where it was at before, so that was pretty awesome.
2384949	2389851	One of the other games I played that I think Shane didn't was Samurai Warriors, which was like half video, half playable demo.
2390847	2392128	And that was cool.
2392168	2393709	I mean, the playable demo was very simple.
2393749	2396070	It was just kill 50 warriors really quick.
2396090	2398131	But the 3D was, they used a lot of it.
2398651	2407175	And, you know, not just the depth and running around killing the warriors, but then like, you know, little anime overlays would come up when you do special moves and those kind of pop out.
2407255	2408276	And I thought that was pretty cool.
2410785	2415286	and a game I know I played that Rob didn't was Nintendogs plus cats.
2416607	2420808	Unfortunately they didn't have the cats but they did have a couple breeds of dogs.
2420888	2424589	I actually did switch between breeds just to see if there's any real differences.
2425209	2426370	It was Nintendogs.
2427530	2433872	Probably the coolest thing about it was when I threw the ball and the ball went 3D into the back and then he came running
2434352	2437914	Back With It, and you know, it was 3D and Nintendogs.
2438174	2442456	It's going to be boring after a few days, but you know, the first couple days you'll really enjoy it.
2444357	2447619	I also saw a few videos, and I'll just quickly hit on those.
2447879	2450060	Paper Mario, beautiful game.
2451401	2452701	It is like a pop-up book.
2452781	2453642	It was really cool.
2454842	2456403	Metal Gear, amazing.
2457203	2460104	I hear a lot of people think it's one of the best videos on the floor.
2460564	2461124	I can agree.
2461264	2462524	You could move the camera around.
2462604	2464665	It'll look like a PS2 game, but in 3D.
2464985	2465645	It's really neat.
2467045	2472067	I saw Dead or Alive on videos, just really briefly, because I was like, I don't care about Dead or Alive.
2472107	2473727	But graphically, it looked pretty nice.
2475028	2480149	And then the worst video goes to Resident Evil, because for some reason...
2480909	2508026	I could not find the right angle to look at it I looked at it straight on like every other demo and sometimes it would be you know in focus and sometimes it would be crazy couldn't understand why but that was my entire 3d oh no wait I took pictures with the 3d camera they had that off to the side I had to hunt for it and those were really cool you can actually adjust
2509386	2522912	Like, you know, with the slider, how the 3D looks, but there was also like an option to toggle how the actual 3D looks instead of just making a flat image, you could kind of change the perception on the 3D image itself.
2524053	2528275	I'm kind of pissed I didn't see that, because that was one of the few things I really, really wanted to see.
2529435	2536939	Let's see, out of those that you talked about, I also saw the Resident Evil one, and I also had a difficult time really seeing the 3D in it, but graphically, wow.
2537546	2543136	Wowie wow, I mean, I don't know if that was pre-rendered video, I'm assuming it was, but if not, wowie wow.
2544696	2554484	Otherwise, I think the only other game I can think of off the top of my head was Sims 3 that I saw on the DS and the only real feature they were showing off was again about picture taking.
2554524	2558407	You could actually take a picture of yourself using the camera and it would model your face on the character.
2558847	2565532	I don't think though, I haven't played the DS one that's out there now, but I'm pretty sure it has that same feature, at least for the DSi.
2566633	2567534	So, you know, whatever's.
2569251	2576732	Until I heard that the line was four hours towards the end of the day, I did want to go back because I somehow missed the Star Fox demo.
2576972	2579933	I really, really wanted to play that because I heard nothing but good things.
2580893	2583353	So I apologize to anybody that wants to hear it.
2583513	2585294	I really wanted to play it, but just missed it.
2587094	2587414	Ditto.
2587654	2590195	I just wanted to get my hands on as much stuff as possible.
2590275	2594935	Even if it was games I wasn't super familiar with, I just wanted to see as much 3D as possible.
2595676	2598396	Some of the pre-rendered videos, though, they had were really impressive.
2599715	2608222	What they kind of did to really help the line situation was that they actually had gals walking around the line a little bit, kind of showing off the DSs they had.
2608583	2611305	So you could actually see the three DSs before you really got on the stage.
2611645	2614648	But all they would show was just like some pre-rendered concept videos.
2615028	2620233	But man, there was one, and I know Shane feels differently about this one, but there was one with like a champagne cork popping up.
2620726	2623589	and like all the confetti and streamers would pop out of the bottle.
2624050	2632359	And it was the one thing where I really felt like the images were not going in a hall or whatever, like the depth is going back.
2632860	2635022	I felt like the images were really popping out.
2635082	2637405	Like it was really astounding.
2638707	2646272	My favorite thing from that video, and you're right, I did not like the champagne bottle popping with the streamers.
2646772	2655018	Not because I thought it was terrible looking, it just kind of made me a little bit dizzy feeling because of the way my eyes were focusing on it.
2655218	2667125	But they had a pre-rendered picture that you can move around of Pikmin, and I love Pikmin, and that made me really, really, really need a Pikmin game for this 3DS.
2668973	2669693	I'm sure you'll get it.
2669733	2671234	There's like everything else coming out.
2671755	2677879	So, alright, what else to kind of wrap up here besides 3DS did we get our hands on?
2678959	2679279	The what?
2679359	2679980	The Square Booth?
2680480	2682201	Oh, we want to talk a little Final Fantasy XIV?
2684282	2686784	The four, okay, Shane's telling me to talk about the Four Heroes of Light.
2687104	2688405	Well, I didn't play a whole lot of it.
2688505	2690586	I mean, I don't really know what it's today.
2691007	2693888	It felt like the other Final Fantasy games that are on the DS right now.
2694449	2696310	I guess the big thing is H.A.T.S.,
2696874	2713413	you put on hats and it changes your jobs and anybody can be like any job so I guess maybe it's got like a five thing going with it but I really didn't spend enough time with a floor demo to really comment any further I think if you like the Final Fantasy 3 and 4 on DS this is probably right up your alley
2715365	2716486	I played it a little bit too.
2717106	2721609	Unfortunately, the demo I picked up, somebody had just finished playing and they died.
2722470	2726673	So one of my characters was dead and I had no magic to use, so it was really boring to me.
2727133	2739101	But for me, the 3DS versions of the Final Fantasy games felt too slow, and this one was no exception, so I was not really digging it.
2740657	2741297	You're just a hater.
2741618	2742518	But I will say this.
2743199	2747341	I thought it was really cute how in the demo they definitely had programmed it as an E3 demo.
2747701	2755686	It really reminded me of a few years ago there was a Katamari Damacy game coming out that was specifically for E3 and the king would talk about E3 and stuff.
2756067	2758328	That was kind of similar to this little demo they had.
2758668	2762491	The little characters in the village talked about, you know, we worked really hard on this demo.
2762511	2763551	We hope you enjoy it.
2763951	2764652	It was really funny.
2765592	2767334	I like cute little things like that.
2767374	2769735	It makes the demo games feel that much more special.
2770802	2773303	That's like the ghost trick demo that we played.
2773923	2780246	They had a lot of references to how it was just a demo, that the retail version would be different, and that was fun.
2780486	2782647	And oh my god, the dog in that game is adorable.
2782867	2786148	I know we've already talked about it, but it was great.
2787108	2789669	Now let's bring this podcast down a little bit.
2789889	2792990	I went to play Final Fantasy XIV.
2793471	2795591	The good news is the character creation is fun.
2796812	2798372	It's got some really nice options.
2798792	2802154	Especially if you played XI, you know you were very limited in what you can do.
2802274	2809176	But this one gives you not a whole bunch more options, but far more than you ever had in Final Fantasy XI.
2810016	2811937	I had highlights in my hair that were blue.
2812477	2813198	I could change...
2814898	2819981	to many different hairstyles, many different eye colors, many different skin colors.
2821121	2830946	They also had adjustable voices, adjustable features like scars and stuff like that, and nose and chins and mouth options.
2831006	2831546	It was crazy.
2832236	2834519	The bad news is the combat is awful.
2835079	2835980	Absolutely terrible.
2836781	2843148	They told us that the beta build that we were playing was different from the current alpha that players are playing right now.
2844109	2852058	The combat is one of the most clunky combat schemes I've ever seen, and I played Final Fantasy XI, so I know clunky combat.
2853738	2859120	So what they had us do was get into a party and start this thing called a guild leave, which was awesome.
2859160	2870443	It's a quest where you can select different styles of play like solo, duo, party, something else, and like all your servers.
2871291	2886081	something like that for difficulty so you can get better rewards or maybe do a quicker quest and still do the same quest but they had three of us join up as a group and we had to go kill crabs
2886961	2893666	So we found the crabs after some terrible walking with bad cameras, but they said the cameras will be fixed, so hopefully that's true.
2894447	2895127	Found the crabs.
2895647	2899530	The first thing you have to do before you initiate battle is unsheathe your weapon.
2899910	2900711	Not a big deal.
2901372	2903253	Then you have to target your enemy by clicking on it.
2904188	2904669	and so on.
2918166	2923071	So once you do that and you make sure your enemy's targeted, you will unleash attacks.
2923511	2929658	The combat though is so fast that you just don't have time to really think about what you're doing.
2931279	2940949	And there's no on-screen text besides in your little chat log to tell you if you're too far away or if you can't perform that action.
2941565	2961587	constantly I thought I had the enemy targeted but I accidentally clicked on myself so nothing was happening but I didn't really realize this because there were not enough on-screen commands to tell me I was doing something wrong I really really hope they fix that because I mean I'll still get the game I won't be able to help myself but
2962429	2966791	It's going to make the game a little less fun for me if I can't even attack an enemy.
2967251	2970932	Granted, I was a class I never would have played to begin with, the gladiator class.
2971512	2975414	I definitely would have been the mage or the lancer had I known I just had to sit at a different chair.
2977514	2984677	But, I don't know, I don't have high hopes for the combat, especially since it's just not that great.
2986607	2989328	Here's the thing, I think Shane is being a little harsh on the game.
2989408	2998412	I will say this, just I observed, because Shane wouldn't let me play, but the game was beautiful, oh my god, it was so pretty to look at, especially for an MMO, I thought it was great.
2999032	3006115	I just think that, I think this is a game that is very hard for Square to demo at an expo like E3.
3006635	3015719	I think a game like this takes a big learning curve, and I think that's part of the reason Shane had a lot of problems, is that I think he got thrown right into this thing,
3016159	3040156	and kind of was being told okay do this now this now this now this you know I'm almost kind of like you know what the dude should have just sat there and played it we should have watched I mean I think it was just too much for Shane to kind of like have to do it once I think when you play the actual game you'll kind of learn how to do it piece by piece like remember how the biggest complaint about 13 it takes forever to unfold well you know a lot of it's teaching you a little piece of the game at a time and I just think the way they demoed it
3040516	3042357	Kind of bit them a little bit.
3042477	3045698	I think when the actual game comes out, it won't bug Shane as much.
3045878	3046798	That's just personal knowledge.
3047698	3050079	Yeah, and I can kind of agree with that.
3051059	3054581	I still would like to see a little bit more of the interface change.
3054681	3060402	Like, if I'm too far away from an enemy, I don't need a little box in the corner telling me that.
3060442	3061623	I need something on screen.
3062003	3065084	Might be because I'm used to WoW, but that effective...
3067045	3081875	The other thing that I would like to see changed and could probably have helped a lot is the pointer on screen was not very smooth.
3082315	3085758	Like you would move your mouse and then the pointer would move very slowly.
3086398	3089120	Not responsive compared to what you're moving on the mouse.
3089860	3095843	If they can speed that up, get it to a 1 to 1 ratio on your movement speed, it'd probably help a little bit more.
3095883	3103966	But by the time I was able to click on the button to go use my TP, the fight was over, and it kind of sucked.
3104826	3106947	Again, though, I think that's a problem with the demo, not the game.
3108568	3111769	I've heard it's the same for the alpha, but it might still be alpha-related.
3112987	3121171	Well, I will say this, you know, as somebody who sunk a couple years into Final Fantasy XI, conceptually, I really like a lot of the things they did with XIV.
3121211	3134717	Like, I just think I can really see where they've tried to make an effort to have things more solo-able, like with these guild lives, with the different levels of difficulty.
3135398	3138039	I thought that was really cool, and I just, I loved how
3138639	3140260	The quest start was right there.
3140340	3142361	The quest turn in was right there when you finished.
3142741	3144442	Everything was very instant gratification.
3145542	3151705	Those of you that have played XI know it's a lot of walking and running around and slow moving game.
3152105	3155666	It definitely feels like they've kind of picked up the pace a little bit in XIV.
3156227	3159268	Conceptually, I was really a fan of the stuff they implemented that I saw.
3160603	3167407	Another cool thing, because I'm not all boohoo on this game, especially after today we watched the trailer on Rob's TV.
3167687	3170048	And like I told him, I was like, well, this trailer just changed my mind.
3170088	3171289	I'm going to play again.
3171969	3173390	And it was just cut scenes.
3173450	3186617	But another cool thing about the guild leaves is that if you're someone that likes to grind in games and just not read anything, any enemies you have to kill for guild leaves have little guild leave markers next to their name.
3186657	3189959	So you know you can avoid everybody else and just focus on those same enemies.
3191739	3216584	though that does bring me to another thing I forgot to mention is that when we were killing the crabs because that's what we had to do one crab before it died started to run away and those suckers move fast and I could not catch up and part of the way you regain health is you sheath your weapon well you've got to stop to sheath your weapon the animation forces you to so he's still running away I'm trying to sheath my weapon so it stops me he's getting farther ahead and
3217686	3227128	I probably would not have known where to go unless the representative had told me where to go because I lost sight of him.
3228429	3231470	Something to keep in mind though, didn't you want the crabs to run ahead?
3231490	3235291	Because didn't they take you to a room that had the other monsters in it that you needed to kill?
3235391	3236911	It almost seemed like that was part of it.
3237955	3247002	It did seem like it was part of it, but one thing, and I'm not sure because I was one of the people that didn't read the leave at all because it wasn't on my screen.
3248523	3257829	Until we actually got to that room where we had to kill water elementals too, the water elementals did not appear as part of the quest as what I had to kill.
3258270	3264134	It wasn't until I got to that room where their name appeared below my crabs I've killed
3264874	3271596	So, I don't know if that triggered more to the quest, or if it just didn't show up until I got closer to those enemies.
3272937	3273817	Hmm, interesting.
3274437	3278819	Alright, well, let's move on from Final Fantasy XIV and talk about some of the other games we saw.
3278899	3284781	I know Civilization V was another game we had a little time to sit down and have a demo done for us.
3284821	3285581	We didn't get to play it.
3286422	3288502	But it was a really gorgeous game.
3288822	3292164	Of course they had it running on their best system, but you can...
3293894	3294734	The Hexagonal Shift is kind of new.
3294754	3295255	There's a new...
3321605	3337764	thing that they put in there, and I'm terrible, I forgot the name of it, and I should have taped the thing yesterday so I could remember, but they reminded me of like talent trees in Diablo or WoW, where as you put your points in these certain trees, it kind of has this effect on your civilization, which I thought was kind of neat.
3338223	3339644	Thank you for watching!
3356946	3362588	It's not that I don't care for the Civilization series, it's more that I don't do strategy games.
3363228	3368990	I don't have the patience nor the, I'm guessing, brainpower to do them.
3369530	3374312	But I'm glad I watched the Civ 5 demo because it actually looked really interesting.
3375473	3379134	It looked kind of like a SimCity style game, and I know it's not.
3379734	3402164	but there were so many aspects that you can focus on in that game instead of just all out battling it look like that it might be something I give a shot it was funny and like I said with Dead Rising I'm scared of zombies but the game was funny so I'm probably going to play it Civ 5 I'm scared of strategy games but it was funny so I'm probably going to try it alright whatever makes it work huh
3403683	3409165	Alright, I guess the very last game there is to talk about is Puzzle Quest 2!
3410325	3411906	Yeah, I know, we saved the best for last.
3412006	3413206	No, I mean, it was cute.
3414327	3416368	Although, yeah, the main battle is more of the same.
3416548	3417468	But, hey, hold on.
3418410	3420052	There seems to be a lot more mini games.
3420072	3421354	That's one of the first things I noticed.
3421374	3426862	Like, you know, in the original Puzzle Quest, there were games that you would do to, like, take over the cities and all that stuff.
3427403	3433130	It seems like they've built more of those types of games in Puzzle Quest 2, and that's one of the biggest differences I noticed off the bat.
3433411	3435534	And you can play those mini games on demand, which was cool, too.
3436801	3444605	I'm kind of dumb, because I just remembered a really good thing to have tested out on Puzzle Quest 2 was the campaign mode, because I know it was there.
3444625	3446866	I just went to Quick Battle, but yeah, it was more of the same.
3447587	3450128	Graphically, nothing really changed.
3450148	3452749	We played the DS version, just so you know.
3453690	3457652	We had people next to us playing the 361, whatever.
3458872	3462334	Quick Battle was just, you know, pick a character, fight a goblin, win.
3462794	3463875	Except I lost the first one.
3464675	3465375	I won the second one.
3466376	3470237	But I forgot to try the campaign mode because that's the thing that was supposed to be overhauled.
3471598	3472198	So that sucks.
3474019	3475360	Guess we'll have to wait until the full release.
3476020	3476320	Oh well.
3476981	3482483	Alright, so before we wrap up, Shane, I'll ask you kind of the same thing that I asked Bobby and put him on the spot with.
3482563	3484204	What was the thing that most surprised you about E3?
3486329	3488051	Um, this is actually easy.
3488331	3488891	The 3DS.
3489352	3490352	And we all knew it was coming.
3491453	3492394	Didn't know in what form.
3493275	3495577	And, you know, I was one of the skeptical people.
3495637	3497978	I knew I'd buy it regardless because it's Nintendo handheld.
3498018	3498739	You can't go wrong.
3499239	3502242	But I was surprised by the...
3503703	3507628	I don't know how much it really changed some of those games to me.
3508289	3517721	Seeing DJ Hero with the track coming at you was such an interesting idea compared to just seeing it flat, kind of scrolling down the screen.
3519338	3532590	Seeing freaking Nintendogs, you know, not the best of demos, but just kind of seeing that they had this 3D version of it and, you know, being able to see the ball go in the distance and then come back in his mouth.
3532690	3534792	It was just really interesting.
3535853	3539957	I was really surprised by how much I ended up liking that little system.
3542278	3569823	for me probably two things number one I think what most people are probably thinking and surprise them about E3 even sitting at home Microsoft's and Nintendo's switching places this year where Microsoft was totally catering to the casual crowd and Nintendo finally gave I think what a lot of us were bitching about the past two years what we finally wanted yeah Kid Icarus namely you know in the 3DS and just Reggie getting out there and going and here's a game and here's a game and here's a game and now you shut the fuck up about how bad the Wii is
3570219	3596564	that's really what his press conference was it's pretty cool um and you know and then Microsoft just kind of you know really kind of putting all their chips on the casual market so we'll see how it pays off for him I don't know I'm interested in some of the extra gaming I gotta say the exercise gaming or whatever it's called not feeling so much on the casual titles that are coming out for Kinect so we'll see if the gamble pays off and then Sony's just Sony's just kind of doing their thing and you know now Valve's there and now they're gonna have motion and
3597116	3608739	but unfortunately for Sony I don't think there's a whole lot on the motion controller I feel like I have to have I'm not going to buy one because there's nothing I really want to play that needs the motion controller but I will buy LittleBigPlanet 2 that's for damn sure
3610147	3613168	I'd like to comment real quick about the role reversal.
3613728	3619550	This E3, everybody knows that before this E3 it's Microsoft vs. Sony with Nintendo doing their own thing.
3620011	3624472	Now it seems like it's Microsoft vs. Nintendo with Sony doing their own thing.
3624952	3629774	It's very interesting how everything just kind of switched with Microsoft still being like...
3630574	3633695	I'm going to bite off you and not care about these other people.
3634575	3637496	Just like they were doing with Sony to Nintendo and now Nintendo to Sony.
3639037	3648040	And in your comment in regards to the move, I always feel like if I can find one game that I know I will play a lot of for a system or accessory, I will get it.
3648120	3649440	And that will be Time Crisis.
3649860	3653182	That's enough for me to justify at least a move controller.
3653522	3657383	Maybe not the move Balancing Stone or whatever it's called.
3658963	3659423	Oh, we'll see.
3659463	3661024	Maybe there'll be a game that'll change my mind.
3661084	3662225	Maybe it's Sing Star Dance.
3662485	3663806	Who knows, but I somehow doubt it.
3664266	3668749	Alright, the thing that most surprised me otherwise, DC Universe.
3669009	3674533	I was like so, I just was loving that game and it's not, I was really caught by surprise.
3674613	3680997	I thought it was just going to be like another MMO I wouldn't really give a second thought to, although I thought the cross-platform was cool.
3681617	3684258	Um, but yeah, I definitely want to check that game out when it comes out now.
3684718	3687958	But you know what always happens to games we call one of the best of E3.
3687978	3690019	I'm not saying DC Universe is necessarily best of E3.
3690059	3696760	I think that prize would really go to 3DS, but, um, you know, uh, it usually happens with our best of E3 picks.
3697060	3698621	They come out and they're not so great.
3699301	3700781	Remember Nintendogs, anybody?
3701701	3706562	Um, okay, so, Shane, what about the thing that disappointed you the most?
3706662	3709783	Would it be, like, Microsoft, like a lot of people at home are thinking, or...
3711098	3715122	No, I wouldn't say it was Microsoft, because I'm not a huge fan of theirs anyway.
3715162	3719966	I was actually kind of happy with them in terms of their new hardware.
3721127	3726732	Finally getting that wireless adapter built inside instead of having another $100 attachment to pay for.
3727893	3735519	I would say what really disappointed me, this E3, was the lack of playable demos for big games.
3738761	3746802	If you didn't have an appointment, you couldn't play Guitar Hero, you couldn't play DJ Hero 2, you couldn't play the new Call of Duty, you couldn't play anything at Bethesda.
3747743	3751744	Portal 2 wasn't even anywhere in playable form and that's a huge title.
3753924	3757945	There was no announcements for Dragon Age 2, which has already gotten a release date.
3758705	3761966	Thank you Dragon Age Awakening for bundling that in and teasing me.
3764307	3773171	So I was just disappointed at the lack of playable big titles, or even titles that have been previously mentioned and were nowhere on the floor.
3775065	3780309	I'll pretty much agree with what Shane's saying as far as the biggest disappointment, but I'll just sum it up all in one game.
3780690	3791038	The one game I would have really liked to play on the show floor, that Child of Eden game, looked pretty badass, and I really wanted to check that out, and I was extremely disappointed I wouldn't be able to.
3791638	3796922	Also, there was a huge line for Metroid Other M, because it's the one thing in Nintendo I didn't end up playing, because I didn't want to sit in that line.
3797062	3799164	So, I'll just have to check it out when the game comes out.
3800595	3806277	So, you know, we've kind of had 3DS dominate a lot of the conversation we've had over the past couple days.
3806897	3808698	So Shane, I'll give you one more reason to talk about it.
3809058	3811498	When do you think this system is going to come out and how much?
3811799	3812299	Place your bets.
3813459	3814979	Okay, so it's Nintendo.
3815500	3817960	They've never done a system that's been over $300.
3818020	3821721	They've never done a handheld that's been over $200.
3821801	3825042	Actually, $190 I think is the max they've gone with this DSi XL.
3825783	3826523	I will say...
3827878	3832221	I would hope the system comes out at $200 because I don't think they'll go lower than that.
3832801	3838404	But I would expect the system to come out at $250 because of the technology and all the stuff it can do.
3839024	3844567	As for when it comes out, they've already said it'll be by the end of the fiscal year, which will be March 2011.
3846788	3852011	I will say, and it'll be wrong, but I'll say in America we'll get it this holiday.
3852511	3859155	My only reasoning for that is because Nintendo has nothing for this holiday at all.
3859295	3862597	They have nothing to compete with the Move, nothing to compete with Kinect.
3863797	3875624	I think the only real holiday titles they have coming are Donkey Kong, which I don't think is big enough to support the Wii, and Wii Party, which is definitely not big enough to support the Wii this holiday.
3876044	3877785	and then for DS, Golden Sun.
3878705	3882506	And I'm not even sure if that's towards the holiday or if it's just standard fall.
3882987	3887468	So I'm going to go with $250 realistically and this holiday.
3889469	3892670	I'm going to say Nintendo goes all the way to March 2011.
3892750	3894851	Actually, no, I'm going to say February 2011.
3895911	3897472	Maybe they'll do like a Valentine's Day thing.
3897512	3897812	I don't know.
3898508	3899308	I'm going to say February 2011.
3900449	3905291	I will also say $250, but you will get a bundle in game and movie.
3905511	3908853	I think they're going to try to sweeten the pot with some nice bundles.
3909273	3911814	Although the game will not be Kid Icarus, so don't get your hopes up.
3911854	3917717	The game will be something else, and the movie will be one of those Disney things that are being demoed out on the floor.
3917777	3918617	Although, well, maybe not.
3918717	3921819	I guess it might have to be something Nintendo related, but we'll see.
3922119	3923740	I think they'll do that.
3923820	3924360	Or maybe like
3925151	3925831	You know what it'll be?
3925971	3928733	It'll be a bunch of like 3D movie trailers.
3928793	3936556	There'll be like one cartridge that's just like 3D experience and it's gonna be all these movies and things we saw on the show floor just in one cartridge.
3936656	3938737	I bet it'll be that and then like a game.
3940376	3948261	And then I'm saying February 2011, and I'm just going to say Reggie's going to try to push all those Wii titles for the holiday season.
3948361	3955905	I think, I disagree with Shane, I think Wii Party, as much as we don't think is enough to sustain them through their holiday season, I think that's going to be their big holiday push.
3956286	3963010	And then for the hardcore crowd, they're going to be like, hey, you got GoldenEye, and you got Kirby over here, and all this other stuff.
3963210	3965871	So I think, yeah, GoldenEye was this year, right?
3966391	3968793	The demo we played felt really done, so...
3969366	3970566	I would think Goldeneye's maybe this year.
3971726	3976087	I hear that the Zelda demo felt really done too, and that's not until next year.
3976127	3976927	Thanks, Nintendo.
3978348	3983248	Oh, I was going to say, I thought you meant Zelda on the 3DS, and I was going to go, well, there's maybe your pack-in game.
3984829	3987309	That, no, because they can make tons of money off of that.
3987709	3991170	I was thinking maybe Nintendogs, and I'm like, nope, that'll make a ton of money.
3992290	3994890	There's nothing that Nintendo showed that they would pack in.
3995030	3997711	Maybe another Metroid Prime First Hunt or something.
3999474	4001557	Again, I think it's going to be the 3D buffet.
4001657	4004682	It's basically all the demos we saw on one cartridge.
4005584	4007948	I wouldn't put it past them, though, to do Nintendogs plus cats.
4008088	4008448	Why not?
4008509	4009851	They did a Nintendogs bundle before.
4011690	4034863	maybe but I think that was after the game had already come out and it was for like a special Thanksgiving bundle I feel like they could make too much money off that and I didn't think about this but the price of the games I wonder if they'll be higher than the DS or not because they're on new it is a new format it looks like the cartridges do look a little different I have a picture it's not the same of course they'll be more expensive of course
4035984	4037845	About $5 to $10 more expensive.
4039106	4041188	No, I can do $5, I can't do $10.
4041528	4043830	I do not want $50 handheld games.
4044210	4046131	I'm sick of $40 ones already.
4047172	4048333	Alright, let's wrap up.
4049514	4055418	The thing you most want to see at E3 2011, or one thing you want to see changed for E3 2011.
4055698	4058360	What I want to see changed?
4058420	4059501	Not what game I want to see?
4060182	4060442	Either.
4060990	4061610	I'll do both.
4062371	4065272	I want less closed doors.
4066373	4070535	You know, if it's a press event, all the press should be able to see whatever.
4070995	4072276	You shouldn't have to make an appointment.
4072356	4076458	You should have a press-only area, but not an appointment.
4076978	4079079	Second thing I want to see, or game I want to see?
4079640	4080040	Uncharted 3.
4083121	4083761	I don't even know.
4083861	4087725	Next year I want to see them reopen Kensha Hall and not use it as a parking lot.
4087765	4088585	That would be pretty cool.
4089066	4093890	Help thin out the crowds a little bit and give the indies and foreign companies more place to grow.
4093910	4095071	I think it would be really cool.
4095451	4101757	And I would like to see some of the game companies that are too good for booths these days come back.
4102157	4103398	That's what I would like to see happen.
4104159	4105480	And yeah, I'm kind of with Shane.
4106605	4134061	I get the appointment thing though I understand especially with something like 14 I think they should have done that by appointment I think they should have not I think it should have been more like the Civ 5 thing where someone else demoed it but that's just me I get it sometimes so anyway that's it we're going to wrap up and call it a podcast thank you guys for listening to these special podcasts I know the audio quality has been kind of crap compared to the shows I know you guys miss Jamie's Classic Game of the Week and Loki's Rants but don't worry it is all coming back this Sunday night
4134414	4142336	We're going to have DarkSakura and Loki and myself all kind of wrapping up E3 all over again and picking up on some of the other news that happened while the event was going on.
4142416	4143797	So that's going to do it.
4144117	4146117	Thank you so much for tuning in.
4146577	4147137	Tune loading?
4147157	4147978	Did I say tune loading?
4148018	4148658	I think I was about to say it.
4148938	4151238	Tuning in and downloading the little show.
4151499	4153659	Rob Robertson Pals, our E3 specials.
4154219	4156360	See you Sunday night for more Orange Lounge Radio.
4156500	4156800	Goodbye.
