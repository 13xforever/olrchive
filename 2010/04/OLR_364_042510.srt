1
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:19,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Could a new TV station come to an Xbox near you?

2
00:00:19,549 --> 00:00:23,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Some big Wii titles get delayed and a Capcom press event confirms all.

3
00:00:31,437 --> 00:00:39,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello my friends all across the internet and welcome to another episode, episode 364 of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:39,544 --> 00:00:43,428
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the video game program where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:43,928 --> 00:00:57,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Pull up a chair and join us in chat, chat.orangeloungeradio.com as we tape live on this lovely Sunday evening, April the 25th of 2010, right after Bobby Blackwolf has finished his show at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

6
00:00:58,121 --> 00:00:59,062
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard worse over the weekend Yes I am

7
00:01:23,467 --> 00:01:24,047
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing?

8
00:01:24,587 --> 00:01:25,288
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm doing okay.

9
00:01:42,429 --> 00:01:43,210
[SPEAKER_07]: It was alright.

10
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,851
[SPEAKER_07]: It was definitely edible this time.

11
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,354
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just have to say, it's kind of just average.

12
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:51,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, for the cost, you're better off getting pretty much anything else.

13
00:01:52,158 --> 00:01:53,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Even stuff from KFC.

14
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:57,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, I mean, Double Down's like a good, I think, $6.99 or something.

15
00:01:58,704 --> 00:02:02,447
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, hell, you can get a lot more chicken for that.

16
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:03,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Just get a chicken wing.

17
00:02:03,448 --> 00:02:05,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Just get a chicken wing.

18
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:06,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Just keep it old school.

19
00:02:06,671 --> 00:02:07,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Barbecue wings or something like that.

20
00:02:08,472 --> 00:02:09,513
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really where it's at.

21
00:02:09,593 --> 00:02:10,353
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good stuff.

22
00:02:10,853 --> 00:02:11,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't need the mess of the Double Down.

23
00:02:11,994 --> 00:02:15,056
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really just an excuse to sell expensive chicken.

24
00:02:15,456 --> 00:02:16,437
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all it really is.

25
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,539
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, tried it with extra bacon even.

26
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,320
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of okay.

27
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Even extra bacon didn't make it better?

28
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:26,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't really make a difference, really.

29
00:02:26,943 --> 00:02:30,665
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just too much of the white meat chicken flavor.

30
00:02:31,226 --> 00:02:31,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

31
00:02:32,246 --> 00:02:47,530
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to our chat room at chat.orangelandredi.com You know we call them the always present fourth guest on the show Because we don't have any special guests tonight We haven't had a lot of special guests at Studio Dark Sakura I don't know what it is The people I invented to were outside in the front yard racing RC cars Or they were Is that what they're really doing?

32
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:52,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes That's funny I only saw the girls across the street in the Barbie car

33
00:02:52,811 --> 00:02:57,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that was while when you were just here and sitting here wondering what to do.

34
00:02:57,675 --> 00:02:57,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

35
00:02:58,756 --> 00:03:01,218
[SPEAKER_03]: They were outside actually chasing the dog with the RC cars.

36
00:03:02,078 --> 00:03:03,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Will's dog went to the pit bull.

37
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:09,364
[SPEAKER_06]: And just to bring some light to what DarkSakura said while you were sitting here wondering what to do.

38
00:03:09,804 --> 00:03:12,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually I get to the show about an hour early, right?

39
00:03:12,907 --> 00:03:18,091
[SPEAKER_06]: I get here to the show because, you know, I want to set everything up, get the mixing board, the mics, the chairs, everything.

40
00:03:18,271 --> 00:03:19,612
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

41
00:03:42,924 --> 00:03:46,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and she even gave me, what is this, like sweet beer or something, soda beer.

42
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:48,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Shandy, it's a Shandy Bass.

43
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,629
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura's trying to get me drunk.

44
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,570
[SPEAKER_03]: It's beer soda.

45
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,491
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why she's trying to get me drunk.

46
00:03:53,611 --> 00:04:01,136
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little too sweet overall, but it's really good because it tastes just like, it's basically like a lemon soda with a little bit of beer in it.

47
00:04:01,856 --> 00:04:08,220
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we usually start off the show talking about our gaming weeks, but there's some actually really funny personal things I think we have to talk about.

48
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,161
[SPEAKER_06]: And DarkSakura, this cracked me up.

49
00:04:11,442 --> 00:04:14,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Something that you have recently added to YouTube.

50
00:04:14,403 --> 00:04:18,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Give us some background on what's going on here and what happened this past week.

51
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:24,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I went to my friend Becky's son's third birthday party.

52
00:04:25,448 --> 00:04:27,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, okay, first of all, first of all, that morning I went to a bar mitzvah.

53
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:31,250
[SPEAKER_03]: I hadn't eaten anything, so I won't even go into that.

54
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:37,532
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went to Becky's son's birthday party, and he was really cute, and he was wearing like the best shirt ever, which was a t-shirt with a dalek on it.

55
00:04:38,352 --> 00:04:41,393
[SPEAKER_03]: So I actually managed to get some commentary from him.

56
00:04:42,563 --> 00:04:44,683
[SPEAKER_06]: And I love this YouTube more than anything.

57
00:04:45,864 --> 00:04:46,044
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

58
00:04:46,544 --> 00:04:51,565
[SPEAKER_03]: The first thing... The first thing that got cut off is I asked him what was on his shirt.

59
00:04:52,265 --> 00:04:52,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

60
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:55,386
[SPEAKER_06]: So, hey kid, what is on your shirt?

61
00:04:57,566 --> 00:04:58,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Dalek.

62
00:04:59,207 --> 00:05:00,347
[SPEAKER_04]: What does a Dalek say?

63
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,987
[SPEAKER_00]: Stimulate.

64
00:05:07,088 --> 00:05:11,929
[SPEAKER_06]: And my immediate reaction was, DarkSakura, what are you teaching the children?

65
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:13,109
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't teach him that.

66
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,010
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't me.

67
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:14,950
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't do it.

68
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:21,532
[SPEAKER_03]: It was either his mother or his aunt or some relative along that vein.

69
00:05:23,192 --> 00:05:28,053
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you want the chat room shouting, link, link, but I want to give this out so that everybody has it.

70
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:30,214
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just on DarkSakura's personal YouTube, which you've given us.

71
00:05:30,234 --> 00:05:31,174
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakuraOLR.

72
00:05:31,274 --> 00:05:32,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just YouTube.

73
00:05:32,274 --> 00:05:32,434
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

74
00:05:32,494 --> 00:05:35,855
[SPEAKER_06]: YouTube.com slash user slash DarkSakuraOLR.

75
00:05:36,155 --> 00:05:38,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Exterminate Exterminate Exterminate Exterminate

76
00:06:04,466 --> 00:06:07,809
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we have breaking... Okay, Becky, because I'm chatting with Becky.

77
00:06:07,829 --> 00:06:08,490
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

78
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,273
[SPEAKER_03]: She said that he watched Doctor Who with them and seen a Dalek episode.

79
00:06:12,614 --> 00:06:13,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, I see.

80
00:06:13,254 --> 00:06:14,355
[SPEAKER_03]: So he knows what a Dalek is.

81
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:18,119
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, we got some other breaking news live unfolding.

82
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:22,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Breaking news here at the OLR Studio Headquarters.

83
00:06:22,202 --> 00:06:22,783
[SPEAKER_00]: Breaking News

84
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,622
[SPEAKER_06]: We go live over to Techmaster Loki with the special report here.

85
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:33,683
[SPEAKER_06]: What is going on?

86
00:06:33,723 --> 00:06:36,065
[SPEAKER_06]: This is unfolding live, actually, literally.

87
00:06:37,045 --> 00:06:40,208
[SPEAKER_06]: One minute before we went live tonight, we've found something out.

88
00:06:40,248 --> 00:06:41,108
[SPEAKER_06]: What is going on, Loki?

89
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:53,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently one of Jamie's friends messaged me on Facebook by the name of TJ McKimmy and posted a link to a Stockton Craigslist entry

90
00:06:54,238 --> 00:06:57,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess whose number happens to be right there?

91
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the guy that stole my 360 a while back.

92
00:07:00,882 --> 00:07:02,983
[SPEAKER_07]: He's trying to offload a PS3 now.

93
00:07:04,364 --> 00:07:04,724
[SPEAKER_06]: And your money.

94
00:07:05,663 --> 00:07:06,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and my money.

95
00:07:07,364 --> 00:07:23,112
[SPEAKER_06]: So the guy who hacksawed your 360 for real and just ran off with it and never... And if you didn't hear the show about a month ago, long story short, you went out to meet the guy and he was going to do the JTAG thing on your 360 so you could play Espeluda and all that stuff and no more heroes and stuff, right?

96
00:07:23,252 --> 00:07:23,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

97
00:07:23,673 --> 00:07:29,996
[SPEAKER_06]: So he was going to do that to your 360 and he said, you know, come back in a couple hours, which should have been your hint right there, Loki, but you know...

98
00:07:30,756 --> 00:07:31,457
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to nail him.

99
00:07:57,293 --> 00:08:19,141
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, and the chatter's going, call him, call him live on air I am not radio professionally I think there's an issue with doing that when you don't have the person's permission I realize he's the bad guy but I worry it would turn into one of those things where the thief falls through the roof and then sues the owners of the home for the fact that he broke his foot trying to break into the house You know what I mean?

100
00:08:20,462 --> 00:08:23,583
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I can't do anything about it

101
00:08:27,469 --> 00:08:31,291
[SPEAKER_03]: As we look to the person who can do something about it.

102
00:08:31,431 --> 00:08:33,091
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to drive down to Stockton again.

103
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:34,151
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's Stockton.

104
00:08:34,211 --> 00:08:35,232
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just awful.

105
00:08:35,412 --> 00:08:38,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, we don't write the news.

106
00:08:38,473 --> 00:08:39,233
[SPEAKER_07]: We just report it.

107
00:08:39,313 --> 00:08:41,254
[SPEAKER_03]: I say just call Stockton PD.

108
00:08:41,794 --> 00:08:43,955
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be funny, but what are they going to do?

109
00:08:44,055 --> 00:08:48,596
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to be like, well, it's our word versus yours.

110
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:50,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was trying to illegally hack my 360.

111
00:08:52,577 --> 00:08:54,158
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't even matter if that was the case.

112
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:58,298
[SPEAKER_07]: I was having solder work done on my 360s motherboard.

113
00:09:00,099 --> 00:09:04,760
[SPEAKER_06]: And Bobby in chat, because he knows more about radio than I do, says it depends on the state's guy.

114
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Some states only need one side's permission.

115
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:10,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, it's just one of those things where it's like, you know what?

116
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:12,082
[SPEAKER_03]: What about calling Disneyland?

117
00:09:12,222 --> 00:09:13,942
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it would be good radio.

118
00:09:15,002 --> 00:09:16,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember when they called Disneyland?

119
00:09:16,483 --> 00:09:17,183
[SPEAKER_06]: That was harmless.

120
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:17,863
[SPEAKER_06]: That was funny.

121
00:09:18,103 --> 00:09:19,084
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

122
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,721
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what happened there.

123
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:48,541
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very odd.

124
00:10:14,793 --> 00:10:16,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbox guys hacking our network too.

125
00:10:16,734 --> 00:10:21,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's get around 10 minutes into the show finally and we can finally talk about our gaming week.

126
00:10:21,156 --> 00:10:22,517
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

127
00:10:23,518 --> 00:10:24,298
[SPEAKER_03]: It was not.

128
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:27,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, I started playing Babylonian Twins.

129
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:32,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that I finally have gotten my projects out of the way and had a chance to play something, it's really fun.

130
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:33,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, it's really fun.

131
00:10:34,832 --> 00:10:43,837
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's definitely, it's like a puzzle adventure game, it really is, because you do one thing with one brother, and then the other one is a statue.

132
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:51,699
[SPEAKER_03]: So you actually can use him when one's a statue, you can jump off of him and put him on buttons and levers and things.

133
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:55,420
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just, it's really, really fun.

134
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,141
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the best way I can say it, it's just really fun.

135
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:05,322
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've gotten through like the first, I got through the tutorial level just playing around and now I'm actually doing one of the levels for real.

136
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:10,223
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like I said, I've really been busy doing a lot of other projects, but...

137
00:11:13,202 --> 00:11:15,188
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is really fun.

138
00:11:15,249 --> 00:11:15,911
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fun little game.

139
00:11:16,493 --> 00:11:18,499
[SPEAKER_03]: And once I play more, I'm actually going to do a little write-up on it.

140
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:29,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh, our website might actually get some content outside of the... And don't get me wrong, I love that song, but that's about the only new content our website gets besides show updates.

141
00:11:29,685 --> 00:11:30,425
[SPEAKER_06]: So that would be great.

142
00:11:31,145 --> 00:11:31,725
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love that.

143
00:11:32,265 --> 00:11:32,485
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

144
00:11:34,206 --> 00:11:35,086
[SPEAKER_06]: New content for the site.

145
00:11:35,106 --> 00:11:35,886
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be great.

146
00:11:35,926 --> 00:11:36,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.

147
00:11:37,146 --> 00:11:39,307
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we have the I Love That song, but that's it.

148
00:11:40,207 --> 00:11:40,947
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we get it.

149
00:11:41,287 --> 00:11:42,007
[SPEAKER_03]: People love music.

150
00:11:42,027 --> 00:11:44,247
[SPEAKER_03]: My brain was still on the game, so I was like, what?

151
00:11:44,687 --> 00:11:45,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that, yeah.

152
00:11:46,508 --> 00:11:47,468
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I had already forgotten about it.

153
00:11:49,187 --> 00:11:50,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

154
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:55,989
[SPEAKER_07]: It was okay, just playing Grand Theft Auto at work, and that was fun.

155
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:10,693
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, let's see, this weekend I played through some of Just Cause 2, just the beginning, because I have a version of the game that has some of the PC mods on it, so that was kind of fun to play around with.

156
00:12:11,133 --> 00:12:18,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, I don't think I ripped it right because a lot of the textures weren't appearing, so it was kind of hard to play.

157
00:12:18,837 --> 00:12:23,380
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was fun nonetheless, so I re-ripped it, and hopefully it'll work this time.

158
00:12:25,401 --> 00:12:28,502
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course, more Escaluda 2.

159
00:12:28,883 --> 00:12:34,286
[SPEAKER_07]: This time, I went through the Black Label Novice, and that was fun.

160
00:12:34,826 --> 00:12:39,468
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll probably play through the rest of the game later on, just kind of go in one version of the game at a time.

161
00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:40,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

162
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:45,742
[SPEAKER_07]: and what else did I play?

163
00:12:47,203 --> 00:12:49,746
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think I played any Final Fantasy XIII.

164
00:12:51,648 --> 00:12:53,791
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I think that's about it, unfortunately.

165
00:12:55,254 --> 00:12:57,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Star Trek Online Star Trek Online Star Trek Online

166
00:13:16,984 --> 00:13:25,576
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say this though, obviously I've been going through personal stuff with the job change, yada yada, boo hoo for me, but I mean, well actually it's a good thing, but it just takes away from the gaming schedule.

167
00:13:26,137 --> 00:13:31,263
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say this, on the Warcraft front I actually did accomplish quite a bit.

168
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:37,768
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually got one of my new characters, my warrior that I've been leveling with Alan.

169
00:13:37,808 --> 00:13:40,610
[SPEAKER_06]: We got those together to Northrend, which is a big event.

170
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,891
[SPEAKER_06]: We're in the new content, The Wrath of the Lich King.

171
00:13:43,131 --> 00:13:43,932
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will also say this.

172
00:13:44,092 --> 00:13:46,913
[SPEAKER_06]: For the first time, finally, this week, I know I'm a little late.

173
00:13:47,214 --> 00:13:48,655
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not much of a raider usually.

174
00:13:48,675 --> 00:13:50,015
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really run the raids a lot.

175
00:13:50,075 --> 00:13:52,557
[SPEAKER_06]: And wow, I used to about a year ago, but I don't really do it anymore.

176
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,058
[SPEAKER_06]: But this week, just randomly, got asked to go.

177
00:13:55,179 --> 00:13:55,539
[SPEAKER_06]: I went.

178
00:13:56,139 --> 00:14:05,788
[SPEAKER_06]: I ran Ice Crown Citadel, the new, well, new-ish, it's not that new anymore for a WoW player, but a couple months old raid that's basically the end game right now.

179
00:14:05,848 --> 00:14:08,791
[SPEAKER_06]: The Lich King is the boss of Ice Crown Citadel at the very, very end.

180
00:14:09,672 --> 00:14:11,033
[SPEAKER_06]: I was there for a couple hours.

181
00:14:11,173 --> 00:14:12,615
[SPEAKER_06]: We got to the gunship battle.

182
00:14:12,695 --> 00:14:14,056
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to go because I had other commitments.

183
00:14:15,037 --> 00:14:16,438
[SPEAKER_06]: But we fought the first two bosses.

184
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:16,879
[SPEAKER_06]: It was cool.

185
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:20,142
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can finally say I've seen the inside of Ice Crown Citadel.

186
00:14:20,182 --> 00:14:20,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Woo!

187
00:14:21,423 --> 00:14:24,484
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to run it again though because you get reputation just for killing monsters in there.

188
00:14:24,504 --> 00:14:26,665
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get cool rings and stuff.

189
00:14:27,685 --> 00:14:28,665
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was it.

190
00:14:28,705 --> 00:14:31,886
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a pretty Warcraft wonderful week.

191
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:34,787
[SPEAKER_06]: I will try to get back into some of the consoles this week.

192
00:14:34,927 --> 00:14:37,168
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's some stuff for Game Room coming out.

193
00:14:37,228 --> 00:14:39,569
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get to later in the show that I definitely want to get around to.

194
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:43,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Although something that somehow missed the show roll so I'll bring it up now.

195
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:46,751
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard there were layoffs at Chrome this week.

196
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:48,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently the Chrome studio in Australia...

197
00:14:48,872 --> 00:14:52,396
[SPEAKER_06]: had some big layoffs and didn't they make Game Room?

198
00:14:52,816 --> 00:14:53,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

199
00:14:53,397 --> 00:14:55,339
[SPEAKER_06]: So are we screwed?

200
00:14:55,739 --> 00:14:56,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably not.

201
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,586
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they have the emulation already set.

202
00:14:59,646 --> 00:15:02,267
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just putting a ROM with an emulator in place.

203
00:15:02,447 --> 00:15:04,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably not even that, just putting a ROM in place.

204
00:15:04,648 --> 00:15:06,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they do other games too, though, right?

205
00:15:06,228 --> 00:15:07,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they do other stuff.

206
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:18,172
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe this just impacts the other stuff, because I was reading it had nothing to do with Game Room, even though Game Room kind of met with a reception, but that it was more the fact they didn't get the rights to some Wii game they were going to do.

207
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:21,934
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't remember now.

208
00:15:22,534 --> 00:15:25,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody in chat will correct me, but there was some game they were supposed to do

209
00:15:25,475 --> 00:15:25,755
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

210
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Housekeeping Tonight.

211
00:15:45,031 --> 00:15:46,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a lot of show notes.

212
00:15:46,332 --> 00:15:49,314
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe we're still here every week for the foreseeable future.

213
00:15:49,654 --> 00:15:52,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I will say our anniversary show is creeping up on us.

214
00:15:52,476 --> 00:15:56,559
[SPEAKER_06]: And our anniversary show is going to be the 27th, I think, of June.

215
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,421
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

216
00:15:58,441 --> 00:16:04,005
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be the 27th or the 20th of June will be our, what, eight-year anniversary show?

217
00:16:04,645 --> 00:16:04,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeez.

218
00:16:05,325 --> 00:16:05,845
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, right?

219
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:08,206
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's in about eight weeks.

220
00:16:08,686 --> 00:16:10,346
[SPEAKER_06]: And Memorial Day is coming up.

221
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,106
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're still all here for Memorial Day.

222
00:16:12,606 --> 00:16:12,926
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think.

223
00:16:12,966 --> 00:16:14,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Is anyone going out of town for Memorial Day?

224
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:15,407
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

225
00:16:15,647 --> 00:16:17,067
[SPEAKER_06]: And we still have a show on Memorial Day.

226
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:17,987
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

227
00:16:19,248 --> 00:16:20,448
[SPEAKER_06]: No Fonamay this year again.

228
00:16:20,748 --> 00:16:21,708
[SPEAKER_03]: I might be going, actually.

229
00:16:21,788 --> 00:16:22,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to go?

230
00:16:22,908 --> 00:16:23,328
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

231
00:16:23,388 --> 00:16:23,828
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends.

232
00:16:23,968 --> 00:16:25,409
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to go and just kind of drop in.

233
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:28,329
[SPEAKER_06]: But we keep forgetting to like, oh, yeah, we should like try to get a panel.

234
00:16:29,109 --> 00:16:30,890
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's got to be set in stone by now.

235
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,150
[SPEAKER_06]: So we missed out on that one.

236
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

237
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:35,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe go just to say hey.

238
00:16:35,872 --> 00:16:36,192
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

239
00:16:36,593 --> 00:16:36,873
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

240
00:16:37,994 --> 00:16:40,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that many people come and see us at panels anyways.

241
00:16:41,116 --> 00:16:41,776
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had fun.

242
00:16:41,796 --> 00:16:42,977
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always fun.

243
00:16:43,057 --> 00:16:43,377
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fun.

244
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:44,018
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

245
00:16:44,138 --> 00:16:48,781
[SPEAKER_06]: More people came out of Fonamade than some of the other places I've gone to do panels.

246
00:16:49,161 --> 00:16:53,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, sometimes when you have panels at 7 in the morning, it's not difficult to get a crowd.

247
00:16:53,644 --> 00:16:54,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, that was fun.

248
00:16:55,025 --> 00:16:56,906
[SPEAKER_06]: That one kid who showed up had a good time.

249
00:16:56,926 --> 00:16:59,708
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, what the hell are we doing here?

250
00:16:59,928 --> 00:17:00,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously.

251
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:02,430
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

252
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Why'd I wake up early for this?

253
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you say that I've done a little bit of cleaning in here?

254
00:17:06,953 --> 00:17:07,353
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit?

255
00:17:07,513 --> 00:17:08,014
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit.

256
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:12,257
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've started the... Your bookshelf looks a lot nicer than it used to.

257
00:17:12,397 --> 00:17:13,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Massive... It really does.

258
00:17:13,598 --> 00:17:15,819
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been starting the massive task of organizing this room.

259
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

260
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:16,820
Ugh.

261
00:17:17,721 --> 00:17:17,981
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

262
00:17:18,021 --> 00:17:19,342
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm putting pictures on the thing.

263
00:17:20,523 --> 00:17:24,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Ray Ayanami in chat says, there aren't any OLR fans at Fonamay anyway.

264
00:17:24,146 --> 00:17:24,706
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a few.

265
00:17:24,746 --> 00:17:28,269
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the one guy who every year we're there asks Loki some Mac question.

266
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:29,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, why are you such a Mac hater?

267
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,631
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some kid every year.

268
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:32,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of you.

269
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:33,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of you.

270
00:17:35,663 --> 00:17:37,244
[SPEAKER_06]: That should be your response next year.

271
00:17:37,744 --> 00:17:38,045
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

272
00:17:38,805 --> 00:17:48,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Because of stupid design decisions, like, for example, iTunes doesn't work with Windows XP 64-bit for no reason whatsoever other than we want to be douchebags.

273
00:17:48,992 --> 00:17:50,453
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, Windows 7 64-bit?

274
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:52,454
[SPEAKER_00]: No, Windows XP 64-bit.

275
00:17:52,494 --> 00:17:52,935
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it does.

276
00:17:53,835 --> 00:17:54,736
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it does not.

277
00:17:56,197 --> 00:17:57,077
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it does not.

278
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:57,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Trust me.

279
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,861
[SPEAKER_03]: I have experience.

280
00:18:01,101 --> 00:18:02,481
[SPEAKER_07]: It will not let you install it.

281
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:04,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, there's an XP 64-bit?

282
00:18:05,102 --> 00:18:05,922
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even know that.

283
00:18:06,462 --> 00:18:08,042
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's Windows 7 64-bit.

284
00:18:08,062 --> 00:18:08,883
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I run now.

285
00:18:10,003 --> 00:18:10,823
[SPEAKER_06]: But, alright.

286
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:14,364
[SPEAKER_07]: It does not support it for no reason other than Mac is retarded.

287
00:18:15,484 --> 00:18:16,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're not a designer, so.

288
00:18:17,485 --> 00:18:22,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, can we please get on to gaming news and not the PC Mac Wars again?

289
00:18:22,966 --> 00:18:23,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesus.

290
00:18:23,726 --> 00:18:25,927
[SPEAKER_03]: I put up the pictures on my bookshelf since it's awesome.

291
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Gaming News, Loki

292
00:18:41,824 --> 00:18:46,308
[SPEAKER_07]: Microsoft to possibly launch an Xbox Live television channel.

293
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:52,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, this isn't necessarily going to be a channel that we see on TV focused around the Xbox.

294
00:18:52,953 --> 00:18:55,756
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually going to be something that's going to appear on Xbox Live.

295
00:18:55,796 --> 00:19:02,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, during an April 12th meeting at Microsoft's Reverend Washington office,

296
00:19:03,682 --> 00:19:16,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Chairman proposed a channel native to the Xbox 360 that would feature reruns and original shows for an additional $1-$2 per month on top of the standard Xbox Live subscription fee.

297
00:19:18,895 --> 00:19:45,028
[SPEAKER_07]: and so it's basically Peter is talking to lots of people about lots of ideas in the digital space and of course Microsoft is not commenting on it but it kind of fits with the rumor that we had last week that apparently Conan was in talks with possibly Microsoft for doing his show on Xbox Live it's kind of interesting

298
00:19:47,284 --> 00:19:48,385
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it is.

299
00:20:06,661 --> 00:20:07,241
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

300
00:20:07,802 --> 00:20:08,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's very risky.

301
00:20:08,682 --> 00:20:11,604
[SPEAKER_06]: What were the realistic chances of Conan going to Xbox Live anyway?

302
00:20:11,904 --> 00:20:14,946
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very risky being that it's not established yet.

303
00:20:14,986 --> 00:20:17,167
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't know what kind of benefits and stuff.

304
00:20:17,207 --> 00:20:20,349
[SPEAKER_07]: And if the whole thing flopped, then it would be a wasted opportunity.

305
00:20:21,069 --> 00:20:25,652
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a more safe bet for him to go to TUS.

306
00:20:26,232 --> 00:20:27,433
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, if...

307
00:20:32,176 --> 00:20:36,859
[SPEAKER_06]: If Netflix and all that works on Xbox, then why can't this?

308
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:39,300
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this would be a good idea.

309
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,002
[SPEAKER_07]: It just depends on the amount of content that's on here.

310
00:20:43,022 --> 00:20:57,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Because a lot of people nowadays with cable and satellite bills getting higher and higher, if this is only going to be the equivalent of possibly $12 to $24 a year and the content's good, a lot of people would probably jump on that.

311
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:01,362
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I would if it's got some good shows on there.

312
00:21:01,662 --> 00:21:05,565
[SPEAKER_07]: And even just shows that are on normal cable TV or something like that.

313
00:21:05,885 --> 00:21:06,905
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be all for that.

314
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:18,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Wouldn't that be ironic though if you were getting your television through cable but it's your cable internet that you're getting your TV through because your Xbox is actually your cable provider?

315
00:21:18,973 --> 00:21:23,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thanks to the FCC and Comcast and stuff like that, I'm sure that

316
00:21:26,441 --> 00:21:35,348
[SPEAKER_07]: since now they're trying to not pass those laws and stuff that they'll be able to filter it out.

317
00:21:35,408 --> 00:21:35,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Comcast.

318
00:21:36,048 --> 00:21:39,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you want to get TV through our cable internet?

319
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:39,892
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

320
00:21:40,112 --> 00:21:40,832
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

321
00:21:41,032 --> 00:21:41,733
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not going to happen.

322
00:21:41,893 --> 00:21:43,314
[SPEAKER_06]: I really hope that doesn't stick.

323
00:21:43,995 --> 00:21:51,821
[SPEAKER_06]: I think something's going to happen where that's going to... The minute those little loopholes get exposed, that stuff's going to get revoked plain quickly.

324
00:21:52,221 --> 00:21:54,303
[SPEAKER_06]: But hopefully it's not just wishful thinking.

325
00:21:54,503 --> 00:21:55,284
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be really sad.

326
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:00,041
[SPEAKER_06]: But maybe it'll go a long way in trying to get some competitors to Comcast.

327
00:22:00,061 --> 00:22:01,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Like people will come back to them?

328
00:22:02,081 --> 00:22:02,741
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think so.

329
00:22:05,162 --> 00:22:10,263
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as the Xbox channel goes, though, I remember last week we kind of had a discussion.

330
00:22:10,283 --> 00:22:16,664
[SPEAKER_06]: I had brought up the PlayStation Tester and all that stuff, and you said something like you didn't really want to watch the Tester because you thought it was going to be a big commercial for Sony.

331
00:22:17,144 --> 00:22:20,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, wouldn't an Xbox Network be a big commercial for Microsoft?

332
00:22:20,685 --> 00:22:22,465
[SPEAKER_07]: It all depends on what content's on there.

333
00:22:25,086 --> 00:22:25,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the thing.

334
00:22:25,687 --> 00:22:31,610
[SPEAKER_07]: The tester where the prize is becoming a Sony PlayStation tester.

335
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:32,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

336
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:36,633
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, of course, it's going to be focusing on a lot of the games that Sony has.

337
00:22:36,993 --> 00:22:40,175
[SPEAKER_07]: And people are like, oh my god, I'm so excited to play the next big Sony game coming out.

338
00:22:40,255 --> 00:22:41,716
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's retarded.

339
00:22:41,856 --> 00:22:48,660
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, if there was something like that on the Xbox TV channel, I wouldn't want to watch it either because it would just be a waste of my time.

340
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,561
[SPEAKER_07]: It would still be a damn commercial for something.

341
00:22:51,241 --> 00:22:59,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if they had something that was, you know, mainstream, like something that's on TV, for example, that might be, you know, that's different.

342
00:22:59,308 --> 00:23:04,893
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if they had like episodes of The Office or something like that playing on there or just whatever.

343
00:23:04,913 --> 00:23:06,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but I can get The Office signing onto Netflix.

344
00:23:07,336 --> 00:23:07,876
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

345
00:23:08,837 --> 00:23:09,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't have Netflix.

346
00:23:10,979 --> 00:23:11,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

347
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,640
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess you got me there.

348
00:23:12,821 --> 00:23:14,702
[SPEAKER_06]: But Netflix is so cheap.

349
00:23:15,443 --> 00:23:16,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it a dollar a month cheap?

350
00:23:17,243 --> 00:23:18,203
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not that cheap.

351
00:23:18,243 --> 00:23:18,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, see?

352
00:23:19,003 --> 00:23:20,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

353
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:23,144
[SPEAKER_06]: But you'd have to pay for this TV thing too, right?

354
00:23:23,244 --> 00:23:24,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that what they were talking about?

355
00:23:24,245 --> 00:23:26,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, like an extra dollar or two a month.

356
00:23:26,425 --> 00:23:27,505
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what they're looking to charge.

357
00:23:27,765 --> 00:23:28,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's not that bad.

358
00:23:28,906 --> 00:23:31,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Would I have to pay that Microsoft phony points?

359
00:23:31,446 --> 00:23:32,126
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think so.

360
00:23:32,266 --> 00:23:32,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably not.

361
00:23:33,267 --> 00:23:34,047
[SPEAKER_06]: That might be interesting.

362
00:23:34,687 --> 00:23:38,488
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be interesting if it wouldn't be just... Because, you know, we talk about Xbox, Xbox, Xbox.

363
00:23:38,828 --> 00:23:44,629
[SPEAKER_06]: But why wouldn't... I mean, if Microsoft's going to launch a TV station, why wouldn't it be available on your computer?

364
00:23:45,473 --> 00:23:47,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Why wouldn't it be available on your Windows mobile phone?

365
00:23:48,676 --> 00:23:49,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Something to compete with the iPhone.

366
00:23:49,877 --> 00:23:52,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, who says it's not?

367
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,703
[SPEAKER_06]: I would think that an Xbox network is not really an Xbox network.

368
00:23:55,763 --> 00:23:57,985
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a Microsoft network.

369
00:23:58,857 --> 00:24:18,269
[SPEAKER_06]: well doesn't I mean they have MSNBC maybe streaming stuff from that I don't know I think the MSNBC agreement's a little funky I think it's a little more NBC than it is MS at this point but I don't know I don't know the ins and outs of how all that works so I guess I should stop trying to sound like an expert and move on to another story

370
00:24:19,693 --> 00:24:34,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about the PlayStation 3 since we've had a little bit of Xbox news and talk about PlayStation 3 and there is some feathers being ruffled on the PlayStation 3 this week and it has to do with the game Final Fight Double Impact or as I call it Magic Sword Double Impact.

371
00:24:35,761 --> 00:24:43,445
[SPEAKER_06]: You see what's happened is that this game will just not run unless you are signed in online on your PlayStation Network account.

372
00:24:44,145 --> 00:24:49,608
[SPEAKER_06]: If you try to load the game and you're not signed in, you're just going to get a message that says you need to sign into the PlayStation Network.

373
00:24:50,327 --> 00:25:00,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, I know a lot of people, myself included, it doesn't really matter because with the PS3s having the wireless, you know, internet built in and everything, I'm pretty much always connected to PlayStation Network.

374
00:25:00,641 --> 00:25:04,707
[SPEAKER_06]: There's very little time I'm not playing the PS3 and I'm not online.

375
00:25:06,369 --> 00:25:06,630
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

376
00:25:07,811 --> 00:25:15,020
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, what if my internet went down and I wanted to play a video game, which I do a lot when my internet goes down to kind of pass the time.

377
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,264
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if I can't play WoW, I guess I'll go play Xbox or PSN.

378
00:25:19,004 --> 00:25:22,448
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, this thing's kind of weird.

379
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:25,392
[SPEAKER_06]: This is no better than the Ubisoft thing, in my opinion.

380
00:25:25,592 --> 00:25:30,855
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's not... You have to understand why they're doing it in the first place.

381
00:25:31,095 --> 00:25:36,579
[SPEAKER_07]: They're doing it because Sony has this thing, and it's kind of a loophole, basically.

382
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:48,265
[SPEAKER_07]: They had a thing where if you download a title, say you buy whatever, you know, a game, Flower, or something like that, you can repurchase or redownload Flower onto five different systems.

383
00:25:48,926 --> 00:25:54,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Say your system dies or whatever, instead of having to, you know, change your...

384
00:25:56,034 --> 00:25:56,634
[SPEAKER_07]: and so on.

385
00:26:21,869 --> 00:26:29,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Capcom apparently wanted to try something because they didn't like the fact that they're losing out on 80% of their sales potentially.

386
00:26:30,032 --> 00:26:33,533
[SPEAKER_07]: So what they're doing now is they're limiting that to one person now.

387
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:36,714
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have to be the person that bought it in order to play the game.

388
00:26:37,114 --> 00:26:46,477
[SPEAKER_07]: So not only are they making you be online, they are also limiting the fact that you can't share this or re-download it again unless you're the person that used it.

389
00:26:46,917 --> 00:26:52,399
[SPEAKER_07]: And if it turns out to be a success, this is going to be something that's going on with all their titles going forward.

390
00:26:52,639 --> 00:26:57,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what's also interesting about this, Capcom actually issued somewhat of an apology later in the week.

391
00:26:57,701 --> 00:27:01,982
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple days after this news hit, Capcom actually sent out a statement saying,

392
00:27:02,142 --> 00:27:25,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Capcom would like to formally apologize for the issues consumers are having with the PS3 version of Final Fight Double Impact Typically, the notification for a required PlayStation Network connection appears in the full game description when a game is downloaded from the PlayStation Store Unfortunately, when populating this content, this detail was overlooked and wasn't included in the versions of the game that released in North America and Asia It was included in the release for Europe

393
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:32,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Capcom should have checked to make sure the notification was included when the final game was made available, and we sincerely apologize for this oversight.

394
00:27:33,409 --> 00:27:36,373
[SPEAKER_06]: The DRM requirements for Final Fight Double Impact are not unique to this release.

395
00:27:36,673 --> 00:27:40,958
[SPEAKER_06]: This protection mechanism has been implemented in numerous games offered on the PlayStation Store before.

396
00:27:41,414 --> 00:27:41,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Which ones?

397
00:27:42,634 --> 00:27:43,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't know.

398
00:27:43,275 --> 00:27:43,695
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

399
00:27:44,315 --> 00:27:51,157
[SPEAKER_06]: When it was brought to our attention and the notification was missing, we acted quickly with Sony Computer Entertainment America and a fix is on the way!

400
00:27:51,537 --> 00:27:51,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

401
00:27:51,977 --> 00:27:52,917
[SPEAKER_06]: They're gonna fix it!

402
00:27:53,057 --> 00:27:53,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait a minute.

403
00:27:54,198 --> 00:27:56,098
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not really gonna fix the DRM, are they?

404
00:27:56,158 --> 00:27:57,919
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just gonna fix the description.

405
00:27:58,659 --> 00:27:59,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably.

406
00:27:59,179 --> 00:27:59,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't!

407
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:02,340
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the hidden subtext there.

408
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:08,962
[SPEAKER_06]: We would like to thank our vigilant fans for bringing this to our attention and we will exercise better scrutiny on future Capcom releases.

409
00:28:09,042 --> 00:28:10,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Next time we might use some lube.

410
00:28:14,164 --> 00:28:15,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, here's the thing.

411
00:28:16,305 --> 00:28:23,368
[SPEAKER_07]: It sucks that you have to be online and yeah, okay, it will suck that you won't be able to play Final Fight if your internet goes out.

412
00:28:24,128 --> 00:28:24,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Big deal.

413
00:28:25,128 --> 00:28:25,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Play something else.

414
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:29,130
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, seriously, that can't be the only game you're playing.

415
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:40,914
[SPEAKER_07]: and finally, I mean, really the whole reason they're doing this is because people are exploiting a feature in the PlayStation 3 that's really meant for if your system craps out so you can re-download your content.

416
00:28:41,394 --> 00:28:44,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you really want that to be removed later on?

417
00:28:44,195 --> 00:28:47,316
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, because you have people complaining about it and then your console dies.

418
00:28:47,456 --> 00:28:47,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, guess what?

419
00:28:47,816 --> 00:28:49,196
[SPEAKER_07]: You gotta download everything again.

420
00:28:49,316 --> 00:28:50,857
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you have to re-buy everything again.

421
00:28:51,994 --> 00:28:53,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Hackers of America, break me

422
00:29:19,577 --> 00:29:23,258
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same type of logic that you apply to children.

423
00:29:23,298 --> 00:29:24,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell them they can't do something.

424
00:29:24,479 --> 00:29:25,179
[SPEAKER_03]: What do they want to do?

425
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:26,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it.

426
00:29:26,259 --> 00:29:32,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't they just send a fancy wedding invitation on the fancy paper that says you are cordially invited to hack the fuck out of this game?

427
00:29:34,202 --> 00:29:37,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Because people can't really hack the PlayStation Network right now.

428
00:29:37,623 --> 00:29:38,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now?

429
00:29:38,603 --> 00:29:40,283
[SPEAKER_06]: This is because they took the Linux out.

430
00:29:41,584 --> 00:29:42,284
[SPEAKER_06]: But they'll be back.

431
00:29:42,304 --> 00:29:45,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm booting whoever this recruit is in chat room.

432
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:47,286
[SPEAKER_03]: New rule.

433
00:29:47,406 --> 00:29:48,346
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to have a nickname.

434
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:57,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you would have to have one if you want me to read your name, because otherwise there's nothing to read when you guys make lovely chat comments.

435
00:29:59,096 --> 00:29:59,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie's on the warpath.

436
00:29:59,956 --> 00:30:03,198
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting sick of people who just come in and ghost.

437
00:30:03,358 --> 00:30:06,240
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to ghost, make I am a ghost for your nickname.

438
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,061
[SPEAKER_03]: But otherwise, don't just be there.

439
00:30:10,762 --> 00:30:11,763
[SPEAKER_03]: They could be a spy.

440
00:30:12,263 --> 00:30:13,443
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not a spy.

441
00:30:13,544 --> 00:30:13,964
[SPEAKER_03]: They are.

442
00:30:14,004 --> 00:30:14,644
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kicking them.

443
00:30:15,024 --> 00:30:18,106
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going to stop a spy from just saying I'm a normal person?

444
00:30:19,126 --> 00:30:19,967
[SPEAKER_03]: They gave themselves a name.

445
00:30:20,387 --> 00:30:23,649
[SPEAKER_06]: God, that's... Aw, and right as soon as they gave themselves a name, they got kicked.

446
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:25,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Aw.

447
00:30:25,371 --> 00:30:26,211
[SPEAKER_06]: See, you guys are mean.

448
00:30:26,612 --> 00:30:26,872
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

449
00:30:27,612 --> 00:30:28,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Chat.OrganizeRadio.com.

450
00:30:28,853 --> 00:30:30,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Some actual comments from chat.

451
00:30:30,354 --> 00:30:35,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Bochikawa, whether or not they want to get more sales still makes a hassle for the regular legitimate user.

452
00:30:35,578 --> 00:30:37,940
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to cost some sales from people not liking the hassle.

453
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,622
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Loki, not everybody's home is wired to be on the internet all the time.

454
00:30:41,642 --> 00:30:42,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Then how are you going to...

455
00:30:42,483 --> 00:30:43,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Download the damn game.

456
00:30:43,464 --> 00:30:45,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, not wired to be on the internet the whole time.

457
00:30:46,106 --> 00:30:52,050
[SPEAKER_07]: What possible situation would you have other than your internet going out that you would not be on the internet?

458
00:30:52,591 --> 00:30:54,732
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't dial up and download games.

459
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:56,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe not everybody has wireless internet in their house.

460
00:30:56,934 --> 00:31:00,216
[SPEAKER_06]: So they actually run a wire when they want to download something, then they pull the wire when they're done.

461
00:31:00,897 --> 00:31:02,998
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're going to have to run that wire every time they want to play the game.

462
00:31:03,198 --> 00:31:04,459
[SPEAKER_06]: All the way in the kid's bedroom or something.

463
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:05,760
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

464
00:31:06,101 --> 00:31:08,102
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think Final Fight's a really good kid's game.

465
00:31:08,362 --> 00:31:08,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you...

466
00:31:09,683 --> 00:31:16,208
[SPEAKER_06]: When I say kid, it could be a 15, 16 year old where, you know, if I had a 16 year old, I wouldn't care if he was playing Final Fight.

467
00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:17,549
[SPEAKER_06]: I could think of worse games.

468
00:31:19,031 --> 00:31:24,535
[SPEAKER_07]: If they really are out of shape, I'm sure they have, you know, a computer.

469
00:31:24,615 --> 00:31:26,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Download MAME, download the ROM, done.

470
00:31:27,057 --> 00:31:27,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at that.

471
00:31:27,577 --> 00:31:30,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't even have to be connected to the internet and it doesn't cost you anything.

472
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:34,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Frisbee says, and what incentive does paying for DRM infective programs give?

473
00:31:36,897 --> 00:31:41,260
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the subtext I'm reading there is that when you know this is the case, you should just not buy it.

474
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Or buy it on their system.

475
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:44,202
[SPEAKER_06]: I did buy it on Xbox.

476
00:31:44,242 --> 00:31:45,443
[SPEAKER_06]: I had no idea this is the case.

477
00:31:45,483 --> 00:31:51,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently a lot of people bought it on Xbox because this took a few days to come out, the news, which maybe says something right there.

478
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:51,887
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

479
00:31:52,847 --> 00:32:00,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Regardless, we're going to see the DRM mania continue for the next few years, I'm sure, as we get into the next system.

480
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:02,494
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds like a Photoshop to me.

481
00:32:02,594 --> 00:32:04,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Just take drum mania and remove the U out of it.

482
00:32:06,287 --> 00:32:07,588
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking the same thing.

483
00:32:08,569 --> 00:32:11,490
[SPEAKER_06]: What if the only thing you can find is a percussion freaks machine?

484
00:32:12,311 --> 00:32:13,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you're not looking hard enough.

485
00:32:14,052 --> 00:32:15,193
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what you got for us?

486
00:32:15,393 --> 00:32:15,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Good news!

487
00:32:17,854 --> 00:32:18,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

488
00:32:20,516 --> 00:32:25,019
[SPEAKER_03]: They've released the poster art and there's already speculation as to who is going to be in the game.

489
00:32:25,999 --> 00:32:29,781
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it goes without saying that everything we said last week, yeah, it happened.

490
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:30,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

491
00:32:30,261 --> 00:32:30,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it happened.

492
00:32:31,462 --> 00:32:43,627
[SPEAKER_03]: So, of course, for the confirmed characters, we have Morgan, Chris Redfield, Wolverine, Hulk, Ryu, and Iron Man.

493
00:32:43,747 --> 00:32:45,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Chris Redfield the Jill Sandwich guy?

494
00:32:47,137 --> 00:32:49,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Shermie's trying to get out.

495
00:32:49,379 --> 00:32:52,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, from Resident Evil.

496
00:32:52,821 --> 00:32:53,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Him versus the Hulk.

497
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:56,244
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised he hasn't been stepped on and just gone squish.

498
00:32:56,704 --> 00:33:01,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the little trailer they put up was pretty freaking cool.

499
00:33:01,788 --> 00:33:02,969
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you think of the art style in it?

500
00:33:03,989 --> 00:33:04,370
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked it.

501
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:07,872
[SPEAKER_03]: It totally actually made me think of Street Fighter 4.

502
00:33:08,272 --> 00:33:09,493
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard some mixed things on it.

503
00:33:09,533 --> 00:33:12,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Not everybody I've talked to was a fan of the art style in the trailer.

504
00:33:12,415 --> 00:33:13,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they can suck it.

505
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:15,838
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like Tatsunoko versus Capcom if you ask me.

506
00:33:17,142 --> 00:33:25,645
[SPEAKER_03]: At any rate, the speculation on who the other characters are, and a lot of these I actually... Although I have a few speculations of my own from this.

507
00:33:26,945 --> 00:33:33,968
[SPEAKER_03]: They're showing Felicia, Super Skrull, Captain America, Doctor Doom, although...

508
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:36,450
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sort of thinking Taskmaster, maybe.

509
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:39,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, Deadpool, of course, duh.

510
00:33:39,692 --> 00:33:40,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Chun-Li, who cares?

511
00:33:41,413 --> 00:33:42,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Question mark person.

512
00:33:42,214 --> 00:33:42,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I care.

513
00:33:42,674 --> 00:33:43,215
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Chun-Li.

514
00:33:43,615 --> 00:33:45,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yay, question mark person.

515
00:33:45,796 --> 00:33:48,699
[SPEAKER_03]: I just happened to be looking and they haven't identified that person yet.

516
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,822
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one back there that could be Iron Fist, Black Widow, or someone else.

517
00:33:54,123 --> 00:33:55,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Dante and Frank West.

518
00:33:56,738 --> 00:34:00,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck yes to Frank West Hell yes

519
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:29,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Dormammu was in it.

520
00:34:29,831 --> 00:34:32,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're saying Mephisto got crossed out.

521
00:34:32,292 --> 00:34:32,972
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's funny.

522
00:34:34,552 --> 00:34:35,933
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I don't care.

523
00:34:35,953 --> 00:34:36,453
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want it.

524
00:34:37,233 --> 00:34:38,833
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're just going to play Deadpool all day.

525
00:34:39,014 --> 00:34:40,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just Deadpool all day long.

526
00:34:41,074 --> 00:34:42,535
[SPEAKER_03]: He has to talk the whole time, though.

527
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:47,176
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not Deadpool if he does not talk your ass off the entire game.

528
00:34:47,196 --> 00:34:49,257
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're going to have to pay his voice actor a lot.

529
00:34:50,197 --> 00:34:50,797
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see what happens.

530
00:34:50,817 --> 00:34:53,998
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also want the guy to do the voice actor who does Deadpool in Friends.

531
00:34:54,508 --> 00:34:58,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, there was some reaction in our chat room to you going over those names.

532
00:34:58,391 --> 00:35:01,514
[SPEAKER_06]: We had Actdeft yelled out, Deadpool!

533
00:35:02,275 --> 00:35:04,977
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Wyland followed that up by saying, Bea Arthur!

534
00:35:06,138 --> 00:35:10,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I don't remember what Capcom game Bea Arthur was in.

535
00:35:10,282 --> 00:35:11,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Was there a Golden Girls game?

536
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,284
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I have to explain this.

537
00:35:13,485 --> 00:35:18,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Deadpool has or had a major obsession with Bea Arthur.

538
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:20,431
[SPEAKER_06]: And who doesn't?

539
00:35:21,608 --> 00:35:21,989
[SPEAKER_03]: B. Arthur

540
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:42,867
[SPEAKER_06]: I never knew that.

541
00:35:42,947 --> 00:35:45,188
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I only, you know, I don't really read comics.

542
00:35:45,228 --> 00:35:46,028
[SPEAKER_06]: That's no secret.

543
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:47,329
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I just, I just don't.

544
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:53,072
[SPEAKER_06]: But I liked the character in the, what, Iron Man movie when Ryan Reynolds played Deadpool?

545
00:35:53,232 --> 00:35:53,973
[SPEAKER_03]: He played Wade.

546
00:35:54,113 --> 00:35:55,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he was, well, he was funny.

547
00:35:55,974 --> 00:35:56,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

548
00:35:56,194 --> 00:35:56,654
[SPEAKER_06]: And lulled.

549
00:35:57,875 --> 00:36:04,239
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much the type of nonstop talking your ear off I want to hear except, you know, more nuts because he is crazy.

550
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:11,643
[SPEAKER_06]: So sadly, they weren't talking about any type of like actual Bea Arthur being in the game.

551
00:36:12,051 --> 00:36:18,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they're bringing a Deadpool, and of course, Deadpool has to be followed by Bea Arthur, and someone hasn't said Chimichangas.

552
00:36:18,778 --> 00:36:22,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Why wasn't there a Golden Girls video game, actually?

553
00:36:22,282 --> 00:36:27,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you imagine, like, firing up, you know, PlayStation Network, you know, and hopefully the DRM, you guys can still play the game.

554
00:36:27,086 --> 00:36:28,408
[SPEAKER_06]: The Cheesecake is a Lie!

555
00:36:28,508 --> 00:36:33,573
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, and then, you know, you just turn it on, and then... The Cheesecake is a Lie!

556
00:36:34,174 --> 00:36:35,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for being

557
00:36:40,569 --> 00:36:43,114
[SPEAKER_06]: What exactly would you do in the Golden Girls video game?

558
00:36:43,756 --> 00:36:44,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Eat cheesecake?

559
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:45,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Blanche would be a hoe.

560
00:36:47,223 --> 00:36:48,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Sophia would be angry.

561
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,690
[SPEAKER_03]: She'd have her anger snark meter.

562
00:36:52,503 --> 00:36:52,823
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

563
00:36:52,923 --> 00:36:54,844
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to see this as an XNA game.

564
00:36:55,124 --> 00:36:59,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I realize you can't do a Golden Girls XNA game because copyright, IP, da-da-da-da-da.

565
00:36:59,925 --> 00:37:04,626
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's no reason you couldn't do a senior... Silver Ladies.

566
00:37:04,666 --> 00:37:05,887
[SPEAKER_06]: The Silver Ladies.

567
00:37:05,927 --> 00:37:09,748
[SPEAKER_06]: The Silver Ladies, you know, adventure game or something.

568
00:37:09,768 --> 00:37:15,089
[SPEAKER_03]: I always thought it was funny that Estelle Getty played Bea Arthur's character's mom, yet she was younger.

569
00:37:15,969 --> 00:37:16,869
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what they call makeup.

570
00:37:17,089 --> 00:37:17,890
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Estelle Getty.

571
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:18,610
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

572
00:37:19,502 --> 00:37:20,242
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Bea Arthur too.

573
00:37:20,262 --> 00:37:21,042
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to watch Mod.

574
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:22,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Reruns of Mod.

575
00:37:22,963 --> 00:37:23,643
[SPEAKER_03]: I love them both.

576
00:37:23,683 --> 00:37:24,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Rest in peace.

577
00:37:25,624 --> 00:37:27,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Betty White hosting Saturday Night Live next week, by the way.

578
00:37:28,664 --> 00:37:29,224
[SPEAKER_06]: No, May 8th.

579
00:37:29,464 --> 00:37:31,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Betty White doing a roast.

580
00:37:31,585 --> 00:37:32,225
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw her.

581
00:37:33,465 --> 00:37:34,426
[SPEAKER_03]: It was something else.

582
00:37:34,446 --> 00:37:36,646
[SPEAKER_03]: She was participating in a roast for somebody.

583
00:37:36,826 --> 00:37:38,307
[SPEAKER_03]: She is snarky.

584
00:37:39,027 --> 00:37:39,367
[SPEAKER_03]: I love her.

585
00:37:39,913 --> 00:37:42,654
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100 Matt says, Rob, I'll tell YYR to get right on it.

586
00:37:42,714 --> 00:37:44,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Please, please make that happen.

587
00:37:45,155 --> 00:37:47,496
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care who does it.

588
00:37:47,517 --> 00:37:48,417
[SPEAKER_06]: We need that to happen.

589
00:37:49,057 --> 00:37:50,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma says, call it three old biddies.

590
00:37:51,138 --> 00:37:51,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, weren't there four?

591
00:37:52,379 --> 00:37:54,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess one was the mom, so whatever.

592
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,281
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100 Matt says, wait, wait, is this an OLR dream game?

593
00:37:58,521 --> 00:38:00,062
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a Rob Roberts dream game.

594
00:38:00,082 --> 00:38:01,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Three biddies in the hoe.

595
00:38:07,222 --> 00:38:08,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's just me.

596
00:38:09,084 --> 00:38:09,825
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's just me.

597
00:38:25,462 --> 00:38:26,002
[SPEAKER_06]: And wow.

598
00:38:26,142 --> 00:38:31,485
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, this is my new favorite person that I've ever heard on a podcast.

599
00:38:31,845 --> 00:38:33,906
[SPEAKER_06]: She named her character after the Golden Girls.

600
00:38:34,106 --> 00:38:40,308
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think Michelle or somebody else popped in and said, yeah, I named one of my priests Betty Smite.

601
00:38:44,528 --> 00:38:46,629
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

602
00:38:47,169 --> 00:38:54,992
[SPEAKER_03]: My next Star Trek character is going to be... I'm just going to name her Sophia the Old.

603
00:38:56,593 --> 00:38:58,754
[SPEAKER_03]: And pick the old person face and everything.

604
00:38:59,134 --> 00:39:00,835
[SPEAKER_03]: And make her super short and Ferengi.

605
00:39:01,335 --> 00:39:04,156
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to put that on the list of people I want to have on OLR in the future.

606
00:39:04,196 --> 00:39:05,536
[SPEAKER_06]: The chick that named her character is Zbornak.

607
00:39:05,556 --> 00:39:07,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's awesome.

608
00:39:08,117 --> 00:39:09,478
[SPEAKER_06]: You're a true inspiration to us all.

609
00:39:10,003 --> 00:39:16,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's move on to other gaming news Loki's just sitting here going, what is this show tonight?

610
00:39:17,237 --> 00:39:17,738
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know

611
00:39:19,574 --> 00:39:40,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, just like Nintendo to delay some stuff, actually just like anybody to delay some stuff, but Nintendo in this particular instance has delayed two upcoming games that are very highly anticipated, including Sin and Punishment Star Successor and Metroid Other M. Sin and Punishment's only been pushed back a few weeks, from June 7th to June 27th,

612
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:50,036
[SPEAKER_07]: and, unfortunately though, the Metroid Other M game, which was originally due on June 27th.

613
00:39:50,497 --> 00:39:52,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's been pushed all the way to August 31st.

614
00:39:52,799 --> 00:39:55,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that was the day after my birthday and I'm going to have to wait two more months.

615
00:39:57,563 --> 00:40:00,466
[SPEAKER_06]: That gives me enough time to actually hook up my Nintendo Wii again.

616
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:03,168
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't plugged it in since I moved.

617
00:40:05,208 --> 00:40:06,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are these games being delayed, Loki?

618
00:40:07,569 --> 00:40:11,890
[SPEAKER_07]: No reason was given other than it's Nintendo just doing Nintendo things.

619
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:19,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think that maybe the games aren't finished or they failed some type of quality check or what?

620
00:40:19,392 --> 00:40:20,973
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that they're not finished yet.

621
00:40:21,113 --> 00:40:25,674
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that they're just spacing out their titles for the rest of the year.

622
00:40:25,794 --> 00:40:26,155
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

623
00:40:27,595 --> 00:40:31,896
[SPEAKER_07]: They had two games coming out in June that really didn't have anything on the plate for the rest of the summer.

624
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:37,198
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe polishing Metroid Other M a little bit more.

625
00:40:38,898 --> 00:40:42,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Or maybe they're going to add some gimmicky crap to add on to it.

626
00:40:42,999 --> 00:40:48,721
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope to God they're not delaying this to add on some vitality sensor support or some crap like that.

627
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:50,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I hope not either.

628
00:40:51,622 --> 00:40:54,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, at least you'll get to play it at E3, I'm sure.

629
00:40:55,483 --> 00:40:56,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I guess that's true.

630
00:40:57,406 --> 00:41:04,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, all this news about the Nintendo Wii and the delays leads me into a little something I want to do on tonight's show.

631
00:41:04,216 --> 00:41:11,527
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't do this very often, especially on the podcast, but we're gonna do a little something called Secret Club tonight is what we're gonna do here on the show.

632
00:41:13,712 --> 00:41:14,493
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

633
00:41:34,655 --> 00:41:38,757
[SPEAKER_06]: I have secrets where it's like, hey Rob, I have a secret.

634
00:41:38,837 --> 00:41:42,018
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you tell anyone this, I'm going to beat your fucking ass with my shoe.

635
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Those I don't tell anybody.

636
00:41:43,798 --> 00:41:48,000
[SPEAKER_06]: But then there's the ones that's like, hey Rob, I found out this little piece of news and I don't care who you tell.

637
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,321
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a little something secret.

638
00:41:51,021 --> 00:41:51,722
[SPEAKER_06]: The Black Nintendo Wii

639
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:13,750
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

640
00:42:33,975 --> 00:42:51,392
[SPEAKER_06]: and apparently this actually ties into something we've heard about before because this is the bundle that's also going to include we're not sure and the details were a little sketchy from my source because he couldn't remember if it was that it was coming with just the Wii Motion Plus or if it was the Wii Motion Plus and Wii Sports Resort.

641
00:42:51,412 --> 00:42:51,852
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Wii Sports

642
00:42:53,113 --> 00:42:59,980
[SPEAKER_06]: But Loki has previously heard of that there was going to be a new bundle that matched what we saw at Walmart before, but we're putting two and two together.

643
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,844
[SPEAKER_06]: What Loki had probably heard about before is actually going to be this black Nintendo Wii bundle.

644
00:43:05,365 --> 00:43:05,725
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

645
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:16,533
[SPEAKER_07]: There was no color specifications or anything, just basically that they're going to be releasing new bundles soon and that we probably weren't going to get any.

646
00:43:17,774 --> 00:43:18,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they're dicks.

647
00:43:19,315 --> 00:43:22,936
[SPEAKER_06]: And folks from chat, I haven't heard anything else about the specs.

648
00:43:23,036 --> 00:43:24,037
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not HT.

649
00:43:24,157 --> 00:43:24,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Dream on, guys.

650
00:43:25,157 --> 00:43:26,398
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's just a Wii.

651
00:43:26,498 --> 00:43:27,779
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just another bundle.

652
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,520
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the same damn Wii, except here's the difference.

653
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:34,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of white plastic, they used black plastic instead.

654
00:43:35,322 --> 00:43:35,863
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

655
00:43:36,463 --> 00:43:37,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't expect anything else.

656
00:43:38,105 --> 00:43:39,487
[SPEAKER_06]: So, sorry, it's not HD.

657
00:43:39,567 --> 00:43:47,776
[SPEAKER_07]: And you might be getting an extra free game, because I'm assuming they're also including Wii Sports in there, so you get Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort.

658
00:43:47,936 --> 00:43:49,818
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd be nice if they added another controller into it.

659
00:43:50,939 --> 00:43:51,279
[SPEAKER_07]: I doubt it.

660
00:43:51,299 --> 00:43:52,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

661
00:43:53,081 --> 00:43:54,362
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's supposed to be the same price.

662
00:43:54,622 --> 00:43:55,263
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not positive.

663
00:43:55,323 --> 00:43:55,623
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.

664
00:43:55,843 --> 00:43:58,185
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be the exact... I must have forgot to say that.

665
00:43:58,245 --> 00:44:00,948
[SPEAKER_06]: It is the exact same price as the Wii you're paying for today.

666
00:44:01,148 --> 00:44:03,089
[SPEAKER_06]: So in a way, it's a bit of a price drop too.

667
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:08,394
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wonder what they're going to do with the... I think it actually may be replacing the old Wii SKUs.

668
00:44:08,474 --> 00:44:09,034
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it is.

669
00:44:09,374 --> 00:44:11,076
[SPEAKER_07]: So white Wiis are going to be rare.

670
00:44:11,136 --> 00:44:11,556
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

671
00:44:11,576 --> 00:44:12,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Super rare.

672
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:15,478
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw in chat says, a BlackWee is a no-brainer.

673
00:44:15,518 --> 00:44:19,859
[SPEAKER_06]: We sort of had a hint of that recently when we saw a BlackWee moat on the most recent trailer for Metroid Other Realm.

674
00:44:19,879 --> 00:44:21,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they're already selling BlackWee moats, aren't they?

675
00:44:21,499 --> 00:44:21,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they are.

676
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:26,900
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the folks overseas are saying, ah, we've already had the BlackWee.

677
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:27,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

678
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,361
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not controlling the news.

679
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:31,501
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't write the news.

680
00:44:31,541 --> 00:44:32,221
[SPEAKER_06]: I just report it.

681
00:44:32,261 --> 00:44:33,662
[SPEAKER_06]: The BlackWee is not out in the States.

682
00:44:34,102 --> 00:44:37,062
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're finally getting it May 23rd.

683
00:44:37,102 --> 00:44:38,343
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what I'm telling you is the date.

684
00:44:39,263 --> 00:44:39,423
[SPEAKER_06]: May 23rd.

685
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:45,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, yeah, it's already been out in other parts of the world.

686
00:44:45,292 --> 00:44:46,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't they have other colors too?

687
00:44:46,412 --> 00:44:47,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, remember E3 years ago?

688
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:50,574
[SPEAKER_06]: There was like a pink Wii and a blue Wii and all this other stuff?

689
00:44:51,435 --> 00:44:51,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

690
00:44:52,896 --> 00:44:54,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, Tiger... No, I'm sorry.

691
00:44:55,117 --> 00:44:58,538
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100Matt says, So wait, the black Wii isn't bigger than the white Wii?

692
00:45:00,019 --> 00:45:00,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Ha ha ha.

693
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:02,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Ha ha ha.

694
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody's a jokester here at Orange Laundry.

695
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:04,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Ha ha ha.

696
00:45:07,443 --> 00:45:09,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Going back to something we were talking about a little bit earlier...

697
00:45:11,129 --> 00:45:17,714
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw sent me this link in chat, and I just have to share this with you guys, this link on YouTube that is just pretty fabulous here.

698
00:45:20,216 --> 00:45:29,182
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what could be... It's an actual... Somebody did this on the NES.

699
00:45:29,222 --> 00:45:30,443
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a hack or something.

700
00:45:30,503 --> 00:45:36,147
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what... I don't know what that is.

701
00:45:36,187 --> 00:45:38,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Some type of hacked NES cartridge or something.

702
00:45:42,734 --> 00:45:44,837
[SPEAKER_06]: So somebody's already started making my dream game.

703
00:45:44,917 --> 00:45:47,640
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's move on to some real games, shall we?

704
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:48,341
[SPEAKER_06]: How about Halo?

705
00:45:48,401 --> 00:45:49,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, don't tune out.

706
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:51,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Halo, I've got Halo updates.

707
00:45:51,285 --> 00:45:53,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Halo, Halo Reach specifically.

708
00:45:54,148 --> 00:45:56,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Halo Reach apparently is going to, well, you know...

709
00:45:58,593 --> 00:45:59,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Halo Reach is coming out soon.

710
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:28,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Limited version has a special case, collectibles, and in-game armor.

711
00:46:29,576 --> 00:46:35,841
[SPEAKER_06]: The $150 option apparently has all of that, but also has, I guess, more unique packaging and in-game armor.

712
00:46:36,361 --> 00:46:39,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, a legendary Noble Six sculpture.

713
00:46:40,124 --> 00:46:47,349
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if that's anything like the little Master Chief hat that you could put on your cat for lols, but you couldn't really put it on your cat, just so you know.

714
00:46:47,469 --> 00:46:48,910
[SPEAKER_06]: But sounds kind of similar.

715
00:46:50,331 --> 00:46:54,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't you still get that Halo $150 edition for like $60 now discounted at price?

716
00:46:54,713 --> 00:46:56,273
[SPEAKER_07]: There's people still sitting on that stuff.

717
00:46:56,353 --> 00:46:56,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

718
00:46:57,234 --> 00:46:57,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

719
00:46:57,794 --> 00:46:58,414
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not surprised.

720
00:46:58,474 --> 00:47:00,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully this will sell a little better, but we'll see.

721
00:47:01,555 --> 00:47:04,917
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think about all this game coming out in three different flavors, Loki?

722
00:47:05,657 --> 00:47:08,678
[SPEAKER_07]: They did it with Halo 3, and it was kind of fun.

723
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:14,320
[SPEAKER_07]: But hopefully people have learned, you know, you don't need to spend the money to get a fake helmet.

724
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:17,041
[SPEAKER_07]: At least this has a nice sculpture that comes with it.

725
00:47:17,962 --> 00:47:18,842
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't pay that, though.

726
00:47:20,583 --> 00:47:23,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because if you think about it, you're basically paying, I mean, between $80 and $150.

727
00:47:24,065 --> 00:47:25,887
[SPEAKER_06]: You're paying like $70 for the sculpture.

728
00:47:26,027 --> 00:47:29,409
[SPEAKER_06]: You could use that money to get another game if you wanted.

729
00:47:29,609 --> 00:47:35,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you could use it to invest and have $200 next year.

730
00:47:36,554 --> 00:47:36,894
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

731
00:47:37,775 --> 00:47:38,315
[SPEAKER_06]: But there it is.

732
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:42,738
[SPEAKER_06]: I realize there are the fans that will pay that money to have every little thing Halo.

733
00:47:42,758 --> 00:47:44,259
[SPEAKER_06]: And who am I to criticize?

734
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:47,461
[SPEAKER_06]: If it was Final Fantasy XIV, I'd probably be doing the same thing.

735
00:47:47,701 --> 00:47:49,322
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be like, $150, that's it?

736
00:47:49,342 --> 00:47:50,143
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm paying the money right now.

737
00:47:51,884 --> 00:47:52,424
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.

738
00:47:53,285 --> 00:47:59,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we've got some word from BimaniStyle about Stride Nasty stuff that's sponsoring it.

739
00:47:59,929 --> 00:48:04,152
[SPEAKER_03]: And keep in mind, I am completely allergic to it and I don't even like to say the name of it, so it's nasty.

740
00:48:04,472 --> 00:48:05,753
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll say it, Stride Gum.

741
00:48:06,053 --> 00:48:06,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Nasty!

742
00:48:08,567 --> 00:48:09,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Save the Arcades 2.

743
00:48:12,249 --> 00:48:20,633
[SPEAKER_03]: But Arcade Infinity is actually one of the ones up in the competition for it.

744
00:48:21,933 --> 00:48:26,055
[SPEAKER_03]: AI has been a really big staple in the Bitmoney community.

745
00:48:26,075 --> 00:48:27,476
[SPEAKER_03]: They had all the imports in.

746
00:48:27,736 --> 00:48:29,837
[SPEAKER_03]: They also had that weird Gundam game that was so cool.

747
00:48:30,357 --> 00:48:32,618
[SPEAKER_03]: And little Japanese ticket games.

748
00:48:32,718 --> 00:48:34,659
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jammer Lamy.

749
00:48:34,899 --> 00:48:36,740
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's in LA, in case you didn't know.

750
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:36,960
[SPEAKER_03]: A little...

751
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,241
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

752
00:48:57,797 --> 00:49:00,520
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where Loki, did you play some crazy porn game there once?

753
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:01,161
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really funny.

754
00:49:02,162 --> 00:49:03,924
[SPEAKER_07]: I played a lot of crazy porn games there.

755
00:49:04,384 --> 00:49:08,429
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where I first played Gal's Panic and Dancing Eyes.

756
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:15,223
[SPEAKER_03]: But at any rate, the competition is going on until June 15th.

757
00:49:15,683 --> 00:49:23,826
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're talking about the AI, the owner says that if they win, they want to get Tycho and Jubit.

758
00:49:24,786 --> 00:49:31,528
[SPEAKER_03]: But you have to play a game of Cowbots 2010 and donate your final score to the arcade you wish to support.

759
00:49:32,248 --> 00:49:34,469
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's at savethearcades.stridegum.com

760
00:49:35,089 --> 00:49:38,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, is Arcade Infinity in, like, danger of closing or something?

761
00:49:38,272 --> 00:49:40,353
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, haven't they been threatening to close for a little while now?

762
00:49:40,413 --> 00:49:46,238
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see anything really about... But they're talking about if they won, they'd get a Jubeet machine and all this other stuff?

763
00:49:46,298 --> 00:49:47,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Ubeat or whatever it's called?

764
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:48,700
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

765
00:49:49,281 --> 00:49:49,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Weird.

766
00:49:49,601 --> 00:49:52,143
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just going on the... Hmm.

767
00:49:52,523 --> 00:49:53,384
[SPEAKER_03]: The little board there.

768
00:49:53,624 --> 00:49:54,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, we're not picking you up.

769
00:49:54,465 --> 00:49:55,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you turn your mic?

770
00:49:55,506 --> 00:49:56,086
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking.

771
00:49:56,307 --> 00:49:56,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

772
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:57,528
[SPEAKER_06]: You weren't talking in the mic.

773
00:49:58,508 --> 00:49:58,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh!

774
00:49:58,729 --> 00:49:59,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

775
00:50:00,447 --> 00:50:01,448
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

776
00:50:25,263 --> 00:50:28,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, start things off with Super Street Fighter 4.

777
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:32,427
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

778
00:50:33,507 --> 00:50:41,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, Nier, that kind of a beat-em-up game from Square Enix, coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week as well.

779
00:50:42,712 --> 00:50:46,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Dead the Rights Retribution, also on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

780
00:50:46,774 --> 00:51:07,281
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're a fan of sexual innuendo and boobies, Record of Argus War, the limited edition or the, what was it, the naughty, I forget, some naughty edition or whatever, coming out on Xbox 360 does include a mouse pad with fake boobs on it and a pillowcase with some chick on it.

781
00:51:07,901 --> 00:51:09,022
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's going to be kind of neat.

782
00:51:10,402 --> 00:51:21,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Harvest Moon Hero of Leaf Valley coming out on PSP Splinter Cell Conviction making its way out on PC this week with wonderful DRM in tow and

783
00:51:23,442 --> 00:51:28,665
[SPEAKER_07]: FreeRunning, a parkour sim, coming out on the Wii this week.

784
00:51:29,926 --> 00:51:39,352
[SPEAKER_07]: 2010 FIFA World Cup, South Africa, coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and PSP.

785
00:51:39,632 --> 00:51:41,173
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think there's a DS version on that one.

786
00:51:43,535 --> 00:51:43,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

787
00:51:46,793 --> 00:51:49,014
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe that's it.

788
00:51:50,174 --> 00:51:51,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, this is actually a pretty good deal.

789
00:51:52,295 --> 00:51:58,116
[SPEAKER_07]: PixelJunk Monsters Deluxe making its way out on PSP in the UMD format.

790
00:51:58,136 --> 00:52:02,558
[SPEAKER_07]: They've had this originally on the PlayStation Network, but now you can buy it on UMD.

791
00:52:03,218 --> 00:52:03,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Only $10.

792
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:07,759
[SPEAKER_07]: And it includes, I believe, some of the expansions for that.

793
00:52:08,059 --> 00:52:11,460
[SPEAKER_07]: They're doing the same thing, too, with Fat Princess coming out a little bit later on in May.

794
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:14,181
[SPEAKER_07]: So, not a bad thing at all.

795
00:52:15,493 --> 00:52:17,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Any of that that you're going to pick up, Loki?

796
00:52:19,416 --> 00:52:21,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me try Super Street Fighter 4.

797
00:52:22,638 --> 00:52:26,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm going to pick up Super Street Fighter 4.

798
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:31,184
[SPEAKER_06]: But this time I'm getting it on PS3 because I would like to actually be able to control it better.

799
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:33,305
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's my whole thought there.

800
00:52:34,066 --> 00:52:35,367
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why you get arcade sticks, Rob.

801
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:36,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Or just play it over here.

802
00:52:37,068 --> 00:52:38,289
[SPEAKER_03]: You're talking more money.

803
00:52:38,769 --> 00:52:40,010
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're worth it.

804
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:47,779
[SPEAKER_06]: and Xbox 360 in Japan sees the release of Super Street Fighter 4 this week as well in a regular and collector's edition.

805
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:51,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, Splinter Cell Conviction is your other big release in Japan this week.

806
00:52:51,484 --> 00:52:54,648
[SPEAKER_06]: See some of the same games we're getting here also get released in Japan at the same time.

807
00:52:54,708 --> 00:52:55,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine that.

808
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:58,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking at some other consoles.

809
00:52:58,891 --> 00:53:00,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Going over to the PlayStation 3.

810
00:53:01,073 --> 00:53:01,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Same, same.

811
00:53:01,994 --> 00:53:03,695
[SPEAKER_06]: They also get Super Street Fighter 4 over there.

812
00:53:04,395 --> 00:53:05,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Regular and collector's edition.

813
00:53:06,357 --> 00:53:12,601
[SPEAKER_06]: World Soccer winning 11-20-10 gets a price reduction for whatever that's worth if you're a big fan of these soccer sims.

814
00:53:14,082 --> 00:53:23,587
[SPEAKER_06]: On the Nintendo Wii, not really a lot this week, Base Fishing Wii World Tournament, Andukensa X, and a game called Rooms comes out as well from Hudson.

815
00:53:23,627 --> 00:53:25,408
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all on the Nintendo Wii this week.

816
00:53:26,149 --> 00:53:31,692
[SPEAKER_06]: On the PlayStation 2, I like the name of this game, Love Route Zero, Kiss Kiss Labyrinth.

817
00:53:32,552 --> 00:53:34,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's really the name of the game.

818
00:53:34,274 --> 00:53:36,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Love Root Zero, Kiss Kiss Labyrinth.

819
00:53:37,076 --> 00:53:38,137
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an adventure game.

820
00:53:38,678 --> 00:53:40,399
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no idea what you do in this game.

821
00:53:40,419 --> 00:53:42,041
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no screenshots.

822
00:53:42,121 --> 00:53:47,065
[SPEAKER_06]: But the box art looks to be like all these dudes in school outfits.

823
00:53:47,746 --> 00:53:49,648
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's this girl who looks like the prom queen.

824
00:53:50,088 --> 00:53:52,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, why am I trying to figure this out?

825
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:53,251
[SPEAKER_06]: None of you are going to play it.

826
00:53:53,431 --> 00:53:54,032
[SPEAKER_06]: I already know that.

827
00:53:54,072 --> 00:53:54,853
[SPEAKER_06]: None of you are going to play it.

828
00:53:55,974 --> 00:53:59,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Going on to the handheld systems and looking at what is coming out on the Nintendo DS.

829
00:53:59,977 --> 00:54:05,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 2 is a big release from Squeenix this week on the Nintendo DS.

830
00:54:06,182 --> 00:54:11,487
[SPEAKER_06]: And lastly on the Sony PSP, Iki Tosun Cross Impact.

831
00:54:11,527 --> 00:54:15,570
[SPEAKER_06]: And that cross is spelled with an actual X, just to be complicated.

832
00:54:15,951 --> 00:54:17,572
[SPEAKER_06]: That is coming out in Japan this week.

833
00:54:18,553 --> 00:54:21,816
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a sequel to a former PSP game.

834
00:54:22,957 --> 00:54:26,259
[SPEAKER_06]: 2D scrolling action, 22 girls in this beat-em-up game.

835
00:54:26,299 --> 00:54:26,980
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not Arcana Heart.

836
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,801
[SPEAKER_07]: And their clothes come off, sort of.

837
00:54:29,121 --> 00:54:30,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that really what this is about?

838
00:54:30,202 --> 00:54:31,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's what Ikitoshin's about.

839
00:54:33,044 --> 00:54:35,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Based on what I've seen, I guess.

840
00:54:35,486 --> 00:54:35,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

841
00:54:35,867 --> 00:54:40,030
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's they fight and their clothes rip in very provocative ways, I guess.

842
00:54:40,550 --> 00:55:08,523
[SPEAKER_06]: also Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker I bet some of you guys might want to get that there's also a full PSP pack for that game coming out and I just like the name of this game Marriage Royale Prism Story is also coming out it's an adventure game I don't really know what happens in this game I guess it's like you play the girl going to get married but I want to point this out there's a screenshot here where you have these three cute little anime girls they're like working out or something but they forgot their pants that is tragic actually

843
00:55:09,093 --> 00:55:09,573
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

844
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:33,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so if you want some culturally different things there, you can check out that game, but you probably won't.

845
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, how about the UK, DarkSakura?

846
00:55:36,921 --> 00:55:37,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, how about them?

847
00:55:38,441 --> 00:55:39,001
[SPEAKER_03]: How about it?

848
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:42,203
[SPEAKER_03]: On the 28th, Serious Sam HD, The Second Encounter.

849
00:55:43,303 --> 00:55:45,904
[SPEAKER_03]: The 30th, 2010 FIFA World Cup, yay.

850
00:55:46,745 --> 00:55:49,125
[SPEAKER_03]: 30th, God of War Collection, Iron Man 2.

851
00:55:50,666 --> 00:55:59,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Splinter Cell Conviction, Super Street Fighter 4, WarioWare Do It Yourself, and Wings of Prey.

852
00:56:01,412 --> 00:56:01,852
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

853
00:56:03,013 --> 00:56:06,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Too bad it's not the Birds of Prey making its way to a video game.

854
00:56:06,815 --> 00:56:08,035
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be kind of awesome.

855
00:56:09,936 --> 00:56:10,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Or not.

856
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:11,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Loki.

857
00:56:12,778 --> 00:56:13,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, yes.

858
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so we talked a little bit.

859
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,121
[SPEAKER_07]: I said that we had

860
00:56:20,638 --> 00:56:24,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Splinter Cell Conviction coming out this week and there's horrible DRM in tow.

861
00:56:24,682 --> 00:56:26,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that might not be that big of a problem.

862
00:56:27,264 --> 00:56:34,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently the hacker community, which I thought this happened weeks ago, but maybe they finally figured out how to do it the correct way.

863
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:39,675
[SPEAKER_07]: They have found a way to get rid of the DRM that's in

864
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:41,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Skid Row

865
00:57:04,488 --> 00:57:04,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Fun name.

866
00:57:05,668 --> 00:57:06,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

867
00:57:07,469 --> 00:57:09,229
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, it is a little bit different.

868
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:21,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Before they had different hacks that were just emulating the authentication server or they were finding some way to trick this, but this actually removes the DRM from the title.

869
00:57:22,411 --> 00:57:24,652
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's interesting.

870
00:57:24,832 --> 00:57:32,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, Loki, your pal Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, the hack before worked up until a certain point of the game, then it locked up.

871
00:57:32,153 --> 00:57:34,956
[SPEAKER_06]: So this must be news that now it's working for the entire game.

872
00:57:35,697 --> 00:57:36,397
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

873
00:57:37,899 --> 00:57:41,623
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Loki, I mean, does this really surprise you?

874
00:57:41,643 --> 00:57:44,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I kind of look at this and go, yeah, I already thought this happened too.

875
00:57:44,866 --> 00:57:47,008
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought this happened within days after the DRM.

876
00:57:47,969 --> 00:57:48,710
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not surprised.

877
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:52,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially, you know, something like this that's annoying a lot of people.

878
00:57:52,854 --> 00:57:53,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Not only...

879
00:57:55,235 --> 00:58:02,198
[SPEAKER_07]: The fact that they're coming out and saying, oh, this is going to stop piracy of our titles, it just goes to show you're going to waste money on this.

880
00:58:02,698 --> 00:58:05,879
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it slows people down, but it definitely doesn't stop it.

881
00:58:06,739 --> 00:58:10,260
[SPEAKER_07]: And really, in the end, the only people who get hurt are the people that legitimately buy the game.

882
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:15,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, now, if you don't like the DRM, you can just go search online for the crack.

883
00:58:16,634 --> 00:58:19,177
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand the need for DRM.

884
00:58:19,457 --> 00:58:24,202
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not somebody who says, oh, every game should just not have DRM at all.

885
00:58:24,663 --> 00:58:26,605
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think what Ubisoft was doing was overkill.

886
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:27,386
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on.

887
00:58:27,426 --> 00:58:30,669
[SPEAKER_06]: When you disconnect from the internet at all, your game dumps.

888
00:58:31,069 --> 00:58:38,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know how much I get disconnected from World of Warcraft because Comcast decides to fart on me and I'll be in the middle of something and it completely screws up my game?

889
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:44,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh, at least that isn't a long-term irritating thing.

890
00:58:45,121 --> 00:58:52,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas I could see if I'm playing through one of these games and I'm not at a safe point, maybe I just cleared a really tough part of the game, it's like, oh, you're screwed, you've got to do it again.

891
00:58:53,025 --> 00:58:59,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it'd be different if it was like, okay, we noticed it disconnected, we're saving your progress now.

892
00:59:00,629 --> 00:59:02,990
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can restart here later once it...

893
00:59:03,590 --> 00:59:04,111
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

894
00:59:04,131 --> 00:59:05,652
[SPEAKER_07]: The thing is, I'm not buying their games on PC.

895
00:59:05,692 --> 00:59:07,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if I were buying their games, which I'm not.

896
00:59:07,113 --> 00:59:07,173
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

897
00:59:23,927 --> 00:59:51,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright Well, a couple last stories for you guys Then we're going to get into the classic game of the week Where DarkSakura is going to walk down the vaults of gaming's history And pick out a game that she thinks you kids ought to check out this week But first, something about a newer series Something that's kind of been a bit under the radar And I think that is a pity And that is DJ Hero DJ Hero, of course, we know that DJ Hero is getting a sequel this year And little, little details are starting to trickle out about it

898
00:59:52,044 --> 01:00:14,580
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Shadow apparently is going to be working on the next DJ Hero He actually said in an interview on Radio 1 It was interesting, I'm actually working on the next one as well But yeah, it was a trip So there you go, he's going to be in the second game Also notable, he was in the first game too So he's like a repeat And I kind of figured that would happen How many world famous DJs are there?

899
01:00:15,541 --> 01:00:16,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there really enough?

900
01:00:16,382 --> 01:00:17,362
[SPEAKER_06]: World famous guys.

901
01:00:17,383 --> 01:00:18,043
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of them.

902
01:00:18,103 --> 01:00:20,465
[SPEAKER_06]: World famous, meaning America famous too.

903
01:00:20,485 --> 01:00:23,007
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a lot of DJs, I think, out there that are world famous.

904
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:29,171
[SPEAKER_07]: But how many of them are you going to get to be in DJ Hero?

905
01:00:29,552 --> 01:00:36,777
[SPEAKER_07]: I was very disappointed that they had DJ Jazzy Jeff and there were no Will Smith songs in there at all.

906
01:00:36,917 --> 01:00:39,519
[SPEAKER_07]: No mixes with Will Smith track in there.

907
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:41,041
[SPEAKER_07]: That was very disappointing.

908
01:00:41,321 --> 01:00:41,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

909
01:00:43,203 --> 01:00:43,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there you go.

910
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:48,746
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Shadow is going to be in the next game in DJ Hero 2.

911
01:00:49,106 --> 01:00:51,568
[SPEAKER_06]: But DJ Hero 1, All Love Is Not Lost.

912
01:00:51,948 --> 01:00:53,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, you'll be happy to hear this.

913
01:00:53,329 --> 01:00:55,090
[SPEAKER_06]: There's actually another track pack coming out.

914
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:57,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this one I'm actually kind of excited about.

915
01:00:57,131 --> 01:00:58,512
[SPEAKER_06]: The last ones kind of suck.

916
01:00:59,272 --> 01:01:23,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Darude's Sandstorm mixed with Josh Wink's Higher State of Consciousness is one of the songs in the new DLC Danny Bird's Red Mist VIP is coming out as well and then this song Wolfgang Gartner's Wolfgang's Fifth Symphony let me start off by saying that this song reminded me of something that you would see in DDR and here's a little clip of what this song sounds like

917
01:01:40,792 --> 01:01:41,156
[SPEAKER_06]: and me.

918
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:46,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Boom Boom Rocket, The Domination Pack

919
01:02:16,698 --> 01:02:18,139
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I guess that song sounded okay.

920
01:02:18,499 --> 01:02:19,520
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a little noisy for me.

921
01:02:20,801 --> 01:02:22,842
[SPEAKER_06]: But I guess that's because there was so much mixing going on.

922
01:02:23,062 --> 01:02:23,362
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

923
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:25,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that that's the thing.

924
01:02:26,744 --> 01:02:28,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the effects are a little overdone.

925
01:02:28,545 --> 01:02:31,007
[SPEAKER_06]: There's people that are going to like it, don't get me wrong.

926
01:02:31,227 --> 01:02:31,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Good for them.

927
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:33,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, I don't know if I'll buy it.

928
01:02:34,189 --> 01:02:35,990
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm curious to hear what the other songs sound like though.

929
01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:42,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, let's get to the part of the show where we like to take a trip down the halls of gaming history.

930
01:02:44,944 --> 01:02:51,667
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura is going to jump into the vault and dive in and find a game that she says, hey, you ungrateful little children.

931
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:55,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Because she says that a lot when she's not teaching him Doctor Who references.

932
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:57,850
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't teach him that.

933
01:02:58,270 --> 01:02:58,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my bad.

934
01:02:59,111 --> 01:03:00,391
[SPEAKER_03]: He watches Doctor Who.

935
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:07,394
[SPEAKER_06]: You kids ought to be playing this classic video game so you can see where the games of today came from.

936
01:03:07,835 --> 01:03:10,796
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what is the classic video game of the week this week?

937
01:03:11,346 --> 01:03:24,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Warcraft, Orcs and Humans Oh snap I put it in for all of you addicts who don't know your roots Fair enough, Warcraft, Orcs and Humans Freaking boring ass game

938
01:03:26,448 --> 01:03:27,529
[SPEAKER_06]: This game is awesome.

939
01:03:27,589 --> 01:03:28,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut your mouth.

940
01:03:28,610 --> 01:03:28,890
[SPEAKER_03]: See?

941
01:03:30,051 --> 01:03:31,092
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted that reaction.

942
01:03:31,632 --> 01:03:36,916
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't put this in really for me because I hate real-time strategy games.

943
01:03:37,137 --> 01:03:37,877
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like them.

944
01:03:37,977 --> 01:03:38,998
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not have fun with them.

945
01:03:40,339 --> 01:03:43,341
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are enough of you who don't...

946
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:50,070
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually mentioned to someone, I was like, you know, when World of Warcraft was coming out, I was like, so did you play Warcraft before?

947
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:50,831
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it just came out.

948
01:04:04,867 --> 01:04:05,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Poor child.

949
01:04:05,788 --> 01:04:06,088
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

950
01:04:06,108 --> 01:04:08,210
[SPEAKER_03]: So tonight is about edumacation.

951
01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:09,511
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about edumacation.

952
01:04:10,292 --> 01:04:11,813
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's a real-time strategy game.

953
01:04:12,393 --> 01:04:16,757
[SPEAKER_03]: It came out in 1994, November 1994, and came out on the Mac in 96.

954
01:04:17,978 --> 01:04:20,861
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a sequel, Warcraft 2, Tides of Darkness.

955
01:04:21,041 --> 01:04:23,583
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, Warcraft 3, Warcraft.

956
01:04:24,103 --> 01:04:29,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Warcraft 3 came out not too long ago, which if you look on Dan's little shelf there, he's got a copy.

957
01:04:30,289 --> 01:04:32,170
[SPEAKER_03]: So Dan obviously likes it.

958
01:04:33,591 --> 01:04:45,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, uh, it's basically, um, you know, like I said, real-time strategy where you have the humans of Azeroth against the invading orcs.

959
01:04:46,541 --> 01:04:47,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooooooh.

960
01:04:48,183 --> 01:04:50,304
[SPEAKER_03]: And then both sides have to fight off wild monsters.

961
01:04:51,145 --> 01:04:52,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooooooh.

962
01:04:52,426 --> 01:04:54,147
[SPEAKER_03]: But sometimes you can enlist the monsters.

963
01:04:54,708 --> 01:04:55,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooooooh.

964
01:04:56,550 --> 01:05:01,075
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically you've got your melee groups, you have ranged groups, and spellcasters.

965
01:05:02,317 --> 01:05:11,408
[SPEAKER_03]: It is built off of the Dune 2 gameplay, which is like build a base, build an army, destroy the enemy, blah blah blah.

966
01:05:12,269 --> 01:05:23,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Different mission types where you have rebels of each player's size so you can rescue rebuilt towns and friendly forces and do all this other stuff.

967
01:05:24,601 --> 01:05:28,164
[SPEAKER_03]: And you also had to be able to efficiently use your platoon.

968
01:05:30,746 --> 01:05:34,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Also in one mission you have to kill the orc chief's daughter or something.

969
01:05:36,232 --> 01:05:43,400
[SPEAKER_03]: It also let you use land so that you could play against each other.

970
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:46,584
[SPEAKER_03]: So it had that start of the MMO, remember?

971
01:05:49,347 --> 01:05:50,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Sort of, yeah.

972
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:53,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the old school Battle.net, yeah.

973
01:05:54,132 --> 01:05:56,094
[SPEAKER_06]: But I was more Diablo on Battle.net.

974
01:05:56,872 --> 01:05:59,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you have to go through with this.

975
01:05:59,514 --> 01:06:01,775
[SPEAKER_03]: You also have to cultivate your resources.

976
01:06:01,836 --> 01:06:07,079
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to be careful about where you dig for gold, where you chop your wood.

977
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:11,943
[SPEAKER_03]: If you exhaust your resources, then you have to get them differently.

978
01:06:13,444 --> 01:06:16,566
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to basically regrow your forest while you're

979
01:06:16,846 --> 01:06:16,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

980
01:06:46,227 --> 01:06:58,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, it actually was... See, I thought that it was... I played some a little bit, but like I said, I don't really care for RTS games.

981
01:06:59,673 --> 01:07:00,853
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sort of like, what?

982
01:07:01,234 --> 01:07:03,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I can play them, and I'm good at them.

983
01:07:03,274 --> 01:07:04,315
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just sort of like, what?

984
01:07:04,355 --> 01:07:04,975
[SPEAKER_03]: This is boring.

985
01:07:06,156 --> 01:07:11,558
[SPEAKER_03]: But it clearly caught on, I mean, because remember we had StarCraft.

986
01:07:12,999 --> 01:07:13,659
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the whole...

987
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:20,575
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess themes to the game sort of caught on to and now we've got World of Warcraft making it less sucky.

988
01:07:23,297 --> 01:07:26,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, this is Jamie who does not like RTSs.

989
01:07:26,899 --> 01:07:30,622
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually own this game and I loved it.

990
01:07:32,183 --> 01:07:38,628
[SPEAKER_03]: There is actually an RTS game that I like but it's a Macross game that came out on the PC Engine CD.

991
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:57,786
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say this though, I am weird I fully admit I'm weird because I don't really care for StarCraft and I to this day have never played Warcraft 3 we've got it right here I just for some reason have never played it I really should because maybe some of the stuff in World of Warcraft would make more sense but yeah, I have played the old school Warcraft and I did play Warcraft 2

992
01:07:59,129 --> 01:08:13,898
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually tried to make it a point to put in games that I can be really excited about, but it was just, you know, it seemed to me that with everybody being all World of Warcraft, World of Warcraft, blah blah blah blah blah, you know, it helps to know where it came from.

993
01:08:14,038 --> 01:08:15,179
[SPEAKER_03]: It helps to go back to your roots.

994
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:22,983
[SPEAKER_03]: So as far as other ones that came out, though, it did have some predecessors, things that actually...

995
01:08:25,264 --> 01:08:29,966
[SPEAKER_03]: would inspire the game and build the groundwork for it.

996
01:08:30,046 --> 01:08:32,827
[SPEAKER_03]: There was definitely some competitors.

997
01:08:35,468 --> 01:08:40,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, Dune 2 and then Warcraft Works and Humans came out after that.

998
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:48,832
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was actually a random map generator that was for it.

999
01:08:49,512 --> 01:08:52,033
[SPEAKER_03]: And that came from Civilization Robots.

1000
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:55,801
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that you'd find that interesting.

1001
01:08:58,183 --> 01:09:08,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Command and Conquer actually borrowed from Warcraft and Age of Empires put all of them in in the random map generator when it came out.

1002
01:09:09,674 --> 01:09:16,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Modern Wars for the Commodore 64 incorporated the use of land play.

1003
01:09:18,317 --> 01:09:22,999
[SPEAKER_03]: So it really, not only was it influenced by some others, but it actually pulled influence.

1004
01:09:23,399 --> 01:09:29,241
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually even listing Realms as an old Amiga and Atari ST game as being an influence on it.

1005
01:09:31,862 --> 01:09:38,325
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course for sequels, we got Warcraft 2, Tides of Darkness in 95, and Warcraft 2 Beyond the Dark Portal in 96.

1006
01:09:38,365 --> 01:09:38,525
[SPEAKER_03]: And then...

1007
01:09:42,643 --> 01:09:46,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming out later, of course, was Warcraft 3, Reign of Chaos.

1008
01:09:47,384 --> 01:09:51,866
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was StarCraft, like I said, and StarCraft Brood War and World of Warcraft.

1009
01:09:52,386 --> 01:09:54,246
[SPEAKER_06]: And soon StarCraft 2 for URTS fans.

1010
01:09:54,306 --> 01:09:55,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was about to get to that.

1011
01:09:56,107 --> 01:09:56,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sorry.

1012
01:09:57,307 --> 01:10:00,008
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, Warcraft, you know, it's expanded.

1013
01:10:00,108 --> 01:10:02,048
[SPEAKER_03]: There's card games, comics.

1014
01:10:02,168 --> 01:10:02,969
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a ton of books.

1015
01:10:03,169 --> 01:10:04,409
[SPEAKER_03]: You've seen the books, I'm sure.

1016
01:10:05,349 --> 01:10:09,731
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually a film called Warcraft in production to be out in 2011.

1017
01:10:12,037 --> 01:10:13,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Spider-Man dude's doing it, right?

1018
01:10:14,238 --> 01:10:15,058
[SPEAKER_06]: And Army of Darkness, right?

1019
01:10:15,078 --> 01:10:17,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think there's also board games too.

1020
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:27,443
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, Warcraft really did kind of spur a whole, you know, a whole big thing.

1021
01:10:29,123 --> 01:10:31,144
[SPEAKER_06]: 11 million people can't be wrong, or can they?

1022
01:10:33,146 --> 01:10:33,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Addicts.

1023
01:10:34,106 --> 01:10:34,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Addicts!

1024
01:10:34,847 --> 01:10:36,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Your classic game of the week.

1025
01:10:36,267 --> 01:10:39,908
[SPEAKER_06]: A true classic indeed in every way, shape, and form.

1026
01:10:39,948 --> 01:10:41,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't listen to DarkSakura.

1027
01:10:41,029 --> 01:10:43,730
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not saying it's a bad game.

1028
01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:45,970
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying I don't like RTSs.

1029
01:10:47,731 --> 01:10:49,492
[SPEAKER_03]: And even, that's including ActRaiser.

1030
01:10:50,072 --> 01:10:51,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Warcraft, oh, you don't like ActRaiser?

1031
01:10:52,052 --> 01:10:53,973
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't say I don't like ActRaiser.

1032
01:10:54,533 --> 01:10:55,874
[SPEAKER_03]: ActRaiser is a good game.

1033
01:10:56,034 --> 01:10:58,815
[SPEAKER_03]: I get bored, bored, bored after a while.

1034
01:10:58,835 --> 01:10:59,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm gonna cry.

1035
01:11:00,669 --> 01:11:06,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, there's a difference between thinking something is crap and just not liking the genre of it.

1036
01:11:09,013 --> 01:11:10,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I can see that.

1037
01:11:10,173 --> 01:11:11,934
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to think if there's something I feel that way about.

1038
01:11:11,994 --> 01:11:15,035
[SPEAKER_03]: I do every so often, like, you know, smiting people in Actraiser.

1039
01:11:15,616 --> 01:11:20,217
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I would say that's how I feel about sports games, but, like, I can go back and play old school sports games, no problem.

1040
01:11:20,237 --> 01:11:24,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I love Tecmo Bowl, Blades of Steel, like, the way they used to be before they just got... Super high impact.

1041
01:11:24,659 --> 01:11:26,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, yeah, before they got, like, really complicated.

1042
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:28,961
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's my point, you know.

1043
01:11:29,681 --> 01:11:33,403
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll start playing and I'll be like, yeah, this is cool, and then I'm like, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

1044
01:11:34,663 --> 01:11:35,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Not my thing, not my thing.

1045
01:11:36,144 --> 01:11:38,266
[SPEAKER_06]: I might have liked Warcraft, but I wasn't very good at it.

1046
01:11:38,366 --> 01:11:39,547
[SPEAKER_06]: I never got very far in it.

1047
01:11:39,827 --> 01:11:42,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I'm not good at RTSs.

1048
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:46,813
[SPEAKER_03]: This whole thing, I can do the strategy just fine.

1049
01:11:46,973 --> 01:11:48,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I just get bored with it.

1050
01:11:48,174 --> 01:11:50,856
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really my thing.

1051
01:11:52,137 --> 01:11:52,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, fair enough.

1052
01:11:56,643 --> 01:12:01,146
[SPEAKER_06]: If you would like to suggest a classic game of the week, too bad, DarkSakura doesn't take suggestions.

1053
01:12:01,166 --> 01:12:02,026
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, actually.

1054
01:12:02,287 --> 01:12:03,427
[SPEAKER_06]: But you could always try the mailbag.

1055
01:12:03,728 --> 01:12:04,828
[SPEAKER_03]: I need help from the chat room.

1056
01:12:05,669 --> 01:12:10,292
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking for a PlayStation copy of NBA Jam.

1057
01:12:12,048 --> 01:12:20,330
[SPEAKER_03]: If you find it, no matter what variety of version it is for the PlayStation, first PlayStation, let me know.

1058
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:21,590
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the reason?

1059
01:12:21,790 --> 01:12:22,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan wants it.

1060
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:25,791
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's actually hard to find.

1061
01:12:26,351 --> 01:12:26,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1062
01:12:26,931 --> 01:12:27,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1063
01:12:28,551 --> 01:12:31,252
[SPEAKER_03]: We are looking to add it to the collection because we have everything else.

1064
01:12:32,812 --> 01:12:34,613
[SPEAKER_03]: We want completion for our NBA Jamage.

1065
01:12:34,733 --> 01:12:35,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom shakalaka.

1066
01:12:37,666 --> 01:12:39,088
[SPEAKER_06]: He's on fire!

1067
01:12:39,108 --> 01:12:45,717
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been seriously back there in the vault playing NBA Jam for days in a row.

1068
01:12:45,817 --> 01:12:48,580
[SPEAKER_06]: If you could find the PlayStation 1, you could play it on a PS3.

1069
01:12:49,441 --> 01:12:50,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is the cool thing.

1070
01:12:50,162 --> 01:12:53,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Because PS3s, they all have backwards compatibility no matter what one you have.

1071
01:12:53,286 --> 01:12:56,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, but we also do still have a functional PlayStation.

1072
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:56,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nice.

1073
01:12:57,848 --> 01:13:01,811
[SPEAKER_03]: That still had the IO port and everything so we can use our little clip-in thing.

1074
01:13:01,971 --> 01:13:02,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

1075
01:13:02,771 --> 01:13:03,812
[SPEAKER_03]: But I want help finding it.

1076
01:13:04,572 --> 01:13:07,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you find a... I don't want to say this on the air.

1077
01:13:07,694 --> 01:13:10,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you find a burn of it somewhere, let us know.

1078
01:13:10,735 --> 01:13:15,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Because really, we're wanting to just check it out, but we would prefer a legit copy.

1079
01:13:16,358 --> 01:13:16,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1080
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:19,261
[SPEAKER_06]: You might want to look at chat.

1081
01:13:19,301 --> 01:13:20,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody's speaking up there.

1082
01:13:20,382 --> 01:13:22,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Lama Juice says, I think I have a copy.

1083
01:13:22,724 --> 01:13:23,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there you go.

1084
01:13:23,665 --> 01:13:24,486
[SPEAKER_06]: You better go find that out.

1085
01:13:24,947 --> 01:13:25,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1086
01:13:26,288 --> 01:13:32,013
[SPEAKER_06]: If you would like to help DarkSakura out, mailbag at orangeentree.com or join our chat room right now, chat.orangeentree.com

1087
01:13:32,830 --> 01:13:35,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, that's the end of Part A, but we still have plenty more show to come.

1088
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:42,617
[SPEAKER_06]: We have more to come in Part B tonight, including some other news out of the Capcom event this week.

1089
01:13:42,657 --> 01:13:45,058
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, a lot of it we reported last week as rumors.

1090
01:13:45,098 --> 01:13:45,899
[SPEAKER_06]: They've turned to fact.

1091
01:13:46,259 --> 01:13:48,500
[SPEAKER_06]: But we do have some extra details to come with that.

1092
01:13:48,541 --> 01:13:49,581
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get into that as well.

1093
01:13:50,262 --> 01:13:52,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Some big rumored games for Xbox Live Arcade.

1094
01:13:53,504 --> 01:13:56,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Some more in the ongoing Infinity Ward saga.

1095
01:13:57,106 --> 01:14:02,630
[SPEAKER_06]: And much more coming up when we come back after a break here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1096
01:14:09,332 --> 01:14:10,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Marvel vs. Capcom News

1097
01:14:39,532 --> 01:14:44,598
[SPEAKER_06]: DRM Debate, Television on the Xbox, and plenty more news to go through this week.

1098
01:14:44,778 --> 01:14:47,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, why don't you start us off with some fast news tonight?

1099
01:14:48,902 --> 01:14:53,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, there's some WiiWare releases coming soon on May 17th.

1100
01:14:54,948 --> 01:15:17,365
[SPEAKER_07]: including the next title in the Bit.Trip series, Bit.Trip Runner will be coming out that day on WiiWare and also there's some summer DSiWare release dates as well to share including Photo Dojo which looks like a side-scrolling fighting game that uses a DSi's camera to add you to the game.

1101
01:15:18,606 --> 01:15:19,967
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of neat, I guess.

1102
01:15:20,767 --> 01:15:21,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of gimmicky, but fun.

1103
01:15:24,390 --> 01:15:33,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Earthworm Jim, coming out also on May 10th, and apparently I guess that's going to be an update to the SNES version of the game.

1104
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:39,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, another Frogger game.

1105
01:15:40,442 --> 01:15:44,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Frogger returns yet again on... People must be buying him, Loki.

1106
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:45,487
[SPEAKER_07]: They wouldn't be selling him.

1107
01:15:45,907 --> 01:15:47,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Konami has Frogger.

1108
01:15:47,749 --> 01:15:48,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Go Konami.

1109
01:15:49,811 --> 01:15:57,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Metal Torrent on May 24th is an Akira-developed shmup game.

1110
01:15:57,658 --> 01:15:58,799
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks pretty awesome.

1111
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:05,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, Xscape is, I guess, a sequel to a Game Boy title.

1112
01:16:06,824 --> 01:16:09,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, I guess, a title X from Q Games.

1113
01:16:10,907 --> 01:16:13,768
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, it's like a first-person tank combat game.

1114
01:16:14,809 --> 01:16:16,270
[SPEAKER_07]: But really trippy looking.

1115
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:19,391
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, uh, some other stuff coming out.

1116
01:16:20,132 --> 01:16:20,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1117
01:16:22,341 --> 01:16:29,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Hero of Sparta on May 31st, Flame Trail on June 7th, and A Cappas Trail on June 14th.

1118
01:16:30,649 --> 01:16:32,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Then also, another title that's going to be...

1119
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:37,611
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1120
01:16:56,278 --> 01:17:02,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Trick the user into viewing the environment in a three-dimensional fashion.

1121
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:09,041
[SPEAKER_07]: You basically tilt the screen around, and doing so will change your perspective in the game.

1122
01:17:09,421 --> 01:17:12,682
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically kind of a hidden objects game, I guess.

1123
01:17:13,282 --> 01:17:15,483
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks kind of cool, so that will be coming out as well.

1124
01:17:16,607 --> 01:17:19,408
[SPEAKER_07]: and then non-DSI related stuff.

1125
01:17:20,528 --> 01:17:32,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Battlefield Heroes is going to be getting some more upgrades in the form of jetpacks as well as some new maps and new game mode.

1126
01:17:33,892 --> 01:17:37,773
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to be getting... That's funny.

1127
01:17:38,053 --> 01:17:41,914
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot that they had the Michael Jackson content that one time.

1128
01:17:43,115 --> 01:17:43,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways...

1129
01:17:45,709 --> 01:17:58,392
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess they're going to be getting a new map called Midnight Mayhem and a new mode that's going to be called V2 Vengeance where players must capture and control a giant rocket.

1130
01:18:00,672 --> 01:18:04,593
[SPEAKER_07]: But hey, look, see they're bringing out jetpacks before Halo Reach can.

1131
01:18:07,173 --> 01:18:09,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think that's why they're doing it?

1132
01:18:11,134 --> 01:18:12,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe to get the jump on it?

1133
01:18:13,035 --> 01:18:13,455
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1134
01:18:14,675 --> 01:18:15,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to be fun.

1135
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:19,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Breakout from Atari

1136
01:18:41,110 --> 01:18:43,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Pitfall and Megamania from Activision.

1137
01:18:44,273 --> 01:18:45,434
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember Megamania.

1138
01:18:45,474 --> 01:18:47,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that a game that rings a bell to you, DarkSakura?

1139
01:18:48,176 --> 01:18:49,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Megamania by Activision.

1140
01:18:49,878 --> 01:18:51,419
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the name, I just don't remember the game.

1141
01:18:51,599 --> 01:18:52,280
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember it either.

1142
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:53,120
[SPEAKER_06]: I certainly know Pitfall.

1143
01:18:53,821 --> 01:18:55,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Night Stalker from Mattel.

1144
01:18:55,202 --> 01:18:56,223
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming that's in television.

1145
01:18:57,044 --> 01:19:01,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Rack Em Up by Konami, Real Sports Volleyball by Atari, and Basketball by Atari.

1146
01:19:02,168 --> 01:19:03,929
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are all some new game room releases.

1147
01:19:03,969 --> 01:19:06,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Certainly I think Pitfall and Breakout are probably the standouts there.

1148
01:19:07,112 --> 01:19:08,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I want to say Megamania.

1149
01:19:08,793 --> 01:19:09,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Ringing a bell.

1150
01:19:10,074 --> 01:19:11,676
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's some other stuff on Xbox Live.

1151
01:19:11,776 --> 01:19:14,918
[SPEAKER_06]: This week we had Puzzle Chronicles and Afterburner Climax.

1152
01:19:14,938 --> 01:19:17,460
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I meant to check out Puzzle Chronicles, even though it looked a little weird.

1153
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:19,781
[SPEAKER_06]: The next week is Tecmo Bowl on the 28th.

1154
01:19:19,841 --> 01:19:20,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Woohoo!

1155
01:19:21,002 --> 01:19:21,943
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty cool.

1156
01:19:22,783 --> 01:19:27,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Also some Mega Man 10 releases on the 28th.

1157
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:29,988
[SPEAKER_06]: The Endless Attack Mode and two more special stages.

1158
01:19:30,028 --> 01:19:31,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Special Stage 2 and Special Stage 3.

1159
01:19:32,650 --> 01:19:35,913
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Bioshock 2 gets the Rapture Metro Pack on April 29th.

1160
01:19:36,673 --> 01:19:40,475
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm surprised that they're even doing that, seeing as the game came out, what, two years ago?

1161
01:19:40,495 --> 01:19:40,975
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously?

1162
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:03,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Farmeville is expanding beyond Facebook.

1163
01:20:23,358 --> 01:20:28,521
[SPEAKER_06]: And this would be because of a website, I guess, that spies on domain names that people are registering.

1164
01:20:28,981 --> 01:20:40,507
[SPEAKER_06]: And Zynga, the company behind Farmville, has registered FarmvilleAndroid.com, FarmvilleiPad.com, FarmvilleiPhone.com, and FarmvilleSMS.com.

1165
01:20:40,907 --> 01:20:45,050
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are all domain names that are registered by the Farmville folks.

1166
01:20:45,670 --> 01:20:46,170
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1167
01:20:47,031 --> 01:20:50,032
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, I guess they're all also forwarding to Farmville.com.

1168
01:20:50,532 --> 01:20:51,153
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

1169
01:20:52,353 --> 01:20:56,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so needless to say, FarmVille is slowly taking over the world.

1170
01:20:56,674 --> 01:20:57,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Run while you still can.

1171
01:20:58,575 --> 01:21:01,576
[SPEAKER_06]: No further word about Fishville or any of that yet.

1172
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:05,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Also worthy of mention, there's a rare NES game called Euphoria.

1173
01:21:06,077 --> 01:21:09,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Not like EU, but U-F-O-U-R-I-A, Euphoria.

1174
01:21:09,978 --> 01:21:13,739
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been rated by the OFLC, which is the Australian Ratings Board.

1175
01:21:13,839 --> 01:21:17,420
[SPEAKER_06]: This means that a virtual console release is likely possible today.

1176
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:21,722
[SPEAKER_06]: What's interesting about this game, it's pretty rare, but it was actually done by Sunsoft.

1177
01:21:22,062 --> 01:21:26,944
[SPEAKER_06]: You might remember Sunsoft recently as kind of having like a re-arising or a re-awakening, if you'll call it.

1178
01:21:27,425 --> 01:21:29,406
[SPEAKER_06]: They put out Blaster Master on Virtual Console.

1179
01:21:29,446 --> 01:21:34,348
[SPEAKER_06]: There was that OK Blaster Master upgrade game that also hit Virtual Console.

1180
01:21:34,768 --> 01:22:01,980
[SPEAKER_06]: now apparently Euphoria the Saga is coming out as well it's a Metroidvania type of game is what they're saying it's a NES game and it stars this character you get separated from his friends and you are looking through the world for your lost companions I guess it's kind of like Goonies 2 in that regard hey actually that sounds kind of awesome Goonies 2 is kind of Metroidvania too so there you go the game was released in Europe just so you know but I don't believe it was ever released actually in the US hence why it's rare nope

1181
01:22:02,821 --> 01:22:09,401
[SPEAKER_06]: so there you go, Euphoria, possibly on Virtual Console, but usually those ratings news means, yeah, yeah, they're coming it's a cute little game

1182
01:22:09,964 --> 01:22:17,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Real quickly before Jamie takes over with some news, the chat room is again complaining that the stream had failed and I guess we blacked out for a little bit there.

1183
01:22:18,126 --> 01:22:20,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, we don't know what causes it.

1184
01:22:22,347 --> 01:22:31,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby Blackwolf wants to clarify because you guys are hearing that little bumper that says, all games is switching between it's live and on demand, then that must mean it's on our end and it's not the all games computer.

1185
01:22:31,408 --> 01:22:34,629
[SPEAKER_06]: However, we are not doing anything out of the ordinary.

1186
01:22:34,729 --> 01:22:36,369
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no one else's here but us threes.

1187
01:22:36,389 --> 01:22:38,030
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no Xbox games going on or nothing.

1188
01:22:38,430 --> 01:22:39,110
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can thank

1189
01:22:39,770 --> 01:22:41,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie's lovely internet provider.

1190
01:22:42,093 --> 01:22:42,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Comcast.

1191
01:22:43,515 --> 01:22:44,396
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Comcastic.

1192
01:22:44,696 --> 01:22:47,019
[SPEAKER_06]: They were a wonderful shade of crap this morning.

1193
01:22:47,059 --> 01:22:47,499
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1194
01:22:47,579 --> 01:22:49,922
[SPEAKER_06]: My Warcraft has been going down, too, in the area.

1195
01:22:49,962 --> 01:22:51,284
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know what?

1196
01:22:51,344 --> 01:22:52,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody's running porn.

1197
01:22:53,086 --> 01:22:54,007
[SPEAKER_06]: We did a porn check.

1198
01:22:54,888 --> 01:22:55,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything's fine.

1199
01:22:56,370 --> 01:22:58,192
[SPEAKER_06]: We gotta keep on rolling with the show.

1200
01:22:58,272 --> 01:22:58,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, guys.

1201
01:23:00,214 --> 01:23:04,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, by the way, I do want to clarify that specifically it is tournament edition.

1202
01:23:05,139 --> 01:23:07,821
[SPEAKER_03]: NBA Jam tournament edition for PlayStation that I'm looking for.

1203
01:23:08,822 --> 01:23:09,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1204
01:23:09,423 --> 01:23:12,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there's some on Amazon, but Dan hasn't told me I can buy it yet.

1205
01:23:13,527 --> 01:23:15,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, broadband updates.

1206
01:23:15,549 --> 01:23:18,291
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some new tracks coming out.

1207
01:23:19,612 --> 01:23:22,856
[SPEAKER_03]: There is Busted, Thunderbirds Are Go for $160.

1208
01:23:25,518 --> 01:23:41,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Microsoft Points and 200 Wii Points Flyleaf again and Silverchair tomorrow I don't see anything about an actual pack just the three tracks also somebody finally beat Castlevania with a DDR pad

1209
01:23:44,615 --> 01:24:03,120
[SPEAKER_03]: The old school Castlevania, like the first one, this dude named Nick Hagman played the Virtual Console original Castlevania using a DDR Mario Mixed Controller and it took 62 lives in more than 4 hours, but he did it.

1210
01:24:03,260 --> 01:24:07,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait a minute, I'm looking at the YouTube here of the guy, I guess, who did it here.

1211
01:24:07,222 --> 01:24:08,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see if we can fast forward.

1212
01:24:08,083 --> 01:24:09,404
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to hear his little monologue.

1213
01:24:09,424 --> 01:24:10,384
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to see him play.

1214
01:24:11,045 --> 01:24:15,147
[SPEAKER_06]: And it looks like he's... Is he really stepping around, or is he just kind of like... I think he's sitting.

1215
01:24:15,868 --> 01:24:18,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, in some pictures, he's just sitting, kind of using his hands.

1216
01:24:18,549 --> 01:24:21,051
[SPEAKER_06]: But now in this YouTube, I'm looking where he's fighting Dracula.

1217
01:24:21,651 --> 01:24:23,913
[SPEAKER_06]: He is actually using his feet to do it.

1218
01:24:24,333 --> 01:24:24,573
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

1219
01:24:26,314 --> 01:24:31,718
[SPEAKER_06]: because I was going to criticize this a little bit if he was actually just sitting there kind of hitting the buttons, but apparently he's actually dancing around.

1220
01:24:32,078 --> 01:24:35,841
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if this kid lost weight doing it, although he looks pretty skinny to begin with.

1221
01:24:38,643 --> 01:24:38,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1222
01:24:39,263 --> 01:24:41,605
[SPEAKER_06]: I slayed Pounce and Dracula.

1223
01:24:42,305 --> 01:24:43,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations, I guess.

1224
01:24:44,767 --> 01:24:45,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay for you.

1225
01:24:46,268 --> 01:24:47,789
[SPEAKER_07]: You have more time than I do.

1226
01:24:48,149 --> 01:24:48,950
[SPEAKER_03]: A winner, it's you.

1227
01:24:51,435 --> 01:24:53,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Marvel vs. Capcom comic books

1228
01:25:09,183 --> 01:25:11,685
[SPEAKER_03]: The Adventures of Deadpool and Dan

1229
01:25:37,625 --> 01:25:51,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Deadpool and Dan The actual Dan is here to say something Disney vs. Capcom Disney vs. Capcom I want Deadpool and Dan How would that work?

1230
01:25:51,312 --> 01:25:54,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Deadpool and Dan Alright

1231
01:25:57,059 --> 01:25:57,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Show us your tweets.

1232
01:26:16,829 --> 01:26:17,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's the tweets?

1233
01:26:17,550 --> 01:26:17,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.

1234
01:26:18,070 --> 01:26:22,955
[SPEAKER_06]: TheShadowSniper sent us some tweets saying, I'm unable to listen live because I work late Sundays.

1235
01:26:23,375 --> 01:26:25,037
[SPEAKER_06]: I do carry around my Blackberry.

1236
01:26:25,097 --> 01:26:27,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it possible to listen live through my phone?

1237
01:26:27,939 --> 01:26:35,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, unfortunately, we know of an iPod app, an iTouch app, and I guess it runs on the iPad, so iEverything app.

1238
01:26:35,986 --> 01:27:03,024
[SPEAKER_06]: that's the all games radio app if you just search for all games or allgames.com in the iTunes store that's a great way to listen unfortunately you're asking about the Blackberry my advice would be get one of those there's got to be like a radio tuner type app depending if your Blackberry has apps you would actually be able to tune into the feed directly it's just a shoutcast feed so any feed that will do shoutcast streams you can listen to all games radio on so check that out

1239
01:27:04,065 --> 01:27:11,170
[SPEAKER_06]: TheShadowSniper also asks, what game ending is your favorite because of its twist ending or its great conclusion?

1240
01:27:11,210 --> 01:27:14,052
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a good topic I don't think we've talked about in a very long time.

1241
01:27:14,433 --> 01:27:16,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Favorite video game ending, DarkSakura?

1242
01:27:17,435 --> 01:27:17,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?

1243
01:27:18,076 --> 01:27:19,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Favorite video game ending?

1244
01:27:19,217 --> 01:27:20,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Favorite video game ending.

1245
01:27:20,417 --> 01:27:21,198
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a twist?

1246
01:27:21,859 --> 01:27:22,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Doesn't have to be.

1247
01:27:22,899 --> 01:27:26,823
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, what was your favorite because of its twist or great conclusion?

1248
01:27:26,883 --> 01:27:26,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1249
01:27:29,568 --> 01:27:30,248
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know.

1250
01:27:30,829 --> 01:27:31,609
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really think I have one.

1251
01:27:31,629 --> 01:27:33,551
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I loved all the million endings for Chrono Trigger.

1252
01:27:34,331 --> 01:27:35,512
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that goes without saying.

1253
01:27:36,353 --> 01:27:39,214
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved the multiple endings for Symphony of the Night.

1254
01:27:40,455 --> 01:27:42,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, Richter's dead.

1255
01:27:42,297 --> 01:27:44,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, he was controlled by Shaft.

1256
01:27:45,439 --> 01:27:45,759
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.

1257
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:52,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say that my favorite ending is Maria's ending from Dracula X.

1258
01:27:53,700 --> 01:28:00,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Where she's walking along with her little happy mamba music and all of her little animal buddies are following her along.

1259
01:28:01,245 --> 01:28:03,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because that really goes with the Castlevania game.

1260
01:28:05,248 --> 01:28:05,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki?

1261
01:28:06,469 --> 01:28:08,130
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the ending to Final Fantasy VI.

1262
01:28:10,692 --> 01:28:16,015
[SPEAKER_06]: I was kind of going to go along those lines too and say Final Fantasy 4 was actually my favorite ending.

1263
01:28:16,035 --> 01:28:18,176
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like a 20 minute epic ending back in the day.

1264
01:28:18,736 --> 01:28:19,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Good stuff.

1265
01:28:19,496 --> 01:28:20,577
[SPEAKER_06]: That was one of my favorite endings.

1266
01:28:21,798 --> 01:28:26,500
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as like a twist ending, I'm trying to remember games that had like a twist that made me go like, oh my gosh.

1267
01:28:28,121 --> 01:28:28,421
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1268
01:28:28,441 --> 01:28:30,642
[SPEAKER_06]: For some reason I'm not thinking of any off the top of my head right now.

1269
01:28:31,563 --> 01:28:34,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus, you have to remember I have gamer ADD so I don't beat a lot of video games.

1270
01:28:34,984 --> 01:28:37,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I play them for about an hour and then I'm like, ooh, shiny.

1271
01:28:37,325 --> 01:28:38,826
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go play something else.

1272
01:28:39,547 --> 01:28:39,687
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

1273
01:28:40,547 --> 01:28:56,447
[SPEAKER_06]: but yeah you know the Final Fantasy series is always dependable for good endings I think those are definitely up there so alright also I always love the endings in Street Fighter 2 the little stories that were just so random and you know those were always favorites of mine too

1274
01:28:57,488 --> 01:29:05,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, let's see, SpazinatorPSN says, I can't exactly say when, but hopefully if all goes well, down the time I anticipate some epic news.

1275
01:29:06,554 --> 01:29:07,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you can't just leave it at that.

1276
01:29:07,954 --> 01:29:09,475
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta say what the epic news is.

1277
01:29:10,876 --> 01:29:16,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Tigerclaw gives us like a ton of gaming links, and we don't have time to read them all.

1278
01:29:16,079 --> 01:29:17,280
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, it's kind of a lot.

1279
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:18,661
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a lot of Twitter topics tonight.

1280
01:29:19,121 --> 01:29:20,582
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'll read at least a couple of these here.

1281
01:29:21,142 --> 01:29:21,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1282
01:29:22,643 --> 01:29:27,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Yosho Inori Ono says, ask Capcom if you want another Darkstalkers game.

1283
01:29:40,658 --> 01:29:41,379
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1284
01:29:58,016 --> 01:30:06,001
[SPEAKER_06]: So, anyhow, he says that he always tries to talk about Darkstalkers in interviews, and he wants to show Capcom that there's a demand for a new game.

1285
01:30:06,061 --> 01:30:09,303
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, quote, I am desperate to make this game.

1286
01:30:10,243 --> 01:30:11,484
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a pretty bold statement.

1287
01:30:11,904 --> 01:30:14,286
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, flood Capcom with your letters.

1288
01:30:14,546 --> 01:30:21,790
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, when you're going to send your hate mail about their DRM, you might want to just send some postcards to it and say, oh, by the way, PS, new Darkstalkers, please.

1289
01:30:22,791 --> 01:30:24,052
[SPEAKER_06]: But don't screw it up with DRM.

1290
01:30:24,172 --> 01:30:24,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you dare.

1291
01:30:27,642 --> 01:30:31,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony is going to be discontinuing the 3.5 inch floppy disk in Japan I want a box of them

1292
01:30:46,014 --> 01:30:47,535
[SPEAKER_06]: To make something out of them.

1293
01:31:06,491 --> 01:31:11,114
[SPEAKER_06]: They were first introduced in 1981 and really sold broad in Japan in 1983.

1294
01:31:12,314 --> 01:31:24,061
[SPEAKER_06]: They had their peak in the year 2000, but as you can probably imagine, now that you have USB drives and CDs and other types of storage mediums, whatever happened to zip drives?

1295
01:31:24,721 --> 01:31:26,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, zip drives are going to be like the next big thing.

1296
01:31:26,842 --> 01:31:29,464
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have like three zip disks around here somewhere.

1297
01:31:29,784 --> 01:31:31,725
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a zip drive, or I had a zip drive.

1298
01:31:32,513 --> 01:31:33,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember the zip drive?

1299
01:31:33,954 --> 01:31:35,215
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I used to download stuff with.

1300
01:31:35,395 --> 01:31:37,176
[SPEAKER_03]: I make my portable drive.

1301
01:31:37,916 --> 01:31:38,777
[SPEAKER_06]: So there it is.

1302
01:31:38,857 --> 01:31:40,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye, three-and-a-half-inch sloppy.

1303
01:31:41,238 --> 01:31:43,359
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like when they got rid of the Polaroids, man.

1304
01:31:43,379 --> 01:31:44,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember when that happened?

1305
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:45,400
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1306
01:31:46,601 --> 01:31:46,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1307
01:31:47,021 --> 01:31:47,421
[SPEAKER_06]: One other one.

1308
01:31:47,461 --> 01:31:50,643
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give Tigerclaw one more story because I'm nice and he gave a lot.

1309
01:31:51,304 --> 01:31:57,427
[SPEAKER_06]: He also sent us a link to a story about early 3D games on PS3 featured downgraded graphics.

1310
01:31:58,287 --> 01:32:00,208
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a story he linked us to on Kotaku.

1311
01:32:00,228 --> 01:32:01,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

1312
01:32:01,189 --> 01:32:03,651
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a whole other thing we should get into at some point tonight.

1313
01:32:03,671 --> 01:32:07,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you hear about the whole Gawker Media who owns Kotaku?

1314
01:32:08,174 --> 01:32:09,435
[SPEAKER_06]: One of their other little websites.

1315
01:32:09,455 --> 01:32:12,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you hear about this whole mess about the iPhone that was found at the bar?

1316
01:32:12,296 --> 01:32:12,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1317
01:32:12,637 --> 01:32:17,340
[SPEAKER_06]: And this company that bought it for like $5,000 or something like that and leaked all the information on it.

1318
01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:19,281
[SPEAKER_06]: And now they want it back.

1319
01:32:19,741 --> 01:32:20,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they got it back.

1320
01:32:21,363 --> 01:32:21,943
[SPEAKER_06]: What a mess.

1321
01:32:22,083 --> 01:32:22,864
[SPEAKER_03]: In pieces, right?

1322
01:32:23,184 --> 01:32:24,905
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that'd be $5,000, please.

1323
01:32:25,585 --> 01:32:26,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they probably put it back together.

1324
01:32:28,387 --> 01:32:30,589
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, that was a sister blog to Kotaku, so...

1325
01:32:32,307 --> 01:32:33,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't know.

1326
01:32:33,568 --> 01:32:37,569
[SPEAKER_06]: There's more I could say on it, but I'm kind of getting to the point where I just don't care.

1327
01:32:37,830 --> 01:32:39,150
[SPEAKER_06]: It happened, whatever.

1328
01:32:39,730 --> 01:32:42,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, fourth generation iPhone?

1329
01:32:42,192 --> 01:32:42,512
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

1330
01:32:42,732 --> 01:32:43,172
[SPEAKER_06]: What?!

1331
01:32:44,092 --> 01:32:47,054
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think the way it all went... That is so surprising.

1332
01:32:47,874 --> 01:32:50,896
[SPEAKER_06]: The way it all went down was a little bit, I don't know the word, I think tacky.

1333
01:32:51,956 --> 01:32:56,338
[SPEAKER_06]: The one that really rubbed me the wrong way was the story they ran on the guy who lost it.

1334
01:32:57,198 --> 01:32:57,739
[SPEAKER_06]: You know...

1335
01:32:59,229 --> 01:33:00,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, look what I brought with me I'm so drunk

1336
01:33:26,306 --> 01:33:33,836
[SPEAKER_06]: does it necessitate him being splashed all over this blog and all the details about his Facebook and all this stuff it's tacky, it's just tacky

1337
01:33:35,740 --> 01:33:45,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so Tacky Website Sister reports that PS3 apparently might have some downgraded graphics.

1338
01:33:45,144 --> 01:33:50,607
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess Wipeout HD usually will run in 1080p, which is considered, you know, it's the Uber HD.

1339
01:33:51,307 --> 01:33:56,189
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to actually be scaled back to 720p to run in 3D.

1340
01:33:56,289 --> 01:33:59,030
[SPEAKER_06]: MotorStorm, its top resolution was 720p.

1341
01:33:59,351 --> 01:34:04,393
[SPEAKER_06]: It actually has to be scaled back to less than that, which would not even be considered HD, in order to run in HD.

1342
01:34:06,034 --> 01:34:08,775
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not true.

1343
01:34:08,895 --> 01:34:09,916
[SPEAKER_07]: No, less than that.

1344
01:34:09,996 --> 01:34:10,876
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not considered HD.

1345
01:34:10,936 --> 01:34:14,758
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically pulling a Halo where they just up-res everything.

1346
01:34:16,379 --> 01:34:18,240
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not true HD.

1347
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:23,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't Sony the same company that marched out there and said, we have true HD on all of our games?

1348
01:34:23,683 --> 01:34:26,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, just like all of our games are going to be 1080p running at 120 frames per second.

1349
01:34:26,405 --> 01:34:27,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Smoke goes towards my ass.

1350
01:34:27,125 --> 01:34:27,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1351
01:34:34,429 --> 01:34:43,356
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not surprising that they're going to have to cut down the graphics a little bit, but I don't think you're going to really notice when everything's flying towards you.

1352
01:34:44,257 --> 01:34:50,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, it's going to take more processing power to display those images.

1353
01:34:50,341 --> 01:34:52,323
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to have to refresh twice as fast.

1354
01:34:54,099 --> 01:34:55,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever, I'm so over 3D.

1355
01:34:56,499 --> 01:34:57,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, fuck 3D.

1356
01:34:57,740 --> 01:34:58,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

1357
01:34:58,600 --> 01:34:59,300
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm over it.

1358
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:00,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, now it's just like everything.

1359
01:35:00,620 --> 01:35:05,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Every fucking movie's in 3D, and every game's gonna be redone in 3D.

1360
01:35:05,201 --> 01:35:07,261
[SPEAKER_06]: 3D this, 3D that, 3DS.

1361
01:35:07,621 --> 01:35:08,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck 3D.

1362
01:35:08,762 --> 01:35:09,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck it.

1363
01:35:11,962 --> 01:35:12,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Blue Swim.

1364
01:35:12,442 --> 01:35:13,802
[SPEAKER_06]: You're gonna get a 3DS.

1365
01:35:15,343 --> 01:35:15,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

1366
01:35:16,343 --> 01:35:16,803
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1367
01:35:17,043 --> 01:35:18,723
[SPEAKER_06]: If it hurts my eyes, I don't know.

1368
01:35:19,523 --> 01:35:20,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I have one.

1369
01:35:20,444 --> 01:35:22,384
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Virtual Boy, and it gave me a migraine.

1370
01:35:23,792 --> 01:35:24,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, moving on.

1371
01:35:24,753 --> 01:35:32,958
[SPEAKER_06]: BlueSwim on our Twitter sent us a tweet that says, Any thoughts on the new DDR game coming out for the 360 later this year that features Coldplay and Jordan Sparks?

1372
01:35:33,378 --> 01:35:34,499
[SPEAKER_06]: And then links us to the thing.

1373
01:35:34,899 --> 01:35:36,100
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought this game was coming out last year.

1374
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:37,201
[SPEAKER_06]: What happened to the last DDR game?

1375
01:35:37,221 --> 01:35:39,583
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that was going to be last year's DDR game.

1376
01:35:39,623 --> 01:35:40,163
[SPEAKER_06]: What happened?

1377
01:35:40,463 --> 01:35:41,564
[SPEAKER_06]: It got delayed a year?

1378
01:35:42,405 --> 01:35:43,645
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a new DDR game.

1379
01:35:43,705 --> 01:35:45,467
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still that last one that hasn't come out yet.

1380
01:35:45,687 --> 01:35:46,867
[SPEAKER_07]: The one that was at last E3.

1381
01:35:46,908 --> 01:35:53,412
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, we're just going to call it Dance Dance Revolution because that's not confusing at all.

1382
01:35:55,727 --> 01:36:17,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Blue Swim, it's really hard to say until we see the game in motion I mean, I can look at the song list and go, meh, whatever But I really want to see if they finally took the advice of, you know, just rebuild the game from the ground up It sounds like they might have, because it's supposed to have all these new modes and stuff But I'm not going to hold my breath, let me put it that way I'm kind of over DDR, so it's going to take a lot to bring me back

1383
01:36:19,355 --> 01:36:26,660
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that's a sad thing for me to say, but I guess even a new Beatmania 2DX game was announced this week, and I was just kind of like, eh, whoopee.

1384
01:36:28,621 --> 01:36:29,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoopee.

1385
01:36:30,582 --> 01:36:35,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, DarkTetsuya sends us a tweet that says, I found this on the LaMulana WeWear blog.

1386
01:36:35,606 --> 01:36:38,447
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an interesting article about religion in video games.

1387
01:36:39,028 --> 01:36:39,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

1388
01:36:40,329 --> 01:36:41,870
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's see what this is all about.

1389
01:36:41,950 --> 01:36:43,551
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going into the...

1390
01:36:56,208 --> 01:36:59,970
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the difficult things when Japanese make games for foreign countries is the problems with faith.

1391
01:37:00,411 --> 01:37:03,213
[SPEAKER_06]: From the historical background of Japan, the interest in faith has been weak.

1392
01:37:03,673 --> 01:37:11,398
[SPEAKER_06]: It's difficult to understand the feeling of things such as making vows with a hand over the Bible during the presidential inauguration or how Islamic faith views the absolute moral.

1393
01:37:11,978 --> 01:37:13,660
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to briefly explain the view of faith in Japan

1394
01:37:29,258 --> 01:37:29,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1395
01:37:47,549 --> 01:37:50,491
[SPEAKER_06]: And the faith born from within the continent's culture exists a god.

1396
01:37:50,891 --> 01:38:00,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though there is a difference between monotheism and polytheism, thinking about the many existing fears, living beyond a vast continent and harness of nature could have brought forth the absolute existence.

1397
01:38:01,498 --> 01:38:05,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Da da da goes on to talk about the do not waste philosophy and so on.

1398
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:10,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Meaning there is no harm meant when Japanese games add elements from the beliefs of foreign countries.

1399
01:38:10,703 --> 01:38:36,100
[SPEAKER_06]: and it can't just end there so what's okay and what's bad needs to be thought out because there's no such rule existing what's the best is to have the world's religionist check but that would not be possible so it's just kind of interesting to read this blog kind of talking about you know these guys having to consider this and all the development of La Mulana when you know it's maybe not such a big deal in some parts of the world but they've got to be careful not to offend because everything's got to be politically correct so

1400
01:38:37,665 --> 01:38:43,146
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to check that out, la-mulana.com slash en for the English one.

1401
01:38:43,586 --> 01:38:46,067
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is called Problem of Faith.

1402
01:38:46,207 --> 01:38:47,907
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll link it to you guys in the chat.

1403
01:38:48,347 --> 01:38:54,608
[SPEAKER_06]: But those of you listening to the podcast, la-mulana.com slash en for the English version.

1404
01:38:55,149 --> 01:38:55,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1405
01:38:56,589 --> 01:38:57,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Last couple tweets here.

1406
01:38:57,509 --> 01:38:59,409
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we got to close up the Twitter.

1407
01:39:00,390 --> 01:39:03,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Alex P. Carson on Twitter says, 364 episodes.

1408
01:39:03,810 --> 01:39:04,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Not bad.

1409
01:39:04,330 --> 01:39:06,291
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are my second favorite podcast.

1410
01:39:07,302 --> 01:39:08,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Second favorite?

1411
01:39:09,084 --> 01:39:09,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Second favorite?

1412
01:39:10,685 --> 01:39:11,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Want to guess who we lose to?

1413
01:39:12,267 --> 01:39:12,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Who?

1414
01:39:13,207 --> 01:39:13,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Dignation.

1415
01:39:15,509 --> 01:39:15,790
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

1416
01:39:16,650 --> 01:39:18,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob's going to have a diva stomp.

1417
01:39:18,232 --> 01:39:19,493
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just going to have to try harder.

1418
01:39:19,873 --> 01:39:21,094
[SPEAKER_06]: But he says keep up the good work.

1419
01:39:21,194 --> 01:39:22,115
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm all joking.

1420
01:39:22,395 --> 01:39:23,156
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, whatever.

1421
01:39:23,496 --> 01:39:25,879
[SPEAKER_06]: I can say I've never listened to an episode of that show, so I don't know.

1422
01:39:25,899 --> 01:39:27,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they're awesome and I just don't know.

1423
01:39:28,013 --> 01:39:32,535
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, well, Kevin... Yeah, I know who's on it, but does that make me care anymore?

1424
01:39:32,555 --> 01:39:32,595
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1425
01:39:32,815 --> 01:39:33,975
[SPEAKER_03]: This is so hard to read.

1426
01:39:34,555 --> 01:39:34,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1427
01:39:35,456 --> 01:39:37,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, because it's a translate thing.

1428
01:39:37,396 --> 01:39:38,497
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a Google Translate.

1429
01:39:38,997 --> 01:39:42,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I hope that's all it is, just because it's just kerned badly.

1430
01:39:43,078 --> 01:39:50,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's developed by Japanese, obviously, so it's just probably run through the Google Translate.

1431
01:39:50,821 --> 01:39:55,003
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Spazinator sends a last tweet saying, Sorry, I'm nixing the epic news.

1432
01:39:55,143 --> 01:39:58,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well, I know something you don't know.

1433
01:39:58,465 --> 01:39:58,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind.

1434
01:40:01,869 --> 01:40:02,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

1435
01:40:03,391 --> 01:40:04,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on with some more gaming news.

1436
01:40:04,953 --> 01:40:07,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we're going to get to our Skype line a little later in the show.

1437
01:40:07,296 --> 01:40:09,098
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OL-LARB.

1438
01:40:09,158 --> 01:40:09,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Not yet.

1439
01:40:09,518 --> 01:40:13,062
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got some more gaming news and mailbag and all that fun stuff.

1440
01:40:13,102 --> 01:40:15,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, why don't you get us back to gaming news?

1441
01:40:15,705 --> 01:40:15,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1442
01:40:15,926 --> 01:40:21,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, one of the things that was announced, I want to say Tokyo Game Show, WOMAC.

1443
01:40:22,453 --> 01:40:49,660
[SPEAKER_07]: was that for Dead Rising 2 they're going to be doing some sort of different things other than the last game of course one of them being co-op in the game and in fact they are going to allow you to play through the entire single player campaign with another person which is awesome and really the way they should have done it in the first place and then also let's see here

1444
01:40:50,907 --> 01:40:53,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, and then that disappeared for some reason.

1445
01:40:53,593 --> 01:40:54,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Go Comcast.

1446
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:03,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Now the other player that you play as, I'm not sure if it's, I guess it's a clone of your own character.

1447
01:41:04,266 --> 01:41:07,788
[SPEAKER_07]: They're both Chuck Green, not some other character that you play as.

1448
01:41:08,208 --> 01:41:10,670
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's going to be pretty awesome.

1449
01:41:10,710 --> 01:41:12,952
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're going to have some different mini-games you can play as well.

1450
01:41:13,973 --> 01:41:20,377
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say there's like card playing and different events and stuff that you can do.

1451
01:41:22,367 --> 01:41:30,315
[SPEAKER_07]: But hey, that's pretty sweet that they're going to have something other than just like that deathmatch American Gladiator-esque mode in the game.

1452
01:41:30,776 --> 01:41:32,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I gotta admit, co-op sounds kind of rad.

1453
01:41:32,998 --> 01:41:34,099
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm looking forward to that.

1454
01:41:34,740 --> 01:41:35,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1455
01:41:35,741 --> 01:41:39,104
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, and then one of the other things I saw too, um...

1456
01:41:41,003 --> 01:41:48,028
[SPEAKER_07]: They were talking a little bit about the demo slash prequel game that they're going to be putting out.

1457
01:41:48,048 --> 01:41:51,970
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say, what was it called?

1458
01:41:55,293 --> 01:41:55,813
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember.

1459
01:41:55,833 --> 01:42:05,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, that should be coming out pretty soon, I would think, because I think Dead Rising 2, if I remember correctly, is scheduled for August right now.

1460
01:42:07,168 --> 01:42:12,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, right now, but we just heard about a bunch of other games getting pushed back, so maybe these games will get pushed back too.

1461
01:42:12,770 --> 01:42:17,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, maybe, but Capcom usually doesn't move stuff around too much.

1462
01:42:18,572 --> 01:42:19,212
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see what happens.

1463
01:42:19,832 --> 01:42:21,153
[SPEAKER_07]: God, I just can't wait to play the game, though.

1464
01:42:21,913 --> 01:42:26,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the more and more I'm hearing about it, the more it sounds kind of awesome, even if Frank West isn't in it after all.

1465
01:42:27,835 --> 01:42:30,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it'd be funny if he made a cameo.

1466
01:42:30,416 --> 01:42:32,657
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you never know.

1467
01:42:33,077 --> 01:42:35,438
[SPEAKER_07]: They're saying that he's not in it now, but I mean...

1468
01:42:37,170 --> 01:42:40,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Bionic Commando Re-Arm 2 Re-Design Re-Build

1469
01:43:02,985 --> 01:43:06,687
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess the big thing now is that he can actually, like, jump.

1470
01:43:07,167 --> 01:43:07,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Now.

1471
01:43:09,228 --> 01:43:10,169
[SPEAKER_03]: That takes up the point.

1472
01:43:11,049 --> 01:43:13,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so now he can jump and use the arm.

1473
01:43:14,471 --> 01:43:15,011
[SPEAKER_06]: So there it is.

1474
01:43:15,051 --> 01:43:17,792
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the big change in Bionic Commando Rearmed 2.

1475
01:43:18,613 --> 01:43:21,694
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live the first quarter of 2011.

1476
01:43:23,595 --> 01:43:25,716
[SPEAKER_06]: New weapons, attacks, and all that fun stuff.

1477
01:43:26,016 --> 01:43:27,837
[SPEAKER_06]: It's being developed by Fatshark.

1478
01:43:27,937 --> 01:43:29,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, Grin did the first one, right?

1479
01:43:29,958 --> 01:43:31,259
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're not there anymore.

1480
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:56,121
[SPEAKER_06]: New physics based puzzles, there will actually be a two player co-op in this game as well New graphics, new score, but it will be inspired by NES Which kind of brings me back to what makes this game very interesting in the first place Bionic Commando Rearmed was an upgrade of an actual NES game that existed called Bionic Commando So this is a sequel to a retro remake that isn't based off anything

1481
01:43:57,121 --> 01:43:57,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that weird?

1482
01:43:57,962 --> 01:43:59,763
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it's not based off anything.

1483
01:43:59,803 --> 01:44:03,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the stuff reminded me of the arcade game by Commando.

1484
01:44:04,027 --> 01:44:07,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't there a rumored sequel in development too that just didn't end up happening?

1485
01:44:08,190 --> 01:44:13,093
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say I had read a while ago that there was a rumored sequel in development, so maybe some of this is bits and pieces of that.

1486
01:44:13,554 --> 01:44:20,499
[SPEAKER_06]: But still, the point remains, you have a sequel to a retro game that doesn't actually exist, which I find very interesting.

1487
01:44:21,308 --> 01:44:21,348
[SPEAKER_06]: X-10

1488
01:44:49,574 --> 01:44:49,874
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura

1489
01:45:03,678 --> 01:45:05,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Jet Set Radio Jet Set Radio

1490
01:45:22,148 --> 01:45:35,917
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be, it could not be, it could have just been a placeholder by someone wanting to... You know, because Sonic 4 Episode 1 is on the list, but other stuff like Quake Arena Arcade, Xenoclash... That's real.

1491
01:45:36,358 --> 01:45:36,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1492
01:45:36,978 --> 01:45:37,338
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's real?

1493
01:45:37,739 --> 01:45:38,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's real.

1494
01:45:38,359 --> 01:45:46,905
[SPEAKER_07]: It's off of... That's the PartnerNet stuff, some of which has already been leaking online, and they're cracking down on it pretty big, so...

1495
01:45:47,660 --> 01:45:48,661
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, it's in French.

1496
01:45:49,422 --> 01:45:52,084
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's the same guys that released information.

1497
01:45:53,045 --> 01:46:06,757
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if it's the same person, but those same games had screenshots leaked out because someone has a dev kit that they bought and they're releasing a bunch of screenshots and stuff from games that haven't been announced yet or aren't released yet.

1498
01:46:06,777 --> 01:46:07,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Naughty, naughty.

1499
01:46:07,958 --> 01:46:13,243
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's a few of them, they actually leaked out the full games out there, so...

1500
01:46:15,444 --> 01:46:22,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but people keep going, okay, release Sonic 4.

1501
01:46:22,169 --> 01:46:23,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, come on, you know you want it.

1502
01:46:23,950 --> 01:46:30,974
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're like, no, because they're cracking down on it and now they're password protecting a bunch of this stuff and they don't like that too much.

1503
01:46:31,214 --> 01:46:37,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, I can imagine, but... Well, yeah, it's not meant for that kind of stuff.

1504
01:46:38,339 --> 01:46:41,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Dev kits getting sold to random people.

1505
01:46:41,721 --> 01:46:42,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1506
01:46:42,768 --> 01:46:44,468
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what exactly that takes, but you can find them.

1507
01:46:44,528 --> 01:46:44,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

1508
01:47:07,662 --> 01:47:08,242
[SPEAKER_07]: JTAG Consoles

1509
01:47:29,426 --> 01:47:40,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, there's some other interesting stuff coming out from the Captivate stuff, including... These are some games that I believe were already out in Japan that are making their way out over here.

1510
01:47:41,997 --> 01:47:45,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Okamiden is coming out on the DS later this year.

1511
01:47:46,061 --> 01:47:47,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, actually, I'm sorry, in 2011.

1512
01:47:48,062 --> 01:47:50,885
[SPEAKER_07]: And, of course, that's the sequel to Okami.

1513
01:47:53,047 --> 01:47:54,088
[SPEAKER_07]: And it looks pretty awesome.

1514
01:47:54,908 --> 01:47:55,609
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course...

1515
01:47:57,688 --> 01:48:21,674
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if it's the creators of the Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney series but at least the same artists they're releasing Ghost Trick Phantom Detective that's going to be a brand new series and that's supposed to be making its way out later this year

1516
01:48:22,854 --> 01:48:29,819
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, oddly enough, on the Wii and the PS3, Sengoku Basara Samurai Heroes is making its way out.

1517
01:48:30,159 --> 01:48:32,380
[SPEAKER_07]: And I believe that's supposed to be later this year.

1518
01:48:35,302 --> 01:48:41,806
[SPEAKER_07]: And that one came out, well, one of the games in the series came out on the PlayStation 2 a couple years back.

1519
01:48:43,467 --> 01:48:50,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Which was, god, I just had the name, Devil Hunter, I think?

1520
01:48:53,001 --> 01:48:53,441
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember.

1521
01:48:54,042 --> 01:48:57,223
[SPEAKER_07]: But I thought that was the name of the series that came out over here.

1522
01:48:57,464 --> 01:49:01,626
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically like Dynasty Warriors but with guns.

1523
01:49:03,927 --> 01:49:04,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

1524
01:49:04,507 --> 01:49:04,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Guns.

1525
01:49:05,488 --> 01:49:05,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1526
01:49:06,028 --> 01:49:06,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really though.

1527
01:49:06,528 --> 01:49:06,949
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate guns.

1528
01:49:07,609 --> 01:49:14,013
[SPEAKER_07]: They've had at least one other Sengoku Basara game that was Basara I guess.

1529
01:49:14,293 --> 01:49:17,514
[SPEAKER_07]: A game that was on the Wii a while back.

1530
01:49:17,755 --> 01:49:20,116
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say it was the first or second year the Wii was out.

1531
01:49:23,667 --> 01:49:24,627
[SPEAKER_07]: They're kind of cool.

1532
01:49:25,007 --> 01:49:25,287
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1533
01:49:27,308 --> 01:49:28,388
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wish they was on the 360 too.

1534
01:49:28,488 --> 01:49:30,869
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't understand why they hate.

1535
01:49:31,489 --> 01:49:40,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless it's going to be coming out at a time when they do have the motion controller in play and it's going to be something with that and then maybe I can understand why it's on the Wii and the PS3.

1536
01:49:40,332 --> 01:49:42,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than that, it's just hating.

1537
01:49:43,292 --> 01:49:43,973
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just hateful.

1538
01:49:44,533 --> 01:49:45,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Why they hate?

1539
01:49:46,273 --> 01:49:46,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Why I gotta hate?

1540
01:49:47,113 --> 01:49:48,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't hate the play, I hate the game.

1541
01:49:50,293 --> 01:49:55,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, this is a game that I tried to like, but it kind of drove me bonkers.

1542
01:49:56,017 --> 01:49:57,858
[SPEAKER_06]: But we had a little tidbit on it last week.

1543
01:49:57,918 --> 01:50:01,441
[SPEAKER_06]: It's The Lord of Ultima, and it was actually released this week.

1544
01:50:01,521 --> 01:50:05,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay, it was launched, and you can actually play it and have fun with it.

1545
01:50:05,303 --> 01:50:08,886
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to visit the website, which I think was like lordofultima.com.

1546
01:50:09,766 --> 01:50:11,307
[SPEAKER_06]: You can actually go and play the game.

1547
01:50:11,447 --> 01:50:14,069
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried to play it, and it crashed on me during the tutorial.

1548
01:50:15,030 --> 01:50:15,770
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

1549
01:50:15,890 --> 01:50:16,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1550
01:50:17,051 --> 01:50:32,804
[SPEAKER_06]: but apparently in this game you will set up your own little kingdom and there's little microtransactions and stuff I don't know, it sounds a little Farmville to me but with Ultima and you know, better graphics and all that stuff but I tried to play it, I wanted to review it for you guys but it crashed during the tutorial so I guess I'll have to try again this week.

1551
01:50:32,844 --> 01:50:33,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Is any of our listeners playing?

1552
01:50:34,365 --> 01:50:37,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Chatters, has anyone tried Lord of Ultima that came out this week?

1553
01:50:37,248 --> 01:50:37,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody?

1554
01:50:39,069 --> 01:50:45,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we can have a guild or a kingdom or something I don't know

1555
01:50:45,558 --> 01:50:45,818
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

1556
01:51:01,474 --> 01:51:02,895
[SPEAKER_03]: We're drowning in letters.

1557
01:51:04,076 --> 01:51:04,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Redertainment.

1558
01:51:16,985 --> 01:51:19,286
[SPEAKER_03]: about this was Walmart's effort to create their own bank.

1559
01:51:19,966 --> 01:51:24,527
[SPEAKER_03]: They wanted to lower the prices of check and credit card processing by cutting out the middleman in this process.

1560
01:51:24,988 --> 01:51:30,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Walmart wanted to establish this bank in the mediocre state of Utah, which is how I came to learn about it.

1561
01:51:30,349 --> 01:51:35,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Ultimately, the banking lobbies in Utah put the kibosh on this deal and the effort ultimately died.

1562
01:51:36,411 --> 01:51:45,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Activision establishing their own bank assembly lowered credit card processing fees for people playing WoW and also acts as an additional revenue stream for Activision as if they need another...

1563
01:51:46,814 --> 01:51:48,636
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying this would be good for the consumer.

1564
01:51:48,716 --> 01:51:57,183
[SPEAKER_03]: The bank of Activision would inevitably charge bank customers out the ass for bank fees, jack up interest rates on loans, and quickly foreclose on the homes of people who were delinquent on payments.

1565
01:51:57,943 --> 01:52:06,610
[SPEAKER_03]: These deplorable practices would happen because Activision seems only interested in squeezing all the cash they can out of consumers and not serving their customers well like most major banks do today.

1566
01:52:07,010 --> 01:52:07,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Ouch.

1567
01:52:08,191 --> 01:52:09,012
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to say anything.

1568
01:52:09,052 --> 01:52:10,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I work in the mortgage industry.

1569
01:52:11,283 --> 01:52:14,105
[SPEAKER_03]: So is there a legal reason why Activision has not established their own bank?

1570
01:52:14,645 --> 01:52:20,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is this whole rant evidence of my low opinion of the banking industry in America and of Activision?

1571
01:52:20,269 --> 01:52:21,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay care of entertainment.

1572
01:52:22,030 --> 01:52:28,554
[SPEAKER_03]: This message is brought to you by the Burns Cafe in Taylorsville, Utah, where thanks to their choice in the meat they serve, you can literally bite an ass.

1573
01:52:29,335 --> 01:52:36,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's a bummer you couldn't fit that in 140 characters or less, or the tweet might have made more sense at the time, but okay, I get your joke now, lol.

1574
01:52:39,503 --> 01:52:40,004
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1575
01:52:40,024 --> 01:52:41,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Activision's not going to set up a bank.

1576
01:52:41,787 --> 01:52:42,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they care.

1577
01:52:42,908 --> 01:52:45,292
[SPEAKER_06]: I get the point you're trying to make, but come on.

1578
01:52:48,757 --> 01:52:49,719
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cute though.

1579
01:52:49,739 --> 01:52:50,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Your email was cute.

1580
01:52:50,780 --> 01:52:51,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Your thought is cute.

1581
01:52:51,541 --> 01:52:51,942
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.

1582
01:52:53,052 --> 01:52:54,692
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1583
01:53:20,319 --> 01:53:21,580
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a suggestion for Konami.

1584
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:30,228
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're going to do poppin' music Wii V2, they should take the normal poppin' controller and have a slot in it for the Wiimote like how Activision did for Guitar Hero 3 for Wii.

1585
01:53:30,768 --> 01:53:32,490
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking... Oh god, please.

1586
01:53:33,170 --> 01:53:33,871
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just awful.

1587
01:53:34,231 --> 01:53:36,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking for some fun RPGs for the 360 Help.

1588
01:53:37,674 --> 01:53:42,601
[SPEAKER_03]: That's literally how it said, I am looking for fun RPGs for the 360.

1589
01:53:43,081 --> 01:53:43,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Help.

1590
01:53:43,562 --> 01:53:43,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Period.

1591
01:53:43,762 --> 01:53:44,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Was this typed on an iPhone?

1592
01:53:45,825 --> 01:53:47,387
[SPEAKER_03]: I can type better than this on an iPhone, Rob.

1593
01:53:47,848 --> 01:53:50,892
[SPEAKER_03]: And besides that, iPhones, auto-capitalize and fix your spelling.

1594
01:53:52,506 --> 01:54:18,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoever accepted my PA challenge should know that I only have SM and DDR US3 and I am looking for an online challenge on Live Sincerely DS Master 26 PS I want to find a copy of Disney Mix for PS1 and Goldeneye Clone for today's consoles I have Disney Mix, I have both of them I have the Japanese one and the US one and you can't have it

1595
01:54:19,285 --> 01:54:20,306
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1596
01:54:49,565 --> 01:54:50,206
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

1597
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:13,943
[SPEAKER_03]: DS Master just not allowed to email us unless it's been spellchecked and grammarchecked.

1598
01:55:29,147 --> 01:55:32,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, Bobby's in chat and says, you know he does this on purpose, right?

1599
01:55:32,190 --> 01:55:33,932
[SPEAKER_06]: The only way to stop it is to not even bother.

1600
01:55:34,093 --> 01:55:34,673
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I did.

1601
01:55:34,693 --> 01:55:35,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't give him the attention.

1602
01:55:36,115 --> 01:55:38,738
[SPEAKER_03]: That's actually what I was just about to say because I wasn't looking at you anymore.

1603
01:55:39,258 --> 01:55:41,461
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to stop reading emails from him unless they're typed properly.

1604
01:55:42,110 --> 01:55:42,490
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fair.

1605
01:55:43,231 --> 01:55:47,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you need to have somebody proofread it and then we might read them.

1606
01:55:47,693 --> 01:55:47,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Might.

1607
01:55:48,954 --> 01:55:50,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, wait, but there was a couple other points I wanted to get.

1608
01:55:51,035 --> 01:55:51,896
[SPEAKER_06]: RPGs on the 360.

1609
01:55:51,956 --> 01:55:55,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy XIII is good.

1610
01:55:56,258 --> 01:55:59,040
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess a lot of people liked Infinite Discovery even though I did not.

1611
01:55:59,220 --> 01:55:59,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue Dragon.

1612
01:56:00,381 --> 01:56:00,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue Dragon.

1613
01:56:00,981 --> 01:56:01,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, whatever.

1614
01:56:01,501 --> 01:56:01,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Lost Odyssey.

1615
01:56:01,942 --> 01:56:02,582
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked Blue Dragon.

1616
01:56:02,602 --> 01:56:03,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Lost Odyssey, yes, thank you.

1617
01:56:04,703 --> 01:56:05,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Blue Dragon's okay.

1618
01:56:05,504 --> 01:56:06,424
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Blue Dragon.

1619
01:56:06,444 --> 01:56:07,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Play the other ones first.

1620
01:56:08,385 --> 01:56:09,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Bite my butt.

1621
01:56:09,566 --> 01:56:11,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Blue Dragon, actually, I will give Blue Dragon this.

1622
01:56:11,629 --> 01:56:15,515
[SPEAKER_06]: If you liked the Super Nintendo RPGs, it's very retro-esque.

1623
01:56:16,357 --> 01:56:18,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Blue Dragon should have just been on the Super Nintendo.

1624
01:56:18,820 --> 01:56:21,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue Dragon reminds me of playing a Dreamcast RPG.

1625
01:56:21,624 --> 01:56:22,085
[SPEAKER_03]: End of story.

1626
01:56:22,185 --> 01:56:22,606
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give you that.

1627
01:56:22,886 --> 01:56:23,688
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like playing Evolution.

1628
01:56:24,666 --> 01:56:26,128
[SPEAKER_06]: The other one, oh, I remember the other one.

1629
01:56:26,828 --> 01:56:28,169
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, what the hell are you smoking?

1630
01:56:28,269 --> 01:56:29,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Beat and Groovy.

1631
01:56:29,650 --> 01:56:30,591
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just not a good game.

1632
01:56:31,071 --> 01:56:32,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Beat and Groovy was unfinished.

1633
01:56:32,573 --> 01:56:38,858
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an unfinished pile of poop that Konami put on the arcade that, honestly, Microsoft should have rejected.

1634
01:56:39,258 --> 01:56:41,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, it's a horrible abortion of a game.

1635
01:56:42,881 --> 01:56:46,504
[SPEAKER_06]: It's literally, I'm not saying that, it is literally an abortion.

1636
01:56:47,084 --> 01:56:48,345
[SPEAKER_06]: It was stopped...

1637
01:56:49,546 --> 01:57:08,477
[SPEAKER_06]: halfway through it was actually finished and put on the marketplace you have like up to 9 star difficulties on songs that are never used there's no song on there that's harder than like a 5 star difficulty the song list is laughable there was no like download content or anything released it is a bad unfinished aborted game

1638
01:57:11,246 --> 01:57:12,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Do not buy it.

1639
01:57:12,407 --> 01:57:13,408
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not even kidding.

1640
01:57:13,508 --> 01:57:14,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't support that crap.

1641
01:57:35,683 --> 01:57:36,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1642
01:57:58,315 --> 01:58:04,720
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, why would you bring something that's, you know, incredibly niche over here?

1643
01:58:04,740 --> 01:58:06,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Just fucking fail at it.

1644
01:58:06,241 --> 01:58:10,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I mean, I understand wanting to bring the niche thing over here if you do a good job with it.

1645
01:58:10,785 --> 01:58:13,847
[SPEAKER_06]: But that, I mean, was set up for failure from the beginning.

1646
01:58:13,867 --> 01:58:16,009
[SPEAKER_06]: They can't even nail... Honestly, I'm throwing this out here.

1647
01:58:16,229 --> 01:58:19,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoever is responsible for that game should have been fired.

1648
01:58:20,493 --> 01:58:21,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I'm not even kidding.

1649
01:58:21,453 --> 01:58:22,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoever was responsible for that...

1650
01:58:23,815 --> 01:58:24,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Fire Em.

1651
01:58:25,776 --> 01:58:28,538
[SPEAKER_06]: That was unexcusable, that game.

1652
01:58:29,838 --> 01:58:30,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Period.

1653
01:58:31,599 --> 01:58:31,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1654
01:58:33,120 --> 01:58:35,242
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you giggling at over there, DarkSakura?

1655
01:58:35,942 --> 01:58:37,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you even paying attention to the show?

1656
01:58:38,543 --> 01:58:39,744
[SPEAKER_03]: I am paying attention to the show.

1657
01:58:39,924 --> 01:58:44,087
[SPEAKER_03]: I just was distracted by something and I found a link to a product called HanderPants.

1658
01:58:45,607 --> 01:58:46,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Underpants for your hands.

1659
01:58:47,328 --> 01:58:48,209
[SPEAKER_06]: HanderPants?

1660
01:58:49,450 --> 01:58:51,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Why on earth would you need HanderPants?

1661
01:58:52,316 --> 01:58:53,017
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1662
01:58:53,297 --> 01:58:54,017
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think it's funny.

1663
01:58:54,037 --> 01:58:55,598
[SPEAKER_06]: They're called gloves.

1664
01:58:55,618 --> 01:58:59,280
[SPEAKER_03]: They're fingerless gloves with the design of underwear.

1665
01:58:59,300 --> 01:59:00,281
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to link it into the chatroom.

1666
01:59:00,321 --> 01:59:00,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Pants.

1667
01:59:00,721 --> 01:59:01,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus.

1668
01:59:03,743 --> 01:59:05,224
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in the same vein as mantis.

1669
01:59:06,044 --> 01:59:09,326
[SPEAKER_07]: You go up to somebody and you're like, look at my manti pants.

1670
01:59:09,386 --> 01:59:10,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at my hot throat pants.

1671
01:59:11,308 --> 01:59:12,168
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.

1672
01:59:12,869 --> 01:59:13,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, I don't.

1673
01:59:15,290 --> 01:59:16,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at my mantis.

1674
01:59:18,726 --> 01:59:20,707
[SPEAKER_06]: I am so easily distracted today Oh, it's not funny

1675
01:59:46,854 --> 01:59:51,019
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100Matt says this topic sounds automatically better than DSMaster's email.

1676
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:51,780
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what's funny?

1677
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:53,342
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't even finish with his email.

1678
01:59:53,382 --> 01:59:57,868
[SPEAKER_06]: We just went right on to talking about mantis and I'm enjoying myself more than I was five minutes ago.

1679
02:00:02,974 --> 02:00:03,354
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1680
02:00:03,434 --> 02:00:05,235
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that should be the rule from now on.

1681
02:00:07,076 --> 02:00:07,817
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I have it.

1682
02:00:08,237 --> 02:00:09,758
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a new OLR rule.

1683
02:00:09,938 --> 02:00:15,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you please get out the stone tablets and get out the chisel because we're going to write a new rule.

1684
02:00:16,382 --> 02:00:24,287
[SPEAKER_06]: When you send us a question to the mailbag and it is so horribly tight and grammar and spelling.

1685
02:00:24,307 --> 02:00:28,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, if you make a couple mistakes here and there, I'm not the best with spelling and grammar either.

1686
02:00:28,430 --> 02:00:30,591
[SPEAKER_06]: But at least if you put out an effort, we're not going to laugh at you.

1687
02:00:31,129 --> 02:00:58,842
[SPEAKER_06]: at least you're consistent if you just have a horrible email that you didn't even bother to try with and you typed it like it was a text message on the cell phone we are going to answer your question with mantis.net is the website you need to go to fix your problem mantis.net or possibly handerpants when you send us a question that stinks mantis.net is where you need to go to find your answer exactly

1688
02:01:00,092 --> 02:01:02,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Try the high cut ones.

1689
02:01:03,115 --> 02:01:04,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Put that on the wiki.

1690
02:01:04,056 --> 02:01:04,976
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an official rule.

1691
02:01:05,657 --> 02:01:07,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, whoever updates their wiki, add it.

1692
02:01:09,981 --> 02:01:15,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to the I like game suggestion RPG 360.

1693
02:01:16,988 --> 02:01:17,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, email her.

1694
02:01:17,849 --> 02:01:20,212
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you'll find the answer at mantis.net.

1695
02:01:20,772 --> 02:01:21,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1696
02:01:24,801 --> 02:01:26,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of which... These things have flies.

1697
02:01:26,762 --> 02:01:30,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get to... Rob, they do have embroidered briefs.

1698
02:01:30,783 --> 02:01:34,624
[SPEAKER_06]: You're telling me this like I would want to suddenly go... I don't want you to get any.

1699
02:01:34,664 --> 02:01:35,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying that they're funny.

1700
02:01:37,785 --> 02:01:38,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get to the episode.

1701
02:01:54,519 --> 02:01:54,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Lowkey.

1702
02:02:05,201 --> 02:02:08,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, F you to bad drivers, two types in particular.

1703
02:02:08,865 --> 02:02:23,157
[SPEAKER_07]: One, the person that decides, hey, you know, it's going to be a great idea to stop four car lengths before the car that's in front of them, making it near impossible to go around them, or the fact that they go really slow to accelerate once the light does change.

1704
02:02:24,318 --> 02:02:29,202
[SPEAKER_07]: And then two, the more dangerous type, the people that run stop signs and run stop lights.

1705
02:02:30,043 --> 02:02:37,069
[SPEAKER_07]: They're there for safety, and the fact that you just blow right through them like you don't give a shit, that's how people die.

1706
02:02:37,349 --> 02:02:38,650
[SPEAKER_07]: So, stop it.

1707
02:02:39,171 --> 02:02:40,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I don't want to die.

1708
02:02:43,255 --> 02:02:47,278
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, I'm laughing too hard because I'm looking at this website.

1709
02:02:48,158 --> 02:02:50,299
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really have a lot of FUs of the week.

1710
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:52,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I had a pretty good week.

1711
02:02:53,581 --> 02:02:55,302
[SPEAKER_06]: I really don't think I had a lot of bad things happen.

1712
02:02:55,342 --> 02:02:58,544
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess FU to those work days that start at 6 a.m.

1713
02:02:58,564 --> 02:03:01,046
[SPEAKER_06]: because getting up at 5 o'clock to go to work kind of stinks.

1714
02:03:01,086 --> 02:03:04,308
[SPEAKER_06]: But at least the days go by fast, so even that's not really a complaint.

1715
02:03:05,839 --> 02:03:13,943
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's get to some more gaming news, and then we'll open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, and who knows what phone calls we might get tonight.

1716
02:03:14,823 --> 02:03:15,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1717
02:03:15,884 --> 02:03:22,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so, you know, this whole drama with Infinity Ward and Activision is just nuts.

1718
02:03:23,747 --> 02:03:31,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Activision, they've hired a person to, I guess, run their community forum or whatever, Dan Amrich.

1719
02:03:32,970 --> 02:03:35,411
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess they have a Facebook, because everybody does.

1720
02:03:36,291 --> 02:03:44,514
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's basically trying to give their side, I guess, of the whole bonus situation for Infinity Ward.

1721
02:03:45,835 --> 02:03:49,816
[SPEAKER_07]: He says, Vince and Jason had very large bonuses.

1722
02:03:49,876 --> 02:03:52,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Those bonuses are being redistributed to everyone else.

1723
02:03:53,257 --> 02:03:56,920
[SPEAKER_07]: to people who did not allegedly attempt to steal company secrets.

1724
02:03:58,462 --> 02:04:00,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Activision is not pocketing the bonus money.

1725
02:04:01,164 --> 02:04:04,588
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still going to the people who work at Infinity Ward.

1726
02:04:05,468 --> 02:04:08,051
[SPEAKER_07]: But you have to work at Infinity Ward to get it.

1727
02:04:09,532 --> 02:04:14,717
[SPEAKER_07]: C. I don't want to see talented people screwed out of a paycheck any more than you do.

1728
02:04:17,606 --> 02:04:20,029
[SPEAKER_06]: So are they trying to be all like, hey, we're the good guys.

1729
02:04:20,049 --> 02:04:20,890
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to pay out those bonuses.

1730
02:04:20,910 --> 02:04:21,871
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we're going to pay them.

1731
02:04:21,931 --> 02:04:22,672
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to pay them.

1732
02:04:22,712 --> 02:04:23,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't worry.

1733
02:04:23,093 --> 02:04:24,495
[SPEAKER_07]: They're getting a bigger share of the bonus.

1734
02:04:24,855 --> 02:04:27,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, why don't you pay their bonuses in the first place?

1735
02:04:27,118 --> 02:04:29,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that was the whole problem is you weren't paying the bonuses.

1736
02:04:31,075 --> 02:04:35,779
[SPEAKER_07]: What, the game's been out for almost six months now?

1737
02:04:36,799 --> 02:04:38,100
[SPEAKER_06]: What's it like to get a bonus?

1738
02:04:38,461 --> 02:04:41,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't it time to get the bonuses out there?

1739
02:04:41,763 --> 02:04:44,345
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought bonuses were just that, a bonus.

1740
02:04:44,946 --> 02:04:45,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Allegedly.

1741
02:04:45,786 --> 02:04:49,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Why didn't you even put that allegedly attempted to steal a company's secrets?

1742
02:04:50,870 --> 02:04:51,911
[SPEAKER_07]: They're the ones that made the game.

1743
02:04:52,371 --> 02:04:53,973
[SPEAKER_07]: I think all their secrets are in their head.

1744
02:04:54,493 --> 02:04:55,594
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't need to steal anything.

1745
02:04:58,271 --> 02:04:59,033
[SPEAKER_07]: He's just a douche.

1746
02:05:00,375 --> 02:05:03,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, he's sub-douche to the major douche.

1747
02:05:05,413 --> 02:05:06,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Why even bother having a community?

1748
02:05:06,994 --> 02:05:11,697
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is the same guy I want to say that they had, like, why do you hate Activision or whatever?

1749
02:05:11,877 --> 02:05:14,139
[SPEAKER_07]: We want your honest answers or something like that.

1750
02:05:14,359 --> 02:05:15,019
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, really?

1751
02:05:15,260 --> 02:05:16,861
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't know why we don't like you?

1752
02:05:16,901 --> 02:05:17,561
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, really?

1753
02:05:18,282 --> 02:05:19,142
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to ask?

1754
02:05:20,003 --> 02:05:21,244
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like my wife, you know?

1755
02:05:21,324 --> 02:05:24,566
[SPEAKER_07]: If, like, she's mad at me and I'm like, well, what are you mad at me for?

1756
02:05:24,626 --> 02:05:25,567
[SPEAKER_07]: And she's like, really?

1757
02:05:26,027 --> 02:05:26,867
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't know?

1758
02:05:27,388 --> 02:05:28,969
[SPEAKER_03]: That just makes me even more pissed off.

1759
02:05:28,989 --> 02:05:32,811
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because we expect our spouses to be psychic when we're psychotic.

1760
02:05:34,372 --> 02:05:36,214
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm letting the secret out of the bag.

1761
02:05:36,234 --> 02:05:39,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, you're going to get nasty emails from the women of America?

1762
02:05:40,316 --> 02:05:40,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a chick!

1763
02:05:41,957 --> 02:05:43,478
[SPEAKER_06]: The women of America don't listen to our show.

1764
02:05:44,899 --> 02:05:47,761
[SPEAKER_03]: I can get away with saying this because it's exactly what I pull on my husband.

1765
02:05:48,541 --> 02:05:50,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, Dan, you didn't hear that!

1766
02:05:55,228 --> 02:06:18,548
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, although it's unclear whether the remaining Infinity Ward employees have received their personal bonuses for Modern Warfare 2 yet, Activision lawsuit claims that Zampanelli and West allocated to themselves approximately one-third of the total bonus pool for the Call of Duty franchise bonuses, which included the first Modern Warfare game.

1767
02:06:19,088 --> 02:06:38,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Further, it contends that Wes and Zampella were demanding an even larger share of the bonus pool for Modern Warfare 2 Oh, so now we're saying that they're getting too much of a bonus or whatever, that they wanted too much of a bonus Well, that's too bad that they got fired, so that really doesn't make any sense

1768
02:06:42,036 --> 02:07:07,197
[SPEAKER_07]: uh and no word on when this whole thing is going to be taken care of but they're thinking that more people are going to leave so uh oh and they have a big old quote for Activision's counter suit which I don't really feel like reading because it's just a bunch of crap in my opinion ipso facto sue money

1769
02:07:09,239 --> 02:07:10,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on then, shall we?

1770
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:14,482
[SPEAKER_06]: One more story for you guys, and then I guess we'll open up the Skype line and see what happens.

1771
02:07:14,542 --> 02:07:16,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Could be a fun time tonight.

1772
02:07:16,903 --> 02:07:31,992
[SPEAKER_07]: 877-GAME-OLR I forgot to mention, real quick, this kind of goes along with the story, but it is apparently rumored, or I don't know if it's confirmed or rumored, but they're saying that three Modern Warfare 2 games are going to be out by 2011.

1773
02:07:33,653 --> 02:07:41,524
[SPEAKER_07]: or three, not Modern Warfare three Call of Duty games will be out good luck guys good luck

1774
02:07:42,116 --> 02:07:43,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, these other games might be out soon.

1775
02:07:43,937 --> 02:07:45,359
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more website leaks.

1776
02:07:45,439 --> 02:07:51,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember earlier in the show we had news about Farmville and some apparent websites that were being registered that gave away Farmville on other platforms.

1777
02:07:51,864 --> 02:07:56,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, something similar is kind of happening, but it has to do with some different games, like games that people actually play.

1778
02:07:57,448 --> 02:07:58,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the interesting thing.

1779
02:07:58,569 --> 02:08:06,735
[SPEAKER_06]: The URLs were registered for BloodstoneGame.com, was registered Wednesday, and of course Bloodstone is supposed to be the next Bond game.

1780
02:08:06,755 --> 02:08:08,096
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like the rumors that's coming out.

1781
02:08:08,416 --> 02:08:09,878
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know what also was registered?

1782
02:08:09,898 --> 02:08:10,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Bloodstone.

1783
02:08:10,418 --> 02:08:11,820
[SPEAKER_06]: and GoldeneyeGame.com.

1784
02:08:11,860 --> 02:08:21,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Could this be, I don't know, something where, you know, there was rumors before there might be a Wii version of Goldeneye coming out or something.

1785
02:08:21,610 --> 02:08:22,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

1786
02:08:23,352 --> 02:08:27,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is strange because I could have sworn they said before, it's not fucking happening.

1787
02:08:27,256 --> 02:08:27,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.

1788
02:08:28,752 --> 02:08:30,472
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, where there's a will, there's a way.

1789
02:08:31,033 --> 02:08:38,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, apparently, a game that was discovered, DriverSanFranciscoGame.com was registered by Ubisoft.

1790
02:08:40,755 --> 02:08:41,776
[SPEAKER_06]: It's by Ubisoft?

1791
02:08:41,896 --> 02:08:42,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't know.

1792
02:08:42,776 --> 02:08:45,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, but didn't Atari sell it off?

1793
02:08:45,857 --> 02:08:47,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's right.

1794
02:08:47,177 --> 02:08:47,817
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

1795
02:08:47,837 --> 02:08:48,658
[SPEAKER_06]: That's too bad.

1796
02:08:48,798 --> 02:08:54,199
[SPEAKER_06]: AssassinsCreedBrotherhood.com and LaserHomeBattleground.com What the hell is that?

1797
02:08:54,259 --> 02:08:55,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Laser Home Battleground?

1798
02:08:55,720 --> 02:08:56,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like laser tag.

1799
02:08:58,365 --> 02:09:00,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's LaserCatsBattleground.com?

1800
02:09:00,646 --> 02:09:01,186
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the game.

1801
02:09:01,226 --> 02:09:03,687
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have given that top of the news reporting.

1802
02:09:03,947 --> 02:09:04,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's easy.

1803
02:09:04,647 --> 02:09:08,688
[SPEAKER_06]: You just put a cat stuffed animal on top of the laser gun.

1804
02:09:09,848 --> 02:09:10,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1805
02:09:11,089 --> 02:09:15,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Supposedly, Assassin's Creed is going to have another sequel in 2011 anyway, so maybe that's the subtitle of the game.

1806
02:09:15,930 --> 02:09:17,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.

1807
02:09:17,511 --> 02:09:17,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

1808
02:09:18,691 --> 02:09:19,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Brotherhood?

1809
02:09:20,132 --> 02:09:20,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1810
02:09:22,032 --> 02:09:28,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Assassin'sCreedBrotherhood.com Sounds like another PSP game.

1811
02:09:28,792 --> 02:09:29,573
[SPEAKER_06]: That could be too.

1812
02:09:29,693 --> 02:09:29,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

1813
02:09:30,013 --> 02:09:31,875
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to the website right now and it times out.

1814
02:09:32,015 --> 02:09:33,456
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess you have to look up the registry info.

1815
02:09:33,937 --> 02:09:36,199
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no forwarding happening just yet.

1816
02:09:37,801 --> 02:09:38,461
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, guys.

1817
02:09:38,501 --> 02:09:42,505
[SPEAKER_06]: This is part of the show where we're going to open up the Skype line and take your calls.

1818
02:09:42,525 --> 02:09:45,908
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1819
02:09:45,928 --> 02:09:47,730
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're going to call us on Skype, that's great.

1820
02:09:47,770 --> 02:09:51,614
[SPEAKER_06]: The quality is really good on Skype, but we do encourage you to call Echo123 on Skype.

1821
02:09:53,315 --> 02:09:59,640
[SPEAKER_06]: or I think in the newer versions of Skype you click a button that says test call or something and you can test your configuration first.

1822
02:09:59,700 --> 02:10:03,943
[SPEAKER_06]: I really urge you to do that or I'm going to make fun of you when your call stinks.

1823
02:10:04,363 --> 02:10:07,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Orange Sausage Radio is the place to call on Skype.

1824
02:10:07,986 --> 02:10:13,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever you want to talk about tonight's show, go ahead, say your piece, have a voice.

1825
02:10:14,010 --> 02:10:20,995
[SPEAKER_06]: While we wait for calls because it takes about a minute for me to say something and the listeners actually hear it with the encoding and everything, Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us?

1826
02:10:21,741 --> 02:10:27,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, apparently there is a new game coming out from Bayer, I guess.

1827
02:10:28,465 --> 02:10:39,031
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Knock Em Down's World's Fair, and apparently it's a device that, or it comes with a device that you use to check your blood glucose level, and you can play the game that way.

1828
02:10:39,511 --> 02:10:44,372
[SPEAKER_06]: That's funny, that's one of the other Tiger Claw stories from the Twitter, but he sent so many I had to pick and choose.

1829
02:10:44,892 --> 02:10:45,752
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny you brought it up too.

1830
02:10:46,473 --> 02:10:49,113
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought I remembered hearing that this game was in development before.

1831
02:10:49,193 --> 02:10:54,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I wanted to say some time ago, I heard that there was a DS game in development that was using medical stuff.

1832
02:10:54,735 --> 02:10:57,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I can't imagine though this would be too popular.

1833
02:10:57,795 --> 02:11:00,736
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it seems like a very narrow market that they'd be, you know...

1834
02:11:01,300 --> 02:11:03,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yes, you're right.

1835
02:11:03,362 --> 02:11:11,649
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I mean, for that market, I think it could actually be really cool because, you know, there's a lot of tweens and teenagers that get diagnosed with diabetes at a very young age.

1836
02:11:12,169 --> 02:11:18,135
[SPEAKER_06]: And this could be an interesting way to teach them kind of the management of that because, you know, you have to alter your diet, take your blood glucose, know what it means.

1837
02:11:18,435 --> 02:11:19,596
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's a lot that goes with it.

1838
02:11:19,636 --> 02:11:21,437
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just like, hey, you have diabetes.

1839
02:11:22,298 --> 02:11:23,639
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's a lot of things that go with it.

1840
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:28,323
[SPEAKER_06]: So I actually think even though, yeah, you're right, it's a niche thing, it's kind of neat.

1841
02:11:28,904 --> 02:11:29,024
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.

1842
02:11:30,359 --> 02:11:33,080
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure it will sell the particular products.

1843
02:11:35,100 --> 02:11:36,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Monitors and stuff are what?

1844
02:11:36,720 --> 02:11:38,661
[SPEAKER_06]: $200 a pop and then you have to buy test strips?

1845
02:11:39,861 --> 02:11:44,562
[SPEAKER_06]: I know your insurance usually covers that stuff, but you still have some choices on what brands you get.

1846
02:11:44,942 --> 02:11:46,362
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still pretty crazy.

1847
02:11:46,402 --> 02:11:48,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a number of friends who have to monitor.

1848
02:11:49,462 --> 02:11:51,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially if you're the type 1.

1849
02:11:53,323 --> 02:11:54,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's different stages of it.

1850
02:11:55,304 --> 02:11:57,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes you can be diabetic, but you don't actually have to test anything.

1851
02:11:58,562 --> 02:12:01,963
[SPEAKER_06]: You still have to watch it, or I guess you could slip into one of the other types.

1852
02:12:02,264 --> 02:12:06,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, typically adult onset, I believe that's type 2.

1853
02:12:07,506 --> 02:12:11,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, my grandma had it, so it was unfortunate.

1854
02:12:12,468 --> 02:12:18,190
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why, you know what, I upgraded the version of Skype, so I'm almost worried that the calls aren't coming through, so I'm just going to make sure.

1855
02:12:18,210 --> 02:12:19,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Bobby's call came through.

1856
02:12:19,210 --> 02:12:22,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's true, Bobby's call came through, so that should work.

1857
02:12:22,491 --> 02:12:24,852
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just calling the 877 number to make sure everything's okay.

1858
02:12:25,493 --> 02:12:26,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Where are you people?

1859
02:12:26,966 --> 02:12:27,706
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, it's kind of weird.

1860
02:12:27,727 --> 02:12:28,867
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not getting any calls tonight.

1861
02:12:29,007 --> 02:12:30,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually it's flooded with people.

1862
02:12:30,988 --> 02:12:34,290
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess they're worried about the threats of sending people to mantis.net.

1863
02:12:34,330 --> 02:12:34,671
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1864
02:12:36,192 --> 02:12:37,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I got some more Last Minute Stories.

1865
02:12:37,552 --> 02:12:38,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's hear it.

1866
02:12:39,240 --> 02:13:03,368
[SPEAKER_07]: MacWarrior 4 there was that whole kind of delay they were going to release the game free to play over the web and it was being held up by Microsoft now it's finally been cleared so there will be coming or coming soon there will be a brand new port of MacWarrior 4 that you'll be able to play for free over the internet through a web browser isn't that exciting

1867
02:13:06,286 --> 02:13:27,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Mad Catz is apparently now going to be making all the principal peripherals for Rock Band basically that means all the peripherals that come with say Rock Band 3 or any future releases going forth will be made by Mad Catz and not by EA or whoever the hell they had making their peripherals

1868
02:13:28,301 --> 02:13:34,306
[SPEAKER_07]: and yeah, I know Mad Catz, Purples at one time really sucked but to be honest, I kind of like their guitar at least.

1869
02:13:34,646 --> 02:13:37,248
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the bass and I dig that.

1870
02:13:37,268 --> 02:13:38,269
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty cool.

1871
02:13:38,289 --> 02:13:43,893
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't wear out like the fucking rock band, just regular guitar they have.

1872
02:13:43,953 --> 02:13:44,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess what?

1873
02:13:44,474 --> 02:13:45,154
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a call.

1874
02:13:45,434 --> 02:13:46,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

1875
02:13:46,495 --> 02:13:47,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Dance Radio.

1876
02:13:47,576 --> 02:13:47,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1877
02:13:49,257 --> 02:13:50,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, this is Amiga 777.

1878
02:13:50,779 --> 02:13:50,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Amiga 777.

1879
02:13:51,099 --> 02:13:52,240
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the Amiga.

1880
02:13:52,260 --> 02:13:52,740
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?

1881
02:13:56,340 --> 02:14:00,323
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just testing the streams to make sure that the calls are going through for you.

1882
02:14:00,704 --> 02:14:02,485
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty much it.

1883
02:14:03,546 --> 02:14:05,427
[SPEAKER_06]: A-okay works great.

1884
02:14:06,048 --> 02:14:06,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.

1885
02:14:07,009 --> 02:14:07,529
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1886
02:14:07,589 --> 02:14:08,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, wait, wait.

1887
02:14:12,013 --> 02:14:12,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, yes.

1888
02:14:13,434 --> 02:14:15,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Just confirm me it's not your stream.

1889
02:14:15,115 --> 02:14:16,136
[SPEAKER_07]: We just don't want to talk to you.

1890
02:14:16,156 --> 02:14:17,937
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just a courtesy call.

1891
02:14:18,878 --> 02:14:19,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Just checking.

1892
02:14:20,299 --> 02:14:20,740
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1893
02:14:20,760 --> 02:14:21,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything's fine, guys.

1894
02:14:22,521 --> 02:14:23,121
[SPEAKER_06]: No worries.

1895
02:14:23,282 --> 02:14:23,682
[SPEAKER_06]: You're good.

1896
02:14:27,561 --> 02:14:28,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's funny.

1897
02:14:29,984 --> 02:14:30,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, right, whatever.

1898
02:14:32,046 --> 02:14:33,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's someone that we haven't heard from.

1899
02:14:33,187 --> 02:14:35,349
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one of my favorite phone calls I've ever got, just so you know.

1900
02:14:35,649 --> 02:14:35,969
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1901
02:14:36,290 --> 02:14:38,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's someone we haven't heard from in a while.

1902
02:14:38,452 --> 02:14:40,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, two years to be exact.

1903
02:14:40,854 --> 02:14:46,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Surfer Girl is back with a new rumor regarding the slim Xbox 360.

1904
02:14:46,639 --> 02:14:48,581
[SPEAKER_07]: She says it's going to be unveiled at E3.

1905
02:14:48,941 --> 02:14:51,003
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to rebrand the Xbox 360 as well.

1906
02:14:53,385 --> 02:15:04,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, apparently the, uh, review will happen during, or the Slim 360 Natal bundle will happen at one of the two, yes, two press conferences at this year's E3.

1907
02:15:05,409 --> 02:15:12,671
[SPEAKER_07]: What's more is the 360 will be getting a subtle rebrand with a new logo and black as the new primary color for the console.

1908
02:15:13,011 --> 02:15:18,833
[SPEAKER_07]: They feel that the new system needs to be black because, um, a white Natal wouldn't sit well against the typical, um,

1909
02:15:19,373 --> 02:15:20,534
[SPEAKER_07]: and Gloss Black TV.

1910
02:15:20,974 --> 02:15:22,696
[SPEAKER_07]: The new system design is pretty neat.

1911
02:15:23,136 --> 02:15:29,041
[SPEAKER_07]: And Natal, let's just say you're going to be very surprised and very pleased by one of the games being revealed.

1912
02:15:29,401 --> 02:15:29,821
[SPEAKER_07]: What is it?

1913
02:15:30,662 --> 02:15:35,906
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course, in bold, it says, might get shot or MGS.

1914
02:15:36,166 --> 02:15:38,888
[SPEAKER_07]: So perhaps a new Metal Gear Solid game.

1915
02:15:39,448 --> 02:15:41,190
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's go to the phones.

1916
02:15:41,350 --> 02:15:42,751
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have another test call coming in.

1917
02:15:42,791 --> 02:15:43,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1918
02:15:43,772 --> 02:15:44,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1919
02:15:45,233 --> 02:15:45,493
Hey.

1920
02:15:50,407 --> 02:15:51,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello?

1921
02:15:52,909 --> 02:15:54,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, DT, what's on your mind?

1922
02:15:55,371 --> 02:15:55,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're here.

1923
02:15:55,932 --> 02:16:00,876
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to turn down the speakers on the computer because then you get all confused.

1924
02:16:00,896 --> 02:16:01,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

1925
02:16:01,997 --> 02:16:02,498
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's up?

1926
02:16:02,518 --> 02:16:03,278
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1927
02:16:05,400 --> 02:16:10,325
[SPEAKER_01]: Just plugging the, I know it's a month late, but plugging the WonderCon article.

1928
02:16:11,058 --> 02:16:12,339
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, WonderCon.

1929
02:16:12,359 --> 02:16:16,461
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to go to WonderCon a couple weeks ago, and you wrote a whole nice little article about it that's on the website.

1930
02:16:17,742 --> 02:16:18,383
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.

1931
02:16:18,443 --> 02:16:20,664
[SPEAKER_06]: How did you enjoy things at WonderCon?

1932
02:16:20,724 --> 02:16:21,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you have a good time overall?

1933
02:16:23,326 --> 02:16:24,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God, yeah.

1934
02:16:25,027 --> 02:16:27,428
[SPEAKER_01]: First stop was at a Capcom booth.

1935
02:16:27,448 --> 02:16:33,392
[SPEAKER_01]: They were showing Final Fight and Super Street Fighter 4 and Plus Planet 2, actually.

1936
02:16:34,032 --> 02:16:39,315
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I actually read the article, believe it or not, and I heard you scored a soundtrack at the booth.

1937
02:16:39,355 --> 02:16:40,036
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you get there?

1938
02:16:41,974 --> 02:16:43,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, that was just posted online.

1939
02:16:43,455 --> 02:16:45,995
[SPEAKER_01]: What I got was a couple... Oh, no, wait, no, yeah, no, you're right.

1940
02:16:46,035 --> 02:16:48,956
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought the Mega... the Rockman 9 soundtrack.

1941
02:16:50,457 --> 02:16:50,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1942
02:16:50,977 --> 02:16:53,418
[SPEAKER_06]: I like how you call it Rockman 9 and not Mega Man 9.

1943
02:16:54,138 --> 02:16:55,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it actually the Japanese version?

1944
02:16:56,659 --> 02:16:57,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was.

1945
02:16:57,379 --> 02:16:57,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's cool.

1946
02:16:58,640 --> 02:16:59,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

1947
02:16:59,818 --> 02:17:00,258
[SPEAKER_06]: No hints.

1948
02:17:00,718 --> 02:17:03,900
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting, though, that you were at... Now, see, this kind of blows me away.

1949
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:08,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, even though, you know, I know it was a few weeks ago you went to WonderCon at this point, so for some people they're like, okay, old news.

1950
02:17:09,323 --> 02:17:26,011
[SPEAKER_06]: This does strike me as interesting, is that Capcom had to know that Marvel vs. Capcom 3 was happening when they did WonderCon, but yet they didn't say anything at what you would otherwise think is like a really freaking logical place to announce a game like Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

1951
02:17:27,011 --> 02:17:28,332
[SPEAKER_06]: And yet, not a peep, right?

1952
02:17:28,352 --> 02:17:28,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1953
02:17:30,993 --> 02:17:35,415
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they talked about being at future Comic Cons and whatnot with that.

1954
02:17:36,796 --> 02:17:38,436
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess WonderCon just wasn't good enough.

1955
02:17:38,496 --> 02:17:39,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Sad cry.

1956
02:17:39,797 --> 02:17:40,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Upset.

1957
02:17:40,077 --> 02:17:40,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1958
02:17:40,878 --> 02:17:41,278
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

1959
02:17:42,358 --> 02:17:46,620
[SPEAKER_06]: But hey, there's BayCon coming up, I think is a big sci-fi nerdy con.

1960
02:17:46,640 --> 02:17:50,362
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if there will be a lot of video games with that, but I know I had some friends talking about that Memorial Day weekend.

1961
02:17:50,382 --> 02:17:51,282
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, Fanime.

1962
02:17:52,103 --> 02:17:55,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Memorial Day weekend is always a big con weekend, so there's a lot of that coming up.

1963
02:17:56,165 --> 02:17:58,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Any cons in your future otherwise, DarkTetsuya?

1964
02:17:58,666 --> 02:17:58,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1965
02:18:00,578 --> 02:18:01,078
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1966
02:18:01,518 --> 02:18:03,760
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably just trying to go to Wendicon next year.

1967
02:18:03,800 --> 02:18:06,442
[SPEAKER_01]: I know my brother was excited about that.

1968
02:18:06,462 --> 02:18:08,524
[SPEAKER_01]: He's really digging the comics.

1969
02:18:09,264 --> 02:18:09,785
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.

1970
02:18:09,825 --> 02:18:10,905
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got to go to Comic-Con.

1971
02:18:10,925 --> 02:18:13,788
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard the one that happens in San Diego is epic.

1972
02:18:13,928 --> 02:18:17,070
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love to go someday, but I just don't know if I'm going to get this year.

1973
02:18:17,090 --> 02:18:17,871
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard it's already sold out.

1974
02:18:18,491 --> 02:18:18,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it?

1975
02:18:18,991 --> 02:18:19,852
[SPEAKER_06]: It wouldn't surprise me at all.

1976
02:18:20,172 --> 02:18:21,393
[SPEAKER_06]: With all the stars and everything to go.

1977
02:18:21,874 --> 02:18:23,535
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to plan for 2011 or something.

1978
02:18:24,335 --> 02:18:24,576
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1979
02:18:24,776 --> 02:18:27,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Dr. Tsui, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?

1980
02:18:29,625 --> 02:18:31,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, oh wait, yeah, no, I know.

1981
02:18:34,007 --> 02:18:38,309
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard some footage got stolen at the Super Street Fighter 4 launch event.

1982
02:18:38,529 --> 02:18:39,770
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you talked about that.

1983
02:18:40,750 --> 02:18:41,270
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't.

1984
02:18:41,310 --> 02:18:42,131
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you hear about this?

1985
02:18:42,171 --> 02:18:44,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I vaguely remember seeing an article on this.

1986
02:18:44,332 --> 02:18:44,992
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?

1987
02:18:45,032 --> 02:18:45,512
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on?

1988
02:18:47,113 --> 02:18:47,413
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1989
02:18:47,453 --> 02:18:55,437
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess someone stole a bunch of stuff at the Super Street Fighter launch event, like footage of the different players and all of that, and a MacBook.

1990
02:18:59,863 --> 02:19:03,085
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get what the advantage would be to stealing something like that.

1991
02:19:03,285 --> 02:19:05,406
[SPEAKER_06]: The game is pretty much out now.

1992
02:19:05,646 --> 02:19:07,607
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't steal anything regarding the game.

1993
02:19:07,627 --> 02:19:12,230
[SPEAKER_07]: They stole camera equipment and SD memory cards and a MacBook.

1994
02:19:12,370 --> 02:19:14,392
[SPEAKER_06]: It was that they wanted the computer equipment.

1995
02:19:14,432 --> 02:19:16,313
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't anything to do with what was on it.

1996
02:19:16,433 --> 02:19:17,994
[SPEAKER_07]: It was IM8 bit.

1997
02:19:18,434 --> 02:19:20,015
[SPEAKER_07]: That's stinky.

1998
02:19:20,996 --> 02:19:23,077
[SPEAKER_06]: How did a thief get into an event like that?

1999
02:19:23,507 --> 02:19:24,948
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2000
02:19:49,448 --> 02:19:50,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no problem.

2001
02:20:07,129 --> 02:20:27,772
[SPEAKER_06]: the fine dark tit CEO who really tries to actually put content on orangeontrader.com nice guy TigerClaw says they don't care about the equipment all they care about is getting the footage TigerClaw says they recorded footage of the event yeah they just want the footage back it's just messed up thieves suck alright what else you got Loki anything else

2002
02:20:29,013 --> 02:20:56,723
[SPEAKER_07]: just some last minute stuff here there's another little big or I guess a little big planet PSP download content pack that's going to be coming out called the Turbo Pack and it's going to feature some new stock car racing inspired tracks and vehicles and also they're going to have I guess some construction based vehicles as well they're going to be available such as forklifts, cranes, and cement mixers so that's kind of neat

2003
02:20:58,143 --> 02:21:06,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Unbound Saga, which was a comic-based beat-em-up game that was on the PSP, is now making its way to Xbox Live Arcade.

2004
02:21:06,528 --> 02:21:08,610
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of a little bit like Comic Zone, I guess.

2005
02:21:10,231 --> 02:21:12,972
[SPEAKER_07]: PSP one is alright, I guess.

2006
02:21:13,112 --> 02:21:15,374
[SPEAKER_07]: But that will be coming out a little bit later on this year.

2007
02:21:17,055 --> 02:21:25,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Um... Asia is getting a limited edition Final Fantasy XIII controller with the silk screen of lightning on it.

2008
02:21:25,301 --> 02:21:30,065
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess to go with your, you know, Final Fantasy XIII lightning PS3.

2009
02:21:30,345 --> 02:21:34,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Why that wasn't included with the PS3 is beyond me, but... A little late.

2010
02:21:34,368 --> 02:21:34,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, whatever.

2011
02:21:35,169 --> 02:21:37,171
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess, you know, opportunity to sell it twice.

2012
02:21:38,031 --> 02:21:39,112
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, um...

2013
02:21:40,433 --> 02:21:46,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Lastly, just a little bit of elaboration on a story we had earlier talking about delays from Nintendo.

2014
02:21:46,460 --> 02:21:48,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of as I thought, different things.

2015
02:21:49,423 --> 02:21:55,510
[SPEAKER_07]: It's taken a little bit longer to get the development for Metroid Other M done because they're working with a third-party company on it.

2016
02:21:56,451 --> 02:21:58,534
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why it's been delayed to August 31st.

2017
02:21:59,855 --> 02:22:11,692
[SPEAKER_07]: and then of course Sin and Punishment Star Successor is just basically a fill of space because it was originally going to come out at the beginning of the month and they did their excuses well we just want you to have some more time to play Super Mario Galaxy 2 so

2018
02:22:14,301 --> 02:22:14,901
[SPEAKER_07]: That is it.

2019
02:22:15,662 --> 02:22:16,062
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2020
02:22:17,043 --> 02:22:19,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't know what's up.

2021
02:22:19,124 --> 02:22:20,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Something's in the water.

2022
02:22:20,625 --> 02:22:21,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, people.

2023
02:22:21,746 --> 02:22:23,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Ronchan, call us.

2024
02:22:23,167 --> 02:22:24,207
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I closed Skype.

2025
02:22:25,008 --> 02:22:25,568
[SPEAKER_07]: One last thing.

2026
02:22:25,608 --> 02:22:26,248
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot.

2027
02:22:26,689 --> 02:22:28,130
[SPEAKER_07]: This might be the next Yaris.

2028
02:22:28,510 --> 02:22:34,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, Audi is releasing a free rhythm-based driving game for the iPhone.

2029
02:22:35,554 --> 02:22:36,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, goody.

2030
02:22:37,315 --> 02:22:38,156
[SPEAKER_07]: No more to say there.

2031
02:22:39,752 --> 02:22:56,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, I don't know, I guess, you know, it's okay, some weeks, you know, in all things considered, it was a bit of a slow news week of sorts, you know, a lot of the stories we had tonight weren't like huge things, I mean, a lot of stories were confirmations of things that were spoiled last week, and you know, so I guess It really does, but where's the love?

2032
02:22:56,649 --> 02:22:58,030
[SPEAKER_03]: That's alright Where's the love?

2033
02:22:58,070 --> 02:22:58,611
[SPEAKER_06]: That's alright

2034
02:22:59,011 --> 02:23:03,192
[SPEAKER_06]: I could use the extra time tonight to take care of some things before work tomorrow, so I'm sure we all could.

2035
02:23:03,973 --> 02:23:05,853
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're going to wrap it up, believe it or not.

2036
02:23:05,873 --> 02:23:08,314
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit of a shorter show tonight, but that's okay.

2037
02:23:08,354 --> 02:23:11,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, it just wasn't a huge, huge week for news.

2038
02:23:12,696 --> 02:23:13,876
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like a bunch of Capcom news.

2039
02:23:13,916 --> 02:23:14,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, eh, we already knew that.

2040
02:23:14,956 --> 02:23:15,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we already heard.

2041
02:23:16,057 --> 02:23:16,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Been there, done that.

2042
02:23:17,217 --> 02:23:33,407
[SPEAKER_06]: of course you know it's going to be like this for a few weeks because E3 is on the horizon so outside of your E3 leaks May is going to be a bit of a slow month so if I'd known we would have planned a game or something for tonight so you know what that means next week if it's a slow news week again we're going to have a game or something

2043
02:23:33,727 --> 02:23:36,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, or we might have an actual guest on the show.

2044
02:23:37,270 --> 02:23:39,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I know my friend Matt is dying to come back.

2045
02:23:39,352 --> 02:23:43,356
[SPEAKER_06]: He was here back when the show was still at my house, and he's like, I really want to come back and hang with you guys.

2046
02:23:43,376 --> 02:23:43,816
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, okay.

2047
02:23:44,236 --> 02:23:47,099
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'm sure Alan will be here in the next couple weeks.

2048
02:23:47,179 --> 02:23:51,162
[SPEAKER_06]: He's loving coming to the show, so we'll have him at some point.

2049
02:23:52,303 --> 02:23:54,385
[SPEAKER_06]: BlackWolfInChat says, okay, so let me get this straight.

2050
02:23:54,786 --> 02:23:58,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Rama calls my show for the first time ever, but doesn't call OLR.

2051
02:24:00,600 --> 02:24:01,321
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a weird night.

2052
02:24:01,401 --> 02:24:01,882
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay.

2053
02:24:02,202 --> 02:24:03,003
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I closed Skype.

2054
02:24:03,123 --> 02:24:04,324
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, guys.

2055
02:24:04,364 --> 02:24:05,165
[SPEAKER_06]: The moment's passed.

2056
02:24:07,127 --> 02:24:08,469
[SPEAKER_06]: The opportunity has passed.

2057
02:24:08,529 --> 02:24:08,989
[SPEAKER_06]: That's okay.

2058
02:24:09,430 --> 02:24:10,371
[SPEAKER_06]: I won't take it personally.

2059
02:24:12,713 --> 02:24:14,596
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just going to have a big diva stop.

2060
02:24:15,717 --> 02:24:15,957
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2061
02:24:16,518 --> 02:24:17,479
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but send us some emails.

2062
02:24:17,539 --> 02:24:20,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and all that fun stuff.

2063
02:24:21,463 --> 02:24:26,926
[SPEAKER_06]: And see, I would love to just do a game, pull a game out of the hat, but we don't have anything.

2064
02:24:27,207 --> 02:24:27,887
[SPEAKER_06]: That's okay, guys.

2065
02:24:27,927 --> 02:24:28,467
[SPEAKER_06]: No, seriously.

2066
02:24:28,567 --> 02:24:32,290
[SPEAKER_06]: I could stand to wrap up the show by 9 o'clock and then go home and take care of some other stuff.

2067
02:24:32,810 --> 02:24:35,492
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we are out, you guys.

2068
02:24:35,992 --> 02:24:36,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go around.

2069
02:24:36,512 --> 02:24:37,113
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what you could do?

2070
02:24:37,353 --> 02:24:37,533
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

2071
02:24:37,673 --> 02:24:39,234
[SPEAKER_03]: You should play the clip of Julian again.

2072
02:24:39,972 --> 02:24:42,133
[SPEAKER_06]: I will play the clip of Julian again because you know what?

2073
02:24:42,193 --> 02:24:47,737
[SPEAKER_06]: No phone call that we're even going to get could possibly match how disgustingly cute Julian is in that clip.

2074
02:24:48,117 --> 02:24:49,038
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's hear it.

2075
02:24:49,118 --> 02:24:49,798
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a cute kid.

2076
02:24:50,038 --> 02:24:50,959
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a very cute kid.

2077
02:24:51,039 --> 02:24:56,042
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm telling you, this is going to be all the rage at youtube.com slash users slash DarkSakuraOLR.

2078
02:24:59,825 --> 02:25:00,805
[SPEAKER_00]: Dalek.

2079
02:25:01,466 --> 02:25:02,606
[SPEAKER_04]: What does a Dalek say?

2080
02:25:04,528 --> 02:25:05,068
[SPEAKER_00]: Dalek.

2081
02:25:07,711 --> 02:25:12,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Exterminate Exterminate Exterminate Exterminate Exterminate Exterminate Exterminate

2082
02:25:32,762 --> 02:25:33,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you?

2083
02:25:33,142 --> 02:25:34,043
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I didn't really.

2084
02:25:34,183 --> 02:25:34,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Not me.

2085
02:25:35,744 --> 02:25:39,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind, I was watching PBS a lot when I was a kid.

2086
02:25:40,627 --> 02:25:42,508
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Doctor Who came on PBS.

2087
02:25:43,509 --> 02:25:44,610
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I started with like...

2088
02:25:46,463 --> 02:25:48,583
[SPEAKER_03]: 4th Doctor Sarah Jane era.

2089
02:25:49,624 --> 02:25:52,724
[SPEAKER_03]: So she's always going to be my favorite because she's who I remember.

2090
02:25:53,384 --> 02:25:57,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Mace Atsuma in chat says, Julian is smarter than DS Master.

2091
02:25:57,625 --> 02:25:58,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Confirms.

2092
02:25:59,666 --> 02:26:02,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Julian is smarter than most adults I know.

2093
02:26:02,966 --> 02:26:03,586
[SPEAKER_06]: That's mean.

2094
02:26:03,646 --> 02:26:04,147
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

2095
02:26:04,287 --> 02:26:04,907
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm serious.

2096
02:26:05,107 --> 02:26:06,267
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a smart kid.

2097
02:26:07,227 --> 02:26:08,527
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's a bit of a smartass too.

2098
02:26:09,208 --> 02:26:09,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like his parents.

2099
02:26:10,128 --> 02:26:10,788
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit sassy?

2100
02:26:11,528 --> 02:26:12,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Square One TV Home Room

2101
02:26:35,816 --> 02:26:36,917
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't play it at school.

2102
02:26:37,197 --> 02:26:40,601
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we had Channel One or something.

2103
02:26:41,702 --> 02:26:48,348
[SPEAKER_03]: They would pipe this pay cable show into our homerooms every morning and try to edumacate us.

2104
02:26:49,930 --> 02:26:50,790
[SPEAKER_03]: I just did my homework.

2105
02:26:50,971 --> 02:26:57,957
[SPEAKER_06]: The only show I remember watching on an early morning TV thing at school was Kids Court with Paul Provanza.

2106
02:26:59,018 --> 02:26:59,899
[SPEAKER_06]: I found happy tape.

2107
02:27:19,682 --> 02:27:27,492
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is I see some yarn over on DarkSakura's bookshelf and it makes me think, I wish I was a cat so I could just play with that yarn all day.

2108
02:27:27,973 --> 02:27:30,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is the scarf of yours I still need to finish.

2109
02:27:30,456 --> 02:27:34,101
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to see the scarf I got yesterday at a thrift store for a dollar.

2110
02:27:34,481 --> 02:27:35,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, awesome.

2111
02:27:35,983 --> 02:27:36,384
[SPEAKER_03]: You were...

2112
02:27:37,341 --> 02:27:39,502
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like a flaming gay fourth doctor.

2113
02:27:39,562 --> 02:27:40,162
[SPEAKER_06]: I really was.

2114
02:27:41,022 --> 02:27:41,942
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very short.

2115
02:27:42,182 --> 02:27:42,722
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2116
02:27:42,742 --> 02:27:45,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, because it was for a 12-year-old girl and I bought it at thrift store to wear to Rocky.

2117
02:27:46,463 --> 02:27:48,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, but that's neither here nor there.

2118
02:27:48,924 --> 02:27:51,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

2119
02:27:51,565 --> 02:27:52,925
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to play more Just Cause 2.

2120
02:27:53,285 --> 02:28:00,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully this time the textures actually show up so that I can see what I'm doing because it's kind of hard when the whole map is see-through or most of the map is see-through.

2121
02:28:02,267 --> 02:28:08,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys so much for downloading our show, listening to it live, supporting independent podcasting.

2122
02:28:08,551 --> 02:28:09,571
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are awesome.

2123
02:28:09,591 --> 02:28:17,856
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I say that week after week, but if you think about it, next week is episode 365 of our show.

2124
02:28:17,916 --> 02:28:20,558
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one for every day of the year.

2125
02:28:21,358 --> 02:28:29,843
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a whole long time, and we just wouldn't have made it this long if it wasn't for the support of you guys just being here every week and saying, you guys are funny.

2126
02:28:31,885 --> 02:28:32,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys so much.

2127
02:28:32,825 --> 02:28:40,330
[SPEAKER_06]: All we ask, if you enjoyed Orange Lounge Radio, just tell a friend or two or five about Orange Lounge Radio and what we do here.

2128
02:28:40,350 --> 02:28:41,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Just help us spread the word.

2129
02:28:41,210 --> 02:28:42,251
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really all we ask.

2130
02:28:42,331 --> 02:28:45,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Many of you have shared your tweets and Facebook messages about how you've done that.

2131
02:28:45,733 --> 02:28:51,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Trust me, we really do appreciate it because we don't have money to take out advertising or whatever.

2132
02:28:51,937 --> 02:28:53,037
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never asked to be on a show.

2133
02:28:53,057 --> 02:28:53,837
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not surprised.

2134
02:29:16,943 --> 02:29:19,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, you were on, like, All Games Interactive a couple times, I think.

2135
02:29:20,605 --> 02:29:21,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't you do a couple calls with them?

2136
02:29:21,745 --> 02:29:22,666
[SPEAKER_06]: I did a toss-over.

2137
02:29:22,746 --> 02:29:23,446
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

2138
02:29:23,486 --> 02:29:24,887
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2139
02:29:25,087 --> 02:29:33,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, actually, and I do also want to say, given that graduation thing, by the way, it's Mar and Marvel, our own tiara.

2140
02:29:35,332 --> 02:29:36,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations in two months.

2141
02:29:36,873 --> 02:29:37,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

2142
02:29:37,373 --> 02:29:37,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Graduating.

2143
02:29:37,853 --> 02:29:38,413
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the major?

2144
02:29:39,154 --> 02:29:39,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Graphic design.

2145
02:29:40,134 --> 02:29:40,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Fun.

2146
02:29:41,035 --> 02:29:41,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Good stuff.

2147
02:29:41,815 --> 02:29:42,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully she'll be back on the show.

2148
02:29:43,036 --> 02:29:45,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully she'll be taking a graduation gift trip out here.

2149
02:29:46,138 --> 02:29:48,720
[SPEAKER_06]: But Loki, poor Loki, who has not been on any show.

2150
02:29:49,020 --> 02:29:50,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody needs to email Loki and get him on a show.

2151
02:29:50,961 --> 02:29:51,481
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all right.

2152
02:29:51,682 --> 02:29:51,922
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2153
02:29:53,303 --> 02:29:53,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Doesn't matter.

2154
02:29:54,583 --> 02:29:54,864
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2155
02:29:56,204 --> 02:29:56,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

2156
02:29:57,065 --> 02:30:00,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Amiga777 in chat says, I nominate Tommy T to be a guest.

2157
02:30:00,267 --> 02:30:01,928
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming he means Tommy Tallarico.

2158
02:30:02,248 --> 02:30:04,470
[SPEAKER_06]: We had him on a couple of years ago.

2159
02:30:05,911 --> 02:30:07,812
[SPEAKER_06]: It was right before the video game's live CD came out.

2160
02:30:08,052 --> 02:30:08,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

2161
02:30:20,748 --> 02:30:21,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, that's it.

2162
02:30:21,408 --> 02:30:21,729
[SPEAKER_06]: We're done.

2163
02:30:21,749 --> 02:30:22,289
[SPEAKER_06]: We're wrapping up.

2164
02:30:22,309 --> 02:30:22,889
[SPEAKER_06]: We're out of here.

2165
02:30:22,949 --> 02:30:25,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys so much again for your support.

2166
02:30:25,591 --> 02:30:27,192
[SPEAKER_06]: And what do you say we do it all again next week?

2167
02:30:27,252 --> 02:30:27,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Sound good?

2168
02:30:28,172 --> 02:30:30,594
[SPEAKER_06]: And no, it is not episode live 365.

2169
02:30:30,634 --> 02:30:33,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I got nothing going on next week, sure.

2170
02:30:33,455 --> 02:30:34,276
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't speak about that.

2171
02:30:34,296 --> 02:30:35,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they even around still?

2172
02:30:35,857 --> 02:30:36,477
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe so.

2173
02:30:38,138 --> 02:30:40,820
[SPEAKER_06]: But they don't look any different than they did about four years ago when we left.

2174
02:30:41,240 --> 02:30:41,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, that's it.

2175
02:30:41,740 --> 02:30:42,060
[SPEAKER_06]: We're done.

2176
02:30:42,121 --> 02:30:42,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

2177
02:30:42,361 --> 02:30:42,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Good night.

2178
02:30:43,550 --> 02:30:46,331
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2179
02:30:46,851 --> 02:30:50,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

2180
02:30:50,533 --> 02:30:59,197
[SPEAKER_02]: To join us for a live show, visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific Time.

2181
02:30:59,697 --> 02:31:11,302
[SPEAKER_02]: The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff of Orange Lounge Radio or allgames.com, but were probably right anyway.

2182
02:31:11,902 --> 02:31:12,723
[SPEAKER_02]: See you next week!

2183
02:31:14,539 --> 02:31:15,743
Thanks for watching!
