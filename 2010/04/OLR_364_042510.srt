Here's your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and the Low Crew

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight at the 25th of 2010, could a new TV station come to an Xbox near you?

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Some big Wii titles get delayed, and a Capcom press event confirms all that was spoiled last week

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Hello my friends all across the internet and welcome to another episode, episode 364 of Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's the video game program where every gamer has a voice

00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Pull up a chair and join us and chat, chat.orangeloungeradio.com as we tape live on this lovely Sunday evening

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
April the 25th of 2010, right after Bobby Blackwolf has finished his show at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Say hello as well to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Grapes

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
How are you doing?

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Grapes

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Full of grapes?

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Muscat grapes

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Did they taste grape?

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh, we got three hours full of puns for you guys, I bet you can't wait

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I heard worse over the weekend

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Alright, and Loki, Techmaster Loki's in the house

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yes I am

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
How are you doing?

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm doing okay

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Now, Techmaster Loki, brought to the show with him tonight from KFC, Double Down number 2

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yes, this time without the horrible cheese sauce

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And it still had kind of that little taste of the cheese sauce on there but

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It was alright, it was definitely edible this time

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And I just have to say it's kind of just average, really for the cost you're better off getting pretty much anything else

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Even stuff from KFC, because I mean Double Down's like a good, I think $6.99 or something

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I mean, hell, you can get a lot more chicken for that

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Just get a chicken wing

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Or just get wings

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Just get a chicken wing

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Just keep it old school

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Barbeque wings or something like that, that's really where it's at, it's good stuff

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Don't need the rest of the Double Down, it's just really just an excuse to sell expensive chicken

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That's all it really is

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But yeah, tried it with extra bacon even

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And just, it's kind of okay

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Even extra bacon didn't make it better?

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Didn't really make it that, didn't make a difference really

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Because it was just too much of the white meat chicken flavor

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Alright, going to our chat room at chat.orangelandre.com

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You know we call them the always present fourth guest on the show

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Because we don't have any special guests tonight

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
We haven't had a lot of special guests at Studio Dark Soccer, I don't know what it is

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The people I invented to were outside in the front yard racing RC cars

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Or they were

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Is that what they're really doing?

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That's funny

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And chasing

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I only saw the girls across the street in the Barbie car

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That I almost ran over

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That was while, when you were just here and sitting here wondering what to do

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yes

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
They were outside actually chasing the dog with the RC cars

58
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Will's dog won too

59
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I see

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And just to bring some light to what Dark Soccer said while you were sitting here wondering what to do

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Usually I get to the show about an hour early, right?

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I get here to the show because you know I want to set everything up

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Get the mixing board, the mics, the chairs, the computer

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Make sure we're ready for Bobby's call because he actually calls us about 5.45, 5.50

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You know make sure everything's good to go

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So that we're ready for showtime

67
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But tonight I arrived and Dark Soccer had been proactive tonight

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
She had already set up the mixing board, plugged it in, had the mics

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Everything was ready to go, I just had to turn on the computer

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Except for Loki's mic because you forgot

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Well that was my fault but that's neither here nor there

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And I had gifts

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yes and she even gave me, what is this, like sweet beer or something, soda beer

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Shandy, it's a Shandy Bass

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Dark Soccer's trying to get me drunk

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's beer soda

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I don't know why she's trying to get me drunk

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's a little too sweet overall but it's really good because it tastes just like

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's basically like a lemon soda with a little bit of beer in it

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Alright, I know we usually start off the show talking about our gaming weeks

81
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But there's some actually really funny personal things I think we have to talk about

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And Dark Soccer, this cracked me up

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Something that you have recently added to YouTube

84
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Give us some background on what's going on here and what happened this past week

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Well, I went to my friend Becky's son's third birthday party

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Well okay, first of all, first of all that morning I went to a bar mitzvah

87
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I hadn't eaten anything so I won't even go into that

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So I went to Becky's son's birthday party

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And he was really cute and he was wearing like the best shirt ever

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Which was a t-shirt with a Dalek on it

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So I actually managed to get some commentary from him

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And I love this YouTube more than anything

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What?

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The first thing it got cut off is I asked him what was on his shirt

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Oh okay, so, hey kid, what is on your shirt?

96
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Dalek

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What does a Dalek say?

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's a serendipity

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And my immediate reaction was, Dark Soccer, what are you teaching the children?

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I didn't teach him that

101
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It wasn't me, I didn't do it

102
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It was either his mother or his aunt or some relative along that vein

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And if you want the chat room shouting link, link

104
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But I want to give this out so that everybody has it

105
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's just on Dark Soccer's personal YouTube which you've given up

106
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Dark Soccer O-L-R

107
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yeah, just YouTube, what, YouTube.com slash user slash Dark Soccer O-L-R

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
One word

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So there you go, exterminate

110
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Play it again, play it again, play it again

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
One more time, one more time

112
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Exterminate

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's not as scary when he says it

114
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's really not

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I also like how you said Dalek

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Alright

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Dalek

118
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I hope you had fun, that's going to be the next David goes to the dentist video right there

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Exterminate

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Alright we have breaking

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Becky, because I'm chatting with Becky, she said that he watched Doctor Who with them and seen a Dalek episode

122
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I see

123
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So he knows what a Dalek is

124
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Alright, well we got some other breaking news, live unfolding, breaking news here at the O-L-R studio headquarters

125
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
We go live over to Tech Master Loki with the special report here

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What is going on, this is unfolding live actually, literally

127
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
One minute before we went live tonight, we've found something out, what is going on, Loki?

128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Apparently one of Jamie's friends messaged me on Facebook

129
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
By the name TJ McKimy

130
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And posted a link to a Stockton Craigslist entry

131
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Guess whose number happens up here, right there

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Oh, the guy that stole my 360 a while back

133
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Off loady, PS3 now

134
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And your money

135
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yes, and my money

136
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So the guy who hack soared your 360 for real and just ran off with it and never

137
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And if you didn't hear the show about a month ago, long story short, you went out to meet the guy

138
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And he was going to do the J-Tag thing on your 360 so you could play as Baluta and all that stuff and no more heroes and stuff, right?

139
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So he was going to do that to your 360 and he said, you know, come back in a couple hours

140
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Which should have been your hint right there, Loki, but you know, you don't know until it happens

141
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And so Loki tried to go back and yeah, the guy ran off with his 360

142
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And that's why a super nice listener in Austin, we suspect, based on where the package came from

143
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Apparently sent Loki a new one

144
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So you think we'd be over this by now, but thanks to Super Sleuth TJ on Facebook

145
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Apparently this guy is at it again on Craigslist

146
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Oh yeah

147
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I think I want to nail him

148
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I know, and the chatters are going, call him, call him live on air

149
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I am not radio professionally

150
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I think there's an issue with doing that when you don't have the person's permission

151
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I realize he's the bad guy, but I worry it would turn into one of those things where the thief falls through the roof

152
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And then sues the owners of the home for the fact that he broke his foot trying to break into the house

153
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You know what I mean?

154
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So I can't do anything about it

155
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But

156
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
As we look to the person who can do something about it

157
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Or, well, I'm just saying

158
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I don't want to drive down the Stockton again, I mean, it's Stockton, it's just, it's awful

159
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You have, you have, we, hey, we don't write the news, we just report it

160
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I say just call Stockton PD and

161
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It would be funny, but, I mean, what are they going to do?

162
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
They're going to be like, well, it's our word versus yours

163
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Uh, yeah, I was trying to illegally hack my 360

164
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Well, not even, it doesn't even matter if that was the case

165
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I was having solder work done on my, you know, 360s motherboard

166
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Alright, and Bobby in chat, you know, because he knows more about radio than I do

167
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So that's a, it depends on the states guy

168
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Some states only need one side's permission

169
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You know, again, it's just one of those things where it's like, you know what, it's

170
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What about calling Disneyland?

171
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I don't think it would be good

172
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Remember when they called Disneyland?

173
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That was harmless, that was funny

174
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
This will be funny too

175
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And then the call got disconnected right in the middle

176
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Dark Saga is referring to an old ass episode

177
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
A ten year old episode of Understation Live

178
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That was great

179
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Where we called the pay phone at Disneyland

180
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That's how you know it's old

181
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Because, are there even pay phones at Disneyland anymore?

182
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I know, right

183
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
We called the pay phone at Disneyland and started having a conversation with some guy

184
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And like right in the middle of it, the call just dropped

185
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And we're like, oh shit, the Disneyland mafia

186
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Just like tapped into the conversation and just terminated the call right there

187
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Exterminate!

188
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Alright

189
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And then, oh apparently now, on top of everything else

190
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Chatters are saying the stream is down

191
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
See?

192
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Something is going

193
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
No, we're back

194
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I know it's back, I'm looking at the little broadcasty thingy

195
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And it says it's still sending data over

196
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Well we still gotta tape the show

197
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Because remember, I know live listeners

198
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
We love you guys, but we love the podcasters too

199
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And the podcast people, they don't get the stream downtime

200
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So we just gotta keep on rolling

201
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I don't know what happened there, that's very odd

202
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Xbox guys hacking our network too

203
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Alright, let's get around ten minutes into the show finally

204
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And we can finally talk about our gaming week

205
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Stark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

206
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It was not

207
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Oh yeah, I started playing Babylonian Twins

208
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Now that I finally have gotten my project out of the way

209
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And had a chance to play something

210
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's really fun, oh my god it's really fun

211
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But it's definitely, it's like a puzzle adventure game

212
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It really is, because like you do one thing with one brother

213
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And then the other one is a statue

214
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So you actually can use him, when one's a statue

215
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You can jump off of him and put him on buttons and levers and things

216
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So it's just, it's really, really fun

217
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
This is the best way I can say it, it's just really fun

218
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And I've gotten through like the first

219
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I got through the tutorial level just playing around

220
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And now I'm actually doing one of the levels for real

221
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You know, like I said, I've really been busy doing a lot of other projects

222
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
But this is, it's really fun, it's a fun little game

223
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And once I play more I'm actually going to do a little write up on it

224
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Oh my gosh, our website might actually get some content outside of the

225
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Lovely, and don't get me wrong, I love the I love that song

226
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
But that's about the only new content our website gets besides show updates

227
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So that would be great, I'd love that

228
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
What?

229
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
New content for the site, it'd be great

230
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Oh yeah

231
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I mean, you know, we have the I love that song, that's it

232
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You know, we get it, people love music

233
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
My brain was still on the game, so I was like, what?

234
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Oh, that, yeah

235
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
See, I'd already forgotten about it

236
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

237
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It was okay, just, you know, playing Grand Theft Auto at work

238
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And that was fun, and then

239
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Let's see, this weekend I played through some of Just Cause 2

240
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Just the beginning, because I have a version of the game

241
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That has some of the PC mods on it

242
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So that was kind of fun to play around with

243
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Although, I don't think I ripped it right because

244
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
A lot of the textures weren't appearing, so it was kind of hard to play

245
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But it was fun nonetheless, so I re-ripped it

246
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And hopefully it'll work this time

247
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And then of course, more Escaluda 2

248
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
This time I went through the Black Label Novice

249
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And that was fun

250
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'll probably play through the rest of the game later on

251
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Just kind of go in one version of the game at a time

252
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And...

253
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What else did I play?

254
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I don't think I played in Final Fantasy 13

255
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So yeah, I think that's about it, unfortunately

256
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I gotta be honest, my gaming week this week was not really that action-packed

257
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I really didn't play anything but WoW

258
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I had a very Jamie week this week, actually

259
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Nothing but Star Trek Online, except for playing Star Trek Online with WoW

260
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Oh, I did play Star Trek Online last night, sorry

261
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Oh my bad, well that's just a given

262
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Well no, I hadn't touched it for a while, but I did play it last night

263
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I will say this though, obviously I've been going through personal stuff with the job change

264
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It's not a boo-hoo for me, well actually it's a good thing

265
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But it just takes away from the gaming schedule

266
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I will say this, on the Warcraft front I actually did accomplish quite a bit

267
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I actually got one of my new characters, my warrior that I've been leveling with Alan

268
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
We got those together to Northrend, which is a big event

269
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
We're in the new content, the Wrath of the Lich King

270
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
But I will also say this, for the first time finally this week

271
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I know, I'm a little late, I'm not much of a raider usually

272
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I usually run the raids a lot, and WoW I used to about a year ago, but I don't really do it anymore

273
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
But this week, just randomly got asked to go, I went

274
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I ran Icecrown Citadel, the new, well newish, it's not that new anymore for a WoW player

275
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
But a couple months old raid, that's basically the end game right now

276
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The Lich King is the boss of Icecrown Citadel at the very very end

277
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I was there for a couple hours, we got to the gunship battle

278
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I had to go because I had other commitments

279
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
But we fought the first two bosses, it was cool

280
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
So I can finally say I've seen the inside of Icecrown Citadel, woo!

281
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I need to run it again though, because you get reputation just for killing monsters in there

282
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You can get cool rings, and stuff

283
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So, that was it, I had a pretty Warcraft wonderful week

284
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I will try to get back into some of the consoles this week

285
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I know there's some stuff for Game Room coming out, we'll get to later in the show

286
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
That I definitely want to get around to

287
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Although something that somehow missed the show role, so I'll bring it up now

288
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I heard there were layoffs at Chrome this week

289
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Apparently the Chrome studio in Australia had some big layoffs

290
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And didn't they make Game Room?

291
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
So, are we screwed?

292
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Probably not

293
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
They have the emulation already set, it's just putting a ROM with an emulator in place

294
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Probably not even that, just putting a ROM in place

295
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Well they do other games too though right?

296
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Yeah they do other stuff

297
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
So maybe this just impacts the other stuff

298
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Because I was reading it had nothing to do with Game Room

299
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Even though Game Room kind of met with a reception

300
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
But that it was more the fact that they didn't get the rights to some Wii game they were going to do

301
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Based on, I don't remember now

302
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Somebody in chat will correct me

303
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But there was some game they were supposed to do

304
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I think it was like a movie tie-in or a sequel or something on the Wii

305
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
That they didn't end up getting to do and that kind of hurt them

306
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Isn't it always a movie tie-in or sequel on the Wii?

307
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Yeah

308
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
So

309
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Alright

310
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Anyhow, that's it for my gaming week and for my extra little news story I was throwing in there

311
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
See I'm starting the news before we even started the news

312
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Housekeeping tonight, not a lot of show notes

313
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I believe we're still here every week for the foreseeable future

314
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Although I will say our anniversary show is creeping up on us

315
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And our anniversary show is going to be the 27th I think of June?

316
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I don't know, it'll be the 27th of June

317
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Will be our what, 8 year anniversary show?

318
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Jeez

319
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I know right?

320
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
So that's in about 8 weeks

321
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And Memorial Day is coming up

322
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I think we're still all here for Memorial Day

323
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I don't think, is anyone going out of town for Memorial Day?

324
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
No

325
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And we still have a show on Memorial Day

326
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Alright

327
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
No Fonomy this year again

328
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I might be going actually

329
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Are you going to go?

330
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I don't know, it depends

331
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'd like to go and just kind of drop in

332
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
But we keep forgetting to like, oh yeah we should like try to get a panel

333
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
But that's got to be set in stone by now so we missed out on that one

334
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Maybe go just to say hey, we'll see

335
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Alright um

336
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Not that many people come and see us at panels anyways

337
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I've had fun

338
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It's always fun

339
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I don't know

340
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
More people came out of Fonomy than some of the other places I've gone

341
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
To do panels

342
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Well sometimes when you have panels at 7 in the morning

343
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It's kind of difficult to get a crowd

344
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Hey that was fun

345
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
That one kid who showed up had a good time

346
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's like what the hell are we doing here, seriously

347
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Alright

348
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Why'd I wake up early for this?

349
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Did you see that I've done a little bit of cleaning in here, a little bit?

350
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
A little bit

351
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So I've started the

352
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Your bookshelf looks a lot nicer than it used to

353
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Massive task

354
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It really does

355
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I've been starting the massive task of organizing this room

356
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Alright

357
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm putting pictures on the thing

358
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Ray Ayanami in chat says there aren't any OLR fans at Fonomy anyway

359
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
There's a few, there's the one guy who every year we're there

360
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Asked Loki some mat question

361
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Like why are you such a Mac hater?

362
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
There's some kid every year

363
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Cause of you

364
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
That should be your response next year

365
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Alright

366
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Because of stupid design decisions

367
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Like for example iTunes doesn't work with Windows XP 64 bit

368
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
For no reason whatsoever other than we want to be douchebag

369
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Wait, Windows 7 64 bit? Yes it does

370
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
No, Windows XP 64 bit

371
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
No it does not

372
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
No it does not

373
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Trust me

374
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I have experience

375
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It will not let you install it

376
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Wait, there's an XP 64 bit?

377
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I didn't even know that

378
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I know there's Windows 7 64 bit

379
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
That's what I run now

380
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
But, alright

381
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It does not support it for no reason other than Mac is retarded

382
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Um, yeah you're not a designer so

383
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Alright, can we please get onto gaming news

384
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And not the PC Mac wars again

385
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Jesus

386
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I put up the pictures on my bookshelf since it's awesome

387
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Gaming news, Loki

388
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Um, there is a rumor

389
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Coming from Bloomberg

390
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
That apparently

391
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
An ex-News Corp president

392
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Peter Churman

393
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Was engaged in talks

394
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Or I guess is currently engaged in talks

395
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
With Microsoft to possibly launch

396
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
An Xbox Live television channel

397
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Now this isn't necessarily gonna be a channel

398
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
That we see on TV

399
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Focused around the Xbox

400
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It's actually gonna be something that's gonna appear

401
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
On Xbox Live

402
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Apparently

403
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
During an April 12th meeting

404
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
At Microsoft's

405
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Reverend Washington office

406
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Churman proposed a channel

407
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Native to the Xbox 360

408
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
That would feature reruns and original shows

409
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
For an additional

410
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
One to two dollars

411
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Per month on top of the standard

412
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Xbox Live subscription fee

413
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And

414
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
So it's basically

415
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Peter is talking to lots of people

416
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
About lots of ideas in the digital space

417
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And of course

418
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Microsoft is not commenting

419
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
On it but it kind of

420
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Fits with the rumor

421
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
That we had last week that apparently

422
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Conan was in talks

423
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
With

424
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Possibly Microsoft for doing his show

425
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
On Xbox Live

426
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It's kind of interesting

427
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Um

428
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Who's to say this is off the table?

429
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I don't think it is

430
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I don't think it is either

431
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I think this isn't so much a rumor about

432
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What would have been

433
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I think this is a rumor about what's going to come

434
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I think maybe the fact that Conan

435
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Didn't go to Xbox maybe

436
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Slowed it down

437
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
But not that much

438
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You know what I mean? Well it's very risky

439
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
What were the realistic chances of Conan going to Xbox Live anyway?

440
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It's very risky

441
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Being that it's not established yet

442
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You don't know what kind of benefits and stuff

443
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And if the whole thing flopped

444
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It would be a wasted opportunity

445
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So it's a more safe

446
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
More safe bet for him to go to

447
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
TBS

448
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
But if

449
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
If Netflix

450
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And all that works on Xbox

451
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Then why can't

452
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
This

453
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I think this would be a good idea

454
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Just depends on the amount of content

455
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
That's on here because a lot of people nowadays

456
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
With cable and satellite bills

457
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Are higher and higher

458
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
If this is only going to be

459
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
The equivalent of possibly $12 to $24

460
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
A year

461
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And the content's good

462
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
A lot of people would probably jump on that

463
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I know I would if it's got

464
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Some good shows on there

465
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And even just shows that are on normal

466
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Cable TV or something like that

467
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I'd be all for that

468
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Wouldn't that be ironic though

469
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
If you were getting your

470
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Television through cable

471
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And getting your TV through

472
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Because your Xbox is actually your cable provider

473
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Well thanks to the FCC

474
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And Comcast

475
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And stuff like that I'm sure that

476
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Since now

477
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
They're trying to

478
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Not pass the net neutrality

479
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Those laws and stuff

480
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
That they'll be able to

481
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Filter it out

482
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Oh Comcast, you want to get TV through our cable internet?

483
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
No, I'm sorry

484
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
That's not going to happen

485
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I think something's going to happen

486
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Where that's going to

487
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
The minute those little loopholes get exposed

488
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
That stuff's going to get revoked

489
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Playing quickly

490
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
But hopefully it's not just wishful thinking

491
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'll be really sad

492
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
But maybe it'll go a long way

493
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
In trying to get some competitors to Comcast

494
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Like people will come back to them?

495
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I don't think so

496
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
As far as the Xbox

497
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Channel goes though

498
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I remember last week we kind of had a discussion

499
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
With the PlayStation tester and all that stuff

500
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And you said something like you didn't really want to watch the tester

501
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Because you thought it was going to be a big commercial for Sony

502
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Well wouldn't an Xbox network

503
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Be a big commercial for Microsoft or

504
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It all depends on what content's on there

505
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Here's the thing

506
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The tester

507
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Where the prize is

508
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Becoming a Sony PlayStation tester

509
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Come on

510
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I mean of course it's going to be focusing

511
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
On a lot of the games that Sony has

512
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And people are like, oh my god I'm so excited to play the next

513
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Big Sony game coming out

514
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
That's retarded

515
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And yes if there was something like that on the Xbox

516
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
TV channel

517
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I wouldn't want to watch it either because it would just be a waste of my time

518
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It would still be a damn commercial for something

519
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Now if they had something that was

520
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Mainstream

521
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Like something that's on TV for example

522
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
That might be

523
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
That's different

524
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
If they had episodes of The Office or something like that

525
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Playing on there

526
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Just whatever

527
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You know what I mean?

528
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Well I don't have Netflix

529
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Oh okay I guess you got me there

530
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
But Netflix is so cheap

531
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Is it a dollar a month cheap?

532
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
No not that cheap

533
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Alright

534
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
But you'd have to pay for this TV thing too right?

535
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Isn't that what they were talking about?

536
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Yeah like an extra dollar or two a month

537
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
That's what they're looking to charge

538
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I guess that's not that bad

539
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Would I have to pay that Microsoft phony points?

540
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I don't think so, probably not

541
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It's interesting if it wouldn't be just

542
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Cause you know we talk about Xbox, Xbox, Xbox

543
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
But why wouldn't

544
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I mean if Microsoft's gonna launch a TV station

545
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Why wouldn't it be available on your computer?

546
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Why wouldn't it be available on your

547
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Windows mobile phone?

548
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Something to compete with the iPhone

549
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I would think that

550
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
An Xbox network is not really an

551
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Xbox network, it's a

552
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Microsoft network

553
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Well doesn't

554
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I mean they have MSNBC

555
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Maybe streaming stuff from that I don't know

556
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I think

557
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
The MSNBC agreement's a little funky

558
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I think it's a little more NBC than it is

559
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
MS at this point but I don't know

560
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I don't know the ins and outs of how all that works

561
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I guess I should stop trying to sound like an expert

562
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Move on to another story

563
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Let's talk about the PlayStation 3

564
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Since we've had a little bit of Xbox news

565
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
And talk about PlayStation 3

566
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
And there is some feathers

567
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Being ruffled on the PlayStation 3 this week

568
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And it has to do with the game

569
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Fight Double Impact or as I call it

570
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Magic Sword Double Impact

571
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
You see what's happened

572
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Is that this game will just

573
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Not run unless you are signed

574
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
In online on your PlayStation Network

575
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Account if you try to load the game

576
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And you're not signed in you're just gonna

577
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Get a message that says you need to sign into the PlayStation

578
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Network well

579
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
You know I know a lot of people myself

580
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Included it doesn't really matter because

581
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
With the PS3s having the wireless

582
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Internet built in and everything I'm pretty much

583
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Always connected to PlayStation Network

584
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
There's very little time I'm

585
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Not playing the PS3 and I'm not online

586
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But

587
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I mean what if my internet went down

588
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And I wanted to play

589
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
A video game which I do a lot

590
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
When my internet goes down to kind of pass the time

591
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
You know if I can't play wow I guess I'll go play

592
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Xbox or PSN

593
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
So

594
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I mean this thing is kind of weird

595
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
This is no better than the Ubisoft thing in my opinion

596
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
No it's not

597
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
You have to understand

598
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Why they're doing it in the first place

599
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
They're doing it because Sony

600
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Has this thing and this

601
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
It's kind of a loophole basically

602
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
They had a thing where if you download a title

603
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Say you buy whatever

604
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
You know a game flower or something like that

605
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
You can repurchase

606
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Or redownload flower onto

607
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Five different systems

608
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Say your system dies or whatever

609
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Instead of having to you know

610
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Change your

611
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Account so that

612
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
It's linked to a new system

613
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Instead of that you have

614
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Five different chances to download stuff

615
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Well here's what people are doing

616
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
They were basically having one person

617
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Buy it then downloading it for four

618
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Of their other friends on their other system

619
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
So basically one person buys the game and five people

620
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Play it

621
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
This is a feature that's in

622
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
The Playstation Network

623
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
This is something that launched with the PS3

624
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Capcom apparently

625
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Wanted to try something because they didn't like

626
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
The fact that they're losing out on

627
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
80% of their sales potentially

628
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
So what they're doing now

629
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Is they're limiting that to one person

630
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Now so you have to be the person

631
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
That bought it in order to play the game

632
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
So not only are they making you be

633
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Online they are also

634
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Limiting the fact that you can't share this

635
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Or redownload it again

636
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Unless you're the person that used it

637
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And if it turns out to be a success

638
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
This is going to be something that's going on with

639
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
All their titles going forward

640
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Well what's also interesting about this

641
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Capcom actually issued somewhat of an apology

642
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Later in the week a couple days after this news hit

643
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Capcom actually

644
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Sent out a statement

645
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Capcom would like to formally apologize for the issues

646
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Consumers are having with the PS3 version of

647
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Final Five Double Impact

648
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Typically the notification for a required Playstation

649
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Network connection appears in the full game

650
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Description when a game is downloaded from the Playstation

651
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Store

652
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Unfortunately when populating this content

653
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Was overlooked and wasn't included in the

654
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Versions of the game that released in North America

655
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And Asia

656
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
It was included in the release for Europe

657
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Capcom should have checked to make sure the notification

658
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Was included when the final game was made available

659
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And we sincerely apologize for this oversight

660
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
The DRM requirements for Final Five Double Impact

661
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Are not unique to this release

662
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
This protection mechanism has been implemented in numerous

663
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Games offered on the Playstation Store before

664
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Which ones?

665
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Yeah I don't know

666
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
When it was brought to our attention and the notification was missing

667
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
We texted quickly with Sony Computer Entertainment

668
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
America and a fix is on the way

669
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Yay they're gonna fix it

670
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Wait a minute

671
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
They're not really gonna fix the DRM are they?

672
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
They're just gonna fix the description

673
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Probably

674
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
That's the hidden subtext there

675
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
We would like to thank our vigilant fans for bringing this

676
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
To our attention and we will exercise better

677
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Scrutiny on future Capcom releases

678
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Next time we might use some lube

679
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Honestly

680
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Here's the thing

681
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
It sucks that you have to be online

682
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
And yeah okay it will suck that you won't be able to play Final Fight

683
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
If your internet goes out

684
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Big deal

685
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Play something else

686
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I mean seriously

687
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
That can't be the only game you're playing

688
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
And finally I mean really the whole reason they're doing this

689
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Is because people are exploiting a feature

690
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
In the Playstation 3

691
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
That's really meant for if your system craps out

692
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
So you can redownload your content

693
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Do you really want that to be removed?

694
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Later on you know cause you have people

695
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Complaining about it and then your console dies

696
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Oh guess what you gotta download everything again

697
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Oh I mean you have to rebuy everything again

698
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Well I mean you're making a good point

699
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Loki but at the same time

700
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I just don't like this

701
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I have nothing to back that up

702
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I just don't like it

703
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
But no I'm not the only one

704
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
And isn't this just inviting

705
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Cause a lot of this is really reminiscent

706
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Whatever the reason is for it

707
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
It really isn't that much different from the Ubisoft DRM

708
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Please hack me

709
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Please find a workaround for this

710
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Please pretty please

711
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Hackers of America, break me

712
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
It's the same type of logic

713
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
That you know you apply to children

714
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Tell them they can't do something

715
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
What do they want to do? Do it

716
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Why don't they just send a fancy wedding invitation

717
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
On the fancy paper that says you are cordially invited

718
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
To hack the fuck out of this game

719
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Cause people can't really

720
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Hack the Playstation Network right now

721
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Right now

722
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
It's cause they took the Linux out

723
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
But they'll be back

724
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Okay I'm booting whoever this recruit is

725
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
In the chat room

726
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
New rule, you have to have a nickname

727
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Well you would have to have one if you want me to read your name

728
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Cause otherwise there's nothing to read

729
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
When you guys make a lovely Jack comments

730
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Why are you booting a recruit?

731
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Jamie's on the warpath tonight

732
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I'm getting sick of people who just come in and ghost

733
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And if you want to ghost like make

734
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I am a ghost for your nickname

735
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
But otherwise don't just be there

736
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Maybe they don't have anything to say right now

737
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
They could be a spy

738
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
They're not a spy

739
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
What's going to stop a spy from just saying

740
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I'm a normal person

741
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Okay they gave themselves a name

742
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Right as soon as they gave themselves a name

743
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
They got kicked

744
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
See you guys are mean

745
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Alright chat.orangelsonsready.com

746
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Some actual comments from chat

747
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Bochikawa whether or not they want to get more sales

748
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Still makes a hassle for the regular legitimate user

749
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
That's going to cost them sales from people not liking the hassle

750
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
You know Loki not everybody's home is wired to be on the internet all the time

751
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Then how are you going to download the damn game

752
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Well not wired to be on the internet the whole time

753
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
What possible situation would you have

754
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Other than your internet going out

755
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
That you would not be on the internet

756
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
You can't dial up

757
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
You can't dial up and download

758
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Maybe not everybody has wireless internet in their house

759
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
So they actually run a wire when they want to download something

760
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Then they pull the wire when they're done

761
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
So they're going to have to run that wire every time they want to play the game

762
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
All the way in the kid's bedroom or something

763
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I don't know just

764
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I don't think Final Fight is a really good kid's game

765
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
When I say kid it could be a 15, 16 year old where you know

766
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
If I had a 16 year old I wouldn't care if he was playing Final Fight

767
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I can think of worse games

768
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Even if there are training hookers

769
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I'm sure they have

770
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
You know a computer

771
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Download MAME download the ROM done

772
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Look at that don't even have to be connected to the internet

773
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
And it doesn't cost you anything

774
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Frisbee says in what incentive does paying for DRM

775
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Infective programs give?

776
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
So I think the subtext I'm reading there is that

777
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
When you know this is the case you should just not buy it

778
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Or buy it on our system

779
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I did buy it on Xbox I had no idea this is the case

780
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Apparently a lot of people bought it on Xbox

781
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Because this took a few days to come out

782
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
The news which maybe says something right there

783
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I don't know

784
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Regardless we're going to see the DRM mania

785
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Continue for the next few years I'm sure

786
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
As we get into the next system

787
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
That sounds like a photoshop to me

788
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Just take DRM mania and remove the U out of it

789
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I was thinking the same thing

790
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
What if the only thing you can find is a percussion freaks machine

791
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Then you're not looking hard enough

792
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Dark Soccer what you got for us

793
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Good news

794
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Marvel vs Capcom 3

795
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
They've released the poster art and there's already speculation

796
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
As to who is going to be in the game

797
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
So it goes without saying that everything we said last week

798
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Yeah it happened

799
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
So of course for the confirmed characters we have

800
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Morgan

801
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Chris Redfield

802
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Wolverine

803
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Hulk

804
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Iron Man

805
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Is Chris Redfield the Jill sandwich guy?

806
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Shirmi's trying to get out

807
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Yeah from Resident Evil

808
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Him vs the Hulk I'm surprised he hasn't been stepped on and just gone squish

809
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
The little trailer they put up was pretty freaking cool

810
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
What did you think of the art style in it?

811
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I liked it

812
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
It totally made me think of Street Fighter 4

813
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I've heard some mixed things on it

814
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Not everybody I've talked to was a fan of the art style in the trailer

815
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Well they can suck it

816
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
It's just like Tatsunoko vs Capcom if you ask me

817
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,000
At any rate the speculation on who the other characters are and a lot of these I actually

818
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Although I have a few speculations of my own from this

819
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
They're showing Felicia

820
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Super Scroll

821
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Captain America

822
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Doctor Doom

823
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Although I'm sort of thinking Taskmaster

824
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Maybe

825
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Deadpool of course duh

826
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Chun Li who cares

827
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Question mark person

828
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Oh yay question mark person

829
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I just happened to be looking

830
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
And they haven't identified that person yet

831
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
There's one back there that could be Iron Fist

832
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Black Widow or someone else

833
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Dante

834
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
And Frank West

835
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Fuck yes to Frank West

836
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Hell yes

837
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
And looking at some of these others

838
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
They're actually even speculating

839
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Some of the

840
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
They're speculating Trish maybe

841
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And a few other kinda

842
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I would say

843
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Kinda niche

844
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Marvel people not really niche

845
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
It's just you have to really be fans of the books that they're in

846
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Well if that rumor that came up last week

847
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Is true that it's gonna have just a

848
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Mass amount of characters in it

849
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I think they're gonna have to get a little niche

850
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Yeah Dormammu

851
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Is in it well they're saying

852
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Mephisto got crossed out I think that's funny

853
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
But yeah

854
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I don't care I just want it

855
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And you're just gonna play Deadpool all day

856
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
You know just Deadpool all day long

857
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
He has to talk the whole time though

858
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
It's not Deadpool if he does not talk

859
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Your ass off the entire game

860
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
So they're gonna have to pay his voice actor a lot

861
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
We'll see what happens

862
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And I also want the guy to do the voice actor

863
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Who does Deadpool in Friends

864
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Now there was some reaction in our chat room

865
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
To you going over those names

866
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
We had Act Deaf yelled out Deadpool

867
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
And then Yland

868
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Followed that up by saying Be Arthur

869
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Now I

870
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I don't remember what capcom game

871
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Be Arthur was in was there a Golden Girls game

872
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
No I have to explain this

873
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Deadpool

874
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Has or had

875
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
A major obsession with Be Arthur

876
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
And who doesn't

877
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
As in like

878
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
She was his hot chick ideal

879
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Who's Be Arthur

880
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
And I think it's funny how people have paid attention

881
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
To that cause like in the Deadpool in Friends

882
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
PSA things that are out

883
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
In Deadpool's

884
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Apartment on there he's like don't you wish your girlfriend

885
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Was hot like bee

886
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
With a picture of Be Arthur

887
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I never knew that

888
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
You know I only you know I don't really read

889
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Comics that's no secret you know I just

890
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Don't but I liked the character

891
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
In the what Iron Man movie

892
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
When Ryan Reynolds played Deadpool

893
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
He played Wade

894
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Well he was funny

895
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
That's pretty much the type of non stop

896
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Talking your ear off

897
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I want to hear except you know more nuts

898
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Cause he is crazy

899
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
So sadly

900
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
They weren't talking about any

901
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Type of like actual Be Arthur

902
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Being in the game

903
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Now they're bringing a Deadpool and of course

904
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Deadpool has to be followed by Be Arthur and

905
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Someone hasn't said Chimichangas

906
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Why wasn't there a Golden Girls

907
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Video game actually can you imagine

908
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Like firing up you know Playstation Network

909
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
You know and hopefully the DRM

910
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
The cheesecake is a lie

911
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
That's right and then you know you just turn it on

912
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
And then

913
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
The cheesecake is a lie

914
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
What exactly would you do in the Golden Girls video game

915
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Eat cheesecake

916
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
The plan should be a hoe

917
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Sophia would be angry

918
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
She'd have her anger snark meter

919
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
You know what

920
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I would like to see this as an XNA game

921
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Like I realize you can't do a Golden Girls

922
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
XNA game cause copyright IP

923
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
But there's no reason you couldn't do a

924
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Senior

925
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Silver Ladies

926
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
The Silver Ladies

927
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
You know adventure game

928
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Or something

929
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I always thought it was funny that Estelle Getty played Be Arthur's character's mom

930
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Yet she was younger

931
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
That's what they call makeup

932
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I love Estelle Getty

933
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I like Be Arthur too I used to watch Mod

934
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Re-runs of Mod

935
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I love them both rest in peace

936
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Betty White hosting Saturday Night Live

937
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Next week by the way

938
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Betty White doing a roast

939
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I saw her

940
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
It was something else that she was

941
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Participating in a roast for somebody

942
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
She is snarky

943
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I love her

944
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I'll tell YYR to get right on it

945
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Please make that happen

946
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I don't care who does it

947
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
We need that to happen

948
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Rama says call it three old biddies

949
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Actually weren't there four

950
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
One was the mom so whatever

951
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
SSG100Matt says wait wait

952
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Is this an OLR dream game?

953
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
This is a Rob Roberts dream game

954
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Three biddies in the ho

955
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I don't think it's just me

956
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I was listening to

957
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
The Warcraft outsiders

958
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
In the car

959
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
They're another all game show

960
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Michelle and John I think his name

961
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I think Michelle's sister was the guest this week

962
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
And she was talking about that she named her character

963
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Spornak

964
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And wow

965
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
This is my new favorite

966
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Person that I've ever heard on a podcast

967
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
She named her character

968
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
After the Golden Girls and I think Michelle

969
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Or somebody else popped in and said yeah I named one of my

970
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I named one of my priests

971
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Betty Smite

972
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
And I was like this is

973
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
That's it my next

974
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
My next

975
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Star Trek character

976
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Is gonna be

977
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I'm just gonna name her Sophia the old

978
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
And pick like

979
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
The old person face and everything

980
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
And make her super short and Ferengi

981
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I'm gonna put that on the list of people I want to have

982
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
On OLR in the future the chick that named her character

983
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Spornak

984
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Cause that's awesome you're a true inspiration

985
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
To us all alright

986
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Let's move on to other gaming news

987
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Loki's just sitting here going

988
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
What is this show tonight?

989
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I don't know

990
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Well

991
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Just like Nintendo to delay some stuff

992
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Actually just like anybody to delay some stuff

993
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
But Nintendo

994
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
In this particular instance has delayed

995
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Two upcoming games that are very

996
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Highly anticipated

997
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Including Sin and Punishment Star Successor

998
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
And Metroid Other M

999
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Sin and Punishment has only been pushed back a few weeks

1000
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
From June 7th to June 27th

1001
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
And unfortunately

1002
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Though the

1003
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Metroid Other M game

1004
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Which was originally due on

1005
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
June 27th

1006
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Well that's been pushed all the way to August 31st

1007
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
No that was the day after my birthday and I'm gonna have to wait

1008
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Two more months

1009
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
That gives me enough time to actually hook up

1010
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
My Nintendo Wii again

1011
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I haven't plugged it in since I moved

1012
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Why are these games being delayed Loki?

1013
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
No reason was given

1014
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Other than it's Nintendo just

1015
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Doing Nintendo things

1016
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Do you think that maybe the

1017
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Games aren't finished

1018
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Or they failed some type of quality check or what?

1019
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I don't think that they're not finished yet

1020
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I think that they're just

1021
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Spacing out their titles

1022
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
For the rest of the year

1023
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
They had two games coming out in June

1024
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
That really didn't have anything on the plate

1025
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
For the rest of the summer

1026
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
And maybe polishing

1027
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Metroid Other M a little bit more

1028
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Or maybe

1029
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
They're gonna add some gimmicky

1030
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Crap to add onto it

1031
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I hope that god they're not delaying this

1032
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
To add on some like vitality

1033
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Sensor support or some crap like that

1034
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Oh I hope not either

1035
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Well uh

1036
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
At least you'll get the plate at E3 I'm sure

1037
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Yeah I guess that's true

1038
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Alright well all this news

1039
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
About the Nintendo Wii and the delays

1040
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Leads me into a little something

1041
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I want to do on tonight's show

1042
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
We don't do this very often especially on the podcast

1043
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
But we're gonna do a little something called

1044
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Secret Club tonight is what we're gonna do

1045
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Here on the show

1046
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
That's right Secret Club

1047
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
It's a secret to everyone

1048
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Alright

1049
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Here's the deal with Secret Club

1050
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I have a secret and I want to tell you guys

1051
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Cause I can't keep secrets to myself

1052
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
And this is one of those things where somebody said

1053
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Hey Rob I found out this secret and you know I don't really care

1054
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
If you talk about it on your show

1055
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
So of course I've got a big mouth

1056
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
And I'm gonna tell you guys

1057
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
There's actually two kinds of secrets

1058
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Cause you know I do have friends that work with games

1059
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
So if you tell anyone this I'm gonna beat your fucking ass with my shoe

1060
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Those I don't tell anybody

1061
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
But then there's the ones that's like

1062
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Hey Rob I found out this little piece of news

1063
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
And I don't care who you tell

1064
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
So this is a little something secret

1065
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
But you didn't hear it from me

1066
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Cause you know due to things that have happened in the past on this show

1067
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I don't really want to get

1068
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
You know I don't think

1069
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
OLR really gains anything

1070
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
From you know having broken the news first

1071
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Or what have you

1072
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
But it's a little secret something something

1073
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I didn't hear it here but you heard it

1074
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
The Black Nintendo Wii

1075
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Is coming

1076
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
And it's coming soon

1077
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I have it on good authority from a friend

1078
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
That works for a major

1079
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Store that sells a lot of

1080
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Game hardware and video games

1081
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
That there was some type of

1082
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Alert this week that they're going to be getting

1083
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
A large shipment of Black Nintendo

1084
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Wiis on May

1085
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
23rd is the release date of the

1086
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Black Wii and apparently this actually

1087
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Ties into something we've heard about before because

1088
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
This is the bundle that's also going to include

1089
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
We're not sure and

1090
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
The details were a little sketchy from

1091
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
My source cause he couldn't remember if it was

1092
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
That it was coming with just the

1093
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Wii Motion Plus or if it was

1094
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
The Wii Motion Plus and Wii Sports

1095
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Resort It's Wii Sports Resort and Wii Motion Plus

1096
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
But Loki has previously heard of

1097
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
That there was going to be a new bundle that matched

1098
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
What we saw at Walmart before but we're

1099
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Putting two and two together

1100
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
What Loki had probably heard about before is actually going to be this

1101
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Black Nintendo Wii bundle

1102
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
That's right

1103
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
There was no color specifications

1104
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Or anything just basically that they're

1105
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Going to be releasing new bundles soon

1106
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
And that

1107
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
We probably weren't going to get any

1108
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Cause they're dicks

1109
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
And folks from chat

1110
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I haven't heard anything else about the specs

1111
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
No it's not HD, dream on guys

1112
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
It's just a Wii

1113
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
It's the Wii, it's the same damn Wii

1114
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Except here's the difference, instead of

1115
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
White plastic

1116
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
They used black plastic

1117
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
That's it, don't expect

1118
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Anything else, so sorry

1119
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
It's not HD

1120
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
And it may be an extra free game cause I'm assuming they're also

1121
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Including Wii Sports in there so you get

1122
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Wii Sports and Wii

1123
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Sports Resort, it'd be nice if they added another

1124
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Controller into it

1125
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I doubt it

1126
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I think it's supposed to be the same price

1127
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
It is, it's going to be the exact

1128
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I must have forgot to say that, it is the exact

1129
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Same price as the Wii you're paying for today

1130
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
So in a way it's a bit of a price drop too

1131
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I wonder what they're going to do with

1132
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I think it actually may be replacing

1133
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
The old Wii SKUs

1134
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
So white Wiis are going to be rare

1135
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
That's right, super rare

1136
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
TigerClaw in chat says a black Wii is a no brainer

1137
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
We sort of had a hint of that recently

1138
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
When we saw a black Wiimote on the most recent trailer

1139
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
For Metroid Other M, well they're already selling black Wiimotes

1140
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Yeah they are

1141
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
And then the folks overseas are saying

1142
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
We've already had the black Wii

1143
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Hey hey hey hey hey

1144
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I'm not controlling the news

1145
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I don't write the news, I just report it

1146
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
The black Wii is not out in the states

1147
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
So they're finally getting it

1148
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
May 23rd, and that's what I'm telling you

1149
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Is the date, May 23rd

1150
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Alright

1151
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Yeah it's already been out in other parts of the world

1152
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Don't they have other colors too?

1153
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Like remember E3 years ago there was like a pink Wii

1154
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
And a blue Wii and all this other stuff

1155
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I don't know

1156
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Let's see Tiger, no I'm sorry

1157
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
SHA100Matt says so wait the black Wii isn't bigger than the white Wii?

1158
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Ha ha ha

1159
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Ha ha ha everybody's a jokester here at Orange Laundry

1160
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Ha ha ha

1161
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Going back to something we were talking about a little bit earlier

1162
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
TigerClaw sent me this link in chat

1163
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
And I just have to share this with you guys

1164
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
This link on YouTube that is just pretty fabulous here

1165
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
This is what could be

1166
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
It's an actual, somebody did this on the NES

1167
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
It's like a hack or something

1168
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I don't know what

1169
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I don't know what that is

1170
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Some type of like hacked NES cartridge or something

1171
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
So somebody's already started making my dream game

1172
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Alright

1173
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Let's move on to some real games shall we

1174
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
How about Halo? Hey don't tune out

1175
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Halo, I've got Halo updates

1176
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Halo, Halo Reach specifically

1177
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Halo Reach apparently

1178
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Is going to, well you know

1179
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Who knew? Halo Reach

1180
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Is going to have all different types of releases

1181
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
It's not just going to be regular Halo Reach

1182
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
But there's going to be a bunch

1183
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Of other types of Halo Reaches coming out

1184
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
This is a leak from a Best Buy

1185
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Ad apparently

1186
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
60 bucks if you want to just get Halo Reach by itself

1187
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
150 dollars

1188
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
For the legendary edition

1189
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
And there's going to be a limited edition

1190
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Of Halo Reach, it's going to be 80 dollars

1191
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Standard version is just the game itself

1192
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Limited version has a special

1193
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Case, collectibles

1194
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
And in-game armor

1195
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
The 150 dollar option

1196
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Apparently has all of that but also has

1197
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I guess more unique packaging and in-game

1198
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Armor, also a legendary

1199
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Noble 6 sculpture

1200
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I don't know if that's anything like

1201
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
The little Master Chief hat that you could put on

1202
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Your cat for lols

1203
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
You couldn't really put it on your cat just so you know

1204
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
But sounds kind of similar

1205
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Can't you still get

1206
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
That Halo 150 dollar edition

1207
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
For like 60 bucks now discounted at price

1208
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
There's people still sitting on that stuff

1209
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I'm not surprised

1210
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Hopefully this will sell a little better but we'll see

1211
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
What do you think about all this game

1212
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Coming out in three different flavors, Loki?

1213
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
They did it with Halo 3

1214
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
And it was kind of fun

1215
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
But hopefully people learned

1216
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
You don't need to spend the money

1217
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
To get a fake helmet

1218
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
At least this has a nice sculpture that comes with it

1219
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I wouldn't pay that though

1220
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Yeah because if you think about it

1221
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
You're basically paying

1222
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Between 80 and 150 you're paying like 70 dollars

1223
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
For the sculpture, you could use that money to get

1224
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Another game if you wanted

1225
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Or you could use it to

1226
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Invest

1227
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
And have 200 dollars

1228
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Next year

1229
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
But there it is

1230
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I realize there are the fans that will pay

1231
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
That money to have every little thing Halo

1232
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
And who am I to criticize

1233
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
If it was Final Fantasy 14 I'd probably be doing the same thing

1234
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I'd be like 150 dollars that's it

1235
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I'm paying the money right now

1236
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Shh

1237
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Well we've got some word from

1238
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Bimani style about Stride Nasty stuff

1239
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
That's sponsoring it

1240
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
And keep in mind I am completely allergic to it

1241
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
And I don't even like to say the name of it

1242
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
So it's nasty

1243
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
It's Stride Gum

1244
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Nasty

1245
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Save the arcades too

1246
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
But

1247
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Arcade Infinity

1248
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Is actually

1249
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
One of the ones up in the

1250
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Competition for it

1251
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
AI

1252
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Has been like a really big staple

1253
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
In the Bimani community

1254
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
They had all the imports in

1255
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
They also had that weird Gundam game that was so cool

1256
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
And like little Japanese ticket games

1257
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
And Jameralami

1258
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
And it's in LA

1259
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
In case you didn't know

1260
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Well it's in East LA

1261
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
It was born in East LA

1262
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
And also they were selling import cars for a while

1263
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
That's right

1264
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I think the owners were big big big on the import cars

1265
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I think they drove some nice cars

1266
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I actually

1267
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Looked into getting a Skyline from them

1268
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
When I thought I had money

1269
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Nice

1270
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
And that's where Loki did you play some crazy porn game there once

1271
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
That's funny

1272
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I played a lot of crazy porn games there

1273
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
That's where I first played

1274
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Gals Panic and Dancing Eyes

1275
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
But at any rate

1276
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
The competition is going on

1277
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Until June 15th

1278
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
And they're talking about

1279
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
The

1280
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
AI

1281
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
The owner says that if they win they want to get

1282
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Tycho and Juby

1283
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
But you have to

1284
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Play a game of Calbots 2010

1285
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
And get your final score

1286
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
To the arcade you wish to support

1287
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
And that's at savethearcades.stridegum.com

1288
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Well I mean

1289
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Is Arcade Infinity in danger of closing or something

1290
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I mean haven't they been threatening to close for a little while now

1291
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I don't see anything really about

1292
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
But they're talking about if they won they'd get a Juby

1293
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Machine and all this other stuff

1294
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Or U-Beat or whatever it's called

1295
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I guess

1296
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Weird

1297
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
We're not picking you up

1298
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I'm talking

1299
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I'm talking in the mic

1300
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Alright

1301
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Well if you want to support them then there you go

1302
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
You can go play that little game and submit your score

1303
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
But then you have to sign up for spam emails

1304
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
So hopefully you have an actual spam email address

1305
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Or something to send stuff to

1306
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Alright let's go around the world

1307
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
And take a look at some upcoming release dates

1308
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
And games

1309
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
That are coming to a living room near you

1310
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Loki

1311
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Yes lots of stuff coming out this week

1312
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Well not a whole ton

1313
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Start things off with

1314
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Super Street Fighter IV

1315
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
That's going to be coming out on PlayStation 3

1316
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
And Xbox 360

1317
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Nier

1318
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
That kind of a beat em up game

1319
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
From Square Enix coming out on PlayStation 3

1320
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
And Xbox 360 this week as well

1321
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Death of the Rights Retribution

1322
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Also on PlayStation 3

1323
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
And Xbox 360

1324
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
You're a fan of

1325
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Sexual Induendo and Boobies

1326
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Record of Argus War

1327
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
The limited edition or the

1328
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
What was it? The naughty

1329
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
I forget the

1330
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Some naughty edition or whatever

1331
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Coming out on Xbox 360 does include

1332
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
A mouse pad with fake boobs on it

1333
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
And a pillow case with some chick on it

1334
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
So that's going to be kind of neat

1335
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Harvest Moon

1336
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Hero of Leaf Valley coming out on

1337
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
PSP

1338
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Splinter Cell Conviction making its way out

1339
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
On PC this week with wonderful

1340
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
DRM in tow

1341
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
And

1342
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Free Running

1343
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
A parkour sim

1344
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Coming out on the Wii this week

1345
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
2010 FIFA World Cup

1346
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
South Africa coming out on

1347
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
PlayStation 3, Xbox 360

1348
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Wii and

1349
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I don't remember

1350
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
And PSP I don't think there's a DS version on that one

1351
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I believe that's it

1352
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Oh no this is actually a pretty good deal

1353
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Pixel Junk Monsters Deluxe

1354
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Making its way out on

1355
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
PSP in the UMD format

1356
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
They've had this originally on

1357
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
The PlayStation Network

1358
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
But now you can buy it on UMD

1359
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Only $10

1360
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
And it includes I believe some of the

1361
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Expansions for that. They're doing the same thing too

1362
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
With Fat Princess coming out a little bit later on

1363
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
In May

1364
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Not a bad thing at all

1365
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Alright. Any of that that you're going to pick up

1366
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Logie?

1367
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I'm going to try Super Street Fighter 4

1368
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
And Nier

1369
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Yeah I'm going to pick up

1370
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Super Street Fighter 4

1371
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
But this time I'm getting it on PS3

1372
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Because I would like to actually be able to control it better

1373
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
So that's my whole thought there

1374
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
This way you get arcade sticks Rob

1375
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Or just play it over here

1376
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
And you're talking more money

1377
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
But they're worth it

1378
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Xbox 360 in Japan

1379
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Sees the release of Super Street Fighter 4

1380
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
This week as well in a regular and

1381
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Collectors Edition

1382
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Otherwise Splinter Cell Conviction is your other big release in Japan

1383
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
This week. See some of the same games we're getting here

1384
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Also get released in Japan at the same time

1385
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Imagine that

1386
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Looking at some other consoles

1387
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Going over to the PlayStation 3

1388
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Same same. They also get Super Street Fighter 4

1389
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Over there

1390
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Regular and Collectors Edition

1391
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
World Soccer winning 11 2010 gets a price reduction

1392
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
For whatever that's worth

1393
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
If you're a big fan of these soccer sims

1394
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
On the Nintendo Wii

1395
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Not really a lot this week

1396
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Base Fishing Wii World Tournament

1397
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Andukensa X and a game called

1398
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Rooms comes out as well

1399
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
From Hudson. That's all on the Nintendo Wii this week

1400
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
On the PlayStation 2

1401
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I like the name of this game

1402
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Love Route Zero

1403
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Kiss Kiss Labyrinth

1404
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Yes that's really the name of the game

1405
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Love Route Zero

1406
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Kiss Kiss Labyrinth

1407
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
It's an adventure game

1408
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
You can get shots

1409
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
But the box art looks to be like

1410
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
All these dudes in school outfits

1411
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
But there's this girl who looks like the prom queen

1412
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Yeah why am I trying to figure this out?

1413
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
None of you are going to play it

1414
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I already know that. None of you are going to play it

1415
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Going on to the handheld systems

1416
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
And looking at what is coming out

1417
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
On the Nintendo DS

1418
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 2

1419
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Is a big release from Squeenix this week

1420
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
On the Nintendo DS

1421
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
And lastly on the Sony PSP

1422
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Ikitosan Cross Impact

1423
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
And that cross is spelled with an actual X

1424
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Just to be complicated

1425
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
That is coming out in Japan

1426
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
This week

1427
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
That is a sequel to a former

1428
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
PSP game

1429
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
2D scrolling action

1430
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
22 girls in this beat em up game

1431
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
And their clothes come off

1432
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Is that really what this is about?

1433
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Well that's what Ikitosan is about

1434
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Based on what I've seen I guess

1435
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Nice

1436
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
They fight and their clothes rip in very

1437
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Evocative ways I guess

1438
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Also Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker

1439
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
I bet some of you guys might want to get that

1440
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
There's also a full PSP pack for that game coming out

1441
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
And I just like the name of this game

1442
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Marriage Royale Prism Story

1443
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Is also coming out

1444
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
It's an adventure game

1445
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I don't really know what happens in this game

1446
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I guess it's like you play the girl going to get married

1447
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
But I want to point this out there's a screenshot here

1448
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Where you have these three cute little anime girls

1449
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
They're like working out or something

1450
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
That is tragic

1451
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Um actually

1452
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
No I know it's like a swimsuit

1453
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
You know how girls wear the one piece and put the shirt on

1454
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
No no Rob actually that's what

1455
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Um gym uniforms look like

1456
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Really? Yeah they're the little bloomer

1457
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Shorts How's that not caught on over here?

1458
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Cause we're prudes

1459
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Clearly

1460
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
So

1461
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Alright so if you want some

1462
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
You know culturally different things

1463
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
There you can check out that game

1464
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
You probably won't

1465
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Alright how about the UK DarkSakura

1466
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Yeah how about em

1467
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
On the 28th serious Sam HD

1468
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
The second encounter

1469
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
The 30th 2010 FIFA World Cup

1470
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Yay

1471
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
30th God of War Collection

1472
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Iron Man 2

1473
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Splinter Cell Conviction

1474
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Super Street Fighter 4

1475
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
WarioWare Do It Yourself

1476
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
And Wings of Prey

1477
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
That's it

1478
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Too bad it's not the birds of prey

1479
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Making it's way to a video game

1480
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
That would be kinda awesome

1481
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Or not

1482
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Alright Loki

1483
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Ah yes

1484
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Um

1485
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Okay so we talked a little bit

1486
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Well I said that we had

1487
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Splinter Cell Conviction

1488
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Coming out this week and there's horrible

1489
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
DRM in tow well that might not be

1490
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
That big of a problem

1491
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Apparently the hacker community

1492
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Which I thought this happened weeks ago but

1493
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Maybe they finally figured out

1494
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
How to do it the correct way

1495
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
They have found a way to get rid of the

1496
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
DRM

1497
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
That's in

1498
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
These titles that are being released from

1499
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
MovieSoft including Assassin's Creed 2

1500
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
And Settlers 7

1501
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
And I'm assuming

1502
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Splinter Cell Conviction coming soon

1503
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
It should be easy to modify the work

1504
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
With that and the hacker group of course

1505
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Um

1506
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Involved in doing that was

1507
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I believe

1508
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Skid Row

1509
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Fun name

1510
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Awesome

1511
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
And you know it is a little bit different

1512
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Before they had different hacks that were

1513
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Just emulating

1514
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
The authentication server

1515
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Or they were

1516
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Finding some way to trick this but this

1517
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Actually removes the DRM from

1518
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
The title so

1519
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Um that's interesting

1520
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Now Loki your pal Bobby Blackwolf in chat says

1521
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
The hack before worked

1522
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Up until a certain point of the game

1523
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Then it locked up so this must be news

1524
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
That now it's working for the entire game

1525
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
There you go

1526
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
So Loki

1527
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
I mean does this really

1528
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Surprise you because I kind of look at this and go

1529
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Yeah I already thought this happened too

1530
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I thought this happened within days after the DRM

1531
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I'm not surprised

1532
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Especially you know something like

1533
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
This that's annoying a lot of people

1534
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Not only

1535
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
The fact that they're coming out and saying oh

1536
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
This is going to stop piracy for all of our titles

1537
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
It just goes to show

1538
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
You're going to waste money on this

1539
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I mean it slows people down but it

1540
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Definitely doesn't stop it

1541
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
And really in the end the only people that get hurt

1542
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Are the people that legitimately buy the game

1543
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Of course now if you don't like the DRM

1544
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
You can just go search online for the crack

1545
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
So

1546
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Like I just I understand the need for DRM

1547
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Like I'm not like somebody who says

1548
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Oh every game should just like

1549
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Not have DRM at all

1550
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I just think what Ubisoft was doing was overkill

1551
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
I mean come on when you disconnect from the internet

1552
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
At all your game dumps

1553
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Like do you know how much I get disconnected from World of Warcraft

1554
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Because Comcast decides to fart on me

1555
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
And it just you know like I'll be in the middle of something

1556
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
And it completely screws up my game

1557
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Like

1558
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Oh my gosh at least that isn't like a long term

1559
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Irritating thing

1560
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Whereas you know I could see if I'm playing through one of these games

1561
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I'm not at a save point maybe I just cleared

1562
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Like a really tough part of the game it's like

1563
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Oh you're screwed you gotta do it again

1564
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Yeah it'd be different if it was like

1565
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Okay we noticed you're you know

1566
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
It disconnected we're saving your progress

1567
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Now

1568
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
And you know you can restart here later once it

1569
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Reconnects

1570
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
I mean that would be semi reasonable

1571
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
To be fair didn't Ubisoft change some of that

1572
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Where it doesn't you don't really get booted

1573
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
For the entire game now or something

1574
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
I don't know

1575
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
But the thing is

1576
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
I'm not buying their games on PC

1577
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Even if it were buying their games

1578
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Which I'm not so

1579
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
I don't know

1580
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Alright

1581
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Well a couple last stories for you guys

1582
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Then we're going to get into the classic game of the week

1583
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Where Dark Soccer is going to walk down the

1584
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Vaults of gaming's history and pick out a game

1585
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
That she thinks you kids ought to check out this week

1586
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
But first something about a newer series

1587
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Something that's kind of been a bit

1588
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Under the radar and I think that is a pity

1589
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
And that is DJ Hero

1590
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
DJ Hero of course we know that DJ Hero

1591
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Is getting a sequel this year

1592
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
And little little details are starting to trickle out

1593
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
About it DJ Shadow

1594
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Apparently is going to be working

1595
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
On the next DJ Hero he actually

1596
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Said in an interview on Radio 1

1597
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
It was interesting I'm actually working

1598
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
On the next one as well but yeah it was a

1599
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Trip so there you go

1600
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
He's going to be in the second game also notable

1601
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
He was in the first game too so he's

1602
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Like a repeat and I kind of figured

1603
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
That would happen is that like how many

1604
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
World famous DJ's are there

1605
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Are there really enough world famous

1606
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
World famous

1607
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
There are a lot of DJ's

1608
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
I think out there that are world famous

1609
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
But you know how many

1610
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Of them are you going to get to

1611
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Be in DJ Hero

1612
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
I was very disappointed that they had

1613
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
DJ Jazzy Jeff and there were no

1614
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
You know

1615
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Will Smith songs in there at all

1616
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
No mixes with Will Smith

1617
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
That was very disappointing

1618
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Well there you go DJ Shadow

1619
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Is going to be in the next game

1620
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
In DJ Hero 2

1621
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
But DJ Hero 1 All Love Is Not Lost

1622
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Loki you'll be happy to hear this

1623
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
There's actually another track pack coming out

1624
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Yeah this one I'm actually kind of excited about

1625
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Last one kind of sucked

1626
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Darude's Sandstorm

1627
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Mixed with Josh Winke's Higher

1628
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
State of Consciousness is one of the songs

1629
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
In the new DLC

1630
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Danny Bird's Red Mist

1631
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
VIP is coming

1632
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Out as well and then this song

1633
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Wolfgang Gartner's Wolfgang's

1634
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
5th Symphony Let me start off by

1635
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Saying that this song reminded me of something

1636
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
That you would see in DDR

1637
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Here's a little clip of what this song

1638
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Sounds like

1639
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:45,000
It's a little noisy for me

1640
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Sounds like a remix song from Boom Boom Rocket

1641
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Remember how Boom Boom Rocket had nothing

1642
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
But classical remixes

1643
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
And it's really hard too

1644
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Like that's the other catch is that the song is

1645
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Incredibly hard and I guess all these songs that are in

1646
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
This pack are supposed to be a very high difficulty

1647
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Hence why they are calling it

1648
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
The Domination Pack

1649
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Because you can't just say it normally

1650
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
It's the Domination Pack

1651
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Yippie Skippy

1652
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Are we going to be dominated?

1653
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Apparently you will be dominated

1654
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
By the Domination Pack

1655
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
So

1656
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
But yeah I guess that song sounded okay

1657
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
It's a little noisy for me

1658
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
But I guess that's because there was so much mixing going on

1659
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
I don't know

1660
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
I think that that's the thing

1661
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Some of the effects are a little overdone

1662
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
There's people that are going to like it

1663
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Don't get me wrong

1664
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Alright I don't know if I'll buy it

1665
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
I'm curious to hear what the other songs sound like though

1666
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Anyhow let's get to the part of the show

1667
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Where we like to take a trip down the

1668
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Halls of gaming history

1669
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Dark Soccer

1670
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Dark Soccer is going to jump into the vault

1671
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
And dive in and find a game

1672
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
That she says hey you ungrateful little

1673
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Children

1674
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Because she says that a lot

1675
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Not teaching him Doctor Who references

1676
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
I didn't teach him that

1677
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
He watches Doctor Who

1678
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
You kids ought to be

1679
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Playing this classic video game

1680
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
So you can see where the games of today came from

1681
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Dark Soccer what is the

1682
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Classic video game of the week this week?

1683
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Warcraft Orcs and Humans

1684
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Oh snap

1685
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
I didn't put this in for all of you addicts

1686
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Who don't know your roots

1687
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Fair enough

1688
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Warcraft Orcs and Humans

1689
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Freaking boring ass game

1690
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
This game is awesome

1691
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Shut your mouth

1692
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
See I wanted that reaction

1693
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
So I didn't put this in

1694
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Really for me

1695
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Because I hate real time strategy games

1696
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I don't like them I do not have fun with them

1697
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
But

1698
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
There are enough of you

1699
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
That don't know where your game came from

1700
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Sorry

1701
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
No it's true there's not

1702
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
There's a lot of people that play World of Warcraft

1703
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
That never played a Warcraft game before

1704
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
I mean it's worth noting

1705
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I actually mentioned to someone

1706
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
When World of Warcraft just came out

1707
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Did you play Warcraft before?

1708
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
No it just came out

1709
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Poor childhood

1710
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
I see so tonight is about edumacation

1711
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
It's about edumacation

1712
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
It's a real time strategy game

1713
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
It came out in 1994

1714
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
November 1984 and came out on the Mac in 96

1715
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
And

1716
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
It was a sequel Warcraft 2 Tides of Darkness

1717
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
And then of course

1718
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Warcraft 3

1719
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Warcraft 3 came out not too long ago

1720
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
If you look on Dan's little shelf there

1721
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
He's got a copy

1722
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
So Dan obviously likes it

1723
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
And

1724
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
It's basically

1725
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
You know like I said real time strategy

1726
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Where you have the humans of Azeroth

1727
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Against the invading orcs

1728
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
And then both sides have to

1729
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Fight off wild monsters

1730
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Sometimes you can

1731
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Enlist the monsters

1732
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
So basically

1733
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
You've got your melee groups

1734
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
You have ranged groups and spellcasters

1735
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
It is built

1736
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Off of the Dune 2

1737
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Gameplay

1738
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Which is like build a base, build an army

1739
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Destroy the enemy

1740
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Blah blah blah

1741
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Different mission types where you have

1742
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Rebels of each player

1743
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
So you can

1744
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Rescue, rebuild towns

1745
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
And friendly forces

1746
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
And do all this other stuff

1747
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
And you also have to be able to

1748
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Efficiently use your platoon

1749
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Also

1750
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
In one mission you have to kill the orc chief's

1751
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Daughter or something

1752
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
It also

1753
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Let you use

1754
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Lands

1755
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
So that you could play against each other

1756
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
So it had that

1757
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Start of the MMO remember

1758
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Sorta yeah

1759
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Like the old school battle net

1760
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
But I was more Diablo

1761
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
On battle net

1762
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Well you have to go through

1763
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
With this you also have to cultivate

1764
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Your resources

1765
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Be careful about where you dig for gold

1766
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Where you chop your wood

1767
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
If you exhaust your resources

1768
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Then you have to get them

1769
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Differently

1770
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
You have to basically

1771
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Regrow your forest while you're taking

1772
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
From them, you have different types of magical

1773
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Buildings, you have

1774
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Different types of sorcerers

1775
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Like you have a cleric, you can have

1776
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Necrolite that raises skeletons

1777
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Ooh

1778
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Elementals, that type of thing

1779
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
The conjurer versus

1780
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
The warlock you know

1781
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Um

1782
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
And then of course it's sort of an overhead

1783
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Interface

1784
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
And it's a click and point

1785
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Um

1786
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Yeah you know

1787
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
It actually

1788
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Was

1789
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
I see I thought

1790
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
That it was

1791
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I played some a little bit but like I said I don't really care for

1792
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
RTS games

1793
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
They just I'm sort of like what

1794
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
I can play them and I'm good at them

1795
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I'm just sort of like what this is boring

1796
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
But

1797
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
It clearly caught on I mean

1798
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Cause remember we had you know

1799
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Starcraft

1800
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
You know the whole

1801
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
I guess themes to the game sort of caught on

1802
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
To and I mean now we've got World of Warcraft

1803
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Making it you know less sucky

1804
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Again this is Jamie who

1805
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Does not like RTS's

1806
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
I actually own this game

1807
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
And I loved it so

1808
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
There is actually an RTS game

1809
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
That I like but it's a Macross game

1810
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
That came out on um

1811
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
The uh PC Engine CD

1812
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
I will say this though I am weird

1813
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I fully admit I'm weird cause I don't really

1814
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Care for Starcraft and I

1815
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
To this day have never played Warcraft 3

1816
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
You've got it right here

1817
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
I just for some reason have never played it

1818
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
I really should because maybe some of the stuff

1819
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
In World of Warcraft will make more sense

1820
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
But yeah I have played the old school Warcraft

1821
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
And I did play Warcraft 2

1822
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
And I actually tried to make it a point to put in games

1823
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
That I can be really excited about

1824
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
But it was just you know

1825
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
It seemed to me that with everybody

1826
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Being all

1827
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
World of Warcraft World of Warcraft blah blah blah blah

1828
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
You know it helps to know

1829
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Where it came from it helps to go back to your roots

1830
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Um so as

1831
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Far as other um

1832
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Ones that came out though it did have some uh

1833
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Predecessors things that actually

1834
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Um

1835
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Would uh

1836
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Inspire the game and build the

1837
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Groundwork for it there was

1838
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Definitely some competitors

1839
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Um

1840
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Like I said Dune 2

1841
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Um and then Warcraft works and humans

1842
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Came out after that

1843
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Um

1844
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
And then um

1845
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
There was actually a random map generator

1846
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
That was for it

1847
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
And that came from

1848
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Civilization Rob

1849
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Yes

1850
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
I thought that you'd find that interesting

1851
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Um

1852
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Command and Conquer actually um

1853
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Borrowed from

1854
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Warcraft and Age of Empires

1855
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Um put all of them in

1856
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
In the random map generator when it came out

1857
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Um Modern Wars

1858
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Um for the Commodore 64

1859
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
What uh incorporated

1860
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
The use of land play

1861
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
So it really

1862
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Not only was it influenced by

1863
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Some others but it actually pulled influence

1864
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
It's actually even listing realms as

1865
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
An old Amiga and Atari ST

1866
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Um game as being an influence on it

1867
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Um

1868
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
And of course for sequels we got

1869
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Warcraft 2 Tides of Darkness

1870
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
In 95 and

1871
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Warcraft 2 Beyond the Dark Portal in 96

1872
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
And then um

1873
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Coming out later

1874
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Of course was Warcraft 3

1875
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Um Reign of Chaos

1876
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
And then there was Starcraft like I said

1877
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
And Starcraft Brood War and

1878
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
World of Warcraft

1879
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
And soon as Starcraft 2 for you RTS fans

1880
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Yeah I was about to get to that

1881
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
So yeah Warcraft you know

1882
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
It's expanded there's

1883
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Card games, comics, there's a ton of books

1884
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
You've seen the books I'm sure

1885
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
They actually um there's actually

1886
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
A film called Warcraft

1887
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
In production to be out in 2011

1888
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Yeah Spider-Man dude's

1889
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Doing it right?

1890
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Yeah I think there's also um

1891
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
There's board games too

1892
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Um but yeah

1893
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Warcraft it really did

1894
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Kinda spur a whole you know

1895
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
A whole big thing

1896
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
11 million people

1897
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Can't be wrong or can they?

1898
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Addicts

1899
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Addicts

1900
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Your classic game of the week a true

1901
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Classic indeed in every way

1902
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Shape and form don't listen to Dark Sakura

1903
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
No I'm not saying it's a

1904
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Bad game I'm saying I don't like

1905
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
RTS's

1906
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
And I and even that's including

1907
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Actraiser Warcraft oh you

1908
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Don't like Actraiser I didn't say I don't

1909
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Like Actraiser Actraiser

1910
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Is a good game I get bored

1911
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Bored bored after a while

1912
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
I'm gonna cry alright

1913
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Oh Rob there's a there's a difference

1914
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Between thinking something is crap

1915
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
And just not liking the genre of it

1916
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Yeah

1917
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
I can see that I'm trying to think if there's something

1918
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
I feel that way about I do every so often like

1919
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
You know smiting people in Actraiser

1920
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
See I would say that's how I feel about

1921
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Sports games but like I can go back and play

1922
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Old school sports games no problem like I love Tecmo

1923
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Bowl, Blades of Steel like the way they used to be before they

1924
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Just got super high impact like

1925
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Yeah before they got like really complicated

1926
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
But that that's my point you know

1927
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
I I'll start playing and I'll be like yeah

1928
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
This is cool then I'm like uh huh

1929
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
I will say

1930
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Not my thing I might have liked Warcraft

1931
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
But I wasn't very good at it I never got very

1932
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Far in it like I'm not good

1933
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
At RTS's

1934
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
This whole thing I can

1935
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Do the strategy just fine

1936
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
I just get bored with it it's not

1937
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Really my thing

1938
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Alright fair enough

1939
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000

Of NBA Jam

1947

01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
To add it to the collection because we have everything else

1957
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
We want

1958
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000

01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Hey guys that's the end of part A

1989
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
But we still have plenty more show to come

1990
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
We have more to come in part B tonight

1991

Including some other news

1992
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Out of the Capcom event this week

1993
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
I mean a lot of it we reported last week as rumors

1994
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
They've turned to fact

1995
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
But we do have some extra details to come with that

1996
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
We'll get into that as well

1997
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Some big rumored games for Xbox Live Arcade

1998
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000

01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000

On this lovely Sunday evening

2008
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
The 25th of April 2010

2009
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
For episode 364

2010
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Of our little program where we talk about

2011
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Video games and

2012
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
It's been a fun show so far tonight

2013
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
We've had news about DJ Hero

2014
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Yes even a type of

2015
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Food company that apparently Jamie won't say

2016
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Where they save the arcades at

2017
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Campaigns some Marvel vs. Capcom news

2018
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
DRM debates

2019
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Television on the Xbox and plenty more news

2020
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
To go through this week

2021
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Loki why don't you start us off with some fast

2022
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
News tonight

2023
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Yes there's some WiiWare releases

2024
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Coming soon on

2025
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
May 17th

2026
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Including that well

2027
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
The next title in the Bit.Trip

2028
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Series Bit.Trip Runner

2029
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Will be coming out that day on WiiWare

2030
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
And also there's some

2031
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Summer DSiWare release

2032
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Dates as well to share

2033
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Including Photo Dojo

2034
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Which looks like a side scrolling

2035
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Fighting game that uses a DSi's

2036
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Camera to add you to

2037
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
The game

2038
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
That's kind of neat I guess

2039
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Kind of gimmicky but fun

2040
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Earthworm Jim

2041
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Coming out also on

2042
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
May 10th

2043
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
And apparently I guess that's going to be an

2044
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Update to the SNES version

2045
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Of the game

2046
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Really

2047
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Another Frogger game

2048
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Frogger returns

2049
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Yet again on

2050
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
People must be buying them Loki

2051
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
May 24th

2052
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Konami has Frogger

2053
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Metal Torrent

2054
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
On May 24th

2055
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Is a

2056
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Kira developed Shmup game

2057
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
It looks pretty awesome

2058
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Xscape

2059
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Is I guess a

2060
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Sequel to Game Boy

2061
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Title

2062
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Or I guess a title X

2063
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
From Q Games

2064
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
And it's like a first person

2065
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Tank combat game

2066
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
But really trippy looking

2067
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
And then some other stuff

2068
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Coming out

2069
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Hero of Sparta

2070
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
On May 31st

2071
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Flame Trail on June 7th

2072
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
And Akapa's Trail on

2073
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
June 14th

2074
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Then also another title that's going to be

2075
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Coming soon

2076
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
This is kind of a pseudo

2077
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
3D game

2078
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Luxley's

2079
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Lineup

2080
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
And what's kind of unique about this

2081
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
This is a game that came out in Japan

2082
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
On DSiWare as well

2083
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
And it's kind of a 3D game

2084
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
It uses the

2085
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
DSi's camera

2086
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
To kind of trick the user

2087
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Into

2088
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Viewing the environment

2089
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
In kind of a 3D dimensional fashion

2090
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
You basically tilt the screen around

2091
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
And doing so will change your perspective

2092
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
In the game

2093
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
And it's basically kind of a hidden

2094
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Objects game I guess

2095
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
It looks kind of cool

2096
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Coming out as well

2097
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
And then non-DSi related

2098
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Stuff

2099
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Battlefield Heroes

2100
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Is going to be getting some more

2101
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Upgrades

2102
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
In the form of

2103
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Jetpacks

2104
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
As well as some new maps and

2105
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
New game mode

2106
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
They're going to be getting

2107
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
That's funny

2108
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
I forgot that they had the

2109
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Michael Jackson content that one time

2110
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Anyways

2111
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
I guess they're going to be getting

2112
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
A new map

2113
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Called Midnight Mayhem

2114
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
And a new mode that's going to be called

2115
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
V2 Vengeance

2116
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Where players must capture and control

2117
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
A giant rocket

2118
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
But hey

2119
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Look, see they're

2120
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Bringing out jetpacks before Halo Reach

2121
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Can

2122
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Do you think that's why they're doing it?

2123
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Maybe

2124
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Maybe to get the jump on it?

2125
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
I don't know

2126
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Just to be fun

2127
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Alright

2128
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Going to some other release dates coming up

2129
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
We have some Xbox release dates

2130
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
And some of the games that are coming out for the rest of April

2131
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
On April 28th

2132
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
New Game Room releases

2133
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
That's right, finally some new titles for Game Room

2134
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
And these will be under

2135
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Microsoft's Game Room pricing

2136
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Of either $3 for one

2137
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
$5 for both or $0.50 for one play

2138
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Super Breakout from Atari

2139
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Pitfall and Mega Mania from Activision

2140
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
I don't remember Mega Mania

2141
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Is that a game that rings a bell to you?

2142
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Mega Mania by Activision

2143
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
I know the name, I just don't remember the game

2144
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
I can't remember it either, I certainly know Pitfall

2145
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Night Stalker from Mattel

2146
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
I'm assuming that's in television

2147
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Rack Em Up by Konami

2148
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Real Sports Volleyball by Atari

2149
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
And Basketball by Atari

2150
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
So those are all some new Game Room releases

2151
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Certainly I think Pitfall and Breakout are probably the standouts there

2152
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Although I want to say Mega Mania

2153
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Ringing a bell

2154
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
But there's some other stuff on Xbox Live

2155
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
This week we had Puzzle Chronicles and After Burner Climax

2156
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
You know I meant to check out Puzzle Chronicles

2157
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Even though it looked a little weird

2158
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
But next week is Tecmo Bowl on the 28th

2159
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
So that's pretty cool

2160
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Also some Mega Man 10

2161
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Releases on the 28th

2162
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
The Endless Attack mode

2163
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
And two more special stages

2164
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Special Stage 2 and Special Stage 3

2165
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
And then BioShock 2 gets the Rapture Metro pack

2166
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
On April 29th

2167
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
As well as a Black Market Aerial pack

2168
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
For Just Cause 2 on April 29th

2169
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Being added to Games On Demand

2170
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
On April 27th

2171
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Shrek the 3rd, Far Cry 2, and

2172
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Kane & Lynch Dead Men

2173
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
And I don't know if Loki's interested

2174
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
But if he wants to pimp out his avatar with Saints Row 2 items

2175
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
He can do that on April 28th

2176
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
I'm surprised that they're even doing that

2177
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Seeing as the game came out what, two years ago?

2178
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
I mean seriously?

2179
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Isn't it a little late?

2180
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Is it a missed opportunity much?

2181
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Alright

2182
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Farmville News

2183
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
I can't believe I'm reporting on this

2184
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
What does this show come to?

2185
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
But I think it's important to say

2186
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
No I'm not going to tell you how to make money

2187
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Harvesting pineapples or whatever

2188
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
But I think it goes without saying that Farmville

2189
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Is expanding beyond Facebook

2190
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
And this would be because of a website

2191
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
I guess that spies on domain names

2192
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
That people are registering

2193
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
And Zanga, the company behind Farmville

2194
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Has registered FarmvilleAndroid.com

2195
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
FarmvilleiPad.com

2196
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
FarmvilleiPhone.com

2197
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
And FarmvilleSMS.com

2198
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
And those are all

2199
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Domain names that are registered

2200
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
By the Farmville folks

2201
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
There you go

2202
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
By the way I guess they're all also forwarding to

2203
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Farmville.com

2204
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
So there you go

2205
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
So needless to say

2206
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Farmville is slowly taking over the world

2207
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Run while you still can

2208
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
If you're worried about Fishville or any of that yet

2209
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Also worthy of mention

2210
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
There's a rare NES game called

2211
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Euphoria

2212
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Not like EU but U-F-O-U-R-I-A

2213
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Euphoria

2214
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
It's been rated by the OFLC

2215
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Which is the Australian Ratings Board

2216
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
This means that a virtual console release

2217
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Is likely possible

2218
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
What's interesting about this game

2219
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
It's pretty rare but it was actually done by Sunsoft

2220
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
You might remember Sunsoft recently

2221
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Is kind of having a re-arising

2222
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
They put out Blaster Master on Virtual Console

2223
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
There was that OK

2224
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Blaster Master upgrade game

2225
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
That also hit Virtual Console

2226
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Now apparently Euphoria the Saga is

2227
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Coming out as well. It's a Metroidvania

2228
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Type of game is what they're saying

2229
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
It's a NES game

2230
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
And it stars this character

2231
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
You get separated from his friends

2232
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
And you are looking through the world for your lost companions

2233
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
I guess it's kind of like Goonies 2 in that regard

2234
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Hey actually that sounds kind of awesome

2235
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Goonies 2 is kind of Metroidvania 2

2236
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
So there you go

2237
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
The game was released in Europe just so you know

2238
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
But I don't believe it was ever released actually in the US

2239
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Hence why it's rare

2240
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
So there you go Euphoria possibly

2241
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
On Virtual Console but usually those ratings news

2242
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Means yeah yeah they're coming

2243
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
It's a cute little game

2244
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Real quickly before Jamie takes over with some news

2245
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
The chat room is again complaining that the stream

2246
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Had failed and I guess we blacked out for a little bit there

2247
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Unfortunately

2248
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
We don't know what causes it

2249
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
And Bobby Blackwolf

2250
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Wants to clarify because you guys are hearing

2251
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
That little bumper that says

2252
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
All games are switching between it's live and on demand

2253
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Then that must mean it's on our end and it's not the all games computer

2254
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
However we are not doing

2255
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Anything out of the ordinary

2256
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
There's no one else's here but us 3's

2257
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
There's no Xbox games going on or nothing

2258
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
So you can thank Jamie's lovely internet provider

2259
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Hey!

2260
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Comcast. It's Comcastic

2261
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
They were a wonderful shade of crap this morning

2262
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
You know what my Warcraft has been going down too

2263
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
In the area so you know what

2264
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Nobody's running porn

2265
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
We did a porn check

2266
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Everything's fine so we just

2267
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
We gotta keep on rolling with the show sorry guys

2268
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
By the way

2269
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
I do want to clarify that specifically

2270
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
It is tournament edition

2271
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
NBA Jam tournament edition for Playstation

2272
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
That I'm looking for

2273
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Yes there's some on Amazon

2274
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
But Dan hasn't told me I can buy it yet

2275
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Anyway

2276
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Brightband updates we have some new

2277
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Tracks coming out

2278
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
There is Busted

2279
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Thunderbirds are Go

2280
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
For 160

2281
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Microsoft points and 200

2282
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Wii points

2283
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Flyleaf again and Silverchair

2284
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Tomorrow

2285
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
I don't see anything about an actual

2286
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Pack

2287
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Just the 3 tracks

2288
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Also somebody finally beat Castlevania

2289
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
With a DDR pad

2290
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
The old school

2291
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Castlevania like the first one

2292
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
This dude named Nick Hagman

2293
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Played

2294
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
The virtual console

2295
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Original Castlevania

2296
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Using a DDR Mario

2297
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Mix controller

2298
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
And it took 62 lives

2299
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
In more than 4 hours

2300
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
But he did it

2301
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Wait a minute I'm looking at the YouTube here

2302
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Of the guy I guess who did it here

2303
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
I don't want to hear his little monologue

2304
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
I just want to see him play

2305
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
And it looks like he's

2306
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Well in some pictures he's just

2307
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Sitting kind of using his hands but now

2308
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
On this YouTube I'm looking where he's fighting Dracula

2309
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
He is actually using his feet

2310
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
To do it so

2311
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Cause I was gonna

2312
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Criticize this a little bit if he was actually just sitting

2313
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
There kind of hitting the buttons but apparently he's actually

2314
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Dancing around I wonder if this kid lost weight

2315
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Doing it although he looks pretty

2316
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Skinny to begin with so

2317
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Wow

2318
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
I slayed Pounce and

2319
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Dracula

2320
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Congratulations I guess

2321
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Yay for you

2322
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
You have more time than I do

2323
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
A winner it's you

2324
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
And then Marvel vs Capcom

2325
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Comic books actually Udon

2326
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Who's been doing a lot of the Street Fighter

2327
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
And you know basically any of the

2328
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
The Capcom related

2329
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Comic titles that have come out

2330
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Are actually already

2331
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Discussing

2332
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
The

2333
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Possibility of doing

2334
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Marvel vs Capcom

2335
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Of course they have to get the okay through Marvel as well

2336
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Marvel does their own thing

2337
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
So who knows it'd have to be

2338
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Like a joint release but

2339
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Marvel does what Marvel wants

2340
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Yeah but hey it could be cool

2341
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
It could be kind of interesting

2342
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
What would you want to see in a Marvel vs Capcom

2343
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Comic book?

2344
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Deadpool

2345
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
The Adventures of Deadpool

2346
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
And Dan

2347
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Deadpool and Dan

2348
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Disney vs Capcom

2349
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
The actual Dan is here to say something

2350
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Disney vs Capcom

2351
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Disney vs Capcom

2352
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
I want Deadpool and Dan

2353
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
How would that work?

2354
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Deadpool and Dan

2355
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Alright

2356
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
I don't even know what's happening anymore

2357
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Help me

2358
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
My husband hijacking the show again

2359
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Yeah again

2360
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Let's get into some Twitter topics

2361
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Every week we solicit your tweets

2362
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
At www.Twitter.com

2363
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Slash O-L-R is our username

2364
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
O-L-R

2365
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Show us your tweets

2366
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Where's the tweets? Here we go

2367
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
TheShadowSniper sent us some tweets saying

2368
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
I'm unable to listen live because I work late Sundays

2369
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
I do carry around my Blackberry

2370
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Is it possible to listen live through my phone?

2371
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Ooh

2372
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Unfortunately we know of an iPod app

2373
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
An iTouch app

2374
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
I guess it runs on the iPad

2375
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
That's the all games radio app

2376
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
If you just search for all games

2377
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Or allgames.com in the iTunes store

2378
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
That's a great way to listen

2379
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Unfortunately you're asking about the Blackberry

2380
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
My advice would be

2381
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Get one of those, there's got to be like a radio tuner

2382
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Type app depending if your Blackberry

2383
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Has apps

2384
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
You would actually be able to

2385
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Tune into the feed directly

2386
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
It's just a shoutcast feed

2387
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
So any feed that will do shoutcast streams

2388
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
You can listen to all games radio on

2389
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
TheShadowSniper also asks

2390
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
What game ending is your favorite

2391
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Because of its twist ending

2392
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Or its great conclusion

2393
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
This is a good topic I don't think we've

2394
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Talked about in a very long time

2395
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Favorite video game ending, DarkSakura?

2396
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Huh? Favorite video game ending

2397
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Favorite video game ending?

2398
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
It was a twist?

2399
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
It doesn't have to be, it says

2400
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
What was your favorite because of its twist

2401
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Or great conclusion?

2402
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
I don't really know

2403
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
I mean I loved all the million endings

2404
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
For Chrono Trigger

2405
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
That goes without saying

2406
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
I loved the multiple endings for Symphony of the Night

2407
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Oh no

2408
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Richter's dead

2409
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
He was controlled by Shaft

2410
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
You know

2411
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
I have to say that

2412
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
My favorite ending

2413
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Is Maria's ending from

2414
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Dracula X

2415
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Where she's walking along with her happy

2416
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Mamba music

2417
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Her animal buddies are following her along

2418
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Yeah, because that really goes with the Castlevania

2419
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Game

2420
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Loki?

2421
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
I like the ending to Final Fantasy VI

2422
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
I was kind of

2423
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Going to go along those lines too

2424
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
And say Final Fantasy IV was actually my favorite

2425
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Ending, it was like a 20 minute

2426
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Epic ending back in the day

2427
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Good stuff, that was one of my favorite endings

2428
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
As far as like a twist

2429
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Ending, I'm trying to remember games that had like a twist

2430
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
That made me go like, oh my gosh

2431
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
I don't know, for some reason

2432
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
I'm not thinking of any I've thought in my head right now

2433
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Plus, you have to remember I have Gamer ADD

2434
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
So I don't beat a lot of video games

2435
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
I play them for about an hour and then I'm like, ooh

2436
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Shiny, I'm gonna go play something else

2437
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
So

2438
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
But yeah, you know the Final Fantasy series is always

2439
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Dependable for good endings, I think those are

2440
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Definitely up there

2441
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
So, alright

2442
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Also, I always loved the endings in

2443
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Street Fighter II

2444
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
The little stories that were just so random

2445
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Always favorites of mine too

2446
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Let's see, Spazinator PSN

2447
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Says, I can't exactly say when

2448
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
But hopefully if all goes well

2449
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Down the time I anticipate some

2450
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Epic news

2451
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Well, you can't just leave it at that

2452
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Say what the epic news is

2453
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Okay, Tigerclaw gives us like a ton of

2454
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Gaming links and we don't have time to

2455
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Read them all, I'm sorry, it's kind of a lot

2456
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
We got a lot of Twitter topics tonight

2457
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
But I'll read at least a couple of these here

2458
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Yosho Inori Ono says

2459
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Ask Capcom if you want another

2460
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Dark Stalkers game

2461
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
I'm sure there's a lot of people that want to see

2462
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
A new Dark Stalkers game come out

2463
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
And this is an interview with Video Games

2464
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Daily during a Super Street Fighter IV

2465
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Preview in London

2466
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Yosho Inori Ono, who is the Super Street Fighter IV

2467
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Producer, he actually has said that

2468
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
You know what, he wants to make a sequel to

2469
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Dark Stalkers, which of course if you've never

2470
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Played it, it was awesome, it was like a fighting game

2471
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
It was like Vampires and other like

2472
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
There were sequels, there were

2473
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Punches of sequels

2474
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
There hasn't been one in years, you know what I mean

2475
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Just like Marvel vs Capcom, there hasn't been one in like

2476
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Ten years, so

2477
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Anyhow, he says that he always

2478
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Tries to talk about Dark Stalkers in interviews

2479
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
And he wants to show Capcom that there's a

2480
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Demand for a new game, he says quote

2481
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
I am desperate to make this game

2482
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
That's a pretty bold statement

2483
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
So you know, flood

2484
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Capcom with your letters, you know when you're

2485
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Gonna send your hate mail about their DRM

2486
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
You might want to just send some

2487
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Postcards to say, oh by the way, PS New Dark

2488
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Stalkers please

2489
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
But don't screw it up with DRM, don't you dare

2490
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Let's see, also I think worth mentioning here

2491
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Sony is going to be discontinuing

2492
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
The three and a half inch floppy disk in

2493
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Japan, aww

2494
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Memories, aww remember

2495
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Three and a half inch floppies, we were just

2496
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Talking about them last week

2497
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
They were still making them

2498
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Yeah, they still make them, at least in Japan

2499
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
I want a box of them, to make something out of

2500
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Can't you still get them

2501
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
In like Office Max or something?

2502
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
I can actually get them at school

2503
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Maybe Dollar Tree has it

2504
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Yeah, probably Dollar Tree

2505
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Nice, yeah well unfortunately

2506
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Sony has said that in 2011

2507
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
There will be no more

2508
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Three and a half inch floppy disks

2509
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Available, they were first

2510
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Introduced in 1981

2511
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
And really sold abroad in Japan in

2512
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
1983, they had their

2513
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Peak in the year 2000, but

2514
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
As you can probably imagine

2515
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Now that you have USB drives

2516
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
And CDs

2517
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
And other types of storage mediums

2518
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
What ever happened to zip drives?

2519
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Remember zip drives are going to be like the next big thing

2520
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
I still have like three zip disks around here somewhere

2521
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
I have a zip drive

2522
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Or I had a zip drive

2523
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Remember the zip drive?

2524
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
That's what I used to download stuff with

2525
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
I make my portable drive

2526
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
So there it is, bye bye, three and a half inch floppy

2527
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
It's like when they got rid of the Polaroids

2528
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Man, remember when that happened

2529
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Alright, let's see

2530
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
One other one, I'll give Tigerclaw one more

2531
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Story because I'm nice and he gave a lot

2532
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
He also sent us a link to a story about

2533
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Early 3D games on PS3

2534
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Featured downgraded graphics

2535
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
It's a story he linked us to

2536
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
On Kotaku

2537
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Well that's a whole other thing we should get into

2538
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
At some point tonight, did you hear about the whole

2539
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Gawker media who owns Kotaku

2540
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
One of their other little

2541
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Websites, did you hear about this whole mess about the iPhone

2542
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
That was found at the bar

2543
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
That bought it for like five thousand dollars

2544
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Or something like that and leaked all the information on it

2545
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
And now they want it back

2546
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Well they got it back

2547
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
What a mess

2548
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
In pieces, right?

2549
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
They probably put it back together

2550
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
But yeah, that was a

2551
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Sister blog to Kotaku

2552
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Yeah, I don't know

2553
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
There's more I could say on it

2554
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
I'm kind of getting to the point where I just don't care

2555
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
It happened, whatever

2556
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Oh my god, fourth generation

2557
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
iPhone, what?

2558
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
I just think the way it all went

2559
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
That is so surprising

2560
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
The way it all went down was a little bit

2561
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
I don't know the word, I think tacky

2562
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
The one that really rubbed me

2563
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
The wrong way was the story they ran on

2564
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
The guy who lost it

2565
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
You know

2566
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
How would you like that to be you?

2567
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
I think we've all had that stupid ass moment

2568
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Where we left something or forgot

2569
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
And it might have been important, like it might have been school work

2570
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Or you know, shit, I left my

2571
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Coke on the top of the car

2572
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
And then I drove off and it flew away

2573
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
But your Coke is not a prototype device

2574
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Of a highly anticipated piece of electronic

2575
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
I understand

2576
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
But dude had a bonehead moment

2577
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
And not that it makes it right

2578
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Hey guys, look what I brought with me

2579
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
I'm so drunk

2580
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Does it necessitate him being splashed

2581
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
All over this blog and all the details about his Facebook

2582
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
And all this stuff? It's tacky

2583
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
It's just tacky

2584
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Anyway

2585
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
So tacky website sister reports

2586
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
That there's

2587
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
The PS3 apparently

2588
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Might have some downgraded graphics

2589
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
I guess Wipeout HD

2590
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
It usually will run in 1080p

2591
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Which is considered, you know, it's the Uber HD

2592
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
It has to actually be scaled back to

2593
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
720p to run in

2594
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
3D

2595
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Motorstorm, it's top resolution with 720p

2596
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
It actually has to be scaled back to less than that

2597
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Which would not even be considered HD

2598
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
In order to run in HD

2599
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Okay, but

2600
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
That's not true

2601
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
No, less than that

2602
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
It's basically pulling a halo

2603
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Where, you know, they just uprise everything

2604
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
But it's not true

2605
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
HD

2606
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Wasn't Sony the same company that marched out there and said

2607
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
We have true HD

2608
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Yeah, just like all of our games are gonna be 1080p

2609
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Running at 120 frames per second

2610
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
You know

2611
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Smoke goes towards my ass

2612
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
You know

2613
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Um

2614
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
It's not surprising that they're gonna have to cut down

2615
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
The graphics a little bit

2616
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
But I don't think you're gonna really notice when everything's

2617
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Flying towards you

2618
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Um

2619
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Obviously it's gonna take more processing power to

2620
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Display, you know

2621
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Those images

2622
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
It's gonna have to refresh twice as fast

2623
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Whatever

2624
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
I'm so over 3D

2625
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Like, fuck 3D, seriously

2626
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
I'm over it

2627
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Like, now it's just like everything

2628
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Every fucking movie's in 3D

2629
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
And every game's gonna be redone in 3D

2630
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
3D this, 3D that, 3DS

2631
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Fuck 3D

2632
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Fuck it

2633
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Blue Swim

2634
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
You're gonna get a 3DS

2635
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Maybe

2636
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
We'll see

2637
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
If it hurts my eyes, I don't know

2638
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Hey, I have one, it's called a Virtual Boy

2639
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
And it gave me a migraine

2640
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
That says, any thoughts on the new DDR game

2641
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Coming out for the 360 later this year

2642
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
That features Coldplay and Jordan Sparks

2643
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
And then links us to the thing

2644
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
I thought this game was coming out last year

2645
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
I thought that was gonna be last year's DDR game

2646
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
What happened? It got delayed?

2647
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
A year?

2648
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
It's not a new DDR game, it's still that last one that hasn't come out yet

2649
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
The one that was at last E3

2650
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
It was just

2651
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
They're like, we're just gonna call it Dance Dance Revolution

2652
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Cause that's not confusing at all

2653
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Blue Swim

2654
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
It's really hard to say

2655
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Until we see the game in motion

2656
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
I mean, I can look at the song list

2657
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
And go, meh, whatever

2658
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
But I really wanna see if they finally took the advice

2659
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Of, you know, just rebuild the game from the ground up

2660
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
It sounds like they might have

2661
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Because it is supposed to have all these new modes and stuff

2662
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
But I'm not gonna hold my breath, let me put it that way

2663
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
I'm kinda over DDR

2664
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
So it's gonna take a lot to bring me back

2665
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
I know that's a sad thing for me to say

2666
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
But I guess

2667
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Even a new BeatMania 2DX game was announced this week

2668
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
And I was just kinda like, meh

2669
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Whoopee

2670
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Whoopee

2671
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Let's see

2672
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Dark Tetsuya sends us a tweet that says

2673
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
I found this on the La Mulana WiiWare blog

2674
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
It's an interesting article about religion in video games

2675
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Hmm

2676
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Alright, let's see what this is all about

2677
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
I'm going into the

2678
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Blog here

2679
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
I have to read this whole thing?

2680
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Come on, I'm not gonna read this whole thing on air

2681
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Okay, I guess I can read some of it

2682
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Again, this is the La Mulana blog

2683
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
It has to do with religion in video games

2684
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
One of the difficult things when Japanese make games

2685
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
For foreign countries is the problems with faith

2686
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
From the historical background of Japan

2687
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
The interest in faith has been weak

2688
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
It's difficult to understand the feeling of things

2689
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Such as making vows with a hand over the Bible

2690
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
During the presidential inauguration

2691
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Or how Islamic faith views the absolute moral

2692
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
This may be obvious when you look at how

2693
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Japanese games borrow names from monsters

2694
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
And items from various beliefs, civilizations, and myths

2695
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Still more

2696
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
La Mulana is further created with an

2697
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Absurd theme that its roots are from

2698
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
All ancient civilizations around the world

2699
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Da da da

2700
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
I'd like to briefly explain the view of faith in Japan

2701
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Japan is a civilization separated from the continent

2702
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
And because the land is small

2703
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
There are few open fields

2704
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Japan's people have prospered by officially obtaining food

2705
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
As farmers

2706
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
There are many earthquakes and because of few resources

2707
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
There are only a few ruins created from large stones

2708
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
I believe that the sense of not wasting

2709
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Came from utilizing the limited resources

2710
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
In the faith born from within the continents

2711
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Culture exists a god

2712
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
Even though there is a difference between monotheism

2713
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
And polytheism, thinking about the many existing

2714
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Fears, living beyond a vast

2715
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Continent and harness of nature could have brought

2716
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Forth the absolute existence

2717
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Da da da goes on to talk about the

2718
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Do not waste philosophy and so on

2719
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Meaning there is no harm

2720
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Meant when Japanese games add elements

2721
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
From the beliefs of foreign countries

2722
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
And it can't just end there, so what's okay and what's bad

2723
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Needs to be thought out because there's no such rule

2724
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Existing, what's the best is to have the

2725
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
World's religionist check but that would not

2726
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Be possible

2727
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
So it's just kind of interesting to read this blog

2728
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Kind of talking about you know these guys

2729
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Having to consider this and all the development of

2730
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
La Mulana when you know

2731
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
It's maybe not such a big deal in some parts of the world

2732
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
But they've got to be careful not to offend

2733
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Because everything's got to be politically correct

2734
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
So

2735
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000

Problem of faith and I'll link it to you

Dig Nation

2754
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
I know

2755
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Rob's going to have a diva stomp

2756
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
We're just going to have to try harder

2757
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
But he says keep up the good work

2758
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
No and all joking you know whatever

2759
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
I can say I've never listened to an episode of that show

2760
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
So I don't know maybe they're awesome and I just don't know

2761
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
It's well Kevin

2762
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Yeah I know who's on it but does that make me care anymore?

2763
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
No

2764
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Well because it's a translate thing

2765
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
It's like a Google translate

2766
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Okay I hope that's all it is just because

2767
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
It's just kerned badly

2768
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Well the Japanese it's developed by Japanese

2769
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Obviously so you know it's just

2770
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Probably run through the Google translate

2771
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Yeah and then

2772
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Spazinator sends a last tweet

2773
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Saying sorry I'm nixing the epic news

2774
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Oh well how do you

2775
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
I know something you don't know never mind

2776
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Whatever

2777
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Let's move on with some more gaming news

2778
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Then we're going to get to our Skype line a little later in the show

2779
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
1877 game OLR

2780
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Not yet we've got some more gaming news

2781
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Mailbag and all that fun stuff

2782
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Logie why don't you get us back to gaming news

2783
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Ah yes well

2784
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
One of the things that was announced

2785
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
I want to say Tokyo Game Show

2786
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Wow Mac was that

2787
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
For Dead Rising 2 they're going to be

2788
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Doing some sort of

2789
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Different things

2790
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Other than the last game of course

2791
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
One of them being co-op in the game

2792
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
And in fact they are

2793
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Going to allow you to play through the entire

2794
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Single player campaign with

2795
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Another person

2796
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Which is awesome

2797
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
And really the way they should have done it in the first place

2798
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Um

2799
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
And then also

2800
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Let's see here

2801
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Oh great and then that disappeared

2802
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
For some reason go Comcast

2803
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Um

2804
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Now the other player that you play

2805
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
As I'm not sure if it's um

2806
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
I guess it's a clone of your own character

2807
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
I mean they're both Chuck Green

2808
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Not some other character

2809
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
That you play as but um

2810
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
It's going to be pretty awesome and they're

2811
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Going to have some different mini games you can play as well

2812
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Um

2813
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
I want to say there's like card playing

2814
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
And

2815
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Different events and stuff that you can do

2816
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
But hey

2817
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
That's pretty sweet that they're going to have something other than

2818
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Just like that Deathmatch

2819
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
American gladiator-esque

2820
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Mode in the game

2821
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Yeah I got to admit co-op sounds kind of rad

2822
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
So I'm looking forward to that

2823
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Yeah so um

2824
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
One of the other things I saw too

2825
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Um

2826
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Was that they were talking a little bit about

2827
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
The

2828
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Demo slash prequel game

2829
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
That they're going to be putting out

2830
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Um the

2831
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
I want to say what was it called

2832
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
I can't remember

2833
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Anyways um

2834
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
That should be coming out

2835
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Pretty soon I would think because I think

2836
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Dead Rising 2 if I remember correctly

2837
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Is scheduled for August right now

2838
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Well

2839
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Right now but you know we just heard

2840
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
About a bunch of other games getting pushed back

2841
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
So maybe these games will get pushed back too

2842
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Yeah

2843
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Maybe but Capcom usually doesn't move stuff around too much

2844
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
We'll see what happens

2845
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
God I just can't wait to play the game though

2846
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Yeah the more and more

2847
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
I'm hearing about it the more it sounds kind of awesome

2848
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Even if Frank West isn't in it after all

2849
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Well

2850
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
It would be funny if he made a cameo

2851
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
I mean you never know

2852
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
They're saying that he's not in it now

2853
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
But I mean

2854
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
You know

2855
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Might be funny if he has some big role in it

2856
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Or something later on

2857
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Well a new trailer also was released

2858
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Out of the Capcom press event that was pretty much

2859
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Already spoiled on last week's show

2860
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
One of the things that came out was a trailer

2861
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
For Bionic Commando Re-Arm 2

2862
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Oh awesome

2863
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
And there's that little

2864
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
That's right

2865
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
It's redesigned and it's rebuilt

2866
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:05,000
And I guess the big thing now is that

2867
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
He can actually like jump

2868
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Now

2869
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Well that takes up the point

2870
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Yeah so now he can jump and use the arm

2871
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
So there it is

2872
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
That's the big change in Bionic Commando

2873
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Re-Arm 2

2874
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
It will be on Playstation Network and Xbox Live

2875
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
The first quarter of 2011

2876
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
New weapons, attacks and all that

2877
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Fun stuff

2878
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
It's being developed by Fat Shark

2879
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
Because you know Grin did the first one right

2880
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
And they're not there anymore

2881
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
New physics based puzzles

2882
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
There will actually be a two player co-op in this game as well

2883
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
New graphics, new score

2884
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
But it will be inspired by NES

2885
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Which kind of brings me back to

2886
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
What makes this game very interesting in the first place

2887
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Bionic Commando Re-Armed was an upgrade

2888
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Of an actual NES game that existed

2889
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Called Bionic Commando

2890
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
So this is a sequel to a

2891
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Retro remake

2892
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
That isn't based off anything

2893
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Isn't that weird?

2894
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
I don't know if it's not based off anything

2895
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Some of the stuff reminded me of the arcade game

2896
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Of Bionic Commando

2897
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Wasn't there a rumored sequel in development too

2898
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
That just didn't end up happening

2899
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
I want to say I'd read a while ago that there was a rumored

2900
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Sequel in development so maybe some of this is bits and pieces

2901
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
But still the point remains

2902
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
You have a sequel to a retro game

2903
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
That doesn't actually exist

2904
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Which I find very interesting

2905
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
In a way

2906
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
But it's still got that same art style and everything

2907
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
And despite the jumping

2908
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Kind of being

2909
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Huh? For Bionic Commando

2910
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
I guess it could be cool

2911
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
And remember how I was saying too

2912
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
About the release date

2913
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
For Dead Rising 2

2914
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
They're also showing as August 31st

2915
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
On

2916
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
I guess this is news coming from

2917
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
X10

2918
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Hmm

2919
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Just in time for the end of

2920
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Summer and Labor Day. Good stuff

2921
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Alright

2922
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Anyway that's Bionic Commando re-armed too

2923
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
And look for more news on that

2924
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
As we get closer to the first half of 2011

2925
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Dark Soccer

2926
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Well

2927
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
This is some good news and actually the screen

2928
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Capture is in French

2929
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
But there is a

2930
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Screen capture that was submitted

2931
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
That shows a particular game

2932
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
For Xbox Live Arcade

2933
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
And that would be Jet Set Radio

2934
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Um

2935
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
It could be

2936
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
It could not be. It could have just been a

2937
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
Place holder by someone wanting to

2938
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
You know cause

2939
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Sonic 4 Episode 1 is on the list

2940
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
And you know

2941
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
But other stuff like Quake Arena arcades

2942
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
You know Clash. That's real. Yeah

2943
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
So it's real? Yeah it's real. It's off of

2944
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
That's the

2945
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Partner net stuff

2946
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Some of which has already been leaking online

2947
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
And they're cracking down on it pretty big

2948
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Yeah I was like it's in French

2949
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
No it's the same guys

2950
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
That released information

2951
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Well I'm not sure if it's the same person but

2952
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Those same games were on

2953
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Had screenshots leaked out because someone has a

2954
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Dev kit that they bought

2955
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
And they're releasing a bunch of screenshots

2956
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
And stuff from games that haven't been

2957
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
Announced yet or aren't released yet

2958
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
And stuff like that and then

2959
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
A few of them they actually leaked out the full

2960
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Games out there

2961
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
So

2962
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Yeah but

2963
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
People keep going ok

2964
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Release

2965
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Sonic 4 come on come on

2966
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
You know you want it and they're like no because

2967
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
They're cracking down on it and now they're password protecting

2968
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
A bunch of this stuff and

2969
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
They don't like that too much

2970
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Well I mean I can imagine

2971
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
But well yeah it's not meant for that kind of stuff

2972
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Um

2973
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Dev kits getting

2974
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Sold to

2975
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Random people

2976
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Aren't those things expensive aren't they like ten thousand dollars

2977
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
To get one of those kits? No

2978
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
No cheaper than that? A lot less than that

2979
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Really? Yeah

2980
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
How much would it cost for me to get one?

2981
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
A dev kit? About a thousand bucks

2982
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
I want a dev kit

2983
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
A thousand bucks I'm not sure if that includes

2984
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
The ability to log into Partner net or not

2985
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Um

2986
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
I don't know what exactly that takes but

2987
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
You can find them

2988
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
But you know now that there's JTAG

2989
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
Consoles out there you don't really need dev kits anymore

2990
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Yeah but a JTAG console

2991
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Can't get on Partner net and get all the details

2992
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
About games that are coming out you know what I mean? That's true

2993
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
But there's other people that can do that for you

2994
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Alright

2995
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Um

2996
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Let's move on with some more news

2997
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Loki

2998
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Ah yes um

2999
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Now there's some other interesting

3000
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Stuff um coming out from

3001
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
The Captivate stuff

3002
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Including you know these are some

3003
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Games that I believe were already out in

3004
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
Japan that are making their way out over here

3005
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Um Okameden

3006
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Is coming out on the DS

3007
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Later this year or actually I'm sorry

3008
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Uh 2011

3009
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
And of course that's the sequel to Okami

3010
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Um

3011
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
And it looks pretty awesome

3012
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
And then of course um

3013
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
You mean Legend of

3014
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Okami? Legend of Okami

3015
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Alright

3016
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
And then um

3017
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
From the same I'm not sure

3018
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
If it's the creators of the

3019
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney

3020
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Series but at least the same

3021
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
Artists um they're releasing Ghost

3022
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Trick Phantom Detective

3023
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Um that's going to be a brand new series

3024
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
And that's supposed to be making its way out

3025
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Later this year

3026
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
And then oddly enough on the Wii and

3027
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
The PS3 Sengoku

3028
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Basara Samurai Heroes is making

3029
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Its way out and I believe that's supposed to be

3030
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
Later this year

3031
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Um

3032
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
And that one uh came out

3033
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Well one of the games in the

3034
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Series came out on the Playstation 2

3035
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
A couple of years back um

3036
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Which was uh

3037
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
God I just had the name

3038
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Devil uh

3039
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Devil Hunter I think

3040
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
I

3041
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
I don't remember but I thought that was the

3042
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Name of the series that came out over

3043
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Here it's basically like uh

3044
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
Dynasty Warriors

3045
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Both guns

3046
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Cool guns

3047
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Yeah not really though I hate guns

3048
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
They've had um

3049
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
At least one other Sengoku Basara game

3050
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
That was um

3051
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
Basara I guess game that was on

3052
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
The Wii

3053
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
A while back I want to say it was the first

3054
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:23,000
Second year the Wii was out

3055
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
But they're okay they're kind of cool

3056
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
I don't know

3057
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
I just wish they was on the 360 too

3058
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
I just don't understand why they hate

3059
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Unless it's going to be coming out

3060
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
At a time when they do have the motion controller

3061
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
In play and it's

3062
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Going to be something with that and then maybe I can

3063
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Understand why it's on the Wii and the PS3

3064
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Other than that it's just hating

3065
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
They're just hateful

3066
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Why they hate?

3067
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
Don't hate the play I hate the game

3068
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Anyhow

3069
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
This is a game that I

3070
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Tried to like but it kind of

3071
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Drove me bonkers but we had a little tidbit

3072
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
On it last week it's the Lord of Ultima

3073
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
And it was actually released this week

3074
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Yay it was launched and you can actually

3075
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Play it and have fun with it

3076
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
You have to visit the website which was

3077
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
I think it was like lordofultima.com

3078
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
You can actually go and play the game

3079
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
I tried to play it and it crashed on me

3080
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
During the tutorial

3081
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
So uh yeah

3082
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
But apparently in this game you will

3083
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Set up your own little kingdom and there's little micro

3084
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Transactions and stuff I don't know it sounds

3085
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
A little Farmville to me but with Ultima

3086
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
And you know better

3087
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Graphics and all that stuff but I tried to

3088
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
Play it I wanted to review it for you guys but it crashed

3089
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
During the tutorial so I guess I'll have to try again this week

3090
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
Is any of our listeners playing? Chatters does anyone

3091
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
Try Lord of Ultima that came out this week?

3092
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Anybody?

3093
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Maybe we can have a guild?

3094
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Or a kingdom or

3095
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Something?

3096
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
I don't know. Alright let's get to the part of the show

3097
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
Where you guys get to write us and have your say

3098
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
It's our mailbag segment

3099
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Mailbag

3100
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
At orangelandradio.com is the place to send

3101
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Those emails. DarkSakura

3102
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Who's emailing us this week?

3103
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Two people

3104
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
We're drowning in letters

3105
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Redertainment

3106
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
Dear OLR I sent you

3107
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
A Twitter topic last week asking why

3108
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Activision had not set up their own bank

3109
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
I was not joking about that

3110
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
I was in fact serious

3111
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
What got me thinking was

3112
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
About this was Walmart's effort to create their own bank

3113
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
They wanted to lower the prices

3114
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Of check and credit card processing by

3115
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Cutting out the middle man in this process

3116
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Walmart wanted to establish this bank

3117
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
In the mediocre state of Utah

3118
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Which is how I came to learn about it

3119
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Ultimately the banking lobbies in Utah put the kibosh

3120
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
On this deal and the effort

3121
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Ultimately died

3122
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Activists establishing their own bank assembly lowered

3123
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Processing fees for people playing wow

3124
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
And also act as an additional

3125
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Revenue stream for Activision as if they

3126
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
Need another

3127
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
I'm not saying this would be good for the consumer

3128
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
The bank of Activision would inevitably

3129
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Church bank customers out the ass for bank fees

3130
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Jack up interest rates on loans and quickly foreclose

3131
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
On the homes of people who were delinquent on payments

3132
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
These deplorable practices

3133
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Would happen because Activision seems only interested

3134
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
In squeezing all the cash they can

3135
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
Out of consumers and not serving their customers

3136
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Well like most major banks do today

3137
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
I'm not going to say anything

3138
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
I work in the mortgage industry

3139
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
So is there a legal reason why Activision

3140
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Has not established their own bank

3141
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Or is this whole rant evidence

3142
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Of my low opinion of the banking industry

3143
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
In America and of Activision

3144
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
Stay care of entertainment

3145
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
This message is brought to you by the Burns Cafe

3146
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
In Taylorsville, Utah where thanks to their choice

3147
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
And the meat they serve you can literally bite an ass

3148
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Well it's a bummer you couldn't fit that

3149
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
In 140 characters or less

3150
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Or the tweet might have made more sense at the time

3151
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
Ok I get your joke now lol

3152
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
I don't know, Activision is not going to set up a bank

3153
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
Like they care

3154
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
I get the point you're trying to make

3155
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
But come on

3156
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
It's cute though

3157
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Your email was cute

3158
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Your thought is cute I like that

3159
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Oh this is one we've been included on

3160
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
How nice

3161
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
From Brandon

3162
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Dear C4 and OLR crew

3163
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
I got DDR U3

3164
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
With a soft pad

3165
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
And I want some modding help

3166
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
To make it a hard pad

3167
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
I want to know why you hate or have not played

3168
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
Beat and Groovy

3169
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
That's up to you Rob

3170
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
In my mind it was Pop'n Music for the 360

3171
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
As far as superior

3172
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
God please spell

3173
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Than Pop'n on the Wii

3174
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
I have a suggestion for Konami

3175
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
If they are going to do Pop'n Music Wii V2

3176
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
They should take the normal Pop'n controller

3177
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
And have a slot in it for the Wii remote

3178
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Oh God please

3179
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
This is just awful

3180
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
I'm looking for some fun RPGs for the 360 help

3181
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
That's literally how it said

3182
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
I am looking for fun RPGs

3183
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
For the 360 help

3184
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Was this typed on an iPhone?

3185
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
I can type better than this on an iPhone Rob

3186
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
And besides that iPhones

3187
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Auto capitalize and fix your spelling

3188
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
Whoever accepted my PA challenge

3189
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Should know

3190
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
That I only have

3191
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
SM and DDR US3

3192
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
And I am looking for an online

3193
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
Challenge on Live since the

3194
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
Hourly DS Master 26

3195
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
PS I want to find a cop

3196
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
That explains a lot

3197
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
It's with two Ps

3198
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Of Disney Mix for PS1 and Golden Eye Clone for today's

3199
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Consoles

3200
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
I have Disney Mix, I have both of them

3201
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
I have the Japanese one and the US one and you can't have it

3202
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
Oops, the FU's music

3203
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
How appropriate that the FU's music accidentally

3204
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Starts playing

3205
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
I didn't do that intentionally I swear

3206
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
God there was like five questions in that email

3207
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
What was the first question?

3208
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
I just stopped paying attention

3209
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
I was just reading the words

3210
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Can you go back and look for me?

3211
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
I closed it

3212
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
SSJ100Matt said that this email

3213
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Fails too many fucking ways

3214
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Okay

3215
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
You want to know how to mod a soft pad

3216
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Look online

3217
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
The way that I know how to do it

3218
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Duct tape it to a piece of plywood

3219
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Seriously? It works?

3220
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Oh yeah, packaging tape

3221
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
Do not do the sheet of plastic over it

3222
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Because you'll fall

3223
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
I'm sorry, not that

3224
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
You need to get a clear linoleum

3225
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Or whatever and you put that over the top

3226
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
And then you staple it through the bottom

3227
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
With a staple gun

3228
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
But yes, look online

3229
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
You can also use a power drill

3230
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
And screws

3231
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Although he'd probably screw his foot

3232
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
I think

3233
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Because he wouldn't be able to read the instructions

3234
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
DS Master's just not allowed to

3235
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Email us unless it's been

3236
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
Spell checked and grammar checked

3237
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Well, you know, Bobby's in chat and says

3238
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
You know he does this on purpose, right?

3239
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
The only way to stop it is to not even bother

3240
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
That's what I did, don't give him the attention

3241
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
That's actually what I was just about to say

3242
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
I'm going to stop reading emails from him

3243
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
Unless they're typed properly

3244
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
That's fair

3245
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
You need to have somebody proofread it

3246
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
And then we might read them

3247
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
Might!

3248
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
RPGs on the 360

3249
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Final Fantasy 13

3250
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
Is good

3251
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
I guess a lot of people like to

3252
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Even though I did not

3253
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Okay, whatever

3254
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Lost Odyssey, yes, thank you

3255
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
Blue Dragon's okay

3256
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
I love Blue Dragon

3257
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Bite my butt

3258
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
I will give Blue Dragon this

3259
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
If you liked the Super Nintendo RPGs

3260
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
It's very retro-esque

3261
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Blue Dragon should have just been on the Super Nintendo

3262
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Blue Dragon reminds me of playing a Dreamcast RPG

3263
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
End of story

3264
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
It's like playing Evolution

3265
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Oh, I remember the other one

3266
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
I was like, what the hell are you smoking?

3267
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Beat and Groovy, it's just not a good game

3268
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Beat and Groovy is unfinished

3269
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
It's an unfinished pile of poop

3270
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
That Konami put on the arcade

3271
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
That honestly Microsoft should have rejected

3272
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Like, it's a horrible

3273
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
Abortion of a game

3274
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
It's literally, I'm not saying that to be

3275
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
It is literally an abortion

3276
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
It was stopped

3277
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Halfway through it was actually finished

3278
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
And put on the marketplace

3279
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
You have like up to nine star

3280
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
Difficulties on songs that are never used

3281
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
There's no song on there that's harder than like

3282
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
A five star difficulty

3283
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
The song list is laughable

3284
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
There was no download content or anything

3285
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Released, it is a bad

3286
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Unfinished, aborted game

3287
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Beat and Groovy

3288
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
Do not buy it, I'm not even

3289
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Kidding, don't support that crap

3290
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
I'm gonna put out another pop of music

3291
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
Cause I'm guessing one, the Wii one

3292
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Did not sell very well

3293
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Two, Konami doesn't really

3294
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Get the Wii and stuff

3295
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Other than rehashing DDR

3296
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
And putting stuff out there

3297
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
And adding some waggle crap to it

3298
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
I mean, that's really the most

3299
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
Effort you get from Konami

3300
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
With some of these games

3301
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
So no, they're not gonna spend the time

3302
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
To make a peripheral for pop of music

3303
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
Because it just will never catch on over here

3304
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
I'll say this, at least the game had a couple

3305
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Okay songs, like the song list

3306
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Wasn't completely fail, but

3307
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
I'm sorry, you know, you put a

3308
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Poop in sparkly, pretty packaging

3309
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
And it's still poop

3310
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Pop of music is very niche

3311
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
In Japan, so

3312
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Why would you bring something that's

3313
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Incredibly

3314
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Niche over here

3315
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Just fucking fail at it

3316
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
I understand wanting to bring the niche thing over here

3317
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
If you do a good job with it

3318
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
That, I mean, was set up for

3319
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
Failure from the beginning

3320
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Honestly, I'm throwing this out here

3321
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Whoever is responsible for that game

3322
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Should have been fired

3323
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Like, I'm not even kidding, whoever was responsible for that

3324
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Fire them

3325
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
That was

3326
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
Unexcusable, that game

3327
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
Period

3328
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Alright

3329
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
What are you giggling at over there, Dark Sakura?

3330
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Are you even paying attention

3331
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
To the show?

3332
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
I just was distracted by something

3333
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
And I found a link to a product

3334
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Called HanderPants

3335
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
Underpants for your hands

3336
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
HanderPants?

3337
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Why on earth would you need HanderPants?

3338
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
I don't know

3339
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
I just think it's funny

3340
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
They're fingerless gloves

3341
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
With the design of underwear

3342
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
I'm gonna link it into the chatroom

3343
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
Jesus

3344
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
This is the same vein as Mantis

3345
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
And then you go up to somebody

3346
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
And you're like, look at my Mantis pants

3347
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Look at my HanderPants

3348
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
I don't care

3349
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Really, I don't

3350
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
Look at my Mantis

3351
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
Your Mantis?

3352
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
What?

3353
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
It's a real website, Mantis.com

3354
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
I know, I'm sure it is

3355
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
But see, there's people that are into that

3356
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
But like, HanderPants, that

3357
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
I don't understand

3358
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
There's some guys that wanna

3359
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
You know, the

3360
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
Sorry, Sakura

3361
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
Why are you doing this?

3362
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
I

3363
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
I am so easily distracted

3364
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
today. Oh, it's not funny

3365
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
Mantis

3366
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
SSJ100Matt says this topic sounds

3367
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Automatically better than dsmaster's email

3368
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
You know what's funny? We didn't even finish with his

3369
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
Email, we just went right on to talking about Mantis

3370
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
And I'm enjoying myself more than I was

3371
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Five minutes ago

3372
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Just

3373
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
You know what?

3374
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
I think that should be the rule from now on

3375
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
The rule

3376
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
No, I have it

3377
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
I have a new OLR rule

3378
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
Could you please get out the stone tablets

3379
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
And get out the chisel

3380
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
Cause they're gonna write a new rule

3381
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
When you send us a question

3382
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
To the mailbag

3383
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
And it is so horribly tight

3384
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
And grammar

3385
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Look, if you make a couple mistakes here and there

3386
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
I'm not the best with spelling and grammar either

3387
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
But at least if you put out an effort, we're not gonna laugh at you

3388
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
At least you're consistent

3389
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
If you just have a

3390
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
Horrible email that you didn't even bother

3391
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
To try with and you typed it like it was a

3392
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
Text message on the cell phone

3393
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
We are going to answer your question

3394
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
With Mantis.net

3395
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Is the website you need to go

3396
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
To fix your problem

3397
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
From now on

3398
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
Or possibly hand or pants

3399
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
When you send us a question that stinks

3400
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Mantis.net is where you need

3401
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
To go to find your answer

3402
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
Try the high cut ones

3403
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
Put that on the wiki

3404
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
It's an official rule

3405
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
Alright

3406
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Hey, whoever updates their wiki, add it

3407
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Let's go to the

3408
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
I like

3409
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
Game suggestion

3410
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
RPG 360

3411
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Well email her, I think you'll find the answer

3412
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
At Mantis.net

3413
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Alright

3414
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Speaking of which

3415
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
These things have flies

3416
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
Rob, they do have

3417
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Embroidered briefs

3418
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
You're telling me this like I would want to suddenly

3419
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
Go over them? I don't want you to get any

3420
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
I'm just saying that they're funny

3421
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
Let's get to the FUs

3422
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
FU to

3423
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
DS Masters email

3424
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
And now you know what

3425
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
I think the rule is just I'm just not answering any more

3426
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
From them, ever

3427
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Lowkey

3428
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
FU to bad drivers

3429
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
Two types in particular

3430
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
One, the person that

3431
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
Decides hey you know it's going to be a great idea

3432
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
To stop four car lengths before the car

3433
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
That's in front of them

3434
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Making it near impossible to go around them

3435
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Or the fact that they go really slow

3436
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
To accelerate once the light does change

3437
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
And then two

3438
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
The more dangerous type, the people that run

3439
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Stop signs and run stop lights

3440
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
They're there

3441
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
For safety and the fact that you

3442
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Just blow right through them like you don't give

3443
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
A shit, that's how people die

3444
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
So, stop it

3445
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
Cause I don't want to die

3446
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Um, I'm sorry I'm laughing too hard

3447
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Cause I'm looking at this website

3448
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
I don't really have a lot of FUs

3449
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
Of the week

3450
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Actually I had a pretty good week

3451
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
I really don't think I had a lot of bad things

3452
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Happen, I guess FU to those work

3453
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Days that start at 6 AM

3454
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Cause getting up at 5 o'clock to go to work

3455
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Kinda stinks, but at least the days go by fast

3456
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
So, even that's not really a complaint

3457
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Alright, let's get to some more

3458
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
Gaming news and then

3459
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
We'll open up the skype line at 1877

3460
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
Game OLR and who knows

3461
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
What phone calls we might get tonight

3462
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Uh, Lowkey

3463
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Yes, so you know

3464
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
The whole drama with Infinity Ward

3465
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
And Activision is just nuts

3466
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
Activision, they've hired

3467
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
A person to, I guess

3468
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Run their community forum

3469
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Or whatever, Dan

3470
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Amrich

3471
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
And I guess they have a Facebook

3472
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
Cause everybody does

3473
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
And he's basically

3474
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
Trying to give their side

3475
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
I guess of the whole bonus situation

3476
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
For Infinity Ward

3477
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
Um, he says

3478
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Vince and Jason had very

3479
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
Large bonuses, those bonuses are being

3480
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
Redistributed to everyone else

3481
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
To people who did not allegedly

3482
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
Attempt to steal company secrets

3483
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Activision

3484
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
Is not pocketing the bonus money

3485
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
It's still going to the people who

3486
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Work at Infinity Ward

3487
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
But you have to work at Infinity

3488
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
Ward to get it

3489
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
See, I don't want

3490
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
To see talented people screwed out

3491
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:17,000
Of a paycheck any more than you do

3492
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
So are they trying to be all like

3493
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
Hey, we're the good guys, we're gonna pay out those bonuses

3494
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
No, we're gonna pay them, we're gonna pay them

3495
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
Don't worry, they're getting a bigger share of the bonus

3496
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
Well, why don't you pay their bonuses in the first place

3497
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Because that was the whole problem

3498
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
You weren't paying the bonuses

3499
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
What, the game's been out for

3500
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
Almost

3501
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
Six months now?

3502
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
What's it like to get a bonus?

3503
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
Isn't it time to get the bonuses

3504
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Out there?

3505
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
I thought bonuses were just that, a bonus

3506
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
Allegedly, why didn't you even put the allegedly

3507
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
Attempt to steal company secrets

3508
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
They're the ones that made the game

3509
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
I think all their secrets are in their head

3510
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
They don't need to steal anything

3511
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
He's just a douche

3512
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
You know, unfortunately

3513
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
He's sub douche, you know, to the major douche

3514
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Which

3515
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Why even bother having a community?

3516
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
I think this is the same guy I want to say

3517
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
Like, why do you hate Activision

3518
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Or whatever, we want your honest answers

3519
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Or something like that

3520
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
It's like, really, you don't know why we don't like you

3521
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
I mean, really, you have to ask

3522
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
That's like my wife

3523
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
You know, if like, she's mad at me

3524
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
And I'm like, what are you mad at me for?

3525
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
And she's like, really, you don't know

3526
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
That just makes me even more pissed off

3527
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
It's because we expect our spouses to be

3528
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
Psychic when we're psychotic

3529
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:37,000
I'm letting the secret out of the bag

3530
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:40,000
Ooh, you're gonna get nasty emails from the women of America?

3531
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
I'm a chick!

3532
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
The women of America don't listen to our show

3533
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
I can get away with saying this

3534
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
Because it's exactly what I pull with my husband

3535
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Wait, Dan, you didn't hear that?

3536
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Uh, yeah

3537
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
It says, uh, although it's unclear

3538
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
Whether the Romanian Infinity War

3539
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
Employees have received their personal bonuses

3540
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
For Modern Warfare 2 yet

3541
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
Activision lawsuit claims that

3542
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
Zampanelli and Wes

3543
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
Allocated to, or, and Wes

3544
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
Allocated to themselves approximately

3545
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
One third of the total bonus pool

3546
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
For the Call of Duty franchise bonuses

3547
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
Which included

3548
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
The first Modern Warfare game

3549
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
Further, it contends that Wes and

3550
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
Zampella, um

3551
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
Were demanding an even larger

3552
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Share of the bonus pool for Modern Warfare 2

3553
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
Oh, so now

3554
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
We're seeing that they're getting too big bonus

3555
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
Or too much of a bonus or whatever

3556
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
If they wanted too much of a bonus

3557
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
Well, that's too bad that they got fired

3558
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
So that really doesn't make any sense

3559
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
Uh, and

3560
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
No word on when this whole thing

3561
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Is gonna be taken care of, but

3562
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
They're thinking that more people are gonna leave

3563
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
So, uh

3564
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
Oh, and they have a big ol' quote for

3565
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
Activision's countersuit, which I don't really feel like

3566
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
Reading, cause it's just a bunch of

3567
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
Crap

3568
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
In my opinion

3569
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
Ipsofacto

3570
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Sue

3571
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
Money

3572
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Let's move on then, shall we?

3573
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
One more story for you guys, then I guess we'll open up

3574
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
The skyfly and see what happens

3575
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Could be a fun time tonight

3576
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
877 Game OLR

3577
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Oh, I forgot to mention real quick

3578
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
This kind of goes along with this story, but

3579
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
It is apparently rumored

3580
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Or, I don't know if it's confirmed or rumored

3581
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
But, uh, they're saying that

3582
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
Modern Warfare 2 games are gonna be out

3583
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Uh, by 2011

3584
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
Or, 3, not Modern Warfare

3585
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Uh, 3 Call of Duty

3586
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
Games will be out

3587
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
Good luck, guys

3588
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
Good luck. Well, these other games

3589
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
Might be out soon. It's more website

3590
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
Leaks. Remember earlier in the show we had a

3591
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
News about Farmville and some apparent

3592
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Websites that were being registered that gave away Farmville

3593
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
On other platforms. Well, something similar is kinda

3594
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
Happening, but it has to do with some different games

3595
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
Like games that people actually play

3596
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
Here's the interesting thing

3597
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
The URLs were registered for

3598
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Bloodstonegame.com

3599
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Was registered Wednesday, and of course

3600
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
Bloodstone is supposed to be the next Bond game

3601
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
That's like the rumors that's coming out

3602
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
But you know what also was registered?

3603
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
Goldeneyegame.com

3604
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Hmm

3605
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
Could this be, I don't know

3606
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Something where, you know, there was rumors before

3607
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
There might be a Wii version of GoldenEye coming out

3608
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
Or something. Who knows?

3609
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
Uh, which is strange because I could've sworn

3610
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
I said before, it's not fucking happening

3611
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
Shut up

3612
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
But you know, where there's a will, there's a way

3613
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
Also, apparently a game that was discovered

3614
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
DriverSanFranciscogame.com

3615
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
Was registered by

3616
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Ubisoft

3617
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
Uh, it's by Ubisoft

3618
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
Yeah, I don't know

3619
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
Well, but didn't Atari

3620
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Sell it off tonight? Yeah, that's right

3621
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
So, there you go. That's too bad

3622
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.com

3623
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
And LaserHomeBattleground.com

3624
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
What the hell is that? LaserHomeBattleground?

3625
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
Sounds like laser tag

3626
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
Where's LaserCatsBattleground.com?

3627
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
That's the game

3628
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
I would've given that top of the news

3629
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Reporting. Oh, that's easy

3630
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
You just put a cat stuffed animal

3631
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
On top of the laser gun

3632
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Alright

3633
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
Supposedly, Assassin's Creed is gonna have another

3634
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Sequel in 2011 anyway, so maybe that's the

3635
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
Subtitle of the game, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood

3636
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
Who knows?

3637
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
Brotherhood? Yeah

3638
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.com

3639
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
Was just registered. Uh, sounds like

3640
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
Um, another

3641
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
PSP game

3642
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
That could be too, who knows? I'm going to the website right now

3643
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
And a time's out. I guess you have to look up the registry

3644
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
Info. There's no forwarding

3645
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
Happening just yet

3646
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
Alright guys, this is part of the show

3647
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
Where we're gonna open up the Skype line and take your

3648
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
Calls, 1-877-GAME-OLR

3649
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
Or our username on Skype is

3650
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
OrangeLoungeRadio. If you're gonna call us on Skype

3651
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
That's great, the quality's really good on Skype

3652
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
But we do encourage you to call

3653
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
Echo123 on Skype

3654
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
Or I think in the newer versions of Skype

3655
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
You click a button that says test call

3656
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
Or something, and you can test your configuration

3657
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
First, I really urge you to

3658
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
Do that, or I'm going to make fun of you

3659
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
When your call stinks

3660
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
OrangeLoungeRadio is the place to call on

3661
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
Skype. Whatever you want to talk about

3662
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
Tonight's show, go ahead

3663
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
Say your piece, have a voice

3664
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
While we wait for calls

3665
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
Cause it takes about a minute for me to say something

3666
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
And the listeners actually hear it with the encoding and everything

3667
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us?

3668
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
Yes, apparently

3669
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
There is a new game coming out

3670
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
From Bayer

3671
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
I guess, it's called

3672
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
Knock Em Down's World's Fair

3673
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
And apparently it's a device

3674
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
That, or it comes with a device

3675
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
That you use to check your blood glucose

3676
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
Level, and you can play the game that way

3677
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
That's funny, that's one of the other Tiger Claw

3678
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
Stories from the Twitter, but I just

3679
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
He sent so many, I had to pick and choose

3680
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
One of you brought it up too

3681
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
I thought I remembered hearing that this game was in development before

3682
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
Like I wanted to say some time ago

3683
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
I heard that there was a DS game in development

3684
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
That was using like medical stuff

3685
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Yeah, I can't imagine though that this would be too

3686
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
Popular, I mean it seems like a very

3687
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
Narrow market that they'd be, you know

3688
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
Well, yes, you're right

3689
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
But, I mean for that market

3690
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
I think it could actually be really cool

3691
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
Cause you know there's a lot of tweens and teenagers

3692
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
That get diagnosed with diabetes at a very

3693
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
Young age, and this could be an interesting

3694
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Way to teach them kind of the management of that

3695
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
Cause you know you have to alter your diet, take your blood

3696
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
Glucose, know what it means, you know there's a lot

3697
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
That goes with it, it's not just like, hey you have

3698
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
Diabetes, you know there's a lot of things

3699
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
That go with it, so I actually

3700
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
Think, even though yeah you're right, it's a niche thing

3701
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
It's kind of neat

3702
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
It is

3703
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
But I'm sure it will sell the particular products

3704
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
You know, it's

3705
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
Monitors and stuff for what, $200

3706
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
A pop, and then you have to buy test strips

3707
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
I mean I know your insurance usually

3708
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Covers that stuff, but you still have some choices

3709
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
On what brands you get

3710
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
It's still pretty crazy, I have

3711
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
A number of friends who have to monitor

3712
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
Yeah, especially if you're

3713
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
The type 1

3714
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
Yeah, there's different stages of it

3715
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Sometimes you can be diabetic, but you don't actually

3716
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
Have to test anything, but you still

3717
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
Well you still have to watch it, or I guess you could slip

3718
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
Into one of the other types

3719
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
Well, you typically adult onset, I believe

3720
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
That's type 2

3721
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
Yeah, my grandma had it

3722
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
So, it was unfortunate

3723
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
I don't know why

3724
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
You know what, I upgraded the version of Skype

3725
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
So I'm almost worried that the calls aren't coming through

3726
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
So I'm just gonna make sure

3727
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
Well Bobby's call came through

3728
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Yeah it's true, Bobby's call came through, so that should work

3729
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
I'm just calling the 877 number to make sure everything's okay

3730
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
Where are you people?

3731
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
I know, it's kind of weird, we're not getting any calls tonight

3732
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
Usually it's flooded with people

3733
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
I guess they're worried about the threats of sending people

3734
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
To mantis.net, I don't know

3735
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
Well I've got some more last minute stories

3736
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
Alright, let's hear it

3737
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
MacWarrior 4, there was that whole

3738
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
Kind of delay

3739
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
They were gonna release the game free

3740
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
To play over the web

3741
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
And it was being held up by

3742
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
Microsoft, now it's finally been cleared

3743
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
So there will be coming

3744
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Coming soon, there will be a brand new

3745
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
Port of MacWarrior 4

3746
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
That you'll be able to play

3747
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
For free, over the internet, through a web browser

3748
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
Isn't that exciting?

3749
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
Mad Catz is apparently now gonna be making

3750
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
All the principal peripherals

3751
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
For Rock Band

3752
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
Basically that means

3753
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
All the peripherals that come with

3754
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Say Rock Band 3

3755
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
Or any future releases

3756
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
Going forth

3757
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
Will be made by Mad Catz

3758
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
And not by EA or whoever the hell they had

3759
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
Making their peripherals

3760
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
And yeah I know Mad Catz peripherals

3761
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
At one time really suck

3762
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
But to be honest I kind of like their

3763
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
Guitar at least

3764
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
I have the bass and

3765
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
I dig that, it's pretty cool

3766
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
Does it wear out like

3767
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
The fucking

3768
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
Rock Band, just regular guitar they have

3769
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Guess what, we got a call

3770
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
Awesome

3771
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
Hi, you're on Orange Zon's radio, who's this?

3772
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
Hi, this is Amiga777

3773
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
Amiga777

3774
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
I love the Amiga, what's up?

3775
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
Just testing the streams

3776
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
To make sure that the calls

3777
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Are going through for you

3778
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
That's pretty much it

3779
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
AOK works great

3780
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
Thanks

3781
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Wait wait wait, you're not gonna

3782
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
He just hung up

3783
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
Ah yes

3784
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
Just confirm me it's not your stream

3785
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
We just don't want to talk to you

3786
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
This is just a courtesy call

3787
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
Just checking

3788
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
That's right, everything's fine guys

3789
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
No worries, you're good

3790
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
Oh that's funny

3791
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
Oh right, whatever

3792
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
Here's someone that we haven't heard from

3793
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
That's one of my favorite phone calls

3794
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
I've ever got, just so you know

3795
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Alright, here's someone we haven't heard from

3796
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
In a while, actually two years

3797
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
To be exact

3798
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
Surfer Girl is back with a new rumor

3799
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
Regarding the slim

3800
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Xbox 360

3801
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
She says it's gonna be unveiled at E3

3802
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
They're gonna rebrand the Xbox 360

3803
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
As well

3804
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Apparently

3805
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
The review will happen

3806
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
Some 360

3807
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
Natal bundle will happen at one of the

3808
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
Two Yes2

3809
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
Press conferences at this year's E3

3810
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
What's more is the 360 will be

3811
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
Getting a subtle rebrand

3812
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
With a new logo and black is the new

3813
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
Primary color for the console

3814
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
They feel that the new system needs to be black

3815
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
Because a white Natal

3816
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
Wouldn't sit well against the typical

3817
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
Gloss black TV

3818
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
The new system design is pretty neat

3819
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
And Natal, let's just say

3820
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
You're gonna be very surprised and very pleased

3821
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
By one of the games being revealed

3822
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
What is it?

3823
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
And then of course, in bold

3824
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
It says, might get shot

3825
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
Or MGS

3826
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
Perhaps a new Metal Gear Solid game

3827
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
Alright, let's go to the phones

3828
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
We have another test call coming in

3829
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

3830
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
Hey

3831
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
Hi

3832
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
Hello

3833
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
Hello

3834
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
Hey, DT, what's on your mind?

3835
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
Hi, you're here

3836
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
Turn down the speakers on the computer

3837
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
Because then you get all confused

3838
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
So what's up? What's on your mind, buddy?

3839
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
Plug in the

3840
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
I know it's a monthly

3841
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
Plug in the WonderCon

3842
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
Article

3843
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
That's right, WonderCon, you got to go to WonderCon

3844
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
A couple weeks ago and you wrote a nice little article

3845
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
About it that's on the website

3846
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
That's cool, how did you

3847
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
How did you enjoy things at WonderCon?

3848
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
Did you have a good time overall?

3849
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Oh god, yeah

3850
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
First stop was at a

3851
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
Capcom booth, they were showing

3852
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
Final Fight and Super Street Fighter 4

3853
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
And Plus Planet 2, actually

3854
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
You know, I actually read

3855
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
The article, believe it or not

3856
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
And I heard you scored a soundtrack

3857
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
At the booth, what'd you get there?

3858
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
Actually, that was just posted online

3859
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
What I got was a couple

3860
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
Yeah, no, you're right, I thought the

3861
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
Rockman 9 soundtrack

3862
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Nice

3863
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
I like how you call it Rockman 9

3864
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
And not Mega Man 9, was it actually the Japanese

3865
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
Version?

3866
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
Yeah, it was

3867
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
No, that's cool, very cool

3868
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
It's interesting, though, that you were at

3869
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
See, this kind of blows me away

3870
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
Even though I know it was a few weeks ago you went to

3871
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
WonderCon at this point, so for some people

3872
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
This does strike me as interesting

3873
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
Capcom had to know

3874
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
Marvel vs. Capcom 3 was

3875
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
Happening when they did WonderCon

3876
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
But yet, they didn't say anything

3877
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
At what you would otherwise

3878
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
Think is a really freaking

3879
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
Logical place to announce a game like

3880
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
Marvel vs. Capcom 3

3881
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
And yet, not a peep, right?

3882
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
I know

3883
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
They talked about being at future

3884
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
Comic Cons and whatnot

3885
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
With that

3886
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
I guess WonderCon just wasn't good enough, sad cry

3887
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
Upset

3888
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
But hey, there's

3889
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
BayCon coming up

3890
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
I think is a big sci-fi nerdy con

3891
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
I don't know if there will be a lot of video games of that

3892
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
But I know I had some friends talking about that

3893
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
Memorial Day weekend, and of course, Fonome

3894
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
Memorial Day weekend is always a big con weekend

3895
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
So there's a lot of that coming up

3896
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
Any cons in your future, otherwise?

3897
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
I don't know

3898
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
Probably just trying to go to

3899
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
WonderCon next year

3900
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
I know my brother was excited about that

3901
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
He's really big into comics

3902
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
That's cool, you gotta go to Comic Con

3903
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
I've heard that the one that happens in San Diego

3904
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
Is epic, I would love to go someday

3905
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
But I just don't know if I'm gonna make it

3906
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
That's weird

3907
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
It wouldn't surprise me at all, with all the stars

3908
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
And everything to go, I'll have to plan for 2011

3909
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
Or something

3910
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
Well, Darktotu, Darktotu, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?

3911
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
Well

3912
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Yeah, no, I know

3913
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
I heard some

3914
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
footage got stolen at the Super Street Fighter

3915
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
4 launch event

3916
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
I don't know if he talked about that

3917
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
We didn't, what did you hear about this?

3918
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
I vaguely remember seeing an article on this

3919
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
What's up, what's going on?

3920
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
I don't know, I guess someone stole a bunch of stuff

3921
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
But the Super Street Fighter launch event

3922
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
Like, footage of

3923
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
the different players and all of that

3924
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
And a MacBook

3925
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
So they want to know who the hell

3926
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
But the game's like, I don't get what the

3927
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
advantage would be to stealing something like that

3928
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Like, the game is pretty much out now

3929
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
They didn't steal anything regarding the game

3930
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
They stole camera equipment

3931
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
And SDI records

3932
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
And a MacBook

3933
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
It was that they wanted the computer equipment

3934
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
It wasn't anything to do with what was on it

3935
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
It was, uh, I am 8-bit

3936
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
Oh, that's stinky

3937
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
How did a thief get into an event like that?

3938
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
That's terrible

3939
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
Well, you see the people that play Street Fighter

3940
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
Oh, stop it! I play Street Fighter, you ass

3941
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
But yeah, there are some shady people that play

3942
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
Street Fighter, just saying

3943
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
But that dates back to 1992

3944
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
So, well

3945
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
There's shady people that play anything

3946
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
That's very true

3947
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
Dark Tetsuya, thieves suck and they should be laughed at

3948
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
And taunted

3949
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
And made fun of

3950
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
And that's why we're here

3951
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
Alright, well, Dark Tetsuya, thanks so much for the phone call

3952
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
We're gonna let you go to see if, you know, anyone else

3953
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
by chance, you know, we want to free up the phone line

3954
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
of those floods of calls that are coming in tonight

3955
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
Alright, you take care

3956
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
And thanks for all you do for OLR, we appreciate it

3957
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
Take care

3958
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
Yeah, no problem

3959
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
The fine Dark Tetsuya, who really tries to actually

3960
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
put content on orangeontraded.com

3961
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
Nice guy

3962
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
Tigerclaw says they don't care about the equipment

3963
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
All they care about is getting the footage

3964
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
Tigerclaw says they recorded footage of the event

3965
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
Yeah, they just want the footage back

3966
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
That's just messed up

3967
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
Thieves suck

3968
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
Alright, what else you got, Loki?

3969
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
Anything else?

3970
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
Just some last minute stuff here

3971
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
There's another little big

3972
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
Or, I guess, a little big planet

3973
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
PSP download content pack

3974
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
that's gonna be coming out called the Turbo Pack

3975
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
And it's gonna feature some

3976
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
new

3977
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
stock car racing inspired tracks

3978
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
and vehicles

3979
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
And also they're gonna have

3980
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
I guess some construction based vehicles

3981
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
as well that are gonna be available

3982
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
such as forklifts, cranes, and cement mixers

3983
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
So that's kinda neat

3984
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
Unbound Saga

3985
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
which was kind of a comic-based

3986
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
beat-em-up game that was on the

3987
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
PSP is now making its way

3988
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
to Xbox Live Arcade

3989
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
Kind of a little bit like Comic Zone, I guess

3990
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
PSP one is kinda

3991
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
alright, I guess

3992
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
But that'll be coming out a little bit later on

3993
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
this year

3994
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
Asia is getting

3995
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
a limited edition Final Fantasy

3996
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
13 controller

3997
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
with the silkscreen of lightning on it

3998
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
I guess to go with your Final Fantasy

3999
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
13 lightning

4000
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
PS3. Why that wasn't

4001
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
included with the PS3 is beyond

4002
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
me, but whatever

4003
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
I guess, you know, opportunity to sell it twice

4004
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
And then

4005
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Lastly

4006
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
just a little bit of elaboration on a story

4007
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
we had earlier talking about delays

4008
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
from Nintendo, kind of as

4009
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
I thought, different things

4010
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
It's taken a little bit longer to get the

4011
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
development for Metroid Other M done

4012
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
because they're working with a third party company

4013
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
on it

4014
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
That's why it's been delayed to August 31st

4015
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
And then of course Sin and Punishment

4016
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
Star Successor is just basically to fill the

4017
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
space

4018
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
because it was originally going to come out at the beginning of the month

4019
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
And they did their excuses

4020
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
Well we just want you to have some more time to play

4021
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
Super Mario Galaxy 2

4022
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
So, that is it

4023
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
Alright

4024
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
Well, I don't know what's up

4025
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
Something's in the water

4026
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
Come on people! Ron Sean, call us

4027
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
No, I closed Skype

4028
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
One last thing also, forgot

4029
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
This might be the next Yaris

4030
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
Apparently, Audi is releasing

4031
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
a free rhythm based driving game

4032
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
for the iPhone

4033
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
Oh goody

4034
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
No more to say there

4035
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
Well, I don't know

4036
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
I guess, you know, it's okay

4037
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
Some weeks, you know, in all things considered

4038
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
it was a bit of a slow news week

4039
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
of sorts, you know, a lot of the stories we had

4040
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
tonight weren't like huge things

4041
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
I mean a lot of stories were confirmations of things that were spoiled

4042
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
last week and you know

4043
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
It really does, but where's the love?

4044
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
Where's the love?

4045
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
I could use the extra time tonight to

4046
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
take care of some things before work tomorrow

4047
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
I'm sure we all could so

4048
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
I think we're going to wrap it up, believe it or not

4049
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
A little bit of a shorter show tonight, but that's okay

4050
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
Again, it just wasn't a huge

4051
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
huge week for news

4052
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
It was like a bunch of Capcom news

4053
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
We already knew that

4054
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
Of course, you know, it's going to be like this for a few weeks

4055
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
because E3 is on the horizon

4056
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
so outside of your E3 leaks

4057
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
May is going to be a bit of a slow month

4058
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
If I'd known

4059
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
we would have planned a game or something for tonight

4060
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
So you know what that means next week

4061
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
if it's a slow news week again, we're going to have a game

4062
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
or something

4063
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
Or we might have an actual guest on the show

4064
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
I know my friend Matt is dying to come back

4065
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
He was here back when the show was still at my house

4066
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
He's like, I really want to come back and hang with you guys

4067
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
I'm like, okay

4068
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
I'm sure Alan will be here in the next couple of weeks

4069
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
He's loving coming to the show

4070
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
So we'll have him at some point

4071
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
BlackWolfInChat says

4072
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
Okay, so let me get this straight

4073
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
Rama calls my show for the first time ever

4074
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
but doesn't call OLR

4075
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
It's a weird night

4076
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
It's okay

4077
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
No, I closed Skype, I'm sorry guys

4078
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
The moment's passed

4079
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
The opportunity has passed

4080
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
That's okay

4081
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
I won't take it personally

4082
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
He's just going to have a big diva stop

4083
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
Send us some emails

4084
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
mailbagatorangeloungeradio.com

4085
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
and all that fun stuff

4086
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
And see, I would love to

4087
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
just do a game

4088
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
pull a game out of the hat, but we don't have anything

4089
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
That's okay guys, no seriously

4090
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
I could stand to wrap up the show by 9 o'clock

4091
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
and then go home and take care of some other stuff

4092
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
So, we are out you guys

4093
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
Let's go around

4094
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
You know what you could do? What?

4095
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
You should play the clip of Julian again

4096
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
Because you know what? No phone call that we're even

4097
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
going to get could possibly match

4098
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
how disgustingly cute Julian is

4099
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
in that clip

4100
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
He's a cute kid

4101
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
I'm telling you, this is going to be all the rage

4102
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
at youtube.com slash users slash dark

4103
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
sakura OLR

4104
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
Dalek

4105
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
What does a Dalek say?

4106
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
Is that my night?

4107
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
That's the cutest, and look at that expression

4108
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
I know

4109
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
One more time

4110
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
One more time

4111
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
What does a Dalek say?

4112
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
Exterminate

4113
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
I like how he even says it a little bit robotically

4114
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
Exterminate

4115
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
I love it

4116
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
I wish I had grown up on a show like Doctor Who

4117
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
That's kind of awesome

4118
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
Did you? No, I didn't really, not me

4119
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
Keep in mind

4120
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
I was watching PBS a lot

4121
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
when I was a kid

4122
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
So Doctor Who came on PBS

4123
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
So I started with like

4124
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
fourth Doctor

4125
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
Sarah Jane era

4126
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
So she's always

4127
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
going to be my favorite because she's who I remember

4128
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
May Satsuma in chat says

4129
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
Julian is smarter than DS Master

4130
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
confirms

4131
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
Julian is smarter than most

4132
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
adults I know

4133
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
I know, I'm serious

4134
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
He's a smart kid

4135
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
And he's a bit of a smart ass too

4136
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
Just like his parents A little bit sassy?

4137
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
A lot Okay, very cool

4138
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
Alright

4139
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
I didn't have Doctor Who to

4140
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
grow up on though, you know what shows I watched growing up?

4141
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
I watched Sesame Street

4142
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
Of course, I mean god, who didn't watch Sesame Street?

4143
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
And 321 Contact

4144
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
And then later on

4145
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
as I was getting older, Square One TV

4146
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
Remember that show?

4147
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
They need a show like that again

4148
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
That's the one they used to play in a homeroom I think

4149
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
They didn't play it at school

4150
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
No, we had Channel One

4151
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
Or something

4152
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
They would pipe this

4153
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
like pay cable show

4154
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
into our homerooms every morning

4155
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
and try to edumacate us

4156
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
I just did my homework

4157
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
The only show I remember watching

4158
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
on like an early morning

4159
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
TV thing at school was Kids Court

4160
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
with Paul Provenza

4161
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
I remember Kids Court

4162
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
Remember that?

4163
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
It was like Nick TV in the classroom or something like that

4164
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
Good stuff

4165
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
Alright, reminiscing is fun

4166
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
but alas, the show must come to an end

4167
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought tonight

4168
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
Dark Sakura, why don't you start us off tonight

4169
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
Your final thought? I found Happy Tape

4170
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
My final thought is

4171
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
I see some yarn over on Dark Sakura's

4172
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
bookshelf and it makes me think

4173
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
I wish I was a cat so I could just play with that yarn

4174
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
all day Yarn, yarn, yarn

4175
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
The scarf of yours I still need to finish

4176
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
You need to see the scarf I got yesterday

4177
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
at a thrift store for a dollar

4178
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
Yes, awesome

4179
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
I was like a flaming gay fourth doctor

4180
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
I really was

4181
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
It was very short

4182
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
Because it was for a twelve year old girl

4183
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
and I bought it at a thrift store to wear to Rocky

4184
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
Anyhow, but that's neither here nor there

4185
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
Loki, your final thought tonight

4186
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
I want to play more Just Cause 2

4187
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
Hopefully this time the textures actually show up

4188
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
so that I can see what I'm doing

4189
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
because it's kind of hard when the whole map is see-through

4190
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
or most of the map is see-through

4191
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
Thank you guys so much

4192
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
for downloading our show

4193
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
listening to it live, supporting

4194
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
independent podcasting, you guys are

4195
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
awesome, I know I say that week after week

4196
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
but if you think about it

4197
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
next week, tomorrow, next week

4198
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
is episode 365

4199
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
of our show, that's one

4200
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
for every day of the year

4201
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
and that's a whole long time

4202
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
and we just wouldn't have made it this long

4203
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
if it wasn't for the support of you guys

4204
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
just being here every week and saying

4205
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
you guys are funny

4206
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
so thank you guys so much

4207
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
and all we ask if you enjoyed Orange Lawns Radio

4208
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
just tell a friend

4209
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
or two or five about Orange Lawns Radio

4210
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
and what we do here

4211
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
and just help us spread the word, that's really all we ask

4212
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
because many of you have shared your tweets and Facebook messages

4213
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
about how you've done that and trust me

4214
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
we really do appreciate it because

4215
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
we don't have money to take out advertising

4216
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
or whatever

4217
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
we have other podcasts, so hey, if you want a guest spot

4218
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
just email one of us

4219
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
I know I've gone on other shows

4220
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
and I don't think Dark Soccer would be opposed to it

4221
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
she had another show for a little while

4222
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
and I don't think Loki's going to mind

4223
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
it will be back, by the way, I did ask about it

4224
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
there's just

4225
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
graduations coming up

4226
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
and someone being very busy

4227
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
I've never asked to be on our show

4228
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
I'm not surprised

4229
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
Loki, you were on All Games Interactive

4230
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
a couple times, I think

4231
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
I had to do a toss over

4232
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
there you go, alright

4233
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
actually, and I do also want to

4234
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
say, given that

4235
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
graduation thing, by the way

4236
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
it's Mar and Marvel

4237
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
our own Tiara

4238
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
congratulations in two months

4239
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
absolutely, what's the major?

4240
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
graphic design

4241
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
good stuff, well hopefully she'll be back on the show

4242
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
hopefully she'll be taking a graduation gift trip out here

4243
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
but Loki, poor Loki

4244
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
who has not been on any show

4245
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
somebody needs to email Loki and get him on a show

4246
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
that's alright

4247
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
doesn't matter

4248
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
alright, let's see

4249
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
Amiga777 in chat says

4250
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
I nominate Tommy T to be a guest

4251
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
I'm assuming he means Tommy Tallarico

4252
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
we had him on a couple of years ago

4253
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
it was right before the Video Games Live

4254
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
CD came out, it was about two years ago

4255
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
he's fun, we'd have him back on the show

4256
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
maybe after E3 and all that

4257
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
that was a fun show, a fun concert though

4258
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
oh yeah, they're doing it again

4259
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
they're doing it again at E3 this year

4260
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
I wish they'd do it in San Francisco again, hopefully we'll see

4261
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
alright, that's it, we're done, we're wrapping up

4262
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
we're out of here, thank you guys so much

4263
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
again for your support, and what do you say we do it all again next week

4264
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
sound good?

4265
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
and no, it is not Episode Live 365

4266
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
I've got nothing going on next week, sure

4267
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
we don't speak about that

4268
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
are they even around still?

4269
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
I believe so

4270
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
but they don't look any different, they did about four years ago when we left

4271
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:47,000
alright, that's it, we're done, bye, good night

4272
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
see you next week
