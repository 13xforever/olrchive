16283	19168	Could a new TV station come to an Xbox near you?
19549	23336	Some big Wii titles get delayed and a Capcom press event confirms all.
31437	39404	Hello my friends all across the internet and welcome to another episode, episode 364 of Orange Lounge Radio.
39544	43428	It's the video game program where every gamer has a voice.
43928	57541	Pull up a chair and join us in chat, chat.orangeloungeradio.com as we tape live on this lovely Sunday evening, April the 25th of 2010, right after Bobby Blackwolf has finished his show at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
58121	59062	I heard worse over the weekend Yes I am
83467	84047	How are you doing?
84587	85288	I'm doing okay.
102429	103210	It was alright.
103290	104851	It was definitely edible this time.
105272	107354	And I just have to say, it's kind of just average.
107974	111337	Really, for the cost, you're better off getting pretty much anything else.
112158	113579	Even stuff from KFC.
113619	117823	Because, I mean, Double Down's like a good, I think, $6.99 or something.
118704	122447	I mean, hell, you can get a lot more chicken for that.
122467	123408	Just get a chicken wing.
123448	125050	Just get a chicken wing.
125650	126651	Just keep it old school.
126671	127912	Barbecue wings or something like that.
128472	129513	That's really where it's at.
129593	130353	It's good stuff.
130853	131954	Don't need the mess of the Double Down.
131994	135056	It's really just an excuse to sell expensive chicken.
135456	136437	That's all it really is.
138138	140539	But yeah, tried it with extra bacon even.
141700	142320	It's kind of okay.
142580	143781	Even extra bacon didn't make it better?
143941	146363	Didn't really make a difference, really.
146943	150665	It was just too much of the white meat chicken flavor.
151226	151466	Alright.
152246	167530	I'm going to our chat room at chat.orangelandredi.com You know we call them the always present fourth guest on the show Because we don't have any special guests tonight We haven't had a lot of special guests at Studio Dark Sakura I don't know what it is The people I invented to were outside in the front yard racing RC cars Or they were Is that what they're really doing?
168050	172231	Yes That's funny I only saw the girls across the street in the Barbie car
172811	177495	Well, that was while when you were just here and sitting here wondering what to do.
177675	177895	Yes.
178756	181218	They were outside actually chasing the dog with the RC cars.
182078	183880	Will's dog went to the pit bull.
184140	189364	And just to bring some light to what DarkSakura said while you were sitting here wondering what to do.
189804	192427	Usually I get to the show about an hour early, right?
192907	198091	I get here to the show because, you know, I want to set everything up, get the mixing board, the mics, the chairs, everything.
198271	199612	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
222924	226887	Yes, and she even gave me, what is this, like sweet beer or something, soda beer.
226927	228948	Shandy, it's a Shandy Bass.
229028	230629	DarkSakura's trying to get me drunk.
230689	231570	It's beer soda.
231850	233491	I don't know why she's trying to get me drunk.
233611	241136	It's a little too sweet overall, but it's really good because it tastes just like, it's basically like a lemon soda with a little bit of beer in it.
241856	248220	I know we usually start off the show talking about our gaming weeks, but there's some actually really funny personal things I think we have to talk about.
248320	251161	And DarkSakura, this cracked me up.
251442	254323	Something that you have recently added to YouTube.
254403	258706	Give us some background on what's going on here and what happened this past week.
259626	264888	Well, I went to my friend Becky's son's third birthday party.
265448	267749	Well, okay, first of all, first of all, that morning I went to a bar mitzvah.
268369	271250	I hadn't eaten anything, so I won't even go into that.
271290	277532	So I went to Becky's son's birthday party, and he was really cute, and he was wearing like the best shirt ever, which was a t-shirt with a dalek on it.
278352	281393	So I actually managed to get some commentary from him.
282563	284683	And I love this YouTube more than anything.
285864	286044	What?
286544	291565	The first thing... The first thing that got cut off is I asked him what was on his shirt.
292265	292485	Oh, okay.
292725	295386	So, hey kid, what is on your shirt?
297566	298566	Dalek.
299207	300347	What does a Dalek say?
300367	302987	Stimulate.
307088	311929	And my immediate reaction was, DarkSakura, what are you teaching the children?
311969	313109	I didn't teach him that.
313390	314010	It wasn't me.
314350	314950	I didn't do it.
315470	321532	It was either his mother or his aunt or some relative along that vein.
323192	328053	And if you want the chat room shouting, link, link, but I want to give this out so that everybody has it.
328133	330214	It's just on DarkSakura's personal YouTube, which you've given us.
330234	331174	DarkSakuraOLR.
331274	332074	Yeah, just YouTube.
332274	332434	What?
332494	335855	YouTube.com slash user slash DarkSakuraOLR.
336155	338677	Exterminate Exterminate Exterminate Exterminate
364466	367809	All right, we have breaking... Okay, Becky, because I'm chatting with Becky.
367829	368490	What?
368850	372273	She said that he watched Doctor Who with them and seen a Dalek episode.
372614	373174	Ah, I see.
373254	374355	So he knows what a Dalek is.
374675	378119	All right, well, we got some other breaking news live unfolding.
378439	382182	Breaking news here at the OLR Studio Headquarters.
382202	382783	Breaking News
388479	392622	We go live over to Techmaster Loki with the special report here.
393042	393683	What is going on?
393723	396065	This is unfolding live, actually, literally.
397045	400208	One minute before we went live tonight, we've found something out.
400248	401108	What is going on, Loki?
401268	413437	Apparently one of Jamie's friends messaged me on Facebook by the name of TJ McKimmy and posted a link to a Stockton Craigslist entry
414238	417480	Guess whose number happens to be right there?
417920	420522	Oh, the guy that stole my 360 a while back.
420882	422983	He's trying to offload a PS3 now.
424364	424724	And your money.
425663	426443	Yes, and my money.
427364	443112	So the guy who hacksawed your 360 for real and just ran off with it and never... And if you didn't hear the show about a month ago, long story short, you went out to meet the guy and he was going to do the JTAG thing on your 360 so you could play Espeluda and all that stuff and no more heroes and stuff, right?
443252	443412	Yep.
443673	449996	So he was going to do that to your 360 and he said, you know, come back in a couple hours, which should have been your hint right there, Loki, but you know...
450756	451457	I want to nail him.
477293	499141	I know, and the chatter's going, call him, call him live on air I am not radio professionally I think there's an issue with doing that when you don't have the person's permission I realize he's the bad guy but I worry it would turn into one of those things where the thief falls through the roof and then sues the owners of the home for the fact that he broke his foot trying to break into the house You know what I mean?
500462	503583	So, I can't do anything about it
507469	511291	As we look to the person who can do something about it.
511431	513091	I don't want to drive down to Stockton again.
513111	514151	I mean, it's Stockton.
514211	515232	It's just awful.
515412	518033	Hey, we don't write the news.
518473	519233	We just report it.
519313	521254	I say just call Stockton PD.
521794	523955	It would be funny, but what are they going to do?
524055	528596	They're going to be like, well, it's our word versus yours.
528696	530577	Yeah, I was trying to illegally hack my 360.
532577	534158	It doesn't even matter if that was the case.
534618	538298	I was having solder work done on my 360s motherboard.
540099	544760	And Bobby in chat, because he knows more about radio than I do, says it depends on the state's guy.
545260	547301	Some states only need one side's permission.
548581	550901	Again, it's just one of those things where it's like, you know what?
550921	552082	What about calling Disneyland?
552222	553942	I don't think it would be good radio.
555002	556363	Remember when they called Disneyland?
556483	557183	That was harmless.
557323	557863	That was funny.
558103	559084	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
583860	587721	I don't know what happened there.
587821	588541	That's very odd.
614793	616674	Xbox guys hacking our network too.
616734	621096	Alright, let's get around 10 minutes into the show finally and we can finally talk about our gaming week.
621156	622517	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
623518	624298	It was not.
625199	627860	Oh yeah, I started playing Babylonian Twins.
629429	632851	Now that I finally have gotten my projects out of the way and had a chance to play something, it's really fun.
632931	633772	Oh my god, it's really fun.
634832	643837	But it's definitely, it's like a puzzle adventure game, it really is, because you do one thing with one brother, and then the other one is a statue.
644878	651699	So you actually can use him when one's a statue, you can jump off of him and put him on buttons and levers and things.
652619	655420	So it's just, it's really, really fun.
656040	658141	This is the best way I can say it, it's just really fun.
659201	665322	And I've gotten through like the first, I got through the tutorial level just playing around and now I'm actually doing one of the levels for real.
665882	670223	You know, like I said, I've really been busy doing a lot of other projects, but...
673202	675188	But this is really fun.
675249	675911	It's a fun little game.
676493	678499	And once I play more, I'm actually going to do a little write-up on it.
679983	689525	Oh my gosh, our website might actually get some content outside of the... And don't get me wrong, I love that song, but that's about the only new content our website gets besides show updates.
689685	690425	So that would be great.
691145	691725	I'd love that.
692265	692485	What?
694206	695086	New content for the site.
695106	695886	It'd be great.
695926	696206	Oh yeah.
697146	699307	I mean, we have the I Love That song, but that's it.
700207	700947	You know, we get it.
701287	702007	People love music.
702027	704247	My brain was still on the game, so I was like, what?
704687	705728	Oh, that, yeah.
706508	707468	See, I had already forgotten about it.
709187	710267	Loki, how was your gaming week?
710667	715989	It was okay, just playing Grand Theft Auto at work, and that was fun.
717049	730693	And then, let's see, this weekend I played through some of Just Cause 2, just the beginning, because I have a version of the game that has some of the PC mods on it, so that was kind of fun to play around with.
731133	738277	Although, I don't think I ripped it right because a lot of the textures weren't appearing, so it was kind of hard to play.
738837	743380	But it was fun nonetheless, so I re-ripped it, and hopefully it'll work this time.
745401	748502	And then, of course, more Escaluda 2.
748883	754286	This time, I went through the Black Label Novice, and that was fun.
754826	759468	I'll probably play through the rest of the game later on, just kind of go in one version of the game at a time.
760309	760449	Um...
763199	765742	and what else did I play?
767203	769746	I don't think I played any Final Fantasy XIII.
771648	773791	So yeah, I think that's about it, unfortunately.
775254	777316	Star Trek Online Star Trek Online Star Trek Online
796984	805576	I will say this though, obviously I've been going through personal stuff with the job change, yada yada, boo hoo for me, but I mean, well actually it's a good thing, but it just takes away from the gaming schedule.
806137	811263	I will say this, on the Warcraft front I actually did accomplish quite a bit.
812625	817768	I actually got one of my new characters, my warrior that I've been leveling with Alan.
817808	820610	We got those together to Northrend, which is a big event.
820810	822891	We're in the new content, The Wrath of the Lich King.
823131	823932	But I will also say this.
824092	826913	For the first time, finally, this week, I know I'm a little late.
827214	828655	I'm not much of a raider usually.
828675	830015	I don't really run the raids a lot.
830075	832557	And wow, I used to about a year ago, but I don't really do it anymore.
832957	835058	But this week, just randomly, got asked to go.
835179	835539	I went.
836139	845788	I ran Ice Crown Citadel, the new, well, new-ish, it's not that new anymore for a WoW player, but a couple months old raid that's basically the end game right now.
845848	848791	The Lich King is the boss of Ice Crown Citadel at the very, very end.
849672	851033	I was there for a couple hours.
851173	852615	We got to the gunship battle.
852695	854056	I had to go because I had other commitments.
855037	856438	But we fought the first two bosses.
856479	856879	It was cool.
857379	860142	So I can finally say I've seen the inside of Ice Crown Citadel.
860182	860282	Woo!
861423	864484	I need to run it again though because you get reputation just for killing monsters in there.
864504	866665	You can get cool rings and stuff.
867685	868665	So that was it.
868705	871886	I had a pretty Warcraft wonderful week.
872567	874787	I will try to get back into some of the consoles this week.
874927	877168	I know there's some stuff for Game Room coming out.
877228	879569	We'll get to later in the show that I definitely want to get around to.
880009	883870	Although something that somehow missed the show roll so I'll bring it up now.
884251	886751	I heard there were layoffs at Chrome this week.
886811	888392	Apparently the Chrome studio in Australia...
888872	892396	had some big layoffs and didn't they make Game Room?
892816	893017	Yeah.
893397	895339	So are we screwed?
895739	896240	Probably not.
897625	899586	I mean, they have the emulation already set.
899646	902267	It's just putting a ROM with an emulator in place.
902447	904288	Probably not even that, just putting a ROM in place.
904648	906128	Well, they do other games too, though, right?
906228	907249	Yeah, they do other stuff.
907289	918172	So maybe this just impacts the other stuff, because I was reading it had nothing to do with Game Room, even though Game Room kind of met with a reception, but that it was more the fact they didn't get the rights to some Wii game they were going to do.
920553	921934	And I don't remember now.
922534	925095	Somebody in chat will correct me, but there was some game they were supposed to do
925475	925755	DarkSakura.com
943550	944471	Housekeeping Tonight.
945031	946112	Not a lot of show notes.
946332	949314	I believe we're still here every week for the foreseeable future.
949654	952056	Although I will say our anniversary show is creeping up on us.
952476	956559	And our anniversary show is going to be the 27th, I think, of June.
956880	958421	I don't know.
958441	964005	It'll be the 27th or the 20th of June will be our, what, eight-year anniversary show?
964645	964985	Jeez.
965325	965845	I know, right?
966665	968206	So that's in about eight weeks.
968686	970346	And Memorial Day is coming up.
970386	972106	I think we're still all here for Memorial Day.
972606	972926	I don't think.
972966	974487	Is anyone going out of town for Memorial Day?
975207	975407	No.
975647	977067	And we still have a show on Memorial Day.
977727	977987	All right.
979248	980448	No Fonamay this year again.
980748	981708	I might be going, actually.
981788	982308	Are you going to go?
982908	983328	I don't know.
983388	983828	It depends.
983968	985409	I'd like to go and just kind of drop in.
985429	988329	But we keep forgetting to like, oh, yeah, we should like try to get a panel.
989109	990890	But that's got to be set in stone by now.
990970	992150	So we missed out on that one.
992530	993010	Yeah.
994011	995132	Maybe go just to say hey.
995872	996192	We'll see.
996593	996873	All right.
997994	1000415	Not that many people come and see us at panels anyways.
1001116	1001776	I've had fun.
1001796	1002977	It's always fun.
1003057	1003377	It was fun.
1003437	1004018	I don't know.
1004138	1008781	More people came out of Fonamade than some of the other places I've gone to do panels.
1009161	1013584	Well, sometimes when you have panels at 7 in the morning, it's not difficult to get a crowd.
1013644	1014545	Hey, that was fun.
1015025	1016906	That one kid who showed up had a good time.
1016926	1019708	I was like, what the hell are we doing here?
1019928	1020469	Seriously.
1022070	1022430	All right.
1022790	1023811	Why'd I wake up early for this?
1024791	1026813	Did you say that I've done a little bit of cleaning in here?
1026953	1027353	A little bit?
1027513	1028014	A little bit.
1029094	1032257	So I've started the... Your bookshelf looks a lot nicer than it used to.
1032397	1033518	Massive... It really does.
1033598	1035819	I've been starting the massive task of organizing this room.
1035839	1036280	Mm-hmm.
1036700	1036820	Ugh.
1037721	1037981	All right.
1038021	1039342	I'm putting pictures on the thing.
1040523	1044126	Ray Ayanami in chat says, there aren't any OLR fans at Fonamay anyway.
1044146	1044706	There's a few.
1044746	1048269	There's the one guy who every year we're there asks Loki some Mac question.
1048669	1049910	Like, why are you such a Mac hater?
1050370	1051631	There's some kid every year.
1051651	1052632	Because of you.
1052652	1053553	Because of you.
1055663	1057244	That should be your response next year.
1057744	1058045	All right.
1058805	1068972	Because of stupid design decisions, like, for example, iTunes doesn't work with Windows XP 64-bit for no reason whatsoever other than we want to be douchebags.
1068992	1070453	Wait, Windows 7 64-bit?
1070633	1072454	No, Windows XP 64-bit.
1072494	1072935	Yes, it does.
1073835	1074736	No, it does not.
1076197	1077077	No, it does not.
1077177	1077638	Trust me.
1078440	1080861	I have experience.
1081101	1082481	It will not let you install it.
1083181	1084682	Wait, there's an XP 64-bit?
1085102	1085922	I didn't even know that.
1086462	1088042	I know there's Windows 7 64-bit.
1088062	1088883	That's what I run now.
1090003	1090823	But, alright.
1091083	1094364	It does not support it for no reason other than Mac is retarded.
1095484	1096925	Yeah, you're not a designer, so.
1097485	1102886	Alright, can we please get on to gaming news and not the PC Mac Wars again?
1102966	1103546	Jesus.
1103726	1105927	I put up the pictures on my bookshelf since it's awesome.
1106687	1107989	Gaming News, Loki
1121824	1126308	Microsoft to possibly launch an Xbox Live television channel.
1127169	1132473	Now, this isn't necessarily going to be a channel that we see on TV focused around the Xbox.
1132953	1135756	It's actually going to be something that's going to appear on Xbox Live.
1135796	1142902	Apparently, during an April 12th meeting at Microsoft's Reverend Washington office,
1143682	1156973	Chairman proposed a channel native to the Xbox 360 that would feature reruns and original shows for an additional $1-$2 per month on top of the standard Xbox Live subscription fee.
1158895	1185028	and so it's basically Peter is talking to lots of people about lots of ideas in the digital space and of course Microsoft is not commenting on it but it kind of fits with the rumor that we had last week that apparently Conan was in talks with possibly Microsoft for doing his show on Xbox Live it's kind of interesting
1187284	1188385	I don't think it is.
1206661	1207241	You know what I mean?
1207802	1208662	Well, it's very risky.
1208682	1211604	What were the realistic chances of Conan going to Xbox Live anyway?
1211904	1214946	It's very risky being that it's not established yet.
1214986	1217167	You don't know what kind of benefits and stuff.
1217207	1220349	And if the whole thing flopped, then it would be a wasted opportunity.
1221069	1225652	So it's a more safe bet for him to go to TUS.
1226232	1227433	But, you know, if...
1232176	1236859	If Netflix and all that works on Xbox, then why can't this?
1238079	1239300	I think this would be a good idea.
1240140	1243002	It just depends on the amount of content that's on here.
1243022	1257510	Because a lot of people nowadays with cable and satellite bills getting higher and higher, if this is only going to be the equivalent of possibly $12 to $24 a year and the content's good, a lot of people would probably jump on that.
1258180	1261362	I know I would if it's got some good shows on there.
1261662	1265565	And even just shows that are on normal cable TV or something like that.
1265885	1266905	I'd be all for that.
1267766	1278733	Wouldn't that be ironic though if you were getting your television through cable but it's your cable internet that you're getting your TV through because your Xbox is actually your cable provider?
1278973	1283896	Well, thanks to the FCC and Comcast and stuff like that, I'm sure that
1286441	1295348	since now they're trying to not pass those laws and stuff that they'll be able to filter it out.
1295408	1295948	Oh, Comcast.
1296048	1299011	Oh, you want to get TV through our cable internet?
1299031	1299892	No.
1300112	1300832	I'm sorry.
1301032	1301733	That's not going to happen.
1301893	1303314	I really hope that doesn't stick.
1303995	1311821	I think something's going to happen where that's going to... The minute those little loopholes get exposed, that stuff's going to get revoked plain quickly.
1312221	1314303	But hopefully it's not just wishful thinking.
1314503	1315284	I'll be really sad.
1317020	1320041	But maybe it'll go a long way in trying to get some competitors to Comcast.
1320061	1321581	Like people will come back to them?
1322081	1322741	I don't think so.
1325162	1330263	As far as the Xbox channel goes, though, I remember last week we kind of had a discussion.
1330283	1336664	I had brought up the PlayStation Tester and all that stuff, and you said something like you didn't really want to watch the Tester because you thought it was going to be a big commercial for Sony.
1337144	1340385	Well, wouldn't an Xbox Network be a big commercial for Microsoft?
1340685	1342465	It all depends on what content's on there.
1345086	1345567	Here's the thing.
1345687	1351610	The tester where the prize is becoming a Sony PlayStation tester.
1352551	1352871	Come on.
1353311	1356633	I mean, of course, it's going to be focusing on a lot of the games that Sony has.
1356993	1360175	And people are like, oh my god, I'm so excited to play the next big Sony game coming out.
1360255	1361716	I mean, that's retarded.
1361856	1368660	And yes, if there was something like that on the Xbox TV channel, I wouldn't want to watch it either because it would just be a waste of my time.
1368760	1370561	It would still be a damn commercial for something.
1371241	1379288	Now, if they had something that was, you know, mainstream, like something that's on TV, for example, that might be, you know, that's different.
1379308	1384893	You know, if they had like episodes of The Office or something like that playing on there or just whatever.
1384913	1386955	Yeah, but I can get The Office signing onto Netflix.
1387336	1387876	You know what I mean?
1388837	1389998	Well, I don't have Netflix.
1390979	1391659	Oh, okay.
1391860	1392640	I guess you got me there.
1392821	1394702	But Netflix is so cheap.
1395443	1396604	Is it a dollar a month cheap?
1397243	1398203	No, not that cheap.
1398243	1398983	Yeah, see?
1399003	1400944	Alright.
1401024	1403144	But you'd have to pay for this TV thing too, right?
1403244	1404105	Isn't that what they were talking about?
1404245	1406405	Yeah, like an extra dollar or two a month.
1406425	1407505	That's what they're looking to charge.
1407765	1408586	I guess that's not that bad.
1408906	1411246	Would I have to pay that Microsoft phony points?
1411446	1412126	I don't think so.
1412266	1412766	Probably not.
1413267	1414047	That might be interesting.
1414687	1418488	It'd be interesting if it wouldn't be just... Because, you know, we talk about Xbox, Xbox, Xbox.
1418828	1424629	But why wouldn't... I mean, if Microsoft's going to launch a TV station, why wouldn't it be available on your computer?
1425473	1427835	Why wouldn't it be available on your Windows mobile phone?
1428676	1429777	Something to compete with the iPhone.
1429877	1432119	Well, who says it's not?
1432380	1435703	I would think that an Xbox network is not really an Xbox network.
1435763	1437985	It's a Microsoft network.
1438857	1458269	well doesn't I mean they have MSNBC maybe streaming stuff from that I don't know I think the MSNBC agreement's a little funky I think it's a little more NBC than it is MS at this point but I don't know I don't know the ins and outs of how all that works so I guess I should stop trying to sound like an expert and move on to another story
1459693	1474701	Let's talk about the PlayStation 3 since we've had a little bit of Xbox news and talk about PlayStation 3 and there is some feathers being ruffled on the PlayStation 3 this week and it has to do with the game Final Fight Double Impact or as I call it Magic Sword Double Impact.
1475761	1483445	You see what's happened is that this game will just not run unless you are signed in online on your PlayStation Network account.
1484145	1489608	If you try to load the game and you're not signed in, you're just going to get a message that says you need to sign into the PlayStation Network.
1490327	1500601	Well, you know, I know a lot of people, myself included, it doesn't really matter because with the PS3s having the wireless, you know, internet built in and everything, I'm pretty much always connected to PlayStation Network.
1500641	1504707	There's very little time I'm not playing the PS3 and I'm not online.
1506369	1506630	But...
1507811	1515020	I mean, what if my internet went down and I wanted to play a video game, which I do a lot when my internet goes down to kind of pass the time.
1515160	1518264	You know, if I can't play WoW, I guess I'll go play Xbox or PSN.
1519004	1522448	So, I mean, this thing's kind of weird.
1522529	1525392	This is no better than the Ubisoft thing, in my opinion.
1525592	1530855	No, it's not... You have to understand why they're doing it in the first place.
1531095	1536579	They're doing it because Sony has this thing, and it's kind of a loophole, basically.
1536959	1548265	They had a thing where if you download a title, say you buy whatever, you know, a game, Flower, or something like that, you can repurchase or redownload Flower onto five different systems.
1548926	1554029	Say your system dies or whatever, instead of having to, you know, change your...
1556034	1556634	and so on.
1581869	1589111	Capcom apparently wanted to try something because they didn't like the fact that they're losing out on 80% of their sales potentially.
1590032	1593533	So what they're doing now is they're limiting that to one person now.
1593633	1596714	So you have to be the person that bought it in order to play the game.
1597114	1606477	So not only are they making you be online, they are also limiting the fact that you can't share this or re-download it again unless you're the person that used it.
1606917	1612399	And if it turns out to be a success, this is going to be something that's going on with all their titles going forward.
1612639	1617661	Well, what's also interesting about this, Capcom actually issued somewhat of an apology later in the week.
1617701	1621982	A couple days after this news hit, Capcom actually sent out a statement saying,
1622142	1645681	Capcom would like to formally apologize for the issues consumers are having with the PS3 version of Final Fight Double Impact Typically, the notification for a required PlayStation Network connection appears in the full game description when a game is downloaded from the PlayStation Store Unfortunately, when populating this content, this detail was overlooked and wasn't included in the versions of the game that released in North America and Asia It was included in the release for Europe
1646061	1652488	Capcom should have checked to make sure the notification was included when the final game was made available, and we sincerely apologize for this oversight.
1653409	1656373	The DRM requirements for Final Fight Double Impact are not unique to this release.
1656673	1660958	This protection mechanism has been implemented in numerous games offered on the PlayStation Store before.
1661414	1661854	Which ones?
1662634	1663255	Yeah, I don't know.
1663275	1663695	I don't know.
1664315	1671157	When it was brought to our attention and the notification was missing, we acted quickly with Sony Computer Entertainment America and a fix is on the way!
1671537	1671957	Yay!
1671977	1672917	They're gonna fix it!
1673057	1673497	Wait a minute.
1674198	1676098	They're not really gonna fix the DRM, are they?
1676158	1677919	They're just gonna fix the description.
1678659	1679079	Probably.
1679179	1679479	Don't!
1680919	1682340	That's the hidden subtext there.
1682860	1688962	We would like to thank our vigilant fans for bringing this to our attention and we will exercise better scrutiny on future Capcom releases.
1689042	1690663	Next time we might use some lube.
1694164	1695545	Honestly, here's the thing.
1696305	1703368	It sucks that you have to be online and yeah, okay, it will suck that you won't be able to play Final Fight if your internet goes out.
1704128	1704728	Big deal.
1705128	1705789	Play something else.
1706009	1709130	I mean, seriously, that can't be the only game you're playing.
1709930	1720914	and finally, I mean, really the whole reason they're doing this is because people are exploiting a feature in the PlayStation 3 that's really meant for if your system craps out so you can re-download your content.
1721394	1724055	Do you really want that to be removed later on?
1724195	1727316	You know, because you have people complaining about it and then your console dies.
1727456	1727796	Oh, guess what?
1727816	1729196	You gotta download everything again.
1729316	1730857	I mean, you have to re-buy everything again.
1731994	1733095	Hackers of America, break me
1759577	1763258	It's the same type of logic that you apply to children.
1763298	1764439	Tell them they can't do something.
1764479	1765179	What do they want to do?
1765759	1766099	Do it.
1766259	1772921	Why don't they just send a fancy wedding invitation on the fancy paper that says you are cordially invited to hack the fuck out of this game?
1774202	1777262	Because people can't really hack the PlayStation Network right now.
1777623	1778203	Right now?
1778603	1780283	This is because they took the Linux out.
1781584	1782284	But they'll be back.
1782304	1785845	Okay, I'm booting whoever this recruit is in chat room.
1786685	1787286	New rule.
1787406	1788346	You have to have a nickname.
1790630	1797300	Well, you would have to have one if you want me to read your name, because otherwise there's nothing to read when you guys make lovely chat comments.
1799096	1799876	Jamie's on the warpath.
1799956	1803198	I'm getting sick of people who just come in and ghost.
1803358	1806240	And if you want to ghost, make I am a ghost for your nickname.
1806980	1809061	But otherwise, don't just be there.
1810762	1811763	They could be a spy.
1812263	1813443	They're not a spy.
1813544	1813964	They are.
1814004	1814644	I'm kicking them.
1815024	1818106	What's going to stop a spy from just saying I'm a normal person?
1819126	1819967	They gave themselves a name.
1820387	1823649	God, that's... Aw, and right as soon as they gave themselves a name, they got kicked.
1824890	1825030	Aw.
1825371	1826211	See, you guys are mean.
1826612	1826872	All right.
1827612	1828833	Chat.OrganizeRadio.com.
1828853	1830054	Some actual comments from chat.
1830354	1835278	Bochikawa, whether or not they want to get more sales still makes a hassle for the regular legitimate user.
1835578	1837940	That's going to cost some sales from people not liking the hassle.
1838200	1841622	You know, Loki, not everybody's home is wired to be on the internet all the time.
1841642	1842223	Then how are you going to...
1842483	1843444	Download the damn game.
1843464	1845525	Well, not wired to be on the internet the whole time.
1846106	1852050	What possible situation would you have other than your internet going out that you would not be on the internet?
1852591	1854732	You can't dial up and download games.
1854752	1856714	Maybe not everybody has wireless internet in their house.
1856934	1860216	So they actually run a wire when they want to download something, then they pull the wire when they're done.
1860897	1862998	So they're going to have to run that wire every time they want to play the game.
1863198	1864459	All the way in the kid's bedroom or something.
1865460	1865760	I don't know.
1866101	1868102	I don't think Final Fight's a really good kid's game.
1868362	1868983	Well, you...
1869683	1876208	When I say kid, it could be a 15, 16 year old where, you know, if I had a 16 year old, I wouldn't care if he was playing Final Fight.
1876609	1877549	I could think of worse games.
1879031	1884535	If they really are out of shape, I'm sure they have, you know, a computer.
1884615	1886817	Download MAME, download the ROM, done.
1887057	1887497	Look at that.
1887577	1890940	Don't even have to be connected to the internet and it doesn't cost you anything.
1891020	1894883	Frisbee says, and what incentive does paying for DRM infective programs give?
1896897	1901260	I think the subtext I'm reading there is that when you know this is the case, you should just not buy it.
1901860	1902801	Or buy it on their system.
1903301	1904202	I did buy it on Xbox.
1904242	1905443	I had no idea this is the case.
1905483	1911366	Apparently a lot of people bought it on Xbox because this took a few days to come out, the news, which maybe says something right there.
1911527	1911887	I don't know.
1912847	1920612	Regardless, we're going to see the DRM mania continue for the next few years, I'm sure, as we get into the next system.
1920652	1922494	That sounds like a Photoshop to me.
1922594	1924755	Just take drum mania and remove the U out of it.
1926287	1927588	I was thinking the same thing.
1928569	1931490	What if the only thing you can find is a percussion freaks machine?
1932311	1933552	Then you're not looking hard enough.
1934052	1935193	DarkSakura, what you got for us?
1935393	1935913	Good news!
1937854	1938775	Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
1940516	1945019	They've released the poster art and there's already speculation as to who is going to be in the game.
1945999	1949781	And so it goes without saying that everything we said last week, yeah, it happened.
1949881	1950101	Yeah.
1950261	1950861	Yeah, it happened.
1951462	1963627	So, of course, for the confirmed characters, we have Morgan, Chris Redfield, Wolverine, Hulk, Ryu, and Iron Man.
1963747	1965668	Is Chris Redfield the Jill Sandwich guy?
1967137	1969119	Shermie's trying to get out.
1969379	1972221	Yeah, from Resident Evil.
1972821	1973682	Him versus the Hulk.
1973722	1976244	I'm surprised he hasn't been stepped on and just gone squish.
1976704	1981588	Yeah, the little trailer they put up was pretty freaking cool.
1981788	1982969	What did you think of the art style in it?
1983989	1984370	I liked it.
1984990	1987872	It totally actually made me think of Street Fighter 4.
1988272	1989493	I've heard some mixed things on it.
1989533	1992395	Not everybody I've talked to was a fan of the art style in the trailer.
1992415	1993136	Well, they can suck it.
1993416	1995838	It's just like Tatsunoko versus Capcom if you ask me.
1997142	2005645	At any rate, the speculation on who the other characters are, and a lot of these I actually... Although I have a few speculations of my own from this.
2006945	2013968	They're showing Felicia, Super Skrull, Captain America, Doctor Doom, although...
2014708	2016450	I'm sort of thinking Taskmaster, maybe.
2016870	2019212	Anyway, Deadpool, of course, duh.
2019692	2020973	Chun-Li, who cares?
2021413	2022194	Question mark person.
2022214	2022634	Yeah, I care.
2022674	2023215	I love Chun-Li.
2023615	2025036	Oh, yay, question mark person.
2025796	2028699	I just happened to be looking and they haven't identified that person yet.
2029279	2032822	There's one back there that could be Iron Fist, Black Widow, or someone else.
2034123	2035824	Dante and Frank West.
2036738	2040359	Fuck yes to Frank West Hell yes
2067310	2069711	Yeah, Dormammu was in it.
2069831	2072071	Well, they're saying Mephisto got crossed out.
2072292	2072972	I think that's funny.
2074552	2075933	But yeah, I don't care.
2075953	2076453	I just want it.
2077233	2078833	And you're just going to play Deadpool all day.
2079014	2080134	Yeah, just Deadpool all day long.
2081074	2082535	He has to talk the whole time, though.
2083315	2087176	It's not Deadpool if he does not talk your ass off the entire game.
2087196	2089257	So they're going to have to pay his voice actor a lot.
2090197	2090797	We'll see what happens.
2090817	2093998	And I also want the guy to do the voice actor who does Deadpool in Friends.
2094508	2098111	Now, there was some reaction in our chat room to you going over those names.
2098391	2101514	We had Actdeft yelled out, Deadpool!
2102275	2104977	And then Wyland followed that up by saying, Bea Arthur!
2106138	2110122	Now, I don't remember what Capcom game Bea Arthur was in.
2110282	2111383	Was there a Golden Girls game?
2111443	2112284	No, I have to explain this.
2113485	2118869	Deadpool has or had a major obsession with Bea Arthur.
2119770	2120431	And who doesn't?
2121608	2121989	B. Arthur
2142166	2142867	I never knew that.
2142947	2145188	You know, I only, you know, I don't really read comics.
2145228	2146028	That's no secret.
2146228	2147329	You know, I just, I just don't.
2147689	2153072	But I liked the character in the, what, Iron Man movie when Ryan Reynolds played Deadpool?
2153232	2153973	He played Wade.
2154113	2155314	Well, he was, well, he was funny.
2155974	2156174	Yeah.
2156194	2156654	And lulled.
2157875	2164239	That's pretty much the type of nonstop talking your ear off I want to hear except, you know, more nuts because he is crazy.
2166020	2171643	So sadly, they weren't talking about any type of like actual Bea Arthur being in the game.
2172051	2178518	Now they're bringing a Deadpool, and of course, Deadpool has to be followed by Bea Arthur, and someone hasn't said Chimichangas.
2178778	2182201	Why wasn't there a Golden Girls video game, actually?
2182282	2187046	Can you imagine, like, firing up, you know, PlayStation Network, you know, and hopefully the DRM, you guys can still play the game.
2187086	2188408	The Cheesecake is a Lie!
2188508	2193573	That's right, and then, you know, you just turn it on, and then... The Cheesecake is a Lie!
2194174	2195395	Thank you for being
2200569	2203114	What exactly would you do in the Golden Girls video game?
2203756	2204457	Eat cheesecake?
2204958	2205760	Blanche would be a hoe.
2207223	2208345	Sophia would be angry.
2208706	2210690	She'd have her anger snark meter.
2212503	2212823	You know what?
2212923	2214844	I would like to see this as an XNA game.
2215124	2219645	Like, I realize you can't do a Golden Girls XNA game because copyright, IP, da-da-da-da-da.
2219925	2224626	But there's no reason you couldn't do a senior... Silver Ladies.
2224666	2225887	The Silver Ladies.
2225927	2229748	The Silver Ladies, you know, adventure game or something.
2229768	2235089	I always thought it was funny that Estelle Getty played Bea Arthur's character's mom, yet she was younger.
2235969	2236869	That's what they call makeup.
2237089	2237890	I love Estelle Getty.
2238310	2238610	All right.
2239502	2240242	I like Bea Arthur too.
2240262	2241042	I used to watch Mod.
2241783	2242563	Reruns of Mod.
2242963	2243643	I love them both.
2243683	2244323	Rest in peace.
2245624	2247824	Betty White hosting Saturday Night Live next week, by the way.
2248664	2249224	No, May 8th.
2249464	2251185	Betty White doing a roast.
2251585	2252225	I saw her.
2253465	2254426	It was something else.
2254446	2256646	She was participating in a roast for somebody.
2256826	2258307	She is snarky.
2259027	2259367	I love her.
2259913	2262654	SSJ100 Matt says, Rob, I'll tell YYR to get right on it.
2262714	2264995	Please, please make that happen.
2265155	2267496	I don't care who does it.
2267517	2268417	We need that to happen.
2269057	2270938	Ranma says, call it three old biddies.
2271138	2271999	Actually, weren't there four?
2272379	2274480	Well, I guess one was the mom, so whatever.
2275560	2278281	SSJ100 Matt says, wait, wait, is this an OLR dream game?
2278521	2280062	This is a Rob Roberts dream game.
2280082	2281003	Three biddies in the hoe.
2287222	2288884	I don't think it's just me.
2289084	2289825	I don't think it's just me.
2305462	2306002	And wow.
2306142	2311485	And I was like, this is my new favorite person that I've ever heard on a podcast.
2311845	2313906	She named her character after the Golden Girls.
2314106	2320308	And I think Michelle or somebody else popped in and said, yeah, I named one of my priests Betty Smite.
2324528	2326629	That's it.
2327169	2334992	My next Star Trek character is going to be... I'm just going to name her Sophia the Old.
2336593	2338754	And pick the old person face and everything.
2339134	2340835	And make her super short and Ferengi.
2341335	2344156	I'm going to put that on the list of people I want to have on OLR in the future.
2344196	2345536	The chick that named her character is Zbornak.
2345556	2347697	Because that's awesome.
2348117	2349478	You're a true inspiration to us all.
2350003	2356575	Alright, let's move on to other gaming news Loki's just sitting here going, what is this show tonight?
2357237	2357738	I don't know
2359574	2380968	Well, just like Nintendo to delay some stuff, actually just like anybody to delay some stuff, but Nintendo in this particular instance has delayed two upcoming games that are very highly anticipated, including Sin and Punishment Star Successor and Metroid Other M. Sin and Punishment's only been pushed back a few weeks, from June 7th to June 27th,
2382630	2390036	and, unfortunately though, the Metroid Other M game, which was originally due on June 27th.
2390497	2392378	Well, that's been pushed all the way to August 31st.
2392799	2395901	Oh, that was the day after my birthday and I'm going to have to wait two more months.
2397563	2400466	That gives me enough time to actually hook up my Nintendo Wii again.
2401867	2403168	I haven't plugged it in since I moved.
2405208	2406729	Why are these games being delayed, Loki?
2407569	2411890	No reason was given other than it's Nintendo just doing Nintendo things.
2411970	2419112	Do you think that maybe the games aren't finished or they failed some type of quality check or what?
2419392	2420973	I don't think that they're not finished yet.
2421113	2425674	I think that they're just spacing out their titles for the rest of the year.
2425794	2426155	I mean...
2427595	2431896	They had two games coming out in June that really didn't have anything on the plate for the rest of the summer.
2433697	2437198	And maybe polishing Metroid Other M a little bit more.
2438898	2442059	Or maybe they're going to add some gimmicky crap to add on to it.
2442999	2448721	I hope to God they're not delaying this to add on some vitality sensor support or some crap like that.
2449581	2450441	Oh, I hope not either.
2451622	2454402	Well, at least you'll get to play it at E3, I'm sure.
2455483	2456683	Yeah, I guess that's true.
2457406	2464196	Alright, well, all this news about the Nintendo Wii and the delays leads me into a little something I want to do on tonight's show.
2464216	2471527	We don't do this very often, especially on the podcast, but we're gonna do a little something called Secret Club tonight is what we're gonna do here on the show.
2473712	2474493	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2494655	2498757	I have secrets where it's like, hey Rob, I have a secret.
2498837	2502018	And if you tell anyone this, I'm going to beat your fucking ass with my shoe.
2502458	2503518	Those I don't tell anybody.
2503798	2508000	But then there's the ones that's like, hey Rob, I found out this little piece of news and I don't care who you tell.
2508560	2510321	So this is a little something secret.
2511021	2511722	The Black Nintendo Wii
2532170	2533750	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2553975	2571392	and apparently this actually ties into something we've heard about before because this is the bundle that's also going to include we're not sure and the details were a little sketchy from my source because he couldn't remember if it was that it was coming with just the Wii Motion Plus or if it was the Wii Motion Plus and Wii Sports Resort.
2571412	2571852	It's Wii Sports
2573113	2579980	But Loki has previously heard of that there was going to be a new bundle that matched what we saw at Walmart before, but we're putting two and two together.
2580400	2584844	What Loki had probably heard about before is actually going to be this black Nintendo Wii bundle.
2585365	2585725	That's right.
2587970	2596533	There was no color specifications or anything, just basically that they're going to be releasing new bundles soon and that we probably weren't going to get any.
2597774	2598975	Because they're dicks.
2599315	2602936	And folks from chat, I haven't heard anything else about the specs.
2603036	2604037	No, it's not HT.
2604157	2604917	Dream on, guys.
2605157	2606398	No, it's just a Wii.
2606498	2607779	It's just another bundle.
2608319	2610520	It's the same damn Wii, except here's the difference.
2610580	2614882	Instead of white plastic, they used black plastic instead.
2615322	2615863	That's it.
2616463	2617905	Don't expect anything else.
2618105	2619487	So, sorry, it's not HD.
2619567	2627776	And you might be getting an extra free game, because I'm assuming they're also including Wii Sports in there, so you get Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort.
2627936	2629818	It'd be nice if they added another controller into it.
2630939	2631279	I doubt it.
2631299	2632841	Okay.
2633081	2634362	I think it's supposed to be the same price.
2634622	2635263	I'm not positive.
2635323	2635623	It is.
2635843	2638185	It's going to be the exact... I must have forgot to say that.
2638245	2640948	It is the exact same price as the Wii you're paying for today.
2641148	2643089	So in a way, it's a bit of a price drop too.
2643350	2648394	So I wonder what they're going to do with the... I think it actually may be replacing the old Wii SKUs.
2648474	2649034	I think it is.
2649374	2651076	So white Wiis are going to be rare.
2651136	2651556	That's right.
2651576	2652097	Super rare.
2653017	2655478	TigerClaw in chat says, a BlackWee is a no-brainer.
2655518	2659859	We sort of had a hint of that recently when we saw a BlackWee moat on the most recent trailer for Metroid Other Realm.
2659879	2661479	Well, they're already selling BlackWee moats, aren't they?
2661499	2661879	Yeah, they are.
2663099	2666900	And then the folks overseas are saying, ah, we've already had the BlackWee.
2666940	2667760	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
2669041	2670361	I'm not controlling the news.
2670801	2671501	I don't write the news.
2671541	2672221	I just report it.
2672261	2673662	The BlackWee is not out in the States.
2674102	2677062	So they're finally getting it May 23rd.
2677102	2678343	And that's what I'm telling you is the date.
2679263	2679423	May 23rd.
2681750	2685272	Alright, yeah, it's already been out in other parts of the world.
2685292	2686312	Don't they have other colors too?
2686412	2687813	Like, remember E3 years ago?
2687853	2690574	There was like a pink Wii and a blue Wii and all this other stuff?
2691435	2691735	I don't know.
2692896	2694276	Let's see, Tiger... No, I'm sorry.
2695117	2698538	SSJ100Matt says, So wait, the black Wii isn't bigger than the white Wii?
2700019	2700699	Ha ha ha.
2701340	2702180	Ha ha ha.
2702240	2703881	Everybody's a jokester here at Orange Laundry.
2703901	2704862	Ha ha ha.
2707443	2709664	Going back to something we were talking about a little bit earlier...
2711129	2717714	TigerClaw sent me this link in chat, and I just have to share this with you guys, this link on YouTube that is just pretty fabulous here.
2720216	2729182	This is what could be... It's an actual... Somebody did this on the NES.
2729222	2730443	It's like a hack or something.
2730503	2736147	I don't know what... I don't know what that is.
2736187	2738609	Some type of hacked NES cartridge or something.
2742734	2744837	So somebody's already started making my dream game.
2744917	2747640	All right, let's move on to some real games, shall we?
2747660	2748341	How about Halo?
2748401	2749542	Hey, don't tune out.
2749583	2751164	Halo, I've got Halo updates.
2751285	2753567	Halo, Halo Reach specifically.
2754148	2756952	Halo Reach apparently is going to, well, you know...
2758593	2759793	Halo Reach is coming out soon.
2784072	2788616	Limited version has a special case, collectibles, and in-game armor.
2789576	2795841	The $150 option apparently has all of that, but also has, I guess, more unique packaging and in-game armor.
2796361	2799343	Also, a legendary Noble Six sculpture.
2800124	2807349	I don't know if that's anything like the little Master Chief hat that you could put on your cat for lols, but you couldn't really put it on your cat, just so you know.
2807469	2808910	But sounds kind of similar.
2810331	2814693	Can't you still get that Halo $150 edition for like $60 now discounted at price?
2814713	2816273	There's people still sitting on that stuff.
2816353	2816734	Oh, yeah.
2817234	2817594	Oh, yeah.
2817794	2818414	I'm not surprised.
2818474	2820995	Hopefully this will sell a little better, but we'll see.
2821555	2824917	What do you think about all this game coming out in three different flavors, Loki?
2825657	2828678	They did it with Halo 3, and it was kind of fun.
2829118	2834320	But hopefully people have learned, you know, you don't need to spend the money to get a fake helmet.
2834780	2837041	At least this has a nice sculpture that comes with it.
2837962	2838842	I wouldn't pay that, though.
2840583	2843805	Yeah, because if you think about it, you're basically paying, I mean, between $80 and $150.
2844065	2845887	You're paying like $70 for the sculpture.
2846027	2849409	You could use that money to get another game if you wanted.
2849609	2855913	Or you could use it to invest and have $200 next year.
2856554	2856894	All right.
2857775	2858315	But there it is.
2858855	2862738	I realize there are the fans that will pay that money to have every little thing Halo.
2862758	2864259	And who am I to criticize?
2864319	2867461	If it was Final Fantasy XIV, I'd probably be doing the same thing.
2867701	2869322	I'd be like, $150, that's it?
2869342	2870143	I'm paying the money right now.
2871884	2872424	DarkSakura.
2873285	2879829	Well, we've got some word from BimaniStyle about Stride Nasty stuff that's sponsoring it.
2879929	2884152	And keep in mind, I am completely allergic to it and I don't even like to say the name of it, so it's nasty.
2884472	2885753	I'll say it, Stride Gum.
2886053	2886454	Nasty!
2888567	2889468	Save the Arcades 2.
2892249	2900633	But Arcade Infinity is actually one of the ones up in the competition for it.
2901933	2906055	AI has been a really big staple in the Bitmoney community.
2906075	2907476	They had all the imports in.
2907736	2909837	They also had that weird Gundam game that was so cool.
2910357	2912618	And little Japanese ticket games.
2912718	2914659	And Jammer Lamy.
2914899	2916740	And it's in LA, in case you didn't know.
2916760	2916960	A little...
2917620	2919241	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2937797	2940520	And that's where Loki, did you play some crazy porn game there once?
2940560	2941161	It was really funny.
2942162	2943924	I played a lot of crazy porn games there.
2944384	2948429	That's where I first played Gal's Panic and Dancing Eyes.
2949321	2955223	But at any rate, the competition is going on until June 15th.
2955683	2963826	And they're talking about the AI, the owner says that if they win, they want to get Tycho and Jubit.
2964786	2971528	But you have to play a game of Cowbots 2010 and donate your final score to the arcade you wish to support.
2972248	2974469	And that's at savethearcades.stridegum.com
2975089	2978252	Well, I mean, is Arcade Infinity in, like, danger of closing or something?
2978272	2980353	I mean, haven't they been threatening to close for a little while now?
2980413	2986238	I don't see anything really about... But they're talking about if they won, they'd get a Jubeet machine and all this other stuff?
2986298	2987519	Or Ubeat or whatever it's called?
2988260	2988700	I guess.
2989281	2989541	Weird.
2989601	2992143	It's just going on the... Hmm.
2992523	2993384	The little board there.
2993624	2994405	Uh, we're not picking you up.
2994465	2995326	Did you turn your mic?
2995506	2996086	I'm talking.
2996307	2996427	Oh.
2996727	2997528	You weren't talking in the mic.
2998508	2998548	Oh!
2998729	2999009	Alright.
3000447	3001448	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3025263	3028465	Um, start things off with Super Street Fighter 4.
3028725	3032427	That's going to be coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3033507	3041712	Uh, Nier, that kind of a beat-em-up game from Square Enix, coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week as well.
3042712	3046393	Dead the Rights Retribution, also on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3046774	3067281	If you're a fan of sexual innuendo and boobies, Record of Argus War, the limited edition or the, what was it, the naughty, I forget, some naughty edition or whatever, coming out on Xbox 360 does include a mouse pad with fake boobs on it and a pillowcase with some chick on it.
3067901	3069022	So that's going to be kind of neat.
3070402	3081887	Harvest Moon Hero of Leaf Valley coming out on PSP Splinter Cell Conviction making its way out on PC this week with wonderful DRM in tow and
3083442	3088665	FreeRunning, a parkour sim, coming out on the Wii this week.
3089926	3099352	2010 FIFA World Cup, South Africa, coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and PSP.
3099632	3101173	I don't think there's a DS version on that one.
3103535	3103675	Um...
3106793	3109014	I believe that's it.
3110174	3111935	Oh, no, this is actually a pretty good deal.
3112295	3118116	PixelJunk Monsters Deluxe making its way out on PSP in the UMD format.
3118136	3122558	They've had this originally on the PlayStation Network, but now you can buy it on UMD.
3123218	3123398	Only $10.
3125679	3127759	And it includes, I believe, some of the expansions for that.
3128059	3131460	They're doing the same thing, too, with Fat Princess coming out a little bit later on in May.
3131980	3134181	So, not a bad thing at all.
3135493	3137615	Any of that that you're going to pick up, Loki?
3139416	3141177	Let me try Super Street Fighter 4.
3142638	3146040	Yeah, I'm going to pick up Super Street Fighter 4.
3146200	3151184	But this time I'm getting it on PS3 because I would like to actually be able to control it better.
3152024	3153305	So that's my whole thought there.
3154066	3155367	That's why you get arcade sticks, Rob.
3155967	3156948	Or just play it over here.
3157068	3158289	You're talking more money.
3158769	3160010	But they're worth it.
3160991	3167779	and Xbox 360 in Japan sees the release of Super Street Fighter 4 this week as well in a regular and collector's edition.
3168260	3171444	Otherwise, Splinter Cell Conviction is your other big release in Japan this week.
3171484	3174648	See some of the same games we're getting here also get released in Japan at the same time.
3174708	3175249	Imagine that.
3176510	3178271	Looking at some other consoles.
3178891	3180512	Going over to the PlayStation 3.
3181073	3181934	Same, same.
3181994	3183695	They also get Super Street Fighter 4 over there.
3184395	3185676	Regular and collector's edition.
3186357	3192601	World Soccer winning 11-20-10 gets a price reduction for whatever that's worth if you're a big fan of these soccer sims.
3194082	3203587	On the Nintendo Wii, not really a lot this week, Base Fishing Wii World Tournament, Andukensa X, and a game called Rooms comes out as well from Hudson.
3203627	3205408	That's all on the Nintendo Wii this week.
3206149	3211692	On the PlayStation 2, I like the name of this game, Love Route Zero, Kiss Kiss Labyrinth.
3212552	3214174	Yes, that's really the name of the game.
3214274	3216956	Love Root Zero, Kiss Kiss Labyrinth.
3217076	3218137	It's an adventure game.
3218678	3220399	I have no idea what you do in this game.
3220419	3222041	There's no screenshots.
3222121	3227065	But the box art looks to be like all these dudes in school outfits.
3227746	3229648	But there's this girl who looks like the prom queen.
3230088	3232190	Yeah, why am I trying to figure this out?
3232350	3233251	None of you are going to play it.
3233431	3234032	I already know that.
3234072	3234853	None of you are going to play it.
3235974	3239797	Going on to the handheld systems and looking at what is coming out on the Nintendo DS.
3239977	3245162	Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 2 is a big release from Squeenix this week on the Nintendo DS.
3246182	3251487	And lastly on the Sony PSP, Iki Tosun Cross Impact.
3251527	3255570	And that cross is spelled with an actual X, just to be complicated.
3255951	3257572	That is coming out in Japan this week.
3258553	3261816	That is a sequel to a former PSP game.
3262957	3266259	2D scrolling action, 22 girls in this beat-em-up game.
3266299	3266980	No, it's not Arcana Heart.
3267040	3268801	And their clothes come off, sort of.
3269121	3270182	Is that really what this is about?
3270202	3271683	Well, that's what Ikitoshin's about.
3273044	3275246	Based on what I've seen, I guess.
3275486	3275787	Nice.
3275867	3280030	No, it's they fight and their clothes rip in very provocative ways, I guess.
3280550	3308523	also Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker I bet some of you guys might want to get that there's also a full PSP pack for that game coming out and I just like the name of this game Marriage Royale Prism Story is also coming out it's an adventure game I don't really know what happens in this game I guess it's like you play the girl going to get married but I want to point this out there's a screenshot here where you have these three cute little anime girls they're like working out or something but they forgot their pants that is tragic actually
3309093	3309573	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3327857	3333919	Alright, so if you want some culturally different things there, you can check out that game, but you probably won't.
3334400	3336520	Alright, how about the UK, DarkSakura?
3336921	3337861	Yeah, how about them?
3338441	3339001	How about it?
3339302	3342203	On the 28th, Serious Sam HD, The Second Encounter.
3343303	3345904	The 30th, 2010 FIFA World Cup, yay.
3346745	3349125	30th, God of War Collection, Iron Man 2.
3350666	3359391	Splinter Cell Conviction, Super Street Fighter 4, WarioWare Do It Yourself, and Wings of Prey.
3361412	3361852	That's it.
3363013	3366795	Too bad it's not the Birds of Prey making its way to a video game.
3366815	3368035	That would be kind of awesome.
3369936	3370236	Or not.
3370617	3371317	Alright, Loki.
3372778	3373218	Ah, yes.
3375359	3377640	Okay, so we talked a little bit.
3377840	3379121	I said that we had
3380638	3384622	Splinter Cell Conviction coming out this week and there's horrible DRM in tow.
3384682	3386703	Well, that might not be that big of a problem.
3387264	3394570	Apparently the hacker community, which I thought this happened weeks ago, but maybe they finally figured out how to do it the correct way.
3394730	3399675	They have found a way to get rid of the DRM that's in
3401380	3401760	Skid Row
3424488	3424888	Fun name.
3425668	3426208	Awesome.
3427469	3429229	And, you know, it is a little bit different.
3429509	3441791	Before they had different hacks that were just emulating the authentication server or they were finding some way to trick this, but this actually removes the DRM from the title.
3442411	3444652	So that's interesting.
3444832	3452033	Now, Loki, your pal Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, the hack before worked up until a certain point of the game, then it locked up.
3452153	3454956	So this must be news that now it's working for the entire game.
3455697	3456397	There you go.
3457899	3461623	So, Loki, I mean, does this really surprise you?
3461643	3464425	Because I kind of look at this and go, yeah, I already thought this happened too.
3464866	3467008	I thought this happened within days after the DRM.
3467969	3468710	I'm not surprised.
3469490	3472674	Especially, you know, something like this that's annoying a lot of people.
3472854	3473314	Not only...
3475235	3482198	The fact that they're coming out and saying, oh, this is going to stop piracy of our titles, it just goes to show you're going to waste money on this.
3482698	3485879	I mean, it slows people down, but it definitely doesn't stop it.
3486739	3490260	And really, in the end, the only people who get hurt are the people that legitimately buy the game.
3490280	3495102	Of course, now, if you don't like the DRM, you can just go search online for the crack.
3496634	3499177	I understand the need for DRM.
3499457	3504202	I'm not somebody who says, oh, every game should just not have DRM at all.
3504663	3506605	I just think what Ubisoft was doing was overkill.
3506625	3507386	I mean, come on.
3507426	3510669	When you disconnect from the internet at all, your game dumps.
3511069	3518898	Do you know how much I get disconnected from World of Warcraft because Comcast decides to fart on me and I'll be in the middle of something and it completely screws up my game?
3520559	3524661	Oh my gosh, at least that isn't a long-term irritating thing.
3525121	3532525	Whereas I could see if I'm playing through one of these games and I'm not at a safe point, maybe I just cleared a really tough part of the game, it's like, oh, you're screwed, you've got to do it again.
3533025	3539708	Yeah, it'd be different if it was like, okay, we noticed it disconnected, we're saving your progress now.
3540629	3542990	And you can restart here later once it...
3543590	3544111	I don't know.
3544131	3545652	The thing is, I'm not buying their games on PC.
3545692	3547093	Even if I were buying their games, which I'm not.
3547113	3547173	So...
3563927	3591304	Alright Well, a couple last stories for you guys Then we're going to get into the classic game of the week Where DarkSakura is going to walk down the vaults of gaming's history And pick out a game that she thinks you kids ought to check out this week But first, something about a newer series Something that's kind of been a bit under the radar And I think that is a pity And that is DJ Hero DJ Hero, of course, we know that DJ Hero is getting a sequel this year And little, little details are starting to trickle out about it
3592044	3614580	DJ Shadow apparently is going to be working on the next DJ Hero He actually said in an interview on Radio 1 It was interesting, I'm actually working on the next one as well But yeah, it was a trip So there you go, he's going to be in the second game Also notable, he was in the first game too So he's like a repeat And I kind of figured that would happen How many world famous DJs are there?
3615541	3616362	Are there really enough?
3616382	3617362	World famous guys.
3617383	3618043	There's a lot of them.
3618103	3620465	World famous, meaning America famous too.
3620485	3623007	There are a lot of DJs, I think, out there that are world famous.
3623167	3629171	But how many of them are you going to get to be in DJ Hero?
3629552	3636777	I was very disappointed that they had DJ Jazzy Jeff and there were no Will Smith songs in there at all.
3636917	3639519	No mixes with Will Smith track in there.
3639780	3641041	That was very disappointing.
3641321	3641521	Mm-hmm.
3643203	3643823	Well, there you go.
3643903	3648746	DJ Shadow is going to be in the next game in DJ Hero 2.
3649106	3651568	But DJ Hero 1, All Love Is Not Lost.
3651948	3653269	Loki, you'll be happy to hear this.
3653329	3655090	There's actually another track pack coming out.
3655130	3657111	Yeah, this one I'm actually kind of excited about.
3657131	3658512	The last ones kind of suck.
3659272	3683599	Darude's Sandstorm mixed with Josh Wink's Higher State of Consciousness is one of the songs in the new DLC Danny Bird's Red Mist VIP is coming out as well and then this song Wolfgang Gartner's Wolfgang's Fifth Symphony let me start off by saying that this song reminded me of something that you would see in DDR and here's a little clip of what this song sounds like
3700792	3701156	and me.
3705034	3706235	Boom Boom Rocket, The Domination Pack
3736698	3738139	But yeah, I guess that song sounded okay.
3738499	3739520	It was a little noisy for me.
3740801	3742842	But I guess that's because there was so much mixing going on.
3743062	3743362	I don't know.
3743823	3745383	I think that that's the thing.
3746744	3748445	Some of the effects are a little overdone.
3748545	3751007	There's people that are going to like it, don't get me wrong.
3751227	3751667	Good for them.
3752207	3753728	Alright, I don't know if I'll buy it.
3754189	3755990	I'm curious to hear what the other songs sound like though.
3756550	3762874	Anyhow, let's get to the part of the show where we like to take a trip down the halls of gaming history.
3764944	3771667	DarkSakura is going to jump into the vault and dive in and find a game that she says, hey, you ungrateful little children.
3772227	3775809	Because she says that a lot when she's not teaching him Doctor Who references.
3776189	3777850	I didn't teach him that.
3778270	3778770	Oh, my bad.
3779111	3780391	He watches Doctor Who.
3781652	3787394	You kids ought to be playing this classic video game so you can see where the games of today came from.
3787835	3790796	DarkSakura, what is the classic video game of the week this week?
3791346	3804459	Warcraft, Orcs and Humans Oh snap I put it in for all of you addicts who don't know your roots Fair enough, Warcraft, Orcs and Humans Freaking boring ass game
3806448	3807529	This game is awesome.
3807589	3808350	Shut your mouth.
3808610	3808890	See?
3810051	3811092	I wanted that reaction.
3811632	3816916	So I didn't put this in really for me because I hate real-time strategy games.
3817137	3817877	I don't like them.
3817977	3818998	I do not have fun with them.
3820339	3823341	But there are enough of you who don't...
3824362	3830070	I actually mentioned to someone, I was like, you know, when World of Warcraft was coming out, I was like, so did you play Warcraft before?
3830090	3830831	No, it just came out.
3844867	3845668	Poor child.
3845788	3846088	I see.
3846108	3848210	So tonight is about edumacation.
3848510	3849511	It's about edumacation.
3850292	3851813	So yeah, it's a real-time strategy game.
3852393	3856757	It came out in 1994, November 1994, and came out on the Mac in 96.
3857978	3860861	And it was a sequel, Warcraft 2, Tides of Darkness.
3861041	3863583	And then, of course, Warcraft 3, Warcraft.
3864103	3869348	Warcraft 3 came out not too long ago, which if you look on Dan's little shelf there, he's got a copy.
3870289	3872170	So Dan obviously likes it.
3873591	3885621	Um, and, uh, it's basically, um, you know, like I said, real-time strategy where you have the humans of Azeroth against the invading orcs.
3886541	3887722	Ooooooh.
3888183	3890304	And then both sides have to fight off wild monsters.
3891145	3892126	Ooooooh.
3892426	3894147	But sometimes you can enlist the monsters.
3894708	3895408	Ooooooh.
3896550	3901075	So basically you've got your melee groups, you have ranged groups, and spellcasters.
3902317	3911408	It is built off of the Dune 2 gameplay, which is like build a base, build an army, destroy the enemy, blah blah blah.
3912269	3923500	Different mission types where you have rebels of each player's size so you can rescue rebuilt towns and friendly forces and do all this other stuff.
3924601	3928164	And you also had to be able to efficiently use your platoon.
3930746	3934410	Also in one mission you have to kill the orc chief's daughter or something.
3936232	3943400	It also let you use land so that you could play against each other.
3943520	3946584	So it had that start of the MMO, remember?
3949347	3950007	Sort of, yeah.
3951989	3953831	Like the old school Battle.net, yeah.
3954132	3956094	But I was more Diablo on Battle.net.
3956872	3959494	Well, you have to go through with this.
3959514	3961775	You also have to cultivate your resources.
3961836	3967079	You have to be careful about where you dig for gold, where you chop your wood.
3967700	3971943	If you exhaust your resources, then you have to get them differently.
3973444	3976566	You have to basically regrow your forest while you're
3976846	3976886	Um...
4006227	4018452	Yeah, you know, it actually was... See, I thought that it was... I played some a little bit, but like I said, I don't really care for RTS games.
4019673	4020853	I'm sort of like, what?
4021234	4023174	I can play them, and I'm good at them.
4023274	4024315	I'm just sort of like, what?
4024355	4024975	This is boring.
4026156	4031558	But it clearly caught on, I mean, because remember we had StarCraft.
4032999	4033659	You know, the whole...
4035071	4040575	I guess themes to the game sort of caught on to and now we've got World of Warcraft making it less sucky.
4043297	4046639	Again, this is Jamie who does not like RTSs.
4046899	4050622	I actually own this game and I loved it.
4052183	4058628	There is actually an RTS game that I like but it's a Macross game that came out on the PC Engine CD.
4059440	4077786	I will say this though, I am weird I fully admit I'm weird because I don't really care for StarCraft and I to this day have never played Warcraft 3 we've got it right here I just for some reason have never played it I really should because maybe some of the stuff in World of Warcraft would make more sense but yeah, I have played the old school Warcraft and I did play Warcraft 2
4079129	4093898	And I actually tried to make it a point to put in games that I can be really excited about, but it was just, you know, it seemed to me that with everybody being all World of Warcraft, World of Warcraft, blah blah blah blah blah, you know, it helps to know where it came from.
4094038	4095179	It helps to go back to your roots.
4096560	4102983	So as far as other ones that came out, though, it did have some predecessors, things that actually...
4105264	4109966	would inspire the game and build the groundwork for it.
4110046	4112827	There was definitely some competitors.
4115468	4120169	Like I said, Dune 2 and then Warcraft Works and Humans came out after that.
4123390	4128832	And then there was actually a random map generator that was for it.
4129512	4132033	And that came from Civilization Robots.
4134380	4135801	I thought that you'd find that interesting.
4138183	4148493	Command and Conquer actually borrowed from Warcraft and Age of Empires put all of them in in the random map generator when it came out.
4149674	4156240	Modern Wars for the Commodore 64 incorporated the use of land play.
4158317	4162999	So it really, not only was it influenced by some others, but it actually pulled influence.
4163399	4169241	It's actually even listing Realms as an old Amiga and Atari ST game as being an influence on it.
4171862	4178325	And of course for sequels, we got Warcraft 2, Tides of Darkness in 95, and Warcraft 2 Beyond the Dark Portal in 96.
4178365	4178525	And then...
4182643	4186664	Coming out later, of course, was Warcraft 3, Reign of Chaos.
4187384	4191866	And then there was StarCraft, like I said, and StarCraft Brood War and World of Warcraft.
4192386	4194246	And soon StarCraft 2 for URTS fans.
4194306	4195907	Yeah, I was about to get to that.
4196107	4196547	Oh, sorry.
4197307	4200008	So yeah, Warcraft, you know, it's expanded.
4200108	4202048	There's card games, comics.
4202168	4202969	There's a ton of books.
4203169	4204409	You've seen the books, I'm sure.
4205349	4209731	There's actually a film called Warcraft in production to be out in 2011.
4212037	4213658	Yeah, Spider-Man dude's doing it, right?
4214238	4215058	And Army of Darkness, right?
4215078	4217679	Yeah, I think there's also board games too.
4219200	4227443	But yeah, Warcraft really did kind of spur a whole, you know, a whole big thing.
4229123	4231144	11 million people can't be wrong, or can they?
4233146	4233426	Addicts.
4234106	4234406	Addicts!
4234847	4236147	Your classic game of the week.
4236267	4239908	A true classic indeed in every way, shape, and form.
4239948	4241009	Don't listen to DarkSakura.
4241029	4243730	No, I'm not saying it's a bad game.
4243850	4245970	I'm saying I don't like RTSs.
4247731	4249492	And even, that's including ActRaiser.
4250072	4251952	Warcraft, oh, you don't like ActRaiser?
4252052	4253973	I didn't say I don't like ActRaiser.
4254533	4255874	ActRaiser is a good game.
4256034	4258815	I get bored, bored, bored after a while.
4258835	4259555	Oh, I'm gonna cry.
4260669	4266478	Rob, there's a difference between thinking something is crap and just not liking the genre of it.
4269013	4270153	Yeah, I can see that.
4270173	4271934	I'm trying to think if there's something I feel that way about.
4271994	4275035	I do every so often, like, you know, smiting people in Actraiser.
4275616	4280217	See, I would say that's how I feel about sports games, but, like, I can go back and play old school sports games, no problem.
4280237	4284099	Like, I love Tecmo Bowl, Blades of Steel, like, the way they used to be before they just got... Super high impact.
4284659	4286800	Like, yeah, before they got, like, really complicated.
4287680	4288961	But that's my point, you know.
4289681	4293403	I'll start playing and I'll be like, yeah, this is cool, and then I'm like, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
4294663	4295904	Not my thing, not my thing.
4296144	4298266	I might have liked Warcraft, but I wasn't very good at it.
4298366	4299547	I never got very far in it.
4299827	4302129	Like, I'm not good at RTSs.
4304091	4306813	This whole thing, I can do the strategy just fine.
4306973	4308074	I just get bored with it.
4308174	4310856	It's not really my thing.
4312137	4312858	Alright, fair enough.
4316643	4321146	If you would like to suggest a classic game of the week, too bad, DarkSakura doesn't take suggestions.
4321166	4322026	By the way, actually.
4322287	4323427	But you could always try the mailbag.
4323728	4324828	I need help from the chat room.
4325669	4330292	I'm looking for a PlayStation copy of NBA Jam.
4332048	4340330	If you find it, no matter what variety of version it is for the PlayStation, first PlayStation, let me know.
4340670	4341590	What's the reason?
4341790	4342490	Dan wants it.
4343630	4345791	And it's actually hard to find.
4346351	4346671	Really?
4346931	4347151	Yes.
4348551	4351252	We are looking to add it to the collection because we have everything else.
4352812	4354613	We want completion for our NBA Jamage.
4354733	4355673	Boom shakalaka.
4357666	4359088	He's on fire!
4359108	4365717	He's been seriously back there in the vault playing NBA Jam for days in a row.
4365817	4368580	If you could find the PlayStation 1, you could play it on a PS3.
4369441	4370122	Which is the cool thing.
4370162	4373126	Because PS3s, they all have backwards compatibility no matter what one you have.
4373286	4376007	Yes, but we also do still have a functional PlayStation.
4376288	4376668	Oh, nice.
4377848	4381811	That still had the IO port and everything so we can use our little clip-in thing.
4381971	4382751	Good times.
4382771	4383812	But I want help finding it.
4384572	4387353	Even if you find a... I don't want to say this on the air.
4387694	4390255	Even if you find a burn of it somewhere, let us know.
4390735	4395738	Because really, we're wanting to just check it out, but we would prefer a legit copy.
4396358	4396639	Alright.
4398220	4399261	You might want to look at chat.
4399301	4400322	Somebody's speaking up there.
4400382	4402044	Lama Juice says, I think I have a copy.
4402724	4403645	Oh, there you go.
4403665	4404486	You better go find that out.
4404947	4405207	Alright.
4406288	4412013	If you would like to help DarkSakura out, mailbag at orangeentree.com or join our chat room right now, chat.orangeentree.com
4412830	4415812	Hey guys, that's the end of Part A, but we still have plenty more show to come.
4416412	4422617	We have more to come in Part B tonight, including some other news out of the Capcom event this week.
4422657	4425058	I mean, a lot of it we reported last week as rumors.
4425098	4425899	They've turned to fact.
4426259	4428500	But we do have some extra details to come with that.
4428541	4429581	We'll get into that as well.
4430262	4432643	Some big rumored games for Xbox Live Arcade.
4433504	4436566	Some more in the ongoing Infinity Ward saga.
4437106	4442630	And much more coming up when we come back after a break here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4442790	4442910	Thanks for watching!
4449332	4450053	Marvel vs. Capcom News
4479532	4484598	DRM Debate, Television on the Xbox, and plenty more news to go through this week.
4484778	4487721	Loki, why don't you start us off with some fast news tonight?
4488902	4493727	Yes, there's some WiiWare releases coming soon on May 17th.
4494948	4517365	including the next title in the Bit.Trip series, Bit.Trip Runner will be coming out that day on WiiWare and also there's some summer DSiWare release dates as well to share including Photo Dojo which looks like a side-scrolling fighting game that uses a DSi's camera to add you to the game.
4518606	4519967	That's kind of neat, I guess.
4520767	4521808	Kind of gimmicky, but fun.
4524390	4533257	Earthworm Jim, coming out also on May 10th, and apparently I guess that's going to be an update to the SNES version of the game.
4537180	4539181	Really, another Frogger game.
4540442	4544186	Frogger returns yet again on... People must be buying him, Loki.
4544206	4545487	They wouldn't be selling him.
4545907	4547349	Konami has Frogger.
4547749	4548390	Go Konami.
4549811	4557038	Metal Torrent on May 24th is an Akira-developed shmup game.
4557658	4558799	It looks pretty awesome.
4559940	4565604	Uh, Xscape is, I guess, a sequel to a Game Boy title.
4566824	4569686	Or, I guess, a title X from Q Games.
4570907	4573768	And, uh, it's like a first-person tank combat game.
4574809	4576270	But really trippy looking.
4577350	4579391	And then, uh, some other stuff coming out.
4580132	4580212	Um...
4582341	4589948	Hero of Sparta on May 31st, Flame Trail on June 7th, and A Cappas Trail on June 14th.
4590649	4592550	Then also, another title that's going to be...
4594790	4597611	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4616278	4622860	Trick the user into viewing the environment in a three-dimensional fashion.
4623240	4629041	You basically tilt the screen around, and doing so will change your perspective in the game.
4629421	4632682	It's basically kind of a hidden objects game, I guess.
4633282	4635483	It looks kind of cool, so that will be coming out as well.
4636607	4639408	and then non-DSI related stuff.
4640528	4652832	Battlefield Heroes is going to be getting some more upgrades in the form of jetpacks as well as some new maps and new game mode.
4653892	4657773	They're going to be getting... That's funny.
4658053	4661914	I forgot that they had the Michael Jackson content that one time.
4663115	4663375	Anyways...
4665709	4678392	I guess they're going to be getting a new map called Midnight Mayhem and a new mode that's going to be called V2 Vengeance where players must capture and control a giant rocket.
4680672	4684593	But hey, look, see they're bringing out jetpacks before Halo Reach can.
4687173	4689234	Do you think that's why they're doing it?
4691134	4692414	Maybe to get the jump on it?
4693035	4693455	I don't know.
4694675	4695295	Just to be fun.
4697270	4699372	Super Breakout from Atari
4721110	4723572	Pitfall and Megamania from Activision.
4724273	4725434	I don't remember Megamania.
4725474	4727355	Is that a game that rings a bell to you, DarkSakura?
4728176	4729477	Megamania by Activision.
4729878	4731419	I know the name, I just don't remember the game.
4731599	4732280	I can't remember it either.
4732320	4733120	I certainly know Pitfall.
4733821	4735162	Night Stalker from Mattel.
4735202	4736223	I'm assuming that's in television.
4737044	4741727	Rack Em Up by Konami, Real Sports Volleyball by Atari, and Basketball by Atari.
4742168	4743929	So those are all some new game room releases.
4743969	4746832	Certainly I think Pitfall and Breakout are probably the standouts there.
4747112	4748253	Although I want to say Megamania.
4748793	4749214	Ringing a bell.
4750074	4751676	But there's some other stuff on Xbox Live.
4751776	4754918	This week we had Puzzle Chronicles and Afterburner Climax.
4754938	4757460	You know, I meant to check out Puzzle Chronicles, even though it looked a little weird.
4758100	4759781	The next week is Tecmo Bowl on the 28th.
4759841	4760322	Woohoo!
4761002	4761943	So that's pretty cool.
4762783	4767226	Also some Mega Man 10 releases on the 28th.
4767487	4769988	The Endless Attack Mode and two more special stages.
4770028	4771710	Special Stage 2 and Special Stage 3.
4772650	4775913	And then Bioshock 2 gets the Rapture Metro Pack on April 29th.
4776673	4780475	I'm surprised that they're even doing that, seeing as the game came out, what, two years ago?
4780495	4780975	I mean, seriously?
4801380	4803422	Farmeville is expanding beyond Facebook.
4823358	4828521	And this would be because of a website, I guess, that spies on domain names that people are registering.
4828981	4840507	And Zynga, the company behind Farmville, has registered FarmvilleAndroid.com, FarmvilleiPad.com, FarmvilleiPhone.com, and FarmvilleSMS.com.
4840907	4845050	And those are all domain names that are registered by the Farmville folks.
4845670	4846170	There you go.
4847031	4850032	By the way, I guess they're all also forwarding to Farmville.com.
4850532	4851153	So there you go.
4852353	4856574	Yeah, so needless to say, FarmVille is slowly taking over the world.
4856674	4857575	Run while you still can.
4858575	4861576	No further word about Fishville or any of that yet.
4861696	4865957	Also worthy of mention, there's a rare NES game called Euphoria.
4866077	4869518	Not like EU, but U-F-O-U-R-I-A, Euphoria.
4869978	4873739	It's been rated by the OFLC, which is the Australian Ratings Board.
4873839	4877420	This means that a virtual console release is likely possible today.
4877720	4881722	What's interesting about this game, it's pretty rare, but it was actually done by Sunsoft.
4882062	4886944	You might remember Sunsoft recently as kind of having like a re-arising or a re-awakening, if you'll call it.
4887425	4889406	They put out Blaster Master on Virtual Console.
4889446	4894348	There was that OK Blaster Master upgrade game that also hit Virtual Console.
4894768	4921980	now apparently Euphoria the Saga is coming out as well it's a Metroidvania type of game is what they're saying it's a NES game and it stars this character you get separated from his friends and you are looking through the world for your lost companions I guess it's kind of like Goonies 2 in that regard hey actually that sounds kind of awesome Goonies 2 is kind of Metroidvania too so there you go the game was released in Europe just so you know but I don't believe it was ever released actually in the US hence why it's rare nope
4922821	4929401	so there you go, Euphoria, possibly on Virtual Console, but usually those ratings news means, yeah, yeah, they're coming it's a cute little game
4929964	4937205	Real quickly before Jamie takes over with some news, the chat room is again complaining that the stream had failed and I guess we blacked out for a little bit there.
4938126	4940446	Unfortunately, we don't know what causes it.
4942347	4951348	Bobby Blackwolf wants to clarify because you guys are hearing that little bumper that says, all games is switching between it's live and on demand, then that must mean it's on our end and it's not the all games computer.
4951408	4954629	However, we are not doing anything out of the ordinary.
4954729	4956369	There's no one else's here but us threes.
4956389	4958030	There's no Xbox games going on or nothing.
4958430	4959110	So you can thank
4959770	4961452	Jamie's lovely internet provider.
4962093	4962854	Comcast.
4963515	4964396	It's Comcastic.
4964696	4967019	They were a wonderful shade of crap this morning.
4967059	4967499	You know what?
4967579	4969922	My Warcraft has been going down, too, in the area.
4969962	4971284	So you know what?
4971344	4972906	Nobody's running porn.
4973086	4974007	We did a porn check.
4974888	4975529	Everything's fine.
4976370	4978192	We gotta keep on rolling with the show.
4978272	4978693	Sorry, guys.
4980214	4984418	Oh, by the way, I do want to clarify that specifically it is tournament edition.
4985139	4987821	NBA Jam tournament edition for PlayStation that I'm looking for.
4988822	4989163	Nice.
4989423	4992125	Yes, there's some on Amazon, but Dan hasn't told me I can buy it yet.
4993527	4995388	Anyway, broadband updates.
4995549	4998291	We have some new tracks coming out.
4999612	5002856	There is Busted, Thunderbirds Are Go for $160.
5005518	5021510	Microsoft Points and 200 Wii Points Flyleaf again and Silverchair tomorrow I don't see anything about an actual pack just the three tracks also somebody finally beat Castlevania with a DDR pad
5024615	5043120	The old school Castlevania, like the first one, this dude named Nick Hagman played the Virtual Console original Castlevania using a DDR Mario Mixed Controller and it took 62 lives in more than 4 hours, but he did it.
5043260	5047162	Wait a minute, I'm looking at the YouTube here of the guy, I guess, who did it here.
5047222	5048063	Let's see if we can fast forward.
5048083	5049404	I don't want to hear his little monologue.
5049424	5050384	I just want to see him play.
5051045	5055147	And it looks like he's... Is he really stepping around, or is he just kind of like... I think he's sitting.
5055868	5058509	Well, in some pictures, he's just sitting, kind of using his hands.
5058549	5061051	But now in this YouTube, I'm looking where he's fighting Dracula.
5061651	5063913	He is actually using his feet to do it.
5064333	5064573	So...
5066314	5071718	because I was going to criticize this a little bit if he was actually just sitting there kind of hitting the buttons, but apparently he's actually dancing around.
5072078	5075841	I wonder if this kid lost weight doing it, although he looks pretty skinny to begin with.
5078643	5078943	Wow.
5079263	5081605	I slayed Pounce and Dracula.
5082305	5083946	Congratulations, I guess.
5084767	5085447	Yay for you.
5086268	5087789	You have more time than I do.
5088149	5088950	A winner, it's you.
5091435	5093477	Marvel vs. Capcom comic books
5109183	5111685	The Adventures of Deadpool and Dan
5137625	5151232	Deadpool and Dan The actual Dan is here to say something Disney vs. Capcom Disney vs. Capcom I want Deadpool and Dan How would that work?
5151312	5154254	Deadpool and Dan Alright
5157059	5157539	Show us your tweets.
5176829	5177510	Where's the tweets?
5177550	5177970	Here we go.
5178070	5182955	TheShadowSniper sent us some tweets saying, I'm unable to listen live because I work late Sundays.
5183375	5185037	I do carry around my Blackberry.
5185097	5187319	Is it possible to listen live through my phone?
5187939	5195166	Ooh, unfortunately, we know of an iPod app, an iTouch app, and I guess it runs on the iPad, so iEverything app.
5195986	5223024	that's the all games radio app if you just search for all games or allgames.com in the iTunes store that's a great way to listen unfortunately you're asking about the Blackberry my advice would be get one of those there's got to be like a radio tuner type app depending if your Blackberry has apps you would actually be able to tune into the feed directly it's just a shoutcast feed so any feed that will do shoutcast streams you can listen to all games radio on so check that out
5224065	5231170	TheShadowSniper also asks, what game ending is your favorite because of its twist ending or its great conclusion?
5231210	5234052	This is a good topic I don't think we've talked about in a very long time.
5234433	5236194	Favorite video game ending, DarkSakura?
5237435	5237655	Huh?
5238076	5239036	Favorite video game ending?
5239217	5240177	Favorite video game ending.
5240417	5241198	It was a twist?
5241859	5242499	Doesn't have to be.
5242899	5246823	It says, what was your favorite because of its twist or great conclusion?
5246883	5246963	Okay.
5249568	5250248	I don't really know.
5250829	5251609	I don't really think I have one.
5251629	5253551	I mean, I loved all the million endings for Chrono Trigger.
5254331	5255512	You know, that goes without saying.
5256353	5259214	I loved the multiple endings for Symphony of the Night.
5260455	5262116	Oh no, Richter's dead.
5262297	5264558	Oh no, he was controlled by Shaft.
5265439	5265759	You know.
5267180	5272964	I have to say that my favorite ending is Maria's ending from Dracula X.
5273700	5280224	Where she's walking along with her little happy mamba music and all of her little animal buddies are following her along.
5281245	5283407	Yeah, because that really goes with the Castlevania game.
5285248	5285568	Loki?
5286469	5288130	I like the ending to Final Fantasy VI.
5290692	5296015	I was kind of going to go along those lines too and say Final Fantasy 4 was actually my favorite ending.
5296035	5298176	It was like a 20 minute epic ending back in the day.
5298736	5299436	Good stuff.
5299496	5300577	That was one of my favorite endings.
5301798	5306500	As far as like a twist ending, I'm trying to remember games that had like a twist that made me go like, oh my gosh.
5308121	5308421	I don't know.
5308441	5310642	For some reason I'm not thinking of any off the top of my head right now.
5311563	5314924	Plus, you have to remember I have gamer ADD so I don't beat a lot of video games.
5314984	5317305	I play them for about an hour and then I'm like, ooh, shiny.
5317325	5318826	I'm going to go play something else.
5319547	5319687	So...
5320547	5336447	but yeah you know the Final Fantasy series is always dependable for good endings I think those are definitely up there so alright also I always love the endings in Street Fighter 2 the little stories that were just so random and you know those were always favorites of mine too
5337488	5345733	Uh, let's see, SpazinatorPSN says, I can't exactly say when, but hopefully if all goes well, down the time I anticipate some epic news.
5346554	5347934	Well, you can't just leave it at that.
5347954	5349475	You gotta say what the epic news is.
5350876	5356019	Okay, Tigerclaw gives us like a ton of gaming links, and we don't have time to read them all.
5356079	5357280	I'm sorry, it's kind of a lot.
5357320	5358661	We got a lot of Twitter topics tonight.
5359121	5360582	But I'll read at least a couple of these here.
5361142	5361182	Um...
5362643	5367547	Yosho Inori Ono says, ask Capcom if you want another Darkstalkers game.
5380658	5381379	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5398016	5406001	So, anyhow, he says that he always tries to talk about Darkstalkers in interviews, and he wants to show Capcom that there's a demand for a new game.
5406061	5409303	He says, quote, I am desperate to make this game.
5410243	5411484	That's a pretty bold statement.
5411904	5414286	So, you know, flood Capcom with your letters.
5414546	5421790	You know, when you're going to send your hate mail about their DRM, you might want to just send some postcards to it and say, oh, by the way, PS, new Darkstalkers, please.
5422791	5424052	But don't screw it up with DRM.
5424172	5424732	Don't you dare.
5427642	5431306	Sony is going to be discontinuing the 3.5 inch floppy disk in Japan I want a box of them
5446014	5447535	To make something out of them.
5466491	5471114	They were first introduced in 1981 and really sold broad in Japan in 1983.
5472314	5484061	They had their peak in the year 2000, but as you can probably imagine, now that you have USB drives and CDs and other types of storage mediums, whatever happened to zip drives?
5484721	5486782	Remember, zip drives are going to be like the next big thing.
5486842	5489464	I still have like three zip disks around here somewhere.
5489784	5491725	I have a zip drive, or I had a zip drive.
5492513	5493694	Remember the zip drive?
5493954	5495215	That's what I used to download stuff with.
5495395	5497176	I make my portable drive.
5497916	5498777	So there it is.
5498857	5500458	Bye-bye, three-and-a-half-inch sloppy.
5501238	5503359	That's like when they got rid of the Polaroids, man.
5503379	5504320	Remember when that happened?
5505100	5505400	All right.
5506601	5506901	Let's see.
5507021	5507421	One other one.
5507461	5510643	I'll give Tigerclaw one more story because I'm nice and he gave a lot.
5511304	5517427	He also sent us a link to a story about early 3D games on PS3 featured downgraded graphics.
5518287	5520208	It's a story he linked us to on Kotaku.
5520228	5521169	Oh.
5521189	5523651	That's a whole other thing we should get into at some point tonight.
5523671	5527493	Did you hear about the whole Gawker Media who owns Kotaku?
5528174	5529435	One of their other little websites.
5529455	5532056	Did you hear about this whole mess about the iPhone that was found at the bar?
5532296	5532597	Yeah.
5532637	5537340	And this company that bought it for like $5,000 or something like that and leaked all the information on it.
5537420	5539281	And now they want it back.
5539741	5540522	Well, they got it back.
5541363	5541943	What a mess.
5542083	5542864	In pieces, right?
5543184	5544905	No, that'd be $5,000, please.
5545585	5546926	Well, they probably put it back together.
5548387	5550589	But yeah, that was a sister blog to Kotaku, so...
5552307	5553047	Yeah, I don't know.
5553568	5557569	There's more I could say on it, but I'm kind of getting to the point where I just don't care.
5557830	5559150	It happened, whatever.
5559730	5562172	Oh my god, fourth generation iPhone?
5562192	5562512	I know.
5562732	5563172	What?!
5564092	5567054	I just think the way it all went... That is so surprising.
5567874	5570896	The way it all went down was a little bit, I don't know the word, I think tacky.
5571956	5576338	The one that really rubbed me the wrong way was the story they ran on the guy who lost it.
5577198	5577739	You know...
5579229	5580810	Hey guys, look what I brought with me I'm so drunk
5606306	5613836	does it necessitate him being splashed all over this blog and all the details about his Facebook and all this stuff it's tacky, it's just tacky
5615740	5625104	Anyway, so Tacky Website Sister reports that PS3 apparently might have some downgraded graphics.
5625144	5630607	I guess Wipeout HD usually will run in 1080p, which is considered, you know, it's the Uber HD.
5631307	5636189	It has to actually be scaled back to 720p to run in 3D.
5636289	5639030	MotorStorm, its top resolution was 720p.
5639351	5644393	It actually has to be scaled back to less than that, which would not even be considered HD, in order to run in HD.
5646034	5648775	That's not true.
5648895	5649916	No, less than that.
5649996	5650876	It's not considered HD.
5650936	5654758	It's basically pulling a Halo where they just up-res everything.
5656379	5658240	But it's not true HD.
5658320	5663663	Wasn't Sony the same company that marched out there and said, we have true HD on all of our games?
5663683	5666385	Yeah, just like all of our games are going to be 1080p running at 120 frames per second.
5666405	5667065	Smoke goes towards my ass.
5667125	5667425	Yeah.
5674429	5683356	It's not surprising that they're going to have to cut down the graphics a little bit, but I don't think you're going to really notice when everything's flying towards you.
5684257	5690241	Obviously, it's going to take more processing power to display those images.
5690341	5692323	It's going to have to refresh twice as fast.
5694099	5695939	Whatever, I'm so over 3D.
5696499	5697440	Like, fuck 3D.
5697740	5698400	Seriously.
5698600	5699300	I'm over it.
5699340	5700560	Like, now it's just like everything.
5700620	5705181	Every fucking movie's in 3D, and every game's gonna be redone in 3D.
5705201	5707261	3D this, 3D that, 3DS.
5707621	5708261	Fuck 3D.
5708762	5709182	Fuck it.
5711962	5712422	Blue Swim.
5712442	5713802	You're gonna get a 3DS.
5715343	5715703	Maybe.
5716343	5716803	We'll see.
5717043	5718723	If it hurts my eyes, I don't know.
5719523	5720364	Hey, I have one.
5720444	5722384	It's called Virtual Boy, and it gave me a migraine.
5723792	5724693	Alright, moving on.
5724753	5732958	BlueSwim on our Twitter sent us a tweet that says, Any thoughts on the new DDR game coming out for the 360 later this year that features Coldplay and Jordan Sparks?
5733378	5734499	And then links us to the thing.
5734899	5736100	I thought this game was coming out last year.
5736120	5737201	What happened to the last DDR game?
5737221	5739583	I thought that was going to be last year's DDR game.
5739623	5740163	What happened?
5740463	5741564	It got delayed a year?
5742405	5743645	It's not a new DDR game.
5743705	5745467	It's still that last one that hasn't come out yet.
5745687	5746867	The one that was at last E3.
5746908	5753412	They're like, we're just going to call it Dance Dance Revolution because that's not confusing at all.
5755727	5777209	Blue Swim, it's really hard to say until we see the game in motion I mean, I can look at the song list and go, meh, whatever But I really want to see if they finally took the advice of, you know, just rebuild the game from the ground up It sounds like they might have, because it's supposed to have all these new modes and stuff But I'm not going to hold my breath, let me put it that way I'm kind of over DDR, so it's going to take a lot to bring me back
5779355	5786660	I know that's a sad thing for me to say, but I guess even a new Beatmania 2DX game was announced this week, and I was just kind of like, eh, whoopee.
5788621	5789001	Whoopee.
5790582	5795566	Let's see, DarkTetsuya sends us a tweet that says, I found this on the LaMulana WeWear blog.
5795606	5798447	It's an interesting article about religion in video games.
5799028	5799348	Hmm.
5800329	5801870	All right, let's see what this is all about.
5801950	5803551	I'm going into the...
5816208	5819970	One of the difficult things when Japanese make games for foreign countries is the problems with faith.
5820411	5823213	From the historical background of Japan, the interest in faith has been weak.
5823673	5831398	It's difficult to understand the feeling of things such as making vows with a hand over the Bible during the presidential inauguration or how Islamic faith views the absolute moral.
5831978	5833660	I'd like to briefly explain the view of faith in Japan
5849258	5849938	Thanks for watching!
5867549	5870491	And the faith born from within the continent's culture exists a god.
5870891	5880737	Even though there is a difference between monotheism and polytheism, thinking about the many existing fears, living beyond a vast continent and harness of nature could have brought forth the absolute existence.
5881498	5885240	Da da da goes on to talk about the do not waste philosophy and so on.
5885880	5890323	Meaning there is no harm meant when Japanese games add elements from the beliefs of foreign countries.
5890703	5916100	and it can't just end there so what's okay and what's bad needs to be thought out because there's no such rule existing what's the best is to have the world's religionist check but that would not be possible so it's just kind of interesting to read this blog kind of talking about you know these guys having to consider this and all the development of La Mulana when you know it's maybe not such a big deal in some parts of the world but they've got to be careful not to offend because everything's got to be politically correct so
5917665	5923146	If you want to check that out, la-mulana.com slash en for the English one.
5923586	5926067	And this is called Problem of Faith.
5926207	5927907	And I'll link it to you guys in the chat.
5928347	5934608	But those of you listening to the podcast, la-mulana.com slash en for the English version.
5935149	5935349	Okay.
5936589	5937489	Last couple tweets here.
5937509	5939409	And then we got to close up the Twitter.
5940390	5943330	Alex P. Carson on Twitter says, 364 episodes.
5943810	5944270	Not bad.
5944330	5946291	You guys are my second favorite podcast.
5947302	5948083	Second favorite?
5949084	5949944	Second favorite?
5950685	5951666	Want to guess who we lose to?
5952267	5952487	Who?
5953207	5953828	Dignation.
5955509	5955790	I know.
5956650	5958152	Rob's going to have a diva stomp.
5958232	5959493	We're just going to have to try harder.
5959873	5961094	But he says keep up the good work.
5961194	5962115	No, I'm all joking.
5962395	5963156	You know, whatever.
5963496	5965879	I can say I've never listened to an episode of that show, so I don't know.
5965899	5967360	Maybe they're awesome and I just don't know.
5968013	5972535	It's, well, Kevin... Yeah, I know who's on it, but does that make me care anymore?
5972555	5972595	No.
5972815	5973975	This is so hard to read.
5974555	5974855	Alright.
5975456	5977376	Well, because it's a translate thing.
5977396	5978497	It's like a Google Translate.
5978997	5982758	Okay, I hope that's all it is, just because it's just kerned badly.
5983078	5990661	Well, it's developed by Japanese, obviously, so it's just probably run through the Google Translate.
5990821	5995003	And then Spazinator sends a last tweet saying, Sorry, I'm nixing the epic news.
5995143	5998405	Oh, well, I know something you don't know.
5998465	5998765	Never mind.
6001869	6002410	Whatever.
6003391	6004933	Let's move on with some more gaming news.
6004953	6007275	Then we're going to get to our Skype line a little later in the show.
6007296	6009098	1-877-GAME-OL-LARB.
6009158	6009478	Not yet.
6009518	6013062	We've got some more gaming news and mailbag and all that fun stuff.
6013102	6015625	Loki, why don't you get us back to gaming news?
6015705	6015906	Yes.
6015926	6021953	Well, one of the things that was announced, I want to say Tokyo Game Show, WOMAC.
6022453	6049660	was that for Dead Rising 2 they're going to be doing some sort of different things other than the last game of course one of them being co-op in the game and in fact they are going to allow you to play through the entire single player campaign with another person which is awesome and really the way they should have done it in the first place and then also let's see here
6050907	6053493	Great, and then that disappeared for some reason.
6053593	6054175	Go Comcast.
6056960	6063485	Now the other player that you play as, I'm not sure if it's, I guess it's a clone of your own character.
6064266	6067788	They're both Chuck Green, not some other character that you play as.
6068208	6070670	But it's going to be pretty awesome.
6070710	6072952	And they're going to have some different mini-games you can play as well.
6073973	6080377	I want to say there's like card playing and different events and stuff that you can do.
6082367	6090315	But hey, that's pretty sweet that they're going to have something other than just like that deathmatch American Gladiator-esque mode in the game.
6090776	6092557	Yeah, I gotta admit, co-op sounds kind of rad.
6092998	6094099	So I'm looking forward to that.
6094740	6095000	Yeah.
6095741	6099104	So, um, and then one of the other things I saw too, um...
6101003	6108028	They were talking a little bit about the demo slash prequel game that they're going to be putting out.
6108048	6111970	I want to say, what was it called?
6115293	6115813	I can't remember.
6115833	6125019	Anyways, that should be coming out pretty soon, I would think, because I think Dead Rising 2, if I remember correctly, is scheduled for August right now.
6127168	6132330	Well, right now, but we just heard about a bunch of other games getting pushed back, so maybe these games will get pushed back too.
6132770	6137072	Yeah, maybe, but Capcom usually doesn't move stuff around too much.
6138572	6139212	We'll see what happens.
6139832	6141153	God, I just can't wait to play the game, though.
6141913	6146855	Yeah, the more and more I'm hearing about it, the more it sounds kind of awesome, even if Frank West isn't in it after all.
6147835	6150116	Well, it'd be funny if he made a cameo.
6150416	6152657	I mean, you never know.
6153077	6155438	They're saying that he's not in it now, but I mean...
6157170	6160031	Bionic Commando Re-Arm 2 Re-Design Re-Build
6182985	6186687	And I guess the big thing now is that he can actually, like, jump.
6187167	6187467	Now.
6189228	6190169	That takes up the point.
6191049	6193050	Yeah, so now he can jump and use the arm.
6194471	6195011	So there it is.
6195051	6197792	That's the big change in Bionic Commando Rearmed 2.
6198613	6201694	It will be on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live the first quarter of 2011.
6203595	6205716	New weapons, attacks, and all that fun stuff.
6206016	6207837	It's being developed by Fatshark.
6207937	6209758	Because, you know, Grin did the first one, right?
6209958	6211259	And they're not there anymore.
6212320	6236121	New physics based puzzles, there will actually be a two player co-op in this game as well New graphics, new score, but it will be inspired by NES Which kind of brings me back to what makes this game very interesting in the first place Bionic Commando Rearmed was an upgrade of an actual NES game that existed called Bionic Commando So this is a sequel to a retro remake that isn't based off anything
6237121	6237682	Isn't that weird?
6237962	6239763	I don't know if it's not based off anything.
6239803	6243826	Some of the stuff reminded me of the arcade game by Commando.
6244027	6247449	Wasn't there a rumored sequel in development too that just didn't end up happening?
6248190	6253093	I want to say I had read a while ago that there was a rumored sequel in development, so maybe some of this is bits and pieces of that.
6253554	6260499	But still, the point remains, you have a sequel to a retro game that doesn't actually exist, which I find very interesting.
6261308	6261348	X-10
6289574	6289874	DarkSakura
6303678	6305340	Jet Set Radio Jet Set Radio
6322148	6335917	It could be, it could not be, it could have just been a placeholder by someone wanting to... You know, because Sonic 4 Episode 1 is on the list, but other stuff like Quake Arena Arcade, Xenoclash... That's real.
6336358	6336538	Yeah.
6336978	6337338	So it's real?
6337739	6338299	Yeah, it's real.
6338359	6346905	It's off of... That's the PartnerNet stuff, some of which has already been leaking online, and they're cracking down on it pretty big, so...
6347660	6348661	I was like, it's in French.
6349422	6352084	No, it's the same guys that released information.
6353045	6366757	I'm not sure if it's the same person, but those same games had screenshots leaked out because someone has a dev kit that they bought and they're releasing a bunch of screenshots and stuff from games that haven't been announced yet or aren't released yet.
6366777	6367878	Naughty, naughty.
6367958	6373243	And then there's a few of them, they actually leaked out the full games out there, so...
6375444	6382068	Yeah, but people keep going, okay, release Sonic 4.
6382169	6383529	Come on, come on, you know you want it.
6383950	6390974	And they're like, no, because they're cracking down on it and now they're password protecting a bunch of this stuff and they don't like that too much.
6391214	6397058	Well, I mean, I can imagine, but... Well, yeah, it's not meant for that kind of stuff.
6398339	6401701	Dev kits getting sold to random people.
6401721	6402482	Yeah.
6402768	6404468	I don't know what exactly that takes, but you can find them.
6404528	6404588	Hmm.
6427662	6428242	JTAG Consoles
6449426	6460836	Now, there's some other interesting stuff coming out from the Captivate stuff, including... These are some games that I believe were already out in Japan that are making their way out over here.
6461997	6465780	Okamiden is coming out on the DS later this year.
6466061	6467282	Or, actually, I'm sorry, in 2011.
6468062	6470885	And, of course, that's the sequel to Okami.
6473047	6474088	And it looks pretty awesome.
6474908	6475609	And then, of course...
6477688	6501674	I'm not sure if it's the creators of the Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney series but at least the same artists they're releasing Ghost Trick Phantom Detective that's going to be a brand new series and that's supposed to be making its way out later this year
6502854	6509819	And then, oddly enough, on the Wii and the PS3, Sengoku Basara Samurai Heroes is making its way out.
6510159	6512380	And I believe that's supposed to be later this year.
6515302	6521806	And that one came out, well, one of the games in the series came out on the PlayStation 2 a couple years back.
6523467	6530772	Which was, god, I just had the name, Devil Hunter, I think?
6533001	6533441	I don't remember.
6534042	6537223	But I thought that was the name of the series that came out over here.
6537464	6541626	It's basically like Dynasty Warriors but with guns.
6543927	6544327	Cool.
6544507	6544908	Guns.
6545488	6545668	Yeah.
6546028	6546508	Not really though.
6546528	6546949	I hate guns.
6547609	6554013	They've had at least one other Sengoku Basara game that was Basara I guess.
6554293	6557514	A game that was on the Wii a while back.
6557755	6560116	I want to say it was the first or second year the Wii was out.
6563667	6564627	They're kind of cool.
6565007	6565287	I don't know.
6567308	6568388	I just wish they was on the 360 too.
6568488	6570869	I just don't understand why they hate.
6571489	6580312	Unless it's going to be coming out at a time when they do have the motion controller in play and it's going to be something with that and then maybe I can understand why it's on the Wii and the PS3.
6580332	6582172	Other than that, it's just hating.
6583292	6583973	They're just hateful.
6584533	6585013	Why they hate?
6586273	6586913	Why I gotta hate?
6587113	6588354	Don't hate the play, I hate the game.
6590293	6595937	Anyhow, this is a game that I tried to like, but it kind of drove me bonkers.
6596017	6597858	But we had a little tidbit on it last week.
6597918	6601441	It's The Lord of Ultima, and it was actually released this week.
6601521	6605243	Yay, it was launched, and you can actually play it and have fun with it.
6605303	6608886	You have to visit the website, which I think was like lordofultima.com.
6609766	6611307	You can actually go and play the game.
6611447	6614069	I tried to play it, and it crashed on me during the tutorial.
6615030	6615770	So, yeah.
6615890	6616551	Yeah.
6617051	6632804	but apparently in this game you will set up your own little kingdom and there's little microtransactions and stuff I don't know, it sounds a little Farmville to me but with Ultima and you know, better graphics and all that stuff but I tried to play it, I wanted to review it for you guys but it crashed during the tutorial so I guess I'll have to try again this week.
6632844	6633885	Is any of our listeners playing?
6634365	6637188	Chatters, has anyone tried Lord of Ultima that came out this week?
6637248	6637568	Anybody?
6639069	6645014	Maybe we can have a guild or a kingdom or something I don't know
6645558	6645818	DarkSakura.com
6661474	6662895	We're drowning in letters.
6664076	6664676	Redertainment.
6676985	6679286	about this was Walmart's effort to create their own bank.
6679966	6684527	They wanted to lower the prices of check and credit card processing by cutting out the middleman in this process.
6684988	6690109	Walmart wanted to establish this bank in the mediocre state of Utah, which is how I came to learn about it.
6690349	6695811	Ultimately, the banking lobbies in Utah put the kibosh on this deal and the effort ultimately died.
6696411	6705494	Activision establishing their own bank assembly lowered credit card processing fees for people playing WoW and also acts as an additional revenue stream for Activision as if they need another...
6706814	6708636	I'm not saying this would be good for the consumer.
6708716	6717183	The bank of Activision would inevitably charge bank customers out the ass for bank fees, jack up interest rates on loans, and quickly foreclose on the homes of people who were delinquent on payments.
6717943	6726610	These deplorable practices would happen because Activision seems only interested in squeezing all the cash they can out of consumers and not serving their customers well like most major banks do today.
6727010	6727191	Ouch.
6728191	6729012	I'm not going to say anything.
6729052	6730053	I work in the mortgage industry.
6731283	6734105	So is there a legal reason why Activision has not established their own bank?
6734645	6740149	Or is this whole rant evidence of my low opinion of the banking industry in America and of Activision?
6740269	6741450	Stay care of entertainment.
6742030	6748554	This message is brought to you by the Burns Cafe in Taylorsville, Utah, where thanks to their choice in the meat they serve, you can literally bite an ass.
6749335	6756800	Well, it's a bummer you couldn't fit that in 140 characters or less, or the tweet might have made more sense at the time, but okay, I get your joke now, lol.
6759503	6760004	I don't know.
6760024	6761767	Activision's not going to set up a bank.
6761787	6762408	Like they care.
6762908	6765292	I get the point you're trying to make, but come on.
6768757	6769719	It's cute though.
6769739	6770740	Your email was cute.
6770780	6771501	Your thought is cute.
6771541	6771942	I like that.
6773052	6774692	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6800319	6801580	I have a suggestion for Konami.
6801600	6810228	If they're going to do poppin' music Wii V2, they should take the normal poppin' controller and have a slot in it for the Wiimote like how Activision did for Guitar Hero 3 for Wii.
6810768	6812490	I'm looking... Oh god, please.
6813170	6813871	This is just awful.
6814231	6816253	I'm looking for some fun RPGs for the 360 Help.
6817674	6822601	That's literally how it said, I am looking for fun RPGs for the 360.
6823081	6823302	Help.
6823562	6823742	Period.
6823762	6824764	Was this typed on an iPhone?
6825825	6827387	I can type better than this on an iPhone, Rob.
6827848	6830892	And besides that, iPhones, auto-capitalize and fix your spelling.
6832506	6858405	Whoever accepted my PA challenge should know that I only have SM and DDR US3 and I am looking for an online challenge on Live Sincerely DS Master 26 PS I want to find a copy of Disney Mix for PS1 and Goldeneye Clone for today's consoles I have Disney Mix, I have both of them I have the Japanese one and the US one and you can't have it
6859285	6860306	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6889565	6890206	DarkSakura.com
6910440	6913943	DS Master just not allowed to email us unless it's been spellchecked and grammarchecked.
6929147	6932050	Well, you know, Bobby's in chat and says, you know he does this on purpose, right?
6932190	6933932	The only way to stop it is to not even bother.
6934093	6934673	That's what I did.
6934693	6935895	Don't give him the attention.
6936115	6938738	That's actually what I was just about to say because I wasn't looking at you anymore.
6939258	6941461	I'm going to stop reading emails from him unless they're typed properly.
6942110	6942490	That's fair.
6943231	6947473	Yes, you need to have somebody proofread it and then we might read them.
6947693	6947913	Might.
6948954	6950875	Okay, wait, but there was a couple other points I wanted to get.
6951035	6951896	RPGs on the 360.
6951956	6955078	Final Fantasy XIII is good.
6956258	6959040	I guess a lot of people liked Infinite Discovery even though I did not.
6959220	6959680	Blue Dragon.
6960381	6960841	Blue Dragon.
6960981	6961461	Okay, whatever.
6961501	6961882	Lost Odyssey.
6961942	6962582	I liked Blue Dragon.
6962602	6963523	Lost Odyssey, yes, thank you.
6964703	6965404	Blue Dragon's okay.
6965504	6966424	I love Blue Dragon.
6966444	6967625	Play the other ones first.
6968385	6969046	Bite my butt.
6969566	6971409	Blue Dragon, actually, I will give Blue Dragon this.
6971629	6975515	If you liked the Super Nintendo RPGs, it's very retro-esque.
6976357	6978700	Blue Dragon should have just been on the Super Nintendo.
6978820	6981044	Blue Dragon reminds me of playing a Dreamcast RPG.
6981624	6982085	End of story.
6982185	6982606	I'll give you that.
6982886	6983688	It's like playing Evolution.
6984666	6986128	The other one, oh, I remember the other one.
6986828	6988169	I was like, what the hell are you smoking?
6988269	6989050	Beat and Groovy.
6989650	6990591	It's just not a good game.
6991071	6992453	Beat and Groovy was unfinished.
6992573	6998858	It's an unfinished pile of poop that Konami put on the arcade that, honestly, Microsoft should have rejected.
6999258	7001820	Like, it's a horrible abortion of a game.
7002881	7006504	It's literally, I'm not saying that, it is literally an abortion.
7007084	7008345	It was stopped...
7009546	7028477	halfway through it was actually finished and put on the marketplace you have like up to 9 star difficulties on songs that are never used there's no song on there that's harder than like a 5 star difficulty the song list is laughable there was no like download content or anything released it is a bad unfinished aborted game
7031246	7032307	Do not buy it.
7032407	7033408	I'm not even kidding.
7033508	7034608	Don't support that crap.
7055683	7056163	Thanks for watching!
7078315	7084720	So, you know, why would you bring something that's, you know, incredibly niche over here?
7084740	7086001	Just fucking fail at it.
7086241	7090425	Like, I mean, I understand wanting to bring the niche thing over here if you do a good job with it.
7090785	7093847	But that, I mean, was set up for failure from the beginning.
7093867	7096009	They can't even nail... Honestly, I'm throwing this out here.
7096229	7099892	Whoever is responsible for that game should have been fired.
7100493	7101413	Like, I'm not even kidding.
7101453	7102974	Whoever was responsible for that...
7103815	7104275	Fire Em.
7105776	7108538	That was unexcusable, that game.
7109838	7110399	Period.
7111599	7111940	Alright.
7113120	7115242	What are you giggling at over there, DarkSakura?
7115942	7117743	Are you even paying attention to the show?
7118543	7119744	I am paying attention to the show.
7119924	7124087	I just was distracted by something and I found a link to a product called HanderPants.
7125607	7126748	Underpants for your hands.
7127328	7128209	HanderPants?
7129450	7131631	Why on earth would you need HanderPants?
7132316	7133017	I don't know.
7133297	7134017	I just think it's funny.
7134037	7135598	They're called gloves.
7135618	7139280	They're fingerless gloves with the design of underwear.
7139300	7140281	I'm going to link it into the chatroom.
7140321	7140601	Pants.
7140721	7141121	Jesus.
7143743	7145224	It's in the same vein as mantis.
7146044	7149326	You go up to somebody and you're like, look at my manti pants.
7149386	7150827	Look at my hot throat pants.
7151308	7152168	I don't care.
7152869	7153569	Really, I don't.
7155290	7156311	Look at my mantis.
7158726	7160707	I am so easily distracted today Oh, it's not funny
7186854	7191019	SSJ100Matt says this topic sounds automatically better than DSMaster's email.
7191280	7191780	You know what's funny?
7191800	7193342	We didn't even finish with his email.
7193382	7197868	We just went right on to talking about mantis and I'm enjoying myself more than I was five minutes ago.
7202974	7203354	You know what?
7203434	7205235	I think that should be the rule from now on.
7207076	7207817	No, I have it.
7208237	7209758	I have a new OLR rule.
7209938	7215361	Could you please get out the stone tablets and get out the chisel because we're going to write a new rule.
7216382	7224287	When you send us a question to the mailbag and it is so horribly tight and grammar and spelling.
7224307	7228189	Look, if you make a couple mistakes here and there, I'm not the best with spelling and grammar either.
7228430	7230591	But at least if you put out an effort, we're not going to laugh at you.
7231129	7258842	at least you're consistent if you just have a horrible email that you didn't even bother to try with and you typed it like it was a text message on the cell phone we are going to answer your question with mantis.net is the website you need to go to fix your problem mantis.net or possibly handerpants when you send us a question that stinks mantis.net is where you need to go to find your answer exactly
7260092	7262114	Try the high cut ones.
7263115	7264015	Put that on the wiki.
7264056	7264976	It's an official rule.
7265657	7267799	Hey, whoever updates their wiki, add it.
7269981	7275847	Let's go to the I like game suggestion RPG 360.
7276988	7277809	Well, email her.
7277849	7280212	I think you'll find the answer at mantis.net.
7280772	7281073	Alright.
7284801	7286282	Speaking of which... These things have flies.
7286762	7290603	Let's get to... Rob, they do have embroidered briefs.
7290783	7294624	You're telling me this like I would want to suddenly go... I don't want you to get any.
7294664	7295745	I'm just saying that they're funny.
7297785	7298786	Let's get to the episode.
7314519	7314840	Lowkey.
7325201	7328444	Um, F you to bad drivers, two types in particular.
7328865	7343157	One, the person that decides, hey, you know, it's going to be a great idea to stop four car lengths before the car that's in front of them, making it near impossible to go around them, or the fact that they go really slow to accelerate once the light does change.
7344318	7349202	And then two, the more dangerous type, the people that run stop signs and run stop lights.
7350043	7357069	They're there for safety, and the fact that you just blow right through them like you don't give a shit, that's how people die.
7357349	7358650	So, stop it.
7359171	7360172	Because I don't want to die.
7363255	7367278	I'm sorry, I'm laughing too hard because I'm looking at this website.
7368158	7370299	I don't really have a lot of FUs of the week.
7370960	7372061	Actually, I had a pretty good week.
7373581	7375302	I really don't think I had a lot of bad things happen.
7375342	7378544	I guess FU to those work days that start at 6 a.m.
7378564	7381046	because getting up at 5 o'clock to go to work kind of stinks.
7381086	7384308	But at least the days go by fast, so even that's not really a complaint.
7385839	7393943	All right, let's get to some more gaming news, and then we'll open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, and who knows what phone calls we might get tonight.
7394823	7395063	Loki.
7395884	7402987	Yes, so, you know, this whole drama with Infinity Ward and Activision is just nuts.
7403747	7411750	Activision, they've hired a person to, I guess, run their community forum or whatever, Dan Amrich.
7412970	7415411	And I guess they have a Facebook, because everybody does.
7416291	7424514	And he's basically trying to give their side, I guess, of the whole bonus situation for Infinity Ward.
7425835	7429816	He says, Vince and Jason had very large bonuses.
7429876	7432797	Those bonuses are being redistributed to everyone else.
7433257	7436920	to people who did not allegedly attempt to steal company secrets.
7438462	7440864	Activision is not pocketing the bonus money.
7441164	7444588	It's still going to the people who work at Infinity Ward.
7445468	7448051	But you have to work at Infinity Ward to get it.
7449532	7454717	C. I don't want to see talented people screwed out of a paycheck any more than you do.
7457606	7460029	So are they trying to be all like, hey, we're the good guys.
7460049	7460890	We're going to pay out those bonuses.
7460910	7461871	No, we're going to pay them.
7461931	7462672	We're going to pay them.
7462712	7463073	Don't worry.
7463093	7464495	They're getting a bigger share of the bonus.
7464855	7467058	Well, why don't you pay their bonuses in the first place?
7467118	7469842	Because that was the whole problem is you weren't paying the bonuses.
7471075	7475779	What, the game's been out for almost six months now?
7476799	7478100	What's it like to get a bonus?
7478461	7481363	Isn't it time to get the bonuses out there?
7481763	7484345	I thought bonuses were just that, a bonus.
7484946	7485626	Allegedly.
7485786	7489589	Why didn't you even put that allegedly attempted to steal a company's secrets?
7490870	7491911	They're the ones that made the game.
7492371	7493973	I think all their secrets are in their head.
7494493	7495594	They don't need to steal anything.
7498271	7499033	He's just a douche.
7500375	7503361	Unfortunately, he's sub-douche to the major douche.
7505413	7506914	Why even bother having a community?
7506994	7511697	I think this is the same guy I want to say that they had, like, why do you hate Activision or whatever?
7511877	7514139	We want your honest answers or something like that.
7514359	7515019	It's like, really?
7515260	7516861	You don't know why we don't like you?
7516901	7517561	I mean, really?
7518282	7519142	You have to ask?
7520003	7521244	That's like my wife, you know?
7521324	7524566	If, like, she's mad at me and I'm like, well, what are you mad at me for?
7524626	7525567	And she's like, really?
7526027	7526867	You don't know?
7527388	7528969	That just makes me even more pissed off.
7528989	7532811	That's because we expect our spouses to be psychic when we're psychotic.
7534372	7536214	I'm letting the secret out of the bag.
7536234	7539736	Ooh, you're going to get nasty emails from the women of America?
7540316	7540956	I'm a chick!
7541957	7543478	The women of America don't listen to our show.
7544899	7547761	I can get away with saying this because it's exactly what I pull on my husband.
7548541	7550042	Wait, Dan, you didn't hear that!
7555228	7578548	It says, although it's unclear whether the remaining Infinity Ward employees have received their personal bonuses for Modern Warfare 2 yet, Activision lawsuit claims that Zampanelli and West allocated to themselves approximately one-third of the total bonus pool for the Call of Duty franchise bonuses, which included the first Modern Warfare game.
7579088	7598227	Further, it contends that Wes and Zampella were demanding an even larger share of the bonus pool for Modern Warfare 2 Oh, so now we're saying that they're getting too much of a bonus or whatever, that they wanted too much of a bonus Well, that's too bad that they got fired, so that really doesn't make any sense
7602036	7627197	uh and no word on when this whole thing is going to be taken care of but they're thinking that more people are going to leave so uh oh and they have a big old quote for Activision's counter suit which I don't really feel like reading because it's just a bunch of crap in my opinion ipso facto sue money
7629239	7630419	Let's move on then, shall we?
7631280	7634482	One more story for you guys, and then I guess we'll open up the Skype line and see what happens.
7634542	7636883	Could be a fun time tonight.
7636903	7651992	877-GAME-OLR I forgot to mention, real quick, this kind of goes along with the story, but it is apparently rumored, or I don't know if it's confirmed or rumored, but they're saying that three Modern Warfare 2 games are going to be out by 2011.
7653653	7661524	or three, not Modern Warfare three Call of Duty games will be out good luck guys good luck
7662116	7663877	Well, these other games might be out soon.
7663937	7665359	It's more website leaks.
7665439	7671844	Remember earlier in the show we had news about Farmville and some apparent websites that were being registered that gave away Farmville on other platforms.
7671864	7676787	Well, something similar is kind of happening, but it has to do with some different games, like games that people actually play.
7677448	7678369	Here's the interesting thing.
7678569	7686735	The URLs were registered for BloodstoneGame.com, was registered Wednesday, and of course Bloodstone is supposed to be the next Bond game.
7686755	7688096	That's like the rumors that's coming out.
7688416	7689878	But you know what also was registered?
7689898	7690418	Bloodstone.
7690418	7691820	and GoldeneyeGame.com.
7691860	7701150	Could this be, I don't know, something where, you know, there was rumors before there might be a Wii version of Goldeneye coming out or something.
7701610	7702411	Who knows?
7703352	7707156	Which is strange because I could have sworn they said before, it's not fucking happening.
7707256	7707657	Shut up.
7708752	7710472	But you know, where there's a will, there's a way.
7711033	7718335	Also, apparently, a game that was discovered, DriverSanFranciscoGame.com was registered by Ubisoft.
7720755	7721776	It's by Ubisoft?
7721896	7722756	Yeah, I don't know.
7722776	7725637	Well, but didn't Atari sell it off?
7725857	7727057	Yeah, that's right.
7727177	7727817	So there you go.
7727837	7728658	That's too bad.
7728798	7734199	AssassinsCreedBrotherhood.com and LaserHomeBattleground.com What the hell is that?
7734259	7735500	Laser Home Battleground?
7735720	7736760	Sounds like laser tag.
7738365	7740606	Where's LaserCatsBattleground.com?
7740646	7741186	That's the game.
7741226	7743687	I would have given that top of the news reporting.
7743947	7744627	Oh, that's easy.
7744647	7748688	You just put a cat stuffed animal on top of the laser gun.
7749848	7750969	Alright.
7751089	7755890	Supposedly, Assassin's Creed is going to have another sequel in 2011 anyway, so maybe that's the subtitle of the game.
7755930	7757431	Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.
7757511	7757871	Who knows?
7758691	7759211	Brotherhood?
7760132	7760292	Yeah.
7762032	7768114	Assassin'sCreedBrotherhood.com Sounds like another PSP game.
7768792	7769573	That could be too.
7769693	7769993	Who knows?
7770013	7771875	I'm going to the website right now and it times out.
7772015	7773456	I guess you have to look up the registry info.
7773937	7776199	There's no forwarding happening just yet.
7777801	7778461	All right, guys.
7778501	7782505	This is part of the show where we're going to open up the Skype line and take your calls.
7782525	7785908	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
7785928	7787730	If you're going to call us on Skype, that's great.
7787770	7791614	The quality is really good on Skype, but we do encourage you to call Echo123 on Skype.
7793315	7799640	or I think in the newer versions of Skype you click a button that says test call or something and you can test your configuration first.
7799700	7803943	I really urge you to do that or I'm going to make fun of you when your call stinks.
7804363	7807305	Alright, Orange Sausage Radio is the place to call on Skype.
7807986	7813129	Whatever you want to talk about tonight's show, go ahead, say your piece, have a voice.
7814010	7820995	While we wait for calls because it takes about a minute for me to say something and the listeners actually hear it with the encoding and everything, Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us?
7821741	7827604	Yes, apparently there is a new game coming out from Bayer, I guess.
7828465	7839031	It's called Knock Em Down's World's Fair, and apparently it's a device that, or it comes with a device that you use to check your blood glucose level, and you can play the game that way.
7839511	7844372	That's funny, that's one of the other Tiger Claw stories from the Twitter, but he sent so many I had to pick and choose.
7844892	7845752	It's funny you brought it up too.
7846473	7849113	I thought I remembered hearing that this game was in development before.
7849193	7854094	Like I wanted to say some time ago, I heard that there was a DS game in development that was using medical stuff.
7854735	7857775	Yeah, I can't imagine though this would be too popular.
7857795	7860736	I mean, it seems like a very narrow market that they'd be, you know...
7861300	7863122	Well, yes, you're right.
7863362	7871649	But, I mean, for that market, I think it could actually be really cool because, you know, there's a lot of tweens and teenagers that get diagnosed with diabetes at a very young age.
7872169	7878135	And this could be an interesting way to teach them kind of the management of that because, you know, you have to alter your diet, take your blood glucose, know what it means.
7878435	7879596	You know, there's a lot that goes with it.
7879636	7881437	It's not just like, hey, you have diabetes.
7882298	7883639	You know, there's a lot of things that go with it.
7884000	7888323	So I actually think even though, yeah, you're right, it's a niche thing, it's kind of neat.
7888904	7889024	It is.
7890359	7893080	I'm sure it will sell the particular products.
7895100	7896520	Monitors and stuff are what?
7896720	7898661	$200 a pop and then you have to buy test strips?
7899861	7904562	I know your insurance usually covers that stuff, but you still have some choices on what brands you get.
7904942	7906362	It's still pretty crazy.
7906402	7908662	I have a number of friends who have to monitor.
7909462	7911563	Especially if you're the type 1.
7913323	7914643	Yeah, there's different stages of it.
7915304	7917784	Sometimes you can be diabetic, but you don't actually have to test anything.
7918562	7921963	You still have to watch it, or I guess you could slip into one of the other types.
7922264	7926665	Yeah, well, typically adult onset, I believe that's type 2.
7927506	7931507	Yeah, my grandma had it, so it was unfortunate.
7932468	7938190	I don't know why, you know what, I upgraded the version of Skype, so I'm almost worried that the calls aren't coming through, so I'm just going to make sure.
7938210	7939190	Well, Bobby's call came through.
7939210	7942011	Yeah, that's true, Bobby's call came through, so that should work.
7942491	7944852	I'm just calling the 877 number to make sure everything's okay.
7945493	7946273	Where are you people?
7946966	7947706	I know, it's kind of weird.
7947727	7948867	We're not getting any calls tonight.
7949007	7950568	Usually it's flooded with people.
7950988	7954290	I guess they're worried about the threats of sending people to mantis.net.
7954330	7954671	I don't know.
7956192	7957472	Well, I got some more Last Minute Stories.
7957552	7958233	Alright, let's hear it.
7959240	7983368	MacWarrior 4 there was that whole kind of delay they were going to release the game free to play over the web and it was being held up by Microsoft now it's finally been cleared so there will be coming or coming soon there will be a brand new port of MacWarrior 4 that you'll be able to play for free over the internet through a web browser isn't that exciting
7986286	8007641	Mad Catz is apparently now going to be making all the principal peripherals for Rock Band basically that means all the peripherals that come with say Rock Band 3 or any future releases going forth will be made by Mad Catz and not by EA or whoever the hell they had making their peripherals
8008301	8014306	and yeah, I know Mad Catz, Purples at one time really sucked but to be honest, I kind of like their guitar at least.
8014646	8017248	I have the bass and I dig that.
8017268	8018269	It's pretty cool.
8018289	8023893	It doesn't wear out like the fucking rock band, just regular guitar they have.
8023953	8024434	Guess what?
8024474	8025154	We got a call.
8025434	8026195	Awesome.
8026495	8027556	Hi, you're on Orange Dance Radio.
8027576	8027936	Who's this?
8029257	8030639	Hi, this is Amiga 777.
8030779	8030979	Amiga 777.
8031099	8032240	I love the Amiga.
8032260	8032740	What's up?
8036340	8040323	I'm just testing the streams to make sure that the calls are going through for you.
8040704	8042485	So that's pretty much it.
8043546	8045427	A-okay works great.
8046048	8046989	Perfect.
8047009	8047529	There you go.
8047589	8048910	Wait, wait, wait.
8052013	8052533	Ah, yes.
8053434	8055055	Just confirm me it's not your stream.
8055115	8056136	We just don't want to talk to you.
8056156	8057937	This is just a courtesy call.
8058878	8059639	Just checking.
8060299	8060740	That's right.
8060760	8061760	Everything's fine, guys.
8062521	8063121	No worries.
8063282	8063682	You're good.
8067561	8068322	Oh, that's funny.
8069984	8070844	Oh, right, whatever.
8072046	8073167	Here's someone that we haven't heard from.
8073187	8075349	That's one of my favorite phone calls I've ever got, just so you know.
8075649	8075969	All right.
8076290	8078151	Here's someone we haven't heard from in a while.
8078452	8080093	Actually, two years to be exact.
8080854	8086199	Surfer Girl is back with a new rumor regarding the slim Xbox 360.
8086639	8088581	She says it's going to be unveiled at E3.
8088941	8091003	They're going to rebrand the Xbox 360 as well.
8093385	8104989	Um, apparently the, uh, review will happen during, or the Slim 360 Natal bundle will happen at one of the two, yes, two press conferences at this year's E3.
8105409	8112671	What's more is the 360 will be getting a subtle rebrand with a new logo and black as the new primary color for the console.
8113011	8118833	They feel that the new system needs to be black because, um, a white Natal wouldn't sit well against the typical, um,
8119373	8120534	and Gloss Black TV.
8120974	8122696	The new system design is pretty neat.
8123136	8129041	And Natal, let's just say you're going to be very surprised and very pleased by one of the games being revealed.
8129401	8129821	What is it?
8130662	8135906	And then, of course, in bold, it says, might get shot or MGS.
8136166	8138888	So perhaps a new Metal Gear Solid game.
8139448	8141190	All right, let's go to the phones.
8141350	8142751	And we have another test call coming in.
8142791	8143752	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8143772	8144192	Who's this?
8145233	8145493	Hey.
8150407	8151768	Hello?
8152909	8154290	Hey, DT, what's on your mind?
8155371	8155912	Hi, you're here.
8155932	8160876	You got to turn down the speakers on the computer because then you get all confused.
8160896	8161257	Yeah, I know.
8161997	8162498	So what's up?
8162518	8163278	What's on your mind, buddy?
8165400	8170325	Just plugging the, I know it's a month late, but plugging the WonderCon article.
8171058	8172339	That's right, WonderCon.
8172359	8176461	You got to go to WonderCon a couple weeks ago, and you wrote a whole nice little article about it that's on the website.
8177742	8178383	That's cool.
8178443	8180664	How did you enjoy things at WonderCon?
8180724	8181905	Did you have a good time overall?
8183326	8184406	Oh, God, yeah.
8185027	8187428	First stop was at a Capcom booth.
8187448	8193392	They were showing Final Fight and Super Street Fighter 4 and Plus Planet 2, actually.
8194032	8199315	You know, I actually read the article, believe it or not, and I heard you scored a soundtrack at the booth.
8199355	8200036	What did you get there?
8201974	8203435	Actually, that was just posted online.
8203455	8205995	What I got was a couple... Oh, no, wait, no, yeah, no, you're right.
8206035	8208956	I bought the Mega... the Rockman 9 soundtrack.
8210457	8210817	Nice.
8210977	8213418	I like how you call it Rockman 9 and not Mega Man 9.
8214138	8215539	Was it actually the Japanese version?
8216659	8217179	Yeah, it was.
8217379	8217960	Oh, that's cool.
8218640	8219100	Very cool.
8219818	8220258	No hints.
8220718	8223900	It's interesting, though, that you were at... Now, see, this kind of blows me away.
8224000	8228882	Like, even though, you know, I know it was a few weeks ago you went to WonderCon at this point, so for some people they're like, okay, old news.
8229323	8246011	This does strike me as interesting, is that Capcom had to know that Marvel vs. Capcom 3 was happening when they did WonderCon, but yet they didn't say anything at what you would otherwise think is like a really freaking logical place to announce a game like Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
8247011	8248332	And yet, not a peep, right?
8248352	8248432	Yeah.
8250993	8255415	I know they talked about being at future Comic Cons and whatnot with that.
8256796	8258436	I guess WonderCon just wasn't good enough.
8258496	8259137	Sad cry.
8259797	8260057	Upset.
8260077	8260577	Yeah.
8260878	8261278	I know.
8262358	8266620	But hey, there's BayCon coming up, I think is a big sci-fi nerdy con.
8266640	8270362	I don't know if there will be a lot of video games with that, but I know I had some friends talking about that Memorial Day weekend.
8270382	8271282	And of course, Fanime.
8272103	8275084	Memorial Day weekend is always a big con weekend, so there's a lot of that coming up.
8276165	8278646	Any cons in your future otherwise, DarkTetsuya?
8278666	8278766	Yeah.
8280578	8281078	I don't know.
8281518	8283760	Probably just trying to go to Wendicon next year.
8283800	8286442	I know my brother was excited about that.
8286462	8288524	He's really digging the comics.
8289264	8289785	That's cool.
8289825	8290905	You've got to go to Comic-Con.
8290925	8293788	I've heard the one that happens in San Diego is epic.
8293928	8297070	I would love to go someday, but I just don't know if I'm going to get this year.
8297090	8297871	I heard it's already sold out.
8298491	8298691	Is it?
8298991	8299852	It wouldn't surprise me at all.
8300172	8301393	With all the stars and everything to go.
8301874	8303535	I'll have to plan for 2011 or something.
8304335	8304576	All right.
8304776	8307598	Well, Dr. Tsui, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?
8309625	8311686	Well, oh wait, yeah, no, I know.
8314007	8318309	I heard some footage got stolen at the Super Street Fighter 4 launch event.
8318529	8319770	I don't know if you talked about that.
8320750	8321270	We didn't.
8321310	8322131	What did you hear about this?
8322171	8324252	Like, I vaguely remember seeing an article on this.
8324332	8324992	What's up?
8325032	8325512	What's going on?
8327113	8327413	I don't know.
8327453	8335437	I guess someone stole a bunch of stuff at the Super Street Fighter launch event, like footage of the different players and all of that, and a MacBook.
8339863	8343085	I don't get what the advantage would be to stealing something like that.
8343285	8345406	The game is pretty much out now.
8345646	8347607	They didn't steal anything regarding the game.
8347627	8352230	They stole camera equipment and SD memory cards and a MacBook.
8352370	8354392	It was that they wanted the computer equipment.
8354432	8356313	It wasn't anything to do with what was on it.
8356433	8357994	It was IM8 bit.
8358434	8360015	That's stinky.
8360996	8363077	How did a thief get into an event like that?
8363507	8364948	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8389448	8390129	Yeah, no problem.
8407129	8427772	the fine dark tit CEO who really tries to actually put content on orangeontrader.com nice guy TigerClaw says they don't care about the equipment all they care about is getting the footage TigerClaw says they recorded footage of the event yeah they just want the footage back it's just messed up thieves suck alright what else you got Loki anything else
8429013	8456723	just some last minute stuff here there's another little big or I guess a little big planet PSP download content pack that's going to be coming out called the Turbo Pack and it's going to feature some new stock car racing inspired tracks and vehicles and also they're going to have I guess some construction based vehicles as well they're going to be available such as forklifts, cranes, and cement mixers so that's kind of neat
8458143	8466508	Unbound Saga, which was a comic-based beat-em-up game that was on the PSP, is now making its way to Xbox Live Arcade.
8466528	8468610	It's kind of a little bit like Comic Zone, I guess.
8470231	8472972	PSP one is alright, I guess.
8473112	8475374	But that will be coming out a little bit later on this year.
8477055	8485201	Um... Asia is getting a limited edition Final Fantasy XIII controller with the silk screen of lightning on it.
8485301	8490065	I guess to go with your, you know, Final Fantasy XIII lightning PS3.
8490345	8494048	Why that wasn't included with the PS3 is beyond me, but... A little late.
8494368	8494989	Oh, whatever.
8495169	8497171	I guess, you know, opportunity to sell it twice.
8498031	8499112	And then, um...
8500433	8506420	Lastly, just a little bit of elaboration on a story we had earlier talking about delays from Nintendo.
8506460	8508442	Kind of as I thought, different things.
8509423	8515510	It's taken a little bit longer to get the development for Metroid Other M done because they're working with a third-party company on it.
8516451	8518534	That's why it's been delayed to August 31st.
8519855	8531692	and then of course Sin and Punishment Star Successor is just basically a fill of space because it was originally going to come out at the beginning of the month and they did their excuses well we just want you to have some more time to play Super Mario Galaxy 2 so
8534301	8534901	That is it.
8535662	8536062	All right.
8537043	8539004	Well, I don't know what's up.
8539124	8540105	Something's in the water.
8540625	8541606	Come on, people.
8541746	8543086	Ronchan, call us.
8543167	8544207	No, I closed Skype.
8545008	8545568	One last thing.
8545608	8546248	I forgot.
8546689	8548130	This might be the next Yaris.
8548510	8554153	Apparently, Audi is releasing a free rhythm-based driving game for the iPhone.
8555554	8556055	Oh, goody.
8557315	8558156	No more to say there.
8559752	8576108	Alright, well, I don't know, I guess, you know, it's okay, some weeks, you know, in all things considered, it was a bit of a slow news week of sorts, you know, a lot of the stories we had tonight weren't like huge things, I mean, a lot of stories were confirmations of things that were spoiled last week, and you know, so I guess It really does, but where's the love?
8576649	8578030	That's alright Where's the love?
8578070	8578611	That's alright
8579011	8583192	I could use the extra time tonight to take care of some things before work tomorrow, so I'm sure we all could.
8583973	8585853	I think we're going to wrap it up, believe it or not.
8585873	8588314	A little bit of a shorter show tonight, but that's okay.
8588354	8591655	Again, it just wasn't a huge, huge week for news.
8592696	8593876	It was like a bunch of Capcom news.
8593916	8594816	Like, eh, we already knew that.
8594956	8595657	Yeah, we already heard.
8596057	8596597	Been there, done that.
8597217	8613407	of course you know it's going to be like this for a few weeks because E3 is on the horizon so outside of your E3 leaks May is going to be a bit of a slow month so if I'd known we would have planned a game or something for tonight so you know what that means next week if it's a slow news week again we're going to have a game or something
8613727	8616970	Actually, or we might have an actual guest on the show.
8617270	8619092	I know my friend Matt is dying to come back.
8619352	8623356	He was here back when the show was still at my house, and he's like, I really want to come back and hang with you guys.
8623376	8623816	I'm like, okay.
8624236	8627099	And then I'm sure Alan will be here in the next couple weeks.
8627179	8631162	He's loving coming to the show, so we'll have him at some point.
8632303	8634385	BlackWolfInChat says, okay, so let me get this straight.
8634786	8638189	Rama calls my show for the first time ever, but doesn't call OLR.
8640600	8641321	It's a weird night.
8641401	8641882	It's okay.
8642202	8643003	No, I closed Skype.
8643123	8644324	I'm sorry, guys.
8644364	8645165	The moment's passed.
8647127	8648469	The opportunity has passed.
8648529	8648989	That's okay.
8649430	8650371	I won't take it personally.
8652713	8654596	He's just going to have a big diva stop.
8655717	8655957	All right.
8656518	8657479	No, but send us some emails.
8657539	8660722	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and all that fun stuff.
8661463	8666926	And see, I would love to just do a game, pull a game out of the hat, but we don't have anything.
8667207	8667887	That's okay, guys.
8667927	8668467	No, seriously.
8668567	8672290	I could stand to wrap up the show by 9 o'clock and then go home and take care of some other stuff.
8672810	8675492	So, we are out, you guys.
8675992	8676472	Let's go around.
8676512	8677113	You know what you could do?
8677353	8677533	What?
8677673	8679234	You should play the clip of Julian again.
8679972	8682133	I will play the clip of Julian again because you know what?
8682193	8687737	No phone call that we're even going to get could possibly match how disgustingly cute Julian is in that clip.
8688117	8689038	So let's hear it.
8689118	8689798	He's a cute kid.
8690038	8690959	He's a very cute kid.
8691039	8696042	I'm telling you, this is going to be all the rage at youtube.com slash users slash DarkSakuraOLR.
8699825	8700805	Dalek.
8701466	8702606	What does a Dalek say?
8704528	8705068	Dalek.
8707711	8712636	Exterminate Exterminate Exterminate Exterminate Exterminate Exterminate Exterminate
8732762	8733122	Did you?
8733142	8734043	No, I didn't really.
8734183	8734783	Not me.
8735744	8739486	Keep in mind, I was watching PBS a lot when I was a kid.
8740627	8742508	So, Doctor Who came on PBS.
8743509	8744610	So, I started with like...
8746463	8748583	4th Doctor Sarah Jane era.
8749624	8752724	So she's always going to be my favorite because she's who I remember.
8753384	8757585	Mace Atsuma in chat says, Julian is smarter than DS Master.
8757625	8758345	Confirms.
8759666	8762366	Julian is smarter than most adults I know.
8762966	8763586	That's mean.
8763646	8764147	I know.
8764287	8764907	I'm serious.
8765107	8766267	He's a smart kid.
8767227	8768527	And he's a bit of a smartass too.
8769208	8769928	Just like his parents.
8770128	8770788	A little bit sassy?
8771528	8772929	Square One TV Home Room
8795816	8796917	They didn't play it at school.
8797197	8800601	No, we had Channel One or something.
8801702	8808348	They would pipe this pay cable show into our homerooms every morning and try to edumacate us.
8809930	8810790	I just did my homework.
8810971	8817957	The only show I remember watching on an early morning TV thing at school was Kids Court with Paul Provanza.
8819018	8819899	I found happy tape.
8839682	8847492	My final thought is I see some yarn over on DarkSakura's bookshelf and it makes me think, I wish I was a cat so I could just play with that yarn all day.
8847973	8850095	Yeah, this is the scarf of yours I still need to finish.
8850456	8854101	You need to see the scarf I got yesterday at a thrift store for a dollar.
8854481	8855523	Yes, awesome.
8855983	8856384	You were...
8857341	8859502	I was like a flaming gay fourth doctor.
8859562	8860162	I really was.
8861022	8861942	It was very short.
8862182	8862722	All right.
8862742	8865983	Well, because it was for a 12-year-old girl and I bought it at thrift store to wear to Rocky.
8866463	8868524	Anyhow, but that's neither here nor there.
8868924	8871004	Loki, your final thought tonight.
8871565	8872925	I want to play more Just Cause 2.
8873285	8880827	Hopefully this time the textures actually show up so that I can see what I'm doing because it's kind of hard when the whole map is see-through or most of the map is see-through.
8882267	8888531	Thank you guys so much for downloading our show, listening to it live, supporting independent podcasting.
8888551	8889571	You guys are awesome.
8889591	8897856	I know I say that week after week, but if you think about it, next week is episode 365 of our show.
8897916	8900558	That's one for every day of the year.
8901358	8909843	And that's a whole long time, and we just wouldn't have made it this long if it wasn't for the support of you guys just being here every week and saying, you guys are funny.
8911885	8912765	Thank you guys so much.
8912825	8920330	All we ask, if you enjoyed Orange Lounge Radio, just tell a friend or two or five about Orange Lounge Radio and what we do here.
8920350	8921190	Just help us spread the word.
8921210	8922251	That's really all we ask.
8922331	8925713	Many of you have shared your tweets and Facebook messages about how you've done that.
8925733	8931617	Trust me, we really do appreciate it because we don't have money to take out advertising or whatever.
8931937	8933037	I've never asked to be on a show.
8933057	8933837	I'm not surprised.
8956943	8959924	Look, you were on, like, All Games Interactive a couple times, I think.
8960605	8961725	Didn't you do a couple calls with them?
8961745	8962666	I did a toss-over.
8962746	8963446	There you go.
8963486	8964887	All right.
8965087	8973811	Actually, actually, and I do also want to say, given that graduation thing, by the way, it's Mar and Marvel, our own tiara.
8975332	8976372	Congratulations in two months.
8976873	8977333	Absolutely.
8977373	8977773	Graduating.
8977853	8978413	What's the major?
8979154	8979654	Graphic design.
8980134	8980414	Fun.
8981035	8981475	Good stuff.
8981815	8982956	Hopefully she'll be back on the show.
8983036	8985377	Hopefully she'll be taking a graduation gift trip out here.
8986138	8988720	But Loki, poor Loki, who has not been on any show.
8989020	8990941	Somebody needs to email Loki and get him on a show.
8990961	8991481	That's all right.
8991682	8991922	All right.
8993303	8993703	Doesn't matter.
8994583	8994864	All right.
8996204	8996425	Let's see.
8997065	9000187	Amiga777 in chat says, I nominate Tommy T to be a guest.
9000267	9001928	I'm assuming he means Tommy Tallarico.
9002248	9004470	We had him on a couple of years ago.
9005911	9007812	It was right before the video game's live CD came out.
9008052	9008473	Thanks for watching!
9020748	9021368	Alright, that's it.
9021408	9021729	We're done.
9021749	9022289	We're wrapping up.
9022309	9022889	We're out of here.
9022949	9025151	Thank you guys so much again for your support.
9025591	9027192	And what do you say we do it all again next week?
9027252	9027732	Sound good?
9028172	9030594	And no, it is not episode live 365.
9030634	9033055	I got nothing going on next week, sure.
9033455	9034276	We don't speak about that.
9034296	9035517	Are they even around still?
9035857	9036477	I believe so.
9038138	9040820	But they don't look any different than they did about four years ago when we left.
9041240	9041720	Alright, that's it.
9041740	9042060	We're done.
9042121	9042341	Bye.
9042361	9042641	Good night.
