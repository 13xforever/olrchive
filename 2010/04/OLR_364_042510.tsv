7000	13000	Here's your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and the Low Crew
14000	19000	Tonight at the 25th of 2010, could a new TV station come to an Xbox near you?
19000	25000	Some big Wii titles get delayed, and a Capcom press event confirms all that was spoiled last week
25000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	39000	Hello my friends all across the internet and welcome to another episode, episode 364 of Orange Lounge Radio
39000	43000	It's the video game program where every gamer has a voice
43000	50000	Pull up a chair and join us and chat, chat.orangeloungeradio.com as we tape live on this lovely Sunday evening
50000	58000	April the 25th of 2010, right after Bobby Blackwolf has finished his show at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com
58000	61000	My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours
61000	65000	Say hello as well to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers
65000	66000	Grapes
66000	67000	How are you doing?
67000	68000	Grapes
68000	69000	Full of grapes?
69000	70000	Muscat grapes
70000	71000	Did they taste grape?
74000	78000	Oh, we got three hours full of puns for you guys, I bet you can't wait
78000	79000	I heard worse over the weekend
79000	82000	Alright, and Loki, Techmaster Loki's in the house
82000	83000	Yes I am
83000	84000	How are you doing?
84000	85000	I'm doing okay
85000	92000	Now, Techmaster Loki, brought to the show with him tonight from KFC, Double Down number 2
93000	96000	Yes, this time without the horrible cheese sauce
96000	100000	And it still had kind of that little taste of the cheese sauce on there but
102000	105000	It was alright, it was definitely edible this time
105000	111000	And I just have to say it's kind of just average, really for the cost you're better off getting pretty much anything else
112000	118000	Even stuff from KFC, because I mean Double Down's like a good, I think $6.99 or something
119000	122000	I mean, hell, you can get a lot more chicken for that
122000	123000	Just get a chicken wing
123000	124000	Or just get wings
124000	125000	Just get a chicken wing
125000	126000	Just keep it old school
126000	130000	Barbeque wings or something like that, that's really where it's at, it's good stuff
130000	135000	Don't need the rest of the Double Down, it's just really just an excuse to sell expensive chicken
135000	136000	That's all it really is
138000	140000	But yeah, tried it with extra bacon even
140000	142000	And just, it's kind of okay
142000	144000	Even extra bacon didn't make it better?
144000	146000	Didn't really make it that, didn't make a difference really
146000	150000	Because it was just too much of the white meat chicken flavor
151000	155000	Alright, going to our chat room at chat.orangelandre.com
155000	157000	You know we call them the always present fourth guest on the show
157000	159000	Because we don't have any special guests tonight
159000	162000	We haven't had a lot of special guests at Studio Dark Soccer, I don't know what it is
162000	165000	The people I invented to were outside in the front yard racing RC cars
165000	166000	Or they were
166000	167000	Is that what they're really doing?
167000	168000	Yes
168000	169000	That's funny
169000	170000	And chasing
170000	172000	I only saw the girls across the street in the Barbie car
172000	174000	That I almost ran over
174000	177000	That was while, when you were just here and sitting here wondering what to do
177000	178000	Yes
178000	181000	They were outside actually chasing the dog with the RC cars
181000	183000	Will's dog won too
183000	184000	I see
184000	189000	And just to bring some light to what Dark Soccer said while you were sitting here wondering what to do
189000	192000	Usually I get to the show about an hour early, right?
192000	195000	I get here to the show because you know I want to set everything up
195000	199000	Get the mixing board, the mics, the chairs, the computer
199000	203000	Make sure we're ready for Bobby's call because he actually calls us about 5.45, 5.50
203000	205000	You know make sure everything's good to go
205000	207000	So that we're ready for showtime
207000	211000	But tonight I arrived and Dark Soccer had been proactive tonight
211000	214000	She had already set up the mixing board, plugged it in, had the mics
214000	216000	Everything was ready to go, I just had to turn on the computer
216000	218000	Except for Loki's mic because you forgot
218000	221000	Well that was my fault but that's neither here nor there
221000	223000	And I had gifts
223000	227000	Yes and she even gave me, what is this, like sweet beer or something, soda beer
227000	229000	Shandy, it's a Shandy Bass
229000	231000	Dark Soccer's trying to get me drunk
231000	232000	It's beer soda
232000	233000	I don't know why she's trying to get me drunk
233000	237000	It's a little too sweet overall but it's really good because it tastes just like
237000	241000	It's basically like a lemon soda with a little bit of beer in it
241000	245000	Alright, I know we usually start off the show talking about our gaming weeks
245000	248000	But there's some actually really funny personal things I think we have to talk about
248000	251000	And Dark Soccer, this cracked me up
251000	254000	Something that you have recently added to YouTube
254000	259000	Give us some background on what's going on here and what happened this past week
259000	265000	Well, I went to my friend Becky's son's third birthday party
265000	268000	Well okay, first of all, first of all that morning I went to a bar mitzvah
268000	271000	I hadn't eaten anything so I won't even go into that
271000	273000	So I went to Becky's son's birthday party
273000	276000	And he was really cute and he was wearing like the best shirt ever
276000	278000	Which was a t-shirt with a Dalek on it
278000	282000	So I actually managed to get some commentary from him
282000	285000	And I love this YouTube more than anything
285000	286000	What?
286000	292000	The first thing it got cut off is I asked him what was on his shirt
292000	296000	Oh okay, so, hey kid, what is on your shirt?
296000	299000	Dalek
299000	301000	What does a Dalek say?
301000	304000	It's a serendipity
304000	312000	And my immediate reaction was, Dark Soccer, what are you teaching the children?
312000	313000	I didn't teach him that
313000	315000	It wasn't me, I didn't do it
315000	322000	It was either his mother or his aunt or some relative along that vein
322000	326000	And if you want the chat room shouting link, link
326000	328000	But I want to give this out so that everybody has it
328000	330000	It's just on Dark Soccer's personal YouTube which you've given up
330000	331000	Dark Soccer O-L-R
331000	336000	Yeah, just YouTube, what, YouTube.com slash user slash Dark Soccer O-L-R
336000	337000	One word
337000	338000	So there you go, exterminate
338000	340000	Play it again, play it again, play it again
340000	341000	One more time, one more time
341000	347000	Exterminate
347000	349000	It's not as scary when he says it
349000	353000	It's really not
353000	355000	I also like how you said Dalek
355000	356000	Alright
356000	357000	Dalek
357000	361000	I hope you had fun, that's going to be the next David goes to the dentist video right there
361000	364000	Exterminate
364000	366000	Alright we have breaking
366000	372000	Becky, because I'm chatting with Becky, she said that he watched Doctor Who with them and seen a Dalek episode
372000	373000	I see
373000	374000	So he knows what a Dalek is
374000	382000	Alright, well we got some other breaking news, live unfolding, breaking news here at the O-L-R studio headquarters
388000	393000	We go live over to Tech Master Loki with the special report here
393000	396000	What is going on, this is unfolding live actually, literally
396000	401000	One minute before we went live tonight, we've found something out, what is going on, Loki?
401000	405000	Apparently one of Jamie's friends messaged me on Facebook
405000	409000	By the name TJ McKimy
409000	414000	And posted a link to a Stockton Craigslist entry
414000	418000	Guess whose number happens up here, right there
418000	421000	Oh, the guy that stole my 360 a while back
421000	424000	Off loady, PS3 now
424000	425000	And your money
425000	427000	Yes, and my money
427000	432000	So the guy who hack soared your 360 for real and just ran off with it and never
432000	436000	And if you didn't hear the show about a month ago, long story short, you went out to meet the guy
436000	443000	And he was going to do the J-Tag thing on your 360 so you could play as Baluta and all that stuff and no more heroes and stuff, right?
443000	447000	So he was going to do that to your 360 and he said, you know, come back in a couple hours
447000	452000	Which should have been your hint right there, Loki, but you know, you don't know until it happens
452000	458000	And so Loki tried to go back and yeah, the guy ran off with his 360
458000	463000	And that's why a super nice listener in Austin, we suspect, based on where the package came from
463000	465000	Apparently sent Loki a new one
465000	470000	So you think we'd be over this by now, but thanks to Super Sleuth TJ on Facebook
470000	474000	Apparently this guy is at it again on Craigslist
474000	475000	Oh yeah
475000	476000	I think I want to nail him
476000	480000	I know, and the chatters are going, call him, call him live on air
480000	484000	I am not radio professionally
484000	487000	I think there's an issue with doing that when you don't have the person's permission
487000	493000	I realize he's the bad guy, but I worry it would turn into one of those things where the thief falls through the roof
493000	498000	And then sues the owners of the home for the fact that he broke his foot trying to break into the house
498000	499000	You know what I mean?
499000	503000	So I can't do anything about it
503000	507000	But
507000	509000	As we look to the person who can do something about it
509000	511000	Or, well, I'm just saying
511000	515000	I don't want to drive down the Stockton again, I mean, it's Stockton, it's just, it's awful
515000	519000	You have, you have, we, hey, we don't write the news, we just report it
519000	521000	I say just call Stockton PD and
521000	524000	It would be funny, but, I mean, what are they going to do?
524000	527000	They're going to be like, well, it's our word versus yours
527000	531000	Uh, yeah, I was trying to illegally hack my 360
531000	534000	Well, not even, it doesn't even matter if that was the case
534000	538000	I was having solder work done on my, you know, 360s motherboard
538000	542000	Alright, and Bobby in chat, you know, because he knows more about radio than I do
542000	545000	So that's a, it depends on the states guy
545000	547000	Some states only need one side's permission
547000	551000	You know, again, it's just one of those things where it's like, you know what, it's
551000	552000	What about calling Disneyland?
552000	553000	I don't think it would be good
553000	556000	Remember when they called Disneyland?
556000	558000	That was harmless, that was funny
558000	559000	This will be funny too
559000	560000	And then the call got disconnected right in the middle
560000	563000	Dark Saga is referring to an old ass episode
563000	565000	A ten year old episode of Understation Live
565000	566000	That was great
566000	568000	Where we called the pay phone at Disneyland
568000	569000	That's how you know it's old
569000	571000	Because, are there even pay phones at Disneyland anymore?
571000	572000	I know, right
572000	575000	We called the pay phone at Disneyland and started having a conversation with some guy
575000	577000	And like right in the middle of it, the call just dropped
577000	579000	And we're like, oh shit, the Disneyland mafia
579000	583000	Just like tapped into the conversation and just terminated the call right there
583000	585000	Exterminate!
585000	586000	Alright
586000	590000	And then, oh apparently now, on top of everything else
590000	592000	Chatters are saying the stream is down
592000	593000	See?
593000	594000	Something is going
594000	595000	No, we're back
595000	597000	I know it's back, I'm looking at the little broadcasty thingy
597000	599000	And it says it's still sending data over
599000	601000	Well we still gotta tape the show
601000	603000	Because remember, I know live listeners
603000	605000	We love you guys, but we love the podcasters too
605000	608000	And the podcast people, they don't get the stream downtime
608000	611000	So we just gotta keep on rolling
611000	613000	I don't know what happened there, that's very odd
613000	616000	Xbox guys hacking our network too
616000	619000	Alright, let's get around ten minutes into the show finally
619000	621000	And we can finally talk about our gaming week
621000	623000	Stark Soccer, how was your gaming week?
623000	625000	It was not
625000	628000	Oh yeah, I started playing Babylonian Twins
628000	631000	Now that I finally have gotten my project out of the way
631000	632000	And had a chance to play something
632000	634000	It's really fun, oh my god it's really fun
634000	637000	But it's definitely, it's like a puzzle adventure game
637000	641000	It really is, because like you do one thing with one brother
641000	644000	And then the other one is a statue
644000	648000	So you actually can use him, when one's a statue
648000	652000	You can jump off of him and put him on buttons and levers and things
652000	655000	So it's just, it's really, really fun
655000	658000	This is the best way I can say it, it's just really fun
658000	661000	And I've gotten through like the first
661000	663000	I got through the tutorial level just playing around
663000	665000	And now I'm actually doing one of the levels for real
665000	670000	You know, like I said, I've really been busy doing a lot of other projects
670000	676000	But this is, it's really fun, it's a fun little game
676000	679000	And once I play more I'm actually going to do a little write up on it
679000	683000	Oh my gosh, our website might actually get some content outside of the
683000	685000	Lovely, and don't get me wrong, I love the I love that song
685000	689000	But that's about the only new content our website gets besides show updates
689000	692000	So that would be great, I'd love that
692000	694000	What?
694000	696000	New content for the site, it'd be great
696000	697000	Oh yeah
697000	700000	I mean, you know, we have the I love that song, that's it
700000	702000	You know, we get it, people love music
702000	704000	My brain was still on the game, so I was like, what?
704000	706000	Oh, that, yeah
706000	709000	See, I'd already forgotten about it
709000	711000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
711000	715000	It was okay, just, you know, playing Grand Theft Auto at work
715000	718000	And that was fun, and then
718000	723000	Let's see, this weekend I played through some of Just Cause 2
723000	727000	Just the beginning, because I have a version of the game
727000	729000	That has some of the PC mods on it
729000	731000	So that was kind of fun to play around with
731000	734000	Although, I don't think I ripped it right because
734000	738000	A lot of the textures weren't appearing, so it was kind of hard to play
738000	741000	But it was fun nonetheless, so I re-ripped it
741000	744000	And hopefully it'll work this time
744000	748000	And then of course, more Escaluda 2
748000	753000	This time I went through the Black Label Novice
753000	755000	And that was fun
755000	757000	I'll probably play through the rest of the game later on
757000	760000	Just kind of go in one version of the game at a time
760000	764000	And...
764000	766000	What else did I play?
766000	770000	I don't think I played in Final Fantasy 13
770000	774000	So yeah, I think that's about it, unfortunately
774000	780000	I gotta be honest, my gaming week this week was not really that action-packed
780000	782000	I really didn't play anything but WoW
782000	785000	I had a very Jamie week this week, actually
785000	788000	Nothing but Star Trek Online, except for playing Star Trek Online with WoW
788000	791000	Oh, I did play Star Trek Online last night, sorry
791000	794000	Oh my bad, well that's just a given
794000	797000	Well no, I hadn't touched it for a while, but I did play it last night
797000	801000	I will say this though, obviously I've been going through personal stuff with the job change
801000	804000	It's not a boo-hoo for me, well actually it's a good thing
804000	806000	But it just takes away from the gaming schedule
806000	812000	I will say this, on the Warcraft front I actually did accomplish quite a bit
812000	818000	I actually got one of my new characters, my warrior that I've been leveling with Alan
818000	821000	We got those together to Northrend, which is a big event
821000	823000	We're in the new content, the Wrath of the Lich King
823000	826000	But I will also say this, for the first time finally this week
826000	829000	I know, I'm a little late, I'm not much of a raider usually
829000	833000	I usually run the raids a lot, and WoW I used to about a year ago, but I don't really do it anymore
833000	836000	But this week, just randomly got asked to go, I went
836000	842000	I ran Icecrown Citadel, the new, well newish, it's not that new anymore for a WoW player
842000	846000	But a couple months old raid, that's basically the end game right now
846000	849000	The Lich King is the boss of Icecrown Citadel at the very very end
849000	853000	I was there for a couple hours, we got to the gunship battle
853000	855000	I had to go because I had other commitments
855000	857000	But we fought the first two bosses, it was cool
857000	861000	So I can finally say I've seen the inside of Icecrown Citadel, woo!
861000	864000	I need to run it again though, because you get reputation just for killing monsters in there
864000	867000	You can get cool rings, and stuff
867000	872000	So, that was it, I had a pretty Warcraft wonderful week
872000	875000	I will try to get back into some of the consoles this week
875000	878000	I know there's some stuff for Game Room coming out, we'll get to later in the show
878000	880000	That I definitely want to get around to
880000	884000	Although something that somehow missed the show role, so I'll bring it up now
884000	887000	I heard there were layoffs at Chrome this week
887000	890000	Apparently the Chrome studio in Australia had some big layoffs
890000	893000	And didn't they make Game Room?
893000	896000	So, are we screwed?
896000	897000	Probably not
897000	902000	They have the emulation already set, it's just putting a ROM with an emulator in place
902000	904000	Probably not even that, just putting a ROM in place
904000	906000	Well they do other games too though right?
906000	907000	Yeah they do other stuff
907000	909000	So maybe this just impacts the other stuff
909000	911000	Because I was reading it had nothing to do with Game Room
911000	914000	Even though Game Room kind of met with a reception
914000	919000	But that it was more the fact that they didn't get the rights to some Wii game they were going to do
919000	922000	Based on, I don't remember now
922000	924000	Somebody in chat will correct me
924000	926000	But there was some game they were supposed to do
926000	929000	I think it was like a movie tie-in or a sequel or something on the Wii
929000	931000	That they didn't end up getting to do and that kind of hurt them
931000	934000	Isn't it always a movie tie-in or sequel on the Wii?
934000	935000	Yeah
935000	936000	So
936000	937000	Alright
937000	941000	Anyhow, that's it for my gaming week and for my extra little news story I was throwing in there
941000	943000	See I'm starting the news before we even started the news
943000	946000	Housekeeping tonight, not a lot of show notes
946000	949000	I believe we're still here every week for the foreseeable future
949000	952000	Although I will say our anniversary show is creeping up on us
952000	956000	And our anniversary show is going to be the 27th I think of June?
956000	961000	I don't know, it'll be the 27th of June
961000	964000	Will be our what, 8 year anniversary show?
964000	965000	Jeez
965000	966000	I know right?
966000	968000	So that's in about 8 weeks
968000	970000	And Memorial Day is coming up
970000	972000	I think we're still all here for Memorial Day
972000	974000	I don't think, is anyone going out of town for Memorial Day?
974000	975000	No
975000	977000	And we still have a show on Memorial Day
977000	978000	Alright
978000	980000	No Fonomy this year again
980000	981000	I might be going actually
981000	982000	Are you going to go?
982000	983000	I don't know, it depends
983000	985000	I'd like to go and just kind of drop in
985000	988000	But we keep forgetting to like, oh yeah we should like try to get a panel
988000	992000	But that's got to be set in stone by now so we missed out on that one
992000	996000	Maybe go just to say hey, we'll see
996000	998000	Alright um
998000	1000000	Not that many people come and see us at panels anyways
1000000	1002000	I've had fun
1002000	1003000	It's always fun
1003000	1004000	I don't know
1004000	1007000	More people came out of Fonomy than some of the other places I've gone
1007000	1009000	To do panels
1009000	1012000	Well sometimes when you have panels at 7 in the morning
1012000	1014000	It's kind of difficult to get a crowd
1014000	1015000	Hey that was fun
1015000	1017000	That one kid who showed up had a good time
1017000	1020000	It's like what the hell are we doing here, seriously
1020000	1022000	Alright
1022000	1024000	Why'd I wake up early for this?
1024000	1027000	Did you see that I've done a little bit of cleaning in here, a little bit?
1027000	1028000	A little bit
1028000	1030000	So I've started the
1030000	1032000	Your bookshelf looks a lot nicer than it used to
1032000	1033000	Massive task
1033000	1034000	It really does
1034000	1036000	I've been starting the massive task of organizing this room
1036000	1038000	Alright
1038000	1040000	I'm putting pictures on the thing
1040000	1044000	Ray Ayanami in chat says there aren't any OLR fans at Fonomy anyway
1044000	1046000	There's a few, there's the one guy who every year we're there
1046000	1048000	Asked Loki some mat question
1048000	1050000	Like why are you such a Mac hater?
1050000	1052000	There's some kid every year
1052000	1054000	Cause of you
1054000	1057000	That should be your response next year
1057000	1059000	Alright
1059000	1061000	Because of stupid design decisions
1061000	1065000	Like for example iTunes doesn't work with Windows XP 64 bit
1065000	1069000	For no reason whatsoever other than we want to be douchebag
1069000	1071000	Wait, Windows 7 64 bit? Yes it does
1071000	1073000	No, Windows XP 64 bit
1073000	1075000	No it does not
1075000	1077000	No it does not
1077000	1079000	Trust me
1079000	1081000	I have experience
1081000	1083000	It will not let you install it
1083000	1085000	Wait, there's an XP 64 bit?
1085000	1086000	I didn't even know that
1086000	1088000	I know there's Windows 7 64 bit
1088000	1090000	That's what I run now
1090000	1091000	But, alright
1091000	1094000	It does not support it for no reason other than Mac is retarded
1094000	1097000	Um, yeah you're not a designer so
1097000	1100000	Alright, can we please get onto gaming news
1100000	1103000	And not the PC Mac wars again
1103000	1104000	Jesus
1104000	1106000	I put up the pictures on my bookshelf since it's awesome
1106000	1108000	Gaming news, Loki
1108000	1110000	Um, there is a rumor
1110000	1112000	Coming from Bloomberg
1112000	1114000	That apparently
1114000	1116000	An ex-News Corp president
1116000	1118000	Peter Churman
1118000	1120000	Was engaged in talks
1120000	1122000	Or I guess is currently engaged in talks
1122000	1124000	With Microsoft to possibly launch
1124000	1126000	An Xbox Live television channel
1126000	1129000	Now this isn't necessarily gonna be a channel
1129000	1131000	That we see on TV
1131000	1133000	Focused around the Xbox
1133000	1135000	It's actually gonna be something that's gonna appear
1135000	1136000	On Xbox Live
1136000	1137000	Apparently
1137000	1139000	During an April 12th meeting
1139000	1141000	At Microsoft's
1141000	1143000	Reverend Washington office
1143000	1145000	Churman proposed a channel
1145000	1147000	Native to the Xbox 360
1147000	1149000	That would feature reruns and original shows
1149000	1151000	For an additional
1151000	1153000	One to two dollars
1153000	1155000	Per month on top of the standard
1155000	1157000	Xbox Live subscription fee
1157000	1159000	And
1159000	1161000	So it's basically
1161000	1163000	Peter is talking to lots of people
1163000	1165000	About lots of ideas in the digital space
1165000	1167000	And of course
1167000	1169000	Microsoft is not commenting
1169000	1171000	On it but it kind of
1171000	1173000	Fits with the rumor
1173000	1175000	That we had last week that apparently
1175000	1177000	Conan was in talks
1177000	1179000	With
1179000	1181000	Possibly Microsoft for doing his show
1181000	1183000	On Xbox Live
1183000	1185000	It's kind of interesting
1185000	1187000	Um
1187000	1189000	Who's to say this is off the table?
1189000	1191000	I don't think it is
1191000	1193000	I don't think it is either
1193000	1195000	I think this isn't so much a rumor about
1195000	1197000	What would have been
1197000	1199000	I think this is a rumor about what's going to come
1199000	1201000	I think maybe the fact that Conan
1201000	1203000	Didn't go to Xbox maybe
1203000	1205000	Slowed it down
1205000	1207000	But not that much
1207000	1209000	You know what I mean? Well it's very risky
1209000	1211000	What were the realistic chances of Conan going to Xbox Live anyway?
1211000	1213000	It's very risky
1213000	1215000	Being that it's not established yet
1215000	1217000	You don't know what kind of benefits and stuff
1217000	1219000	And if the whole thing flopped
1219000	1221000	It would be a wasted opportunity
1221000	1223000	So it's a more safe
1223000	1225000	More safe bet for him to go to
1225000	1227000	TBS
1227000	1229000	But if
1231000	1233000	If Netflix
1233000	1235000	And all that works on Xbox
1235000	1237000	Then why can't
1237000	1239000	This
1239000	1241000	I think this would be a good idea
1241000	1243000	Just depends on the amount of content
1243000	1245000	That's on here because a lot of people nowadays
1245000	1247000	With cable and satellite bills
1247000	1249000	Are higher and higher
1249000	1251000	If this is only going to be
1251000	1253000	The equivalent of possibly $12 to $24
1253000	1255000	A year
1255000	1257000	And the content's good
1257000	1259000	A lot of people would probably jump on that
1259000	1261000	I know I would if it's got
1261000	1263000	Some good shows on there
1263000	1265000	And even just shows that are on normal
1265000	1267000	Cable TV or something like that
1267000	1269000	I'd be all for that
1269000	1271000	Wouldn't that be ironic though
1271000	1273000	If you were getting your
1273000	1275000	Television through cable
1275000	1277000	And getting your TV through
1277000	1279000	Because your Xbox is actually your cable provider
1279000	1281000	Well thanks to the FCC
1281000	1283000	And Comcast
1283000	1285000	And stuff like that I'm sure that
1285000	1287000	Since now
1287000	1289000	They're trying to
1289000	1291000	Not pass the net neutrality
1291000	1293000	Those laws and stuff
1293000	1295000	That they'll be able to
1295000	1297000	Filter it out
1297000	1299000	Oh Comcast, you want to get TV through our cable internet?
1299000	1301000	No, I'm sorry
1301000	1303000	That's not going to happen
1303000	1305000	I think something's going to happen
1305000	1307000	Where that's going to
1307000	1309000	The minute those little loopholes get exposed
1309000	1311000	That stuff's going to get revoked
1311000	1313000	Playing quickly
1313000	1315000	But hopefully it's not just wishful thinking
1315000	1317000	I'll be really sad
1317000	1319000	But maybe it'll go a long way
1319000	1321000	In trying to get some competitors to Comcast
1321000	1323000	Like people will come back to them?
1323000	1325000	I don't think so
1325000	1327000	As far as the Xbox
1327000	1329000	Channel goes though
1329000	1331000	I remember last week we kind of had a discussion
1331000	1333000	With the PlayStation tester and all that stuff
1333000	1335000	And you said something like you didn't really want to watch the tester
1335000	1337000	Because you thought it was going to be a big commercial for Sony
1337000	1339000	Well wouldn't an Xbox network
1339000	1341000	Be a big commercial for Microsoft or
1341000	1343000	It all depends on what content's on there
1343000	1345000	Here's the thing
1345000	1347000	The tester
1347000	1349000	Where the prize is
1349000	1351000	Becoming a Sony PlayStation tester
1351000	1353000	Come on
1353000	1355000	I mean of course it's going to be focusing
1355000	1357000	On a lot of the games that Sony has
1357000	1359000	And people are like, oh my god I'm so excited to play the next
1359000	1361000	Big Sony game coming out
1361000	1363000	That's retarded
1363000	1365000	And yes if there was something like that on the Xbox
1365000	1367000	TV channel
1367000	1369000	I wouldn't want to watch it either because it would just be a waste of my time
1369000	1371000	It would still be a damn commercial for something
1371000	1373000	Now if they had something that was
1373000	1375000	Mainstream
1375000	1377000	Like something that's on TV for example
1377000	1379000	That might be
1379000	1381000	That's different
1381000	1383000	If they had episodes of The Office or something like that
1383000	1385000	Playing on there
1385000	1387000	Just whatever
1387000	1389000	You know what I mean?
1389000	1391000	Well I don't have Netflix
1391000	1393000	Oh okay I guess you got me there
1393000	1395000	But Netflix is so cheap
1395000	1397000	Is it a dollar a month cheap?
1397000	1399000	No not that cheap
1399000	1401000	Alright
1401000	1403000	But you'd have to pay for this TV thing too right?
1403000	1405000	Isn't that what they were talking about?
1405000	1407000	Yeah like an extra dollar or two a month
1407000	1409000	That's what they're looking to charge
1409000	1411000	I guess that's not that bad
1411000	1413000	Would I have to pay that Microsoft phony points?
1413000	1415000	I don't think so, probably not
1415000	1417000	It's interesting if it wouldn't be just
1417000	1419000	Cause you know we talk about Xbox, Xbox, Xbox
1419000	1421000	But why wouldn't
1421000	1423000	I mean if Microsoft's gonna launch a TV station
1423000	1425000	Why wouldn't it be available on your computer?
1425000	1427000	Why wouldn't it be available on your
1427000	1429000	Windows mobile phone?
1429000	1431000	Something to compete with the iPhone
1431000	1433000	I would think that
1433000	1435000	An Xbox network is not really an
1435000	1437000	Xbox network, it's a
1437000	1439000	Microsoft network
1439000	1441000	Well doesn't
1441000	1443000	I mean they have MSNBC
1443000	1445000	Maybe streaming stuff from that I don't know
1445000	1447000	I think
1447000	1449000	The MSNBC agreement's a little funky
1449000	1451000	I think it's a little more NBC than it is
1451000	1453000	MS at this point but I don't know
1453000	1455000	I don't know the ins and outs of how all that works
1455000	1457000	I guess I should stop trying to sound like an expert
1457000	1459000	Move on to another story
1459000	1461000	Let's talk about the PlayStation 3
1461000	1463000	Since we've had a little bit of Xbox news
1463000	1465000	And talk about PlayStation 3
1465000	1467000	And there is some feathers
1467000	1469000	Being ruffled on the PlayStation 3 this week
1469000	1471000	And it has to do with the game
1471000	1473000	Fight Double Impact or as I call it
1473000	1475000	Magic Sword Double Impact
1475000	1477000	You see what's happened
1477000	1479000	Is that this game will just
1479000	1481000	Not run unless you are signed
1481000	1483000	In online on your PlayStation Network
1483000	1485000	Account if you try to load the game
1485000	1487000	And you're not signed in you're just gonna
1487000	1489000	Get a message that says you need to sign into the PlayStation
1489000	1491000	Network well
1491000	1493000	You know I know a lot of people myself
1493000	1495000	Included it doesn't really matter because
1495000	1497000	With the PS3s having the wireless
1497000	1499000	Internet built in and everything I'm pretty much
1499000	1501000	Always connected to PlayStation Network
1501000	1503000	There's very little time I'm
1503000	1505000	Not playing the PS3 and I'm not online
1505000	1507000	But
1507000	1509000	I mean what if my internet went down
1509000	1511000	And I wanted to play
1511000	1513000	A video game which I do a lot
1513000	1515000	When my internet goes down to kind of pass the time
1515000	1517000	You know if I can't play wow I guess I'll go play
1517000	1519000	Xbox or PSN
1519000	1521000	So
1521000	1523000	I mean this thing is kind of weird
1523000	1525000	This is no better than the Ubisoft thing in my opinion
1525000	1527000	No it's not
1527000	1529000	You have to understand
1529000	1531000	Why they're doing it in the first place
1531000	1533000	They're doing it because Sony
1533000	1535000	Has this thing and this
1535000	1537000	It's kind of a loophole basically
1537000	1539000	They had a thing where if you download a title
1539000	1541000	Say you buy whatever
1541000	1543000	You know a game flower or something like that
1543000	1545000	You can repurchase
1545000	1547000	Or redownload flower onto
1547000	1549000	Five different systems
1549000	1551000	Say your system dies or whatever
1551000	1553000	Instead of having to you know
1553000	1555000	Change your
1555000	1557000	Account so that
1557000	1559000	It's linked to a new system
1559000	1561000	Instead of that you have
1561000	1563000	Five different chances to download stuff
1563000	1565000	Well here's what people are doing
1565000	1567000	They were basically having one person
1567000	1569000	Buy it then downloading it for four
1569000	1571000	Of their other friends on their other system
1571000	1573000	So basically one person buys the game and five people
1573000	1575000	Play it
1575000	1577000	This is a feature that's in
1577000	1579000	The Playstation Network
1579000	1581000	This is something that launched with the PS3
1581000	1583000	Capcom apparently
1583000	1585000	Wanted to try something because they didn't like
1585000	1587000	The fact that they're losing out on
1587000	1589000	80% of their sales potentially
1589000	1591000	So what they're doing now
1591000	1593000	Is they're limiting that to one person
1593000	1595000	Now so you have to be the person
1595000	1597000	That bought it in order to play the game
1597000	1599000	So not only are they making you be
1599000	1601000	Online they are also
1601000	1603000	Limiting the fact that you can't share this
1603000	1605000	Or redownload it again
1605000	1607000	Unless you're the person that used it
1607000	1609000	And if it turns out to be a success
1609000	1611000	This is going to be something that's going on with
1611000	1613000	All their titles going forward
1613000	1615000	Well what's also interesting about this
1615000	1617000	Capcom actually issued somewhat of an apology
1617000	1619000	Later in the week a couple days after this news hit
1619000	1621000	Capcom actually
1621000	1623000	Sent out a statement
1623000	1625000	Capcom would like to formally apologize for the issues
1625000	1627000	Consumers are having with the PS3 version of
1627000	1629000	Final Five Double Impact
1629000	1631000	Typically the notification for a required Playstation
1631000	1633000	Network connection appears in the full game
1633000	1635000	Description when a game is downloaded from the Playstation
1635000	1637000	Store
1637000	1639000	Unfortunately when populating this content
1639000	1641000	Was overlooked and wasn't included in the
1641000	1643000	Versions of the game that released in North America
1643000	1645000	And Asia
1645000	1647000	It was included in the release for Europe
1647000	1649000	Capcom should have checked to make sure the notification
1649000	1651000	Was included when the final game was made available
1651000	1653000	And we sincerely apologize for this oversight
1653000	1655000	The DRM requirements for Final Five Double Impact
1655000	1657000	Are not unique to this release
1657000	1659000	This protection mechanism has been implemented in numerous
1659000	1661000	Games offered on the Playstation Store before
1661000	1663000	Which ones?
1663000	1665000	Yeah I don't know
1665000	1667000	When it was brought to our attention and the notification was missing
1667000	1669000	We texted quickly with Sony Computer Entertainment
1669000	1671000	America and a fix is on the way
1671000	1673000	Yay they're gonna fix it
1673000	1675000	Wait a minute
1675000	1677000	They're not really gonna fix the DRM are they?
1677000	1679000	They're just gonna fix the description
1679000	1681000	Probably
1681000	1683000	That's the hidden subtext there
1683000	1685000	We would like to thank our vigilant fans for bringing this
1685000	1687000	To our attention and we will exercise better
1687000	1689000	Scrutiny on future Capcom releases
1689000	1691000	Next time we might use some lube
1693000	1695000	Honestly
1695000	1697000	Here's the thing
1697000	1699000	It sucks that you have to be online
1699000	1701000	And yeah okay it will suck that you won't be able to play Final Fight
1701000	1703000	If your internet goes out
1703000	1705000	Big deal
1705000	1707000	Play something else
1707000	1709000	I mean seriously
1709000	1711000	That can't be the only game you're playing
1711000	1713000	And finally I mean really the whole reason they're doing this
1713000	1715000	Is because people are exploiting a feature
1715000	1717000	In the Playstation 3
1717000	1719000	That's really meant for if your system craps out
1719000	1721000	So you can redownload your content
1721000	1723000	Do you really want that to be removed?
1723000	1725000	Later on you know cause you have people
1725000	1727000	Complaining about it and then your console dies
1727000	1729000	Oh guess what you gotta download everything again
1729000	1731000	Oh I mean you have to rebuy everything again
1731000	1733000	Well I mean you're making a good point
1733000	1735000	Loki but at the same time
1735000	1737000	I just don't like this
1737000	1739000	I have nothing to back that up
1739000	1741000	I just don't like it
1741000	1743000	But no I'm not the only one
1743000	1745000	And isn't this just inviting
1745000	1747000	Cause a lot of this is really reminiscent
1747000	1749000	Whatever the reason is for it
1749000	1751000	It really isn't that much different from the Ubisoft DRM
1751000	1753000	Please hack me
1753000	1755000	Please find a workaround for this
1755000	1757000	Please pretty please
1757000	1759000	Hackers of America, break me
1759000	1761000	It's the same type of logic
1761000	1763000	That you know you apply to children
1763000	1765000	Tell them they can't do something
1765000	1767000	What do they want to do? Do it
1767000	1769000	Why don't they just send a fancy wedding invitation
1769000	1771000	On the fancy paper that says you are cordially invited
1771000	1773000	To hack the fuck out of this game
1773000	1775000	Cause people can't really
1775000	1777000	Hack the Playstation Network right now
1777000	1779000	Right now
1779000	1781000	It's cause they took the Linux out
1781000	1783000	But they'll be back
1783000	1785000	Okay I'm booting whoever this recruit is
1785000	1787000	In the chat room
1787000	1789000	New rule, you have to have a nickname
1789000	1793000	Well you would have to have one if you want me to read your name
1793000	1795000	Cause otherwise there's nothing to read
1795000	1797000	When you guys make a lovely Jack comments
1797000	1799000	Why are you booting a recruit?
1799000	1801000	Jamie's on the warpath tonight
1801000	1803000	I'm getting sick of people who just come in and ghost
1803000	1805000	And if you want to ghost like make
1805000	1807000	I am a ghost for your nickname
1807000	1809000	But otherwise don't just be there
1809000	1811000	Maybe they don't have anything to say right now
1811000	1813000	They could be a spy
1813000	1815000	They're not a spy
1815000	1817000	What's going to stop a spy from just saying
1817000	1819000	I'm a normal person
1819000	1821000	Okay they gave themselves a name
1821000	1823000	Right as soon as they gave themselves a name
1823000	1825000	They got kicked
1825000	1827000	See you guys are mean
1827000	1829000	Alright chat.orangelsonsready.com
1829000	1831000	Some actual comments from chat
1831000	1833000	Bochikawa whether or not they want to get more sales
1833000	1835000	Still makes a hassle for the regular legitimate user
1835000	1837000	That's going to cost them sales from people not liking the hassle
1837000	1841000	You know Loki not everybody's home is wired to be on the internet all the time
1841000	1843000	Then how are you going to download the damn game
1843000	1845000	Well not wired to be on the internet the whole time
1845000	1847000	What possible situation would you have
1847000	1849000	Other than your internet going out
1849000	1851000	That you would not be on the internet
1851000	1853000	You can't dial up
1853000	1855000	You can't dial up and download
1855000	1857000	Maybe not everybody has wireless internet in their house
1857000	1859000	So they actually run a wire when they want to download something
1859000	1861000	Then they pull the wire when they're done
1861000	1863000	So they're going to have to run that wire every time they want to play the game
1863000	1865000	All the way in the kid's bedroom or something
1865000	1867000	I don't know just
1867000	1869000	I don't think Final Fight is a really good kid's game
1869000	1873000	When I say kid it could be a 15, 16 year old where you know
1873000	1877000	If I had a 16 year old I wouldn't care if he was playing Final Fight
1877000	1879000	I can think of worse games
1879000	1881000	Even if there are training hookers
1881000	1883000	I'm sure they have
1883000	1885000	You know a computer
1885000	1887000	Download MAME download the ROM done
1887000	1889000	Look at that don't even have to be connected to the internet
1889000	1891000	And it doesn't cost you anything
1891000	1893000	Frisbee says in what incentive does paying for DRM
1893000	1895000	Infective programs give?
1895000	1899000	So I think the subtext I'm reading there is that
1899000	1901000	When you know this is the case you should just not buy it
1901000	1903000	Or buy it on our system
1903000	1905000	I did buy it on Xbox I had no idea this is the case
1905000	1907000	Apparently a lot of people bought it on Xbox
1907000	1909000	Because this took a few days to come out
1909000	1911000	The news which maybe says something right there
1911000	1913000	I don't know
1913000	1915000	Regardless we're going to see the DRM mania
1915000	1919000	Continue for the next few years I'm sure
1919000	1921000	As we get into the next system
1921000	1923000	That sounds like a photoshop to me
1923000	1925000	Just take DRM mania and remove the U out of it
1925000	1927000	I was thinking the same thing
1927000	1931000	What if the only thing you can find is a percussion freaks machine
1931000	1933000	Then you're not looking hard enough
1933000	1935000	Dark Soccer what you got for us
1935000	1937000	Good news
1937000	1939000	Marvel vs Capcom 3
1939000	1943000	They've released the poster art and there's already speculation
1943000	1945000	As to who is going to be in the game
1945000	1949000	So it goes without saying that everything we said last week
1949000	1951000	Yeah it happened
1951000	1955000	So of course for the confirmed characters we have
1955000	1957000	Morgan
1957000	1959000	Chris Redfield
1959000	1961000	Wolverine
1961000	1963000	Hulk
1963000	1965000	Iron Man
1965000	1967000	Is Chris Redfield the Jill sandwich guy?
1967000	1969000	Shirmi's trying to get out
1969000	1971000	Yeah from Resident Evil
1971000	1977000	Him vs the Hulk I'm surprised he hasn't been stepped on and just gone squish
1977000	1981000	The little trailer they put up was pretty freaking cool
1981000	1983000	What did you think of the art style in it?
1983000	1985000	I liked it
1985000	1987000	It totally made me think of Street Fighter 4
1987000	1989000	I've heard some mixed things on it
1989000	1991000	Not everybody I've talked to was a fan of the art style in the trailer
1991000	1993000	Well they can suck it
1993000	1995000	It's just like Tatsunoko vs Capcom if you ask me
1995000	2001000	At any rate the speculation on who the other characters are and a lot of these I actually
2001000	2005000	Although I have a few speculations of my own from this
2005000	2007000	They're showing Felicia
2007000	2009000	Super Scroll
2009000	2011000	Captain America
2011000	2013000	Doctor Doom
2013000	2015000	Although I'm sort of thinking Taskmaster
2015000	2017000	Maybe
2017000	2019000	Deadpool of course duh
2019000	2021000	Chun Li who cares
2021000	2023000	Question mark person
2023000	2025000	Oh yay question mark person
2025000	2027000	I just happened to be looking
2027000	2029000	And they haven't identified that person yet
2029000	2031000	There's one back there that could be Iron Fist
2031000	2033000	Black Widow or someone else
2033000	2035000	Dante
2035000	2037000	And Frank West
2037000	2039000	Fuck yes to Frank West
2039000	2041000	Hell yes
2041000	2043000	And looking at some of these others
2043000	2045000	They're actually even speculating
2045000	2047000	Some of the
2047000	2049000	They're speculating Trish maybe
2049000	2051000	And a few other kinda
2051000	2053000	I would say
2053000	2055000	Kinda niche
2055000	2057000	Marvel people not really niche
2057000	2059000	It's just you have to really be fans of the books that they're in
2059000	2061000	Well if that rumor that came up last week
2061000	2063000	Is true that it's gonna have just a
2063000	2065000	Mass amount of characters in it
2065000	2067000	I think they're gonna have to get a little niche
2067000	2069000	Yeah Dormammu
2069000	2071000	Is in it well they're saying
2071000	2073000	Mephisto got crossed out I think that's funny
2073000	2075000	But yeah
2075000	2077000	I don't care I just want it
2077000	2079000	And you're just gonna play Deadpool all day
2079000	2081000	You know just Deadpool all day long
2081000	2083000	He has to talk the whole time though
2083000	2085000	It's not Deadpool if he does not talk
2085000	2087000	Your ass off the entire game
2087000	2089000	So they're gonna have to pay his voice actor a lot
2089000	2091000	We'll see what happens
2091000	2093000	And I also want the guy to do the voice actor
2093000	2095000	Who does Deadpool in Friends
2095000	2097000	Now there was some reaction in our chat room
2097000	2099000	To you going over those names
2099000	2101000	We had Act Deaf yelled out Deadpool
2101000	2103000	And then Yland
2103000	2105000	Followed that up by saying Be Arthur
2105000	2107000	Now I
2107000	2109000	I don't remember what capcom game
2109000	2111000	Be Arthur was in was there a Golden Girls game
2111000	2113000	No I have to explain this
2113000	2115000	Deadpool
2115000	2117000	Has or had
2117000	2119000	A major obsession with Be Arthur
2119000	2121000	And who doesn't
2121000	2123000	As in like
2123000	2125000	She was his hot chick ideal
2125000	2127000	Who's Be Arthur
2127000	2129000	And I think it's funny how people have paid attention
2129000	2131000	To that cause like in the Deadpool in Friends
2131000	2133000	PSA things that are out
2133000	2135000	In Deadpool's
2135000	2137000	Apartment on there he's like don't you wish your girlfriend
2137000	2139000	Was hot like bee
2139000	2141000	With a picture of Be Arthur
2141000	2143000	I never knew that
2143000	2145000	You know I only you know I don't really read
2145000	2147000	Comics that's no secret you know I just
2147000	2149000	Don't but I liked the character
2149000	2151000	In the what Iron Man movie
2151000	2153000	When Ryan Reynolds played Deadpool
2153000	2155000	He played Wade
2155000	2157000	Well he was funny
2157000	2159000	That's pretty much the type of non stop
2159000	2161000	Talking your ear off
2161000	2163000	I want to hear except you know more nuts
2163000	2165000	Cause he is crazy
2165000	2167000	So sadly
2167000	2169000	They weren't talking about any
2169000	2171000	Type of like actual Be Arthur
2171000	2173000	Being in the game
2173000	2175000	Now they're bringing a Deadpool and of course
2175000	2177000	Deadpool has to be followed by Be Arthur and
2177000	2179000	Someone hasn't said Chimichangas
2179000	2181000	Why wasn't there a Golden Girls
2181000	2183000	Video game actually can you imagine
2183000	2185000	Like firing up you know Playstation Network
2185000	2187000	You know and hopefully the DRM
2187000	2189000	The cheesecake is a lie
2189000	2191000	That's right and then you know you just turn it on
2191000	2193000	And then
2193000	2195000	The cheesecake is a lie
2201000	2203000	What exactly would you do in the Golden Girls video game
2203000	2205000	Eat cheesecake
2205000	2207000	The plan should be a hoe
2207000	2209000	Sophia would be angry
2209000	2211000	She'd have her anger snark meter
2211000	2213000	You know what
2213000	2215000	I would like to see this as an XNA game
2215000	2217000	Like I realize you can't do a Golden Girls
2217000	2219000	XNA game cause copyright IP
2219000	2221000	But there's no reason you couldn't do a
2221000	2223000	Senior
2223000	2225000	Silver Ladies
2225000	2227000	The Silver Ladies
2227000	2229000	You know adventure game
2229000	2231000	Or something
2231000	2233000	I always thought it was funny that Estelle Getty played Be Arthur's character's mom
2233000	2235000	Yet she was younger
2235000	2237000	That's what they call makeup
2237000	2239000	I love Estelle Getty
2239000	2241000	I like Be Arthur too I used to watch Mod
2241000	2243000	Re-runs of Mod
2243000	2245000	I love them both rest in peace
2245000	2247000	Betty White hosting Saturday Night Live
2247000	2249000	Next week by the way
2249000	2251000	Betty White doing a roast
2251000	2253000	I saw her
2253000	2255000	It was something else that she was
2255000	2257000	Participating in a roast for somebody
2257000	2259000	She is snarky
2259000	2261000	I love her
2261000	2263000	I'll tell YYR to get right on it
2263000	2265000	Please make that happen
2265000	2267000	I don't care who does it
2267000	2269000	We need that to happen
2269000	2271000	Rama says call it three old biddies
2271000	2273000	Actually weren't there four
2273000	2275000	One was the mom so whatever
2275000	2277000	SSG100Matt says wait wait
2277000	2279000	Is this an OLR dream game?
2279000	2281000	This is a Rob Roberts dream game
2281000	2283000	Three biddies in the ho
2287000	2289000	I don't think it's just me
2289000	2291000	I was listening to
2291000	2293000	The Warcraft outsiders
2293000	2295000	In the car
2295000	2297000	They're another all game show
2297000	2299000	Michelle and John I think his name
2299000	2301000	I think Michelle's sister was the guest this week
2301000	2303000	And she was talking about that she named her character
2303000	2305000	Spornak
2305000	2307000	And wow
2307000	2309000	This is my new favorite
2309000	2311000	Person that I've ever heard on a podcast
2311000	2313000	She named her character
2313000	2315000	After the Golden Girls and I think Michelle
2315000	2317000	Or somebody else popped in and said yeah I named one of my
2317000	2319000	I named one of my priests
2319000	2321000	Betty Smite
2323000	2325000	And I was like this is
2325000	2327000	That's it my next
2327000	2329000	My next
2329000	2331000	Star Trek character
2331000	2333000	Is gonna be
2333000	2335000	I'm just gonna name her Sophia the old
2335000	2337000	And pick like
2337000	2339000	The old person face and everything
2339000	2341000	And make her super short and Ferengi
2341000	2343000	I'm gonna put that on the list of people I want to have
2343000	2345000	On OLR in the future the chick that named her character
2345000	2347000	Spornak
2347000	2349000	Cause that's awesome you're a true inspiration
2349000	2351000	To us all alright
2351000	2353000	Let's move on to other gaming news
2353000	2355000	Loki's just sitting here going
2355000	2357000	What is this show tonight?
2357000	2359000	I don't know
2359000	2361000	Well
2361000	2363000	Just like Nintendo to delay some stuff
2363000	2365000	Actually just like anybody to delay some stuff
2365000	2367000	But Nintendo
2367000	2369000	In this particular instance has delayed
2369000	2371000	Two upcoming games that are very
2371000	2373000	Highly anticipated
2373000	2375000	Including Sin and Punishment Star Successor
2375000	2377000	And Metroid Other M
2377000	2379000	Sin and Punishment has only been pushed back a few weeks
2379000	2381000	From June 7th to June 27th
2381000	2383000	And unfortunately
2383000	2385000	Though the
2385000	2387000	Metroid Other M game
2387000	2389000	Which was originally due on
2389000	2391000	June 27th
2391000	2393000	Well that's been pushed all the way to August 31st
2393000	2395000	No that was the day after my birthday and I'm gonna have to wait
2395000	2397000	Two more months
2397000	2399000	That gives me enough time to actually hook up
2399000	2401000	My Nintendo Wii again
2401000	2403000	I haven't plugged it in since I moved
2405000	2407000	Why are these games being delayed Loki?
2407000	2409000	No reason was given
2409000	2411000	Other than it's Nintendo just
2411000	2413000	Doing Nintendo things
2413000	2415000	Do you think that maybe the
2415000	2417000	Games aren't finished
2417000	2419000	Or they failed some type of quality check or what?
2419000	2421000	I don't think that they're not finished yet
2421000	2423000	I think that they're just
2423000	2425000	Spacing out their titles
2425000	2427000	For the rest of the year
2427000	2429000	They had two games coming out in June
2429000	2431000	That really didn't have anything on the plate
2431000	2433000	For the rest of the summer
2433000	2435000	And maybe polishing
2435000	2437000	Metroid Other M a little bit more
2437000	2439000	Or maybe
2439000	2441000	They're gonna add some gimmicky
2441000	2443000	Crap to add onto it
2443000	2445000	I hope that god they're not delaying this
2445000	2447000	To add on some like vitality
2447000	2449000	Sensor support or some crap like that
2449000	2451000	Oh I hope not either
2451000	2453000	Well uh
2453000	2455000	At least you'll get the plate at E3 I'm sure
2455000	2457000	Yeah I guess that's true
2457000	2459000	Alright well all this news
2459000	2461000	About the Nintendo Wii and the delays
2461000	2463000	Leads me into a little something
2463000	2465000	I want to do on tonight's show
2465000	2467000	We don't do this very often especially on the podcast
2467000	2469000	But we're gonna do a little something called
2469000	2471000	Secret Club tonight is what we're gonna do
2471000	2473000	Here on the show
2473000	2475000	That's right Secret Club
2475000	2477000	It's a secret to everyone
2477000	2479000	Alright
2479000	2481000	Here's the deal with Secret Club
2481000	2483000	I have a secret and I want to tell you guys
2483000	2485000	Cause I can't keep secrets to myself
2485000	2487000	And this is one of those things where somebody said
2487000	2489000	Hey Rob I found out this secret and you know I don't really care
2489000	2491000	If you talk about it on your show
2491000	2493000	So of course I've got a big mouth
2493000	2495000	And I'm gonna tell you guys
2495000	2497000	There's actually two kinds of secrets
2497000	2499000	Cause you know I do have friends that work with games
2499000	2501000	So if you tell anyone this I'm gonna beat your fucking ass with my shoe
2501000	2503000	Those I don't tell anybody
2503000	2505000	But then there's the ones that's like
2505000	2507000	Hey Rob I found out this little piece of news
2507000	2509000	And I don't care who you tell
2509000	2511000	So this is a little something secret
2511000	2513000	But you didn't hear it from me
2513000	2515000	Cause you know due to things that have happened in the past on this show
2515000	2517000	I don't really want to get
2517000	2519000	You know I don't think
2519000	2521000	OLR really gains anything
2521000	2523000	From you know having broken the news first
2523000	2525000	Or what have you
2525000	2527000	But it's a little secret something something
2527000	2529000	I didn't hear it here but you heard it
2529000	2531000	The Black Nintendo Wii
2531000	2533000	Is coming
2533000	2535000	And it's coming soon
2535000	2537000	I have it on good authority from a friend
2537000	2539000	That works for a major
2539000	2541000	Store that sells a lot of
2541000	2543000	Game hardware and video games
2543000	2545000	That there was some type of
2545000	2547000	Alert this week that they're going to be getting
2547000	2549000	A large shipment of Black Nintendo
2549000	2551000	Wiis on May
2551000	2553000	23rd is the release date of the
2553000	2555000	Black Wii and apparently this actually
2555000	2557000	Ties into something we've heard about before because
2557000	2559000	This is the bundle that's also going to include
2559000	2561000	We're not sure and
2561000	2563000	The details were a little sketchy from
2563000	2565000	My source cause he couldn't remember if it was
2565000	2567000	That it was coming with just the
2567000	2569000	Wii Motion Plus or if it was
2569000	2571000	The Wii Motion Plus and Wii Sports
2571000	2573000	Resort It's Wii Sports Resort and Wii Motion Plus
2573000	2575000	But Loki has previously heard of
2575000	2577000	That there was going to be a new bundle that matched
2577000	2579000	What we saw at Walmart before but we're
2579000	2581000	Putting two and two together
2581000	2583000	What Loki had probably heard about before is actually going to be this
2583000	2585000	Black Nintendo Wii bundle
2585000	2587000	That's right
2587000	2589000	There was no color specifications
2589000	2591000	Or anything just basically that they're
2591000	2593000	Going to be releasing new bundles soon
2593000	2595000	And that
2595000	2597000	We probably weren't going to get any
2597000	2599000	Cause they're dicks
2599000	2601000	And folks from chat
2601000	2603000	I haven't heard anything else about the specs
2603000	2605000	No it's not HD, dream on guys
2605000	2607000	It's just a Wii
2607000	2609000	It's the Wii, it's the same damn Wii
2609000	2611000	Except here's the difference, instead of
2611000	2613000	White plastic
2613000	2615000	They used black plastic
2615000	2617000	That's it, don't expect
2617000	2619000	Anything else, so sorry
2619000	2621000	It's not HD
2621000	2623000	And it may be an extra free game cause I'm assuming they're also
2623000	2625000	Including Wii Sports in there so you get
2625000	2627000	Wii Sports and Wii
2627000	2629000	Sports Resort, it'd be nice if they added another
2629000	2631000	Controller into it
2631000	2633000	I doubt it
2633000	2635000	I think it's supposed to be the same price
2635000	2637000	It is, it's going to be the exact
2637000	2639000	I must have forgot to say that, it is the exact
2639000	2641000	Same price as the Wii you're paying for today
2641000	2643000	So in a way it's a bit of a price drop too
2643000	2645000	I wonder what they're going to do with
2645000	2647000	I think it actually may be replacing
2647000	2649000	The old Wii SKUs
2649000	2651000	So white Wiis are going to be rare
2651000	2653000	That's right, super rare
2653000	2655000	TigerClaw in chat says a black Wii is a no brainer
2655000	2657000	We sort of had a hint of that recently
2657000	2659000	When we saw a black Wiimote on the most recent trailer
2659000	2661000	For Metroid Other M, well they're already selling black Wiimotes
2661000	2663000	Yeah they are
2663000	2665000	And then the folks overseas are saying
2665000	2667000	We've already had the black Wii
2667000	2669000	Hey hey hey hey hey
2669000	2671000	I'm not controlling the news
2671000	2673000	I don't write the news, I just report it
2673000	2675000	The black Wii is not out in the states
2675000	2677000	So they're finally getting it
2677000	2679000	May 23rd, and that's what I'm telling you
2679000	2681000	Is the date, May 23rd
2681000	2683000	Alright
2683000	2685000	Yeah it's already been out in other parts of the world
2685000	2687000	Don't they have other colors too?
2687000	2689000	Like remember E3 years ago there was like a pink Wii
2689000	2691000	And a blue Wii and all this other stuff
2691000	2693000	I don't know
2693000	2695000	Let's see Tiger, no I'm sorry
2695000	2699000	SHA100Matt says so wait the black Wii isn't bigger than the white Wii?
2699000	2701000	Ha ha ha
2701000	2703000	Ha ha ha everybody's a jokester here at Orange Laundry
2703000	2705000	Ha ha ha
2707000	2709000	Going back to something we were talking about a little bit earlier
2711000	2713000	TigerClaw sent me this link in chat
2713000	2715000	And I just have to share this with you guys
2715000	2717000	This link on YouTube that is just pretty fabulous here
2717000	2721000	This is what could be
2725000	2727000	It's an actual, somebody did this on the NES
2727000	2729000	It's like a hack or something
2729000	2731000	I don't know what
2733000	2735000	I don't know what that is
2735000	2737000	Some type of like hacked NES cartridge or something
2741000	2743000	So somebody's already started making my dream game
2743000	2745000	Alright
2745000	2747000	Let's move on to some real games shall we
2747000	2749000	How about Halo? Hey don't tune out
2749000	2751000	Halo, I've got Halo updates
2751000	2753000	Halo, Halo Reach specifically
2753000	2755000	Halo Reach apparently
2755000	2757000	Is going to, well you know
2757000	2759000	Who knew? Halo Reach
2759000	2761000	Is going to have all different types of releases
2761000	2763000	It's not just going to be regular Halo Reach
2763000	2765000	But there's going to be a bunch
2765000	2767000	Of other types of Halo Reaches coming out
2767000	2769000	This is a leak from a Best Buy
2769000	2771000	Ad apparently
2771000	2773000	60 bucks if you want to just get Halo Reach by itself
2773000	2775000	150 dollars
2775000	2777000	For the legendary edition
2777000	2779000	And there's going to be a limited edition
2779000	2781000	Of Halo Reach, it's going to be 80 dollars
2781000	2783000	Standard version is just the game itself
2783000	2785000	Limited version has a special
2785000	2787000	Case, collectibles
2787000	2789000	And in-game armor
2789000	2791000	The 150 dollar option
2791000	2793000	Apparently has all of that but also has
2793000	2795000	I guess more unique packaging and in-game
2795000	2797000	Armor, also a legendary
2797000	2799000	Noble 6 sculpture
2799000	2801000	I don't know if that's anything like
2801000	2803000	The little Master Chief hat that you could put on
2803000	2805000	Your cat for lols
2805000	2807000	You couldn't really put it on your cat just so you know
2807000	2809000	But sounds kind of similar
2809000	2811000	Can't you still get
2811000	2813000	That Halo 150 dollar edition
2813000	2815000	For like 60 bucks now discounted at price
2815000	2817000	There's people still sitting on that stuff
2817000	2819000	I'm not surprised
2819000	2821000	Hopefully this will sell a little better but we'll see
2821000	2823000	What do you think about all this game
2823000	2825000	Coming out in three different flavors, Loki?
2825000	2827000	They did it with Halo 3
2827000	2829000	And it was kind of fun
2829000	2831000	But hopefully people learned
2831000	2833000	You don't need to spend the money
2833000	2835000	To get a fake helmet
2835000	2837000	At least this has a nice sculpture that comes with it
2837000	2839000	I wouldn't pay that though
2839000	2841000	Yeah because if you think about it
2841000	2843000	You're basically paying
2843000	2845000	Between 80 and 150 you're paying like 70 dollars
2845000	2847000	For the sculpture, you could use that money to get
2847000	2849000	Another game if you wanted
2849000	2851000	Or you could use it to
2851000	2853000	Invest
2853000	2855000	And have 200 dollars
2855000	2857000	Next year
2857000	2859000	But there it is
2859000	2861000	I realize there are the fans that will pay
2861000	2863000	That money to have every little thing Halo
2863000	2865000	And who am I to criticize
2865000	2867000	If it was Final Fantasy 14 I'd probably be doing the same thing
2867000	2869000	I'd be like 150 dollars that's it
2869000	2871000	I'm paying the money right now
2871000	2873000	Shh
2873000	2875000	Well we've got some word from
2875000	2877000	Bimani style about Stride Nasty stuff
2877000	2879000	That's sponsoring it
2879000	2881000	And keep in mind I am completely allergic to it
2881000	2883000	And I don't even like to say the name of it
2883000	2885000	So it's nasty
2885000	2887000	It's Stride Gum
2887000	2889000	Nasty
2889000	2891000	Save the arcades too
2891000	2893000	But
2893000	2895000	Arcade Infinity
2895000	2897000	Is actually
2897000	2899000	One of the ones up in the
2899000	2901000	Competition for it
2901000	2903000	AI
2903000	2905000	Has been like a really big staple
2905000	2907000	In the Bimani community
2907000	2909000	They had all the imports in
2909000	2911000	They also had that weird Gundam game that was so cool
2911000	2913000	And like little Japanese ticket games
2913000	2915000	And Jameralami
2915000	2917000	And it's in LA
2917000	2919000	In case you didn't know
2919000	2921000	Well it's in East LA
2921000	2923000	It was born in East LA
2923000	2925000	And also they were selling import cars for a while
2925000	2927000	That's right
2927000	2929000	I think the owners were big big big on the import cars
2929000	2931000	I think they drove some nice cars
2931000	2933000	I actually
2933000	2935000	Looked into getting a Skyline from them
2935000	2937000	When I thought I had money
2937000	2939000	Nice
2939000	2941000	And that's where Loki did you play some crazy porn game there once
2941000	2943000	That's funny
2943000	2945000	I played a lot of crazy porn games there
2945000	2947000	That's where I first played
2947000	2949000	Gals Panic and Dancing Eyes
2949000	2951000	But at any rate
2951000	2953000	The competition is going on
2953000	2955000	Until June 15th
2955000	2957000	And they're talking about
2957000	2959000	The
2959000	2961000	AI
2961000	2963000	The owner says that if they win they want to get
2963000	2965000	Tycho and Juby
2965000	2967000	But you have to
2967000	2969000	Play a game of Calbots 2010
2969000	2971000	And get your final score
2971000	2973000	To the arcade you wish to support
2973000	2975000	And that's at savethearcades.stridegum.com
2975000	2977000	Well I mean
2977000	2979000	Is Arcade Infinity in danger of closing or something
2979000	2981000	I mean haven't they been threatening to close for a little while now
2981000	2983000	I don't see anything really about
2983000	2985000	But they're talking about if they won they'd get a Juby
2985000	2987000	Machine and all this other stuff
2987000	2989000	Or U-Beat or whatever it's called
2989000	2991000	I guess
2991000	2993000	Weird
2993000	2995000	We're not picking you up
2995000	2997000	I'm talking
2997000	2999000	I'm talking in the mic
2999000	3001000	Alright
3001000	3003000	Well if you want to support them then there you go
3003000	3005000	You can go play that little game and submit your score
3005000	3007000	But then you have to sign up for spam emails
3007000	3009000	So hopefully you have an actual spam email address
3009000	3011000	Or something to send stuff to
3011000	3013000	Alright let's go around the world
3013000	3015000	And take a look at some upcoming release dates
3015000	3017000	And games
3017000	3019000	That are coming to a living room near you
3019000	3021000	Loki
3021000	3023000	Yes lots of stuff coming out this week
3023000	3025000	Well not a whole ton
3025000	3027000	Start things off with
3027000	3029000	Super Street Fighter IV
3029000	3031000	That's going to be coming out on PlayStation 3
3031000	3033000	And Xbox 360
3033000	3035000	Nier
3035000	3037000	That kind of a beat em up game
3037000	3039000	From Square Enix coming out on PlayStation 3
3039000	3041000	And Xbox 360 this week as well
3041000	3043000	Death of the Rights Retribution
3043000	3045000	Also on PlayStation 3
3045000	3047000	And Xbox 360
3047000	3049000	You're a fan of
3049000	3051000	Sexual Induendo and Boobies
3051000	3053000	Record of Argus War
3053000	3055000	The limited edition or the
3055000	3057000	What was it? The naughty
3057000	3059000	I forget the
3059000	3061000	Some naughty edition or whatever
3061000	3063000	Coming out on Xbox 360 does include
3063000	3065000	A mouse pad with fake boobs on it
3065000	3067000	And a pillow case with some chick on it
3067000	3069000	So that's going to be kind of neat
3069000	3071000	Harvest Moon
3071000	3073000	Hero of Leaf Valley coming out on
3073000	3075000	PSP
3075000	3077000	Splinter Cell Conviction making its way out
3077000	3079000	On PC this week with wonderful
3079000	3081000	DRM in tow
3081000	3083000	And
3083000	3085000	Free Running
3085000	3087000	A parkour sim
3087000	3089000	Coming out on the Wii this week
3089000	3091000	2010 FIFA World Cup
3091000	3093000	South Africa coming out on
3093000	3095000	PlayStation 3, Xbox 360
3095000	3097000	Wii and
3097000	3099000	I don't remember
3099000	3101000	And PSP I don't think there's a DS version on that one
3105000	3109000	I believe that's it
3109000	3111000	Oh no this is actually a pretty good deal
3111000	3113000	Pixel Junk Monsters Deluxe
3113000	3115000	Making its way out on
3115000	3117000	PSP in the UMD format
3117000	3119000	They've had this originally on
3119000	3121000	The PlayStation Network
3121000	3123000	But now you can buy it on UMD
3123000	3125000	Only $10
3125000	3127000	And it includes I believe some of the
3127000	3129000	Expansions for that. They're doing the same thing too
3129000	3131000	With Fat Princess coming out a little bit later on
3131000	3133000	In May
3133000	3135000	Not a bad thing at all
3135000	3137000	Alright. Any of that that you're going to pick up
3137000	3139000	Logie?
3139000	3141000	I'm going to try Super Street Fighter 4
3141000	3143000	And Nier
3143000	3145000	Yeah I'm going to pick up
3145000	3147000	Super Street Fighter 4
3147000	3149000	But this time I'm getting it on PS3
3149000	3151000	Because I would like to actually be able to control it better
3151000	3153000	So that's my whole thought there
3153000	3155000	This way you get arcade sticks Rob
3155000	3157000	Or just play it over here
3157000	3159000	And you're talking more money
3159000	3161000	But they're worth it
3161000	3163000	Xbox 360 in Japan
3163000	3165000	Sees the release of Super Street Fighter 4
3165000	3167000	This week as well in a regular and
3167000	3169000	Collectors Edition
3169000	3171000	Otherwise Splinter Cell Conviction is your other big release in Japan
3171000	3173000	This week. See some of the same games we're getting here
3173000	3175000	Also get released in Japan at the same time
3175000	3177000	Imagine that
3177000	3179000	Looking at some other consoles
3179000	3181000	Going over to the PlayStation 3
3181000	3183000	Same same. They also get Super Street Fighter 4
3183000	3185000	Over there
3185000	3187000	Regular and Collectors Edition
3187000	3189000	World Soccer winning 11 2010 gets a price reduction
3189000	3191000	For whatever that's worth
3191000	3193000	If you're a big fan of these soccer sims
3193000	3195000	On the Nintendo Wii
3195000	3197000	Not really a lot this week
3197000	3199000	Base Fishing Wii World Tournament
3199000	3201000	Andukensa X and a game called
3201000	3203000	Rooms comes out as well
3203000	3205000	From Hudson. That's all on the Nintendo Wii this week
3205000	3207000	On the PlayStation 2
3207000	3209000	I like the name of this game
3209000	3211000	Love Route Zero
3211000	3213000	Kiss Kiss Labyrinth
3213000	3215000	Yes that's really the name of the game
3215000	3217000	Love Route Zero
3217000	3219000	Kiss Kiss Labyrinth
3219000	3221000	It's an adventure game
3221000	3223000	You can get shots
3223000	3225000	But the box art looks to be like
3225000	3227000	All these dudes in school outfits
3227000	3229000	But there's this girl who looks like the prom queen
3229000	3231000	Yeah why am I trying to figure this out?
3231000	3233000	None of you are going to play it
3233000	3235000	I already know that. None of you are going to play it
3235000	3237000	Going on to the handheld systems
3237000	3239000	And looking at what is coming out
3239000	3241000	On the Nintendo DS
3241000	3243000	Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 2
3243000	3245000	Is a big release from Squeenix this week
3245000	3247000	On the Nintendo DS
3247000	3249000	And lastly on the Sony PSP
3249000	3251000	Ikitosan Cross Impact
3251000	3253000	And that cross is spelled with an actual X
3253000	3255000	Just to be complicated
3255000	3257000	That is coming out in Japan
3257000	3259000	This week
3259000	3261000	That is a sequel to a former
3261000	3263000	PSP game
3263000	3265000	2D scrolling action
3265000	3267000	22 girls in this beat em up game
3267000	3269000	And their clothes come off
3269000	3271000	Is that really what this is about?
3271000	3273000	Well that's what Ikitosan is about
3273000	3275000	Based on what I've seen I guess
3275000	3277000	Nice
3277000	3279000	They fight and their clothes rip in very
3279000	3281000	Evocative ways I guess
3281000	3283000	Also Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker
3283000	3285000	I bet some of you guys might want to get that
3285000	3287000	There's also a full PSP pack for that game coming out
3287000	3289000	And I just like the name of this game
3289000	3291000	Marriage Royale Prism Story
3291000	3293000	Is also coming out
3293000	3295000	It's an adventure game
3295000	3297000	I don't really know what happens in this game
3297000	3299000	I guess it's like you play the girl going to get married
3299000	3301000	But I want to point this out there's a screenshot here
3301000	3303000	Where you have these three cute little anime girls
3303000	3305000	They're like working out or something
3305000	3307000	That is tragic
3307000	3309000	Um actually
3309000	3311000	No I know it's like a swimsuit
3311000	3313000	You know how girls wear the one piece and put the shirt on
3313000	3315000	No no Rob actually that's what
3315000	3317000	Um gym uniforms look like
3317000	3319000	Really? Yeah they're the little bloomer
3319000	3321000	Shorts How's that not caught on over here?
3321000	3323000	Cause we're prudes
3323000	3325000	Clearly
3325000	3327000	So
3327000	3329000	Alright so if you want some
3329000	3331000	You know culturally different things
3331000	3333000	There you can check out that game
3333000	3335000	You probably won't
3335000	3337000	Alright how about the UK DarkSakura
3337000	3339000	Yeah how about em
3339000	3341000	On the 28th serious Sam HD
3341000	3343000	The second encounter
3343000	3345000	The 30th 2010 FIFA World Cup
3345000	3347000	Yay
3347000	3349000	30th God of War Collection
3349000	3351000	Iron Man 2
3351000	3353000	Splinter Cell Conviction
3353000	3355000	Super Street Fighter 4
3355000	3357000	WarioWare Do It Yourself
3357000	3359000	And Wings of Prey
3359000	3361000	That's it
3361000	3363000	Too bad it's not the birds of prey
3363000	3365000	Making it's way to a video game
3365000	3367000	That would be kinda awesome
3367000	3369000	Or not
3369000	3371000	Alright Loki
3371000	3373000	Ah yes
3373000	3375000	Um
3375000	3377000	Okay so we talked a little bit
3377000	3379000	Well I said that we had
3379000	3381000	Splinter Cell Conviction
3381000	3383000	Coming out this week and there's horrible
3383000	3385000	DRM in tow well that might not be
3385000	3387000	That big of a problem
3387000	3389000	Apparently the hacker community
3389000	3391000	Which I thought this happened weeks ago but
3391000	3393000	Maybe they finally figured out
3393000	3395000	How to do it the correct way
3395000	3397000	They have found a way to get rid of the
3397000	3399000	DRM
3399000	3401000	That's in
3401000	3403000	These titles that are being released from
3403000	3405000	MovieSoft including Assassin's Creed 2
3405000	3407000	And Settlers 7
3407000	3409000	And I'm assuming
3409000	3411000	Splinter Cell Conviction coming soon
3411000	3413000	It should be easy to modify the work
3413000	3415000	With that and the hacker group of course
3415000	3417000	Um
3417000	3419000	Involved in doing that was
3419000	3421000	I believe
3421000	3423000	Skid Row
3423000	3425000	Fun name
3425000	3427000	Awesome
3427000	3429000	And you know it is a little bit different
3429000	3431000	Before they had different hacks that were
3431000	3433000	Just emulating
3433000	3435000	The authentication server
3435000	3437000	Or they were
3437000	3439000	Finding some way to trick this but this
3439000	3441000	Actually removes the DRM from
3441000	3443000	The title so
3443000	3445000	Um that's interesting
3445000	3447000	Now Loki your pal Bobby Blackwolf in chat says
3447000	3449000	The hack before worked
3449000	3451000	Up until a certain point of the game
3451000	3453000	Then it locked up so this must be news
3453000	3455000	That now it's working for the entire game
3455000	3457000	There you go
3457000	3459000	So Loki
3459000	3461000	I mean does this really
3461000	3463000	Surprise you because I kind of look at this and go
3463000	3465000	Yeah I already thought this happened too
3465000	3467000	I thought this happened within days after the DRM
3467000	3469000	I'm not surprised
3469000	3471000	Especially you know something like
3471000	3473000	This that's annoying a lot of people
3473000	3475000	Not only
3475000	3477000	The fact that they're coming out and saying oh
3477000	3479000	This is going to stop piracy for all of our titles
3479000	3481000	It just goes to show
3481000	3483000	You're going to waste money on this
3483000	3485000	I mean it slows people down but it
3485000	3487000	Definitely doesn't stop it
3487000	3489000	And really in the end the only people that get hurt
3489000	3491000	Are the people that legitimately buy the game
3491000	3493000	Of course now if you don't like the DRM
3493000	3495000	You can just go search online for the crack
3495000	3497000	So
3497000	3499000	Like I just I understand the need for DRM
3499000	3501000	Like I'm not like somebody who says
3501000	3503000	Oh every game should just like
3503000	3505000	Not have DRM at all
3505000	3507000	I just think what Ubisoft was doing was overkill
3507000	3509000	I mean come on when you disconnect from the internet
3509000	3511000	At all your game dumps
3511000	3513000	Like do you know how much I get disconnected from World of Warcraft
3513000	3515000	Because Comcast decides to fart on me
3515000	3517000	And it just you know like I'll be in the middle of something
3517000	3519000	And it completely screws up my game
3519000	3521000	Like
3521000	3523000	Oh my gosh at least that isn't like a long term
3523000	3525000	Irritating thing
3525000	3527000	Whereas you know I could see if I'm playing through one of these games
3527000	3529000	I'm not at a save point maybe I just cleared
3529000	3531000	Like a really tough part of the game it's like
3531000	3533000	Oh you're screwed you gotta do it again
3533000	3535000	Yeah it'd be different if it was like
3535000	3537000	Okay we noticed you're you know
3537000	3539000	It disconnected we're saving your progress
3539000	3541000	Now
3541000	3543000	And you know you can restart here later once it
3543000	3545000	Reconnects
3545000	3547000	I mean that would be semi reasonable
3547000	3549000	To be fair didn't Ubisoft change some of that
3549000	3551000	Where it doesn't you don't really get booted
3551000	3553000	For the entire game now or something
3553000	3555000	I don't know
3555000	3557000	But the thing is
3557000	3559000	I'm not buying their games on PC
3559000	3561000	Even if it were buying their games
3561000	3563000	Which I'm not so
3563000	3565000	I don't know
3565000	3567000	Alright
3567000	3569000	Well a couple last stories for you guys
3569000	3571000	Then we're going to get into the classic game of the week
3571000	3573000	Where Dark Soccer is going to walk down the
3573000	3575000	Vaults of gaming's history and pick out a game
3575000	3577000	That she thinks you kids ought to check out this week
3577000	3579000	But first something about a newer series
3579000	3581000	Something that's kind of been a bit
3581000	3583000	Under the radar and I think that is a pity
3583000	3585000	And that is DJ Hero
3585000	3587000	DJ Hero of course we know that DJ Hero
3587000	3589000	Is getting a sequel this year
3589000	3591000	And little little details are starting to trickle out
3591000	3593000	About it DJ Shadow
3593000	3595000	Apparently is going to be working
3595000	3597000	On the next DJ Hero he actually
3597000	3599000	Said in an interview on Radio 1
3599000	3601000	It was interesting I'm actually working
3601000	3603000	On the next one as well but yeah it was a
3603000	3605000	Trip so there you go
3605000	3607000	He's going to be in the second game also notable
3607000	3609000	He was in the first game too so he's
3609000	3611000	Like a repeat and I kind of figured
3611000	3613000	That would happen is that like how many
3613000	3615000	World famous DJ's are there
3615000	3617000	Are there really enough world famous
3617000	3619000	World famous
3619000	3621000	There are a lot of DJ's
3621000	3623000	I think out there that are world famous
3623000	3625000	But you know how many
3625000	3627000	Of them are you going to get to
3627000	3629000	Be in DJ Hero
3629000	3631000	I was very disappointed that they had
3631000	3633000	DJ Jazzy Jeff and there were no
3633000	3635000	You know
3635000	3637000	Will Smith songs in there at all
3637000	3639000	No mixes with Will Smith
3639000	3641000	That was very disappointing
3643000	3645000	Well there you go DJ Shadow
3645000	3647000	Is going to be in the next game
3647000	3649000	In DJ Hero 2
3649000	3651000	But DJ Hero 1 All Love Is Not Lost
3651000	3653000	Loki you'll be happy to hear this
3653000	3655000	There's actually another track pack coming out
3655000	3657000	Yeah this one I'm actually kind of excited about
3657000	3659000	Last one kind of sucked
3659000	3661000	Darude's Sandstorm
3661000	3663000	Mixed with Josh Winke's Higher
3663000	3665000	State of Consciousness is one of the songs
3665000	3667000	In the new DLC
3667000	3669000	Danny Bird's Red Mist
3669000	3671000	VIP is coming
3671000	3673000	Out as well and then this song
3673000	3675000	Wolfgang Gartner's Wolfgang's
3675000	3677000	5th Symphony Let me start off by
3677000	3679000	Saying that this song reminded me of something
3679000	3681000	That you would see in DDR
3681000	3683000	Here's a little clip of what this song
3683000	3699000	Sounds like
3699000	3705000	It's a little noisy for me
3705000	3707000	Sounds like a remix song from Boom Boom Rocket
3707000	3709000	Remember how Boom Boom Rocket had nothing
3709000	3711000	But classical remixes
3711000	3713000	And it's really hard too
3713000	3715000	Like that's the other catch is that the song is
3715000	3717000	Incredibly hard and I guess all these songs that are in
3717000	3719000	This pack are supposed to be a very high difficulty
3719000	3721000	Hence why they are calling it
3721000	3723000	The Domination Pack
3723000	3725000	Because you can't just say it normally
3725000	3727000	It's the Domination Pack
3727000	3729000	Yippie Skippy
3729000	3731000	Are we going to be dominated?
3731000	3733000	Apparently you will be dominated
3733000	3735000	By the Domination Pack
3735000	3737000	So
3737000	3739000	But yeah I guess that song sounded okay
3739000	3741000	It's a little noisy for me
3741000	3743000	But I guess that's because there was so much mixing going on
3743000	3745000	I don't know
3745000	3747000	I think that that's the thing
3747000	3749000	Some of the effects are a little overdone
3749000	3751000	There's people that are going to like it
3751000	3753000	Don't get me wrong
3753000	3755000	Alright I don't know if I'll buy it
3755000	3757000	I'm curious to hear what the other songs sound like though
3757000	3759000	Anyhow let's get to the part of the show
3759000	3761000	Where we like to take a trip down the
3761000	3763000	Halls of gaming history
3763000	3765000	Dark Soccer
3765000	3767000	Dark Soccer is going to jump into the vault
3767000	3769000	And dive in and find a game
3769000	3771000	That she says hey you ungrateful little
3771000	3773000	Children
3773000	3775000	Because she says that a lot
3775000	3777000	Not teaching him Doctor Who references
3777000	3779000	I didn't teach him that
3779000	3781000	He watches Doctor Who
3781000	3783000	You kids ought to be
3783000	3785000	Playing this classic video game
3785000	3787000	So you can see where the games of today came from
3787000	3789000	Dark Soccer what is the
3789000	3791000	Classic video game of the week this week?
3791000	3793000	Warcraft Orcs and Humans
3793000	3795000	Oh snap
3795000	3797000	I didn't put this in for all of you addicts
3797000	3799000	Who don't know your roots
3799000	3801000	Fair enough
3801000	3803000	Warcraft Orcs and Humans
3803000	3805000	Freaking boring ass game
3805000	3807000	This game is awesome
3807000	3809000	Shut your mouth
3809000	3811000	See I wanted that reaction
3811000	3813000	So I didn't put this in
3813000	3815000	Really for me
3815000	3817000	Because I hate real time strategy games
3817000	3819000	I don't like them I do not have fun with them
3819000	3821000	But
3821000	3823000	There are enough of you
3823000	3825000	That don't know where your game came from
3825000	3827000	Sorry
3827000	3829000	No it's true there's not
3829000	3831000	There's a lot of people that play World of Warcraft
3831000	3833000	That never played a Warcraft game before
3833000	3835000	I mean it's worth noting
3835000	3837000	I actually mentioned to someone
3837000	3839000	When World of Warcraft just came out
3839000	3841000	Did you play Warcraft before?
3841000	3843000	No it just came out
3845000	3847000	Poor childhood
3847000	3849000	I see so tonight is about edumacation
3849000	3851000	It's about edumacation
3851000	3853000	It's a real time strategy game
3853000	3855000	It came out in 1994
3855000	3857000	November 1984 and came out on the Mac in 96
3857000	3859000	And
3859000	3861000	It was a sequel Warcraft 2 Tides of Darkness
3861000	3863000	And then of course
3863000	3865000	Warcraft 3
3865000	3867000	Warcraft 3 came out not too long ago
3867000	3869000	If you look on Dan's little shelf there
3869000	3871000	He's got a copy
3871000	3873000	So Dan obviously likes it
3875000	3877000	And
3877000	3879000	It's basically
3879000	3881000	You know like I said real time strategy
3881000	3883000	Where you have the humans of Azeroth
3883000	3885000	Against the invading orcs
3887000	3889000	And then both sides have to
3889000	3891000	Fight off wild monsters
3891000	3893000	Sometimes you can
3893000	3895000	Enlist the monsters
3895000	3897000	So basically
3897000	3899000	You've got your melee groups
3899000	3901000	You have ranged groups and spellcasters
3901000	3903000	It is built
3903000	3905000	Off of the Dune 2
3905000	3907000	Gameplay
3907000	3909000	Which is like build a base, build an army
3909000	3911000	Destroy the enemy
3911000	3913000	Blah blah blah
3913000	3915000	Different mission types where you have
3915000	3917000	Rebels of each player
3917000	3919000	So you can
3919000	3921000	Rescue, rebuild towns
3921000	3923000	And friendly forces
3923000	3925000	And do all this other stuff
3925000	3927000	And you also have to be able to
3927000	3929000	Efficiently use your platoon
3929000	3931000	Also
3931000	3933000	In one mission you have to kill the orc chief's
3933000	3935000	Daughter or something
3935000	3937000	It also
3937000	3939000	Let you use
3939000	3941000	Lands
3941000	3943000	So that you could play against each other
3943000	3945000	So it had that
3945000	3947000	Start of the MMO remember
3949000	3951000	Sorta yeah
3951000	3953000	Like the old school battle net
3953000	3955000	But I was more Diablo
3955000	3957000	On battle net
3957000	3959000	Well you have to go through
3959000	3961000	With this you also have to cultivate
3961000	3963000	Your resources
3963000	3965000	Be careful about where you dig for gold
3965000	3967000	Where you chop your wood
3967000	3969000	If you exhaust your resources
3969000	3971000	Then you have to get them
3971000	3973000	Differently
3973000	3975000	You have to basically
3975000	3977000	Regrow your forest while you're taking
3977000	3979000	From them, you have different types of magical
3979000	3981000	Buildings, you have
3981000	3983000	Different types of sorcerers
3983000	3985000	Like you have a cleric, you can have
3985000	3987000	Necrolite that raises skeletons
3987000	3989000	Ooh
3989000	3991000	Elementals, that type of thing
3991000	3993000	The conjurer versus
3993000	3995000	The warlock you know
3995000	3997000	Um
3997000	3999000	And then of course it's sort of an overhead
3999000	4001000	Interface
4001000	4003000	And it's a click and point
4003000	4005000	Um
4005000	4007000	Yeah you know
4007000	4009000	It actually
4009000	4011000	Was
4011000	4013000	I see I thought
4013000	4015000	That it was
4015000	4017000	I played some a little bit but like I said I don't really care for
4017000	4019000	RTS games
4019000	4021000	They just I'm sort of like what
4021000	4023000	I can play them and I'm good at them
4023000	4025000	I'm just sort of like what this is boring
4025000	4027000	But
4027000	4029000	It clearly caught on I mean
4029000	4031000	Cause remember we had you know
4031000	4033000	Starcraft
4033000	4035000	You know the whole
4035000	4037000	I guess themes to the game sort of caught on
4037000	4039000	To and I mean now we've got World of Warcraft
4039000	4041000	Making it you know less sucky
4043000	4045000	Again this is Jamie who
4045000	4047000	Does not like RTS's
4047000	4049000	I actually own this game
4049000	4051000	And I loved it so
4051000	4053000	There is actually an RTS game
4053000	4055000	That I like but it's a Macross game
4055000	4057000	That came out on um
4057000	4059000	The uh PC Engine CD
4059000	4061000	I will say this though I am weird
4061000	4063000	I fully admit I'm weird cause I don't really
4063000	4065000	Care for Starcraft and I
4065000	4067000	To this day have never played Warcraft 3
4067000	4069000	You've got it right here
4069000	4071000	I just for some reason have never played it
4071000	4073000	I really should because maybe some of the stuff
4073000	4075000	In World of Warcraft will make more sense
4075000	4077000	But yeah I have played the old school Warcraft
4077000	4079000	And I did play Warcraft 2
4079000	4081000	And I actually tried to make it a point to put in games
4081000	4083000	That I can be really excited about
4083000	4085000	But it was just you know
4085000	4087000	It seemed to me that with everybody
4087000	4089000	Being all
4089000	4091000	World of Warcraft World of Warcraft blah blah blah blah
4091000	4093000	You know it helps to know
4093000	4095000	Where it came from it helps to go back to your roots
4095000	4097000	Um so as
4097000	4099000	Far as other um
4099000	4101000	Ones that came out though it did have some uh
4101000	4103000	Predecessors things that actually
4103000	4105000	Um
4105000	4107000	Would uh
4107000	4109000	Inspire the game and build the
4109000	4111000	Groundwork for it there was
4111000	4113000	Definitely some competitors
4113000	4115000	Um
4115000	4117000	Like I said Dune 2
4117000	4119000	Um and then Warcraft works and humans
4119000	4121000	Came out after that
4121000	4123000	Um
4123000	4125000	And then um
4125000	4127000	There was actually a random map generator
4127000	4129000	That was for it
4129000	4131000	And that came from
4131000	4133000	Civilization Rob
4133000	4135000	Yes
4135000	4137000	I thought that you'd find that interesting
4137000	4139000	Um
4139000	4141000	Command and Conquer actually um
4141000	4143000	Borrowed from
4143000	4145000	Warcraft and Age of Empires
4145000	4147000	Um put all of them in
4147000	4149000	In the random map generator when it came out
4149000	4151000	Um Modern Wars
4151000	4153000	Um for the Commodore 64
4153000	4155000	What uh incorporated
4155000	4157000	The use of land play
4157000	4159000	So it really
4159000	4161000	Not only was it influenced by
4161000	4163000	Some others but it actually pulled influence
4163000	4165000	It's actually even listing realms as
4165000	4167000	An old Amiga and Atari ST
4167000	4169000	Um game as being an influence on it
4169000	4171000	Um
4171000	4173000	And of course for sequels we got
4173000	4175000	Warcraft 2 Tides of Darkness
4175000	4177000	In 95 and
4177000	4179000	Warcraft 2 Beyond the Dark Portal in 96
4179000	4181000	And then um
4181000	4183000	Coming out later
4183000	4185000	Of course was Warcraft 3
4185000	4187000	Um Reign of Chaos
4187000	4189000	And then there was Starcraft like I said
4189000	4191000	And Starcraft Brood War and
4191000	4193000	World of Warcraft
4193000	4195000	And soon as Starcraft 2 for you RTS fans
4195000	4197000	Yeah I was about to get to that
4197000	4199000	So yeah Warcraft you know
4199000	4201000	It's expanded there's
4201000	4203000	Card games, comics, there's a ton of books
4203000	4205000	You've seen the books I'm sure
4205000	4207000	They actually um there's actually
4207000	4209000	A film called Warcraft
4209000	4211000	In production to be out in 2011
4211000	4213000	Yeah Spider-Man dude's
4213000	4215000	Doing it right?
4215000	4217000	Yeah I think there's also um
4217000	4219000	There's board games too
4219000	4221000	Um but yeah
4221000	4223000	Warcraft it really did
4223000	4225000	Kinda spur a whole you know
4225000	4227000	A whole big thing
4227000	4229000	11 million people
4229000	4231000	Can't be wrong or can they?
4231000	4233000	Addicts
4233000	4235000	Addicts
4235000	4237000	Your classic game of the week a true
4237000	4239000	Classic indeed in every way
4239000	4241000	Shape and form don't listen to Dark Sakura
4241000	4243000	No I'm not saying it's a
4243000	4245000	Bad game I'm saying I don't like
4245000	4247000	RTS's
4247000	4249000	And I and even that's including
4249000	4251000	Actraiser Warcraft oh you
4251000	4253000	Don't like Actraiser I didn't say I don't
4253000	4255000	Like Actraiser Actraiser
4255000	4257000	Is a good game I get bored
4257000	4259000	Bored bored after a while
4259000	4261000	I'm gonna cry alright
4261000	4263000	Oh Rob there's a there's a difference
4263000	4265000	Between thinking something is crap
4265000	4267000	And just not liking the genre of it
4267000	4269000	Yeah
4269000	4271000	I can see that I'm trying to think if there's something
4271000	4273000	I feel that way about I do every so often like
4273000	4275000	You know smiting people in Actraiser
4275000	4277000	See I would say that's how I feel about
4277000	4279000	Sports games but like I can go back and play
4279000	4281000	Old school sports games no problem like I love Tecmo
4281000	4283000	Bowl, Blades of Steel like the way they used to be before they
4283000	4285000	Just got super high impact like
4285000	4287000	Yeah before they got like really complicated
4287000	4289000	But that that's my point you know
4289000	4291000	I I'll start playing and I'll be like yeah
4291000	4293000	This is cool then I'm like uh huh
4293000	4295000	I will say
4295000	4297000	Not my thing I might have liked Warcraft
4297000	4299000	But I wasn't very good at it I never got very
4299000	4301000	Far in it like I'm not good
4301000	4303000	At RTS's
4303000	4305000	This whole thing I can
4305000	4307000	Do the strategy just fine
4307000	4309000	I just get bored with it it's not
4309000	4311000	Really my thing
4311000	4313000	Alright fair enough
4315000	4317000	Uh if you would
4317000	4319000	Like to suggest a classic game of the week
4319000	4321000	Too bad Dark Soccer doesn't take suggestions
4321000	4323000	By the way actually but you could always try the
4323000	4325000	Mailbag I need help from the chat room

4461000	4463000	For episode 364
4463000	4465000	Of our little program where we talk about
4465000	4467000	Video games and
4467000	4469000	It's been a fun show so far tonight
4469000	4471000	We've had news about DJ Hero
4471000	4473000	Yes even a type of
4473000	4475000	Food company that apparently Jamie won't say
4475000	4477000	Where they save the arcades at
4477000	4479000	Campaigns some Marvel vs. Capcom news
4479000	4481000	DRM debates
4481000	4483000	Television on the Xbox and plenty more news
4483000	4485000	To go through this week
4485000	4487000	Loki why don't you start us off with some fast
4487000	4489000	News tonight
4489000	4491000	Yes there's some WiiWare releases
4491000	4493000	Coming soon on
4493000	4495000	May 17th
4495000	4497000	Including that well
4497000	4499000	The next title in the Bit.Trip
4499000	4501000	Series Bit.Trip Runner
4501000	4503000	Will be coming out that day on WiiWare
4503000	4505000	And also there's some
4505000	4507000	Summer DSiWare release
4507000	4509000	Dates as well to share
4509000	4511000	Including Photo Dojo
4511000	4513000	Which looks like a side scrolling
4513000	4515000	Fighting game that uses a DSi's
4515000	4517000	Camera to add you to
4517000	4519000	The game
4519000	4521000	That's kind of neat I guess
4521000	4523000	Kind of gimmicky but fun
4523000	4525000	Earthworm Jim
4525000	4527000	Coming out also on
4527000	4529000	May 10th
4529000	4531000	And apparently I guess that's going to be an
4531000	4533000	Update to the SNES version
4533000	4535000	Of the game
4535000	4537000	Really
4537000	4539000	Another Frogger game
4539000	4541000	Frogger returns
4541000	4543000	Yet again on
4543000	4545000	People must be buying them Loki
4545000	4547000	May 24th
4547000	4549000	Konami has Frogger
4549000	4551000	Metal Torrent
4551000	4553000	On May 24th
4553000	4555000	Is a
4555000	4557000	Kira developed Shmup game
4557000	4559000	It looks pretty awesome
4559000	4561000	Xscape
4561000	4563000	Is I guess a
4563000	4565000	Sequel to Game Boy
4565000	4567000	Title
4567000	4569000	Or I guess a title X
4569000	4571000	From Q Games
4571000	4573000	And it's like a first person
4573000	4575000	Tank combat game
4575000	4577000	But really trippy looking
4577000	4579000	And then some other stuff
4579000	4581000	Coming out
4581000	4583000	Hero of Sparta
4583000	4585000	On May 31st
4585000	4587000	Flame Trail on June 7th
4587000	4589000	And Akapa's Trail on
4589000	4591000	June 14th
4591000	4593000	Then also another title that's going to be
4593000	4595000	Coming soon
4595000	4597000	This is kind of a pseudo
4597000	4599000	3D game
4599000	4601000	Luxley's
4601000	4603000	Lineup
4603000	4605000	And what's kind of unique about this
4605000	4607000	This is a game that came out in Japan
4607000	4609000	On DSiWare as well
4609000	4611000	And it's kind of a 3D game
4611000	4613000	It uses the
4613000	4615000	DSi's camera
4615000	4617000	To kind of trick the user
4617000	4619000	Into
4619000	4621000	Viewing the environment
4621000	4623000	In kind of a 3D dimensional fashion
4623000	4625000	You basically tilt the screen around
4625000	4627000	And doing so will change your perspective
4627000	4629000	In the game
4629000	4631000	And it's basically kind of a hidden
4631000	4633000	Objects game I guess
4633000	4635000	It looks kind of cool
4635000	4637000	Coming out as well
4637000	4639000	And then non-DSi related
4639000	4641000	Stuff
4641000	4643000	Battlefield Heroes
4643000	4645000	Is going to be getting some more
4645000	4647000	Upgrades
4647000	4649000	In the form of
4649000	4651000	Jetpacks
4651000	4653000	As well as some new maps and
4653000	4655000	New game mode
4655000	4657000	They're going to be getting
4657000	4659000	That's funny
4659000	4661000	I forgot that they had the
4661000	4663000	Michael Jackson content that one time
4663000	4665000	Anyways
4665000	4667000	I guess they're going to be getting
4667000	4669000	A new map
4669000	4671000	Called Midnight Mayhem
4671000	4673000	And a new mode that's going to be called
4673000	4675000	V2 Vengeance
4675000	4677000	Where players must capture and control
4677000	4679000	A giant rocket
4679000	4681000	But hey
4681000	4683000	Look, see they're
4683000	4685000	Bringing out jetpacks before Halo Reach
4685000	4687000	Can
4687000	4689000	Do you think that's why they're doing it?
4689000	4691000	Maybe
4691000	4693000	Maybe to get the jump on it?
4693000	4695000	I don't know
4695000	4697000	Just to be fun
4697000	4699000	Alright
4699000	4701000	Going to some other release dates coming up
4701000	4703000	We have some Xbox release dates
4703000	4705000	And some of the games that are coming out for the rest of April
4705000	4707000	On April 28th
4707000	4709000	New Game Room releases
4709000	4711000	That's right, finally some new titles for Game Room
4711000	4713000	And these will be under
4713000	4715000	Microsoft's Game Room pricing
4715000	4717000	Of either $3 for one
4717000	4719000	$5 for both or $0.50 for one play
4719000	4721000	Super Breakout from Atari
4721000	4723000	Pitfall and Mega Mania from Activision
4723000	4725000	I don't remember Mega Mania
4725000	4727000	Is that a game that rings a bell to you?
4727000	4729000	Mega Mania by Activision
4729000	4731000	I know the name, I just don't remember the game
4731000	4733000	I can't remember it either, I certainly know Pitfall
4733000	4735000	Night Stalker from Mattel
4735000	4737000	I'm assuming that's in television
4737000	4739000	Rack Em Up by Konami
4739000	4741000	Real Sports Volleyball by Atari
4741000	4743000	And Basketball by Atari
4743000	4745000	So those are all some new Game Room releases
4745000	4747000	Certainly I think Pitfall and Breakout are probably the standouts there
4747000	4749000	Although I want to say Mega Mania
4749000	4751000	Ringing a bell
4751000	4753000	But there's some other stuff on Xbox Live
4753000	4755000	This week we had Puzzle Chronicles and After Burner Climax
4755000	4757000	You know I meant to check out Puzzle Chronicles
4757000	4759000	Even though it looked a little weird
4759000	4761000	But next week is Tecmo Bowl on the 28th
4761000	4763000	So that's pretty cool
4763000	4765000	Also some Mega Man 10
4765000	4767000	Releases on the 28th
4767000	4769000	The Endless Attack mode
4769000	4771000	And two more special stages
4771000	4773000	Special Stage 2 and Special Stage 3
4773000	4775000	And then BioShock 2 gets the Rapture Metro pack
4775000	4777000	On April 29th
4777000	4779000	As well as a Black Market Aerial pack
4779000	4781000	For Just Cause 2 on April 29th
4781000	4783000	Being added to Games On Demand
4783000	4785000	On April 27th
4785000	4787000	Shrek the 3rd, Far Cry 2, and
4787000	4789000	Kane & Lynch Dead Men
4789000	4791000	And I don't know if Loki's interested
4791000	4793000	But if he wants to pimp out his avatar with Saints Row 2 items
4793000	4795000	He can do that on April 28th
4795000	4797000	I'm surprised that they're even doing that
4797000	4799000	Seeing as the game came out what, two years ago?
4799000	4801000	I mean seriously?
4801000	4803000	Isn't it a little late?
4803000	4805000	Is it a missed opportunity much?
4805000	4807000	Alright
4807000	4809000	Farmville News
4809000	4811000	I can't believe I'm reporting on this
4811000	4813000	What does this show come to?
4813000	4815000	But I think it's important to say
4815000	4817000	No I'm not going to tell you how to make money
4817000	4819000	Harvesting pineapples or whatever
4819000	4821000	But I think it goes without saying that Farmville
4821000	4823000	Is expanding beyond Facebook
4823000	4825000	And this would be because of a website
4825000	4827000	I guess that spies on domain names
4827000	4829000	That people are registering
4829000	4831000	And Zanga, the company behind Farmville
4831000	4833000	Has registered FarmvilleAndroid.com
4833000	4835000	FarmvilleiPad.com
4835000	4837000	FarmvilleiPhone.com
4837000	4839000	And FarmvilleSMS.com
4839000	4841000	And those are all
4841000	4843000	Domain names that are registered
4843000	4845000	By the Farmville folks
4845000	4847000	There you go
4847000	4849000	By the way I guess they're all also forwarding to
4849000	4851000	Farmville.com
4851000	4853000	So there you go
4853000	4855000	So needless to say
4855000	4857000	Farmville is slowly taking over the world
4857000	4859000	Run while you still can
4859000	4861000	If you're worried about Fishville or any of that yet
4861000	4863000	Also worthy of mention
4863000	4865000	There's a rare NES game called
4865000	4867000	Euphoria
4867000	4869000	Not like EU but U-F-O-U-R-I-A
4869000	4871000	Euphoria
4871000	4873000	It's been rated by the OFLC
4873000	4875000	Which is the Australian Ratings Board
4875000	4877000	This means that a virtual console release
4877000	4879000	Is likely possible
4879000	4881000	What's interesting about this game
4881000	4883000	It's pretty rare but it was actually done by Sunsoft
4883000	4885000	You might remember Sunsoft recently
4885000	4887000	Is kind of having a re-arising
4887000	4889000	They put out Blaster Master on Virtual Console
4889000	4891000	There was that OK
4891000	4893000	Blaster Master upgrade game
4893000	4895000	That also hit Virtual Console
4895000	4897000	Now apparently Euphoria the Saga is
4897000	4899000	Coming out as well. It's a Metroidvania
4899000	4901000	Type of game is what they're saying
4901000	4903000	It's a NES game
4903000	4905000	And it stars this character
4905000	4907000	You get separated from his friends
4907000	4909000	And you are looking through the world for your lost companions
4909000	4911000	I guess it's kind of like Goonies 2 in that regard
4911000	4913000	Hey actually that sounds kind of awesome
4913000	4915000	Goonies 2 is kind of Metroidvania 2
4915000	4917000	So there you go
4917000	4919000	The game was released in Europe just so you know
4919000	4921000	But I don't believe it was ever released actually in the US
4921000	4923000	Hence why it's rare
4923000	4925000	So there you go Euphoria possibly
4925000	4927000	On Virtual Console but usually those ratings news
4927000	4929000	Means yeah yeah they're coming
4929000	4931000	It's a cute little game
4931000	4933000	Real quickly before Jamie takes over with some news
4933000	4935000	The chat room is again complaining that the stream
4935000	4937000	Had failed and I guess we blacked out for a little bit there
4937000	4939000	Unfortunately
4939000	4941000	We don't know what causes it
4941000	4943000	And Bobby Blackwolf
4943000	4945000	Wants to clarify because you guys are hearing
4945000	4947000	That little bumper that says
4947000	4949000	All games are switching between it's live and on demand
4949000	4951000	Then that must mean it's on our end and it's not the all games computer
4951000	4953000	However we are not doing
4953000	4955000	Anything out of the ordinary
4955000	4957000	There's no one else's here but us 3's
4957000	4959000	There's no Xbox games going on or nothing
4959000	4961000	So you can thank Jamie's lovely internet provider
4961000	4963000	Hey!
4963000	4965000	Comcast. It's Comcastic
4965000	4967000	They were a wonderful shade of crap this morning
4967000	4969000	You know what my Warcraft has been going down too
4969000	4971000	In the area so you know what
4971000	4973000	Nobody's running porn
4973000	4975000	We did a porn check
4975000	4977000	Everything's fine so we just
4977000	4979000	We gotta keep on rolling with the show sorry guys
4979000	4981000	By the way
4981000	4983000	I do want to clarify that specifically
4983000	4985000	It is tournament edition
4985000	4987000	NBA Jam tournament edition for Playstation
4987000	4989000	That I'm looking for
4989000	4991000	Yes there's some on Amazon
4991000	4993000	But Dan hasn't told me I can buy it yet
4993000	4995000	Anyway
4995000	4997000	Brightband updates we have some new
4997000	4999000	Tracks coming out
4999000	5001000	There is Busted
5001000	5003000	Thunderbirds are Go
5003000	5005000	For 160
5005000	5007000	Microsoft points and 200
5007000	5009000	Wii points
5009000	5011000	Flyleaf again and Silverchair
5011000	5013000	Tomorrow
5013000	5015000	I don't see anything about an actual
5015000	5017000	Pack
5017000	5019000	Just the 3 tracks
5019000	5021000	Also somebody finally beat Castlevania
5021000	5023000	With a DDR pad
5023000	5025000	The old school
5025000	5027000	Castlevania like the first one
5027000	5029000	This dude named Nick Hagman
5029000	5031000	Played
5031000	5033000	The virtual console
5033000	5035000	Original Castlevania
5035000	5037000	Using a DDR Mario
5037000	5039000	Mix controller
5039000	5041000	And it took 62 lives
5041000	5043000	In more than 4 hours
5043000	5045000	But he did it
5045000	5047000	Wait a minute I'm looking at the YouTube here
5047000	5049000	Of the guy I guess who did it here
5049000	5051000	I don't want to hear his little monologue
5051000	5053000	I just want to see him play
5053000	5055000	And it looks like he's
5055000	5057000	Well in some pictures he's just
5057000	5059000	Sitting kind of using his hands but now
5059000	5061000	On this YouTube I'm looking where he's fighting Dracula
5061000	5063000	He is actually using his feet
5063000	5065000	To do it so
5065000	5067000	Cause I was gonna
5067000	5069000	Criticize this a little bit if he was actually just sitting
5069000	5071000	There kind of hitting the buttons but apparently he's actually
5071000	5073000	Dancing around I wonder if this kid lost weight
5073000	5075000	Doing it although he looks pretty
5075000	5077000	Skinny to begin with so
5077000	5079000	Wow
5079000	5081000	I slayed Pounce and
5081000	5083000	Dracula
5083000	5085000	Congratulations I guess
5085000	5087000	Yay for you
5087000	5089000	You have more time than I do
5089000	5091000	A winner it's you
5091000	5093000	And then Marvel vs Capcom
5093000	5095000	Comic books actually Udon
5095000	5097000	Who's been doing a lot of the Street Fighter
5097000	5099000	And you know basically any of the
5099000	5101000	The Capcom related
5101000	5103000	Comic titles that have come out
5103000	5105000	Are actually already
5105000	5107000	Discussing
5107000	5109000	The
5109000	5111000	Possibility of doing
5111000	5113000	Marvel vs Capcom
5113000	5115000	Of course they have to get the okay through Marvel as well
5115000	5117000	Marvel does their own thing
5117000	5119000	So who knows it'd have to be
5119000	5121000	Like a joint release but
5121000	5123000	Marvel does what Marvel wants
5123000	5125000	Yeah but hey it could be cool
5125000	5127000	It could be kind of interesting
5127000	5129000	What would you want to see in a Marvel vs Capcom
5129000	5131000	Comic book?
5131000	5133000	Deadpool
5133000	5135000	The Adventures of Deadpool
5135000	5137000	And Dan
5137000	5139000	Deadpool and Dan
5139000	5141000	Disney vs Capcom
5141000	5143000	The actual Dan is here to say something
5143000	5145000	Disney vs Capcom
5145000	5147000	Disney vs Capcom
5147000	5149000	I want Deadpool and Dan
5149000	5151000	How would that work?
5151000	5153000	Deadpool and Dan
5153000	5155000	Alright
5155000	5157000	I don't even know what's happening anymore
5157000	5159000	Help me
5159000	5161000	My husband hijacking the show again
5161000	5163000	Yeah again
5163000	5165000	Let's get into some Twitter topics
5165000	5167000	Every week we solicit your tweets
5167000	5169000	At www.Twitter.com
5169000	5171000	Slash O-L-R is our username
5171000	5173000	O-L-R
5173000	5175000	Show us your tweets
5177000	5179000	Where's the tweets? Here we go
5179000	5181000	TheShadowSniper sent us some tweets saying
5181000	5183000	I'm unable to listen live because I work late Sundays
5183000	5185000	I do carry around my Blackberry
5185000	5187000	Is it possible to listen live through my phone?
5187000	5189000	Ooh
5189000	5191000	Unfortunately we know of an iPod app
5191000	5193000	An iTouch app
5193000	5195000	I guess it runs on the iPad
5195000	5197000	That's the all games radio app
5197000	5199000	If you just search for all games
5199000	5201000	Or allgames.com in the iTunes store
5201000	5203000	That's a great way to listen
5203000	5205000	Unfortunately you're asking about the Blackberry
5205000	5207000	My advice would be
5207000	5209000	Get one of those, there's got to be like a radio tuner
5209000	5211000	Type app depending if your Blackberry
5211000	5213000	Has apps
5213000	5215000	You would actually be able to
5215000	5217000	Tune into the feed directly
5217000	5219000	It's just a shoutcast feed
5219000	5221000	So any feed that will do shoutcast streams
5221000	5223000	You can listen to all games radio on
5223000	5225000	TheShadowSniper also asks
5225000	5227000	What game ending is your favorite
5227000	5229000	Because of its twist ending
5229000	5231000	Or its great conclusion
5231000	5233000	This is a good topic I don't think we've
5233000	5235000	Talked about in a very long time
5235000	5237000	Favorite video game ending, DarkSakura?
5237000	5239000	Huh? Favorite video game ending
5239000	5241000	Favorite video game ending?
5241000	5243000	It was a twist?
5243000	5245000	It doesn't have to be, it says
5245000	5247000	What was your favorite because of its twist
5247000	5249000	Or great conclusion?
5249000	5251000	I don't really know
5251000	5253000	I mean I loved all the million endings
5253000	5255000	For Chrono Trigger
5255000	5257000	That goes without saying
5257000	5259000	I loved the multiple endings for Symphony of the Night
5259000	5261000	Oh no
5261000	5263000	Richter's dead
5263000	5265000	He was controlled by Shaft
5265000	5267000	You know
5267000	5269000	I have to say that
5269000	5271000	My favorite ending
5271000	5273000	Is Maria's ending from
5273000	5275000	Dracula X
5275000	5277000	Where she's walking along with her happy
5277000	5279000	Mamba music
5279000	5281000	Her animal buddies are following her along
5281000	5283000	Yeah, because that really goes with the Castlevania
5283000	5285000	Game
5285000	5287000	Loki?
5287000	5289000	I like the ending to Final Fantasy VI
5289000	5291000	I was kind of
5291000	5293000	Going to go along those lines too
5293000	5295000	And say Final Fantasy IV was actually my favorite
5295000	5297000	Ending, it was like a 20 minute
5297000	5299000	Epic ending back in the day
5299000	5301000	Good stuff, that was one of my favorite endings
5301000	5303000	As far as like a twist
5303000	5305000	Ending, I'm trying to remember games that had like a twist
5305000	5307000	That made me go like, oh my gosh
5307000	5309000	I don't know, for some reason
5309000	5311000	I'm not thinking of any I've thought in my head right now
5311000	5313000	Plus, you have to remember I have Gamer ADD
5313000	5315000	So I don't beat a lot of video games
5315000	5317000	I play them for about an hour and then I'm like, ooh
5317000	5319000	Shiny, I'm gonna go play something else
5319000	5321000	So
5321000	5323000	But yeah, you know the Final Fantasy series is always
5323000	5325000	Dependable for good endings, I think those are
5325000	5327000	Definitely up there
5327000	5329000	So, alright
5329000	5331000	Also, I always loved the endings in
5331000	5333000	Street Fighter II
5333000	5335000	The little stories that were just so random
5335000	5337000	Always favorites of mine too
5337000	5339000	Let's see, Spazinator PSN
5339000	5341000	Says, I can't exactly say when
5341000	5343000	But hopefully if all goes well
5343000	5345000	Down the time I anticipate some
5345000	5347000	Epic news
5347000	5349000	Well, you can't just leave it at that
5349000	5351000	Say what the epic news is
5351000	5353000	Okay, Tigerclaw gives us like a ton of
5353000	5355000	Gaming links and we don't have time to
5355000	5357000	Read them all, I'm sorry, it's kind of a lot
5357000	5359000	We got a lot of Twitter topics tonight
5359000	5361000	But I'll read at least a couple of these here
5361000	5363000	Yosho Inori Ono says
5363000	5365000	Ask Capcom if you want another
5365000	5367000	Dark Stalkers game
5367000	5369000	I'm sure there's a lot of people that want to see
5369000	5371000	A new Dark Stalkers game come out
5371000	5373000	And this is an interview with Video Games
5373000	5375000	Daily during a Super Street Fighter IV
5375000	5377000	Preview in London
5377000	5379000	Yosho Inori Ono, who is the Super Street Fighter IV
5379000	5381000	Producer, he actually has said that
5381000	5383000	You know what, he wants to make a sequel to
5383000	5385000	Dark Stalkers, which of course if you've never
5385000	5387000	Played it, it was awesome, it was like a fighting game
5387000	5389000	It was like Vampires and other like
5389000	5391000	There were sequels, there were
5391000	5393000	Punches of sequels
5393000	5395000	There hasn't been one in years, you know what I mean
5395000	5397000	Just like Marvel vs Capcom, there hasn't been one in like
5397000	5399000	Ten years, so
5399000	5401000	Anyhow, he says that he always
5401000	5403000	Tries to talk about Dark Stalkers in interviews
5403000	5405000	And he wants to show Capcom that there's a
5405000	5407000	Demand for a new game, he says quote
5407000	5409000	I am desperate to make this game
5409000	5411000	That's a pretty bold statement
5411000	5413000	So you know, flood
5413000	5415000	Capcom with your letters, you know when you're
5415000	5417000	Gonna send your hate mail about their DRM
5417000	5419000	You might want to just send some
5419000	5421000	Postcards to say, oh by the way, PS New Dark
5421000	5423000	Stalkers please
5423000	5425000	But don't screw it up with DRM, don't you dare
5427000	5429000	Let's see, also I think worth mentioning here
5429000	5431000	Sony is going to be discontinuing
5431000	5433000	The three and a half inch floppy disk in
5433000	5435000	Japan, aww
5435000	5437000	Memories, aww remember
5437000	5439000	Three and a half inch floppies, we were just
5439000	5441000	Talking about them last week
5441000	5443000	They were still making them
5443000	5445000	Yeah, they still make them, at least in Japan
5445000	5447000	I want a box of them, to make something out of
5447000	5449000	Can't you still get them
5449000	5451000	In like Office Max or something?
5451000	5453000	I can actually get them at school
5453000	5455000	Maybe Dollar Tree has it
5455000	5457000	Yeah, probably Dollar Tree
5457000	5459000	Nice, yeah well unfortunately
5459000	5461000	Sony has said that in 2011
5461000	5463000	There will be no more
5463000	5465000	Three and a half inch floppy disks
5465000	5467000	Available, they were first
5467000	5469000	Introduced in 1981
5469000	5471000	And really sold abroad in Japan in
5471000	5473000	1983, they had their
5473000	5475000	Peak in the year 2000, but
5475000	5477000	As you can probably imagine
5477000	5479000	Now that you have USB drives
5479000	5481000	And CDs
5481000	5483000	And other types of storage mediums
5483000	5485000	What ever happened to zip drives?
5485000	5487000	Remember zip drives are going to be like the next big thing
5487000	5489000	I still have like three zip disks around here somewhere
5489000	5491000	I have a zip drive
5491000	5493000	Or I had a zip drive
5493000	5495000	Remember the zip drive?
5495000	5497000	That's what I used to download stuff with
5497000	5499000	I make my portable drive
5499000	5501000	So there it is, bye bye, three and a half inch floppy
5501000	5503000	It's like when they got rid of the Polaroids
5503000	5505000	Man, remember when that happened
5505000	5507000	Alright, let's see
5507000	5509000	One other one, I'll give Tigerclaw one more
5509000	5511000	Story because I'm nice and he gave a lot
5511000	5513000	He also sent us a link to a story about
5513000	5515000	Early 3D games on PS3
5515000	5517000	Featured downgraded graphics
5517000	5519000	It's a story he linked us to
5519000	5521000	On Kotaku
5521000	5523000	Well that's a whole other thing we should get into
5523000	5525000	At some point tonight, did you hear about the whole
5525000	5527000	Gawker media who owns Kotaku
5527000	5529000	One of their other little
5529000	5531000	Websites, did you hear about this whole mess about the iPhone
5531000	5533000	That was found at the bar
5533000	5535000	That bought it for like five thousand dollars
5535000	5537000	Or something like that and leaked all the information on it
5537000	5539000	And now they want it back
5539000	5541000	Well they got it back
5541000	5543000	What a mess
5543000	5545000	In pieces, right?
5545000	5547000	They probably put it back together
5547000	5549000	But yeah, that was a
5549000	5551000	Sister blog to Kotaku
5551000	5553000	Yeah, I don't know
5553000	5555000	There's more I could say on it
5555000	5557000	I'm kind of getting to the point where I just don't care
5557000	5559000	It happened, whatever
5559000	5561000	Oh my god, fourth generation
5561000	5563000	iPhone, what?
5563000	5565000	I just think the way it all went
5565000	5567000	That is so surprising
5567000	5569000	The way it all went down was a little bit
5569000	5571000	I don't know the word, I think tacky
5571000	5573000	The one that really rubbed me
5573000	5575000	The wrong way was the story they ran on
5575000	5577000	The guy who lost it
5577000	5579000	You know
5579000	5581000	How would you like that to be you?
5581000	5583000	I think we've all had that stupid ass moment
5583000	5585000	Where we left something or forgot
5585000	5587000	And it might have been important, like it might have been school work
5587000	5589000	Or you know, shit, I left my
5589000	5591000	Coke on the top of the car
5591000	5593000	And then I drove off and it flew away
5593000	5595000	But your Coke is not a prototype device
5595000	5597000	Of a highly anticipated piece of electronic
5597000	5599000	I understand
5599000	5601000	But dude had a bonehead moment
5601000	5603000	And not that it makes it right
5603000	5605000	Hey guys, look what I brought with me
5605000	5607000	I'm so drunk
5607000	5609000	Does it necessitate him being splashed
5609000	5611000	All over this blog and all the details about his Facebook
5611000	5613000	And all this stuff? It's tacky
5613000	5615000	It's just tacky
5615000	5617000	Anyway
5617000	5619000	So tacky website sister reports
5619000	5621000	That there's
5621000	5623000	The PS3 apparently
5623000	5625000	Might have some downgraded graphics
5625000	5627000	I guess Wipeout HD
5627000	5629000	It usually will run in 1080p
5629000	5631000	Which is considered, you know, it's the Uber HD
5631000	5633000	It has to actually be scaled back to
5633000	5635000	720p to run in
5635000	5637000	3D
5637000	5639000	Motorstorm, it's top resolution with 720p
5639000	5641000	It actually has to be scaled back to less than that
5641000	5643000	Which would not even be considered HD
5643000	5645000	In order to run in HD
5645000	5647000	Okay, but
5647000	5649000	That's not true
5649000	5651000	No, less than that
5651000	5653000	It's basically pulling a halo
5653000	5655000	Where, you know, they just uprise everything
5655000	5657000	But it's not true
5657000	5659000	HD
5659000	5661000	Wasn't Sony the same company that marched out there and said
5661000	5663000	We have true HD
5663000	5665000	Yeah, just like all of our games are gonna be 1080p
5665000	5667000	Running at 120 frames per second
5667000	5669000	You know
5669000	5671000	Smoke goes towards my ass
5671000	5673000	You know
5673000	5675000	Um
5675000	5677000	It's not surprising that they're gonna have to cut down
5677000	5679000	The graphics a little bit
5679000	5681000	But I don't think you're gonna really notice when everything's
5681000	5683000	Flying towards you
5683000	5685000	Um
5685000	5687000	Obviously it's gonna take more processing power to
5687000	5689000	Display, you know
5689000	5691000	Those images
5691000	5693000	It's gonna have to refresh twice as fast
5693000	5695000	Whatever
5695000	5697000	I'm so over 3D
5697000	5699000	Like, fuck 3D, seriously
5699000	5701000	I'm over it
5701000	5703000	Like, now it's just like everything
5703000	5705000	Every fucking movie's in 3D
5705000	5707000	And every game's gonna be redone in 3D
5707000	5709000	3D this, 3D that, 3DS
5709000	5711000	Fuck 3D
5711000	5713000	Fuck it
5713000	5715000	Blue Swim
5715000	5717000	You're gonna get a 3DS
5717000	5719000	Maybe
5719000	5721000	We'll see
5721000	5723000	If it hurts my eyes, I don't know
5723000	5725000	Hey, I have one, it's called a Virtual Boy
5725000	5727000	And it gave me a migraine
5727000	5729000	That says, any thoughts on the new DDR game
5729000	5731000	Coming out for the 360 later this year
5731000	5733000	That features Coldplay and Jordan Sparks
5733000	5735000	And then links us to the thing
5735000	5737000	I thought this game was coming out last year
5737000	5739000	I thought that was gonna be last year's DDR game
5739000	5741000	What happened? It got delayed?
5741000	5743000	A year?
5743000	5745000	It's not a new DDR game, it's still that last one that hasn't come out yet
5745000	5747000	The one that was at last E3
5747000	5749000	It was just
5749000	5751000	They're like, we're just gonna call it Dance Dance Revolution
5751000	5753000	Cause that's not confusing at all
5753000	5755000	Blue Swim
5755000	5757000	It's really hard to say
5757000	5759000	Until we see the game in motion
5759000	5761000	I mean, I can look at the song list
5761000	5763000	And go, meh, whatever
5763000	5765000	But I really wanna see if they finally took the advice
5765000	5767000	Of, you know, just rebuild the game from the ground up
5767000	5769000	It sounds like they might have
5769000	5771000	Because it is supposed to have all these new modes and stuff
5771000	5773000	But I'm not gonna hold my breath, let me put it that way
5773000	5775000	I'm kinda over DDR
5775000	5777000	So it's gonna take a lot to bring me back
5777000	5779000	I know that's a sad thing for me to say
5779000	5781000	But I guess
5781000	5783000	Even a new BeatMania 2DX game was announced this week
5783000	5785000	And I was just kinda like, meh
5785000	5787000	Whoopee
5787000	5789000	Whoopee
5789000	5791000	Let's see
5791000	5793000	Dark Tetsuya sends us a tweet that says
5793000	5795000	I found this on the La Mulana WiiWare blog
5795000	5797000	It's an interesting article about religion in video games
5797000	5799000	Hmm
5799000	5801000	Alright, let's see what this is all about
5801000	5803000	I'm going into the
5803000	5805000	Blog here
5805000	5807000	I have to read this whole thing?
5807000	5809000	Come on, I'm not gonna read this whole thing on air
5809000	5811000	Okay, I guess I can read some of it
5811000	5813000	Again, this is the La Mulana blog
5813000	5815000	It has to do with religion in video games
5815000	5817000	One of the difficult things when Japanese make games
5817000	5819000	For foreign countries is the problems with faith
5819000	5821000	From the historical background of Japan
5821000	5823000	The interest in faith has been weak
5823000	5825000	It's difficult to understand the feeling of things
5825000	5827000	Such as making vows with a hand over the Bible
5827000	5829000	During the presidential inauguration
5829000	5831000	Or how Islamic faith views the absolute moral
5831000	5833000	This may be obvious when you look at how
5833000	5835000	Japanese games borrow names from monsters
5835000	5837000	And items from various beliefs, civilizations, and myths
5837000	5839000	Still more
5839000	5841000	La Mulana is further created with an
5841000	5843000	Absurd theme that its roots are from
5843000	5845000	All ancient civilizations around the world
5845000	5847000	Da da da
5847000	5849000	I'd like to briefly explain the view of faith in Japan
5849000	5851000	Japan is a civilization separated from the continent
5851000	5853000	And because the land is small
5853000	5855000	There are few open fields
5855000	5857000	Japan's people have prospered by officially obtaining food
5857000	5859000	As farmers
5859000	5861000	There are many earthquakes and because of few resources
5861000	5863000	There are only a few ruins created from large stones
5863000	5865000	I believe that the sense of not wasting
5865000	5867000	Came from utilizing the limited resources
5867000	5869000	In the faith born from within the continents
5869000	5871000	Culture exists a god
5871000	5873000	Even though there is a difference between monotheism
5873000	5875000	And polytheism, thinking about the many existing
5875000	5877000	Fears, living beyond a vast
5877000	5879000	Continent and harness of nature could have brought
5879000	5881000	Forth the absolute existence
5881000	5883000	Da da da goes on to talk about the
5883000	5885000	Do not waste philosophy and so on
5885000	5887000	Meaning there is no harm
5887000	5889000	Meant when Japanese games add elements
5889000	5891000	From the beliefs of foreign countries
5891000	5893000	And it can't just end there, so what's okay and what's bad
5893000	5895000	Needs to be thought out because there's no such rule
5895000	5897000	Existing, what's the best is to have the
5897000	5899000	World's religionist check but that would not
5899000	5901000	Be possible
5901000	5903000	So it's just kind of interesting to read this blog
5903000	5905000	Kind of talking about you know these guys
5905000	5907000	Having to consider this and all the development of
5907000	5909000	La Mulana when you know
5909000	5911000	It's maybe not such a big deal in some parts of the world
5911000	5913000	But they've got to be careful not to offend
5913000	5915000	Because everything's got to be politically correct
5915000	5917000	So
5917000	5919000	If you want to check that out
5919000	5921000	La-mulana.com
5921000	5923000	Slash en for the English one
5923000	5925000	And this is called
5925000	5927000	Problem of faith and I'll link it to you
5927000	5929000	Guys in the chat but those of you listening
5929000	5931000	To the podcast La-mulana
5931000	5933000	M-u-l-a-n-a dot com
5933000	5935000	Slash en for the English version
5935000	5937000	Okay last couple
5937000	5939000	Tweets here and then we got to close up the
5939000	5941000	Twitter Alex P. Carson
5941000	5943000	On Twitter says 364 episodes
5943000	5945000	Not bad you guys are my second
5945000	5947000	Favorite podcast
5947000	5949000	Second favorite
5949000	5951000	Second favorite
5951000	5953000	Want to guess who we lose to?
5953000	5955000	Dig Nation
5955000	5957000	I know
5957000	5959000	Rob's going to have a diva stomp
5959000	5961000	We're just going to have to try harder
5961000	5963000	But he says keep up the good work
5963000	5965000	No and all joking you know whatever
5965000	5967000	I can say I've never listened to an episode of that show
5967000	5969000	So I don't know maybe they're awesome and I just don't know
5969000	5971000	It's well Kevin
5971000	5973000	Yeah I know who's on it but does that make me care anymore?
5973000	5975000	No
5975000	5977000	Well because it's a translate thing
5977000	5979000	It's like a Google translate
5979000	5981000	Okay I hope that's all it is just because
5981000	5983000	It's just kerned badly
5983000	5985000	Well the Japanese it's developed by Japanese
5985000	5987000	Obviously so you know it's just
5987000	5989000	Probably run through the Google translate
5989000	5991000	Yeah and then
5991000	5993000	Spazinator sends a last tweet
5993000	5995000	Saying sorry I'm nixing the epic news
5995000	5997000	Oh well how do you
5997000	5999000	I know something you don't know never mind
6001000	6003000	Whatever
6003000	6005000	Let's move on with some more gaming news
6005000	6007000	Then we're going to get to our Skype line a little later in the show
6007000	6009000	1877 game OLR
6009000	6011000	Not yet we've got some more gaming news
6011000	6013000	Mailbag and all that fun stuff
6013000	6015000	Logie why don't you get us back to gaming news
6015000	6017000	Ah yes well
6017000	6019000	One of the things that was announced
6019000	6021000	I want to say Tokyo Game Show

6023000	6025000	For Dead Rising 2 they're going to be
6025000	6027000	Doing some sort of
6027000	6029000	Different things
6029000	6031000	Other than the last game of course
6031000	6033000	One of them being co-op in the game
6033000	6035000	And in fact they are
6035000	6037000	Going to allow you to play through the entire
6037000	6039000	Single player campaign with
6039000	6041000	Another person
6041000	6043000	Which is awesome
6043000	6045000	And really the way they should have done it in the first place
6045000	6047000	Um
6047000	6049000	And then also
6049000	6051000	Let's see here
6051000	6053000	Oh great and then that disappeared
6053000	6055000	For some reason go Comcast
6055000	6057000	Um
6057000	6059000	Now the other player that you play
6059000	6061000	As I'm not sure if it's um
6061000	6063000	I guess it's a clone of your own character
6063000	6065000	I mean they're both Chuck Green
6065000	6067000	Not some other character
6067000	6069000	That you play as but um
6069000	6071000	It's going to be pretty awesome and they're
6071000	6073000	Going to have some different mini games you can play as well
6073000	6075000	Um
6075000	6077000	I want to say there's like card playing
6077000	6079000	And
6079000	6081000	Different events and stuff that you can do
6081000	6083000	But hey
6083000	6085000	That's pretty sweet that they're going to have something other than
6085000	6087000	Just like that Deathmatch
6087000	6089000	American gladiator-esque
6089000	6091000	Mode in the game
6091000	6093000	Yeah I got to admit co-op sounds kind of rad
6093000	6095000	So I'm looking forward to that
6095000	6097000	Yeah so um
6097000	6099000	One of the other things I saw too
6099000	6101000	Um
6101000	6103000	Was that they were talking a little bit about
6103000	6105000	The
6105000	6107000	Demo slash prequel game
6107000	6109000	That they're going to be putting out
6109000	6111000	Um the
6111000	6113000	I want to say what was it called
6113000	6115000	I can't remember
6115000	6117000	Anyways um
6117000	6119000	That should be coming out
6119000	6121000	Pretty soon I would think because I think
6121000	6123000	Dead Rising 2 if I remember correctly
6123000	6125000	Is scheduled for August right now
6125000	6127000	Well
6127000	6129000	Right now but you know we just heard
6129000	6131000	About a bunch of other games getting pushed back
6131000	6133000	So maybe these games will get pushed back too
6133000	6135000	Yeah
6135000	6137000	Maybe but Capcom usually doesn't move stuff around too much
6137000	6139000	We'll see what happens
6139000	6141000	God I just can't wait to play the game though
6141000	6143000	Yeah the more and more
6143000	6145000	I'm hearing about it the more it sounds kind of awesome
6145000	6147000	Even if Frank West isn't in it after all
6147000	6149000	Well
6149000	6151000	It would be funny if he made a cameo
6151000	6153000	I mean you never know
6153000	6155000	They're saying that he's not in it now
6155000	6157000	But I mean
6157000	6159000	You know
6159000	6161000	Might be funny if he has some big role in it
6161000	6163000	Or something later on
6163000	6165000	Well a new trailer also was released
6165000	6167000	Out of the Capcom press event that was pretty much
6167000	6169000	Already spoiled on last week's show
6169000	6171000	One of the things that came out was a trailer
6171000	6173000	For Bionic Commando Re-Arm 2
6173000	6175000	Oh awesome
6175000	6177000	And there's that little
6177000	6179000	That's right
6179000	6181000	It's redesigned and it's rebuilt
6181000	6185000	And I guess the big thing now is that
6185000	6187000	He can actually like jump
6187000	6189000	Now
6189000	6191000	Well that takes up the point
6191000	6193000	Yeah so now he can jump and use the arm
6193000	6195000	So there it is
6195000	6197000	That's the big change in Bionic Commando
6197000	6199000	Re-Arm 2
6199000	6201000	It will be on Playstation Network and Xbox Live
6201000	6203000	The first quarter of 2011
6203000	6205000	New weapons, attacks and all that
6205000	6207000	Fun stuff
6207000	6209000	It's being developed by Fat Shark
6209000	6211000	Because you know Grin did the first one right
6211000	6213000	And they're not there anymore
6213000	6215000	New physics based puzzles
6215000	6217000	There will actually be a two player co-op in this game as well
6217000	6219000	New graphics, new score
6219000	6221000	But it will be inspired by NES
6221000	6223000	Which kind of brings me back to
6223000	6225000	What makes this game very interesting in the first place
6225000	6227000	Bionic Commando Re-Armed was an upgrade
6227000	6229000	Of an actual NES game that existed
6229000	6231000	Called Bionic Commando
6231000	6233000	So this is a sequel to a
6233000	6235000	Retro remake
6235000	6237000	That isn't based off anything
6237000	6239000	Isn't that weird?
6239000	6241000	I don't know if it's not based off anything
6241000	6243000	Some of the stuff reminded me of the arcade game
6243000	6245000	Of Bionic Commando
6245000	6247000	Wasn't there a rumored sequel in development too
6247000	6249000	That just didn't end up happening
6249000	6251000	I want to say I'd read a while ago that there was a rumored
6251000	6253000	Sequel in development so maybe some of this is bits and pieces
6253000	6255000	But still the point remains
6255000	6257000	You have a sequel to a retro game
6257000	6259000	That doesn't actually exist
6259000	6261000	Which I find very interesting
6261000	6263000	In a way
6263000	6265000	But it's still got that same art style and everything
6265000	6267000	And despite the jumping
6267000	6269000	Kind of being
6269000	6271000	Huh? For Bionic Commando
6271000	6273000	I guess it could be cool
6273000	6275000	And remember how I was saying too
6275000	6277000	About the release date
6277000	6279000	For Dead Rising 2
6279000	6281000	They're also showing as August 31st
6281000	6283000	On
6283000	6285000	I guess this is news coming from
6285000	6287000	X10
6287000	6289000	Hmm
6289000	6291000	Just in time for the end of
6291000	6293000	Summer and Labor Day. Good stuff
6293000	6295000	Alright
6295000	6297000	Anyway that's Bionic Commando re-armed too
6297000	6299000	And look for more news on that
6299000	6301000	As we get closer to the first half of 2011
6301000	6303000	Dark Soccer
6303000	6305000	Well
6305000	6307000	This is some good news and actually the screen
6307000	6309000	Capture is in French
6309000	6311000	But there is a
6311000	6313000	Screen capture that was submitted
6313000	6315000	That shows a particular game
6315000	6317000	For Xbox Live Arcade
6317000	6319000	And that would be Jet Set Radio
6319000	6321000	Um
6321000	6323000	It could be
6323000	6325000	It could not be. It could have just been a
6325000	6327000	Place holder by someone wanting to
6327000	6329000	You know cause
6329000	6331000	Sonic 4 Episode 1 is on the list
6331000	6333000	And you know
6333000	6335000	But other stuff like Quake Arena arcades
6335000	6337000	You know Clash. That's real. Yeah
6337000	6339000	So it's real? Yeah it's real. It's off of
6339000	6341000	That's the
6341000	6343000	Partner net stuff
6343000	6345000	Some of which has already been leaking online
6345000	6347000	And they're cracking down on it pretty big
6347000	6349000	Yeah I was like it's in French
6349000	6351000	No it's the same guys
6351000	6353000	That released information
6353000	6355000	Well I'm not sure if it's the same person but
6355000	6357000	Those same games were on
6357000	6359000	Had screenshots leaked out because someone has a
6359000	6361000	Dev kit that they bought
6361000	6363000	And they're releasing a bunch of screenshots
6363000	6365000	And stuff from games that haven't been
6365000	6367000	Announced yet or aren't released yet
6367000	6369000	And stuff like that and then
6369000	6371000	A few of them they actually leaked out the full
6371000	6373000	Games out there
6373000	6375000	So
6375000	6377000	Yeah but
6377000	6379000	People keep going ok
6379000	6381000	Release
6381000	6383000	Sonic 4 come on come on
6383000	6385000	You know you want it and they're like no because
6385000	6387000	They're cracking down on it and now they're password protecting
6387000	6389000	A bunch of this stuff and
6389000	6391000	They don't like that too much
6391000	6393000	Well I mean I can imagine
6393000	6395000	But well yeah it's not meant for that kind of stuff
6395000	6397000	Um
6397000	6399000	Dev kits getting
6399000	6401000	Sold to
6401000	6403000	Random people
6403000	6405000	Aren't those things expensive aren't they like ten thousand dollars
6405000	6407000	To get one of those kits? No
6407000	6409000	No cheaper than that? A lot less than that
6409000	6411000	Really? Yeah
6411000	6413000	How much would it cost for me to get one?
6413000	6415000	A dev kit? About a thousand bucks
6415000	6417000	I want a dev kit
6417000	6419000	A thousand bucks I'm not sure if that includes
6419000	6421000	The ability to log into Partner net or not
6421000	6423000	Um
6423000	6425000	I don't know what exactly that takes but
6425000	6427000	You can find them
6427000	6429000	But you know now that there's JTAG
6429000	6431000	Consoles out there you don't really need dev kits anymore
6431000	6433000	Yeah but a JTAG console
6433000	6435000	Can't get on Partner net and get all the details
6435000	6437000	About games that are coming out you know what I mean? That's true
6437000	6439000	But there's other people that can do that for you
6439000	6441000	Alright
6441000	6443000	Um
6443000	6445000	Let's move on with some more news
6445000	6447000	Loki
6447000	6449000	Ah yes um
6449000	6451000	Now there's some other interesting
6451000	6453000	Stuff um coming out from
6453000	6455000	The Captivate stuff
6455000	6457000	Including you know these are some
6457000	6459000	Games that I believe were already out in
6459000	6461000	Japan that are making their way out over here
6461000	6463000	Um Okameden
6463000	6465000	Is coming out on the DS
6465000	6467000	Later this year or actually I'm sorry
6467000	6469000	Uh 2011
6469000	6471000	And of course that's the sequel to Okami
6471000	6473000	Um
6473000	6475000	And it looks pretty awesome
6475000	6477000	And then of course um
6477000	6479000	You mean Legend of
6479000	6481000	Okami? Legend of Okami
6481000	6483000	Alright
6483000	6485000	And then um
6485000	6487000	From the same I'm not sure
6487000	6489000	If it's the creators of the
6489000	6491000	Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney
6491000	6493000	Series but at least the same
6493000	6495000	Artists um they're releasing Ghost
6495000	6497000	Trick Phantom Detective
6497000	6499000	Um that's going to be a brand new series
6499000	6501000	And that's supposed to be making its way out
6501000	6503000	Later this year
6503000	6505000	And then oddly enough on the Wii and
6505000	6507000	The PS3 Sengoku
6507000	6509000	Basara Samurai Heroes is making
6509000	6511000	Its way out and I believe that's supposed to be
6511000	6513000	Later this year
6513000	6515000	Um
6515000	6517000	And that one uh came out
6517000	6519000	Well one of the games in the
6519000	6521000	Series came out on the Playstation 2
6521000	6523000	A couple of years back um
6523000	6525000	Which was uh
6525000	6527000	God I just had the name
6527000	6529000	Devil uh
6529000	6531000	Devil Hunter I think
6531000	6533000	I
6533000	6535000	I don't remember but I thought that was the
6535000	6537000	Name of the series that came out over
6537000	6539000	Here it's basically like uh
6539000	6541000	Dynasty Warriors
6541000	6543000	Both guns
6543000	6545000	Cool guns
6545000	6547000	Yeah not really though I hate guns
6547000	6549000	They've had um
6549000	6551000	At least one other Sengoku Basara game
6551000	6553000	That was um
6553000	6555000	Basara I guess game that was on
6555000	6557000	The Wii
6557000	6559000	A while back I want to say it was the first
6559000	6563000	Second year the Wii was out
6563000	6565000	But they're okay they're kind of cool
6565000	6567000	I don't know
6567000	6569000	I just wish they was on the 360 too
6569000	6571000	I just don't understand why they hate
6571000	6573000	Unless it's going to be coming out
6573000	6575000	At a time when they do have the motion controller
6575000	6577000	In play and it's
6577000	6579000	Going to be something with that and then maybe I can
6579000	6581000	Understand why it's on the Wii and the PS3
6581000	6583000	Other than that it's just hating
6583000	6585000	They're just hateful
6585000	6587000	Why they hate?
6587000	6589000	Don't hate the play I hate the game
6589000	6591000	Anyhow
6591000	6593000	This is a game that I
6593000	6595000	Tried to like but it kind of
6595000	6597000	Drove me bonkers but we had a little tidbit
6597000	6599000	On it last week it's the Lord of Ultima
6599000	6601000	And it was actually released this week
6601000	6603000	Yay it was launched and you can actually
6603000	6605000	Play it and have fun with it
6605000	6607000	You have to visit the website which was
6607000	6609000	I think it was like lordofultima.com
6609000	6611000	You can actually go and play the game
6611000	6613000	I tried to play it and it crashed on me
6613000	6615000	During the tutorial
6615000	6617000	So uh yeah
6617000	6619000	But apparently in this game you will
6619000	6621000	Set up your own little kingdom and there's little micro
6621000	6623000	Transactions and stuff I don't know it sounds
6623000	6625000	A little Farmville to me but with Ultima
6625000	6627000	And you know better
6627000	6629000	Graphics and all that stuff but I tried to
6629000	6631000	Play it I wanted to review it for you guys but it crashed
6631000	6633000	During the tutorial so I guess I'll have to try again this week
6633000	6635000	Is any of our listeners playing? Chatters does anyone
6635000	6637000	Try Lord of Ultima that came out this week?
6637000	6639000	Anybody?
6639000	6641000	Maybe we can have a guild?
6641000	6643000	Or a kingdom or
6643000	6645000	Something?
6645000	6647000	I don't know. Alright let's get to the part of the show
6647000	6649000	Where you guys get to write us and have your say
6649000	6651000	It's our mailbag segment
6651000	6653000	Mailbag

6655000	6657000	Those emails. DarkSakura
6657000	6659000	Who's emailing us this week?
6659000	6661000	Two people
6661000	6663000	We're drowning in letters
6663000	6665000	Redertainment
6665000	6667000	Dear OLR I sent you
6667000	6669000	A Twitter topic last week asking why
6669000	6671000	Activision had not set up their own bank
6671000	6673000	I was not joking about that
6673000	6675000	I was in fact serious
6675000	6677000	What got me thinking was
6677000	6679000	About this was Walmart's effort to create their own bank
6679000	6681000	They wanted to lower the prices
6681000	6683000	Of check and credit card processing by
6683000	6685000	Cutting out the middle man in this process
6685000	6687000	Walmart wanted to establish this bank
6687000	6689000	In the mediocre state of Utah
6689000	6691000	Which is how I came to learn about it
6691000	6693000	Ultimately the banking lobbies in Utah put the kibosh
6693000	6695000	On this deal and the effort
6695000	6697000	Ultimately died
6697000	6699000	Activists establishing their own bank assembly lowered
6699000	6701000	Processing fees for people playing wow
6701000	6703000	And also act as an additional
6703000	6705000	Revenue stream for Activision as if they
6705000	6707000	Need another
6707000	6709000	I'm not saying this would be good for the consumer
6709000	6711000	The bank of Activision would inevitably
6711000	6713000	Church bank customers out the ass for bank fees
6713000	6715000	Jack up interest rates on loans and quickly foreclose
6715000	6717000	On the homes of people who were delinquent on payments
6717000	6719000	These deplorable practices
6719000	6721000	Would happen because Activision seems only interested
6721000	6723000	In squeezing all the cash they can
6723000	6725000	Out of consumers and not serving their customers
6725000	6727000	Well like most major banks do today
6727000	6729000	I'm not going to say anything
6729000	6731000	I work in the mortgage industry
6731000	6733000	So is there a legal reason why Activision
6733000	6735000	Has not established their own bank
6735000	6737000	Or is this whole rant evidence
6737000	6739000	Of my low opinion of the banking industry
6739000	6741000	In America and of Activision
6741000	6743000	Stay care of entertainment
6743000	6745000	This message is brought to you by the Burns Cafe
6745000	6747000	In Taylorsville, Utah where thanks to their choice
6747000	6749000	And the meat they serve you can literally bite an ass
6749000	6751000	Well it's a bummer you couldn't fit that
6751000	6753000	In 140 characters or less
6753000	6755000	Or the tweet might have made more sense at the time
6755000	6757000	Ok I get your joke now lol
6759000	6761000	I don't know, Activision is not going to set up a bank
6761000	6763000	Like they care
6763000	6765000	I get the point you're trying to make
6765000	6767000	But come on
6767000	6769000	It's cute though
6769000	6771000	Your email was cute
6771000	6773000	Your thought is cute I like that
6773000	6775000	Oh this is one we've been included on
6775000	6777000	How nice
6777000	6779000	From Brandon
6779000	6781000	Dear C4 and OLR crew
6781000	6783000	I got DDR U3
6783000	6785000	With a soft pad
6785000	6787000	And I want some modding help
6787000	6789000	To make it a hard pad
6789000	6791000	I want to know why you hate or have not played
6791000	6793000	Beat and Groovy
6793000	6795000	That's up to you Rob
6795000	6797000	In my mind it was Pop'n Music for the 360
6797000	6799000	As far as superior
6799000	6801000	God please spell
6801000	6803000	Than Pop'n on the Wii
6803000	6805000	I have a suggestion for Konami
6805000	6807000	If they are going to do Pop'n Music Wii V2
6807000	6809000	They should take the normal Pop'n controller
6809000	6811000	And have a slot in it for the Wii remote
6811000	6813000	Oh God please
6813000	6815000	This is just awful
6815000	6817000	I'm looking for some fun RPGs for the 360 help
6817000	6819000	That's literally how it said
6819000	6821000	I am looking for fun RPGs
6821000	6823000	For the 360 help
6823000	6825000	Was this typed on an iPhone?
6825000	6827000	I can type better than this on an iPhone Rob
6827000	6829000	And besides that iPhones
6829000	6831000	Auto capitalize and fix your spelling
6831000	6833000	Whoever accepted my PA challenge
6833000	6835000	Should know
6835000	6837000	That I only have
6837000	6839000	SM and DDR US3
6839000	6841000	And I am looking for an online
6841000	6843000	Challenge on Live since the
6843000	6845000	Hourly DS Master 26
6845000	6847000	PS I want to find a cop
6847000	6849000	That explains a lot
6849000	6851000	It's with two Ps
6851000	6853000	Of Disney Mix for PS1 and Golden Eye Clone for today's
6853000	6855000	Consoles
6855000	6857000	I have Disney Mix, I have both of them
6857000	6859000	I have the Japanese one and the US one and you can't have it
6859000	6861000	Oops, the FU's music
6861000	6863000	How appropriate that the FU's music accidentally
6863000	6865000	Starts playing
6865000	6867000	I didn't do that intentionally I swear
6867000	6869000	God there was like five questions in that email
6869000	6871000	What was the first question?
6871000	6873000	I just stopped paying attention
6873000	6875000	I was just reading the words
6875000	6877000	Can you go back and look for me?
6877000	6879000	I closed it
6879000	6881000	SSJ100Matt said that this email
6881000	6883000	Fails too many fucking ways
6883000	6885000	Okay
6885000	6887000	You want to know how to mod a soft pad
6887000	6889000	Look online
6889000	6891000	The way that I know how to do it
6891000	6893000	Duct tape it to a piece of plywood
6893000	6895000	Seriously? It works?
6895000	6897000	Oh yeah, packaging tape
6897000	6899000	Do not do the sheet of plastic over it
6899000	6901000	Because you'll fall
6901000	6903000	I'm sorry, not that
6903000	6905000	You need to get a clear linoleum
6905000	6907000	Or whatever and you put that over the top
6907000	6909000	And then you staple it through the bottom
6909000	6911000	With a staple gun
6911000	6913000	But yes, look online
6913000	6915000	You can also use a power drill
6915000	6917000	And screws
6917000	6919000	Although he'd probably screw his foot
6919000	6921000	I think
6921000	6923000	Because he wouldn't be able to read the instructions
6923000	6925000	DS Master's just not allowed to
6925000	6927000	Email us unless it's been
6927000	6929000	Spell checked and grammar checked
6929000	6931000	Well, you know, Bobby's in chat and says
6931000	6933000	You know he does this on purpose, right?
6933000	6935000	The only way to stop it is to not even bother
6935000	6937000	That's what I did, don't give him the attention
6937000	6939000	That's actually what I was just about to say
6939000	6941000	I'm going to stop reading emails from him
6941000	6943000	Unless they're typed properly
6943000	6945000	That's fair
6945000	6947000	You need to have somebody proofread it
6947000	6949000	And then we might read them
6949000	6951000	Might!
6951000	6953000	RPGs on the 360
6953000	6955000	Final Fantasy 13
6955000	6957000	Is good
6957000	6959000	I guess a lot of people like to
6959000	6961000	Even though I did not
6961000	6963000	Okay, whatever
6963000	6965000	Lost Odyssey, yes, thank you
6965000	6967000	Blue Dragon's okay
6967000	6969000	I love Blue Dragon
6969000	6971000	Bite my butt
6971000	6973000	I will give Blue Dragon this
6973000	6975000	If you liked the Super Nintendo RPGs
6975000	6977000	It's very retro-esque
6977000	6979000	Blue Dragon should have just been on the Super Nintendo
6979000	6981000	Blue Dragon reminds me of playing a Dreamcast RPG
6981000	6983000	End of story
6983000	6985000	It's like playing Evolution
6985000	6987000	Oh, I remember the other one
6987000	6989000	I was like, what the hell are you smoking?
6989000	6991000	Beat and Groovy, it's just not a good game
6991000	6993000	Beat and Groovy is unfinished
6993000	6995000	It's an unfinished pile of poop
6995000	6997000	That Konami put on the arcade
6997000	6999000	That honestly Microsoft should have rejected
6999000	7001000	Like, it's a horrible
7001000	7003000	Abortion of a game
7003000	7005000	It's literally, I'm not saying that to be
7005000	7007000	It is literally an abortion
7007000	7009000	It was stopped
7009000	7011000	Halfway through it was actually finished
7011000	7013000	And put on the marketplace
7013000	7015000	You have like up to nine star
7015000	7017000	Difficulties on songs that are never used
7017000	7019000	There's no song on there that's harder than like
7019000	7021000	A five star difficulty
7021000	7023000	The song list is laughable
7023000	7025000	There was no download content or anything
7025000	7027000	Released, it is a bad
7027000	7029000	Unfinished, aborted game
7029000	7031000	Beat and Groovy
7031000	7033000	Do not buy it, I'm not even
7033000	7035000	Kidding, don't support that crap
7035000	7037000	I'm gonna put out another pop of music
7037000	7039000	Cause I'm guessing one, the Wii one
7039000	7041000	Did not sell very well
7041000	7043000	Two, Konami doesn't really
7043000	7045000	Get the Wii and stuff
7045000	7047000	Other than rehashing DDR
7047000	7049000	And putting stuff out there
7049000	7051000	And adding some waggle crap to it
7051000	7053000	I mean, that's really the most
7053000	7055000	Effort you get from Konami
7055000	7057000	With some of these games
7057000	7059000	So no, they're not gonna spend the time
7059000	7061000	To make a peripheral for pop of music
7061000	7063000	Because it just will never catch on over here
7063000	7065000	I'll say this, at least the game had a couple
7065000	7067000	Okay songs, like the song list
7067000	7069000	Wasn't completely fail, but
7069000	7071000	I'm sorry, you know, you put a
7071000	7073000	Poop in sparkly, pretty packaging
7073000	7075000	And it's still poop
7075000	7077000	Pop of music is very niche
7077000	7079000	In Japan, so
7079000	7081000	Why would you bring something that's
7081000	7083000	Incredibly
7083000	7085000	Niche over here
7085000	7087000	Just fucking fail at it
7087000	7089000	I understand wanting to bring the niche thing over here
7089000	7091000	If you do a good job with it
7091000	7093000	That, I mean, was set up for
7093000	7095000	Failure from the beginning
7095000	7097000	Honestly, I'm throwing this out here
7097000	7099000	Whoever is responsible for that game
7099000	7101000	Should have been fired
7101000	7103000	Like, I'm not even kidding, whoever was responsible for that
7103000	7105000	Fire them
7105000	7107000	That was
7107000	7109000	Unexcusable, that game
7109000	7111000	Period
7111000	7113000	Alright
7113000	7115000	What are you giggling at over there, Dark Sakura?
7115000	7117000	Are you even paying attention
7117000	7119000	To the show?
7119000	7121000	I just was distracted by something
7121000	7123000	And I found a link to a product
7123000	7125000	Called HanderPants
7125000	7127000	Underpants for your hands
7127000	7129000	HanderPants?
7129000	7131000	Why on earth would you need HanderPants?
7131000	7133000	I don't know
7133000	7135000	I just think it's funny
7135000	7137000	They're fingerless gloves
7137000	7139000	With the design of underwear
7139000	7141000	I'm gonna link it into the chatroom
7141000	7143000	Jesus
7143000	7145000	This is the same vein as Mantis
7145000	7147000	And then you go up to somebody
7147000	7149000	And you're like, look at my Mantis pants
7149000	7151000	Look at my HanderPants
7151000	7153000	I don't care
7153000	7155000	Really, I don't
7155000	7157000	Look at my Mantis
7157000	7159000	Your Mantis?
7159000	7161000	What?
7161000	7163000	It's a real website, Mantis.com
7163000	7165000	I know, I'm sure it is
7165000	7167000	But see, there's people that are into that
7167000	7169000	But like, HanderPants, that
7169000	7171000	I don't understand
7171000	7173000	There's some guys that wanna
7173000	7175000	You know, the
7175000	7177000	Sorry, Sakura
7177000	7179000	Why are you doing this?
7179000	7181000	I
7181000	7183000	I am so easily distracted
7183000	7185000	today. Oh, it's not funny
7185000	7187000	Mantis
7187000	7189000	SSJ100Matt says this topic sounds
7189000	7191000	Automatically better than dsmaster's email
7191000	7193000	You know what's funny? We didn't even finish with his
7193000	7195000	Email, we just went right on to talking about Mantis
7195000	7197000	And I'm enjoying myself more than I was
7197000	7199000	Five minutes ago
7199000	7201000	Just
7201000	7203000	You know what?
7203000	7205000	I think that should be the rule from now on
7205000	7207000	The rule
7207000	7209000	No, I have it
7209000	7211000	I have a new OLR rule
7211000	7213000	Could you please get out the stone tablets
7213000	7215000	And get out the chisel
7215000	7217000	Cause they're gonna write a new rule
7217000	7219000	When you send us a question
7219000	7221000	To the mailbag
7221000	7223000	And it is so horribly tight
7223000	7225000	And grammar
7225000	7227000	Look, if you make a couple mistakes here and there
7227000	7229000	I'm not the best with spelling and grammar either
7229000	7231000	But at least if you put out an effort, we're not gonna laugh at you
7231000	7233000	At least you're consistent
7233000	7235000	If you just have a
7235000	7237000	Horrible email that you didn't even bother
7237000	7239000	To try with and you typed it like it was a
7239000	7241000	Text message on the cell phone
7241000	7243000	We are going to answer your question
7243000	7245000	With Mantis.net
7245000	7247000	Is the website you need to go
7247000	7249000	To fix your problem
7249000	7251000	From now on
7251000	7253000	Or possibly hand or pants
7253000	7255000	When you send us a question that stinks
7255000	7257000	Mantis.net is where you need
7257000	7259000	To go to find your answer
7259000	7261000	Try the high cut ones
7261000	7263000	Put that on the wiki
7263000	7265000	It's an official rule
7265000	7267000	Alright
7267000	7269000	Hey, whoever updates their wiki, add it
7269000	7271000	Let's go to the
7271000	7273000	I like
7273000	7275000	Game suggestion
7275000	7277000	RPG 360
7277000	7279000	Well email her, I think you'll find the answer
7279000	7281000	At Mantis.net
7281000	7283000	Alright
7283000	7285000	Speaking of which
7285000	7287000	These things have flies
7287000	7289000	Rob, they do have
7289000	7291000	Embroidered briefs
7291000	7293000	You're telling me this like I would want to suddenly
7293000	7295000	Go over them? I don't want you to get any
7295000	7297000	I'm just saying that they're funny
7297000	7299000	Let's get to the FUs
7313000	7315000	FU to
7315000	7317000	DS Masters email
7317000	7319000	And now you know what
7319000	7321000	I think the rule is just I'm just not answering any more
7321000	7323000	From them, ever
7323000	7325000	Lowkey
7325000	7327000	FU to bad drivers
7327000	7329000	Two types in particular
7329000	7331000	One, the person that
7331000	7333000	Decides hey you know it's going to be a great idea
7333000	7335000	To stop four car lengths before the car
7335000	7337000	That's in front of them
7337000	7339000	Making it near impossible to go around them
7339000	7341000	Or the fact that they go really slow
7341000	7343000	To accelerate once the light does change
7343000	7345000	And then two
7345000	7347000	The more dangerous type, the people that run
7347000	7349000	Stop signs and run stop lights
7349000	7351000	They're there
7351000	7353000	For safety and the fact that you
7353000	7355000	Just blow right through them like you don't give
7355000	7357000	A shit, that's how people die
7357000	7359000	So, stop it
7359000	7361000	Cause I don't want to die
7363000	7365000	Um, I'm sorry I'm laughing too hard
7365000	7367000	Cause I'm looking at this website
7367000	7369000	I don't really have a lot of FUs
7369000	7371000	Of the week
7371000	7373000	Actually I had a pretty good week
7373000	7375000	I really don't think I had a lot of bad things
7375000	7377000	Happen, I guess FU to those work
7377000	7379000	Days that start at 6 AM
7379000	7381000	Cause getting up at 5 o'clock to go to work
7381000	7383000	Kinda stinks, but at least the days go by fast
7383000	7385000	So, even that's not really a complaint
7385000	7387000	Alright, let's get to some more
7387000	7389000	Gaming news and then
7389000	7391000	We'll open up the skype line at 1877
7391000	7393000	Game OLR and who knows
7393000	7395000	What phone calls we might get tonight
7395000	7397000	Uh, Lowkey
7397000	7399000	Yes, so you know
7399000	7401000	The whole drama with Infinity Ward
7401000	7403000	And Activision is just nuts
7403000	7405000	Activision, they've hired
7405000	7407000	A person to, I guess
7407000	7409000	Run their community forum
7409000	7411000	Or whatever, Dan
7411000	7413000	Amrich
7413000	7415000	And I guess they have a Facebook
7415000	7417000	Cause everybody does
7417000	7419000	And he's basically
7419000	7421000	Trying to give their side
7421000	7423000	I guess of the whole bonus situation
7423000	7425000	For Infinity Ward
7425000	7427000	Um, he says
7427000	7429000	Vince and Jason had very
7429000	7431000	Large bonuses, those bonuses are being
7431000	7433000	Redistributed to everyone else
7433000	7435000	To people who did not allegedly
7435000	7437000	Attempt to steal company secrets
7437000	7439000	Activision
7439000	7441000	Is not pocketing the bonus money
7441000	7443000	It's still going to the people who
7443000	7445000	Work at Infinity Ward
7445000	7447000	But you have to work at Infinity
7447000	7449000	Ward to get it
7449000	7451000	See, I don't want
7451000	7453000	To see talented people screwed out
7453000	7457000	Of a paycheck any more than you do
7457000	7459000	So are they trying to be all like
7459000	7461000	Hey, we're the good guys, we're gonna pay out those bonuses
7461000	7463000	No, we're gonna pay them, we're gonna pay them
7463000	7465000	Don't worry, they're getting a bigger share of the bonus
7465000	7467000	Well, why don't you pay their bonuses in the first place
7467000	7469000	Because that was the whole problem
7469000	7471000	You weren't paying the bonuses
7471000	7473000	What, the game's been out for
7473000	7475000	Almost
7475000	7477000	Six months now?
7477000	7479000	What's it like to get a bonus?
7479000	7481000	Isn't it time to get the bonuses
7481000	7483000	Out there?
7483000	7485000	I thought bonuses were just that, a bonus
7485000	7487000	Allegedly, why didn't you even put the allegedly
7487000	7489000	Attempt to steal company secrets
7489000	7491000	They're the ones that made the game
7491000	7493000	I think all their secrets are in their head
7493000	7495000	They don't need to steal anything
7497000	7499000	He's just a douche
7499000	7501000	You know, unfortunately
7501000	7503000	He's sub douche, you know, to the major douche
7503000	7505000	Which
7505000	7507000	Why even bother having a community?
7507000	7509000	I think this is the same guy I want to say
7509000	7511000	Like, why do you hate Activision
7511000	7513000	Or whatever, we want your honest answers
7513000	7515000	Or something like that
7515000	7517000	It's like, really, you don't know why we don't like you
7517000	7519000	I mean, really, you have to ask
7519000	7521000	That's like my wife
7521000	7523000	You know, if like, she's mad at me
7523000	7525000	And I'm like, what are you mad at me for?
7525000	7527000	And she's like, really, you don't know
7527000	7529000	That just makes me even more pissed off
7529000	7531000	It's because we expect our spouses to be
7531000	7533000	Psychic when we're psychotic
7533000	7537000	I'm letting the secret out of the bag
7537000	7540000	Ooh, you're gonna get nasty emails from the women of America?
7540000	7542000	I'm a chick!
7542000	7544000	The women of America don't listen to our show
7544000	7546000	I can get away with saying this
7546000	7548000	Because it's exactly what I pull with my husband
7548000	7550000	Wait, Dan, you didn't hear that?
7553000	7555000	Uh, yeah
7555000	7557000	It says, uh, although it's unclear
7557000	7559000	Whether the Romanian Infinity War
7559000	7561000	Employees have received their personal bonuses
7561000	7563000	For Modern Warfare 2 yet
7563000	7565000	Activision lawsuit claims that
7565000	7567000	Zampanelli and Wes
7567000	7569000	Allocated to, or, and Wes
7569000	7571000	Allocated to themselves approximately
7571000	7573000	One third of the total bonus pool
7573000	7575000	For the Call of Duty franchise bonuses
7575000	7577000	Which included
7577000	7579000	The first Modern Warfare game
7579000	7581000	Further, it contends that Wes and
7581000	7583000	Zampella, um
7583000	7585000	Were demanding an even larger
7585000	7587000	Share of the bonus pool for Modern Warfare 2
7587000	7589000	Oh, so now
7589000	7591000	We're seeing that they're getting too big bonus
7591000	7593000	Or too much of a bonus or whatever
7593000	7595000	If they wanted too much of a bonus
7595000	7597000	Well, that's too bad that they got fired
7597000	7599000	So that really doesn't make any sense
7601000	7603000	Uh, and
7603000	7605000	No word on when this whole thing
7605000	7607000	Is gonna be taken care of, but
7607000	7609000	They're thinking that more people are gonna leave
7609000	7611000	So, uh
7613000	7615000	Oh, and they have a big ol' quote for
7615000	7617000	Activision's countersuit, which I don't really feel like
7617000	7619000	Reading, cause it's just a bunch of
7619000	7621000	Crap
7621000	7623000	In my opinion
7623000	7625000	Ipsofacto
7625000	7627000	Sue
7627000	7629000	Money
7629000	7631000	Let's move on then, shall we?
7631000	7633000	One more story for you guys, then I guess we'll open up
7633000	7635000	The skyfly and see what happens
7635000	7637000	Could be a fun time tonight
7637000	7639000	877 Game OLR
7639000	7641000	Oh, I forgot to mention real quick
7641000	7643000	This kind of goes along with this story, but
7643000	7645000	It is apparently rumored
7645000	7647000	Or, I don't know if it's confirmed or rumored
7647000	7649000	But, uh, they're saying that
7649000	7651000	Modern Warfare 2 games are gonna be out
7651000	7653000	Uh, by 2011
7653000	7655000	Or, 3, not Modern Warfare
7655000	7657000	Uh, 3 Call of Duty
7657000	7659000	Games will be out
7659000	7661000	Good luck, guys
7661000	7663000	Good luck. Well, these other games
7663000	7665000	Might be out soon. It's more website
7665000	7667000	Leaks. Remember earlier in the show we had a
7667000	7669000	News about Farmville and some apparent
7669000	7671000	Websites that were being registered that gave away Farmville
7671000	7673000	On other platforms. Well, something similar is kinda
7673000	7675000	Happening, but it has to do with some different games
7675000	7677000	Like games that people actually play
7677000	7679000	Here's the interesting thing
7679000	7681000	The URLs were registered for
7681000	7683000	Bloodstonegame.com
7683000	7685000	Was registered Wednesday, and of course
7685000	7687000	Bloodstone is supposed to be the next Bond game
7687000	7689000	That's like the rumors that's coming out
7689000	7691000	But you know what also was registered?
7691000	7693000	Goldeneyegame.com
7693000	7695000	Hmm
7695000	7697000	Could this be, I don't know
7697000	7699000	Something where, you know, there was rumors before
7699000	7701000	There might be a Wii version of GoldenEye coming out
7701000	7703000	Or something. Who knows?
7703000	7705000	Uh, which is strange because I could've sworn
7705000	7707000	I said before, it's not fucking happening
7707000	7709000	Shut up
7709000	7711000	But you know, where there's a will, there's a way
7711000	7713000	Also, apparently a game that was discovered
7713000	7715000	DriverSanFranciscogame.com
7715000	7717000	Was registered by
7717000	7719000	Ubisoft
7719000	7721000	Uh, it's by Ubisoft
7721000	7723000	Yeah, I don't know
7723000	7725000	Well, but didn't Atari
7725000	7727000	Sell it off tonight? Yeah, that's right
7727000	7729000	So, there you go. That's too bad
7729000	7731000	Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.com
7731000	7733000	And LaserHomeBattleground.com
7733000	7735000	What the hell is that? LaserHomeBattleground?
7735000	7737000	Sounds like laser tag
7737000	7739000	Where's LaserCatsBattleground.com?
7739000	7741000	That's the game
7741000	7743000	I would've given that top of the news
7743000	7745000	Reporting. Oh, that's easy
7745000	7747000	You just put a cat stuffed animal
7747000	7749000	On top of the laser gun
7749000	7751000	Alright
7751000	7753000	Supposedly, Assassin's Creed is gonna have another
7753000	7755000	Sequel in 2011 anyway, so maybe that's the
7755000	7757000	Subtitle of the game, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood
7757000	7759000	Who knows?
7759000	7761000	Brotherhood? Yeah
7761000	7763000	Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.com
7763000	7765000	Was just registered. Uh, sounds like
7765000	7767000	Um, another
7767000	7769000	PSP game
7769000	7771000	That could be too, who knows? I'm going to the website right now
7771000	7773000	And a time's out. I guess you have to look up the registry
7773000	7775000	Info. There's no forwarding
7775000	7777000	Happening just yet
7777000	7779000	Alright guys, this is part of the show
7779000	7781000	Where we're gonna open up the Skype line and take your
7781000	7783000	Calls, 1-877-GAME-OLR
7783000	7785000	Or our username on Skype is
7785000	7787000	OrangeLoungeRadio. If you're gonna call us on Skype
7787000	7789000	That's great, the quality's really good on Skype
7789000	7791000	But we do encourage you to call
7791000	7793000	Echo123 on Skype
7793000	7795000	Or I think in the newer versions of Skype
7795000	7797000	You click a button that says test call
7797000	7799000	Or something, and you can test your configuration
7799000	7801000	First, I really urge you to
7801000	7803000	Do that, or I'm going to make fun of you
7803000	7805000	When your call stinks
7805000	7807000	OrangeLoungeRadio is the place to call on
7807000	7809000	Skype. Whatever you want to talk about
7809000	7811000	Tonight's show, go ahead
7811000	7813000	Say your piece, have a voice
7813000	7815000	While we wait for calls
7815000	7817000	Cause it takes about a minute for me to say something
7817000	7819000	And the listeners actually hear it with the encoding and everything
7819000	7821000	Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us?
7821000	7823000	Yes, apparently
7823000	7825000	There is a new game coming out
7825000	7827000	From Bayer
7827000	7829000	I guess, it's called
7829000	7831000	Knock Em Down's World's Fair
7831000	7833000	And apparently it's a device
7833000	7835000	That, or it comes with a device
7835000	7837000	That you use to check your blood glucose
7837000	7839000	Level, and you can play the game that way
7839000	7841000	That's funny, that's one of the other Tiger Claw
7841000	7843000	Stories from the Twitter, but I just
7843000	7845000	He sent so many, I had to pick and choose
7845000	7847000	One of you brought it up too
7847000	7849000	I thought I remembered hearing that this game was in development before
7849000	7851000	Like I wanted to say some time ago
7851000	7853000	I heard that there was a DS game in development
7853000	7855000	That was using like medical stuff
7855000	7857000	Yeah, I can't imagine though that this would be too
7857000	7859000	Popular, I mean it seems like a very
7859000	7861000	Narrow market that they'd be, you know
7861000	7863000	Well, yes, you're right
7863000	7865000	But, I mean for that market
7865000	7867000	I think it could actually be really cool
7867000	7869000	Cause you know there's a lot of tweens and teenagers
7869000	7871000	That get diagnosed with diabetes at a very
7871000	7873000	Young age, and this could be an interesting
7873000	7875000	Way to teach them kind of the management of that
7875000	7877000	Cause you know you have to alter your diet, take your blood
7877000	7879000	Glucose, know what it means, you know there's a lot
7879000	7881000	That goes with it, it's not just like, hey you have
7881000	7883000	Diabetes, you know there's a lot of things
7883000	7885000	That go with it, so I actually
7885000	7887000	Think, even though yeah you're right, it's a niche thing
7887000	7889000	It's kind of neat
7889000	7891000	It is
7891000	7893000	But I'm sure it will sell the particular products
7893000	7895000	You know, it's
7895000	7897000	Monitors and stuff for what, $200
7897000	7899000	A pop, and then you have to buy test strips
7899000	7901000	I mean I know your insurance usually
7901000	7903000	Covers that stuff, but you still have some choices
7903000	7905000	On what brands you get
7905000	7907000	It's still pretty crazy, I have
7907000	7909000	A number of friends who have to monitor
7909000	7911000	Yeah, especially if you're
7911000	7913000	The type 1
7913000	7915000	Yeah, there's different stages of it
7915000	7917000	Sometimes you can be diabetic, but you don't actually
7917000	7919000	Have to test anything, but you still
7919000	7921000	Well you still have to watch it, or I guess you could slip
7921000	7923000	Into one of the other types
7923000	7925000	Well, you typically adult onset, I believe
7925000	7927000	That's type 2
7927000	7929000	Yeah, my grandma had it
7929000	7931000	So, it was unfortunate
7931000	7933000	I don't know why
7933000	7935000	You know what, I upgraded the version of Skype
7935000	7937000	So I'm almost worried that the calls aren't coming through
7937000	7939000	So I'm just gonna make sure
7939000	7941000	Well Bobby's call came through
7941000	7943000	Yeah it's true, Bobby's call came through, so that should work
7943000	7945000	I'm just calling the 877 number to make sure everything's okay
7945000	7947000	Where are you people?
7947000	7949000	I know, it's kind of weird, we're not getting any calls tonight
7949000	7951000	Usually it's flooded with people
7951000	7953000	I guess they're worried about the threats of sending people
7953000	7955000	To mantis.net, I don't know
7955000	7957000	Well I've got some more last minute stories
7957000	7959000	Alright, let's hear it
7959000	7961000	MacWarrior 4, there was that whole
7961000	7963000	Kind of delay
7963000	7965000	They were gonna release the game free
7965000	7967000	To play over the web
7967000	7969000	And it was being held up by
7969000	7971000	Microsoft, now it's finally been cleared
7971000	7973000	So there will be coming
7973000	7975000	Coming soon, there will be a brand new
7975000	7977000	Port of MacWarrior 4
7977000	7979000	That you'll be able to play
7979000	7981000	For free, over the internet, through a web browser
7981000	7983000	Isn't that exciting?
7983000	7985000	Mad Catz is apparently now gonna be making
7985000	7987000	All the principal peripherals
7987000	7989000	For Rock Band
7989000	7991000	Basically that means
7991000	7993000	All the peripherals that come with
7993000	7995000	Say Rock Band 3
7995000	7997000	Or any future releases
7997000	7999000	Going forth
7999000	8001000	Will be made by Mad Catz
8001000	8003000	And not by EA or whoever the hell they had
8003000	8005000	Making their peripherals
8005000	8007000	And yeah I know Mad Catz peripherals
8007000	8009000	At one time really suck
8009000	8011000	But to be honest I kind of like their
8011000	8013000	Guitar at least
8013000	8015000	I have the bass and
8015000	8017000	I dig that, it's pretty cool
8017000	8019000	Does it wear out like
8019000	8021000	The fucking
8021000	8023000	Rock Band, just regular guitar they have
8023000	8025000	Guess what, we got a call
8025000	8027000	Awesome
8027000	8029000	Hi, you're on Orange Zon's radio, who's this?
8029000	8031000	Hi, this is Amiga777
8031000	8033000	Amiga777
8033000	8035000	I love the Amiga, what's up?
8035000	8037000	Just testing the streams
8037000	8039000	To make sure that the calls
8039000	8041000	Are going through for you
8041000	8043000	That's pretty much it
8043000	8045000	AOK works great
8045000	8047000	Thanks
8047000	8049000	Wait wait wait, you're not gonna
8049000	8051000	He just hung up
8051000	8053000	Ah yes
8053000	8055000	Just confirm me it's not your stream
8055000	8057000	We just don't want to talk to you
8057000	8059000	This is just a courtesy call
8059000	8061000	Just checking
8061000	8063000	That's right, everything's fine guys
8063000	8065000	No worries, you're good
8065000	8067000	Oh that's funny
8067000	8069000	Oh right, whatever
8069000	8071000	Here's someone that we haven't heard from
8071000	8073000	That's one of my favorite phone calls
8073000	8075000	I've ever got, just so you know
8075000	8077000	Alright, here's someone we haven't heard from
8077000	8079000	In a while, actually two years
8079000	8081000	To be exact
8081000	8083000	Surfer Girl is back with a new rumor
8083000	8085000	Regarding the slim
8085000	8087000	Xbox 360
8087000	8089000	She says it's gonna be unveiled at E3
8089000	8091000	They're gonna rebrand the Xbox 360
8091000	8093000	As well
8093000	8095000	Apparently
8095000	8097000	The review will happen
8097000	8099000	Some 360
8099000	8101000	Natal bundle will happen at one of the
8101000	8103000	Two Yes2
8103000	8105000	Press conferences at this year's E3
8105000	8107000	What's more is the 360 will be
8107000	8109000	Getting a subtle rebrand
8109000	8111000	With a new logo and black is the new
8111000	8113000	Primary color for the console
8113000	8115000	They feel that the new system needs to be black
8115000	8117000	Because a white Natal
8117000	8119000	Wouldn't sit well against the typical
8119000	8121000	Gloss black TV
8121000	8123000	The new system design is pretty neat
8123000	8125000	And Natal, let's just say
8125000	8127000	You're gonna be very surprised and very pleased
8127000	8129000	By one of the games being revealed
8129000	8131000	What is it?
8131000	8133000	And then of course, in bold
8133000	8135000	It says, might get shot
8135000	8137000	Or MGS
8137000	8139000	Perhaps a new Metal Gear Solid game
8139000	8141000	Alright, let's go to the phones
8141000	8143000	We have another test call coming in
8143000	8145000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
8145000	8147000	Hey
8147000	8149000	Hi
8149000	8151000	Hello
8151000	8153000	Hello
8153000	8155000	Hey, DT, what's on your mind?
8155000	8157000	Hi, you're here
8157000	8159000	Turn down the speakers on the computer
8159000	8161000	Because then you get all confused
8161000	8163000	So what's up? What's on your mind, buddy?
8163000	8165000	Plug in the
8165000	8167000	I know it's a monthly
8167000	8169000	Plug in the WonderCon
8169000	8171000	Article
8171000	8173000	That's right, WonderCon, you got to go to WonderCon
8173000	8175000	A couple weeks ago and you wrote a nice little article
8175000	8177000	About it that's on the website
8177000	8179000	That's cool, how did you
8179000	8181000	How did you enjoy things at WonderCon?
8181000	8183000	Did you have a good time overall?
8183000	8185000	Oh god, yeah
8185000	8187000	First stop was at a
8187000	8189000	Capcom booth, they were showing
8189000	8191000	Final Fight and Super Street Fighter 4
8191000	8193000	And Plus Planet 2, actually
8193000	8195000	You know, I actually read
8195000	8197000	The article, believe it or not
8197000	8199000	And I heard you scored a soundtrack
8199000	8201000	At the booth, what'd you get there?
8201000	8203000	Actually, that was just posted online
8203000	8205000	What I got was a couple
8205000	8207000	Yeah, no, you're right, I thought the
8207000	8209000	Rockman 9 soundtrack
8209000	8211000	Nice
8211000	8213000	I like how you call it Rockman 9
8213000	8215000	And not Mega Man 9, was it actually the Japanese
8215000	8217000	Version?
8217000	8219000	Yeah, it was
8219000	8221000	No, that's cool, very cool
8221000	8223000	It's interesting, though, that you were at
8223000	8225000	See, this kind of blows me away
8225000	8227000	Even though I know it was a few weeks ago you went to
8227000	8229000	WonderCon at this point, so for some people
8229000	8231000	This does strike me as interesting
8231000	8233000	Capcom had to know
8233000	8235000	Marvel vs. Capcom 3 was
8235000	8237000	Happening when they did WonderCon
8237000	8239000	But yet, they didn't say anything
8239000	8241000	At what you would otherwise
8241000	8243000	Think is a really freaking
8243000	8245000	Logical place to announce a game like
8245000	8247000	Marvel vs. Capcom 3
8247000	8249000	And yet, not a peep, right?
8249000	8251000	I know
8251000	8253000	They talked about being at future
8253000	8255000	Comic Cons and whatnot
8255000	8257000	With that
8257000	8259000	I guess WonderCon just wasn't good enough, sad cry
8259000	8261000	Upset
8261000	8263000	But hey, there's
8263000	8265000	BayCon coming up
8265000	8267000	I think is a big sci-fi nerdy con
8267000	8269000	I don't know if there will be a lot of video games of that
8269000	8271000	But I know I had some friends talking about that
8271000	8273000	Memorial Day weekend, and of course, Fonome
8273000	8275000	Memorial Day weekend is always a big con weekend
8275000	8277000	So there's a lot of that coming up
8277000	8279000	Any cons in your future, otherwise?
8279000	8281000	I don't know
8281000	8283000	Probably just trying to go to
8283000	8285000	WonderCon next year
8285000	8287000	I know my brother was excited about that
8287000	8289000	He's really big into comics
8289000	8291000	That's cool, you gotta go to Comic Con
8291000	8293000	I've heard that the one that happens in San Diego
8293000	8295000	Is epic, I would love to go someday
8295000	8297000	But I just don't know if I'm gonna make it
8297000	8299000	That's weird
8299000	8301000	It wouldn't surprise me at all, with all the stars
8301000	8303000	And everything to go, I'll have to plan for 2011
8303000	8305000	Or something
8305000	8307000	Well, Darktotu, Darktotu, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?
8309000	8311000	Well
8311000	8313000	Yeah, no, I know
8313000	8315000	I heard some
8315000	8317000	footage got stolen at the Super Street Fighter
8317000	8319000	4 launch event
8319000	8321000	I don't know if he talked about that
8321000	8323000	We didn't, what did you hear about this?
8323000	8325000	I vaguely remember seeing an article on this
8325000	8327000	What's up, what's going on?
8327000	8329000	I don't know, I guess someone stole a bunch of stuff
8329000	8331000	But the Super Street Fighter launch event
8331000	8333000	Like, footage of
8333000	8335000	the different players and all of that
8335000	8337000	And a MacBook
8337000	8339000	So they want to know who the hell
8339000	8341000	But the game's like, I don't get what the
8341000	8343000	advantage would be to stealing something like that
8343000	8345000	Like, the game is pretty much out now
8345000	8347000	They didn't steal anything regarding the game
8347000	8349000	They stole camera equipment
8349000	8351000	And SDI records
8351000	8353000	And a MacBook
8353000	8355000	It was that they wanted the computer equipment
8355000	8357000	It wasn't anything to do with what was on it
8357000	8359000	It was, uh, I am 8-bit
8359000	8361000	Oh, that's stinky
8361000	8363000	How did a thief get into an event like that?
8363000	8365000	That's terrible
8365000	8367000	Well, you see the people that play Street Fighter
8367000	8369000	Oh, stop it! I play Street Fighter, you ass
8371000	8373000	But yeah, there are some shady people that play
8373000	8375000	Street Fighter, just saying
8375000	8377000	But that dates back to 1992
8377000	8379000	So, well
8379000	8381000	There's shady people that play anything
8381000	8383000	That's very true
8383000	8385000	Dark Tetsuya, thieves suck and they should be laughed at
8385000	8387000	And taunted
8387000	8389000	And made fun of
8389000	8391000	And that's why we're here
8391000	8393000	Alright, well, Dark Tetsuya, thanks so much for the phone call
8393000	8395000	We're gonna let you go to see if, you know, anyone else
8395000	8397000	by chance, you know, we want to free up the phone line
8397000	8399000	of those floods of calls that are coming in tonight
8399000	8401000	Alright, you take care
8401000	8403000	And thanks for all you do for OLR, we appreciate it
8403000	8405000	Take care
8405000	8407000	Yeah, no problem
8407000	8409000	The fine Dark Tetsuya, who really tries to actually
8409000	8411000	put content on orangeontraded.com
8411000	8413000	Nice guy
8413000	8415000	Tigerclaw says they don't care about the equipment
8415000	8417000	All they care about is getting the footage
8417000	8419000	Tigerclaw says they recorded footage of the event
8419000	8421000	Yeah, they just want the footage back
8421000	8423000	That's just messed up
8423000	8425000	Thieves suck
8425000	8427000	Alright, what else you got, Loki?
8427000	8429000	Anything else?
8429000	8431000	Just some last minute stuff here
8431000	8433000	There's another little big
8433000	8435000	Or, I guess, a little big planet
8435000	8437000	PSP download content pack
8437000	8439000	that's gonna be coming out called the Turbo Pack
8439000	8441000	And it's gonna feature some
8441000	8443000	new
8443000	8445000	stock car racing inspired tracks
8445000	8447000	and vehicles
8447000	8449000	And also they're gonna have
8449000	8451000	I guess some construction based vehicles
8451000	8453000	as well that are gonna be available
8453000	8455000	such as forklifts, cranes, and cement mixers
8455000	8457000	So that's kinda neat
8457000	8459000	Unbound Saga
8459000	8461000	which was kind of a comic-based
8461000	8463000	beat-em-up game that was on the
8463000	8465000	PSP is now making its way
8465000	8467000	to Xbox Live Arcade
8467000	8469000	Kind of a little bit like Comic Zone, I guess
8469000	8471000	PSP one is kinda
8471000	8473000	alright, I guess
8473000	8475000	But that'll be coming out a little bit later on
8475000	8477000	this year
8477000	8479000	Asia is getting
8479000	8481000	a limited edition Final Fantasy
8481000	8483000	13 controller
8483000	8485000	with the silkscreen of lightning on it
8485000	8487000	I guess to go with your Final Fantasy
8487000	8489000	13 lightning
8489000	8491000	PS3. Why that wasn't
8491000	8493000	included with the PS3 is beyond
8493000	8495000	me, but whatever
8495000	8497000	I guess, you know, opportunity to sell it twice
8497000	8499000	And then
8499000	8501000	Lastly
8501000	8503000	just a little bit of elaboration on a story
8503000	8505000	we had earlier talking about delays
8505000	8507000	from Nintendo, kind of as
8507000	8509000	I thought, different things
8509000	8511000	It's taken a little bit longer to get the
8511000	8513000	development for Metroid Other M done
8513000	8515000	because they're working with a third party company
8515000	8517000	on it
8517000	8519000	That's why it's been delayed to August 31st
8519000	8521000	And then of course Sin and Punishment
8521000	8523000	Star Successor is just basically to fill the
8523000	8525000	space
8525000	8527000	because it was originally going to come out at the beginning of the month
8527000	8529000	And they did their excuses
8529000	8531000	Well we just want you to have some more time to play
8531000	8533000	Super Mario Galaxy 2
8533000	8535000	So, that is it
8535000	8537000	Alright
8537000	8539000	Well, I don't know what's up
8539000	8541000	Something's in the water
8541000	8543000	Come on people! Ron Sean, call us
8543000	8545000	No, I closed Skype
8545000	8547000	One last thing also, forgot
8547000	8549000	This might be the next Yaris
8549000	8551000	Apparently, Audi is releasing
8551000	8553000	a free rhythm based driving game
8553000	8555000	for the iPhone
8555000	8557000	Oh goody
8557000	8559000	No more to say there
8559000	8561000	Well, I don't know
8561000	8563000	I guess, you know, it's okay
8563000	8565000	Some weeks, you know, in all things considered
8565000	8567000	it was a bit of a slow news week
8567000	8569000	of sorts, you know, a lot of the stories we had
8569000	8571000	tonight weren't like huge things
8571000	8573000	I mean a lot of stories were confirmations of things that were spoiled
8573000	8575000	last week and you know
8575000	8577000	It really does, but where's the love?
8577000	8579000	Where's the love?
8579000	8581000	I could use the extra time tonight to
8581000	8583000	take care of some things before work tomorrow
8583000	8585000	I'm sure we all could so
8585000	8587000	I think we're going to wrap it up, believe it or not
8587000	8589000	A little bit of a shorter show tonight, but that's okay
8589000	8591000	Again, it just wasn't a huge
8591000	8593000	huge week for news
8593000	8595000	It was like a bunch of Capcom news
8595000	8597000	We already knew that
8597000	8599000	Of course, you know, it's going to be like this for a few weeks
8599000	8601000	because E3 is on the horizon
8601000	8603000	so outside of your E3 leaks
8603000	8605000	May is going to be a bit of a slow month
8605000	8607000	If I'd known
8607000	8609000	we would have planned a game or something for tonight
8609000	8611000	So you know what that means next week
8611000	8613000	if it's a slow news week again, we're going to have a game
8613000	8615000	or something
8615000	8617000	Or we might have an actual guest on the show
8617000	8619000	I know my friend Matt is dying to come back
8619000	8621000	He was here back when the show was still at my house
8621000	8623000	He's like, I really want to come back and hang with you guys
8623000	8625000	I'm like, okay
8625000	8627000	I'm sure Alan will be here in the next couple of weeks
8627000	8629000	He's loving coming to the show
8629000	8631000	So we'll have him at some point
8631000	8633000	BlackWolfInChat says
8633000	8635000	Okay, so let me get this straight
8635000	8637000	Rama calls my show for the first time ever
8637000	8639000	but doesn't call OLR
8639000	8641000	It's a weird night
8641000	8643000	It's okay
8643000	8645000	No, I closed Skype, I'm sorry guys
8645000	8647000	The moment's passed
8647000	8649000	The opportunity has passed
8649000	8651000	That's okay
8651000	8653000	I won't take it personally
8653000	8655000	He's just going to have a big diva stop
8655000	8657000	Send us some emails
8657000	8659000	mailbagatorangeloungeradio.com
8659000	8661000	and all that fun stuff
8661000	8663000	And see, I would love to
8663000	8665000	just do a game
8665000	8667000	pull a game out of the hat, but we don't have anything
8667000	8669000	That's okay guys, no seriously
8669000	8671000	I could stand to wrap up the show by 9 o'clock
8671000	8673000	and then go home and take care of some other stuff
8673000	8675000	So, we are out you guys
8675000	8677000	Let's go around
8677000	8679000	You know what you could do? What?
8679000	8681000	You should play the clip of Julian again
8681000	8683000	Because you know what? No phone call that we're even
8683000	8685000	going to get could possibly match
8685000	8687000	how disgustingly cute Julian is
8687000	8689000	in that clip
8689000	8691000	He's a cute kid
8691000	8693000	I'm telling you, this is going to be all the rage
8693000	8695000	at youtube.com slash users slash dark
8695000	8697000	sakura OLR
8699000	8701000	Dalek
8701000	8703000	What does a Dalek say?
8707000	8709000	Is that my night?
8709000	8711000	That's the cutest, and look at that expression
8711000	8713000	I know
8713000	8715000	One more time
8715000	8717000	One more time
8717000	8719000	What does a Dalek say?
8719000	8721000	Exterminate
8721000	8723000	I like how he even says it a little bit robotically
8723000	8725000	Exterminate
8727000	8729000	I love it
8729000	8731000	I wish I had grown up on a show like Doctor Who
8731000	8733000	That's kind of awesome
8733000	8735000	Did you? No, I didn't really, not me
8735000	8737000	Keep in mind
8737000	8739000	I was watching PBS a lot
8739000	8741000	when I was a kid
8741000	8743000	So Doctor Who came on PBS
8743000	8745000	So I started with like
8745000	8747000	fourth Doctor
8747000	8749000	Sarah Jane era
8749000	8751000	So she's always
8751000	8753000	going to be my favorite because she's who I remember
8753000	8755000	May Satsuma in chat says
8755000	8757000	Julian is smarter than DS Master
8757000	8759000	confirms
8759000	8761000	Julian is smarter than most
8761000	8763000	adults I know
8763000	8765000	I know, I'm serious
8765000	8767000	He's a smart kid
8767000	8769000	And he's a bit of a smart ass too
8769000	8771000	Just like his parents A little bit sassy?
8771000	8773000	A lot Okay, very cool
8773000	8775000	Alright
8775000	8777000	I didn't have Doctor Who to
8777000	8779000	grow up on though, you know what shows I watched growing up?
8779000	8781000	I watched Sesame Street
8781000	8783000	Of course, I mean god, who didn't watch Sesame Street?
8783000	8785000	And 321 Contact
8785000	8787000	And then later on
8787000	8789000	as I was getting older, Square One TV
8789000	8791000	Remember that show?
8791000	8793000	They need a show like that again
8793000	8795000	That's the one they used to play in a homeroom I think
8795000	8797000	They didn't play it at school
8797000	8799000	No, we had Channel One
8799000	8801000	Or something
8801000	8803000	They would pipe this
8803000	8805000	like pay cable show
8805000	8807000	into our homerooms every morning
8807000	8809000	and try to edumacate us
8809000	8811000	I just did my homework
8811000	8813000	The only show I remember watching
8813000	8815000	on like an early morning
8815000	8817000	TV thing at school was Kids Court
8817000	8819000	with Paul Provenza
8819000	8821000	I remember Kids Court
8821000	8823000	Remember that?
8823000	8825000	It was like Nick TV in the classroom or something like that
8825000	8827000	Good stuff
8827000	8829000	Alright, reminiscing is fun
8829000	8831000	but alas, the show must come to an end
8831000	8833000	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought tonight
8833000	8835000	Dark Sakura, why don't you start us off tonight
8835000	8837000	Your final thought? I found Happy Tape
8839000	8841000	My final thought is
8841000	8843000	I see some yarn over on Dark Sakura's
8843000	8845000	bookshelf and it makes me think
8845000	8847000	I wish I was a cat so I could just play with that yarn
8847000	8849000	all day Yarn, yarn, yarn
8849000	8851000	The scarf of yours I still need to finish
8851000	8853000	You need to see the scarf I got yesterday
8853000	8855000	at a thrift store for a dollar
8855000	8857000	Yes, awesome
8857000	8859000	I was like a flaming gay fourth doctor
8859000	8861000	I really was
8861000	8863000	It was very short
8863000	8865000	Because it was for a twelve year old girl
8865000	8867000	and I bought it at a thrift store to wear to Rocky
8867000	8869000	Anyhow, but that's neither here nor there
8869000	8871000	Loki, your final thought tonight
8871000	8873000	I want to play more Just Cause 2
8873000	8875000	Hopefully this time the textures actually show up
8875000	8877000	so that I can see what I'm doing
8877000	8879000	because it's kind of hard when the whole map is see-through
8879000	8881000	or most of the map is see-through
8881000	8883000	Thank you guys so much
8883000	8885000	for downloading our show
8885000	8887000	listening to it live, supporting
8887000	8889000	independent podcasting, you guys are
8889000	8891000	awesome, I know I say that week after week
8891000	8893000	but if you think about it
8893000	8895000	next week, tomorrow, next week
8895000	8897000	is episode 365
8897000	8899000	of our show, that's one
8899000	8901000	for every day of the year
8901000	8903000	and that's a whole long time
8903000	8905000	and we just wouldn't have made it this long
8905000	8907000	if it wasn't for the support of you guys
8907000	8909000	just being here every week and saying
8909000	8911000	you guys are funny
8911000	8913000	so thank you guys so much
8913000	8915000	and all we ask if you enjoyed Orange Lawns Radio
8915000	8917000	just tell a friend
8917000	8919000	or two or five about Orange Lawns Radio
8919000	8921000	and what we do here
8921000	8923000	and just help us spread the word, that's really all we ask
8923000	8925000	because many of you have shared your tweets and Facebook messages
8925000	8927000	about how you've done that and trust me
8927000	8929000	we really do appreciate it because
8929000	8931000	we don't have money to take out advertising
8931000	8933000	or whatever
8933000	8935000	we have other podcasts, so hey, if you want a guest spot
8935000	8937000	just email one of us
8937000	8939000	I know I've gone on other shows
8939000	8941000	and I don't think Dark Soccer would be opposed to it
8941000	8943000	she had another show for a little while
8943000	8945000	and I don't think Loki's going to mind
8945000	8947000	it will be back, by the way, I did ask about it
8947000	8949000	there's just
8949000	8951000	graduations coming up
8951000	8953000	and someone being very busy
8953000	8955000	I've never asked to be on our show
8955000	8957000	I'm not surprised
8957000	8959000	Loki, you were on All Games Interactive
8959000	8961000	a couple times, I think
8961000	8963000	I had to do a toss over
8963000	8965000	there you go, alright
8965000	8967000	actually, and I do also want to
8967000	8969000	say, given that
8969000	8971000	graduation thing, by the way
8971000	8973000	it's Mar and Marvel
8973000	8975000	our own Tiara
8975000	8977000	congratulations in two months
8977000	8979000	absolutely, what's the major?
8979000	8981000	graphic design
8981000	8983000	good stuff, well hopefully she'll be back on the show
8983000	8985000	hopefully she'll be taking a graduation gift trip out here
8985000	8987000	but Loki, poor Loki
8987000	8989000	who has not been on any show
8989000	8991000	somebody needs to email Loki and get him on a show
8991000	8993000	that's alright
8993000	8995000	doesn't matter
8995000	8997000	alright, let's see
8997000	8999000	Amiga777 in chat says
8999000	9001000	I nominate Tommy T to be a guest
9001000	9003000	I'm assuming he means Tommy Tallarico
9003000	9005000	we had him on a couple of years ago
9005000	9007000	it was right before the Video Games Live
9007000	9009000	CD came out, it was about two years ago
9009000	9011000	he's fun, we'd have him back on the show
9011000	9013000	maybe after E3 and all that
9013000	9015000	that was a fun show, a fun concert though
9015000	9017000	oh yeah, they're doing it again
9017000	9019000	they're doing it again at E3 this year
9019000	9021000	I wish they'd do it in San Francisco again, hopefully we'll see
9021000	9023000	alright, that's it, we're done, we're wrapping up
9023000	9025000	we're out of here, thank you guys so much
9025000	9027000	again for your support, and what do you say we do it all again next week
9027000	9029000	sound good?
9029000	9031000	and no, it is not Episode Live 365
9031000	9033000	I've got nothing going on next week, sure
9033000	9035000	we don't speak about that
9035000	9037000	are they even around still?
9037000	9039000	I believe so
9039000	9041000	but they don't look any different, they did about four years ago when we left
9041000	9047000	alright, that's it, we're done, bye, good night
9071000	9073000	see you next week
