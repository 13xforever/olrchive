1
00:00:20,882 --> 00:00:24,003
[SPEAKER_11]: And an old classic game needs a Latin translation.

2
00:00:27,785 --> 00:00:36,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio Hello my friends and welcome to episode number 362 of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:37,389 --> 00:00:40,410
[SPEAKER_09]: The video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:46,433
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

5
00:00:46,693 --> 00:00:48,654
[SPEAKER_06]: For a moment it sounded like you were using a porn voice.

6
00:00:48,954 --> 00:00:49,394
Yeah.

7
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:51,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Awful and in a bag.

8
00:01:18,772 --> 00:01:19,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

9
00:01:37,256 --> 00:01:45,339
[SPEAKER_09]: KFC, but he usually brings chicken to the show, that's no surprise, but he didn't just bring any old KFC tonight, oh no, he brought a Double Down to the show with him.

10
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,881
[SPEAKER_09]: For those that don't know what a Double Down is, Loki, please quickly define, what is the Double Down from KFC?

11
00:01:51,241 --> 00:02:00,405
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a new sandwich from KFC that just launched today, I think, and it's basically, instead of having some sort of bread holding a sandwich together,

12
00:02:00,905 --> 00:02:03,048
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

13
00:02:18,786 --> 00:02:19,327
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

14
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:37,544
[SPEAKER_10]: It's awful.

15
00:02:37,564 --> 00:02:40,606
[SPEAKER_10]: So, if you do get double down, don't get it with the cheese sauce.

16
00:02:40,706 --> 00:02:42,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, it'll probably be good without it.

17
00:02:42,888 --> 00:02:48,913
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, seriously, the strips themselves, it's all white meat, and so it's healthy for you.

18
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:50,074
[SPEAKER_10]: No, just kidding.

19
00:02:50,095 --> 00:02:50,575
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not healthy.

20
00:02:51,195 --> 00:02:52,857
[SPEAKER_10]: You can get it grilled, though.

21
00:02:53,858 --> 00:02:56,120
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to really help with all the cheese on it.

22
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:02,045
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, though, that if you got it grilled, well, it actually would be perfect for anyone doing a low-carb diet, though.

23
00:03:02,948 --> 00:03:11,899
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess, but honestly, if I want to eat healthy, quote-unquote, at KFC, I would probably get, like, a two-piece meal grilled with, like, mashed potatoes, no gravy or something.

24
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,641
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

25
00:03:14,042 --> 00:03:15,424
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just being funny.

26
00:03:15,604 --> 00:03:17,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Or I probably wouldn't go to KFC at all.

27
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:18,988
[SPEAKER_09]: I would probably just eat a fruit salad.

28
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:20,550
[SPEAKER_10]: I just was going to see if they had the Double Down.

29
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,731
[SPEAKER_10]: They did, so I got it.

30
00:03:22,512 --> 00:03:25,773
[SPEAKER_10]: I was sorely disappointed with that cheese sauce.

31
00:03:25,913 --> 00:03:30,475
[SPEAKER_10]: I figured, okay, it's just going to be something that tastes like cheese, but it's like a melted consistency.

32
00:03:30,535 --> 00:03:33,156
[SPEAKER_10]: But no, they had to spice it up with ranch or something.

33
00:03:33,876 --> 00:03:39,398
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just gross, and it's overpowering the entire sandwich or whatever it is.

34
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:40,639
[SPEAKER_06]: I could smell it from over here.

35
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:46,441
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's so unfortunate because I had high hopes for that, but oh well.

36
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,644
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually have a challenge for everybody for next month.

37
00:03:49,944 --> 00:03:50,284
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that?

38
00:03:50,965 --> 00:03:52,946
[SPEAKER_07]: No fast food for a month.

39
00:03:54,347 --> 00:03:54,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Good luck.

40
00:03:55,908 --> 00:03:57,890
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been... No, I've done it before.

41
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,971
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the first fast food I've had in two weeks.

42
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:02,153
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not dinner that I have a problem with.

43
00:04:02,193 --> 00:04:02,933
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really easy.

44
00:04:02,953 --> 00:04:04,194
[SPEAKER_09]: It's lunch at work.

45
00:04:04,334 --> 00:04:05,275
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really hard.

46
00:04:05,455 --> 00:04:07,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially when I only have had a three-minute lunch.

47
00:04:07,697 --> 00:04:10,599
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm starting a new job this coming week, which is exciting.

48
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:12,000
[SPEAKER_07]: I will tell you... Day job.

49
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:33,599
[SPEAKER_07]: My BFF, Becky, we have three days out of the week, we walk during lunch, and we bring our own lunch, and I have this huge mungus thermos thing, but the dollar store, Rob, is selling those cubes, those frozen cube things that you can put in a thermal container, so...

50
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:56,445
[SPEAKER_07]: I was, but no, it was something I was actually wanting to do is do the one month fast food free challenge and then for a, you know, it's like average how many times you want would normally go out for fast food and then, you know, put like the money that you normally would have spent on like a Happy Meal or something aside and donate it to charity at the end of the month.

51
00:04:56,485 --> 00:04:57,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Questions from chat.

52
00:04:57,245 --> 00:04:59,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Zappy says, does Subway count as fast food?

53
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:02,870
[SPEAKER_09]: What defines fast food?

54
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:03,951
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll make a list.

55
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:21,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, okay, if it's a sandwich, you know, that's, if it looks unhealthy, it probably is fast food.

56
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't you say this?

57
00:05:22,415 --> 00:05:26,458
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say the types like McDonald's and Sonic, I love Sonic.

58
00:05:26,498 --> 00:05:29,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Or do something like, maybe this, we're getting way off topic of video games.

59
00:05:29,961 --> 00:05:32,403
[SPEAKER_10]: If they serve hamburgers or tacos, they're fast food.

60
00:05:32,523 --> 00:05:35,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Or maybe if you, fast food is okay if you can keep it 10 grams of fat or less.

61
00:05:36,566 --> 00:05:36,866
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

62
00:05:37,226 --> 00:05:39,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Because like at Subway, it's really easy to do 10 grams of fat or less.

63
00:05:39,728 --> 00:05:41,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't really, okay, this is the thing.

64
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:42,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

65
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:53,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Almost any of these, I'm talking about just like the really highly processed food, you know what I mean?

66
00:05:54,518 --> 00:05:58,980
[SPEAKER_07]: I include KFC in this too because their chicken is just a gene bait.

67
00:06:01,582 --> 00:06:10,907
[SPEAKER_07]: But like, seriously, I'm giving it to start in May because I know it is, for a lot of people it's a habit to change.

68
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:15,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's try to tie it in with some type of Wii Fit or DDR or something.

69
00:06:15,235 --> 00:06:16,076
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I was thinking.

70
00:06:16,356 --> 00:06:21,622
[SPEAKER_10]: If you rub the food on a piece of paper and it turns transparent, then it's probably fast food.

71
00:06:21,642 --> 00:06:22,302
[SPEAKER_09]: The food and the paper.

72
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:22,663
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

73
00:06:23,744 --> 00:06:25,505
[SPEAKER_09]: We got to get back to a video YouTuber.

74
00:06:25,545 --> 00:06:28,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Listeners, help give us ideas and we'll formulate a contest.

75
00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:28,969
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

76
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:32,412
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but seriously, though, this is the first soda and first fast food I've had in two weeks.

77
00:06:32,632 --> 00:06:34,214
[SPEAKER_06]: I had my first soda today.

78
00:06:34,605 --> 00:06:36,206
[SPEAKER_10]: That's only because I want to try the Double Down.

79
00:06:37,886 --> 00:06:43,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Technically, I ate very few calories because I only had two bites of that in Minnesota.

80
00:06:44,829 --> 00:06:46,729
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm doing good still.

81
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,011
[SPEAKER_09]: What grade would you give the KFC Double Down?

82
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:58,134
[SPEAKER_10]: I would give it probably a D just because the cheese sauce.

83
00:06:58,294 --> 00:07:00,834
[SPEAKER_10]: If it was at the cheese sauce, I would have probably given it a B.

84
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:07,940
[SPEAKER_10]: The Double Down gets a D here on Orange Lounge Mornings on KL Games.

85
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it needs like American cheese melted on there instead of the cheese sauce and it might be good.

86
00:07:13,024 --> 00:07:16,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Once in a while we talk about video games here on the program at Orange Lounge Radio.

87
00:07:17,068 --> 00:07:21,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, if you want to pull up a chair and join us in our chat room, of course, chat at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

88
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:25,775
[SPEAKER_10]: What they need to have instead of the cheese sauce, their gravy that they have.

89
00:07:26,676 --> 00:07:27,617
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be perfect.

90
00:07:27,997 --> 00:07:28,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, enough.

91
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:29,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Enough.

92
00:07:29,318 --> 00:07:30,139
[SPEAKER_09]: No more food talk.

93
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:32,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk about games.

94
00:07:32,611 --> 00:07:34,992
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, please tell me you've played a video game this week.

95
00:07:35,352 --> 00:07:36,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Rock Band.

96
00:07:36,973 --> 00:07:39,513
[SPEAKER_07]: A fuck ton of Rock Band last night for my party.

97
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:43,534
[SPEAKER_09]: What was the best beer at your beer potluck, out of curiosity?

98
00:07:44,155 --> 00:07:44,995
[SPEAKER_09]: What was the best one?

99
00:07:45,415 --> 00:07:46,335
[SPEAKER_09]: The one that I brought, of course.

100
00:07:47,135 --> 00:07:47,516
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just kidding.

101
00:07:47,776 --> 00:07:48,456
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, Rob?

102
00:07:48,476 --> 00:07:51,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I've actually saved that chocolate beer for an occasion.

103
00:07:52,717 --> 00:07:54,718
[SPEAKER_07]: And Dan's like, they bring you, what's this?

104
00:07:54,898 --> 00:07:55,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Peach?

105
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:55,678
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

106
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:56,890
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

107
00:07:57,271 --> 00:07:57,691
[SPEAKER_08]: It's good.

108
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:02,037
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the Black Current one, but I've had tons of their different ones before.

109
00:08:02,057 --> 00:08:03,879
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't tried the Peach yet, but I love the Black Current.

110
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:12,249
[SPEAKER_07]: But the Young's is going to be... I'm going to be having one every night when I get back from school.

111
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:13,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

112
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:16,014
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be my I'm not in school beer.

113
00:08:17,472 --> 00:08:19,533
[SPEAKER_07]: There's still so much beer in my fridge, really.

114
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,434
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't really going to drink any.

115
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,035
[SPEAKER_09]: It's totally my fault, but we went from food to beer.

116
00:08:25,315 --> 00:08:26,795
[SPEAKER_09]: And just totally dodged the games.

117
00:08:27,015 --> 00:08:28,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, by the way, Rock Band.

118
00:08:28,596 --> 00:08:29,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Beer!

119
00:08:33,477 --> 00:08:34,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Totally my fault.

120
00:08:34,318 --> 00:08:35,098
[SPEAKER_07]: I enabled it.

121
00:08:35,178 --> 00:08:39,720
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a Guinness, a couple of Newcastles, about three fat tires.

122
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Clearly she was playing Tapper.

123
00:08:44,281 --> 00:08:46,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Two Killian's Reds.

124
00:08:48,587 --> 00:08:52,531
[SPEAKER_07]: I did... Heather brought the Sierra Nevada, but I really don't like Sierra Nevada, like, at all.

125
00:08:54,252 --> 00:08:59,858
[SPEAKER_07]: And... And then I was gonna go... I actually was... I picked up the four-pack.

126
00:09:00,418 --> 00:09:05,303
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, I'm gonna have... Can't drink any more beer!

127
00:09:07,065 --> 00:09:07,785
[SPEAKER_07]: I had no voice.

128
00:09:07,865 --> 00:09:08,966
[SPEAKER_07]: My throat still hurts today.

129
00:09:09,807 --> 00:09:10,548
[SPEAKER_09]: And there was rock band?

130
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:11,765
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a lot of rock band.

131
00:09:11,925 --> 00:09:13,066
[SPEAKER_07]: All day, rock band.

132
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:17,427
[SPEAKER_07]: We stopped long enough for Dan to play Outrun.

133
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:27,751
[SPEAKER_07]: And then him and one of my co-workers that showed up played... It was either him... No, I think he played with my friend Gary.

134
00:09:27,771 --> 00:09:30,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, they were playing Bad Dudes.

135
00:09:32,403 --> 00:09:33,083
[SPEAKER_09]: What kind of cake?

136
00:09:33,103 --> 00:09:33,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Chocolate and carrot.

137
00:09:56,917 --> 00:09:57,377
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

138
00:10:22,662 --> 00:10:24,023
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds like a fun project.

139
00:10:25,144 --> 00:10:27,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Should I just pitch the show for the Food Network?

140
00:10:27,185 --> 00:10:29,646
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, should we leave all games and be on a more appropriate network?

141
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:32,168
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I have tons of game stuff I could talk about.

142
00:10:32,768 --> 00:10:33,609
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just waiting.

143
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:34,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Add three cakes.

144
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:39,232
[SPEAKER_07]: One of them is gluten-free, though, so I will be taking some to work.

145
00:10:39,352 --> 00:10:40,353
[SPEAKER_09]: So Cake Mania.

146
00:10:40,753 --> 00:10:41,894
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to get cake right now.

147
00:10:43,857 --> 00:10:44,237
Loki.

148
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:53,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Here I thought this week's show would be better than the train wreck that was last week, but clearly I was underestimating the ability of this program.

149
00:10:53,463 --> 00:10:59,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Loki, before you do your gaming week, I already spoiled it and said it to the listeners last week, but congratulations for you and Nellie are in order.

150
00:10:59,687 --> 00:11:00,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, thank you.

151
00:11:00,548 --> 00:11:00,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

152
00:11:00,908 --> 00:11:07,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, she's, ironically enough today, she is as pregnant as she was when she had the twins.

153
00:11:07,192 --> 00:11:10,454
[SPEAKER_10]: So she is a little nervous, but less nervous today.

154
00:11:10,934 --> 00:11:17,237
[SPEAKER_10]: But yes, she's about 21 weeks and 4 days, I believe?

155
00:11:17,257 --> 00:11:18,297
[SPEAKER_10]: 3 days?

156
00:11:19,077 --> 00:11:19,717
[SPEAKER_10]: 21 weeks and 3 days.

157
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:24,139
[SPEAKER_10]: One boy, we know that.

158
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything's cool so far.

159
00:11:29,581 --> 00:11:30,402
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, so games.

160
00:11:30,522 --> 00:11:36,224
[SPEAKER_10]: So let me first start off with a story because this is really odd but awesome at the same time.

161
00:11:36,924 --> 00:11:41,366
[SPEAKER_10]: So Friday, you know, I think it was Friday.

162
00:11:41,526 --> 00:11:49,929
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, Friday, not this Friday but last Friday, I get this mysterious package in the mail.

163
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:51,950
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, what the hell is this?

164
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:52,790
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

165
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,481
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know who we have in Austin, Texas.

166
00:12:15,662 --> 00:12:20,025
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not far from where Travis Donovan is, but he doesn't really like this show.

167
00:12:20,145 --> 00:12:21,826
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, how did they get your address?

168
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,280
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

169
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,841
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, wait.

170
00:12:40,882 --> 00:12:42,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Doesn't that strike you as slightly creepy?

171
00:12:43,184 --> 00:12:46,126
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if I would actually be excited about the Xbox.

172
00:12:46,186 --> 00:12:49,809
[SPEAKER_09]: I would more be wondering, how did a listener get my home address?

173
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:51,070
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it was sent to my work.

174
00:12:51,951 --> 00:12:52,091
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

175
00:12:52,811 --> 00:12:54,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you said where you work on this program before?

176
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:55,674
[SPEAKER_10]: I might have at one point.

177
00:12:55,714 --> 00:12:56,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Weird.

178
00:12:56,374 --> 00:12:56,715
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

179
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:57,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe Namco sent it.

180
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:58,456
[SPEAKER_09]: They know where you work.

181
00:13:01,696 --> 00:13:04,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that makes perfect sense.

182
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:07,159
[SPEAKER_10]: We learned that a couple of years ago.

183
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,061
[SPEAKER_10]: Fun times.

184
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:12,883
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but anyways, I'm incredibly thankful for that.

185
00:13:13,123 --> 00:13:19,407
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, I've been messing with it for, well, this last week or so.

186
00:13:19,547 --> 00:13:22,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, but seriously, ask before you send us strange packages in the mail.

187
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:23,229
[SPEAKER_10]: It's always a nice thing to do.

188
00:13:23,289 --> 00:13:23,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

189
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:27,392
[SPEAKER_10]: And I mean, definitely, I would, you know, that was incredible.

190
00:13:27,472 --> 00:13:27,852
[SPEAKER_10]: And I...

191
00:13:29,253 --> 00:13:31,316
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I mean, it's a very nice gesture.

192
00:13:31,356 --> 00:13:31,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

193
00:13:32,057 --> 00:13:34,159
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a small part of me where I'm like, oh, that's awesome.

194
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:34,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, that's 90%.

195
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,443
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I was even like 95% awesome.

196
00:13:37,763 --> 00:13:40,406
[SPEAKER_09]: But 5%, like, how did they get your address?

197
00:13:41,427 --> 00:13:43,209
[SPEAKER_10]: I wasn't even thinking about that, honestly.

198
00:13:43,229 --> 00:13:44,150
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, woohoo!

199
00:13:44,271 --> 00:13:44,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah!

200
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:45,292
Yeah.

201
00:13:45,996 --> 00:13:48,319
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but it's been cool.

202
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:52,385
[SPEAKER_10]: So I've been playing a lot of games, obviously.

203
00:13:53,947 --> 00:13:54,448
[SPEAKER_09]: One more thought.

204
00:13:54,588 --> 00:13:57,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Could it have been the guy that we sicked the OL Army on?

205
00:13:57,973 --> 00:13:59,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe just... In Austin, Texas?

206
00:14:00,196 --> 00:14:01,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Would he leave the state?

207
00:14:02,238 --> 00:14:02,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe.

208
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:04,920
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

209
00:14:07,143 --> 00:14:07,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, whatever.

210
00:14:09,646 --> 00:14:11,728
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyways, so games.

211
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:14,111
[SPEAKER_10]: What did I play this week?

212
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:16,693
[SPEAKER_10]: I played actually some Japanese shooters.

213
00:14:17,634 --> 00:14:19,577
[SPEAKER_10]: Escaluda 2.

214
00:14:19,957 --> 00:14:22,880
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually played that quite a bit.

215
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Went through kind of the...

216
00:14:25,643 --> 00:14:29,304
[SPEAKER_10]: I figured I'd start off at the easy mode on there, and it's pretty fun.

217
00:14:29,644 --> 00:14:30,404
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a little different.

218
00:14:31,045 --> 00:14:36,646
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't really played a lot of the Japanese shmup games, but it's pretty fun.

219
00:14:36,766 --> 00:14:38,787
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of dodging bullets and whatnot.

220
00:14:39,867 --> 00:14:43,128
[SPEAKER_10]: So definitely worth checking out if they ever bring it over here.

221
00:14:44,348 --> 00:14:47,489
[SPEAKER_10]: Tried a little bit of Otomidius Gorgeous.

222
00:14:48,169 --> 00:14:54,431
[SPEAKER_10]: That game is a little weirder than I thought, but definitely has that whole Gradius vibe to it, of course.

223
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,132
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's pretty fun.

224
00:14:57,053 --> 00:14:59,675
[SPEAKER_10]: And played through more Final Fantasy 13.

225
00:15:00,336 --> 00:15:05,340
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm now, well, I don't know if I should say Wormat because that's kind of a spoiler, I guess.

226
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,964
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm to the point in the game where it kind of opens up like, you know, an overworld.

227
00:15:09,984 --> 00:15:10,905
[SPEAKER_10]: How many hours in are you?

228
00:15:11,525 --> 00:15:12,747
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

229
00:15:27,762 --> 00:15:36,909
[SPEAKER_10]: In Wind Waker, where you go under the ocean and you see Hyrule and you're like, why couldn't the whole game have been like this?

230
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:39,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Why couldn't they have just done this instead?

231
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:45,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's almost, to me, what this part of the game is for Final Fantasy XIII.

232
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:49,517
[SPEAKER_10]: For the people that are complaining, why isn't there an overworld in this?

233
00:15:50,337 --> 00:15:52,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Why couldn't they have done the whole game like this?

234
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:55,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's basically kind of like an overworld situation.

235
00:15:57,322 --> 00:16:12,790
[SPEAKER_10]: at the same time there's all these side quests and stuff you can do which are kind of annoying but they're relatively easy for me I guess and the narrative's kind of moving along a little bit but I still don't know entirely what's going on but I think I'm at the end or close to the end

236
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:15,011
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

237
00:16:33,018 --> 00:16:35,559
[SPEAKER_09]: So, long story short, I've been having to adjust on the fly.

238
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:40,562
[SPEAKER_09]: So, if Loki's audio is going up and down and changing around, that's me playing on the mixing board.

239
00:16:40,882 --> 00:16:42,543
[SPEAKER_09]: So, it should be all better now, though.

240
00:16:42,563 --> 00:16:43,683
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I found where it needs to be.

241
00:16:43,923 --> 00:16:44,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, listeners.

242
00:16:44,684 --> 00:16:45,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, Loki.

243
00:16:46,685 --> 00:16:47,065
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah.

244
00:16:47,145 --> 00:16:48,345
[SPEAKER_10]: So, it's all right.

245
00:16:48,446 --> 00:16:49,786
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of neat.

246
00:16:51,067 --> 00:16:51,267
[SPEAKER_10]: But...

247
00:16:52,428 --> 00:17:04,714
[SPEAKER_10]: and and unfortunately those characters aren't real it didn't seem like they're too much like lesbians at this point in the game although there was an embrace part of the game which I was like are they gonna kiss?

248
00:17:05,635 --> 00:17:19,783
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't trying to go there I was trying to keep quiet on the spoilery stuff but I do think there are lesbians in Final Fantasy XIII yeah they're close we don't know how close but they're close

249
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:21,329
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they're very close.

250
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:22,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Just saying.

251
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,371
[SPEAKER_10]: Cougar kitten thing going on there.

252
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:29,193
[SPEAKER_09]: There is definitely a cougar kitten thing going on.

253
00:17:29,553 --> 00:17:30,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, no more spoilers.

254
00:17:30,854 --> 00:17:32,354
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, anyways.

255
00:17:33,315 --> 00:17:34,335
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, it's pretty awesome.

256
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:42,138
[SPEAKER_10]: And then... And there's a loud commercial for Lysol power toilet cleaner.

257
00:17:43,139 --> 00:17:47,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways... I believe that was it as far as games, though.

258
00:17:47,761 --> 00:17:47,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

259
00:17:49,642 --> 00:17:53,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Granted, you probably guys know what JTAG consoles are for.

260
00:17:53,624 --> 00:17:54,404
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing legit.

261
00:17:54,604 --> 00:17:56,565
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby would not approve, of course.

262
00:17:58,766 --> 00:18:03,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me just say there's a lot of Rock Band download content out there.

263
00:18:04,229 --> 00:18:09,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm hoping, Loki, you're only using it to do the import games and not the shady stuff.

264
00:18:11,207 --> 00:18:12,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Import games are okay, I think.

265
00:18:12,887 --> 00:18:15,808
[SPEAKER_09]: I say import games they don't bother to release here are fair game.

266
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:16,848
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my stance on piracy.

267
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:26,070
[SPEAKER_09]: The only games I've ever really, really liked, just totally been hardcore pirating into would be the import stuff, especially back in the PS1 days.

268
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:30,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'm not going to pay to import games if the publisher doesn't believe in the game here.

269
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:39,512
[SPEAKER_10]: I did install a 640 gigabyte hard drive, though, in the shell of an old 360 case, so now I can use that because JTAG consoles allow you to do that.

270
00:18:40,572 --> 00:18:41,552
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's awesome.

271
00:18:41,893 --> 00:18:43,193
[SPEAKER_10]: I like playing games from other regions.

272
00:18:44,233 --> 00:18:44,513
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

273
00:18:46,494 --> 00:18:49,035
[SPEAKER_09]: If that's it for your gaming week, then I'll talk quickly about my gaming week.

274
00:18:49,055 --> 00:18:56,398
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually didn't play a lot of new games, just kind of a potpourri of a lot, a lot of old games this week, especially on Xbox Live Arcade.

275
00:18:56,798 --> 00:18:58,899
[SPEAKER_09]: I did play a little more Game Room, I guess I could say that.

276
00:18:58,979 --> 00:18:59,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a little more.

277
00:18:59,899 --> 00:19:04,981
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't really been working on the Yars' Revenge duel with Bobby because...

278
00:19:05,641 --> 00:19:10,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, Bradley, Arcadian42, who hasn't been on the show in quite some time, but he was here last night.

279
00:19:10,963 --> 00:19:12,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Randomly saw him yesterday, yes.

280
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:20,107
[SPEAKER_09]: He has smoked both Bobby and I. I don't think Bobby can see that, but like, now I don't just have to beat Bobby, I have to beat Bradley.

281
00:19:20,207 --> 00:19:21,828
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's even, that's 130,000 points.

282
00:19:21,908 --> 00:19:28,771
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually messed a little bit with Game Room, and I noticed I got a lot of achievements really quick by just doing stuff.

283
00:19:28,971 --> 00:19:32,133
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get about 100 points doing next to nothing.

284
00:19:32,153 --> 00:19:34,614
[SPEAKER_09]: But you do have to actually play games to get more.

285
00:19:35,194 --> 00:19:40,437
[SPEAKER_09]: But I bought Crystal Castles because I had a friend over who really wanted to see Crystal.

286
00:19:40,457 --> 00:19:42,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they remembered it from the 80s and they really wanted to play it.

287
00:19:42,778 --> 00:19:43,939
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, okay.

288
00:19:43,979 --> 00:19:46,240
[SPEAKER_09]: I liked Crystal Castles enough where I'll spend the money to get it.

289
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,601
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like renting a movie.

290
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Five bucks is about how much it costs to rent a movie.

291
00:19:50,682 --> 00:19:53,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I buy all my games for both computer and 360.

292
00:19:54,784 --> 00:20:23,082
[SPEAKER_09]: and when we got it I realized the control sucks like really sucks for that game because the controller analog stick is no substitute for a trackball not at all and then I thought oh well it'll be okay because I have it on the computer and I can use the mouse and the mouse makes it because a mouse is basically an inverted trackball so it makes it's not a perfect substitute but it's probably the best one there is so I figured okay I'll play Crystal Castles with a mouse nope can't use the mouse

293
00:20:25,888 --> 00:20:38,516
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember I used to play that on the Apple II way back in the day, and a mouse worked okay then, but I guess if they don't support it at all, then it's awful.

294
00:20:38,536 --> 00:20:54,766
[SPEAKER_09]: I could have missed something, but what I did is I unplugged my 360 controller and it defaulted to keyboard controls, and I couldn't find an option in there to switch it to the mouse to control, which makes sense because you don't have a mouse on 360, and the game is kind of made for both, and it's very obvious, but it's just...

295
00:20:55,586 --> 00:21:11,011
[SPEAKER_09]: you know it's just these little things that are just killing game room for me like there's so much potential with game room and there's so much that I really want to like about game room but there's these glaring things that just irritate me like oh why didn't you find this sooner you dummy

296
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:16,558
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, just in the servers and some of the things with that.

297
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:17,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

298
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:18,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at our chat room.

308
00:22:11,686 --> 00:22:13,487
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a much different experience when you listen live.

309
00:22:13,647 --> 00:22:19,010
[SPEAKER_09]: 6 o'clock Pacific, of course, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at allgames.com.

310
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:20,251
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really all I have for housekeeping.

311
00:22:20,271 --> 00:22:23,073
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have any shows off that I'm aware of coming up or anything else.

312
00:22:23,673 --> 00:22:26,775
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we're just going to keep right on trucking with some gaming news.

313
00:22:27,776 --> 00:22:29,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Quite a bit of gaming news coming out of Konami.

314
00:22:29,517 --> 00:22:33,180
[SPEAKER_09]: They had their Gamers Night this week, right?

315
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:33,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

316
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,260
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't know.

317
00:22:34,621 --> 00:22:35,541
[SPEAKER_09]: We didn't get invited.

318
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:37,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, but it's in LA now.

319
00:22:37,442 --> 00:22:38,683
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't have been able to go anyway if we did.

320
00:22:38,703 --> 00:22:39,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's true.

321
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:39,484
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

322
00:22:40,144 --> 00:22:41,665
[SPEAKER_10]: I always forget that they're not in San Francisco.

323
00:22:41,705 --> 00:22:42,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they're not in the Bay anymore.

324
00:22:42,706 --> 00:22:44,427
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I wouldn't have been able to go anyway.

325
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:45,328
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

326
00:22:45,648 --> 00:22:49,751
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of one of those things where, especially if they're, you know, one thing we don't have news on is DDR.

327
00:22:49,811 --> 00:22:52,412
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, I realize that's kind of how we started.

328
00:22:53,673 --> 00:22:58,438
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess, I don't know if I should say this, but I don't know if I really should say this on air.

329
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:01,080
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a very good chance we're going to have an interview with them at E3 this year.

330
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:02,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good chance.

331
00:23:03,022 --> 00:23:04,083
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to pull some strings.

332
00:23:04,463 --> 00:23:06,645
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's going to be a fun E3.

333
00:23:07,967 --> 00:23:08,267
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

334
00:23:08,827 --> 00:23:09,528
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to E3?

335
00:23:09,748 --> 00:23:09,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

336
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:10,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

337
00:23:10,949 --> 00:23:11,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

338
00:23:12,321 --> 00:23:13,141
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, anyhow, sorry.

339
00:23:13,261 --> 00:23:17,462
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to tell us some news from... I thought you... Well, you can't go.

340
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I wondered why you were so like, nope, can't go.

341
00:23:20,183 --> 00:23:22,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope, there's no way I'm going to E3 this year.

342
00:23:22,063 --> 00:23:23,944
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, well, you're not even going to ask?

343
00:23:23,984 --> 00:23:24,324
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell?

344
00:23:24,364 --> 00:23:27,564
[SPEAKER_09]: And now that we know that the wife is pregnant, now that makes sense.

345
00:23:28,545 --> 00:23:30,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Because isn't that right around the due date, too?

346
00:23:30,505 --> 00:23:31,565
[SPEAKER_09]: No, August.

347
00:23:31,765 --> 00:23:33,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no, okay.

348
00:23:33,886 --> 00:23:36,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you said a long time ago, Jamie, you couldn't go.

349
00:23:36,506 --> 00:23:37,486
[SPEAKER_09]: You said school or something.

350
00:23:38,387 --> 00:23:39,087
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to graduate.

351
00:23:39,467 --> 00:23:39,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

352
00:23:40,928 --> 00:23:42,733
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I'll go.

353
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:47,246
[SPEAKER_09]: I suppose if no one else wants to go, I'll go to E3 and do whatever...

354
00:23:49,113 --> 00:23:49,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, anyhow.

355
00:23:50,274 --> 00:23:50,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Konami!

356
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:51,315
[SPEAKER_09]: News!

357
00:23:51,395 --> 00:23:52,476
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I forgot to ask you.

358
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:52,756
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

359
00:23:52,796 --> 00:23:54,277
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you went to PAX East.

360
00:23:54,317 --> 00:23:56,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Did they have any of the PlayStation Move stuff there?

361
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:57,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you play?

362
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:00,222
[SPEAKER_09]: No, there was no Move at PAX East.

363
00:24:00,282 --> 00:24:01,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you'll have to listen to last week's show.

364
00:24:01,584 --> 00:24:01,964
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm kidding.

365
00:24:02,444 --> 00:24:04,186
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to listen to last week's show.

366
00:24:04,346 --> 00:24:05,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it was pretty bad.

367
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,348
[SPEAKER_09]: This week's isn't turning out much better.

368
00:24:08,689 --> 00:24:09,450
[SPEAKER_09]: APB was there.

369
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,132
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's the one you would have liked the most.

370
00:24:11,412 --> 00:24:13,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they had a playable ABP.

371
00:24:13,373 --> 00:24:13,994
[SPEAKER_09]: I definitely thought of you.

372
00:24:14,334 --> 00:24:15,635
[SPEAKER_09]: I do have video I shot.

373
00:24:15,655 --> 00:24:17,137
[SPEAKER_09]: I can show you at some point.

374
00:24:17,877 --> 00:24:18,037
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

375
00:24:18,077 --> 00:24:21,338
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the one that... Well, actually, you would have really enjoyed the line.

376
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:22,839
[SPEAKER_09]: The Crackdown 2 was out on the floor.

377
00:24:22,939 --> 00:24:23,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

378
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:28,941
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know what else you really liked, but it just seemed there was a lot of Loki games there.

379
00:24:29,181 --> 00:24:32,662
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I wanted to check out Crackdown 2, but I'll wait for that.

380
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:36,523
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm actually going back to Crackdown 1 to try to finish that.

381
00:24:37,043 --> 00:24:40,284
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I finished it, but I had to find, like, 10 orbs that I'm missing.

382
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:45,326
[SPEAKER_10]: And just... I'm trying to go back to some of the older stuff, but really...

383
00:24:47,408 --> 00:24:48,409
[SPEAKER_10]: Cracked Into is going to be awesome.

384
00:24:48,609 --> 00:24:50,550
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so sad that they pushed it to July.

385
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,091
[SPEAKER_10]: It's supposed to be coming out in May.

386
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:53,151
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

387
00:24:53,351 --> 00:24:53,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well.

388
00:24:54,232 --> 00:24:55,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, we had Konami news at some point, right?

389
00:24:56,093 --> 00:24:56,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

390
00:24:56,373 --> 00:24:56,653
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

391
00:24:56,813 --> 00:24:58,054
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's talk about Konami.

392
00:24:58,614 --> 00:25:07,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Konami is taking a page out of Capcom's book, reissuing one of their games and kind of giving it the whole HD treatment.

393
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:31,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Russian Attack 8 or Expatriate is a brand new Russian Attack game kind of looks very similar to Bionic Commando Rearmed and they're doing the whole 2.5D kind of update to it and it will be available on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network and of course the game looks pretty cool except honestly I don't

394
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:35,933
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't believe I liked Russian Attack very much, maybe just because it was very difficult.

395
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:38,355
[SPEAKER_09]: It can't be a souped-up version of the old arcade game.

396
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:40,197
[SPEAKER_09]: The old arcade game was too straightforward.

397
00:25:40,237 --> 00:25:42,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, it was a very old-school 80s game.

398
00:25:42,278 --> 00:25:44,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this is supposed to be pretty linear, too, I think.

399
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

400
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:54,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, the little video I saw, it's ironic that you compare it to Capcom and Bionic Commando, because that's the first thing I thought of, and the look of it... Just the color palette and stuff reminds me...

401
00:25:56,869 --> 00:25:57,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Shadow Complex

402
00:26:11,434 --> 00:26:14,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Bionic Commando Rearmed, I think really cashed in.

403
00:26:14,315 --> 00:26:17,295
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why we keep comparing it to this, but it's just what I think of when I see it.

404
00:26:17,315 --> 00:26:18,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they did it well.

405
00:26:18,156 --> 00:26:20,536
[SPEAKER_10]: They were the best example of doing this.

406
00:26:20,696 --> 00:26:23,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, but Bionic Commando had a lot of nostalgia with it.

407
00:26:24,057 --> 00:26:29,558
[SPEAKER_09]: I think more people remember Bionic Commando than remember Russian Attack.

408
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:32,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Quick poll of our chat room.

409
00:26:32,439 --> 00:26:35,320
[SPEAKER_09]: How many of you remember Russian Attack?

410
00:26:35,905 --> 00:26:41,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, not just, like, name triggers, oh yeah, I think that was a game somewhere, but like, actually, like, can think of in your mind how the game plays.

411
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:46,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, just, you know, especially versus Bionic Commando.

412
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:48,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a quick pull of chat.

413
00:26:48,502 --> 00:26:49,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you remember Russian Attack, Jamie?

414
00:26:50,649 --> 00:26:52,010
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember looking at it.

415
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,110
[SPEAKER_09]: And she's got a freaking vault of games.

416
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,511
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think we have Russian Attack.

417
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,252
[SPEAKER_09]: She has a freaking game that came with a dish.

418
00:26:57,452 --> 00:26:59,573
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's... That's true.

419
00:26:59,633 --> 00:27:00,693
[SPEAKER_07]: I do have a game that came with a dish.

420
00:27:00,713 --> 00:27:02,374
[SPEAKER_09]: And she doesn't remember Russian Attack very well.

421
00:27:02,414 --> 00:27:03,994
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that ought to tell you something right there.

422
00:27:04,514 --> 00:27:08,136
[SPEAKER_09]: So... And Dan's not here for us to... No, Zappy, not Russian.

423
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,377
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Rush in Attack.

424
00:27:10,437 --> 00:27:10,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

425
00:27:10,937 --> 00:27:11,877
[SPEAKER_07]: I do remember that.

426
00:27:12,017 --> 00:27:13,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Rush and Attack.

427
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:16,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, but with an N. No, wasn't there an arcade one?

428
00:27:16,979 --> 00:27:17,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

429
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we had it at my arcade.

430
00:27:19,378 --> 00:27:20,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, oh well, there you go.

431
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:25,621
[SPEAKER_07]: No, there was another game, though, that was, I was thinking, never mind.

432
00:27:25,641 --> 00:27:27,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we had it in my arcade.

433
00:27:27,282 --> 00:27:28,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Zappy in our chat room.

434
00:27:28,262 --> 00:27:30,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Russian Attack would be like Karnov.

435
00:27:30,443 --> 00:27:31,204
[SPEAKER_09]: That's Russian Attack.

436
00:27:31,344 --> 00:27:36,326
[SPEAKER_07]: It had that kind of oblique, all bold logo to it as well.

437
00:27:36,546 --> 00:27:36,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

438
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:37,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I remember it.

439
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:42,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see, TigerClaw says Rush and Attack was a game I fondly remember.

440
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:46,851
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember going to a local grocery store and putting a ton of quarters trying to beat the game.

441
00:27:46,891 --> 00:27:49,832
[SPEAKER_09]: It was hard, but then when I had fun playing it on the NES.

442
00:27:50,972 --> 00:27:56,114
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see, TigerClaw also jumps in that Rush and Attack on the NES had two-player co-op.

443
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:56,834
[SPEAKER_09]: M.A.

444
00:27:56,854 --> 00:27:59,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Satsuma said, I remember playing an XBLA demo of Rush and Attack.

445
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:00,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that count?

446
00:28:00,756 --> 00:28:02,296
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, that was one of those Konami games.

447
00:28:03,217 --> 00:28:06,918
[SPEAKER_09]: They dumped a bunch of them onto Xbox Live when the arcade was first out.

448
00:28:06,938 --> 00:28:07,919
[SPEAKER_09]: They were like a dime a dozen.

449
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:09,539
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, some of them were notable.

450
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:11,140
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, Frogger, the old arcade game.

451
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,121
[SPEAKER_09]: It was one of the first ones, so it was still pretty cool.

452
00:28:14,241 --> 00:28:15,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Gyruss, I really liked that one.

453
00:28:15,722 --> 00:28:16,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Time Pilot.

454
00:28:16,782 --> 00:28:18,423
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a lot of obscure scramble.

455
00:28:19,023 --> 00:28:20,944
[SPEAKER_10]: They need a 2.5D HD remake of Contra.

456
00:28:25,345 --> 00:28:28,246
[SPEAKER_09]: They had a Contronics, but it was just the arcade version.

457
00:28:28,266 --> 00:28:30,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, but they had a sequel they did for WiiWare.

458
00:28:30,847 --> 00:28:33,288
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, port that over.

459
00:28:34,608 --> 00:28:39,510
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll tell you one title, Konami, that will not work with this HD remix thing, and I think you've already done it anyways.

460
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:40,290
[SPEAKER_10]: Frogger.

461
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:42,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Please, God, no more Frogger games.

462
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:42,791
[SPEAKER_10]: Ever.

463
00:28:43,071 --> 00:28:44,211
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm pretty sure it's already been done.

464
00:28:44,751 --> 00:28:47,592
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a Frogger 2 on Xbox Live Arcade.

465
00:28:47,872 --> 00:28:52,094
[SPEAKER_09]: But the funny thing about it, it's actually like the third or fourth Frogger 2 that's come out.

466
00:28:52,874 --> 00:28:56,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, like, back in the Commodore 64 days, there was Frogger 2 3-deep.

467
00:28:56,978 --> 00:28:58,479
[SPEAKER_09]: There was Frogger 2 on the PlayStation.

468
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:01,061
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there was this Frogger Swampies thing.

469
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:01,601
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

470
00:29:01,641 --> 00:29:01,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

471
00:29:02,942 --> 00:29:04,243
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, DarkTetsuya has a good point.

472
00:29:04,263 --> 00:29:06,886
[SPEAKER_09]: It used to be called Green Beret in Japan, if I recall correctly.

473
00:29:06,906 --> 00:29:07,506
[SPEAKER_09]: I think he's right.

474
00:29:07,766 --> 00:29:10,388
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that game was called something completely different overseas.

475
00:29:10,428 --> 00:29:11,449
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was called Green Beret.

476
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:12,090
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

477
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:15,653
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember the game on Xbox Live, but, like, before that, not really.

478
00:29:16,053 --> 00:29:16,353
[SPEAKER_09]: You know?

479
00:29:16,974 --> 00:29:17,854
[SPEAKER_09]: So, again...

480
00:29:19,035 --> 00:29:24,016
[SPEAKER_09]: I just, you know, if the nostalgia is what they're trying to cash in on, I don't think there's a lot of nostalgia there.

481
00:29:24,436 --> 00:29:26,877
[SPEAKER_09]: So I sort of hope the game can stand on its own two feet.

482
00:29:26,937 --> 00:29:29,277
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the game can rise above the nostalgia.

483
00:29:29,318 --> 00:29:33,999
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's a great game, it won't matter that it ties into this obscure-ass 80s game nobody remembers, right?

484
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:34,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

485
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:40,300
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll see, I guess, when... I imagine there'll be more of this at E3.

486
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:41,560
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably.

487
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:45,321
[SPEAKER_09]: Robert M. says, Rush and Attack was on the Game Boy Advance compilation, wasn't it?

488
00:29:45,861 --> 00:29:47,002
[SPEAKER_09]: I am, like, 95% positive yes, it was.

489
00:29:48,563 --> 00:29:52,778
[SPEAKER_09]: It was on that Game Boy Advance compilation that had all the old school Konami games from the 80s.

490
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:55,878
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if they called it that.

491
00:29:55,898 --> 00:29:56,879
[SPEAKER_09]: It might have been on its other name.

492
00:29:56,919 --> 00:29:57,239
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

493
00:29:57,819 --> 00:30:00,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, lots of games were announced at the Konami event.

494
00:30:00,921 --> 00:30:02,742
[SPEAKER_09]: One of them is Saw II.

495
00:30:02,862 --> 00:30:03,202
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

496
00:30:03,282 --> 00:30:06,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Saw II is going to be coming out.

497
00:30:07,464 --> 00:30:09,224
[SPEAKER_09]: It's being developed by Zombie Studios.

498
00:30:09,284 --> 00:30:10,405
[SPEAKER_09]: They did the first game as well.

499
00:30:10,765 --> 00:30:18,168
[SPEAKER_09]: It's coming out for Halloween, just in time for the movie, because I think they have said that they will keep making those damn movies until they stop making money.

500
00:30:18,228 --> 00:30:20,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Considering those movies cost less than $10 million to make...

501
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,612
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to have a lot of Saw movies, guys.

502
00:30:23,672 --> 00:30:24,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately.

503
00:30:25,193 --> 00:30:31,418
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got to admit, though, I'm kind of surprised that a Saw sequel is happening because I didn't think the first game did very well.

504
00:30:31,438 --> 00:30:31,819
[SPEAKER_09]: I could be wrong.

505
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:33,580
[SPEAKER_10]: It didn't do that well, I don't think.

506
00:30:36,743 --> 00:30:38,725
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, having seen all the Saw movies...

507
00:30:41,378 --> 00:30:44,639
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so... The last one was alright, actually.

508
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:45,539
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of liked it.

509
00:30:46,639 --> 00:30:50,580
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's getting to the point like, okay... The game or the movie?

510
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,440
[SPEAKER_09]: The movie.

511
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,800
[SPEAKER_09]: But the games have nothing to do with the movies, right?

512
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,261
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't follow the plots of the movies.

513
00:30:56,301 --> 00:30:57,541
[SPEAKER_09]: They try to do their own thing, right?

514
00:30:58,401 --> 00:30:58,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Sort of.

515
00:30:59,161 --> 00:31:06,302
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm just saying, going the way of the movie, they basically killed off Jigsaw in the second movie.

516
00:31:07,122 --> 00:31:07,663
[SPEAKER_10]: Third movie.

517
00:31:09,203 --> 00:31:09,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe the second movie.

518
00:31:10,123 --> 00:31:12,509
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't remember which one they... I think it was the second one.

519
00:31:13,031 --> 00:31:16,499
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, so it kind of makes it difficult to...

520
00:31:19,508 --> 00:31:23,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep having this guy do it because now you have someone else taking over for him.

521
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:27,913
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just getting ridiculous now.

522
00:31:28,393 --> 00:31:28,913
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

523
00:31:29,313 --> 00:31:41,620
[SPEAKER_09]: According to VGCharts.com, again, take this with a grain of salt because I don't know how accurate these numbers are, but according to VGCharts.com, Saw pushed $0.21 million on the Xbox 360.

524
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:41,860
[SPEAKER_09]: That's $200,000.

525
00:31:42,721 --> 00:31:46,843
[SPEAKER_09]: And then $0.23 million on PlayStation 3, so it's actually still better on PlayStation 3.

526
00:31:47,883 --> 00:32:04,311
[SPEAKER_10]: and so that would be a combined like half million so that's not bad but they only sold that I think right at launch I don't think that they really it it was a title that kind of did made its money the first two months and then just nothing

527
00:32:04,711 --> 00:32:12,874
[SPEAKER_09]: And I should say that is worldwide because actually the game did much better overseas than it did in the Americas, which is kind of interesting.

528
00:32:14,234 --> 00:32:16,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and that explains why the PS3 sold more.

529
00:32:16,515 --> 00:32:18,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, the Xbox 360 sold more in America.

530
00:32:18,936 --> 00:32:21,797
[SPEAKER_09]: It sold about $120,000 in America and only $100,000 on PS3.

531
00:32:21,837 --> 00:32:22,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't get me wrong.

532
00:32:22,497 --> 00:32:23,577
[SPEAKER_09]: It was an alright game.

533
00:32:23,937 --> 00:32:25,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, take those sales figures with a grain of salt.

534
00:32:26,538 --> 00:32:28,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and I think the game was alright.

535
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,341
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just it was kind of repetitive, I guess.

536
00:32:30,801 --> 00:32:35,845
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, the new game, though, apparently is going to have some better puzzles in it.

537
00:32:35,885 --> 00:32:43,351
[SPEAKER_10]: They were talking about one that was being shown off as a demo, and apparently no one figured it out unless they were told how to do it.

538
00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:47,274
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I don't know if that's good or not, but it's interesting.

539
00:32:48,194 --> 00:32:54,660
[SPEAKER_09]: They're saying, of course, more yucky, gross death machines, which is the whole thing that kind of turns me off of the Saw series.

540
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:56,222
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will admit, it's weird.

541
00:32:56,382 --> 00:33:04,329
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no problem with Konami's other franchise, Silent Hill, but I have no problem with the gore in that game.

542
00:33:04,409 --> 00:33:05,711
[SPEAKER_09]: But Saw bugs me.

543
00:33:06,031 --> 00:33:06,712
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't explain it.

544
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:11,036
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe it's because Saw is a bit too real, whereas Silent Hill...

545
00:33:12,852 --> 00:33:13,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, Pyramid Head's not real.

546
00:33:14,153 --> 00:33:14,914
[SPEAKER_06]: It's supernatural.

547
00:33:15,575 --> 00:33:18,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's a little more supernatural and I can't explain what the difference is.

548
00:33:19,017 --> 00:33:21,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Saw just... I don't know.

549
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,041
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've talked about this on the show before.

550
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:26,864
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just torture porn to me and it doesn't excite me.

551
00:33:27,864 --> 00:33:29,806
[SPEAKER_09]: I get that there's people into it, but I'm just not one of them.

552
00:33:31,212 --> 00:33:31,952
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura

553
00:33:58,826 --> 00:33:59,086
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

554
00:33:59,186 --> 00:34:00,927
[SPEAKER_09]: You have some more news for us out of Konami?

555
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:01,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I do.

556
00:34:02,608 --> 00:34:05,290
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm still kind of about it.

557
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:12,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there is another Silent Hill game in the works for PS3 and Xbox 360.

558
00:34:15,355 --> 00:34:18,357
[SPEAKER_07]: But they didn't really give out any other information about that.

559
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Just said that it's another one.

560
00:34:21,999 --> 00:34:23,139
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm surprised by this news.

561
00:34:23,439 --> 00:34:28,142
[SPEAKER_09]: I assume that Silent Hill was done because I assume that Homecoming did not perform well enough.

562
00:34:28,487 --> 00:34:35,369
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't, but I mean, Shattered Memories did okay, but I actually returned my copy.

563
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:42,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't the rumor that what they were showing, like a Shattered Memories type of game, not necessarily like Homecoming?

564
00:34:43,132 --> 00:34:44,212
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought I heard something.

565
00:34:44,272 --> 00:34:47,213
[SPEAKER_09]: The rumor is it's supposed to be like a sequel to Shattered Memories.

566
00:34:47,233 --> 00:34:49,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Like what Shattered Memories was to Silent Hill 1?

567
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:51,354
[SPEAKER_09]: This is supposed to be to Silent Hill 2 or something?

568
00:34:51,394 --> 00:34:52,615
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want that.

569
00:34:52,975 --> 00:34:53,975
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to play that.

570
00:34:54,035 --> 00:34:56,896
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't really enjoy that much of Shattered Memories.

571
00:34:58,317 --> 00:34:58,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Weird.

572
00:34:58,919 --> 00:35:03,210
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, like, old, plain old good Silent Hill.

573
00:35:03,391 --> 00:35:04,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Last decent one was four.

574
00:35:04,835 --> 00:35:06,720
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's it.

575
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:10,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Silent Hill Shattered Memories on the Wii, 0.18 million.

576
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:14,752
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's less than, and again, these numbers are coming from VGCharts.com.

577
00:35:15,773 --> 00:35:17,974
[SPEAKER_09]: That's much less than what Saw moved.

578
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:18,795
[SPEAKER_09]: How did Homecoming do?

579
00:35:18,815 --> 00:35:23,417
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem is, though... Homecoming moved 0.36 million.

580
00:35:23,457 --> 00:35:26,119
[SPEAKER_09]: That's on the 360, and how much on PS3?

581
00:35:26,139 --> 00:35:26,119
0.23.

582
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:26,939
[SPEAKER_09]: So it did better than Saw.

583
00:35:29,941 --> 00:35:42,332
[SPEAKER_10]: and that's the problem though with Shattered Memories though it being the mature Wii game that system whatever the reason you can put out really awesome mature games on it but no one's buying them

584
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:52,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the other thing that strikes me odd about the fact that they're continuing the Silent Hill franchise, I mean, even if the Silent Hill Wii game was critically well received, is the departure of Akira Yamaoka.

585
00:35:53,107 --> 00:35:59,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, like, to me, he was such a key component of that franchise, like, I really don't see how they can continue it without him.

586
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:08,595
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if it's true that they're just, you know, redoing the second game, I suppose I can see that, because, I mean, how much did he really contribute to Shattered Memories?

587
00:36:08,655 --> 00:36:09,276
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think he...

588
00:36:10,356 --> 00:36:11,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Did a lot for that game.

589
00:36:11,557 --> 00:36:12,558
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't know.

590
00:36:12,578 --> 00:36:14,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Did he even do the soundtrack?

591
00:36:14,779 --> 00:36:17,481
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, he I think worked on the soundtrack for that.

592
00:36:17,501 --> 00:36:25,086
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they finally learned that they really can't do anything else with the series.

593
00:36:25,126 --> 00:36:29,248
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't have the right kind of, I think, thought process to take it where it needs to go.

594
00:36:30,709 --> 00:36:31,430
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just my thought.

595
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:35,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting comment from the chat room, because this could spar another discussion here.

596
00:36:35,674 --> 00:36:45,664
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100, Matt, in our chat room, chat.orange.radio.com says, I remember the great horror movies of the 80s when it was about the scare, no matter how cheesy the effects were, whereas now it's shot gore.

597
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:50,889
[SPEAKER_09]: He goes on to say, the thing, 80s version, is better than any Saw or Hostel movie.

598
00:36:51,689 --> 00:36:55,833
[SPEAKER_09]: And then somebody brought up, DJ Dark Knight says, Nightmare on Elm Street, nothing more, and Friday the 13th.

599
00:36:56,734 --> 00:37:01,098
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's interesting because they've remade a lot of those great 80s horror movies.

600
00:37:01,158 --> 00:37:03,421
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, Nightmare on Elm Street's coming out in a couple weeks, right?

601
00:37:04,402 --> 00:37:07,585
[SPEAKER_09]: And it seems odd to me that those are not turning into games.

602
00:37:08,225 --> 00:37:16,293
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, sure there was a Friday the 13th game years and years ago on the NES, which, by the way, I enjoyed way more than most people did, just on a tangent.

603
00:37:16,393 --> 00:37:16,753
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually...

604
00:37:17,834 --> 00:37:20,015
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate to say it because I know I'm going to get made fun of, but I don't care.

605
00:37:20,135 --> 00:37:22,456
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually enjoyed the Friday the 13th game when I was younger.

606
00:37:22,796 --> 00:37:24,556
[SPEAKER_09]: It made sense to me and I had a lot of fun playing it.

607
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:25,397
[SPEAKER_09]: It was hard as hell.

608
00:37:25,737 --> 00:37:27,417
[SPEAKER_09]: I never beat it, but I thought it was a cool game.

609
00:37:28,098 --> 00:37:32,179
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the angry video game nerd, his review of it.

610
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:32,779
[SPEAKER_07]: It was funny.

611
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,421
[SPEAKER_09]: And there was a Nightmare on Elm Street game too, if I remember right.

612
00:37:37,441 --> 00:37:38,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Which was crap.

613
00:37:38,401 --> 00:37:46,284
[SPEAKER_09]: It was crap, but if my memory is right, it was one of the very few Nintendo games that used that four player expansion they had.

614
00:37:46,744 --> 00:37:49,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember how they had the four player thing on the NES?

615
00:37:49,705 --> 00:37:54,666
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that you could change your main character and that it was still really lame.

616
00:37:55,827 --> 00:37:57,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Every character sucked, pretty much.

617
00:37:58,427 --> 00:38:06,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, with the Saw and the horror franchises, doesn't it seem odd to anyone that there is not a video game coming out for Nightmare on Elm Street?

618
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:09,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Or even that there wasn't one for Friday the 13th?

619
00:38:09,831 --> 00:38:14,792
[SPEAKER_09]: There hasn't been one for Halloween or any of the horror movies they've made in quite some time.

620
00:38:15,715 --> 00:38:16,636
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm not surprised.

621
00:38:16,917 --> 00:38:17,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Why is that?

622
00:38:17,557 --> 00:38:28,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Because first you have to pay the licenses for that, and they have an idea of how well these games perform.

623
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:52,678
[SPEAKER_10]: and something like that it'd be kind of hard to expand on the storyline and stuff like for example Nightmare on Elm Street well what the hell would the game be about I mean you're basically going after Freddy I guess or you know trying to escape him but it's just hard to expand on the how you know whether enemies and stuff are you gonna have in it it just doesn't translate well into a game

624
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:57,609
[SPEAKER_09]: It's strange, though, because so many movies that come out these days get games with it.

625
00:38:57,629 --> 00:38:58,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, Avatar had a game.

626
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Alice in Wonderland had a game.

627
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:02,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Avatar learned itself very well to a game.

628
00:39:02,254 --> 00:39:03,675
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's easy, though, to do.

629
00:39:04,336 --> 00:39:08,761
[SPEAKER_10]: There's plenty of characters in that that you can build a game off of.

630
00:39:09,321 --> 00:39:10,903
[SPEAKER_10]: And same with Alice in Wonderland.

631
00:39:10,923 --> 00:39:14,066
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's plenty of creatures and enemies and stuff you can create for the game.

632
00:39:14,987 --> 00:39:35,669
[SPEAKER_09]: I read a very interesting article this last week that said that it was on Yahoo and the little teaser was this could have been a video game and this movie franchise is losing tons of potential dollars because there is no video game and you click on it to find out what franchise they're talking about any guess?

633
00:39:36,509 --> 00:39:37,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Twilight, because I read this.

634
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:38,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, did you?

635
00:39:38,411 --> 00:39:39,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Twilight series.

636
00:39:39,552 --> 00:39:42,815
[SPEAKER_10]: What's funny is they forgot there is a game based on Twilight.

637
00:39:42,895 --> 00:39:43,695
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's the scenic game.

638
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:44,296
[SPEAKER_10]: That doesn't count.

639
00:39:44,316 --> 00:39:48,799
[SPEAKER_10]: That's still a game, and it's based on Twilight, so they're stupid because they didn't do the research.

640
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,461
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't count that.

641
00:39:50,781 --> 00:39:52,202
[SPEAKER_07]: I blame, no.

642
00:39:52,663 --> 00:39:56,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, I don't want to see it either, but they make a point.

643
00:39:57,086 --> 00:39:59,648
[SPEAKER_09]: It's strange that there is no Twilight video game.

644
00:39:59,668 --> 00:40:01,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, and again, I don't want to see it either.

645
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:03,010
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't make a good game.

646
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:03,671
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why.

647
00:40:04,391 --> 00:40:08,134
[SPEAKER_09]: But if they make a game for Alice in Wonderland and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory... But there's more characters.

648
00:40:08,214 --> 00:40:11,757
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, she's not like... Push A to Sparkle!

649
00:40:12,457 --> 00:40:12,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

650
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:19,062
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not like she's running around slaying vampires or slaying werewolves or whatever.

651
00:40:19,562 --> 00:40:24,766
[SPEAKER_10]: She's just some whiny emo chick, and you can't make a game based on that.

652
00:40:24,826 --> 00:40:26,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Push B to Lock the Door and Cry.

653
00:40:26,627 --> 00:40:29,351
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, seriously, you can't.

654
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:31,494
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't really do that.

655
00:40:31,974 --> 00:40:33,957
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no enemies for the fight.

656
00:40:33,997 --> 00:40:34,678
[SPEAKER_10]: She doesn't do that.

657
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:35,499
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't translate well.

658
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:39,184
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be like the equivalent of making a game based off of...

659
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:50,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything like, you know, like the money pit or, you know, just... I'm getting yelled at by chatters because they're saying, Ranma's saying, no Twilight game for PS3 360.

660
00:40:50,765 --> 00:40:51,545
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a smart move.

661
00:40:51,605 --> 00:40:53,166
[SPEAKER_09]: TigerClaw says, don't give them any ideas.

662
00:40:53,206 --> 00:40:54,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you really want a Twilight MMO?

663
00:40:54,407 --> 00:40:57,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I have zero interest in the game.

664
00:40:57,629 --> 00:40:59,991
[SPEAKER_09]: But the capitalist money-making...

665
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:11,194
[SPEAKER_09]: America, fuck yeah, side of me that's all about making money does say, you know, a Twilight game on the Wii that's not seen, I'm talking about an actual Twilight game, is a lost opportunity.

666
00:41:11,254 --> 00:41:11,834
[SPEAKER_09]: It really is.

667
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:16,075
[SPEAKER_09]: I have zero fucking interest in it, but I know there's a lot of girls that would play it.

668
00:41:16,135 --> 00:41:17,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's how you do it, okay?

669
00:41:17,335 --> 00:41:27,018
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is how you can translate most of those games that don't necessarily, or most of those movies that don't necessarily work as games into games and have them still be alright.

670
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:30,820
[SPEAKER_10]: You do them the way they did Heavy Rain.

671
00:41:31,601 --> 00:41:41,909
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the only way you can do it, is that you have some sort of context-based game that has a narrative that looks just like the movie.

672
00:41:42,109 --> 00:41:49,154
[SPEAKER_10]: That's really the only way you can do it, because as far as being an action game or anything like that, you can't do that with these games.

673
00:41:49,314 --> 00:41:50,275
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes no sense.

674
00:41:51,356 --> 00:41:55,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Frisbee in our chatroom says, Hey, I'd like a Twilight game if you got to play as Blade.

675
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:04,063
[SPEAKER_07]: They really could do a dating sim.

676
00:42:04,803 --> 00:42:08,985
[SPEAKER_07]: And that would sell amongst the... God, that just makes me feel dirty.

677
00:42:09,005 --> 00:42:10,466
[SPEAKER_09]: What was that shirt I saw at Hot Topic?

678
00:42:10,586 --> 00:42:12,226
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Buffy staked Edward the end.

679
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:13,787
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.

680
00:42:14,628 --> 00:42:15,548
[SPEAKER_07]: I would wear that shirt.

681
00:42:18,325 --> 00:42:19,146
[SPEAKER_09]: It was pretty awesome.

682
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,186
[SPEAKER_09]: I knew you would wear that shirt.

683
00:42:20,286 --> 00:42:20,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, sorry.

684
00:42:21,046 --> 00:42:22,207
[SPEAKER_07]: I would rock that with pride.

685
00:42:22,347 --> 00:42:27,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, I want to put out a formal apology to our listeners and everybody for bringing up Twilight on Orange Lawn Radio.

686
00:42:27,449 --> 00:42:29,310
[SPEAKER_09]: It was inappropriate of me, and I apologize.

687
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:31,971
[SPEAKER_09]: So, please, let's move on with a different video game.

688
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:34,152
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll never happen again.

689
00:42:36,813 --> 00:42:39,254
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that I'm having an allergic reaction to that, Rob.

690
00:42:39,514 --> 00:42:40,535
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you're just sparkling.

691
00:42:41,455 --> 00:42:41,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah!

692
00:42:45,852 --> 00:42:46,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, help.

693
00:42:46,692 --> 00:42:47,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, help.

694
00:43:08,403 --> 00:43:20,782
[SPEAKER_10]: and nobody told Xbox Live because apparently on the Xbox Live Marketplace there is a wonderful banner announcing the Gears of War 3 game which will be coming April 2011.

695
00:43:24,008 --> 00:43:25,429
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a year off.

696
00:43:26,449 --> 00:43:27,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

697
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:32,532
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to point out, I speculated earlier this year that Gears of War 3 would be an E3 announcement.

698
00:43:32,592 --> 00:43:36,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so maybe I screwed that up, but that it was going to support Project Natal.

699
00:43:36,174 --> 00:43:38,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that seem to be the case?

700
00:43:38,775 --> 00:43:39,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Doesn't say.

701
00:43:40,436 --> 00:43:49,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't know, but there's been some sort of rumors saying that it will feature, I guess, underwater combat this time and mech suits.

702
00:43:50,942 --> 00:43:53,705
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, not that I think it needs to support Natal.

703
00:43:53,725 --> 00:43:59,332
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just kind of my gut feeling was they've been really, really quiet about such a big franchise for them.

704
00:43:59,752 --> 00:44:04,378
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I kind of thought that it was going to be like, oh, Gears of War 383 and it's Natal.

705
00:44:04,438 --> 00:44:07,521
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why we've kept it so under the wraps.

706
00:44:07,802 --> 00:44:08,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it still is.

707
00:44:08,623 --> 00:44:09,724
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess, you know...

708
00:44:10,985 --> 00:44:15,027
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll hear more about it, maybe if you want to watch Jimmy Fallon on Monday, I guess.

709
00:44:15,307 --> 00:44:17,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Or just wait for the YouTube to hit 15 minutes later.

710
00:44:18,029 --> 00:44:18,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

711
00:44:18,809 --> 00:44:23,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, you know, I'd rather not subject myself to an hour of that.

712
00:44:23,852 --> 00:44:25,213
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd just watch the highlights.

713
00:44:25,733 --> 00:44:28,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I have to admit, I'm not huge on Gears of War either.

714
00:44:28,454 --> 00:44:29,515
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just not good at it.

715
00:44:30,175 --> 00:44:34,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Gears of War, A, I suck at first-person shooters to begin with.

716
00:44:34,259 --> 00:44:40,844
[SPEAKER_09]: B, the thing about Gears of War is it's very about cover and stealth and being able to move around and be very tactical.

717
00:44:41,265 --> 00:44:51,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas if I'm going to play an FPS, I've got to play something like Quake 3, which is just kamikaze, run out there, shoot everybody with rocket launchers, kill, kill, die, die type of stuff.

718
00:44:51,514 --> 00:44:54,957
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not good at Gears of War because I can't cover.

719
00:44:55,057 --> 00:44:57,619
[SPEAKER_09]: I just run out and shoot everything and I always die.

720
00:45:00,726 --> 00:45:07,290
[SPEAKER_10]: And stuff like that is why Gears of War makes a better game franchise than Twilight.

721
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,651
[SPEAKER_10]: Because there's no rocket launchers.

722
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:14,234
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, there's people dying, but they just whine about it.

723
00:45:16,155 --> 00:45:19,157
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100 Matt says, don't support NBC, go Team Coco.

724
00:45:19,877 --> 00:45:23,720
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's saying that you shouldn't watch the show anyway.

725
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:28,683
[SPEAKER_09]: You should just wait for whatever will show up on Xbox Live inevitably anyway.

726
00:45:29,664 --> 00:45:32,386
[SPEAKER_09]: In support of Coco, who I'm seeing live next week.

727
00:45:32,886 --> 00:45:33,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Very excited.

728
00:45:34,987 --> 00:45:35,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Very excited.

729
00:45:35,488 --> 00:45:36,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yay for you, Rob.

730
00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:39,050
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right, I should buy tickets for that.

731
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:41,231
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they're all sold out everywhere.

732
00:45:41,251 --> 00:45:42,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I meant for Sacramento.

733
00:45:43,553 --> 00:45:44,374
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

734
00:46:05,436 --> 00:46:06,017
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

735
00:46:35,235 --> 00:46:41,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Not cool because A, you don't know what caused the error, which is going to be bad for EA and Mythic.

736
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:47,443
[SPEAKER_09]: They're trying to refund the fees within 24 to 36 hours, but here's the problem.

737
00:46:47,864 --> 00:46:55,029
[SPEAKER_09]: People are going to start bouncing checks, they're going to overdraft, and they're going to threaten EA with this.

738
00:46:55,469 --> 00:46:59,151
[SPEAKER_09]: EA is going to have to pay for all these overdraft fees that they cause.

739
00:46:59,351 --> 00:46:59,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Without a doubt.

740
00:47:00,452 --> 00:47:02,413
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that's just not pretty for them.

741
00:47:02,453 --> 00:47:03,154
[SPEAKER_09]: That sets them back.

742
00:47:03,194 --> 00:47:04,195
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a big boo-boo.

743
00:47:05,335 --> 00:47:09,038
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's the one reason to be careful with these automatic withdrawals.

744
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:12,901
[SPEAKER_09]: But it stinks because so many games kind of require them in this day and age.

745
00:47:13,582 --> 00:47:19,827
[SPEAKER_09]: But it makes you think about maybe using those prepaid cards instead because you don't want something like this happening to you, I'm sure.

746
00:47:21,493 --> 00:47:43,825
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean I don't think anybody did this intentionally or purposely I mean surely it was an error it's just a really crappy error that is just really no one wins in this scenario no one wins no and it's not like Warhammer Online was a game that was it kind of didn't need something like this on its reputation right now it's it's very unfortunate um

747
00:47:45,442 --> 00:47:47,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you imagine if something like that happened with WoW?

748
00:47:47,683 --> 00:47:48,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh.

749
00:47:48,964 --> 00:47:49,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh.

750
00:47:49,444 --> 00:47:54,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Banks would go under from all the people that would complain and rise up.

751
00:47:55,128 --> 00:47:55,688
[SPEAKER_09]: My gosh.

752
00:47:56,889 --> 00:48:02,672
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it affected everyone that played, but I think just those that probably had their statements renewed on a certain day, but still.

753
00:48:02,912 --> 00:48:03,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Stinks.

754
00:48:04,053 --> 00:48:04,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Too bad for them.

755
00:48:06,874 --> 00:48:07,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

756
00:48:08,035 --> 00:48:11,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Ranma in our chat says, That happened to me with a hotel for Anime Boston.

757
00:48:11,176 --> 00:48:12,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Took them two weeks to refund my money.

758
00:48:14,937 --> 00:48:17,018
[SPEAKER_09]: So irritating that companies can do that.

759
00:48:17,078 --> 00:48:17,678
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know what?

760
00:48:17,758 --> 00:48:25,982
[SPEAKER_09]: If it results in overdraft fees and it's this company's fault, you should take them to task for it.

761
00:48:26,022 --> 00:48:26,762
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll refund the money.

762
00:48:26,802 --> 00:48:27,302
[SPEAKER_09]: They have to.

763
00:48:28,643 --> 00:48:28,863
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

764
00:48:28,903 --> 00:48:29,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

765
00:48:29,798 --> 00:48:30,778
[SPEAKER_07]: That's messed up.

766
00:48:31,078 --> 00:48:31,319
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

767
00:48:32,339 --> 00:48:35,440
[SPEAKER_07]: I looked at that and I was just like, yet another reason to hate Warhammer!

768
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:37,201
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what, though?

769
00:48:37,221 --> 00:48:38,361
[SPEAKER_09]: That could have happened at any game, though.

770
00:48:39,421 --> 00:48:46,024
[SPEAKER_09]: I would bet money that EA Mythic contracts another company to handle all this and that company botched up.

771
00:48:46,704 --> 00:48:46,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Doctor Who

772
00:49:08,996 --> 00:49:09,556
[SPEAKER_07]: on PC.

773
00:49:09,996 --> 00:49:11,157
[SPEAKER_07]: We get a Doctor Who game.

774
00:49:12,097 --> 00:49:12,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Who?

775
00:49:13,818 --> 00:49:14,178
[SPEAKER_10]: Doctor.

776
00:49:14,698 --> 00:49:14,858
[SPEAKER_10]: Who?

777
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:15,679
[SPEAKER_10]: Doctor.

778
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:16,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Who?

779
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:19,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Do not make me go hunt down my sonic screwdriver, please.

780
00:49:20,461 --> 00:49:20,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

781
00:49:22,757 --> 00:49:42,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Starting on June 2010, there are going to be four interactive episodes that are going to be free on the BBC Doctor Who website with the current cast and the new producer, writer, guy, and a lot of...

782
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:51,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Just story elements, I guess, going on with what's currently, I guess, going to happen in this season, and it's being developed by Sumo Digital.

783
00:49:55,228 --> 00:50:07,434
[SPEAKER_07]: It actually was said by the head of drama for BBC Wales, the executive producer for Doctor Who, that there aren't going to be 13 episodes, there will be 17, four of which are interactive.

784
00:50:08,275 --> 00:50:08,395
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

785
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:10,156
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

786
00:50:31,503 --> 00:50:32,965
[SPEAKER_09]: But that doesn't mean they won't do games.

787
00:50:33,526 --> 00:50:34,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it does.

788
00:50:35,027 --> 00:50:35,208
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

789
00:50:35,508 --> 00:50:36,089
[SPEAKER_07]: They ended it.

790
00:50:36,129 --> 00:50:37,210
[SPEAKER_07]: They completely ended it.

791
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:41,655
[SPEAKER_09]: But can't they go back and do games from, you know, the canon earlier in the show or something?

792
00:50:41,675 --> 00:50:42,916
[SPEAKER_07]: I seriously doubt that's going to happen.

793
00:50:42,936 --> 00:50:45,800
[SPEAKER_09]: They do that all the time with franchises that are over.

794
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:48,102
[SPEAKER_09]: They reinvigorate it for a game.

795
00:50:48,563 --> 00:50:49,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, okay.

796
00:50:49,304 --> 00:50:49,845
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll give you that.

797
00:50:50,425 --> 00:50:52,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's my northern exposure?

798
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:53,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut up.

799
00:50:54,029 --> 00:51:02,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't there talk, actually, I'll say this not to deviate to sci-fi nerddom for a minute here, but wasn't there a talk that Fox wanted to do an American version of Torchwood?

800
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:03,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Dear God, no.

801
00:51:03,941 --> 00:51:04,442
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope not.

802
00:51:05,015 --> 00:51:08,537
[SPEAKER_09]: and something about the guy, why can't I remember his name?

803
00:51:08,877 --> 00:51:10,218
[SPEAKER_09]: The guy that plays Captain Jack.

804
00:51:11,218 --> 00:51:13,979
[SPEAKER_09]: They actually were thinking of having him do it.

805
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:14,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Johnny Depp?

806
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:15,440
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

807
00:51:16,381 --> 00:51:17,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that Captain Jack.

808
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:18,141
[SPEAKER_09]: The other one.

809
00:51:19,102 --> 00:51:20,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Why can't I remember his name?

810
00:51:20,082 --> 00:51:20,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my God.

811
00:51:21,863 --> 00:51:22,404
[SPEAKER_07]: John Barrowman.

812
00:51:22,484 --> 00:51:22,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

813
00:51:23,104 --> 00:51:23,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Barrowman.

814
00:51:23,704 --> 00:51:28,967
[SPEAKER_10]: The guy that played Captain Jack and sang all those songs and dressed up like a captain with hoochies hanging off of him?

815
00:51:29,507 --> 00:51:30,367
[SPEAKER_10]: That Captain Jack?

816
00:51:31,068 --> 00:51:31,188
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

817
00:51:31,368 --> 00:51:31,568
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

818
00:51:31,748 --> 00:51:32,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that Captain Jack.

819
00:51:32,729 --> 00:51:33,329
[SPEAKER_07]: John Barrowman.

820
00:51:33,349 --> 00:51:33,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

821
00:51:36,054 --> 00:51:37,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Captain Jack is such a common name.

822
00:51:59,986 --> 00:52:23,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Grand Theft Auto episodes from Liberty City making its way out onto the Playstation 3 as well as PC Blood Bowl finally coming out on PSP this week as well and there's going to be nothing else I guess that is one hell of a light week

823
00:52:26,053 --> 00:52:29,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's go to... I need to say something real quick.

824
00:52:29,155 --> 00:52:29,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

825
00:52:30,135 --> 00:52:35,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Since I hate having to spell this shit out because apparently I do every time I state something that's my opinion.

826
00:52:35,498 --> 00:52:39,580
[SPEAKER_07]: When I say something is over, I'm typically meaning it's over for me.

827
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:40,401
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.

828
00:52:40,721 --> 00:52:41,161
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gone.

829
00:52:42,062 --> 00:52:46,944
[SPEAKER_09]: So... Okay, well I took what you said to mean that the show is actually over.

830
00:52:47,124 --> 00:52:50,386
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not over, it's just you've written it off because you don't like the direction it's going in.

831
00:52:51,607 --> 00:52:53,368
[SPEAKER_07]: They got rid of everybody.

832
00:52:54,494 --> 00:52:55,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Except for one person.

833
00:52:56,918 --> 00:52:58,581
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing more in that for me to watch.

834
00:52:58,901 --> 00:52:59,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

835
00:52:59,282 --> 00:53:01,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, as someone who doesn't watch the show, I had no idea.

836
00:53:01,605 --> 00:53:02,206
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

837
00:53:03,208 --> 00:53:03,528
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

838
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:05,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Japanese release dates.

839
00:53:05,531 --> 00:53:08,095
[SPEAKER_09]: No More Heroes is coming out on the Xbox 360.

840
00:53:08,135 --> 00:53:08,436
[SPEAKER_09]: So that is...

841
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:15,364
[SPEAKER_09]: and yeah, I'd heard about that that they were going to remake that for the 360 because, you know, mature games don't do very well on the Wii.

842
00:53:15,384 --> 00:53:16,285
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be awesome.

843
00:53:16,345 --> 00:53:25,335
[SPEAKER_09]: So there it is on its way on the 360 this week and there's lots of people like Loki who will probably use his new JTAG not creepy anonymously donated 360 to play.

844
00:53:25,455 --> 00:53:26,176
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be a bomb.

845
00:53:26,196 --> 00:53:27,357
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't opened it up yet.

846
00:53:27,578 --> 00:53:27,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

847
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:30,741
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to get that screen somewhere.

848
00:53:31,161 --> 00:53:31,461
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

849
00:53:31,702 --> 00:53:35,805
[SPEAKER_09]: On the PlayStation 3, also gets a version of No More Heroes as well.

850
00:53:35,905 --> 00:53:37,727
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a pretty dry week otherwise.

851
00:53:37,867 --> 00:53:38,828
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess that's kind of the anchor.

852
00:53:38,848 --> 00:53:39,208
[SPEAKER_09]: And there you go.

853
00:53:39,228 --> 00:53:42,832
[SPEAKER_10]: You can import the PS3 version if you don't have a modded console.

854
00:53:43,292 --> 00:53:45,294
[SPEAKER_09]: That's true because PS3 is region free.

855
00:53:45,454 --> 00:53:47,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, it's all going to be in Japanese, but who cares?

856
00:53:48,597 --> 00:53:49,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Might be able to get through it anyway.

857
00:53:50,118 --> 00:54:10,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo Wii, not a thing this week You gotta wait till the 22nd for really any new games PlayStation 2, Clover no Kune no Alice comes out As well as Saiko Shogi Gakuyashashi Special That's just a price reduction to about the equivalent of 20 bucks in Japan So look for that, that's a gambling game though I mean really, do you guys import gambling games?

858
00:54:10,811 --> 00:54:11,272
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think you do

859
00:54:12,252 --> 00:54:13,112
[SPEAKER_09]: on the Nintendo DS.

860
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:15,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's Science with Marie and Gully.

861
00:54:16,133 --> 00:54:18,353
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a big game coming out this week on the Nintendo DS.

862
00:54:18,373 --> 00:54:19,434
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never heard of this game.

863
00:54:21,374 --> 00:54:22,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's Science.

864
00:54:22,174 --> 00:54:22,454
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

865
00:54:22,474 --> 00:54:23,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that like Science Mama?

866
00:54:24,235 --> 00:54:24,615
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

867
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:28,135
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it has little equations in it and all this other stuff.

868
00:54:29,716 --> 00:54:36,077
[SPEAKER_09]: That is not Cookie Mama.

869
00:54:36,097 --> 00:54:37,717
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it was because I saw Mama in the title.

870
00:54:38,017 --> 00:54:39,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Otoko means boy.

871
00:54:39,578 --> 00:54:40,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's like a little...

872
00:54:40,558 --> 00:54:42,019
[SPEAKER_06]: PSP, Sokoku no Kusabi, Hiro no Kakara 3

873
00:55:04,495 --> 00:55:31,446
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't recognize it it looks like it's based on an anime because it has really pretty cutscene looking things in it a lot of talking and chatting in the game can't tell what that is though sorry I'm not up to speed on all of my Japanese what is this maybe this is it too there's a limited edition of it coming out as well let's try to see if that would tell me what it is nope oh well that's coming out on PSP and that's it for Japanese release dates

874
00:55:33,152 --> 00:55:36,435
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, how about the Old Kingdom?

875
00:55:37,416 --> 00:55:41,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, on the 15th, we have Final Fight Double Impact.

876
00:55:42,201 --> 00:55:46,024
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Sam & Max The Devil's Playground, Episode 1, The Penal Zone.

877
00:55:47,165 --> 00:55:56,174
[SPEAKER_07]: And on the 16th, we have Samurai Shodown Sen, Grand Theft Auto 4, Episodes from Liberty City, and Splinter Cell Conviction.

878
00:55:58,206 --> 00:56:02,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a few more stories for you guys, then we're going to get into the classic game of the week.

879
00:56:02,431 --> 00:56:04,873
[SPEAKER_09]: But first, a few more news stories for you guys.

880
00:56:04,933 --> 00:56:05,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

881
00:56:05,894 --> 00:56:06,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

882
00:56:07,196 --> 00:56:15,625
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, with the new update 3.21 that removes Linux from the PlayStation 3, which is retarded.

883
00:56:16,666 --> 00:56:17,707
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll just tell you right now.

884
00:56:18,127 --> 00:56:18,668
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

885
00:56:33,541 --> 00:56:38,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Since Sony made a big to-do about trying to patch it up, I'm not updating my system until I see what happens.

886
00:56:39,223 --> 00:56:40,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't you kind of have to?

887
00:56:40,323 --> 00:56:49,565
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if you want to play anything online, because it does that whole thing where it says there is a system update available and if you want to connect to PlayStation Network for anything, you have to upgrade.

888
00:56:50,065 --> 00:56:50,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Have to.

889
00:56:51,326 --> 00:56:54,586
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't connect to PlayStation Network because I don't play anything on it.

890
00:56:54,606 --> 00:56:55,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well then you'll be fine.

891
00:56:55,467 --> 00:56:55,967
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just saying.

892
00:56:56,627 --> 00:57:01,168
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, even to have the online leaderboards or anything, you can't

893
00:57:01,808 --> 00:57:03,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Play those without updating.

894
00:57:04,070 --> 00:57:05,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Because my system wasn't updated.

895
00:57:05,351 --> 00:57:07,612
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I haven't really played anything on PlayStation 3 this week.

896
00:57:07,912 --> 00:57:14,697
[SPEAKER_09]: But I went into a game on there the other night to show... Actually, I was showing a friend our little cameo in the Namco Museum game.

897
00:57:15,077 --> 00:57:16,978
[SPEAKER_09]: But that game wants to connect for leaderboards.

898
00:57:17,098 --> 00:57:20,120
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was not working right because it needed me to update.

899
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:22,202
[SPEAKER_09]: That's when you unhook it from the internet.

900
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:24,063
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just saying.

901
00:57:24,103 --> 00:57:25,884
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to be very limited until you update.

902
00:57:26,625 --> 00:57:26,985
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm okay.

903
00:57:27,943 --> 00:57:42,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, so what's important about this is apparently the guy Geohot, who has done different hacks on the iPhone and whatnot, he's I guess one of the first guys that jailbroke some of those I guess, I don't know.

904
00:57:42,939 --> 00:57:57,705
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, so he is now, he put out a video that shows him with a modded 3.21 system with actually the option to install the other OS still.

905
00:57:57,805 --> 00:58:02,787
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically he patched out their patch and just added the update or something.

906
00:58:02,987 --> 00:58:04,468
[SPEAKER_10]: And he says it's very easy to do.

907
00:58:05,608 --> 00:58:10,070
[SPEAKER_10]: But he also says that he's not going to necessarily program anything so that people can, you know,

908
00:58:11,707 --> 00:58:15,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Build like, you know, ways to pirate stuff.

909
00:58:15,978 --> 00:58:19,186
[SPEAKER_10]: But right now it's just doing it for the other operating system.

910
00:58:19,226 --> 00:58:20,008
[SPEAKER_10]: But that makes me wonder.

911
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:21,974
[SPEAKER_10]: How long?

912
00:58:22,215 --> 00:58:25,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's just a matter of time.

913
00:58:25,097 --> 00:58:46,131
[SPEAKER_10]: And in fact, actually, his quote basically is basically saying that because of this, they've potentially turned 100,000 plus legit users into hackers because now they're going to try to find... They weren't caring before about trying to break it to add Linux to it, but now that they're removing it,

914
00:58:47,072 --> 00:58:49,914
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to be more diligent in trying to hack the PS3.

915
00:58:50,514 --> 00:58:55,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it also just seems like no surprise that this was cracked in minutes.

916
00:58:56,078 --> 00:58:57,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that all?

917
00:58:57,620 --> 00:59:06,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Essentially what Sony did is they just released something that didn't actually remove the feature but just removed the menu item or something.

918
00:59:07,387 --> 00:59:10,349
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like this hack was so easy that this guy did.

919
00:59:10,389 --> 00:59:12,911
[SPEAKER_09]: It almost sounds to me like Sony didn't really take it out.

920
00:59:13,271 --> 00:59:15,253
[SPEAKER_09]: They just took out your ability to access it.

921
00:59:15,693 --> 00:59:22,775
[SPEAKER_10]: The PS3 and the PSP, for example, their operating systems are very similar, especially the way their patch files and stuff come over.

922
00:59:24,035 --> 00:59:28,596
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're familiar with the PSP, you're probably going to have an easy way around the PlayStation 3.

923
00:59:28,836 --> 00:59:35,438
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just there are certain things that they haven't figured out yet, and apparently this guy's figured out ways around it.

924
00:59:36,378 --> 00:59:59,510
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, now another kind of story that ties in with this is apparently there was a guy, um, a European PS3 owner who, um, received, I guess, a credit for, um, you know, about 84 pounds, I guess, from Amazon because he filed a complaint with the retailer saying that the firmware update violated some sort of, uh, European law.

925
01:00:00,951 --> 01:00:05,052
[SPEAKER_10]: and basically saying that the console no longer performed as advertised.

926
01:00:05,352 --> 01:00:05,772
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know what?

927
01:00:05,932 --> 01:00:07,713
[SPEAKER_10]: And I do think that is something, though.

928
01:00:07,753 --> 01:00:12,854
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if you're putting on the box or you had on the box, now they have all these slim systems and stuff.

929
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:16,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Before you go there, in the U.S., it's not on the box.

930
01:00:16,695 --> 01:00:22,576
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't speak for the U.K., but I only know this because last week on Bobby's show, because right before the call, he actually had the box and he said it's not on the box.

931
01:00:24,408 --> 01:00:26,709
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know about the UK, but the US.

932
01:00:49,006 --> 01:00:57,750
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still, no matter how insignificant it is, it still sucks that they removed it because, I mean, this is something you may be paying for.

933
01:00:57,910 --> 01:01:09,476
[SPEAKER_10]: Granted, it's not a feature that I use, but that'd be the same thing if, like, oh, well, I don't really watch Blu-ray movies on my, you know, PS3, and then they send a patch over that, you know, now prevents me from watching Blu-ray movies.

934
01:01:10,276 --> 01:01:15,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Granted, say it wasn't a feature I was using, that's still, like, you're removing a feature off the console.

935
01:01:18,524 --> 01:01:19,726
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, people should be pissed.

936
01:01:20,106 --> 01:01:27,915
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, granted, they're doing this for security reasons, but what if they find a way around something else?

937
01:01:28,696 --> 01:01:30,218
[SPEAKER_10]: What other features are going to be removed?

938
01:01:32,791 --> 01:01:33,211
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

939
01:01:33,992 --> 01:01:37,014
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a case of a couple bad apples ruining the barrel, I think.

940
01:01:37,054 --> 01:01:47,400
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think it was a little silly for Sony to put that feature in in the first place if they're closing it up because of piracy.

941
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,841
[SPEAKER_09]: Because didn't Linux kind of lend itself to piracy anyway?

942
01:01:49,861 --> 01:01:54,644
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not talking about PS3 necessarily, but everybody knew there was emulators out there for the NES and, you know...

943
01:01:55,031 --> 01:02:02,775
[SPEAKER_10]: But, see, now, though, with Linux installed on these systems, they can sell, you know, a ton of them to different, like, universities or whatever, using them as number crunchers.

944
01:02:03,255 --> 01:02:05,877
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an easy way to make up some console sales, you know?

945
01:02:06,057 --> 01:02:08,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Just, uh, hey, look, you can run Linux on it.

946
01:02:08,238 --> 01:02:10,159
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a little portable supercomputer.

947
01:02:10,199 --> 01:02:13,901
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, they were even saying, oh, yeah, it's, you know, it's a computer system.

948
01:02:13,961 --> 01:02:15,022
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not a game system.

949
01:02:15,062 --> 01:02:16,222
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a computer system.

950
01:02:17,023 --> 01:02:21,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, you know, of course, the rumors were that they were doing that to evade taxes or whatever.

951
01:02:22,185 --> 01:02:22,886
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um...

952
01:02:25,188 --> 01:02:26,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Still though, now you're...

953
01:02:28,743 --> 01:02:29,103
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

954
01:02:30,885 --> 01:02:40,372
[SPEAKER_10]: They can do whatever they want, I guess, because since the end user license agreement anyways just basically says you're leasing the console from them, so if they want to take features away, I guess they can.

955
01:02:40,752 --> 01:02:51,360
[SPEAKER_10]: But as a consumer, I will probably think twice when it comes to the next PlayStation system that they are advertising can do such and such things.

956
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:55,243
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll probably think twice, hey, what are they going to remove later?

957
01:02:55,923 --> 01:02:57,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it doesn't go their way.

958
01:02:59,341 --> 01:03:01,542
[SPEAKER_09]: It is very interesting that they can just kind of do that.

959
01:03:01,862 --> 01:03:10,424
[SPEAKER_09]: And we all accept that because it's in the agreements that we hit A to get through real fast on the Xbox.

960
01:03:12,384 --> 01:03:13,344
[SPEAKER_09]: It just seems, I don't know.

961
01:03:15,765 --> 01:03:19,966
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, if you ever happen to click no, then you just don't get to use it, right?

962
01:03:20,006 --> 01:03:20,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

963
01:03:20,186 --> 01:03:20,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

964
01:03:21,629 --> 01:03:21,970
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

965
01:03:23,911 --> 01:03:26,734
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just kind of sad there's nothing to protect me.

966
01:03:27,714 --> 01:03:30,477
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be different if it was just connecting to their online service.

967
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:35,261
[SPEAKER_10]: And I understand, yes, they can prevent you from going to their online service for whatever reason.

968
01:03:35,301 --> 01:03:37,302
[SPEAKER_10]: If they want you to update and you don't want to, then fine.

969
01:03:37,343 --> 01:03:38,804
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't connect to their online service.

970
01:03:39,444 --> 01:03:45,787
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, offline games, if you pop in a game or whatever, it will just automatically patch your system up anyways.

971
01:03:46,207 --> 01:03:48,668
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't just say, no, I don't want to install this patch.

972
01:03:49,008 --> 01:03:50,329
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to do it regardless.

973
01:03:51,029 --> 01:04:03,895
[SPEAKER_10]: And they do it, obviously, as a security feature so that, you know, you can't go and hack the PlayStation 3, but... Whatever, then maybe they should have figured out a way to be able to leave that operating system on there and not have it, you know...

974
01:04:05,413 --> 01:04:10,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Have access to whatever that's on the PlayStation 3 that you can apparently hack the system with.

975
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:12,801
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

976
01:04:13,102 --> 01:04:21,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, turning to something that is an old standby and reliable, and you know these are always coming and not going to get taken away from you, Pokemon.

977
01:04:21,831 --> 01:04:22,292
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

978
01:04:22,632 --> 01:04:25,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Taking a step over to the Nintendo systems, Pokemon.

979
01:04:25,956 --> 01:04:26,416
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

980
01:04:46,305 --> 01:05:08,008
[SPEAKER_09]: They are going to be coming out this fall in Japan for the Nintendo DS That is DS, not the 3DS So these are still games I mean, obviously the 3DS will play them As we know about the 3DS so far But these games are being developed for the DS More info is supposed to come in the next few weeks But the game is supposed to be out in fall And I imagine we'll see some of this at E3 as well The logo design is gorgeous

981
01:05:08,655 --> 01:05:12,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though the games probably won't come out in America for some time What is so gorgeous about the design for you?

982
01:05:12,538 --> 01:05:34,475
[SPEAKER_09]: I just like it, I just really like it It's popping, I have this thing for black and white And just with the red Pokeball in the background I think it's actually really eye-catching and really well done It's very interesting that they decided just to go with black and white Like, you know, just very plain colors, if you will None of this like ruby, sapphire, emerald, just black and white

983
01:05:34,915 --> 01:05:42,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, I think using black and white is I always thought of just using black and white as being more classy.

984
01:05:43,956 --> 01:05:45,818
[SPEAKER_07]: than going for the sparkly poo.

985
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:47,940
[SPEAKER_09]: So a classier, more refined Pokemon?

986
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:48,621
[SPEAKER_09]: I think so.

987
01:05:48,641 --> 01:05:57,952
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that it takes a lot more talent to... I mean, I prefer things being pretty clean in how they're done.

988
01:05:59,133 --> 01:06:00,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, I like the logo.

989
01:06:01,836 --> 01:06:05,460
[SPEAKER_07]: The fact that I could actually look at it and read it right away, I was kind of impressed with myself.

990
01:06:06,238 --> 01:06:09,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft in our chatroom says the third version is going to be gray.

991
01:06:11,381 --> 01:06:13,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Make it easy, huh?

992
01:06:13,062 --> 01:06:14,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, so more Pokemon.

993
01:06:14,483 --> 01:06:19,787
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just kind of surprised this information is coming out so soon after the release of the games we just had here.

994
01:06:19,927 --> 01:06:25,350
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the same time, we have to remember this news was tailored for Japan, not really for the U.S.

995
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:27,211
[SPEAKER_09]: And those games have been out in Japan for some time.

996
01:06:27,251 --> 01:06:32,875
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of like the news about the 3DS came out, what, like the day that the DSi XL was released here?

997
01:06:35,726 --> 01:06:51,012
[SPEAKER_10]: interesting we can only learn from like you know another game company that has announced a revision to their system right as they're launching their system hmm that hasn't happened before has it oh wait no it has yeah

998
01:06:52,557 --> 01:06:56,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Bochiko on our chatroom says classy Pokemon, a squirrel in a top hat with a cane.

999
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:58,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Possibly.

1000
01:06:58,921 --> 01:07:00,622
[SPEAKER_09]: And Frisbee in chat says there's my problem.

1001
01:07:00,682 --> 01:07:08,187
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if I should buy black or white or wait for gray since it's inevitable that there will be a third version as well.

1002
01:07:09,468 --> 01:07:10,008
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1003
01:07:37,842 --> 01:07:48,629
[SPEAKER_09]: Every week here on the show we like to take a look at gaming's past and take a trip to the classic vault and look at the classic video game of the week where DarkSakura will pick one game from the archives and she says, you know what?

1004
01:07:49,069 --> 01:07:58,575
[SPEAKER_09]: You ungrateful kids playing with your Pokemans all day and collecting your mudkips you should take some time out to pay tribute to those that paved the way for these games.

1005
01:07:58,935 --> 01:07:59,876
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the classic game of the week.

1006
01:07:59,916 --> 01:08:01,517
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, what did you pick for the kids tonight?

1007
01:08:02,458 --> 01:08:04,159
[SPEAKER_07]: The game I have chosen is Summer Showdown 2.

1008
01:08:06,627 --> 01:08:07,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Samurai Shodown 2

1009
01:08:36,196 --> 01:08:42,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it also has a bunch of Easter eggs in it, which I think is absolutely fun, and has the POW meter.

1010
01:08:42,819 --> 01:08:43,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, POW.

1011
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:47,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I actually own this game on Neo Geo.

1012
01:08:47,542 --> 01:08:48,222
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the cartridge.

1013
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:57,428
[SPEAKER_07]: I will technically, I have the Japanese cartridge, but you know, you can actually switch your country of origin on it and it changes your blood to sweat and back and forth.

1014
01:08:58,570 --> 01:09:00,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, this is from the Japanese version, clearly.

1015
01:09:01,893 --> 01:09:03,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there's blood everywhere.

1016
01:09:03,975 --> 01:09:05,757
[SPEAKER_07]: It's white sweat for the US one, so...

1017
01:09:06,838 --> 01:09:09,339
[SPEAKER_07]: But this one had some of the best characters in it.

1018
01:09:10,199 --> 01:09:15,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, like, I have to say three of my favorite characters came about in this game.

1019
01:09:17,122 --> 01:09:21,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Kiba-Gami Genjuro, who was Hau Maru's rival.

1020
01:09:22,644 --> 01:09:25,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Cham-Cham, who replaced Tam-Tam, the little cat girl.

1021
01:09:26,666 --> 01:09:27,266
[SPEAKER_07]: And she was fun.

1022
01:09:27,286 --> 01:09:28,607
[SPEAKER_07]: She had, like, the giant boomerang.

1023
01:09:28,767 --> 01:09:30,728
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know that she's been in anything else.

1024
01:09:30,748 --> 01:09:31,548
[SPEAKER_07]: She was fantastic.

1025
01:09:33,909 --> 01:09:34,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Nighthawk Saiger

1026
01:10:02,489 --> 01:10:04,150
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say Japanese theater.

1027
01:10:04,591 --> 01:10:08,575
[SPEAKER_07]: A Kuroko is like a stagehand.

1028
01:10:09,235 --> 01:10:14,661
[SPEAKER_07]: The person who goes behind the scenes and wears all black so that you don't... He's supposed to be invisible.

1029
01:10:15,161 --> 01:10:17,824
[SPEAKER_07]: He'll be like a prop or something or change scenery.

1030
01:10:18,024 --> 01:10:21,645
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a really cool music video that uses all that.

1031
01:10:21,865 --> 01:10:26,047
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a Scissor Sisters video and I can't remember what song it was, but they do that.

1032
01:10:26,987 --> 01:10:28,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Except that he's not on a black screen.

1033
01:10:29,328 --> 01:10:32,229
[SPEAKER_07]: He's just a dude in black hanging out by the scenery.

1034
01:10:32,749 --> 01:10:34,729
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like what I would do in Rocky before.

1035
01:10:35,610 --> 01:10:36,650
[SPEAKER_07]: I was the curtain.

1036
01:10:37,990 --> 01:10:38,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1037
01:10:39,691 --> 01:10:42,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Rob used to climb up on me a couple of times.

1038
01:10:43,550 --> 01:10:49,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's not give the listeners the wrong impression of our friendship.

1039
01:10:49,832 --> 01:10:59,734
[SPEAKER_07]: There was also a female boss in the game named Rashojin Mizuki.

1040
01:11:01,295 --> 01:11:02,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Amakusa was not female.

1041
01:11:03,135 --> 01:11:04,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Amakusa was just a really girly dude.

1042
01:11:05,836 --> 01:11:12,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you also, um, had, um, a blocking and a parry technique.

1043
01:11:13,701 --> 01:11:25,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, basically, you would, you know, push against sword to sword, you'd lock, and then whoever came across it could get in a hit that was unlockable.

1044
01:11:26,129 --> 01:11:28,231
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, they actually borrowed that for Street Fighter 3.

1045
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:31,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the kind of parry thing, the parry thing in Street Fighter 3 was different.

1046
01:11:31,573 --> 01:11:31,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1047
01:11:32,533 --> 01:11:39,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you, um, there were cameos from other SNK characters and different stuff would happen.

1048
01:11:40,679 --> 01:11:47,263
[SPEAKER_07]: My favorite Easter eggs, though, was like this weird little move that you could do with each of the characters that would make them chibi.

1049
01:11:47,663 --> 01:11:50,165
[SPEAKER_07]: They'd just be little chibi cutesy versions.

1050
01:11:50,265 --> 01:11:51,626
[SPEAKER_07]: They would just show up chibi.

1051
01:11:52,908 --> 01:11:53,529
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1052
01:12:09,726 --> 01:12:12,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, to me, it's one of my favorite games ever.

1053
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:14,250
[SPEAKER_07]: It's up there.

1054
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:15,872
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd put this up there in the top ten.

1055
01:12:15,912 --> 01:12:17,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably one of my favorite fighting games ever.

1056
01:12:20,436 --> 01:12:28,523
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as versions that came out, it only came out on Neo Geo for the longest time.

1057
01:12:30,044 --> 01:12:34,808
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there was the Neo Geo CD version came out for Windows.

1058
01:12:35,709 --> 01:12:36,130
[SPEAKER_07]: And then...

1059
01:12:38,241 --> 01:12:39,942
[SPEAKER_07]: That version actually came out in the U.S.

1060
01:12:40,543 --> 01:12:47,988
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a PlayStation version that came out in Sadamai Spirit's Kenkaku Shinan Pack, which was the first two, and it only came out in Japan.

1061
01:12:48,548 --> 01:12:57,274
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the 2007 Tokyo Game Show, there was an Xbox Live Arcade and a PS2 Wii Anthology were announced.

1062
01:12:57,374 --> 01:13:02,397
[SPEAKER_07]: So... It's...

1063
01:13:04,703 --> 01:13:06,405
[SPEAKER_07]: This is seriously a fantastic game.

1064
01:13:07,366 --> 01:13:09,128
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of, like I said, one of my favorites.

1065
01:13:09,889 --> 01:13:14,695
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think out of all of them, the only... Actually, no, I'd probably say that this one is my favorite.

1066
01:13:15,356 --> 01:13:21,663
[SPEAKER_07]: The only reason that I would actually sometimes pick Summer Tread on 3 over 2 sometimes is just to play as Rimuru.

1067
01:13:22,083 --> 01:13:24,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Because she had the ice... Rimuru?

1068
01:13:24,826 --> 01:13:25,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Rimuru?

1069
01:13:29,410 --> 01:13:30,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Bite Me Rob.

1070
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:32,090
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the name is Bite Me Rob.

1071
01:13:32,730 --> 01:13:35,151
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'll go grab my cartridge in a second, but that's it.

1072
01:13:36,371 --> 01:13:40,472
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Samurai Showdown 2.

1073
01:13:41,512 --> 01:13:42,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Not 1, not 3, 2.

1074
01:13:43,813 --> 01:13:47,574
[SPEAKER_09]: But you'll probably see 1 and 3 in future weeks when Jamie starts running out of games.

1075
01:13:47,734 --> 01:13:48,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you've been doing this a while now.

1076
01:13:48,994 --> 01:13:52,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Gosh, this is probably like the 100th game of the week, if not more.

1077
01:13:52,115 --> 01:13:52,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob.

1078
01:13:52,455 --> 01:13:52,615
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1079
01:13:53,015 --> 01:13:54,496
[SPEAKER_07]: You've seen The Vault.

1080
01:13:54,656 --> 01:13:54,936
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1081
01:13:55,296 --> 01:13:58,097
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a couple thousand games in there.

1082
01:13:58,357 --> 01:13:59,457
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to run out.

1083
01:14:00,298 --> 01:14:00,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1084
01:14:02,058 --> 01:14:02,579
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

1085
01:14:02,799 --> 01:14:05,400
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be scraping the obscure if you really want to get to it.

1086
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:07,500
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you going to do when you run out of Sega?

1087
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,561
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think I'm going to run out of Sega.

1088
01:14:11,122 --> 01:14:11,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we'll see.

1089
01:14:12,188 --> 01:14:15,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, anyhow, for now though, we're going to take a quick break, but we'll come back.

1090
01:14:15,251 --> 01:14:16,792
[SPEAKER_09]: There's still plenty more to talk about tonight.

1091
01:14:16,832 --> 01:14:20,415
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we haven't even touched the big iPhone news this week, and yes, it does affect gaming.

1092
01:14:20,755 --> 01:14:22,316
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to talk some Red Dead Redemption.

1093
01:14:22,336 --> 01:14:24,378
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like hammer-rum-rum-rum-rum-rum-rum-rum.

1094
01:14:27,833 --> 01:14:36,062
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to talk about some of the Microsoft changes to live that are going to be kind of interesting, especially for those of you that like to play games on the computer.

1095
01:14:36,843 --> 01:14:39,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Talk about a lot of that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1096
01:14:39,686 --> 01:14:40,967
[SPEAKER_09]: So stick around, folks.

1097
01:14:41,067 --> 01:14:42,249
[SPEAKER_09]: We will be right back.

1098
01:14:45,871 --> 01:14:49,517
[SPEAKER_09]: And for those of you guys listening live tonight on All Games Radio, we're going to take a quick music break.

1099
01:14:49,938 --> 01:14:50,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Stay tuned with us.

1100
01:14:50,659 --> 01:14:53,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a little bit of potpourri of music tonight to listen to.

1101
01:14:53,243 --> 01:14:58,693
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to be back in a few minutes while we just take a second to rest our voices and so forth with more of Horizons Radio.

1102
01:14:58,773 --> 01:14:59,314
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be right back.

1103
01:15:05,996 --> 01:15:12,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome back everybody to more of Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday night, April the 11th of 2010.

1104
01:15:13,682 --> 01:15:17,004
[SPEAKER_09]: We're joining you for our 362nd episode of the show.

1105
01:15:17,044 --> 01:15:19,246
[SPEAKER_09]: We're into Part B right now, the second half of our show.

1106
01:15:19,766 --> 01:15:22,568
[SPEAKER_09]: We have some rapid fire news coming up and of course Twitter topics.

1107
01:15:22,688 --> 01:15:24,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Just got a few more minutes to get those in.

1108
01:15:24,170 --> 01:15:25,090
[SPEAKER_09]: We already have quite a few though.

1109
01:15:25,130 --> 01:15:28,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to ask us something on Twitter.

1110
01:15:29,313 --> 01:15:36,820
[SPEAKER_09]: And still some more news to get to in tonight's program Lots and lots of good stuff Loki, why don't you help kick it off with some rapid fire news

1111
01:15:37,136 --> 01:15:44,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, as it's been kind of a trend lately, there's been a lot of good games coming to the Xbox indie game service.

1112
01:15:45,678 --> 01:15:51,739
[SPEAKER_10]: And actually, kind of not a stranger to doing some of these smaller indie games out there.

1113
01:15:51,799 --> 01:15:55,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Gameloft, they have decided to put a game on there called Tank Battles.

1114
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:56,900
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, it's pretty sweet.

1115
01:15:57,420 --> 01:16:04,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Very kind of a high-quality tank battling game, almost like a souped-up combat, if you will.

1116
01:16:04,722 --> 01:16:09,464
[SPEAKER_10]: How many of those games from the indie games have crossed over to regular Xbox Live?

1117
01:16:09,484 --> 01:16:10,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Hasn't there been like one?

1118
01:16:10,144 --> 01:16:10,244
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1119
01:16:33,856 --> 01:16:39,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh... Weren't they saying some time ago that there were going to be more that would cross over to actual games, or am I just making stuff up?

1120
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:44,863
[SPEAKER_10]: They do, like, a contest, I want to say, each year, and there's some that come out of that.

1121
01:16:45,363 --> 01:16:46,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, one a year!

1122
01:16:46,804 --> 01:16:50,086
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, no, not... They do a contest once a year.

1123
01:16:50,126 --> 01:16:52,608
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't necessarily port just one game from that.

1124
01:16:53,428 --> 01:16:54,749
[SPEAKER_10]: Um... But...

1125
01:16:56,149 --> 01:17:23,400
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see a lot of them coming over the Xbox Live Arcade but I don't really think it needs to because especially when those ones that do win the contest they do get singled out on you can select I think contest winners or competition winners or whatever and you can actually see those and then also of course now with the new rating system and stuff it allows games that are actually pretty good to make it to the forefront so people can sort through all the hundreds of games that are on there so

1126
01:17:25,401 --> 01:17:53,009
[SPEAKER_10]: um it's not horrible I don't know it's getting better that's for sure um lots more games are coming out on there um now one game that we of course are not going to probably see on indie games but perhaps an Xbox Live Arcade release or maybe something on the PlayStation Network who knows um Rocket Knight another game coming out um of course you may remember Rocket Knight I believe was an old Konami franchise and um

1127
01:17:53,829 --> 01:17:54,129
[SPEAKER_10]: and DarkSakura.

1128
01:18:21,636 --> 01:18:21,916
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1129
01:18:22,957 --> 01:18:32,944
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, I don't know if the screen... It's kind of souped up looking, so obviously the screenshots probably don't bring back any memories of the original game, but it looks neat.

1130
01:18:33,525 --> 01:18:33,845
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1131
01:18:34,225 --> 01:18:35,146
[SPEAKER_10]: So, that'll be coming out.

1132
01:18:35,746 --> 01:18:38,148
[SPEAKER_10]: And then finally...

1133
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:44,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Another Xbox Live Arcade game, and also going to be coming on Steam as well.

1134
01:18:45,424 --> 01:18:52,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Serious Sam HD, the second encounter, is of course getting its brand new HD remake, I guess.

1135
01:18:53,350 --> 01:18:57,033
[SPEAKER_10]: And should be coming to Xbox Live soon.

1136
01:18:58,594 --> 01:19:05,399
[SPEAKER_10]: They haven't really made an official date yet for Xbox Live Arcade, but the Steam version is supposed to be coming out around April 28th.

1137
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:12,107
[SPEAKER_10]: and, of course, the PC version on Steam will be available for $17.99.

1138
01:19:13,488 --> 01:19:17,993
[SPEAKER_10]: And I guess that'll be, if you pre-order it, otherwise it's going to be $20.

1139
01:19:18,674 --> 01:19:25,882
[SPEAKER_10]: No word on exactly what it's going to cost, of course, on Xbox Evercade, but probably somewhere around that, maybe $15.

1140
01:19:27,484 --> 01:19:36,170
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, Ranma in our chatroom is clarifying, just in case you didn't know, Rock Ignite Adventures was on the Sega Genesis, and the sequel Sparkster was on the Super Nintendo and Genesis.

1141
01:19:36,410 --> 01:19:39,412
[SPEAKER_09]: So Sparkster was the original sequel.

1142
01:19:40,152 --> 01:19:43,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, I got some other rapid quick stories for you guys.

1143
01:19:43,694 --> 01:19:45,816
[SPEAKER_09]: A couple items around Rock Band.

1144
01:19:46,196 --> 01:19:53,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, the weekly Rock Band releases, the songs that are coming out on Rock Band this week, either on the 13th or the 15th, depending on what system you're on.

1145
01:19:54,902 --> 01:20:10,854
[SPEAKER_09]: The Used will be releasing the songs Blood on My Hands, Born to Quit, and The Taste of Ink and some individual tracks from Surge, Tonkin, Empty Walls, and Sky is Over as well as All Star by Smash Mouth if you haven't heard that song 500 times in 1999 you can hear it all over again

1146
01:20:14,296 --> 01:20:14,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Green Day Green Day

1147
01:20:36,296 --> 01:20:48,061
[SPEAKER_09]: The songs that will be in the game, I'm not going to name them all, but I will just say it almost looks like most of the Dookie album, American Idiot, and 21st Century Breakdown, almost like all those albums seem to be there.

1148
01:20:48,081 --> 01:20:51,042
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there are some tracks missing, but the big, big components of those albums.

1149
01:20:51,762 --> 01:21:00,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, from Warning, there's Minority and Warning, Nimrod has Hitch and a Ride, Good Riddance, Time of Your Life, you know, when you need that slow jam, that quintessential goodbye song.

1150
01:21:01,027 --> 01:21:05,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice Guys Finish Last, and then Insomniac has Brain Stew, Jaded, and Geek Stink Breath.

1151
01:21:07,133 --> 01:21:10,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Downloadable content includes 21 Guns and so forth.

1152
01:21:11,577 --> 01:21:12,378
[SPEAKER_09]: A few songs there.

1153
01:21:13,259 --> 01:21:19,806
[SPEAKER_09]: And then lastly for you guys, Squeenix has some Final Fantasy XIV updates this week, including some of the races and clan information.

1154
01:21:20,926 --> 01:21:48,600
[SPEAKER_09]: basically your races can boil down into these different clans so you can play one of the not Galka but they're actually called Rogadins now you can actually be like a seawolf fisherman type of Galka I keep wanting to call them Galkas but I guess they're Rogadins now or you can be like a fire type Hellsguard clan so it's like all the races now have clans too so you have like a specialized sort of place that your race comes from well I'm glad they actually changed something other than the names

1155
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:55,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's the other big thing is that some more information came out that's out there on the internet and your characters have like first and last names now.

1156
01:21:56,603 --> 01:22:02,265
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of instances play into the game apparently where you get your own copy of the world.

1157
01:22:02,306 --> 01:22:07,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, the game is sounding more and more like Final Fantasy XI meets not Warcraft but Guild Wars.

1158
01:22:08,228 --> 01:22:11,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I seriously think the game that they're making is like Final Fantasy XIV Guild Wars.

1159
01:22:11,969 --> 01:22:13,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that sounds playable.

1160
01:22:13,730 --> 01:22:39,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Just make it so I don't have to pay an online fee like Guild Wars and I'm there Sadly I don't think that part but there's screens from the alpha that are leaking out there now and you can see I'll have to show you the website here in Studio Loki and Jamie if you want to see it too but definitely look like your items are on like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 like you push the button to do the attack now like it's a little more wow-ish or Guild Wars was kind of the same way so very curious to see how this plays out

1161
01:22:39,545 --> 01:22:45,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, as long as I can do it with a controller, because I kind of miss playing with a controller.

1162
01:22:45,849 --> 01:22:53,334
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if they're developing it for PS3, then I'm sure controller will be... I mean, but it'll be weird, because I don't know if you'll be able to put in just any old controller, or what you'll have to do.

1163
01:22:53,374 --> 01:22:55,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Break out the old Gravis pad, do it the old school way.

1164
01:22:55,874 --> 01:22:56,435
[SPEAKER_09]: It should be fine.

1165
01:22:57,136 --> 01:22:57,836
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see what happens.

1166
01:22:57,936 --> 01:23:00,860
[SPEAKER_09]: More to come when the beta for that is released.

1167
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:04,644
[SPEAKER_09]: But meanwhile, we just have stuff leaking out from the alpha.

1168
01:23:04,704 --> 01:23:11,732
[SPEAKER_09]: While Jamie does her quick stories here, I'll pull up that website that somebody texted me here in studio and show you guys the screenshots.

1169
01:23:12,133 --> 01:23:14,015
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll post it in chat if anyone actually cares.

1170
01:23:14,758 --> 01:23:36,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, some kid who is on Facebook plays Farmville and used their parents' credit card to run up a 905-pound tab, basically about $1,300, $1,400 to pay for stuff.

1171
01:23:36,712 --> 01:23:40,515
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess he took his mother's credit card and put it in.

1172
01:23:42,537 --> 01:23:58,000
[SPEAKER_07]: and uh spent all that money so they're trying to figure something out on it I guess I just think I hate I hate Farmville anyway I think it's a waste of time I mean I know people like it they want to do it fine but if you got kids that play it watch out for your credit card

1173
01:23:58,240 --> 01:23:58,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1174
01:24:15,589 --> 01:24:16,330
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1175
01:24:32,845 --> 01:24:33,726
[SPEAKER_07]: So is it Facetron?

1176
01:24:50,319 --> 01:24:51,620
[SPEAKER_09]: that doesn't work so much.

1177
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:53,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, that's been kind of a pattern of South Park lately.

1178
01:24:53,902 --> 01:24:57,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, the first 15 minutes are hilarious, and the second 15 minutes are not nearly as funny.

1179
01:24:57,604 --> 01:25:00,686
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's kind of, sadly, the Tron part, not as funny as the rest of it.

1180
01:25:00,746 --> 01:25:02,288
[SPEAKER_09]: But I thought it was awesome they referenced it.

1181
01:25:02,368 --> 01:25:03,108
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Tron, though.

1182
01:25:03,468 --> 01:25:03,729
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1183
01:25:05,470 --> 01:25:09,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Namco Bandai is doing something really neat.

1184
01:25:09,693 --> 01:25:14,957
[SPEAKER_07]: We're getting Splatterhouse on, I guess they're doing a...

1185
01:25:17,290 --> 01:25:19,372
[SPEAKER_07]: They're doing a new game that got delayed and delayed.

1186
01:25:19,793 --> 01:25:20,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Saying that?

1187
01:25:21,194 --> 01:25:21,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

1188
01:25:23,417 --> 01:25:23,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1189
01:25:26,028 --> 01:25:34,334
[SPEAKER_07]: As I was trying to say, they're doing a new Splatterhouse and they're going to put the original trilogy on the disc.

1190
01:25:35,355 --> 01:25:37,937
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess this is a little fun compilation to add on to that.

1191
01:25:40,259 --> 01:25:48,985
[SPEAKER_07]: It will have the original arcade version of Splatterhouse, as in the uncensored one, and then Splatterhouse 2 and Splatterhouse 3 that were the Genesis versions.

1192
01:25:50,526 --> 01:25:52,328
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that'll be pretty fun.

1193
01:25:55,951 --> 01:26:06,461
[SPEAKER_07]: I have it, but I haven't played it in so long that I'd have to break it out and see I don't recall it really being that censored

1194
01:26:10,826 --> 01:26:26,696
[SPEAKER_07]: and then we have for Xbox Live in April Final Fight and Mega Man 10 download content basically it's Final Fight Double Impact and that's going to be on April 14th

1195
01:26:28,437 --> 01:26:41,364
[SPEAKER_07]: and then there will be the mall half-priced on April 12th and then two add-ons for Mega Man 10 which is base and special stage one base also known as Forte

1196
01:26:42,574 --> 01:26:43,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Final Fantasy Devil Impacts

1197
01:27:07,194 --> 01:27:13,801
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no new game this week because they're too busy shutting down Xbox service on April 15th.

1198
01:27:14,022 --> 01:27:14,843
[SPEAKER_09]: It's gone.

1199
01:27:14,903 --> 01:27:15,463
[SPEAKER_09]: It's out there.

1200
01:27:15,924 --> 01:27:17,065
[SPEAKER_10]: So get your taxes done.

1201
01:27:17,886 --> 01:27:19,508
[SPEAKER_09]: And get your last Halo 2 game in.

1202
01:27:19,708 --> 01:27:21,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless you're going to play on PC from here on out.

1203
01:27:21,891 --> 01:27:24,754
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope we get a patch so we get our 100 plus friends now.

1204
01:27:25,655 --> 01:27:32,343
[SPEAKER_09]: It's weird though because they already had the big patch for the USB support this past week, so I don't know if there's going to be another one.

1205
01:27:32,984 --> 01:27:40,412
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you heard, and I can't remember if we're talking about it, I don't think we are, but you heard that that uncrippled the hard drive set of consoles that got banned.

1206
01:27:41,594 --> 01:27:41,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh?

1207
01:27:41,694 --> 01:27:41,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1208
01:27:42,065 --> 01:27:43,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that patch did.

1209
01:27:43,846 --> 01:27:44,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

1210
01:27:44,426 --> 01:27:45,947
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think that is interesting.

1211
01:27:47,447 --> 01:27:50,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, I wanted to quickly answer some questions from chat.

1212
01:27:50,749 --> 01:27:56,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Chat.orange.radio.com, Frisbee's asking in reference to the South Park episode, what did you think about the chat roulette part?

1213
01:27:56,231 --> 01:27:57,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I forgot that they make chat roulette.

1214
01:27:57,532 --> 01:27:59,133
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't even realize that was a real site.

1215
01:27:59,173 --> 01:28:00,173
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually had to check that.

1216
01:28:00,193 --> 01:28:01,754
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, holy crap, that's a real site.

1217
01:28:01,834 --> 01:28:09,317
[SPEAKER_09]: The only way that I know that's a real site is that I've seen the YouTube of the guy that, well, I've seen a couple YouTubes.

1218
01:28:09,377 --> 01:28:10,578
[SPEAKER_09]: The guy that does the piano

1219
01:28:11,598 --> 01:28:12,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Penis, penis, penis, penis.

1220
01:28:37,089 --> 01:28:44,980
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it was funny, but it was kind of one of those things where the joke got old, and then they kept saying it over and over again for another three minutes, and I was like, okay, I'm over it.

1221
01:28:46,022 --> 01:28:47,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Chat roulette, not a site.

1222
01:28:47,764 --> 01:28:49,145
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm barely on AIM and Skype.

1223
01:28:49,185 --> 01:28:50,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Why would I go on chat roulette and talk to strangers?

1224
01:28:50,866 --> 01:28:52,827
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't even talk to my friends online.

1225
01:28:55,029 --> 01:28:56,270
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to go on chat roulette.

1226
01:28:58,472 --> 01:28:59,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get to some Twitter topics.

1227
01:28:59,933 --> 01:29:01,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Every week we let you guys ask questions on Twitter.

1228
01:29:01,974 --> 01:29:03,696
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems like every podcast does this now.

1229
01:29:04,196 --> 01:29:05,657
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been listening to more podcasts lately.

1230
01:29:05,737 --> 01:29:07,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody has a damn Twitter segment now.

1231
01:29:08,139 --> 01:29:09,480
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to think we were one of the first.

1232
01:29:10,621 --> 01:29:11,962
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like we were one of the first Skype shows.

1233
01:29:14,156 --> 01:29:14,676
[SPEAKER_09]: But whatever.

1234
01:29:15,476 --> 01:29:23,658
[SPEAKER_09]: It's awesome because it's our listeners and they ask some crazy ass questions sometimes and share some stories with us that we might otherwise miss on the show.

1235
01:29:23,678 --> 01:29:24,739
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the other very important thing.

1236
01:29:25,239 --> 01:29:28,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Redertainment asks, games to play while drunk?

1237
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:29,740
[SPEAKER_09]: And go.

1238
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:32,281
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd play DDR drunk.

1239
01:29:33,481 --> 01:29:35,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Rock band if Jamie's party yesterday was any indication.

1240
01:29:35,761 --> 01:29:36,602
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't really drunk.

1241
01:29:39,002 --> 01:29:39,642
[SPEAKER_09]: You weren't drunk.

1242
01:29:39,662 --> 01:29:41,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Karaoke games would be kind of funny.

1243
01:29:42,287 --> 01:29:42,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

1244
01:30:01,005 --> 01:30:14,522
[SPEAKER_09]: That he's playing right now Robot Unicorn Attack, there you go Actdeft says Konami is distributing Latin American made game Lucha Libre AAA Heroes Del Ring in America Ironically, it's not coming out in Mexico

1245
01:30:19,043 --> 01:30:19,323
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1246
01:30:19,524 --> 01:30:20,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe another developer is putting it out there.

1247
01:30:20,944 --> 01:30:21,284
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1248
01:30:21,324 --> 01:30:25,465
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you like your Mexican wrestling, which it is kind of a niche thing, but it's pretty cool.

1249
01:30:26,085 --> 01:30:28,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and it's actual stars of AAA wrestling.

1250
01:30:29,146 --> 01:30:34,307
[SPEAKER_09]: El Elegido, Abismo Negro, Psycho Clown, Electroshock, like actual... And Charlie Manson.

1251
01:30:34,327 --> 01:30:35,648
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a wrestler named Charlie Manson.

1252
01:30:36,248 --> 01:30:36,468
[SPEAKER_09]: That's...

1253
01:30:37,508 --> 01:30:39,569
[SPEAKER_09]: A little close to a certain serial killer.

1254
01:30:40,749 --> 01:30:41,229
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

1255
01:30:42,230 --> 01:30:43,110
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's on purpose.

1256
01:30:43,190 --> 01:30:44,550
[SPEAKER_09]: You might remember Konami.

1257
01:30:44,590 --> 01:30:46,491
[SPEAKER_09]: This isn't the first time they put out wrestling games.

1258
01:30:46,591 --> 01:30:47,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no, they had Rumble Roses.

1259
01:30:48,751 --> 01:30:49,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember Rumble Roses?

1260
01:30:50,532 --> 01:30:51,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't that like your favorite Xbox game?

1261
01:30:52,072 --> 01:30:53,353
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to play that actually.

1262
01:30:53,453 --> 01:30:55,974
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a game that Dan would never pick up, but I really wanted to play it.

1263
01:30:56,034 --> 01:30:57,614
[SPEAKER_09]: You probably get it now for like $3.

1264
01:30:57,874 --> 01:30:58,354
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure.

1265
01:30:59,315 --> 01:31:02,296
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I saw Dead or Alive Volleyball or whatever for like $10 the other day.

1266
01:31:02,316 --> 01:31:03,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, that was fun.

1267
01:31:04,758 --> 01:31:05,858
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a game to play when drunk.

1268
01:31:06,579 --> 01:31:07,179
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got it.

1269
01:31:08,059 --> 01:31:10,020
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, I've watched Dan play it while I was drunk.

1270
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:12,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Portal Drunk, instant throw up.

1271
01:31:12,781 --> 01:31:16,943
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100Matt on his Twitter account says, Not so much a story, but a question for Loki.

1272
01:31:17,323 --> 01:31:18,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you paying attention, Loki?

1273
01:31:18,203 --> 01:31:19,044
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm paying attention.

1274
01:31:19,084 --> 01:31:20,684
[SPEAKER_07]: He's playing the unicorn farting game.

1275
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:22,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, he just crashed the unicorn, so here we go.

1276
01:31:23,045 --> 01:31:27,367
[SPEAKER_09]: What's your opinion on the kid that was caught trying to steal the game Breach at PAX East?

1277
01:31:28,214 --> 01:31:31,056
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it was a good attempt, I guess, but he got caught.

1278
01:31:32,377 --> 01:31:33,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't compliment him.

1279
01:31:34,018 --> 01:31:35,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice try, kid.

1280
01:31:35,279 --> 01:31:36,820
[SPEAKER_09]: He doesn't deserve a compliment.

1281
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:39,662
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a stupid asshole thing to do.

1282
01:31:39,762 --> 01:31:41,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well, his reasons were retarded.

1283
01:31:41,323 --> 01:31:43,024
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, I just wanted to play this with my friend.

1284
01:31:43,865 --> 01:31:48,208
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, no, you wanted to brag that you had the game is what you wanted to do.

1285
01:31:49,088 --> 01:31:54,212
[SPEAKER_10]: And unfortunately, you're stupid and you got caught, so now you're going to face fines and jail time and all that stuff.

1286
01:31:54,272 --> 01:31:54,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1287
01:31:55,232 --> 01:31:55,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Hope it was worth it.

1288
01:31:56,093 --> 01:31:59,014
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to say he probably shouldn't have done it in the first place.

1289
01:31:59,635 --> 01:32:01,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Just taking a lucky stab in the dark.

1290
01:32:02,236 --> 01:32:03,537
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, he shouldn't have, but you know.

1291
01:32:03,557 --> 01:32:06,038
[SPEAKER_10]: He wanted to make a name for himself.

1292
01:32:06,058 --> 01:32:08,059
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of surprising that he had the balls to do it.

1293
01:32:08,699 --> 01:32:10,420
[SPEAKER_09]: And then not show up to his court date.

1294
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:11,061
[SPEAKER_09]: That was pretty fun.

1295
01:32:12,582 --> 01:32:13,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Hilarious.

1296
01:32:13,682 --> 01:32:14,983
[SPEAKER_09]: He was too busy playing on Chat Roulette.

1297
01:32:15,823 --> 01:32:17,184
[SPEAKER_10]: He was playing Modern Warfare 2.

1298
01:32:18,045 --> 01:32:18,525
[SPEAKER_10]: Was he really?

1299
01:32:18,685 --> 01:32:18,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1300
01:32:21,334 --> 01:32:21,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Samurai Shodown 2

1301
01:32:40,536 --> 01:32:41,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Samurai Shodown 2

1302
01:33:01,090 --> 01:33:08,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft says DJ Hero's price is now down to $50 at Toys R Us and links us to a new story about the price reduction.

1303
01:33:08,492 --> 01:33:11,253
[SPEAKER_10]: That didn't move as well as they thought it would.

1304
01:33:11,553 --> 01:33:13,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Now would be a good time to pick that up for DJ Hero 2.

1305
01:33:13,874 --> 01:33:14,334
[SPEAKER_09]: Just saying.

1306
01:33:14,634 --> 01:33:17,215
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to get the controller and have it for DJ Hero 2.

1307
01:33:17,375 --> 01:33:24,317
[SPEAKER_10]: And they also have, if you really want to spend the money, they have these new bundles now that have two DJ Hero controllers with the game.

1308
01:33:25,259 --> 01:33:26,060
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a good game.

1309
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:29,362
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a bummer they didn't support the download content better because they could have done better.

1310
01:33:30,182 --> 01:33:31,403
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll pick up the sequel.

1311
01:33:31,423 --> 01:33:32,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't get me wrong.

1312
01:33:32,904 --> 01:33:33,645
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an awesome game.

1313
01:33:33,685 --> 01:33:40,710
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just typical, I guess, of Activision and their support for the download content.

1314
01:33:41,010 --> 01:33:46,853
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if you've seen what they do for the Guitar Hero series, it's not a big surprise that we only have, like, three pieces of download content.

1315
01:33:47,433 --> 01:33:50,214
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkTetsuya says, I just realized we haven't heard from the ferret in a while.

1316
01:33:50,234 --> 01:33:50,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever happened to him?

1317
01:33:51,355 --> 01:33:54,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, when we moved the show to Studio DarkSakura, the ferret didn't really come with us.

1318
01:33:55,076 --> 01:33:58,798
[SPEAKER_09]: I found it while moving, so the ferret is at my place right now, but...

1319
01:33:59,258 --> 01:34:00,359
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you next time.

1320
01:34:27,523 --> 01:34:28,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Ferret was, oh god, my ears.

1321
01:34:29,104 --> 01:34:29,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Ferret was better.

1322
01:34:30,185 --> 01:34:30,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1323
01:34:32,046 --> 01:34:32,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Ferret or Dalek?

1324
01:34:32,927 --> 01:34:33,467
[SPEAKER_09]: I say Ferret.

1325
01:34:34,088 --> 01:34:38,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, Ray Iannami says, or no, I'm sorry, I skipped one.

1326
01:34:38,891 --> 01:34:41,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Spazinator also sent, usually I don't do two tweets, but I will allow it tonight.

1327
01:34:41,874 --> 01:34:45,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Spazinator PSN says, Rob, you asked about a month ago if I seen the tester.

1328
01:34:45,476 --> 01:34:46,157
[SPEAKER_09]: Finally seen it.

1329
01:34:46,217 --> 01:34:47,258
[SPEAKER_09]: I have similar thoughts on it.

1330
01:34:47,578 --> 01:34:48,699
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I stopped watching it.

1331
01:34:49,339 --> 01:34:54,924
[SPEAKER_09]: I heard it ended finally and I'm pretty sure Season 1 ended Oh god, are they doing another one?

1332
01:34:55,145 --> 01:35:03,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, wow Well, anyhow, I'm pretty sure the person I thought was going to win won You know, I would go on season 2 of The Tester Why not?

1333
01:35:04,613 --> 01:35:15,423
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they probably tape it over a weekend and you get $5,000 for winning I mean, I probably wouldn't keep the job but I'd like to have the $5,000 I'd quit it I'd be a fame whore, why not?

1334
01:35:17,349 --> 01:35:18,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Now that you've won the tester, what do you think?

1335
01:35:19,711 --> 01:35:19,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Go Xbox.

1336
01:35:20,151 --> 01:35:20,471
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1337
01:35:20,491 --> 01:35:20,831
[SPEAKER_09]: I quit.

1338
01:35:21,312 --> 01:35:21,552
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1339
01:35:23,293 --> 01:35:24,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Might be fun for the experience.

1340
01:35:24,194 --> 01:35:24,554
[SPEAKER_09]: This game sucks.

1341
01:35:24,594 --> 01:35:26,275
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to play iPad.

1342
01:35:27,216 --> 01:35:27,476
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1343
01:35:27,776 --> 01:35:30,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Ray Iannami says, oh, whoops, that was a personal tweet here.

1344
01:35:30,938 --> 01:35:33,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Just it had at OLR in it here.

1345
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:36,902
[SPEAKER_09]: ShadowSniper says, your thoughts on Hitman 5 and what you would like to see in the new game?

1346
01:35:37,502 --> 01:35:38,103
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a Hitman 5?

1347
01:35:38,423 --> 01:35:40,444
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't even know there was a Hitman 5 coming out.

1348
01:35:41,605 --> 01:35:42,806
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't play Hitman 1 through 4.

1349
01:35:43,066 --> 01:35:44,106
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not really my type of game.

1350
01:35:44,166 --> 01:35:45,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, that's more of your alley.

1351
01:35:45,807 --> 01:35:50,249
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's a stealth action game, so that's not really my forte.

1352
01:35:50,329 --> 01:35:51,530
[SPEAKER_09]: What would I like to see in the new game?

1353
01:35:51,590 --> 01:35:52,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of sex and violence.

1354
01:35:52,951 --> 01:35:54,531
[SPEAKER_09]: That always makes for a great video game, right?

1355
01:35:54,912 --> 01:35:57,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Not Timothy Orban, whatever his name is.

1356
01:35:57,373 --> 01:35:58,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, and more lesbians.

1357
01:35:59,834 --> 01:36:08,678
[SPEAKER_09]: TigerClaw305 tweets us, GTA is being shown to school children to teach them about violence and links us to this news story here from VG247.com.

1358
01:36:10,479 --> 01:36:10,559
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1359
01:36:10,579 --> 01:36:12,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I had to check to make sure this wasn't dated April 1st.

1360
01:36:34,338 --> 01:36:34,638
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1361
01:36:34,658 --> 01:36:38,361
[SPEAKER_06]: They fight and fight and fight and fight and fight.

1362
01:36:38,381 --> 01:36:38,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Fight, fight, fight.

1363
01:36:38,961 --> 01:36:39,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Fight, fight, fight.

1364
01:36:39,842 --> 01:36:44,385
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a guess, but I don't think you show people violence to get them not desensitized to violence.

1365
01:36:44,845 --> 01:36:48,748
[SPEAKER_10]: That kind of is the opposite of what you want to do.

1366
01:36:48,768 --> 01:36:58,995
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what they did when I was young to scare the shit out of me, and this wasn't necessarily about violence, but it was violent, when they would teach us the responsibility of having a driver's license is they'd show us red asphalt.

1367
01:36:59,575 --> 01:37:01,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we laughed through that.

1368
01:37:01,776 --> 01:37:03,037
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not supposed to laugh.

1369
01:37:03,077 --> 01:37:03,978
[SPEAKER_09]: It's disgusting.

1370
01:37:05,719 --> 01:37:07,400
[SPEAKER_09]: I would not watch it.

1371
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:09,961
[SPEAKER_09]: I just would kind of look away and not really watch it.

1372
01:37:09,981 --> 01:37:11,622
[SPEAKER_09]: It was disgusting.

1373
01:37:11,642 --> 01:37:14,644
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember that every 15 minutes they teach you about drunk driving?

1374
01:37:14,664 --> 01:37:16,665
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, you're wasting so much time.

1375
01:37:16,825 --> 01:37:17,746
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care.

1376
01:37:18,166 --> 01:37:18,647
[SPEAKER_10]: I get it.

1377
01:37:18,907 --> 01:37:20,468
[SPEAKER_10]: This person had alcohol.

1378
01:37:20,788 --> 01:37:24,130
[SPEAKER_10]: They got in a fictional drunk driving accident.

1379
01:37:24,290 --> 01:37:24,990
[SPEAKER_10]: It's sad.

1380
01:37:25,170 --> 01:37:25,871
[SPEAKER_10]: It happens.

1381
01:37:26,271 --> 01:37:28,913
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do I have to sit here for two hours while you talk about it?

1382
01:37:29,393 --> 01:37:30,273
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't do that at my school.

1383
01:37:30,293 --> 01:37:31,154
[SPEAKER_10]: Did they actually drink?

1384
01:37:31,874 --> 01:37:32,334
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they didn't.

1385
01:37:32,755 --> 01:37:33,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's what they did.

1386
01:37:33,355 --> 01:37:34,295
[SPEAKER_09]: This is great.

1387
01:37:35,336 --> 01:37:37,877
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is from how I understand that they did it.

1388
01:37:38,037 --> 01:37:39,417
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be a little different.

1389
01:37:39,698 --> 01:37:45,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, first they came out on our football field because we had our stadium and whatever.

1390
01:37:45,320 --> 01:37:50,362
[SPEAKER_10]: They had everybody sit there and they had this big thing covered up with a tarp or something.

1391
01:37:50,742 --> 01:37:54,124
[SPEAKER_10]: So they pulled the tarp off and it's this horrible car accident.

1392
01:37:54,664 --> 01:37:56,665
[SPEAKER_10]: Like this person mangled or whatever.

1393
01:37:56,685 --> 01:37:58,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, it's just a person with makeup on and whatnot.

1394
01:37:59,786 --> 01:38:04,810
[SPEAKER_10]: And then an ambulance comes and they realistically pull them out of the wreckage and stuff like that.

1395
01:38:05,950 --> 01:38:09,953
[SPEAKER_10]: And then later on... Was it like one of the students?

1396
01:38:10,033 --> 01:38:12,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it was one of the students.

1397
01:38:12,355 --> 01:38:13,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Or it was somebody.

1398
01:38:13,956 --> 01:38:17,959
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, and then later on they have this grim reaper walking around the entire day.

1399
01:38:18,379 --> 01:38:21,901
[SPEAKER_10]: And every 15 minutes they would take a student and pull them out of class.

1400
01:38:22,041 --> 01:38:23,682
[SPEAKER_10]: And they were basically dead.

1401
01:38:23,922 --> 01:38:25,784
[SPEAKER_10]: And they wouldn't be there for the rest of the week.

1402
01:38:26,044 --> 01:38:27,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Or however long it was.

1403
01:38:27,385 --> 01:38:28,766
[SPEAKER_09]: You had to get out of school for a week?

1404
01:38:29,546 --> 01:38:32,868
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, but, you know, it's like punishment, basically.

1405
01:38:34,169 --> 01:38:37,011
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't know if... Wait, punishment?

1406
01:38:37,271 --> 01:38:37,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, no, hold on.

1407
01:38:37,892 --> 01:38:39,873
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you do to get the Grim Reaper to tap you?

1408
01:38:40,233 --> 01:38:42,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Matt didn't do his homework, you come with me, kid.

1409
01:38:43,395 --> 01:38:50,580
[SPEAKER_10]: No, so here's what really happened from what I hear, and I don't know if this is entirely accurate because it's really fucked up if it is.

1410
01:38:52,001 --> 01:38:58,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, they took him to some sort of location, a cabin or whatever, and made him write notes to their parents or something like that.

1411
01:38:59,506 --> 01:39:01,868
[SPEAKER_10]: Dear Mom, I am dead

1412
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:18,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi Mom, I died at school today.

1413
01:39:18,221 --> 01:39:21,824
[SPEAKER_10]: The Grim Reaper took me out of class because I drank and drove.

1414
01:39:21,864 --> 01:39:24,866
[SPEAKER_10]: They wrote letters to their parents later on about stuff like that.

1415
01:39:25,206 --> 01:39:34,773
[SPEAKER_10]: But apparently the impression I was under is that the police went to their house and told their parents that they were dead.

1416
01:39:35,934 --> 01:39:39,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Should they be out trying to catch real drunk drivers?

1417
01:39:40,818 --> 01:39:42,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, you know what they did at my school?

1418
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:44,841
[SPEAKER_09]: They would have the really mean, fugly P.E.

1419
01:39:44,861 --> 01:39:56,491
[SPEAKER_09]: teacher come in and say, they would say, if you drink and drive, you're going to go to jail, and you're going to stay there forever, and you're going to have a criminal record, and if you drink and drive, you're an idiot.

1420
01:39:56,571 --> 01:39:57,572
[SPEAKER_09]: It took five minutes.

1421
01:39:57,672 --> 01:40:00,094
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, yeah, okay, I understand that, and that makes perfect sense.

1422
01:40:00,194 --> 01:40:03,457
[SPEAKER_10]: So not only do we have to sit through this two-hour long, you know,

1423
01:40:06,032 --> 01:40:10,895
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't do it because you'll get two assemblies that you'll have to sit through

1424
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:41,965
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but honestly though, I mean, duh, drinking and driving impairs you and you can die, okay, or kill somebody.

1425
01:40:42,426 --> 01:40:47,450
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, any sane person that has some sort of common sense gets that.

1426
01:40:47,910 --> 01:40:56,718
[SPEAKER_10]: However, nowadays kids are not being raised with common sense, so it's no wonder that they have to have multiple assemblies in order for this to sink in.

1427
01:40:56,778 --> 01:40:58,739
[SPEAKER_10]: And even then, it's just not going to.

1428
01:40:58,759 --> 01:40:58,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1429
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:00,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's okay.

1430
01:41:00,100 --> 01:41:02,001
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to smoke pot instead.

1431
01:41:02,742 --> 01:41:03,462
[SPEAKER_10]: That's better.

1432
01:41:04,723 --> 01:41:06,564
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not drinking and driving at all.

1433
01:41:07,364 --> 01:41:08,205
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck you, Grim Reaper.

1434
01:41:10,806 --> 01:41:11,947
[SPEAKER_10]: What were we talking about before?

1435
01:41:12,087 --> 01:41:12,767
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember.

1436
01:41:14,728 --> 01:41:21,592
[SPEAKER_09]: I was trying to see if they had that clip that I remember from the 90s that was... Yeah, I think it's this.

1437
01:41:22,893 --> 01:41:24,774
[SPEAKER_09]: This was very much like what they did at my school.

1438
01:41:24,794 --> 01:41:25,454
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's this clip.

1439
01:41:25,973 --> 01:41:28,114
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Beavis and Butthead.

1440
01:41:29,114 --> 01:41:32,736
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand Mr. McVicar has made a little arrangement with you guys.

1441
01:41:32,856 --> 01:41:34,276
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a little probation.

1442
01:41:35,137 --> 01:41:40,319
[SPEAKER_00]: You see, class, Beavis and Butthead here are not allowed to laugh for a whole week.

1443
01:41:41,283 --> 01:41:50,414
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, and if they do laugh, they'll be expelled, and they'll have to go to Hope High School where they'll get their asses kicked on a daily basis by all the other delinquents.

1444
01:41:50,494 --> 01:41:51,455
[SPEAKER_00]: Ha ha ha!

1445
01:41:51,855 --> 01:41:53,998
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was real glad to hear that, because this is Sex Education Week.

1446
01:41:54,018 --> 01:41:54,799
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, Sex Ed Week!

1447
01:42:01,104 --> 01:42:02,926
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be talking about the penis!

1448
01:42:03,986 --> 01:42:06,048
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be talking about the vagina!

1449
01:42:06,669 --> 01:42:08,450
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that's funny, butthead?

1450
01:42:08,730 --> 01:42:12,113
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find it amusing that we'll be talking about the testicles?

1451
01:42:13,194 --> 01:42:24,824
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we're also going to be talking about venereal disease, sexual intercourse, and we will definitely be spending a lot of time talking about masturbation!

1452
01:42:28,303 --> 01:42:29,364
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what they did in my school.

1453
01:42:29,624 --> 01:42:30,885
[SPEAKER_00]: See, this is great.

1454
01:42:31,225 --> 01:42:35,728
[SPEAKER_10]: See, this is the type of letter, actually, that they had the right for the every 15 minutes program.

1455
01:42:35,768 --> 01:42:40,211
[SPEAKER_10]: Dear Mom and Dad, every 15 minutes, someone dies as a result of an alcohol-related collision.

1456
01:42:40,451 --> 01:42:43,873
[SPEAKER_10]: Today, I died and I never got the chance to tell you, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1457
01:42:45,194 --> 01:42:46,315
[SPEAKER_10]: and that's what made them all upset.

1458
01:42:46,475 --> 01:42:47,196
[SPEAKER_10]: It was annoying.

1459
01:42:47,496 --> 01:42:47,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Trust me.

1460
01:42:48,216 --> 01:42:51,739
[SPEAKER_09]: If you go through high school, at least... Just get the gym teacher in there for five minutes.

1461
01:42:51,799 --> 01:42:52,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Scare the hell out of everyone.

1462
01:42:53,660 --> 01:42:55,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to see me again?

1463
01:42:55,362 --> 01:42:56,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to see me again?

1464
01:42:57,883 --> 01:42:59,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, we have some other tweets.

1465
01:43:00,485 --> 01:43:05,089
[SPEAKER_09]: MNZiba follows that with a question about Pokemon RO.

1466
01:43:08,188 --> 01:43:11,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Plugging the old Pokemon RO telling us that you can actually win a beta account.

1467
01:43:11,950 --> 01:43:13,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently they're doing a test, a little thing there.

1468
01:43:13,690 --> 01:43:15,731
[SPEAKER_09]: But the thing they linked us to didn't work.

1469
01:43:16,132 --> 01:43:16,892
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's my thing.

1470
01:43:17,332 --> 01:43:18,653
[SPEAKER_09]: For some reason the link didn't work.

1471
01:43:18,693 --> 01:43:20,213
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's my question about Pokemon RO.

1472
01:43:20,854 --> 01:43:23,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't one of these Pokemon operations get shut down recently?

1473
01:43:23,355 --> 01:43:24,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Like there was a Pokemon MMO going on?

1474
01:43:24,955 --> 01:43:25,175
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1475
01:43:25,215 --> 01:43:28,077
[SPEAKER_09]: Like isn't this kind of a dangerous thing to be running right now in light of that?

1476
01:43:28,097 --> 01:43:28,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Possibly.

1477
01:43:28,437 --> 01:43:28,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I'm just saying.

1478
01:43:29,037 --> 01:43:30,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I hope it doesn't get shut down.

1479
01:43:30,698 --> 01:43:32,439
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't like to see that happen to this.

1480
01:43:32,519 --> 01:43:35,340
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm just saying if Nintendo did the other one, just...

1481
01:43:35,620 --> 01:43:36,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Be careful, kids.

1482
01:43:37,002 --> 01:43:41,828
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen some of the in-game stuff that looks pretty Ragnarok-y, pretty good.

1483
01:43:42,182 --> 01:43:42,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1484
01:43:43,722 --> 01:43:43,983
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1485
01:43:44,363 --> 01:43:45,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, that's it for Twitter topics tonight.

1486
01:43:45,883 --> 01:43:47,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys so much for the tweets.

1487
01:43:47,063 --> 01:43:48,184
[SPEAKER_09]: And sorry I didn't get to everything.

1488
01:43:48,204 --> 01:43:50,624
[SPEAKER_09]: But, well, we had to play the clip from Beavis and Butthead.

1489
01:43:50,845 --> 01:43:54,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us in the future.

1490
01:43:54,786 --> 01:43:55,026
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1491
01:43:55,486 --> 01:44:01,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Giovedea in our chat room says, I took a college class where we had to yell tits, ass, penis, vagina, and all that on the first day of class.

1492
01:44:02,828 --> 01:44:04,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Sex education in college is actually a lot of fun.

1493
01:44:04,809 --> 01:44:05,649
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's educational.

1494
01:44:06,536 --> 01:44:07,557
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1495
01:44:33,114 --> 01:44:47,335
[SPEAKER_09]: so they had a transsexual come in teacher shut the door and said okay for the next hour you can ask anything you want and this person has agreed to answer any gross curiosity, whatever you've ever wanted to know now it's time to ask it so they asked everything everything

1496
01:44:48,208 --> 01:44:50,148
[SPEAKER_09]: But it was a highly educational day, I'll tell you that.

1497
01:44:50,849 --> 01:44:52,709
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's going to be that forthcoming.

1498
01:44:52,789 --> 01:44:57,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Our sixth grade sex ed was hilarious because we had a female teacher.

1499
01:44:58,050 --> 01:45:00,931
[SPEAKER_10]: So the female teacher took the girls and explained the girls stuff.

1500
01:45:01,311 --> 01:45:08,412
[SPEAKER_10]: And then apparently some kid's father was the person we had teaching the male portion of it.

1501
01:45:08,512 --> 01:45:09,753
[SPEAKER_10]: And the guy was a pervert.

1502
01:45:11,193 --> 01:45:11,953
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was funny.

1503
01:45:12,830 --> 01:45:20,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they used to split up the class for us too, but I just... And then the teacher found out the guy was a pervert, and that was the end of sex ed.

1504
01:45:22,134 --> 01:45:26,336
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys might find this funny, but when I was in sex ed, you know what test I did?

1505
01:45:26,937 --> 01:45:28,738
[SPEAKER_09]: We had six different tests throughout class.

1506
01:45:28,758 --> 01:45:32,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know which test I got the lowest score on out of all the tests that they gave out in class?

1507
01:45:32,839 --> 01:45:33,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Male anatomy?

1508
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:33,880
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1509
01:45:34,540 --> 01:45:35,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Vagina week.

1510
01:45:35,481 --> 01:45:36,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Vagina week?

1511
01:45:38,652 --> 01:45:39,374
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd find that funny.

1512
01:45:39,935 --> 01:45:40,918
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought y'all would get a kick out of that.

1513
01:45:40,938 --> 01:45:42,401
[SPEAKER_06]: I find that ironic.

1514
01:45:44,113 --> 01:45:46,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, gaming news, once in a while.

1515
01:45:48,716 --> 01:45:49,997
[SPEAKER_09]: It happens, believe it or not.

1516
01:45:50,037 --> 01:45:52,198
[SPEAKER_09]: We talk about video game news on this program.

1517
01:45:52,999 --> 01:45:55,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, God, what happened to this show, Loki?

1518
01:45:56,862 --> 01:46:03,606
[SPEAKER_10]: So, what's kind of neat is there's a rumor that Microsoft's live support is coming to the free games that you get with Windows.

1519
01:46:03,966 --> 01:46:09,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, you may remember all those wonderful classics as Solitaire, Minesweeper, Chess, etc.

1520
01:46:10,391 --> 01:46:13,272
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of these I have never heard of, I guess because I don't have Windows 7, like,

1521
01:46:14,413 --> 01:46:15,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Purple Place?

1522
01:46:15,294 --> 01:46:17,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Purple Place, yeah, it's one of the new Windows 7 games.

1523
01:46:19,356 --> 01:46:20,877
[SPEAKER_09]: And Windows has Mahjong now?

1524
01:46:21,217 --> 01:46:23,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

1525
01:46:23,439 --> 01:46:24,079
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on Vista.

1526
01:46:25,220 --> 01:46:26,320
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I haven't used Vista yet.

1527
01:46:26,340 --> 01:46:26,901
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on Vista and 7.

1528
01:46:27,121 --> 01:46:30,743
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically the old Shanghai game, but now Microsoft brand.

1529
01:46:31,283 --> 01:46:38,788
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, I wonder if that means, yeah, apparently they're going to not only get achievements, but chat and leaderboard support.

1530
01:46:40,901 --> 01:47:02,602
[SPEAKER_09]: So now I can chat with people while playing Solitaire and have leaderboards Interesting that they're going to integrate this Solitaire is a huge game on Windows It's probably the number one Windows game above anything else you can think of WoW, Halo, anything you can think of Solitaire is probably a bigger game then

1531
01:47:04,161 --> 01:47:05,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Should have been working now.

1532
01:47:05,742 --> 01:47:06,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Achievement.

1533
01:47:28,018 --> 01:47:29,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Played solitaire between the hours of 8 a.m.

1534
01:47:29,959 --> 01:47:30,600
[SPEAKER_09]: and 5 p.m.

1535
01:47:30,640 --> 01:47:31,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Achievement unlocked.

1536
01:47:34,702 --> 01:47:40,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, Microsoft, of course, isn't the only one that has a gaming network that is continuing to grow and develop.

1537
01:47:40,425 --> 01:47:43,167
[SPEAKER_09]: But another big company is launching their own game network.

1538
01:47:43,227 --> 01:47:43,867
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Apple.

1539
01:47:43,947 --> 01:47:44,347
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

1540
01:47:44,748 --> 01:47:50,311
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the big things that was announced as part of the new iPhone 4.0 OS is Game Center.

1541
01:47:51,231 --> 01:48:05,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Game Center is going to be a single online gaming experience for the Apple devices that will kind of link all these games together you'll be able to invite and track friends you'll have matchmaking with this leaderboards and achievements that's right it's very own achievements

1542
01:48:07,860 --> 01:48:31,378
[SPEAKER_09]: What's kind of interesting about this is that systems like this already exist somewhat in Apple's world I don't know if any of you guys grabbed the Commodore 64 emulator that's available on the Apple It was free a couple days ago, I think just for like last weekend, so I grabbed it It uses a technology called OpenFaint, which I believe is by the people who made AuroraFaint Which was one of the very early, early iPhone games that was out there

1543
01:48:31,718 --> 01:48:43,604
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the same type of thing Somebody to develop this platform Well, what happened is that now you have OpenFaint And you have these other competing platforms as well And so Apple has finally just decided to step in and say You know what?

1544
01:48:43,784 --> 01:48:59,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I think we're going to do our own thing Not just to steal a good idea But I think to kind of They probably see what's happening with the developers And that more and more game developers want to be on OpenFaint or something like this So Apple probably just wants to standardize it across the board

1545
01:48:59,771 --> 01:49:03,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it affects their branding, I think.

1546
01:49:04,714 --> 01:49:09,457
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and as much as you want to kind of say, well, they're big and evil for wanting to basically shut down OpenFaint.

1547
01:49:09,477 --> 01:49:16,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they're not really shutting down OpenFaint, but they're really trying to render it irrelevant, although I'm sure OpenFaint will still be around for some things.

1548
01:49:17,841 --> 01:49:20,083
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Apple is very big on consistency.

1549
01:49:20,717 --> 01:49:24,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Hence why they have such a rigid review thing for apps.

1550
01:49:24,978 --> 01:49:28,419
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a reason why your apps all kind of look and feel the same.

1551
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:32,661
[SPEAKER_09]: It's because it's not like you get to make whatever buttons you want.

1552
01:49:32,941 --> 01:49:34,921
[SPEAKER_09]: There are limitations to what you get to do with apps.

1553
01:49:35,742 --> 01:49:37,522
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's to give consistency.

1554
01:49:38,122 --> 01:49:43,304
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think Apple wants to take kind of reign of this to bring that same consistency because it works well for them.

1555
01:49:44,963 --> 01:49:51,154
[SPEAKER_09]: But of course, there's always that controversy because they don't really publish a lot of those guidelines and what exactly they look for when they screen things.

1556
01:49:52,799 --> 01:49:56,461
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, some other things that were announced that will affect gamers on the iPhone.

1557
01:49:56,481 --> 01:50:01,804
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, obviously there's multitasking was the big thing, although I got a 3G, so I'm screwed on that one.

1558
01:50:01,844 --> 01:50:02,624
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to get that.

1559
01:50:02,964 --> 01:50:06,486
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully they announce a new iPhone in June because I'm eligible for an upgrade in October.

1560
01:50:06,706 --> 01:50:07,607
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really want to just upgrade.

1561
01:50:07,627 --> 01:50:08,847
[SPEAKER_06]: But it works for the 3GS.

1562
01:50:08,948 --> 01:50:11,709
[SPEAKER_09]: It will work for the 3GS, but I know Apple.

1563
01:50:11,909 --> 01:50:15,211
[SPEAKER_09]: There will be another newer, nicer iPhone within the year.

1564
01:50:15,811 --> 01:50:17,292
[SPEAKER_09]: So I got to hold out for that.

1565
01:50:17,492 --> 01:50:19,514
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got that in common with Nintendo, don't they?

1566
01:50:21,355 --> 01:50:22,856
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah.

1567
01:50:22,956 --> 01:50:26,479
[SPEAKER_09]: I really, really, really want to get an iPad because I'm a big fucking sheep.

1568
01:50:27,219 --> 01:50:27,920
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm going to wait.

1569
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:33,144
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to wait until next year because I just know that camera on the front will be on next year's iPad.

1570
01:50:33,264 --> 01:50:41,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Dan and I were actually talking about how we both want one, but we're specifically going to wait until another generation goes by.

1571
01:50:43,551 --> 01:50:46,774
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we're probably going to get them.

1572
01:50:47,941 --> 01:50:52,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, by the way, just so you know, not just the multitasking, voice over IP in the background.

1573
01:50:52,144 --> 01:50:54,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you can have Skype running and get calls on Skype.

1574
01:50:54,265 --> 01:50:54,886
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty neat.

1575
01:50:55,446 --> 01:50:57,247
[SPEAKER_09]: And, again, no, not on 3G.

1576
01:50:57,828 --> 01:51:01,951
[SPEAKER_09]: And folders to organize your stuff better, which is actually really helpful.

1577
01:51:02,151 --> 01:51:06,013
[SPEAKER_07]: See, I think a lot of what they're incorporating, though, is stuff that they've actually stolen from the jailbreakers.

1578
01:51:06,874 --> 01:51:08,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm not surprised.

1579
01:51:08,355 --> 01:51:17,181
[SPEAKER_07]: My friend's got a jailbroken iPhone, and it's got folders and all kinds of stuff with it, and he can use it as a storage device, and it's kind of crazy.

1580
01:51:17,201 --> 01:51:17,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1581
01:51:17,928 --> 01:51:18,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and what was the other one?

1582
01:51:18,849 --> 01:51:19,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, ads.

1583
01:51:19,710 --> 01:51:20,431
[SPEAKER_09]: The iAds.

1584
01:51:20,511 --> 01:51:24,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Now they're gonna have, uh, Apple's gonna have its own ad platform because I guess they just didn't like AdMob.

1585
01:51:25,678 --> 01:51:27,640
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they wanted, it's not they didn't like it, they wanted a piece of it.

1586
01:51:28,261 --> 01:51:29,062
[SPEAKER_09]: But no Flash!

1587
01:51:30,543 --> 01:51:31,384
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very interesting.

1588
01:51:31,404 --> 01:51:39,369
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to get too techy on you guys, but it's very interesting how Apple is kind of kicking down Adobe and they're also kicking down Google.

1589
01:51:39,389 --> 01:51:51,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you know that they are taking out... I mean, you still will be able to search on the new iPhone 4.0 OS and you can use Google as a search engine, but the button will not say... It says Google right now.

1590
01:51:51,376 --> 01:51:52,297
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't say anything else.

1591
01:51:52,797 --> 01:51:56,039
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're opening it up for you to use Bing, Yahoo, whatever.

1592
01:51:57,940 --> 01:51:58,801
[SPEAKER_06]: This one's pretty cool.

1593
01:52:00,017 --> 01:52:04,140
[SPEAKER_09]: I do like the stuff that's coming with the 4.0 OS.

1594
01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:08,742
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a little bummed that it won't work on my phone, but at the same time, I'm getting a little irritated with my phone.

1595
01:52:08,762 --> 01:52:09,463
[SPEAKER_09]: It locks up.

1596
01:52:09,523 --> 01:52:10,063
[SPEAKER_09]: It's slow.

1597
01:52:10,864 --> 01:52:11,244
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1598
01:52:11,304 --> 01:52:13,965
[SPEAKER_09]: I might need to wipe it and reinstall everything.

1599
01:52:14,005 --> 01:52:16,207
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what the hell is making it run so crappy.

1600
01:52:16,607 --> 01:52:18,368
[SPEAKER_09]: But yet, here I am, still a sheep.

1601
01:52:18,468 --> 01:52:21,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Could it be the Apple-created CPU inside of it?

1602
01:52:23,237 --> 01:52:29,982
[SPEAKER_09]: I might have all these problems, but at the end of the day, dang, I'll tell you, I use my iPhone so freaking much.

1603
01:52:30,882 --> 01:52:33,324
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a great little device to have in my pocket, I will say that.

1604
01:52:34,605 --> 01:52:35,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, let's move on.

1605
01:52:36,066 --> 01:52:38,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Something non-Apple related, DarkSakura.

1606
01:52:38,407 --> 01:52:42,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there are some pretty big Final Fantasy fans out and about.

1607
01:52:42,950 --> 01:52:46,212
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's one person who's doing a very interesting translation of it.

1608
01:52:46,713 --> 01:52:49,214
[SPEAKER_07]: They are doing Final Fantasy in Latin.

1609
01:52:49,895 --> 01:52:50,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Latin.

1610
01:52:51,693 --> 01:52:53,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1611
01:52:54,455 --> 01:52:58,818
[SPEAKER_07]: It's of course going to be a ROM with Patch, but it's in Latin.

1612
01:53:00,419 --> 01:53:00,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1613
01:53:00,739 --> 01:53:01,280
[SPEAKER_10]: That's hardcore.

1614
01:53:03,661 --> 01:53:08,304
[SPEAKER_07]: It just makes me think of Eddie as they're talking about being mugged and saying something to them in Latin.

1615
01:53:08,605 --> 01:53:09,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no, he knows Latin!

1616
01:53:09,705 --> 01:53:09,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Run!

1617
01:53:12,028 --> 01:53:21,806
[SPEAKER_07]: But I like the little line that, excuse me, I must be allergic to Latin, that Destructoid has in their little article about it.

1618
01:53:21,826 --> 01:53:24,271
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, now can I get a copy of Alundra and Esperanto?

1619
01:53:25,879 --> 01:53:26,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

1620
01:53:27,960 --> 01:53:30,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't Esperanto like a completely made up language?

1621
01:53:30,061 --> 01:53:33,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's not something that is like... It was meant to be a universal language.

1622
01:53:33,662 --> 01:53:35,863
[SPEAKER_07]: So it takes elements from different... I see.

1623
01:53:36,403 --> 01:53:38,744
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually it's... I'll tell you what, Rob.

1624
01:53:38,904 --> 01:53:43,306
[SPEAKER_07]: You can look right now at a page in Esperanto and get an idea of what they're talking about.

1625
01:53:43,546 --> 01:53:43,826
[SPEAKER_09]: I see.

1626
01:53:44,206 --> 01:53:45,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it derives a little bit from every language.

1627
01:53:46,267 --> 01:53:46,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1628
01:53:46,767 --> 01:53:47,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's kind of neat.

1629
01:53:47,907 --> 01:53:50,048
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know people who are learning it, so... That's cool.

1630
01:53:50,368 --> 01:53:51,309
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds cool.

1631
01:53:52,129 --> 01:53:53,410
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a friend that spoke it, actually.

1632
01:53:53,570 --> 01:53:54,510
[SPEAKER_09]: It was interesting to hear.

1633
01:53:56,297 --> 01:53:58,458
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to call her an Esperanto.

1634
01:53:59,698 --> 01:54:01,759
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not because I have to talk to the call.

1635
01:54:01,979 --> 01:54:04,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, if somebody calls an Esperanto, you're talking to them.

1636
01:54:05,620 --> 01:54:09,001
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll say, uh, si, si, no.

1637
01:54:10,221 --> 01:54:14,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, Loki, something in English, please.

1638
01:54:15,334 --> 01:54:19,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Fear 3 has been announced coming from Warner Brothers.

1639
01:54:20,478 --> 01:54:31,809
[SPEAKER_10]: And what's kind of neat about the new franchise in this horror shooter game is actually it's going to be including cinematics created by John Carpenter.

1640
01:54:32,409 --> 01:54:32,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1641
01:54:52,605 --> 01:54:57,027
[SPEAKER_10]: So, pretty good pedigree there, and I know the franchise has been pretty good.

1642
01:54:57,387 --> 01:55:08,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Hell, Fear 2 had some pretty awesome multiplayer in it, especially with all the maps with the Toy Soldier maps, and the theme song for that trailer, which I still can't get out of my head.

1643
01:55:11,374 --> 01:55:14,515
[SPEAKER_10]: Looking forward to it, and no time frame yet when it's been announced.

1644
01:55:14,535 --> 01:55:20,318
[SPEAKER_10]: It's supposed to be scheduled to be coming out in the fall, probably around November or so, on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

1645
01:55:24,195 --> 01:55:26,477
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the game you probably pick up?

1646
01:55:26,577 --> 01:55:27,697
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't played the other ones.

1647
01:55:28,438 --> 01:55:33,621
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been kind of curious to check it out, especially number two, but maybe I'll check it out.

1648
01:55:33,701 --> 01:55:34,022
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1649
01:55:35,243 --> 01:55:38,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, more information coming out on Red Dead Redemption.

1650
01:55:38,765 --> 01:55:40,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, this game was also shown off at PAX East.

1651
01:55:40,866 --> 01:55:42,728
[SPEAKER_09]: That was probably one of those other games that Loki would have liked to see.

1652
01:55:42,848 --> 01:55:43,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yes.

1653
01:55:43,748 --> 01:55:48,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they announced, though, this week that multiplayer free roam is going to be a feature in Red Dead Redemption.

1654
01:55:48,932 --> 01:55:50,613
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that's also in Grand Theft Auto 4, correct?

1655
01:55:51,774 --> 01:55:53,095
[SPEAKER_10]: It's something similar.

1656
01:55:53,415 --> 01:56:04,883
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds very similar to free mode in Grand Theft Auto 4, but this one's almost... I would say it's closer to, like, party mode in Grand Theft Auto 4, where you can kind of join in.

1657
01:56:05,043 --> 01:56:06,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me describe it a little bit here.

1658
01:56:06,084 --> 01:56:10,266
[SPEAKER_09]: You can explore the full single-player game world, but you'll be in a multiplayer environment.

1659
01:56:10,286 --> 01:56:10,987
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds kind of like the...

1660
01:56:12,808 --> 01:56:13,309
[SPEAKER_09]: on Xbox.

1661
01:56:13,329 --> 01:56:14,190
[SPEAKER_09]: She's kind of like that too.

1662
01:56:14,931 --> 01:56:17,114
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's separate from the single player story mode.

1663
01:56:17,214 --> 01:56:25,026
[SPEAKER_09]: So in free roam, you can either go in by yourself or you band together with friends together in eight and then you can take on other little bands.

1664
01:56:25,146 --> 01:56:28,651
[SPEAKER_09]: You can either hunt down criminals together or just, you know, shoot the shit out of each other.

1665
01:56:29,611 --> 01:56:52,959
[SPEAKER_10]: 16 players in the same lobby at once yeah and you get experience points as you do these different multiplayer modes 50 levels of character progressions the new xp will unlock new weapons mounts characters and challenges yeah it sounds very similar to the party mode in Grand Theft Auto 4 because you can basically jump into um it's it's like a lobby but it's basically just a portion of the Grand Theft Auto map and if you really want to you can just

1666
01:56:53,599 --> 01:56:57,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Hang around in the lobby and drive all over the entire map or do whatever.

1667
01:56:58,043 --> 01:57:02,546
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is going to be very similar to that where you can kind of play more of a freeform version of the game.

1668
01:57:02,826 --> 01:57:14,075
[SPEAKER_10]: Plus they have areas where it will launch different things like deathmatch modes or hunting or, you know, I believe there's like a capture the gold type mode in there.

1669
01:57:14,175 --> 01:57:15,356
[SPEAKER_10]: So it'll be very cool.

1670
01:57:16,376 --> 01:57:16,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1671
01:57:17,277 --> 01:57:19,859
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm looking to try to mod this game to put a car into it.

1672
01:57:20,520 --> 01:57:30,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Just because I know the engine that they're using is probably extremely similar to Grand Theft Auto and if it's anything like that game was set up, it should be very easy to do something similar like that.

1673
01:57:31,368 --> 01:57:32,709
[SPEAKER_10]: You and your freaking hacks.

1674
01:57:33,109 --> 01:57:35,711
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be hilarious for rocket launchers or something.

1675
01:57:36,892 --> 01:57:37,172
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1676
01:57:37,973 --> 01:57:43,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let's get to the segment of the show that doesn't involve cars or bringing things into places they shouldn't be.

1677
01:57:44,398 --> 01:57:45,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Except spam.

1678
01:57:45,099 --> 01:57:48,562
[SPEAKER_09]: We do get a lot of spam that shouldn't be in the mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

1679
01:57:48,582 --> 01:57:53,786
[SPEAKER_09]: That's mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com is our email address for you to send your emails to every week.

1680
01:57:53,866 --> 01:57:56,048
[SPEAKER_09]: We read our favorites here on the show and respond to them.

1681
01:57:56,809 --> 01:58:01,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Dark Sakura likes to dive into the mailbag and pull out some of her favorites and read them right now.

1682
01:58:01,313 --> 01:58:04,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you would like to participate sometime.

1683
01:58:05,543 --> 01:58:08,004
[SPEAKER_07]: DSMaster26 sent an email.

1684
01:58:09,405 --> 01:58:10,766
[SPEAKER_09]: Try not to sound too excited about it.

1685
01:58:11,226 --> 01:58:18,149
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very badly written and it's giving me a headache, so I think I might just translate it into real English.

1686
01:58:18,169 --> 01:58:19,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, go for it.

1687
01:58:20,891 --> 01:58:20,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1688
01:58:21,967 --> 01:58:23,348
[SPEAKER_09]: I could try and read it the way it's written.

1689
01:58:24,129 --> 01:58:24,750
[SPEAKER_07]: I could do it.

1690
01:58:25,110 --> 01:58:25,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1691
01:58:26,071 --> 01:58:39,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, as it's written, Dear C4 and OLR crew, I am giving a giant F you to is Microsoft because of them raping me in the ass for 15 minutes.

1692
01:58:39,943 --> 01:58:41,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I can't take it anymore.

1693
01:58:41,144 --> 01:58:41,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Translate, please.

1694
01:58:42,245 --> 01:58:42,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1695
01:58:43,586 --> 01:58:48,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Um... Dear Olarkra, I'm giving a giant F you to Microsoft because they're raping me in the ass for 50 bucks a year.

1696
01:58:48,149 --> 01:58:49,009
[SPEAKER_07]: That is crap.

1697
01:58:49,389 --> 01:58:51,691
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm regretting getting a 360.

1698
01:58:51,851 --> 01:58:55,133
[SPEAKER_07]: I should have bought... It's spelled B-O-U, not B-A-U.

1699
01:58:55,433 --> 01:58:56,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Bought the PS3.

1700
01:58:58,054 --> 01:58:59,975
[SPEAKER_07]: At least you should have instead of should of.

1701
01:59:00,115 --> 01:59:00,675
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate that.

1702
01:59:01,215 --> 01:59:04,335
[SPEAKER_07]: It is should have, would have, could have.

1703
01:59:04,436 --> 01:59:06,616
[SPEAKER_07]: So he doesn't get an F. Just a D minus.

1704
01:59:06,636 --> 01:59:07,256
[SPEAKER_07]: He gets a D minus.

1705
01:59:08,296 --> 01:59:10,277
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you for at least avoiding one of my pet peeves.

1706
01:59:11,837 --> 01:59:13,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Here are the reasons why... Okay.

1707
01:59:16,638 --> 01:59:17,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Cry.

1708
01:59:18,499 --> 01:59:19,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Web browser.

1709
01:59:20,059 --> 01:59:24,500
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's regions, R-E-G-I-O-N, not R-E-G-I-N.

1710
01:59:25,340 --> 01:59:42,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, Locking, New Beat Mania, 2DX17, Free Online Play, No Cost, Netflix Without Paying for PSN, and finally, that's all wrong, and finally, 5, um, Bluetooth, okay, god, this sucks.

1711
01:59:44,569 --> 01:59:47,550
[SPEAKER_00]: Punctuation, do you speak it?

1712
01:59:48,030 --> 01:59:48,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1713
01:59:51,059 --> 01:59:59,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Many phones have Bluetooth, therefore, therefore ends in an E, by the way, I can use the headset for both my phone and PS3.

1714
02:00:01,427 --> 02:00:07,451
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm wondering if you have any suggestions for Bimani titles for PS3 and 360.

1715
02:00:08,752 --> 02:00:14,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Please help, I'm on a Bimani binge ever since I played 2DX17 at the arcade in Omaha.

1716
02:00:14,353 --> 02:00:14,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Help.

1717
02:00:14,794 --> 02:00:16,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Peace out, DSMaster26.

1718
02:00:16,294 --> 02:00:19,815
[SPEAKER_09]: There's really not a lot available on the 360 and PS3.

1719
02:00:20,115 --> 02:00:22,776
[SPEAKER_09]: I will tell you, no way in hell should you spend any money on Beat and Groovy.

1720
02:00:23,536 --> 02:00:25,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, I like DJ Hero a lot.

1721
02:00:25,316 --> 02:00:31,298
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that's not Bimani, technically, but as far as music game goes, it's really the best with Rock Band.

1722
02:00:32,679 --> 02:00:36,561
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're looking for DDR and stuff, there's just not a lot of great stuff.

1723
02:00:36,581 --> 02:00:42,085
[SPEAKER_09]: You can go for Dance Dance Revolution Universe, and I would say Universe 2 is probably the best of the series.

1724
02:00:43,666 --> 02:00:48,069
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get Universe 3 very easily, though, but it's on the auto games or whatever.

1725
02:00:48,089 --> 02:00:51,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Karaoke Revolution, if you like that kind of stuff.

1726
02:00:51,811 --> 02:00:52,792
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1727
02:00:53,152 --> 02:00:53,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Not my favorite.

1728
02:00:53,693 --> 02:01:01,258
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you really want the True Bomani experience that they've brought to you straight to the next-gen system, then Rock Revolution is definitely a title for you.

1729
02:01:03,320 --> 02:01:06,483
[SPEAKER_10]: That'll basically tell you what they think of the new systems.

1730
02:01:06,803 --> 02:01:07,805
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a PS on here.

1731
02:01:09,226 --> 02:01:09,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1732
02:01:09,887 --> 02:01:12,930
[SPEAKER_07]: I challenge Mel B to a perfect attack and freestyle DDR match.

1733
02:01:13,050 --> 02:01:13,771
[SPEAKER_07]: He will go down.

1734
02:01:14,151 --> 02:01:14,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Not bloody likely.

1735
02:01:16,814 --> 02:01:18,316
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you perfect attack and freestyle?

1736
02:01:19,002 --> 02:01:20,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect Attack, Freestyle

1737
02:01:36,341 --> 02:01:37,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, you know, I haven't asked him.

1738
02:01:38,183 --> 02:01:40,986
[SPEAKER_09]: I think he listens to this show, though, so maybe he can email us and tell us.

1739
02:01:41,046 --> 02:01:47,612
[SPEAKER_09]: I think he still kind of follows it, but I don't think he really... Well, yeah, he does a lot of DJing gigs and stuff.

1740
02:01:47,712 --> 02:01:50,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Not DJ Hero, but real, actual DJing.

1741
02:01:51,115 --> 02:01:52,737
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that's a big hobby of his now.

1742
02:01:54,158 --> 02:01:55,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Where are they now?

1743
02:01:55,560 --> 02:01:57,561
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be a fun segment to do on OLR someday.

1744
02:01:57,622 --> 02:01:58,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Where are they now?

1745
02:01:58,422 --> 02:01:59,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Where is Jahi?

1746
02:02:02,379 --> 02:02:02,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, good question.

1747
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:04,761
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't heard from Jahi in a long time.

1748
02:02:04,781 --> 02:02:05,201
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1749
02:02:05,221 --> 02:02:06,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we need to do this.

1750
02:02:06,302 --> 02:02:07,542
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like an OLR special.

1751
02:02:07,562 --> 02:02:08,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe for our anniversary.

1752
02:02:08,643 --> 02:02:12,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, find Bomani people from back in the day and do like a Where Are They Now segment.

1753
02:02:13,226 --> 02:02:16,708
[SPEAKER_09]: But like, a lot of our newer listeners wouldn't understand.

1754
02:02:17,069 --> 02:02:17,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Who cares?

1755
02:02:17,709 --> 02:02:19,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I broke out the orange bat, Rob.

1756
02:02:19,910 --> 02:02:20,651
[SPEAKER_07]: I broke out the orange bat.

1757
02:02:20,671 --> 02:02:21,672
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you did.

1758
02:02:21,732 --> 02:02:23,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, Wendell.

1759
02:02:23,733 --> 02:02:24,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my God.

1760
02:02:24,413 --> 02:02:25,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you seen Wendell lately?

1761
02:02:25,574 --> 02:02:26,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-uh.

1762
02:02:26,895 --> 02:02:27,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

1763
02:02:27,115 --> 02:02:27,976
[SPEAKER_09]: I heard he lost a lot of weight.

1764
02:02:27,996 --> 02:02:28,996
[SPEAKER_07]: He's looking pretty good.

1765
02:02:30,097 --> 02:02:30,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Step Squad RTF Reunion

1766
02:02:48,334 --> 02:03:17,468
[SPEAKER_09]: well something like that we wouldn't necessarily have to do it here like we could find a place to remote broadcast we'd go to Sweet Tomatoes where could we I don't know we'll have to find a big space that used to be where we'd all meet up to go to dinner like years and years ago we'd go to Sweet Tomatoes and Concord let's figure something out we're gonna do that for our next anniversary show I bet number nine I should go on DDR Freak and post something NorCal famous DDR players wanted for a reunion special or something like that that'd be fun

1767
02:03:18,399 --> 02:03:20,112
[SPEAKER_07]: I keep a lot more on my Facebook.

1768
02:03:20,714 --> 02:03:22,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm, I just, where can we do it?

1769
02:03:22,095 --> 02:03:25,157
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there's too many people to have here, and I don't have a big garage anymore.

1770
02:03:25,337 --> 02:03:26,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Dave and Busters!

1771
02:03:28,078 --> 02:03:29,339
[SPEAKER_09]: We could do a roadshow.

1772
02:03:29,459 --> 02:03:30,700
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm set up to do that because of PAX.

1773
02:03:30,720 --> 02:03:34,202
[SPEAKER_07]: We could do a roadshow, and on top of that, I think I'll have my... We just couldn't do that live.

1774
02:03:34,282 --> 02:03:40,325
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I, actually, au contraire, I may have my Wi-Fi tether on my phone working.

1775
02:03:41,086 --> 02:03:41,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh.

1776
02:03:41,286 --> 02:03:43,387
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a Wi-Fi tether for the 3GS.

1777
02:03:43,427 --> 02:03:45,929
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be tough to do 96K to all games.

1778
02:03:45,949 --> 02:03:47,710
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be tough on a Wi-Fi tether.

1779
02:03:48,670 --> 02:03:48,950
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1780
02:03:50,272 --> 02:03:53,294
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet if anybody knows how to do it, Scott probably does because I think he's done it before.

1781
02:03:53,415 --> 02:03:54,736
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll talk to him about it.

1782
02:03:55,757 --> 02:03:56,237
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

1783
02:03:57,979 --> 02:03:58,219
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1784
02:03:59,649 --> 02:04:06,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, now, I got... I had received the first email that you sent me before, but I've just been so wiped out and busy.

1785
02:04:06,851 --> 02:04:17,294
[SPEAKER_07]: But the man that I met at the Atari party, Sal, he sent an email, and he sent me some stuff that I want to... Was that the music guy?

1786
02:04:17,534 --> 02:04:19,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I totally want to interview him.

1787
02:04:19,335 --> 02:04:27,457
[SPEAKER_07]: As soon as... If I was not flat broke, I would be... I want to order one of the systems that he's got, because he's doing games for the...

1788
02:04:29,638 --> 02:04:31,860
[SPEAKER_07]: and Atari 800 XL.

1789
02:04:33,341 --> 02:04:34,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Working on OutRun.

1790
02:04:34,842 --> 02:04:38,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Has a version of Space Harrier that's actually really sweet.

1791
02:04:38,584 --> 02:04:39,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Complete with voice, by the way.

1792
02:04:40,745 --> 02:04:41,886
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very impressed.

1793
02:04:42,907 --> 02:04:44,808
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll go ahead and actually give them a plug.

1794
02:04:45,068 --> 02:04:52,092
[SPEAKER_07]: It's KJ Mann's Atari Sales and Electronics.

1795
02:04:52,112 --> 02:04:52,813
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll find them on eBay.

1796
02:04:52,853 --> 02:04:54,614
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just K-J-M-A-N-N-S-H.

1797
02:04:55,094 --> 02:04:55,955
[SPEAKER_07]: He's really cool.

1798
02:04:56,455 --> 02:05:01,539
[SPEAKER_07]: And the stuff, the ports that he's worked with are just amazing.

1799
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:02,280
[SPEAKER_07]: They're amazing.

1800
02:05:03,861 --> 02:05:04,562
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very impressed.

1801
02:05:05,663 --> 02:05:06,644
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll try to get him on the show.

1802
02:05:06,684 --> 02:05:07,124
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be fun.

1803
02:05:07,324 --> 02:05:07,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1804
02:05:08,085 --> 02:05:10,547
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get him to come to this OLRCon we're suddenly planning.

1805
02:05:11,528 --> 02:05:12,228
[SPEAKER_07]: OLRCon!

1806
02:05:12,889 --> 02:05:15,691
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder how much it costs to rent, like, a big hall somewhere.

1807
02:05:15,911 --> 02:05:17,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we should call it OLRCon.

1808
02:05:17,192 --> 02:05:18,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Just do OLRCon.

1809
02:05:18,413 --> 02:05:18,934
[SPEAKER_09]: For real.

1810
02:05:19,034 --> 02:05:21,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, just fucking do it already.

1811
02:05:21,876 --> 02:05:24,038
[SPEAKER_07]: My brain just suddenly made OLRCon Asylum.

1812
02:05:26,252 --> 02:05:26,592
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1813
02:05:26,632 --> 02:05:27,513
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have to think about it.

1814
02:05:27,773 --> 02:05:32,176
[SPEAKER_09]: How could we do OLRCon and not have it fail miserably where we're going to spend a lot of money on it?

1815
02:05:32,236 --> 02:05:32,536
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1816
02:05:32,556 --> 02:05:33,256
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to think about this.

1817
02:05:34,217 --> 02:05:36,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so I think it's King of Rush.

1818
02:05:37,199 --> 02:05:38,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1819
02:05:38,760 --> 02:05:42,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Said, why was Rob's mom pwning all of us with that last phrase?

1820
02:05:43,483 --> 02:05:45,284
[SPEAKER_09]: That must have been texted or something during the show.

1821
02:05:46,445 --> 02:05:47,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Because she's my mother.

1822
02:05:47,365 --> 02:05:48,526
[SPEAKER_09]: It's where I get my sense of humor from.

1823
02:05:49,986 --> 02:06:03,324
[SPEAKER_07]: And Don't You Dare Talk Trash About Her Dude, Rob's mom is such a nice lady She's fun So, I got one from Robaba That's an Orange Lounge Radio Wordle

1824
02:06:05,106 --> 02:06:08,327
[SPEAKER_07]: And, dude, I love, oh, I love anything that's typography.

1825
02:06:08,788 --> 02:06:09,408
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is so sweet.

1826
02:06:09,488 --> 02:06:10,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I saw that.

1827
02:06:10,188 --> 02:06:13,530
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like the art with all the common words from our website.

1828
02:06:13,950 --> 02:06:14,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1829
02:06:14,550 --> 02:06:16,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of like if it's used a lot, then it's big.

1830
02:06:16,171 --> 02:06:16,431
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's not.

1831
02:06:16,451 --> 02:06:16,991
[SPEAKER_06]: B for you.

1832
02:06:17,952 --> 02:06:24,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think B for you, at the time he did that, was like being highlighted as like the I love that song.

1833
02:06:24,955 --> 02:06:27,776
[SPEAKER_09]: You know that segment that Dark Tetsuya and Actdeft and some people do for our site?

1834
02:06:28,036 --> 02:06:28,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1835
02:06:28,396 --> 02:06:28,916
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that song.

1836
02:06:28,936 --> 02:06:32,278
[SPEAKER_09]: I think B for you was like the song that was up at the moment that that happened.

1837
02:06:32,611 --> 02:06:33,992
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm totally going to save the pictures.

1838
02:06:34,012 --> 02:06:44,436
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's generated in Flash, but I have this little fun tool to grab images off by doing just a plain old screenshot of it.

1839
02:06:44,876 --> 02:06:45,657
[SPEAKER_07]: You can crop them.

1840
02:06:45,797 --> 02:06:47,578
[SPEAKER_07]: I love this thing, and I'm trying to remember.

1841
02:06:47,618 --> 02:06:48,638
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's called Pixlr.

1842
02:06:49,218 --> 02:06:55,301
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a plug-in for whatever the crap this program is that I'm using.

1843
02:06:57,318 --> 02:06:59,360
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway.

1844
02:07:00,961 --> 02:07:02,342
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, it's really cool.

1845
02:07:02,382 --> 02:07:02,863
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it.

1846
02:07:04,784 --> 02:07:10,409
[SPEAKER_07]: And I like that he puts a comment that I suppose that word will filter out curse words.

1847
02:07:12,771 --> 02:07:14,352
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the last one is...

1848
02:07:18,371 --> 02:07:20,153
[SPEAKER_07]: from somebody who hasn't put a name on here.

1849
02:07:21,234 --> 02:07:25,559
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to say Brandon, because that's the closest thing I can find.

1850
02:07:26,320 --> 02:07:38,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Dear OLR, after listening to OLR Archive episode, I have started to have a money craze, so I spent my whole allowance, $30, on tokens, and I played some Beatmania 2DX, read, cranked...

1851
02:07:41,655 --> 02:07:47,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Crank211, Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, Parapara, DDR, Pop Music, and Keyboard Mania.

1852
02:07:48,077 --> 02:07:49,097
[SPEAKER_07]: It was epic fun.

1853
02:07:50,818 --> 02:07:55,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, we need to go to Art Vigil soon.

1854
02:07:56,099 --> 02:07:56,599
[SPEAKER_09]: We can go.

1855
02:07:56,619 --> 02:07:57,940
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's just down the street.

1856
02:07:58,140 --> 02:07:59,440
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, but I want to play.

1857
02:08:00,961 --> 02:08:02,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, I've got to dance.

1858
02:08:07,338 --> 02:08:07,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1859
02:08:08,740 --> 02:08:15,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, anyhow, let's move on to the part of the show where we get a little bit of angst off our chests.

1860
02:08:15,327 --> 02:08:18,170
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the FUs of the week, and they're going to start right now.

1861
02:08:34,208 --> 02:08:38,710
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to the big pile of carrot cake in my fridge.

1862
02:08:40,711 --> 02:08:43,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I have eaten almost nothing but carrot cake all day.

1863
02:08:44,212 --> 02:08:45,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Except when I came home and ate a rib.

1864
02:08:46,833 --> 02:08:47,874
[SPEAKER_07]: I ate a rib.

1865
02:08:49,114 --> 02:08:49,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and some chips.

1866
02:08:49,995 --> 02:08:50,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it a tasty rib?

1867
02:08:51,195 --> 02:08:52,576
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a very tasty rib.

1868
02:08:52,616 --> 02:08:53,316
[SPEAKER_07]: It was delicious.

1869
02:08:54,176 --> 02:08:56,657
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think he got kosher beef, too.

1870
02:08:56,837 --> 02:08:57,998
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, anyway, it was really good.

1871
02:08:58,918 --> 02:08:59,398
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway...

1872
02:09:02,372 --> 02:09:04,593
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't eat any more cake.

1873
02:09:04,753 --> 02:09:05,253
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't.

1874
02:09:05,814 --> 02:09:06,994
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that I can.

1875
02:09:07,675 --> 02:09:12,818
[SPEAKER_07]: And my tummy behaved very well yesterday despite all the beer that I drank.

1876
02:09:12,838 --> 02:09:14,719
[SPEAKER_07]: I think all the beer broke everything else down.

1877
02:09:15,159 --> 02:09:18,461
[SPEAKER_07]: But today I'm suffering for it, so... Fuck you, gluten!

1878
02:09:21,863 --> 02:09:22,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead, Loki.

1879
02:09:23,600 --> 02:09:28,061
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to the KFC special sauce that they put on the KFC Double Down.

1880
02:09:28,502 --> 02:09:40,765
[SPEAKER_10]: It really ruined the Double Down, and it's unfortunate because it had potential to be a great unhealthy piece of chicken that I could have eaten, but instead it was just all nasty sauce that I tasted.

1881
02:09:41,305 --> 02:09:46,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe next time I will have to do the pseudo-Windows 7 burger and get a 7x7 from...

1882
02:09:49,338 --> 02:09:51,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops, Holic came in early, my bad.

1883
02:09:51,819 --> 02:09:52,579
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say that.

1884
02:09:53,439 --> 02:09:55,119
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to Holic, playing early.

1885
02:09:55,760 --> 02:10:04,021
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, yeah, so I should do a Windows 7 pseudo-burger from In-N-Out 7x7.

1886
02:10:04,222 --> 02:10:07,422
[SPEAKER_10]: I've had a 4x4 before.

1887
02:10:07,442 --> 02:10:10,103
[SPEAKER_10]: They're really not as filling as you would think.

1888
02:10:12,432 --> 02:10:18,555
[SPEAKER_09]: My FU of the week goes to my confidence and self-esteem because I'm starting a new job tomorrow and I'm really nervous.

1889
02:10:18,795 --> 02:10:21,436
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be like so different for me.

1890
02:10:21,456 --> 02:10:22,197
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all going to laugh at you.

1891
02:10:22,217 --> 02:10:23,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they're all going to laugh at me.

1892
02:10:23,637 --> 02:10:24,898
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I know I'll do fine.

1893
02:10:24,918 --> 02:10:37,284
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's just – it's weird because like guys, seriously, the day job I've had – because, okay, it was funny because when I posted – I have listeners on my Facebook and when I posted to Facebook that I was leaving my old job, people were like, oh, you get to do OLR full time now?

1894
02:10:37,324 --> 02:10:38,205
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm like, ha!

1895
02:10:38,425 --> 02:10:40,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

1896
02:11:03,988 --> 02:11:10,955
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, on a serious note, I have a day job and the day job I've had, I've had for the past like seven years.

1897
02:11:11,216 --> 02:11:14,859
[SPEAKER_09]: So almost as long as OLR has been going on, which is a fucking long time, just so you know.

1898
02:11:15,820 --> 02:11:16,681
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm changing that.

1899
02:11:16,721 --> 02:11:22,067
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm doing a new job starting tomorrow and it's kind of nerve wracking, but I think it'll be good.

1900
02:11:22,735 --> 02:11:30,540
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm excited about what the new position is and obviously I don't like to talk a lot about my day job on the show because I don't want no presents showing up at my workplace.

1901
02:11:31,660 --> 02:11:32,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Or bombs.

1902
02:11:32,541 --> 02:11:32,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1903
02:11:33,821 --> 02:11:34,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Please no.

1904
02:11:34,522 --> 02:11:35,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Just no.

1905
02:11:36,203 --> 02:11:40,445
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyhow, yeah, I mean, I think it's great that people send gifts, but I don't know.

1906
02:11:40,465 --> 02:11:42,346
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just something weird about having my address out there.

1907
02:11:42,366 --> 02:11:44,127
[SPEAKER_09]: I just like to know who you are.

1908
02:11:44,547 --> 02:11:45,748
[SPEAKER_10]: It was also on my business card.

1909
02:11:46,348 --> 02:11:48,349
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, our Orange Lounge Radio business card.

1910
02:11:48,389 --> 02:11:49,250
[SPEAKER_10]: So you think one of our...

1911
02:11:49,890 --> 02:11:51,591
[SPEAKER_10]: If someone could have gotten it, I don't know.

1912
02:11:51,631 --> 02:11:51,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

1913
02:11:52,052 --> 02:11:52,332
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1914
02:11:52,372 --> 02:11:53,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, I'm over it.

1915
02:11:53,993 --> 02:11:54,273
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1916
02:11:54,313 --> 02:11:55,354
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it for the FU's of the week.

1917
02:11:55,454 --> 02:11:56,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Couple more news stories for you guys.

1918
02:11:56,855 --> 02:11:57,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Then the Skype line.

1919
02:11:58,156 --> 02:12:02,459
[SPEAKER_09]: And believe it or not, our phone works again.

1920
02:12:02,499 --> 02:12:03,619
[SPEAKER_09]: It was broken last week.

1921
02:12:03,739 --> 02:12:04,520
[SPEAKER_09]: It works again.

1922
02:12:04,540 --> 02:12:06,601
[SPEAKER_09]: 877-GAME-OLR works.

1923
02:12:07,202 --> 02:12:08,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, Orange Laundry on Skype.

1924
02:12:08,763 --> 02:12:09,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Both of them will work.

1925
02:12:09,723 --> 02:12:10,644
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're not taking calls yet.

1926
02:12:10,684 --> 02:12:11,545
[SPEAKER_09]: We still got two more stories.

1927
02:12:11,565 --> 02:12:11,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

1928
02:12:12,566 --> 02:12:12,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1929
02:12:13,907 --> 02:12:18,613
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's talk a little bit about how not to do collector's editions.

1930
02:12:19,033 --> 02:12:20,075
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

1931
02:12:20,676 --> 02:12:21,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Splinter Cell Conviction.

1932
02:12:21,877 --> 02:12:25,201
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a wonderful game coming out this coming week here.

1933
02:12:26,443 --> 02:12:30,628
[SPEAKER_10]: And apparently they're dropping $10 off the price of the collector's edition because...

1934
02:12:30,988 --> 02:12:35,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Guess what the USB drive that they included with it is faulty.

1935
02:12:36,130 --> 02:12:44,193
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently there's a possibility of faulty USB drives included with the game and so they're knocking $10 off of it to kind of compensate for that.

1936
02:12:45,013 --> 02:12:53,756
[SPEAKER_10]: And apparently none of the other content has been affected but the bonus content included on the USB drive may be inaccessible in some copies.

1937
02:12:56,448 --> 02:12:58,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Well that turned out to be a bummer for someone didn't it?

1938
02:12:58,789 --> 02:13:25,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah that is a bummer and let me tell you this much you know from a distributor reseller standpoint that's going to be a fucking bitch when I come in on Monday because we're going to have to deal with all these credits to people that we sold the game to because Ubisoft fucked up so thank you Ubisoft appreciate it and whoever manufactured those little USB cards are going to get taken to the cleaners

1939
02:13:26,718 --> 02:13:26,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1940
02:13:26,819 --> 02:13:26,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1941
02:13:30,911 --> 02:13:45,722
[SPEAKER_10]: and really the USB cards, what they have on them here, they've got a little artwork here, is a credit card size USB drive that had making of video, concept art, renders, screenshots, storyboards, and wallpapers.

1942
02:13:45,842 --> 02:13:46,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Who gives a shit?

1943
02:13:47,063 --> 02:13:50,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, can't you format that thing now and use it as storage on your 360?

1944
02:13:50,465 --> 02:13:53,227
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you cannot because I don't believe it is over a gig.

1945
02:13:53,327 --> 02:13:55,389
[SPEAKER_10]: You need at least a gig to be able to use it.

1946
02:13:55,569 --> 02:13:56,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1947
02:13:57,230 --> 02:14:00,472
[SPEAKER_09]: and you really want to have 16 gigs because you only get two cards, right?

1948
02:14:00,492 --> 02:14:01,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

1949
02:14:01,132 --> 02:14:01,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Seems so weird to me.

1950
02:14:02,833 --> 02:14:03,314
[SPEAKER_09]: So weird to me.

1951
02:14:03,714 --> 02:14:10,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's kind of a slow news week and we found this article as a popular destination on Dig and I thought, what the hell, we'll bring it up on the show.

1952
02:14:10,738 --> 02:14:16,382
[SPEAKER_09]: It's from IGN and it talks about the most anticipated Xbox Live arcade games that are coming up to the service.

1953
02:14:16,422 --> 02:14:16,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Just things...

1954
02:14:17,182 --> 02:14:17,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Sonic the Hedgehog 4

1955
02:14:43,860 --> 02:14:46,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Very anticipated Xbox Live game.

1956
02:14:46,581 --> 02:14:47,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Shank.

1957
02:14:48,381 --> 02:14:50,722
[SPEAKER_09]: That was being shown at PAX earlier this year.

1958
02:14:51,182 --> 02:14:52,622
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not Shaft, but Shank.

1959
02:14:53,262 --> 02:14:54,082
[SPEAKER_09]: And he has a steel blade.

1960
02:14:54,102 --> 02:14:54,562
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty awesome.

1961
02:14:54,782 --> 02:14:55,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's very bloody.

1962
02:14:55,983 --> 02:14:57,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks like your kind of game.

1963
02:14:57,523 --> 02:15:00,104
[SPEAKER_09]: Hydrophobia, which was also shown at PAX East.

1964
02:15:00,144 --> 02:15:02,424
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like kind of a Tomb Raider-ish type of game.

1965
02:15:03,644 --> 02:15:05,445
[SPEAKER_09]: But she's afraid of the water, so no swimming.

1966
02:15:05,605 --> 02:15:06,925
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes me think of Bioshock.

1967
02:15:08,226 --> 02:15:09,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Puzzle Quest 2.

1968
02:15:09,527 --> 02:15:09,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't care.

1969
02:15:10,708 --> 02:15:12,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, speak for yourself.

1970
02:15:12,469 --> 02:15:14,050
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I was speaking for myself.

1971
02:15:14,110 --> 02:15:14,670
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.

1972
02:15:15,130 --> 02:15:17,132
[SPEAKER_09]: I do care, so I'm excited about that.

1973
02:15:17,772 --> 02:15:19,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Might and Magic, Clash of Heroes.

1974
02:15:19,753 --> 02:15:19,994
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't care.

1975
02:15:20,014 --> 02:15:20,694
[SPEAKER_09]: That looks pretty good.

1976
02:15:21,535 --> 02:15:22,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it looks like it could be interesting.

1977
02:15:24,236 --> 02:15:26,198
[SPEAKER_09]: The art style looks really good.

1978
02:15:26,738 --> 02:15:27,999
[SPEAKER_09]: They have it on the DS.

1979
02:15:28,079 --> 02:15:28,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah?

1980
02:15:28,819 --> 02:15:28,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1981
02:15:30,380 --> 02:15:46,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Super Meat Boy I have a custom coffee mug that I painted Super Meat Boy on Elsa on the other side has Eduardo the Samurai Toaster That's my WiiWare coffee mug that I made

1982
02:15:46,576 --> 02:15:47,336
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm actually kidding.

1983
02:15:47,376 --> 02:15:49,137
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks interesting.

1984
02:15:49,718 --> 02:15:50,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Comic Jumper.

1985
02:15:50,798 --> 02:15:51,519
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know this one.

1986
02:15:51,539 --> 02:15:52,699
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds kind of fun.

1987
02:15:52,899 --> 02:15:54,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, the Maw and Explosion Man?

1988
02:15:55,160 --> 02:15:56,421
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good developer there.

1989
02:15:56,661 --> 02:15:57,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1990
02:15:57,782 --> 02:15:58,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Comedy Shooter.

1991
02:15:58,722 --> 02:16:00,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that supposed to be like Earthworm Jim or something?

1992
02:16:00,843 --> 02:16:01,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably.

1993
02:16:01,544 --> 02:16:01,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Similar.

1994
02:16:02,504 --> 02:16:04,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Monday Night Combat.

1995
02:16:04,625 --> 02:16:05,726
[SPEAKER_09]: That looks awesome.

1996
02:16:05,886 --> 02:16:07,727
[SPEAKER_09]: This one had a huge presence at PAX East.

1997
02:16:07,767 --> 02:16:10,928
[SPEAKER_09]: And they had an announcer guy out there on the show floor and everything.

1998
02:16:11,469 --> 02:16:14,410
[SPEAKER_09]: So it seems like all of these games were just PAX East games.

1999
02:16:16,311 --> 02:16:16,511
[SPEAKER_09]: So funny.

2000
02:16:31,906 --> 02:16:33,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, the phones are now open.

2001
02:16:33,787 --> 02:16:37,870
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2002
02:16:37,890 --> 02:16:42,312
[SPEAKER_09]: If you'd like to call to talk about, I don't know, anticipated Xbox Live arcade games or heck anything.

2003
02:16:42,672 --> 02:16:49,276
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, you know, we were out two weeks ago and then last week we had some troubles with the phones and we were only able to take a couple calls.

2004
02:16:49,717 --> 02:16:52,158
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm sure there will be plenty of people who want to get through tonight.

2005
02:16:52,218 --> 02:16:52,678
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's fine.

2006
02:16:52,698 --> 02:16:55,080
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a little extra time for calls.

2007
02:16:55,120 --> 02:16:58,702
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to do the show too late tonight, but we have some time for calls.

2008
02:16:59,202 --> 02:17:15,272
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, 877-GAME-OLR Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio It is now open and available for calls SHJ100Matt wants us to know He played MNC at PAX East And it was awesome Okay, phones are starting to ring Here we go Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio Who's this?

2009
02:17:16,192 --> 02:17:18,834
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Ranma, looks like I got through the first time once again.

2010
02:17:18,934 --> 02:17:22,998
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at you, you must have the least amount of lag or something.

2011
02:17:23,418 --> 02:17:23,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what's up?

2012
02:17:24,940 --> 02:17:26,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Not too much, man.

2013
02:17:26,401 --> 02:17:27,982
[SPEAKER_08]: A couple of things.

2014
02:17:28,102 --> 02:17:34,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, to reference back to earlier in the episode, they did port Twilight Scenic to the Nintendo DS.

2015
02:17:34,968 --> 02:17:36,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Came out about a couple of months ago.

2016
02:17:36,449 --> 02:17:36,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2017
02:17:37,190 --> 02:17:44,093
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm all for a Twilight game, provided it plays in a third-person shooter like Conker's Bad Fur Day, and I get to shoot them all up, then I'll buy that.

2018
02:18:02,509 --> 02:18:03,890
[SPEAKER_09]: I was trying to call in, but, um...

2019
02:18:32,873 --> 02:18:47,195
[SPEAKER_08]: on our podcast we covered this and my gaming girl who did some research on the article it seems that the company that did the game I think is Atomic Games they're backed by the CIA so I

2020
02:18:48,357 --> 02:19:14,498
[SPEAKER_09]: Kinda thinking that this was all like a little setup, like a publicity stunt Well now hold on, cause didn't they say that because of what you're saying That it actually made this theft of the code a lot worse than it would be otherwise Like this kid is almost like being investigated by the FBI at this point Like I don't know, I might be throwing in some extra stuff there But like it seemed like from what we were reporting last week Like what he did wasn't just bad, it was really bad

2021
02:19:16,345 --> 02:19:28,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty much, but if you're going to cross-reference that in, I'm just saying, because of how this came out, and I don't know about you, but if this was a big deal, don't you think everybody at PAX would have been hearing about this?

2022
02:19:31,170 --> 02:19:31,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they did.

2023
02:19:31,991 --> 02:19:33,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it just happened at a time we weren't around.

2024
02:19:33,811 --> 02:19:34,232
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2025
02:19:35,452 --> 02:19:36,793
[SPEAKER_09]: I certainly didn't hear anything like that.

2026
02:19:37,533 --> 02:19:40,874
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't either, but at the same time, I was kind of in and out of there.

2027
02:19:40,934 --> 02:19:42,375
[SPEAKER_09]: We left to eat.

2028
02:19:42,775 --> 02:19:46,356
[SPEAKER_09]: I came in late a lot of days just because of the time zone thing.

2029
02:19:46,396 --> 02:19:47,017
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't know.

2030
02:19:47,637 --> 02:19:52,159
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be a really weird publicity stunt type of thing.

2031
02:19:53,099 --> 02:19:55,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Weren't there court documents produced and everything, too?

2032
02:19:58,021 --> 02:19:59,002
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no idea.

2033
02:19:59,022 --> 02:20:00,443
[SPEAKER_08]: I have not heard anything about it.

2034
02:20:00,663 --> 02:20:02,284
[SPEAKER_08]: There's actually court documents.

2035
02:20:02,464 --> 02:20:05,965
[SPEAKER_08]: I will believe this guy actually did something stupid, you know?

2036
02:20:06,366 --> 02:20:09,147
[SPEAKER_08]: But if there are no court documents, I call shenanigans.

2037
02:20:09,267 --> 02:20:13,569
[SPEAKER_09]: I see where you're coming from, though, is that how could someone be so colossally stupid?

2038
02:20:13,629 --> 02:20:14,690
[SPEAKER_09]: It just seems so fake.

2039
02:20:16,431 --> 02:20:18,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Some people are that stupid, Ranma.

2040
02:20:18,372 --> 02:20:19,132
[SPEAKER_09]: It's sad but true.

2041
02:20:20,013 --> 02:20:20,273
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

2042
02:20:20,313 --> 02:20:21,874
[SPEAKER_08]: I used to work with people like that.

2043
02:20:22,574 --> 02:20:23,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty much.

2044
02:20:37,794 --> 02:20:38,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Very interesting.

2045
02:20:38,914 --> 02:20:40,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, anything else on your mind tonight, my friend?

2046
02:20:43,256 --> 02:20:44,196
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty much it.

2047
02:20:44,716 --> 02:20:45,036
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all.

2048
02:20:45,616 --> 02:20:48,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft in our chat wants to say, Matt posted the court files earlier.

2049
02:20:48,997 --> 02:20:51,958
[SPEAKER_09]: He's probably digging up the links again right now, so stay tuned to our chat room.

2050
02:20:51,978 --> 02:20:53,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'll definitely be following that.

2051
02:20:53,798 --> 02:20:54,078
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2052
02:20:54,619 --> 02:20:55,279
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, take care, buddy.

2053
02:20:55,899 --> 02:20:56,179
[SPEAKER_09]: You too.

2054
02:20:56,319 --> 02:20:56,859
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, bye-bye.

2055
02:20:58,160 --> 02:20:59,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go back to the phones.

2056
02:21:00,060 --> 02:21:00,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2057
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:01,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2058
02:21:03,441 --> 02:21:04,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, it's Ray Iannami.

2059
02:21:05,081 --> 02:21:06,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Ray Iannami.

2060
02:21:06,222 --> 02:21:06,842
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2061
02:21:08,934 --> 02:21:12,515
[SPEAKER_04]: I came out from SakuraCon last week, my first SakuraCon.

2062
02:21:13,335 --> 02:21:15,816
[SPEAKER_04]: You went all the way up to Seattle to go to SakuraCon?

2063
02:21:17,376 --> 02:21:18,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I went with some friends.

2064
02:21:20,157 --> 02:21:22,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't have, like, some friends up there, among other things.

2065
02:21:22,897 --> 02:21:24,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I don't know, you don't sound too happy.

2066
02:21:24,938 --> 02:21:26,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it a good time, or what happened?

2067
02:21:27,718 --> 02:21:28,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry, I'm just tired.

2068
02:21:28,638 --> 02:21:34,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, it's been a week, so... Anyway, SakuraCon's pretty cool, I guess.

2069
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:35,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

2070
02:21:36,775 --> 02:21:41,638
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to play quite a bit of games there like Tetris the Grandmaster 3 and some other crap.

2071
02:21:41,658 --> 02:21:44,559
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw him hosting the anime match game panel but

2072
02:22:03,306 --> 02:22:04,166
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that was my first time.

2073
02:22:04,186 --> 02:22:05,287
[SPEAKER_04]: I was surprised at how big it was.

2074
02:22:05,307 --> 02:22:08,768
[SPEAKER_04]: I could practically compare it to a shopping mall.

2075
02:22:08,908 --> 02:22:10,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially since part of it is like a shopping mall.

2076
02:22:25,129 --> 02:22:28,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's kind of integrated right into the downtown scene there, isn't it?

2077
02:22:28,612 --> 02:22:30,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, tell us a little more about the gaming they had there.

2078
02:22:30,413 --> 02:22:31,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Did they have, like, a big room?

2079
02:22:31,695 --> 02:22:32,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Were they doing tournaments?

2080
02:22:32,655 --> 02:22:33,716
[SPEAKER_09]: What was kind of going on with gaming?

2081
02:22:34,617 --> 02:22:37,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they had an arcade, but it wasn't too big.

2082
02:22:37,299 --> 02:22:41,182
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, like, mostly DDR, Indie Groove.

2083
02:22:41,823 --> 02:22:44,765
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a Pumped Up Pro 2 location test.

2084
02:22:45,846 --> 02:22:51,871
[SPEAKER_04]: They had Initial D4, Guitar for Kings, Run Mania, and Patrick's Teach, M3, and myself already.

2085
02:22:52,772 --> 02:22:53,973
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have played Pumped Up...

2086
02:22:54,304 --> 02:23:05,553
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wearing costumes that involved dress shoes, and dress shoes and arrows popping games don't seem like a good idea.

2087
02:23:05,573 --> 02:23:17,563
[SPEAKER_04]: I was cosplaying as Shell from Poppin' Music, the librarian guy, and Apollo Justice.

2088
02:23:18,664 --> 02:23:20,045
[SPEAKER_04]: I was cosplaying as one character.

2089
02:23:21,228 --> 02:23:24,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Cosmos is one character from Touhou, but I didn't have my costume prepared.

2090
02:23:25,651 --> 02:23:33,496
[SPEAKER_04]: And sticking to the Touhou panel, there was one thing that I didn't like about it, and that was them trying to demonstrate the Touhou games.

2091
02:23:33,996 --> 02:23:45,084
[SPEAKER_04]: They tried to demonstrate it by showing one of the game's later stages on lunatic difficulty, which is basically a difficulty level of a part, and as a small fan, it kind of pissed me off.

2092
02:23:45,804 --> 02:23:48,526
[SPEAKER_09]: Because maybe they made the game look way harder than it really is?

2093
02:23:49,955 --> 02:23:50,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, pretty much.

2094
02:23:50,875 --> 02:23:57,037
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm pretty sure a lot of the people who weren't really into Danmaku games were just confused what the hell was going on.

2095
02:23:57,917 --> 02:24:09,260
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if I was running, if I was, if I had a partner running the panel, I would have, like, alongside the Infamous stuff, I would also show, like, demonstration using easier stages and difficulty.

2096
02:24:09,280 --> 02:24:15,322
[SPEAKER_04]: So now, like, something that requires effort to get through, but, like, it's still pretty watchable.

2097
02:24:16,102 --> 02:24:18,503
[SPEAKER_04]: That way, people who are new to the series...

2098
02:24:19,147 --> 02:24:26,933
[SPEAKER_04]: can have a grasp of what it's like to play the games instead of just being, oh, wow, pretty bullet, too bad I can't dodge any of that shit.

2099
02:24:29,135 --> 02:24:36,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's... I gotta say, though, a lot of those shmups are so hard to me, but, you know, it takes talent.

2100
02:24:36,201 --> 02:24:37,582
[SPEAKER_09]: To be good at them, though, takes talent.

2101
02:24:38,483 --> 02:24:39,003
[SPEAKER_09]: That's for sure.

2102
02:24:40,184 --> 02:24:47,010
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, whenever I try to show people games, I don't go straight to, like, Horizon if it's a fighting game or

2103
02:24:47,754 --> 02:24:49,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Showing them level 43 songs on Poppin'.

2104
02:24:50,156 --> 02:24:53,818
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to show them easier stuff, something they can actually understand.

2105
02:24:54,159 --> 02:25:08,489
[SPEAKER_04]: A few months ago, I was at an arcade with a friend of mine, and she went through to Poppin', so I demonstrated Poppin' to her using easier songs, even if it meant songs that I didn't find to be as fun as songs I usually play.

2106
02:25:08,905 --> 02:25:09,666
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2107
02:25:33,661 --> 02:25:56,398
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the really low-end songs And that kind of goes with video games in general Like, if you don't want to scare someone off Like, you know they wouldn't like a shooter game Don't show them Halo or Gears of War Show them a video game that might be more their tastes You know, like, whether that be something like 1 versus 100 You know, might be a really good enabler for people to see that there's more to video games than that Or, you know, something on the Wii, I don't know

2108
02:25:57,519 --> 02:25:58,179
[SPEAKER_09]: It is interesting.

2109
02:25:58,219 --> 02:26:04,084
[SPEAKER_09]: I think sometimes people really scare people off from video games without realizing it because they go right for the hard stuff.

2110
02:26:04,724 --> 02:26:06,306
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of people do get intimidated.

2111
02:26:07,827 --> 02:26:22,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there are IRC channels and forums I hang out at where people are not too good at video games, so I kind of get how they feel about not being able to get past the first season for some up on, even on easy difficulty.

2112
02:26:22,579 --> 02:26:24,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

2113
02:26:25,211 --> 02:26:30,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, we gotta let you go so we can get some more calls, but, so, SakuraCon, do you think you'd try to go back next year?

2114
02:26:33,539 --> 02:26:40,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Possibly if my spring break is around SakuraCon again, because that would be one big deciding factor in me going.

2115
02:26:40,685 --> 02:26:43,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Last year it didn't line up with my spring break, so I didn't go.

2116
02:26:44,148 --> 02:26:46,170
[SPEAKER_09]: So if the timing's right, it just might be in the cards.

2117
02:26:46,590 --> 02:26:49,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, we gotta let you go to get more calls, but take care, Ray, okay?

2118
02:26:51,035 --> 02:27:09,241
[SPEAKER_09]: You too Alright, later Alright, I'll take a couple more calls here 877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio Take a few more calls here before we call it a night at OLR Studios Some last minute stories tonight we'll have in just a moment But first, another call Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

2119
02:27:10,762 --> 02:27:17,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, yeah, this is Spazinator Hey, Spazinator, you're cutting in and out a little bit But we'll try to move ahead What's on your mind, buddy?

2120
02:27:18,736 --> 02:27:24,580
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about that, I'm on the cell phone and unfortunately some stuff in my building interferes with the signal.

2121
02:27:25,040 --> 02:27:25,580
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.

2122
02:27:25,640 --> 02:27:33,865
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, I tried calling in last week to give you an update as to my PlayStation 3 situation.

2123
02:27:34,085 --> 02:27:35,766
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, it's been a little while since we heard about that.

2124
02:27:35,806 --> 02:27:37,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we had our phone issues last week.

2125
02:27:37,267 --> 02:27:38,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what's the latest and greatest?

2126
02:27:38,688 --> 02:27:42,410
[SPEAKER_01]: To make this short and sweet...

2127
02:27:43,838 --> 02:28:06,956
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll probably gloss over the details, but the general points are that I got my PS3 back on the 30th, and a few days later they started putting my videos back onto my download queue, because the video store works differently than the game side of the store.

2128
02:28:07,791 --> 02:28:17,878
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, it took a while for everything to show up because they had to do everything manually and reauthorize everything.

2129
02:28:17,978 --> 02:28:27,085
[SPEAKER_01]: I get like over 700 videos, but needless to say, I got all my videos back, so I don't have to worry about that now.

2130
02:28:27,965 --> 02:28:29,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, 700 videos.

2131
02:28:29,506 --> 02:28:30,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh.

2132
02:28:30,387 --> 02:28:30,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2133
02:28:32,008 --> 02:28:34,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, not all those videos are paid for.

2134
02:28:34,970 --> 02:28:35,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those are...

2135
02:28:37,344 --> 02:28:45,452
[SPEAKER_01]: No, like the freebies they gave out is like promotions to get you to buy the rest of the series, you know, whatever that series may be.

2136
02:28:46,132 --> 02:29:00,826
[SPEAKER_01]: But needless to say, I got my reels back, and hopefully nothing goes wrong with the reel service in the future, but I'll just have to keep my fingers crossed on that, so...

2137
02:29:02,345 --> 02:29:04,107
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm sorry, Jamie.

2138
02:29:26,704 --> 02:29:27,924
[SPEAKER_09]: This time around, not to the same extent.

2139
02:29:27,944 --> 02:29:29,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I did keep what you and DarkSakura talked about.

2140
02:29:55,891 --> 02:29:56,791
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching.

2141
02:30:15,523 --> 02:30:31,458
[SPEAKER_01]: But in subsequent calls, speaking to other reps, just prior to me sending the machine in, they said, yeah, once you send the machine in and they send it back to me, they'll go through everything and reauthorize everything to download.

2142
02:30:32,876 --> 02:30:46,265
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I just have to interject here because as someone who has worked very closely with call centers in their day job, to me, that's a huge issue that you called in two times and got two different answers.

2143
02:30:46,825 --> 02:30:52,329
[SPEAKER_09]: And for anybody, you know, Sony's a big company and who knows, we might have somebody at Sony who happens to listen to this program.

2144
02:30:52,809 --> 02:30:53,930
[SPEAKER_09]: To me, that's a big issue.

2145
02:30:54,090 --> 02:30:57,152
[SPEAKER_09]: You should not call a call center, speak to two different people and get two different answers.

2146
02:30:57,486 --> 02:30:58,848
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree with that.

2147
02:30:58,868 --> 02:31:11,145
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually did customer service for a very long time and I did... Well, at the time the department was called Service Quality where we... If they had a question, they could call us and ask us and we would tell them and make sure you repeat this.

2148
02:31:11,665 --> 02:31:12,026
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah...

2149
02:31:13,107 --> 02:31:14,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone is supposed to be on the same page.

2150
02:31:14,728 --> 02:31:18,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't get me wrong, I'm glad Spazinator got what he wanted.

2151
02:31:18,370 --> 02:31:21,172
[SPEAKER_09]: He just should have gotten it the first time.

2152
02:31:21,292 --> 02:31:28,536
[SPEAKER_09]: If we can learn anything from this phone call, if you are at Sony, there's some edumacation to be done amongst your reps.

2153
02:31:28,756 --> 02:31:38,442
[SPEAKER_07]: This is also a prime example why every time you talk to someone in a call center, you write down their name, you write down the date and the time that you spoke with them, and you keep a track of what you talked about.

2154
02:31:38,622 --> 02:31:39,743
[SPEAKER_07]: They have to keep notes too.

2155
02:31:40,023 --> 02:31:41,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, I know Spaz... I'm sorry.

2156
02:31:41,463 --> 02:31:41,944
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's okay.

2157
02:31:42,184 --> 02:31:42,844
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's important.

2158
02:31:42,864 --> 02:31:44,364
[SPEAKER_09]: But Spazinator's dying to jump in here again.

2159
02:31:44,404 --> 02:31:44,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, Spaz.

2160
02:31:46,385 --> 02:31:49,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was going to say, granted, I never worked at a call center before.

2161
02:31:49,826 --> 02:31:54,988
[SPEAKER_01]: The closest thing to that is working at a grocery store at the front desk.

2162
02:31:55,628 --> 02:32:02,350
[SPEAKER_01]: But I basically talked about the initial response I got to, like, pre-apps.

2163
02:32:02,410 --> 02:32:04,211
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to interrupt that.

2164
02:32:04,231 --> 02:32:05,051
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually spoke to...

2165
02:32:06,226 --> 02:32:25,210
[SPEAKER_01]: having an off day, you know, every deal with, you know, asshole customers, you know, they weren't quite as friendly as I was, or maybe possibly, you know, the rep possibly having some kind of bad information or getting your information mixed up somehow.

2166
02:32:25,891 --> 02:32:35,713
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately, regardless of, you know, what the case may be, you know, ultimately I got my stuff back, which is the key thing there, so

2167
02:32:36,688 --> 02:32:55,086
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if, God forbid, I kept getting the same, you know, response time and time again, then I would have, you know, escalated the call to a supervisor like you three had suggested the first time this kind of thing happened.

2168
02:32:55,747 --> 02:33:00,011
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, it didn't come to that, but, you know, God forbid it.

2169
02:33:00,971 --> 02:33:14,323
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I was just going to say yay Sony for getting it right, but it is a bummer that it did take you a little bit of a run around to do it, but they made it right and we should recognize that at least it wasn't the doom and gloom we thought it was going to be.

2170
02:33:14,644 --> 02:33:21,470
[SPEAKER_09]: But Spazinator, I've got to wrap up because we've got to see if we can fit in one or two more calls, but do you have anything else or a footnote to this or anything else you want to share with the listeners?

2171
02:33:23,499 --> 02:33:33,056
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, nothing comes to mind, but I'll keep you guys posted on Twitter if there's anything that comes up or if I think anything early during the week.

2172
02:33:33,617 --> 02:33:33,877
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2173
02:33:34,037 --> 02:33:34,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds good, buddy.

2174
02:33:36,075 --> 02:33:37,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, good luck with everything.

2175
02:33:37,636 --> 02:33:38,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care, buddy.

2176
02:34:02,927 --> 02:34:03,247
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2177
02:34:03,587 --> 02:34:03,888
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2178
02:34:04,168 --> 02:34:06,989
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of torn because like, you know, I've bought things online.

2179
02:34:07,049 --> 02:34:10,691
[SPEAKER_09]: I've done the digital distribution thing, but I've kind of taken a lot of that for granted.

2180
02:34:10,731 --> 02:34:10,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

2181
02:34:11,171 --> 02:34:11,412
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2182
02:34:11,652 --> 02:34:13,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Just buy TV episodes sometimes online.

2183
02:34:13,673 --> 02:34:15,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if I'm behind on Supernatural.

2184
02:34:15,234 --> 02:34:18,615
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I like Netflix because Netflix, you know, you're not really buying anything.

2185
02:34:18,655 --> 02:34:19,336
[SPEAKER_09]: You just kind of rent it.

2186
02:34:19,656 --> 02:34:19,836
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2187
02:34:19,856 --> 02:34:22,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, let's do at least one more call here and then we're going to be on our way out.

2188
02:34:22,177 --> 02:34:23,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, you're on Orange Haunts Radio.

2189
02:34:23,098 --> 02:34:23,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2190
02:34:24,574 --> 02:34:40,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican, Actdeft Hey, Actdeft, I'm glad to see you weren't shaken too bad by the earthquake that happened last week, right before the show Yeah, we were shaken, but not stirred Not stirred, alright, well said What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

2191
02:34:42,220 --> 02:34:52,623
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to add about the Twitter topic I sent earlier about the Mexican game being developed and brought over by Konami.

2192
02:34:54,103 --> 02:35:01,845
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to add that it's being distributed here in Mexico but it's being distributed by another company.

2193
02:35:02,395 --> 02:35:11,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well that's good to know, because I think earlier I had said, oh ha ha, it's not coming out of Mexico, even though it's a Mexican game, but that's just, Konami's not putting it out there, someone else is.

2194
02:35:11,127 --> 02:35:11,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that makes sense.

2195
02:35:12,406 --> 02:35:16,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's actually made by Colombian and Mexican developers.

2196
02:35:16,969 --> 02:35:24,354
[SPEAKER_05]: It's being published, I think, by... Well, developed by... Sorry.

2197
02:35:25,575 --> 02:35:32,239
[SPEAKER_05]: The main development is being held here in Mexico, though Colombia is helping also over their studios.

2198
02:35:33,060 --> 02:35:41,866
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember the name of the development company, but it's just starting right now to develop games, and I really hope that

2199
02:35:43,227 --> 02:35:53,015
[SPEAKER_05]: This game at least develops or brings a market over Mexico because it's a very small market and it's starting right now.

2200
02:35:53,675 --> 02:36:04,764
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say, I can't say, and maybe you can correct me here, but I can't say I can think of any big games or even medium-sized games that we can say this game was developed in Mexico by a Mexican developer.

2201
02:36:04,964 --> 02:36:07,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Company or Columbia or any of these other places.

2202
02:36:08,009 --> 02:36:13,759
[SPEAKER_09]: This seems to be like the first game we're really at least that I'm aware of that is developed like that.

2203
02:36:14,844 --> 02:36:25,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's not really a market for Xbox 360 or PS3 games, maybe even Wii games that are developed at least this large.

2204
02:36:26,154 --> 02:36:40,006
[SPEAKER_05]: There may be cell phone games that are being developed here and are made by companies like Gameloft and other companies, but made for a console, it's pretty much the first.

2205
02:36:40,626 --> 02:36:41,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you see PS2 development?

2206
02:36:41,967 --> 02:36:53,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Because my thought would be that a lot of these countries that they're not really being supported with the 360 and PS3, it seems that maybe the PS2 is still big there.

2207
02:37:07,110 --> 02:37:11,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, the PS2 isn't that big right now.

2208
02:37:12,074 --> 02:37:14,957
[SPEAKER_05]: It's maybe the PS3 or the 360 maybe.

2209
02:37:15,797 --> 02:37:16,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, okay.

2210
02:37:16,798 --> 02:37:29,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe on other places like Brazil, and especially because of their import and taxes over there, the PS2 is starting to gain momentum there.

2211
02:37:29,428 --> 02:37:30,328
[SPEAKER_05]: But here...

2212
02:37:31,389 --> 02:37:39,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though the games, and I have talked about this before, the games are pretty expensive, but at least we're on the same market as America.

2213
02:37:41,495 --> 02:37:45,738
[SPEAKER_07]: You mentioned Brazil, and the first thing I thought of is, I thought the Master System was still big in Brazil.

2214
02:37:45,758 --> 02:37:47,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's still big.

2215
02:37:47,579 --> 02:37:48,580
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, whoa.

2216
02:37:49,140 --> 02:37:51,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they also have the re-releases.

2217
02:37:51,282 --> 02:37:54,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't we have a story about the Genesis repackaging that was coming out in Brazil?

2218
02:37:55,504 --> 02:37:58,566
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some interesting things going on with old school games in Latin America.

2219
02:37:58,606 --> 02:38:02,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, if I recall correctly, it's called the Bebo.

2220
02:38:03,109 --> 02:38:03,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's right.

2221
02:38:04,810 --> 02:38:10,393
[SPEAKER_05]: It was brought over here in Mexico, though it wasn't as big as in Brazil.

2222
02:38:10,813 --> 02:38:11,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

2223
02:38:12,176 --> 02:38:14,497
[SPEAKER_09]: I totally love Mexican wrestling I totally love Mexican wrestling

2224
02:38:39,853 --> 02:38:40,853
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, we'll see.

2225
02:38:40,913 --> 02:38:41,753
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll hope it does well.

2226
02:38:41,793 --> 02:38:48,115
[SPEAKER_09]: At least, if nothing else, help the development market down there and get some more games out of there of some ideas.

2227
02:38:48,775 --> 02:38:50,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else you want to share with the listeners real quick tonight, Actdeft?

2228
02:38:51,836 --> 02:38:56,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, only that we're okay over here in Mexicali.

2229
02:38:57,397 --> 02:39:00,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though it was a pretty big quake, there was only pretty much...

2230
02:39:02,830 --> 02:39:23,625
[SPEAKER_05]: The structural damages, there were only two lives lost and only a couple hundred of injuries, but other than that, we're pretty fine over here, though there are people that are needed of services and maybe camping tents and all that stuff, but

2231
02:39:26,586 --> 02:39:28,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Other than that, we're pretty good.

2232
02:39:29,007 --> 02:39:35,552
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully, at least here in America, the folks want to donate to the relief efforts.

2233
02:39:35,592 --> 02:39:37,413
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure the Red Cross has something set up.

2234
02:39:37,433 --> 02:39:41,756
[SPEAKER_09]: They always do for the cases like this, so definitely folks should look into that.

2235
02:39:41,776 --> 02:39:44,998
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad to hear that for the most part, everything's okay.

2236
02:39:45,098 --> 02:39:53,224
[SPEAKER_09]: It's sad that even one life was lost, but it sounds like it could have been a lot worse based on how bad the quake itself was.

2237
02:39:53,744 --> 02:39:59,275
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm glad to hear that at least you and everyone you care about are okay.

2238
02:40:00,537 --> 02:40:00,798
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2239
02:40:01,299 --> 02:40:03,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Actdeft, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show.

2240
02:40:03,282 --> 02:40:04,284
[SPEAKER_09]: But thanks so much for the call, okay?

2241
02:40:04,986 --> 02:40:05,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2242
02:40:05,446 --> 02:40:05,687
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2243
02:40:05,727 --> 02:40:06,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care, my friend.

2244
02:40:07,668 --> 02:40:09,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, that's going to do it for tonight's calls.

2245
02:40:09,590 --> 02:40:11,171
[SPEAKER_09]: And sorry for those folks that didn't get through.

2246
02:40:11,531 --> 02:40:18,938
[SPEAKER_09]: It was ringing pretty good tonight because we actually had a lot of people that were trying to get in tonight because of last week.

2247
02:40:18,978 --> 02:40:22,801
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, we got to wrap it up, you guys.

2248
02:40:23,642 --> 02:40:24,883
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm starting a new job tomorrow.

2249
02:40:24,923 --> 02:40:25,964
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't be here all night.

2250
02:40:26,905 --> 02:40:28,686
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura wants to go to bed eventually.

2251
02:40:29,267 --> 02:40:32,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Matt might want to go back to KFC and ask for a double down with no sauce.

2252
02:40:33,443 --> 02:40:33,823
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

2253
02:40:34,764 --> 02:40:36,364
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of hungry because I didn't eat anything.

2254
02:40:37,025 --> 02:40:38,065
[SPEAKER_07]: I offered to make ribs.

2255
02:40:38,665 --> 02:40:39,426
[SPEAKER_07]: You can have cake.

2256
02:40:39,446 --> 02:40:40,146
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't need ribs.

2257
02:40:40,186 --> 02:40:43,047
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to have healthy special case cereal when I go home.

2258
02:40:43,448 --> 02:40:43,748
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2259
02:40:44,208 --> 02:40:49,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, we got to wrap up, you guys, and get on out of here so we can... Ooh, our baked potato.

2260
02:40:49,510 --> 02:40:50,251
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to have baked potato.

2261
02:40:50,271 --> 02:40:50,551
[SPEAKER_09]: It's good.

2262
02:40:51,091 --> 02:40:51,471
[SPEAKER_09]: It's good.

2263
02:40:51,951 --> 02:40:52,332
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2264
02:40:52,792 --> 02:40:53,752
[SPEAKER_09]: We got a... Uh-oh.

2265
02:40:53,952 --> 02:40:54,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-oh.

2266
02:40:54,653 --> 02:40:56,754
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a stream down error.

2267
02:40:56,814 --> 02:40:58,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Winamp has crashed.

2268
02:40:58,895 --> 02:40:59,895
[SPEAKER_09]: God damn it.

2269
02:40:59,995 --> 02:41:00,275
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2270
02:41:00,315 --> 02:41:00,675
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay.

2271
02:41:00,695 --> 02:41:01,876
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to just keep going here.

2272
02:41:02,671 --> 02:41:03,752
[SPEAKER_10]: At least it's at the end of the show.

2273
02:41:04,692 --> 02:41:05,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, at least it's at the end of the show.

2274
02:41:05,853 --> 02:41:06,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on, guys.

2275
02:41:06,654 --> 02:41:07,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Dang it.

2276
02:41:09,395 --> 02:41:09,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Poopy!

2277
02:41:10,336 --> 02:41:14,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we're still recording for podcast, so can someone fill a little time here while I get us recorded?

2278
02:41:14,399 --> 02:41:16,820
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually trying to find something to send you for Cage Match.

2279
02:41:17,280 --> 02:41:17,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that's fine.

2280
02:41:17,801 --> 02:41:22,464
[SPEAKER_10]: I have the same problem, but then I found something.

2281
02:41:23,243 --> 02:41:25,364
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I was gonna... Who was the winning song last time?

2282
02:41:25,384 --> 02:41:25,864
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even remember.

2283
02:41:25,884 --> 02:41:27,265
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be, I think you, Rob.

2284
02:41:27,325 --> 02:41:29,005
[SPEAKER_09]: You were... Was I with the Goldfrapp song?

2285
02:41:29,025 --> 02:41:29,445
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't me.

2286
02:41:29,505 --> 02:41:30,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you were with the Goldfrapp song.

2287
02:41:30,926 --> 02:41:31,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that's fine.

2288
02:41:31,626 --> 02:41:33,347
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was gonna do like a throwaway.

2289
02:41:33,567 --> 02:41:34,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, there we go.

2290
02:41:34,407 --> 02:41:35,608
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're still going.

2291
02:41:35,788 --> 02:41:37,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Now we're back up and it's streaming on all games again.

2292
02:41:37,809 --> 02:41:38,589
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what happened.

2293
02:41:38,629 --> 02:41:39,129
[SPEAKER_09]: So, okay.

2294
02:41:39,609 --> 02:41:40,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Now we can actually wrap up the show.

2295
02:41:41,110 --> 02:41:42,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Winamp froze, you guys.

2296
02:41:42,530 --> 02:41:43,551
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why it does that.

2297
02:41:44,332 --> 02:41:44,993
[SPEAKER_09]: It's irritating.

2298
02:41:45,013 --> 02:41:45,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's Winamp.

2299
02:41:45,974 --> 02:41:46,375
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess.

2300
02:41:46,435 --> 02:41:48,197
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it might need to upgrade the version or something.

2301
02:41:48,257 --> 02:41:50,020
[SPEAKER_10]: They always bug me with that.

2302
02:41:50,160 --> 02:41:51,482
[SPEAKER_10]: You need to upgrade your version.

2303
02:41:51,562 --> 02:41:53,425
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have to run some tests before the next show.

2304
02:41:53,485 --> 02:41:53,845
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2305
02:41:53,885 --> 02:41:57,971
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's weird because just closing Skype shouldn't bork Winamp like that.

2306
02:41:58,011 --> 02:41:58,652
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what happened.

2307
02:41:59,393 --> 02:42:00,514
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, it is what it is.

2308
02:42:01,014 --> 02:42:05,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, we're still going to wrap up and be on out of here for the night.

2309
02:42:05,717 --> 02:42:06,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks so much for our Skype callers.

2310
02:42:07,217 --> 02:42:10,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys for listening to our show and supporting our independent radio.

2311
02:42:11,159 --> 02:42:13,881
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got to get last-minute stories, though, before I give my whole spiel here.

2312
02:42:13,901 --> 02:42:16,662
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like Matt has a million tabs open on Firefox over there.

2313
02:42:16,682 --> 02:42:17,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I do.

2314
02:42:17,483 --> 02:42:19,464
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a million instances of the unicorn game.

2315
02:42:20,484 --> 02:42:23,446
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, do you have any last-minute stories real quick before we go?

2316
02:42:25,023 --> 02:42:25,643
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to check.

2317
02:42:25,783 --> 02:42:27,544
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Loki then.

2318
02:42:27,924 --> 02:42:42,387
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so Dark Void Zero, that wonderful 2D version of, or 8-bit 2D version of the game Dark Zero that hit the DSiWare is now going to be hitting the iPhone and PC actually tomorrow.

2319
02:42:42,487 --> 02:42:43,728
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's pretty awesome.

2320
02:42:44,148 --> 02:42:47,249
[SPEAKER_10]: And it'll cost you $2.99 on the iPhone, $5 on PC.

2321
02:42:47,629 --> 02:42:48,209
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's not bad.

2322
02:42:48,289 --> 02:42:50,609
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually may purchase that for my arcade cabinet.

2323
02:42:50,790 --> 02:42:52,150
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that would fit in just nicely.

2324
02:42:54,451 --> 02:42:56,453
[SPEAKER_10]: and a game that I was playing earlier this week.

2325
02:42:58,214 --> 02:42:59,355
[SPEAKER_10]: I always have trouble pronouncing this.

2326
02:42:59,975 --> 02:43:03,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Escaluda 2 will be hitting the iPhone as well.

2327
02:43:04,178 --> 02:43:10,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, actually it should have already hit the iPhone because that would have been on the 10th.

2328
02:43:10,743 --> 02:43:11,583
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

2329
02:43:12,364 --> 02:43:19,229
[SPEAKER_07]: My friend linked a Japanese video of that in and I was actually already looking for it but I don't know that

2330
02:43:19,824 --> 02:43:21,565
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how well I controlled it on the iPhone.

2331
02:43:21,925 --> 02:43:24,326
[SPEAKER_07]: It looked pretty responsive on that video.

2332
02:43:24,866 --> 02:43:26,386
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm totally thinking about getting it.

2333
02:43:27,767 --> 02:43:28,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Very cool.

2334
02:43:29,908 --> 02:43:30,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see here.

2335
02:43:31,208 --> 02:43:37,651
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there's some interesting tie-ins apparently with Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker.

2336
02:43:38,591 --> 02:43:40,612
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to have two different games tied in with it.

2337
02:43:40,712 --> 02:43:45,453
[SPEAKER_10]: First one, Monster Hunter is actually going to be tied in with it as well.

2338
02:43:45,794 --> 02:43:46,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G is

2339
02:43:49,875 --> 02:43:57,661
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess there's going to be content from that game that's going to be able to work with Peace Walker, which is weird.

2340
02:43:58,602 --> 02:44:10,872
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently the little cat-like characters, the felines that appear in the Monster Hunter series are going to appear in the Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker game as well.

2341
02:44:11,453 --> 02:44:12,894
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's interesting.

2342
02:44:13,774 --> 02:44:35,073
[SPEAKER_10]: and then another weird one that's a crossover apparently you will also be able to link up Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker with Front Mission Evolved on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 players will be able to exchange parts acquired from Peace Walker bosses in Front Mission Evolved

2343
02:44:35,885 --> 02:44:37,286
[SPEAKER_10]: How the hell does that work?

2344
02:44:37,807 --> 02:44:38,887
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's interesting.

2345
02:44:40,729 --> 02:44:43,511
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can use them for your mechs that you build in that game.

2346
02:44:43,811 --> 02:44:46,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Talk about cross-company promotions there.

2347
02:44:46,493 --> 02:44:48,275
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of neat, actually.

2348
02:44:49,295 --> 02:44:51,417
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually want to check out that new Peace Walker game.

2349
02:44:51,757 --> 02:44:53,078
[SPEAKER_10]: Or Front Mission.

2350
02:44:54,239 --> 02:44:56,781
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, Professor Layton is actually coming over here.

2351
02:44:56,821 --> 02:44:58,062
[SPEAKER_10]: It's getting a western release.

2352
02:44:58,182 --> 02:44:59,363
[SPEAKER_10]: The movie, that is.

2353
02:45:00,544 --> 02:45:02,125
[SPEAKER_10]: Developed by Level 5.

2354
02:45:02,166 --> 02:45:02,386
[SPEAKER_10]: And...

2355
02:45:05,217 --> 02:45:06,619
[SPEAKER_10]: Dead or Alive Paradise

2356
02:45:25,899 --> 02:45:33,563
[SPEAKER_10]: People have found a way to swap out the textures in the game and now we get wonderful nipple-less naked women.

2357
02:45:33,843 --> 02:45:36,644
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure it wasn't very hard with a Dead or Alive game.

2358
02:45:36,704 --> 02:45:39,806
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, that game is five bucks on iTunes and I'm buying it right now.

2359
02:45:41,546 --> 02:45:42,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Espagaluda?

2360
02:45:42,247 --> 02:45:43,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2361
02:45:43,147 --> 02:45:43,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Fun.

2362
02:45:43,287 --> 02:45:43,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2363
02:45:43,667 --> 02:45:45,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Good luck controlling it on the iPhone.

2364
02:45:46,845 --> 02:45:48,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Just not my favorite gaming platform.

2365
02:45:49,806 --> 02:45:55,249
[SPEAKER_10]: And then finally, there was a patent filed for Rumble in a DS.

2366
02:45:55,389 --> 02:45:57,109
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm assuming it's going to be in the 3DS.

2367
02:45:57,730 --> 02:45:58,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm sure.

2368
02:45:58,130 --> 02:46:02,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think there's been rumblings of Rumble for quite some time.

2369
02:46:03,072 --> 02:46:03,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2370
02:46:03,792 --> 02:46:06,193
[SPEAKER_10]: And hopefully dual analog sticks would be nice.

2371
02:46:06,213 --> 02:46:06,913
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be great.

2372
02:46:07,934 --> 02:46:09,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Because everybody likes dual analog sticks.

2373
02:46:09,815 --> 02:46:10,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Not going to hold my breath, though.

2374
02:46:11,915 --> 02:46:14,037
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a couple things thrown at me here in chat.

2375
02:46:14,477 --> 02:46:22,661
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100Matt reminded me that I don't think we ever mentioned the winner of USL Madness or the March Madness, if you will, that happens on Orange Launch Radio.

2376
02:46:22,681 --> 02:46:26,323
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we were off the week it ended and then, of course, last week's show was just off.

2377
02:46:27,103 --> 02:46:29,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Chrono Trigger won for the first time.

2378
02:46:29,885 --> 02:46:32,086
[SPEAKER_09]: It was declared the greatest game of all time.

2379
02:46:32,126 --> 02:46:32,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Timed.

2380
02:46:33,760 --> 02:46:38,383
[SPEAKER_09]: I thoroughly disagree with your votes, but whatever.

2381
02:46:38,543 --> 02:46:42,346
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's not like Chrono Trigger's a bad game, but I guess it was destined to win one of these years.

2382
02:46:42,906 --> 02:46:47,589
[SPEAKER_09]: I've just decided in these contests, people just vote the way I don't vote.

2383
02:46:48,710 --> 02:46:51,872
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know if it's a ha-ha, let's make Rob mad or whatever, but whatever.

2384
02:46:52,572 --> 02:46:56,355
[SPEAKER_09]: I can think of a lot of games, a lot of games worse than Chrono Trigger.

2385
02:46:57,215 --> 02:47:01,518
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yay Chrono Trigger and yay everybody that participated and boo and poop on those that didn't.

2386
02:47:01,658 --> 02:47:11,950
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, as TychoClaw points out, Microsoft has changed the increments of which you have to purchase Microsoft Points to more manageable numbers instead of some weird rounded off numbers.

2387
02:47:12,470 --> 02:47:15,514
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually 400 and 800 and 1,600 and 4,000.

2388
02:47:15,834 --> 02:47:16,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it really?

2389
02:47:16,495 --> 02:47:16,695
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2390
02:47:17,036 --> 02:47:18,177
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd heard that they were doing that.

2391
02:47:18,457 --> 02:47:20,019
[SPEAKER_09]: So they got rid of 500, 1,000, all that all together?

2392
02:47:20,059 --> 02:47:20,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah.

2393
02:47:21,741 --> 02:47:22,341
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2394
02:47:38,873 --> 02:48:04,726
[SPEAKER_09]: one of the things they're trying to do to I guess you could say either compete with Netflix or Gamefly or both they are doing their games by mail service it's going to cost an extra $7.99 plus tax on top of the standard I guess you could say monthly fees you'll be able to rent one game at a time and that's the total number of discs that you're allowed to have out on the plan so there you go if you don't check any games out during the one month period though you're not charged the money

2395
02:48:05,126 --> 02:48:06,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of interesting how that all works.

2396
02:48:07,289 --> 02:48:09,592
[SPEAKER_09]: It's currently being tested in Cleveland, Ohio.

2397
02:48:10,333 --> 02:48:11,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Because Cleveland rocks.

2398
02:48:12,015 --> 02:48:13,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Cleveland rocks, Ohio.

2399
02:48:14,899 --> 02:48:17,362
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm thinking actually, you say that, I think of Howard the Duck.

2400
02:48:18,483 --> 02:48:20,106
[SPEAKER_07]: You live in Cleveland.

2401
02:48:21,267 --> 02:48:21,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Drew Carey Show.

2402
02:48:22,355 --> 02:48:24,057
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't watch that.

2403
02:48:24,237 --> 02:48:25,619
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like 10 years ago.

2404
02:48:25,779 --> 02:48:27,080
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't watch that.

2405
02:48:27,641 --> 02:48:29,443
[SPEAKER_09]: They even had a Rocky Horror themed episode.

2406
02:48:29,523 --> 02:48:31,025
[SPEAKER_09]: I did see that.

2407
02:48:31,045 --> 02:48:31,926
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll see.

2408
02:48:32,607 --> 02:48:35,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, then how did you not watch the show yet see that episode?

2409
02:48:35,450 --> 02:48:36,371
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw the clip on YouTube.

2410
02:48:36,451 --> 02:48:37,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, YouTube.

2411
02:48:37,472 --> 02:48:38,674
[SPEAKER_09]: YouTube, it ruins everything.

2412
02:48:39,234 --> 02:48:39,515
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2413
02:48:40,256 --> 02:48:41,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, I think we're done.

2414
02:48:41,557 --> 02:48:41,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that it?

2415
02:48:42,018 --> 02:48:43,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know what your story is, Loki?

2416
02:48:43,644 --> 02:48:45,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, all the ones I wanted to do.

2417
02:48:45,805 --> 02:48:47,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Some guy beat some Asteroids record too.

2418
02:48:48,946 --> 02:48:52,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey now, don't haze Tigerclaw in chat.

2419
02:48:52,147 --> 02:48:53,607
[SPEAKER_09]: This isn't the Tigerclaw link show.

2420
02:48:53,987 --> 02:48:54,647
[SPEAKER_09]: He does a good job.

2421
02:48:55,087 --> 02:48:57,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft says Tigerclaw more efficient than Google.

2422
02:48:57,168 --> 02:48:57,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously.

2423
02:48:57,688 --> 02:49:02,129
[SPEAKER_10]: And DanMufrogerReturns is apparently hopping up on DSiWare as well.

2424
02:49:03,090 --> 02:49:03,910
[SPEAKER_10]: Cannot die.

2425
02:49:04,090 --> 02:49:04,951
[SPEAKER_09]: I cannot die.

2426
02:49:05,011 --> 02:49:14,496
[SPEAKER_09]: This is why I like doing a show with a live chat room because when I don't know the answer instead of sitting here looking like an idiot or making something up, I mean, I still look like an idiot, but I'll just go, hey, chat, what was the answer to that?

2427
02:49:14,756 --> 02:49:15,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody always knows.

2428
02:49:16,257 --> 02:49:18,818
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it involves a link, Tiger Claw has it in five seconds.

2429
02:49:18,998 --> 02:49:20,019
[SPEAKER_09]: If not, SSJ100 Matt.

2430
02:49:20,239 --> 02:49:21,460
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a little friendly competition.

2431
02:49:21,740 --> 02:49:23,741
[SPEAKER_09]: We should have a total board.

2432
02:49:25,692 --> 02:49:26,192
[SPEAKER_09]: or something.

2433
02:49:26,732 --> 02:49:27,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, anyhow.

2434
02:49:28,032 --> 02:49:29,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, thank you guys so much.

2435
02:49:29,393 --> 02:49:31,213
[SPEAKER_09]: All the chatters that help make the show happen.

2436
02:49:31,253 --> 02:49:33,433
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys really are the fourth guest on the show, always.

2437
02:49:34,134 --> 02:49:35,434
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, you guys for listening.

2438
02:49:35,474 --> 02:49:38,874
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we have a lot of people on the podcast who just can't be here for whatever reason Sunday night.

2439
02:49:39,174 --> 02:49:42,775
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you guys so much for downloading our show and tuning in and supporting Independent Radio.

2440
02:49:43,095 --> 02:49:45,216
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are awesome and thanks so much.

2441
02:49:45,276 --> 02:49:52,917
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, all we say, if you enjoy the show, just tell somebody you know about the show or leave a nice review on iTunes or some other podcast site.

2442
02:49:53,157 --> 02:49:53,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Cake!

2443
02:50:16,969 --> 02:50:18,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, do you have a final thought for us tonight?

2444
02:50:18,690 --> 02:50:24,233
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm hoping to finish Final Fantasy XIII soon, although I have a feeling I'm not going to be able to because I have to get all the achievements.

2445
02:50:25,053 --> 02:50:27,274
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have lots of games to start playing.

2446
02:50:29,215 --> 02:50:35,358
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is the website ffxivcore.com is making me foam at the mouth.

2447
02:50:37,162 --> 02:50:38,343
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really what it boils down to.

2448
02:50:39,163 --> 02:50:40,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, thank you guys again.

2449
02:50:41,024 --> 02:50:41,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a great week.

2450
02:50:41,825 --> 02:50:46,408
[SPEAKER_09]: We will be back next week with more of Orange Lounge Radio to do this all over again.

2451
02:50:47,568 --> 02:50:49,509
[SPEAKER_09]: New stories and all that other stuff.

2452
02:50:50,130 --> 02:50:52,831
[SPEAKER_09]: But the same old crap that you've come to love week to week.

2453
02:50:53,692 --> 02:50:58,355
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2454
02:51:00,560 --> 02:51:02,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

2455
02:51:02,120 --> 02:51:04,881
[SPEAKER_09]: To join us for a live show, visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6pm PT.

2456
02:51:26,207 --> 02:51:28,169

2457
02:51:28,189 --> 02:51:28,730
[SPEAKER_02]: See you next week!
